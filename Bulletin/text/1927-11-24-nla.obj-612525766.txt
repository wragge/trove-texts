The Death of English Poetry
Modern Poetry is at a dangerously low
ebb; two or three of the old giants still
remain, but their voices are growing fainter,
they sing ever to the old tune, adorably
perhaps, but even the dulcet tones ol
Venus would grow monotonous if there
murmured no other tongues to listen to.
Walter de la Mare continues his quiet,
inimitable way, but there is a frailness in
his work, a lack of emotional content, that
is becoming a trifle wearisome. W. H.
Davies remains as simple and charming as
ever, invariably so. But what of the others?
Who is there now living to carry on Eng-
land’s great heritage of poetry? For, since
Greece, no country has given such songs
as that small island on whose turf the
living feet of Marlowe and Shakspeare once
trod. The tide is ebbing. Such delicate
rhymsters as Robert Graves, Harold Mun-
roe, W. J. Turner, James Stephens and
Ralph Hodgson have seemingly petered out.
The powerful blank verse of Gordon Bot-
tomley has disappeared; Lascelles Abercrom-
bie has given us next to nothing since his
incomparable Phoenix. The Sitwells, find-
ing nobody left to fight, are taking up the
cudgels of prose. Bridges and Yeats are
both growing old, only occasionally finding
time to scribble a verse or two, and the
latter appears to find Astrology of more
interest than his old love, Verse. Every-
where there is a thinning, a falling off, of
English poetry.
For a time Humbert Wolfe showed
promise of being above the average. He
was careless and had a liking for false
rhymes (false rhymes can be used to good
effect as De la Mare has shown, but they
must be used sparingly, and Wolfe never
realised that), but there was vitality in his
work, a lust after power and strong imagery,
the restless desire of youth to crystallise the
beauty of earth into magic lines. Women’s
hands enthralled him, and no other poet has
painted them so beautifully. But these
were only occasional flashes of loveli-
ness; he grew more slovenly, he wrote far
too quickly and too much. Recently, he
published a slim narrative called “News of
the Devil,” and it seemed for a moment
that he had returned, that here at last was
something solidly beautiful. Alas! the old
ease of writing seized him; he grew too
agile, too slick; lie rambled on, sliding from
false rhyme to worse rhyme, from careless-
ness to banality. Nothing, I think, is more
tragic than such a book as this, that holds
the grains of genius yet fails because of
the author’s own laziness.
“News of the Devil” is an attack on com-
mercialism and on the press, and as such
it is sometimes excellent. The hero, Mr.
Paul Arthur, is a publisher of 20-odd news-
papers who suddenly conceives the idea of
reorganising religion, making it, through
advertising, a universal complaint. But
Mr. Arthur realises that he knows really
nothing about religion; he remembers the
Creation, the Fall, Christ and St Paul, “but,
which was rather odd, Mr. Paul Arthur had
forgotten God.” In the middle of this
gigantic scheme Mr. Arthur suddenly dies,
and has a conversation with the Devil. To
that point the book is excellent; but Mr.
Wolfe begins to tire, his pen wanders on,
suddenly breaking into amazingly beauti-
ful passages only to return to incomprehen-
sible dulness. It is tragic, because here
and there true greatness manages to leak
through. There is power, too, in some of
the lines. When he likes, Mr. Wolfe can hit
out, and hit hard:—
The Press needs trouble.
Don’t fret at bubbles pricked; blow a new bubble.
Never tell truth unmixed or unmixed lies.
Always forget, never apologise.
For headlines every man is half a hero,
And equally for headlines half a Nero.
Remember, therefore, in your warmest praise
To note the hero’s weaknesses—in case.
Nothing’s too high to spoil, too low to use.
The sole criterion is and must be news.
There is one only law, one only virtue,
Desert your friends before your friends desert you.
And finally there is but one damnation,
A failure to maintain your circulation.
This may not be poetry, but it is satire
worthy of Martial; and in such a dearth as
that of to-day even this is refreshing. But
with this power in his hands, of mocking
cynicism and a gift for beauty, Humbert
Wolfe flings all aside .to delve into the
morass of banality, to go wandering inco-
herently on, boring the reader painfully.
Here, perhaps; is the last of the English
poets. Who knows? There seems'no glim-
mering of a renaissance there or in America,
and the tired wanderer into foreign lands
must return thankfully to his native home.
Patriotism has nothing to do with' it, but
I truly believe that here, in our own Aus-
tralia, will come tlie young, vital blood, the
new English poetry. With men like Hugh
McCrae, Kenneth Slessor, Robert D. Fitz-
Gerald and a dozen others we have in our
heart the saving of English verse. And it
is growing, new names are coming, new men
are rising to carry oil the work of the
gigantic Elizabethans. It is still the Eng-
lish renaissance, if in a younger land.
L. PHILLIFS.
The Real and the Unreal
The popular argument against those
dreadful realists who began to plague us
so 30 years ago was our petulant insistence
that we didn’t want the truth; we wanted a
story. The truth, we said, was a thing that
we knew; why then should we pay money
to read it? Rqmaace was what we were
after; something that couldn’t happen. God
knew that the things that did happen were
sombre enough; there was no need to go
to the length of putting the wretched busi-
ness on record in print. But it was no
good. The realists beat us in the end, and
gave us nothing but the increasingly sad-
dening truth, obstetrically depressing, or
otherwise, as the case might be.
Or did they only think they had beaten
us? Perhaps they still think the victory
is to them? Then, 30-odd years after they
started the trouble, let us, as Michael Arlen
the Armenian says in his so-English way,
face it. Decadence (Cassells; Dymock’s),
Maxim Gorki’s first novel after 10 years of
silence, is a realistic story from Russia.
Clara Barron (Cape; Dymock’s), by
Harvey O’Higgins, is another, from
America. And Mr. Fortune’s Maggot
(Chatto and Windus; Dymock’s) is a
fairy-tale from England, by Sylvia Towns-
end Warner.
Maxim Gorki tells us the story of the dis-
integration of the Artamanovs, a peasant
family who established a factory and be-
came industrial kings. In three genera-
tions they reach their apex, run their heads
against the Revolution, and vanish in
despair. We see them in their moods of
ill-temper, drunkenness, sex-craving, mean-
ness, animal gluttony; in all their sub-
normal and accidental reactions they are
presented to us in withering detail, that be-
ing the realistic pattern. In this way we
get a vigorous picture of succeeding groups
of men and women, all violent and weak-
minded and all essentially pathetic in their
physical realism. One has a half-apologetic
feeling that it isn’t fair to catch these poor
people so very intimately; it is like spying
on an embarrassed child and trying to
Judge the child’s character by his reaction
to the bashful accidental moment.
So all these Artamanovs, their wives,
children, mistresses, drinking-mates, are
blurred, there being nothing but this
physical realism to show them. Their
deeds and careers are blurred, the
one certainty to emerge being the
impossibility of such violent weaklings
ever establishing a factory or becoming in-
dustrial kings. The taking of a sequence
of “let-down” moods and moments in a
man’s life with the excluding of all his
“get-up” impulses must show his character
as mentally unbalanced. So there are no
Artamanovs and no industrial career; there
are only these groups of shadowy inade-
quates blundering to their downfall'. “Stark”
realism must obviously narrow the vision
instead of widening it—that is one of the
stock arguments; but “Decadence” goes
farther than that, and makes us a present
of its proof that realism can completely
destroy its own reason for existence as well
as its immediate story.
Harvey O’Higgins is much better than
the famous Maxim Gorki. His study of
repression is realistic, but.it is psychological
realism, which is as artistically legitimate
as the mere unadorned truth can be made.
The story is beautifully told, with a cold
impersonal impassivity quite faultless in
its effect. We are taken deep into the heart
and mind of Clara Barron, and shown, not
her impulses and motives, but the gradual
evidence of them in her life. Only when
the superhumanly skilful story is finished
do we realise what was the matter with
Clara Barron. Admiring the cruel power of
the job, the relentless austerity of the
writing (I mean sincerely admiring; the
book is a wonderful example of how to let
your story tell itself), we are yet conscious
of two things. In giving us the evidence
of the repression of this woman’s heroically
passionate nature the author has left out
the beauty that such a nature would force
into her compensations for the repression;
for the sake of the realism, the substance
of his theme, he makes these compensa-
tions all tasks. The second thing co-
ordinates with the first; twice in the book
is one conscious that Clara has come beauti-
fully to life as a woman and not merely as
a type; when she is furnishing and moving
into her new flat, and when Wayl, delirious
with influenza, creeps half unconsciously
into her bed. One knows that the law of
contrast is technically at the bottom of this
effectiveness; but one knows also that the
moment we leave the relentless realism of
the pattern and enter romance with ita
indeterminate expression, its emotionalism,
its vivid foolishness, the story is alive and
lovable as well as merely superlatively
admirable as an example of psychological
realism.
Sylvia Townsend Warner is austere in her
contempt of realism. The tale of Mr.
Fortune’s whimsy rests for its effect entirely
upon its unreality. He is a middle-aged
missionary who in Fanua makes but one
convert to Christianity, the beloved Lueli.
But in stress Lueli returns to his own god,
and Mr. Fortune sees that he has made not
one convert in Fanua. An earthquake
destroys Lueli’s idol; the beloved Lueli
pines .away, near to the gates of death;
helplessly watching him Mr. Fortune real-
ises that he too has lost his traditional god.

Thinking this surprising thing over, he
carves a new god for Lueli, who promptly
braces up and turns his back on the gates
of death. Lueli thus having converted Mr.
Fortune, the latter leaves Fanua content to
face a world in which, at the ultimate tri-
bunal, each man’s god is God.
Throughout her allegory the author
adheres strictly to romance in both treat-
ment and structure. Mr. Fortune comes
dreaming to Fanua, remains there in a
dream, and goes upheld by dream. A
finesse of delicate humor keeps every sen-
tence alive and singing; the charm, the
romantic charm, broods over every scene.
Through the flexible sweetness of the pat-
tern the eyes of all middle-aged men shine,
hungry for some god who will outlast the
years. Through it the beauty of selfless
love gleams. It is romance, in short; and
surely its rich reality is better than any
realism.
HILARY LOFTING.
Authors’ Week in Melbourne
“The tumult and the shouting dies,
The captains and the kings depart”
Authors’ week has slipped into the past,
and the critics who loomed large in the
turmoil have become the toads under the
harrow.
We are a young people and a lazy people,
and the shadow of Imperialism still lies
heavy on us. Why trouble when the other
fellow is willing to think for us, we say—
and if his thought is not our thought, nor
what our thought should be if we were
industrious and Australian-spirited enough
to think for ourselves, why worry? It is,
in the language of all good lazy people,
“near enough.” That is the real reason for
the impeachment of certain judgments
passed by certain more (or perhaps less)
competent critics during authors’ -week.
The week, apart from whatever com-
mercial punch it carried (chiefly remark-
able for selling off troublesome remainders,
apparently), was, from the literary point
of view, the sorriest of farces. It was
marked by two outstanding features. One
was the orderly track of the University
grindstone, that nice implement which the
|ate Gyles Turner was wont to insist
“dimmed diamonds and polished pebbles”;
the other was the classification of authors,
with mathematical precision and in immut-
able order of merit, into iozens and half-
dozens.
It was ever so. A quotation from a
newspaper of 1837, seen lately, spoke of
Scott, Southey and Moore as completing
the number of first-class poets of the nine-
teenth century. Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Keats and Shelley were not even men-
tioned as “also rans.” It makes one gasp;
but there you are—good intentions and
general public laziness. The daring of
fools and the reticence of angels account
for many things. Humanity hasn’t changed
very much, after all, and the Old Adam
still leavens our ethics, even our literary
ethics. It has been said that a critic writes
according to the state of his liver and the
fashion of the times. It may be so, since
even a little of the ancient grudge between
the sister capitals was carried against some
at least of the Northern poets, so that
more than one laurel wreath was trodden
in the dust.
And this recalls that if one critic’s dictum
is accepted there will be no more horses
m poetry, Australian or otherwise. This
critic has tried to read Gordon many times,
he says, with no result but mental dys-
pepsia. Sport, he says, has no place in
poetry. Alas for the vulgar preservers of
the Classic! Alas for Pindar!
Another Melbourne critic spoke authorita-
tively of the legion of Gordon-inspired
horse-poets. Needless to say he is a city-
dweller who has no more conception of
what the horse has meant to the evolution
of the Australian than a pond frog has of
what the great waters have meant to the
economy of a right whale.
The trouble with the critics must be
summed up again as our colossal laziness.
If at an agricultural show a fully-qualified
draper was appointed as judge in the
heavy-draughts section, what a howl of
disapproval it would raise! Why, then,
should not an equally strong protest be
lodged against the nicest dilettante that
Oxford can turn out when his practical
knowledge is limited to Oxford? The great
book of Australia, the study of which is
necessary to any comprehensive study of
Australian literature, is to him closed, with
all its pages uncut. But, as I said before,
because we are a lazy people we don’t care
a hang if a draper does judge the brave
plough-horses who have turned the first
furrow of authentic poetry in Australia.
According to some of these gentlemen
also, Australian atmosphere, gum-trees,
sheep, drovers, as well as horses, should be
strictly eliminated from Australian poetry.
Any allusion to native fauna, of course,
would be unthinkably vulgar. Perhaps the
correct poet of the future will be given to
using dashes to Indicate the unavoidable
atrocity if he is unfortunate enough to find
it necessary to the complete sense of his
paragraph or stanza.
The worst part of such criticism is the
harm done to Young Australia. The same
men will tell us -we have no Australian
literature; that such as we have is only an
extension of English literature. They
might postulate further we have no Aus-
tralia; it is only an. extension of England.
We have a very live Australia. The late
war proved also to some people—some of
us knew it before—that there was a very
definite Australian character, and it didn’t
express itself always according to English
precedents. We have already the beginning
of an Australian literature, and the poets
and storytellers who have been true to
their stars have written what the
have lived—life in a great new land un-
trammelled by the traditions and conditions
of older civilisations. What is more, we
want such writers to give us more of the
real Australia. As one of our truest Aus-
tralian bards, E. J. Brady, said in a late
article, speaking of the generation of
Australian bush singers who have been
writing of an Australia that is passing:
We are riders towards the sunset.
Behind us is the Australia of the pioneers;
the Australia of epic struggles, of splendid
defeats and of magnificent conquests. The
history of a new country is not made in
its cities. It is not made in its marts and
in its churches and in its schools, but out
in the Never Never, where the track is
blazed with bones—the bones of brave men
and gallant horses. It is made where the
works-gang carries the road a few miles
further out and the grim bush snarls—but
retreats. Out where the singing wire is
carried by creek and billabong, through
flood and fire to the hill that will one day
lift, scintillant with the spires of a city. It
is made where the railway gang carries the
railhead into the wilderness and buries its
dead as it goes. The station homestead,
with its nearest neighbor a hundred miles
away; the little lonely farm; the getters of
gold; the hewers of timber—all have con-
tributed to make the history of a young
country, and they have made it with their
sweat and their blood. Those who keep
their chronicles must have felt their wounds.
They must be blood of those who have
bled who would dare to write of things as
they were for those who are to come.
MAGNET.
Melba’s Successor
No teacher in Australia nor anywhere
else in the world will be able to produce a
legitimate successor to Melba unless he can
find a singer possessing not only an equally
good voice, but also the same unique en-
dowment of brains, musicianship, taste,
personality and will-power. Teachers in
London, Paris and Milan, as well as Aus-
tralia, have had the pick of our voices
during the last 30 years, but we are still
awaiting the advent of a second Melba.
Meantime, let us give credit where it is
due. Four of the London singers men-
tioned in Dr. Keith Barry’s list of those
maintaining Australia’s vocal reputation
abroad received a lengthy training at the
N.S.W. State Conservatorium, and, after
achieving considerable success in their own
country and Maoriland, went overseas in
search of greater opportunities. These four,
Rosa Alba, Essie Ackland, Ethel Osborn,
Clifford Lathlean, and one other not men-
tioned, Gladys Verona, who recently re-
turned, all succeeded in getting a foothold
without first having to undergo “a long
and expensive course of training in London
or Paris,” which Dr. Barry implies is always
necessary. That they should, while singing
professionally, continue to study is natural
and inevitable. A true artist’s study is never-
ending; Sir Henry Wood, for example,
derives quite a large portion of his in-
come from coaching—at the rate of 30s.
per half-hour—artists already well known
to the British public. Other London
teachers are freely patronised by profes-
sional singers who wish to keep themselves
up to the mark.
I was present at the London debut of
Ethel Osborn in the huge Albert Hall, with
the London Symphony Orchestra conducted
by Sir Landon Ronald, only a few weeks
after her arrival. Her singing created a
furore, three successive encores being de-
manded, and she received highly favorable
criticisms next day from every London
paper. “She takes definite rank among the
great singers who have come here from
Australia,” was the Daily Sketch’s
opinion. The Evening News described
her as “a practised and well-trained
soprano”; the Daily Telegraph considered
her to be “unquestionably something of a
trouvaille”; and the mighty Times, the
Morning Post, Chronicle and Daily
Mail all joined in the chorus of praise.
Had Miss Osborn’s undoubted su'ccess been
the result of some London teacher’s work,
one could have understood Dr. Barry’s
assertion that we badly need someone cap-
able of doing justice to Australian voices.
But while Australian singers continue to
show, like Ethel Osborn, Essie Ackland,
Gladys Moncrieff, Florence Austral, Horace
Stevens, Gertrude Johnson and many
others, that the training received in their
own country is sufficient to give them a
good start in the race for success, why
worry? Teachers in the great centres
abroad have this advantage—their pupils
can make a big reputation and a big in-
come without having, like our rising artists,
to travel to the other side of the world.
Had Miss Osborn been a pupil of some
London teacher, such a success would have
gained instant recognition and placed him
at the top of the tree.
WALTER THORMAN.
A Satchel of Books
Our Cockney Ancestors, by Kenneth Hare
(Benn). An attempt to re-create the life
of London. The author takes his reader for
a walk in Chaucer’s London, spends a holi-
day in Shakspeare’s London, and so on,
bringing to life again by deft outlines and
picturesque touches the men and manners of
past centuries.
Pass On, by Florence Lawford (Werner
Laurie). A quiet, domestic story of the Vic-
torian type in which true love and a
clergyman are elements.
Passionate Particles, by Margaret Peter-
son (Benn). The story of Ann Fabian, an
unwelcome child. A novel of unusual ear-
nestness and depth of sympathy.
The Seven Lovers, by Muriel Hine (John
Lane). A volume of short stories of which
the one giving a title to the book occupies
almost half its space. Though without the
distinctive qualities (which, marked “The,
Hurcotts,” every one of them carries a
genuine interest.
The Glorious Adventure, by Richard Hali-
burton (Geoffrey Bles). Young Richard
Haliburton opened a volume of Tennyson’s
poems at “Ulysses.” Being independent of
the boring necessity of toil, the brilliant
thought occurred to him “Why not follow in
the track of Ulysses from Troy to Ithaca?”
He did so; swam the Hellespont; climbed
Olympus ; ran the Marathon track and three
times round the windy walls of Troy. And
now he has written a book, brisk, breezy
and egotistical.
The Letters of Laurence Sterne (John
Lome). The letters hav'e been selected by R.
Brimley Johnson, who contributes an interest-
ing introductory chapter. Of the author of
“Tristram Shandy” and “The Sentimental
Journey” he remarks : “It is impossible not to
love the creator of Uncle Toby; impossible
to respect Laurence Sterne,” who deliberately
added suggestiveness to his platonic sus-
ceptibility with the object of shocking his
readers and thus advertising himself as the
clergyman who dared.
The Marvellous Land of Sncrgs, by E. A.
Wyke-Smith (Benn). Intended for young
folk, but not without interest to such elders
as may be able still to enjoy a fantasy.
The “Society for the Removal of Superfluous
Children” transplants its young charges to
the land of the Snergs—an offshoot of the
pixies of Fairyland—and the narrative, with
characteristic illustrations, tells what hap-
pened to a couple of the not-wanteds who
went adventuring on their own in a strange
land. Ingenious, and told with skill.
The Holy Lover, by Marie Conway Orm-
ler (Heinemann). Under this title the author
of “The Butterfly Man” and other well-
written novels develops the story of John
Wesley when he and lfis brother Charles
w T ere Episcopalian missionaries in the newly-
founded colony of Georgia. How John—the
founder in later days of Methodism in Eng-
land —fell under the spell of charming
Sophia Hopkey and for a time vacillated
between the pull of sex and church makes up
a human, if not wholly authentic, document
that will arouse interest.
Leo Tolstoy (Heinemann). The private
diary of the Russian author in the forma-
tive years of 1853-57, edited by Aylmer
Maude and translated by him in collabora-
tion with Louise Maude. A Russian edition
was also issued, but in France, the Soviet
Government having banned its circulation in
the land of the Bolshevik. The diary is a
human document in which small matters of
toilet, food, amusements and petty ailments
are bundled together with literary com-
ments and reflections. How very human
and sexually frail genius may be in its
domestic life!
Liberal Points of View (Benn). A col-
lection, of addresses by Gilbert Murray,
J. A. Spender, H. D. Henderson, Ramsay
Muir, T. E. Gregory and others, edited by
H. L. Nathan and H. Heathcote Williams,
with a foreword by Lloyd George. “This
book,” says the Liberal leader, “will help
to give to a perplexed generation a fair view
of the contribution which the Liberal party
is prepared to make to the solution of the
urgent problems of the day.” The addresses
were originally delivered as part of a scheme
of propaganda aiming at a systematic
attempt to restate the Liberal philosophy
in its application to the major problems of
the day. They cover foreign policy, the pro-
duction and distribution of wealth, industry,
freetrade, the international outlook, Liberal-
ism and the Empire and other subjects of
significance.
A Subaltern on the Somme, by Mark VII.
(Dent). “We are a mixed company, High-
landers, Australians, a Guardsman, ami hone
above the rank of captain. The Australians
are very characteristic, good-natured, devil-
may-care fellows, a little inclined to brag
(as is customary with all men belonging to
nations of recent civilisation) and good sol-
diers in a tight corner, I haven’t a doubt.
The Guards officer makes an amusing study
in contrast. He is fair, sleek, rather bald,
wears a monocle, and is in other respects
perfectly turned out. I wondered at first
how he would sort with the Australians, but
in spite of his superficial manner he is
neither a snob nor a mere dandy. Best of
all, he has an excellent sense of humor.
They get along famously, and before the end
of the week the Guardsman will be the most
popular man here.” This little volume, dedi-
cated “To ‘Johnny,’ who , sang in all
weathers,” is the simple, starkly truthful
diary of one who served “somewhere in
France.” It is not merely an objective re-
cord; it is an impress df facts and their
psychological reaction.
Currency Lass, by James Devaney (Corn-
stalk Publishing Co.). “Currency” was the
term applied in the early days of N. S.
Wales to the native-born lads and lasses to
distinguish them from the immigrant or
“sterling” section, It is round the person of
Lorna Gault, a c'urrency lass, that the love
interest of this dramatic and highly-colored
novel by an Australian writer moves. The
novel deals with crude humanity under sordid
and depressing conditions that might well
be allowed to drift from memory. Since the
convict days many years of fine pioneering
and urban life have passed that provide a
healthier source from which to draw inspira-
tions. Apart from this aspect, the author
lias succeeded in painting a vivid picture
that is not wholly confined to the penal settle-
ment, but takes the reader into bush and
mountains as yet without settlers’ habita-
tions.

Young Again.
Since morn is here with far-flung light
And seabirds on the wing,
Bet us east eyes aside awhile
And go a-pleasuring;
Ashore on such a golden day
A shame it were to bide,
Wherefore let us a-rowing go
Upon the dancing tide.
Boys once again, men back again
In youth’s all-radiant clime,
ith dripping blades and flashing blades,
Forgetful of grey Time,
Where oft of old we met the waves
( With cleaving keel and bow,
By beach and bay, by reef and isle,
Let us go faring now.
Blue waters rippling round about,
Above us skies of blue,
Since Nature’s young and beauty’s young
Let us be youngsters, too ;
High shores to starboard, shores to port,
Soft winds and waves at play—
A pity ’twere to think of age
On such a new-born day!
As we go rowing mile on mile
With oars that rise and fall,
Faint, faint and far the town shall grow,
Faint, faint and far its call;
As soft behind us streels our wake,
Pearl-white and like to lace,
We shall not hear its call to toil
Nor see its market-place.
Glad youngsters on yon beach at play,
Yon seabirds on the wing—
Shall they alone know joy-of-life,
Alone go pleasuring?
Who would be young years may not stay.
Nor Time as captives hold ;
Wherefore a-pleasuring we’ll go
As oft we went of old.
Since morn is here with radiant skies
And golden light far-flung,
And youth seems lord of all that is,
Let us be also young;
With dipping blades and dripping blades,
As in bright years agone.
Age left behind, care left behind,
Let us row on and on !

Evening Light.
This is the hour of evening where we come
Between the sunshine and the solem
stars;
When flowers are closed and birds are flying-
home,
And, like a golden lily in a vase,
Day droops on the jade edges of the sky—
The hour of sleep is nigh.
A quiet wind is stirring in the trees,
Soon to be silent, and the birds are still.
And silenqe comes upon the shore and seas.
And in the valley and along the hill;
And, like a child upon a loving breast,
Barth nestles down to rest.
This is the hour of evening, when the toil
Of day is done with, and the weary song
Of labor’s ended, and the stubborn soil
That we have striven with the whole day
long
Yields now, and takes us in a soft caress,
And give us quietness.

Renunciation.
Burn low, burn low in the grate,
Red fire that jewelled the dusk!
The night has grown still and late,
Dream-laden and sweet with musk,
Deep laden with dewy musk.
Fall coals, that have glowed so red,
Part silently, one by one,
Till your ashes are grey and dead!
And I wait for the dawn alone ;
With the shadow of fear, alone.
I would I might keep you near
Till the white dawn blanches the sky,
But her light would ihock at your cheer.
’Twere better that you should die,
That the flame in your heart should die.
Burn dreams, burn low in my heart,
Wild dreams that were like the flame!
’Tis written that we must part
In sorrow which none may name,
Which never may bear a name.
Fall dreams, fall softly away
From the heart which kindled your fire,
In the dusk of that yesterday
When life was a dim desire,
A passionate, young desire!
’Twere better to leave me so
In the velvety dark of the night
But how shall I bear to know
Your ghosts in the chill dawn light, •
Grey ghosts in the cruel light?
Hope shall be gone, and faith,
In the pitiless dawn of day.
All save a dream—fire’s wraith—
A handful of ashes grey,
Dead ashes, to cast away.

How Shall I Sing Her Praise?
When of your love I sing, old friend,
Swift is my praise: the words are good:
Her hair is red as cedarwood ;
She has such royal blue eyes, they send
Rebuke against the morning star;
Her smooth voice from her throat runs
low;
Her hands are eloquent, as though
They spoke or sang, so deft they are!
lliere needs but thought of her, praise slips
Drawn simply as my breath from me,
For graven on my mind I see
Hie profile of her scarlet lips,
Her head’s bronze panoply of hair.
Such stuff of poetry she is,
AH songs of old that earned their kiss
I cannot help but sing of her,
For Sheba in her pride is she—
From Ind or Spain or lost Peru
No queen of old romances knew
Such pomps as her simplicity.
But when I think of mine own love
The tide of my fraught mind runs full,
And only things unspeakable
Mock the dumb words they cannot move.
There are quick impulses to song,
And quickly gone; and all perplexed
_ And all unsure I am, and vexed
To praise her with my stumbling tongue.
She is so strange—l do not know....
She does not do the things she should;
She’s neither very fair nor good;
Me, have not kissed as lovers do;
She’ll say such silly things at times,
And then she’s cropped her wealth of
hair! .
Sweet madcap! She could never wear
A coronet of royal rhymes!
And all her wayward beauty lies
In unpraised moments wdien she stands
Beside me—movements of her hands:
The honor of her friendly eyes :
Ridiculous and deathless things
That are so dear to love! And yet
The very hours that none forget
Are those the poet never sings.
The scarlet passions that destroy
And those immortal moons of yore
Went hand in hand with love before;
But she is like a charming boy,
Brown-handed, full of idle talk.
She mocks the metaphors of love;
In her is less of flower and dove
Than windy hill and roving hawk.
And yet the challenge of the past
Was in those singers who extolled
Ihe golden, deathless girls of old;
And Love forbid mine should be lost!
I snail not rest through all my days
Until the modern world haS heard
_ The glory of some living word
To be remembered in her praise.

The Pipers.
o fairy pipers dancing down
The glen of ghosts to goblin town,
By haunted paths of moon and dew—
God’s benison be over you!
Or long ago or yesterday
I loved your music clear and gay;
Or yesterday or long ago—
Wist ye the tunes I used to know?
Mow am I come, by Vision’s grace,
Back to my boyhood’s trysting-place:
The hills are here, the leaf-dim sky—
But where is he that once was I?
What dream is this? Time’s gate unbars
See, ’twixt the bracken and the stars,
And past the forest’s fluted piers,
Rise up the dim, forgotten years!
Wraith galleons of a ghostly sea,
They glimmer on and cease to be ;
To-morrow’s ships may come to ’shore,
But these are lost for evermore!
O pipers, shall we only find
Lost ships on lonely seas and blind,
And fairy echoes far away,
If W T e go seeking yesterday?
I know not! Yet perchance ’tis well
To-morrow’s music none may tell.
Nor what strange dream may wait With-
drawn
In the gold labyrinth of dawn.
Ah yet the child that once was I
Goes sadly ’neath the moonwhite sky,
Because of pipes that used to blow
The fairy tunes of long ago !

My baby dances like a fleck of foam,
Wind-eddied from the margin of some sea •
Or slender, flickering flame that, elfin-lit,
Hovers upon some fairy-haunted lea.
Wee shining feet that barely kiss the earth
blip deftly into any dainty measure •
And every. eager little fluttering limb ’
Thrills in a quickening ecstasy of pleasure.

One with the whirling yellow leaves she’s
flown,
Lured by a moonbeam elf to play apart;
Yet often in my loneliness I feel
Her little dancing feet upon my heart

Mr. Maurice Moscovitch, a famous actor, writes:—“Wherever
I go I always take a supply of Rexona •Shaving Soap with
me. I wouldn't he without it for worlds —it is par excellence
for the skin.”
Mr. Georye
Edwards, a
popular com-
edian writes:
“In Rexona l
have at last
found a Shav-
ing Soap that
will retain the
full lather for
a consider-
able period. I
shall rn os t
certainly con-
tinue to use,
same, as I
find it most
c o nv e nient
and pleas-
nnt.”
£
Here is a new idea in Shaving Soap—another
Rexona triumph —one this time which will be
appreciated by men wherever beards grow.
Rexona Shaving Soap contains the same Oils
and Essences which have made Rexona famous
the world over, and is made on the Rexona
formula, and thus makes a Shaving Stick which
is a soap and lotion combined. It makes for
comfort and hypiene in shaving, and tempers the
skin against wind and bad weather.
REXONA SHAVING STICK (Medicated) is
Rexona Soap specially treated so as to produce a
thick creamy lather, which will soften the beard
and improve the skin at the same time. It is
delicately perfumed and medicated on the same
principle as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and not
only produces a lasting lather, but purifies and
leaves the skin in perfect condition. Being an
antiseptic Medicated Soap, it has a tendency to
quickly heal any cut you may have the misfortune
to get, and, if troubled with pimples or blotches
of any kind, will daily tend to remove them.
Rexona Shaving Soap, the New Triangular
Stick, is sold in pure aluminium containers at 1/6.

STARVED AUSTRALIAN DEFENCES.
In 1913-14, according to the “Official Year
Book,” the revenue of the Commonwealth,
excluding the receipts from business under-
takings, amounted to £17,207,000, and
£4,752,000 was spent on Defence. Last year,
according to the Page Budget, the revenue
reached £51,300,000 and the Defence expen-
diture totalled £5,836,000. Included in this
sum, besides £996,000 “for developmental
programme,” were interest, £237,800; sink-
ing fund, £26,780; contributions under
Superannuation Act, £12,500; pensions and
retiring allowances, £2600; and “legal costs
ownership Garden Island,” £563. On the
military forces, as distinct from the naval
and air forces, £2,356,000 was spent in 1913-
14 and £1,526,000 in 1926-27. These amounts
were given in a return laid on the table
of the House of Reps, by Marr, the Mini-
ster for Home and Territories. The
£1.526,000 expended last year was £474.000
less than the grants distributed among the
States for so-called Federal-aid roads, which
have no military objective, being wholly
political. In fact, there was money to
burn for everything except the defence of
the continent. Defence is the one depart-
ment of the Commonwealth in which there
has been drastic economy. Yet it is the
one department in which drastic economy
is dangerous and might be fatal if war came.
And the less prepared tve are the more
likely is it to come.

On the naval side, it is true, something
is being done. Barring accidents, the two
10.000-ton cruisers and the two ocean-going
submarines decided upon in 1925 will be
in commission before long, and the sea-
plane-carrier will be finished some day,
Jock Garden permitting. Britain’s aban-
donment of the Two-Power standard makes
further additions to the R.A.N. necessary,
but the indications are that there will
be a fair chance of getting them, especially
if the Government hits upon the notion of
building light cruisers and submarines in
some part of Australia where Jock Gardens
can’t interfere and the Trades and Labor
Council, if any, does not communicate with
Moscow or Canton. The Air Force also
has friends in Parliament. Certainly a
mere £687,000 (accepting Marr’s figures),
was spent on it last year, besides £111,700
in aid of civil aviation, but the votes for
air services are annually increasing, and
there is a disposition to increase them still
more. It is the military forces that are
being starved. Inspector-General Chauvel
makes this clear in every report he writes,
but his reports are ignored. Reduced hours,
raised wages, dearer freight rates and fares
and other factors have added greatly to the
price of everything the army has to buy
(and A.I.F. stocks of material are pretty
well exhausted), while there is a consider-
able annual increase in the number of
young men available for training. But
“instead of a corresponding increase in the
annual amount voted by Parliament,”
there have been “progressive annual reduc-
tions.”
* * * *
Australia, as the Inspector-General points
out, is supposed to possess the nucleus of
“an organisation of five military divisions
and two cavalry divisions,” together with
non-divisional troops and auxiliary services,
all properly trained and equipped. This
was the scheme decided upon when the
Government had a rush of “economy” to
the head. But, according to the man who
commanded the Desert Mounted Column,
the nucleus falls short of requirements in
training and equipment, as well as in
numbers. So far from the rudimentary
organisation producing its own leaders, as
was intended, there is already a shortage
of non-coms, and junior leaders, and the
supply of officers shows signs of failing.
Staff corps, instructional corps, garrison
artillery and other branches of the service
are all suffering owing to the chronic lack
of pence and uncertainty as to the future,
and “the position with regard to the muni-
tions developmental programme is far from
satisfactory,” though the Munitions Supply
Board reports that “a number of rifles were
produced” at the small-arms factory last
year. General Chauvel states further that
“25 per cent, of our horses are from 16
to 21 years old.” “The needs of the field
artillery are so great,” and so little atten-
tion has been paid to the Inspector-
General’s requests for replacements and his
remarks on the state of the horse-breeding
industry, that “in all the depots there are
now very few horses suitable for officers
to ride.” For these reasons, among others,
“the training of units was seriously ham-
pered last year”; in Westralia there were
“insufficient suitable horses to mount one
battery at a time.” Above all, although
the population has reached 6,122,000 and
it is estimated that 160,000 youths are
liable, only 42,000 are under training in
the Citizen Forces. Scores of thousands of
country lads who ought to be the back-
bone of a great mounted infantry, the
brothers and cousins and neighbors of the
stout fellows who drove the Turks out of
Beersheba and broke them, are excluded
from the “universal” and “compulsory”
training scheme. It is a perilous state of
affairs, but it gets no attention in Par-
liament, though a great fuss is made there
over matters like the sale of a few insolvent
and job-controlled Government steamers and
the Federal-aid roads and the Federal loans
for suburban residences. The party in
office professes to stand for a numerous
and efficient citizen army, but it is afraid
to take the necessary measures lest it
alienate votes. The party in opposition
believes that the country can be defended
on the cheap, by means of aircraft and
submarines, if the brotherly-love business
fails. And between the two the army
perishes.
WHY DISEASES GO UNCHECKED.
Responsibility for public health rests
heavily upon the nation. It is the duty of
the organised intelligence of the State to
preserve its people; and to prevent the
spread of disease should be the first task of
government and of collective civic endeav-
or, instead of being regarded as a com-
paratively unimportant function in the
hands of a minor department. Many coun-
tries, and particularly this Commonwealth,
maintain against diseases from without an
elaborate quarantine, in which no cost is
counted in days of acute peril; but what of
internal quarantine against scourges and
plagues whose ruinous incidence is only too
well known?
Education of the community is specially
necessary to restrict the spread of venereal
disease, which devastates mankind dread-
fully, yet can be immeasurably lessened in
its wastage by simple and systematic means
of extending public knowledge. In Aus-
tralian States and in Maoriland there
are V.D. laws, valuable in their intention,
though their value in actual working can be
less confidently asserted. The central point
of them all is a provision that cases of
venereal should be reported to a public
health authority, like any other disease
which is specially dangerous because com-
municable; yet, in spite of such laws, ven-
ereal disease is not as closely watched as
measles, nor are its contagions as carefully
guarded against. The law can move no
faster than the intelligence of the people,
and the prime necessity is therefore the
awakening of public opinion. Public educa-
tion and disease prevention go together.
It is not necessary to pile up the evi-
dence which shows how deeply venereal dis-
ease has affected public health, not in Aus-
tralasia only, but in every country in the
world. Everywhere the evidence is the
same. The British Royal Commission which
reported in 1916 discovered startling facts
concerning syphilis among ordinary patients
of general hospitals. At the London Hos-
pital, of 1002 adult patients who presented
themselves—for reasons wholly unconnected
with syphilis—those whose blood gave the
positive reaction betraying syphilis were 10.3
per cent, among the men and 5.1 per cent,
among the women. Sir John Collie found
the positive reaction in 9.36 per cent, of
500 persons apparently uninfected; and in
127 men who had served in the army or
navy the syphilitic reaction was found in
18.89 per cent.
Statistics which have been adopted as a
standard of Australian evidence were col-
lected for the Eighth Session of the Aus-
tralasian Medical Congress in Melbourne in
1908. Dr. P. B. Bennie, having conducted
examinations of children offered for hospital
treatment in Melbourne, told the Congress:
“Fully 25 per cent, of the sick children in
Melbourne are tainted with syphilis, and
about 10 per cent, of the total number of
children in Melbourne are syphilised....
nearly half the children who die are infected
with syphilis.” This evidence, given after
research, is startling, but it was accepted
and repeated by the Commonwealth Com-
mittee in a report on venereal diseases in
1916.
Medical men agree on three propositions:
(1) That venereal disease does take from
the populace a tremendous toll of death, of
sickness, of sterility and of infant mortality,
and of physical and mental defect among
children.
(2) That the cure of either syphilis or
gonorrhoea in early stages can be confidently
undertaken.
(3) That intelligent prophylaxis is a
powerful preventive against the spread of
venereal disease.
With these three propositions admitted
—and each of them is beyond challenge—
a fourth proposition, or conclusion, neces-
sarily follows, and it can be stated in two
words: Public Education. Educated in
knowledge of the dangers of a neglected
ailment, educated in sex matters to avoid
the promiscuity which is chiefly responsible
for venereal contagion, educated to shun
the secret quacks who live not by the ex-
tinction but by the spread of venereal
organisms, the public must at length pro-
vide their own prevention, and hasten their
own cure. Then, and then only, will there
be a chance to cease the special race
suicide which communities commit when
they carelessly give latitude to diseases
which maim and kill, not in their own
generation only, but from one generation
to another.
It was the view of Dr. Clubbe, in evi-
dence given to the committee of 1916, that
every year about 500 children admitted to
the Children’s Hospital in Sydney were
suffering from gonorrhoea. The British
Royal Commission took evidence concern-
ing 34 syphilitic mothers, who in 175 births
gave the world only 30 apparently healthy
babies; of the total number 104 were still-
born or'died, and 41 were seriously diseased.
In London blind schools the parental
records of 1100 children were traced; and
31.2 per cent, of cases were certainly, and
an additional 2.8 per cent, probably, due
to syphilis. “Speaking generally,” said Dr.
P. B. Bennie to the British Commission,
“the chances of dying before puberty are,
for the syphilitic, seven times greater than
for the non-syphilitic.” And the murderous
paradox of the matter is that (to quote
Surgeon-Commander T. B. Shaw) “medi-
cally these diseases are essentially prevent-
able.” “An educational movement,” said
the Commonwealth Committee of 1916, “is
of the highest importance. Every boy at
a certain age should be taught the lesson
of clean living and continence.”
Such facts and recommendations as have
been set out contain, when taken together,
an urgent appeal for some organised attempt
to offer knowledge to the public, so that
the community may expect the education
of youth in sex matters. The price of
ignorance is appalling. The tragic story of
the few medical statistics quoted above
could be repeated in a hundred other sets
of figures, always renewing the same dread-
ful tale of the sacrifice of the race to the
twin Molochs of ignorance and neglect.
MACQUARIE STREET.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Where Canada Is Beating Us.
Some skimpy but suggestive “Comparisons
with Other Dominions" have been published
by Commonwealth-Treasurer Earle Page
among his Budget papers. One, dealing
with the external trade of Australia and
Canada, is very striking, though it seems
to have been overlooked by the Gulletts
and Theodores who have been pulling the
Budget to pieces. In 1925-26 Australia
imported goods valued at £151,638,000 and
exported goods valued at £148,562,000, leav-
ing a balance on the wrong side of £3,076,000
(it reached £31,683,000, exclusive of move-
ments of bullion, last year). Canada in
1925-26 imported goods valued at
£202,425,000 and exported goods valued at
£268,911,000, leaving a balance on the right
side of £66,486,000. That is as far as the
Treasurer goes; but the story ought to be
continued.
Among the principal Canadian exports in
1925-26 were cheese (33,718,587 dollars, or
£6,926,000), bacon and hams (£5,875,000),
flax seed (£2,647,000), iron and manufac-
tures of iron (£15,360,000), vehicles
(£8,874,000) and rubber and manufactures of
rubber (£4,260,000). Australia produces most
of these commodities, and could produce
them all, but it imports them on a huge
scale, particularly manufactures of iron and
rubber. Further, the balance of trade being
so substantially in its favor, Canada
isn’t obliged to borrow vastly to meet
“commitments in London,” after the
Australian fashion. Mainly for that
reason its public debt is very much
smaller than Australia’s. Certainly the
Canadian Dominion owed £577,000,000 on
January 31 and the net Commonwealth
debt on June 30 was returned at £341,000,000
(£94,500,000 borrowed on behalf of the
States was excluded), but Canada’s popu-
lation exceeds 9i millions, whereas ours
hasn’t reached millions. Then the
Canadian provincial debts are negligible
compared with those of the Australian
States. For example, Quebec (population,
about 2,500,000) owed £11,580,000 on June
30, 1926, when N. S. Wales (pop., 2.300,000)
owed £223,504,000. Nova Scotia, with about
the same population as South Australia
(550,000), owed £7,390,000 when S. Aus.
owed £81,473,000. Manitoba, with 135,000
fewer inhabitants than Queensland’s 875,000,
had a debt of £14,900,000 as against Queens-
land’s £102,316,000. New Brunswick (pop.,
400,000) paid interest on £5,460,000; West-
ralia (pop., 375,000) had to find interest on
£70,806,000.
Loan works “to absorb the unemployed”
are part and parcel of the Australian
system; and the unemployed army grows
larger every year. If our exports exceeded
■our imports in the Canadian proportion
loans and non-absorbent works would be
alike unnecessary. We must strive to
secure a trade balance as favorable as
Canada’s. To do it we will have to produce
more and import less. Greater production
of articles which are unnecessarily brought
here from the ends of the earth, combined
with systematic purchasing of Australian
goods whenever Australian goods are avail-
able, should be —must be—the national
policy. Along the road we are now taking
bankruptcy lies. If we don’t turn aside it
is inescapable.

Earle Page and the Pack.
Small and medium dogs of all colors
yapped at Federal-Treasurer Page when the
Reps, went into Committee of Supply,
and barked that his finances were rotten for
many reasons, all of them different and
many of them contradictory. Charlton
moved a vote of censure on the ground of
the adverse trade balance, the increase of
unemployment and the insufficiency of the
Protection afforded. He wanted Bruce-
Page to charge higher duties. His lieutenant,
Theodore, followed with a terrific growl to
the effect that “indirect taxation had be-
come a crushing burden on the community;
there was no justification for the Customs
revenue that the Government was raising.”
He wanted Bruce-Page to charge lower
duties. He also complained that the Gov-
ernment is reducing direct taxes by
£6,500,000 a year to partly meet the clamor
about the duplication of State and Federal
taxes. A crowd of other incoherent dogs
followed, some yelping that the Treasurer
should increase production so that Australia
would import less, and some that he should
reduce duties in the hope that it would
import more. An offside dog held that he
should help production by reducing wages.
Page is no wonderful financier, but it is
due to him to remember that Australia is
a muddle which has no exact parallel on
earth, and a Colbert or a Gladstone would
find himself up against it. The Common-
wealth has no power, despite the Loan
Council, to prevent the States borrowing
abroad all they can get. When they borrow
much, imports go up with a whoop, and
the Customs revenue also goes up. But
when a financial panic reduces the foreign
loans to a minimum, imports and Customs
revenue will go down with a sudden crash,
and the Treasurer can’t cut, down duties
simply because the crash isn’t here to-day.
though it is expected to-morrow. The
tariff should help production much more
than it does, and diminish both imports and
Customs revenue. But, then, the country
has a unique collection of apparatus for
putting up wages, reducing hours and pro-
duction, organising strikes and stoppages,
and restricting apprenticeship to keep down


the supply of skilled workers. No tariff
will make the factory turn out more if the
lactory is stopped.
The Growth of Wireless.
One of many sensible things said by the
Wireless Commission in its report to the
Commonwealth Government was that great
care must be taken not to hamper the de-
velopment of radio or to create powerful
vested interests. At the present time the
basic principles of wireless telegraphy ana
telephony are the subject of patents. In
Australia practically all the patents that,
matter (and a lot that don’t) are controlled
by Amalgamated Wireless (Australia), Ltd.,
a company in which, for reasons of State,
the Commonwealth Government has
acquired a majority of the shares. The com-
pany has, in the opinion of the Commission,
made very liberal use of its opportunities
as a monopolist. The toll taken on six
A-class broadcasting stations last year was
£31,997, or 58 per cent, per annum on the
capital value of the transmitting plant
employed.
Evidently it was felt by the directors of
Amalgamated Wireless and its principal
shareholder that the company had been
making things a bit too, hot. So now there
are to be no more royalty payments for
five years—listeners, by the way, were
charged ss. a year on their license and
12s. 6d. on each valve they bought—and the
listeners’ license fees are to be reduced by
3s. 6d. The Commonwealth Government,
for some unexplained reason, will pay to
the company 3s. in respect of each annual
license fee collected by the Postal Depart-
ment. And the charges of the company are
to be under Commonwealth control. It isn’t
as much as might have been done to free
the ether from commercial exploitation, but
Priminister Bruce balks at the idea of com-
plete Government control, and with so many
horrible examples of what hapoens to Gov-
ernment-controlled services all around him
he can scarcely be blamed.
But the whole position in regard to wire-
less, all the world over and not only in
Australia, is obscure, dubious and unsatis-
factory. Radio is at present most import-
antly a toy, prostituted to the base uses of
vaudeville and the sentimental ballad; but
that shouldn’t be allowed to overshadow
the fact that it is a means of communica-
tion that threatens to oust every other. The
inventors of the various clever appliances
used have a right to their reward, but it
isn’t a right in perpetuity, and in the future
it is going to become increasingly difficult
for any corporation or Government to
attempt to control the use of the ether.
Politicians ought to keep that in mind when
legislating on the subject, but up to the
present time there is very little evidence
that they have considered the future at all.
:—«
What is Wrong with the Coal Industry.
Booth, M.L.A., advises the coalmining
employees in the Northern district of
N. S. Wales to prepare for a lean time, as
strikes are certain. With Aberdare South
shut down indefinitely and Abermain No. 1
giving notice to its miners, things are cer-
tainly looking black. Sooner or later the
fight must come as to who is to run the
industry. At present it is not being run by
anyone; it is simply drifting.
A big proportion of the men employed
would like a cleaning-up; but one of the
drawbacks of a strong organisation such as
the C.E.F. is that it is led by enthusiasts
who take short views, and an industry which
depends upon contracts made as much as
18 months in advance must go to pieces
unless all concerned can see further than
to-morrow. To fight for better conditions
and better wages will probably always be
necessary for the employee, but if this
means that whenever an employer en-
deavors to get a fair amount of efficiency
a determined effort to protect the slacker
is made, disaster is certain. The rebel can’t
have it both ways; if he wants the industry
to be prosperous he should help to make it
prosperous.
The root trouble on the Northern field is
that the C.E.F. has made up its mind that
200 days a year is the economic limit for
the men, and, being persuaded of that,
they determine to choose their own time
when work shall be done. Further, in
their desire to hit the fat man they find
out when contracts are being filled, and
choose that as the right time to stop the
wheels. The obvious thing happens; the
owners allow for a 200-day year and will
not take the risk of contracting to supply
more coal than can be produced in that
time. So 'when the men want to work there
isn’t always work for them; and pretty
often when the owners want them to work
they won’t.
In plain English, the industry is suffer-
ing from stupidity and swelled head. And
the tragedy is that, as a rule, those who
ought to say so are afraid to do it, with the
result that* thousands of innocent people
suffer.
#
The Cuckoo in the Nest.
There are the elements of trouble in the
news that an American engineering syndi-
cate has secured the right to construct a
dam across the exit of the Blue Nile from
Lake Tsana in Abyssinia.
The Blue Nile, which junctions with the
White Nile just below Khartoum, is one of
the two essential rivers whose union in the
Nile spells existence to Egypt. More than
that, it is absolutely necessary to the fruition
of the vast scheme of irrigated cotton-
growing which Britain has instituted in the
Gezireh, that huge triangle which lies where
the two rivers meet, in the Soudan. A dam
has already been constructed by the British
administrators of the Soudan at Sennar, but
another across the exit of the Blue
Nile from Lake Tsana is imperatively
necessary. This was proposed to the Regent
of Abyssinia by the British Government,
and, though final negotiations had not been
settled, it was understood that the right
would be granted to Britain, the French and
Italian Governments, both having interests
in Abyssinian affairs, consenting.
The sudden intrusion of the American
syndicate has some peculiar aspects.
America has hitherto taken little interest
in the affairs of Abyssinia, internal or
external; but that an American firm should
be declared to have obtained permission to
conserve the Tsana waters is not surprising
to anyone familiar with American “big
business” methods and the notorious ven-
ality of the Abyssinians. What is really
interesting is the statement that the
American syndicate, if successful, intends,
not only to conserve the Blue Nile water,
but to sell it. This means that it intends
to levy on the Soudan and Egyptian
Governments for water supplies which are
essential to the growing of their great
and increasing crops of cotton. Egypt has
already hit the American
hard with its great output of cheaply-pro-
duced cotton. The great areas of the
Gezireh, worked by Soudanese peasant-
farmers on a share system, promise to cut
even more deeply into what was once an
American monopoly. The control of the
water supply to Egypt and the Gezireh
would do much to resuscitate the old-time
American cotton monopoly. With an
American control of the Blue Nile sources,
that consummation would seem to be in
sight.
That the protest of the British, Egyp-
tian and Soudanese Governments against
the reported concession will be emphatic
there can be no doubt. Indeed, it is not
too much to say that the American acquisi-
tion of the right to build this dam will not
be permitted. That attitude taken, any-
thing may follow.

Laughter in Hell.
Somebody must have grinned in Gehenna
when the German Chancellor, Dr. Marx,
and his Foreign Minister, Dr. Stresemann,
visited Vienna and condoled with the re-
maining fragment of the Austrian Empire
on their mutual misfortunes.
Many will agree with the Austrian Chan-
cellor, Dr. Siepel, when he said, at a ban-
quet given to the honored guests, that
there could be no real advance in the cul-
ture of Europe till mutual trust became the
foundation of European policy. That
aspiration has been voiced for a very long
time, but has never become a concrete fact.
No one should better know why than the
speaker and his guests, once members of
an offensive and defensive alliance that
had all the rest of Europe standing to arms
for many years. In much the same vein,
and with much the same implication attach-
ing to it, was Dr. Marx’s reply that the
feeling of sympathy and understanding
between Germany and Austria remained
unaltered, and that there was nothing to
divide their hearts or mar their friendship.
In the same manner might two footpads
who had attempted to rob a Scotsman of
his last eighteen pence condole together as
they licked their wounds after their in-
tended victim had left them battered on
the field.
The world has some sympathy for
Austria, egged into ruin by her braggart
ally. But there is little of that cheap com-
modity for Germany, without whose
urging the unhappy ultimatum to Serbia
would never have been delivered in
the face of all the insistent pleadings of
the remainder of Europe. In the outcome
both lost all they had staked. Germany had
her wings clipped for the time, but was
left plenty of opportunity to grow new 7
pinions. The Austrian Empire that was,
though infinitely the less guilty of the two
parties, has been reduced to the status of
one of its former provinces, with no power
to emerge from the morass of its difficul-
ties. The spectacle of the author of Aus-
tria’s ruin condoling with its hopelessly
broken catspaw in the wrecked city of
Vienna, that was once one of the world’s
proudest capitals, and declaring that the
past had divided no hearts and marred no
friendship, is one to make angels weep
and devils do the other thing.

An Economist Looks at Arbitration.
The agitation in Maoriland for the repeal
of the Arbitration Act has had its impetus
mostly from the Farmers’ Union and a
section of the Employers’ Federation; but
now another champion has entered the
field—A. H. Tocker, who holds the chair
of Economics at Canterbury College. The
most important point he makes is that
compulsory arbitration has not benefited
the wage-earners. Whereas the wage
standard in M.L. has been stationary since
1900, those of Canada and U.S. have risen
25 per cent, since 1914. Out of 400,000 wage-
earners, only 100,000 come within the ambit
of the Arbitration Court, and, according to
this observer, the indirect effect of such
awards as are made is much greater than
the direct effect —the indirect effect being to
depress the purchasing power of wages
bv raising the cost of living. Also; as The
Bulletin has pointed out a hundred times,
the Arbitration Court has taken a line it
was never intended to take, by basing
wages on the fallacious standard of the
cost of living.
Tocker’ s indictment of the effects of
compulsory arbitration as the system has
been developed in Maoriland and Australia
is reasonable enough; but in justice to the
pioneers of compulsory arbitration —
Charles Kingston, of South Australia, and
Pember Reeves, of Maoriland —it has to be
said that they were not responsible for any
of those bad effects. Reeves wanted all
labor unionised and amenable to arbitra-
tion; his original Act in its preamble set
forth that its object was to “foster and
encourage the formation of industrial
unions,” and had he been able to carry his
colleagues with him the Act would have
made unionism as well as arbitration com-
pulsory. What Tocker attacks is really an
optional compulsion to which has been
grafted an attempt to maintain the standard
of living irrespective of earning capacity.
Tocker asserts that there is no need for
the Court in these days as an antidote to
sweating. But at the time the M.L. Court
was instituted the whole country was
shocked with evidence regarding most palp-
able and outrageous sweating—the prime
cause of the victory of the Radical Bal-
lance in 1890—and there certainly is a good
deal of sweating in countries that have no
State system of settling industrial disputes.
Anyway, to suddenly abolish arbitration is
politically inexpedient. The best thing to
be done is to try to reform the system by
deleting its most obvious defects. Maori-
land is attempting to do that, and Australia
will have the results of the experiment at
its disposal.
But before there can be hope of much
success in the way of reform, there
must be a great deal of educating;
and that presents large difficulties be-
cause it is not so much learning that
has to be done as unlearning. The idea
has got deeply rooted that anything is
possible in a democracy—that anything we
should like to see done can be done. Of
course it is quite wrong. We can no
more make it possible to pay a man so
much per week, and allow his widow so
much, by merely passing a law about it
than we can make every man, woman and
child undrownable. Natural laws will pre-
vail though every Parliament in the world
thunder against them.

Betting on the Nod.
The latest report of .the Queensland
Auditor-General on State enterprises sug-
gests that the enterprises are of the sort
on which angels don’t risk their haloes.
It deals not with the accepted State
enterprises in which all the Australian States
and the Commonwealth have consented to
embark—railways are a typical example—
but with those peculiar incursions into the
commercial activities of the northern State
which include pastoral, butchering, fishing,
canning and one or two other experiments
which have, in less prodigal times, been
left to private industry, it being then
thoroughly understood that if private indus-
try made a mess of them it had to pay the
piper.
The modern State, with everybody’s
money to blow and everybody’s vote to
buy, has few qualms about taking a chance.
At the last balance the seven State enter-
prises were indebted to the Treasury for
£1.703,513. Adding to this the large amounts
written off—stations £674,789, cannery
£89,959, fish supply £44,480, less profits from
butchers’ shops £5OOO and from railway
refreshment-rooms £57,361 a sum of
£2,449,980 stands as the “net investment of
Treasury funds” on June 30 last. The capi-
tal cost of each carefree enterprise was, of
course, treated as a loan from the Treasury.
Altogether the Auditor-General estimates
the net accumulated losses on the enter-
prises to date as £1,063,185.
The State cattle-stations, after paying the
Treasury £85,007 in 1925-26 for interest and
redemption of loans, showed a loss on the
year’s trading of £152,545. For 1926-27 the
payment to the Treasury was £88,060, and
the loss £285,486. These stations have
proved practically unsaleable at decent
prices, and have been hawked by the Gov-
ernment for some time—a few have been
got rid of at a heavy discount. Com-
pulsory high wages, special taxation and
ruinous railway freights _ bring the cost of
producing a pound of beef-steak to a figure so
close to that which the consumer is willing to
nay for it that there is little, if any, profit to
the producer. Even freed of most of these
handicaps, the State has made a catastrophe
of its essay in beef-production. Yet it has
thus far shown no signs of lifting the bur-
dens laid on the private producer.

High Fares and Freights.
Dear Bulletin,— Unlike “Far North” (B.
10/11/’27), I live and work among the men
who are responsible for the high fares and
freights. And I see armies of people who
are paid big salaries to watch other people
work. I see motor-cars swooping down on
trains and trams in approved wild-west
fashion; ticket examiners, uniformed and
plain-clothed; starters, sub-inspectors and
inspectors, ad inf. At almost every street
corner in this city of Sydney I see pound-
a-day men acting as starters, though the
police direct the traffic and a driver of a
tram dare not go till the conductor gives
the signal. I see bodies of men playing
cards in working hours —and that is mainly
through bad time-tables.
If you have a minute to spare, take a
trip with a report. A conductor, say, for-
gets” to ring a bundy on a wet day. An
inspector or sub. makes a tour and collects
the bundy records, which go on to head
office, where a clerk dissects the roll and
finds the discrepancy. He forwards a note
to the depot master concerned, who sends
it on to a junior clerk, who types in the
blanks and sends it to the delinquent, who
answers the note in the usual manner it
was “an oversight.” Now the note goes
back to the depot master, who forwards it
to head office, where a clerk peruses it and
passes it to a senior clerk, who endorses it:
“Avoid repetition.” Then the note comes
back to the man who “forgot” to ring the
bundy, and eventually comes to rest in the
hands of the records clerk. The waste is
not funny, it is tragic.
Come for a run and I will show you big-
salaried men strewn along the road, bored
stiff trying to kill time. Of course the
men loaf when they get a chance; don’t
the officers set them a good example? The
tragedy is that all hands think they are
justified because they see only their own
side of life.
The Railways suffer in just the same way
from over-staffing, both top and bottom,
plus inadequate (as opposed to numerically
excessive) supervision.—Youfts, etc., Keg.

Crayn<ller, Job Finder.
A curious example of the union-secretary
way of looking at things was presented
recently to the Full Arbitration Court con-
sisting of the Inevitable Three. The familiar
Grayndler appeared for the A.W.U. with
the usual demand for fewer hours and
less production, the case this time being
that of the miners. In reply it was stated
that Mount Lyell couldn’t stand any fur-
ther financial burdens, and that if the
Court put more of them on, in its light-
hearted way, the industry would have to
depart. There is plenty of evidence to
support this. Every other copper-mine in
Australia has been closed down. Even the
old Wallaroo and Moonta has been wound
up and now the great Mount Morgan is in
liquidation.
In these circumstances Grayndler, of
the A.W.U., made the Court what might
be called a sporting offer: —
“Mr. Grayndler informed the Court that
he was instructed by his executive to say
that if Mount Lyell was closed owing to any
order made by the Court, his union would
see that the men were not stranded. It
would have them transferred
where they could make a living. ’
He didn’t mention the desirable or un-
desirable spot the men were to be “trans-
ferred” to, what they were to work at for
the living, how hard they would have to
work, what they would get for it, how long
the guarantee was to last, and what tangible
security was behind it. If “any order made
by the Court” led to the closure of Mount
Lyell it would necessarily close other mines
as badly or worse situated, and in that
case the other men might be in a bad way
—in as bad a way as the couple of thousand
men whom Broken Hill mines can no longer
employ. If the A.W.U. has employment
for 1000 men at its command, it might have
thought of giving it to these miners instead
of reserving it for those who might be
pushed out by a rash or misguided judg-
ment of the Court.
In any case, presumably Mr. Grayndler
knows where the jobs are; so if Mount
Lyell doesn’t close down and the jobs are
not wanted for the men there, he will
certainly either produce them for the
Broken Hill men or be branded as a worse
humbug than he has hitherto been sus-
pected of being.

Kill the Females!
The theory that the female of the species
is the cause of almost all the trouble in
this troublous world and that she is very
seldom any better than she should be
receives support from a small bit of paper
very closely printed in blue on both sides
and broadcast by The Bulletin’s old friend
William Rodier, who sends out Jus message
to the world every year. Rodier’s theory,
applied thus far chiefly to rabbits, is that if
only the males were left alive the whole
race would soon peter out. The more poly-
gamous animals are the more offspring the
females bring into the world, and the
greater the proportion of females.
The idea, as applied to humans, has been
acted upon in certain countries —China, for
example—where the population has grown
too rapidly for comfort; but it may be given
a more general application inside a century.
One of the leading Yankee anthropologists,
Prof. East, of Harvard, told a Population
Conference at Geneva a few weeks ago that
within a hundred years, at the present rate
of increase, there would be 5,000,000,000
humans on this planet, and the problem of
feeding them would be getting acute. Evi-
dently he put no faith in the figures of
Prince Kropotkin, whu reckoned, in the
light of the achievements of French market-
gardeners, that there wasn’t any need for a
food problem. The frank message of Rodier
—“Kill the females and let the males go”—
cuts athwart the discussion with a practical
recipe.
Possibly the next feminist movement will
be—but it may be more than The Bul-
letin’s life is worth to suggest what it may
be.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Dominions-Secretary Amsry has gone on
from Australia to M.L. without giving the
Commonwealth the advice it is most in need
of: “Come down to earth !”
The N.S.W. Government is going to re-
lieve Good, Old Piddo, the Industrial Com-
missioner, of some of his duties. It ought
to provide him with another. As everv man
should stew in his own juice he ought to be
appointed Receiver of Deputations of Un-
employed.
With the usual disorderly way of doing
battle, the N.S.W. Marine Transport men
(waterside workers, seamen, painters and
dockers, shipwrights, cooks, butchers, bakers
and stewards) have decided that all the ships
of any company which buys the Common-
wealth line shall be put under the greater
and lesser excommunication in Australian
waters. That suggests three alternatives: to
sell to some company which has nothing to
do with Australia ; to sell at a discount which
will attract some reckless buyer to take
chances; or to postpone the sale till the
Greek Kalends and lay the ships up indefi-
nitely. The first device is far the best, for it
would remove the bone of contention to dis-
tant parts.
Recent hold-ups included one at Fre-
mantle, where the wharf laborers demanded
that the work of re-bagging spilt wheat and
re-sewing torn bags should be taken from
the A.W.U. men and given to them at 4s. Sd.
extra per day, and one at Hobart, where it
is required that members of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation shall be kept at the
Zone Co. s private wharf instead of the co.’s
own employees handling the bit of traffic.
In each case the demand was quite new and
was founded on no award, but as it wasn’t
instantly complied -with, freight began to be
declared black” on a big scale. Talk is
also heard about a marine strike being in
preparation for Christmas. The desire to
hurt somebody or ruin somebody’s harmless
pleasure appears inseparable, in some minds,
from the Cause of Liberty.
Just as the avoo! is going out and the
wheat is coming in the Waterside Workers’
Federation has begun another “overtime
strike.” It is one more manoeuvre in a
mad campaign against Australian industry.
Permanent expulsion from the Common-
wealth Arbitration Court is the obvious
remedy; then, instead of a Federation swollen
of head and body, there would be district
waterside unions on the lines of the Sydney
coal-lumpers’. That serviceable organisation
manages its affairs so well that its members
get 3d. an hour more than the Federation
men (when those distracted persons are
working), and it hasn’t had a strike for
years.
M. F. Troy, the Westralian Minister for
Lands, expects a 35,060,000-bushel crop this
year, and early reports of the harvesting
suggest that this estimate may be exceeded.
Wdstralia is so prosperous these days that
the Secession League has given it up as a
had job. The League’s dissolution was has-
tened by a brutal landlord’s demands for his
rent.
Amid the vast financial complications of
the Abrahams case one interesting fact has
come out. It is that should an alderman or
other person desire to leave Australia and
be minus the orthodox passport he can
effect his purpose if a skipper will sign him
on pro forma as a member of the crew. This
is better than going disguised as the man
who killed Condon, or some crude make-up
of the sort.
After quieting objectors in caucus, Vic.
Premier Hogan managed to get his Income-
Tax Bill through the Leg. Assembly after
one night’s debate. It provides for raising
£2.669,000, of which £261,000 represents an
SAFETY FIRST.
“Vic. Premier Hogan had to quell an incipient rebellion in the Labor party last week owing to
the rank and file objecting that the Government’s increased income-tax proposals were not in accord
with the party’s election platform. Premier Hogan promised to rectify the matter next year; at
present the Government needed the money.”
CAPTALN HOGAN (to the rank and file): “Here, old son, put that back. It may be
worm-eaten and it may not be ours, but we can’t keep afloat without it.”
increase on last year’s rates —Id. in the £
extra on personal exertion and 2d. more on
properties and companies. In a half-hearted
way Nats, and Cockies opposed the increase,
but the rural Progs, and the Independents
responded to the Labor whistle.
When Premier Bavin had read through
11yd. of his list of the Sydney City Council’s
mysterious transactions he came to “the
action of Labor aldermen in trying to force
through the Council the purchase for £65,000
of the rights of a syndicate in connection
with the land for a civic coalmine at Douglas
Park, when the Mines Department offered
for nothing a large area close by.” Then
uprose the voice of an ex-Premier: “There
was nothing corrupt. Nothing was done.”
The inference may be that a steal isn’t a
steal unless one gets away with the goods,
and that shooting at somebody isn’t shooting
unless the person is hit—possibly not unless
he is hit in the spot intended.
N.S.W. ex-Premier Slang in his favorite
vote-hunting pose as the champion of the
son of toil:
The power ought not to be given to the Govern-
ment, the Harbor Trust, or the ferry companies to say
that men going to work should not be allowed to
smoke.
Nobody urged that men “going to work”
should not be allowed to smoke, nor men
going to strike. But it has been proposed to
prohibit uncivil politicians and others smok-
ing on harbor ferries, especially the vehicular
sort. The idea is that a spark may get to
some of the plentiful petrol leakages, and the
fire may spread, and if a big boat with 25
cars abroad is ablaze from end to end lives
very much more valuable than the uncivil
politician’s may be lost.
By 21 votes to five Vic. Uppah Cliambah
tossed out Premier Ilogan’s pet bill to
enable the Governor-in-Councii to annul
municipal directions for closing roads against
certain classes of heavy traffic for a few
weeks annually. So much fuss was made
over the tuppeny-ha’penny thing that you’d
think it was of national importance. That’s
one of Hogan's weak points so far; he can’t
get things in the right perspective.
A thousand men have been put off by the
B. H. Prop, at Newcastle; Smith and Wad-
dington, Sydney motor-body builders, are so
short of orders that the works have been
closed and 300 men are off; and the same
thing is reported from scores of other fac-
tories. Meantime manufactured goods pour
into Australia, not because Australia wants
them, or, if it did want them, because it
hasn’t the men to make them, but because
we go on borrowing abroad. “Abroad”
never sends us money; it always sends us
goods. “Loans give employment” is the
cry; and it is true—they give employment
to the foreigner.
Forty-one persons were either killed or
badly hurt in motor accidents in and around
Sydney at the week end. It is time we
altered the principle on which motor licenses
are issued. At present it is assumed that
everyone is temperamentally and otherwise
fitted to handle the dangerous weapons
called motor-cars. But even a front-rank
engineer may be quite unfit. We may not be
able to make a complete examination of the
mind of an applicant for a license; but
even one bad break might show that a driver
was quite unfit to hold a license, and two
certainly should.
The great iron and steel works at New-
castle (N.S.W.) have been struck, like other
big industries, by more workmen’s com-
pensation, more State income-tax, the short-
hours week, child endowment, and, of course,
higher coal prices and freight rates, the result
of other people being similarly struck. A
heavy increase in duties might, or might not,
have met the case, but anyhow it didn’t
arrive in time. When imported steel became
10s. to 80s. per ton cheaper than Newcastle’s
cost of production orders became few. So
over 1000 men are to be dispensed with for
a commencement.
It is not certain that the Vic. Parliamen-
tary session will end before Christmas, much
as Ministers and members are sighing for
recess. Unless Ilogan’s Government is to
earn discredit as a mere window-dressing
crowd, there are a dozen or more
measures which must be passed; if
these are not dealt with, the only
thing to do will be to adjourn until after
the holidays. Giveiji firm and tactful leader-
ship and concentration on the main things,
there is still time for useful legislation to
be put through. But not if sitting after sit-
ting is wasted on propaganda and parish-
pump bills that have not a dog’s chance —a
pet phrase of Ilogan’s.
“Bildad” : I came across this in the chapter
on “Insanity” in a new medical work:
Another symptom is morbid brain excitement,
commonly exhibited in restless motions and shout-
ings.
I heard somebody who exhibited these signs
holding forth in Parliament House the other
night, but from my place in the gallery I
failed to identify him. He also revealed
marked confusion and loss of memory on
financial topics.
To judge from their published records,
some members of the rowdy crowds which
made a disturbance in N.S.W. Parliament
House and raided the Premier’s office are
qualified for deportation as undesirable per-
sons from abroad. On the further evidence
of the curious collection, of accents a good
many of them may be. The matter should be
looked into.
Theodore of Queensland began as Trea-
surer in 1915, and ended as Premier and
Treasurer 1925. He is now the Federal
Labor party's loudest financial critic and
expects to be Treasurer —possibly Premier-
Treasurer —when his party gets into office,
so his record is interesting:

Another thing that is on the downward
track is the land revenue; and unless
Queensland can find a Ministry which knows
how to get more than 2s. worth of service
for half a crown it appears that taxes must
go up again. Some of the Auditor-General’s
figures don’t go so far back as could be
wished, yet they go far enough to be interest-
ing. In 1917-18 the interest on the public
debt was £2,454,863 §nd the revenue from
public works provided £947,277 towards
meeting this. Now the year’s interest bill
is £4,831,250, and the “loan works and
services” pay £1,975,648 of this. So the
burden on the taxpayer has risen from
£1,507,586 to £2,855,602 p.a. If Queens-
land. set a trap overnight it should catch a
better financier than Theodore before morn-
ing.
The Christmas Bulletin is to be pub-
lished on Dec. 10. At first it looked as
though the short stories were going to be the
outstanding feature ; and there certainly are
a number of very striking ones. But with
the whole thing inside two covers the draw-
ings make an unexpectedly good showing—
they are the best lot printed for many years.
Only the verse is not as good as it ought to
be. Especially is there a shortage of the
lighter type. But it is an amazing six-
penn’orth.
NOT MASTER AND MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“In the Victorian Assembly ex-Minister McPherson
expressed the opinion that Australia could prosper
only when there was harmony between master and
man. Premier Hogan: ‘Say “employer” and
“employee.” ’ The ex-Treasurer: ‘All right; the
term did not matter.’ ”
Master and man ! Now who would frame
In this free young country such words of
shame
When there are synonyms, stacks and shoals,
That Avouldn’t harrow the touchiest souls V
Master and man ! lloav the spirit squirms
At these rude, insulting old Saxon terms
Which seem in such downright style to say
That one should order, another obey!
No Avonder it makes good democrats vexed.
They’ll be talking of “gentle” and “simple”
next.
Master and man ! Now spare me days!
Was ever such an invidious phrase,
Such a base reminder of Old-World ties
Long-since outgrown ’neath these sunny
skies?
It takes you back to the servile shire
Where the yokel touches his hat to the squire.
Master and man ! One gets the pip
At thought of that sort of relationship.
Bosses and hands, if you’d not displease,
Or, better, employers and employ-ees.
D’you remember the passage in “Pickwick”
when
Mrs. Raddle turns upon Allen (Ben)
And asks, as one who resents a slur,
If the hard word “woman” is meant for her?
The point of Avhicli you can hardly miss
Any more, I think, than the strong of this:
The man who’s boss of the Cabbage State
Rising to hotly repudiate,
Applied to the sons-of-Martha clan,
Such a highly offensive noun as “man.”
Master and man ! They were fitting words
For Norman nobles and Saxon herds,
But Hogan the sense of it would convey
In a more polite, euphemistic way—
Hirers and hired ones, drones and bees,
Or say employers and employ-ees.
Look round for synonyms such as those
And you won’t be treading on anyone’s toes.
But master and man! Come, stow such chat,
It’s much too straight from the shoulder,
that!

Wildflowers Protection Act to keep the
waratah from becoming rarer. During a
recent week-end the Ivatoomba (N.S.W.)
police were busily engaged taking the names
of homing motorists whose cars were laden
with ill-gotten blooms. Then somebody
travelling in the opposite direction gave a
warning, and a couple of cars dumped their
contraband on the roadside. Most of those
following saw and interpreted the sign
aright, and did likewise. Jettisoned wara-
tahs in profusion were strewn along the

“Kwinana” : Not only were the names of
steamers cut out of telegrams and cables
by the Censor during the war (B. 3/11/’27),
but in many cases the whole text of messages
was altered when the spy-scare was at its
height; instructions were even given to
operators that all oversea cables or radios
were to be paraphrased if possible, to
obviate the possibility of dangerous code
messages going through. It was after
the 1910 Melbourne Cup that one
zealous operator, bearing this instruction in
mind, altered a message that ran, “Mel-
bourne Cup: Sasanof, Shepherd King, St.
Spasa,” to “Victorian Cup: Russian, Sheep
Emperor. Street Spasa.” He wasn’t going
to chance giving anything away to the

“J.E.”: Some Maorilanders lately got to
holts in the Sydney press about the qualities
of their noble savage. One was critical, but
others seemed to hold that it was really a
question whether Henare is the white man’s
superior or only his equal. One very stern
patriot even declared that “the Maori race
is probably the only one in the world, which
is not being brought to extinction by contact
with the white man.” As there are few, if
any, black, brown or yellow races which have
avoided contact with the white man, extra-
ordinary mortality must be taking place very
quietly and the bodies must be buried.
Henare is really a pretty fair human being,
though hardly the prize specimen which
some of his keepers represent. There are
four Maoris or half-castes in Parliament, but
as four members are allotted to the race,
being one to every 12,500 browns or partly-
browns, they can hardly help being there.
They don't arrive in competition with white
men. It is a habit, which looks progressive
and all that sort of thing, to give one a
minor portfolio in the Ministry. Henare is
said to have increased from 41,993 in 1891
to 62,751, “including all half-castes,” in 1926,
but it is officially admitted that he was a
very shy and elusive bird at the earlier cen-
sus dates. He represents nearly 5 per cent,
of the population. The white man educates
young Henare hard, and in a small, well-
peopled country Brown Brother can’t relapse
into savagery without interference. Whether
his exotic culture is superficial or goes right
through is matter for speculation.

demanded instanter, and the mess-sergeant
was despatched to another emporium to get
it. A few hours later it was available, and
bearing as it did a label familiar to every
Australian was unanimously pronounced the
right stuff. Later I told the mess-sergeant
he had better get rid of the other batch to

said. “It was the same stuff, poured into the

fairly clear that only the two men took part
in the shoot. Both used automatics and both
were killed, Cutmore on the spot and Taylor
dying 20 minutes after. How Cutmore could
have killed Taylor any deader after he had
been killed himself, even if his pistol hadn’t
jambed it is difficult for an unprejudiced
person to make out.
“A. Jack”: Broken Hill in the early days
required four breweries and 73 pubs to
moisten its clay. Now there are no breweries,
and comparatively few pubs; so sober has
the town become that the licensee of a house
which used to take £2500 weekly over the
bar pleaded the other day before the Licenses
Reduction Board to be allowed to keep on
as a provider of accommodation, and after
inspecting the books the board agreed. Still,
there are indications that malted liquor has
not entirely lost its charm. The first goods-
train over the newly-opened line from Syd-
ney brought 50 tons of beer, while the first
goods-train out had as its only through
loading, with the exception of a transferred
Government official’s furniture, two truck-
loads of empty beer-barrels.

“Fez”: N. S. Wales train-crews used to
be more casual, too (B. 17/11/'27). One
Christmas-time a few years ago I was travel-
ling on a north-western train when suddenly
it pulled up without warning in the middle
of a big stretch of plain-land. I glanced to
cither side but could see no sign of a plat-
form. Looking further, afield I saw the
driver, fireman and guard tearing like mad
across the flat. Somebody yelled “Pigs."
and the chase was reinforced by several
passengers. It was a mob of suckers, and
when each of the hunters had secured one the
party returned to the train and we resumed
progress. There was no freight paid on that
live-stock, and I heard no questions asked by
the s.m. when we arrived at our destination.

“C. Coral” : This was the account Jimmy
Susu gave me of the aircraft that came over
Torres Strait Islands last month: “You
been see them two liareflane? Them two
fella come from T.I. for go Darn along New
Guinea: he got eye underneath, all same
butterfly. I hear noise. I look round, see
nothing. Then them piccaninny sing out,
‘Look, man-o’-war [frigate] bird he come,
big fella one.’ They run along sea and jump
in. Then woman fright like ’ell too; they
holla out and run inside mangroves, they
leave the basket sweet-potato belong them.
Only me I no fright: I been look ’long

word, them island people fright too much :

“Sol M.”: Australia is, perhaps, rather
too proud of the fact that its gaol popula-
tion is smaller than it used to be, either be-
cause there are fewer criminals, or because
fewer are caught, or because they are let
out too soon after being captured. As far as
N.S.W. is concerned the annual gloat was
published the other day with the heading.
“The Prisons. Decreased Admissions.” And
when one comes to think over matters, the
slayer of Condon hasn’t been admitted yet,
nor the man who left the corpse of a frail
sister in the scrub out La Perouse way, nor
the individual who shot out the eye of a
drinker in a Castlereagh-street hotel the
other day, nor quite a lot of others. And
Victoria’s list of non-admitted shootists and
solicitors and so on is a very long one also.

“Coot”: On the summit of the Black
ranges, near Stawell (Vic.), exploring botan-
ists lately came across the cairn of stones and
flagpole erected by Major Mitchell in 1838.
The cairn was intact and the flagpole, cut
from a native pine, still erect.
A COURT VIGNETTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His Honor wears a bob-tailed wig, some-
. times a scarlet robe.
His duty is to state the law, the evidence to
probe.
He likes to think his law profound,
His bearing right, his judgment sound,
His patience that of Job.
Of Job's commodity, it’s true, he needs a
goodly stock.
His efforts to curtail the case the counsel
neatly block.
Ile must get very full of them;
What wonder, then, at 4 p.m.
He yawns and scans the clock? .
A Judge is keen on etiquette. Though
pleaders scorn to smother
Their rancor as they snort and sneer and
chip at one another,
llis Honor’s “stable mate,” you’ll note,
Is never termed a silly goat;
He’s always “learned brother.”
When he administers reproof the talk must
stop at that.
Each self-assertive advocate should paste
this in his hat.
Though normally so calm and bland
One thing there is lie cannot stand,
A barrister’s back-chat.
His righteous anger in such case no “ex-
planations” quench;
He threatens dreadful punishment; his hands
are seen to clench ;
His lightnings are no longer cloaked ;
He ev’n (if greatly lie’s provoked)
May rise and leave the bench!

“II.K.”: It is 86 years since the first
diving operations took pluck in Sydney
Harbor. A diving-bell arrived from England
in 1840, and a few months later it was
removing the remains of the Ann Jameson,
which had been an obstruction to shipping
for nearly seven years. After that it was
employed in building the substantial stone
wall which still exists round the south and
south-eastern part of Sydney Cove. The men
in the diving-bell received Is. per hour, and
worked a tliree-liour day.

“Erua”: In a Maoriland court each of
two solicitors claimed priority for his case,
and th-3 magistrate sportingly suggested that
the matter should be settled by the tossing
of a coin. It was—and in Parliament a few
days later an indignant member asked why
there were prosecutions and fines for dinner-
hamper raffles and newspaper crossword-
puzzles when a magistrate was allowed lo
countenance coin-tossing. Rolleston, Mao in-
land’s Attorney-General, after wrestling with
the problem, artfully ruled that the tossing
of the coin was a ballot, and as such did not
come within the scope of the Gaming Act.

“Carisbrook, Jun.”: One of the longest
telephonic links in the world was completed
the other day when a trunk-line call was
put through from Adelaide to Cairns (N.Q.).
By means of thermonic-valve relays the tone-
volume was boosted up at several interven-
ing stations. The charge for three minutes
of conversation was fl Is. Australia also
holds the distinction of having the longest
telegraph circuit in the world. Recently
Townsville (Q.) casually called up Wynd-
ham (W.A.), a line distance of over 4000
miles. The route was via the five mainland
capitals and Broome (W.A.).

“Mission”: The grimmest relic I ever saw
on church premises was at the village of Ban,
near Suva, the home of “King” Cakobau,
who ceded Fiji to Queen Victoria. It is
a heart-shaped stone on which Fijian war-
riors in their unregenerate days smashed out
the brains of their captives in war. The
stone, which has a depression in the top, is
used for a baptismal font nowadays, and
nobody seems any the worse.

“Betul” : Unscheduled train-stops? At
(say) Bigtree (Vic.), which sees only one
train a day, the local John Hop is required to
be on the station when the rattler arrives.
One day the officer happened to be in Ivefang
filling ’em up with the boys when word
drifted in that the police inspector had
arrived in the town from Bendigo, and
woujd proceed by the afternoon train to Big-
tree. Things looked none too good for the
erring constable, but the train-crew rose
to the emergency, and when the loco, pulled
out the driver had a rapidly-sobering but
still un-uniformed assistant in the cab.
Half a mile outside Bigtree there was a mys-
terious breakdown which held up the train
for 20 minutes, and when she eventually
panted into Bigtree a uniformed constable
was parading the platform with his cus-
tomary vigilance.

“Tommie Broon” : The story is told of an
opulent bachelor squatter who died not many
years since. He was conducting a middle-
aged spinster over one of his stations,. “The
land is mine as far as you can see,” he ex-
plained in answer to a question. “So are
all the cattle and the sheep you have seen,
and goodness knows how many more.” In
fact,” he added, “I have everything I could
wish here except one thing.” The lady, flut-
tering a little, ventured, “And what might
that be?” “Water!” grunted her host
morosely.

“J.G.”: Some years ago I knew a voung
man who successfully carried out the duties
of barmaid in a country pub for several
months, during which his sex was never sus-
pected by either his employer or his cus-
tomers. Those were the days when country
bungs would pay more for a skirted beer-
puller than a trousered one, and this enter-
prising youth merely borrowed an outfit from
his sister to qualify him for the job. If this
was possible in the days of long hair and
tight waists, how much easier would it be in
the present era of shingled heads and uncor-
seted figures.
“Fitzwilliam” : The most casual Australian
I have yet encountered esime to me seeking
a divorce. He knew his own name but
not his wife’s maiden or Christian one;
apparently lie had some pet name for
her which suffioed. I asked him when
and where he was married. He had
no idea of the date, but thought the place
might have been Moree, if it wasn’t Narrabri.
By searching the registers I finally dis-
covered that it was Armidale. However, he
fold the story of his wife’s neglect of her
marriage vows quite intelligibly. “It was
just after last ploughing. I was sittin’ havin’
me tea, and this bloke Jones, he just drives
up in a sulky to the gate and calls out to
her. She just puts on her hat, and says
‘Good-bye, joe, I’m off,’ and off she goes with
’im.” “Didn’t you ask where she was going?”
“Well, no, I didn’t. I didn’t think to.” “Is
that the last you saw of her?” “No, she
come, back about two munce after. I says
Ullo, and she says ‘l’ve come for my things';
and she goes inside and gets her things in a
basket and says good-bye and off they goes
again.” “Who were ‘they’?” “Why, I’m
telling yer. Jones brought her back, and she
went off with ’im again. He was waiting in
the sulky while she was packin’.” “Didn't
you speak to him?” “Well, I didn’t ’ardly
like to. He’s a bigger man than me.” I
got lam his decree nisi, and felt rather sorry
I had done so when lie reappeared, some
months later, with a letter from his wife,
saying that she was tired of Jones and would
like to come back. He added that he was
just off to fetch her.

“Te Anau”: Touching those widely-vary-
ing estimates proffered in court about the
speed of the Tahiti just before she crashed
into the Greycliffe. Unless he has access
to the ship’s instruments and records, even
the old salt can do little more than guess
at distant travel pace. The subject of the
speed of any object in motion is full of
illusions. A witness in a court case will
swear that _some offending motor-car was
exceeding 35 miles an hour through city
streets, when probably he could not plot off
a mile span on a level piece of straight
roadway without the aid of a surveyor’s
chain. Without a speedometer, or some
marked track and stop-watch device, an
estimate of the pace of a passing vehicle is
as unreliable as a box of Jap matches. At
sea the absence of convenient land-marks,
and the deceptiveness of watery vistas, make
TANTALUS.
"The question whether Canberra shall remain Dry is still fiercely debated, and
gives Mr. Bruce much uneasiness.”
the mental arithmetic of the unofficial speed
calculator even more erratic. When a brisk,
steady breeze ruffles Sydney Harbor, a
racing yacht of 20ft. or so seems to cleave
through the sea as smartly as a George
street tram rattling downhill to the Quay.
But actual speed tests, timed over fixed
courses, prove that a 20ft. racer, even with
half a gale of wind favorably over its
quarter, can rarely reach seven knots —barely
twice as fast as a fat man can negotiate a
busy Sydney footpath. Relative sizes are
always disturbing factors in estimating
pace. A pigeon seems to outpace a bee in a
straight flight, but tests over a 3|-mile course
have proved the bee to be the fleeter, with
an average speed of IT miles a minute.

“Prickly Jack” : Now that the closed car
has come to stay the obvious position for the
rear number is near the top of the hood.
The rear number is the one which prostrated
pedestrians and ignored police are most likely
to look for, and there is no sense in placing
it low in the dust and crowded to one side
by bumper-bars, spare wheel and luggage-
rack. The permanent hood, now almost
universal, provides a much better position
from the point of view of visibility; the
additional space permits of larger numbers
and allows for the seven figures which will
soon be necessary at the present rate of
registration.
“M.G.S.”: If the law was properly inter-
preted in a recent Melbourne case it sorely
needs amendment. A young man armed with
a motor-car ran over and killed a woman in
Box Hill, a crowded suburb which has been
recently raised to the dignity of a city. He
admitted to 30 miles an hour at the time,
and various spectators thought it was nearer
40. After hitting the woman so hard that
most of the bones in her body were broken
and the car was lifted off the ground, he
sped on to a quiet place where lie could
alter his number-plate. Yet lie was found
not guilty of manslaughter and acquitted.

“Wang”; Guy Fawkes’ Day still holds its
tragedies; one of them occurred in our sub-
urb. Mum had handed the kids a very old
coat of dad’s to fashion a Guy out of. That
night, as the youngsters were whooping joy-
ously around their bonfire, a wild-eyed man
cam& rushing up and had to be forcibly pre-
vented by some of the bystanders from hurl-
mg himself into the conflagration. It was
dad. The old coat, now m the final stage
of cremation was his unsafe-deposit vault.
In one of the pockets lie had planted five
one-pound notes, his Cup winnings, which lie
was keeping a secret from mum!
“Krypton” : The nuirex shell-fish may have
been the source of the “lost” purple of
Tyre (B. 10/11/’27) ; if so, it only shows
how superior are coal-tar colors to all natu-
ral dyes in beauty as well as fastness. One
Friedlander in pre-war days studied the
liquid that is squeezed out from the gullet
of the patient murex—one drop per victim.
lie treated 12,000 of the tribe, and found
that the color was nothing but a humble
relation of indigo—chemists had known it
since 1903, and it had long since been con-
signed to the rubbish-heap as not even fit
to color confetti with. So much for the
wonderful secrets of the Ancients!

“Kerys”: At least one Maoriland church

We may live to see the advt.: “Gratuitous

“Selma”: Speaking of the “sheep-sale-
yards” , cure for whooping-cough (B.
17/11/’27). Some years ago I was passing
the gasworks in a M.L. township when
from one of the sheds came the yells of a
child in distress. Thinking some youngster
might have got into a dangerous place.
I picked my way between heaps of coal and
coke to investigate. Inside a large out-build-
ing sat half a dozen women, sewing and
knitting, while several children played round,
tlie ear-piercing shrieks I had heard being
the protest of one infant because another
had taken his golliwog. The town, I
learned, was suffering from a whooping-cough
epidemic, and as gas-fumes in moderat
are supposed to bs beneficial, these uiotiie s
had for some weeks spent part ot each day •

“Black Tracker”: A youthful burglar was
brought to book in Adelaide recently in a
most extraordinary way. Included in the
cash stolen was a sovereign. Although well
up in his ’teens the lad had never before
handled such a coin, and put it down for a
gold medal of some sort. It was through his
attempt to dispose of it as such that sus-
picion fell on him and inquiries were made,
* * * *
“F.S.G.”: In the bank where I
figure for a crust a sudden emerg-
ency led to a youthful officer with-
out previous counter experience
being temporarily pitchforked into
the receiving-teller’s job. Balancing
up at the end of the first day he
found himself a pound to the bad,
which sum, in accordance with the
bank’s rules, lie was called upon to
make good. On hearing of liis .son’s
misfortune, dad came to tlie rescue
and reimbursed him the pound.
Next the news reached the ears of
a doting aunt, and forthwith the
embryo teller received another
pound. Later, a more elderly rela-
tive heard of the mishap, and
straightway posted her favorite
grandson a 20s. postal-note. And
Dame Fortune hadn’t finished at
that. At the termination of his
impromptu tellership, the manager
congratulated the youthful officer
on his efficiency, and intimated that
as he had only been filling the posi-
tion temporarily the institution
would stand by him anti refund him
the forfeited pound.
“Kwinana” : Wireless has already
saved thousands of lives at sea,
and it might have saved far more
but for the fact that most vessels
carry only one operator, who can-
not be continuously on the watch
for the fateful SOS call. Hence
one reads with satisfaction of an
apparatus, recently approved of by
the British Government, which
promises to meet this difficulty.
The distress call is to be altered;
four long dashes, thrice repeated,
will be sent out before the SOS.
The dashes, which cannot be mixed
with ordinary Morse or a burst of
“auto,” will energise a relay, and
this in turn will ring alarm-bells
in the operator’s cabin and on the
bridge of the ship. Thus, should
the operator be off watch, he will
be warned by the clamorous ring-
ing, and by taking up his tele-
phones will be enabled to obtain
the position of the stricken ship.
The sooner the new invention is
utilised in Australian waters the
better, for practically all inter-
state steamers carry only one
wireless operator, and the “watch"
period consists of only eight hours
daily. At present, if an SOS is
sent out during the other 16-liour
periods, only overseas vessels can
pick it up.
“Jack Point”: Add to the varie-
gated record of the late “Squizzy”
Taylor that he once starred in" a
movie. The play was a romance
of tlie turf, with “Squizzy” as the
jockey who was pounced upon by
ruffians the night before the big
race which was to decide whether
the squire’s beautiful daughter
would have to marry the hated
Lord Swindlem, who held the mort-
gage, or would be free to follow
her heart’s dictates and propose to
the jock. “Squizzy,” of course,
turned down the scoundrel’s pro-
position, and duly steered the prad
to victory. The only remarkable thing about
the performance was that Taylor showed
himself at home on the outside of a horse,
rather surprising for a product of a big
city’s slums.

“Bildad” : If is a far-back tale or lie, that
of “Ex-Dig.,” about how 7 some Red-Taper in
London complained that Australian soldiers
didn’t salute, and how “Tommy Dodds” burst
into roars and swears and wanted to know
why real soldiers should salute “blanked
popinjays who never heard anything more
like a blanked shot than the blanked popping
of a champagne cork.” The warrior in ques-
tion, it is added, “hated the office-soldier
almost as much as he hated the politician.”
Still, the British officers wdio were in Lon-
don when Tommy Dodds was there himself
were not all popinjays who had never heard
a shot fired. And the fact of a military or
naval man having a job away from the Front
didn’t prove that he had never been at some
front or other, and didn’t want to go again.
Even Jellicoe and Kitchener had political or
office or armchair billets during part of the
SHE’D RATHER HAVE THEM HATCHED THAN ADDLED.
“Why don’t you get a man about your own age? You always seem to find chickens.”
“M’yes, but I’d rather have my chickens than your bad eggs!”
Great War, and so had Lawrence of Arabia
and an immense number more. A general
who only had the chance to pay a short visit
to the real Front was Cowans, Q.M.G. All
he had to do was to find food (even if the
food ships had almost ceased to arrive),
clothes, boots, blankets, medical supplies and
sundries for a million or two of men between
Belgium and the Euphrates, Australians in-
cluded, and some for Allies in difficulties,
and to deliver the goods. Therefore he had
buying-agents, or popinjays, in many lands.
Also he had to feed, clothe and, to a great
extent, house recruits by the hundred thou
sand. He was the kind of man who mad
victory possible, for starving, ragged, shoe-
less troops with bleeding feet don’t fight well,
not even Australian troops under Tommy
Dodds. And politicians like Lloyd George
and Clemenceau have their uses, if it is only
in finding the money for these doings. No
general wins a war nowadays unless he has
good office-soldiers and politicians at the
back of him. It was the lack of them that
destroyed Russia. Its Tommy Doddski at
the Front was the bravest of the brave, but
the office-soldier and politician at the rear
were not the British or French type.
“Mayne Stay”: I was watching tho
ancient train with the venerable locomotive
preparing to depart- from Cooktown (Q.) :
tw’o dear old ladies were seeing off a third,
who had been paying a brief visit to the
town. After the usual “Remember me to
Lizzie” and so on, one of the farewellers
ventured: “Well, Mrs. Simpson, I suppose
you’ll be glad to get home again?” The
emphatic answer from the carriage-window
appealed to me, a Sydneysider. “ ’Deed I
will; this city life is no good to me.”

“Black Tracker” : A childless widower in
S Aus. engaged a young married couple for
station work. Two years later the woman
gave birth to'a little girl, Mary; 18 months
later an Annie arrived. As the children
called both men daddy complications were
expected, but they were some time, in coming.
When on a motor tour the land-owner met
with an accident that proved fatal. When
dying he signed a short will leaving every-
thing to his daughters Mary and Annie. His
relatives claim that as lie had no daughters
the will was invalid. On the other hand the
mother of the children has filed an affidavit
declaring that he is the father of both chil-
dren. her husband having been such in no-
thing more than name. The husband has
filed supporting affidavit, and, to clinch the
matter, produced a medical certificate.

“Herodot”: The fern-hooks which pro-
vided two Italians with duelling weapons In
Victoria (B. 10/11/27) should be dan-
gerous than the cane-knives with wdiich N.-Q.
combatants occasionally carve each other up.
In the Innisfail hospital a few years ago
some hundreds of stitches had to be inserted
in the carcases of a couple of foreigners who
had started a scrap with these implements,
although the pair had been dragged apart
when only a few blows had been struck. In
a fight further north between a Swede and
a Maltese, the former cut off his opponent's
head at a single blow; and at Mackay
about 20 years ago a couple of Kanakas
from the Solomons were both left hacked to
pieces and dying upon the field. The blade
of the cane-knife is nearly straight, thus
enabling both cuts and thrusts to be delivered
with terrific force behind them, while the
fern-hook’s curved blade makes it dangerous
only when it is swung in a wide sweep.

MAE: “My! How ever did she get as thin as that?”
“Knib” : One morning in the early ’nineties
the late, T. R. Wilson, permanent head of the
Vic. Chief Sec.'s Department, w r as wading
through a mass of papers on the first floor of
the old Treasury, Spring-street, when a heavy
hand fell on his shoulder and a rough voice
bellowed into his left ear,
“I’m the hangman.” Wilson
eyed his visitor with extreme
disfavor and broke out:
“Well, what the devil do you
want with me? I don’t re-
member having killed any-
body. and in any case I
haven’t been tried by a
Judge and jury.” Ketch hur-
riedly disclaimed having any
professional designs on the
departmental head and pro-
ceeded to explain his busi-
ness. He had, it transpired,
a grievance against the gaol
authorities, and, all efforts
to get it rectified having-
failed, he had come up to
headquarters and had man-
aged to elude the messengers.
Wilson, who had a sense of
hum o r, undertook to
straighten up the matter, and
did. But, before showing his
visitor out, he suggested that
the latter should send in his
card the next time he called.
“Windsor” : The spin of a
coin cost the lives of three
Victorian visitors in the Syd-
ney Harbor disaster. They
were discussing their pro-
gramme for the day at the
Tourist Bureau and could
not make up their minds
whether to take a trip on the
harbor or to go to Kuring-gai
Chase. Finally it was sug-
gested and agreed that they
toss up—“heads” for the har-
bor and “tails” for the Chase. Death chuck-
led in the shadows when the coin rolled
over to “heads” ; the visitors went dowm in
the Greycliffe.
* H* ❖
. “Oxmead” : At the corner of Hunter and
Bligh streets (Sydney) the City Council has
thoughtfully erected a memorial to mark the
site of the first religious service held in
Australia on Feb. 3, 1788, and the first place
of worship erected a few 7 years later. The
first text from which a sermon was preached
in these latitudes is preserved on one side
of the monument; it is from Psalm 116:
“What shall I render unto the Lord for his
benefits towards me?” Considering that most
of Chaplain Richard Johnson’s congregation
were convicts, tho text seems to have been
somewhat tactlessly chosen. Some of them
may have owed thanks to Heaven for escap-
ing the gallows, but one doubts if they would
have been ready to admit as much. The
church was opened in 1763 and burned down
in 1798—there is a tradition that the incen-
diaries were convicts who disliked compulsory
churchgoing. They may have disliked texts
such as the above, too. Personally I enter-
tain a doubt whether the. first religious ser-
vice by Christian people in Australia was
really held here. The Dutchmen who were
wrecked on the Abrolhos Islands, off Gerald-
ton (W.A.), nearly 150 years sooner, were
pious folk, even though they fell on one
another before their enforced sojourn was
through, and they almost certainly lifted up
their voices in community-prayer now and
again.

“Ken”: A woman dangerously ill was
recently transported by aeroplane from a
station near Win ton (Q.) to Sydney, a
distance of 1200 miles. The car used
was specially fitted up with a comfortable
stretcher and seats for two people alongside.
The first day’s journey took the party as far
as Bourke. Here the night was spent, the
sick woman patient remaining in the aero-
plane, and the two watchers sleeping on
stretchers placed under the wings. Sydney
was reached at 2 p.m. next day. The patient
is now out of danger.
❖ ❖ ❖ *
“Phil P.”: America, w.s are perpetually
hearing, has become the richest country in
the world ; judging by the records of several
timber droghers which have drifted into Aus-
tralian ports lately, its shipowners must
also be the meanest. No margin for . a pro-
tracted trip seems to be made when sea-
stores are embarked. Several ships have
been towed in with a famine in the tucker-
locker, and in no less than three cases also
the crews have had to “attach” their craft to
secure their wages. It looks as though the
owners, or agents, grab the charter-money as
soon as the vessel sails, and a slow passage
means little left for the shellbacks. Time
was when Americans used to boast about the
ciuality and quantity.of the food supplied
under the Stars and Stripes, but the indi-
cations are that Uncle has quite a lot to
learn from J. Bull in the mercantile-marine
department.
A MURRAY STEAMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long, long ago there sailed the seas Egyptian
quinquiremes,
Vessels of Tyre and Carthage, and
galleons of Spain.
They spread their colored sails aloft to catch
the morning beams,
And set their course adventurous across
the lonely main.
They carried precious cargoes then to coun-
tries far aw 7 ay,
Silks and spices, ivory and gold embroid-
eries,
From Abyssinia and Ind, Kashmir and dim
Cathay,
And silver, gold and jewels mined across
the western seas.
To-day the little Murray ship Pervensey,
steaming slow,
Drops anchor at Eehuea wharf and rests
beside the quay.
What kin is she to those brave craft that
sailed so long ago?
She has not felt the tugging tide nor seen
the surging sea.
And yet romance invests her; there is
treasure in her hold.
Wool bales from Lake Victoria, and timber
Barham sawn ;
Mildura fruits sun-kissed, sun-sweet; Hes-
peridean gold
Of Perricoota oranges, bright-tinted as the
dawn.
Still as of old, ’mid Arctic ice or ’neafh
the Southern sun.
Romance enfolds eacli argosy of oar or
sail or steam.
From thoughts of deeds adventurous, fond
memory has spun
A magic veil about her and the glamor of
a dream.
VICTORIA.

Early in the term the board called for
£200,000 of new capital, half in 6 p.c. prefs.
and the other half in ords., and it had no
difficulty in getting the money, most of
which was wanted to buy 153,000 new £1
shares in Marcus Clark (Vic.), Ltd. A
little over a srear5 r ear ago that co. bought
the business of Craig, Williamson Pty., Ltd.,
a Melbourne drapery house with a big mail-
order connection. The balance of the cash —-
there was £45,369 at call when the books
were ruled off on Aug. 31 —is earmarked
for the co.’s new building in Central-square,
Sydney; a contract for this has been let
and the job should be finished next year. The
board, however, does not mention how it
proposes to finance any additional outlay.
During the year no dividends were re-
ceived from the Vic. co., but owing to brisker
trade gross profit (£115,336) sprang
£18,747, and net profit, which increased by
£10,172, thus reaching £77,998, got most of
the improvement. Disclosed net earnings,
however, have not been greatly in excess
of distributions. After allowing for depreci-
ation, shown as written off in the table,
divs. called for a shade over 79 p.c. of the
total net profits over the last five years.
The visible lay-by over that period was
£65.883, making reserves £210,287, equal to
nearly 27 p.c. of the paid capital compared
with 29 p.c. five years back. The fact that
over half the paid capital is in prefs.—
£268,755 6 p.c. and £175,000 74 p.c.—helps
to make 10 p.c. to the ords. a more com-
fortable matter. After satisfying the prefs.
last year’s net profit was 13.5 p.c. on
average ord. capital compared with 15, 16.1,
17.9 and 14.1 p.c. back to 1923. But it has
to be remembered that the new capital
brought in nothing last year, and that for
the past two years there has been a lot
of money in freehold which has not been
earning anything. Earning power should
benefit when divs. begin to flow in from the
Victorian investment, and as space becomes
available in the new building. So far as the
former is concerned immediate prospects
are not very bright. Trade generally in
Melbourne is not brisk, and competition in
the retail rag trade there is very keen.
This comparison of balance-sheet figures
shows the marked expansion of the N. S.
Wales business over the past seven years:—

The financial position was comfortable
enough. To meet liabilities totalling
£366,643, including the mortgage, there was
£708,239 in stocks, book debts and cash,
etc. Book debts are substantial (£515.785,
up £18.151) ; they reflect the co.’s extensive
t.-p. business. In the past the risks do not
appear to have been underestimated, nor
have profits suffered severely from falling
markets, which suggests that stocks have
been carefullv valued. Brisk sale of stocks —
they dropped £76.201 during the year, and
stand at the lowest figure for the
past nine years—enabled the management
to wipe off £49.259 of the debt to trade
creditors, reducing it to £207.143.
The net tangible backing for the fully-paid
shares at Aug. 31 was £3 13s. Bd. for the
first prefs. and £4 2s. sd. for the second
prefs. Last year net profit was 2J times
their combined dividend requirements; the
market prices the firsts at par and gives
21s. for the seconds. At the latter figure the
return is 7.2 p.c. For the ords. the cover
amounts to 325. 6d. in net tangibles, and the
price is 275. 9d. That returns the investor
Y. 2 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.

Under ordinary circumstances that drup of
£12,659 in last year’s income would be a
serious matter. But the 1926 figures did not
wholly represent real money ; they were in-
flated by a writing up of the assets in an
unspecified amount. Nevertheless, improve-
ment in that year appears to have been
definite, although nothing like as good as
claimed. The table needs to be considered
in relation to these figures:—
1925. 1926. 1927.
Proposals accepted 5,084 5.178 6,008

Total income . . 139,778 180,038* 167,379
appreciation of assets.
Acceptances have shown annual improve-
ment ; in its 61 years of policy-writing the
co. has won £8,589,888 of business. The
average amount assured last year was £291
compared witli £827 and £315 in the two pre-
ceding years, and 44.3 p.c. of the business in
force at June 30 was whole-life assurances,
the improvement amounting to 2.3 p.c. dur-
ing the year. All of this can be accepted
as satisfactory. In young offices a big per-
centage of lapsed business is taken for
granted, and the Southern Cross, which
writes policies in Australia, Maoriland and
S. Africa, is no exception. The growth in
last year’s renewals loses much of its bright-
ness when you add to the 1926 renewals
(£80,571) the premiums yielded by the new
business written that year (£65,636) ;
together £146,207. The amount actually
received in renewals last year was only
£95,766; claims, of course, take their toll,
but there is obviously a big percentage of
lapses. However, the position in that respect
is better than it was a couple of years back.
Further very definite improvement is, never-
theless, necessary to prevent the waste that
results from early surrenders.
Assuming that old business cost p.c.,
and charging the balance of the year’s exes,
against new business, the policies written
last year cost 202 p.c. compared with' 191
p.c., 212 p.c., 256 p.c. and 216 p.c. back to
1923. That is very expensive business and
amongst other things means that premiums
do not begin to contribute to funds, and
therefore toward bonuses to policy-holders
and divs for shareholders, until at least the
third year. Including interest on mortgage,
exes, gobbled 80.4 p.c. of the entire premium
income last year compared with 86.6. 94.9,
119.9 and 127.8 p.c. back to 1923. The co.
is faced with the necessity of cutting costs
and building up its funds. The co.’s first
quinquennium ended in 1926, but the actu-
ary’s detailed valuation figures were not sent
out with the sheet. Liabilities under policies,
however, amounted to £156.488, and the in-
surance fund at the beginning of that term
was £20,516; also there was £31,250 of share
premiums that had come in in response to a
bold request a few years earlier. The 1926
surplus income was £38,569. including the
writing up; so to make the fund cover lia-
bilities £66,153 was added to the establish-
ment account. The same sort of thing Avas
repeated last year, except that the assets
were not written up. The actuary figured
liabilities under policies at June 30 at
£203,710, or £47,221 more than in 1926.
Last year’s surplus income aatis £21.773
short of that, so the difference was capital-
ised. Thus the cost of establishment, orga-
nisation and new business extension stands
in the book at £195,530, including £3OOO paid
to the A.P.A. for the goodwill of its
S’African business. Notwithstanding this,
after deducting the accident fund (£7413).
policy-holders could see net tangibles with a
book value of £310,600 at June 30, and that
was 52.4 p.c. in excess of the actuarial lia-
bility. Deducting them, only £106,890 re-
mained to represent £300.000 of shareholders’
capital. The co. is fighting hard to establish
itself on a solid basis and its prospects are
not discouraging; but much depends upon
the management’s ability to so cut exes, that
bonuses can be paid to policy-holders. After
that the intangibles call for reduction. Be-
sides, at .Tune 30 over 25,000 of accrued
divs. was owing on 125,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
A lot of money will have to be accumulated
before the ords. get into the picture. At
June 30 outside liabilities totalled £95,166
including £57,500 on mortgage. Tangible
assets stood in the books at £405,766, of
which £189,979 was in freeholds and equip-
ment ; £114,530 was in public securities and
£101,257 in book debts, shares, cash, etc.
In the Accident department the volume
of business is growing, but last year’s re-
sults—outgo called for £2525 more than
income—wiped out more than half the total
profits of the preceding five years.

The extraordinary leap in the 1926 figures
was due to bigger turnover. New depart-
ments were added to the London business
and additions were made to factory premises
there and in Melbourne and Sydney. But
what matters most is that the increased
business lias been held; the drop of £3839
in last year’s net earnings was the result
of bigger exes, on account of Australian
trading, gross profits from which expanded
£1784 to £70.623. This comparison shows

The £lO,OOO that came in from foreign in-
vestments in 1924 was 21 p.c. on the book
value of the holding (£47,455), which was
unchanged in 1926, so that divs that year
(£30,000) were at the rate of 63.2 p.c.
At June 30 last foreign and Australian in-
vestments were lumped at £63,389, or £9196
less than the combined figures a year earlier.
During the year the board turned down an
alluring offer of £200,000 cash for Kia Ora,
Ltd., the London business. Obviously, then,
the foreign investments are greatly under-
valued in the books. Reserves in the
table are described as nominal because they
include an unspecified amount of goodwill
and trade-marks, lumped with bottles, etc.,
at £59,864 —unchanged over the last five
years. But the undisclosed assets must
enormously outweigh the goodwill items in
the sheet.
It is only 18 years since the co. took
over John Dixon’s mineral- and aerated-
water factory at Prahran (Vic.). Soon
operations were extended to Sydney and
elsewhere in Australia ; then attention was
turned to America, and manufacture was
commenced at San Francisco. After extend-
ing to other centres, the co. established a
factory at Messina, Sicily, about three years
ago, chiefly to supply the London business
with citrus juice. Now the co.’s products
are sold in almost every country in the
world. From a small factory at Prahran
the business has grown to international pro-
portions with remarkable speed. Naturally,
the growth has called for constant exten-
sions and additions to plant, etc., and for
the most part the outlay has been met out
of profits. Balance-sheet figures reflect the
expansion;—

To meet liabilities totalling £21,922, there
was £101,965 in stocks, book debts and
cash. The improvement in last year’s liquid
surplus (£80,043) was £19.251. Land and
buildings are in at cost (£22,722) and the
figures are over 10 years old, so there is
a nice inner reserve there. Eleven years
ago the co. bought 13 acres at Daylesford
(Vic.), mainly for fuel purposes; the timber
is now cut out and the area is soon to be
subdivided and sold as building allotments.
There should be a tidy profit in it.
To meet recent developments, shareholders
were offered 25,000 £1 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
just before the books closed, and there was
a rush to take up a good thing. When all

£158.599. of which £133,599 is in ords. In-
cluding goodwill and trade-marks, referred
to above, the net visible backing for the
pound prefs. figures out at £9 11s. lid., and
last year’s net profit was over 19 times their
annual requirements. After that the ords.
could see £1 12s. 2d. per share net; and
then the beforemen tioned under-valuation
of some of the assets must be taken into
account. On the market sellers ask 245. for
the prefs; for the ords. buyers offer oOs.
without attracting sellers. At the latter
figure the return is 8 p.c. as long as the
20 p.c. div. continues.

Howard Smiths bought a controlling interest
in this co. 13 years ago, and since then
shipping influences have no doubt greatly
affected the lay-out of the figures. The net
profits disclosed have never been greatly in
excess of div. requirements ; the latter have
called for over 90 p.c. of the total net earn-
ings since 1920, and twice during that time
the declared profits have been exactly the
amount required for the div —which would be
very wonderful if one didn’t know that
balance-sheet figures don’t always mean what
they say. Still, even the big. co. can’t quite
control the figures; industrial troubles of one
kind and another affect the real earnings.
The shipping and the colliery engine-drivers’
strikes disturbed the 1925 and 1926 figures;
last year there were no stoppages of any
importance in either industry, and the man-
agement was able to double the profit and
therefore the div. It may be taken for
granted that adequate provision has been
made for depreciation, wastage and contin-
gencies before profit figures are written into
the naked sheet. In addition to the accumu-
lations shown above, there is an accident
and insurance reserve, which has steadily
grown to £20,166 without interruption over
the last 11 years—£234 was added last year.
The probabilities are that it is true profit,
in which case reserves total £32,295 and the
net increase since 1916 has been £30,661.
That the position is not made to look
better than it is may be gathered from these
figures
1916. 1925. 1926. 1927.

Liabilities . . 3,588 7,326 7,856 8;37G
Surplus . . £6,822 £55,462 £51,413 £54,839
While paid capital has remained steady at
£104,000 and liquids have been accumulat-
ing, a good deal of money has gone into
fixed assets. In the last four years, for
instance, £7244 more was visibly spent on the
mine, plant, etc., than was written off. Fixed
assets stand in the books at £87,695, equal
to 16s. lOd. per share; and surplus liquids,
after allowing for the final div., represent
another Bs. 9d. To what extent, if any,
the co. will benefit from the recent opening
of the line to Broken Hill remains to be
seen. The market, which looks at the indus-
trial risks and the fact that over the past
decade shareholders have had an average
of only 81 p.c., neatly prices the scrip at 21s.
At that figure the return is 91 p.c. as long
as the 10 p.c. div. continues, or 71 p.c. on
an average 8 p.c. div. basis.

Forward contracts largely offset a rise in
prices in the markets for the co.’s raw
materials, so the year’s net profit con-
tracted only £232. But looked at in the
ratio of net earnings to average capital the
drop was more pronounced; 15.6 p.c. was
netted last year compared with 17.1, 16.6,
14 and 10.9 p.c. back to 1923. They are
healthy results, leaving a comfortable margin
over the 124 p.c. div. The performance is
all the more striking inasmuch as half the,
capital is represented by “properties.” The
£72,500 of intangibles in the sheet is of less
consequence because it is almost balanced by
£67.238 of reserves shown in the table; in
addition to that there is £80,096 put by
to meet contingencies and depreciation and
£4750 labelled insurance reserves. Another
factor affecting last year’s earning power was
the issue of 42,276 new £1 shares early in
the term ; the last £9073 of the money did
not come in until after the books 'were
ruled off. Paid capital is now therefore
£211,383; but a 124 p.c. div. on this in-
creased amount will call for £2334 less than
the £28.757 netted last year. As office and
factory space becomes available in the co.’s
new seven-storeyed building, completion of
which is expected about March next, over-
head should be reduced. This ought to assist
in the maintenance of the present dividend;

The £33,204 of new capital that came in
enabled the board to clip £11.534 off the
mortgage, reducing it to £20,443. The bal-
ance went mostly into liquids. The trade
debts (£32.636) grew £16,752, making total
liabilities £53,06!); to meet which there was
£x03,445 in cash, book debts and stocks. But
that position will alter as payments arc
made on the new building. Considering the
growth of the business of recent years, stocks
are by no means heavy.
Excluding the depreciation, contingency

slightly better than the return to be had
from the purchase of similar-date 5 } per

only a limited volume of buying to force up
prices above the 5| p.c. level, so the holder
who does not convert, in the hope of buying
a similar security on better terms later, may
be disappointed.

Tasmanite Shale Oil Co. is the latest
form of the Tasmanite Shale Oil Syndicate
and New Southern Cross Motor Fuels, Ltd.
The idea is to extract oil from shale by the
Long retort system at Latrobe (Tas.).
Nominal capital is in 300,000 £1 shares of
which 110,000 are offered; 36,000 fully paids
and £lOOO go to the vendor and £lO,OOO will
be used to wipe out the debts of the New
Southern Cross Co., which had spent £62,000
on development and research. The remaining
154,000 shares are in cold store. The co.
gets a nine years’ lease of a shale-mine
with the right to renew for a further 10
years; also the plant on the mine, five acres
of freehold at Davenport East and a
license to use the Long retort in Tas. free
of rent. Deposits are estimated at 12,000,000
tons shale, and a royalty of Is. on each
ton mined is payable to the Railton Lat-
robe Co. A t battery of 24 retorts, expected
to yield an Average of 8000 gallons of crude
oil per day, is to be installed, with refining
and storage equipment. Capital outlay is
set down at £64,790, and after allowing for
depreciation and taxation, but including a
Government bounty of £42,583, net profit is
figured at £61,693, equal to 40 p.c. on a
paid capital of £146,000. Success will partly
depend upon the economical treatment of a
band of rock between the upper and lower
seams of oil shale.

H. E. Pratten, Australia’s Minister for
Trades and Customs, whose recent visit to
Britain on a political mission has already
borne such good fruit for Australia, was
one of the pioneers of tin-dredging in Malaya.
When he joined the Commonwealth Ministry
he relinquished his active interests and re-
sponsibilities in the industry. ITis visit to
England was in no way connected with pri-
vate business, and the fact that the big Allu-
vial Tin sale to a British company took
place while he was in Britain had nothing to
do with his presence there. It was brother
F.G. who. with his assistants Newman and
Macdougall, engineered that coup.
This is the list of the 38 men and corpora-
tions that have taken in 10,000-acre pro-
specting areas all the country within 20
miles of the Roma boreholes: —

Young, H. J. : Snow, Sydney ; Vickers, J. ; Randolph
Bedford and Co. ; Roma Co. and Timsburv ; Landers
Oil Co.
Most of the area is held by three groups—
(l) Roma Oil Co., Lander Oil Co. and
Builders, Ltd., of Sydney; (2) John Wren;
(3) Dan Green. Randolph Bedford is
understood to be co-operating with John
Wren ; and E. and J. Carroll are probably
behind Dan Green.
“Roman”: Re “Catalist’s” statement (B.
17/11/’2T) that “Roma gas is a ‘dry’ gas
containing only 14 pint of petrol per 1000
cubic feet of gas.” There are plants in
Texas (U.S.A.) extracting as little as half
a pint of petrol per 1000 c.f. of gas; and in
May, 1927, altogether 3,219,000 barrels of
petrol were produced in the XI.S.A. from
plants working on natural gas at the well-
side.
Randolph Bedford writes : “Catalist” says
“the position at Roma is practically no
different from what it was when the first
bore was opened 21 years ago.” llow is it
the same? Daily for many weeks past oil
has been running, not “intermittently,” but
daily whenever the well is tested, usually
for an hour a day. And how can gas
yielding by absorption 14 pint of petrol
per 1000 c.f. of gas be called a “dry” gas?
The best men on the job also deny that the
oil is a condensate, and the more recent
accompaniment of water highly saline points
definitely to the closeness of the well to an
oil-pool and is all against the contention
of long-distance migration or condensation.
:!: * * *
The Queensland Cabinet is thinking of
sending L. C. Ball, its oil geologist and a
member of the State Advisory Oil Board,
to America while Roma is quiescent. It is
not considered likely that there will be any
developments there until No. 2 and No. 3
bores get down, wdiich may be six months
from now. Ball has all the current oil litera-
ture stored in his brain-cells, ripened by
observations and field work at Roma and
elsewhere. A little personal contact with
U.S.A. oil geologists, the thrashing out of
their difficulties in the way of testing gas-
and oil-wells, and the experience obtained
by observing the testing and flow of wells
should be of incalculable benefit to his State
if it turns out to be a commercial gas- or
oil-producer, one of which alternatives
appears certain. It would give an oppor-
tunity to acquire, first hand, the important
technical and professional minutise which
can only be got by direct contact with men
and operations on producing fields. Ball is a
graduate in engineering of the Sydney
Uni., and has all the professional frame-
work on which to build to the greatest
advantage. For three years he has special-
ised in oil -geology.
There has been a sharp rise in Isas. The
buying is from London. Silver values have
been consistently low in late tests, but lead
assays, particularly from the Rio Grande,
hold the attention. For instance, the north
drive No. 2 Rio has averaged 17 p.c. lead
for the last 33 feet over a width of 4ft.
6in., with ore extending out both ways. The
south drive averaged 10 p.c. lead over the
last IS feet. Water is getting short, and
this, with the fly plague and the summer
broil, may account for the lethargy on the
field at present.

New- Shrimp surprised the Kangaroo Ilills
field (N.Q.) with the biggest output for
October, ousting Sardine from a position
long held and one that recently appeared
without rivalry. The show' is part of the
old Shrimp lease held by the Towers Co.
before an ultimate crush curtailed company
operations. St. Smith gave the old Shrimp
a good boost, but the co. must have tackled
it in a bad spot, and the average of ore-
veins and mullock was too poor to pay its
way. The New Shrimp party has driven
a tunnel off the hillside, cutting the vertical
shafts 40ft. to 50ft. down, and beyond them
have run into a 3ft. lode which they have
followed for 10ft. The face averages about
8 p.c. oxide, and last month’s crushing of
86 tons for 6.7 tons of concentrates averages
out at that figure. It will provide several
more like crushings, but beyond that the
“Wild Cat” won’t predict till further driving
and crosscutting is done, remembering the
notoriously lens-shaped ore shoofs they get
on the Hills.
* ❖
The company’s operations on the mother
lode at Ravenswood (N.Q.) have started
with promising prospects. The crushing
from the main winze averaged 15dwt. gold
for 96 tons, and the new' tunnel being driven
to connect with the winze has struck the
lode 25ft. in. dish prospects giving 12dwt.
The germs of a payable mining proposition
are apparent; but most of these shows that
must work cheaply fail on lay-out of plant
and intermittent water-supply. Costs can’t
be kept down on low-grade stuff unless there
is minimum handling and smooth and con-
tinuous running. Further, this mine has a
heavy yoke to carry, as 24 out of every
60 shares w r ere issued as paid ups. It may be
a case of killing the goose as soon as the
poor thing was hatched.
* £ $ $
S. African gold-mining practice is to spend
liberally on development before commencing
ore-treatment facilities: a co. may spend
£250.000 on shaft sinking and levels before
producing a bar of bullion. Generally, Aus-
tralian practice has been to get the battery
going and trust to luck for ore. Wiluna is
an exception; already a quarter of a million
lias gone into development (principally at
the 300 ft. level), metallurgical research and
sundries, while only 115 oz. bullion has so far
been recovered, and this by an experimental
plant. Before the mine reaches the pro-
duction stage, probably half a million will
have been expended, not including the cost
of proposed Government railway, which,
including rolling stock, can easily mean
£300,000. The co. is relying for success on
the great volume of ore deposits and regular
gold content (about 30s. per ton). Still, in
view of the fact that a satisfactory recovery
has not yet been demonstrated in actual
running, the venture is speculative enough
to be exciting.
* * * *
That the race of hammer-and-drill miners
has not died out is shown by the fact that
the 10ft. by 4ft. shaft at the Glenelg Queen
(W.A.) has been sunk 117 ft. by hand-beaten
drills, the last week’s progress being 14ft.
Glenelg field looks like being a dry area, as
so far the State boring party has failed to
strike water. Probably the Glenelg Queen
shaft will be more successful; if it isn’t the
outlook for mine-owners will be bad.

Westralian Mines Department’s chief
mineralogist, Dr. Simpson, is said to have
been greatly impressed with the extent of
the tin and tantalum deposits on the Pilbara
field. One patch of tantalum at Wodgina
is declared to be the main supply of the
whole world at present, while the tin lodes
of Tabba Tabba are described as rich. But
costs are appalling.

“Antibadak”: When any technically-
trained man experienced in tin-fields reads
of the glowing future awaiting shareholders
in the Bawonga Tin Co., Mitta Mitta
(Vic.), as outlined in its prospectus, and
then inspects the field, the rosy picture
becomes clouded. lit the Vic. Survey Bul-
letin of 1915 there is something regarding
the Mitta Mitta tin-fields, which embrace
Bowonga. Referring to the attempts pre-
viously made to show the stanniferous dykes
of that district to be of commercial value,
it says: “The enterprise is within, or little
beyond, the prospecting stage. No sys-
tematic underground work has yet demon-
strated that ore of payable quality exists
in sufficient quantity to ensure continuous
extraction on a scale adequate to furnish a
reasonable profit.” My recent investiga-
tions bear out this statement; The 10-ton
parcel of ore sent to Tasmania from
Bawonga for treatment yielded one per cent,
and speaks for itself. The high-percentage
ore exists only in isolated patches and
specimens. The prospecting so far carried
out has disclosed much mica and feldspar,
but little tin oxide. It is highly improb-
able that 100 tons of payable ore could be
scraped together on the field in its present
condition. Even if the ore so far disclosed
were payable, a heap of capital would be
required to sufficiently open up and block
out the dykes in order to continuously supply
a mill. The publication of values arrived
at on dish concentrates of manganiferous
and titanic iron, tungstic ochre, etc., cries
for suppression.
The evolution of the bucket dredge is
interesting, but the economic limit must
sooner or later be reached. Kampong in
1914 started with an 80,000-yard dredge,
and not until 10 years later did Rawang
demonstrate its ability to dig and treat
1207000 yards a month. Stimulated by the
price, of tin, Malim Nawar South and Kuala
Kampar dredges were constructed a few
years; later and have put through 185,000
yards, per month. Dredges for Kampong
Lanjut find Ivramat are promised with a
200,000-yard capacity. Now, with the assist-
ance of American experts, dredges of 300,000
yards are to be constructed, and treatment
costs are estimated at under 3d. If success-
ful, they will open tremendous possibilities
and make large yardages of lib.-ground
highly profitable with tin as low as £2OO
per ton.
* # * *
Malayan returns for the first fortnight of
November show a slight falling off. In the
Austral Malay group, Kampong Kamunting
cleaned up 69,000 yards for 22 tons, or a
trifle over .76,1 b., per yard as against the
previous month’s .871 b. No. 2 dredge was
held up for 51 hours for boiler cleaning.
Asam Ivumbang lost 152 hours in renewing
a tumbler, but took 10 tons of t.o. from
20,000 c.y., thus averaging 1.21 b. to the yard
—a good return, but not up to the 1.151 b. of
the month before. Ula Yam’s average for
October was .491 b.; the November fortnight
returned 12 tons from (32,000 c.y., an aver-
age of a little over .461 b. Tliabawleik,
though winning 30 tons from 49,000 yards,
averaged only 1.471 b. for the half-month;
October’s figures wore 1.531 b. Karat re-
turned 34 tons from 162,000 yards, the
average of a little over .501 b. bettering the
October average of .421 b. The Rawang
return was from the dredge only (the floor,ed
sluicing plant is still de-watering), and
showed 10 tons from 50,000 yards, or .4blb.
per yard* The October average was .54.
In the Alluvial group, Malim Nawar’s 11
tons from 54,000 yards was almost on a par
with the previous month’s average of .481 b.
Malim Nawar South returned 20 tons from
80,000 yards, or .601 b. to the yard, bettering
October figures for the full jnonth (.501b.).
Ivundang, which returned ,651 b. to the yard
for October, had to be content with 13 tons
from 60,000 yards for the first half of
November, the average working out at
.621 b. Kuala Kampar’s return of 20 tons
from 85,000 yards was neck and neck will
the previous month’s average of under .571 b ,:
Tanjong Tualong slipped, getting, only 15
tons from 85,000 yards and averaging ,421 b.,
as against ,511 b. Jelapang improved, with 10
tons from 37,000 yards—,6slb. compared
with ,601 b. Takuapa’s figures were 22 tons
from 70,000 yards, roughly .751 b. as against
.711 b. for October.

The Malay Siamese shows have little of
interest to offer for the half-month. The
new pilot plant in the Phin Soon open cut,
though it ran only 165 hours after the
change over from the old plant, put through
10,000 c.y. for 10 tons of t.o. The recovery,
2.241 b. per yard, measures up to expecta-
tions, and when the plant is running full
time, as it should be by the end of tin:
month, recoveries will probably be still bet-
ter. The October yield was 2.181 b. to the
yard. Nawng Pet is in its usually over-
watered condition at this time of the year,
and the erection of the Haacl Yai dredge
only awaits a few parts.

THE COMPANY.
The Company was formed in July, 1926, to acquire the Com-
monwealth Patent Rights of the Hall Hydraulic Motor, and has
since been engaged in bringing to a state of marketable perfection
the present model Washing Machine driven by the Hall Motor. An
improvement to the original motor has been developed, the Com-
monwealth Patent Rights for which have been applied for. These
rights will be the property of the Company. In addition, several
unique features have been added to the machine.
PAST TRADING.
The first capital issue (£l 1,000) was limited to provide only
the capital necessary to purchase the various patents, perfect the
machine, and thoroughly test the market by—
(a) installing machines in a number of homes under ordi-
nary household conditions, and
(b) proving the demand for the machine by cash and
time-payment sales. After a 12 months’ trial the
Directors are satisfied that the estimates of trading and
profits given below are sound and moderate. They
are how in a position to recommend the investment
with confidence to the public.
REASONS FOR INCREASE OF CAPITAL.
The new capital is to be devoted to the purchase of stocks in
view of the apparent large and ready demand for the Washing
Machines, and to finance the sale of machines on the time-payment
plan. There are no bonus or promoters shares.
ESTIMATED PROFITS.
After a liberal allowance for all contingencies the Directoi3
estimate a net yearly profit of £l 4,000 on a turnover of 40 machines
per week. A full itemised statement and balance-sheet can be
perused at the Company’s offices, where any further information will
be given to intending investors.
The Company has the Patent Rights for the other States of
Australia under offer. A deposit has been paid on an option for
Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, the terms
of which it is not advisable to disclose in a Prospectus. Negotiations
are being conducted with another firm for the South Australian
rights. The purchase price of these patent rights represents over
60 per cent, of the capital now offered for subscription.

THE MACHINE.
The Wifesaver Washing Machine is operated by water,
the cheapest, simplest and strongest power known. This
power is obtained by connecting with the laundry water tap.
The hydraulic motor is exceedingly simple in construc-
tion and efficient in operation.
The fact that the Wifesaver boils the clothes as it washes
makes it the only machine on the Sydney market with this
essential advantage. The machine is made in gas or fuel
models.
Housewives appreciate its freedom from intricate
mechanical operation. Being non-electrical, there are no wires
to fuse, no motor to burn out, and no danger of shocks. A
half-turn of an ordinary water tap starts or stops the washer.
Clothes are washed, boiled, rinsed and blued without having
to be handled once. Delicate fabrics are washed without fear
of damage.
Independent engineers of repute endorse the finished
product, while testimonials and recommendations received
from users speak eloquently of the utility and the satisfaction
given in use.

THE MARKET.
Domestic labor-saving appliances which a few years ago were
unknown or considered luxuries are now deemed necessary in a
modern homes, and there are few articles to-day providing sue
volumes of trade as these.
Electric and gas-irons, radiators and electric toasters lilustra e
this. Vacuum cleaners have been selling in Sydney at the rate
of over 500 per month for the last two years, and show no sign o
diminishing business.
Difficulty in obtaining efficient laundry help has caused house-
wives to seek a remedy. High-priced, imported electric washing
machines are finding a ready market.
, The low price of the Wifesaver, combined with the easy pay-
ment plan of purchase, opens up an enormous market. In Sydney
and suburbs alone there are over 300,000 homes, and houses are
being erected at the rate of nearly 10,000 per year.
Architects and builders speak in the highest terms of the
machine, and it is being recommended by the one and installed
by the other. Valuable space is saved, as only one small tub is
required, and an efficient laundry can be built on an area of 5 feet
square. The saving effected in materials, space and labor is greater
than the cost of the machine.

Wifesaver Washing Machine at your showroom, and also at the
works of the manufacturers.
The machine is of sound design, and should operate at a
maximum of efficiency and economy with a minimum of power
consumption. Owing to the simplicity of its construction, its upkeep
should be remarkably low.
Yours very truly,
(Sgd.) JAMES VICARS.

J. B. Holme, left high and dry by the
abolition of the N.S.W. Board of Trade, is
not content to draw the £lOOO p.a. and
extras to which he is entitled for another
two years, but has asked to be allowed to
retire. Holme has been associated with
industrial affairs from the time when Wade
introduced the Disputes Act. He was chief
clerk under that Act and later Industrial
Magistrate, and he was Sydney registrar
under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act.
He qualified as a barrister in 1914 ; lie had
been a solicitor for a good many years before
that. His desire now is for freedom to chase
fees at the Bar. He is a brother of Pro-
fessor Holme, and has a passion for getting
things accurate to the millionth of an inch.
Which is one reason why his reports are
mostly pigeon-holed.
Ernest William Parlies, the new Clerk of
the House of Reps., should prove a reliable
guide to Mr. Speaker and the rank and file
of members, lie has risen from the bottom
The newly-appointed Clerk of the House
of Reps.
of the Federal Parliamentary clerical staff
and he knows forms and precedents from
A to Z. Outside the House his chief inter-
est is the Anglican Church and lie is a pillar
of the Canberra C.E.M.S. He tells with the
pride that springs from tolerance that the
opening of the local Methodist church was
advertised from the Anglican pulpit, and
that the R.C.’s lent their organ to the
Methodies to help them out.
Leslie Consett Stephen has been admitted
to practice as a solicitor in N.S.W. His
great-great-grandfather was John Stephen,
who was made a Judge of the N.S.W.
Supreme Court in 1825 and became Acting
Chief Justice; his great-grandfather,
Alfred, was Chief Justice from 1844 to
1872; his grandfather, Montagu Consett
Stephen, founded the Stephen, Jaques and
Stephen firm. Another member of the family,
Montagu’s brother, Matthew Henry Stephen,
was a Judge, and he, also, was Chief Jus-
tice for a term. A cousin of Leslie Stephen,
Alastair, who was admitted last year, was
the first fifth-generation member of the
family to take up the pursuit of Costs.
F. P. Evans, the Marine Court barrister
who is looking after the interests of Pilot
Carson, of the Tahiti, at the Greycliffe dis-
aster inquiry in Sydney, is a sailor turned
lawyer. He first went to sea 35 years ago,
and was in the Union Company’s ships for
some years. Evans was in charge of the
towing of Shackle-
ton’s Nimrod from
Lyttelton (M.L.)
to beyond the Ant-
arctic Circle, the
idea being to con-
serve the coal sup-
ply of the expedi-
tion’s ship. He
brought back Pro-
iessor David,
Douglas Mawson
and Dr. Mackay
when the trio
made their trip to
the South Mag-
netic Pole. Pro-
moted to marine
superintendent of
the Union Co. in
London, Evans
began reading for
the Bar. He was
called at the
Middle Temple in
1920 and admitted
to the N.S.W. Bar
in 1921.
ROY GOLLAX,
the new con-
troller of Vic.
Tourist Bureau.
The Redemptorist Order of Missioners
lost one of their star men when P. M. Lynch
passed away. Born in Maoriland, he joined
up with the secular clergy at first in Dun-
edin 45 years ago, and when Bishop Moran,
who wore the mitre there, died he was
expected to be the popular choice. However,
honors didn’t come his way, and presently
he joined up with the C.S.S.R. order. When
the Redemptorists took over in the Philip-
pine Islands he was superior there for several
years, an office he had held in many houses
of the order.
Frank Lavender, the well-known N.S.W.
and Victorian stock and station agent, passed
out with The Bulletin in his hands. A
bosom friend of racehorse-owner Ben Chaffey,
and himself an owner of many prads which
race at country meetings, he had just heard
that his sketch was included in Tom
Glover’s group of Cup-time celebrities. One
of his clerks brought him a copy and Death
touched his shoulder while he was scanning
the page.
Dr. Ivatzenelenbogenstein, a Central Euro-
pean historian and savant, made a special
trip to England to address the Jewish His-
torical Society upon his pet subject: that
the Earl of Essex. Queen Elizabeth’s fav-
orite, was really a Jew of the name of Isaacs
and that Bess would have accepted him as
consort if his conscience as a .Tew would have
allowed him to marry her. The doctor with
the name like an earthquake in the alpha-
bet produced papers which he said proved
that the matter was considered by the Beth
Din (a sort of Jewish Synod), which con-
ducted its affairs in secret —Jews at the time
being legally barred from Britain.
Edward S. O. Howard, wiio writes occa-
sionally on Melbourne’s early history, was
born in the southern village in April, 1839.
The near-nonagenarian is a son of Commis-
sary Howard, who served under Captain
Lonsdale, Port Phillip’s first Chief Magi-
strate and “Commissioner-in-Chief of the
Military Forces.” Edward Howard is prob-
ably the oldest living Victorian.
“O.P.II.”: Watching Irvine, Vic.’s C. J.,
presiding in the Practice Court the other
day my mind went back a quarter of a cen-
tury to the time when, following his vic-
tory at the State elections, he was having
liis first free week-end. That poll was the
outcome of the penal dissolution which
Irvine induced Governor Clarke to grant
following a set-back in the Assernbly on a
retrenchment proposal. Irvine’s predecessor
as C.J. (John Madden) officiated at the
preliminary ceremony of inaugurating the new
session. Few of the “heads” of that day
survive. Gillies, who was elected Speaker
(Mason having been defeated at the poll),
died in the following year. Wrixon, who
was President of the Upper House, followed
him about a decade later, and Madden
claimed his cemetery lot and made way for
Irvine on the Bench in 1918.
Lord Loughborough, whose second dive into
the bankruptcy court has been chronicled in
the cables, married a Sydney girl who sub-
sequently divorced him. Loughborough’s old
man, now the Earl of Rosslyn, had much the
same harrowing experiences, though he must
have had some luck at the tin hares, since
the cable adds that he recently paid £20,000
to settle his son’s debts. In his earlier days
Loughborough, sen., took to the stage for a
living, being one of the original cast of
Pinero’s “Trelawney of the • Wells.” Then
he figured as a war correspondent and the
inventor of a system for breaking Monte
Carlo —the system broke before the bank.
The Earl had brains or luck or both; liis
heir apparently hasn’t an over-supply of
either.
Arthur Coningham, old-time cricketer, has
been pushed into the limelight again by
news of an inheritance from a grandparent.
Coningham was being looked for in Maori-
land. He spent many years in the Shivery
Isles after his sensational divorce case, but
he has been living in Sydney in between
spells from rabbit trapping. Coningham
was a freakish cricketer who rivalled Briggs
in making humor on the crkket field. He
once lit a fire of twigs in the outfield on an
English oval to warm himself. An incident
in his life not generally known was his
resctie of two people from drowning in the
soupy waters of the Thames. •
Perth University will benefit to the extent
of probably £60,000 by the will of Robert
John Gleddon —the estate is to accumulate
for 10 y-sars. Gleddon’s first Australian
experience was as a surveyor in Queensland,
but lie crossed to W.A. in time for the gold
boom. He made the preliminary of
Coolgardie, and laid out the sits of Kal-
goorlie, incidentally getting in on some good
gold propositions, the basis of the fortune
which goes to help higher education in the
West.
Seventy-five years ago when Robert Cecil,
afterwards Marquis of Salisbury and Prime
Minister of Britain, was on a visit to Vic.
he stayed at a pub in Flinders-lane, near
Collins-place, then called Steplien-street.
Many years ago the pub was delicensed, and
it was used for any old purpose till it was
pulled down. Now the land holds a modern
factory, and a memorial-stone has ty>en
built in with an inscription about Cecil’s
patronage of the hostelry that was. Farmer
and ex-timber-worker Hogan occupies as Pre-
mier in Vic. Assembly the seat allotted the
present Marquis when he attended a con-
ference on immigration last year.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : In Perivale Church,
a couple of miles from Ealing (Eng.), is a
memorial window to Henry Condell, “first
Mayor of Melbourne and first member of
the first Legislative Council in Victoria.”
Was Condell the first member, or is it an
error in duplication? Marcus Clqrke’s his-
tory gives the date as 1842, and he spells
the name Clundell. Shakspeareans will recau
the Elizabethan actor Henry Condell, to
whom Shakspeare bequeathed a ring. If the
Melbourne mayor was a descendant, did the
ring ever get to Australia?
Justice Duffy, of the High Court, at 75
wears as well as his former County Court
contemporary, Justice McArthur, of Vic.
Supreme Court, who must be nearly 10 years
younger. Thirty-seven years ago they were
in all the principal County Court cases. It
must have seemed a long way then to a
superior court bench, for Federation was
only in the air. Both Duffy and McArthur
got their chances for the judiciary late in
life.
The ghost of all the dead and gone ’bus
horses in Melbourne might have mustered at
the funeral of Tom Foley, who laid down the
ribbons the other day. Seventy-two years
ago Melbourne was a fledgling to the new
arrival from Dublin, who pioneered the horse
’bus and prospered exceedingly. For 30
years he was chairman of the Carlton
bench of Beaks. The old Jehu had scored
90 when death called.
Dr. George Horne, the Melbourne surgeon,
was a victim of his life’s hobby of ethnology.
The strain of an expedition to Central Aus-
tralia began the decline which ended in his
death. Cambridge University was envious of
his collection of Binghi’s domestic and war-
like implements, and did its darnedest to get
them, but the patriotic medico presented it
to the Commonwealth.
Sydney University went abroad for its
Director of Cancer Research; G. Marshal]
Findlay is coming from Scotland to take
up his duties early next year. Findlay, who
as a young man got his degrees in time to
be appointed aide-medicin in the Belgian
Army Service Corps, has been lecturer in
pathology at the Edinburgh University, and
for the past four years has devoted himself
entirely to cancer research.
Religion ran strongly in the O’Brien
family in County Clare, Ireland. Six
brothers and two sisters entered the service
of the Church. The death of Francis
Thomas O’Brien, a pioneer of the Christian
Brothers in Australia, means the loss of a
notable member of the family. Waterford and
Drogheda were liis early fields, but Aus-
tralia attracted him in 187 S. Opening col-
leges was his specialty—Adelaide first, then
Melbourne till Bananaland secured him in
1892 to open up Nudgee, Brisbane’s big R.C.
College.
Australia’s stock of Y.C.’s is to be added
to. Sergeants William Angus and Thomas
Caldwell are on their way from Scotland to
Queensland. Caldwell gained his cross at
Oudenarde, the scene of one of Marl-
borough’s victories over 200 years earlier.
Armed with a Lewis gun Caldwell cap-
tured a strong-post and 18 prisoners
single-handed. Angus was awarded the bit
of gunmetal for rescuing a wounded mate
under heavy fire at Givenchy. Other deco-
rations received on that occasion were 40
wounds from the fragments of an eneihy
bomb.
The foundation-stone of the first Prince’s
bridge has turned up in the possession of
H. A. Bussell, sec. of the Fitzroy Cricket
Club. The ston e was laid by La Trobe in
1846, and the fact that the bridge was a
private enterprise probably explains why
the relic has drifted into private hands. If
the City Council had the courage to charge
for the use of the present structure at the
rate of the original toll it could pay off
the national debt. Loaded drays paid half
a crown, gigs a shilling and pedestrians two-
pence every time they crossed it.
Lawyers are no longer sacrosanct in Vic.
Parliament. When the Estate- and Business-
Agents Bill was before the Assembly the
other day Morley, the man from Barwon,
moved that lawyers be included as sub-agents
to whom the measure could be made applic-
able. Blackburn, one of the two Labor legal
lights, supported the amendment, and Slater,
Labor Attorney-General, who was in charge
of the measure, opposed it. Only five mus-
tered for the noes on a division. Time was
when there were 16 of the Devil’s brigade in
the Assembly and at least half a dozen in
the Uppah Chambah. Now the total for both
Houses is five —one barrister (Cohen,
M. and four solicitors —Lawson, Snow-
ball (Speaker), Slater and Blackburn,
M’s.L.A.
Barrister S. E. Lamb’s grandfather was
Capt. John Lamb, M.L.C., one of Sydney’s
early overseas merchants. The firm was
known as Lamb, Parbury and Co. The bar-
rister’s father, J. de V. Lamb, having no
taste for trade, acquired the famous Boomoo
Boomoo station, ogu the Liverpool Plains of
N. whereon until its sale to J. M.
Allison he bred aristocratic jumbucks. The
law-soaked K.C. likes the land, and is happy
and at home when at work on his model
sheep-farm near Young.
Sir Apirana Ngala, Member of Parliament
for the Eastern Maori electorate for
the past 22 years.
If Ross Lawson, a 16-year-old fourth-
form boy of the Broken Hill High School,
gets the encouragement lie deserves, the
world may acquire further enlightenment on
the brain and its functioning. Young Law-
son has read deeply on the subject. His
teachers were so impressed with the boy’s
learning that they persuaded him to give a
lecture before the local Workers’ Educa-
tional Association.

Nothing like it in the World
With the completion of a four year development and
building programme, Hudson and Essex each present an
entirely new line of bodies and an entirely new chassis
that gives new meaning to motor-car performance.
The Super-Six principle, long held in check, is released
to its full capacity.
That required chassis specially designed to permit full
expression of its wider, more flexible and nimble power.
It meant greater roadability; and a driving and riding ease
not heretofore known. It meant a reliability and sturdiness
that would meet uninterrupted and sustained performance
at top speed for any period of time.
Riding That is Like Flying.
In both Hudson and Essex, you will note at once, and always
remember, an effortless ease in all performance, that can
never be confused with any other car. It is the exclusive
characteristic of the Super-Six principle. Power is so
smoothly delivered in all ranges of performance that you
are scarcely conscious of it. You take the lead at the
getaway, you dart in and around traffic, or you travel all
day at sustained high speed, with only the way you out-
distance others to tell your supremacy. There is no sense
of mechanical effort, no explosive lunge of power, either
in your flashing getaway or in any phase of this flexible
performance.
The bodies are of such variety and beauty as will satisfy
all demands for luxury and exclusiveness as well as comfort
and price advantage.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
ON THE SAME JOB.
DAVE “’Aving a day in the bush, mate?”
THE OTHET: “Yuss, I’m searching for inspiration in the heart of nature.”
DAVE: “Cripes, we both got the same job on. I’m after a roan ’eifer.”
“Oodnadatta”: Mount Sarah station
(S.A.) has been visited by an army of grass-
hoppers —not remarkable considering that the
drought has broken, but remarkable on
account of the grasshoppers themseKes.
They are gorgeous things of varied hues—
some of them vivid scarlet Avith brown and
yellow backs and shirt-fronts of silver and
orange ; others Avith magenta coats trimmed
with gold and blue stripes and (usually)
flesh-colored hose. The things are of all
sizes and shapes, from babies an eighth of
an inch long to grandfathers measuring
inches. Their fine colors do not make them
any less voracious than their drab relatives
of former years: they can soon clean up a
bed of lettuce or cabbage. Have they been
seen in similar array in other parts of Aus-
tralia, or are Ave especially favored?
!<! * * *
“J.H.S.”: If “N.G.” (E. 20/10/’27) takes
the trouble to read my par. (B. 15/9/'27)
again he will find that I did not refer to
cudgerie (Flindcrsia scliottiana) as “crow's
ash.” What I did say was that cudgerie in
some parts of Bananaland is knoAvn as
crow’s ash, a name by which I myself knew
the timber until I avus set right some years
back. Not only is the handsome cudgerie
knoAvn to settlers and timber-getters in
some parts as cvoav's ash. but I know of at
least one saw-milling company that accepted
and paid for the timber by that name.
With regards to “flandoAvser,” this is the
designation by Avhicli the true ctoav’s ash
(Flindersia australis) is knoAvn by most
timber-getters on the coast of Bananaland,
and I have also heard it applied to the cud-
gerie. I agree with “N.G.” that unless some-
thing is done to propagate the trees in ques-
tion their extinction must occur at no distant
date.
* * # *
“Rob P.” A bush pal who has to deal with
stinging-trees every day of his life reckons
that the curative properties of the cunjevoi
(B. 6/10/’27) are mythical. His remedy is
to immediately scorch the hair from the
affected part with a match and apply methy-
lated spirit. The flame burns the stinging
spines level Avith the skin and the spirit
counteracts whatever poison is left. I have
tried this remedy and have found it fairly
effective.
“Old Timer” : If you run foul of the sting-
ing-tree knock a piece of bark off it and
nib the sappy side on the affected part;
you Avill have relief at once. Other bush
hints worth noting are that the root of the
stinging-nettle relieves its sting, and if a bee
stabs you common bracken root bruised and
rubbed on will fix you up. Soldier-, bull-
and all other ant stings can be relieved by
nicotine from your pipe.
* * * *
“Walkabout”: Recent artistic aspersions
on an aged and honorable calling (I refer
particularly to B. 6/10/’27) prompt me to
rush to its defence. I have had 30 years’
experience of bullocks and their ways, and in
only one instance have I seen a single-
handed whip used by an ox-conductor—and
he had a withered arm. He still works on
the Cooyar Range (S.Q.). Two other
drivers I knew AA r ere one-armed men, in each
case a short stump remaining. They used
the long-handled whip, holding the end of the
handle against their ribs Avith the stump.
They used it expertly and managed their
teams and loads like other drivers. Yoking-
up, however, was beyond them, as they could
not hold the bow in the yoke and insert the
key with one hand.
HER CHANCE.
“I don’t believe in drink, and, you’ve had too much already.”
“Yes, lady; I believe if you was to give me another one it would sicken me off it for
the rest of my life.”
“AdeL.” : In the Gulf country lives a little
brown warbler —a delightful songster and
the most friendly bird in the bush. It feeds
exclusively on flies and similar insects, is
stationary in habits, seldom wandering more
than half a mile from its habitat, and is
always found near permanent water. Many
times I have pitched my camp in the
secluded territory of a pair of these little
fellows. From the first they make them-
selves at home flying in and out of the tent.
At dawn they flit to our bunks and carol
till ws get up; then they feast on the mos-
quitoes in and around our nets. Later they
will sit on a near-by post or stump and
pipe delightful songs. “Little darlings” is
the name by which bushmen know them.
* * * *
“X.N.0.”: Deaf Bill (B. 3/11/’27) Avas
lucky in having succeeded with his execution
of six head-hunters, considering the crude
way he went about it. Without a proper
galloAvs and trap the “yard-arm” method,
used of old in the Navy, is the
only one that commends itself to me.
This consisted of reeving a rope through
a block on the yard-arm, putting a noose in
one end of it round the delinquent’s neck, and
a sheep-shank, with the upper bight secured
only by a yarn, in the portion of the rope
between the Auctim and the yard-arm. When
a dozen lusty sailors on the other end ran
away Avith it the subject of the proceedings
was jerked off his feet; the yarn, on reach-
ing the block, carried arvay, allowing the
sheep-shank to come adrift and drop the
corpse the length of the rope used in the
sheep-shank.
“Bihai”: I am rather sceptical about
Deaf Bill’s achievement. If “Plumper Line”
means the Tugeri tribe, these Avild men from
Dutch NeAV Guinea constantly raided the
border into B.N.G. Regularly they came on
the tail end of the n.-w. season and were
blown swiftly home at the beginning of the
s.s. Sir William Maegregor, knowing this,
met them in the launch Ruby, and the
deaths amongst them occurred from the rifles
of the police, not by the rope. Larry Peter-
son, sailmaker of the Merrie England, was
the man Avho earned the fivers for any
scraggings that were going. Later, Avhen
he left the ship and started in business in
Port Moresby, hs still officiated as Jack
Ketch. At last he refused the hangman 3
job. “The blokes in Tom McCrann’s pub
are insultin’,” he groAvlcd. “they call me
Nosey Bob’ ” —the Sydney official of the
period. Since Larry’s time only one man
has volunteered for the gruesome task. He
was a prisoner who couldn’t pay his fine for
shooting birds of paradise and reckoned
the fiver would be handy on his release,
lie bragged -of his nerve until the last
minute, then squibbed.
* * * *
“V.H.R.” : Though worms and grubs form
the main items of the duckbill’s tucker,
“M.L.C.” (B. 27/10/’27) is not right in his
assumption that plats, are too slow to catch
fish, small ones, anyhow\ I have seen them
feeding on the whitebait which frequent Tas.
rivers in millions from September to Febru-
ary; it is surprising how agile they can be
when in search of tucker. But it is not so
much the destruction of small fish as of
spawn that the Fisheries Commissioners com-
plain of. Probably the plats, are not guiltless
in this direction. I am satisfied, however,
that the harm they do is a fleabite compared
with what trout inflict.
* * *• *
“Titun”: The blackbird seems to have
made itself far more at home in Victoria
than the skylark. A few years ago it was
practically unknown in Gippsland ; now its
rollicking note can be heard in most parts
of that province. Like the skylark, it
appears, to be spreading along the coast
first and then working its w T ay inland.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: Cockatoos, black or
white, will rip chunks out of trees (B.
20/10/’27). In the big-timber country of
Groperland I reared a black specimen whose
head was equipped Avith a beak that defied
wire netting and wooden cages. Having at
last got full-up of having bits pulled out
of the house and furniture, I boxed the de-
structive beggar up and consigned him to a
friend in Perth who had admired his color-
ing. During the train-trip he ate his way
through his carrier, and, screaming like a
tortured devil, escaped out of the brake-van
door into the bush. Five days afterwards
I woke up and found him in my wheat-bin
—he had made a new place of entry at the
side. It was his last outrage; a few minutes
after discovery he met his fate under the
axe on the woodheap.

THE STATION BULLOCK-DRAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s the dray that's always wanted where
there’s heavy work to do,
Where the ways are rough and rugged, like
itself.
That has blazed the tracks that thread the
bush, and crossed some rivers, too ;
It’s the bit of gear that’s never “on the
shelf.”
All the slabs we split for building, all the
grey grass that we cut
For the lean days when the horses needed
hay,
All the fencing for the paddocks, and the
wood for camp and hut,
Have been carried on the station bullock-
dray.
Though it stands 'out in the open where the
handyman decrees,
And of paint and tar its ancient wheels
are bare ;
Though it wobbles over rocky hills and
bumps a thousand trees,
It is rarely that it gets a craftsman’s care.
Long it was our trusty storesliip, trekking by
lone camps and dams,
And it brought the mails as well from
faraway ;
But we weren’t in a hurry, and Ave had no
telegrams,
When our carriage was the station bullock-
dray.
It has never tasted aught but grease to speed
it to and fro,
Nor has borne a name upon its battered
side,
Since it brought us out to settle here so
many years ago,
When the bush around was trackless, wild
and wide.
It is loose in all its bolts and joints, and
eA’ery bar is bent;
Its decking’s mostly lost or gone astray;
But there’s naught that jolts and rattles
where our bushland days are spent
That can rough it like the station bullock-
dray.

This modern “Ice-
man” calls once —
with Frigidaire—and
the ice stays always!
—that because of the constant, icy-
cold atmosphere of Frigidaire, hard-
to-keep foods preserve their fresh-
ness, purity and flavor for surprising
lengths of time —some even improve
in the keeping.
—-that Frigidaire brings a new free-
dom-freedom from the need of con-
stant planning—freedom from the
trouble of frequent marketing— free-
dom from the uncertainty of an out-
side ice supply.
—that while no home could enjoy a
greater luxury than is afforded by
Frigidaire electric refrigeration, its
first cost is surprisingly low, its run-
ning cost is usually much lower than
ice and it practically eliminates food
wastage.
—that only genuine Frigidaire will
provide all these advantages.
1. Complete and permanent independence
of outside ice supply.
2. Uninterrupted service—proved by the
experience of more than 300,000 users
—more than ail other electric refrigera-
tors combined.
3. A food compartment that is 12° colder
without ice—temperatures that keep
foods fresh.
4. Direct frost-coil cooling and self-sealing
tray fronts giving a dessert and ice-
making compartment always below
freezing.
5. Beautiful metal cabinets designed, built
and insulated exclusively for electric
refrigeration.
6. An operating cost that is surprisingly
low.
7. Value only made possible by quantity
production, General Motors’ purchasing
power and G.M.A. terms.
Please send me Booklet “B,” giving complete infor-
mation about Frigidaire Electric Refrigeration.

“Kai Kai”: Curious forms of communism
are found among the natives of the South
Seas. Almost every race practises common-
ownership in some direction. In the Gilbert
Islands it is asserted by the use of the
word “Bu-aba-gee.” Thus Taprami, coming
home from a season in the plantations of
the Marshall Group, brought with him a
bicycle. As soon as the owner wheeled it
off the wharf, Rabati touched it, crying
“Bu-aba-gee.” Immediately he became half-
owner of the machine. Taprami knew pro-
test was useless, so he bided his time.
Rabati was a clever boat-builder. In secret
he put together a fine catamaran of redwood.
As the builder launched the craft Taprami
rushed up and,, going through the com-
munistic ritual, became its half-owner. To
whites the singular feature of this business
is that it is practised with reserve and seems
rarely to lead to abuse.
**• * *
“C.A.8.”: I am reminded by “Wang’s”
par (B. 27/10/’27) of the far-off day when I
set out to rob a fire-tail finch couple of
their downy youngsters. Before I had gone
30 yards from the nest with my little
captives the mother circled a couple of times
in the air and then dropped dead at my feet.
A moment later her husband did the same.
Finally, as though aware of what had hap-
pened, the two young birds fluttered out of
existence before I reached home. I never
robbed a nest of its young or even of an
egg from that day 1 . The little tragedy
struck home.
* * * *
“Old Gum” : The variety of N.-Queensland
reptile known locally as the “black python”
exceeds the usual length of snakes, reaching
to about 11 feet, with a girth of nine inches.
The head is small and flat and of a dull
black color; the rest of the body is a blackish
tan. Unlike most large snakes the “python”
is a lively customer. Recently my dog killed
a number of them, but one morning struck
one too large to shake, and died in less than
half an hour, although this chap is reported
to be non-venomous.
s*: 5 * : * ❖ ❖
“Carisbrook, Jun.” : What we call “native
bread” (B. 20/10/’27) in N.Q. is neither
a fungus nor the hardened sap from a tree.
THE PROMISE OF REFORM.
PRISONER TO POLICEMAN: Say, put it up to the beak, will yer, that if he finds ma
innerccnt I’ll turn over a new leaf.”
It is a fruit, resembling a cocoanut, though
much larger; it grows profusely on stunted
trees, with fan-shaped palm-leaves, under
which the fruit matures. Loaves up to
121 b. are common. Natives regard them
as a stand-by if the meat supply fails
* * * *
“Gouger”: Three reptiles hitherto un-
known to Australia have recently been
unearthed in the
big hills of Moa
and Badu islands.
One is a flying
goanna, a green
beastie with parch-
ment - like skin
under its forearms.
It leaps overhead
from a tree, with
outstretched paws,
and its substitute
for wings volplanes
it to the desired
object. The natives
say that when
climbing the steep
mountain tracks
they keep a wary
eye on ail near-by
trees. Should they
spot one of these
flying lizards they
keep their eyes on
it until well past
the tree, as under
the stare of a man
it never moves ; but
should the traveller
unwarily look else-
where he has just
time to hear a faint
hiss before the
creature has fast-
ened sharp claws in
his back. There are
many species of
this lizard in the
Indo-Malay regions,
but I have always
understood them to
be harmless.
Another novelty is
a small snake with
a highly - polished
skin which can run
forward or back-
ward with equal
ease. The third
curiosity is also a
snake ; of this it is
related that when it
bites a man it
clings to h'm with
its head whilst the
body wriggles away.
Evidently a gecko.
A missionary has
recently collected
and bottled a speci-
men of each.
MAKING THE BEST OF IT.
“I hear poor old Bill Smith’s missus cleared out last Tuesday.
’Ow’s 'e fakin’ it?”
“Oh, lie’s beerin’ up very well so far.”
“Mullarula”: One of Black Brother's
mythical enemies is the ngooroi mullion, or
emu-eaglehawk, a submarine bird which lives
under the waters of the Lachlan and drags
down swimmers who give him a chance. No
abo. will swim near any of the haunts of
the ngooroi mullion, but I have noticed that
the places pointed out as such are always
sharp bends where snags lie in wait and
under-currents are likely to get in their
deadly work.
* * * *
“Momokeni”: Let me tell “V.E.” (B.
20/10/'27) that the animal described by me
was not a cuseus. The cus-
cus, or New Guinea opossum,
varies in color from dark or
light grey to a yellowish
mottled brown, sometimes
with the usual belly “yolk”
so spread through the fur as
to make it light yellow. One
weighing 121 b. or 151 b. would
be a monster. “Mary” and
the animal shot on Mt. Law-
son would weigh as much as
three of the largest cuscuses
I have ever seen, and were
also dissimilar in respect of
color, shape and habits. Inci-
dentally, it is not a preroga-
tive of chieftainship to wear
the skin of a cuseus, the com-
monest method of using this
adornment being by taking
rings from the tail of the
animal, alive or dead, and
using them as finger rings.
I have rescued many a poor
cuseus from the knives of
natives and kept them until
the call of the bush lured
them back to the jungle
again. These furry rings are also slipped
over the ends of the bows as ornaments,
whilst the strips of fur are usually strung-
through the hole in the lobe of the ear and
worn as dangling ornaments.
* * *
“F.W.W.”: “You young blokes don’ know
wot it is to have a mob rush,” said the old
hand. “I remember the time I was doin’
a dry stage down the Ninety-mile Beach
with a mob from the Ord. The tide was
right out—it goes out miles along there—
an' the mob was mad L-r a drink. Smellin’
the sea, they gives one beller and off. I
was too busy tryin’ to block ’em to notice
the fog cornin’. First thing I know it’s on
us, an’ you can’t see your hand in front of
your face. By this time we was in the
water. Me horse is swimmin’ and I’m strik-
in’ lights on the horns of the bullicks along-
side tryin’ to get a peep at the lead. I
didn’t know whether we was movin’ out to
sea or back to land, an’ the waves was
slappin’ the back of me neck. Sharks?
Thousands of ’em! Presently one gets me
horse and leaves me in the water.” The
old hand pressed the bowl of his pipe, gazed
in the fire, and resumed. “By the luck o'
things, one of them big green-backed turtles
comes swimmin’ by jist as the fog was liftin'.
I jumps on his back, makes a halter with
me whip, and w'eels ’em back to the beach.
Landed ’em at Geraldton 10 over the num-
ber. Great days, them!”
* * * *
“X3X”: Albinos are not as rare in the
’roo kingdom as “X2X” (B. 27/10/’27) evi-
dently supposes. For months a white ’roo
tantalised several old trappers in the Broken
Hill district. Finally it was shot, and its
remains are to be seen at the Burra Hotel,
Kooringa (S.A.). It was pure white with
pink eyes.
* * * $
“Yohn”: The belief that snakes are sus-
ceptible to the charms of music is a myth.
Ive lived all my life in the bush, and
although I’ve jambed an accordion, blown
a mouth-organ,' piped a tin-whistle and filed
at a fiddle for hours at a time in the
snakiest of surroundings, I have never seen
anything to support the widespread belief
that snakes have a musical ear. My own
opinion is that when snakes act in an
unusual manner in the presence of a musi-
cian in action it is the peculiar movements
of the performer that attract him, and not
the sounds produced.
* * * *
“The Welkin”: After watching the de-
spised shag at work I am convinced that he
is an artist. Firstly he dives, and in shallow
water one gets an idea of his speed when
submerged. He makes fishing look easy.
Usually he plays for the head, but occasion-
ally ho takes them anyhow. In the latter
case the bird rises to the surface and, spin-
ning the fish in the air, catches it head first.
Perhaps he like the fins pressed down so as
not to injure his throat when he’s swallowing
them.
DANNY BYRNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I camped beneath the Lachlan bridge, bard
by Condobolin,
And felt a mighty willingness to pass my
marble in;
Hungry and sore —though scarce eighteen I’d
hoofed it from the Loo—
When someone camped across from me yelled,
“ ’Ave a bit o’ stoo?”
lie was a thick, red-headed chap, bow-legged
and busliy-browed,
His hands were barcoo-rotted and his shoul-
ders labor-bowed;
He filled me up with tea and stew for nothing
in return,
And to my “Thank you, Mister” said “Me
name is Danny Byrne.”
He heard my history and said, “Yer gills
looked pretty white,
I thought per’aps it wouldn’t ’urt yer if yer
’ad a bite”;
He told me he was liglitin’ out next day for
Bogan Gate,
And said if that should be my way he
“wouldn't mind a mate.”
And so we footed it next day, old Danny
Byrne and I.
Along a dusty strip of hell beneath a grilling
sky;
Nor would he let me cadge the scran when
cash was hard to earn,
He’d say, “I’m broken in, me boy, no need
fer you ter learn.”
When now and then we struck a job that
gave a scanty cheque,
It went into a money wire and not down
Danny’s neck.
He never told me of his past, or where the
money went,
Although one day he said to me, “Me life
is nearly spent.”
Sometimes he’d tell me, “When yer die yer
gotter answer straight
To Him wot made yer for ther way y’ve
treated ev’ry mate.
For all of us ’as loads ter ’ump, no matter
wot we do,
An’ if yer tries ter ’elp yer mates the Lord’ll
’elp yer through.
"In fact, He’ll ’elp yer if yer don’t, but you
won’t feel the same
As wot yer will do if yer stick to playin’
of the game;
For there is somethin’ in a bloke that tells
’im wot is wrong
An’ wot is right, an’ right’s the thing that
makes yer life a song.”
And so old Danny’d sit and talk beside the
camp-fire blaze.
And this I know, his simple creed has helped
to mould my ways ;
And if, when i have crossed the range a
guerdon I should earn,
1 know I’ll owe a lot of it to dear old Danny
Byrne.
For eighteen months we padded it, with odd
jobs in between,
Till out by Lake Cargellico Dan left the
earthly scene ;
He barged into a burning pub, careless of
life or limb,
To save a drunken sleeper—and the bushmen
buried him.
Now 7 Time has made me many friends and
hallowed many scenes,
And memory indulgently to scores of com-
rades leans ;
But to no earthly pilgrimage more yearn-
ingly I turn
Than that dry tramp across the West with
dear old Danny Byrne.

entirely new design, brings each of its five .22 Long-Rifle cartridges exactly into line with the
breech when the bolt is pulled back. Double Extractors grip the rim of the shell as it rises from
the magazine, and holding it firmly feed it in a perfectly straight line into the close-fitting
chamber.
When the breech is closed the Bullet is seated right into the grooves of the rifling, ready to
take its spinning flight the instant the trigger is pressed. This means that there is no pre-
liminary “jump” as it leaves the mouth of the shell, and the bore being completely sealed, every
ounce of pressure is exerted against the base of the bullet. The result is superb accuracy, and
the full energy of the particular cartridge used.
These Special Features Are Found in No Other .22 Sporting Rifle.
A leaflet illustrating this weapon, and fully describing its sights, action, etc., will
be sent on request.

ABOUT BEEF BREEDS.
“Almanac” : Let me tell “Old Timer” (B.
27/10/’27) that I observed the orange-
colored fat of the Jersey at the abattoirs. This
coloring is characteristic of the breed and is
emphasised even in the brownish richness of
the cream. In Jersey they view with grave
suspicion any beast that doesn’t show this
orange fat when killed, and they regard
white fat as objectionable.
“Old Timer’s” theory that the orange color
A noticeable in any fat beast that has been
half starved for a few weeks is utterly
wrong. The fat of a beast in that condition
is a “foxy” color —a dirty reddish hue, and
in no way remembles the fat of the Jersey.
The cause of other cattle occasionally show-
ing an orange tint in the fat is feeding on
dandelions and such herbage among the,
grass.
“Old Timer’s” argument regarding the
smallness of the Jersey’s appetite might be
applied with greater truth to the Dexter
Kerry, but I haven’t met the man w T ho would
call this tiny creature a beef breed, and as
for living on gum-leaves, what about the milk
taint? I’ve tried milk from a turnip-rationed
cow and the flavor was just as distinct as in
the case of an onion diet, but gum-leaves—
not for mine! If your business is pro-
ducing beef, stick to the beef breeds and
leave the Jersey to the cow-cocky. The
Black poly and the Hereford are better
doers than most in cold places, while the
Shorthorn thrives in the milder climes.
Don’t despise the cross between any or all
of these breeds, for frequently they fatten
faster than the pure-bred, and are all
splendid beef beasts.
DECENTRALISED KILLING.
“ Sky rider” : “Chump Chop” (B. 3/11/’27)
will get plenty of support in his crusade
against the centralising of killing if he goes
to the country. But there will be strong
opposition in certain quarters. For years
the Goulburn (N.S.W.) Chamber of Com-
merce has been advocating exactly the
measures suggested by “Chump Chop,” and
the proposal to kill sheep and cattle in the
districts where they are raised has been put
before the Railway Commissioners and the
late Labor Government. The scheme met
with chilling criticism, and the Goulburn City
Council then decided to build its own abat-
toirs. When these are in working order it
is probable that any surplus meat will be sent
to Sydney. In that case, discriminating
metropolitan meat-eaters will certainly rush
the country killed product. But vested inter-
ests at Ilomebush will put up a stiff fight
against the change, and it will only become
practicable when city householders give it
their full support. The trouble is that many
Sydney folk don’t know good meat when
they see it.
THE “TOUGH” COW.
“Yufu”: Carelessness and bad milking
are more responsible for “tough” cows than
heredity is (“L’Fou,” B. 3/11/’27). A
heifer should always be milked by a strong-
wristed milker —one who can force a thick
stream from her. This opens the valve and
makes it pliable. And the teats should
never be moistened with milk. Always wash
th.e beast’s udder and teats with cold wrnter
before commencing to milk, and smear on a
little petroleum jelly. The jelly softens the
teats and protects them from cracking. But
I agree with “L’Fou” about improving
teats by breeding. Especially the Ayrshires
—who are cursed with small teats.
BETTER CHEESE WANTED.
“Titun”: Much has been done by Yic.
co-operative butter factories to improve the
standard of butter, but the same cannot be
said of cheese. Periodically there is a cam-
paign to increase the consumption of cheese,
but the essential to success is absent. A
purchaser cannot rely on getting a uniform
article. Sometimes the stuff is fully
matured, sometimes it is new and “soapy.”
The hig co-operative distributing concerns
should exert themselves to standardise the
quality. The rest wdll follow.
SCHOOL PIG CLUBS.
“Dinnis” : The sweet uses of the pig have
been gaining recognition in Australia of late
years. In Queensland they believe in rousing
interest early, and primary school pig clubs
are becoming a feature of country schools.
Each member of the club selects 1 his pig, and
henceforth care and feeding are in his hands.
Before judging day the homes of. the youth-
ful pig proprietors are visited and sties, runs,
etc., carefully inspected. At the judging,
marks are given for type and quality, in-
crease in weight, cost of production, sanita-
tion of sties, health of pig, interest shown
by owner, and arrangements made for mar-
keting. Further points are awarded for an
essay by each competitor on how he picked,
managed and fed his pig, and for the market
value of the beast and his merit as a bacon
pig. In a recent competition at Marburg, an
old German settlement in Southern Queens-
land, the kiddies paraded 123 pigs, and the
owner of tli e winning porker, besides collect-
ing a gold medal for his pet, also received
£4 Is. 4d. for him, the top price at that
week’s sale.
A PROLIFIC SOW.
“Coot”: Traralgon (Vic.) boasts of a sow
wdiicli in nine years has borne 235 offspring.
Her largest litter was IG, and her smallest
eight. For seven years in succession she had
tw y o litters yearly, in 1921 adding 31 to the
pig census.
SCRUB FEEDING.
“Mullarula” : It is quite true, as “N.M.L.”
(B. 20/10/’27) says, that all scrubs are
likely to cause impaction when fed to stock.
His suggestion of giving the animals a laxa-
tive lick is a good one, but plenty of water
and a reasonable amount of exercise will also
do a lot towards overcoming the trouble. If
the scrub is cut too far from water, cattle
will hang round the fallen trees till they are
almost parched before they will make a long
trip for a drink. If the water is too close
they don’t get enough exercise to digest the
rough stuff. When feeding on belar I have
found a mile and a half the ideal
distance. I have an idea that impaction is
due less to the actual foliage than to tho
small twdgs which are chewed up with it.
A bullocky in the Boggabri district not only
kept a team of 14 bullocks in fair condition
on belar throughout a drought, but got
enough work out of them to keep his home
in tucker. He and his young son clipped the
stuff with shears, avoiding all twigs, and then
fed it to the bullocks in nosebags. But I
wouldn’t like to try to feed a mob of cattle
that way.
CROSS-BRANDING HORSES.
“N.M.L.”: For cross-branding aged and
broken-in horses it isn’t necessary to throw
them. Having caught the horse, bridled him,
and got your brands hot in the fire, blind
him on the side the cross-brand is to
go. A felt hat is a good blinker if it’s slipped
under the cheek-strap of the bridle. Before
putting on the hot brand rub with your
hand over the portion on which the brand
is to go. This clears dust off the spot and
also accustoms the horse to something
touching him on the blinded side. After
you’ve rubbed him a bit take a stick about
four feet long in the left hand and poke him
firmly but gently with that near the spot
where the brand is to go. This accustoms the
horse to something strange being placed on
him and tightens the skin so the brand may
make a good impression. Now, if the brand's
hot, put it on. A quick and light touch, a
hot iron, even pressure and you’ve got a
lasting impression formed before the horse
jumps from that biting iron. If it isn’t
too good an impression get some olive-oil or
castor-oil on the tip of your finger and trace
the indistinct portion of the brand with that.
That will blister on the tender skin when
the sun gets at it. and form a clear and per-
manent brand. If you've no oil, Stoekholm-
tar does as well.
FEEDING THE DOG.
“Jack Point”: Whether your dog is a
cattle or sheep worker or is merely kept for
the purpose of scaring itinerant peddlers, re-
member that his natural food is raw meat.
Give a tyke his first feed of raw meat at six
weeks old ; just a little chopped very finely.
Get him used to it by degrees, later on giv-
ing him big bones with just a little meat on
them. Proper feeding of raw meat never
harmed any dog yet; it is the practice of
giving it to him in junks that causes all the
trouble. A dog will swallow a big lump
straight down in one gulp and get indiges-
tion, which is the forerunner of a hundred
other diseases. The meat must either be
chopped finely or, preferably, fed on a bone
from which he can pick only small pieces at
a time. Of course it is not intended to dis-
parage cooked meat, which, with vegetables
(not spuds), barley, etc., makes an excellent
everyday ration, as well as being cheaper
than feeding the necessarily larger quantities
of raw stuff. But a certain amount of the
latter is indispensable to any dog if he is to
be at his best. For a bitch in whelp a liberal
ration of raw meat is essential. There is
only one explanation of the too-frequent
trouble of a bitch eating her pups; the
dearth of her natural tucker.
STRAWBERRIES FOR PROFIT.
“XSA”: Strawberry-growing is quite the
most profitable and least arduous land work
at the present time. I know a man on two
acres of land who collects £5OO per annum
regularly each season after only six months’
work—most of which is during late-winter
and spring, when other farm work is slack.
This man works on the succession plan.
Quarter-acre plots are laid out in beds
four feet wide with a narrow pathway be-
tween each. Plants are spaced one foot apart
in row's of four, from one end of the plot
to the other. This bed will bear fairly well
during the first year, but is at its best in
the second. After that the plants are used
for establishing the next bed from runners,
and go on. Three beds are thus constantly
in use, each a quarter of an acre in extent,
the rest of the ground lying fallow.
City water is the first essential, as sprink-
ler irrigation is quite necessary. The soil
should be good, but not necessarily rich. I
have found the berries to do well in both
sandy and clayey soils, but naturally the
clay entails more work, .
After ploughing and generally. laying out
the beds, most of the work becomes hand
work with hoe, rake or fork, but this is not
by any means heavy. It is most necessary
to have expert advice as to variety suitable
for the soil and situation of the plots and
as to the early and late kinds, which must
be planted in proportion to the ability to
handle the later sorts when the hot weather
arrives. These factors are important, especi-
ally as some berries are good croppers but
bad keepers.
The young plants seldom fail to take when
put into ground during late-autumn and are
well rooted before the cold weather arrives.
From thence onward little attention is re-
quired until August, when a dressing of
super, or other necessary fertiliser is
scratched into the mulch.
Some growers collect bags of pine-needlos,
with which they cover the plots to a depth
of about one inch. The new shoots from
the now growing plant emerge through this,
and fruit is thus kept off the ground. This
is quite necessary, and failing pine-needles
there are other materials equally efficacious.
Sprinklers are only used after sundown or
on very cloudy days, and then never when a
large picking is ready for market.
During last season prices near Sydney
realised by growers averaged clear Is. per
punnet, or 3s. per lb., whilst factories pay
to Is. 6d. per lb. for jam qualities.
It would be advisable for new growers who
are handy to Sydney to visit the large
strawberry beds at Marsfield, near Ryde, and
watch the cultural methods, and, incidentally,
notice the protecting wire-netting smothered
with sweet-peas—a very nice side-line.
FROST DAMAGE IN DRIED-FRUIT
AREAS.
“Croesus”: It is now possible to gauge
fairly accurately the extent of the damage
caused by the disastrous spring frosts, which
in two nights completely wrecked the pros
pects of the coming season’s crop of dried
fruits. The areas affected —along the Murray
Valley in North-Western Victoria and in
South Australia —were those which produce
practically the whole of Australia’s pack of
dried vine fruits, and the damage was so
widespread that anyone inspecting the
blackened areas within a day or two of the
frost might easily be pardoned for apprais-
ing the loss at S 5 per cent, of the whole
crop—the general estimate at first. Now
that a computation can be made on col-
lected data, however, it seems likely that
something approaching 50 per cent, of the
crop has been destroyed. The viticultural
experts of the States affected have studied
the damage with a view to recommending
the best treatment for the frost-bitten canes,
but they are of opinion that little can be
done.
Advice on this point has also been sought
by cable from California and, through Lon-
don, from French experts, without much
result. It seems to be agreed that a frosted
bud has lost its fruit irrevocably and no
reliable methods are known that will induce
any undamaged part of the vine to make up
the deficiency in yield. Nor are the known
methods of prevention much more effective
than those of cure. Smoke smudges are
advocated here and there, and undoubtedly
under favorable conditions these could pre-
vent or lessen damage from a frost.
But a frost may occur only once (or not
at all) in a season and may do all its damage
in half an hour; for the smudge remedy to
be effective growers would have to spen
dark hours- of every cold morning
watch ready to light the tires. And
the conditions most favorable to the loi -
tion of frost are no wind or clouds ana
heaviness of atmosphere, it is as line y
not that when the smudges were requ
the light air and absence of wind would
allow the smoke to rise vertically, and so
render it quite useless for protecting t
vines. e ,
Probably the grower’s surest safeguar
would be to insure against frost. Smce seri-
ous frosts have occurred in these district
only about three times in 30 years, the pre-
miums should not be heavy. In the mean-
time the only palliative measures possible
seem to be those advocated by the agricu -
tural inspectors sent up by the Govern-
ments to advise —the planting of catch crops
of lucerne, beans, Sudan grass and the like.
SCAB OR RUST OF CITRUS.
“Poncirus”: Along the coast of N.S.W.
and in humid districts, scab, or rust, does
boiijsiderable damage to citrus fruits at
times, particularly lemons. In severe cases
it renders lemons fit at best only for factory
use. It is a disease depending a.most
entirely on weather conditions at the bloom-
ing period or for a short period immediately
afterwards, and this is the time to use a
protective covering of spray as. a control.
Rain, dews or fogs at that period provide
ideal weather conditions for the germination
of the spores and the spread of the disease.
Bordeaux mixture is a satisfactory control
spray. It is not necessary to put it on
strong. Dilutions of from 150 to 80 gallons
of water to (51b. of copper sulphate and 41b.
ox lime will be found to control the disease
quite well. Usually one application when
the bulk of the petals have fallen from the
flowers will be sufficient. The Bordeaux is
then less harmful to the trees. It will go
through the pump easier if 1 per cent, red
oil is added to the mixture.
BORDEAUX MIXTURE AND
BORDEAUX OIL.
“Poncirus”: The formula is 61b. copper
sulphate (bluestone) ; 41b. builders’_lime, in
lumps ; water, any quantity from 25 to 100
gallons, according to the time of year and
disease to control. Use wooden vessels. Dis-
solve the bluestone in boiling water or,
when time does not press, suspend the blue-
stone in sacking in a vessel so that the
bottom of the sacking is just touching the
water. The bluestone solution should be
made up to at least 10 gallons by the addi-
tion of water. Slake the lime and make this
up to 10 gallons. Stir the lime solution and
let the heaviest particles settle; then use
only the milk of lime. Bring the lime solu-
tion and the bluestone solutions together.
This results in a mixture that does not
readily settle, and the copper, _ which is the
active agent in controlling fungi, is held in a
fine state of division and well distributed
throughout the mixture. Add water to make
up to whatever dilutions are required. Such
a mixture shows up well on the leaves
and fruit.
At times it is necessary to spray on to
ripening fruit, such as citrus. The super-
ficial markings which this is liable to
produce can be avoided by dissolving
the bluestone in as small a quantity
of water as possible, say a gallon of boiling
water. Slake the lime, adding a quantity of
water, stir well, allow to settle until the
clear lime-water appears. Add this clear
solution to the bluestone solution. Fill the
vessel containing the lime with water again,
allow to settle as previously and again add
the clear lime-water to the bluestone solu-
tion. Repeat this until the required amount
of mixture has nearly been reached. Test
the mixture for acidity with blue or red lit-
mus paper or white phenolphthalein paper.
When dipped in the mixture the changes in
color should be as follows if the mixture is
right. The blue should remain blue, the red
should turn blue and the white should turn
pink. If they do not act as described milk
of lime should be added little by little until
the desired reaction does take place. This
mixture is a little more trouble to make, but
not as much as the description of the pro-
cedure conveys. It is quite as effective as
other Bordeaux preparations and it will
leave only the slightest stain on the leaves
and fruit.
Bordeaux oil is simply Bordeaux mixture
with oil added. Any of the red spraying oils
on the Sydney market will mix with Bor-
deaux. With Gargoyle spraying oil make
the primary emulsion with a little soap pow-
der added to the water, and when that has
been done break it down to two or three
times its own bulk before adding to the
Bordeaux. Slowly pour into the Bordeaux,
stirrring well.
Oil in the mixture at the rate of 1 to 2
per cent, has many advantages over plain
Bordeaux on citrus-trees. It goes through
the pump easier and it acts as a spreader.
Bordeaux, if applied to citrus-trees, often lias
a hardening effect which the oil will tend

AN INVESTMENT
not an expense
NO SHEEPMAN can afford to ignore these Facts :
(1 ) The health - giving, vitality - increasing, and
value-raising effect of a good Sheep Lick is scienti-
fically and authoritatively proved by practical test. (2)
Ordinary Salt Licks are comparatively useless; home-made
compounded Licks are usually of little value and liable to
be dangerously harmful. (3) Large numbers of experienced
pastoralists and huge wool concerns have independently
testified to the proved-by-test fact that LIX-ALL is superior
to others—is, in fact, in a class by itself—and the most
VITALISING Sheep Tonic ever invented. (4) LIX-ALL
is a scientific, guaranteed-uniform blending of saline and
vegetable organic mixtures, plus substances containing pro-
teins, iron, and calcium phosphates, is RICH IN ANIMAL
VITAMINES, and increases food-assimilation by about
20 per cent. (5) LIX-ALL yields at least 2/- in in-
creased sheep-value for every 6d spent on it ! The increase
in wool-value alone would make LIX-ALL a fine invest-
ment. (6) LIX-ALL counteracts the chemical deficiencies
of, and enables sheep to thrive on, poor feed! It is palat-
able, nourishing, and satisfying to all stocks, prevents crav-
ing for bones, dead rabbits, burnt stick, etc., and promotes
functional stomach activity, ultimately rendering sheep im-
mune to internal and external paras.tes. (7) LIX-ALL
enriches and increases the milk of lambing ewes, stimulates
them to withstand bearing, and gives sturdiness to the lambs.
It results in an immense saving of ewes and lambs during
drought, and also reduces losses from the fly. (8) LIX-
ALL goes much further than other Licks —\\ ton of LIX-
ALL goes as far as 6 tons of ordinary salt. This has been
proved by practical tests with different flocks—each of 5000
ewes. LIX-ALL is therefore the most economical as well
as the most efficient and VITALISING Sheep Tonic ex-
tant. (9) LIX-ALL is packed in handy 701 b bags, 32 to
the ton, “ready to serve.” Why not invest in a trial ton now?

alarming extent after Bordeaux spraying
owing to the fact that the entomogenous
fungi that live on the scale insects are killed
out. The oil in the mixture helps to keep
the scale insects in check until such times

foul-brood.
“Te Hipi”: “Larrapinta” is astray on a
few points in his remarks about foul-brood
(B. 22/9/’27). Robbing bees are rarely the
offenders in carrying foul-brood. No contact
with infected bees or hives is needed to
spread the disease. The working bees in
visiting the flow T ers in search of honey leave
germs on every bloom they touch. Other
bees, from hives miles away perhaps, pick up
the germs from these flowers and carry them
back to their hives.
As “Larrapinta” says, very badly infected
hives should be burnt, bees and all. But
it is a poor apiarist 'who lets the thing go
that far. The hives should be examined not
less than once a week. When foul-brood
shows itself, remove all good honey and
sterilise it. Transfer the bees to a box (not
a hive) and burn the old hive and the comb.
Keep the bees in the box for two days, allow-
ing none to escape. Then transfer to a
new hive and burn the box. You are pretty
certain to have finished the foul-brood then.
“Larrapinta’s” method is too slipshod. By
the way, sterilising the honey from an in-
fected hive is most important. If you sell
it without having done so some apiarist may
buy it to feed his bees in winter, having
not saved enough of his own honey for the
purpose. The result will probably be an
outbreak of foul-brood in some, if not all,
his hives.
OTJR “COARSE” WOOL.
“Trepex”: “Staple” (B. 3/11/’27) talks
of “coarse-wool protagonists.” Who are
they? I believe I have been the most con-
sistent supporter of the Australian merino
in the Bulletin, and I have contributed to
Bradford trade journals on the same sub-
ject. But I am no advocate of growing
actual coarse merino wool, and I doubt if
any such people exist. As a commercial
proposition, the big, bold, robust wool of
medium or medium to strong quality is to
be desired and recommended. In the ‘breed-
ing and maintenance of tire strain it is un-
fortunately necessary that a small propor-
tion of really coarse stuff should come up
through the general average. This is to be
regretted and, if possible, eliminated, but not
at the cost of spoiling the main product.
Straightness of fibre, a rath»r too common
fault, is also to be deplored. But neither
straightness nor coarseness is sufficiently
general to bring upon us a wholesale con-
demnation.
“Staple” complains that the defence of
Australian wool is always the same—-we can
grow fine wool if we want to, but we find
it pays us better to grow the stronger stuff.
Could he want any better defence? We
grow wool for profit, not for exhibition,
nor for a conservative and money-losing love
of tradition.
“Staple” counts himself out when he says
that we “barrackers for the coarse-wool
obsession” are mostly brokers or other
middlemen who are more concerned with the
volume than the quality of the goods we
sell. The broker draws his commission on
the aggregate value of the wool he sells. If
he could secure the same or a higher aggre-
gate by handling the bigger priced produce
in smaller volume with consequent lower
costs, is he fool enough to go the other way
about it? “Staple” should realise that it
costs as much to handle a bale of lOd. wool
as a bale of the 30d. goods. In this matter,
growers’ and brokers’ interests are identical.
AFRICAN v. AUSTRALIAN WOOL.
“FY7” : in airily remarking that the
warning of a “university professor” about the
change for the worse in the quality of Aus-
tralian wools, which was quoted by me,
■ isn t worth getting excited over,” “Trepex”
(B. 10/11/’27) dodges the fact that the prof,
in question holds the Chair of Textiles at
the University of Leeds, which is one of
the world’s authorities on wool. Not being
a wool-manufacturer or a broker, this pro-
cessor _ has, apparently, no axe to grind, but
has given his dispassionate opinion. The
South African wool samples brought back
li m l ' rGpe^,s ” fri3nrJ may be “laughable,”
as ‘lrepex” says they are. The fact remains,
however, that other South African samples
have so tickled English buyers that they have
paid higher prices for them than for our own
fine wools, which would indicate that if
there is a joke it is on us.
THE DANGEROUS ALSATIAN.
Ponto ’: The feeling that the Alsatian
dog is likely to become a dangerous menace
to Australian flocks continues to grow, and
though the Federal Government has not yet
acceded to the request of the recent
Graziers F'ederal Council that the importa-
tion of the Alsatian be forbidden, a move
is being made against the wolf-like tyke in
other quarters. The Westralian Royal Agri-
cultural Society has set the ball rolling by
cutting out the classes for Alsatians from
its future shows. The N.S.W. body has
agreed to follow Westralia’s example. It is
hoped that shortly all the societies in the
other States will come into line, and this
should materially affect the present craze for
the breed, wdiich is a show-bench one and
or no general use to the community. English
advices state that the Alsatian is a con-
filmed and savage sheep-killer, and is already
under the ban of the sheep-grazing farmers
of the southern counties. The introduction
of such a strain to our ow T n wild-dog com-
munity is not a prospect to be faced with
equanimity.
SOFT-SHELLED EGGS.
Hatter : It is not only the old hen that
lays soft-shelled eggs (B. 13/10/’27). Any hen
that is overfat and clumsy is liable to do so,
but this condition is frequently associated
with old age. Shell-less or paper-shelled eggs
may b e attributed to one of three causes:
Lack of oyster-shell or other suitable
material; a fright or a slight accident such
as a fall from the perch, which causes the
egg to slip before it is quite ready and before
tiie shell is completed in the glands (such
eggs are usually not quite full) ; and, thirdly,
too much confinement and too little sunshine.
In this last case the egg will be full when
laid, but the shell will be papery, or ridgy or
otherwise imperfect. It has been found that
when a flock producing eggs of this type
is turned out into the sunshine the quality
of the shell at once improves.
WHITE LEGHORNS AS LAYERS.
“ Jack Point”: There’s money in chooks
all right, and the White Leghorn is still
far from being a back number. Last season
a pen of 10 birds of this breed, specially
selected by the Canadian Breeders’ Associa-
tion, made the wonderful average of 296
eggs per bird for a year’s laying. The top
score for one bird was 351 eggs, which was
the world’s record until an Australian Black
Orpington, at Toowoomba, raised it to 351.
It easily stands out as the record for a
White Leghorn, however. Manv offers were
made to purchase the pen, the highest bid
being $5OOO, but the reply to all was “Noth-
ing doing.”
BIRDS AS SEED-SPREADERS.
“Curlew”: If birds do not destroy seeds
that they eat, will anyone tell me how they
live? If they do not digest the seeds they
might as well eat gravel. Certainly there
are many hard-shelled seeds that will not
digest unless the shell is broken —wattle-seeds,
tagosaste, mistletoe and others. But you
have only to watch a rosella or other parrot
eating seeds having a hard outer covering
to see that mostly every seed is shelled and
the indigestible fibre discarded. What holds
true of poultry holds good of birds, and
anyone feeding grains or small seeds to poul-
try knows perfectly well that they are
digested unless they have an impermeable
covering. By all means protect the birds—
except only the crow. If some little harm
is done by distributing seeds of useless hard-
seeded plants it is offset a hundredfold by
the good the birds do.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Silentio”: To make a simple and effective
wire-strainer get a piece of piping 2ft. 6in.
or 3ft. in length and about 2£in or 3in. in
diameter, heat in the fire, and about 10 inches
from the end bend it at right angles. About
two or three inches from this end pierce a
hole large enough to take the usual gauges
of wire. Any amount of strain can be put
on, and long strains handled by one man.
“Seaplant”: “Jim Domino” is right in
saying (B. 27/10/’27) that dipping does
not destroy ticks in dogs. I have found
a specific in ordinary blue ointment (Ureg.
hydrarg, 8.P.). It should be rubbed well in
at a spot the dog cannot lick, such as behind
the ear. A piece the size of a marble applied
every second week will keep a cattle-dog free
of the pest. The mercury is absorbed by the
skin, and forms compounds in the blood
which are distasterul to ticks, fleas or other
blood-drawing parasites. It works equally
well on pigs and horses.
“Werri” : The maize cob does not require
to be dipped in kerosene for kindling pur-
poses (“Sucre,” B. 27/10/’27). When
thoroughly dry it is a first-rate kindler with-
out any aid. A handful or two are often
used by farmhands when they want to boil
a billy in a hurry. The cob has many uses
on the farm, from file-handles to pipes. It
is a useful stopper for mouse-holes in bags
of grain, and a convenient currycomb for rub-
bing sweat-stains off Dobbin.
“Furphy”: It looks as if this were going
to be a bad summer as far as the blowfly
pest is concerned, and it will pay anyone who
has unshorn lambs to crutch them without
delay. The crutcliing of the ewe lamb particu-
larly should be thorough. Cut as closely as
possible all the wool between the legs from
the foot to the crutch, then clean the outside
of the legs, continuing down the thighs and
right over the tail. Don’t be afraid of over-
doing the job. Three inches up the back
from the butt of the tail should be the mini-
mum, and keep the margin of the uncut wool
as uniform as possible. Nothing looks moi-e
ugly than careless crutcliing. Some sheep-
men prefer to shear off the belly, neck and
head wool as well, but in a season such as
this grass-seed is not likely to be trouble-
some, so plain wigging should suffice.
“Villers-Brett.”: When dehorning calves
with caustic smear the skin immediately sur-
rounding the button or embryo horn with vase-
line to protect it from burning. The caustic
should not b.e handled, but used in a container
such as an ordinary pencil-holder. After
four applications the buttons will usually
peel off. The dehorning of adult cattle is a
painful operation and should not be resorted
to unless absolutely necessary. If the ends
of the horns are sawn off and not filed round,
cattle that horn others in the yard will be
prevented from doing much damage.
“Furphy”: To take out old fenceposts,
get a piece of sound hardwood 3ft. x 4in. x
2in. and cut a V-notch in one end. Other
requirements are a horse, trace-chains and a
drag-chain. To lift a post hook the drag-
chain round the bottom, lean the 4in. x 2in.
at an angle of about 45 degrees against the
post and run the chain over the notch. Let
the horse pull, and as the 4in. x 2in. come 3
to the perpendicular the post will lift.
“Silentio”: In a district where water is
scarce and droughts are prevalent try grow-
ing a few lines of vegetables in tins. Petrol-
or kerosene-tins with the tops cut off, or
sideways for smaller lines, some decent soil,
a little manure, and just the waste water
from the house will work wonders. For the
present any of the spring lines of vegetables
can be tried. Marrows, squash of many
varieties (of the bush variety for prefer-
ence), lettuce, cucumbers, radishes, tomatoes
and even potatoes can be successfullv
handled in this way. The tomato takes most
kindly to this treatment, two plants being
grown in one tin, with a stick sft. or 6ft. long
placed in the centre, to which the plants are
tied. As the plant grows, useless leaves and
side growths should be removed. A couple of
plants, put in a sheltered spot in winter time
will yield a good supply of cuttings for the
following spring; they will easily root under
glass. Running plants like cucumbers will
fall down the sides of the tin and carry on
quite unconcerned. A few yards of sacking
will save the kero.-tin garden from- hot
winds.

LIKE THE WIND.
Love is like the wind that blows:
Whence its coming no man knows;
Soft as scented breeze of spring,
When glad birds of mating sing,
Love unheralded creeps in,
Straight the inmost shrine to win;
Or it comes the soul to rock
With the cyclone's crashing shock;
Swift each rampart down- it throws.
Love is like the wind that blows.
Love is like the wind that blow’s:
Who can tell the way it goes?
Dying into perfect peace,
As at twilight zephyrs cease,
Love may pass unseen, unknown,
None to mark its vacant throne ;
Or, the clash of tempest rage,
Write love’s “Finis” on the page,
Bitter with remembered woes.
Love is like the wind that blows.
Love is like the wind that blows:
Fetterless it comes and goes ;
Setting fragrant blooms a-dance,
Breathing subtle sweet romance,
Sweeping wrack and clouds away,
Ravening to rend and slay,
Wasting with a fiery breath,
Fierce as desert wind of death;
Who its secrets can disclose?
Love is like the wind that blows.

D. GLASSON.
IN DAYS OF SHIVERRY.
A piercing Sliriek fell on the barmy air.
The Knight halted his rusty steed and lis-
sened. Again that Shriek, as if some
Defenseless Woman was asking for Help.
It seemed to float down from a window m
the frowning Tower of the Grim Castle.
THE UNFAIR SEX AGAIN.
LOTHARIO : “I was nearly married once
to a widow; but she disappointed me.”
SLEEPER: “Did she jilt yer?”
LOTHARIO : “Practically. She had a good job
in the laundry and she gave it up.”
Without a moment's hesitation Sir Walter
Wiltnot put spurs in his steed and dashed
to the iron gate. In answer to his Summons
a scoundei'ly face piered through a gate.
“Open, dog, and let me rescue yon damo-
sel,” quoth Our Hero, sharply.
“The Baron allows none to interfear with
his private concerns, rash Knight,” said
the Knave. “Be warned and keep out of this
Buisness.”
With a croking Laugh he banged the gate
shut. The anger Flamed in Our Hero’s
face; but he knew that it was Hopless to
force an entrance. He would have to use
stradgsdy. , ,
At the Castle next door he learnt that
Baron De La Ripper was the Terror of the
Countryside. Nerely every week could be
heard Terrible screams as he executed his
latest wife. His brutality frightened the
poor into Submission and he robbed them
Right and Left.
An Hour later a bare-footed Fryer might
have been seen knocking at the gate of the
Baron’s castle. From above the voice was
still screaming.
Seeing who it was, the Grim keeper
opened the gate. “The Baron, niy master,
will be glad to see you, i’ Faith,” he said.
As he turned to lead the way the Grim
Servitor did not notice that the Fryer slip-
ped the key out of the Gate and put it
under his Cassock.
“My master is going to force the Fair
Lady Ermytrude to marry him,” grinned the
wicked knave, evilly. “She is in his Power,
and well she may scream. In a week the
Baron will be tired of her and she will Die ;
and he will seize her Vast Estates. If you
do not consent to marry them, you will be
put on the Rack.”
The Fryer bent his head and seemed to
mutter a frightened prayer, and the ruffian
laughed. He threw open a door and said,
“Master, here is a Holey man to do your
bidding.”
The seen which presented itself would
make the blood boil. The fair Ermytrude
was standing on the parapet, with only a
thin ledge between her and Eternity, and
before her, with an expression of Sinister
Crulety on his face, stood the wicked
Baron.
“Advance another step, and I will hurl
myself to the Rocks below! Better death
than marriage with such as thou !” she cried.
The Baron obviously w T as in a dillema;
he seemed relieved to see the Fryer.
“ ’S Blood,” he cried, “you cannot escape
me! This holey man will proclaim us mar-
ried and then, whatever you do, your Estates
will be mine. How now. what say you, Sir
Fryer? A good fee for doing what you are
(oled, or the Torcher chamber?”
The answer supprised him. The Fryer
threw back his cassock, and our Dauntless
Hero, Sir Walter Wiltnot, stood revealed. In
a moment his sword was out, and the \ il-
lanus gatekeeper fell, Peersed through the
Heart.
“Aha! Treachery!” roared the Baron,
rushing out of the Chamber to get his sword
and calling to his vassals to assemble, lhe
fair Ermytrude rushed to Our Hero’s arms.
“There is not a moment to be Lost!” he
cried. “Come!”
Swiftly they ran out towards the battle-
ments. Led by the Baron, his villanous crew
were rushing up the stairs, but, seizing the
burning brazier, Our Hero fearlessly threw
it down amongst them. It delayed them but
a moment. Hardly had the fugitives reached
the battlements before the pursures poured
after them, full of swords. Ilastelly whisper-
ing instructions to the Courageous Lady, Sir
Walter turned to meet their rush.
Besides the Baron there were eight sturdy
villans, and they surrounded Our Hero ; but
he was Undaunted. Swinging his Sword in
a circle, he skilfully caught all their Nine
(9) blades upon itj and, with an agile twist
of the wrist, sent their weapons spinning in
the air. None but a skilled swordsman could
have done this trick. They scattered to re-
cover their blades ; but, before they could rush
again Our Hero’s sword had Tasted the
Life Blood of three of them.
But, for all his skill, it would have gone
hard with Our Hero had not the Baron
slipped on the Gore of one of the bodies. In
a moment he fell, peersed by Our Hero’s
point, apparently dead; and, Disliartened,
the other villans fled.
Sir Walter spent no time in pursuet. The
lady, obeying his Instruction, had caught the
rope thrown from the Castle next door and
tyed it Round one of the battlements. Seizing
her in his arms, our Galant Hero proceeded
to make his way, hand over hand, along the
rope to safety. T ,
But, Stay! The Baron is not dead. No!
Although bleeding, he staggers to his feet,
and musters his men again. Hardly had Our
1-lero and his fare load gone half-way before
his Crule face appeared over the battlement
ordering his men to release the rope and
Dash the Fugitives to their Doom !
Three burly ruffians have already Undone
the rope, and are ready to let it go. Only
their weight is keeping it up. It seems that
nothing can save them Now.
But Our Hero has not been idol. Passing
the fair lady to the arm holding the rope
he drew his sword from its scabbard with his
free hand, and, with one Last, Desperate
Hope, hurled the weapon.
It was unfortunate for the villans that
their heads were close together. The skil-
fully-hurled sword severed their nex at one
fell swoop, and their lifeless bodies toppaled
over the battlements.
Had they released the rope, Our Hero and
the fare Ermytrude would have been Hurled
to Destruction. Instead their death-grips
remained Firm, and when they fell to the
ground their bodies made a weight which
kept the Rope Tort.
Instead of being Killed, Our Hero was able
to slide down the rope, taking his fare bur-

THE BENEDICT: “Oh, yes. Quite satisfied.
I don’t want any more of it.”
den to safety. And even as, Docked in
each other’s Arms, they looked up, they saw
the Castle Burst into Flames.
The brazier hurled by Sir Walter had
done its deadly work. Remembering the key
he had taken, Our Hero realised that th 1
villans who had survived were Docked in,
and the vile nest of oppressors would be
Burnt to Death.

There is no need to lose charm
and daintiness, however stren-
uous your activities. Women
who are renowned for their
beauty lead arduous lives
and the secret lies on many
dressing tables or in bath rooms.
It is the daily use of
Eau cle Cologne.
First thing in the morning, they pour
a little into the bath this gives the
water that tonal quality which refresh-
es and invigorates the skin, keeping
it wholesome and clean. At other
times they never think of washing
without a few drops of “471V ’ being
poured in the toilet basin. This not
only refreshes the skin but keeps the
complexion wonderfully radiant and
with a healthy glow.
The choice of Eau de is very
important. Always ask for “4711”
with the Blue and Gold Label renown-
ed for nearly 150 years for absolute
purity, guaranteed streng h and un-
rivalled and lasting fragrance.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STRETCH poured all that remained of
the beer into the glass and gulped it
down. Then he threw himself back on
the creaking bed, snarling.
The girl, who stood at the dressing-table,
took no notice; she was engrossed in her
making up. It was her business to transform
herself from a pallid, weary woman into a
young and saucy beauty, and she did it, too.
Only a year ago she had required little
or none of either paint or powder. Now
she needed a heavy camouflage before she
could stand the bright lights, and even then
there were shadows under her great, dark
eyes; and her mouth was hardened by lines
at the corners.
Adjusting her hat to the correct angle,
she looked upon her reflection with smiling
iips. Near enough she thought for such a
night as this, and the people she was likely
to meet. She gathered up her handbag and
moved towards the door, her heels tapping
lightly on the bare floor, and her short skirt
swishing softly.
Stretch turned towards her on his pillow
and surveyed her with his little bloodshot
eyes.
“Fetch home a wad,” he growled. “There
isn’t a cent in the house, and not a
drop. I might go out meself, and I mightn’t.
I'm too ill, anyhow, to do any good. God,
I wish I had a drink!”
The girl stepped out into the street. The
early dark of the winter night was closing
in. Already the lights played in the city.
She walked towards the park, with swinging
hips and lilting step; it was part of her
business to appear energetic. A man was
coming towards her who looked as though
he might be interested. She peered up at
him with tragic eyes and smiling mouth.
“Come for a walk, honey?” she asked
The man stopped in front of her, and from
his height of over six feet stared down. He
was lean and sun-browned —that was all she
noticed about him. As for him, he was aware
of her eyes only—-eyes that loomed up in her
shadowy face, and gave the lie to the
laughter of her lips. His own eyes were
grey, and rather whimsical, but wonder-
fully clear.
“Why, Miss Lovely,” he said, “we can do
something better than that. Come with me,
and to-night I’ll make you a princess.”
“Cut out the fairy-tale stuff, Duke,” she
laughed. “I mean business.”
“Come and see,” he replied, and offered her
his arm.
It was late-closing night for the shops.
He called a taxi, handed her into it, and
bade the driver take them to a well-known
drapery store. The place glowed with light
and color.
“I want you,” he said, “to dress this lady
as a duchess might be dressed to-night. I
have no idea of the cost, but here’s £2OO.
If you need more, come to me. Now, please,
get busy.”
The astonished saleswoman led the bewil-
dered girl away. The man threw himself
into an easy chair, and gazed round the place
at the customers and shop-people with great
interest. He was interested for the simple
reason that it was twenty years since he had
witnessed such a scene. It was his first day
in town after that long period away in the
Far North. Elis beat had been miles from
civilisation—out beyond even where the cattle
lun. The only women he had seen were
lubras. And to-day he was back in
Sydney knowing no one, and his loneliness
was _ greater than any he had ever
experienced away among the sand and
spinifex of the plains. And he was rich —
richer than he had ever expected to be.
.He was a dreamer. He had promised
himself that if ever he “struck lucky,” and
had the money, he would pick up a girl, hope-
less _ and helpless, with the tragedy of her
life in her eyes, and raise her to the gates of
Heaven. In the girl he had met this night
he thought he had found such a one. She
had come into his life just as he had wished ;
and her eyes were tragic stars.
Now she was coming towards him. The
saleswoman had done her work well; the
girl was marvellously transformed —dress,
shoes, stockings, everything seemed perfect.
Her face was radiant with joy and excite-
ment. Clinging to his arm, she stepped out
into the street.
The place they dined at was the best the
girl knew of. For twenty years the man had
not eaten food like it. He was perfectly
happy, and it was not his fault if she was
not happy, too. All the time he kept finding
wonderful and beautiful things about her,
and telling her of them in the delightful
and whimsical way he had. She had never
thought that such a man existed. He was
beyond her understanding.
He told her a lot about himself, and asked
her to call him Terry. Concerning her he
asked little or nothing. The brutal Stretch
was forgotten—him and the twelve months of
terror and suffering through which she had
lived with him. Whether he held her by
something akin to love, by fear, or even by
hate she could not have told you any more
than all the girls and women who live
with such men under similar circumstances
could tell you.
From the restaurant they went to a
theatre, sitting so near the stage that she felt
as if she was taking part in the show. He
planned for them a wonderful future—
roses, soft lights, music and tropic moon-
shine on the waters of many harbors that
he knew.
The show came to an end. Clinging to his
arm she stepped in to the street again—the
street that should have become a fairyland,
and she a princess.
In the crowd a man who had come up
behind them pressed close against her com-
panion, jostling him.
“Ahj” Terry exclaimed, grabbing him by
the coat collar and swinging him round.
“Le’ me go, blast you,” the man cried.
The lean brown hand shifted from the
crook’s coat collar to his windpipe, and
closed like a steel trap. Tli e man gave a
gasp, and hung limp.
“Don’t struggle, my friend,” said Terry
quietly. “You picked my pocket. I’m going
to hand you over to the police as soon as
they come !”
A crowd gathered. A plainclothes man
elbowed his way through. A uniformed con-
stable appeared. “What’s this?” they asked.
“Pickpocket,” replied Terry. “Take him.
I’ll go round to the charge office if you want
me?”
“Did he get down on you?” the plain-
clothes man inquired.
He got a roll of notes from me,” Terry
declared. “I felt his hand in ray pocket.”
And then the girl’s eyes met the eyes of
Stretch. Unconsciously, almost, she moved
to his side. He was her man still.
Stretch recognised her with'a little gasp.
In a flash he made up his mind what to do,
and in some way she tuned in to his stronger
will, understood without a word spoken or
MR. N. PECK KNOWS HIS PLACE.
“What are you doing, James?”
“Making my wish, my dear.”
“What? Making your wish?”
“Yes, my love. In your presence, my dear, I wouldn’t presume to call it my will.”
a signal given. She swung towards him and
in a second she had the notes concealed
under her coat, while still she clung to
Terry’s arm.
Five minutes later they were all together
at the police-station. A search of Stretch
revealed that he had no roll of notes on him.
The police were knocked back. The most
important part of the evidence was missing.
The sergeant at the desk looked doubtful.
“Sure you made no mistake?” he asked.
“Positive,” replied Terry. “His hand was
in my pocket when I caught him.”
“No, it wasn’t,” declared the crook. “I
never touched your pocket. You bumped
into me, that’s all. What did you grab me
by the throat for? Shot, I suppose.”
The sergeant frowned. He knew Stretch,
but without the notes it might be useless
to go on with the case. He decided to
send the crook down to the cells for the
night, at any rate. They might pick up
someone who would throw some light on the
matter later.
Again Terry and the girl were out in the
street. She leaned against him.
“Better let me take you home now,” he
said, and signalled to a passing taxi. “To-
morrow I shall go down to the police-court
and get that waster the sentence he de-
serves. He’s a thief, all right.”
It was a call to her to come to her man's
rescue.
“No, he isn’t,” she shrilled in the voice
of a woman at bay. “And he never took
the money from you. If you want to know,
I took it.” And she held up the notes.
Hard-eyed and tight-lipped she met the
astonished gaze of Terry. “Now send for a
cop and have me arrested —and be damned
to you.”
But Terry stood with a queer dull look
in his eyes. Shadows came creeping on his
face. He looked old.
Hands on hips, the girl stared back at
him —defiant. With a little smile Terry
shook his head. “Get into the cab and go
home,” he said.
Without another word he turned on his
heel and strode away.
JOHN MALCOLM.
The Christmas Gift.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SKIMPY” RYAN, as his surname sug-
gests, was of Irish descent, and the
nickname had been added only this
year. Previously he had dissipated his earn-
ings as fast as they accumulated. Now,
through some imperious change, 11.0 hung on
to them desperately. And hanging on wasn’t
easy in that Mecca of bohemianism —-a rail-
way-construction camp.
“Matt Ryan, M.S.M.S (Member of the
Society of Muck-shifters),” as the wag of the
camp dubbed him, had been an accountant,
but success had gone to his head; drink
had cast him, as it had cast so many others,
on the labor market, and the environment
had had the usual effect of blunting his
susceptibilities. He had gone so far as
to make love to the wife of a fellow-
worker —an uncultured, ignorant woman,
whose life had been spent in rough camp-
conditions, and whom he now realised he
should have protected from, rather than have
awakened to, the suggestion of freer and
more easeful conditions in the cities.
Matt had been finding his new state of
mind a difficult proposition to handle. In
the old days no thought of to-morrow was
permitted to intrude. He took the gifts the
gods offered, and the only limit was his phy-
sical ability to deal the cards or to raise the
glass. Then had happened the fatality when
his mate had been killed at his side by a
fall of earth. His last words had been of
advice to his friend : “The game’s not worth
the candle, Matt. You’re too good for this.
Go back to the ‘old woman’ and make your
place again. Leave this to the rats who’ve
sold their birthright to till their bellies.”
Matt had been stirred by his words and
some of the old pride-of-place had come
back. He thought of his wife and children,
and wondered if they had yet forgiven him.
He believed that time would ease the hurt
he had caused his wife and that she would
gradually .evolve excuses for him. She had
been a dainty little thing, pampered by rich
parents before her marriage, and, upon his
indictment for irregularities regarding trust
funds, her father had hastily removed his
darling to her old home, and with her the
two children. Three years ago ! Nancy would
be six—commencing school! And his
son (how strange it sounded), would be
toddling about on his sturdy little legs!
Matt wondered if they ever spoke of him.
Or was he erased from their memories as
though he had never been?
The thought irritated him. He was still
a young man and could make his way again
as successfully as ever! And he would. He
decided to study his profession again, while
taking a course of exercise to recover his
physical fitness. He would challenge Fate,
and fight his way back to the top. So he
decided to write to his wife, stating his
determination to recover liis old position;
and he must speak to that woman, too, and
try to amend the harm he had done in
breeding dissatisfaction with her present con-
dition.
For nearly a year Matt had lived his new
life and was looking almost his old self.
His wife had replied coldly that she had no
confidence in his alleged repentance, but if
he were able to rise again she would be
glad to hear of his success. With the
optimism of the race Matt had relied upon
his powers of persuasion in stating his case,
and had been thinking pleasantly of his
return to the more congenial environment of
his former life. The memory of the charm
that had first appealed to him in his wife
was becoming very dear. He was falling in
love again. Since his regeneration he had
been accepted into the homo of the time-
keeper, and this had re-awakened the desire
for those pleasant intimacies which only
one’s own home-life can offer and which so
sweeten life as to make them of all things
the most desirable.
The Christmas closing-down of the camp
set Matt homeward-bound in a happy state
of mind. He had saved enough money to
set him up in a small way and he had the
utmost confidence in his ability to win
through. He had arrived at Townsville,
whence he would travel home by steamer,
and it was here that he met a link from the
past—a former acquaintance and business
rival who had not regretted Matt’s removal
from his commercial path. In response to
inquiries he stated, maliciously, that Matt’s
wife appeared to be amusing herself tolerably
well —with Dick Nevill. “They go every-
where together. She looks young and happy
again,” he said.
Matt’s hopes were shattered. He had been
a fool to imagine that the world wmuld stand
still for his sake. Dick Nevill had been his
rival for the liaiid of his wife. Naturally,
he would take the opportunity of renewing
his friendship when the husband, who had
failed so lamentably, had begun, a career
which would probably terminate in a hotel
brawl.
Matt’s house of cards fell about his head,
and the Christmas season, which had
promised so wonderfully, had now lost all
savor.
Matt had wandered to that part of the
Northern City which is known as China-
town, and he was approached by a half-
drunken navvy who whispered loudly that
“Burns was lookin’ fer ’im with a gun down
at the Cutters’ Arms. He’s probably mad,”
he added.
Matt thanked him and walked on.
So the husband of “that woman” had heard
something. Quite likely had been told by the
woman herself. Well, his wife would
probably regard his death as a welcome
Christmas gift, he thought bitterly, and “that
woman” would adhere to her own husband
in future.
Be paused as he l'eached the dirty-looking
Cutters’ Arms, and listened to the raucous
voices. Once he had joined in this kind
of thing. He thought of his dainty little
wife; of Dick Nevill—kindly, clean-living,
respected by all. Was it any wonder she had
turned to Dick after her experience with
him?
Well, it was not too late to consider hjs
wife’s happiness.
Matt raised his hat. “A Merry Christ-
mas,” he said, with a twisted smile, and
he pushed open the swing-doors of the bar
to meet whatever was waiting there for him.

Information Sought.
How can I rid an orchard of sorrel and
conch grass? —lB92.
By shallow summer cultivation. The area
should be ploughed not more than three
inches deep before the plants seed. Keep
the surface soil well stirred with spring-tooth
cultivators and barrows during the summer
months, collecting and burning the plants
as they become dry.
How to cure a broken-winded horse? —
2253.
In slight cases of recent origin diet should
be light and concentrated, no long hay being
allowed. Feed in small quantities and at
frequent intervals. Never wiork the horse on
a full stomach. Water should always be
given before feeding. A dose of physic should
be given followed by the following powder
once a day in the feed for a month ; white
arsenic, 5 grains; powdered nux vomica,
1 dram; bi-carbonate of soda, loz. If the
case is chronic and of long standing ameliora-
tion of the graver symptoms by attention to
diet is all that can be expected.
Does the Q'ld Fair Rents Act contain
provisions dealing with landlord'■ and tenant
on farming lands? —2000.
The Act applies to dwelling-houses only,
and expressly excludes the premises of any
farm, grazing area, orchard, market-garden
or dairy-farm.
Cure for blight on tomatoes. —2103.
Spotted wilt of tomato is best controlled
by removal of the diseased plants as soon
as they are observed and by spraying to
keep down the insect-carriers. Tobacco-
wash is a useful spray. “Black Leaf 40” is
suitable. Leaflets posted.
Are stud sheep still being shipped to South
Africa? With whom should 1 get in touch
for employment in connection with ship-
ments? —1958.
Yes. Australian Mercantile Land and
Finance Co., 4 Bligh-street, Sydney, would
be, perhaps, the best firm to apply to for a
position.
Simple process for tanning rabbit-skins?
2127.
Soak the skins in cold water for a few
hours, then carefully scrape the backs and
remove any fat. Mix together 2oz. pow-
dered alum, loz. common salt in each gallon
of water and soak skins for eight hours. Then
rub an odorless vegetable oil into the skins
and roll in a cloth for about an hour. Pre-
pare anoth-er liquor, minus the salt, with 3oz.
alum to the gallon, and soak for another
eight hours. Stretch and tack on a table
until dry. The drying must be done away
from the sunlight. If the skins dry harsh,
oil very sparingly and soak again for a few
minutes.
How to combat snails and woodlice, also
a fly which attacks flowers of beans and
peas? —2ll9.
The N.S.W. Government Entomologist
states that snails and woodlice can be con-
trolled by means of poison baits, lime and
tobacco-dust, arsenate of lead, etc. He has
no record of any fly attacking flowers of
beans and peas. Without seeing specimens it
is impossible to state what may be causing
the damage.
How can I soften Murray River water?
-1974.
The Public Works Department states that
the water of the Murray and Murrumbidgee
is soft and requires no treatment. Before
any advice can be given on a specific case
it is necessary to know the chemical compo-
sition of the water and the purpose for which
it is to be used.
My wife and I are N.S.W. station-workers.
What wages and hours apply in our case ?
We have a boy six years old. Does his board
count? After a full 12 months' work are
we entitled to holidays? —226B.
N.S.W. Pastoral Employees Act provides
that a married couple doing station work
shall receive pay not less than at the rate of
£2OO per year and keep. Annual holidays
are not provided for. ' Plours for the man
must not exceed 52 per week without pay-
ment of overtime. The child's keep would
be a matter to be adjusted between employer
and employee.
Best preparation .for branding sheep and
cattle before turning them into scrub coun-
try for about six months? —2l43.
Cattle are most satisfactorily branded by
means of a firebrand and sheep by means
of the slieep-branding preparations which
are on the market.
In the Kiarna district {N.S.W.) are to be
seen numerous fences of piled-up stones. Are
they a relic of convict days? —2oBs.
Fences of this nature are common in all
parts of Australia. Settlers whose areas
were littered with stones utilised them for
enclosing their paddocks.
(1) Is there any icay by which a student
can become a. solicitor in N.S.W. except
being articled? (2) Is it necessary to have
passed the matriculation exam, to attend
Law School lectures? (3) What are the
matric. subjects for the Law standard, and
could I be coached? —2o2o.
(1) The Rules of the N.S.W. Supreme
Court relating to the admission of solicitors
require, in such a case as you refer to, five
years’ articled clerkship or, in the case of a
graduate of the University, three years. (2)
Before being articled it is necessary to mat-
riculate either at the Feb. matriculation
examination or pass at the Leaving Certifi-
cate examination in the subjects required
for Law matriculation. The student can
attend the Law School lectures during the
period of his articles. (3) The following
are compulsory subjects: (a) English, (b)
mathematics, (c) Latin, (d) one of the fol-
lowing—Greek, French, German or Japanese.
In addition the candidate may elect to take
history or mechanics or a prescribed science
subject. Some of the younger men at the
Bar coach students preparing for either
branch of the law.
Were the short service rifles used at the
tear Mk 111 or Mk VII f— 2ool.
The rifles used during the Great War by
the A.I.F. were short Mk 111 sighted for
Mk VII ammunition.
Good method of poisoning flies? —2115.
Health Department pamphlets on “Pre-
vention and Destruction of Flies” has been
posted. You might also try this: One
tablespoonful of 40 p.c. formalin in one pint
of water. A little sugar and milk may be
added with advantage. Place the mixture
in plates, and put a piece of bread or blot-
ting-paper in centre for the flies to alight
upon.
I would like to know of any market for
sawn ironbark sleepers. Is there a market
in Sydney for sawn hoop and bunya pine?
—2211.
There should be a ready market for sawn
ironbark sleepers in your own State : it would
not pay to send them to either Sydney or
Melbourne. Most timber-merchants in Sydney
will readily purchase hoop and bunya pine if
prices are right.
Is a record published containing the num-
bers of Ford engines? —2los.
Ford motor people state that no record of
their engine numbers is available to the
public. Their “Fordex and Ford Facts ’
has been posted to you.
What is the value of a copy of the Centen-
e.rary edition, in good order, of Boswell's
“Life of Johnson” ? —2091.
Details too vague. If you refer to “Works
and Table Talk,” published in 1884 at 2s.
and Is., its value would be very small. Send
further particulars.
Prior to 1914 I had seven years' service
on the clerical staff of a life assurance com-
pany. Since the tear I have been on the
land. Would a life office consider an appli-
cation for a clerical position? What is
the usual procedure of a life comapny when
making staff appointments?. —22os.
Most of the positions advertised by life
assurance companies are for junior clerks
and canvassers. Senior clerks generally
graduate from the ranks. The companies
consider it better to engage youths and train
them. Apply to the various offices; your
war service and previous experience would
assure you consideration.
Where can I obtain the parts of a gramo-
phone?—2l42.
George Wollaston, 177 George-street,
Sydney; if asked he will post a catalogue of
all parts required and give advice.
A method of rendering solidified white-
lead fit for use? —2073.
Break into pieces over which pour a little
oil. Allow oil to be absorbed and repeat the
process.
Where can I learn book-keeping? —2l97.
As you are situated out back you will find
the correspondence course on book-keeping
conducted by the Technical College, Sydney,
suitable. The fee is fl Is. per term.
Is there a book dealing with power belt-
ing?—2llB.
“Belts for Power Transmission,” by W.
G. Dunkley (2s. 9d.), obtainable from
Dymock’s Book Arcade, 428 George-street,
Sydney. Mangrovite Belting Co. also issue
a booklet on the subject; copy posted.
D oes the N.S.W. Government buy farms
for returned men, and what assistance do
they give? —l97l.
The only properties that the N.S.W. Dept,
of Lands will consider for acquisition are
those allowing of subdivision into at least
five living areas, and where the vendor is
prepared to accept payment in debentures
for two-thirds of the purchase money, bal-
ance in cash. The Dept, of Lands has on its
hands various properties for which you can
apply, if you are desirous of acquiring land
under the Returned Soldiers’ Settlement
scheme. A list of these properties would be
forwarded on request. A successful returned
soldier applicant for a farm is eligible to
apply for an advance of £625 for stock and
plant, unless it has previously been deter-
mined that no advance would be made in
respect of that block.
(1) Are residents outside the State elig-
ible to join the N.S.W. Police Force? (2)
Where should recruits apply? (3) What
are the age and physical qualifications for
both mounted and foot branches? (4) Rates
of pay for beginners? (5) Are applicants
being accepted? (6) What examinations
have to be passed? (7) Where do I apply
for information concerning the S.A. Police
Force? —1989.
(1) Preference for appointment is given
to residents of the State. (2) Personal
application should be made at the Police
Depot, Bourke-street, Redfern, Sydney. (3)
Applicants must be over 21 and under 30
years of age, sft. 9in high in bare feet
and list weight naked, for admission to
the mounted branch; sft. and list.
71b. for the foot branch. Chest measure-
ment, 39in. inspiration mounted, and 39|in.
foot. Applicants for the mounted branch
must be single men. (4) Pay commences at
16s*. 7d., less 4 p.c. for superannuation. (5)
Yes, but there are no vacancies in the
mounted branch. (6) A medical examination
and also an education test in simple arith-
metic and dictation. (7) Police Commis-
sioner’s Office, Adelaide, S.A.
Does a lapse of time invalidate a slander
action? —2311.
As a general rule, to rest on one’s legal
rights for an unreasonable time is a presump-
tion that such rights, if they existed, have
been abandoned.
The lambing on my area in N.Q. is very
poor. Is the cause the lack of green
feed?— 22o2.
For effectually mating vitality must be
increased, and as irrigation and green
feed seem to be out of the question, the only
resource is artificial feeding and a liberal
supply of a mineralised medicated lick. Begin
to feed as soon as the condition of the
sheep show’s that the grass is going off, and
keep up a supply of lick the year round. Use
at least three per cent, of rams, and yard the
mob two or three nights a week for six
weeks. If the rams won’t work when in
good condition the climate must be regarded
as unsuitable for sheep-breeding.

if carefully clipped—not pulled—in June,
July and August, but once the warm weather
arrives and the fruit becomes fully ripe decay
sets in. There should be a period of drying
until the rind is tough —up to 14 days. This
should be done in the open. From two to
three weeks after clipping examine tor
decayed fruit. Place in paper-lined cases and
store in a cool place, ventilated but out or

General Motors Service Everywhere
JT is General Motors policy to have right
service available all over the world, to
owners of General Motors cars. To this end
there is located in each of Australia s five
States a General Motors plant, each one of
which is the headquarters for General Motors
Service in that State.
Here Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile,
Oakland, Buick, La Salle, Cadillac and Vaux-
hall cars are made ready for delivery to
General Motors dealers.
Complete stocks of parts for all General
Motors cars are carried —in order to serve
dealers promptly, and in order that dealers
can serve you promptly and efficiently.
From these plants General Motors experts
aid dealers in establishing parts and service
facilities and in training Australian workmen
for efficient service work.
As rapidly as possible Australian dealers
are aided in establishing standard General
Motors service practices to the end that every
owner of a General Motors car shall receive
efficient, economical service from his General
Motors car.
General Motors cars are everywhere—
and General Motors service is everywhere.
Wherever you buy your car —wherever you
travel—whichever General Motors car you
buy—somewhere near you there is a General
Motors dealer who is able and willing to serve
you.
Each year General Motors grow —as each
year more people learn that General Motors
cars give the utmost in quality and value,
and that everywhere General Motors service
facilities are constantly being improved and
increased.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Bartle, the Sydney horseman, used to be
regarded as a mere “pony jockey”—smart at
getting his mount away from the barrier and
not much good otherwise. But Eric Connolly
saw merits in the young man, and his sup-
port and advice have made a difference.
For the shrewd Victorian Baiffle got Murillo
home in the Metropolitan, and he has a
very good chance of heading the jockeys’
list in Sydney this year. At Randwick on
Saturday he was successful in three of the
five races on the flat. He wasn’t called upon
to exert himself much on Greenline (7 to 2)
in the Flying Handicap, the Greenstead
gelding being much too good at the weights
for Quixotic, Lile Queen (each 20 to 1) and
10 others; but his well-judged and extremely
vigorous finish was the deciding factor in
the Three-year-old Handicap and the Novem-
ber Handicap. In the former race, Sarigue
f 6 to 1), a big grey colt by Sarchedon —
Peaceful’s Daughter, beat Rosso (3 to 1),
Shamash (6 to 1) and 11 others; in the
November Handicap Lady Constance (14 to
1) accounted for Night Heron (8 to 1),
Grosvenor (25 to 1) and 13 others.
Lady Constance and Greenline are trained
by ex-jockey Jimmy Barden, as also is
Golden Music (4 to 1), winner of one of
the two-year-old races —a very promising
gelded son of Rossendale —Golden Cello
owned by A. G. White. Barden was not
confident of Lady Constance, as a mile and
a half was thought to be beyond her, but
she came fast at the right moment and de-
prived Night Heron of a race that had looked
a certainty for him at a mile and three
furlongs. The boy on Night Heron was of
small assistance to him, but Teddy Keys
should pick up a good stake with the hope
of his stable before long—at Christmas-time
perhaps. Lady Constance is the first off-
spring of Chrysolaus to stay 12 furlongs—
which, incidentally, she ran in 2min. 334 sec.
Some stout Trenton blood was transmitted
to her on the dam’s side.
Thus far the bookmakers had had. much the
better of the argument, especially as Black
Douglas, a Rossendale colt; had given them
almost a “skinner” in a division of the
Nursery Handicap; but Matthews, one of
their number, relieved them of some of their
profits in the Highweight Handicap. He had
to take a short price about his Melbourne
purchase, Preposterer, who closed at twos,
but the money was never in doubt. Preposterer
is trained by Poison and ridden by Pike —a
formidable combination. Ariedon and Les-
boo, a likely-looking country horse, simplified
matters for the favorite by obligingly run-
ning out wide at the home turn; Nolens
Volens (7 to 1) came home pretty well in
second place, and the unlucky Lovebox was
third.

Maiden Handicap : Firefly; next, St. Bees.

Melbourne’s down-the-line clubs have come
into their own again. There are people who
prefer the kind of sport they provide to that
served up at Flemington or Caulfield, and
there was a very large crowd at Epsom on
Saturday. So many youngsters accepted for
the Two-year-old Handicap that the affair
had to be divided. The first division was
taken by a 10-to-l shot in St. Lucia, a smart-
looking St. Anton filly belonging to book-
maker Wally Mitchell and trained by Yin.
O’Neill. She galloped the four furlongs in
50sec., but this time was beaten in the
second division by Crowdel, who started
equal favorite with Shadow King at 3 to 1
and scored very easily, the clock showing
49£sec. Crowdel is a bay colt by imported
THE RIGHT SHAPE.
MISS MASHIE (to holiday-
resort chemist): “Have you
anything in the shape of
— ah—golf balls?”
MERRY SOUL: “Only pills and
mothballs.”
Crowdennis —Delysia. His sire is certainly
beginning to make his presence felt at the
stud.
Highland had disappointed the Holt stable
so often that the rush to back him for the
Open Handicap was rather surprising. He
went out at 10 to 9 on. The good thing duly
arrived, but it was no cakewalk, as old War-
anton (0 to 1), showing his first glimpse of
form for some time, made a race of it; the
useful Honorium, an early winner when
backed (S 3 to 1 was the price on Saturday),
was third. Duncan rode the Queensland
horse, who left the six furlongs behind in
lmin. 14sec.
There were 10 starters for the chief event
of the day, the Epsom Handicap. Spearset
(7 to 4), who had been successful in a simi-
lar event during the week at Moonee Valley,
was supposed to be the best bet of the after-
noon, but was never in the hunt. David Gar-
rick (7 to 1) winning easily by a length
and a half from Durability (6 to 1), who
had made most of the pace. Smoke Bomb (5
to 1) being two lengths further back; the
time was 2min. Bsec. David Garrick is a
Comedy King gelding, and a rather uncertain
customer, but he is smart enough when he
takes it into his head to gallop. He is owned
by S. Kennon and trained by J. H. Davies.
Scanlon rode him.
Bob Lewis was on top of a hot favorite
in the Trial Welter, his mount, Soldier’s
Hope, going out at sto 4 on. Soldier’s Hope
never had a hope, and was beaten out of a
place; Symballo (5 to 1), an Emblematic
celt, trained by Dick Bradtield for W. E. J.
Craig, just beat the fast-finishing Sports-
master (15 to 1) and Duke Traquair (12
to 1). Symballo is very i.ir from being a
Patron or a Portsea, as Bradtield would be
the first to acknowledge.
H= ■* * *
“lan C.”: Vic. Labor Government’s Tote
Bill, of which Chief See. Prendergast has
charge, makes it compulsory for racing clubs
within 30 miles of Melbourne to establish
the machine on their courses when ordered
by the Governor-in-Council. Other clubs can
get it by applying for a permit. There is no
ban on McShortodds. Ten p.c. is to be
deducted from the amount toted on a race;
the Government will take 5| p.c. and un-
claimed divs., and the clubs 4j p.c. and frac-
tions of sixpences. The rest of the bill con-
sists of machinery clauses and provision for
making regulations. Some Laborites will try
in Caucus or in the House to have the
machine placed under direct State control,
but they won’t succeed. Four will vote against
any sort of tote. McPherson, Lawson and a
few other Nats, and Cockies will decline to
support the bill because it does not wipe
out the man with the bag. Now that it is for
the first time sponsored by a Government the
measure lias more than a fighting chance in
the Assembly, but its fate in the Uppah
Chambali is uncertain. The more it is demon-
strated that the Ministry is in earnest the
greater the support the tote will command.
“Mitch”: That vicious animal the incon-
sistent racehorse has come into further
prominence in Melbourne. The nag in the
limelight, starting at threes in a field of five,
finished fifth. Great was the surprise of the
multitude and of the stipendiary stewards
when, a few days later, he beat a bigger and
better field, at tens. The owner of the
erratic animal, when hauled upon the mat,
said lie had booked a wager of £3OO the first
time and had a mere £2O on when victory
smiled. The “stipes” found that £lOO had
been the amount of the wager on the first
occasion, and “severely reprimanded” the
gentleman for his imperfect memory or some-
thing of the sort. Of what value, anyway,
is the investigation of booked bets? The
horse and the horse’s performances should
constitute the field of inquiry.
* * * *
“Ike Mcßagg”: I have more than once
called attention to the desperate financial
condition in which the bookmaking brother-
hood has landed itself through heavy losses,
as reported in the daily press, at one meeting
after another. A striking instance of the
straits to which members of the profession
are reduced is reported from Brisbane. In
that unfeeling city a penciller was prose-
cuted for using the same betting tickets over
again. The poor fellow used, to put his
stamped tickets in his bag when they were
returned to him. instead of tearing them up.
When opportunity offered, he > erased the
record of the previous bet and issued the
same ticket for a new wager. A charge was
laid against him, and before the Bookmakers’
Union could declare everybody “black” a
callous minion of capitalism had fined him
ten of the best or a moon in the Boggo-road
cooler behind the fly-screens.
* * * *
“Knavesmire”: A London picture-paper
recently published a photograph showing the
inside of liandwick’s tote, with piles of
banknotes and the couple of revolvers which
banks and other concerns handling cash in
quantities keep handy as a matter of course.
The heading was, “Will England Ever ,Come
to This?” Instead of insinuating that the
revolvers were necessary as a safeguard
against the predatory Australian, demoral-
ised by machine-betting, the journal might
have told the truth about the conditions pre-
vailing on English racecourses. There the
Tommies have had to organise a force of
“minders” to protect them from blackmailing
gangs armed with knuckledusters, knives and
razors. It is difficult to tote or
kick its ribs in if it won’t part up. In any
case, a couple of revolvers are less expensive
than the maintenance of bodyguards. In
no Australian instance have the revolvers
ever been used, whereas the operations of
the gangs of ruffians who infest British race-
courses have attained world-wide notoriety.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Bob Miller, a lightweight from Ireland,
fought New Yorker Jack Pilkington at Sydney
Stadium on Friday night, and got a points
decision at the end of 15 rounds. It was a
far from satisfactory performance on the
part of the American, for, after outfighting
the Irisher and putting him down for eight
seconds in the second round, Pilkington
appeared to lose interest in the final result.
He performed so “unenterprisingly” that
referee Joe Wallis felt impelled to urge him
to, get a move on as he dawdled through
the seventh stanza. Then the Yank spurted,
only to run into a couple of gloves under
the impact of which he went to the canvas
for seven and six seconds, in quick succes-
sion. Miller, who scaled 9st. 111 b
more than the American—j-was clearly en-
titled to the verdict. He is a tough lad,
and game. The other pug will need to
sharpen up if he wishes to retain his popu-
larity.
* * * *
Always more of an expert trickster than
a fighter, Hughie Dwyer, now a veteran,
was able to make A 1 Burke look like a novice
in their match at Leichhardt. The New-
castle lad is painfully green, and it was silly
to pit him against such a box of tricks as
his opponent. Burke did all the forcing
while Dwyer scored points for artful eva-
sion. In the 13th round Dwyer took delivery
of a low punch, and the referee, declaring
it too low, indicated that the old ’un was
the winner. Dwyer weighed lOst. 6 Jib.;
Burke was 21b. lighter.
* * * *
The onlookers at Melbourne Stadium on
Saturday night dusted few chairs, the pro-
gramme failing to hit the popular taste.
In a 10-round bout Kid Dale (lOst. 51b.)
had as opponent Bert Jenkins (lOst. OJlb.),
the Fighting Milkman. Milko tried hard to
land a convincing right, but the “Hid,”
though past his prime, knew too much for
him —Dale on points. In a 15-round wind-
up. Wal Tullipan (list. 9flb.),
land, outpointed Dick Elmour (list, lib.),
of France. The aggressive attitude of the
Queenslander and the apparent weight of
one or two rights that flew past Dick’s
chin at 90 m.p.h. got the small crowd
mildly interested for a while, but when it
was clear that there would be no knockout
it relapsed into its original lethargy. Tulli-
pan the winner.
* * * *
“Strangler”: The wrestling boom, for
which Melbourne has no further use, has
reached Sydney with a vengeance. Eleven
thousand people crowded into the Stadium
on Monday night to sec Walter Miller
(U.S.A.) John Kilonis (Greece) give
an exhibition of biting, gouging, kneeing, ear-
and hair-pulling and showmanship, with (now
and then) a bit of catch-as-cateh-can.
Kilonis has a reputation for - frightfulness
to maintain. He was responsible for most of
the dirty work, but occasionally his friend
the enemy retaliated in kind. Miller won in
the seventh round, getting the only fall with
a body press. (Kilonis had won at the
previous meeting, so, in a way, it was Mil-
ler’s turn.) The audience, most of whom
attended solely to enjoy Kilonis’s allegedly-
murderous methods, treated the descendant
of Leonidas with ungrateful contumely,
hooting him vigorously.

ROMANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"Mr. Dan Carroll told the Commonwealth Film
Commission that his firm had brought a distinguished
American scenario-writer, Miss Meredyth, to Sydney
to study local conditions. After months of investi-
gation, and careful research in the Mitchell Library,
that lady had pronounced that the only truly national
subject out of which Australian producers could
make a picture was horse-racing.”
No theme for stage romances
Or thrilling filmland fancies
Except the beast that prances
Or streaks along the course?
Well, beggars can’t be choosers,
And if her dictum’s true, sirs,
It’s time you flick-producers
Got busy with the Horse.
Give heed to what she preaches.
Scrap station life and beaches,
Grey plains and river reaches
And Lome and Cora Lynn.
Scrap towering gums and streams that
Our bards inspire. It seems that
Such things are not the themes that
We’re interested in.
Take us from axemen felling
Tall trees, or stockmen spelling,
To where the books are yelling
In thund’rous tone their quotes.
Show us the gladsome bustle,
Of flailing jocks a-tussle,
The crowds that surge and hustle
Around the tempting totes.
Seek ’mid their hum and clamor
Romance’s gleam and glamor,
The heart-thrills that enamor.
In this Australian clime
’Tis vain to throw your glances
On bushland’s wdde expanses:
Alack! there no Romance is,
You do but waste your time.
No need, scenario-plotter,
By flood or field to potter.
Tales to make blood run hotter
You’ll never find therein.
Meanwhile there’s Randwick calling
And Flemington a-bawling;
And, when King Horse grows palling,
Well, there’s the Hare of Tin.

Four coal-black horses dash furiously into the Circus Ring guided

Poised upright on the bare backs of a pair of wild and wicked

During the most intricate manoeuvres his mastery is unshaken.
He poses nonchalantly in the maddest whirl of galloping steeds with

“Mitt Shover”: How true it is that the
world has no time for a man who has gone
under in the battle of life! Everybody is
down on him, like crows on a wounded
brother. Take the case of poor Jack Demp-
sey, shorn of his championship glory, and
left with nothing but a measly million dahlers
or so to solace him. Johnno invested some
of his savings in the new Madison-square
Garden in Noo Yark. He bought 6000
shares, in fact. His first dividend lias been
an order from the Boxing Commission to
show cause why he should not be dealt with,
it being against N. York rules for a fighter
to have any financial interest in a boxing
club. So it looks as if Jack will have to
retire from the Game altogether or with-
draw’ his £30,000 —that is what his invest-
ment is worth at present quotes.
Racquet and Bawl
“Baseline”: In spite of the inter-State
games with Victoria, the visit of the French-
men and the Davis Cup trials, N.S.W. will
endeavor to send a representative team to
Perth for the big Westralian tournament at
Christmas (B. 10/11/’27). The Ma State
is powerful enough to furnish a side that
would give a good return for the exes.
Westralia is willing to spend. Some of the
most promising country players and such
coming youngsters as Donohue may get a
chance.
* * *
“Glenelg”: South Australians Ern Rowe
and G. M. Hone are not letting the grass
grow under their feet. They were playing
in exhibition games with Gerald Patterson at
Nliill (Vic.) on Saturday, and were to have
left Adelaide for Melbourne yesterday to
take part in the Victorian championships.
Rowe has been asked to come to Sydney for
the Davis Cup trials beginning on December
10. If, as is suggested, he is going back to
the Holy City before making the trip to Syd-
ney, he W’ill need an aeroplane.
* * * *
“Skyridsr”: If “Huffin-Guffin” had ever
faced a few of the “soft balls” he writes
about (B. 17/11/'27), he would have more
respect for them. Plenty of cricketers are
enthusiastic tennisers, and vice versa, and
there is very little “tea-party” about the
games played by Patterson, the Willards
and the like. One well-known sporting
family of Marulan (N.S.W.), the Sielers,
play cricket and tennis equally w T ell, and
both Aub and Les can put enough force
behind the “soft” ball to effectually lift it
out of the tea-party department. If “Huffin-
Guffin” saw’ some of the country boys on the
court after doing 10 hours on the farm his
fears would evaporate.

“Lilywhite”: It has been suggested that
J. O. Anderson will apply for reinstatement
as an amateur. There is nothing in the rules
to prevent his readmission. A cricket pro,
has only to announce his intention of renoun-
cing the cash, and to show that he is keeping
his word, to be taken back into the fold.
Even the sacrosanct Rugby Union asks no
more of one repenting save that he give up
his. evil ways and abase himself in the dust
before it if he would be forgiven. What
Anderson has to gain by asking to become
an amateur again it is not easy to see, unless
he still has ambitions to figure in Davis Cup
contests. Outside that he is in just the
same position as he was when he was styled
an amateur. He has the additional satisfac-
tion, too, of knownng that his professional
status is open and above board, and not
carelessly camouflaged under a veil of
amateurism, as is so often the case.
The Ins and Outs
“Hotham”: R. L. Park got among the
runs once more on Saturday. He made 144
for South Melbourne against University.
The doctor hasn’t taken the game seriously
of late years. With a return to his fine form
of six or seven years ago (and he is young
enough, given the necessary application) he
would be a tower of strength to the Vic.
XI. In 1920 he made 228, 104 and 152 for
Vic. v. S. Aus., and 111 v. N.S.W.; in 1921
he scored 100 and 122 v. N.S.W. Though
never a Harry Graham in point of attractive-
ness, he was always sound.

“Tenth Slip”: No new stars shot into the
cricket firmament during “country week” in
Sydney. Riverina returned home with the
honors, having gone through without a
defeat. The side did not meet Newcastle,
whose O’Brien wms about the best of the
bowlers. O’Brien, who used to play in Syd-
ney, was given a trial in a couple of inter-
state games last year, and then dropped.
He deserves another chance, as also does
Nicholls, a fast bowler from the Hawkesbury,
with the true fast-bowler’s flight off the
pitch. This season, playing grade cricket
with .Cumberland, Nicholls has taken 21
wickets for an average of 15.
❖ H- $ H*
“Shrewsbury”: The captain and wicket-
keeper of the Far North team wffiich played
in Sydney last week is a son of the late
Percy McDonnell, one of the most delight-
ful fast-scoring batsmen Australia ever pro-
duced. The son is a clever ’keeper, but lie
will never be as great as his father was with
the bat. Percy’s innings on a bad wicket
at Old Trafford, in which he made 90-odd
while Alec Bannerman amassed four runs,
is still quoted as a classic of the game. His
effortless off-driving was the great feature
of his play, and few batsmen of his type
kept the ball down better or got more pace
on it. A N.S.W. man, he went in his later
days to Brisbanje, where he played for
several seasons before his death there. Percy
visited England in 1880, ’B2, ’B4 and ’BB,
being captain on the last occasion. In 34
Test innings he made 969 runs, with a
highest score of 147 and an average of
29.09. In all matches in 1888 he headed
the run-getting list with 1393.
* * * *
The resumption of grade cricket in Syd-
ney was chiefly remarkable for a dazzling
199 by Allan Kippax for Waverley against
Marrickville. Kippax pelted the bowling
all over the place, and is evidently going to
pile up a power of runs again this season.
Veteran Charles Ivelleway had a field day
against the Manly batsmen; he took 6 for
33, and virtually scored a 4-point win for
his club. A pity lie cannot reconsider his
decision to stay out of the inter-State games.
There is a lot of good bowling left in him
yet—better than anything being exhibited by
those following in his footsteps.

“Get-er-bag”: One feature of the Shef-
field Shield season will warm the hearts of
those steadfast followers of the gams who
order the conduct of the big matches on
Sydney C. G. from “the Hill.” For the price
of admission has been reduced to a “bob.”

excuse to charge eighteen pence. There is
still a little lacking in the old hands’ cup of
happiness, and that Is the disappearance of
the cement cycling track. To hurl empty
bottles on that track was balm to the soul
fed up with sticky batting or off-theory bowl-
ing. The tinkle of the breaking glass was
a gentle lullaby, and the perspiring activi-
ties of the policemen attempting to locate
the throwqrs in that packed and thoroughly
loyal crowd made one glad to be alive and
cool.

“Woolloongabba”: The Queensland XI to
meet N.S.W. in the first Sheffield Shield
match, which begins in Brisbane at the
week-end, includes Hornibrook, who is back
to something like his old form with the
ball; Amos, the Marrickville right-hand spin
bowler who played for N.S.W. against
Queensland in the same match last year:
and Notliling, who has also worn the blue
blazer of the Ma State. A good bowler on
his day, and a punishing batsman, Nothling
ought to do well for his native State with
greater opportunities for cricket than were
available when he was studying medicine.
Amos is another who may rise to the occa-
sion. He has a nice easy action, and is
dangerous with the new ball.
“Shrewsbury”: Though Hendren has
reached Adelaide after his bad bout with
pleurisy in Colombo, the Middlesex crack
is in no shape, as yet, to take up active
duties as coach for the South Aus. C. A.
The doctors have told him to keep off any-
thing like violent exertion, and it will be
some time before he can get to work on the
collection of colts which S.A. has been care-
fully nursing against his arrival. “Patsy’s”
comment on the English team for next year
is interesting. He thinks that both Jupp
(Northamptonshire) and Larwood (Notts)
will prove tougii customers with the ball on
this side, while Maurice Tate is as good as
ever. Hammond he describes as a really
great batsman, and, all going well, Hobbs will
be Sutcliffe’s partner once more; Percy Chap-
man will probably com* as skipper. Likely
’keepers are George Brown, a Hampshire
stumper-batsman who has figured in Tests
in England, and Ames, a youngster from
Kent. “Patsy” himself hopes for another
chance. He will not play in the Sheffield
Shield games; to do so would upset his
qualification for Middlesex, to which county
he is under contract to return at the end of
each Australian season.
* * !|s *
“Aigburth” : Many an Australian wall hear
with regret that W. 11. Lockwood, one of
the greatest fast bowlers England has pro-
duced, is dead at 59. Tall and well-propor-
tioned, Lockwood took a long run, even for a
speed merchant, and his arm came over with
a beautiful high action that was a model for
aspiring imitators. He came to Australia
with Stoddart’s first team in 1894-95, and
with his great Surrey coadjutor Tom Rich-
ardson made a fast-bowling double which
has not been excelled, even by the Gregury-
Macdonald combination in 1920-21. In Test
matches Lockw’ood took 43 wickets for
an average of 20.55. and he had some bats-
men to get out in those days. Peidiaps his
greatest feat was in the fourth Test at
Manchester against Darling’s 1902 side,
which included Trumper, Duff, Clem Hill,
Noble, Darling, Syd Gregory and Armstrong.
Lockwood took 6 wickets for 48. and 5 for
28 —and yet England lost the match. A
really good batsman when he liked, he had
an average of over 17 in the Tests, with a
highest score of 52 n.o.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey” : While the diehards continue to
point out that golf is a game for the middle-
aged and the old, the youngsters persist in
mopping up the records. A 19-year-old
Sydney golfer, W. Ilore, played a full
round at the Bonnie Doon links in the
morning and another at Moore Park in the
afternoon (lie belongs to the Moore Park
club), and broke the club record at each
course, his figures being 71 for Bonnie Doon
(four threes) and 63 for Moore Park (nine
threes). On his own course the young
fellow was never higher than fours; at
Bonnie Doon he took fives at three holes,
only. Extraordinary consistency for a whole
day’s plav on different courses.
*v jj: *
“Baffy”: The S. Aus. professional golf
championship has been won at Seaton by
Rufus Stewart, the Australian open cham-
pion. Stewart has been in magnificent
form of late; his hard, low driving in the
teeth of a strong wind on this occasion was
an object-lesson in adaptation to conditions.
He went round the first time in 69, and
finished with a total of 299. F. W. Mc-
Mahon. with 304. was runner-up.
* * % *
“Villager”: There is always a big entry
for the Manly club’s open mixed foursomes,
but Saturday’s muster of 446 players cracked
all records; the first players were shoved off
at 8.40 a.m. and the last finished at 6.45
p.m. Officials had a whale of a time keep-
ing them moving. A pair from Killara, N.
H. Francis and Mrs. Pennefather, returned
the best scratch score, being four down on
Bogey, which was 78. J. C. Morell and Mrs.
Targett, with a 10 handicap, finished one
up on the Colonel. But the best performance
among the takers of handicaps was that of
A. Leone and Mrs. Morgan (5), who finished
all square.
* * * *
“Ploughman”: The Royal and Ancient
club, which has its abode at St. Andrew's,
Scotland, recently despatched a team of
gowfers to tour South Africa—Cyril Tolley,
H. D. Montmorency, C. O. Hezlett and A.
G. Pearson. The team had a tough go in
its first game at Capetown; Tolley and
Pearson lost in the singles, while Hezlett
halved and Montmorency won. Success in
the foursomes enabled the visitors to get
home by a point, which argues some class
in their opponents. One hears little of South
African golfers in the English and European
tourneys, though Australians often figure
conspicuously in them. This is the more
surprising, since the game is widely played
in the Union, and the standard of the Afri-
kander in other pastimes is high. It would
add a pleasing variety to Australian golf
if the authorities were to approach the
South African governing body with a request
for a visit from a Springbok team. The
latter might take in Maoriland as well.
Car and Cycle
“0.H.V.”: The motor speed battle between
Bull and the Yankees proceeds. Following
on Segrave’s wonderful performance in a
1000-li.p. Sunbeam car, one of the American
factories designed a ’bus on something the
same lines which is estimated to be able to
do 220 m.p.h. It isn’t built yet, and may
not be as fast as is expected, but Coataleu,
the Sunbeam designer, is taking no chances.
He has on the stocks a 1200 h.p. monster
which ho reckons will touch 250 m.p.h. Un-
like the machine Segrave drove, which had
engines fore and aft and a four-wheel drive,
the new British speed-waggon will have two
600-h.p. engines, synchronised and set side
by side in the usual position. It will have a
pear-shaped body, tapering to the rear, and
enclosing everything—wheels and all. The
front wheels will have an exceptionally wide
spread, and the rear axle will be very short,
bringing the driving wheels close together.
But it isn’t yet certain that tremendously
high power will win the day. The makers
of the Stutz (American) car have produced
a 80-h.p. ’bus which lias done 178 m.p.h.
and experiments with lightweight, moderate-
pow'ered cars are likely to be continued.
* # * *
“Garry” : With the development of small-
cylindered high-compression engines, “knock-
ing” has made itself more and more of a
nuisance. In older days you couldn’t get
a knock out of an engine unless you either
misadjusted the carburetter, put the ’bus at
an impossible grade, or starved the engine
of oil. But these new little engines make
their protest at unexpected times because
under the high-compression petrol explodes
in a series of bangs instead of gradually and
sweetly, as was so intended. The first
remedy applied was two plugs to a cylinder;
then ether and nitro-benzine were added to
the petrol. The latest dope is tetraethyl
lead, the effect of which is to provide a
whole battalion of sparkine- plugs, ensuring
regular and progressive combustion. The
lead particles combine with the oxygen in
the mixture and form lead’ oxide, and the
particles of lead oxide become white-hot just
a fraction of a second before the electric
spark ignites the whole charge. The fumes
of the exhaust are horribly poisonous, and if
the use of doped fuel is to continue, exhaust
filters will have to be provided.

“Der Jong”: A good motor reliability
stunt was brought off recently in South
Africa. A standard Chrysler “70” set out
to scoot round the Union in high gear at
the rate of 354 m.p.h. The distance, 3175
miles, was covered in the running time of
89 hours and 26 minutes. Three mountain
ranges, including the mighty Drakensberg,
had to be crossed and re-crossed during
the run, and South African roads are no
better than Australian, while the heights to
be climbed are far higher than anything
we have on this side of the world. The car,
driven by G. S. Bouwer, was the one which
last year easily beat the Union express from
Jo’burg to Capetown.

"Duggio": Sydney’s famous motor speed-
way at Maroubra lias lost a lot of money
for its promoters in the two years since it
was completed. The broad concrete track
with its saucer-like banking cost, with acces-
sories, £42,000. There were good attend-
ances at the first few meetings, but Mar-
oubra is a long way out and the tramway
service not of the best. Several months
ago the co. sold the track to J. S. Taylor,
(•no of the original shareholders, for £10,850.
The purchaser re-sold to another co., which
planned to introduce night trotting; but the
plans went awry, and motor-racing didn’t
pay rent and interest, even on the much
reduced capitalisation. The co. wasi in-
debted to J. S. Taylor, who put in a receiver.
He has now bought the property for £2500.
The speedsters are wondering what is to
become of the track. When Australia has
a motoring industry of its own it might
come in handy as a testing ground, on the
lines of England’s Brooklands.

“Whizz”: Details of the great 24-liours
run by • a Voison car at Moutlhery (B.
6/10/’27) appear in some of the European
trade journals. With three men driving
alternately, 2724 miles were covered in the
double round of the clock, the average speed
being close on 114 m.p.h. Going on, the
car covered 5000 kilometres (3100.5 miles)
before the drivers called it a day. The car’s
engine was a straight eight sleeve-valve
Knight, with 05 x 140 m.m. bore and stroke,
and 7939 c.c. The engine had cast-iron
sleeves, two Zenith carburetters fitted
with an air filter, coil ignition, and wire
wheels 33in. by 5.35 in.

“Self-Starter”: Recent extraordinary per-
formances by so-called “stock” cars have led
many to suspect that the jiggers in question
were really camouflaged racers, or, at least,
carefully-tuned cars fitted with special gad
gets for the performance of the advertising
stunt. The Americans, who specialise in
stock-car records, are evidently of the same
mind, for the American Automobile Associa-
tion bas just laid down the definition of what
constitutes a stock car. It must be a stan-
dard model, catalogued, advertised and on
sale as such through the regular trade chan-
nels. No changes or alterations for such a
car competing in a stock-car event will be
permitted, save freeing of clearances in new
cars, not to exceed one and a half times the
published tolerances, and general greasing
and oiling.

“Humpyboiig”: The Brisbane Motor-
Cycle Club’s 24-liours reliability trial, which
ended in five riders gaining full points (B.
3/11/’27), was supplemented by an eight-
hours. test to determine who should hold
the Walter Reed Cup, given for the original
contest. Four of the five riders, all steer-
ing side-cars, faced the starter; the other
was incapacitated by an accident. D. K.
Paine, riding a 9-11 Harley-Davidson, won
with full points for reliability, scoring
altogether 347 points out of a possible 350.
Frank Arthur, winner of the Golden Helmet
at Brisbane Speedway the previous night,
was second, also scoring full marks for re-
liability, but dropping 0 for time losses.
W. A. Wacker, riding with a broken fork-
spring, was in third place, with 337 points.
“Wheel”: Hubert Opperman’s sterling vic-
tory in the Dunlop Grand Prix road-race,
held in his native Victoria, is one more proof
that Australian cyclists, track or road, must
be numbered among the best in the world.
The race was over a route of 6901 miles,
covered in four days of actual riding; it
started and finished in Melbourne. Opper-
man, who collects £250 and the C. B. Ivellow
Cup, as well as various time prizes, covered
the distance in 40hr. 41min. 35sec., finishing
an hour ahead of the second rider, Maori-
h.nder Henry Watson; E. Bainbridge, who
is in the veteran class, was third. The
time is claimed as a world’s record.
Miscellaneous
The Waratahs scored another double last
week. Against Ulster, which included nine
of the Ireland side of the previous Saturday,
the tourists won by 11 to 3; and, crossing
the Channel, a somewhat seasick crowd de-
feated Northumberland and Cumberland by
14 to 9. The reserves were in evidence in
both matches, and did well; Sheehan seems
to have picked up his old form at five-
eighth.
* * * *
“Mallet”: An English croquet team
toddled ashore at Fremantle last week. Its
visit is causing intense excitement in croquet
circles, for England won “the ashes” a
couple of years ago, and Australia aspires
to wrest them from the arrogant invader. A
stern struggle, with no “beg pardons,” is
expected. Modern croquet is far removed
from the innocuous game of the 1860’s. In
some aspects it rivals golf, as anyone who
has seen one of its elderly exponents hit his
pet bunion while trying to “croquet” an
opponent could testify.
“Splash”: The announcement that Andrew
Charlton will appear at the Manly (.N.S.W.)
swimming carnival on Dec. 21 has roused a
general hope that the great distance swimmer
will, after all, be available for the Olympic
Games. As the Olympic swimming trials ore
to be held on January 14, Andrew will have
ample time to get fit if he intends to take
part in them.

“Splosh” : The N.S.W. Ladies’ Swimming
Association is trying to induce Joyce Cooper,
an English swimmerette, to visit Sydney in
February. Joyce is 17 years old, and is said
to hold several records for young persons of
her age. What these are exactly nobody
seems to know; anyway, they are sure to
be beaten in a day or two by Daisy Duck-
ling, aged 11, the 15/ds. champion of Little
Coogee. And if Daisy dies of heart failure
while being cheered on by the stunt press, a
flock of Fairies, Flossies and Bellas, all in
the infant class, will be ready to succeed her.
* * * *
“Splash” : After at first declining to have
anything to do with them, the N.S.W. swim-
ming authorities have decided to invite the
Germans Rademacher and Froelich to swim
under their auspices in Sydney. This change
of heart was due to the representations of a
deputation from Sydney’s German residents.
The visitors will show at the National Games
in January and the Australian champion-
ships in February.
“Toowong Reach” : Brisbane’s Commercial
Rowing Club celebrated its jubilee with a
regatta, followed by the customary feasting
and libations. Some of the after-dinner
speakers got nearly back to Noah’s Ark
in their reminiscences of the aquatic glories
of the club, which has bulked big in northern
rowing, and hung grimly on to existence, in
spite, of bad times and disastrous floods—
more than once its shed and boats bave been
destroyed. As was only fitting, the challenge

crew; it beat Toowong by half a length, with
G.P.S. third. The Commercials covered tlx

“Derwent”: Tasmanian rowing associa

carnival during iCliristmas week, and have
arranged with the shipping companies to
offer reduced fares and freight rates to
crews from other States, while crews unable
to bring their own boats will have these pro-
vided for them. The racing will be held at
New Norfolk on December 26, Franklin on
December 31 and Huon on January 2. These
places being only a few miles apart, little
travelling will be needed. Events will
include senior, junior and maiden eights and

none of that funny business,” he said to
Basher; “you’ve got the pea in your hand.”
“Have I?” Basher replied unabashed,
“Too true you have,” returned the mug; “I
saw you slip it between your fingers.”
With a deft movement Basher slid the pea
under a shell, and then exposed it to view
triumphantly. “That’s where you’re wrong,
Mr. Smartie,” he said. “And always re-
number this: honesty’s the best policy. I
ought to know; I’ve had a go at both.”

“Ride Off”: There is a chance of an
Indian Army polo team coming to Australia
in July. The prevalence of glanders, surra
and other diseases in India forbids the impor-
tation of horses from that country to Aus-
tralia, but it is hoped that the Australian
clubs will be able to supply the visitors with
sufficient high-class ponies. If this can be
arranged the visit is as good as settled.
The newly-formed Australian Polo Associa-
tion is now affiliated with Hurlingham, with
representation on the committee, and* will
take over future arrangements for an ex-
change of visits between Australian teams
and those of other countries.

in Europe outside the U.K., though the pur-
suit of deer and boar with special breeds of
hounds is common enough. The ban laid on
the importation to England of Danish pork
has given little Denmark a new idea. Thou-
sands of pigs arc now accumulating on the
country’s hands. It is proposed to train these
animal's to take the place of greyhounds and
pursue a lure of some sort or another round
a track. Trials, it is said, have been success-
ful, though the nature of the lure has
not been divulged. The only difficulty would
seem to be in distinguishing the acclamations
of the pigs, as they pursue their quarry, from
the vociferations of the bookmakers laying
the odds.

“Spike”: Evidently observing that the
N.S.W.A.A. wasn’t hurrying over raising
£2OO to send half a dozen athletes to Maori-
land, St. Joseph’s College has announced
that it will despatch Jim Carlton at its own
expense, if necessary. Victoria is sending
10 men at a cost of £4OO, and young can-
didates for selection arc to be coached. There
is a big difference in the way the two asso-
ciations run their affairs, and it must be said
that the Victorians are not only getting
better administrative but better athletic
results. The State, indeed, is the present
holder of the athletic premiership of Aus-
tralia and Maoriland.
* 5!: ❖ ❖
“Spike”: Another Australian schoolboy-
star has risen to rival the glory of
Carlton, of Sydney, and Davidson, of
Melbourne (B. 17/il/’27). This is L. M.
Smith, of Melbourne’s St. Stephen’s club,
who ran the 100 in 9 9-10 soc. in the inter-
club pennant competition. Carlton’s time
for the sprint was lOsec. dead, but he was
not so hard pressed as Smith, who was only
two-fifths of a second ahead of the second
man, Lane.
“Nark”: The tendency of N.S.W. athletic
bodies to object to the activities of the Fed-
eral organisations to which they are sup-
posed to be subordinate is increasing. Not
only has Noo South made faces at the Olym-
pic rowing authorities, and said things about
the Board of Cricket Control which my pen
would blush to repeat, but it has jibbed at
the .Olympic Council naming five selectors to
choose the Australian representatives for
Amsterdam. One of the five is, of course,
a N.S.W. man, and there are six States, but
Ma is not satisfied ; she has had the nerve
to ask that the Federal Council’s decision
be put to a postal vote. This will not be
done, however. It will be a distinct advant-
age to have a selecting body of five experts,
instead of the old unwieldy conference of
from 15 to 20 delegates, all fighting for the
inclusion of their own men regardless of
athletic merit; and there will be no going
back.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Boroni”: The opening of the Broken
Hill-Sydney railway makes commercially
possible the exploitation of the gypsum de-
posits near Ivanhoe. Gypsum finds a ready
market, but production costs and freight
rates have to be cheap and quality excel-
lent to give the N.S.W. product a chance
in competition with S.A. and W.A.
“N.M.L.”: In the many thousands of
bores which have been sunk in Australia
how much of value beyond water has been
discovered and utilised? With the exception
of the oil in the Roma bore, nothing. Surely
some of these pinholes must have bored
through minerals of commercial value and
quantity somewhere. Boring in Q. is so
harassed by regulations that one more
wouldn’t matter. If a driller of a bore had
to send to the Government Geologist a
sample of all strata in the hole, it might
lead to discoveries, especially if the dis-
coverers were allowed to share.
* * * *
“Sea Nomad” : The Manua recently came
into Thursday Island with a catch of 11
tons of trochus-shell, fished in seven weeks.
It realised £7O per ton —not a bad return for
an island vessel, captained and manned by
islanders, but exceptional, of course. Some of
the “boys,” by the way, have learned too
much. On the strength of what certain
grinning savages represented as a sample
bag full of first-class shell, a Chinese buyer
bought their whole catch. When he found
that the other bags were filled with second-
and third-class stuff, his wails nearly blew
the guns off the fort on the hill.
* * * *
“Sheep-buyer”: The rain in N.S.W. was
golden to the local sheepmen, but it has not
been an unmixed blessing to the Banana-
land pastoralist intent on replenishing his
depleted flocks. Queensland buyers had
been operating rather freely, prices in
N.S.W. being low enough to warrant the risk
of stocking up, even if the home situation
was still uncertain. With conditions still
dubious in the North buying at the enhanced
rates is, to many, out of the question. In
Queensland itself, young sheep in saleable
condition are almost unobtainable.
* * * *
“AdaL.” : Years ago when collecting in the
Macdonncll ranges, Centralia, I gathered a
sugar-bag full of more or less precious stones.
I had them cut and sent to Paris. The
cheque I received in return did not cover
expenses. Yet one could not buy similar
stones from our jewellers for less than half
a guinea apiece. The lesser gem stones
should be in great demand as mounts for
pins, brooches, sleeve-links and similar
articles.
* * * *
“S.M.” : A trade report from Washington
says that Australia is the United States’
“best customer for motor vehicles, is third
in the consumption of gasoline, and sur-
passes other foreign countries in purchases
of American machinery.” With all these
goods coming in it is no wonder that Aus-
tralia has so little except public works built
out of loans for its own people.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp” : Beethoven, Mozart
and other masters are dead, and so is the
original copyright over their music. To-day
the seeker after their pieces frequently finds
that he has to purchase a score “adapted”
for the piano or violin or some other
instrument (or mass of instruments) by
someone with a name like Pianobangsk or
Saxophoni. There is copyright over Piano-
bangsk’s and Saxiphoni’s adaptations, for
which, if they exist, they probably get a
few bob. If you want to play these “adapted”
classics in public you have to pay perform-
ing fees to people who have far less musical
ability but far more business acumen than
the masters who wrote the script.
Si= * *
“Sierra” : The four-masted barque Herzogin
(Voile, which won this year’s wheat race by her
passage of 88 days to' Queenstown, has just
gained fresh laurels by her 79-days’ trip from
the English Channel to Melbourne. She
and her sister ship the Herzogin Sophia
Charlotte were built about 25 years ago by
the Norddeutsclier Lloyd. They were probably
the fastest sailing-vessels built this century.
Manned by enthusiastic cadets (each ship
carried about 50), they made wonderful pas-
sages to Australia and the West Coast of
America. Sophia Charlotte w r as the last ship
to leave a Sydney wharf without the aid of
a tug. In February, 1905, she loosed sail
at Pyrmont wharf, passed Dawes Point with
skysails set, and travelled to the heads at 11
knots. On her previous voyage she landed a
cargo of wheat at Hull 76 days out from
Melbourne, and then ran from Hull to
Bremen in 82 hours. Her Finnish crews are
still keeping her up to her old mark.

SKF Research Laboratories Reveal
What the Price Tag Never Shows.
In five minutes’ time service conditions equal to two years are imposed on
samples of SKF-marked Ball Bearings and other types of anti-friction bear-
ings at our laboratories in Luton, Gothenburg, Philadelphia and Hofors.
And this is but one of the tests which brings to light the long life and service
inherent in SKF-marked Ball Bearings—something one does not visualise
when looking at the price tag.
These laboratories are thoroughly equipped with instruments of the highest
precision for scientific investigations, and manned by staffs of competent
engineers who have made the study of anti-friction problems a specialty.
Through the knowledge developed in this manner, these laboratories are of
vital assistance in the improved production and application of anti-friction
bearings, to the end that the SKF organisation will always live up to its
slogan, “SKF means the right bearing in the right place.”

STOCKINGS
In number six hundred, politicians, Phili-
stines, publicans and sinners swept up to
government House one night last week,
lhe social equivalent of the Pharisee
was there, too, enwrapped in the time-
defying aura that made the poor old
publican stand afar off. There was no
standing afar off, though, on this
occasion, for the rooms were a slowly-
shifting, gently-pushing crowd. Secretary for
Dominions Amery and his wife were the
centre of the party, and at nine o’clock, when
they came into the ballroom with the State
Exes., the fairest flower of Sydney society
wasn't above craning forward for a good
eyeful. In contrast to his square, almost
Buddha-like figure, her charm lies in an
almost ethereal lightness of figure. Her face
is long and thin and cast for melancholy;
but happiness has overtaken it, and lurks
in corners of the quickly-smiling mouth. The
night was very still, and this seemed a special
dispensation of Providence, as the entertain-
ment was a movie under the starry sky. Not
that the vice-regals had entirely depended on
Nature for their effects. On to the tennis-
lawns poured the rays from hundreds of ruby
lights, the paths before the wide verandahs
were picked out by rose-and-gold lanterns,
and the old Moreton Bay near the side gate
was a magic corner of golden light and leafy
shadow. On the lawn opposite the front ter-
race the Odyssey of the Amery tour was
flashed on the silver screen, accompanied
by the music of a brass-band. Later the
masses and the classes consumed champagne-
cup and oyster-patties, and altogether this
charge of the Light Brigade must cut quite
a breach in the Entertainment Allowance.
The frocking was of the sumptuous order.
Lady de Chair’s translucent-green satins
wore rhythmic sleeves of chiffon looped with
dmmente and dripping into crystal tassels.
I ms Neptune’s-daughter coloring was served
with pearls and topped by a diamond coronet.
Mrs. Amery’s frock was of the palest pink,
the skirt covered in a beaded fringe so fine
it looked like strands of silk, and a little cape
of the same beading swung from the
shoulders. Mrs. Tommy Marks also ex-
pounded the charm of pale pink, and another
of its snking devotees was George Fuller’s
lady, who held a levee within a levee over
her husband’s appointment as Agent-General.
Lady Hugh Poynter looked .Tunoesque in
old-gold lace and georgette, and Lady Cowan
walked in soft white satin, emblazoned with
a pheenix flaming triumphant above ashes of
crystal—a symbol evidently of Empire Trade.
The Moderator of the Kirk Assembly brought
his hat and bands and probably his hymn-
book. but checked that in the cloakroom.
dignitaries flew the Papal purple, while
the Salvation Army uniform enwrapped Com-
missioner Sowton and his wife. Premier
Bavin arrived surrounded by his family.
Mrs. Bavin’s petunia georgettes were separ-
ated at an early hour from daughter Shirley's
salad-green chiffons and the blues and sil-
vers of son John s best girl (she’s Marcia
Allen). Mrs. Theodore kept company with
Mrs. Kerr-Cameron, a tall daughter of that
James O’Grady who governs Tasmania;
tenor Walter Kirby communed with the
night; and the Swedish Consul attracted the
eye of warriors and diplomats, inasmuch as
he wore his decorations in a curve.
Grey skies and a cool sou’-wester took
most of the sparkle out of the conferring of
a Sydney M.A. on Dominions Secretary
Amery. The Great Hall was almost dark
when the Chancellor handed the genial little
statesman an Australian duplicate of his
Oxford title, and had it not been for the
scarlet-and-gold robes of the professors, and
the shining face of Judge Backhouse, the
spectacle would have been almost ’ dull
Though the women outnumbered the men by
three to one, coats and furs hid any gav
frocks, and Chancellor William Cullen in his
black and gold was easily the most pic-
turesque figure there.
While the Uni. was gowning her husband,
Mrs. Amery was dressing for the luncheon
spread for her by the National Council of
Women. Hundreds of women flocked to the
Wentworth to keep tryst with the mid-day
chop and to hear, as they liopM, Mrs.
Amery air some of her views. The chop
arrived, but the lady’s speech was no more
than a prettily worded “Thank you.” The
dining-room of the Wentworth was the
scene, and the crowded tables Were so close
together that the passing of the waiters was
something of a miracle. Down the length
of the_ table where sat those mighty in the
Council and the guest of honor, Dorothy
1 erkmg pinkly laughed and danced —seemed
f e n to twinkle a little roguishly when
.Lady (;Owan, very intense as usual, sprang
into the breach left by the shortness of
Mrs. Amery’s speech, and planted on the
ramparts the banner with the trade device
Made in Britain.” The lady with the
eager profile might be an exquisitely frockcd
female counterpart of Don Quixote or
Galahad. Her matter is excellent, but could
be made thrice excellent by the saving
grace of humor. However, her clothes make
a striking appeal, her frock on this occasion
being maize-colored, and her fascinating
droopy crin. hat wearing a wreath of orange
buds about its crown. Mrs. Amery’s frock
of dull blue marocain was strewn with a
subdued floral design and topped by a soft
turned back hat from which a tassel dangled
on the left side. Lady de Chair, who sticks
to green and gold with a persistence that
could npt be beaten by De Valera, wore these
colors in her frock, and repeated them in
a wide-brimmed hat which was a lyric to
Spring. The tall MacCallum lady presided,
and Dame Mary Cook made as good a speech
as any.
The fashionable dance of the week-end was
in H.M.A.S. Melbourne—a farewell flutter;
many of her officers have their faces set for
England. Commodore Hyde was the night’s
host, and looked mightily pleased with the
world at large.
There was a dance on the roof of the
Lyceum Club on Friday night, and as
it was in aid of the University appeal
a literary touch was given by one-third of
the dancers arriving dressed as the characters
from books and operas. The most striking
costume, however, was worn by the judge—
Etlielwyn Kirk, from Maoriland. She was
the Duchess from “The Marriage of Figaro,”
swanlike in spreading white moires. Art-
critic Bill Moore helped in the judging, and
the prize went to Mrs. S. E. Cook for a
clever impersonation of Betsy Trotwood.
Mrs. Moore was a striking figure, though
hardly flamboyant enough, as Mrs. Meagles;
and the president of the club, Mrs. Thomas,
had stepped out of Chaucer in her tight
amethyst velvet bodice and a long-trained
skirt of mauve satin, topped by the millinery
peculiar to the fourteenth century. Among
the bridge players the Mungo MacCallum
lady represented the Uni. in embossed lilac
georgette.
The gold anklet showing through the sheer
stocking of Eva Novak was the most talked-
of item at the Ivaritane fete on Saturday.
There was not a great attendance, but tlie
takings were, on the whole, satisfactory, and
tremendous excitement was caused by the
film star, after she had opened the fair, pos-
ing with babies in her arms before the eye
of the movie. One of her most interested
spectators was Nellie Stewart, who sat quite
unnoticed on the side of a grassy slope sur-
rounded by daughter Nancye and two small
grandchildren.
But Sweet Nell can’t always so easily
escape attention. A while ago she offered her
bright green-and-red' bungalow at Clifton
Gardens for sale ; and the “For Sale” notice
outside attracted such crowds of visitors, who
plainly were merely curious, that the invi-
tation to look within was hastily hauled
down.
Good looks and a voice the world will
hear are the dower of this lucky girl, Mollie
de Gunst. She is a pupil of Madame Chris-
tian, the St.
Vincent’s wiz-
ard at voice-
produc tion,
and has been
attracting the
attention o f
teachers and
critics for
many months.
T here was
even a whis-
per that the
liery Alda had
good-naturedly
promised t o
do all she
could for her.
But the ener-
getic girl is
doing quite a
lot for herself.
She is the
youngest of a
large country
family, of which no other member is even
interested in music excepting for delight in
Mollie’s voice.
B. E. Millingen came from Adelaide to
claim Girlie Dwyer, whose frock of fine white
lace, sparkling with pearls and diamente,
drew after it a brocaded satin train of
Chinese weave a furlong or so in length.
There was also a Limerick-lace veil lent by
Mrs. Jack Garry, of Binalong. Three maids
followed the decorative bride up the aisle of
St. Pat.’s; and they deserve a word to them-
selves, for they were like Dresden-china shep-
herdesses in their billowy frilled taffeta
frocks topped by straw bonnets all garlands
and ribands. The charm was carried out in
the shepherdess crooks they carried massed
with posies of yellow, mauve and blue —the
same hues as their frocks. The bride is
the only daughter of the Brundah Dwyers,
and dad first armed his daughter up the aisle
and later hosted a great party at the Ambas-
sadors.
St. Peters, in North Sydney, blessed the
vows that bind Enid Walsh to Clifford Johns,
of Melbourne. The bride, who was given
away by her father, kept her appointment in
an alluring mixture of ivory satin and old
lace, and was furthermore embellished with
a Court train, a tulle veil and a sheaf of
November lilies. Sister Muriel attended in
rose taffeta and tulle. Kailoa, the home of
the bride’s parents, enshrined the nuptial
chicken and asparagus in a riot of pink and
white roses, Mrs. Walsh presiding in black
lace and georgette.
Oliver Raymond, now of Albury, has in-
duced Sydney girl Eunice Weil to name the
day and date. The Raymond family has a
Roland for its Oliver; bridegroom-to-be’s
brother Roland, a N.S.W. Rhodes scholar
and inter-State footballer,, now helps to
look after the health of Five Dock.
Mr. and Mrs. H. J. Howes, of Bradley’s
Head, had no sooner cabled their “God bless
you, my children,” to daughter Dr. Jennette
and her new bridegroom, Herbert Marsh, m
Rangoon than the parental blessing was
besought by younger daughter Helene on her
engagement. She had gone to act as brides-
maid to big sister.
Ella Aiming, one of the pretty Aiming
twins from Ashfield, left last week by the
Mooltan for Colombo, where she- will become
Mrs. Leslie Walsh. Sister Evelyn and mother
have gone to help.
Marjorie Rowley, of Mosman, has pro-
mised to keep house in the early future for
Keith Maclean, of Ba, Fiji, elder son of the
late padre J. H. Maclean.
After Walter Kirby's concert in the Con.
Ruby Rich carried off the artists and a group
of friends to her flat in the Astor. Here
coffee and still more song were the chief
ingredients of a party that settled down to
real enjoyment in the small hours. Ruby, in
her concert-wrap that is like a moonlit water-
fall, sat at a piano lit by tall candles and
played accompaniments to old French, Ger-
man and Italian songs which the tenor sang
with the feeling of the true artist. Maurice
Moscovitcli, no longer the Terror but a tired-
looking man refreshing himself with quanti-
ties of thin hot tea and dry toast crisped to
a miracle (his supper every night), uttered
deep bravos, and waved his long, sensitive
hands in encouragement for encores. Dorothy
Mould, the good-looking songbird who had
been Walter Kirby’s assisting artist, colored
the rooms with the exotic charm of her
voice.
Gone are the days when no actor was
supposed to put red blood into his acting if
lie did not wash down several pounds of
steak a day with two or three bottles of
port or porter. The diet of Moscovitcli
isn’t a bit like that. For breakfast one large
plate of bran mixed with grapenut (it must
be large, for there will be no lunch), with
a lot of cream and a little milk; wholemeal
bread, thin and toasted crisply and heavily
buttered ; the whole washed down with very
weak and very hot tea. At half-past five,
dinner, fish boiled or grilled, a tomato, a
baked or stewed apple ; maybe some orange.
After the show, supper, which never varies
—crackling thin wholemeal bread and thin
hot tea. Between whiles four or five pints
of cold water. Yet nobody could say
Moscovitcli is not a full-blooded 100-per-cent,
lie-male on the stage.
At three o’clock next Saturday Bishop
D’Arcy-Irvine will dedicate the first church
on the Soldier Settlement at Matraville.
It will be known happily enough as St.
George’s. Dean Talbot and George Earp,
M.L.G., have strongly befriended this effort
to bring the church in closer touch with the
soldiers, many of them incapacitated, and
their families. Already over £lOOO is in
hand, and Padre Philip Westley hopes that
Sydney’s offerings will make it possible to
free the building of debt before the end of
the year. St. Mark’s Rectory, Long Bay, is
the address for your cheque.
To help equip the new Welfare Centre of
the Adult Deaf and Dumb Society in Eliza-
beth-street, a children’s Christmas party is
being organised by Mrs. Harry Dransfield
and an energetic committee for December
12. R.M.S. Maloja has been lent by the
P. and O. Co., which will also supply refresh-
ments and music, etc., for the children.
Among the attractions is a Christmas gift
stall, for which Mrs. Dransfield and Mrs.
J. J. Smith will be responsible. Lilian Gib-
son will arrange a concert in the music- room,
and there will be dancing on the lower deck.
The new Centre is making a widespread
appeal. Donations are coming in from the
various Elizabeths in the State who are
anxious to be identified with the furnishing
of the Elizabeth room, named after the
Duchess of York. Manly ladies, with Mrs.
A. A. Kemp as president, are furnishing the
Arts and Crafts room and are undertaking
to keep it supplied with instructors.
Sculptor Theo Cowan is in charge of the
Art stall, which will be a great feature of
the fete for the Crown-street Women’s Hos-
pital ou Saturday. The artists have re-
sponded handsomely to the call, and oils,
water-colors and black-and-whites signec
by well-known names are to be sold at less
than reasonable prices. The grounds of The
Knoll, the Albert Littlejohns’ home at Dar-
ling Point, is the war-zone.
Herewith Bernice Agar presents the ini-
p r e ssive-look-
ing wife of
George Fuller,
this State’s new
Agent-General.
She is an ex-
p e rienceo
hos t e ss, an
easy talker
and a clever
organiser. She
has been inti-
mately co n-
i) ected with
Sydney chari-
ties for two
decades, and
cue loss of her
clear judg-
ment and
quick decision
will be felt on
many com-
mittees.
It was a very hard-headed lady who left
Australia to make inquiries incidentally
about “the Webber Millions.” Not so long
ago the church that thrusts a shoulder out
into the Corso, at Manly, was shepherded by
Mr. Stoddart, and his wife was a Webber:
and there wasn’t much doubt that she was
one of the Webbei’s of the Millions. Of the
Stoddart family there is one who was all
through the war as a masseuse —first in
Egypt and then in France —and when she
left her business in Brisbane for a-holiday
in Italy in the early months of this year the
family suggested that she might go on to
Devon, where' the Webbers came from, and
inspect the family tree. She returned the
other day with the fixed idea that the tree
is a thoroughly sound vegetable, but that
ten millions to one would be fair odds to
offer about the Webber fortune.
The property that the millions are built
on lies in the heart of New York, and the
claim has its foundation, in a grant made
800 years ago. Everything about the early
history of this grant is misty; all that is
sure is that for over 200 years the land has
been held in parcels by Trinity Church and
other corporations, and that the man who
makes his claim good to-day will have to
root out some of the richest people and com-
panies in the world from property they have
held since the Revolution. Miss Stoddart,
wise woman, puts the misty claim in one
scale, and looks at the hundred millions that
would be thrown into the other scale, and
decides that nothing would ever be heard of
the claim of the Webbers if various agents
didn’t make a habit every 20 years or so of
whispering hope into the ears of the wide-
spread family, while holding out a hand for
a trifle to “prosecute preliminary inquiries.”
“Keep your trifle,” says Miss Stoddart; “if
the millions were yours, which they pro-
bably are not, it would cost a thousand
times more than you’ve got to ever reach
them. And then you’d be so long dead that
they wouldn’t help you at all.”
The Players’ Club will present a varied
programme at their final flutter for the year
—“Overruled,” a Bernard Shaw one-acter;
“Caliban,” 'to be produced by the author,
Francis Jackson; and a Grand Guignol
thriller, “E. and 0.E.,” to be produced b.v
Wynne Wliear Roberts. This assortment of
drama will be juggled at St. James’s Hall on
December 1 and 2, and,sweet music will be
dispensed by pianist Philippa Scheidel and
violinist Elaine Pennifold.
Nearly £l4O was raised by enthusiastic dis-
ciples of old music-master Josef Kretschmann
for the University Appeal. The pupils of
the G.O.M. and his pupils’ pupils who have
lately formed themselves into a club had the
unusual idea of placing their concert within
the Great Hall of the University itself. If
proved an incentive to music-lovers, and the
result was the cosy cheque which Ruby
Rich, the club’s president (she was, as a
small girl, a Kretschmann prodigy), handed
over to the Uni., impersonated by Professor
Holme, at the Club’s last cheerio.
Twelve years old and still going strong is
the record of the Clerical Women War
Workers. During the year their work has
included assistance to 15 soldier families;
the devoted little group still continues its
fortnightly visits to Pint 14, Prince of Wales
Hospital, and has managed three parties for
the sick soldiers during the year. In addi-
tion these young business women have made
53 warm bed-jackets and 20 pairs of bed-
socks for the use of the men in the T.B. huts.
Anybody wanting to send in a cheque, postal-
note. pound-note or penny stamp to help
the forthcoming Christmas party can address

The oil fire depicted above occurred
in Holland, and was extinguished in
1 \ minutes with Firefoam. It is
typical of many conflagrations which
more and more frequently bring home
the fact that all fires are not alike, and
that apparatus which affords excellent
protection for one risk may be quite
useless for another.
The Foamite Method of Fire Pro-
tection is of proved efficiency, even in
the case of outbreaks involving the
most inflammable spirits; also quickly
and effectively smothers out any
ordinary fire.

Melbourne being in its usual fit of social
depression after its Cup, this Chatterer,
after taking one distasteful look at a row of
unimportant engagements, made a sudden
resolution, threw a rug, a tent, a stretcher
and a vanity-bag into a car and rushed into
the country to see what Rural Sister was
doing. She really didn’t intend to do
the 1754 miles she eventually covered,
but the car (one of those new-model Chevs.
—but painted a wicked volcanic green—that
are beginning to infest the country worse
than Fords) kept going on and on, and the
country looked so cool and fresh after the
dusty city that the Chatterer and the Flapper
who sat at the wheel hadn’t any say in the
matter. Neither the Chatterer nor the Flap-
per knew what was going on underneath the
bonnet, but they didn’t need to know. The
thing just went on purring like Harry
Lauder’s kettle, and the only protest came
from the tyres. They had grounds, because
after they got into the Mallee they had to
revolve over some of the world’s worst roads.
But when anything went wrong with the
tyres the Flapper simply went and sat by
the side of the road and. commenced powder-
ing her nose, and in due course one of those
nice, tall, sun-browned out-back men would
happen along and put things right in his
laconic way, and look shy when the Flapper
thanked him. One of him spent 51 hours of
a broiling afternoon getting the car —it
answers to the name of Dobbin —out of the
bed of a lake into which the Flapper had
foolishly tucked it; and another, when the
Flapper looked puzzled over his directions,
insisted on turning his single-seater Fiat
back 12 miles, just to point out the next
turning.
But" 12 miles is nothing in the Mallee,
which is equally lavish in the matter of
tracks. St. Kilda-road boasts of its four
tracks, but some of the Mallee roads have
six, all tree-lined, too, and each one worse
than the other. It is bad enough to have
to go over them once in a lifetime, but
lots of people up there have to do it every
day and smile.
The second night out the expedition
pitched its tent on the banks of Father
Murray, at Nyah. What a solemn old mag-
nificence the Murray is—so large and digni-
fied and slow in its movements, like a Lord
Mayor at the finish of a civic banquet! It
will keep cropping up in this narrative over
and over again, just as it crops up in the
lives of thousands who live on it and by
it from its birth in the Alps to its demise
in Lake Alexandrina. One wonders how
many millions will be sustained by it in the
future. Engineer Knight, of the new weir at
Mildura, told us that it has fluid enough to
water 14 million acres, and only 300,000
acres are being nourished by it at present.
Everywhere men were toiling away stealing
its waters to fill lakes or putting them away
in dams for use in the dry season, as a thrifty
housewife puts away jams for the winter.
But the old stream doesn’t seem to take any
notice.
She is a lucky settler’s wife who lives on
the Murray or has one of its innumerable
irrigation-channels pouring its bluey-grey
waters past her doorstep. She can have
fresh vegetables and flowers on her table if
she likes, and lots of her do. The children
living in the irrigation areas looked happier,
better kept and more sprightly than those
engulfed in the grey-green ocean of the un-
irrigated Mallee. It is an extraordinary
experience to travel all day through that
drought-stricken ocean, where the only opti-
mists at present are the crows, and the red
soil doesn’t look as if it would grow a thistle,
and come out suddenly on a homestead like
that of the Peglers, at Mallee Cliffs, where
great flowering cedars stand in a trim garden,
and giant cauliflowers riot in the vegetable-
patch, and the lawns are as green and
smooth as Flemington’s, and the pumping-
plant can be heard taking its toll of the
inevitable Murray.
A picture of the same kind but on a big-
ger scale was the soldiers’ settlement at Red-
cliffs, 11 miles out of Mildura, where 500 ex-
Diggers have 15 acres apiece of vividly-green
orchard, as well as 200 motor-cars. There
is a good story told about those cars. The
soldiers are good fellows and hard workers,
but they love nothing better than a grouse,
and when a Minister for Lands blew up from
Melbourne to listen to their grievances they
arrived at the-local hall in force. Just before
the Minister was due a member of the
executive looked out and saw motor-cars in
phalanxes drawn up along the street. None
of your Chevrolet!* or Fords either, but
Ohryslers, Dodges and Hudsons. A council
of war was hastily called, and the motor-
owners were instructed to remove these
evidences of filthy prosperity to Redcliffs’
few secluded lanes. When the Minister
turned up only a couple of shearers’ Fords
flaunted themselves in the main street.
The settlers of Redcliffs look not to an
inscrutable skygod for their moisture, but to
the engineer of the pumping-station on the
banks of the übiquitous Murray. If you
want to flatter him you need to remark that
his plant looks like the engine-room of a
battleship, as indeed it does. Some of it, in
fact —a boiler-feed water-pump or something
equally mysterious-—did really belong to
H.M.A.S. Australia. Before she went to her
last port outside Sydney Heads it was
removed for further service ashore, and the
engineer, who also served for many years
in the dead warship’s engine-room, went with
it.
The man who has left the biggest mark
on Father Murray—on the Vic. side, at any
rate: —is the late J. S. Dethridge, of the
Rivers and Waters Commission. At Swan-
liill, at Nyah, at Mildura, wherever you see
the neat, wide-verandahed, tin-roofed bun-
galows set in orchards and vineries of quite
unspeakable green, where the channels of
Murray water flow crisscross in all direc-
tions, Dethridge’s water-meter is a con-
spicuous feature, and makes the landscape
look like a gigantic watch busily ticking off
the seconds. Nobody steals water in those
parts since the meters were installed.
The same brilliant brain was responsible
for the weir at Mildura. Engineer Knight,
who is building it, showed the expedition how
the huge thing is dropped into the river
when the water is low, to be lifted out as
easily as a dentist extracts a tooth and
dropped into its parking-place when it is no
longer needed. Irrigationists all over the
world are copying the Dethridge weir, but
this Chatterer would like to copy the garden
Mrs. Knight has carved out of the uninviting
soil of the river-bank just below her charm-
ing home.
Mildura looks to Melbourne, and Renmark
looks to Adelaide, and in between is No-
Man’s Land, burnt-up mallee, the dry por-
ringers of lakes, and no signs of human life
except a cryptic note scribbled in pencil on a
fence-post asking Ted Burke to tell Mrs.
Jones’s mother that the baby arrived all
right and was a boy. So the expedition
promptly got lost and remained lost until it
fell in with an Irish priest whose Ford had
a hacking cough and half a gallon of petrol in
the tank. The priest being lost, too, the two
cars continued to be lost in unison until a
friendly woolshed hove in sight and divulged
that the priest was 20 miles out of his course
and Dobbin a mere 10.
It is hard, if not impossible, to daunt the
woman of the Outback. The expedition,
having lost itself again, made for some smoke
until it came on a tent in the wilderness.
Out of the tent stepped a young woman with
a baby in her arms and two more hanging
to her skirts, and the heat was dreadful, but
not more dreadful than the flies. Husband was
away clearing the block. The district had
just had its drought, so next year should be
a good one —or the next —and a good year
meant a £2OOO crop. The tent was their
first home. A log house was building in the
offing. “Your car’s green, anyway,” said the
lady, with a humorous glance at her own
burnt-up surroundings. That, in most cases,
was the spirit in the Mallee.
This thoughtful face belongs to Cyril
Miller, who six years ago founded the re-
search farm at Brighton, where, on an
average, 6000 animals are kept for experi-
ment and ob-
servation. The
farm is the
third of its
kind in the
wor 1 d, the
United States
and Holland
possessing the
other two. Mr.
Miller’s pet

and Victorian
medals. He
married
Nancy Bleaz-
by, o n 1 y
p-a- d-daughtcr of Vic.’s one-time Premier,
the late Tommy Bent. The picture is by
Ruskin.
To continue the narrative interrupted by
the above portrait, it must be said that even
prosperity doesn’t bring leisure to woman,
either in the Mallee or the irrigated areas.
Hers is a 15-hour day all the year round.
The menfolk can knock off occasionally to
attend an indignation meeting, but when the
women aren’t mending clothes and cooking,
tliey are milking or picking grapes or
weeding.
Except in the soldier settlements, where a
paternal Government has assisted, the houses
are shocking. The cheap and easy and ugly
and unsuitable galvanised-iron is the only
wear, until you come to South Australia.
There the early settlers built for eternity—
quaint, solid farmhouses made of sandstone
cut out of the earth with a crosscut-saw; and
the new settlers have copied them.
It was pitiful to motor day after day
through a flat world whose only green spot
was Dobbin. Up to 100 miles from Adelaide
the expedition saw nothing but fields of
wheat that had grown up six inches and then
shrivelled. Forty miles from Kapunda a
German boy was carting water at three shil-
lings a thousand gallons. Then the first
unirrigated green field was passed, and the
scowl of the drought was seen no longer.
South Aus. is our Adelaide sister’s baili-
wick, but one couldn’t help remarking in pass-
ing that the young State had the prettiest,
best-kept landscape yet seen, and the loveliest
old-fashioned towns, and that the_ bitumen
track which winds through Adelaide’s far-
famed hills is one that Victoria might copy.
Also, S. Aus. looks after its motorists. It
looks after them so well that it won’t let them
run into each other at mqre than 20 miles
an hour. When the Flapper, who despises
anything under 45 m.p.li., reached the capital
she pulled up in her abrupt way and asked
a pedestrian what was the matter. “Nothing,”
said the pedestrian ; “why?” “Oh,” said the
Flapper, “I thought you were observing the
two minutes’ silence and had the date wrong.”
This is Mrs. George Bowcher. lion. sec. of
the Melbourne
and East Mel-
bourne Red
Cross Auxili-
ary of St. Vin-
cent’s Hospi-
tal. She also
wields a secre-
tarial quill for
the Grosvenor
Auxiliary,
named after
the home of
its president,
the Tallis
lady. Mr s.
Bowcher, who
is a Queens-
lander, hails
from the Dar-
ling Dow n s,
but with her
husband a
brother of
F rank Bow-
cher of war-loan fame —has been settled in
this city for some years. Spencer Shier made
the picture.
To get on with the story which another
portrait has punctuated, Dobbin found
her way home via the Prince’s Highway.
If Edward P. ever had the misfortune
to have to motor over that part of
it which winds about the Coorong lie
would send the British Fleet to have his
name removed from the signposts, The only
sport on the Coorong appears to be slaughter-
ing blue-tongued lizards. These creatures are
slow movers which have a perfect passion
for basking on Eddie Windsor’s highway,
though in business hours they do a lot of
good by going down snakes’ holes and de-
vouring the reptiles. Judging by the num-
ber of mouldering lizard corpses passed, the
game is to see how many of these harmless
and useful animals one can squash to the
gallon.
At Robe, which once basked in the fre-
quent glory of Governor Hindmarsh —his
country seat is now a boarding-house—the
expedition camped beside an eerie lake stated
by a small boy to be bottomless. At least,
a diver had gone down after a person who
was drowned but gave up after two miles
of it. But bottomless lakes appears to be a
South Aus. specialty. No town is considered
complete without one. One village which is
the unhappy possessor of a lake afflicted
with a bottom is thinking of having the
offence removed by contract. Mount Gam-
bier has no less than four bottomless lakes.
Certainly the Flapper, who went for a swim
in one and is a deep diver, hit her head
against something, but it may have been
one of the gigantic trout or bream that are
so frequently caught there.
The expedition camped its last night in
a private garden at Portland, which, as it
was made by one of the Ilenty brothers,
might have been the oldest garden in Victoria.
It certainly looked it. After that all was
plain sailing through the potato fields of
Warrnambool, the mellow pastures of Terang
and the boulevards of Colac in the throes of
market-day, with ifs main street by the
lake packed with cars and its flappers sitting-
in gaudy rows under the elms looking more
Parisian than the Parisians. It was easy
to forget that, 200 miles or so to the north,
was the nightmare of the Mallee.
Yet. in closing a somewhat rambling narra-
tive. one’s pleasant memory will be of how
the Mallee struggles to elevate its standards,
: even if the elevation mainly consists of
, outward show. This Chatterer is reminded
of a settler whom she saw setting out with
his new-washed family for the nearest town-
ship in a glistening Buick. The Flapper,
after a look inside the house, reported a
total absence of furniture above the grade
of petrol cases. “Scandalous!” she
unthinkingly; but “How like Toorak!” was
her more charitable afterthought.
Mention of Toorak brings us back to earth
and Melbourne. The chief event in that self-
centred metropolis last week was the Naval
and Military Club ball at St. Ivilda Town
Hall. There was the usual martial pomp of
scarlet and blue, though, owing to the Tas-
mania being the only sea-lion in port, the
blue was less in evidence. There was a cheer-
ful spirit of comradeship about the show.
President Monash’s figure—one paper re-
ported him to be wearing a uniform made-to-
measure in 1913 —inspired hopeless envy in
some younger and plumper men on whom
the fat years of peace have left their trace.
The Monash daughter, Mrs. Gerslion Ben-
nett, made one of the most impressive femi-
nine responses to the glitter of the males.
President Laura Nyulasy, of the St. Ivilda
branch, organised a matinee musicale at her
home, Graeme, Toorak, the other afternoon to
rake in some shekels for the St. Martin’s and
St. John’s Boys’ Homes. These institutions
depend on their committees for their income,
and each body guarantees £l5O a year. The
St. Ivilda home is now breathing freely, for
the effort more than covered the branch’s
liability. Smiling under a black crin hat
furnished with a shower of white georgette
roses, which cast a shadow over her white
gown, the president attended to the needs of
the hundred who responded to the appeal.
Chris Cowper and Margot Best sold flowers
and Madame Lambert. Judge Williams’s
daughter Ainslie, Alma Roberts and Biddy
Allen were singers.
When Jim Morell faced the Grammar
Chapel altar at twilight on a recent Tuesday,
a bride in the attire of 1830 took his
arm. It was his daughter, Jean Ada, whom
lie handed over to the care of Hugh Wallace
Smith, of St. Ivilda. under the direction of
Chaplain Arnold. The bride, a niece of
Melbourne’s mayor, floated in a mist of
tulle, through which gleamed a flounced
frock of ivory taffetas, and she carried a
sheaf of lilies. Small sister Peg trotted
behind in charge of the train. Two maids,
Billie Herman and Kathleen Wallace Smith,
were frockcd in buttercup-yellow crepe
ninon, powdered with amber and crystal.
The tulle cap, a compromise in headwear
for such occasions, was worn by several
guests. Mrs. Morell wore one garnished
with brilliants, and a smart black-and-
white toilette, and aunt Kirkpatrick’s had a
band of velvet leaves. The reception was at
No. 9.
Monty Grover parted with his second
daughter, Moira, to Bill Sayle at All Souls’,
Sandringham, the interior of which was gay
with pink and white blossoms. The bride
dimpled engagingly under a pink tulle veiling
which clouded silver lace and lame frock-
ings. An over-veil of age-yellowed Limerick
lace, floating in the rear, was proudly up-
b'dd by the bride’s four-year-old brother
Kevin. June Grover, Osier Sayle and
the latter’s small cousin Betty Handfield
’maided in pink and silver. The cake was
cut at No. 9.
Bridesmaid June Grover, though only 18,
is pledged to marry Alec Gurney, the young
black-and-white artist from Tasmania, who
lias had several drawings published by The
Bulletin lately.
When Emily Hannah, of Ballarat, reached
St. Pat.’a Cathedral one evening last week
she was met by Thomas Nicholas McKenna,
a boy from her home town, who temporarily
forsook his adopted Burmah to keep this
appointment. Yards of embroidered tulle
confined with a circlet of orange buds
flowed Over, the short gown set with narrow
frills of kilted georgette and lace, the bridal
train being under the guiding hands of
Mary and Bernadetta McKenna, in lace-
garnished frocks and pink hats. Niece Molly
Hannah came over from Launceston to
be principal ’maid.
Kathleen Donaldson, whose dad gave up
a Riverina squattage in favor of a Norfolk-
Island plantation, stepped off the Comorin
with her friend Peggy Fullarton, daughter of
the managing director of the Mcllwraith-
McEacharn line. They have been wandering
for the past year around Europe, giving
special attention to the shopping centres.
Friends eyed the roses of cabbage dimensions
propped under the returned ones’ cliin-lines,
and looked glum when Miss Fullarton an-
nounced that her trunk was crammed with
long-skirted frocks Dame Fashion has long
threatened to inflict on us.
Dr. Ann Macleod, who w'ent abroad for
further study, has won further honors in
diseases of women at Dublin. She is a gradu-
ate of Melbourne Uni. and before leaving was
resident medico at Queen Victoria Hospital.
Her student companion, Dr. Beryl Bowman,
returned the other day, and Dr. Macleod, who
is coming home to settle down to research
work, is booked for the end of this year. Her
dad. W. E. Macleod, is a resident of Moonee
Ponds.

Lady Goowin went to the R. G. Clarkes’
pretty home, Clovelly, Hamilton, for the fete
to help the missions to seamen. A bunch
of gerberas and Christmas-bush was handed
to her Ex., who wore navy mariette and
Chantilly, by wee Barbara Clarke. Mrs.
Clarke, in mulberry and grey satin, Mrs. P.
,T. Symes, in leaf green, and Mrs. G. K.
Jeffrey, in rose crepe de Chine, were the
hostesses. Misty meadow-sweet, tall gladioli
and roses dressed up the reception-rooms.
Posies were sold, and there were competi-
tions. The v.-r. table was decked with
meadow-sweet and pale pink-carnations bound
in mauve tulle. Bridge and mah jongg were
played, and amongst the fair maids who
helped were Jean- Gross, Tessa Reading and
Olga Barnes.
The Goodwins went to Ascot for Cup. day,
the Amerys being with them. The com-
mittee entertained them all at lunch and
afternoon tea. Lady Goodwin was in cafe
au lait mariette, with a rose-pink hat and
rose-pink scarf; Mrs. Amery chose Oriental
figured georgette with a broad nayy hat;
Airs. N. A. H. Campbell wore rose-blonde
georgette with hat of mushroom Bankok;
Airs, de AA’itt Batty was in cream and bois-
de-rosc; and Enid Bell wore figured rose-
pink.
The Women’s Club achieved a great suc-
cess with its mid-4 T ictorian evening. Freda
Bage, as ATctoria the Good, had a star
part, and on the shining round tables were
spread thick slices of bread and butter cov-
ered with “hundreds and thousands,” mince
pies, and other dainties our ancestors were
supposed to enjoy. There was no dearth of
antimacassars, and the bob and shingle and
feminine knees and ankles were carefully
concealed. Handsome Jean Moore looked
beautiful in early-Victorian attire. There
were several George Eliots; the polka was
danced ; candles provided illumination —and
one lady very properly fainted at the sight
of a mouse!
The Royal Queensland Golfites had a
dance at the club house in connection with
the mixed foursomes, the match of the
season. Gay flowers and colored lights
decorated, and there was a big roll up.
westralia.
Perth.
The Hospital Appeal has been responsible
for many social doings in the last few weeks.
The latest was a dance at the Indiana,
arranged by Afayoress Bryan, of Cottesloe,
Airs. C. F. J. North and Airs. D. C. J.
Hill. Two hundred of Perth’s smartest
motored out, and a goodly sum was added
to secretary Eagleton’s list.
Alayoress Franklin, who is president of the
Perth Croquet Club, opened the season at
the Esplanade on a recent afternoon. She
and the secretary, Airs. Shaw-AValker, re-
ceived bouquets, and tea was served in the
clubhouse.
The English croquet players, en route to
Alclbourne by the Oronsay, have been enter-
tained by local handlers of the mallet.
The Subiaco Croquet Club, whose season
was opened by the Mayoress of the borough
(Airs. Roydhouse), and the North Perth
Club, for whom Mrs. Alillington did the
honors, have had gala days; and the bowling
clubs are also socially active as a prelude
to strenuous devotion to kitty.
Airs. AAL H. Vincent is a keen musician
who has done
much to rais.>
the standard of
musical taste
in this city.
Her beautiful
home at Cot-
tesloe is a ren-
dezvous for
musicians, and
she founded
the Ladi e s’
Minn ewarra
Choir, which
meets at her
reside n c e
weekly for
practice. So
far the choir
has been heard
only at private
social gather-
ings, but a
concert - stage
appearance is
planned for an early date.
For many years Mrs. A. Randolph Nott,
one of our leading teachers of elocution, has
hidden her light under a bushel, but she gave
a recital last week. A mostly elderly audi-
ence received her with cheers, recalled her
again and again, and showered her with
posies and sweets. Needless to say her
programme contained all the old favorite
recitations.
NORTHERN TERRITORY.
Darwin.
Darwin is rapidly becoming a horseless
town. We even have a motor dust-cart.
AVe can also boast kerbstone petrol-pumps
and “silent cops.” Streets are being dug
up everywhere to lay underground telegraph
lines and cables, and housewives are con-
templating the near approach of the wet
season with anguished minds. Darwin mud
has the consistency of glue.
The stranding of the Ivoolinda caused some
difficulties here. Folk whose business called
them to AVyndliam, Broome or Perth found
the non-arrival of the boat a decided incon-
venience, especially when, as occurred in
several cases, people had let their houses,
sold their furniture and intended to spend
their last few 7 days here residing at a hotel
till the boat arrived. The completion of the
North-South line would obviate some of our
hardships, especially those relating to delayed
mails and interrupted boat journeys.
The Juvenile Tennis Club has held its final
meeting for the year. Parents and friends
assembled at the courts for a social after-
noon. Colonel Weddell, the Government
Resident, presented the trophies won during
the, season, the winners of championship
medals being Kitty Wright and Jim Watts.
Mrs. Bleezer, president of the club and one
of its best workers, listened to many com-
pliments.
The annual exodus is commencing, and
every outgoing boat is crow’ded with Terri-
tory folk who think that Christmas would
not be Christmas if it were not spent in the
southern States. February and March usually
see the tide flow in again.
The eleventh annual railway picnic has
been held at Adelaide River. There was a
good attendance, folks coming frqm Kath-
erine, Pine Creek and Darwin. Races for
Shanks’s pony and Dobbin kept the crowds
busy all day long.
The Katherine races were held a few days
later. Dividends ranged from 12s. to 455. on
the 10s. tote. Fields were smaller than had
been expected, a large number of entries
being scratched at the last moment.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
Our new 7 Commandant, Col. Cox-Taylor,
is making his marble good. The. presenta-
tion and consecration of the now colors of
the 40th Battalion, at Anglesea Barracks,
w y as most competently stage-managed—the
most impressive military ceremony Hobart
has seen for 40 years. A big crowd lined
every side of the Barrack-square, the official,
military and Parliamentary guests occupy-
ing positions on a dais. Bishop Hay con-
secrated the colors, and after the ceremony
both the old and the new flags were taken
to the Town Hall and handed over to the
Mayor. After the ceremony the Commandant
and Mrs. Cox-Taylor poured out tea for a
big party, including the O’Gradys.
This is Lucian Dechaineux, principal of
Hobart’s Technical College, which held its
annual exhibition in the new wdng re-
cently. A native of Belgium, he came with
his parents to
Australia as
a boy, and
studied art in
Sydney, under
Henri and
with Julian
Ashton, before
settling down
in Hobart and
specialising in
technical edu-
cation. II e
still paints,
and his home
is adorned by
many delight-
ful water-
colors from his
own brush. It
is the hope
of his friends
that he will
some day
treat the
public to a show of his work. At the Kodak
exhibition held at the Town Hall recently,
Mr. Dechaineux gave a lecture on “Photo-
graphy from the point of view of the artist.”
Some of the Tassie V.A.D.’s reviewed war-
time memories at the Boomerang Tearooms
recently. The rooms were decorated in
blue for the sake of the old uniform and in
scarlet for the Red Cross. All enjoyed the
evening immensely.
Yet another military shivoo was the gym-
khana held at the North Hobart Sports
Ground, when the O'Gradys were present
and a big crowd of military folk and their
friends.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Mrs. Lavington Bonython’s Peter Pan
party at the Town Hall was all that the most
exacting youngest could desire : a garden all
aglow and ablow with tulips, and to each
tulip a present attached. Mrs. Bonytlion
mustered a big committee to help her, among
them Mrs. A. C. MacDonald, who had the
commissariat under her wing, and Dora
Muecke and Mrs. Bickford, who ran the
tulip garden. Proceeds are for the Kinder-
garten Union.
The Lyceum Club has moved into its new
home—the top floor of Fada Building on
North-terrace, with a roof-garden thrown in.
President Mrs. John Corbin did the honors,
and she, with Mrs. Edgar Brown and Miss
Short as her lieutenants, was responsible for
the furnishing that has made the place so
delightful. The rooms are big, airy and rest-
ful. The strangers’ room is decorated in lac-
quer-red and blue against a background of
sober beige and black. The members’ room,
where pride of place goes to a Then Proctor
picture, is green with a hint of gold, with
soft blues and pinks in its chintzes. The
dining-room floor is of parquette with Per-
sian rugs, and the furniture is oak. It is a
big stride from the modest beginnings of a
few years ago, but there’s now’ a membership
of 200.
The Lewis-Glynn wedding (he the younger
son of the late John Lewis, of Prospect, and
she Mary, the MacMalion Glynns’ youngest
daughter) was at St. Lawrence’s Church,
with a party afterwards at the Glynn home
near by. The bride was in early-Victorian
attire of satin, tight-bodiced, long-sleeved and
long and full of skirt, and her bridesmaids,
Alady Gunson and Betty Anne Hill, were in
biege and delphinium-blue.
Helene Taylor’s friends assembled in hun-
dreds to greet her at the Town Hall. There
were speeches from Mayoress Bruce and re-
presentatives of the Glee Club and the com-
munity singers. Mrs. Wesley Latlilean, one
of the most indefatigable workers of the
auxiliary committee, said a word or two, and
then came the , singer’s charming thanks.
Adelaide Shearer’s concert, a couple of days
later, showed that she, too, has profited artis-
tically by her years in London.

N.L.D.: “A time of joy for you and I” —
oh shades of Lindley Murray, fie! H.E.W.: No,
not trash. Too much of it is prose. Try it again.
Robin B.: Excellent idea; but some of the
lines jar. The fourth, for example Grizel H.:
| Fell the second time round. . . .Booble: Gan find no
■ reason for printing “The Reason”.... Sonia H.:
i Nearly... .J.C.W.W.: Too long and incoherent
Cornforth: “Bury Me Carelessly” was tossed casually
into its grave.... H.P. (Goulburn) : Painful rehash.
f.A.K.: Your observations contain nothing new
jon a very old subject 0.K.K.: Tame exaggeration.
! Jetty Son: The very tripe and onions of
romance.... G. Desu (Toowoomba) : Remarkable for
a child of that age D.8.0’C.: The rhyme “knew
it”-“fruit” was its one delight.... Fan: Still
wondering what you mean in that last stanza....
L.W.: Overwrought 1.H.: “To His Harem” seemed
a promising title, but, alas! the word was “Haven.”
M.A.C.: “Wine” may do elsewhere. .. .S.L.P.:
A well-told incident, that’s all. .. . M.8.R.: We’ll let
you set the table: —
To Sydney’s leafy gunyah Dawn has hied.
“A sumptuous fare prepare. Since dusk I’ve tried
To come this way, but, oh, the slumbrous night
would stay
With you. Cow’s milk and new-laid eggs now bring,
And don’t forget the cigarettes, my dear,
For lots of pleasant cheer
From out your hair the withered wattle fling.”
loan B.: You chase an elusive idea into the
forests of verbosity.... Michael 0.: Awkwardly
worked. . . .Ron C.: We shed our meed of tears. .. ■
A. Mack: For these we have no possible use, no
probable, possible shadow of use, no possible use
whatever. .. .G.E.A.R.: We’ll leave it to the birds.
.... Cecil F. T.: It has only one recommendation —
i it’s short. .. .8.R.C.: It certainly was “an effort”—
to read Pat R.: We all have our troubles; but
the fact that those workmen have “no kindly hand to
guide” is truly pathetic... .G.H.R.: Re your appeal
to “give me your hands,” we would rather give you
pause... .3.11. (East Kew) : Fail... .G.0.A.: It got
a grip at length, and then lost it. . . .V.G.W.: “The
Settler’s Home” is tumble-down verse 5.0. M.:
Dull. . . .Pen: Just misses. . . .Rob K.: Poor stuff.
... .Malakuna: Nearly a column. Now try to get
the essential facts in 10 lines. .. .V.C.W.: Can’t
wallow the murder and the blood-stained wardrobe.
.. . .Just John : Nightmare verse. . . .Seagee: The
snake yarn is as enthralling as “snakes and ladders.”
. ...M.E.8.: Drowsy description of a snooze....
S.C.W.:. Why the reticence about names ? Thelma
M.: Poor..'. .T.W.N.: Not bad for your age
D. 8.0. : Well, that fails, anyway E. Del: Not
the sort of yarn we can fit in.... O’Driv: Uneasy
lies the political verse that rhymes “administer”
with “hon. minister” Rocket: It came down like
a stick. .. .F.R.F.: Unreal conversation.... Alex. A.:
Idea needs much better working. The “proportion”-
‘’contortion” couplet, for instance, makes a noise
like the clown falling in a circus M.S.: Didn’t
get a thrill from it. .. .Ross M.: Tame. .. .R.R.A.:
Your little tragedy :
| And many wasted hours went by
While you held me for your slave.
As I sat there silent and shy,
No word was spoken, no answer gave.
Till, one November morning,
I stood and watched you go
With never a word of warning
To whence I do not know.
But though my heart is broke,
My soul to thee doth call,
And I live by looking on
Your photo on the wall.
....Cam D.: “Were Art Thou’s Smiles” was can-
celled on the title Una F. A.: All too poor
Chas. F.: Far below standard... .Clave T.: Not quite.
.. . .Marion C. B.: Why “foaming poppies” ?. .. .
J.H.: The earnest boy is a bore. .. .Una C.: How
commonplace is that last stanza 1.... Edward C.: All
very inferior A.J.K.: “Jacaranda” lacks perfume.
. ...D.G.: You wake up again.... Angus Og: They
miss Caddy B.: Unless you can row better than
you write, it would be unsafe to go boating with
you. .. .Josephine L.: Impossible. .. .Oban : Dreary
narrative 11.A.W.: The verse gets no filthy lucre.
.. . .F.A.L.: The “figure” was such an obvious setting

THE INKY WA Y.
“Me Too” : To the weary ones who have
been making moan re their few-and-far-
between pars. I have been writing for the
leading magazines of the world for the last
10 years—but most of ’em don’t know it.
“Pulex”: From the Melbourne Herald’s
account of the ali-niglit debate in the House
of Reps, on the sale of the Commonwealth
steamers: —
Seven o’clock found the Chamber in an uproar,
with members shouting wwwdfiiknnEn, ol92forthes
ETAOINN personalities at each other.
Evidently Hughes began them in Cymric and
Brennan ended them in Celtic.
“Typotheatre”: Denis Bourke has spent
GO years with John Sands, the Sydney
printing firm (B. 17/11/’27). And now
Frederick llewitt, of the Melbourne Age
composing-room, is retiring at SO after
59 years there. Printer’s ink is mostly
lamp-black, yet it must contain lots of vita-
mines.
“H.E.C.” : Tiie Bulletin wasn’t always
as free from misprints as it is to-day.
Recently I spent some time over Vol. l,‘
No. 1 (Jan. 31, 1880) in the Mitchell Lib-
rary. On the very first page were no less
than eight errors. Incidentally, the same
leader referred to the S. M. Herald as ‘a
deliciously bizarre farrago of piety and
pruriency.”
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: It was the late
lamented Morning Post, of Melbourne,
which started the canard that the Age was
fluttering towards the Herald's hungry
maw, a rumor promptly and hotly denied by
the Symes. Now the paper responsible is
itself somewhere within the digestive organs
of the Herald.
“Knib” : A. C. Holtz, G.M. of the Argus,
is back from his eight months’ trip in time
to attend the conference of metropolitan
daily proprietaries and the A.J.A. on Nov.
28. This time he won’t be a sort of un-
official president as he has been at former
confabs, because there .will be an independ-
ent referee as chairman. Though he has
difficulty in suppressing a tendency to be
patronising, Holtz is a priceless asset of the
proprietors at such meetings.
“P.D.”: From the “Local and General”
column of a newspaper that lies before me: —
Sunday next will be observed as a day of thanks-
giving at St. George’s Church. There will be a
choral celebration at 7.30 a.in., a special children’s
service at 9.30 a.m. and festal evensong at 7.30 p.m.
The Vicar expects, to leave the following day.
“Sellheim”: A rare old specimen of the
North Queensland pioneer went out at the
age of 72, when James Chisholm, of the
Prairie, out Richmond way from Townsville,
scribbled his final sheet of copy recently.
Though widely known as a pastoralist of
original views—he was an ardent champion
of the Angora goat for small holders in the
N.-W. —his fame as “Along the Line,” a
writer of. interesting and amusing pastoral
and N.Q. gossip in the Northern Miner,
was even greater. No North Queensland
writer tvas more widely and appreciatively
read in out-back Queensland.
“Lao-dah” : Black-and-white artist Jimmy
Bancks sheathed his pen the other day and
went off to W.A. with Betty Ross Clark’s
company to take part in the six plays she. is
presenting to Perth. The restless artist
has finished "with the Sun Pictorial, and
the doings of Mr. Melbourne no longer claim
his daily attention. After his theatrical
interlude he contemplates getting six months
ahead of Ginger Meggs, so that he can go
across and have a look at Uncle Sam.
“Coot”: The editor of the Port Phillip
Magazine, which appeared in 1843 (B.
17/11/’27j, was Dr. Wilmot, and the price
half a crown. The periodical consisted of
48 pages, and the first copy contained several
ponderous essays, some original and bor-
rowed verse, a little fiction and an article
about the aborigines. Half-crowns for litera-.
ture, however, were evidently scarce, for
only three issues of the magazine were pub-
lished. Six years later, in 1849, the first
number of the Australia Felix Monthly
Magazine, under the editorship of Colin
Campbell, appeared. It wasn’t very happy,
and survived only four months.
“Oxmead”: The West Australian holds
a unique position in Perth by virtue of
having stalled off or worn down all morning
opposition. The last, the Herald, started in
1896, when Groperland was on the crest of
the gold boom, managed to struggle along
for a dozen years. It changed owners several
times during that period, finally falling into
ecclesiastical hands. At this stage it became
obvious that only heroic measures could
save the Herald from extermination, and
the clerical gentry in control hit on the
bright idea of eliminating all turf news.
That experiment effectively settled the paper,
and since then the West has had no rival
at the breakfast table.
“Lao-dah”: Col. Tom White, of Mel-
bourne, landed in an Air Force ’plane to
interrupt the telephonic conversations of the
Turkish army in Palestine, and was nabbed
before he could rise again. He ate Abdul’s
war bread for three years, and amongst his
fellow-prisoners were Jones and Hill, whose
“The Road to Endor,” the story of their
captivity, was the literary sensation of a
few years back and forestalled White’s own
memoirs. These latter had been used for a
paperweight for 10 years when an English
publisher passing through Melbourne found
them. They will parade in covers as “An
Airman’s Odyssey,” by Half Flight. There
is a touch of humor about that pen-name-
just as there was in an address which White
invented while he was a prisoner. He had
been one of the many Australians who
wrote to The Bulletin as regularly as he
could while the fighting was on, and when
he was captured lie couldn’t get out of the
habit. But, of course, writing to a news-
paper was not to be thought of —Abdul
would see to that—so White invented a
friend at 214 George-street, Sydney, called
“Mr. Ed. Biter.” Incidentally, one ot
Abdul’s rules for prisoners of war was that
their letters must not exceed six lines, but
he didn’t specify the width of the lines, and
one of White’s six-line notes to his friend
Ed. Diter filled a third of a column —the
sheet was over 2ft. from east to west.

What the Eye
Cannot See
The beauty of Dodge Brothers Senior Line is apparent at
a glance—but there is in these distinguished cars genuine
quality beneath the surface — quality which the eye
cannot see.
It is quality where quality counts in terms of long life,
smooth, economical operation, comfort and ease of
handling.
The springs, for example, are unusually long, like all
Dodge Brothers springs—each and every leaf of chrome
vanadium steel.
And the crankshaft, machined all over and weighing
sixty-nine pounds, is supported on seven bearings
generously oversize for the demands made upon them.
These are but two in a long list of engineering features
which contribute to day-in and day-out satisfaction in the
ownership of Dodge Brothers Six.

Dick Lawrence, thinking himself jilted
because Hazel Manning has vouchsafed no
reply to his written proposal, writes to
three other girls in succession on the same
subject. Not till the fourth has accepted
him does it transpire that the first three
have delayed doing so merely because they
didn’t receive their letters promptly, and
Dick, finding himself engaged to four girls
all about to descend upon his country home,
calls in Dick Ross and involves his friend
in the mesh of farcical trouble which makes
up “Oh, Richard! How Could You ?” pro-
duced at the Sydney Palace on Saturday.
The play drags in more improbabilities than
most farces, but the four women in search
of a husband, aided by an angry Frenchman
who loves one of them, a choleric but
amatory general of the most pronounced
stage type, and the massive wife of Dick
Ross, who keeps a special vocabulary of
words to describe her husband, make mat-
ters lively for the two Dicks until sanity is
restored and happiness established.
* * * $
Compton Coutts plays the part of Dick
Ross rather self-consciously, but with an
earnest determination to tickle the ribs of
the audience. As the helpful friend lie has
to allow himself to be described as the hus-
band of one of the pursuing ladies, whilst
the presence of the others is attributed to his
generally loose behavior. Gerald Kay
Souper makes a first-class effort to lift the
character of General Langford-Brooke away
from the stagey lines on which it is built;
Billy O’Hanlon, although his pretence of
illness when situations reach a crisis
wouldn’t have deceived the rawest army
doctor, is easy and natural as Dick Law-
rence ; and the explosive Frenchman is
given a very indifferent accent by William
Miller. Gertie Cremer has no chance to be
anything more than an attractive feminine
lead; Nellie Ferguson, as a wife who regards
her husband as a worm, and Zara Clinton,
as a lively Frenchwoman, have better oppor-
tunities, and utilise them with fair success.
Sybil Atholwood is an engaging Sylvia, niece
of the General; and Shirley Cook pu;ts
considerable ginger into the part of Euphra-
sia Dowcett.
A comparative weakness in male voices
was discernible in the Sydney Philhar-
monic Society’s performance of “Elijah”—
Town Hall on Wednesday of last week —
the last of the subscription events at which
conductor Joseph Bradley will be seen,
although he is to conduct the two “Messiah”
concerts on December 17 and 24. Raymond
Ellis, specially engaged to sing the baritone
part, which used to be bass before life and
voice standards became lighter, was fervent
enough when lie “wrestled with the Lord”
in the prayer for the widow’s son, but he
failed to find the full volume of magnificence
for “Is Not His Word Like a Fire?” and
the essential note of derision was lacking in
the taunting of the priests of Baal. In
the more tender moments the feeling of
Elijah for his people was rendered with
genuine pathos. Soprano Helena Stewart
did very well with music which reaches
some exacting altitudes, but her work lacked
evenness. The light voice of Nora Dixon was
clear and melodious in the few soprano
passages allotted to her. Ethel Dawe’s con-
tralto has an attractive quality, and her
enunciation is clear, but she lacked inspira-
tion ; even “O Rest in the Lord” missed the
full quality it should iiossess, although, as
always, it was the most approved item of
the evening. The choir reached some fine
periods of sonorous exaltation; the agitation
of the people at the dramatic episodes lead-
ing to the overthrow of the priests of Baal
was magnificently executed. The instrumen-
tal work was satisfactory, a particularly
noteworthy item being the ’cello obligato
accompanying Elijah’s “It Is Enough.”
Walter Kirby filled Sydney Conservatorium
comfortably for the first of his two recitals
last week, satin smoothness of tone and
artistic restraint being, as usual, the out-
standing features of his work. The improvi-
sation from “Andrea Chenier” was sung with
none of that feverish intensity which suggests
the young poet was starting the Revolution
by shattering the chandeliers in his friends’
drawing-rooms. Mr. Kirby’s diction is as
faultless as his French and Italian; and a
group of English ballads was charmingly
rendered. Tlie spiritual significance of
Richard Hageman’s “Christ Went Up Into
the Hills” was conveyed in crystal-clear,
poignantly-sad tones. Even “Ben Bolt” be-
came something to live in the memory as
sung by Kirby in what he states is his
farewell before going to London to make
still more records for His Master’s Voice.
Dorothy Mould, a picturesque girl with a
soft, warm and round voice, was assisting
artist, and Lettie Keyes’s wizard fingers
wove the accompaniments.
“Nobody’s Widow,” Avery Hopwood's
comedy, kept St. James’s Hall, Sydney, rock-
ing with laughter for four nights last week.
Its bright interpreters were the Vagabonds,
and they worked each night for a different
worthy cause. Val Cohen acted the divorcee
■who pretends she’s a widow (Roxana) and
runs into a still doting husband, Eric Cop-
pard, at an English house party. His
attempts to make the mischievous Roxana re-
marry him pack three acts with absurd
situations, and the thistledown comedy blows
lightly to anchorage in a lady’s boudoir at
three in the morning. Val Cohen was as pro-
vocative and attractive as heart could wish,
and brought the curtain down on the second
act with a gesture as incisive as her final
“damn !” Clive Coppard, as the lady-killing
Duke, was too much the cherubic clioir-boy
to be convincing, though his diction is very
good and he has a more subtle range of inflec-
tions than the other males.
There has been a “rearrangement of the.
line,” as the military phrase goes, on the
Sydney theatrical front. The gap in the
Palace Theatre sector having been filled,
the Margaret Lawrence season at the Cri-
terion is to finish a week earlier than in-
tended, and Anita Loo’s “The Whole Town’s
Talking,” with Marie Burke as the lead, is
to make its appearance on Saturday. The
new company, which is to play “The Cuckoo
in the Nest,” formerly timed to open at
the Criterion on December 3, is apparently
in reserve for use as a storm troop wherever
it may be needed. “Castles in the Air” is in
its last weeks, “Wildflower” being due for
a short revival at Her Majesty’s on Decem-
ber 17. The Theatre Royal sector is still
firmly held by Moscovitch and “The Terror.”
“What Happened to Jones” will be re-told
at the Grand Opera House on Saturday,
where “The Gorilla” finishes to-morrow
night. That gay story of pink pyjamas con-
tinues to be revealed in “Archie” at tin
St. James.
:|s *
“Tweekie” changed into a new edition at
Sydney Empire last week; the furniture-
remains much the same, but some clean, new
curtains of song have been added, and car-
pets have been beaten to shake out jokes
that have been dusty. The greatest altera-
tion is the arrival of Gwen Matthews, a
bright Australian girl from the chorus, who
fits admirably into the part of Mary Thomp-
son, which was formerly Adeline Poe’s.
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Owen McGiveney, the protean actor, dash-
ing out as Fagin, the Jew, meets him-
self coming back as Bill Sikes.
Monday next is marked down for the
Williamson matin&e in aid of the Greycliffe
Disaster Fund. There is booking for all
parts of the house —Her Majesty’s, Sydney—
for an event which is assured of warmest
public support. Artists from all the theatres
are lending a hand in a mixed programme.
Solemn warning is given that the days of
Hetty King at Sydney Tivoli are numbered;
the Di Gatanos with their whirling dances are
also on the vanishing list. That entertaining
old man Rich (who is really only 27) and
his partner are back again on a bill which
maintains a high quality; and new arrivals
are Cook and Vernon, comedy merchants
with a strong American accent. The com-
petition of the summer sun has caused the
management to bring matinee prices down to
“popular” rates.
Jim Gerald’s latest frivolity is “Nights
of Joy,” with an Eastern Finale which brings
a good finish to Gerald’s romping humor at
Fullers’, Sydney. Phyllis Du Barry makes
a specialty of “The Dance of the Swans,”
which is one of the new programme’s best
attractions. Additions to the vaudeville side
are a comedy pair, George Storey and Dulcie
Miller, who are moderately entertaining.
❖ * * *
In a century or so Theodore Roosevelt
wilt probably be a traditional American hero ;
“The Rough Riders,” screened at the Sydney
Lyceum, siiows him as a courageous man of
action whose sterner qualities are seasoned
with bluff heartiness and kindly humanity.
It is a well-produced film in which armies
are handled with fine stage generalship. In
“Foreign Devils” at Hoyt’s, something that
looks like the real China of the time of the
Boxer rising is made the background for
the exploits of the hero of a Peter B.
Kyne story. An exceeding pleasant romance
staged in Hungary, “The Stolen Bride,” is
its partner on the Hoyt’s bill. “False
Shame” pursues its way at the Adyar Hall;
“The Flag Lieutenant” keeps the Prince
Edward full; and the Crystal Palace finds
“Seventh Heaven” all it needs at present.
“TWEEKIE,” AT
SYDNEY
EMPIRE.
Loring Smith as the drummer with a trick
cigar; and Sam Stern, the singing
waiter.
The Christmas Art Market opens :
R. 11. Jcrrold-Natban is an artist who knows more
about clothes than bodies ; his show at Sydney Fine
Art Gallery, King-street, is chiefly notable for some
lively and faithful portraits, one of J. A. Mur-
doch, M.L.C., being especially good; and the
likeness of C. Ct. Macartney, padded for play,
conveys to canvas the batsman’s conviction that rhe
bowling will be easy to knock. There are some deli-
cate floral studies; but in several pictures where
the nude figure is attempted the result is lament-
able. The artist is not often successful in land- .
scape, either, but there is a very pleasing “Interior”
looking out from the cool shadow's of a house on to
a sunlit garden.
The Society of Women Painters is holding a cash-
and-carry show at the Queen Victoria Building
rooms; you pay for your picture and take away
your purchase at once if you like. The show would
be improved if half of the pictures were taken
aw'ay instantly; yet there are a few very
acceptable items. The outstanding exhibit is
a vivid bowl of roses painted by Ethel
Stephens, who has some other nice offerings. A
study of Henry Lawson’s old home, by Gloria Sims,
has a genuine interest apart from the commendable
painting; and A. Parsons and Elsie Middleton with
kindred subjects—“ Waning Day” and “Waning
Light”—score well. Mrs, N, P. Clinton supplies a
“Boatshed, Goat Island,” which gives the eye a sense
of coolness and rest; another of hers is the season-
able study of a turkey-gobbler, justly indignant at
having his portrait painted. A very appealing bowl
of nasturtiums is amongst the work of Margaret
Coulter; there are some delectable child fancies by
Violet Bowring; and Laura Booth, M. A. Parsons,
M. Barling and Alice Whyte are others whose
work strikes the eye.
Sk 3k 4-
Half-way through, several persons left
“Outward Bound” noisily on Saturday night
at Melbourne Royal, possibly as a protest
against the slow initial tempo of the piece.
Unless a play has two murders and a suicide
within five minutes of the rise of the first
curtain, the modern audience begins to long
for a cigarette. “Outward Bound” depends
for its effect on the gradual thickening of
atmosphere—and how cleverly and consis-
tently that thickening is done! The Mel-
bourne revival brought Charon’s ferry back
with a mainly-new passenger list of damned
souls. Ronald Ward took Mr. Prior. He
made that egregious youth more humorous
when drunk, but less dramatically convincing
when sober, than Campbell Copelin did. A
faint hint of farce clung to the skirts of the
Cockney charlady of Emma Temple, and
interfered with the appeal which Henrietta
Cavendish found in her in the original pro-
duction. Ellis Irving faded in and out as
Henry the Halfway in a satisfactorily vague
manner, and Reg Wykelmcn was the out-
rageous Mr. Lingley. Marie llatton was
not altogether a satisfactory substitute tor
Mildred Cottell as Mrs. Clivedexi-Banks, the
only low-comedy person in the play. 1. ®t.
II Jellicoe personified the earthly sanctity
of the Rev. Duke, and the gorgeously satiric
Eardley Turner portrayed the heavenly ditto
of the Rev. Thompson. Zillali Bateman
repeated her careful study of Ann—Miss
Bateman handles her lines as it they were
so many pieces of precious Ming -and B. A-
Be win was back in his old place behind the
ghost-ship's bar.
Those who like their farce served hot and
steaming, by swift if not noiseless waiters,
need go no further than the Palace, Bourke-
street, Melbourne, where F. Neil is disgorg-
ing “Not To-night, Dearie,’ nightly and at
the usual matinees. The Neil public is the
kind that roars at the mention of trousers,
bellows at a reference to stockings and goes
into convulsions at a bare allusion to a nightie.
As all these articles of apparel receive
frequent notice in “Not To-night, Dearie,’
the response of Saturday afternoon’s audi-
ence was all that could be wished. As
proprietor of the Paul Revere Inn, which
gets its customers by the simple method of
digging a hole in the road for night-speeding
motorists to fall into, Field Fisher assaulted
his part with vigor, and got all the laughs
that were not laid at the quaint feet of Lily
Molloy as Pansy Dolittle, the marvellous
lady slavey. Beryl Barraclough, Rosa Dug-
gan, Mary Gannon and Connie Martyn also
appeared, Paul Longuet strolled on and Jef-
ferson Taite burst in. Frank Neil uttered
the lines of a young lover in the blase
manner of a seasoned actor at his umteenth
rehearsal. An innovation is the giving over
of the intervals to the Statler sisters, two
metallic ladies in bare legs and the Ameri-
can language, and to a famous .Danish singer
with the famous name of Enrico Pelmetto.
On Saturday the Melbourne Opera Co.
presented “Dorothy” at the Princess, the
same showhouse where Melbourne saw Nellie
Stewart, Flo Young, etc., ride to the same
musical hunt 39 years agone. Amatteur
singing is frequently good, but most amateur
acting is a dreadful bore. “Dorothy” was,
however, moderately well done in the first
act. After that she wilted. Alma Pike’s
soprano was finely displayed in the leading
role and John D. Sullivan sweetly squired
her with his capacious tenor. Sybil Sliaw
was a plump and vivacious Phyllis Tuppitt
and Les Lake was the allegedly side-splitting
Lurcher. The hop-pickers, guests and brides-
maids stood about and sang, and the peasants
and huntsmen sang and stood about; but
the chorus of old women sang and also
acted.
At Melbourne Tivoli Owen McGiveney is
still changing his characters with a rapidity
that astounds even the politicians in the audi-
ence. Two gymnasts in tigerskin underwear
are relegated to the last, but their amazing
indifference in the face of death would earn
them V.C.’s on the field of war. Armstrong
and Phelps, two typical boys from Holly-
wood, are chief contributors to the wear and
tear on the Tivoli piano. “Where Do
Mommers Learn the Things They Tell Their
Daughters Not To Do?” is one of their philo-
sophic numbers. “What Good Is Alimony
to a Woman in Bed on a Cold Night?” is
yet another.
At Melbourne Athenaeum after Saturday
the low-comedy police force will retire into
private life and the ghost of a theatrical
producer will go wherever stage ghosts go.
Or perhaps it will be re-engaged to drive
“The Ghost Train,” which will commence to
run again on Monday. In these days of
incessant mystery plays imitation spooks
are in almost as much demand as they w r ere
in Sliakspeare’s time.
* * * *
“Our Wife,” who used to be Sardou’s
“Divorcons” until she was translated, will
introduce Margaret Lawrence, a comedienne
new to Melbourne, at the Royal on Saturday.
The King’s will struggle to accommodate
the people who want to seee “Caroline” for
yet another weiik; after which “The Letter,”
stamped by Boucicault and addressed to
lovers of the more serious drama, will be
opened.
Repat. isn’t exactly famous for putting
soldiers or soldiers’ sons into the jobs for
which they are most fitted, but in the case
of Victor Stephenson it made no mistake.
The shy young Queenslander, son of a soldier
killed in the war. was sent to Melbourne
University to study music under the Chil-
dren’s Education scheme. He reported pro-
gress on the Assembly Hall piano one night
last week. The report included Bach’s diffi-
cult Fantasia and Fugue, three representa-
tive items from Brahms, a Chopin panel and
the very long and very exacting and very
rambling Schumann concerto in A minor.
The impression given was that the country
will not be called upon to write off any loss

on Victor Stephenson’s account. In fact,
if he remains as thoughtful, as sensitive to
fine effects and as technically conscientious
as he was in the abovementioned pieces, the
country may some day show a substantial
profit from him.
In the mute-drama section, Melbourne
audiences are surveying the battle of Mons
at the Playhouse and “The Term,” which
ends a well-populated run to-morrow, at the
Auditorium. It is only in the pictures that
a star can make her debut in two places
simultaneously. In “Seventh Heaven,” at
the Capitol, and “Two Girls Wanted,” at the
Majestic, Janet Gaynor is performing this
interesting feat. At the latter theatre “The
Price of Honor” can also be seen, a stirring
melodrama, sinisterly furnished with Uncle
Sam’s electric chair. Mr. Hoyt’s patrons
are fully occupied with that engaging feline,
Felix, a'school comedy called “The Poor
Nut,” and a domestic washing-up of
dramatic dishes, entitled “Jealousy.”
v *!' *!* V
The Melbourne Cup (art section) :
This classic event, sometimes known as the Three
A’s, was run over the Athenxum course on Saturday,
Theodore Fink officiating- as starter. Thirty-two
entrants from three States were sent off under three
divisions. As soon as the machine lifted for the
portrait division, John Longstaff’s “Grace Pullare”
leapt to the front, but beautiful as she looked she
had no staying power and was soon overhauled by
“H. C. A. Harrison, Esq.,” a strong, nervy nomina-
tion from the same stable. At this point H. B.
Harrison's handsome and high-spirited “Mrs. Hey-
wood” claimed attention, followed closely by Charles
tVheeler’s quiet but clever little Japanese Ally
“Madame Kawamura.” Moving briskly from the outside
position Leslie Wilkie’s “Little Miss,” from Adelaide,
took up the running, only to be bumped by two
entrants from the well-known J. S. MacDonald stud.
As the field entered the straight it was seen that
two youngsters belonging to W. B. Mclnnes were
in the van, “The Age of Real Sport” leading from
“Master Nicholas Talbot Hamilton.” L. Bernard
Hall’s “The Quest” was hopelessly outclassed, being
hampered by her clothing; and veteran trainer
Blamire Young’s quartet, “John Shaw Neilson,” “Dr.
Harper Bell,” “Charles Darwin” and “Nadia,” looked
distinctly tired. A dingdong go developed between
Norman Carter’s “Alfred O’Shea” and his neighbor
“Will Dyson” (which, however, was carrying too
much weight) ; but it was forgotten by the crowd
when “Study under Artificial Light” was seen to be
coming up rapidly on the outside. The way this
small and inconspicuous bay (from Harley Griffiths
out of Max Meldrum) worked to the front and stayed
there was an eye-opener to the backers of more popu-
lar and showy mounts. After the excitement of the
portrait contest, the landscape division was tame
in the extreme. Murray Griffin’s “Burke Bridge,”
Harold Herbert’s “Little Dock” and Knox’s “Yankee
Barque” were up to form; but John D. Moore’s
“South Wind” was obviously sick and should never
have been started. Victor Zelman’s “Promise of
Spring” easily romped home first. By the time the
barriers had gone up for the still-lifes half the
spectators had gone home. Miss A. M. E. Bale’s
“Ranunculi” only had Miss Margaret Preston’s “Gum
Blossom” and “Native Heath” to compete against.
The books never took a bet.
Another Melbourne show
The composition of Thomas Friedensen, as revealed
by his paintings and etchings at the Fine Art
Gallery, is better than his atmosphere, which is not
Australian ; nor is his foliage eucalyptic. Like Van
Raalte, he is a romantic, and views the local scene
through European spectacles. But he is an extremely
clever wielder of the etcher’s tool and the pencil.
*
Adelaide’s theatrical menu for the past
week has been reduced to revue and pictures.
“Every Mother’s Son,” at the Theatre Royal,
is a very human story written round the war.
Robert Roberts and his Bon Bon Revue Co.
are still providing song and dance at the
Majestic. West’s Pictures are screening
“Blonde or Brunette,” and throwing in a
vaudeville act with the Ivwong Sing Wall
troupe of Chinese contortionists. “Rookies,”
at the Wondergraph, is another khaki picture,
but deals with a training-camp, which affords
more scope for comedy. The York shows
“Cheating Cheaters,” Muriel Starr’s last pro-
duction, and the film is an improvement on
the play; “The Prince of Head Waiters,” a
N’Yark product, fills in the chinks. At the
Grand one may see in “Sacrifice” a love
story, with “Cupid’s Knockout” for the sup-
porting film. Tat Hanna’s Diggers opened
what should be a good season on Saturday.
“C. Ma” : Undaunted by the loss of their
previous venture —it vanished in smoke last
year—the Phillips Bros, have been busy
running up another modest little film house
on St. Ivilda sands. “Seventh Heaven”
liousewarmed the new structure, and for the
opetiing ceremony approximately 3000 people
surged up the marble staircases. There was
a comfortable seat for everybody, and the
ozone provided by the special ventilating
plant was sufficient for all the assembled
lungs. The owners claim their theatre to be
the largest in Australia. It cost £150,000,
anyway.
Poverty
Point
“Hamfat”: Now that Eily Malyon has
gone, the Williamson firm is glad to have a
lady like Jessie Page about. Jessie’s make-
up as the elderly female missionary in the
Sydney production of “Rain” is as excel-
lent as her adherence to the character.
She was the Chinese female horror, Wei-wa-
slii, in Oscar Asche’s “Cairo”; yet the lady
can make up charmingly when allowed to be
herself. Pretty women are plentiful, but
actresses who can represent ugly women
are rare.
“C. 8.” : One of the humors of the recent
Alda outburst was the reaction of a Mel-
bourne daily. To reassure its readers that
Australians weren’t as abominable as the
disappointed prima donna asserted it rushed
round and asked the opinions of Beppie de
Vries and Irene Vanbrugh. Irene has just
started on an Australian season and Beppie
is in the middle of one. Well, you know
what they said !
“HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL.”
“Ever owned a car, brother?”
“No, laddie, not yet. I’ve never had a
decent engagement since they were in-
vented.”
“Santander”: Dion Boucicault may pro-
duce Molnar’s “The Play’s the Thing”
before the season closes at Melbourne King's.
With the possible exception of a crime-drama
originally staged at Buda-Pestli, “The Play's
the Thing” is more theatrically presentable
than any other of Molnar’s efforts. The
English rendering is the work of P. G.
Wodehouse.
“Arradni”: The revival of “The Ghost
Train” in Melbourne will serve to re-intro-
duce Madge Mclntosh, who was popular in
Australia 20 years ago. Supported by Har-
court Beatty, she played in the Walter Mel-
ville pieces, “Her Love Against the World ’
and “The Midnight Wedding.” Under the
management of Meynell and Gunn, later,
“Fedora,” “Jim the Penman” and “Paul
Navafre” were staged. Madge appeared here
also in Maeterlinck’s “Blue Bird.”
“8.C.”: Frances Alda’s denunciation of
most things Australian is not unusual in a
disappointed artist. A French dancer abused
New York even more bit-
terly on one occsion. The
lady’s turn proved too tor-
rid even for Manhattan and
she changed managements,
becoming the star item at a
night club which prohibition
agents raided. A policeman’s
overcoat was thrown around
her before she was bundled
out to tbe patrol waggon.
The police story in court
next morning secured a de-
portation order, and the lady
was escorted to her ship.
Her last impressions of
America were shouted from
the rail as the steamer drew
out. At the end of the
tirade she screamed across
20yds. of water: “Tell zem
—tell zem ze boose ’ees-rot-
ten, too !”
“L.H.” : McArthur’s ware-
house in King-street, now
being pulled down, was once
Sydney’s Opera House. It
was opened by Kelly and
Leon’s Opera Co., in “The
Doctor of Alcantara” on
Dec. 26, 1879; Kelly’s son,
Edwin Lester, who appeared
in that show, is still on the
stage. A revival of “Pina-
fore,” previously done by the
co. at the School of Arts,
was stopped by a J.C.W.
injunction. Early in IBSI
scene-painter W. J. Wilson
became lessee, and later on
was joined by Signor Majer-
oni. Their reign lasted till
1887. Majeroni and his wife
appeared in “Mary Stuart”
and other plays, and the
Majeroni-Wilson Opera Co.
played Luscombe Searelle’s
made -in - Australia operas
“Bobadil” and “Isadora.” In

World in Eighty Days,” the

“I used to stay at such a thrilling old castle in England.
Ancestral home and dll that, you know. Ghost

“Wouldn’t do me. I want mine regularly every Friday.”
building was transformed into a warehouse.
“Bullet-out” : Charlie Vaude, of Vaude and
Verne, listened patiently While the deadhead
slated the show from overture to curtain.
When he paused for breath Vaude asked him
what he was going to do about it. “What do
you mean?” queried the deadhead. “Well,”
said Vaude, “if I were you I’d go and demand
my pass back.”
“Flaming Youth”: Daughters of two old
Australian stage identities get an oppor-
tunity together in “Oh, Richard ! How Could
You?” at Sydney Palace —Sybil, daughter
of J. B. Atholwood, and Gertie, daughter of
Brandon Cremer. Gertie commenced her
stage career when she was an infant —in
the days of her father’s touring companies.
“Wood’s Green” (Bond.) : Dion Tither-
adge has pleased both critics and public with
his play, “The Crooked Billet,” at the
Royalty. The action is thrill on thrill,
rising naturally from the situation, and
the characters are human. St. John Ervine
testifies that “the detail is exceedingly well
done; the pieces of the puzzle dovetail ;
there are no loose ends or slovenly patches.”
He confesses, however, that one of the situ-
ations was nearly too much for him —that
of a realistic attempt to cut a man’s throat.
But a cinema-fed population may yet howl
for real blood.
“Santander”: “Our Wife,” which Louis
Bennison and Margaret Lawrence are cart-
ing to Melbourne in place of “The Road to
Rome,” is not the first mash of Sardou’s old
“Divorcons” that has been decorated with
fresh green stuff and put on the public’s
plate. Thirty years ago someone minced
the same theme for Violet Vanbrugh under
the title of “The Queen’s Proctor,” and it
seemed to lack both pepper and salt. Violet
Vanbrugh, by the way, is disconcerting those
who declare that a leading woman is too
old at 50 by reviving herself as Claire For-
ster in “A Woman in the Case,” a part she
first played at the London Garrick in 1909.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : If ever misfortune
haunted any woman it was sunny-haired,
gentle-voiced Grace Warner. Grace lost
husband (Franklin Macleay) and child early
in her married life. Then came her father’s
death in tragic circumstances. Engagements
fell off, and she left the stage to conduct
a boarding-house in Southend. There she
fell ill and died in an infirmary-—in ignor-
ance of the fact that £20,000 had been be-
queathed to her by a chance acquaintance.
When the lawyers made inquiries amongst
theatrical folk they met few who could tell
them whether she was alive or dead, let
the Warners were once famous the world
over.
“Cauboy”: There is no bigger gamble in
the world than the acoustics of large halls.
In the rebuilding of Melbourne’s civic centre
extraordinary care was lavished on this.
The walls were panelled with a ptateiu
material said to amplify sound, and artist
Napier Waller was not allowed to use coloi
in his frescoes for fear it might interfere
with this alleged quality. Yet at a Gaud
Mayoral banquet recently scores of listeners
hardly caught a word of the speeches
although radio amplifiers were employed.
One reason given was that the tables got
in the way of the sound waves. If the
furniture upsets the sound waves like that,
the chairs may have to be abolished and
concert-goers encouraged to sit on the floor.
“Count Drolatique”: Charles Tait, the
oldest of the brethren, was looking casually
at the grandstand at Flemington when he
caught the comment “That’s one of the
Taits counting the house, as usual.” A
mean reference to a practice, presumed by
their enemies to be exclusive to the family,
which probably became a habit in their
early days. When the takings amounted to
a fiver and the front-of-the-house expenses
topped £4 10s., as I have seen in a battered
notebook now treasured, the brothers could
be pardoned for checking the heads twice
in the hope that the first estimate was five
bob too small.
“L.H.P.”: Harry Paulton, an actor who
contrived to make small parts look big, has
taken his last curtain. He was seen here
with Max Figman, Louis Bennison and
others. Then he gave up the stage and
settled down as a storekeeper at Liverpool
(’N.S.W.). He wall be recalled for his per-
formance of Peter in “A Tailor-made Man”
at Sydney Criterion in 1919.
“Css”: In a Victorian hamlet the other
day I was attracted by a handbill advertising
our old friend “East Lynne.” In sheer bore-
dom I decided to see the old show, but
changed my mind when I read on the hand-
bill, “Mothers ! Bring your children to see
Little Willie taken to the angels.” followed
by, “Wanted, girls between 10 and 14 to act
as angels.”
“Glen A.”: Melbourne’s first panto, was
produced at the old Queen’s Theatre on May
13, 1850, by way of a benefit to Charles
Young. The piece was written by Young
expressly for the occasion; it was entitled
“The Goblin of the Gold Coast, or Harlc-
ouinna and the Melbournites in California.”
It had no great literary merit, but it drew
a crowded house.
JUSTICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“An interesting volume in the Melbourne Public
Library is ‘Histrio-Mastix,’ an attack on stage plays
by William Prynne. The attack so offended Charles
f. that Prynne lost his ears, was fined £5OOO, and
spent eight years in gaol.” —Melbourne Heuai.d.
Why do you sit, O ancient mime,
All smiling and aloof?
And do you dream of a braver time
When stalls, no longer proof
Against your rare, compelling art,
Just guerdon will bestow?
Why do you sit serene, apart
From all the bustling show?
Ah, pass and let me be, laddie !
I read of a better world ;
Upon this page I see, laddie,
A vision fair unfurled,
And I would, with my thoughts away,
Forget this dull, degenerate day.
What does it say, O ancient mime,
The volume that you hold?
And does it tell of a far-off clime
Where wait both fame and gold ;
Some theatre greater, grander far,
Than any you have known ;
Some distant and distinguished star
That shines for you alone?
Ah. pass and say no more, laddie!
No future’s here forecast;
I read of days of yore, laddie,
A sane, discerning past
That knew its asses, it appears—
And duly cropped a critic’s ears!

Whiskeq History
in the making
One must &o back nearly 150 years to
arrive at the begjnnin&s of John Jame-
son Dublin Whiskey. Some time prior
to 1780, the first John Jameson sailed
from fiis native Scotland £or Ireland,
and in those days travel was a hazard-
ous enterprise. But to John Jameson,
braving the journey across the Irish
Sea, proved a most fruitful venture. By
1780, not only had he acquired an
interest in the Distillery at Bow Street, Dub-
lin, but had established in it his two sons, John
and William. By 1800 the former controlled
tlje Distillery, and for three generations a John
Jameson has succeeded to the chairmanship of
the Company.
This close personal association of thp Founder’s
family with the actual production of John
Jameson Whiskey is largely responsible for its
maintenance of the very highest quality stan-
dards over a period of nearly 150 years. It
was excellent in the days of George 111. It is
excellent to-day.

The Last of His Race.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALONE red bull with long horns tossing,
Thick-set neck and flanks a-glisten,
Paused awhile at the stony crossing,
Paused a distant sound to listen.
A warden proud of his hill-bred order,
Long had he kept his watch and guard,
This last wild bull along the border
Now hardly pressed and dying hard.
Never had rude brand, hotly searing,
Singed a hair of his glossy hide,
Lord of a land where, greatly daring,
Only the best of stockmen ride.
Bold as the best are they and bolder,
Horsemen lean of a quiet kind,
Roughly bred, but their hearts of gold are
Soft as the hearts of wonvenkind.
Scattered, alone, at times in cluster
Of racing hoofs, had they tried tp yard
This great red bull at their yearly muster —
Cornered at last and dying hard!
Ever had he in his wild way pitted
Craft and courage against their will,
Leaving his human foes outwitted,
Leaving him free to Nature still.
His were the ranges blue that double
Round with a turning coast again ;
His were those mountain springs that bubble
Out on the narrow Nadgee plain;
His were steep gullies deeply driven
Into the hills when dead stars shone
High in a strange fire-littqn heaven
And near moons glowed in nights agone.
His were the knotted thickets trodden
By the timid things of the bush;
His were the marshes, weird and sodden,
Margined by pasture green and lush.
Haunts of bitterns and shy cranes only;
Saving their harsh cries now and then,
They slept in a sombre stillness lonely,
Far from the speech and steps of men.
Now, in the rutting season, led by
Love of a heifer young and sleek
Whose lowing soft from the swamp she
fed by
Lured him over the fatal creek,
His fate was writ; his instinct told him,
Pawing the ground in hopeless wrath,
Those biped things would surely hold him
Poised like hawks on his mountain path.
Challenge he roared : “I die upstanding!
Rebel I stood, rebel I fall!
Hell to butchers! Hell to the branding!
Hell and Hell, red Hell to you all!”
They heard and knew! Carefully laying
Sights of his rifle sure and true,
Breath indrawing, but naught delaying,
Clarke of Timbillica drew.
On granite cliffs, where orchids splendid
Their springtime fragrance subtly spread,
The echoes rose and rolled and ended —
The scion of his race was dead!
Roughly bred, but their hearts of gold are
Soft as the hearts of womenkind;
Bold as the best are they and bolder
Who left him there to sun and wind.
They left him there; and riding slowly,
Even as one may leave a foe
Vanquished, aye, but nowise lowly
Nor sired by caitiffs mean and low,
Came to the stockyard by the clearing
And saw the gallows as they tqrned
And said, at heart, the home-fire nearing,
“The wild bull’s death was nobly earned.”
VICTORIA.

Time Payment.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. LATIMER listlessly boarded the
tram which conveyed her five and a
half days a week from the big
general store to her cheap boarding-house.
The vehicle was crowded with other workers
and she pushed her way inside. A man rose
and offered her his seat. Too tired to thank
him, she just sank into it. Between the
time she left the store and 6.30, the tea
hour, she was usually in a state approaching
semi-consciousness—too weary to fully ex-
perience the discomfort of the journey or
to revolt at thp monotony of life generally.
She was 42, of big build, faded.
Vacantly she turned her head towards a
girl sitting on the thin wedge of seat at her
side. The latter was scanning an evening
newspaper, and Mrs. Latimer’s eyes passed
on to a blur of print and illustration. She
did not observe the girl stare discouragingly;
she had closed her eyes and for a few
seconds was nearly asleep. A jolt of the
tram aroused her and she gazed at the paper
again.
“A. J. Stewart.” The name in heavy black
type caught her eye and stirred her memory
faintly. Then with a terrific intensity she
realised the meaning of that name. She
tried to decipher a few sentences. “Albert
Jerome Stewart returns tp the land of his
birth after an absence of twenty-two years. ..
Penniless when he sailed from hene in
1905.... returns a millionaire.... famous for
his”....
The print, a foot distant, became a
jumbled blur again, but she yas no longer
half-awake. For the first time in years she
was excited —her mind was tingling with
old emotions and memories: she trembled.
But gradually out of the confusion came a
fueling of hate —a recurrence of that tremen-
dous rage which had died away years ago, as
most emotions will without food to feed them.
So he had returned to the land of his birth
a success ! The horror of the moment when
she had first read- his letter, the brutalitv
and degradation of the years following,
returned to her in their full vehemence. Her
mind became a whirlpool of old emotions—
hates and fears and sorrows.
The conductor called out “Cardigan
Square,” and instinctively she arose and
pushed her way out. Deep in retrospect she
reached the footpath and walked in the
direction of her boarding-house. An idea
suddenly occurred and she changed her
course for a newsagent’s. Vaguely a plan was
shaning itself. She bought the evening paper
and hurried home. Inside she
the privacy of her room, where she read the
item, word for word, deliberately subjugating
her agitati n. Then she laid back on the
bed,
Paramount in her mind was disapproba-
tion of the Fates-—or God. Was it fair
that this man should return to Australia,
wealthy, successful, whilst she had had to
slave to live and rear his child? He was
the wrongdoer—he had been the sole cause
of her unhappy years—he had leaned any
chance she might have had of happy mar-
riage. And her son—his son—worked in
greasy overalls whilst the father lived in
luxury. That son —Heaven above ! —had he
been worth it? Was he sufficient payment
for all those years of deception, struggle,
fear —that devastating dread that someone
would come to the shop or boarding-house
and say: “She is not married. She has no
right to call herself Mrs. Latimer!”
But she had not been a weak, sentimental
girl. There was no easy virtue about her.
She had been engaged to be married —her
“box” prepared, all details arranged—when
that letter came. “He couldn’t go on with
it.” No other explanation. She had thought
over that phrase exhaustively, but there was
no further meaning to be gained. Simply he
had discovered later than most men that he
had not loved her sufficiently. He had not
considered her future. He had not weighed
the condomnation of the world —her relatives
and friends: they would not despise him half
as much as they would her. She recalled
the terror of the first months, her decision
to fly anywhere from sneering glances and
covert words.
She did not know that she made her own
complete hell by thinking too deeply—that
most women would have forgotten every-
thing in a few years and made a fresh start,
no matter how daunting the circumstances.
It was her way to consider herself damned
and to ruminate interminably on what might
have been —or what should have been. After
ten years of twisted meditation even her
mental capacity for the subject exhausted
itself and she became almost an automaton.,
dividing her thoughts between work and her
son.
• Revenge—that was what she wanted!
She did not realise that she was only one
of the million sightless people crying out
against the partisanship of the gods—she
must take retribution into her own hands.
She would get even. She would pay him
for her wasted life, for all her agonies and
sorrows.
Childlike in its simplicity her mind revolved
around methods of violence; but even in her
cold fury she grasped that that would not be
the best way. If she killed him there would
be more torture for her —and he would
really be the better off. No; there was surely
a better way than that.
She racked her brains feverishly, but.
became appalled at her own impotence. How
could she —a nobody—harm a wealthy
visitor? Surely God would show her some
way to obtain justice. Surely—but He
did not help people like her. Had He helped
her in the years of her struggle? No—any
retribution would be of her making!
Hate sharpened her wits and she grasped
that the sure way to revenge would be to
ruin his personal standing. The newspaper,
she remembered, had made much of his posi-
tion, not only financially but socially and
politically. What better weapon than his
treatment of her —his flight—his illegitimate
son! That was it. His illegitimate son!
She would make the affair public. The let-
ters he had written —all the other proofs she
had kept safely put away. He would pay.
What did she care now about the reflection
on herself —or her son? He was young and
would get over it. Anyway, there had never
been any real love between them, There had
been too much about him to remind her of
the father. She had not been a good mother,
but she had done her duty by him. He was
a man now and could look after himself. She
wanted her revenge. She would have it.
After twenty-two years of waiting! To be
hers!
She arose, washed herself, and did her
hair. Then she took her best dress out of
the wardrobe. She would not let him see
that she had had hard times —whilst he would
be w T ell clad and well groomed. She would
show him that she had come through all
right despite him. All the years she had
thought of him as he had been on their
last meeting—big, red-faced, laughing. She
had thought of him pitying her —even
smiling contemptuously. She dressed care-
fully, putting on a clean pair of stockings
and her best shoes. She was glad now that
she had retained the “Sunday-clothes” habit
of her youth. She arranged her good hat
satisfactorily and then surveyed the result
in the wardrobe mirror. Yes, she looked all
right.
Downstairs, she called the landlady. “Tell
my son when he arrives home that I have
gone out. I don’t want any tea.”
* * * *
The newspaper had disclosed the hotel
where he was staying, and Mrs. Latimer found
it without difficulty after twenty-minutes’
ride in the tram. The clerk advised her that
Mr. Stewart was expected back any minute
and to wait in the lounge. She sat alone
in a far corner. The contrast between her
present surroundings and the boarding-
house served to heighten her anger.
He came at last, and for a brief moment
she thought she had made a mistake —that
the name was a coincidence. But soon the
few points of resemblance between this
man and her former lover became apparent.
Tall and gaunt he stood over her. She stared
up at his emaciated face, wonderingly; the
rage which she had been nourishing was
momentarily displaced.
He was pale and quivering a little and he
spoke hesitantly:
“Did you want to see me?”
So he did not recognise her! The fresh
indignity aroused her hate to its full force,
but she controlled her voice.
“Drn’t you remember me—Mary Walton?”
He passed his hand over his brow.
“Why—I—Mary Walton.” He was strug-
gling to recall her. “Why. yes. of course.
You must excuse me. I’ve been upset
to-rpght. Mary Walton! How are you?”
He held out his hand automatically and
dropped it again. His voice was without
enthusiasm; the worried expression on his
face did not change one iota.
She flamed inwardly. “Don’t you remem-
ber what happened just before you left Aus-
tralia?”
A ghost of a smile flitted across his face.
“Oh, yes. Boy and girl affair wasn’t it?

What an eternity has passed since then.
Dear me! What an age ago that seems
now.” His face became more haggard.
“What has happened since then!”
His attitude bewildered her. How could
she survive any strong emotion with a man
like this?
He went on “I’ve had an awful time the
last few years, Mary. Made money, you
know, and all that, but my health’s gone.”
She nodded speechlessly.
His glance craved sympathy. “You’re an
old friend, so I’ll tell you. I’m dying.
Internal cancer—it’s —it’s torture !” He
sank into, an armchair at her side, burying
his face in his hands. “I’m alone in the
world, too. My wife died years ago—and
there were no children to comfort me. It’s
—it’s not fair. I don’t deserve it!”
She watched him unpityingly, trium-
phantly. So she had not suffered alone. He
yras getting his share. Her heart beat with
a wild, ungodly ecstasy—his reward ! There
was no need for her to do anything to get
Accounts were square—more than
square. He was dying—comfortless. She
floated inwardly. This was payment enough
for all the desolate years. He was without
\yife and children to comfort him, but she
bad health and her son—her son ! She would
keep this a secret now. He might rob her
of him. She had not realised before all the
happiness she could get from being a good
mother —but she would be different.
. He looked up suddenly and tried to muster
his self-possession. “I’m sorry, Mary, for
worrying you with my troubles. But I’m
upset to-night. Had a shock. I’m glad to
see you. You married, of course?”
“Any children?”
“No.”
“I’m stopping here for a few weeks. Per-
haps I can look you up. What’s your name
now, Mary?”
“Mrs Latimer.”
He nodded, and there was silence for an
interval.
“Latimer, did you say?” he asked suddenly.
Then: “Strange that should be your name.
That was the young fellow’s name—what
upset me, you know. Poor young fellow!
No fault of mjne—or his, for that matter.
Just one of those accidents that happen.
. Poor fellow—he died less than an hour ago !”
Her face whitened; she clenched her
hands.
“W-where did this happen?” She strug-
gled to govern her voice.
“Tramway-construction job—near Ferris-
street. Dangerous job with so much traffic
about, in my opinion. It shouldn’t be
allowed without better safeguards. Poor
young chap!”
She rose abruptly, and he stared in sur-
prise at her tragic uplifted face.
/ “Mary—what’s the matter?” He arose,
. too.
Her repression broke down. “You—you
fiend!” she cried out hysterically. “When
you gave me the child it was a curse. Now
that I want him above anything you take
.‘him from me. O God!”
v Sobbing she ran from the room.

Copi and Cockleshell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE big mob from North Queensland
had been delivered, and the boss drover
had returned to his home by train.
The rest of the stockmen were waiting to
spend Christmas —and their cheques—at the
township. All except Copi, the blackboy
horsetailer who didn’t drink and who
also had very little money, for in lieu of
wages lie had accepted the shabby double-
seated buggy that had served as drover’s
turn-out on the trip, and the pair of pie-
bald ponies. True, the ponies were very
old and one of them had a hip down, but
they were still fat and frisky.
Copi was now painting the trap, working
diligently in the shade of a tree that grew
by the sandy beach, daubing on bright green
and crimson colors. About noon each day
half a score of local blacks usually came to
swim opposite the beach, and he often
watched them. Sometimes he would saun-
ter shyly to the water’s edge and, squatting
on his heels, would gaze silently; then, as
the others came out to hask he would slink
back to his camp. But that was only until
he saw Cockleshell, the eighteen-year-old
belle of the tribe.
Cockleshell was good to look at; lipr teeth
were small and white and she smiled often,
and to most of the young bucks alluringly;
and the string of cockle-shells she wore at
her neck tinkled musically with every move-
ment. After that day Copi came always
and waited and watched, not heeding the
others as they frolicked and sported about
him. His eyes were only for the girl, and
before long, with the unerring instinct of
her sex, she knew that she had but to look
and he would be at her feet.
Came a day when, the rest of them hav-
ing waded out and strolled back to the
camp, she stayed in the water, splashing
and swimming this way and that, floating
close past him, chin and nose just feather-
ing the surface of the water. Then, turning
suddenly she dived and came up almost at
his side, shook her dripping hair and
beckoned. Copi was on his feet in a second
and strode to her, his lips tight and his eyes
shining. A pace from her, he hesitated. She
came forward; he caught the necklet, and
fingered it, saying again and again, “Little
Wood-Duck, little black girl!”
Cockleshell’s lips formed a half smile,
and remained so, just parted; her nostrils
expanded to their utmost, and the pupils of
her black eyes enlarged till the irises
were only tiny rings. Thus she held him,
as a snake may hold a bird, watching him
closely; and, seeing no sign of the beast in
his face, she was glad.
For three full days Cockleshell swam and
paddled or sunbaked in the sand, and Copi
did not come. Yet sometimes she saw him
moving about his camp. On the fourth day
he was down early; but the girl sauntered
past, nose tilted and eyes fixed straight
ahead.
“Cockleshell, little black girl, come here!
Copi want you,” he called. Cockleshell
sniffed and tossed her head like a cornered
brumby. As he held up for her inspection
what appeared to be a bundle of shells, she
sniffed again; but as he spread them out
and then adjusted them about her, she
softened and smiled, for no girl, white or
black, had ever before possessed such a
bathing-dress. There were shells every-
where, scraped and polished till the mother-
o’-pearl in them looked like opal. From
shoulders to waist little periwinkles were
criss-crossed and festooned till they reached
the girdle of cockle-shells; the back portions
of two small tortoise-shells made breast-
shields ; and from waist to knees swept a
dense silver fringe of flexible sinews from
the tails of kangaroos.
Cockleshell danced in glee. “You been
makem?” she asked.
“Your Copi been makem. Three day an’
three night. Christmas-box loijga little
Wood-Duck, little black girl,” he answered.
Next day Copi was again absent from the
beach; but on the following morning he met
her early.
“Come an’ Copi show little Wood-Duck
something,” he confided; and while the rest
of the tribe were dozing in the afternoon,
they stole off. Out past the furthest big
timber of the river he led her, across a
red-soil plain, till they came to a clump
of hopbush, in the midst of which there was
a tall and leafy kurrajong that had a supple-
jack vine entwining it.
At the foot of it he stopped and, pointing
upward, said “Come on, little Wood-Duck,
and see the nest Copi has built for you.”
He clambered up and she followed him,
and where the highest branches clustered
together and formed a natural canopy he had
fashioned a sturdy couch of poles and bark,
bound firmly with strips of kangaroo-skin,
and had covered them with a thick mat of
hopbush branches, and spread side by side on
top of this were two great emu skins. And
there for the rest of the day they talked of
many things, chief among them Copi’s buggy
and pair of piebald ponies. He told her
they were to be his wedding present to her,
and Cockleshell smiled and wriggled up close
to him. And after that they spent many
Arcadian days in their little leafy bower.
All might have gone on happily but for the
arrival of Archie, a flash tracker from the
big town. Archie with his new Christmas
uniform, bright buttons, peaked cap and
polished high-boots, was a sheik of sheiks,
who knew the power of his own personality
where women were concerned. Openly he
jeered at the hand-made bathing-dress Copi
had given the girl, and spoke disdainfully of
Copi himself as “that Queensland nigger.”
On his arrival from the township next day he
brought a skin-tight costume striped with
many colors and handed it to Cockleshell;
and at that his victory was complete. As
she capered gleefully around him, he caught
her and kissed her, and then suspended at
her breast a crowning glory, one of those
burnished bronze rising suns which the Dig-
gers used to wear on their hats !
Yet Cockleshell must have had pricks of
conscience; for as Copi slunk back to the
sha'dows of his camp she said wistfully:
“Copi got the buggy and piebald ponies, an’
he promised them to me.”
Archie had, however, expected this thrust
and was prepared. “Cripes,” he said, “old
horses and trap! These are the good days,
an’ I got the motor-car. I bin fetch him
to-morrow. You see that feller —him be yours
some day.”
Next day a car did indeed herald its
approach by a series of sounds that could
only be compared to a whirlwind wrecking
a corrugated-iron woolshed, and with many
grunts and jerks it pulled up on the bank
above the beach. As the engine finished its
struggles, small heat-waves danced about the
radiator bonnet, while the empty lamps gaped
like the eye-sockets in a skull. The sagging
canvas hood was held in position by strands
of fencing-wire. Nevertheless it was a car,
and Cockleshell was a proud girl as she
seated herself on one of the tattered cushions.
Although Archie’s uniform was starting to
show evidence of having been slept in and his
riding-trousers had many splashes of mud and
sardine oil, he still preened himself before
Cockleshell and she was still fascinated. They
were together all day. A dozen times Archie
cranked and cranked and poured water and
petrol and curses on the engine, but was
unable to get a move out of it; and no one
heard it leave through the night. At day-
break it was gone, nevertheless, and with it
Cockleshell.
Copi spoke to no one, but by ten o’clock
his baggage was in the half-painted trap and
the ponies harnessed. The local blacks paid
no heed to him, and treated his departure
with the same indifference as they did
Cockleshell’s elopement. He had no diffi-
culty in following the wobbling tracks of the
old car. All day the old ponies jogged on;
and at each sandhill, as they slowed down
to a walk, Copi saw r many traces of trouble
—here the car had jibbed, and there for a
mile footprints showed that the girl had been
pushing and shoving—and by sundown he
knew that he was overtaking them. That
night when he camped he hobbled the ponies,
but did not bell them, lest the fugitives
might hear them and guess that he was close
on their heels.
In the morning, a mile or so on he came to
the spot where the others had camped. The
fire was still smoking, and there was much
evidence of engine trouble. Long poles had
been used as fulcrums, and an empty tin
showed that the last of the petrol was in the
tank.
In less than an hour, as he breasted a low
hill, he saw them ahead of him, the pair
of them on the ground, heaving and straining
at the*car. As he whipped up the old ponies
to make a final dash, he heard a report and
saw a puff of smoke and a flame ; and when
he did reach them the car was a red-hot mass
of twisted iron and smouldering rubber.
He did not speak to them till he had
turned his team round and drawn up beside
them. His voice was then sharp and authori-
tative.
“You jump in, little black girl, an’ come
longa me,” he commanded. Cockleshell
needed no second bidding.
Then, turning to his vanquished rival, he
said: “You hop in, too —at the back. I
want the gate-opener.”
