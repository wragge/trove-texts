Back to Earth
WHEN the Ky visit was first
announced, even some of the
wholehearted supporters of our
Vietnam commitment were appre-
hensive. If they did not say so, it
was simply through fear of being
associated with Mr. Calwell’s out-
bursts. But at the time the visit
did seem a risk, and an unnecessary
one. Premier Ky was a flamboyant
man with a record of reckless
statements, and it was obvious that
there would be a lot of nastiness
and some emotion generated.
In fact, after the event, all but
the most hardened critics have
changed their minds and pro-
nounced the visit a success. Premier
Ky performed better than anyone
expected. Although attacked with
unprecedented viciousness, he acted
with great dignity, answering the
charges against him without even
the slightest bitterness. He was
never deterred from his job of
expounding his country’s cause, and
he did this more eloquently and
ably than anyone had expected.
He put the issues with obvious
sincerity and offered his people’s
thanks for our contribution to the
common cause. He went out of his
way to talk of the “other war.”
There is nothing like a contro-
versial visit of this kind for arousing
interest among ordinary people
and getting the issues before them.
The success of the venture is there-
fore also a tribute to Prime
Minister Holt. It would have been
very easy for him to have followed
a No Risks policy, quietly brushed
off Premier Ky’s request to come
here, and taken things quietly. It
is to his credit that he was pre-
pared to give it a go.
The most important immediate
outcome of the visit should be an
increase in civilian aid to Vietnam.
That country’s hospitals, schools,
and refugee centres are grossly
inadequate and there is a great
deal we can do to alleviate the
suffering and help the reconstruc-
tion. The present level of civilian
aid at $2 million is pathetically
inadequate.
But important though Vietnam
is, the Government should not get
so obsessed with it that the other
problems, domestic and foreign,
are neglected. It is all to the good,
for example, that hardworking Mr.
Hasluck is soon to slip off to
Indonesia. The political situation
in Djakarta grows increasingly
healthy month by month as the
“Old Order” is gradually eroded
away. But the stability of the new
regime will soon come to depend
on whether it can deliver the goods
and right the wrongs of the
Sukarno-PKI period of chaos.
Australia must act vigorously to
establish constructive relationships
with the new Government and be
prepared to spend more. This, too,
will require some of Mr. Holt’s
flair for publicity.
It is also worth reminding Mr.
Holt, who is soon off on visits to
New Zealand, Malaysia, and
several other Asian countries, that
he had better not forget domestic
affairs. Certainly, after the era of
Menzies neglect, we need a Prime
Minister who will establish con-
tacts with the countries of the
region, but it does not all need to
be done personally. There are
plenty of things at home requiring
his attention. To name just a few,
Federal-State relations are in more
of a mess than ever, the economy
should be more lively, and there
are difficult problems in education
policy requiring the Holt touch.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Ky: Here to Say “Thanks”
Arthur Calwell’s “mass demonstration” in Canberra
As his Air Force plane took off for Brisbane last Friday morning, Canberra
assessed the Ky visit as successful beyond all expectations. The dapper gay little pilot
showed himself to be a great deal more than this image which hung in our minds.
He projected himself as a big and
complex man. Underneath the small
slick exterior, he showed as a deter-
minedly good man. Only such a man
could have—-at the end of an hour and
a half of speechmaking and question
answering stood up again at the
National Press Club luncheon and made
a very moving declaration. Although
unfortunately not televised, it is worth
recalling the words he spoke, words
which moved a number of those present
near to tears and had the crowd at the
Hotel Canberra scramble from their
jam-packed chairs to give the con-
troversial visitor a standing ovation.
Premier Ky said: “I would like once
again to extend my thanks to all of
you, because we realise now after 24
hours that you are very real gentlemen.
You treat us in very fair manner and
give us the opportunity not only to
talk with you but to explain to you our
situation, our cause, our hopes, and in-
tentions ... a way all gentlemen in a
democratic country do ... I don’t
think violence or -demonstrations can
bring something concrete. But with my
19 months’ experience back in my
country, I have had many experiences
of demonstrations. One more, one less,
it doesn’t disturb me.”
Stopping and raising his voice, he
said slowly: “I believe that we defend
the right cause. I believe that I am a
free man. We are the free men in Viet-
nam. And we are fighting not only for
the 15 to 20 million Vietnamese, but
we are fighting for freedom. And I
believe in my destiny.
“I believe in the destiny of my
country and this is a wonderful day
for me, my wife, and the members of
my delegation. I hope that through your
articles . . . please explain to millions
of Australians what kind of man I am,
what kind of men we are in South
Vietnam, and what kind of war we are
fighting now in Vietnam.”
He affirmed his own dedication to
the cause: “I am still poor. I do not
have my own car, I don’t even have my
own house. And I am not here for power
... So I am always confident and very
proud of myself and my family and my
colleagues and my comrades in arms.
Some day when peace arrives, when
we have a better way of life, when our
people will not suffer longer from war,
I am sure we will remember Aus-
tralians, and thank you.”
For journalists who followed him
around, watching him and putting ques-
tions at two long Press conferences,
meeting him and his delegation drinks
in hand, observing his reaction to
demonstrators and seeing wreath-laying
ceremonies and—last but not leatst—
admiring his stunning wife, this summed
up in an accentuated manner the un-
publicised substance of the man.
He came to Australia to thank. He
thanked wth eloquence for the 600
operations a month being performed by
surgical teams, for the million and a
halt school textbooks, and for the hard
bodily task being done by Australian
soldiers. He spoke interestingly of the
task, “made harder and bloodier by the
conditions under which we are forced
to defend ourselves, by the difficulty of
the terrain, by the cold-bloodedness of
the foe, and by the peculiar, blind stub-
bornness of the leaders of the aggres-
sion.”
For those who are upset at the acci-
dental deaths from aerial bombing of
military targets in the North, he pro-
vided a reminder. He spoke of the
bombing of the South. Lest we forget
in our sorrow for some hundreds of
innocent North Vietnamese civilians
who die as a by-product of efforts to
weaken the base of aggression, he re-
minded us of the nature and scale of
that aggression.
The three-year-old daughter of a
hamlet chief kidnapped and murdered;
doctors, priests, monks, welfare workers
and nurses slaughtered, busloads of
schoolchildren mined, village elders
mutilated, farmers knifed; places of
worship, hospitals, village meeting-
places set to torch; rice confiscated;
journalists, elected Parliamentarians
shot in the streets and prisoners
machine-gunned Gestapo-style. The
17,000 known civilian deaths and inesti-
mable civilian misery and destruction;
not to speak of the military side of the
war.
He spoke of the origins of the war—
Ho’s statement in 1959 that the revolu-
tions must be brought to the South;
northern Communist Party secretary Le
Duan’s 1960 call for the establishment
of a National Liberation Front in the
South “under the leadership of the
Marxist-Leninist party,” and the estab-
lishment of the front of faceless men
to try to provide a semblance of
indigenous support.
JTOR the first time Premier Ky ad-
mitted that in June, 1965, before
the Allied build-up, “the Communists
were winning on the field of battle.” The
tide has turned, but “military victory
is not enough,” because there is the
other war “to give our people a life
of decency and self-respect.” Coining a
new phrase, he mentioned “the war for
our land and the war for our people.”
Journalists had to go behind the back
of Premier Ky to find out the pro-
gress of the second war. I spoke briefly
with four other members of the dele-
gation, the youthful lively Minister for
Revolutionary Development, Nguyen
Due Thang, and three members of the
Constituent Assembly. Mr. Thang
talked of the 26,000 young men out in
the countryside administering Govern-
ment help and attempting to mobilise
local self-help. There are great problems
of training and control, but in less than
a year ten percent of the country has
been covered.
Mr. Thang’s main fear is that they


are being forced to expand too fast.
He was too tactful to criticise the
Americans directly, but there was an
implicit criticism in his statement, “I
believe very much in the importance of
building something solid in the country-
side. No one can push me to do things
for mere publicity.” I asked him about
priorities for Australian assistance. He
put them as follows: soldiers first, to
establish security without which nothing
can be done; military doctors and
engineers next, to begin reconstruction
right behind the combat troops; and
third, civilian aid once the villages are
more secure.
Members of the Constituent
Assembly spoke of the constitution they
are drafting. As Dr. Nham said at
the Press Club luncheon, members of
the Assembly hope to have an elected
President within six months of the
adoption of the Constitution, which
will soon be completed. They see a
number of points of possible dispute
with the ruling Directory. The
Directory may, they think, want to
postpone the Presidential elections for
12 or 18 months. It may also want
emergency powers interpreted broadly.
But the Constituent Assembly mem-
bers were insistent that their body
would not be tamecat, that it would
mobilise its two-thirds majority to over-
rule unreasonable amendments to the
Constitution which the Directory might
submit. They insisted that they had
ultimate power already. In particular,
they said that the only parts of the
Constitution unlikely to come into
operation immediately are those guar-
anteeing complete freedom of the
Press and freedom of assembly. But
they believe that the representative
Parliament will have relatively un-
restricted powers.
The visit did not throw much new
light on Premiers Ky’s political future.
He did not say specifically that he
would not stand for the Presidency.
Rather implausibly, given his obvious
political abilities, he said again he did
not like politics and preferred the life
of a pilot. He has obviously not
decided yet, though as he said a mini-
mum age limit of 40 would leave him
with no dilemma.
Ky did say some quite new things.
First he predicted that mopping-up
operations following the ending of
Northern support for the war would
take only three years. Secondly he
admitted that the South has guerilla
agents in the North, though the fact
that the North has made so little fuss
about them suggests an operation of
small size.
One of the largest placards outside
the Canberra Hotel read: “Ignore Cal-
well, Australians Do.” And that was
pretty right. The Leader of the
Opposition, having called for “the big-
gest anti-Fascist, anti-war demonstra-
tions in Canberra’s history,” and having
called on all his Parliamentary col-
leagues to join him, walked with only
ten of them at the head of a smallish
500 strong procession. It was very
much a Communist show, with Viet
Cone flags and signs reading “Long
Live” Ho Chi Minh.”
Tom Uren even found it too muck
and remonstrated with a hot-headed
gent who had an effigy of Ky hanging
from a small gallows. A Eureka
Youth League activist led the crowd in
chanting slogans, and your correspon-
dent got a little roughed up when one
of his Left-wing friends said loudly
he was a security man. Most of the
crowd were from Sydney.
Mr. Calwell made a familiar speech,
in which he repeated his well-knowa
Tanner
"...And I want to thank you for making my visit such a success."

charges against Ky for the ump-
teenth time. The most noteworthy
feature was his hostility to “those who
would betray our principles.” Listing
the evil forces which had combined to
bring about the recent election debacle
—the Capitalist Press, the National
Civic Council, etc. —he was interrupted
by a strong-voiced interjector: “Whit-
lam.” And there were cries of “Judas,”
“Yes, what about Judas?” Mr. Calwell
hesitated as if about to explicitly join
with the crowd. But he restrained
himself and went on to a peroration
about the need for unity and loyalty to
principle. He spoke vigorously of a
Labor victory in 1969.
I spoke to Mr. Calwell afterwards,
commenting that he had spoken as if
he would like to lead the party at the
next election. His reply was: “Ah, yes
(pause) . . . But I am 70 and it de-
pends on what the others think. The
main thing is that the party stick to its
principles.” To the question “Are you
frightened it might not,” he replied,
“Well, I’m frightened it might not if
one man gets control.”
The Canberra demonstrations
dwindled quickly in size and spirit as
the visit proceeded. At the last recep-
tion Mr. Holt beamed as only our Prime
Minister can beam, and other Ministers
and officials were jubilant, too. A cal-
culated risk had borne handsome re-
turns. Or as the PM insisted: “I exer-
cised my judgment about the man, and
happily that judgment was vindicated.”
PETER SAMUEL
The Key
WITHIN one minute on the night
of January 18, television gave
anyone in Australia who cared
to see the answer many of us had been
seeking (and probably seeking so
assiduously because it contained an
elusive pun) the key to Premier Ky,
to the man and the reason behind his
visit.
Within that first minute of watching
and hearing him “live,” television
showed us a very human soul turned
by an Asian-French key, and I would
say more French than Asian. This
could easily be missed, and even next
day more than one competent TV
reviewer said something like “A few
odd tricks of emphasis, inflections in the
wrong place and (un) Australian vowels
added interest to his speech.”
To an unashamed francophile the
tricks and inflections were merely a
reminder that Premier Ky, aged 36,
was largely French influenced and, at
least on the surface, thinks and acts
French more than he does Vietnamese,
particularly in translating his thoughts
(with very French hand actions) into
his “third language,” English.
Add French urbanity (sometimes you
could close your eyes and imagine
Chevalier on the screen), tenacity, and
the contrary attributes to an Asian and
Buddhist background, and it was easy
to see that this was not a soul able to


fit the black-and-white diagrams favored
by Arthur Calwell “dictator, butcher,
Fascist, murderer.”
There are all kinds -of shades of
opinion. As Premier Ky’s image first
appeared on the screen, and after he
had read from his address for a minute
or so, someone in my hearing said,
“So that’s Premier Ky! Well, I would
sooner walk down the road to see him
than Johnson.”
I doubt this was a typical Australian
viewer’s reaction, however. Television
viewing of the first two days of the Ky
visit showed clearly what one might
have guessed would be the general
temper “who cares?” No crowds
stormed Fairbairn Base in Canberra
or lined the route into the city. Demon-
strations were permitted, but almost no
one bothered.
Whether Premier Ky is a complex
and devious man, or an honest and
direct human being doing his best in
a difficult world, I think television
showed us. The general opinion would
be that he was “a good enough bloke.”
Someone else of my acquaintance said
that he had more impact than anyone
since the Kennedy of the Kennedy-
Nixon television debate.
Premier Ky’s command of his “third
language” and his lack of shuffling in
replying to questions won the night for
him, the first time up. I was less im-
pressed the second time, when at the
National Press Club luncheon he
merely seemed to be repeating the
American line, markedly without so
much as a nod for the overwhelming
American presence. As he spoke, one
would have thought that the Aus-
tralians and South Vietnamese were do-
ing it all.
This was so patently not so that it
became an increasingly obvious flaw
in the man’s personality as laid bare
before us. The Press mentioned that
Premier Ky liked to pretend that the
policies being pursued in Vietnam were
his own rather than dictated by cir-
cumstances, but it was a point Press
questioners might have pursued.
Once again, television showed the
Press to be feeble in probing and analy-
sis. Within the first minute of the first
confrontation an opportunity was
missed when Premier Ky said, “We
have been fighting now for 20 years.”
Not an opportunity to doubt that state-
ment, but to discover the viewpoint be-
hind it.
Shortly after, he was asked, “Do you
think the majority of the people of
South Vietnam understand the reasons
for the war, and is it a fact that many
of these people consider the Viet Cong
to be patriots?” The first part of the
question was, as it probably deserved
to be, ignored and the answer to the
second part was, virtually, a simple
“No.”
There was a distinct shortage of the
succinct, direct question which calls for
an unequivocal answer, which can be
forced if not at once forthcoming. The
long, showy question seemed the general
rule.
For a non-politician who disclaims
any ambition to remain long in politics,
Premier Ky dealt with such questions
as ably and in much the same manner
as any politician would, by nimbly
avoiding most of the prickles.
This is not to question Premier Ky’s
sincerity, but the Press’ inability to
force a politician into any deeper water
than he chooses; and in such interview-
conferences, televised, the fault be-
comes television’s by association.
If Premier Ky tricked us all, as Mr.
Calwell declared, it was television’s
fault. Because television allowed him to
present himself to us as wordly and
wise, forthright and charming, and
blessed with a sense of humor. (What
a marvellous compere he would make.)
And none of these things, may I point
out, has Mr. Calwell been able to do;
wherein, surely, there lies a lesson?
FRANK ROBERTS
Why Did Calwell Avoid Ky?
Labor Leader Calwell announced publicly recently that he would go to Hanoi,.
Moscow, anywhere, to help toward peace in Vietnam. But he refused to sit com-
fortably in his office at Parliament House, Canberra, and let Vietnamese Premier Ky
(who heads the Administration of South Vietnam, a major belligerent) give hist
viewpoint and reply to the charge from Calwell that he had been responsible for
the murder of President Diem—a charge that even the Communists do not make.
Deputy Opposition Leader Gough
Whitlam, a contender for future leader-
ship of the Labor Party, disappeared
wraithlike and mute as a Sydney rock
oyster into the outer fastnesses of
Queensland, though he had eaten
Premier Ky’s food and drunk his liquor
during a recent Vietnam visit (as an
official representative of the ALP).
Dr. Jim Cairns (Vic.), another
aspirant for Labor leadership, was re-
ported as putting his imprimatur upon
the attitudes taken by Calwell, by
austerely criticising any of his fellow
Labor parliamentarians who did not
participate in anti-Ky demonstrations as
failing in their “active political duty.”
Mr. Frank Crean (Vic.), a third
would-be Labor leader, has followed
Cairns in supporting the Calwellian
actions by applauding the demonstra-
tion proposals. Put those things together
and you can see why many people are
losing interest in who is or is not going
to lead the Labor Party in the im-
mediate future, and that includes me,
whose job it is to study politics.
Personally, I thought that Ky, despite
the terrible charges levelled against him
by Calwell, showed himself basically
more liberal in his approach (as well
as much more polite) than Calwell.
When Communist journalist Harry
Stein, who represents the Sydney Com-
munist “Tribune,” challenged Ky on
whether his Administration or the
National Liberation Front (the Com-
munist organisation) controlled the
majority of the people and most of
South Vietnam, Ky said, “Come and see
for yourself.”
Ky replied broadly, but quite con-
vincingly, to the charges that he had
had a hand in the murder of President
Diem, fought for Vichy France, bombed
Algerian Nationalists, and was taking
Uo next steps toward promoting
democracy in his country.
These are charges that Calwell and
other Labor spokesmen have sprinkled
among such colorful descriptions of Ky
as “a miserable little butcher,” “a
murderer,” and the like. And I am sick
to the back teeth of Labor politicians
(most of whom seem to have seen Ky
on TV either at his Press conference
or the National Press Club luncheon)
saying, “When he replied such-and-such,
you fellows should have asked him
such-and-such.”
Ky offered them, through their leader,
an unequalled opportunity to develop,,
uninterrupted, a line of questioning
something which is not possible at a
Press conference where a man is being-
questioned by a crowd of people, all
with equal right to ask a question. Ky
made his offer to Calwell graciously and
with politeness. Asked if during his
visit he would give Calwell the oppor-
tunity to present the charges against
him, if necessary in a documented form,
Ky said, “The question is, does Mr.
Calwell allow me to see him.”
As I see it, Calwell and the Labor
Party have as much explaining to do
as Premier Ky. Has Labor become so
infected with the anti-American virus-
of the Communist Party and its own
Left Wing that now it will deal only
with those who are anti-American? Why
be prepared to go to Hanoi, or Peking
if necessary, and refuse to see Ky?
Even if Ky were “a miserable little
butcher” (and he has denied it while
Calwell has not established it), could
riot a record of equal if not greater
butchery be compiled against both
Peking and Hanoi?
fs the blood that stains their hands
different in color? If the cause of peace
is served by being willing to deal with
“big butchers,” why discriminate against
a “little butcher”? Or is it that Labor
has tended to develop over recent years
an ideological bias toward the “bigger
butcher”?
Leaving out whether Ky’s visit turns
out to have been a personal triumph
for him or not, it was a fiasco
deservedly for Calwell, his would-be
successors, and the Labor Party
generally.
It is against this background that I
raise the question of whether it is worth
while maintaining an interest in who,
after February 8, when the Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party has its first
post-election meeting, is to lead it. On
the form shown thus far in 1967 it will
not matter.

Well, the
National RQISBS is
more than a dictating
machine, it’s a portable
tape recorder. It
plays and records for
3 hours (not 40 minutes), has
2 speeds (not just 1): 17/sl 7 /s for dictation
and 3% i.p.s. for finer musical effects.
So when your secretary hangs up her ear-
phones for the night you whisk the
National home and soak up some music
from the large 6" cabinet speaker. (Most
dictating machines make do with a smaller,
one housed in the mike.) And when you’re
dictating with the RQISBS, you can
switch to “auto-voice” to catch your words
and not your pauses. So why lavish more
on a 1-speed dictating machine? $189.95
buys you a 2-speed, 9-transistor National
tape recorder.

Brisbane: First Hostilities
After the sober speeches and Press questionings of Canberra, the second stage of
Premier Ky’s Australian tour began in Brisbane with two new experiences: on
arriving at the airport the Kys mingled with a moderately friendly crowd, and that
evening in front of their hotel the Vietnamese Premier saw his first large group of
hostile demonstrators.
To judge from an early view of the
airport, the Brisbane leg of the tour
would be something of a flop. A few
carloads of the curious braved midday
traffic to Eagle Farm, but most of the
crowd of 200 around the international
terminal were airport staff seeking a
break and passengers waiting.
The arrival of the Kys’ Viscount
pulled a few more spectators out of
the Ansett and TAA terminals but
when the couple made an elegant de-
scent they received a polite ripple of
hand clapping and a few throat-clear-
ing cheers; it was not until the Kys,
accompanied by Premier Nicklin and
Minister of Education and Police Pizzey,
moved off the prescribed course to
approach one barrier to shake hands
and exchange a few words with the
crowd that any enthusiasm built up.
That evening in front of Lennons
Hotel was rather different. About 150
demonstrators were gathered on the
pavement across George Street from
the main entrance, and immediately
alongside them a smaller group of Ky
supporters. The police, more cautious
since President Johnson was nearly
swept off his feet on the same spot, had
a stout wooden barrier, a line of police-
men shoulder to shoulder facing the
crowd, plus a flying wedge to reinforce
the line at any point, and police cars
galore.
Anti - Ky demonstrators waved
placards, most of which were snatched
and torn up by police once the demon-
stration really got going. They also had
balloons with anti-Ky slogans, but these
added an inappropriately festive air.
They also sold copies of an eight-page
broadsheet “Impact,’ produced in Bris-
bane. Its editor, an Arts-Law student
named Brian Laver, found it necessary
to give his address as HM Prison,
Boggo Road, where he was then serv-
ing a week for illegally parading,
When the Premier’s Rolls appeared
seven sharp chants of “Go home Kv”
and “We want Ky” mingled. He dis-
appeared swiftly into the hotel. Police
and demonstrators had a brisk session
of pushing each other across the barrier.
The police seized most placards and
darted into the crowd to make arrests,
By the end of the evening 14 were
taken, including a number of regular
arrestees.
Premier Ky appeared at a window
above the crowd and got more cheers
than boos. By then the George Street
trams had started pushing their way
through the people on the roadway
and the police told spectators to move
along. They did so cordially.
Sydney: No View from the Bridge
As soon as the door of the RAAF Viscount opened, Vietnamese students in the
crowd at Sydney Airport began cheering and chanting “One-two-three, we support
Marshal Ky.” The cheers grew louder as Premier Ky and Madame Ky descended
the steps, to be greeted by N.S.W. Premier and Mrs. Askin.
There were gasps of admiration as the
students caught glimpses of Madame
Ky, exquisitely attired in a red floral-
designed ao dai. Shouting, they held
up a red and yellow Vietnamese flag
and two large banners, one in Vietnam-
ese and the other an English transla-
tion: “Vietnamese Students in Sydney
Welcome Premier Ky.”
After Premier and Mrs. Askin had
been introduced to members of the Ky
party, Premier Ky walked past a wait-
ing limousine and went to the wire
fenced enclosure where a crowd of
about 100 were waiting. Greeting first
the 25 Vietnamese students at one end
of the fence, he walked slowly to the
other end.
He smiled and nodded as people held
aloft their signs, “Hooray for Ky,”
“Australia Welcomes Ky,” “God Bless
Ky.” One placard, with a cartoon of
a horned Mr. Calwell, read “Better Ky
Than He.” If there were any anti-Ky
shouts, they were drowned by the hur-
rahs. One man holding an American
flag cried, “Keep your chin up.” The
entire welcome took less than ten min-
utes.
The visitors were whisked away to
the north side of Sydney Harbor, where
they were to be received at Kirribilli
House, and where Mr. Calwell’s forces
were gathering for another protest
march.
In temperatures that climbed to the
nineties, the original 11 a.m. crowd
under the Harbor Bridge numbered ap-
proximately 4000. By the end of this
protest at 3.00 p.m. barely 200 re-
mained—as Bob Gould, the Trotskyite
central organiser of the Sydney anti-
war movement phrased it, these loyal-
ists were “the hard core of the hard
core.” The reasons why the leaders
failed to keep the people through to
the 4.00 p.m. return of Marshal Ky
from his Harbor cruise were:
• A split of leadership between those
who wished to hold a peaceful protest
march in the vicinity of Kirribilli
House, where Ky dined (represented by
the ALP’s Tom Uren and British La-
bor M.P. Anne Kerr) and those who
wished to crowd the barricades near
the House in defiance of police efforts

Mostly, it was a very poor display of
organisational competence. There was
little participation at any stage of the
proceedings by the mass of people pre-
sent, though it was obvious that most
graved some sort of direct involvement,
The cries of Killer Ky, the false
laughter at the anti-American jokes,
the persistent displays of collective per-
secution neuroses, the burning of an
effigy of Ky ( it had a yellow face and
a y e ji ow stripe down its back), the dis-
tribution of anti-Ky petitions—nothing
seemed to evoke any real expression of
violent feeling.
Melbourne: A Personal Triumph
g,OME funny things happened on Air Vice-Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky’s way to
Melbourne on Sunday. Whilst his helicopter was chopping its way from Portsea
up to Melbourne through the sea air, the anti-Ky demonstrators were gathered in
the Botanic Gardens outside Government House. They numbered a couple of
thousands and were encircled by some hundreds of Sunday sightseers, a thin band
of loutish-looking pro-Ky agitators, and a phalanx of TV cameras, newsreel cam-
eras, and pressmen.
First to speak, was Mr. Arthur Cal-
well. His craggy old face as near as it
could be to resplendent in the afternoon
sun, he told us that he “came here to
preach the gospel of divine discontent
. . . we shall overcome and we shall suc-
ceed and we shall persuade the Aus-
tralian people at the next election that
we are right.” Whilst a dozen Viet
Cong flags unfurled in the warm air he
said, “Ky has put heart back into the
Australian Labor Party . . . we knew
that Marshal Ky would not be welcome
in this country and I made the decision
on my own” —a long pause whilst we
all wondered what decision—“to lead
the demonstrations wherever he went.”
Mr. Calwell—one recalled Billy Liar
in Keith Waterhouse’s novel, blasting
away with all guns in ambrosia—then
opened fire against the Australian
people, Ky, and the Press.
Gathering intensity, Calwell pro-
claimed that most dubious of present
left-liberal myths: that guns cannot de-
feat ideas.
I walked around the crowd counting
the dozen or so happy faces of the
Communists I could recognise. At that
stage I was confronted by a young
man from Monash University who an-
nounced himself as the organiser of the
protest meeting. He explained that the
chairman and convener were also from
Monash.
By the time the helicopters arrived
Arthur had finished and the Viet Cong
flags were waving to the rhetoric of a
Mr. Niall Brennan, son of a former
Federal Labor Cabinet Minister, who
was introduced as a “distinguished
Catholic layman.” The crowd forgot
Brennan and turned to the skies, boo-
ing and jeering at the descending Air-
Marshal Ky.
Not long after, the brave Vietnamese
airman and Madame Ky emerged from
vice-regal security in a black Humber,
led by a police van and followed at an
extended trot by three constables moun-
ted on huge greys. Ky was apparently
going to meet the people, but most of
the people, excluding police and the
Press who made up a great portion of
the crowd, booed and waved their fists
at him. Some of the comments I heard
were “butcher,” “killer Ky” (very pop-
ular), and “we want the Viet Cong.”
Ky did not emerge from the Humber,
which turned at the beginning of the
drive which runs through the gardens
up to Government House and headed
back towards the bosom of the vice-
regal residence at a smart canter.
A few minutes later he came calm
and smiling into the Governor’s ball-
room to meet the Press. As an intro-
duction he repeated that he had not
come to Australia for himself person-
ally, but for his people’s cause in South
Vietnam and to clear up “misunder-
standings about himself and his Gov-
ernment.”
The Press questions, as one might
have expected, varied from the search-
ing to the stupid. On the whole, they
were tougher than the questions he
received in Canberra There was a hint
of the strength which lies behind the
soft moustache in his answer to a
question about a possible coup of gen-
erals not attracted by the virtues of
an elected government; he admitted
that there could be dissident groups
in the south still, but added that there
would be no coup. “I will stop them.”
He claimed that he had no knowledge
that the Saigon Press had been cen-
sored in its reports of his visit, and
added that if there was censorship it
was “silly” because his reception in
Australia was so good. In answer to
the question would he stand for the
Presidency of South Vietnam at the
next elections he gave a final and
definite “No.”
Generally the answers were frank
and relevant; a couple of times, either
because his English or his politics were
uncertain, he slid away from a question
like a smart lightweight slipping a
punch. I came away from the Press
conference convinced that his visit to
Australia has been little short of a
personal triumph.

THE MASONS
AND GOD
Concluding two-part report
“'T— ■
By MICHAEL BAUME
Freemasonry is not so much a
secret society as a society with
secrets. There is . nothing secret
about where lodges meet, who are
leaders of the craft, or even who are
its members; its leaders are photo-
graphed in their regalia in the Press
and anyone enthusiastic enough to
stand outside a lodge room could see
who its members were. But it does have
secrets and not simply the secret
words, secret grips, and secret ceremon-
ies that are by now no longer a real
secret at the craft lodge level (even
though higher lodges have managed to
keep their key words to themselves).
What, then, are the secrets that
members swear to keep? “Under no
less a penalty on the violation of any
of them,” as Dewar reports in his book
“The Unlocked Secret,” “than that of
having my throat cut across, my tongue
torn out by the root and buried in the
sand of the sea at low-water mark,” or
“of having my left breast laid open,
my heart torn therefrom, and given to
the ravenous birds of the air or de-
vouring beasts of the fields,” or “of
being severed in two, my bowels burned
to ashes, and those pshes scattered over
the face of the earth,” or, and this is
the real penalty, “of being branded
as a wilfully perjured individual, void
of all moral worth.” For freemasonry
is, above all, h system of morality; a
guide to proper behaviour.
The secrets of freemasonry are not
in its aims and objects, so much as in
the ways of achieving them; the secrets
are not in the words and gestures of
the rituals which make up this “allegory
illustrated by symbols” that is free-
masonry, so much as in what they
mean to a mason.
As the Grand Master’s committee of
inquiry on membership in N.S.W.
recently stated in its report, “In free-
masonry we are not taught anything
that is unique. The same ethical pre-
cepts are part of all religions and most
philosophies.” It said: “Masonry teaches
us all spiritual doctrines and gives to
us a sacred initiation into the pro-
foundest truths of life . . . The primary
function of a masonic lodge is to train
its members to an understanding of the
truths its rituals and its ceremon-
ies are calculated to inculcate, to
develop its members as benevolent men,
to cultivate the social virtues among
men, and to propagate the knowledge
Of the art.”
As the former N.S.W. Grand
Master said last year: “The mission of
freemasonry is the building of the
ideal temple and he is the true mason
who works true to the plan of that
temple. He has to build himself and
thereby contribute to the building of
humanity. How to live is a problem
each of us must solve for himself.”
But Dewar’s view is: “There is in
masonry a great deal that men un-
doubtedly find of value to them in
their attempts to achieve a higher
quality of life, not materially but
spiritually. Freemasonry is also full of
half-truths and the seeds of menace. No
man should join in ignorance.”
It is to avoid the problem of
members joining “in ignorance” that so
disturbs Dewar that the committee
suggested a book be prepared explain-
ing to potential candidates what
masonry is all about. This would add
weight to the assurance already given
initiates that “there is nothing incom-
patible with your civil, moral, or
religious duties” in the vows they will
be required to make.
So the ceremonies and rituals are no
alchemists’ potion converting listeners
immediately into new men blessed with
Americanisation of the craft?
the secrets of life. Some commentators
on freemasonry conclude from this that
there must be something else, some
other, more sinister secret; others, like
Dewar, take the view that it is all
something of a hoax.
The craft’s greatest problems are in
its relations with the Churches, for its
rules are wide enough to allow all
believers in a God (Christian, Jewish,
or other God) to join. The Catholic
Church still is violently opposed to
the craft. Under Canon Law (Canon
2335) those who give their name to
the masonic sect, or other similar sect,
which plots against the Church or
legitimate civil powers, are subject to
excommunication.
Dr. Murray, of the Catholic Infor-
mation Bureau in Sydney, says that
there is no evidence that the masons
have plotted against the Church or
the authorities in Australia in recent
times and he says that some of the
pamphlets still on issue by the Catholic
Truth Society on freemasonry are quite
out of date.
“There is no great pressure to remove
the excommunication provision on mem-
bership of a masonic lodge; it is a
religion with its own beliefs and moral
code, its own superimposed religious
principles, so a Catholic simply could
not belong to both.” Yet, the major
reason for Catholic opposition seems
as much organisational as philosophic.
Sydney Catholic spokesman Dr. L.
Rumble says- that the reason the
Catholic Church condemns the secrecy
of freemasonry is that “ordinary mem-
bers are caught by their mystery-loving
instinct and then are used for policies
of which they know nothing as
masonic influence is used in this direc-
tion or that according to the practical
programs, social and political, of dif-
ferent leaders in different countries.”
He claims that masonic leaders possess
an “uncontrolled and irresponsible
power subject to the scrutiny neither
of the civil society in which they func-
tion nor of any ecclesiastical authorities.
This evasion of all outside supervision
is most dangerous to the welfare of
both Church and State.”
And Monsignor Mcßeavy, in his
pamphlet “Forbidden and Suspect
Societies,” gives more evidence that
what worries the Church is not so much
that subversive plotting takes place but
that the masonic secrecy prevents the
Church from “exercising her legitimate
function of vigilance.” “Moreover . . .
she objects to the naturalistic philosophy
of life which has always been charac-
teristic of masonry in all its forms, and
to its consequent indifferentism in re-
gard to religious creeds.”
The Catholic Church is not the only
one that worries about the masons. In
1958, the Presbyterian Church in Vic-
toria issued a pastoral letter read from
all pulpits warning against substituting
freemasonry for the Christian religion.
The letter said, “The excellence of
the teaching of freemasonry concerning
moral duty and its practice is admitted;
the charitable institutions and hospitals
of freemasonry are universally
acclaimed; members of the craft extol
the friendship and fellowship they have
found in its ranks; the social teachings
in the rituals are of the highest order;
there is no doubt a true mason must
necessarily be a man of fine charac-
ter.”
So while the General Assembly of
the Presbyterian Church did not con-
demn or repudiate freemasonry, it
directed Presbyterian freemasons to
beware “lest they regard freemasonry
as a competitor with their Church for

MASTER-KEYED SYSTEMS
A Master-Keyed System is one in which each
lock has its own individual key, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to. the Master-Key.
A 3.1
a.\
GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock has its own individual key which
operates that lock only and no other, but the
locks are divided into two or more groups.
Each group is subject to its own Master-Key,
which opens all locks in that group, but no
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all locks in
all groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike
groups may also be included in G.M.K. Systems.

their loyalty.” “Contrary to the teach-
ings of freemasonry, some members give
their first allegiance to the demands
of the lodge.”
The Church of England in Australia
does not regard freemasonry as an
issue; it has no single mind on the
subject and supporters and opponents
are prepared to let the matter rest at
present. The matter has been debated
at Convocation in Britain, it has never
been examined here.
Much of the opposition to free-
masonry is quite irrational. Dewar
notes: “There is an emotional need
of many men to find a scapegoat to
blame for failures in the quality of the
national life, or personal or business
careers. The most popular of these
whipping boys have been the Jews and
freemasons.” Anti-masonry has a
lunatic fringe, and a booklet by Father
E. Cahill for the Catholic Truth
Society, first published in 1929 but still
available 30 years later, gives some idea
of it. In it he says: “Limits of space
and other reasons preclude ds from
discussing the deeper and far more
intimate nature of the masonic secret;
how far, namely, the masonic cult is
to be identified with the formal worship
of Satan, the arch enemy of mankind,
and how far Satan physically co-
operated in masonic activity.” He pro-
duces no evidence, and continues:
“Freemasons formally and expressly
associate their sect and religion with
the Phallic worship and the ancient
pagan mysteries and with the Bacchic
rites practised in ancient Egypt and
Greece.”
Father Cahill sees it all as a Jewish-
freemason-socialist plot: “The whole
socialist movement is largely a Jewish
creation. The founders of socialism
Marx, Engels, and Lasalle were
Jews and freemasons.” But, unfortun-
ately for Father Cahill’s thesis, free-
masonry is banned in Communist-
controlled countries (as it is by all dic-
tators).
The English Grand Lodge states:
“Everyone who enters freemasonry is,
at the outset, strictly forbidden to
countenance any act which may have
a tendency to subvert the peace and
good order of society; he must pay
due obedience to the law of any State
in which he resides or which may afford
him protection, and he must never be
remiss in the allegiance due to the
sovereign of his native land. Neither
in lodge nor at any time in his capacity
as freemason is he permitted to discuss
or advance his views on theological or
political questions.”
This English Grand Lodge statement
said: “It cannot be too strongly
asserted that masonry is neither a re-
ligion nor a substitute for religion.
Masonry seeks to inculcate in its mem-
bers a standard of conduct and be-
haviour which it believes to be accept-
able to all creeds, but studiously
refrains from intervening in the field
of dogma or theology. Masonry is,
therefore, not a competitor with re-
ligion, though in the sphere of human
conduct it may be hoped that its
teaching will be complementary to that
of religion. The stress laid on the
mason’s duty toward a supreme being
should be sufficient evidence to all but
the wilfully prejudiced that masonry
is an upholder of religion, since it both
requires a man to have some form of
religious belief before hd can join and
to go on practising it.”
Masons who are found guilty of
criminal offences are liable to expul-
sion, and even those who are involved
in unsavory court actions (for instance,
in divorce) may be obliged to stand
down from any masonic office they
hold. Last year more than 800 masons
were “struck off” for various reasons
in N.S.W. alone.
rpHE struggle to keep masonry faithful
to its tradition is seen in the limit
set by British masonry on recognising
overseas organisations, where some
masons have, as Dewar says, “found in
the secrecy surrounding the lodges the
privacy essential for conspiracies against
Church and State.” And two of the
three French Grand Lodges are
“banned” by British masons because of
their political activities. M. Mitterand,
who leads the new Left-wing alliance in
the National Assembly, is Grand Master
of one of these banned lodges.
This secrecy probably helped such
masonic liberators as Simon Bolivar,
Garibaldi, Kossuth, La Fayette, Maz-
zini, Paul Revere, and George Wash-
ington to build up their organisations.
It is not in the British tradition. Other
famous less revolutionary masons were
Robert Burns, Goethe, Haydn, Mozart,
Kipling, Kitchener, Cecil Rhodes, Sir
Walter Scott, Sibelius, Voltaire, Frank-
lin, Irving Berlin, Buffalo Bill, Henry
Ford, and Will Rogers.
But freemasonry is, in a world sense,
becoming less “British.” The craft has
a world membership of about six mil-
lion, with about four million, or two-
thirds of members, in the U.S., 250,000
in Canada, 50,000 in Latin America,
375,000 in Australasia, 10,500 in the
Philippines, 550,000 in England and
Wales, 400,000 in Scotland, 47,000 in
Ireland, and 65,000 in Continental
Europe, according to the U.S. Fraternal
Monitor.
In Australia, as in Britain, no one
advertises his membership of the craft;
in the U.S., masons wear insignia and
rings and advertise generally that they
are members of the movement and are
proud of it. And at the 1964 World
Fair at New York, a Masonic Centre
with historical documents on show had
as its slogan: “Brotherhood is our most
important product.”
Which way will freemasonry go in
Australia? Will the British or the
American pattern be the guide for the
future? It is a problem that the craft
has to face very seriously.
The recent report into membership
did not propose any real swing toward
the American approach, although it
certainly suggested a change from the
old retiring ways of the British
tradition. It argued: “We must have the
aims and objects of our great craft out-
lined and publicised to the entire world.
The aims and objects of the craft, in
line with present-day language and
present-day thinking, should be given
to every mason and impressed upon
him in such a way that he can pass
them on to ‘outsiders.’
“We are also of the opinion that
one of the main reasons for a lessen-
ing of applications for membership of
the craft is that the members of the
craft and its governing body are fail-
ing to ‘convince mankind of the good-
ness of the order.’ We have a fear
that we may be concentrating to too-
great an extent on benevolence and
charity directed to our own brethren
and their dependants to the exclusion of
a much wider application of these great
masonic attributes.”
So now, instead of the community
as a whole worrying nervously about
the masons, the masons are worried
about their relations with the com-
munity. The craft is at the crossroads..
Antic Semantics at ANZAAS
Melbourne University’s drab and crowded campus provided a corroboree ground
last week for an estimated 3000 scientists from Australia, New Zealand, and else-
where who had gathered under the banner of ANZAAS to advance knowledge and
promote “a spirit of co-operation between scientific workers and scholars and
those in sympathy with science and scholarship generally.”
Lord Casey, in opening the Congress,
exhorted the scientists to keep the
general sympathisers well in mind: “I
wish you would devote more time and
thought to speaking and writing in terms
the average, educated individual can
readily understand,” he said. He claimed
there was a dire shortage of engineers
and agricultural scientists, but we were
unlikely to get more young people join-
ing these vital professions unless the
scientists took care to describe the signi-
ficance of their work in terms that
ordinary parents could appreciate.
Generally, his advice fell among
thorns. Minutes later the layman suffi-
ciently interested to go on into the
sessions found himself listening to such
words as: “In this paper an attempt is-
made to combine, empirically, the esti-
mation of product transformation sur-
faces with more conventional methods
of linear supply analysis. This synthetic
approach is used to fit simultaneously
a system of six aggregate supply func-
tions.” These words are taken not from
a talk describing some aspect of nuclear'
physics but from a paper on agricul-

demonstrated that this nation, under
heaven’s frown, must urgently recon-
struct! its entire economy and begin
giving the world the food it so des-
perately needs. Its crucial message
appeared to be that we must spring
off our seats on the wool pack. Wool
is down and out. Dairy products, too.
This land must prepare for growing
cereals and raising beef and mutton.
But then the paper could have been
arguing a contrary need. The words
remain utterly unintelligible except, pre-
sumably, to economists.
Fortunately, not all the papers were
presented in inscrutable language. Con-
sequently, it can be reported with some
confidence that the scientists were pre-
occupied with the woes of this world
and with the particularly wretched
state of the social, economic, and phy-
sical order of this country. Many
speakers were very concerned about
the famine soon to overtake the earth.
Others showed that life in suburbia
is crushingly destructive to the human
spirit, that provision for education at
all levels is scandalously inadequate,
that we more than any of the Western
nations have discounted the distaff side
of our people’s intellectual potential,
that we are prodigally neglectful of
our rich inheritance of coal, that there
is still no prospect of our being able
to purify large volumes of salt or brack-
ish water economically, that one in
every 16 of Melbourne’s people struggle
for existence below the “poverty line,”
that little can be done about the road
toll because most people do not even
see what is about to hit them.
so the jeremiad went on all week
with scarcely a ray of relief. Per-
haps people fearful of death by cancer
can take heart. Two speakers described
findings on mice which indicated that
within the foreseeable future we will
have developed remedies for stomach,
bowel, and ovarian cancer at least.
Professor E. A. Underwood, in the
course of his Farrer Memorial Oration,
postulated that the most encouraging
development of all was that “The
Roman Catholic Church is showing
hopeful signs of modifying its former
intransigent attitude to the use of con-
traceptive devices by its members.” He
feels that if the Pope blesses the pill
and the coil a major step toward over-
coming the world’s food crisis will have
been taken, particularly in Latin
America, where the population is
presently exploding most violently.
(South Americans are popularly be-
lieved to be ardent followers of Rome.)
The disinclination of enough young
people to enter science and engineering
may not be entirely attributable to the
language that scientists choose. Perhaps
the gloomy matters that engross them
are partly responsible. Young people
these days tend to pursue joy.
LETTERS
Jesuits in Australia
Sir,
Charles Davis was not a Jesuit (B.
Jan. 14) but a Diocesan priest who, for
the past year, has been Professor of
Dogma at Heythrop, formerly the
Jesuit Seminary for England, now raised
to a Papal Seminary catering for all
comers, but still directed and for the
most part staffed by Jesuits. More
important: two substantial omissions
detract from Brian Buckley’s run-down
on Australian Jesuits.
First, the Australian Province has
undertaken more work, and more varied
work, than any other Jesuit Province
in the world, given the number of men
at their disposal. Overseas Jesuits
admire the sheer volume of work done
by the small group of Australian Jesuits,
who became a Province only in 1950.
There are 194 Jesuits here, and they
have to maintain five seminaries, ten
schools, eight parishes, all but two of
Australia’s Catholic University Col-
leges, with another venture on the
tertiary level just announced for Port
Moresby, a growing mission in India,
and a wide range of other specialised
works. In America there are 7000
Jesuits, so it is not surprising that they
can produce a Courtney Murray once
in a while. If the Jesuits are open to
criticism in this country it is because
they have undertaken more than they
would really like with the limited
resources they have.
The second omission concerns the
real achievements of Jesuits in the past.
So much in Australian Catholicism that
is solid, answers real needs, and shows
promise, hither came from Jesuit
inspiration or benefited from Jesuit
assistance somewhere along the line. An
outstanding example is Father William
Hackett, S.J., founder of Melbourne’s
Catholic Library, the best in the
country, and of the Institute of Social
Order, Kew, which now publishes two
leading Catholic periodicals for the
layman who wishes to be effective as a
Catholic in his community “Twen-
tieth-Century” and “Social Survey.”
Mr. Buckley traces certain undis-
tinguished features of Australian Jesuits
to their Irish background. For too long
now the Irish have been blamed for
what could be found in Dutch, French,
Italian, or almost any other variety of
Catholicism puritanism, legalistic
mentality, or sentimentalism in religion.
It is time somebody protested. It is
fruitless and untrue to lay the ills of
English-speaking Catholicism at tfie
Irishman’s door.

Slessor’s Poetry
Sir,
The main point I wished to make
in my review (8., Dec. 17) was I felt
that Mr. Semmler’s dismissal of the
much-discussed aspects of Slessor’s writ-
ing (the Harbor as theme and image,
and his decision to stop writing whilst
apparently at the peak of his career)
was altogether too glib. “His study,
however, is not lacking in nice points
of observation, and I think that when
discussing the early works he illumi-
nates their essential dualities par-
ticularly well. Mr. Semmler is neatly
succinct in his summing up of the
‘Vision’ period; he also makes the
pertinent observation (and the sort of
observation necessary to a modern
understanding of early Slessor) that
‘Slessor in his early verse turned all this
into something arrestingly real; I sug-
gest that its impact on the antipodally
removed readers of the 1920 s was as
unexpected, jarring, and yet stimulat-
ing as Eliot’s early poetry elsewhere.’
In his final summary, also, I think Mr.
Semmler does perhaps more justice to
the positive achievements of Slessor’s
work than Judith Wright seems pre-
pared to concede. And I think it is
important in any study of Slessor to
point out that ‘above all there is a
continuing irony, a quality which above
most others has distinguished modern
Australian poetry.’ So that, although:
Judith Wright’s study is almost' cer-
tainly the definitive one, in depth, Mr.
Semmler’s monograph should be read
for a general no-nonsense plain-man’s
approach.”

The Anti-Star System
Sir,
We dips our lids to Charles Higham
for his article “The Anti-Star System.”
As Australian musical-comedy per-
formers who lived with the system and
left it for a more “professional” pro-
fession, we found Higham’s article very
penetrating. Most difficult for us tc>
understand was the statement attributed
to J.C.W.’s Sydney Irving .that “The
Sentimental Bloke” flopped in New
Zealand because “they 'just didn’t
understand it at all across the Tasman.”
We know for a fact that Williamson’s
had decided to cut short “The Bloke’s”
New Zealand tour before the show
reached Auckland, where, in our
opinion, it should have opened. From
behind the footlights the reaction to
“The Bloke” by Kiwi audiences was
no more of a change than playing in-
terstate within Australia.
Australian theatre managements will
continue to subscribe to the “anti-star
system” while their spokesmen can give
lame theatrical excuses for decisions
they make for reasons best known to
themselves.

Talking to the Hills
A FRIEND of ours has recently bought
a house in Sydney’s famed old Surry
Hills. He bought the place because it
was cheap and convenient he can
walk to work and not with spme
visionary idea of working single-handed
to bring Surry Hills up to the fashion-
able level of Paddington or Balmain.
However, he has already seen signs of
change. An antique shop has opened
up opposite his house, and the estate
agent firmly referred to the area as
“Upper Campbell Street.”
Festival
CESSNOCK, a town much like many
others in Australia, is in the Hunter
Valley, 141 miles from Sydney, and
has a population of about 15,000. A
generation ago Cessnock was on many
people’s lips, usually accompanied by
hearty curses, as coalminers’ strike fol-
lowed strike, and blackout followed
blackout.
Ten years ago mines in the district
began to close. Cessnock was deter-
mined not to become a ghost-town, al-
though for some time if was a dormi-
tory suburb of Newcastle with workers
travelling 30 or 40 miles each day to
the larger centre. But Cessnock estab-
lished its own small industries and soon
an aluminium smelting works at Kurri,
six miles away, will bring jobs closer
to hand.
In the exultation of rebirth, Cess-
nock built a new town hall, which con-
“Well, don't just stand there,
negotiate endorsements!”
tains, they say, the grandest grand piano
in Australia. It acquired a new technical
college and a library; in fact, most of
the amenities which, if they do not
make country-town life gay and soph-
isticated, make it remarkably uniform
throughout Australia.
Only one thing Gessnock lacked.
That was the regulation Festival. The
authorities cast about in their minds,
but, apart from paspalum and Pater-
son’s Curse, there was scarcely a flower
which had not been already plucked by
some other town.
For some time, it seems, the minds
of the authorities dwelt on their belief
that Cessnock produces the best gas-
coal in the world. However, gas-coal
was discarded as being, in view of the
closed mines, representative of Cess-
nock’s past rather than its future.
Then word came that McWilliams,
the wine people at nearby Pokolbin,
were organising a vintage car rally.
Why not have a vintage festival?
Hunter Valley table wines were famous,
if not throughout the world, at least
throughout Australia; so famous that,
according to the classic canard,
thousands of gallons of wine produced
elsewhere are bottled with the magic
words “Product of the Hunter Valley”
on the label. Why not have a vintage
festival, indeed? And as Cessnock is
famous for gas-coal and the Hunter
Valley for wine, why not call it the
Greater Cessnock Vintage Festival?
So was born a wonderful idea, and,
one might add, utter confusion. We
made an attempt, perhaps not
altogether successful, to resolve our
confusion in the matter during a visit
to the district last week in the company
of the indefatigable Cellarmaster of
THE BULLETIN.
The third Greater Cessnock Vintage
Festival will be held from February 11-
19, we learnt over a glass of beer with
the Mayor of Greater Cessnock, Aider-
man W. Brown, and his Council.
Perhaps as long as the Council drink
beer and the district produces wine,
some confusion will remain. But last
festival (two years ago) was a great
success, with nearly 20,000 people
visiting the wineries, and there seems
no reason why the next shouldn’t be
a vintage one.
The Publishers' Season
THIS IS THE SEASON for English
publishers’ visits: following in the wake
of Hamish Hamilton and Gareth
Powell (who returned a second time
for a whirlwind trip, and whose agents
promise to boost sales of New English
Library here by 300,000 to 1,500,000
this year), William Collins and Richard
Fisher, of Lord Thomson’s new paper-
back list, Sphere Books, are here at
present. Mr. Collins is on his sixth
visit since the war to maintain contact
with his Australian authors, most not-
ably George Johnston, Jon Cleary,
Eleanor Dark, and Lucy Walker.
Although Miss Walker, of Western
Australia, is the least known of these,
she is certainly among the most suc-
cessful. Author of romantic novels with
an outback setting, her work is serial-
ised in English magazines and on radio,
and, according to her publishers,
reaches an audience of four million
devoted women in England alone.
Collins’ biggest coup, although not an
entirely intentional one, was to bring
out Charles Davis’ “God’s Grace in
History” only a few days after its
author made his famous break with the
Catholic Church.
Richard Fisher, intelligent and acute,
was .formerly in paperback publishing
in New York and with McGraw-Hill.
Sphere Books, due to be launched in
the next few weeks, is the latest venture
of Lord Thomson, who recently
•crowned his incredible career by buying
the London “Times.”
Sphere Books, Mr. Fisher told us,
“aims at a very distinctive presenta-
tion,” and he showed an attractively
different range of jackets to prove it.
He plans to engage a “scout” to flush
out new tajent in Australia, and will
break new ground by printing titles
simultaneously here and in England.
In this way he hopes to overcome the
famous “time lag” between reviewing
in England and reviewing in Australia,
as well as the aggravating business of
books getting into the shops from pri-
vate orders by their owners long before
publishers have them in stock them-
selves to send them to reviewers.
Among the titles Mr. Fisher has
acquired for publication in 1967 is
Peter Mathers’ “Trap,” which, he says,
is “exciting and brilliant.” He will be
looking for unpublished manuscripts of
this calibre in the next few months.

Christmas at Acapulco
By DAVID McNICOLL
ONCE you start a love affair with
Mexico, it’s very hard to break.
Like a lovely woman who feels
that perhaps you are starting to take
her for granted, she comes up with
something new, something beguiling and
irresistible, and you realise that you are
just as hooked as ever you were. There
are many countries in the world which
have seduction down to a fine art
but Mexico can make each seduction
seem like the first.
Oldtimers will tell you that Acapulco
has been ruined in the past ten years.
Certainly the town section is becoming
very Miami. New hotels are springing
up on all sides, some pleasant, many
tawdry. Parts of the town are plain
filthy. Inefficient neon blinks over
crummy bars and restaurants, stalls full
of rubbish wait to trap the tourist (I
did, however, warm to one stall pro-
prietor who said, “Look, Senor, best
junk in all Acapulco”). Many of the
new plush hotels are, if I may ba
forgiven, “Hiltonised” that strange,
ice-watered impersonalising of a hotel
which seems to attract some, but which
the discerning wayfarer finds unattrac-
tive.
It’s when you get away from town
that Acapulco starts to look enticing.
The Las Brisas is one of the world’s
unique hotels. It is scattered in a series
of casitas up a hillside from the water’s
edge to the heights 500 or 600 feet up.
The casitas are simple, stone-walled,
marble-floored cabins, with rather short
beds; shower recesses, verandas and
each has its own glistening blue swim-
ming-pool. This sounds fabulous and
is indeed a magnificent idea. You may
swim in salt water at La Concha, the
hotel’s own section of harbor foreshore;
or you may dunk in your own fresh-
water pool. But as the salt water is
about five degrees warmer than the
fresh, the private pools do not cajole as
many people from La Concha as you
might imagine.
For $ll a day, you can hire your
own candy-striped jeep at Las Brisas.
The hotel fills your tanks each morn-
ing, and the jeep is yours to do the
journey up and down the hillside, to
town or on any other adventure your
posterior may feel up to attempting.
The jeeps are very distinctive; as all
people staying at Las Brisas are often
mistakenly considered by the locals
to be in the Rockefeller league, the
jeeps get special assistance from Aca-
pulco’s parking police.
In your casita at Las Brisas stands
a refrigerator crammed with cordials
and fruits, and stacked on it every
conceivable drink you could desire. The
idea is that you drink at will, and in
the morning a smiling boy comes in,
notes what has been consumed, and
replaces it after he has handed the
requisite information to the hotel’s
cashier. Any idea you might have that
the local liquor, such as tequila, might
be cheaper than scotch or bourbon,
is doomed to disappointment. It is
cheaper, but not much. In fact, all
liquor in Mexico is pretty expensive.
The best feature of this hotel is
that tipping is forbidden. Any servant
found to have accepted a tip is fired
out of hand. Instead, a loading is
put on your bill, when you leave, to
cover tips—sl4 if your stay is under
ten days, $3O if you stay 11 to 30 days.
The result is that service is pleasant
and faultless.
How did it happen? I asked Bruno
Pagliai, Merle Oberon’s husband (and
one of Mexico’s biggest wheels).
Although he does not have a direct
interest in Las Brisas, I feel he influ-
enced this policy. Bruno told me he
finds the whole business of tipping
fraught with problems. The rich are
expected to be over-lavish, therefore
tend to restrict tipping. The less
affluent try to impress by over-tipping.
But, he told me, it was an experience
in Maxim’s, the famous Paris restaurant,
which really soured him. Like most
European establishments, Maxim’s
charges “service,” an extra percentage
on the bill. This was originally intended
to cover tipping, but on the Continent
today a handsome tip is expected, even
on top of the bill plus “service.”
Signor Pagliai was eating at Maxim’s
one day when he saw two Americans at
the next table puzzling over the bill.
The man pointed out the “service”
charge, but his diffident wife, looking
round, whispered to her husband that
other lunchers were leaving tips. So
the husband left a tip on the plate
which the waiter had brought back with
the change from the bill. The waiter
glared at the tip, said flatly, “It is not
enough” and moved away. Bruno
Pagliai saw red. He sent for the maitre
d’hotel, told him what had happened,
and said, “See those Americans out as
though they were royalty. This sort
of thing must never happen again in
Maxim’s.” So the Americans were
bowed out with utmost deference, asked
to come again—and one shudders to
think what happened to the hungry
waiter.
What do you do in Acapulco? Well,,
you can sail, water-ski, fish (sailfish,
catch as many as you like, but only
allowed to keep one per boat a
strange sensation, unhooking and
throwing back 1301 b. denizens with
which you have been battling for half
an hour). You can shoot, explore, shop.
Or you can merely flake out in the
sun for hours on end, waking in time
to go to the bullfight if it happens to
be Sunday, or the jai-alai games at
night.
Dressing is the most informal you
will find anywhere. It makes Honolulu
look stuffy. Men in Acapulco wear
slacks, sandals, and open-necked shirts
at night. The girls, however, do get
dossed up quite a bit. In fact, I saw
in Acapulco some of the most fabulous
and carefully calculated casual wear
women have donned. But late at night
when the action starts to quicken at
the Tequila a Go-Go, the overall sar-
torial effect is true tropical informality.
I have an aversion to the term
“jet set,” although I found some
amusement in the Braniff airlines des-
cription of Acapulco as the place “where
the jet set turns off its motors.” But
that is misleading. It may be intended
to mean that the jet set gets there and
settles down for a day or two but
they certainly don’t turn off their
motors. If anything they increase the
revs. I have always regarded myself
as pretty fit. But I hand the palm to
the gyrating go-goers of Acapulco who-
wiggle and bump in the dim and noisy
nightspots until the first streaks of the
early sun come over the hills.
Life takes on a more leisurely and,
in my book, a pleasanter tempo in Aca-
pulco’s private homes. Some of the
villas are quite beautiful lacking
ornate and plush magnificence, but suc-
ceeding in being luxuriously comfortable
and practical. Apart from the villas,
there are many “cottages” a lot on
the hillside near Las Brisas, and ser-
viced by the hotel. Comfortable lean-
tos, with upwards of six bedrooms and
a suitable number of bathrooms. Many
of these “cottages” are rented over the
holiday season at prices which must
give their owners a warm glow. But,
after all, they do throw in the servants.
The most beautiful home in Acapulco
and it is more formal than most
is the pavilion Ghalal where Bruno
and Merle Pagliai spend several months
of the year. Merle Oberon, besides-
being a woman of incredible beauty
and an actress of distinction, is a de-
signer whose ideas have drawn approval
from great experts. When the eminent
architect Juan Sordo Madeleno drew
up designs for Ghalal, Merle, took over
and the finished pavilion is mostly her

ideas the Islamic-Moorish appear-
ance, the arches, the ponds, and the
pools with palms growing in small
islands,, studded in their blue waters.
The hpuse is largely Carrara marble,
imported by Bruno from his native
Italy the brilliant carpets in the
house were designed by Merle and
woven in Mexico.
The pavilion is exotic, but easy to
run. The children’s house is a separate
building in the garden; so is the guest’s
house. There is no dining-room in the
pavilion —meals are taken on the cool
verandas or by the pool.
It was by the pool that Merle held
Christmas dinner. Her guests were
specially instructed to be there at
6 o’clock, and by 6.15 most had arrived.
The guests were a mixture of American,
Italian, Spanish, Mexican, and Aus-
tralian.,, About 30 adults and perhaps
as many children. John Wayne and his
wife, and a quiverful of his youngsters
(trying out burp guns and other missiles
which had been in Christmas stock-
ings) 1 ; Henry and Christina Ford; Peter
Lawfotd; movie directors, fashion ex-
perts (Mrs. Henry Ford had just been
put in the Best Dressed list, and a
famous designer had brought her a
dress to Acapulco to celebrate the occa-
sion).
But, apart from the hostess, the most
arresting woman at Christmas dinner
was Dolores del Rio. Dolores’ looks
are quite incredible. Anyone who knows
her film history will know approxi-
mately how old she is. But she looks
no more than 45—her skin is perfect,
her figure trim, her eyes blaze as they
did at a hundred villains and melt as
they did at a hundred heroes. They
will tell you in Mexico that Dolores,
to keep her beauty, spends a large part
of the day resting. I can only say that
the formula has been a fantastic success.
As the sun was finally split up by
the palm fronds in the garden, and
the lights of the pavilion came on, we
heard singing. Through the gate, and
winding down the garden, came a
crocodile of children. They wore scarlet
and white surplices; the ones in front
carried candles, others tambourines; the
ones behind guitars. As they circled
the pool they sang carols and hymns
in Spanish everything from “Adeste
Fidelis” to “Jingle Bells.” These were
the children from Merle Oberon’s own
orphanage, where they are educated,
and finally apprenticed to a trade, or,
if they show exception ability, sent on
for higher education. The orphanage
is soaking up all Merle’s fortune all
her income, her capital.
The children sang for nearly an hour.
Then came the reward. A pinata was
hung from a tree a sort of huge
papiermache bird. Each child in turn
was blindfolded, then given a long stick
with which to take a whack at the
pinata. With each crack it weakened,
and presents started to tumble out.
When finally a shrewd crack from a
tea-year-old split it in two, the goodies
cascaded to the ground while the red-
robed choristers swooped on them.
Dinner for the grown-ups started
about eight. We lined up for our food
at the buffet, where the chefs carved
the glazed hams and the steaming
turkeys, and the plum puddings. We
ate at sixsome tables round the pool,
to the accompaniment of Chateau
Latour and Pol Roger. The lights of
Acapulco winked across the bay, and
an occasional fishing boat moved up
the channel toward the ocean. From
the tables came a babble of Italian,
Spanish, and English mostly Italian,
Does Acapulco start to pall? I
think it could, for the visitor, after a
fortnight or so. It has the same rather
rock-bound effect of a Greek island,
But it is only a chip shot from Mexico
City, less than an hour by air, and
only seven hours by road. And Aca-
pulco, whether it eventually palls or
not, is merely part of the overall magic
of Mexico, part of the love affair.
Times Past at Lome
By BATMAN
J TNQUESTIONABLY, Portsea is the
watering place with the most tone
in Victoria. After buying one’s
residence in St. George’s Road or
Heyington Place, Toorak, 5.E.2, it is
utterly essential also to have one’s place
at Portsea. Portsea is known as “little
5.E.2.” As an example of this, the
Harold Holts have their place in St.
George’s Road and their summer resi-
dence on the cliff at Portsea.
Well, we gentlemen who water at
Lome, over on the other side, are
jealous of this reputation. We feel we
are at least the S.E.I of watering places,
if not rather superior in real “quality”
to Portsea. After all, we have always
received the very best of the Western
District grazing families.
True, at Portsea you hear an un-
believable purr of Rolls-Royces,
Bentleys, Mercedes, and Rovers, but we
do well here, with the occasional Rolls
and Aston Martin, and even back in
the ’thirties we were awfully proud of
some of our Buicks, Packards, and
Hudsons. Indeed, the Lome pf the
’thirties evokes feelings of vast nos-
talgia for many Victorians. We used
to go down to Erskine House to stay
for three or four weeks.
RECENTLY at the State Library I
made an exciting find, a March 8,
1906, issue of “Table Talk” with a
special illustrated feature on Lome.
“Table Thik,” of course, was our fore-
most society journal and/it led off with
these telling statements: “Lome is
society’s favorite seaside resort in Vic-
toria. Lome’s popularity is permanently
assured because it combines with the
vitalising presence of the ocean, its
ozone and its spacious aspects, the
more reposeful charm of mountain
scenery, and the lighter, crisper breaths
of pure mountain air . . . and white
open beaches receding in sinuous depths
among fern and moss-fringed hills.”
Yes, you don’t get any crisper breaths
or sinuous depths at Portsea.
“Table Talk” reported that in 1906
there were 42 householders, a
Mechanics Institute, a school and fine
library which was open every alter-
nate afternoon and every alternate
evening. From then on the “Table
Talk” man moved further and further
into rapturous prose. “We firmly be-
lieve that Lome is destined to be as
attractive for visitors in the winter as:
in the summer. There are only two
churches, viz., Church of England
and Presbyterian. They have no police-
men, no lodges, no doctors in Lome
not needing such! What more need be
said in favor of this happy place?”
Last week as social correspondent for
THE BULLETIN your man returned
to Lome. Those sinuous depths are still
there but there have been significant
changes. The police are very much in
evidence, there’s a doctor and a hos-
pital and plenty of need for such, but
culturally the place has deteriorated.
There is no library and the best, you
can hope for 'is the latest Harold Rob-
bins paperback at the local newsagent.
The social centre is the Arab coffee
lounge, where you lie on the floor and
listen to folksingers, and at night you
go to the Wild Colonial. Here the
entrance is upstairs through the trap-
door and the place is tastefully decor-
ated with old brass bedsteads, harness,
and mid-Victorian photographs. This
week the Loved Ones have been
performing. Most people go in bare
feet but there’s a sign out, “Decorations
may be worn.”
But you should see the “Grand
Pacific Hotel.” This is the great old
place of Lome. It was built in 1879
and the 1880 issue of “Inns of Austra-
lia” describes it as the “paradise in the
wilderness.”
The Pacific has been taken over by
Jonathan Crawford, a fashion man
of Flinders Lane. He has spent
$120,000. He painted the whole place
white, he has put in a large heated
swimming-pool, but best of all he has
restored the fine old balconies. Most
of the iron-work was destroyed and
replaced with fibro in the 1939 hurri-
cane. Jonathan Crawford had all the
iron re-cast according to the original
pattern. So the old Pacific almost
looks “Grand” again. Inside he has
the Jet Set Bar, the Surfrider Bar, the
Bistro Bar, and the Fisherman’s Bar.
The suites now all have arch names,
like Claude’s Room, Mike’s Room,
Edward’s Room, the Western District,
the Honeymoon, Jack and Jill’s,
and Pa’s, the Playboy’s Room, the Reef,
and the Portsea.
No doubt they were being magnani-
mous in giving Portsea a mention, but
one wonders whether “Table Talk”
would have given it a pass.

the company in 1966 will be harvested in about
1985 to provide wood and wood products.
Since 1950 A.P.M.’s forestry company, A.P.M.
Forests Pty. Ltd., has planted about 48 million
trees on 69,000 acres of tree farms in Victoria,
Queensland and N.S.W. We are continuing to

MARION RAYMOND'S COOK-BOOK
An Expansive Attitude to Picnics
“/~VNE of the pleasantest forms of
entertainment,” declared Mrs.
Isabella Beeton in 1861, “is a
well-arranged picnic, while nothing is
calculated to give greater dissatisfaction
than a badly managed one.
“To have chosen the wrong people
(even one or two who are likely not
to make themselves agreeable), to have
given people the wrong seats in various
vehicles, or to have too many ladies
in the party, are all often fatal errors.
“We say nothing,” she continues, “of
the mistakes made about the luncheon
or dinner, when as is often the case
the ladies provide this, each taking
what she likes, with the result that there
is too much of one thing and too little
of another; plenty of salad and no
dressing; two or three legs of lamb
and no mint sauce; an abundance of
wine and no corkscrews; and suchlike
little incidents.
“Given a happy party of young
people bent on enjoyment, these are
trifles light as air, which serve to in-
crease the fun rather than diminish it.
“But, on the other hand, the party
may not all be young and merry; it
may be very distasteful to some to have
to eat meat without bread, and almost
impossible without salt; while, no cork-
screw being at hand, it will rouse their
indignation to see the necks of the
bottles knocked off, or the corks incom-
pletely picked out with a penknife; and
yet, in the annals of picnics all these
things bread, salt, and corkscrew
have been forgotten.”
Although all this was written more
than a hundred years ago, and we per-
mit ourselves a chuckle here and there,
it still makes good sense even
though Mrs. Beeton’s idea of what to
take does differ considerably from the
average picnic menu of today.
She offered a choice of two different
menus for twenty persons. The first
included 51b. of cold salmon, quarter
of lamb, a large galantine of veal, 3
boiled chickens, a whole ham, 2 pigeon
pies, the accompaniment of various
sauces and dressings, and five different
desserts not forgetting a pound of
cheese for those still peckish.
The cost of this menu and Mrs.
Beeton was very precise about cost
was £4/5/1.
Her second menu, costing only
£3/6/1, was clearly a vastly inferior
kind of snack, the main items of which
were 4 lobsters, 8 pounds of boiled beef,
2 veal pies, 3 roast fowls, 1 cold tongue,
and five lesser desserts, including a gal-
lon of strawberries and 4 pounds of
cherries.
In my book, either of these affairs
would constitute a veritable bush ban-
quet and I’m not even sure that
I would enjoy the preparation of it.
Something, however, that Mrs. Bee-
ton recommended so long ago does
appeal to me; the fact that picnics are
(or can be) something special, and
should be as sumptuous as possible
under the circumstances.
The delightful Italian expression to
dine al fresco has, unfortunately, be-
come debased into meaning an un-
planned, last-minute hotch-potch in-
stead of, as it should, to eat in the
open air.
Not for me, therefore, the pile of
sandwiches hurled together in grease-
proof paper and offered limp and wilt-
ing to a hot and grumpy gathering at
the end of a long drive.
Each, of course, to his taste; if
you’re a fan of the eucalyptus barbecue
and the boiling billy beside the road,
that’s your privilege but not my cup
of tea.
The purpose of the picnic, just like
the dinner party, should have a strong
bearing on what you plan to eat. A
picnic race meeting, for example, calls
for wmething festive.
Iced champagne, to start with in
proper glasses, which are well worth
the trouble of packing. (And while on
this aspect, consign your paper plates
and cups to where they belong pre-
school birthday disasters and invest
in a few nice wooden plates for the
great outdoors.)
Then a few interesting appetisers
while scanning the race card for
promising outsiders—say, caviar. Why
not? The German jars or the Australian
red caviar (actually the roe of sea sal-
mon) aren’t as expensive as that, and
when mixed with finely chopped onion
and a mimosa of hard-boiled egg and
served on freshly cut brown bread it
goes a long way.
Which brings me to what I consider
the vital principle in picnic thinking:
that wherever possible the ingredients
should not be finally prepared at home,
but should be sliced, chopped, dismem-
bered, or mixed on the spot.
This not only ensures the utmost
freshness and crispness but enables you
to take items which have a high soggi-
ness rating: tomatoes, and
watermelons.
After all, you can chop up a fresh
fruit salad in the time it takes your
selection to drop back from the front
to the back of the field.
Green salad, too, should be kept vir-
ginal in a plastic box, on the ice (with
your favorite dressing in a screw-topped
glass jar), to be ravished immediately
before serving.
Chickens should be handed out in
pieces, with large absorbent napkins. But
the cooking of them should be interest-
ing.
Have you tried roasting a couple of
chickens with nothing more than a coat-
ing of butter, and a clove or two of
garlic, a bruised bayleaf, a small onion,
and salt and pepper stuffed inside, and
a final dusting with salt, black pepper,
and tarragon?
Half an hour before removing from
the oven, pour over the juice of one
lemon and one orange. Baste occasion-
ally, and when cooked drain on absor-
bent paper. Lush!
For something different but delect-
able, buy a “chicken fillet” (which is
what your butcher calls a fillet of
veal). Get him to trim the fat and
sinews; it finishes up in a long roll.
Coat well with monosodium gluta-
mate and chopped garlic (lots of it),
then dot with butter and place in a
hot oven (450 deg.). After 10 minutes
baste well, then sprinkle with soy
sauce, and cook for another 10 minutes.
Allow to cool before sprinkling with
chopped parsley and wrapping in foil
and refrigerating for the journey.
This type of fillet weighs about two
pounds, and should be enough for six
to eight people. (The meat should be
pink in the middle, slices beautifully,
and tastes like fillet of beef at less
cost.)
With it serve potato salad, which is,
incidentally, one thing that improves
by being made before you leave home.
But add a taste of curry powder to
the mayonnaise before you mix it with
the sliced boiled potatoes (do this
while they are still quite warm), and
add chopped spring onions and quarters
of hardboiled eggs.
Picnics, of course, sometimes just
happen; on these occasions, do every-
thing to avoid sandwiches, per se.
Rush out and get hold of a few
french loaves. Behead them, in keep-
ing with their tradition, but keep the
tops of the loaves intact.
Remove the fluffy part of the bread,
line with butter, and fill the shells with
anything and everything your fridge
contains. It’s amazing what you can get
away with: any cold meat goes with
any salad or vegetable, spiced up with
chutney; any cold or canned fish can
be mashed with lemon juice, mayon-
naise, chopped spring onions, and
capers; cream cheese can be freshened
up with ordinary cream, chopped chives
or green capsicums, and topped with
slices of hardboiled eggs.
Replace the buttered lids of the
loaves and wrap in foil. Cut into
halves or thirds to serve.
One final plea: commandeer the
iceboxes for the food, even if it means
forcing your escort to stuff the cham-
pagne, wine, and beer into the boot
with bags of ice.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Mike Pearce Talks
to Garry Shead
THE first thing in film-making is to
entertain. Take this business of
what you’re going to say in films
if it’s not entertaining, it’s going to
be boring, if it’s boring, people aren’t
going to look at it. Therefore, you
might as well stay at home or just
make home-movies.
I feel that technically in the past year
I’ve learnt a lot. In actual understand-
ing and thinking I’ve learnt next to
nothing, because you’re always repeat-
ing what you’ve done before. This is
what everybody in Australia does, re-
peats year in and year out. They call
this experience. But I think that all
these people who are making films here
are genuine; whether they’re good or
not remains to be seen. I think I’m
genuine; whether I’m good enough re-
mains to be seen.
Films could be made in Australia on
16mm., a cheap medium. If they spent
the same money on actors and scripts
that they do on making documentaries,
Intertel and all that a dozen inter-
views, a good opening shot, super titles,
captions at the end, a few bits of
swinging music, and, boy, you’ve got
another documentary they could
make films which would make money.
The films could be enlarged to 35mm.
and then be sold overseas.
Art Dealers and Art Dilemmas
By BARBARA BLACKMAN
THE past seven years has seen the
rise of the dealer in Australian
art, a rise in prices for works of
art, a rise in the status of the artist,
and a rise in public awareness of art.
At this stage of maturity the dealers
face a certain dilemma. They have
proceeded along the European line of
endeavoring to “stable” artists and the
system has failed. Something new and
more appropriate to the particular
situation of the Australian artist must
now be worked out in its stead. Mr.
Elwyn Lynn has suggested that the
next step should be the formation of
an art dealers’ association. There are
some other aspects worth looking into.
“Stabling” is a system whereby cer-
tain artists are committed to showing
with certain galleries or chains of gal-
leries which undertake to hold exhibi-
tions of their work, and to look after
the artist’s interests and publicity;
sometimes a legal contract is involved,
sometimes, even, the artist is on a paid
retainer. This works in Europe, where
the relation between artist and public
is less direct and where the artist may
live far from the city where his gallery
operates, and, moreover, where the one-
man show is the generally accepted
form of exhibition. Australia in the
20th-century, fortunately for its art, as
with Renaissance Italy, has developed
through a history of city-states. This
presents the artist with a multilateral
demand for his work within his own
country. In Great Britain it is the
reverse; there is only London. Cities
suc h as Manchester, Birmingham, and
Bristol have no thriving commercial gal-
lenes. There, to be seen seriously, the
artist must and does go to London.
Here, not only do Sydney and Mel-
bourne compete with each other in
t h e ran g e and splendor of their many
galleries, but Perth and Brisbane have
gac j 1 a ’ ga p er y astonishing in their
elegance and influence for cities of their
size -yyhen all these galleries rival to
procure single shows of new work, then
potentially there is a greater demand
for a good artist’s work than he can
supply.
.
There is, however, the reverse side to
penny. The artist who goes to
Lond P n on doorst % f the
whole E ean t He is also on the
threshold of a wide arc of the present
as he cndses roU nd the current galleries
where painters from Europe, America,
and elsewhere show their works. The
Australian artist must look to his
fellow artist to find the challenge of
what is being newly produced. This has
built up a peculiar interdependence be-
tween Australian painters, one that is
as respectful as it is competitive. The
painters need each other, living as they
do in their own foreground of history.
They do not need and do not tolerate
the dealers as father-figures among
them, when, as brothers, they can work
it out for themselves.
Thus, on the one hand, the galleries
have to mount more shows per year
than the availability of good artists can
provide, and on the other, the artist
can take sights from each other rather
than take cover from the galleries. This
dealer or that might proclaim that he
has exclusive rights to the works of
such-and-such an artist, but he does it
at the risk of embarrassment, for the
artists see no such bond; one artist
will show at this gallery one year and
another the next or give his work to
several galleries in the one city in the
same year.
Now that the Sydney versus Mel-
bourne controversy of the ’fifties and
that other attendant one, the abstract
versus figurative, have died down, there-
is left in its wake awful areas of ignor-
ance from city to city about particular
painters’ works. One need only think of
how little Arthur Boyd has shown in
Sydney considering the stature and
abundance of his work, or that Fred
Williams and Len French have been
seen very little in Brisbane. Desperate
to achieve this “stabling,” the dealers
have made interstate connections, but
they have either made the wrong con-
nections or they have made them too

late. One course seems clearly there for
dealers to take, and indeed some moves
have been made in this direction al-
ready. This is for the documented
group exhibition, arranged by a par-
ticular gallery, which then seeks the
interest of the appropriate artists. Last
year Gallery “A” presented the Nude
Exhibition, which travelled to Mel-
bourne, and Barry Stern is shortly to
hold one devoted to Texture Painting.
Komon’s Christmas exhibition and
Laurie Thomas’ Warana Festival “Art
from Queensland” were summary
shows of major works reseen. Such
survey-shows, retrospective, or theme
exhibitions, well documented, engaged
to travel interstate, attract the best from
the artist and are worthy of the most
attentive viewing from the public.
There may be room for a new figure
on the stage the entrepreneur or
middleman between the dealer and the
artist —scholar, critic, patron or who-so-
be who will wish to make a statement
about art and to do so by arranging an
exhibition about a theme. (The three
Myer Commissions in Brisbane have
been of this order.) It would be he who
would, having thought out an idea,
talk with and co-opt the work of the
artist and then, on the other hand, look
about to see which of the available
galleries will suit or be willing to stage
his show.
By standards anywhere in the world,
Australia has good artists and good
galleries. They have all fought and all
won the Space Race; almost all have
enlarged, extended or moved to larger
premises since inception. But the
“stabling” has misfired. It would be a
sad thing for Australian art if the calen-
dar top for the New Year showed an
array of dealers all with their own
noses cut off waving to a gallery of
Australian painters all rowing off in the
same boat for those other shores.
ART
Looking Back
Dickerson. Blaxland Gallery, Sydney.
THE purpose of the exhibition at
Farmer’s Blaxland Gallery of Bob
Dickerson’s 27 works, all emphatic
images of people who don’t feel com-
pelled to smile when the Dickerson
brush is about its stern recording, is
elusive. Though it contains paintings
from 1947 to 1966, it is by no means a
retrospective, for most of the works
come from the ’sixties; the latest works
are not linked by some comprehensive
theme or attitude that you would find
in a show by Albert Tucker, Sid Nolan,
Charles Blackman, or John Perceval,
with whom Dickerson’s disposition has
been linked, often most tenuously. But,
then, Dickerson, despite erroneous
speculations in the ’fifties that he had
something of the socialist realism of
Ben Shahn, has never been a man with
a program or a manifesto. He simply
records images of rural and urban
isolation, of unheroic endurance, of
people cautiously resisting their environ-
ment, but never revolting against or
defying it.
This is why his large painting of
“Journalists Drinking” their heads
and hands emerge, floating from a
background awash with creme-de-
menthe and brandy and lime lacks
the usual pressure of those eternal walls
and the endless greens' of the almost
deserted parks, for he is best when the
sharp comers of streets and houses
pierce the souls of his waifs, bewildered
families, and sagging, old, grey-faced
men or when, as in “Winter Sun,” the
tree’s foliage disperses like an atom-
bomb cloud and men take their clear
displeasure in the park.
When the background, as in too many
of his recent paintings, becomes a sweet,
pinkish set of powder-puffs or palpita-
ting romantic reds and blues, he loses
the sense of pressure; that he or his
brush knows what has been lost is indi-
cated by the way jawbones, eyes, eye-
brows, and cheekbones are now over-
emphasised, and, because this has be-
come a device to give some tough con-
tours to paintings that were once tense
with them, they become hackneyed and
repetitious. Not all of them, of course,
because, though Dickerson has tended
to theatrical anguish and platitudinous
sentimentality especially in his draw-
ings, which are not shown here he is
capable of some fine, honestly unequivo-
cal works like “The Park,” “Street
Corner,” where three pink-grey-faced
people are hemmed in by walls and
pavements, “Portrait of Lance,” and
“Boy and Walls,” where the chimneys,
dark windows and doors, repeated with
a primitive’s obsessiveness, are arrayed
against the boy whose hands are raised
in supplication.
The human figure in painting best
embodies the emotions when certain of
its realistic features are presented with
startling and revelatory realism and
Dickerson has let painterly qualities
veil the clarity of his vision. Study, for
example, the beautiful, still ease of
“Girl With Melons,” done in 1947,
where the shapes in subdued colors
quietly nudge one another and a corner
is enlivened by a sour green and
yallow slab, or that remarkable work
“Woman on the Beach,” from 1957, one
of those subjects, just this side of the
horrific, that used to upset Sydneysiders.
The sea is a green triangle, as harsh and
sudden as anything in a 1966 hard-edge
abstraction; the rest is an implacably
orange beach on which lies, with a
tendency to dissolve into the orange
sand, a lumpy, whitish-cream woman,
her features suggested with a subtle
delicacy, now rarely found in Dicker-
son, and here and there at neck or
hand a few unobtrusive, tense curves
that give the whole mass a surprising
vitality and relate it to the severity
of beach and sea in a way one would
like to see in more recent works.
Dickerson painted, it seems, too many
undoubted successes in the ‘fifties
“Tired Man,” “The Resurrection,”
“Family Stroll,” and “The Tout”
often appreciated more in retrospect
than when they were done, and now
his failures are being too readily noted;
it’s happening with other artists, too r
and one hears of preferences for Drys-
dale’s 1941-45 period, for ; Nolan’s
1946-47 Kellys, and Arthur Boyd’s
thickly wooded creeks and Half-caste
Bride series, as though a malaise was
crippling those artists whose fame was
established in or by the ’fifties. They
are far from crippled but their own
pasts do deal them sharp blows
occasionally.

yet as a whole it is no more than a
conglomeration of various styles which
simply do not mix.
The “Semiramide” now available on
disc is as good a performance as is
ever likely to be heard. The faults of
trite passages following the most bril-
liant pages, of a Greek tragedy involv-
ing a mother-son love affair set to
tunes made popular on bandstands, of
impossible vocal acrobatics interpolated
at will without rhyme or reason, all of
these become unimportant in the light
of the work’s virtues. We must thank
Richard Bonynge for reducing Rossini’s
mish-mash to sensible proportions.
The performance is by what can only
be described as the Sutherland Opera
Company. There are many advantages
in using the same artists to support
Miss Sutherland again and again, and
in the aggregate they outweigh the
disadvantages. In this case there is
only one failure: Joseph Rouleau has
deteriorated sadly and his work here
is rough and unready. But to bring
the balance heavily on the credit side
there is a tenor, John Serge, who could
be a major discovery. Of Italian
parentage, English domicile, and
carrying an Australian passport, he dis-
plays a fine, flexible voice which
actually manages to fit in all the notes
of the impossible and grateless music
Rossini gave to the minor character of
Idreno.
But “Semiramide” stands and, more
often, falls with its two principals.
While Joan Sutherland does her best
work ever in this recording—no idle
claim, I assure you—she is fully
equalled by Marilyn Horne as the
travesti Arsace. Two performances of
this calibre in one opera make this set
an absolute essential in any collection
of serious singing on disc.

The Marvellous Moppets
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The Child Stars. Norman Z. Jierold.
Macmillan. $3.85.
OUT of the glare of the limelight
they had learned their craft and
gone on ... It is to those child-
ren who stood in that glare, the child
stars of today and yesterday, those re- .
membered and those forgotten, that
this book is devoted and dedicated.”
With these ringing phrases, Norman
Z. Jierold, former editor of the late
lamented “Theatre Arts” magazine, sets
the tone of “The Child Stars,” a coolly
cynical and deadpan account of the
careers of those children who, during
the ’thirties and ’forties, became inter-
nationally famous through their Holly-
wood films. Thomas Mann paid court
to Shirley Temple, and went away with
a Temple badge to commemorate the
occasion; Jackie Coogan was given a
private audience by the Pope and Mus-
solini, and made a “one boy’s Children’s
Crusade” to raise money for the poor
of the Near East; Baby Leßoy was al-
ready a world celebrity at the age of
eight months, and in eclipse at the age
of five. Babies, in fact, were so superbly
Box Office that Baby Peggy, Baby Jane
(recently commemorated in a wonder-
ful film with Bette Davis and Joan
Crawford), and Baby Snooks could lisp
and wink their way into king-sized
fortunes overnight. Many, indeed, as
Mr. Jierold wittily indicates in his
deadpan style, seemed more than a little
aware of their own charms, and knew
all too well how to use them from the
moment they discovered the world out-
side the cradle.
Of his stories, that of Jackie Coogan
is the most spectacular and bizarre, a
ready-made subject for a latter-day
Nathanael West. His enormous fortune,
running into several million dollars,
earned after his discovery at the age
of five by Chaplin for the title role in
“The Kid,” was largely appropriated by
his mother and father-in-law, the Arthur
Bernsteins, and in 1938 a sensational
trial kept America in a fever of excite-
ment. The Kid was, contrary to the
golden myths of Hollywood, hell-bent
on getting his fortune back from his
elders. Stepfather Bernstein, it emerged,
was spending money on the races and
living in luxury with four servants and
two Rolls-Ro/ces while Jackie was liv-
ing in comparative discomfort, unable
to offer his fiancee (Betty Grable no
lgss) insufficient to enable her to live
in the style to which she was accus-
tomed. Bernstein was tough to handle:
“Lawyers tell his mother and me that
every dollar a kid earns before he is
21 years old belongs to his parents.” In
the end, Coogan was forced to share
the spoils almost equally with the man
who, while Jackie was placing one-
dollar bets beside the track at one race-
course, had been seen by Jackie ming-
ling opulently with the rich people in
the enclosed section.
This case wrote the sordid finis to
a career that had begun more spectacu-
larly than that of any other child star.
Travelling to England on the largest
ship afloat, the German Leviathan,
Jackie was insured for 250,000 dollars
American and his fans in Europe
greeted him more ecstatically than
royalty. At Waterloo Station, scores of
thousands of hysterical women and
children mobbed the nine-year-old boy,
who blew kisses to his admirers from
Shirley Temple
a car as he wound through crowds
packed six-deep along the pavements
to the Savoy; later, he had to be
forcibly extracted from the mob at the
Changing of the Guard and carried
shoulder-high into Whitehall. At the
League of Nations, in Geneva, the
Secretary-General, Sir Eric Drummond,
received Jackie; Pope Pius XI pre-
sented him with a silver medal bear-
ing the papal arms and asked him
to help an orphanage in Athens, where-
upon the boy cabled to America for
funds: “I thought it a nice thing
to help the orphanage, so I cabled
to have some food shipped to the
orphanage,” he said redundantly but
generously later. Mr. Jierold adds a
characteristic footnote: “Not surpris-
ingly, this led the Supreme Pontiff to
pat his visitor gratefully on the cheek.”
Later, Mussolini presented Jackie with
his photograph and inscribed on it the
words: “To the little great one.” It was
a far cry from meetings with Pope and
dictator, from crowds at Waterloo
Station, and the famous image of the
bright little boy with cloth cap set
sideways on his head, to the gross
comedian of later years, the latest, most
ignominious appearance of all as
Uncle Fester of “The Addams Family,”
huge, bald as an egg, with a face as
white and plump as a wind-filled sail.
For Baby Leßoy, life was smoother,
although he was subjected to a whole
series of Pavlovian experiments to make
him express grief, fear, or joy. Apples
and oranges, rattles and balloons,
forcible blowings of his nose were used
to make the John Barrymore of baby-
dom laugh or weep. Mae West cheered
him considerably by naming him one
of the 12 most eligible bachelors in
Hollywood; W. C. Fields, fearing (cor-
rectly) that the baby was stealing his
thunder in a comedy, laced his milk
with gin. Gloria Swanson and Carole
Lombard refused to co-star with the
one male in Hollywood against whom
their stellar talents had no chance.
Finally, Fields kicked him six feet
across the floor. When last heard of
he was a 32-year-old lifeguard in Cali-
fornia. Judy Garland’s story is more
familiar: years in the M-G-M salt-
mines, a studio with an army of
which checktu on every detail of a
star’s private life, a studio boss—Louis
B. Mayer—who ordered her luncheons
of chicken soup and nothing else. Then
psychiatry, breakdowns, slashed wrists,
disastrous marriages, and the fatal Aus-
tralian tour (some facts of which Mr.
Jierold has unhappily mangled): this
was the classic Hollywood story of a
raw, exposed talent chewfed up in a
chromium-plated mincing machine.
Freddie Bartholomew’s story wasr
rather like Jackie Coogan’s: this
angelic poppet, mop-haired and liquid-
eyed, with an impeccably genteel British
accent, also had to fight for years to
recover his fortune from his Aunt Cissie
whose great stone face flanks his in
a memorable photograph in this
volume and his grandparents, while
his own parents also struggled over his
millions. Cissie had first whisked him
to Hollywood and fame, and had some-
how managed to get legal guardian-
ship of him; the legal battle went on
and on, most of it paid for by Freddie
himself. Finally, like Coogan before
him, he was forced to divide the loot
of a decade with his clan. Besides this
tale of woe Freddie Bartholomew
is now, happily, a successful Madison
Avenue executive the story of Deanna
Durbin, discovered overnight and
whisked to the utmost heights by Joe
Pasternak, at Universal, retiring at the
height of her career to a happy retire-
ment with her husband in France
reads like the tale of Lucky Cinders.
Of all the child stars, the most
accomplished and knowingly winning
was Shirley Temple, who recently

flounced out of the San Francisco Film
Festival because of Mai Zetterling’s
“Night Games,” thus preserving intact
a Hollywood myth of sweetness and
light. Although a curious gerontophilia
ran through her films —she was dangled
rather suspiciously on the knees of a
whole succession of ancients, all of
whom she converted from skinflint cur-
mudgeonliness to charm and niceness—
her films were for the most part Whiter
Than White. Winking, pursing her lips
and sucking in her cheeks to emphasise
those world-famous dimples, this smart
little twinkletoes became the most suc-
cessful star in Hollywood, even ahead
of Clark Gable; the number of girls
called Shirley born between 1933 and
1934 must be prodigious. Her films were
beautifully made: “The Little Prin-
cess,” a story of a Polly Cinders in
London during the Boer War, was the
perfect children’s film, and her “Young
People” was an enchanting minor musi-
cal. Fox lavished the bankroll on her,
with sets by the great Richard Day,
photography by the famous Arthur
Miller, and supporting casts of the best
character actors in America. Her money
carefully invested for her by her parents,
she grew into the graceful, charming
woman who introduced “The Shirley
Temple Story Book” on Television:
here at last, among all the tragic stories
narrated by Jierold (Our Gang seems
largely to have died horribly before the
age of 40, and I still recall Bobby
Breen in Sydney telling of the squalid
demises of most of his contemporaries),
here is one Cinderella story that really
happened, and makes Hollywood’s
legends seem not quite so hollow after
all.
Voices of Indonesia
By JAMES KIRKUP
Westerly. Special Issue on Indonesia.
University of Western Australia. 60c.
jj WAS in Malaysia, from 1961 to
1962, dispensing or decanting Eng-
bsh Literature at the University of
Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. It was not
a happy time for me: I longed only to
get back to Japan. Some of that
period’s trials, as well as a large num-
ber of unexpected delights, are des-
cribed in my book about Malaysia,
“Tropic Temper” (Collins, London,
1963).
Among the happier occasions were
my meetings with Malay poets, and
the compilation of a small anthology of
modern Malay verse in English trans-
lation with the originals en face. This
was entitled “Sajak MeJayu Baru,
1946-61,” and was published by the
Kuala Lumpur branch of the Oxford
University Press in 1963. The poets
represented were: Usman Awan, Mas-
uri S. N., A. Samad Said, A. S. Amin,
Noor S. 1., and Salmi Manja.
None of the poets I knew in Malaysia
is represented in this special issue of
“Westerly,” for it is devoted only to
the writers of Indonesia, and does not
include Malay authors, who write in
the same language. Indeed, many
modern Malay writers look to Indo-
nesia for political and cultural inspira-
tion and orientation. They also admire
the efforts to purify and invigorate the
national language. As this issue is so
successful, I should like to suggest a
later issue devoted solely to writers in
Malaysia. /
A most interesting opening section,
entitled “The Revival and Sharpening
of the Indonesian Language,” contains
two excellent essays: “Bahasa Indonesia
as a National Language,” by Dr. A. H.
Johns, the first person ever to hold a
Foundation Chair of Indonesian and
Malay Studies in the British Common-
wealth; and “The Development of
Bahasa Indonesia,” by Dr. Soebardi.
Both writers belong to the Australian
National University in Canberra.
Dr. Johns speaks of the “adaptability
and sensitiyity” of this language as rep-
resented in the new schools of Indo-
nesian literature. The most remark-
able part of this remarkable issue is
the large section devoted to modern
Indonesian poetry.
It is not only the poetry itself that
is remarkable; the stylishness and
accuracy of the translators are admir-
able. When one reads the beautiful and
obviously honest versions by M. A.
Jaspan, one is conscious that transla-
tion is an art. What is even more re-
markable is the fact that many of the
other translations have been done by
students of the University of Western
Australia who, in the words of the
Introduction, “participated in an inten-
sive twelve weeks’ course in the Indon-
esian and Malay language, held from
April to June, 1965.”
This was indeed an epoch-making ex-
periment, and one which ought to be
taken up by other language-teaching
universities. I have always believed that
the writing of poetry is the best prepar-
ation for the writing of good prose. It
seems to be equally true that the
translation of poetry is the best prepar-
ation for the translation of prose. Cer-
tainly these student versions are dis-
tinguished both as poems in their own
right and as translations. We have
here representative work by leading-
names in modern Indonesian literature
Asian, Usmar Ismail, Chairil Anwar,
Trisno Sumardjo, and Sitor Situmorang
among others. On the last-named poet
Professor Johns contributes an illumin-
ating essay with many translations of
examples of the poet’s work. This,
essay is most valuable in showing us
the effects of the new “national con-
sciousness” on the poet’s later develop-
ment, and also the weaknesses inherent
in Sitor Situmorang’s later style of
“engaged” writing weaknesses of
rhetoric and tone and vocabulary that
also vitiate the work of some of the
more politically progressive Malay
poets, such as Usman Awang.
*J*HERE is also a section of short
stories by Pramudya Ananta Tur,,
Indonesia’s master of this craft, and by
T. B. Darwin Effendi. This section has:
fascinating introductory essays on the
art of the Cherpen or short story by
M. A. Jaspan and Dr. Soebardi. Pram-
udya’s stories are the essays of a wilful
and gifted child, discursive, humorous,
full of poetry and physical pleasures. In
them I admire again the Indonesian’s
gay fecklessness and volatility, his
child-like adoration of the new and the-
pretty and the “sophisticated”: . . -
New York, New York!
Traveller’s luck, it’s life!
Leaning out of their window,
He and she, man and wife,
Can see through drifting snow
The neon lights of bars
Two or three girlie places
And, stepping out of cars,
The furs, if not the faces.
More, perhaps, than they know,
Though not what they had reckoned:
A shabby cheap hotel
Somewhere on Fifty-second,
With nowhere else to go
And nobody much to tell.

Painful

It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors —including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets—now

In his diary Soleiman placed a sign
with green ink that flowed from a

read, in a last-minute footnote to the
Introduction, that as a consequence of
the September 30 incident Pramudya
has been detained and that his fate is
uncertain: that a writer of such great
gifts should be subjected to such a
fate at once makes one throw doubts
upon the motives of a government that
could allow such a crime. I hope that
Pramudya lives. His work will cer-
tainly live after him.
Finally, a word about the photographs
of modern Indonesian wood-carvings
and paintings. The watercolor portrait
head by Harijati was hardly worth re-
producing: its slickness and emptiness
are echoed in the wood carvings by
Made Trongking. One has only to com-
pare these effete “native-style” creations
with the dynamic design of the carving,
vigorous, uninhibited, and reminiscent of
Javanese shadow-puppets, by “an un-
known Balinese artist” (why should
this superb modern artist be “unknown,”
one wonders?), to see where the essen-
tial weaknesses of a newly emergent
nationalist culture lie.
Inside the Furnace
By JOHN BAXTER
Committal Chamber. Russell Braddon.
Heinemann. $3.
The Saliva Tree. Brian Aldiss. Faber.
$2.65.
Russell braddon had, to use
a phrase that crops up regularly
in “Committal Chamber,” a Good
War. “The Naked Island” is almost
the prison-camp book, and his reverent
memoirs of Leonard Cheshire and
Nancy Wake slip neatly into place in
the crowded literature of the field
somewhere between the tough human-
ism of Paul Brickhill and the maudlin
excesses of his imitators. With the
war boom over, Braddon kept writing
the same sort of books that built his
reputation. His biography of Joan
Sutherland made her a peacetime
Nancy Wake, half heroine, half national
monument, while his science fictional
satire “The Year of the Angry Rabbit”
had the ring of “Is this what we fought
to save?”
“Committal Chamber” is, in essence,
a men-at-war novel about men at peace.
The furnace room of the London
crematorium where Edwin, Tony, and
Ivor work might just as well be a slit
trench or pill-box; the pressures of
working close to death, of being
penned-up together all day, eating,
washing, working in a tiny room, are
the same as those of war. To strengthen
the parallel, Edwin was Ivor’s com-
manding officer during the war, and
obtained this after-retirement job only
through Ivor’s nomination. To the
tough, randy Ivor and the prissy,
crossword-completing Edwin, Tony is
an outsider. Too young to have been
in the war, he nevertheless expresses
the sentiments of all rookies, exhibits
the same weary cynicism, is just as
violent in his rejection of kindness and
friendship.
L many war books, “Committal
Chamber” is about sex. Mocking or
envious by turns, the three men circle
one another, making guarded observa-
tions on virility in modern life while
the bodies drop with predictable regu-
larity into the committal chamber from
the chapel outside and are in due
course consigned to the flames.
Brief flash-backs to life outside the
crematorium provide some insight into
the characters of the three men, the
most significant being that, despite his
splendid equipment, Ivor is sterile. Tony
is also shown as a paranoiac on the
verge of collapse because of shame over
his sexual inadequacy, and Edwin as a
weakling dominated by his scornful
wife. Had these elements been deployed
effectively, the committal chamber
might have become in the novel’s latter
stages an enclave of doomed souls with,
correspondingly heightened atmosphere
and significance. Mr. Braddon, however,
allows it to descend into Grand Guignol,
with a crazed Tony drugging Ivor and
putting him into the furnace, then gig-
gling over the joke as Edwin unthink-
ingly gets ready to turn on the flame.
What might have been Beckett turns
out to be Hitchcock, even to The Mas-
ter’s last touch of grisly humor.
The full title of Brian Aldiss’ “The
Saliva Tree And Other Strange
Growths” is more than a brief joke
inserted to fit the Victorian nature of
the lead novelette; these stories are
growths, offshoots from the body of
conventional science fiction. At least
three “The Lonely Habit,” “A
Pleasure Shared,” and “One Role, With
Relish” are not sf nor fantasy by
a long chalk. Excursions into the
macabre world of Christie, and the
Moors Murderers, they seem irrelevant
despite their parallels with science fic-
tion’s more grisly forms.
fiction, Aldiss seems to be
saying, blends imperceptibly at
some points with contemporary litera-
ture. The two short, witty stories about
dismembered corpses and quiet murd-
erers in public lavatories share with
science fiction the refusal to accept
character as a basis for plot. Kingsley
Amis has observed that, in sf, the plot is
the hero; all the stories in “The Saliva
Tree” share this basic approach. That
their content varies so widely indicates
that, in this collection, Aldiss is deter-
mined to test every possible permutation
of the science fictional method.
Brave experiment often leads to big
disasters, and some of Aldiss’ attempts
result in stories that, though potentially
interesting, are so mismanaged as to be
embarrassing. “The Source” is of this
order, a dreary fantasy where a handful
of those high-minded futurians in pris-
tine togas is knocked all of a heap by
primitives playing pipes and frolicking
in the undergrowth. There is little more
to recommend “Legends of Smith’s
Burst,” with its string of tall stories all
dependent on the basic assumption,
never very well documented (nor, one
would think, capable of adequate docu-
mentation), that a planet could exist
where every creature belonged to a dif-
ferent race. Like so much bad science
fiction these stories exhibit the sort of
flippancy that makes it impossible for
the average reader ever to accept the
real truth that presumably underlies
the ridiculous action.
The good stories, however, come off
splendidly, exhibiting the flair and
polish we have come to recognise as
Aldiss’ trademarks. “The Saliva Tree”
is more than an elaborate parody of
H. G. Wells. It evokes the whole world
of Victorian literature, with its sweep,
its faith in grand schemes and final de-
cisions. The beginning is stiff and faintly
ridiculous, full of Wellesian concepts
that* don’t quite come off, but, as the
characters and settings are established,

Runner
By DISCUS
The Unforgiving Minute. Ron Clarke.
Pelham Books. $3.85.
RON CLARKE is the great enigma
of world athletics, the man who
has held all the records up to
10,000 metres in distance running, but
does not win gold medals at Common-
wealth and Olympic Games. Many
experts have offered as many different
reasons for this. They all remain inter-
esting theories. And in “The Unfor-
giving Minute” Clarke also theorises
but says nothing 'conclusive, unless it
is to be found on the last page (174)
of the book: “The physical standards
of the human race continually improve,
but in any one era it is up to one
individual to make the breakthrough.
That to me is part of the challenge of
athletics.”
How Clarke has met this challenge
is well told. The writing is left to Alan
Trengove, a versatile Melbourne journa-
list who has collaborated with such
men as Herb Elliott and a bevy of
tennis players in previous books, and
with Australian Rules extrovert Lou
Richards in a series of memorable news-
paper articles which captured the prin-
cipal’s mood.
rfRENGOVE and Clarke begin the
story with Clarke’s description of
the Tokyo 10,000 metres and how he
lost to Billy Mills, ending with, “Two
of the criticisms that have been levelled
at me throughout my career are that I
lack killer instinct and don’t take com-
petition and, more specifically, defeat
grimly enough ... I had better explain
here and now my philosophy.” Which
he does, thoroughly but inconclusively,
in the next chapter, immediately
making it clear that Clarke thinks,
analyses, theorises perhaps too much
for an athlete, even if the subject is
athletics. However, it does make for a
more interesting book than most in the
sports field, where the mental effort
stays mostly in the mind, seldom gets
out into the print, where in default the

now available. Copies may be ordered
for $2.46, including postage, from
Box 4088, G.P.0., Sydney.
journalist does the best he can with a
little material.
Thus Clarke’s narrative of his grow-
ing interest in running, his experiences
with trainers and methods, his successes
and failures overseas, and, in particular,
what it has felt like to run under the
various conditions of each meet, what
tactics were planned against each field
and how easily those' plans did, or
could have, come unstuck, and, finally,
in the really tough ones, how it felt to
reach the threshold of absolute fatigue,
and pass into the phase where he
endured torture to see how much the
body could stand.
Why anyone should bother is a
natural question, probably answerable
only as men can say why they climb
mountains, try to race cars at 200 mph,
or jump farther than anyone else on
skis. The answers are in the appendix
of distance running records at the back
of the book, from Shrubb in 1903 to
Kuts in 1954 to Clarke in 1965, clip-
ping one or two minutes off the times
in 60-odd years. “Why” is the other
question Ron Clarke does not answer.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Feudal on Wages?
NORMALLY the Director of the British Prices and In-
comes Board would get a lot of attention in the
Australian Press. But he happened to be here when
a more controversial character had the attention of newsmen.
Premier Ky after all makes Mr. Aubrey Jones look rather
ordinary! He appears to have come simply to talk and
learn about our unique system of compulsory arbitration. The
British, of course, have an extremely dispersed and undisci-
plined system of wage fixing, and it is proving a great
handicap in attempts to give effect to the Labor Govern-
ment’s incomes policy. So, no doubt, it would be most
convenient for them to have a centralised, relatively disci-
plined wage-fixing system like ours, and Mr. Jones will be
looking at it for this reason. No one expects the British
to adopt it in its entirety, but we may see them copy some
of its features.
For us, the visit of Mr. Jones, if not very newsworthy,
at least stimulates some thoughts about our own arrange-
ments. Most countries have settled on their policy but do not
have an efficient vehicle to carry it into effect. We, almost
alone, have the vehicle, but have been extraordinarily slow
in devising the policy. It is accepted in almost every advanced
Western country that unless wage rates are kept in line
with the advance of productivity they will exert pressure on
costs and contribute to inflation and balance-of-payments
problems. So a “productivity gearing” principle has been
accepted. It was in fact if not in name accepted by the
Australian Arbitration Commission in 1965. But the Arbitra-
tion Commission these days is about as stable as the Saigon
Government before Mr. Ky, and it was contemptuously
rejected last year. No one knows who will pull off a coup
this year; it is to be hoped that it is the modernists ousting;
the feudalists. The feudalists believe most deeply that they
must eschew all economics lest their attention be diverted
from the task of smelling out a “just wage.” Sometimes they
maintain that this is one which will be acceptable to both,
sides, a compromise between workers’ demands and bosses’
offers.
This is a rather phony business, because there is a very
wide margin between a basic wage on the low side, which
would provoke general strikes and industrial unrest, and
a wage on the high side, which would put firms out of busi-
ness and cause layoffs. A wage increase on this basis is-
bound to be arbitrary. There is also no such thing as a
“just wage” viewed objectively. One view held by the Com-
mission has been that it is just that the purchasing power of
wages should be maintained by cost-of-living adjustments.
This old principle sounds fine in theory, and it has a good
conservative ring about it. In practice it can often be ridicu-
lous. In recent budgets, for instance, the Government raised
sales taxes on a number of consumer goods in order to reduce-
spending power and divert resources to other uses. Is the
Arbitration Commission to take it on itself to undo this by
maintaining the purchasing power of wages? The same can
happen in times of higher imports prices. A stubborn adher-
ence to maintaining the real value of wages can only lead to
inequitable redistributions of income away from people on
fixed incomes, social service beneficiaries, and farmers.
Of course there are several difficulties involved in the
implementation of a wages policy. If it is to be fair and to
be accepted, union leaders can rightly insist that other
incomes be eliminated as an inflationary element as well. In.
MEN AND MATTERS
THINGS go better with local boys
at the top for the Coca-Cola
company. Eighteen months ago,
52-year-old Sydney-born John R.
Ennis, Coke’s regional manager here,
was appointed area manager for Aus-
tralasia and the South Pacific and also
was the first Australian to become a
vice-president of the Coca-Cola Export
Corporation, the world’s largest soft
drink company. And last week 49-
year-old Dubbo-born Gordon Christie
became assistant area manager for Aus-
tralasia.
So now there are no Americans in
senior administrative or technical jobs
in the local Coca-Cola operation; it’s a
completely locally run show.
John Ennis, a Bachelor of Economics
from Sydney University and former
RAAF bomber pilot (DFC), not only
runs Coke’s local operations but he
has to keep his eye on the activities of
30 independent franchise bottling com-
panies.
Born in Drummoyne and now living
in Balgowlah with his wife and two of
his three daughters, he is a former Fort
Street boy who won his way to univer-
sity on scholarships. His father retired
some years ago as a foreman boiler-
maker at Cockatoo Dock. Joining Coke
as a cashier in 1938 within weeks of
Coke opening its first Sydney bottling
plant, he became the accountant before
spending the war flying in Britain,
Egypt, and Italy,
and then moved
up the Coke hier-
archy.
Gordon Christie
spent most of his
life in Dubbo -
at school, as sec-
retary of the
Dubbo Base Hos-
pital (he married
its “most profici-
ent nurse” of
1942) after doing
accountancy which
he completed while convalescing for
three years from a serious illness, as a
partner in a local accountancy practice
he set up with his brother in 1946, and
as district coroner for 11 years. But
since 1955, when he joined Coke, he
has been all around the South Pacific.
THE Swan Brewery’s Western Aus-
tralian brewing monopoly was
broken last week by a man
who makes mead. This olde Englishe
beverage, forerunner of English ale, is
made in a three-month process of fer-
mentation, pasteurisation, and sediment-
ation from apple juice and honey. The
maker is 46-year-old Johann Amann,
who lives alone in a cottage on his
Upper Kalgan property, near Albany.
Mr. Amann learnt about mead-
making while working as a forester in
Johann Amann
J. R. Ennis
G. Christie
Germany’s Black Forest, and when he-
became an apiarist in his new country
eight years ago he found this an easy
step to revival of the old arts. When
he was granted the State’s first com-
mercial licence to produce mead last
week, he had 1100 gallons ready for
sale from the huge vats he has built
from Mt. Barker soapstone. The move
was favored by the State Government,
who pointed to the over-supply oF
honey.
And the taste of the new product?
It compares favorably with some
sauterne-type wines, according to Agri-
culture Department viticulturist Mr.
W. R. Jamieson. With a 12 percent
alcohol content, it is warming, but not
heady like a fortified wine; rather it
resembles the lighter wines of low
alcohol content.


particular, the restrictive practices legislation must be got
working and eventually broadened. Just as important is
some social supervision of the charges made by our tightest
little cartels the associations of lawyers, doctors, and other
professional types.
It is worth saying in conclusion on this topic that the
Arbitration Commissioners are not entirely to blame for the
sloppy way in which the Commission operates. They work
under a quite obsolete Act. No longer is a basic wage case
merely an industrial dispute. It has huge national economic
repercussions. The Act should be amended as suggested by
the Vernon Committee to instruct the Commission to take
these into account.
Growth Goes West
ONLY factors from outside Western Australia are likely
to retard the State’s growth over the next few months,
according to the latest summing-up in the authoritative
University of W.A. economics department quarterly,
“Economic Activity in Western Australia.”
For a State so dependent on primary industry, the pointers
were favorable indeed: “The growth in the rural sector of
the economy is exemplified by the continued development
of over 1 million acres of new land each year, and annual
additions in recent years of almost 2 million to the sheep
population . . . Indications are that farmers will receive
higher incomes still in the current season. These incomes in
turn will reinforce investments in rural holdings which are
being made from outside the State, and maintain the high
level of capital expenditure in this sector of the economy.
One direct result is that demand is increasing in industries
which manufacture and service farm equipment and supplies.
High rural incomes will also support the buoyant conditions
which are generally present in the economyr”
One point brought out in the review is tliat, in contrast
to the national trend, the West’s motor industry had been
moving ahead strongly in 1966: “Figures for total registra-
tions in Australia indicate a major decline in demand, the
most severe experienced since 1961. The figures for Western
Australia are opposite to this trend, and are higher than
those for corresponding periods in previous years. This is
important, not because the motor vehicle industry is a large
employer of labor in this State but as an indicator of buyer
confidence that the high level of activity in the State will
continue.”
There are bull points, too, for employment, in which “the
inference is that the population of the State is growing at a
rate more than twice that of the whole of Australia . . .
The rate of growth in the workforce in the State has been
remarkable in recent years. Total civilian employment rose
5.2 percent from July, 1964, to June, 1965, and rose again
by 5.7 percent in the year ended June, 1966.” Retrenchments
of Pilbara workers have dampened the pressure on the labor
supply, says the analysis, and have helped hold back the
upward pressure on wages. “In the short-term the high level
of employment must continue, with labor-hungry production
in metropolitan areas absorbing labor which becomes avail-
able from other industries and from migration.” Seasonal
demand would be accentuated by the expected record grain
harvest.
Summing up, the review forecasts two distinct movements
in the next 12 months: increasing secondary development
and the acceleration of entry to the West of firms from out-
side the State. This would tend to widen production and
employment possibilities. So “it is unlikely that any major
decline in economic activity will occur in the near future, but
if a decline does occur it is likely to result from national
forces and would then be dependent for its arrest on fiscal
and monetary counter-measures applied by the Federal
authorities.”
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
F Or the economy ; In a thorough analysis of the
New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Pro-
fessor F. W. Holmes, of Wellington (N.Z.), saw doubts
on its success arising from the partners’ “previous mari-
tal record and some of their present attitudes, both to
relations with one another and to the external problems
with which they are confronted.”
December’s employment statistics showed the number
seeking employment (up 16,580 to 76,457) as the lowest
for this month since 1961; registered vacancies fell from
about 55,500 to 52,000.
Trading bank advances rose in December by $21.6m.
to a record $2952.2m., their first December rise for 12
years; deposits also reached a fresh peak by putting on
sBom. to $5297.9m. . . . November’s hire-purchase
outstandings added some sl2m. to touch $ 1084 m., which
is $BOO,OOO above the level at the previous November.
F or the marhets : Perhaps Australian share mar-
kets have already begun to wait upon the first stream
of interim reports, for last week’s dealings looked con-
siderably less impetuous than earlier. Overall, the situ-
ation-appears tolerably firm for a wide range of indus-
trials; the approach to base metals has become a little
more critical. Uraniums and golds still draw attention.
Some hope is spreading through London from the
Common Market peregrinations, so engineering, elec-
trical, and chemicals issues are reasonably sought; sellers
tend to hold off . . . Wall Street may “consolidate” soon,
but prospects of easier money are helping a current
upward spell.
F Or companies : Glimmers of cheer for motor
dealers came from Sydney GM-H dealer C. V. Hol-
land, whose earnings leapt 115 percent in the December
six months and enabled interim payment to go from
nothing to 4 percent; directors, however, take credit for
increased efficiency, since turnover was 1.7 percent
below the corresponding 1965-66 period.
It’s progress all the way for the life companies . . .
Following the AMP’s latest trail, the Mutual Life and
Citizens’, the Prudential, Northern Life, and Royal-
Globe Life all report solid gains in new business and new
premium income, Mutual Life and the Pru establishing
records once more . . . “In uncertain times, an increasing
number turn to life assurance,” MLC’s general mana-
ger, Mr. A. F. Deer, rhapsodises.
Another success story, its extent only awaited, duly
arrived from King Island Scheelite, which sent profit
bounding by 73.6 percent to $886,575; the already
announced dividend is 48 percent (24 cents a share)
. . . More muted in tone, Mount Isa yielded 1.1 percent
more copper in four weeks to January 15 but less lead
and zinc.
Inadequate margins on petrol sales are blamed for
Ampol Petroleum’s 1965-66 profit slide; directors be-
lieve earnings will advance at least 10 percent this year,
adequately permitting retention of the 10 percent divi-
dend on vastly higher capital . . . Australian Consoli-
dated Industries (ACI) expects “rather better” results
for the year ending March 31 . . . Output from all sec-
tions of BHP was much better this December than
last; pig iron and steel ingots were somewhat lower than
November . . . John Lysaght is to cultivate the North
Queensland market by making corrugated steel roofing
at Townsville.
“Anything that Carlton and United Breweries Ltd.
do, we will do even better,” asserts Sir Maurice Nathan,
chairman of Courage Breweries Pty., to begin selling
beer to untied Victorian houses late in 1968 . . . Mean-
while Carlton’s new slom. debenture issue will help
finance further buying of hotels . . . On the issue front
also, Cresco Fertilizers proposes a l-for-3 bonus and will
maintain the prevailing 10 percent dividend.


Comfort for the Consumer
By CROESUS
THE satisfaction of wants being the
raison d’etre of most economic
activity, it is understandable that
the more materialistically minded
among us should be obsessed with get-
ting the best deal possible for con-
sumers. Some will see, however, that
this is not necessarily good business,
because the main object of most busi-
ness is to maximise profit. In making
laws to protect consumers, the State
has necessarily to draw a fine line to
ensure the viability of businesses and
the reasonable satisfaction of their
clients.
The task of drawing this line is
immensely complicated. Obviously
business has to abide by some rules to
prevent it exploiting consumers. My
point all along about the trade prac-
tices legislation has not been that rules
are not necessary. Rules are very
necessary to safeguard consumers’
interests and indeed the book is full of
them. What I’ve objected to is that
expensive machinery is to be set up
for the registration and examination of
trade practices when a simple complaint
system, as in New Zealand, would
suffice to do the job without creating
a new and expensive tranche of bureau-
cracy.
It’s no good crying over spilt milk,
so we’d better face the fact that the
new trade practices ball will soon be
rolling in earnest, let us hope as ben-
evolently as possible. But heaven help
us if the Government takes up the
suggestion made recently by somebody
in THE BULLETIN and proceeds to
outlaw resale price maintenance, which,
despite some abuses, is the keystone of
orderly marketing in this country. I’m
not in favor of retail price control
either, at least as it is espoused by the
ALP, because of the dangers of bottled-
up inflation. I believe that thought
along these lines should be channelled
into the possibilities of establishing
Government-sponsored trade committees
to keep an eye on profit margins
throughout the manufacturers-whole-
salers-retailers kaleidoscope.
In the meantime it is salutary that
the assembled Attorneys-General last
year hammered out some new rules to
be adopted in uniform legislation
throughout the Commonwealth to
strengthen the various Federal and
State Weights and Measures Acts. At
the time of writing, amendments to the
Victorian Act had reached the Legis-
lative Council stage. This legislation
changes some of the rules governing the
packaging and marketing of products
and was inspired primarily by the
Cuthill report on Australian packaging
in May, 1964.
It will be recalled that the Cuthill
report, which examined everything
marketed “from cement to semen,”
created a great flutter among manufac-
turers and traders, especially those
named in it for particular alleged
abuses. The report itself had a salutary
effect in that many of the alleged
offenders decided to clean up their own
houses in advance of any official action.
It also had the effect of galvanising the
many organisations on the warpath for
consumer protection and with the in-
stitution at about the same time of the
Consumer Protection Council in Vic-
toria it gave them, at least in that State,
a useful sounding board for venting
complaints which should be the envy
of the rest of the Commonwealth.
'J'HE separate amendments to the
Weights and Measures Act are too
detailed to enumerate here, but it is
pertinent to note that in future local
government bodies, which at present
bear the practical responsibility for
weights and measures, will be able to
pass the buck to the State Government,
which in turn will be able to revoke
agreements made by local authorities or
superintendents. When it is considered
that the Consumer Protection Council
operates directly under the Attorney-
General’s Department, it will be seen
that the State looks to be taking on
more responsibility for consumer pro-
tection, though of course the CPC
would not in itself have any power to
enforce its findings on nefarious prac-
tices in the Courts (as is envisaged, say,
for the Trade Practices Tribunal
through the Industrial Court).
Even so, the CPC appears to have
taken on a pseudo-policeman’s role in
some respects. For example, vis-a-vis
the Door to Door (Sales) Act, in its
first report issued last month it recom-
mends amendments to that Act to make
the detection of offenders easier. About
nine percent of the 464 complaints re-
ceived by the Council in its first year
were protests about door-to-door sales
practices, such as that products belie
salesmen’s promises, cases of hit and
run salesmen, misrepresentations con-
cerning inducements offered in the form
of commissions, and bait advertising
leading to switch selling at the door
(as when an appliance is advertised at
a very low price and a salesman arrives
trying to sell a much more expensive
article).
I would expect legislation to stiffen
the Door to Door Sales Act along the
lines of the CPC’s recommendations,
inter alia to give five days’ effective
grace for sales; repairs and renovation
agreements made “outside” as well as
“inside” a buyer’s house; to make inter-
state companies keep an office in the
State for the serving of terminating
notices within the five-day grace period,
and to police the rendering to buyers of
the schedule outlining his rights under
the Act.
Apropos of all this, it is significant
that the CPC made an early decision
to carry out preliminary investigations
into complaints through trade associa-
tions, official authorities, and its own
panel of a hundred housewives before
passing them on for further considera-
tion to “appropriate bodies,” instead of
doing it the other way round. How
it managed to do this when last year
it was getting almost two complaints
each working day with only one officer
to follow them through can only be
surmised.
Most of the complaints made in its
first year of operation were at the
second stage; that is, after the injured
party had exhausted his own means of
getting rectification. In the more seri-
ous cases the CPC referred complain-
ants to their solicitors or the Legal Aid
Council; otherwise it tackled the com-
pany or the trade association concerned
direct and thereby settled about a quar-
ter of all complaints lodged last year.
For what it is worth in throwing light
on the relative incidence of evils stem-
ming from resale price maintenance, the
main area of complaint to the CPC
concerned repairs, mostly of domestic
electrical appliances (39.2 percent of
all the complaints made during the
year). Another 6.3 percent related to
repairs of motor vehicles, houses, and
other electrical installations. Only
percent concerned shop sales and prices.
My last thought here about this is
that Victoria seems to have successfully
launched a complaint system whereby
consumers can vent their grievances
big and small against their exploitation
by business. None of the other States
have yet followed this example, but one
can well imagine that if they did so the
Trade Practices Tribunal would lose
much of its potential business and save
the taxpayer a great deal of money.

MAN ON THE LAND
Forthright on Acquisition
A GREAT deal of clarification is
needed before the marketing plan
for wool advanced by Mr. Bryce
Killen can be judged by both wool-
growers and non-woolgrowers, who
might end up paying for it. The plan,
in its initial stages, certainly has some
attractive aspects. In its latter stages,
where it envisages the entry of the IWS
and the Wool Board into direct sales,
and even manufacturing, it appears to
invite bureaucratic control. The first-
point to be clarified should be whether
this is Mr. Killen’s own plan or a plan
presented to him on behalf of the IWS
and the Wool Board.
In this plan, as in most, the danger
is that pursuit of the plan could become
the real objective rather than the well-
being of the growers it is supposed to
serve. Much would depend on who ran
it and how anxious they were to reach
the latter stages.
Wool would be sold by auction while
the trade continued to show a desire
for auctions, Mr. Killen said in his
outline of the plan. That seems reason-
able. The Australian wool marketing
commission, to be set up with backing
of $9B million from the Federal Govern-
ment, would operate “step by step to
known and assured positions.” Assuming
that the first step convincing the
Government that the plan was neces-
sary could be taken, the “step by
step” procedure seems reasonable also.
We commend Mr. Killen for his pre-
cise explanation of what might happen
to passed-in wools. The commission
would not withhold more than ten per-
cent of the Australian wool clip in any
normal circumstances. Every effort
would be made to dispose satisfactorily,
at the commission’s discretion, any
passed-in wool outside the auction sys-
tem. Limiting the passing-in to 10 per-
cent does not appear to be a prelude
to takeover of the wool industry by the
proposed marketing commission.
QTHER aspects of Mr. Killen’s plan
relating to payments to the grower
for his wool (60 percent within seven
days and 20 percent within five
months), the creation of two six-
monthly selling pools, and provision for
brokers’ appraisers to represent growers
are by no means radical proposals. In
all we could well imagine a good
number of woolgrowers going along
with this plan.
We do not see any great threat to
anyone at present earning a living in
the wool industry in this plan and that
is one of the attractive aspects. Obvi-
ously, private buying would have no
place if the plan came into existence;
presumably there would be immediate
need for appraisers for both the pro-
posed commission and the brokers, and
a skilled private buyer could probably
get himself a good salary. But unless
the Government is prepared to provide
$9B million, the plan is just one of the
many which have been advanced from
time to time.
The chances of growers themselves
providing the $9B million are remote
and, going on the 1965 reserve-price
experience, the private banks would
want a strong lead from the Govern-
ment before entering into any arrange-
ment. Whatever the views of the Fed-
eral Members themselves might be, we
somehow cannot see the public sector
advisers to the Government being as
enthusiastic over this plan as they were
over reserve price; or might be over
acquisition and sale at negotiated prices.
The reserve-price plan, as presented
by the Wool Board, gave promise of
much public sector activity (with quai'-
ters rivalling perhaps even those of
the Reserve Bank); acquisition of the
entire clip and sale by negotiated prices
would be a planner’s dream come true.
If Mr. Killen is sincere about his “step
by step to known and assured positions”
theme, and there is no reason to sup-
pose he is not, then this plan does have
safeguards against the power-hungry,
who, unfortunately, will always be witbr-
us.
Mr. Killen has not made any rash
promise about “guaranteed prices” or
“cost of production.” Other wool lead-
ers have and it will be a pity if, in
order to win support from growers,
he uses this tactic. The Wool Industry
Conference will provide a useful guide
as to the reaction by the “cost of pro-
duction” sector of growers. Even if Mr.
Killen cannot get support for his plan
from the N.S.W. Graziers’ Association
proper (and at the moment that sup-
port appears somewhat doubtful), he
would have no difficulty in getting his
plan put up for discussion at an AWIC
meeting if he included a “guaranteed
prices” or “cost of production” clause.
But if he should do this it would mean
that he had “crossed the House.”
Fie has always been a member of the
Graziers’ Association and has shown no
indication of changing. The Graziers’
side of the AWIC is unlikely to accept
“cost of production” because that would
mean Government subsidy (and some-
thing more than $9B million). In any
case it is almost an economic impossi-
bility to decide what is cost of produc-
tion for wool. The Wool and Meat
Producers’ Federation side of the
AWIC, and to a lesser extent perhaps
the Australian Primary Producers’
Union segment, is strongly under the
influence of wheat stabilisation and is
very “cost of production” conscious.
So that woolgrowers, other than the
300 who attended the Moree meeting,
may judge this plan in the broad
sense, we would like to see Mr. Killen

TO THE GROWTH OF AUSTRALIA


declare his views on “cost of pro-
duction.”
There appears to be an unfortunate
tendency to label woolgrowers as a
disorganised, embittered collection of
individualists, just because they hold
meetings at which different views are
put forward. We do not see any evi-
dence of this kind of thing in the
Moree meeting, but, at the same time,
the locality is not unimportant. We
would say, in general terms only, that
woolgrowers in western plairis and
Queensland areas, where alternative or
supplementary forms of livestock rais-
ing or agriculture are difficult, would
perhaps support the Killen proposal.
in closer settled,
higher rainfall areas, where alter-
natives are more feasible, might (if
plan-minded) press for some “guaran-
teed prices” scheme which would delay
having to make a decision on an
alternative.
No woolgrower that we know of is
likely to consider the impact that this,
or any, plan is likely to have on the
Australian urban taxpayer. To the
woolgrower, foreign exchange means
loads of money in banks in London,
Tokyo, New York, etc., and (to the
woolgrowter) this is most comforting
and means that decisions can be taken
“in the national interest.” No wool-
grower, or dairy farmer, or anyone
in a particular and specific industry,
we suppose, is likely to agree that
foreign exchange can be created equally
as well, perhaps better, by other trans-
actions requiring less taxpayer sub-
sidy and, in some cases, no subsidy at
all.
Let no one undervalue wool as an
earner of foreign exchange. But neither
let anyone undervalue the pursuit of
personal improvement on the part of all
members of the community. As things
stand woolgrowers are not the only
Australians who believe they are stand-
ing still or slipping backwards slowly.
It is possible that grower approval
of the Killen proposal, or any other
plan, may not be a measure of its
bearing on the “national interest.” Sir
William Gunn discovered (and never
quite recovered from) the fact that in
order to get the Support of grower
numbers it was necessary to promise
that stabilised wool prices meant
stabilised high prices and/or guaranteed
cost of production by subsidy. This
might not apply if growers voted
according to the sheep they owned,
yet while we can sympathise with some
who advocate this form of voting we
really cannot see any Australian
Government permitting it. Australia
is not Rhodesia, nor is it Argentina.
Rather the Government might be
prevailed upon to act without recourse
to a growers’ referendum, in which case
Mr. Killen’s plan, and all the other
plans, are useful information; and, in
which case, the best the taxpayer can
hope for is that the elected repre-
sentatives in Parliament exhibit more
familiarity with the subject than they
have in the past.
AGRISEARCH
It's Good Taste for Sheep
SHEEP have surprising and subtle
tastes. Working at Canberra,
CSIRO scientist G. Arnold has
shown that the smell and taste ol
many of ouY common grazing legumes
are offensive to sheep; that nine fine-
leaved varieties of cocksfoot are less
acceptable than any of fourteen broad-
leaved strains; that the brome grasses
are liked because they appeal to a
sheep’s sense of touch; and that some
Strains of phalaris at certain times of
the year are completely rejected by
sheep. Who would have guessed that
lucerne, of all plants, is one that sheep
have a strong aversion for during
spring?
Working at Deniliquin, other CSIRO
scientists J. H. Leigh and W. E. Mul-
ham found that, in a native pasture,
bladder saltbush (Atriplex vesicaria)
was almost entirely ignored, although
it was the dominant species. The sheep
preferred to hunt around for the rela-
tively sparse grasses and herbs that grow
here and there among the bushes. Like-
wise, in a second type of native pasture
composed mainly of the cotton bushes
(Kochia aphylla and K. pentagona)
and various grasses the sheep turned
to the cotton bushes only when they
had little or rto other alternative. Then
they ate first the rarer K. pentagona.
In winter and spring, sheep on this
pasture, unless the stocking rate was
high, consumed wallaby grass and
various annual grasses and herbs. In
summer they sought out the biennial
grasses Sporobulus caroli and Chloris
truncata.
Though Sporobulus caroli comprised
only one percent of the pasture it ac-
counted for 56 percent of the sheeps’
total intake during summer. The two
grasses together made up nearly two-
thirds of the diet. The perennial salt-
bushes only comprised about six per-
cent. Such remarkable findings as these
clearly indicate the importance of
knowing something about the tastes of
grazing animals. The knowledge can
help provide a basis for sound and
sensible pasture management. In short,
it could lead to greater animal produc-
tion with less likelihood of causing per-
manent damage to the pasture.
Dr. Arnold’s findings will catch the
attention of other agricultural scien-
tists, particularly plant breeders. He
has managed to identify some of the
a; pealing and offensive chemicals in
the plants. Plant breeders will be able
to use his information to select from
their crosses the hybrids with the most
desirable chemical make-up from. the
sheep’s point of view. The preference
for the broad-leaved strains of cocks-
foot, which was found to be based on
taste rather than feel, also indicates race
differences within this species that could
be useful in plant-breeding programs.
The fine-leaved strains came from Spain
and Turkey, whereas the broad-leaved
strains were brought here from other
areas around the Mediterranean and
Europe.
But farmers should note that Arnold
has also demonstrated that the height
of a species in a pasture can have an
over-riding influence on choice. Sheep
prefer the plants they nibble at to be
less than four inches high. Presumably
sheep are as lazy as ourselves and find
that short pasture may be cropped with
less muscular effort. Nor need farmers
feel too despondent over the appearance
of brome grasses in their pastures. Agri-
culturalists used to suggest that stock
avoid the bromes because they find
them unpalatable. Of course, brome
grass has a relatively low feed value,
especially during summer.
The Deniliquin studies, apart from
indicating that other types of pasture
elsewhere ought to be investigated simi-
larly, have immediate practical signifi-
cance and importance. Saltbush
pastures of the kind studied cover
some 15 million acres of the Riverina
Plain and carry some million sheep.
Generally, throughout this area, wool
production is limited by an acute
shortage of feed during late summer
and autumn. The policy of the grazing
management should be to save as much
feed as possible for this period. Other
studies in the area have shown that
carry-over of feed is greater when the
pastures have been grazed relatively
heavily in autumn and winter rather
than in spring, as might be expected.
rpHE reason is that the saltbushes are
slow growers and do not recover
quickly enough to supply good autumn
grazing if they have been eaten off dur-
ing spring. Provided an area is not
stocked too heavily during spring, the
sheep can be relied upon to leave the
saltbushes alone, since they prefer to
pick the annual herbs and grasses,
including Sporobulus and Chloris. Any
carry-over of these species into summer
is simply wasted when they dry off;
Hence they should be fully consumed
while they have feed value during
spring. The grazing pressure should be
carefully adjusted to achieve this, but
just fall short of forcing the sheep
to start eating the saltbush.
Both Arnold and the Deniliquin
people used surgical techniques to
obtain their results. Arnold cut the
nerves relaying the senses of taste, smell,
and touch in the mouth and muzzle (8.,
December 24). Leigh and Mulham put
“hatches” directly into the rumen of
their sheep. These openings which are
mgde in the sides of the sheep are
technically known as oesophageal fistu-
las. By means of them a man can thrust
his hand directly into the rumen and
withdraw the contents before they are
chewed up and digestion makes identifi-
cation of plants swallowed impossible.

Brighter Hopes for Pyrites
FFIHE recent round of price rises by
I North American sulphur pro-
ducers justifies the Federal Gov-
ernment’s concern over the tightening
world supply situation and the growing
costs of Australian imports (see
BULLETIN, July 9, 1966). These de-
velopments have, however, brightened
the prospects of local pyrites producers
who have been struggling to compete
with the imported elemental sulphur
(or brimstone) generally preferred by
sulphuric-acid manufacturers. Over half
of Australia’s sulphuric acid, a vital
component for superphosphate manu-
facture, is made from imported brim-
stone and virtually all Australian im-
ports come from North American
sources.
Over the past two years, the price
paid by Australian sulphuric-acid
manufacturers for imported sulphur has
increased considerably, despite the
existence of long-term contracts which
have generally guaranteed prices below
those ruling on world markets. The
average f.o.b. price per ton has risen
from $17.35 in 1964, to $19.30 in 1965,
to over $26 in the first half of 1966.
With freight costs probably in the order
of $lO per ton, the landed cost in
Australia would have risen to over $36
per ton during the same period.
The Federal Government’s concern
over world price rises has been in-
tensified because most contracts for
Australian supplies will have to be
renewed towards the end of this year.
Results of an investigation by the
Bureau of Mineral Resources an-
nounced last November showed that
when the contracts are being renewed,
$4O per ton will be an absolute mini-
mum, while $44-$46 would be the more
probable new contract prices. However,
the recent North American price rises
indicate that these estimates may be
too low.
Q n December 1, 1966, Freeport

long ton to $U.5.28.50 ($A25.50) f.o.b.
p ort Sulphur, Louisiana. Texas Gulf
followed suit and Mexican producer
Gulf Sulphur- announced that its 1967
ices would be substantia n y aboV e
those in 1966 Xhe largest increase i n
brimstone prices so far has come from
p an Amer ican Sulphur Co, which
raised its local price by SU.S.IO per
ton, effective January 1, 1967. Its con-
tract p rice s are now $U.5.43.50
($A38.50) per ton f.o.b. Florida, and
$U.5.46.25 ($A41.25) delivered to the
u S East Coast,
OBSERVERS say that this is indica-
tive of a new round of price rises
looming in the industry. Pan American
is currently receiving SU.S.SO-52
(around $A.45) for spot sales, and, in
some parts of the world, spot prices up
to $U.5.65 (SA.SB) have been reported,
Some U.S. sulphur producers are said
to be receiving SU.S.4O ($A.35) per
ton and more for contracts for sulphur
exports to Europe and elsewhere.
Taking these price rises as a guide,
and assuming freight costs in the order
of $lO per ton, the new Australian c.i.f.
contract prices could range from
$A.35.50 to SA.6B, although prices be-
tween $A.45 and SA.SO seem the most
likely at this stage.
Some experts are predicting that the
widespread shortage in world sulphur
supplies, the main factor behind the
price rises, may become more critical
in 1967. World production is estimated
to have increased from 22.4 million tons
in 1965 to 24 million tons in 1966. How-
ever, total demand is believed to have
risen from 23.3 million tons to 25 mil-
lion tons over the same period. Results
of one study indicate that demand is
likely to keep ahead of available sup-
plies at least until 1975 despite increases
in capacity from “sour” natural gas
sources in Canada and the Middle East.
The lifting of the Mexican Govern-
ment’s embargo on exports, however,
could alleviate this situation.
Five companies are at present pro-
ducing pyrites in Australia, Norseman
Gold Mines N.L. and Gold Mines of
Kalgoorlie (Aust.) Ltd. in Western
Australia, Nairne Pyrites in South Aus-
tralia, Mount Lyell Mining and Railway
Company Ltd. in Tasmania, and Mount
Morgan Ltd. in Queensland. For Norse-
man and Nairne, the mining of pyrites
forms the whole of their operations
while with the other producers it is
only a by-product. Broken Hill Associ-
ated Smelters, Sulphide Corporation,
the Electrolytic Smelting and Refining
Company and Electrolytic Zinc Co.
also produce sulphur from sinter gas
during their smelting operations.
A new pyrites project, on a larger
scale than any existing Australian
operation, is now being considered by
Pickands Mather and Co., but a de-
cision has not yet been reached on its
economic feasibility. The project en-
visages utilising the 250,000 to 350,000
tons of pyrites containing approxi-
mately 49 percent sulphur which will
be available each year in tailings from
the Savage River iron ore production
in Tasmania.
Sulphuric acid is produced from
pyrites, mainly for use in superphos-
phate production, by CSBP and Cresco
(W.A.) in Western Australia, SAPL in
South Australia, ICIANZ in Victoria,
and Sulphide Corporation in New South
Wales. With the exception of SAPL,
these companies also operate brimstone
acid plants which are preferred by pro-
ducers throughout the world. Capital
costs involved in the extraction of acid
from brimstone are roughly half those
required for pyrites and the process is
less complicated. While brimstone is
virtually pure sulphur, pyrites concen-
trates have a sulphur content usually
of about 48 percent.
However, in view of threatened
shortages of imported brimstone and
the strong growth in demand for
superphosphate in Australia, these fer-
tiliser companies have maintained their
pyrites operations with the help of the
Government bounties which are at
present being reviewed by the Tariff
Board. These bounties are paid at the
basic rates of $6 per ton of sulphuric
content of pyrites produced, $5 per ton
of 100 percent sulphuric acid produced
from pyrites, and $2.20 per ton of

sulphuric acid produced from sinter gas.
These rates were calculated as being-
equal to the average cost disability to
producers and vary according to the
landed cost of brimstone. When the
landed cost of brimstone is more or less
than $32 per ton, the amount of bounty
payable to pyrites producers is corres-
pondingly reduced or increased. The
bounty is also reduced if the net profit
from production of pyrites exceeds 12£
percent of the capital employed for
this use.
At the Tariff Board hearing last
November, one of the producers, Mount
Morgan Ltd., urged the Federal Gov-
ernment to actively encourage the use
of indigenous sources of sulphur. The
suggested means of assistance included
the paying of fixed bounties to the pro-
ducers of pyrites and sulphuric acid
from pyrites for a further period of
ten years; the deletion of the ceiling
clauses on profit, and the exemption
from taxation of income derived from
the manufacture of sulphuric acid from
indigenous sources of sulphur.
Whether or not such suggestions will
be adopted remains to be seen, but
while the landed price of brimstone
continues to rise above $32 per ton,
the production of pyrites is becoming
a more economic proposition. As a
rough guide, the price of $32 per ton
could be taken as an average break-
even price for pyrites mining opera-
tions, since it is the basis for calcu-
lation of bounty payments to pro-
ducers.
,r pHERE are no quoted standard prices
for pyrites in Australia. National
prices calculated by the Tariff Board
for pyrites delivered to acid manufac-
turers during 1963-64 ranged from
$27.80 to $46.90 per ton of sulphur
content. Freight and handling costs
varied from $5.90 to $25.30, suggesting
an average price at the mine of $2l -$22
per ton of sulphur content. At this
stage the landed price of brimstone
was approximately $2B per ton. One
producer, Norseman Gold Mines,
appears to have been getting steady
prices in the vicinity of $33.30 per ton
of sulphur in 48 percent concentrates
over the past three years.
Already, rising world prices have
enabled Mount Morgan to secure a con-
tract to supply 100,000 tons of pyrites
to Japan from April, 1967, at “satisfac-
tory prices.” At a price of, say, $32
per ton and assuming the grade of the
concentrates is 48 percent, the gross
value of this contract could be $1.5 mil-
lion, a valuable addition to the com-
pany’s copper and gold earnings.
A key factor in determining prospects
for real growth in the pyrites industry
will be the results of metallurgical re-
search being conducted throughout the
world. The discovery of a process
whereby elemental sulphur could be
separated from other pyritic material at
the mine site could eliminate the freight
disadvantage and extra costs incurred
in acid manufacture from pyrites com-
pared with brimstone.

Cocoa at a Ceiling?
THE price of cocoa appears to have
reached a ceiling around £stg.26o
a ton after rising £3O in two
months. The halt to the rise was due
partly to some downward revisions in
estimates of chocolate consumption.
The U.S. fourth-quarter cocoa grind-
ings were 1.8 percent lower than in the
last quarter of 1965, and this slowed
the year’s rise to 3 percent. Also, the
present price is near the level at which
chocolate producers cut their pur-
chases.
For the present, then, speculators’
hopes of £240 a ton price seems to have
been dashed. The present levels are his-
torically quite high and are far above
the depressed levels of eighteen months
ago.
The range of cocoa prices in London
last year was £152 to £216 a ton. In
1965 the low was £l2O a ton. The
slump in 1965 hit not only producers
but chocolate companies, whose stock
values fell, bringing down profits.
In the longer term the producers’
main problem will probably be keeping
consumers supplied. In the shorter
term there could be a downward move,
depending on the speculators and
Ghana’s harvest figures.
RECENT talk of a 50 cents an ounce
rise in the price of silver is not
well supported by facts. At pres-
ent the U.S. Treasury sells silver to all
takers at $U.5.1.29 an ounce, to pro-
tect the old silver-based coinage from
being melted down. As stocks of the
new cupro-nickel U.S. coinage build
up, the need for this protection will
disappear.
On present indications, silver prices
could rise within a year, although the
Treasury says its stocks of silver could
last many years at expected rates of
sale and that it has no plans to stop
selling. When silver prices do begin to
rise, the vast quantity of silver coins
available will dampen the market.
Most U.S. producers (who would
naturally wish to see as large a rise as
possible) forecast that silver will not
rise above about $1.40 an ounce. This
is borne out by the large-scale buying in
recent months of silver for future de-
livery at average prices up to $1.35 an
ounce.
U.S. aluminium producers finally
made the move to raise the metal’s
price last week. The industry has
been complaining about low profit mar-
gins for some time, but a previous
attempt to raise prices a |-cent boost
in November, 1965 was successfully
opposed by the U.S. Administration.
The latest lift has so far met only
token resistance from the Government.
While most producers moved their
quotes 1 cent to 25J cents a lb., Alcoa,
the industry giant, was content with a
i-cent increase. The rises in prices of
semi-fabricated products were 1J cents
and 1 cent a lb. respectively.
As a large proportion of aluminium
metal and mill products sells at dis-
counts on the official price, the value
of the moves depends on how rigidly
the whole price structure follows suit.

By JASON in Sydney
THERE’S no getting away from it;
most of the coming batch of
interim reports are not going to
be very bright. Most will probably talk
of a fairly dreary first half-year and
then speak more hopefully of the
second half. Unless the stock market is
confident enough to choose to have
faith in directors’ forecasts, the news of
poorer first-half profits could take a bit
of the gloss off the recent market
recovery.
No matter how cheering the 25-point
market advance of recent months may
be, it could come under a little pres-
sure in the traditionally tough period
of early March. Not even the lower
rates likely to be offered on short- and
medium-term bonds in the February
Commonwealth loan should do much
for the market; this will merely be
confirmation of the trend already set
in motion by the 0.40 percent drop in
short bond yields, the 0.14 percent in
ten-year bonds in the market, and the
0.32 percent cut in Treasury Note
yields on December 28.
On the other hand, ihere is not likely
to be the same sort of squeeze on
liquidity this March as in the past few
years, as the authorities seem very keen
to keep the system well stocked up with
cash even if it is not being spent.
So a mixture of cash and confidence
(and the hope that the market could
be in the 350 s by November) could
hold the market firm against some
unimpressive company reports.
Certainly there will be some good
interims; there was nothing wrong with
last week’s ACI and Carlton and United
interims (except for the dull way the
market responded to them; both are
still at bargain prices and should not
be left out of any “recovery” portfolio),
And things look pretty good in the
fertiliser business, judging from
Cresco’s bonus. But then so they should,
as the end of the drought should have
brought a great improvement to this
sector.
But last weekend’s interim report
from Brambles Industries seems more
likely to set the pattern for the next
couple of months. It showed quite
clearly that things were very difficult
in the early parts of 1966-67, but that
earnings improved significantly later in
the -first half, so much so that “if a
similar trend continues for the full
financial year,” then profit should “corn-
pare favorably” with 1965-66. The pros-
pects are that the trend will be main-
tained, and that Brambles will prove a
worthwhile recovery proposition for
those investors who bought on our
advice at $1.47 back in October and
who were showing a ten percent profit
by the weekend.
In any event, the lower interim profit
still left the company in a sound position
with an annual earning rate of 22.3 per-
cent on capital (against the 27.3 per-
cent for the same half -of last year on
lower capital) and quite comfortably
covers the steady 15 percent annual
dividend rate. But there is no doubt
that the first half was bad for Brambles
possibly even worse in a trading
sense than the interim suggests. For
it does not separate Brambles’ trading
profits from its investment income, and
it seems likely that investment income
may well have increased substantially
(due to a higher dividend from its 50
percent holding in the steel slag
recovery company Breckett).
So the pre-tax drop of 17 percent may
give a better idea of the difficult trading
for Brambles than the 8.1 percent drop
in net profit. For the net figure benefited
from a $200,000 reduction in tax, due
in part to the $340,000 rise in depreci-
ation, but also, presumably, to the pos-
sibility that tax-free investment income
made up a greater proportion of the
profit. This depreciation rise was on
“substantial additions” to plant and
equipment, which was not fully utilised
in the period, particularly in new areas
of business. So it is evident that full
use of these additions in the second
half would bring considerable benefits.
ALTHOUGH the big rise in price
of the beach miners who now
prefer to be known as mineral
sands miners—during the past week was
inspired by the sudden and sharp in-
creases in the titanium and rutile
strategic stockpiles in the U.S.; in fact,
the greatest bull point for these miners
is in the longer-term growth of use of
titanium in industry. Mainly due to the
remarkable technical advances in the
ability to use titanium brought about
by research for the U.S. supersonic air-
craft program (particularly at Lock-
heed, which has lost the battle with
Boeing for the right to make the SST),
titanium is now being forged, rolled,
machined, welded, electro-chemically
machined and, as “The Economist” puts
it, “generally bashed about” in a way
and on such a scale that seemed im-
possible a year or so ago.
“The Economist” reports: “Whereas
Lockheed and Boeing first chose titan-
ium only because it stayed strong £t the
. temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit
set up in supersonic flight, Lockheed,
for one, now uses it in subsonic aircraft
that may never get hot but can do with

The Chartist says:
UNITED URANIUM could be well worth considering by short to medium
term investors. The chart, which has been reproduced back to 1961, shows
a general sideways movement around the 50c level until the sharp decline
in 1965. Since the low point of 18c, the stock has followed an uptrend at a basic
rate of 100 percent appreciation per annum and has recently broken out of a
consolidation pattern where a high of 75c was recorded on 16/1/67 on very heavy
volume. This rise broke the resistance level of the 1965 high point of 70c and a
short to medium term objective of approximately $l.OO-$ 1.10 would be possible,
where the situation would call for reassessment. Last sale price on 17/1/67 -72 c.

tralia, could be the cheapest way of
getting in on the act, but bigger com-
panies like Associated and Wyong Min-
erals in the Consolidated Goldfields
stable, Peko-Wailsend and Kathleen In-
vestments (which share the ownership
of Rutile and Zircon Mines at New-
castle), and Western Titanium may
have more to gain. This is despite the
development of deposits in Sierra Leone,
which will shortly diminish the dom-
inant role of Australia as producer of
95 percent of the world’s rutile.
Second Market
PAYING half brokerage rates is
always an attractive proposition,
particularly for speculators who
are looking for a quick turn and now
have to earn large paper profits before
they can be converted into even modest
real ones because of the high cost
of buying and selling shares. But for
institutional investors, who are buying
to hold rather than to trade, the most
important thing is to buy at the right
price, even if brokerage is high, rather
than_to get a cut-price brokerage deal
when the shares themselves are at the
wrong price.
So the cut-rate brokerage attractions
of the new Second Market Pty. Ltd.,
which set up shop last week, may not
be as great to the institutions as they
should seem on the surface; the basic
price at which the shares are being
offered should remain the key to doing
business with these bigger buyers (and
sellers).
And it would take a long time before
the big lines of supply and the large
scope for placement now available
through members of the stock exchanges
would apply to the Second Market
if ever. For there is not even much
chance that the big investment bankers
like Darlings, DFC, and AUC would
operate through the Second Market.
Apart from the strong links, some, like
AUC, have with stockbrokers, there is
a simple commercial reason (in recip-
rocal deals) why these bankers should
do much of their trading through
brokers. For instance, Darlings sell an
investment service to brokers, so it is
wise to give its customers some broking
business; DFC gets some business for
its Fixed Trusts through brokers, so
it is wise for the Fixed Trusts to
operate through these brokers, and so
on.
The separation of Darling and Co.
from Sydney brokers Ord Minnett that
was revealed by “The Australian” news-
paper last week (and also the departure
of Binder Hamlyn as a Darling share-
holder) is not likely to change Darling’s
enthusiasm for using stockbrokers as
this sort of quid pro quo (even if it
could be argued that this means mer-
chant banks are making their cus-
tomers bear the costs of deals for which
the merchant banks themselves get a
reciprocal pay-off).
However, the new smaller merchant
bankers now setting up (two former
non-member partners of Sydney Stock
Exchange firms are the latest to set up
shop) may find the Second Market’s
facilities useful. But, so far, its uses
seem limited. Its backers are Dr. M. D.
Garretty, the Trendex and stock options
man, and Mr. Leo Wall, the former boss
of Australian Equity Corporation, that
is now a CAGA subsidiary. Interestingly
enough, its Melbourne manager is Mr.
Peter Dunlop, who was formerly with
Melbourne stockbroker Mr. Frank
Irving, one of the most accomplished
“big deals” men in the market.

Fair Prospects under Par
By PELIAS in Melbourne
EVERYONE is talking about a
stock-market recovery this year
and stockbrokers (and investment
survey companies) are sending out their
lists of most favored stocks for 1967,
generally including plenty of highly
priced stocks like BHP, CGFA, RTZ,
and so on. But if this recovery does
take place for industrial shares, one
group that should provide the greatest
percentage rises is made up of those
stocks that are under par and yet have
fair prospects of doing moderately well.
Two such companies are in the tea and
coffee business.
ALTHOUGH the jprice of its shares
has already jumped now that the
Kenyan Land Board has approved
the sale of East African Coffee Plan-
tations’ Kiamara coffee estate, the large
number of buyers and a shortage of
sellers suggest some further rises are
still to come.
After the announcement of the Land
Board’s approval last week, there were
seven buyers (in one of the infamous
operators’ “clubs”?) offering 36 cents
for each of the $1 shares but not a seller
to be found. Previous sales had been at
34 cents. One buyer broke from the
barrier next day and offered 40 cents.
Even this price attracted no sellers and
the bid had to be taken to 43 cents
before a sale could be made. By last
Thursday, there had been sales at 47
cents. So, in four days, the price had
risen by almost 40 percent.
The jump was warranted. Any in-
vestor who can acquire a parcel for less
than 50 cents stands a good chance of
doubling his money by the end of this
year. The returns from the sale alone
are worth 29 cents for each of the
shares and the company’s prospects are
now brighter than they have been for
some time.
Directors have predicted an early
return to the dividend lists once their
sale was approved, which in theory
means the shares must soon fetch par,
or close to it. The sale heralds the end
of the group’s liquidity problems and
the severe profit fluctuations which have
been brought about by its inability to
cope with the dreaded coffee berry
disease. Production is now centred on
tea from the Kepchomo and Savani
estates both of which are believed
to have scored substantial boosts to out-
put so far in the current year. A few
hundred acres of coffee plants are still
being maintained at minimum expense,
so the group can leap back into produc-
tion quickly if a cure is found for the
disease.
Apart from the profit boost expected
in the current year from higher tea
production, results for the final half
should get additional benefits from the
initial operation of the new tea factory
at Savani. The factory was built last
year and should already be processing
leaf for the company.
The real growth will come in 1967-
68, however (the company balances on
May 31). This will be the group’s first
full year free from the worries of coffee
berry disease, liquidity problems, and
the interest bill on bank overdraft.
Further boosts to tea production will be
planned, as the group appears to be
having very little trouble in selling all
its output.
THERE seems little reason for the
$1 shares in Griffiths Brothers,
the tea and coffee merchant, to
be below par. At current prices of 88
cents they yield an enticing 9.1 percent
from the adequately covered dividend
after brokerage. For several years now
the group has been extricating itself
from earlier difficulties through exten-
sive reorganisation and some reconstruc-
tion. The full benefits of this are ex-
pected to show up in the accounts for
the first time this year. There was some
evidence of the board’s endeavors in
the 1965-66 accounts profit doubled
to return 10.9 percent on capital and
provide a cover for the steady 8 per-
cent dividend.
As well as its interests in tea and
coffee merchandising, there are assets-
tied up in the South Australian trans-
port industry. Last year these suffered

from reduced activity in the building
industry and less fertiliser haulage be-
cause of a strike. Both these factors
should reverse themselves in the cur-
rent year and add handsomely to pro-
fits. Strong demand has continued this
year for the company’s brands of tea
and coffee. In addition these interests
have been expanded over the past two
years by cash acquisitions which are
adding to profits without increasing the
amount of capital to be serviced. This
is one virtue (for shareholders) of hav-
ing the scrip below par.
The improvement and expansion are
adding to the returns on capital, and
even the 1965-66 earning rate, dividend,
and asset backing at balance date
($1.51) warrant a higher price than that
ruling on the market at present. Per-
haps buyers will display a little more
confidence after the March report.
ANOTHER “below par” company
that appeals is Lawrence and
Hanson, electrical engineer and
contractor. The $1 shares are at 91
cents. In the 1966 calendar year they
varied between $1.50 and 72 cents.
The big drop was a reflection of the
company’s 1965-66 earning rate, halved
to 12.6 percent. One reason for the
drop was the need to service capital
increased by a one-for-four issue with
a steady 8 percent dividend. Another
was difficult trading brought about by
the drought, the lower rate of build-
ing and the smaller yields for sugar
and tobacco in North Queensland.
There were also increased expenses, a
large portion of which arose from the
introduction of data processing and the
centralising of service accounts.
Most of these factors should revert
to play in the company’s favor this
year. Not the least important will be
a greater degree of management control
and some of cost saving. Sales were re-
ported higher in the first four months
the full year will benefit from an
initial full 12 months trading by
several new branches opened in 1965-66.
These factors make the shares worth
buying at any figure below par. While
waiting for benefits, there will be the
comfort of a $1.85 asset backing (twice
market price) and a considerable in-
come flowing from the current 8.8 per-
cent dividend yield.
LAST week’s jump in M. B. John &
Hattersley’s shares was mainly due
to the South Australian announce-
ment that a gas pipeline from Gidge-
alpa to Adelaide could well be under
construction by the end of the year. So
shareholders are already receiving the
benefits of the large increase in busi-
ness which the oil and natural gas in-
dustries are expected to bring to the
company over the next few years. The
group makes a wide range of valves
in its own right, and has only recently
specialised in valves for these industries
through a licence from a Houston
(Texas) group.
Apart from pipe manufacturers, its
move has probably placed it at the top
of the list of companies which are
going to benefit from servicing Aus-
tralia’s oil and gas discoveries. Last
week’s market reaction makes one won-
der what the shares will do when the
Melbourne-Gippsland line gets under
way and go-ahead signs are given for
other lines which may serve Sydney,
Wollongong, Newcastle, Brisbane, and
Pertht All these plans add up to a lot
of valves.
At $2.92 the shares are already well
above the $2.65 level ruling a few
weeks ago and, as many of these pipe-
line plans are both up in the air and
not likely to come off in the immediate
future, any investment should only be
considered on a long-term basis. The
group is solid and long-term share-
holders should not find themselves short
of capital gains. Operations through-
out Australia have made it the nation’s
largest valve manufacturer, with annual
sales currently in excess of $l2 million.
The one-for-four bonus of 1962-63
cut earning rate to 15.8 percent, but it
was 23 percent by 1964-65 and was al-
most maintained last year after a one-
for-ten cash issue. N.S.W. and Queens-
land sales should have picked up this
year after the drought and, as each
company in the group has a plan of
expansion, profits should go on rising
for several years, even without pipelines.

now available. Copies may be ordered

THE CHARTIST SAYS:
Avoid the Fallen Idols
FOR his latest group the Security Analyst took five lead-
ing companies whose share prices had “fallen more
than 30 percent from their high point of 1966.” He
regarded this as a “fair fall,” since the 1966 drop in the
Sydney all-ordinaries index was 8J percent. The group
comprised: Boral (8., Dec. 10), Commonwealth Industrial
Gases (Dec. 17), Dunlop Rubber (Dec. 24), Grace Bros.
(Dec. 31), and Minster (Jan. 7). In general, Security
sounded rather more cheerful than the evidence from the
charts suggests. He found Boral undervalued and indicated
$2.10 as a suitable price. Of CIG he concluded that “the
most optimistic forecast only suggests a return to the
earning rate levels of 1959-62.” Dunlop’s shares “are still
well priced, since they are selling at 13| times 1965-66
earnings, which are after a low tax provision.” Grace Bros,
“would not be overpriced up to a level of $2.00 a share.”
Minster, also, Security believed, had been “marked down too
heavily,” indicating $3.20 as a satisfactory value. Trends
from the charts do not support these conclusions.
There must be many disillusioned investors still holding
the “fallen idols” under review and the charts must surely
illustrate the value and significance of well-established trend-
lines. Severe erosion of capital would have been avoided
simply by selling on the break in trend. Dividends
must be poor compensation for invstors, particularly those
who bought near the top in 1964. At the present time
there would be no significant technical reason to buy any
of these stocks, due to the absence of clear base patterns.
Basically, the stocks are still in downtrends and could not
be recommended 7 at present. Their movements can be
directly compared with the performance of the all-ordinaries
index since 1960.
BORAL: The overall performance of this stock since
1960 must be disappointing to long-term holders, as even
investors who bought near the “bottom” in 1960 would have
only dividends to show for their patience. A clear selling
signal was given about $3 on the break in the uptrend,
which had continued at approximately 20 percent per
annum until the top formation in 1964. A low of $1.59 was
recorded in October, 1966, and prices have since rallied to
$2.01. The stock could still be regarded as in a major down-
trend; if prices hold above the $l.BO level over the next
few months, this could be an indication that a head-and-
shoulders base reversal pattern was forming. However, any
penetration below the $1.60 support level could lead to a
further decline to an extreme pessimistic target of approxi-
mately.sl. Last sale price on 13/1/67 $2.
CIG must also be a depressing sight to long-term
holders of this market leader. The fall below $3.20 at the
beginning of 1966 and penetration of the lower uptrend line
issued a warning that a strong downtrend was about to
commence after the overall sideways movement from 1960
to 1964. Investors could expect the decline to continue to
approximately $1.70-$l.BO levels. There are no support
levels in the present trading range back to 1960 and this
stock should be avoided at present prices of $2.52. Last
sale price on 13/1/67 $2.25.
DUNLOP is an excellent example of the value of trend-
lines and investors who sold on the break in trend in 1964
would have avoided severe erosion of capital. The uptrend
which commenced at the beginning of 1962 moved in a
narrow trend channel at a rate of approximately 35 percent
appreciation per annum until the head-and-shoulders top
formation late in 1964. A selling signal was indicated on the
break in trend about the $2.20 level and the following down-
trend took prices to a low of $1.14 in September, 1966. It
is quite likely that prices could rise to between $1.45 and
$1.50 in the short term and this would “test” the major
downtrend line. However, it is too early to say that Dunlop
has based and a serious decline could follow any break of
the support level at $1.14, but the range of trading which
took place in 1961 would bring fairly strong support for
the stock about the $1 level. Last sale price on 13/1/67
$1.23.
GRACE BROS, followed a 20 percent uptrend after listing
late in 1960 until the top formation and break trend at the
beginning of 1965, when prices fell sharply to $1.48. The
stock formed a promising uptrend until May, 1966, and
once again a sharp decline followed and a low point of
$1.28 was recorded recently. A reaction has since taken prices
back to $1.78 and at this point would “test” the major
downtrend line. There is certainly no technical reason to
buy Grace Bros, at present, as a renewal of the decline is
more likely in the short term and prices could be expected
to recede to at least the $1.30 level again with an even more
pessimistic target of $l.lO. Last sale price on 13/1/67 —$1.65.
MINSTER: Investors who sold toward the end of 1964
on the break of the steep intermediate uptrend and even
the lower 15 percent uptrend line held since 1961 would
have avoided the severe decline which took prices to a low
point of $2.15 in November, 1966. This could well be the
end of the downtrend and a rally has since taken prices
back to $3.05. However, a long period of consolidation and
wide fluctuations would be more likely for this stock and
prices will most probably recede toward the base level.
There would certainly be no technical reason to buy at
present, as a strong downtrend with recessive tendencies still
exists. Any penetration of the support level at $2.15 would
mean a resumption of the downtrend, but for the time being
there are no further targets in sight. Last sale price on
13/1/67 $2.88.

SEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Revival for Aust. Gypsum
WHEN British Plaster Board Hold-
ings Ltd. of the U.K. sold its
10. percent shareholding in Aus-
tralian Gypsum Industries last month
(it has retained 50,000 shares and its
technical agreements), the reason given
was that Britain’s “economic restric-
tions” had forced the sale, not that there
was any dissatisfaction with the invest-
ment in the Australian But
if Australian Gypsum had been a more
lively and rewarding investment, per-
haps the British may have been able to
avoid the sale.
'There is little doubt that the invest-
ment had been a very dull one indeed;
the one million shares allotted to BPB
in May, 1961, at 20 cents under the
market of $1.40 were placed with Aus-
tralian institutions last month at only
$1.33. In terms of open market price,
there has not been an ounce of growth
in the company for the past six years,
despite a lift in dividend from 10 per-
cent to 12£ percent in this period.
So the market has changed its mind
about Australian Gypsum since 1962
even though its dividend rate has risen
by one quarter, its earning rate has
gone up by almost one-third in steady
advances (except for last year’s down-
turn), and over the past five years the
company has spent about $6 million
of cash flow on its assets at the same
time as it has paid out only about
$3.2 million in dividends. Thus the
company should be worth more and
ought to be able to earn much more
than five years ago. Its fixed assets are
now written down in the books to half
their cost or valuation of $13.3 million.
Is the market right or will this year’s
promised stock market recovery carry
Australian Gypsum back to the old
price earnings ratios near the 20 mark
instead of the current 13.7 times?
To a large extent it will depend
on the company itself. On last year’s
performance, its present PE ratio looks
quite large enough, especially as there
has been no capital growth, no issues
of any kind ever since the company was
formed in 1960-61. y
There are reasonable prospects of the
company doing better this year follow-
ing, last year’s 8 percent fall in net profit
on steady sales, and, if so, the price
should rise. The recovery in the hous-
ing industry now under way should
bring some benefits to the compiany,
but the threat of a downturn in office
buildings could cloud this picture. In
any event, the congratulatory note in
last year’s annual report about the
company maintaining its sales despite
a 10 percent fall in approvals for the
erection of new homes rings fairly
hollow. Plaster is one of the last items
to go into a house, so it seems that
‘Housing completions look the more
appropriate figure to use and last
year these were exactly steady. This
infers that 1965-66’s 10 percent down-
turn in approyals (which relates to the
use of plaster several months ahead)
could have its effect on business in the
early months of 1966-67. But better
times later should more than offset this
problem.
The company should soon begin to
.benefit from the considerable , expan-
sion of the past two years, even though
most of it seems to have been in buying
land and buildings rather than installing
new plant. In the past two years, the
gross value of freehold land and build-
ings has jumped by one million dollars
to $5.8 million, while the cost of plant
installed has gone up by $740,000 to
$7.5 million.
NEVERTHELESS, the company does
need cash. At 1966 balance date,
Australian Gypsum had capital com-
mitments not provided for in the
accounts of - almost $1.5m., compared
with a mere $258,000 in 1965. This is
for general plant improvements and a
new head office building in Latrobe
Street, Melbourne.
The quietness of the building indus-
try has probably sharpened competition
for the plaster makers. CSR, the main
rival (though there are a few other
much smaller competitors), proposes to
build a new plaster mill in Melbourne
at Yarraville, as its Brunwick mill is
now too small. CSR matches Australian
Gypsum’s mills in Melbourne, Sydney,
Brisbane, and Adelaide, but only GSR
has a mill in Perth. Likewise both com-
panies Mve plasterboard plants in Mel-
bourne, Sydney, and Adelaide, but CSR
only is represented in Brisbane.
Stocks and stores and contracts' in
progress were more or less static at
$2.1m., but trade debtors rose 24 percent
in 1965-66 to $3,169,000, although sales
(never divulged) were just maintained.
This is a fair measure of the present
liquidity of customers in the building
industry, who are taking up to 90 days
to pay instead of the usual 30. Yet
Australian Gypsum, to its credit, re-
duced its trade creditors slightly. The
debtors’ figure is after providing doubt-
ful debts of about ,11 percent; firms can
get a big knock from orte account in
the building industry, and the conser-
vative management would like to see
this high provision, even higher.
Tax provision in 1963-64 was rather
generous in relation to declared profits,
and in the 1964-65 accounts the com-
pany got a windfall of $254,000 refund
in respect of 1952-63.
Now that the new plants have run
in, and provided building Conditions im-
prove, Australian Gypsum’s profits
should revive. The shares at $1.40,
yielding 4.5 percent in income and 7.3
percent on earnings, give solid, if un-
spectacular, value. The 1,100,000 50c
shares. which BPB Industries disposed
of in December, 1966, are unlikely to
dampen any recovery in this stock* as
they were taken up by local institutions
which appear to be likely to hold them.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
One or two spells of extremely sedate dealings left the indus-
trial market practically steady on the week; BHP, of course,
had much to do with the overall index position, finishing as
it did 4 cents down at $6.50. A few industrials put on notable
gains: Thiess, for instance, adding 17 cents to reach $1.23 and
the seldom traded Australian Fertilisers 33 cents to $4.43,
Awaiting the report, Henry Jones moved up 8 cents to $4.10,
while Commonwealth Industrial Gases recovered 14 cents to
close at $2.39. Among miners, King Island Scheelite dropped
1 cent to $3.22 and Western Mining 6 cents to $6.76.

Chess Bulletin
MIKHAIL BOTVINNIK
Mikhail botvinnik was
{ champion chess player of
the world from 1948 to
1963, except for two one-year in-
tervals when he handed over his
mantle temporarily to Vassily
Smyslov and then Mikhail Tal.
Having reached the age of fifty-
five, it appears that he has given
up all thoughts of further world
championship play. This does not
mean, however, that he has for-
saken the field of chess or, for
that matter, top-level tourna-
ment play.
It was not many months ago
that he won first place in a
small international tournament
at Amsterdam. Only two weeks
ago he again took first place in
an international tournament.
This was at the Hastings Premier
Tournament, where he finished a
full point ahead of Grandmaster
Uhlmann, of East Germany.
The most interesting aspect of
this year’s Hastings Tournament
was the fact that, of the field of
ten, five at least were juniors.
The juniors consisted of World
Junior Champion, Bojan Kura-
jaica (19), champion of Brazil,
14-year-old Enrique Mecking,
exciting recent Soviet discovery
18-year-old Yuri Balashov, and
the two English juniors, William
Hartston (19) and Raymond
Keene (18). What a tremendous
future must be in store for young
Mecking, who came seventh' in
such company.
Here are the full results: Botvinnik
6s; Uhlmann 51; Balashov, Basman
and Kurajalca 5; Penrose 4J; Meck-
ing 4; Keene 3i; Czerniak and Hart-
ston 3.
This week’s game shows Botvinnik
in devastating form, against Hungarian
Grandmaster Szabo during the 1.8. M.
(Amsterdam) tournament" last year.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Not with the Use of a Pin
WITH only two months of the
financial year gone, the value of
the portfolio is up 20 percent.
This is not much less than the earning
rate for the whole of the preceding
year. Mind you, the market has had a
smart rise since November—even the
use of a pin in selecting stocks would
have paid off handsomely.
The mining market, with its King
Island Scheelites and Mount Morgans,
has provided the thrills. Nevertheless,
the industrial market has recorded
some worthwhile riseil, too. As a share-
holder of L. J. Hooker I’m particularly
conscious of the performance of that
company. From a possible loss position
of $l5O at the end of November, I’m
now facing the prospect of a $126
profit. I turned the prospect into reality
by selling at 39 cents.
Heartened by the market responses
to some of my recent mining invest-
ments, I decided to take the plunge
into Kathleen Investments at $2.96. On
fundamental reasons the stock is prob-
ably overpriced. This sober fact seems
to have no bearing on the market.
Although the proposed visit to Australia
by a team of Japanese uranium experts
has been known for months, their
arrival in this country sparked off a
rush on uranium stocks. Kathleen
Investments responded by a 20 cent rise
to $3 and has now reacted back to
$2.95.
'J'HE Japanese team is anxious to par-
ticipate in the development of some
of our uranium deposits. It’s on the
cards that Kathleen Investments is
equally anxious to find a partner to
finance the development of its uranium
deposits in the SKAL lease and the
Anderson Lode. After all, Kathleen’s
own funds are fairly heavily committed
in iron ore, beach sands, and tin. If an
agreement was announced, it could put
Kathleen shares up to $3.50.
Rightly or wrongly, I regard the
mining market and its galloping prices
with considerable caution. So it is that
I generally try to balance the portfolio
with industrial investments. This week
it was Marrickville Holdings Ltd.
Despite the efforts of Mrs. Jones,
Marrickville shares took quite a batter-
ing last year. For years, Marrickville
has been exceeding its margarine quota,
yet it was not until November that the
N.S.W. Government decided to rigidly
enforce the quota system. Although a
temporary victory for the dairy farmers,
the fight is not yet over. The margarine
quota system is to be reviewed by the
Agricultural Council next month. If the
quota system is to be liberalised, then
best be in Marrickville shares now.
Of course, all is not lost if there is
no change in the quota system. Mar-
rickville Holdings will continue to do
very well out of its range of ETA food
products and its several other interests.

Where Can
FUJI Electric Help?
iH*
Looking at the ambitious develop-
ment programs being carried out in
Australia, we keep asking this ques-
tion. And the answer keeps coming
back in the form of orders —from
government, from industry, and
from a multitude of private citizens.
It seems that they've all discovered
that where electricity needs to be
generated, transmitted, distributed
or put to work, Fuji Electric usually
has a more economical, more ef-
ficient way to do it.
The man in the street and his wife
are probably most familiar with
Fuji’s fine line of home appliances
which have made their daily lives
so much more pleasant, healthy
and efficient. Washing machines and
vacuum cleaners take the drudgery
out of cleaning, while TV sets, stereo
equipment and transistor radios give
new sparkle and vigor to recreation.
Our proudest accomplishment has
been showing thousands of fam-
ilies how fresh-squeezed fruit and
vegetable juices can set the founda-
tion for true health and stamina .. .
especially when the juices are scien-
tifically extracted with a Fuji Juicer.
But leaders in government and
industry know how Fuji Electric can
help and has helped in many ways
that are fundamental to Australia’s
long-term development. The first
contribution was made in the 950
KW Pelton-type turbine and genera-
tor which was delivered to the Snowy
Mountains Authority in 1964. Other
important projects to which Fuji has
contributed, or will contribute, in-
clude the Para Substation, the
Lemonthyme Power Station, and the
Wilmot Power Station.
Where can Fuji Electric help?
In components, in appliances, in
equipment, in complete systems
for the generation, transmission and
utilization of electricity.
