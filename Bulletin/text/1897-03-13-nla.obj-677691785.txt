Ifowrfay.—This new creature with the long hair is a
good deal in the way. It is always hanging around and
follow,ng me about. I don't like this ; I an, not used to
eompany. I wish it would stay with the other animals.
. • . Gloudy to-day, wind in the east; think we shall have
ram. ... We? Where did I get that word?. .. I
remember now—the new creature uses it.
Tuasdmy— Been looking over the estate. The new
creature calls it the * Garden of Eden ’—why, I am sure I
do not know. Says it looks like the Gard n of Eden,
That is not a reason, it is mere waywardness and imbe-
«hty. I get no chance to name anything myself. The
new creature names everything that comes along, before
I can get in a protest.
Wednesday.— Built me a shelter against the rain, but
couia not have it to myself in peace. The new creature
obtruded. When I tried to put it out it shed water out
of the holes in the front of its head that it looks with, and
wiped it away with the back of its paw, and made a
piteous noise such as some of the other animals make
when they are in distress.
Saturday.— The new creature eats too muoh fruit. We
are going to run short, most likely. •We ’ again—that is
its word; mine, too, now, from hearing it so much.
Good deal of fog this morning. Ido not go out in the
fog, myself. The new creature does. It goes out in all
weathers, and stumps right in with its muddy feet. And
talks. It used to be so pleasant and quiet here.
Sunday. -Pulled through. This day is getting to be
more and more trying. It was selected and set apart
last November as a day of rest. I already had six of
them per week before. This is another of those unac-
countable things. There seems to be too much legisla-
tion, too much fussing, and fixing, and tidying-up, and
not enough of the better-let-well-enough-alone policy.
[lfem. —Must keep that sort of opinion to myself.) This
morning found the new creature trying to clod apples
out of that forbidden tree. But it can’t hit anything—it
throws like—that. I think the apples are safe.
* * » »
Monday.— The new creature says its name is Eve. That
is all right, I have no objections. Says it is to call it by
when I want it to come. I said it was superfluous, then.
The word evidently raised me in its respect; and indeed
it is a large, good word and will bear repetition. It says
it is not an It, it is a She. This is probably doubtful; yet
it is all one to me; what she is were nothing to me if she
would but go by herself and keep quiet.
Sunday.—Pulled through.
Monday.— I believe I see what the week is for: it is !•
give time to rest up from the weariness of Sunday. It
Seems a good idea, in a region where good ideas are rather
conspicuously scarce. [Jfem.-Must keep this sort of
remarks private.] . . . She has been climbing that tree
again. Clodded her out of it. She said nobody was
looking. Seems to consider that a sufficient justification
for chancing any dangerous thing. Told her that. The
word justification moved her admiration—and envy, too,
I thought. It is a good word.
Thursday.— She told me she was made out of a rib
taken from my body. This is at least doubtful, if not
more than that. I have not missed any rib. . . . She is
in much trouble about the buzzard ; says grass does not
agree with it; is afraid she can’t raise it; thinks it was
intended to live on decayed flesh. The buzzard must get
along the best it can with what is provided. We cannot
overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard.
Sunday. —Pulled through.
Tuesday. —She has taken up with a snake, now. The
Other animals are glad, for she was always experimenting
with them and bothering them ; and I am glad, because
the snake talks ; and this enables me to get a rest.
Friday.— She says the snake advises her to try the fruit
of that tree, and says the result will be a great and fine
and noble education. I advised her to keep away from
the tree. She said she wouldn’t. I foresee trouble.
Will emigrate.
* * * *
Wednesday. —l have had a variegated time. I escaped
that night, and rnde a horse all night as fast as he could
go, hoping to get clear out of the Garden and hide in some
other country before the trouble should begin ; but it was
not to be. About an hour after sun-up, as I was riding
through a flowery plain where thousands of animals were
grazing, slumbering, or playing with each other, accord-
ing to their common wont, all of a sudden they broke into
a tempest of frightful noises, and in one moment the
plain was a frantic commotion as far as the eye could
reach, and every beast was destroying its neighbor. I
knew what it meant—Eve had eaten that fruit, and death
was come into the world. . . . The tigers ate my horse,
paying uo attention when I ordered them to desist, and
they would even have eaten me if I had stayed—which I
didn't. ... I found this place, outside the Garden,
and was fairly comfortable for a few days, but she has
found me out. ... I find she is a good deal of a com-
panion. I see I should be lonesome and depressed with-
out her, now that I have lost tny property. Another
thing ;,she says it is ordered that we work for our living
hereafter, bhe will be useful. I will superintend.
Ten days later.—She aoouses me of being partly the
cause of our disaster 1 I like that I
* * • •
Next year.—We have named it Cain. She oaueht it
while I was up country trapping ; caught it in the timber
a couple of miles from our dug-out—or it might have
been four, she isn’t certain which. It resembles us in
some ways, and may' be a relation. That is what she
thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment. The differ-
ence in size warrants the conclusion that it is a different
and new kind of animal—a fist), perhaps, though when I
dumped it in the water to see, it sank, and she plunged
in and snatched it out before there was a chance for the
experiment to determine the ma ter.
uunday. fjhe don’t work, Sundays, but lies around all
tired out with her week’s digging and hoeing, and likes
to have the fish wallow over her; and she makes fool
noises to amuse it, and pretends to chew its paws, and
that makes it laugh. I’ve never seen a fish before that
could laugh. This makes me doubt . . . I have come
to like Sunday myself. Superintending all the week tires
a body so. There ought to be more Sundays. In the old
days they were tough, but now they come handy.
H ednesday. It isn’t a fish. I cannot quite make out
what it is. It makes curious devilish noises when not
satisfied ; and when it is, says "goo-goo.” I said I be-
lieved it was an enigma, but she only admired the word
without understanding it. In my judgment it is either
an enigma or some kind of a bug. If it dies, I will
take it apart and examine its works. I never had a
thing perplex me so.
* • • *
Thtee months later. —ft must- have been a young one
when it came, for it has grown exceedingly since. It
must he five times as big now as it was then, and when
discontented is able to make from twenty-two to thirty-
eight times the noise it made at first. She reconciles it by
persuasion, and hy giving it things which she had told it
she wouldn’t give it before. As observed previously, I was
not at home when it first came, and she told me she found
it in the woods. It seems odd that it should be the only
one, yet it must be so, for I have worn myself out these
many weeks trying to find another one to add to my col-
lection, and for this one to play with ; for surelv then it
would be quieter and we could tame it more easily.
Eight months later. —l examined its mouth. There is
no danger yet; it has only one tooth. It hasn’t any tail
yet. It makes more noise now than it ever did before—
and mainly at night. I have moved out But I shall go
over, mornings, to breakfast, and to see if it has more
teeth. If it gets a mouthful of teeth it will be time for
it to go, tail or no tail; for a bear does not need a tail in
order to be dangerous.
Four months later. —I have been off hunting and fishing
a month. Meantime the bear has learned to paddle
around all by itself on its hind legs, and says ‘poppa’
and ‘momma.’ It is certainly a new species. I will go
off on a far expedition among the forests of the north and
make an exhaustive search. There must certainly be
another one somewhere, and this one will be less danger-
ous when it has company of its own species.
Three months later. —lt has been a weary hunt, yet I
have had no success. In the meantime, without stirring
from the home estate, she has caught another one! I
never saw such luck. I might have hunted these woods a
hundred years, I never would have run across that thing.
Three months later. —l have been comparing the new
one with the old one, and it is perfectly plain that they
are the same breed. She calls the new one Abel. I was
going to stuff one of them for my collection, but she is
prejudiced against it for gome reason or other. The new
one is as ugly now as the old one was at first; has the
same sulphur-and-raw-meat complexion, and the same
singular head without any fur on it.
* * • «
Ten years later.— They are boys ; we found it out long
ago. It was their coming in that small, immature shape
that fooled us ;we were not used to it. There are some
girls now. Abel is a good boy, but if Cain had stayed a
bear it would have improved him. After all these years,
I see that I was mistiken about Eve in the beginning; it
is better to live outside the Garden with her than inside
it without her.

Mark has been more spontaneous : the base-
ideas here are trite and conventional : but
there is one fine conception—Adam’s hunt for
another Cain. I’o display that red-earthy person
in the skins, with the club —a hunter familiar with
all that rau or swam or flew—posed by tins new
animal, the first Batiy, a monster unthinkable,
unheard-of; arguing in his slow way that every-
thing else went in batches, and so must this •
and taking his club into the woods to discover
the rest of the tribe this is to associate ideas
which only jump together for one man in a
million.

Sleep is passed over it up it comes fresh°and

day when the call of ‘Time!’ finds the
brain motionless, exhausted; and writer, or
artist, or scientist bitterly yields victory to
the Adversary with the scythe. Yet so few
recognise that there is no force like Youth ; that
the head grows grey within as well as without-

brain stiffening, and shrivelling, and wrinkling,

Mixed Paragraphs .
Acurrent question is whether the book of 'The Sign
of the Cross ’ is cruder, duller, and uglier than the play ;
or vice versa.
S.F, Ar onaut stresses one great objection to the lino-
type—the ugly monotony of its type-faces, ‘round, ex-
pressionless, heavy; suited, perhaps, for the slovenly
work of daily journalism, but painful to the eyes of those
used to chaste typography.’
The photographs included in Gordon and Gotch’s
‘Glimpspsof Australia’ are very well varied; as a rule,
very well executed ; and only moderately well repro-
duced. The photo.-engraver in Australia still, for the
most part, relies on his acids only ; in America and
Europe he has called the wood-engraver to his aid to
heighten his whites and deepen his contrasts and get rid
of the flatness so often seen in reproduced photos. Aus-
tralian illustrative art is way ahead of Australian metal-
engravers—and printers.
Flong: * A Gordon story. Many years ago, when on
the Diamantina River, W.Q., I was one day reading
“Gordon” to the two white stockmen on the run, and
Jack Baker, a half caste from the Adelaide side. None of
the three had heard any of Gordon’s poetry before. As
I closed the book I remarked that the author was reckoned
one of the best riders over fences ever seen in Australia.
No fear, said Jack, “the best rider ever I seed was a
bloke that teached me and a few more boys to ride. He
could ride, and no mistake ; you ought to have seen
him taking a horse up to a jump.” Then Jack for half-
an-hour told the good qualities of “the bloke who
teached me to ride.” Till then Gordon’s name had not
been mentioned, but as I was putting the poems on the
shelf I said: “Well, Jack, your boss might have been a
good rider, but Gordon was admitted by everyone to "
What! ’ said Jack, “what did you call him?” “Gor-
don—Lindsay Gordon.” “Why, that’s the very bloke I
was talking about," said Jack. He took the book from
the shelf, I ot ed at it, turned over a few leaves, and said :
“Did Mr. Gordon write all this book?” “Yes, cer-
tainly.” How his eyesdid shine 1 If Gordon ever had a
genuine admirer it is Jack Baker, half-caste, a really
splendid rider and one of the whitest men I ever met.’
Maxillus: ‘The sea appeals to me like a woman. It
smiles and dimples; the little waves, like fingers, run
lightly and caressingly up the shore. The gentle rustle,
the very shimmering of the sun upon its surface, have a
silken suggestion, as of some dainty toilette.’
S. F. Argonaut of Jan. 18 prints ‘ Clancy of the Over-
flow, and acknowledges to Washington Post. These
Vdses were originally written for The Bulletin of 21st
Dec., 1889, by A. B. Paterson, ‘ The Banjo.’ No doubt
When the Argonaut is apprised of the facts it will credit
authorship where it is due.
Sat. Review : ‘ Mr. J. F. Sullivan is one of that large
class of gifted people who sit in the shadow of a first
success.’
Mrs. Crawford: ‘ Sainte-Beuve was a 9andy-haired man
with a phenomenally thin beard and rather swinish
cheeks. He had a pair of small, blue, shrewd, scrutinising
eyes, in which there was a deal of mental expression, but
no other. Not a gleam of sentiment ever passed over the
face. He liked his food, his wine, and an educated female
(I won t say woman)os a t6te-4-t6te in a restaurant. There
could have been no more selfish man. His pleasures were
so purely cerebral as to make him not companionable
except with men as clever as himself. He was also a book-
worm, and liked a silent, solitary house.*
Bushwoman: ‘ Ethel Turner’s pretty verses about the
sea almost persuade me to be a Christian to her in the
mnter of those bullocks in “Seven Little Australians.”
When our teams do twelve miles a day over average
country the men's oaths are comparatively mild- but
hers seemingly think nothing of a 40-mile trip. A dozen
of them start in the morning with a picnic-party for a
nice place 14 miles away, then go on six miles farther for
a >ig tree, and return to “ bring the children back in the
cool of the evening.” Please leave a little space here for
the remarks of Bill and Jim.’
P. : ‘I find everyone trying to read Morris’s “Earthly
Paradise,” and no one can do it. Spenser diluted. Here
are the gases of oxygen and hydrogen without the need-
ful ehctric spark to turn them into the water of life.
Morris's flitting lovely spectres have no flesh and blood.’
D.F. : ‘The Whitman influence is waxing. Clarion
Blatchford is making the good grey poet almost a watch-
word ; several members of Eng. Labor-party are pro-
foundly influenced by him, and show it in their speeches
and w ritings ; he is being 1< aniedly discussed in French,
German, and Russian journals; there is a Japanese cult
of him ; and Me]b, Unitarian pulpit recites him.’
C. : ‘J. B. O'Hara sings of February as “the first
strong child of Autumn born.” The demi-semi-poet is
mixed in his seasons. Kendall knew- better, who called
Mouthll. “the bright-haired, blue-eyed last of Summer.”’
P. . Stead is understood to he wording on a Twopenny
Bible, leaving the warm parts in extenso, and exnnceine
all the dry dogma.’
Sat. Rbvikw : ‘There is, probably, no living man of
position so utterly devoid of the literary instinct’ [a*
Gladstone] ‘ and when he takes up the latest book of the
Humphry Ward or Kailyard school and booms it, the
judicious can only wince and pray for deliverance. His
own works, as literature, are simply beneath criticism.’
BLIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His strife for daily bread died with the day:
Where’er his mood then led he’d wend his way.
With night his note to City’s hum would cease;
Far from men’s haunts he'd go in search of pea.
By rippling waves dancing o'er sandy bars,
He’d walk alone and gaze up at the stars.
There came a night when sea-birds heard a wail.
As of a human heart in sore travail.
Borne on swift wings, a soul-revealing mood
Had flashed on him his own drear solitude.
Amid the circling waters could be seen
Those stars above with all their silv’ry sheen.

Old-Time Lyrics.
THE INDIFFERENT.
If from the lustre of the sun,
To catch your fleeting shade you raa.
In vain is alt your haste. Sir;
But if your feet reverse the race,
The fugitive will urge the chase,
And follow you as fast, Sir.
Thus, if at any time, as new,
Some scornful Chloe you pursue,
In hopes to overtake her;
Be sure you ne’er t ,o eager be,
But look upon’t as cold as sire,
And seemingly forsake her.
So I and Laura, t’other day,
Weie coursing round a cock of hay,
While I oould ne'er o’er get her;
But, when I found I ran in vain,
Quite tir’d I turn'd me back again,
And, flying from her, met her.
W. Pattison
A WARNING FOR WOOERS.
Some love for wealth and some for huet
And none of both these loves are true;
For when the mill hath lost her sailed
Then must the miller lose his vailes:
Of grass comes hay,
And flowers faire will soon decay:
Of ripe comes rottot^
In age all beautie is forgotten.
Some love too high and some too
And of them both great griefs do growth
And some do love the common sort.
And common folk use common sport.
Look not too high,
Lest that a chip fall in thine eye:
But high or lowe,
Te may be sure she is a shrewe.
But, sirs, I use to tell no tales,
Each fish that swims doth not bear scales;.
In every hedge I find not thornes:
Nor every beast doth carry homes :
1 say not soe,
That every woman causeth woe.
That were too broad :
Who loves not venom must shun tlie i*ad.
Who useth still the truth to tell,
May hlamfed be, though be say well;
Say crow is white, and snow is black.
Lay not the fault on woman’s back:
Thousands were good.
But few scap’d drowning in Noe’s fiaadt
Most are well bent,
I must say so, lest I be spent.

A SONG.
When thy beauty appears
In its graces and airs,
All bright as an angel new dropt from the s)rye{
At distance I gaze, and am awed by my leant
So strangely you dazzle my eye!
But when, without art,
Your kind thought you impart,
When your love runs in blushes through every veto ;
When it darts from your eyes, when it {nuts in you*
heart,
Then I know you’re a woman again.
“ There’s a passion and pride
In our sex,” she replied,
And thus (might I gratify both) I would dot
Still an angel appear to each lover beside,
But still be a woman to you.”

himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of

But few of noted specialists have sprung- into pre-emi-
nerice and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed in an
acute or chronic case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best friend
and benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair both
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or the proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly' too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently accompanied by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of .middle-aged
men, as well of young men, his success has been almost
invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of an.y institution in Australia—female complaints,
liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder, kidney and heart
disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele and kidney troubles.
VARICOCELE.

study of
Private, Nervous and Skin Diseases.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood,‘spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,

Perhaps vou are one who only thinks of the
UTILITIES, one who eschews everything but
what is strictly necessary. You’ve a penchant
for FLANNELS, but have a DERRY on SILKS,
and when there’s HOMESPUN about you can’t
see the occasion for bothering about PLUSH and
VELVET. Simple and good is your motto ;
you're almost a Quaker, though not quite, and
you’d rather see your money in the bank than on
your back, and dividends are hotter, say you, than
Ribbons and Laces. Well, have your own way.
We provide for all sorts and sizes.
Or perhaps you are of another class. A world-
ling, if you will, floating down the stream of life,
with “youth at the prow and pleasure at the
helm,” you want to dress well and to look well.
The eyes of the fair are upon you, and you would
win their smiles. You want Clothes and Hats
and Boots, Gloves you must have, and a thousand
other things you crave for. Rings, Lockets,
Gems, exquisite Neckties, Shirts galore, good
CIGARS, and TOBACCO of the best. You’d
like them all, wouldn’t you ? You can have them,
sir, at our store for what is, when compared to
what other stores are asking, a mere song.

GOOD-BYE, LYNETTE!
I have worked for you—toil made sweet, love,
And never I grudged an hour;
Now the dead leaves drift at our feet, love,
That trod by the trees in flower.
The scent of the rose blows over—
Head roses of all regret;
And you were my only lover,
So give me your hand, Lynette 1
O, Love-star loyally leading,
You fade in the gathering gray 1
O, Hope that has long lain bleeding,
I bury you deep to-day !
If Time has left never a token
The easier, love, to forget ;
So over the old spells broken
Give me your hand, Lynette !
I have sounded the deeps of sorrow,
I have drunk to the dregs of tears,
I shall suffer no more to-morrow,
No more than in dead past years ;
And what is our life but greeting
And parting and long regret ?
So here’s to our first mad meeting !
And here’s to our last, Lynette 1
GLENROWAN.
THE QUARRYMAN.
When the fuse is lit and the blast goes off,
The whole bill shakes with the shook ;
For there’s thirty feet of a quarry face,
And most of it solid rock.
The quarryman’s heart beats fast and high
With the clash of hammer and drill,
For he feels as the giants felt of old,
Who warred with the ribs of the hill.
The hammer of Thor that split the rocks
And cleft the hills apart,
He wouldn’t take for his tried old “ spawl,”
The delight of the quarryman’s heart.
Old as the world his kingdom is
And wide as the widest hill;
As a king he rules with an iron rod,
His sceptre a jumper or drill.
What Nature made in a million years
By the light of sun and star,
He overturns in a single day
With hammer and gad and bar ;
He knows the seams where the stone will split
To the sturdy stroke and strong —
Where the waters waved o’er the hard’ning mass
For myriad ages long.
He tells of tons by a shot brought down—
A “ knack ” that it’s hard to acquire !
Of “ narrow squeaks” when the fuse was damp
And the treacherous blast hung fire.
With hairy arms like the old moss’d rocks,
And hands that are hard as stone,
The quarryman boasts of his deeds, and thinks
No trade is as good as his own.
N.S.W.
ULOOLA.
A SCENT OF HAY.
The sun beats down upon the plains,
The grasses smell like hay,
And absent hands let slip the reins—
The rider is away
A thousand miles, a score of years ;
The crickets at his feet
Sound, in their whirring, to his ears
A reaper in the wheat.
He sees the nodding horses come,
The reaper’s circling arms ;
More distantly he hears the hum
From off the neighb’ring farms.
And hark ! his sister’s calling shrill
To Jessie on the farther hill.
Ah ! Jessie, dearest, ours was ne’er
The love that laughter grieves ;
I see you romp with flying hair
Among the drying sheaves.
I watch the flashing petticoat
Follow your movements fleet,
And swear ’tis like the foam about
Queen Aphrodite’s feet;
And, though I kissed you long ago
In the dim vanished years,
I hear your laugh, and feel your blow
Still'tingling in my ears.
A scent of hay—and then at will
I hold you close, I kiss you still.
Q.
R.A.F.
BODY AND SOUL.
When God had made your form
Of heavenly, matchless grace,
With tender touch and warm
He framed your glorious face.
He lit your eyes with his softest light,
He sprayed your hair with his sunbeams bright,
And made your beauty whole—
But Hell kept festival the night
When Satan made your soul.

SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1897-
The Result.
In three provinces—New South Wales, Vic-
toria, and Tasmania —the Federal election is
definitely settled. Definite returns from
South Australia and Westralia, where the poll
was later than in the eastern provinces, are
not available at time of writing, but the three
results already to hand are sufficiently inter-
esting. The Federal election was the first
occasion when the whole population of each
province voted as one constituency, there-
fore in some respects it probably presents a
much better reflex of popular opinion than a
poll conducted on ordinary principles could
do. In Victoria the contest was on a
straight-cut issue of Federation on Liberal
or Conservative lines ; there was practically
no sectarian or anti-Federal issue at all. In
New South Wales it was a confused, many-
sided contest between the anti-Federa-
tionists, the Catholic Federationists, Orange
Federationists, and Protestant but not
avowedly Orange Federationists, these latter
three groups being subdivided into Labor-
men, and Protectionists and Freetraders
with the fiscal issue partly hung up for the
time being, and sub-divided again into the
entire Federationists, of whom Carruthers,
Wise, and Ashton were fair specimens, and
the Federationists, like Reid and Lyne, who
were provincial so far as concerned the rail-
ways and some other questions, and only
moderately enthusiastic on other points. In
Tasmania about five candidates were enthu-
siastic Federationists, and the rest were
mostly old, well-advertised politicians who
travelled on their names and gave little
information as to the kind of Commonwealth
they proposed to construct. The poll was
largest in New South Wales, where the in-
trusion of the good old sectarian shindy
roused the public to sudden enthusiasm.
It was only a very little smaller in Victoria,
where it turned on a political issue only,
and where even that was a foregone con-
clusion ; and proportionately it was almost
microscopic in Tasmania, where there wasn’t
even a clear-cut political issue to fight about,
and where the Opposition and the Ministry
are so much alike that one might as well he
the other without anyone observing the
difference.
There were many tickets in the field. In
New South Wales the Protestant ticket con-
tained nine out of the ten winners, hut as it
was avowedly made up, not by selecting the
ten best men, but by picking the ten who
were most likely to win in any case, the
achievement didn’t amount to much. The
parsons who gathered together, and foamed,
and prayed that the Deity would be pleased
to cover their fellow-Christian, Patrick
Francis Moran, with defeat and humilia-
tion, T>y their own showing didn’t try to
choose either the most upright, or the most
intelligent, or the most patriotic, or even
the most Protestant candidates ; their one
desire was to throw in their weight with the
people who had the best chance, and by
giving them a few extra votes to make their
return additionally sure. Under these cir-
cumstances it is difficult to decide whether
the nine successful nominees won partly by
reason of the Protestant support, or whether
their majority was decreased by it, and
whether the tenth man, who didn’t win, was
blighted by the Protestants and lost his
chance through their clumsy interference. The
Orange ticket, which was almost the same as
the Protestant ticket, contained eight
winners. The National Ass, or Patriotic
League, or Prudent Federationist, or Mangy
Dog ticket didn’t contain the name of a
single winner, or the name of one individual
who came within miles of winning. The
Labor ticket was equally unfortunate. The
Bulletin ticket nominated five winners. In
Victoria, the ten candidates put forward by
the Age were all returned—a striking evi-
dence of the fact that David Syme’s paper
is not only the power behind the throne in
Victorian politics, but is, to all intents and
purposes, the throne itself. Six of the can-
didates recommended by The Bulletin were
returned. The Champion issued a ticket,
which included seven winners ; and the
Argus implored the public to vote for ten
nominees, and its disastrous support blasted
seven of them right off.
* * * *
In' New South Wales, Cardinal Moran’s
defeat was the principal surprise of the con-
test, The weakness of the support accorded
him makes the scare of the frantic Pro-
testant parsons, who wagged their monkey
beards in conclave about the danger of
Roman aggression, look supremely ridiculous.
The excitement of these twopenny bigots
probably roused up some additional Pro-
testants to vote against Mr. Moran ; but it
is equally probable that it also aroused
many additional Catholics and a good
many Protestants and a whole lot of dis-
gusted unbelievers to vote for him, and
that their interference rather helped
than hindered his candidature. Apparently,
however, Patrick Francis Moran was a
lost quantity in any case. If he had even
got an absolutely solid Catholic vote, with
no support whatever outside his own church,
he should have got ninth or tenth place ; but
apparently he didn’t get the solid Catholic
vote, or anything at all resembling it. Evi-
dently Cardinal Moran’s candidature was a
huge mistake. As the local head of the
most venerable church in Christendom he
was a shadowy power which no one could
really estimate, but which looked vast and
incredible. He voluntarily came down from
his pedestal to jostle with Foran and John
Haynes and O’Sullivan and Varney
Parkes, and he put his importance into
figures, and, as the result, he proved himself
something smaller than Copeland, and just
a fraction bigger than M‘Gowen and Criuk.
Therefore, the mystery is gone, and the
shadowy greatness is exploded, for the fact
that the visible local embodiment of the
Roman church is just a shade bigger than
M‘Go wen and Crick and only about twice
the size of Ferguson brings things down to
hard fact, and very cheap, commonplace,
hard fact at that.
* * * *
The utter failure of the National Ass or
Anti - Federation party, three of whose
party were absolutely at the end of the
long procession, while the others were very
adjacent to the same place, proves that New
South Wales, at all events, wants Federa-
tion. It may not be very sure what kind of
Federation it wants, but the fact that it
does want it is beyond question. Con-
sidering the huge masses of unreliable
literature with which the Prudent crowd
swamped the province, and the money
and energy and eloquence which it ex-
pended, the completeness of its down-
fall is remarkable. There is nothing in the
composition of the successful ten to show
exactly what species of Federation New
South Wales is in favor of. It apparently
selected, in most cases, the Federationists
who were best known, best advertised and
most personally popular, and it also, to all
appearance, went to some extent on the lines
of party politics. The list includes four
leading Protectionist politicians, four Free-
trade ditto, and two men not in politics. It
includes four absolutely solid Federationists ;
four who advocate partial Federation ; and
two who have given very little explanation
as to their views, beyond the bare statement
that they are Federationists of some kind.
But while Carruthers and Wise are among
the winners, the Labor ten, who advocated
very much the same principles, are all
defeated—some of them very badly defeated
indeed. Whether this means that the Labor-
vote is weakening, and that the party in
general isn’t what it was, or whether l
means something else, or whether it means
nothing at all, it is difficult to say.
» * * *
All the evidence tends to show that the
bulk of the electors never troubled to accu-
rately investigate the Fedei'al principles of
the candidates, and troubled very little or
knew very little about their views in detail,
or if it did know them it preferred to be
guided by other considerations. Thus 85,000
votes were cast for Carruthers, while Ash-
ton, on almost exactly the same opinions,
scored about 20,000. Again, H eydon, of
the Prudent Federation crowd, obtained
16,000 votes, while his colleague, Nugent
Robertson, who upheld the same banner,
and who should have got the same votes if
they were given to Heydon for his opinions
only, comes ignominiously at the end with
2000. Of the ten successful candidates eight
are the best-advertised politicians in the pro-
vince—the eight whose names are oftenest in
print and are most familiar to everybody who
reads the daily papers. Apparently the
public decided —first, that it wanted ho sec-
tarian disturbance in the matter; second,
that it wanted Federation; third, that it
didn’t want the Labor element, but desired,
in the main, to stick to the two old, solid,
stock crowds that it had heard most about —
their chronic fiscal shindy having kept them
well to the front. Then it voted principally
for the old familiar hacks of the old familiar
parties, with no regard at all for finer shades
of opinion. That is the moral of the New
South Wales Federal election, so far as the
results show any moral at all.
* * * *
The Victorian result throws very little
light on the Federal sentiment of the pro-
vince in most respects, though, on one at
least, it makes it sufficiently clear. But it
throws a great illumination on local politics.
The candidates were divided mostly into the
Conservative or Upper House party, and the
Liberal party as represented by the Assem
bly. The men who came out on top include
eight Liberals and two Conservatives, and
these two are Conservatives of a very mild
type ; also, even they got in with difficulty,
and probably for no other reason than that
they were on the ticket of the all-powerful
Age. Victoria, unlike New South Wales,
has one Labor-man, Teen with, among the
successful ten. The results show—first, that
Premier Turner is the most popular and the
most trusted among the public men of Vic-
toria ; he comes first on the list by a big
majority, whereas in New South Wales Pre-
mier Reid is only a moderate second. Also,
the fact that Turner’s two colleagues, Pea-
cock and Isaacs, are high up amongst
the chosen representatives, shows that
the Ministry in general has the strong
support of the people. The dismal
failure of every Legislative Council can-
didate, except the two who were sup-
ported by the Ministerial newspaper, de-
molishes in one act the impudent pretence
that the House of 48 Rich Landlords really
represents the popular sentiment, and proves
that the Victorian people want a Federal
Parliament as unlike the House of Landlords,
and as unlike the one which the 48 Rich
Landlords would naturally construct, as is
possible. As a commentary on the alleged
Freetrade revival, not one Freetrade candi-
date came within gunshot of success; and
the fact that not one Oppositionist, not even
M ‘lntyre and Gillies, the leaders and shin-
ing lights of the party, was at the front, makes
the chances of the old boom party for next
election look too small to be worth discus-
sion. The exact details of the Federation
which the Victorians want are about as hard
to arrive at, judging from the ten selected
delegates, as the exact views of the New
South Wales people on the same subject.
But the exact views of Victoria about the
Argus and the Upper House and the Tory
Opposition, and about its newly-returned
Gillies, and Murray Smith, the leader of
the Foreign-trade forlorn hope, and about
the large, dull, hesitating MTntvre, who
fondly imagines the country is waiting
anxiously for a chance to make him Premier
—all these are quite evident.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Few Casual Difficulties.
If the Federal Convention adopts the scheme,
advocated by Carruthers and others, whereby
the railways are to be taken over at a valuation
based on net earnings, instead of all the debts,
railways, telegraphs, post-offices, fortifications!
lighthouses, &c., being taken over in a lump
without inquiry, it will start a fine series of
complications. The following are a few of
them. The telegraphs must, like the railways
be taken over at a valuation based on net earn-
ings. The post-offices must be treated on the
same basis ; none of the other provinces, except
W estialia, can make so good a showing on the
railways as N.S.W., but most of them show
better on the posts and telegraphs, and if the
valuation system is to be applied where N S W
and Westralia will gain by it, then the other
three will inevitably demand that it shall come
in likewise where they will realise a profit. The
fortifications, barracks, guns, lighthouses, &c.
will have to be valued by experts and taken
over at their present worth also. The railway
valuation, too, isn’t so simple as it looks. It is
not merely a question of taking over the lines
according to the net earnings as shown bv each
province, for each province has a method"of its
own by which it arrives at the earnings, and
they must be ca culated all over again on a
uniform scale before anything can be arrived
at. in Victoria, pensions to superannuated em-
ployes are reckoned as part of the expenses ; in
N.S.W. they are not. Some provinces, esp e .
eially N.S.W., swell the apparent earnings bv
making large payments to the railway depart-
ment as the value of free-passea to politicians
distinguished visitors, unemployed, &c. • Vj c !
toria swells its revenue by paying the railways a
subsidy on condition that they carry local coal
at reduced rates. Some provinces pay the
railways a needlessly large amount for carrying
postal matter ; others do not. As the matter
merely consists of a cross-entry in a book, the
railways can be credited with any amount un
to twenty millions a year or more under this
heading ; it costs nothing save the ink used in
making the entry, and it merely depends on
whether the local idea is to make the railways
look profitable while the post-office isn’t or
whether the yearning is to make the post-office
look profitable while the railways are not. In
Victoria the lines are almost all fenced in-
they are mostly fenced in N.S.W., and mostly
unfenced in S.A. Fencing doesn’t pay any
cash return, but it is an expense which must be
faced as population increases, and the liability
which is handed over to the Commonwealth
under this head counts for something. The
next trouble is that no two provinces have the
same policy as regards the expenses which
are paid out of revenue and called main-
tenance, and those which are paid out of
borrowed money and called construction
and this matter has to be carefully adjusted
before a valuation can be arrived at. Also
the amount and condition of the rolling-
stock must be considered ; old, worn - out
vehicles may earn as much just now as new
ones, hut there is a great difference between
having to replace them next year or ten years
hence. When the estimate is made and the
amount of debt to be taken over is decided,
the question which next arises is—which part
of the debt is to be taken over by the Common-
wealth ? Is it to be the 4 and 5 and 6 per cent,
portion of it, or mainly the 3£ per cent, part?
Are the provinces to keep the part bearing the
smallest interest, or the highest, or some of
both ? Supposing the 3J and 4 per cent, debt
is about enough to take over in payment for the
assets surrendered by the States, does N.S.W.
get any special concession as compared with
Victoria, because it has less debt at 4 per cent,
and more at 3£ ? Also, do Victoria and N.S.W.
get any special concessions from S.A. because
the latter has a larger proportion of 4 percent,
debt and a smaller proportion of 3jj per cent,
ditto than either? Again, does Victoria get
any concession as against N.S.W. because the
4 per cent, debt which it will hand over runs
out at an earlier date, and can be sooner coif-
verted into 3 per cents., and a big saving thus
effected ? The idea of handing over the pro-
vincial assets and liabilities on a strict valuation
basis, instead of taking them as they come
without question, looks very beautiful, but it
will bleach the hair of the financier who attempts
to figure things out.
♦
Orthodoxy and “Blanky.”
The panning - out of the Federal election
strongly supports The Bulletin’s contention
that the sectarian spectre isn’t feeling well in
N.S.W. these times. On Thursday night half
Sydney turned out to watch the results as they
arrived, and where the figures were* exhibited
the streets were practically impassable, and
the air was filled with a sound like 2000 people
saying “ blanky ” all at the same instant. And
in all the great city not one chunk of road-
metal, so far as is known, was thrown in the
sectarian cause ; nobody was stoushed for the
love of God ; nobody obtrusively damned the
Pope ; nobody cheered once for the Orange ten ;
nobody vociferated for the Cardinal worth a
cent.; and Derry and William 111. and the
Protestant conference and St. Patrick were as
dead to that great, good-humored mob as if
they had never been alive. The 800,000 Aus-
tralian natives in N.S.W. are ten years older
than they were in the last days of the Kiama
ghost, and are making themselves felt in poli-
tics, and the white native is almost as stolidly
indifferent as the black aboriginal to parsonical
influences. The infuriated clergy of Sydney
wildly spanked the dead horse of orthodoxy in
the ears of this multitude to no visible purpose.
They explained to their hearers that the
universe is infinite, that the worlds in-
cluded in it are infinite and beyond
number, and that all the numerals in
creation, though they commenced with a
nine and filled fifty thousand huge volumes
with noughts, would not even begin to explain
how many they were. Then they explained
that our globe is one small unit among them all
—a thing akin to an odd speck of dust lying
about promiscuously nowhere in particular, and
that Australia is an odd fraction of this speck,
and N.S.W. a mere fraction of Australia; and
they invited the people to believe that the
Almighty architect of the whole affair was
personally watching them and their little creeds
hustle each other on the side of this speck to
keep down an individual whose views about the
Architect and the speck were somewhat dif-
ferent from their own. And the 800,000 irre-
verent natives said something that sounded
like “ blanky ” and took practically no further
notice. The great Australian adjective is, to a
large extent, the symbol of the great and grow-
ing Australian contempt for sectarianism and
sectarian squabbles. If the churches can put
down “ blanky,” then sectarianism may take
permanent root in Australia ; the present signs
are that “ blanky ” will probably put down the
churches instead. The Bulletin doesn’t pre-
tend that “ blanky ” is preferable to bigotry —
on the whole, it is inclined to think it would
rather have bigotry than “ blanky it merely
notes the fact that “ blanky ” is uppermost at
present, and seems likely to continue so.

State Rights and National Wrongs.
The party which wants to make the Federal
Parliament mostly a shadow, and to reserve the
bulk of the power in the hands of the State
Legislatures, has one argument that is dished up
until it becomes a weariness. The United
States, it is said, is run on this principle;
therefore the principle must be correct. The
average auditor hasn’t the shadow of an idea
how the U.S. gets on under the State Rights
system, but when it is quoted as a glorious


example lie assumes that it is right else it
wouldn’t be quoted. He is told to “ Look at
the United States,” and he looks vaguely in an
eastward direction towards Watson’s Bay and
feels a good deal convinced. The U.S. is the
country where each State makes its own mar-
riage and divorce laws, so that the woman who
is a wife in one town may be only an un-
married mother in the next one across the State
border, and the lawful infant in this village
may be a bastard in the one adjacent. It is a
country, too, of many weird political complica-
tions. Not very long ago, a Louisiana mob
murdered some Italian citizens, and the State
courts refused to do justice on the murderers ;
also the State Legislature declined to pay com-
pensation to their widows and orphans. Where-
upon it was discovered, in the course of the
row with Italy which naturally ensued, that
the miserably impotent Federal Government
couldn’t compel the arrest of the criminals ; it
couldn’t compel compensation to be paid ; it
couldn’t interfere, unless requested to do so by
the State authorities, to prevent more butchery ;
in fact, it could do nothing to prevent any little
wild-cat State of the Union running it into a
war with a big European Power if the State
felt so inclined, and when the war came it
would have to do the fighting all the same.
The Federal Government, in this case, got out
of the difficulty by privately grovelling
to Italy and paying compensation without
the authority of Congress, from the secret
service fund—in other words, it crawled out of
a very awkward situation by misappropriating
the public money. The U.S. Government had
even to break the law very badly before it
could interfere to suppress the Chicago riots ;
according to the strict letter of the beautiful
State Rights principle it should have stood by
idly while the second city of the Union was
wrecked and possibly laid in ashes. It also
broke the law badly when it suppressed slavery;
in fact, it is so impotent that it can do very
little in the way of keeping order without
breaking the law. That republic is a solid
proof that our Federal Government should be
made as strong as possible ; on the State Rights
question it isn’t so much an example to be fol-
lowed as a horrible warning as to where this
country may get to if it goes in for being a ser-
vile copyist of things it doesn’t rightly under-
stand.
The Prisoner of ’Frisco.
In spite of x-rays, treaties of arbitration, the
cinematograpiie, the poems of J. C. Neild,
and such matters —human nature doesn’t seem
to go ahead much, after all. It isn’t easy, at
all events, to get swelled-head about the “ pro-
gress of the species ” in view of the fact that
the prisoner of ’Frisco is having greatness thrust
upon him by the women who are “ sending him
every day piles of flowers and quantities of
dainty victuals, and inquiring anxiously what
more they can do for his comfort.” And this,
be it remembered, wholly and solely upon the
strength of their belief in his double-dyed crimi-
nality. As an ordinary, single-barrelled mur-
derer, or as a man reasonably suspected of being
innocent, it’s pretty certain that Mr. Ashe-
Harwood-Bctler w'ould have had to content
himself with the delicate attentions of his
gaolers, but by the delightful possibility that
he is the cold-blooded and treacherous assassin
of an indefinite number of confiding persons
he is at once invested with a putrid kind
of interest, and placed upon a pedes-
tal for the diseased hero - worship of
the neurotic and sensation-chasing woman who
appears to have reached her highest develop-
ment in the States. Sentimental and super-
sympathetic though a woman of this stamp
may appear upon the surface, there are grounds
for believing that this craving to be associated
by hook or crook with some notorious criminal
has its root in a criminal tendency latent in the
woman herself. Hysteria and homicide are
mysteriously, but unmistakeably related, and
hysterico-sentimentalism is a marked charac-
teristic of the congenital and instinctive
criminal. The people, also, who whoop most
valiantly for “battle, murder, and sudden
death,” are mostly mighty careful of their own
skins, because theirs is that sub-hysterical tem-
perament which loves personal notoriety as
much as it dreads personal danger. As long,
therefore, as we have still with us the war-
preaching parson, the murderer-worshipping
woman, and the caterwauling cut-throat, we
had better cease to blow a fantasia in our own
honor upon the Trumpet of the Nineteenth
Century.
Straight-Out!
Dear Bulletin,— The Turko-Grecian amenities
in Crete have brought down upon us a cataract
of the weary old slush about the “ brutal and
bloodthirsty Turk ” and the “ poor, persecuted
Eastern Christian ” —patient, virtuous, and in-
offensive, according to the prating pulpiteers
who have had no personal experience either of
him or of his supposed- oppressor. Now, I
know well both Turk and Levantine, and I
deliberately assert that the average Eastern
Christian isn’t fit to be mentioned in the same
day with the average Moslem. Hassan is
mostly a stolid, goodmatured kind of animal
kind to his family, charitable to the unfortunate,
not often a liar, and very rarely a rogue ;
whereas Spirito— besides being pretty gener-
ally both liar and rogue—is almost invari-
ably a sneak, heartily despised as such by a
people who—at all events in the middle and
lower classes —are just about as manly as
they make ’em,” and who are, paradoxi-
cally, much more in accord with the Chris-
tian ideal than most of those who profess to
be striving thereafter. For which latter reason
—speaking, myself, as an entirely and hopelessly
creed less person —I say, straight-out, that the
religion of Mahomet produces better practical
results locally than the Christian religion
that the Turk, under ordinary conditions, is a
better man in every relation of life than the
“Christian” within his gates —and that, when
it comes to reciprocal throat-cutting, he is not
one whit more ferocious than the Christian
aforesaid. In these slaughterings at Crete and
elsewhere it has been six of one and half-a-
dozen of the other. Hatred begets hatred, and
the Turk is no more to blame than the Greek or
the Armenian for a racial antagonism which he
inherits ready-made and piping-hot. Also,
when an eminent evangelic went a-maundering,
the other day, about the “ accursed religion of
the sword,” and the “brutal murdering of
thousands for no other offence than that of
being Christians,” he didn’t remember —or
made it convenient to forget—that the Thirty
Years’ War alone, out of countless wholesale
Christian buteherings, cost a vastly greater
number of lives than the whole Mahometan
propaganda, and that the most devilish tor-
ments ever devised by mind of man were
invented by Christians— for Christians 1 It is
Christianity—after 19 centuries of mouthing
about “peace and goodwill towards men”—
that is to-day essentially the “ religion of the
sword ” —of the repeating-rifle, the machine-
gun, and the torpedo. The “ Christian nations”
have become little better than vast camps of
elaborately-trained killers of their kind, and
the brain of the Christian inventor is every day
devising yet more and more ingenious con-
trivances for the wholesale immolation of his
fellow-Christians. And all the while, from
pulpit, and altar, and platform are droned-
out the same old mendacities about the
blessings of the Bible, and the growth of
brotherly love, and the regeneration of man-
kind by a creed which has stubbornly obstructed
every single step forward in the real enlighten-
ment of humanity. Also, when, one of these
days, the bayonet-bristling situation shall
become no longer endurable, and two nations
spring at each other’s throats, the same old
snuffle will be wafted upwards from the sham-
bles, and the winning side will blasphemously
bless the Lord for having helped it to be the
more successful murderer ! Does God ever
laugh ? —Heretic.

The coming Australian Convention will start,
so far as certain of the provinces are concerned,
with almost the whole of the political stock-in-
trade in hand which the first Chartist Conven-
tion, 60 years ago, vainly hoped to achieve for
England. Humanity progresses, at all events,
in sections. The first Chartist Convention met
in the Dr. Johnson Hotel, in London, in 1839,
and drew up a charter of demands which
scared Liberals and roused Tories to shout for
the police. Yet the six points of that charter
were as follow :
1. Universal Suffrage.
2. Vote by Ballot.
3. Annual Parliaments.
4. Abolition of Property Qualification.
5. Equal Electoral Districts.
6. Payment of Members.
With the exception of annual Parliaments, most
divisions of Australia now possess all the points
of that charter. This of itself should give the
Convention a base broad enough to enable it to
make the Federation the freest and, humanly,
the most powerful of political organisations.
What could men like the Chartists do, hemmed
in as they were by the prejudices of ages and
denied the use of the political instruments
Australian Conventionists now possess ? Vote
by ballot was called revolution, manhood suff-
rage execrated as a mad folly, abolition of'pro-
perty qualifications denounced as the dream of
sansculottes, and payment of members stigma-
tised as robbery of the exchequer.
A fine example of the average intelligence of
The Bulletin’s countrymen :
Most sapient Bulletin,— How well you gauged the
popular sentiment in all three of the provinces where the
Federal elections have been held. In Victoria four of
your nominees have been incontinently chucked out,
while a fifth is likely to follow in their wake, as it is ex-
tremely probable that when the complete returns come
in it will be found that Henry Wrixon has surmounted
the little difference between himself and Higgins. Of my
nominees only three have been rejected, namely, Pi'RVKS,
M‘lntyre and Murray Smith. Turner is a proud man
this morning, while t £ Smith doesn’t feel very well. I
said the doctor would be at the bottom of the poll, and,
you see, I was right.
In N.S.W. no less than six of your nominees have been
relegated to obscurity, while one of them, Millen, has
actually scooped the booby prize and lost his deposit.
In Tasmania five of your nominees have been rejected.
It remains to be seen how you will get on in South Aus-
tralia, but it is rather a come down to have 15, and
possibly 16. out of 30 nominees chucked out. Dear 8.,
please to take a back seat for the future.—Yours, &c.,
Trotter Bethune, Moonee Ponds, Vic., Mar. 5, 1897.
Truly the world is full of people who can’t read
ordinary large print. The Bulletin explained
all it knew that it wasn’t giving a list of the men
who, it believed, would get in, but of those who,
in its opinion, ought to get in. It was perfectly
aware that its list had no great chance, because
it selected its men on their merits, whereas the
ordinary Trotter Bethune kind of person
always votes for the best-advertised old hack
politicians; it didn’t aim at tipping winners,
and it said so over and over again. But the
Australian is apparently so accustomed to
horse-race tips that he can’t understand the
distinction. The Bulletin announced the 40
men whom it wanted to see returned according
to its own political conscience, and Trotter
Bethune and his kind can’t get rid of an idea
that this paper had gone out with a bag and a
hooked nose and was betting on t hese ten.
Verily the great horse-disease breaks out in
strange places.

In Victoria they propose to hang very par-
ticularly the survivor of the attempted double
suicide at Middle Park, but in the same pro-
vince, when an assassin was convicted the other
day of systematically scattering incurable
disease by selling milk from a tuberculosed
cow, the penalty was <£lo fine. The horrible
animal and its owner resided in a suburb. It
was a particularly bad cow —in fact, its disease
had almost degenerated into living decomposi-
tion, and its state was visible even to the most
unprofessional eye, and it was set down as
almost the record diseased cow of the province.
The owner, in addition to selling the milk as
long as the cow would hold together, finished up
by trying to sell the animal itself—presumably
for food. The law provides a maximum penalty
of <£loo or two years’ imprisonment, which is
sufficiently cheap for wholesale murder done
for the sake of the price of a few quarts of
milk—in fact, considering the view the law
takes of Butler, it seems amazingly cheap. As
the local Doo berries, however, fixed the
price of about the worst case going at only £lO
it appears that even the moderate penalty
provided by law is mainly a matter of form.
The dirty J.P. and the insanitary magistrate
make reform practically impossible in such
cases ; all over Australia the average price of
wilful murder by diseased milk and diseased
meat is hardly more than £5 at the out-
side. And, under these circumstances, the
absurdity of the fuss that is made about a
comparatively insignificant alleged criminal
like Butler is apparent. Obviously Butler,
on the same basis, should, if convicted, be fined
£2, and ordered to pay the money within a
week.

Dear Bulletin,—Here is a Sydney daily
paper paragraph :
At Newtown Court yesterday, Aug. Conrade was
charged, at the instance of Matilda Coot (agent for
James Ellison), with having on 19th inst., removed a
quantity of furniture from a house in Park-avenue, Ash-
iield, to avoid distraint for rent. Defendant said he was
out of work, and sold r.he furniture to get food. Mr.
Johnson, S.M., inflicted a line of £5 (being double the
estimated value of the furniture), levy and distress, with
the alternative of six months’ hard labor. Conradk was
allowed a month in which to pay the fine.
This is a case where only the poor man goes
to gaol. It is under an old Act of Geo. 11.,
which provides in effect that where a tenant
fraudulently conveys away his goods to evade
distraint, the landlord can recover double their
value by action in the Supreme Court. But if
the value of the goods doesn’t exceed <£so, then
he may proceed in the police-court, and it is
only in these proceedings that the tenant is
liable to imprisonment in default of payment.
The magistrate has no option to give less than
six months with hard labor unless the money be
sooner paid. So, if you remove £6O worth,
you can only be sued in the Supreme Court
for £l2O, and if you haven’t the money,
the landlord can whistle for his debt and costs.
There is an easy way of evading the statute —
but poor devils who want to sell their furniture
to get food don’t know of it. The Act refers to
the fraudulent removal of the tenant’s goods.
There’s nothing to prevent his removing any-
one else’s. So if he sells the goods first, then
he can take them away safely. Of course, the
landlord can still distrain on them, and stop
their going, if he gets there in time. But that’s
another matter. He can’t send the tenant to
gaol, for then the goods are not his —they are
the buyer’s. So if he gives a bill-of-sale—they
then belong in law to the bill-of-sale holder.
This isn’t speculation ; it’s established law*. So
well-established that, though the same Act
gives the landlord the right to follow the goods
removed and distrain on them wherever they
are, the careful lawyer always advises him not
to risk it. There are too many pitfalls. But
it’s a safe game going for a poor beggar who
has only a few sticks, and cheap even if you
lose. By the way, the anomaly has a curious
origin. When the Act was passed, if you got
a judgment against a man in the Supreme
Court, you could ca. sa. him, and keep him in
gaol till he rotted —or paid. So the provision
about six months’ imprisonment was a merciful
one, in favor of the poor man. Now that the
ca. sa. for debt has been to a large extent
abolished, it cuts the other way.— Shark.
“Operator” on the telegraph code question: —
Dear Bulletin,—The howl from “Lightning Squirter”
in your issue of 20th Feb. was caused by sheer funk. I
ought to know, as I felt it badly myself some years ago,
when, after being suckled for eight years on the “per-
fect” Australian code, I joined the Cable Co., and found
I had to learn the miserable Universal. The dear old
sounds “engraved on my brain,” however, wore out in
one week, and the next I took charge of the circuit. The
land circuit in the same office used the Australian alpha-
bet, and for seven years, all day long, I heard the two
codes rattling away, cheek by jowl. Strange to say,
“ malgr6 moi,” I grew to detest the jerky jingle of the
old love. Strange also to say, there was never any con-
fusion, nor were mistakes made, although a man would
work Australian one day and Universal the next. Yet
“Lightning Squirter” foresees terrible havoc played in
Australian business when the change is absolutely made.
He doesn’t give outsiders a high opinion of the ability of
his fellow-operators. The Universal code is faster.
Its alphabet of the 26 letters contains 82 dots and
dashes, while the Australian contains 86-. TO say, there-
fore, that the latter is faster is to utter “tommy
rot.” What is “Lightning Squirter” giving us about
the American code? The Yankees use a fearful and
wonderful system of dots that would puzzle the Austra-
lian operator worse than shorthand. The Universal
alphabet contains signals to meet the requirements of
every language and the whole range of accented letters.
The question is, why should Australia put up with a
mongrel code neither Universal nor American, when the
code proposed is scientifically arranged and actually
faster ? I would like to assure the general body of opera-
tors that there is really no cause for alarm. There are
only 13 letters different, F and R are the only two that
clash, and a little daily practice will prove that the new
code is astonishingly easy to master.— Operator.
“ Crimson Thread ” on the same subject:—
Editor Bulletin. —Let me briefly answer the two main
points of “ Silken Bond’s ” letter, viz., the alleged “ sim-
plicity ” of the American code and his speed figures, the
result of “ recent exhaustive tests.” The American code
contains certain symbols called spaced letters. For in-
stance, c is composed of a combination of the signs repre-
senting i and e ; two e’s form the letter o ; several more are
built on the same plan, whilst l is signalled by a “ pro-
longed dash,” which also stands for the cypher 0!
“ Unless very carefully formed,” says Gulley, in his
“ Practical Telegraphy ” (page 249), “ these letters are
liable to be mistaken for others.” The “spaced letter”
and the “ prolonged dash ” with a dual significance
should find no place in any scientifically - con-
structed alphabet, and the American man in this respect
showed a poverty of resource quite foreign to his
nation. There are no complexities of this kind in the
International code. It was designed on the principle
which should govern all codes and cyphers ; one char-
acter, one signification. Wheatstone’s automatic, in its
present form, is not possible in Australia so long as the
“ prolonged dash ” monstrosity exists. As regards speed,
“A. 5.8.” is sadly in error. His “38 words per minute
for an hour or longer ” is good work, but it is not sensa-
tional, while his modest allowance of 31 words per
minute for the International is sheer nonsense. Some
authenticated Maoriland records herewith. During one
of our cable breaks, a financial statement was cabled
from Wanganui to Wakapuaka—the only alternative
route. Time taken, two hours ; rate of working, 43)4
words per minute. The same operator has frequently ex-
ceeded 40, and Maoriland rejoices in many men of his
calibre. The frequent cable breaks brought out picked
men from whom a minimum of 35 or 36 words per minute
was expected. The men responded so well that 40 words
per minute was often exceeded. Six hours a day, in two
three-hour spells, with an interim of six hours, was the
daily task of these officers. In conclusion, let me remind
“A. 5.8.” that the International is also a Morse code :
moreover, the Australian code is not the American code,
pure and unadulterated. Let him refer to his Culley and
see for himself.— Crimson Thread.
Melb. Age thinks each State of the Common-
wealth should fix its own franchise for Federal
elections because “Victoria is no more en-
titled to dictate to Queensland.and West Aus-
tralia that they shall adopt the ‘ one man one
vote ’ than that Mr. Kingston should insist
on all the Australian world accepting female
suffrage for federal purposes.” This is the
last possible absurdity in logic. Victoria has
an absolute right to help to dictate how N.S. W.
and S.A. and Tasmania shall elect their repre-
sentatives in the Federal Parliament, and they
have an absolute right to dictate how Victoria
shall elect hers, and each province has a right
to dictate all she can to all the other provinces.
In the Federal Parliament, the vote of a member
irom the Northern Territory will govern Vic-
toria just as much as the vote of one from Mel-
bourne ; and the vote of the man from Cool-
gardie will govern N.S.VV. as much as that of
the man from Sydney ; and the Sydney and
Melbourne men will boss Tasmania as much as
the men from Hobart and Launceston, and
rice versa right through the whole list. There-
fore, if eacii man hasn t as much say in fixing
the federal franchise for the other provinces as
for his own he has lost his powers of self-govern-
ment. If the theory that each province is to
tix its own Federal franchise holds good, then
each electorate should fix its own provincial
franchise ; if N.S. W. hasn’t any right to a voice
in deciding how Westralia shall elect its Federal
members, then Sydney has no right to a voice in
deciding on what basis Parramatta shall choose
its local M.L.A. The proposal to have five
different franchises in the Commonwealth is
gratuitous confusion, with no advantage about
it to make up for the confusion.
A Northern correspondent to The Bulletin :
There exists in Sydney an agency which, for 10s. 6d. a
head, will forward to any part of Queensland (or any
other place, for anything I know to the contrary) big,
strapping fellows from 16 years of age, bound down by
agreement as “ generally useful ” station-hands for three
years, at the following rate of “wages”: £l3 for the
first year, £ls for the second year, and £2O for the last
year, with “the usual board and residence.” Out of the
first quarter’s wages the boss deducts the passage-money,
which to Mackay is £3 10s., and which is refunded to the
“ reserves the right to cancel this agreement at any time,
upon giving one month’s notice to the said
should he fail to comply with the terms of this agree-
ment . . . the said ‘ emplovd ’ reserving the same right of
notice, providing the amount of passage-money advanced
to the said ‘ ’is earned.” All the words in in-
verted commas are copied verbatim from the agreement.
There are —or, more correctly speaking, there were —three
of these unfortunates in this district, two of whom have
“ jacked ”up after about six months’ work. The third is
a tall, strapping fellow of over 20 years of age, the son of
apparently well-to-do parents ; he replaced a man who
was driving a butcher’s cart for 15s. a week and tucker—
I suppose driving a meat-cart comes in underthe heading
of the duties of a generally-useful station-lad as per
agreement. The Q Government is going to spend large
sums of money in getting immigrants to come here ; why
not send the necessary commission to the person who
runs that Sydney agency, which, I am sure, will be able
to supply Queensland with all the cheap-labor needed at
half-a-guinea per head, a reduction made on large con-
signments ?—A.S.B.G.
Brisbane (Q.) Courier :
These colonies wish the world to clearly understand
that they thoroughly identify themselves with the mother
country.
Is there any such wish on the part of these
provinces? No. For instance, these provinces
wish China to clearly understand that they
don’t identify themselves with England in the
matter of admitting pigtail-yellowskins free of
poll-tax. These provinces wish Japan to clearly
understand that they don’t identify themselves
with England in the matter of the Anglo-
Japanese treaty. Pious newspapers like Bris-
bane Courier ought not to imagine or invent
Australian wishes —the average Australian is
quite capable of being a good-enough liar
on his own account. The average Australian
doesn’t yearn to identify himself with the
foreign scoopful of dirt that the pious editor
calls “ the mother country.” The average
Australian’s mother-country is Australia. The
average Australian doesn’t care a rap about
identification with England, a place he has
never seen. He’ll hooray for the Queen, if
there is beer about; hut he’d hooray for a man
who rode a bicycle over a bar-counter and
set up the drinks for the township. The
average Australian doesn’t care a curse
about anything except horse-racing, cricket
(at which he believes he can whop Eng-
land) and, just now, biking. The average
Australian’s general attitude is—“Never-
mind !” or “Who’s a-goin’ to do it?” Bull,
on the other hand, brags about his “ kawlinies ”
—his “ beastly kawlinies.” What Bull really
loves about Australia are his mortgages and
liens on it, and the dividends that he gets out
of it. The Australian Fat Man talks England,
and, in his way, loves England as much as he
can love anything—because he loves himself,
and rejoices in “ splashes ” and grovel and titles
and baubles of all sorts. The workers of Aus-
tralia owe England only the love that the pro-
digal owes to his pawnbroker. Poll the
Australias to-morrow and the workers—even
those who hooray for England and Fat Man,
cursing both in their hearts of hearts—would
sign this answer: “These provinces wish the
world to clearly understand that they do not
identify themselves with England, and that
England knows it, and lias to let them have
their own way when they want it. Some day
these provinces will get tired of being too lazy
to run their show under their own shingle.”
The Wesleyan Conference assembled at Mel-
bourne snorted fiercely at “General” Booth
because of his proposed invasion of Fiji and the
other Pacific islands, and suspects the Army
man of meditating a poaching expedition
amongst their spiritual preserves. The Rev.
Bickford pointed out that to all intents and
purposes the Wesleyan missions own Fiji.
“Ninety per cent, of the people are found
every Lord’s Day in our churches.” “We
have 3800 paid workers there,” &c., &c. Booth
will, no doubt, reason that the island which
will support 3800 professional sin-shifters will
support anything. The Army will wade in,
band and all, and Fiji will have to pay the
piper, also the drummer. Evidently the Wes-
leyan Conference believes that when a sect has
got any particular savage by the wool old Eng-
land should grant it a monopoly of that savage
to the hitter end. The Fijian, it seems, has
become very industrious under Wesleyan rule.
The Bulletin is sorry for him ; once he lived
in beautiful idleness in an Eden of his own, and
now he has to work like a fiend to keep a lot
of holy foreigners, who offer in return their
Eden, which, happily, they don’t want them-
selves.
The Age begins to speak coldly of the
doings of Vic. railway-manager Mathieson. Fact
seems to be that D. Syine will not be satisfied
until the railways are run by a private Co. Federa-
tion should put a head on any little game of that
kind, however.

A sceptical doctor recently called at the

to test the effectiveness of the X rays. He placed
his hand upon the fluorescent screen, and straight-
way saw several shot pellets which had been

humorous, provide more entertainment than all
the numerous imitators put together. Other

Henry Bracy’s new operatic venture at
Sydney Lyceum commenced well on Saturday
iight. The “Beggar Student” may not be
an absolutely first-class opera, but it is bright and
pleasant and musical, and sufficiently comic for
any reasonable purpose, and it hasn t been ground
out persistently by the fleshless hand of Time on
the barrel-organ of monotony until it has become
a weariness. The “ Student ”is one of the least-
hackneyed of bygone operas, and to most of the
Saturday audience it might as well have been new.
All the evening the proceedings weren’t once
audibly broken in upon by the strident voice of
the person who knows all about it telling his
neighbour what was going to happen next, which
is a sufficient evidence in support of the above
assertion. Henry Bracy has few equals as a stage-
manager, and it naturally follows that the mechani-
cal part of the show goes smoothly, and the mount-
ing is excellent. The co. is also, in most respects,
up to a high standard. Miss Mabelle Darley
made a big success fro ,n the first, and, as her ner
vousness wore off somewhat, her success was still
greater and the enthusiasm of the audience became
tremendous. It is a long time since an almost
unknown actress got such a reception in Sydney.
Miss Darley has a very pretty soprano voice, a
graceful figure, considerable ability as an actress, and
a face and a smile and a very special set of teeth
which made the first-night gallery fall down and
worship her then and there. Miss Julia Spencer,
also more or less unknown, trills her little part
satisfactorily. Mrs. Bracy is still the same sterling
artist, and Bracy himself as Simon the impostor,
John Forde, who plays his very old part as Colonel
Ollendorf, and Miss Nina Osborne, leave little to
be wished for. The chorus, bossed by George
Pack, has been drilled into a remarkable state of
perfection, and altogether the “ Beggar Student ”
goes as well as it ever did —also as well as it is
ever likely to go. The “Student” isn’t in itself
an absolutely overwhelming opera, but Bracy’s
co. brings out all the music, and John Forde in
particular brings out all the comedy there is in it.
Miss Darley’s smile and the aforesaid set of teeth
do the rest.
** # *
“Matsa” has, so far, crowded Her
Majesty’s all it can hold, and only the most grasp-
ing kind of management could ask for more.
Regarded as a pictorial outbreak, the view of
ancient Memphis and the Rising of the Nile could
hardly be improved upon, and, if it can be
guaranteed by any reliable authority that bygone
Khem did look at all like'that, the present writer’s
desire to start back 4000 years or so, and live in
the land where all these graceful brown legs are, is
simply overwhelming. Howard Vernon’s mummy,
which didn't get the space it deserved last week,
is in keeping with the rest of the picture ; Vernon
has, apparently, a natural capacity for being a
generous-souled moral mummy, and his old
Egyptian aspect is very touching. The variety
business which is thrown into the last act is
the weakest part of the show —barring Little
Gulliver, who is always welcome. It has no
relation to the old Egyptian gorgeousness
which went before it, or the new Egyptian
gorgeousness which is around it, and Knowles, not
being got up as a mummy, seems out of keeping,
and his only connection with the Rising of the
Nile lies in the writer’s idea that some of his
jokes must have had a narrow escape from drown-
ing in that aged catastrophe. But, all the same,
“ Matsa ” is a marvellous show, and should have
a long and prosperous future before it, for it em-
bodies the sudden arrival of more paint, and sun-
light effects, and desert, and pale moon, and
massive architecture than the eye can take in all
at once. Moreover, the brown legs that swarm in
Memphis are just the ideal legs that The Bulle-
tin habitually sees in its dreams.
** * *
About six months from now, if present
arrangements hold good, the Brough Comedy
Co. dissolves, and Mr. and Mrs. Brough give up
management in Australia and depart England-
wards. The interval is to be spent playing fare-
well seasons in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, and
the principal towns of Maoriland. Considering
the splendid record the Broughs have put up in
twelve years’ of continuous toil, everyone who has
ever seen them on the stage will regret their de-
parture. The Bulletin moves that an influential
deputation, with Dan O’Connor carefully ex-
cluded, should wait upon them, and ask them to
put a name to any inducement which will lead
them to stay, and that the inducement, if it is
anything within reach, should be put up forth-
with. Even the sacrifice of QuongTart would be
justifiable in such a case.
** * *
Westmacott’s drama, at Sydney Royal, is
getting along as well as could be expected con-
sidering that six theatres are struggling to make a
simultaneous crust in Sydney, and Howden’s
highly deserving bit of scenery in Actl. —which is
a highly deserving piece of scenery even when Hans
Phillips interferes with it by striking impossible
attitudes with a gun on a roof—has a good share
in the success. The management announces, how-
ever, that the “Shamrock and the Rose” will
ensue on Saturday.
The “ Strange Adventures of Miss Brown
is about at the end of its long run, and after to-
morrow Thornton and the muddy policeman will
break up the respectability of a select academy
no more. “ The Bookmaker ” goes up on Satur-
day.
** * *
The Electric Parlor at 162 Pitt-street,
Sydney, is one of the most comprehensive shows
just now going. It includes a whole collection of
kinetoscopes. an x-ray apparatus in which the
visitor can in spect his bones at the shortest notice,
phonographs, vitascope, and the inevitable cine-
matographe. The latter includes a very large
array of pictures, among them a prize-fight, a
bloodthirsty unpleasantness between two roosters,
an express-train, the whirlpool of Niagara, sundry
bits of scenery, leg-shows plain and colored,
camels, a breezy disturbance in a public-house,
and many other things. A very general desire for
bones centres round the x-ray apparatus, but to
those for whom bones are not everything the prize-
fight and the bloodthirsty roosters have much to
recommend them.
** * *
“ A Woman’s Reason,” which deserved to
flourish exceedingly, scored only a moderate suc-
cess at Melbourne Bijou, wherefore the Brough Co.
has already started a series of farewell revivals.
“Sowing the Wind” takes the lead in this interest-
ing procession; on Saturday (13) “Niobe” will
come along for three nights, followed by O. Wilde’s
“Woman of No Importance,” and for further
particulars see next issue. The season finishes on
April 2nd, when the Broughs, according to latest
announcements, will take a final leave of Mel-
bourne, and shake the dust of a fickle-minded
city from their restless feet. Some final ap-
pearances in Brisbane and Sydney are to
happen in due course; then a Maoriland tour,
concluding with a disbandment of the company.
In the meantime Australia would do well to beam
beseechingly upon its Robert Brough, that he may
be persuaded to say Au Revoir and not Good-bye.
** * *
“ The Prisoner of Zenda ” quits the
Princess’s on Friday night with a good business
record. On Saturday the Firm will stage “ Two
Little Vagabonds,” a play that is confidently ex-
pected to carry popular sympathies by storm. A
fortnight after the first production of “Two
Little Vags.,” at London Princess’s, prices were
doubled in obedience to the great law of supply
and demand, which exceptional circumstance
speaks for itself. Miss Florence Terriss and Miss
Marie Neilson make their Australian debut in the
name-parts, also the full strength of the “ Zenda ”
company will be brought to bear upon the new
show.
** * *
At the Royal they are continuing “The
Derby Winner ” regardless of changes at the other
houses, and Bland Holt’s broad comedy-smile
relaxeth not. TJp to now the last nights of that
sensational three-year-old haven’t been hinted at,
so the wicked Majah’s jockey is certain to take off
his jacket and accept a mount on the favorite
for another week or two. The Bulletin, by the
way, would like to remark that the Majah’s
jockey has no occasion for throwing in a statement
that he can “ ride the weight,” seeing that the
Epsom Derby is not a handicap race. But no
matter. Anything seems to be permissible in con-
nection with stage Derbies. Even the Majah’s
neglect to find another jockey, in place of the one
who slips him up at the last moment, makes no
apparent difference in the number of starters.
At Poverty Point.
“ Melba,” writes an Australian in England to The Bul-
letin, “ has suddenly given up her projected South
American trip and returned to Paris ; currently reported
that influenza is the cause, but if ‘ the whole truth and
nothing but the truth ’ were published, her more than
partial failure in German opera (Brunhilde) in the
‘ Fatherland ’ has more to do with this sudden cancelling
of dates than the ever-ready-to-fall-back-on influenza.
Nor is she on the list for Covent Garden this season ; her
demand for a higher ‘ screw ’ than was hers in former
years being promptly refused by the new management.
And yet there is no rising star to seriously challenge her
indisputable supremacy. So far, the only Australian
engaged for the opera is Lempriere Pringle (Hobart) as
prirno basso (he has seceded from the Carl Rosa Co. and
is now on his return journey from a very successful
American tour with Albani and Co.).
The petite daughter of a Melbourne racing magnate,
who was formerly disposed to worship Brownlow, the
baritone, seems now to have transferred some of her
idolatry to Ferris. Little incidents like this are rather
comforting to middle-aged non-professionals, by the
way. Brough’s leading juvenile is a curatish-looking
youth of something more or less than 40.
Some of the “ widest ” men seem to be the most suscep-
tible to theatrical glamor. Directly after the “Zenda”
company arrived in Melbourne a well-known local medico
went into ecstacies over the witching beauty (as he judged
it) of one of the lady principals. And yet a cold world,
viewing the vision off the stage, finds her merely good-
looking. The doctor fell a victim to glamor.
Most people, The Bulletin ventures to say, consider
Lauri’s get-up in “Matsa” (especially the , back view
thereof) as brutally and unpardonably vulgar, and regret
to see so talented a comedian in such a rig.
London, when the mail left, was still awaiting the
arrival of Lalla Miranda and Mary Boucieault (said to be
Melba No. 2) from “ Gay Paree,” but still “ thej’ come
not.” Miss Boucieault, according to a private letter,
entertains not like an embryo prima donna, but like one
who has already won thousands from a generous public.
Arthur Deane, the Sydney baritone (writes a Bulletin
correspondent from London), having finished his tour
with the “Merry Madcap” Co., is looking for “some-
thing good,” and is apparently so satisfied that his time
will come that he has refused to sign on with Carl Rosa
for ’9B. Unfortunately for him, the baritone market at
present is very congested.
Mesmerist Kennedy writes from San Francisco:—
“ Good old Bulletin, —Shall be with you soon. I leave
here with above attraction—Prof. D. M. Bristol’s EqueS-
curriculum : equine wonders, 30 perfectly-educated
horses—per s.s. Alameda, March 4th. Please get out your
roaster; you did not make it hot enough for me on my
last visit. I know that if your paper burns me I will
make money. We have a very good show, and if you are
in good humor you may like it. Watch our educated
mules during the whole evening-see i f they do sh °*
more intelligence than all the staff of The Bulletin.
Remember, the mules can kick ; don’t go near the hind
part of a mule. Any mention of this show you may make
will greatly oblige yours truly, E. A. Kennedy. The
Bulletin is glad to find Kennedy travelling at last in
company with mules. If he travels with « lule ® |
enough he will be kicked by a mule, and will be laid out
if fairly struck anywhere except on the cheek.
It was on the ground of the lady’s weak health that Dr.
Wilmott objected to his daughter (Mrs. Maesmore Morris)
appearing at Melb. Princess’s. However, the objection
being, as a matter of course, over-ruled, papa Wilmott
made the best of the situation.
Dan Barry returns to Melbourne at Easter to have
another go at the disastrous Haleck.
It is now arranged that Mrs. Potter and Bellew will
appear at the Princess’, in their spicy piece, on Easter
Saturday. There is a fortnight to be filled before Chas.
Frohmann and 00. can arrive.
Cecchi, who died last week of heart-disease, was the
original music-master of Melba. He was never much of a
tenor, nothing so good as flutey little Coy. It is a sur-
prise to hear he was an architect of skill, and, working in
Reed and Barnes’s office, responsible for some of the
elegance of Melb. Public Library. His standing grievance
was that his “seexyaire” tuition of Melba was ignored.
“Haresfoot: ,r Ada Ward must now be 60 years old.
She was always nervous and excitable, and could not be
doing much good as leading actress of that ma,gmficent
company whioh, it is cabled, she has ‘disbanded, but
the Salvation Army will find her a lady white elephant on
salary. Ada used to narrate how she was in Pans during
the siege, and, like Sarah Bernhardt, ministered to the
wounded. Surely this was not another vision.”
Melb. : “ Rickards packs off to Loudon again for
another hamper, having taken the tissue paper off the
last bottle in the other, which has included the Allisons,
Chirgwin, Coleman, Crackles, Crossleys, Durhams, God-
frey, Granville, Hertz, Lentons, Maie, Robin and Hood,
Tennyson and O’Gorman, Vaidis.”
Haresfoot : “ Gladstone, the father of the Australian
staire, worthily sustains his little part in ‘The Prisoner of
Zenda.’ Macready, at an amateur performance, was
asked which performer he liked best, and replied, ‘ The
man who brought in the letter.’ ”
Theorbo : “ I noticed Buzzi pensively listening in
Bourke-st. (Melb.) last night to the really magnificent
strains of the red-capped German brass-band discoursing
the Benediction of the Poniards, from 1 The Huguenots.’
Buzzi was a fine Marcel, of the meagre order, as distin-
guished from the Falstaffian of Farquharson. Shall we
ever hear grand-opera again?”
A man was fined in Melbourne the other da}' for smug-
gling in a 101 b. tin of butter. At least Melb. dramatic
critics can no longer complain that they do not enjoy the
benefits of the “ settled policy.”
Paradis: “Knowles, like every genuine comedian, is
tortured with an idea that the public fancy him a one-
part man, or no part at all, merely a buffoon in his one
droll rig. Sothern got melancholy over the interminable
run of ‘ Dundreary.’ So Jefferson with ‘Rip,’ and ‘Fritz’
made Emmet drunk. Macready feared, at one time, he
would be condemned to act Rob Roy.”
W. F. Hawtrey, of the new “ Zenda ” combination, is a
brother of the Hawtrey, now managing the Comedy
Theatre, who made a fortune out of “ The Private
Secretary.” Miss Elliott Page comes from Hawtrey’s co.
“ Two Little Larrikins,” the melodrama in which Hilda
Spong is now playing the tearful heroine in London, is the
most loose-jointed play the writer ever saw. The way in
which burglars saunter in and out of drawingrooms while
the owners are present, the manner in which ambulances
and other effects appear on the stage without request-or re-
ference of any kind, and the mode in which the characters
meet and disappear without one word of explanation in the
text, is simply astounding.
Billy Walshe sang at the London Lyric Club on Sunday
evening, 10th January (writes a Bulletin correspondent),
when he had for a colleague on the programme the idol
of the halls, Marie Lloyd. Among the audience were
Henri Kowalski, Signor Billgreeno Verdi and Max Rown,
whom Frances Saville is not going to divorce, after all.
Bach’s Passion Music is underlined at the Melb. Angli-
can Cathedral. Half-a-crown will be charged under guise
of subscription. This indicates that full oratorio per-
formances are to be given, as in some English Cathedrals.
Indeed, the place don’t pay.
Signor Schiavi, the eminent bassoonist, has left on a
hurried visit to Europe, but will shortly resume the
conductorship of North Shore Orchestral Society. Signora
Schiavi is an excellent ’cellist, and is a great favorite at
sacred concerts in Sydney.
Dr. Louis Henry is “ shakin’ ’em up” down South with
the idea of making music a conspicuous element in the
Federation shivoo. The Bulletin trusts that all the
necessary “ God save the Queen ” will be played on a
jewsharp.
S.S. : “ The society beauties introduced as spectacular
effects at Melb. Princess’s fail, apparently because of their
niggardliness with the greasepaint—the result of inex-
perience probably, or possibly arising from their fear of
injuring the original complexion. As it is, the much-
photoed Mrs. Morris would make a very poor picture
beside many of the Firm’s chorus-girls—Maie Saqui, for
instance, or Minnie Arkaline. I see a Bulletin corres-
pondent ascribes the appearance of the “ sassiety ” ladies
on the stage to overweening vanity. True, probably.
One I know to be extremely vain, having seen her in all
her store clothes pass a large mirror without even a
glance at the bewitching reflection. Always a sign of
egotistical self-satisfaction in woman, this.”
The passengers on the Orizaba, which brought Ferris
(of the Brough Oo.) from ’Ome, tell amusing stories of the
aesthetic jeune premier. He affected a dressing-gown of
purple velvet, lined with the most becoming heliotrope
quilted satin. A very swagger grey felt hat he wore was
the admiration of all the women, and the envy, hatred,
and malice of the men. This, however, was swept off his
curly head into the blue deep but three days after leaving
London. But, to give the masher his due, Ferris shows
but an indifferent face to the many bright eyes that take
aim at him from below the footlights.
Our acquaintance, Harry Kellar, is conjuring cock-of-
the-walk in America, wizard Herman having just died,
after making and spending fabulous sums, like Bouci-
cault. Curious heredity. Hermann, senior, was a rich
German merchant, with a natural, irrepressible sleight of
hand, which he detested. It ran all through the family.
How the H’s dominate in conjuring : Hermanns, Houdin,
Heller, Haselmayer, Hercat, Hertz—and Handerson, says
’Enery ’Awkins.
Ada Crossley has sent £lO towards the Melb. fund for a
memorial over the late Madame Simonsen’s grave. In a
warm letter, enclosing the “ tenner,” A.C. writes : “ Dur-
ing her lifetime, it always gave me special pleasure to
acknowledge all that I owe to her admirable teaching, and
in death I would like to pay further tribute to one who
was incomparable as a teacher and invaluable as a friend.”
Florence Young's husband, Mr. Rivington, was not
long ago absorbing “ colonial experience ”in N.Q. He is
fair and rather below medium height. Also he is reserved
in manner, lives at the Oxford when in Sydney, and ii
related to the big publishing Arm of same name. *
Henry Tinney, director of the orchestra at Frascati’a
restaurant, London, dropped dead the other night whilst
conducting a selection from “ Carmen.” The old musical
name calls up memories of H. J. Byron’s burlesque in
which one of the Greek gods returned home from a h’ofi.
day to find his goddess engaged in high saasiety jinks
regardless of expense. She had engaged Coote and
Tinney’s band. Quoth the god—“ And Coote and Tinney
too 1 Why, coute qui coute, I could keeck-oot the lot."
The first-night success of Bracy’s production of the
“Beggar Student,” at Sydney Lyceum, is more pro-
nounced in view of the facts that not six of the cast were
experienced before the footlights, that the co. and Braev
were utter strangers five weeks before, that many of the
chorus and ballet had never previously appeared upon
the stage.
Whelan, of the Bracy co., a Melb. youth, promises to be-
come an excellent mimic. His imitation of R. G. Knowles
quite fetched the first-night audience. He never appeared
professionally before, except in Westralia, but he has been
an amateur for a long time. R. G. Knowles, by the way,
opines that nobody in the world can imitate him.
N. : “A purple-patchy interviewer was sent by the Aas
to Brough, the other day, but stuck in the writing by
attributing the former drop-scene of the Royal to the
Bijou, ‘ Thespians Leaving Deserted Greece,' and suitably
improved it, as the parsons say, on Bob and Mrs. Bob.
The Royal drops, before the Thespians, were Shakes-
peare’s House, Bacchus and Ariadne, and Lake Maggiore,
burnt almost new in the fire. Hennings painted these
magnificences.”
Brough, as His Lordship, in “ A Woman’s Reason,” was
the image of the best-known Melb. anarchist.
Melb. : “ The friends of demised Pietro Cecchi were
astounded, a time ago, by placards!hat one Signor Cecchi
would, on a certain date, drive a- four-in-hand of geese,
with a tub, down the Yarra, but this professor did not
turn up.”
Julia Spencer, of Bracy’s Opera Co., is from Melbourne.
She first- appeared eight or nine years ago with Williamson
and Musgrove, and played Ariel in “ The Tempest.” She
did a twelve-months tour in the States with Marie
Tempest in comic-opera.
Miss Mabelle Darley, in the trying part of Laura in “The
Beggar Student,” made a great hit on her first night with
a Sydney audience. She is a Melb. girl who has been
singing for a couple of years, mostly as an amateur in
“ Giroflb-Girofla,” “ Marjorie,” “ Pinafore.” Until Satur-
day night she had never appeared in a prominent part.
She was deathly nervous when singing “ Joy and Grief";
her extended hands trembled like leaves. But she charmed
the hearts of the audience, and delighted Mr. and Mrs.
Bracy.
Carl Hertz opened his Maoriland tour with a great bang
at Auckland. The Opera House was crowded half-an-
hour before starting time, and the show caught on un-
mistakeably, according to all accounts. It is very little
more than a one-man show either —Orchestra, Hertz;
more Orchestra, Cinematographe ; more Orchestra, more
Hertz and Gorsavethequeen ! Manager Lohr and the
Wizard have been exchanging smiles by cable.
Duncan Macallum, seeking to secure the Bourke (N.S.W.)
hall for the cinematographe, found that it was engaged for
the whole month ! Bourke, concludes Duncan, must be
the theatrical paradise.
A London actor is expected to shave his head to act a
bald man.
Freetrade is badly needed in the Victorian
church. Ex-pastor Jones is now prohibited from
officiating at funerals except in his undertaking
capacity, and another rev. brother is no longer an
attache to the jeweller’s shop where his matri-
monial services were on tap gratis to buyers of the
wedding-ring.
The Earl of Kilmorey, now visiting Aus-
tralia, was in Sydney, as Lord Newry, when the
Duke of Edinburgh was shot by O’Farrell. Newry
was one of the Duke’s party, and, like many
others at the time, believed an Irish insurrection
at hand. S.M. Herald, by the way, does not say
whether he has been accorded the ‘ ‘ well-deserved
honor of honorary membership of the Union Club.”
What their own constituencies think of
certain members was hinted at in the Vic. Federal
Convention elections. Essendon gave to two other
candidates a greater number of votes than it gave
to Deakin; Bogong preferred one candidate (the
Premier) to Isaacs ; Richmond preferred three to
Trenwith ; East Bourke Boroughs, three to Berry
and ten to Hume Cook; Geelong, three to Hig-
gins ; Hawthorn, four to Murrain Smith ; Maldon,
three to M‘lntyre ; Williamstown, seven to Styles;
Ballarat West, seven to Vale ; and Mornington,
eighteen to L. L. Smith. Several of these facts,
although not necessarily all, point significantly to
weak seats, and will, no doubt, bring forward
aspiring successors at next general election. Pea-
cock and Turner alone topped the poll in their
own preserves. And so it was in N.S. Wales,
where severalcandidatesavowedly only entered for
the purpose of seeing how they stood, as compared
with other men, in the opinion of certain con-
stituencies.

Messrs. Pitt, Son and Badgery, Ltd., have added
to their well-known stock and station agency business
that of wool and produce salesmen. Mr. Edward N. Row,
one of the big leading minds in his calling, will conduct
the new branch. The"firm neither directly nor indirectly
will entertain any interest in produce committed to its
care except that of realising the highest price, and
buyers are to understand that they will compete only
with legitimate competitors. The big convenient stores
on Circular Quay and Macquarie-street are now open for
the reception of consignments, from a few horns or a bag
of cow-hair to 1000 hides or bales of wool. The firm will
prosecute the new branch of business with all its well-
known capacity and energy.*

Melbourne Board of Works pot off its .£750,000
3J per cent, loan locally at £lOO 9s. Bd. This is by far the
best that the Board has done up to date, either in Mel-
bourne or London. The question now is—can the Govern-
ment pet off its big conversion loan in the same market
at 3 per cent, and realise par. ? One thing is about cer-
ta'n ; no Australian province could float a 3 per cent,
loan in London now' at par. It must be done in Australia
or not at all. Melbourne is just now the better market of
the two ; Board of Works debentures sell in London at a
Erice which yields the buyer £3 11s. per cent. ; in Mel-
ourne the buyer is content with less than £3 10s.

Vi j. Supreme Court has formally sanctioned the
writi’ig-off, by the Commercial Bank of Australia, of
£1,2( 0,000 ordinary capital. This means that all the
capii U and reserves, as they were before the 1893 recon-
stru> tion—about £2,000,000 in all—have evaporated. The
allef ;d total private wealth of Victoria in the boom days
was about £400,000,000. This one institution alone
ma res a considerable hole in that beautiful calculation.

To all appearance, most of the big brewing co’s
of Melbourne will have to go broke and the whole beer
business start again on a new basis. The boom, as usual,
is the cause of the trouble. In the good days the brewery
co’s bought up freehold and leasehold hotels wholesale,
with the idea that the great public thirst w'as immortal.
Now the money paid for goodwill is all gone ; the few
pubs, that still have a genuine goodwill attached to them
are more than counterbalanced by the ones which no
customer in his senses would* take away unless he was
paid removal expenses. In many oases people have to be
paid a salary for remaining in charge of the desolate pub.,
which the brewery isdoath to abandon lest it should some
day become of value again. Taxes have to be paid on the
freehold pubs., and rent and taxes on the leasehold ones ;
and interest on the money borrowed to buy them—which
money sometimes runs into hundreds of thousands-is an-
other' awful item. Also there are repairs; and, against
all this, many of the places only pay wages—some not
even that. If some of the big breweries would abandon
several dozen hotels apiece and pay the landlords to take
several dozen more off their hands, they would be vastly
better off ; but vyhen they took the alleged value of these
hotels out of the balance-sheet they would be visibly in-
solvent—at present they are only invisibly insolvent.
Meanwhile, some small new breweries, which own no
hotels and have no borrowed money to pay interest on,
are making profits, while the old lumbering concerns
lumber on to destruction and hopelessly hope that some-
thing will turn up. , , ,
Still another English fire-insurance co. starts
business in Australia. The newest arrival is the Eastern
Counties Co., a respectable, second-class institution which
hangs out in the grimy provincial town of Hull. This
makes the several-dozenth foreign fire office doing busi-
ness in Australia, and still the absentee-tax cometh not.
New foreign insurance co.’s, English, Scotch, German,
Austrian, Swiss, Italian, Japanese, &c., are now opening
in this country at the rate of about one a month, and the
situation grows interesting.

Youn<' Australian mine, Cobar, N.S.W. : “ The
manager’s report showed that 2411 tons had been crushed
for 6940 z. of gold. The financial position is sound, and
the mine looks as well as ever.” The fact that last year
it averaged several times as much is, as usual, not
mentioned. They then worked a rich streak in the ore-
body, and it has vanished. #
After many years spent in crushing tens of thou-
sands of tons to pay wages and an excessive royalty, the
Sunlight Co., N.S.W., has had a good year, paying three
divs settling a big overdraft, and putting the mine in
good shape for this year. Manager Tate also speaks very
cheerfully of the future. One of the few N.S.W. gold-
mining co’s with plucky 4
A Cobar (N.S.W.) paper reports the yield of
2500 z from two tons from the Queen of the Earth, W.A.,
and wonders why it has been ignored by investors so long.
Too late. But why trouble about the sale of so rich a
mine at all? Keep on crushing.
Advt. in Sydney D.T. “ Wanted to buy, a
gold-mine ; also, a mine for flotation.” Truly a distinc-
tion with a difference. The writer knows of 1000 of the
latter for sale, and will undertake for every mine pur-
chased to throw eighteen in for nix. +
After the big things—immediate divs, &c.—pre-

of the shares during the last few weeks is another douche.

A low-grade N.S.W. gold-mine— the Occidental
(Cobar) —crushed last half-year 4820 tons, for 830 oz
lldwt.—within a shade of 3Jdwt. per ton. Even this
more than paid. The yeats run added live . heads to
the battery, and there is a credit balance of t 1391. The

breakers, self-feeders, and the motive power for the run-

Mines Minister Smith says N.S.W. Mines De-
oartment was never before in so efficient a state as now.
&ow can any department be efficient while it is controlled
by a man who knows nothing of mining, and is merely a
weak joint in the tail of the Govt. ? That has, except
perhaps in the days of Copeland, always been its un-
happy position. It'should be controlled by three (there
is safety in numbers) highly-paid expert commissioners
who, if they attended to business should profitably spend
every second of their time. The Minister now talks of
consolidating the N.S.W. mining law. The three com-
missioners would probably introduce a new and simple
code preserving the few good principles of Australian
mining law and adopting the chief features of the U.S.
mining law.

Alick Forrest said at the recent Perth mining-
conference that W.A. Parliament would never listen to
the proposal to give freeholds after a certain amount of
work had been done, thus relieving mine-owners from all
obligations of labour; if such a proposal were carried it
would mean that half their miners would have to leave
the province for want of work. Another delegate, Kerr,
was even more candid. He said the proposal was designed
in the interests of “boomsters;” but it was time the
British investor found out that gold was not too abundant
inWestralia. It was also time they admitted that the
day of reckoning between the British investors and
Westralia was coming. It was not far off now, and the
sooner it came the better. Yet the W.A. papers, in-
judicious enough to print this, continue to talk of another
greater London boom in March. The chairman (Dr.
Simon) was cunning enough to ask Kerr to confine him-
self to the question.

The Coolgardie Gold Mining and Prospecting
Syndicate started in Westralia with a capital of £l50 —
Pearce, Brookman and, we think, C. De Rose being the
prospectors. A third of the money went in outfit, another
third had vanished by the time they reached Coolgardie,
and the balance soon followed. The capital of the syndi-
cate was increased two or three times. Now the
market-value of the properties pegged out by these pros-
pectors for the syndicate amounts to over five millions.
Thev include the Great Boulder, Lake View, Associated
Mines, Ivanhoe, Lake View South and Extended, Cool-
gardie Mint, and Boulder No. 1. Several big distributions
of cash and shares have taken place—chiefly shares—and
those held by the co. to-day are valued at £70,884.

Clarke and Co., of Melb., issue monthly the
best of all the brokers’ circulars. It gives far more
accurate information of Westralian mines than news-
papers—which, when one thinks of it, is not saying much.
Like most other things, including the writer perhaps, it
has its weaknesses. It says of the Golden Bar : “ This
mine of disappointments and bad management in the
past will yet, under able guidance, astonish those who are
never tired of decrying Coolgardie.” Areally good mine
will stand a lot of bad management. Coolgardie has
decried itself. More British gold has been sunk in its
mines than will probably ever be got out of them. Its
history is briefly—unanimity of liars in the working of
mining jobs. The Lord forbid, for the sake of the mining
industry, that its history will ever be repeated in any
other part of the world. In that history the Golden
Bar has nothing to brag about, and it will take more gold
than is likely to come out of the mine to redeem it from
the degradation into which it has sunk.
Coolgardie : “ A fine slug of pure gold, weighing
530 z., has been brought in from Mt. Margaret; also ; one
from Siberia weighing 210 z.” The world is not taking a
mad interest in Coolgardie slugs at present— a very good
thing for the world. t
r In Westralian mining companies especially,
“ Extended ” to “Suspended” would appear to be the
natural transition.

Frank Nicolas was banqueted the night before
leaving London, and, of course, made another W.A.
boom speech. He said (as reported in a London
paper) the depression in Westralia was due to over-
capitalisation and insufficiency of working capital.
Some people had thought want of gold might have
had something to do with it, but that, is a mistake.
According to Mr. Nicolas, the water difficulty is all a
myth. To prove it, he refers to a time when they
had a flood. He predicts failure for the W.A. Govt,
scheme to pump 5,000,000 gallons a day to Mt. Burgess.
The Govt, of Vic. once had a similar scheme for the mines
of Bendigo, but with the pitiful result that before the
water arrived the mines had plenty. Like other of
Nicolas’s statements, this is incorrect. The Cobban water-
scheme was to supply all the towns between Malmesbury
and Bendigo, and not the mines. Every goldfield in
the world with a yearly rainfall of less than XOin. has a
water difficulty; and all the gas by Nicolas and other
boomsters will not remove it. The writer notes that his
company—the Coolgardie Goldfields (pW.)— ts
50 000 shares for working capital, but what this has to do
with his sanguine speeches the present writer does not
pretend to know. » * *
Somebody has handed writer a copy of the Hit-
or-Miss mine prospectus, an awful document in the light
of the cruel battery truth. Many hundreds of tons of
4dwt stone have been crushed, the battery has shut up,
shares have shut down, exemption has been secured by a
strike and, altogether, poor Bull is in a pitiable condition.
This prospectus foreshadowed quite a different ending.
J O Oxley reported :—“ Upwards of 50 shafts and cos-
teens have been sunk to various depths up to 100 ft and
the reef proved for a distance of two miles, the w ulth in
many places being over 20ft., and even up to 50ft, the ore
being of high grade. I estimate the ore to yield lOoz. to
the ton, the gold being free and evenly distributed.
Other glowing statements were made by other people, but
none came up to Oxley for emphasis. Oxley was also the
vendor rnd promoter, and fixed the price Bull had to pay
— v i z -t 13) 000, £45,000 in cash, the balance in fully-pail
shares ; £40,000 working capital was also put up to work
this great mine. Extracts from newspapers were also pub-
lished, one taken from the Financial News : —“ Last
week the owners dollied IOOOoz., and lOOoz. were cleaned
up from one shot.” The W.A. Review The Hit-or-
Miss will probably prove the finest mine in Western Aus-
tralia.” Oxley has come out from London to see to things.
The manager resigned, disgusted with the whole business.
Unlike Oxlev, he had nothing to do with the float. As
soon as his back was turned, a circular was issued in
London saying the failure was entirely due to mismanage-
ment, a clean sweep had been made, and there was 20,000
tons of rich ore in sight. It also happens that a few days
later the manager’s exposure reached London. Oxley
should now vindicate himself by keeping the 20-head
battery going on the 20 to 50 feet and lOoz. reef of free
gold and thereby produce 10,000 oz. a month. Why have
a strike for the sake of 10s. a week under these circum-
stances?

The Bulletin is open to do business with any
man or firm that has preserved intact copies of the pro-
spectuses issued in London of alleged Westralian gold-
mines. This paper has received, as it expected, so much
condemnation when it stood alone in the criticism of
W.A. “ wild-cats ” that it wants to know how it will come
out on the average—whether it has to stick another
feather in its tail, or apologise to the army of Westralian
boomsters who are at this moment in great distress, and
want all the consolation they can get.
* * • *
Westralian newspapers, the writer is sorry to
see, are singing quite a different tune now the boom is
past and the harvest therefrom is over. Thus Geraldton
Express : “ The booming of worthless properties by im-
pecunious newspaper-proprietors and mining-experts is
detrimental to genuine mining investment.” You don’t
say! “The evil, though it exists on the Murchison, is
not so bad as in the southern fields, where over 1000
leases, held in collusion by jumping syndicates, have been
forfeited, and upwards of 70 on the Murchison, to say
nothing of the utterly worthless properties successfully
placed in England, all of which will assist to knock the
bottom out of bogus mining ventures. W.A., as a legiti-
mate-field for investment, is discounted by the number of
swindles that have been perpetrated by unscrupulous ad-
venturers and their allies, corrupt pressmen and mining-
experts.” It gives the name of the paper which recently
exposed an attempted swindle, and the name of the mine,
but also alludes to the other duffers the same paper con-
tinues to write up, and naturally wants to know why one
particular mine is singled out for exposure.
• * * *
Fortune of War, Murchison: “ A very hard
porphyritic dyke has come in contact with the reef at
200 ft. ‘ The reef is expected to improve greatly in quality
when this disturbance is passed through.” Nothing
occurs to disturb the regularity of calls—the 17th is now
due.
* * * *
The few great mines of Kalgoorlie are never
allowed to suffer a week for the want of newspaper advt.
The long wire re the Boulder lode at the 300 ft. level is a
fair sample : “ The most important find in the colony for
many months.” “ Lode shows here greater signs of per-
manency than anywhere else.” “It settles for ever all
doubts about the soft formations living in hard country—
the lode here is as hard as cast steel.” “It is 6ft. wide
and is worth 3soz. The ore is sulphide, but its richness
is due to telluride.” “ At the 300 ft. level the lode is much
wider and richer than at the 200 ft. level.’’
* * * •
What has become of the Great Oversight mine,
W.A., the booming boss of which was presented with a
gun in Perth last year? Alas! we are asked the same
question of a great many other W.A. mines which floated
with ease in the boom.
* « » *
More sensation: “The Associated Mines have
received an additional 2000 ore-bags, and bagging is in
progress.” Hasn’t any mine out there bought any long-
handled shovels lately? If so, why is not the fact wired
across to the Argus, S.M. Herald, and other eastern
papers? ,
A Westralian Govt. Gazette notice declares
the forfeiture of over 600 gold leases for non-payment of
rent. As before stated, there will be more leases forfeited
than pegged in W.A. this year. The boom cometh not in
March. Bull this month, at any rate, will not resemble
the hare in his madness.

dreds of others being thrown up, hundreds of exemp-
tions, the gold-producers’ mines full-handed, unemployed
agitations in Coolgardie, people still coming in every

flowing, the Forrest Govt., which has long lived on jam,

two or three other mines to these, and you have half the
product of W.A.—in which considerably over a hundred
English cos. alone are operating.
Bull collectively, presided over by Remember-
Me-No-More Robinson, demands a reduction of W.A.
labor conditions, a permanent title when a substantial
sum has been spent on gold leases, security for costs from
jumpers, and value for improvements in the case of for-
feiture. He will probably get it, too ; but, if he wants
another boom, he must make it. The only boom now on
is in exemptions. , « *
Wilmot Extended, Gympie, 112 tons for 20740 z.
If this happened with any Westralian mine what a song
we should have about it! It is the new, never the old
mine, that creates sensation, and the public knows the
vagaries of the Wilmot and Ellen Harkins mines. They
were opened some 20 years ago by working miners who
for some years were impoverished by calls and ridiculed
for their folly. This month—March—in ’B4, the Extended
struck it mighty rich, putting through 470 tons for
10 9440 z. It paid the record div. of £1 a share, £36,000.
The same year it also crushed 3775 tons for 28,0500 z.
No 1 South Wilmot put through 1100 tons for 13,8280 z. ;
Ellen Harkins, 2177 tons for 14,7280 z. Ellen’s first crush-
ing was 70 tons, yielding exactly 70oz. to the ton, and 70
times 70—49000 z. The Wilmot Extended also did some-
thing in seventies—paying £70,000 in divs. from the pro-
duct of 70ft. of stoping. These and many other equally
rich things of Gympie were got without “ foreign capital,
and their getting awakened no boom in Bull.^
Valuation of Charters Towers registered co’s,
£2 220 000. Divs. over calls show a profit of 7i per cent.,
and if calls are allowed as capital expenditure it is equal
to 11J4 per cent. Let Bull compare this with his mining
investments in Westralia, and weep.

The cyanide patent as amended in Queensland
does not expire till 1901.
The general absence of fire-damp in Queensland
coal-mines has led colliery-proprietors there to trust to
natural ventilation, although the Q. Act is framed on the
English Act of ’72, and provides for “ adequate ventila-
tion.” There are no return air-courses, and the inevitable
presence of carbonic oxide is slowly and cumulatively un-
dermining the constitutional and physical powers of Q.
coal-miners, and inflicting noticeable secondary injury on
their progeny. Yet the Mining Laws Commission recently
appointed by the Nelson Government does not include
one member who has the slightest inner or practical know
ledge of the working of Q. coal-mines, although the
leader of the Opposition, Glassey, was a working coal-
miner. The most glaring faults lie in the non-administra-
tion of the existing law, and to this point more especially
the attention of the oommission is directed.

Mt. Morgan, Australasia’s boss gold - mine,
seems to have settled down for a monthly production of
13,f1000z. from about 8000 tons of ore. When the works,

lower grade ore, are finished, the output will probably go
to and remain for some years at 16,0000 z. a month
Truly, a marvellous mine.

Brief, and to the point, report on some Charters
Towers mines, from a mining-man whose opinion the
writer values : “ Kelly’s Queen Block—Straight shaft
1,450 ft. deep, and now sinking on the underlie ; some rich
stone in the sink. In the east drive there is about 18in.
of fair stone ; 250 tons from drives crushed for loz. 12dwt.
yield. I think this mine should do well. Victoria G.M.A.
—Reef runs from a foot to 15in., but goes in and out a
good deal. They nave a large block of ground between
No. 2 and 3 levels west, and a good block along the Band
of Hope boundary, at the bottom of the shaft towards the
Papuan, where some rich stone was got. Also a big block
of good stone on the east of the shaft, between No. 8 and
10 levels, and down to the bottom level, No. 12. This
seems a new make from the Victoria and Caledonia Block.
The latter should be a good mine, but I have not been
down yet. The Vic. G.M.A. is by no means exhausted, as
some people suppose. The Phoebe is one of the pet mines
here, and, though of small acreage, it is good. Clark’s
Worcester and Victory should prove a steady div.-
payer. Clark, who controls half and owns one-third,
in the face of much opposition got the tailings of last
crushing saved at a cost of i 5 and sold them to a cyanide
co. for £llO. Seems curious that the generally level-
headed mining-men of the Towers object to saving their
tailings. They are married to their mills, and don’t want
to admit that they lose gold, but the fact that there are
about 30 small cyanide plants treating tailings from the
creeks below the batteries, and all apparently doing well,
should be proof enough. Three miles below one mill is a
plant treating a deposit of tailings. The circumstances
of the big explosion in the Brilliant Deep Levels, in respect
to which there is a big reward offered, are suspicious.
This mine has a fancy chimney-stack, picked out in blue
and white bricks, with a masonic emblem and other deco-
rations, but so far has not struck much gold. East
Mexican : two levels from the Brilliant are up to the
boundary of this mine, and from the lower one they are
rising up on 3ft. of good stone. In the level above they
have a good reef, which goes in and out a bit, and last
week got some fine specimens in it. The mine is greatly
handicapped by having to work on sufferance of the
Brilliant. They have only two men where the rich speci-
mens came from, and the air is as hot as Sheol. They are
going to haul by-and-by through the Brilliant Block shaft,
over quarter of a mile away, till they are connected with
their own shaft. At the price (£lO,OOO for the mine), the
shares are good enough.”
* • * *
Coal costs £2 per ton landed at the furnaces,
Charters Towers, and that price is prohibitive. The
Transcontinental Railway would take coal from Clermont
to that field for about 255., and this would enable several
mines to join the div.-list. Something will soon have to be
done, as there is not a respectable stick left within 20
miles of the Towers.

After weary years the indomitable John Clark,
of Clark’s Brilliant and Worcester mine, C. Towers, has

Bendigo mine-managers complain in their Asso-

in Australia. The secretary lately said that some of them
were not getting £4 a week. Entirely true. But, per
contra, it is claimed that, as most of the Bendigo mines
are directed by Bendigo boards, the managers don’t re-
quire to know anything of finance or have any business
ability. They are' it is claimed, little more than under-
ground bosses. This, at any rate, has been the view
almost invariably adopted by the Broken Hill directors,
who have, with one or two notable exceptions, fought shy
of Vic. managers as general managers for this reason,
while welcoming them as shift-bosses.

Tasmanian mining scribe:—“ Some decent allu-

cemetery. A small syndicate has been formed to prospect
for a lode, which must be parallel to, and not far from,
the Native Youth.” Which suggests that in these days of
improved mining appliances and persistent boomers
people cannot be too careful re the sort of jewellery they
bury their friends in.

Three months hence the 60th anniversary
of Victoria’s accession falls due, and no one has
fairly started to organise any great Australian
grovel for the occasion. Someonte has suggested
that the entrance to Sydney Harbor should be
christened the Quern's Gate, and someone else
has proposed that a huge subscription be started
and a big charity be founded ; also, it has been
proposed that three pictures of Australian scenery
be painted at a cost of £ 1000 and presented to Her
Gracious. These are about all the ideas up to
date, and they suggest that loyalty is suffering
badly from ‘ ‘ that tired feeling. ”
The Bulletin takes this opportunity to pro-
pound its idea of what a real, useful, healthy
grovel would be like. It advises that on the day
of celebration the whole able-bodied country popu-
lation should turn out and remove the stumps off
the roads. Also, that in the cities the police-force
should be permanently doubled, so that the larri-
kin who heaves road-metal will have twice as

Very gilded personage enters fashionable

“ Oh — well, I’ll — er—have two.”

perial Metropolitan hotel for me? ”
good a chance of being run in as at pre-
sent. Then, that a new standing army
should be started, and every able-bodied
male convicted of larrikinism for the third
time should be run into it for three years,
for his own mental and physical reformation and
the general comfort of the community. It pro-
poses that all the banana-skins should be cleaned
off the streets, and anybody throwing more skins
on them be fined <£2o ; that the police should
begin to have less difficulty in finding unlawful
gambling-shops, seeing that almost everybody in
Sydney and Melbourne can find 20 any day while
the force hardly discovers one in six months ; that
Wexford-street, Sydney, should be burned to the
ground ; and that the tote, and Tattersall’s sweep,
and the drink-traffic should be made State mono-
polies. Further, Max Hirsch should be bound
over in his own recognisances to be in a calm frame
of mind, and to be strictly accurate in his Foreign-
trade statistics for three months ; and Premier
Reid should be compelled to take healthy exercise
by Act of Parliament; and Duncan Gillies be sent
into permanent exile ; and Parson Madgwick be
compelled to present an illuminated address to the
Cardinal.
It is also hereby suggested that every Australian
should be required to wash that day and have his
hair cut; that then and thereafter every tall hat
which appears at the theatre should be confiscated
and jumped upon by a duly-authorised function-
ary ; that the N.S.W. line from Cobar to Broken
Hill, and the Vic. line from Bairnsdale to Eastern
Gippsland should be finished by public subscrip-
tion ; and that the Melbourne Harbor Trust should
spend the whole day on the Yarra, while some one
stirs up the black and geririy stream with long
poles to bring out the true inwardness of its
fragrance. The Bulletin is further of opinion
that Crick, John Norton. Freeman Kitchen,
Attorney-General Want, and Meagher should go
out fishing together on that day of good feeling
and general reconciliation, and that the Queens-
land National Bank should be definitely closed
up, and North Queensland should rise in general
insurrection, and get separation or burst. And if,
in addition to all this, arrangements could be
made to reduce the price of gas, and every
gaunt ’bus-horse got an extra feed of oats, and
every preacher in Australia was called upon
to find security that he would thereafter deliver
his sermon in an ordinary voice and not in a
broken-hearted wail; and it was provided by law
that the sixpenny peaches inside the shop shall be
at least half as large as the threepenny ones in
the window—then this paper submits that it would
be a useful and respectable celebration, and one
that the country might be proud of, and this
great nation could then go to the Zoo and have a
penny ride on the elephant with a light heart.

A weird crowd in Adelaide, calling it-
self the Local Government Association of South
Australia, has decided to send the following
address to the Queen, congratulating her on her
Diamond Jubilee: “Your Majesty’s Australian
subjects have ever shown the deepest attachment
to your throne and person, and are now striving,
as a fitting crown to the glories of your august
reign, to inaugurate the federal union of the Aus-
tralian colonies.” Rather !
The four winds blow;
Tides rise and fall;
The sun doth glow
Imperial ;
Potatoes grow
Not quite so small
This year as in past years they used to be
In honor of the Diamond Jubilee.
Night brings the morn,
And men awake,
And babes are born,
And measles take;
And we, forlorn,
Get stomach-ache
Through grovelling—for loyal worms are we—
In honor of Her Gracious’ Jubilee.

The filthy city of Perth, W.A., is now
from a sanitary point of view, a perfect hell-upon-
earth, and in excellent condition to act as a nest
for the bubonic plague.
It is true, al-
though not gen-
erall3 r known,
that the “ first-
class ” business
houses of Sydney
keep for private
circulation a
“b’ack-book” in
which are record-
ed the names, an-
tecedents, friends
and all i known
particulars of un-
faithful clerks,
dickey canvas-
sers, and all some-
time employes
who have been
addicted tocrook-
ed ways an d sharp

ceives a big an-
nual income from
a ringof first-class
houses for keep-
ing the principals
supplied with full
information as to
the female ac-
quaintances, se-
cret vices, rate of
living and other
little particulars
of their head em-
ployes. Many a
smart man, after
a first default has
been compro-
mised in strict
confidence and
patched up and
kept dark, as he
thought, has won-
dered why on earth he could never get another
start. This may enlighten him.

Good old Chancellor Brownless, of Melb.
University, has decided that the best way of cele-
brating the “ Diamond Jubilee ” is not to illu-
minate the streets, but to present H.M. with an
illuminated address —which would no doubt inter-
est her deeply if it ever chanced to meet her royal
eye. Dr. Brownless forgets that alighted street
illuminates the addresses of all the local inhabi-
tants.

Judge Gibson, a potentate of N.S.W. Dis-
trict Court, appears to have put up a new prece-
dent lately, at Bingara. A prisoner was charged
with the theft of a tin of baking-powder, and the
jury brought him in guilty. Then the Judge
descended on him as follows (local paper report) :
Prisoner was sentenced to three years’ penal servitude ;
and, in passing sentence, his Honor remarked that he was
determined to deal with him as severely as possible, as he
(prisoner) had not allowed the magistrates in the lower
court to deal with his case, but had put the count ry to
the expense of £l9 9s. to bring the trial before him.
The Bulletin refrains from commenting on this
apparently monstrous judgment until it ascertains
whether the statements above quoted are based on
fact, or whether the whole story arises out of a
reporter’s nightmare.

The Adelaide Hospital row has sent 16
Adelaide medical students (including five ladies)
to Melb. Univ., and two to Sydney.
In the “old” days, jury-
men, on retiring to consider their
verdicts, were not allowed any
refreshments. On one occasion,
after a jury had been shut up
for some hours, the Sheriff came
to the presiding Judge, who
was very fond of his glass, and
told him the jury wanted some
water. “ Can I give it to them,
your Honor, since I have sworn
to give them neither meat nor
drink?” His Honor considered
a minute or two: “Well, yes,
you may give them some water ;
it certainly isn’t meat—and I
shouldn’t call it drink.”

The first thing that strikes
a visitor to St. Kilda(Vic.)beach
is a huge signboard about
100yds. long, which obscures the
whole foreshore and allows only
a patch of sand and a seagull as
evidence of the landscape be-
hind. In foot-long letters the pub-
lic is warned that “ these baths
were patronised byLadyHotham,
Sir Henry Barkly’s family, Sir
Charles Darling’s family, Sir
Charles Manners-Sutton’s fami-
ly, Sir George Bowen’s family, the
Marchioness of Normanby, Sir
Henry Loch’s family, the Coun-
tess of Hopetoun, and Lady Bras-
sey.” This is too bad. Never a
mention of Premier Turner’s
pup, presented by Mrs. Freeman
Thomas. And in his own con-
stituency, too!
Those who ought to know all about it say

Oard. Moran. It was the first and last time the
boys could tickle his Eminence under the
friendly shelter of the ballot-box. There is many
an old spore to settle. Archbishop Vaughan
treated his priests as men and gentlemen, and that
squabble about his remains is not easily got over
Dr Barry s “ removal ” from St. John’s has also
got much to do with it.
When the Cardinal came to Sydney there were
several Deans and other dignitaries in positions
since given to young men of the raw school, who
mostly seem to have friends at Court. It used to

Victorian law has formally decided tt
hang Quinn, the survivor of the attempted double
suicide at Albert Park. In all probability, how-
ever, it won’t hang him, but will let him off with
a long term of imprisonment; but either way his
fate should be a serious warning to all people who
resolve to die together. No man is a good enough
shot to feel quite sure that he can kill both him-
self and his wife even at short range, and when
two people who love each other decide to make a
romantic joint ending neither likes to batter the
other with a chair-leg after the shooting to make
quite sure that life is extincL Even if the man,
who generally supervises the'*suicide, makes quite
sure the woman is dead, he very seldom manages
to kill himself effectually, for he can’t batter him-
self fatally with a chair-leg ; Quinn, for example,
only blew one eye out and got into gaol. The
only sure device that this paper can think of is
for the romantic pair to chain and padlock them-
selves together and step overboard with lewt. of
ballast attached to them. If the water is deep
enough, and the chain doesn’t slip, and the pad-
lock holds, that is sure enough fo r all practical
purposes.

An interesting duel is being fought out
just now in Brisbane re the leprosy question. The
parents of children attending a city school object
to the sister of a leprous boy now in the lazarette
being allowed to attend above-mentioned school.
The authorities, backed by medical opinion, say
there is no danger of contagion, and refuse, con-
sequently, to exclude the girl. The average parent,
however, who has noticed the leprous plague
spread in the wake of the imported Chow, doesn’t
care a rap for medical dicta, and says he will not
allow his child to attend the same school as the
relatives of lepers —and therefore a boycott on the
school is impending. And, really, it’s difficult to
avoid sympathising with the parent —and still
more with the unlucky girl ostracised for the un-
cleanness of her brother.

West nil ia, returned to Melb.
recently and was holding
forth on his adventures to
his old congregation. There
was a crowded house, mostly
female, and every little wit-
ticism was sustained with a
trickle of giggles. “My
friends,’’concluded the shep-
herd, “ I shall never forget
the sound advice given me
by our loved Bishop Goe
when I departed to the Wes-
tern land. He told me that
as far as possible I should
always conform to. the cus-
toms of the people among
whom I dwelt. And, friends,
many comforts did 1 derive
by following that advice (ap-
plause). Though, I daresay,
some of my congregation—
the ladies especially—(here
a little giggle) would have
been rather alarmed had
they seen me, for, friends,
I did as others did (laugh),
and took with me every-
where my black gin (cough),
my black gin (cough and
sensation in the congrega-
tion), my black gin -(sup-

which to allay my thirst.”

“ Love is all very well in the sparsely-
populated rural districts.”—New Woman.
Jack Gulliver, the Pigmy King of ‘ ‘ Matsa, ”
is a native of Bendigo, Vic., and is 21 years old.
Out of a family of six children, Jack and one sister
are the only midgets; Jack stands 3ft. 7in. and
weighs four stone ; his sister, aged 12, is only as
high as his shoulder. The other children, like the
parents, are well set up; Jack’s 16-year-old
brother stands six feet; his father, an engineer,
weighs lljst. ; his mother weighs 14st. Jack
says : “ First let me tell you that J. C. Williamson
did not pick me up in a woful condition ; damn
it! that’s a reflection on my mother, and, although
I’m a stray goose at home, I feel that a boy’s best
friend is his mother. I’m a perfectly developed
man, though small, as you can see; I’m as active
as a cricket, and can carry twice my own weight—
I can carry Gus. Gregory across the stage. I’ve
ridden a bicycle for 14 years, and I can guide her
over a threepenny-bit full butt every time. Sydney
streets are bad, I find; my wheel twizzled right
round with me on a greasy patch yesterday. I’ve
been on the stage, off and on, 12 years, singing
comic songs, chiefly in Melb., Geelong, Ballarat,
Bendigo and Adelaide. I have always taught
myself my business—J.C.W. was the first to give
me instruction. I never spoke lines till I played
in ‘ Matsa ’. I notice the Herald says I’m vulgar;
that’s because on the stage I hug the girls round
the legs, I suppose ; give the Herald my inches
and I’d like to see the Herald more decorous.
On the stage I look very tall, but behind the
scenes the girls play catches with me. There’s a
lot of jealousy in the show business ; but what is
the good of one being jealous of the other ;
it can make the other’s encores no better
nor worse. I’m not frightened of anything
on the stage ; once I learn a thing you
can’t thump it out of me. I’m a big fisherman —
Goody and I intend to clear the harbour out.”
(If Jack gets a large schnapper on, the fish might
pull him overboard and eat him.) “Do you
observe how Goody’s theatre connection worries
him ; look how bald he is on top. I can play a
violin, accordeon, mandolin, concertina, tin-whistle
in more or less degree. I’ve a craze for collecting
curios—people call me a bit ratty. I’ve 1600 Vic.
stamps and 1000 foreign stamps; I’ve a, big box full
of stones, curious shaped tins, wee little sample
tins. Mother has threatened to tip the whole lot
into the dust-box —I say ! you had better not say
she is 14st. —never mind, though, it only shows
that it is not her fault that I’m 4st. I’ve refused
3s. 6d. for my collection of curios.”

One of the quarantined passengers per
Nineveh explains how beautifully they manage
things in Melbourne, First he was allowed to
leave the vessel, whereupon he took himself and
his luggage and his alleged germs to a coffee
palace, and shed infection on 90 other lodgers.
Then he was re-captured, but the 90 other lodgers
whom he had germed were left at large. He was
removed in a cab, and presumably infected that
also, and then the contaminated vehicle was turned
loose. Then he was vaccinated and shoved into
another cab, and when he was done with it that
cab was also sent adrift to bestow infection on
other customers. He was next taken on board
the Nineveh, where he was required to sleep in
the ship’s bedding, not yet cleaned and fumigated,
and the nurse who attended the smallpox patients
sat next him at meals. Having gathered all the
germs he could off the nurse he was shifted to the
quarantine station, and when he had been there
two days—so that the germs he brought from the
Nineveh might get well into his bedding—he was
fumigated and disinfected. Then he slept a night
in the same bedding, so as to get a fresh supply of
germs. Next day the bedding was disinfected,
and then he slept in it some more, and shed upon
it the germs he had gathered off it the previous
night after he was disinfected himself. Under
which circumstances his opinions about the Melb.
quarantine arrangements are unfit for full publi-
cation.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 9,1897.
Mt Dear Mtee—
Some strict olerios were shocked at the Mayoress,
Mrs. Ives, holding a reception on Ash Wednes-
day, but the godless majority present at the Town
Hall didn’t even know that that church-festival or
fast was proceeding, and ate passion-fruit, ices,
and other delicacies unwhipped of conscience.
The ante-room was adorned with the competition
statuary groups for the new markets, and the hall
itself wassplendidly decorated with exotic forestry,
and his Worship, in full and flowing official robes,
the Mayoress, and her married daughter shook
hands unweariedly with a thousand citizenesses,
who sat down hard on the nearest chairs with a
firm grasp of their parasols and a serious stare.
Among the distinguished visitors was a globe-
trotting newspaper-man, whose beard has been
whitened with 55 years of journalism, but the
editorial eye is mild and fatherly, befitting a
record of only two libels in a half-century, which
is his proud boast. Most of the local Nicest being
still out of town, the reception-audience, on the
whole, was suburban, and the gowning to match.
The Cardinal is doing well by the forthcoming
Australian Fair in presenting a 500-guinea
diamond necklace to be competed for by the
covetous faithful at a guinea raffle. The donor
guarantees the jeweller the value of the trinket,
which is raffled at a profit, the money over and
above the market-price going to the good of the
“cause.” If the full sum be not subscribed the
scheme falls through. Most jumbo presentations
to church cake-and-cushion scrambles are worked
in the same way. Prominent firms have re-
sponded generously to appeals from committees
for gifts, which is large-minded of them, as these
monster fairs are bad for local trade.
The crowd at Randwick at the March meeting
on Saturday was like the Spanish fleet in the play
—you couldn’t see it because it was not in sight.
Scattered spectators dotted the empty spaces of
the grand-stand, and the few women with con-
spicuous gowns had really a chance to show them
off, had there been anybody there to see them.
An “ off ” meeting like last week’s is not, as a rule,
illuminating in the way of dress innovations, but
two or three wearers of fashionable attire took a
last opportunity of displaying their summer fur-
belows. A mossy green silk, with a satisfactory
Bkirt hanging from a waist which could have worn
a man’s collar as a belt, was topped, off with
shoulder-elaborations of brocade and a vast and
velvet hat. A bride, formerly one of the belles
among Melb.’s Chosen, now settled here, aired
one of her many wedding-outfit frocks fashionably
corrugated with frills. A well-known dressy
woman successfully mixed red and purply-black.
The Wheelman’s Carnival, which began last
Thursday on the Cricket Ground, was attended
by thousands, who found an absorbing interest in
seeing the blue-clad Lesna circling round and
round, hanging on like a bull-dog to the hind-
wheel of his pacers. Among many women now
the bike is quite supplanting the gee-gee as a
draw, and instead of talking of “starting price”
or “odds on,” they earnestly discuss the merits of
“sprinters” and “stayers,” and “quints” or
“quads,” and “racing behind pace,” and much
other mysterious slang of the jigger and its ad-
herents. Frenchman-like, the hero of the day
showed how to be artistic, though athletic, and
had his pacing teams and machines all in cerulean
hue, to match his own neat racing rig, his sweater
finished off with a black band. In the 20-inile
race he looked aggravatingly cool among his over-
heated competitors and pacers, and his legs
worked with the regular,' monotonous beat of a
pair of piston-rods. The foreign apparel showed
up the local colors as shabby and frowsy, except
the glittering Bill Martin, who shone in yellow.
Among onlookers theatrical folk largely de-
corated the grand-stand, varied with numerous
priests. On the whole, it was by no means a
“ smart ” crowd. A popular music-hall singer
had a pretty blouse-skirt with black cross-bars,
and her newly-wedded husband hung about de-
votedly, as though he, too, were racing behind
pace.
“ Miss Brown ” was visited on election-night
by the Maoriland Premier and party, who, after
a few days in Sydney, left by Saturday’s Welling-
ton boat. The Seddon family on its travels
has been taking things as they come, as every-
day citizens do, with a refreshing absence of the
pompous Premier - on - tour element. The hon.
Richard himself (despite the sneers of the S.M.
Herald) is a good example of the practical
Premier —“ the burly, hard-headed, heavy-fisted
man who fights his way to the front.” Mrs.
Seddon is a comfortable matron with a shrewd,
motherly face and a strong belief in the value of
female suffrage. Miss Seddon is like her father,
and has a local reputation for good looks.
At the latest Nice wedding at Moss Vale, where
Miss Laura Osborne was married to Police-In-
spector-General Fosbery’s nephew, there was a
most elaborate bridal-cake with the orthodox
cupids and orange-blossom in sugar-icing. This
glittering confection was entirely made by the
bride’s family, and besides being glacially beauti-
ful to behold, was cake right through. Much
shop-made wedding show-bread is a hollow fraud,
consisting of six inches of sweetened plaster to
two inches of alleged plum-duff.
“ Little Gulliver,” the dwarf attraction of
“Matsa,” was on the Manly boat one day last
week, dressed in tall silk hat and miniature
“street-sweeper” frock coat, and proved a sensa-
tion to troops of small boys, who whooped three
cheers for him as the ferry left Manly pier. On
Gulliver’s first appearance at rehearsal with the
“Matsa” Co., Millie Young chucked him under
the chin with “ Hullo, little boy.” “ Hullo your-
self,” growled the dwarf in that rumbling growl
which his audience finds so comical, and Millie
gave a surprised start at the deep basso proceeding
from such a tiny body. Before J.C.W. engaged
him he used to appear at Melb. Temperance Hall
sing-song—salary ten shillings a week, “ when he
got it. ”
As the Beggar Student, H. Bracy, though not
looking as young as he did when he was younger,
still gives the same lightsome skin, ami ---.rs
some trim floral-patterned coats, and silver round
his pretty little footwear. The chorus girls also
wear some fur, to give them a Polish air, and they
sing brightly, but I am afraid the public is not too
sweet just now on comio opera in costume —what
audiences like to see are the latest modes on the
soprano and the newest naughtiness in the plot.
In “The Beggar Student ” the blue is in the cos-
tumes, and not in the situations. Nina Osborne
sports azure tights as the cornet, as do her fellow-
officers ; Mabelle Darley’s first frock is blue and
tinselly, but for her wedding the heroine dons a
badly-cut white satin, and has her hair hung in
curls over her face in the old, old stage-terrier
style. A light soprano with tresses au naturel
would fill a long-felt want on the boards.
Australian sassiety federated years ago—an
event in Nice circles thrills the “ toney ” from
Townsville to Tas. Witness the latest important
wedding in Slowbart. The guests hailed from
many centres, and the function was gushed over
in the social columns of five provinces. The
bridegroom had a line in the word-painting —an
innovation which will spread—“he looked very
handsome in his smart get-up.” In this case, the
admiration of the pen-woman had cause in the
subject’s pose as an Adonis, before he was regene-
rated by a tailor-made evangelist and veiled his
manly beauty with a beard.
At another fashionable hitching-up the bride-
groom’s attire was chronicled even to his yellow
buttonhole-flower —a marigold. The floral lan-
guage spoke truly then, as the bride was richly
gilt.
An Australian woman has been booming as a
palmist in London, and adroitly acquired money
at a trade which is tabooed by the police as coming
under “the vag.” Palmistry, as well as other
hanky-panky, has been taken up seriously by many
Sydney and Melb. women since hard times began ;
working cleverly a former society connection, they
have accumulated cash enough to retire comfort-
ably from the scene of their trickery. You can
hardly call it swindling, because they make no
pretence. Other women simply come to them and
clamor to be gulled. Hand-reading up-to-date
ought to have a sure income in it for a nice, smart
woman. The “science” as now worked creaks
with age ; it is all expressed in terms of the middle
ages by the exponent, who invariably tells her sub-
ject to expect a letter, or that a water-journey is
before her, or that she will have a visit from a
dark man with news—all survivals from the times
when a letter or a five-mile trip from one’s home,
or the advent of an unknown in the sleepy little
town were epoch-making events —when there were
no newspapers, nor railways, nor penny-post.
There isn’t any use for an occult science ignoring
telephones, motor-cars, and snap-shot cameras.
The newest idea in connection with titles is the
demand already made for the creation of she-
knights, the order to be composed of women
authors, artists, and philanthropists, to celebrate
the great and glorious record-reign of H.M. There
is no feminine of knight, and they would all have
to be dubbed “ lady,” which unoriginal handle
they must share with every titled woman under
the rank of a duchess, whether she be the wife of
the Marquis of Granby or of M. H. Davies. How
would “Lady ” Corelli and “ Lady ” Edna Lyall
agree among literary knightesses ? These suffixes
wouldn’t carry over to husbands, probably, and
the owner of a “lady” on her own would feel
crushed out of sight as plain “Mr.” American
women, who are rabid about titles, are ’cute
enough to annex them in the good, old-fashioned
way. Amelie Rives, authoress of some frank and
candid erotic literature, went one better than even
Miss Vanderbilt by, a short time ago, shaking off
her first matrimonial shackles and appropriating
a real live Prince, and now advertises her books
as by “Princess Troubetskoi.”
After the diamond - jubilee celebrations there
will probably be a resuscitation of that boom-
excrescence, “ The Colonial Peerage, Baronetage,
and Landed Gentry,” to record the new titles.
The first edition was a crimson morocco gilt-
edged vulgarity, wherein the newly - enriched
Nicest were paged, with all their ancestry and
belongings, under such headings as “Blank of
Weroona,” with a furbished-up title usually de-
rived from Oireland’s tattered aristocracy, Blank
himself being a K.C.M.G. and the name-estate a
suburban villa of ten rooms and a lean-to.
To celebrate the “ record reign ” an enterprising
London medallist is sending out picture-cata-
logues of designs for metal memorial-tokens under
Her Gracious’ patronage. Australia is expected
to invest largely in gilt tin-tags which are drawn
life-size. Loyal citizens will go about labelled
“ Britons, Rejoice ! ” or with a couple of inches of
God-save embossed on brass and hung on their
chests. “An enamelled gilt badge with an appro-
priate motto ” ought to keep loyal feelings stirring
and serve to console disappointed title-hunters.
If everybody can’t be knighted, it’s quite within
the power of each to decorate himself cheaply with
a glittering disc of loyalty, with a metal suspender
to hang it on by thrown in.
A Potts Point resident sent out invitations for
an evening party recently, sensibly remarking on
the left hand bottom comer “No music.” This
seems to hold out promise of a time when an ear-
tortured population can go out for an evening’s
pleasuring with the sweet assurance of resting
from Chopin and all his waltzes and being oblivious
of “ The Holy City ” for evermore. There is too
much music in the world, and far too much
“Jerusalem” in music; the young woman who
stands up to the suburban piano and bids her
mournful victims “ Hark how the Angels Sing ”
in shrill soprano ought to be written down by in-
furiated letter - writers to the papers with the
theatre-hat wearer, and street-hawker, and other
nuisances.
A Nice family, during a recent trip ’Ome,
achieved glory by purchasing for the just-out-
daughter a satin ball-gown, the exact replica, shoes
and all, of the wedding apparel of May of Teck,
with which resemblance—as far as a slender anti-
podean can resemble that exceedingly dull, heavy,
commonplace young woman of Dutch build—the
proud possessor of the frock, who is unfortunately
at present in bad health, intends to paralyse
Sydney sassiety next season.
Flags at Sydney Cricket Ground, last Thursday,
were flying at half-mast to notify the decease ot
Mrs. Stephen, wife of Mr. Justice Stephen, who
died at Moss Vale last week, and was buried at
Rand wick on Saturday afternoon.
The Ormuz, on Saturday, took away Mr. Carl
Fischer and his daughter, Mrs. Inskip, who were
bon-voyaged by many friends and handed up the
usual farewell vegetable trophies.
Fellow-passengers of a recently returned theatri-
cal press-woman tell a smart repartee made by her
as she and some other first-saloonists were watch-
ing a couple of steerage passengers who, on near-
ing Adelaide, their destination, blossomed forth
into swagger suits of latest cut. “Why, they
look quite respectable ,” pronounced some high-
toned maidens, disappointed at only finding out
the youths’ attractions at the end of the voyage.
“ No doubt,” said their mother oracularly,
“ poverty and respectability often go together—
don’t they, Miss Blank? ” “I don’t know,” said
the actress ; “I have never tried either.”
Moonlight nights in Centennial Park are dan-
gerous to pedestrians by reason of the numerous
foolish virgins who take no oil in their lamps, but
rush round on their jiggers in the dark and try
the nerve of beginners on the wheel by whizzing
past them violently in all directions. The number
of bikers—other than the Nicest—who go to the
Park for their Sunday spin is increasing weekly.
“The Federal Banner of United Australia” is
the wordy title of a patriotic outburst by S. Pegum.
The sentiment of the song is all right, but the
metre is a trifle labored.
“ From out the void they led a blooming world”
sounds slangy. “ Australia Fair,” by “ Amicus,”
has advanced into a fifth edition, ’neath a blue
star-spangled cover ; this was played as a march
by the band at the military send-off, week before
last. S. Hoben has published his setting of
“ Melons,” sung at the Palace by Lottie Moore, a
successful attempt to catch the tuneful character
of the melody of the nigger-race, from which, ac-
cording to a Hungarian musical expert with an
unspellable name, the music of the future is to
spring. Paling publishes the three.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“Commander Collins, the dapper little Secre-
tary of Vic. Defence Department, hoped that he
was going to England as Premier Turner’s secre-
tary. He is an authority on official etiquette, and
has the mysterious £ Queen’s regulations ’ at his
fingers’ ends —he could tell the Premier when to
walk on his knees, when to lick the Queen’s shoes,
when to stand on his head, and other highly import-
ant things. But Turner said—No ; he would only
take with him Police-sergeant Lloyd, who acts as
Premier’s orderly. Accordingly, Lloyd goes, and
Collins remains.
“When private-secretary Wallington was
shunted from Melb. Guvmentouse, the official
explanation was that Gov. Brassey had imported
his wife’s brother, and wanted the young man to
have a place on his staff. The ‘ explanation ’ was
mere fudge, the real reason, as here explained at
the time, being that Wallington could not get on
with H.E. and the pushful young bucks he had
brought out with him. Mr. Capell has never
acted on said staff, and now he has gone back
’Ome again.
“ One of the handsomest girls seen in Collins-
street for some time now is the divinely tall and
fair daughter of a Sydney hotel-keeper, who, it is
said, never has served nectar to the god.i? Which,
says dudedom, is downright cruelty to the gods.
“ At their last concert, the Melb. Liedertafel
chorus, balder and more comfortable-looking than
ever, sang sentimentally of withered roses, and
such like, winding up with ‘ Robin Adair,’ in a
manner surprisingly arch and coy for singers of
substantial build and the wrong sex. Their choice
of a song suggests Scotch influence somewhere. Is
there a solemn-faced, 6ft., 14st. Caledonian on
earth whose happiest moments are not spent at the
piano, dirging with still small voice but vast ex-
pression such doleful ditties as ‘Ye Banks and
Braes ’.
“ It was at the same concert that a new lady
pianist elbowed Chopin fireworks at the audience
from behind the shelter of a huge flowered sash,
while Maggie Stirling, effective as usual in her
golden gown, led on little Bertie Zelman by the
hand to acknowledge their joint encore with quite
a motherly air.
“ The prevalent concert coiffure set one think-
ing of days when the suspicion of a parting on a
feminine scalp was equivalent to a confession of
frumpdom. Nowadays, damsels not naturally
gifted with the orthodox thin white line plant a
comb of paste brilliants among their too-luxuriant
locks and pretend that the desired ‘divide’ is
hidden by the ornament. Another change is the
popularity of natural roses for innocent nestling in
the back hair. Upstanding aigrettes and ospreys
look bold and jaunty by contrast.
“ The widow of a well-known Victorian who
committed suicide after slaughtering his children
and locating some ineffectual bullets in his wife’s
skull, is soon to be married again. Timid people
wonder at her pluck. After such an experience
as hers, they say, the average woman would run
the risks of a sleeping volcano, rather than those
of the most trusted hubby that ever was.
“Apropos of widows: visitors to a certain fashion-
able resort are deeply interested in the intentions
of the handsome relict of a great shipping-magnate
with regard to a love-lorn youth not so very
much older than her own urchins. All the holi-
days Romeo has shadowed the Siren and her
olive-branches, carried cockles, sorted sea-weeds,
and looked so despairing whenever another male
approached the group, that old lady onlookers
weep tears of pity for the poor Innocent and find
nothing hard enough to say of his Charmer.
“ Mixed bathing, of a sort, is generally tolerated
nowadays, though local splash-parties are neither
pretty, Frenchy, nor fashionable. Fat women
from the backblocks, clad in dripping, clinging
night-gowns or short flannel skirts, fight shy of
the water without ‘ pa’s ’ protection. The latter
sheds his upper raiment and dons his oldest nether
garments while the brats paddle round in ‘ buff,’
and ma squats on all-fours in a few inches of
water and lets the ’longshore ripples gently
moisten her shivering bulk. Mrs. Grundy endures
these Yahoo exhibitions without wincing, but
what a shriek she raises when a bevy of smart
girls with taut and trim escorts in up-to-date
swimming-suits take the briny together anywhere
within cooey of civilisation !
“In one of the Sunbeam booklets, the authoress
(the former Lady Brassey) congratulates herself
and readers on the fact that at the Pompeii ex-
cavations the pernicious custom of ‘ tipping ’ has
been disallowed. His Ex. of Victoria apparently
has the knack of inculcating his womankind with
the principles of economy. Govt. House resident
guests, for instance, are all related to their hosts,
so that the cakes and ale are kept in the family,
and at the same time a suitable semblance of vice-
regal hospitality is maintained.
“ A wealthy and childless Melb. art patron has
a nude picture of his own dead daughter hanging
behind a curtain in a cabinet by his bedside. The
picture was painted by a famous Parisian artist
when the young lady was under 20, and is a perfect
piece of flesh painting. The girl is represented
standing tip-toe on the edge of a glove, with a
gleaming star on her head—symbolical of some-
thing or other. There is no muslin about it; just
a girl without reservation.
“ The women doctors of Melbourne are working
hard for the establishment of a Women’s Hospital
at which all the Sawboneses and Boluses are to be
feminine. The Stow group of lady doctors is at
the bottom of the scheme, which is making head-
way, as the promoters are pushing, energetic and
clever.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
W. J. Lyne, the N.S.W. Protectionist
leader, formally declares himself a convert to
woman suffrage.
Two things were remembered against
Wrixon in connection with the Convention Elec-
tion. First, that he was responsible for the pro-
vision of flogging in the Victorian Criminal Code:
Second, that he introduced and got carried a bill
to prevent the publication of Sunday newspapers
in the province.
Melb. Age has been interesting reading
lately. The “ watchman on the tower ” leader
immediately before the elections had perhaps most
to do with the crushing nature of the inevitable
Liberal victory. And how’s this for the “ curiosi-
ties of journalism ” ? It appeared on the day after
the elections : “Through town and country alike,
almost universally, the angel of political death
spread his wings on the blast, and breathed on the
faces of those luckless Tories as he passed.”
Dear Bulletin, —Now that N.S. Wales
has cheered itself hoarse over the success
of the ten “best” men, let us examine
the results for a moment. In the first
place, I would like to ask what is Mr. J.
P. Abbott’s programme, seeing that he obtained
64,000 votes ? During the past few weeks I read
the daily papers very carefully, and do not remem-
ber having seen his manifesto ; neither did he ad-
dress any public meeting. Mr. Millen, on the
other hand, put forward a very sensible plat-
form, and seemed to me one of the few can-
didates who thoroughly grasped the Fede-
ral question. Yet he polled only 10,000 votes.
Why this difference? Possibly the well-known
Democratic views of the former secured
for him his high position. And, by the
way, how the Democracy of N.S.W. asserted
itself ! M'Millan, 84,000 ; Abbott, 64,000; Bruce
Smith, 41,000, and the candidates with Democratic
tendencies nowhere. Then, again, the able and
democratic Ashton, one of the best debaters in
the House, 20,000. Brunker, 76,000 ! Let us pray !
—Sancho Panza.
Some Convention returns up to time of
going to press. New South Wales ten: Barton,
Premier Reid, Carruthers, M'Millan, Lyne,
Brunker, R. E. O’Connor, Speaker Abbott, J. T.
Walker, B. R. Wise. Returns not all in, but the
gap between Wise, the last of the accepted, and
John See, the first of the rejected, is so great that
no alteration is possible. Victorian ten : Premier
Turner, Quick, Deakin, Peacock, Isaacs, Tren-
with, Berry, Fraser, Zeal and Higgins. Sun-
dry returns are yet to arrive, and the
Tory party still hopes against hope that
the eleventh man, Wrixon, may displace
Higgins. Meanwhile, however, Wrixon’s general
tendency is to fall further behind, and the pros-
pect of closing the gap of 900 votes which separates
him from Higgins seems hopeless. S.A.’s ten
(probably) : Premier Kingston, Holder, Cock-
burn, Gordon, Baker, Symon, Downer, Glynn,
Howe, Solomon. Many returns were still to come
in, however, and the position of the last four is
very shaky.
A sidelight on the N.S.W. Convention
election:—
Many of the Convention votes polled by R. W. Reid
were no doubt intended for Premier Reid, for, broadly
speaking, no one had ever heard of R. W. Reid. Simi-
larly Dan. O’Connor deprived R. E. O’Connor, Q.C., of
many votes. The latter, of course, also lost much R.O.
support through his inclusion, without his consent, in the
Protestant bunch, for while no doubt Orange Protestants
refrained from voting for him, a R.C. priestly organ
cold-bloodedly told its readers not to vote for anyone
whose name appeared on the Protestant or Orange ticket.
Which, under the circs., was a most cowardly and dis-
graceful piece of advice, inasmuch as it contained the in-
sinuation that the straight-going “Dick” O’Connor was
playing a foul and double game and was a consenting
party to his inclusion in the “ Protestant bunch.” But
for the intrusion of the sectarian issue, R. E. O’Connor
would probably have been second or third on the poll. It
will be seen from the foregoing that no more adroit
scheme for “ queering ” his chances could possibly
have been devised than that of the parsons who, by pro-
fessing to give him a support which they, of course, knew
would not be seriously extended, heavily damaged him in
the eyes of many of the most influential of his co-reli-
gionists. This time, it is clear, the arts of Machiavelli
were at the service, not of the Cardinal, but of his sec-
tarian opponents. As witness the foregoing facts relating
to the candidature of R. E. O’Connor, and the circum-
stance that Cardinal Moran, instead of contenting himself
with looming large and all-powerful in the distant gloom,
was so stupid and unworldly as to come down and let
himself be weighed and measured and put, as it were,
into a paper bag like a pound or two of onions.

wilderness of white waist-

that the “genial He-

sembly one evening with
■a black, instead of a
white, covering to his
■digestion. In the ordin-
ary course of senatorial
funny business the Govt,
whip went round with a
purse, collecting small
silver for a new-vest testi-
monial. When 13s. had
been raised the ’Ouse bore
cff its Zox to the refresh-
ment-room, where his
public andprivate virtues
were solemnly rceorded
prior to the presentation
of the ’Ouse’s small token
of esteem. Zox, in re-
sponding, invited his
admirers to join him in
a glass of wine, and they
did so unanimously. An
hour or two later, on his
way home, he opened the
purse and realised the
awful truth that he was
67 shillings out on the
transaction =■— <£4 worth
of drinks, less 13s. The
weakness of the narrative
lies in the supposition
that a Hebrew could
possibly fail to guess the
contents of a purse from
itsweight-cMw-bulk, after
handling it fora moment.
Moreover, if Zox couldn’t
sniff a practical joke
what would be the good
of his nose ?
“Amongst the arrivals by the Arcadia,”
says S.M. Herald, “ were Mr. J. C. Hilton, one
of Her Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the
county of Montgomery (Wales), and High Sheriff
in 1893-4, accompanied by Mr. Stephen Brown,
Dumfriesshire. Mr. Hilton expresses himself as
highly pleased with Australia a/ far as he has seen
it, and thinks it in advance of the mother country
in many respects, notably in the magnificence of
its public buildings, banks, &c., and the excellence
of its tram ami railway services.” Thanks. The
question now is—have Mr. Hilton, .Taypee, and
Mr. Brown yet been accorded the “ well-deserved
distinction ” of honorary membership of Sydney
Union Club?
H. H. * Champion is of noble
lineage, and has even relatives who
live at Toorak. The Social Democrat
sometimes pours himself into a frock-
coat, claps a shiny stove-pipe hat on
his head, and visits them. It is
mainly because he is occasionally seen
in that top-hat and frock-coat, and
because he says “ heah, heah ” at
meetings, and plays the English gen-
tleman, thatH.H. makes no headway
with the Melbourne workman. It is
true that John Hancock also wears a
frock-coat sometimes, but that only
makes him look more Hancooky than
ever, whereas Champion looks like
an emperor at the very least.
“Demos” Palmer is the sole
survivor in Melb. of the genus con-
verted pressman. Once upon a time
there was another specimen, an ex-
member of the staff of a godly daily,
long defunct, who, after being fired
out of his billet for being audibly
blasphemous at a Presbyterian As-
sembly meeting, donned a red jersey
and became a full-blooded Salva-
tionist. No major was there who
yelled “Hallelujah!” more vocifer-
ously or stoushed the tambourine with
greater vigor, and one night, when a
brother scribe happened across him
at a meeting he was “doing,” his
eyes filled with tears at the earnest-
ness of the regenerated one. Sud-
denly the latter caught sight of the
unreformed pressman at his little
table in front of the platform, and
smiled to him one of those sickly
smiles peculiar to the saved. Then
he lifted a slip of paper carefully
from his pocket and, scrawling a few
words, folded it and dropped it
silently below. The reporter, fully
expecting to receive some pious in-
junctions to mend his ways, opened
the missive in trepidation and read :
“ Full up of this blanky rot; is there
any show of getting a billet on the
press again ? ”
“ Salmon ” Wilson paid just £30,000
solid cash for his title on a plain business basis.
His family insisted on the “old man” getting a
title, as they had matrimonial ambitions. “Sal-
mon,” like a level-headed man, went to the proper
quarter, told the circumstances, and asked the
price. “A monumental gift,” was the answer;
“build a big examination hall for Melbourne
University, and the title is yours. “Right.
How much?” “£30,000!” “Very well.” The
cheque was handed over, and that big white
atrocity, Wilson Hall, exists. That hall has so
overshadowed Wilson that his sterling acclimatisa-
tion work is lost in a fog.

The deceased Ash, M.P., Premier King-
ston’s law partner, joined the 'Cape Mounted
Rifles nearly 20 years ago, so that he might act as
correspondent at the front in the Kaffir war. He
was a man (writes The Bulletin’s Adelaide
correspondent) of dauntless courage and iron
resolution, and although nearly always in an
insignificant Parliamentary minority, sometimes
standing alone, never yielded an inch to his
opponents. During seven years of political life,
no one can point to a single private promise or
hustings pledge which he broke. He was an
“ Individualist ” of the deepest dye, and he never
flinched from uttering his views, no matter how
unpopular they might be with his audience.
J. B. Mather, who was in partnership with Ash
as a newspap- r proprietor for nine years, and who
shared his libel-verdict misfortunes, says—“ He
was the cleverest, the most honorable, and the
kindest-hearted man I ever knew.”

A cable in Sydney E. News states that
“ Mr. Frank Bennett (one of the News pro-
prietors) arrived by the Austral. He was in Paris
during the Czar’s visit.” What the News means
obviously is that the Czar was in Paris during
Mr. Frank Bennett’s visit.
Two old Vic. legal identities died last week.
One George Barber, solicitor, who had practised
at Warrnambool for 43 years. He arrived in
Melbourne in ’4l, and was 83 when he died. The
other, O. L. Hanbury, was admitted in 1840, and
had practised in Victoria since ’52.
One of the late George Ash’s peculiarities
was that he christened all five of his children with
names beginning with vowels. He said he had
been so teased when a youngster and afterwards
by being called “ Gash ” and Hash that he wished
to save his family from a similar fate.
The son of an Australian Jewish Rabbi
has renounced the faith of his fathers, and turned
Presbyterian, of all things, whereat there is great
rejoicing amongst the “unco gude.” After all,
the conversion is not very surprising. The Jew
who turned at all would naturally turn Scotchman.
James Tyson, who goes to England with
Nelson, is, as a type, the most notable of the Aus-
tralians who will salute the record reign. A native
of N.S.W., 6ft. 4in. high, 74 years of age, straight,
hale, cheerful; never smoked, never swore, never
drank, never fell in love, and several times a
millionaire.
An effort is being made by curator Maiden,
of Sydney Botanical Gardens, to have the
neglected grave of Allan Cunningham in the
“Old Sandhills,” Belmore-road, put into repair.
While about it, some attention might be paid to
the grave of John Oxley, the explorer, near
Cunningham’s.
Less than two hours before his death, Ash,
M.P. (S.A.) insisted upon giving Premier King-
ston, his law partner, particulars and directions
concerning a case he was work.. .g up when he
was taken ill. Ash leaves a widow and five
children very poorly provided for, and a fund for
their benefit has been started.
Q. ex-warden and Mines-Minister Hodg-
kinson is spelling in Sydney after three years spent
in reporting on Westralian mines. His old Q.

looks as rosy and as gritty as ever, though he has
recently been known to prefer shandygaff to
whisky. Billy Little will grieve over this sign of
advancing years.
Two Yic. women are getting ready for a
plunge into the legal profession. One is the
daughter of an M.L.C., and the other is a B.A.
There appears to be nothing expressly against
them in English law, but the implied presumption
is pretty steep, and they will need, no doubt, a
statute to give them a leg over it. Maoriland
already has taken down the barriers.
£. £. Smith figured as whipper-in of the
29 Victorian candidates for Convention votes,
although he was one of the very few—if not the
only one—who shouted cabs for the convenience of
his/lamentable disciples. By this time .£..£. has
probably arrived at a dim suspicion that he is
politically deader than the smellful herring.
Socially he is still a mere youth of 67.
A certain lengthy Maoriland politician,
some time ago harassed by a dissatisfied lady
friend, ascribed her unsuccessful attempts to bring
him into disrepute to the feminine love of posing
before the public in any capacity. Lately this
lady was delivered of triplets, and the news was
broken to the politician by a friend. “ Good
Lord ! ” said the long man, excitedly waving his
hands, “ where the Devil will the woman’s
craze for notoriety land her NEXT ? ”
Andrew Lang has the distinction of beina
uncle of a young Australian lady who is regardeo
as a second Trilby. Dr. Wm. Lang, of Corowa,
N.S.W., is bringing up his children to look witk
contempt on shoes and stockings, and his eldest
daughter astonishes those people who are unaware
of his ideas on hygiene by going everywhere bare-
footed. Whether Miss Lang will continue th<
practice when a few years older remains to b<
seen.
Apropos some Convention election sin
prises. Just after sock-merchant Storey beat
Edmund Barton so badly for Randwick, Storej
stood up in N.S.W. Assembly and made t
characteristically boring speech. When he hat
done, Monaro Miller arose and remarked in hif
dog-growl voice, and with his finger pointing at
Storey: “Mister Speaker,—l am not going t«
make a speech, but I am going, with your pet
mission, to draw the attention of members to tht
fact that that, that, is the man who beat Bartoi
for Randwick.”

Lucien Lesna, the French cyclist, whether
in public on the racing-track, going 30 miles an
hour behind his quintette, or in private lounging
in an arm-chair and caressing a pet opossum, is t
distinct figure in Australian cycling. Essentially
a paced rider, he is the first of his type to visit
Australia ; and although last Thursday (March 4),
in a 20-mile paced race, he beat by three laps
O’Brien, M‘Combe, Meadham and Elliott, re-
lieving each other how they would, neverthelesi
three out of the four vanquished could wallop
Lesna home in an unpaced mile. In France the
paced stayer and the sprinter are distinct specie*
which never conflict. Lesna didn’t start till ’oa
when he was 28 ; now at 32 he gets <£2s a week
salary. He “does not bother about rules of
eating”; he drinks “wine but no spirits”; he
abjures tobacco because “ nicotine is a poisoß
which injures the stomach, and a stayer’s stomach
must be perfectly healthy ”; he goes to bed a*
half-past nine and gets up at seven. The prize*
for Australian handicap races seem to him out of
all proportion—“ a third-class man gets such a

start that he can win .£lOO, .£2OO, or .£304
first prize; in France he couldn’t win more
than <£B or £lO until he became first-class. "
The rubbing-down, which is so big jan essen-
tial in the Australian cyclist’s creed, brings
a smile from Lesna—“ Third-class man crawl*
half-a-mile, comes in, and is rubbed do we
one hour ; in France we ride 50 mile, wipe off tht
sweat —it is finished.” The Australian’s love fo»
laying his shirt upon his fancy is a new order os
things to Lesna ; “ in France’they all go, but only
to see the racing—all together do not bet five
bobs.” He thinks the Sydney Cricket Ground
track is beyond comparison the first in Australia |
it is so good, indeed, that he will attempt upon i!
to lower the world’s five-mile record—9min. 16se6,
Lesna’s business is record-breaking and long-dig-
tance racing behind pace, but, all the same, W. J,
C. Elliott, who rode second in the last A.N.A,
and third in the last Austral, but has never raced
behind pace in his life, will take a lap start and
give Lesna a five-mile go. Bilmartin, too, ig
spoiling for Lesna’s scalp, and it is almost agreed
that the pair have a match one mile unpaced, fm
and ten miles paced, at St. Kilda on 10th April,
for .£250 and a side wager of .£lOO. Should
Martin get the pacing he expects, he will giv*
Lesna the battle of his life.

aches, the depressed feelings, the pains, the dis-
couragements, indeed, almost all the misery has a
common cause—weakness. At such times a

upon, and such a friend, for more than twenty

ner s Safe Cure. By its purity and its power it
furnishes a prompt relief for women in their hours

Westralian forthcoming general elections

Chamberlain’s idea, no doubt, is that the
Australian Premiers are coming to London to dis-
cuss with him the new Federal constitution. And
that is how it will, no doubt, eventuate.
One of the surprises of N.S.W. Federal
Convention election is the return of the Silent-
party —Brunker (who hardly spoke at all) and
*. P. Abbott (who spoke not at all). Silence is
folden !
The Federation election “tickets” pub-
lished by the S.A. National Ass and the young
Patriotic League, which is a foal of the Ass in
8.A., omitted every Minister and every Labor
member.
The 1891 election sent fourteen new mem-
bers into S.A. Parliament. Three of them are
*ow dead—and six are already out of politics. A
politician, on an average, lasts just about as long
as a bicycle.
Six, at least, out of the ten N.S.W. dele-
gates to the Convention oppose the transfer of the
State railways to the Federation. Their Federal
policy is to marry the girl—and leave her at the
church door.
The first Convention in Australia was
the Melbourne one, of 1856. It was estab-
lished at the Commercial Hotel, comer of Lons
Sale and Spring streets, not far from Parliament
House, to watch legislative jugglery with the
Land. The heroes were Wilson Gray, Heales,
Hon, Owens, O’Hea, and so forth.
Vic. Attorney-General Isaacs’ Federation
meetings in the country went to show that his
“unpopularity,” much talked about in Melbourne,
floes not extend beyond the Collin s-street gang,
stuck up by his Companies’ Act and Insolvency
Bill. This gang poisonously hates the gritty
Isaacs, and has good reason for doing so.
The Federal Enabling Act specified that
lists of nominated candidates should be advertised
three times in all N.S.W. newspapers. “In some
cases,” wails a country newspaper-man, “there
srere but two insertions and in a few only one,
owing to dilatoriness at head-quarters. Query:
Cannot some lawyer start a vitiating crusade ? ”
S.A. National Ass originally included
Kingston in its Federation ticket, but at the last
moment several prominent Tories used their in-
fluence to have the name erased. Anyhow, the
aflea of the Stomach Men rolling up to vote unani-
mously for Kingston’s name seemed so incongruous
Shat it was just as well matters turned out as
Shey did.
G. Downes Carter, M.P., the Tory drink-
merchant of Melbourne, complains bitterly thab
the Vic. beer-trade has fallen off 50 per cent, of
3ate years, and seems inclined to hold the Turner
Ministry responsible. Perhaps it is. When the
Ctovt. of which Carter was an ornament was in
power, it took much tanglefoot to drown the
public feelings.
When S.A. Ministerialists and Labor-party
combined and issued a Federation ticket in reply
to Tory tactics, the latter began to realise that
Shey stood a strong chance of utterly standing out
an the cold. Then came the wail that the Liberals
were making the election a party one—perhaps
the cheekiest bit of electioneering, considering the
real facts, yet done in S.A.
Premier Turner has neatly capped the
N.S.W. lamentations over its Federal “sacrifices”
by pointing out that Victoria will lose £230,000 a
year in Customs duties. He proposes that the
Federal Treasury should pay it back for the first
two years. Does Turner mean this, or is it
strategic ? It might be a mistake to let N.S.W.
flo all the self-sacrificial posing.
• One dead Federal candidate, George Ash,
vf S.A., went to the poll—though about 20
Sawyers helped to draft the Enabling Act they all
forgot to make provision for withdrawing the
aame of a deceased candidate; and so far as the
returns had come in at time of writing (Monday)
he had scored 308 votes. He stood at the end of
She list, but still he wasn’t far behind the three
Sast live men, Ebenezer Ward, Williams and John
Jones, and as the returns come in from remote
places where his death is less widely known, the
man that’s dead may creep up and leave a good
many live men behind.
A correspondent
writes to heave the
same old curse at the
clumsy, inartistio
name of New South
Wales, and wants to
suggest “Brightland”
as a promising sub-
stitute. This country
has had woeful bad
luck in names. New
South Wales, South
Australia, West Aus-
tralia (now Westra-
lia), New Zealand
(now Maoriland), and
the Northern Terri-
tory are about the
clumsiest samples of
nomenclature going.
Victoria and Queens-
land are better be-
cause they consist of
one word only ; Tas-
mania is better still.
All the same, The
Bulletin isn’t taking
any “Brightland.” It
seems almost hopeless
to look for a short,
appropriate, euphoni-
ous name with any
special fitness about
it, unless the mother
province is called
plain “ Possum,” yet
the necessity for find-
ing new names must
be faced sometime.
No country in its
senses can propose to
struggle for ever with
a designation like
N.S.W. or S.A. or
W.A. or N.T. It
would be better to
call the country plain
Z. and be done with it.
After ten years of
Prohibition with its
paraphernalia of
“ clubs ” and sly-grog
shops, the Chaffey
colony at Renmark
(S.A.) is about to run
a pub or philanthropic pothouse on Gothenburg
lines. S.A. has tried Prohibition at Renmark,
Victoria at Mildura, Maoriland at Clutha, and
the result at all three places has been disgust and
illicit fusel-oil and failure.
The one wholly-unaccountable absentee
from the list of N.S.W. Federal candidates was
Mandarin Quong Tart.
ALLEGED MURDERER BUTLER BEHIND THE BARS.
(From San Francisco “Call.”)
Miss Spence, of S.A., the only lady
Federal candidate in Australia, stands about 23rd
on the list, and is evidently hopeless.
Watt, an A.N.A. “orator,” is already
organising committees in the fashionable parts of
the North Melbourne electorate with a view to
ousting Labor-member Prendergast next election.
HE WAS SATISFIED.
PAL (very drunk after the races): “ Ten pounds isn’t a bad win—hie —but I
wish it had been ten thousand.”
OTHER PAL: “ Why complain? We couldn’t have got any drunker than
we are ”
The S.A. village settlements, six months
ago, lost their father and best friend by the death
of Lands Minister Gillen. Now their most im-
placable enemy, George Ash, has gone. The
latter represented the district in which they are
located, but he never lost an opportunity of in-
veighing against the crime of the Government in
advancing them money.
A rumour., which the Kingston Govt,
would do well to explain or repudiate, has it that
S. A.’s refusal to pay her agreed-on share towards
Thursday Island fortifications was in consequence
of a bombardier relative of an influential S.A.
politician not obtaining a billet from the Thurs'-
day Island authorities.
At N.S.W. Federation poll about 148,000
electors voted out of about 260,000 qualified to
vote,, or 57 per cent, of the whole. At last Parlia-
mentary election 64 per cent, voted ; and, as
Federation still only exists in theory, and Parlia-
ment has a very practical application to local
roads and bridges, there is no cause to complain
of comparative want of public interest.
Anent Yic. protests, backed municipally,
against the lack of any provision except gaol for
the aged poor, the Yic. Local Government Act in
force for the last 2.3 years gives Councils power to
provide for them out of the rates, and to raise
money by loan to build and maintain asylums and
other places for the aged poor. Yet everyone in
Yic. is howling for an Act of Parliament in the
matter, the parish Pecksniffs especially.
During the N.S.W. Convention election it
was pointed out that because an elector could vote
anywhere double voting and dummying would
occur. As a matter of fact, it is impossible for
anyone to vote twice on one right, as when a vote
is recorded the right is stamped. Also, a polling-
deputy can easily stop fraudulent voting by asking
the elector to sign his name for comparison with
the signature on the right. The electoral right is
one of the best of all possible voting safeguards.
Why doesn’t the National Ass dig up a
poet ? The Fat world is weary waiting for a
singer who can glorify greed in stately measure
and stir the souls of men with strong, sweet words
in defence of the poor, down trodden mortgagee.
The urgent need was proved the other day by a
Fat Tas. Federation candidate, who advertised
Lawson’s “Star of Australasia ” as a recitation at
one of his meetings—obviously because he couldn’t
find anything worth reciting in the literature of
Corpulency.
Energetic efforts were made by Melb.
Freetraders to damn Trenwith’s Convention
chances just previous to the election. Accusations
of refusing to pay up to his union and of infidelity
to the members were scattered wholesale, and a
leaflet accusing Trenwith of going to the boss of a
man who had attacked him on a public platform
and getting him the sack was profusely distributed
where it would do most good for Foreign-trade
and Tory principles. The tract bore the imprint
of the Freetrade Democratic Association. All
lies ; the man in question had not been sacked at
all.
Three Scotchmen were included among
the successful conventwners for Victoria, but
ne’er an Irishman got through. Dr. Quick’s
position of second on the list was a strik-
ing testimony to the efficacy of advertising. Even
in Collingwood the Bendigo champion, who had
been the first man to publish his “platform,”
came next to Turner at the poll, beating Berry,
Trenwith, and Peacock by a few score votes m
each case. Simon Fraser, M.L.C., the one other
advertiser, found 1033 supporters in democratic
Collingwood, and was the only Councillor, bar Pre-
sident Zeal, to get any votes worth mentioning.
The N.S.W. Freetrade Government has
decided to protect local industry some more by
letting to a local firm a tender for 40,000 blankets
at Bs. sd. each. The price for an imported lot of
only 2000 blankets was 7s. 9d., arid this much
larger lot could presumably have been bought still
cheaper. Therefore Premier Reid’s blanket-man
gets 9 per cent. Protection at the least, and pos-
sibly 12 or 15 per cent. The scheme for surrepti-
tiously protecting the steel rail industry, however,
fell through. One tenderer wanted <£150,000
more than the imported price. Another merely
asked that Govt, should guarantee 3$ per cent,
interest on his capital, which might mean £lO,OOO
or .£700,000, or any other sum above the importers’
price, and was altogether too vast an undertaking.
So G. Reid kills one-half of his Freetrade deity,
and sticks by the other half to the last till next
time.
After such things as these, who worships
what is called success? Dan O’Connor, 21,826
votes ; E. D. Millen, 10,034. Where is there a
more empty and exploded skiter than Dan
O’Connor —but Dan O’Connor is picturesque and
has advertised himself; whereas Millen, a hard
student, good speaker and master of his subject,
labors under the disadvantage of not having
been continuously bathed in printer’s ink for
30 years. John Bridge, a non - Federationist,
who can’t put together three coherent
political words, 18,724 votes; Dr. Cullen, a
keen and cultured publicist, solid for Australian
unity, 13,013. Cow-merchant Brunker,grotesquely
dumb on the subject of Federation through sheer
political ignorance and stupidity, 76,691 ; B.
R. Wise, an ardent Federationist and learned
constitutional lawyer, unsurpassed as a debater.
56,873.


Premier Reid probably spent less on his
Federation candidature than any other prominent
N.S.W. candidate, save Abbott. The prudent
patriot who footed the b.ggest bill in the 49 was
eventually 41st joint in the procession.
J ohn Forrest had on 4th March held
the Westralian Premiership for six years, two
months and six days. This breaks the previous
Australian record-that of Herbert, of Queens-
land, by about three weeks. The third-best record
for enduranoe was M'Gulloch’s four years and
eleven months in Victoria ; then Gillies’ four years
and nine months in the same province, and Parkes’s
four years and sixteen days in N.S.W. In Maori-
land, Stafford put up a record of five years one
month and lOdays, and another of nearly four years;
and oeddon, with nearly four years to his credit
an . u new Parliament behind him, looks as if he
might putup the Australasian record par excellence.
Another kind of record was put up by old Henry
Ayers, who was seven times Premier of S.A., and
only ruled for four years and one month alto-
gether.
Adelaide newspaper proprietors and politi-
cians are gleeful over the prospect of the Federal
Convention meeting in the city, but Adelaide
Hansard reporters lift up a loud chorus of
“Damn ! ”
Some irreverent vandal has jabbed a pen
knife several times into the oil-painting of the
late J. B. Patterson in Melb. National Gallery.
It is not known whether the culprit is a political
or an art enthusiast.

CIRCULAR.
Dear Sir,
We now beg to notify to you that on the Ist prox. we add to our well-
known Stock and Station Agency business that of Wool and Produce Salesmen.
This is quite a legitimate branch of our business that we now take up with
confidence.
We have secured the services of Mr. Edward N. Row, lately with Messrs.
Campbell, Nimtno & Co., formerly with Messrs. Goldsbrough & Co., and Dalgety
& Co., of Melbourne, who will conduct this branch of our business under the
supervision of our Managing Directors, and whose acknowledged business
capacity and energy, combined with the well-known position and standing of
this Company, are sufficient guarantee that any Wool or Produce entrusted to
our care will be disposed of to the best advantage.
Our Produce Stores are situated on the Circular Quay and Macquarie Street,
are large, well-lighted, and in every way convenient. Wool Stores we will secure
before the opening of next Wool Season, our present accommodation being ample
for any Wool offering during the Winter months.
As in our Stock business, you may rely that we will conduct this branch of
our business strictly as Selling Brokers only ; neither directly nor indirectly will
we entertain any interest in Produce committed to our care beyond that of realis-
ing the highest price. Buyers, too, may know that they will compete only with
legitimate competitors.
Our Produce Sales commence after the Ist March ; but our Stores are now open
for the reception of consignments, which, small or large, shall have equal attention ;
a bag of cow hair, a few horns, sheepskins, or shank bones, will be cared for equally
with 1000 bales of wool, casks of tallow, or hides.
Kindly note also that we remove from our old offices to new and more com-
modious ones in O’Connell Street, on Ist April.
Yours faithfully,
W. WRIGHT, Secretary,

ANOTHER MIRACLE IN SYDNEY.
A CRIMEAN VETERAN AND GOOD
TEMPLAR RECOUNTS HIS RE-
COVERY FROM A LIVING DEATH.
Mr. Charles Terry, a Crimean veteran, of 485
Rent-street, Sydney, having been lecturing lately
in the Domain on the “ Temperance Question,” we
(says the Newspaper) despatched a reporter to his
residence, who gives the following verbatim ac-
count of his illness and marvellous recovery. Our
representative found Mr. Terry a chatty old gen-
tleman of 66, who seemed decidedly pleased to be
interviewed on the subject of his wonderful escape
from death. In response to a few questions, Mr.
Terry stated :—“ I joined the Royal Navy about
1853, and served during the Crimea in H.M.S. Re-
triburion, Captain Thomas Fisher, under Admiral
Dundas, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Baines,
and I bear the Crimean decoration. I arrived in
Australia at the latter end of 1877 in H.M.S.
Sapphire, the Hon. Captain Merry. I then joined
the Diamond, under Captain Dale, on this station,
and on leaving the ship quitted the service for good,
having in all served in 17 ships in Her Majesty’s
Royal Navy, during which time I was employed
as Admiral’s, Commodore’s, and Captain’s cook.
In August of this year (1896) I found myself at
Emu Plains, being in the employ of Messrs.
M'Grath, fellmongers, employed as cook. It was
whilst there that I was taken ill, towards the
latter end of August. I attributed my illness to
exposure in periodically leaving a hot kitchen to
attend to some outside work. My first symptoms
were coughing, a spitting of blood, and a bloody dis-
charge from the kidneys of the consistency of jelly.
One man there was particularly kind to me, arid
constantly stayed up with me all night, giving me
eucalyptus to inhale, and continually rubbing it
into my chest, throat, and stomach. This man
kept constantly telling me to clear out from Emu
Plains and go to hospital, otherwise, to use his
own words, he said, ‘ You will peg out.’ Feeling
that he was likely to prove a true prophet, I fol-
lowed his advice, came to Sydney, and took up my
abode at 485 Kent-st., where I still am living. I
should, however, mention that both Mr. and Mrs.
M'Grath gave me the highest of references, and
regretted that my bad health would not allow me
to remain. (These recommendations, which were
of a most satisfactory nature, he showed our re-
presentative.) On my arrival in Sydney I suffered
from great pains in the back and sides, and also
under the ribs. I could take no solid food, and I
entirely subsisted on eggs and new milk, which
my landlady procured for me. I went to see the
Government medical officer at Circular Quay, and
was so horribly weak that it took me an hour and
ten minutes to get there. He told me to strip,
which I did, and he then sounded me and asked
me how long I had been bad. I told him that
from the first it was about eight weeks, upon
which he said, ‘Get away, man; it’s chronic.’
He could not send me to Little Bay, but suggested
that I should go to Liverpool Asylum at once, but
I refused to go there, and returned home. I then
went to see the Grand Chief Templar. I also saw
his wife and the Grand Lodge Secretary, and told
them of my pitiable state. With the assistance of
Brother J. C. .Jones, late District Deputy of the
Good Templars, and the Grand Lodge Secretary,
I had medicine prescribed for me of various kinds,
which proved quite ineffectual, and afforded me
no relief whatever. I took no less than seven
bottles of eucalyptus, and even chlorodyne was
prescribed for me. I fell away lamentably, per-
spired profusely, and could not obtain any sleep.
I was in such pain that I could not shift in bed.
My right side was much the worst, and my breath-
ing was most labored and painful. I cannot be
too grateful to my friend, Brother J. C. Jones.
He would stay with me for three or four hours at
a time, and it was he that saved me from going to
an asylum. One day a friend of mine read to me
the account of Boilermaker Jarvis’s wonderful re-
covery by taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and I
at once procured a box. I had taken all but
two, when the blood-spitting and emission
ceased. After two boxes I was able to get up and
move about, and now, at the end of six boxes, feel
almost well, with the exception of feeling very
weak. The cure was MAGICAL, and I tell all
my friends and the general public that nothing but
Dr. Williams’ Pills brought me once more before
them to agitate the temperance question, and on
each occasion I have met with a great reception.
(Mr. Terry here called our reporter’s attention to
the amount of useless physic he had consumed,
and, indeed, the amount of bottles reminded one
of the interior of a chemist’s shop.) I can speak
in the highest possible terms of the marvellous
curative properties of the Pink Pills. On my
visits to and lectures in the country I shall con-
sider it my duty to suffering humanity to recount
my astounding cure, and I trust I may be the
means of saving the life of many a despairing
mortal.—CHAS. TERRY.”
(Signed on oath and in the presence of Charles
Lovely, J. P.)
Our reporter, on making enquiry, has discovered
that Mr. Terry was, no later than yesterday (Sun-
day, December 27th), speaking in the Domain for
the benefit of humanity on the marvellous cure he
received from the Pills, and it is his intention to
continue to do so during all his temperance lec-
tures, as he feels it is a duty he owes to society.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills strike at the root of
disease, driving it from the system and restoring
the patient to health and strength. They consti-
tute a perfect blood-builder and nerve-restorer,
curing such diseases as rheumatism, lumbago,
sciatica, neuralgia, partial paralysis, St. vitus
dance, indigestion, &c. They are also a specific
for the troubles which make the lives of so many
women a burden, and speedily restore the rich
glow of health to pale and sallow cheeks. Obtain-
able from chemists and storekeepers generally, or
sent (post paid) by Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,

“The Patents, Trade Marks and Copyright
Laws form one of the most complicated branches
of legal science.” This is true, and it is practi-
cally impossible for any one unacquainted with
their technicalities to draw specifications and
claims, &c., that will stand the test of a law-suit.
Hitherto expert Patent agents have made charges
simply prohibitive to most inventors, but Mr.
Arthur Griffith, M.L.A., of 39 Castlereagh-
street (next Hotel Australia), Sydney, and Bolton-
street, Newcastle, having established reciprocal
arrangement with leading Patent agents in all the
principal countries in the world is now prepared
to do the work accurately and effectively at rates
that will place a patent within reach of the poorest
invencor. For the sum of £2O (exclusive of cost of
drawings) he will obtain a certificate of Provisional
Protection (in the first instance) for any invention
in the seven Australasian colonies and Great
Britain, and full Patents all over the world at
similarly reasonable rates. Mr. Griffith also
makes a specialty of designing and registering
Trade Marks and Copyrights.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Not one of the Victorian racing “ prophets ”
gave Coil any sort of chance for the Australian Cup, five
days before the race. Several of them picked Fadladeen,
and one (the LEADER-man) chose Resolute, a horse that
hadn't done nearly enough work for such a journey.
Coil’s return to “form” set people thinking
again of last season when he and Newhaven used to play
a game of one down, t’other come up. For the first
time in Australian turf history the champion two-year-
olds of one season have proved rival handicap winners in
the next.
Melb. Herald said of Bloodshot: “He ran in
the Essendon Stakes and failed to get a place, but per-
haps it would be as well not to pay too much attention to
this performance, as his stable companion, Warpaint,
started a warm favorite in this event.’’ How comforting
for owner Harvey (who never bets, but races for stakes
only) to be told that his horse was making the running
for a stable companion, the property of his trainer,
Power! And, by the way, several newspapers said the
same thing quite casually, as though the interests of Mr.
Harvey were bound to be subservient to the interests of
the “ stable.”
Five years in succession an “ odds on” favorite
for the V.R.C. Leger has been beaten. They were Derby
winners, all of them. In ’93 Camoola lost because it was
raining at the time, and he objected to getting wet, they
said. In ’94 Carnage lost because he had “ gone to pieces
since the Spring in ’95 The Harvester “ wasn’t himself
on the day ” ; last year Wallace’s jockey allowed the out-
sider, Cabin Bov, to run away with the race; and this
year Newhaven “ lacked condition.” By turning up the
English racing calendars and noting how seldom a Derby
winner fails to win the Doncaster St. Leger (with odds
laid on him) a punter may easily satisfy himself that the
training system, or the climate, or the jockeyship, or the
equine characteristics of this great country make “rela-
tive form” a ridiculously unreliable thing to bet upon, as
compared with the same r.f. in the original land of the
thoroughbred.
* * •
Herewith a little racing food for the guileless
punter to chew. In the Leger race The Officer romped
away from Newhaven (first favorite) at even weights over
1J miles, and was much the fresher of the pair after their
gallop. In the Australian Cup, a slow-run 21 miles, The
Officer (first favorite) was beaten many lengths by Coil at
even weights. In the slower-run Champion, which was
practically a 1J mile event, Newhaven easily beat The
Officer, who beat Coil (first favorite), all at the same
weight. And j-et the multitude cheered lustily ! The
race was a preposterous upset of “ latest form,” but the
public appeared satisfied, and the V.R.C. stewards said
nothing, as usual.
More food. In the Hopeful Stakes red-hot
favorite Manfred was easily beaten at even weights by
Waraka, whose jockey never moved on the colt, whilst
Manfred was being walloped to no purpose. Waraka
started second favorite at 4tol on this occasion. Five
days later Waraka and Manfred met again, at a difference
of 31bs. only. Manfred was again a “ hot pot,” but this
time Waraka had no friends at 10 to 1. Manfred won in
a canter, and Waraka finished last in a field of nine.
Another tough morsel. In the Brunswick
Stakes (1J miles) Lilith (7st. 91b.), starting at 7 to 1, took
the lead at the mile and just got home in front. The
mare’s performance suggested that she would have pre-
ferred to finish at the mile. Three days later Lilith (Bst.
71b.) started for the Bourke Handicap of one mile. Her
price was 12 to 1, and she finished nowhere. Another
two days interval. Then Lilith started for the River
Handicap (1J miles) and carried Bst. 31b. to a very easy
victory.
The Maiden Stakes race, last week, was a pain-
fully funny procession. Reka, an odds-on favorite, came
East the distance-post six lengths ahead of the second
orse, the other three stragglers following at equally long
intervals. Marusa (a onetime Melb. Cup favorite) brought
up the rear, about 24 lengths behind Reka, and little boy
Redfearn amused himself by making a show of riding
Marusa desperately as the winner “ walked in.”
James Gough distinguished himself in one of
the preliminary canters at Flemington last week. Long-
legged Jim was giving Loyalty a breather past the stand,
when his cap fell off. He seemed to lose his head along
with his cap, for, whilst turning round to look for' the
missing articles, Jim’s boAv fell out of the saddle and re-
ceived a nasty shaking.
• * * *
Considered in the light of his race for the Loch
Plate last Saturday, not to mention his Champion victory,
Newhaven’s performance in the Leger now ranks as a very
remarkable affair, and if the V.R.C. stewards are content
to let it go without an enquiry, the long-suffering public
had better ask themselves whether horse-racing at Flem-
ington is any longer a matter for intelligent sporting
interest. The Bulletin will merely say that, in the light
of subsequent running, Newhaven appears to have been
“ dosed ” —with water, or what not—by some person or
persons unknown previous to the Leger race The sus-
picious surroundings of Newhaven’s Leger fiasco are re-
vealed in the light of “respectable” newspaper comments.
The Argus said of it—“ According to good judges, New-
haven was not half fit. He looked soft, and was sweating
before the battle had begun. . . The betting was
peculiar. ‘ I’ll take 4to I,’ was the cry for some time,
but at the last moment it was possible for the admirers of
Newhaven to get on by laying 9to 4. . . Newhaven
and The Officer will meet again in the Champion Stakes
on Thursday, and then racing men will see what they will
see.”
They saw Newhaven win the Champion Stakes
in the easiest possible style. It wasn’t a severe three-
mile race, but it was at least as genuine a test of condition
in horseflesh as the lf-mile gallop for the Leger. New-
haven looked blooming, not soft. He didn’t sweat before,
during, or after the gallop. In short, the difference
between the two performances was not to be accounted
for by natural causes as far as one could reasonably sup-
pose. Said the Age—“ Only one look was required to see
that Newhaven was in much improved condition—and
not a few good judges declared that he appeared almost
as well as in the spring, although it was hard to believe
that his mentor could have effected such a change in his
condition in such a short time. From sto 1 the colt
rapidly shortened to 3to 1.” And the Argus (which had
advised racing men to look out for what they would see)
remarked “ it is ten thousand pities that the escutcheon
of a horse possessing the phenomenal powers that New-
haven is known to possess should be besmirched by per-
formances which would discredit the meanest selling-
plater. Newhaven’s form has been most inconsistent.”
What would happen in the case of a mean
selling plater displaying such discreditably inconsistent
form ? The owner, trainer and jockey would be called
upon to show good reason for the horse’s in-and-out per-
formances, and, if the explanation were not satisfactory,
certain pains and penalties would ensue to somebody.
How preposterous were the commonly accepted
Springtime excuses for Newhaven’s defeat in the Caul-
field Guineas! It was then said that the horse got beaten
because he wasn’t allowed to gallop away with the race,
making his own running. Which is just what Newhaven
didn’t do in the Champion and Loch Plate. Will it now
be said that he lost the Leger through being ridden on
the lines of his sensational Derby and Cup victories?
Mischief ran very indifferently on Champion
day. In the Autumn Handicap (13 furlongs), the mare
(carrying Bst. 21b.) met Response at an advantage of 71b.,
and was decisively beaten by Dan O’Brien’s candidate.
Later in the afternoon, she ran unplaced and unbacked
for the River Handicap (1J miles), being beaten by Don
John (7st. lib.) among others. On Saturday, in the Place
Handicap (10 furlongs), Mischief met Response again, on
only 51b. better terms, also Don John on 71b. better terms
than before. This time, the daughter of Commotion took
the lead a long way from home, and won comfortably. If
a slight improvement in handicap-terms can effect so con-
siderable an improvement in a horse’s running, it is about
time that punters ceased trying to find winners. The all-
round mediocrity of Australian thoroughbreds makes
them so susceptible to small changes in handicap condi-
tions (seemingly) that a 71h. penalty for winning “after
the declaration of the weights ” is a preposterous burden
to add to any horse’s original impost. Seven ounces
would, on paper, bring A. back to B. next time they meet.
The books harl a queer experience with the All-
Aged Stakes last Saturday. They laid 6 to 4 against a
“ placement ” of the three horses as they would finish,
and punters were about equally divided in their fancies—
Aurum, Coil, The Officer, or Aurum, The Officer, Coil.
Aurum won, and the three-year-olds ran a dead-heat for
second place, consequently they all won at the rate of ss.
on every £ invested.
When it came to the Loch Plate the books took
5 to 4 about placing the three starters one way, and even
money about placing them the other way,
being chosen, of course, as the winner in both ways. Ikey
Mo, therefore, stood to win all his wagers in the event of
Newhaven dropping dead. Otherwise, he would either
win a trifle, or come off quits if he “ fielded ” to the same
amount against both selections.

N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League chose Federation
election-day for the opening of its big March carnival;
10,000 people rolled up, and the League shook hands
with itself and wore its hat jauntily all the afternoon.
Lesna, whose big thighs are his only arrestive
feature, made his ddbut in the Electric Handicap, and a
very bad dhmt it was. Starting from scratch he couldn’t
gain an inch on third-class men. In the paced 20-mile
race, however, he caught on tremendously with the
Sydney public. Over 20 miles he beat O’Brien, M'Coombe,
Elliott and Meadham (relieving each other) by three laps.
Lesna, so far, has only shown to advantage as the tail of
a quintet. The pacing-machine is the mind which thinks
and the body which acts ; Lesna attaches himself to it,
and remains there automatically responsive. Lesna and
his machine are one: the automaton pedals without
swaying, without apparent effort. The subjection of his
will and intelligence to the quintet or quad is doubtless
the reason why Lesna is lost in a handicap or unpaced
race. He is then a tail without a body and mind. And a
drearily hopeless tail he is.
What a contrast between the Frenchman and
Yankee Martin ! Martin is active-brained, of invincible
will. He beats faster sprinters than himself home because
he thinks and dares more than they. Martin and a com-
petitor will be racing side by side watching the ruck just
ahead—watching for the opportunity to go through. Of a
sudden Martin dashes while his competitor’s heart beats
wildly because of the smash so imminent. But Martin
has slipped through by the skin of his teeth ; there was
no opportunity, so Martin has made one, and is flying
away with another spurt while the man who was beside
him a moment before is still hopelessly behind the ruck
waiting for a chance to get through. Defeating all the
stewards and getting his two years’ disqualification re-
moved is another instance of his winning with all the
chances tremendously against him.
Look at Martin last Thursday, too. He wanted
to catch the 5.15 train to Melb. in order to compete in
the races there on Saturday. There were 20min. for him
to win or lose the International Scratch Race, to jump
into a cab, and to catch the express for Melb. He came out
and as every minute was precious he took the lead the
last three laps. Just after the bell rang he started his
spurt with Payne and Edwards hanging on his wheel. If
the spurt had been shorter both men could have beaten
him. But he took the steam out of them by his long-
sustained effort. He won 120, rushed off and caught his
train, and arriving in Melb. after his long train journey,
he beat Porta, Walne, Megson, Walker, Middleton, and
the rest in the five miles (£3O). What a hack this man
would make of Lesna in an unpaced race over any
distance 1
There is no doubt of Lesna’s capacity to follow
pace, and when he gets really fit, which should be in a
few weeks time, he will still further reduce his present
Australian records. There will be concerted endeavors
from many quarters shortly to lower existing Aus. records.
One big firm has long contemplated devoting a whole
fortnight to record-breaking.
* * * •
The only cyclist in Australia possessing a Jaw
more stony and more noticeable than Bilmartin’s is
Megson, and Megson Wits the man who took Bill down.
The heat of the Scratch Mile at Melb. cycle-show, where
this calamity occurred, was the scene of more excitement
than the Exhibition Oval has held since Zimmerman was
beaten. The race was practically between the two, and
was a fair and square go without the slightest element of
luck. Only the officials and perhaps a dozen others at the
mark were able to tell who won, so close a thing was it.
When the final came, Megson owned every barracker on the
ground, and when he won from Walne and Porta there
was a repetition of the public enthusiasm. This heat was
a close thing, too, but Megson wasn’t exhausted to the
same extent as when he met the Plugger.
Taken altogether, the racing at the last day of
the cycle-show was the best seen in Melb. this year : all
the other big meetings have been spoilt by suspicious run-
ning. The pace was generally fast, and the finishes excit-
ing, and the fact that Kuhle had a heavy fall in the after-
noon and Finnegan had his ear torn off in the evening
served to cheer up those football barrackers who are
forced to witness cycling in the off season.
Don Walker brought down the quarter and half-
mile records at St. Hilda last week, and next morning his
cut at Lesna’s mile only failed by 1 l-ssec., and that in
the face of wind and rain.

The three Delevines, now at Melb. Opera
House, were in the top rank of Eng. cyclists, and together
formed one of the triplets which paced diminutive
Michael through a heap of records.

A. C. Edwards, the Eng. cyclist now racing in
Sydney, was married three weeks before leaving for, Aus-
tralia. Edwards wanted to bring Mrs. E. with him, but
Green, the Bilmartin of the combination, vetoed the sug-
gestion. Take ye warning by Zimmerman, O cyclists.

George Giffen is just now regarded in Adelaide
as the world’s greatest cricket captain. When S.A. lost
her matches this season a great howl went up in Adelaide
that it was all owing to Giffen. When Evans, Bailey,
Lyons and F. Jarvis dropped catches that cost hundreds
of runs the S.A. critics unanimously put it down to
George. But it’s all right now. S.A. beat Victoria in
Adelaide by an innings and some odd runs, and Gitten
reigns once more. In fact, a nice storm came up ® n tne
Sunday, and spoilt the Vic.’s second innings, and b.A.
cricketers are very pleased to think that their captain
stands so well with Providence.
* * * *
The S. A.-Victoria cricket-matoh again served to
show up the Vic. bowling—even had Trumble been there
things would have been very little better. The four S.A.
crack batsmen made 379 out of 427, and of these “ Oar-
bine ” Lyons made 113 by beautiful cricket. Clem Hill s
95 again proves him to be the most reliable S.A. batsman
of the day. The Vic. bowling was simply helpless, and
the question arises—what will she do next year ? Albert
Trott has gone to England, and Roche and O’Halloran
follow him at the end of this month. On the other hand,
S.A. has been rewarded for persevering with Carracher,
who took 5 wickets for 24 and bowled 11 maidens out of
21 overs.
The S.A.-Victoria match did not enable any
batsman to displace Noble from top place in Australian
averages. Noble with 68.80 is followed by Lyons with
57.71, and as the latter has made 404 runs to Noble’s 344,
things are about even. Lyons’s performance is an
eloquent reply to the crowd who compared him to the
rocket which came down a stick. Carracher’s bowling
performance puts him at the head of the Australian
averages, but M'Kibbin’s 44 wickets stand out above every-
thing else, and, as the Glebe man has third batting
average —50.66—George Giffen has surely met an all-
round rival.
* * * *
Young Edgar Deering has cause to be proud of
his two creations in the sailing line—Stella 11. and Wonga.
Bad luck sticking to them during the Sydney carnival,
the knowing crowd voted them failures, but George Ellis
has shown what could be done with the Stella by again
winning last Saturday. On Saturday week Wonga forgot
to carry away something, as per usual, and scored a clever
win.
Sydney boat-sailing shows as much “reversal
of form ” as racing or trotting. Effie won three races
in succession, ran nowhere for a few more, and
then came out with Nick Johnson at the tiller and beat
the Vigilant.

Some of the Sydney tote-shops had doubles on
the N.S.VV. Federal elections for first and last candidates,
the two favorites being Barton and Foran. No one
thought that “Prudent” Robertson would be the final
tail-joint.

Young Tweedie is now the best-known per-
former at Sydney Amateur Gymnastic Club. Always a
tricky and clever boxer, he is developing the confidence
to make him a fighter. His recent battles with Stoneham
and M'Manus, especially' with the latter, were won very
easily. M'Manus hailed from North Shore with a big
reputation, but he couldn’t touch Tweedie, and w«nt out
in the third round.

The Maoriland Amateur A. A. won’t fall in vmh
Vic. and N.S.W. re sending an athletic team ’Ome, aver-
ring, and rightly, that there is insufficient time between
now and the Eng. champ, meeting. A. H. Holder, winner
of four championships at Auckland, is undoubtedly the
best man in the world over 440yds. hurdles, his 58 4-sths
being a fresh world’s record. What he would have done
on a dry track can only be conjectured. The old sneer
against amateur times as against those of pro’s doesn’t
hold good here, for he was one of the best pro’s in M.L.,
and, after standing down the requisite time, was “ white-
washed ” by the association.

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her life Miserable, but She is
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Head the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg, Victoria, whose por-
trait is also given:
“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-street, Melb., a distance of 660 ft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic: 1, New Books ; 2, Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, Eancy
Goods ; 6, Toys ; 7, Perfumery; 8, Pictures ; 9,

Department, containing half-a-million books. The
main walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long. *
Nothing which is calculated to please a
customer is a trouble to Messrs. Callaghan and
Son. Hence the firm will lengthen or shorten
boots—a most difficult undertaking. They will
replace the fronts of patent boots with new leather,
in cases where people having bought their boots
somewhere else come with the unreliable material
much worn to Callaghan’s. They do repairing of
every description ; from the smallest size in
children’s shoes to men’s ll's. They introduced a
special fastening for buttons, which secures the
buttons against falling off. The coloring of white
satin shoes to match any costume is a great boon
to ladies ; and the attaining of these delicate
shades is an accomplishment which no other house
attempts. The making of special lasts has been
made a study for the comfort of anyone suffering
from deformed feet. Studding the soles of boys’
boots with steel points for school wear is another
appreciated feature in the firm. Last, though not
least, is the staining and cleaning of tan-boots—
turning out as good as new those tan-boots which
have suffered from the wet.*

I Bishop Julius, of Christchurch, M.L.
(formerly Arohdeacon of Ballarat) : —
My own belief ia that Maoriland is a sober country, that
Prohibition is dangerous as a policy, and has very little
chance of success, and that a State system of licensing
control is probably the best for the country.
I Mat Reid, who sat for Toowong in last Q.
i Parliament, once boasted that he represented two
Governors in his constituency, who neither felt
inclined to oppose nor vote for him. The joke
was a grim one, and ’tis said helped to lose Mat
his seat: they were dead Governors, and lay in
. the local cemetery.
The late porter at the Bank of England,
an imposing flunkey named Hoard, seems to have
forfeited his billet under interesting circum-
stances. Hoard drew legitimate salaries and
“ perqs. ” from two sources. During the day he
did duty at the great Bank in flaming scarlet
livery. The night, as a rule, found him in snow-
white garments officiating as carver in one or
other of the halls where the City Companies
devote their bloated revenues to gorge and guzzle.
All the bald-headed magnates, financial and com-
mercial, knowing Hoard in either, or both, of his
solemn city characters, patronised him as a
humble but irreproachable emblem of Hingland’s
greatness. Meanwhile, he ran a snug house at
fashionable Kensington in his extra capacity of
thief. He purchased largely at the Civil Service
Stores, and a detective employed there happened
to spot Hoard, Esq., in one of the few weak
moments when he was “ shaking ” goods clumsily.
Once on his track the “ d.’s ” soon discovered that
their man derived the thick-end of his income from
plunder. He operated upon the solid silver-ware
at the company banquets, and made a hobby of
collecting portable property wherever he might be
left alone with it. Also, he picked the pockets of
Fat Man previous to casting suspicion upon the
waiters. A more versatile comedian never carved
a turkey. The exposure of Hoard has shaken
public confidence. The new porter at the Bank of
England complains that the small boys who hang
around that awful building make his days un-
happy by referring to him indirectly as a burglar
in disguise. The boys have never shown a proper
respect for “ Robin Redbreast (as bank porters
are styled), but it is only of late that they have
started to ask him where he keeps his skeleton-
keys.
According to the Sydney police, quite a
number of small boys are in the habit of sleeping
in the sewers, and are known as sewer rats.

Mudgee Haynes, M.P,, says he approves

The pathos relates to the “ owner,” who was dis-

any baby to come to.
German Veterinary-professor Nocard finds
from examination of public poultry markets that
at least 23 per cent, of all birds sold are tubercu-

besides the danger from tuberculous meat and

farmer himself spreading tuberculosis among
healthy stock, which were certificated clean.

- - - MIRACULOUS CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfaline Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as "he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.
HERR RASSMUSSEN’S
Testimonials.
-A. Few of Them.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
course of your -Ifaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom 1 have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, 1 consider you are deserving of
success, which I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
fully. A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus: To Herr Rassmussen. —Dear
Sir,—l think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCRHAM.
A Much-valued Testimonial from one of
Australia’s Most-Prominent Explorers.
Grand Hotel, Spring-st., Melbourne,
March 7 th, 1896.
To Herr R» ssmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform you that
I have derived great benefit from your celebrated Alfaline
Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. HUTTON
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).
Witness: A. F. teker, Manager, Grand Hotel, Spring-
street, Melbourne.
Mr. Butt 'N writes later:—“The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies."
A Lady’s Testimonial.
It gives me great pleasure to inform you that your
celebrated Alfaline Pills cured me, when all other reme-
dies and doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of
18 years’ standing. Dear Sir, I shall recommend your
Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I come across. Anyone
writing to me will have full particulars.—l am, yours
respectfully, Mrs. E. SMITH.
Port Macquarie, Hastings River, N.S. Wales.
A Miraculous Cure.
The father of Mr. Peter Larsen, the celebrated Band-
master to the Queensland Military, writes as follows :
Ithaca-st., Normanby Hill, Brisbane,
Sept. 20, 1892.
To Urrr Rassmussen.
I am jubilant to inform you that your wonderful Alfa-
line Pills completely cured me of a very obstinate com-
plaint; and that, although I am now over 70 years of age,
I feel as strong as any young man, and shall always be
grateful to you.—Yours very truly, N. LARSEN.
Skin and Blood Cured.
Canning Mills, Canning, Western Australia.
To Herr v<ai-mussen.
1 am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline Blood
Pills completely cured me. Previous to taking your
Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trying your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can
testify to. I have recommended your Alfaline Herbal
Remedies to several of my friends, who have reason to be
very grateful for it.—Yours gratefully, J N ERVIN.
Blood Cured.
Parkes Range, Southern Cross, W.A.
I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Blood Pills completely cured me of a serious blood affec-
tion of three years’ standing. I shall always be glad to
recommend your Alfaline Remedies to my friends.—Yours
gratefully, JAMES NELSON WILLIAMS.
A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medioines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.
C/o Mr. Davidson, Geralda Station, Cootamundra,
N.S.W.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer
from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading
doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. I ain thankful I did so, for
after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies I am now
completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.
As Witness: John Hagerman (my husband), 95 Castle-
reagh-st., Sydney.
A Sufferer Cured of Piles.
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. I
have not been troubled with them since, and it is non
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who bless the dav I told them about it. I cannot
thank you enough for the cure your Remedies effected
in my case, and the relief it gave me from continuous
suffering. J. KILLERIDGE,
Lucknow, N.S.W.
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your 5 Ifaiine Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.

WILLIAM HANSON,

REFERRING TO
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press: —
Sydney Bnllctin.— “ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will
prove.”
Evening News, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen has
shown us some highly complimentary testimonials, certi-
fying to important cures effected by his remedies.”
North Melbourne Advertiser. —“ Herr Rassmussen’s
wonderful Herbal Alfaline Remedies have done more good
than all other known remedies put together.” •
N.Z. Times, Wellington.—“ Herr Rassmussen manu-
factures some excellent Blood and Nerve Remedies."
Daily Telegraph, Launceston, Tas.— “Herr Rass-
mussen is a clever botanist.”
S.A. Register, Adelaide, S.A.—“ Herr Rassmussen's
Press notices agree as to the skill he possesses as a
botanist, and the bona fides of his testimonials appear to
be well established.”
C’ooktown Courier, Queensland. —“ Herr Rassmus-
sen, we are glad to say, holds the highest place in the
colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land."
Flashes (Society Paper), Brisbane, Q.—“ Herr Pass-
mussen’s labors have resulted in a manner most gratifying
to himself, inasmuch as he has received the highest re-
cognitions of the most important scientific authorities.”
Chemist and Druggist Journal, Melbourne.-
“Herr Rassmussen has opened a branch depdt at 150
Bourke-street, Melbourne, and his Alfaline Pills will pro-
bably become as well known in Victoria as they are in
New South Wales.”
Evening Journal, Adelaide.—“ Herr Rassmussen
has achieved a-high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanical remedies.”
Sydney Trut*>, — “ Herr Rassmussen is sufficiently well
known not to r quire any additional praise from Truth.
His remedies are simply wonderful.”
Sunday Times, Sydney.—“lt may not be out of
place to mention that Herr Rassmussen has now been be-
fore the public for over ten years.”
N.Z. Mail, Wellington.—“ We have among us at the
present time one of Australia’s foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rasmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist of
Sydney.”
The Australian Workman, Sydney.—“ Having
seen and examined letters from all parts of the world, we
are assured that Herr Rassmussen’s Alfaline Remedies
have saved a world of suffering, and his remedies have
cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Nord Anstralisehe Zeitung, Brisbane.—“We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-
amined letters from all parts of the world, we are satisfied
that he is deserving of universal thanks.”
Australian Star, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become
known throughout New South Wales and Australia.”
The above selected Press opinions are quite sufficient
to show the esteem Herr Rassmussen is held in by those
who have the best opportunity to watch his career.

himself—wants a nice, quiet place to stay at,
handy to the centres of business and pleasure,
luxuriously conducted, yet without too much irri-
tating fuss and frill, and without an enormous bill
at the end of his visit. And in Roberts’ Hotel
the average man gets just that.*
Salisbury’s “triumph of diplomacy” in
connection with the Cretan jumble is merely a
repetition of several other alleged successes. Crete
was given self-government in ’6B, and nine years
later its chaotic condition resulted in full parlia-
mentary powers being granted. The plucky
islanders have been fighting Turkey for upwards
of two centuries, and nothing short of absolute
separation will satisfy them. Salisbury’s victory
is a triumph of timidity, which merely postpones
the inevitable European burst-up for another year
or two, until Bull or one of the other “Powers”
feels sure-footed enough to fly into an incompre-
hensible temper about nothing in particular.
SIR JOHN Power’s whiskey is now dis-
tributed all over Australia and New Zealand, and
can therefore be pronounced the spirit of Federa-
tion. It has great advantages over the other
spirits of Federation, because first acquaintance
with it is convincing of its permanent good, and
because it belongs to the practical—not the theo-
retical. The London Wine and Spirit Gazette
says of this whiskey : “It stands highest in the
London whiskey market, and can challenge the
world as the finest spirit distilled.” This whiskey
is made from the best quality barley, and exclu-
sively in the old pot-still. There is no Indian
corn in its manufacture—no rubbish, no patent
still. Its history begins with 1791, and the chief
warehouse has a storage capacity for 36,000 hogs-
heads. You had better try SIR JOHN Power’s
whiskey.*
Several dozen sound old Tories met and
liquored old Duncan Gillies on his return to Mel-
bourne, and slobbered painfully over that ancient
failure. The climax was reached, however, when
G. D. Carter, the evil genius of Patterson’s Minis-
try, hoped that Duncan had returned to give Vic-
toria the benefit of his “ wise head, cool judgment,
andcommonsense.” Duncan wasthernaddestpoliti-
cal boomer, the worst spendthrift, the most reckless
borrower and chucker-away of money on wild-cat
railways, and the most affably thick-headed man
who ever let things slide in Victoria ; and yet he
dropped a tear quite seriously in the brimming
cup over Carter’s eulogy, and almost wept at the
contemplation of his own vast sagacity. And
the meeting agreed, with deep emotion all round,
that Victoria was saved now that slow, fat,
dunderheaded Duncan had come back on his two
short legs to buzz round the scene of his own and
his country’s downfall.
A Westralian number of the Clarion,
edited by Randolph Bedford, is the most imposing
work of boom fiction ever produced on this
side of the Equator. Gold glitters on the front
cover, tempting one to explore the Clarion’s
interior. The contents comprise about 70 pages
of descriptive matter f intersected by some 500
photo’s., all tending to the glory of mines and
mine-promoters in the Land of Bedfordian Pro-
mise. To read is to believe, or nearly so. Any-
way, Truth bows her diminished head before the
editor’s version of the Golden West as it is, and
scepticism gets blown away by the hot wind of his
prophetic preface. “Westralia will be dotted
with cities living on reefing when generations
hence have become impalpable ashes.” Amen !
Meanwhile, here’s to the health of our versatile
friend, Randolph the Reefer ! May he lie long
ere he lies low, promoting the happiness of him-
self and co-directors until his share of Nature’s
debt be fully paid up, and may his last successful
“ float ” be upon the gracious bosom of the Jasper
Sea!

Dead Baron von Mueller, some years back,
having read of the bare alkali deserts of south-
western U.S. A.,suggested in his generous altruistic
fashion that Australian salt-bush should be planted
in selected spots and given a fair trial, sending
along a few pounds of different salt-bush seeds for
the purpose. Now the “ bad lands ” sown widely
with salt-bush are producing 20 tons of green and
5 tons of dry food per acre, though formerly as bare
as a billiard-ball. Also, as much as 5 dols.
per lb. has been given for salt-bush seed in Cali-
fornia. Sheep and hogs eat it with avidity, while
cattle and horses gradually acquire a huge liking
for it, after mixing in judiciously incre ising doses
with ordinary food. In its latest report, the Uni-
versity of California especially think < the dead
Baron for his disinterestedness. Jnd still Aus-
tralian pastoralists won’t learn the lesson, perhaps
because distant hills are greenest.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.’’
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.— J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S. W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

The decision of Q. Supreme Court in re-
spect of the succession duty to be paid in Queensland
bv the estate of the late Silas Harding is mainly respon-
sible for the question of succession duty brought before
the Federal Council by Att.-Gen. Byrnes. Silas Harding
left a Q. estate valued at £I3O,(XX), with Q. debts of
£14,000. His executors contended that there was no
succession duty to pay in Q., as the testator had been
“domiciled” in Victoria. Not very long- ago N.S.W.
Supreme Court decided a probate case where a partner,
domiciled in N.S.W., had willed certain Q. property. The
N.S.W. Court ruled that the Q. estate must pay N.S.W.
probate duty to the amount of t 2440. The executors
paid it (in addition to probate duties on N.S.W. pro-
perty), but appealed. The Full Court dismissed the
appeal. Now, according to the Silas Harding ruling, that
Q. estate, which has paid N.S.W. probate duties of £2440,
will have to pay Q. “succession duties.” If the “suc-
cessor ” is a “ stranger in blood ” to the predecessor,
those “ succession duties ” will amount to about £ll,OOO.
Several similar cases are under the attention of Q. Stamp
Department.

A tale comes from the Old World of a scheme—
said to have been formulated by the Russian Government
—for maintaining wheat at a steady price. The idea is
that the Governments of Russia, Austria, the U.S. and
Argentina—the four great wheat-producing countries of
the world—should take the matter in hand, and induce
other grain-growing nations to co-operate. In the first
place, a minimum price is to be fixed for all the markets
of the world. State granaries are to be constructed on a
gigantic scale for the storage of grain—sufficient to hold
the best part of the year’s crop. When there is a surplus
the State will take all the grain offering, and pay the
farmer the fixed minimum price in paper currency—paper
with a wheat basis. Whenever the market will absorb
the store at a price high enough to repay the cost and
leave the needful margin to cover waste and cost of
storage it will be sold again, and the proceeds applied to
the redemption of the paper currency. The advantages
are : (1) The State can afford to keep its stores on hand,
as the money invested in grain will cost it nothing for
interest; (2) "therefore it can take all the grain that offers
at the minimum price, and wait for the lean years which
always come before long; (3) by buying in years of great
plenty, it will prevent prices going ruinously low and the
farmer being financially wrecked for want of a market;
(4) by letting the accumulated surplus loose in years of
scarcity it will prevent prices going ruinously high, to the
disaster of the consumer. It is a huge idea that only a
league of States could attempt, but there seems no
reason why it should not work—when the world gets
sufficiently civilised. Bi-metallists allege that 16oz. silver
can be made worth loz. of gold always and everywhere.
If so, with equally good management ifi bushels of wheat
could be made equally reliable in price. Wheat is no
more unfixable than silver.

Surest sign of the New Guinea boom. The
Queensland Nevermind Govt, has “ under consideration ”
—never mind, there’s no hurry—the question of the desir-
ability of establishing telegraphic communication between
Queensland and New Guinea.
That “ 900 oz. of gold obtained on the Mambare,
New Guinea, by two prospectors” has dwindled down
woefully in significance. It appears now that nine men,
working over a month, made the 9000 z., and since that
find nothing at all has been got, although 25 men have
been working there for three months in terrible distress.
Officially the sum total of gold obtained recently on the
mainland is 1400 oz.

Four sturdy N.Q. miners recently abandoned
Westralia and went over to N. Guinea. Within the last
few weeks the whole four returned to N.Q. to die, the
last one expiring of malarial fever in Cairns Hospi-

from Port Moresby with three miners, two of whom were
prostrate with fever.

Dear Bulletin, —I am an auditor. Let me give
you a recent experience. For 1896 I was auditor to a
limited liability co. doing business up North, and working
under table A of the Q. Act. It became my duty to
require certain alterations in the form of balance-sheet
submiti.ed, so that when certified by me it might give the
information demanded by the Companies Act. I also
required a provision to be made for possible bad and
doubtful debts due to the co. The directors did, in con-
sequence, make a moderate provision, but in their report
issued to the shareholders mentioned that “ this item was
insisted upon by the auditor for reasons best known to
himself. The directors held nearly half the shares of the
co. I was proposed for re-appointment as auditor—but
was not elected.—A.

Still legal money-lending pans out well. First, there are
the costs of the necessary security—seldom less than £2

many cases, the cost of proceedings to recover. Of course,
there are a few bad marks, but there is plenty of margin,

There is one Australian time-payment jewellery
firm which has no less than six of its canvassers in gaol.
The same people can afford to employ an official at a good
salary as a sort of private detective and enquiry man,
who is on good terms with the various members of the
“ foorce,” pawnbrokers, and second-hand dealers gener-
ally. This person’s duties are to find out if any time-pay-
ment jewellery has been “ popped” or otherwise disposed
of, to rouse up and threaten bad pays, and conduct
police-court prosecutions. And as the great bulk of the
parties who get time-payment trinkets have some remote
idea of not paying the full amount, or of swindling and
otherwise dodging the collector, the private detective’s
hands are always full.

The boss of a small co-operative party working
a reef and a small mill in an out-of-the-way locality near
Bright, Gippsland, was induced to get up at about 1 a.m.
recently by a fear that he had not locked the battery
doors. The mill was working one shift only, there was
very little amalgam on the plates, and nobody lived
within five miles, but the visit of inspection was made,
and the miner found the Chow gardener from down the
creek cheerfully scraping the top plate with a hoe-head.
“ John ” was “ laid out,” the rest of the party were called
up, and, after making him “ smell pertickler agony,”
Cow Bung was led home by the pig-tail. Arrived there,
the party searched the pagan’s hut, and found at least
20oz. amalgam, and as much retorted gold. This they
pocketed, swearing it must have been stolen from their
mill. “ Anyhow,” explains the pious Wesleyan boss, “ I
had to punish him for his sin.” /

“ Under your Majesty’s auspices, in little more

greater than those of all the navigators in the

ANOTHER MIRACLE IN SYDNEY.
A CRIMEAN VETERAN RECOUNTS HIS RECOVERY FROM
A LIVING DEATH.
Mr. Charles Terry, a Crimean veteran, of 485 Kent-
street, Sydney, having been lecturing lately in the Domain
on the “ Temperance Question,” we (says the German Post)
despatched a reporter to his residence, who gives the follow-
ing verbatim account of his illness and marvellous recovery.
Our representative found Mr. Terry a chatty old gentleman
of 66, who seemed decidedly pleased to be interviewed on the
subject of his wonderful escape from death. In a response
to a few questions, Mr. Terry stated “ I joined the Royal
Isavy about 1853, and served during the Crimea in H.M.S.
Retribution, Captain Thomas Fisher, under Admiral Dun-
das, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Baines, and I bear the
Crimean decoration. I arrived in Australia at the latter
end of 1877 in H.M.S. Sapphire, the Hon. Captain Merry.
I then joined the Diamond, under Captain Dale, on this
station, and on leaving the ship quitted the service for good,
having in all served in 17 ships of her Majesty’s Royal Navy,
during which time I was employed as Admiral’s, Com-
modore’s, and Captain’s cook. In August of this
year (1896) I found myself at Emu Plains, being in the
employ of Messrs. M'Grath, fellmongers, employed as cook.
It was whilst there that I was taken ill, towards the latter
end of August.. I attributed my illness to exposure in
periodically leaving a hot kitchen to attend to some outside
work. My first symptoms were coughing, a spitting of blood,
and a bloody discharge from the kidneys of the consistency
of jelly. One man there was particularly kind to me, and
constantly stayed up with me all night, giving me eucalyptus
to inhale, and continuously rubbing it into my chest, throat,
and stomach. This man kept constantly telling me to clear
out from Emu Plains and go to hospital, otherwise, to use
his own words, he said, ‘ You will peg out.’ Feeling that he
was likely to prove''a true prophet, I followed his advice,
came to Sydney, and took up my abode at 485 Kent-street,
where I still am living. I should, however, mention that
both Mr. and Mrs. McGrath gave me the highest of
references, and regretted that my bad health would not
allow me to remain. (These recommendations, which
were of a most satisfactory nature, he showed our re-
presentative.) On my arrival in Sydney I suffered
from great pains in the back and sides, and
also under the ribs. I could take no solid food, and entirely
subsisted on eggs and new milk, which my landlady procured
for me. I went to see the Government medical officer at
Circular Quay, and was so horribly weak that it took me an
hour and ten minutes to get there. He told me to strip,
which I did, and he then sounded me and asked me how long
I had been bad. I told him that from the first it was about
eight weeks, upon which he said, ‘ Get away, man ; it’s
chronic. He could not send me to Little Bay, but suggested
that I should go to Liverpool Asylum at once, but I refused
to go there, and returned home. I then went to see the
Grand Chief Templar. I also saw his wife and the Grand
Lodge Secretary, and told them of my pitiable state. With
the assistance of Brother J. C. Jones, late District Deputy
of the Good Templars., and the Grand Lodge Secretary, I
had medicine prescribed for me of various kinds, which
proved quite ineffectual, and afforded me no relief whatever.
I took no less than seven bottles of eucalyptus, and
even chlorodyne was prescribed for me. I fell away
lamentably, perspired profusely, and could not obtain
any sleep. I was in such pain that I could not
shift in bed. My right side was much the worst, and my
breathing was most labored and painful. T cannot be. too

Culpepper’s Brother-In-Law.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fight had been hot amongst the tobacco on
the hill-side, but the Dutchmen had been heavib
out-numbered, and, for every long-haired Sat
chanese that lay bulleted or bayoneted, half-a
dozen white jackets were stretched motionless anr
bloody.
So near to the man in hiding had one flaxen-
moustached young Hollander fallen that Cul-
pepper, as he crouched, could have touched the
horribly unseeing eyes that seemed to stare at him
between the tobacco-stems. Once he did stretch
out his hand, but the instant buzz of the blood-
flies made him snatch it hastily back—striking
wildly at such of the sickening things as came his
way.
“ Looks almost as if the poor devil was askin
me what business I have here. And, as for the
livin’ Dutchmen, if they should happen along to
bury dead or such like, it’s very likely they’d just
put a bayonet through me without askin’ me that
or any other question. So dear’s the word—now
it’s getting a bit duskish.”
Culpepper called himself a medical botanist,
but the Dutch authorities —suspecting that the
mineral kingdom was more the object of his atten-
tion than the vegetable—had refused him permis-
sion to leave Samarang, except by sea. By sea
he had left —but it was alone and by night—and
now, on the frontier of the unsubdued Satchan
country, he was disgusted to find himself, one
evening, in the very centre of a fight between the
fierce aboriginals thereof and the Dutchmen he
had come so far to avoid. From the sheltering
tobacco he had looked on at as much of a desperate
half-hour’s engagement as the broad leaves would
allow him to see—coolly ready all the time to pot
the first man—white or yellow—who should happen
across him in his concealment.
“ A crack, more or less, wouldn’t have been
noticed, and I may have to blow a hole through
somebody yet before I get to the boat. And,
Jericho ! —here he comes ! —or is it a she ?”
« * » *
The sun was down, and the goblin-like halungs
were flapping past towards the mango-groves
around the village, but there was light enough to
make, out that it was a Satchanese girl who came
creeping into the tobacco within a couple of rows
of him, and Culpepper remained still as stone
until, with scarcely a rustle, she had glided ghost-
like away in the direction he had come.
“ Now, what in thunder’s she after?” he mut-
tered, and then speedily answered his own ques-
tion according to his lights. “ Plunder ! The hilts
of some of them krisses has emeralds in ’em, I’ll
bet—and diamonds ! And that ought to’ve been
■your contract, Silas Culpepper.”
He turned, and crept back to where the fire-flies
were already casting here and there a swift gleam
upon the white jackets of the fallen Hollanders.
His ear told him where the girl was—talking
gently, as it seemed, to someone. But the
someone as Culpepper saw when, silently as a
snake, he had stolen near enough—was a
corpse; and he almost sighed as he told him-
self that the “ wiinming, poor critters!”
were the same under every skin. Which con-
cession to sentiment, however, was followed
immediately by a very practical disgust with such
a check upon his business operations.
“ I’ll see what this chap’s got, in the meantime,
anyhow ! ” and, stretching a cautious hand to the
body nearest him, Culpepper began to work th
kris out of what ought to have been the stiffenec
grasp. But it wasn’t —and hardly had th
warmth of the hand telegraphed to Culpepper’
brain that the man was still alive, before the
Javanese, with a long-drawn groan, turned ove
from his back to his side. The girl sprang
instantly up, came over, and peered so intent!;
down at the wounded man’s face that she saw no
more of the crouching figure within a yard of her
than she did of the other form that now made
suddenly a dim appearance behind her. Then—
but let Culpepper here take up his own story.
* • • *
“ When she turned and caught sight of the chap
that had just made one of the company, she didn’
screech—like a white woman would—but she gave
a jump like a kangaroo, an’ would have beer
mighty scarce in them parts if the fellow hadn’
been as quick as herself. But he has her by the
wrists like winkin’, and sticks to her like wax til
she stops squirmin’—which she does all of
sudden, and says somethin’ to him that don’i
appear to stroke him overmuch the right way, for
he lets go one of her wrists and whips out his kris
And then—l couldn’t see very well—but, after
she’d rubbed in something more that made him
twist her to the ground, I thought I saw him
drawin’ back his sticker to settle her, and I makes
a jump and lands him on the noddle with my
revolver-butt.
“Well, the girj, of course, got an almighty
scare, but she just dropped to things like the rea]
brainy critter she has since panned out, and she
flies round and gathers me half-a-dozen bandaras
from the stiff-’uns, and helps me to fix my man up
as tight as cement—not forgettin’ to get one of
the sashes over his ugly mouth. At least”—
Culpepper began reflectively to fill his pipe—“ I
suppose it was ugly, for I never saw the gentle-
man in daylight till—this morning ! ”
I looked round for my fishing-line. “This
morning ? You’ve seen nobody this morning but
myself and old Gojur, there ! ”
Culpepper sniggered as he struck a light.
Didn’t you notice—cuss the matches !—didn’t
you see me squintin’ mighty hard down into the
water when we were abreast of that rock with the
two holes through it ? No ? Well, as we come
back, I’ll show you what I was lookin’ at. Be-
cause it was behind that patch of mangroves at
the bend of the creek that my boat was hidden,
the night I’m yarnin’ about. And I may as well
tell you, before I go any furder, that the fellow
the girl was pipin’ her eye over was her sweet-
heart, with his head caved-in by a musket-butt.”
“ And the other? ”
“ Her brother ! Dead agen the match, he was ;
and when he came sneakin’ out in the dark after
her, she taunted him with keepin’ out of the way
while the fightin’ was on hand. And, of course,
though I couldn’t understand their lingo, I wasn’t
goin’ to let him stick the poor girl like a pig ! ”
{( “Come, now, my ingenious friend!’’ I said,
it hasn t been half a bad yarn, but you’ve
knocked a big hole in it now ! If you didn t
understand a word of what they said—how do you
know all this?”
“How? Why, Mrs. Culpepper told me after-
wards ! Kinder breaks you up, that, I reckon !
so don’t you ask any more fool’s questions till I’m
through, which won’t be long ; for the fact is the
girl made me understand—talk or no talk—that
’twould be a heap safer for her to skedaddle with
me, and safer for both of us if we toted the pris’ner
along, likewise. Which we did. Between us we
lugged him down that hill in front of you, anc
dumped him into the boat not a hundred yard
from where we’re sittin’ in this one. This Satchan
country’s quiet enough now, but I never though
to set eyes on the darned place again. Now, put
her about, and we’ll run back to the rock with the
holes in it.”
* « * *
A light began to come to me. Hadn’t I hearc
from somebody that Mrs. “ Dr. ” Culpepper was a
Java-woman? “ May I ask, Culpepper,” I said,
as the boat’s head came round, “if the lady ol
the skull-cracked knight found a consolatory sub-
stitute in ”
“Inme? That’s so, mister —she’s the present
Mrs. Culpepper. Sort of wife that don’t grow on
every bush neither —I tell you, sirree ! ”
“No doubt. But I shouldn’t have thought that
brother of hers would have made a first-class
brand of relation ! ”
“Him?” The old villain sucked in his lean
cheeks, as his way was when immensely tickled.
“ Well, now, mister, you see, he didn’t give the
thing a square trial. How in natur’ he worked
himself loose, I dunno; but some of these
Javanese chaps could give pints to the Daven-
ports ; and, at all events, just when we were pretty
well where we are now, up he jumps and lays me
out with a lump of the stone-ballast. It was ”
Culpepper reminiscently fingered his shaggy occi-
put—-“it was a knock that stiffened me for ten
minutes, but when I came-to my yaller friend
was a heap stiffer. She had brought half-a-dozen
of the krisses with her, you see, and she let him
have one of ’em for all she was worth ! Twenty
holes there was in that chap’s carcase, if there was
one ! ”
“ Made by his sister ? ” I exclaimed—feeling
that, upon the whole, the commonplace white article
had its advantages.
“ Bet your boots !” Culpepper steered close to
the rock with the holes in it. “ And, as ’twouldn’t
have done to let him go floatin’ around, tollin’
tales, I just wound a couple of fathoms of chain
round him and dropped him overboard—here ! ”
He lowered away the sail and, as the boat lost
her way, peered over the side for half-a-minute
before he beckoned to me. “ There you are !” he
said —“ nearly plumb beneath us.”
* » » *
I looked steadily down through what —being
apparently a three-fathom depth—was probably,
therefore, about five. A couple of yards to one
side of us, the shadow of the boat lay like a silver-
margined cloud upon the bottom, but, immediately
below —in knobs, and branches, and bowl-like
whorls—the coral gleamed white, and red, and
green ; with sponges, here and there, of blue, and
brown, and yellow ; while in and out amongst the
gorgeous, flower-like stuff played brilliant, tiny
fishes—stumpy, emerald-backed fellows with wide
rainbow-banded fins, and slender, shining, cylin-
drical creatures that looked like gold pencil-cases
endowed with lightning swiftness. And presently
—distinct against a dark red patch of moss-coral—
I made out the remnant of a human skeleton. The
skull was there, with the spine and ribs and pel-
vis, plainly recognisable through that perfectly
pellucid medium, and endowed by the shimmer of
the sun-pierced water with a fantastic semblance
of motion.
“You see him, do you? ”
“ I see it! ”
“ Never mind the word ! ” Culpepper cackled
sardonically as he ran the sail up again. “That’s
my brother-in-law, anyhow ! ”

As the siren-song of old lured the Greek to death! v
fold
So it lures to-day the brawny and the bold.
Where the gorge is dark that cleaves the Guinea
hills,
Where the swelt’ring swamp her fever-dew distils,
Scooping grave-pits in the mould
Soft he sings “ 0 Hearts a-cold / ”
The merry Ohoul that guards the Guinea Gold.
For he loves to see the merry pick a-swing,
Loves to hear the cradle reck, the axes ring,
But he better loves to spread nightly board and
nightly bed , . •
Where the delvers droop—the dying o’er the dead.
And he draws them with the magic of his song,
Our bravest and our best in eager throng,
Maid and wife may mourn and weep, but their
tryst our lads will keep
With the voice that calls them northward o’er
the deep !
Where the gorge is dark that cleaves the Guinea
hills,
Where the swelt’ring swamp her fever-dew distils,
Scooping grave-pits in the mould •
Soft he sings “ O Hearts a-coldl ”
The merry Ghoul that guards the Guinea Gold.
N.Q.
P. LUFTIG
A native dog has been killed down Bom-
bala, N.S.W., way, the skin of which, when
pegged out, measured 6ft. 6in. from nose-tip to
tail-tip.
“ Politician Gillies said nothing, excepting
a fair number of words, at the St. George’s Club
dinner,” writes The Bulletin’s London corre-
spondent, “although much was expected of him
by those who knew not the individual. You will
see sometimes at the Zoo a stumpy iguana in a
state of loosely-motionless torpidity. Gin-trap
jaws suggest viciousness if interfered with, and,
doubtless, many an audacious fly is ‘ taken in ’ by
the beast’s apparent stupor. The slop-made, six-
sizes-too-large skin hangs in dry, dull crinkles and
folds around the barely-breathing body. The bald
eyelids droop o’er the expressionless eyes, and a
cold, gritty atmosphere envelopes the abbreviated
length of negative passivity. You turn away to
moisten your orbs with something fresh and green
and lifelike. The reptile disappears, leaving an
impression of waviness on the sands of its glass-
house and one of its lazy worthlessness in the
mind of the observer. Cold-blooded, heartless,
useless, it departs, having done nothing and not
even done that well. Ugh ! Let Victoria send a
human politician with human feelings, life, and
energy.”
