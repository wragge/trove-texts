Know what made the-limousine of 1909 the jalopy of today?
One thing, competition.
The manufacturer who does not improve his product or
service to the public to keep ahead'of his competitors, fails.
Competition is the driving force that is the spur to progress.
In Australia there are many banks, each in competition for
your business, with the result that Australia has a banking
service equal to the best in the world.

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
THE USTASHI
Sir,
The attitude of the Commonwealth
Government towards the current Ustashi
terrorism is similar to that of a football
referee who after turning a blind eye
to the actions of an extremely vicious
player suddenly turns around and gives
jail the players a tongue lashing, but still
leaves the prime offender on the field.
Over two years ago I made lengthy
submissions to the NSW Premier based
upon the concern of moderate Sydney
Yugoslavs who were concerned at the
rising arrogance of this minority Croatian
group who sought to intimidate those
who rejected their totalitarian views.
Unfortunately, subsequent events have
confirmed their opinion that only prompt
Federal action could effectively curb
this growing lawlessness.
At the instigation of the Premier
senior officers of the NSW Police Force
have worked strenuously and with a high
s|nse; of. fairplay to harmonise these dis-
cordant groups within the Yugoslav com-
munity. . Unfortunately, however, due to
the lack of effective co-ope'ration by the
Commonwealth Security Services their
efforts have not achieved the results they
deserve.
In simple language, party politics is
dominating the Security Service in that
radical Yugoslavs are labelled potential
Communists, whilst those who use the
term “anti-Communist” as a thin veneer
over their neo - Fascist attitude are
allowed to go their ways in peace. This
oan be confirmed in the failure of the
Immigration Minister to give a detailed
analysis of deferred and rejected naturali-
sation applications.
Another instance is the failure of the
\MG to curb the activities of ultra-
r,ghtist Croatian Journal “Sprenmost”,
whose columns abound with anti-
assimilation philosophy.
In the early post-war years a Common-
wealth Labor Attorney - General took
effective action when CP Secretary
darkey uttered pro-Red Army senti-
nts-; Let the present Attorney-General
ake similar action against neo-Fascists.

ADONIS AND LOLITA
Sir,
When I was 13 and attending an
English girls’ boarding school so select
that we were not allowed even to play
tennis with boys from a nearby school,
I used to read “Venus and Adonis” as
pornography. I got the same pleasure
from “The Rape of Lucrece”, Marlowe’s
“Hero and Leander”, and later from
Chaucer’s “Troilus and Cressida”.
I can hardly say I was corrupted by
these poems, yet nothing I have read
since has made the same sensual impact
on me as “Venus and Adonis” did; cer-
tainly not “Lolita”, whose amorous pas-
sages are too ironic to be stimulating.
However, as disciples of Mr Rylah
know, it is never we ourselves who are
corrupted.

BLOCKADE
Sir,
Craster C. M. Usher (Commander,
RN, retired), as a negative and deplor-
able answer to Prof. J. D. Legge’s ques-
tion “What changes should be made in
Australia’s policy towards Indonesia?”,
put forward a suggestion that the navies
of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and
Malaysia should blockade Java
(9/5/64). Such a blockade would result
in the fragmentation of the Indonesian
empire, with Sumatra joining Malaysia
and the end of President Soekarno's rule,
according to Commander Usher.
Indonesia did experience this kind of
blockade, to a certain extent, in 1958
during the short-lived PRRI (Revolu-
tionary Republic of Indonesia) rebel-
lion. At that time a part of a big fleet
of a certain nation lay ready at Singa-
pore to interfere under the pretence of
safeguarding her interests. Foreign mer-
cenaries joined the air force of the rebels
in the northern part of Central Indo-
nesia, making raid after raid with the
aim of crippling the Indonesian Air
Force, and Indonesia’s security was also
threatened along the eastern borders.
The result? The rebellion was quelled,
without any outside help, within a short
period and Indonesia appeared more
united than ever in its determination to
fight for its unity and national existence!
Commander Usher accused Indonesia
of “gangsterism” and “banditry”. What
a pity that he considers Indonesia’s
policy the same as the present aggression
in Yemen (which is already condemned
by the United Nations) and the cruel and
merciless exploitation by colonial and
neo-colonial nations now and in the past!
ALEXANDER MARENTEK
Secretary for Press and
Public Relations
Embassy of Indonesia ,
Canberra (ACT).
Sir,
There are two points to be made on
the suggestion of Commander Usher
that Australia should work for the frag-
mentation of Indonesia.
(1) It is impracticable. There are,
indeed, strong tensions between Djakarta
and the outlying islands of Indonesia,
and between the Javanese and other
peoples of the country, but these are
more than offset by the cementing
centripetal factors, as is clear from the
history of the Sumatra-Celebes rebellion
of 1957-58.
Djakarta and the Javanese have im-
portant “natural allies” in the outer
islands. The ethnic pattern of these
islands is a patchwork quilt, and there
are numerous groups like the Karo'
Bataks of North Sumatra and the Dyaks
of Borneo which are more hostile to
their more emancipated neighbors (in
these cases the potentially anti-Djakarta
Toba Bataks and Bandjarese) than they
are to the men from the capital.
In addition Djakarta can expect sup-
port against a hypothetical new regional-
ist movement from the various groups
of Javanese settlers in the outer islands
and the predominantly Communist-in-
fluenced communities of estate workers
in these islands. Conversely, the aggrieved i
and potentially regionalist groups outside
Java can readily find allies on the island
of Java itself, particularly among the
strongly Islamic Sundanese of West Java,
a fact which disposes them to work to-
wards increasing their power in Djakart;
rather than attempting to promote the 1
secession of their own areas.
Since the 1958 rebellion the general
staff of the army in Djakarta has suc-
ceeded in establishing a markedly greater
degree of control over its regional com-
mands, as is clear from the ease witt (
which it has been able to transfer dif-
ficult commanders. And these years ban
also seen a major growth in the country;
navy and air force; both services are
strongly disposed to side with the central
authorities against would-be rebels it
the regions. ■ ■
In addition, the present generation bar
been nurtured in all-Indonesia national-
ism by inter-ethnic educational mixina
and inter-ethnic marriages.
(2) It is undesirable. If Indonesia
were to become fragmented there is w
likelihood at all that it would be a >
“clean break”. On the contrary, i
would almost certainly mark the begin-
ning of a period of civil war, a civil war
in which each rival power centre would
claim to speak for all of Indonesia anC
of which there would probably be n f
settlement until one side had imposed®
will on the others.
Moreover, with the restraints of tw
more strongly Islamic outer islands re-
moved, Java could well come und? l
Communist rule. This brings into view
the possibility of a Communist govern-
ment in Djakarta, as the govern men
with the most convincing claim to
the legitimate government of
asking for help from Russia and Chin
to frustrate “imperialist intervention ■
This surely would be a far worse situ
tion to have on our doorstep than w 1
we have now.

RETARDED CHILDREN
Sir,
My letter about Maurice Benn's case
(25/4/64) was written before his sen-
tence was commuted to 10 years. Still
a savage punishment but, after all, better
than death.
N. J. Hannan's sentiments about re-
tarded children (16/5/64) do him (or
her?) great credit. His unwarranted
assumptions about my right to speak
about these children are less charitable.
I have worked with retarded children
(many more than two) because I have
boundless admiration for most of the
parents of such children that I have met,
and a desire to be of help. I do know
the rewarding response that can be re-
ceived from less desperately afflicted
children. I am not talking about child-
ren who can be taught to do up buttons
and tie knots. I am referring to child-
ren whose only co-operative response to
the outside world may be to open their
mouths for food. It is simply unrealistic
and ignorant nonsense to talk of their
“kindness, generosity and gentleness”.
Nor am I saying “the answer is to kill
them off”. Surely it is more civilised
to take mitigating circumstances into
account when passing sentence than to
demand an eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth.
ANN GRUEN
Harkaway (Vic.).
Sir,
At risk of being considered uncivilised
by Mr J. N. Hannan (16/5/64) I must
protest against his ill-considered attack
on Ann Gruen, whose letter on the Benn
trial and sentence succinctly expressed
what, I am sure, many people have felt
but have been too dishonest to publicly
express. Ann Gruen took great care to
differentiate between the various types
of retarded children, and expressly speci-
fied the type of abnormality which ren-
ders a child less than a savage animal.
It takes little imagination to picture what
misery such a child experiences—its
violence expresses it.
The retarded child Mr Hannan speaks
of is a totally different type, capable of
showing affection and, no doubt, quite
lovable; Mr Hannan would feel tremen-
dous reward when that first button is
conquered. But I wonder how he would
feel if all his efforts, all the love he had
given his daughter, had been rewarded
not by the conquering of that button,
but by extreme violence, no recognition
and a heartbreaking hatred.
You must read a letter properly, and
less emotionally, Mr Hannan, before
you attack its writer.

When talking of industry, there can be no question about it —’the Railways of Australia are outstandingly
the biggest. Collectively, they represent a capital investment of £782 million. As the nation’s biggest
employer, they directly give employment to 131,000 men and women; indirectly, they give employment to
scores of thousands more—from those who build their locomotives to those who supply carpets for the floors
of their air-conditioned trains.
How big is biggest? The Railways of Australia operate 2,952 locomotives, 7,127 passenger vehicles and
96,186 goods wagons over 25,500 miles of track. Last year, the Railways of Australia had a turnover of
£209 million; paid out nearly £146 million in salaries and wages; bought goods and materials to the
value of £6O million.
Last year, the trains of the Railways of Australia ran 96 million miles (a distance to beyond the sun),
carried 465 million passengers and moved 56 million tons of freight in a never-ending collection and
distribution of the nation’s wealth. Railway support means more jobs for more Australians to work
towards the ideal of a more progressive, more prosperous Australia.

When you choose industrial rubber products durability
is of prime importance. Illustrated are seven striking
examples of the lasting qualities of Goodyear products.
But that is only part of the story. The
choice of a Goodyear product may
begin with many other aspects of its
use: extreme temperature conditions;
the need to withstand prolonged ex-
posure to weather; an unusual use
calling for a special design.
Goodyear meets such demands with
unrivalled world-wide experience in
industrial rubber. It comes to you
through the G.T.M. (Goodyear Tech-
nical Man). He is trained to give you
immediate, expert advice on any pro-
blem, and he is as near as your tele-
phone. When you need the answer to
a question about rubber, call him, or
write to the Goodyear branch in your
State.

National Notebook
Blue Streak
Woomera rocket range has had a
" unique and unenviable reputation
among newsmen for extraordinary and
unnecessary security precautions. A
Briton wrote that Woomera was note-
worthy for its obsolescent weapons, mar-
supials, and security men, and that the
security men outnumbered the marsu-
pials. This comment is unkind, but the
fact is that “security” has, in the past,
throttled some spectacular technological
achievements up there in the donga.
And the fact is that a shrewd defence
reporter in Whitehall can find out with
accuracy pretty well any of the perfor-
mance data of such weapons as Blood-
hound and Blue Streak by buying a drink
for a contact in the Ministry of Defence
at the Red Lion.
Our cover story this week —and “Pro-
ject ’64’s” remarkable documentary on
Blue Streak, due to be programmed on
Channel 9 on May 25—is by Anthony
Cave Brown, a British reporter here on
a series of assignments for a London
newspaper.
Brown went to Woomera with Robert
Raymond, executive producer of tele-
vision’s “Project ’64”.
Peter Leyden was camera-
man, and John Oakley,
soundman.
The quartet arrived at
Woomera, to be greeted
by Mr Dick Carter of
Security and a full-scale
conference. Mr “Horrie” Higgs, the
range director, laid on an RAAF Otter
light aircraft and an Alouette helicopter
for aerial work; a Minibus was available
a t all hours to transport the quartet and
their equipment, and the security men
kept noticeably clear. For a week, with
Mr Carter acting in no more an official
position than a helpful guide and
chauffeur, the TV group prowled around
1 e ran ge and were permitted to photo-
§raph the operation in such detail that

judiced. The only piece of bumbledom
encountered was one photographic nega-
tive. The top right-hand corner had

Comeback
Tn the audience watching Fonteyn and
A Nureyev nearly every night of their
season, thinking of the good old days,
was Elaine Fifield, once potentially
Australia’s greatest ballerina and now,
after seven years, attempting a come-
back.
For the young dancer who turned
down a London offer of over £12,000
in order to marry, it is an anxious period
and a frustrating one. She has spent five
years in New Guinea, had
two children, and trained,
she told us, “for no more
than ten months of that
time”. Now she is back,
not yet a member of the
company, but dancing in
rehearsal with Peggy van
Praagh’s Australian Ballet Company,
and preparing for the most critical time
of her career. Whatever uncertainty she
may feel, it doesn’t show. She has
found that her limbs have stiffened up
hardly at all, and what she has for-
gotten is more mental than physical.
“I have passed the point,” she said,
“where I can give up again.”
But how does it feel to be re-learning
the things she once did better than most
other dancers? How does it feel to watch
Margot Fonteyn, whom she admires so
much, and wonder whether she herself
might today have been so acclaimed but
for her retirement? How does it feel
to return, at 33, with a reputation that
has gathered seven years’ dust, to a new
young company still feeling its way? Miss
Fifield isn’t sure. Her relationship with
the present company seems somehow
uneasy, although she is full of praise
for them and they admire and respect
her. But a comeback is an all or nothing
thing, and you get the feeling that a
local success will not be enough, despite
her protestations to the contrary. She
seems at the moment to be merely

seem to sense it. Where is she going?
It could be to new successes and the
Royal Ballet, as Fonteyn is confident it
can be, but then again it could be to
nostalgic recognition, and the suburbs.
Literary Award
Qydney writer Hugh Atkinson has won
the Xavier award of £5OO for his
novel, “The Rabbit”, which will be pub-
lished in London later this year by
Bodley Head.
This award, which is hedged about
with refreshingly few conditions, comes
from the Xavier Society, a group of
Brisbane Catholic laymen. The group
works mainly for charity, has a monthly
luncheon and an annual concert, but, it
seems, a wider range of interests than
most similar bodies. It first offered £5OO
in 1962 but when the contest did not,
in the opinion of the judges, .yield a
sufficiently good piece of literature, the
society gave £lOO each to three entrants.
Forever Petruchio
T ocal productions to celebrate the
Shakespearian 400th anniversary
have just about exhausted possible plays
so the Sydney Teachers’ College is doing
“Kiss Me Kate” at the College in August.
The cast was thrilled when the
Petruchio of the film version, Howard
Keel, visited them in rehearsal at the
invitation of the producer, Bill Collins.
Keel, who was here for nightclub appear-
ances, was on stage with the cast for
more than an hour. He went through a
scene with Philomena Brant, the show’s
Kate, and discussed details of production.
“Kiss Me Kate” is almost a life’s work
with Keel. He finished a TV version in
Britain before coming to Australia and
goes back to America for further stage
appearances in it.

PLAIN ENGLISH
New Look at New Guinea
TWO encouraging developments
A took place last week the
enactment of the Northern Terri-
tory’s Aborigines Rights Bill and
the formation of the Council on
New Guinea Affairs. The Abori-
gines Rights Bill was long over-
due and has been passed in re-
sponse to a growing Australian
awareness that we have a color
problem, an awareness which has
been lamentably slow and as much
in response to external political
pressures as to an awakening
national conscience. The passage of
the Bill does not automatically solve
the many problems of the Abori-
gines or make relations between
Aborigines and whites automatically
better, saner or kinder. But it is a
first step.
The formation of the Council on
New Guinea Affairs is another sign
of Australia’s growing sophistication
about matters very near to her.
There are many ways of looking at
East New Guinea, the most popular
one in Australia being a com-
placent, although understandable,
belief that in the discharge of our
Trusteeship in the Territory we
have done a resounding job and
there is no need to worry about
anything—everything will turn out
all right.
Will it? No matter how good a
job we do there will be uncomfort-
able problems and no easy solu-
tions. What happens to New
Guinea? What sort of relationship
will it adopt with us after self-
determination? How much money
should be spent on it? What sort of
political parties will arise? What is
its relationship with West New
Guinea and Asian States to be?
Could it, even at this stage, become
Australia’s seventh State? And
would this be wise in view of its
neighbor? How big a role can
private enterprise play in what is
necessarily a socialistic, government
venture? The questions are endless
and subjects for informed specula-
tion.
The Council on New Guinea
Affairs which is to receive govern-
ment and private financial support is
a non-political body which will seek
to promote the collection and widest
dissemination of informed, rational
opinions on New Guinea through
seminars, conferences and a journal.
Not least of its endeavors will be
to bring New Guineans who are
leaders in political, cultural and
social fields to the mainland to meet
Australian leaders in comparable
fields. The Council, a modest replica
of Chatham House or New York’s
Council on Foreign Affairs, can play
a unique and constructive role in
yet another of Australia’s widening
horizons.
Asking for More
/ANE would have been willing to
take the latest State Aid con-
troversy a little more seriously a
little sooner, had it not been
launched by that well-known comic
paper, the so-called “Anglican” of
Sydney which is regularly dis-
owned by Sydney Anglican leaders.
The Anglican Archbishop of Syd-
ney, Dr Gough, immediately an-
nounced that he had in fact set up
an advisory committee to decide
on how best to spend the Common-
wealth’s contributions; and that,
one assumed, settled that.
But soon afterwards the NSW
Presbyterian Assembly recom-
mended that NSW Presbyterian
schools reject the aid, and some
Methodists are now reported to be
thinking along similar lines.
It is clear that some, at least, of
the Presbyterian schools will reject
the Assembly’s advice and one can
only hope that they all will. The
facts are plain: that schools and
science facilities are going to be-
come costlier and costlier to run,
that Australian schools are badly
equipped in the science depart-
ments, that private moneys, while
essential, cannot meet all the needs
of private schools, that Govern-
ment investment in education is, by
international standards, very in-
adequate, and, finally, that the
Federal Government has at long last
agreed to do something about it.
To turn one’s back on this is to
turn one’s back on educational pro-
gress. Rather than scorning Govern-
ment money, one should ask for
more.
The ABC of Dr Mackay
THE ABC is always fair game, and
A many of the criticisms levelled
at it ranging from Right-wing
timidity to Leftist prejudice often
have some element of truth in them.
(The day someone manages plaus-
ibly to accuse it, or one of its
speakers, of expressing Rightist pre-
judices will really be one for the
books. But Dr M. Mackay’s
attack on the ABC in the Federal
Parliament last week was pathetic
indeed.
What had happened was that Dr
Mackay was asked to join in a dis-
cussion of migration policy with
Senator Cohen on the “Four Corn-
ers” programme. He agreed. He
then confronted the Senator, who
completely outwitted and outman-
oeuvred him in debate despite
the fact that the Senator had a very
weak case.
So Dr Mackay proceeds to weep
on the shoulder of Parliament
about ABC Leftist bias. This is too
much, even for those of us who often
criticise the ABC. If Dr Mackay
had done his homework and pre-
pared good arguments to refute
Senator Cohen’s sophistries there
would have been no occasion for
complaint. The ABC gave him
time; it was up to him to use it
well.


THIS AUSTRALIA
STOCK EXCHANGE
The Casino
in Little Collins St
Lessons from Swallow and Ariell
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
SIR IAN POTTER
In battle
T ast week’s prolonged aftermath of the
recent unedifying free-for-all on the
Melbourne Stock Exchange, which
resulted in the Australian Biscuit Com-
pany getting a majority interest in
Swallow and Ariell Ltd (see The
Bulletin, May 14, 1964) did, if any-
thing, shock more people than the bidding
battle between rival brokers, Were’s and
Potter's itself. For when the main
contest was over it was expected that
the Australian Biscuit Company would
quickly make an offer for the outstand-
ing shares; instead, it waited eleven days
until May 18 before making a firm
announcement and in the interval
brokers and speculators continued their
Roman holiday.
Speculators, some of whom had sold
Swallows short at up to 81s. before
Were’s and Potter’s folded their tents on
May 8, were given the chance, by the
non-suspension of dealings in the shares,
to buy back as low as 525., two trading
days later, making a profit of up to
295. a share on their gambles, while
some bona fide shareholders, uncom-
fortable at the absence of a decision by
the ABC, parted with their shares at
well under the company’s ultimate bid
of 70s. Thanks to the unrestricted
trading since the time of the first offer
(of 405.) for the shares on April 4,
speculators who bought then and held
on had a six weeks run for their money,
for 75 p.c. profit.
Apart from Nabisco (which is also
to get 70s. apiece for the shares still
held after the battle and is said to
have made a capital profit of £70,000
for its bidding pains), those to reap the
easiest harvest were brokers and this
continued to come in—if not on such a
generous scale—all the time the ABC
was delaying fixing its final offer. In
the six weeks following the Nabisco’s
first offer on April 4, 425,000 of
Swallow’s £1 ordinaries, preference shares
and notes changed hands on Melbourne
’Change and this included more than
80 p.c. of the company’s ordinary
capital. Taking an average traded price
of 70s. a share (which is probably con-
servative because a high proportion of
deals were in the most intensive trading
days from May 6 to 8 when prices
ranged from 68s. to 81s), brokers would
have collected more than £20,000 in
commissions.
Should such windfalls be permitted to
flow from takeovers? Should speculators,
including brokers who are on the spot
to take advantage of swings in prices on
the floor of ’Change, be given a free
hand to turn the Stock Exchange into
a casino as big financial interests vie
with each other for industrial prizes?
Isn’t it about time the stock exchanges
themselves made more use of their
prerogative to suspend trading in shares,
particularly those subject to takeover
offers? There are precedents for the
latter, such as the suspension in trading
in Adelaide Steamship shares while
H. C. Sleigh’s- unsuccessful bid for the
company was on in 1959.
Admittedly, the stock exchanges will
always be at the mercy of the un-
scrupulous insider with foreknowledge
of an impending offer who buys shares
in a takeover company before an offer
for it has been made public. But as soon
as an offer is made public the stock
exchanges are in the box seat to nip
speculative buying in the bud simply by
suspending dealings in the shares con-
cerned until the fate of the offer is
decided one way or another.
Brokers would naturally be against
it because takeover offers invariably
breed them handsome commissions, as
that for Swallow amply demonstrates.
This leaves action by the Government
as the most reasonable way to stop the
abuses.
MIGRANTS
Encouraging Private Armies?
Dr Cairns’s sense of duty
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
JQr J. Cairns, mhr, has now for a long
period been passionately attacking
the Ustashi, a Croatian organisation
which he asserts exists in Australia and
which he describes (Page 2199 of Han-
sard for May 20, 1964) as Fascist, as
guilty of genocide and political terror-
ism. If only a modicum of what Mr
Cairns says about Ustashi and its ad-
herents in Australia is correct, it is the
type of organisation which should be
exposed and have its activities ended in
this community.
But is Dr Cairns performing a public
duty when, in justifying the group op-
posed to the Ustashi the Yugoslav
Settlers’ Association —he takes an atti-
tude that could encourage this section
of the migrant population to form a pri-
vate army to protect themselves or take
action against the Ustashi group?
If you look at the purpose of the con-
ference, of which Dr Cairns was a spon-
sor, called by the Yugoslav Settlers’ Club
on March 6 of this year in Melbourne,
it is not to complain about the failure
or the inability of the police to provide
protection for Yugoslavs who were men-
aced by the Ustashi but to “discuss and
work out a plan for united action against
the Ustashi. In Dr Cairns’s own words
(page 2200 of Hansard, May 20, 1964)
the purpose of the conference was one
“of doing something to protect its mem-
bers and bringing information to the
attention of the Attorney-General and
anyone else who was prepared to investi-
gate it.”
After saying that the secretary of the
Yugoslav Settlers’ Club, Mr Jurjevic, a
former member of the British Navy, had
brought the Yugoslav Settlers’ Association
into existence on March 6 as a formal
and official body, he asked the question,
“Why did he do this?” In reply to his
own question, Dr Cairns said: “Because
Mr Jurjevic had had three ribs broken
by thugs of Ustashi in 1962, and in
November, 1962, three members of the
Ustashi broke into a social evening a
the Club and threw ether bombs in plastic
containers into the middle of a group 0


nien, women and children taking part
in that social evening. On New Year’s
Eve three different thugs of Ustashi did
the same thing. Then in February of
this year men broke into the Club at
night and did £5OO worth of damage
there. They wrote slogans on the walls
and on the property of the club, slogans
to which the Honorable Member for
Mackellar, Mr Wentworth, subscribes in
desiring to see set up in Yugoslavia a
Government which would now carry out
a programme of mass extermination if
it was successful in setting itself up
there.”
With all deference to Dr Cairns I
suggest that what he should be doing is
telling the Yugoslav settlers that their
reaction in setting up an organisation for
“the purpose of doing something to
protect members” and “to work out
a plan for united action against the
Ustashi” is not in the democratic
Australian tradition, and that in such
circumstances they should rather call
the police.
The attack has been against the
Utashi and the Commonwealth, despite
the fact that, outside its own Territories,
the Commonwealth is not responsible for
the maintenance of law and order.

no-r urner described the American
tst James Baldwin as “an unwilling
tribune of his people”. “Another
Country” was a novel showing the tra-
gedy of the Negro situation, conceived
in terms of sexuality.
Mrs Ruskin is a mother of four who
combines housekeeping with an active
career in journalism. She considered
“Lolita” as a genuine love story, despite
the hero’s unpleasant form of sexual
deviation.
Mr Murray-Smith then made history
by being the first speaker to use the
famous four-letter Lady Chatterley word
at a mixed public meeting in the Mel-
bourne Town Hall. It came through
loud and clear, but there was no notice-
able shock or any other reaction from
the audience. Mr Murray-Smith did not
consider “Lady Chatterley” to be Law-
rence’s best novel, but its literary merit
was considerable.
Mr Jones, while he did not repeat
the four-letter word, quoted extracts
from the cross-examination at the Lady
Chatterley Trial which would not be
allowed into print in any Australian
publication. He pointed out that while
the four novels discussed by the pre-
vious speakers had struck trouble in
various other countries, the ban on “The
Trial of Lady Chatterley” seemed pecu-
liar to Australia. It had been banned,
said Mr Jones, not for pornography, but
because it was subversive of censorship
in general.
With five dissentients, the meeting
carried a resolution condemning the pre-
sent censorship system. Speakers
answered several questions, including the
inevitable one “Do you favor any cen-
sorship at all?” The most definite
answers came from Mrs Ruskin and
Mr Murray-Smith who would seriously
consider banning works written on a
popular level with the aim of fomenting
racial hatred.
UNIONS
Trade Unions v.
Victorian ALP
The Left wing is moulting
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
f|%E election of Mr Ken Stone as
Assistant - Secretary of the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council last week
was another narrow, but bitter defeat
for the Left-wing unions and Mr Jack
Wood, their candidate. It also marked
the end, at least for a time, of the
jockeying, intrigue and whispering which
has gone on ever since the death of the
former THC Secretary, Mr J. V. Stout,
in March.
The first trial of strength came in the
election for a new secretary to replace
Mr Stout. The Right wing backed the
then Assistant-Secretary, Mr. M. C.
Jordan, and the Left rallied behind Mr
Wood, who has a full-time paid position
as THC representative on the Supple-
mentary Workers’ Compensation Board.
Mr Jordan won by 13 votes in a big
poll.
Had Mr Wood been victorious he
would not only have had a more exacting
job, but he would have suffered a cut
in income. Surprisingly, after his defeat
for the Secretary’s job, he agreed to run
against Mr Stone for the lesser job, with
its salary of £3B 10s. a week plus car
and telephone. This victory would have
left Mr Wood a cool thousand pounds
a year worse off.
Although Mr Stone won by only nine
votes, the result was a clear indication
that the old Left-wing machine headed
by Mr Stout is in eclipse, at least in the
industrial sphere. The same is not true,
however, of the Executive of the Vic-
torian Branch of the ALP. The unions
affiliated to the THC include some
which are run by Communist officials,
some by DLP and some by ALP men
of a wide variety of attitudes. There
are also some unions which have no
formal affiliation with the ALP or any
other party. In short, the THC is
broadly representative of all the many
trends and attitudes in the Victorian
Labor movement.
The unions affiliated to the ALP are
not so numerous, nor so representative of
different shades of opinion. A few unions
(for example, the Clerks) prefer to be
affiliated to the DLP. Others (like the


Shop Assistants) let their ALP affiliation
lapse at the time of the 1955 split and
have not since linked up with either
party. While there are Right-wing unions
affiliated to the Victorian ALP, its roll
of unions is biased in a Left-wing direc-
tion when compared to the tally of
Trades Hall affiliates.
As a result of Mr Stone’s win, the
Right wing will have a 6-5 majority on
the Trades Hall Council executive. This
will not lead to any change in the Vic-
torian ALP Executive, though it may
cause some occasional friction between
the two bodies.
Mr Stone has been a full-time trade
union official for 13 years and was Assis-
tant Secretary of the Victorian branch
of the Printing Industry Employees’
Union. At 38, he is young for the new
job he holds. He is a popular figure in
the union movement and there was little
that the Left could allege against him,
except that he was not one of their men.
IN THE RED
Sharkey’s Last Weeks?
Aarons is hungry for the trimmings
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
rr»HE 20th triennial Congress of the
Communist Party of Australia, to be
held on the Queen’s Birthday weekend in
June, could well prove as historic as did
the Soviet Union’s 20th Congress in
1956 when Mr Khrushchev denounced
Stalin. Problems galore confront the
CPA, not the least being the question
of leadership. Laurie Aarons, with his
brother Eric, rules in all but name, and
titular leader L. Sharkey still vacillates
over stepping down gracefully in Aaron’s
favor. Should Sharkey in a fit of pique
decide to make a fight for it on the
Congress floor, Aarons would certainly
win, but the already split Party would be
further split.
Aarons can continue to follow the
path charted by Sharkey when, from
1939 to 1948, he led from the rear while
allowing J. B. Miles to retain the empty
title of secretary. But Aarons is hungry
for all the trimmings of power, and it
would be a bitter pill for him to have to
wait another three years for the title of
leader. Besides, another Ted Hill might
turn up!
The heavy decline in membership
must also be explained to Congress. In
attempting to give the impression of a
larger membership than is the case, the
Secretariat has set the basis of rep-
resentation as one delegate for each 40
members instead of the previous one for
fifty. Even with this device any delegate
who cares to subtract from the overall
attendance the number of Central Com-
mittee members (about 42) who attend
as'delegates without being elected and
the usual number of select visitors, will
have a job to stretch the estimates of
membership beyond 4000 (the lowest
since the Party’s period of illegality).
Party finance is under keen discussion.
This is partly the result of the article in
The Bulletin (January 25) on how
the Party spent about £250,000 in 1963,
including £52,000 on new headquarters
in Sydney, raising the question: where
does the money come from? A feeble
reply to The Bulletin in “Tribune”
only served to cause further doubts
among members. In an attempt to
balance expenditure with income, figures,
are printed in “Tribune” of contributors,!
including one presumably mythical donor
(YARD) who is claimed to have donated
eight gifts of £lOO each within a space
of 16 weeks. As well as this, Party con-
ferences are reported as agreeing to pay
in 15s. per member per week. In 196(1
it was planned for each member to pay
approximately Bs. per week; this figure
was not achieved.
Probably the best indication of the
CPA’s waning strength was the pool
showing in the Sydney May Day march
—a yardstick by which the Party gauges
its organisational strength. Without the
bands and the marching girls there would
have been precious few marchers at al
The happiest man in the procession was
Ted Hill’s man in Sydney, Syd Clare,
striding along carrying and distributing
a large bundle of Hill’s newspaper
“Vanguard”.
Hovering over the Congress, in every-
one’s mind, will be Ted Hill. For al
the talk of “an insignificant splinter
group” it is now apparent that Hills
party, the CPA (Marxist-Leninist), grows
stronger. Its groups in the trade unions
increase and its publications multiply
It is obvious now that Hill is a top man
in a Chinese-led International, with the
emphasis on Asia, Africa and South
America. A new weekly publication
“New China News”, put out by the New
China Newsagency (Hsinhua) in M e '
bourne and edited by Hillite Duncan
Clarke, seems to be the Australasian
journal of this organisation.
Accompanied by Rick Oke (a Centraj
Committee member of his party) Hi
has had a longish visit to Red ChM
ostensibly to attend the May Day cee
brations, but also to confer with lea
of all the Chinese-oriented parties. '
conferred with Mao Tse-tung, Chou
lai and other top leaders.
Although not spoken of jf !js
CPA, these things are known.
not known is how many °t
adherents still remain in the CPA.
final dreaded unknown is how u ian y
these will be at the Congress in ’
and what will happen if a declara i
Hill is made from the floor.

IRANSPORT
The Mystery of the
Handsome Cabs
£42,000 a year profit for one taxi operator
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
W. WALSH
Tightening up
The clear profit of one owner of 32
ll cabs, the biggest open fleet, in Sydney
■ taking the most conservative estimate
if £25 a week profit from each cab—•
v'ould run into nearly £42,000 a year,
business that puts most one-man enter-
rises in Australia well into the shade,
he next biggest fleet owner would get
early £28,000 on the same conservative
stimate for his fleet of 22. These are
he sort of figures and potential profits
hat lie behind some of the row that has
een rumbling in Sydney over the past
;w weeks about the issue of 276 new
|ixi plate licences and the conditions
ttached.
The two big fleets mentioned are
fficially acknowledged by the Depart-
ment of Motor Transport and are made
’P largely of cab plates issued before
945 and which can be legitimately held
i large numbers by one man, because
fading these plates is allowed.
However, the most interesting question
’ the fate of the post-1945 cab plates—
me subject of an attempt by the State
Government recently to tighten up
rading. These should not officially have
dlen into the hands of fleet owners but
1 ould have been transferred, when sold,
,n| y 1° another owner-driver.
But it is common knowledge that
ar ge dccts of these cabs held in dummies’
lam es have been built up. Also on a
nia er sca G e the holding of two or three
; as b y °ne owner, who is not an active
riVer > is common.
The regulations promulgated by the
> ate Government for the new cab
’ ates, and then extended to cover all
c existing post-1945 plates, specify that
ae y can only be sold once. The Com-
i iss!° ner f° r Motor Transport, Mr
lam Walsh, has explained that the
' C . y ls designed to “ensure that licences
e Pt in the hands of persons who
Jn ! e the vehicles”.
Ir :J le f e^ ect °f the regulations on the
Svdn u an Unres tricted cab plate in
Ust ey bas yet to make itself clear.
k] 0 i year th e prices for plates went as
tnorw’ ur >der pressure of “funk-
lorn r ° m betting operators getting
I a anticipation of the coming of the
i ll ' c °urse tote.
It is one of the anomalies of the
situation that the Government’s move
designed to block the growing fleets and
keep the cabs tied to owner-drivers is
likely to, for a start, hurt .the class of
men it is trying to strengthen, the single
cab owner - driver. Over the years a
profitable business of financing the pur-
chase of cab plates has grown up.
The pressure of the growth of un-
official fleets helped to force up prices,
but still many drivers committed them-
selves to interest rates which make
ordinary hire-purchase companies look
like benevolent institutions, in order to
buy a cab and raise their status and
income.
Not only was that class of driver
committed to his payments off the plate,
but he also had to get a car and put
it on the road. Now, of course, his
investment for which he worked long
hours (and, of course, worked his relief
driver equally hard) has deteriorated
drastically in value.
While the Government move to stop
the further growth of the fleets is wise,
the fact that it will hurt “the little men”
is a reflection of the muddle that has
been the taxi policy in Sydney since the
end of the war.
The Government has also imposed the
condition that the applicants for the new
plates (204 unrestricted and the balance
for restricted suburban plates) should
be members of the Transport Workers’
Union.
This attempt to build up members Kip
of the union in the taxi industry comes
belatedly. Out of the 5000 drivers in
Sydney estimates vary from 200 to 1500
union members with the truth probably
somewhere in between.
While it is true that the taxi driver as
unqualified worker is probably getting
more than he would get in other un-
skilled occupations —at present some-
where between £25-£3O a week on the
average—he works six days a week and
about 72 hours to get it.
The Metropolitan Taxi Council has
worked out a form of agreement between
employer and driver allowing for 6d. in
the £ to be put aside towards holiday
period, but there is considerable dispute
on just how many of the drivers are
getting holidays.
The increase in the number of plates
comes after a consistent drum-beat of
complaints over the last few years that
there were too few taxi-cabs in Sydney,
probably the most taxi-minded city in
Australia. What the increase will do
is anyone's guess. But the calling of
applications for the new plates without
a searching inquiry into the working of
the industry is yet another case of the
half-measures that have been all too
typical of the Government’s attitude to-
wards the taxi business and the wider
problems of transport for as long as
most people in Sydney can remember.
EDUCATION
Sisyphus
Revisited?
A ring of Catholic schools
FROM MATHEW VAUGHAN IN SYDNEY
Tn the stream of statements from
A churches on State Aid that followed
the NSW Presbyterian Conference's
decision against the Federal Govern-
ment's science block subsidy, the silence
of the Roman Catholics was noticeable.
However, at the same time, it was stated
that reference would be made to the
question of State Aid in a Pastoral by
Cardinal Gilroy, due to be read in
Sydney churches next Sunday, May 3U
The coming Pastoral can say nothing
new on the science block aid “question”,
as far as Catholics are concerned. It
goes without saying that the aid will be
readily accepted.
But there are indications that the
Pastoral will in fact contain an announce-
ment of a sweeping programme of build-
ing to change the pattern of Catholic
secondary education in Sydney. For
months now rumours have been current
of this re-organisation.
What has emerged is that the Catholic
Church is planning for a vast secondary
school building programme with a ring
of ten new schools to cost between £5
million and £7 million.
If the Catholic Church launches on
this campaign it will certainly mean that
for some years to come the prospect of
direct State Aid from the State Govern-
ment in Macquarie Street has been
written off.
There are plenty of Catholics who are
prepared to say that the leaders of the
Church have been too concerned to wait
for the manna of State Aid, and too little
concerned to overhaul archaic financial
structures and face practically the chal-
lenge of a growing school population.

More carefree than a car’s ever been. The beauty of the new Falcon
extends far beyond its bold new look. Take maintenance, for instance.
Instead of the usual 10 or 12 service stops a year, the new Falcon
requires only a quick and easy visit to a Ford Dealer only twice a
year, or each 6,000 miles... because:
FX72O
It goes 36,000 miles between chassis
lubrications. Fuel filter and air cleaner
elements also last 36,000 miles under
normal operating conditions.
It adjusts its own brakes. No need to
have brakes mechanically adjusted for
the life of the linings.
It cleans its own oil. Falcon’s full-flow
oil filtering system allows 6,000 miles
between oil changes.
It protects its own body. All of Falcon’s
underbody is “dipped" to resist rust and
corrosion ... all vital underbody parts
are undercoated ... the muffler and
tailpipe aluminium coated to last far
longer.
It takes care of its own finish. New
“Diamond Lustre” baked enamel needs
only washing and a bi-annual light liquid
polish to maintain showroom condition.

comes it will present the leadership of
the Church in Sydney with a mammoth
task of fund-raising. What has often
been the case in Australian cities is that
older - established parishes, with their
schools already built, have done nothing
to share the burden laid on the newer
parishes in rapidly-expanding areas.
A reluctance to break with the old
forms of financing, strengthened by
vested interests of parishes and orders,
have contributed to what people are
starting to call “educational slums” in
some sectors of the Catholic school
system. In Sydney no attempt has been
made yet to raise funds from church
members by interest-paying loans, a
device which has been most successful
in Melbourne.
The question is whether the Cardinal’s
Pastoral, will mark any radical advance
or whether a recourse to the old time-
worn method of direct giving will signal
yet another direct burden for the laity.
LABOR
What Harry Bridges Can
Teach Australians
McMahon in California
FROM BRENDAN O'HARA IN SYDNEY
W. McMAHON
Off to California
This week Mr William McMahon, the
Minister for Labor, will be in Cali-
fornia discussing with labor and em-
ployer representatives the methods by
which the chaos on the San Francisco
waterfront has been cleared up—methods
which could well be adapted to Aus-
tralian conditions.
There are two main reasons for the
chaos on the Australian waterfront: the
first is the casual nature of the industry
itself; and the second is the way in which
the natural causes of friction are ex-
ploited, used, and manipulated by the
Communist leaders of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation. Both of these
factors operated in California—until
October, 1960.
In that month a radical new direction
Was taken, when the International Long-
shoremen's and Warehousemen’s Union
( LWU) and the Pacific Maritime Asso-
ciation (PMA) signed a five-and-a-half
War agreement, guaranteeing longshore-
against loss of jobs and of wages
, Ue to the increasing mechanisation of
e Waterfront, and in return giving the
employers or shipowners a guarantee
there would be no more purely
Political stoppages.
This is how it worked: The shipowners

Wa f longshoremen;
due' nance earl Y retirement thus re-
r?ri|ln^, Wor k force and offsetting
, Uced work opportunity;
Provide a retirement allowance at
w of £3500.
Guaranteed Weekly Wage: Like all
industries the problem of increasing
mechanisation greatly accelerated after
World War 11. This intensified the feel-
ing of daily economic and psychological
insecurity of the longshoremen. For in-
stance, in 1948 the Pacific coast ports
of the US were shut down for 95 days.
Under the agreement the shipowners
guaranteed to all regular longshoremen
a weekly wage equivalent to 35 hours of
work on ordinary time. This amounted
to £44. But this guaranteed wage only
operated when the work opportunity had
been reduced— and not when the tonnage
had declined due to any economic reces-
sion.
Early Retirement: Longshoremen with
over 25 years of service in the industry
can, if they choose, retire at 62 with a
monthly pension of £97 until they reach
65. When they turn 65 they then become
entitled to the normal industry pension
of £52 a month plus the £56 monthly
Social Security benefit. This is in
addition to pensioners’ full hospital and
medical benefit.
Retirement Payment : When retiring at
the age of 65 longshoremen can either
accept a lump sum of £3500 dr accept it
in monthly instalments.
How did the shipowners benefit?
First, they received the abolition of
certain work rules, i.e., rules by which
the longshoremen had insured themselves
against redundancy, for instance, in the
number of men handling a certain cargo.
A quotation from the actual agreement is
worth reading for its frankness:
“(1) The . . . agreements (will) elimi-
nate restrictions in the contract and
working rules, as well as in unwritten
but existing Union unilateral restrictions
and arbitration awards which interfere
with the Employers’ rights dealing with
sling loads, first place of rest, multiple
handling, gang sizes, and manning scales
so as to allow the Employers to:
a. Operate efficiently.
b. Change methods of work.
c. Utilise labor-saving devices.
d. Direct the work through Employer
representatives.”
What it boils down to is that for the
first time in the industry the employers
were now in charge of their work force,
and the longshoremen did not use their
work rules in an effort to guarantee
themselves against immediate and long-
term redundancy. Employers have been
able to go ahead with mechanisation and
automation programming without fear
of refusal by the longshoremen.
Will Australia learn from the ex-
patriate Australian, Harry Bridges?

Sterilisation Facts and Figures
What the fuss is all about
By ALAN F. GUTTMACHER
The word “sterilisation” conjures up
a wide variety of images: punish-
ment for sex offenders, release
from uncontrollable fecundity, an illegal
act, population control in India, loss of
libido, a new basis for sexual harmony
in strained marriages, Nazi indignities
on Jews —and a host more. “Sterilisa-
tion” provokes this complex of ideas,
first, because it denotes a procedure that
is poorly understood by most people
and, second, because the word itself
sparks an emotional reaction. It has
positive and negative poles, like an
electric battery.
What is sterilisation? It is the sur-
gical procedure by which one renders a
man permanently incapable of fathering
a child or a woman from conceiving a
baby, without at the same time affecting
other sexual functions. In other words,
it is permanent birth control, in contrast
to contraception which is temporary
birth control.
How is it achieved? In the male the
operation is vasectomy. If the integrity
of the vas deferens is interrupted, sperm
cells cannot pass upward to be added to
the other elements of the seminal fluid
at the time of ejaculation. Seminal
fluid devoid of sperm cells is as in-
capable as water of causing pregnancy.
The surgery involved in male sterili-
sation is relatively simple. Each vas
deferens, a hollow tube perhaps an eighth
of an inch in diameter, is exposed by a
small incision on either side of the upper
scrotum. Two linen sutures are placed
an inch or tw'o apart around each vas.
Both sutures are then tightly tied and
the segment of vas between the two cut
out, much like removing the midsection
of a hose and capping the two ends.
The small skin incision is closed by a
few stitches or metal clips and that is it.„
The procedure is frequently done under
a local anaesthetic, though general anaes-
thesia may be used. The risk from
such simple surgery is insignificant
Female sterilisation is considerably
more complicated, since an abdominal
Alan F. Guttmacher, MD, is presi-
dent of Planned Parenthood-World
Population. Dr Guttmacher is also
visiting lecturer at Columbia Medical
School and the Harvard School of
Public Health, and visiting professor
at the Albert Einstein School of Medi-
cine. This article originally appeared
in the New York magazine, “The
Nation.”
operation is required to reach the Fallo-
pian tubes. A three or four inch
longitudinal, midline incision is made,
starting just below the navel. When the
abdomen is open, each tube, with the
circumference of a soda straw, is lifted
up into the wound from its bed in
the pelvis and a knuckle or loop
formed from its middle third. A catgut
dissolvable suture is tied tightly about
the base of the loop and the knuckle
formed cut off with scissors. The two
cut ends of the severed tube held to-
gether by the absorbable catgut tie are
dropped back into the pelvis. Within
several days the catgut dissolves and the
two cut ends of each tube spring apart
since they were held together under
tension. They now lie about an inch
and a' half apart, with the cut ends
sealed closed by scar tissue. Most fe-
male sterilisations are done at the end
of a caesarean section operation or after
normal childbirth.
Since sterilisation in no manner in-
volves either the testes or the ovaries.
it does not alter the physiology of man
or woman. For the male, libido, erec-
tion and ejaculation, even the volume
of semen, should be unchanged, since
the quarter billion spermatozoa are so
tiny that their combined volume is that
of a pinhead. The woman continues
to menstruate and her sex life should be
as before. The reader may note I wrote
“should'’ in the sentence above rather
than “is.” Since sex life is so domi-
nated by the mind, one may discover
that sexual activity is affected by sterili-
sation, despite the fact that there is no
physiological reason for the change. In
some, relief from anxiety about the
occurrence of unwanted pregnancy may
stimulate both sexual activity and res-
ponse. In others, feeling of guilt or a
misinterpretation of the surgical proce-
dure may impair or even destroy set
life. Fortunately, the latter occurrence
is uncommon.
Does the operation ever fail? Yes. it
may. In about 1 per cent of cases the
two severed ends of one of the vas re-
join and spermatozoa reappear in the
ejaculate. In these instances, .reunion
almost always occurs within the fi r - ;
six months. Therefore some surgeons
examine the male ejaculate microscopi-
cally every month for the first half y ear ,
to make certain the sperm cells have not
reappeared. The failure rate for tuba
ligation, salpingectomy, is less —appro* 1 '
mately 0.4 per cent.
Can the operation be reversed, so that
fertility is restored? Yes, in appro* 1
mately half the cases a rejoining opera
tion succeeds in both men and vvonien.
Fifty per cent success is an optimisdc
sounding figure, but not if one belong
to the unsuccessful half. Therefore steo
lisation is never recommended un
both husband and wife are certain
their family is complete. (To be sure, s

a judgment may prove unpredictably
erroneous.)
Attempts at reversal are infrequent
because the necessity is infrequent. The
main experience in men is a by-product
of Nazi inhumanity. Some Jews were
castrated, others were vasectomised. The
castrated victims can never be made
fertile, but through hormone replace-
ment in the form of oral tablets potency
can be completely restored. Fortunately
about half of the vasectomised victims -
reoperated upon have become fathers.
My own experience in reversing salpin-
gectomy stems from the fact that female
sterilisation is a very common procedure
in Puerto Rico. In fact 20 per cent of
the women on the island, between the
ages of fifteen and forty-five, have chosen
to be sterilised, most of them after
having several children. It is the com-
monest operation on the island, com-
moner than appendectomy or tonsillec-
tomy. Since Mount Sinai Hospital in
New York, where I was chief of service,
draws the major portion of its ward
patients from Puerto Rican Americans,
four women came to gynaecology within
a short period to request restoration of
the fertility they had left behind in the
mother country. One, a twenty-one-
year-old girl, claimed she had been steri-
lised premaritally at seventeen upon the
insistence of her fiance! All four
women had been divorced and had re-
married or were contemplating remar-
riage. Fertility was restored in two of
the four.
How common is sterilisation in the
United States itself? By the time a wife
has reached forty, approximately 10 per
cent of marriages have been rendered
infertile through surgery. Four per cent
are the by-product of necessary gynae-
cological surgery in which sterilisation
is not the aim but an unavoidable result.
Such operations are the removal of the
uterus because of fibroid tumors or can-
cer, or the excision of the ovaries be-
cause of cysts or destruction by inflam-
mation. Another 4 per cent of the
wives have been sterilised by tubal liga-
tion with the aim of terminating their
childbearing, some at caesarean section.
Two per cent of US marriages have
been rendered sterile by the husband’s
vasectomy. The 2 per cent male inci-
dence is twice the figure of five years ago.
11/'hy is sterilisation performed? There
Y are three main reasons: to protect
the mother’s health, to prevent the birth
of abnormal infants and because of
socio-economic factors. I repeat, steri-
lisation is not interchangeable with con-
traception; the latter is temporary and
the former is permanent. If and when
there is developed a completely effortless,
wholly agreeable and utterly safe method
of contraception, the operation of steri-
lisation will be abandoned and become
a page in medical history. Until then,
probably some years distant, sterilisation
has an important place in medical pro-
cedures.
I shall give a few examples.
If a woman has serious organic
disease, such as a severe heart condition,
pregnancy is permanently contraindicated
and sterilisation of either wife or hus-
band is medically wise, even necessary.
So too in the case of a woman who has-
huge ropelike varicose veins which be-
come worse with each pregnancy.
When a mating has demonstrated
through the birth of tainted progeny that
the type of difficulty is genetic and
likely to recur in further children, the
couple should be presented with all the
facts and given the option of electing
sterilisation. One such example is
haemophilia, wherein half the sons are
afflicted with a mortal bleeding tendency
and half the daughters transmit the
trait.
Another is Sachs-Tay disease or amau-
rotic idiocy, a condition in which the
child is born apparently normal, pro-
gresses normally for six months and
then retrogresses; it becomes immobile
and helpless and dies at around three
years. One quarter of all the children
of a couple who have produced such a
child will be so afflicted, half will trans-
mit the disease though they themselves
are free of any evidence of it and one-
quarter will not only be normal but also
will not be carriers.
Socio-economic indications for sterili-
sation are less clear-cut. Involuntary
plurality of children has social draw-
backs for many and economic draw-
backs for most. These drawbacks are
particularly apparent and urgent in our
large urban centres. Not all hospi-
tals recognise a specific number of
children as an automatic qualification
for sterilisation; those that do have
usually worked out their own magic
number formula. It may be four or
eight or six.
There are other socio - economic
reasons for sterilisation besides size of
family. For example, inability of parents
to cope satisfactorily with additional
children because of their mental or
emotional deficiency. Then, too, un-
controllable sexual behavior resulting in
a succession of unwanted illegitimate
children is in my view a strong social
indication for voluntary sterilisation.
What is the attitude of religions’
Catholicism finds sterilisation illicit when
the primary object is to render the indi-
vidual sterile. On the other hand, steri-
lisation is judged licit when the primary
object is the removal of a diseased
organ, such as the uterus, and sterility
is a resulting by-product. There is
nothing in the religious ethics of Protes-
tantism or Reform and Conservative
Judaism w'hich opposes sterilisation
Orthodox Judaism, on the other hand,
does not sanction sterilisation.
No doubt the reader w'ould like to
know the author’s attitude. I am abso-
lutely opposed to any form of compul-
sory sterilisation, but feel strongly that
voluntary sterilisation under some con-
ditions and with certain safeguards is
an excellent procedure. In addition to
medical, eugenic and socio-economic
considerations, a normal couple is some-
times entitled to sterilisation. If ®

contraception burdensome, or if they
are continually accident-prone when
using contraceptives, sterilisation °f

ttion tbe un ‘ versa l ice-breaker of
ey ’ ra PPort is established. Definitely
they were underpaid at £ 18-plus a week
(two shows, six days a week) and the
name of the Actors’ Equity man brought
forth hollow girlish laughter,
Between shows there is no rest. Most
of them are speeding to the suburbs in
Mini-Minors or taxis they can ill-afford
to squeeze in a second job at the pubs
and League clubs before coming back
for the second show at 11 or later,
“We went on strike once,” a platinum
blonde English girl said. “It was about
four years ago and we all got sacked,
Nothing happened and we went back.”
Everyone agreed there was not much
point in striking. “We get fined £3 for
working with non-union members,”
another girl said. “You’re supposed to
ask, you see, every time there’s a new
girl, but who does? And we get fined
another £3 if we work below the award
rates. We must be the only people
Actors’ Equity ever fine.”
Glamor there may be, but the romance
went out of the ballet-girl business with
hansom cabs. “We usually go out with
musicians,” one girl said, “but if any-
one outside the profession takes us out
they tell their parents we’re secretaries.”
Some of the girls have worked in
offices, or taken jobs demonstrating elec-
trical gadgets, but they didn’t stay any
longer than necessary.
Rich men are rare. “They’re usually
married. If they’re not married they’re
fat or have mothers who don’t like ballet
girls.” Professionally there is nothing to
move up to. “If you don’t marry you
just go on to be the oldest ballet girl
in the business,” said Andre’s soubrette,
who divorced her guitarist husband five
years ago and supports a young daughter.
Sometimes the girls join a theatre com-
pany so they can travel, but marriage
often brings them back to a club job.
Theatre work pays the same rates,
but there are sometimes irksome restric-
tions. “You're not allowed to wear any
jewellery or nail polish in ‘Camelot’, for
instance,” one girl said, “and you have
to be careful not to get tanned for period
productions. It's all right here pro-
vided you tan in a bikini.”
Parents are usually against their
daughters being ballet girls, but not
always for career reasons. “Mum was
a dancer but she got married at 18, so
she didn’t mind too much, but she’d
rather I’d done classical ballet. You
starve just the same but it’s got more
class.”
The memory of the short-lived Chev-
ron ballet has made them suspicious of
hotel work. “I know Menzies is paying
£25 a week,” said one girl, “but it
won’t last long. As soon as customers
fall off they’ll pay the ballet less and
it'll all be over.”
The girls said that there are no award
rates in Queensland, Western Australia
and presumably Tasmania, where the
girls simply come to an arrangement
with their employers. One girl had
worked four years in Brisbane at hotel
cabaret shows before coming to Sydney,
and thought conditions were fairly rea-
sonable.
The usual format at Andre’s and
Chequers is the opening ballet number,
a supporting act (tumblers, jugglers,
comedy bits), more ballet, then the fea-
tured entertainer, and a final ballet num-
ber, making three appearances in all,
with the show being repeated at 11 or
12. At the Latin Quarter, the girls do
three shows, the last one at 2 a.m.
At the Latin Quarter the girls dance
on a kind of precipitous mezzanine floor,
and only once, says choreographer
Sheila Cruze, has anyone fallen off it —•
at rehearsal. Sheila Cruz, an ex-Tivoli
girl, is also mother to the boys at Les
Girls, Sammy Lee’s other place in Dar-
linghurst Road. “It’s not really very
different,” Miss Cruze said, “but natur-
ally they’re a bit more temperamental.”
One of the boys makes costumes for
the Latin Quarter and if time is short the
girls do a little sequining themselves.
Like their sisters at Andre's, they fill in
breaks with trips to places like the Coo-

gee Beach Hotel to supplement their £lB
a week. There is a big waiting list for
club work, but good girls, combining
face, figure and ability, are hard to come
by.
“I guess we’ve never really thought
about what’ll happen if we don’t get
married,” said one of the Latin Quarter
girls, a lanky brunette called Yvonne.
“But there’s no home for elderly chorus
girls that I know of.” There were better
opportunities than in the theatre for
meeting people and it was not unknown
for customers to make overtures. Two
of the girls had been to New York on
a Tibor Rudas tour, working as acro-
batic dancers at the Latin Quarter there.
Some had been to Europe on similar
tours, and another was planning a trip
to the East.
For some girls, there is a chance for
television work, and the pay for ballet
girls in America is reputed to be excel-
lent.
Only seldom does the chorus line pro-
vide work for the disillusioned classical
ballet student, like Townsville girl Dal-
vern Thom, who came south on a ballet
scholarship and has now switched to
melodrama at the Neutral Bay Music
Hall.
Dalvern was at Chequers only five
months, but loved the work, the people,
and presumably the money which paid
for clothes and cab fares to the Music
Hall between the early and late shows
at the club.
For some ballet girls, like Chequers’
Niki Turner, it happened the easy way.
Born in Australia of Chinese parents,
Niki was working in a Surfers’ photo-
graphic shop when she was seen by
Mr Dennis Wong, who urged her to
come south. “Niki couldn’t dance at all
when she came,” the publicity girl said,
later, “but in two years Ronne Arnold
has made her into a very good dancer.”
After the ballet comes the supporting,
second string act jugglers, various
types of husband and wife teams, and
the perennial risley, perch and dental
acts. In a risley act, one person
bounces from his partner's upturned
feet. Perch acts are done on a bar or
platform supported by some second per-
son, and dental acts involve balancing
feats on something, usually a short
metal rod, held in the partner’s mouth.
Some are good, like the two deadpan
risley performers at Andre's and a team
of Maori singers at Chequers (both last
year), but quite a few are all too obvi-
ously there by the grace of some last-
minute crisis. They wear fixed smiles,
costumes that have seen better days in
worse places, and evoke, depending on
how 7 many martinis you’ve had, more
maudlin sympathy than a regiment of
ballet girls. One hopes, as they trip
beaming from the stage, that they are
not headed for some awful row about
missed cues and muffed timing.
Where nightclub performers come
from and where they go is usually in the
hands of the agent, and Mr Sid Ross’s
agency in Goulburn Street has a nice
read-while-you-wait billboard that gives
a fair indication of the entertainment
market: Comedians W'anted, scriptwriters
available, sight acts needed to tour Japan,
and a warning from Actors’ Equity about
the perils for young girls without a
guaranteed two weeks’ wages from all-
too scrutable Oriental employers.
Dogs and Monkeys
Tt's a microcosm of Mr Ross’s world,
where the raw commodities include
things a nightclub patron never dreams
of, like whip-cracking acts, siffleuses
(rather old fashioned these days), fairy
floss operators and sandwich-board men.
Dogs and monkeys get their innings at
Christmas and birthday parties for child-
ren but stunt men aren’t in demand,
although Mr Ross can remember calls
for men to dive off smokestacks and
buildings into a landing net while wear-
ing somebody’s branded swimsuit.
Television has killed the sandwich-
board man, but the clubs and pubs have
opened a new world for the comedians,
dancers, sight acts and singers. “We
try the singers out in our audition room,
and my son and his secretary listen in
from out here,” Mr Ross explained,
showing a little room with a piano and
a couch. “If it’s a sight act we take
them up on the roof, because it’s a nice
big flat space with a synthetic tarred sur-
face. If it’s a really large spectacular
act, like balancing or trick cycling, theres
no audition, because either they can do
it or they break their necks trying.”
Mr Ross and his fellow agents, who
belong to the lately formed Agents
Theatrical Association, take the tradi-
tional 10 per cent, and since the forma-
tion of the association, a lot of nasty
practices involving vacant lots and non-
existent phone numbers have been
cleaned up.
There was little an agent could do foj
a scriptwriter, Mr Ross said. In the old
days they could farm out material to
variety artists and cabaret turns, but
today the gagwriter was using the direct
approach and, if successful, attaching
himself to a television comedian as pad
of his permanent staff.
Most of his work dealt with singers
dancers and sight acts, sending them
on country tour circuits (10 days to
fortnight) and arranging smaller weeken^
stints nearer Sydney at places like

made a typographical slip and the taxa-
tion men were around in no time. “But
they’re all doing very nicely,” he said,
pointing to his sheet list of more active
clients.
Girl dancers and strippers make up a
large proportion of his business. It was
sad about the dancers, who spent years
of training in various styles, and received
less than the new breed of strippers, who,
said Mr Ross primly, had very little
talent for anything but throwing their
clothes into a corner. “Most of them
should be working in an office, which
is what they probably have been doing,”
Mr Ross said, “but once they get into
the private clubs there’s no limit to what
they can earn.”
Bigger and quicker
Tf there are relatively few people who
can dance, tell jokes or do sight
acts, there are thousands who think they
can sing, and for the handful who actu-
ally can, the going is as tough as in any
other profession. But the fame, when
it comes, is bigger and quicker, and with
the heady examples of Lucky Starr, Little
Pattie, etc., before them, it is not sur-
prising that 600 people have been known
to audition at Channel 9 in two weeks.
Telling a teenager he can’t sing is
probably like telling an adult he has no
sense of humor. The usually hopeless
ones turn up who can’t sing, who dry
up, burst into tears or run. The good
ones, says Alex Kellaway of Channel 9's

Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OF IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder—so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly
may do a lot to help restore your
initiative and drive. Get out of that
rat-race. Tear out this advertisement
and go to your chemist. Or send
your secretary to get a bottle.

for the lucky few out of the hundreds
who start out to their first audition.
What happens to them all eventually?
Popular superstition, at least in the
English novel, says that a lot of female
entertainers wind up as landladies, let-
ting bed-sitters to their professional
descendants, earbashing their boarders
with tales of former glories. Theories
as to the ageing male entertainer are
rarer, but for those without a tidy nest-
egg stacked away, and people in any
branch of the arts are seldom noted for
financial acumen, they probably live,
marry, divorce, pay bills and grow old
just like the customers.
Godfrey Miller
“A few possessions eloquent of their owner ”
Our Sydney art critic, Mr John Hen-
shaw, is at present cataloguing
the paintings of Mr Godfrey
Miller, who died recently. Mr Henshaw
wrote the introduction to a book of
drawings by Mr Miller, published by
Edwards and Shaw. Paintings by Mr
Miller which were in his Paddington
house when he died have been removed
to a bank vault. It is hoped, and Mr
Henshaw believes it is possible, that
there will be a major showing of Mr
Miller's w'ork before the collection is
dispersed.
Mr Henshaw writes:
Some things speak eloquently of their
owners. A few possessions of the late
Godfrey Miller are among these: a
beautifully wrought Neopolitan guitar,
lute-shaped with short string-board, which
inspired some of his finest still life; his
comports lovingly cared for and re-
paired when broken; the walking-stick
a constant companion on daily walks
through the ever-trying hills of Padding,
ton; or the small cedar drawing board
which had been part of a desk in a bank
Ned Kelly had robbed and up till a few
days ago in constant use in the classes at
East Sydney Technical College.
Friends would recall the low wooden
stools on which they sat while Godfrey
fastidiously selected one or two drawings
from a pile. Few dared to hold forth
without carefully sifting their reactions.
The nearby easel in his bedroom-studio,
complete with an improvised seat, hard-
backed but cushioned, was well used.
Behind the seat stood an old wooden
stand w'ith a drawer in its curved front
and over it a mass of painters’ equip-
ment.
For all his love of quiet and privacy
(none of the neighbors, with whom he
was on very good terms, had any idea
he was an artist), Godfrey managed to
keep in touch with a huge number of
friends, few of whom had any idea of
their true number. He seemed a
prolific writer of letters, sometime!
staccato, sometimes flowing, but always
penetrating even to the point of devasta-
tion. Yet there was always an extra-
ordinary kindness about him; he loved
children, he was interested in finding
out the truth and he managed the rare
quality of drawing out of people deeper
responses than they knew they possessed.
He lived in the city but he loved to visit
his friends in the bush suburbs where lie
could sit and admire the trees. Years
ago, when he rented a superb stable-
studio in Young Street, he would often
take a train out Camden way and walk
all night, or perhaps sleep out among
the trees. A series of landscape nocturne
resulted from these experiences.
Very rarely he would speak of bis
early life, though he often discussed th
critical years in a London deaf to the
ominous rumblings of a rising Hitlerism.

constantly over the ’thirties to draw. It
was there he met Dobell, lan Fair-
weather and David Strachan. In the
’forties he was in Sydney working quietly
at sculpture and painting. By 1948 he
taught at East Sydney, exhibited almost
nothing until 1952. His reputation was
always growing, and when he held
exhibitions at the Macquarie and at the
National Gallery of Victoria in 1958
few questioned the significance of his
work. Never pushed by outside influences
he was able to discover himself gradually.
His paintings were to be found in a
few private and most State galleries. In
1962 the Tate Gallery, London, pur-
chased a splendid figure composition
entitled “Tryptich”. Wrongly called a
perfectionist, a term he disliked intensely,
he worked slowly towards a many-sided,
ever-expanding reality, through land-
scape, still life and figure subjects, which
could not be realised in one or any
number of drawings or paintings but
which continually beckoned. Like his
art he was deep, true and immensely
interesting; a rare human being who
was much bigger than we thought.
A Gleam in His Eye
U.S. publisher shops for authors
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The other day I dropped around to the
A Belvedere Hotel in Sydney to talk to
John Willey, a likeable middle-aged man
who is chief editor of William Morrow,
the publishers in America of Morris
West, Barbara Jefferis, George Johnston,
Jon Cleary and other Australian writers.
Mr Willey has been here dealing amiably
with manuscript - laden eager - beavers,
publishers, and other fauna, and hopes
to take up the works of Bill Beatty for
his list.
After saying that non-fiction had
greater sales potential than fiction these
days and that books about the presidents
were, for reasons that didn’t need stress-
ing, very popular at the moment, Mr
G illey got around to the topic of novels.
What about the publication of first
novels, or novels by unknown authors?
That is a most terrific gamble. It's very
like, y to be a sort of commitment to the
author as a talent. A publisher always
as a gleam in his eye. Every once in
a while a first novel will take off in a
most amazing way.
An example I can think of right away
ar per Lee’s ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’.
L| t it would be true to say that a first
novels average sales could be as low as
-''oo. We would need to sell 6000 copies
0 cover our direct costs.”
From struggling first novelists to
Morris West seemed a long leap, but Mr
Willey took it. Yes, he said, “The Shoes
of the Fisherman” had been the most
successful single novel in the firm’s
history. “On the Beach” and West’s
“The Devil’s Advocate” hadn’t been far
behind. West had come to Morrow
through Heinemann, his English pub-
lishers, and “The Devil’s Advocate” had
needed very special promotion . . .
“At first the book clubs gave us none
of their support. They felt the theme was
very touchy. Six months before publica-
tion date we circulated finished copies
to everybody capable of opinion-making.
I wrote personal letters to each one.
Nowadays no single person’s endorse-
ment can sell a book. Once the late
Alexander Woolcott had only to say,
I've gone quietly mad about “Lost
Horizon” ’ for it to be a best seller. Now
it's opinion in the aggregate.
“We got a very exciting reaction from
prominent clergy, authors, and so on.
We spent 10,000 dollars advertising the
book and quoting these people’s re-
actions. It worked, and the book clubs
came in with us.
“No, there was only minor editing on
the novel —you could say, copy editing
only. And the same is true of ‘The
Shoes of the Fisherman’. It came to us
in instalments over six months.”
A small firm with only 10 editorial
staff members culled from former sec-
retaries and salesmen rather than from
literary types, Morrow had clearly made
a fortune from Morris West. “Morris
has just started on his new novel and
we’re very much looking forward to
it,” Mr Willey concluded, looking under-
standably warm, pleased and expectant.


OVERSEAS
Bleak Outlook for
the GOP?
The primaries headlines hut little effect
From GODFREY HODGSON in Washington
Voters in seven of the United States
went to the polls a fortnight ago.
These were only primary elec-
tions, first-round contests within the
parties. The results make headlines,
but they decide little. A George Wal-
lace, running on his anti-Negro, anti-
Federal Government record as Governor
of Alabama, gets 30 per cent of the
Democratic votes in Indiana. A Taft
of the third generation seems to be mov-
ing majestically towards the family’s
almost hereditary seat in the Senate
from Ohio. A famous football coach
may join him there from Oklahoma.
This is the small change of politics. But
it is a reminder that the Presidency is
not the only office that will be up for
election on November 3 this year.
In Britain, and in most other countries,
national and local elections are kept
separate. Here the Presidency is so
much the supreme office, overshadowing
all others both in its practical power and
its power to hold the country's imagina-
tion, that it is easy to think about the
Presidential election, and forget that
thousands of other offices will be filled
on the same day.
Apart from minor local offices, from
judgeships to dog-catchers, half of the
50 States will choose new Governors
this November: 35 of the 100 Senators,
and all the 435 members of the House
of Representatives are up, too.
Barring a miracle or a catastrophe, the
Democrats can count on keeping control
of the White House. But that does not
mean that the Republicans are out of it.
If they can pick up seats in the two
Houses of Congress, eating into the
Democrats’ huge majorities, and winning
back control of the Governor’s Mansion
in some of the traditionally Republican
States in the West and Mid-West that
the Democrats have held for the last
few years, they will be poised to make
a serious attack on the White House
itself in 1968.
If, on the other hand, a divided Re-
publican Party makes a weak or irrespon-
sible campaign against Mr Johnson this
year, the Grand Old Party, and the two-
party system as it has been for the last
100 years, may both face a slow decline.
The sober, non-partisan “Congres-
sional Quarterly” predicts that “the
GOP's survival as a major political
force in the mid-sixties may hinge on
the willingness of an increasingly mature
electorate to ‘split’ ballots on election
day.”
In other words, if everyone who votes
for Mr Johnson this autumn also votes
for Democrats for the Senate, the House,
for Governor, and for all the other
offices on the ticket, the Republicans will
be in for a bleak future.
In the House, there are 78 constitu-
encies now marginal by the test that the
winner last time polled less than 55 per
cent of the vote. Forty of these are now
held by Democrats, and 38 by Republi-
cans. A careful district-by-district analy-
sis suggests, however, that only 38 seats
are now truly in doubt. The Republicans
now hold 178, and the Democrats 257,
of the 435 seats. So even in the extre-
mely unlikely event of the Republicans
winning every seat they have a chance
of winning, they would still fall well
short of the 218 needed to control the
House.
Things look more dangerous for the
Democrats in the Senate, on the surface.
Senators sit for six years, and 1958 was
an annus mirabilis for Democrats. So
now, out of the 35 seats at stake, 26
are Democrats of the generation of 1958.
In at least 15 of these cases, the Repub-
licans have a chance of winning. But
the Democrats are odds-on to keep their
theoretical majority. The true problem
in the Senate will be what it has been:
the division between the progressive
Democrats of the North-East Mid-West
and Far West, and their conservative col-
leagues from the South and its border.
It is perhaps in State politics that
Republican chances look best. There are
three big States in particular where
Democratic incumbents are in shaky
positions: Illinois, perhaps the shakiest
of all, is a truly major State, and a Re
publican victory there would enable t e
party to build an organisation whic
could stand it in good stead in 19
Not only that. It is from these \oc&
battles that the personalities emerge w

is the very model of the modern business
executive, a whiz kid who was the boss
of the big Bell and Howell camera firm
at the age of 29- He is good-looking,
and so are his children. But he still
has to win in Illinois before he can dream
of the White House, and the big national
Democrats have sworn to get him.
Still, that is one name to watch.
Another is the ebullient Pierre Salinger
who was Mr Kennedy’s Press secretary,
a child prodigy on the piano, and the
best advertisement the cigar industry has
had since President Harding said “What
this country needs is a good five cent
cigar”. He is running for the Senate
from California. His opponent is the
sober Alan Cranston, founder of that
State’s liberal Democratic movement, and
now a high State official. Mr Salinger
seems to have mustered the rich and the
raffish as well as the New Frontiersmen
in his corner. Whoever wins will be a
power in Washington now that Califor-
nia is the biggest as well as the bounciest
State.
Among the crop of Southern Repub-
licans who are hoping to capitalise on
the strains the civil rights crisis has
caused in the South's Democratic oligar-
chies, two diametrically different men
are especially worth watching.
One is a petrol station owner from
rural Alabama called Jim Martin: what
is interesting about him is that in 1962
he nearly upset the venerable Lister Hill,
one of the most responsible of the South’s
elder statesmen by dint of taking the
extremest possible segregationist position.
If he brings it off this time, the lesson will
be plain to Republicans all over the
South: “Don’t let anyone ‘out-seg.’
you.”
Winthrop Rockefeller’s strategy is a
little different. He is the brother of
Nelson Rockefeller, the Liberal Gover-
nor of New York, and was sent to Ar-
kansas for his health a dozen years ago.
He is trying to beat the Governor of Ar-
kansas by taking the other tack; for the
Governor is none other than Orval
Faubus of Little Rock fame. Faubus is
not worried. “Let’s see whether a poor
boy can still beat a millionaire”, says he
grimly.
These are just some of the sideshows
to watch as Lyndon Johnson scientifically
destroys his Republican challenger in the
main event. But there will be others.

be, can nevertheless be relied on to throw

Notes
On
Integration
Defection of the White
Liberals?
From ARNOLD BEICHMAN
in New York
The sixteen-year-old son of some
friends of mine returned a few
weeks ago from a school party
ecstatic his first crush. She was a
Negro girl, he told his mother, and he
had made a date with her for the fol-
lowing Saturday. They would meet in
Manhattan, see a movie, have an ice-
cream soda and then he would escort her
home. He told his mother the girl’s ad-
dress, a street in a rather heavily Negro-
populated section of Long Island. His
mother, in every sense of the word a
liberal, told her son:
'You may take her out, you may have
a 'i the dates you want, you may bring
her here. You cannot take her home.”
The youth, horrified, protested against
vvhat he called his mother’s racism. The
Ether came into the living-room during
me argument, heard the story. He agreed
completely with the ban. But why, why,
me boy asked?
Because a young white boy like you
taking home a Negro girl in a Negro
neighborhood would be beaten up and
' y e don t want that to happen,” was the
lather’s reply.
A friend who teaches drama at a major
merican university—also a liberal—
to see the new James Baldwin play,
mes for Mister Charlie”. During the
, rs t interniisson, he and his wife went out
ln lo the lobby for a smoke, a normal
Cu stom in Broadway theatres. At the
second-act intermission, and thereafter,
the couple sat immobilised in their seats.
“I was just horrified,” he said, “at the
hate for the white man —for me —on the
stage. But I could have taken that. What
frightened me is how the Negro part of
the audience greeted each expression of
hate for the white man. I simply couldn’t
go out to the lobby and look at the Negro
faces who had just been roaring with
appreciation at what was being said and
done on the stage.”
I know a white Labor leader who has,
for some years, been in the avant-garde
in the battle for Negro rights. He is no
longer avant-garde. It is not because he
feels his leadership threatened in his own
union. He beat down the opposition of
his membership to integration in the
union. He was a leader last summer of
the March-on-Washington movement and
brought with him a contingent of white
and Negro members. Today he is dis-
affected by the civil rights movement, but
isn’t quite sure why.
These stories illustrate a rather un-
happy development in the Northern
United States in recent months. The white
liberal —and it is not as pejorative a
phrase as it has come to symbolise—has
begun to defect in large numbers from
the civil rights movement; that is, many
ol those liberals who were in the fight
are now sitting on their hands. Other
white liberals who had remained aloof
are now openly hostile, fearful, irritated.
The white American mood has changed
—and I am talking about the intelligent,
educated, anti-segregationist American in
Northern cities, and particularly New
York.
T ast September, when I returned to
America after an absence of several
months, I could sense a tremendous
change of atmosphere in American white
liberal opinion, a change that boded
well, I felt, for Negro rights. The March-
on-Washington had been successful and
even inspiring. There was, if I may use
the word, a sense of togetherness between
Negro and white who had “marched” or
who had just read about it. Since then —
and I have no public opinion surveys to
offer, merely (I hope) sensitive antennae
—it has been downhill. Whites—not
merely Southerners —have become sen-
sitive to their whiteness.
Until recently, it was a simple matter
to be a liberal as far as civil rights were
concerned. It was a problem for Biloxi,
Baton Rouge, Nashville, but not for
Brooklyn or Manhattan. The landmark
school decision of the US Supreme Court
ten years ago meant south of the Mason-
Dixon line. Now it has moved above the
line.
William P. Rogers, the former United
States Attorney-General and an Eisen-
hower Republican, told an interviewer in
the “Christian Science Monitor” re-
cently:
In a country with 90 per cent
whites and 10 per cent Negroes,
there is a limit to which a minority
can force a majority to go ... a
limit to which they can insist that
government eliminate prejudice.
In April, 264,000 voters in Wisconsin
voted for the segregationist Southerner,
Governor George Wallace, 25 per cent of
the total primary vote. Following this
in the May 19 primary in Maryland
Governor Wallace once more polled well
against the Democratic Senator Daniel
Brewster who won.
The opening of the New York World
Fair was to have been marred by a stall-
in’’ of automobiles driven by civil rights
protestants. It was an idea dreamed up
by leaders of the Brooklyn chapter of the
Congress of Racial Equality, CORE. The
national CORE leadership repudiated the
idea. In any case, there was no stall-in.
New York’s Underground was to be
paralysed. That, too, failed. On April 21,
a gang of young Negroes attacked a Jew-
ish religious school in Brooklyn, injuring
some students and a rabbi. Police made
arrests, but the school authorities declined
tc prosecute.
These are a few examples of external
problems with which the civil rights
movement has had to contend. On an
interpersonal level and on an institutional
level, something has gone wrong and
none knows this better than the mature
Negro leadership. Today this leadership
must contend with new and younger
Negro dissidents who have no patience
for negotiation and political pressure.
I state these things as plain and
simple facts. The civil rights battle is
losing the sympathies of hitherto sympa-
thetic whites in the North. And there
is no point in denouncing them as “fake
liberals” or “summer soldiers”. The
denunciations are irrelevant to the
description of things as they seem to be
developing. A Northern white liberal can
still be indignant about the use of police
dogs and electric cattle prods against
Negroes in Southern streets and be
equally indignant at the proposal to
enforce school integration in New York’s
public schools.
These are not pleasant things to re-
count and I prefer to understate them,
but there is no question that the North-
ern white liberal is no longer engage in
the civil rights battle. It has become per-
sonal, emotional so much so that the
Northern white liberal has dropped the
word “Negroes”. It is now “they”. And
I hesitate to say it, but I think there is
no longer a crisis of conscience for the
white liberal. He is, surely, for passage
of the Civil Rights Bill now before the
Congress, but it is now a ritualistic
approval.

Puppets Which Refuse

Nobody ever tells Mr K. anything. ..?
From EDWARD CRANKSHAW in London
There is a danger that the spectacu-
lar aspects of the grand central
drama of the Moscow-Peking quar-
rel will be allowed to obscure all sorts
of lesser movements of more immediate
relevance. Some of these, seen as part of
the general confusion in the Communist
world arising from the struggle between
the two giants, are not really part of that
drama, or ancillary to it at all, and can-
not be properly understood if they are
considered as such.
Thus, the extraordinary activities of
the Italian Communist Party do not owe
their origin to the great quarrel—which,
nevertheless, serves the Italians with a
pretext for pursuing them. Their roots go
deeper.
In general, the fissile tendencies of
what may still be called for convenience
(though misleadingly and inaccurately)
the world Communist movement, while
they become more striking every week,
were in fact in full swing long before
the Sino-Soviet dispute was formalised
even in secret sessions of the Party. What
has happened is that the Russians, suing
for support, can no longer afford to
sit on manifestations of independence
among the fraternal parties which, a few
years ago, would not have been tolerated.
The Italians are sending a delegation
to the Congress of the French Com-
munist Party (Italian and French Com-
munists have been at loggerheads for
many a long year) with the prime task
of winning round the French comrades
to their way of thinking about a world
Congress of Communist Parties to thresh
out the Sino-Soviet dispute.
They are against such a Congress.
They have been saying so consistently
for months.
The official Italian argument is that
such a Congress could only lead to an
irreparable division between the two con-
tenders for power, Moscow and Peking.
But it is plain that the chief concern of
the Italians is to prevent the existing
situation of extreme fluidity, which can
be exploited by each separate party in
its own national interests, from crystallis-
ing out into a firm division under the
rival authorities of Moscow and Peking
a division which could only lead to
the reimposition of strong centralised
discipline within each of the two camps.
This feeling seems to be spreading.
One of the most remarkable develop-
merits of the year has been the amount
of coming and going between delegations
from junior parties, all interested prim-
arily not in settling the Sino-Soviet dis-
pute, but in coming to special ad hoc
arrangements between themselves, some-
times at the expense of both the Soviet
Union and China, or in trying to ham-
mer out agreed lines of policy; or lobby-
ing each other for support in this or that
demarche to Moscow, if not behind
Moscow’s back, at least in order to be
able to present united fronts to Moscow.
One would be tempted to sympathise
with Mr Khrushchev. He must sometimes
complain that nobody ever tells him any-
thing. But no doubt he has his spies
as do the Chinese. And there is no doubt
at all that, in spite of certain inconveni-
ences, the autonomous leanings of his
one-time helots by and large, and for
the time being, suit his book.
They ought to suit ours, too, if only
we could give up hypnotising ourselves
with talk of a generalised Communist
menace, which is ten years out of date.
But it is not much good seeking to draw
the various Communist countries in
highly various degrees into closer com-
munion with the West until we at least
take the trouble to distinguish between
one kind of Communism and another.
There is not yet much sign of this hap-
pening.
And yet an understanding of the real
aims and aspirations of the many Com-
munist Parties, an infinitely complicated
task in Europe alone how much more
in Latin America, Africa, Asia, the
Middle East?—is of far, far greater im-
mediate importance than a conscientious
listing of the number of parties which
have split on the Sino-Russian issue. This
is simple enough. Sooner or later, and
in greater or lesser degree, they will a"
split on this issue the ones that haven t
done so already.
Our interest is to discover the under-
lying reasons, which vary wildly, f° r
individual factions behaving in certain
ways and, above all, and nearer
home, to establish the nearest thing " e
can to working relations with all th° se
parties now in power, or with the P os
sibility of achieving power, and whic
are determined never again to become
mere puppets in the hands of an irnpena
master, whether in Moscow or PeKin-
(OFNS.)

SPORT
Surfing,
Surfies
and Soccer
Sometimes they plain
fell off ...
By DISCUS
years ago at Bondi the big seas
A used to roll in to the beach with
a welter of surfers, Surf-o-plane riders,
and a few hardy heroes on wooden surf-
boards, their number limited by the skill
required to ride one of the things.
Mostly, Australian surfers were content
to swim “out the back”, wait for a big
wave, and ride it in to the beach, then
swim out for another one. If you did
a lot of it, it was hard work, and deve-
loped a physique which could only be
ruined by too much time at the hotel
bar.
These reminiscences are prompted by
the recent sight of a moderate number
of youths, built like bean vines, com-
peting for something described as the
World Surf Championships at Manly
Beach.
Surf riding on fibreglass boards is a
new sport with about 1000 registered
members and, according to one of its
officials, a potential of 5000 members at
present. This puts it somewhere down
the bottom of the sports table, where I
suggest it will stay, because it is a sport
for people with one thing that few peo-
ple have, a very good sense of balance.
Without that, it is an unprofitable, and
sometimes ludicrous, occupation. And
it costs something like £4O for a board,
apart from the transport.
On the recent occasion in Sydney it
was presented as a spectator sport, with
masses of publicity, weighty trophies,
and support from television stations. One
station followed it for four hours. Tele-
vision has taken up sport in a big way,
and that is good, but this was ridiculous.
The spectacle consisted of one titanic
attle after another between man and
wave. The man paddled on to the
wave, stood up on his board, and rode
across the wall of the wave, sometimes
through the “tube” of a curling breaker,
hen swung left or right according to
ls judgment, to ride the foam —now
c alled “soup - ’. He rode some distance
and was thrown off, or he dipped off,
and sometimes he plain fell off and lost
ls board. Points were awarded.
Compared to a full-scale surf carnival,
it was as exciting as a walk in the bush
on a very wet Sunday.

HThis weekend the Everton Soccer team
from England will play its last
match in Australia, and probably its most
valuable one, against an “under 23” side
composed mostly of colonial boys.
Everton’s visit brought some honest
sobriety to the Soccer camp. After years
of importing “star” players from almost
every country in the world, Australia
fielded teams which Everton treated as
a joke, though generally they were polite
about it.
I saw the second half of the Second
“Test”, after watching the first half of
a Sydney v. Country Rugby League
match in which the most interesting
thing was the Soccer scoreboard visible
at the neighbouring Showground. Aus-
tralia had held Everton to a 1-all draw
at half time, but, strangely enough, the
visitors scored three goals in quick suc-
cession in the second half, then lapsed
into some more exhibition football.
Much more so than the scores or the
reports of matches indicated, Everton’s
players did as they liked with the Aus-
tralian side. If the Australians got the
ball, an Everton player would nip in and
take it from them. Then he’d pass to
where his support should have been,
tactically, and, inevitably, the man was
there to take the ball and pass it on.
When the Australians passed it was
often to thin air or open ground. Our
team looked old, and slow, and not very
enthusiastic, with few exceptions.

Light" is matched, if not surpassed by

It was still a much better match to
watch than the Sydney-Country Rugby
League. That it drew only 40,000 was
largely due to the disappointment 50,000
people experienced at the first Everton
match against NSW, when the English-
men played like a team of strangers.
Why this opening match of the tour was
played in Sydney and not in Brisbane or
Adelaide, only Soccer officials can tell.
The Rugby League is not making the
mistake of putting its visitors on in Syd-
ney first up. It's going to the other
extreme. They have played in Dar-
win, all parts of Queensland, and then
in Sydney. Then they play NSW, which
is Sydney over again, with a couple of
country players for the sake of appear-
ances. Finally they will play Australia,
or Sydney with a couple of Queens-
landers for the sake of, etc.

Selectors do some strange things, such
as omitting Dave Prince from the
Olympics athletics team, and the LTAA-
created “rebels” from the Davis Cup
team, and Kevin Carton from the men’s
hockey team for Tokyo. But the selec-
tors are beyond appeal. If ever an
Ombudsman was needed, it's in sport.
The men's hockey squad is one export
to Tokyo which has a chance of coming
up trumps. Of the fifteen selected, 14
have previously represented Australia,
some on occasions when our team has
given one or two of the top hockey
nations a shaking. So this time we send
them away without their previous
captain.
The selectors were not as kind to
Kevin Carton as the English cricket
selectors have been to Ted Dexter, whom
they at least left in the team. Carton
went right out. However, this .time the
West cannot feel that this is another
of those cases similar to Barry Shep-
herd's. Six of the 15 selected are from
Western Australia, which won the men’s
hockey title for the third year in a row.

i"|NE of the strengths of Australian
League football is the Coulter Law,
which outlaws bids for other clubs' best
players, or the open placing of transfer
fees on players. The rule has been
flouted since it was introduced, but it is
always there as a dampener on strong
clubs’ ambitions. Recently Claremont
in the West dared to ask Geelong £4OOO
for the services of Denis Marshall, and
Geelong paid, and the VFL banned the
transfer. It was something of a comedy
of errors, because Marshall was moving
to Melbourne to be with his fiancee, and
Geelong appears to have paid unneces-
sarily, while Claremont has gained £4OOO
as a gift.
But the VFL appears to have con-
sidered the price beyond reason, and
the time ripe to lower the boom. Most
Australian League men agree that £4OOO
is an extraordinary amount to pay for
a player. In Sydney, a Rugby League
player named Arthur Summons is of the
same opinion. He wants to move to
Wagga as manager of the local League's
Club and player-coach of the Wagga
team, but his club, Western Suburbs,
placed a transfer fee of £3500 on him.
Summons is one of the best Rugby
League players around, but in his sport
even £3500 is not high. Sydney club
St George recently paid an English club
£12,500 for a forward named Dick
Huddart. St George runs a flourishing
League club, with very large poker
machine profits. It could afford a team
of Dick Huddarts, and possibly will.
Needless to say, it is the team most
likely to run away with the Sydney
Rugby League premiership.
This kind of thing does not happen
in lands where Coulter’s law, and
those who have criticised the VFL over
its stand in the Marshall case should
reflect on the fact.


Around Melbourne
SCIENCE-WITH SHERRY, MOSELLE AND COGNAC
Unquestionably the most exciting
serial we have ever offered on
this page has been the saga of Vic-
toria’s liquor. In our last episodes
our protagonist, Mr P. D. Phillips,
QC, Royal Commissioner, was deeply
involved in his liquor inquiry. He had
done battle with the breweries, he
had brilliantly persuaded some of our
leading clergy to his own way of
thinking, and he had been on a
personal tour of Melbourne pubs at
night on closing time. NOW READ
ON:
Some months back Mr Phillips
intimated that he would hold a test
dinner, not so much a temperance
affair, but an occasion where they
could really find out, scientifically,
what happens at a dinner party. Dear
reader, this party has taken place and
it was a beauty. The venue was
University House.
Now, you must understand that
University House, in effect, is the
professors’ club at Melbourne Uni-
versity. The lovely old awning from
Ogg’s Pharmacy is outside and the
whole place has a reputation. An
invitation to a private dinner party
at University House is something to
be savored, for nobody can do it
better in Melbourne.
Among those invited were Mr
Kevin Coleman, assisting the Com-
mission, and Mrs. Coleman, Mr
R- F. G. Fogarty, chairman of all
our breweries, Mr S. W. Johnson,
Senior Lecturer in Criminology, Mr
S. E. Sharp, of the Wine and Brandy
Producers’ Association, the Rev. D.
Hurse of the Presbyterian Church,
and Dr J. E. Sewell.
Before dinner there was a choice
of martinis or Rhine Castle’s Rameda
extra dry sherry. At dinner the first
course was a choice of consomme or
spaghetti marinara. The next course
was fresh-water trout, which was
served with Rhine Castle Victorian bin
92 moselle. This done, there was
filet mignon and what was described
as a rather lovely Cowalta Hunter
River hermitage, vintage 1958.
Then, if one didn’t want the cassata,
the mellow dry hermitage could
guide one on through the cheeses.
Finally, with the coffee there was
Cockburn’s port from Portugal, Remy
Martin cognac VSOP, Drambuie or
Benedictine; as Mr Phillips put it:
“A very enjoyable dinner party.”
Everything was scientifically re-
corded under the sharp eyes of the
pathology expert, Dr Norman Mc-
Callum, and the police surgeon, Dr
John Birrell. The star performer of
the evening, and the deliberate test
case, had two martinis, one dry
sherry, two white wines, one red wine,
two ports and one liqueur. His breath-
alyser reading was .053. The police
are inclined to look upon .050 as the
plimsoll mark.
Mr Phillips obviously was pleased
with the whole affair. Everyone drank
varying amounts of alcohol, but no
one more than the equivalent of 9}
7oz beers. So, if liquor was con-
sumed slowly in relaxed conditions in
not unreasonable quantities, one
wouldn’t come to any harm. As he
put it: “It seems that people who
show a reading of more than one per
cent in police tests must be having
one hell of a time.”
the last guest finally departed
from University House at 11
p.m. Naturally, we were agog to
know who paid for the feast. It was
a little disappointing to discover
later that it was what we used to call
a “Yankee shout”: everybody dubbed
in.
Of course, we can hardly wait now
to see what is coming next. Mr
Phillips said earlier that the dinner
party was only one of several experi-
ments he had in mind. He also wanted
to see what happened at a smoke
social, and one can only presume that
the queue of scientific volunteers for
this will be bigger than for the
Beatles.
The old Royal Commission hands
report that they have never seen a
man so happy in his job. PD has style
and aplomb. He always iooks nicely
turned out, with white cuffs and gold
links. The “Herald” reported one day
that he was a very modern character
in a synthetic suit. PD corrected this
at once. It was not a synthetic suit.
It was pure Veronese silk.
As he warms to his subject he’s an
interesting man. He feels that our
drinking habits are most revealing.
He says that Australians have great
difficulty in communicating; there’s
a strange sort of restraint or reserve
which prevents them from putting
over their true feelings. The only
time they really become alive and
actually communicate is in the warm
atmosphere of a bar. That’s why you
don’t see many chairs in Melbourne
pubs. People don’t really want them.
They like to natter head-to-head.
And in the Commission itself he
likes to wander down some weird
alleys. One day he got on to this most
delicate point should one buy a
drink when one is a club guest. Said
PD: “I’m never quite sure when I’m
expected to buy a drink or not. The
more exalted the club, the less inclined
I am to offer to pay for a drink.”
PD’s instinct was reasonably sound.
We checked on the most utterly
exalted clubs, and they were affronted
at the very idea of a guest paying.
However, on lesser levels of exaltation,
guests seemed to do a lot of paying.
It all started back on November
14, and now it seems our serial could
run as long as “Blue Hills”. The first
eight days of the Commission alone
produced 880 foolscap pages and
308,000 words. The end is not in
sight yet. PD has said that he may
not file his report until the New Year.
He did make one revealing comment
at one day’s hearing: “I was invited
to report to the Government on
various aspects of the liquor industry.
I don’t know whether it was a joke
or whether some useful purpose will
be served."
Will PD succeed with his inquiry?
Will Victoria get 10 p.m. closing?
Will PD’s report get landed with a
hostile Labor Government? To get
the answer to these questions don’t
miss our next gripping episode.

WOOMERA - 1964

miles away in the Great Sandy Desert

Indian Ocean. It will be the maiden
flight of the Blue Streak and the first
launch in Australia of a space vehicle
capable of intruding upon the universe.
If the flight succeeds, and confident
are the predictions for its success,
Woomera will be established, finally, as
a spaceport as capable and as equipped
as Cape Kennedy. For Britain, which
made the rocket, it will represent a
triumphant end to a defence muddle
which almost brought down the Mac-

The importance of Blue Streak s first
flight is that it is he veh.de whtch s*
European nations (the UK France, W
Germany, Italy, Holland Belgium) and
Australia will use for their first com-
bined space probes. Blue Streak, aban-
doned by Britain as a military weapon,
is the launch-pin of ELDO, the European
Launcher Development Organisation,
which has agreed, initially, to provide
£A9s million capital over five years for
a purely European space programme—
and Australia, in this context of the
space game, is in the European orbit.
The organisation, which is now a legal
entity, was created by Convention signed
at London in February, 1962. Only

The 1966 |aunch i$ on|y , he flrs( of
several space voyages which may in-
elude a European man in space from
Australian territory—which will be made
from Woomera. Over £12,500,000 will
be spent on the Europa One complex at
Woomera on equipment, installations,


housing for the 300 European techni-
cians and their families which will be
based there —including a £350,000 pre-
paration building. The ELDO design
will be (a) to place in orbit a one-ton
satellite roughly 300 miles from earth,
(b) to place a 2001 b satellite into an
elliptical polar orbit extending to 100,000
miles out from earth, (c) inject a 4501 b
satellite into high equatorial orbit. For
this mission 6A, itself about as lar£e as
a 12,000-ton ship and more complex
than a squadron of Boeing 707’s with its
radar, telemetry, electronic and computer
stations, will be the launch pad.
New requirements
A ustralia’s contribution will be to
provide the Launcher 6A, the 1250-
mile range from Woomera to Talgarno,
to open up a second transcontinental
range with which polar orbits can
more easily be obtained —a range stretch-
ing from Woomera to the Gulf of Car-
pentaria and beyond to the Arafura Sea
—and negotiate the possibility of a third,
shorter range extending from Woomera
in the general easterly direction of nor-
thern New South Wales. These new—
and politically difficult requirements
include the possibility of siting a new
launcher-space station in Arnhem Land.
Ambitious space plans are now being
laid by ELDO. The Germans are
keenly lobbying for a manned space
flight programme. The British Govern-
ment, which has never favored manned
space flight since it believes more useful
data can be obtained by robots more
safely and more cheaply, is resisting this
pressure. It is sponsoring an ELDO-
Commonwealth satellite communications
system which would provide revenue for
other space endeavors, and which would
carry at minimum cost world-wide tele-
vision channels, telephone photo facsi-
mile transmissions. If this plan bore
fruit the London “Times”, for instance,
could publish its news pages simulta-
neously in every city of the Common-
wealth, perhaps as a supplement to some
other newspaper in each city. A tele-
phone call between London and Sydney
would cost only a few pence. But in
spite of opposition, HSD’s advanced
projects division, in London, has been
working on a manned spaceflight capsule
design for at least nine months—part of
the vision of ELDO for manned space
stations and astronomical observatories.
And within a year ELDO is likely to
resolve its plans for the future, plans
which include such advanced propulsion
techniques as nuclear power and guid-
ance and control systems for robots and
their payloads.
There is vague talk of a successor to
Blue Streak by the 1970 s in vague cost-
ing terms of “hundreds of millions of
pounds sterling.” And it is not beyond
prosperous Europe’s resources to meet
a bill of £I,OOO million, the estimated
price of its space programme as seen
in the planning stage for the next ten
years.
ELDO, that promise which Europe
needs, and upon which Woomera’s future
might well have depended in the long
term, thus seems a reality.
Woomera’s coming of age will have
taken 17 years. Its record without
Blue Streak —has been impressive. First
was its creation; then its expansion; then
its operations.
At Phillip’s Ponds, roughly 100 miles
north of Port Augusta, or 300 miles
north of Adelaide, there is the grave of
a stockman. The headstone states:
“Sacred to the memory of John Elenry
Davies, 12th January, 1884, aged
(about) 24 years. This stone is erected
by his fellow bushmen living at Mt Eba
station.” Davies, it is believed, died of
thirst and dysentery. But his headstone
was, when a survey party looking for
the site of a British rocket range ar-
rived close by in 1945, one of the few
signs that white man had passed this
way. To the survey party the vista
seemed one part red oxide earth and
gibber, and clumps of spinifex, and
three parts sky. Artifacts of a race
and age which no one cared to assess
littered the face of the blistered land.
But for all its loneliness, its inhospitality,
although men without water could not
live more than nine hours, life flourished
inexplicably; the land supported ten
sheep on each square mile (Belgium
supports 125 people per square mile);
needlebrush, desert finish, purple para-
keelya, mulga, myall; kangaroos, emus,
parrots. There were tectites, which
could explain the origins of the world,
and full signs of past primeval lushness,
marine life; carvings by primeval man
in stone so iron that today electrically
powered tools are needed to mark them.
A timelessness: a silence which could
not be recorded, and there were un-
questionable signs that strange animals
had passed this way before, leaving im-
prints to be interpreted with qualification
by students of prehistoric times. To a
romantic it might seem appropriate that
this was the place to which the British
—with their love of deserts—came with
a design of their own to penetrate the
universe. For Woomera, named after
the Aboriginal spear-launching device,
was clearly involved in the beginnings
of the world —a magnitude of emptiness
all the way from Pimba, a whistle-stop
on the Transcontinental Railroad, to
Eighty-Mile Beach on the Indian Ocean.
This was the site of the creation of
the Australian spaceport.
It stemmed directly from the arrival
of that jeep convoy at the stockman's
grave. The British Governments were
looking closely at two developments of
the German V 2 rocket which bombarded
London: one with a range of 300 miles,
the second a multi-stage intercontinental
missile designed by the Germans to
bombard New York —with a range of
3000 miles. “The Poms,” said a Supply
PRO, “had found what they wanted
a vast overland range, 3300 hours of
sunshine a year, cloudless skies for nine
months of the year, rainfall of 7 inches,
close to a rail link, good for airfield
building.” The Australian Government
established one prohibited zone as large
as England and Wales not far from the
opal mines at Coober Pedy. A second
prohibited zone, as large as France, was
declared in the Australian north-west.
Connecting the two was a swathe of
territory, largely uninhabited by whites,
but bisecting the Central Aboriginal
Reserve. And there was an extension
of another 1500 miles out into the
Indian Ocean towards Christmas Island.
Aboriginals and the Range
A survey party started to march down
the centre line (the line along which
rockets were to be launched). It was
the first such march since Giles’ march
in 1875. And on April 1, 1947, the
Long Range Weapons Establishment
(known as “Lambs, Rams, Wethers and
Ewes”) was born. Its headquarters was
a mosquito-ridden stockman’s hut; the
scientists, boffins, hardware men and civil
engineers lived in bell-tents on concrete
slabs. The first thing they built was an
airstrip, the second a pipe to bring water
in 300 miles from the Murray R*
And as the range developed so did its
critics attack this endeavor in the wilder
ness, question its morality, its uselessness,
point to its immorality.
One of the most immediate condem
nations of Woomera was that it was
destroying the Australian Aboriginal way
of life. A report horrifying enoug
—was compiled on the down-range area
by an all-party Select Committee o
Western Australian Parliament.

Blue Streak stands on its pad in the last stages of the two-day countdown. Its hull, eggshell thin, is kept erect
by pressurised air. It stands 9 5ft tall and is powered by 60 tons of liquid oxygen and 26 tons of kerosene.

it depends on water pumped 300 miles across the desert in a ten-inch pipe from the Murray River.

only sign that a white man had ever passed that way when surveyors decided to establish Woomera close by .


report quickly became the bludgeon
with which its antagonists hoped to
demolish the range. The report told of
disease, starvation, displacement and pri-
vation. The charges ran the full span
—murder; an Aboriginal woman being
photographed as she was having a child;
allegations that the natives were denied
access to water; the construction of scien-
tific tracking outposts in the nomads’
hunting grounds led to charges that the
Aboriginal was being driven into the
desert wastes to die of thirst and hunger,
or to attach himself as cheap labor to
mining camps, railway settlements. Abo-
riginal women were being taken at
gunpoint for rape. Expeditions set out
to examine the charges. All investiga-
tion failed to support the graver accusa-
tions of widespread suffering. Equally
it was conceded that there were local
cases and finally the Committee’s report
was discredited. But it led to vigorous
laws being introduced at Woomera to
protect the black man —laws so rigorous
that any infringement meant instant dis-
missal and legal proceedings.
At Woomera the hardware men, when
justifying the morality of bisecting and
trisecting a continent as a playground
for rockets, like to quote Faraday when
asked what useful purpose electricity
could have. “One day,” he replied,
“They may be able to tax it.”
Woomera town went up in a depres-
sion several miles north of Pimba, a
town whose livelihood was connected
with the railroad, a gas station, and gib-
bermen making £3 a ton collecting the
stones off the desert for a portable gravel
plant nearby. The pipes, wires, asphalt,
stone, bricks, wood, glass, air-condi-
tioners, light bulbs, taps, toilets, every
supply necessary for life support in al-
m °st as hostile an environment as the
moon surface itself, had to be brought
m by train, truck and air overland from
Augusta or Adelaide.

l mdred homes, a fire station and a

course, 73 clubs, a cricket ground,
.000 trees, a zoo, an arboretum, kerb-
roads, lawns, a hospital, a tele-
Q one service, a newspaper (the “Gibber
a her ), a community store which
a es £25,000 a year profit, the para-
P er nalia of a township. It is also a
classic example of what can be done
with a desert: out of the wilderness
sprout cannas, zinias, orchids, shrubs,
hibiscus, frangipani, poinsettia, roses,
carnations. It has a town council, a
police force and no slums. The birth-
rate is the highest in Australia, and
there are few crimes of violence. There
is constant drama in the skies overhead
a flare of fire by night, a pillar of
smoke by day.
The building of Woomera was a con-
struction project of magnitude, and an
interesting human experiment: the trans-
planting of boffins, missile men, electro-
nics engineers, laborers, soldiers, arti-
sans, administrators from settled, tem-
perate communities on to a hot plateau
in the security-conscious, vacuumatic
world of aerospace. A comparison with
the community at Cape Kennedy space-
port might be appropriate. There crimes
of violence, divorce, psychological dis-
orders are commonplace. In the 17
years of Woomera’s existence there has
been one murder charge, which was later
commuted to manslaughter, divorce is
a rarity, and the main medical preoccu-
pation is to do with obstetrics. The pace
is less frenetic, the town more orderly,
less garish, more composed than one
finds at Kennedy.
This civil engineering - sociological
accomplishment was soon to be repeated
in the fields of technology and commu-
nications. Three thousand square miles
of desert soon became a weft and warp
of coaxial cables and high-speed com-
munications systems. Computers, elec-
tronic eyes, radars, kine-theodolites,
liquid oxygen and nitrogen plants, ex-
plosives stores, assembly rooms for air-
craft and rockets, dust-free, air-con-
ditioned plants for operating sensitive
machines; systems to measure upper
atmosphere physics, space radiation, pro-
pulsion units, control systems operations
—all the complicated and sensitive appa-
ratus of aerospace arrived and were
accommodated.
Since space satellites spend as much
time in the Southern as in the Northern
Hemisphere the US’s National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration lobbied
f or a nd obtained facilities at
Woomera and elsewhere in Australia to
set up establishments to hold together the
links of their world-wide tracking and
telemetry organisation. Apparatus for
penetrating most parts of the visible
heavens was installed a minitrack
system, aerials and recording equipment
to listen to sounds from space, a Baker
Nunn tracking camera which can
photograph a tennis ball at 1000 miles
in space. The first station was estab-
lished in 1958 in time for the Interna-
tional Geophysical Year and is equipped
to record space sounds from man-made
vehicles 1000 million miles away. There
are now three major tracking stations for
deep space probes in the Western world
Goldstone in California, Woomera and
Johannesburg: three stations equipped
with great dish-like antennae 85ft wide
in diameter, each spaced at roughly
120 degrees of latitude.
Music of the Universe
HThe reason for Woomera’s selection
for this responsibility is perhaps the
reason for its existence as a rocket range:
visibility for optical tracking instruments
is outstanding, the clarity of radio recep-
tion is excellent, and it provides the
finest arc of open dry land on the earth's
surface for launching vehicles into space
or for routine or emergency re-entries
from space. Already, from Woomera,
the deep space tracking station has, over
a period of seven months, continuously
tracked a space probe over 55 million
miles out towards Venus. This equip-
ment and others at Woomera and
around the world will be vital to the
successful tracking of Europa One. The
technical names for the deep space probe
equipment are: “Nominal 960 megacycle
narrow band-pass, phase-tracking, double
conversion, superhetrodyne receiver, con-
taining a data channel and hour-angle,
declination-angle error channels, with a
108 megacycle tracking capability, plus
automatic digital readout and conversion
equipment for rapid serialising and trans-
mission of position and Doppler data,
with telemetry recording equipment for
preserving data received from space
vehicle.”
The music of the universe, heard at
Woomera, is a bleep-bleep which obtrudes
with such regularity that men in the
console rooms keep in step or nod their
heads with its rhythm. But some satellites
moan like disturbed beings.
The advantages of Woomera as the
site for a European man launch have
already been debated and in spite of
the British Government’s opposition to
such a programme it is interesting to
note that 40 senior British test pilots
from the Empire Test Pilots’ School re-
cently attended a series of courses at
the US’s school for astronauts at Ed-
wards Air Force Base, California; that


several RAF pilots have been vitally
involved in the XIS rocket ship flights
and the recently-cancelled Dynasoar or-
bital aircraft project. Woomera’s ad-
vantages are six: (1) it is the only
land range available to the West which
is secure; (2) it has a well-trained aero-
space crew ready for the work; (3) it
has all the necessary tracking equipment;
(4) the air is free of electromagnetic
interference associated with high den-
sity populations; (5) security is assured
—it cannot be penetrated by land, and
it is beyond the range of spy aircraft or
radio surveillance; (6) its weather is
reliable and predictable, it has port
facilities only 100 miles away, and is
connected to a main railroad. Its dis-
advantages are: (1) it is too dependent
for its finances upon the British missile
programme, which is often errant, ill-
conceived and badly financed; (2) its
geographical location is such that it can-
not take full advantage of thrust implicit
in the earth's rotation to achieve the
most desirable orbit for an astronaut—
an equatorial orbit. This can be resolved
by: (a) developing a space vehicle
capable of kicking itself into equatorial
orbit from a west by north launch or
(b) the creation of another spaceport,
dependent upon Woomera for its backup
facilities nearer the equator.
Since Blue Streak is the most powerful
rocket yet to be fired from Woomera
the attitude of the homesteaders has
become one of the first importance. The
rangers and their wives have become used
to seeing rockets popping like hand-
grenades in the crystal clear skies, of see-
ing a Canberra bomber pilotless jet being
blown out of the skies by a Bloodhound
anti-aircraft missile. The homesteaders
are now equipped with shelters. Thirty
have been built at a cost of £2OOO each;
a massive structure the size of a
Nissen hut, padded with concrete, insu-
lating material and sandbags. They are
being used as haysheds, meat-houses,
recreation rooms—rarely for the purpose
for which they were built. They re-
ceive regular information on firings and
the progress of the countdowns so that
they can take shelter if they want. But,
said a homesteader at Mt Eba, Woomera
has come to represent to them nothing
more than a high-flying fireworks dis-
play.
Rapid expansion
¥IfooMERA expanded rapidly as did its
equipment, manufactures, person-
nel. Communications direct to London,
Washington and Kennedy were estab-
lished. As a by-product of its activities,
medical facilities were established for
itinerant stockmen and Aborigines suf-
fering from such complaints as toothache
and gangrene. A tiny camera capable
of seeing behind itself was built. Com-
puters processing 500,000 facts a day
at a cost of 3d. per unit (against a pre-
vious cost of £2 when manhandled)
were installed with £1 million radar sets
to track the airborne missiles with minute
accuracy. What is almost a private air-
line has been established between
Woomera and Lyneham, Britain, and
Woomera and Adelaide, for the two-
way passage of technicians and scientists.
In all fields of Australian technology and
electronics - non-existent until World
War I progress bounded forward.
The record is impressive.
But, until the arrival of Blue Streak,
Woomera’s future might have been con-
sidered insecure. The British second-
generation missile programme was run-
ning down and no third generation was
emerging to take its place. The only
new project immediately foreseen for the
range was the flight testing of the terrain-
hugging TSR2 bomber and its arma-
ment packages.
Blue Streak was conceived in 1953 as
an operational requirement of the British
Ministry of Aviation. By 1959 a full-
scale model had been built, and it was
first test-fired, anchored to its pad by
great steel bolts, at Spadeadam in North
Britain. The missile, a development of
the Atlas, which carried the first gene-
ration of US astronauts into space, has
now been test-fired 30 times without any
disastrous malfunction. The Australian
Government, with part British and part
Australian capital, started work on the
building of Launcher 6A on the shores
of Lake Hart, a salt lake as large as an
English county, 30 miles from Woomera
village.
A test stand was built on the edge of
a gully 130 feet deep. Then came the
efflux deflector, a tile-coated duct to take-
off the white-hot gases, flames and thrust
of Blue Streak. A causeway and servicing

Tokyo Newsletter
City of Dreadful Night
Overcome by Olympic fever
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Chipped in transit and incarcerated
in a hideous corrugated iron temple
which raised an official French
protest, the Venus de Milo came shortly
before I did to Tokyo last month, the
complacent first foreign VIP arrival for
the Olympic Games in October. Accom-
panied by an anxious Premier and
Madame Pompidou and the French
Foreign Minister, Couve de Murville,
she stood blandly staring at a chattering
or dumbfounded semi-circle of tightly-
buttoned students, beldames tottering on
wedge heels, sleek businessmen and a
shoal of schoolchildren with faces as
brightly scarlet as those of Dutch dolls.
Outside, a few preliminary silk carps
flew for the boy’s festival the following
month, balloons bobbed in a black sky,
and a sudden wind blew away the
cherry blossom in Ueno Park. Not far
away artificial blossoms, horrible in pink
waterproof plastic, clung successfully to
the street lamps from which they seemed
to sprout. A man dropped a bundle of
leaflets illustrating Venus, and among
them, already, were a few handouts on
the Games themselves.
I picked one up as he scuttled off
across the twilight. As you might ex-
pect in this most ambitious of cities,
the boasts were large: this would be the
biggest Olympics of the lot, dwarfing
even Hitler’s extravaganza of the mid-
-19305. So many billions of yen are being
poured into the occasion that the mind
refuses to grasp the figures. At least
150,000 tourists are expected, more
than 22,000 of them packing the enor-
mous and recently remodelled National
Stadium for the opening ceremony over
which the Emperor will preside. The
biggest Olympic Games village in his-
tory will cost about £l4 million pounds
Australian and will house 6500 compe-
ting athletes.
the Games sites, 348 radio broad-
casting and 139 telecasting boxes
will be employed. One hundred fixed
TV camera positions where sound and
pictures can be transmitted will be set
up. More than 1300 cables will be laid
down for transmissions. In addition to
the National Stadium, there are a large
number of other huge buildings, notably
the Komazawa Athletic Stadium with
seating for 27,000 and the National
Gymnasium, with seating for 15,000.
The Olympic Games of 1964 may be a
dream come true for the organisers,
but the event is creating nightmare prob-
lems. With 23 Western hotels and 24
Japanese-style inns the city has no
hope of accommodating in the ordinary
way its 150,000 visitors. Rooms have
been found in nearby resorts like Hak-
kone, Atami, and Yugawara. Rooms in
private houses, company-owned dormi-
tories and youth hostels are all doing
their best. But many people are sure
to be turned away.
In Tokyo itself, the fever is already
on, five months ahead of schedule,
The Games ‘idea” has turned the whole
place upside down: new subway con-
nections, two years in the making,
have torn the heart out of the
city, and streets and pavements, nor-
mally badly laid, have now become
dangerous no-man’s-lands of uneven
wooden planks in which the unwary lady
may find herself wedged by a high heel,
surrounded by hooting traffic, and un-
ceremoniously plucked out by the police.
Every day the local English-speaking
newspaper, “The Japan Times”, the
“Mainichi Daily News’’ and the "Asahi
Evening News”, are full of Games stories
which, during my visit, jostled rave re-
ports on the trade-ship Centaur an
Australia’s exhibits at the Osaka Trade
Fair. Few people can be induced to
talk of anything else. In the Sukiyabas i
Centre, Tokyo’s Piccadilly Circus or
Times Square, yet incomparably more
splendid than either, the lights seenic
even more fantastic than I recalled them
on two previous visits, and no doubt t e
Games fever has much to do with t
I recognised the huge grinning re
haired boy who flashed a thousand >8
bulbed smile from one building, the u
Saturn globe with its whirling sate ‘ ’
the owl whose eyes roll in opposite ir
tions . . . but there were many nl °


bsurd or witty signs to keep them
ompany.
The department stores of Tokyo have
lready surpassed themselves this year in
ie variety of their merchandise and the
uality of their displays. Everything
j rom abacuses to zoetropes can be
? ought in one emporium which offers
. iusic by electric organ, a zoo on the
oof, and a children’s playground where
on cubs are on sale. At the Daimaru
litore, oil paintings were on the fourth
[floor and Korean folk crafts on the fifth,
' ogether with a fine show of warrior
lolls in miniature armor. The Matsuya
| ffered a huge show of pet animals from
ill over the world, while at the Takashi-
Iniya there was a sumptuous exhibition
■iii Greek-influenced French and Italian
narble and bronze. At the Mitsukoshi,
j'ou could see a definite display of
Renaissance antiques, chinaware, marbles
ind folk-crafts, an exhibition of South-
east Asian, African, and South American
arts and crafts, an international flower
.how and Japanese carvings; at the
I vlatsuzakaya, some of the Victoria and
I Albert Museum’s 17th and 18th century
lilverware . . . and the list of splendors
:ould be extended indefinitely.
Nightclubs, hotels and restaurants all
lave English-speaking staffs. Apart from
he major drawback of the world’s most
nfernal central-heating you can sweat
ndoors on the mildest of days most
)f these places are expertly geared to
vestern ideas of luxury, with acres of
! foot-swallowing carpet, discreet lights,
j pastel-shaded lampshades, teak walls and
<excellent supper bands. The Mikado
Theatre Restaurant seats 1000 or more
md puts on a floorshow reminiscent of
| Cecil B. de Mille at his most unbridled,
| concluding with a number in which girls
sail above the audience in cages, plumed
1 e exotic birds. The Golden Akasaka
Represents the summit of ersatz elegance,
with hostesses dripping jewellery and of-
ering semi-literate conversation at astro-
nomical per-hour prices. One nightclub
occupies an eight-storey building, featur-
i 2° a Planetarium, a pagoda, a “Science

Restaurants ran ge from the excellent
ribl (I ; o J meyer,s and Ketel’s) to the ter-

| a L . a ra( hation-and-earthquake-resistant
Hnth of Aztec design and a subter-
ranean shopping centre apparently de-
vised for midget troglodytes.
All this, of course, is tourist stuff,
and so is the cluster of bars—numbered
literally in thousands which surrounds
the Ginza area. The Ginza itself (one
of the great thoroughfares of the world
with its fragile plantings of willow trees,
incomparable shops stuffed with pearls,
cameras and transistors) opens out into
a labyrinth of tiny lanes. These, on the
broken pavements or puddles of slops
thrown out of nearby dwellings, students
bustle in their musical comedy uniforms,
teddy boys with Beatle haircuts palely
skulk, and businessmen from half the
civilised world fend off the touts. Every
inch of the area is alive with movement
and color until the Ginza suddenly (and
surprisingly) shuts up just before mid-
night. The senses are assailed with the
smells of boiling noodles, dust, musk,
urine, and smoke from cramped bars;
the sight of an incredible variety of
faces, ranging from the narrow grey of
an overworked student to the plump
white mask of a sister-boy under a thick
fringe of black hair; the sound of car-
horns, brakes screeching, noodle vendors
shrilling their flutes, touts advertising
girls, birds flapping in cages, jazz and
twist music jigging out of teenage dives,
pachinko machines chittering and ring-
ing, and rain trickling down eaves. More
deafening than Times Square at the
height of the theatre season, more vibrant
than Rome in high summer, the city is
not for the neurotic or the easily exhaus-
ted. In 100 yards, you can see men and
women selling mechanical snakes, frogs,
spiders, miniature taxis and yoyos that
flash red and green lights; a dozen for-
tune-tellers with huge pictures of the
human palm hung behind them, beside
them boxes of paper with flickering
flames inside and brilliant red characters;
old men drawing serpents with one stroke
of a brush; and women selling wild
geese, flapping disconcertingly from
bamboo rails.
Tokyo is permissive, and the great
attraction to many who settle there is
that everything called vice in the West
flourishes unchecked. Misfits from Am-
erica, England and elsewhere arrive,
snatch up jobs teaching English at miser-
able salaries, live in near-poverty and
plunge into the streets at night in a search
for pleasure they could neither risk nor
afford at home. This business of using
the Japanese for kicks often causes
understandable resentment. “The Japan-
ese know full well they are being ex-
ploited in a way white men would hesi-
tate to exploit others at home,” a resi-
dent told me. “They are being used as
an escape-valve. They are not appreci-
ated as people, and few foreigners take
the trouble to learn the language. They
come to feel that to the foreigner they
are merely animals.”
With flats astronomically priced, wages
very low, and Japanese houses cold in
winter, flimsy in rainstorms, and often
primitively equipped for cooking and
ablutions, the hell-bent foreigner certain-
ly pays a heavy price for release from
home restraints. And the so-called air,
with its soot, dust, and choking smells,
is scarcely fit to breathe: this is certainly
one of the unhealthiest cities on earth.
In summer the heat is stifling, far worse
(because of the lack of sea-breezes) than
Sydney’s at its sultriest. And in winter
the skies turn black, snow falls on
smutty streets, and winds turn the blood
to ice.
Back to the wormwood
I>eyond the bars of Ginza, Asakusa
with its strip shows, Shinjuku with
its transvestite dives, the city is a grim
maze of scarcely lighted streets, fortress-
like office buildings or factories alternat-
ing with squalid huts, and a tangle of
telephone wires and hideous advertising
signs. As in New York or Chicago, you
step from the dazzling centre into a
wilderness of miserable suburbs or near-
slums. One night, some friends of mine
from Seoul took me to Sunya, only a
stone’s throw from the pleasure districts,
where drug-addicts and gangsters prowl,
there are no more gaudy lanterns, and
families squat on the pavement. A few
streets away, the lights of Asakusa illu-
minate sex-shows, films which could not
be shown publicly in many other parts of
the world, and crowds swarming eagerly
in pursuit of pleasure. In Sunya, the
lights go out, and you walk at your peril.
Tokyo is not a beautiful city, and it
is too late for the Olympic-mad custo-
dians of this extraordinary place to make
it beautiful. The Japanese ugliness far
surpasses anything Robin Boyd has
charged us with here. This is a greedy,
cruel and ambitious place, which only
gives the foreigner the illusion he is
coming to grips with it by flinging him
its gaudiest treasures. One leaves Tokyo
with a sense of relief, but the city’s
virus never leaves the blood. A return,
another drink of that wormwood, is
inevitable.

A Hunt for the Stag
Tom Jones as a male Cinderella
By BEVERLEY TIVEY

son. Paris Theatre. Sydney.

Roy Boulting. Embassy Theatre.

Come Blow Your Horn. Director, Bud
Yorkin. Prince Edward Theatre.

rpHE change of standpoint in Tony
A Richardson’s “Tom Jones” is start-
ling by contrast with his previous work.
After the deliberate identification with
the underdog of “Look Back in Anger”,
“A Taste of Honey” or “The Loneliness
of the Long-Distance Runner”, Richard-
son has turned to Fielding's great comic
novel which deals, if not exactly with
high life, with the 18th-century squire-
archy and the seedier examples of
aristocratic profligacy.
There are plenty of members of the
lower orders around, of course, but
Richardson seems to assume that period
costumes justify him in treating them as
picturesque caricatures, dirty, dishonest,
endowed with a rough humor and vita-
lity, but always at a remove from the
real people of the story. Maybe this is
just the conviction he has previously
found it necessary to deny so vocally.
I suppose it's always arguable (any-
way it’s always argued about) as to how
much fidelity a film-maker owes to an
original in another medium—play or
novel. One can’t object to cuts, tele-
scopings and minor alterations, and the
treatment must of necessity be altered
to fit the screen technique.
In this sense “Tom Jones” is more suc-
cessful than Richardson's other adapta-
tions—Fielding's sweeping, mobile novel
is far nearer to the film than the plays
and novellas on which he based his other
movies. But the tone of the novel has
been lost. “Tom Jones” in its original
form is not just a jolly romp. Though
not a conscious social reformer like
Dickens, Fielding is a shrewd, though
dispassionate, social commentator.
The only hint of this in the screen
version is in the brutally effective stag-
hunt sequence. Most of the time the
lusty, violent, 18th century is reduced to
a series of merry bedroom adventures
interspersed with fights, chases, pratfalls
and losses of trousers.
The majority of people who see the
picture probably couldn't care less about
poor old Fielding, and there's no deny-
ing that the film is very good fun, with
a lively irreverence and frivolity that is
pleasant to find in the solemn, socially-
conscious English cinema.
As interpreted by Richardson, “Tom
Jones” is essentially an expression of the
masculine dream: the hero is a kind of
rorty male Cinderella who is handsome,
irresistible to women, deprived of his
heritage and finally vindicated and re-
united with his true love. This is no
doubt the private picture almost every
man has of himself, and despite the
robust bawdiness this is as much a piece
of wish-fulfilment as the old Joan Craw-
ford pictures were for women.
It's a thoroughly romantic picture of
the 18th century, though with the spuri-
ous realism of earthy dialogue, well-
designed rags and artistically - applied
dirt; while the original novel, though
picaresque and comic almost to the point
of farce, is completely down-to-earth.
A LBERT Finney, with his virile, com-
monplace good looks, is a splendid
choice for the title role, but his perform-
ance is as shallow as it's cheerful; there's
rarely a hint of the necessary basic hon-
esty and integrity. Similarly, Susannah
Yorke is a pretty and spirited Sophie, but
lacks the charm of the heroine of whom
Fielding said that he hoped his readers
would fall in love with her, as he already
had. Both principals are overshadowed by
the exuberant hamming of old pros like
Edith Evans and Hugh Griffiths.
Richardson s besetting sin of over-
direction is always an irritant: he can
hardly bear to let a scene make its own
impact without jazzing it up with tech-
nical affectations like speeded-up or
frozen action.
John and Roy Boulting, who produced
and directed “Heavens Above!” have
been active, in fact battling, in the rickety
English film industry since the war. Their
line is to cock a snook (often both
entertainingly and tellingly) at the Estab-
lishment in all its guises. But they have
the frustration of trying to function in
a business where financial support is pro-
mised one day, snatched away the next
This may account for the increasingly
waspish tone in the work. In “Heavens
Above!” they spray their satiric bullets
around like a demented machine-gunner
hitting everything within reach—often.of
course, the real target, but a lot of inno-
cent bystanders too.
Every character except the parson is
shown in his most absurd, contemptible
light (and a splendidly professional cast
makes the most of this). In fact the
very fiesh-and-blood warmth of Peter
Sellers’ performance rather detracts from
the impact of the film as a whole. If
you're going to make a comedy in two
dimensions only, a solid figure just
makes the rest look flat and unreal.
The Boulting Brothers’ “Heavens
Above!”, inevitably described as “the
new Peter Sellers’ film”, offers one of
Sellers’ best performances as an embar-
rassingly non-U Church of England
priest who, by mistake, is sent to a
sinecure living reserved for friends of the
Archdeacon. Once there he sets every-
one by the ears by cleaving literally to
Biblical precepts. After an encouragin'
start, the bewildered cleric finds that he
has actually upset the national economy,
and that all his converts have either
rejected or fleeced him.
In “Come Blow Your Horn” the son
of a Jewish manufacturer comes of age
and joins his sophisticated elder brother
in the life of a footloose bachelor. This
inspires comical consternation in the
elder brother, comical ire in the parents,
comical gaucherie in the boy. Finally
the elder brother marries the one “nice
girl of his acquaintance —the one who
resisted his blandishments —the parents
are mollified, and the young brother is
free to sow his wild oats before, pre-
sumably, marrying a nice girl too.
Frank Sinatra, ageing and unenthusi-
astic, and Tony Bill, very youthful anJ
over-enthusiastic, are adequate as the
brothers.

pily, still decked in the club colors and
still waving his wooden rattle. But the
sight of Cyrenne removing her dress
with business-like efficiency sobers Percy
with a sudden jolt. His Dutch courage
evaporates and he prepares to flee. And
there, it would seem, the play must end,
ten minutes after it has begun.
But Percy remains and the play goes
on. Very little actually happens. The
telephone rings a couple of times and
a quite unbelievable brother of Cyrenne's
appears for a few minutes and reproaches
her for her way of life. Otherwise, the
stage is left to the two central
characters. The ensuing dialogue is like
a very gentle, very unsophisticated ver-
sion of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?” As the evening wears on and
the level of whisky in the bottle gets
lower, Percy and Cyrenne reveal their
problems and their fantasies.
Percy’s problem is simply that he is
terrified of women. He treats them as
though they were made of the most
fragile porcelain, or, in Cyrenne's case,
high explosive, and does not dare to
touch them. Cyrenne has a sense of
humor and, charmed by Percy’s blushing,
schoolboy prudishness, enjoys making
blunt remarks to tease and shock him.
This situation allows for some gentle,
even idyllic, farce. But the playwright
is not content to leave it at that. He
insists on “explaining”, but, unfortu-
nately, at the level of Dorothy Dix.
Percy’s adolescent pimples lasted for
ten years. Cyrenne had to serve spa-
ghetti in her stepfather’s cafe. She was
also raped by her stepfather. One or
both of these trials turned her to prosti-
tution.
Urged on, apparently, by a desire to
make his characters seem more “real”,
Charles Dyer succeeds only in making
them seem more and more improbable.
Whereas Edward Albee really does turn
a searchlight on the characters of “Who’s
Afraid” and exposes their fantasies and
illusions, Charles Dyer shows clearly that
he is unwilling to probe deeply. But, by
trying to fill in their backgrounds with
broken homes, adolescent inferiority
complexes and such-like cliches of mod-
ern psychology, he does his best to ruin
a couple of promising comic characters.
Percy survives best and provides an
excellent opportunity for a good actor,
as John Meillon’s performance shows.
Whether he is being breathtakingly inno-
cent or disarmingly candid or giggling
and blushing at some perfectly innocu-
ous anatomical reference, John Meillon’s
Percy seems entirely convincing.
June Salter catches very well the
tough, cynical Cyrenne of the throw-
away remark, but she does not manage
the “little girl lost” aspect of the charac-
ter so well. But this would seem to be
the fault of the dramatist rather than
the actress.
Anyone who leaves his fireside on a
cold night to see a production as ama-
teurish as Theatre 60’s of a play as
amateurish as “A Circus Has More
Tents”, could be forgiven for swearing
lifelong loyalty to television thereafter.
Although it is a good idea to encour-
age budding authors by staging their
plays in small theatres, it is necessary
to apply some standards. Mr Fried-
lander's play will need a lot of re-writing
before it deserves to be staged.

Tt is sometimes difficult to imagine who
A is likely to buy records in which one
has no personal interest. These are two
albums evidently intended for specialised
popular markets. The Hans Albers will
clearly be an important item of aural
nostalgia for our German migrants, but
“Valentino Tangos” is something of a
puzzle.
Played with as much fire as the Victor
Sylvester Orchestra on an off night, the
lover of genuine Latin-American music
wouldn't stay with it beyond track one.
Perhaps it will find an audience amongst
those gentle souls who get their musical
kicks from Guy Lombardo and his
Royal Canadians. I can only suppose it is
aimed at the ballroom dancers, but who
would want to dance 11 tangos in a row!
Intended for a German-speaking pub-
lic, “Unser Hans Albers” was a mystery
to me until a friend translated the sleeve
notes. I must confess I had never heard
of Hans Albers, although it appears that
he is extremely well known to his
countrymen.
He was a favorite for many years in
German films, specialising in “love ’em
and leave ’em” sailor roles with some
Chevalier-like comedy and singing on the
side. Towards the end of his career, an
autobiographical recording was planned.
Before the project was completed, he
died during a stage performance in
Vienna in 1960 and this memorial album
had to be put together in a more frag-
mentary fashion than was intended.
Some of the songs, I am told, recall
the gay and bawdy atmosphere of the
Tingel-tangel ” (fun fair and low music
hall) and the Reeperbahn (Hamburg's in-
famous street of sin); “Auf der Reeper-
bahn nachts um halb eins” which, freely
translated, means “On the Reeperbahn,
1.30 a.m.” and “Komm auf die Schankel
Luise ’ (“Come on the swing, Luise”).
A title I should like to investigate f ur .
ther has been interpreted by my friend
as “Do keep your feet still, my boy”.
Another Albers is revealed in sea chan-
ties like “Take me with you, captain, on
your journey” and “Little white seagulls”,

Assemblages
Colin Lanceley. South Yarra Galleries,
Melbourne.
HThe Art of Assemblage has been known
A to Melbourne gallery goers since
1952 when Barry Humphries organised
the “First Pan-Australian Dada Exhibi-
tion” in the Union building at the Uni-
versity. The seventy items in the “Dada-
logue” of the exhibition were more
notable for their Merry Andrew humor
than for their merit as art, and
Humphries in subsequent exhibitions en-
couraged people in the habit of laughing
at assemblage.
Lanceley's work has a young man's
verve and the rarer quality of assurance
that results from a complete understand-
ing of the craft of picture-making. The
titles of the pictures indicate themes that
are sometimes important and occasional
pictures have pertinent literary values.
“Altar"’, having in its centre panel a
gambling machine, can be read as a
genre painting, granted its Sydney origin.
Lanceley's method of picture-making
suits him. Assemblages may be new in
Australian painting, but this form has
a history going back to 1913 when, as
Apollinaire noticed, “You may paint
with whatever material you please, with
pipes, postage stamps, postcards or play-
ing cards, candelabra, pieces of oilcloth,
collars, painted paper, newspapers,” and
Duchamp made a three-dimensional
assemblage by mounting a bicycle wheel
on a stool.
Lanceley uses a method of equa
values of paint and assemblage in his
pictures. Until very recently, the objects
or fragments he used did not w'ho}
retain their own values, but ranked a:
areas, color-tones, textures and lines unti
the picture became familiar. Only the ll
did these multiple notes spell out t eii
messages, tins, toys, beads, etc.
Most recent works contain a pl a h
between flat areas and three-dimensiona-
elements; jutting shelves, sloped P an£ _
and large objects that take on
obsessional importance. There are
some sculptural assemblages that 0
employ paint. One of these, 10

fying work. It results from the ar >

MUSIC
Songs of Praise
International Society for Contemporary
, Music Concert. Cell Block Theatre,
| Sydney.
J'VTigel Butterley’s “Laudes”, which
r was performed at the first of this
! year’s series of ISCM concerts, is the
jfirst work produced by this composer
i since his return from overseas. Scored
for eight instruments, it has four move-
i ments, each bearing the name of a Euro-
pean church. According to Butterley,
“each movement has behind it the image
,of a place, and is intended to be a song
of praise in the context and spirit of
that place.”
The aims of “Laudes”, then, are fairly
conventional. Not entirely conventional,
though. The aim of a lot of nineteenth-
century music was to evoke in the lis-
tener a response correlative with the
response the listener was supposed to
have when confronted with the phe-
nomenon represented by the music. In
Laudes”, however, Butterley aims at
producing the correlative in sound of the
four churches considered as acts of prais-
ing God; that is, at praising God in
sound in the way that the churches
praise Him in stone and wood.
I am not sure how one should assess
utterley’s success in his aims. It is,
owever, clear from the first perform-
ance of “Laudes” (to the extent that
anything can be clear from a first per-
formance) that Butterley has produced
ol >r striking and sharply differentiated
movements, each with its own character-
ise aural quality.
The third movement, “King’s College
a Pel, Cambridge”, is especially impres-
-7’ Ca Pturing very well the autumnal
am of English Reformation architec-
ture.
How durable the music is, is impossible
say a f ter only one hearing. One matter
Butt i° e f ,‘ nv ‘ te comment, though, is
jj . er e y s instrumental writing. Much of
i pointillistic, using the instruments
m 0 state bodies but to provide frag-
ni • S °L SoUn d which together form the
ino ' C , s of instrumental writ-
's alwa Y s a Pt to sound gratuitous
j Us t 1^. never sure why the composer did
he o * S at s P art icular time, or why
of th Ve S ° ni - e P^ rase to the piano instead
e clarinet; though perhaps these
questions are not very important when
the composer has not set out to emulate
Webern's close attention to the formal
considerations that can be used to gov-
ern instrumentation. But in the case of
“Laudes”, the pointillistic writing seem-
ed to me to have been done rather more
by guesswork than the writing in the
non-pointillistic sections. Compared with
the sure handling of, for example, the
trumpet solo in the third movement,
and the alternate wind and string chords
in the second, the beginning of the first
movement sounded rather amateurish
as if the composer had to some extent
trusted to luck when scoring it.
This, however, does not detract from
the fact that “Laudes” is an impressive
piece of music, well deserving a wider
audience. It is regrettable that the per-
formance was not recorded for possible
future broadcasting.
One composer who does not need to
trust to luck is Felix Werder, born in
Berlin and now living in Melbourne.
Werder’s sixth string quartet, also played
at the concert, exhibits the same compre-
hensive and assured technique as was
displayed in his orchestral “Mono-
strophe”, conducted in Sydney last year
by Tzipine. The quartet makes use of
almost every trick of the string-player’s
trade, and is, as one critic noted, prob-
ably the most demanding quartet
yet written in Australia. It is
demanding on the players not only as
individuals but as a group, for it calls
for (and generally got, from the Austral
String Quartet) very accurate en-
semble work. Despite all this, the quartet,
like “Monostrophe”, lacks content. Like
some of Hindemith’s works, it goes most
convincingly through all the motions of
making music, without ever persuading
the listener that it was written out of
conviction or necessity. It does not, as
some of Hindemith’s works do, sound
lacking in invention quite the con-
trary but the net result is about the
same as if it did. I look forward to
hearing a work by Werder that is, in
the requisite sense, more significant than
either “Monostrophe” or the sixth quar-
tet.
The highlight of the concert was a
performance of Schoenberg’s “Pierrot
Luniare”, given by soprano Marilyn
Richardson and an instrumental ensem-
ble directed by Richard Meale. This was
one of those rare performances where
the musicians are in complete accord with
one another and with the music. Mrs
Richardson showed that she is no longer
a promising young singer but a mature
and accomplished artist, and Meale that,
despite his lack of conducting technique,
he has the most important qualities of
a fine conductor. It was a performance
in every way worthy of the music.

Our Difficult Neighbor
A mechanistic nightmare?
By PETER HASTINGS
Indonesia. Bruce Grant. Melbourne
University Press. 32/6.
T>ruce Grant’s “Indonesia” is a cool,
intelligent, introductory study to
the basic problems and facts of our
northern neighbor for anyone who
wishes to inform himself dispassionately.
Mr Grant is a respected journalist in
this country and abroad, and for some
years worked in and out of Singapore
for “The Age” and “The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald”. In fact most of the chapters
in this book are based on news and
features which Mr Grant wrote at the
time.
He knows Indonesia at first hand
and has met most of its leaders including
those of the PKI. He has a great
sympathy for Indonesia as a country and
for Indonesians as charming, colorful,
vital people. But neither his sympathy
nor his interest have led him to any
degree of optimism about the future.
He regards Indonesia as an eastern-style
dictatorship in which democracy can
now have only the slimmest chances of
reasserting itself.
Soekarno he regards as increasingly
dictatorial, more and more addicted to
ignoring even the minimal demands
made on him by Indonesian constitutional
processes or even those traditionally
imposed by the processes of gotong
royong and musjawarah. While there are
loyal, intelligent and influential Indo-
nesians who disagree with Soekarno
and many who violently oppose his
policies as nationally disastrous they
are now fewer in numbers partly through
despair at being unable to influence the
course of events and partly through
the national Indonesian madness that to
get it you've got to be in it, that is, that
to share in the spoils you have to be part
of the madness.
However, Soekarno is certainly not a
dictator in the Hitlerian sense either in
his personal tastes (he is inclined to be
kindly, hedonistic and fun loving) or in
the apparatus of personal power. He
presides over solid forces delicately
balanced against each other. He main-
tains his position through the competition
of the Army, the PKI and the other
political parties, groupings and elites for
Presidential approval. None at this stage
can afford to risk losing power and pres-
tige by openly fighting among them-
selves. This gives him a particular free-
dom especially in the fields of national
solidarity-making and in foreign policy.
He can also securely operate from a
basis of Indonesian nationalism one of
the mainsprings of which, after 300 years
of Dutch colonial rule followed by war-
time Japanese occupation, Dutch police
action and civil war, is a deep, ineradi-
cable suspicion of foreigners.
Other attitudes flow from this —fear of
encirclement, a hatred of colonialism in
all forms, and a determination to create
out of 3000 islands 100,000,000 diverse
peoples (many of whom are culturally
and ethnographically foreigners to each
other) a united nation.
The common denominator of Indo-
nesian unity is the universal experience
of Dutch rule. It may seem a flimsy
basis for national unity in the face of
the archipelago’s diversity and centri-
petal tendencies, but it has nevertheless
proved the cement of Indonesian unity
which has withstood a number of
calamities including the Sumatra and
Suluwesi rebellions of 1958.
Tt seems one of the great misfortunes
A of history that while Soekarno, and
perhaps only Soekarno, could weld a
united nation out of such a bewildering
diversity, he is almost oblivious to the
tasks of creating a rational economy for
his suffering people. Indonesians, as is
well known, live for the most part in one
of the world’s most beautiful areas. It is
also one of the world richest which
is going rapidly down the drain economic-
ally, It is a fundamental economic obser-
vation that in the technological age the
rich, developed nations grow richer and
the poor, underdeveloped nations grow
poorer. Given a continuation of the pre-
sent style of Indonesian leadership, at
the end of this century there will be more
than 200,000,000 Indonesians on a very
poor standard of living. What happens to
them?
Indonesian nationalism could grow
more sophisticated and its dynamism turn
inwards towards the tremendous tasks of
raising the economic, cultural and social
standards of living of the Indonesian
masses. This seems very unlikely. The
political parties and the Army have too
great a vested interest in their own share
of the spoils to give up what they rightly
regard as theirs. A number of economic
reforms have foundered on this simple
fact. No one in Indonesia in a position
of power is prepared to give up his slice
of the cake. The Indonesian masses could
turn against their rulers. This also seems
unlikely.
Politically docile, used to being gov.
erned, living in a semi-paradise even
though food, bicycles and biro pens are
in increasingly short supply—it seems im-
possible that they could be sufficiently
organised to take action against the now
formidable apparatus of power owned by
the leadership. Perhaps it could happen
if the much-heralded showdown between
the Communist Party (torn itself between
Moscow and Peking in an anti-Chinese
country and having large elements of
national Communism within its ranks
and among its political allies) and the
Army should take place. This is highly
speculative.
It is probably more likely that in the
event of Soekarno's death (not too far
away, probably; he is old for an Indones-
ian and has lived hard) the Army and
the PKI might join in an uneasy alliance
of power and share in the spoils while
seeking peaceful means of extending their
influence a situation of stalemate. As
Mr Grant remarks, the PKI has shown
signs of becoming in some ways a con-
structive political force which is a dan-
gerous thing for a revolutionary party.
There is also the possibility of frag-.
mentation, that Sumatra might seek to
attach itself to Malaysia or that Suluwesi
might seek to go it alone, with external
aid. In the face of the Republic’s history
and its nationalist fervor this seems un-
likely without provocation, subversion
and even military aid from foreign
sources, which could prove a highly
irresponsible policy for those espousing
it as a means of settling the Indonesian
question. As Mr Grant rightly says,
directing his remarks to some of the
hopefuls in Malaysia, fragmentation of
Indonesia could very quickly result in
hungry, overpopulated, Left-wing Java
becoming another Cuba.
Fragmentation could also arise from
the policy of Confrontation getting out of
hand or becoming a suicidal gamble. Mr
Grant’s view is that Confrontation is
composed of many elements, fear of
encirclement, fear of being fragmented,
fear of foreign influences, and so on,
but that it is also a calculated tactic in
Soekarno's policy of forging a national
ideology and identity. If this is so, and
Mr Grant will have plenty of critics
for his point of view, it brings a cer-
tain relief.
If Confrontation is not more than a
tactic in brinkmanship, its use at any one
time and place implies certain dangers,
but the ultimate danger that its sponsors
mean exactly what they say is at least
removed. On Mr Grant’s view, Aus-
tralia will probably get its full share of
Confrontation thrills, especially in New
Guinea, which will be highly vulnerable
to political subversion and wide open to
guerrilla-type operations.


Nelson’s Eye
Who Lost an American? Nelson
Algren. Andre Deutsch. 31s.
il/HO Lost an American?” is a col-
" lection of previously-published
essays, random thoughts and spasmodic
invective lumped together with some
bridging material in loose adhesion. The
resurrection of old magazine articles is
a useful device for authors between
books or passing through a “dry” period,
but it is almost invariably unsatisfactory
for the reader. The wide variety of
styles in the several segments of this
volume bear witness to the fact that
they were tailored for magazines as
Averse as “The Kenyon Review”, “The
Atlantic Monthly” and the men’s maga-
zines “Playboy” and “Rogue”.
Any expectant reader influenced by
the book’s claim to “being a guide to the
seamier sides of New York City, Inner
London, Paris, Dublin, Barcelona,
Seville, Almeria, Istanbul, Crete and
Chicago” is headed for a major disap-
pointment. These places are indeed
covered, but the hard-boiled chronicler
of life’s victims in “A Walk on the Wild
Side” and “The Man with the Golden
Arm” now seems intent on building a
reputation as a nonsense writer. Un-
fortunately his emerges as a rather fey
imitation of this very exacting art in
chapters with titles such as New York:
Rapietta Greensponge, Girl Counselor,
Comes to my Aid; Paris: They’re Hiding
the Ham on the Pinball King or Some
Came Stumbling; and Almeria: Show
Me a Gypsy and I’ll Show You a Nut.
Algren is at his best when he writes
in straightforward fashion about what
he knows and he induces some nostalgia
for the Chicago of his youth, long gone
and now replaced with the conformism
of mass culture. His attack on mid-
-Oth-century mores, particularly in four
chapters on Chicago, is often penetrating,
ev en though it lacks subtlety (he
tends to vacillate between clown and
vestigial social scientist). His assess-
ment of the Playboy Club phenomenon
as institutions where one can indulge in
the vicarious enjoyment of sex without
'he responsibility and obligation of per-
sonal involvement reduces them to es-
se ntials and his background gives him a
tidiness of approach to “a carnie-talk-
*B evangelist named Graham” and the
e gro writer James Baldwin whom
Algren evaluates far more realistically
, an critics who have excessively praised
him. .
„ ® u t if Baldwin can be censured as a
Professional Negro”, Algren is open to
criticism for “professional anti-Ameri-
idrHsm”. He wales into American mass
Attire and the mass media that pro-
bates it, the American abroad (trans-
planted unaltered from East Jesus,
Kansas) and a variety of individuals
from “New York Times” book re-
viewer Orville Prescott to Clare Booth
Luce. His criticism of American values
is a somewhat superficial examination
of surface manifestations, but it is notice-
able that he uses a different set of criteria
in dealingjvith the French group of Sar-
tre, Camus, de Beauvoir and others who
are his friends. The personal glimpses he
gives us of these noted literary figures
and their associates are especially inter-
esting because of his intimate knowledge
of them.

The Magic Pudding. Norman Lindsay.
Angus and Robertson. 255.
great kids’ stories of the world, of
which “The Magic Pudding” (re-
published earlier this year) is unques-
tionably one, are usually found, on
closer examination, to enshrine a myth,
or legend, which gives an inner reality
to their outward fantasy. And since
“The Magic Pudding”, first published in
1918, has been reprinted no less than
sixteen times, we may pause to enquire
what is the underlying vision of Austra-
lia'' which Norman Lindsay, consciously
or otherwise, has presented to so many
generations of his young countrymen.
The first thing we notice is that this is
a man’s world. It is true women figure
in the ballads interposed throughout the
story —it would even seem Sam Sawnoff,
the penguin, has once courted one —and
that subsidiary female characters like
Mrs Dobson Dorking, the bumptious
Rooster’s laundress wife, make occasional
fleeting appearances. But otherwise, the
atmosphere is exclusively masculine.
Heroes, villains and the dramas of their
confrontation are all male, and women
are hardly even referred to in their con-
versation.
The next thing that strikes us is that
nobody does anything —or hardly any-
one. Bill Barnacle and Sam Sawnoff
have long retired from the sea, Bunyip
Bluegum is an idler (or “Gentleman of
Leisure”, as he puts it), and even
the Possum and the Wombat don’t ap-
pear to have any gainful activity except
for trying to steal the puddin’ Albert.
At rare moments we may meet a minor
character like Henderson Hedgehog the
Horticulturist, or Benjimen Brandysnap,
the canine market gardener, but in
general the impression is one of a
glorious and perpetual smoke-oh.
Then how does everybody live? The
answer is they live on Albert, the eter-
nally self-renewing Puddin’ who, in the
economy of the book, is a sort of one-
man (or puddin’) universal provider.
Albert, of course, is not a pleasant
character —he dishes out insults as often
as succulent slices of himself but he
does sustain everyone, all the same. So
would it be fanciful to divine in Albert
the symbol of the burgeoning Welfare
State?
And what of the chief characters—the
three Puddin’ owners? Bunyip Bluegum,
whom we must take to be the hero—.
since Lindsay sub-titles his book in
Bunyip’s name —is in reality, despite his
b,eing “a very well-bred young fellow”, a
bit of a middlebrow poltroon. He wears
a bow tie and straw hat, carries a cane,
impresses the simpler Bill and Sam by
his somewhat pompous verbosity (he
has “read all the best Australian poets”),
and hides shamelessly behind his friends
whenever the trio are in danger. He is,
in fact, despite the book’s rural setting,
a sort of urban Savage Club member of
the epoch, and we may fairly take him,
I believe, to be Lindsay’s prophetic vision
of the cosseted crypto-suburbanite that
was already outnumbering the outback
characters of Bungledoo and Tooraloo
who form the background to the story.
When we come to consider his mates
Bill Barnacle and Sam Sawnoff, I must
reveal a theory that will shock pro-
foundly every Australian reader. And
this is, that Bill and Sam are not Austra-
lians at all, but Pommies! I base this
fell conclusion chiefly on a textual
examination of their speech, for Bill,
in particular, will be found to speak a
sort of W. W. Jacobs stylised East Lon-
don—he drops his aitches and g's, and
sticks aitches on in the wrong places—
in addition to which, in all their accounts
of their earlier voyages, there is no men-
tion at all of their having ever sailed
from Australia. It also strikes me as
significant that Sam is not an emu, say
(there is no emu in the book, by the
way, and only a glimpse of a kangaroo),
but a bird from the Antarctic. Why!
Even Albert —that embodiment of the
recalcitrant Aussie temperament —is not
even, strictly speaking, an Australian
either, since we learn that he was created
on an iceberg off Cape Horn. However:
let my native readers be reassured. For
if it be true Bill and Sam are not Aus-
tralians, then the further startling dis-
covery that they are murderers need not
trouble the national conscience. For
there can be no doubt about it: despite
their indignation against Puddin’ Thieves,
Bill and Sam initially got possession of
Albert by pushing his creator, the cook
Curry & Rice, into the ocean.
And what of those arch villains, the
Possum and the Wombat? There can
be no doubt, in this case, as to their
nationality: they embody the Aussie
scrounger, and though Lindsay clearly
likes them if only because of their
dogged persistence—l think we may take

them to be his radical notion of the
small capitalist parasite. He makes
them, for instance, in one of their inter-
minable plots to capture Albert, dress
up like Collins Street bankers of the
period and cry, when challenged, “Top-
hats are sacred things.” We may also,
in this connection, notice Lindsay’s
equivocal attitude towards the Law. The
famous court scene, in which conven-
tional justice is turned upside-down with
hilarious result, is a splendid satire; but
at the same time the pugnacity of Bill
and Sam is frequently inhibited, through-
out the story, by their nice observance
of legalistic procedure: for example,
when reaching Watkin Wombat’s Sum-
mer Residence, Bill regrets that “not
bein’ burglars, we can’t bust the door
in.”
What more is there to say? Only
perhaps, that “The Magic Pudding” re-
mains as fascinating, after a hundred
readings, as it was to me when I first
opened it forty years ago. What a happy
world this is of bush and endless sum-
mer, a perpetual diet of meat, suet, jam
and billy tea, a sockdolager on the snout
to solve every problem, and where
beasts and humans are so convincingly

Fontana Books. ss. 6d.
Hanbury White was a com-
paratively young man when he died
this year (he was born in 1906).
“Camelot was based on his book “The
Once and Future King’’, a re-telling of
some of the Arthurian legends. A seg-
ment of those legends is the basis of
“The Sword in the Stone” which, in this
version (more or less), has become a
Disney extravanganza. White shows
King Arthur wearing pyjamas, going
hunting with Robin Hood, fighting
the Anthropophagi and learing about
dogs from Flavius Arrianus.
the Magician, his main supporting
character, was born “backward” in
time so that his future was anyone
else's past, and vice versa. These
science-fiction additives lose their point
when it becomes clear that all White’s
characters are subject to the vagaries of
an unseen time-machine. The protago-
nist has an additional faculty, that & of
undergoing a change into a bird, an
animal and a reptile. This device gets
full use. It gives a full illumination,
too, to T. H. White’s private enthusi-
asms. As a member of the British Fal-
coners’ Club it is not surprising that he
has his main character, unhooded, spend-
ing a night in a hunting mews disguised
as a merlin, listening to the exploits of
the other hawks —and at some risk to
his skin. In fact, all the raptors—the
hawks, owls and eagles express their
opinions in slightly archaic English. The
protagonist spends a little time, also, as
a snake, and rather more as a fresh-
water fish, which seems to point the
direction of Mr White’s other enthusi-
asms.
There is a danger in this licence,
Since humor depends upon the measure-
ment of divergences from the norm, the
author's establishment of a norm so
wildly expansive reduces the impact of
his situations. The humor that depends
upon anachronism frequently sounds
juvenile.
Very often White has difficulty main-
taining his precarious footing on the
knife-top edge of the fence between thel
precious and the quaint.

mortality rate in small and specia-
list magazines seems to have de-
clined somewhat, but with “Art and Aus-
tralia” one feels the question of survival
is still a nagging one. The most recent
issue was quite late in appearing, and this
is just the Sort of thing that saps confi-
dence.
Still, once on the stands, it looks sub-
stantial. No one interested in the field
need regret their thirty shillings. The
articles on individual artists Albert
Tucker, by Robert Hughes, and Tom
Roberts, by Verginia Spate are solid
and authoritative. Contemporary artists
probably are the best subjects for a quar-
ry of this kind which aims to document
the current period, and Hughes’ piece is
an excellent example; but the fresh and
precise approach of Miss Spate to Tom
Roberts’ painting is a valuable contribu-
hon to the understanding of the local
traditions as well as an index of advance
ln critical techniques.
Janies Mollison's careful and percep-

the series of survey articles, but is I find

Jewish
Perspectives
Perspectives. Vol. 1. No. 1. Published
by the Jewish Labor Bund. 2s. 6d.
HPhe Bund, otherwise the Jewish Socia-
list Party, was founded in Russia
in 1897. For the first twenty years of
its existence it was larger and more
important (unless you define import-
ance in terms of subsequent success)
than Lenin’s party and it was prominent
in the deadly infighting which charac-
terised Left-wing politics in Czarist
Russia. After the revolution its strong-
hold was Poland and it played an honor-
able part in the resistance to Nazism.
Nowadays, centred in America where
nearly half the world’s Jews live, it leads
a quieter existence. It still stands, as it
always has, for democratic socialism and
a cultural pluralism which will allow
secular Jewish culture to survive and
perhaps thrive; but to some extent events
have passed it by. The creation of the
State of Israel and the decline of anti-
Semitism on the one hand, and the loss
of vitality on the part of democratic
socialism on the other, have weakened
its appeal and made the alternative
“solutions” to the Jewish problem
Assimilationism and Zionism more
attractive.
But the founding of this new journal
is evidence that the Bund still retains
some of its vitality. The editor, Dr
Emanuel Scherer, denies that we have
reached “the end of ideology” and claims
to detect a reawakening of interest in
politics and political ideas. “Perspec-
tives”, he says, is intended particularly
for the young intellectuals who are dis-
satisfied both with the status quo and
with Utopian ideas and who are con-
cerned with the quest for “identity”.
In practice this first issue is divided
between articles on Jewish questions and
ones on democratic socialism. The latter
are innocuous and unoriginal and their
level will have to be improved if “Per-
spectives” is to make a serious contribu-
tion to socialist thinking. The main
interest of this first issue lies in those
articles which spell out the Bund's posi-
tion in relation to those of other Jewish
organisations (“Approaching the Jewish
Problem”, by Scherer, and “The Bund
and Zionism”, by B. Meyers) and those
which deal with aspects of Jewish cul-
ture (“Yiddish and the Intellectuals”, by
Jacob Milner, “The Essence of Jewish
Laughter”, by A. Shulman).
On the evidence of this issue, “Per-
spectives” is too sectarian and too lack-
ing in intellectual sophistication ever to
be a rival to the excellent “Commen-
tary”, but its honest concern with
expounding a democratic and pluralist
position deserves support.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Plea for Critical Lending
YlTith the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Coombs, urging
" a more restrained growth in Australia, and the Retail
Traders’ Association of NSW reporting that Sydney shoppers
bought more retail goods on credit than for cash, there was
a fluttering in the financial dovecotes last week. Finance
company shares were marked down on the Exchange and
bankers hastily expressed the hope that the Reserve Bank was
not going to use the trading banks as brake linings.
The doctor evidently is telling the patient not to over-reach,
particularly in the wrong direction of easy credit. After the
recent economic recovery, of course, the shortage of skilled
labor has become more apparent and the liquidity build-up
has created a chronic fear of inflation.
Part of the reason for the “overstrain” now reported in the
Australian economy is the strong push given by Government
spending, following the direction last year for Government
departments to get out and spend and sop up the unemployed.
Extra funds were granted to the States by the Common-
wealth and, with loan money rolling in thick and fast, the
authorities were not worried unduly if their spending was com-
peting with private enterprise for men and materials. Now
that the expansion has accelerated (and vehicle registrations
reached a new record in April), the authorities are realising
that further heavy spending on their part could put too much
strain on available resources.
Dr Coombs seemed a little worried about the impact of
hire-purchase during times of rapid expansion and no doubt
he was keeping in mind the recent evidence of bad paper
written in the competitive scramble for finance business.
The Treasurer, Mr Holt, was reported as saying that the
volume of hire-purchase relatively was not high, especially
when compared with the US.
All things are true enough if kept in perspective, but if
Dr Coombs follows up his admonition to the hire-purchase
companies that “we must be prepared to slow down”, there
could be further official intervention.
If it takes the form of further restrictions on the banks, it
leaves more business available to the finance companies.
So Dr Coombs has pleaded with them to be more critical
in their lending, to ask for larger deposits and shorter repay-
ment periods on hire-purchase contracts.
Australians Are Nice
Fellows, But...
Judged on subsequent comments, Mr N. Amaya, Commercial
Consul for Japan, stung quite a few people with his speech
at the recent “Japan-Australia Profit Partners” seminar in
Sydney. He said he did not want to cast stones when
expressing his personal opinions on Australia. But his remarks
were treated in some quarters as politely tossed rocks, with
particular publicity given to his references to “excessive pro-
tectionism”, “discrimination against Asians” and “limited
understanding of the problems of developing neighbors”.
When kept in perspective, however, his thoughtful review
of Australia’s position today as a thriving neighbor of Japan,
Malaysia, Hong Hong, US and Mexico is worth considering
as a fresh and authoritative opinion of a Japanese who, with
a strong commercial and economic background, has had the
opportunity of studying Australia at close quarters for two
years. If any of his remarks are unpalatable, then we should
forget our thin skins and see if we can extract any value from
his criticisms.
Raising our heads from the sand and looking at a new
and vital world developing north of Australia, it is an invi-
gorating thought to note that Mr Amaya compares Japan and
Australia as two nations which have undergone a modern
industrial revolution in an effort to chase the industrial giants
like Britain and the US.
He reminds us that the average Japanese thinks of Australia
as a big country with a small population which doesn’t want
Asian immigrants; that 87 p.c. of Australia’s working force is
in the non-agricultural sector and that, after 60 years of high
protection policy, we have not yet succeeded in creating an
Australian industry which dares to face the world of competi-
tion outside Australia. The last comment is a quotation from
Dr B. M. Niculescu, of the University of Melbourne and,
although Mr Amaya thinks it a bit harsh, he still chides
Australia that any rate of tariff in excess of say 60 to 70 p.c.
ad valorem is, generally speaking, too protective.
TTe says that Australia is keen only to sell in Asia. But an
equally important problem is how and what to buy from
Asia. Leaving Japan aside, he says that Australia has the
economic structure to create large export surpluses with
densely populated Asian countries like Communist China (now
Australia’s fourth best customer because of recent windfall
wheat sales). But Australia’s industrial structure lacks the
adaptability to meet the pressure to buy secondary products
from a “cheap labor” country to meet trade imbalance.
He suggests Australians should become more acquainted
with Japanese products, technology and capabilities and more
sympathetic toward the problems facing such a good customer
as Japan. Doubtless here he is referring to Japan's own
balance of payments problems now that she has accepted
obligations as an Article 8 country of IMF.
He recognises that Britain and the US have a big start and
a tradition of long-established interests in Australia, besides
the facility of a common language.
But, posing the obvious truth that Australia and Japan must
develop together for mutual advantage, he does not believe
the difficulties are insurmountable for Japan to sell Austra-
lia machinery, chemicals and other sophisticated goods.
Mr Amaya pats us on the back as the country of tomorrow
but, like a polite, silky-haired terrier, he sinks his teeth and
hangs onto his main point—Australia should buy more from
Japan. On figures, he is right.
At the same time he warns that Australia, because of her


“import replacement industries”, may only be able to develop
trade with Japan on the same pattern as Australia’s trade
with Britain over the past century, where Australia supplied
the primary products and Britain supplied the manufactured
goods. He suggests Australia should try to become less reliant
on import replacement industries.
Secondary industries must gear themselves to world compe-
tition, become selective, dynamic, and supply cars, special
steels, bearings, electric machines, metal-working plant and
chemicals, such as small-sized countries like Sweden, Holland,
Switzerland and Austria are selling to Japan.
Boom in Euro-dollar
Business
of US overseas loans caused by the 15 p.c.
interest equalisation tax has prompted three US banks
to set up shop in London to take advantage of Europe’s
buoyant loan market. Business is good enough to offer around
4i p.c. for call money and 4} p.c. for three months deposits.
The latest influx will raise the number of US banks in
London to 12, still only a relatively small contingent in the
169 international banks represented in London, which include
32 branches of British overseas banks.
International bankers see plenty of scope in London because
the London clearing banks traditionally are restricted to
unattractive fixed deposit rates
of 2 p.c. less than Bank Rate
and a lending rate which usually
is only marginally higher than
Bank Rate.
With plenty of expansion of-
fering in Europe’s buoyant
economy, the overseas bankers
see plenty of pickings. Especially
is this so in view of the British
Treasury’s anxiety to curb inter-
est rates on loans, a policy which
is unlikely to be altered by the
election of a Labor Government.
The British merchant banks,
of course, are not so conserva-
tive and are actively competing
with US and other foreign banks
in lending Euro-dollars, some of
which is suspected as a method
of getting round the interest
equalisation tax.
Sterling deposits of US banks in London doubled in 1963,
and are rising rapidly . . . another important contribution to
the US balance of payments.
Company Quarterly Reports
Trickling Along
The Company Quarterly Reports section of the Melbourne
Stock Exchange’s April issue of the “Official Record” is
the biggest it has been since it originated in July of last year.
Nine companies are included in the section. The previous
best figure was seven in last December’s Part One issue and,
before that, five in the original July issue.
Although nine companies cannot even be considered as a
handful, the trend to the issuing of quarterly reports to keep
shareholders more fully informed is definitely upwards. In
the current decade there will be a limit to the number joining
the list, as many firms find the service uneconomical and
too time-consuming. In fact, it could be many years before
An article on the Australian floorcoverings industry begins

imports during 1963-64, yet local manufacturers generally

quarterly reports become the accepted thing, if they ever do.
Several firms still do not release interims.
The stock exchange's official opinion on the matter was put
forward in March last year by Mr D. S. Rogers, the former
general manager, at the inaugural meeting of an investment
lecture series conducted by the Hobart exchange and the
Adult Education Department. He said quarterly reporting
was encouraged by the Stock Exchanges but held the view that
it must come mainly through evolution.
Steel Price Rises Take Place
in World Context
|>HP’s latest set of price increases appears to have been
effective since March, though it took a parliamentary
question to the Minister for Trade and Industry to bring
the changes before public notice. Even so, their exact appli-
cations are hard to discover.
That some rises were probably on the way became fairly
evident in the company’s late-February supplementary report.
The chairman, Sir Colin Syme, there drew special attention
to the continuous climb of costs, only able to be partly held
by higher output. “The weight of cost increases now being
absorbed by the industry is considerable,” he remarked. So
the signs were on the wall.
Actual price increases, the first major ones since 1959, at
present apply to plate steel and
merchant bars. It is widely
believed, however, that struc-
tural steel must soon join the
advance.
February’s report spoke of
strong markets for plates and
merchant sections, then signi-
ficantly mentioned a particularly
high demand for structural sec-
tions having to be fully satisfied
by some imports. The company
can “relieve” this situation when
the new Whyalla structural mill
goes into commission.
Australia's prosperous domes-
tic economy need at this
moment suffer no great hard-
ship in absorbing these specific
price rises, fundamental a com-
modity as steel is. Any wide-
spread cost-push seems somewhat alleviated, because the
alterations do not apply to sheets for John Lysaght nor to
BHP's direct sales to motor vehicle and appliance makers.
The increases also appear to be reasonably small as one
result of BHP having to take strict cognisance of export
conditions. Differential costing and all, there the price trend
looks markedly the opposite. Indeed Sir Colin noticed this
in February: “In the field of exports, competition continues
to be intense and the pressure on prices severe.”
Internationally, steel now lives in quite a ferment. With a
considerable surplus of productive capacity over demand,
charges of price cutting and dumping are legion. Out authority
speaks about the international steel trade being transformed
“into a bargain basement for metal consumers.”
Generally buoyant industrial growth within the leading
maker and user countries USA, Britain, Japan, Canada and
the Common Market does begin to suggest that some of
the more extreme import pressures may soon disappear.
Nevertheless, the European Coal and Steel Community is
taking no chances. It is pressing for a world conference of top
steel-producting countries to discuss stabilisation. Any world
agreement would inevitably concern BHP.

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Puzzle of Private Investment
Capital spending is not really hanging fire
"Evidently we are not supposed to
read too much into the poor per-
formance of private investment in the
March quarter, because in his address to
the National Credit Instalment Confer-
ence last week Dr H. C. Coombs hinted
strongly that private industrial expansion
has warmed up from its “until recently
modest rate of expansion”.
However, it is worth examining the
figures for that quarter, if only to demon-
strate how far capital spending by indus-
try fell well below expectations and
needs to buck up this quarter to get back
to the promising rising course of last
year. What we must not do is to infer
that investment is continuing to lag as
in the March quarter, nor imply that the
figures for that quarter throw doubt
on the wisdom of the monetary authori-
ties’ moves to edge up interest rates —an
implication which certainly seemed to be
justified on the showing of the March
quarter before Dr Coombs’ address last
week.
Indeed, the March figures for capital
spending by industry were not the only
evidence from the national investment
scene which prompted doubts about
the trend in investment, because the
Treasury Bulletin for April showed there
was also a sharp recoil in public invest-
ment outlay in the same quarter. Com-
pared with the March quarter 1962-63,
total expenditure from loan funds drop-
ped from £l2l mill, to £96 mill. —all of
this being accounted for by a reduction
from £lO5 mill, to £BO mill, in loan allo-
cations to the States for capital works
and housing. However, these figures
defy interpretation, since they largely
reflect payments to State Governments
and not necessarily actual expenditure
during the period by the States.
to private investment, al-
though the figure was not issued until
April 24, the Commonwealth Statisti-
cian's estimate that “anticipated new
capital spending by industry (covering
80 p.c. of the field) in the January-June
period this year would be an all-time
record of £305.7 million, certainly gave
rise to expectations that the figures for
actual spending in the March quarter
would be considerably higher than
proved to be the case. In the event,
actual spending in the March quarter
turned out to be only £124.5 million,
or 40.5 p.c. of the anticipated figure for
the half-year to June. This percentage
compares with one of 45.7 p.c. for the
previous March, which seemed to con-
firm the suspicion that the Common-
wealth Statistician’s anticipated expendi-
ture had been pitched too high. At any
rate, as spending in the latest March
quarter was only £2 million more than
in the same quarter last year, it could
hardly be suggested private investment
was running strongly enough to warrant
an increase in interest rates.
Against this, the fact that new capital
spending in the March quarter was very
much lower than for the December
quarter’s £149.7 million is perhaps not
so significant in itself. For seasonal
reasons, spending in the March quarter
is invariably lower than in the previous
December quarter. However, the drop
between these two quarters this year was
much more pronounced than in the two
previous years. Between December and
March quarters 1961-62 the drop was
£18.6 million (from £126.4 to £107.8
million); last year it was £16.6 million
(from £138.9 to £122.5 million). This
year it was as much as £25.2 million
(from £149.7 to £124.5 million).
TTsually “actual” expenditure comes
out pretty near the Statistician’s
figures for “anticipated” expenditure,
though the proximity varies from period
to period. For instance, in the July-
December half-year, 1963, the anticipa-
ted figure was £296.1 million against an
actual of £283.2 million, a difference of
£12.9 million. In the previous six
months, January to June, 1963, the dif-
ference between anticipated and actual
was only £3.8 million. The question is
whether January-June this year is going
to show a similar small difference
between actual and anticipated as for the
same period last year.
It can be taken from Dr Coombs’
latest remarks on private investment that
the gap will be much narrower than
could be inferred on the basis of the
actual figures for the March quarter.
To get near Mr Archer's estimate of
£305.7 million for expenditure in the
period, a huge lift in spending by indus-
try would be needed.
In fact, to close the gap actual new
capital expenditure by industry would
have to rise to £181.2 million in the
June quarter, whereas the most spent in
any single previous quarter was £149.7
million (in the December quarter, 1963).
In taking their recent action to lever up
interest rates, maybe the authorities were
acting in face of evidence that a recovery
of this dimension was taking place in
new capital spending by industry. Also,
they may have had evidence that this
recovery set in well before the end of
the March quarter.
Nobody will envy the authorities their
task of keeping tabs on the level of
industrial capital expenditure. In the old
days, new issues of capital on the stock
exchanges provided a pretty good guide
to the trend. Now, even though stock
Exchange prices are very little below
their all-time high, issues of new capital
have been few and far between this year.
They have not been much more fre-
quent this quarter than last, when only
£20.1 million, the lowest quarterly total
since 1957, of new capital (shares, de-
bentures, registered notes and deposits)
was raised by stock exchange listed
companies.
TAr Coombs has obviously not been
deceived by the scarcity of new
issues on the stock exchanges or the “re-
latively weak demand for loans so far”.
He pointed rather to “the flow of funds
from abroad into industry and commerce
and the accumulation of substantial in-
ternal funds by companies” as supplying
the bulk of industry’s new capital re-
quirements. Even so, equally clearly he
is expecting a strong revival in new
issues. “It seems likely,” he stated, “that
with the increase in private (capital)
expenditure and with some restraint on
the growth of liquidity, there is likely
to emerge a marked increase in the de-
mand for loans —suffice it to say that it
is essential that this demand should not
be met too easily or uncritically.”
All this gives the lie to any inference
from the March figures for capital
spending by industry that private invest-
ment is hanging fire or that the authori-
ties have been misinterpreting the private
investment scene in their moves to lever
up interest rates and put a brake on
capital spending. Dr Coombs put it on
the line that there was a danger of pri-
vate investment over-reaching itself, say-
ing, at one stage, that he hoped the rate
of growth in capital spending would
now flatten out and, at another, “if we
are to avoid an increase in costs and
prices it is desirable that we adapt the
rate of increase in expenditures to fit in
with the possibilities”. As for the growth
possibilities, he said the availability of
resources set a limit to Australia’s growth
rate and, while this limit has varied over
the years, it was now around 4 p.c.


“CROESUS”
Who Will Bell the HP Cat?
Mr Ricketson skirts the main problems
Tt is incredible that, on the highest
authority, here we are with our
sights raised towards another boom and
nothing has been achieved since the last
one to bring the activities of the non-
bank finance companies within the orbit
of the same credit controls as the private
banks proper. Nobody can say nothing
was learned in the last boom about the
need to bring all purveyors of credit
under the same umbrella. Of course,
the Government was well aware of the
necessity when it concocted the ill-fated
tax on interest to meet part of the prob-
lem in November, 1960.
True, the tax on interest was not the
answer, not even in a restricted form
applying only to the outside financiers.
We are well shot of it. As for the
recommendations of the Parliamentary
Committee on Constitutional Reform on
the subject, apparently the Government
doesn t consider these are the answers
either, otherwise they would have been
implemented by now.
So, on the threshold of what he sees
as a possibly explosive spending period,
we have the Governor of the Reserve
Bank standing up (bravely, one might
say) before the assembled delegates of
the Credit Instalment Conference and
telling them that he was hoping they
would not be naughty boys like they were
last time when the full pressure was on
national resources. He also gave them
a few tips on how to behave: they should
establish “conventions of behavior”, raise
their standards of assessing risks, look
for shorter periods of repayment and
bigger deposits on instalment credit
business. The “exuberant youth of the
instalment credit industry is over,” he
suggested, and it must settle down to a
more modest role in economic stimula-
tion. But no mention of them being
brought under official credit controls.
Qne can be quite sure of one thing.
Even if member companies of the
Hire Purchase Conference might perhaps
be expected to behave with a full sense
of national responsibility at a time when
HP business needed to be restrained in
the interest of alleviating the pressure
on scarce resources, the large number of
finance companies outside the Confer-
ence cannot be relied on at all.
In fact what is needed is some hard
and fast rules that all finance companies
would have to obey, such as official
regulation of the scales of minimum
deposits, maximum periods of repay-
ments, maximum charges and the like.
If the authorities had been more vigilant
of the national interest, they would have
sought to get such regulations imple-
mented on a national basis long ago.
Australia is one of the very few countries
where HP is allowed to be a nuisance
and take both the monetary authorities
and the public for a ride.
It is therefore a pity that Mr Stani-
forth Ricketson, who has long been a
champion of banking reform, should, in
his latest broadside against the inequality
of treatment between the two banking
systems, show himself more interested in
getting a fair go for the banks rather
than the adoption of the sort of controls
on the hire-purchase and other finance
companies that would make them con-
form more closely to national credit re-
quirements as seen by the monetary
authorities. He is not advocating that
the finance companies should be con-
trolled, simply that the private banks
should be given “a greater freedom of
action and control over their assets” on
the assumption that this “would go a
long way towards preventing the deve-
lopment of speculative financial opera-
tions outside the banking system”. He
does not support this assumption with
argument but simply states it. Perhaps
on some future occasion he will attempt
to justify it.
Tn fact, Mr Ricketson's main aim
would seem to be to remove
controls from the banking system so the
private banks can make bigger profits,
rather than put controls on the finance
companies in the public interest. Hence
his tilts against the Reserve Bank, which
are seen not only in his strong criticism
of the well-timed restraints imposed on
the banking system in the last few months
but also in the following statement, as
made last week to shareholders of Jona-
than Investments Ltd, one of the Capel
Court investment companies of which he
is chairman:
“For too long,” said Mr Ricketson,
“controls over Australian banks have
contained an element indistinguishable
from direct profit control. This attitude
now appears to have been extended to
operations in the short-term money mar-
ket. The ideal of a Reserve Bank being
the father of the financial system as
was the case with the Bank of England
is an achievement not yet reached in
the development of the Reserve Bank
in Australia.”
Mr Ricketson also quoted a hand-
picked passage from the recent Canadian
Royal Commission on Banking report in
support of his plea for more freedom
for the banks. The excerpt from the
report runs: “We have favored a more
open and competitive banking system,
carefully and equitably regulated under
uniform legislation but not bound by
restrictions which impede the response
of institutions to new situations.” Mr
Ricketson said the reasoned and liberal
approach towards the functions of the
banking system followed by the Royal
Commission could be studied to advan-
tage in this country.
r\NE can understand Mr Ricketson
being in favor of that, if only be-
cause one finds in the report such plums
as a recommendation to remove the ceil-
ing of 6 p.c. on chartered bank loan
charges and another to permit the banks
to lend freely in the mortgage field. Yet
one also notices the report is critical of
the Canadian security markets. It recom-
mends stronger policing and listing re-
quirements and fuller disclosure of in-
formation by companies, as well as
suggesting the establishment of a Federal
regulatory body to oversee the security
industry. The establishment of a securi-
ties commission here wouldn’t please
many Australian brokers.
Further, some of the other recommen-
dations in the report would seemingly be
restrictive of the private banks. For
instance, it is suggested that gentlemen’s
agreements on interest rates and lending
policies between the banks be discour-
aged. Another recommends that compe-
tition in investment between the banks
and “near” banks (that is, hire-purchase
and trust companies and the like) be
restricted. That is rather the antithesis
of what the banks presumably want in
Australia. Perhaps the most revealing
part of the report Concerns controls over
the “near” banks themselves. It recom-
mends that, excluding credit unions and
savings banks, these should be made
subject to Bank of Canada monetary
controls, just as is needed in this coun-
try. But when are we going to get this
here?
The report is indeed worthy of our
study to see how the Commission pro-
poses Canada should bell the HP cat.
Finally, another of the Commission’s
recommendations, but on a different sub-
ject, is worth noting by Australian
Governments. It proposes that acquisi-
tions of shares in Canadian banks by
overseas interests should require the
approval of the Canadian Treasury
Board. This proposal, it is suggested,
could provide a system whereby acquisi-
tion of interests in other Canadian com-
panies by foreigners could be regulated
by the Canadian Government. Why
don't we try this too? Or are we all
asleep to foreign exploitation of our
resources?


Expansive Future for Floorcoverings
The threat from imports not considered serious
Producers of floorcoverings in
Australia, despite keen internal
and external competition, feel they
face a secure future. They believe
that easier credit schemes for fur-
nishing and the Federal Govern-
ment's promise of easier finance
for home-building give weight to
their argument that the industry
will continue to expand and some
have plans in hand to increase their
plant facilities. Rising costs of both
raw materials and labor have
affected margins but expanding
demand has offset this. Executives
The Bulletin interviewed said
imports would have to be lowered.
IThe growing Australian floorcoverings
industry, beset with ever-increasing
raw material and labor costs, is con-
vinced its future prospects cannot be
anything but prosperous.
Figures referred to in an earlier
Bulletin story on furniture indicate that
Australians spend about half as much on
floorcoverings as they do on furniture.
Of the £116.5 million spent in 1963 on
furniture and floorcoverings (a figure the
Commonwealth Statistician does not
break down) about £37.5 million was
spent on floorcoverings while the bal-
ance of £79 million was spent on furni-
ture, according to the NSW Guild of
Furniture Manufacturers.
The Australian floorcovering industry,
roughly divided into four sections: car-
pet, linoleum, felt and vinyl, faces com-
petition both at home (from other manu-
facturers and other forms of floorcover-
ing) and from abroad. The feeling in the
industry is that local competition will
continue at its present strength while
competition from overseas may be les-
sened by Australian manufacturers pro-
ducing lines which are at present im-
ported.
Recent developments in the floorcover-
ing industry, such as vinyl, have made
inroads on the more traditional cover-
ings, but companies feel that these have
not been too great and are confident they
can maintain their share of the market.
One of these companies is Michael Nairn
and Co. (Aust.) Ltd, linoleum and vinyl
manufacturer, whose managing director,
Mr W. G. Hill, says that although other
floorcoverings have taken an increased
share of the market, linoleum will main-
tain it present share of the market.
“Our sales and production for the
latest quarter are down a little on the
previous corresponding period because
there are so many floorcovering mediums
on the market at present,” Mr Hill said.
Tle said Nairn’s, which has the giant’s
share of the Australian linoleum
market, was more concerned about out-
side than local competition. “We act as
agents for our parent company, Michael
Nairn and Co. Ltd, of Scotland, who ex-
port to Australia lines we cannot pro-
duce here. As far as we are concerned
they do not export to Australia lines
which will compete with those already
manufactured here. They make one lino-
leum in particular called patterned inlaid
and the whole of Australia’s requirements
of this type are imported.
“It is uneconomical for us to produce
this line here. If we were to put in the
plant to make it we would have to pro-
duce for overseas markets to make
money. At the moment we do very little
for export but we hope to expand this
in the future.
“European manufacturers provide
our main competition here and although
the Japanese have not moved in here
they probably could.” Mr Hill said total
sales of linoleum in Australia were not
changing. “The sales of different types of
lino are changing but overall sales are
remaining steady. This is because of the
introduction of vinyl which is taking the
increased market which would have gone
to linoleum.” If the market for smooth
floorcoverings was not growing then lino-
leum’s market would be falling.
The largest share of the Australian
market for 21 million square yards of
smooth floorcovering a year was taken
by felt-based linoleum with total sales of
between eight and nine million square
yards a year. A survey of the total de-
mand for hard or smooth floorcoverings
up to 1975 undertaken recently by the
University of Melbourne shows that de-
mand for marble and inlaid, felt-based
and printed linoleum will remain virtu-
ally static, while the demand for vinyl
and vinyl asbestos floorcovering will grow
by more than 60 p.c.
Mr Hill said one of the basic raw
materials for linoleum production, lin-
seed oil, had been going up in price in
Australia while it had been going down
overseas. “We buy all our linseed oil
from Australian producers. The price
is about 70 p.c. higher than it is over-
seas but because of the protective tariff
on imports we can’t import any cheaper
than we can buy locally. We are the
largest single user of linseed oil and the
largest single producer of paint for our
own purposes (for printed linoleum) in
Australia.
“Another raw material for lino, cork,
has also been increasing in price recently.
We import ours from Spain and Portugal.
We could land it in Australia before the
war for £2O a ton, but now it costs
£7B a ton. We pay approximately three
times as much for cork as Continental
countries.
We make the body of linoleum, wood
flour, ourselves from sawdust sup-
plied by Australian sawmills. But this,
too, has been going up in price. About
the only thing that has come down in
price is resin which, because of over-pro-
duction and over-capacity, is still coming
down. Overall our costs are definitely
up.”
Nairn’s had a growing share of the
Australian floorcoverings market until
the November, 1960, credit squeeze,
when import restrictions were relaxed,
Mr Hill stated. “We went to the Tariff
Board in 1962 to get protection on
linoleum and they gave us an extra li
p.c. to raise the duty to 25 p.c. We
don’t think it’s anywhere near sufficient
and the Government won’t put back
import restrictions. Something should be
done because overseas manufacturers can
produce at a lower cost than we can.
For instance, wages in the UK are up
to 90 p.c. lower than they are here.”
Soft floorcoverings (carpet and felt)
had taken some of the linoleum market.
“With freer money in Australia at
present and the credit systems it has
become easier for the home-owner to buy
more expensive floorcoverings. We are
the second highest users per capita of
linoleum in the world using about 1.8
square yards a year compared with New
Zealand, the highest, which uses between
1.9 and 2 square yards a year.
“The future of the linoleum industry
in Australia is a matter of new effects in
lino. There are many types of floor-
coverings available at the moment, but
if you are going to hold your market
you have to come forward with some
new effects. In America, for example,
all lino manufacturers closed up and
produced vinyl. Now they have opened
up again to produce lino but with dif-
ferent effects, and it is almost impossible
to distinguish it as lino. We think the
market will continue as it is now,” Mr
Hill added.

the Australian soft floorcoverings market,

Carpet Manufacturers Ltd, said. “This
figure is too high and we expect in the
future that Australian-made soft cover-
ings will eventually take 85 p.c. of the
market with the remaining 15 p.c. being
supplied by specialty imports which
cannot be made here.
“At present Australia imports carpets
from practically everywhere in the world
with Belgium and the UK the main
suppliers. Japan, New Zealand and
America also supply the Australian
market. In fact there are not many
countries which do not export carpets to
Australia.
“I don't think imports will grow per-
centage-wise—they could lessen a little
because the Australian industry can take
care of its own requirements and will
expand. And the retailers themselves are
waking up to the fact that buying locally-
made goods is better business. There will
still be imports for what I call the snob
trade the specialty carpets but this
will lessen.”
Mr Rowe said there had been “a bit of
a price war” in the Australian soft floor-
covering industry with the introduction
of nylon-wool blend carpets to compete
with the more popular all-wool carpets.
He said the blend (80 p.c. wool, 20 p.c.
nylon) comprised only about 5 p.c. of
Carpet Manufacturers’ business.
“It would seem that this particular
blend had not been as popular in Aus-
tralia as some people expected. Because
it is still a relatively new product on the
market it is hard to tell what the future
holds. In America, where these carpets
have been available for some time, Cali-
forian housewives prefer the all-wool
carpet. Very little blend is sold. And yet
on the east coast the blend is very
popular.”
/Competition in Australia was very
keen because of the number of manu-
facturers engaged in the soft floorcover-
ings business. “Because of the large
number of producers there is a lot of
over-capacity and that is another reason
why we have to cut down on imports.
The floorcovering situation in Australia
is that lino is losing ground while carpet
is making it up.”
Cost of raw materials for carpet manu-
facture had been steadily growing over
the years, Mr Rowe said. All but 3 p.c.
of the wool used was imported from all
over the world. Only 3 p.c. Australian
wool was used because its fine texture
was not suitable for use on a large scale
in carpets. “Prices have shot up —in
some cases there have been rises of 100
p.c. We import our hessian from Scot-
land and India and prices have been
very high because of rises in the price
of jute.
“The only thing that has remained
stable in price overseas is cotton, but
local people have had to put their prices
up because of increased costs. The
future of the soft floorcovering industry
in Australia is quite bright. The reason
for this is that the average Australian
is wanting his own home and facilities
for getting homes are improving. Aus-
tralians are becoming more comfort
conscious with wall-to-wall carpets be-
coming more popular every day.
“The time will come when nearly all
carpets are wall-to-wall and there will
be very few carpet squares being used.
Carpet trends in America at present will
eventually come here. One of these is
carpet in classrooms which is a huge
success in the States because it makes
the room quieter and warmer and keeps
the children quiet. Another use we will
see here is carpet in hospitals. Already
Australians are realising the use of
carpets in public places for instance,
hotel bars,” Mr. Rowe remarked.

MARKET POINTERS
About That Slow-down
Tf the Commonwealth and State Gov-
A ernments slow their spending in the
housing and public works area, the out-
look may not be so buoyant for some
of the engineering, building and con-
struction groups.
But a moment’s thought brings the
realisation that the Commonwealth and
State Governments are committed for
extremely heavy annual expenditure as a
normal course of events. A cut back in
loan allocations would be relatively
small, and, in fact, the loan programmes
of necessity have been rising each year
to take care of natural population
increases.
There is no doubt that more money
needs to be spent in educational areas,
as well as on roads and other vital
national development projects.
To a certain extent, therefore, govern-
ment competition for men and materials
is hard to avoid.
So those investors who plumped for
basic materials producers in the past
should have no cause to alter their opin-
ion for the long term.

Tf Dr. Coombs of the Reserve Bank is
so concerned about the need to slow
down, it is obvious that he is preoccu-
pied with the dangers of inflation. His
plea to the hire-purchase companies to
write strong contracts with larger
deposits and shorter repayment periods
emphasises that the hire-purchase groups
do not come under Reserve Bank con-
trol and, if the banks are being squeezed,
the finance companies could undo the
credit restraints by providing alternative
loans at higher interest rates.
Again, in the face of steady progres-
sive expansion of the Australian econ-
omy, the pointer is towards cost increases
and inflation.
With too much money available for
investment and not enough suitable
share scrip to go round, the market
could enjoy a strong underpinning.
But what of the measures to restrict
the incipient boom? If these are too
restrictive, the share market could take
a dim view.

A lthough local companies evidently
are not raising much money for
investment in capital assets (based on
March quarter figures) there is no doubt
that overseas companies are riot hesi-
tating to pour money into Australia.
Hence the further pressure of liquid
funds competing for available assets. Re-
newed activities in mining and oil
exploration suggest a revival of share
market interest before long.
who spent many hours

opinions when Swallow & Ariell got the
boost.
The usual thing is to pick a reasonably
successful company so that if no take-
over eventuates, the investor is not left
holding the bag.
But Swallow, which wasn’t doing so
well, was neglected by most of the mar-
ket operators.
And who would have thought that a

Seems like the sick stocks which are

The Big Day Approaches?
Australian Biscuit and public listing
When will the Australian Biscuit Com-
" pany turn public? This is a question
on which there will be much specula-
tion until the big day finally is nomina-
ted by directors. One thing is certain—
J. B. Were & Son, the Melbourne stock-
broking firm which has been handling
the company’s dealings, will increase its
business from present clients and a surge
of new ones once investors feel that an
announcement is imminent.
Of course, this assumes that Were’s
will be handling the float but, again, this
fact is a foregone conclusion as the two
have been associated for some time now.
A parcel of ABC shares at flotation
price (which will undoubtedly be bur-
dened with a premium of at least 100
p.c.) could prove very lucrative for many
years, or at least until Nabisco bites off
a sizeable piece of the Australian biscuit
market. When the American group sets
up its own plants, it must be prepared to
lose money in the initial stages as a top
quality, low-priced biscuit (a very rare
commodity) seems to be its only chance
if it hopes to break the ABC’s virtual
monopoly.
Mr G. A. Arnott, the chairman and
managing director of the ABC, has said
that a public issue is “expected to take
place within two to three years, and
possibly sooner if the offer for Swallow
and Ariell Ltd is successful”. There are
two reasons which lead to the belief that
“sooner” will have to be sooner than
Mr Arnott thought when he made the
statement.
In the first place, the statement was
made in the earlier stages of the bidding
battle, when the total cash layout was
only in the vicinity of £1 million. Now
that the ABC is to pay out a sum of well
over £1 i million —70 s. for the 47-odd
p.c. of scrip it did not buy on the market
at prices up to 81s. 6d.—the drain on
whatever its source of funds will be
much heavier. The board undoubtedly
desires more cash to take up the profit-
able investments it had to forgo by
buying a loss company.
ABC listing should also be accelerated
by last week’s announcement from
Nabisco’s American parent that a mod-
ern biscuit plant would be built in Aus-
tralia “as soon as possible”. The ABC
could make good use of the cash from a
public float to compete with the new
plant, whose products will undoubtedly
attract great attention in the initial stages
at least. For this reason flotation could
be at the same time as Nabisco's plant
starts producing.
Nabisco has high chances of success,
backed by the parent’s research, develop-
ment and marketing know-how. If this
success materialises, then the value of
the ABC’s £ll million protective insur-
ance will be questionable. This line of
thought was highlighted in last week’s
announcement when Mr F. Gurgone, the
vice-president of the National Biscuit
Co., said they “bid only to a point where,
in our opinion, it was economically
sound”. Continuing: “Once this point
was reached, we permitted ABC to ac-
quire a controlling interest in Swallow
and Ariell and sold to them our hold-
ings”. In other words, Mr Gurgone
apparently feels the ABC’s acquisition is
economically unsound and there is every
chance that he will be proved correct.
The attitude of the Stock Exchange of
Melbourne to the whole skirmish was
not altogether protective for shareholders
and some investors, although certain
stockbrokers were not worried because
they were able to collect fat brokerage
fees all the way through. At the height
of the battle, prices touched 81s. 6d.

in a matter like this—suspend trading
until some final settlement is reached.
It should alwavs be realised however
It should always be realised, however,
by removing a free market, shareholders
cannot take advantage of high prices,
particularly if the takeover offers are
withdrawn. But, in this case, the battle
of the giants (including some reported
“short” selling) was hardly a genuine
market for shareholders or investors.
The Stock Exchange hairs apparently
remained completely unruffled despite all
the “trading in the dark” and severe cri-
ticism from many quarters. Perhaps the
Exchange was basking in the publicity
as well as the broking fees. The room
where Swallow shares are quoted was
packed with reporters, radio newsmen
and the glaring lights of the television
newsfilm team and a Melbourne paper
splashed a story and pictures all over
the front page on the crucial Friday.
Good to remind the public that for-
tunes can be made, provided the public
gets the benefit!
Reports of shorting at around 80s. on
that Friday and buy-backs at around
60s. on the following Monday leave
many lingering doubts.
Rewarding 34 Years’ Patience
"VTot a very well kept secret was the
mammoth capital move planned by
Cresco Fertilizers Ltd, of Adelaide.
The shares jumped 7s. to 775. in a
fortnight. On May 13 the managing
director denied market rumors of a
bonus or an investment in the company
by ICIANZ.
Reason for the buying on the market
turned out to be a placement with a
“large life office” and a subsequent one-
for-five issue of 20s. shares, to both
preference and ordinary shareholders, all
at 60s.
Total issued capital leaps to £939,798,
of which £110,965 is in preference
shares.
No doubt the life office received a
fuller explanation of what Cresco would
do with the £619,899 raised than share-
holders generally, who were told it would
be used "in the general development
planned by the company”.
How exceptional was this development
is illustrated by the fact that this is the
first capital move of any kind for 34
years.
New capital will rank for the full
year's dividend in 1964-65. Directors
expect to maintain 9 p.c. on the greater
capital. (Last year’s earning rate was
25 p.c.)
The Commonwealth Government pro-
vided in the 1963 Budget for a bounty
of £3 per ton on superphosphate, cheap-
ening its cost to the user by some 20-25
p.c. Since then, producers have laid
plans for increasing production facilities
to meet the increased demand. (The
Government estimated an immediate in-
crease of 20 p.c.)
It will be interesting to learn of
Cresco’s precise plans.
No Problems for Piet
fpHE worthiness of taking a very close
look at some shares in newly-formed
Piet Ltd, first suggested in The
Bulletin’s investment section of May
16, has been supported by the very
healthy outlook which the company’s
prospectus for the public float reveals.
Dividends of 15 p.c. are predicted—one
of the highest rates ever for a new listing
—and these will undoubtedly bring on
heavy over-subscription despite the 3s. 9d.
premium on the ss. shares.
The prospectus shows that earnings
have grown rapidly since 1960. The
investigating accountants have adjusted
the results and, expressing them on the
proposed £300,000 of capital (£120,000
before the float), they come out at 9.3
p.c. in 1960-61, 12.9 p.c. in 1961-62 and
19.6 p.c. last year. The directors
expect that earnings in the current year
will be in the vicinity of 27.5 p.c. and
they back up their estimate with the
announcement of a £48,000 profit in
the seven months to January 31 after
tax at public company rates.
Several other factors augur well for
the favorability of an investment in the
company. Net tangible asset backing is
calculated at 7s. lOd. on each share.
However, total fixed assets are actually
well below their true market value in the
prospectus. For instance, motor vehicles
have been depreciated at a higher rate

than that allowed by the taxation regu-
lations. More important probably is the
freehold item —all properties are inclu-
ded at cost except for a small land write-
up in 1951.
Factors such as this leave scope for
asset revaluations and the building of
reserves in future years. These ultimately
lead to some benefit for shareholders.
The cash raised from the public issue
will most likely find most of its use
during 1964-65, when increased output
is planned. This must lead to higher
profits, assuming the increased produc-
tion is sold, and to an earnings rate on
the float capital of somewhere around
30 p.c. Very healthy indeed!
Milne Browne Receivership
/Ane of the largest creditors, Direct
Acceptance Corporation Ltd, which
has a floating charge over the assets,
appointed a Receiver and manager to the
old established Milne Browne and Co.
Ltd.
Milne Browne reported late in Febru-
ary that it had made a profit of £3984
for the December half-year, although it
lost money in the three previous full
years.
The company was originally a dental
and optical supplier, and wholesale
jeweller. It was, however, bitten by a
common bug in the boom and purchased
land at Cardiff and Forster in NSW for
subdivision and resale.
The dental supply department was
sold to F. H. Faulding in 1963, for
£65,000.
Issue Details from Conkey
Shareholders as at June 30 will be
entitled to the one-for-eight par
issue originally announced by NSW meat
wholesaler, Conkey and Sons Ltd, in
February of this year. The issue raises
capital by £20,000 to £lBO,OOO.
A purchase at 15s. would average
down to 13s. lid., and the yield on
a continuing 11 p.c. dividend becomes
just under 4 p.c. The ss. shares are
about Is. 9d. cheaper than when this
issue and a share placement were
announced three months ago.
Aided by Subsidy
TUith £143,644 worth of assistance
from the Tasmanian Government,
King Island Scheelite (1947) Ltd made a
profit of £28,414 for the year to Octo-
ber 31, 1963.
This compares with a loss of £8440
in 1962 and a profit of £103,054 in
1961.
The company had not previously re-
ceived a subsidy, which was granted
because of the social problem of unem-
ployment on the island if the mine had
to close down.
The world market price for tungsten
fell to 575. 6d. sterling per long unit in
July, 1963, before recovering to 755. by
the end of the company’s financial year.
KIS ss. shares are currently valued
at around 10s. 6d. on the principal stock
exchanges of Australia.
Bare Bones of Aust. Factors
A report on the statement of affairs
from the Receiver of Australian
Factors Ltd (Mr A. D. Bridges) shows
that a provision of £585,000 stands
against book debts of £2,068,743.
Whether the net £1,483,743 is realised
depends on the results of legal actions
against many debtors, their capacity to
pay, and the validity of the book entries,
Mr Bridges says.
The realisable value of shares held in
Australian Factors (Victoria) Ltd, which
is still in business, and in Australian
Factors (Queensland) Ltd, which is in
receivership, depends on similar con-
siderations.
The company has a contingent liability
for £253,924 in respect of a lease on


premises at 569 George Street, Sydney,
which can be avoided or reduced by sub-
letting. The Receiver estimated the even-
tual liability on this as only £5OOO.
Subject to these major qualifications,
the Receiver estimates that the company
could have £69,921 surplus for share-
holders, after paying creditors.
Australian Factors’ shares are now
4d., compared with a top price last
year of 15s. 3d., the Queensland com-
pany’s shares are 2id. (9s. 6d.) and the
Victorian company llfd. (10s.).
The Mutual Reconstruction
*The reconstruction planned by Mutual
Stores Holdings provides a pretty
raw deal for the ordinary shareholders.
They will be receiving only one share in
the capital of the reformed company, to
be called “Mutual Stores Freehold Pro-
perty Investments”, for every three they
hold now. However, this scheme is pro-
bably the only way out for them if they
expect to collect a dividend again or see
their present ss. shares move much higher
than their current Is. 7d. on the stock
market.
The company has been moving towards
this reconstruction for about two years.
It has gradually sold all its trading units
so that there are now no retail activities
at all. An unknown portion of the pro-
perty it still owns is rentable and 96 p.c.
of this portion has been let already—it
is expected to be income-producing by
August 1. The main activity now is in-
vestment in “commercial property”.
The new company will be able to invest
with the net proceeds of the stores it has
sold plus its rental income. A loan of £1
million has been made by the Australian
Temperance and General Mutual Life
Assurance Society for a “long term at a
satisfactory rate of interest”; but this will
not be used for investment. The proceeds
will be used to repay all short and
medium term liabilities, which are largely
made up of registered deposit notes, with
the aim of reducing annual interest
charges.
Noteholders will be offered early re-
demption at par plus the face value of
interest to date or, alternatively, the op-
portunity of converting to 7 p.c. notes
maturing in 1971. Last year several
noteholders received circulars from the
company offering early redemption if they
accepted an interest cut for the full term
of the currency as from the original issue
date. As this cut, in one case, was from
10 to 6 p.c., the offer did not receive
very wide acceptance from the issues
which were due to mature soon anyway,
although the longer termed issues of
lower interest gave a better response.
But the directors are making sure that
full acceptance will result this time. They
are very kindly offering par redemption
plus face-value interest —that is the
original rate, due to date. If this offer
or the conversion is not taken up, they
plan to enforce certain terms of the trust
deed to bring about compulsory redemp-
tion in six months. Obviously, the reduc-
tion of interest charges is important if
profits are to be satisfactory next year.
Probably the most important feature
of the new scheme is the possibility it
provides for earning reasonable profits.
Even though a small surplus was made
in the December half-year (when two
retail stores still had to be sold), the per-
centage on paid capital would have been
paltry. But the reconstruction will chop
paid capital back from £1,685,047 to
£561,682. On this basis, any earning rate
on the old capital will be multiplied by
three on the new.
This is why the directors have forecast
that earnings in 1964-65 will be sufficient
to pay a dividend of “not less than 6
p.c.” In theory, the new shares will be
worth ss. 9d. on the market (using the
present Is. 7d. as a guide). Of course,
this depends on the asset backing figure
and exactly what rate of interest is pay-
able on the £1 million, as this figure
determines the annual interest saving.
The Bulletin was told by a company
spokesman that neither of these items
was available for publication.
Aerosols Flying High
A MALGAMATED CHEMICALS Ltd is look-
ing to the recently acquired Parco
Chemical Ltd, which makes aerosol
packs, to contribute substantially to
group profit this calendar and financial
year, Mr J. D. Wilson, chairman, told
shareholders at the annual meeting.
It is not known what price Amalga-
mated paid Kiwi Polish Co. for Parco
last August. Parco was the pioneer and
still is the largest aerosol custom packer
in Australia.
Amalgamated forecasts that the mar-
ket for aerosol packs will multiply five
times in the next six years. If Australia
follows the US trend about half will be
produced by custom packers. Economies
of scale would be expected from such
growth.
None of Mr Wilson's boundless con-
fidence rubbed off on the market. The
shares remained at around 14s. 4d.
Gordon & Gotch Encore
"1/lelbourne based, but universally
known throughout Australasia, Gor-
don & Gotch, the stationer, bookseller,
advertising agent and printing machinery
merchant, is paying another 20 p.c. divi-
dend this year on capital increased by a
one-for-five bonus.
Profit, described as “most satisfactory”
for the year to March 31, was not
nominated in the dividend announce-
ment. Shareholders should not have
long to wait. (Last year the earning
rate was 35.3 p.c.)
At 30s. 6d. the ss. shares return 3.3
p.c.
More Crumbs From Tooths
Tnstead of the expected £ p.c. dividend
A increase this year, Tooth and Co.
Ltd lifted dividend by f p.c. to 14i p.c.
in respect of the year to March 31.
This must hasten the day of the next
bonus.
Email’s Prospects
chairman of Email Ltd (Mr E.
G. F. Horne) in his comprehensive
annual address drew attention to several
ventures launched to increase efficiency
and earnings, involving large sums of
capital, which are not yet contributing to
net profits or fully income-producing.
Examples were the shareholding in
United Telecasters Sydney Ltd
(£187,500), Email’s half-share of Com-
monwealth Ceramics Pty’s £600,000
development programme, and participa-

During 1963 a number of changes
were made to make better use of facili-
ties, by balancing production loads in
various seasons.
Marked improvement in trading was
only evident in the final quarter of 1963.
Directors say this is continuing in early
1964, with orders at a higher level than
for the same period last year. Intensive
competition still prevents a satisfactory
margin in some areas of Email’s busi-
ness.
The ss. shares, which were near 9s. a

Clarke Bros Still Losing
ITaving lost £61,397 in the last year to
June 30, Clarke Bros Holdings Ltd,
Sydney furniture-maker, has reported a
“substantial overall” loss for the six
months to December last.
Subsidiaries Durex Pty, of Brisbane,
and Thompson and Wright Ltd, of New
Britain, were, however, profitable. The
plastic business at Brookvale was closed
down and timber operations ceased at
Balmain to halt losses.
The company has not managed to sell
the Balmain property, which cost about
£330,000 in 1962 and which is draining
£40,000 a year away in interest.
The market took the news badly,
dropping the ss. shares from 2s. to
Is. sd.
Big Time in Fertilisers
Queenslander ACF and Shirleys Fer-
tilizers Ltd turned in a group net
profit of £280,294 in the year to Febru-
ary 29, up 46 p.c. on the previous year.
Earning rate strengthened from 18.8
p.c. to 25.2 p.c., but dividend remained
steady at 84 p.c.
The company is stepping into the big
time by a joint project with ICIANZ to
build a £34 million synthetic ammonia
plant at Pinkenba. It has also just
bought a half-interest in General Ferti-
lizers Ltd.
To finance this tremendous develop-
ment, it is now lifting paid capital to
£2.2 million with a three-for-four issue
at 25 p.c. premium.
The company will, therefore, need to
be conservative with its dividend.
New Look for Brad. Kendall
VTsw steel founder Bradford Kendall
Ltd is making a one-for-five issue
of 10s. ordinary shares to ordinary and
participating preference shareholders
registered on July 15.
This is the first capital move in 10
years. It was 1954 when Bradford made
a similar one-for-five issue, also at par,
and issued 100,000 10s. ordinary shares
to American Steel Foundries of Chicago,
for technical services.
The American company, now known
as Amsted Industries International, lent
Bradford £lOO,OOO in 1961 to assist
with the building of a plant to make
steel railway wheels by the “Griffin”
process. The loan is repayable half in
cash and half convertible into 100,000
shares in 1969.
The present issue is to provide fixed
and working capital in a further expan-
sion of facilities.
Sales during the current year to June
have been buoyant and profit satisfac-
tory, according to directors. (Last year
the company earned 15.8 p.c. on capital,
distributed 10 p.c.)
The shares price will probably be
stronger than the theoretical ex-rights
price of 15s. 3d., based on the last sale
before the issue was announced. As an
investment Bradford Kendall takes on a
new look.

Largesse from Burns, Philp
TTeralding the announcement of a splendid trading year to
March 31 is the nev/s that Burns, Phil p and Co. Ltd will
make a one-for-four bonus to shareholders on October 30.
October was the month for the three previous bonuses, in
1962, 1959 and 1958. These bonuses have lifted capital from
£4 million to the present £7.2 million, which will expand to
£9 million after the present hand-out.
Not that the last six years have been so greatly profitable
for the company: this is carving off some of the fat accumulated
over many years in island trading and shipping and insurance
interests, plus more recent rewards from investments especially
in G. J. Coles.
The 10 p.c. dividend can be taken as read, although the
company refrained from making any statement on dividend
policy in its initial announcement.
Trading results are usually revealed early in August.
Tom Piper’s Export Come-down
TPhe interim report from Tom Piper, the Melbourne-based
A manufacturer and distributor of processed foods, talks
surprisingly of only “satisfactory” export sales during the
December half-year. This is rather a come-down from the
tenor of last October’s annual report and shareholders’
meeting, where export discussion was somewhat prominent.
The annual report pointed out that the 1962-63 year had
seen the company’s products going to 53 countries. Full
advantage had been taken of the Government's export incen-
tives. At the meeting, the chairman, Mr A. W. Spooner, said
the newly entered Japanese market was readily accepting Tom
Piper products and, with its great potential, would eventually
become one of Australia’s biggest export outlets.
Only “satisfactory” exports in the half-year needs some
explanation seeing the outlook was so optimistic previously.
This situation makes the possibility of maintaining last year’s
23 p.c. earning rate look rather more remote on the 1963-64
capital, which has been increased by a one-for-four 'share issue
made late last year. However, the “marked” increase in
Australian sales should help things along in the right direction.
Undoubtedly a big chunk of this increase was due to the
sales of citrus juices, of which the company is now Australia’s
largest processor. The juice cannery underwent extensive
alterations last year in preparation for the 1963-64 summer.
But production this year has been lifted in all fields through
factory reorganisation and, apparently,- supply is not exceeding
demand. Most important for shareholders is the fact that
the 12| p.c. dividend is not in any danger on the higher
capital, since earnings in the half-year were “well maintained”.
Echo from a Dark Past
r’kLD shareholders of Metropolitan Portland Cement Co. Ltd
must gnash their teeth to see that company providing the
means for a bonus for Commonwealth Portland Cement Co.
Ltd before the latter floats off as a public company.
Under management of the UK Blue Circle group, Metro-
politan has been resuscitated. Last year it earned £245,000
profit, yet in the nine years to 1960 it had lost £2 million or
double its capital.
The 20s. shares were sold to Commonwealth Portland for
3s. cash, the value of its tax losses to that company.
Commonwealth Portland made a three-for-four bonus, lifting
paid capital from £900,000 to £1,575,000 by revaluing its
investment in Metropolitan to bring it in line with its present
work.
Standard Portland Cement Co. was recently bought from
Concrete Industries (Monier) Ltd for cash. When Common-
wealth does float, Monier has the right to apply for £500,000
of shares.
Commonwealth Portland is a subsidiary of Associated Port-
land Cement Manufacturers Ltd of the UK, which has another
subsidiary in Victoria, Victoria Portland Cement Co. Pty Ltd.
Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd is a partner there.
If all Australian operations are combined and floated off,
it will be a formidable group. But the just-announced bonus
takes off some of the cream before the public can get a taste.
Colortone’s Future Turns Black
Holdings, Frankston (Vic.) brick-maker, looks
like a stock for shareholders to write off as a bad invest-
ment. In the seven months to January 31, a loss of £3890
was made, according to an interim report. Moreover, the
directors are expecting a trading loss for the full year. In the
same report they say they are taking all possible measures to
improve turnover and reduce costs.
It seems that Mr G. Schaffer may have been correct last
November when he said that the company needed a change
of leadership. At that time, he was the largest shareholder
in the company and was attempting to gain at least 33 p.c.
of the ordinary ss. shares with an offer of 3s. He pointed out
that his own company (Calsil Pty Ltd, of Perth) sold bricks
at about £ll a thousand whereas Colortone was charging
£lB 15s. a thousand. Even after allowing £2 for higher costs,
this still left a difference of £5 15s.
At the company's annual meeting on October 30, Mr Schaf-
fer said the board lacked a member with practical experience
in the building industry. If his offer was accepted, a brick-
maker would be appointed and, after reorganisation, he
believed a dividend could be paid. Unfortunately for share-
holders, his offer did not receive a wide enough acceptance to
allow him to gain control.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Concrete Industries’ Price Slide
Anxiety over dividend , earning rate and takeover .
TlThether or not Concrete Industries
(Monier) Ltd made a “profit” on
the sale of Standard Portland Cement,
the announcement of the deal with
Commonwealth Portland Cement Co.
Ltd seems to have triggered off a down-
ward slide ir Cl’s share price.
The low point was reached in mid-
-1963 when the shares fell to 6s. 6d., but
within eight weeks they had risen to
Bs. 9d. and remained between Bs. 9d. and
7s. 9d. until the end of November. They
then rose smartly to 9s. 9d. and con-
tinued to sell at prices around 9s. 6d.
until the announcement of the interim
dividend, which pushed them up to
10s. Id. only to fall again to 9s. 4d. in
the following week.
Since then there has been a gradual
fall on apparently rising volume until
the Bs. level was reached at the end of
April. Assuming that the company will
pay an 8 p.c. dividend this year, the
shares are showing an immediate 5 p.c.
yield at this price. In relation to other
building materials stocks this seems an
attractive return, particularly when it
seems fairly certain that the company
will make every attempt to reach the
10 p.c. rate which was in fact paid for
18 months after the bonus issue in
March, 1961.
The market is presumably concerned
about the future of the dividend rate
and earning rate. It has been suggested
that Standard Portland’s earnings in
1962-63 were £240,000, which seems
reasonable since the figure was
£226,500 in the 1960-61 year. With a
view to getting some idea of the effect
on this year’s earnings, we must make
some assumptions.
Firstly we will assume that although
net profit before tax increased by nearly
50 p.c. during the first half of 1963-64
no increase will occur in the second
half. This would mean that earnings
for the original group would be about
£1,165,000. Secondly, we could
assume that the cement company’s earn-
ings would increase at a greater rate
than the increase in cement production,
which was 8.3 p.c. higher than it was
in the six months to December, 1962.
If we assume an arbitrary 10 p.c. in-
crease for the whole year of 1963-64
to about £265,000 then it could be
suggested that the remainder of the
group would perhaps earn about
£900,000 in 1963-64.
Obviously an exercise such as this can
only be performed effectively by the
company itself, since increases in profits
have undoubtedly varied in the different
activities. The important point seems
to be that the dividend commitment at
the 8 p.c. rate of £689,000 approxi-
mately has every prospect of being
covered, even after the loss of the earn-
ings from the cement company.
During the current year, Concrete
Industries has raised £1.5 million in
unsecured notes, so that with the £3.7
million to be received from the sale of
Standard Portland Cement the group
will have the use of £5.2 million at a
cost of about £330,000 in income given
up and interest to be paid after tax.
This puts the group in the position of
having to earn 6i p.c. net or better to
break even on these transactions. In
the 1960-61 year, earnings represented
nearly 8 p.c. on total capital employed,
so there is reason to believe that this
objective can be achieved.
Basically the activities of the group
have not changed dramatically since the
fifties. It is largely a “worker in
cement”, though it has expanded into a
number of allied fields including con-
tracting and civil engineering. It is
rather remarkable that five years ago
the issued capital had a market value of
about £6.6 million. Even today, after
the market fall in the per share price,
the market value is £13.8 million or
more than double. Net assets, however,
were under £2.2 million at the 1959
balance date, whereas at the 1963
balance date they were nearly £13.5
million. To use an accountant’s ter-
minology, the goodwill element in the
market price has nearly disappeared,
but one shouldn’t overlook the fact that
during this five-year period assets have
been revalued by £2.3 million.
Probably the present image of the
company is due to some extent to the
concern regarding the apparently ill-
considered takeovers from 1959 on-
wards. At June 30, 1959, paid
ordinary capital was approximately
£1,751,000. Additions since have been
as follows:
£’ooo
Bonus shares 1685
Rights issues 1402
Other ord. share issues 3776
Total 6863
If we ignore the bonus issue because
these issues are a paper adjustment and
do not involve the raising of further
funds, we find that, of the new equity
capital raised, 73 p.c. was issued to per-
sons other than existing shareholders.
While difficult economic conditions no
doubt helped considerably, it is a matter
of record that per share earnings reach-
ed a peak in the 1959-60 year and have
since declined quite dramatically. Fur-
thermore, the decline in earnings was
acorn pan icd by a reduction in the
dividend payout.
While takeovers have been few in the
last two years, it is notable that in the
18 months from February, 1963 (when
the share price collapsed following the
reduced interim dividend announce-
ment), until August, 1964, the company
will have issued nearly one million
shares in acquisitions as follows:
February 13, 1963, 650,000 at 11s. to
acquire Fowler Road Constructions Pty
Ltd from Clyde Industries.
July 2, 1963, 32,353 at par to acquire
convertible notes in Monier Besser Ltd.
August 15; 1964, the acquisition of a
51 p.c. holding in Super Centre Develop-
ment Corporation Ltd involved the com-
pletion of contracts for Concrete Indus-
tries to issue 306,000 shares at this
date, when the Hurstville Centre is
expected to be revenue-producing.
Now that Concrete Industries has ob-
tained substantial sums in cash, it may
well be that further expansion of the
equity capital will not be necessary in
the future. Prospects of a sustained
recovery in the market price do not
seem very bright until the trend in per
share earnings changes its present direc-
tion from downwards to upwards. On
past performance this seems difficult to
achieve when substantial quantities of
equity shares are being issued to acquire
other businesses.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
A Healthy, Reliable Stock
Gollin Holdings’ good prospects
Importer, exporter and manufacturer
* Gollin Holdings Ltd, of Melbourne,
has reported a moderate increase in
profits for the half-term to February 29.
The year to August 31 last was one
of recovery in earning rates to pre-
recession levels. Actual profit moved
far in excess of anything previously
turned in.
The net profit reached £505,779 after
tax of £278,760 and depreciation of
£128,314. Comparable result for 1961-
62 was £342,879 after £254,560 tax and
£130,409 depreciation.
Steel subsidiaries John Brunton (Steel)
Holdings Pty and Victorian Steel Fabri-
cations Pty had lost money in 1961-62,
but their trading was profitable in
1962-63.
The group covers a wide range of
activities. The main subsidiary, Gollin
and Co. Ltd, imports, exports, manages,
merchandises, distributes and has agency
representations throughout Australasia.
Products include building materials, in-
dustrial raw materials, graphic arts,
newsprint and paper, wines and spirits,
chemicals and plastics, textiles, tea and
coffee, groceries, minerals and metals,
sporting goods, carpets, packing
materials, etc.
Subsidiaries in Victoria include British
Engineering Pty, supplying capital equip-
ment and other goods for textiles, laun-
dries and dry cleaners; John Brunton
(Vic.) Pty, the iron and steel merchant;
Victorian Steel Fabrications Pty, sup-
plying the building and engineering in-
dustries; Webmac Steel Erectors Pty; V.
Ryba and Co. Pty, making printing
machinery parts; and Broadbent Amott
Pty, making laundry and dry cleaning
equipment.
A NSW subsidiary is Southern Cross
Stevedoring Co. Pty. NZ subsidiaries
represent textiles, distribute printing
machinery and general machinery, and
Ivan Seay Pty makes sporting goods.
In the UK, Galbraith Campbell and
Co. Ltd distributes tinplates and steel
sheets, W. J. Chapman and Son (Bris-
tol) Ltd distributes produce in the west
of England, and Gollin Paper and Pulp
(London) Ltd exports paper and pulp
from Scandinavia and Europe.
Share interests are held in a number
of companies for which the group, in
certain cases, has distributing rights.
The main ones are Australian Card
Clothing Pty, Biro Swan and Gollin Pty
(distributing Biro ballpoint pens), E.
and M. Latex (Aust.) Pty, manufactur-
ing rotary and sliced veneers, Mildara
Wines Ltd, Plattex Agencies, supplying
capital equipment to textile spinners, and
Viel and Company Pty, a Victorian
nylon throwster.
Investments in the 1962-63 balance
sheet showed a total £265,738, of which
£42,910 represented shares in listed com-
panies (with a then market value of
£80,600), and £219,239 was in shares
in unlisted companies.
Gollin’s business dates back to 1845.
The present holding company was form-
ed in 1957. A placement in August,
1958, preceded official stock exchange
listing. In 1960, the company made a
one-for-eight par issue and acquired
John Brunton.
In March, 1961, shareholders were
invited to subscribe to a one-for-four
par issue. Victorian Steel was also
taken over in that same financial year.
Since going public, dividend has been
increased from 7i p.c. to 8 p.c. and last
year 9 p.c. The new rate has been
continued this year by an interim 4i p.c.
A one-for-two bonus prior to public
listing skimmed off much of the cream.
No similar benefit could be expected for
a number of years yet, though par issues
every two or three years are a reasonable
expectation.
The present price of 9s. 10d., yielding
4.6 p.c., is below an earlier peak this
year of 10s. 6d. but higher than any
peak in the previous six years. The
company has showed its reliability and
prospects are healthy enough on such a
broad front. They are certainly worth
holding at that price.
GENERAL INDUSTRIES LTD
Battling out of the Rough
A fire at the Sovereign appliance
plant at Bankstown in February,
1964, was the latest misfortune to befall
General Industries Ltd.
Once considered a leader, the com-
pany fell into the rough some eight
years ago and dividend was cut from
10 to 4 p.c. Ordinary dividend was
totally omitted in 1962 and 1963 (year
to February). The company is now
uncertainly on a 2i p.c. rate.
Once devoted to the manufacture of
cast-iron porcelain enamelware, the
Metters company moved into household
refrigerators in 1954 by takeover
(Sovereign Appliances) just at the end
of the refrigerator boom. The next year
it joined with Admiral Corporation of
USA to make radio and television
receivers.
The American company sold out to
General Industries in 1961. In 1962-63,
that company decided the industry was
too competitive and ceased production,
although it still provides Admiral TV
service.
Another venture outside its traditional
Metters field was a joint effort with
James B. Clow and Sons of USA to
make cast-iron pressure pipe for water
and gas reticulation. High establish-
ment costs were incurred. In 1962 63,
General Industries provided £200,000
against this investment (£199,998 shares
and £496,398 cash advances) by transfer
from the provision for contingencies.
The net value of this investment in the
1964 balance sheet (February 29) was
£575,620, but after that date General
Industries sold this investment for a cash

figure considerably in excess of valuation.
In 1961-62, appliance production was
moved from Alexandria to Bankstown to
rationalise production and costs. Alexan-
dria is still the site for the Metters
mechanical bath plant, production of
commercial kitchen units, and ware-
housing and distribution of sanitaryware.
Nevertheless, fourteen acres of valu-
able property at Alexandria was released
for sale. Negotiations are still proceed-
ing. Its eventual sale will assist liquidity.
The buildings, plant and stock at the
combined Sovereign-Admiral plant which -
caught fire in February were insured for
damage by fire and loss of profits.
General Industries reported at the end of
April that range production was running
at record levels, refrigerator production
would begin in September, and other
products later. Despite the confident re-
port from the company, it is obvious that
considerable disruption has taken place,
which it can ill-afford.
The substantial loss incurred in the
recession year 1960-61 (£484,929) was
the result of changed operating condi-
tions, necessitating a write-down of
£301,116 in excess component and re-
placement parts. The loss has given tax
relief in the two succeeding years.
Net trading profit then moved up from
£124,483 to £167,497, but on the large
capital of £3.7 million this last is only
a 3.2 p.c. return. The company relies
on long-term creditors for £2.5 million,
an important consideration when asses-
sing General Industries shares as an
investment.
At February 29, the group had a
general reserve of £438,122 and profit
and loss balance of £641,488, plus a
provision for contingencies of £526,926,
to support £666,000 preference and
£3,726,503 ordinary capital.
The healthier condition of the home
building industry, to which the company
is so closely allied, must make prospects
brighter than for the last three years.
The company is confident that the pro-
gressive improvement of the last two
years is continuing.
Difficulties stemming from the fire,
and a fuller liability for tax this year,
should hold dividend down to nominal
levels this year. At 9s. 6d. the 20s.
shares now show a yield of 5.3 p.c. A
rating at less than half par shows the
market’s assessment of the risks involved.

A MEMBER COMPANY OF ANSETT TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES LIMITED
F. W. WILLIAMS HOLDINGS LTD
Diversification Ranges Widely
"Deginning with farm and station sup-
plies early in the century, F. W.
Williams Holdings Ltd has diversified so
that it now serves the primary, secon-
dary, building, transport and domestic
markets, and derives other income from
Hong Kong, South Africa and New
Zealand.
It is a difficult business to evaluate.
The greater part of income derives from
investments in associated companies
which are only 50 p.c. owned, and
therefore do not come into consolida-
tions.
Consolidated profits, at least since
1960, have been unimpressive in them-
selves. Because most income is in divi-
dends from the associates, the group has
not paid tax for the last six years.
F. W. Williams does, however, give
an adjusted net profit each year to in-
clude its shares of the surplus net earn-
ings of associates over dividends remit-
ted. These figures are quoted in the
accompanying table. An adjusted earn-
ing rate on average capital employed
has been calculated. This is more
meaningful than the official earning rate,
which would not justify the very high
esteem in which the stock is held on
the market.
As a proprietary company, F. W. Wil-
liams was set up in 1918 to sell fencing
and building materials, farm machinery
and veterinary lines through five NSW
country branches. In 1932, partnered
by American Reinforced Paper Co., it
established a sisalkraft industry (rein-
forced waterproof paper) in Australia.
In 1956 the holding company was
formed, and stock exchange listing
achieved. In June, 1960, the company
made a one-for-two bonus, and in
September, 1960, a one-for-four issue of
10s. shares at Bs. premium.
The year 1960 also saw a premium
placement, and the company’s entry to
the plastics business by takeover of
Casolin Pty and Glenncase Pty. These
specialised in the making of plastic
bottles.
In August, 1960, F. W. Williams
acquired a half interest in Bates (Aus-
tralasia) Pty, maker of multi-wall paper
sacks for cement, fertilisers, chemicals
and foods.
One of the world's largest paper com-
panies, St Regis Paper Co., acquired
American Sisalkraft Corporation, thus
becoming partners with F. W. Williams.
A new company was set up in 1961,
St Regis-Williams Pty, which obtained
their equal interests in Bates (Australa-
sia) Pty, Australian Sisalkraft Pty and
New Zealand Sisalkraft Ltd.
Sisalkraft has a factory at Homebush
(NSW), where a polyethylene lamination
production line has recently been in-
stalled. Bates has plants in Sydney,
Melbourne, Perth and Devonport. It is
taking particular interest in the develop-
ing use of multi-wall bags for domestic
garbage collection.
An entirely different venture was the
purchase in 1961 of a 50 p.c. interest
in Piper Aircraft Australia Ltd, distri-
buting in Australia and New Guinea.
This has been renamed Commerce
International Pty.
Two further moves were made into
the plastics industry in 1963. Beutron
Australia Ltd, which had been associ-
ated with Burns Philp until 1962, be-
came another 50 p.c. investment for
F. W. Williams. It makes plastic but-
tons at Willoughby (NSW), distributing
throughout Australia. Since 1954 it has
produced Beutron buttons in Hong Kong,
and has plants in South Africa and New
Zealand too.
Williams made a cash offer for Gene-
ral Plastics Ltd in June, 1963. This
company makes Leda buttons and other
merchandise and is being integrated
with the Beutron business.
Another purchase during 1963 was
Thermal Industries Pty, to further Wil-
liams’ interests in the plastics field inWA.
The 1963 accounts reveal a shortage
of working capital which will be ameli-
orated by the one-for-six issue at 12s. 6d.
premium, raising £335,025 to replace
short-term borrowings and finance the
Beutron purchase.
Group trading profit (excluding the
associated companies which were only
50 p.c. owned) rose from £86,602 to
£144,727 for the year to December 31,
1964. The dividend, which had been
15 p.c. in 1959 prior to the 1960 bonus,
has been 10 p.c. in each of the four
succeeding years.
The rural and plastics subsidiaries
accounted for the improvement in 1963,
so these interests should not be dis-
counted by investors in comparison with
the paper interests.
Application of 225. 6d. is payable on
June 12. The rights have been selling
around 9s. to give entry at 31s. 6d., the
same price as asked for the old shares.
Yield is a low 3.2 p.c., owing much to
the association with St Regis.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A Dull Market for Some, But Not for All
Reflections of a loyal holder of Cresco shares
CPhis is generally described by market
observers (whoever they may be)
as the dull time of the year.
But for me, it’s different. Yes, sir!
Hardly had I bought those Cresco when
out came the issue announcement.
Not that I’ve got the same complaint
as the shareholder who has waited for
thirty years and is now suddenly con-
fronted with his first issue at a 200 p.c.
premium. Considering that the shares
have only been above 60s. for a few
months of that long thirty-year wait, it’s
plain enough. And to aggravate matters,
we (the loyal shareholders) find that a
life assurance office is receiving shares
on exactly the same terms.
The market felt similarly aggrieved, as
it knocked 10s. off the share in one wild,
wild swoop. So, temporarily, down
comes the value of the portfolio by £lOO.
Taking into account this new develop-
ment, if 745. was too high for the share
then 645. was too low. To ensure that
I ended up with 50 rights, I bought an-
other 50 shares at 655. 6d. This averages
down the price of my holding to 695. 6d.
So much for my main South Aus-
tralian investment. The excursion into
the Adelaide stock market has been full
of action, but certainly not (as yet) of
profit. Perhaps I am in for parallel sur-
prises by venturing into the Melbourne
market.
Draffin Everhot made the target.
Although its business started in 1924,
it was not until the early ’fifties that the
company materially expanded and profits
began to grow. In its present form, one
subsidiary, Everhot Manufacturing Pty
Ltd, makes hot water systems, slow com-
bustion ranges and heaters at Fisher-
man’s Bend, and another, Delmatic
Manufacturing Co. Pty Ltd, turns out
cisterns at South Yarra. These products
are distributed through a third sub-
sidiary, Draffin Bros Pty Ltd. Draffin
Everhot’s fortunes are thus fairly closely
tied to the level of home building, par-
ticularly in Victoria.
Still only a small company, with a
capital of £187,500, it has built up a
very neat financial record. A l-for-4
bonus issue was made in December,
1959, when home building was moving
at top pace. Understandably, profits fell
slightly in the recession that followed.
But the company would appear to have
at least held its own in the industry. For
the year ended March 31, 1963, earning
rate was up to 23 p.c. again. Then, in
December last, directors reported that
profits had “improved considerably” in
the half-year to September over the
previous corresponding period.
With the financial year already ended,
it's just a matter of waiting around until
July for the result and a Is. dividend.
After some trying months, the port-
folio took its first real step forward by
rising £3OO in value. In front was ODE
with almost a full recovery in market
price. I was so pleased that I sold off
the 1000 shares I had bought the
previous week, to show a profit of £l5.
Malleys at 365. 6d. was not far behind.
There could be some temporary reaction
to the 3s. rise over the last two weeks.
So I'll trv and be smart and pick the top.
Eric White also deserves a special
mention. There have been a lot of cynics
who blandly forecast that the shares
were overpriced at 16s. They seemed
to find it impossible to comprehend that
a company which owns few fixed assets
can possibly prove to be a growth com-
pany. Conveniently they forget that
profits had shown a strong rise before
the listing, and at 16s. the shares sold
on a 10 p.c. earnings yield. In these
days of plant leasing and factoring of
debts, asset backing does not have much
direct meaning.
The other sale this week was the
2000 Mid Eastern at Is. 3d. A loss of
£52 was registered. The only consola-
tion I have about this transaction is that
I am now out of a depressing oil market.
(I’ll have to eat those words if there is
another oil gusher.)
The week's transactions were:
SOLD
2000 Mid Eastern, 1/3 £ll7
1000 ODE, 6/5 £3lO
BOUGHT
50 Cresco, 65/6 £167
300 Draff in Everhot, 25/6 £394
A little further in debt with a debit of
£lB9 and two weeks to go before I
balance off for the first six months.
The portfolio now is:
Packager Repairs Damage
Sydney packager J.
Fielding and Co. Ltd has apparent-
ly recovered some of the ground lost
last year.
Profit then slipped from a record
£363,316 in 1961-62 to £315,132 in
1962-63. Directors report now, three-
quarters of the way through the current
year, that sales and profit are higher
than in the previous corresponding
period.
Intense competition in the carton,
printing and box divisions of Jayfield
Pty in 1962-63 had produced a loss.
The 20s. shares at about 86s. 9d. to
yield 3.5 p.c. are cheaper than at any
time last year. (The range was 945. to
£6 Is. 6d.). They were considerably
cheaper also than this year's peak of
995. 6d., and should be worth picking
up.

Synthetics versus Wool Once More
Price-relationship theories rouse Simpson 9 s ire
HThe claim of Lawrence A. Simpson
(The Bulletin, May 9) that the
“price relationship” between synthetics
and wool is largely mythical might
appear, on the surface, to be an out-
rageous statement.
Nearly every Wool Board and Inter-
national Wool Secretariat public rela-
tions handout includes the phrase that
such and such is being done “to keep
wool to the forefront in the never-
ending battle with man-made fibres”.
The Minister for Primary Industry,
Mr Adermann, prefaced his introduction
to the seven wool bills in Parliament
a few weeks ago with a reference to the
“threat of synthetics”.
At any- function even remotely related
to primary industry, personages up to
and including Governors-General have
used the same theory in making their
speeches, whether it be the opening of
a national producers’ conference or a
local agricultural show.
Whether the threat is real, or whether
most of us have become conditioned to
believe it is real, is another matter.
Simpson has frequently challenged any
member of the Wool Board or the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference to
show when a price fall in synthetics has
been followed by a price fall in wool.
So far no one has provided a satis-
factory answer to his challenge.
He has maintained his one-man cru-
sade for years now. In the same period
the Wool Board, and its predecessor the
Wool Bureau, has had quite a noticeable
turnover of staff ... in PR particularly.
The second answer, that there is a time
lag, is one that can be exploited but
logically has no basis either.
Anyone might concede that, in the
case of the finished article, there might
be a time lag. But in the case of the
raw product it would be little short of
incredible if a wool-buyer, armed with
the knowledge of an impending price
drop in synthetics, did not adjust his
bidding for wool accordingly.
That is, if there really is a price rela-
tionship.
It comes down to this. If Simpson is
right, then much of the Wool Board’s
activities, and of the IWS also, are of
the nature of a gigantic hoax and a
pretty expensive one at that.
Price drops there have been in wool.
Simpson, however, suggests that these
have been less related to the movement
in synthetics prices and more related
to shortcomings in the free auction
system with its attending manifestations
such as forward selling, private selling
and buyers’ “pies”.
He says that since 1951, when synthe-
tics had 0.9 p.c. of the apparel fibre
market of the world, their share has
risen to 6.8 p.c.
Therefore they have gained 5.9 p.c.
In this period wool has lost 0.3 p.c. of
the market with sales ahead of pro-
duction.
Synthetics have gained 2158 million
pounds fibre weight. Wool has gained
1000 million pounds clean weight. Total
apparel fibres have increased 10,300
million pounds.
But cotton has lost 6.8 p.c. of the
total market, which is very close to the
5.9 p.c. gained by synthetics.
Again, because total apparel fibre
consumption is up, cotton has gained
some 3800 million pounds weight.
When it is noted, says Simpson, that
the percentage gain by synthetics is very
close to the percentage loss of cotton—
the cheapest of the natural fibres —would
it not be a natural conclusion that syn-
thetics must get closer to cotton in price
to further increase their sales?
Synthetics, he says, are a necessity
because they fill the gap between pro-
duction capacity of the natural fibres
and the increasing apparel needs of the
world.
If wool is to maintain its present
share of the apparel fibre market of the
world, about 100 million pounds clean
weight must be produced each year. But
woolgrowers will have no incentive to
increase their production until they have
some sensible marketing scheme.
What is a sensible marketing scheme?
Simpson suggests a floor price scheme
with a floor of, possibly, 60d.
He describes it as not radical but con-
servative.
It would mean that every grower


‘FLOATING ACTION’ garage door fittings
From Hardware stores everywhere r.w/z
DESERVES GENUINE
would get one genuine bid on his wool
at the floor price (it varies for particular
types). He could get more but never
less than the floor price.
One of the most important and far-
reaching parts of his scheme is that
growers would accept responsibility for
financing the “buying in” operations on
a £-for-£ basis with the Federal Govern-
ment and would thereby retain control
of their industry.
Initially, growers might put in 1 p.c.
of the first five years’ wool proceeds,
with the Government guaranteeing an
overdraft of, say, £lOO million in order
to give the scheme potential financial
strength if it is needed. In all proba-
bility, it would not be needed.
It might conceivably be needed, for
example, if Russia depressed the entire
world’s wool clip by a huge dumping of
wool ... if she had the wool to dump!
This is where Simpson’s scheme
differs from what might be termed a
“radical” scheme, which would have the
Government, and the taxpayers gener-
ally, accepting the entire financial
responsibility.
Some cynics amongst woolgrowers,
and there are plenty, say that Simpson’s
scheme is likely to work and therefore
will be opposed all along the line by
those interests which want no change at
all from the present free auction scheme.
On the other hand, some “radical”
scheme might get the token support of
these interests because they w'ould know
that it would never get the approval of
the country at large.
During 1962, Simpson conducted his
own poll amongst meetings he addressed
at Hamilton, Horsham, Benalla, Mary-
borough and Beaufort in Victoria and
Corowa, Wagga, Deniliquin and Wal-
gett in NSW.
These are big wool centres. They
are exactly the kind of centre that any-
one conducting a Gallup Poll on w'ool-
grow-ers’ interests w'ould select as repre-
sentative centres.
In secret ballots Simpson got 973
votes in favor of a floor price scheme
and 265 against.
He is convinced that a nationwide
ballot w'ould give much the same per-
centage in favor of a floor price.
Any impartial observer must concede
that a ballot should be possible on such
an important issue and that a ballot
might normally be expected to be the
best method of electing such an all-
powerful body as the Australian Wool
Industry Conference up to and including
its chairman.
The cost would be a mere fraction
of what the Wool Board spends on pro-
motion and would probably be less than
many of the Wool Board’s internal
operating costs.
Simpson says that if the AWIC were
elected by ballot then it would be a
foregone conclusion that the majority of
its members would favor a floor price
scheme and that this is the real reason,
and not the cost of staging a ballot,
which has prevented free election of
AWIC members.
The danger of Simpson’s line of argu-
ment is that it tends to create an impres-
sion that promotion of wool is a waste
of time.
On this he is explicit. There should
be promotion, but it should go hand in
glove with sensible marketing of wool.
What harm has been done by the
lack of marketing?
Simpson gives a good example by
quoting the fact that in 1958 the price
of clean average 64’s fell from a “high”
of 150 d. to a “low” of 85d.
The average price for the Australian
wool clip fell from 62.45 d. to 48.57 d.
In spite of the fact that in each year
since 1958 the world used more wool
than was produced, it has taken the
market four years to recover.
“With wool now selling at its highest
prices for six years and all synthetic
fibres selling at their lowest for the
same period, any talk of a price rela-
tionship is just a myth concocted by
persons with promotion fever,” Simpson
declares.
Until someone in the Wool Board or
the IWS takes up Lawrence Simpson’s
challenge to show when a price fall in
synthetics has been followed by a price
fall in wool he will continue to impress
more and more woolgrowers.
“Concrete Farms” on the Way
Farmer gets 16 per cent on his investment
From MICHAEL THRELFALL in Sydney
A movement towards mass production
and automation in animal rearing
has recently been started in Australia.
This is not surprising, for the movement
towards more scientific farming has
already got off to a good start in some
overseas countries.
The so-called concrete, or fieldless,
farm has existed successfully for some
time in the United States. It is also
used fairly extensively in Britain. But
in Australia, this automated factory-
farming type of operation has mainly
been confined to poultry. Because
poultry can stay reasonably healthy
under extremely crowded conditions,
they lend themselves ideally to factory
farming.
In recent years, however, some farms
have extended this factory-type farming
concept to sheep and cattle. After
some early failures, some factory-type
farms in Australia are now proving very
successful.
The main technique used overseas,
and copied here, is “lot-feeding”. With
lot-feeding, animals are not allowed to
graze in the normal way, but spend
most, if not all, their lives being hand
fed in comparatively small yards. (These
yards are often paved with bitumen or
concrete, thus the term “concrete
farm”.)
In this type of farming full utilisa-
tion is made of all fodder grown on
the farm. It is harvested and stored at
the height of its nutritiousness. Stock
get a constant diet, not affected by sea-
sonal changes in pasture growth.
Furthermore, stock are not able to eat
out pastures before they reach their
maximium nutritious value.
There are two main reasons for the
success of lot-feeding, both here and
overseas. In the first place, lot-feeding
permits control over what the beasts eat
and it gives the farmer a better chance
of using his fodder in the most produc-
tive way.
The second factor that makes lot-
feeding so successful is the big saving
in labor costs. An example of this is
Mr Leslie H. Ford's property at Dubbo
(NSW), where with lot feeding one man
can look after up to 6000 sheep.
Mr Ford is one of the pioneers of
lot-feeding in Australia. He brought
back from the US most of his ideas and
some of his machinery. He deals
mainly with sheep, which he has found
lend themselves to this type of opera-
tion better than cattle.
Mr Ford says it is very hard to esti-
mate the average number of stock on
his property at any given time, as sheep
are constantly being bought and sold.
The figure is probably between four

ind five thousand a phenomenally
i nigh stocking rate of over ten sheep to
::he acre on the 430-acre property.
All fodder used is grown on the pro-
perty, which has 70 acres under irriga-
; tion. Cost of feeding a sheep on hay
is about one penny a day, or 30s. a
year, and in return he gets about £4
worth of wool a year from each sheep.
There is storage space on the farm for
1500 tons of hay and 14,000 bushels of
grain. Even with its incredibly heavy
stocking rate, the farm was recently
able to sell some surplus grain.
From an economic point of view, Mr
Ford’s experiment with lot-feeding has
aroved itself. He estimates that he is
getting a return of about 16 p.c. on his
investment. This is about four times
jihe return the average grazier gets,
according to figures issued by the Gra-
ziers’ Association of NSW.
Mr Ford’s experiment with lot-
feeding is not the only operation of this
type in Australia. A slightly different
lot-feeding operation, for example, is
used near Sydney at the Camden Park
Estate where 840 lot-fed cows are milk-
ed twice a day.
Again, a variation of the principle of
full utilisation of pastures is found in
the Wollogorang grazing system. The
Wollogorang Pastoral Company, at
Breadalbane, near Goulburn (NSW),
grazes sheep at up to 120 to the acre for
a period of about one week. The
sheep are rotated through from eight
to 12 paddocks. By the time they re-
turn to the original paddock, the pas-
ture has recovered and is ready for
grazing again.
Undoubtedly, these new techniques,
probably in adapted forms, will come
into wider use in Australia as farmers
realise the great potential they have to
increase profits.
Meat and the American Market
Killing standards favor the big companies
Ane of the more unfortunate aspects
of the negotiations with the United
States over meat imports would appear
to be that, from now on, the big Austra-
lian meat companies will have the trade
sewn up.
Unless the US Government upsets the
agreement to a voluntary 6 p.c. cut-
back we may continue to have access to
the market.
We may send, in actual fact, con-
siderably less than we are entitled to
this year, which should please the cattle-
men of the US who want a 25 p.c. cut-
back or more.
But this is one of those cases in which
We ” is a rather misleading term.
Meat is exported by individual ex-
porters to individual American import-
's, who sell it in turn to American
retailers.
Amongst the biggest of these indi-
V| dual exporters are the big companies
which maintain their own cattle stations,
their own killing centres, and which, in
some cases, have American affiliations.
These companies have spent a lot of
money in bringing their killing centres
I 1? to the standards required for the
h trade. These requirements are
exac t and stringent.
, For example, even if a killing centre
ls sending only boneless beef to the US
'[ could be delicensed (for the US trade)
1 *t killed sheep “on the floor”.
American regulations state that sheep
must be killed “on the chain”, which
means the animals are suspended from
an overhead gantry.
The big companies have seen to it
that their works conform with the US
regulations and, as a side benefit, the
Australian public will get meat killed in
accordance with the US regulations,
which is probably a good thing.
Yet the average farmer may now lose
the benefit of the US trade because much
of his stock is bought, say, in one or
two pen lots by smaller exporters who
have the meat killed at small centres.
Last week the Shepparton, Victoria,
Council abattoirs lost its licence as a
killing centre for meat for the US.
A Brisbane report says that at least
four Queensland meatworks and one
boning room have lost licences.
Rumor has it that at least eight near-
Melbourne killing centres will lose
licences also.
Just as well, perhaps, that there is the
opportunity to “diversify” to such mar-
kets as Greece, Italy, and Japan.
Is everything all fair and square and
above board in the losing of the licences?
The manager of an exporting firm in
Shepparton does not think so.
He has alleged that the Department
of Primary Industry, in taking away the
licences, has acted directly as a result
of US agitation and is making sure that
only a certain quantity of meat is avail-
able for the US.
His company, he said, had purchased
7000 cattle at Shepparton saleyards,
nearly all from mixed farms, to the value
of some £200,000 since January.
For the district the delicensing of the
Council abattoirs was a disaster.
Similar situations were likely to deve-
lop all over the country, leaving the US
market to the big concerns and, no
doubt, making American cattle interests
very happy.
The charge, in some quarters, is that
the Department of Primary Industry has
been a lot harsher than was really
necessary.
To be fair, it may be quite possible
that the US has instructed that regula-
tions must be much more strictly en-
forced, in which case Primary Industry,
which has the task of carrying out in-
spections, possesses no option but to
crack down.
Either way, it is an interesting aspect
of the export situation. It is not insig-
nificant, perhaps, that the crack-down
has coincided with the talks in Washing-
ton at which Australia’s representatives
put up a rather good case.
