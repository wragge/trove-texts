Staircase of
“Pepperers and Spicers”
Grocers’ Hall.
gECOND of the twelve great
livery companies of the City,
the Grocers’ Company had its
origin in the early fourteenth cen-
tury, and has always played an
important part in the history of
London. The Company’s first hall
was built about 1427 on a site near
the Bank in Old Jewry, but the
existing building in the Poultry was
erected between 1789 and 1802.
Notable for its services to the
people, the Grocers’ Company built
a new wing to the London Hospital
in 1876 and has contributed gener-
ously to technological research.
The Company’s Hall, as may be
judged from its Grand Staircase, is
a building worthy of the dignified
traditions of the Grocers’ Company
anciently known as Pepperers and
Spicers.

SYBYLLA'S CAREER.
The liveliest chapters of Miles Frank-
lin’s My Career Goes Bung (Georgian
House) are those in which Sybylla Mel-
vyn, her heroine, describes the reactions
of her friends, relatives and acquaintances
in a country district to the shocking dis-
closure that she has written a book.
Every writer, and artist, has suffered
something of the same experiences.
First, there is the ecstasy of the young
writer when the first copies of her first
book arrive from the publishers: “I had
never had a book affect me like this one.
It was as if the pages were on fire and the
printing made of quicksilver.” There is
no joy like it. But then —exaggerated
no doubt in Sybylla’s case, as everything
else is, yet essentially true enough—came
the comments of the family;
Ma came forward. She and Pa and Eusty
each seized a book. “I don’t understand
this,” said Ma dubiously. “Some confi-
dence-trick man must have got hold of you.
How did this book get to the printer?”
Eusty speedily arrived at his opinion.
He had no impediment to arriving at his
opinion on any subject. Old Harris said
that Eusty was a perfect - example of the
cocksure Australian youth, possessed of the
irreverence which resulted from lack of
culture.
“I reckon this is a slashing lark,” he
grinned. “And, crickey, if it doesn’t get
people’s nark up, I’m a goanna with two
tails.” Eusty further expressed himself
as full up of it, as it was only a blooming
girl’s book, and went about his jobs.
It is a wonderful and a woeful thing
to have written a book. People do “get
their nark up.” Eusty, when a few days
have gone by, elatedly reports that the
whole district has gone “snakeheaded”
about Sybylla’s book, and Pa discovers a
neighbor furtively reading it “to see if it
was as wicked as people were saying.”
Having read it, the student of wickedness
is perfectly willing to put the book on the
fire. “At any rate, my girl,” Pa com-
ments, “You’ve made people read a book
for the first time in their lives.” Sybylla
continues;
Every house in the district had the book,
though hitherto .the only reading had been
“Penny Post” and the Bible or a circular
from TattersalTs. It was the sensation of
the age and at least relieved dullness.
People in other Possum Gullies were equally
excited and not so annoyed. The mailbag
grew fuller and fuller with the weeks.
Grandma becomes a reader. “She
wrote that she had hoped her eyelids
would be closed in death before such a
disgrace had been brought upon her.”
The book, of course, being an accurate
picture of life, is generally held to be “a
bad advertisement for Australia”; as no
doubt when Homer was Sybylla’s age, the
behavior of Ulysses was considered a bad
advertisement for Greece. And Sybylla
sums up:
Now I could see why people have written
those self-praising, whitewashing autobio-
graphies... .People can’t endure their
reality in print.
It is always pleasing to see an author
hitting back; for what with policemen,
censors, wowsers and relatives —to say
nothing of the difficulty of writing the
book for everybody to kick at —he is a
lucky author who does not lead a dog’s
life. And Sybylla hits back very prettily.
How much this is an imaginary
authoress describing the reception of an
imaginary book and how much Miles
Franklin discussing the welcome accorded
My Brilliant Career no one can say. My
Career Goes Bung is one of those bolts
from the blue Miles Franklin likes to
launch on the literary’ world from time
to time: a successor and a sort of
epilogue to My Brilliant Career, her first
book, published in 1901. Apparently
the present volume was written not long
after the other; one copy of the MSS.
lay for years in a trunk in Chicago, and
was burnt with other valuable papers by
an incendiary caretaker; another copy,
unknown to the author, “survived in an
old trunk valiantly preserved by my
mother.” On the question of its auto-
biographical content, Miles Franklin
says:—
While intentionally quite as little, unin-
tentionally it was equally as autobiographi-
cal as my first printed romance; no more,
no less.
Which really doesn’t help very much.
Presumably a reader would be justified
in assuming that when, tasting triumph
in Sydney after the peculiar reception at
Possum Gully, Sybylla called on A. G.
Stephens, Miles Franklin was somewhere
in the vicinity:
I decided to go secretly to The Bulletin
office. The Bulletin was a mine of fascin-
ation, but not considered nice for young
girls or clergymen. 1 had a friend in the
office, Mr. A. G. Stephens. I was much
more eager to know him than dozens of
silly old Sir James Hobnobs and stuffy
professors and ponderous Parliamentarians,
but Mr. Stephens was regarded as a devil
with horns....
Nothing could now have stopped me
from going to Mr. Stephens, and I climbed
to his office and spontaneously burst into
affection for him in a fraternal and intellec-
tual way. How generous he was! He took
me to tea, he gave me books, wonderful
new books for my own that I had not
dreamed of possessing. He talked in a
whimsical way with twinkles in his eyes,
adding to my literary education in every
paragraph....
If some fairy had offered me a gift I
should have chosen to be able to draw, so I
asked breathlessly for Norman Lindsay. He
was young like myself, his drawings were
more shocking than my book, and he was
equally talked about. Mr. Stephens shook
his head. Norman would not be interested in
me: I was not his type physically or men-
tally. He would be contemptuous of me as
a bread-and-butter miss. No coaxing would
make him disgorge Norman, but he gave
me a book illustrated by him.
And Sybylla, no doubt, is voicing an
opinion much in accord with Miles
Franklin’s when, discussing the Austra-
lian balladists with an Englishman who
thought them “crude,” she declares: “In
another generation or two these Austra-
lian ballads would be lauded as being as
typically Colonial as Burns’s were Scot-
tish. I held that our poets were folk-
loreists, and worthy of all the affection
we gave them. I ventured to suggest that
perhaps the English mind, to its loss,
did not extract the essence of Austra-
lianism.”
My Career Goes Bung might have been
a more valuable book had there been
more of this sort of thing ; if it had been
Miles Franklin’s autobiography, that is,
instead of partly hers but chiefly
Sybylla’s. For, lacking something of the
underlying fierceness that makes My
Brilliant Career a dramatic novel as well
as a mirror of its period, the present book
depends chiefly on the picture of literary
and social life in Sydney.
The Possum Gully chapters, though
the most amusing and most salutary, are
only a preparation for. the exploration of
Sydney. Sybylla’s comments on Society
are lightly entertaining, but sketchy and
acid, not to be compared with the pic-
tures of the squattocracy in My Bril-
liant Career. The assorted flirtations, in
which Sybylla continues to “wipe her
boots” on the defenceless male of the
species in a way at once maddening and
captivating, at the best repeat the scenes
of the earlier book and as a whole are
weaker. When the Sybylla of My Bril-
liant Career strikes her lover across the
face and eyes with a riding whip be-
cause, having just become engaged to
her, he dares to proffer a kiss, she is, of
course, melodramatic ; Sybylla the auto-
biographer is allowing Sybylla the hero-
ine to enact a most improbable fantasy:
but a reality underlies the melodrama ;
Sybylla in that moment touches greatness,
a character on the heroic scale, Miltonic,
affirming the splendor of passion by the
violence of her rejection of it; and in
My Career Goes Bung she never quite
reaches again that peak of intensity.
The charm of My Brilliant Career is
its violence: the passionate contrariness
that makes Sybylla declare in her intro-
duction “Do not fear encountering such
trash as descriptions of beautiful sunsets”
and then pack her book, from end to end,
with the most lovely descriptions of land-
scapes, including sunsets; the tempestu-
ous ecstasies and despairs of adolescence
that have the heroine raging in one
chapter, “Why was I ugly and nasty and
miserable and useless?” and in the next
excitedly recording compliments to her
beauty and brilliance; the exquisite
naivete of youth that announces itself, at
sixteen, to be afflicted for life with a
“pitiless cynicism.” And this vehemence
—this dainty and adorable ferocity—is
watered down a little in My Career Goes
Bung ; tamer; Sybylla is a little more
mature.
A remarkable sea-change, too, in the
Character of Pa, who has become wise
and sympathetic, moderates the impact
of My Career Goes Bung; and, a dawn-
ing respect for old Harris, the drunken
schoolmaster. No longer is it quite the
same charming portrait of a girl who
thinks —as everyone does in adolescence
—that the whole world is in league
against her.
And so, while it is attractive enough
in its very simple way as a novel —the
story of a country girl who wrote a
book, experienced fame and flirtation in
Sydney, and decided to leave for Lon-
don — My Career Goes Bung, insofar as
it adds anything to My Brilliant Career,
rests on its contacts with the literary
world of Sydney. It is not so much a
novel in the tradition of the Brontes as a
journal in the category of Fanny Bur-
ney’s. And as such it is altogether too
sketchy. It appears that Sybylla met
Lawson, Paterson, E. J. Brady, Roderic
Quinn and Will Ogilvie, yet there is no
more about these giants than a list of
their names. Sybylla spends most of her
time attacking nobodies: which leads
one very much to hope that Miles Frank-
lin has yet another thunderbolt to de-
liver —a genuine autobiography record-
ing her meetings with the somebodies.
My Career Goes Bung is “inveterately
dedicated to all Australian writers who
were as young, who are as young, and
who each decade for ever will be forth-
coming as young as I was when first I
foolhardily tried to write”; and it might
well inspire confidence in any young
writer who reads it; for, slight though
it is, it has a feeling of durability, there
are warmth and life in it. A manuscript
doesn’t preserve itself for more than 30
years in an old trunk without good
reason. My Brilliant Career —“the first
Australian girl untinctured with alien
notions who got herself into our fiction
complete with A. G. Stephens
said of it —still reads enchantingly today,
and is probably destined to survive as a
minor Australian classic, along with On
Our Selection and Norman Lindsay’s A
Curate in Bohemia; and My Career Goes
Bung could very well travel along with
it as a not unworthy appendage. It will
not “go bung” in a hurry. None of these
books is a War and Peace ; none a Great
Expectations or a Bleak House; none to
be ranked with the great achievements in
construction and dramatisation. But the
lyric endures as well as the epic and the
drama ; art is sometimes a very simple
matter after all: merely to set down natu-
rally and with spirit the life One has lived
or observed.
A Sentimental Journey.
It is stated in The Overlanders (Shak-
speare Head), a novel by Dora Birtles,
that “this book was inspired by the Ealing
Studios film of the same name, which was
written and directed by Harry Watt.”
Scenes from the film are reproduced on
the dust-wrapper and, judging from the
text, it would appear that the author has
faithfully transcribed the story from a
preview.
Regarded as advance publicity for the
film —and it is difficult to look at it in
any other way—the book promises well
on the whole. If it does not add very
much to what is already known, it at
least strengthens the impression that the
film will be an exceptionally fine “docu-
mentary” on the droving of cattle across
the continent when it seemed as if Aus-
tralia would be invaded.
It is a trifle ominous that the scenes of
romance or drama associated with the
droving of the cattle should be so hack-
neyed, sentimental and melodramatic.
The best films are usually made from a
novel or stage-play of genuine literary
merit. Dora Birtles, writing a book based
on the film, has, of course, reversed this
procedure; and that is yet another, illus-
tration of the fact that, generally speak-
ing, films made in Australia ignore literary
values. The “Rats of Tobruk” film, for
instance, should obviously have been
based on Lawson Glassop’s novel—and
what publicity it would have had!
Since “The Overlanders” is primarily
a “documentary” the criticism should
perhaps not be applied too strictly here;
and, indeed, artificial situations being
always more acceptable in plays or films
than they are in a novel, the bits of com-
paratively cheap comedy and romance
may be more than adequate for their pur-
pose. But the principle remains true;
that until the film industry in Australia
is founded in a proper respect for litera-
ture (which means, really, the full and
truthful portrayal of character) it will be
unsound at the core.
What makes it difficult to assess Dora
Birtles’s novel as a work of prose fiction,
detached from the film, is that all its
faults are typically those of the talkies,
In a realistic novel, for instance, it is ex-
tremely improbable that the heroine, her
horse having been caught in a trip-wire
placed across the track by some soldiers,
would be mistaken for a Jap parachutist
and have her wrists and ankles tied with
rawhide ; but that sort of thing is always
happening in the films.
History, so the present commentator is
informed, does not record that settlers on
the far edge of the Kimberleys, retreating
before the threat of invasion, found it
advisable to burn their houses to the
ground—a proceeding out of which’ Dora
Birtles extracts much pathos. Nor,
though a few bombs did fall here and
there, does it seem likely that a realistic
novel would insist that a small girl, bear-
ing a startling resemblance to Shirley
Temple, should be wounded in the hand
by “a new sort of insect” —a pebble sent
flying by blast.
And then, though there are crocodiles,
it does not seem wholly probable that
they, like the bomb, should pick on Shir-
ley Temple so that at the very last
moment she can be saved from a horrible
death. And then, though drovers do
fight, and perhaps could be pacified by a
determined Ma Parsons, it is film tech-
nique rather than fictional probability
that arms Ma with a frying-pan.
The writer of a realistic novel would
hardly care to spoil an exciting descrip-
tion of a brumby-hunt with a conclud-
ing scene in which Shirley Temple slides
from a rock, lands with a thump on a
drover and knocks the wind out of him.
Or, supposing such an incident were pos-
sible, it would at least be understood
that the child is acting from malice afore-
thought, The film industry uses such
tricks to end a scene with a laugh and to
arouse mother-love in the audience; and
Dora Birtles does likewise.
Again, when five men have had a few
beers in a realistic novel, it may reason-
ably be expected that they will not all
fall down together in a heap because
one of them trips; but in Dora Birtles’ 5
tale they do all fall in a heap. And then
of course Ma appears and commands,
“Come on, you lot. We’re moving the
cattle in a couple of hours.”
And, lastly, it is only on very rare
occasions in real life that one’s beloved
cowgirl, having pressed one’s hand and
murmured “But no drove will ever be like
this one —for me,” chooses precisely that
interesting moment to “gallop off.” In-
cidentally, Dora Birtles seems to have
forgotten in this scene —unless one is to
take the steed for granted when she
“walks behind the cattle” —that the
heroine is not on horseback.
A story containing these improbabilities
cannot be convincing. They cannot oe
disregarded, for they undermine, as «
were, the whole. The drovers, though not
of the rich individuality of Furphy’s bul-
lockies, are well enough portrayed as
generalised types; the landscapes are
attractive enough, the direct description
of the droving Is interesting; but on
can never be certain of what is truth an°
what is melodrama.
THE DEAD CURRAWONG.
Good Friday’s hunt was up; she had heard its
noise
Hour by hour nearer, and at last had run,
Clutching her soul’s once-rich, imperilled rags,
To hide in the mindless peace of earth and sun.
Along the shore fear was blown out and
drowned
In wind’s salt singing, gulls’ cries and loud sea;
Spirit and step sprang, till the track turned in
Across the dark and hollow flat, to be
A furtive thread through the blind sheoaks.
There,
Shouting of wind and waves was blanketed
Suddenly in warm stillness; her skin pricked;
Her feet dragged, and her blood’s sick thud-
ding said, ,
Don’t look behind: they have circled and cut
you off,
They are closing in, their eyes burn from the
shade —
No, not ahead! Don’t look ! And the trees
parted,
The light struck down; she knew herself un-
made.
Before her slept, all yellow in the sun,
A paddock of tall corn; full cobs held high
(Save where knife’s wake of stubble shimmered),
leaves
N.s.w.
Unfurled from them, flags summer-bleached and
dry,
Crackled as if with enemies in ambush;
But not because of this her stabbed heart cried,
But to see there, on the weathered fence-post
hung
To warn his fellows, a thief crucified.
Black wings outstretched against the drowsy
gold,
Not any more shining, dull in death’s rust.
Not any more through the high timber flying,
That strong hooked beak not to drink one blue
gust
Of windy morning sky again, nor send
His plangent call running amongst the rocks;
Poor guilty, guiltless thief, by the bloodstained
hand
Of man nailed there, whose crazy fear thus
mocks
And crucifies alike sinner and Sinless
Lest they spoil yellow hoard and body’s bread —
Black shape against the autumn afternoon,
The harvest ripe in the shadow of the dead.
And by this sign she knew that she was trapped,
That not once on her year-long flight had she
Been out of sight: now was her twisting course
Brought to the place she had fled, even Calvary.

Recipe for shoemakers’ burnishing ink —black
and brown 7
Black: Carnauba wax, five parts;-Japanese
wax, five parts; paraffin wax, five parts; oil of
turpentine, 50 parts.; lampblack, one part; wine-
black, two parts. Melt the wax and paraffin,
add the turpentine, then the two blacks. When
the color is evenly mixed, pour while still warm
into suitable tins. Brown: Omit the two blacks,
and use similar quantities of Bismarck or Van-
dyke brown. Beeswax may be used, but it is
not so hard and durable as the blend recom-
mended.
How to get rid of silverfish 7
Spring-clean the rooms or cupboards, etc.,
and destroy all unwanted papers, as these insects
thrive on the glazed paper used in catalogues
and magazines. To destroy them there is no-
thing better than insect spray applied to cracks
and crevices with a pump; failing this, use
kerosene or turpentine freely, and allow ’it to
trickle down behind boards and linings.
What is frankincense, and how is it obtained?
It is a gum-resin obtained from trees of the
genus Doswellia, of the order Buseracex. It
is gathered by means of a deep incision made
in the trunk, from which it exudes, hardening
by exposure to the air. It has a bitter taste,
and smells Ijke balsam when heated. It burns
with a bright flare and fragrant odor, and is
used in incense, fumigating powders and in the
composition of stimulating plasters.

(1) The figures (excluding unopposed returns,
University seats —which are decided on a P.R.
basis —and Central Hull, which had to postpone
its voting as the Labor candidate died in the
campaign) were Conservative 8,660,560, Ulster
Unionist 392,454, National 142,906, Liberal

(2) With the exception of the few University
seats which have a system of preferences, the
election is on the “first-past-the-post” principle.
(1) Has irrigation in the Murrumbidgee area

(1) Officers of the Meteorological Bureau are
of the opinion that the rainfall is not affected,
but various people have claimed that the rain-
fall has increased. Mrs. Marshall, of Adelaide
University, has investigated the matter, and
statistics may be obtainable from her. 0 Zinc
in very small quantities is not injurious to
humans, and very little zinc would be dissolved
from the kettle under normal conditions.

Down the crowded esplanade
By the frothy sea.
In my blazer I’m a “card,”
Females fair at every yard
Gaze admiringly.
I just arrived home,
And none to soon;
Down poured the rain
On a night in June.
I lit a fire for
To warm the room—
No fire in the grate
In winter is gloom.
As tooting motors
In the street sped by
And peltered the rain
From a inky black sky,
'Twas grand to be home;
I’d been out since noon.
Wild winter in earnest
Was that night in June.
In winter the wind makes a ghastly carouse,
With all the loose timber in my boarding-house,
And in summer my shirts are dishevelled and torn
When they come from the laundry—and I am forlorn
When I think of the meals that would rightly be
mine
In a home of my own when I come home to dine:
Potatoes and pumpkins and lashings of stew—
I’ve made up my mind that the best thing to do
Is to marry a wife who can cook, wash and sew,
And then I’ll live cheaply on half of the dough.

SHE GOT IT FROM HER MOTHER
BY J.H.Meluille
HUBIE CROPP’S niece stood with
her feet planted stolidly apart in
the grass. There was tine dignity
in the tilt of her chin.
“I don’t care what you think ; you had
no right, to spread those lies about Dad.”
She directed her censure at the seat of
her Uncle Hubie’s trousers shining out
from the agitation in the ivy hedge.
“Lunar Carey was up on Thursday.”
Her petulant sing-song fell away, be-
speaking the final humiliation: “He came
up to pray for Dad.”
“So business is as bad as that down
at Lunar’s timber-yard,” Hubie mused,
knocking the dirt off a tapering blue
bottle as he backed out, lean and un-
gainly, from the ivy. He looked up
sharply. “And did he kneel down by your
father’s bed, Rhoda; with his arms
stretched out along the bedclothes?”
He awaited the girl’s answer with ah
air that suggested thwarted ecstasy —
compounded vaguely of nobility and dis-
illusionment —a habitual fraud ; mislead-
ing by its flattery and false in its claim
on sentiment. His head, on its pitted
stalk of a neck, was long and narrow,
and an overgrowth of straw-colored hair
that had once been plastered down with
soap stood out now in spikes. A whim-
sical touch was lent by eyebrows that
curled out wonderingly from slanting,
hazel eyes.
“Stretched out like a hawk on a
fence?” he prompted.
“It’s just because Mr. Carey’s an under-
taker that people say those awful things
about him.”
The girl’s evasion was strained, hope-
fully arguing a case for self-deception.
“Then you didn’t see him turnin' his
head a bit—sort of taking a screw along
his arms?” he asked. The absurdity of
his suspicions moved him to a pained
chuckle.
“As if he might have been measurin’
your dad up, like?”
She bit her lip. “I don’t know.”
“But your dad had something to say?”
“He was asleep.”
“My word, wouldn’t he have had some-
thing to say?”
A consistent retort was apparently be-
yond the girl's comprehension. Fresh,
enriched emergence from adolescence had
wrought its wizardry with the pouting
cast of her features and left her em-
barrassed —almost intimidated, it seemed
—by new responsibilities. She was bare-
legged and tidy in a short blue dress. A
distasteful fascination held her there at
the hedge.
Hubie transferred his disappointment
to the bottle he’d brought out of the
hedge. It glinted as he turned it criti-
cally in his hands,
“No market for this fancy stuff, you
know, Rhoda.” He stroked the bottle
sadly, “Just what I was saying to the
manager of the depot the other day:
‘George,’ I says, ‘there’s too much of this
fancy stuff about,’ I says.”
His niece wasn’t impressed. She tossed
her head.
“You shouldn’t be gathering bottles on
Sunday,”
“I reckoned I’d kill two birds with one
stone, as the saying goes,” he explained
somewhat ruefully. “I’ll just go through
the ivy again while I’m up seein’ your
dad, I thinks to myself.” He placed the
bottle in the sack beside him. “She still
stands at sixteen, then.”
“Mr. Carey wouldn’t have come up if
you hadn’t spread lies,” the girl persisted.
Hubie hedged with an ingratiating grin
that slid feebly out from the stubbly
creases round his mouth. He had none
of the pride that bars humility as a
refuge.
“Ah well, Rhoda, when our time
comes, it comes,” he consoled sagely, and
reached out for her arm.
She jerked back.
“I’m the only one that knows how bad
he is; nobody else understands him 1 ”
Her defence was vehement. “He’s been
worse before! He was worse when you
Were painting the house. He didn’t tell
you he was going to die?”
She was restrained by uncertainty,
and the real truth of her fear was out.
“Your dad said no more than a word
or two about me helpin’ the bee widow
while he was down to it.”
She stamped her foot. “Then you had
no right to spread those lies!”
“But, my word, Rhoda, wouldn’t Lunar
go away thinking what a snug place
you’ve got up here on the hill?”
“I don’t care about that.”
He turned to admire a trim little cot-
tage that, with a single chimney-pot
poking up, stood bashfully slantwise to
the road. A sagging trellis gay with
sweet-peas ran across the section and
cut off a patch of potatoes from the sheds
on the far side,
“A pity we couldn’t just have struck
the tone-up,” he murmured, pushing
again into the ivy and pawing out for
bottles.
Hubie spoke wistfully of the “tone-up”
—an elusive refinement of the house-paint-
ing job that had tempted him down from
his rabbiter’s bach the summer before.
BACK in those days the tone-up had
begun to insinuate its demands soon
after his first roaring assault on the cot-
tage with his blowlamp. Its mixing ritual,
observed with commentary in the back
shed, was pro-
longed by dis-
heartening “try-
ou t s.” H e
grimly re-
counted the
odds against
him. But the
prospect o f
blackened
w e atherboards
was faced un-
daunted each
time he left
Quinn’s cart
at the cross-roads and set a bold course
for the cottage crouching askew in the
lee of hill scrub ; for pursuit of the tone-
up led Hubie regularly to test the opinion
of the Ploughman bar, and even the
company of Angus Quinn, from the old
toll-house, was preferable to a dusty walk
home.
Then there was the solitude imposed by
long planning, while beyond his bed-
room window smoke-haze spiked by
random poplars softly overlay the roof-
tops of the township, and the starling on
the chimney-pot sang for the girl fetching
water up from the creek. Nowhere did
his off-handed geniality rise higher in ad-
versity than at the meal-table; trailing
fumes of turpentine and linseed oil as
he flopped about in unlaced canvas shoes,
he shrank huge helpings to a mouthful
with the gust of his attack and his cry of
“What’s our little Rhododendron got for
us this time?” If, through it all, Hubie
yearned for his bach among the tussock
and boulders he hid it well.
All that summer he courted the tone-
up. He was twice cheated of success by
“the drying.”
But bitterness gradually set the key for
his chatter in the back shed. “Little Miss
Head-in-the-air,” he mocked one day at
a paint-pot. “Grudgin’ even a civil word.
Lookin’ down your nose at a man as if
he was dirt.” He sat on an upturned
box, nodding vigorously. “That’s you,
all right; the old lady all over again.”
The mockery went on, but not a
whisper of “Sponger” came from the fiery
red mouth of the paint-pot
He heard no criticism, either, when
he pleaded his case one day in Quinn’s
cart:
“I can see her game; oh, yes, I can
see it,” he ranted on a homeward trip
from the Ploughman. “Her with her nose
in the air. She wants to get rid of me,
that’s it. Gratitude!”
His soliloquy flowed round the unheed-
ing hulk of Angus Quinn. “Too proud
for the likes of me.” He leaned down
confidentially and brought Quinn’s ear
into focus.
“She got that from her mother, you
know —that was my sister Beth —and
Beth got it from her mother.”
“Arrh,” Quinn said.
Thus encouraged, Hubie surveyed with
virtuous scorn the image of his niece
floating alongside the cart.
“Right, you high-and-mighty little
bitch. I’ll go!” he shouted, and turned
apologetically to Quinn. “She’s the old
lady all over again,” he explained.
“Knowin’ more about you than you do
yourself.”
“Arrh,” Quinn said.
“Unworthy?”
Hubie tossed up the word and the wind
whisked it unresolved over the tailboard.
He sighed and settled back in resignation.
“She got it from her mother, and she
got it from her mother.”
That was the end of it, damning and
inevitable.
HE had struck a wounded compromise
with the tone-up and packed his
swag. The township had taken him in at
its own valuation and, as an alternative
to starvation, Hubie was soon nursing
a battered truck round the countryside
and confronting housewives with the title
of H. Cropp, marine dealer’s agent.
Hubie tossed another bottle into his
sack. “Twenty-four or twenty-five?”
His niece didn’t answer. She was press-
ing into the hedge further along.
“She stands at twenty-four, Rhoda.”
He swept the foliage aside at a spot
where the macrocarpa skeleton of the
hedge had been destroyed by the groping,
tufted tentacles of the ivy,
“Aha,” he observed, staring down
across the gully, “the bee widow busy
over at the manager’s place.”
“She gives us section honey from the
hive next to the gate,” the girl boasted.
“We get it for Dad helping her. They’re
black bees, Dad says.”
The manager’s place it is still called,
though since soon after that night when
the people of the township left their own
firesides to gather in the gully and watch
Monty Hanson’s two-storey house burn
to the ground there has been no more
need for a manager than for the coal-
stage that stands rotting among the gofsc
further up the mine road.
Sheep graze there now behind an orna-
mental stone wall. Sheds are tumbling
down under the bluegums, relics of habi-
tation. But the bee widow’s hives, ranged
in the shelter of the hawthorn, seem
somehow, by the very boldness of their
symmetry, to favor the forlorn dignity
of Monty Hanson’s old stone wall.
“Their comb’s as white and smooth as
anything,” the girl went on, “and when
I put it out on the yellow pansy plate it
looks so nice that I could never be the
first to cut it open.”
Hubie had a
speculative eye .
on the bee widow.
She was a dumpy
woman in a
broad white hat. -
Spangles o n
her dress flashed
in the sun as she
worked over a
hive, and whitish
wisps from her
smoker hung
faintly in the air.
“Your Dad
must have been
gettin’ to be a good hand with the bees,”
he said.
The girl bridled up, regretting her own
conciliatory lapse. “He’ll be back at
them, too. And you can think what you
like.”
Hubie kept on staring across the gully.
“There were three carloads of men up
from the saleyards on Thursday, too,”
she said. “They tramped muck all
through the house, and one of the last
lot swore at me because Dad was asleep
and I kept them out like the doctor told
me to.”
Frowning, he turned from the hedge.
“What was the man like?”
“A little man, he was ; nearly bald, and
with whiskers growing out of his ears.”
“About as little as your Dad?”
“Yes.”
“It’s just what I’ve always said,” he
concluded thoughtfully. “It’s the little
men that make the quickest swearers.”
“Dad never swore in the house.”
“But, my word, couldn’t he make up
for it in the gravel-pit!”
The girl’s protest wasn’t to be shunted
off so easily.
“Those men wouldn’t have come if you
hadn’t spread lies.”
Hubie gestured happily at a handker-
chief being waved from a window shaded
by the water-tank.
“Your Dad”
“He’s awake!”
She swung away easily across the grass.
<<\\l ELL, Dick, I see the mob down
» * the road got a win with their little
trotter,” Hubie called by way of greeting.
He was poking about in a final search
for bottles. “There’d be froth flyin’ down
at the homestead last night.”
He hoisted the sack on his back and
went sauntering across to the house.
“Goodness,” he heard the girl retort,
“you’d think I didn’t want you to talk
to Uncle Hubie.”
“Didn’t go along myself,” Hubie went
on unconcerned, “Buy your own beer,
I say, and you haven’t got that mob
countin’ every sip you take.”
He laid down his sack and lounged
back against the tank.
The man propped up in his bed by
the window was opening and closing his
mouth as if he might speak at any time,
but there came only the half-wheezing,
half-growling of his fight for breath. His
jowls hung grey and lifeless, and in his
eyes—the brown, wide-set eyes of his
daughter—vitality was burning out in
that sunless box of a room. The girl
stood back primly appraising, taking
points from the sweet-peas by the bed-
side and the artistic parting of her father’s
lank grey hair. The ultimate fraud of
her own ripe lips was in his too, blue-
tinged and shrunken.
“And the old lady’s the meanest of
the lot,” Hubie declared.
The girl stood back out of earshot,
watching moodily.
“The widow’s —at her—bees?” The
man through the window forced out his
question in a series of grunts.
Hubie nodded. “I fixed it with her.
I’ll be up to give her a hand next Sun-
day.”
“The supers—get too heavy.”
“Don’t you worry your head about
that, Dick, I’ll be there to give her a lift
off with the boxes till you’re right again,”
Hubie promised.
He leaned through the window, his
elbows on the sill, and tried to straighten
the leering twist of his mouth.
“Ah, that bee-sting cure you made up
for her —any sort of feather does to put
it on with, eh, Dick?”
Such innocence brought a stricken
moan, and Hubie hastened to gloss over
his blunder:
“That brown stuff in the bottle behind
the shed door, that’s it?”
“In the honey-house.”
“That’s it,” Hubie affirmed eagerly.
“The end one of them old sheds.”
The man inside the window closed his
eyes.
“It’s just like you were sayin’ last
Sunday,” Hubie ventured, not risking a

The Eagle and the Fish-hawk.
Reckoning in miles, between the hills and
the sea.
From the scarp and the unnumbered
trees, not far to go :
A road which changes imperceptibly
To the cliff’s edge and the restless waves
below.
Over the rain-swept hills the eagle
hovers;
Alert for shining shoals the fish-hawk
glides —
To the eye near earth there is little
difference
Between the bird of the crags and the
bird of the tides.
This they hold in common with all their
race,
Power and strength and air-wrapped
mystery;
But the hawk would find no prey in the
shadowed grass
And the eagle starve above a fish-filled
sea.
There were two, and among the *rocks
and the brackish creeks
They loved; when the gum-leaves hung
straight down from the heat
Love followed twisted tracks in damp
fern valleys.
Was brewed with tea from a billy, black
and sweet.
It may have been, lost on the brief miles
of the road
Or have hidden in a curved red shell on
the sands.
Only t§ sigh to some sad listener
Holding all beauty in unknowing hands.
Or again, perhaps they feed so differ-
ently —
Love that can be still and silent and wait.
And the other, the ocean-restless, storm-
wracked, surging:
The-eagle and the fish-hawk never mate.

UNCABLED ADDITIONS
IRON CURTAIN TROUBLES.
(Based on reports, articles, etc,, from their acknowledged sources .)
Who Started It?
When U.S. Secretary for State Byrnes
lost patience with the Russian tactics at
the Paris conference there should have
been no surprise. He merely expressed
exasperated feeling evidenced in the U.S.
press for months past—in papers that
have all along been very fair to the
Soviet as well as those that have had their
doubts.
A N.Y. “Times” correspondent de-
clared that “while official Washington
does not know where the vicious circle is
going to end, it at least feels reasonably
sure where the circle started.” The writer
went on to quote Washington official
observations on where and how the rot
began. “It was not London or Washing-
ton but Moscow that started dividing the
Continent into blocs. It was Stalin who
insisted, against the protests of Churchill,
on making the first bilateral treaty with
Czechoslovakia. It was Moscow that
built the ‘Eastern bloc’ before Field-
Marshal Smuts ever mentioned the ‘Wes-
tern bloc.’ ”
The writer pointed out that similarly it
was Moscow that insisted on the closed
economic zone in Eastern Europe,
lowered the “iron curtain” from Stettin
to Trieste, and closed the Danube to free
international commerce. Also, “it was
not an American or a British idea to
divide Germany and Austria into water-
tight zones,” nor was it Britain but the
Soviet that rejected the U.S. proposal
for a joint trusteeship of Tripolitania,
which would have had the effect of bring-
ing Russia into the Mediterranean as a
co-operating administrative Power.
Nor were U.S. and Britain first “to
gather together and retain as units parts
of the German General Staff, nor were
they the authors of the political and
territorial settlement of Eastern Europe.”
In Washington, the writer went on,
“officials are convinced that the Rus-
sians, like the Germans before them, are
creating all the things they fear the most;
that by building up the Eastern bloc they
invited the Western bloc ; that by trying
to divide U.S. from the British they have
driven it closer to the British; that by
using the veto so freely in the United
Nations and in the councils of the Big
Four they are destroying the veto ; and
that by crying for the imperialistic
dreams of the Tsars they are encourag-
ing a kind of economic military imperial-
ism in the United States.”
Journalists Tour the Zones
Fourteen outstanding American jour-
nalists went on a conducted tour of U.S.-
occupied Germany and Austria. One of
them, Pittsburg “Press” editor Edward
T. Leech, reported that ordinary troops
in Berlin and Austria know better than
to wander in the Russian zones. To them
Russian territory is hostile ground where
they face imprisonment or violence.
“American aviators flying over Russian
zones to Berlin or Vienna keep within
narrow lanes, lest they be attacked by
Russian fliers in U.S. lend-lease ’planes.
Four such attacks occurred in Aystria in
one week,
“Wherever you go in the American zone
you hear tales of incidents between Russia
and her Allies. You hear the same dis-
cussions outside Germany. After a year
of peace two great fears hang over .the
devastated countries. One is fear of
hunger. The other is fear of what Russia
plans to do.”
Mr. Leech added: “If you heard them
only here and there you might put stories
about Russia down to warmongering. But
you hear them everywhere. Everywhere
it was ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’.” And, he
continued, “never any answer to the ques-
tion, ‘What makes the Russians act that
way: what are they up to?’ ”
In Berlin the journalists were permitted
into the Russian zone only far enough
to see where Hitler and Eva Braun were
reported to have died, and then there
were a Russian captain and an armed
soldier conducting them. When the party
went from Vienna to Salzburg there was
a Russian pilot locomotive ahead and an-
other behind.
Mr. Leech reported that what is going on
in Germany and Austria prevails as well
elsewhere. “A state resembling an armed
truce exists in the Istrian peninsula just
north of the Adriatic Sea. There are
roadblocks along every highway to pre-
vent traffic between the zones, and Yugo-
slav arid American soldiers face each
other over a narrow no-man’s land into
which neither side ventures.” He said
that even the U.S. Graves Registration
Service trying to seek out the bodies
of missing American airmen so they can
be buried or their fates cleared up “works
under the greatest restrictions in every
Balkan country where Russia is now
supreme.”
The chief explanations he heard why
this iron curtain of secrecy and hostility
exists were :
1. —Mental habit. The Russians have
surrounded their own country with
secrecy for so long that they naturally
extend the same system to the occupied
territories.
2. —Fear of letting the Russian soldiers
learn about the rest of the world ; a desire
to keep them from knowing that Ameri-
can soldiers eat better and dress better
and have watches and cameras and other
consumer articles which Russians can’t
get.
3. —A sort of inferiority complex; a
desire to keep the rest of the world from
seeing how badly off the Russians are.
4. —Military strategy to conceal the fact
that Russia hasn’t demobilised ; that she
still has perhaps five million soldiers in
Europe ready to sweep over the Con-
tinent, if necessary. There are many re-
ports that Russia has kept great reserves
of tanks and guns and ’planes in occupied
territories.
“Travelling through the American occu-
pied zones in Europe, after a full year
of peace,” the writer concluded, “I
couldn’t help feeling that it looks any-
thing but peaceable.”
‘‘Differences in Moscow”
A N.Y. “Times” London correspondent
wrote that, attempting to analyse the Soviet
Union’s intransigence on international
affairs. Viscount Cecil suggested that there
exists “a vigorous difference of opinion
at Moscow, the issue of which is so
doubtful that neither party can afford to
agree to foreign proposals, however
reasonable.”
“I do not pretend to understand
Russian policy,” Lord Cecil declared,
“The Soviet Government has every reason
to desire peace, but it does not seem to
realise that international organisation can
only be secured by agreement based on
compromise.”
Lord Cecil quoted a passage from Tom
Brown’s Schooldays to describe Molo-
tov’s policy: “He never wants any-
thing but what is right or fair,
only when you come to settle what
is right and fair it’s everything that
he wants and nothing that you want.
That’s his idea of compromise.”
International peace cannot be built on
this sort of compromise. Lord Cecil re-
marked. “I cannot understand,” he said,
“why men of the great ability of the
Russian statesmen do not perceive this
self-evident truth.”
A Resort to Irony
A month or so back Brooks Atkinson,
who had been N.Y. “Times” correspon-
dent in Moscow, returned to America,
since when he has been saying all that
the Moscow censorship prevented him
from sending to his paper. His successor.
Drew Middleton, is either asking for the
quick kick-out or has adopted irony as a
means of getting past the solemn censor-
ship. Mr. Middleton began one report:
“The Soviet citizen, pushing through the
crowds in the Moscow subway these hot
mornings on his way to work, should be a
very happy man. From reading his news-
papers and listening to the radio he
knows that things almost everywhere are
worse than in the Soviet Union and that,
although his motherland is again faced
with Imperialism and Fascism, it is pro-
tected by the mightiest army in the
world.”
Mr. Middleton wrote that the “coming
of the atomic age” had “only slightly
affected the Russian citizen.” He knows
that there is such a thing as the atomic
bomb, but in the newspapers and in lec-
tures he has been told that the bomb is
extremely expensive to make and not as
effective as the bombs used by most of
the Powers in World War 11.
Also, “he looks forward confidently to
the end of rationing in the Soviet Union,
as promised by Stalin, and he sees
more consumer goods in the big shops,
although the prices are still just a wee bit
beyond him.
“Nevertheless he is confident that the
Soviet economy is prospering and that
the economy of the capitalist countries is
on the downgrade.
“It is not surprising that, as he scans
headlines such as ‘Terrorist Activities of
Ku FClux Klan in America,’ he feels safe
and well-off,
“Things are going to get better under
the new Five Year Plan. Hasn’t M. V.
Sarycheva told the Supreirte Soviet that
‘a large proportion of capital investments
will go to improvements in the living con-
ditions of the workers’?
“Soon his wife may have a gas fire to
cook by, for Mr. Sarycheva promises
that under the Five Year Plan the con-
struction of the Saratov-Moscow gas pipe
will be completed.”
Mr. Middleton concluded: “He glances
at another headline, which says, ‘Workers’
Demonstration in Holland.’ He shakes
his head over the difficulties that foreign
workers have to face.”
A writer in Washington “Post,” one
of the most friendly of U.S. papers to
Russia, has been driven practically to
accepting Churchill’s suggestion for a
U.S.-British alliance: “If Russia con-
tinues to pursue an aggressive course, if
she continues to set aside agreements she
has made in order to secure special
advantages, an Anglo-American alliance
will become not merely a necessity but
an inevitability. We [U.S.] had no alli-
ance with Britain when we went to war
with Germany in 1917 and there was none
in existence when, in 1939, we began to
throw our weight on Britain’s side. This
action, on our part, was the result of
imperious necessity. By the same token,
an Anglo-American alliance will become
a reality, in fact if not in name, if Russia,
by her actions, proves that there are no
limits to what Churchill has described as
her ‘expansive and proselytising tenden-
cies.’ If Russia wants to avoid the setting-
up of an Anglo-American alliance, she
can do so most easily by showing that
she is prepared to act and live as a nation
with which, as they desperately want her
to, other nations can live in peace and
harmony and friendship and co-opera-
tion.”
“A Weak America”
N.Y. “Journal-American” has taken
the line that Russia’s leaders want a weak
America and are well aware of the in-
adequacy and impotence of current
American military preparations.
“They know perfectly well that in less
than a year’s time since the end of the
war the United States has almost com-
pletely dissipated and dissolved its once
mighty military organisation and that no-
where in the world are the remaining
American military forces formidable or
capable of being an international menace.
“They know equally well that the
United States has failed almost ludi-
crously in its timid and futile efforts to
keep its military organisation intact
through voluntary enlistment, and that the
instruments of conscription approved by
Congress will produce no better result.
“By contrast, Russia has never ceased to
be completely and permanently mobilised,
and on a war footing. Russia’s vast and
unreduced and unimpaired military forces
have not only been kept continuously
ready for war, but have been constantly
engaged in warlike manoeuvres and have
been actively conducting actual and
aggressive war ever since the collapse of
the German and Japanese empires.”
The “Journal-American” went on to
point out that, in addition to total mobili-
sation, Russia continues conscription of
all possible manpower.
“Consequently, Soviet Russia has be-
come—by the defeat of her once powerful
enemies, and by the default and decline
of her once powerful allies —the most
potent and formidable military Power in
the world; in fact, the only military
Power in the world today that is capable
of aggression.
“But, plainly enough, Russia is not con-
tent with her present and great advantage
as the only nation in the world fully pre-
pared for war Russia is disclosing her
real and arrogant and ruthless intentions.
“The Russian concept of ‘international
co-operation and world peace’ is that of
world rule by Russia, with all other
nations ‘co-operating’ as subject States
and their people submitting to the ‘peace’
of slavery.”
WHAT KIND OF GERMANY?
(From reports and articles, etc., from various acknowledged sources .)
In February this year it was announced
throughout Germany that a competition
would be held for the design for a post-
age stamp* best portraying the reconstruc-
tion of the country on a democratic basis.
The competition was conducted by the
four occupying Powers. Entries from
nationals were called for, and the designs
were to have been judged in March.
There has been no decision yet, nor any
real suggestion when one might be made.
A N.Y, “Times” correspondent de-
clares that “the incident is typical of the
diplomatic snarls inherent even in the
most minor problems demanding unani-
mity among the four nations currently
administering Germany.” It is rumored
that the hold-up in this instance is the
responsibility of the French representa-
tives and “their antipathy to anything
which could possibly symbolise the unifi-
cation of Germany—even a postage
stamp.”
The Paris peacemakers, while very
much concerned over questions of pro-
cedure, do not even pretend to have any
sort of scheme, certainly no sort of treaty,
ready for Germany, arid this well into
the second year after the war with Ger-
many ended. The peacemakers of Ver-
sailles, though roundly criticised on prac-
tically all grounds, did finish the job they

had to do by providing treaties for Ger-
many and all her allies within a year of
the cessation of the hostilities which
were their concern. There is to be no
hurry this time, and it seems that Ger-
many, and to a large extent the rest of
Europe, too, will just have to muddle
along indefinitely, without much hope
of re-establishing any form of interlinked
economy.
Reasons for the delay in formulating
any overall plan for the reconstitution of
the German State are laid variously at
many doors. France is to blame;
Russian-British (or Russian-American or
American-British) rivalry is the cause;
dissension among the Germans them-
selves is responsible; the majority of
Germans are too apathetic ; the majority
of Germans belong to some one. or other
fanatically interested group.
Allied Rivalry .
Writing in the N.Y. “Times,” Harold
Callender gives one view. “Many Ger-
mans,” he says, “observe the apparent
deadlock of conflicting Allied policies to-
ward Germany, and once again—as after
World War I —they place their hope for
the recovery of German independence
and power in what seems to be the in-
evitable rivalry among Germany’s con-
querors,
“After World War I it was chiefly the
rivalry between a then-powerful France
and a Britain that feared French power
and sought to strengthen Germany to off-
set it. This time the rivalry is chiefly be-
tween a victorious but weakened Britain
and a victorious but weakened Russia,
each of which looks upon Germany as a
probably useful ally against the other.”
Callender goes on to state that the
U.S. attitude is that Germany must be
restored. “Just as we are engaged in the
somewhat paradoxical process of impos-
ing democracy upon Japan, through the
instrumentality of a military dictator, so
we are trying in Germany to revive such
democratic forces as exist in a period
when German sovereignty does not exist.
The paradox is intensified by the fact that
what we consider to be democratic forces
are not what Russia considers democratic
forces, so that in our zone and in the
adjoining Russian zone the directive is
the same but the application is totally
different.
“This sharp divergence on the ideologi-
cal level is reproduced in every otner
sphere. It touches notably the basic ques-
tion of the capacity of Germany to liVe
physically. U.S. authorities contend
that the first step in any German policy
is to enable the Germans to eat and to
pay for their food by exports as far as
possible. The Russian policy of seizing
German machinery Interferes with this
aim.”
Russia and Reparations
The plan drawn up at Potsdam by Tru-
man, Stalin and Attlee visualised a Ger-
many that would never again have the
economic or military power to make
war, but in the “World Report” view
“Allied performance has delayed recon-
struction and recovery in Europe as well
as in Germany, and has divided the
Allies, leaving Germany in a position to
play one against the other. Net result of
Potsdam to date is that, while Germany
cannot now make war, neither can the
Allies make peace.”
The Potsdam decision was to reduce
Germany to the position of a third-rate
industrial Power. “A European economy
centred on German industry was to be
reoriented to rising economic centres to
the east and west.” It was hoped that
by 1949 Germany would be self-support-
ing, though the standard of living was to
be no higher than that of 1932. Such in-
dustry and equipment as was no longer
allowed to Germany was to be used for
reparations. Russia had the right to take
what she chose from her zone of occu-
pation, and besides receive 25 per cent,
of the industry allocated for reparations
in the other zones. A ball-bearing plant,
chemical works, an aircraft engine plant
and a shipyard were included among the
first shipments to Russia from the U.S.
zone. Then the U.S. ordered the sending
of reparations to stop.
A writer in the “World Report” gives
the reasons for the order:
“What has happened is this: Russia
has refused to agree to common policies
for trade between zones,' for pooling im-
ports from outside Germany, or for a
uniform standard of food consumption.
The Russian zone resembles Russia more
and more. Big estates have been broken
up and turned over to the peasants, and
a start has been made in turning big in-
dustry over to the workers. Eastern
Germany thus faces toward Russia and
away from the West

ised administration of the German

economy until the other Allies agree to
separation of the Ruhr and Rh.neland.
Now France threatens to strip the Saar of
industry unless this area, at least, is
divorced from Germany and made part
of France.
“Britain would like to see the coal and
steel of the Ruhr provide Germany and
all Europe with the means of reconstruc-
tion. The British prefer an industrialised
Ruhr and Germany under Allied control
to a dismantled and poverty-stricken
Germany under Communist control. But
British ability to revive coal and steel
production, even to the low limits per-
mitted by Potsdam, is hamstrung by-
shortages of food and raw materials.
“The U.S. in its zone has to provide
imports of food and raw materials that
Potsdam said would be coming from other
parts of Germany. So now the U.S. says
that either the Allies treat Germany as
an economic unit or reparations stop.”
The “World Report” writer claims that
reparations are more important to Russia
than they are to the other Allies, that the
Soviet is desperately in need of machinery
and equipment and, if she has hopes of
a warm weather port, of shipbuilding
capacity. The question whether her need
for reparations will lead her to com-
promise on the issues now dividing the
Allies and preventing a form of settle-
ment for the Germany-to-be, is still un-
solved.
Nazi Underground
There are other factors which cloud the
future of Germany. The “Atlantic
Monthly” reports on the disappointing
results that have so far attended the cam-
paign to re-educate the German people.
“A year of experience with the Ger-
mans in defeat has punctured our hope
that their re-education is feasible through
efforts from the outside. The Russians,
too, appear to be badly stymied, not-
withstanding the pressure exerted by
Communist political agents. The simple
fact is that there are not enough depend-
able teachers in Germany to undertake
this work.
“There is little doubt that Nazi secret
organisations are functioning today in the
Russian zone, regardless of the risks.
Certainly they are operating in the
American zone. There is an obvious con-
nection between these carriers of Nazi
infection and the obstacles which have
reduced the re-education programme to
something perilously akin to grim jest.
“Lack of suitable teachers has com-
pelled the Alhed Military Government to
choose between closing the schools and
making the uest of a hopeless situation.
As a result, the educational system con-
tinues to pump the essentials of the
‘master race’ doctrine into thousands of
German children. At the higher levels
evidences of a revival of Nazi doctrines
are even clearer. Thinly disguised attacks
on the Allies, sardonic criticism of occu-
pation policies and skilful playing-up of
the tenets of German nationalism have
been noted in recent conferences of Ger-
man educators. At the universities
swarms of discharged young Wehrmacht
officers carry on continuous sabotage of
all efforts to restore the old liberal tradi-
tion. The movement is not limited to the
schools. It has begun to emerge in the
realm of politics and community life.”
The “Atlantic Monthly” takes an ex-
ceedingly grave view of the situation. It
believes a “reign of terror is in the mak-
ing,” and it points out that “by leaning
heavily on German conservatives, most of
whom did not hesitate to lend ardent
support to Hitler, and all of whom are
devotees of resurgent German national-
ism, the A.M.G. is multiplying its diffi-
culties.”
It is impossible to dismiss every German
who may have had connections with Hitler’s
regime A great many of these people
merely bent to the wind of necessity. Yet
the fact remains that both in German indus-
try and in German civil posts hundreds of
extremely dangerous individuals with very
bad records hold places with A.M.G.
approval. ,
Central G’ment and Peace—l94B
But the “Atlantic Monthly’s” forecast
as to when Germany, and the world, may
expect a peace treaty is almost equally
alarming, as is its understanding of the
length of time it may be necessary to
“supervise” the country by an Allied
Commission:
“The political integration of the Reich
is still a problem for the future. General
Clay [Deputy Military Governor] in the
American zone believes that the creation
of a central government and the framing
of a new constitution for Germany may
be managed before the end of 1948. The
Allies could then reduce the present con-
trols to a joint commission supported by
small, streamlined military units drawn
from France, Britain, America and
Russia.
“ the continuance of Allied super-
vision over a period possibly lasting as
long as 25 years, as proposed by Secre-
tary Byrnes, is simply an insurance policy.
The framing of a peace treaty for Ger-
many must of necessity await the re-
establishment of a unified Germany and
a German Government which can be
held to account.”
1948! It seems a long time hence.
The “World Report” on the other hand
claims that the pattern for a new, feder-
ated Germany is already being cut.
“Three semi - autonomous States —
Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and Greater
Hesse —have been federated within the
U.S. zone. To this nucleus the British
and French may contribute the six Ger-
man States in their zones* The Federa-
tion thus created would contain 47 mil-
lion Germans and 64 per cent, of Ger-
many’s pre-war industry facing Russia’s
zone with 21 million Germans and only
23 per cent, of German industry.”
Federation Plans
It is claimed that the new Federation
is already “smashing breaches through
barriers which hitherto have divided Ger-
many into four zones and have blocked
European recovery. German officials from
the Federation capital at Stuttgart are
making trade deals with other Germans
from the British, French and even the
Russian zones.”
If the States from the Russian zone
stay out a Federation from the remainder
of Germany could still meet at Stuttgart.
With the “Russian” States in, a 12-State
Federation meeting at Berlin would con-
stitute a re-united Germany.
Under the present system each of the
three member States is headed by a
minister-president, chosen by the Deputy
Military Governor. “These minister-
presidents choose cabinet members who
choose State and city officials —and so it
goes all the way down to the local dog-
catcher.” Gradually these officials have
been given greater responsibility.
“The Federation is directed by the
Council of Minister-Presidents or Laen-
derrat. The three minister-presidents and
their deputies meet with a Laenderrat
secretary once a month. These seven
Germans now handle most of the busi-
ness of governing 19 million Germans,
They exercise more power than any other
Germans in the world today.”
The A.M.G. rarely intervenes now in
civil affairs below the Laenderrat level.
The Federation handles food distribution
and industrial planning, including the dis-
tribution of raw materials. A start has
been made'towards interzonal trade.
“The U.S. is now opening the German
Federation she has created to co-operation
with German States in other zones. But
the U.S. will not wait for all other Ger-
man States to go along before doing what
now can be done in Germany to help
Europe toward economic recovery.”

DID "LABOR" SAVE US?
We are beginning to hear again, especi-
ally from non-starters in any war save the
class war and ballot-box battles, that
“Labor” Saved the Country, and there
will be a great deal more of this stuff
before the electors go to the polls.
Three years ago it had the desired effect.
“Labor” succeeded in its appeal to large
sections of people who had seldom or
never voted “Labor” before: irrational
Menzies-haters, dupes of Communist
agitators, assisted by smart Left-wing
journalists; those who were too ready to
believe that the war was as good as won
and that “Labor” had a right to ask —as
“Labor” did —for a mandate to “prepare
the peace” ; and those others who, while
killing Hirohito with their mouths, looked
to “Labor” to save Alfie and Willie from
having to fight those horrid Japs. But
it won’t go down this time.
It can’t go down this time because
there are too many men about with
first-hand knowledge of grim facts,
concealed from the nation three
years ago, and of grim or grimmer
sequels. Men who survived the 1942
campaigns in New Britain, Amboina,
Timor, Java, and Singapore, and
who know how ill-equipped and ill-
supplied were all the forces engaged
there. Men whose thoughts turn from
their own sufferings, which have set an
ever-present mark on many, to the suf-
ferings which closed in death for so many
of their companions ; who cannot forget
the Sandakan death march, the many hell-
camps or the horrors of the Siam-Burma
railway, and who laugh bitterly when
they see the cool, calm, iron-willed
“Government” of propaganda fiction
showing the white feather whenever Com-
munist larrikins issue their orders and
yielding even to the uncouth pranks of
N.S.W. coalmine whelps; wheelers.
Though the Japanese surrender was a
year old on August 14, Australia has
not even yet learned from its “Govern-
ment” how many of our countrymen re-
turned from the campaigns lost in the
first quarter of 1942 when “Labor” was
Saving the Country. Every scrap of
official information concerning them, and
it doesn’t amount to much, has had to be
dragged out of the “Government.” None
of these tragedies was ever debated, not
even that of Singapore, which means
that Mr. Forde was never called to
account for his pledge of succor to the
doomed garrison:
It will go, not as a few consignments
from a shrinking store, but as a stream
which will swell to a flood and a flood
which will grow to an overwhelming torrent.
Yet such of the dreadful truth as has
been brought home by survivors and
dragged out of the “Government” should
ensure a suitable reception for Mr. Ward
should he venture on a repetition, with
new variations, of the Brisbane Line lie,
as he concocted it the wickedest ever
minted in the brain of a political larrikin ;
and it is expected that he will, Mr.
Chifley’s qualms notwithstanding.
The Brisbane Line lie was launched at
Perth in May, 1943, in characteristic
Wardian terms.
Until the Curtin Government came into
office the defence plan provided for all of
Australia south of a line north of Brisbane,
and following a diagonal course to a point
north of Adelaide, to be abandoned to the
enemy. Labor’s predecessors in office were
defeatist in outlook.
Mr. Curtin sullied his reputation by giving
his authority to the monstrous impeach-
ment, with disingenuous modifications.
On Japan coming into the war the
C.-in-C. Home Forces appointed by the
Menzies Government submitted to the
Minister for the Army proposals for the
defence of Australia, the essence of which
was concentration on the defence of vital
parts. This involved holding what • is
known as the Brisbane Line. The Gov-
ernment rejected the submission and took
steps to defend the whole continent.
Realising that he had gone too far, at
least on one point, Mr. Curtin made a
show of “refusing to allow the C.-in-C.
Home Forces,” who had added to his
First World War reputation by his leader-
ship of the Sixth Division in North
Africa, “to be the scapegoat of any con-
troversy about the so-called Brisbane
Line”—it had been “so-called” only by
Mr. Ward and himself. But borrowing an
infamous expression from Mr. Ward he
asserted that his predecessors’ “home-
defence plan” had been “defeatist in out-
look and preparation.” This was a deadly
insult, in particular to Mr. Menzies, who
had offered to step down and serve under
Mr. Curtin conditionally on his forming
a national Government. Mr. Menzies
had set other examples for his successor
by bearding the striking N.S.W. coal-
miners in their den and visiting the A.I.F.
in a battle area. Mr. Curtin preferred to
scold the coalminers, and to thank the
Diggers and G.ls. fighting on Australian
territory, from the P.M.’s Lodge, Can-
berra.
In London last month Sir Leslie Wil-
son, who fought in Gallipoli and France,
and who was Governor of Queensland
in 1942, said that “when north-east Aus-
tralia seemed in imminent danger of
Japanese invasion a defence plan was
drawn up whereby the whole of Queens-
land north of Brisbane would be un-
defended.”
This Brisbane Line plan did not appeal
to me because it involved thousands of
people leaving northern towns.
If Mr. Ward and friends can get any
comfort from this statement, they are
welcome to it. But it acquits the Menzies
and Fadden Governments of all respon-
sibility for any such plan. Neither was
in office “when north-east Australia
seemed in imminent danger of a Japanese
invasion.” The Menzies Government re-
signed on August 29, 1941. The Fadden
Government went out and “Labor” came
in exactly two months before the Japan-
ese struck at Pearl Harbor.
When “Labor” had been in for nine
months, Mr. Johnson, the member for
Kalgooilie (now Minister for the Interior),
learned from Major-General Plant —as
he stated in the House on September 23,
1942—that “instructions had been re-
ceived” (from “Labor”) to “abandon all
the north-west of the continent.” “The
most northern defence line” was to be
“Moore River, 65 miles north of Perth
as the crow flies; with the forces and
equipment at my command,” Major-
General Plant said, “there is no alterna-
tive.” This suggests that the expectation
of another invasion that never came was
operating on “Labor’s” tail. Mr. John-
son nevertheless persuaded himself that
the hated Menzies was responsible, Mr.
Menzies having gone in for compulsory
recruitment and training for home de-
fence over “Labor’s” shrill objections.
For what happened in the island cam-
paigns “Labor,” and “Labor” alone, is
responsible to the nation; and lots
of things happened over which “Labor”
has drawn a veil, “Labor” has never
revealed that there were 100,000 malaria
cases among Australian servicemen in
the South-west Pacific. For this arrest-
ing and sobering information Aus-
tralia is indebted to Brigadier Hamilton
Fairley. The brigadier’s report, written
modestly in the third person, was not
printed as a State paper and tabled in
Parliament, as it should have been.
“Labor” left it to the “Medical Journal”
to publish a great contribution to the
history of the war, the work of a man
whose services to the nation, and those
of his coadjutors, all devoted to the pre-
vention and treatment of tropical diseases,
should never be forgotten.
Thanks to their noble exertions the
malaria death rate was not high: “one in
3000.” But it was severe in the case of
“252 men of the 2/22nd Battalion who
escaped from Rabaul at the end of Janu-
ary, 1942”: —
Their medical officer carried enough
quinine to treat malaria casualties for
, approximately a month. After this their
supplies of quinine became exhausted, and
50 men died from malignant tertian malaria
during the next five weeks before they
escaped from New Britain to New Guinea.
Practically all the survivors were infected
with the dangerous malignant tertian
malaria and the recurrent benign tertian
malaria as well.
At this dreadful sequel to a dreadful
business in what has become part of Mr.
Ward’s principality—he has been Minister
of External Territories, since September
21, 1943 —“Labor” has never so much as
hinted. And it left Brigadier Fairley to
reveal other appalling facts which, inci-
dentally, have a bearing on the re-
establishment of many thousands of
Diggers whose bodies are fever-wracked
still:
In June, 1942, Brigadier Hamilton Fairley
and Lt.-Col. Mackerras, Director of Ento-
mology,. Land Headquarters, found 50 per
cent, of troops in the dry Moresby area
already infected with malaria.
The campaigns of late 1942 and early
1943 (Milne Bay, Kokoda, Buna and Wau)
gave rise to thousands of cases of malaria,
many of them severe. Reinforcement of
the Milne Bay force in September and
October, together with an intense multipli-
cation of the malaria vector, laid the foun-
dation for a serious epidemic which, in
November and December, 1942, nearly
immobilised the Milne Bay force. During
the week ending December 25, 1083 patients
were admitted to hospital out of a total
strength of 12,000 men.
Meanwhile an arduous campaign was
being fought in central Papua. After heavy
fighting in the Owen Stanley Ranges Aus-
tralian troops encircled a Japanese force
at Buna-Gona The troops were thor-
oughly exhausted and underfed. They were
not equipped to protect themselves against
malaria. Consequently a huge outbreak
occurred in the course of three months’
heavy fighting in the coastal swamp. Actual
figures of the incidence of malaria are not
available, mainly because only seriously-ill
men were evacuated beyond regimental-aid-
posts. During the period October 23, 1942,
to April 24, 11,638 patients were
admitted to medical units, mostly from
troops operating at Buna and Wau. In the
last week in January, 951 cases were re-
ported; during the six months’ period in
Mew Guinea, 20,272 cases.
Concerning the Buna men, Brigadier
Fairley notes that, “on their return to
Australia in January-March, 1943, almost
all had one or more relapses of benign
tertian malaria,” These soldiers and
their mates from Milne Bay would scar-
cely be a fit audience for platform rhap-
sodies on the miracles performed by the
“Labor” Administration. Their reactions
would be altogether different, especially
if one of their number came armed with
Brigadier Fairley’s statement on the pro-
vision made for their comfort and safety:
During the whole of the Papuan cam-
paign anti-malaria precautions were not
carried out satisfactorily. There were grave
deficiencies in mosquito nets, protective
clothing, malaria-control equipment and
supplies, anti-malaria drugs, etc. The cam-
paign began without any malaria-control
units being established on the island.
This eminent Australian, whose fame
is now world-wide, had another reference
to mosquito nets in a chapter on “The
Struggle for Anti-Malaria Supplies, 1942-
43”):-
Mosquito nets were scarce in New
Guinea and of inferior quality, with such
a poor air-flow that troops experienced
great difficulty in sleeping under them in the
humid tropics.
In the first month of the war “Labor”
objected to the defence of the island terri-
tories, even Norfolk Island (under
“Labor’s” direction, garrisoned by troops
from little New Zealand), it being
an old idea of Mr. Ward’s, expressed
in his most scornful Paddington
strain, that the protection of Papua
and the Mandated Territories in par-
ticular should be left to “the ex-
ploiters,” meaning the handful of settlers.
But when island fighting had to be under-
taken, there being no alternative, the
least “Labor” could have done was to see
that the fighting men were amply and
continuously supplied with mosquito nets
of good quality. And it can’t blame
“Menzies” for its shocking and terrible
neglect or dismiss its Director of Medicine
as a “capitalistic” liar.
What "Labor" Has Lost.
A spark of idealism and a grain of
commonsense are necessary ingredients
in the make-up of any man worth his
salt. They are as essential as the solid
practical core that makes it possible for
a man to achieve his ends and the strain
of self-interest that directs his activities
and protects him from the impositions
of rogues. These four ingredients are no
less important to a political party than
to an individual. Possessing them a
party will flourish ; lacking them it will
run to seed, the prey of parasites and
racketeers from without and within.
In its origins the Labor party had all
four attributes. Today in Australia
“Labor,” warped and deformed, finds
little inspiration in the lives and ideals of
its early stalwarts. What idealism re-
mains is a hazy cloud fogging the vision
of men wading knee-deep through blue-
prints for Utopia. Commonsense,
strangled by prejudice and a gospel of
class hatred foreign to our race and breed,
is seldom permitted to gasp out a word
of reason, and on the rare occasions when
its voice is heard it is immediately howled
down by the rowdy majority as an echo of
conservatism or worse. At the same time
the practical core has degenerated into a
coarse materialism, and self-interest,
swollen to gross selfishness, has become
the guiding spirit in “Labor” activities.
“Labor’s” thoughts are for “Labor.”
The term “worker,” although in theory
all-embracing, in actual practice embraces
only those who embrace “Labor’s” poli-
tical theories and pay “Labor’s” political
levies. Let a worker try to buck the
machine and he ceases to be a “worker” ;
he becomes a “scab.” In some industries
a worker loses his right to the title of
worker if he works. It is fairly common
for union bosses to squabble over the
“ownership” of workers, with the conse-
quent right to collect their dues; in-
dustries have been held up and workers
thrown out of employment through these
tong feuds.
Production or non-production of coal
affects all Australia, and the central
Government’s responsibility and care
should be for all Australia. The
approach of Federal “Labor” to the
problem has seldom recognised this,
beyond a few platitudinous statements
that are treated with contempt by
the real rulers of the coal industry.
“Labor’s” policy all along has been one
of concessions and appeasement a
melancholy history of threats unfulfilled,
decisions reversed, fines remitted and
monotonous surrender to Communist-
dictated demands. Even when Mr.
Chifley or one of his colleagues is
'moved to a gentle rebuke of striking
miners, there is always implicit in the
chidings an apology for mentioning such
delicate subjects as work and production,
and a tacit recognition that it is really
the wicked owners who are to blame for
all the ills of the industry. In recent
weeks there has been a note of petulance
inspired by the nearness of the Federal
elections —a kind of pleading suggestion
that miners should bear their burden with
some show of patience a little longer,
say, till after September 28.
When the attitude of those who set the
standards for “Labor” is so lacking in
inspiration it is small wonder that the
behavior of the followers of “Labor”
should be along the lines of blind selfish-
ness.
Thus N.S.W. Government railwaymen
object to coal being sent to other States
while restricted timetables are in force
in N.S.W. That the lack of coal would
mean the complete cessation of some in-
dustries in other States seems to matter
not one chewed-up tram ticket to these
“Labor” idealists. Others take the view
that the N.S.W. Railway Department’s
requirements of coal should be met in full
before private industry gets a lump.
The N.S.W. council of the Locomotive
Enginemen is one union that has put this
selfish viewpoint into a recommendation
to the Sydney Labor Council (adopted),
singling out B.H.P. as its victim, and
ignoring the fact that B.H.P. employees—
fellow-unionists—would be the chief suf-
ferers if its suggestion is adopted. This
union’s solution of the problem is that
B.H.P.’s quota should be cut down to its
1944 figures in order to augment supplies
to the railways. Its Mr. Berry divulged
the “information” that there was a
“mountain” of coal piled up at Cobar
for the B.H.P.
The enginemen’s proposal brought
forth replies from three sources. A
B.H.P. spokesman said that if Mr. Berry
could find the “mountain” he had men-
tioned he was welcome to it. Coal Com-
missioner Williams said that it was impos-
sible to divert coal from 8.H.P., which,
because of reduced supplies and reduced
reserves, was now using less coal than
in 1944. A meeting of B.H.P. employees
carried a resolution characterising the
suggestion as “stupid” and a “wilful,
wicked distortion of facts,” stating that
only 10 days’ supply was on hand, and
calling upon “all sane unionists and
officials who appreciate fair play to send
telegrams and letters of appreciation to
the Coal Commissioner on his justifiable
action in refusing to divert coal.”
, There was a fourth comment on
the selfish and impudent suggestion. It
came from the Prime Minister, who at
the time was in Westralia congratulating
the Westralian coalminers on their fine
record, and expressing his regret that
N.S.W. coalminers didn’t take a leaf out
of their book. Replying to the engine-
men he didn’t mention the Collie miners,
but promised to discuss the matter with
the Minister of Supply.
A day or so later, after hearing from
the Communist Thornton “certain in-
formation about B.H.P. coal supplies”
which he “hesitated to give to the Press,”
the Sydney Labor Council agreed to sup-
port the enginemen’s cheeky demands.
This brought a statement from the Coal
Commissioner, who did not hesitate to
give it to the Press. Mr, Williams re-
vealed that weekly deliveries to the
B.H.P. were in fact 2400 tons below 1944
figures and the N.S.W. railways were re-
ceiving only 500 tons a week less than
in 1944.
A Mr. Platt of the N.S.W. Land
Transport Workers’ Union is another who
is belatedly worried at the coal position.
He is reported as saying that he
agreed that the miners should not over-
produce and permit private industries to
build up huge reserves of coal. That would
place them in the disastrous position in
which they found themselves in the lock-
out [!] of 1929.
At the same time Mr. Platt seemed to be
concerned at the effect of the lack of coal
supplies. At the effect on Australia?
No, at “Labor’s election prospects,
which are being prejudiced by the con-
tinuous shortage.
This led Mr. Ross, a Miners’ Federa-
tion journalist, to remark that it was no
policy of his Federation to keep stocks
down. That was “just another slander of
the capitalist Press.”
The policy of the Miners’ Federation as
a Federation is of little, interest; at the
moment its policy as part of a broader
scheme for usurpation of power by the
Communist party is of major importance.
Through its control of the coalfields Com-
munism is in a position to paralyse the
whole field of Australian industry, and it
has now come within an ace of doing so.
Communism is a creed that flourishes on
chaos and feeds on misery. ‘ Labor,
with its sordid materialism and its pur-
blind selfishness, has sacrificed everything
to the exigencies of holding on to votes
and clinging to office. Realising belatedly
that the Communist alliance, lacking tne
propaganda boost of Red Army victories,
may at this election be a vote-loser instead
of a vote-catcher, “Labor” has gone
through the motions of casting the Com-
munists off its back. The has
already, worn so thin that it deceives ou .
imbeciles.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Paradise for Criminals.
Under “Labor” rule Sydney has become
a happy hunting ground for not only
indigenous criminals addicted to violence
in all its forms, but for their counterparts
in other cities. There has recently been
an influx of ruffians from Melbourne, not
in every case to the liking of Harbor-
side practitioners of the arts of murder
and garrotting, and that of “stand-over
men” and the like. This was indicated
when the body of a Melbourne criminal,
in such a state that he must have been
done to death weeks before, was found
on a vacant allotment near the Trades
Hall. During a comparatively brief
sojourn in Sydney, he had “served” three
(3) months for shoplifting.
Reasons for the presence of crime in
Sydney, and for the attractions Sydney
offers to immigrants of the criminal class,
may be summarised in brief:
The police force is undermanned and dis-
organised. A great part of the population
rarely sees a constable. Nor is the under-
manned force confined to police work. One of
the multifarious duties assigned to policemen
has been the selling of “art-union” ( i.e lottery)
tickets under orders from the department.
When crimes occur the risk of detection is
much smaller than in cities with efficient police
forces. There is a long list of murders, rapes,
bashings and so forth the perpetrators of which
are still at large. And from .one cause and
another the proportion of convictions to prose-
cutions is startlingly small.
Almost any arrested man, whatever the
charge or whatever his antecedents, seems to
be able to get bail; and the police say many
of the crimes brought to their notice are
committed by men out on bail, “sureties” being
as easy to find as leaves in Vallombrosa.
As suggested by the bumping-off of the
Melbourne criminal who got three months
for shoplifting, and whose murderer or mur-
derers have not been traced, sentences are
almost invariably light and “remissions” are
on a lavish scale. Thus imprisonment is no
deterrent, especially as prisoners are furnished
with mod. cons., including s.-p. bookmakers and
secret wireless sets. And having completed his
short period of detention the emerging criminal
finds blackmarkets still flourishing—much more
so apparently than in other cities —and things
like baccarat schools awaiting his attention.
Illegal possession of firearms is reckoned a
venial offence; a fining matter. Eighteen
months ago Mr. Badly introduced a bill pro-
viding a penalty “not exceeding £5O” for pos-
session or discharge of “any machine-gun or
sub-machine-gun.” Under pressure Mr. Badly
agreed to fix the maximum penalty at £lOO or
“imprisonment for a period not exceeding six
months.”
The sovereign remedy for garrotting is flog-
ging. This has been proved at various periods
in the history of crime in England and in
N. S. Wales itself, but “Labor” has abolished
the lash and done away with hanging. It won’t
even hang murderers of policemen. Unarmed
policemen have to tackle armed and ferocious
criminals knowing that if they fall their mur-
derers will not mount the scaffold. It speaks
volumes for the courage of the undermanned
force that brave policemen have accepted the
unequal chance again and again. Two have
fallen to “wanted” men’s revolvers in a few
months, and several others have narrowly
escaped their fate.
In the second case of a policeman done
To death by an armed criminal, it came
out that N.S.W. law does not admit of
the disarming of men wanted on a num-
ber of charges, even if they venture with-
in prison gates. The men .in question
had been traced to a jail, where they had
gone visiting two girls under remand.
In fine, the cards are stacked and the
dice are loaded in favor of the criminal
class in its contest with the N.S.W. police
and public. Evidently, this will be the
case until the State gets rid of “Labor”
and its bogus humanitarianism and gets a
new criminal code and a new Com-
missioner. They seem to have an excel-
lent Commissioner in Victoria in the
person of a dour Scot who came from
Scotland Yard. Perhaps the Victorian
Government will be willing to lend him
to the next N.S.W. Government for a
twelvemonth.
Canada Beats Us Again.
Australian wheatgrowers, especially
those who had to deliver 1945 wheat, in
which, if things go wrong, they will have
no equity in the proceeds of sales above
the guaranteed price of ss. 2d. at ports —
and many of them will have little or no
1946 wheat —would have liked to be fully
informed by Mr. Scully of the four-year
wheat agreement between Britain and
Canada. Mr. Scully had other fish to
fry.
Particulars of the agreement appear in
the London “Times” of July 26, having
been given in the House of Commons on
the previous day by Mr. Strachey, the
Food Minister. Not preceded by the
expropriation of and payment at half the
world price for 1945 wheat, it provides
for British purchases from Canada of
160,000,000 bushels in 1946-47, the same
in 1947-48, and 140,000,000 bushels in
each of the two ensuing years, with pro-
vision for larger quantities in the first
two years “in the event of good harvests.”
Part of the deliveries are to be made in
the form of flour—soo,ooo tons in
1946-47, 400,000 tons in 1947-48 (with
up to another 140,000 tons in each year,
dependent on the crop”) and a minimum
of 300,000 tons in 1948-49 and 1949-50.
The “Times” notes that the minimum
quantities will amount to “twice the total
Canadian wheat and flour exports to this
country before 1939.”
“The price specified in the contract in
the first year,” Mr. Strachey said, “is 30
per cent, below the current United States
price and still more below the open-
market price in Argentina.” Prices and
Australian equivalents are subjoined:
1946- (fixed) .. .. $l-55 (9s. 6id.A.)
1947- (fixed) .. .. $l-55 (9s. 6^d.A.)
1948- (minimum) .. $1.25 (7s. Bd.A.)
1949- (minimum) .. $l-00 (6s. 2d.A.)
Actual prices for 1948-49 and 1949-50
wheat are to be negotiated by December
31, 1947, and 1948, respectively.
An Opposition member asked: “Is a
similar agreement to be negotiated with
Australia, our other big provider of
cereals?” The Minister replied: We
have not been approached by the Aus-
tralian Government at the moment for
any such agreement.”
Perhaps Mr. Scully was, and is, too
busy working out the details of his agree-
ment with the New Zealand Govern-
ment, which in 1938 imported a million
pounds’ worth of Australian wheat and
wheat products, and in whose country
wheat production has been steadily de-
clining. The arrangement as set forth by
Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Scully’s fellow-negoti-
ator, is that “Australia will supply our
Dominion’s requirements for the next
four or five years at ss. 9d. a bushel.
That is to be the ceiling price, and if
EASTWARD HO!
“The outstanding feature of Mr. Chifley’s week’s tour in and around Perth and the one
country visit to Busselton and Bunbury was, in the opinion of those who accompanied me
Prime Minister, the apathy of the electorate.” — “S. M. Herald's” Canberra correspondent
who was one of “those.”
there is any fall in world parity or any
factor justifying a reduction in the next
four or five years. New Zealand will get
the benefit.”
From an Old Politician.
C. L. A. Abbott, M.H.R. for Gwydir
(1925-29 and 1931-37) and Administra-
tor of the Northern Territory (1937-45),
surveys the situation and outlook:
“Labor” is starting out on this election with
little reference to its own record. Mr. Chifley,
with pipe, will state that he is following in the
footsteps of John Curtin, and if this does not
seem enough he will ask his auditors whether
they wish to return to the “muddle of Men-
zies.” The “Labor” Government has been in
office for five years, and it is so bereft of
ideas and accomplishments that it will rely upon
the dead hand of a past Prime Minister and
upon asking the electors to “look what those
coves did before we came in.”
When the Curtin Government took office
in 1941 the war was two years old. The Gov-
ernments of Menzies and Fadden had formed the
Second A.I.F. and sent it to the Middle
East; the Australian Navy had been expanded
and Collins of the Sydney and Waller of the
Stuart had won fame for Australia by their
work in the Mediterranean, and the R.A.A.F.
had become a definite fighting force, largely
through the efforts of James Fairbaim, who was
fated not to rejoice at the triumphant results
of the Empire Air Training Scheme, of which
he was one of the originators. On the home
front price-control had been established, and
munitions factories were in production under
the leadership of Menzies-appointed men. The
purchase of the wool clips had been arranged
with Britain, and no form of primary produc-
tion had been left without assured returns.
In short, “Labor” was handed a going
machine; and this is what “Labor” did with it.
In the Army, through Ministerial weakness,
dissension was bred between the commanders
and the rank and file. The discipline of the
A.1.F., which had then returned, was impaired.
Officers were warned ndt to be strict. Men
were told they could Always appeal to the
Minister, and, indeed, to tie “Labor” party. Even
now, a year after Japan has ceased to fight,
there are 100,000 men in uniform in Australia,
bored to the point of desperation. The “Gov-
ernment” will not give them their discharges
and so allow them to become productive
members of the community. The Australian
force in Japan is without reasonable amenities,
and recruiting has dwindled to a trickle. The
generals have gone without recognition or
thanks.
In the R.A.A.F. the position became impos-
sible. The “Labor” Government would not
appoint a sole commander who would keep
the force welded together. It had both an
operational command and an administrative
command, and the articles written by Air-
Marshal Bostock are sufficient to show what
happened.
The Navy was more fortunate. It was under
the Admiralty, and escaped the dissensions
sown by the “Government.”
In the return from war to peace the ‘ Gov-
ernment” has shown its incapacity. It is unable
or is afraid to shut down the big war-time de-
partments. One in every four of the adult
population is employed by the Government,
non-productively. Sky-high taxes remain and
are preventing industry from stabilising and
expanding. Unlike the Fraser Government,
the Chifley Government is going to the country
without having brought down a Budget; accord-
ing to Mr. Fadden and other taxation experts,
it dare not because of unissued assessments
and uncollected taxes equivalent to the entire
revenue of the Commonwealth before the war.
It is also holding many millions earned by the
production of wheat-farmers, woolgrowers and
other producers. It has an all-time record for
trips and jaunts. It admits an expenditure ot
£89,000 on this head, perhaps half of what has
actually been expended since 1942.
In its spineless handling of coal the Gov-
ernment has brought the country to its knees.
On all sides industries are slowing down and
closing. It has been weak, vacillating and with-
out objective. Whilst the nation is moving
towards chaos the Prime Minister can only talk
sob stuff about the conditions of the miners
and the rapacity of the owners. He will not
consider the Davidson coal report, and once
more his followers scream that “the Judge is
crook.” To industrial arbitration only lip-
service is given. The Federal public service is
disorganised, and high officers continue to re-
sign. Everywhere is the ominous rumble ot
impending trouble.
The “Government’s” attitude towards Com-
munism is indefinable. Mr. Healy, from Man-
chester, still reigns on the waterfront and over
the foreign policy of the Commonwealth, Mr.
Thornton over the Ironworkers and Mr. Wells
over the coalminers. All these men are Com-
munists. Mr. Wells went to Brisbane with
£5OOO to try to bolster up the dying meat strike
but was howled down. Even that did not make
the Government’s attitude any stronger.
The domination of the Left in the Labor
party is such as no pre-war Labor leader would
have endured. Despite this Mr. Chifley has said
that he will “never crucify the workers” or
split the party. He “leads” both from behind,
“so marvellous his nerve is.” This may have
suited Spain; surely it will not be tolerated
by Australia.
Full Circle.
Because miners won’t work and because
neither the Federal nor the State “Labor”
Government will do anything about it,
though there are heaps of things they
could do, there isn’t sufficient coal to
run the N.S.W. Government trains.
Glad of an opportunity to divert atten-
tion from its failure to deal with the coal
conspirators, the Sydney “Government”
began shouting about a “transport crisis”
last week and called a conference between
its Transport Minister, a Mr. O’Sullivan,
the Railways and Road Transport De-
partments, the State A.L.P., the Sydney
Labor Council and the transport unions.
The result was a proposal to set up a
“special authority to co-ordinate rail and
road transport,” commandeer 1000 motor
trucks and use them to carry “essential
goods.”
If Premier McKell has any sense of
humor at all, he must smile wryly at it.
He was a member of the Lang Govern-
ment which 16 years ago introduced the
transport-strangulation policy, in the first
place by passing an act “to provide a
greater measure of control over privately-
owned motor services with the object £f
eliminating wasteful duplication.” There
is poetic justice in its having bounced
right back at him. The measure was de-
signed for nothing else than to kill com-
mercial road transport apd force the pub-
lic to use the Government railways. Its
operation was marked by an amount of
bureaucratic espionage and tyranny in-
conceivable before that time.
Now, with the railways short of trucks
as well as coal, the wheel of transport
strangulation has turned full circle and
stood “Labor” on its wooden head.
Hauliers are even to have some of their
tax-money returned to them in the form
of subsidies.
The Murray Valley.
A great many of those enthusiasts who
take up a cause that is fashionable at the
moment have adopted the Murray Valley
development plan, and are waving their
arms and shouting that it ought to
be a sort of Austral Tennessee Valley
scheme. They’ve read or heard of T.V.A.
and seen motion pictures illustrating its
wonders and, like all who are charmed
by the vision of achievement into forget-
ting what must be done to achieve it,
they seem to believe that Canberra or
Sydney or Cohuna has but to give the
word and the thing is done.
To what extent members of the
Murray Valley Development League are
misled by this is doubtful. At any rate
the League’s secretary, G. V. Lawrence,
has seen fit to close down the dampers:
While inspiration can be drawn from the
way in which T.V.A. has brought Federal,
State and local agencies and citizens into co-
operation for the development of that
valley, we do not at this stqge look for —
and we hope we won’t have to look for —
a Murray Valley Authority which will itself
carry out works and incur expenditure on
the grand scale. What we do want is an
authority which, after due inquiry, may be
able to insist upon development carried out
harmoniously by existing State instrumen-
talities. A Murray Valley authority on
T.V.A. lines may be necessary if inter-
state and inter-departmental jealousies and
departmental vested interests tend to clutter
up the plan.
The Tennessee and Murray are totally
different streams. The Tennessee has its
headwaters in the States of Virginia,
North Carolina and Georgia, It flows
thence through Tennessee, into Alabama
and the fringe of Mississippi, then north
through Tennessee again into the Ohio in
Kentucky, draining most of Tennessee
and parts of six other States. It is about
900 miles long, and before it reaches the
Ohio is a mile wide. The Tennessee
Valley covers an area of about 42,000
square miles with a population of
2.500.000 (T.V.A. was backed by the
financial, material and labor resources
of 130,000,000 people), engaged in farm-
ing, mining, timber-getting, manufactur-
ing, etc. The area comprises heavy
forests, lakes, streams, mountains and
lowlands. One of the earliest-settled
parts of the U.S.A., it became subject to
erosion and catastrophic floods.
Except for its length, erosion and- —to
a small degree—floods, the Murray is in
no way comparable. After it leaves
Albury and the Hume Dam, the river
flows sluggishly through a level land
whose only heights are low sandhills to
the sea, fed for its first third of length by
a few short streams from Victoria, and
for the rest by the equally sluggish and
chancy Murrumbidgee and Darling
Rivers. The Murray Valley area may be
25.000 square miles, but much of it is in
the 10-12 inch rainfall belt, whereas the
Tennessee flows through high-rainfall
areas all its length. The Murray Valley
population is probably around 100,000
people, from Jingellic to the sea, taking
in everybody within cooee.
All the same, with vision and hard
work, the Murray Valley could provide
2,000,000 people with a good living. Its
climate and its opportunities are both
superior to those of the T.V., and whereas
the T.V. has about all the people it wants
the M.V. is crying aloud for people. It
is undoubtedly the greatest potential
source of wealth and settlement in south-
east Australia, and it needs but vision
and courage to bring it to life. Neither
can be expected from the two cities which,
though hundreds of miles away and
farther off still in sentiment and outlook,
control its destinies. The driving force
must come from the valley itself, must
be strong enough to overcome “inter-
departmental jealousies and departmental
vested interests,” and blast its way
through indifference and ignorance. Its
chance would lie in the formation
of a new State.
One Thing Wanting.
Profiting by the disaster of 1939, the
Victorian Forests Commission, to counter
the menace of bushfires, has constructed
4500 miles of motor transport roads into
vulnerable areas, established 120 two-way
radio-communication units, with 17
officers in direct touch with headquarters,
built numerous fire towers, acquired 43
trailer pumps and 140 portable pumps
with 140,000 feet of hose, and collected
a staff of trained men, with eight
R.A.A.F. aircraft to assist them. The
American system has been largely fol-
lowed and it won’t be the commission’s
fault if its measures aren’t successful.
But there is still no single control for
organising the various departments,
which all have differing policies with
regard to grazing on forest areas, burning-
off and other fundamental matters. The
equipment wasn’t tested last season or the
season before it. Certainly, the condi-
tions which produced the 1939 blaze were
under the control of a single authority—
the sky god.

The flocking of European Jews to
Palestine has been checked by the diver-
sion of shiploads to Cyprus. The illicit
immigrants are nearly all coming from
Moscow's satellite countries, that being
part of Moscow’s campaign against
Britain, another feature of which has
been the appearance of Russian agents
breathing hatred of Britain in the British
zone of Germany ; they are disguised as
U.N.R.R.A. men. The U.S.A., as well as
Britain, has been struck at by way of a
Russian ultimatum to Turkey demand-
ing Russian fortifications in the Dardan-
elles, and —obviously in obedience to
Moscow orders Tito Communists,
while still cadging hard from U.N.R.R.A.,
to which the U.S.A. is the prin-
cipal contributor, have shot down a
Dakota ’plane stormbound over Yugo-
slavia. To show that its patience bas
its limits, America has sent a serviceable
squadron into the Mediterranean. Mos-
cow is bluffing, but it doesn’t seem to
realise that its bluff has been called.
If the electors declare for another
Menzies Ministry it will, in the aggregate,
be at least 150 years younger than the
present mob. Ages of certainties and
probabilities (of course there are others,
like Tommy White), with those of their
opposite numbers in brackets:
Menzies 52 (Chifley 61), Fadden 51
(Lazzarini 59), Archie Cameron 51 (Makin
57—position unfilled), Holt 38 (Holloway
70 or thereabouts), McLeay 54 (Don Cam-
eron 68), Cooper 55 (Collings 81), Har-
rison 54 (Ashley at least 68), McEwen 46
(Drakeford 60 or so). Spender 49 (Forde
56), A. N. McDonald 58 (Scully 61), An-
thony 49 (Johnson in the sixties), Dame
Enid Lyons 49 (Frost 60), Abbott 55
(Fraser 59).
For other positions there are Hutchin-
son (42), ex-Senator Keith Wilson, who
looks a fair thing for Boothby (46), and
the new men Turnbull (43) and Gullett.
The youngest member of the Chifley
crowd is old enough to have sired a son
of Gullett’s age.
Sydney and Melbourne are to be
treated on successive nights to the finest
display of double-handed mud-slinging
ever presented to the Australian public.
The show will open in the East Sydney
electorate tonight when Ward, who drew
the Brisbane Line, will be supported by
Calwell, who draws the line at nothing.
On Thursday there will be a repeat per-
formance in Calwell’s electorate. Reports
that municipal authorities in the two
cities are putting on additional garbage
collectors after the meetings are without
foundation—both councils are responsible
for the collection of clean refuse only.
Moscow and Moscow-satellite diplo-
mats have been amusing themselves at
Dr. Evatt’s expense. Vyshinsky objected
to his appointment as chairman of the
Paris Conference Secretariat, saying that
Australia (j.e., Evatt) had shown itself a
“rather temperamental member” and that
“perhaps it would be better to have the
representative of a calmer nation” —
Abyssinia! Then came Masaryk, from
Czechoslovakia:
What do you, with your kangaroo-filled
open spaces, know of the problems of
Europe, where every time you spit you hit
the next man’s boots? If I really wanted a
holiday from serious problems I should like
to become Foreign Minister of Australia.
The doctor was so flustered that he pro-
tested his undying admiration for Soviet
Russia —which was bad electioneering.
N. S. Wales has a Minister of Local
Government, a Mr. Cahill, and Mr. Cahill
has decided that he is to be Local Gov-
ernment, at least until he is sent about his
business. Mr. Cahill has ordered an
amalgamation of municipalities, the lead-
ing feature of which seems to be that
improvident, high-rated “Labor” districts
are to absorb and control solvent and
low-rated Liberal districts, and is himself
to nominate a raft of “provisional coun-
cils.” If Mr. Cahill’s Cabinet were restric-
ted by law to the running of peanut stalls
it couldn’t help making a mess of things ;
and its municipal mess may be the worst
of all.
Dedman has been heard in N. S. Wales
speaking for “Labor” no-hopers. He
would be well advised to concentrate on
his own seat, which is shaky. Even at
the landslide election his majority was
only 2721. There were 59,343 electors
then ; there will be 66,000 next month,
and among the electors new and old
there are men who know all about what
happened in New Britain, Amboina, Java
and Timor, and the horror camps, and on
the Burma-Siam railway, and women
whose nerves have been worn to shreds
in the search for houses and consumer
goods, promised so effusively by the
Dedman crowd.
The strength of the N.S.W. Assembly
has been reduced from 90 to 86 by resig-
nations of Federal candidates: ex-
Premiers Lang (Auburn) and Mair
(Albury); Richardson (Ashfield) and
Lethbridge (Corowa). Lang was Fatner
of the House, though his term has not
been continuous ; first elected on Decem-
ber 6, 1913, he was out for a few weeks
in 1943, as a result of his unsuccessful
shot at Reid. He may do better this
time. Mair dates from June 11, 1932.
He looks like going into the Senate, with
Richardson keeping him company as
M.H.R. for Parkes.
Fraser, the Maoriland P.M., had the
nous to appoint Major Skinner, a re-
turned soldier of the recent war, as Minis-
ter of Rehabilitation, with the special
duty of providing for soldier-settlers.
Addressing ex-servicemen at Wellington,
Skinner said that “more than 2000 men
have been settled on farms, leaving 5600
to be attended to,” and that as for housing
“16,000 ex-servicemen have been accom-
modated ; more than 50 per cent, who
have applied for housing.” In N. S.
Wales, which has upwards of a million
more people, “Labor” does not dare to
publish its farm and housing figures.
Tully, who has no record of war service,
said something vague about a few score
soldier-settlers having been “placed”
before packing his ports for the London
office, meanwhile paying a few pounds
into the Assemblymen’s pension fund by
way of qualifying for £6 a week for life
when he has used up London, or London
has used up him.
The sober and impartial “Christian
Science Monitor” notes that “the high
degree of friendship which tied the
Netherlands East Indies to Australia is at
an end”:—
Sharp differences between- the Govern-
ments led the Dutch to move from Aus-
tralia. The refusal of Australian wharf-
laborers to load Dutch ships brought the
differences to a head, and the crisis reached
a climax when the Dutch cancelled orders
for Australian goods. The Dutch have
indicated that orders will in future go to
the United States, and that huge supplies
bought and stored in Australia will be
sold, as there is no chance of shipping
them to the Indies.
And it is all a result of the wonderful
Evatt letting Communists take charge of
his foreign policy.
Thus early in the election campaign
“Labor” speakers have failed to stir any
sign of enthusiasm, even in supposed
strongholds. Calwell had two bad meet-
ings in North Queensland. For Chifley
there were attentive audiences in Wes-
tralia (nobody would think of chipping
at the P.M., who has a natural courtesy),
but when the uncouth Mountjoy fol-
lowed him in an address at the Govern-
ment railway workshops, the Mountjoy
flow of flapdoodle brought a roar of
derision. The foolish fellow said he
sympathised with “those of you who are
losing ss. and 10s. a week from your
pay envelopes.” “Twenty-five bob you
mean,” a workshops man interjected, and
“another broke through the laughter with
a shout of ‘What about your own two
hundred that isn’t touched?’” Even men
who normally vote “Labor” have no use
for the kind of ass (in Mountjoy’s case,
a Moscow-doped ass) who in three
years hasn’t taken the trouble to ascer-
tain what “Labor’s” taxes extract from
those on fixed pay.
Like similar motoring bodies in other
States, the R.A.A. of S.A., having heard
Chifley’s so-called reasons for continuing
petrol rationing— at an administrative
cost of £20,000 a month —refuses to be-
lieve that it is necessary. The private
motorist is now rationed to 240 miles a
month, and that is more than he could
afford to do if allowed to buy as much
petrol as he liked.
Senator O’Flaherty, from S.A., chose a
bad time to advocate the raising of
Parliamentary salaries to £l5OO a year.
N. S. Wales, which has 21 “Labor”
Ms.H.R., is still reeling from the shock
of the pensions-for-Assemblymen ramp.
Australia has been listening to broad-
casts from Canberra and asking itself
how most of the “Labor” members ever
got the job. The Canberra Government
is running huge advertisements urging
everybody to save; the whole country
is in revolt against huge Governmental
expenditure and excessive taxation, and
there are Commonwealth elections next
month. His colleagues in both Houses
must long for the power to strike
O’Flaherty temporarily dumb.
The Queensland Communist Paterson
blew into Sydney last week to open the
Communists’ election campaign—he is
the only member they have in the seven
Parliaments and he won’t last much
longer—and put up the usual blither
about “the millionaires of Australia”:
Our opponents hate us because they know
we mean it when we say that if we have
our way the millionaires will cease to exist
, unless they go to work like honest work-
ing men.
It’s a persistent delusion of these Commos
that wealthy Australians —if there are any
left, outside the booze, betting and black-
marketing interests —spend their days in
idleness. Paterson, Miles, Sharkey and
the rest would howl to Heaven if they
were asked to do half the work and share
a tenth of the worry and responsibility
of, say, a pastoralist in a drought-stricken
region.
A witness before the Tariff Board,
opposing additional duties on imported
optical goods, said that “half of Aus-
tralia’s population now wears spectacles.”
And too many of them are rose-colored.
There is a Commonwealth Government.
It has, and rightly, ample power to deal
with people who break industrial laws
and cause loss, confusion and hardship.
There are coalmines —some State-owned ;
others under Commonwealth control —
and people employed to mine coal. They
never tire of breaking the industrial laws
in the process of causing loss, confusion
and hardship. Does the Commonwealth
Government propose to uphold its laws
and its right to govern? It does not. It
proposes to spend the taxpayers’ money
in subsidising road transport to carry
goods which the N.S.W. Government’s
railways can’t carry because they haven’t
sufficient coal. This is the “Government”
which expects the Australian people to re-
elect it on September 28.
Hugh Roberton, the Digger farmer
who is standing for the Country party
against Langtry in Riverina, felt pretty
confident of winning until a couple of
weeks ago. Now, since Federal “Labor”
has passed the Scully bill expropriating
1945 wheat at half the world price, and
grabbed £7,000,000 to £10,000,000 of war-
time wool profits, all with Langtry's
approval, Roberton looks as much a cer-
tainty as Bernborough would look if
weighted at 9.5 for the Narrandera
Picnic Cup.
Evatt’s latest brain-child —doomed in-
evitably to be still-born —is a Court of
Human Rights to which States, indi-
viduals or groups could appeal from the
decisions of national courts, or in special
cases by direct approach. What would
be the Doc.’s reaction if a group of
harassed Australian housewives, fed up
with train-cuts, power-restrictions and
other troubles inseparable from “Labor’s”
surrender to larrikinism in the mines,
were to approach the Court for relief?
Barry, the Health Minister, thinks he
has overcome the maternity-bed crisis in
Melbourne by an exchange of patients be-
tween the Queen Victoria Hospital and
the old Public Hospital in Swanston-
street. This is estimated to provide an
extra 250 maternity beds within a week,
sufficient to serve the community for the
next 25 years. Eventually the old Public
Hospital will be called the Queen Vic-
toria and a wing added. Still, it is only
an emergency measure. A short while
ago the Central Hospital was described
as effete, old-fashioned, inefficient and
due for demolition and the site was sug-
gested for a park.
Now that Melbourne University has
decentralised culture by establishing a
branch at Mildura, some 500 students
will journey to the dried-fruitopolis to
acquire wisdom. Premier Cain has re-
commended the “loading” of professors'
salaries to meet the increased cost of
living, but there is no mention of a
similar concession with regard to under-
graduates, most of whom will be ex-
servicemen and -women. Undergrads
paid for their fees in Melbourne by go-
ing to Mildura for the fruit-picking
season.
A Melbourne “Herald” gentleman
records that “when the Russians came
to Vienna, their first serious business was,
as usual, to collect all the wrist watches,”
the “collection” being preceded by use of
the word “oora,” meaning “watch.”
Then “a film of the Potsdam conference
was shown in a theatre crowded with
Russian, British, American and French
troops and Viennese civilians”:
Suddenly across the screen strode Stalin.
He walked up to greet Churchill with his
hand outstretched in a gesture only too
familiar to the Viennese. A voice from
the darkness shouted “Oora.” The audi-
ence dissolved in laughter. The Russians
stopped the show.
Then came the anticlimax, “I am a
warm admirer of the Russians; the tre-
mendous jerk with which they have taken
themselves out of feudalism has been
magnificent almost beyond comprehen-
sion.” All bunk, of course, and if “the
tremendous jerk” hasn’t made the Russkis
honest, what is jjs moral worth?
A party of Soviet ladies, ostensibly on
their way to Mrs. Jessie Street’s Chatter-
Chatter Conference in Sydney, and per-
haps contemplating a spot of election-
eering, left their run a bit late and learned
in London, from Norman Mighell, that
some Australians had better priorities
than theirs. Naturally regarding this
“cooler” as a plot against the Soviet
Union and its magnificent efforts to bring
enlightenment and freedom to the dark
places wherein the Jessie Street torch
flickers somewhat feebly, they asked that
lady, by cable, for assistance, “otherwise
we’ll have to return to the Soviet Union.”
Mrs, Street, having seen the Soviet Union
herself and probably horrified at the pros-
pect of anyone having to return, set to
work immediately. In no time she’d
located our wandering Minister Evatt,
got his assurance of assistance, “in-
formed” Chifley and Ward of “the
facts” and induced the other Evatt,
Sydney Minister for No-Immigration and
No-Tourists, to “contact” Beasley. It’s
all very strange seeing that Mrs. Street is
the A.L.P. candidate for Wentworth, and
that the A.L.P. has gone through the
motions of “banning” all Communist
affiliations and declaring a paper war on
anything with a Communist tinge to it.


ANOTHER LOADED DOG.
“‘Labor’ candidates have received instructions to avoid mentioning the sky-high taxes.”

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Jasby”: I used to think it was just
an old myth to be dragged out as a laugh-
raiser at election-time, but it does happen.
After months of house-hunting luck
broke my way and I was able to gather
my scattered family under one roof once
more. Last night when I got home my
wife was glowing with maternal pride.
During the afternoon as she walked down
the street with our youngest in her arms
an elderly gentleman had stopped her,
patted the baby on the head and had be-
come almost lyrical about the good looks
and healthy appearance of the child.
“While he was speaking,” she said, “Mrs.
So-and-So came along and introduced us.
It was Mr. Borderline —such a nice old
chap.” I spluttered. Borderline is our
local member, and I don’t agree with his
politics. Now I’m going to have my work
cut out persuading her not to vote for
him.
“Bo”: Hearing a radio pundit scorn-
fully dismiss a subject as being “about
as uninspiring as a door-knocker” set me
thinking. Just 140 • years ago Beeth-
oven composed what is now generally
regarded as the greatest violin concerto
ever written. The orchestral introduc-
tion opens with four drum-beats —some-
one had knocked on Ludwig’s door as
he was casting about for a start, and the
staccato demand for admittance gave
him the idea for the tympani subject.
Again, in his Fifth Symphony the humble
bit of builders’ hardware supplied the
composer with the inspiration for
the famous opening movement —the three
short notes followed by a long one, prac-
tically the same sound as the Morse code
V, which was to become the Victory
symbol of Europe under the Nazi occu-
pation. That opening theme of the
Fifth is the most remarkable example in
music of economic use of four notes —
Beethoven built from them, in double
bars, harmony of great power and
beauty. He himself described it as
“Thus Fate Knocks at the Door.”
And it is significant that nine out of ten
people knocking on a door do knock
four times.

“Eve”; The over-dressed woman got
off the tram, positive she had left a great
impression behind her. One man in the
back seat said to his mate: “Some style,
eh?” But the other had his own way of
working problems out. He said, “No,
she’s a fraud. If she was as classy as she
looks she’d be in a taxi at least, if not a
car. Those furs and diamonds are noth-
ing but cat-skins and glass.”

“Clooter”: One of those problems that
face the parents of the adolescent cropped
up in our locality, a colt rising 17 being
the cause. His elder brother suddenly
noticed .that the lad’s left ear looked as
though its convolutions and orifice had
been sprayed with black lead or some-
thing and made sarcastic references to the
value of soap and water. The colt turned
a deep red, appeared about to choke
and fled to his own room, where he barri-
caded himself in and refused blandish-
ments, tucker and threats. Next day,
though ordinarily a clean youth, he
appeared with the lug still in dark con-
trast to the rest of him, whereupon his
male parent somewhat violently de-
manded an explanation. The colt took
himself and his dirty left ear from the
home at a rush, didn’t come home that
night and was presently located at the
home of an aunt. His mother, now cer-
tain that he was a fit subject for psychi-
atric attention, took the matter in hand.
Between them the two ladies got the ex-
planation. He had entertained for some
months a violent if suppressed emotion
for a pretty typiste some 10 years his
senior. She had playfully planted a kiss
on his left ear in return for some slight
service and he wanted to keep the member
in the condition she had left it. Some
weeks have passed since then, but the
ear remains unwashed, and a flapper
friend of the family, persuaded to attempt
an antidote in the form of a kiss on the
same spot, just missed having her face
pushed in.

“Pawang”: The cables report that
the approaching hayfever season is giving
the United States Post Office a peculiar
headache. A country barber is fighting
the department for the right to send out
his own little cure for the disease —“When
you sneeze, sneeze with your mouth
open”—collecting one dollar from every
recipient of his nostrum, which the de-
partment claims is an attempt to defraud
the public. A city health officer told
me years ago that the cure for a cold was
not to blow your nose with your mouth
shut —in fact, not to blow at all. He
averred that the average person, by
closing his mouth and blowing his nose,
distributed the germs of a cold through-
out his system. The worst sufferers from
colds I know are always the heartiest
blowers, and one of them makes the
atomic bomb explosion at Bikini seem
like a harmless cracker. The barber may
be another unappreciated genius.
* * $ «
“Norther”: When I got into Brisbane
show last week I wasn’t astonished to see
"All right —GO back to your mother, and give her my love!”
the usual display of proud bulls and
pumpkins, the harried father with five
kids looking for his lost missus -or the
benevolent Clydesdale in his stall. These
things and more are part of the Queens-
land landscape and therefore to be
accepted. Nor was Perry Brothers’ circus
.abnormal, except that it had nearly been
shot to death when it crossed the path
of the intrepid hunters of the Yengarie
lion a week or so earlier, for it seems
to me the Perry show has always been
with us in war and peace. But what
about “Jumbo, the Giant Life-saving St.
Bernard from the Swiss Alps, whose ex-
pression betokens Dignity, Obedience,
Benevolence and Wisdom”? And “King
Kom, the Giant Bullock,” “Sandy, Aus-
tralia’s Smallest Horse,” Marjorie Van*
Camp’s “Pig Circus” and —hold every-
thing—“ The Flea Circus”? Where have
they all been during these past years of
war, food and travel restrictions, man-
power call-ups and so forth? And who
fed the flamin’ fleas while they were be-
ing trained?
* * * *
“Don s’s” say on Freud;
My unit was on manoeuvres outside Towns-
ville when a couple of Nip seaplanes dropped
a few bombs —the only casualty was a palm-
tree. Only a few guards were in the camp,
including a tent-mate of mine. Next day I
asked him how he got on in the raid. “It was
pretty hot while it lasted,” he said. “They
circled the area and then machine-gunned it
from end to end. Thank God the mob was
away or there’d have been dozens of casualties.”
I looked at him in amazement, knowing that
there had been no machine-gunning and no
bombs had fallen within miles of our campsite.
Sensing my disbelief, he said “Go and look at
the bullet-marks on the trees.” I did so. There
were a few bullet-marks in the trees. I had
been reading Freud at the time and soon diag-
nosed his case. Behind his mild exterior was a
desire for adventure and danger; the excite-
ment of the alarm, followed by the anti-climax,
was too much for him. He had invented the
story and probably had fired the shots himself.
No doubt he now believed his own narrative. I
had it all sewn up. A few days later one of
the other guards told me the story. Just after
the alarm a couple of Yank five-tonners had
driven past the camp. Some of the crew must
have had a few in, and as they passed the
clump of timber they had a little practice with
their pistols. From the bottom of a slit trench
no doubt it sounded realistic enough. That
night Freud helped boil the billy.

“Cine Ma”; Last week I saw a film in
Melbourne of the daring feats performed
by movie “stunt” men who take the place
of film stars when some particularly
risky business has to be manipulated. At
about the same time a truck developed
steering trouble on a bridge at Dart-
moor (Vic.). It skidded along the curbing
of the bridge, taking four posts in its
journey, fell 20 feet to an embankment,
somersaulted on to the railway line and
landed right side up after turning com-
pletely over, driver and passenger then
emerging scatheless.

“Savant”; The Turnbull Library copy
of Moby Dick (B. 7/8/’46) is not the true
first edition of Melville’s work. Although
it is very highly regarded by American
collectors, the real bibliophile will require
the English edition, first published by
Bentley in three volumes in 1851 under
the title of The Whale. The American
edition was a plug, and although Harper’s
printed 500 copies they still ha 4 297
copies unsold when their warehouse was
destroyed by fire two years later. These,
together with many hundreds of copies
of Melville’s other works, were lost.
Hence the comparative rarity of many
of his books. Bentley paid Melville £l5O
for an edition of 1000 copies of The
Whale, most of which seem to have dis-
appeared. This book has sold as high as
£9OO. In the boom years round 1928,
when prices for rare books were sky-
rocketing overseas, a copy was offered
by a Sydney bookseller. Although the
catalogue stated that no copy of the book
had been sold at auction for 16 years,
the price asked was only ten guineas—
surely an all-time low for such a famous
volume. Melville’s scarcest work is Timo-
leon. A small book in paper covers, it
was printed in 1888 in an edition of 25
copies. A copy sold in London some
years ago for £2OO.

“Black Sheep”: So the railmen at Ips-
wich workshops (Q.) demand a special
train for rail workers to take them to
Sydney for Christmas. That reminds me.
During the ’26 drought I had a mob of
sheep at a N.Q. siding awaiting a train to
shift them. A train whistled. We sprang
to attention. The train shot past us, arms
waving and bottles thrown from windows.
With sheep dying on their feet we settled
back to wait, wondering what the hell
that train was. We found out: it was a
special for rail workers from Mt. Isa to
take them for a holiday to the seaside
at Townsville. The line had been cleared
and all traffic put back two hours so
those exhausted aristos should not be
delayed.

“Hamer”; The old-time barber’s shop
(“Morehead,” B. 7/8/’46) was a club-
room, too. The artist of the razor was
glad to lend his joint for meetings of the
cricket or football club committee;
rival tobacconists laid themselves out to
catch such affiliations, and notices of
sporting fixtures and results were posted
on the window. It had other uses
when Pat Sullivan, who went to U.S. and
made a fortune out of “Felix the Cat,”
the first of the animal comic strips, was
struggling with his cat in Sydney. Pat
drew caricatures of sporting personalities
and local identities for a small chain of
barbers’ shops; the barber sold them to
his customers and the result was mutually
satisfactory to barber and artist. But the
old idea of the barber’s shop as a social
centre has gone as completely as the
“toilet club,” once an adjunct of every
such establishment. You paid a bob a
week and the barber kept you shaved and
hair-trimmed ; if you were finicky you
could supply your own mug and shaving
brush.
* * * *
“Bozo”: Waiting your turn for a hair-
cut is not the dull affair it used to be—
the acts put on by hard-up smokers make
it as good as a variety show. An arid old
coot who breezed in and demanded a
packet of papers took the knock
back with very bad grace. “So this is the
country we fought for,” he roared,
“nothin’ but a lot of blasted racketeers.
I’ve had to crawl on me belly to get a
couple of ounces of weed and now I can’t
get a paper to smoke it with. I’ve ‘had’
this blistering country. There’s a Yank
boat leavin’ tomorrow and I’m going with
her. I’m clearing to blazes out of this
place.” There was a stunned silence as
he made a final gesture of contempt and
turned to walk out. The little bloke in
the corner was the first to recover. “Hey,
mate,” he called; “how about selling us
your tobacco?”

“Ichabod Crane”; A Sydney sports
columnist has been canvassing the possi-
bility of “tenniser” or “tennisist” ousting
“tennis-player” from our vocabulary on
the grounds that the hyphenated word is
clumsy and is not in line with usage in
other sports. One or other of the forms
may achieve popularity—“goin’ tennisin’ ”
has been a popular Sunday afternoon
pursuit up our way these many years-
but as a rule people are disinclined to
adopt new names for old pastimes. If
the innovation does take on and is ex-
tended to other games, it will be interest-
ing to hear arguments between* hockeyists
and lacrossers, bridgers and whistists and
draughtsists and chessers. While on the
subject I suggest that “columniator 1 '
would very often be an apter term than
“columnist.”
* * * *
“Spokeshave”: People can carry a
physical defect for years without even
noticing the difference between them and
others. An old lady of 70 called on a
Collins-street oculist and complained of
trouble in her left eye. Examination
showed that while the left eye had a
slight weakness the right eye was stone
blind. For over 40 years the patient
hadn’t used it, although she thought her
eyesight was perfectly normal.
*
“Seaforth”: As the tram approached
the ferry wharf the cove seated opposite
arose and hurled himself from the vehicle
as if chased by a pack of mad dogs.
Dashing across the wharf he made a run-
ning jump for a ferry before she berthed
and barely escaped being jammed between
the vessel and wharf. Following at a
leisurely pace I crossed the gangplank and
travelled to town with him in a half-empty
boat. As the ferry neared the wharf he
clambered through a window, climbed on
to the rail and made a dangerous leap
to the shore. I walked ashore and strolled
to my joffice, stopping to make a few
small purchases on the journey. Next
door to the office was the usual crowd
of employees waiting for their boss to
open up a rag shop. Glancing at a street
clock 1 noted that they had another five
minutes’ wait. Among them was my
fellow-passenger who had twice risked his
life earlier that morning.

“Pitt St.’s” story (B. 17/7/’46)

married taxpayer who boldly wrote in the

dants —“Watch this space.”

“Jeff”: Mob-fights, uncommon in war
years, are again the vogue amongst irre-
sponsible youths in Melbourne, but com-
pared with the doings of earlier gangs
these fights are mere skirmishes. I can
remember the battles pitched by su cn
mobs as the Flying Angels, the Coffins,
Checkers (all wore check-caps), Bouven-
Boys, Riley’s, and many lesser breeds.
Houses in the vicinity of the battle-
grounds often had every picket wrenefie
off the fences to provide weapons BJ
the fray. Orthodox police efforts taiie
to break up the mobs, so brawny P°hc e
men were formed into roving bands,
armed with lengths of rubber-hose. t he,,
made the pace too hot for the larrikin
and peace gradually came to sorely-trw
citizens. Present-day larrikinism nee*--
something similar.
THE ALTRUIST.
“I would rather lose my seat than see any one of
you lose yours.”— Mr, Chifley to his followers after
the close of Parliament.
An admirable declaration, clearly,
From anyone who holds the public stage,
And one that’s all too seldom voiced, sincerely
Or otherwise, in this self-righteous age
When every public man, however progressive
And ethical in all he’s said or done,
Is ever debited with an excessive
Regard for Number One.
To follow Bible rules and love your neighbor
(Or cobber) as yourself may be allowed
To be as seemly in the ranks of Labor
As any other Parliamentary crowd.
To love them better, be they few or many,
Than what’s beneath your individual hat —
Well, none of all your predecessors, Bennie,
Has gone as far as that!
It’s altruism at its best, I’m thinking,
When you can say, in praise precise and trim,
You wouldn’t care to swim if they were sinking,
Or jib at sinking if it helped them swim.
But still I wonder if the views you’re stated
With such solicitude to have expressed
Were quite as heartily reciprocated
By those whom you addressed.

“Zake”: Hollywood’s high priests of
hooey, ever on the lookout for more
fatuous forms of publicity for their pam-
pered stars, have lately been flogging the
anatomical idea to death. They started
by dubbing the groaner Sinatra “The
Voice.” After that “The Look as
applied to Lauren Bacall, who seems to
regard a Theda Bara-like sidelong glance
as the essence of histrionics, was depress-
ingly inevitable. The very latest appel-
lation is “The Shoulders,” given to some
“starlet” (or should it be hamlet?) whose
much-boosted, upper works look not the
slightest bit different from those of any
of a thousand girls seen on any Sydney
beach on a summer Sunday. I can only
hope that the stunt will go to its logical
conclusion, and that one of the many
beauteous stars who are the victims of
the filmsmiths’ inability to disguise skinny
underpinnings will attain greater fame
by being known to millions of her fans
as “The Knobs.”
* * * *
“Youanmi”: The capture in Sydney
of an alleged house-breaker by five stal-
wart ladies added to my conviction
that I’d sooner face a squadron of tanks
than females en masse. I spent my last
few months in uniform in the R.A.A.F.
camp at Victoria Park, Brisbane, which
place also accommodated a hundred or
more W.A.A.A.F. —bless ’em! They lived
in long huts, about 20 to each, and their
main worry seemed to be “prowlers” —
allegedly civilians who sneaked into the
camp from the adjacent golf course.
Approximately once a week the biddies
would panic, a call would go out for the
orderly officer, guards would be dis-
patched from the guardhouse and a
search made for the intruder. I never
heard of one being caught, nor could
I believe' thaj; any man would be
mug enough to risk- his neck in such a
stronghold of women—they were healthy,
well-nourished popsies and what a hut-
ful could have done to any solitary, un-
fortunate male would have made Madame
Defarge drop her knitting.
* * * *
“Veteran”: I wonder if I am the only
one who writhes with distaste every time
1 come acrpss the word “veteran” in
relation to service- and ex-servicemen.
Although my dislike for the word used
in this sense is real enough, I find it diffi-
cult to give the reasons for it. Perhaps
it goes back to the time when I owned a
volume of the Boys’ Own Paper, sporting
a picture of an armor-clad warrior with
patriarchial whiskers: “The Veteran.” For
men who served in both wars the title
veteran is a fitting and becoming compli-
ment, but applied to the younger lads of
the last war it is incongruous.

“V. Cluse”: Jephson was in the city
late at night for the first time for years.
Heading for home he felt a slight
tremor of doubt as he reflected on the
almost daily reports of bashing and
robbing, road accidents, bodies found in
spare allotments and so on which char-
acterise the Sydney daily press these days.
While waiting for his tram he made sure
that nobody stood within four feet of
him, watched warily any attempts to
close upon him by unknown males and
successfully escaped that peril to board
his tram. In the vehicle he got himself
a centre seat and remained on the alert
against unnamed dangers. Decanted into
his dark street, he stepped back and
allowed the ether two who got off to go
ahead of him, looked both ways before
crossing, gave a wide berth to all dark
spots, kept an ear cocked for following
footsteps. After swinging wide around
a lone individual whom he passed, Jeph-
"Do y' know, Beryl , I broke my last partner's neck doing this."
son reached his gate and walked boldly
to the side entrance. He had a key, but
the door was chained on the inside. He
rattled the door. It shot inwards and a
large and knobby fist shot outwards and
collided with Jephson’s right ear. Three
minutes later his anxious wife and her
embarrassed brother were fussing round
him, explaining that they’d taken him for
a burglar.

“Philp”: A Hollywood habit which the
war should have cured, but didn’t, is that
of referring to Australia as though it were
the remotest corner of the globe. In a
current Sherlock Holmes opus the clue
is hidden in a strange, unknown air
played by three musical boxes. After
wearing three more furrows in his brow
the Baker-street sleuth at last traces a
scrubby music-hall performer who identi-
fies the musical curiosity for him: “It’s
an old Osstralian tune called ‘The Swag-
man.’ ” I don’t know whether Doyle or
the Hollywood script-writer is. respon-
sible for the description, but, from the
tone of the actor’s voice, a Tibetan folk-
song or the national anthem of Tierra
del Fuego could not have been more of
an oddity.

“Redfern”: The wildest car ride I ever
had was when I cadged a lift back to
town one night in a car that had halted
because of temporary engine trouble.
After we had gone a couple of miles at
a fast speed, one of the chaps in the
back yelled out to the driver: “Step on
the gas and turn the next corner and keep
dodging. I think there’s a P.D. car be-
hind.” The car turned and twisted in a
maze of streets at top speed. “What’s all
the fuss about?” I asked, feeling very
jumpy. “This car’s hot, cobber,” an-
swered one of the other passengers. “We
pinched it about an hour ago.” I
"Stop foolin', Bert, an git on with the job."
muttered something about getting out and
walking home, only to be told “You’re
staying in this until we hit town. One in,
all in, pal.” The rest of the journey was
a nightmare and it cured me of hitch-
hiking for several years. I will say,
though, that the car thieves were gents
They drove me to my front doot%_and_
took care that I didn’t sight the number
of the bus.

“Nelcebee”; When workmen dug up
a man’s elastic-sided boot containing foot-
bones in an old cemetery at Whyalla
(S.A.) the town was soon seething with
wild rumors of a gruesome tragedy.
Most of Whyalla’s population has come
to the town since war brought new indus-
tries to the iron-ore port, but an old hand
was able to clear up the rpystery. There'd
been a tragedy all right, gruesome
enough, too, but it had occurred 30 years
ago. The oldster 'recalled that in 1916
two railwaymen were crushed in a train
accident. One was killed outright and the
other had a leg severed and died on the
way to hospital. The unfortunate man’s
leg, complete with boot, was buried with
police authority in the old cemetery. The
man who supplied the information had
good reason to be sure of his facts ; it was
he who buried the limb.

“W.K.D.”: Frank Forde did not always
receive a truthful “report” from the rank
and file (B. 31/7/’46). The bloke next
to me on parade was bashing my ear
about what he would tell Frank if he
asked him what he thought of the Army.
“I’ll tell him the Army stinks,” he
threatened. “The food stinks, the leave
stinks, the C.O. stinks and the whole
game stinks,” A few moments later the
Minister pulled up in front of him and
asked “Well, what do you think of the
Army, young fellow?” “Oh, it’s not too
bad,” was the reply. “Not a bad life.”
Frank looked very hard at my face as he
passed. No doubt it was a funny color.

“Sextant”: The other day a friend
asked me what would be the effect on a
high-speed ship if the rudder jammed
hard over. I told him, and whilst telling
him, my mind went back to June 29, 1941.
In company with the British destroyer
Defender, we were racing to Tobmk,
loaded with ammo and stores. It was
nearly dusk, and the Stukas were coming
at us from all directions. We dodged
them for a while, but a thousand-poundei
blew a large hole in the engine-room,
which immediately flooded. Then an-
other near-miss Jammed the rudder hard
over. 1 was on the wheel and the ship
was doing 25 knots. I could do nothing
to steady the ship, and she heeled over
dangerously. The skipper shouted “Stop
engines.” I rang through to the engine-
room, but to no avail. The engines were
still turning at high speed, as the engine-
room staff had been washed to the hatches
before being able to stop them. All hands,
including soldiers, commenced throwing
stores overboard. Our torpedoes flew out
with a roar of compressed air, as we
endeavored to lighten the ship. De-
fender, coming towards us at 30 knots,
saw our torpedoes approaching, and not
knowing we had set them to safe swerved
madly to port and lost some of her cargo.
Then suddenly, with a terrific roar of
escaping steam, we came to a stop. Stores
had been removed from a comer on deck
and the safety valve had been released.
Defender came up to use, we jumped
aboard her and departed. Do I know
what happens when a ship’s rudder jams
hard over!
* * * *
“W.O. Two”: During the war years
it was common to hear a Digger being
hailed by a civilian friend: “Why, it’s
you, Jack. Cripes, I hardly recognised
you in khaki.” Today the reverse is the
rule. The same civilian friends are greet-
ing ex-servicemen with the cry: “Blimey,
I hardly knew you in your civvy clobber.”
Whether one can spot a pal who has
changed his clothes for a uniform quicker
than when he changes back from khaki
to his peace-time garb is a poser that I
am not prepared to answer. At the same
time one is often surprised at the first
sight of an army acquaintance in ordinary
rigout. I saw my old C.O. clad in a pair
of baggy slacks and a crumpled sports-
coat battling through a crowd in a chain-
store the same day as I saw a chap who
was the hygiene corporal in the same
unit. The ex-corp. was dressed in the
height of fashion and was the centre of
an equally well-dressed circle of drinkers
in an exclusive saloon bar.
* * * *
“Bondi Beachcomber”: That ammo
cache at Rabaul (B. 31/7/’46) reminds
me of an earlier find that included flare-
bombs. It caused no excitement until
somebody remembered that flares hang
from parachutes. Only way to get the
silk prize from the cylinder was to ex-
plode the bomb; soon the area comman-
dant was curious about the nightly ex-
plosions which lit the sky for minutes on
end. Bluey and his mob, camped close
to H.Q. .on the slopes of extinct
Namanula, decided to ignite their flares
in a tunnel, not realising that it went clean
through to H.Q. on the other side of the
ridge. They got a dozen chutes and some
smoke-sore eyes and were happy —until
parades and inquiries next morning re-
vealed the chaos they’d caused. H.Q.
officers had had their batmen working
half the night moving belongings when,
eyes and noses assailed by smoke pouring
from the hillside, they’d thought, “Old
Namanula is breaking out again, in a
fresh place.”

“Curate’s Egg”: In my callow youth a
stranger accosted me in Pitt-street, with a
plausible tale of a job he had been
promised out Penrith way. The pro-
spective employer had either been an
impostor or else had fallen victim to the
strong waters of Sydney; my accoster was
now stranded. Two shillings would
secure him a bed and breakfast in the
morning, whest he would call on the
employment agency which had arranged
the introduction. I parted up and lie went
his way blessing me. Last week in Bris-
bane a chap wearing a civvy jungle-green
ensemble stuck me up with a tale, which,
with the exception that Helidon was sub-
stituted for Penrith, tallied with the one
which had separated me from two-bob in
Sydney 20 years ago. I recognised, de-
spite the ageing lines on his countenance,
the str—ied nth-job applicant.

“E.H.G.”: Typhus, spread by lice, was
taking terrible toll among Russian, French
and Yugoslav p.-0.-w. in Austria early in
1942. Yet when a British medical officer
at Stalag 18a offered 50 cigarettes for
the capture of a louse in the British com-
pound, the smokes were never claimed;
which speaks volumes for the enforce-
ment of anti-typhus precautions among
the Empire prisoners. A Cypriot prisoner
was determined to collect the reward, and
made up his mind to get a louse by fair
means or foul. The Russian compound
was separated from ours by a sort of No-
man’s Land about 50ft. wide, and two
high barbed-wire fences. The Cypriot
used to hang around the gate trying to
convey to the wondering Russians that
he wanted a louse. The Russians were
crawling with lice, but every time the
Cypriot —by pantomime and gesticulation
—indicated to them that he was referring
to lice, broad grins would spread across
their faces, and they would nod their
• heads emphatically as if to say, “Yeah,
we’ve got millions of ’em ourselves!”

HAMBURGERS.
‘‘Dozens of prime young horses, as well as worn-
out old ones, are being sold for slaughter every
week in Sydney, and it is current gossip in the meat
industry that numbers of them finish up in ham-
burgers.”—-‘Sunday Sun.”
What is the sausage but a bag of mystery
Whose flavor anybody may enjoy
With scant concern about its previous history?
And what the appetising saveloy?
Let whoso will to baleful hints give credence
And muttered innuendoes. I prefer
To be oblivious of the antecedent's
Ev’n of a hamburger.
But mow I hear some shocked voice ask, of
course, as
Was unavoidable, you may depend;
“Being Australian, don’t you count the horse as
Man’s first and firmest and most faithful
friend?
Can you conceive yourself as lunching lightly
On chunks, however succulently done,
Of what illustrious Gordon sang so brightly,
And ‘Banjo’ Paterson?
“Does it not trouble you, when nightly homing.
To think hot dogs to which you glue your lips
May be the kin of Carbine and of Gloaming,
Or the remote descendants of Eclipse?
Or that in which you plunge a questing grinder
When at some dingy conee-stall you sup
Might, had inexorable Fate been kinder,
Have won a Melbourne Cup?”
Well, brother, frankly answering your question,
I have no notion why it should impair
Either appreciation or digestion
Of this essentially nocturnal fare.
If it be camouflaged adroitly, showing
No outward trace of any equine strain,
i’ll bet we’ve relished it before, unknowing,
And doubtless will again.
What’s hidden from the eye, beyond mistaking.
It’s somewhere in the Bible plain and flat,
Will set no heart disconsolately aching—
No stomach either, for the matter o’ that.

Rest well assured what’s going intp your ipner

Malaria in the A.M.F.
Year after year before the war came in
September, 1939, The Bulletin cam-
paigned for the amalgamation of Papua
and Mandated New Guinea under one
administration, and for the effective
defence of both territories as a vital part
of the defence of Australia. This neces-
sarily would have meant the establish-
ment of a trained medical service giving
proper attention to the mapping of
regions in which tropical diseases are
endemic —malaria, scrub typhus, pellagra,
beriberi, dermatitis and the rest —and the
provision of uniforms, underwear, foot-
wear, nets, mixed diets and so forth suited
to local conditions, together with ample
stocks of preventive and curative drugs.
“Ek Dum” wrote most of the articles.
Support came from Papua and New
Guinea, but from no other quarter.
Newspapers, especially in Sydney, were
absorbed in other matters, particularly
the flapper cult, horse- and dog-racing
and the might and benevolence of Soviet
Russia, and one and all were against uni-
versal training and service, which boded
no good to circulation. Politicians were
also against it on the score of votes. And
these ignoble views’ prevailed.
The time came when the neglected
regions had to be occupied and held by
great forces and they—Australians and
Americans—did the job grandly. But it
entailed vast and—had time been taken
by the forelock—largely preventible
hazards and suffering, as witness a report
dealing with the incidence of malaria,
written for the “Medical Journal” by
Brigadier Hamilton Fairley, Director of
Medicine.
It begins with the statement that “every
campaign conducted by the Australian
Military Forces in the South-west Pacific
from the outbreak of war with Japan
until April, 1944, when the conquest of the
Huon Peninsula ended, was accompanied
by a severe outbreak of malaria. In all
instances a large portion of the forces
concerned was affected.” Then follows
this appalling paragraph:
Up to June, 1943, approximately 25,000
patients suffering from malaria were re-
corded as admitted to medical units. From
that date until January 31, 1945, some
67,172 individuals were recorded as having
had malaria. They suffered 132,014 attacks
of the disease and spent a total of 2,545,585
days in hospital. This enormous drain on
manpower resources was particularly severe
in operational units and formations, which,
suffered by far the heaviest incidence.
There was one cheering factor:
Deaths directly due to malaria were un-
common. This was due not to the mildness
of the infection, but to early and adequate
treatment, especially to the universal prac-
tice of giving quinine intravenously in all
doubtful cases. The actual mortality rate
from uncomplicated malaria in. these cam-
paigns has not exceeded 1 in 3000.
For this result —though the brigadier
does not say so—the servicemen and the
nation can thank in the main the Aus-
tralian Army Medical Corps, whose
noble and self-sacrificing work in the
most exacting circumstances makes a
splendid contribution to Australian his-
tory.
During most of 1942 and part of 1943
there was a shortage of nearly every re-
quirement, particularly quinine. When
the “Fight for Australia in Java!” cry
was heard from the Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph” office “approximately 100 tons of;
quinine was paid for by the
Government; but, owing to loss by 1
enemy action, the inevitable difficulty
facing a country on the verge of inva-
sion and possibly fifth-column activity,
none reached Australia.” Stocks of
quinine were temporarily augmented by
consignments from Great Britain, always
generous to its partners; and the Old
Country sent atebrin also. At the special
instance of knight Alan Newton, chair-
man of the Medical Equipment Control
Committee, other supplies of atebrin were
obtained from the U.S.A. when they had
fallen very low; and in process of time
all requirements were met.
To the eternal disgrace of the “Gov-
ernment” “mosquito nets were scarce and
of inferior quality, with such a poor air-
flow that troops experienced great diffi-
culty in sleeping under them.” The in-
vention and energy of the medical ser-
vices and their associated scientists,
Anglo-American as well as Australian,
solved the problem caused by this dis-
graceful deficiency, and other problems:
Specifications for a new Nottingham type
of mosquito netting were laid down This
became a standard type for the British
Army as well as the Australian Armed
Forces. Dimethyl phthalate had been found
by American entomologists to be the most
suitable mosquito repellent, effective against
both mosquitoes and mites, and it could be
manufactured in Australia. Later, in a
most important series of field experiments
in Australia and New Guinea Major R. N.
McCulloch showed the superiority of
dibutyl phthalate as a mite larvicide, its par-
ticular virtue when applied to clothing
, being that it afforded more prolonged pro-
tection, not being washed out so readily.
Meanwhile 50 per cent, of the troops
in the Moresby area, thought to be “only
mildly malarious,” became infected with
malaria, and soldiers carried the infec-
tion to Cairns, where “there was an epi-
demic of benign tertian malaria involving
over 600 civilians.” A serious matter, for
“Australian troops were garrisoning the
Cairns area and it was of vital importance
to prevent Allied bases in Northern Aus-
tralia from becoming malarious”; and
there was, of course, the possibility that
the epidemic might spread to the south.
The alarm felt was allayed “as the result
of researches undertaken by Dr. G. A.
M. Heydon and military entomologists at
Cairns.”
It was proved that Anop' :les punctulatus
moluccensis was the vector. This enabled
rational measures to be instituted and
clarified the whole position regarding malaria
transmission in tropical Australia. For
this species of mosquito is not found be-
low 30deg. south latitude.
Later Major F. H. S. Roberts proved that
another anopheline mosquito, annulipes, is
capable of causing small outbreaks of
malaria. Though it has a widespread geo-
graphical distribution in Australia it for-
tunately is only of minor importance.
The Milne Bay, Kokoda, Buna and
Wau campaigns were hard on the troops
in every respect, above all in point of
malaria cases. A report prepared for the
War Cabinet early in 1943 “left little
doubt that if malaria casualties continued
at the high level attained in the Milne
Bay and Buna-Gona campaigns it would
not be possible to maintain the requisite
number of divisions at fighting strength.”
There followed the appointment of “a
personal advisory committee to General
MacArthur, comprising Army, Air Force
and Navy experts of Australia and the
U.S.A., with Colonel M. J. Holmes,
A.A.M.C., as chief executive officer”;
The activities of this committee were
little known, but they achieved a common
Allied policy in forward medical planning,
in the cure, control and prevention of dis-
ease, and in preventing the introduction of
tropical disease into Australia.
Little known likewise was the work of
the Land Headquarters Medical Research
Unit assembled at Cairns. Undertaking
exhaustive experiments with, in the first
place, sulphamerazine, quinine and
atebrin, it established that atebrin
was “a very effective suppressant
of benign tertian arid malignant
tertian malaria.” Hence an order
for the administration of atebrin to all
troops, commanders being held respon-
sible. And before the Huon Peninsula
was seized other measures had been
taken:
Equipment was improved. Adequate pro-
tective clothing was issued to all ranks.
Mosquito nets of improved pattern and
material were available. Dimethyl phthalate
was manufactured in quantity. Malaria-
control units were attached to operational
forces.
Nevertheless, malaria casualties were
still high, though not so high in the Huon
Valley as at Milne Bay or Buna-Gona.
It came out that - atebrin had not been
taken as prescribed. Though Brigadier
'Fairley does not say so, a rumor swept
through the islands like a willy-willy that
atebrin caused sterility. When and where it
was realised that “benign tertian malaria
could be completely suppressed by 0.4
gramme of atebrin a week and that 0.6
to 0.7 gramme a week, would not only
suppress but cure malignant tertian mal-
aria,” there was a great and steady im-
provement except in Aitape-Wewak. In
that region 4838 men out of 17,500 in the
Sixth Division had one or more malaria
attacks in the course of jungle fighting
for over 11 months, though there were
only four deaths. Almost everywhere the
risk of infection remained.
Brigadier Fairley has written a mourn-
ful, but splendid, report. It should be
compulsory reading for politicians
charged with the duty of arranging for
the defence of Australia and its islana
territories and with that of re-establishing
malaria sufferers in civil life.

Many people imagine that Fate has deprived them of the
good things of life success, popularity, radiant health,
the fulfilment of their cherished hopes and dreams. But
if they only knew it frustration and disappointment come
from within, from negative forces and influences deep within
the Subconscious Mind, and until these forces are eradicated
they can have little hope of happiness or achievement.

younger than seven Commonwealth
“Labor” Ministers and 20 years younger
than an eighth; but he is 60, so out he
goes.
Lavarack was commissioned in the
Royal Australian Artillery Regiment
(Permanent) in 1905, and served in coast
defence and other appointments till
selected, in 1913, to attend the Staff
College, Camberley, England.
At Camberley he qualified with high
honors, and he stepped almost straight
into World War I, in which he served
with the British Army and then as
G.S.O. I to Major-General William Glas-
gow, Fourth Australian Division. He came
out with the D.S.O. and the French
Croix de Guerre.
That war over, Lavarack became
Director of Training and Operations,
Commandant of Duntroon and
1935-39 —Chief of the General Staff,
during the vital years of preparation for
World War 11. He it was who raised and
led the Seventh Division in the Middle
East. He commanded the First Corps
in Syria, and the defence of Tobruk was
one of the results of his great talent for
strategy. For a time he was Wavell’s
right-hand man in the N.E.I. (of this
much wholly creditable to him remains
to be written, and it won’t be written by
any “Fight for Australia in Java” press-
boy), and from 1942 to 1944 he
was G.O.C. First Army during the New
Guinea operations. Thence he went to
Washington, where he worked in close
co-operation with the Allied Chiefs,
Marshall, Nimitz 'and Alanbrooke.
At the Imperial Defence College in
-1925-1927 Lavarack propounded the idea
that Australia should rely for its defence
primarily on a really strong Army and
Air Force, with sufficiently serviceable
naval forces, and not depend unduly on a
doubtful protection to be furnished by
the establishment of the Singapore base.
Admiral Richmond, who was at the
college during Lavarack’s term, decried
the idea, arguing that Australia had little
to worry about if there was a strong
Singapore. The admiral apparently en-
visaged some magical impregnable for-
tress capable of moving itself to
threatened areas in the Pacific, including
Newcastle, Sydney and Auckland, and
destroying any enemy at will. He failed
to realise that Singapore was strategically
unsound ; that is to say, there was no
obligation on the part of Japan to attack
it in the process of an advance on Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. Singapore could
be by-passed.
As it happened the Japs decided to
crush the American Pacific fleet at Pearl
Harbor to prevent interruption on their
left flank, and then to attack Singapore
and capture it as a base for the Australia-
New Zealand offensive and the seizure
of the N.E.I. The felon blow they de-
livered led in the end to their being
knocked out.
Lavarack had rightly contended in his
controversy with Admiral Richmond that
the time might come when Britain would
be unable to detach a major naval force
to the Far East, and that therefore Aus-
tralia and New Zealand must be defen-
sively self-contained. He labored to
secure a greater proportion of the meagre
Australian defence vote for the land and
air forces* In this he had the help of
Lieut.-General Wyuter. What he visu-
alised came to pass ; hard-pressed Britain
unselfishly dispatched the ill-fated Re-
pulse and Prince of Wales, to Singapore.
With practically no air support, owing
to the diversion of air strength by Britain
to help clamorous Russia at a critical
period, these ships were lost; and from
that moment Singapore was doomed.
The lesson advocated by Lavarack and
Wynter, that Australia and New Zealand
must provide their own local defence,
appears to be not understood by Aus-
tralians who should know better. Social
services, sport, alcohol and tobacco are
in a higher priority than national defence,
the expectation being that in another
desperate emergency Britain or America
will save us again. Before Singapore
was commenced, many navy and army
men were convinced that it was unsound
to construct a vital base in territory
owned, controlled or influenced by a
foreign Power. A base is a haven of
refuge for ships of war and merchant
ships. It refits, re-equips and refuels all
three services, and performs many other
functions in regard to personnel, supply,
etc., but it also should constitute a hard
core or bastion of resistance against
enemy attack by sea, air or land, A con-
sideration that will be increasingly im-
portant under atomic-warfare conditions.
Bom in Brisbane, son of a North
Queenslander, Lavarack may become
Governor of Queensland, But, consider-
ing his unique experiences in all quarters
of the globe and his proved ability as a
strategist and tactician, and in view of the
need for a virile defence policy in Aus-
tralia, surely some use can be found for
this ex-A.I.F. general’s talents as a con-
sultant or adviser, A sort of precedent
has been established in the case of ex-
I.W.W. General Donald Grant.
The R.A.A.F.
“O.F”: Air Minister Drakeford, who
has “King” Cole as an opponent in Mari-
byrnong (Vic.), was obviously pleased to
believe that he had heard the last of Air
Vice-Marshal Bostock’s criticism of
R.A.A.F. administration —one feature of
the controversy was a statement by U.S.
General Kenney that, as Commander of
the Allied Air Forces in the S.W.P.A., he
found Bostock a “loyal, efficient and
courageous colleague.” But the Minister
has not heard the last of the matter by
any means. 4
At the end of the war the R.A.A.F.
was under the control of an Air Board of
six members, plus the secretary of the
Department of Air as an ex officio
member. The senior member of the board
was the Chief of Air Staff. To him were
assigned the Directorates of Tactics and
Operational Requirements, Air Staff
Policy, Organisation, Telecommunications
and Radar, Staff Duties, Meteorological
Services, Flying Safety and the Inspec-
torate of Administration.
The Air Member for Personnel was
made responsible for the Directorates of
Postings, Personal Services, Training,
Medical Services, Manning, Educational
Services, the W.A.A.A.F. and the Air
Training Corps; under him also was the
Judge Advocate General. To the Air
Member for Supply and Equipment went
the Directorates of Works and Buildings,
Equipment, Supply and Services, Trans-
portation and Movements, Air Force
Postal Services and Canteen Services; to
the Air Member for Engineering and
Maintenance the Directorates of Tech-
nical Services, Repair and Maintenance,
Armament and Aeronautical Inspection.
The other two members were civilians:
the Finance Member (under him an Assis-
tant Chief Finance Officer, a Director of
Unit Accounts and a Chief Accountant)
and the Business Member, whose job it
was to advise the Board on the “feasibility
or practicability of any proposals from
the commercial angle.”
All this outfit made up R.A.A.F. Head-
quarters, occupying a large part of Vic-
toria Barracks, Melbourne, and over-
flowing into Albert Park. The number
of R.A.A.F. and W.A.A.A.F. employed
was a trade secret or something, but it
ran into thousands. The main or intended
function of the whole set-up was the
administrative control of the R.A.A.F.
Operational control — i.e., fighting com-
mand —was another matter. Early in the
Pacific war it was deemed expedient to
place the R.A.A.F. in the South-west
Pacific area under the direct control of
the Commander of the Allied Air Forces.
So, in 1942, R.A.A.F. Command was
created to exercise operational control
of all R.A.A.F. operational formations
and operational units, and was placed
Under the direct operational control of
Allied Air Force Headquarters. R.A.A.F.
Headquarters, Melbourne, kept to itself
“such matters as personnel, provision and
maintenance of aircraft, supply and equip-
ment, works and buildings and the train-
ing of the R.A.A.F.” That was the
theory; in fact, R.A.A.F. Headquarters
retained, directly or indirectly, almost
complete control of the Air Force.
Dual control of R.A.A.F, Command
and R.A.A.F. Headquarters was unsatis-
factory from the beginning, and Genera!
MacArthur was highly critical of it. But
the trouble went deeper than the disor-
ganisation produced by divided control.
R.A.A.F. Command—and all the opera-
tional units under it —was subject to
operational orders from Allied Air Force
H.Q. and administrative orders from
R.A.A.F. H.Q. As the fighting head-
quarters of the Air Force, R.A.A.F. Com-
mand was subservient to the administra-
tive set-up, and the R.A.A.F.’s senior
operational commander was subject to
the dictates of a Board of which he was
not even a member.
The R.A.A.F. is in the throes of re-
organisation, of which too little has been
heard. R.A.A.F. Command was dis-
banded shortly after the end of the war,
and there have since been too many indi-
cations, especially if Mr. Drakeford re-
mains in a position to meddle, that the
core of the Permanent Air Force will
consist largely of those who filled ad-
ministrative posts during the war. Mr.
Drakeford blurted out that General
Kenney’s “loyal, efficient and courageous
colleague” could not expect to be re-
tained in the R.A.A.F. because he was
critical of its organisation. If that
“policy” governs the selection of all Per-
manent Air Force officers heaven help
the Permanent Air Force!

PERSONAL ITEMS
Group-Capt. P. G. (Paddy) Heffernan,
who has been posted as Senior Air
Staff Officer at overseas H.Q., London, is
no stranger to Britain —he was there in
1943 commanding an operational unit in
Bomber Command. A tiger for flying,
he was stopped by a crash which put him
in hospital for a long time. At first he
was not expected to live, and when he
convinced the staff that his time had not
come it seemed unlikely he would ever
walk again. He confounded the authorities
and recovered. On his return to Australia
Heffernan took over command at Rich-
mond for a while before becoming
Director of Training at R.A.A.F. H.Q.,
which post he is vacating.
There are some sturdy veterans and
hardy annuals in the State Parliament of
Westralia, which reassembled last month,
and nobody quite knows who is endued
to be called Father of the House —or
Houses. Sydney Stubbs can show the
heaviest tale of years ; he is 85 and has
been M.L.A. for Wagin since 1911, But
Vernon Hamersley has the longest span
of unbroken Parliamentary service, having
been an M.L.C. since 1904. Phil Collier,
a former Labor Premier, isn’t far behind
him ; Boulder sent him to the Assembly
in 1905, and has kept him there ever
since. W. D. Johnson dates his appear-
ance as an M.L.A. from 1901, when he
was returned with the very first batch of
Labor members—half a dozen in all —
but W.D. had two terms and a bit out of
Parliament owing to the fickleness of con-
stituents. Finally there is J. M. Drew, the
only pre-Federation legislator who still
survives. Drew was elected an M.L.C. as
far back as May, 1900, but his period of
service, like Johnson’s, hasn’t been con-
tinuous —he was out from 1918 to 1924,
Since the German V 2 made the rocket
fantasies of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells
seem less unlikely of fulfilment, comic-
strip artists and newspaper columnists
have been letting their heads go on the
subject of early trips to the moon. Some
scientists, too, have been prophesying on
the subject—an American recently fore-
cast that within 15 years rocket ships of
1500 tons would be making the journey.
Professor Kerr Grant, of Adelaide Uni-
versity, has poured cold water on the
project, describing it as a silly idea and
utterly fantastic, Kerr Grant warns
would-be moon-wanderers that their first
sensation on the moon would be of sea-
sickness on an unimaginable scale, owing
to a loss of about 95 per cent, gravity.
Adelaide University’s professor of physics
cannot he dismissed as a man opposed
to modern ideas. He was one of the
first scientists in Australia to split the
atom —he was demonstrating that sport in
his laboratory 20 years ago. One of his
students was Marcus Oliphant, since
famous in connection with atomic re-
search. Kerr Grant is a Victorian who
has been at Adelaide Uni. since 1909.
Percy Edgar Deane, dead in Melbourne
at 56, probably knew more about the
inside history of the Versailles Peace
Conference than any man in Australia —
excluding, of course, Billy Hughes. He
was a young man of 28 when he attended
the conference as secretary to the Aus-
tralian delegation ; two years earlier he
had been pulled out of the A.I.F. to be-
come Hughes’s secretary, and he also be-
came assistant secretary to the Imperial
War Cabinet. At the Imperial Confer-
ences of 1918, 1921 and 1926 Percy again
had the job of shepherding the Common-
wealth team. He was a vital, irrepressible
personality who never allowed himself to
be overawed by the importance of names
or occasions, and after 20 years in Gov-
ernment service he still retained his strong
individuality when ill health forced his
retirement ten years ago.
Appointed to fill the two vacancies on
the Victorian County Court Bench, caused
by the retirement through ill-health of
Judges Macindoe and Magennis, are two
well-known Melbourne barristers, F. B.
Gamble and G. L. Dethridge, Judge
Dethridge, second of his family to gain
the distinction —an uncle was Dethridge
of the Arbitration Court —is 42, was edu-
cated at Haileybury College, Brighton,
and Melbourne Uni, and is one of the
youngest Judges to be appointed. In the
last State election, standing as a Labor
man, he came within 300 votes of
Michaelis for the St. Kilda seat. Judge
Gamble is an ex-soldier and an athlete.
He rowed for Wesley and won his blue
at Melbourne University in 1919. With
the A.I.F. in the late war he served in
the M.E. and New Guinea, and was
appointed colonel and Director of Re-
search and Civil Affairs under Genet al
Blarney. Me arranged the military gov-
ernment of Borneo after the capitulation.
A double tragedy has struck Wesley
College, Melbourne, sudden heart attacks
removing first N. H. Mac Neil, its head-
master for seven years, and 12 days later,
A. E. Gwilliam, has acting successor.
A. E. Gwilliam, who was 62, joined the
college in 1908 and taught there continu-
ously without any serious illness. He
was a former president of the Victorian
Assistant-Masters’ Association. Wesley
has had 10 headmasters in its 50 years of
existence, the famous L. A. Adamson
holding the position for 32 years.
Except for a period of service with the
Royal Montreal Artillery in the firstl
German war, during which he was
wounded, Frank W. Fraser, Canadian
Trade [Commissioner, has mainly walked
the paths of commerce, official and
unofficial. He once managed a paper-
box factory in New Brunswick, his
RECIPROCAL TRADE.
birthplace, and before that imported
newsprint in New York. He became a
trade commissioner in 1925, and has since
been looking after his country’s interests
in U.S., Dublin and Jamaica. A graduate
of Mount Allison University with a B.A.
degree, he has seen his two children
graduate from the same academy.
Murray Griffin, appointed drawing
master at Melbourne National Gallery
school in succession to William Rowell,
held his first exhibition at the Athenaeum
with Ernest Buckmaster just after leaving
the school in which he is now a teacher.
He held another unusual show when he
exhibited sketches and paintings of his
fellow-prisoners in Changi, into which
camp he landed after Singapore’s fall.
Before he went north as an official war
artist he was design instructor at the
Melbourne Tech, and was Art master at
Scotch College for ten years.
The unofficial R.A.A.F. war art on
show at the Athenaeum, Melbourne, was
done by Vernon Jones in his spare time,
often during the hurly-burly of offensive
warfare and under the most arduous and
aggravating conditions. The ’artist
served for some time as a defence officer
with a Beaufighter wing in operational
areas, and many of his pictures were
completed weeks and often months be-
fore it was possible for official artists to
arrive on the scene. Some of his paint-
ings could never have been executed
in any other circumstances, inas-
much as they are portraits of young air-
men who later gave their lives. The
amount of painting Jones accom-
plished in the intervals between his fight-
ing is surprising. He has placed on
record most of the notable figures, and
if some of the sketches belong to the
caricaturist class others have been
worked up into gallery paintings, some
of which were done on tent canvas. One
of the best is of the Tarakan landing,
which can be followed in all its confused
detail.
A Melbourne solicitpr, like his immedi-
ate superior, Wing-Commander G. O.
Reid, Deputy-director of Personal Service
at Air Board, has resumed practice after
six years’ service with the R.A.A.F., most
of which was spent in Melbourne. He
was appointed to the casualty section in
1941, and supervised the notification of
14,000 casualties and the investigations
concerning some 6000 missing members
of the R.A.A.F. He visited U.S.A., Great
Britain and Europe in 1944 in connection
with the repatriation of p.-0.-w. from
Germany. When the Nips threw in the
sponge he went to Manila and Singapore
to help organise the bringing home of
R.A.A.F. prisoners. He was responsible
for setting up an organisation to inquire
into the fate of lost members of air-crew
in the Pacific area,
“F.S.” on the passing of H.G.W.:
Wells was born into a poor lower-middle-
class family. His father was an unambitious
and easygoing man, a professional cricketer.
His mother was a lady’s maid, who when on
tour with her titled mistress used to send home
letters full of descriptive passages culled from
servants’ hall fiction. At 13 Wells had com-
pleted a primary-school education and had
been apprenticed to a draper, it was scarcely
the environment out of which genius coufd be
expected, but Wells’s father broke his leg and
thus threw on to his son’s shoulders the whole
burden of the family. Then Wells broke his
leg, and while convalescing read voraciously all
the books he could get hold,of. The youth
took to science, got his B.Sc. degree and be-
came a science teacher. Then he came in touch
with Dr. Briggs, the father of cramming.
Briggs had discovered that examiners always
asked pretty much the same old questions, and
after a prolonged and scientific study of ex-
amination papers he whittled down the ques-
tions that were most often asked on any sub-
ject to 100. He provided perfect answers to
the questions. Wells was one of his assistants,
and their success was amazing, scores of men
who subsequently became eminent in science
and medicine graduating from this sausage
factory. At one of the little seminaries in which
Wells taught was a pupil named Harmsworth,
subsequently Lord Northclilfe. Weils didn’t
foresee that in the brain of young Harmsworth
was the germ of the new journalism, any more
than the pupil recognised in Wells the future
populariser of science, socialism, economics;
“the Archimandrite of the half-educated.”
Then Wells read a passage in a play by
Barrie which gave him the key to freelance
literature. A few years later editors all over
the country were outbidding each other for his
articles, stories and prophetic sayings. His-
torians find faults in his Outline of History, bmt
he was the first man to write history from a
universal viewpoint; in Kipps and Tono-Bungay
he made a living picture of his social back-
ground and put living people in them, and
there was life even about such queer novels as
The War of the Worlds and the scientific stories.
Lenin called him “hopelessly middle-class,”
but he was more than that —he was an artist.
Retiring after 32 years of the R.A.N. to
take on the job of chief rehabilitation
officer in the Victorian Social Services
Department, Instructor Captain Morton
Henry Moyfcs, 0.8. E., B.Sc., F.R.G.S.,
can look back on a career of varied mari-
time experience. With the Australasian
Antarctic Expedition of 1912-14, he was
a member of the Second Base Party at
Queen Mary Land. He went south again
with the Shackleton Relief Expedition of
REHA BI LIT A TION.

1916, and was survey officer of the Dis-
covery on the 1929-30 Antarctic Expedi-
tion. His two Polar ribbons give a chaste
effect to the usual “fruit salad” of decora-
tions. Born in 1887 at Koolunga, S.A.,
Moyes is a St. Peters old boy who was a
tower of strength to Adelaide ’Varsity
athletics. In 1906-07-08 he won the S.A.
high and broad jump titles and the inter-
’Varsity high jump; in 1908 he carried
off the inter-’Varsity broad jump as well.
Later he “repped” for the Navy in cricket
and tennis. A. science master at St.
Peters and later at Townsville and Rock-
hampton Grammar Schools, he entered
the Naval College at Geelong in 1914
and served in many ships of the R.A.N.
Since 1943 he has been Director of Edu-
cation and Vocational Training, R.A.N.
His brother John is Bishop of Armidale.
Early in 1938 a young lad of 16
wandered into The Bulletin office with
a bundle of drawings. Though immature,
the sketches showed a freedom of line
and there was originality behind them.
From that time on joke-blocks by “Heth”
began to creep into Bulletin pages.
Norman Hetherington was a student at
Sydney Tech, and worked at commercial
art for a firm of advertising agents till
DEBUT.
he joined the Army in 1941. Before long
he found himself in Jim Davidson’s En-
tertainment Unit as a lightning sketch
artist. Lightning sketches were only a
part of the job—in between times he
painted backdrops, got out posters and
improvised scenery and props from any
material he could scrounge. Every now
and then he found time to post off a joke-
block to 252 Geoirge-street. Discharged
from the Army a few months ago, he
joined the staff of The Bulletin and
Prior’s drawing shows him breaking
triumphantly through his first “full page.”
Most cities have a few street identities
who are so well-known by their nick-
names that they are seldom thought of as
having real names until a brief paragraph
in a newspaper records their death. Such
a one was Francis Roland Bee, Adelaide’s
“Piccolo Pete,” who died early this
month. Since pre-depression days Pete
and his tin-whistle have been as much a
feature of the night scene in Adelaide
as the Cafe de Fairfax is of Sydney after
dark. Even his greatest admirers would
not claim for him any notable degree of
skill on the instrument and highbrow
critics deplored his habit of breaking off
in the middle of a bar to retrieve pennies
thrown just out of reach, but “Piccolo
Pete” had become an institution and
Adelaide misses him.
Into the silence:
At Wondai (C.Q.), aged 94, Joseph James
Bushnell, one of the last surviving finks with
Queensland’s early days. Born at Wetheron
station, where his father was manager, he saw
the rich Burnett country develop from primi-
tive outback conditions into a closely settled
and prosperous farming and dairying district.
Mentally and physically a remarkably active
man, he enjoyed his daily horseback exercise
up to a few days before his death.
Dead, at 74, while on a visit to Sydney, John
Jereos Lucas, of Melbourne, Consul for Greece
for many years. Born in the lonian Islands,
he came to Melbourne in 1886 and opened the
Town Hall Cafe and later the Vienna Cafd
He was noted for his many benefactions, for
his annual £lOO gift to the Lord Mayor’s Fund
and for large sums in aid of the bombed
children of Britain and the starving ones in
Greece. ;
At Proserpine (Q.), at' 73, Henry Tyser
Macartney, son and grandson of early-Queens-
land pastoralists, and great-grandson of the
famous Victorian churchman Dean Macartney,
who preached his last sermon in Melbourne m
his hundredth year.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
The breeze outside the Town Hall was
Arctic, but the setting inside was tropic.
Along the middle of the hall were
rounded little islands of green from which
tall palms arose—not so tall as the ones
in Bridge-street between Pitt and George
streets, but the same idea in miniature.
But the suggestion of heat did not do
much to warm the spines of those at the
Lord Mayor’s reception to Governor
Northcott and his Lady. There were 500
guests, and the women snuggled deeply
into fur capes. Some even kept their
coats on. The foyer, too, was a delusion
and a snare, for at the first entry the four
corners seemed as though warmed by
radiators in a grotto. But this was merely
a clever stage effect.
Still, restrictions being what they are,
and Monday’s summer having switched
back to winter, the frozen few made as
merry as might be. Everybody was pre-
sented, and Frank Crane gets special
decoration for being such an efficient aide.
The Lord Mayor and the Mayoress, the
Governor and Mrs. Northcott stood for
the handshakes in a small area marked
with green boundaries. Later the official
group moved to a dais in front of the
stage, which was all greeny fern through
which filtered strains of organ music,
Mrs. Northcott’s parma violet frock
and a silver fox cape kept company
throughout. A mink cape and crepes of
hydrangea blue were worn by the Lady
Mayoress ; deep lilac in toning were Miss
Elizabeth Northcott’s moires. The official
secretary L. A. Robbs, from Government
House, were at the party ; so was attrac-
tive Sheila Collett. Town Clerk f£oy
Hendy and his wife, the Hubert Fair-
faxes, Colonel Spain, and former
Mayoresses Mrs. George Parkes and Mrs.
Neville Harding were among the many.
The National Anthem was played at
about twenty to eleven.
From entrance to exit the Robert Dix-
son party was in the orchid class. Food,
drinks and flower compositions, the last
mostly trails of cymbidium, were of the
usual Elwatan quality—no chance of a
hot-dog getting even his nose in there.
Joan Hammond was the guest of honor,
and the late Sunday afternoon party was
to give members of the committee who
had worked for the singer’s farewell
testimonial a chance to meet her. Mrs.
Robert Dixsm, who is a trustee of the
Joan Hammond fund, hostessed in a
frock of soft powder blue, and daughter
Mrs. Ivan Black, wearing flowered silks,
helped in entertaining.
Husband Ivan Black and Mrs. Dixson’s
brother. Brigadier Holland, were alert
and efficient aides. The Walter Swinsons,
the Hubert Fairfaxes, Miss Leo Wray,
pretty little Mrs. Falkiner Blaxland with
her tall doctor husband, the Charles
Moses couple and A.B.C.’s Mr. and Mrs.
Burnett, the Butters lady, the Harold
Botts, her frock a deep hyacinth blue,
the Roy Evans couple (pianist Trixie
Tange), the Raymond Beatties, the Hope
Gibsons, Mrs. Holland and June Hol-
land were in the shifting groups about
the big rooms. To drive to Elwatan, on
the top of Castle Hill, in the soft sunset
looking out over the spreading distances
is an experience only equalled in beauty
by driving along the road under a clear
sky blazing with stars gazing out over
distances patterned with city lights.
The night looked forward to for weeks
—perhaps it would be even more correct
to say, for years —by the committee of
her farewell concert arrived, and on
Wednesday of last week Joan Hammond
gave the first concert of her season in the
Town Hall. The place was thronged, and
at a very early hour the foyer was buzzing
with concert-goers who had travelled
early by hourly train or skeleton service.
Though it must be owned that transport
cannot strictly be exclusive to cadavers,
most of the journeyers looked in fair,
round body. A bus-load of schoolgirls
was decanted on the pavement at the
entrance to the Town Hall, and were
snugly placed in one of the galleries.
Mrs. Robert Dixson was an early
arrival, accompanied by her husband.
Miss Kate Egan and Miss Leo Wray and
a battalion of women golfers (Joan was
once of their company), Mrs, Hope Gib-
son and Mrs. Macartney were others who
lingered over the long table piled with
flowers for the singer. This had been
placed in the foyer that all might see, and
bending over the massed fragrance were
also Mrs. Keith Morris and son Barry,
Mrs. Mick Dalton, of Kangaroobie, and
daughter Mrs. Hardie, Mrs. John Woods
and Mrs. R. Fagan. Mrs. Cliff Gearin,
her unusual cape of ermine outlined in
silver fox, much admired, was in the
group. Seen also were singers Nathalie
Rosenwax, Gladys yerona, Evelyn
Lynch, Alice Prowse, the Roland Fos-
ters and Miss Jobson, whose approving
comment on her former pupil at P.L.C.,
and Hopewood House, was “she has
worked hard.”
At eight fifteen pianist Raymond Lam-
bert opened the concert with Bach-
Rummel and Scarlatti. Then Joan
walked swiftly on. Her frock of gera-
nium-red velvet flowed into fullness from
the sides. It was cut high at the back,
and its sleeves were fitting and long be-
yond the wrists. To those who had heard
her sing before she went overseas it was
clear that Joan Hammond had cultivated
her talent for singing with unremitting
care. All the “tions” (vocalisation, enun-
ciation and pronunciation) are about
perfect. Her Italian is as smooth on the
ear as mellow golden wine on the palate.
And three cheers for Joan, who has
taken as much pains over her English
diction as over the foreign tongues. Who
can forget her singing of Purcell’s “When
I Am Laid, Am Laid In Earth”?
MRS. C. P. JOHNSON, of Edge-
cliff, recently appointed president of
the Y.W.C.A.
(Norton Trevaire photograph.)
Leonard Long came to town last week
from Nowra. He was up for the open-
ing of his show in the Grosvenor Gal-
leries, which was filled with sunlight and
spring flowers for the occasion. There
are 31 paintings in this exhibition, and
if you have ever ridden along the bush
roads about Mhtagong you will feel
yourself back in that country of soft-
blue distances and sparkling mornings.
An early buyer was the Reverend Dr.
Toomey, who had christened the artist.
He came to scan, but remained to pay.
Vacuumed and polished under the un-
relenting eye of Brigadier Holland, the
rooms of the United Services Institution
positively glittered last Friday evening.
It was the setting for the first since-the-
war party, and the cocktails that started
a sedate round at five-thirty were doing
an iridescent razzle-dazzle (or so it
seemed) by seven forty-five, when
guests began to remember they had
homes to go to. Colonel Spain, twice a
former president, as shown by the newly-
unveiled board, was on deck and wel-
coming arrivals from the drop of the
handkerchief. Rear-Admiral G. D.
Moore, this year’s president, and Mrs.
Moore were early arrivals, and it was
Mrs. Moore who unveiled the board
carrying the list of former presidents.
She did this with neatness and dispatch
and without any flurry of words, proving
herself a true first mate of the Silent
Service
The rooms on the top of History
House have historic as well as pleasant
atmosphere. All the furniture was once
in the first H.M.A.S. Australia, and in the
tall cases lining the walls there are
books of reference on all matters con-
nected with the three services. On Friday
the rooms fairly sizzled with brigadiers,
majors, colonels, captains, air chiefs,
admirals. There were the Herron
couple, with Mrs. Edgley, and Mrs.
Russell; there were Major Galleghan
and the Brigadier Herring couple.
Captain Newcombe, Group-Captain Ellis
and Mrs. Ellis, the Percy Spenders,
Colonel John Prentiss, Captain Keith
Morris and Mrs. Morris, Mrs. Holland,
and lots of other cheery and highly deco-
rated and decorative people.

From Melbourne
A mood of gaiety pervaded the Comedy
for the return Elliott-Ritchard season.
The Norman Hartnell creations worn by
Madge in “Shadow Play” raised many a
sigh from the feminine hearts in the
audience. In a box were General E.
Sebree, U.S, military attache, and Mrs.
Sebree, she in a gown of old-gold crepe
with a full bouffant skirt and covered
by a mink coat. With them were the
Norman Brookes pair—the lady wore
ice-blue crepe and silver-fox coat.
Daughter Cynthia was with husband
knight Gengoult Smith. Some new color
alliances were noted. To her crystal-
beaded ice-blue gown Hilda Corbett
added long suede gloves in cyclamen
tones, which matched her shoes. Iris
Vincent Smith trailed draperies of brown
net embroidered in many flower tones.
Something new, too, was the gold-
studded red tunic that Dulcie Fraser
wore with her black skirt. Another tunic,
beige wool crepe embroidered in jet-
flower design, was worn by Ethel King,
with a long slit black skirt.
Bob Menzies, relaxing from the hust-
ings, was there with his wife, who wore
a black dinner suit of wool crepe. The
perfume of flowers also was in the mood,
for women had pinned them in hair, on
bags and in their gowns. Three pink
tulips were pinned in the full-length
mink coat worn by Mrs. Olive Thring.
Very lovely was the white ermine bolero,
with its short white fox sleeves, worn by
Mrs, A. Silk ; her ice-blue, beaded frock
was a delightful contrast. Mrs. Fred
Dennett wore flame-colored georgette
under her ermine coat. Her daughter,
Sue Cecil, soon off to England with her
babies, was also there, Pat Hoogveld
covered her maize-toned crepe, gold-
embroidered dinner gown with a black
and gold brocade evening coat.
Pictured here by Broothorn is Mrs.
Rex Potter, known better to many
thousands of radio listeners as “Theatre-
goer.” Long association with the Firm
has sent her into every State, travelling
\vith such celebrities as Marjorie
Lawrence and Gladys Moncrieff and with
ballet and Gilsullivan companies. This
energetic young woman once ran her
own advertising agency. Probably no-
body knows better how to do descriptive
work —it was Lelie Potter who gave the
sparkling running commentary on the
arrival of the many celebrities in the
foyer of the Comedy for the Madge
Elliott-Cyril Ritchard premiere. Outside
theatrical affairs, Lelie’s chief interest
lies in the concoction of new dishes in
the kitchen.
The Press reception given at the Hotel
Windsor for Madge Elliott and Cyril
Ritchard threatened to develop into a
Mad Hatter’s Tea Party, what with en-
thusiastic photographers capering around
the guests of honor and flash bulbs pop-
ping off at intervals, but it gradually
settled down to quite a sane affair.
Madge wore a delightful green frock
under a soft golden seal fur coat, with a
small off-the-face brown-felt hat trimmed
with ruchings of matching velvet and
matched with a small eye veil. Firm in
her demand for tea, she said she pre-
ferred it to drinks. A small pageboy was
seen staggering in every few minutes to
their suite burdened with floral tributes.
Viola Tait, accompanied by husband
Frank, came to the party after her per-
formance in “The Dancing Years” ; her
high-crowned black hat was worn with
a smart black frock and grey squirrel
coat. Edgar, Cyril’s brother, was there.
He had recently arrived from England,
where he has been creating stage decor
and costumes. He plans at least two years
here, concentrating on portrait work.
Roger Barry was kept busy greeting old
friends. Petite Sydney actress Joan Lord,
Dorothy Dunkley, Bettine Welch and
Sheila Helpman greeted the famous
couple.
St. John’s, Toorak, was lavish with
white flowers for the marriage of Ruth
Colman, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
G. S. Colman, Gordon Grove, South
Yarra, and Henry Baynton Gullett, M.C.,
M.H.R. for Henty. The bride was given
away by her father; the Bishop of Gee-
long, Rt. Rev. David McKie, officiated.
Ruth made a charming picture in pearl-
cream satin, the skirt featuring a slight
train falling gracefully at the back. Pearl
embroidery, in a design of small leaves,
decorated the short-sleeved bodice and
the front of the skirt; her long tulle veil
was caught to the hair by a coronet of
orange blossoms. Her bouquet was of
gardenias and hyacinths. There were
four bridesmaids; Felicity Harrison,
Sandra Baillieu, Dian Bell (a cousin from
Brisbane) and Valerie Clarke. Pale-pink
tulle fashioned their frocks, which had
bands of lace let into the skirts. Wreaths
of cream hyacinth worn in their hair
matched the flowers they carried. Tim
Reilly, of Geelong, was best man, and
Flying-Officer Guildford JBell and Cap-
tain Robert Southey were groomsmen.
After the ceremony a reception was held
at the home of Mr. and Mfs. Colman;
the bridegroom’s mother assisted in re-
ceiving guests. Honeymoon will be
short, for the bridegroom is in the thick
of the election campaign.
The Ministering Children’s League
maintains two cottages by the sea for
children of ex-servicemen and children
from industrial suburbs who are recupera-
ting from illness. To raise funds for this
excellent cause a successful sale of gifts
was held at Glen’s Music Warehouse on
Collins-street. President of the League,
Mrs. Walter Carnegie, and Lady McPher-
son were co-organisers, and members of
the 20 branches of the League supplied
most of the articles which stocked the
shop and also helped sell them. Aprons,
dirndls and children’s clothes, all coupon-
free, found ready buyers. Gifts which
included old silver, crystal, jewellery,
hand-made gloves, toys, jams and pre-
serves were snapped up.
Crosbie Morrison, in opening the ex-
hibition of paintings at George’s Gallery
by John Farmer, spoke of the artist as
“having looked into the face of Nature
and given to those who view his works
a time of forgetting the sordid, unlovely
and chaotic state of the world today.”
Mrs. Farmer’s presentation bouquet was
of daffodils and other spring flowers.
Mrs. Max Meldrum was also there to
wish the best of luck to her husband’s
former pupil.
The Press gathering at the Oriental to
meet French tenor Georges Thill was es-
tablished on a sort of trilingual basis. The
tenor spoke in French and German ; so
did some of the guests, although halt-
ingly ; but despite the difficulties every-
one got along famously. There to greet
Georges was Jessie Brownlee, sister of
Australia’s baritone John, who is an old
friend of the tenor. Thill’s Australian
tour will be a hectic, lightning affair. He
goes on to Maoriland, thence to Mexico
and South America, returning to France
via the U.S.A.
Scotch College Chapel was the scene
of a pretty wedding when Edith Marie,
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs, Erik
Gunnersen, of Balwyn, exchanged vows
with Leith Kennedy, son of Mr. and Mrs.
Leith Crow, of Avenue Athol, Canter-
bury. The bride wore a picturesque
frock of white moire taffeta, with a tulle
veil held in place with gardenias. The
same flowers formed the trail, falling
from her prayer book. Bridesmaids
Phillis Silvers and Pamela Henry were
frocked alike in pastel tones, and John
Crow was his cousin’s bestman and
Kenneth Mcßriar groomsman. Recep-
tion was held later at the Grosvenor,
Toorak, where, with the bride’s parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Leith Crow received the
guests. Mrs. Gunnersen wore a black
frock with a beige yoke. Mrs. Leith
Crow also chose black, with burnished
sequins to highlight it.
An exhibition of rare Chinese art is
housed at the Myer Gallery, and all pro-
ceeds from the sale of catalogues is for
the Children’s Hospital. The exhibition
was under vice-regal patronage. The
State C.J.’s wife opened it and then
thanked Mrs. Garnet Malley for
lending the paintings and costumes, Miss
Ethel Spowers for organising the exhibi-
tion, and the Myer management for plac-
ing the Gallery at the disposal of the
committee. Sydneysider Mrs. Charles
Lloyd Jones, who came over for the
Gullett-Colman wedding, wore a short
sable coat with a burnt-orange-toned
ensemble and a small hat with gold trim-
mings.
The paintings were collected by Mrs.
Garnet Malley between 1930 and 1940
when her husband, Group Captain
Malley, was on Chiang Kai-shek’s staff
as air staff adviser. There are several
wonderful pictures of Buddha —one is
painted on parchment 500 years old—
and the gallery is hung with many purely
decorative Good Luck scrolls. Three of
the pictures in the exhibition are painted
on K’o ssu silk, the most prized of all
Chinese.silken weaves. It dates from the
T’ang Dynasty 1200 years ago, but only
in the last 1000 years has it been used
as a canvas for paintings. Some of the
magnificent 200-year-old Manchu robes
feature the K’o ssu silken weave.

To secure the greatest benefit
with the least trouble in the
administration of an estate is an
achievement within the reach of
all, irrespective of the size or
nature of the estate or the
domestic difficulties involved.
With the growing pr&sure of their own

culties of war-time conditions, the task
confronting the private executor has
been enormously increased.

reinforced by that of directors who are
all men of mature experience, and who
bring a balanced judgment to bear upon
the problems of estates committed to

After the elections the country will again
face a situation in which the problem of
national productivity, on a durable basis,
will still overshadow every other. We
are a nation of producers with an ever-
increasing overhead of social charges,
and expanding realm of doubtful experi-
mentation in State control. With these
expensive commitments, we shall have to
face competition from world markets,
once the immediate famine for goods
has abated. Thus far, official action has
showed little vision beyond application of
a prefabricated political plan, and blind
hope of increased production. Official
“planners” have been so intent upon
amenities that they have had no room
for ideas about production, and the in-
centives necessary to stimulate it, includ-
ing reduction of co. taxation. The one
thing industry wants just now is a chance
to develop, untrammelled by needless in-
dustrial hold-ups and official inhibitions
and restrictions.
The banks have been brought within
the framework of official control by legis-
lation designed to direct the volume and
nature of capital and other expenditure.
The idea is that investment, interest-rates,
taxes and a lot of other things are to be
so arranged by officialdom that trade and
industry will always have jobs for
workers and materials for them to work
on. The nation would have been happier
had it been given a plan with reasonable
prospects of ensuring adequate and con-
tinuous supplies of coal and other essen-
tials. Owing to lack of these supplies,
our main manufacturing industries are
unable to fill orders on hand, or to em-
bark on expansion on the scale that
national interest demands. The banks
are ready and able to play their part, and
never were they better equipped for the
purpose.
Most welcome sign in current banking
statistics is the up-turn in advances —
chief earning asset. It marks the begin-
ning of the transition period so far as
the banks are concerned. Here are the
C.B.A.’s balance-sheet figures:
1941. 1945. 1946.
Notes.. .. £6,184 £6,174 £6,174

Last term advances increased by
£3,054,150; but they were only 33.6 p.c.
of deposits as against 81,6 p.c. in 1939.
The continued growth of deposits (up
£9,539,159) reflects still heavy spending
by the Government. Liquids (up
£6,510,611) include a special account with
the Commonwealth Bank of £30,498,000,
easily the largest single item among the
co.’s assets. Add to this Commonwealth
Government securities (£6,899,816) and
Treasury bills (£4,500,000) and you get a
total of £41,897,816 —equal to 53.7 p.c.
of deposits, or 49.5 p.c. of total assets
which the co. has made available to the
Federal Government. The trend is note-
worthy by reason of its association with
official policy.
What of the future? Industry has at
its command large amounts of cash and
Government securities —which it might
prefer to sell before it borrows —thus re-
ducing the extent of its immediate depen-
dence on the banks. At the moment, the
sluggishness of recovery is also tending
to damp-down demand for financial
accommodation. On the other hand, the
rise in costs means that the financing of
current turnover and transitional outlay,
will involve much greater amounts than
pre-war. Still, it is difficult to escape the
conclusion that, for some time at any
rate, the banks will find themselves de-
pendent to a substantial degree upon the
investment basket for their eggs.
The improvement of £9762 in last
term’s net earnings was due mainly to the
growth in advances. The £262,185 of
profit was enough to pay the pref. div.
(£84,694) and show 8.8 p.c. on the
£2,000,000 of ord. capital. On share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves com-
bined) the net result was only 4 p.c. The
div., which was lifted from 7.1 p.c. to
1\ p.c., is worth only half the declared
rate on all but a small fraction of the
ord. capital. That is because the shares
w'ere issued at a premium of 100 p.c.
At 20s. the f,-p. 10s. ords. yield
3.7 p.c. on a p.c. div. basis. The f.-p.
£lO prefs. at £lO 2s. return 3.9 p.c.

The investor who bought 100 G. and G.
£1 ords. at 31s. 6d. in the dark
days of 1942 and still holds them
got a return of 11.9 pic. on his
money last term, and the shares
which cost him £157 10s. are now worth
£3OB 15s. at the present ceiling price of
61s, 9d. each. He can thus see a capital
profit of £l5l ss. (96 p.c.) if he cares to
take it. The return to a buyer at the
current ceiling price is 6 p.c, on the basis
of last term’s distribution (18* p.c.),
which includes 1£ p.c. victory bonus, or
5.6 p.c. on a 17? p.c. div. basis. The
prefs., which carry a fixed cumulative
8 p.c,, but have no other rights, seldom
come on to the market. Net tangible
cover (book value) is 295. 9d. per share.
The co. has made an extraordinarily
good showing over the last seven troubled
years. It is well-entrenched (established
over 90 years ago) throughout Australia
and Maoriland in the wholesale news-
agency and advertising business, and im-
ports a lot of British and American books
and periodicals, and does a considerable
turnover in newsprint, stationery and
fancygoods as well. Although war sub-
stantially reduced imports of paper,
books, periodicals, etc., it. also stimulated
demand for reading matter, thus widen-
ing the market for local publications, in-
cluding juvenile books and periodicals.
So, despite war-time difficulties, the co,
picked up more on the swings than it lost
on the roundabouts.
Gross earnings, in whose advance there
has been no falter, have more than
doubled since 1939. But the rise in costs
generally, including taxation, swallowed
most of the gain, as the following com-
parison of p. and 1. figures shows: —-
1939. 1942. 1945. 1946.
Gross .. £167,502 £243,584 £351,107 £357 428

Net .. £94,827 £84,225 £106,031 £106,271
Exes, took all but £240 of the improve-
ment (£6321) in last term’s gross earn-
ings. The net result covered the pref. div.
and 19.6 p.c, on the half-million of ord.
capital, compared with 19.6, 18.9, 14.3,
15.2, 15.6, 16.9, 17.3 and 18.3 p.c. back
to 1938. Average distribution over the
last half-dozen years was 15.3 p.c., as
against an average of 12.6 p.c. for the
preceding quinquennium.
Immediate prospects favor maintenance
of a high level of turnover. A bit more
paper has become available, partly
through reduction of Government con-
sumption, thus enabling publishers here
and overseas to increase the size and,
quantity of journals and magazines. And
demand continues to run-ahead of supply,
with the result that almost any publica-
tion will sell today. In the less immediate
future the public is likely to become more
discriminating in its purchases, because
(1) it mightn’t have so much loose cash
in its pocket, and (2) its purchases are
likely to cost more, owing to continued
rise in cost of printing, binding and dis-
tribution. Still, the co. appears to be
well-equipped to earn satisfactory profits
—the div. never dropped below 8 p.c.
during slump in the early 1930’5.

Last term’s growth of £110,584 in book
debts and of £6033 in stocks reflects the
still buoyant market for paper, periodi-
cals and fancy goods, etc. Including the
tax reserve —well in excess of any likely
requirements for the purpose—with lia-
bilities, the year’s improvement in the
more or less liquid surplus (£725,245) was
£12,821. New warehouses are to be
built at Perth (W.A.) and Auckland
(M.L.) as soon as men and materials be-
come available. And the strong holding
of cash, etc., suggests that the board will
have little difficulty in meeting the outlay.

Although war brought private building
activities and civil works almost to a
standstill, production of cement in Aus-
tralia quickened a little during the first
three years of the campaign. This was
dhe to the large substitute demand that
sprang up for defence requirements in
Australia and the near-by islands. Here
are aggregate production figures for the
Commonwealth over the last seven years:

1944- .. 694,163 2,364,604 3 8 1
A feature of the figures is the stability of
the cost of cement at a time when the
price of other building materials hc.s risen
steeply. Demand on defence account
passed its peak about three years back,
and production eased a little. Selling
prices are controlled by the Government,
and with taxation at a high level, and
wage, coal, paper-bag, transport and other
costs ascending, the co.’s net earnings
eased. The average was £96,538 for the
three years to June, 1940, as against an
average of £66,014 for the four years to
the close of last accounts, and the run of
12£ p.e. divs. was interrupted in 1943,
when the rate fell to 7.8 p.e.
Last term there was an improvement of
£1423 in the profit figure, which reached
£66,473, or 9.8 p.e. on capital. But the
board had no hesitation in lifting the
div, to 10 p.e,, thanks to the pent-up
demand for cement that awaits satisfac-
tion.
The building trade, which, more
than any other, is capable of inducing
prosperous conditions, continues to cry
out for essential materials. And no one
can say when they will be freely available,
because industrial hold-ups on the coal-
fields and elsewhere are dislocating pro-
duction and transport all along the line,
thus preventing men and women willing
and able to work from making their
proper contribution to solution of our
housing and other problems. Apart from
the disastrous results of the shortage of
cement in the housing field, there is a
heavy deferred public-authority demand
for important developmental works, and
large export orders for cement have had
to be turned down. The industry’s
capacity for production is indicated by
the fact that output of the five producing
plants in N.S.W. has never amounted to
much more than half potential capacity.
Kandos (paid capital £673,862) is finan-
cially an investment concern, being an
equal partner with Australian Cement
(paid capital £760,433) in Australian
Portland Cement (paid capital £2,000,000).
The operating co.’s two plants have a
combined capacity of 475,000 tons p.a.
The one at Kandos (N.S.W.) can turn
out 200,000 tons p.a., and the other at
Fyansford (Vic.) 275,000 tons p.a.

Gold Mines of Australia
This Melbourne-controlled exploration
and finance co., with a paid capital of
£52,219 in 2s. 6d. shares, netted £4563
(2.6 d. a share) for the year to end March
last. A loss of £962 on sale of 3550
Triton shares was charged against re-
serves. Income was mainly management
and consultant fees from Morning Star,
Victoria Gold Dredging and Mt. Coolon,
Investment interest now centres mainly in
the possibilities of three dredging areas
and a reefing prospect in Vic., and in two
possible dredging areas in the Northern
Territory —one on the Margaret and the
other on the McKinley River—now being
examined.
A new co. (details not yet announced)
is to be formed to work the Jim Crow
leases, Newstead (Vic.), jointly held with
London-controlled Gold Exploration and
Finance Co. of Aust. Some 10,500,000
c.y. have been'bored to average 2.5 gr. fine
gold, and there is a small amount of pos-
sible dredging ground upstream. Design
of the dredge is in hand, and orders have
been placed for portion of the equip-
ment.
The Guildford leases, also held jointly
with Gold Exploration and Finance,
adjoin Victoria Gold Dredging’s property
upstream on the Loddon River (Vic.).
Boring, not yet complete, suggests some
6,000,000 c.y, of approx. 2.2 gr. dirt,
similar in character to adjoining ground
downstream. Directors’ report says no-
thing about sale of this property to
Victoria Dredging, which has won satis-
factory returns from 2.2 gr. wash.
Scout boring of four leases, aggregating
4170 acres, on the Avoca River, near
Amphitheatre (Vic.), has indicated a “sub-
stantial yardage” of to 3gr, dirt.
Here the variable clay content of die wash
might prove troublesome in recoveries;
treatment tests are to be put in hand soon.
At Stawell (Vic.), where the co. holds
a prospecting licence covering most of
the old auriferous field, examination of
surface geology and of available recoids
of old workings is approaching comple-
tion. Some rich returns were won at
Stawell around the end of last century,
but little gold has been taken from the
locality over the last 30 years. Deepest
shaft on the field went to 2400 ft. on the
Magdala mine.
When the books closed debtors’ bal-
ances, cash, etc., totalled £70,534. There
was £2307 coming to outsiders. The 2s.
6d. shares are jammed at the ceiling figure
of ss, 3d. on the market.
Mt. Coolon (Q.), paid capital £300,000
in 10s. shares, netted £14,837 for the 12
months of 1944, and paid a 6d. div.
(£15,000), making total distribution to
date 14s. 6d. per share (£435,000). The
previous div. (6d. a share) went out in
Sept,, 1945. Coolon was a good mine
while it lasted, but the ore-body failed
to live below 450 ft,, and operations ceased
in Feb., 1939. Earnings now come from
the co.’s holding (102,100 4s. shares) in
Morning Star, which paid 6d. a share
in March last. The co. is nibbling at an
option (particulars undisclosed) which it
has neither the staff nor equipment to in-
vestigate. It has therefore entered into
an agreement with Gold Mines of Aus-
tralia to do the work for it, and to in-
vestigate anything else that comes along
within the next five years. Coolon is to
assign all its rights in any property offered
to it to G.M.A., which will carry out pre-
liminary investigation, and bear all exes,
up to £5OOO. Thereafter Coolon has the
option of paying up to one-third of any
extra cost of investigation and develop-
ment, and to share proportionately in
proceeds from working or sale of the
property. Coolon’s shares fetch 45., or
thereabouts, in the market.
* ♦ ♦ *
Having depleted available stopes and
treated the ore, Ora Banda Amalgamated,
Grant’s Patch (W.A.), closed down to-
ward the end of 1943, and the mine re-
mained on a maintenance basis, under
Government grant, until end 1945. Since
then the co. has spent over £lO,OOO of its
own cash on preliminary rehabilitation
work, during which about 600 tons oxi-
dised ore was salvaged from the upper
levels and put through the public battery
for a return of slightly over 20dwt. a
ton. A further parcel of 350 tons of
similar grade awaits crushing. Any
further oxidised ore is to be used to
sweeten feed for the co.’s own plant, when
it starts up. This rich oxidised stuff is
not representative of values in the sul-
phides, which constitute the main ore
bodies. The Federal Government has
now granted the co. a £20,000 loan at
bank interest C4* p.c.) for the purpose
of developing the lower levels. If the
work (which includes deepening of Mc-
Kenzie’s and Nicholson’s shafts and driv-
ing, etc., and which is expected to pay for
itself) comes up to “a profit-
able future should be assured to the c 0.,”
the manager says. No directors’ fees or
divs. are to be paid during the currency
of the loan, which is to be redeemed by
payments equal* to 10 p.c. of gross value
of mine production, leaving 90 p.c. for
expenditure on development, etc. Further
details are to be given at the annual roll-
up, to be held at an early date. For 20
weeks to June 15, 1943, the co. treated
6420 tons ore for 1599 fine oz. gold, an
average of approx. sdwt. The f.-p. ss.
shares, which had dropped to 2s. 2d. in
the market early this year, recently
fetched 4s.

Renewed American interest in oil ex-
ploration in Maoriland is responsible for
the revival of the market in Taranaki Oil
Field’s shares. The scrip (paid to
245. 7d.), which sold in Melbourne at
3d. about three months ago, recently
fetched 3s. 3d. in the Dominion. It was
announced in July that a party of 31
Americans, including geologists, would
arrive at Greymouth, on the west coast
of the South Island, late in August and
would spend several weeks investigating.
It was in this locality that the Superior
Oil Co, carried out drilling during the
war years, until its plant was wanted
overseas. In May two U.S. Army officers,
experts in oil boring, visited the scene
of the co.’s former activities.

“Jukes”: First Hit was unlucky in
abandoning its option over the Boom-
erang at Burtville. Six inches further on
from where First Hit finished Jack Cable,
one of the owners, broke into a fair-
sized leader, assaying 160 oz. a ton. The
option holders spent nearly £lO,OOO before
abandoning the show. As a small make-
weight on the other side of the ledger,
a party of tributers on the original First
Hit have opened up a good make of
ounce ore, and it is probable that, when
the tribute expires this month, the co.
will resume operations on its old show.
So far the tributers have crushed 251
tons for 2610 z. by amalgamation.

SUNDRY SHOWS
HAMMOND AND GOOSSENS
As soon as Joan Hammond had sung
her opening numbers by Gluck and Mon-
teverde at Sydney Town Hall on Wednes-
day night it was apparent that her voice
has greatly developed in flexibility.
One of the most successful of her
numbers was the “Canzonetta” of Haydn
—a gem of a song in which the air is sung
against a lilting accompaniment. Of
some beautiful Brahms songs, “Die
Mainacht,” in which the undercurrents
of sadness were given full play, was the
most notable. Purcell’s “When I Am
Laid” was a lament that came straight
from the heart. Raymond Lambert ac-
companied and gave a glimpse of his own
form in a Scarlatti work.
On Friday night Miss Hammond ap-
peared with the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra under Eugene Goossens’s
baton. She sang two operatic arias:
“Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster,” from
Weber’s “Oberon” and the “Dich, Theure
Halle” from “Tannhauser.” There were
fine passages of pure lyricism in the first,
and the Wagnerian air was sung with life
and authority.
The orchestra played Vaughan Wil-
liams’s “A London Symphony,” one of
the best major works by any modern
English composer over the last 40 years.
It ends, as it begins, with the tranquillity
of the Thames, and throughout its four
movements there is a wealth of contra-
puntal ingenuity. No easy work to con-
duct, but Mr. Goossens made it seem easy.
The work of the violas which the sym-
phony emphasises was very pleasing.
Richard Strauss’s “Don Juan” was full
of gaiety and elegance, but it was in the

John Antill, an A.B.C. man, had part
of his ballet suite, “Corroboree,” played
by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra,
under the Goossens baton, at Sydney
Town Hall on Sunday. A spirited piece
of music, racy of the soil, it delighted a
packed audience, and conductor and com-
poser were given a rousing reception.

Melbourne’s musical interest has
shifted to the Assembly Hall, where Ross
Pratt has been playing. A versatile
pianist, he was as much at home amongst
the early masters like John Bull, Car-
bonelli and Scarlatti as with Ravel,
Medtner and Chopin. He gave a dazzling
rendering of the difficult Brahms Varia-
tions on a Theme by Paganini.

The University Conservatorium looked
like a hotbed of future virtuosi at its mid-
winter concerto concert, conducted by
John Bishop. There was enthusiasm, as
well as a touch of roughness, in Alison
Linden’s playing of the Mozart D Minor
Concerto, and Leonard Dommett showed
that he has talent as orchestral leader.
* * * *
The concert of the new St. Kilda
Municipal Orchestra at the Assembly
Hall was unique in two respects. It was
the first time the first suburban orchestra
had played under metropolitan auspices,
and it was the first time music was made
on instruments made by one of the
musicians. The first and second violins,
the viola and ’cello were all the handi-
work of Nelson Oliver, the viola player.
Tumblers and Clowns.
“Clambake” opened at Sydney Tiv.
with a shimmer of costumes, flashing of
blades and a fine flashing of limber legs,
all belonging to the Epee Ballet.
Elimar, Prince of Jugglers, gives a very
dazzle of dexterity, as does an agile little
man who pedals and balances on a bi-
cycle, one wheel of a bicycle, and then
on odd, unconnected parts of the
machine. There are a ventriloquist, voca-
lists, a dog with a bored bark and a skit
on Hollywood which is really funny.
There are the six flying De Pauls,
tumbling faster and faster, swift and
graceful as flying fish—if it is possible to
visualise flying fish coiling themselves
into six silver circles and rotating rapidly
across the Tiv, stage.
There are, in fact, all the usual in-
gredients of a good Tiv. show, all pre-
sented in the Tiv.’s customary colorful
manner music, ballet and marvels;
burlesque, beauty, and Billy Blinkhorn,
with a yodelling ballad about Ned Kelly
stealing horses and gold, I-d-ee, and rob-
bing the bank at Jerr-ill-de-ree, Or
words to that affect.
The appeal of Tiv. shows is mainly in
their variety, but the best acts are
generally those like the De Pauls, Elimar,
and the “Bloke on the Bike.” Man has
loved tumblers, jugglers and conjurers
for as long as he has split his collective
sides laughing at clowns. And in show-
ing man his ridiculous self, clowns have
doubtless served a high moral purpose.
“Mo” is a clown in this ancient and
honorable sense, and of the “Clambake”
comedians George Wallace Jnr. seems
most likely to follow —though at a
respectable distance —in his footsteps, ex-
tracting full flavor from ancient jests, not
so much by improvisation as by vitality
and gusto. And as long as the Tiv. serves
up tumblers and clowns —with a right
leavening of music and femininity—it’s
pretty certain to need its “House Full”
sign every night,

There was as much need for Charles
Ceilings to detach himself from the scenes
of James Bridie’s “The Black Eye” and
come before the curtain with comment
and explanation as there was for a tap
dancer to punctuate the acts. The play, a
lightly amusing comedy, was put on by
the Sydney Players Club at the Kuring-
gai Theatre Guild’s diggings at Killara
Hall, and there was nothing obscure
about the motives and actions of the
characters —a Glasgow family rescued
from the verge of bankruptcy by the irre-
sponsible actions of its own aimless and
dissolute black sheep. Collings, as the
wayward young man whose incredible
luck saves the family fortunes, maintained
the illusion of amiable inebriation
through most of the piece, but “drunks”
are easy to play and he showed more
acting ability in the character’s brief
periods of sobriety. The same applied to
Edward Jackson as the gentle grafter who
shows Collings the way to easy money.
Trixie Gore and F. Stewart Jarbo were
the parents of the tottering family, and
Douglas Murray, Frances Barclay and
Marcia Jarbo the rest of it; they were
credible and competent. Vivienne Jarbo
looked, and acted, the part of the pretty
young socialite unable to decide which
male member of the family she wants,
and C. W, Jackson broadcast a Scottish ac
cent thick enough to blunt a circular saw.
Chinese Paintings.
The best bit of unconscious humor at
the exhibition of Chinese paintings at the
Myer Gallery, Melbourne, is the huge
“portrait” of the God of Officialdom, a
stout, complacent gentleman named Lu
Hsing, who is carrying the Ju-i sceptre.
The Ju-i sceptre is a symbol for immor-
tality, and if there is anybody more im-
mortal than an official it would be diffi-
cult to find him. Most pf the pictures
don’t belong to the great tradition, but
look as if they were painted on com-
mission—portraits of husbands and wives
and civil servants painted with meticulous
precision and garbed in robes which look
amazingly like the material represented.
There are quaint studies of palace scenes
with children playing, and of ladies riding
horses over snow-capped mountains. The
effect produced is as primitive and un-
sophisticated as the medium the Chinese
artists used, not having discovered the
more complex techniques of. Europe. The
Celestial painter never achieves the effects
of the great artists of the Renaissance,
but local modernism is almost certain to
be in for a spate of “Chinese” painting
as a result of this exhibition.

There is a quality of freshness about
John Farmer’s landscapes and still life at
George’s Gallery, Melbourne, which
comes from direct observation. Trained in
impressionistic methods, he confines him-
self to a few tones and colors, but within
their range achieves an interesting variety.
“Olinda Falls Road,” “A Glimpse of
Silvan” and “Sunshine Between Showers”
are very pleasant landscapes. There is
a similar freshness about the still life and
the same economy of means.
At the Talkies.
There may not be anything very funny
in Mr. Costello’s confession, “I’m afraid
of oysters—are there any in this soup?”
nor in Mr. Abbott’s reply “Who ever
heard of oysters in oyster soup?” But
when Mr. Costello attempts to dunk a
biscuit in the broth and a ferocious
bivalve breaks the surface, snaps it fronj
his fingers and submerges, the situation is
both unexpected and very funny. It is
all the funnier because of Mr. Costello’s
silent, terror-stricken acceptance of the
presence of a live, hungry oyster in his
soup as normal. After trying to lure it
out with a couple more biscuits, he
attacks it with a knife and, that failing,
attaches a bent pin to his tie, baits it with
a crust of bread and fishes for the thing.
The result is disastrous.
The scene, from “Here Come the Co-
Eds,” at Sydney Capitol, is a perfect piece
of clowning, and clowning of the purest
kind in that it is played in complete
silence. Costello is a genuine clown and
a good one, and his antics as a member
of a women’s basketball team or as the
opponent of a man-eating wrestler are
almost as funny as his trouble with the
soup. #The story in which these doings
are set concerns a girls’ college which
pays off the mortgage and ensures its
continued existence by staging a concert
of swing music and betting the takings
on an inter-college basketball match.
And that’s such an old one that its re-
peated use is almost as amusing as the
live oyster in Mr. Costello’s soup.

“Cluny Brown” (Century) is a light
comedy of a maid with an aptitude for
plumbing and a refugee Czech professor
with an accommodating philosophy and
an aptitude for borrowing money, both
of whom shatter, the customary calm of a

Boyer and Jennifer Jones keep it moving.

In their chase after the market, English
film producers are turning to the same
sentimental magazine fiction as Holly-
wood, and, though it’s presented and acted
with more restraint, it’s still the same
stuff. “Love Story” (Embassy) is a fair
average sample of the English product.
Stewart Grainger is the troubled young
man who won’t explain why he isn’t m
uniform; Margaret Lockwood the con-
cert pianiste with an uncertain future;
and Tom Walls the benign and selt-
appointed guardian with a wide Yorkshire
accent. The Cornish setting is good.

A reckless outbreak of technicolor at
Sydney State records “A Night In Para-
dise,” in which Turhan Bey figures some
of the time as a bewhiskered and cnppleu
/Esop in the court of Croesus, and for me
rest of the time as a scented young man
dallying with Merle Oberon. It has the
flavor and color of a boiled lolly and
seems to last as long.

RED MILL RUM.
Russia’s visit to Brisbane was uncommonly
successful. Racing on two Saturdays and the
intervening Wednesday, Excitement’s son won a
treble, the National Plate (w.f.a.), Metropolitan
and Exhibition Handicaps, the first time it was
accomplished by any horse, nor had any
previous winner of the Exhibition carried 10.3.
On each occasion Russia was an odds-on favor-
ite. In the Exhibition it was 5 to 2 on Munro s
mount, sto 2 Falcon Knight. Russia gave
Falcon Knight 131 b. and beat him by a length
and a half, cutting out the mile and a quarter
in 2.3*.
Apprentice jockey Callaghan isn’t likely to
forget his first ride in a race, which was in
the Tramway Handicap at Ascot on Exhibition
Handicap day. Callaghan was on Few Words,
a rank outsider, and Few Words finished first,
but the unfortunate Callaghan weighed in light.
The race was, of course, awarded to Ascertain,
the runner-up, and loud was the outcry and
feverish the searching for torn-up tickets by
punters who had been too impatient to wait for
the correct-weight flag.

At Canterbury on Saturday ’four outright
favorites and one equal favorite were sucess-
ful, and the remaining races went to well-backed
runners; so for once the bookmakers had a
bad day. They could afford the change; and
they are sure to retrieve their losses.
The main race was the Frederick Clissold
Handicap, run over six furlongs, and worth
£lOOO in prizemoney. The field included Gay
King, last year’s winner, who was second-
favorite with Felstar; Hedui was a 9-to-4 favor-
ite. Hedui was done with at four furlongs.
Meanwhile Gay King hit the front and held the
lead till well into the straight; then Duncan
brought Petulance (5 to 1) along, and the
Andrea gelding went on to a comfortable vic-
tory, Felstar being thiid, behind Gay King.
About this time last year Petulance aad a
siring of good wins before the handicapper
found his measure. Air Flare, a former W'est-
ralian galloper having his first run in Sydney,
was noticed travelling well for a while.
Duncan made it a double with Buzz Off in
the Canterbury Handicap, 11 furlongs. Cisco
was second to Buzz Oif, and Flying Cloud was
third. All three were at 4 to 1.
Two three-year-old races gave some of the
youngsters initial experience of a little more dis-
tance than they had till then tackled. The first,
for colts and geldings, was a nine-furlongs
affair, and the Marconigram colt Royal Spirit
justified the strong support for him, running
past the judge four lengths clear of the second
horse, Locrian. Bell Rock, a brother to Turn
Again, was third. Shean, rider of Royal Spirit,
was adjudged guilty of interference, and sus-
pended for two months, which means that he
will miss the spring meetings at Randwick.
The race for fillies, furlongs, went to the
favorite, Duotetra, who accounted for Gay Fly
and Catch On,
On form, Doughnut looked to have no
chance in the Maiden Handicap, nine furlongs;
but a street-corner tip, he was always at short
odds, and he finished too well for the favorite
Royal Duke and Cherokee Lad. His name is
accounted for by his being by Double Remove-
Peanut. Doughnut gave the Melbourne jockey
McCloud his first win since coming north.
The Welter, six furlongs, was run in divisions
and favorites won each. In one, Fine Art
(Moore) downed Scotch Gift and Battle King;
in the other 9.7 failed to stop the consistent
Alderman (Fordyce), who was followed home
by Gold Caste and The Cheat.
* * * *
At .Mentone a card of eight races, with big
fields and few scratchings, proihised well for
the books and the promise was amply fulfilled.
Breasley was on the only animal that didn’t
disappoint backers of favorites —Prince Nigri
in the first division of the mile Queensborough
Handicap, and the Prince may have been lucky.
Prior to scoring on Prince Nigri, Breasley had
had a dreary sequence of losing mounts.
As a two-year-old Nestor was good enough to
dowm Don Pedro, Royal Gem and Attley in the
Sires’ Produce Stakes. In the Chesterfield
Handicap he reproduced a glimpse of that form.
Never far back, he looked the winner when he
ran past Invasion Chief entering the straight,
but still had to withstand a challenge issued
by Greensborough; he responded gamely for
Crilley and got there by a neck. Invasion
Chief hung on into third place —not a bad
effort, for it was his first run after a long spell.
An elderly mare with little to recommend her,
Judith Louise (Olsen) surprised by winning the
Ascot Thousand furlongs). She was one
of the leaders throughout. The well-backed
Gallant Gentleman just failed to overtake her
at the finish, though beating Medicine for
second money.
The Sandhurst Trial Hurdle looked a first-
class trap for punters, being contested by 17
horses whose hurdling experience ranged from
very little to nil. Few picked the winner,
Colebrook (Aldridge), who raced indifferently
in Sydney. Colebrook, who carries the colors
distinguished by Yaralla, had done a little
jumping. Lord Solar and Kursk, in the minor
places, were. of the “experience-h//” class.
A rather better result for punters was that
of the Anglesey Handicap, a mile race for four-
year-olds. Anstey (Gilmore), Rose Bay and
Lord Beaufort were most in request and
finished in that order. In other event's Pero
(Snart) defeated the favorite Reprisal, a 100-to-l
chance Forest Lad and other three-year-olds
over seven furlongs; in a 13-furlongs handicap
Miss Prim (Richards) at 12 to 1 was too good
for Vigor and Calbrae, and in the second divi-
sion of the Queensborough Handicap Lunar
Lynx (Brown) accounted for Metronome and
Encircler.

An American sports writer, commenting on
the readiness of punters to get hot under the
collar over present-time slight delays in starts,
dipped into the records and dug up a Futurity
field that took one hour 32 minutes to send on
the way; A scribe of the time reported that it
had “looked from the grandstand that the
starter had lost control of the boys,” to
which the paper’s editor added: “This is tho
understatement of the season.” But even that
delay isn’t a record. Nor is the 20 minutes
longer occupied in getting an American Derby
field on the way. No less a pillar of relia-
bility than N.Y. “Times” records a race at
Saratoga in which the starter —whose name
must have been Job —used up two hours 20
minutes making sure of a good start.

The male line of Knockdown, winner of the
Santa Anita Derby this year, includes one sire
with a name both unusual for a racehorse and
yet familiar enough—Australian, who stands
away back at the head of what is, on both
sides, one of the most American of all lines
of breeding. For many generations Knock-
down’s dams in succession have been bred in
America, beginning with Cotillion, and the male
line comes down through Australian (1858).

Over 100,000 watched the five V.F.L.
games in Melbourne on Saturday,
another 10,000 turning out at Geelong,
where the locals endured another maul-
ing at the hands and feet of Richmond
“Tigers.” This result gives the “Tigers”
a faint chance for “the four,” along with
Carlton, which team they are to meet
next Saturday in what should be the
match of the day. Footscray, thoroughly
trounced by Collingwood (20.12-10.10)
drops back into third place, with Essen-
don on top, Collingwood next and Mel-
bourne fourth, four points ahead of
Richmond and Carlton. Melbourne,
back on the M.C.G. on Saturday for the
first time since it won the 1941 premier-
ship there, belted Hawthorn by 18.15 to
13.8 as a mark of appreciation. Else-
where Essendon outclassed North Mel-
bourne 18.14-4.10, Fitzroy beat South
Melbourne 12.15-7.16, and St. Kilda,
giving its best exhibition for some time,
finished 15 points behind Carlton —14.8-

“Sturt”: Quinn, S.A.’s football cap-
tain, has published his opinion that his
State can’t hope to beat Victoria “until
it gets down to the job of making players
professionals like the Victorians.” At
present, he says, they think mainly, in
club games, of playing so as to get into
a touring side—their greatest reward. The
Victorians, who get their money just the
same each week, play “as a team,” not
as individuals. Also, a coach can
talk much straighter to a pro. team, for
with disciplinary control each man
knows that he has something to lose if
contumacious, Quinn adds the quite
unexpected opinion that in the recent
match the Adelaide men, who have
always been warned that they must stand
up to heavy bumping from Victorians,
did just that —went for the man. Their
opponents went for the ball —and got it.

in 1910 he took 12 wickets for 181, and
finished with 36 wickets at 21.75 in the
series. He toured Australia later in the
same year with the S’Africa XI, but
struck Hill, Trumper, Armstrong, Rans-
ford and Bardsley at their best, and his

The best fight of the year at Leichhardt
was provided by featherweights, Ted
Sprouster and Eric Macready. It went
the full 12 rounds and each was a limp
and weary lad at the end. Sprouster’s
busy left was held by old-timers to have
gained the balance of points for him, but
the referee, Mawson, ruled that they had
broken even.
A promising young lightweight is Roy
Treasure, who knocked out Jackie Wilson
in five rounds at the Sydney Stadium.
Treasure is a southpaw like Patrick
and wants to fight that young man
whether Patrick beats or goes under

he recently drew with Treasure,
Wilson never had a hope in the “re-
turn,” and after he had been floored
for “nine” in the third round it became
only a question of how long he could last.

forced matters from beginning to end,

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
A Man of Courage and Principle
R. G. Menzies contends that the
Federal Labor Government is falling to
pieces through sheer feebleness. He
points out that a Government must
govern; “the present Commonwealth
Government has ceased to govern, and it
should, therefore, be removed.” He
quoted the dictation by Communist water-
side workers of Australia’s foreign policy
towards the Dutch, and referred to the
marked unwillingness of the Chifley Gov-
ernment to deal with Communist
treachery in our midst.
Mr. Menzies then mentioned his own
action against a group of waterside
workers who, before the war in the
Pacific, attempted to control Australia’s
relations with Japan by refusing to load
scrap-iron. Going to Port Kembla in
person and confronting the wharfies,
Menzies told them he would bring action
against them under the Transport
Workers Act. The strike collapsed. Mr.
Chifley, with all the National Security
legislation at his disposal, is more likely
to collapse when confronted with an in-
dustrial problem. Like his immediate
predecessor, he keeps his person and mind
as far away from trouble as he can.
The sheer humbug of waterside
workers in their attitude towards the load-
ing of scrap-iron for Japan has been re-
vealed many times since in the things they
did (or didn’t do) which increased
the hardships and dangers confront-
ing Australian soldiers in their bloody
fight against the Japanese in New
Guinea and other islands. Comforts
Funds parcels were actually rifled by
wharfies. At the time Menzies insisted
on the loading at Port Kembla we were
not at war with Japan, and he seems
to have had vision enough to see that
industrial indiscipline was likely to do
greater damage to Australia than ever
could a few shipments of junk that the
Japs might buy just as readily in any
other part of the world.
Menzies, who had courage then, has
courage enough now to show his
adherence to principles which, however
unpopular they may have been in some
quarters on some occasions, have been
shown by the passing of time to be en-
tirely right. That is the kind of courage
and vision Australia sorely needs: the kind
that will risk even long-continued unpopu-
larity and larrikin abuse in order to achieve
something for the nation in the long run.
The same mob which was so pious in its
attitude towards trade with Japan is now
openly defying the laws of Australia and
attempting to bring industrial breakdown
and social revolution. Periodic “humani-
tarian” demonstrations by Communists
and their stooges are pure window-
dressing to cover their vicious attacks on
Australian democracy. Effects of their
offensive should be plain enough now
for anyone to see.
Democracy is in some ways like a fruit-
tree developed to give better fruit in a
more bountiful supply ; it has to resist
parasites and diseases that its more
primitive forebears never knew. Democ-
racy, a highly - developed method
of government that has moved for-
ward with the world’s greatest period
of industrial progress, is exposed on
many sides to the attacks of the un-
scrupulous—sections which look for op-
portunities to strike, for sectional gain,
at points where Democracy has allowed
itself to become weak. Long ago crooked
company promoters found that in the
principle of company-incorporation there
“Come, sir—you MUST remember which pocket your Wallet’s in !”
was much scope for the illegitimate as
well as the legitimate, and they “moved
in” as wreckers and opportunists into the
financial structure. Red Fascists, in their
own twisted way, see what they think is
their opportunity to “make a killing” in
democratic countries every now and then ;
they appreciate the strains to which
Democracy is periodically exposed and
they take advantage of democratic insti-
tutions to knife Democracy in the back.
Under Democracy every fool has the right
of voting as he wishes and of supporting
any revolutionary form of government
that he chooses, even if it means, in the
end, his own social destruction. The
freedom implicit in Democracy gives
freedom to Democracy’s enemies as well
as its friends. Democratic peoples must
therefore stand together and protect the
principles of Democracy, chief of which
are the rule of law and free expression
of political opinion, including the
uninhibited right to vote. Before the
recent war there was a lot of criti-
cism of the democratic system. It
mainly arose from people having no
desire to accept Democracy’s responsi-
bilities, however ready they were to accept
its benefits almost as a birthright. The
present is a time for emphasis on demo-
cratic responsibility and the need for up-
holding the rule of law.

Eddie has been warning everyone that

inflexibility of currency being insisted on
by the power§ that have noting control in
the scheme, his idea being that Australia
will be prevented from devaluing its cur-
rency as it chose to do in the depression
years. At the moment trends are mostly
the other way. Canada and Sweden both
jumped their currencies to a higher level
in relation to the dollar when price-
control in the United States went into a
condition of suspended animation. Com-
menting on this attempt “to mark down
the dollar to bargain prices,” a “Wall-
street Journal” writer said:
The aim of these countries is to increase
the value of their own currencies in terms
of American dollars and thereby reduce the
cost of American goods they buy. This
would be the reverse of the “currency war”
of the late 1920’s and early 1930’5, when
surplus-ridden nations were devaluing their
moneys in a race for world markets for
their goods.
Most of the major trading nations today
are on the buying side of the market, com-
peting mainly for scarce and high-priced
U.S. goods. With the world’s productive
machinery thrown into chaos by the war,
America is the only important source of
many products.
A number of countries, including Great
Britain, would like to depreciate the dollar
in terms of their own currency. But off-
setting the threat to some extent is the
difficulty many of these countries would
have in backing-up-such revaluations. Even
Canada finds it necessary to continue most
of its war-time exchange restrictions.
Few members of the International Cur-
rency Fund are satisfied with the present
value of the dollar in relation with their
own money. Many, like Canada, would
like to see their own currency buy more
American dollars, and are attempting to
get as high a dollar value for their money
as they can. Fund officials hope to solve
this knotty problem in a way to achieve
an orderly foreign-exchange market and
avoid a currency war.
Eddie Ward, like so many of his col-
leagues, suffers from a depression-and-
dole complex. He is afraid of currency
stability, blaming it for financial depres-
sion. Today we live in a production de-
pression, and our great problem at the
moment is to maintain the value of our
money, not reduce it.

A gentleman named Forbes H. Brown,
of Oakland, Calif., has had a talk to “the
public-relations representative of the
Australian consulate in San Francisco,”
and has written to the local “Examiner”
about it. Says Mr. Brown, after his talk
with the public-relations officer;
Australia at present is governed by a
Labor party; they permit no strikes, and
none are found necessary in providing
living wages for all. Arbitration of all dif-
ferences is the 1aw.... •
No vast salaries are paid the presidents
of the unions as we know it here. That
position in Australia is one of honor.
Are we paying public-relations officers
to conduct a fantastic leg - pulling
campaign abroad or what? In 1945-46 it
was estimated that the Australian legation
in the U.S.A. would cost £75,500. It
would appear that information being
handed out abroad is about as reliable as
that issued by Calwell’s Department of
Information in the Commonwealth.

Maoriland Labor, with an election to
face on November 27, has announced
some tax reductions. Included in these is
the abolition of excess-profits tax, levied
at the rate of 75 p.c. of any profits in ex-
cess of pre-war “standard income.” A
maximum of Bs. Bd. in the £ was payable
on ordinary company income in N.Z.,
plus 33j p.c.; the surcharge is now re-
duced from 33| p.c. to 15 p.c. There is
no undistributed-profits tax in Maoriland
except in the case of certain proprietary
companies. Maximum tax rate in N.Z.
prior to the reductions was 15s. 6d. in
the £ both for companies and individuals.
In Australia there has been no reduction
whatever in war-time rates of company
taxation. Large sales-tax concessions are
also being made in N.Z. that have no
parallel in the Commonwealth.
* # * sp
At July 31 the Treasury-bill debt had
declined to £3lB million, which compares
with £360 million two months earlier.
This is a welcome improvement. But
it is hard to ascertain how the
reduction has been achieved. “War”
expenditure out of revenue for July
figures in the public accounts at
only £17.8 million, while there ap-
pears a credit of £6.5 million in the
loan fund on war-expenditure account.
The nature of this credit is not explained.
There is no mention of revenue from
disposals in the accounts; this may have
been offset against loan-fund expenditure,
resulting in a credit. The Government
is deliberately concealing many impor-
tant financial transactions with the object
of keeping voters uninformed until after
the elections. Its accounts for 1945-46
were deficient in necessary information,
and it vacated Parliament without pro-
ducing a Budget for the current year.
* * * *
Taxation imposed by all Governments
on Australian citizens during 1944-45
was £49 Is. a head, and in 1945-46,
though details are not yet available, the
exactions were higher. The burden in
1938-39 was £l7 19s. 6d. a head. Com-
monwealth income tax, £1 14s. 4d. before
the war, in 1944-45 was £29 7s. 2d., in-
cluding the portion refundable to the
States, and last year the average was
greater still. Commonwealth income tax
in 1944-45, excluding the State refunds,
was approximately £22 a head —about L
times greater than the pre-war levy.

to the blatant results of the Chinese and
Gothic influences of the day. Strict sym-

typified the work of the Adam brothers,
two important 18th century architects,
who still found time to fill their archi-

Housing the People
The Leader of the Government in the
Senate the other day was asked, in a
readied-up question, whether it was not
a fact that building activity was now
greater than at any time in the country’s
history. Senator Ashley replied that it
was, and left listeners to the Parliamen-
tary broadcast goggle-eyed at the impu-
dence of the bluff. Possibly Senator
Ashley, from his close Ministerial associa-
tion with the Government, has come to
regard the filling of forms and the issue
of permits as “building activity.” For
it is a fact that, so great have been the
arrears in homebuilding over the past five
years, the requests for permission to build
cottages have been more numerous since
the war ended than in any of the years
immediately preceding the conflict.
But form-filling and the issue of per-
mits do not build houses, even if rubber-
stamping, etc., has been developed into a
major Labor-Government industry. The
actual construction and completion of
brick and similar-quality dwellings in the
capital cities and suburbs are nowhere
near the rate established in the war year
1940-41, when the Menzies and Fadden
Governments were in office.
In shires and municipalities where
building covenants are not strict there
now appears to be quite a spurt in home-
construction ; but it amounts to concen-
tration in a few localities of cheaper-type
building, usually taking months to com-
plete each cottage.
In every city there are what amount
almost to unofficial clubs formed by
young married people swapping notes as
to the trouble they have had getting a
permit to build a house greater than 12
squares in size, the difficulty they have
experienced in finding a builder, and the
builder’s difficulty in getting materials.
They nearly all suffer from “in-law”
rouble caused by cramped enforced living
with either the husband’s or wife’s parents.
The inability of the Federal Govern-
ment to do much to relieve this sad posi-
tion is typical of its failure to tackle any
problem where real government is called
for. It juggles with money matters —
wages, pensions, unemployed-relief, cen-
tralised spending, central-bank control of
finance, redistribution of income through
heavy “social-service” and other taxa-
tion but it is unable to deal with any
of the real problems retarding production.
The Federal Government passed “hous-
ing control” back to the States on Nov-
ember 1, 1945, one State Premier pro-
testing that he was being handed a
Federal hot potato. But ail during the
war, and particularly during the referen-
dum period, when the Department of
Post-war Reconstruction was being adver-
tised widely, there was great talk about
what the Federal Government was doing
in the matter of housing research.
Government “planning” in the housing
matters actually hasn’t been worth a hoot.
Private enterprise, on the other hand,
has presented many new types of home-
construction. Little seems to have
been done governmentally to test the
uew systems, though one type of home-
construction at least appears to have wide
possibilities. This is the Dampney
method of building by means of pre-
cast concrete slabs and studs, the whole
building being cemented together by
mortar, with a cavity wall. The mortar —
jointing and “glueing” material —is as
strong and waterproof as the concrete.
Many of these cottages have been stand-
ing for years in Sydney and Melbourne,
and give every indication of satisfactory
service. The concrete is a chemical com-
position rather than a mechanical mix-
ture, ashes, where available, being some-
times used as aggregate material; the
result, after proper curing, is a slab
through which a nail can be driven, but
which is waterproof, strong and which
improves in strength with the passing of
the years.
A 17-room country home has recently
been built near Oberon (N.S.W.) by the
Dampney method at a very low cost,
even if allowance is made for possibly
exceptional conditions under which labor
was acquired. A cottage is also being
erected by a private contractor at Chul-
lora for the N. S. Wales Housing Com-
mission, and it will be an opportunity
lost if all housing authorities don’t keep
a close check on the construction, study-
mg the possibilities of mass, as well as
individual, construction.
Though the concrete and mortar must
bo mixed with great care, making the
slabs and building are extremely simple
processes, requiring a minimum of plant.
Mr. Dampney is endeavoring to
arrange for the construction of his type
ot homes on a national scale, asking for
me support and co-operation of shires
and municipalities, University professors
(scientists, technicians, etc.), banking in-
stitutions, life-assurance offices and
Public-minded people generally. He
asserts that housing is a major social
problem, and one to which a great deal of
political, scientific and economic thought
should be devoted. It is his idea that a
central controlling company should license
manufacturers of building slabs and
builders, charging a small licence fee to
ensure that concrete-making and build-
ing are properly supervised so as
to maintain a proper standard. With
the co-operation of scientists in test-
ing new types of constituents for
concrete, and with competent people
searching for new kinds of build-
ing materials in each part of the Com-
monwealth, it is contended that building
could be carried out in all parts of the
country in the most economical and self-
contained way. Dampney insists that
the proper making of concrete is the
job for an expert, and that research,
provided for in his organisation, would
produce stronger, lighter and more
waterproof materials that would be
almost everlasting, as Roman cement was.
It may be that the Dampney idea is a
bit too large for many people to digest,
and that some would be quite happy to
see such a housing project launched on
a more modest scale to begin with,
gathering momentum with its success. It
may also be that some will insist that
businessmen have achieved more in the
productive line than highminded national
movements not prompted by the profit
incentive. But Dampney’s idea of a
central control of price and quality is
a good one, and it would be quite in
order for one municipality to take the
project on and give it a thorough trying-
out first. Success would soon bring de-
mands from further afield, however;
hence the necessity for having a well-
planned nation-wide organisation in readi-
ness from the beginning. Previous refer-
ences to the Dampney system have
brought inquiries from as far afield as
New Zealand and South Africa.
The setting-up of an organisation hav-
ing as its objects the supply of plentiful,
cheap and adequate housing, whether of
the kind Dampney mow envisages or of
a kind to be developed by later experi-
ence, will demand a great deal of faithful
work by competent people. If there were
any faith or competence in the Federal
Government it would be on its toes help-
ing the preliminary organising now.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Bo”: Old Ned jerked his thumb
towards an ancient sulphur-crested cocka-
too that was waddling around exploring
the fireplace outside the hut, and spoke
with feeling, “Fd always looked on the
parrot tribe,” he said, “as bein’, next
to his moke an’ his dawg, among
man’s most loyal friends. Fm satisfied
since yestiddy a cocky thinks more
of helpin’ his feller-birds than he does
the bloke that supplies him with corn.
I’m lollin’ in the shade o’ that bloodwood
when one o’ them cheeky little bronze
honey-eaters hops on me shoulder an’
has a peck at one o’ the few hairs I got
left on me head—it’s after nest-buildin’
material, o’ course, I don’t bother huntin’
him away ’cause I know a tiny bird like
that couldn’t do a man no harm, an’
anyway it’s sorta nice an’ ticklin’ him
hoppin’ over me dome. Well, I musta
fell asleep, an’ later I wakes up as I feel
hair gettin’ tugged outa me chest. It’s
Joe, me cocky. He’s astride me chest;
he’s chewed the buttons orf me shirt,
torn it open, pulled a beakful of hair
out an’ dropped it beside the honeyeater,
an’ he’s sayin’, friendly-like, ‘There you
are, mate —got hair on his chest like a
doormat. Comes out easy, see? Now go
f’r y’r life! ’ ”
“Lub”: “Had a pet crow once wot
c’d sing the first two bars of ‘Annie
Lorrie’ in chune,” related Bertie the Bat.
“A real doer he was an’ alw’ys lookin’
fr fight. Useter sneak on the cat, take
a grip on its tail an’ slam his brakes
on hard while the spittin’ tom dragged
him round the yard. Finally he got game
enough t’ take on the old Australorp
rooster wot objected t’ him scarin’ the
hens with his singin’. They eyed each
other orf f’r a bit an’ the rooster hopped
up on the fence an’ crowed a challenge.
Kelly, not t’ be outdone, answers with
‘Annie Lorrie’; then they into it. There’s
a blur o’ feathers f’r a while, an’ pretty
soon the Australorp gits one of his death-
locks on the nigger an’ nearly finishes the
pore cow.” “Kelly give up singing after
that, did he?” I asked. “No, but he
never sung ‘Annie Lorrie’ again,” said
Bertie sadly. “Nowadays he sings them
mournful things like them Orstralian
cowboys moan over the wireless while
they play their guitars.”

“J. Rilston”; I suppose Binghi’s pic-
torial efforts with the baob nut as a
canvas should really be classed as en-
graving (B. 17/7/’46). In his more primi-
tive state he was pleased to employ a
sharpened bone, after the fashion of a
stylus j- the splintered leg bone of a wal-
laby for preference. Nowadays, however,
the ahist has risen to metal, a few inches
of fencing wire ground to a point. His
art, too, has improved. On the big
round nut, a gift from the Kimberleys,
that lies on my desk are not only the con-,
ventional kangaroos and emus but also
a bovine head —full face, remarkably
lifelike —and, round the corners, three
full-length corroboree dancers, all
adorned with tribal marks and the wan-
ninge, that peculiar mystical headdress,
which so much resembles a species
of indoor radio aerial. Incidentally,
the abo. engraver does not favor the
deep direct line. He gets his results by
means of a series of fine chisel strokes.

“F.L.”: Greenhide experts are few
these days, but 1 struck a craftsman the
other day. His stockwhip, halters and
harness fittings were neatly graduated and
the round plaiting ran smoothly to flat
where the occasion demanded. He swore
the art was simple, but insisted that the
hide should come from a white bullock, in
fat condition and freshly-killed.

“Alpine Willie”: “Mug Angler” (B.
24/7/’46) evidently doesn’t know his
trout, “educated” or otherwise, unless he
alludes to the overland variety. Those
decorated with fins are caught mostly on
small, plump grasshoppers in this Vic-
torian locality, and the favorite hook is
a short-shanked No. 6. Baiting is done
by threading a ’hopper on head first and
bringing the fine point and barb out the
tail; otherwise the ’hopper’s tough skin
might deflect the strike. The trout, unless
scared off by a glimpse of the cast or un-
natural performance of the bait, sucks*
the ’hopper back to its gills, and a flick
“It’s them Lascars messin' about
with their Indian rope trick again.”
of the pliable cane rod tautens the line
and sets the hook. Odd fish may shy
off 'on being prematurely struck or
pricked by a hook, but the expert times
the strike to a nicety and just the right
turn of the wrist. The “educated” ones,
having been missed on one or more occa-
sions, get to be big blokes which lie on
the bottom and ignore the whole proceed-
ings. They appear to be able to spot the
artificial presentation with ease. Those
occasionally got in the net by accident or
some rare form of deception are usually
hungry enough to bite at anything. A
point, too, is that their education is ad-
vanced by numerous enthusiastic anglers
who, half-way through the season, have
marked down all the pools in a stream
where the bull trout lie.
* * ♦ ♦
“Bogaduck”: Saline areas form in two
ways (B. 12/6/’46). Some are due to the
“cyclic salt” which is dried out of /Sea
spray by the wind and carried to the
farthest inland portions of the globe in
the form of ultra-microscopic grains.
Every raindrop forms with one of those
tiny salt-grains as its nucleus, or around
one of the equally tiny grains of sulphur
thrown out by volcanoes. That is why
rain-water isn’t quite pure; every 100
tons or so of it brings down with it a
pound or two of salt. In areas of heavy
rainfall this salt isn’t noticeable. In
arid regions the high evaporation, plus
the transpiration of the roots of vegeta-
tion, soon uses up the water after rain but
leaves the salt behind; over the ages
this results in huge accumulations of salt.
In the other case, when the sea-floor rises
over big areas of shallow sea, the land
which thus emerges has very little natural
drainage, and if the rainfall is sparse the
original sea-salt remains in big beds in
the subsoil. Fresh-water supplies in
these saline areas often depend, upon the
curious fact that fresh water will float
for ever on top of brine in an aquifer-like
sand, gravel or porous rock without mix-
ing, like cream on a pan of milk. Some-
times it is in a thin sheet over the entire
layer of brine and at others it lies in
streaks across it. On Eyre Peninsula
(S.A.) a whole town and district is watered
by sucking off this thin layer of fresh
water which floats above a dense layer
of brine.

“G. Two”: “Notaden” (B. 17/7/’46)
wouldn’t be so eager to uphold the virtues
of the crow if he were growing pine-
apples or maize for a living. Besides
eating pineapples they play havoc in a
maize crop by ripping the husk off nearly
every cob to taste the ripening grain,
thus ruining it by exposure to the weather.
“J. Dale”; Intelligent roosters, is it (B.
7/8/’46)? When I got some new hens
my rooster eyed them impassively and
went calmly on with his own business.
Presently it became obvious that the new-
comers were puzzled by the laying-boxes,
which were a trifle too high. His Excel-
lency watched their puzzlement for a
while; then he hopped up on the ledge,
and addressed certain remarks to them.
One by one they hopped up and settled
in to do their duty. His Ex. looked
round, closed his left eye knowingly and
returned to the ground, satisfied that his
household was in order.
“Get”: Rufus, our big Rhode Island
Red rooster, had knocked the stuffing out
of a young Leghorn cockerel which had
challenged his authority. Shortly after-
wards I returned from an interrupted
white-washing of the fowlhouse to find
Rufus spluttering and struggling in the
whitewash. When I rescued him he hiked
off toward the stables, where the rest of
the fowls were scratching. The young
Leghorn spotted him and forthwith went
beak and claws for the white stranger.
In the ensuing brawl the Leghorn was
winning easily on points when it stopped
right in the middle of a ferocious sally,
gave a horrified squawk and fled. It had
suddenly recognised its old opponent.

“Old-timer”: Murrayville drowsed
in the late • afternoon, the shops closed
and nobody about the streets. Just
where the Cowangie-road left the town a
drunk lay in the shade of a mallee clump,
hat over eyes, arms extended. Time
passed and the sun moved the shade from
that drunk and began to shine upon him,
while a little breeze drifted along the
road. A large, nondescript dog, a
.stranger to Murrayville, rounded the pub
corner, investigated an ancient boot lying
in the gutter, eyed the other side of the
road thoughtfully, then pricked its ears
as the little breeze brought it a message.
The dog ambled down the road to the
drunk, greeted him effusively if somewhat
warily, licked his face experimentally,
flopped in the dust and waited. Presently
it arose, whined anxiously, smelt the
drunk all over, licked his face again and
appeared greatly concerned. Then it
i seized the man’s coat in its teeth and with
gradually increasing strength tried to tug
him away. By this time two small boys
and a woman were observing the dog’s
actions and the woman called to her hus-
band, “Tom, just look at that poor, faith-
ful old thing. The man is drunk and his
dog is trying to move him out of the sun.
Isn’t it pathetic?” Tom came forth and
interestedly watched the dog’s efforts.
Then he crossed the road, spoke to the
dog and patted it. “Good ole feller. All
right, he doesn’t deserve it, but I’ll help
shift y’r boss. Just as well he’s got a mate
like you t’ look after him.” Tom got his
hands under the drunk’s shoulders and
rolled him over. Whereupon that dog
pounced joyfully on the parcel of meat
which had been underneath and fled with
its booty in the direction of South Aus-
tralia.

“Giddup”: The Murray hermit who
had trouble with his heels wearing on
one side (B. 24/7/’46) must have been a
cousin of the one I met. He couldn’t
account for the angle his newly-cobbled
heels quickly assumed, until he happened
to get hold of a book on geography. Now
he’s convinced that every time he goes
for a walk, he’s providing one more proof
that the earth is round.

“Horseless Horseman”: Years ago,
when new to the Kimberleys and abos,
I went off-siding to a professional bird-
catcher in the huge unoccupied area south
of the river below Fitzroy Crossing
(W.A.). We were warned that tribal
fights were raging among the semi-wild
blacks there, but my boss was only
worried about snaring painted finches.
and anyway for a week we never sighted
a Binghi. Then, out alone one day, I
climbed a huge gum by the riverside to
examine a birdtrap when I spotted six
beauteous young gins fording the shallow
stream in their birthday suits. No, boys,
you’re wrong! I simply let out a loud
whistle, and the gins thereupon bobbed
down in the water with just their eyes
showing. Each time they cautiously be-
gan to move across river 1 had a great
game repeating the whistle. Then, hap-
pening to glance below 1 nearly fell out
of the tree with fright, for creeping
stealthily up to the butt were six huge,
warlike bucks clasping fists full of glass-
headed spears. I was just anticipating
a violent transition to a happier life when
one abo, looked up and said, “Gibbet
this pfella baccy?”

“Atlanta”: “Herbert Dawson’s” dingo
experience (B. 10/7/’46) reminds me of
an encounter with an aggressive boar. I
was walking, on the lookout for ’roos,
when the boar bounded unexpectedly
from his camp under a low wilga, trotted
a few yards and turned inquisitively with
hackles raised, A snap shot from the
deadly little .22 Hornet dropped him in
his* tracks—the bullet had passed through
his loins, paralysing the hind legs. With
jaws champing and beady eyes gleaming
wickedly, he tried several times to rise
while I approached for a finishing shot.
A dozen yards away I raised the rifle,
when with a sudden bound he was almost
upon me. The bullet ploughed a deep
furrow along the armor-plated shoulder
but failed to stop him, and I broke evens
over the gilgais with the boar “woof,
woofing” in close pursuit. But he veered
suddenly in another direction and a final
shot finished him,

“Laetitia”: The papai gorged at Torres
Strait tribal feasts is for Spartan stomachs
only. It is a bundle of green banana
leaves in which a weird confection is
cooked on the maowrie, or oven of white-
hot stones. Turtle and dugong flesh, pig
and fowl meat, trevally and bluefish are
garnished with rice, taro, yams, sweet
potato and manioca. The lot is then
steeped in coconut milk and roasted.
One papai, about the size of an outsize
Rugby ball and weighing up to eight
pounds, is the normal serving per man.

“B. A. Ker”: Thirty years ago Clay-
more’s place was a picture. True, rooms
had been added to the house until there
was scarcely headroom under the final
lean-to, and even then the bottle-necked
chimney was beginning to get a Pisa-ish
look ; but the garden was as prolific as
Eden. The Claymores have been gone
many years; white-ants have riddled the
weatherboards; the building seems to
have broken her back and the chimney
is now a positive challenge to gravity.
There, with his arms leaning precariously
on the broken-down fence, I found the
stranger. He jerked a thumb toward the
weed-covered waste: “Ain’t that Clay-
more’s old place?” I confirmed his sur-
mise. “ ’Struth,” his thin, dejected face
lit up, “if only a man knew where to
dig.” With visions of the inevitable pickle
bottle full of sovereigns, I pressed him.
“Sovereigns!” he spat his disgust. “No.
Better than that. I was goin’ with one
of the daughters at the time —it was the
Christmas before the First War. In those
days grocers used to give Christmas
boxes. The Claymores were good pays
and good eaters, so the storekeeper sent
a decent present —three quart bottles of
old port. Well, the old wowser buried ’em
somewhere in the garden—he wouldn’t
break them because that would be wanton
waste. And to think that they’re still
there —somewhere, and with 32 more
years of maturing! Wouldn’t it make
you speak ill of the dead?”

“R.E.”: Talking to old Jim one day
I asked him what was the matter with his
dog, that never barked during the day,
but always started about 10 o’clock at
night. “Well, it’s like this,” Jim replied
slowly. “Tiger’s not too quick on the up-
take, and it’s not until night-time that
he realises the things that he should have
barked at during the day!”

“Gravelsnatcher”: Under the jetties at
the foot of Barrack-street, Perth, where
the ferries leave on their mile trip across
the Swan, I’ve often seen large heaps oi
squirming catfish, measuring several feet
in diameter and containing hundreds or
fish. In my ignorance of things aquatic
I had subscribed to the popular belief that
I was viewing spawning operations. Now
“Naturala” assures me (B. 17/7/’46) that
“during the spawning season the female
catfish constructs a small circle” (»
stones) “just big enough for her to cod
around in” and that therein she deposits
her eggs. What then is the explanation
of the gatherings I witnessed? They are
seasonal and are apparently attended oy
every adult catfish for miles. Not jus*
the old school reunion, surely?.
THEY FOLLOWED THE FOX
I never approach the sly creature
Except with a trap or a gun,
Although it has long been a feature
Of evil out here on the run,
A curse on the ducks and the chickens;
In fact, we’d consign to the stocks
That ill-advised son of the Dickens
Who introduced Reynard the Fox.
But' over in Eire, the Bradys
—Allergic (which grieves me) to Verse —
When not in pursuit of the ladies,
Went out in pursuit of the Curse.
In funny top-hats and tight breeches,
O’er brambles and hedges and rocks
And gullies and fences and ditches
They rode in the wake of the fox!
The Hunt, in the end, an obsession
Became, one has heard, with the clan,
Till bailiffs and proctors in session
To hunt those great hunters began!
The plate at Raheen was converted,
And creditors clamored in flocks
For rents that these sportsmen diverted
To keep up two packs—for the fox.
They broke a few necks without warning,
And one, who came down by Mynoe,
Went west on the wings of the morning,
To “Yoicks! He’s out! Talljiho!”
With jacket and crop, in respect, they
Adorned his remains in the box;
With rev’rent hands, I expect they
Included the “brush” of the fox.
The animal never inspired me
With aught, save dislike, at the least.
I’m doubtful if they’d have admired me
For loathing the sight of the beast.
I’ll own that I’m fond of the ladies;
For baccy I’d break open locks,
But, by all the brimstone of Hades,
I’m down on this Cult of the Fox.
When sighting my rifle I think of
The money they wasted on tails!
Good coin that the comforting clink of
O’er discord and danger prevails
So, pressing the trigger’s a pleasure—
I don’t care a rap who it shocks,
I’ll hand him hot lead, without measure,
That sneaking disaster the Fox.
VICTORIA.

“E. 2”: Skinner, on the point of head-
ing for the township, discovered that the
Jersey bull was out, and yelled to Abe to
find and get him back. Abe grabbed the
sorrel mare and made haste up the road,
tore around the block and set off at a
wild gallop along the creek. No good ;
so Abe put an urgent ’phone call through
to his boss. He had just finished when a
noise came from the garden. There was
the truant bull, mowing down the last
remains of the flourishing crop of peas
and cabbages. “Crikey, that’s torn it,”
reflected Abe. “Jist about do me job
over this. Skinner’ll be fit t’ murder me
when he finds I’ve wasted tuppence ring-
in’ him up.”

“Nagheer”: Thirty years ago croco-
diles were almost unknown in the Bur-
dekin River (N.Q.), above the Ravens-
wood Falls. Now they are plentiful, and
have even invaded the Sutton-Cape River
system as far up as Laurasleigh. They
are not the harmless Johnstone’s croco-
dile, but porosus, the genuine seagoing
article. One measuring 15ft. was recently
shot in the Sutton at Cranbourne. The
old arguments over the most vulnerable
mark for making sure of the saurians
still rage when the beer is on, and the
ancient legend that the skin will turn a
bullet survives. On the live animal, the
skin of the body is no harder than that
of an old bullock, and a charge of double-
B shot from a 12-bore behind a foreleg
at anything up to 40ft. range will settle
any croc. For long ranges a filed .303
bullet, lodged in the flattened patch of
skin located about two-thirds of the way
along the side of the neck, is instantly
fatal. One of Jack Hamilton’s feats was
to bag two crocs., one 14ft., the other
just under 16ft., with two successive shots
from a .45 Colt revolver at a range of
nearly 40 yards. The neck mark, little
bigger than a man’s palm, was his target
in both.

“Mat’s Mate”: “I was toilin’ once,”
said Mat, “with a bloke who had seven
daughters—Grace, Phoebe, Mary, Alice,
Annie, Esmay and Clutha: don’t reckon
I’ll ever forget them names. The youngest
was 17 and the eldest just over 30. The
bloke was mighty proud of ’em, too,
didn’t talk about much else an’ was
slavin’ away on his farm for ’em. They
was good girls, the best I ever heard of,
an’ when me an’ him was out in the pad-
dick he’d talk an’ wonder about ’em—
whether they’d get married or go for
“ That's the last time he’ll pinch my oysters!
them women’s careers. They’d bin
brought up proper, too, no funny business
about any of ’em, which isn’t to be said
of all big families of girls. Cripes, he
was proud of ’em! Had their pieshers at
different ages all over the place an’ was
always tellin’ me what Mary said or how
Alice an’ Annie sang an’ all that. The
whole bang lot of ’em could cook, make
dresses an’ run a house. Yair, he’d talk
t’ me aft day an’ at night I’d hop into me
bunk an’ think about them girls an how
they was a credit to their old man. It
seemed t’ me the bloke that married any
of ’em would be lucky, an’ by cripes he d
ha’ had the old man on t’ him, too, 11
he’d tried any funny business.” He
paused, with a rather lost look in his
eyes. Thinking I’d unearthed a secret love
or something I said, “Gosh, it’s a wonder
y’ didn’t marry one of ’em yourself?
“Who, me?” Mat answered. “Gripes, I
never even saw ’em. They was all down
in Adelaide somewhere an’ me an’ him
was emu-bobbin’ way up above Mildura.
He fell athinking a moment, then glared
at me and roared, “ ’Struth, y’ don’t think
I’d ha’ stayed there a bloomin’ day it
they’d bin there, do y’? Me an’ seven
single females! Lord, a man wouldn t
ha’ had a hope.” And he looked some-
what scared as he visualised the horror
of it- , , .

“B. 4”: Early on frosty nights curlews
often utter a few preliminary moaning
notes (B. 17/7/’46) prior to bursting into
that glorious crescendo of plaintive
melody. For a long-distance comparison
you may take the sounds emitted by the
lodger in the bath before he breaks into
his song. Be this as it may, Gollschew-
sky’s comparison of the fox’s yelping-
barking-mewing noise to a crying baby
is apt and his pithy phrases are indicative
of real bush lore.

“Timothy Tywire”: “Alpine Willie’s”
account of the “axle-creak’ call of the
wagon-wheel bird (B. 24/7/’46) settles a
mystery- that’s been a pebble in the boot
to me for years. It likewise vindicates
the veracity of the old hands of these
parts who claim that a bird-species had
remarkably changed its characteristic call
within a period of 30 years or so. Clearly
the wagon-wheel bird’s call out here a
long diminuendo hiss followed by ,a
“flubber-flubber-flubber”— shows that the
creature is capable of keeping abreast of
the wheels of progress, pneumatic-tyred
variety. .

“Sou’-west”: The tailer has, in keeping
with its voracity, a simpler set of digestive
organs than any other fish in the
South Seas. All that is found on open-
ing it is a long sleevelike stomach and
only the trace of intestines. But so well
supplied with digestive juice is this
stomach that the meal, which according
to the size of the fish may be a four-inch
smelt or a ten-inch mullet, will be digested
at the lower end while the end near the
entrance is untouched. The stomach,
too, has great expansive capacity;
although seemingly filled by one good-
sized fish it will stretch so that two or
three more of the same size can be
accommodated, all becoming more or less
digested at the one time. Yet even with
its stomach crammed full the tailer will
come at a bait.

“Wippegong”: Overseas, a fellow
realised how deeply his roots had struck
in his native bush. When, in a hot Central
Indian dusk, peacocks farewelled the day
from high in a couple of lemon-scented
gums it wasn’t these exiles one saw, u
the white trunks of Sherbrooke, with t e
lyrebirds climbing to roost. In Kunming
the presence of a bluegum avenue rather
dimmed the view of those strange neigh-
bors Marco Polo’s cobblestone road and
the American pipeline, and the southern
gullies rose instead ; and the fragrance
from the young silver-grey leaves, crushed
in the hand, banished even the most pug-
nacious local aromas. The poincianas in
Chowringee were good, but “Ah! ” you’d
say, “you should see them in Brisbane!”
Cherry-blossom time in Japan was pro-
fuse and dainty; but deep was the pride
in knowing that wattle time along the
brown Gippsland streams was a richer
spectacle. And so home; and, patter-
“Who pinched me tin of paint ?”
ing through the biggest chain store in our
biggest city, one sees dozens of young
wattles in pots, promise of glory to come.
But in front of these native emblems,
written large for the instruction of those
apparently in need of it, is a large label:
“Flowers yellow.” Good God!

“Edjudina”: A steak off a young cow
camel is not to be distinguished from
a slice of. cow beef —that’s if the diner
happens to be far into the Gt. Victoria
Desert, and the only beef that he has seen
for months came out of a tin. The white
man’s prejudice against camel flesh is not
shared by the Gyppo or the Bedouin,
both of whom will wolf camel at every
opportunity, although the oont is the
beast of burden in both their father-
lands.

“Carmi”: A young Darling Downs (Q.)
couple, wanting a new bath, were referred
by their hardware dealer to a Govern-
ment department, which sent them a
closely printed questionnaire two fools-
cap pages long. After reading the first
half-page, they folded it up and returned
it to the department with a sad covering
letter saying they had neither time nor
money to spare for a correspondence
course in filling in forms. A week later
their dealer wrote to say that their bath
was waiting. Others who filled in the
said form “in toto” three years ago still
await their bathtubs.

“Zake”: A common belief is that a
bushfire’s speed is controlled by the wind
behind it. It is a fallacy. I once stood
above a thick scrub gully out from Mur-
rurundi (N.S.W.) on a breezeless, scorch-
ing January day and watched a fire tear
through it at around 30 miles an hour
and with a roar like Calwell when some-
one mentions a newspaper. Such a bush-
fire seems to send a wind-in front of it.

“D.R.H.”: Two or three hundred
million years ago the sun shone on some
green swamp plants. They were primitive
as plants go, but even then they were
the most perfect pieces of machinery that
have ever been invented on this earth.
Each plant was busy taking in water from
the mud below, carbon dioxide from the
air above and energy from the sun. Each
plant very neatly, as plants still do, split
up the water and CO2 into their elements,
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, wrapped
up the sun-energy in a neat little chemical
parcel, throwing away a little surplus
oxygen like an unwanted piece of string.
Each plant thereafter, when needing
energy for its life activities, “breathed in”
an amount of oxygen equivalent to the
discarded portion, thereby unwrapping the
parcel, abstracting the energy and giving
off the, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in
the form of water and carbon dioxide.
Unlike any man-made engine, there was
no fuss or waste of energy about the
process. Some of the energy parcels,
however, were stored up against a. cloudy
day or used to provide materials for
growth—these became a part of the plant.
And presently the plant died and became
a part of the black mass of dead vegeta-
tion beneath the shallow waters about.
And that’s how it happened that I went
for a ride in a train the other day, pulled
along by an engine that was using energy
stored up by green things from the Palaeo-
zoic sun in that far off time when fishes
were learning to walk. (This is not to be
regarded as capitalistic propaganda and
is in no way suitable for use as an excuse
for another coal strike.)

“Hanko”: “Come m, blarst yer! yelled
Big Joe. The door opened and there stood
the overseer and the station governess.
Big Joe dropped his pipe and had trouble
in finding it. “Ahem,” the overseer said ;
“Miss Norris is anxious to hear Snow-
flake play on the gumleaf. What about
it, Jackie?” The abo’s eyes flickered
nervously about the hut and he squirmed
and wriggled on his kerosene-case seat.
“Oh, please, Mr. Snowflake,” trilled Miss
Norris. “I’ll git some leaves,” said Bailey,
and forthwith dashed outside, returning
with a tuft of foliage. The abo. riffled the
leaves; selected one, and then broke into
a terrific sneezing. Watery-eyed, he glared
about to locate Bailey, but a further
sneezing fit took him and he surrendered
to the violence of it. We all felt uncom-
fortable ; the overseer scowled, and the
governess bit at a corner of her hanky.
Snowflake sneezed on ; his eyes streamed,
and he waved his bunch of gumleaves
like a fan. Thereupon we all got the nose-
tickling infection and there was a stam-
pede for the door. Miss Norris gave a
series of high soprano sneezes and fled
giggling to the homestead. The overseer
tried to walk away with hauteur, but he
didn’t succeed overmuch. No man can
walk with hauteur and his nostrils full
of pepper,

“Bumpk”: Jack, hired to do some
ploughing, brought three pigs in bags into
our paddock and laid them down under
a tree. Mary, a grazing draughthorse
anticipating a feed, came over and nosed
the bags, which got up and started running
about the paddock. Mary went for her
life, and after careering round the pad-
dock. got tangled in the fence. Jack
released her, and for the rest of the day
Mary, sensing some mysterious menace,
stuck as close to him as a shadow.

“C.E.”: The boss gaped at the car-
casses on the ridge ; then, dashing back to
the house, he made for the ’phone and
called the dingo man. “That you,
‘Spud’? There’s a dingo killin’ in me
creek paddock. If y’ll come right away
I’ll make it well worth y’r while when y’
catch him.” That afternoon the old
trapper pitched camp on the creek and
started work. He .examined the car-
casses and the ground thereabouts; then,
going outside the fence, he began hunt-
ing tracks. An hour later he shook his
head slowly at the landscape, kicked his
traps into a heap and retired. Up before
dawn, he hid himself in a bush and
peered through the moonlight at the sheep
camp. Two nights he waited, then he cap-
tured the big white and tan collie and
chained it at the camp. Followed three
days without further disturbance, then on
his way in to report, the old dog-man met
banker O’Reilly. “Haven’t seen a big
white and tan collie out this way, have
you?” the banker inquired. “Well,”
“Spud” began, “I’ve got”—— “Big dog,
he is,” explained the banker. “Nicely
marked. Got a pedigree big as a war
debt.” “Yair, as I was sayin’,” nodded
“Spud,” “I got” “I’d hate to lose
him,” worried the banker. “I’m offering
ten pounds’ reward. You were saying?”
“Eh?” gasped “Spud.” “Oh, just that I
got —er —I got t’ see the boss erbout the
size of a dingo bonus, but —ten quid, eh?
Awright, well. I’ll let y’ know if I run
inter that collie.”
RIVER GUMS.
As palm-trees sigh for the sea-wind
In islands far away,
The river gums to the river
Their endless homage pay.
Gallants are they in waiting
To a splendid queen who goes
In midnight’s gleaming silver
Or morning’s misty rose.
They praised her in sighing paeans
Under the watching stars,
There where the deeps lie hidden,
Here by the river-bars.
Though in far forest places
The woodsman’s axe strikes hard,
The river gums for ever
Their river queen shall guard.

Fly Strike and the Mules Operation.
“Atlanta”: The ninth annual report of
the Australian Wool Board, in referring
to the modified Mules operation, men-
tions that “on one property there was a
high incidence of fly strikes in the opera-
tion wounds when lambs were treated at
marking 'time. This was associated with
the relatively long wool on the breech
which led to matting and infection of the
wound, and graziers should know of this
risk if they elect to use the operation on
un-crutched lambs.”
On our property, near St. George
(s.-w. Q.), we had a similar experience
recently. The sheep treated were 1000
nine-months’-old dense-woolled, mixed
sexes, shorn January, but crutched again
specially for the occasion.
Despite prolonged dry conditions, the
green blowfly was particularly active in
the autumn, with high incidence of
strikes, and in the sheep muled and
yarded a week later 3 p.c. had to be
treated, with a greater number the fol-
lowing week, although a subsequent
series of frosts seems to have deterred
the fly a little.
Incidentally, a neighbor who muled his
weaners in April, six , weeks off-shears,
reported no trouble from the fly,
although extremely prevalent at that
time.
The C.S.I.R.’s advice that operation
wounds will heal in about a week is not
borne out by personal experience.
Around five weeks has been the average
time taken in all instances investigated
here, although the degree of wrinkliness
present on the breech, and consequent
wound size, are largely the determining
factors.
When muling here we work with two
catchers and two operators, each part-
nership averaging 350 to 400 per day. If
the work is performed in the yards the
catcher’s task will be made easier if the
sheep are held in the Bin.-wide hollow
formed by fastening an additional rail
outside the posts and level with the top
rail of the catching-pen.
Use dagging shears only, as most other
types are too strong for continuous use,
and see that these are properly set and
sharpened. Shears are ground similarly
to a pair of scissors: firstly about an
inch back from the edge of the blade,
and then again with a 45 degree cold-
chisel angle. Grind lightly on a fine
emery disk and keep a tin of water handy
to avoid burning.
At the McMaster laboratory experi-
ments are at present being carried out
to determine the effect of the removal of
a section of skin from the upper surface
of the tails, by which it is hoped that
the resultant retraction of wool-growing
skin from the sides and tip of the tail
will reduce soiling by urine and fseces,
and thus reduce tail strike. So far at the
trials, flies have not been active enough
to prove conclusively the degree of im-
munity which may be expected.
Wool Labelling.
“Delaine”: Legislation to compel label-
ling of articles made from wool has been
prepared by some Australian States, and
New Zealand and South Africa are fol-
lowing suit. The U.S.A. has a Labelling
Act under which all articles containing
wool carry a label showing the percent-
age of every kind of fibre, if sold for
home consumption. A close check is
kept on it. Consumers there attach great
importance to the labels, and manufac-
turers realise the selling value of the
label.
In Britain the position is unsatisfac-
tory. According to law, any article con-
taining 15 p.c. of wool may be sold as
“woollen.” “Wool” is evidently an elastic
term, as it has been defined as including
any fibre from the coat or fleece of
alpaca, camel, goat, hare, horse, lamb,
llama, rabbit, sheep, vicuna or yak.
Through some oversight, human hair, cow
hair and pig bristles have been omitted.
It seems farcical that material could be
made up and described as woollen though
it did not contain a fibre of real wool;
especially since the coupon rating of
woollen goods in England is 50 p.c. higher
than that of other materials.
. Fallowing.
H. F. White; Is it a sound practice
as a long-term policy (B. 24/7/’46)? We
have been much too prone to judge prac-
tices on short-term experiences. Experi-
ments in South Africa showed that fallow
contributed least of all soil treatments to
the intake of moisture, while ungrazed
pasture contributed most. Recent pub-
lications from England give a'statement
by a Rothamsted scientist that rain falling
on fallowed soil forms a seal, and con-
duces to maximum run-off, even with the
best fallow.
The American yearbook of agriculture.
Soil and Men, shows that under fallow
there is a build-up of nitrogen, but at the
expense of the organic matter in the soil.
This nitrogen is wide open to leach-
ing by any water absorbed, when there is
no crop to hold it. It is generally ad-
mitted now that the Dust Bowl was the
result of loss of organic matter. Investi-
gations in England showed that under
constant cropping over a period of 50
years there was a loss of 33 p.c. in organic
matter; in America the loss was 38 p.c.
over a period of 60 years. Dr. Phipps,
at a C.S. and I.R. discussion, said that
investigations in South Australia showed
a progressive decrease in yields of wheat
in spite of improved fertilisers and wheat
varieties, and that this could only be
attributed to loss in organic matter.
The U.S.A. yearbook suggests that the
increased growth following the ploughing-
in of temporary pasture might be due in
part to the increased intake of moisture
by this pasture. I suggest that the in-
creased yield following fallow might be
due to the build-up of nitrogen. To sum
up it would appear that the only benefit
from fallow is moisture retained ; there
is a disastrous loss of organic matter, con-
tributing to soil erosion. The ultimate
long-range result must be those disasters
which are apparent all over our wheat
areas. The solution is much more fre-
quent periods under temporary pastures
grazed by sheep and cattle.
Stopping Drift.
“Myrrhee”; On a series of demonstra-
tion areas in the Mallee last year the Vic.
Department of Agriculture proved the
worth of ryecorn in holding badly-blown
sandhills. The trials were at Danyo, Tor-
rita, Ouyen, Lascelles and Walpeup.
Treatment consisted in levelling hilltops,
breaking up hard subsoil and sour
patches, pulling out exposed stumps and
sowing the whole area to ryecorn. A
standard seeding rate of 451 b. ryecorn
per acre was used, with 451 b. to 601 b.
“The blades are all right — it's that cheap
shaving soap you use!”
superphosphate. To ascertain the value
of super, on this type of country, some
strips were sown without manure, and
sample harvestings from the supered areas
showed a marked increase in yield.
The trials proved that ryecorn could
be successfully established on badly
eroded Mallee soils which were once
thought incapable of supporting any sort
of vegetable cover. As well as retarding
blowing, the ryecorn on the sides of the
sand ridges caught and held most of the
moving soil that came to it.
An Onion Grader.
“Steve”; Onion growers as a rule are
allowed a moderate percentage of small
onions, even picklers, in their consign-
ments. Two years ago the buyers did
not mind if 30 to 35 p.c. of the onions
were small. At that time picklers were
selling around £l7 and £lB a ton tor
Brown Spanish. Today it’s different, with
picklers at £5 a ton and table onions at
£l4 10s. If the inspector spots any
picklers at all in the load, provided the
rest of the onions are of only moderate
size the load is rejected.
Many small growers are building onion
tables to grade their unwanted onions.
I made one for 6s. Bd, Cut three hard-
wood 3in. x lin. to fit in the floor of the
wagonette or utility truck. Tack £in.
slats at the correct spacing on them. * In
the case of the truck with higher sides
the grating can be given the correct slope.
When it is a wagonette the front wheels
can be raised on blocks. Of course, every
half-dozen bags or so the frame must be
lifted to clear out the skins. It is a great
convenience to be able to move this table
to any part of the farm.
Carrots and Strychnine.
“Horseless Horseman”: Rabbits can
be poisoned almost anywhere with car-
rots and strychnine, though half the art
is where and how you make
the trail. Rabbits, for some
unaccountable reason, will
only follow a waving trail—
and it is best put out with a
light, one-furrow garden
mouldboard. Then you
have a good furrow which,
tearing the green grass up
by the roots, forms a pad
for the cottontails. Be sure
to make wavy circles around
warrens and feeding
grounds.
For free-feeding cut car-
rots any size, laying more
each night as required.
Then after three or four
feeds, if the rodents are pad-
ding the trail well and tak-
ing the vegetable, poison the
f ollovshng night. Baits
should be sound £in. cubes,
and about three-eighths of
the quantity of the last free«
feed will be needed. Where
rabbits are fairly thick, a
kerosene-tinful will do a
five-mile trail, and to this
amount spread out on a bag
mix s£lb. of white sugar.
Leave the cubes for an
hour, during which time the
sugar will cause the carrots
to sweat. Next, carefully
dolly the strychnine crystals
to powder, then dust it
evenly over the baits from an old pepper
castor. Leave the dusted cubes for three
hours at least, while the chemical action
of the sugar on the strychnine takes place.
One ounce of poison to 16lb. of carrots
will do, but if the bunnies are fat use
loz, to 141 b.
Baits are best carried in a half-sugar-
bag slung from the shoulder, and should
be laid by hand so the quantity distri-
buted can be varied according to loca-
tion of the rabbits. The poisoner should
be off the trail at least an hour before
sunset.
Provided care is taken in applying the
strychnine, carrots have many advantages
over apples as a bait. They are easier to
handle, ants don’t carry them off the trail,
they are cheaper and will keep for weeks
if buried in damp ground.

London wool
sales to start again
in September
NEW COMMITTEE FORMED
Auction sales of wool will be resumed in the London market in September, and will
continue at regular intervals as before the war. Six firms of London Selling Wool Brokers have
formed the Committee of London Wool Brokers to handle wool consigned to the London
market for sale.
Although the constituent firms have pooled their resources for the most efficient conduct
of wool sales, yet each firm will preserve its separate identity and will continue to maintain its
individual relationship with its clients.
The organisation will be run by an executive committee drawn from the constituent firms,
and will be staffed almost entirely by employees of these firms.
The opening series of sales can hardly include any new clip wool, but the London Brokers
look forward to the early re-appearance in their catalogues of wool consigned to this market
for sale. All Shippers will continue to receive the individual attention of Brokers as they have
done in the past.

Fowls in the North.
“Xob33”: Elements of successful poul-
try farming in North Queensland are:
control of diseases by proper sanitation ;
keep a record of the flock, its produc-
tion, returns and expenses; have deep,
roomy nests, floored with sawdust or
shell-grit to prevent egg breakage ; breed
for vigor, egg production and breed char-
acteristics ; cull ail the year round, not
once a year; keep only active birds;
don’t breed more chickens at a time than
you can rear properly; provide sound
housing, watch for leaks and crevices
likely to cause draughts; feed well.
Build the houses so that they will re-
ceive a maximum amount of sunshine,
with the floors a few inches above ground
level. Provide good drainage for the wet
season. Dust baths are essential. Make
them consisting of two parts of sand, one
part loam, one part wood ashes, and a
small quantity of dusting powder. Supply
plenty of fresh water and shell-grit, two
of the most important items in a fowl’s
life. .
Feed mash on trays or in troughs;
distributing it on the ground means con-
siderable waste. When pullets have
started to lay, don’t change their feetf
ration or shift them to new quarters;
this brings on a false moult.
Provide plenty of scratching material.
Exercise creates appetite, which means
more food consumed, resulting in more
eggs. Collect the eggs frequently and
store in a cool place. Market at least
twice a week. Keep a strict watch for
red mite and other external parasites.
Don’t overcrowd the poultry on the
farm or when crating for market. Ten
pairs of light breeds or eight pairs of
heavier breeds are sufficient for the stan-
dard fowl crate. Give the stock Epsom
salts once a week regularly and add per-
manganate of potash to the drinking
water once a week. Destroy egg-eaters
as soon as they’re detected and watch out'
for cannibalism.
Hints for the Farm. ,
“Sarina”; A yard or loose-box used
for housing sick stock can become a hot-
bed of germs if allowed to. become dirty.
A nag can be put into snug quarters to
recover from one complaint and emerge
suffering from another. Fresh air is a
great enemy of disease germs, but in
closed sheds antiseptic solutions and
cleanliness are better for getting rid of
infection.
“Hist”: Don’t broadcast tomato seed,
but sow it in rows about lOin. apart
When plants are 2in. to 3in. high, run
a sharp knife along the rows 2in. under
the soil so as to cut the taproots. Then
water immediately to reset the loosened
soil. Cutting the taproot promotes a
busy growth of roots and reduces any
check or losses at transplanting.
“E. 2”: Use of agricultural lime on
pasture paddocks may lead to greatly im-
proved grazing capacity, and, though a
hard and fast rule may not be laid down,
guidance should be sought by experiment
or determination of the soil condition by
an expert. Clovers, in common with many
legumes, appreciate lime. In two adjoin-
ing paddocks I’ve noticed lately, the sub.
clover treated to a lime application is in
lush growth and carries leaf much bigger
than average ; the other, similar soil and
pasture not dressed with lime, appears
starved by comparison.
“Farmer Bill”: Lucerne meal’s a
valuable substitute for green feed for
poultry. It supplies vitamin A and color-
ing matter for the eggs. As it’s not over-
palatable to the hens, introduce it gradu-
ally into the mash—lo p.c. is sufficient,
15 p.c. the limit. It can’t be used as a
direct substitute for bran. Don’t confuse
lucerne meal with lucerne chaff, which is
valueless to birds. . >
“H.C.”; Extracting honey before its
ripened by the bees is poor wisdom. The
product is weak-bodied and liable to
fermentation owing to high moisture con-
tent. Capping over of the cells is one
sure guide that the bees have finished
their processing job. Wait till then. *
“Bumble”: Painting of bee boxes, if
correctly done, should be a lifetime job.
Before unpacking the boards, paint the
ends with priming paint, thus saving the
extra time and labor' in doing each one
separately. Make up the boxes and give
them a coat of priming paint inside and
out. Two coats of white paint are needed
for a durable finish. Use best quality
paint that is ground in pure linseed oil.
“Sundowner”: Experiments by Vic.
Department of Agriculture reveal that a
spray of Bordeaux mixture 6:4:40 in
mid-winter will reduce the percentage of
apricot trees infected by scab or “shot-
hole” from 77 p.c. to 2 p.c.

-see that you get full value for it
HARD-EARNED money deserves
careful spending, and yet the
problem to-day is just how to get full
value for the money we have to spend.
A lot of the things we’d like to buy
are scarce at present, and if we all
rush in with our wages and bid for
what is available, then the goods go
to the highest bidder. That is the
kind of thing that forces prices up,
raises the cost of living, and decreases
the value of our money.
By far the most sensible plan to-day is
to spend as little as we reasonably can
... to buy only what we need ... to
save a good percentage of our earnings
each week . . . and to put these savings
aside in Commonwealth Bonds and
Savings Certificates. In that way
money earns interest at better than
bank rates, and will be available in
the future to spend on the “buyers’
market” that will come when goods
are plentiful again.
Savings Certificates may be purchased
at any Bank or Money Order Post
Office, and advance subscriptions to
the next Commonwealth Cash Loan
may be made through any Bank or
Stockbroker.
THIS IS HOW YOU CAN HELP
TO KEEP PRICES DOWN
1. Spend wisely. Get full value. Buy only
what you really need. Save all you can.
Hold all your Bonds and Savings
Certificates.
2. Share and share alike the goods avail-
able . . . don’t foster the black-market by
paying more than maximum prices. Check
all prices with the lists available.
3. Keep your own prices down. Don’t
take advantage of shortages to ask more
for your goods or services.
4. Pay your way—settle your debts—make
no new ones.
5. Invest your savings, at better than bank
interest, in Commonwealth Bonds and Sav-
ings Certificates. When goods are plentiful
you can make good use of the money you
save now.

direct question, “she’ll be bound to get
stung pretty regular, wearing those
flimsy things she does.”
The other man opened one shining
eye.
“She’s a reasonable woman.”
His eye fell shut and he was asleep
again, hauling each breath up from a
rumbling depth beneath the counterpane.
Hubie lingered a minute at the window,
saddened and admiring. He picked up
his sack of bottles and walked slowly
down the yard.
14 \/ OUR Dad’s breathing bad,” he told
I his niece.
She pulled up her chin. “He’s been
worse before,, I could hear it from the
sink last time.” She made for the house.
From the top step of the porch she
turned to face him with a naively secre-
tive little smile. “And even you, for all
your lies, can’t say you can hear it from
the sink this time.”
Then, well pleased by her taunt, she left
him blankly regarding the empty porch.
She was waiting at the door of her
father’s room when Hubie came pushing
through a dividing curtain into the
narrow passage. She showed no surprise
at his entry.
“Start here,” she said.
It was a game—a kitten set to pounce
on a shadow.
• She tiptoed back down the passage
with the muffled growling from her
father’s room to guide her. Hubie, bent
under his sack of bottles, lumbered along-
side.
“Here,” she said. “It stops here.”
Hubie had his eyes upturned intently
to the ceiling. He fended off an umbrella-
stand—a plaster affair inlaid with sea-
shells —and kept on backing. He stopped
at the heavy dividing curtain.
“About here, I make it, Rhoda.”
The girl’s jubilation died. She glared
at him for a moment and her lower lip
fell slack.
“You’re not fair!” she burst out.
“You’d be glad if he died! You want
him to die!”
tie grinned as if it were torture. “It’ll
be the wax again,” he said, and tapped at
his ear. “It gets me fooled properly.”
She stood submissively as he placed his
hand on her shoulder. “It fools me
properly till I get it blown out.”
“You tell them, then,” she demanded.
Her suspicions were not altogether
allayed. “I’m the only one that under-
stands him ; and he’s been worse before
and he’s got better again.”
“Not a murmur past the umbrella-
stand, I’ll say, and you’ve heard it right
back there at the sink.”
“Yes, and a fortnight after that he was
over at the bees.”
“And who’s to say he won’t be back
at them again?” Hubie asked defiantly.
On his way out he tilted up a new hat
hanging on the wall, and noted with satis-
faction that the size stamped on the band
was the same as his own.
“And you’ll be havin’ comb-honey on
that fancy plate of yours, too,” he called
back over his shoulder.
U \\l E’RE working round to them
VV now,” the bee widow told Hubie
later when he asked about her hives of
section honey.
The pair of them were crouched over
an open hive. Scent wreathing round the
widow added pungency to the sweetish
humidity that rose from the combs. Her
cheery, puffball face was moist and
blurred behind her veil.
“Capped honey to the outside,” she
said.
Hampered by stout gauntlets, Hubie
was prising awkwardly at the frames with
a chisel.
“I want a nice block or two for Rhoda
and her dear old aunt when we get round
to the gate,” she said.
The bees came boiling up and Hubie
sent them back with a wristy tune on the
widow’s smoker,
“Dick would be gettin’ a good hand
at the game,” he said airily, apparently
risking nothing by the comparison.
“I do miss him,” she said, and touched
her veil against her glasses. She began
to sniffle. “I was glad he had such a
lovely funeral.”,
“I picked it.” Hubie’s boast was re-
spectfully subdued. “Soon’s he put me
wise to his bee-sting cure, I knew poor
old Dick was a goner.”
“Drone-cells,” the bee widow sobbed.
She took the chisel and dug it through
the comb.
“Ah, well,” Hubie sighed, “as I said
to Rhoda, our time comes when it
comes.”
“That’s all you told her?”
The widow’s question carried an under-
tone of teasing as she gained droll
mastery over her grief.
“Tell her nothing,” Hubie said. “Her
with her nose in the air. She’s a stuck-
up little tabby, that young Rhoda.”
The bee widow was blushing down to
the neckline of her dress. “You and your
bee-sting cure,” she gurgled, and coyly
shook a frame of bees in his face.
“Lookin’ down her nose at you as if
you was depraved or something,” he
went on unhappily. “She got that from
her mother, you know, and she got it
from her mother.” ... .
He grated out a laugh like a rough
gear-change —exposing the trickery of it
all —and as his gaze was drawn involun-
tarily across the gully to a chimney-pot
poking over an ivy hedge, his laughter
rang out as carefree as if a swarm of the
widow’s bees was loose inside his shirt.

“It Is authoritatively reported from Wash-
ington that Russia has outpaced the U.S.A.
in the development of long-range, guided rocket
weapons. Eighty Russian rockets recently
landed in Sweden and Norway. Experts ex-
amined them and found they were equipped
with controls designed to guide them electroni-
cally back to their launching sites. The con-
trols, however, were faulty.”—
The great Marshal Botchovitch, pride
of the Red Army, was in charge of
Operations Boomerangski, having re-
placed Marshal Cuckooski, who had died
of a heart attack shortly after a rocket
aimed at Greenland had wiped out a
battalion of spies being trained in Mur-
mansk for service overseas.
Marshal Botchovitch was well equipped
by tradition and training for the vital
task of demonstrating to an awe-struck
world how hopelessly behind Soviet
science were the decadent capitalist
Anglo-Saxons.
In the retreat from Pilsudski’s Fascist
mercenaries he had broken the Red Army
record by doing the 200 metres over a
ploughed field in 28 seconds flat, with
full pack up and his boots wrapped in
cornsacks. Promoted immediately to
political commissar, he upheld the best
Communist principles by having 250
factory-workers liquidated for complain-
ing about the 95-hour week. He was then
created a marshal and sent to the
great military college at Corpsk to
learn how to dance while sitting
on his heels, how to keep throw-
ing in more men frontally at a heavily
defended position until the enemy runs
out of ammunition, how best to eat 30-
course meals with vodka at each course
and, most important, of &11, how to let the
world know, although foreign correspond-
ents are forbidden to go within 500
miles of any Russian front, that you’ve
killed each month five times more of the
enemy than he has in the field.
He happened to have been at Mur-
mansk when a visiting British cruiser
had given a fireworks display and had
seen at comparartively close quarters how
catherine-wheels and rockets were set
"I've got no stock, either, but I DO keep this for
display purposes .”
off. He was obvious choice, therefore,
to succeed the late Marshal Cuckooski,
his chief technical adviser being Pro-
fessor Blobski.
“1 haven’t noticed any of the V7s we
fired last week come back,” he said,
“Have you heard what happened to them,
Comrade-Professor?”
, ~ , ~, ...
Yes Comrade-Marshal, answered the
man of science. We aimed them, com-
plete with returning device, at southern
Sweden, on the principle that if one hap-
pened to land on a village they would
only be mashed Swedes, which wouldn’t
give us indigestion—ha! ha! We heard
that two landed outside Lwow in what
used to be Poland, four fell in the
Behring Straits, three in Luxembourg,
one or two near Bessarabia and I thinß
a couple are still up there somewhere.”
“You know, of course, our beloved
Fiihrer will be greatly displeased should
he hear of these results. Of course,
there’s no real need for him to hear if —
er you have, I believe, quite a nice
country property that you have no use
for, have you not, Comrade-Professor?”
“But, Comrade-Marshal, there is yet
no evidence of anyone being killed by
them in those countries.”
“Idiot! Who said anything about our
god in the Kremlin being displeased
about so trifling a matter? I referred to
the technical failure, our lost prestige.

around with those captured German
weapons. Cease fitting those electronic
returning devices and attempt a straight
long-distance record. Aim this lot at
Denmark that’s a fairly crowded
country, though you might have some
difficulty in hitting such a small place.
But I’m keen to find out how many one
of these rockets can kill.”
Next day Professor Blobski reported
to the G.O.C. “1 have just sent off two
of our own latest-type rockets, the in-
vention of Pro-
fessor Gagaovitch.
They have no re-
turning device
attached. I aimed
it at Copenhagen.
It should be just
about there now.

At that moment
a crescendo roar
like that of an
oncoming express
train tore the
welkin. Marshal
Botchovitch beat
the professor to
the deep dugout
by two seconds,
and as they fell
down it a terrific
explosion rocked
their sanctuary.
Ten minutes
after the last bits
of launching sites
and camp had
stopped falling a
rifle volley rang
out. Shortly
after that Marshal Botchovitch was giving
instructions to the special correspondent
of “Red Star” attached to Operations
Boomerangski.
“Announce to the world, he was say*
ing, “that Professor Blobski has died
suddenly from dropsy. Simultaneously

searcb ou t its target by a new secret de-
vice and can be landed at w iu anywhere

an American baseball diamond.”
So saying, he stepped into his VB,
which had come on U.S. lend-lease
without a returning device, and drove off
to a 48-course banquet.

Honors for the Eighth
Twelve months ago the remnants of the
Eighth Division scattered throughout
Japanese horror camps heard at last that
their day of liberation was at hand. Some
did not hear until later ; some who did
hear were so emaciated that they could
not be moved for weeks; others passed
on after the last bugle sounded.
In the next few weeks there were many
tense moments and much anxiety as
recovery units, Australian and Allied war-
ships and air-force ’planes located the
survivors and transmitted the names to
reassure waiting relatives. Very soon
the appalling gaps in the lists became
evident. Some units had lost upwards
of 50 per cent, of their strength.
Much of the detail of the grim picture
of over three and a half years’ slavery
after Singapore, Java,: Timor, Ambon
and Rabaul is now known. Most of the
survivors have been reluctant to relate
the full story of their own frightful ex-
periences, while ever ready to tell of the
courage and devotion of their comrades.
The fortitude of the starved and tortured
beggars description, and words cannot
adequately express the fearlessness and
daring of the “fit.”
It is 12 months now since V.-P. Day,
yet the honors conferred upon members
of this heroic division can be counted on
the fingers of one hand.
In the Senate last year in a reference to
“our Australian forces (mostly detached
from the Eighth Division) based in
strategic positions in the islands guard-
ing the northern approaches to the Con-
tinent,” it was said:
The gallant stand made by these men
—many of whom have given their lives —
stayed the onward rush of the Japanese
hordes. I record these indisputable facts,
so that the name of the “Gull” force may
live always in the memory of the people of
this country.
Let’s hope it does! But will it?
General Blarney, since his retirement,
has expressed disappointment and amaze-
ment that Australia’s generals have not
been adequately recognised for their
successful leadership. By comparison, at
least with Eighth Division, the generals
have fared handsomely. Scarcely any of
them failed to collect at least one decora-
tion, and several received two or three.
Furthermore, most of them were pro-
moted to that rank during hostilities.
Perhaps the fact that there was no
promotion for officer p.-0.-w. must be
regarded as the “fortune of war,” but the
high example displayed by a number of
rankers in captivity stood out as a beacon
to their distressed comrades. Are these
n.c.os. and men also to be denied a com-
mission as well as being denied an honor?
None of the brave men in respect of
whom this is written would for a moment
suggest that they should be formally re-
warded or promoted, but I have more
than once heard it said by an admiring
survivor “that man should have got a
V.C.” And there were lots of others
almost equally revered.
At this time, when there has been such
abject retreat from responsibility by the
Government up for judgment, so much
capitulation to Communist brigandage,
it seems odd to recall that a Ministerial
representative, speaking of the Ambon
garrison, said:
We extol the gallantry and devotion of ffie
whole force. We honor the memory of those
who made the supreme sacrifice; and to
those who survived we pay due homage.
A nice tribute, but what have they to show
for it to their children? —Ci-Devant VX
(Vic.). .
Preference
“El Capitan’s” suggestion (B. 7/8/’46)
that ex-servicemen should deal only with
returned doctors, lawyers, dentists and
the like is plain nonsense. Why should
I change my doctor and dentist, who have
given me efficient and courteous attention
for 20 years, because they did not go to
the war? Apart from the fact that I
know one was too old to serve, and the
other not physically fit* it would be a
piece of impertinence on my part to pre-
sume that they had not good and suffi-
cient reasons for not enlisting. In any
case, whether a man was or was not in
uniform is no test of his service to the
nation or his claim to the goodwill of
returned men.
I know many lawyers, well on in years,
who visited army camps making wills
and giving legal advice to hundreds of
soldiers. In their offices they attended'
other soldiers under the Legal Aid"
Scheme, and carried on the practices of
younger men who had enlisted —all abso-
lutely gratis. I don’t regard their war
service as being in the slightest degree
inferior to that of lawyers who served in
the Army Legal Department or the Ad-
ministration section of the R.A.A.F.
Most civvy doctors in my State gave
a day a week at least, free, at public
hospitals as well as carrying on their own
practices and those of men in the ser-
vices. Why should a doctor, who per-
haps spent the whole of his service at a
well-staffed and well-equipped base hospi-
tal, have preference over them?
The majority of returned men are not
so one-eyed as “El Capitan,” In my ex-
perience, most of them have a faint con-
tempt for the man who puts “Late
A.1.F.” over his business premises.—
Junius Jr. (Q.).
Army Training
“Bondi Beachcomber” (B. 7/8/’46)
must have given very little thought to his
subject.
In 1942 the war had been “on” for a
couple of years in the M.E., and a driver
able to handle a truck in utter darkness
on the Palestine roads (generally mere
ribbons flanked on both sides by nasty
ditches) was a comfort. And if “B.B.”
had been attached to a frontline infantry
company in a fixed position he’d have
acknowledged the wisdom of burying his
spare petrol, and making some excava-
“Good heavens! There's the second pilot going after the first”
“Perhaps he'd forgotten something, dear.”
tion for his truck. The ability of drivers
to maintain convoy distance (in the black-
out) without getting lost, and deliver the
evening meals and ammo to R.Vs. that
were changed nightly with each advance,
was very much appreciated by the P. 8.1.
at least.
What “B.B.” means to say is: Why was
he trained for open warfare, then sent to
the jungle? Obviously, he was intended
as a “reo” for the Sixth, Seventh or
Ninth Divs., all of which had been in
actions depending upon skill in the phases
of the activities he derides. The Ninth
received reinforcements as late as De-
cember, 1942, and did not leave for home
until January, 1943. The decision to
bring that div. back then must have been
made suddenly, because, after the Aus-
tralians had been withdrawn from the
Alamein show, some units were warned
that they might be required further.
The urgency of the situation in 1942
precluded “B.B.” and his pals being re-
tained for the'jungle. Incidentally, where
were trucks used to cart supplies in the
N.G. fighting zones?— Cism (N.S.W.).
Samara!
Speculation as to whether the old
settlement at Samarai would be trans-
ferred to Milne Bay now appears to be
ended, in favor of Samarai being re-
tained as the port. No doubt transport
difficulties were a deciding factor —there
are not enough ships even to bring in
building materials from Milne Bay, 26
miles away, let alone transfer population
and commercial firms.
Most people are living in very primitive
conditions, and many complaints are
made about the insecure wharf. What a
pity somebody did not have vision
enough to allow the Americans to re-
build the wharf when they offered to, and
to take the equipment of the 1500-bed
hospital situated on the Cameron plateau
in Milne Bay! All that remained after
the bulldozers and flamethrowers had
done their work on the hospital were
the concrete foundations. Equipment
alone Would have supplied all hospitals
in both Territories. Am Tonus
(Papua).
A Loss
Leaving Australia next month with his
wife and family is a Dutch doctor
who, at one time, had hopes of settling
here. Ex-p.-0.-w. speak highly of his
skill and endurance under trying condi-
tions when he was the medical officer in
the Ambon camp. The difficulties of per-
forming operations without proper in-
struments and of treating disease under
Jap camp conditions did not weigh with
the Queensland medical authorities when
the doctor sought permission to practise
here.
As his qualifications were Dutch it
would have been necessary for him to
attend Queensland University for three
years to become eligible. Other con-
siderations apart, a wife and four children
to provide for would exclude this.
In return for services rendered to 500
Australian p.-0.-w., his case should have
been given some consideration. The loss
is likely to be ours, for, strange as it may
seem, there are many brilliant doctors in
other parts of the world who have never
heard of Queensland University.— Sea
Hawk (Q.).
An Empire Air Force
An Empire Air Force (B. 7/8/’46)
would get rid of the dreadful provincial-
ism which was rampant in the R.A.A.F.
in 1939, and would open the highest posi-
tions to Dominion men. Composite
Squadrons, some of which had men from
Britain, Canada, South Africa, India,
America, Australia and New Zealand,
were outstandingly successful during the
war.
With each Dominion running its own
air force there is no scope for promotion.
In pre-war days the R.A.A.F. worked five
days a week from eight to five and stood
down at about 3.30 p.m. on Fridays,
Generally there was never much done
after lunch.
The whole system hamstrung initiative,
and even the brightest recruits soon
settled into a groove. In an Empire Air
Force they would at least have the chance
of postings to other parts of the Empire,
where their outlook, minds and genera;!
knowledge would be broadened by con-
tact with other nationalities. —S. A. O.
(N.S.W.).
Commissioned Air-Crew
I appreciate the views of “456 Sqdn.”
(B. 7/8/’46) on the subject, but he is
wide of the mark in referring to C.G.Is.
as “five-week wonders.” To my personal
knowledge the majority (in fact 90 per
cent.) were veterans of the 1914-18 War,
in which they were either pilots or
observers.
Any applicant for commissioned rank
should have been through the ranks. The
main point 1 made was that not once
during their 10 months were air-crew in-
structed in the duties of an officer or
n.c.o. As all who graduated became one
or the other, it was plain stupidity on
the part of the Air Board. —C. G. I.
(N.S.W.).
Those Escort Officers
“456 Squadron” overlooks one import-
ant fact in his complaint that sergeants
were called upon to do mess and sanitary
fatigues in view of American privates
(B. 7/8/’46). Air-crew leaving Australia
for England were all n.c.os. and escort
officers had no other ranks to do fatigues.
As the care of quarters occupied by Aus-
tralians was their own responsibility, it
was customary to treat the whole party
as the same rank and share the work
equitably. The Americans did not pro-
vide fatigue parties to wait on our ser-
geants, so they had to pull up their socks
and do it themselves. I don’t think it
did them any harm.
I found my parties quite willing and
they certainly pulled their weight. I
warned them before leaving Australia
what they could expect. As the percent-
age of officers was exceptionally high, I
made it a rule that officers handled their
own personal luggage, while only the
heavy stuff which went in the holds and
baggage cars was handled by the rest. I
know of very few of the “five week won-
ders” who were appointed to escort duties
once the plan of using education officers
was discontinued—RECCO (N.S.W.).
Danger Pay?
About that ammunition dump found
at Rabaul. Because of the corrosion of
the bombs and torpedoes and the crystalli-
sation of the explosive, the ammo is in
a highly dangerous state. In fact, the
first, and so far only, load exploded in
the sea after it had been dumped. The
barge crew did not feel very cheerful
about that.
Apparently the job of disposing of
this ammo has fallen on the barge and
dock section of W.T. As many members
of this unit saw action in Borneo and in
New Guinea and have 15 months and
over of tropical service to their credit,
they had hoped to get home in a couple
of months. Now they are told that it
will take six months to complete this job.
Since the wharfies got danger pay for
loading safe ammo during the war, we
are wondering if their Government will
let these lads do this work for 6s. 6d. a
day and on a 70 per cent, tinned and de-
hydrated ration.—C. L. D. (New Britain),
The Postman and His Pay
Postmen are held in high regard by all
sections of the community, yet how many
consider the circumstances of their job?
They commence work not later than
6 a.m., and with odd breaks, seldom
finish before 4 p.m., often much later.
They are expected to be clean, tidy and
honest. Their reliability is essential to
the commercial and social life of the
community. In all their history they have
never resorted to stop-work meetings or
strikes. Right through both wars, when
many others received war loadings, special
allowances and other payments, the post-
man’s position remained unchanged ex-
cept for slight modification in the cost-of-
living allowance.
Few people know that, after the clean-
ing staff, the postman is the lowest-paid
member of the Commonwealth Public
Service. His maximum salary is £ll 7s.
a fortnight. Superannuation deductions
(averaging 17s. a fortnight to qualify for a
pension of £2 per week) and income-tax
cut it to £9 9s. Men who have
not reached the maximum salary are
drawing as little as £8 10s. net a fort-
night. Today the postman has become a
“breadliner,” and he believes he is en-
titled to something better.
Posties crowded the Princess Theatre,
in Melbourne, on a recent Sunday after-
noon to draw public attention to the in-
adequacy of their salaries. Although in-
vited, no politicians attended, but sent
their best wishes. Discussion revealed that
some of the gentlemen were “completely
surprised” to learn that postmen were
so poorly paid.—A. M. (Vic.).
Culture in Queensland
I doubt whether the decline of Schools
of Arts and similar amenities is due to
the development of modern transport (B.
31/7/’46). In several large Queensland
country towns I made particular inquiries
about local cultural activities. At War-
wick the School of Arts proved very
shabby, with an out-of-date library of
little value. I was told few people came
near the place. At Kingaroy, a pros-
perous farming centre, matters were even
worse, the largest part being used as a
billiard-room.
In Toowoomba I discovered a room
in the Town Hall where I found news-
papers, but little else of interest. There
wasn’t a soul to be seen. Near by is the
Returned Soldiers’ Club, with a good
library. Warwick and Toowoomba each
have a fine technical college and large
boarding schools. Summing up about a
dozen towns, most of them are keen on
singing and dancing, some interest them-
selves in choral singing, but the lack of
organised effort towards cultural appre-
ciation is only too obvious.
The blame rests largely with a State
education curriculum covering too many
subjects, with scant regard for aesthetic
training.' Certainly there is the influence
of trashy cinema films and “cheap”
literature. ! ’
The Queensland Government has re-
jected a Brisbane City Council plan
to establish 38 community library centres,
though a subsidy from the State Libraries
Board would have amounted to about
eight per cent, of the cost of the books.
As adult education classes in Brisbane
are overcrowded it is obvious that many
Queenslanders are anxious to extend their
cultural knowledge.— Dekko (Q.).


The Noose and the Lash
Readers of Sydney newspapers have
become so accustomed to reading the
daily recital of crimes of violence that
it takes quite a lot to shock them out of
their apathetic acceptance of such things
as part of the modern way of life. But
even to minds inured to stories of
cowardly bashings, criminal assaults and
other manifestations of the return of mob
rule and thug law to a supposedly civi-
lised city the brutal murder of a detective
in broad daylight seemed a piece of
wantonness that lacked any extenuating
circumstances.
There is provision in the Statute
Books of N.S.W. for capital punishment,
but in the last 30 years no “Labor” Gov-
ernment has permitted a capital sentence
to be carried out. A sickly sentimental-
ism that sees the most brutal criminal
as a victim of society instead of an
enemy to society and a sloppy idealism
that imagines evil can be abolished by
ignoring it are partly responsible for this
reluctance to hang a condemned mur-
derer, but the main reason is lack of
moral courage. “Labor’s” platform is
against the death penalty, and therefore,
however heinous the crime, however
brutal the murderer, a Labor Govern-
ment must commute the sentence.
The strange thing is that the rank and
file of “Labor” has no great objections to
a murderer being hanged. Non-Labor
Governments between 1932 and 1940 per-
mitted seven hangings. There was no
terrific outcry from the people; nor,
for that matter, was there any crusade
launched by “Labor” to save the
criminals from their fate.
Allied to this horror of the noose is a
horror of the lash, which is condemned
in “advanced” circles as brutalising.
When a Sydney Judge said if basher
thugs came before him for sentence he
would order floggings, he was assailed
in the press by “humanitarians” on .the
ground that flogging had a brutalising
effect on prisoners. Just how anything
could further brutalise a thug who with
two or three other bullies could delight
in knocking down an innocent man and
kicking hiqi into unconsciousness—and
this is the almost nightly pattern of rob-
bery with violence in Sydney—it is hard
to see, but woolly-headed idealists prob-
ably have an explanation.
No one wants to see a return to the
days when hanging was the penalty for
crimes that now bring a 40-shilling fine
and when the cat and the triangle were
the daily portion of any unfortunate who
looked askance at his jailer, but the total
abolition of the noose and the lash is an
open invitation to the dregs—or victims,
call them what you will—of society to
enjoy all the privileges of jungle law in
the safe knowledge that if caught a
“Labor” Government will see that the
sentence of the Court is not carried out.
—B. J. (N.S.W.).
Beef Tallow “Control”
Producers of all classes of beef tallow
are getting a bad spin under price-
control” regulations. Edible beef tallow
today is worth at least £l2O a ton in
London, but the fixed ceiling price in
Australia is £3O a ton and export is pro-
hibited.
Mixed (non-edible) tallow is worth
about £lOO a ton on the London market,
but before it can be exported soap manu-
facturers have to declare it surplus
to their requirements. Manufacturers
seem to have an inexhaustible demand
and, while tallow exports have been
kept to the bare minimum, soap ex-
ports have increased by many hundreds
per cent. This increased export trade
would be welcomed by tallow producers
if they were paid somewhere about world
prices for their product. They contend
that soap prices should be increased in
Australia to give them a fair price.
Edible beef'tallow is, of course, used
in making peanut paste, biscuits, table
margarine, household dripping and many
other foods. Here again prices should
be increased to enable tallow producers
to receive world parity. Otherwise they
should be allowed to export. The British
Government, desperately short of fats,
recently offered to increase by 100 per
cent, the price it had previously agreed
to pay for Australia’s exportable tallow.
Even this price would still be well below
that paid for Argentine tallow. But the
Federal “Labor” Government seems to
have singled out “primary producers” to
be the chief sufferers from price-
“control.”
Unless something is done to increase
the return from edible beef tallow there
will be an acute shortage, because what
tallow is available will be disposed of in
the non-edible stage. — Agric (Q.).
Fodder Conservation
City people often call the farmers im-
provident because they did not have suffi-
cient fodder reserves to see them through
the last two and a half years of drought.
What chance we had can be gauged from
my own case, which is typical of many.
The last opportunity I had of conserv-
ing fodder was in 1942. I was allowed
to sow a whole 150 acres of wheat. My
son, my only assistant, sowed 18p acres
and was immediately called into the
army. I then got notice that I had 30
acres of wheat sown beyond my “entitle-
ment” and that if I stripped it for grain
or cut it for hay I was liable to be fined
or imprisoned or both. Not very en-
couraging for conserving fodder. —
Double One (N.S.W.).
The Farmer’s Pay
I have just completed the income-tax
returns of a number of farmers. They
are all middle-aged men with families,
weatherbeaten and gnarled from hard
work.
The largest income earned by any of
them for the year was approximately
£350 ; but a number of them earned con-
siderably less. Weekly hours of labor
were 60 to 70, and members of their
families, including children, assisted.
I do not know of any other business in
which so much money and toil yield so
poor a return.
Most of these men are of normal in-
telligence, and must know that they could
earn as much on wharves or in factories
with half the labor and without risking
their capital. The fact that none of them
wishes to do so seems to indicate that love
“Someone pinched hat , missus—man must wear
sumpin'!"
of the soil is as deeply ingrained in these
men as it is in a European peasant.
When the younger generation has not
that love of the soil, it walks off the
land and seeks work in the city. It does
not do so because of the lure of the bright
lights, but simply and solely because in
Australia the land does not pay a decent
wage to the small man. Until this fact is
realised and remedied, the drift to the
city will continue.— Sol Brass ,(Q.).
Rubber Boots
Why is it that rubber boots, obtain-
able at most city stores during the war,
are now, with controls lifted, as scarce
as radium?
Mystified dairymen are also concerned
at the scarcity of rubber for machine
fittings. Manufacturers say there is a
shortage of linen wrapping. Yet during
the war when linen was even harder to
get no anxiety was caused by lack of
fittings for milking machines. — Plain
Australian (Vic.).
Cuckoo in the Nest
I represent the owners of a building in
Flinders-lane, Melbourne, which, in pre-
war days, was the hub of the softgoods
indent trade. Government departments
invaded us in 1944, and displaced tenants
were forced to find temporary space
wherever they could. The indent business
was slack at that time, so tenants were
able to make do with less space than
usual.
Now that imports are trickling back,
many of our ex-tenants find it almost im-
possible to carry on in temporary and
shared offices, and are asking for their
old premises. They assumed that Gov-
ernment tenancy would be a temporary
war-time affair, but they were sadly
astray. The building is to be taken over
permanently by bureaucrats. It’s a hard
road for the businessman. —Bozo (Vic.).
The Scot and the Jew
The Scot, like the Jew, has wandered
into all corners of the world. His de-
scendants, like those of Abraham, are to
be found in many countries. Both
races have proved their ability to reach a
more than ordinary share of high posi-
tions, and both have a shrewd sense of
money values.
People of Scottish origin also retain a
high degree of affinity. When two meet,
though thousands of miles separate their
homes, they exchange pleasantries on the
land of the heather. Although I have to
look back over 100 years ago to my last
Scotland-born forebears, I know my
blood would rise in opposition to any
persecution of the Scots in any part of
the world, just as Jewish blood the world
over bestirred itself when Hitler preci-
pitated his anti-Semitic crimes in Ger-
many.
The Scot sets the Jew an example.
He loyally adheres to the nationality of
the country of his birth or adoption, and
is everywhere accepted by fellow
nationals as an equal. He doesn’t set him-
self up as a homeless exile, as so many
comfortably-off Jews are doing, even in
Australia. There is a Scottish nationalist
movement, but only in .Scotland. It is
nothing like extreme Zionism, has no
terrorists and never will have any, —
K. Me. (N.S.W.).
The Professions
I am amused by “Friba’s” classing
architecture as one of the professions (B.
24/7/’46). I have heard of only four
recognised professions—the church, medi-
cine, law and arms, all of which have
codes of etiquette dating back to an-
tiquity.
Let me enlighten
“Friba” as to what
membership of a pro-
fession means. Mem-
bers of a profession do
not advertise or solicit
business, nor do they
engage in other occu-
pations. Moral fitness
is essential in the aspi-
rant to a profession,
and dereliction of duty
means expulsion. Pro-
fessional practitioners
do not act for or attend
the clients or patients
of brother-practitioners
without good cause.
Seniority is by years of
membership, and in all
conferences the junior
waits upon the senior.
Between brother-prac-
titioners, oral under-
takings are accepted
without thought of
writing, and it is the
etiquette of all profes-
sions that older mem-
bers assist the younger
by every means in their
power.
The basis of all pro-
fessional codes as
befits those who give
themselves to the spiritual welfare of the
community, the cure of the sick, the cause
of justice, or the protection of the nation
—is the brotherhood of the profession and
service to the community before personal
gain.
• f.s.d. is not my yardstick. But pro-
fessional men are entitled to expect ade-
quate remuneration for their services, and
to protest when their reward falls short
of that received by occupations of little
or no value to the community. The pres-
tige of a profession is something to be
prized, but it has been wisely said that
“It is extraordinarily difficult to pay the
smallest of accounts with the largest
amount of prestige.”— Professor (Q.).
Film Advertising
Now that films are being given more
advertising space in the newspapers, it
is interesting to note some of the catch-
lines. From one day’s advertisements:
“Love Made Her an Outlaw,” “Fiendish
Terror and Death,” “Death on the High
Seas,” “Murder in His Heart,” “Gun
Slinging Lady Killer,” “Can You Stand
This Horror?”
That some of this stuff is extravagant
and not supported by the film is not the
point. Psychiatrists should be interested
to note what advertising experts consider
necessary to draw people into cinemas.
Presumably the advertising is tried and
proven and it does make us look like a
lot of morons. —C. S. (N.S.W.).
“A Social Service State” s ,
I recently attended a lecture at which a
professor told me that I live in a Social
Service State. Having just borrowed the
money to pay my income tax I could
think of other descriptions. We have
the bureaucracy of socialism, but none
of its alleged security ; the uncertainty of
private enterprise, without its freedom.
Liberals stand for private enter-
prise, yet outvie their opponents in adding
socialist patches to the already motley
edifice of the State. Our one Liberal
Government builds houses in com-
petition with private enterprise, giv-
ing itself preference in materials. It
fixes rents more drastically against the
property owner than any Commonwealth
fair-rents court. It is now “nationalising”
Adelaide Electric Supply, one of the most
efficient private utilities in the country.
And yet the Playford Government will
unblushingly base its election programme
next year on private enterprise!
The hue and cry made by the Federal
Liberal party over the nationalisation of
airways is already dying down. If elected
in September, will the Liberals do any-
thing about it?
And what of Labor? It shrieks soci-
alism until it receives a mandate from the
people to give socialism a trial. Then,
overnight almost, it turns into a steady,
unimaginative, conservative party. Ad-
mittedly, a Federal Labor Government is
handicapped by the safeguards of the
Csnstitution, but State Labor Govern-
ments have no such excuse. On all sides
they can find industries which their
prophets claim should be socialised. But
not a finger do they lift.
Is there something wrong with soci-
alism? Perhaps the Labor party knows
it and won’t tell. Has private enterprise
gone bad since our forefathers built’ the
Empire on it? Perhaps only the Liberal
party has got wind of the smell.
The truth is that both parties lack the
courage of their convictions, and in the
meantime the people stew in “a Social
Service State.” — Proctor (S.A.).
The ’Drome at Wagga
The announcement that the Wagga
civil aerodrome (N.S.W.) is to lose its
licence because it is too close to the
R.A.A.F. aerodrome at Forrest Hill
makes one wonder if civil aviation is not
too safety-minded.
Wagga ’drome was used by the
R.A.A.F, to house a communication
flight, and by civil airliners right through
the war, when Forrest Hill was much
busier than it is now. It should still be
suitable as a commercial airport.
It seems most unfair to Wagga that
it should be deprived of its commercial
’drome. At least, it should be retained
until a replacement is found and pre-
pared.—Recco (N.S.W.).
“Educating” Brown Brother
Disturbing features of Papuans’ “edu-
cation” are becoming more noticeable.
Servicemen have been seen giving alco-
holic drinks to natives, and some of the
latter openly ask for beer or whisky.
Tribesmen who have been taught to read
and write specialise in getting jobs in the
stores, and shortages are causing worry.
Boys wear shorts under their ramis and
take small articles away. Larger par-
cels are handed to other boys with in-
structions loudly given in English, “Take
it to taubada’s house,” A few words in
dialect show the real destination.
Gambling is .rampant. Two-up and
poker, rarely played before the war,
are common now, with all the tricks of
double-headed pennies and marked cards
for the unwary.— Abi Tonus (Papua),
These Cynics!
Announcing his company’s plans for
the future, the managing-director of
General Motors-Holden’s said it would
produce a car “distinctly national in
character and designed to meet local con-
ditions.”
I presume it is fitted with a horn that
squeals and a body capable of fitting
easily into queues. -O T. (N.S.W.).
Publicity
What “W.K.D.” (B. 24/7/’46) calls
“the desire for publicity” has another
side to it. The signing of any work,
from a painting to an article, indicates
that the author is prepared to stake his
reputation and livelihood on his personal
belief in the value of his achievement.
Anonymity is often the cloak of inferi-
ority.
“W.K.D.” criticises the credit titles of
films, but would he favor the suppression
of actors’ names? To the film student
the identity of photographers and dir-
ectors is most important. And the an-
nouncing of names of those to take part
in a broadcast gives the listener an
opportunity to switch to another pro-
gramme.
In journalism, the competent writer
has nothing to fear. Sometimes contri-
butions to “The Red Page” may be
skimmed through, but the reader is too
wise to give that sort of treatment to
articles bearing the names of Norman
Lindsay, Cecil Mann or Douglas Stew-
art. There may be competent unsigned
music critiques, but in this country
musicians rely on the comments of
Neville Cardus.
In commerce, only the best goods are
branded. In other fields the author s
signature is his pledge of quality,
R. C. N. (N.S.W.).

THIS 9 • • The coming Liquor Referendum is not simply a
matter of deciding future hotel closing hours. It is a choice between
chaos and commonsense, convenience and inconvenience, restriction and
freedom. These are the real alternatives between which you have to
choose when you cast your vote.
It is 6 o’clock closing, and 6 o’clock closing alone 9 that is responsible
for the chaotic, inconvenient and restrictive conditions existing in N.S.W.
hotels to-day. Only by altering trading hours to 10 o’clock can we get
reasonable and moderate conditions, which will allow men and women to
enjoy a drink in quiet and comfort, in pleasant surroundings, at what-
ever time is most convenient. To give our State reasonable hotel amenities,
10 o'clock should be the new closing time. Remember, with 10 o'clock
closing, hotels will close between 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m.
