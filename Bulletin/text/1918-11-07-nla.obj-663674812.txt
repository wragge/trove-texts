Weakness
Every movement of the
body uses up a definite
amount of vitality. That
is why you feel tired at
the end of the day. When
you overtax yourself, or
when your vitality is
undermined by illness,
your whole system be-
comes too exhausted to
recover its lost vitality
without assistance. Your
system is like a plant that
is drooping for want of
water. And just as water
revives a drooping plant —
so ‘JWincarnis’ gives new
life and new vitality to a
weakened constitution.
Because‘Wincarnis’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.
It is a Tonic, a Restora-
tive, a Blood-maker and
a nerve Food—all in one.
Therefore

good. You can feel every

more strength than you
had before, and surcharg-
ing your whole system

is why over 10,000 Doctors

BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us Anxiety with its beauty-destroying, influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while peihaps a few the moie
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past and prospective events we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these. fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the bnthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
■ ■
A Beautiful Complexion by Natural Means.—
The secret of a perfect complexion lies in the
continual renewing of the outer cuticle of the
skin. This is Nature's own method. lhe
outer skin as it becomes coarse or shrivelled
must be removed, and an opportunity given
to the finer one beneath to show itself. It is
because the old, dead skin is allowed to re-
main on ♦ the face that so many women, and
even young girls, suffer from pimples,
blotches and sallow dull skins. To remove, by
absorption, the dead outer skin, and with jt
all blemishes, the use of mereolined wax is
universally recommended, ordinary face
creams being powerless for this purpose.
Smear the wax over the face and neck, rub it
gently into the skin, and leave it on all night.
In the morning w r ash it off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water, when all the dead skin
will be removed with the wax. Then apply a
lotion to prevent any trace of greasiness
being noticeable and to give a peach-like
bloom to the skin. A lotion to do this can be
made up quite cheaply from- the following
recipe: Take one ounce of cleminite and dis-
solve it in four tablespoonfuls of hot water.
Place in a bottle, and when cool apply to the
face with the fingertips, allowing it to dry on
the skin.
To Remove Blackheads. —Dissolve one effer-
vescing stymol tablet in a glass of hot water,
allow tlie effervescence to subside, then dip a
small sponge into the liquid and mop over the
face. Allow it to remain on for a few min-
utes, then wipe off with a towel, and the
blackheads will be entirely removed. To pre-
vent them from re-appearing, use a stymol
tablet in the manner described twice a week.
How to Shampoo.—Before shampooing the
hair dip the lingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil, and thoroughly massage the scalp.
Then dissolve a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. Fill a basin with warm
water into which the ends of the hair can
fall, and shampoo the stallax mixture into thn
roots in the usual way. Then rinse and dry
by fanning with a palm fan.
Grey Hair.-—To restore the color of grey or
fading hair, take two ounces of concentrated
tummalite, and mix it with three ounces of
bnv rum; apply to the hair for several nights,
using a small sponge, and the hair will grad-
ually resume its original color. When the
desired shade has been obtained, the tainma-
lite lotion should be used about twice a week.
Apply it to the roots with an old toothbrush
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K.).—To
whiten your neck, use jettaline. Get a tube
of this from the chemist: and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning-. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks, and you will find that
the skin will become beautifully clear and
white.
BABY.—You need not lose your pretty com-
plexion. Get a tin of mercolized wax, and
rub a little well into the face every night.
This well remove the dead outer skin and
reveal the' pretty fresh new skin underneath
Be careful what soap you use, as this is very
important. I should suggest Pilenta.
MATER.—To reduce yourself to your original
weight, get a packet of clynol berries and eat
four daily one after each meal and one at
bedtime. When once you have returned 1:o
vour normal weight you can discontinue
them,*as the cure is permanent and not merely
temporary, as so many others are. There is
no need to make any alteration in your diet.
DISAPPOINTED—T am not surprised that
you have been disappointed in your hair: you
are not using a suitable shampoo. Get a
packet of stall.ax and shampoo the hair every
fortnight with this. It - will make*lt soft and
keep it fair.
NELLIE—There is nothing more disastrous
to beauty than superfluous hair. In that you
are right, but you are wrong in thinking that
there is no permanent cure. Get an ounce of
powdered pheminol and a tube of tekko paste.
These two. used in conjunction, will perma-
nently remove the growth.
GERTIE. -The lotion to which you refer is
made as follows: Get an ounce of clemimte
and mix it with four ounces of warm water.
Allow it to cool, bottle, and dab over the face,
allowing' it to dry on the skin. This is far
superior to powder, and gives a fresh bloom
to the face without the appearance of make up.
MAISIE. —Yes. the longer your eyelashes the
larger and brighter your eyes will look. To
increase the growth of the lashes rub a little
mennaline into the roots every night. Do this
verv gently, but thoroughly, and you will be
delighted with the result. [2

The Red Page
Fleet Street
Ow'ing to the payer shortage freelance
journalism in Fleet-street lias lost much o>
its former glamor, but it still has its
moments. Space, the end of every journal-
ist’s desire, has become a metaphorical ab-
straction, like Time. Even the sacred ads.
are rationed. The swift historians of each
day who used to fling a world upon a page
now put it into a paragraph.
Albert Dorrington, who has been nine
years in London, and has nine serials to his
record (he counts them on his fingers with
justifiable pride), says that this particular
art-form that used to ornament nearly all the
daily papers has almost disappeared. These
shockers, divided into two main genres, the
domestic and tile romantic, were a recog-
nised stand-by of the freelance. They gave
him a steady job. Most authors have writ-
ten a few serials in their time, for a good
serial used to be worth £l5O, which is about
three times the value of an average novel.
The short-story field remains open, though
somewhat restricted, but the magazines are
sorry-looking things, with their small type
and poor paper. The prices are fairly good. In
a decent magazine even the unknown man
can get about £3 a thousand —a cent and a
half a word, which, of course, will do, though
it is below the New York standard for short
fiction.
But serials and short stories represent the
higher flights of the muse. There is more
excitement, if less profit, in chasing the
elusive guinea to its lair in the “great”
dailies. Before the war the freelance could
make something of a struggle with Fate,
though he usually came off second-best, by his
topical articles and pars. Reviews of other
people’s books used to be a popular form of
acquiring easy money, but at present the
outsider has but a poor chance of finding
such plums. To succeed in this line of
business a reviewer should try to become
friendly with an editor, meet him at a re-
spectable club, and, if possible, stand him an
occasional dinner.
The true freelance shoots his articles into
the slot and trusts to Providence. Prices
vary. The Daily Mail pays three guineas
for articles under 400 words, the London
record. In contrast, a par. that appears in
the “Office Window” of the Daily
Chronicle brings only half a crown. But
it hasn’t to be personally collected; it is
posted to you. A Star “Tea-Time Gossip”
is worth 'ss.: but for little sketches and
articles the Star pays a fair price, about
twice as much as the Melbourne Herald.
The old Globe has changed its tune. It is
as dull as ever, but it has become a trifle
frivolous. The celebrated guinea “turn-over,”
that paid for many a much-needed dinner,
has now gone, alas! with the snows of
yesteryear. The Pall Mall Gazette,
though reactionary enough in politics, has
lost its style and aristocratic appearance, and
appears chean in comparison with the
“Liberal” Westminster, which still retains
an academic atmosphere and delights in
Greek quotations. The Westminster not
only publishes but pays well for verse, a
rarity in journalism anywhere.
Frank Fox, who was wounded at the
Front, but ctill has as optimistic an outlook
as ever, thinks that after the war there will
be a great time for the younger journalists.
There will be new papers, new policies, new
everything: At present all things are sacri-
ficed to party politics. The reading public
has a poor choice, On the one hand they
have the Cocoa-press, supported to a great
extent by Quaker-Pacifists, well-meaning
men, but cursed by wealth and wowserism ;
-and on the other the shrieking gramophone
press, represented by Northcliffe, Rother-
mere and Beaverbrook —Philistine, jingo,
commercial, anti-democratic. These are
the papers that count, and both groups have
already started their campaign for the com-
ing elections. The Morning Post voices the
old Tory opinion. It is honest. It makes
no pretence to be fighting for democracy
against militarism. It likes militarism and
hates democracy. It regards Lloyd George
as a Radical. After all, this Toryism is
better than the cheap sensationalism of
Northcliffe-Beaverbrook, but it has no more
influence than the militant Labor press whose
day has not yet come but is certainly com-
ing.
G. Iv. Chesterton, who is editing the New
Witness for his brother Cecil, who is at
the war, pins his faith to the small personal
papers, that are not tied to any party,
brewers or wowsers, cocoa-kings or philan-
thropic soap-boilers, but maintain against
all comers an independent democratic atti-
tude. Chesterton said writers were con-
sistent, politicians were not. Five years
hence Kipling will not have become a
Little Englander, or Bernard Shaw an anti-
Soeialist. But nobody knows what a poli-
tician will be in five years. Lloyd George,
now the symbol of patriotism, was the lead-
ing pacifist 10 years ago. And our William
Hughes, once almost a Freetrader, how
turns up in Britain as the champion of
tariff-reform. Chesterton wants a number
of small, straight papers, in which men may
express their ideas freely. The politicians
have failed.
Yet, after all, there is more freedom of
opinion in London than in New York or
Melbourne. In the Labor Herald Lans-
bury, Brailsford and others say anything
they like. In the New Statesman and
elsewhere Bernard Shaw- publishes many
satirical articles. The Manchester Guar-
dian, a solid paper and more or less a sup-
porter of Lloyd George, published all the
secret treaties, dispassionately, but with use-
ful maps. Massingham, in the Nation, with
articles that show extraordinary knowledge
of the internal conditions of the Central
Powers; Colonel Reppington, with his bold
criticism of military policy in the Morning
• Post ; and Arthur Ransome, with his special
correspondence from Russia, openly and en-
thusiastically Bolshevik, in the Daily
News, would all receive short shrift from
our stern Catos.

THE PLANT IS SIMPLE, EFFICIENT and DURABLE.
ELCO-LIGHT consists of an engine, generator,
switchboard and set of batteries. The engine
and generator are direct connected, which does
away with any transmission losses or belt trouble, in-
creasing the efficiency of the machine. The storage
battery Ms-of the special Delco-Light type, consisting of
sixteen glass jar cells, delivering 32-volt current. Unless
the demand for light and power is very heavy, it is un-
necessary to run the engine, except when the storage
battery requires recharging.
Electricity is stored up in the battery by means of
the generating unit. Wires lead from the light and power
connections . to this storage battery, from which electric-
current is used as desired for light or power.
You will find Delco-Light to be a model of simplicity.
When it becomes necessary to re-charge the battery the
engine is started by merely pressing in on the starting-
switch located on the switchboard. This electrically
cranks the engine, just as the automobile engine is
cranked by an electric self-starter. The engine starts
running on its own power in a few seconds. It can then
be left to itself, as when the battery is completely charged
the Delco-Light engine stops automatically.
The supply of kerosene is regulated by means of
a simple lever-operated mixing valve. Moving the lever
to the right or left regulates the supply of fuel.
There is only one place to put oil. The crank case
is designed to hold about three quarts of oil, and a rapidly
revolving gear carries a fine spray to all parts requiring •
lubrication.
The reliability of Delco-Light has been proved through
actual service under trying conditions. It has been
thoroughly tested in every possible way, both in the shop
and in practical service on the farm and in the home.
Nothing has been left to chance. The tests have been
more severe than any service an owner would require.
For example, the machine has been run under
a full load for seventy days and seventy nights
continuously. It was then carefully examined and found
to show almost no wear and to be in excellent
working condition.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Spring 1918.
Come not again with lilac bloom,
With pink and white of oleanders,
Life’s ships, our ships, are piled in Flanders,
And Love has sailed to Port o’ Doom ;
Come never more with oleanders,
Or mockery of lilac bloom!
Come not with swallow-wings again,
With song of birds and wine of roses.
Somewhere in France young Joy reposes,
And Rumor’s blue-flies beat the pane;
Come never back with wine of roses
Or sweep of swallow wings again !
Come not with days of blue and gold,
By Galilee goes Mary weeping,
By Galilee for Christ long sleeping,
Pale dust in dust of Syrian mould ;
The fields of wrath are ripe to reaping,
Come not with days of blue and gold !
Come not with sign of golden-rod,
To wake again the magi seven.
Blind Terror walks the hills of Heaven,
The Judgment comes, but where is God? —
Come not again with fairy leaven,
Or laughing light of golden-rod !
Come not again, come not again,
And make a rapture for the lovers
With sheen of daisy-stars that covers
The dead men’s eyes upon the plain.
Romance is dead, and cold the lovers,
Come not again, come not again !

Ah, when you touch me, sweeps
To music every chord that sleeps;
But when you kiss, my blood
Springs like the sea-tides in their flood,
And all the emptiness of years
Clamors in crying at any ears,
And I am caught as jin a wind
That takes my breath, and 1 am blind—-am
blind!
Oh, I have hungered for you so;
Starved like a lost bird in the snow!
... .1 have known winds in desert places,
And seen the stars as frozen faces,
And. watched the large, relenting sun
Shield-widen as the day ivas done,
And seen the late bird turn to his own;
But I was alone, alone.
I teas alone in the heat, in the cold,
As a lamb that is strayed from her fold.
I have heard life like a voice in the night,
Lost like a light—a wandering light —
In the fen, in the mist;
And never a hand was there,
And no one to care —
Have hungered and striven,
And suffered unshrivOn;
Hungered for you
As the burned-up earth for the dew,
As the withering grass for the rain,
As the parching herb for the end of pain —
And followed the dream that was you to the
end!
Oh, I have hungered for you
As the strength in the tlieiv
For the quoit, and the axe, and the spear,
As the sap at the Spring of the year
For the pathivay of life in the tree,
As captive, the wing of the gull for the fetter-
less sea —
Have hungered, and dreamed, and held to the
dream
As a. light, as a gleam ;
And out of the darkness I came at the end —
At the end! —unbroken to you.
IVo cloud in a wan. wet sky
Has wept more than I;
And never a darkness of night, has seen
A dark like the dark where my soul has been.

The Old Days Were Better.
I’d be making a song for lovers of the young
wind stirring
The heart of the hedge till the night was a
bowl of scent,
And a moth from the green of the trees its
white flight whirring,
To the hand of the gipsying moon in her
silver tent.
I'd be making a song for lovers of the grey
dew weighting
The silk-soft grass on a way that loiters
along
By a stream that chatters and laughs to the
young trout mating,
Where’s the man could find better words for
a Springtime song?
I’d be making a song for lovers the wide
world over,
And the call of a nesting-bird would be thrid-
ding it through.
With the magic it holds bringing shame to
the four-leaved clover,
For where is the young man going knows
more of love than I knew?
By the little round hill ’tis many the time I
was walking,
Through the mist o’ the night with a girl in
the twist of my arm,
And she as still as a rose—sure, where was
the need to be talking.
When a kiss every now and again would be
keeping our two mouths warm?
I’d be making a song for lovers of berries
within the hedges,
And clouds on a windy sky with the warm
sun shining through,
Of a lone bird breaking his heart flying low
over marshy sedges—
There’s never a man among you knows more
of love than I knew.

AUSTRALIA ON A GOOD WICKET.
The British Government has announced that
its public debt up to date is £6,875,000,000,
and the Government notes to be re-
deemed will make the total somewhere over
£7,150,000,000. If the war ends shortly
it is roughly estimated that the country will
get out of the business with a debt of
£8,000,000,000. There are outstanding bills to
pay, and the repatriation account will be
enormous, for an army can’t simply be
turned loose and sent home to look for a
house and a job—it has to be dispersed
gradually and the process may last a year
or two. Then some of the occupied coun-
tries will have to be garrisoned for a while.
If they are allowed to drop into anarchy
after the manner of Russia there will be no
more hope of collecting indemnities from
them than from an overturned wasp’s nest,
and those that aren’t liable to anarchy
must be garrisoned to make sure that the
disarmament is real and not bogus. Of
course, unless some reversal of fortune comes
along, there will be the indemnities as a
set-off against the debts, but it isn’t advis-
able to reckon confidently on them. The
ravaged countries have the first claim—-the
claim for material damage—and after Bel-
gium, Northern France, Poland, Roumania,
Serbia and Montenegro have been put in
passable repair, and the indemnities already
collected from Roumania have been refunded,
the balance can be divided among the Allies
at the rate of as much as possible in the £
on their war charges. The collection of
indemnities will have to be spread over many
years, for no one can collect at any moment
more money than exists at the moment. So
the repayment of war charges can’t begin
for a long time, and how much in the £ it
will amount to, even with the best effort, is
quite uncertain. That enthusiastic Federal
politician who moved that no peace would
satisfy Australia unless it got all its war
charges refunded was almost as previous as
the ones who propose to elect a Labor
representative to the Peace Congress. Aus-
tralia is a country with no material damage
to show except the loss of a few ships; it
failed badly in the matter of supplying muni-
tions and food to the Allies; it didn’t lend
money to weaker Allies as Britain, France
and the United States did; and it didn’t
even find a reasonable proportion of its war
charges, but financed on the old man in Lon-
don for the most material part of them, and
to some extent for ordinary public works
to boot. So it isn’t exactly a first debenture-
holder or even a fixed depositor in the wind-
ing up: it is rather like a holder of deferred
shares. It may even be paid largely by the
surrender it on a valuation of German
Papua and some islands.
*.* * *
Therefore it is best to take the figures as
they stand. Britain’s debt is set down at
£7,150,000.000, or about £157 per inhabi-
tant. Australia’s debt, State and Federal,
was at the same date about £675,000.000,
including paper money not represented by
gold, and the new loan will make it about
£715,000,000 when the money comes in, or
£145 per inhabitant. At June, 1914, the
end of the last financial year of peace, Aus-
tralia, thanks to its wonderful public works
loan policy, was far more deeply indebted in
proportion to its population than Britain.
But it didn’t run the war policy on the
strenuous lines of “the last man and the
last shilling” as John Bull did, so it is
now the less embarrassed country of the two.
And Australia professes to have about
£384,000,000 worth of good public works to
show for its debt. Of course this is a lie,
but it certainly has £300,000,000 worth which
profess to pay interest on their cost, or
nearly so. That may be said to reduce the
debt to £415,000,000, or £B4 per head,
as against Britain’s £157, for in Britain
railways, tramways, water and sewerage
works, etc., are not State property. Nor
are there in Britain any unsold public lands
worth mentioning, and consequently there is
no land revenue worth mentioning. In the
circumstances it is reasonable to ask what
this country thinks of doing.
* * * *
Great Britain, despite the fact that it has
been drained almost twice as heavily as Aus-
tralia in the way of war taxes, proposes, as
soon as peace arrives, to start paying off its
war debt out of revenue. It has done this
every time peace arrived, which was fre-
quently. Over a century ago it found itself
with a debt of £900,000,000, or about £5O per
head of a very poor population exhausted by
20 years of war, and it promptly began to
pay off in the old, stolid, wooden, mechanical
way. It certainly won’t pfopose this time to
borrow from any other country, to float local
loans, to suspend the sinking fund, to carry
deficits forward, or to do any other shady
devices. Such things would be contrary to
precedent. Australia’s position at the peace
will be that it has a much smaller debt per
head to carry than the old father country,
and that if it has the courage to pay the in-
terest and sinking fund out of taxation, as the
old father does, and to swear off loans it will
have a net revenue of about £10,000,000 a
year from railways and other works and
about £2.500,000 from lands, with which to
pursue its public works policy. This should
he quite sufficient for the pursuit of a fairly
strenuous public-works policy, and as the
new works wouldn’t be cumbered by loans,
and their earnings wouldn’t be swallowed by
interest bills, every year would make the
position easier. Certainly there would have
to be a cutting down of the monstrous frills
of government—the vulgar, glaring extrava-
gances that look like the furnishings of a
newly-arrived multi-millionaire who has just
boualit a title and has forgotten to buy the
much more necessary aspirate. Under the
new order of things it would be essential to
struggle along with fewer Governors, aides-
de-camp, Upper Houses, assistant Ministers,
Boards of Shuffle and Inquiry that are
created to supply billets for Ministers’ lazy
and often thick-headed acquaintances, Com-
missioners of Trade, superfluous employees
in the gilded palace in London, Agents-
General, receptions to undistinguished visi-
tors, suppers for ditto, motor-cars for Minis-
ters’ female belongings to go joy-riding in,
Hansards and other unreadable matter,
bonuses on babies that never were born and
never expected to be, also imported clothes
and thick official stationery. The Minister
for Absence —that person, often a third-rate
solicitor with an accidental portfolio—who
is always away on full salary and heavy
expenses, inquiring into the cultivation of
snakes in Iceland, might have to be deprived
of his situation and told to work for his
crust. There would be a smaller edition of
the Government Gazette, with less white
margin and a less painstakine enumeration
of his Excellency’s titles, which really con-
cern no one save his Excellency. There would
be fewer Government Astronomers, so that
the stars would have to stagger along in their
orbits with diminished supervision, and in
general more piecework and less day work.
It might even be necessary to give up the
One Big Congested City policy and save
haulage on goods for export. Still there is
no real difficulty about the business.
* * * *
Everything depends on whether the Aus-
tralian chooses, or doesn’t choose, to regard
himself as a loafer and a person utterly
unfit to be entrusted with the problems of
self-government. He can’t ask for special
consideration in the way of the right to be
inefficient on account of the splendid valor of
his soldiers, for there were other soldiers
almost equally good whose countries didn’t
fail them so badly in the matter of supplies.
Nobody pretends that debt is a valuable
thing in itself, or that it is better to be
embarrassed than otherwise. The plea has
always been one of necessity, and the simple
figures show that there is no necessity. Com-
pared with Britain, and still more with some
of the other Allies, Australia will be on a
good wicket, and all wickets are comparative.
If this country, getting out of the war on
cheap and profitable terms, is found crawling
around its battered parent for accommoda-
tion. or if its Labor party is found crawling
round the despised local capitalist for accom-
modation, it can only be because it is a place
that has been pampered by loan money and
imported luxuries till it has forgotten how to
work, or' hasn’t learned how to get results
from its work. This is a good time for the
reconstruction of national ideals. Any time
is good, but this is better than usual.
THE AUSTRALIANS REGARDED AS
CANNON-FODDER.
Now that the great war is in its fifth year
there is abundant evidence on which to
return a verdict. The verdict is that, as
cannon-fodder (a term which includes offi-
cers as well as privates), the Australians
are among the very best that the world can
show. In an Alliance where courage
is so common that comparisons be-
came invidious, they have shone with a
special lustre. The Serbians, who take im-
possibilities as part of the day’s work, and
consume improbabilities for breakfast, are
no better. And yet when the record is
made up the Australians have been hardly
anything but cannon-fodder. The men who
went to the war were of the very best, while
those who stayed behind to manage the war
were among the worst. And neither those
who went nor those who stayed had shown
any serious realisation before the war of
their national responsibilities. The sum
total is miserable failure, gilded by
the splendid heroism of our exported raw
material. Even in the biggest crisis the world
has seen since Asia and Europe fought out
the question whether the white man or the
brown-yellow man was to inherit the earth
Australia stuck to the cowardly, Freetrade
tariff-sinking doctrine that its destiny is to
export raw materials and leave the finer
arts and industries to peoples with more brain
capacity. The question, so far as we were
concerned, which was put to the issue in
1914 was whether Australia should, or should
not, lose its nationhood, its name, it% Par-
liamentary Government, its trades unions,
its freedom to work for itself instead of toil-
ing on a sort of chain-gang after the fashion
of Belgian prisoners. And the country still
went on exporting meat —human meat—and
floating loans and disclaiming responsibility.
The habit of drawing parallels between
Australia and Canada arose because they are
white, self-governing dependencies of the
British Empire of about the*ame size and in-
volved m the same risks. They are in a
class by themselves. In the matter of men
to begin with, this country, by comparison,
failed abjectly, pitiably, miserably, shame-
fully. For every soldier at the Front there
is required at least one soldier in the rear
making munitions. If the soldiers at the
rear who build ships to carry the soldiers
and the munitions and the other supplies are
counted, much more than one for one is
necessary. If those who find food and
clothes and sundries for the men at the
Front—the men whp have ceased to be pro-
ductive —-are counted, it requires three or
four soldiers at the rear, or an extra, effort
equal to that number, to maintain one in the
battle-line. Australia has been 300,000
short, at a moderate estimate, in its quota
of soldiers in the munition-making business
alone. The 2000 or so that it recruited for
the making of weapons and explosives were
less than the hundredth part of the country’s
fair share. The Government runs war in-
dustries for the making of rifles, cordite,
clothing, etc., just about sufficient to give
its new recruits what is “wanted on the
voyage.” The year’s output would perhaps
supply the army with some —not by any
means all—of its essentials for a day. So
far, even though the value of the output is
reckoned at war figures, and there are no
bad debts or advertising or bagmen’s ex-
penses, the concerns don’t show a paper sur-
plus. With the- most friendly and kind-
hearted bookkeeping they revealed a paper
deficit last time the accounts were made up.
so they were something in the nature of
relief works and the employee got the full
product of his labor with a little thrown in.
Yet munitions are, in a sense, more import-
ant than the raw human material, inasmuch
as 100.000 fully-armed and -equipped men
are worth far more than 600.000 unarmed.
On that estimate the importance of the equip-
ment as compared with the meat is five to
one. There are few braver soldiers than
the Russian, and the Grand Duke Nicho-
las, though neither a Focii nor a Kitch-
ener for skill, was a good commander, with
all the courage of his race. Yet even he
sounded a note of despair when his big guns
were firing two shots a day or two per week,
and asked what he could do with soldiers
who had neither boots, rifles nor ammuni-
tion. Australia’s army would have been
worse than that if it had had to depend on
its own supplies, like Russia.
The failure to furnish food and ships and
even wages for-our troops was as bad as, or
worse than, the failure to furnish munitions.
J. Bull has paid our army in the field, for
our gold supply has long been insufficient to
meet the interest on old peace-time foreign
debts, and to cover the balances due on
imported clothes and food and luxuries, and
Australian paper currency has no value out-
side the Commonwealth. J. Bull paid and
Australia owes the money. He also found
the appliances of war without which our
army might better have stayed at home out
of the way, and he found most of the ships,
and the money which bought the rest of the
ships. Because of these things thpre were,
on a moderate computation, half a million
more workers than might reasonably have
been expected left available in Australia for
ordinary peace jobs—half a million more
than there would have been if this country
had supplied an army instead of furnishing
a small fraction of an army in raw 7 human
material or cannon-fodder and a large frac-
tion in lOU. To make the real army would
have involved harder work, longer hours of
work, more skill, the use of better appliances,
the cutting off of a thousand Government
frills and Bureaux of Somnolence and Cir-
cumlocution and Imbecility, and the making
for ourselves of a thousand things which
we could no longer afford to import at war-
prices. But by cutting down the number of
persons employed in agriculture and manu-
factures, by floating high-priced loans for
peace purposes in England till the old man’s
patience gave out, by pawning the undeliv-
ered wheat and beef, and by lavish issues of
paper notes and paper securities it was actu-
ally possible for the population to do less
ordinary work (in addition to neglecting
war-work) amid the hurry of strife, than it
used to do in times of tranquillity. In fact
there was a general tendency to reduce work-
ing hours and to go slow in the hours that
remained. And, meanwhile, the community
has been paying itself big paper war divi-
dends. It is raising 150,000,000 per annum
in war loans and adding, in the form of war-
bonds, £80,000,000 per annum to the nominal
wealth of the community. The great bulk
of the money has to be spent here, though
there is no war here, for our paper money
can’t be spent anywhere else. It goes in
pay for soldiers who haven’t started or who
have returned, in deferred pay for men at
the Front (deferred pay is paper, but pay
at the "actual Front is coin), in war pen-
sions, payment of war and other officials, in
buying land for returned soldiers, and a
very very little of it in the making of
munitions. The note issue has been run
up to a far higher figure, in proportion to
population, than that of Britain, so assur-
edly no chances have been lost.
* * * *
The war, in fact, conducted on the simple
principle of owing the outside liabilities and
printing paper “wealthto cover the local
ones on a most liberal scale, is showing big
profits for the time being. Heaven only
knows what the country would have done
without it —that is to say, if it had been a
mere onlooker. The blessed strife is yield-
ing about twice as much as all the gross
earnings of all the seven Governments’ per-
manent and reproductive works puts to-
gether. Certainly the paper dividends have
been largely counterbalanced by losses, be-
cause a paralytic folk who didn’t know how
to build ships, or were too tired, let a vast
and profitable export trade go to the dogs
just when the chances were brightest. And
they have been counterbalanced by incon-
veniences in the shape of a scarcity of im-
ported goods, also arising out of ship fam-
ine. These drawbacks were inevitable, for
the rich importers and the Labor tariff-
sinkers have built up a combined gospel to
the effect (1) that the Australian is an idiot
who can’t do anything except the rough
work of supplying raw materials; (2) that
he is a pampered god who can’t be expected
to live on mean local food and wear miser-
able local clothes like an ordinary human
being. But if the splendid war dividend
hadn’t been there, and the country had
struck the ship-famine and the other troubles
as a neutral, without any £40,000,000 war
loans to scatter, the position would have
been dreadful to think of. And it is more
dreadful to think of what it will be when the
war dividends stop—for even the most
brazen Government can hardly go on raising
war loans when there is no war —unless Aus-
tralia has learned some lessons in hard self-
reliance. For, because of the great work
of repatriation, the famine in foreign ships
is likely to last for a long time after the war
dividends come to an end. And then some-
thing may have to be done in the way of
reducing the note issue, and the bill for our
soldiers’ pay in Europe will have to be
considered, and the drought is apparently
due again, and the gold output still decreases,
and the One Big Union folk are just getting
into their stride. *
Still, in all the dreary category of inepti-
tude, loafing, cowardice, shirking, extrava-
gance and childish muddle there is one
supreme redeeming feature. The raw
material which this country sent abroad has
put up a magnificent record—magnificent
beyond expectations. Australia as a whole
may stand out as the most incapable of the
great communities which went into the war.
If may be marked down as almost the only
white community of any size which is unfit
for complete self-government (i.e., indepen-
dence) seeing that its ideas of defence by
its own resources have hardly got beyond the
aboriginal scheme of relying on personal
valor. Its civilisation may be regarded as
a joke, seeing that so much of civilisation
consists of knowing how to do things—not
how. to owe for them. But the glory of Aus-
tralia’s. cannon-fodder will live in history
until history grows so old that its memory
and its front teeth give out.
INFORMERS AND MAKERS OF
MISERY.
The informer is a permanent institution,
and very old. It is a mistake to call
Rahab's the oldest profession in the world,
for that of Titus Oates was older. The
earliest mention of it appears in the out-
skirts of Genesis, when Adam informed on
his wife, and she turned State’s evidence on
the poor old serpent. They were casual folk,
but they laid the foundations of a great
industry. The informer, in a higher state of
development, was a discoverer of plots
against terrified kings, especially those with
weak titles, who were willing to pay for
safety and were too much scared to be care-
ful about details. He was also a purveyor
of the same class of goods for worried repub-
lics. The supply of real or at least provable
plots being scarce, and the ransacking of
the houses of suspects for evidence being
precarious and dangerous, the informer, in
slack times, made his own conspiracies,
selected his own conspirators among pro-
bable people or people with easily-copied sig-
natures, buried the compromising documents
in a paddock or a cellar ready to hand, and
then went ahead with the business. He
pushed his industry in all sorts of lines.
When English Jacobite or French Rovalist
schemes were saleable he supplied the market.
He furnished the Terror with the names of
lukewarm Terrorists. When heretics were
quoted in a rising market he discovered so
many that even the Pope began to be sus-
pected of Primitive Methodism. Later a
demand arose for witches, and at the Calvin-
ist city of Geneva 500 were burned in three
months to go on with. It was a case of
demand and supply, and suppliers created
the demand. The individual who informs
the worker about his wrongs, when he is a
person who lives on the game, is in the same
old category. He gets limelight, advertise-


ment, money and political advancement out
of his profession. Unfortunately he is often
a person of narrow intelligence, for any otne
kind is pushed out of the game early, and
the wrongs he discovers or invents are not
the big and very genuine ones, but those
that his limited mind is equal to. Tlieretoie
he can see a vast grievance winch justifies
the suspension of one of the biggest public
industries of the continent in the refusal ot
the nation, through its representative, to be
blackmailed for a free railway ticket tor a
petty official, or can lash himself and his tol-
lowers into fury because a Minister, says
that the publicly-owned shipbuilding indus-
try is doing splendidly though some ot the
employees had begun as "raw hands. And
the utterly rotten state of the finances, the
steady drift towards bankruptcy, the decay
of industry, and the fact that most of three
big States are becoming depopulated are
affairs that don’t move them in the least.
These are big things, and even if he
wanted to be moved by them, .which he
doesn’t, they are beyond the capacity of men
with the witch-finder’s capacity.
* * * *
Altogether too large a section of the com-
munity lives on the popular misery, and
if the misery doesn’t exist it has to be in-
vented or created. If work was as abundant
here as it is, for the time at least, in some
strenuous, high-tariff countries which have
doubled or trebled or quadrupled the output
of their industries by taking advantage of
the war opportunities, so that labor has be-
come a commodity to be bought at famine
prices, there would be a poor job for the
reformer who clamors for a living wage and
defines it as the figure at which a worker
may go slow for short hours and live chiefly
on imported goods to the rich importer’s
profit. He would be out of the picture, like
the man who denounces negro serfdom in
Melbourne or the lack of woman suffrage
in Sydney. So the talkers who have secured
control of the Labor movement make every
effort to prevent industry. They, are Free-
traders. sinkers of the fiscal issue, and
importers’ hacks. They are upholders of the
day-labor fetich, for piece-work gives oppor-
tunities for energetic men to rise out of the
ruck of the oppressed and discontented. The
kind of community which would be fatal to
their occupation would be one in which there
was a vast mass of highly-paid, highly-skilled
workmen; and where new industries were
arising so fast that every energetic man had
a chance to start on his own. and would
throw a clod at the voluble individual who
insulted him with his pity because he. was a
“wage slave.” In such a community the
building not only of new houses, but of new
cities, would be comparatively easy, and
nobody could make money by heaping up
adjectives concerning the miserable state of
society which compels seven people to sleep
in a top room in a city which holds nearly
half the State’s population and nearly three-
fourths of its manufactures and its shipping
industry. The most obvious inference is
that the men who make the biggest noise in
the Labor motement want seven or ten
people to sleep in a room so that, their stuffi-
ness and lack of cubic space may make them
recruits for a revolution which, it is hoped,
will put these same men on top. Ten people
in a room make something for the informers
to inform about. If they wanted less people
in a room the decentralisation plank in the
Labor platform wouldn’t be so completely
ignored. Also it is a fair inference that
these same plausible leaders want national
insolvency and chaos so that there may be
great chances for loud-voiced, loose-mouthed
dictators and repudiationists among the
ruins. Otherwise it is difficult to. account
for the disappearance of that beautiful anti-
borrowing plank which used to be so con-
spicuous.
* * * *
Nobody can live on being a friend to the
poor and a champion of the oppressed unless
there are people who are poor and oppressed
or who can be made that way or brought to
feel that way. It is the business of the pro-
fessional informer to inform the community,
or whoever else is paying for information at
the moment (it may, of course., be .a king or
an oligarchy or a church), of imminent dan-
gers from capitalists (State or private),
witches, Jacobites, heretics and sundries.
These dangers have to exist, or to look as it
they existed. The supreme outrage that
could be committed on the land monopolist,
say, in N. S. Wales, would be the creation of
two or three new Sydneys with the commu-
nity as sole ground landlord and inheritor of
the unearned increment. It would also be a
supreme outrage on a certain class, of re-
former, seeing that he would lose lus text.
His interest lies in preventing improvement
being made by anybody save himself, and m
subtly aggravating public calamities so that
he will stand out the more conspicuously as
the indispensable dictator who is to put
everything to rights. If he hasn’t the least
idea how to put things to rights he. may at
any rate become a dictator. So it is in the
natural order of things that Australia’s
“Direct Action” crowd should be shoving
the country steadily down hill. It is bitterly
hostile to Australian production, and especi-
ally to that form of production which gives
the capable worker a chance to rise. It
plays the game of the foreign cheap-labor
man with its tariff-sinking policy, and loses
no opportunity to inflame its listeners
against everybody who endeavors to found
a new Australian industry. It props, up the
big city land-monopolies by ignoring its
alleged decentralisation policy. . It loses no
chance to pile up hopeless liabilities with its
loan devices. It favors strikes rather than
industrial arbitration, because in strikes
there is the germ of civil war. It denounces
State enterprise as well as private enter-
prise. including the Commonwealth Bank
a well-ordered institution which makes large
profits for the people and shows how things
can be done without the aid or interference
of the official Makers of Misery. There is
nothing in the Commonwealth Bank for a
sensational informer to inform about, which
is a serious grievance. To put it shortly,
there is a fairly influential section —influ-
ential much beyond its numbers —which
hopes to set up in business as professional
revolutionaries if things remain bad enough,
and especially if it can inform the people
that affairs are rapidly becoming worse.
Naturally they endeavor to keep them bad
and to make them worse.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Upside-down Government.
A good many things are happening these
days to bring our native land into disrepute.
The people of Australia should be proud of
their country, but apparently they aren t,
save in the way of stereotyped blither about
“wonderful natural resources.” The fact
that, on the first day when the supply of
other people’s ships ran a trifle short and
the country was called upon to show a trifle
of self-reliance, it proved to be pitiably in-
capable hasn’t moved any visible section of
the community to shame—not to visible
shame, anyhow. A new evidence of futility
appears in the latest Federal building regula-
tions. Under the War Precautions law
nobody, save by special permission, is to con-
struct a tramway, tramway building, ifaai'ket,
market-building, club, library, art-gallery,
hotel, hall, etc., nor do alterations to any
such place except to the extent of £250.
(Churches, curiously enough, may be built to
the extent of £lOOO without any special per-
mission, though the urgent need of more of
these edifices is very doubtful.) This sudden
and violent prohibition of industry doesn’t
arise through want of money. There never was
so much money in the country before, though a
lot of it is only good for local purposes.
There is enough of it to build another Aus-
tralia, so far as man and not God has done
the work, with all its improvements ranging
from a cathedral to a cowshed, for'a million
pounds spent on local material, local wages,
locally-produced food and clothes and the
like goes round so fast that it is equal to
paying for 20 million pounds’-worth of work
in a year without turning a hair in the pro-
cess. The prohibition doesn’t arise, either,
through scarcity of labor. The Australian
worker toils for shorter hours than most
other white people, and the go-slow policy is
industriously preached lest too much work
should be done inside these hours; and piece-
work is objected to lest it should hurry on
work even though it might lead to higher
wages; and there is even a demand for reduc-
tion of hours, so as to spread out the work.
The trouble can’t possibly be traced to lack
of materials. There are three square miles
of Australia to furnish materials for every
five persons, including infants, and that should
be sufficient. So presumably the difficulty
lies in the lack of imported materials and
imported ships to bring them here. Even the
brown heathen on a coral isle or the black
heathen in Central Africa can furnish him-
self with a weather-tight home or royal
palace or council hall without imported
materials, though of course it may be pleaded
that his style of architecture wouldn’t suit
us. But the overcrowded man of any Euro-
pean nation worth mentioning can pile up
modern structures, some of them better than
anything Australia possesses, out of his own
natural resources, except of course while
Huns and such-like are in possession. So
the Government advertises once more that
this country is unique in the way of helpless-
ness and incapacity. If all the world was
like it most kinds of work would be sus-
pended pending the arrival of galvanised-
iron, etc., from Jupiter. Its importers, and
their Freetrade agents in Parliament and
the press, have taught it that it can’t make
things because its people, being an inferior
sort, don’t know how. Its I.W.W. industrial
leaders have taught it that it shouldn’t make
things if it can possibly avoid the business,
because to do so is to be a degraded “wasre
slave.” And its loan-mongers have explained
that it doesn’t really need to make things,
for the good old loan will always fill a gap.
The Government lacks the courage to inter-
fere with the importing disease or the loan
disease. But it has done its bit by putting
a ruinous tax on new local industry. And
it now does its bit again by prohibiting a
considerable amount of local industry. Last
year it permitted £470.000 to leave the coun-
try (gold, of course, for the man whom the
importer represents doesn’t take our notes!
to pay for hat ornaments, and over £3.000.000
for silks and satins, and £410.000 for jewel-
lery, and £157,000 for perfumery. Also
£1.200,000 went in payment for spirits, but
perhaps the community needs an occasional
drink to drown the recollection of all these
silks and hat ornaments. It is an upside-
down sort of Government, like an acrobat
walking on his hands.
The Board that is a Gangway to
Nowhere.
The fact that the Board of Trade —one of
the costly frills beloved of the Hughes Gov-
ernment —still lives and hangs round from
10 to 4, or thereabouts, in its well-furnished
office and draws its pay, is proved by the
fact that Watt is in communication with
the gilded object. The problem before the
Acting Prime Minister when this fact came to
light -was that, while the competition of im-
ports was reduced by high war freights and
other conditions, sundry industries have
sprung up in Australia, but that these have
no permanency. So he was asked what was
to be done to prevent them springing down
again when the special conditions are over.
The industries in question are certainly very
few (even including Government war indus-
tries, which don’t need to pay their way,
having the taxpayer and the loan funds
behind them), for the War Profits Tax was
specially devised in the importers’ interests
to prevent them. And they certainly haven’t
sprung very high. Still, Watt was asked
about them, and he said, with the air of a
man who didn’t think it mattered much, that
there was a sort of desire that the scrappy
industries which have arisen shouldn’t be
killed off. The fact that there is an urgent
need for them to grow much bigger and for a 1
thousand new industries to start, unless this 1
country hopes to live on the loan disease for :
ever, wasn’t even mentioned. The most that
Watt admitted was that it was possibly to
be wished that the few precarious little new
enterprises shouldn’t flicker out unless they ;
have flickered already, and he seemed tired
and languid even about that. The matter, it
appeared, had been “under consideration
from several aspects” (he spoke as if it was 1
under ground or under dark suspicion), but
he didn't mention any of the aspects. One
might think that, when it was owing to the
fact that the tariff barrier being accidentally
raised by war-freights, etc., that the new
industries sprung up a permanent raising of
the barrier might give them confidence to
spring morebut Watt didn’t appear to
notice this. In fact, he didn’t appear to
notice anything definite, and his general
attitude was that industry was a good sort
of thing, like abstract virtue or perspective
or comic sections, but that it wasn’t really
important. Anyhow, it transpires that the
Board of Trade has been consulted about it.
The Board is an estimable elderly backwash
with a safe salary. It is outside the hustle
of life and competition. It wasn’t elected by
the people for any specific purpose; rather
it was appointed quite apart from the people
for so many hazy purposes that it has no
purpose at all. And why the most vital in-
terests of the nation should be delegated to
this maundering bureau passes understand-
ing. It is sufficient effrontery on its part
that it is a stipendiary parasite without add-
ing insult to injury by messing up the
nation’s business. It isn’t a live concern.
If it was it wouldn’t be a wooden Board ; it
would be something useful.
The Encouragement of Boose
Eloquence.
Acting Prime Minister Watt, talking to
the House of Reps, the other night:—
I have studied closely the resources of Australia.
The study will convince anyone that Australia
should not in any way be discouraged by belief
that she cannot support the indebtedness imposed
upon her. Australia is still a very wealthy country,
with a wealth that is mobile and a credit that has
extended in an extraordinary way.
Talk of this sort may reflect sense or fool-
ishness, according to where it comes from.
In the case of Watt there is yet no evidence
that his studiousness has shown him any-
thing more than has been revealed to students
of the Holman and Scaddan type. It has
always been open to any fugitive politician to
make long, rambling observations about Aus-
tralia’s “resources” and “wealth’’ and
“buoyant credit” and all the rest of it. In
the main these remarks have been right
enough. But it happens that their invariable
purpose has been to give an excuse for rush-
ing round to Cohen and entering into nego-
tiations for putting a blister on the afore-
said resources and discounting the credit of
the kid. The result is that Australia has been
heavily mortgaged, and that for at least a
substantial portion of the numerous ad-
vances there is no visible asset, and for a
fair part of the remainder there is nothing to
be detected except holes in the ground at
Canberra, the records of the Norton
Griffiths episode and the reports of various
Royal Commissions and Auditors-General.
It is quite likely that Australia can be
pawned some more. It is absolutely certain
that, if Watt and other Treasurers and Aus-
tralia’s 14 Houses of Parliament persist in
borrowing their way through on the old lines
in search of further prosperity, they will land
the country in inextricable disaster. The
latent wealth of Australia is almost immeas-
urable. It is at least equal to that
of any country on earth. Because
of this the boosting politician and the profli-
gate Ministry have had an easy time during
the last 20 years, while the rest of the world
was getting rich and money to burn was to
be had for the asking. But it is the purpose
for which the resources of Australia are
employed and the manner in which the
“wealth” of the country is used that are
going to count now. The p.n. that raised a
million last year is going to be no use to the
populace to-morrow. The wool and wheat
and meat and metals sold last week are not
available for selling again. The worn-out
imported boot and the incinerated cigar
would not realise 24d. a gross at an auction-
sale. Nor will the industry that never
started give a solitary individual opportunity
to mobilise any more wealth on the premises
than he annexed before. The important ques-
tion is : How do Watt and other students of
the situation propose that Australia shall
support the debt—how set about appropriat-
ing the wealth concealed in the boundaries of
the Commonwealth? It is no use telling the
community not to be “discouraged.” The
brutal fact is that the burden on the country
is stupendous, and that unless there happens
to be a very material increase in the produc-
tion of wealth and a mighty big change in the
distribution thereof, Watt and his friends
can lay very long odds on getting into colli-
sion with quite a lot of trouble, for the job
of carrying the load is not going to begin
and end with dropping phrases about. For
years Australia has been throwing wealth
away by handing it over to the outsider,
missing opportunity, living on the proceeds
to be derived in advance from the industry
to be started later on. So it is up to Watt
to explain what he is going to do. If he
entertains vague yearnings after another
crop of wild oats and a further era of waste
and shirk, he will be giving Australia about
as much encouragement as a mouthful of
strychnine imparts to a rabbit.
The Sunken Fund.
In an off-hand tone, like one who brushes
away or explains away a fly for the benefit
of persons of minor intelligence, N. S.
Wales Treasurer Fitzpatiuck explained the
State’s “Sinking Fund” the other night.
When there is a surplus (after paying for a
bouquet for a singer and a supper to an
opera co. and the cost of opening the Zoo)
£350,000 a year is sinking-funded towards
the repayment of the public debt. Which
isn’t exactly correct. When there is a sur-
plus of £350,000 or more the payment is
made or is supposed to be made. Other-
wise the payment is less. When there
is no surplus, which has been the
case ever since 1014, there is no payment,
or rather the payment is made and the Com-
missioners of the Fund hand it back. On
top of this, and despite all these appearances,
there isn’t any Sinking Fund at all, unless
some old small rare loans, in which it was
a condition of the prospectus, still survive.
The essential feature of a Sinking Fund is
that it accumulates persistently till it over-
takes its object. If it applies to one loan, a
sufficient amount is invested every year at
compound interest to pay the loan when it
falls due. If it applies to the whole debt,
a fixed amount is invested every year at
compound interest to be accumulated till it
overtakes the debt. The taxpayer gets no
relief from interest-paying till the last
moment, and then he gets relief from the
whole burden. (This has never really hap-
pened yet, but there are Sinking Funds in
the world which are chasing the debt and
have some hope.) The N. S. Wales Fund
is a lie and a cheeky swindle and an impos-
ture, like almost everything else in Aus-
tralian finance. The State borrows, say,
£3,500,000 in a year—perhaps £1,500,000
being for works which should, in any but a
Land of Financial Lies, be charged to
revenue. It does, or does not, pay £350,000,
or less than a quarter of the swindle, to the
Sinking Fund. This money and any frag-
ment of interest*is used presently to buy up
public securities. Instead of the securities
being held by the Sinking Fund Commissioners
and the interest collected and accumulated,
they are simply wiped out to relieve the tax-
shirker. It would be better if there was no
Sinking Fund, seeing that the contribution
isn’t always paid, and, say, £1,150,000 of loan
money instead of £1,500,000 was stolen for
revenue purposes. A real Sinking Fund of
£350,000 a year accumulated at 4 per cent,
would pay off a debt of 53-J- millions at the
end of 50 years. A bogus Sinking Fund that
is stolen or diverted at short intervals might
make the debt 17i millions less at the end
of 50 years, if the contribution was regularly
paid—or it might not. When £350,000 is
used every now and then to extinguish a
bit of old' debt it really makes it easier to
borrow £450,000, and hi the Land of Finan-
cial Lies that is usually done. The real
Sinking Fund would have an annual income
of over £2,000.000 a year from investments
at the end of 50 years, and even if revenue
contributions were stopped that would auto-
matically make the fund £100,000,000 in
another 17 years. The N. S. Wales variety
o p Sinking Fund would have no income at all
at the end of 50 years. Fitzpatrick says
proudly that the Ma State has paid
£3,879,403 into the Sunken Fund since its
establishment 14 years ago. He also says
that there is only £105,000 in the Sunken
Fund now. There is some £70,000,000 more
debt than there was 14 years ago, and the
£105.000 Fund is a very small dog to send
after such a big elephant. Especially as the
elephant is getting miles further ahead every
day.
*
House Paralysis.
The position of N. S. Wales as a great State
which has forgotten how to build a house to
put itself in becomes grotesque. It isn’t
the only state in this situation, but it is the
most aggravated case. Thus Wagga, where
the old Tichborne Claimant sold meat, pub-
lishes a special wail to the effect that there
have been as many as 40 applicants for one
empty domicile. Yet Wagga is rather a small
town —population a little over 6000. It
isn’t growing fast owing to wheat boom, gold
boom, diamond boom, munition works, any
other kind of works, rush of shipping, or
military encampment. The Iluns haven’t
set it on fire and reduced the accommoda-
tion. It is just a decent, quiet old spot with
one human to the acre, suffering from the
general Australian disease of house paralysis
or atrophy of the tenement. There is in-
terest in speculating on the cause of the
trouble. It doesn’t arise from lack of space;
Australia has more space to the square mile
than any other white man’s country on earth.
Nobody can charge it to lack of materials;
there is the entire globe for a foundation, and
all the “boundless natural resources” for the
walls and roof. It is impossible to imagine
lack of labor. In any issue of a Sydney or
Melbourne daily can be found as many allu-
sions to “the workers” as a London daily
contains in a week, so workers must be
abundant enough. Also the One Big Union
party demands that the working day should
be cut down to six hours, so as to make the
jobs go round. As for money to build with,
there is twice as much money of one sort
and another, including State and Federal
loan money and savings certificates and £lO
bonds and Federal notes, in the country as
there was before the war. In addition to
all this, the population to be housed is less
than that of a few years ago. The departure
of soldiers for the Front is one cause, and
the consequent drop in the birth-rate is
another. A number of reasons for home-
scarcity are suggested. Certain rushing
Solomons passed’ legislation by which an
expensive tribunal was founded to reduce
rents, and every £ taken off rents costs about
The Sign.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The day has passed when we can feel anxious as
to the future. To-day the great fight is won.”
—Governor Davidson (N.S. W.).
The fear of the fear is gone,
The whips of the strong are broken;
And the world moves on
With a child’s laugh for token.
The old men talked as they would
Where they sat in the high places;
And the young men died as they could
With an old pain on their faces.
Foot to foot were they met
In the valley of no returning,
The armies with blood to sweat
’Mid the death fires burning.
This was the cause of the fight:
Shall the world stand for the fearing
Of the doom-darkness of night
Or the morn’s appearing V
This was the cause of the hate:
Shall the world follow after
The death that the old men wait
Or a young child’s laughter?
This was the cause of the shame:
Shall the world stand for the knowing
That age to age makes the same
Wild blood-sowing?
But the fear of the fear is gone,
The thrones of the strong are quaking:
And the world moves on
To the white dawn’s breaking.
And this shall stand for a sign
After the hating and slaying:
We have won in the sun’s shine
A space for the children’s playing.

6s. Bd. in tribunal. In their haste the flying
Solomons made no corresponding reduction
in the price of borrowed money. Rather they
increased it greatly instead of leaving off the
loan habit. Now, a Government debenture
never gets its window broken or its roof
blown off, and it is never burnt to the
ground. It isn't subject to bad tenants,
spells of vacancy, white-ants, land-tax, muni-
cipal rates or even rats. Any man may be
served with notice by the police that his
tenant is keeping a disorderly house, but no
•one keeps a disorderly debenture. It is light,
portable, easily negotiable, and nobody calls
its owner an old hunks for possessing it.
Therefore when Government stock began to
yield about as much per cent, as house-rent,
many people decided that the worker had
better put up his own house instead of asking
the “capitalist,” described as a public enemy,
to do it for him at a low rate in a time of
high interest. And the worker, though he
has union organisation which claimed last
year to stand for 564,000 members with their
families (where there were any), and
possesses large political power and a great
faith in co-operation, has done little to meet
his own case. There has been considerable
talk about confiscating or “taking over” fac-
tories, workshops, land, and even the public
debt (the Perth Labor Conference referred
the question of stealing the public debt to the
Federal Labor members, and they have so
far failed to commit themselves—so mat-
ters are uncertain). But little or nothing
has been said about doing or making things;
in fact, so little has been done or made that
the new Labor daily hasn’t even started
publication. Certainly a great deal has
been said on the subject of house paralysis
or atrophy of the tenement, and a good
many politicians have gone abroad for long
terms at the public expense. But all the
vast intellect of Australia, weakened by re-
liance on loans and on the custom of wait-
ing till the great natural resources develop
of themselves, and by the habit of debating
everything in Parliament and then referring
it to a bureau or commission, seems unable
to build a house. Possibly if it did build
one it would be found that the window
couldn’t be opened without new and com-
plicated legislative machinery, and the
inmates might suffocate, in which case it is
better for them to stick to the open-air life.
Australia used to know how to run up a
shanty at almost any time, and it is a pity
that the art should be lost. If other arts
begin to follow there is no knowing what
may happen.
•
A City Without a Soul.
THERE, is a tragedy about a great
city, like Chicago or Petrograd or, above
all,. Berlin, that has no soul. The city
which has a soul, or is acquiring one, has
done something for humanity. It has been
a centre of art, science, literature or reli-
gion. It has been a nucleus of political free-
dom or at least political improvement. It
has supplied a rallying point for a nation
in times of stress and calamity, and has put
up a scrap for great ideas or even for great
illusions. People have wanted to take
it because they hated it, and have been
ready to die in its defence because
they loved it. If it has a great soul
even folk of other races and other
languages and other faiths feel that the
world would be poorer if it disappeared, and
if the place where it stood was ploughed
up and sown with salt. In short, it is or
has been a lamp for the surrounding peoples.
The lamp may be bright or dim —for in-
stance the lamp of Moscow is not in the
same category with that of Paris. But so
long as it is distinctly brighter than its
surroundings it indicates that a soul is
thereabouts. Edinburgh has a soul, not so
much in the New Town as in the Cowgate
and the Canongate and the High-street and
the Grassmarket. Paris has one above all
places. So have Vienna (rather faded),
Moscow (rather crude), Rome, Venice, Flor-
ence, Cairo, Delhi and possibly Jerusalem.
Carthage, Bagdad, Damascus, Constanti-
nople and Samarcand are lost souls. New
York suggests one in a state of development.
But Berlin, eighth among the world’s cities,
the boss and centre of the greatest military
State and the second greatest manufacturing
and naval State on earth, has no soul and
never had one, and shows no promise of one.
It is the. largest and most gilded and most
self-sufficient municipal clod we know of. It
began, to exist officially 204 years ago, when
five villages or little towns were united like
the handful of villages beside the Eurotas
which made Sparta. It became the Prussian
capital. It commenced its official existence
under the lloiienzollerns, and has always
lived under them. They made it; they
breathed their spirit into it, and it is Them.
The intense militarism which prevails to-day
prevailed from the first, only in the early
days the discipline was worse and the flog-
ging far more horrible. So Berlin appeared
on the page of history as the haunt of the
spiked helmet, and the jack-boot, and of the
hard, sour, bitter, mean kings who were all
named either Frederick or William or
both, and it never changed. It had its real
origin as the camp of a callous military
dynasty—the newest, rawest, most jumped-
up, least-hallowed-by-tradition sort of
dynasty that ever claimed to be in direct
communication with Gott. The dynasty
was always filled with suspicion that some-
body was commenting inwardly on its sud-
den rise, its sham gentility, its pawnbroking
ancestor and its table manners, and was
always asserting that it was a “perfect lidy.”
And its city took after it. Prussia proper is
a flat, sandy, barren, unlovely land, and it
used to be the last stronghold of heathenism
in Europe. Civilisation looked through the
sparse foliage about 700 years ago and found
a tough, impolite, cruel, backward, ill-tem-
pered folk like pagan Pharisees or Coven-
anters wandering about among the tree
trunks. These were the early Junkers.
Berlin never had a revolution, though it had
some sort of riot in 1848. It was never the
seat of a representative Prussian Legisla-
ture. It never beheaded or deposed or exiled
a king, or set up a republic, or changed its
dynasty, or started a Reign of Terror, or
kicked against its aristocracy. It never held
a public meeting except by permission. In
its stiff, well-ordered way it kept the goose-
step all the time. Nobody made it the head-
quarters of a religion after the manner of
Rome, Constantinople, Mecca, Lhassa, Can-
terbury, or Salt Lake City. There was never
a Prussian school of painting like that of
Holland, nor a Prussian architecture like
that of Corinth with Berlin as its centre;
nor did the city ever develop a literary
atmosphere of its own. The German is musi-
cal, but Berlin isn’t. These things might be
excused, for the same may be said of many
other big cities. But the most striking
feature is that, though the country had its
troubles in abundance, the nation never ral-
lied round Berlin as a precious possession
and an embodiment of national sentiment.
It was the centre of a dynasty of drill-
masters and nothing more. It was never
fortified in any elaborate fashion and never
seriously defended. Nobody’s soul was there.
The Prussian metropolis is a vast, tidy,
handsome, geometrical, well-ordered city on
an aggressive sort of plain, beside a river
that never made history. The Forth, the
Rhine, the Shannon, the Tiber, the Danube,
the big Mississippi or Nile, and the little
Eurotas or Jordan are names with romance
in them, but not Berlin’s river. The Yale of
Leven sounds like poetry, but not the Vale
of Spree. It is doubtful if anybody fishes
in the Spree, save under military order. In
Berlin and its environs there are some 30
palaces. It is a a great meeting-place for
that royal family which throws out its chest
and multiplies like rabbits, and is always
newly-varnished and jealous of its new con-
nection with Gott, and is always naturally
named Frederick or William, just as a
small dog can’t help being Fido. At all
these palaces the guard is changed every
few hours by soldiers who step high like
horses going to a cemetery. The police are
the most buttoned-up cops in the world.
Berlin has a reputation for vice far exceed-
ing other German cities, and it is rather
proud of the fact, for vice is a very old in-
stitution, and the royal family of Sodom—
the Kaiser’s cousins by courtesy and doubt-
less also in direct communication with Gott
--especially at the finish—had it badly. Ber-
lin might be frankly proud of its sudden
growth, like Melbourne or Buenos Aires, but
it has to think it is the seat of a dynasty
that helped to skipper the Ark, so it would
gladly buy the pedigree of Damascus if the
thing were for sale. It is a bitter thought
for its people that all the European towns
mentioned in the Scripture are in the hands
of the Allies. Paul wrote a letter to the
people of Salonika, though the document has
been mislaid, but he never even dropped a
postcard to the Prussian capital. During the
later years of the peace Berlin took to stay-
ing up even later than Paris, in order to
show that it was also a gay dog—gayer than
the city that was a dog before CLksar’s time.
But it doesn’t enjoy its beer as Hamburg
and Munich and Vienna do. It always seems'
to be drinking out of a spiked helmet. Per-
haps the best thing to do with Berlin would
be to have it demolished by German pris-
oners and the materials removed at German
expense to Belgium for use in repairing
work. Then the debris could be employed
m damming the river, so that the site would
become mostly a swamp. The world would
be better without Berlin, for it has no soul-
only a ramrod.
The Faded Dream.
Events moved swiftly last week. The Ger-
man dream of Middle Europe proved to be
of the stuff that dreams are always made of,
and the Imperial House of llohenzollern
has woke up. First Bulgaria fell out of the
synopsis. Then Turkey hoisted the white
flag. Now Austria has capitulated. If the
German has a friend left in the world he
could not find him —not if the said friend
could make a get-away. The debacle of the
Austrian Empire seems to be absolute. The
armies have laid down the bayonet, the navy
has been surrendered, the populace is starv-
ing and the old-time governing authorities
are being chased off the premises. TV ith
Germany exposed on all sides, her armies
being severely mauled in Belgium and in the
last corner of Prance that they occupy, the
people clamoring for peace and bolting in
panic-stricken crowds from the Rhine pro-
vinces, the end is surely not far away. There
is nothing left for the German, unless he
thinks it worth while to fight on for harder
terms and an intensification of the miseries
his blood-drunk masters have imposed upon
him during four ghastly years. Anyhow, the
shadow of Bolshevism rests heavily over the
Fatherland these days, and that is even a
more terrible apparition to Autocracy than
the sight of retreating soldiers. It is diffi-
cult to see any reason for suspecting that the
war will not be quickly over.
About the cheap steak and the nationalised
pub
The report of Bananaland’s Auditor-General on the
State enterprises for ’l7-’lB would not be a particu-
larly illuminating -document to anyone who wanted
to get right to the innards of some of these concerns,
but as guides to the proceedings in general the
figures are clear enough. The butchers shops, saw-
mills, coal-mine, stock stations, railway refreshment-
rooms, the pub at Babinda, the fish supply outfit and
the State produce agency represent a capital invest-
ment of £BOO,OOO and an annual liability for rent
of about £25,000. The operations for the year
show losses on timber, coal and fish amounting to
£10,888; profits on meat, stations, the pub, the
produce agency and refreshments of £133,895. The
arithmetic is nothing to be ashamed of, nor in the
circumstances anything to make a song about. The
arrangement under which Ryan gets supplies of meat
for his retail shops is so favorable that failure to
make a profit out of the business would be almost
incredible. The test of the cheap steak establishment
will come when Ryan is not in the position of a
benevolent monopolist, and has to either buy or breed
his own animal. Meanwhile the profit for the year
( £22,925) is a healthy looking reality, and the
public within reach of the State shop has received
some very solid benefits. The State stations show a
profit of £113,239, but there is a comprehensive
silence in the accounts about (1) the basis of valu-
ation, and (2) whether the State has been selling
its meat wholesale at the “cheap shop” rate or
sharing with Ryan's friends, the beef barons, in the
profits from transactions on a different basis. This
latter point is one the opposition seems to be more
interested in than happens to be necessary, for after
a’l it is only of political importance. The crux of
the matter is that the accounts show a profit and
give a reliable clue to the sort of profits P. Enter-
prisje is making in the same direction. As the State
is in the position of being able to run on these
stations 126,467 head of stock (and get an annual
draft of 21,221 head at £ll 6s. Bd.) on a basis
of 12s. 6d. per head per year, this covering all
charges, there seems no reason why the enterprise
should not continue to be a success—if the manage-
ment is reasonably enlightened on the subject of
bad seasons. The pub accounts seem to give oppor-
tunity for Treasurer Theodore to do some hard
thinking. The trading profits are considerable. Of
£12,785 taken at the bar during the year £6454
was profit, a result which suggests that the man
with a thirst at Babinda gets very little for nothing.
But the allowance for depreciation on furniture and
fittings (£106), on buildings (£416) valued at
£19,477 must surely be inadequate. And the placing
of £2387, paid as compensation to the proprietor of
a rival hotel for closing up, as a debit against the
local sugar-mill instead of against the pub deriving
the benefits from the monopoly thus created might
with advantage to all concerned be repented of. The
fittings and furniture of a pub are subject to very
rapid deterioration, and on a value of £4293 depre-
ciation of £lO6 appearing on these accounts is
absurd. As the building is in the cyclone belt, and
was so heavily damaged last year by a gale that
£1604 had to be borrowed for restorations and
extensions, depreciation at the rate of about 21 per
cent, is a good deal less liberal than it ought to be.
Apparently it is a very payable outfit, this pub, and
there are quite a lot of people in Australia who
think there should be more such places and fewer
of the premises P. Enterprise is addicted to main-
taining in many localities.
“Cartridge” : The suggestion that Anzacs
should be sent to garrison the forts of the
Dardanelles, which came from Massey,
Maoriland Premier, shows how completely
the politician is still in the realm of paper
flags and platform talk. When those forts
were in the hands of hefty Abdul nothing
was nearer to the hearts of the Anzacs than
to get inside; but that was a plain war
ambition, not a desire to be spectacular. Why
should Anzac men be sent to these places
which the Turk has evacuated, leaving as
much as convenient of his native dirt behind
him? The natural wish of the Anzac is to
be at home, to breathe the good air of Aus-
tralia or Maoriland, to hear about him the
voices of his friends and to get away from
army discipline, and be his own mail. He
deserves that for the services he has ren-
dred; Jbut Massey would condemn him to rot
out peaceful days, when there is no good
purpose to be served, in miserable holes
where the verminous Turk was lately master,
Euid wheie there is not even an inn nearer
than Constantinople. It might suit Massey
all right to have his fighting Maorilanders
there—in fact, to have them anywhere but
m W ellington or Christchurch may well be
Ins hourly prayer—but the Anzac’s own
opinion ought to be heard on the subject. As
there is no more fighting to be done in the
Dardanelles except with the mouth, why not
send the politicians there to do the garrison
duty? That would provide all the spectacu-
lar effect required. The tongue warriors
could gather on vantage points of the straits,
mount on their soap-boxes and cry to the
passing shipping of the world, “See what
we have done! We have made the place so
safe that even a Massey can walk unarmed
with no immediate fear of his own electors!”
They could even keep Kaisers and sundries
in the dungeons under the forts and raise
revenue by making them dance in chains for
the benefit of tourists; but there is no need
to further torture good citizen soldiers in the
interests of such a circus.
Australia can still rake up a few stalwarts
to fill a gap at the Front. During a recent
march-past of reinforcements in Melbourne
a body of 200 recruits took part not one of
whom stood less than 70in. in his socks.
“Edo”: In Westralia the O.L.P. is gradu-
ally losing ground, and at the present rate
will shortly be an unnoticeable quantity.
The other day its Eight Hour demonstration
at Boulder, once the great stronghold, was a
dismal fiasco, which even O.L.P. Parliamen-
tarians refused to attend. On the goldfields
generally the organisation is not allowed the
use of public buildings for gatherings unless
it guarantees not to fly the red flag or sing
red songs on the premises, and if they do
either in the streets the returned soldiers
knock chips off them. The fact that, as I
write, Corboy looks like beating Hedges for
Swan seat in the Reps, may seem a contra-
diction to the above, but the strength of that
victory is that two of Hedges’s Nationalist
friends are opposing him.
The minimum wage in South Aus-
tralia is to be 10s. 6d. a day for all
ordinary labor. President Jethro Brown of
the Industrial Court decided that the other
day, so that he is rather more generous than
the living-wage-fixers in the Ma State, where
£3 a week has been chalked up as the irre-
ducible minimum. In September, 1916,
president Brown increased the living wage
from Bs. to 9s. a day. He acknowledge?
that that was little enough for any hard-
working man with wife and children. Now
he thinks that Australia is so far out of the
war-wood that he would not be justified in
keeping the workers on the breadline any
longer. So vital does he think it to be to
maintain the industrial efficiency of the com-
munity, that it is absolutely necessary in his
opinion to pay the workers a wage which
will enable them to live in decency and
comfort. The child question looms large
in the eyes of Jethro Brown. Australia
urgently needs a large increase of popula
tion for its defence and the development of
its resources, he says, and if wages are
kept at a very low figure, a premium is put
on celibacy and on a low birth-rate. In
such a state of affairs the worker must look
on the coming of a baby as well-nigh the
greatest of calamities. This is not good
for the individual nor for the Common-
wealth. Which is a mighty true reflection.
The Returned Soldiers’ National party
(Vic.), within 24 hours of the receipt of the
“wireless” announcing the death at sea of
James Manifold, M.H.R. for Corangamite,
published a statement of its intention to put
up a candidate for the seat; while the
National Federation and A.W.N.L. also got
busy at once. The latter pair of political
hand-in-glovers will probably choose a sol-
dier-candidate, too. Corangamite was for-
merly held by Laborite James Scullin, and
Labor should have a chance this time if it
could put forward a well-worn survivor of
the war ; but the only candidates so far men-
tioned are Christopher Bennett and Scullin.
Bennett, who is a Trades Hall official, is
chiefly distinguishd nowadays for his early-
and-often barracking in support of the Labor
recruiting-ballot asininity. Scullin is a very
sick man at present.
Chief Justice Murray has squashed the
resolution of the S.A. Assembly, passed by a
majority vote against strong opposition, that
he should personally make a further inquiry
into the land-purchases of the late Vaughan
Government, with particular reference to the
share of Minister Styles in them. His Honor
is all behind with Supreme Court work
already, he says, and so are his colleagues;
so much so that even the appointment of a
fourth Judge as promised will still find them
all fully occupied. The inconvenience to
those who have the first claim upon his ser-
vices being a sufficient bar, the constitutional
question whether the members of the judi-
ciary ought to be asked to pass judgment on
the political conduct of Ministers of the
Crown need not be discussed, said his Honor,
shortly.

The repertory movement under the J. and
N. Tait management got its best advertise-
ment from its first performance at the Palace
(Sydney). That, is saying a lot, for since
Gregan McMahon brought the scheme to
Sydney enough has been written about it
to raise big expectations; but the perform-
ance was better than the promise. The
quality of Shaw’s “Doctoi’’s Dilemma” and
its value as a drama are mattei’s for literary
debate; but the play is one which demands
particularly good acting, and on Thursday
last it got it. Of the women in the show,
Olive Wilton, as Mrs. Dubedat, did best. Her
opening and closing scenes were remarkably
naturalistic; and through a lot of trying and
unimpressive stuff the author had given her
to say she worked faithfully in true reper-
tory spirit. Georgina Hervey, as Emmy,
gave an attractive and winsome character
study; yet, in spite of its good points, it
was rather out of the frame.
* * * *
“The Dilemma” is a man’s play. Kay
Souper carried the tremendous talking part
of Sir Colenso Ridgeon and made it convinc-
ing ; Raymond Laurence, as Louis Dubedat,
the brilliant artist with no morals, kept to
requirements astonishingly well, even through
the long-drawn-out death scene, and the
supreme absurdity of the artistic credo
mouthed for the benefit of the press; but
Eardley Turner and George Bryant, in the
better character parts, appeared to reach
something like artistic perfection. The for-
mei% as Sir Ralph Bloomfield Bonnington, the
distinguished practitioner with the bedside
manner and the breeziy disregard for all
except the names and shows of science, was
a joy through four of the five acts. Never
did his characterisation falter. He lived the
man he portrayed with just that exquisite
hint of exaggeration which the part de-
manded ; and as he continued to “stimulate
the phagocytes” the full house warmed more
and more to him with laughter and applause.
Ic was Turner’s busy and triumphant day.

to woi'k upon, but
showed himself a
character actor of
the first grade. Cecil
Brooking, in a
smaller part, was
convincing to the
last syllable; while
Alfred Bristowe
and Arthur Green-
away got as much
out of their l-espec-
tive roles as Shaw
himself could ex-
pect. John Fern-
side, “a newspaper
man,” caught the
spirit of the
author’s bitter
satire on the Lon-
don press, as, with
protruding jaw, he
licked his lips over
the “scoop” of the
death scene. He had
little to do, but the
house got raptu-
rous over the way
he did it. Take it
up and down, it
was a brilliant afternoon’s work. The faults
were mostly Shaw’s.

The spectacular px-oceedings on the summit
of the Coi’dilleras incidental to “The Great
Divide” at the Criterion (Sydney) will be
interrupted on Saturday. Miss Starr’s
season has yet a month to run, and as the
menu .is to be frequently changed in the
meantime, “Bought and Paid For’ will be
revived next week.
“Katinka” is going strong at Her Majesty’s

the only tired things in it are the shop-soiled
white birds the Royal Comics keep on sing-
ing about. Those birds look as if they
earned their salaries many times over.

“The Eyes of Youth,” with the capable
Emelie Polini in the lead, is keeping the
box-office staff busy at the Palace (Sydney).
It’s still mostly Barry Lupino and “Honi
Soit” at the Tivoli (Sydney). The revue
isn’t calculated to start any brain waves; so
all the intellectual shirkers who l’efuse to
sit up late sandpapering their minds with
Shakspeare go to it and pay as much for one
seat as would buy all Bill’s “works” in two
vols.

The addition of comedian Joe Brennan to
the- “Piei'rot Pie No. 7” bill will interest a
lot of the people who keep an eye on the
Sydney James shows at the Playhouse (Syd-
ney). “Pie No. 8” (due on November 15)
will contain a burlesque of the current Pal-
ace show. The travesty is labelled “The Lies
of Youth.”

Heni-y story: “One Thousand Dollars.”

“The Answei\” Enid Bennett flutters at
Hoyt’s and the Haymarket in “Naughty,
Naughty,” which is about as forceful as its
name. Sessue Hayakawa is in the same pro-
grammes in “The White Man’s Law,” —a
powerful yarn. Edith Storey is drawing a
six-shooter on the man she loves, merely
because she thinks he is the murderer of her
papa. However, her tender heart softens, so,
instead of punctuating her lover with a
leaden full stop, she merely slits the water-
bag he carries when he sets out on a journey
across the desert. Probably she thought that
would annoy him more than if she killed
him. Florence Reed is having a nasty dream
called “To-day,” at the Crystal Palace, and
the Lyceum shows William Farnum putting
up a stiff fight for his best girl amid the
intensely cold scenery of the Yukon.

The title is the
weakest thing
about it. The mod-
ei’n trick of giving
a name that means
nothing and can be

silly. The wit of

Connie Ediss man-
ages her intoxica-
tion scene without

Beatty make a wel-
come reappearance without having enough
to do. But chief interest centres, perhaps,
in the newcomer, Grace Lavers; she is of the
rather dainty Gilbert-and-Sullivan type that
Australia seems to produce most readily
nowadays, and her childlike style makes an
appeal that is likely to increase on acquaint-
ance. At the Majestic, Paul Stanhope, as
a hardworking stage Irishman, continues to
be taken down by fascinating strangers in a
variety of familiar tricks. The first half
of the programme at this house has reverted
to the old-style first part of Tommy Hudson’s
day, with burnt-coi’k endmen, of whom Jack
Kearns is the most likely. Pictures mostly
make a straight-out appeal to the Girl, who
is, after all, their chief natron. Wonder-
graph asks her to imagine herself a fascinat-
ing actress, libelled by a handsome minister,
and triumphantly convincing him that he is
wrong; or, again, that she is a good wife
carried off by the desperate Bill Hart and
making him see the error of his ways. At
West’s she is invited, as Tess (an American
Tess), to consider the position of herself and
baby if her husband objects to acknowledge
the mamage. All are sti’ong emotional
stories. As a welcome relief there is, at
the Pav., the frank sensationalism of a
“Royal Acrobat,” and the plain foolishness
of Chaplin as a tramp.

Allen Doone’s revival of himself in “Lucky
O’Shea,” at the King’s (Melb.) on Saturday
had all the empressement of a resurrection. A
houseful of his faithful admirers celebrated the
event with the full fervor of their hands and
hoofs, and there were times when they felt
that extra enthusiasm was called for to
proclaim the genius of the actor. As before,
Allen plays the name part with an affluence
of blarney which turns the role into a vocal
recital. His voice is still the same old
ai'tless deception, and his manner remains
the purest confectionery; but behind these
artifices are a stronger physical con-
tent and a budding personality. Doone
owes much of his success to the cap-
able assistance of Edna Keeley. Her
air of regarding him as a complete inno-
vation in gallantry and daring takes a lot
of the sting out of his monotony as a hero.
The cast includes most of the old co., in-
cluding Frank Cullenane, Tom Buckley,
Ethel Grist and Ethel Bashford; but Har-
rington Reynolds and Jack Deeney are com-
parative strangers, and Onslow Wedgeworth
almost looks a novelty with a new mous-
tache. Onslow is the slimy Captain Aubert,
who presumes much and attains little at the
expense of Larry O’Shea, and displays such
a terrible sameness in the pursuit of his am-
bitions that even a fresh lip-ornament lends
variety to the player.

“Hello, Everybody!” at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.), continues to afford pleasure to the
eye, and scene-
painters Board,
Upward and Cole-
man have to be
duly thanked for
their part in the
pi'oduction. Board
deserves honorable
mention for the
dour Scawtch per-
spective in “The
Gathering of the
Clans,” whilst Up-
ward’s masterpiece
is the warm, rich
background for the
huge wheat-stack
which subsequently
turns into a large
human flower.
Coleman’s one
offering is “The
Stone Age,” but it
is a good bit of
imaginative paint-
ing, sustaining the
rugged beauty of
that remote and
wondrous time. On
the dramatic and
musical side the
revue still demands
more cleverness and
character, but its
low comedy has
been visibly round-
ed off. Last week,
also, the show ap-
peared to improve
in another particu-
lar : Minnie Love
“Lucky O’Shea,” at
Melbourne King’s.
Allen Doone ( disguised
as a bailiff) and the
real bailiff.
fell out for three nights with an attack of
laryngitis, and the insertion of Nellie Payne
in the vacancy added some piquancy to im-
personations which were previously lacking
in that essential quality.

Probably due to the exhaustion of their
lung-power, hostilities will cease between
Potash and Ferlmutter in “Business Before
Pleasure,” at the Royal (Melb.) to-morrow.
On Saturday the voluble Adams and Waters
will demonstrate “The High Cost of Loving,”
which is said to have paralysed New York —
or, at least, all of New York which knows
the cost from experience.
*
“Everybody’s Doing It” at the Tivoli
(Melb.), has no natural frivolity, but has a
little gaiety thrust upon it by the scene-
painter and dressmaker. These reliable
performers co-operate valuably in scenes
wherein the literary and musical assistance
seems almost consistently weak and foolish.
The episodes, set for a full stage and spiced
with considerable quantities of Girl, need
more than the support of female loveliness
to give them the necessary sparkle. Artisti-
cally the best of them is the Palais d’Azur
with the Ballet of the Fans, but here the
achievement belongs to the contours and the
clothes of a dozen or more estimable cory-
phees. The long playlet, “The Bright Side
of Life,” in which J. A. Lipman perlmutters
his sentiments with effusive Yiddish persist-
ence, is only next door but one to a dramatic
success. Likewise, the strained and hack-
neyed story, “Watch Your Wife,” fails in
the same measure through the hubby’s exces-
sive vigilance. Every sketch that threatens
to disclose a plot weakens in its efforts to
reach finality, and there are items like “The
Soft Soap Scandal” and “Oh, You Peach,”
which demand more help than the casts can
give them. But none of the principals is
overpowering when presented under the
best circumstances. Chas. Workman
changes his garments and his complexion
several times, but through all these variations
he maintains a sort of podgy childishness.
His repertoire of chuckles and giggles has
reached such dimensions that he ought to
explain them in a dictionary. Frank Greene
sings sad ballads with an expression of secret
and hopeless grief; but the bright services of
his wife, Lottie Sargent, are not requisitioned
as they ought to be. Any audience would
enjoy a lot of Lottie, in preference to the
Yankee invasion headed by Florence Fox and
Fayette Perry, and including Witt and Sang,
just for the pleasure of hearing the English
language now and then. Hugh Huntley is
somewhere described as “Bertie Cecil,” and it
is sufficient criticism to say that he ought
to seize the alias for permanent adoption.
Leslie Gaze warbles like a perfect gentle-
man ; Elsie Parkes and Mabel Holman twirl
satisfactory understandings; and the Tivoli
Ballet is the usual squad of weight and in-
fluence. Also the damsels, May and June,
appear in a “mirror dance” which demands
only a little careful rehearsal to achieve a
very pleasing illusion.
The Wirths are now well established at the
Hippodrome (Melb.), where the exhibitions
of animal sagacity remain an important fea-
ture of the entertainment. Last Tuesday
the brethren repeated their time-honored cus-
tom of rewarding the winning jock, in the
Melbourne Cup. That fortunate horse-navi-
gator left the show the richer for some choice
words and a gold-mounted whip.
Enid Bennett is serving a week at Hoyt’s
(Melb.) in “Naughty, Naughty,” a frivolous
subject in which the pretty Australian seems
especially gifted. This film is the comedy
relief in the current programme, which is
heavily weighted with the genius of Elsie
Ferguson, Gladys Brockwell and Sessue
Hayakawa. Elsie flourishes as “Tlie Rose
of the World,” whereas Gladys is depressed
by a dual personality in “Her One Mistake,”
which soon grows to the dimensions of an
infernal error. Sessue’s Jap features show
through his alleged Arabian disguise as the
repository of all the virtues in “The White
Man’s Law.” The story is located in “the
trackless jungles of Sierra Leone,” probably
not far from Universal City, U.S.A., where
anything from the North Pole to Stewart
Island can be had on application. At the
Melba, Charlie Chaplin is again leading “A
Dog’s Life,” whilst he is repeating his idio-
cies as an impromptu pawnbroker at. the
Britannia next door. The serious subjects
are “The Medicine Man” (Melba), and “The
Magic Eye” (Britannia). The main excuse
for the perpetration of the latter effusion is
the uncommon ability of the child lead, Zoe
Ray.
A complete lack of excitement attended
last week’s City Council elections in Mel-
bourne. Not one of the eight retiring bumbles
was opposed, and the whole boiling was
automatically returned. Of the bunch George
Cuscaden, military P.M.O. for Victoria, is
the most prominent citizen, and he, in re-
turning thanks to the indifferent ratepayers,
expressed the hope that a speedy termination
of the war might allow him more time to
attend to his ward’s interests. Then the
council went on with its onerous task of
choosing a new wall-paper for the ladies’
cloak-room, or some such important civic
matter.
“Gallery Man”: The dull debate on the
new Electoral Bill in the Reps, set all the old
party prejudices flourishing afresh. While
the Tudorites clung to the decayed gag about
the alleged corruption made possible by the
postal vote, the Government followers wept
dismally anent the same disfranchising a
few thousand invalids and the smaller squad
of remote or casual persons who could not
possibly get to the poll. The Nationalists’
vast concern for electoral justice and equity
stops right there, however, and it cannot be
aroused by the more appalling spectacle of
some hundreds of thousands being practically
unrepresented at the Senate elections. But
proportional representation for the Senate
will never be popular with the Nationalists
so long as the old farcical method of election
can be maintained to secure their majority.
Much the same could be said of the Labor-
ites if they ever regain the ascendancy. Elec-
toral reform seems peculiarly the religion of
the minority.
“Point Emery”: Up in Darwin (N.T.)
Administrator Gilruth brought in a liquor
ordinance to put down sly-grog-selling, and
two traffickers were snared by it and did
part of their time in the cool retreat of
Fanny Bay, which looks across towards
China. As soon as possible the alleged sly-
groggers got the lawyers busy, and shell-
holes were blown through the ordinance.
In the meantime Darwin’s Supreme Court
Judge Bevan had gone south for a long
holiday, and until his No. 8 tootsies struck
Territory shores again the illegally-caged
men couldn’t get out. The overland tele-
graph line stands a strong rush at times,
but it couldn’t transmit Bevan’s signature.
We tried to get the warder to leave the door
open, but he wouldn’t come at that, so for
four months, whilst his Honor thoroughly
enjoyed his holiday, we remained in the
clink with nothing but ground and lofty
cursing to while away the time.

Amalgamations have been the fashion in
Australian banking lately. If there are any
banking conceals which should be amalga-
mated they are the Commonwealth and vari-
ous State savings banks. The Commonwealth
has the ideal agency in its post offices, while the
State savings banks, which at one time used
the post offices, now have to do business in
their own branch premises or through private
agents. The Savings Bank of S. Aus. has 28
country and suburban branches and 278
agencies. Last year the expenses of manage-
ment absorbed £43,437, and the average cost
of each transaction (deposit or repayment)
was 7:|d. But though the bank has been able
to keep its exes, down during recent years,
there is every reason to believe that a con-
siderable proportion of this 7,id. could be
saved if all the savings-bank business was
being handled by one authority. But while
it might be the proper thing for the trading-
banks to join forces, there’s little hope of
convincing the State politicians that it would
be good business to amalgamate the State
and Federal savings banks.
The Savings Bank of S. Aus. has been a
wonderfully successful affair. Look at the
growth of deposits :
1909 ..£6,328,870 1914 ..£9,018,837
1910 .. 6,771,150 1915 .. 9,017,061
1911 .. 7,411,710 1916 .. 9,265,705
1912 .. 8,223,260 1917 .. 10,265,849
1913 . . 8,608,478 1918 . . 11,541,427
The recent increase is the more notable
because of the competition of the Common-
wealth Bank since 1913. Independent of the
Penny Bank scheme, there were 280,295
accounts, which, on a population basis, meant
that 03 in every 100 persons in S. Aus.
were depositors in the bank—a remarkable
record. Including the Penny Bank accounts
the proportion was 70 in every 100 persons.
South Aus. has been having a good time for
the past couple of years, and the effect of the
Commonwealth’s method of financing our
share of the war has also influenced condi-
tions —though probably not to the same
extent as in N. S. Wales and Victoria. Un-
divided profit now amounts to £319,568 and
represents the full extent of the bank’s capi-
tal. Deposits, funds, etc., are now invested
as follows
Public securities . . £7,545,259 63.0 p.c.
Mortgages .. .. 1,975,170 16.5
Deposits, cash, etc .. 2,378,897 19.9 ~
Premises . . . . 73,920 .6 ~
Mortgages have been reduced during recent
years, and there is now a quarter of a
million in War Loan. If this bank were a
private concern Ihe holding of more or less
liquid assets would be regarded as extraordin-
arily high. It doesn’t matter much in this
case though, for depositors have the best pro-
tection of all—State guarantee.

Trading conditions for this and other such
cos. have been very good for some years now.
First of all there was the State loan razzle;
and for the past couple of years War Loan
money has been scattered without any
thought being given to the future. This
co. has done particularly well since, .16 years
ago, it took over an old-established business.
For goodwill £72,377 was paid, but divs. were
kept down, with the result that seven years
after its inception the whole of the capital
was represented by tangible assets, and by
1916 the goodwill item had been written
right out of the balance-sheet. The table
above shows that in addition to wiping off
this intangible asset, very substantial re-
serves of £122,666 have been accumulated.
But while the dividend rate had been kept
down to 8 p.c. p.a. until last year, the co.
has also been helped by having held a lot of
cheap pref. capital; of the paid-up capital
of £350,000, no less than £150,000 represents
6 p.c. prefs., which thus call for only £9OOO
per annum. Certainly the co. has gone in
heavily for freeholds (£95,072), but while
these are not directly productive of big re-
turns they possess a fine advertising value,
facing Sydney Central Railway Station.
Marcus Clark’s do a very large time-pay-
ment business, and judging by the growth
of the figures during recent years (£45,000
more is in these advances than when the war
began) the management apparently con-
siders that the immediate future looks safe
enough. Of course, if the worst should hap-
pen the co., under its hire-purchase agree-
ments, can always go out and collect its
sticks, etc., from defaulting customers. On
the other hand, if a large number of its cus-
tomers could not keep up their instalments,
business altogether would be very dead. Most
of these hire-purchase accounts, however, are
short-term agreements, which are also earn-
ing interest for the co., and the present arti-
ficial prosperity does not look like coming to
an end for a while.
This shows how the balance-sheet figures
have moved in 10 years:—
1908. 1914. 1910. 1917. 1918.
Mortgages £38,000 £38,000 £OB,OOO £60,000 £63,500

Cash, etc... 4,439 19,673 16,842 30,278 30,530
Since 1908 £lOO,OOO of new capital has been
got in, and all other liabilities have grown
by £15,611. All assets, in 1908, apart from
£60,000 of goodwill, totalled £399,343. Now
there is no goodwill item among the assets,
which amount to £650,278. So, provided
book debts and stocks are adequately pro-
tected and full allowance has been made for
depreciation, the co. is over £135,000 better
off than it was 10 years ago. In other words,
while ordinaries have received divs. equal to
an average of nearly 8| p.c. p.a., profit
equivalent to another 6f p.c. lias been left
in the business each year. The position
lately has been even better than that, for
the net profit available for distribution
among the ordinaries for the past year was
equivalent to IS p.c. of their capital. The
business has grown very rapidly during the
past few years, and the directors are seeking
the permission of the Federal Treasury to
increase the co.'s capital.

Profits for last year have shown a nice in-
crease. Gross earnings have grown by over
£2200. and as expenses climbed only a little
over £7OO the results have been very good.
This shows some of the figures for recent
years:—

A State Trustee Office was established five
years ago, but its operations have so far
affected this and the one other Sydney co.
very slightly, if it all. The Permanent’s
holding of trust estates has moved from
£3,254,448 in 1913 to £4,726.371 at Septem-
ber 30 last. A trustee co.’s earnings are
mainly derived from interest on its ow r n funds
and its commission cut of the earnings of
trust estates. The higher rate of interest
now obtained from mortgages, deposits, etc.,
is naturally reflected in recent figures; but
expenses have also increased. Five years
ago they absorbed 48.9 p.c, of the earnings;
last year they swallowed 58.6 p.c. This, no
doubt, is mainly due to the heavy work of
handling intricate taxation problems and
also partly to the allowances the co. is
making to its employees on active service.
Capital is £50,000, in 200,000 shares of £5
each paid to ss. Reserves amount to
£46,907; so for the protection of clients there
are now funds amounting to £96,907, while
there is £950,000 of capital callable as a
further protection. This shows how the
funds are distributed :

Until a few years ago the co. had nothing in
premises ; now it owns a very fine building
which is apparently earning its little bit. Of
the other assets, £20,000 is invested with the
N. S. Wales Government in accordance with
the special Act governing the co. The mort-
gages, no doubt, are showing very good re-
turns nowadays. From both the clients’ and
the shareholders’ point of view the position
is equally comforting. Profits for the year
were equal to 15 p.c. of the capital. Though
on their funds the dividend is at the rate of
only slightly over 5 p.c. p.a., if the present
profits can be maintained there should be
something more in it for them later on. And,
on present appearance it does not seem likely
that there will be much of a drop, if any, in
interest rates for a long time. But though
the operations of the Public Trustee have not
had any effect so far, the position may be
different later on. The State office is not out
to make big profits; in fact, it is out to do its
job for clients at practically cost price. And
there may come a time when the competition
from the State office will necessitate a reduc-
tion in the private cos.’ charges. However,
they are doing splendid work, and in view of
their past performances and their staffs of
experts, it is difficult to understand how any
intelligent person can rely on the private
trustee, and chance the risks of blundering
and possibly default.
Tramway Board, Melbourne. — The Mel-
bourne Tramway and Omnibus Co.’s lease of
the city and suburban lines expired on June
80, 1910; and this Board was appointed to
take over the undertaking. The Melbourne
Tramways Trust, which represented the
municipalities and constructed the lines
leased to the co., was then dissolved. In the
Board’s second report—to June 80, 1918 —-
the balance-sheet position is still indefinite,
owing to the delayed settlement of the co.’s
claim for compensation against the Board,
and also the Board’s claim against the co.
for alleged breaches of the covenants of its
leases with the old Trust. Under its agree-
ment the co. paid the interest on debentures
and contributed to sinking funds ; but it pro-
vided its own rolling stock and plant, and
also made improvements. For these assets
the co. claimed compensation amounting to
£442.255, and Justice Cussen, as arbitrator,
awarded £335,000. The Board, however,
appealed to the Full Court on certain law
points and won, and the case was referred
back to the arbitrator. According to the co.
this decision meant a difference of more than
£lOO,OOO, so it appealed to the Privy Council
against the Full Court’s decision. It is
anticipated that this appeal will be heard
this month. The Tramway Board, on the
other hand, claims £565,182 from the co..
alleging that the line was not handed over in
good working order and condition. On this
matter chairman of the co. John Grice re-
cently told shareholders: —
The amount demanded has gradually become larger.
It was £250,000 in November, 1916; it rose to
£367,000 in March, 1917 ; and by May, 1918, it
had risen to £565,000. In preparing this claim the
Board took from March, 1910, to March, 1918, and
oven up to May last further . small alterations were
being made. The company’s defence to this claim
is almost ready to be filed. In regard to the
extraordinary dimensions of this claim under the
leases, it may give you some idea of what it means
when you learn that the details of the claim show
that out of the whole amount over £556,000 is on
account of the condition of the rails and paving
blocks alone. It virtually states that the blocks
and rails have been so neglected that they required
renewing at the time they were taken over to the
extent of considerably more than their original cost.
With these two claims unsettled the
financial position of the undertaking
cannot be stated precisely. Also, “in
view of existing conditions,” says the
Board’s report, “whilst effecting rnanv
improvements, we have avoided capital
expenditure except where a direct and imme-
diate benefit to the travelling public would
result.” The Board was given a borrowing
power of £500,000. but this power has not
been exercised. The gross capital expendi-
ture by the old Trust was £1.660,736, and by
the present Board, from surplus revenue,
£330.984. To these two amounts will have to
be added the compensation which will be
paid to the co. for its assets.
Results for the past two years have
worked out this way : —•
Revenue —
Trams £843,800 £903,020
Interest . . . . . . . . 8,891 23,821
Total .. ..£852,191 £926,84.1

agement . . . . • • £462,132 £514,453

ject to appeal) .. . . 16,750 16,750
Total .. ..£487,171 £536,634
Surplus Revenue.. £365,020 £390,207
Of this surplus of £390,207, £lOO,OOO has
been transferred to a reconstruction reserve
and £30,000 to a renewals reserve. The pro-
fit after allowing for renewals and replace-
ments is thus £260,207. Assuming that the
co. gets something like £335,000 for its assets,
then the capital expenditure will amount to
about £2,326,720, and on that capital the past
year’s net profit is equivalent to over 11 p.c.

This business had been established for many
years when the public was invited to put
some more money into it. For goodwill
£12,000 was paid in shares, and preliminary
exes, absorbed £844, together making up
the deficit with which the co. started—the
£12,844 of capital not represented by
tangible assets. But managing-director
Arthur Cocks has viewed the matter from
the right point of view, and the intangible
asset has now very wisely been written out of
the balance-sheet. To do this absorbed the
general reserves of £10,300 and £l7OO of
contingency reserves no longer required for
the purposes for which they were set aside.
The result is a perfectly-clean balance-
sheet; and after writing oft' goodwill there
are still reserves of £13,465. The profit for
last, year was the best the co. has yet made —
equal to over 21 p.c. of the ordinary capital
after paying the prefs. their dividend. In
1913-14-15 it looked as though the business
was not turning out so profitable as was
anticipated. Since then, however, every-
thing has worked out very well. This com-
parison shows that there have been some
changes in financing the business: —
1912. 1914. 1918.
Deposits. . . . . . £18,458 £22,326 £4,139
Other liabilities. . .. 22,293 19,393 15,867
Stocks 59,507 62,032 68,941
Book debts . . . . 42,889 46,830 43,295
Plant, etc. . . . . 2,132 3,527 2,938
Cash, investments, etc... 1,808 6,169 7,139
Thus the co. used to depend a good deal on
deposits, but they are only a small item now.
Since the close of the co.’s first year liabili-
ties have been reduced by £20,745, but £5900
of new 7 p.c. pref. capital has been got in.
On the other side £9434 has been added to
stocks and £6543 to other assets. That shows
an improvement of about £30,800 in six
years. Put another way: since the inception
of the co. the ords. have received a dividend
averaging almost 9 p.c. p.a. and an amount
not far short of their capital has been left in
the business. Which is a very fine record.

Concerning a mining co-operative scheme:
Bendigo Amalgamated directors have devised a
scheme for establishing a co-operative organisation
among the employees. They start from the conclusion
that the time has arrived to evolve a system “which
not only will make more certain a reasonable return
to shareholders and place their interests on a surer
foundation, but give to the employees an interest in
the prosperity of the enterprise of which they are a
vital part, and enable the co. to add its quota to the
general welfare of the community.” The project pro-
poses (1) profit-sharing, and (2) sharing in certain
benefits, which appear to be independent of profits.
The idea incidental to No: 2 is this: To set up a
council of 15, of which 12 are to be elected—nine by
representatives of each mine or mill and three by the
managers, machine-shop employees and administra-
tive staff (each group one each), and three to be
appointed by the directors. To this council it is
proposed that during the pleasure of the co. £2500
a year shall be voted. Of this sum £5OO may be
devoted to the relief of-cases of miners’ phthisis, but
on the establishment of a system of State i-elief the
grant shall be reduced to £2OOO. Of the income
available to the council 15 p.c. ( £375) may be
utilised in the interest of members of the Associa-
tion employees who become incapacitated. The
remainder, £1625 apparently, is to be used for the
purpose of accident, sick and death benefits, pensions,
annuities, loans, housing, nursing, charity, educa-
tion, sport and entertainment.
The profit-sharing scheme involves vesting 250,000
shares paid to. 7s. *£. in the council on trust for the
benefit of the employees. Dividends arising from
these may be distributed in cash or may be used to
further the objects to which the grant of £2500 a

When Aluminoferric is used in connection with
reservoirs its application is extremely simple. The
cakes or slabs (which measure 22in.x7in.x6in. and
weigh about 561 b. each) are placed on edge in a per-
forated wooden box, or other suitable cage, at the
inflow to the reservoir, and as the slabs dissolve
readily the rate of Aluminoferric applied is in-
creased or diminished in proportion to the rise or
fall of the water passing, and may be readily regu-
lated to a nicety. One pound will clarify up to
3000 gallons of most turbid waters. Particulars from

also numerous cement plants, are using balls of forged
tyre steel, and fin# that they give excellent results.
These balls may be obtained in various sizes from
the Austral Otis Engineering Co. of Melbourne, who
have put in a special plant for forging them, and
can give delivery of most sizes from stock. This

year is devoted. These shares do not carry voting
rights, but if after two years “the proposals have
proved generally satisfactory” the question of the
council appointing two additional members to the
Board is to be “favorably considered.” Now for the
arithmetic of all this. It is mentioned that the
employees, contractors and tributors number 800 and
that the £25OG> is to increase and decrease in pro-
portion to the number of names on the register. The
£2500 means therefore that the co. proposes to fur-
nish a co-operative benefit society with funds equal to
a subscription by each member thereof of Is. 2 kl.
per week, of which sd. per week shall be earmarked
for the relief of sufferers from a disease peculiar to
the industry and from the infirmities of age. The
precise meaning of the scheme to the worker is that
he gets the equivalent of 2d. per day increase in
wages and hands over the 2d. to a committee. The
profit-sharing scheme wears a less definite appearance.
Broadly speaking, it contemplates handing - over to
the employees one-eighth of the profits—when there
are any. What they may be or when they will tran-
spire is, of course, a mere matter of speculation.
Assuming that the profit next year panned out at
Is. a share—there are 2,000,000 shares in the co. —
and, further, that the employees’ roll carried 800
names. In that case the £93,750 capital investment
represented in the share-trust would allow of a dis-
tribution of £12,500 —each worker getting £l5 12s.
6d. This is another way of saying that he. would
receive an increased wage of 6s. a week for that year.
So it boils down to this: —The co. says to the
miners and others: “Work at a certain wage (this is
not stated) and we amplify that by Is. 21d. a week,
which wil' be paid to your co-operative club, and by
an indeterminable amount which will be disclosed by
the year’s profits—if there are any.” There are some
attractive features about the scheme —among them
the opening for a fair sort of gamble. Also there
are some features that are vague. For instance,
there is the reservation attached to the £2500 about
“the pleasure of the company,” and there is a lack of
information concerning the terms of the share trust—
and a lot would depend upon the drawing up of the
trust. The directors in a circular to shareholders
remark that both employees and they who thirst for
profits “have both passed by the solution of the pro-
blem.” This paper will be surprised if the directors
have struck the complete formula. Still the experi-
ment is one that should be watched with interest.

Acting Prime Minister Watt announced
last week that the Federal Government will
finance for three months copper ores, etc.,
produced in the Commonwealth subsequent
to September 30. Any copper ore produced
prior to that date will, theoretically at all
events, have been turned into refined copper
by the end of the year, and so be saleable to
the British Munitions Committee, whose
present contract expires on December 31, No
announcement, however, has been made as to
the basis op which the copper production will
be financed. But it is clear that, under pre-
sent conditions of working, nothing less than
£lOB per ton as a selling price will be much
good to producers. That the Government
will finance the copper producers is interest-
ing, but after all not very helpful. Produ-
cers want a market, and as the Government
has kept the business in its own hands it’s
up to it to find the market.

The annual meeting of C.S.A. Ltd.
(Cobar) was held in Sydney last week and
took the best part of a day to get through.
It does not require a Sherlock Holmes to
detect a want of unanimity. The trouble
was amongst the directors. The more pro-
gressive and, to this paper, apparently
better-informed directors, headed by G. H.
Blakemore, had decided upon the co. doing
its own refining. They had gone ahead and
started buildLisr a refinery at Kandos. The
other section reckoned that Kandos was a
worse proposition than continuing to refine
at Kembla. On the face of it, it was a
pretty hard thing to say, because Kembla’s
terms are fairly stiff. Maybe Kembla can-
not help it. The Bulletin does not say
that Kandos is the cheapest place for C.S.A.
to refine, because it has not inspected all the
places, but it seems very probable that the
Kandos scheme, with reasonably decent ad-
ministration, will considerably’ reduce the
present Kembla terms. Evidently Blake-
more was able to convince the shareholders
that his was the right view, for his sup-
porters were elected to the Board, and G.
H. Blakemore was himself appointed con-
sulting-engineer at the modest fee of 300
guineas per annum. If the old manager of
Great Cobar were more of a diplomat, in-
stead of a plugger, his fee would have to be
considerably bigger.

The discovery of a big deposit of high-
grade mica in Queensland was recently
announced. Mica from an Australian pro-
ducer’s point of view is one of the unsatis-
factory minerals. Perhaps some day when
Australia has developed its industries —
chiefly the electrical industry—it may be
different. Of the two classes of mica, phlogo-
pite (amber mica) and muscovite, Canada
and India practically hold the world’s mar-
ket, although the U.S.A., with its industries
well on their feet, is able to use all the mus-
covite it can produce. Cheap labor enables
India to sell its production abroad, whilst a
Protective tariff sees that the mica resources
of both Canada and the U.S. are turned into
money. Prior to the war mica was selling in
the U.S. at about lOd. per lb. A little while
back the British Government notified the
Dominions that amongst other things mica
was wanted for munition purposes, and as
much as 355. per lb. was offered for the right
class of stuff. Some Australian mica was
sent forward —supposed to be of excellent
quality—but it could not be sold. The ex-
porters at this end allege that there w r as a
ring which prevented them selling the Aus-
tralian product in London.
Several N. S. Wales tin sluicing, cos. con-
tinue to show payable yields. The consistent
Great Britain recently cleaned up five tons
oxide for 161 hours’ sluicing. Shilling divs.
on 10,000 shares have been frequent this
year. Bourke’s Hill reports a yield of Of
tons oxide for six weeks, which is well up to
the average. Pond's Creek recovered 51
tons oxide from 5000yds., but the sluicing
took 357 hours, so the yield of over 4s. per
yard was obtained at a high cost. Avoca tin
is trying out a new system of handling over-
burden, and the show has a fair chance of
making a profit with tin at its present price.

The old gold-mining district around Trun-
key Creek, 35 miles from Bathurst (N.S.W.),
promises to look up again. The new stone
that has been located promises well. While
the Mount Dudley co. is getting into its
stride treating ore from the lower level, new
makes are being located in the same country.
The latest find is by Archie McKellar, who
discovered the Mount Dudley reef five years
ago. He has come across a reef outcropping
w r ith a width of two feet and traceable a dis-
tance of nearly 700 yards over the hill that
it crosses. Pieces of the stone have been
chipped the whole length and are said to
have given consistently good prospects.

So South Langi Logan isn’t to snuff out,
despite the fright given shareholders by
Armytage, Bryant and co. The reason is
the presence of 7000 fathoms of proved wash
worth per fathom. Why that fact
wasn’t put into the half-yearly screed wasn’t
even asked Bryant by perspiring holders
who turned up to hear the requiem. Thire
is a 20 p.c. return on the paid-up capital
from dirt of that grade, so the management
now sobs out “if only the miner would do his
bit.” How the report went out without that
piece of information only Peacock’s office
can disclose, but surely it is time for some-
body to get hold of one of the Langi
mines to work the trick under up-to-date con-
ditions. New Langi has been all of a flutter
because it is not only ready to stope the
Cathcart wash, but operate round the east
end of the intermediate, where 2oz. dirt
shows up. But those who run the mines
won’t see, as put by James Hebbard, that in
times like these labor won’t take any mining
hook unless it is well baited. And Ararat
managers won’t even barley the ground to
catch them. Work must go ahead under wages
equal to those paid on other mining fields or
the mines must shut down. The best part
of £300,000 has been spent on the Langi
mines, and the Boards are talking of still
more calls.

When Jack Priel turned his back on Al,
Gaffney’s Creek (Vic.), after putting the
Dickenson crowd on to gold, he cast about
to get his thumb on to the New Loch Fyne,
another Wood’s Point district veteran. The
inducement was to have a shot at the runs
of quartz in the north and south ends of
the big diorite basin below where Fred
Tricks had stopped work when his crowd
got tired of the hunt. Friel roped in James
Mackay to get a band of willing sports to
stand behind the show while a fresh lift was
sunk and a chase engineered for the gold.
For two years things have looked blue, but
a sudden flip in shares from 2s. 6d. to 10s.
was the warning that the old mine had
developed more than the usual mountaineer’s
tail of gold. Now speckers know that the
narrow vein Friel has been developing to the
north has for 70ft. filled the full width of
his drive with as nice gold showing as at
any time in either of the two levels over-
head. Thus inducement is provided to have
a shot at parallel runs of quartz at either
end of the dyke. Fred Tricks’s great am-
bition was to get out the diorite on a big
scale, as the dyke carries the precious metal
all. through; but he was before his time.
Friel, however, is going to stick to pay
shoots whenever these happen along.

Teddy Miles’s Deebook, Renong (Siam),
was in tough stuff last year, and from
682,617 cub. yds. won 2351 tons tin oxide,
for which it got £33,701, or 11.82 d. per cub.
yd. This return was due to the co. getting
£143 ss. Bd. per ton for its tin oxide. Now
the inter-Allied Commission is on the move to
shove prices down solidly it is fortunate the
plant is making for lib. ground instead of
handling 12oz. material, as during the
past year. Costs were got down from
6.524 d. to 5.96 d. This, though high as
compared with the work done by the Free-
man group, isn’t bad when a plant
is shovelling up clay. The profit of £18,243
compares with £2263 for the previous year,
when the co. had its record run of bad luck.
Deebook owns half the Ronpibon Extended
issue of 30.000 shares on the strength of
having put its No. 1 plant on 90 acres

put up another chapter of accidents in
August and September; winding up with
banging about the bucket-band and smash-
ing buckets galore. This was all because the
Karang, sticky as patent glue, almost tore
the plant to pieces, and so cut into stocks of
spares. The output of the Ronpibon Ex-
tended measured up 164 J tons tin oxide won
from 424,249 cub. yds., so that the average
ground values almost touched 14oz. per cub.
yd, Turned into cash the tin gave £27,273,
or £165 16s. 2d. per ton of oxide, out of
which £3OOO has been made available, as a
div. of £l5OO each for the Ronpibon and the
Deebook. Miles, junior, who runs both cos.’
plants, expects large profits to be squeezed
out of the Ronpibon Extended clays for
many a day to come. The parent Ronpibon
wants cash badly to get a plant or two on
its spare land.

Westralia is considering what inducements
it can offer roving prospectors to look for
gold at depth, instead of getting every-
thing down to water level, and then going
elsewhere. Around or within sight of nearly
every State battery are the water-logged
workings of many a promising claim, and
adjacent to tlie mill itself are the residues
of the crushings which were taken out of
these abandoned shows. If, instead of erect-
ing mills, principally for the benefit of the
local pubs, the Government had made
advances .on developed ore, how different
wmuld have been the result! Instead of hav-
ing a host of unprofitable batteries and a
multitude of idle claims they would have
had all the ore that has been taken out of
the ground intact. In America prospectors
first prove their holdings by establishing ore
reserves, and then have no difficulty in sell-
ing out to company promoters or big private
buyer's.

To date Edna May has proved itself to be
every inch a mine. As for the other shows
on the field, their record is as follows: —Cen-
tral : dividends, 3s. per share, 2s. 6d. of
which has since been recalled. Deeps: 2s. 6d.
paid to shareholders, portion of which was
derived from the sale of reserve shares. Con-
solidated : one distribution of Is. per share
and promises of many more.

Westralia is now looking to the new gold
find at the head of the Kurrawang woodline
to retrieve its battered fortunes. According
to several well-known prospectors who have
been on the spot, the locality is one of the
most promising to be seen anywhere in the
West, and it would not surprise them if
some really good things were unearthed
there. About 50 dryblowers are burrowing
on a small patch, and some are doing well.
Several leases are also being worked, and in
one or two some nice gold-bearing stone has
been exposed.
The annual report of the liquidator of the
Tasmanian Gold Mining Co. contains
nothing very cheerful for shareholders. The
receipts were £33,100, and the payments
£34,175, including 6d. a share (£12,500)
return of capital. During the year
19,190 tons of concentrates and slimes
were dealt with for a recovery of 58610 z. of
gold. The accumulation of richer slimes and
concentrates has been exhausted, but there are
about 106,143 tons of raw slime which is
estimated to contain 15,0000 z. to 20,0000 z. gold.
A special plant is being erected out of odds
and ends to deal with this, but the profit is
problematical. The co.’s freehold land is at
present unsaleable. Plant is being gradually
got rid of, and last year’s sale brought in
£8069. The co.’s pumping plant, the finest
in the southern hemisphere when installed,
has been broken up for scrap. Shareholders
have so far received Is. 6d. per share, and
they hope to get another 9d. before the
blinds are drawn.

Round Hill silver-lead (Tas.) is making
another threepenny call. Two years ago it
was expected that calls were done with, but
the last year’s operations have been very dis-
appointing. The drive has been in hard
country, and not nearly enough ore was won
to pay working expenses. The ore is usually
very low in silver, but in 1915 the tributors
cut a rich patch which carried high values.
Shares boomed to 12s. from about Is., and
then the rich patch cut out, hence the neces-
sity for calls. The show has been working
for 40 years; but shareholders are still
hoping for success. It has been reported
that another promising lode has been cut in
a crosscut off the main drive; it may prove
to be another patch or it may be something
more permanent. But all the silver-lead
shows in the Speck are likely to have a hard
time after the war.

James Chester Manifold, ex-M.11.R., who
died on the voyage from San Francisco to
Sydney last week and was buried at
sea, was born at Camperdown, Vic-
toria. He was a son of John Manifold, one
of a family of pioneers of Port Phillip.
Thomas Manifold, who represented Warr-
nambool in an early Victorian Parliament,
came from Chester and for a time residpd in
the Speck. In 1836 three brothers crossed
to Port Phillip and explored and settled in the
Camperdown district. The recently-dead man
was extremely generous. It has been said of
him that he gave away two fortunes. Not long
since he handed over an estate on the Rich-
mond River (N.S.W.), valued at £30,000,
for the benefit of repatriated soldiers, and
£5OO to St. Dunstan’s Hospital for blind
soldiers, in recognition of the good work
being done. He was only 51 when his time-
sheet was made up. Pneumonia.
The Royal Geographical Society of S.A.
has made John Lewis a life-member in
recognition of his generous support for years
past. It also re-elected him president, in
spite of his protests that he wants to get
away to Europe for a holiday during the
coming year. The Society of Arts of S.A.
has let the veteran painter and teacher
James Ashton (father of Will Ashton) re-
tire from the president’s chair after four
years’ occupation of it, and has appointed
John White, who has been in it before, to
carry the responsibilities. The secretary-
ship and treasurership of this society are
continous, so to speak. At the annual meet-
ing. Powell and Fuller were re-appointed to
these offices. Both men have been in harness
for 21 years.
E. T. Emmett, director of the Speck’s
Tourist Bureau, four years ago waded into
the joyous legacy left by the association
which had been managing the tourist busi-
ness, and quickly trimmed it into shape.
To-day if there is any Australian who hasn’t

been put wise to
the charms of Tas-
mania, Emmett is
prepared to make
him an abject
apology. Last time
that he visited
Bananaland he an-
nounced solemnly
that hot nights and
dust-storms were
illegal in the Apple
Isle. Nobody con-
tradicted him, be-
cause he had the
evidence of a
printed book in his
bag, and he was
prepared to take
his oath on its cor-
rectness, for he had
written it himself.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos John
Whiteman, the blacksmith poet, author of
“Sparks from the Anvil” (B. 24/10/T8). He
was the eldest son of a blacksmith and
farrier, of Dunchurch, Warwickshire (Eng.).
Born in 1823 he arrived in Victoria in
1850. He tried his hand at gold-digging, did
no good and came to Sydney and started
business as a farrier. In 1852 he returned
to Melbourne and tried his luck again on
several goldfields. He also worked at his
profession in Melbourne and Geelong. 1-Ie
had a shoeing-forge at Kirk’s Bazaar,
Bourke-street, Melbourne. Living at Emerald
Hill (now South Melbourne) in 1857 he
helped to found the Emerald Hill Dramatic
Society. In 1862 he was elected a councillor
of the borough and was mayor 1864-5. In
1866 he was elected for the Hill to the Leg.
Assembly; in 1868 George F. Verdon beat
him out by eight votes. Whiteman held the
seat again in 1871, ’73 and ’75. He was
whip to the McCulloch and McPherson Min-
istries. He was a contributor to Punch,
The Australasian, The Leader and
Bell’s Life in Victoria. In 1873 he pub-
lished “Sparks from the Anvil” through
Geo. Robertson.
Captain J. B. Moylan, a recent vic-
tim to pneumonia supervening on fever
in an Egyptian hospital, had the unique
experience of being amongst the first volun-
teers under fire in two wars. At the out-
break of the Boer War he was one of the
N. S. Wales Lancers undergoing training at
Aldershot, and went direct from there. The
Lancers were attached to the Inniskilling
Dragoons, whose C.O. was Major Allenby,
the famous Palestine leader. The General
was the present Field-Marshal French. Cap-
tain Moylan, who was a member of the N. S.
Wales police at Rylstone at the outbreak of
Armageddon, joined up as a private, and was
again amongst the first volunteers under fire
as one of the original Anzacs.
THE MISSING INGREDIENT.
THE KAISER : “Vell, if we can't make a.
good peace, can't you decoct something

THE SCIENTIST : “Yes, sire, if we can find
the proper peace poison."
“’Vai-hoi’s” venerable friend: —
A hardy old gentleman and a walk-about advertise-
ment for the Territory climate at present in Sydney
is W. G. Stretton, who presides over Darwin’s (N.T.)
Police Court. Stretton holds a record, having
been a resident of the North for 49 years with
only three spells out of the country—once east
and twice south—and on one occasion a detail of
30 years went by without a change of air. The
big man (he stands 6ft. 2in. and a bit) joined South
Australia’s police in 1865, and ‘became a great pal
of Adam Lindsay Gordon. W.G.S. went north in
1869 in the old schooner Gulnare, with the first
detachment of S.A.’s police for the N.T. Later he
was chief storekeeper for the Overland Telegraph
Construction until 1872, when we went prospecting.
After that Stretton ran accounts for Darwin’s Post
Office, and in ’B2 joined the Customs and had a
lively time with the Macassar boys who used to
drop down with the trades on to the coast for tre-
pang and additions to their harem. In ’96 he took
charge of Customs and Shipping in Darwin, and
ran that part of the show until the Commonwealth
took over S.A.’s contract and he retired from
S.A.’s service.
Treasurer McPherson, of the Victorian
Government, has taken to wearing brown
bowler hats in imitation of George Turner,
the ideal State Treasurer. McPherson is
terribly canny with public money, especially
where printing is concerned. The Govern-
ment spent nearly £lO,OOO during two years
in a research into the well-known properties
and values of brown coal and its 1500-odd
derivatives. All the data and reports are
ready for publication, but McPherson de-
clines to authorise an outlay of £6O for
printing them. Therefore the £lO,OOO looks
like being wasted, because it would cost a
few bawbees to publish the results of the
investigations. Economy standing on its
head.
Two South Australians, Major W. A.
McCloughry and his brother, Captain E. J.,
have both received the Distinguished Flying
Cross. E.J., the younger, has been awarded
a bar to his decoration for destructive work
over the enemy lines recently. Within a
month he destroyed 10 ’planes and two bal-
loons, and prior to that had five ’planes
and two balloons to his credit. He is now
suffering from a slight gunshot wound —his
fourth. Major W. A. McCloughry was
wounded in the leg at Gallipoli, and on re-
turning to England joined the Flying Corps.
He is now in charge of an aerodrome. At
the time of enlisting they were boys just out
of their teens. Now they are ranked with
the Allies’ most experienced and brilliant
birdmen.
Adelaide Jews are anticipating a difficulty
in securing a successor to Rabbi Boas. The
Jewish college in London has gone out of
business, the war having caused shortage of
funds. It is thought, of course, that Aus-
tralia can’t produce a suitable man. In Ger-
many and other foreign countries rabbis are
plentiful, but the S. Aus. Hebrews don’t
want to draw from such places, as they re-
quire an English-speaking shepherd.
There is not on earth a more fervent ad-
mirer of the. Australian
soldier than Will Dyson.
The artist has spent two
years amongst the men
in all conditions, and the
result .is an unbounded
enthusiasm, whereof the
A.I.F. is the glittering-
object. Dyson writes
tumultuous sentences
frothy with wrath to
overwhelm those who talk
of too much being said
of the Australians to the
inferential disparagement
.of other soldiers. “Too
much is not said ; enough
can never be said. When
the whole truth is told
about this war a thou-
sand times more must be
said in glorification of
. the Australian infantry
than has. yet been hinted
at in the alleged ‘Anzac
brag.’ In the field bur
men have never failed ; in
all circumstances they are
clean and decent, and
their passivity in the face
of adulation that might
have made prigs of heroes
is their most stupendous
quality. It is amazing. \
‘Australian blow!’ The
phrase makes me want to
run out and bite some-
one. There is no such
. x ~ thing, apart from the
Australian blow that has swept Germans like
thistle-seed from a score of battlefields.”
Edwin Corboys, the 22-year-old Anzac who
won the Swan seat last week, is the young-
est M.H.R. yet elected. During the election
preliminaries the Nationalist press main-
tained a singular reserve as to the new mem-
ber's experiences with the A.1.F., though his
military career was a most worthy one. Cor-
boys is a Cornstalk, whose parents took him
? ver to Westralia as a child. Rejected dur-
ing the early months of the war, he tried
again and again until passed for service in
June, 1915. After Gallipoli he saw plenty
ot action in France and was twice wounded,
first at Pozieres and again at Flers.

various other things, who stands sft. or
thereabouts in his shoes, and who has been
Man Friday to Gilruth, Administrator
ot the N. Territory, for some years, has
gone over to Yestey’s meatworks as sub-
manager. His chair in the Public Service
has been taken by the genial giant, R. J. Evans,
who was Government accountant in the North
and, for a time, superintendent of the local
rail track south to the Katherine. The just-
departed Carey makes up for lack of stature
in his rubber-ball energy, girl-like com-
plexion (which has earned him the name of
Rosey), and a sense of importance plus a
temper that, when it ascends, reaches some
heights. R.J.E. some- time ago used to add
up figures in the railway accountant’s office,
Perth.
“X.Y.”; When Judge Fitzhardinge was
explaining at Wollongong 18. 17/10/’18)
that his experience of juries was that they
returned just verdicts, he overlooked one.
Twenty-six years ago 1 heard him try a
case of cattle-stealing, on the North Coast,
in which 20 head of fat cattle were alleged
to have been stolen by a butcher carrying on
business in another district. The hide of
only one was secured by the police, and that
did not bear the herd brand, although the
beast from which it came belonged to the
owner of the other 19. This hide was the
principal exhibit at the trial. After hear-
ing a mass of absolutely conclusive evi-
dence, to which there was practically no
defence save a denial of facts, the jurv
said ‘Not guilty!” The Judge made no re-
mark to. the jury, but he said, in a loud,
clear voice, which could be heard plainly by
all in court: “I order the hide, now in
court as an exhibit in this cause, to be
handed over to Mr. ” (the owner of the
missing cattle).
A STRATEGIC MOVE.
“The N. S. Wales Congregational Union moved
and carried: ‘That this assembly requests that the
Federal and State Governments shall forbid the sale
of all intoxicating drink for 48 hours after the news
is given out of the proclamation of peace.’”
“What the ?”
“S'origlit, ole man. War'll he over in a day
or two."
Mary Hannay Foott, who died at Bunda-
berg (Q.), last week, a large-hearted and
genial personality, will be long remembered
in Australia by a few songs, particularly
“Where the Pelican Builds.” Mrs. Foott
was born in Glasgow in 1846, and came to
Australia at the age of seven. After study-
ing art in Melbourne she married Thomas
Wade Foott, of Dundoo station, on the War-
rego (Q.) —the “new country” of one of her
poems. Her husband, dying in 1884, she
turned to journalism, and for 10 years was
literary editress of The Queenslander.
Two books of her verses, long since out of
print, deserve republication. Her eldest son.
Brig.-General Cecil 11. Foott, is now at the
Front; another son, Lieut. A. P. Foott, was
killed in France last year.
“Bert R.”: Colonel Ryan is the terror
of all surgical cases recommended for return
to Australia. His word is final, and many
of the troops who pass their preliminary
examinations successfully come a big G when
they meet Ryan. Occasionally he relaxes
his manner when dealing with a badly-
wounded Billjim. One instance: Seated at
a table in an inner room he had turned
down about a dozen applicants in succession,
and the sounds of murmuring were loud from
the waiting-room outside. The next man
in had only one leg. Ryan inquired his
name and number, then added kindly, “All
right, my boy, we’ll send you home.” As
the_ door closed he turned to the M.O. who
assisted him and remarked pleasantlv,
“There you are, and still they don’t think
I'm a good felloic!”
THE VICTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Something arranged it.
How was it done?
Falsehood estranged it—
The truth that has won.
Falsehood was stronger
To break and to rend;
But truth lasted longer
And won in the end.
Something had planned it.
Brute that was man,
With brain to command it
To victory ran.
No power to slay it
Was left to the free
Who battled to stay it
’Twixt death and the sea.
Someone prepared it,
The sword of their doom.
Someone unbared it
O’er shame and the tomb.
Bells in the steeple
Clash rapture abroad!
W T ho looked on his people ?
Proud heart, was it God ?

it into the fabrics for which this country
is justly famous.
Our orders for medium and light-weight
Tweeds and Suiting have been de-
livered to us by the several Australian
Mills with which our requisitions were
placed some considerable time ago.
An Austral Made-to-measure Suit
should be your choice, for the Style
and shape-retaining features which are
tailored into all Austral Made-to-
measure Suits have been one of the
main reasons for their increasing
popularity. Another reason has been
the attractive range of dependable
suiting - submitted for our Customers’
selection. A last, but by no means least,
reason is the moderate price charged
for every suit, no matter what grade of
material is selected.
Just opened, a full range of Famous

Mr.W.J. DEANE DECLARES CLEMENTS TONIC ALONE KEEPS HIM HEALTHY
Mr. W. J. DEANE is the senior member of the well-known firm of
\V. J. DEANE and SON. 177 Pitt Street, Sydney, recently removed from
500 George Street, and has a very high opinion of Clements Tonic.
The firm of Deane and Son are well known as publishers of popular
songs, music, theatrical sketches, operatic melodies, and as vendors of
musical instruments. They claim to be a firm who advocate the sale of
Australians Songs and assist Australian talent. Two of their ; chief song-
hits have been “Boys of the Dardanelles” (Marsh Little), and “There,
There, There,’ by Private Harry Cohen, who was wounded at Gallipoli,
the authors being both Australians.
Mr. Deane declares this is the first testimony he has given to any
medicine, but the great good he has derived from Clements Tonic leads
him to give public credit to it.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
For a period of ten years oif and on I have taken your Clements Tonic, and I regard it as one of the best of nerve
and appetite-creating medicines.
I feel I am right in saying I owe my present good state of health to its judicious use, so that others nervy in
temperament and in poor health generally may benefit as I have done. It is a magnificent remedy for all professionals
to use.
You may use this letter as you will for the general good. For want of sleep and loss of appetite I know of no
better medicine.
(Signed)
If you cannot sleep at night—if you are so tired when your day’s' work is done, and
can scarcely get home, take Clements Tonic. You will soon be bright and take a better
and keener interest in life. Clements Tonic and good health go hand-in-hand along the
ways of life. All Chemists and Stores Sell It.

Goethe was honest about it anyway. Said
he:—
We Germans are of yesterday. No doubt in the
last, hundred years we have been cultivating our-
selves quite diligently, but it may take a few
centuries vet before our countrymen have absorbed
sufficient intellect and higher culture for it to be
said of them that it is a long time since they were
barbarians.
Goethe passed out in 1832, so the process of
civilising the barbarians hasn’t had much of
a show yet.
AN INSTINCTIVE FOREBODING.
THE PESSIMIST: “I knew somethin' 'ud
'appen to-day — it's the anniversary of
me weddin.”
This year's Melbourne Cup, manufactured
by Drummond’s, has an historical precedent in
the shape of a gold cup presented by Francis
Bacon to his house at Stewkey, England, in
1547. Bacon’s graceful vessel, which was
sold in the Cold Country for £2500 a few
years ago. is an almost hemispherical bowl
with a small gold boar posed on the nob of
the flattened lid. Drummond’s 18-carat re-
ceptacle is a replica in everything but the
beast on top, which in this case is a neddy
of gentle disposition. Under the circum-
stances no better animal could be suggested
for the leading place, though there are many
saddened punters who feel that it should
have been a cow.

“G.E.F.” : Last year, when things were look-
ing bad for the strictly-rationed Briton, our
ship arrived at a South Australian port to
load a general cargo of victuals, the biggest
percentage to be wheat for England. The
first lot of cargo to arrive was three trucks
containing immense blocks of marble for Aus-
tralia House! Special derricks had to be
rigged to get them into the hold, and as he
watched the chief engineer said bitterly:
“Asking for bread and receiving a stone.”
* * * *
“0.L.” : A point not loudly mentioned in
the raised-rents discussion now proceeding-
in Melbourne is that of the increased muni-
cipal liabilities of house-owners. Some muni-
cipalities. such as the city of Melbourne,
have gone the whole hog and raised their
rate, while others have left, the rate alone
and gone in for considerable revision of their
valuations. Then up goes the rent. The
increases in rent since the war started seem
to have ranged between five per cent, and 20
per cent., and have been proportionately
greater in the “industrial” suburbs. The
fact is that the toiler isn’t really happy un-
less living just next door to his job. no
matter how skimped he may be there for
room. Sooner than go out three or four
miles, where the fresh air is, he will live
with four other families in four rooms and
a pantry; and he grouches bitterly if the
demand for houses means a couple of bob
extra, which he saves in train-fare. Yet,
though rents are up at Collingwood and
Footscray, with half a dozen families bat-
tling for any newly-vacant house, a dwelling
in the southern, more “select” suburbs still
brings nearly twice as much rent as one of
the same class and cost in the factory dis-
tricts. Small wonder that in these latter
areas house-building is almost at a standstill,
except in the case of the worker who is'
building for himself.

“C2H6O”: This is to support “Algy R.”
(B. 24/10/T8) re the British West Indians.
I met good old 8.W.1. first at Meerut, India.
where he came into
our hospital urgently
in need of a surgeon.
He was as good a
specimen of a man as
I have ever met, stand-
ing (when he could
stand, for he was
mostly on his back i
about Oft. 2in. and
every inch a gentle-
man. By his refine-
ment and excellent
manners he made him-
self a favorite with all
the sisters and staff.
Employed most of his
time by composing
music, said to be
hymns. We travelled
together from Bombay
to Suez, and when we
parted we exchanged
addresses and promised
to write each other
when we arrived home.
A letter from him
from Brown’s Town,
Jamaica, came to hand
last week. This is
his simple tribute to
the Aussie: “I shall
never forget you Aus-
tralian boys. Wher-
ever I go I shall
always speak well of
you all. Oh, my Aus-
tralian boys; they are
nice and gentle, kind
and mannerly. and
neither shall I forget
that time I spent on
board the old
among you all.” Any
Australian who has
campaigned with
8.W.1. will value this expression of friend-
ship from a staunch fighter.
The British fleet has gone through the
Dardanelles to occupy the city of the Un-
speakable Turk, which, by amazing luck, no
enemy has occupied since the Unspeakable
got it 465 years ago. The tragedy lies in the
fact that the Anglo-French fleet might have
done exactly the same thing in the Spring of
1915 if the Allies had had some capable spies
serving in the Turkish batteries and holler-
ing for the Sultan by way of camouflage.
When they drew off after a day of supreme
disaster the Hun officers in charge of the
batteries packed their bags for a sprint to
Constantinople, and the maundering old Sul-
tan packed his bag and took a single ticket
for Asia. The guns had fired practically
their last shot and had no hope of getting
sufficient supplies in time. As it happened,
A MERE DETAIL.
MA: “No, she will not become engaged until she is 20.”
PA: “But. my dear woman, she may not get the chines when she is 20.”
Ma : “Well, then, she will remain 20 until she does.”
the Allies didn’t know, and it was impossible
for them to guess that even the happy-go-
lucky Turk had risked such a place with
only one day’s supply of munitions. When
the ancient monarch heard of his reprieve he
flapped his paws feebly and said that Allah
was a great institution. In 1807 a British
fleet actually forced the Dardanelles and
anchored before Constantinople, but then the
British admiral stopped to negotiate for a
surrender instead of dropping heavy shot on
the palace, and munitions were hurried up,
and there was another reprieve. A battered
fleet got out of the hole with difficulty, after
being badly mauled by the guns at Abydos,
where the bride that Byron wrote about
hung out.
“F.H.”: It may be a bit early to make
the suggestion, but there is one sort of sol-
dier I should like to see, properly mounted,
in the celebrative march-past which happens
in my city when the kybosh has finally been
put on the Hun. Whatever is omitted,
surely the camelero should be there, even if
only half a dozen of him. Camels come dear
in Melbourne and Sydney, no doubt, but
probably there are enough cainel-owners in
various parts of Australia to provide a small
team on loan for such an occasion.

Lots of people have a notion that real
estate is a safe investment, because it can’t
run away; but one Fletcher, a property-
owner of Brunswick (Vic.), knows better.
In 1900 he bought the place he occupies,
alongside a quarry-hole, and in ’O5 a brick
co. bought the quarry, drained it and started
work. Ever since then Fletcher’s back yard
has been sliding piecemeal into the quarry-
hole, while his back fence hangs like
Mahomet’s coffin. Recently Fletcher sought
an injunction against the brick co. to pre-
vent it removing any more of his desir-
able building allotment, and an order com-
pelling it to restore what it had
annexed. The co. said it hadn’t interfered
with the land near Fletcher’s; the soil was
merely sliding away by reason of soakage.
or the sewerage system or the extra weight
of Fletcher tramping about his back yard.
Ultimately the Law, having hunted up an
ancient decision of the House of Lords, de-
cided that the person who originally opened
up the quarry was responsible and Fletcher
must proceed against him. Which was no
doubt an unchallengeable decision, but very
unsatisfactory to Fletcher. The original
digger of that quarry is long dead.
“Wig” : Business is so good with the South
Aus. Supreme Court that the Government
has decided to appoint a fourth judge. The
favorites in legal circles for the position are
A. W. Piper, E. E. Cleland, H. Angus Par-
sons, M.P., and P. McM. Glynn (all K.O.’s).
Dr. Tom Browne, partner of Josiah Symon.
is also mentioned. However, these are all
busy barristers, and perhaps the salary of
£l7OO per annum (the same as the other
puisne judges) will not tempt them away
from a profitable practice.
THE SURPRISE.

surprise for mg birthday.”
“Oh, haven't gov decided get, dear?”
“Broad'’ (from France) : “Dial Sight” (B.
13/6/'18) asks after “Rags,” the Yorkshire

ont of a motor-car near Melbourne Town
Hall by a driver in the Battery. “Rags”
is now yapping near where I am writing. *

I WROTE A LETTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wrote a letter to my dear,
And at the end 1 placed a kiss,
Small joy have I in aught but this.
For bitter words that sting and sear,
I wrote that day from black-proud heart —
God giant the kiss cased the sore smart.
The letter I wrote to my dear,
Came back to me last week from Franco,
Not proud to-day, but shamed my glance.
Full on my kiss a blood-stained smear,
Tells of another true and deep
Sent by my love ere his last sleep,
T wrote a letter to my dear,
And at the end J placed a kiss—•
Now God be thanked always for this !

The conclave of the B.C. bishops of Aus-
tralasia to be held in Sydney at the close of
the war will not be the first of its kind fin
the Commonwealth. At Easter, 1869, the
bishops, then numbering eight, with one
Archbishop (Dr. Polding) held a provincial
synod in Melbourne. The prelates attending
were Polding (Sydney), Murray (Maitland),
Quinn (Bathurst), Lanigan (Goulburn),
O’Quinn (Brisbane, brother of the Bathurst
man, who declined to use the O), Goold
(Melbourne), Shiel (Adelaide and Hobart
Town). They were entertained at a public
TEE DESTINATION.

going is to Berlin.”
banquet in the Orderly-room, Eastern Hill,
and John O’Shanassy presided. They were
also entertained by the Governor, Viscount
Canterbury, at Government House, Toorak.
This time the party, if full registered, will be
35 and may include seven archbishops. Dr.
Redwood, of Wellington (M.L.), is the
senior, having been consecrated in 1874.

“Hamer”: The statuary on Australia
House, London, is by Parker, the Banana-
land sculptor, about whose work one
does not like to say harsh things; yet it is
impossible to look at that group of figures
without doing so. Parker won a £lOOO
prize at a time when he badly needed it;
and being first in the competition estab-
lished his name and reflected some glory on
Australia, for he and Bertram Mackennal
were the only prize-winners. But that did not
entitle him to do the sort of thing he has
done to the front entrance of Andy Fisher’s
unpaid-for palace.

“Bert R.”: Cases of soldiers’ wives with
an unexplainable infant on hand are plentiful
enough. In London last year I noticed a
cable going through lI.Q. which read:
“Please inform Private that his wife
has given birth,” .etc. Thought it curious, as
by his regimental number and unit he had
been away over two years, so looked up his
record and found this to be the case. Pointed
it out to the operatoi’, who only grinned. “I
see plenty like that,” he remarked. Don’t
know yet whether the Defence Department
supplies this information, or whether some
well-meaning friend does it out of kindness.
“Dinkus”: When I saw them first they
were a small band of seven diggers, led in-
formally by a lance-corporal who carried a
machine-gun minus its tripod. Two of his
followers carried a box of ammunition each,
while another wore two belts round his neck.
After borrowing a “garsper” and a match,
the corporal explained that they had scrapped
their way out, after having been suri'ounded.
They earnestly desired a rifle and bayonet
each, some bombs if available, a place to
investigate the working of the machine-gun.
and the location of the nearest Boche. I
fitted them out, sent them over the ridge, and
told them to squirt the gun down the valley,
as the only living things down there were a
few Bodies. After-
wards, during a lull, I
heard the gun chatter-
ing spasmodically. We
were ordered away
next morning and I
didn’t see them again
for some days. When
I next met them we
were some miles away
from where I left
them, and they were
reduced to five (the
corporal had gone
west). However, they
still wanted rifles and
bayonets and informa-
tion as to the location
of the nearest Boche. t
Equipped once more,'
they pushed off down
the hill with their
gun, the digger with
the aminunition-belt-
muffler in charge.
About a week after
that I saw them again.
They once more num-
bered seven, having
been reinforced by one
L.H. trooper and a
Maoriland cyclist.
This time I saw them
go into action. They
filed along the top of
the railway embank-
ment, disdaining its
cover on account of
the mud, and about
500 yards in front of
us they got to work.
One lay down on the
track and held the
gun while another
squatted and worked
it. The other two were behind the embank-
ment filling and passing up ammunition-belts.
They must have annoyed the Boche consider-
ably, for he started lobbing over shells of all
sizes searching for them. I could see them
through the smoke and dust, and they were
still there when night fell. I don’t know
what their game was, but they seemed
annoyed about something.

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: A bit of Mel-
bourne was announced to come under the
hammer on November 6 in the estate of the
late George W. Petty, an early Melbourne
butcher and later owner of Maribyrnong
stud-farm. They are the Railway Hotel and
two adjoining shops on the south-west cor-
ner of Flinders-lane and Elizabeth-street. At
the first land sale (conducted by Robert
Hoddle), Lachlan Macalister, of Goulburn
(N.S.W.), gave £35 for that corner half-
acre. In 1888 it was valued at £247,000.
Macalister bought two adjoining half-acres
in. Flinders-lane at £35 each. These were
each valued in 'BB at £118,500. A timber-
yard, by one Healey, had occupied the cor-
ner for some years, when the Shamrock
Inn, kept by Bartle Wheeler, came into
existence. When the Melbourne and Hob-
son’s Bay Railway was constructed, with
the terminal station quite handy, the house
became the Railway Hotel. It’s still there
to-day. so I’ll turn in and have a pint.
* * * *
“A.”: An unusual law-case will give a lot
of horsehair in Adelaide a flutter shortly.
With the increased excise duties the hotel-
keepers decided to advance their prices for
drinks and cease giving counter-lunches. (In
many pubs the lunch was a sumptuous free
meal, Avhich included turkey, Irish stew and
other delicacies.) The proprietor of one
house considered that it was not in the in-
terests of his business to cut out concessions,
so he filled up the feed troughs as custom-
ary. Then he suddenly found a difficulty in
getting beer supplies, and instructed Gent.
One to issue a writ against 12 persons
upon whom he had cast the eye of sus-
picion—these were members of the Licensed
Victuallers’ Association and the South Aus.
Brewers’ Association —claiming damages for
alleged action in “conspiring and agreeing”
not to supply him with hop-juice. If he wins
there will be a hurried commotion, particu-
larly amongst merchants who refuse to sup-
ply storekeepers with general lines unless they
maintain the selling rates of their (the whole-
salers) proprietary brands.
Victorian Minister P>owser (it is hard to
take a man called Bowser seriously) was
deputationised reoently re dubious postcards,
picture films, etc. A Board of censors, “on
which fathers and mothers would be repre-
sented,” was asked for. Bowser said he
liked the idea of a Board on which fathers
and mothers would be represented. But if
aunts, uncles, brothers-in-law and childless
parents also demand representation it will be
something special in the way of Boards. And
even then it would leave out people who are
unmarried through blighted hopes.

Just now nearly everyone is feeling the
pinch of depression on the Westralian gold-
fields, and few worse than tfie Church. Some
denominations have gone out of business
altogether, others are thinking of following
suit, while the Anglican tribe, which has a
bishop at Kalgoorlie. has pathetically
appealed to the Perth diocese for some of
its territory in order to counterbalance the
loss in revenue that has been sustained by
the defunct condition of many one-time
flourishing centres in the back country.
Owing to the rapid decline in population the
Anglican diocese of Kal-
goorlie, as present con-
stituted, has little chance
of permanency. In fact,
but for being needed to
enable Perth to have an
archbishop, it would pro-
bably never have been
created at all.
“Chev” : Let me tell P.M.G. Webster, who
recently threw cold water on the idea of an
aerial mail service, something about the uses
the aeroplane is being put to. On the big
San Cristobal ranch in New Mexico the
thousands of cattle were not so many years
ago looked after by 150 cowboys. Then the
ranch-owners installed automobiles, and the
work was done, and thoroughly, by seven
men. Now the management is installing
aviators! It is estimated that their vastly-
superior speedy will round-up the most scat-
tered herds with great saving of time and
money, and though I admit that proof of
successful working has yet to come to hand, I
see no reason why the aviator cow-puncher
should not make good. An enterprising
mining co. in Mexico whose ore is mined at
an altitude of some 10,000 ft. are superseding
the pack-mules, which carry the ore in small
quantities to the valley below, with aero-
planes, which can volplane down in a few
minutes, and easily reach the high altitudes
Then, again, an aviator is engaged by a
power co. in Sacramento, California, to carry
an expert once a week to inspect two divi-
sions of wire lines 08 miles in length over the
valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers into the Contra Costa range of moun-
tains, where their elevation is in places
2000 ft. Previously a big number of men had
to be employed to inspect the lines, searching
for fallen wires, broken insulators, etc., but
it is claimed that the work is done much
better by the aerial linesman. Who is going
to be the first station-owner in Australia to
introduce the aerial boundary-riderV
“I-liphen”: In our absence (at the war)
please preserve the Chow laundryman. Only
since I came to Italy to fight do I appreciate
his sterling worth. The Italian doe.s not
shine at the tub. When my embattled wash-
ing i s returned to me the greatest care has to
be exercised to keep the linen just arrived
separated from the linen going out. Get ’em
mixed and it’s impossible to tell the differ-
ence. Weekly I have bitter altercations
with the decayed contessa (everyone is a
conte or contessa in Italy) who condescends
to tub for me. In place of my pure, all-wool.
Australian under-garments I receive low-
born cotton rags. With my 10-words Italian
vocabulary and a wealth of gesture I fiercely
and uselessly debate with a lady who per-
forms like a grand-opera star. When a mem-
ber of a foreign nobility washes for you your
shirt is lost as well as your temper.

About the graves at Pozieres height;

And friendly hands have scattered flowers.

The ghostly voices tell each other,

This is the Overland Car, shod with Goodyear No-Hook Straight Wall Cord Tyres, in which
Mr. Fred Z. Eager established the phenomenal time of 19hr. 38 between Sydney and
Brisbane. Mr. Eager, a well-known personality in Australian motordom, is at the wheel.
Goodyear Tyre Equipped Overland
Smashes Sydney to Brisbane Record
by 6 hours and 24 minutes.
Mr. Eager, interviewed just after his arrival at Brisbane, said “the Goodyear
Cord Tyres came through absolutely free from trouble, and were
in a great measure accountable for the splendid time recorded.”
GOODYEAR TYRES in this long-sustained
grind over all sorts of road proved absolutely
to be far and away ahead of all others for speed
and endurance. No other tyres could possibly
come through this test as Goodyears did.
Leaving the G.P.0., Sydney, on Saturday at
10 p.m., Mr. Fred. Z. Eager drove the whole
distance, with only two short intervals for
refreshment, making the phenomenal average of
over 31 miles per hour through the whole
hours. The tyres were not touched at any part
of the journey.
Only four Australian Motor Car Records have
been attempted on Goodyear, and all four have
been secured by cars equipped with # Goodyear
No-Hook Straight Wall Cord Tyres, world-famed
for spring, stamina, vitality and endurance.
These are the Southport Speed Trials, when 84
miles per hour was attained; the Hill Climb Test
at One Tree Hill; the Brisbane-Toowoomba
Record of 85 miles, and last, this 620 mile run
from Sydney to Brisbane, beating the best
previous record by 6 hours 24 minutes.
Over 90 per cent, of the Speedway and Motor Records made in the U.S.A. during the last two seasons were made on
Goodyear Cords, so how, in the face of these truly marvellous performances, can you consider any other equipment than Goodyear.
Goodyear Tyres , Heavy Tourist Tubes and Tyre Saver Accessories are easy to get from Goodyear Service Station Dealers.

A HANDY REMEDY FOR
INDIGESTION AND DYSPEPSIA.
For a long time it has been recognised that
bisurated magnesia forms the best of all
remedies for indigestioß, dyspepsia, heart-
burn, flatulence, and other forms of digestive
and stomach trouble, many remarkable cases
having been reported by those who have made
a practice of taking half a teaspoonful of this
simple antacid in a little water after meals.
Only one difficulty stood in the way of the
universal adoption of this method of treat-
ment, and that was, in the original powder
form bisurated magnesia was not adapted for
use by those who were compelled to take
meals away from home. But even this slight
difficulty has at last been overcome, and the
genuine bisurated magnesia is now available
in the form of small, compressed tablets, put
up in handy pocket flasks, and obtainable of
high-class chemists everywhere.— Advt.

THE LATEST MESSAGE.
CHIEF HUN: “Yah! Undt dis Wilson vos
der man who used to write me nice,
bolile notes vunce a week or so! Hein?"
George Black, referring in the N. S. Wales
Leg. Council the other night to P.M.G. Web-
ster’s poem about the virtues of guzzling
hot water, suggested that the Federal Gov-
ernment laureate should be appointed Min-
ister of the Interior!
The liquor trade brightened up consider-
ably when the Speck’s Assembly hurled out
Licensing Bill No. 1. It was introduced by
Premier Lee to make the six-o’clock-closing
law effective. When the first six-o’clock-
closing measure was before Parliament Lee
secured the passage of a clause giving licen-
sees the right to open “temperance bars” on
their premises between 6 p.rn. and 10 p.m.
He recently told a Cold Tea deputation that
Bung had shamelessly abused this privilege,
and promised that he would close the pubs
absolutely at six. “No self-respecting Gov-
ernment could do less,” he said. The Assem-
bly expressed its opinion of the self-respect-
ing Government by emptying the Bill out by
18 to 11. Licensing Bill No. 2, which pro-
vides for a referendum on State Prohibition,
and Bill No. 3, which proposes to abolish
“shouting,” are Dromised the same fate.
One of the places most remote from the war
is Maoriland, and maybe on account of that
the House of Reps, last week rejected by 48
to 12 a motion in favor of having an early
general election. As the vote in favor of
extending the life of Parliament until Dec.,
1919, was • carried by a big majority, it
seems as if the idea of hanging on in per-
petuity has grown more popular. Mean-
while the circumstance that elections are to
be held next month in U.S., that the
British Government is getting ready to rush
to the polls, that elections have been held in
S. Africa and Australia is apparently not
regarded as of any consequence by Brother
Massey. Of four by-elections held in
M.L. in recent months three have gone
dead against Massey, and at the other his
man scrambled in on a minority vote. Hold-
on Bill was a long time waiting to get in.
It seems as if the populace will have to wait
a long time for a chance to fire him out.
Curious arguments and cross-voting
marked the resolution ultimately taken by
S.A. Assembly to give ex-Minister Styles a
further hearing regarding, the land purchases
of the late Vaughan Ministry. Smeaton,
remarking that the firiding of the Royal
Commission (which was Magistrate Noel
Webb) had “left this man in the air,” moved
for a Select Committee to take further evi-
dence, and either condemn Styles altogether
or acquit him of blame. Gunn, Opposition
leader, suggested as an amendment that the
Chief Justice should make the inquiry, and
on a mixed division this was carried by 25
to 14. Smeaton, though at first calling it a
“shocking” amendment, voted for it rather
than accept the strong plea of Peake and his
supporters to just refer the matter back to
Webb for further report.
W. M. Hughes, in the Freetrade Hall,
Manchester: —■
The howling wolf, finding, instead oi‘ soft flesh
that he could rend and devour with teeth like razors
and claws like swords, his own flanks' all torn and
bloody, panting with rage and fear, bleats like a
sheep.
Whereupon the audience arose as one don-
key and brayed with a thistle-sharpened
voice.
Beeby, N. S. Wales Minister for Industry
—of all things in the world—being lunched
largely on imported food at the Hotel Aus-
tralia, told his audience that after the war
this country must no longer hope for
foreign loans. “Its finance must be self-
contained,” said the Minister for Industry
of all things in the world, “and it can only
pull through by the united efforts of all
classes of the community to largely increase
its wealth production.” Then Beeby, having
left off production for six months by grant-
ing himself a holiday on full pay at the
expense of all classes of the community, put
his things by his own united efforts in his
self-contained carpet-bag en route for the
U.S., leaving Australia to pull through with-
out him.
The primitive device of election by a bare
majority scored another victory for machine
politics at Swan (W.A.). The Labor candi-
date secured the seat with one-third of the
votes because the non-Labor vote was split
among three candidates. There is one solid
reason why the real Labor vote never splits.
Any Laborite who opposes the machine can-
didate is disqualified from being a machine
candidate for a long term of years—in other
words, he is victimised. There is no
Prussian drill-sergeant authority to do that
sort of thing with the other parties, and
discipline wins over mere numbers.
Little Dr. Maloney, who sits for Mel-
bourne in the Reps., moved an amendment to
Watt’s Electoi’al Bill, to introduce the initi-
ative, referendum and recall. Maloney would
like to abolish general elections and allow a
member to retain his seat until at least 30
per cent, of his constituents gave him the
recall, when a referendum would select him
again or return a fresh candidate. It’s a
cheerful notion; the trouble is that most
members are elected by bare majorities, so
that 30 per cent, of voters would enthusiasti-
cally recall the man elected (generally on a
minority vote) the day after the polling
result was known, and life would be all one
blessed by-election. It is too much joy.
City-councillor Charles Atkins, back in
Melbourne from doing his whack in
England, brought some progressive muni-
cipal ideas with him. He proposed
at the last meeting that a proper
ballot should be held when electing the
city’s Chief Bumble, and pointed out that
the present method, which is attended each
year by so much clawing and backbiting and
furious speech, is based on an Act of 1842.
The Council, however, merely grunted at the
proposal. Some of it didn’t even bother to
get up out of its wallow to vote on the
reform, which was duly thrown out quick
and hard.
N. S. Wales Premier Holman announces
that electoral law amendment won’t be made
a party question, so members may vote
according to their honest opinions. On
party questions, of course, they vote accord-
ing to something else.
Parties are unanimous in agreeing that
they are themselves perfect, and all the
troubles arise through the infamy of the
other fellow. Otherwise they wouldn’t be
parties. Thus the N. S. Wales Coal and
Shale secretary announces that his union
has spent £30,000 during the last 12
months to support miners and their
families who are out of work owing
to the employers’ brutal methods of
“victimisation.” Yet the most brutal em-
ployer wouldn’t victimise even the Devil if
he had a job for him and there was money
GIVING HIM A HINT.
MISS PEACE: “Do yon see any green in my
eye?"
in the job. He would rather set his
grandmother to shovelling coal when there
was a rush of profitable orders than see the
old lady victimised. But the export of coal
has fallen off about 75 per cent, for want of
ships, and the demand for coal in our own
shipbuilding industry—for the making of
steel plates, engines, etc. —is not »worth men-
tioning. As for the demand in other indus-
tries it is rather diminishing than ir>cren«-
ing, for Labor, including the Coal and
Shale Union, always gives its tacit support
to the importing party and discourages local
coal-users. Even the railways, for want
of the rolling-stock- which apparently can’t
be built under the conditions which a long
spell of Labor Government hasn’t im-
proved, are cutting down their mileage and
their coal demand wholesale. So the brutal
colliery proprietor, who hasn’t sufficient
voting power to alter these things, must
sack somebody. If he sacks, and forces
on to the union funds men he dislikes
rather than men he specially likes, it is
much the same to the union funds. Some
day a sane Parliament will prohibit the
export of coal altogether, and it can’t be
done too soon. The known supplies are
very, very poor considering the size of the
country. And they are all wanted for the
industries of the future, for Australia isn’t
a land of abundant water-power. When
the situation is realised prohibition of ex-
port is inevitable, and Labor had better
consider this matter and get a move on its
fiscal policy.
The controller should have something to
say about the use of paper in taking ballots.
A vast amount of stationery and enough
labor to build two houses must have been
expended in taking that vote of the unions as
to whether the Hun should or should not pay
an indemnity to Servia for damage apart
from the destruction of buildings, and now
there is talk of a ballot to select a Labor
delegate to the Peace Congress to which he
has one chance in a million of being invited.
Re paper, there is a fair chance that some of
the nations from which Australia draws its
supplies may prohibit the export one of these
days. The U.£s. has been taking stock, and
one result is that magazine paper, as apart
from the flimsy stuff on which dailies are
printed, is now eating up 500 square miles of
forest per year. A little of the forest is re-
planted, but much of the ground is used for
cattle, sheep and wheat; and what is re-
planted takes perhaps a dozen years to grow,
and it costs more than the stuff that cheap
old Nature furnished. Labor ha s to be paid
for, while Nature worked gratis. There may
be a cold time by-and-bye for the Archi-
median lever in countries that don’t make
their own paper.
“Solo”: Something in the way of an ex-
planation seems due about the benefits de-
rived by the State from duplicating the
transactions of P. Enterprise. Last year
the Bananaland Government set up a pro-
duce agency in Brisbane, and provided
£lO,OOO for working account, the alleged pur-
pose of the agency being to “store, sell and
distribute produce for the producer.” Very
well. The statement of accounts just
issued for the period in which the agency
lias been operating
shows that purchases
of produce were
made to the extent
of £15,014 and goods
received on consign-
ment to the value of
£7608. A gross pro-
fit on the merchan-
dise account was
made of £1066; the
commission earned
as agent, was £442.
This was all for
three months. Trans-
lated into a term of
12 months the arith-
metic would mean
this: That on a
turnover of £98,000
a gross profit would
be shown of £6032
—that after extract-
ing salaries and
wages amounting to
£3032, £lOOO for
“trade expenses.”
rent, interest, insur-
ance, cost of advts.,
stationery and so on
there would be a net
profit of £6BO. If
operations of this
sort mean anything
else than doing what
P. Enterprise is per-
petrating in every
street, and often for
a smaller rake-off.
someone ought to
state what it does
mean. Apparently
if Ryan hadn’t gone in for profit-mongering
out of produce lie would have lost £896 in
three months; but where is the difference ‘
la tween profit-mongering by the State and
the same thing by an individual?
“A.T.S.” : The statement by “C.R.W.” (B.
17/10/T8) that Langdon Bonython “initi-
ated the Protection policy in S. Australia” is
not correct. In the late ’sixties, before Bony-
thon was heard of, John A. Nortlnnore, draper
(father of Judge Nortlnnore, of W.A.) ;
Jjphn Clark, tailor: A. AY. Dobbie, machin-
ist; David Gall, printer; Robert Cottrell,
coach builder; and many others battled for
Protection. As a boy then, over 50 years
ago, I attended Protection meetings in the
Hotel Europe Hall, Gawler-place, where the
Y.M.C.A. now is. Robert Cottrell was
elected for East Adelaide as a Protectionist,
arid managed to get a few low Protective
duties. The battle was continued and in
1876 Allerdale Grain ger arrived, and the
following year founded the Australian
Star, a weekly which ran for some years,
preaching Protection. Grainger got into
Parliament. In 1884 the Advertiser, then
owned by Burden and Bonython. got rid of
editor Jeff Stow (who was provided with a
magistracy at Port Pirie) and turned over
to Protection, but Fred Burden had as much
to do with the change as Bonython.
BREAKS OF GAUGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The report of railway engineers on the break-of-
g'aug'e devices condemns the whole 126 of them. Of
course, the third rail is possible, and, maybe, a
fourth rail would be possible likewise, but it would
certainly be costly.” —Daily paper.
They brought us their reports. We read them all;
And then we paused in expectation high.
Strong promises the statesmen’s lips let fall;
The public watched with an unwinking eye.
Then they forgot and let the matter stand;
And war came on and various other things
Till merely local matters all were banned
Amid the breaking thrones of distant kings,
Then the inventors tried a simple game
Of adding one to two and making four;
And all worked out the sum about the same,
As no d —d use to take an engine o’er.
And so the simple thing the public knew
Remains for future use on mental ice
That two divided into two times two
Will always go most accurately twice.
The time for some reports has come again.
The schemes and systems in their hundreds fail.
Some genius must arise to make it plain
That goods and soldiers cannot go by rail
As quickly when we have a break of gauge
As when the gauges have been standardised.
The old reports are dead. Write a new page,
lixplain the same old thing, and look surprised.
The job of engineers is to report;
The job of politicians to sit tight.
The public pays at last for all the sport;
And while the gauges wait we take to flight.
The aeroplane may solve the thing at last;
There is no break above the fleecy clouds ;
And wheels may run on nothing far and fast
With homing wool and holidaying crowds.
Someone might write a full report of that
Describing magic circles in the air,
The while the gauges ’neath the statesman’s hat,
Call for insistent and complete repair.
The true report would be a simple thing
If some bold engineer, who would not shirk
Mis duty to the public, dared to fling
This in his talking masters’ teeth —“Get work!”

BILL (jokingly): “What are you doing in
the great war. Digger?”
JIM (after ten miles of it) : “Doin’! I
think I'm doin’ a ’orse out of a job!”
“Geo. D.” : Tell “Merrigal” (T>. 20/0/’
that the Barkunji tribe of abos. did not inhabit
both sides of the Darling- from Bourke to Tilpa.
The Darling was the boundary-line between the
Barkunji and the Kamilaroi. The Kamilaroi country
extended from Victoria to Queensland, but the river
divided the tribe from the Barkunji, and the language
spoken was entirely different—mark the word
language, not dialect. The Kamilaroi headquarters
were on Yanda, even in the time of the Bogan River
Co., which first took up the country from Bourke to
Louth, and the tribe ranged for “walk about” and
tucker from near where the Bogan joins the Darling
along to Bvrock, thence to near Cobar and thence to
about Louth. The Barkunji “walk about” was from
the Culgoa to liillara and up the Paroo to Nockeleehe. I
well remember a peace delegation from the Kamilaroi
to the Barkunji. The Kamilaroi crossed the river
to a Barkunji camp on the Warrego, near
where the present Tooralla homestead stands, and
came on the opposition camp down the wind,
carrying burning bunches of gum-leaves. They spoke
by sign language. The tribe of Kamilarois on Yanda'
was subdivided into four, two mobs living in the
back country, and two on the river. The back country
men or women came on to the fiver occasionally, but
they couldn’t swim. The two sections living on the
river were canoeists, and could swim like ducks and
dire like the “teedmal” (diver). As to “Merrigal’s”
abo. prescriptions, the marshmallow is an introduc-
tion, and his acquaintance with the abos.’ pharma-
copoeia must be recent. Chewed gum-leaf poultice
plastered with mud was universally used for wounds,
and a native quinine for any sort of fever. “Ida
D.” (B. 17/10/’IS) speaks of a “towri.” What is
towri ? The Kamilaroi throughout the different dia-
lects used the word “nirri” for dog or dingo. The
terminal “bri,” of many abo. words, does not mean
water, but watery, as “millbri”—watery eye. Bone
is another terminal, such as bopilbone. Bopil, a
feather, and bone added makes the word “feathery.”
The word for grey or blue kangaroo was “murro-
way,” and the black kangaroo “womboy.” The
word for boomerang was any old word but boomer-
ang. The Kamilaroi tribe I knew called it pulkar
among many other names.

“Pick”: This was my experience of the
beneficial effect that iron produces on non-bearing
fiuit-trees. I had transplanted two fig suckers
from an abandoned orchard. They grew well, but
regularly went on strike during the fruit season.
An expert recommended cutting their tap-roots, so 1
got to them with the axe. The next and succeeding-
summers they had loads of fruit, which all fell off
before ripening. Then I made a clothes-line post
of one of the Slackers, and, to fasten the line, I
drove through him a long, rusty iron bolt. After
that the fruit on the vegetable riper.e 1 luxuriantly,
though his neighbor still shed a green crop.

“D.”: “Pupper” Best owned a fine farm in
the Pan valley, and took credit to himself for its
many perfections j but as a matter of fact Best never
die* anything but drift round with his hands in his
pockets from one job to another, telling his sons or
his wife or his daughters to do what they were
already doing, and how to do it, which, as it invari-
ably happened, was precisely the way they were doing
it. Best s idea was that he was absolutely essential
to the very existence of the farm, for which reason
ho could hardly be induced to take an eye off it.
Uis fear was that it might evaporate, or sink, or blow
4 way in his absence. His eternal declaration was:
“No dash fear, I can’t leave
my place. Soon ez my
back's turned things start
goin’ wrong. I did go to
Melbin onest, ’n’ a fireball
come along ’n’ killed me
best cow. Never again!”
Best’s theory was that the
successful administration of
a farm called for the un-
divided attention of an acute
mind. To his eternal vigi-
lance success was due. The
Best Doys, with the able
assistance of the Best girls,
were clearing the dam-pad-
dock, with the intention of
increasing their’ already
large acreage under crop, ■
and Best, as usual, was
volubly' insisting on them
doing just what they were
doing in the manner, the
time and the place in which
it was being done, greatly
to his own satisfaction. The
boy's were using dynamite on
the tougher stumps, and one
night before retiring Dick
put a few plugs in the
kitchen oven to lie pliable
for the making of charges on
the following morning. But
in the morning the dynamite
was overlooked, and a fire
was lit on the oven. The
explosion that followed caught Pupper Best
as he was seating himself to breakfast. There
are various reports of the height, to which Best was
carried, but however protracted his aerial journey-
may have been he came to earth comparatively
unhurt, gazed upon the ’mischief wrought in his
absence, the hole in his house, the ruin of his kitchen,
the wreck of his breakfast, his overturned tank, his
dead cat, his injured wife, his lame son, and ejacu-
lated feebly: “There, what’id I tell yeh? ’N’ I
wasn’t off the farm five flamin’ minutes !’’
“Boro-Belle” : Witnessed a fight in North
Queensland between two turtles. Each weighed in
at about three-quarters of a ton. It was a moon-
light night and I was searching the beach for
turtle-eggs when I heard the preliminary thumps-.
The pair had a big ring scooped out and as the
fight progressed showers of sand were tossed up by

their whirling flappers. They occasionally lifted
themselves up on their rear end and tried to come
down- with a ponderous bump on each other’s head.
The smacks on their shell-roofs could be heard above
the booming of the ocean surf. The first round
lasted half an hour and both boxers breathed like
bullocks in the branding-yard. I got tired of
the row and left. It seemed likely to last as long as
the argument between Billy Hughes and George V.
as to whose turn it is to wear the crown.
“See Gee”: Talking about the weight of
bullocks, I notice that 3701 b. is offered as the best.'
Records that I have give the confectionery to W. Col-
ston, of Barnawatha (Vic.), who, in 1878, had an
animal that turned 3941 b. It went 6ft. lin. high and
its body was lift. 9in. long when eight years old. *
“Simon” : In the’eighties, when the late John
Barry kept a hotel. at Mudgee (N.S.W.), he varied
things by running coaches and mail-contracting.
Mudgee-Hill End was the principal
route, and on this run that saw many
a broken man and team on, Tucker’s
Hill and the Sugar Loaf, John was
mighty particular as to whom he em-
ployed. Once, however, he made a
mistake. Answers were O.K. to every
question he asked the applicant, but
he forgot to inquire if the stranger
■ could read and write. Soon after the
newcomer took over the .job* mailbags
were being delivered at butchers’-shops
and sausages were following each
other through the post. Sometimes
letters were found thrust back into
the original sender’s box. Brown, of
Tambaroora, traced four letters and a
pint of kerosene to Jones’s, and pulled
the said Jones’s nose. Neighbors, too,
had come to opening each other’s
letters—at first in mistake, afterwards
in , retaliation. In the midst of all
this John got a letter from the P.M.G.
demanding him to explain how the
police oathg to find ope of his
Majesty’s mailbags in the water-
trough at the pub. Then John
got busy, and the fragments of the casual have not

among the festive dancing-birds of the plains. Some
students contend that biolgas can live 150 years.
They are rarely kept as pets, whereas the white

feathered inhabitant, is a favorite cage-bird, and
numerous opportunities are given of accurately meas

of time; but in very old age cocky loses his

a ..bedraggled feather sticking out here-and there.

“Mama”: The Trobriand Islands (Papua)
are remarkable from a scientific standpoint in that
nearly every shell found within the waters of the
group carries a pearl of some sort. Both univalves
and bivalves are pearl-producers; even the
green snail and the helmet-shell often furnish a
stone. Red, white, pink, yellow, cream and black
pearls can be found within the group; the pink and
the red variety are rarely, if ever, found anywhere
•else than in Papuan waters. Should the scheme of the
Chinese to artificially raise pearls come to anything
commercially, the place to try out the idea would
be within the Trobriands. Fancy owning a pearl-

N.S.W.
Where my lone camp is set —you bet
It is no paradise—
The only one who comes to get
Assurance that I’m livin’ yet,
Is Mucki, from the rise.
He’s seven feet from tip to tip,
An’ black with yellow bands;
llis tail would make a bullock whip,
An’ he can take a mighty grip
W ith his clawed feet an’ hands.
His neck is showing green and mean;
He’s gettin’ old an’ slow;
lie’s not a beauty, fat or lean;
Hor is he nearly half as clean
As some reptiles I know.
But he beguiles a grey long day,
When summer’s on the land;
An’ in his quaint gohanna way
He listens to the things I say
An’ seems to understand.
•lust when 'the cowbells chime meal-time
He ambles up to me;
An’ that old lizard in his prime
Amuses like a pantomime
An’ keeps me company.
For tasty scraps to eat he’ll bleat,
An’ fossick in an’ out;
A fatty hide to him’s a treat,
An’ rotten eggs an’ putrid meat
The choicest things about.
His manners, I admit, don’t fit
Among the squeamish kind.
An’, sometimes, when I have to quit
The festive board, lie crosses it
An’ leaves a wreck behind.
Still, on the whole, we do agree
Together fairly well;
A little iciness, maybe,
Springs up betwixt himself an’ me,
Which passing hours dispel.
But, ere the frosts can tinge the rye-
Grassed valleys, he selects
llis winter bed an’ says good-bye;
An’ then I miss his blinkin’ eye
Till Mucki resurrects.

The indefatigable Professor MacMillan
Brown, of Maoriland, has come to the conclusion,
as the result of recent investigations in Hawaii, that
he was in error in thinking that the Polynesians
catne originally from the Malay Archipelago and India.
His idea now is that they came through Japan. The
Japs of to-day are, he explains, descendants of Ainu,
who come through Siberia and chased out the local
inhabitants. The dispersed people filtered down
through the Mariannes and Carolines into Polynesia.

“Eddyson” : Talking about the things one
meets in the dark. Gaskill was coming across from
Ironstone to the Skewbald Hills in the hope of pick-
ing up a job on the new line. He had put in at the
Small Horse Inn at Pickfield, by the way, and dissi-
pated his estate. With fourpence in coppers, an
utterly inadequate flask of anonymous rum and a
detestable head he resumed the long track, and at
about half-past eight on the evening of the eleventh,
with an empty flask, sitting in the sick glow of the
camp-fire, mourning his loss, he received the first
call. Gaskill heard the crisp patter of little feet on
the dry leaves, and saw the black, tweaking, sensitive
muzzle sniffing at him from between the tussocks of
speargrass, and caught the metallic glint of two
eyes, and then the visitor shouldered into full view.
He was a small black pig, with three white legs, and
one comic orb isolated in a diamond, like the White-
eyed Kaffir. But what gave Peter Gaskill great con-
cern of mind was the fact that the pig' was wearing
an absurd, small straw hat tied with pink strings
under his jaw, and an utterly ludicrous pair of
shepherd’s plaid pants, out of which his small tail
curled with an effect of low comedy that failed to
connect, for Peter Gaskill was in a complication
bordering between incredulity and cold terror. The
small, plump pig advanced and tweaked his nose with
amiable humor across the fire. Gaskill was convinced
he winked. So human was the general effect that
Gaskill responded to an instinct and spoke: “Well,
what is it ?” said he. His voice was tremulous, his
heart was tamping his ribs like a hammer. The pig
did an extraordinary thing—he took up a piece of
burning root in the cleft of his left trotter, placed the
unlit end in his mouth, reared up on his hams and
smoked,! Gaskill uttered a yell and moved back, Gaskill
was not ordinarily a superstitious or unduly sensi-
tive soul, but Gaskill was not well and he had
imagined himself alone in the black bush. The cry
brought the little pig on all-fours again. He moved to
GaskiH’s side of the fire. Gaskill revolved on his
own axis in his eagerness to keep his distance. Then
the pig, using his right fore trotter as a marker,
wrote on the bare earth. Gaskill saw the marks, but
did not dare to read them. It drifted across his
mind that the Devil had sent a comic agent to set
his fate before him. Suddenly the wretched man
realised that ladies were present. Two ducks had
joined the pig. The ducks were white, they wore
little black poke-bonnets, and had Elizabethan ruffs
about their necks, and striped stockings on their
legs, and they bowed towards Gaskill with old-world
ceremony, and one said something. Here Gaskill’s
little remaining courage deserted him ; he scrambled
to his feet, and ran blindly through the trees, know-
ing that Satan was hot after him in the shape of a
little black pig in a small straw hat. Gaskill went
over the rails and fell into the Old Mine-road, and,
incidentally, on top of a man sleeping close to where
a shaggy pony was tethered to an old covered cart.
The man jumped out of his sleep, and went for
Gaskill, lunging furiously with a bottle. Peter
fought for dear life in the dust, through the a-'es
of a camp-fire, into the litter of a recent meal, and
then, having his man under and done up, he beheld
by the cart the solemn visage of a bearded, nan ; -
archal, five-legged goat. He had camped in tne
vicinity of a debauched travelling showman. The
little black pig was only the star performer in a
menagerie of freaks, out seeking sustenance.
“Jim Carew”: “Pick” (B. 25/7/18) is off
the lines when he says that a . streamer from the
throat-strap will protect a horse from the bot-fly.
Experience with horses has taught me that
“Pick” is committing perjury. One sure
method of keeping the bot-fly out is to
sponge over the lower jaw of the horse with
a mixture of olive-oil and rape-oil. When I used
this I had about 90 per cent, less cases of horses
attacked than when I used the streamer. Re the
argument as to whether the bot-fly . stings or not.
There is no argument. It stings. This can easily be
proved with a strong magnifying-glass.

Shepherd : Does any Abo. know a
dozen birds which destroy more insects than this lot:
straw-necked ibis, magpie, pee wee, happy
family, owls, blue wren, thrush, willy-wagtail,
Australian bustard or plain-turkey, quail and
kookaburra? These birds have voracious appetites,
and devour great quantities of crop-destroying insects,
while the owl and jackass add plenty of snakes’
lizards and other crawling pests to their menus’.
About the only things they can’t swallow are the
Federal Government’s price-fixing jokes.

town John Barry, an old coaching identity in the pre-

was known as The Pasha, supervised for the firm all over

whose business took them over the mountains.
Amongst these were James Martin, C.J. The Pasha
was 86 when he went out. He owned and ran race-
horses at many country meetings. The best of his

Lachlander”: Garstang’s homestead was
right alongside the main north road, and was well
known to travellers. Garstang was equally as well
known for his hospitality. So lavish was lje with his
whisky that he had even been known to bestow it on
peregrinating tea-agents, despite the remonstrations
ot the local parson, who was touched on a sore
spot by this misapplication of good liquor. The old
chap was also a J.P., and ,by reason of this always
entertained the police magistrate on his monthly
round—and did it in style. When the new
P.M. arrived recently it was discovered that he had
been transferred from a western district, and was a
fiercer tippler than his predecessor; one of those
whole-souled drinkers that could extract more enjoy-
ment from a Sunday spree than a
preacher could from a score of
Sunday-school picnics. Garstang
did not know this when word was
received that Mr. Strake, the newly-
appointed P.M., was to visit his
home. But there were guests in
the house when the word came
through, and they proceeded to put
their host wise to the position.
“Look here,” said Mack, “this new
P.M. is a temperance crank, one of
the bigoted kind that would leave
your home if you offered him a drop
of grog. Keep it away from him
and never mention whisky in his
presence, or he’ll clear across to Rob-
son s. It only needed the mention
of Robson’s name to decide Gar-
stang, and when the magistrate
arrived he was promptly regaled
with lirnejuice. He had it throughout
the day, and when Garstang, after
my-teriously winking towards the
c ur guests, side-stepped to the
cei r for a nip, there was consider-
able trouble in dodging Strake. If.
a gl iss clinked in a room the P.M.
would suddenly open the door, peer
in, and ap lugise profusely. The
guests drank under great difficulty
all that day. On the following
morning Strake prepared to say
farewell. He had intended to re-
main a week, but he explained that
an appointment called him away.
Garstang drove him down the road
for a mile. At the turn-off the
P.M. stopped the trap and produced
a flask. Said he to Garstang, “Have
a drink ? There’s only two nips
loft and I kept them for a
farewell between the two of us.” Garstang gasped.
M hy, he stuttered, “they r told me you were a
teetotaller. “A what?” said his Worship. The
pace that nag put up on its way back to Garstang’s
would have been a record but for the weight of two
gigantic thirsts in the trap.

■ •’ Ihe flame-breasted robin (Petroica
phcenica) usually arrives on Monaro (N.S.W.) high-
lands about the end of autumn, coming, it may be,
from far Tasmania. To see the flame-breast at his
best you must catch him perched on a thistle, stand-
ing above Monaro snows, then his blue-grey coat and
yellowish-scarlet vest are thrown out in strong relief.
I have never met the red-capped' robin (Petroica
goodenovii) either on Monaro or in the Bega
(coastal) district immediately below, but the rare
rose-breasted robin haunts the coastal gullies, especi-
allj those flanked by dense scrubs and sassafras and
tea-tree jungles. The male rose-breast wears a vest
°‘ color of the meat of a Japanese plum (not
persimmon); but his missus has to be content with an
apron of faint pink. The neat cup-nest, adorned with
mosses and lichen, is usually built close to some
secluded creek. Have met this rare scrub-lodger also
about Mittagong; but, like the red-cap, he avoids
arctic Monaro. The hooded robin (Petroica bicolor)
is another somewhat rare fowl, but once he finds
a suitable residence—generally a spot on which the
timber is rung and dead, he seems to stick to it and
breed there season after season. The South Coast
(N.S.W.) is a haunt. The male is a parson-like bird;
the female, Quakerish in attire. Two eggs of deli-
cate bluish-green zoned with brown at the larger
end, form the hooded robin’s clutch, but somehow
the birds (from writer’s experience) seem rarely
to succeed in rearing more than one chick. The
young are brought early to the ground and reside,
until able to fly strongly and shift for themselves, in
clumps of bracken and other short cover. They are
thus at the mercy of various enemies, like the fox
and the gohanna.

“N.E.H.”: “I was with a party of sur-
veyors working up North one time,” he said. “We
went miles and miles inter the bush, and another
lot of surveyors wus working nearer town. They had
a new-chum with them who wus making a nuisance
of himself, and before we left they gave us fair
notice they’d send him on to us to get rid of him.
We didn’t see him for a couple of days, and began to
think he’d got himself lost, go we started to look
for him. Three nights later we had all the abori-
gines and swaggies we could collect hunting for him.
Finally we reckoned he was dead, and while we were
looking for his body one of the blokes helping us
asked us his name. We told him Bob Jones. ‘Strike
me!’ says he. ‘That’s my name.’ The damn fool
was looking for himself all the time.”
“F.G.L.”: Here's a home recipe guaran-
teed to k.o. the most obstinate dyspepsia that ever
spoiled a bloke’s enjoyment of his grub: three pen-
n’orth each of bitter aloes, essence dandelion, tinc-
ture aniseed, tincture gentian and Peruvian bark;
three packets Epsom, two sticks Spanish liquorice!
Boil aloes and liquorice in quart of water till
liquorice dissolves. Add remainder of ingredients
after taking off fire —bar the aniseed. Strain through
muslin, and when cold add aniseed. Dose, one tea-
spoonful after meals in water. Can specially recom-
mend it to my cobbers of the bush, where the habit

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Deep within the leaves’ soft gloaming
Of a far secluded vale,
Fretted by the insects roaming
O'er its surface, amber pale,
Lies the pool so often stirred
By thy plumes, 0 lonely bird.
Slants of shadowy gold-green splendor,
Shifting with each radiant hour,
Build among the branches slender
An ethereal sunbow bower,
Where thou reigneth like a king,
Thy rich plumage shimmering.
Splendid bird, to see thee flitting
Through the shadowy lights and hues
Vivid as a gem, or sitting
In a glow of living blues,
With thy vital black eyes bright
Fills and thrills me with delight.

•Tones, but even solid men from -Tasmania
and Maoriland, explain genially, in after-
dinner speeches, how the much-abused British
Censor is only a weak amateur compared to
the down-under brand. For example,
Arnold Bennett holds a Government position :
but that in no way prevents him from con-
tributing many signed articles to the Daily
News, attacking the Lloyd George Cabinet
in his best incisive style. It is doubtful il
even in France there is anything like _ the
freedom of Fleet-street. British writers
complain loudly enough about gags and stop-
pers, but little do they know how well oft
they are. _ .
Fleet-street can never quite lose its quaint
fascination. In the taverns, though beer is
like barley-water and an old English cut
from the joint” a thing of the past, you may
still meet some old newspaper man. the last
of the Bohemians, who knows everything and
has been everywhere, but regards any world
beyond Fleet-street as unreal and illusory.
LOUIS ESSON.
The Australian Book
“E.S.S.” : One wonders if tlie current wave
of patriotism will be reflected henceforth in
our literature and book trade. Its literature
is everything to a nation, and the patriotism
of retailers and publishers is everything to
the makers of that literature _ when the
country is young. This phase is not very
evident yet. Except by the house that pub-
lishes it, the Australian book is not pushed
in the way English and American books are.
It is usually stored away on a back shelf
where only a diligent hunter discovers it,
whilst he has to enter the premises carefully
to avoid falling over the others. Often a
good Australian is not stocked at all; nor is
any information concerning it given to in-
quirers beyond the damaging remark that
there is not much sale for it. The customer
is then shown something American or Eng-
lish, which is praised at great length. These
books are also specially listed as “worth
reading.” and starred in every manner pos-
sible. When a book is published in London
or New York the local houses usually take
it up without bias. All of them stock it,
sparingly or abundantly, according to re-
views. As booksellers in other lands make
a feature of local productions, it is only
right that our own booksellers should do the
same with Australian books. Thev owe that
to the country which provides them with
their bank accounts.
“The Oldest Inhabitant’s” old-timer: —
An old-time George-street (Sydney) bookseller,
Jeremiah Moore, was a quaint character in his way. He
started trading at a stall erected against the wall of
the old cemetery, where now stands the Town Hall.
Jerry was a cordwainer by trade, and conducted this
business under a canopy alongside his bookstall.
Also, you could read a book while he repaired your
shoes. Later he made enough money to build a.
three-storey house right opposite, where for many
years he conducted a big business. A story one time
went the round of the local booksellers that in Ins
shop one day he escorted a lady to where a ladder,
with an assistant on top of it. stood against the
bookshelves. “Denny,” said Jerry to his assistant,
“hand Mrs. Malone the ‘lvay of Heaven.’ ” “The Key
of Heaven” was a book of Catholic prayer.
The Inky Way
Edward Dyson got a compliment lately,
down Hobart way. A local scholar was lec-
turing on “The Short Story in English,
American and Australian Literature.” As
illustrations he recited stories from Kip-
ling and O. Henry, and a yarn of Dyson s
which appeared in The Bulletin a while
back —“The Coming of Henry.” A vote was
taken at the close as to which was the best.
From a crowd of about 200 Kipling got two
votes, O. Henry 25 and Dyson the rest.
“Y.Z.” : Is young Guy Innes’s performance
an Australian journalistic record? It seems
only the other day that he was a cub re-
porter on the Argus, beginning to excite
respect by his alertness as a news-gatherer
and his neat talent for topical versification,
and now, while still a comparative youngster,
he is editor-in-chief of a big daily, having—as
previously recorded —stepped into Jack
Davidson’s shoes as literary boss mandarin
on the Melbourne Herald. Has any other
Australian journalist climbed to the editorial
chair of an important daily at so early an
age, and with —I shan’t say so small—so
short an experience of the intricate business
of handling a big news journal ?
Announced that the big bookselling firm of
George Robertson and Co. will close in June
next. Reasons given are the shortage of
books and paper, and apprehension re the
proposed licensing system, to restrict impor-
tation. The firm seems assured that this
will be carried. Those who are putting
up the shutters believe that there will
be a paper shortage for some time after
the war. The business was founded in lbou
by Robertson. He and Mullen were book-
sellers’ assistants together in London.
Charlie Bean, official correspondent with
the A.1.F., tells in the October Austral-
asian Journalist of the peculiar luck ex-
perienced by his fellow-correspondent Cut-
lack. The Huns picked Cutback out for
special attention one day when lie was going
forward by himself to get particulars of a
recent attack. One of the bunch of whiz-
bangs sent over landed at his feet, but didn t
explode. Cutlack got through all right, and
shortly went on leave. In the first week he
broke his arm in a collision with a small boy
on a bike! The break had to have three
separate settings and Cutlack finished up
with a tedious stretch in hospital.
“Vic”: The closing of the George Robert-
son firm revives memories of bygone Mel-
bourne booksellers. The oldest in my ken
were the rivals Dwight and Bennett, both in
Bourke-street, and both dealing most in the
second-hand. Mrs. Bennett was a clever
woman, who managed while her husband
bought in London. Dwight s establishment,
at the top of the street, was more ambitious.
Here the learned bookworms would go for
anything special. Cole ultimately bought
this business, and carried it on for a while
in connection with his first small Arcade.
Then he bought the Spanish Restaurant,
which became the big Arcade and held all his
stock. Other booksellers were Buzzard and
Vale, in Bourke-street, and Caple, afterwards
Stephens, in Collins-street. Coppin was in
Caple’s shop when he heard of the loss ot
Brooke in the steamer London.
One of the booklets that Robert Louis
Stevenson used to turn out at Samoa, in the
closing years of his life, was lately sold in
London for. the Red Cross. It is a skit on
his fellow-novelist Rider Haggard,, then
(1892) becoming famous. The title is “An
Object of I’ity, or the Man Haggard,” and
the copy sold is supposed to be unique, or
thereabouts.
“Hamer”: Quite a lot of minor journals
in Britain have reduced themselves to very
slightly camouflaged lotteries ; and the game
seems to be a paying one. The sixpenny
limerick competition that had a bit of a
vogue in Australia still flourishes: and there
are “competitions” of all sorts. With your
twopenn’orth of paper you get a chance :df
competing in from one to half a dozen gam-
bles with prizes running up to £lOOO. Some-
times a sixpenny postal-order Rns to accom-
pany the gambling coupon, and sometimes it
is only necessary to attach the slip of paper
that sliows a meatwrap has been purchased.
These papers, without worrying much about
the value of the contents, can proudly
announce that “our circulation has now
reached two millions,” and the paper benefits
not only from sales, but from its
increased value as an advertising medium.
In the meantime there is an outcry about
paper-shortage aud a shortage of labor every-
where. But nobody seems to worry about
this vast waste.
From the Colhirenebri Chronicle: —
A large number of old subscribers have not got
“Paid” against their names in our books. We sent
the paper to two gentlemen—Messrs. and
[names given in the .Chronicle] , but, though they
accepted the “rag” for three months, when we sent on
our account they declined to “part up.” Of course
the law would make them if we eared to take pro-
ceedings, but it’s not worth while. We might sug-
gest that they put the amount in—6s. 6d. each—
towards the purchase of a War Loan Bond.

Great sadness is upon the house,
Grim are the children all,
And e’en the customary mouse
Gnaws not the cupboard wall.
The wife goes creeping like a cat
To polish and to sweep,
The house dog’s curled upon the mat.
Scarce breathing in his sleep. "■«.
Appeal is made to Brown next door,
And Hagan’s Irish flock,
To still their noise, and play no more.

Who dare not cry hia woe ;
The milkman stills his clamor wild,
The baker comes tip-toe
Yet pain’s not dumb, and passion speaks,
And groans well all the time
From that dread room where father seeks
The still elusive rhyme!

A Satchel of Books
A Romance of the Western Front, by Gabrielle M.
Vassal (William Heinemann, London). This book is
mainly a romance of commonplace proceedings in the
Divorce Courts. - A lady’s husband goes to the war.
She, previously infatuated with a French officer,
becomes more seriously afflicted with yearnings in
that direction, and in the first chapter throws herself
at him. The rest is all about the pubs they visited,
the lodgings they enjoyed, the camps they put up
with, and so on. ' It is a tale that Adam might have
written if he had been a writer. Unfortunately he
hadn't time to be a writer.
Religio Grammatici, the religion of a “man of
letters,” by Gilbert Murray (George Allen and Unwin,
London). This is a presidential address to the
Classical Association, and moves lightly and , grace-
fully round its subject without getting to very close
grips with it. Still, the little book contains many
things worth thinking about. For instance: —-
“People talk as. if our thoughts were descended
from the fathers of our flesh, and the fountain-head
of our present literature, and art and feeling was to
be sought among the Jutes and Angles. Paradise
Lost and Prometheus Unbound are not the children
of Piers Ploughman and Beowulf: they are the
children of Vergil and Homer, of iEschylus and
Plato.”
Just so. The Jutes and Angles didn’t father much
in the way of thought or feeling, but exactly which
of the very dead ancients passed his job on to William
Shakspeare, Robert Burns or Henry Lawson? A
cowherd of Ancient Briton is just as likely to father
a man with a new mind as any classical person is to
foist a new thought upon that mind.
A tome bv Herbert Jenkins, the Adventures o ;
Bindle, arrives accompanied by 30 earlv press notices,
and the enthusiasm thereof is marvellous. One of
the fairly moderate ones says that Joseph Bindle is
the most amusing character of his kind since the
appearance of “Pickwick Papers.” The present writer
agrees—with reservations. Bindle is a. kind-hearted
Cocknev furniture-remover with varicose veins and.a
disagreeable wife. There is humor about him of a
sort. He squirts lamp-black over the white raiment
of a crowd of suffragettes. A complicated, practical
joke on his dreary brother-in-law Hearty, whose shop
is invaded and pervaded by a multitude of brass
brands and other devices, receives his support. He is
instrumental in complications whereby an actress
sleeps in the same flat with,an elderly grass-widower
who had never done Bindle any harm, and this leads
to great misery for the grass-widower. It is hinted
that in a previous volume -he had been mixed up in
an episode concerning the addition of grog to the
tea at a temperance picnic, which jest resulted in an
intoxicated clergyman turning a garden-hose on a
lady who is the typical widow of the typical vul-
garian that makes bis morev by selling some tvnical
substance like pork or oilcloth. Bindle is acquainted
with two parsons who resemble the Shepherd of
Dickens with a far-off resemblance, and are hopelessly
lackirg in the individuality of Chedband. • There
are certainly points about Birdie, but he -isn't a,
porcupine. ' The work, as already mentioned, is
written bv Herbert Jerkins, and. it is n-blisbed bv
Herbert ' Jenkins, Limited, of St. James’s, London.
the well-deserved popularitv ot Jenkins,
Limited, among the writing communitv has helped
to; popularise, the work of plain Jenkins.

Russell Grimwade. of the ancient chemist
firm of Felton, Grimwade and Co., has lat-
terly been offering some information upon
Australian eucalypts. The oils distilled from
the eucalypts, according to Grimwade, have
a very wide range, “practically from crude
turpentine to attar of roses.’’ Considering
the immense distances over which this coun-
ter has been in the habit of dragging its sup-
plies of such products, this sounds like good
news; but the foreign extracts have a tre-
mendous start, particularly in the case of the
cheaply-imported scents with a lovely, ex-
pensive-looking label and an impressive price-
tag Doreen, preparing for her weekly hop.
will liardlv look at anything that comes from
an Australian factory; and Era is at one
with Doreen on the same matter. Yet there
are several good locally-made perfumes on
the market at reasonable prices.

“Exile”: Happened to be in the United
States when shipbuilding changed from a
spasm to a rush. At a weekly luncheon of a
business-man’s club the head of a big co.
gave us a short talk about the development
of this work. The making of ships is pro-
ceeding on such a vast scale that cheap Ocean
freights are the one post-war certainty, lhc
coal and shipping industry will be the first
Australian trades to feel the effects of a new
and stupendous competition with the mercan-
tile marine of U.S. Just as the Americans
have eclipsed other manufacturing nations in
the production of automobiles, typewriters,
rifles and watches, through standardising, so
will they excel all others as shipbuilders.
Steel plates arrive at the yards from the
steel-works with every hole punched accu-
rately so that they can be fitted together
rapidly and unerringly. These plates are cut
by paper patterns previously laid out to the
actual design of the ship. The cost of a
cargo steamer in Britain averages £8 to £9 a
ton. and the same class of ship is being built
in U.S. for £6 a ton dead-weiglit. Although
skilled labor is highly paid, labor-saving
machinery is everywhere employed to an
extraordinary degree. In the handling ot
raw materials for making steeU—the iron ore
and the coal—the Americans have reached a
high pitch of efficiency with mechanical appli-
ance. For illustration, the average produc-
tion of ore per employee of the U.S. Steel
Corporation is 2200 tons yearly, compared
with the best German record of 400 tons per
man. By using modern terminal machinery
a cargo-carrier gets in and out of port
quickly, and has no idle time at anchor. On
the Great Lakes, whence the iron ore is
shipped, 18,000 tons gross can be loaded m
12 hours. In the shipping season of 280 days
in 1900 a big carrier took 300.000 tons of
freight. In 1916 a single vessel hauled
459,186 net tons. Cargo boats can be con-
structed as fast as Ford cars. The United
States will easily become the leading ship-
ping nation.

“Gleniris”: Victorian jam-makers are
looking forward to a poor fruit season,
owing to a late frost which slaughtered mil-
lions of apricots and other stone fruits in
their early infancy. Now the tip for
orcliardists is to plant any. quantity pro-
serving-melons between their rows ot truit-
trees, the British Government having decided
last year to accep t melon-ja m for the Troops.
The slug is perhaps the greatest enemy ot the
melon-plant, and he is only dangerous in the
first few weeks. After that all the vine needs
is plenty of water and lots of hoeing. Still,
the orchardist usually can’t be bothered
with such twopenny matters as melon-grow-
ing. He mostly likes to gamble on making
enough in one bumper year to carry him over
the next three or four. It’s such humble
ground-punchers, as the lettuee-and-French-
bean grower who know the value of prolific
producers like the melon and strawberry and
tomato.

“G.E.M.”: The other day I asked a Syd-
ney firm to quote me for making a common
wooden larder, say 10ft. x 6ft. high by about
2* deep—a glorified meat-safe such as you
may find in any cottage. The frame was to
bf' of hardwood, the boarding. of any soft
woods —kauri, pine, etc. Their reply was
to the effect that, not being able to get the
timber, they could not quote for the job.

A concrete jetty is being constructed at
Stansbury (S. Aus.) , the first of its kind in
that State. The piles are made entirely ot
reinforced concrete and have withstood a
very severe tesf on this job, having been
hammered with a two-ton monkey l ift-
drop) from 10 to 17 hours (one was driven
for 35 hours) and there was no indication
of fracture. Local cement was used for
the work. #
“Croson” : I lately met a friend of mine at
a Melbourne hay and corn store. He is a con-
siderable farmer, living a little way out, and
he wanted wheat for his poultry and pigs.
The price was ss. 6d. a bushel, and after .he
had bought a few bags I said something
about millionaires. He shook his top-piece
mournfully. “Look here,” he said “you know
what I have on my place. I’ve got to. feed
’em; but you know well enough there’s no
money in either fowls or pigs with wheat at
ss. 6d. I’ve just been out to Brook-
lyn. Alongside the stacks men were
digging long trenches 4ft. wide and
as many deep, and others were dumping into
them bushels on bushels of weevily and
damaged wheat. I couldn't buy a grain of
it. though I could steam it if I had it, and
it’s A 1 for fowls and pigs. Yet some d—d
idiot is paying men 12s. or 14s. a day to
bury it.” He asked me what I thought of
it, but my remarks didn’t seem to satisfy
him. He wanted somebody’s gore.
THE BEGGING-LETTER WRITERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am not rich, yet, strange to say,
The begging- letters come each day;
This morning early 1 had three,
Soliciting most ardently.
This cheeky supplicating brood
Will owe not me their gratitude.
Their style is terse, with one input—
“ Demand immediate settlement!’'

Judge “ Adamax” Roofing by the company it keeps. Its selection for
use on the foremost big jobs of Australia offers clear proof of its
superior quality.
As a result of such severe competitive tests 120 miles of
“ Adamax” Roofing have been used by the Imperial
Government on various Wool and Wheat Depots through-
out Australia—ordered because “Adamax” has proved
itself to be “The Best Roofing that Money can Buy,”
5000 sq. yds. of “Adamax” used on C.S.A. Mine
Buildings at Kandos, N. S. Wales.
“Adamax” is the ideal Mine Building
Roofing because it resists Acids,
Gases or Chemical Fumes, and
because the elements have no
ill-effect on it.

“COLO” Tyre.
ight Points of the “COLO” Tyre
(1) TEE AD.—Corrugated, presenting small sur-
face to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TEE AD. —A great thickness of rubber, which
is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BEEAKEE STEIP, which, being made of
loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the tread
to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PTJEE ETJBBEE.—Pure Eubber is placed
under Breaker Strip.
(5) CAECASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy,
long-fibre canvas, heavily impregnated with
rubber.
(6) FULL AIE SPACE.
(7) SIDE WALLS. —Realising the severe work
tyres are called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,
as often happens in other makes of tyres after

POINT
One Melbourne daily, speaking: of a feature
of “Hello. Everybody!” at Her Majesty’s,
said that ‘‘the procession of inadequately
dressed young ladies from one egg-shell to
another was found sufficiently startling by a
none-too-susceptible audience.” Shell shock!
“Glen II.”: I am still living in hope of
seeing a comedian publicly stoushed by some-
one who, having paid to he amused, is made
an object for the amusement of others by an
offensively familiar fun-maker. In a Melb.
theatre the other evening a performer labor-
ing strenuously for laughs picked out a
venerable citizen in the front stalls,
addressed him as “Mark Twain” (a witty

FLO : “That beast of a stage manager has

illusion to liis long silvery hair and mous-
tache), and informed the audience that he
(the clown) and his victim had been on the
hurst together. With the eyes of the entire
house turned in his direction the butt obvi-
ously suffered acute discomfort, but the per-
son on the stage seemed well satisfied that he
had scored a hit. If I thought his satisfac-
tion would induce him to keep on repeating
this sort of thing until he struck a snag, I
would be prepared to tolerate his efforts
nightly for the pleasure of being present
when retribution exploded.
Ruth Jordan, the heroine of “The
Great Divide,” played nowanights by Muriel
Starr, was originally Margaret Anglin’s role.
It was played for a long time on tour in the
States by another actress well known in
Australia—Thais Lawton, of the Guy Bates
Post Co.
Primrose Caryll, daughter of the Belgian
composer Ivan Caryll, who was responsible
for the inusic of “Miss Gibbs,” “Pink Lady,”
‘The Duchess of Dantzic,” and numerous
other tuneful trifles, has arrived in Mel-
bourne, and will be seen behind the foot-
lights in the Firm’s “Goody Two Shoes”
panto.
From U.S.:—
In three weeks 683,000 dollars were raised for the
l>ed Cross by 23 performances of a single play ip
1i cities. The idea originated with Laurette Taylor,
the original “Peg o’ My Heart.” It was with her
husband’s new play “Out There” that she broke the
theatrical record. A company of star artists volun-
teered their services and paid their own expenses.
O. T. Heggie, the Australian, was one of them,
Beryl Mercer, H. B. Warner, George Arliss and
actoi-playwright G. M. Cohan were others. Before
each performance Mrs. Fisk delivered a lied Cross
monologue specially written by President Wilson.
Tickets were auctioned in advance and some tre-
mendous prices realised. Pittsburg topped the list
with 100,000 dollars. Washington, where the tour
started, made the smallest contribution, in spite of
the presence and patronage of President Wilson and
his wife.
Harrison O.”: Having seen the much-
boomed Theda Bara as Cleopatra, I am con-
firmed in my opinion that the lady is one of
the biggest—but there; let me be calm. As a
vampire” I would back Australian Gwen
Burroughs, with a little coaching, to
beat the only moderately beautiful Theda
out of sight. Nobody ever suspected Lily
Brayton of being an ideal exponent of
Antony’s pet serpent, but she was a great
deal more alluring and she acted with con-
siderably more intelligence than does the film
Cleo. Theda Bara wears several costumes
and head-dresses that are more suggestive of
a modern revue than of ancient Egypt; her
repertoire of gestures consists of about four
movements of the hands and arms, which
might mean anything from “Pass the mus-
to “Is my hat on.straight?” ; and her
favorite method of endeavoring* to induce an
admirer to yield unto temptation is to turn
her back on him, wriggle her shoulders and
look down her nose to see if her chin’s on
straight.
. “H. 0.”: Judging by the prominence
given their names in the advts., the Firm is
under the delusion that the principals in its
musical shows attract customers to the
theatre. Nothing could be further from
the truth. It is many years since the
J.C.YL. songandance companies have been so
poor in leading performers, and several re-
cent shows would have fallen down if they
had not had a few dozen capable legs to
stand on. The latest offering. “Hullo,
Everybody,” is a joyous affair as long as
chorus and ballet are in evidence; it is only
when the much-boomed principals are inton-
ing ditties (the words of which are heard
with difficulty in the front stalls) or frivolling
with the maddening precision of auto-
matons that one yearns for the good old days
before theatrical federation. The unim-
portance of these persons is indicated by the
fact that they are missing, but not missed,
from the finale, which is admittedly the
show’s most striking feature. As j.C.W.
is going in so largely for glorified vaudeville,
few would complain if the principals were
allowed to disport only in the first part and
the really-important turns by the chorus and
ballet came on after the interval, when the
comedians would have ceased from troubling
and the soubrettes be at supper.
“Yarra Ben”: Oh. these intellectuals! I
read in Melb. Herald the other evening
details of their newest movement: “In view
of the growing dissatisfaction among the
intelligent portion of the community with
the fare provided by the commercial theatres
a Theatre League has been formed in Mel-
bourne.” I wonder what the new league
wants, and what it expects to get? ' Mel-
bourne had Gregan McMahon and a band of
mummers providing the best of the world’s
drama for years for all those who cared to
see it “The intelligent portion of the
community” responded so well that Gregan
has, recently flitted to Sydney, where they
don’t talk so much of their superior intelli-
gence, and (I hope) do not grudge the price
of admission either.
“J.F.H.”: “Shanghai,” officially described
as a “spectacular operette,” whatever that
may be, is really a medley of music, dancing,
pantomime, comedy, extravaganza, gorgeous
scenery and magnificent dresses. It bears
a first-cousinly resemblance to “Chu Chin
Chow,” which is consistently adding thousands
of pounds every month to the bank balances
of Oscar Asche and Lily Brayton. “Shang-
hai’s” chief interest to Australians was
concentrated in the fact that Dorothy
Brunton was making her London ddbut. The
National Theatre, Drury-lane, was packed to
overflowing, and a large contingent of
Aussies in khaki made a mighty dernon-

stration of welcome when she made
her appearance. The girl from down-
under beamed delight, and was wound
up to the highest pitch of excellence
by the exhilarating reception. She became
a warm favorite with the Cockneys as well
as the Aussies long before curtain-fall.
Rarely have the London critics been so
unanimous and enthusiastic in the praise of
a newcomer. The Daily Chronicle said
that Miss Brunton is the seventh Australian
actress to appear on the boards of Drury
Lane during the past 12 months. Madge
Titheradge was the principal boy in the last
panto. The Beecham Opera Co., which
succeeded the panto, had a quartkte of lead-
ing Australasian vocalists, chief among
whom was the Maorilander Rosina Buck-
inann, and now Dorothy Brunton and Ivy
Shilling are associated as sister stars in
“Shanghai.”
“ J.W.”: If he ever sees it, Shaw will
enjoy the S. M. Herald’s criticism of “The
Doctor’s Dilemma,” done by the J. N. Tait
Repertory co. in Sydney last week: “Strange
to say, the nominally principal rSlev. . .is not
the most interesting.” Of course not. Shaw’s
boast is that he eliminates all love interest or
belittles it, and makes light of the leading
man. “ ‘The Doctor’s Dilemma’ might be
summed up as a Play of Frustration.” What
higher praise could G.B.S. desire? “Exam-
ine it, and you find that every aim in it
fails ; and the fifth act forms an anti-climax.”
Exactly what Shaw is playing for! “The
fatal touch of burlesque” (deliberately put
in by Shaw). “upon which the curtain falls
after the artist’s death on the stage in the
previous act is followed by the indecision of
this eminently unsatisfactory ending of a
superficially brilliant comedy-drama.” That
will refresh Shaw. We have here one of the
rare instances wherein the theatrical critic
is even more amusing than the dramatist.
“Jeelhdi” : On a recent Melbourne button-
day, Wirths’ Jumbo was ,sent out with the
idea, at first, of being a draw for the box-
rattlers. He “worked” right through his
dinner-hour and became hungry. Although
innumerable buns, bread rolls and bananas
had been fed to him by the crowd, he missed
his usual lunch of a hundredweight of hay
and began to pick up and eat bits of wood
and paper. Seeing him gathering a few
match sticks, a passer-by tossed a threepenny-
bit at Jumbo’s corns. The elephant picked
it up, put it in his mouth, but took it out
again and handed it to his keeper, “Snowy ”
who told him to drop it in the slot of the
box. Jumbo had three or four tries before
he got the hang of it, but after that he cadged
assiduously for the rest of the afternoon.
Many people who stopped to look were aston-
ished when he hooked his trunk around their
arms, and detained them until they, paid up.
He d make an impressive bad-debt collector.
“Ml”: It was bound to come. In my
youthful days on the stage the “book” for
“East Lynne” always mentioned the che-ild
as “Little William”; but the days when
little Williams were tolerated were, even
then, passed, and we knew the infant as
“Little Willie.” Upon the bill of an Eng-
lish provincial co. I happened to see the
other day, the youngster had climbed down
to reach a bit more popularity as “Little
Bill.” I _ suppose that a few lines were
thrown him to make the angel child
appear, on his way to his little deathbed,
the impish, irresnonsible kid that the modern
audience appreciates. Possibly his stage death
is now made a result of one of his infantile
stunts, for a spasm in the scene synopsis, just
before “The Death of Little Bill,” announces
“An Accident that Blights a Home.” So
is the ancient heart-throb brought close to
the homes of a newer generation. “East
Lynne” will yet be put on as a revue, with
little Billy- doing an imitation turn of the
other little Billy refusing the crown of
England from George V. with the words:
“No, George, I cannot take it. You are
doing well enough—well enough.”
“75” : The raising of the military age in
England has forced a number of chorus-girls
to look for useful jobs. In one revue alone
3G girls had to give up their work because
a much-boomc-d comedian had been called up,
and without him the show wouldn’t pay. It
is doubtful if any musical or vaudeville show
now T in Australia would he seriously affected
by the withdrawal of the principal comedian.
On the other hand, the withdrawal of the
chorus would almost certainly have the effect
of throwing the principals out of work.
“Sandgroper”: Anybody who has read
Simpsop Newlajttd's “Paving the Way” must
he struck by the thought of what a fine
motion-picture it -would make. A live Aus-
tralian yarn, by an Australian, full of actual
historical incidents and of places of great
interest to any true Aussie —the Coorong,
the Bluff, and all scenery to hand for the
asking. Isn’t it worth any local producer’s
time 1;o utilise material like this?

With little profit for an age,
Now he must leave his native sod
And make himself a future grand
In some appreciative land.

Had been a noble ornament,
Also a shining light to us,
And they agreed, with his consent,
To give the pro, in manner fit,
A complimentary benefit.
This complimentary benefit

Gus marked the vacant stalls and pit,
And in the circle rows of chairs.

“A.” Probably the most progressive district
industrially in N. S. Wales just now is that
surrounding Lithgow, notably around Port-
land and Kandos, where there is a continuous
roar of big plants. The Commonwealth Port-
land Cement Co., Ltd., has reached a stage of
national importance, having increased its old
output of 20,000 tons per annum to 150,000
tons, which is to be still further increased.
Aggregate production to date is almost a
million tons. The eo.’s own coal-mine is a
few miles away, being- connected by tram-
way, while the limestone taken from the four
quarries near at hand is carried by aerial
ropeway. The co.’s plant is generating
7000 h.p., the current working a dozen sub-
plants about the premises and in the quarries.
About 700 men are employed.
A stock-and-station agent in the West was
recently given the job of inducing settlers to
take up portions of a subdivided estate. He was
on a bonus of £2O from the owner for every
man he got to take up a block. The agent
sublet the contract to a second party, promis-
ing him £lO for each farm he got rid of.
The latter was busy, but he found time to
sublet to a third man, percentage being £5.
Hereabouts things became complicated, and
the owner of the estate withdrew it from the
original agent and sold it to the Government
for soldiers. There was great wailing in the
vicinity.
“0.L.”; The Cashmore Heath, a stretch of
country near Portland (Vic.), with an awful
record as a closer-settlement failure, was
recently nibbled at by the Repatriation De-
partment, with the result that cries of pro-
test from those who know the region have
been audible all over the State. In the old
days, when sheep were the Portland dis-
trict landholder’s main thought, the Heath
was fair grazing country, and only that. In
those times a good burning-off gave the
young grass a chance and provided thereby
a ration for a fair amount of stock; but
nowadays, owing to the influx of rabbits,
burning-off only means providing a nice bit
of fodder for bunny. As for mixed farming,
the record of the Closer Settlement Board
in that area is enough to scare off anybody
but those who reckon that the soldier must
be settled soipewhere at any cost —to the
soldier himself if necessary. The Heath lies
between Portland and Bridgewater Bay, and
some years ago was settled by the State with
quite a colony of hopeful farmers. Now
very few are left, and none of these can be
said to _be enjoying a happy lot. As for
values, if the Repatriation Department were
able to get the land at 2d. an acre and agreed
to keep the soldier-settlers entirely for five
years, some of them might make a small living
out of their labors; but the Department’s
valuers have taken a far more liberal view
than this. They took so liberal a view, in-
deed, that Groves, M.L.A., who has good
reason to know poor land when he sees it—
he represents dog-poor Dandenong—uprose
the other day in the Assembly and suggested
that the men who had led the Department
into this blind alley should be given no fur-
ther chance to repeat their performance.
“C.”: The Hun realised sooner than any-
body the value of propaganda, and he has
adopted many ingenious schemes for spread-
ing information of his own manufacture
among his enemies and the civilian popula-
tion on our side of the trenches. One day
towards the end of last year we were rent-
ing a little way behind the line in Northern
France. A gentle breeze was blowing from
the direction of the Rhine, and we saw a
small, round balloon drifting across from
Fritz’s lines. As the balloon obviously car-
ried no passenger speculation was keen as
to the nature of the visitation, but presently
the bottom dropped out of the basket and
released thousands of leaflets that glinted in
the sun as they fluttered to the ground.
They spread over miles of country and con-
tained a message in French addressed to
the civil population. The leaflets warned
the inhabitants to clear out while their luck
held, as Fritz intended to have Christmas
dinner in their towns. They didn’t clear
and the Hun didn’t spend Christmas in their
midst, but he was there for Easter. Since
then he has been kicked out and the popula-
tion has returned to the old address. I
haven’t heard of him leaving his card there
since.
“Bad Australian” complains :
A casual visit to the meat, vegetable and fish
markets gives one the impression that despite war
conditions it should be possible to connect with a
good square meal at 'a reasonable price almost any-
where in London. But just try it and see. Go into
any of the “popular” restaurants such as Loekart’s,
A.B.C. or Slater’s, and the first thing you bump
against is the solid fact that without meat and sugar
coupons you must be satisfied with a couple of
poached eggs, about 2oz. bread, a microscopic
murky-looking scone without butter, and a cup of tea
without sugar; or, alternatively, two very delicate
shavings of horribly salt Yankee bacon or ham,
three diminutive and excessively soapy potatoes, six
or seven ansemie green peas, and another 2oz. cube
of black bread. Either of these banquets will run
you into Is. 2d., beyond which no man dare attempt
to go in these hash-foundries under pain of being
reproved more in anger than in sorrow by the
superior creature who ministers to your wants with an
air of haughty and aristocratic detachment, and being
thereafter fined |£loo or something equally numer-
ous and costly for the gratification of the Food
Controller. When you tire of the constant round of
these fodder emporiums you may perhaps in a
moment of desperation drop into one of the better-
class shebangs, where the appetising odor of baked
meats and the strains of a debilitated string band
issue from its lordly and ornate portal what time
the “Piccadilly majah” and his lady friend are
effusively welcomed by the obsequious brass-bound
minion in the hallway. You find a seat and a menu,
and after backing your fancy four or five times with-
out success you leave it to the waiter, who brings you
a scrap of fried sole followed by a homoeopathic dose
of roast chicken, bacon and potatoes, a small sodden
slab of some weird concoction called pudding
Portuguese, a half-pint of claret, and a cup of cafe
noir. Liqueur and cigar? Not much. But you
weigh out 12s. exclusive of the waiter’s tip, and
drift out into the darkness and the rain feeling
hungrier and more dissatisfied than when you went
in. What with Government restrictions and the
horrifying rapacity of the profiteer, of a verity
London is no place for an animal with a healthy
, appetite.

AIR QAS SYSTEM.
In addition to the light being pure
and brilliant, it is far and away
cheaper than any other form of
artificial light. The closest analysis
gives the extraordinary result of
Quirk’s System, producing a more
efficient light than acetylene at
One=sixth of the Cost.
It is a steady light; no flickering so
distressful to the eyes; no erratic
pressure that causes the light to
jump. By a new and ingenious de-
vice which has been evolved by our
engineers, steady pressure is abso-
lutely assured. In a lighting system
this is unique, and places Quirk’s
Air Gas System on a higher plane
than any other.
No Complicated Mechanism.
This device simplifies an already
simple machine. There can be no
fear of the machine getting out of
order. That is one of the great
features of Quirk’s System. Once
installed it will run smoothly for
years, requiring practically no atten-
tion.
Fool Proof.
The great fear in the minds of many
who think of artificial light is the
danger of explosion, of combustion,
leakage and one hundred and one
other troubles of a home-made light,
but with Quirk’s Safety Air Gas
System all this is removed. It is
“fool proof.” There can be no ex-
plosion, no wastage of gas, no leak-
ing, no smell. None of those
disagreeable and dangerous elements
are even remote possibilities, let
alone probabilities.
The Summer Months
are dreaded by the housewife who
has to carry on the cooking, the
ironing, etc., under the old condi-
tions where artificial heat added to
the sun made home life a burden.
Quirk’s Air Gas System does its'
work without heating the atmo-
sphere. It does not add discomfort
to the kitchen. On the contrary, it
affords the housewife an opportunity
of doing her work under the most
agreeable conditions.
For Country Houses
no better system can be installed.
The maximum result is achieved
with a minimum of discomfort and
expense. Nothing to get out of
order, nothing to explode, no smell—
all clear, bright and healthy. It
can be adapted to the largest as well
as to the smallest house. If acety-
lene gas was previously installed the
existing fixtures can be utilised.
A Competent Staff
installs every plant and sees it is
working satisfactorily before hand-
ing it over. Nothing is left to
chance. If you have any doubts
write to the Quirk’s Lighting and
Engineering Ltd. for an Illustrated
Pamphlet, and get a thorough
acquaintanceship with what the Sys-
tem can do in the way of economy
and efficiency.

“Unalloyed” Dyes
The dyes used in Hose
of Luxite are “unalloyed”—not
loaded with heavy metallic com*
pounds to give the hose a glossy,
heavy appearance.
The soft, full-bodied shimmer of
Hose of Luxite is gained by the
use of rich, fine-stitched materials,
pure-dyed.
That is why its elegance and
beauty last through repeated wash*
ings.
The wide range of styles and
prices will suit every purse and
purpose.
Don’t accept substitutes, and
think you have “Luxite.”
Insist upon the genuine.

Our Artist Jewellers
have surpassed themselves this year for the Xmas trade
in brooches. They usually are up to date, but this Xmas
will reveal a range of exquisite new designs beyond any
previous year. The impossibility of importing has
probably been a spur to effort, necessity being the
mother of invention.
Anyhow, they “have grot there.”
WHAT about prices, though ?
Well, we make the brooches, and so are in a position
to know that they arc rare values.
Values greater than you can get in England.
Values larger than in previous times because we
bought the unset jewels at great—very great—reductions.

“John Quill”: For the most outlandish
form of greeting I nominate the following
one with which an enthusiastic Irishman
once saluted the late Archdeacon McGrath
at Trunkey (N.S.W.) : “Faith, an Oi’rn
glad t’ see ye, Father. And how the divil’ve
ye been poppin’ up through th’ nick ’f yer
shir-rt?”
“V.L.”: All was quiet in the dugout, when
suddenly Jim, the hard-doer of our little
party, rose quietly and moved stealthily
across our limited space. He grabbed his
rifle and stood tense in the position of ready
to fire and motioned to us to remain silent.
By signs he conveyed to us that he had seen
a head thrust up in the opening of our dug-
out. We sat for several minutes as if turned
to stone. I could not help remarking Jim’s
fine features, now set hard. I seemed to
read the hate and loathing behind his eyes as
the flickering light from the candle stuck in
the wall played on him and cast weird
shadows on the sandbags. He stood there
like some classic sculpture while waiting
for the head to reappear. Bang! With
a bound Jim was outside. There was a
sound of splashing, slipping feet and dis-
lodged timber, and in a minute Jim returned,
his face lit up with excitement. “Got the
blighter!” he cried, and slung the body in the
mud. It was a rat nearly the size of a cat
and clean shot through the head.
“11.”: My toil includes the consideration
of the letters of people who want to get out
of the army, or of people who want to get
someone else out of it; and they naturally in-
clude some comedy in a mass of tragedy.
An aunt, for instance, puts her plea for a
nephew this way :
He has, now, been four years in the line, and I
consider it is time that he was given some work to
do.
A lady in England expressed a spirit of
determination:—
lie should be entitled to leave, and if he can
receive it I should be glad to know, as if he does so
1 intend to marry him.
An epistle that is typical of many others
w r as written by a man who had only just
dropped into the battle-line. It had a
pathetic touch :
Since I reached the line I have, been thinking a
lot about my poor ojd mother, who was always very
good to me, and I think that mv proper place is
with her now that she is getting old.
The number of men who have suddenly
remembered their poor old mothers (and did
not, in many cases, leave any allotment)
shows that filial affection is not dead.
Everything about the Hun is vague except
Ins ferocity. When the Swiss diplomatic
agent in Washington, a man from a country
where 71 per cent, of the people use German
as their native language, received the Hun
peace proposals for transmission to Presi-
dent Wilson he put his great mind on the
matter of translation. Then he handed in
the original document and his own version.
But he added that the Hun had been at such
pains to use words with various meanings
that his reading was only one of the possi-
bles. It was literally accurate, blit there
were others equally accurate. The English
language is rather loose; to “suspend” a
man may mean hanging him or giving him
the temporary sack from his office, and
; execution” means anything from the render-
ing of a piece of music or the putting in of
a bailiff to violent death and burial inside
the gaol walls. But German, especially in
the. hands of a diplomatist, is so vague that
it is hard to say whether he proposes to
annex your country or to surrender at dis-
cretion.
“The Chained Anarchist” puts it this way:
Acting Prime-Treasurer Watt proposes that people
with a little means shall be compelled, under heavv
pressure of law, to subscribe to the War Loan. I
am willing—more than willing—-to do so if Acting
Prime-Shortage Watt will give me a fair deal.
There is a strong party in Parliament—so
strong that it may any day be the party in power—
which was represented at the Perth Labor Conference.
At that Conference it was proposed to repudiate the
public debt. The proposal wasn’t rejected. It was
treated as quite a feasible proposition and referred
to the Federal Labor caucus to decide upon. So far
as I know, the Federal members haven’t committed
themselves one way or the other. They are ambushed
or lying in wait. Perhaps they have postponed
repudiating the public debt till there is more debt to
repudiate. Now, seeing that the Acting Prime-
Scarcity of money intends to compel me,
to subscribe to his loan, will he introduce
a Bill setting forth that any idea of repudiation is
treason; that any member who proposes repudiation
shall automatically forfeit his seat there and then
and be disqualified for life; and that any member
who proposes to repeal the law disqualifying the repudi-
ation member shall himself be automatically disquali-
fied for life ? The payment of interest on loans may
stop for want of money in the Treasury, but stoppage
by Act of Parliament—stoppage out of intentional
and premeditated cussedness—should be penalised as
far as possible. If Mr. Watt, the Acting Prime-Impecu-
niosity, will introduce that measure then we will know,
by the number of votes against it, what are the odds
for or against the compulsory lender getting his at
present non-compulsory interest.
“C.C.” : Squatting, even without the assist-
ance of the war, and despite long droughts
and sparse herbage, pays well on the Westra-
lian. goldfields. Horan Bros., owning a
million acres of country that looks like plain
desert, have grown wealthy on -stock-raising,
and are the big butchers of the eastern and
northern fields. Members of the Boulder
Firewood Co,, which supplies wood for the
mines of the Golden Mile, hold a huge sec-
tion of territory behind Laverton almost as
profitable to them as their interest in the
fuel spec. Billy Hill, of Murrin, who at
one time kept the mining industry alive
thereabouts and took from one of hi's shows
gold valued at £140,000, saw so much in the
game of the pastoraiist that he absolutely
abandoned his auriferous properties and
went wholly into the stock business. A wide
system of wells, the windmills of which-dot
the landscape everywhere, has got over the
difficulty of a precarious rainfall (there was
one drought of five years’ duration) and the
mulga tree, hard and uninviting though it is,
provides a nutritious fodder in conjunction
with patches of salt-bush scattered through-
out the zone under pastoral lease. Pests
are confined to rabbits, which do not seem
to be resented, and the rapidly-vanishing
dingo. The only noxious weed is a poison-
plant, so scarce as to be hardly worth men-
tioning.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November 4,191 S.
Mr Dear Abini, —
“Jack’s Day,” with flags flying and the
joyous public eager to put its hand into its
pockets, was one of the brightest “days” Syd-
ney has known, and it has had an astonish-
ing variety of carnivals for war funds. The
lion, organisers, A. L. Blythe and Percy
Hunter, signal £lOO.OOO on the horizon. And
they haven’t reached for their telescopes yet.
In the morning, which came beautifully out
of a grey nest of clouds, naval men marched
through the streets with their typical air of
reserve. “Don’t mind us; we’re doing this
merely because we like it.” was their pal-
pable attitude. The crowd watching them
tramp along Pitt-street scarcely raised a
cheer. We take the navy as a matter of
course. Anyhow, making raucous noises and
semaphoring with a hat has gone out of
lashion.
Stall-holders in the busy marts of Moore-
street, Martin-place and historic Macquarie-
Place had been up with the milkman. In
Macquarie-place the scene eclipsed every pre-
vious turnout. The organisation was per-
fect. Here the shipping cos. had moored craft
■of varied tonnage, and deep in the holds of
these gaily-painted land-vessels were cargoes
that brought a rush of buyers.
The official lunch was in the Customs
House. Just outside the. Exchange was
H.M.S. Endeavour, a wonderful looking craft,
whence ancient seamen threw in tarry inter-
jections if the hon. auctioneer’s bellow failed
to raise the wind.
Bridge-street got: into business early, and
Birt and Co.’s white lighthouse flashed an
electric bulb over a stall that sorely tempted
Mrs. Housekeeper to turn pirate and sack it.
Burns, Pliilp and Co., flying the Nippon
lusen Ivaisha s shipping flag, commanded
one ot the most unique stalls in Sydney. Here
a really reliable Buddha could be picked up
tor a few shillings, and bronzes, butterfly and
bird designs on china, Japanese toys and
(piaint cuiios could be snapped up at give-
away prices. In Moore-street one of the
most original labels on a stall was that of
the 2nd D.A.C. Comforts Fund, which boldly
flew on an ensign, “Jacks are Trumps.” Mrs.
bhimuzu, in a silky kimono, beamed behind a
dazzling array of goods. Mrs. Floyd, one of
the private stall-holders remarkable for scoop-
lng in big returns on every Day, was near
o.y. Governor Davidson’s chaise was tem-
porarily blocked at one city corner in a
seething mass of humans, and the ever-read.y
ra flier fell upon the vice-regal person with
glad shouts of triumph. His Ex. a few
minutes later gave the news (already flying
round the town) that the British fleet'had
swept through the Dardanelles—a wonder-
ful titbit for Jack’s Day.
.Hie big loiiy that rumbles through every
street on such days is a pursuer from which
no man can escape. While the singers carol
Somewhere a Voice is Calling,” damsels
descend from the vehicle and search the citi-
zen for his last copper. Queen’s-square was
a naval dockyard, so to speak. On one side
was nioored the good old ship “Naval Com-
rade,” with its three masts and stern built
up high, and adjacent were guns, ropes, relics
of the Emden, an anchor or two, a smell of
tar, a torpedo, ammunition (shells, etc..
dating back a hundred years or more) and
a searchlight.
Mrs. Partridge made the anchor and rope
for the splendid and correctly modelled
and rigged Endeavour. She took three
days over the job. The anchor was of red
and white roses and the rope of marguerites.
Concerning the “dips,” here’s an extraor-
dinary coincidence. One man dipped three
times m different stalls and in each got a
Manly Ferry season-ticket. The doctor
needn’t order him a sea-trip for many a
month to come.
A very gallant Australian fell recently in
h ranee during the great pursuit of Fritz.
Ihis was Lieut. H. F. Morrison, M.C a
grandson of the late Dr. Morrison, Geelong
and a nephew of “Chinese” Morrison. The
young \ ictorian has been more or less at the
I'lont since the beginning. He w r as wounded
in the Landing, and in 1916 lie lost an eve
m France. I V‘ contrived to get over the
medical referee s objections and slipped back
to the Western battle-line. This time a
gunshot wound in the chest ended his work.
An Australian in N’York sends me this:
Mrs. Hutton Gibson, better known as Eva
Mylott, who xised to sing in Sydney, has a
small son. Marie Narelle (Mrs. Currie)
and Hilda Aiken, formerly of this side,
foregathered to croon over the new baby.
Katie Kilminster, now Mrs. Albert Lawless,
has three bonny youngsters to keep her Long
Island home alive with joyful noises. The
Scantleburys—mother and daughter Mignon
—are apparently settled in New York.
The Tait Repertoi-y eo. produced George
Bernard Shaw’s cutting play, “The Doctoi’’s
Dilemma,” on a warm summer afternoon
last week. Eardley Turner’s brilliant act-
ing, the clever half-tones of Cecil Bi-ooking
as the shabby general practitioner, and the
suave polish of Gerald Souper as the famous
physician Ridgeon were notable in the cast.
Geoi’ge Bryant’s fine character study of the
old Irish doctor, Patrick Cullen, Avas also
a pleasux’e.
Major Noel Bridges. A.1.F., a son of the
late Australian general, was wounded in the
great Allied move lately in France. He
was in civilian garb in Fiji when the war-
call came, and huri-iedly got into khaki. His
sudden and dramatic meeting with his father,
then on his way to Gallipoli, was one of the
picturesque incidents of the dark days.
Major 11. Coe, A.F.A., chose an Irish col-
leen (Miss M. Cuthbert, of Dublin) and was
recently wed in the British rainfall.
The Girls’ Evening Branch of the Ist Field
Artillery Comforts Depot are giving a party
to the returned men of the Ist Field Artil-
lery on the 14th November, at the Oxford
Hall, Sydney. It is to be an informal affair,
permission to wear uniform has been granted,
and the committee hope all those who have
not yet received their invitations will send
along their names to the Depot, in Bull’s
Chambei-s, Moore-street, Sydney.
A Sydneysider remarks from N’York:
“Saw Bert Levy this afternoon. He is
doing big things at the Hippodrome and
incidentally edits the Friar Club’s magazine.”
A Sydney man, Ninian Thomson, of King
Edward’s Horse, was married in the Fog a
few weeks ago. The chosen girl was Janet
Hannah, a Geelong (Vic.) damsel.
With banners flying and the family tramp-
ing alongside. Billjim made a triumphant
march through the city on Saturday morn-
ing. IJeavily disguised as “General Rein-
forcements,” he is more likely to be General
Useful, with orders to help clean up the
mess on various Fronts, after the departed
Hun. The womenfolk gave their most cheer-
ful |ood-byes to their strapping. lads that
they have been able to muster since the war
began. The dreadful feai’s of the past black
years have been dispelled.
At last week’s
meeting of Sydney
Zionists, members of
the ancient faith who
yearn for a national
home for Jews in
Palestine, Lieut.
Leonard Keys o r,
V.C., was handed a
gold cigarette-case,
from his co-i*eligion-
ists. A gift of about
£lOO in war bonds
was the ballast.
Rabbi Cohen made
the presentation.
The recently-returned
Anzac won his V.C.
in Gallipoli, but he
maintains silence as
to details. Born in
England, this brave soldier linked up with
the A.I.F. in the early days of the 1914
scramble for khaki. And he has been
mostly in the firing-line ever since. In the
October procession of returned men through
Sydney the olive-skinned young man, with
clean-shaven face, rode with Corporal Kenny,
V.C. On the Town Hall platform at the
subsequent welcome he was modestly taking
a hack seat, till the voice of authority
ordered him to the front. Lieut. Iveysor
went on to Melbourne some days ago, and left
no memoir of his stay in Sydney other
than this excellent photo by Judith Fletcher.
The farewell party given by ’Varsity
students before going off to see the remnants
of the enemy’s frightfulness was a big dance
in the Town Hall. The apparent end has
come so quickly, rushing to its terminus like
an overdue express, that, although most of
the Caps and Gowns enlisted in the days of
the enemy offensive, inevitable difficulties in
putting law and medicine aside delayed the
students’ departure till the full tide of Allied
victory. The municipal barn was trimmed
with glad rags and'illuminated herbage for
the send-off. William Cullen, C.J., as Chan-
cellor, was the guest of honoi*. With him
was his tall lady, surrounded by luminous
offshoots of the Bench and Bai\ J. R.
McClean, president of the Undergrads’ Asso-
ciation ; lion. secs. A. R. Cunningham and
J. G. Stephens ; and Captain Harper, D. 5.0.,
welcomed the official visitors.
At this year’s Arts and Crafts show our
leading craftswomen have lived up to their
reputations. In leather-work, cleverly tooled,
and showing designs of Australian flora
which reveal our old friend the gum-leaf and
blossom in attend-
ance Mrs. Spring
gives some charming
specimens of her
skill. During a trip
to France in 1912
the Sydney woman
noted in her round
of the studios the
exquisite effects
wrought by the
Demoiselle Germain,
one of Europe’s
finest artists in this
line, with inlaid gold
and silvex - . The best
examples are in the
Louvre. From time
to time Mrs. Spring
has followed this rich
scheme of decora-
tion with considerable success. The Trustees
of the National Gallery have again bought
leather-work done by this accomplished Aus-
tralian. Mrs. Henry Osborne, who met Presi-
dent Wilson’s daughter Margaret during her
trip to U.S. recently, sent her. by way of
showing what a high standard Australian
craftswomen can attain, a leather bag. This
was in a rich shade of brown, with gum-leaves
as the main theme. Mrs. Spring was the
lady whose artistic fingers fashioned the
work.
At. this year’s Arts and Crafts show no
individual returned sick and wounded sol-
dier’s work stands out as prominently as a
year ago. But the general standard is
excellent. This may be emphasised in the
basket-making and in the toy section. The
latter, under the Red Cross Industries—as
are other, samples of Billjim’s craft —are
vex’.y quaint. Mum Rabbit, in domestic
attire, is a delightful old lady, complete to
her white eyelashes. A large play-box, the
place where all good toys go to bed, with a
zoological design on the cover, was a strik-
ing piece of work, much coveted by kid-
dies. . The Basket Industry is gradually
becoming so important as a Red Cross side-
line for partially-disabled men that p'racti-
eY®r*v sample of basket is now made at
the Soldiers and Sailors’ Workshop, Law-
son House, Clarence-street.
Victorian contributions to the Sydney
Arts and Crafts’ show consist of quality
rather than quantity. This is noted in
leather work particularly. Soft and pliable
skins, stained in rich brown shades, make the
handbag from across the border a desirable
possession. The trustees of the National
Gallery have bought some charming little
drawings by a Melbourne woman. Miss
©powers, in . illustrations of child life,
depicts the spirit of immortal youth flying a
kite or communing with the moon. Of the
work shown by the Sydney society, Ada
.Newman’s painted China (two specimens
were purchased by the trustees), a greenish-
blue tinted leather-framed mirror by Mildred
T> r i, ed l also goin S t 0 the Gallery), Edith
Bell Brown’s pottery, Mrs. Sansom’s
repousst leather, and Nora Weston’s beaten
brass, deserve honorable mention. The show,
m the Education Department’s Gallery, goes
on till the end of this week.
A serene and rather plump girl in a white
Dock, Leila Doubleday, the much-travelled
Melbourne violinist, gave a concert in the
Gonservatorium on Saturday night. A
large audience appreciated the beautiful
tones ot the Guarnerius (an historic fiddle
made m 1741) and the clever, careful tech-
nxque of the Victorian. Few Australians
have had more brilliant training in Europe
than Leila Doubleday, or a more intimate
acquaintance with the unpleasant side of
Continental life in war-time. With all
this, she is essentially too calm herself to
rouse any audience to tempestuous acclama-
tion. Yet Sydney warmly applauded the
iTv? 3311 ? Y l0 ’ inis t, who certainly stands on the
threshold of a fine career. Elsv Treweek, in
wine-colored drapery, sang. Harold Elvins.
who accompanied,, was on the noisy side in
that respect. With the piano and platform
to himself he was more pleasing. Leila
will wield the bow again on Saturday even-
ing next.
Home again, with his hands happily un-
damaged, pianist Laurence Godfrey Smith
has been nearly overwhelmed by the con-
gratulations of his Sydney friends. He went
oft to London in 1915 to offer himself in any
capacity. The usually sedentary life of a
musician, which gives an irritable outlook,
got a grip oii this typical Australian.
All his spare time was given up to outdoor
exercise. And the hands that knock such
resounding chords out of a concert-grand can
hold with masterful strength the sinewed
up-country horse. Station-life in the holi-
days kept L. G. Smith fit. After an inter-
lude as interpreter in the Censor’s branch of
the War Office, lie got into a private’s uni-
form. and finally blossomed forth as a lieut.
in the artillery. Such compliments as came
his way from the enemy he caught on his
scalp. Another souvenir that he brought
home is a wife (Laurence was a bachelor
when the Sydney girls farewelled him).
The unveiling of honor-rolls on Saturday
kept Governor Davidson busy. In the
afternoon he sped to Haberfield School of
Arts to withdraw the drapery that camou-
flaged the names of over 400 brave Austra-
lians. In the evening, his Ex. bustled in
to the King’s Ilall. This was a similar
ceremony, but the honored were members of
St. John Ambulance.
The monkeys were the chief entertainers
at the Taronga Park fete for Jack’s Day.
Small black gnomes walking pertly about on
two feet, picking knots out of a tangled coil
of string, or vaulting lightly over sticks,
attracted the children particularly. Bands
playing popular airs failed to drag the youth-
ful audience away from a thrilling boxing-
match between two light-weight monkeys
with skins like black velvet. A third, with
goblin mischievousness, occasionally gave
one or other of the principals a hearty slap
in the face to maintain the balance of power.
The Zoo grounds are looking their best just
now. Mrs. Le Souef. Mrs. Spain and Mrs.
Ashford were amongst the stall-holders.
From Brisbane:—
The latest engagement is that of Capt. David
Parry-Okeden, son of the former Commissioner of
Police and a soldier who has been mentioned
several times in despatches, to Hilda Webster,
daughter of one of our big traders.
Lieut. Neville Fogarty was married during the
week to Elvie Whipped, daughter of the C. ib
Whipples, now living at Hamilton, but formerly of
St. George. The ’groom is a 15th Battalion man,
and comes from Jandowae. He left an arm in
Gallipoli, and has settled down as a stock and station
agent at Dalby. Miriam Whipped and Gwen Mar-
shall, the latter a Toowoomba girl, were the brides-
maids.
The Brisbane Operatic Players are staging “The
“Dairymaids” in good style all this week. Mrs. Arthur
Hunter is the producer. The frocking is very
smart, and the music is quite as good as in some
professional shows.
Florrie Robinson, a popular Toowoomba girl
and daughter of West Robinson, of the Darling
Downs Gazette, is to be married early in November
to Carl Palmer, a son of the late knight Arthur
Palmer.
Next Friday is “Flannel Flower Day,” the third
annual appeal on behalf of the War Nurses’ Fund.
Unlike the men, there is little or no provision
made for the nurse who comes back unfit for further
work. Several Bananaland nurses have received
decorations, two of them (one is Eileen King,
daughter of T. M. King, once Commissioner for
Railways) having been badly wounded while rescuing
patients from bombed hospitals. The fund is to
augment the cash held by the Nurses’ Association,
so that when these girls return they may rest
for awhile, without having to worry about the finan-
cial aspect.
Doris Cox. only lamb of Owen Cox, the
first knight produced in Australia after the
war started, returns home to Maoriland this
week after a seven months’ stay in Sydney.
The youngster helped run the plum-pudding
stall for Jack’s Day. Dad has been seriously
ill—overwork and influenza on top of “too
much meat.” He was commander-in-chief
of the supply of beeves and muttons in addi-
tion to his Red Ci’oss job.
The Women Painters’ Sketch Club will
display its wares in Vickery’s Chambers
(Pitt-street) froin November 5 till Satur-
day. The collection is composed chiefly of
small sketches and the pictorial calendar
that marks the flight of time.
Tours affectionately.

Melbourne. November 4. 1918.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The annual liorse-madness began on Satur-
day with the Derby, and the war news was
so good that patriots who had not watched a
gallop for years togged up and went out to
Flemington. The Hennessy dame walked in
royal purple and a skunk-fur cape. Mrs.
Cabena came out in grey tailorings with a
little red rose on the brim of her hat. The
French Missioners were the guests of honor.
The whole party attended with the exception
of the agricultural expert, who put in a
working day at Werribee. Mrs. Leslie Mac-
donald wore a turban of green and gold. Mrs.
Harold Hunt startled the lawn paraders with
flowing robes of sea-green silk. Mrs. Arnold
Westley loaded herself down with a handbag
like a cushion case. Mrs. Harvey Patterson
was impressive in tinted blue lace threaded
with gold and a hussar feather in her hat.
Commander Eardley Wilmot blazed with
gold braid. Mrs. Archie Currie wore the
latest embroidered vest with her tailorings.
The Alex. Gillespies had a lunch party under
the elms for Sydney visitors. Mrs. Merson
Cooper was under the flattest black hat on
record. Mrs. Anderson (Adelaide) had a
notable veil decorated with a band of gold.
Her tailorings were oyster color. Mrs. Willie
Moule was out, also Mrs. Rupert Atkinson.
There was a craze for flat Japanese umbrel-
las. One I saw looked like a slice of water-
melon. Mrs. Ord (Sydney) wore a velvet
coat over a black tulle dress. The weather
was cold and windy, and the wise women all
had furs. Mrs. Geoff. Syme wore a large
ermine cape over a white cloth dress. A
tall daughter in white accompanied her.
Mr. Godfrey (N.S.W.) promenaded in a
smart black-and-white frock. Captain
Maguire was there. His wife wore blue
with a Paisley lining to her race-coat. The
Bowes Kellys were numerous, and Mrs. Tol-
hurst had a tea-party. Mrs. Norton Grim-
wade entertained at lunch-time. Captain
Fred Grimwade was one of the party, and
fiancee Jo Foster smiled in dove-grey with a
blue chin-strap to her big feather hat.
The war news has heartened a num-
ber of hostesses to telephone invitations for
race-week dances. The Bowes Kellys, the
Curries and the Ross Sodens are among the
cheery ones who are going to open the ball-
room.
A picturesque figure at the Derby was
veteran Dr. Teague, of Frankston. > The
bearded old gentleman appeared in high' silk
hat, with regulation race-glasses slung over a
suit that represents the fashionable sporting
cut of a bygone day.
The French Missioners feel the cold
acutely in Melbourne, but they are com-
forted by the feeling that the climate had
no doubt made the Melbourne boys much
more able to face the rigors of winter in
France. The milder climates of Sydney
and Brisbane delighted General Pan.
Harry Whiting, back from the war, gave a
dinner on Friday night at Menzies’, with
Mrs. Leslie Stuart acting as hostess. The
hotel made enough space in the Indian room
for the diners to foxtrot afterwards.
Captain Gorman, returned with Flying
Corps honors, has brought his bride over to
Melbourne for Cup week.
Major Kerr-Pearse, once genthelp to the
G.-G., has been roped in by Governor Newde-
gate, of Tasmania, as secretary. Kerr-
Pearse was originally lent to Melbourne by
Tasmania.
Mrs. Grimwade, gave a lunch-party at the
Quamby for son Fred (back from the Front)
and his girl, Jo Foster, who was a decora-
tive figure in a grey chiffon frock and a hat
with blue velvet ribbons. The hostess wore
a tile with an excited feather in front. The
guests were the most expensive procurable,
and the lunch lasted for ever so long. It
was a great inning.
The young English bride of Captain
Symonds, V.C., has bought a cookery-book,
some new brooms and dusters, and is look-
ing for a hand-painted flat in St. Kilda.
Dr. Denis, of Yarrawonga, one of the
leaders of the French colony in Victoria, has
been arm-in-arm with General Pau in most
of his excursions. They are old comrades
of 1870. The doctor looks like an illustra-
tion in an old French novel; and his courtly
manners are a joy to our sex. His linen is
the well-known “immaculate” brand, retailed
by novelists of all countries.
Mrs. Gordon Knox (we knew her as
Kathleen Maepherson) knows the Quaran-
tine Station in Sydney by now. She was
hurrying home to her invalided soldier when
the health-officer stopped the ship she was
on. Mrs. Knox has been war-working in
England. She was a moneyed young heiress-
bride when hubby left for the war.
The other afternoon the Harry Paynes’
girl Ella hostessed an At Home for spinsters
only, two youthful matrons being the excep-
tions to the rule. It was a very dressy
affair.
The’Hubert Sargoods had a gorgeous revel
on Thursday evening to celebrate daughter
Toma’s coming of age. There was quite a
pre-war brilliancy about it.
Mrs. E. Jowett hostessed a feminine tea-
party on Friday afternoon, to farewell sister
Mrs. John Cooke, who, with her husband,
is returning home to Bananaland. The next re-
joicing will be to welcome home daughter
Marjorie Fairbairn, her soldier husband and
the two babies.
Western District squatter Alan Currie,
who has been wearing a British uniform for
four years, is now a major with two wound-
stripes and a Military Cross. Major Alan,
who tied up with the younger Albert Miller
daughter, was chairman of the V.A.T.C. be-
fore he became a soldier, and his name still
decorates the V.R.C. committee list.
J. C. Manifold, of
Camperdown, who
died and was buried
at sea last week,
was one of the rich-
est of the rich Mani-
folds, and was re-
turning from his
second trip abroad
on war-work. This
generous patriot not
only assisted the
work of repatriation
by great gifts, but
he worked hard per-
sonally for the sol-
diers’ welfare. His
pre-war record as a
landowner and em-
ployer shows that he
was a good Aus-
tralian who know how to use his wealth.
He was only 51 at the end. Grandfather
Manifold arid his brother wandered about
the Victorian bush until they discovered
Camperdown. They mapped out large areas
and took it up. Manifolds have occupied
the same rich territory ever since.
The Herbert Powers have bidden their
friends to a Sunday-afternoon tea-drinking to
welcome son Reggie back from the Front.
Captain Reggie, who has been nursing a
smashed leg, will have only a brief holiday
before hurrying back to a British regiment.
Wife Phyllis is in England under the mater-
nal Grey-Egerton roof.
The John Grices’ second girl, Hilda, and a
Frank Grey-Smith daughter are off to spend
Christmas in Honolulu.
Architect Klingender and his wife have
been wavering between relief and anxiety
since an official cable advised them that their
only son Keith had qualified for a second
wound-stripe by delaying some shrapnel with
his hand. Last time he interfered with the
flying steel it was with his leg.
The Alliance Franqaise adherents crowded
in to hear Dr. Siegfried talk to them on
Friday night in the Independent Hall. The
Henuessy dame, as president, made an intro-
ductory speech in French.
Lieut. Eric Roberts, who did his bit in
Palestine with the A.F.C., is now T adjutant
to the Commonwealth School of Aeronautics
at Portsea. After being invalided home he
was for a time orderly-officer to Brig.-
General Williams ; but he finds his present
down-tlie-bay billet better for his nerves and
nearer his own idea of effective war-service.
Captain J. M. Mathew, whose dad is Pres-
byterian chaplain- at Pentridge' Stockade, and
has for many years shepherded the Scotch
flock at Coburg, has repatriated himself by
taking a job with the Electrolytic Zinc Co.
Before doing his bit on Gallipoli, Mathew
had had a long experience in metallurgy in
various parts of Australia.
I would say that General Pan’s most ex-
hilarating day here was in the railway excur-
sion to the big timber and saw-mills in
Powell town Forest, which is fairly close to
the city, yet as deep in bushland as one could
wish. There are hillsides with battalions of
towmring eucalypts. The General said the
locality resembled the Vosges, where he
fought in 1870. State Governor Stanley
was with the party. Nothing delighted Pau
more than school children at the railway
stations singing the Marseillaise and waving
little tricolor flags. The grand old soldier
kissed a number of tiny girls, with “Aha,
ma petite !” —something for Gladys Muriel to
recollect throughout life. Arrived at last in
the bush the General thoughtfully watched
the felling of a . giant tree. 200 feet high.
Down it came- —with a crash like Germany,
the Frenchman might have thought.
The committee of the Purple Cross Ser-
vice of Victoria faced members at last week’s
annual meeting with a credit balance of
£1533, while the expenditure for the year
was nearly £l7OO. Very little of this went
on anything but actual horse necessities.
Most of the spending was left to the experts
at or near tne various battle-fronts, the bulk
of the money being sent abroad through the
Defence Department for use as needed; and
the management kept local expenses down to
a business-like level—as, for instance, when
having a copy of its report bound for the
King, who had to be satisfied with a seven-
and-sixpenny cover. Dr. Weigall, chairman
of the association, explained to the meeting
that the Repatriation Department, which
recently put the lid on the concern’s cash-
raising activities by prohibiting further ap-
peals, had done so “without consulting the
committee or allowing any explanation from
any of the veterinary authorities.” Two-
thirds of the normal P.C.S. revenue has come
from such appeals, so the edict has given the
society a nasty jolt. However, though
officialdom has closed the door, it can’t close
the cheque-books of sympathisers—and there
are quite a number of them.
Mrs. Willie Moule and Mrs. Rupert Atkin-
son are arranging a big bridge party at
Brighton, to provide comforts for the Light
Horse. The rally will be at the Atkinson
house.
St. Vincent's Hospital has to cope with
the soaring prices of food and drugs. While
an overdraft on maintenance of £5OOO worries
the Mother Rectress, friends and sympa-
thisers are rallying round to ease the bur-
den. A booklet of miniature pictures, full
of vivid scenes of Australian bush life, is
now on sale for the good cause. Leading
artists have eontriouted. On December 14
30 pictures will be in the prize-list.
Children’s Day on Friday was a cheerful
outing. There is something very appealing
about a gang of infantile bushrangers that
is lacking when the familiar flapper is
rattling the box. Children had flowers for
sale as buttonholes in big be-ribboned baskets,
and more flowers in huge bouquets that
nearly hid the smiling sellers. It was mostly
lilac and roses and lily-of-the-valley that
they trafficked in. An Anzae father was
giving a big children’s lunch-party upstairs
in a Collins-street cafe when a band below
Struck up the Anthem. The soldier
host flung up the window, made a stir-
ring speech and called for cheers for the
glorious war news, for the King, for our men
still fighting, and for the prisoners of war
soon to be freed. Before he finished he had
the whole street shouting with him. I
believe we are an emotional people, after all.
The Melbourne Music Club gathers again
to-night at the Galleries. Stanley Adams
has the programme in hand and will person-
ally deal with Bach on the piano. Con-
stance Buchan is due, with a group of new
songs by Fritz Hart.
Rebottaro, the gay Italian singer, has been
kicked by a horse and is in hospital planning
a grand operatic revenge. He says he will
sing to that horse again if he perishes in the
attempt.
The late Judge
Gaunt’s son. Captain
Guy Gaunt, R.N.,
recently made
a rear-admiral, holds
the same rank as his
brother Ernest. As
midshipmen, the pair
saw some merry
times on the Aus-
tralian coast, and
are well remembered
at many ports.
Portland contempo-
raries of the brothers
recall their visit to
Victoria’s first town-
ship at the time of
the Henty jubilee.
That was in 1884,
when a willing
bunch from the visiting naval squadron
helped the local ’longshoremen to paint the
old town the right color for the occasion.
However, the Gaunts never allowed pleasure
to interfere with seamanship, a fact to which
the record of the sailor brothers plainly
testifies.
A packet of “soap-paper” is one of the
little luxuries which nowadays some sol-
diers’ relatives slip into their Billjims’ par-
cels. The article is simply unsized paper,
impregnated with soap and very light and
handy. Billjim moistens a small strip of it
and is able at once to work up a nice scented
lather, which reminds him of clean, enam-
elled bathrooms and bygone, pleasant times
with a big towel. Quite a neat idea —but at
present the soap-papers are foreign-made and
have to be carried across an ocean or two
before they are available for putting into
Billjim’s parcel. Perhaps some Australian
factory-management might find an extra job
for some returned Aussies by starting to
extend the convenience locally?
From Miss Adelaide
The Red Cross Tea-room Girls’ “Hello, Egypt”
revue was staged for the third time on Monday night.
It happened at the Tivoli, and the proceeds were ear-
marked for the Navy League Widows and Orphans'
Fund. On Thursday evening a concert in the Queen's
Hall brought in more money for the same fund,
while a concert by Mrs. Harold Sexton’s pupils
divided its profits between Red Cross and Navy
League funds.
Neville Colley has won his captaincy and a “men-
tion” since rejoining his unit, after a brief furlough
here, lie has lately been transferred to the Indian
cavalry.
Bessie Davidson has sold one of her pictures to
the French Government for the Luxembourg Gallery.
She is a daughter of George Davidson, who was for
years secretary of the Wallaroo and Moonta Mining
and Smelting Co., and left with Rose McPherson to
study art in Europe some time before war broke out.
Capt. MacCullum, who has put in three years as
a Comforts Fund Commissioner in France, spent
last week interviewing the local organisation and its
sub-committees, and telling the geiferal public what
an immense need there is for the supplemental foods
and clothing which the Comforts Fund supplies. His
visit should help the local Trench Comforts appeal,
which is booked for the first two weeks of this month.
The Anzac Hospitality committee tried the experi-
ment of substituting a “silent appeal” for the usual
clamorous button day, and on Thursday groups of
women waited quietly in the streets for cash. The
takings are well up to the usual button-day average.
Capt. J. L. Sandford is here on furlough, after
three years with the R.F.A. Lieut. Sadlier, V.C.,
is staying with his people at Dulwich, and dodging
public entertainments as much as possible.
Sergeant C. A. Black, a one-time secretary of the
Public Service Association and President of the South
Aus. branch of the A.N.A., has been killed in action.
Capt. C. Hein, of the North Laneashires, has added
a bar to ins Military Cross. He is a son of
R. H. Ilein, who was once with John Darling and
Sons here and is now manager of the London branch
of the firm, as well as chairman of the Australian
Wheat Committee in London.
Mat McNally, the genial water-colorist, is
wearing an air of suppressed importance,
having just been appointed by the Federal
Government art-adviser for Victoria to the
Historical Memorials Committee, in place of
the late Hugh Paterson.
Jimmy Macdonald, painter and scribe, is
back in Melbourne, after more than three
years at the Front. He enlisted in the early
days of the war and baked in Egypt with
MeOubbin and other congenial mates.
After a round of farewells from her numer-
ous friends, journalist Freda Sternberg
flitted Sydney wards last week en route for
TJ.S.A. She lately made a flying tour oi
Wilsonland with Melba ; this time she is on
her own and expects to make a long stay.
In “Hullo, Everybody!” the refrain of one
of Minnie Love’s songs is whistled by a girl
in the orchestra well. Evidently Hugh Ward
and Charlie Wenraan do not share the late
J.C.W.’s superstition that whistling inside
a theatre is unlucky. The old chief refused
to allow it in any circumstances.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

WHISKY
Truly good Whisky must
possess these three essentials-
CHARACTER—REPUT ATION—
MATURITY.
Character. —Good whisky possesses character
as men possess personality. It is that subtle
charm of flavour—crispness without harshness,
softness without weakness—so indicative of
perfect purity and divine distillation that has
moulded the character of Dewar's and earnt
the appreciation of mankind.
Reputation. —Man never went far without a
good reputation, and neither does whisky. The
reputation of Dewar's has for its foundation long
years of irresistible quality, constant and peerless,
bringing the glorious gifts of splendid health to
the body and rare contentment to the mind.
Maturity. —Age ever did command respect. In
Dewar's to-day is to be found all the experience
of many generations in the arts of blending and
. distillation, which has for its end the production
of a whisky—always ripely matured —worthy-
of its universal designation as
THE SUPREME SPIRIT.


The ravages of war and revolution may
change the history of continents, but the
merit of King George IV.. the whisky of the
wise, like the law of the Medes and Persians,
is unalterable. — Advt.

The Melbourne Cup of T 8 will be recorded
in the annals of Israel as having brought home many
sides of bacon. The ring must have had a copious
win. If, a month ago, the average racing man had
been asked to name half a dozen on the list having no
hope he wouldn’t have met with much opposition
if he put Nightwatch among the number. Here was
a nag which, up to that point, had absolutely no
recommendation as a Cup horse. His record up to
then was painful—not a win in three seasons. And
his win from a second-rate field in the mile and a
furlong 1010 Welter at Caulfield a couple of weeks
before the Cup was nothing to make a song
about. The second to Court Jester in the
Hotham Handicap looked better. The only
point about him was his parentage—St. Alwyne
—Wakeful. If anything was ever bred to
stay a horse with that derivation was. Another
and quite subsidiary point was that lie happened
to be in the same stable as King Offa, and was
apparently being kept in as a second string or some-
thing. After King Offa went under a cloud Night-
watch came into the betting at long prices—-and then
was only nibbled at. So, again, practically all the
tipsters were stumped. Most of them put
Nightwatch in the discard, and that good horse
Ivennaquhair and Gadabout were given comparatively
small chances at the last. Ivennaquhair ran like the
game horse he always has been. He was giving the
winner 21st., a weight which tells heavily at the
end of two miles, when the lighter-burdened animal
takes kindly to the distance. Gadabout’s good show-
ing was not a surprise to his connections. They
backed him confidently in the Metropolitan, and
reckoned it was bad luck they didn’t win. After
all, the rumors of a month or two ago about Brad-
field’s stableful of champions was not altogether irre-
sponsible. To turn out the winners of the two
Cups and the Melbourne Stakes is an achievement
that counts even among big things.
* * * *
Though Desert Gold had in previous races
been twice beaten, and the imported Magpie was
twice a winner, the mare was at 6 to 4 and the
other at 5 to 2 for the Melbourne Stakes, with
Wolaroi at 6’s and Cetigne at B’s. Bracken was on
the Maorilander and she looked as well as ever —a
very remarkable circumstance in view of the amount
of racing and travelling she has done. Bullock, was
aboard Magpie. The race was a repetition of previous
performances in which Desert Gold had figured at
Rand wick and Flemington. She quickly ran to the
front and was soon two lengths out. Wolaroi,
Oet.igne and Magpie were close up at the turn.
Wolaroi tried to get up and found it too fast, and
at the furlong post Desert Gold looked an almost
certain winner. Then Magpie came on and, closing-
on her at the half-distance, worried her out of the
stake by a neck, Wolaroi a length and a half back.
It was a great struggle, and, as in every other race
the mare has been headed in Australia, the winner
had to put up record time to do it. Magpie ran
the mile and a quarter in “4?},” the best for the
race, and the smartest registered for the distance
at Flemington. He must have done the last couple
of furlongs at phenomenal speech Owner Lowry
and trainer Davis were very confident that the mare
would win, but no more so than Bradfleld was about
Magpie.
From a Derby point of view the field at Fleming-
ton was no better than that at Randwick. Perhaps
it was not quite so good. Before the race most of
the argument seemed to turn on what Finmark was
going to win by. Subsequently it consisted of
heated observations about what he would have
done if he had done something else and the others
had performed in an entirely different manner. It
was ail speculation.- Finmark might have won if the
race had been run differently, but there is no get-
ting away from the fact that the colt which did win
had stronger recommendations as a probable winner
in any circumstances than had the Maorilander.
Eusebius had won the Mefnsie Stakes and the
Caulfield Guineas, and there was quite a lot of merit
about his third in the Caulfield Cup. The race was
more or less farcical. The field dawdled along behind
Democracy to the six furlongs, where Outlook was
second, Eusebius next and Finmark fourth. At this
stage Lewis appeared to reckon the time was ripe
to hurry up, and Outlook sprinted for the post-
Eusebius and Finmark followed him into the straight,
and on the iourney home it was Eusebius who ran
the leader down. Catching him in the last 50 yards,
the Eudorus colt, ridden right out, finished like a
good horse and won by a head, Finmark, a length off,
third. It was the slowest Derby for 18 years—
“47:}.” Malster took }sec. longer, and to get the
record of a more leisurely event it is necessary to
go back to ’B5, when Nordenfeldt registered “48:}.”
McLachlan has been severely criticised for his
handling of Finmark. It is alleged that if he had
clapped on the pace the colt must have won. This
is mere guesswork. Anyhow, McLachlan’s answer is
that he rode to hard-and-fast orders—that he w-as
told to in no circumstances whatever to go nearer
the front than third or fourth until reaching the
straight. Further, that in reply to his objection
that, if the race was slowly run, Outlook might be
specially favored bv the final sprint, he was told
that this made no difference—he was to keep behind.
On the Rosehill running there is no reason to sup-
pose that Finmark was any worse served by the
dawdle than he would have been if a solid pace
had been set; nor on the Caulfield Cup result is there
any reason to imagine that Eusebius was specially
favored as against Finmark by the crawl to half-
way. If those were the orders McLachlan got, and
there seems no doubt about it—well, judgment about
a race is often as bad as about a horse. * As Fin-
mark’s stable-mate, Killowen, was scratched, it looks
as if the owner was not as anxious for a solid pace
to start with as a lot of people subsequently thought
he should have been.
* * * *
Finmark will be remembered a long time
as the most prominent false alarm Derby <olt raced
in the Commonwealth for many years. After Rose-
hill this writer took the opportunity of announcing
that when Finmark furnished reasonable justifies-;
tion to be considered a Derby animal it would be
soon enough to consider him up to that standard, and
not before. This justification was never forthcoming.
All that was produced were rumors and tips and
allegations about other nags. Now the multitudinous
tipster is busy making excuses for himself by cover-
ing them up with excuses for the colt. The usual
yarn seems to be that “the pace was too slow for
him” at Flemington. This follows upon the other
yarn that the pace was too fast at Randwick. There
seems a natural sort of sequence about them, any-
way. At Rosehill Finmark was made a red-hot
favorite, and after making the pace got smothered
by Woorawa. Then the boosters, who had been
responsible for the public losing its money, declared
that if he had been ridden behind he would have hit
the front at the right time. He was ridden behind
in the A.J.C. event, and didn’t do it. His second to
Gloaming was grossly misrepresented. He simply
hadn’t a 1000 to I chance with the winner. _ The
best that could be said was that, like Bronzetti in the
previous year, he struggled through a played-out
crowd up the straight. Then, apparently because of
the field for Flemington being conspicuously weak
and because a couple of demented punters who
operate with large wads rushed him up in the market,
the colt’s boosters boosted some more. On perform-
ance, on appearance and even upon ancestry there
were sound reasons for scepticism about Finmark.
This writer contracted the complaint in a virulent
form on the first view—and didn’t part company
with his dollars.

Frank Bullock, King Offa’s jockey, came
from Wild Duck Creek, near Ileathcote (Vic.), a
place where they talk horse 24 hours a day. His
. father, a roughrider, joined the police, and was
stationed in Melbourne. Frank became a boy jockey
and won a race Or two in Melbourne, but more round
the North-eastern district. He was sent to England
with J. E. Brewer’s mare Kate Carew, and joined
Brewer’s stables at Newmarket. He was engaged
to ride there for Henning, a Westralian mining
investor, who wanted to spill some of his gold on
the turf. After many tries on horses not quite good
enough, competing with jocks like Maher, Madden,
Kemptdn," Cannon, Halsey and Lane, Bullock won
the Dewhurst Plate on Rouge Croix, afterwards sent
to Australia. He won other good things, including
the Manchester Cup, on Airship, an English Biplane.
AVhen he returned to Australia lie won the Melbourne
Cup on Blue Spec. Before that he was six years
riding in Germany, and headed the jockeys’ list in
five years.

The scheme for transferring the dates on
which allcg’ed “races” are held at Moorefield (Syd-
ney) to the A.J.C. appears to have been put into the
ice-chest for a time. Meanwhile the explanation,
apparently official, made by some of the newspapers
about the attitude of Chief Secretary George Fuller
towards this matter are not particularly creditable.
It is alleged that in Fuller’s opinion the pony-course
proprietors “deserve consideration,” and that as.
these institutions have to suspend their dollar-snaring
episodes when there are races at Randwick, a change
of the menu from Moorefield requires careful ponder-
ing over. The pull exercisable over Governments by
pony and other proprietary outfits in Australia has
always been pretty solid. This page invites Fuller
to explain exactly why he feels so benevolent
towards the pony crowd, and what excuse he has to
offer for the existence of proprietary racecourses
about Sydney.

A Perth punteress, who knew her business,
put up a great performance at the Goodwood (S.A.)
meeting (seven events), but she has a grievance.
She invested 2s. 6d. on a horse in the first race,
stating that the lot should go on a specified horse in
the next event, continuing the pyramid until the
last race. The seven selections all transpired. Un-
fortunately for the lady Ike had a £25 limit. That
was what she won. Had the same investments been
made through the totalisator the final collection
would have been £2lOO.
McCann, Trade Commissioner for South
Aus. in London, stated recently that no Australian has
done more for the Australian boys who are wounded
in hospitals at Epsom than Richard Wootton. His
boys Frank and Stanley have been in the thick of it
in Mesopotamia. The former rode the winner of the
Bagdad National Steeplechase. Richard Wootton,
junior, is now nine years of age and gives every
indication of having inherited the riding ability so
apparent in his older brothers. The Misses Sheila
and Brenda Wootton also ride admirably.

“Mulruana”: Hang the first prize on this.
At a recent Melbourne race-meeting the committee
issued an order relative to free admittance of re-
turned soldiers. The decree read: “Only those
soldiers who have lost a limb (or limbs) shall be
nod passengers at the gate.” Two whole Billjims on
arrival at the course, decided to make an offensive
against the regulation. From the cab paddock they
reappeared witli but a single arm apiece. They were
in time for the first.

The “sweating” of boys at schools’ ath-
letic meetings toucSed the limit at a Waverley
(Sydney) Fellowship Club meeting recently. Among
the seniors J. Dawson kept going long enough to win
the 100yds., 440yds., 880yds., high jump, broad
jump and hurdles championships; and among the
juniors E. Dait endured long enough to grab the
220yds,, 440yds., 880yds., hurdles and broad-jump
championship, 100yds. handicap, and put a leg into
the three-legged events. How much longer will
headmasters or sportsmasters allow youths to wear
themselves out in this fashion? For years the
practice has called loudly for more careful treatment.

Another old-timer came to light again in
Sydney premiership cricket on Saturday, when A. J.
Hopkins (Middle Harbor) ended Western Suburbs’
innings hurriedly by gathering a couple for 6.
“Hoppy” toured with the Australian Xl’s of ’O2, ’O5
and ’O9, and has played for N. S. Wales against Vic-
toria and South Australia in Sheffield Shield matches.
In the ’O2 tour to England his best biff was 105
not out against Gloucester, and with Clem Hill
(123) and M. A. Noble (100) also making three-
figure knocks in the innings Australia had the big-
gest win on the trip—an innings and 222 runs.
In the ’O5 jaunt Hopkins's 154 against Northampton-
shire was also the biggest knock towards the Aus-
tralians’ victory by an innings and 330 runs. Hop-
kins’s hardest hit in first-class cricket was 218
against S. Australia in 1909. On bad wickets Hop-
kins was a terror to batsmen. His seven wickets.
1 for 10 against Cambridge University in ’O2 (which
included the hat-trick) and the Sydney premiership
averages of 1899-1900 with 40 wickets, averaging
12.45, are items in cricket history.

“O.B.” ; Bowled by the Turk in Palestine,
Gordon C. White, one of the finest all-round cricketers
S’Africa has produced. Unfortunately White couldn’t
come to Australia with Sherwell’s 1911 team, but
he twice visited England and did well, especially
with the ball. With the bat he averaged 50 in
1904, and 22 in 1907, while in the latter year he
took 137 wickets for 11.79 apiece. International
cricketers, by the way, have had father a good innings
in their long game with the Hun. Of all those who
have gone in on the very nasty wicket I can think of
only four who are out for good—Gordon White,
Albert Cotter, Charles Blythe and If. L. Hutchings.
As luck would have it, they were all top-notchers.
White, after Faulkner, was South Africa’s best all-
rounder. Cotter we all knew as a pocket Her-
cules who hurled a ball down a pitch faster
than anyone since Jones, and probably as fast as any
trundler the world has yet seen. He was also a
wonderful slogger. I once saw him hit up a score
of 86 in Melbourne. It drew more cheers from the
crowd in half an hour than the average player re-
ceives in a lifetime. Blythe was for years the main-
stay of Kent, and easily the best slow bowler in
England—though, curiously enough, a failure in Test
matches. He was far too nervy. Charles was once
found crying in the pavilion because he had missed
a catch and been jeered at bv some idiots in the
crowd. Hutchings was a brilliant forcing batsman
(as many Australian bowlers have cause to remem-
ber) and, in the opinion of many, the greatest of
all outfields, not excluding Ransford. Incidentally,
he was among the best-looking fellows who ever wore
flannel, and the news of his death doubtless drew
many a sigh from damsels who had watched their
curly-headed hero sprinting around the rails.

“Chey”: Army-training has queer effects
on certain athletes; but who could imagine Jack
Donaldson, erstwhile world’s champion sprinter, going
in for long-distance racing? News from back of the
Front announced that the winner of a seven kilometres
race at Regimental Sports was Sergeant J. Don-
aldson. lie did the distance (a little over 44 miles)
in 23 minutes —good running this, even for’ such a
wonderful sprinter as the Victorian streak. That
licking by little Billy Applegartli, the Britislli
amateur champion who turned pro in order to meet
Donaldson, in two straight sprints, 130yds. and
220yds., just after trouble started in Europe, was a
big blow to Donaldson.
‘ Country Ped”: Swivel-gunning, accord-
ing to “Bill R.” (B. 17/10/’18) is not permitted in
Australia. Nevertheless it is carried on. Only a
few weeks back, coming up by train from Bendigo
to Swan Hill, I saw one of those murderous weapons
in use on Lake Boga, which was swarming with teal,
black duck and other wild-fowl. As the train passed
by we could see the gunner gently sculling his boat
and rounding up a mob of ducks ready for a shot.
What he was going to do with the slaughtered birds
puzzled me, as the sale of wild duck is not permitted
in Victoria ; but then, if a man can use a swivel-gun
in broad daylight without getting roped in by the
police, I dare say he can dispose of the dead game
just as easily. The police are always active at the
opening of the season, when they go chasing around
the country to see that no one shoots more than
the regulation 15. When that duty has been done
Hop goes home and the duck gets what’s coming to
him.
* * * »
“Auss”: Re Bill Bowyaug’s remarks (B.
10/10/’18) that range-shooters do not make good
snipers on service. The scenery in each case was
just south of the Somme, when Fritz was easing off
for a breather after his March push. Australia’s
anti-kulturists had arrived in position during the
night, unknown to the other party, who at that
stage imagined he owned the world. When day-
light came the Hun was noticed wandering carelessly
round the landscape. I mentioned the matter to
Geo. Williams, a well-known Melbourne gumnan
and King’s Prize collector, who promised to remedy
the trouble. He secured 14 authenticated hits by
lunch-time. The startling decrease in the family
caused the neighborhood to be labelled dangerous
by the enemy, thus decreasing the number of targets.
As all these shots were at moving men, varying
from 400 to 700 yards away, with a misty rain
falling, 1 consider the matter should have been
mentioned in Haig’s communique, but it got
crowded out somehow. Now let me introduce the
unluckiest Prussian yet born. Just after stand-
down on the following morning I was inspecting the
country in front through glasses, paying special
attention to a small brick shrine, on a crossroads
over 1000 yards away. Feeling sportive, I suggested
to the day sentry beside me, whom I could guarantee
to hit a continent at 100 yards, that he put his
sights up to 1100 and try his luck on a window, the
idea being to mix some broken glass with the sausage.
Noting the choppy wind blowing, and the man’s
mud-coated rifle, i prepared to spot his shot any-
where in front. A second before the report of
his rifle, a Fritz stepped out of the door. At
about the fifth pace along the load he crumpled
up in a heap. I had to forego my rum ration to
steady the sentry’s nerve.
* * * *
“Pick”: “Nimrod” (B. 2G/9/’18) spills
ridicule over my assertion that a man with a rifle
once, at 100 yards, split a pipe-bowl, and, later, at
600 yards, slew a cockatoo. Does “Nimrod” know
that at every rabbit-freezing works in N. S. Wales
rabbits shot with the rifle are supplied ? The pro-
prietors will only take those shot through the head,
and the hunters, with due regard to this specification,
bag them in dozens from any distance up to 200
yards. Almost any pipe-bowl would cover the vital
portions of a rabbit’s brain box. “Nimrod’s” scien-
tific theorising regarding the grouping of shots from
a fixed rifle may be correct, but his talk about
authentic records is rot. Every rifleman understands
the drift of the rifle he is accustomed to, and many
have made possibles on the 6in. bull up to 400 yards,
though the grouping of a fixed rifle’s bullets at that
distance would spread over Bin. Also, in the egg-pool
matches at Randwick, the winners always were men
who at 500 yards made one or ■ more hits on the
invisible 2in. bull centre. Why, then, find fault with
my man who killed a cockatoo at 600?

He led the Sunday-school ; with zest
He bossed the Band of Hope, withstood
All kinds of evil, and was blessed
With such high gifts he quite possessed
The Anti-Gambling Brotherhood.
Alas! he mixed by hapless chance
These bank accounts up with his own,
By reason of which high finance
The Anti-Gamblers’ funds had flown,
The Band of Hope was bankrupt quite,
The church had scarcely got a bean.
Then Brother Ham went deathly white,
And conscience plagued him day and night.
Despair had n his spleen.
Then came the Devil to his ear,
And whispered there a horse’s name.
’“Back Kipper!” Cowering in fear
The elder bade Old Nick “For shame 1
Begone, vile tempter!” That day Nick
The name repeated fifty times.
Then Brother Ham, beset and sick,
Toole all the cash and did the trick—
He added gambling to his crimes 1
He backed The Kipper right and left.
The Devil lisped his artful strain.
“Back Kipper!” and each fund was reft
Our elder, desperate for gain,
In doubles coupled him with Rats,
And got a leg in. On these grounds
Ham bought The Kipper's chance in Tatt.’s.
The Cup was run. Up went the hats,
And Ham cleared twenty thousand pounds!
Ham’s rich. He runs our Bethel still,
The Band of Hope controls with ease,
And supervises books and till
For three Uplift Societies.
He backs no horse, and will avow
His hatred of the gambler’s lust;
But waits for Satan’s whisper now,
For Satan is, as well 1 trow,
The only tipster he will trust!
VICTORIA.

For the World again will never trust;
And it. will he many, and many a year,
Before we see them again come out and burst.
May we see them in pain for the people they’ve slain,
And the devill haunt them day and night;
To think of others they have given pain,
For whatever they, saw in sight.

They must expect to feel the conqueror’s heel;
And never we’ll listen to their say,
Until! down on their knees to appeal.

“Schoolmarm”: Don’t tell me the N. S.
Wales Government doesn’t practise economy !
I had a week’s holiday recently, and
spent it with a relative who became seri-
ously ill, and I had to take her to a Sydney
hospital. I applied for leave for one day,
as it was impossible to get back to my
duties before the afternoon of the first day
of school opening. Three weeks later I re-
ceived notice that leave had been granted,
without payment. It works out at about
2s. 3d. for the day, and the department lost
3d. on stamps, to say nothing of the
stationery.
The Westralian shipbuilding industry
closed its doors before they were fairly open.
It built no ships. The co. offered the
Federal Government’s terms — i.e., a mini-
mum wage to be paid even if it wasn’t earned
according to piecework rates, and anybody
who earned more than the minimum to be
paid more. This wasn’t real piecework, which
means giving nothing for nothing; it was
giving something for very little and more for
a surplus. But the unions objected to any-
body being paid more than the minimum, it
being an inducement to men to at least earn
the minimum. It was apparently feared that
the idea might bring an undesirable kind of
hustler into existence. The co., being quite
unable td persuade the union bosses to accept
more money if it was earned, gave up the
struggle. It couldn’t force high on men
who wouldn’t take them at any price.

Do One Thing Properly,
A HINT REGARDING WORK AND
HEALTH.
The people who most often succeed in life
are not those versatile souls who can turn
their hands to anything—Jack of all trades,
master of none—but those who devote them-
selves to doing one thing only and doing it
well. So it is with business. Not many
people get rich by turning a sewing-machine
which will make anything you like; but for-
tunes are made by an automatic machine
that turns out one little bolt or screw all
day long.
In medicine that which does the most good
is the one which does one thing only, and
does it well —that is, Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People, which make good,
rich, plentiful red blood, and nothing else.
All the good effects which have made Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills famous result from
their wonderful power of blood-making. The
firm step, steady nerves, hearty appetite,
improved brain-power, ironclad indigestion,
firm, red lips and clear eye that are con-
spicuous when Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are
taken—all come from the rich, red blood
that they make.
No better blood and nerve tonic can be
offered you, and if you are ailing or losing
energy you will do well to obtain Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills now. Any chemist can
supply, but ask for Dr. Williams’ and see
that name is on the package.
How and why Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
achieve their wonderful results is explained
in a free book, “Diseases of the Blood,” for
which you should send a postcard to Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co., Box 594 G.P.0.,
Sydney.— Advt.

Heart of Empire Series, No. 4.
Westminster Abbey
founded by Edward the Con-
fessor about 1050 and rebuilt
by Henry 111., though only the
beautiful King Edward Chapel,
the Choir, Chapter House, the
Crypt remain of his work.
Henry VII. made some notable
additions, including his famous
Chapel, a perfect specimen of
the skill of mediaeval architects.
All our kings, from Harold and
William 1., were crowned in the
Abbey, and many
are buried there,
together with
poets, statesmen,
and heroes.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY is a most beautiful and complete link with the glorious
past, round which most great events in England’s history have centred, and it is
fitting that every approach, whether from the Embankment, stately Whitehall,
Old Palace Yard, or Victoria Street, is through broad and spacious thoroughfares,
excellent for vehicular traffic and delightful for motoring.
But for all roads the tyres should be Avons, which are built for speed, resiliency and
durability.
Fit British AVON Tyres—Seven types to choose from:
a weight for every load and a tread for every road .

Puts New Life
Into Your Motor Car
THERE is nothing so annoying as en-
gine trouble, and 80 % of it is caused
by Carbon. That knocking and loss of
power, extravagant use of fuel and slow
response to the throttle are due to just one
thing—carbon in your cylinders. Clean
them out with
m
m
and your car will run as it did the first month—
quietly and full of life.
Five minutes* time is all it requires. Simply
pour an ounce of Carbon Remover into each
cylinder through the spark plug 1 opening. Allow
it to stand 30 to 45 minutes. Then start your
engine and watch the cloud of carbon come out
through the exhaust. You can minimize carbon
accumulation by adding
4 ounces of Carbon Re-
mover to each 10 gallons
of petrol you use.
Safe and Guaranteed
Johnson’s Carbon Remover is
excellent for any type of engine.
It cannot injure the metal in any
way, does not affect the lubrica-
tion or injure the oil in the crank
case. Thousands of letters in
our files bear testimony of the
wonderful results obtained from
Johnson’s Carbon Remover.
Buy a trial tin from your dealer.
Ask him also about Johnson’s
Prepared Wax, a beauty polish
for your motor and Johnson’s
Radiator Cement for leaky radi-
ators. If you have any difficulty
in obtaining Johnson’s Products

J. IRELAND LTD.,
NEWCASTLE.
The late baronet William Clarke, who
many years ago founded an Australian
scholarship at the Royal College of Music,
London, hardly foresaw the possibility of
what might happen to the cost of living in
the meantime, for he only tacked a. main-
tenance-allowance of £1 a week to his provi-
sion for college-fees. The winner of the
prize, too, has to pay the expenses of the
trip to London, and that is no trifle nowa-
days. The student who wins the scholarship
this year (it’s awarded every three years)
has to be overseas by April, 1919, and alto-
"•ether the proposition scarcely seems as in-
viting as it might have done a few years ago,
when it was possible to live at a Maida Yale
hashery for a guinea a week, with roast duck
on Sundays and plenty of sugar with every
meal. You can’t buy ducks at seven for six-
pence in these times.
From Sussex-street: —
Eliminating miracles, the periodical failure of our
great natural resources is about due. A large slab
of the continent gives dismal reports of droughty
conditions, and a good solid drought will find Aus-
tralia worse equipped, bar water supply, to meet it
than she was half a century ago. The greater part
of the wheat crop will be a failure and miles of
valuable stock will rot in the unwinking sun, creating
a horrible dint in the national income when coin will
be wanted badly. . Fallowing for wheat-growing and
conserving fodder for stock are proved propositions
as insurance against drought. With few exceptions
both are ignored by the casual cocky. The worst
of it is that if this drought happens one of the
main standbys to feed stock will be the wheat-
stacks which accumulated in this country because
we were too languid to build ships. The grain
that should have been sold abroad at a good price
to help pay some of our lamentable debts will be
consumed here by starving stock. One asset will
eat another, and we will be so much poorer. The dog
that starts in to eat its own tail is a mere circum-
stance comparatively. Every Government in Aus-
tralia, through its Department of Agriculture, advo-
cates fallowing and fodder conservation as essentials
to the proper working of the land. Why, therefore,
not a law compelling the fallowing of a proportion
of cultivated areas in arable districts served by
railways, and the conserving of enough fodder to
meet the carrying capacity of every holding for
12 months’ drought? It isn’t such a big order.
Fifteen acres of wheat in a decent year will provide
enough ensilage to feed 500 sheep for something like
200 days, and in the worst droughts fallowed crops
have shown a profitable return. Such a law would
preserve and increase production, help pay the big
bills, provide freight for non-paving railways, and,
unless the Agricultural Departments are monstrous
liars, make the cocky prosperous.
Dandenong Advertiser (Vic.) reports that
at the conclusion of a local function the
audience sang “God Save the Ling.” The
stinking-fish policy again!
“Geofred” : Pat Grogan had recently been
appointed ganger in the construction branch
of the railway line, and was proud of
the fact. He made no effort to hide the
fact that he was ganger, and, being a big,
burly Irish-Australian who could use his
fists, he commanded respect from his team of
navvies. One day a frail, feeble-looking
little woman, carrying a young baby in her
arms, came along, looking for a wife deserter.
She walked up to Pat and inquired in a
tired, humble voice “Are you the ganger?”
For fully two minutes Grogan looked pity-
ingly on her, amazed at the stupidity of such
a superfluous question. Then, he yelled:
“Clancy, come here. Now, look here, me
man, I’ll have no more of your cheek. If I
have to tell you agin about yer backslinging
off you go—understand?” “But, boss,”
starts Clancy. “To Hell wid yer ‘but’; I
arsked yer did you understand “ Yes,
boss,” from Clancy, as he walks back to his
end of the line. “Smith, you go and get yer
pay and vamoose to-night.” “You, there,
Brown, yev been long enough on this job, so
jest hand in your ticket, get your money, and
flit.” He waited to let the impression soak
'in, then turned to the by-this-time-terrified
woman and in a voice of milk and honey
inquired, “Now, mum, am I the blanky
ganger?”
“M.” : Even now England cannot get away
from its traditional ideas about the value of
the pheasant —a bird which makes poor eat-
ing but good shooting for the rich. An indi-
vidual brought before one of the tribunals
which considers whether a man is more valu-
able in Britain that he would be in France
revealed the mysteries of pheasant-breeding.
He was, he explained, a manufacturer of
imitation game eggs. The hen pheasant is
not an industrious mother, and in order
that the eggs should not be wasted they are
removed and placed under an ordinary barn-
yard fowl, and the imitation eggs—made in
every -respect, including the sound they give
when knocked by another egg, are substi-
tuted to deceive ma pheasant. When the
real eggs are ready for hatching they are
replaced, and the pheasant gets her brood
and is saved from disappointment and nerve
collapse. The tribunal listened respectfully,
decided that the faker’s work was of national
importance, and granted him six months’
exemption. It was also hinted that, if he
joined the war-work volunteers, he need not
worry about the future.
“Mustard Gold”: Cecil Plains station,
taken over recently by the Queensland Gov-
ernment for repatriation purposes, was one
of the first sections of pastoral land staked
by the early bullockies who toiled up from
Sydnev-side to open the Darling Downs.
Old “Big-headed” Taylor, the man whose
, luck gave him this fine patch of country, did
well enough out of the venture to leave close
on three-quarters of a million to surviving
relatives, who abound in the neighborhood of
Drayton and Toowoomba. If new blood
can be settled on the acquired territory, to
supplant the doddering old-fogeyism which
retards the development of the Downs,
the Repatriation officials will have earned
the gratitude of posterity. There are people
about Toowoomba who jamb themselves in the
doorways of their groceries and pubs, and
still hold forth about the atrocities of Crom-
well with a view of keeping their progeny
alive to the iniquities of England. Not the
advancement of the Australian Common-
wealth, nor the cultivation of an Australian
national'sentiment, but Home Rule for Ire-
I land is the aim and absorbing passion of a
[ big section of these inhabitants.

NO BLADE SO KEEN
NO SHAVE SO CLEAN.
The Ballad of a Queen’s
Fortune.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the careless singing man
Went down the rosy way
To where the shouting river ran
Across its boulders grey
Beneath a little bridge’s span
To join the laughing bay.
Green was the hat upon his head
And green his jerkin breast;
Upon his sleeve a jewel red
Flashed back the shining west,
Where the great sun sank to his bed
In curtained glory drest.
The knights came riding two and two
Back from the jousting field ;
And one had bound a scarf Of blue
Across his golden shield.
Ob, soft and low at call of dew
The bell of evening pealed.
The singing man has gone his way,
Nor horse nor shield has he;
Yet all along in rosy play
His shadow dances free—
A king may walk at set of day
Less blithe of memory.
The king is in his counting-house,
He counts the good red gold ;
In wainscot dusks a little mouse
Grows vain and overbold;
And venison and speckled grouse
Are in the larder's hold.
The cooks have set the spits to turn
Before the red, sweet fire,
Where three ells wide the great logs burn
To make the white boar’s pyre ;
And pages fill the silver urn
With wine of heart’s desire.
The singing man is blithe of lip,
Though none be by to hear;
He trolls a stave of lovership
And kisses warm and dear;
The music in his finger-tip
A silver string makes clear.
The queen is on a satin chair,
Her looks are soft and sunny—
Oh, grouse and mouse and courtly care,
What would a king with money,
Who owns the gold upon her hair
Above her cakes and honey?
The singing man his fiddle-bow
Has set to some old tune
As sweet as hawthorn buds that grow
To haws at death of June.
The sun is set; he will not go
Till shining of the moon.
The queen at rising of the wine
Will leave the feast in hall;
Across the twisted ivy-shine
A shrill night-bird will call ;
And there will come a whisper fine
Below the turret wall.
The king will wait for bite and sup,
With all his knights a-throng;
The king will lift the loving-cup
And call for harp and song —
Oh, singing man, the moon is up
Three ells above the wall.
Below the bridge the shouting stream
Goes dancing to the sea
And every bubble is a-gleam
In that loud minstrelsy,
And every little starry dream
Laughs through the willow-tree.
Beyond the bridge in moonlit grass
Twain horses strain their tether ;
A singing man and merry lass
Have walked the way together;
Now who would ride the mountain pass
This moon of honey weather?
The king is heavy on the" stair,
Thfr red wine in his feet;
His brow is wrinkled with the care
Of crown and kingly seat —
Ho. loose his robe and give him air
To cool the royal heat!
With flying hoof and jingling rein
Across the world they fly.
Oh, singing man. the sweet of pain
Is in the moon’s bright eye .
On wooded hill and grassy plain
Are many deaths to die.
The king’s bed is of satin laid;
And twelve good knights and bold
Have stripped him of his robe and braid
And loosed his cloth of gold ;
And. under blanket, priests have prayed
“God shield him from the cold.”
With flying hoof and beating heart
Across the world they fly. _
Now who shall hold these twain apart.
The mountain pass is nigh ;
And rocky echoes singing start
As swift bits jingle by.
The king’s house is a goodly house,
With bread and wine in store,
And white boar’s head and game and grous<
Within the larder door ;
And in the dark the wainscot mouse
Can hear the royal snore.
And up and up the hill they went
’Neath fir and twisted oak.
The weary horses gallop-spent
Lagged ere the morning broke.
The white sun from his cloudy tent
A word of fearing spoke.
The matin bell is loud and free;
The queen is late for prayer.
What sound is this from sward and sea
That fills the morning air?
Loud war-horns, over grass and tree
Blowing a land’s despair.
Ho! Shake the smith awake and tell
The armorer to bring
The casque with rivets hammered well
Their shafts aside to fling.
Put swift hands to the castle bell
And call to knight and king.
The mountain path was leafy green.
The long mists rolled below ;
And dim and far the peaks were seen
Top-turreted with snow—-
Oh, singing man, is this a queen
Who sleeps where rushes grow?
It is a queen ; and well she sleeps
On that soft bed and sunny.
What recks she of the care that keeps
Kings’ crowns and royal money?
The wheat is good that true love reaps
And sweet wild bees have honey.
The knights went riding two and two
To meet the angry foe;
And one has bound a scarf of blue
llis streaming crest below;
And one has tied a satin shoe
Upon his long yew bow.
All. well! They fought as gallants will
Between the wall and sea ;
And fast they fell as foemen still
Strove with them knee to knee;
And there was sorrow on the hill
And death ’neath vine and tree.
Ah. well! They rode the mountain track
That singing man and queen,
The fiddle hanging on his back
More than a crown I ween;
And never found they loss or lack
Of gladness in the green.
The heavy king among his knights
Bode dauntlessly and well.
Of all his deeds and all his fights
O’er wine the harpers toll;
And halls afar grow loud o’ nights
With praise of how lie fell.
But they rode forward day on day
Across the" mountain pass,
And found a place with blossom gay
And green with happy grass
Where it seemed good to them to stay,
A man and merry lass.
They kept a hive of honey bees
And three red cows for cream ;
And white ewe-fleece for woman knees
Is kirtle sweet as dream —
Oh, dreams are good beneath high trees
With happy light astream.
And in the kings’ old counting house
New kings may count their money,
Or store of venison or grouse,
Bow-sliot on mornings sunny,
While, beady-eyed, the wainscot mouse
Blinks greed for cakes and honey.
But she was queen and he was king,
Set on two thrones apart; ...
She,' crowned with all that he could sing,
Rode on a market cart
Through all the gay imagining
Of leafy summer’s heart.
A peasant man and peasant wife —
Blow horns across the land!
The battle flags are gay for strife,
The keen blades in each hand....
But these had found the key of life —
To love and understand.
N.S.W.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fTM HE salmon-gums, flat-topped like cedars,
I swayed gently at the end of the main
street of Golden Cross, where one
boom had died and the next was yet years
away. The township’s one newspaper, the
Golden Age, was about to make one of its
thrice-a-week publications. The printer, in
his long, narrow, dusty office behind the edi-
torial room, behind the dental surgery, be-
hind the drug-store, waited for the leading
article, without which superstition no paper
with “traditions” may go to press. Few are
expected to read it; but a newspaper without
a leader .is like a circus without a tent, a
councillor without foolishness, a Hamlet
without Ophelia. Therefore must the printer
sit staring vacantly into the yard where the
golden air became rarefied with heat, so that
the old proofs and spoil sheets danced for a
moment their dervish dance of the willy-
willy, and then were motionless until a new
rarefaction of the air ended in another little
whirlwind. , , ,
Bullant Johnson —Bullant named not by
his godfathers and his godmothers at his bap-
tism, but by reason of his tremendous energy
and persistence —had commenced his leader
with every certainty of finishing it; but the
artist is rarely without the interference of
the sordid business of life. The article had
begun well thus: —
THE SINEWS OF WAR.
There are, in this town, a few citizens —otherwise
estimable —who studiously neglect the bounden duty
of all business people — i.e., to support then-local
newspaper. A town without a newspapei is but a
railway tank, A newspaper gives a settlement the
dignity of a town generally, at the expense of the
most enterprising and ill-paid man of the com-
munity—the newspaper proprietor. If the people of
Golden Cross were to send to Perth for clothes and
beer and horseshoes and tinned dog, the cries of
local tailors and drapers and publicans and store-
keepers would be heard from Tuanme to Ora Banda.
The proprietor of this paper fills locallv all his
wants Golden Cross is capable of answering. He
does not send to the city for socks or clothes or
boots or food. He buys these on the spot, and is
rewarded by the confidence of his fellow-citizens,
and, irritated by the few ungrateful traders who
take all the results of his advocacy of this great
undeveloped mining district, and all his local protec-
tion for the things they sell, while fostering a most
callous form of Freetrade in the things they buy.
Publicity is the staple we sell; and no man has the
right to #
It was just at that point Bullant Johnson
was called away to the front shop to make
up a prescription for a man whose consump-
tion of whisky had enabled him to discover
peculiar animals which never yet were seen
on land or sea. ITe went to his side-line of
medicine impatiently, for he was interested
in his indictment of bad citizenship. The
printer, looking into the office and seeing the
empty chair, secured the two finished slips
of copy and departed with it to the waiting
compositors. They made a mouthful of it,
and the printer was workless again. He was
aggrieved. He felt that a leader-writer
should have no other goods but leaders, and
that Bull ant’s other activities were a mis-
take. ... ,
These other activities were a drug-store
and dispensary and a dental department—
the latter conducted mainly for extractions.

A MAN IS AS STRONC AS HIS BACK.
A Man can only do as much work as his back will stand.
Once the back gives out he must lay down his tools.
But that is not all, for Backache tells of sick kidneys. Other unmistakable signs are dizziness,
stiffness of the limbs, sick headache and sleeplessness. Before long the patient crows nervous'
short tempered and depressed; the eyes become heavy and sunken, with swellings beneath

them, and the color flies from the cheeks. There is of
serious kidney disease, rheumatism and dropsy. The liquid
poison which causes kidney troubles is driven from the body
quickly and thoroughly by the genuine Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. This great medicine will strengthen your back by reliev-
ing and toning up the kidneys.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. Chap. Anderson, 21 Wyndham Street,
Alexandria, Sydney, says:—“My back
troubled me for a. long time, the sharp, shoot-
ing pains making my life a misery. I could
not stoop and suffered great pain trying to
get about to do my work. Even when lying
in bed at night I got no ease. I could not
get anything to give me relief, although I
used a great many remedies. However, I at
last got a thoroughly good remedy in Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. These' wonderful
pills stopped the pain like magic, and I have
been quite free of it for two years now. No
one need endure the agony of backache, for
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills will certainly
cure this ailment.”
Mrs. Anderson confirms the above, nine
years later: —“I can now add the important
fact that I have been free of backache ever
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me eleven years ago.”
Testimony

Sydney
Residents,
A MAN'S CASE.
Mr. W. J. Frappell, who has been in the
employ of Messrs. Wright, Heaton and Co.,
for over twenty-five years, says:—“lt gives
me pleasure to testify to the curative value
of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I had
been suffering with an aching back for a
number of years, and at times it was very
severe. After trying many remedies without
getting any ease whatever, I was advised to
use Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. I did so,
and from the first dose got relief, and after
using three bottles I was entirely free of
the backache. I am thoroughly cured, and
hope this statement will meet the eye of
other sufferers, and be the means of them
getting relief through the use of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills.”
Mr. Frappell confirms the above, sixteen
years later: —“My cure by Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills has proved permanent. I have
been perfectly free of backache for the last
sixteen years.”

Bullant’s cheerfulness lost him his impa-
tience before he had covered the distance
from the editor’s room through the dental
surgery to the drug-store. His spare frame
was all wire and whipcord ; his eyes full of
kindly humor. He had a big nose that looked
the larger because it was set in a thin face,
the moustache of a viking, and an ever-
laughing mouth with a cigarette held in it
for almost every waking minute. He wore
trousers as wide as a man-o’-war’s man’s,
and a soft shirt buttoned no higher than the
breast-bone. He wore a coat once a quarter.
Bullant. worshipped fresh air, and his shirt
and waistcoat followed his devotional lead
slavishly.
He supplied the customer with soda sul-
phate and a bath sponge—his mind intent
on the article which was to convert the crim-
inals who did not advertise locally. As soon
as the customer turned to leave the shop he
ran back to the editorial chair and lost him-
self in the pleasure of saying exactly the
thing he meant: —
——and no man has the right to so forget his debt
to the community that shelters and maintains him,
to boycott the local production for the foreign.
“Mr. Johnson.”
“Another cry from Macedonia,” said Bull-
ant. “What can I do for you, ma’am? Ah!
The little toofies, eh?”
The interrupter was a little old woman,
who was sixty and looked seventy ; her face
sun-darkened and life-marked to the color of
a Walnut shell, so deep and complicated were
the wrinkles. She put her left hand to her
jaw and mumbled in her pain.
“Yes, Mister Johnson—me teeth.”
“Come along—lot’s have a look. In
here. _ Get into the chair, please. It’ll
be all right. My! There’s a nasty toofy-peg
—and there’s two more. Take cocaine?”
“No. I did before and it made me sick,
Mister Johnson?”
“All right! The painless method of pull-
ing them’s quick. Now ! No ! I won’t pull
’em yet.. . .jist to look for the pain. Ha!”
“Ouch !”
“One.”
“Caw-w-w.”
“Two—nearly finished.”
“Warruk.”
“Three—right! You’re a soldier.”
The old woman fumbled at a mysterious
pocket in her poor old skirt; and said, as if
she were ashafned of talking money to an
artist:
“How much, Mister Johnson?”
“Nothing, nothing! You were so plucky,
i*nd I never charge for painful extraction.
Why; except for two or three crow-noises, you
never squealed. Go right along, mother. It’s
all right.”
“But I must pay somethin’, Mister John-
son.”
“No—only promise me one thing.”
“Yes, Mister Johnson.”
“When you cut some more teeth come
back here, and I’ll pull ’em again for
nothing.”
She laughed her appreciation of his joke,
shook hands with him, told him she’d tell
her old man who was down at their camp
“on the clam,” and left him. He watched
the brave old bushwoman go down the dusty
street —an old woman worn to the bone with
work and the privation of following her
teamster-husband over the dry tracks. Her
old boots curled upwards at the toes. She
was free of pain and doubly cheerful be-
cause the money in the mysterious pocket
of the old dress had not been required. Bull-
ant felt glad that he had made no charge;
and returned to leader-writing:—
-boycott the local production for the foreign.
We are not asking for anything but orders for the
advertising that pays. The circulation of the
Golden Age through the old-established centres of
Never Never, Fifty-one Valley, Yuanmi, Ora Banda,
Dead Finish, and in the rapidly-developing gold-
fields of Hit or Miss and Lot’s Wife entitle it to
local advertising even if the indirect services of the
paper in the progress of these districts were not as
considerable as
“Oh! What do you want? Oh, it’s you,
old man !”
“Yes,” said I. “There was nobody in the
shop and I could hear your mind working,
so I came in.”
“It’s a wonder you don’t hear my brains
creak, with all the interruptions I’ve had.
There’s the Archimedean lever at the back
waiting to print, and just as soon as I get
fairly started into literature I’ve to knock
off to sub-edit an old lady’s teeth, and she
made crow noises while I was extracting by
the painful method—absolutely without com-
fort. And now you.”
“I want six-pennyworth of quinine sul-
phate, Bullant.”
“There’s no first-aid about that. Wait
a minute, old man, till I polish off this
leader.”
“Who gets fits this week —the Czar or
Woodrow Wilson, or the Kaiser?”
“None of ’em. This is the non-advertisers’
Waterloo. I’ll be through in a jiff. I’ll cut
ic short.”
He read the conclusion aloud as he wrote
with the ever-present cigarette dropping its
ash on the copy-paper and making a blotter
unnecessary:—
-in the progress of these districts were not as
considerable as the community knows them to be.
With that informed knowledge of our own value as a
factor in the development of this country, ad-
equately recognised by the few as by the many, we
have no doubt that the two important traders who
aie not yet in our advertising columns will wipe out
the shame of their selLexclusion without delay.
“There! Boy ! The printer—tell him to
read the proofs himself and let her go—now
for sordid trade again.”
I followed him to the store where he
weighed out sixpenny-worth of quinine sul-
phate, and saying, “That’ll be half a crown,”
he punched it upon the cash-register.
“Half a crown for sixpenn’orth?”
“Yes—that’s the tariff to friends. You
can have a bob’s worth for three-and-six.
Come over to the saloon and we’ll blew it.”
The life of a merchant is full of roguery—
for as a nail sticketh between the points of
the boards so does theft stick between buying
and selling. But I never heard a fairer
commercial proposition ; so we went over to
Joe’s bar and the over-charge for the quinine
was liquidated.
That was when Bullant most powerfully
impressed me with the belief that advertising
pays—with especial regard to the recalci-
trance of Toogood, a draper who monopolised
the definite article, and called himself always,
"Toogood, The Draper.” .
"Toogood’s a goat,” said Bullant. “He
advertises in the big dailies because they
have a big circulation; although very little
of the big circulation is ever likely to touch
him or his rags. Because my paper doesn’t
have a circulation as big as the Waily Tale
he won’t see that such circulation as it has
got is all local and influences trade for him.
I m going up to strike him for an advt. now,
and if he doesnt rise to it this trip I’ll
leave him m outer darkness for the rest of
his life. Let’s have another; and come along
with me and see the fun.”
Toogood is an excessively polite and ex-
ceedingly firm man a big, kindly, soft fel-
low who can say “No” and mean it in a
voice as sweet as Turkish delight.
“Good morning, Bullant,” he said. “Good
morning, my dear chap. What can I show
you this morning?”
“I’ve to do the showing, Toogood. All
the demonstration is on me. I want to see
you about a double-column ad., front page,
change your matter weekly, three insertions
a week, and only £250 a year—a double-
column ad. for £250 a year—4B running
inches, three times a week, is 144 inches,
is 7200 inches a year. About 9d. an inch.”
“But Bullant”
“Aow, it’s no use talking. Here you get
7200 inches of beautiful big type for about
9d. an inch, and I throw in two or three
paragraphs about the clearing New Year sale
that’s always going on. I’ll send up our
fashion editor to do the Spring millinery.”
“That’s the fashion editor who never but-
tons her waistcoat. Bullant.”
“You’ve got it, Toogood—she writes para-
graphs about Paris models when she isn’t
sub-editing the teeth of the masses. Now!
You’ve got to do it. S’posing I went to
the city to buy socks and waistcoats?”
“The city wouldn’t get rich on all the
waistcoat-buttons you’d buy, Bullant.”
“Well! If I did, and everybody else did,
yo “R,,r ta ;f V tn ol " if froze ? ol l t -” ,
But it you buy socks from me you get
socks, and if I buy advertising from you T
money” e Set * customer £or
“You don’t believe that my advertising
would show a profit? Now! Toogood—
advertising pays. Get that? Advertising
pays ! Even if you can’t always have it
it pays. It tells peo'ple that Toogood’s still
on earth, and that Toogood runs a clearing
sale from January to December, and that
Toogood’s not too‘bad. And that exaggera-
tion is worth something. Now the contract,
Toogood. You can’t be the only store in
town standing outside the gate of'the adver-
tiseEs paradise.”
You re a wonder, Bullant—a wonder. I’d
“oS?SSOTS&S? 1 loolt *• “
“You do—honestly? Nothing nersonal
against the paper or the town?
because you think you’ll never see a return
for your money?”
“If you can show me a return for any ad-
vertisement, I’ll make the contract you
want ’
“Then you’ll have to take the risk of the
little ad. There’s no free ads. in the paper
—except the free ad. every paper gives to the
little self-advertisers who wear the stairs out
climbing up with paragraphs about tliem-
selves.”
“I’ll risk—two shillings. A ‘Wahted’ ad.,
now. The people who want work read
advertisements more than the people who
want to spend money—unless they’re women,
of course; and but for women, husbands
would be rich and drapers poor.”
“Right you are—a ‘Wanted’ ad. What is
it, Toogood?”
“I’ve had a notice of boys wanted in the
window for a week, and nobody’s applied.
Just put it this way—
Strong, healthy boy wanted ; good start and pro-
motion in the business for a willing lad.
Toogood., The Draper.
And there’s the two shillings. Now the
conditions are that the ad. must be answered
to-morrow or—no contract.”
“It’s a deal.”
“And you mustn’t send any boys to apply,
Bullant.”
“What?”
“I beg your pardon—l know you wouldn’t.”
“And you’re a witness, old man—though a
witness isn’t wanted. Toogood’s word’s
enough. Let’s get back to the office. I’ll
stop the machine and get this in for to-
morrow’s paper.”
While I stood by the composing-frame he
set up Toogood’s test advertisement—set it
himself as if the contract for full double-
column depended on the composition. He
gave it a black-letter heading, “Boy Wanted” ;
and stood over the 'foreman while it was
dropped into (he forme on the imposing sur-
face—“|°P of column next leader.” He
chuckled as lie directed me to the special
position.
“When old Toogood sees that, old man,”
said Bullant, “he’ll give me that contract,
hoy or no boy.”
“But lie’s pretty sure to have one applica-
tion.”
“I’ll disguise myself by buttoning up my
waistcoat and apply for the job myself, if it
comes to the worst.” '
He showed me the Golden Age, and the
Tfl morning, and
admned the production as if it were epic,
waited in the inner office while he sub-
Cfll , teeth and dispensed medicine, and then
a telephone message called him to Toogood’s.
, Ja,t an hour later he called me over to Joe’s
>!U "' , was hi good fettle and waved a
GG^, ract s , l^' ae< ? by Toogood agreeing to pay
s'~° tor ‘‘>4 insertions, full double column,
hont page,
“You got it?”
“Got it? Sure! You saw the test ad. in
the rag this morning?”
r* t
V , But what beats me is that they
lt d J. e ° re the paper was circulated this
. . ,
they saw it in the printing office then?”
“Not much—they applied at Toogood’s pri-
vate house. Mrs. Toogood’s got twins.”

The New Valveless
Carburetor for
Schebier
Fords.
No Equipment is too good for
THE LIBERTY AEROPLANE
particularly the CARBURETOR, Consider for a
second the requirements necessary for a Vaporiser
attached to such a highly-important Machine.
It must produce rapid ACCELERATION. Ample
POWER at full throttle for hours at a stretch.
An even MIXTURE at all altitudes and positions
—now at sea-level and horizontal; in a few
minutes, at 20,000 feet and ascending vertically;
and, finally, it must have thorough reliability and
few moving parts. Such a Carburetor ought to
he good enough for your Engine, and that Car-
buretor is THE NEW VALUELESS SCHEBLER,
which is the same design as used on THE
LIBERTY AEROPLANE. It is impossible to
describe in detail all the special features r\f
The New Valveless
Schebler.
Sufficient to say that it is A NON-MOVING-PART CARBURETOR, and a decided
advance in the science of Carburetion; incorporating several new features and principles.
The only model on sale at present is suitable for
THE FORD CAR.
It can be easily attached by any owner-driver. * PRICE £5 Complete.
