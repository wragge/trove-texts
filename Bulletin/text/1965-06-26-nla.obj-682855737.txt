Imagine a room with a view of the Taj.
A woman inspired it. An artist designed it. Devoted
artisans lovingly carved its milk-white marble. Persian
craftsmen inlaid it with gems. The rising sun bathes
it rose-pink; the moon turns it ice-blue. No photograph
has ever truly captured it. But you can.
The Taj Mahal is one of myriad delights awaiting you
in friendly, hospitable India. Where to go? What to
see? You’ll find Air-India so helpful. They work hand
in glove with your travel agent in careful trip-planning.
And they don’t lose interest in you after you’ve arrived.
There are Air-India offices throughout India—and in
any of them you’ll get a helpful V.I.P. reception. (And
we can reserve you a room with a view of the Taj—at
the splendid Clark-ShirazHotel).

MASTER-KEYED SYSTEMS
A Master-Keyed System is one in which each
.lock has its own individual key, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain • locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to.the Master-Key.

GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock ,has its own individual key which
operates that lock only and no other, but the
locks are divided into two or more groups.
Each group is subject to its own Master-Key,
which opens all locks in that group, but no
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all locks in,
ail groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike
groups may also be included in G.M.K. Systems.

National Notebook
La Stupenda
TTow does one describe Joan Suther-
land? She’s not good-looking, she’s
not pretty, but by heaven’s she’s awe-
inspiring. When she entered the reception
at the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne
she towered. Her hair was a rich maho-
gany and she admitted that when let go
it came half way down her back.
She wore a long chinchilla coat which
made her look even bigger than she really
is. Around her neck was a triple chain
of large, beautifully matched pearls. On
her wrist was an amethyst bracelet and
she had a matching ring, the lovely
amethyst surrounded by diamonds. Miss
Sutherland talked at one end of the
room, her husband, Richard Bonynge,
talked at the other. He is dark, he smiles
easily, and for male company he is
really too good-looking. He wore a blue
silk suit, pale blue shirt, black tie and
black shoes which looked distinctly
Italian.
Unlike so many arrivals of her rank
she laughed, and seemed to love the mass
questioning. Only occasionally did she
close off her smile and this happened im-
mediately upon the asking of any ques-
tions regarding booking or the conduct-
ing of Mr Bonynge. Then she made it
perfectly clear to the entire assembled
party that she considered her husband
a first-class musician and she thanked
him for her career. But then she didn’t
mind talking about Maria Callas. “I have
enjoyed her performances to the nth
degree. I admire Maria and I am grateful
to her. She inspired me to sing some of
the roles I do best. When 1 heard her
sing ‘Lucia Di Lammermoor’ and ‘La
Traviata’ I was convinced I could reach
such heights, too.
“Another Melba? Oh, dear, that’s
being presumptuous. We all admire and
are grateful to Melba. She inspired me
to have the guts to go overseas.”
Was she temperamental? “Mmmm, I
lose my temper easily if I’m tired. But I
don’t think I have a reputation for a bad
temper. It doesn’t do you any good any-
way.” She explained her program. . . .
She would be singing three operas a week,
more than she normally did overseas,
where she averaged 100 a year. Then
came a horrible question: “Only three a
week; how’ll you fill in your time, then?”
“FILL IN MY TIME ... I shall spend
my time in bed.” There were no arthri-
tic troubles, no sinus trouble; she insisted
that she was a strong, healthy girl, better
than at any time for 14 years. Yes, she
had been homesick. “Not morbid about
it though. It would be hard to leave
Europe where we live and work so much.
We have a place in London and a place
in Switzerland where we go away to,
above Montreux.”
The music critics were not there for
this great occasion. So there were few
technical questions on her work. She
did admit she had trouble with language.
“My French is appalling.” And on
modern English language operas: “I’ve
done my fair share of that. I’m much
more interested in reviving great operas
that have been forgotten.” Mercifully
she does not intend to hand back her
CBE. “There’s no reason to hand it back.
Why shouldn’t the Beatles get their
MBEs. Everything’s loosening up now.
They’re artists in their own right.” Jazz?
“Yes I like some exponents of jazz and I
adore Ella Fitzgerald and I adore Lena
Horne.”
She was very charming, very patient,
and she would have been prepared to go
on for another hour. It was the Press
that got the first guilt complex. Other
guests were beginning to glare. It wasn’t
fair to monopolise La Stupenda for so
long.
Can a Man
T?ighting the dirty war in Vietnam
A has proved thirsty work for the
1000 Diggers with the First Battalion
of the Royal Australian Regiment
stationed 'at the Bien Hoa airbase
particularly when the camp remains
“dry”. But the Queen’s birthday a fort-
night ago helped matters.
At dusk the Diggers lined up for their
first beer ration issue since arriving
from Australia two weeks before. There
was not much room for elation. The
ration was meagre and the battalion’s
spokesman, Major A. Hinds, announced:
“Today’s issue of a can a man was in
honor of a national celebration. Other-
wise the camp remains dry.”
“Baring” in Mind
A fter doing a good job publicising
the Australian production of “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf” (in which
he found 95 blasphemies, 14 swear
words and five visual acts of indecency),
Brisbane’s self-appointed defender of
morals, dentist Alan Russell, is turning
his attention to the controversial produc-
tion of Les Ballets Africains.
Mr Russell contends that J. C. Wil-
liamson’s determination to stage David
Mcllwraith’s presentation of bare-
breasted girls is a deliberate assault on
__ Australia’s morals —even a dire racial
confrontation: an “attempt by African
non-whites to lower our standards to
meet theirs”. In a telegram to The
Bulletin last week he said:
“Decent people consider top dressing
a fundamental requirement for a proper
relationship between sexes, and resent
this foreign attempt to upset a national
custom. Non-enforcement of law would
create a precedent for bare-breasted girls
in hotel floor-shows, sideshow tents, and
other public places.
“To make an exception of girls from
Guinea would perplex and perhaps anger
our own colored women now observing
civilised dress rules. Similarly, it would
create tremendous difficulties for Aus-
tralian mothers now teaching modesty to
teenage daughters already under pressure
from many quarters to defy convention.
(Signed) Alan Russell, Colwill Place,
Brisbane.”
The Great Dream
A n energetic young salesman in the
rag trade has confided in The
Bulletin that his great dream of a big
killing in brassieres and panties has been
dashed beyond recall.
He has a girl-friend apparently who

is (or was) a marching girl. If you do
not know about marching girls you will
be surprised to learn that there are
about 12,000 of these sturdy lasses
marching up and down throughout the
land every weekend. The numbers in-
crease week by week. It is a sport, or
pastime if you like, which is booming.
Now our salesman noticed that, well,
the girls might be improved a little if
they had a few extra curves and showed
a little more, er, of what nature endowed
them with. He had in mind performing
a service for marching girls akin to that
done by Teddy Tinling for the tennis
girls at Wimbledon.
Our man visualised 12,000 pairs of
specially designed bras and panties in
appropriate club colors. Each girl, he
felt, could be persuaded to buy at least
three sets a year and there would be
new recruits coming in every year. It
looked great.
But he got a very stern rebuff when
he tried to enlist the aid of his girl-
friend in a selling campaign. The officials
took a very dim view of the whole idea.
Australian marching girls, it seems, are
not like that.
It was a good try, anyway.
Fresh Air
r I a he Victorian Branch of the Associa-
tion of Social Workers of Australia
has let fresh air into the controversy in
Victoria on how to prevent police from
hitting or otherwise intimidating sus-
pected or arrested persons. It puts aside
as impractical, suggestions like those of
Mr Justice Sholl, of the Victorian
Supreme Court, that tape - recorders,
shorthand writers or independent wit-
nesses should be obligatory at police
interrogations.
The Police Association was the first
to say, in replying to Sir Reginald Sholl,
that no one could make such devices
effective. The Association of Social
Workers agrees, and suggests another
tack. Why not give the public more
protection by • reforming the peculiar
system by which the Police Department
receives and deals with complaints? At
present, any complaint is referred to a
police inspector, who decides on his
own initiative whether the complainant
may have a case.
If the inspector so decides, the police-
man complained against is either taken
directly before the Chief Commissioner,
who deals with it in camera, or is re-
ferred to a Discipline Board. The board
consists of a magistrate and a police
officer. Sittings may be public or in
camera. The Association of Social
Workers would like the board changed
to include responsible citizens, owing no
allegiance to the police or to any other
branch of the Attorney-General’s Depart-
ment.
Meanwhile, the police, as a routine,
deny that bashing or malpractice is
common in its 4000-man force. Un-
fortunately, it is impossible for anyone
outside to get reliable information. But
Sir Reginald Sholl thinks the position
so bad that the public have already lost
confidence in police impartiality and
fairness. Many probation officers and
other social workers agree that something
must be done.
Talk Of The Lindsays
“T>eople have been saying for years
that the history of my family ought
to be recorded,” Sir Daryl Lindsay said.
“Lionel was the one who should have
written it. I tried to kid him into doing
it. but he was getting old then and was
bored with the whole business. So now
I’ve written it myself.”
Sir Daryl’s story will be published later
this year by Cheshire. It is titled “The
Leafy Tree”, which is the meaning of
“Lisnacreive”, the name of a house in
Ireland that earlier Lindsays occupied
for 150 years, and the name that Sir
Daryl’s father, Robert, gave to his house
in Creswick, Victoria, when he settled
there in 1863 to practise medicine.
“The whole family except one there
were ten of us were born in that ramb-
ling old house,” Sir Daryl said. “What I’ve
tried to do is to describe the family back-
ground: what it was like c&ming out
here in the gold rush, and then living in
the atmosphere of that mining town,
which was a pretty tough, amusing place.
And I've told the story of what we all
did when we left home. There's some
unusual stuff in it. Lionel, for instance,
started off as an astronomer. Very few
people know that. He won a scholarship
and went down to the Melbourne observa-
tory. He was there for a while, and then
he contradicted something of the Astro-
nomer Royal’s and was sent home. It
turned out afterwards he was right, I be-
lieve. He was a brilliant boy, Lionel; very
good at mathematics and languages. He
was the moving spirit of the Lindsays.”
Sir Daryl said that his book assesses
the achievements of his brothers, but no,
he would rather not disclose how he
summed them up. Which of them, then,
had he -admired most as a painter?
“Percy!” he replied without hesitation.
“Percy! He was the best of the whole
lot of us. He had a tender way of paint-
ing, and a lovely, natural, color sense.
If it came down to the quality of paint-
ing, and you put Lionel, Norman and
Percy together, one of those little land-
scapes of Percy’s, to a man who was
interested in painting, would knock the
rest of them rotten. That’s my taste
anyway. Lionel was a romantic, as
Norman is, but Percy was just a simple
chap going through life with a very
sensitive mind. There are nice stories
about old Percy. He had a very warm
nature. He would give his last bob
away to anybody. He was the same as
my father in that way he loved being
with people.”
“The Leafy Tree” will have a fore-
word by Sir Robert Menzies. “All this
talk of the Lindsays it’s rather embar-
rassing,” Sir Daryl said. “I think he’s
made the point in his foreword that Cres-
wick will be known not only for its gold
but also as the birthplace of the famous
Lindsays —something to that effect. Well,
yes, I suppose it's true.”
SOLDIER'S PAY
feuCletCn
80 Years Ago: June 27, 1885
OUR opinions concerning the send-
ing of a force to take part in
the Soudan battle are well known.
From the beginning we considered
Mr Dailey’s interference not only un-
called for, but unconstitutional. And
now the Government has distinguished
itself once more. Four months ago
we objected to its prodigality to-
day we protest against its meanness.
The Contingent is to be disbanded
with a month’s pay for each officer
and man. Had six months’ been given
none would have thought it too much.
Let us examine the case.
They had contracted with their
Government to serve for a period of
12 months, or for two years if re-
quired. They returned at the end of
three months, having lost a few men
by sickness and having brought back
many others who —judging by appear-
ances—will be lucky if they ever
regain their former health. And
their reward is a month's pay
enough perhaps, to bring some of
them to their distant homes, but not
enough to provide them with decent
clothes for the journey. It is mean
in any case. It is especially so when
we remember how many of them left
comfortable homes and good situa-
tions at the call of what they con-
sidered duty. There is scarcely an
officer or a soldier in the returned
force who has • not lost in either
health or purse by the expedition.
And a month's pay is the salve!

The Drought
Australian leadership has failed
even more badly in the drought
emergency than it did for years past
during the defence crisis. It is now
clear that unless the drought breaks
soon, especially in New South Wales
and Queensland, the productive
capacity of the Australian countryside
may be damaged for an indefinite
period. It already seems likely that
wool exports may be halved and
wheat and meat exports eliminated.
Taken along with the possibility of
reduced imports by Britain, United
States and Japan, the restriction of
capital inflow into Australia, and the
need for an increased defence ex-
penditure, the outlook for our affluent
society now looks grim indeed.
The extraordinary thing is that we
find little awareness of this in many
high circles. So used are they to talk-
ing comfortable cliches that some of
them cannot even see an emergency
when it is before their eyes. The
Tn her article on page 39, Dr Coral
Bell of Sydney University cautions
readers against under-estimating the
strength of the American “teach-in”
movement of protest against US policy
in South Vietnam—a movement which
is now finding its imitators in Aus-
tralia. This movement undoubtedly
appeals to more than Communists
and fellow-travellers; indeed it is
attracting people who, on the whole,
support the American policy but feel
confused about some aspects of it.
From one point of view the “teach-
in” movement may represent a genera-
tion of publicists who have forgotten,
if they ever understood, Jhe lessons
not only of the Korean War but even
of the Cuban confrontation. Vietnam
is no local war; what is happening
there is another stage in the same
struggle against Communist imperial-
ism that has / been fought since World
War II on various battlefields from
Greece to the Caribbean.
But there is one other factor which
more seriously concerns the supporters
of President Johnson. Neither before
nor since the bombing of North Viet-
nam have the United States and its
Vietnam and the “Teach-ins”
chairman of the Export Council, for
example, recently discussed the rosy
prospect of rural exports without
bothering to mention the drought, and
the various Governments have still
failed to provide adequate assistance
to the men on the land. As J. C.
Horsfall points out on page 19, steps
to help conserve priceless assets of
stock are still being largely left to the
devices of the farmers themselves.
A massive Government drought
relief programme involving a variety
of banking, taxation and subsidy
policies is urgently called for, but all
we get is Federal buck-passing to the
States and a NSW hay subsidy. It
needs only an inflationary Budget from
Mr Holt —as is expected—and an in-
crease in the basic wage, and the
progress of the Australian economy
could be undermined for years ahead.
In the defence crisis, the national
leadership at least had time on its
side; with the drought, unfortunately,
it has not.
allies a clear sense of their strategy.
We are fighting Communists in Viet-
nam, but, unlike the Communists, we
have one tremendous disadvantage:
we have no precise political goal. Are
we to stay there indefinitely? If we
intend to withdraw, on what sort of
terms? Leaving behind what sort of
a regime?
It is this lack of a political goal—
which the Vietnamese situation has
brought to a head—that has led to
most of the setbacks that the free
world has suffered in Asia since World
War 11. Our programme has rarely
gone beyond the military containment
of the Communists; it has not
succeeded in engaging the political
support of Asian labor unions, student
organisations, peasant federations,
religious societies, women’s groups,
intellectuals’ committees—that is, the
people and groups who make up the
so-called “Asian masses”. Instead, as
the Left has been quick to point out,
by being associated with regimes which
have imprisoned the leaders of these
groups or organised public executions
of them, as is happening in Saigon
this week, we have often given en-
couragement to the Communists.
While the Vietcong monsoon
offensive lasts the immediate problem
is obviously military, but in the long
run what is needed is not so much
more soldiers as more politically
aware people who know what they
want and are prepared to make the
same sacrifices as the Communists.
The lesson of the “teach-ins” is
that the United States has failed to
offer Asian countries anything like
the Grand Design it offered Europe
after World War 11. Former Gov-
ernor-General of India, C. Rajago-
palachari, for example, in a timely,
statement last week, called for an
Indian-Japanese alliance against Com-
munist China the sort of initiative
Americans should already have taken
and which Australia should support.
But unless, even now, it has the back-
ing of the United States, it too will
fail. If the “teach-ins” do no more than
ram home the need for a clear and
total strategy, they will have been
worthwhile.
Sutherland
VTow that Joan Sutherland has finally
arrived, it would be churlish to
give the impression that she is not
welcome by continuing to complain
about the high cost of seats or about
the fact that the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust, supported by the taxpayer, is
backing a private commercial firm.
Both complaints ignore unfortunate
facts of operatic life. What the Suther-
land tour emphasises is that opera is
a luxury which only very generous
governments or very rich and generous
private individuals can help the public
to enjoy.
What can be done on this tour,
however, is to enable a wider cross-
section of Australian opera-lovers to
enjoy the pleasure of seeing and hear-
ing Miss Sutherland. She herself has
made the most constructive suggestion:
music students and other groups such
as pensioners should be admitted to
rehearsals free.
This would not affect ticket sales.
Already many of the Sutherland per-
formances are sold out in Melbourne
and the same thing looks like happen-
ing in other cities. Free admission to
rehearsals may be an unprecedented
move, but, then, Miss Sutherland’s wel-
come return after 14 years is not an
everyday event.


THIS AUSTRALIA
VIETNAM
The Bloodiest Phase
Diversions from Korea and Thailand?
The second Indo-China War has now
entered its bloodiest phase. For the Viet-
cong a situation has developed where
their monsoon offensive has brought
notable tactical gains the decimation
of whole battalions of expert South
Vietnamese troops —but not, so far, that
political victory they require for hard-
fisted talking at the Peace Conference
tables.
They have not succeeded in taking
and holding a provincial centre of
consequence, a pre-requisite to the
establishment of a national liberation

front Government in South Vietnam.
The American position is, therefore, in
spite of the collapse of the latest South
Vietnam Government, still valid; there
is good reason for them to remain there.
What is more important the Vietcong
failure is, in a sense, the most significant
victory enjoyed by South Vietnam since
the war began: it is reasonable to
postulate that if the Vietcong cannot
take a town now (the overwhelming rains
of the monsoon are severely limiting the
employment of American air power),
then they are not likely to be able to
achieve this when the monsoon lifts.
Knowing this, Washington pursuing
its hardest line policy since the Berlin
confrontation has decided to put
20,000 more troops into Vietnam, bring-
ing her strength to 75,000 men and a
capability, if necessary, to put in eight
divisions of combat forces.
Victory in South Vietnam does not
now appear as remote as it once did.
For the Americans are committed in
their selfless purpose—it should always
be remembered that the United States
has not a single vested interest in Viet-
nam—as completely as it was at the time
of the Korean conflict. As important, the
United States has shown itself willing
to temper its conviction that the war
can be won in the air. Washington state-
ments recognise it cannot, and the
Pentagon has decided to commit six
additional ground combat battalions.
It may be assumed that many more
are ready for commitment: the West
Coast ports of the United States are
crammed with transports ready to uplift
fighting units at the instant of Presiden-
tial decision. This decision is dependent
upon the Vietcong itself. It the Vietcong
prosecutes its offensive—and there are
indications too, of relentlessness in the
pursuit of victory, for eight new North
Vietnamese battalions have been identi-
fied south of the 17th Parallel bringing
their strength to 65,000 fighting men—
to the American detriment, then the
American response may well precipitate
an all-out land war in Asia.
If this occurs then the 1000 Aus-
tralian fighting men now lying tucked
up with their Owens in rain-sodden slit
trenches at Bien. Hoa airfield may well
find themselves the advance guard of a
very much larger Australian military
force. Once committed, Australia may
well have to commit further battalions,
but where will they come from?
The reservoir of fighting men in Aus-
tralia is not deep. It may be that the
requirements of SEATO and ANZUS
will involve the Australians elsewhere.
There are dangerous rumbles from
Korea rumbles that sound like a
diversion from Vietnam—and the North-
Eastern provinces of Thailand are so
infected by Communism' that there is
more than a hint of insurgency.
If a diversionary war occurs in Korea,
or insurgency develops in Thailand, the
prospects are that the Australian
presence will be required again. But
one thing is certain in Vietnam: the Aus-
tralian public must be prepared to accept
heavy casualties.
The battle of Vietnam can be won,
but it cannot be won without a general
realisation that this is a major con-
frontation with Communism comparable
to Greece, Berlin, Korea and Malaya.
PM s’ conference
an while David Robertson reports
x from London that the Prime Minister,
Sir Robert Menzies, told a Press confer-
ence on the weekend that the Common-
wealth Mission led by the British Prime
Minister, Mr Wilson, was “a very good
SIR ROBERT MENZIES and DAME PATTIE with SIR ALBERT MARGAI and LADY MARGAI.


thing to have” and had some prospect
of success.
“We have ourselves always believed
that if there is to be a ceasefire it must
be all round and reciprocal. In other
words if there is to be a ceasefire on
the part of the Vietnamese, the South
Vietnamese, the Americans, the Aus-
tralians—whoever is there—then there
must be equally a ceasefire on the side
of the Vietcong, however one can get
that. Obviously this is essential.
“There must be a cessation of aggres-
sive conduct on the part of the North
Vietnamese. There must be a cessation
of maintenance of any kind.”
Terms of a settlement must contain:
• Full respect for the territorial
integrity and political independence
of Vietnam;
• A guarantee that South Vietnam
, will not be left to the mercy of
the Communist groups in the
Vietcong.
• An assurance in the long run of
an independent South Vietnam
living in peace, able to conduct
elections in an atmosphere of
peace, and able to establish a
democratically elected government.
• Some assurances that South Viet-
nam can enjoy stability and be left
alone able to live its own life.
In his private talks with Mr Wilson,
Sir Robert Menzies backed Mr Wilson
fully and outlined to him in detail
what Australia would expect to be the
principles of any settlement in Vietnam.
Sir Robert told the Press conference
that Ghana’s Dr Nkrumah advanced his
suggestion for the withdrawal of Aus-
tralian troops in the conference without
animosity. Dr Nkrumah put the sugges-
tion “ ‘with humility’, to use his words”.
Dr Nkrumah in the conference had
asked Australia and New Zealand to
make a “magnanimous gesture” by
withdrawing the Australians already in
Vietnam and delaying the despatch of
New Zealand’s artillery unit. He also
said an appeal should be made to the
United States to end its bombing attacks
in North Vietnam.
“You will not fail to notice these
are all proposals for the weakening ot
the American position of resistance.
There was no suggestion that the North
Vietnamese should refrain from support-
ing or supplying, no appeal to the Viet-
cong to refrain from infiltrating. What'
I said was that these two proposals were
designed to weaken the position of South
Vietnam and the forces defending South
Vietnam, and correspondingly to
strengthen the position of the enemy
without any concession being made by
the enemy at all, and that such a proposi-
tion I was not prepared to accept for
one minute. I therefore rejected it—and
quite rightly.”
POLITICS
A Scarecrow
ALP’s tatters and red patches
At the coining ALP Federal Con-
ference in Sydney, a scarecrow clothed
in tatters and red patches could well
be all that is fashioned by the Labor
Party’s 36 image-makers.
Further readings may be taken from
the meeting of the ALP Federal Execu-
tive in Canberra towards the end ol
July, but the State conferences in South
Australia, NSW and,' above all, Vic-
toria justify deep feelings of pessimism
that Labor will ever make for the public
eye the semblance of an alternative
Federal Government.
By BRIAN JOHNS
In a conference that otherwise was
as flat as last night's beer, the Federal
ALP secretary, Mr Cyril Wyndham,
spiritedly warned an unenthusiastic-look-
ing audience of delegates in Sydney’s
dowdy Town Hall of the chance that
voters would look to a new party unless
the ALP could put itself in order by
the 1966 Federal election.
At the time of speaking, Mr Wyndham
had attended the Victorian conference,
which a senior Federal colleague of his
has described “as frighteningly tyrannical
and despotic”. Soothsayers of the Press
have long —r too long, perhaps — been
predicting disaster for the ALP. But
the time is indeed now hard by. Mr
Wyndham must have had in mind the
most disgraceful performance by
“responsible” Labor men in our time:
the spectacle of a State ALP branch,
already notorious for despicable co-
operation with Communists in union
elections, seeking Federal respectability
for its actions by invoking Labor cliches
of “non-interference in union affairs”—
this from men of a cabal, which, flying
under the euphemistic title of “Trade
Union Defence Committee”, had ruth-
lessly gerrymandered an executive ticket
which had no place for a genuine Leftist
of the standing and integrity of Mr
“Bob” Holt, the former Victorian ALP
president; and where there had been
the sorry evidence of a Federal Labor
leader, Mr Arthur Cal well, delivering
himself up as the burnt offering, a
eaptive sacrifice, to a Labor rump
travelling under the guise of the Left.
Mr Calwell, who was to boast pathetic-
ally to NSW delegates that he had topped
the poll, has paid the price for so-called
Left bolstering of his leadership. It
now remains to be seen what price the
Labor Party has to pay for his atten-
dance as a Victorian delegate at the
coming Federal Conference. It has been
noted that his membership of this
delegation means that he has to support
Victoria’s case for unity tickets and flat
opposition to State Aid. But in these,
and other issues, the Victorians will be
able to remind conference delegates that
if they are against Victoria they will be
running the risk of publicly dumping
“Arthur”, Labor’s leader. Recent
months have shown, what old Labor
men have always known, that the ALP
has a deep and curious mystique about
its leader: in the final analysis he must
be tolerated (the major reason for the
long line of unsuccessful moves for a
“spill” of Parliamentary leadership
positions).
-NSW’s Labor men last week were
speculating openly that the Victorian
conference would mean a Federal
decision to intervene at last in Victoria
This would depend on the doubtful taste
for conflict by NSW and Tasmania
With “Bob” Holt gone, there is no
Victorian whom NSW and, for that
matter, delegates from all other States
except Western Australia will feel they
will be able to trust. There is the likeli-
hood that WA’s Mr F. E. Chamberlain,
who was at work in Victoria through
the young Victorian State secretary, Mi
W. Hartley, will throw down a further
gauntlet to his NSW adversaries by
standing for the office of Federal ALP
president. There is talk also that Vic-
toria will go further by attempting to
oust Mr Wyndham as Federal secretary,
another who is widely trusted.
If Victoria does attempt to follow
these extreme courses there is no telling
where the conflict may end. Certainly,
from it all, the battlelines seem clear.
Mr Calwell’s restive deputy, Mr Gough
Whitlam, now has publicly self-evident
issues of difference with his leader: unity
tickets, State Aid and the Wyndham
proposals for structural reform of the
ALP. On each of these subjects Mr
Whitlam has spoken unequivocally.
Although he is not an official delegate
to either the next Federal Executive
meeting or Federal Conference, he will
be able to attend. At both he will have
an opportunity to exercise leadership. If
he or his supporters fail there is only
the scarecrow.

' TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100 % from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

DROUGHT
Hard Road
Casting shadows
Economic expectations were severely
jolted last week following official fore-
casts that export income could well be
cut by a sixth or more next year, as a
result of the effects of drought on
primary production alone.
The seriousness of the rural situation,
especially in New South Wales and
Queensland, was underlined by a frank
assessment of the drought by the Depart-
ment of Trade. There was a strong
possibility that wool exports could be
halved and that no wheat would be
available for export. As well as these
two biggest export-earners, exports of
meat could also be out of the question.
Already local supplies are scarce, lamb
coming in from New Zealand and
Sydney butchers looking for jobs in
Melbourne.
Moreover, the seriousness of the
drought was casting shadows further
than next year because, without relief
in the next few weeks, the productive
capacity of vast rural areas would be
impaired indefinitely. It certainly seems
very surprising that, in projecting the
export tasks ahead of Australia in the
next 10 years, Sir John Allison, chair-
man of the Export Council, in a recent
address in Melbourne assumed a rising
performance for rural exports and failed
to mention drought at all!
With the full employment economy
going gaily on its course, the level of
national awareness of the disasters in
the rural sector and their eventual
national impact is barely noticeable. In
the highest places there is equivocation
about providing financial assistance for
relief measures. Steps to help conserve
the priceless assets of stock are largely
being left to the devices of the farmers
themselves.
With further adverse prospects loom-
ing for Australian exports to the three
biagest markets. Britain, Japan and the
US, as the balance of payments problems
of these countries intensify, the outlook
for capital inflow still clouded, and
defence expenditure crowding in on [he
scene, the broad economic picture looks
darker than for many years. Put bluntly,
it will be very difficult to maintain full
employment with the shrinking of avail-
able resources. If the attempt is made
to sustain or even improve on current
levels of economic activity in face of
the prospective lower level of resources,
we can expect a resurgence of latent
inflationary pressures.
In these circumstances the Federal
Government has a heavy obligation to


cut back expenditure in all avenues—
apart from defence. But instead, we
learn from the Treasurer, Mr H. E. Holt,
that next year Federal outlays are to rise
by £250 million, of which only £9O
million will be for defence. Most of this
will be raised by increasing taxation,
which in these conditions would have
an added inflationary effect. If the
Arbitration Commission increases the
basic wage again the fat will really be in
the fire.
PRESS
Troubles for
Mr Murdoch
Money and regulations
The newspaper empire of Mr Rupert
Murdoch suffered contraction pains at
home and abroad last week. The most
severe pain was in Canberra where Mr
Murdoch carried out a retrenchment
exercise among the staff of his national
daily, “The Australian”. The pain was
milder abroad merely protests at the
Murdoch invasion of the New Zealand
Press.
More than 14 journalists, along with
a number of printing staff, are reported
to have been retrenched (or transferred
to other Murdoch outposts) in Canberra.
Flashpoint for the exercise was the
closing down of the Canberra edition,
known in the capital as '“the little
Digger”. “Australian” executives are
reported as saying that the retrenchments
will save £5OOO a week. In a review of
the situation some months ago losses at
this stage were expected to be £lO,OOO
a week.
Among the fatalities' in last week’s
exercise were “The Australian’s” literary
editor, Dr R. F. Brissendon, and his
panel of reviewers, who were largely re-
sponsible for the magazine pages of the
Saturday edition. Another notable move
was the transfer of the English journalist,
Mr Sol Chandler (one-time “Peter Bren-
nan” columnist in “The Australian”), to
Murdoch's Melbourne “Truth”.
In newspaper circles —usually the least
reliable of all—there is talk of a con-
ference at “The Australian” a fortnight
ago at which Mr Murdoch announced
his intention to make “The Australian”
an evening daily in Canberra and go
national only on Sunday. In this tactic
Murdoch’s ailing “Sunday Mirror” was
to be killed and a morganatic marriage
celebrated between it and “The Aus-
tralian’s” national Sunday. It is reported
that his editorial executives prevailed on
Mr Murdoch at the Canberra conference
to grant “The Australian” a reprieve.
-Now the present managing editor, Mr
Walter Kommer, and Mr Murdoch are
preparing to embark on a two-man
advertising drive in an attempt to make
the reprieve a full pardon.
Meanwhile, Mr Murdoch’s financial
interest in the New Zealand metropolitan
daily, “The Dominion”, has been chal-
lenged by the Opposition in the New'
Zealand House of Representatives.
Attorney-General Ralph Hanan denied
last week that “The Dominion” was
owned by an “overseas person” within
the meaning of the Overseas Takeover
Regulations, 1964. And at the same
time he denied that the Government
planned legal proceedings against the
Wellington Publishing Company—pub-
lishers of “The Dominion” for an
alleged regulations’ breach. He did say,
however, that the legal advisers of the
Reserve Bank had been asked to consider
the whole question.
RUPERT MURDOCH
A notice of motion from another
Labor member, Mr W. W. Freer, said:
“In view of direct action which the
Prime Minister took to prevent an
independent English company from pur-
chasing ‘The Dominion’, while agree-
ing to a substantial interest being
acquired by an Australian newspaper
group,, the House calls on the Govern-
ment to clarify its position in relation to
the development of monopolistic control
of New Zealand newspapers.”
Since the publication of the first issue
of the “Sunday Times”—with high penal
weekend wages, distribution costs and a
radio advertising campaign—other news-
paper publishers have taken a closer look
at the Sunday paper proposition.
is as yet no sign of the two Auckland
dailies, the "New Zealand Herald” and
the “Auckland Star”, producing a Sun-
day. In fact, indications are they may
beef up their Saturday’s issue some-
thing the “Star” did last weekend.
DEVELOPMENT
Tuna Wake
A snag for a new industry
Five years ago Tasmania seemed t®
be on the threshold of a tuna bonanza.
Enthusiastic sportsmen surveying game-
fish reported finding abundant bluefin
tuna. A Tuna Club was formed in
October, 1960, and doubled its member-
ship in two months.
Within weeks these sportsmen found
evidence that Japanese commercial tuna
catchers were operating outside territorial
waters on the East Coast. The amateurs
hailed this as a confirmation of their
optimistic estimates and the State Gov-
ernment followed up by announcing it
would supply two of its Fisheries’ patrol
boats for a survey, when CSIRO experts
became available. Two years passed while
the Government sought Commonwealth
assistance. It considerably increased pres-
sure in mid-1963 when Japanese tuna
boats began to call at Hobart. Crews
disclosed that a dozen 250-ton vessels
and a mother ship were successfully
operating off south and south-east Tas-
mania.
The visitors agreed that tuna was
there but warned that the Japanese ves-
sels were extremely expensive, and that
most of the fish caught were of variety
eaten raw in Japan and unsuitable for
canning. Last June the Government
announced it still wanted subsidy from
the Commonwealth to investigate the
“terrific” potential of a tuna-canning
industry. In December the Federal
Minister for Primary Industry. Mr Ader-
mann, said the Commonwealth and State
would jointly sponsor a £50,000 search
for commercial tuna off Tasmania. Now
it is clear that only half that sum was
necessary to disprove all the optimistic
estimates.
After four months’ work the survey
has been suspended until summer. Two
first-class boats and a chartered spotter
aircraft have proved one thing—there is
insufficient bluefin available to justify a
Tasmanian industry.

Learning to Sit
“More heat than light ”
The American university style of
public discussion on Vietnam, the “teach-
in”, came to Sydney University last week
when a meeting of 80 students and staff
elected “The Sydney University Staff-
Student Committee on Vietnam”.
The two present concerns of the com-
mittee are what form the “teach-ins”
should take and whom to invite as par-
ticipants other than academics and


Urgent Need
\
for Metal Products
Exports —■
Executives of companies manufacturing
metal products will carry a serious respon-
sibility in 1965-66.
Export income, always vital to Australia,
will be more important than ever to help
offset the effects of the British budget and
of President Johnson’s measures to reduce
dollar outflows.
And at a time when exports will be so
important, severe drought and lower wool
prices will have reduced the value of
primary exports.
Australian manufacturing industry must
carry a heavier share of the load. This can
be done only by breaking into new overseas
markets.
If your business is metal manufactures,
Lincoln Electric may be able to help you.
Your success overseas will depend on the
cost of your production; and Lincoln’s
business is to help its customers use welding
with maximum efficiency.
As Australias largest manufacturer of arc
welding machines and electrodes, we believe
you should be having the benefit of this
kind of help. It is included in the price of
welding equipment and supplies. Why not
take advantage of it?

students. Some obvious names already
under consideration—Morris West and
Denis Warner.
Some of the more publicised meetings
of this type at American universities
have lasted for 24 hours with critics
claiming they generate “more heat than
light” on Vietnam. But Washington has
paid at least some attention to them:
last week a former US ambassador in
Saigon spoke at the first “teach-in” to
cross the Atlantic, held at Oxford.
Across the Pacific, the first “teach-in”
was the idea of second-year Arts student
Paddy Dawson, a member of the ALP
Club, and chairman of the committee.
The nine-member committee covers the
political spectrum from peace congress
stalwart Associate Professor E. Wheel-
wright to the representative from the
Liberal Club, Simon West. Other staff
members are Dr Peter King, Lecturer
in Government, and Professor S. E.
Wright (Pharmacy) who was reported
as saying that the “teach-ins” were based
on Quaker meetings where anyone who
felt he could contribute was allowed to
speak. Other student members on the
committee include two from the Fabian
Society and one from the Labor Club.
The local “teach-ins” may, for a start
anyhow, be less ambitious than the
American marathons, limiting themselves
to afternoon or evening meetings. The
aim is to promote “informed discussion”
about the Vietnam war.
A lesser concern with such aims
seemed to mark the plans of the Univer-
sity Socialist Club which planned to
show Vietcong propaganda films at
lunchtime this week. But at the weekend
Mr Rex Rickard, secretary of the Milk
and Ice Carters’ Union, who brought
the films back from a visit to North
Vietnam, and who was to be there to
answer questions, withdrew the films.
The club’s president, Ann Qurthoys,
admitted that she was a “bit vague”
about the contents of the films. Although
the club had thought of getting US or
South Vietnamese films, it did not know
how to obtain them.

months. There has also been a rash of
individual rape cases.
One of the worst involved a girl who
was taken to a rubbish dump, which
was littered with broken glass, by a
youth. Before attacking the girl, the
youth removed her shoes so that she
could not run away. The Queensland
Criminal Code at present provides for
whipping of certain offenders, but it can-
not be ordered for offenders sent to gaol
for more than two years. And, of course,
the worst offenders get the longest terms
... so they have no chance of being
whipped.
Legal authorities told The Bulletin
last week that whipping had not been
ordered by a Queensland court for 30
years. They said, however, that judges
had the power to fix the number of
strokes to be given and the type of
instrument to be used. Queensland law
provides for the use of four types of
whipping instrument a birch rod, a
cane, a leather strap, and a cat-o’-nine-
tails.
The “cat” cannot be used on an offen-
der under 16 years. For offenders in
this age bracket a whipping is limited
to 16 strokes one apparently for each
year of their age. Up to three whippings
of offenders over 16 can be ordered by
a judge. But the number of strokes for
each whipping must not exceed 50. And,
as well, a whipping must be carried out
within six months of the offender being
convicted.
By law, whipping is provided for
several types of sex offences—including
attempted carnal knowledge of a girl
und r ten years, unlawfully and inde-
cently treating a girl under 12, unlawful
carnal knowledge of a girl under 12,
and attempting carnal knowledge of a
girl under 12.

Contravening the Act
Twelve expelled and suspended officers
of the SA branch of the AWU have
won the first round of their fight with
the union’s Federal Executive for re-
instatement.
In what is a damaging blow to Federal
AWU secretary Mr Tom Dougherty, the
Full Bench of the Commonwealth Indus-
trial Court in Adelaide found that the
rules under which the officers were
expelled or suspended from their elected
positions contravened Section 140 of the
Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The
rules were challenged in the court by
expelled vice-president J. D. Wright.
Release of the judgment came as a sur-
prise; it was not expected until after this
week’s hearing in Adelaide of several
rules nisi claiming that the expelled and
suspended members were wrongfully
dismissed.
The finding strengthens the claim by
the SA Left-wingers that their expulsions
and suspensions after an enquiry in
Adelaide were for personal reasons,
stemming from the Dougherty-Clyde
Cameron conflict. The reinstatement of
the officers now appears certain, giving
the Left wing control of the SA branch
and heightened the Left and Right
wing power struggle in the AWU.
Mr Don Cameron, secretary - eleci
before his expulsion by the Federal
Executive, said the court’s decision in
Mr Wright's challenge marked an import-
ant milestone towards democratic control
of trade unions. “The decision is prob-
ably one of the most important made
because it firmly protects the rights of
some 150,000 AWU members against
any attempt by the union's Federal
Executive to supersede elected branch
officials for long periods without a
ballot,” he said.

RELIGION
Bush Priests
Struggling in impecunity
The Anglican Church’s eight bush dio-
ceses sprawling over 100,000 square
miles and five-sixths of the continent
have a champion in North Queensland’s
highly articulate Bishop, the Rt Rev. lan
Shevill. In an impassioned “Charge” to
his synod in Townsville, Bishop Shevill
has declared that “many a bush diocese
is condemned to a condition of strangling
impecunity”.
The eight bush dioceses North
Queensland, Rockhampton, Carpentaria,
Bathurst, Riverina, Willochra, Kalgoorlie
and North-West Australia “because
they happen to be in Australia, they are
left to struggle on as best they can with
no assistance from the National Church
. . . and this, no other part of the world
can understand”.
Bishop Shevill drew a detailed picture
of the plight of the bush dioceses as
against their city counterparts. He point-
ed out that bush clergy received stipends
generally considerably lower than those
paid in the cities. Isolation and lack of
facilities made the maintenance of staff
a constant problem “and although these
dioceses serve the areas which produce
the wealth of Australia, this wealth is
controlled by those who live in'" the
cities.” Drawing from a survey he item-
ised bush diocesan budgets of £2400,
£3500 and £1315.
“We discover that almost a million
pounds is required for capital and en-
dowment needs and that 60 more priests
are needed now. We read of bishops
embarrassed by thoughts of retirement
because no provision has been made, of
a diocese without any cathedral, of a
diocesan bishop with no house, of dio-
cesan administration with little more
than the help of a junior typist.”
Bishop Shevill singled out for criti-
cism the Australian Anglican Primate’s
Committee on Church Resources, estab-
lished as a result of the Anglican 1963
Congress in Toronto, Canada, which
Bishop Shevill said “lit new beacons of
hope for the bush bishops of Australia”.
However, an Anglican spokesman
pointed out in Sydney last week that
Bishop Shevill’s criticism was a day
late. The committee at a meeting in Syd-
ney had decided to recommend to the
next General Synod in April that the
position of Missionary Dioceses in re-
mote areas be defined. The 10-man com-
mittee— mainly composed of represen-
tatives of city dioceses because “Arch-
bishop Gough has no travel account” for
the purpose—also decided that projects
in remote areas should be published in a
world directory of Anglican needs as a
means of encouraging assistance.


AROUND MELBOURNE
No Biz Like Snow Biz
“Can’t find a mountain for the Tramways Board”
Onow biz in Victoria, although it
has much handier ski runs to
the big city, has never prospered like
snow biz in NSW. The difference was
this: NSW handed over the snowfields
to private enterprise. Look at our
situation. Mt Buller is under the
control of the Forestry Department,
Mt Hotham is under the Lands De-
partment, Falls Creek is with the State
Electricity Commission and you might
say that Mt Buffalo is really under
the wing of the Victorian Railways.
As one senior skier said bitterly last
week: “Isn’t it a shame that we can’t
find a mountain for the Tramways
Board?”
Of course, Mt Buller, 5900 feet,
160-odd miles from Melbourne,
always has been the Blackpool, the
St Kilda beach of ski-ing, so to speak.
For years it has suffered without
electricity, indifferent roads and a
totally inadequate water supply. In
recent years, however, it has received
the official blessing and at last it is
beginning to look like a real resort.
In 1955 Mt Buller had two rope tows
and 30 lodges. This year there are
nine ski lifts, 150 lodges, over 100
flats, three commercial chalets, an
hotel, shops and licensed restaurants.
Vlfhat’s more, the opening of the ski
"" season over Queen’s Birthday
weekend has developed into one of the
grand eye-reddening social events of
the year. All the newspapers sent
their snow writers, their special writers
and a whole flurry of social writers.
On the Saturday night there was the
traditional firing of rockets and the
letting off of crackers. The mountain
shook with parties. One of the more
notable parties took place at the
Nomad Lodge. It had been built only
over the previous three months and
Saturday night was the opening. They
did something disturbingly new for
the mountain. Dress was formal, so
they had over 100 guests all in black
tie, or long evening dress. A dinner
jacket always looks nice when you’ve
brought it up the mountain in a ruck-
sack. They had two 18-gallon kegs
of beer and a keg of wine. The party
went all night. Then later, as the sun
came up, the gentlemen in their
dinner jackets went ski-ing.
But the grand party was at
Kooroora Chalet. It was the official
opening of the new Kooroora exten-
sions. For one thing there is now
a heated swimming pool. It is out
in the open and surrounded by a glass
screen. The idea is that, immediately
after ski-ing, one tears off one’s
clothes and leaps into the pool, heated
to a delicious sauna-like temperature
of 90 degrees. Last week several
models were photographed standing
in the pool when the temperature was
almost zero. This, perhaps, was one
of the most noble sacrifices ever on
behalf of publicity. Your correspon-
dent went in when the temperature
was 75 and the pool had been heated
for four days. Actually, the best place
to plunge was the toddlers’ pool.
The best place to get around at
7 p.m. was inside Kooroora, along
with 150 others at the party provided
by Ernest and Judy Forras. Ernest
Forras, a Hungarian, is one of the
men who have made Mt Buller.
Ernest had a German who slaved all
night. He turned on turkey, chicken,
roast sucking pig, great German cakes
deliciously decorated with grapes,
chocolate and cream. There was a
model, too, of Kooroora made of
chocolate and cream.
At 8.30 p.m. the Minister for
Forests and Housing, Lindsay Thomp-
son, opened the Bull’s Blood Bar.
Designed by Peter Mclntyre in the
Australian Tyrol manner, there was
massive use of timber in the tables,
the benches, and the great overhead
beams. Naturally we all had to drink
the specialty of the house Hun-
garian Bull’s Blood. This is Hungary's
best wine from Eger, near Budapest,
called Egri Bikaver, and if you buy
it in Melbourne it costs 255. a bottle.
It is mellow, fruity, and, according to
Ernest Forras, does wonderful things
to a man’s virility.
Apart from the Bull’s Blood Bar we
also saw the opening of three blocks
of self-contained apartments, each
with heating, kitchen range, bunk
room and drying room. Ernest Forras
has named them after famous Buller
ski runs like Bourke Street, Shaky
Knees, Federation, Summit, Bull Run
and Fanny’s Finish.
HPhe other 1 place which has come
on is the Abominable. You may
remember back in the summer
months our telling you about the Arab
Coffee Lounge at Lome, a sort of
young people’s surfie shrine, where
you lie on the floor and drink strong
coffee. The Smith brothers, who
started the Arab nine years ago, now
have the Abominable. It has two
hexagonal rooms, sunk, so that in
heavy snow the whole place is
covered. As you enter there is the
splendid atmosphere and typical light-
ing of a dungeon. Over the week-end
the trade was unbelievable; they
averaging 500 lunches daily and 200
dinners. With dancing and shaking
it kept going until 2 a.m. The place,
designed like an iglQO, rarely needs
heating. Actually, with so many
bodies, they might have to put in a
cooling unit this winter.
It was estimated that nigh on 6000
people were sleeping on the mountain.
Sunday was the worst day. The day
trippers came in. The cars, over 2000
of them, were parked five miles down
the mountain. People were trying to
get up, people were trying to get
down. The police turned away 700
cars and three went over the side.
By late afternoon, with the snow
melting under a near-summer sun,
Bourke Street ski run had become
quite terrifying with mug skiers
coming in all directions. Bourke
Street was like Bourke Street outside
Myers on Christmas Eve.
The ski rescue team did a superb
job. Now, for the first time, they are
really properly equipped. They have
a new ambulance with two-way radio
contact throughout the north-east,
oxygen equipment, winch . gear for
handling patients up precipices, and
a mountain hospital lodge with
quarters for doctor and nurse is
approaching completion.
There were hundreds of minor
abrasions to be treated during the
weekend, but they averaged only five
serious jobs daily. The really splendid
fracture season will come later when
the snow is deep and the skis stick in.
The Buller average is 150 bone breaks
a season and the record for one day
is 21. Down at the Mansfield Hospital
sometimes they don’t show a skier’s
enthusiasm for the coming of snow.

Two Faces of External Affairs
1. Holden-style Diplomats
“They even advertise for recruits ”
By ANTHONY CAYE BROWN
At 0400 on October 28, 1964, a
party of 50 heavily armed and
well-trained Indonesian comman-
dos slipped through the Allied naval
screen in the Straits of Malacca aboard
praus and landed 35 miles south of
Malacca, close to Terendak Camp, base
of the 28th Commonwealth Infantry
Brigade Group. At the camp on stand-by
were two companies of the Third Bat-
talion Royal Australian Rifles. By 0600
the companies—together with an Aus-
tralian battery of 105 mm howitzers—
were moving into the landing zone to
engage the commandos at the express
orders of the Australian High Com-
missioner to Malaysia. The order was
given according to a Canberra-approved
contingency plan, permitting Australian
troops to be used in combat against
Indonesians for the first time.
As artillery pounded the tree tops of
the rain forest—the Indonesians were
sniping down at the advancing infantry
a teleprinter behind two-inch thick
steel doors with combination locks in
the Department of I External Affairs in
Canberra started to rap out a top
secret emergency code message at 66.6
words a minute. It was a communication
for the Minister for External Affairs, Paul
Hasluck, from the High Commissioner,
T. Critchley. And the teleprinter con-
tinued to patter out its code throughout
the day as the Australians used up
12,000 rounds of ammunition in an eye-
ball to eyeball engagement in chest-high
mangrove swamp.
Throughout the next night—as rem-
nants of the Indonesians continued the
firefight as they lay like leopards on the
tree limbs —Critchley passed messages to
the cipher clerks for encoding in the
High Commission building on Ampang
Road, Kuala Lumpur, continuing the
process of informing his Government,
which in turn passed the messages on
to Mr Keith Shann, Australian Ambas-
sador to Djakarta, where another con-
tingency plan existed for employment
should the Indonesian Government use
the firefight to -take physical or diplo-
matic sanctions against Australia or its
property in Indonesia.
At twilight on the 30th the last Indo-
nesians surrendered and the troops re-
turned to base, rumbling through the
rubber plantations in high spirits. At
0900 the next morning a private in-
formant telephoned the High Com-
missioner to describe the action in un-
military language and, together with the
battalion commanders and intelligence
reports, he prepared a cable for Canberra,
where it was processed in “EA” for on-
ward transmission to the Australian rep-
resentative at the United Nations on
Manhattan Island. There the report was
filed, ready for use should support be
requested by the Malaysian Government
in a formal protest.
This was Australian diplomacy at
work in an extreme emergency. It was
an integrated diplomatic-military action,
the employment of one of the oldest
crafts in the world. Yet the Australian
diplomatic service is only 20 years old.
Today “EA” lies across steel-grey Lake
Burley Griffin, in a sandy building eight
storeys high. Here Australia’s public
and secret diplomacies are hammered
out for execution by a foreign service
which in 1939 had only three men
abroad but which today has 46 diplo-
matic missions overseas and a staff of
nearly 1000 men and women.
EA is one of the world's most
egalitarian foreign services. The British
tend to purr to conferences in the white-
wall splendor of the Rolls, the Americans
cosseted in the blue-glass privacy of
Imperials or Cadillacs, the Russians in
the early-Detroit elegance of Zis and
Zims, the French in black waxed Citroens
but the Australians prefer the
bourgeois facelessness of the Holden,
with an occasional Princess in the stables.
EA permits no plumage, gold braid or
swords. Its language is carefully mani-
cured Australian in a world long
dominated by French or the mono-
syllables of Oxford and Cambridge. The
niceties of diplomatic intercourse are
preserved without any of the Ruritanian
of the European courts. Outside EA is
none of that flag-fluttering pomp asso-
ciated with men who control the destinies
of the world only a comparatively
down-at-heel assembly of cars while
inside, the four “Desks” which sit in vigil
upon Asia, America, Europe, Africa are
cluttered by men in shirt-sleeve order.
There is, of course, no diplomatic

proposition
for me”
If you’re self-employed, you get a
BUSINESS
from the Self-Employed Persons Retirement Fund
recommended by the Bank of New South Wales.
Most self-employed people have to make
special provision for retirement. The prob-
lem is “How best to do it?”
The Self-Employed Persons Retirement
Fund offers you a good business proposi-
tion.
Here’s why—
Taxation concessions.

tax-free and fully re-invested.
• Benefit which is paid as a lump sum is
not taxable. (Maximum benefit per-
mitted, now £40,000.)
fou can vary your contributions. You
don’t have to commit yourself to fixed con-
tributions. You may pay in any amount
at any time ... up to £4OO a year to the
age of 40; £BOO a year between the ages of
40 and 55; and £1,200 a year from age 55
to retirement.
Full benefit on retirement. After deduc-

uniform. One was proposed; it was to
have green lightweight trousers, white
monkey jacket with a gold wattle motif
on the lapels. But the design got no
further than a court-dress tailor’s tablet.
EA is totally without that antiseptic
intensity of the State Department; with-
out that hooded, marbled, intricate
demeanor of the Soviet diplomatist on
the steps of the Soviet Foreign Ministry;
without the Gallic mystery of the high
French Foreign man leaving the Quai
d’Orsay; there is a touch, but only a
touch, of the studied aristocratic English,
a hint of that British competence, earnest-
ness. On the whole, one suspects that
most of EA are at home at DJs. Light-
weight checks, lovats, tweeds, with waist-
coats and umbrellas and suede shoes are
very much in at EA, which has an aura
about it of a good conservative club.
[Like all such clubs, EA has its witti-
cisms. One is the classic diplomat reply
hanging on one EA wall —of the
Cossack leaders to a demand for
surrender from the Turkish Sultan
Mahomet III: “You, Sultan, Turkish
devil and secretary of Lucifer himself!
How in Hell can you call yourself a
warrior when you can’t even ... an
ass’s . . . let the devil take you away
and gobble up your army. You son-
of-a-bitch, you have no right to be the
guardian of Christian sons; we aren’t
afraid of your army. We will lick you
on land and sea, you hostile son-of-a-
bitch. Go . . . your mother. You
Alexandrian goatherd, you Babylonian
cook, you Macedonian wagonmaker,
Jerusalem’s traitor, Kamchatka cat,
Podolian villain, swindler of the world,
evildoer of the underworld. Kiss our . . .
(signed) Ivan Sirko.”]
EA is so egalitarian that it advertises
for recruits, unheard of in Europe where
the recruitment process appears to con-
centrate amongst the haut monde, some-
times has the smell of nepotism about it
and, in Britain at least, seems to be the
prerogative of nice-mannered and willowy
scholars.
Secrecy is implicit in diplomacy and
all EA is watched over by official eyes.
Cadets and diplomats are subjected to
confidential reports in which the subject’s
entire manner of life is assessed to weed
out men with unsuspected weaknesses,
the man who is cracking up—crack-ups
have occurred, particularly through
heavy drinking —or compromising: the
diplomat is taught to adhere strictly to
Governmental policies and to avoid
unnecessary contacts with potentially
hostile governments. If EA appears
leisurely, it is also the machine for
gathering important and special intelli-
gence, the life-blood of decision-making.
It is, therefore, as much a matter of
the national interest to ensure the diplo-

mat is not compromising, for Russian
and Chinese agents have made and con-
tinue to make efforts to penetrate EA.
Sensitive areas in the department —such
as the Communication Centre and the
Code Room —are guarded by grey, two-
inch thick steel doors mounted with
burglar alarms and combination locks.
Nothing is overlooked —so far as is
known in the effort to preserve
security: not even waste paper. There is
a system of “classified” waste and “un-
classified” waste; “classified” waste goes
into red bins, “unclassified” into grey
bins. The red material conference
notes, the tops of note pads (a skilled
agent can learn much by the impression
left on the under copy), carbons, even
doodlings at secret conferences —is col-
lected each night by a man, who is
himself security-cleared, and then cere-
moniously and carefully shredded. There
are steel grilles on the windows and bells
on. the doors.
Even a candidate’s wife is cleared
to ensure that marital disturbances do
not impair the diplomat’s efficiency or
that her private behavior does not pose
a security risk. Foreign marriages and
miscegenation is not actively dis-
couraged by the department, but official
eyes tend to regard such unions with
caution. And all diplomatic bags have
six steel ring holes in their bottoms: to
ensure that if a diplomat is forced to
throw his bag into the sea, it sinks.
With the birth of Australian diplomacy,
and the substitution of diplomacy for
power dictated by Australia’s population
problems, came also a State and public
insistence that foreign policy should never
be secret unless the publication of such
policy ran counter to the national interest.
I do not believe Australia is party to a
single secret treaty. It would also be
wrong to assume that the Australian
diplomat is little more than a clerk on
the end of a telephone executing the
Plimsoll Line, the Hasluckian Theory. He
has a certain authority in the mechanics
of decision-making.
For journalists, perhaps, the average
Australian diplomat has a spinsterish
quality; a tight-lipped and basically un-
friendly relationship does exist between
two professions which so closely resemble
each other. But there are notable excep-
tions: the brilliance of intelligence of
ambassadorial briefings to Pressmen by
South-East Asian ambassadors has made
their British counterparts seem like junior
reporters in the business.
The Australian Foreign Service has
now emerged with an identity of its own.
If some ambassadors are proving inade-
quate to their posts this is only because
of the absence of the great traditions of
diplomacy. Time will correct this. In dis-
cussing their effectiveness Stalin’s remark
about the Pope (“The Pope? How many
Divisions has he got?”) comes to mind.
The Australians have few. Their gun-
boats do not bear down on foreign hori-
zons. For this reason, perhaps, the Aus-
tralian Foreign Service has a special
effectiveness: it is not tainted with the
aura of “Perfide Albion” of the British.
That clean, clear-eyed, sun-kissed ap-
pearance that so many Australian diplo-
mats give has an appeal which is valuable
to Asian and black governments —white
diplomacy without white conspiracy.
(The Australian diplomat can be as good
at conspiracy as anyone else.) And he
is also extremely good at golf-course
diplomacy. Tom Critchley, High Com-
missioner to Malaysia, is the arch-
practitioner of bettering Australian
interests on the fairway.

Ampol is Australian owned. Ampol earnings go back to Aus-
tralians and into Australian development. This is spectacularly
demonstrated by Ampol’s decision to build the first major
Australian-owned petrol refinery near Brisbane at a cost of £2l
million . . . the whole project being backed entirely by Aus-
tralian finance.
Ampol earnings are also being used to further the search for oil.
So many Australian interests are sponsored by Ampol—sport,
education, industry, art and science. You, too,
can help build a more prosperous Aus-
tralia, by buying Ampol products.

Leading officials of the Department of External Affairs.
By F. O. CARLTON BROWN
At the beginning of each year the
ranks of the Australian foreign
service are expanded by the ad-
dition of about ten young people who
have been selected as External Affairs
Officers Grade I. This is the lowest of
the seven grades of the Australian dip-
lomatic service. On admission to the
department, however, new entrants are
told that during their careers they should
not regard themselves as diplomats but
as public servants. Australia has no
counterpart to the British Foreign Ser-
vice Act which sets the British Foreign
Office apart from the rest of the Civil
Service. Instead, Australia’s representa-
tives overseas are subject to the opera-
tion of the Public Service Act. New
recruits to Australia’s foreign service are
thus advised not to regard themselves as
qualitatively different from other public
servants. This attempt to prevent the
emergence of differences between the
foreign service and other members of
the public service is not always com-
pletely successful, and there can be re-
sentments (usually latent) between mem-
bers of the two groups. Despite this,
the Australian foreign service could be
regarded as a good deal more egalitarian
in outlook than many of its counterparts
overseas.
Although qualifications for admission
to the Australian diplomatic service
differ appreciably from those governing
entry to other branches of the public
service, the new recruit, once accustomed
to regarding himself as not being a mem-
ber of a class apart, may feel more at
ease in discussion with senior members
of other departments than with senior
members of his own. Most of the new
recruits come straight from the univer-
sity and the more independent-minded
of them may find it difficult to accept
the hierarchical system of the public
service. Their colleagues about three
grades up the scale are usually con-
sidered quite approachable, but a certain
aura of aloofness tends to surround the
higher circles. Thus, while egalitarianism
within the public service as a whole is
encouraged,, this applies to the new
entrant’s relations with his departmental
colleagues only within certain limits.
Admission to the Australian diplomatic
service takes place annually after a
lengthy series of interviews, intelligence
tests and tests in aptitude for analysing
problems of foreign policy and, where
possible, for suggesting possible further
developments in these. Applicants who
manage to be included on the “short
list” prior to final selection are taken
to Canberra for two or three days each
August or September for an intensive
array of tests designed to indicate their
suitability as operators in the traditional
arenas for diplomatic horse - trading:
chancery, conference and cocktail party.
Faithful repetition of the known Govern-
ment line on an issue is by no means
an automatic guarantee of selection and,
in practice, applicants may be critical of
established policy even on such funda-
mentals as White Australia or non-
recognition of Peking. Much will depend,
however, on the manner in which these
criticisms are presented, but once he is
selected a new recruit might be surprised
at the volume of disagreement with
certain facets of Government policy ex-
pressed privately by members of the
department. For example, many Aus-
tralian diplomats would undoubtedly find
their task easier were it not for the
interest shown in Afro-Asian countries in
Australian policies on such issues as
immigration or South Africa. In short,
in their personal attitudes on political
questions the junior members of the
department are, on the whole, no more
Left-wing or Right-wing than their
educated contemporaries outside it.
It is less and less valid nowadays to
believe that admission to the diplomatic
service is a matter of having contacts
or wearing the right old school tie. Ad-
mittedly, some schools are heavily rep-
resented in it: Geelong Grammar, for
example, has produced almost one-eighth
of the members of the service, of whom
one in four has reached ambassadorial
rank, while others have served as per-
manent heads of mission at a level
slightly below this. Most of these Corio
alumni were, however, appointed prior
to the mid-'fifties.
In fact, if there is any one source
from which junior diplomats are re-
cruited it is Sydney University, especially,
in recent years, from its History school.
For the past few years now, usually at
least half of each annual intake has con-
sisted of Sydney graduates, with Aus-
tralia's other nine universities providing
the balance. Some States, notably
Queensland until very recently, and, to
a latter extent, Tasmania, produce com-
paratively few members of the service.
Recruits are normally drawn from
graduates in Arts, Law, Economics or
Science, although there is presently no
reason against selecting them from other
fields.
Whether graduates from these other
fields or, indeed, from the traditional
four faculties would choose to join the
service would depend on their willing-

which they have been trained. Allowing
for slight variations related to whether
a recruit has an honors or post-graduate
degree, the commencing salary is of the
order of £l5OO, while a female recruit
would get £2OO less than this. (Most of
the more recent intakes have included
one or, at the most, two young women.)
Most junior members of the service con-
sider that they are inadequately paid, and
there is quite some resentment at the
fact that the Department of Trade can
offer more attractive salaries to recruits
to its Trade Commissioner service.
One noticeable consequence of the
level of salaries offered has been a
decline in the overall standards of
entrance qualification. Until two or three
years ago, an honors degree was virtually
an essential pre-requisite for selection.
Since the salaries of External Affairs
officers do not always compare favor-
ably with those offered in alternative
careers, the department has had to relax
its standards and admit more graduates
who do not possess honors degrees.
The highest salary level that any mem-
ber can hope to achieve within the de-
partment is that of secretary (permanent
head) which is currently of the order
of £7300 per annum. He would be un-
likely to reach this position much
before the age of 50. Failing this, the
highest salary he could hope to achieve
would be that of ambassador—roughly
£5OOO per annum plus overseas allow-
ances. Appointment to ambassadorial
level rarely takes place before a member
is in his mid-forties. The first promotion
which a new recruit can expect usually
takes place after about five years’ service
'and raises his salary-to a little over
£2OOO per annum.
The new recruit spends his first 12
months in training, and generally serves
for about another year in Canberra
before he can expect a posting overseas
as third secretary to an Australian
diplomatic mission. The training pro-
vided within the department is supple-
mented by more at the Australian
National University. If a recruit has no
language qualification prior to joining
he will be enrolled in a first-year
language course at the university, with
the department choosing the languages.
Should he have a background in
languages, on the other hand, he will take
a second-year university course in
politics, dealing with American and
Soviet politics or, less frequently, inter-
national relations. Training in Australian
politics is not provided, the individual
being left to acquire his own knowledge
of this privately.
One consequence of this is the com-
parative ignorance of Australian politics
shown by some members of the service,


particularly those Australians recruited
from overseas, some of whom have spent
truly negligible periods of their life-
times in Australia prior to joining. Thus,
one third secretary was posted to an
Asian country believing that Harold
Holt was leader of the DLP, while an-
other had never heard of Stanley Kor-
man.
Since one of the main functions of a
third secretary in an Australian mission
consists in economic reporting, a course
in the elements of economics is pro-
vided within the department, in which all
recruits must pass an examination during
their first year. Similarly, they are ex-
pected to pass a comparable test at the
conclusion of a course on basic inter-
national law. Training for representation
at international conferences is also con-
sidered by the department to be an im-
portant element in the first year pro-
gramme, and mock conference situations
are created as practical exercises in this.
The department expects that all of its
diplomatic officers should have some
knowledge of at least one foreign
language. While some members at all
levels simply do not have much aptitude
for languages and therefore have only a
rudimentary knowledge of one, others
may display pentecostal gifts and speak
as many as five, or more, with reasonable
ability and sometimes considerable
fluency. French is by far the most widely
“known” language, with other Romance
languages following it. Of the Asian
languages, Indonesian is the most widely
known (the Australian Embassy in
Djakarta is our second largest, after
Washington) with 27 officers having a
basic knowledge of it, another 18 possess-
ing a good working knowledge and four
who speak it fluently. Ten members of
this group are currently posted in Indo-
nesia or Malaysia. In recent years there
has been increased emphasis on training
in Indonesian and, to a slightly lesser
extent, in other Asian languages. After
Indonesian, Japanese is the second most
widely known, with 13 officers possess-
ing a basic knowledge, five with an
adequate working knowledge, four with
fluency and one capable of speaking it as
well as an ordinary Japanese. There
are slightly fewer with training in
Chinese, although there would be quite
enough suitably qualified officers to staff
an embassy of reasonable dimensions
and even enough to replace some of
them. The numbers with qualifications
in Thai, Burmese, Cambodian, Lao and
Tagalog are very small and knowledge
of these is at a fairly elementary level,
while there is as yet no qualified Viet-
namese speaker.
A few members of the department
have been trained in certain Asian
languages (chiefly Indonesian) at the
RAAF School of Languages at Point
Cook in Victoria on a full-time basis.
Regular training programmes there for
External Affairs officers commenced only
in the financial year 1962-63 and have
as yet affected only ten people.
Training in other languages generally
recognised as difficult is governed by
other arrangements. Russian is studied
at the ANU on a part-time basis, while
training in Arabic is undertaken during,
or just prior to, a posting to Cairo. Of
the department’s three officers trained in
Arabic, two have not served in the
Middle East during the past ten years.
Training in African languages has not
been organised on a regular basis as yet.
One possible disadvantage which
certain language specialists suffer is that
by specialising in a difficult language,
such as Japanese, they are likely to spend
most of their career alternating between
service in Canberra and the appropriate
capital, such as Tokyo. Thus, some
officers are reluctant to acquire special-
ised language qualifications.
When he is not attending courses in
languages, economics, politics, confer-
ence work or international law, the new
recruit spends his time at a particular
desk, which may deal with such matters
as Western European politics, Korea,
international organisations or economic
agreements, foreign aid or routine de-
partmental administration. During his
first year in the department, he will
occupy two of these desks, gaining first-
hand experience of departmental pro-
cedures as well as developing a special-
ised knowledge of the field in which he
is engaged. Occasionally he may feel
that his transfer to another section of
the department renders fairly useless the
expertise he has devoted the previous
six months to acquiring. Moreover, in
allocating positions within the depart-
ment to new recruits, little if any notice
is taken of a trainee’s previous qualifica-
tions. Thus, a knowledge of a particular
language or of a particular area of
politics may be wasted, to the depart-
ment’s detriment and to the frustration
of the individual concerned.
Each year there is a small exodus from
the department. Some members may
consider the atmosphere within the de-
partment too restricted, they may see
their function as being no more reward-
ing than that of a faithful Government
spokesman, they may find that their own
particular interests lie elsewhere, in the
professions, the academic world or
business. They may, too, feel that,
despite the prestige associated with it,
a career within the diplomatic service is
not sufficiently remunerative or involves
too much personal dislocation, such as is
encountered in organising one’s child-
ren’s education during successive moves
overseas. In short, a career in the ser-
vice possesses its advantages and its
frustrations, as do most occupations, and
whether one wishes to embark on it is
largely a matter of individual taste.
Taking a Captain Cook
The insurance salesman’s odyssey
By R. J. SCHOLFIELD
IF all goes well, as the citizens of
Sydney are collecting their Christ-
mas turkeys in six months’ time,
the shores of the harbor will frame a
sight that may suggest to those who have
not forgotten their history lessons the
arrival of Captain Cook in an earlier
version of the same setting. The sugges-
tion will be apt, for the three-masted
square-rigged topsail schooner that will
glide through the Heads one day near
the end of this year is to retrace much
of the course and recapture some of the
spirit of the famous navigator’s voyage
of nearly 200 years ago.
On board the vessel, which has been
named New Endeavour in honor of
the historic example, will be the brains
behind the journey, a 38-year-old Aus-
tralian life-assurance salesman, adven-
turer and entrepreneur, Geoffrey Layton.
On arrival in his native Sydney, Lay-
ton will have advantages over Captain
Cook. In place of the unknown that
faced his predecessor, he will be return-
ing to settle among people who have
helped him to make a fortune during the
last 14 years in London. He will step
ashore not into the spears of the Sydney-
siders, but into a Bentley that is being
shipped ahead of him and a house over-
looking the water at Clifton Gardens.
Layton’s success in London is a pro-
duct of the Australian dental colony,
and it is largely the turning of this tide
that is taking him, complete with enter-
prises, back to Sydney. Yet when he
first came to London he had hoped to
find fortune in another aspect of the
human mouth, for Layton was a singer.
He left home in 1951, thinking success
in London would follow as a sequel to
eight years of Australian praise for per-
formances in fields ranging from camp
concerts to the NSW Opera Company,
where he sang with June Bronhill in “II

Seraglio”. And he had begun to feel he
was getting somewhere, having satisfied
the critics in “Rainbow Square” and
other London musicals, when someone
advised him to pitch his voice to a higher
register. As in the fable of the dog and
the bone, he failed to become a bari-
tone and at the same time lost his
prowess as a bass.
He had to eat, so he went back to the
job that had been backstop to his singing
in Australia —selling life assurance for
the AMP. One day, having not sold a
drop for six weeks and being down to
his last £2O, he met Bruce Clarke, with
whom he had been in the same Boy
Scout patrol and who was now a dentist.
When Layton told Clarke what he was
doing, the dentist said: “Just the bloke,”
and bought a policy. That was the begin-
ning of Layton’s career.
He asked Clarke how many other
dentists there were in London, got hold
of a dental register and found about 40
Australians in the Commonwealth list,
all using bank addresses. He hired an
office, mailed them and got replies from
nearly all. Overnight he became the
fulcrum of Australian dentists in Britain,
the man who knew more about them
than anyone else a sort of father-
figure.
The relationship might not have borne
such fuit, however, had it not been for
Layton’s knack of linking two or more
enterprises and making them help each
other. As though already sensing this
ability and the terms on which it must
operate, he gave advice, when the
dentists started coming to him for it,
free. And much was it sought. Graduates
arriving in England fresh from Aus-
tralian universities and with no previous
earning experience would tend to fall
for all sorts of traps, signing themselves
up for two years at £25 a week, joining
shady syndicates and making foolish
transactions. Layton’s proximity to the
Australian dental colony taught him
everything that was going on in it, and
the life-assurance depot became also a
dental employment agency and advice
bureau. But his services to the dentists
the arranging of such things as
assistantships and locums and giving
advice remained free. In the dental
field, his only charge was commission
on the sale of practices. With such a
benefactor in their midst, it was only
natural that all assurance business
coming from Australian dentists in
Britain landed in Geoffrey Layton’s lap.
At first called The Australian Dental
Assurance Bureau, in 1960 the firm was
renamed Locums Limited, so that it
could embrace the English market, which
today supplies half its business; practice-
selling and assurance going, as before,
hand in hand. Layton’s premises, which
began as half a room in Thurloe Street,
around the corner from South Kensing-
ton underground station, now fill two
floors of the same building. He has an
inside staff of 10, plus three assurance
reps selling on retainer and commission.
Financially, what Layton has pulled
out of his dentists compares favorably
with what they have extracted from
National Health. Last year he topped
AMP sales for the world, with policies
totalling £1,000,046. He also exceeded
the £1 million mark in 1961 and 1962.
Only one other representative has ever
equalled this in a year. Layton is the
only one ever to have sold £5 million
for AMP, and has a certificate on the
wall of his office to vouch for the feat.
His brother Fred, three years older, came
second for the AMP and first for New
South Wales last year, with £700,000.
Someone at City Mutual Life did not
foresee all this in 1947, when both
brothers were sacked together from the
company after complaning that two
other men had been unfairly promoted
ahead of them. “One of the best things
that ever happened,” says Layton, who
has just left behind him a five-bedroom
house and a three-car garage in three-
quarters of an acre of Surrey.
When he changed the name of his
business in 1960, the polarity of the
British National Health Scheme had
swung around so that it no longer
attracted but repelled. The dentists
were going home, ande Layton decided
he must go with them. He made a
promise to return to Australia five years
hence, and it is with the aid of the
windjammer that sailed from Ramsgate,
England, a few days ago that it is being
fulfilled.
Buccaneering resorts
TPhe New Endeavour belongs to his
latest company, Australian-registered
Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd, which
will operate the 100-ton ship from next
April on 10-day holiday cruises, costing
from £BO to £lOO a head, for 25 people
at a time among the islands of the Whit-
sunday Passage off Queensland’s North
Coast. The idea arose from the ex-
perience of Captain Gordon Keeble, now
the New Endeavor’s skipper, who had
operated similar cruises among the old
buccaneering resorts of the Caribbean.
Keeble, slight, bearded. leathery and
wiry, is an Englishman who has lived
in Australia. He owned a boat-shed at
Kirribilli, worked on the Snowy Moun-
tains Scheme, had four Royal Navy
commands during World War 11, was
master of a cargo ship in the Pacific,
is a veteran of ocean yacht-racing, in-
cluding the Sydney-Hobart, and has had
five years’ charter experience in tft«
Mediterranean.
For the voyage to Australia, Layton’s
Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd has
chartered the vessel to Layton’s Adven-
ture - Under - Sail Syndicate. Twenty
amateur yachtsmen have been recruited
to serve under Captain Keeble’s pro-
fessional command, and each has paid
£4OO sterling for the privilege. To get
them, Layton advertised in “The Times”
and in Australia House’s weekly news
sheet, and distributed to all Australian
haunts in Britain a glossy poster depict-
ing the ship breasting the high seas in
full sail, and saying: “Crew wanted . . .
no previous sailing experience needed.”
He got 150 inquiries, many of which
fizzled out over money, leaving the solid
citizens from which the final choice was
made. They include a doctor, dentist,
broker, architect, scientist, businessman
and farmer’s son. They are a mixture
of Australian and English and their ages
range from 18 to 45 years. Keeble aims
to have taught them all to make it to
the crow’s nest by the time they enter
the Bay of Biscay.
To help glamorise and give point to
the voyage, the route will retrace much
of Captain Cook's, proceeding by way
of Lisbon, the Canaries, Barbados and
the West Indies to Panama Canal, and
thence via the Galapagos Islands, Tahiti,
Tonga, Fiji and Samoa to Sydney in
time, it is hoped, for Christmas.
Back in Sydney, Layton intends to
re-establish himself among the dentists,
and two years ago he formed a company
there which has been nursed along in
anticipation of development on his
arrival. There will be differences, of
course, such as the need, which does not
exist in England, to be registered to
transact dental practices in Australia;
and the fact that there will be less
occasion hor hand-holding with dentist
on their home ground. There will also
be the services of this kind that are
already registered in Australia, mostly
tied to dental supply houses, and Layton
acknowledges the possibilities of a
skirmish here and there, although he has
enough money behind him to be con-
fident about the outcome.
In Australia he proposes to enlarge
his field by taking in the medical pro-
fession as well, fostering, as in England
an interaction between life assurance and
his vocational services. How he intends
to break this new ground is as yet one
of Layton’s trade secrets. All he will
say is that he has done much research
on the matter, and has a plan.
With his flair for complementary
enterprises, it will not be surprising if
there is more than a smattering of
Sydney doctors and dentists clambering
in the rigging of the New Endeavour as
she meanders on tropical idylls.


FORUM
Why Do They Hate Juries?
The conservative backlash
By PHILLIP ROBINSON
The current controversy over the
proposed abolition of juries —in
third party motor vehicle and in-
dustrial compensation cases has not
always been conducted on a dignified or
even honest level. Juries are being
attacked for being capricious, slow,
costly and ignorant.
Take these criticisms in turn.
“They’re capricious”
There are two formidable answers
that can be given to this question. The
first is that approximately 90 per cent of
accident cases are settled by mutual
agreement of the parties before a jury’s
verdict is given some before a writ is
issued, others during preparation as the
nature and extent of the case becomes
apparent, others at the door of the court
and occasionally even later.
It is this extraordinary settlement rate
which alone makes it possible for our
courts to function. If the settlement
rate suddenly dropped to even 50 per
cent three or four times as many cases
would need to be tried and the courts
would be inundated if not overwhelmed
by work.
What makes this degree of agreement
possible? Only the fact that the experts
on each side are able to predict with
accuracy the likely result and its valua-
tion. They, in turn, can regularly bring
clients the injured person on one side
and the claims manager of an insurance
company on the other —to a rational
appreciation of where the “middle
ground” lies. A system where relative
certainty and predictability can enable
such an enormous burden of litigation to
be lifted from the shoulders of the State
and the parties has an immense advan-
tage. What’s the alternative?
In one Australian State three judges
regularly hear these cases, the actual
judge not being known until the morning
of the case. Insurance companies under
these circumstances often give the defen-
dant’s counsel three figures one for
judge A, one for judge B and one for
judge C. Cases are decided “by the
length of the Chancellor’s foot” as the
lawyers say partly at least on the
known differences or peculiarity of the
tribunal.
English experience has been cited by
the abolitionists. In 1963 in Sydney, the
jury question was discussed at a Law
Convention. To an almost incredulous
audience (equally composed of those
who then favored abolition and those
who did not) Lord Parker (the Lord
Chief Justice of England) delivered him-
self as follows:
“I tell a story against myself. I was in
Leeds on assize and I tried 35 cases
and found for the defendant in each
case. The 36th case came along and it
seemed that the plaintiff had a bit of a
kick in his case and I found in his favor.
The defendant promptly took me to the
Court of Appeal and my decision was set
aside.”
One might wonder what the hapless
37th plaintiff might have settled for.
This sort of approach helps explain
current criticisms of awards of damages
in England on the ground that they are
“apallingly low” made by judges who
lack present-day knowledge of living
standards and where awards fail to
accord with community standards. In
February of this year no less than 100
members of the House of Commons
signed a motion intended as “an admoni-
tion” to the courts, conveying these
criticisms, and there has been wide-
spread public criticism of the lack of
juries.
“They cause delay”
Rarely has so much inaccurate
propaganda been peddled about a
legal reform. Persistent quotations from
judges’ statements years old, when there
were serious delays, have been Sprinted
as if they applied to the present time.
These statements have been persistently
made both in the face of the truth and
in the face of correction to the extent
that the controversy has been conducted
with downright dishonesty. In fact, the
institution of an efficient method of list-
ing cases, hard work on the part of the
judges and the co-operation of the pro-
fession, has cut waiting time to an
entirely acceptable and necessary period.
The delay in jury trials after setting
down is about eight months. Allowing
four months for the plaintiff to get out
of hospital, for both parties to receive
instructions, make at least preliminary
enquiries and the writ to be served; this

means that cases can come on if pressed
forward firmly within twelve months.
They are regularly so heard.
No one wants cases brought on
more quickly than this. Serious injuries
take time to settle down; it takes time to
establish whether a man can get back to
work and, if so, what work, and doctors
can't give a final assessment until the
patient is stabilised.
The present “delay” is no delay at all.
No one wants cases heard more quickly.
It is not unusual to have to approach
the court and actually ask for “delay”.
But there are unjustifiable delays in
the Supreme Court in non-jury work. It
takes more than 12 months to have an
undefended divorce heard. It takes at
least two years for a defended case to
come on. The position has never been
worse. Petitioners in northern and
southern NSW take the cases to Bris-
bane or Melbourne respectively to avoid
delays in this judge-only litigation. A
study of the time factor in this field
would be a proper one for law reform.
“They cost more”
The cost of cases heard before a
jury is no more and no less than the
cost of cases in Equity, Divorce or Pro-
bate where juries are unknown. Jury cases
may take more time but a thoroughly pre-
sented case without a jury is not likely to
be much shorter, if shorter at all. Juries
do not give reasons. A judge must. This
is likely to involve legal debate and argu-
ment as it does in Equity and Divorce.
Such cases do not seem to be notably
shorter.
One example of seeming overcharging
has been cited by a retired judge. The
word “seeming” is used because no ex-
planation at all is available of the nature
of the case, its length, difficulty or other
circumstances. Assuming that there was
overcharging, the abolition of juries will
not help the case one whit. It is just as
easy or difficult to overcharge in a non-
jury case as in a jury case. Further, the
ordinary barrister’s fees charged for this
work are often no more than 10 per cent
of the figure cited. For instance, the state-
ment that two views of the scene were
had, each charged at 50 guineas, ignores
the fact that there is often no view at all
and at the most only one and that the
“scale” fee for it is 9 guineas, which in-
cludes travelling expenses. This should be
well known to most commentators and the
purpose of citing the example in connec-
tion with the jury issue remains obscure.
In fact, the scale of legal charges per-
mitted, especially to solicitors, is low. The
average solicitor does not want litigation
and happily gets rid of it if he can. Only
those solicitors who can turn over a
volume of litigation can hope to make it
pay in these days when office overheads
eat up about 60 per cent of profit costs.
“They’re ignorant”
, . .
This proposition is usually more tact-
fully put the judges know better .
The test of conduct in all these cases, as
is carefully and clearly explained to the

Before paper-work gets on top of you . . .
visit the 3M Business Communications Centre
You get a whole new approach to paper-work
from the 3M Business Communications people.
They will suggest new methods and systems
that save man-hours and reduce office over-
heads. More important, they’ll design them so
your business won’t outgrow them.
When a 3M Business Communications Con-
sultant meets you, he won’t talk much. He
wants you to! About the papef-work you have,
to tackle. Because equipping an office is like
measuring someone for a suit —the product
must fit the individual’s need.
But he will ask questions . . . what type of
paper-work do you have? Correspondence?
Reports? Financial records? Internal forms?
Which departments handle the most paper-
work?
Then he assesses how and where 3M’s Systems
and Copying Products can save typing and
clerical effort, and speed the paper-work flow
throughout your organisation.
But first he’ll invite you to the 3M Business
Communications Centre, to see for yourself the
3M range of machines and papers. But why
wait for an invitation? Come and see what’s
new in money-saving paper-work methods any
time at 3M.

divorced from those who he is supposed
to evaluate? The judge’s very status and
security are designed to detach him from
the reality of experience on a flesh and
blood basis.
In this sense it is suggested that there
are two sorts of experts. Just as judges
are expert in the law, juries are expert in
the facts of every-day living. Each expert
should have his own field.
In New South Wales practitioners have
had experiences of their judges. Nobody
wants to catalogue what lessons experi-
ence has brought. It should be enough
to point out that the Bar, solicitors who
practise in the field, plaintiffs, and last,
but by no means least, the insurance com-
panies themselves, including the Govern-
ment Insurance Office, all want juries re-
tained. In fact,, in the District Court,
where a request (automatically granted)
has to be filed to obtain a jury in those
few cases where a plaintiff does not seek a
jury, the Government Insurance Office
regularly files a request itself for a jury.
All the parties want to retain juries, and
there is no public agitation to the contrary.
Lastly, the political aspect calls into
question the Government mandate to
abolish juries in some 9G per cent of the
cases heard in the Supreme Court.
In 1961 the then Leader of the Opposi-
tion, Mr P. Morton, proposed in plain
language to abolish juries in motor vehicle
third party cases. No mention whatever
was made of abolishing juries in industrial
compensation cases. This was clear
enough and history records that he did
not get a mandate.
The Premier, Mr R. Askin, in his policy
speech delivered on April 13, 1965,
said only: “A Liberal Government will
tackle law reform seriously and pay
special regard to the preservation of basic
human rights . . .”
As a description of what is involved in
this "special regard - ’ the politest thing that
can be said of the mandate sought is that
it served to disguise the true intention of
the Government. The other available
alternative is that it was calculated to
deceive (as it did deceive) both the public
and the legal profession.
Under no circumstances can this man-
date be said to justify the Draconian
measure of abolishing juries in accident'
cases. Rightly or wrongly,, it has been a
basic human right to have both civil and
criminal matters heard by a jury and
“special regard” for them requires their
strengthening and extension, not their
abolition.
Why, then, all the fuss? Simply this:
Since the 1930 s the rights which ordinary
people had but could not then afford to
enforce have gradually become enforce-
able. trade unions have been prepared
to support their members financially in
pursuit of their rights when injured dur-
ing employment. And since the Motor
Vehicle (Third Party) Insurance Act,
1942, in the motor vehicle field anyone
with a claim, whether he has money in
his pocket or not, can now secure advice
and representation by merely ringing
solicitors listed in the pink pages. This
is the reality and no honest commentator
doubts it.
A social revolution has come about
almost unnoticed. The man-in-the-street
has become our commonest class of liti-
gant. He has not only the right but the
ability to go to law and he has done so
in increasing numbers.
Legal administration has lagged behind
this new dimension of the law. Inadequate
courts, not enough judges, overworked
judges, old procedures, manifest injustices
such as the stalemate rule in contributory
negligence, have continued. Government
has never really faced up to the problem.
These needless sources of irritation have
given impetus to a form of social reaction
against this democratisation of the law
and specious arguments about “delay”,
cost and uncertainty have been deployed
as rationalisations against jury trials.
In affluent and free society expediency
should not triumph over principle.
Letters to the Editor
Public Service Salaries
SIR.—Mr Gordon Chesterman’s article
(8., June 12) on the subject of Federal
Public Service salaries quotes some naive
comment from the Acting Federal Secre-
tary of the Administrative and Clerical
Officers’ Association, Mr S. Irner. Mr
lmer is reported to have said that since
Chairman Mr F. H. Wheeler took over
the Public Service Board there has been
a “change of policy and acceptance of a
responsible attitude” towards wage-fixing,
whereas previously the Board had refused
all claims and resisted everything in the
traditional employer’s role. Mr Imer's
assessment of the Board is fanciful. The
Board opposed with all its might the
claims by Engineers and in the ultimate
judgment of the Arbitration Commission
it was clearly demonstrated that the Board
was niggardly and unrealistic in its calcu-
lation of fair remuneration based on
work value. The Board fought strenuously
against the Legal Officers' salary applica-
tion and aga’n the Arbitration tribunal
was impelled to improve upon the rates
fixed by the Board. Then the Board
sought to prevent the Architects from
participating in the economic margin
adjustments and once more the Board was
rebuffed by the Commission. The Board
opposed! the rises sought by Technical and
Drafting Officers, but the Arbitrator
granted more than the Board was pre-
pared to pay. The Public Service Associa-
tions were impelled to walk out of the
Commission in the Second Division
Officers' case because the Board failed to
honor an agreement on the conduct of the
hearing. Delays by the Board in dealing
with reclassification claims in almost
every department are creating widespread
discontent throughout the Commonwealth
Service. Recruitment in NSW and Vic-
toria is collapsing and overall efficiency is
thereby declin ng. NSW members of Mr
Imer’s organisation do not share his re-
ported enthusiasm for Mr Wheeler's
“responsible attitude” which is really
directed solely towards maintaining de-
pressed conditions in the Federal Service
in accordance with the wage policy of
the present Government.

SlR.—Tanner’s astronauts-in-search-of-a-
gag-writer cartoon (B. June 12} stirs up
thoughts that one had sternly suppressed
as being carping: The mind boggles at the
courage and discipline required to voyage
rn space. Yet a subversive section of it
cries out in frustration that so little of the
wonder and beauty of the cosmic scene
has been communicated to us (where is
the transcendent phrase, the inspirational
on-the-spot comment?) by that handful
Of intrepid men whose eyes have feasted
on it. One thinks of Mallory on Everest;
his “white fang excrescent from the jaws
of the w'orld”. And one dreams of the
day when a Mallory will walk in space.
Of course. Mallory was not successful in
his enterprise. The astronauts —to our
everlasting gratitude were. Ah well . . .

Press Gallery
SIR, —Mr Brian Johns’ article on the
workings of the parliamentary press gal-
lery in Canberra (8., June 12) illustrates
clearly that restrictive trade practices are
to be found in the ranks of working
journalists as well as in the fields of
commerce and industry. However, I must
take issue with Mr Johns on one point.
The ‘'Daily Mirror”, which is the only
afternoon newspaper not holding mem-
bership in a “club" is the only afternoon
newspaper credited by Mr Johns with full
membership of such an organisation. Mr
Johns knows very well, but it is puzzling
that he did not mention that the represen-
tatives of the Sydney "Sun” the Mel-
bourne “Herald”, the Brisbane “Tele-
graph” and the Perth "Daily News” all

afternoon papers exchange copies of
all their stories. This is a cartel or “club”
just as exclusive and just as tight as that
operating among some of the morning
newspapers. The fifth afternoon news-
paper represented in Canberra is the
“Daily Mirror”, which operates com-
pletely independently of this “club”.
Mr Johns defined a “club” as an organ-
isation providing for an exchange of copy
between bureaux and then went on to
declare that the “Daily Mirror” had a
“club” with “The Australian”. How can
there be an exchange of stories between
the two newspapers’ representatives in
Parliament House when most of “The
Australian” copy is not written before the
‘ Mirror” stops publication for the day?
Apart from this point, the article was an
accurate outline of the workings of the
Press gallery' in Canberra.

[Mr Johns replies:
I perhaps should have been more ex-
plicit. I did mention the afternoon news-
paper club (not including the Perth
“Daily News”, because at the time of
writing like the Adelaide “News” it
did not maintain its own Canberra corres-
pondent). By describing the afternoon
dailies’ club as having “associate member-
ship” with the morning dailies, I meant
that junior delivers more than he receives
from big brother. I thought that this was
also true of the “Mirror” and “The Aus-
tralian”.]
Bully For The Council
SlR.—Patricia Rolfe wields a nifty type-
writer and hit the buttons on the head for
most of her interesting article on the Arts
Council (8., June 12). However, the final
paragraph must mystify both Arts Council
adherents and detractors. Who are these
“people on the fringes of the Council”
who “instead of hammering ceaselessly
for more money, seem to regard the
subsidy as a pension”? Was Miss Rolfe
pushed for a rousing finale for her other-
wise excellent article and, perforce,
created an animal that does not exist?
Selling the Arts and Entertainments to
the country is no easy task, as Miss Rolfe
has clearly established, but I think readers
must also agree that the attainment of in-
creased subsidies is an equally tight-rope
path. The Arts Council is the only
group working in a practical manner to-
wards some decentralisation and dis-
semination to the country of the livelier
arts and it is common sense that a fair
share of any cash forthcoming for in-
creased cultural activities in NSW must be
allotted in the Council's direction. Bully
for the Arts Council it's doing some-
thing; who else is?

ON THE MARGIN
Three’s Company
fl\iE extraordinary case of Mrs Polly
A Andrus, the woman who lived with
two “husbands”, has fascinated Sydney.
The facts only came to light when Mrs
Andrus was taken to hospital after a
road accident. Nurses were surprised
to notice that two husbands brought her
flowers, and soon the Press got wind
of it.
Mrs Andrus is a handsome, strongly-
built woman. For the past three years
she has lived happily with Les Andrus
and Ted McDim and their two children.
Les is a bricklayer and Ted is a car-
penter. The two husbands are insepar-
able friends, and members of the same
Leagues Club.
Unusual though her situation is,
friends say that Polly Andrus lives in
many ways like a typical Australian
housewife. In the morning she picks up
two pairs of male pyjamas off the floor.
Two men refer to her as “the missus”.
In the evening two husbands fall asleep
in front of the TV set.
The difference is mainly
in number.
Husband Les told his
side of the story to “The
Daily Mirror”. “A lot of
people are criticising Ted and Polly and
me, but we don’t care,” he said. “It’s all
quite simple and natural. I love Polly.
Ted loves Polly. Polly loves us both.
And we all love the children.
“I was the one that set up house with
her first. Polly is a wonderful woman,
and very—well—affectionate. One day
she said to me: ‘Les, I’ve got something
to tell you. I’ve fallen in love with Ted
McDim, as well as you. Would you mind
if he came to live with us?’
“Ted is an old mate of mine. I told
her I had no objection. ‘The more the
merrier,’ I said. The arrangement works
very sensibly. Ted and I sleep with Polly
one at a time. Every night we toss up
to decide which of us it will be. There
are never any complaints, even when
one of us loses the toss three or four
nights in a row.
“It’s a good set-up financially. As
well as what Ted and 1 earn, Polly goes
out to a job. Neither Ted nor I has
any objection to working wives. Actually
it makes things easier for us—we get in
a few days’ fishing now and then.”
Ted McDim gave a frank interview to
“The Sun”. “I met Polly Andrus at a
barbecue at the club,” he said. “It was
a case of love at first sight. There is
something about Polly’s eyes a man
can’t resist them.
“People say they don’t understand
how Les and I can share Polly without
any jealousy or rows. The reason is,
she never shows any favoritism. She
irons the same number of shirts for each
of us. She gives us the same helpings
of steak. If we come home full from
the club, she roars at us equally. In the
morning when she goes off to work, she
kisses both Ted and me goodbye.
“Some women are jealous of Polly for
having two men. They think it’s more
than her fair share. But she is more
than an ordinary woman. It doesn’t
matter how long she is in hospital, Les
and I will be waiting loyally for her
when she comes out.”
A leading psychiatrist, consulted by
“The Mirror”, commented on the case.
He said: “Mrs Polly Andrus is a woman
with an exceptional power
over men. I believe her
curious, penetrating eyes
may have a hypnotic
effect. She is a sister under
the skin to the grandes
amoureuses of history. There are definite
points of resemblance between Polly
Andrus and Cleopatra, Ninon de
I’Enclos, Catherine the Great, Lola Mon-
tez and Liz Taylor. Moreover, Mrs
Andrus is said to be an excellent cook.”
Polly Andrus herself, who has not yet
recovered, gave an interview to “The
Sun” in hospital.
“I hope Les and Ted are getting on
all right at home without me,” she said.
“They’re splendid husbands—neither of
them has ever looked at anyone else.
“No, I don’t regret my marriages.
There is nothing like having two men
about the house. Whenever I have any
trouble, 1 always talk it over with my
husbands.
“I’ll never forget my honeymoons. I
was so happy I used to sing: ‘We’ll have
a wee room, a tea-room for three room,
And every day’s a holiday because I’m
married to youse.’
“Tell my husbands I liked the pictures
of them in the papers, and not to worry.
It’s very quiet and nice here. Actually
it’s like a complete rest, and I think I
need one. I didn’t realise it until I came
here, but I’m tired—terribly tired—.”

OVERSEAS
The Teach-in Revolt
Policy-makers , intellectuals and Vietnam
The surprising thing about the
present wave of dissent among the
American scholarly community
concerned with foreign policy is not
merely its level but the people who
have emerged on the one hand as its
leaders, and on the other as the chief
spokesmen in the Administration’s
defence. Perhaps the form of the protest,
the “teach-in”, has led to some under-
rating abroad of its intellectual sub-
stance and influence. Even in London,
which is normally very quick to pick up
and indeed to magnify any tremors of
intellectual uneasiness in America, the
great “teach-in” in Washington in May
passed with hardly more than the kind
of notice given to an Oxford Union
debate.
American official spokesmen have
tended to propagate this impression, dis-
missing the w'hole thing as just another
sign of spring on the campus. This
would be plausible enough if it were
only, or chiefly, students who were its
originators. But Professors Morgenthau
and Kahin are hardly of an age to be
much affected by tendencies to effer-
vescence in the spring. Nor are they
members of that stage army of card-
carrying non-conformists whose names
can be relied on to appear as sponsor-
ing every fashionable progressive cause
from Wallace for President to the aboli-
tion of capital punishment. Morgenthau
is the most notable American theorist
of power-politics, a man in the best
tradition of Machiavelli and Clausewitz,
and though in terms of the American
. party system he would be classed as a
liberal Democrat, in terms of personal
intellectual position he can be regarded
as a traditionalist conservative, and cer-
tainly one highly resistant to undue
optimism about international politics.
He is an unlikely man to have emerged
as the most damaging critic of President
Johnson’s policies, yet on the televised
version of the Washington “teach-in”,
this viewer would certainly accord him
that status. Like Kennan and Lipp-
mann he is frequently subjected to the
charge that his power-analysis is too
strongly Europe-oriented, that he does
not rightly estimate Asia’s place in the
world balance. This seems to me less
true of Morgenthau than of the other
two, but perhaps one might maintain
that his characteristic line of reasoning,
with its insistent stress on the relations
of strength, lends itself to a rather easy
acquiescence in the notion of South-East
Asia as a near-inevitable sphere of
Chinese predominance. This may look
all very tidy and intellectually con-
sistent from Europe or North America,
but it is bound-to look rather alarming
from Australia.
In large part, the Administration has
brought the scholarly dissent upon itself
by the rationalisations policy which it
has felt necessary to present to the public
at various stages of the Vietnam involve-
ment. The official orthodoxy, or rather
orthodoxies, for there have been an
embarrassing number of versions since
McNamara’s first visit to Vietnam when
By CORAL BELL
(Senior Lecturer in Government at the
University of Sydney , who has recently
returned from the United States and Britain)
he blithely predicted an early upturn for
the West, have been so difficult to square
with the actual development of events
as to drive the scholarly conscience into
protest. Hence Morganthau’s passionate
declaration that the most sacred duty of
an academic is to tell the truth, and
George Kahin’s painstaking re-examina-
tion of the development of the* crisis.
Of course, half the policy-makers, from
the Secretary of State- down, are them-
selves ex-academics with acute sensitivi-
ties of their own, perhaps now rubbed
24-hour Vietnam "teach-in" University of California.
pretty raw by the necessities of power.
Thus the tone of their response to the
academic critics has been notably testy.
Asking questions at a lower level of the
policy-making scale, one gets very
strongly the impression of an anguished
defensiveness. Washington is rather an
uncomfortable spot for the pursuit of
foreign-policy researchers at the moment.
The most successful line of defence
of Administration policy was un-
doubtedly that of Robert Scalapino,
standing in at practically no notice what-
ever for McGeorge Bundy when at the
last moment he decided not to appear.
Mr Bundy is a busy man, and doubtless
it is unfair to assume that he withdrew
because he was uncertain of carrying
conviction, yet that impression was in-
evitably conveyed. The only other really
formidable name appearing for the
defence was Professor Schlesinger, and
one feels that his rather detached ironic
acceptance of the essential unsatisfactori-
ness of things would hardly be t<s the
taste of President Johnson.
Can the critics have any influence on
policy? Not, one would say, in the
immediate future. President Johnson
does not love intellectuals, nor they him,
and he is certainly not dependent on
them for electoral support. Nothing short
of an act of God or a Far Eastern
cataclysm seems likely to deprive him of
the certainty of power until 1972. But
let us assume that the present line of
policy in Vietnam may fail over the next
five months, as the critics mostly believe
it will. Failure would mean that the
military situation in the South, far from
being alleviated, by the bombings of the
North (even if they are escalated to in-
clude Hanoi), continues to deteriorate to
a degree that would reduce Western

control to bridgeheads round Saigon and
Da Nang. If this occurs (and the die will
probably be cast by October) then South
Vietnam could only be restored to the
Western sphere of influence by a larger-
than-Korea commitment of American
troops, perhaps half a million men.
I asked one of the most notable and
most “hard-line” of American China
scholars, who has backed every move
of the Administration until now, whether
he would continue his backing if the
cost were raised to this level. He said
that he would not. Of course one ought
not to read too much symptomatic im-
portance into the views of one scholar,
however influential. Yet the reply is
indicative of the fact that expert opinion,
even if it is totally in sympathy with
the objectives of official policy, will tend
to take a fresh critical look at its direc-
tion as the cost in terms of national
resources progressively rises. If the
current estimates of the state of official
strategic thinking in Washington are true,
the involvement may be about to enter
the stage at which really substantial
political costs are incurred, in terms of
the American lives that could be lost
in the sort of campaigning that would
be involved. In this situation, even so
marginal a factor, in President John-
son’s normal scheme of things, as the
opinions of his intellectual critics might
have an effect on policy choices.
The most striking single change in
Washington, to one who last visited it
in the days of the Kennedy Administra-
tion, is the alienation of the rank-and-file
“Kennedy intellectuals” from the Presi-
dent. He retained their loyalty pretty
well during the year of office that he
inherited after the assassination, but in
this first six months of his own term
of power the cleavage has become so
deep as to remind one of the atmosphere
at the end of the Eisenhower years. Per-
haps this development was always in-
evitable, given the President’s personality
and temperament, but the foreign policy
headaches of Vietnam and the Domini-
can Republic have been the major factors
in its speed. Only half-jokingly it is said
that the real reason for the alleged
growth of neo-isolationism among this
normally internationalist segment of
American opinion is their view that as
long as Johnson is in charge of American
foreign policy the less there is of it the
better. Dean Rusk's understanding of
world politics is not impugned, but it
is argued that while he was a good Sec-
retary of State for Kennedy, who really
wanted to be his own chief policy-maker,
and was capable of it, in the Johnson
era Rusk's relatively unassertive person-
ality has meant that he takes a back
seat to McNamara, and even to some
of his own subordinates such as Thomas
Mann, Johnson’s primary source of
advice on Latin-American affairs. The
impression created by the Dominican
affair, of policy-making rather falling
over its own feet after a new Ambassador
and a new CIA chief had disastrously
combined to “press the panic button”
unnecessarily, has of course sharpened
the dissensions over Vietnam.
By contrast, what is surprising about
Harold Wilson’s situation in England is
how little effective opposition he has
had so far to face within his own party,
despite his pursuit of foreign and defence
policies that are certainly anathema to
the Left. That is not to say that there
have been no protests against his support
of American policy in Vietnam, or the
increasing commitment of the most sub-
stantial part of British military power
to “east of Suez”, or the fact that the
renunciation of the British nuclear force
(which many Leftists probably envisioned
vaguely as an actual disposing somehow
of nuclear-warheads, a bonfire of V-
bombers, and a tearing-up of Polaris
contracts), turned out to mean only a
formal placing of British strike-power
at the disposal of Nato.
In one sense, the support given to
Vietnam policy has been harder for the
Left to swallow than any of the other
deviations of the Government from what
it wistfully thinks of as a true socialist
foreign policy. The support is in-
terpreted to mean the risk of a full-
scale conflict with China and a breach
in the rapprochement with Russia, as
well as acquiescence in military measures
such as the use of napalm, which create
a genuine moral revulsion. Yet the
Prime Minister has not had to face any-
thing much more politically damaging
than a few editorials, a pained Commons
motion signed by 45 Labor MPs, and a
“New Statesman” competition for the
speech he would have made on Vietnam
if he were still leader of the Opposition.
Ends and Means
Tn part, his relative immunity lies in his
very vulnerability. With the Govern-
ment’s majority preserved only by the
casting vote of the Conservative speaker
on some occasions during the Budget
debates, with the borough elections
apparently showing a swing to the Con-
servatives, and the higher income tax
rates just about to hit the middle-class
floating vote, the Left of the party cannot
afford to do anything that would pre-
cipitate an election before Labor’s pros-
pects begin to look rosier, at earliest
perhaps next June. Another rapid loss
of office, after 13 years in the wilder-
ness, would be almost too severe a blow
for the party to sustain without cracking.
So even those most disenchanted with
Mr Wilson will not rock the boat very
hard on foreign policy, unless unbear-
ably provoked. Besides, the Left is not
impressively led at the moment, the
Prime Minister having adroitly removed
most of its potential leaders to high (and
harmless) Government office: Barbara
Castle to Overseas Development, An-
thony Greenwood to Colonies, Frank
Cousins to Technology, John Freeman
to India. It is an instructive contrast
with the days of the Korean dissidence
when the rebels were Aneurin Bevan,
and John Freeman, and Harold Wilson:
no one can say that Mr Wilson does not
profit by his own experiences.
There are other contrasts, too. The
optimistic assumption of 1950 that
China would redeem the hopes so sadly
disappointed in Russia, which was very
influential in attitudes to that earlier
approach to war between China and
America and was exemplified in G. D. H.
Cole’s letter in the “New Statesman”, has
almost died. The Chinese polemics with
Russia, combined with the hostilities
against India, made it difficult even to
the most starry-eyed “New Statesman”
reader to sustain the hope that Asian
Marxist revolutionaries might, after all,
be more inclined than their European
equivalents to that tender-mindedness
about means that the English Liberal-


Left still very properly cherishes.
Furthermore, there is some appreciation
of the connection between the British
commitment to Malaysia and the
American commitment to Vietnam.
One comes across an occasional
tendency to regard this “you-support-me-
and-I’ll-support-you” aspect of British
and American policy in South-East Asia
as a species of corrupt bargain on Mr
Wilson’s part, but on the whole the com-
mitment to Malaysia, and to “east of
Suez” generally, encounters very little
resistance among the Left. This is be-
-cause Malaysia as a cause benefits from
an exceedingly powerful, quite automatic
emotional commitment to the Common-
wealth. As someone has observed, it is
easier for Mr Wilson to justify nuclear
weapons to his own followers as possibly
necessary to the future defence of India
than as necessary to the defence of
Britain itself. Though the remaining
V-bombers may be becoming obsolescent
vis-a-vis Russian defensive systems, they
should be viable for an indefinite period
against any air defences that China has
at present in prospect.
This reversal of party attitudes to
Britain's overseas connections is a fas-
cinating study. Nowadays, the Common-
wealth is the internationalism of the Left
(particularly because of its inter-racial
aspect) whereas Europe is the inter-
nationalism of the Right. And since the
Commonwealth as a faith means “east of
Suez” as a defence commitment, it
comes under attack only by the
afficionadoes of the rival faith of Europe,
such as Lord Gladwyn for the Liberal
Party, and a few of the more tough-
minded Conservative intellectuals. There
are some potential developments of
American policy in Vietnam which could
be so sharp a goad to the conscience of
the Left as to modify this picture: for
instance the bombing of Hanoi.
American military political concepts
concerning Vietnam, especially the
theory behind the present bombings,
have excited scepticism among those who
have been professionally concerned with
insurgency situations, as well as re-
probation on the political Left and, one
would say, among popular opinion
generally. Naturally if the Conservatives
should succeed to office this year or next
the situation will be entirely changed.
For one thing, the professional and
political critics of “east of Suez” as the
major British military commitment may
be a good deal more powerful with a
Conservative government. For another,
the Left’s revulsion against America’s
use of power in the Johnson mood of
uninhibited nationalism could then
acquire a far more formidable leader
than Mr Zilliacus: Mr Harold Wilson.

An Indian View
The writer of tlie following letter
to the “New York Times’ \ C.
Rajagopalachari, was Governor-
General of India from 1948 to 1950
and one of the leaders in India’s
struggle for independence.
To the Editor:
There is no doubt that there is a
vast amount of reasoned and ap-
parently unanswerable criticism and
ridicule of the logic of the United
States President’s defence of South
Vietnam, not only in the world Press,
but issuing from the best brains of
America itself.
On the other hand, there is not the
slightest doubt that if America with-
draws and leaves South-East Asia to
itself, Communist China will advance
and seize . the continent. All the
people of Asia will soon be in-
timidated to pay homage to the Com-
munist Parties in each of the regions
in Asia and the empire of China
under Mao and his successors will be
firmly established.
If this forecast is admitted to be
sound, as it must be, there is no
room ‘ for logic - chopping. What
America should do must be decided
on the expediency plane and not
based on ideological dialectical debate.
These ideological considerations have
no real application where terrorism
has full play and men act, talk and
even think on lines enforced by others
and not out of their own convictions
or inclinations.
There is no hope for freedom of
thought in Asia if the hegemony, if
not the empire, of China is estab-
lished. And it is not too far-fetched
a thought if one believes that Russia,
too, will be compelled to toe the line
for China as soon as the latter has
demonstrated its power in vast Asia,
or even a little in advance.
There is no hope to get out of this
great tangle unless India and Japan
realise their duty in this connection
and enter into a firm solemn defence
treaty for defending the free way of
life against the advance of Com-
munism and act swiftly, and, if one
may put it that way, without logical
compunctions.
The battle will be lost if action is
not taken soon. Japan and India can
and should get the United Nations to
authorise them in this respect on
behalf of the nations of the world,
so that America may not be deemed
an interloper if she puts her vast
power at the disposal of Japan and
India in terms of the defence treaty
adumbrated herein to defend Asia
against Communist China.
These thoughts should be seriously
reflected on by those in authority in
India, Japan and the US. There is
not much time to be lost.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The Man Behind Sutherland
Richard Bonynge, artistic director of the Williamson-Sutherland opera season, and
husband of Joan Sutherland, talks to The Bulletin about “bel canto” singing, “out-
of-the-way” operas, the Sydney Opera House and how to fill it, about Australia’s
place in international music and, of course, about Miss Sutherland.
THE BULLETIN: Mr Bonynge, when
was the Australian tour first mooted?
BONYNGE: Williamsons actually
asked us a long time ago, I orget exact y
when. People have always asked us to
do concert tours which we did not par-
ticularly want to do, because to do con-
certs for God knows how long would
be a bore. It was about 18 months ago
c ,,. , , . f
that we first decided to form an opera
, , • i u i j
company. We had previously been asked
.■j . . . *.u a D u f
to do a concert tour by the ABC, but
, , c • , r
were prevented from going because ot
T , ...
oan s i ness.
When Williamsons asked for another
concert tour we explained that for Joan ?
to return to Australia to appear in con-
ceits would be to show only half of wnat
she is capable of doing. She loves the
opera much more and wanted to appear
in opera theie. Williamsons agreed. At
first it started out to be a very small
thing. They had some old sets in stock
and they thought she could come and do
the odd “Traviata”, and things they could
easily put on. However, we managed to
persuade them to do a proper opera
season, to make new sets and costumes
and do quite a lot of works. The actual
number of operas changed around: they
didn ., want to do so many at first and
j wan(cd t 0 do morej so we compromised
Qn seven
Wh - V d,d . ch "“ st ' th * o P cras S'o-
- presenting.
From Joan s point of view I naturally
chose Lucia Di Lammermoor because
. . , . , c A , ,
it was the opera which first made her
, T itr „ , ,„ ,
famous. I chose La Sonnambula be-
..r. . . ,
cause it is my favorite role for her. She
. A J. ... . ,
is a great Bellini singer and the one
singer today who has really studied the
s tyj e t j^ s com p o ser and understands
it j think Australia shou i d hea r how
a B e ui n i opera is performed and sung,
“La y rav i a t a ” j s h er favorite role. She
do es “p aus f’ because it is not only a
lovely role for her but because we
wanted to do it as a homage to Dame
Nellie Melba. “Semiramide” she does
because it is her great, great bravura
ro l e , and I think I can safely say that
there is nobody else in the world who
dare try to sing it. It is one of these
unattainably difficult roles.
And the other two operas in which
Miss Sutherland does not sing?
We chose them to make as much
contrast as possible in the repertory and
because we love them. “L’Elisir
D’Amore” is a wonderful, light comedy
with the most extraordinarily beautiful
music, a great master work, and
“Eugene Onegin” is a wonderful, in-
timate, domestic - work almost, of a
slightly later period. But the whole
emphasis of the season is on the bel
canto period. In fact, we would love to
have brought an 18th-century work but
many people were against us doing this.
I hope another time to bring “Alcina” or
some other big 18th-century work. They
are wonderful for Joan to sing, because
technically they require such resources.
The great days and the great heights
of bel canto were at the beginning of
the 18th century, when the operatic world
was dominated not by the soprano and
the tenor as today but by the castrato.
The castrato voice is very hard to define
today. There are a few old records left
from which we can get a vague idea
but one can get much more of an idea
from studying the music which they
sang. We are trying now to recreate
performances as they were done in those
days. Now we hope to make recordings
showing our ideas of how they were
done.
Did you have access to knowledge
which no one else has in this century?
By no means, except that I’ve talcen
the trouble to go to libraries and find
books, most of which are easily available,
but people don't bother to study them.
Many are in antique German. They set
out the decorations, and write out many
famous arias and exactly how they were
sung by many famous singers.
Is it possible for a great “bel canto”
soprano today to repeat the technique
of the “castrati”?
It is perfectly possible but it is very
hard muscular work. The more one
attempts to do with one’s voice the more
muscular and breath control one must
have. The essence of bel canto is control.
Has Australia ever heard a “bel
canto” singer in the true sense before?
Melba came out of the bel canto
tradition, there’s no doubt about that.
Her teacher was Marchesi, who was the
pupil of Garcia, who was the great
teacher of bel canto. She sang Gilda
which is very much a bel canto role,
although it comes at the end of the
period. She sang Violetta; she sang, I
think, Lucia, but I don’t really remember
if she sang them in Australia. I know
she sang “Faust” and “Boheme” be-
cause my grandfather heard her and
told me all about it.
But Australia has not heard a great


many bel canto operas, and certainly not
many sung by great sopranos of recent
years. There have been performances
by visiting Italians, of operas like* “The
Barber of Seville”, which is a truly bel
canto opera, but I can’t actually say that
it got a truly bel canto performance. Not
the one I heard, anyway, which was
about 20 years ago.
How did Miss Sutherland overcome
her back trouble?
lam not a doctor, so I cannot give
the medical details. She was advised
by many doctors to have operations, and
she was advised by just as many others
not to. Then she found a Swedish
masseuse in New York who used to
come to her and force her to exercise. At
first it was agony. She was literally un-
able to move certain parts of her body.
But the masseuse believed that the
muscles in the back had deteriorated
because the trouble was nervous and
muscular damage combined. She gave
Joan intensive exercises every day, put
her on a rather strict diet and built the
deteriorated muscles up again until now
she is very strong. When we are in
America Joan still goes to this masseuse
all the time, and as far as we are con-
cerned she is rather a salvation to us.
How have you planned the Australian
tour to fit in with this new routine?
In the first place we do not have any
new operas to learn. This saves a great
deal of strain. On the other hand, we
must perform three times a week. I
think J. C. Williamson’s would have
liked her to perform five, or more. But
we have made an absolute rule of never
performing more than three times. In
London we only ever perform twice a
week. Because she will be on stage
three times a week in Australia she can-
not sing anywhere else at all, under any
circumstances whatever. So, much as
we would like to oblige everybody and
make everybody happy, she cannot
appear on television or sing for clubs
or concerts. The whole of the time is
taken up with the tour.
We must be loyal to Williamson’s be-
cause they are putting on this season for
us. And also we must be loyal to the
theatre audiences. If she wants to sing
wjell three times a week for 14 weeks,
she must have plenty of rest. On the
day of the performance she will probably
stay in bed until 1 p.m. Then she
will exercise, probably take a long walk
and then go straight to the theatre. The
night before a performance she certainly
cannot be up late. This may sound like
a rather unglamorous apd strict regime
but it is absolutely necessary for any
voice really, especially for a voice as
high as Joan’s and with such a big.range.
I think far too many people expect
perfection every time they come to a
theatre to hear her sing. Very often
they get stunning performances. But I
think it is very wrong that they should
expect them as a matter of course. I
think that they should be grateful when
they hear great performances by any
singer in a theatre. Naturally, I think
that every performer performs as well
as he can. But it is a human thing.
Performers are not machines. You don’t
press a button and everything works.
It is something that is bound up with
a million other things as well. One
night you will hear extraordinary, un-
believable things so that you can hardly
credit that they are happening. Other
days the level of excitement will be lower.
What do you hope to achieve in the
way of building up a new opera audience
in Australia through this tour?
A new opera audience is, of course,
the young people of any country. I
hope we can make some arrangement
whereby the students from the music
colleges and schoolchildren are able to
come to some performances. I suppose
from Williamson’s financial point of
view this is very difficult. I think I will
ask them to open dress rehearsals to
children and students, because I think
it would be a great tragedy if they were
barred because of the high cost of seats.
I know there is already current opera
in Australia and I know that they are
doing marvellous work. I heard with
great pleasure some performances last
summer. But they have a limited
repertoire at the moment. It is not fully
representative. Neither is our repertoire,
of course, but we, together with them,
will balance out the repertoire a little
more. I think that the young people
must be given a chance to become aware
of all the different styles of music, and
then they can make up their own minds
what they will like. Some will like
Wagner, some Puccini, others Donizetti,
Bellini, others will like Handel, Mozart
and Haydn. Some people will like it
all.
I don’t think that anyone need worry
about filling the new Opera House in
Sydney. This will depend on them doing
the right operas, with the right people,
in the right way. I cannot stress enough
the matter of doing them in the right
way. You cannot, for instance, perform
a Puccini opera the way you perform
a Mozart opera. You can’t perform
Handel as you would Bellini. I don’t
think that any one person is capable of
doing all these things. I have never met
one yet in my life and I don’t expect to.
When they get around to selecting all
the new people who will run the new
theatre they should make sure that they
have experts in every field. They must
have experts, not amateurs and people
who are just “very interested” and who
would like to become part of it for
prestige sake. They must have people
who know, and who are used to working
in great theatres. Then they must invite
big stars and put on opera properly.
They have spent so much on the
Opera House now (which I understand
is paid for by lotteries) I think that they
might continue the lotteries and spend
some good money on production and
singers. This would give Australia what
it deserves, which is really great opera.
Opera is very expensive. J. C. William-
son’s are, of course, putting on as good a
season as they can possibly manage, but
this is all being financed by one com-
pany. But with the Elizabethan Trust
and with the Government behind them
and the big State lotteries, I see no reason
why they sould not be able to afford one
of the most lavish opera companies in
the world.
They should then do the great operas
that the public wants to hear, not just try
to be snobbish and do modern, out-of-
the-way things just so that everyone will
say, “Isn’t the director marvellous be-
cause he does this and that, and the
other we’ve never heard of before!”
Do you feel that Australian musicians
have sufficient potential to provide
these?
Yes, as long as they get the right
people to guide them. There are great
Australian singers singing all over the
world. Sylvia Fisher had a marvellous
career at Covent Garden. Now we have
Margreta Elkins there. Half of Sadler’s
Wells’ stars are Australian. These are
very fine singers who would grace any
operatic stage, giving marvellous per-
formances. But even they needed to be
guided. And there must be someone with
the knowledge to cast people for the right
roles. I go to opera all the time and I
hear people singing roles who have no
right to be singing them. If we begin
the right way we shall go on the right
way.
How do you see Australia’s potential
in international music?
The countries are becoming closer all
the time. When Australia and Europe
are next-door neighbors Australia could
become one of the great countries
musically. But Australia must then wake
up and become part of the world, and
not become self-satisfied.
I think that all countries which are
a little isolated tend to become self-
satisfied, think they have the best and
everything they have is good. This is
not so. Australia, musically, has given
a great deal to the world—but I’m sure
that it also has to take from the world
and learn from the world. It has been
a great exchange that Australian artists
have come to Europe and America and

they are wonderfully well received and
have great success. Now I think that
Australia should import great artists
from Italy, Germany, Austria, England,
America and all over the world and learn
from them.
Do you have any ambitions for your-
self and Miss Sutherland in Australia?
Australia is our home. I think we
would like to come out and live here
much more than we do. I don’t know
that I want to stay in any one city for
12 months of the year. I’ve lived so
much moving around that it has be-
come rather a habit. But I feel that we
would like to be part, eventually, of Aus-
tralia’s musical life and not just be
visitors once every five years. I very
much hope that this comes to pass.
Also, I feel that because we are ex-
perienced in so far as we have worked in
all the great theatres of the world, we
have a lot to teach Australians. I don’t
think that we should wait until we are
75 to begin doing it.
FILMS
Ahead of Knokke le Zoute
Sydney Film Festival
This 12th Sydney Film Festival is un-
doubtedly the best so far held and
not. because it happens to be the latest
of a gradually improving series. The
Festival has gone through several ups
and downs, but this year’s shows re-
markable improvement, not only in
quality and variety of films but in
general organisation.
Naturally, not every film shown is
a masterpiece, but almost all the ones
I saw had points of interest, with the
exception of Jacques Demy’s “Lola”,
which struck me as a total waste of 90
minutes. I did not even try to see every-
thing that was offering—even the most
dedicated fan can reach saturation point
—but a careful sampling provided me
with much pleasure and stimulation.
The high spots? “Seance On A Wet
Afternoon”, “The Collector” and “No-
body Waved Goodbye”, mentioned last
week, and perhaps the most striking,
Louis Malle’s “Le Feu Follet”. This
unforgettable film is the story of the
last two days in the life of an ageing
golden boy, now an alcoholic, who re-
visits his old friends in a desperate
attempt to find meaning in his life. It
is as moving and frightening a picture
of the disintegration of a human being
as is Arthur Miller’s “Death Of A Sales-
man”; in each case the destroyed man
has built his life on false premises and
now finds himself lost and abandoned.
Reticently directed and photographed
with a minimum of gimmickry, this is
a film of profound but unsentimental
compassion. Malle handles particularly
well the scenes in which Alain walks
as though invisible through the bustle
of Paris a remarkable evocation of
the isolation to be felt in a crowd of
people who all seem to have somewhere
to go, something to do. someone to
meet. In a film whose acting is
of uniformly high standard, Maurice
Ronet’s central performance is beyond
praise.
The magazine “Films And Filming”,
not the least charm of which is its
erratic proof-reading, described Teshi-
gahara’s “Woman In The Dunes” as “an
allergy of man’s fate”. An entomologist
hunting for specimens in the sand-dunes
is tricked by the local peasantry into a
deep pit in which lives a widow who
spends most of her time shovelling away
the sand which would otherwise engulf
both her and the village. I couldn’t
help asking myself awkward, philistine
questions: Could one woman really shift
enough sand to save the village, since
to judge by Segawa’s photography it is
rushing down like water over Niagara?
And what happens to it when she has
shovelled into those inadequate buckets?
It’s well acted and, of course, beauti-
fully photographed—l don’t think I ever
saw a Japanese film that wasn’t—but I
found it pretentious and arty.
Berlanga’s macabre comedy “El
Verdugo”, the story of a young Spaniard
forced by housing difficulties to become
the public executioner, remarkably
manages to be quite pleasantly enter-
taining for most of its length—partly
because of ingratiating acting, partly
because of the matter-of-fact Spanish
acceptance of the fact of death; but in
the final sequences, where the young
man is dragged bodily to perform his
first garrotting, it becomes a little too
realistic to be comfortable.
Unfortunately for his development as
a film-maker, Jean-Luc Godard very

early became the subject of a cult, with
the result that he has become alarmingly
self-indulgent about his casual tech-
nique and eccentric mannerisms. “Bande
a Part” has moments of interest and
charm, but its haphazard carelessness
and lack of discipline are a constant
irritation from a director who could do
so much better.
The standard of short films, par-
ticularly animated ones, has been high
during this Festival, and the organisers
have finally realised that you don’t need
or want half a dozen before each feature
fil' ll -
Of the animated shorts, Lenica’s
sinister, alarming “A” probably takes
first place, with its beautiful, clean
draughtsmanship and its Kafka - like
mood. In “The Hole”, John and Faith .
Hubley use the cartoon method for a
funny but basically serious discussion of
the possibility of nuclear war by
accident; the improvised dialogue is as
impressive as the use of line and color.
In a lighter mood, Wolfgang Urchs’
“Contraste” showed us a housewife who,
when given a modernistic ornament, re-
decorates her house and even her hus-
band to match, to find that the only
jarring note left is herself,
Murakami’s “The Insects”, with its
drawing simplified to the barest essen-
tials in the “Peanuts” style, is a small
masterpiece of lively humor,
Of the other short features, I remem-
ber with much pleasure “The Six-Sided
Triangle”, a witty and irreverent spoof
of different schools of filming Ingmar
Bergman gets a particularly rough
going-over which is delightfully per-
formed by. Sarah Miles, Nicol William-
son and Bill Meilen.
A very good Festival on the whole—-
though I think more opportunity could
be given for discussion groups or talks
from visiting film-makers. We were
promised a visit by the Indian director,
Satyajit Ray, who didn’t appear; how-
ever, this particular carrot has been
dangled in front of potential Festival
subscribers too often to be taken very
seriously.
Also, when do we start giving awards?
Almost every film in the Festival had
won an award from somewhere. One
even carried off the palm from a place
improbably named Knokke le Zoute. If
Knokke le Zoute can give prizes, why
not Sydney?

Angelic Singing
ABC Recital Series. Victoria de los Angeles.
Associate artist: Geoffrey Parsons, Syd-
ney.
Borodin Quartet. Musica Viva, Sydney.
The intelligently constructed programme
given by Miss de los Angeles on Wed-
nesday night was a lesson to any singer
in the-art of musical conservation. Each
half began with a group of more restrain-
ed works, then gathered momentum until
the ‘closing songs constituted a fully
dramatic statement. Through this con-
trolled expansion of range it was possible
to enjoy more of the individual qualities
which make Miss de los Angeles’ sing-
ing such a delight.
It was in the bracket of Schubert and
Schumann works that we first gained
an opportunity to examine her flawless
technique of expression. The particular
demands made by both words and music
were met with an unusual openness and
confidence in the reading. Schumann’s
“Widmung” was treated as a sustained
diminuendo, the assertive opening gradu-
ally dwindling away until it became a
wonderfully sensitive pianissimo. In
antithesis, “Ich Grolle Nicht”, the final
song before interval, rose from intro-
spective beginnings to a massive climax
in which, for the first time, we experi-
enced the full warmth and power .of this
amazingly flexible voice.
This same power, but now subdued so
as to become an undercurrent, lent a
special quality to the trio of Faure songs
which placed them as the centrepiece of
the programme. The deliberately sparse
texture of the music necessitates intense
expression within a delicate setting. The
sheer beauty of Miss de los Angeles’
voice, coupled with her perceptive inter-
pretation, made this section of the pro-
gramme a truly moving experience.
Using the common element of rhyth-
mic energy as a basis, Miss de los An-
geles created from the final group of
songs by Spanish composers a definite
and enjoyable musical whole. Ranging
from the vivacity of Granados’ gallant
lover to the quiet lullaby for the Negro
child by Montsalvatge, the group offers a
detailed selection of the changing moods
of the singer’s native country.
Perhaps the most attractive feature of
Miss de los Angeles’ style is her avoid-
ance of excessive vibrato. Too many
singers regard this device as an essential
part of aH voice production. By reserv-


The IBM Electric costs more...
or does it ?
Yes , , , and no. If you mean the actual purchase
price, the answer is yes. But, as every businessman
knows, a purchase price is only the first cost, not the
total cost. In typing, this total cost includes everything
necessary to provide a given amount of Work, and
here the IBM Electric proves its economy.
Have you ever calculated the total cost of a typing
station in your organization? In addition to the type-
writer itself, there is the typist's salary, cost of a
desk and chair, rent and other overheads, stationery
and supplies. Of the total cost, the typewriter is only
a small part (approximately 4%) yet the kind of
typewriter used can make a big difference.
ELECTRICITY MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. If you are
now using manual typewriters, the cost of each
typing station may be unnecessarily high because
the work cannot be turned out quickly enough. Extra
time is often consumed because some jobs have to
be typed twice to get the required number of read-
able carbon copies.
The Model 72 type-core.
With the IBM Electric, typing production increases*
as much as 20 per cent because electricity elim-
inates most of the manual labour. In addition, this,
typewriter provides up to 15 crisp, legible carbons
.., eliminating costly "double typing".
Since each typing assignment takes less time, Its
cost is, of course, reduced. And when the savings
are multiplied by thousands of typing assignments
over the year, they can be substantia!.
THE TREND IS TO ELECTRIC AS AN INVESTMENT,
NOT A COST. In addition to these easily-calculable
savings, the IBM Electric provides a less-tangibfS
but no less valuable benefit a new prestige and
impact with every letter you sign. The cost of an
|BM Electric can logically be classified as’ an
investment. ,
Call your local IBM office and ask our representative
to demonstrate in your own office how this superior
typewriter can help to keep your costs down. We
are confident you will be impressed.
Models for every application ? • The latest Model 72'
with interchangeable type head. Providing up to ,$
type faces. Fabric or carbon ribbon. Three carriage
lengths. • The Model 'C' standard. Unlimited type

ing her vibrato for climaxes and special
effects Miss de los Angeles is able to
employ it in the expressive manner for
which it was originally intended.
With the exception of the Scarlatti,
where he was far too loud, Mr Parsons
accompanied with both sensitivity and
grace.
The recital given by the Borodin String
Quartet saw a welcome return of what
seems to be a long-lost art musical
leadership. Present preoccupation with
equality has tended to make composers
write string quartets which give each
player an equal role. Unfortunately,
this has resulted in a decline of the pre-
stige associated with being the first
violinist, and as a consequence most
modern quartets are no longer actively
led. Evidence of the ill effects of this
practice can be found in recent record-
ings of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven
where the music, although technically
perfect, lacks the sparkle which energetic
leadership would have added.
Dubinski, leader of the Borodin, is
fortunately not a follower of current
musical fashions. Within the opening
few bars of Shostakovich's Quartet No 3
he had indicated in no uncertain manner
that there was only one leader in his
quartet. The work itself, with its heavy
classical overtones, places much of the
emphasis on the first violinist and the
effortless performance given by Dubin-
ski more than justified his traditional at-
titudes. Although the quartet played with
energy and precision it was powerless
to raise the last two movements from
their respective dullness and naivete. It
is a pity that Shostakovich could not
sustain the brilliance of the opening
movements.
Hindemith’s Third Quartet is more
democratic in its arrangement of parts,
the viola and ’cello having wonderful op-
portunities to display their ability. Both
these players have an extremely power-
ful tone and as a group functioned more
efficiently than did the first and second
violins. Nevertheless . the rapport be-
tween all four players is exceptionally
good and was especially noticeable in
the Stravinsky-influenced second move-
ment.

TELEVISION
Words and Music
Louise. Charpentier. ABC-TV.
Time was when opera enthusiasts begged
for their favorite works to be sung in
English. Wiser heads declared it better
to miss the significance of the libretto
and surrender to the music. As usual,
both were right. Some operas are fine
in English. But “Louise” is not one of
them. It might even be a bad influence
on some Australian composer, should
he decide to outdo Charpentier and
launch an opera with, shall we say,
scenes in a pub where stout-hearted
wharfies wave mugs of beer while the
leading tenor sings, “How are you, Joe,
how’s the Missus? And you, Bert, are
you working-ing-ing these days? Or still
on compo?”
There was much comparable to this
in the ABC’s production of “Louise”,
the story of a seamstress who elopes
from her possessive father and mother
to' live with an artist, returns to them
when her father is reported pining to
death for her, and finally escapes from
the parent trap close to the madness of
grief which is conventional in grand
opera. Not an entirely unbelievable
story, in a week when Ida Burza was
found, caged by her family for 18 years,
because of a youthful folly.
Stage opera is illusion standing on
the reality of its music. The materials
of the illusion are color, movement,
sweeping action from the principals, and
strong set designs which often create
an atmosphere rather than a pictorial,
representation. Television opera must
do without the color, and sweeping
movement would be ridiculous. The
illusion requires very different set
designs and much subtler acting, while
the voices must be toned to the micro-
phone, not flung to the “gods”.
The ABC’s production team did such
wonders that “Louise” is bound to raise
questions in the Drama Department and
among writers who are urged to limit
their settings. Either the opera had a
MARY O'BRIEN, Louise In Charpentier's
opera on ABC Television.
larger budget than any drama is allowed,
or it was a marvel of low-cost expertise.
Sets, design, dressing and lighting were
all close to perfection. From those
always too rapidly moving credits I noted
that Quentin Hole did the design, and
Peter Page the production and direction.
If there was a technical fault it was
in occasional audio imbalance. Louise
on the far balcony was properly more
faint than Julien nearer to camera, but
in duet their voices had the same blast-
ing level,, which caused my neighbors
to slam windows in chorus and do
tarantellas on the ceiling.
Was this production of “Louise”
successful, then? I can only answer,
no. It was a wonderfully mounted bore.
Frankly I used to get more enjoyment
from childhood’s tinny recordings and
the later radio programmes of opera, in-
cluding some local performances. One
did not have' a notion what they were
singing about, so could enjoy the music
and the voices; Perfect, clear diction is
rarely possible in grand opera. Hearing
familiar words one strains to catch them
all, and ends up with, “Is the soup
ready?” and “Yes”,, or “I love you”,
sung solo and duet until the triteness
becomes abominable.
These are minor quibbles. The big
one is that the whole of a minor opera,
visually pleasant but never exciting, has
too many dull, quiet periods for tele-
vision. On stage, these accent the
coming aria of a principal who will lift
you from your seat with sheer power
or brilliance. It cannot be done on TV
because such a blast would wake the
children and madden the neighbors. In
the home there is still much to be said for
radio’s old habit of giving the arias
with annotations.

COALS TO NEWCASTLE...
Heavy industry in Australia began at Newcastle, the great steel city of New
South Wales. The rich black coal of adjacent fields was the vital fuel for fur-
naces whose continuing clamour was the lusty voice of progress. Coals to New-
castle were the passwords to progress.
Today, on a vast and dramatic scale, the
Railways of Australia are taking coals to
many Newcastles from Leigh Creek to
Port Augusta, from Collie to Perth and
Fremantle, from Yallourn to Melbourne,
Corrimal to Port Kembla, Moura to Glad-
stone . . ore concentrates from Mt. Isa to
Townsville, from Broken Hill to Port Pirie
and to Cockle Creek, from Cobar to Port
Kembla . . . bauxite from Jarrahdale to
Kwinana. Soon the mile-long iron ore
trains will be rolling in Western Australia
from Koolyanobbing and Mt. Golds-
worthy and the Hamersley Ranges.
Coals to Newcastle? The ability of railways
to move bulk freights quickly, efficiently and
economically is of tremendous importance
to Australia. A strong, virile and integrated
railway system, at a time when other
nations are seeking our raw materials, is,
and remains the surest guarantee of our
future progress.

BOOK S
VIOLENCE
By DAVID MARTIN
Tlie Leper. Milovan Djilas. Methuen,
265. 6d.
The imprisonment of Djilas can be re-
gretted for many reasons. Not the least
important is that, as far as I know, it
reduces to two the number of first-rate
writers who are members of European
governments. They are Malraux and
C. P. Snow. Djilas, who is more of a
politician than either, has much in com-
mon with Malraux.
The similarities are quite striking.
Both feel that man’s destiny is tragic,
that death tests and rules life. Each
a man of action, their ultimate models
are the classics. Violence is what both
write about because they ha-ve closely
experienced it, and it is a fine question
who of the two, in the last analysis,
would regard it as more purposeless.
While, in their different ways, they see
it as inevitable and recognise the heroic
element, this, in Malraux, leads to stoic
acceptance and in Djilas to compassion
and pity. The Frenchman is now of all
partisans of statism the least plausible,
or at any rate the least convincing, and
the Serb is the most untypical Com-
munist of his age. Is he still a Com-
munist at all?
It must seem strange to discuss him
in such terms, since his literary output
is so slight, but it is not extravagant. If
Djilas were not famous as a revolution-
ary and rebel—two things eternally
irreconcilable this book should make
him so. On all counts this is an out-
standing collection; the breath of life
blows through it like a gale.
Many critics will concentrate on the
name-piece. They will certainly see in
it the tale of Djilas’ own spirit and
sufferings, as when they looked into the
eyes of Zhivago and saw the soul of
Pasternak. I hope it will not monopolise
their interest, for, masterly as it is,
there are others which are as good.
“The Leper” tells of Lazar, a peasant
and a singer, whom his fellows, overawed
by the village tyrant, wall into his hut,
inch by inch, shutting out love and com-
munion but not the message of his song.
Frightening in the meticulous severity
of its detail, grand in sweep and con-
ception, it could well be one of the
noblest stories written in a 20th century
gaol. Todor, the oppressor, always acts
“for the good of the people”, which
happens to coincide with what is good
for himself. It all takes place during
the Austrian occupation, and the moun-
tain folk, among them Lazar’s blood
brother, one by one submit to him and
quieten their consciences. One friend,
an outlaw, breaks through to where
Lazar rots away. He has come to learn
where a cache of arms is hidden, and
Lazar conquers his sorrow as he under-
stands that pure friendship is rare between
mortals. The march of the doomed leper
to his last home, which I would compare
to Sergeant Grisha’s walk with his
executioners in Arnold Zweig’s novel;
the gradual surrender of the villagers to
the seduction of fear and order; the un-
adorned immediacy of the narrative and
the weight of the atmosphere from start
to finish, these make the story as nearly
flawless as it could be.
Perhaps the best thing about it is how
it combines place and face, earth and
community. (The young Tolstoy of the
Caucasus years will come to mind.)
There is a story, “Woods and Waters”,
where the author relates a homecoming
to his native forests and rivers, already
a wanted man. A shepherd is to guide
him through the night to a secret rendez-
vous with local conspirators. They meet,
accidentally, three fishermen - poachers,
and the life of each is\ set before us
before the hero himself succumbs to the
lure of nets and rods, with the police
not far away. On a lesser scale this has
the strength and freshness of “The
Leper”; the same blending of nature and
man, but lyrical and without terror.
It would be wrong, though, to imply
that Milovan Djilas is a kind of Yugoslav
Sadoveanu, much as they have in com-
MILOVAN DJILAS
mon in theme and inspiration. His
stories about the last war and the civil
war could not have been written by any-
one else. A few are Goyaesque in their
brutal starkness and their refusal to let
sentiment speak for the eye. The best-
known of all, “War”, describes a river
crossing and a farmer couple taking a
coffin from one bank to the other on
an army ferry. They bewail the death
of their son. But it is against custom
to bury him in a coffin in the rear; an
officer has it opened and the living youth
is discovered—and shot on the spot as
a deserter. Now the old man and his
woman may dig him a grave . . . “The
lieutenant said: ‘Funny people, these
peasants; they are wailing now just as
they did before’.”
“The Execution” is about a good-look-
ing young soldier who is noted for his
businesslike but humane way of des-
patching hostile snoopers, until the story-
teller (again recognisably Djilas) finds
out that he shoots them just below the
brain, so that “he must feel his death,
the son of a bitch!”
This one is but a cruel vignette. An-
other in the bracket goes far beyond
it. “The Foreigner” brings together two
comrades and a girl. Her lover has from
childhood tried, and failed, to establish
some sort of intimacy with the second
man, an intellectual, once more bearing
the writer's features. The front seems to
build them a bridge. Then the woman,
a student, falls in the hands of the
Italians, allows herself to be befriended
by one of their doctors and eventually
is tried for co-operating with the .in-
vaders. Her lover shoots her, becomes
an alien to himself and, in a subtle way,
to the other fighters. He is rejected by

The Scapegoats
By NANCY KEESING
The Reckoning. Hugh Atkinson. Bodley
Head. 21s.
Among the Cinders. Maurice Shadbolt.
Whitcombe & Tombs. 255. 6d.
“I always see I don’t know why,
If any person’s going to die.
That’s why nobody talks to me . . ”
L. A. G. STRONG
The superficially obvious reason for re-
viewing them as a pair is that a police
hunt is central to the action of both,
although the circumstances of the hunt
are quite different in each book, and so
are the mood and approach. Much more
valid parallels are that Shadbolt and
Atkinson share an arbitrary approach to
the fates of characters and-each writer
uses atypical people as scapegoats.
From the early pages of Hugh Atkin-
son’s book it was perfectly clear to me
(though I am not sure the author
intended such a quick guess), that the
Rabbit, a likeable fellow of low-grade
intelligence, was cast for the role of
scapegoat. Until the events outlined in
“The Reckoning”, the Rabbit had cheer-
fully been a butt, a figure both of fun
and of occasional, clumsy compassion.
Already (through the trickery of his
marriage) he was a dump for collective
guilt. That he was not unhappy, that
his marriage turned out successfully and
his wife grew fond none of these
things lends him safety, in his small Blue
Mountains community in 1932.
The coal-mining town is still, then,
an isolated, rather self-sufficient place
when, one morning, a woman is mur-
dered and a Polish immigrant farm-
hand is discovered to have taken to the
hills. The Pole’s guilt is immediately
assumed and feeling runs high. A posse
is formed to search for the Pole and it
is, from the outset, clear that every man
in that posse is bound to suffer in one
way or another during the manhunt. As
the blurb well puts it, they will ‘‘discover
that it is each man’s own haunts that are
being hunted, the ghost of each man’s
ruined life that is being stalked”. The
Rabbit, posse member by accident, has
an emotional crisis different from those
of the other men: “On the mountain,
when the image of the young kangaroo’s
body had confused with his son’s and
the dam of his memory had broken, in
a dim and disjointed poignancy the
Rabbit had realised his place and begun
to understand the mockery of his person
which he had permitted and endured
It would be unfair to disclose the
precise events which end the manhunt—
within the taut framework of this stylish
book they are convincing enough. But
despite the logic of the novel I find
Rabbifs fate far too pat. And are we
supposed to recognise true profundity in
his final speech to his wife? (“No, I can’t
let them fergive me. That would make
it all for nuthin’. It would put me in
the wrong if I let them fergive me.”)
Should scapegoats be rabbits? It is
highly fashionable at present to make
them so—whether the fashion began in
the American south (Welty, Capote,
McCullers) or in Europe, I do not know
but once sacrifices had to be un-
blemished, perfect . . .
Shadbolt’s narrator is far from
feeble-minded; he is a ready-made victim
in a different way altogether, for this is
a more complicated book. Nicky is a
New Zealand youth and before his year
of adventure begins he is already victim
of his well-meaning, rather pusillanimous
parents. Only Nick’s wonderfully
eccentric grandfather perceived his
need.
Together the boy and the old man, in
very moving circumstances which the
lacl does not quite understand, embark
on a picaresque journey symbolic for
each of them, in which they visit the
scenes of Grandfather Flinders’ youth
and pioneering gold-seeking, digging
for gum, tree-felling; the boy discover-
ing matters of importance for his own
life, the man only saved from utter dis-
illusionment by his powerful and idio-
syncratic view of life. The police hunt
for them begins because grandfather has
made sure that nobody knows where
they are but Nick has some reason for
guilty fears and believes himself to be
the target of a genuine manhunt.
It is ironical that, from a writer of
Shadbolt’s unquestionable maturity and
skill comes this book which, if sum-
marised down to its bones would yield
the outline of a classic boys’ adventure
tale. Its conclusion, with grandfather

settled happily in the only environment
where his rich peculiarities might be not
only accepted, but appreciated (in the
household of Nick’s “second family”—
his Maori friends), presents the insouciant
fortuity of juvenile fiction. And the
irony is emphasised because Shadbolt
has labored to prevent fortuitous effects,
and to this end has introduced several
devices which are innovatory. For in-
stance, like a religious painter whose
self-portrait appears in the corner of a
crowded canvas, Shadbolt enters the
book in person towards the end, and
remains on stage as Nick’s amanuensis
thereafter. Nick’s scholarly brother who
has been kept ignorant of a certain event
throughout the book (but who of course
will read it on publication) is shown the

novel has little room for humor —Shad-
bolt’s more expansive work is often truly
comic and never more so than when he
satirises Nick’s brother: poet and univer-
sity lecturer:
“Derek had taken his freshly printed
book of poems out to Grandfather
Flinders’ place . . . one of the poems was
dedicated to Grandfather Flinders . . .
You who shared the land’s eager
rape
Opening valleys like thighs
Through passionate days which rang
with blade
Stripping green garments
Through sensual nights which sang
with flame
To lie your head on a blackened
breast;
and a lot more of the same. Well, the
old boy wasn’t too much impressed . . .
Fie instructed Derek to get hold of a
garden fork, and made him dig potatoes
all day.’’
Neither “Among the Cinders” nor
“The Reckoning” is claimed as based on
actual occurrences. Both might well
have been—and here one returns to my
initial remarks about arbitrariness. In
each book with exactly the same plot
and characters the interpretation could
have been quite different. Even the
emphasis might have been entirely
altered, because only the action is
organic and neither author succeeds in
lending his work the final persuasion of
abolute inevitability.

This much-needed book is further evi-
dence that the Victorian universities are
becoming the centres of real attempts at
scholarship about the foundation years.
There are many lapses as to fact, but
no doubt in future editions these will
come to be corrected. Perhaps the worst
of them is the assertion that “few of
the men whom convict women took as
husbands appeared to be well to do
or landed proprietors”. It depends on
what is meant by “husbands”, and there
were very few men of the class

all the year round
described as “landed proprietors” up to
the year of the beginning of free
immigration. Despite Dr Robson’s asser-
tion, nearly all the first generation of
the “gentlemen of New South Wales”,
of whom such “very strange tales” were
told, stemmed from convict mothers
the Johnstons, the Lawsons, the first
Piper family, the Reibys, and many
more.
In designing the revision of the quali-
fications for the Pioneers’ Club with
Sir Victor Windeyer, some years ago,
I made a very close study of relation-
ships and found that round 1825 there
was very little of the population, great
or lowly, which did not have convict
blood in it somewhere, whether through
convict mothers or fathers, or through
the daughters and sons of convicts.
Furthermore, I found a great deal to
qualify the judgment accepted from the
dicta of the times, that (as Dr Robson,
and I before then, have put it): “the
female prisoners had little to recommend
them”, and that the “Irish women
appeared to be the best of a bad lot”.
There was certainly a very noticeable
leaven of real badness but a very large
proportion began to be debauched only
in the enforced promiscuity of life in
convict ships.
And the purest of women, who did
not immediately acquire the safeguard
of influential male protection, through
marriage or otherwise, had little chance
to escape being debauched in a com-
munity which, in the time of Governor
King in 1804, had a population of 4088
males, including 1922 convicts and 568
“licentious soldiery” and only 1365
women, of whom 601 were convicts.
How could the poor devils fail to
become depraved in such a community,
especially under a drunken governor
who gave little attention to their wel-
fare, however he might profess to be
sedulous? Yet virtuous and good mothers
many of them were, and ancestresses of
many notable Australians.
But with all its faults, Dr Robson’s
book is a good basis for study of the
convict system, with very little in it that
cannot be corrected and with sound and
copious statistical and other appendices.
High-class Lunatic?
By WILLIAM GINNANE
The Universal Design of Creation. Francis
J. Mott. Mark Beech. £5 ss.
Every now and then you come across a
book which does more than give you
pause; it positively, even if only for a
moment, sets you reeling back waiting
for the world to stop spinning. Such, I
must confess, was the effect on me of
Francis J. Mott’s massive piece of cos-
mology - ct/m-sociology-czr/u-psychology-
cz//77-embryology-cMA7i . . . Even now,
however, I cannot say that it is not the
work of some kind of high-class lunatic.
Mott’s basic idea is that the whole of
the natural universe in all its aspects,
mental as well as physical, reveals a
certain basic configurational pattern.
Once this pattern is understood it can,
he thinks, be used in two ways first,
to serve as a basic conceptual framework
in terms of which any phenomenon un-
der study may be analysed and described;
secondly, to explain the evolutionary
origin of the phenomenon in question.
This may seem reasonable; the idea is
not inept. The trouble is that it is really
so general and vague that it has no par-
ticular explanatory or predictive value
whatsoever, or precious little anyway.
It is, of course, really quite an old idea.
The other feature of the supposed con-
figurational design of creation is rather
more fanciful. This involves the sugges-
tion that Reality occurs in patterns of
four progressive units in such a way that
the fourth unit of one configuration is
identical with the first unit of another
“ thus § ivin S rise to compound patterns
° f se^ n unite.-Again, Mott sees this pat-
tern displayed m all sorts of phenomena,
Of course if it does turn out to be
even just a little bit true then it is of no
little importance. In fact, it would mark
th® point of departure for a whole new
branch, or even dimension, of science,
It would create a scientific concept link-
in § the P h y sical such as P h y sics

on the other. It would subsume them all
unc (er a single specific mode of explana-
tion what we might term Mottian
Configurationalism. Such syncretic
dreams have been dreamed before, and
on occasion by genuine scientists. Some

Caste
By EMERY BARCS
Aristocracy and the Middle-Class in Ger-
many. Social Types in German Literature,
1830-1900. Ernest K. Bramsted. The
University of Chicago Press. 525. 6d.
Professor Bramsted, Reader in History
at the University of Sydney, uses Ger-
man literature in the 19th century as a
vehicle for analysing the struggle for
power, influence and social status be-
tween the feudal German aristocracy and
the rising middle classes during that
period. This was the era in which Ger-
many developed from a loosely related
association of mainly agrarian States
into a united nation and a first rate
industrial power. The chief promoters
of this transformation were middle-class
businessmen whom the German aristo-
cracy tried to hold back by its stiff caste-
consciousness and rejection of the “up-
starts”.
By dissecting the work of German
writers, Professor Bramsted has thrown
light on the origins of German political
and social attitudes which eventually
made Hitler possible. One hopes that
he will follow up this book with another
one showing us Germany through the
works of 20th century German novelists.

A purple starfish. We saw towards night
That frightful bonfire of planet-wither-

The holy sun, go under the waves. I did
Sleep, though, for half the afternoon
On a rug beside my daughter. It was
good
To lie down like a boulder. To lie down.
No kiss of fire, no strung harp in the
breast,
To grow old is to let all past years rest
In the mind of God, by having nothing

Enough, and lie down in one's own grave.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Markets in Focus
TS/hen share markets turn down after
a period of prolonged rises, it is
customary to kick the cat and blame
everyone except the people who claim
that markets always go up, never down.
It has been stressed here in these
columns, ever since the previous Aus-
tralian Budget, that there was justifica-
tion for an adjustment. The drought,
of course, has underscored local think-
ing.
But the major external causes from
overseas remain the same and these in-
fluences have affected overseas markets
as well.
The principal reason for the continued
buoyancy of Wall Street was the skilful
opposition to hard money policies by
the Johnson Administration, combined
with two imaginative tax cuts which kept
the economy (and corporation profits)
rolling along.
Today, looking for reasons for the
fall in Wall Street and the consequent
psychological effect on other Exchanges,
there should be no discovery of un-
expected causes. The pressure on foreign
exchange and Britain’s economic dif-
ficulties should have been well enough
known.
To blame Mr W. McChesney Martin,
Federal Reserve Board chairman, for his
comment that the present American
boom had overtones of 1929 is to toss
aside all the educated thinking on
managed economies since that era. But
it does prove one point which invariably
should be kept in perspective. Emotional
attitudes and psychological fears can
never be removed from investment,
speculation, and business planning.
President Johnson countered the
“gloom and doom” fear by plonking a
silent, subdued Mr Martin next to him
at a Press conference and proceeding
to inform the world that stock prices
were not too high in relation to corpora-
tion profits and that he and his advisers
saw no reason for anything but good
hopes for the rest of 1965.
The guideline of stock market prices,
maintained at a level of around 19 times
earnings, has been watched carefully by
the Administration as well as investors.
President Johnson’s moves to provide
tax cuts at the right time have kept
profits on the rise and so justified market
attitudes of paying 19 times earnings.
As a result, the Dow Jones Averages
broke through the 900 barrier and the
analysts freely predicted that the 1000
mark would be breached.
It was obvious, however, after a
record peacetime boom, that some
nervousness must develop among in-
vestors who worried about the time when
profits did not keep pace with the market
especially those people who bought
shares on credit by use of the “margin”
system.
When Mr Martin made mention of
the 1929 era, therefore, the nervous
holders could hardly be blamed for try-
ing to play safe.
Yet there were other factors. Fear of
an escalation of the war in Vietnam
brought in a wave of sellers, a strange
contradiction for Wall Street, which has
always been afraid of what peace would
do to a market strongly reliant on
defence stocks.
The “tremendous"' fall in prices was
not as great as it appeared. When the
Dow Jones Averages dropped into the
860 s from their May 14 all-time peak
of 939.62, it represented a monthly fall
of about 7 p.c. A 10 p.c. fall would
represent almost 94 points of the index
and would take it down to 845.66, at
which point the “Mr Hatch” theorists
would tend to quit the market.
Under the Hatch system they would
be committed to buy back in again after
the market has risen 10 p.c. If the
market doesn’t fall too far, however,
and recovers by 10 p.c., they would be
very strong supporters of the market at
W. McCHESNEY MARTIN
Chairman, US Federal Reserve Board.
a price higher than they sold. Expressed
in figures, this means that if the index
fell to 840 and then recovered 10 p.c.,
the Hatch men would be selling out at
levels between 845 and 840 and buying
again at 924.
It takes all kinds to make a market,
and there are countless “systems”. So
the President’s admonitions are not going
to stop the bulk of the people from buy-
ing or selling, if they feel like it.
It is as well to keep everything in
perspective, both the figures which are
there to sustain confidence and the
personal feelings and circumstances of
the public.
Into the latter category come those
who are personally affected by drought
conditions in six continents.
British and American Share Markets
British and American share
markets finished last week still
fully under the influence of the
economic and psychological factors
outlined in the article above. They
provided little sign of encouraging
the tenuous recovery on Australian
markets, and New York, in particular,
may have an over-emphatic effect
locally.
London naturally struggles doubly
with continuously disappointing trade
figures and a renewed battering of
sterling on the foreign exchanges.
Overall prices went temporarily be-
neath the year’s low on Friday, avoid-
ing this point by a hair’s breadth at
the close. The “Financial Times”
index ended at 327.8, against March
19's lowest point of 327.4.
Volumes are at their lightest for
four years. All equity sections seem
to be taking the knock from repeated
small selling. Good indicators like
Unilever, British Motor Corporation,
Dunlop, Vickers and Courtaulds all
went back.
Wall Street saw some strikingly
hectic trading which, however, did
not permit a bright rally on Tuesday
to be sustained for very long. Con-
spicuously swelling dealings gave rise
to Friday profit-taking,
Some European experts are re-
luctant to blame London and Wall
Street behavior on any general world
situation, though they give a measure
of support to tackling reform of the
international monetary system. Swiss
bankers have warned against carrying
deliberately disinflationary policies
too far.


Closer to home, the prospect of higher
taxes, reduced incomes and a question
mark over export prospects for 1965-66
are real factors to consider.
Knocks in May
T>ritain’s sharp intake of imports in
May prompted some hand-wring-
ing in Britain and caused some con-
sternation to those European bankers
who are anxiously watching their stand-
by loans to Britain.
Balance of payments figures showed
that May’s deficit on visible trade jumped
by £stg!9m. to £stg49m., the worst
month since November.
This was caused by a rise in imports
of £stg24m. to £stgsolm. as shippers
took advantage of the reduction in the
15 p.c. import surcharge to 10 p.c. on
April 27. Shipments had been held back
in anticipation of the lower duty.
The big problem now is whether the
rate of imports will be maintained and
so offset the export drive which Britain
is making in an effort to close the trade
gap-
On the manufacturing front, British
industry says that it welcomes the recent
cut in Bank Rate. But the latest survey
of the Federation of British Industries
in May indicates that members who
replied to the FBI business questionnaire
are less optimistic than they were four
months ago. On the export side, how-
ever, the three or four hundred business-
men questioned said they were as
optimistic as they were previously.
Twice Times Steel
\ Japanese reply to New South Wales’
blithe invitation to establish a steel
industry in the State, from scratch, was
not long in coming. The NSW Minister
for Mines, Mr T. L. Lewis, who light-
heartedly extended the offer, did not
have much of a wait to learn the facts
of steel, and economic, life.
Japan’s Commercial Consul in Sydney,
Mr N. Amaya, made the usual flattering
comments on BHP’s position, suggesting
that the Australian market would be
amply and efficiently supplied by that
company. He also straightforwardly
drew attention to the prevailing economic
climate in Japan, which involves both
internal and balance-of-payments prob-
lems.
A sense of Australian responsibility
in flying kites about a second steel in-
dustry should be pinpointed on two
crucial elements, at least. The siting is
far from a matter of a wish for any
single State ascendancy and at present
the generally tight labor situation effec-
tively blocks a quick start.
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Government Expenditure
Takes the Cake
The alternatives to tax increases
/Canberra is certainly a glutton for
money. Of course, nobody has any
right to complain about being bled for
money for defence purposes. Everybody
should be right behind the Treasurer on
that count, if only because, by general
admission, Australia’s defences leave
much to be desired. But, quite apart
from defence expenditure, which is
estimated to rise by something like £9O
million next year, Mr Holt apparently
sees an increase of £l6O million in other
Federal spending. About £36 million of
this is already earmarked for increases
in grants to the States. So, if we put
down £24 million for additional capital
expenditure on Federal account, we are
left with a £lOO million increase in
spending for general purposes.
On the historic occasion of the
“horror” Budget fifteen years ago, the
Government was flayed for its extrava-
gance in boosting expenditure above
£lOOO million for the first time. That
H. HOLT
was shortly after Sir Roland Wilson took
the helm at the Treasury. Since then
(1951-52), Sir Roland has presided over
an increase in spending from the Con-
solidated Revenue Fund from £lOl6
million to last year’s £lB7l million and
this year’s estimated £2085 million. As
Mr Holt said in Brisbane that most of
the £250 million extra he wants for the
Treasury next year “would be mainly
derived from taxation”, it looks as if
spending from Consolidated Revenue
(which, of course, excludes loan alloca-
tions to the States and also any current
expenditure charged to the loan fund,
say, for defence, the Mt Isa project,
Snowy Mountains Authority, and so on)
will rise to something like £2400 million.
Now nobody who knows Sir Roland
would say he is an extravagant man
certainly not the many departmental
heads whose estimates have been ruth-
lessly sawn in his carpenter's shop over
the years. Yet even discounting for the
30 p.c. increase in consumer prices over
the period, that rise of £l4OO million
in fourteen years (about 10 p.c. average
a year) reflects an enormous rise in the
cost of government. In the last five years
the increases in expenditure from con-
solidated revenue have been (in £
millions) 200, 3, 44, 214, 213 (estimated
for 1964-65). Next year’s could beat the
highest of these increases by a consider-
able margin.
On looking at this string of figures,
it could be suspected that even Sir
Roland, with his great economic ex-
pertise, might have reservations about
the effectiveness of the Treasury in keep-
ing expenditure down in years when the
economy can do with a helping hand
from Government spending (as in 1961-
62 and 1962-63, when the rises were
only £3 million and £44 million respec-
tively). What must be even more dis-
turbing for economic management is
that, in the boom years (like the last
two and 1960-61, when the rises were
£2OO million or more, not to speak of
the coming year), the Treasury appears
to have lost hold of the reins of its
spending altogether.
Possibly all this is not so much the
fault of Sir Roland as of his political
masters, whose spending reactions in
recessions and booms follow closely
those of the madding crowd. In reces-
sions their expansive hormones are
damped,, while in booms they are given
full vent. So we come to the point
that in this buoyant period, when
defence should be claiming the spotlight
of spending and other political acts
relegated to the wings, we find one par-
ticular diversion in the spending of
public money well in the centre of the
Federal stage. I refer to the reserve


price scheme for wool, which is reckoned
to require anything up ro £5O million
or more from Treasury sources.
One disturbing aspect of building up
claims like this on the public purse in
periods when the economy is highly
buoyant is that no allowances seem to
be made for contingencies, such as war
or drought. The presumption is that,
come fine or foul economic weather,
they can all be met. Though a moment’s
reflection on defence needs alone, not
to speak of the ravages of drought which
threaten to reduce export income by
something like one-sixth next year,
should be dictating the utmost caution
and not simply bland statements such
as we had from the Treasurer last week
that, to meet Canberra’s unbridled ex-
penditure in all directions, the com-
munity will have to cough up something
like an extra £250 million in taxation.
The Treasurer seems to hold the view
that the private sector is a sort of
inexhaustible well of funds to service
Canberra’s needs. He should be warned,
however, that, if he goes bald-headed
with his intention to raise an additional
£250 million in taxation next year, he
will be inviting the very inflation which
he has succeeded in containing, so far, in
this cycle.
Some of the signs are already on the
wall, others are but symptoms. Most
apparent are the dangers arising from the
fairly-rapid drawing down of overseas
reserves. The ample cushion in these,
which has allowed the running of a
record level of imports to feed the
buoyant economy over the last year, has
been deflated to the point from which
the envisaged declines in exports and
capital inflow next year will entail cutting
back imports and so removing what has
up to this been the most effective buffer
against inflation.
It is equally clear that the narrow
profit margins over a wide range of
industry, within which additional taxation
would have to be accommodated, are
most vulnerable to possible further cost
increases. I have argued up to this that
inflation is more threatening from the
costs side than from excessive effective
demand. This still seems to be the case.
Within the next three weeks (rumor has
it), we shall have the basic wage
judgment. If this is for another rise,
the profit margins of a large number of
firms could well disappear in default of
prices being increased. Additional taxa-
tion would only exacerbate the position
and have inflationary effects.
Not so obvious to the general public,
perhaps, is the subtle change which has
been occurring in recent months in the
propensity to save, as evidenced by dis-
investment in savings bank deposits and,
from figures this week, in the failure of
this to be compensated by increases in
fixed deposits in the trading banks. Up
to May, fixed deposits had gone some
way in offsetting the weaker trend of
savings bank deposits. But in that month,
fixed deposits rose by only £450,000 (the
savings bank figures for May are not
yet issued).
It seems impossible to escape the con-
clusion that inflationary pressures seem
likely to rise from now on, under the
double impact of increased taxation and
wages on industrial costs, in a setting
where productive resources are fully
employed and a reduced level of imports
could be forced on the economy for
balance-of-payments reasons. To those
who point to the build-up of stocks
shown by the latest national accounts as
a mitigating factor in the situation, it
seems reasonable to say two things. One
is that imports consist mainly of pro-
ducer goods, equipment and raw
materials, and only to a small extent of
consumer goods. Secondly, the stocks of
these goods may still continue to rise for
a time, and have an anti-inflationary
effect; this may not last for more than
another six months or so.
Of course, it can be argued that a rise
in the basic wage would assist the general
public to maintain its spending, and so
reduce the need to draw on savings
to maintain living standards. However,
the Treasurer cannot have it both ways.
If, as is suggested in Canberra, he is
going to increase income tax by five p.c.,
this in itself is going to put a hole ; n
any additional increment to wages
awarded by the Arbitration Commission.
In the meantime, the economy should
continue to reflect the Treasury’s own
squeeze on liquidity, whose repercus-
sions, so far, have been more apparent
in the £9B million increase in trading
bank advances in the last two months,
and the general rise in interest rates,
than in any marked easing in economic
activity. For the next few months we
may well see a further easing of the
labor market and some reduction in
production in some industries. If this
happens, it could well increase inflation-
ary pressures, particularly if the
Treasurer carries out his present Budget
intentions and in the interim the Arbitra-
tion Commission increases wages.
This column has said before in the
last six months that the Government
should make an early start in cutting its
own coat to the reduced cloth of re-
sources likely to be available to the
economy next year. Obviously, it has
turned against such a course, despite the
more patent signs that resources are
going to be sharply reduced and the
tasks of defence so much greater. It is
no answer simply to turn to the private
sector to pull up a few additional
buckets of taxation. What is needed is
a searching examination of the whole
field of Government expenditure, in an
effort to cut out the dead wood.

Mr Snedden and His Critics
Further debate on restrictive practices
Trade Practices Bill may be a best
seller, as is reported from Canberra.
Yet apart from the Press comment im-
mediately after its appearance and the
Ministers second reading speech, sur-
prisingly little has been heard from the
public. This may- be because the Bill
is a very much watered-down version
of the original Barwick proposals and
relief is being expressed in grateful
silence. Or it may simply be because,
after the second reading speech, the Bill
has been left hanging in the wind. At
least one employers’ organisation is
girding its loins for further representa-
tions against the Bill.
Going on a TV interview in Mel-
bourne last week, Mr Snedden is still
very sensitive on some of the points
recently raised on the Bill by The
Bulletin. One of these concerns the
provision that the register of agreements
is not to be open for public inspection.
The Attorney-General is really adamant
about making the register open only to
the Commissioner. His point is that
these multilateral or horizontal agree-
ments could have a confidential quality
which the parties to them have the right
to have conserved unless the agreements
work to the detriment of the public
interest or, in the opinion of the Com-
missioner, deserve public examination
in the tribunal.
While still unsatisfactory in my view,
this proposition makes a little more sense
now in the light of Mr Snedden’s further
assurance on television that the tribunal
will only go into secret session in ex-
ceptional circumstances. As we have
held all along, if secret sessions are not
to become the rule rather than the ex-
ception, the Bill must be greatly stiffened
to ensure that this is what will happen.
Mr Snedden explained to television
viewers that the holding of secret sessions
would be confined to occasions when
secret processes and the like were under
discussion. This is good to hear and we

Mr Snedden was also tackled on the
absence of provision for public complaint
being made on trade practices to the
proposed authority. He admitted frankly
that the Bill made no tacit provision
for this, but in a rambling passage he
gave the assurance that the public would
be able to complain against practices to
the authority by letter, through members
of Parliament, and so on. This is also
nice to know, though obviously it would
be advisable to lay down the possible
channels in the legislation itself. Pre-
sumably this will now be done. Until
we alerted the Minister to the absence
of any such provision he had neglected
to consider it.
Another question along Bulletin
lines asked how many members were
envisaged for the tribunal. As we sus-
pected, it will not be just a question
of a handful of members. Mr Snedden
explained that the tribunal could in fact
be hearing cases in all corners of the
Commonwealth at the same time. So
that while each case would be heard by
a presidential member in company with
two additional members deputed for
their business and other relevant experi-
ence, at any one time there could
possibly be a host of presidential mem-
bers and double the number of non-
presidential members in the pay of the
authority.
This is what we feared at the start.
Indeed, Mr Snedden’s octopus could
well grow in other directions, because at
this stage one gets a picture that a single
Commissioner's job is to sort out the
practices and agreements put before him
to determine which of them are suspect
enough for an open inquiry by the
tribunal. But will the Commissioner be
simply one person dodging about the
Commonwealth like a Secretary-General
of the United Nations investigating the
trouble spots around the world?
It is at least conceivable that, once
the Commissioner gets his fingers in a
doubtful looking trade pie, he could
have little time to look into others. Thus
we have the prospect looming up of
Deputy Commissioners and the multi-
plication of staff on Parkinson lines. If
the prevalence of doubtful trade practices
is common enough to warrant the intro-
duction of such all-embracing legislation,
surely such visions of a mounting
bureaucracy arising from the Bill are
not a mere figment of the imagination.
Another aspect to raise the eyebrows
of the legal representative on the panel
was the unpalatable procedure in the
Bill by which not only are decisions
of the quasi-legal tribunal enforceable
in the Industrial Court, but also failure
to abide by rulings of the tribunal is
to be regarded as contempt of the In-
dustrial Court. This treading on legal
toes could well have been avoided if the
Minister had given the tribunal full
judicial status, as seems to have been
the original intention. As Mr Snedden
explained that non-presidential members
would have the same voting power in
the tribunal’s decisions as presidential
members and need have no legal quali-
fications at all, there is a rub for the
Law Institute in this.
Another legal luminary, Professor
J. E. Richardson, Law Dean at the
National University, who early on while
agreeing generally with the contents of
the Bill said Mr Snedden had not gone
far enough in some directions (such as
by not including bilateral practices and
not making services practices registrable),
is now saying he believes in some re-
spects the Bill goes too far in that certain
sections seemed likely to fall foul of
Section 51 (20) of the Constitution. In
a word, he doubts whether the High
Court will support the Commonwealth’s
intention to act under its Constitutional
powers to make laws governing foreign
corporations or trading or financial
corporations formed within Common-
wealth boundaries. Professor Richardson
has pointed out that this power has not
previously been a source of the exercise
of Commonwealth control of corpora-
tions, though he admits that, since the
first case was tried and lost in 1909 when
the Commonwealth attempted to use it,
the High Court has taken a more liberal
view of Commonwealth powers in some
commercial fields.
So far as I know, Professor Richard-
son has not yet expressed a view on the
Constitutional position of the legislation
as a whole, but only on certain sections
of it dealing, primarily, with the out-
lawed practices, collective tendering and
collective bidding—that is, those mainly
under Section 35 of the Bill.
If the sovereignty of the States still
means anything, the effectiveness of the
new legislation, which purports to replace
the Australian Industries Preservation
Act (which will be repealed) with
stronger and more embracing measures
against monopoly and other trade prac-
tices to safeguard the public interest,
will depend to a great extent on whether
the State Governments pass complement-
ary legislation. It is sometimes stated
that the watering of the Barwick pro-
posals was designed to placate the fears
of some of the States, notably Victoria,
and so get their compliance. However,
Victoria with its ten-year-old Liberal
Government, or NSW, the biggest in-
dustrial State, with its new Liberal
Government, have yet to show their
hands. Neither of these States are cer-
tainties, nor are Western Australia and
Queensland. On the other hand, Tas-
mania and South Australia, both with
Labor Governments, will presumably
pass any necessary legislation, which
in Tasmania’s case could go considerably
further than Snedden's Bill.
In these circumstances, with some
States falling in line and others not, the
Snedden legislation would presumably
not be effective against companies
operating only in States where no com-
plementary legislation has been passed.
In cases where interstate companies
were involved, it seems impossible to
project what the position would be.

Uncertainty Over the Land
Real estate and livestock auctioneers gloomy
M/'ith no visible sign of the drought
breaking in NSW, a stiff Budget
expected in August, generally difficult
economic conditions and heavy defence
and National Service commitments,
auctioneers of both real estate and live-
stock are preparing to tighten their belts
and ride out some troubles.
Real estate and livestock are two
totally different saleable commodities,
yet there is a striking inter-relation be-
tween the two. The real estate dealer
keeps his eye on what is happening in
the country and the livestock auctioneer
uses city dealings as a guide to what
the future may hold for him. Both are
old - established barometers of the
economic climate. Their current prog-
nostications are far from heartening.
In real estate, for instance, at both
the commercial, industrial and residen-
tial levels there is a comparative lull in
business at present. It would appear,
from discussions The Bulletin had
with real estate auctioneers, that it will
become increasingly difficult to sell
property, partly because of the high
prices being asked and partly because of
tighter money-lending policies.
The real estate auctioneers have no
illusions that a severe drop-off in business
could follow the Budget. Some are
more optimistic about the severity of the
“slump” than others. One auctioneer
said he expected conditions to be similar
to those existing during the credit
squeeze, whBTT his revenue fell 30 p.c.
He estimates an average fall of 25 p.c.
through all sectors of real estate dealings.
Another pointed out that the Federal
Government may not find it prudent to
make a direct target of the building
industry because of election promises
which, naturally, could not be honored
if even tighter lending restrictions are
applied to institutions. The recently
elected Liberal Government in NSW
had as one feature of its election plat-
form a promise to release more Crown
land for building. With its tenuous hold
in the Lower House, a departure from
this promise could prove detrimental to
the Liberal Party in NSW if an early
election were forced.
A leading city and metropolitan real
estate auctioneer said if economic con-
ditions worsened he did not expect a
fall in prices. “During the 1960 credit
squeeze, when it was almost impossible
to sell properties, they kept their value.
There may have been one or two that
were bargains because of a forced sale,
but, generally speaking, owners were
not willing to part with their properties
at a loss or even at a break-even price.
They held on till the position cleared
and were able to sell for a reasonable
sum. The same thing will happen this
time if we’re hard hit.”
Selling property by auction is a grow-
ing industry in Australia. The benefits
of real estate auctions are similar to
those outlined in last week’s Bulletin
story on general auctioneers. There is
competition at the sale and often a
higher price is realised than if the
property were to be sold by private
treaty. The person selling property at
auction has an added advantage over
the private treaty seller. The private
seller has to reveal a price, even though
it may be an unrealistic and inflated
one, if he is to attract buyers. The seller
at auction, however, does not have to
reveal a reserve price. This further in-
creases the spirit of competition.
One auctioneer expects both private
treaty and auction sales to diminish in
number after the Budget in August.
“But I think the greater fall-off will be
in private treaty sales. One of the
reasons for this is that certain types of
property are best sold or must be sold
at auction. Properties offered for sale
by a mortgagee, for instance, must be
sold by auction.
“Deceased estates are generally ‘put
under the hammer’ because executors
and trustees are equipped by law to dis-
pose of the estate in the best interests of

the beneficiaries. Auctions are also
quicker than private sale.
“I would like to see more auctions,
because they eliminate a lot of time-
wasting caused by showing prospective
clients around a home, office, or build-
ing.
“You get your stickybeaks, of course,
but when auction time comes you know
you have a large number of genuinely,
interested buyers, some of whom eventu-
ally go well above the price limit they
have set.”
Economically, the position is far more
serious with livestock auctions than real
estate. There are two forms of live-
stock auction —the saleyard, where the
animals are sold for slaughter, and the
store auction, where they are sold for
fattening or to stock properties.
The dearth of prime animals has
brought ahout a marked increase in
prices. Fat lambs, for instance, at
Flemington (Sydney) saleyards are cur-
rently fetching up to £7 a head in good
condition. This is pounds above the
price paid in normal economic and
climatic times.
For store sheep and cattle, on the
other hand, prices have fallen up to 30
p.c. in some cases. One livestock
auctioneer said there were virtually no
store auctions being conducted in the
north and west of New South Wales.
“Most stock which has to be sold on
the store market is being sold in the
paddock or on the southern NSW and
Victorian markets,” he said.
“But here the owners are facing a
problem as great as the drought. To
get the best prices animals must be
moved to these areas and there is a
critical shortage of rail wagons at
present. At the moment you can only
secure large numbers of cattle and sheep
wagons for allotment some time in
August. It is a gamble for the farmer
whether he will try to hold on to his
stock till then or move it by road.
“Here the question of economics
comes in. Will the price he can get in
the southern markets offset the extra cost
of transport? It costs roughly £3 a
head to move grown cattle by rail to
Victoria. By road the price goes up to
around the £7 a head mark.”
A break in the drought is not
the solution, said another livestock
auctioneer. “The problem as I see it
is not so much a shortage of water as
a shortage of feed. A break in the
drought now would not mean feed until
about September. The animals are in
such weak condition at the moment that
heavy rains would bring bog conditions
and cold, and I don’t think the animals
are strong enough to live through that.
The losses would be far greater in the
w'et than the dry.”

The Accountants’ New Clothes
More thoughts on the Vatter and Martin reports
By A. A. FORSTER
IY/Iy interests in the accounting profes-
sion over the past three decades
have been fairly evenly divided as between
its industrial applications, its public prac-
tice, and its teaching at university level.
This experience has not established in me
any confidence in the viability of revolu-
tions in accounting thought related to
genuine advancements in knowledge,
much less in those so-called revolutions
involving organisational changes within
the profession itself affecting the present
status and the future of its members.
The latest set of proposed changes are,
in part, directed towards finding the best
training programme for the new ac-
countant in the decades ahead. What
form is it desirable for this change to
take?
Do the Martin and Vatter reports pro-
vide the answer or do they merely point
up some of the more important issues?
What is the nature and the extent of the
public interest in this matter? Do these
proposals, as to the Vatter Report spon-
sored largely by the Australian Society
of Accountants, carry with them a threat
to the proper degree of freedom and
autonomy of the universities in relation
to the education and training of account-
ants? Is there any substance in the in-
formed view that they represent an
attempt to secure a more commanding
position in relation to the direction of
policy and control of the profession,
whilst at the same time transferring the
burdens and costs of these policies on to
the public purse?
Do these reports, in fact, promise a
new deal for the profession and a fair
deal for prospective entrants to the pro-
fession; or are they likely to be misused,
to form the basis for creating a merito-
cracy, a basis for restrictions on entry
related more to expediency than to any
genuine pedagogical or professional pur-
pose?
TTavlng regard to the very large num-
bers of people required by commerce
and industry, people with various grades
or qualities of accounting skills; having
regard also to the very wide spectrum of
professional skills in this area, does it
make any sense at all to suggest that the
training of all accountants should be in
the hands of the universities? There may
well be a case in favor of this type of
training for all who wish to engage in
public practice. It is a much weaker
case when attempts are made to extend
it to all accountants.
If the training of all accountants is
eventually to be in the hands of the uni-
versities, this change will bring about
other changes: a re-defining of what one
means by the term accountant; the intro-
duction of public examinations outside
of the universities; the re-introduction of
diploma courses; the creation of other
bodies, other professional bodies, to rep-
resent these people, and so on. Those
whose thinking is moving in a pattern
reminiscent of the mediaeval guilds
might think on the fact that one can
only choose the initial course of action
. . . not its consequences.
Mr Brian Quinn (The Bulletin,
June 12) writes about the Martin and
Vatter reports blithely unaware of the
vigorous and polemical debates now pro-
ceeding within the universities, and out-
side them. He writes as if either these
problems were non-existent, or were
settled issues. He writes in the same un-
thinking and adulatory fashion with
w'hich the courtiers greeted the magic
suit of clothes in that delightful fairy
tale of Hans Christian Andersen. “The
King’s New Clothes”. One of the most
intriguing and breathtaking comments
made by Mr Quinn is the remark that
“some accountancy subjects meet the
criteria of university subjects”. Mr
Quinn is a little late, the caravan has
passed by. In Melbourne last month I
attended a conference of the Austra-
lasian Association of University
Teachers of Accounting, a body with
some 110 academic members drawn from
fourteen universities ten in Australia
and four in New Zealand. Accountancy
has taken its place with Law and Medi-
cine, Engineering and Architecture as a
university discipline in its own right. The
process of separating the “professional”
and “academic” elements in any .of these
areas is a fatuous and pointless exercise,
though one occasionally indulged in by
persons of otherwise considerable emi-
nence.
TI/I’r Quinn also writes about the Vatter
report recommendations as if they
had the force of an Act awaiting only the
Royal assent and for a date to be pro-
claimed for them to take effect. He
speaks of when, not if, all those who
qualify to study accountancy will be
diverted to tertiary institutions —without
the slightest thought as to the views and
policies, and the available and prospec-
tive resources, of the ten Australian uni-
versities and any others that may be
established within the limits of available
funds. Not one of these universities has
recognised the Vatter report as especi-
ally relevant to its future in the sense of
adopting it, or of planning its imple-

mentation. Professor Vatter himself, I
am sure, would deplore an uncritical
swallowing-whole of his initial path-
breaking report. The report was designed
to stimulate discussion, not to command
slavish acquiescence.
Mr Quinn seriously understates the
magnitudes involved in his diverting
plan. I say “his plan” because I am quite
certain that to read the Martin and
Vatter reports together, as if they re-
flected a co-ordinated plan to transfer
the training of all accountants to the
universities, is a classic instance of the
great “either-or” fallacy, a quite illegiti-
mate process of argument. Some mea-
sure of his failure to appreciate the
magnitudes involved may be seen in his
reference to “1000” other students
after referring to 6000 taking commerce-
economics degree courses throughout
Australia. As to the figure of 1000, was
it meant to be 10,000? Actually, there
are approximately 20,000 taking accoun-
tancy courses at technical colleges
throughout Australia. Only about half
of these will progress to and beyond
second year courses, but there is an
additional 10,000 taking the Institute
and Society examinations. Industry
needs them all, the whole 30,000; 20,000
or so trained to what one might call an
intermediate stage, but extraordinarily
useful people nonetheless. And of the
other 10,000, only a small fraction
would qualify for entrance to univer-
sities. If one speaks in terms of graduates
it becomes a very small fraction indeed.
Is it only these who are to be the new
accountants of the future, the new elite?
All shall be equal, but in the future, it
seems, some shall be a little more equal
than others.
Then, if one turns to the figure of
6000 students taking commerce-econo-
mics degree courses throughout Austra-
lia, errors of fact and of interpretation
are again apparent. The correct figure is
nearer 7500. Of the proportion “major-
ing in accountancy”, say one third or
2500, only about 1200, certainly less
than half, have career interests in ac-
countancy as such. The number and
proportion is falling, not rising If we
return, for a moment, to the “total
transfer to universities” proposition, it
beomes quite obvious that someone has
forgotten to consider the logistics of this
transfer in terms of academic staff, lec-
ture halls, libraries, and other facilities.
As a multi-million pound building pro-
gramme and a £5 million overhead pro-
ject, it represents a Treasurer’s (and a
taxpayer’s) nightmare, a flight of fancy
to an academic dream-land and the
frightening prospect of a student empire
upon which the sun never sets.
lyfß Quinn believes that the amalgama-
tion of various bodies within the pro-
fession has been a good thing. This, on
balance, is true. Then, however, he goes
much further than this in favoring what
one can only describe as the elimination
of all the remaining competitors in the
field other than the Australian Society of
Accountants. This proposition might be
put more gently: that he would favor a
merger or amalgamation of the two
principal bodies of accountants, leaving
only the Chartered Institute of Secre-
taries as a separate body. He seems to
believe that there is some principle of
organisation which equates a unitary
body with complete efficiency and
rationalisation. That is a fallacy. A
closer acquaintance with the behavior
characteristics and problems of exces-
sively large groupings would suggest a
quite opposite conclusion, viz., that it
would be most inefficient and, in fact,
would more likely to tend to provide its
own internal disintegration. Some of the
world’s major universities are discover-
ing this awkward sociological fact and
there is a significant school of thought
within the accounting profession itself
which believes that vigorous develop-
ment, and other interests, are in fact safe-
guarded by the continuance of indepen-
dent and specialist groups.
It is perhaps fortunate for govern-
ments and the taxpayers that none of
these issues are in fact settled questions,
fortunate for the future of the profession
that the various universities are autono-
mous, and that there are still three other
major and autonomous bodies represent-
ing the profession.

Reading Between the Lines
Kauri building its profit future
T ooking beyond the rather uninspiring
interim report from the Kauri group
of timber companies it is not hard to see
that, despite the lower profit in the half-
year to February 28, directors have been
laying a solid base on which future
profit increases can be built. Moreover,
the factors which brought about the
lower result will actually help to boost
it in the months and years to come.
Not the least of these was the cessation
of general wholesale hardware mer-
chandising in Victoria. This operation
had reached a permanent stage of high
costs and steady selling prices. Com-
petition prevented the latter from rising
in line with costs. Directors decided to
wind up this particular activity. The
substantial costs involved in doing this
were charged against the half-year’s
accounts.
Another major undertaking during the
period was the complete relaying-out of
the Victorian processing, storage and
handling facilities. This brought about
additional operating costs, all of which
were charged against normal trading
profits. However, this operation will
prove a much more valuable sector of
the business in future. The changes
embraced a modernisation of buildings
and equipment.
Despite all the consolidation and
development which went on during the
half, the group still continued to grow.
As reported, sales over the period were
up by 6 p.c. These were achieved in
spite of the disruptions which trading
must have suffered from time to time.
The Sydney subsidiary was only just
re-established in new premises but made
steady progress in the wholesale timber
and building supplies trades. Work was
going on at Devonport, in Tasmania, to
install pre-dryers and other modern
equipment, including kilns, by April.
Of course the best part about the
interim report was the directors’ expecta-
tion of a steady profit over the full year,
thanks mainly to the winning of an
exceptional contract. This is expected
to boost results in the last quarter. It
also means that last year’s 10 p.c. divi-
dend will undoubtedly be maintained—•
it was the first full one since the group’s
reconstruction and was at the rate pre-
dicted by directors when the plans to
revamp the company were first put for-
ward. It would be worse than un-
fortunate if the rate was cut at this
stage as reconstruction is almost com-
plete. Last year’s profit of £213,000
equalled 13.1 p.c. on capital.
Retail Worries
store retailers in the
southern part of the City of Sydney
seem to be experiencing even greater
trading difficulties. Added to Anthony
Horderns, Marcus Clark, Buckinghams,
and Beb'arfalds is Mark Foy’s, which
operates a prestige store away from the
more successful locations north of Park
Street.
However, despite the continued dif-
ficult trading conditions in the city store,
Mark Foy’s suburban stores and rental
income apparently boosted earnings to
increase profit from £52,718 to £75,507
in the year ended February 28. Directors

say there was a further overall decline
in sales at the city location but “overall
sales, because of the new branches
established last year, were at a record
level.
“Because of the added expenses in-
volved and the difficulty in matching
Piazza (the city store) expenses with fall-
ing turnover, only a small overall con-
tribution of net profit could be attributed
to trading,” directors say.
The improved results can be sub-
stantially attributed to increased rental
income, they say, and add that the com-
pany is unlikely to suffer unusually bad
debt losses, a heartening statement in
the light of the bad debt difficulties other
retailers in Sydney are experiencing. Mark
Foy’s has increased its doubtful debt
provision by £20,767 to £38,717.
The directors say: “In the light of
difficulties encountered by other traders,
although in different fields, (we) have
deemed it prudent to take this opportunity
to add this extra amount to the provision
for doubtful debts, even though it is
believed that it will be considerably more
than adequate.”
Mark Foy’s ss. shares are just holding
their heads above water, being priced
at the moment at ss. 2d. They have
gone as high as 6s. 7d. this year and
as low as 4s. Bd. At their present price

ably better off than those in Anthony

Smooth Breakthrough
Decent reports from Ardlefhan Tin
indicate that the group is at last
breaking through to the stage of satis-
factory production and profits. Surplus
in the 38 weeks to April 10 was some
£93,000, indicating a sharp increase in
recoveries. The result was as low as
£29,000 for the first 24 weeks of the
year. On an annual basis, the latest
profit represents around 15 p.c. on
capital.
The result reflects the rising rate of
tin concentrate recovery —B5 tons in
February, 98 in March and 101 in April.
And since April 10 operations have
been even more successful. Recoveries
in the four weeks to May 8 totalled 105
tons. These were from the treatment
of an average 4904 tons of ore a week.
In the prospectus, directors predicted a
rate of 5000 tons a week once operations
were running smoothly.
Mining has now progressed below the
weathered section of outcrop. This
means that extra plant will be required
to upgrade the concentrates. In
addition, plant modification and more
mine services will be needed to boost the
recovery rate. All these items will re-
quire finance. Hopefully, shareholders
will not be adversely affected by the
finance-raising method which directors
finally decide upon. As it is they have
been waiting quite some time for a
return on their shares.

second best result on the company’s
record and is especially gratifying in the
light of the fact that the previous profit
was earned during last year’s sugar
boom.
Directors had forecast a lower profit
for the group in the interim report last
December, following a large fall in the
estimated Australian sugar crop. The
market expected even worse and for a
while had the shares marked down to
575. 9d. In the interim report the general
manager, Sir James Vernon, said yield
from the cane was lower and costs were
higher.
On the latest result the group paid
£4,254,706 tax, £527,095 less than the
previous year, and increased its pro-
vision for replacement (which includes
depreciation) by £355,303 to £4,751,502.
Earning rate moves back from 30.6 p.c.
to 24.6 p.c. due to the lower profit and
capital increased during the year by the
takeover of Ready Mixed Concrete and
a one-for-seven premium issue.
The group’s full printed accounts are
expected early in July.
Poor Ponsford
breakthrough which Ponsford,
A Newman and Benson appeared to
score in 1963-64 has proved to be little
more than an hallucination. It has been
reported that no dividend will be paid
for the latest December six months
despite steady profits. Turnover was
considerably higher over the period but
higher expenses kept the net result back.
Additional expenses are expected in the
current half as the group is moving to
new premises.
In 1963-64 profit rose for the first time
in four years, from £2OOO to £lO,OOO.
It had previously declined from about
£25,000 over a three-year period.
It is to be hoped that the current
setback for this Melbourne-based manu-
facturers’ representative is only tempor-
ary. Indications are that it is. Sales are
rising and the move to new premises
should bring benefits after an initial
period of disruption.

encourage their confidence in the com-
pany’s success for the foreseeable future.
They say they do not expect the note
conversion to cause any “material”
variation in dividend rate or bonus divi-
dends. Directors have already indicated
a lift in dividend to 12i p.c. for the
current year.
The foreshadowed profit increase is
encouraging news from Comeng, whose
profit slumped badly in 1961 (from
£201,533 to £108,985). Recovery since
then has been steady and strong.
Clear View
HP h e Stegbar group, well-established
Victorian manufacturer of wooden
and aluminium window frames, is at
last to float publicly. Apart from Vic-
toria, the 10s. shares will be listed in
NSW, Queensland and SA where the
group also operates. They will go out
at a premium of 4s. each, which seems
fair enough in the light of past history
and future prospects.
Earning rate on post-issue capital of
£BOO,OOO has grown from 6.9 p.c. in
1961-62, 11.9 p.c. in 1962-63 and 15.7
p.c. last year to a predicted 18.7 p.c. rate
for 1964-65. The shares, which rank
for dividends as from the beginning of
the 1965-66 year, are expected to
collect 10 p.c. annually.
Apart from its own manufactured
items, the group also makes and dis-
tributes the Panaview brand range for
a Los Angeles-based principal. Similar
licence agreements with US groups have
been (and will continue to be) negotiated
for other products. Briner Ads is a sub-
sidiary whose main forte is outdoor bill-
board-type advertising.
The group is well-integrated and well-
organised in addition to being well-estab-
lished. One of the more stable suppliers
to the building industry, it was origin-
ally formed in 1946 to make wooden
clock-cases and filing cases. The busi-
ness has obviously changed drastically
since then.
Insurance Sale

in the assurance subsidiary six years ago
was £1 million, but a large part of this
has been on loan to the parent company.
Until the sale of Customlife the
parent had received only one £60,000
dividend. As Custom Credit’s directors
point out, the sale will release further
funds for “more beneficial use by the
corporation in the development of its
expanding business”.
The Skandia Insurance group is the
largest in Scandinavia and probably one
of the largest in lEurope. It has assets
of more than £4BO million and an annual
premium income exceeding £lOO million.
Prior to its purchase of Customlife it
had operated in the general insurance
field only in Australia. It started opera-
tions here in 1954 although until early
1961 its business was managed by United
Insurance Co. Ltd. It has handled its
own business for the last four years.
Announcing the sale Custom Credit
directors say business of the parent
continues to show a satisfactory increase
over the previous years. A balanced
state of liquidity has been maintained,
they add.
Conservativef
At last year’s annual meeting, share-
holders of Melbourne-based Mobile
Industrial Equipment were told that a
conservative dividend policy was in the
best long-range interests of the company.
These comments followed a year in
which the dividend had been lifted from
6f p.c. to 8 p.c. on capital increased
by a one-for-four par issue.
For the latest half-year to December
31, the interim dividend was lifted from
4 p.c. to 4i p.c., indicating yet another
increase in the full annual rate this
time to 9 p.c. The move did not ruffle
many feathers until the recent announce-
ment of another par issue this time
a one-for-five. As the new shares will
not rank for dividends until 1965-66,
there should be little trouble in main-
taining a 9 p.c. dividend on the in-
creased capital.
From all these goings on, one can
only conclude that the group is doing
extremely well. How else could dividend
lifts and share issues still allow a con-
servative dividend policy?
Last year’s profit of £105,000 equalled
18.5 p.c. on capital, which was excellent
cover for the dividend. Trading was
described as “favorable” in the recent
December six months. Directors must
be able to see a busy 1965-66 ahead of
them to raise working capital through an
issue which follows virtually on the heels
of the last one.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Prestige of English-based Insurance
Is the Commercial Unions premium justified?
Jt is fairly safe to say that insurance
shares have fallen from favor in
1965 and, at 14s. 6d., the Commercial
Union’s shares are no exception. The
high price of 225. lOd. was reached in
1963. Today’s price represents a dis-
count of 363 p.c. on that figure.
Even so, in terms of dividend yield,
the Commercial Union Assurance Co.
of Australia Ltd still seems to be well
priced in relation to other insurance
shares: —
Dividend Yield,%
Commercial Union 2.8
A.P.A. _______ 3.9
M.L.C. _______ 4.5
Mercantile Mutual _ . 3.2
Queensland 3.4
South British _ 4.0
The exception is the Securitv and
General w'here, on the basis of the last
sale of 355. 9d., the dividend yield is
1.7 p.c., but, at the time of writing, there
was no buyer and the seller was asking
365. There is no doubt that the English
have developed considerable expertise
in the insurance field over the years
(although their reputation is based
mainly on their high standard of in-
tegrity). It may well be that this expertise
more than justifies the present premium
on the Commercial Union of Australia’s
shares against the average price being
paid for the shares of the Australian
“natives”.
There can be no doubt also that the
prospects for future growth are rather
better in Australia than they are in the
UK. Even so, the investment managers
of the London-based investment trusts
must be looking at the dividend yields
available from the shares of the English
insurance companies and wondering
whether a 5.7 p.c. dividend yield from
the parent company (Commercial Union
UK) will not more than compensate for
the future growth that must be antici-
pated when the subsidiary’s dividend
yield is only 2.8 p.e. They will probably
also wonder w ; hy the pattern is rather
different in the UK so far as the in-
dustry dividend yields. For, according
to the prices at June 2, these yields
were as follows:
Dividend Yield %
Commercial Union _ 5.7
General Accident _ 4.6
Guardian 4.0
Legal & General 2.7
Prudential 43
Royal _______ 5.2
It is readily apparent that the Com-
mercial Union Australia has had a good
record of dividend increases since listing.
The rate has been increased by one half
of one p.c. each year and the share-
holders were given the opportunity in
June, 1962, to subscribe for further
shares on a one-for-two basis at 'a price
ot 12s. 6d. After adjusting for the
“bonus content” of that issue, the index
of dividends per share would appear as
follows (the indices for the Mercantile
Mutual, Queensland and South British
are also given for comparison purposes):
Year 1961 1962 1963 1964
Commercial Union 100 108 138 147
Mercantile Mutual 100 100 100 105
Queensland 100 100 120 i 20
South British 100 117 117 121
If one felt that the rate of growth of
the dividend per share would continue
into the future at the same rate as in
the past, then one could only agree that
the present pricing of all these shares
is quite reasonable according to their
differing prospects. One questions, how-
ever, whether a rate of growth as high
as 131 p.c. compound per annum can
be maintained for very long, particularly
when the industry average over a period
of ten years would seem to be just about
half of this rate,
YlTith the other insurance companies
” previously examined, I have made an
attempt to assess the probable future
growth in investment income by examin-
ing the factors which have contributed
to this growth in the past. The position
is a little complicated in the case of the
Commercial Union because, first, we
do not know how much tax was paid on
the investment income in any year and,
secondly, it would seem that an arbitrary
amount is transferred from the con-
solidated investment income to the life
assurance revenue account. Judging by
the figures in the consolidated accounts,
the return on the average investments of
the group before the interest charge and
income tax was about 6f p.c. This
suggests that the return on the life
assurance portfolio would only be about
£46,500 in 1963-64 instead of the
£103,409 shown. However, the life fund
will build up rapidly. While the actual
return to the Commercial Union share-
holders will not be large for many years
to come, it is unlikely that it will be a
drain on the investment income for very
long.
Similarly, it is difficult to judge when
the fixed loan to the UK parent company
will be completely repaid and the interest
charge of £60,000 eliminated. Another
difficulty is to allocate the appropriate
proportion of the tax provision to the
investment income so that a comparison
can be made with the Australian com-
panies reviewed in earlier articles. In
the hope that the estimate will not be
• too far wide of the mark, I propose to
assume that all the income “from other
investments” is taxable at the full stan-
dard rate and the income “from shares
and debentures dealt in on prescribed
Commonwealth Stock Exchanges” is free
of tax. (This assumption produces a
reasonable result when applied to the
1960-61 year, for which two sets of
figures are available.) The comparison
would then be as follows:
„ % increase
Year 1961 1962 1963 1963 1961-1964
Commercial Union 10.2 10.9 13.0 13.3 30.3
Mercantile Mutual 13.9 16.4 18.9 18.2 31.0
Queensland 17.5 19 3 20.0 21.7 24 1
South British 16.5 17.5 18.7 19.4 17.5
This comparison certainly does not
suggest any reason for pricing the Com-
mercial Union’s shares on a higher level
than those of the other companies. If
the Commercial Union’s dividend yield
was to be the same as that of the Mer-
cantile Mutual, the former’s shares would
be priced at 12s. 6d. (or 13s. 3d. if an-
other 2 p.c. is to be added to the rate
this year). If the price was to be based
on the “investment income” ratio, then
the shares would be at 14s. 4d. if the
figure shown in the schedule is used but
only 11s. 2d. if the deductions are taken
into account.
I would suggest that at the present
time a price of 13s. would be appropri-
ate, judged by the prices of the other
insurance shares.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Most Reliable Spares
A good steady income stock
11/lelbourne-based Motor Spares Ltd
is best known as the manufacturer
and distributor of “Chieftain” radios and
television sets, “Master Sports” and
“Speedwing” bicycles, “Road Chief”
batteries and reconditioned automotive
engines. Another well-known brand
name was added to this list in the latter
half of last year—“Sidco” tools and auto-
motive spare parts. The new subsidiary
was acquired from Siddons Industries
and is expected to help the cause of
Motor Spares considerably. It was
originally owned by Melbourne’s now
deceased “quiet millionaire”, Mr W. L.
Buckland.
The acquisition gave Motor Spares its
first truly interstate activity. The Sidco
company operates in Hobart and Laun-
ceston as well as Melbourne and
suburban Gardenvale and Dandenong.
The group’s only other interstate estab-
lishments are two NSW branches, one
at Wagga and the other at Albury. In
Victoria, the business is run through
five Melbourne centres, about seven
suburban centres, and close on twenty
branches in outer suburban or country
areas.
The group wholesales and/or retails
its own manufactured items through
these centres and handles outside pro-
ducts such as marine engines and as-
sociated equipment, industrial appliances,
engineers’ tools and household electrical
appliances. It also acts as a distributor
or co-distributor of a long list of general
automotive products. Among these, the
best-known would be many of Auto-
motive Components’ products, Bosch
electrical goods, Champion spark plugs,
Munro Wylie shock absorbers, Sid-
chrome and Turner tools, Victa lawn-
mowers, Villiers engines and Wibroc
accessories. The list includes everything
from jacks' and pistons down to car
heaters and windscreen wipers.
Needless to say, fortunes depend on
the motor industry. Being basically only
a distributor can make life rather hard
at times, too. Nevertheless, the financial
record is a fairly steady one, although
earnings over the past decade have never
allowed shareholders to benefit in any
way other than the dividend distribution.
On this point, though, the company has
never failed. This shows the importance
of non-automotive activities when that
industry is not doing so well. The lowest
dividend since 1950 is the 10 p.c. rate
being paid now. The peak was 15 p.c.
in 1950-51. The last issue to share-
holders was in 1956-57, and a very small
one at that.
_
The company* steady nature is prob-
ably best shown by performance during
the “credit squeeze”. In 1961-62, the
year which seems to have been the worst
in the ’sixties for most firms, Motor
Spares’ earnings touched a low of 11.2
p.c. This result was actually excellent,
considering the times. A steady 10 p.c.
dividend was distributed. Recovery has
been slow since then, with earnings at
12.2 p.c. in 1962-63 and 12.5 p.c. last
year. Dividend was 10 p.c. in both these
years. The Sidco acquisition and a
certain amount of reorganisation during
1963-64 should help bring about an
earnings breakthrough in the current
year. j
Profit for the December half-year,
recently reported, was about £56,000.
After deducting preference requirements
this represents 16.6 p.c. on capital on
an annual basis—the best rate since the
18.4 p.c. of 1956-57. The result came
after higher sales in all divisions. The
final result is more likely to be around
the 16 p.c. earnings level, however, as
the last half of the year usually sees

less business than the first. Nevertheless,
the year will be a good one and share-
holders will see another 10 p.c. dividend.
A new modern store with customer
parking facilities has now replaced the
old leased premises in Malvern. These
were at the stage where expansion could
no longer be efficiently achieved and
better results are now expected from the
branch. A branch of Sidco and the
Geelong Nautical Centre have been
housed together in new premises at
Geelong. Again the company has its
own premises and is no longer under a
lease. ,
The strong competition in the electrical
appliance field has finally forced the
group away from straightout whole-
saling. Turnover has nevertheless risen
since a discount house was opened in
Sydney Road, Coburg. As all sales are
for cash, there are no bad debt problems
either. These had previously been quite
a worry. The automotive spare parts
subsidiary is now housed in the same
building.
The marine section continues to grow
each year as boating becomes a more
popular sport. Last year another store,
on the Nepean Highway at Cheltenham,
was opened to deal exclusively in marine
sales. The cycle division is holding its
position in a competitive trade. The
“Master Sports” bike won the “Sun”
tour last year for the third time in
succession. Honors like this are a great
help in an industry which is threatened
by lower-priced imported models.
It has been some time now since the
group disposed of its automotive re-
conditioning plant. The move appears
to have had little effect on overall per-
formance. The company still runs profit-
ably as a reconditioner of engineering
units and parts.
All these moves, as well as the Sidco
acquisition, have provided a boost to
group profits. The amount of planning
and reorganisation was quite extensive.
Yet directors have managed to keep a
firm hand on expenses while increasing
or expanding the number of outlets,
most of which are strategically located.
It would seem that profits will benefit
just as much in 1965-66 as they have in
the current year from the changes and
extension.
The accompanying table shows the
steady nature of the group’s finances over
recent years. Current assets show very
slight growth, while current liabilities
show hardly any, resulting in a gradually
improving and adequate figure for work-
ing capital. The big increase in business
this year has boosted both these items
considerably and improved working
capital even further.
Fixed assets show steady growth but
will be boosted much higher this year
by new property and the Sidco acquisi-
tion. Intangibles remain low, representing
entirely goodwill. The steady ordinary
and preference capital reflects the lack
of issues since 1956-57. Reserves show
very slow but definite growth. They will
be lifted much higher this year if the
dividend is maintained. Loan capital is
very high, but there appears to be no
repayment problem. An unsecured note
issue of £200,000 falls due on June 30.
Another £192,000 represents deposits at
call. Both these items could be met by
this year’s higher working capital. How-
ever, another note issue seems very likely
as a re-financing project.
Share prices have not varied very
much because of the group’s steady
nature. Lack of capital issues necessarily
puts the stock in the income-earning
section of the market—dividend yields
have not been below 7 p.c. Profits,
dividends and earning rates reflect what
has already been said. It is worth noting
that last year’s profit would have been
as high as the buoyant 1960-61 year had
it not been for the higher tax commit-
ment. The provision was only £3000
below 1960-61, although net profit ended
up £20,000 lower.
To sum up: A good buy for those
seeking steady and reliable income.
Current prices of 6s. 9d. yield a high
and attractive 7.4 p.c. from the dividend.
Profits should be considerably higher this
year and next. They may even bring
about a higher dividend or a share issue.
These are only side considerations, how-
ever. As dividends have survived the
fluctuations of the motor industry in the
past, there is no reason why they should
not continue to do so.

Shareholders in Cemac Associated
Ltd will probably have shown no
surprise in the recent announcement of
the company’s second bonus in less than
five years. Their main reaction probably
was one of irritation that the handout
should have been so long delayed, for
the company has been very rich in assets
and has had a high earning rate.
Cemac floated as a public company in
1957 following an issue of ss. shares
at ss. 2-1 d. plus charges, with a paid-up
capital of £BO,OOO. It began operations
as a private merchandising company in
1951, handling plywoods, veneered
panel and doors, and certain specialised
materials, including Seaply.
Expansion between 1951 and 1957
was fairly rapidly accomplished by a
series of takeovers, which eventually
changed the status of the company from
that of a merchandiser to a manufacturer
of plywoods.
Capital expansion after flotation fol-
lowed quickly, again principally by the
takeovers, though shareholders par-
ticipated in a one-for-four issue at par
in 1958. A large parcel of shares was
placed at a substantial premium in 1960
to finance expansion and a similar
method was used to raise funds early last
year.
Shareholders benefited by these place-
ments and received a one-for-five bonus
in 1960. They have just participated in
a similar handout (May 28). Despite the
growth in capital, dividend has been held
at a well-covered 12i p.c. each year since
flotation. Directors expect to maintain
this rate after the latest bonus.
Profit-earning capacity has been par-
ticularly good. Despite a fall in sales
in 1961-62, profit has shown an increase
in each year except 1959. Last year profit
jumped from £107,286, equal to 27.2
p.c. on capital, to £125,786 (28.3 p.c.),
more than maintaining the earning rate
on the higher average capital employed.
The result was after lifting deprecia-
tion from £42,493 to £44,551, ( and taxa-
tion from £78,004 to £101,735. The
dividend took only £55,600, considerably
less than half the earnings.
Sales last year totalled £4,067,389,
compared with £3,203,796 in the
previous year and £2,831,735 in 1961-
62. Directors point out that a wider
range of products, improved techniques
and expanding manufacturing facilities
enabled the group to benefit from the
more favorable trading conditions.
One secret of the company’s success
is that the takeovers have enabled the
group to control its source of supply.

30 last, clearly show the expansion of
the past 12 months. Land and buildings,
including leaseholds, are up from
£332,415 to £416,850, compared with
£284,526 in 1962. Similarly, plant is up
from £379,818 to £389,882, but directors
have adopted a policy of substantial
depreciation write-offs. After allowing
£140,548 in the latest year, the
depreciated value of plant at last balance
date stood at £249,334 compared with
£261,859 a year earlier.
Despite the recent expansion, the com-
pany is still in a highly, liquid position.
At last balance date stocks stood at
£694,352 compared with £496,617 a
year earlier, and were matched by a lift
in trade debtors from £523,498 to
£752,118.
Much of this expansion was financed
by trade creditors which during the year
rose from £271,708 to £466,901, while
current overdraft with the ANZ Bank
rose only from £16,755 to £26,344. A
small overdraft with the CBC actually
fell during the year. However, the com-
pany has a substantial term loan from
the Bank of Adelaide and, during the
year, called on another £10,329, lifting
the loan to £321,097.
At last balance date, capital reserves
stood at £357,366 compared with a paid-
up capital of £444,803. Surplus profits
totalled an additional £300,410. In-
tangibles, principally goodwill on con-
solidation, stood at £171,105, giving each
5s. share a net assets backing of 10s. 6d.
The latest bonus is made from the
share premium reserve, which at balance
date stood at £344,597, and lifts present
paid-up capital to £533,764.
The current year has so far been
successful, with both turnover and profit-
ability showing a marked increase on
that recorded in the corresponding period
of the previous year.
The latest bonus has far from emptied
the capital reserves cupboard. The
shares could well be bought for future
benefits.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Not Time to Lose Heart
Some speculation on long-range forecasting
11/hat with a quick trip to New
"" Zealand and the confusion of our
own market, it’s only this week that I’ve
managed to calculate the progress of
my portfolio.
Surprisingly, it has risen from £2OOO
to £2445 in the first seven months of
my financial year. And that’s all due
to the tin market and a put option on
United Telecasters. Tableland Tin alone
contributed over £3OO to the total profit
Tableland has eased temporarily, but
should come again once the tin price
moves above £l5OO.
Of course the industrial market is
the one which has been the most up-
setting. Yet this is not the time to lose
heart, especially if you follow the
argument that things are at their worst
now and so can only get better. (The
converse argument also applies, where
things are so good that they can only
get worse. Remember last September,
when we had record overseas reserves
and a buoyant economy.)
Speculation on the drought fits into
the above theme. For six months it went
almost unnoticed by the Press. Then
suddenly, in the last month, touring
newspaper teams vie for the most tragic
news and splatter their findings across
the front pages. What else could I be
but pessimistic until I read that the long-
range forecaster, R. Lennon Walker,
expects rain at the end of this month
followed up with good rains in October.
I remember quite clearly his forecast
made several months ago that NSW
would not receive rain until June. Let’s
hope he’s as right with his current pre-
diction!
It probably seems paradoxical that the
first transaction for the week was the
shorting of R. and N. Statham. In the
market upset last Wednesday the shares
slipped to Bs., recovering to Bs. 9d. the
following day.
The progress the company has made
since it was listed in 1962 is to be
admired. Nevertheless the combination
of a doubling of capital in less than a
year and the inevitable shrinking in
demand from its country customers due
to the drought must eat deeply into
the earning rate in the next financial
year. One official report estimated that
the wheat crop in NSW would only be
half that of last year, even allowing for
rains to fall in the next week or so. I
shorted 400 shares on the price reaction
to Bs. 9d.
From here I went on to take out a
call option on 200 F. W. Williams shares
at 365. 6d. Options can be an expensive
way to invest, though in this case they
would seem to be the ideal form of
investment.
Before the directors made their “don’t
sell” statement at the beginning of the
month, the 10s. shares were selling at
335. 6d. The market’s first reaction was
to mark the shares up to 40s. They
have since slipped half way back. If
the discussions do lead to some direct
benefit to the shareholders then the
option will have proved a wise move.
If, on the other hand, talks result only
in the sale of one of Williams’ minor
interests, the loss is restricted to the cost
of the option.
The last few transactions of the week
involved a reassessment of the market.
Firstly, I decided to increase the Steam-
ships rights to 3000 in all. So far the
price of the rights has sagged, though
if the market shows any life at all these
should be one of the first to respbnd.
The sales of Mauri Bros and Stott &
Underwood were primarily made to im-
prove the cash balance. Both resulted in
small losses.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
400 Stott & Underwood, 5/2 .... £99
200 Mauri Bros, 16/6 £l6l
400 R. & N. Statham, 8/9 £l7l
BOUGHT
1000 Steamships Trading, rts, 1/6 £BO
200 F. W. Williams, options, 2/5 £24
This leaves me with a credit of £lll.
Now that I’m launched into the second
half of the year, let’s hope another “tin”
situation develops.
This left me holding:

AUSTRALIAN
WHISKY
lately?
THE MAN ON THE LAND
The Mythology of US Meat
Fair access versus Hollywood image
Jj\>R the country which invented public
relations the United States manages
to do a pretty dismal job on its own
behalf. Instead of giving various Aus-
tralian envoys the good old Washington
run around on the beef and wool issue
it would be a good idea if the US
Government stated the facts plainly
unpleasant as they may be for us. If
we knew that the difficulties may very
well be impossible to overcome, then
we could save ourselves a lot of money,
and time, trying to break into a market
which may very well be denied to us
for a long, long time.
Of course it is not altogether im-
possible that the Johnson Administration
may be able to ease the tariff on Aus-
tralian wool apd curb the discriminatory
States’ laws against Australian meat.
But investigation of the problem, from
the American side, gives the impression
that the sort of access we would like —
free and unrestricted —may be just ex-
pecting too much.
Wool, indeed, offers better hope than
meat. The local US wool-growing in-
dustry is heavily subsidised, and is run-
down and generally moribund. Cur-
rently the local US wool manufacturing
industry is reorganising itself in a most
exciting and dramatic way. New fac-
tories, incorporating automation and
computerisation, are going up. They
are taking more Australian wool now,
despite the 25 p.c. tariff, and with luck
will take more still.
However, one must consider that this
wool would probably go somewhere else
if the US did not take it. Price is wool’s
problem, not lack of markets. There is
no glut of wool on the world scene.
There is, instead, the price problem
created by the substitute cotton (the
major one) and the synthetics. So with
or without the tariff, increased buying
of wool by the United States can be
regarded as desirable and a big help to
Australia. Beyond that, the likely
benefits to us can be over-emphasised.
But meat, beef and mutton have no
substitutes. They have a price problem,
too, yet they are not in the prices strait-
jacket the way wool is. The advent of
the American market for boneless beef
and mutton seven years ago was a shot
in the arm for Australia. It would not
be saying too much to suggest that it
gave us, for the first time, a real export
industry in the case of beef.
Before the war Australian beef had
a lowly reputation. It went into beef-
extract mixtures. Hides and bonemeal
were almost worth as much as the meat.
As most people know, the trade boomed
dramatically and was then curtailed by
a voluntary agreement with the US
limiting shipments. Now the trade is
getting down to half what it was three
years ago and may be further restricted
by the individual States’ laws relating
to hygiene, labelling and packaging.
The powerful US cattlemen’s lobby
wants Australian meat kept out and is
getting its way. The States’ laws do
not bear close scrutiny.
This country has gone out of its way
to make Australian killing works comply
with US hygiene regulations a good
thing, too, as home consumers get the
benefit of improved killing methods.
Swift’s, the giant American-owned meat
company, has even had a killing works
built for its use by the taxpayers of
Victoria (largely), which is really extend-
ing the hand of friendship. Swift’s can-
not be that short of money.
Every Australian politician, business-
man, and just plain tourist who visits
Washington has a ready-made topic of
conversation on the beef question. The
Australian Meat Board has made its
views well known . . . and has very
wisely begun to develop markets outside
the US at the same time. Everyone
appears to get the same answer: Be
patient and we will see what we can do.
What the men in Washington do not
tell us is that for a number of rather
obscure, and peculiarly American,
reasons, they are not in such a good
position to do anything at all. The
American cattle industry is a very special
one. It is the covered wagons heading
west, the Indian wars on the Great Plains,
Custer’s last stand, and the lone cow-
boy on the wide prairie. It is also Gene
Autry and his guitar. Americans are as
confused about the realities and the
myths as much as anybody.
One of the great strengths of the
United States is that a tremendous range
of authentic material is available, even
if it is not thrust at you in the same
way as the Hollywood version of history.
Many of the present-day American
ranchers doubtless believe that it was
they, or their kin, who created the cattle
industry. The facts show otherwise.
It was British and Dutch capital
mainly that went into ranching when
the Indians were tamed and the buffalo
shot out. It was British stock, too.
Herefords and Durhams (ancestors of
the Shorthorns), and British breeders.
Just as we need an export outlet now,
so the American cattle industry needed
an export outlet last century. It was
found in Europe. In the 1890 s the main

cattlemen’s club in Kansas City was the
English Club and you had to wear white
tie and tails to dinner. Remarkable, is
it not?
Remarkable, also, that Hollywood has
convinced us that the genuine cowboy
of the time rode in a Mexican-type saddle
and wore clothes something like a
present-day rodeo rider. Yet in the
museum in Texas you can see saddles
and bits and other accoutrements of the
frontier days. If you know about these
things, you get a mild shock to discover
that they are last-century English design
and make.
World War I ended the English in-
fluence. The ranches had to be sold to
pay for munitions. Those that were left
went in World War II before Roosevelt
created lend-lease. The memoirs of the
generals and the stories of the battles are
all highly interesting, though it is a
shame that nobody has written so
enthusiastically about the economic side
of warfare.
What has all this to do with the
present situation regarding the entry of
Australian beef to the United States? A
lot, really. In spite of the cold facts,
the cowboy has become a special part
of American folklore. You would find
it hard to convince any American today
that most of the lore was created by
publicists for the railways, by garment
makers in dingy New York alleys and
by the celluloid dream-makers of the
motion picture industry. The Americans
watching their TV sets know better than
that and so do the present-day ranchers
whose great-grandfathers, if they rode
the range at all, did so as hired-hands.
That is perhaps why the US ranchers
have rejected price supports and sub-
sidies on beef offered to them many
times by various US Governments. Their
pride will simply not permit them to
accept. Until they do, there is little
that any Government can do to break
down their attitude towards meat im-
ports which, as the poverty statistics
indicate, are needed badly.
It would be difficult, as well, for any
US Government to force any section of
any American industry to accept a
bounty on home produce if that section
did not want it. Americans, remember,
have very special beliefs about private
enterprise and are quite self-conscious
about the farm subsidies and supports
programme. Without them, their system
would come apart at the seams, yet
they profess not to like them.
We should not be too critical. Some
of our own Australian woolgrowers
allow their pride to blind them some-
times to economic realities. Economic-
ally the Australian wool industry would

not have even got started had it not been
for British capital. But then that can
be readily overlooked also.
If Australian beef is to get fair access
to the American market, there seems,
economically, only one way. The US
ranchers, who say they cannot compete
against cut-price Australian imports,
must accept a subsidy along with wheat
growers, the dairy farmers, and others,
who take some 6000 million dollars a
year in price supports and direct sub-
sidies.
A subsidy seems the only way of over-
coming the peculiarly American impasse
of beef producers who say they cannot
compete with imports and at least 20
million citizens who say they cannot
afford to buy home-produced beef. Is
pride a virtue or a vice?
Registration of Firearms
Farmers put the case again
m H E spate of shootings in Victoria and
South Australia in recent months
has caused farmer organisations to raise
yet again the question of registration of
owners of firearms. Calibre .22 rifles
can be bought freely in Australia by
anyone, trigger-happy youths and men-
tally-deranged people included. The six
recent deaths, plus additional woundings,
were caused by .225.
Most of the stock killed and wounded
by carloads of louts, and this is happen-
ing every weekend, are victims of .22
bullets. When the regulations were
framed years ago the .22 was a boy’s
gun something to plunk at rabbits
with. Today the .22 is a lethal weapon.
The velocity has been increased remark-
ably and the bullets can be bought with
various jackets which increase the killing
potential.
Some of them are as dangerous as the
.303 rifle of World War 11. Some of them
will fire just as fast as the trigger can
be pulled. Some can be converted, with
a few simple tools, into virtually a sub-
machine-gun.
Gun experts say that two factors
have influenced .22 design enormously
since the war:
• The trend towards lighter weapons
by armed forces.
• The scarcity of game in the US
resulting in sporting rifles which shoot
further and faster.
Relatively speaking, .22 rifles are
cheap. They cost a little more than a
tennis racquet but not nearly as much
as a set of golf clubs, skin-diving equip-
ment, or a surf board. They can be
bought for as little as five pounds down
and ten bob a week. There’s no need
for a would-be killer —or just plain
crank—to get a heavy-calibre rifle any
more. A .22 will do the job just as
well.
Approaches to the authorities in the
past to have .22s registered have failed,
and always for the same reason. The
office work and manpower needed would
make such registration very expensive.
But six months ago farmer organisa-
tions put up a plan to have owners of
firearms registered. This would be a far
simpler process and in every way it
seems a commonsense move.
A person would simply have to apply
for a permit to own firearms (how many
does not matter) and would have to
furnish a character reference, proof of
age, and an address. This would not be
perfect by any means, yet it would at
least prevent obviously peculiar types
from purchasing guns. So far nothing
has happened.
