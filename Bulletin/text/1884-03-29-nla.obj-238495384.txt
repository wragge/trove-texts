SATURDAY, MARCH 29, 1884.
Conservative Flounderings.
The Quarterly Review has been investi-
gating the question of British pauperism,
and, as might be expected from an autho-
rity so steeped in the spirit of Gradgrind,
its conclusions are calculated to afford emi-
nent satisfaction to the “proputty ” owner.
These conclusions are, in brief, that the poor
are not getting poorer, and that what there
is of pauperism is tbe result of intemperance
in the way of drink and tobacco ! We are
told that in 1843 the gross income of Great
Britain was 515 millions sterling, the average
income of each family of the wage-earning
population being about £40 a year; and that
in lb8i the gross income of Great Britain
was over 1200 millions sterling, the average
income of each family of the wage-earning
population being between £95 and £100 a-
year. The inference drawn by the Quar-
terly from these figures is that the poor
are getting richer. On tho supposition that
the figures are in any way this is a
comforting inference for the wage-earning
-'copulation. But how about the sheer pau
perism, which contributes one-thirtieth of
the total population of the United Kingdom ?
How can it be supposed that the 1,360,000
registered paupers of the United Kingdom
are in any way benefited by the statistical
fact that “ the incomes of those who have
less than £150 a-year have increased during
the last forty years by 130 per cent.” ? That
between the years 1843 and 1883 house rent
has fallen and clothing and food decreased
in price (and possibly in quality), are cer-
tainly circumstances that may be said to
affect advantageously those who have got
money to spend; but, for the life of us, we
cannot see how they can affect the abnor-
mally large and rapidly-increasing pauper
population. This pauper population be-
tween 1876 and 1883 went up from 1,028,000
to 1,360,000; and this increase ought not to
be regarded as a mere statistical question of
ratio as between increase of population and
increase of poverty, seeing that in propor-
tion as the gross total of national wealth
annually multiplies, so also should multiply
the power, the ability, and the will to assist
tho respectable poor from irretrievably
sinking into the slough of abject pauperism.
* * *
The argument of the Quarterly certainly
possesses the merit of ingenuity, whatever it
may lack in the way of ingenuousness. By
adopting the same method of reasoning,
it might be shown that if a community of
100 persons had started in 1843 with incomes
ranging from £50 to £500 a-piece, and by
1883 two members of that community had
absorbed the incomes of all the others and
the profits arising therefrom, so that they
twain each possessed some £50,000 a-year to
the nil of the remaining 98, the community,
as a community, had grown the more pro-
sperous by the difference between the gross
total incomes of the two dates! That by the
way, however. Tne Quarterly Reviewer
having proved to his own complete satisfac-
tion that the poor are not getting poorer—
and we fully admit that the dregs of pauper-
ism can’t by any possibility get any lower—
airily suggests that what there is of poverty
is not the result of anything being rotten in
the political or social fabric, but is the direct
outcome of Drink. Land monopoly has no-
thing at all to do with it—and that fellow
-George is a seditious hound for asserting
that it has. Drink is the sole cause. The
low wretches will drink beer and whisky—
and pauperism is the bitter fruit of their
intemperance. Would they butqueneh their
thirst in pure water, the income average of
the wage-earning population would strike a
yet higher note, and all would be well! Thus
the Tory property-holder ! And is it not
delightful to see him who for the sake of the
poor man attunes his tongue to the praises
of water, compelled by the force of fortune
to fare sumptuously every day ?
• • •
Quite naturally the social-political views
of the Quarterly dovetail into the con-
victions of the Sydney Morning Herald.
With a Conservative eagerness, that some-
times outruns even that of the organ of
British Jingoism, our local daily contem-
porary accepts as matters of course—that
great masses of the people must be poor!
that poverty and pauperism are the re-
sult of intemperance; and that the
political fabric is in no need of re-
form in the socialistic direction. “No-
body,” says the Herald, “who has the
slightest acquaintance with our social life
can pretend for a moment that the destitu-
tion which undoubtedly does prevail at
times has in any way been brought about
by the Government sale of land. Those
who administer our charities have a large
amount of experience on that point, and it
is perfectly safe to say that they have never
traced the slightest connection between
poverty and land proprietorship.” It is,
indeed, “quite safe to say that,” since
“those who administer our charities” belong
almost to a man to the class that constitutes
the staunchest buttress of the social status
quo. Echoing the Quarterly, the Herald
traces pauperism to Drink. Having some
little truth in it, this theory is accepted by
the unthinking as entirely true, and as
covering the whole ground. It is certainly
a most convenient theory for the wealthy.
Yet, as Henry George remarked tho other
day, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, “It is not drink
that is the greatest cause of poverty. No!
It is poverty that is the greatest cause of
Drink " That’s about it. For one man
whom Drink has impoverished there are five
whom grinding poverty has first demoral-
ised.
Pauperism is developing in New South
Wales. About 1 in every 200 of the popula-
tion is an absolute pauper; and, besides,
there is a very considerable floating destitute
population, very many of whom are neither
loafers nor drunkards. Moreover, in all the
larger centres of population the “slum’'
area is annually increasing. In the metro-
polis and elsewhere mayoral activity may
make occasional raids upon the nuisance
but, whilst the municipal law remains un-
altered, the only effect of such activity is to
drive the evil it professes to cure further
into the system. And, as a matter of course,
contemporaneously with the increase of the
slum area and the growth of pauperism, the
inequalities of privilege and wealth are fast
augmenting. Here, as in England and in
America, “everything tends (as Gbough
says in his “Social Problems”) to the rapid
and monstrous increase of these inequali-
ties.” Our belief is that the main cause of
this serious state of things is bad law—
specially bad agrarian and bad municipal
law; and we thoroughly agree with George
that the landlord system must be radically
reformed. In this matter, Australians
should not be above learning from the
American experience which goes to show
that, in aland where democratic institutions
are in full operation, yet where those insti-
tutions have not been so worked as to secure
a reform of the land laws borrowed from
England, land monopoly flourishes as stoutly
and with the same sort of fatal results as in
the old country. Where land is monopolised
by the few, the many cannot employ them-
selves. They must seek for employment*
The people of this colony cannot expect
that the simple fact of the possession of
democratic institutions will save them any
more than it has saved the people of the
people of the United States from the disas-
trous effects of land laws that systemati-
cally create and designedly encourage land
monopoly.

Use, as determined by its direct relation to
the public interests, should be the sole
measure of the occupation of the land by
individuals. The greater share of all un-
earned increment arising from the soil must
be gotten into the national exchequer. As
an initial step towards securing these ends
a tax should be imposed upon the value of
land. The effect of such a tax would be to
increase both the incentives to labour and
the rewards of capital; and, by stimulating
improvements in every direction, to afford
a larger amount of remunerative ocoupa-
pation to the mechanical and labouring
classes. At the same time, steps should be
taken to divest ownership in land of every-
thing resembling feudal privilege; to widen
the municipal franchise, so as to admit of a
lodger vote; and to reform the immigration
service, which, as it is at present worked,
does at least as much harm as good by keep-
ing up a constant supply of a very inferior
stamp of colonist. Reforms such as these
would bo as the blows of an axe at the root
of the prime causes of poverty and pauper-
ism. At the same time bona fide Temper-
ance reform need not be neglected. It is
well that the drink curse should be battled
with; but it is raising a wholly false issue to
pretend that that curse is the sole cause of
the annual impoverishment of thousands of
the people, and of the absolute pauperism of
millions, when it may be so much more
truly said to be the effect of Poverty. Only
to go for Temperance reform, and to neglect
the other far more radical reforms, would
be simply to play into the hands of the land
monopolists, which is just what would please
the Quarterly Reviewer and those con-
servatives in N. S. Wales whose opinions are
manufactured at the corner of Pitt and
Hunter streets.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Gospel Truth.
The Adelaide Prbarson’s Journal remarks
fatuously that “ in America, where Henry
George was born, he is looked upon as a drivel-
ling lunatic; in England he is looked upon as a
dangerous schemer. For ourselves, we presume
him a little of both.” And then, having spat this
assortment of stupidity, falsehood, and venom at
a profound thinker, whose views it is not compe-
tent to criticise, it proceeds t© abuse certain South
Australian reverends who have gone in for the
Californian economist. One of these reverends,
the Wesleyan Carter to wit, delivered a
sermon, the other day, on the text (Leviti-
cus xxiii. 26), ‘‘The land shall not be sold for
ever, for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and
sojourners with me,” his object being to show that

the intention of the original Jewish agrarian law
was virtually to prevent land monopoly by keep-
ing the land in the possession of the whole
people in perpetuity, and thus to form a race
of patriots by giving each man and each
family a direct stake in the soil. This healthy
and correct view having “ riz ” Frearson’s
dander some, that organ of economic orthodoxy
thereupon brayed as follows: “We say that if the
Wesleyan Conference is honest, they will seri-
ously take the reverend gentleman to task for his
outrageous conduct in this dangerous, false, and
heretical sermon.” And not content with general.
Ised abuse, the foolish Frearson must also
go in for what it idiotically deems to be the
particular proofs of Carter’s falseness of doc-
trine, giving allstof instances from the Bible of the
buying of land by Jeremiah, Judas Iscariot,
and Ahab, in complete and total ignorance that
these instances tell for Carter against itself, since
they are instances clearly proving that in the days
of Ahab, Jeremiah, and Judas self-interest and
greed had corrupted the law in question (as invari-
ably they corrupt all laws) and originated a custom
antagonistic to its intrinsic morality.
It’s a way they have in the army, we suppose—
that is, the N. S. Wales army—but it’s a way
neither we nor justice can understand. Here are
a few of the sentences passed on offenders in our
Permanent Artillery:-“Conduct prejudicial to
good order,” 32 days; “disobedience of orders, and
allowing civilians to create a disturbance,” reduc-
tion to the ranks; “ dressing in plain clothes in
the streets,” 43 days; “improperly dressed,”
non-commissioned officer reduced to ranks ; “ as-
sociating familiarly with a gunner,” non-com-
missioned officer reduced to ranks ; “smoking in
the streets,” 14 days. It will be seen what heinous
offences the above are in a free country, especially
the two latter. Let us now take a peep at the other
side—apparently the very blind side—of our
military N.8. W. justice. A man who stole and sold
the property of his comrade got 14 days, just what
the “smoker in the streets” enjoyed. An officer
who collared a cheque, and made a false entry in
the register, received—twelve months at least ?
Oh, no I 14 days—just a third of the sen.
tonce which the “ plainly dressed in the
streets” party got. On the other band, a de-
serter and an insulter (who’d blame them ?) of his
superior (?) officer received each a few weeks short
of a year’s hard labour, and were then drummed
out in disgrace 1 Oh, and we note another smoker
in the streets got twenty-eight days—just double
what was doled out to the officer cheque-stealer.
But, isn’t there something sublimely suggestive in
the crime of “familiarlyassociating with a gunner I”

The Deniliquin Chronicle says that kan-
garoos are dying in mobs from thirst up about
Warrah Station. If the poor kangaroo only knew
what excellent soup his tail would make, ho might
soak the end of it in a little hot water every day,
and thus obtain a very palatable as well as a very
nourishing drink. But the kangaroo, like Mr-
Service of Victoria, doesn’t know everything.
The Cootamunbra ’Erald is on the buck
once more, and this time it has its coffin-shaped
head between Its knees in its wild endeavours to
hoist the local racing club •* hummlty.” Fault the
first is that the C.J.C. doesn’t advertise its sports
enough, and as a natural sequence, sheets of tin
and brown paper still take the place of glass in the
’ Erald windows, and the gentleman who worries
up the “ future-pollcy-of-England-in-the-Soudan ”
pars, has to rub ink on his sock to assimilate its
colour to that of the surrounding portions of the
E.S. boot through which it ostentatiously pro-
trudes. Fault the second is—but let the complain-
ant speak himself : “People are not satisfied in
this msthetic age with rude rusticity. The inti-
mation of the auctioneer, when selling the club’s
rights, that members were permitted to take two
ladles to the grandstaad, and that ladies were ad-
mitted free to the stand, seems after the event
like a piece of grim humour, seeing that ladies fox-
sitting accommodation are provided not with
chairs or forms, but with the floor only; and our
modern ladies would not care to squat down in
black-gin fashion on tneir haunches.” We don’t
exactly know w hat style of females, “ ladies for
sitting accommodation ” are, but we venture to
think that for chasteness, and appropriateness of
simile that of com.paring modern ladies to “ black-
gins squatting dow n on their haunches” lays over
anything of the kl ad. we can remember since the
day when the Mayor of Coventry, complimenting
Queen Elizabeth on her victory over the Spanish
Armada, said: “When the foreigner sailed he
thought he had yc >u fast, but your Majesty soon
let him see that 1 xe’d caught the wrong sow by
the ear this time.” We predict a brilliant future
tor the ’Erald if t he Qgjce is not blown down by
the next breeze.
A Symphony in Brown and Purple.
The Queen’s new book, “More Leaves from My
Journal in the Highlands,” was published just
before the last mail left England. By a provoking
mistake our presentation copy has not come to
hand. We don’t know what has come over the
Queen lately. Half-a-crown’s worth of stamns
should not have been permitted to stand in the
way between friends. Perhaps, however, the
weather w«s wet before the mail left, and Bertie
had lent the civil-list umbrella. Anyway, our
copy is not to hand, and we are under the neces-
sity of reading the work piecemeal in the home
papers. The dedication is, wo observe, as fol-
lows “ To my Loyal Highlanders, and es-
pecially to the memory of my devoted Personal
Attendant and Faithful Friend, John Brown,
these reeords of My Widowed Lite in Scot-
land are gratefully dedicated, Victoria, K.I.”
The work appears to be replete with gems of
thought and incidents of thrilling interest. There
is, for example, the nerve-shattering incident of
I the carriage accident. The Queen was driving
I with Lenchen and Alice, and attended by Brown,
when the vehicle was upset. With the presence of
mind and devotion which endeared him to his
Sovereign, Brown had promptly jumped oft and
saved himself as soon as he saw what was going to
happen. In spite of this magnificent self-sacrifice
on the part of the devoted Brown, the Queen fell
ker-flop, and hit the ground with her face “ very
hard.” The ground hurt her, a specimen of heart-
less disloyalty so degrading that we are surprised
not to read further on that, on being remonstrated
with, the earth opened and swallowed itself.
It is in moments of peril and suffering that genius
flashes forth. The talent and devotion of Brown
are accordingly recorded. The promptness with
which ho rushed into blasphemy and imbecility
marks him as no common man. The Uoyal jour-
nalist records, with keen admiration, these traits.
“The Lord Almighty have mercy on us!” roared
Brown, with instinctive feeling that the proper
thing to do was to grovel at some throne —even
if it were the Throne of Grace —“ who did ever see
the like of this before!'’ Of cour e we do not
exactly know what was displayed o Mr. Brown’s
eyes at the moment, although Alice and
Lenchen do appear to have been a good deal
sommersaulted and tousled; but if the spectacle
were merely a coach upset and some ladies spilt,
it does seem as though Brown might have learned
that suck sights had occasionally happened pre-
viously, without appealing to his Maker for an
“ answer to correspondents ” which even Alf., of
the Town and Country, could have supplied.
But, if Brown was nrompt and discriminative, his
Royal employer flashed witn even a brighter
radiance; and, when penning the history of the
immortal adventure, recorded the profound con-
viction which grew up in her mind. The horses
were prostrate, and Her Majesty observes that
“it was absolutely necessary to get them up”
before they could bo re-employed for pur-
poses of traction. The truth, the unimpeach-
able |truth, «f this fine philosophic Induction
places it at once on the highest pinnacle of in-
tellectual discovery. But, if Brown displayed
devotion when the Royal authoress was concerned,
the feeling was at Last reciprocal. Deep as may
have been Brown’s suffering when Her Majesty
bumped her head, It was at least equalled by the
solicitude of his tender-hearted Sovereign on the
subject of his own legs. Thus we read with de-
light—for it is ever precious to discover the work-
ings of Nature and humane feeling—that “I was
much distressed at breakfast to find that poor
Brown’s legs had been dreadfully cut by the edge
of his wet kilt, on Monday, just at the bach of the
knee, and he said nothing about it; but to-day one
became so inflamed and swelled so much that he
could hardly move.” This condition of the back
of Brown’s legs makes very interesting reading. We
are onfy surprised that, as these splendid
memoirs mention that Her Majesty was made ac-
quainted with a Scotch haggis about this
time, it did not occur to her to combine her infor-
mation, as Oliver Goldsmith concocted his article
on “ Chinese Metaphysics ” out of the articles on
“China” and on “Metaphysics” respectively in
the Encycdopcedia. Given Brown’s excoriated
legsaad a haggis—result, haggis used to poultice
the back of Brown’s legs. The case was really
worthy of heroic treatment, for we read further
—and the exactitude and minuteness of the detail
do credit to the powers ot observation possessed
by the talented authoress:—“ It was really most
distressing to mo to see what pain poor Brown
suffered, especially in going up and down hill. He
could not go fast, and walked lame, but would
not give In.” When one bears in mind that
Brown’s wounds were excoriations caused by
the chafing of the edge of his petticoats,
the confession is forced from one that no
nobler instance of endurance is recorded in
history, sacred or profane, since the justly-cele-
brated Mr. Patrick Maguire walked from Calais to
Rome with his shoes full of peas-boiled peas.
There are other incidents of equal interest. There
is the story—Illustrative, as appears, of the fatal
nature of the Princess Louise—of a good old lady,
a Miss M'Gibbon, who was too ill to come out, and
was visited by Her Majesty. In the Queen’s very
presence this rash old woman “ patted Louise on
the shoulder.” The result is told in the next
sentence: “She died soon after.” This, [perhaps,
sheds some light upon the reason why Lome
doesn’t but this would lead us into too
long a digression. Whether the Rev. D.
Macleod and Sir Thomas Biddulph had also been
betrayed into tapping the fatal Louise on the
shoulder, we have no moans of learning. But it is
recorded that they both died, and Brown was “in
it” each time. But we must quote :—" We had
come home at five minutes past eight. I had
w ished Brown good night, and was j ust going to my
dressing-room when he asked to come in again
and say a few words to me. He came in and said
very kindly that he had seen Colonel Ponsonby,
and that there was rather bad news from Dr.
Macleod, who was very ill; in fact, that they were
afraid he was dead I Oh, what a blow I My tears
flowed fast, but I checked them as much as I
could, and thanked good Brown for the kind
way in which he had broken the news.”
One charm of truly intellectual writing is that one
reads so much between the lines. In this fashion
we get a glimpse of the true nature of Dr.
Macleod, and the qualities which made him so suc-
cessful as a clerical courtier. Thus the canny
doctor “ gave us such a splendid sermon on the
war f and, without mentioning France, he said
enough to make everyone understand what was
meant (when he pointed out that God would punish
wickedness, and vanity, and sensuality; and the
chapters he read from Isaiah xxviii, and from
Ezekiel, Amos, and one of the Psalms, were really
quite wonderful for the way in which they seemed
to describe France). It was all admirable and
heart-stirring.” One sees exactly the reverend
gentleman’s talent, in this, and understands at
once that, if Her Majesty had happened to be
Queen of France, the doctor would have managed
to make it quite clear that the texts and his
hints had distinct application to “ Pcrflde Albion.”
There is one little incident of a strange lack of
sensibility, consideration, and good feeling which
the divine authoress records. It is on the part of
Sir Thomas Biddulph—one of Her Majesty’s
equerries. As already mentioned, old Biddy went
and died. Well—but here you have it: “Brown
came round with a n«te in his hand crying, and
said ‘ It’s all over.’ It was from Sir William, say-
ing that dear Sir Thomas passed away at twenty
minutes past twelve. We were so distressed that
we had not remained at the house. Brown was so
vexed, and so kind and feeling. Dreadful! Such a
loss! Dear Sir Thomas was such an excellent,
honest, upright, wonderfully unselfish, and disin-
terested man—so devoted to me and mine. Under
a somewhat undemonstrative exterior, he was the
kindest and most tender-hearted of men.” We can
imagine nothing more inconsiderate than Sir
Thomas’ conduct in this matter. He should have
known Brown would be “vexed” if he died, and
yet he went and died in the most thoughtless way.
The authoress leaves no room to doubt that
Brown’s heart was as tender as-we are at
a loss for a simile—ah! as tender as the back of his
legs. When the news of the death of the Prince
Imperial of France came, we have it recorded that
It was “too awful,” “Brown so distressed.” That’s
another of them distressing Brown, who, as far as
we have materials to judge, had done nothing to
deserve their spitefulnees, The following la the
passage:—“Oh! it is too, too awful 1 The more
one thinks of it the worse it is! I was in'the
greatest distress. Brown so distressed; everyone
quite stunned. ... To think of that dear
young man—the apple of his mother’s eye—born
and nurtured in the purple—dying thus is loo
fearful—too awful—and Inexplicable and dreadful
that the others should not have turned round and
fought for him. It is too horrible!” Thus we
have the monarch’s heart laid bare. All the Queen,
you see. It is inexplicable that a young man, nur-
tured in the purple, should be killed like a common
soldier, who, of course, is never the apple
of Ms mother’s eye. Such incidents expose a
certain degree of carelessness and inattention on
the part of Providence, quite “ inexplicable.” The
Royal authoress obligingly prints the original tele-
gram sent by Sir Garnet wolseley after the battle
of Tel-el-Keber, which ran thus:—“ Arabi’s
strongly-entrenched position was most brilliantly
and gallantly stormed by the Guards and Line.
. . . Enemy completely routed, and his loss has
been very heavy ; also regret to say that we have
suffered severely. Duke of Connaught is well, and
behaved admirably, leading his brigade to the
attack.” In commenting on this telegram. Truth
gays :—“ Seeing that the Guards did not ‘storm
the entrenched position’—that we did not ‘ suffer
severely,’ and that the Duke of Connaught did
not lead his brigade to the attack—one wonders
where Sir Garnet could have acquired his informa-
tion. He certainly could not have witnessed the
battle.” We find a deal more about the Queen’s
friends, her servants, and something about her
dogs, which are praised as “ well-bred,” — that,
perhaps, is one reason why they were not made
C.M.G.’s. But we don’t find anything about one
subject, her people, who are probably not interest-
ing because they are not like collie dogs—well-
bred. A Court pup is certainly more interesting
to write about, and to keep sleek and well-fed, than
a back-slum baby. There is nothing about back-
slum babies in this most interesting work, which,
we are told, concludes with another tribute to
John Brown, whose soul is now marching on,
untroubled by frayed legs.

and Inspector of Nuisances, and Goat Ranger.” It
was signed: “Yours condescendingly, Beatrice
de Montmorengi . . . . ,” and “references
kindly permitted to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales*
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the President of
the French Republic, and the Pope of Rome.” We
have not learnt yet whether or not the lady has
got the situation; but we should think, if she did
get it, things In the Council would become a good
deal more complicated than they are already.
Whenever a woman pushes into anything in the
business way, there is always a flare up. We know
this by experience. Just look, for instance, at
those newspapers In which they engage female
comps, and clerks. Why, there’s more type pie’d
and formes smashed in one of those ollices in a
month, than In 50 male-run journals in a year. We
sub-edited a paper once that had one lady comp,
on it, the daughter of the proprietor, and she kept
us going all the time. One of her failings was to
write copy herself, and set it up, without going
through the form of having it edited. It was
chiefly poetry of a melancholy nature, and we had
to employ a hoy on purpose to keep on “dls-ing”
it. But sometimes she was too clever for us. She
didn’t care where her “ stuff ” went in, as long as
it appeared, so not unfrequently a dirge commen-
cing,
“ Bruised and broken is my heart,
Sorely wounded is my soul,”
would appear under the heading of “Cow
Auction.” No; we advise the Council to let the
young lady adorn some other sphere. Though not
60 agreeable at first sight, they would find it come
convenient to procure, in preference, even another
old woman to join them.
A “suburban clergyman” has been writ-
ing to the Melbourne D.T., throwing doubt (fancy
that) on the genuineness of some of Mr. Booth’s
“conversions” to total abstinence. What he
seems to particularly complain of is that young
ladies, “more enthusiastic than discreet,” have
been swelling the committee’s list of “pledges”
with scores of very unreliable names. For in-
stance, “many young men who had not the re-
motest idea of becoming apostles of teetotalism
have admitted that young ladies have attached
the blue ribbon to their coats, and taken their
names for registration as pledged abstainers.”
Now, there can be little doubt tnat a nice, fresh,
enthusiastic, young thing, with a blue, beseeching
eye, and a rosebud for a mouth, would he per-
mitted to attach a blue ribbon to the coat of any
young man she chose to attack, and that nine out
of every ten of her “converts” would rush madly
to the nearest hotel and drain a bumper to her
beauty. Still, names taken for registration under
such circumstances would represent human be-
ings, at any rate, and not phantoms from shadow
land; for it is from the other world, apparently,
that these enthusiastic female labourers in the
temperance cause obtain most of their recruits.
The suburban clergyman tells us that “certain
young ladies have actually visited the cemeteries
and taken a host of names from gravestones, and
handed them into the committee as bona jMe
cases.” The practice of persuading “stitf-’uns”
to become abstainers has raised, in the breast of
many an old toper, the ardent expectation that he
will find strong drink in the next world, and that
the spirits he will meet with will prove to be
material as well as ethereal. Certainly, it is only
on that assumption that we can account for these
graveyard conversions. By the bye, how do the
girls contrive to attach the blue ribbon to these
“ cases ? ”
Here’s a “reliek” of the giddy past. In
order to infuse some little degree of civilization
into Russian society, and give a tone to the First
Family “hops” of the time, the Empress
Catherine II. issued a ukase, part of which joggled
along in thiswise:—“We, Catherine, Empress of all
the Russias, hereby ordain that: All ladies giving
parties to their friends and acquaintances shall
send out invitations by letter or verbal message.
Such parties are to commence at 4 or 5 o’clock, and
not to be extended beyond 10 in the evening. The
master of the house shall provide chairs in each
room, also candles, liqueurs, and other refresh-
ments for the company; moreover, cards, dice,
and other games for their entertainment.” So far,
Catherine’s mandate reads chaste enough to suit
even the present moral age, but a little farther on
the old girl (who must have been behind the
scenes herself occasionally), says: “Ladies are ex-
pressly forbidden to get drunk under any pretext
whatsoever; nor are gentlemen permitted to do so
before 9 o’clock in the evening. When the ladies
play at forfeits, or similar games, they are care-
fully to avoid everything that savours of im-
modesty. No one shall he permitted to enfore a
kiss from them, and anyone attempting violence
is to be at once expelled from the company. «iven
in our Imperial Palace,” &c., &c. Fancy Queen
Victoria Issuing similar orders to-day ! What a
flutter there would be in the Uppah Buckles.
The cry is still—“Retrench.” And a
mighty good cry it is, too, when properly followed
up. But we fail to see the wisdom in docking a
shilling off a half-starved and putting a
pound rise on the screw of men who draw their
thousands. In the good old days, when trams were
first started, it was found necessary to employ
some of the check clerks for four hours every
Sunday, and, as these men only received £2 a week,
the Minister very properly allowed them a few
shillings overtime for their Sunday work. No
sooner had the present Minister assumed the reins
of office, however, than he was struck with a bril-
liant idea by which retrenchment could bo en-
forced, and his bleeding country saved. And,
accordingly, he issued a minute ordering the
above-mentioned overtime to be stopped, because,
as he asserted, the clerks were handsomely remu-
nerated for a week’s work, and Sunday was in-
cluded in that week. Legally this is wrong,
because, in law. Sunday is no day at all. Besides,
if the tram officials are to be deprived of their
Sabbath overtime, Ave'll trouble Mr. Wright to ask
Mr. Trickett why a telegraph clerk, who draws his
£350 per annum, is allowed £1 for carefully doing
nothing for ten hours on Sunday ?
Swift’s wit is as pungent as Mackay rum.
The great Dean showed that cucumber is derived
from Jeremiah, thus: Jeremiah, Jerry, Jerrykin
jerkin, gherkin, cucumber. Some of our Austra-
lian words are on the same high road. Mount Ida
(goldfield) has become M‘Ivor; a spot on Bandicoot
Creek became Bendigo; while Gabo (island) is only
an aboriginal blackfellow’s peculiar way of
pronouncing the name of the neighbouring Cape
Howe, accepted in all innocence by a primeval
surveyor. We once named a lake in the interior
Tah-e-ra, under instructions from an intelligent
aboriginal who stood by, scratching himself by fits
and begging by starts. When we showed our plan
to the squatter, and pronounced the name as
grandly as a turkey-cock gobbling, he merely ex-
plained that It was his Dairy lake, in the paddock
where the family milch-cows abode. Thus, in lots
of Instances, do we “com® to our English ” ao-aln
like a Scotch fishwife in the tantrums. One double-
pubbed place has been successively Booral, Brooal
Brewer, Boorowa, and Is now Burrowa; but it will
probably soon become Burrower, and eventually
either Kabbitville or Grabitall, Then there are
apparent natural affinities to distract us. For
instance, what relationship does Lake Cow-cowing
(W.A.) bear to the Victorian town Buln-buln ?
Discussion invited.
At a recent Botany banquet, one of the
brilliant orators made the rather novel and
startling announcement that “ Britons never
would be slaves ” Now, we fail to see any sensible
reason why Britons should be so loud in their
denunciations of slavery, and we are still at a
greater loss to know why they should take such
credit to themselves for partly checking the
business, considering that England was amongst
the first nations in modern times to start it. The flrtt
Englishman who engaged in the slave trade was
Sir John Hawkins. In 1563 he transported a large
cargo of negroes to Hispaniola, or Havtl. and in-
vested the proceeds of their sale in cargoes of
sugar, ginger, and pearls. His profits in this
adventure were so great that Queen Elizabeth
became a partner in his second expedition, which
sailed five years later. In August, 1619, a Dutch
man-of-war entered James River, and landed
twenty negroes for sale at Jamestown, Virginia.
The captain’s name is not known, but he made
several other successful ventures in the “blaek-
birding ” line; and in this way, by the connivance
of England and Holland, African slavery was first
introduced into an English colony. Then, again,
why should Britons “round” upon their “bul-
wark?” One of the most frequently mentioned
subjects in—what the Rev. Robjohns calls “ The
Word is slavery. It was first started by old
man Noah when he cursed Chanaan, and swore ho
should be “a servant, of servants (i. e. a slave) unto
his brethren.” Father Abraham was a bit of a
“nigger” owner, too: and there are few more
cowardly acts on record than the way he kicked
the Egyptian girl, Hagar, and his own son out into
the bush with nothing but a damper nnd a flask of
water to support them on a nine days’ journey.
And yet a lot of brainless blatherskites think they
are sending England up with an 80-ton gun boom
when they yell out “Britons never shall be
slaves.”

I cheerfully add my testimony to the good
eflects derive,able from the use of ST. JACOBS
OIL as demonstrated in my own household. Some
few weeks ago my wife suffered severely from
pains in her head. She applied the Oil with excel-
lent results, and has since recommended it to a
friend for a case of swelling- in the legs, in which
case the result was equally beneficial. It has been
used by members of my family, and its action has
satisfied my most sanguine expectations. I con-
sider it a most valuable preparation to have by
you for any household accident. I recommend it
confidently to my friends, and am thoroughly
satisfied “ It Conquers Pain.”
I remain, yours truly,

the last of the detachment which, under Colonel
Hepburn, aided in the defence of the farm and

He saw thirteen of his brother officers shot down
in the defence of Hougomont, but escaped with-
out a scratch. He retired from the Guards in 1835.
After a careful search “ Ouida,” the
naughty but nice, has been discovered to
be a daughter of George Lawrence, the

remembered, had a penchant for crushing pewter
pots in his hand and twisting pokers round hotel
waiters’ throats wnenever he thought they were
short of neckties. He was an interesting cuss for
a time, however, and combined the Apollo-like
beauty of R. B. Smith with the Chestorfleldian

are built on the same pattern.
According to an Irish paper, the missing
war correspondent, Edmund O’Donovan, was at
one time a Fenian, and did six months in Limerick
gaol. It is alleged that he was one of the most
active of that body’s agents. Subsequently he
went to France, joined the army, and at the de-
fence of Orleans was taken prisoner. He next
appears as correspondent for the Freeman’s
Journal, in the Carlist war, and afterwards hold-
ing a similar position for the Daily News in the
late Russo-Turkish struggle. His life was one of
thrilling adventure, and his fate a mystery.
It is shrewdly suspected that the beer con-

considerable falling off at the end of the present
year. The reason of this is simply because old
Brown is dead. Didn't know Brown1 Why, we
thought even the fish in the river knew Brown.
Brown was a blacksmith’s clerk, but about six
months ago he received £500 from home, and him-
self and his spouse at once went on a howling tear.
What the fun was like, may be guessed from the
fact that the publican’s records show the thirsty
pair have placed themselves on the outside of five
gallons of beer every other day since they touched
the legacy. And, a few days ago, a neighbour
happening to call in, found Brown lying dead on
the floor, while his wife sat up in the bed yelling,
and gibbering, a hopeless maniac from the effects
of beer. Beer. Bier.
Mr. Walt Whitman writes of his poems :—
“ They proceed out and revolve around one’s self.
Myself, an identity, and declaredly make that self
the nucleus of the whole utterance.” Right you
are, Walt. We have just been bewrayed into
reading you. We flatter ourselves that we are
above following the yelping of some of your
American critics, who don’t even give you credit
for the beautiful things you have said. But, tak-
ing Rosettl’s edition of your picked pieces, it
strikes us you make yourself not only the nucleus
but the tail of a very feccentrlc comet. What else,
for instance, makes you speak of the Austral man
as “red” and “sooty” in the same line? When
you gush out your huge sympathy with every-
thing human, what makes you include even the
filth of humanity ? And, then, your cataloguing of
trades and occupations to show that you know
every phase of American activity! Are there not
guides, trade circulars, directories, and all that, so
that we might know of the smelting, hide-curing,
and the dustman’s cart, without having them
dished up as poetry ? Let those things “ revolve
round yourself ” by all means, but do not let them
revolve around us. Walt, they say, lies down and
looks the sun in the eye at noonday. Some verses
appear to show he is equally intrepid when the
fair orb of night looks him in the eye.
Governor Broome of Western Australia
has had as many ups and downs as a war corre-
spondent. As a stripling he went to New Zealand,
and during the intervals snatched from tending
flocks, ho read everything, from Monte Christo to
the latest opinions on the nebular hypothesis.
He has long since given over study, owing (we give
the rumour for what it’s worth' to having been
sent a complimentary copy of an Australian
work-the “ Murmur of the Streams ” by Sir
Henry Parkes, K.C.M.Q., late Premier of N.S.
Wales. After reading the book carefully Mr.
Broome set fire to his library and started for a
holiday in England. There he met Lady Barker,
the young widow of an old General. They were
married and went to New Zealand. Then came
hard times for the sheep-farmers, so young
Broome and his wife returned to England. She is
said to be a “ medium ” of exceptional power
The whirligig of chance threw her in the way of
a famous Duchess who, like Rachel, was mourning
the loss of her first-born, a boy of eight. Mrs.
Broome at once opened up communication
between the Duchess on this side of the river and
her son on the other. Then the great lady took
Mr. Broome in hand, introduced him to Delane, the
Times’ great editor, and got him a job. Among a
lot of miscellaneous work, he wrote an article
knocking the stuffing completely out of Harriet
Beecher Stowe’s account of Lord Byron and his
half-sister. The interest that got him on the
Times subseouently ran him into the Secretary-
ship of the Mauritius and probably had a hand in
landing him in Western Australia. The moral of
all this is obvious. Whenever you “ go broke ” at
squatting, cut away as fast as you can to England
if you are on the right side of 40, get all the army
lists for some years back, and take the names of
Indian general officers who have lately taken seats
in the celestial orchestra leaving young widovs
behind who know something of mesmerism.
Then look out for a Duchess who has lately lost a
boy, and—if you’re not Viceroy of Ireland in a
year it’s because the Irish dislike Viceroys and
don’t understand mesmerism. Golly I if we had
had a Duchess behind us for the last 10 years!
Let s see. Where were we when the
“boss” editor came prancing in asking for the young
person that sent the “elegy on a dead ornitho-
rhynohus,” and flourishing the last poet’s femur
over his head? Under these constant irruptions
our appetite and our hair are going fast. We were
at “General” M’lver, whose schemes for supply-
ing moral pocket handkerchiefs to the Papuans
were so unkindly up-ended by Lord Derby.
“ Mac.” is a true soldier of fortune, and was once
a non-commissioned officer in the English army.
Not that he is the worse for that. Coleridge,
Cobbett, and Forbes were full privates, and there
are now in the ranks of the army, and always
have been, men who in one hemisphere of their
brains have more real knowledge stowed away
than could be found in the crania of a dozen of the
hobbledehoys sent from Sandhurst to chivvy them.
But ’twas in the old “purchase” days, before the
“Grand Old Man” sent his toe through the
“ Royal Warrant,” that the well-bred joskins
from whom the ordinary marching regiment officer
was manufactured had it all their own way. Well,
this MTvor doesn’tget his rank from the Turks. Au
contraire, they’d skin him if they had a chance, for
his having helped the Greeks to make border
raids upon them a few years ago. He helped
Garibaldi to tickle “ Bomba’s ” tail, was with the
Carlists in Spain, the Federate in America, the
French on the Moselle, and commanded the Ar-
gentine foreign legion in the Paraguayan
trouble. Bei jides this he was in the Servian in-
surrection, ai id went for the “ unspeakable ” with
as much alac rity as Jack Johnson in “ Don Juan.”
The Turk se ems to be his especial bete noir, and
the efforts he made to get employment at Athens,
in order to ha ve a slap at his o d enemy, deserved
success if they' didn’t secure it. “ Mac.” is a gentle-
manly, shrew d, well-informed man. He speaks
Frencn fluent ly. has a powerful physique, is as
great a flre-eai ;er as ever swore in Flanders with
uncle Toby, aa d loves luieeionaries and “ niggers ”
as the Protestant Standard loves the confes-
sional. In the Servian insurrection already men-
tioned, ho was Brigadier-General, in command of
a body of cavalryrconsidered by competent judges
to be the model of an irregular force. They were
so a irregular, that they were never known to
be altogether, except at meal times, and, with the
solitary exception of the Tower Hamlet milita,
were supposed to know more about distraining
goods coming their way than any equal number of
warriors engaged during the war. With one troop
of his ci-devant comrades he is prepared to im-
prove every nigger off New Guinea, and make it a
fine country for the working man.
The name of Sir Wilfred Lawson is as
closely associated with the Temperance move-
ment in England as that of Professor Miller with
the Graeco-Roman style of wrestling in Australia.
But he is a good deal more than a teetotal advo-
cate. He is the member for Carlisle, in the very
front rank of Radicals, and as honest and courte-
ous a gentleman as any within the four seas. But
in debate he is a terrible hitter, and few members
care to throw the first stone his way. A short
time ago one of his tenants made some improve-
ments on his farm. They were partly beneficial
to his landlord, but chiefly to himself. One thing,
at all events, is certain—the tenant’s improve-
ments gave him no claim for compensation—so that
a cheque for £800 from Sir Wilfred was a very
agreeable and unsuspected windfall. English
papers say that the incident is a thoroughly char-
acteristic one.

purity and real eloquence, which: he sarcastically
published in 1843 at a farthing (the price of the
new edition of ’76 is, however, 9s.). For some
years he edited the Monthly Repository. In
1874 Beaconsfleld granted him a civil list pension.
Richard Hengist Horne was a kindly, honourable,
brilliant, eccentric man, with merit as a poet
much greater than his fame. Some seventeen
years ago, or thereabouts, Horne was a well-known
character in Melbourne. He was an amateur on
the guitar, and used to sing his own compositions,
accompanying himself on that classic instiuraent.
On one occasion he appeared in public—it was, we
think, a complimentary benefit to poor Cutolo,
the musician, when that excellent artist was
about to remove from Melbourne to Sydney.
Cutolo, by the way, did not settle in Sydney, and
was on his way back to Melbourne on one of the
A.8.N. Co.’s steamers, when the mizzen boom
broke loose, and, swinging, struck him on the
head, fracturing his skull and killing him. Horne’s
jerformance was not a success. He was an odd-
ooking fellow, to begin with. He wore his hair in
long blonde ringlets hanging on his collar, and his
singing was scarcely audible in a theatre, and
what could be heard was far from melodious. The
gods guyed him unmercifully. A composition by
1m, not mentioned above, was “ The South Sea
Sisters,” an ode for performance before Prince
Alfred, C. E. Horsley set the ode to music, and it was
duly given in the Melbourne Exhibition building,
in presence of the Prince, who delayed the overture
nearly half an hour, by his lack of that “ politeness
of princes,” punctuality — The biography of R. H.
Horne willshow a man with all the possibilities of
Swinburne or Landor to seize the fleeted imagery of
the old Greeks. Everyone has heard of his dwelling
in Australia, and his rather mournlul farewell.
Horne came with no end of nraise and high en-
comium from the most cultivated men in England,
notably Carlyle. The praise of the latter in matters
of pure art are grossly under-rated. Because he had
a mathematic head, and went for solid “ bu Hock-
ing,” as we call it, it is a common fashion to sup-
pose that he had little taste for beauty. His essays
on Schiller, Richter, and Burns disprove it. Ho
found he had no voice for the pretty little voices
that rule the English men of culture to-day, and
he flung himself, with all his massive Miitonisms,
into speculations to which roses, lilies, and love,
can never be more than a pianissimo accompani-
ment to the concerns of greater minds. In “Orion,”
Horne gave the highest learning of the Greeks, in
the most Greek of English. The book is not much
read by us, because beef, and wool, and all the
struggles of a new community, made up of wan-
derers, are here. We can’t help it. Time will
mend all that; and if Horne died unrecognised by
us, he will live again in our more leisurely chil-
dren. And not unto us, but to men like Badham,
you may appeal for that hope. Both “ old men
eloquent.”
J. G. Gregory, Esq., J. P., auctioneer,
commission agent and general financier, Horsham
(Vic.), has pleaded guilty to forging and uttering
bills to the amount of £6090 or £7000, and has now
retired for a period of three years and a half to
Government lodgings in Ararat, whore the stern
demand of the ubiquitous hash-provider for pay-
ment in advance is unknown, and a liveried atten-
dant knows where to find him in the morning. J.
G.—or, perhaps, we’d better call him by his front
name, Jack, lor shortness—was but a youth when
we first set our brilliant orbs upon him, and rather
a dull kind of youth at that. But dull youths
usually develop into pretty smart men. Take, for
example, the first Napoleon. He did not exhibit
any particular talents to start with, if we except,
perhaps, a healthy appetite. Yet his name will be
remembered long after most of our own C.M.G.’s
are forgotten. Then there was George Washing-
ton, whose juvenile genius did not show up worth
a cent, not even when he got into trouble over
that little axe; yet he became a great and
good man. And ourselves. We were not dis-
tinguished by any remarkable traits in our early
life, barring a penchant for investigating the
neighbours’fruit gardens, during the owners’ tem-
Sorary absence. But look at us now I Anyhow,
ack Gregory wasn’t a wonder to start with, as we
remarked already, but, with careful training and
good example, he developed pretty well. Many
a time have we listened to the teachings of his
aged parent, who used, in the early days of Hor-
sham, attend to the salvation of the unregenerate,
whilst the regular parson hunted up the stray
sheep in the outlying districts. Yes, the old man
used to run the local State School, and then amuse
himself during his spare time by preaching the
Gospel. But even the regular parson and his able
co-adjutor could hardly stem the tide of ungodli-
ness which swept over the Wimmera in those
days. Money was plentiful, and the “boys” just
ached for a chance to spend it. And they
didn’t spend it all on churches, either. Champagne
wae very common tipple when such gay.and roi-
licking young sparks as Hector and Norman Wil-
son, and their bosom friends, the Penders, came In
from Vectis for a “tear round.” Then they would
emulate the high jinks of the Marquis of Water-
ford that “ made Dungarvan shake.’ They would
take possession of a “pub.” hand the “stuff ” up
from the cellar to appreciative crowds of reliable
drinkers, ride their fiery steeds through the pas-
sages of the house, thump the police, and, at times,
wind up the carnival by having to appear before
the local P.M. the next morning, who on one
memorable occasion fined them £30 each for their
night’s amusement. It is only fair to state that
the publican’s score—a pretty long one—used also
be liquidated in full by those reckless roysterers.
Yes, those were the halcyon days of Horsham,
when the rival brass bands used to meet in
deadly fray on the public square, and “belt
the stuffing” out of each other with the trom-
bones and horns and bombardons and things,
whilst the populace of that lively town used to
array themselves on eitherside as their sympathies
dictated, and scruff and gouge and punch each
ether until the streets fairly reeked with blood,
hair, and tobacco-juice, not to mention the ornate
style of the outbursts of profanity which rang
clarion-like above the din of battle, and for which
the early residents of that section were proverbial.
The unsophisticated Jack Gregory graduated
amongst these stirring scenes, and got his first
lessons in finance from experienced artists on the
local exchange. Then he launched out boldly Into
commercial speculations, hung out his shingle as
stock and station agent, etc., and having proved
himself a pretty expert “ underground engineer ”
at several elections for the Victorian Legislature,
his services were rewarded by having the Com-
mission of the Peace placed at his disposal. Hence
the J P. But when Jack was pressed for money,
he adopted a spirited plan of raising the wind. In
the words of the immortal poet, “he was handy
wid the pen,” and, by an adroit system of finan-
cing, kept his credit good by forged bills on leading
firms, which he lodged in the bank, and always
took the precaution of retiring them before they
became due, only to replace them with similar
documents. The game worked well for some time,
until a couple of months ago, when Jack was
having a spell in Melbourne, and amongst the dis-
sipations and enjoyments of city life he forgot all
about the bill which just then became due. The
usual exposi followed, and the erstwhile J.P. stood
in the prisoners’ dock. Now he is cracking blus-
metal wherewith to mend the streets of Ararat.
His career was a short, if a merry one. Since he
retired from public life, one of the banks in Hor-
sham lost some cash. We fancy we could spot the
winner in a few tries. But then, you know, we are
clever. While awaiting his trial, Gregory begged
to be placed in a cell with another prisoner, just
for the sake of company, and right here the irony
of fate took a rise out of John G. by packing him
up in a quiet little room with a horse-thief whom
he had committed for trial a few days before.
Gregory pleaded guilty ; and, on leaving for his
new residence at the Melbourne gaol, he was
chained to another prisoner, named Ernest Stack,
and the peculiarity about the business is that both
culprits were school-boys together at Geelong,
that they were both convicted of forgery, and both
were sons of State-school teachers. And this re-
minds us that there’s a heap of truth in the old
saying, “ the greater the crime, the lighter the
punishment.” The well-connected Gregory got a
three-and-a-half years stretch for forging bills to
the extent of nearly £10,000 ; whilst two of the
“ great unwashed,” who opened a hotel window
and stole a pair of pants, valued 10s., a»d a couple
of pounds in cash, received five years for their
trouble, at the same Sessions.

Political Points
Ninny certainly should be knighted, for
what’s a “ whip” without a good “ handle” to it ?
The Grand Old Man, borrowing the ex-
pression from Sir Wilfrid Lawson, says the words
rescue and retire ” describe the Soudan policy of
the Imperial Government. Good.
“ 1 do not remember ever having seen you
open your mouth in the Council,” remarked Jacob
the Honorable to John Nagle of Galong. “ Pardon
me,” said John .Nagle, “ I have done so frequently
—your speeches invariably make me yawn.”
It appears that all the big bugs in Europe
are getting bunged up. Queen Victoria’s knee is
still painful: Bismarck is ill; Gladstone has gone
into the country to recruit; and Lord fieay la in-
disposed—to accept the Governorship of Victoria.
Says the Narandera Argus “ We
absolutely disfranchised by reason of the over-
whelming weight of Wagga influence. It has be-
come absolutely necessary for the average repre-
sentative to watch for the nod of Wagga, or to
forfeit his chances of re-election. The whole
electorate knows that this is precisely the position
in which we stand.
In the Queensland Assembly, Billy Brooks he did
cry:—
“Working me.n ain’t bora idiots—no bloominv
blank fear r’ K
Whereupon Chubb remarked, with an inference
sly
“Billy Brooks ii no working man,” Cries of
“Hear, hear!”
In opening the new wing of Gloucester
Conservative Club, in February, the Duke of
Beaufort said that it was the duty of every man
to put bis shoulder to the wheel, and try to stem
that terrible torrent of democracy and socialism
which was being let loose upon the whole world
“ Of every man ” ! That is good. We can under-
stand his Grace’s personal funk of the torrent
since it is calculated to turn a good many Somersets
out of their places. He should know, though, that
to put one’s shoulder to a wheel is hardly the wav
to stem a flood.
Lord Randolph Churchill recently charged
John Bright with retaining office for two years for
the sake of its emoluments: he also charged the
Liberal Association with corruption. In making
theso charges, he forgot that since the death of
the first Duke of Marlborough the Churchills have
“snavelled ” £680,000 from the public purse; and
that, whereas at the late general election he him-
self polled at Woodstock 513 votes and spent £1060
(or at the rate of £2 4s. 3d. a head), the expenses of
Messrs. Bright, Muntz, and Chamberlain at Bir-
mingham were no more than Is. 5d. ahead.
Poole’s Constitution Act Amendment Bill
provides that any person who shall directly or
indirectly undertake, execute, hold, or enjoy, in
whole or in part, any contract or agreement on
account of the public service shall be incapable of
being elected as a member of the Legislative
Council or Legislative Assembly, and that any
person being a member of such Council or Assem-
bly who shall enter into any such contract or
agreement shall have his seat declared
provision does not extend to any
ment, or tender made by any company (whether
incorporated or not) consisting of more than
twenty persons.
Wolseley says that since he first entered the
army, thirty-two years ago, it had always been
‘ going to the dogs,” yet he maintained that the
physique of the army was as fine now as, if not
finer than, it was when he entered it. At the pre-
sent moment, including the 33,000 men enlisted
last year, 91 per cent, were over 30 years of age, 20
percent, of thirty years; 58 per cent, stood over
5ft. 7in. in height, 83 per cent, were 35in. round the
chest, and 78 per cent, had two years* service.
Taking it as a whole, the army of to-day, in which
he included every branch of the army, militia, and
auxiliary forces, was much more effective than in
the days of the Crimean war—which, entre nous ,
isn’t saying such a lot in its favour.
W. Anderson (or &-derson), in a letter to
the Manning River Time?, animadverts upon the
singularity of New South Wales essaying to meet
financial difficulty by increasing Civil Service
salaries. If, says W.A., the salaries of the
useless drones in the service, were cut down then
additional taxation might be fair, “ but, as it is, I
think economy should be tried before taxing the
poor, starving widow's cup of tea.” Why should
W.A. spoil an otherwise strong case by dragging
in all that rot about the “ poor, starving widow ?"
Nothing is more likely to make people suspect
the bona tides of a political cry than the intro-
duction into it of any gush about “poor widows”
or “horny-handed worruking men.” Public
affairs should be discussed as they affect men and
women.
Thus the Daily Northern Argus, with
considerable truth: —“ Something must be done to
break down the ‘one idea’ men, who hold the
notion that a few head of cattle and a bark humpy
constitute the Australian cockatoo’s paradise.
The chatter of the jackaroo by day, and the howl
of the dingo by night, may gladden the promoters
of the ’ squatting go as you please,’ but we will
have none of it. Six and twenty long years have
passed. Millions of cattle have come and gone.
The earth has brought forth her increase and we
have sent to New Zealand for potatoes and timber;
to Tasmania for jam, to South Australia for flour,
to Sydney for hay, maize and coals, and all the
time have allowed the debt of the colony to in-
crease to the monstrous sum of £70 per head.
Wonderful co>onisation truly I”
Twenty-two years ago a survey party
chalked out the route for a railway line from
Muswellbrook to Mudgee, and the greater part of
the track selected can still be traced. A few
months ago, another crowd of chain and theodolite
bumpers started along on the same errand, and,
after a short spell of masterly inactivity, the gang
has been once more recalled, and the work shelved
in all probability for twenty-two years longer. If
this praiseworthy style of go-aheadness is kept up,
it is thought the first sod of the new line will be
turned on the Day of Judgment, or, if showery
then, the week alter. What the Brook people
should do, is to sell a few thousand acres of the
best land along the route to some pushing M.P. at
about 100 per cent, below its real value. Then the
iron horse will commence to snort instanter.
Our elections here are sometimes pretty
lively, but a recent Harbour Board election at
Wellington (N.Z.) knocks them out entirely. One
candidate, when he rose to speak, found his skull
in very unpleasant proximity to a huge flying
lump of road metal. Of course he at once dared
the thrower to stand forward, put up his props,
and he’d knock spots out of him. At this stage, a
gigantic boiled potato went bang against the
worthy chairman’s head, who thereupon seized a
bottle and vowed by the gods he’d shy it at the
thrower of the next missile. This challenge was
answered by the alighting of another “spud” on
the chairman’s beak, who replied by wafting a
couple of bottles into the crowd. He then sprang
amongst the mob, and a glorious free fight ensued.
No, we can’t touch our New Zealand tree and in-
dependent electors when a real spicy bit of fun i*
on.

The revolutionary movement that has re-
commenced in Spain is the natural result of the
foolish Alfonso calling to his councils ultramon-
tane Conservatives like Canovas del Castillo and
Vidal y Mon. On the very evening that Alfonso
sent for Canovas, Castelar, the Republican leader,
exclaimed in the presence and hearing of a num-
ber of deputies in the lobby of Congress. “ He
/fho King) at last shows himself what he is—the
Lrandson of Ferdinand VII. This stroke of his
convinces me of the fact that democracy is im-
possible with his Monarchy. I will retire from
Parliament, and I will never again enter this
House.” Castelar, the greatest living orator, by
the way, was no doubt right about Alfonso’s
maternal grandfather. No man knows really who
his paternal grandfather was, as his mother Isa-
bella was. and is, a royal harlot. Alfonso’s throne
isn’t worth many days’ purchase.
One day, Colonel Wintersmith, of Ken-
tucky, was in the gallery of the Senate, when
M’Creery, of the same State, arose to make a
speech. Every senator on the floor sought the
cloak-room, except his colleague)and the Presi-
dent. Wintersmith could not help that, but when
a stampede from the galleries began he felt that
his opportunity had come. Jumping to his feet
he shouted; “Senator M*Creery is a Kentuckian,
so am I. The first man who moves out of this
gallery shall die.” All took their seats under
duress, and for more than five mortal hour’s sat
still listening to his address. When it was over, he
lowered his pistol and the crowd started. With a
gesture one man stopped the rush. “Colonel
Wintersmith,” he said, “we have stayed here
under duress at your request. Now let me ask
you a favour. Wo have been here nearly six
hours because we preferred to stay rather than bo
shot, but if this emergency ever happens again,
we ask you simply this — shoot, without any
parley.”
The O’Mara, in a very mutual-improve-
ment-association sortof speech,moved aresolution
in the Assembly lately, amid a shower of coarse
interruptions from that past-master of frivolity.
Sir John, of Clovelly, to the effect that it was in-
expedient to declare vacant the seat of any mem-
ber who might accept office as a Minister of the
Crown. The Ministry wisely supported the motion;
but, notwithstanding, it was lost. On O’Mara’s
side was common-sense and reason ; on the other
side, bunkum and pretended respect for the con-
stitution. As for Robertson, his favourite
“winged words,” “bosh I” and “rubbish 1” are
but verbal expressions for the low matter to
which his whilom intelligence and, briskness have
degenerated. As the poet somewhere says : —
“Bosh” and “rubbish” are words which, on
Robertson’s part.
Flow with damnable iteration.
His mouth doth but speak from his fullness of
That’s his conduct’s sole explanation.
Sir Geoage Campbell, who represents the
Scotch electorate of Kirkcaldy, is on® of the most
advanced Liberal < in the British Parliament. He
goes in bald-headed for Home Rule, maintaining
that no great free country ever succeeded under
very contralised institutions, and illustrating
his views by reference to the historic fact that all
the success of ancient Greece, of Switzerland, and
of tne United States has been obtained under a
localised system, the local self-governing bodies
being united for certain purposes. “ Proud as I
am of our Scotch history and character,” ho
observed, the other day, in an address to his con-
stituents, the sturdy men of Dys«rt, Kinghorn,
Burntisland, and Kirkcaldy, “ I tear that the effect
of too close contact with a gx eater country and
population is that the superior small people may
be swallowed up by the Inferior large people, and
their more high-class and perfect institutions may
be lost. I am afraid that something of this sort
has already taken place.” Sir George is quite
right. The “Inferior large people ” must be kept
in check by decentralisation.
The vast interest of labour is represented
in the British House of Commons by two mem-
bers all told, and one of these unfortunately acts
generally as decoy-duck to the capitalists. On the
other hand, the peers have no fewer than 373 re-
latives in “thePeople’s House;” the Fighting In-
terests, 168; the Landlords, 383; the Lawyers, 133;
Liquor, 18 : Money (bankers, &c.>, 35 ; Literary,
Professional, and Scientific Interests, 84; Piacemen
(past and present), 113; Railways, 113; and Trade,
Commerce and Manufactures, 155. The producing
classes, while contributing at least three-fifths of
the revenue, have certainly not more than a score
of even passable representatives The spending
classes have the rest, the fighting interest alone
making away with no less than thirty millions of
the national incomel One hundred and eighty
borough constituencies, wi-h 3,500,000 inhabitants,
return 331 members to parliament; while seventy-
one others, with 11,600,000, return only 129 repre-
sentatives ! Forty-two boroughs, with less than
7000 inhabitants, have one member each; while 178
towns, with an aggregate population of 3,630,000,
and in no case counting less than 10,000 souls, are
for voting purposes included in counties.
Thadeus of Charters Towers denounces
Griffith’s Polynesian Labourers Bill. He says :—
“ uy the expiree clause of the Act a Polynesian
who has been five years in the colony, counting
from the 1st of July next, will be a free labourer,
and can go where he pleases to seek employment.
The 30,000 Polynesians now engaged in plantation
work, supposing them to renew their engage-
ments, will be free of the colony in another three
years, and they will compete in the open market
with white men. This is not a satisfactory out-
look for the white working men. The working
men of Queensland had confidence in Mr. Griffith’s
promises that he would put an end to this slave
traffic. He has not kept his promises. He has
enabled it to strike deeper root in the colony.
Expiree Kanakas will be greedily snappf d up by all
the runholders, and no white man will be able to
get a job of work on a station. The Kanaka is
‘ reliable,’ he will submit to be ‘wolloped,’ and that
is his special charm and attraction. The Grass
Aristocracy of Queensland must have a servile
class, and Mr. Griffith by his obsequious compli-
ance with the wishes of the planters has laid the
foundation of a permanent servile class in Queens-
land.”
There’s hope for Satan, after all, providing
he hides his tail and envelops his xpofs in a
guinea pair of shoes. In fact, we are almost
tempted to assert that even Parliament is not
hopelessly damned for all eternity, because, sneak-
ing of the recent declaration of the Reid-Burdekln
polj, Gr4NNY naively observed; " Amongst those
present were several members of the Government
and of both Houses of Parliament, who, it may be
said, were quite as orderly as other sections of the
assemblage.” Mark that, now. Long Alf., the
gussex-street ’busman, who occupied such a pro-
minent position on Punph’s balcony, and cordially
acknowledged each cheer from below, as he tried
to stick the Hunter River pet’s 6 V\ hat on his
c'assic-shaped head, was not one whit more digni-
fied than the aristocratic-looking A, G. Taylor, or
the jaynyil Dan O’Connor; and the hordes of hood-
lums below looked enviously on the msnibers of
both Houses of Parliament, who, it may be said,
were quite as orderly “as even they themselves
were.” Coming from such a source as the Sydney
Morning Missionary, this is praise indeed. In
fact, so great is the compliment, that were we not
already painfully aware of the sobriety and
solemnity of the old lady wh© penned the same,
we would be inclined to think the above remarks
were, to say the least, “ sarcastic.”
Says Lahouchere in his “ Radicals and
Whigs ” :—“ There is not one single case on record
where, when the Lords have appealed to the
country against a decision of the House of Com-
mons, the verdict has gone in favour of the
former. Although rich, the Peers are no 1 ' inde-
pendent. They are, in fact, remarkable for their
abnormal greed. Because they are by the chance
of birth legislators, they insist upon decorations,
distinctions, and salaries being showered on them
and th°ir relations. In the Financial Reform
Almanack for this year there is an Interesting
calculation of the amounts that living dukes,
marquises, and earls, and their relations, and those!
that have died since 1850, have received out of the
public Exchequer. Tne dukes figure for £9,760,000,
the marquises £8,305,950, and the earls for
£48,151,393 ; total £66.347,343. The voracity of a
vestryman is nothing in comparison with that of
the British nobleman. 83 peers are priv y council-
lors ; 55 have received decorations: 193 are con-
nected with the army or navy; 63 are railway
directors; their total rental is £11,873,333, and they
possess 14,351,133 acres; yet in pay and pensions
they absorb annually £639,885, and whenever there
is a change of Administration, they clamour for
well-paid sinecures about the court and other
such sops, like a pack of hungry hounds. Les

Granville’s instructions to Gordon were in
thiswise:—To report on the military situation in
the Soudan, and on the measures which It may be
advisable to take for the security of the Egyptian
garrisons still holding positions in that country,
and for the safety of the European population In
Khartoum ; to report upon the best mode of
effecting the evacuation of the interior of the
Soudan, and upon the manner in which the safety
and the good administration by the Egyptian
Government of the ports on the sea coast can best
be secured; to pay especial consideration to the
question of the steps that may usefully be taken
to counteract the stimulus given to the slave trade
by the present insurrectionary movement; to con-
sider himself under the instructions of Her
Majesty’s agent and consul-general at Cairo, and
as authorised to perform such other duties as the
Egyptian Government may communicate to him
by Sir E. Baring. It seems that it was Granville
and Hartington, while on a visit to the Roths-
childs, who took upon themselves to summon
Gordon from Brussels to London. In town they
were joined by Dilke, Gordon made severe stipu-
lations. He must have half a million sterling at
his disposal, to buy over the chiefs; he must have
40u0 troops, if necessary, from Malta or India; and
he must be independent of his old enemy, the
Khedive Tewllk. The conditions were granted.
The Parnellite Parliamentary brigade held
a meeting early in February, at Dunlin, pre-
liminary to the opening of the session. Parnell
was elected sessional chairman; Justin M‘Carthy
sessional vice-chairman ; Leamy and Small hon.
secretaries: and E. Kodmond and E. Shell whips.
It was decided to introduce bills on the following
subjects during the coming session: Land Law
Amendment; Labourers* Act Amendment; Elec-
tive Council and County Government; Municipal
Franchise: Poor Law; Registration of Voters;
Technical Education; Fisheries; Sites for Churches,
School Teachers’ Residences, and Parochial
Houses; National Teachers; Tree Planting; Re-
clamation of Land, It was also resolved ‘'that
the party take measures to cal) attention fully to
the wanton prohibition of legal and constitutional
public meetings in Ireland, and the suppression of
free speech throughout the country, the Impunity
allowed to bodies of magistrates who have made
Eublic declarations approving of the conduct of
erd Rossmore, and deliberately inciting to illegal
acts, disorder, and violence, and the continuance
of the policy of forced emigration of thx people;
to move for a commission of inquiry to inquire
Into the dispositions of the property held by the
suppressed trade guilds in Ireland: and to warn the
public in America, in Australia, and on the Conti-
nent against placing reliance upon intelligence
concerning Irish affairs telegraphed abroad by
English news agencies.”
Sir John Lubbock to the February number
of the Fortnightly contributes “Liberal versus
Conservative Finance,” whence the following: —
“The late Conservative Government incurred
special liabilities for the Russo-Turkish and South
African wars of £13,385,000. only £1,185,000 of which
they paid out of taxes, while they raised £7,850,000
by borrowing, to which must be added £5,000 000
towards the expense of the Afghan war. The
present Administration have not only paid the
whole of the extra war expenditure incurred dur-
ing the last three years for the Egyptian and
South African wars, amounting to £6,500,000, but
have also liquidated at least £7,000,000 of the debt
left by their predecessors. The account, therefore,
will stand as follows : The Conservatives incurred
extra war expenditure amounting to £13,385,000,
while they paid £4,185,000. The Liberals incurred
extra war expenditure amounting to £6,100,000,
while they paid £13,000,000. Again, the present
Government has had a substantial, if moderate,
surplus every year, while in the three last Con-
servative years the deficiencies were respectively
£3,600,000, £3,300,000, and £3,800,000. Or, take again
the state of our debt. The annual reduction when
Sir Stafford came into office was over £6,000,000.
This he considered insufficient, and he therefore
brought in a Bill to increase it. So much for
principle; but in practice, during the six years of
the Conservative Administration, the actual re-
demption of debt was at the rate of £3,000,000 a
year. During the three years of the present
Government it has been at the rate of £6,800,000 a
year, while this year it will probably exceed
£8,000,000. Lastly, as regards expenditure, it Is
true that the estimates for 1883-4 as compared with
1879-80 show an nominal increase of £3,000,000. Wo
have, however, to deduct the extra amount
devoted to debt £1,436,000, that for grants in aid
£900,000, and Post Office £1,675,000, which amount
to £4,031,000 ; so that, after allowing for the
nominal Increase of £3,000,000, we get a difference
in favour of 1884 of more than £1,000,000.”

WHERE TO INVEST I
IN THE CLIVE ESTATE,
RIVERSTONE.
Because the high price brought by city pro-
perty causes purchasers to go further afield.
CLIVE ESTATE,
Situated in the busy and prosperous township
of Riverstone, being only twenty odd miles from
Sydney. This locality is favourhbly known as a
health-giving and invigorating district, its salu-
brious atmosphere being universally recognised,
rendering the settlement the most desirable in the
colony: possessing the advantages of direct city
communication, a thriving and increasing trade,
with the luxury and retirement of country life. The
Railway accomodation is excellent, there being
five passenger trains a day, with extra accomoda-
tion on Wednesday and Saturday, besides numer-
ous goods trains daily, and additional trains will
be run as occasion requires. This Estate offers
facilities superior to any in the market. The
land holds an elevated position, and is beautifully
watered by an extensive creek, guarded with high
banks covered with nutritious verdure, containing
an inexhaustible quantity of water; in the driest
season the supply of the limped dementis prolific,
as clear as the crystal spring of an enchanted glen,
and shedding a balmy influence over the district.
There is neither rock nor gully to be found
throughout the entire property, and the remark-
able growth and production on this and the sur-
rounding farms, vineyards, and orang eries satis-
factorily prove the unmistakable fertility of the
soil. This Estate has been partly cultivated, and
consists of productive, loamy soil, on which nutri-
tious pasturage, and, in fact, all vegetation,
abounds in luxuriant profusion. Two residences
erected are at present occupied, and numerous
others are projected. The Railway Station is with-
in a few yards, and the road leading therefrom on
to the property is well metalled, and a substantial
Bridge crosses the Creek, from which a Govern-
ment road leads through a public reserve directly
into the main road of the Estate, 100 feet wide,
and laid out on the latest scientific principles for
the enhancement of the property, rendering it a
model township, which must rapidly rise in archi-
tectural beauty and intrinsic value. The sur-
roundings of the property materially assist the
favourable aspect, being bounded on the west by
the property of Mr. W. Stevenson; on the east by
the Township, Hotels, Stores, and Railway Station;
on the south by extensive Crown reserves, with
old-established vineyards adjoining; on tne north
by pasture land, with works in the rear belonging
to Mr. Richards. Vast strides have been made in
the improvement of this district within the past
twelve months, and business and population have
increased, a public school erected, and a great
number of new buildings have been erected; and
numerous residences and stores are rising every
day. To show the honafldes of the foregoing in-
adequate description of the many advantages
possessed by this property, intending purchasers
are particularly urged to personally inspect the
land, and to buyers of 10 lots and upwards the
return railway fare will be refunded. In conclu-
sion, it would be urged that this is not a specula-
tion, but will prove to investors a provision for
the present and future.
A HOME NOW,
AND
A VALUABLE LEGACY WORTH LEAVING
TO THE WIFE OB CHILDREN,
Until recently, none but (the affluent were able
to become freeholders of their native land, such
luxury being alone for the wealthy classes; but
under the present administration in this glorious
land of New South Wales, deservedly known as
THE GARDEN OF THE WORLD,
there is no excuse for the poorest man paying ex-
travagant rentals, for he is enabled to become the
owner of the land he cultivates and the homestead
that shelters him. Remember, Sixpence a week
tor 90 weeks secures a piece of Land that will en-
able you to become the owner of a valuable site
for Business Purposes or Villa Residence, for
Garden Produce or Poultry Raising, and within
the next lew years become valuable beyond ths
most sanguine anticipations. This is an invest-
ment without risk—the first steps towards pros-
perity and wealth—and particularly reoommeded
to young married couples, either for farming
their homestead, or an purposes, a site for
Investment for their children.
Notice.—Only until the 25th Inst, will these
Allotments be sold at 45s., after which date the
remainder, if any, will be 50s. an Allotment.

WHAT TO INVEST IN I
WHF INVEST I
HOW INVEST I
WHEN TO INVEST I
WHERE TO INVEST !
WHAT TO INVEST IN I
LAND! Because so long: as the colony advances
land cannot decrease in value.
LAND! Because its acquisition is the first step
towards prosperity and position.
LAND! Because you can build a house and
save the exorbitant price charged for house rent.
LAND1 Because by so doing you can leave a
legacy to your children that is always increasing
in vaiue.
LAND I Because, should your inclinations so
lie, you can cultivate Farm or Garden pioduce,
or direct your attention to that most profitable
and pleasing occupation of raising poultry, the
demand for such being ever increasing, and the
pursuit of which will give healthful recreation to
yourself and family.
WHY INVEST!
Because you never know when reverses may
come, and money that is invested in land is always
secure. Because a man who is a landed proprietor
is a better Citizen, a better Husband, and a better
Father.
WHEN TO INVEST I
Now that Land is at a low price, in consequence
of money being tight, large buyers are not inclined
to invest, and thus allow small capitalists to secure
some of the good things of this world. NOW!
Because Land can never bo cheaper than it is at
the present time. NOW! Because the rapid
Increase in population must create a demand for
new settlements. NOW! Because you are earning
good wages, and a few shillings a week will never
be missed by you. NOW1 Because the shillings
invested at present will rapidly grow into pounds.
HOW TO INVEST !
In Land in Small Allotments that have been
laid out by the practical agents whose experience
teaches them where increase in vame is likely to
ensue, and whose interest; is identical with the
purchasers’ to advance the value of land they are
selling.
WHY INVEST IN SMALL ALLOTMENTS ?
Because the property has been chosen by practi-
cal men with a view to its utility. Because the
blocks are laid out on a scientific principle con-
ducive to sanitary comfort and advantageous
position. Because, the roads having been given,

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatre Royal— “The Silver King” p.8
Opkba House—“ Friendship” ib.
Yes; it was something like a house at the
Royal on Saturday night to see the loug-talked-of
“Silver King.” Various similes suggest them-
selves -herrings in a barrel, snakes in liourke,
loafers at the Albert statue—but they’ve all been
so hackneyed by reporters that we shall content
ourselves with saying that the place was full. And it
would be sate to predict that there will be no fall-
ing off for some time. The play is sensational, but
the story is simplicity Itself. It is a story of a
man’s remorse and a woman’s faithfulness. It is
crowded with incidents—sorrowful, gay, gro-
tesque. There is a bar where horsey-men con-
gregate to congratulate themselves in Seven
Dials’ English on their successful rascali-
ties or lament their losses in maudlin blas-
phemy- But here we noticed a grave omission.
Among the bar customers who bet and swore and
swilled there was an entire absence of Hebrews—
of men with large pins, frowsy linen, and bent
beaks. Su rely, now that Hanlan is in town, and as a
consequence the city plethoric with Australian
rooks, it wouldbe possible for the management to
give additional vrateemblance to the piece by enga-
ging a dozen or two well-known “ welchers” just
to loaf round for flats ?
* * *
Of the story itself, we intend to give but
the merest outline. Mad with drink, Denver fol-
lows Ware—an old sweetheart of his wife—threat-
ening to kill him. He finds his way to Ware’s
house, but some burglars have been there before
him. They chloroform him, chuck him in a
corner, and proceed with their work. Ware re-
turns. They murder him with Denver’s pistol,
and decamp. Denver awakes, sees the dead body
of Ware, recognises his own recently-discharged
pistol, and, of course, concludes that, in his
drunkenness, he had carried out his threat and
done for his former rival. So the story develops,
plot and counterplot thicken, Denver escapes to
America, makes a fortune, returns to England,
and, having received a hint that he was not the
real assassin, devotes all histimeto clearing up the
mystery. He is successful and recovers bis place
in society, while the law takes an uncomfortably
firm grip of those for whose crime he had suffered
so long
• • •
Mr. G. S. Titheradg© took the part of
Denver. It is a trying one, and requires capacity
of a high order for its proper pourtrayal. If ap-
plause is an unfailing test of success, he should
feel satisfied, for the marks of appreciation were
frequent and noisy. His remorse when first on
his half-muddled brain the conviction dawned that
he was a murderer, and his subsequent parting
from his wife, belong to phases of acting
which are seldom found in connection with
what are popularly known as “sensational
pieces.” From start to finish—whether mouthing
drunken threats against Ware, throwing a table-
cover over the glazed eyes of his supposed victim,
holding his wife at arm’s length lest she should ■
kiss an assassin, or, as the Silver King, endeavour- I
ing to atone for the crime committed during
his madness—he is consistently realistic. And his
wife, too —Miss Mayor I Like her husband, she
takes a good firm hold of your sympathies—as-
suming that you possess such things—at the begin-
ning, and keeps possession of them to the end.
When she returns them, vou feel, somehow, that
they are none the worse for the temporary loan.
Why men with wives like Annie Mayor, and chil-
dren like Cissy and Ned (the young Sherwoods),
should slobber round bars, and supply funds to
billiard-sharpers, magsmen, and miscellaneous
pot-wollopers, who should be fracturing granite
m provincial gaols or storing electric batteries by
« padding the hoof ” on tread-mills, is one of those
questions for which a solution will only be found
when a satisfactory reason is given why British
workmen have to support, in luxurious idleness, a
mob of well-bred male and female loafers who
would not touch the ’orny-’anded's digits without
a shudder. » » ■
And little Cissy—Ned, too, for the matter
of that—deserves a par. all to herself. She is such
a consequential little woman, trips along so appa-
rently unconscious of the thousands of admiring
eyes focussed on her from the front, emphasizes
her words so daintily, and behaves altogether in
such a self-possessed, intelligent fashion, that the
matrons in the audience look as if they would like
to cry over her, or cover her tiny face with as
many kisses as they could scroodge into such a
limited area, and the men as if to them all pleasure
would be commonplace compared with that of
filling her pockets with shillings and her mouth
with gingerbread.
• i • •
The are two burglars in the piece, repre-
senting the head and tail of that useful fraternity.
Captain Skinner (Mr. Ireland)—the “ Spider ” is his
professional title-is one, and Cripps (Mr. Leake)
the other. The Captain does the fancy work, and
Cripps the rough rnd tumble. Neither is to be
trifled with—you can see that from the start.
Cripps is good enough for a bit of plain sweeping,
but he couldn't sweep round a lamp-post. When
delicate jobs like that have to be done, the
“ Spider ” has to take the matter in hand. The
latter is the Johnathan Wild and the other the
Bill Sykes of his calling. And Bill not only looks
a professional man, but is proud of his looks. Und
well up in the little traditions of his department—
the nice points of precedence aud etiquette in
which amateur marauders so lamentably fail.
He knows his duty and performs it—tak-
ing eare that others perform theirs. When
disturbed in his business—when the owner of
valuables comes sliding down stairs in his robe do
nuit, and objects to the removal of his silver with-
out his written consent, why, of course he must
put up with the consequences of trying to inter-
fere with a man’s living. Cripps is prepared to
argue with him—he’s a reasonable fellow is Cripps
—but some men have no sense of humour. They
make for the bell, and—well, Bill is prepared for
that, too, and prospects their anatomy before they
are half across the room. The amount of chin
bristles rank tobacco, and ready ribaldry men
engaged in the burgling business appear to hive
always on hand has for a long time seemed to us
one of the pleasantest characteristics of their call-
iDg ‘ • • •
Oh, and there’s a marine store dealer, Elijah
Coombes (Mr. Redwood), who is useful in many
ways to the “ Spider ( ” and his mate. Indeed, but
for him, it is not easy to see how they could
get along. The business would be so slack that
it is really diflioult to guess what they could
do except come to Australia and go into one
of the colonial legislatures. But he saves them
from that by “smashing” the swag. He, too,
knows his business, and a good deal about other
people’s. And he is a hardened villain—a regular
out-and-outer, who would think no more ot shov-
ing you over the Thames embankment on a foggy
night, than an Irish landlord of shifting the roof
of your house, if you objected to pay rent. The
number of utter rascals, not only on the boards,
but in real life, who are named Elijah, has always
struck us as singular. Only one of the breed ever
came to any good—the chap that drove off in the
blazing buggv. We’ve often thought how tanta-
lia ngly meagre our information was of this “ biz.”
Depend upon it, he didn’t leave before he
“scooped the pool” in some way not referred to
in the sacred records.
• • *
There was a “ tipsy passenger,” on the bill,
and 4 to 1 was freely offered by a hook-nosed party
behind us that he would be a Kelt. He was—a
Milesian of the purest descent: one whose pro-
genitors bad lent a hand in serving out “ teko ” to
the Danes at Clontarf and later to the Orangemen
at New Ross and Vinegar Hill. Harry Leston per-
sonated the exile, and we will say this of Harry
that when we went to the Royal on Saturday night
we were a little “off colour”—a bit thoughtful and
homicidal. We’d been reading of a Paris restaura-
teur who the other day objected to buy some
rabbits—refused to take them as a gift—for fear
his customers should discover that they’d been
wolfing cats since Waterloo. There was a bad
taste on our mouth, and the future seemed a
blank. But this “ tipsy passenger” cheered us up.
Of course he was not at all necessary in the piece
—had nothing to do but carry a stick with a
red bundle at the end of it and goad the officials
to a state of madness with his irritatingly irrelevant
questions. But he soon became the gallery’s first
favourite, and kept up a pleasant simmer of satis-
faction till he was finally run out by the slack by
the outraged officers. And just here it is as well
to state that the stage Irishman Is undergoing a
gradual but certain change. The knee-breeches,
pipe, and red waistcoat are giving way before ad-
vancing civilization. He still retains the stubbly
beard, black eye, damaged hat, and partiality for
raw spirits with which we are so familiar, but his
penchant for chipping pieces off his neighbours’
skulls, or twisting himself Into unnatural posi-
tions when itinerant fiddlers strike up “ Rory
O’Mooro,” is perceptibly subsiding. Nor is he so
seditious as formerly. Some time ago, you re-
member, whenever a person from Cura or Tip-
perary appeared before the footlights, he was
generally in possession of a blunderbuss, filled
pretty well to the muzzle with miscellaneous pro-
jectiles, which he was bent on transferring to the
first landlord or tithe-proctor coming his way.
This game appears to be out of season now, or get-
ting scarce, so that one source of innocent relaxa-
tion is being cut off from the poor, struggling
“ Kelt.” Still, with all these drawbacks, be sure and
keep your seat at the “ Silver King ” while Leston
is on—if only to see what real fun can be extracted
from an insignificant part by a capable man.
* * *
There are a number of other people in the
“ Silver King,” but we haven’t room for the lot
this time. We must, however, speak of one more,
Jaikes (Mr. Day), an old family servitor of Mr.
Denvers. We left him last, but, as a matter of
fact, the character is about as important as that of
the Silver King himself, and Mr. Day served it up
to us in a way that we make bold to say no other
actor in Australia could—yes, equal. With the
remembrance of his “ play-acting ” fresh upon us,
we say “equal” in preference to “excel.” The
way he subducted his coat-tails, and presented to
the struggling fire that anatomical configuration
it is equally improper to offer to a friend or an
enemy, brought back to us the liveliest recollec-
tions of days gone by, and the pleasure we often
derived from a similar proceeding in foggy London.
And the assumed cheerfulness of the old boy as
his mistress and he gradually went down from
venison to tripe—and not much of that—from
generous hock to cold water I Again, the way the
unimpressionable “ancient” received the ad-
vances of Mrs. Gammage (Miss Melville), his old-
time sweetheart, before she went through three
husbands, kept up a feu dejoie of guffaws, starting
from the man who banged the cymbals in the
orchestra and winding up with a smudgy-faced
apple-orange-and-lemonade man in the gallery.
* * * *
“No. 47, or Ifot Guilty,” is the name of
the piece now on at the Academy of Music. In
the bills it is announced as “an emotional and
spectacular drama, with entirely new and elabor-
ate scenery, &c. &c.” We went to see It, the other
night, and are still alive. It nearly knocked us
out in the fourth round, but, by dodging some of
the heaviest long-arm jokes, we managed to stay,
and were rewarded with half the gate money.
The play might be worse, to begin with; and,
when we say that the scenery and some of the
acting are about on a par with each other, we do
so in the hope that neither the artists who painted
the one, nor the actors who did the other, will die
from the effects of flattery. It is rumoured that
the scenery was painted by moonlight with a sage
brush and that the artists were two blind men
from Melbourne; if this be true, it certainly
reflects great credit upon them, for it isn’t every
blind man that can paint that way by moonlight.
• • •
The plot of the play is laid all over one
half of the globe, including England, France,
South Africa, India, the high seas, and Australia.
Tc we wanted tolbe sarcastic, we would say that if
the scenery were a little better the piece might
pass as a holiday entertainment at a Deaf and
Dumb Asylum; and that, It the language were
considerably improved upon, it would make a
good show for blind men. But we don’t want to
be sarcastic, and therefore the remark is withheld.
Act 1 is confined to England, and for aught we
know the author of it is confined there, too. We
hope he is, if he is a fighting man, for our bull-dog
has gone into the country to visit some relatives.
(N.B.—He will be back early to-morrow morning).
Just before the curtain rose, the orchestra, con-
sisting of a piano, a fiddle, and a horn, struck up a
symphonv that sounded something like a cross
between the morning chaunt of a love-sick mule
and the howl of an orphan hyena.
♦ * *
Robert Arnold (Mr. William South) is the
hero of the play. The spectators are first intro-
duced to him as he is standing on the Southhamp-
ton Quay, amongst a lot of army recruits, who are
bound for India. Robert is a locksmith, but is
going to India to accept a clerkship in the army.
While they are all merry over their beer, Silas
Jarrett (Mr. Joe Stark) steals liobert’s basket
of tools, and extracts from it a bunch of skele-
ton keys, with which he presently effects
a robbery by dim lights to slow music. He then
leaves the tool-basket, the keyr, and a portion of
the stolen property in a room where Robert is
subsequently found. Robert is accused of the
theft, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to seven
years’ penal servitude at Dartmoor. He escapes
with another prisoner named Jack Snipe (Mr. Sam
Howard), and together they make their way to
India, where Robert learns that he has been par-
doned, and he assumes his clerkship. Of course
he falls in love, and has a terrible time of it for
several years, but finally he gets back to England,
the villain is identified as the thief who stole the
pocket-book, Jack Snipe, who has turned over a
new leaf, receives a full pardon, Robert marries
the girl of his choice, and the whole business
winds up like a new music-box.
♦ ♦ *
Mr. Sam Howard, as Jack Snipe, is the
life of the performance In the prison scene he
was made-up for the grave-digger in “ Hamlet,”
with the grave left out. His jokes and quips, some
of which were interpolations, were immensely en-
joyed by the audience. In this scene he introduces
a song entitled “Jack in a Box,” and sings it
in a merry, knowing way that suggests the
idea that H he isn’t in gaol he ought to be.
Mr. South, as Robert Arnold (No. 47), lacked vim
an 1 fire. He was lively enough in the first scene,
but getting into gaol and falling in love (both
great calamities) seemed to knock all the sand out
of him, and made him look like the good young
man that died. If ho would brace up a little and
pull down his vest, he might add more dignity to
the part for which he is cast Mr. Joe Stark, who
doubled for Silas Jarrett and Captain Willoughby,
was particularly happy in assuming the character
of the drunken vagabond. H*s make-up was per-
fect. In fact, he looked so drunk that the audience
could almost smell his breath. As a villain, too,
he seemed in his element; but he will have
to learn to carry his sword as though it were
something besides a cane-knife, before he can
play the role of Captain. Triggs, the lawyer’s
clerk, would have looked better if he had taken
rue precaution to pare down his ears. They loo ted
entirely too heavy to be hung on sa weak a head
as Triggs is represented to have. Miss Blanche
Murray, as Polly, was lively and vivacious, and
her conception of the part quite appropriate. She
kisses rather much for a well-conducted soubrette,
but No. 47 was as much to blame for that as any-
body. A plea of ‘‘Not Guilty” need not be
entered here, for it won't stand. Miss Marie
Wilton, who doubled for Margaret Armitage and
her daughter Alice, was equally pleasing in the
one as in the other character. Marie always looks
nice, but we like her best as Ophelia. She’s
drowned as Ophelia. Taken as a whole, the play
is worth witnessing, if only to hear Jack Snipe’s
jokes and to see Polly sit down in the second act.
* * * *
At the Opera House the Majeronis are
ladling out “ Friendship, or the Two Sergeants.”
W e believe there was a good house on Saturday
night, when we were not there, and we know there
was an indifferent one on Monday, when we were.
Yet why it should have been so slender-except
that the piece is well-known in Sydney, and the
superior novelty at the Koyal seduced the public
that way—we are at alossjtosay. One “motif”
runs through the piece—the struggle between
affection and duty in the breast of Wil-
liam (Signor Majeroni). To this key all is at-
tuned. Still, there are many side issues which
are made the most of in the hands of capable
subordinates. Mr. Musgrave’s corporal of artil-
lery, for instance, causes a not unpleasant diver-
sion from the otherwise sombre surroundings.
Oddly enough, there is an important part allotted
to a boy—a mere child—just as in the “Silver
King,” a part of equal importance is in the hands
of another child — this time a girl. Young
Maieroni—a bright little chap of six or seven—did
what he had to do so accurately, archly, and with
such an evident understanding of what it all
meant, that he fairly shared the honours with his
parents.
* * *
In our day, when the high sense of honour
that was supposed to have been peculiar to the
ancien regime before the little Corsican bandit
played nine-pins with European thrones Is said to
be everywhere on the decline, the desire of William
to leave his wife and kids and return to his regi-
ment to be shot is slightly peculiar. Under similar
circumstances, we know people who would stay at
home, or, if they took the trip at all, would avoid
the barracks—go the other way, in fact,—pop
aboard a vessel going on a whaling voyage or
coming out to Botany Bay. It’s bad enough to be
a soldier returning from furlough with the pro-
spect of a month’s “ setting-up ” drill before you
to banish from your system the awkwardness
induced by a couple of months’ loafing; but to be
returning with a knowledge that a platoon of your
comrades is awaiting at the other end to let day-
light through you, is about as cheering as to wake
up in the morning after a wild night to find Your
pockets empty and no tick at the “ pub.”
• • •
The Marie of Signora Majeroni is a fine
performance. Her endeavours to learn from her
husband the secret weighing him down, and her
struggles to prevent his departure made many of
the audience look stonily about them as if they
would like to take a fall out of somebody and
didn’t know whom. By the hysterical way they
laughed when Corporal Valentine worked in
some little pleasantries it could be seen how
nearly they had approached the border-land
of pocket-handkerchiefs and general damp-
ness when the Majeronis were on the scene. As
Marshal d’Altaville, Mr. Glover, notwithstanding
a bell-topper hat instead of a chaco, looked and
spoke ever so much better than the Field-Mar-
shals who attended our drawing-rooms when we
were in society—better than George of Cambridge
—than even the redoubtable “Wales,” whoso
baton, ns everyone knows, was obtained through
good honest service in the field of—Venus.
“Friendship” is only on for a week’s run. On
Saturday “ The Living Statue ” and “ A Kiss ” are
promised. We mayn t be there for the “Statue,”
hut if there’s any of the other kicking round drop
us a line.

What is Sheridan doing ? Well, at the be-
ginning of last month (February) he was subsi-
dising a troop of United States cavalry to keep
back the crush to his “Lear” and “Louis XI.,” at
the California Theatre, San Francisco. This is
what the Daily Examiner of that bustling town
says of him : —“ ‘Louis XI ’ introduced him to
San Francisco, and won him that high place among
actors from which no succeeding performances
have dislodged him, . . . One of the most
positive virtues of his elocution is a rarely perfect
enunciation, which makes it a delight to listen to
his speech.” If we know but little about the
Daily Examiner, we know a good deal about
Sheridan. Of two things we are certain—that he
had no hand in that critique in the first place, and,
next, that, even if he had, there is not a commen-
datory word in it to which his Australian per-
formances do not entitle him.

PEPPER AND SALT.
Last Wednesday week a most “ rekerky ”
concert was held at Ashfleld, in connection with
the Never-Touch-It Lodge, 15,556, Mr, Hutchinson,
the Worthy G.W.C.T.X.Y.Z., being in the chair.
And our own exclusive musical “cricket* hap-
pened to have the “ jumps ” very bad that night,
and we are Indebted to the Novello who slings
concert critiques for the Noozh for the following
scholarly notice, which appeared on Friday last 1
A duet was “nicely given.” Mr. Barton was in
“good voice.” Miss Hathway sang “very well.”
Mr. Gould sang “very nicely.” Miss Weber (ap-
parently went one better, as she) sang “very
nicely indeed.” A duet was “ greatly appreciated.”
Miss Smith sang “ Erin on the Rhine ” (companion
to “Erln-go-bragh,” we presume,) in “good style."
Messrs. Slayton and Gould sang “very well.” Miss
Weber and Mr. Barton sang “very nicely.” Mr.
Gould “ sang in good style.” Miss Hathway was
*ln good voice,” and a quartette was “loudly
applauded,” Such nattering notices as the above
are the strongest Incentives for the encourage-
ment of true genius that one can well imagine,
and must assuredly fill the heart of every true
musician with a fierce desire to get hold of an axe
and belt Fish River caves in the head of the born
natural genius who wrote them.

When Max Adeler described the Republican
Army of General Flynn as consisting of 135 men,
22 of whom were brigadier-generals, no doubt he
thought he had struck a patch of side-splitting and
original humour; but, from an answer given by
the Premier to Mr. Withers, the other night, it
appears that Majah Cracknell’s Torpedo Corps runs
Misther Flynn’s brigade moighty closely, for,
according to Mr. Stuart, there are Just 75 full
privates in the gallant Torpedo squad, and these
are bossed by 23 officers—viz., 1 majah, 1 captain.
4 lieutenants, 7 sergeants, and 10 corporals! That
is to say, an officer to every four soldiers, and a
fraction of a warrior over,—the said fraction
forming a sort of emergency squad, very useful
in time of war or making surprise attacks on
the canteen department.

For once in his life, David Buchanan threw
out an extremely sensible suggestion when he
proposed that whenever one hon. member insulted
another the pair were to be locked up in a room
with a pistol eaeh, and left there until one, or
better still, both, fell dead. The great drawbacks
to this, however, would be the unseemly noise
occasioned and the sinful waste of good powder
on such worthless objects. We think we can im-
prove on Dawvld’s plan by copying the style of
duel recently fought in Strasburg. Two students,
it appears, fell up to their ears in love with the
same lady, and as the law didn’t allow her to
marry both, the lovers agreed to fight it out in a
private bedroom, an old army doctor being the
sole secondThere were no firearms visible,
only a black, morocco case, from which the doctor
drew forth a pill-box. It contained four pellets,
one of which was destined to cause instant death,
the remaining three being harmless. The two men
agreed to the mode of ‘duelling’ proposed. A
gold piece was tossed in the air to decide who
would have the first choice. Two of the pellets
were swallewed, and then the piece was tossed
again for the other two, which the doctor Insisted
should be swallowed by both the principals at the
same moment. A draught of claret washed them
down, and the next instant one of the young men
fell forward in the last agony,” There you are.
Dr. Tarrant or Dr. Creed could fix up the pellets.
All we require now is the necessary pluck on the
part of our honorable members. Take the physic,
Johnnie.

The Rev. D. S. M Eachran, of Melbourne,
presided at one of Booth and Glover’s temperance
gatherings, the other evening, and delivered an
address. Mac., you will remember, has been play-
fully referred to by one of his brother divines, as
a “mixture of Pecksniff and Uriah Hoep,” and
really, there was something about the good
gentleman’s address which did remind one of
“ Ury It was so “ ’umble.” The “ mixture ”
commenced his harangue with the explanation
that “ he was present not as a pledged teetotaller,
but as a practical abstainer .” It’s evident that
Mac. doesn’t believe in pledged teetotallers always
abstaining, you see—but no matter. Then he gave
his reasons for renouncing wine and “ whusky,”
and they were two-fold: “ first, he had discovered
by experience, some time ago, that he had no need
for wine or strong drink [and he a Presbyterian
minister, too —well, well 1—Ed.B.], and secondly <
because by abstaining he was able to do some good
for his fellow-men. He did not wish to force his
Views upon others, but held that ho had a right to
set them up as a guide for others.” Now, there’s
’umbleness for you, if you like. But let us sing
altogether:
Ho lets his fellow-mien be free
To act just as they choose,
And has (dear, modest soul I), you see,
No wish to “ force his views;”
But still, the lowly man maintains—
With honest, holy pride—
“ He has a right to set ’em up
For others—as a guide.”

If a man were dying, what would you
give him ? Give him up, of course. They hold
different opinions, however, in Otago—a town
which is in New Zealand, if fire and brimstone
from Heaven have not consumed it since the last
mail came in. A candidate for a public position-
says the local paper, but does not say what posi-
tion, and leaves us in the dark as to whether it
was the borough membership or town dustman-
ship—was addressing a meeting there lately.
Several questions were put to him by the enlight-
ened electors, to all of which he answered with
more or less satisfaction. At last a man got up
and gravely propounded this one:—“If a man was
dying, which would you give him, a glass of grog
or a leg of mutton ?” The audience waited in
solemn and earnest silence for the candidate’s
reply. He was a long time thinking over it—the
question had completely staggered his intellect.
At last he feebly answered, “I would give him a
glass of water,” a rejoinder which was received
with yells of derision. We have not heard whether
the candidate got the position he wanted or not’ J
nor do we wish to hear. But this anecdote is sug.
gestive—everything Is suggestive to a mind like
ours. If ono of our Parliamentary candidates
were asked what he would give to a dying man*
what should be his reply ? Don’t know ? Well,
it’s very easy. He should reply, “ I would give
him a card to vote forme on election day.” You’ve
got to know something about politics to under-
stand this.

TO A PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE.
So, good man, you are aspiring
To direct the Ship of Stale ?
What gifts (s?y) are you requiring,
Do you think, to legislate ?
You are rich and very stupid ;
You are smart without a cent. ;
A or a Cupid ;
You’re the man for Parliament.
You are madder than a hatter,
Or, we’ll say, than a March hare—
Bless your heart, it doesn’t matter,
You'll find kindred spirits there.
And your ignorance is thorough—
You’re a chutf-head from the jump 1
All the better for j our borough,
All the more for the town-pump.
And you thought some little knowledge
Of law-making, you might need ?
Q o to! Bedlam is the college 1
You were innocent indeedI
fou would trifle with the Graces!?
Read the records of old time ?
Pish! sit down and make grimaces:
Parliament’s a pantomime.
You will get them—it’s a foeus
For such imbeciles as you—
If you’ll say this hocus-pocus.
And as we direct you, do.
Tell the free, and the enlightened,
That you’re damned if they are free;
Don’t be flurried, don’t be frightened.
Be as coarse as coarse can be.
Say that Capital is sitting
Like a nightmare on their chests,
While they lie there, all unwitting—
Throw in here some scurvy jests!—
“ When you think of it, you burn—you
Boll with anger and with pain”—
Swear right here, if they return you,
You will d d soon break the chain.
“ As for those who griped and wrung them,”
You will—“they will see—’tis well I”
Say now you were born among them—
That is always sure to tell.
Say the honour overcomes you
When you speak t® them—the pride;
And the scrapings of the slums you
Will at once have at your side.
Say you are disinterested,
You’re a horny-hand yourself;
Say your rival (or suggest it)
Is just going for the pelf.
Say that nought could be absurder
Than such man as candidate;
Hint he was in gaol for murder,
But forget to give the date.
Then, to make the thing dead certain,
Get a graveyard vote or two;
And you’re in—and precious dirt in I—
Hero’s our next advice to you.
Never care for Honour’s laurels,
Never look into a book,
From the burglar get your morals,
Get your grammar from the cook.
Listen in the lanes and alleys,
In the dens of dirt and vice—
Pick up there your pleasant sallies—
Be not, prithee, over-nice.
Let your eyes with envy green be,
Let your teeth be green with slime,
Foul and faithless and obscene be.
To the mouth with malice prime I
Folks will call your foulness funny.
Call your malice speaking plain—
Sling the muck around then, sonny,
Smoking from your dunghill-brain.
Any lie to undermine a
Reputation fair to view;
For the Venus Cloacina
Is the goddess meant for you.
When, perchance, you hear men utter
Noble thoughts, pray be not weak!
Rise and quench them in the gutter,
Let the ordure in you speak 1
•o to all men you’ll be hateful—
In itself a source of pride—
When you see us, if your grateful,
Pass upon the other side!

This is what we call heart-rending pathos.
An old gentleman died over in Melbourne last
month, and, after giving the particulars, this is
what the death-notice said “ After serving his
church in the capacity of sexton faithfully and
assiduously for twenty-three years, died, aged 74.
and was buried like an alien, unwept, unhonoured,
and unsung.” Very sad, very sorrowful, this 1
How it must have embittered the last moments of
the old man to think that his successor, who was a
poor creature, and knew nothing about his busi-
ness-all successors to old men are like this—would
perhaps bury him wrong side up, so that he would
be smothered before he was in the grave half-an-
hour, ©r, may be, cut a hole in his skull with the
spade while making room for another retired
gentleman. We can sympathise with this feeling.
We never think of our own demise without a
spasm of emotion as we reflect on the improba-
bility of anyone being left behind us who is able
to spell. It is a harrowing thing to think that when
we die our name may be misspelt on the grave-
stone. How in thunder, if this happens, our soul
will be able to find our body at the Ressurrection,
is more than we know. It would be a nice thing
if, after a life of blameless virtue and a death of
sinless peace, we were at the last day to pick up
the body of, say David Buchanan, and be damned
for ever, without enq uiry, the minute we presented
ourselves. Or suppose we did not make such a
disastrous mistake, but picked up the body of a
Christian, there would be an action for theft against
us at once which would settle our hash for all
eternity. It is these considerations—which may
appear trilling to the thoughtless—which make us
shudder when we look forward to our decease. So
we can feel for the poor sexton. Still we don’t
think he has so much to complain about. A sexton
dying has many advantages over other men en-
gaged in the same occupation. He has more
acquaintances among the dead. Intact, when you
come to consider the matter, you will see that a
sexton must necessarily feel lonesome among the
living. There was one feature of this case puzzled
us for a while. Wo thought it was an established
fact in natural history that sextons never die
Neither do they; but it appears this old gentleman,"
in a moment of weakness, gave up his position,
and, of course, immediately became mortal. Our
sextons nev;r die—they disappear, not as the irre-
verent Harmy singers say Elij ih did “in a fiery
van,” but in a shroud of grey mist, and become
perpetual correspondents to the Town and Coun-
try Journal. Yet the sorrow of this hapless
Melbourne stiff-seoreter dying “unwept, un-
honoured, and unsung," haunts us. Why unwept ?
Had he not a mourning mother to bend over the
bier of her clay-cold child, and cry bitterly?
Where was his uncle, the country editor ? Perhaps
he could not get bail in time to attend. Hapless
sexton. Perished in the heyday of his youth, with
none to drop even a door-scraper over him I A
sorry masque this thing they call life, gentlemen !
But unsung ? It shall not be said that he died
unsung while our palsied lingers can draw music
out of a washboard. Listen
A SIGH FOR THE SBXTON.
Sigh for the sexton I Low he lies,
The earth is heaped up over his head;
Little cares he who sells or buys,
Little he cares for the price of bread.
Stiff he lies in the silent tomb—
There we shall all lie, poor and rich;
Crowded in where there isn’t room
To scratch your leg if it chance to itch.
Nothing to drink there, nought to smoke;
Nothing to pass the time away;
No one there that will crack a joke—
Dull as the Shroud till Judgment Day.
One bone falls on the other bone,
Then the bald skull falls in between—
What did you weigh, sir ? Fourteen stone ?
Good Lord, you now look devilish lean I
Crossed in love, were ?—poor old bones !—
Keep calm, we beg of you—calm and quiet—
Do not speak in these strident tones,
This is no place for rant and riotl
Sigh for the sexton—three times three!
And now your grief in the goblet sink!
This is a truth—if a truth there be—
No man is dead while he can drink!
* * *
We have some correspondents for whom
a grave in a dingo-preserve is too good. What
they take us for is to us a mystery, but we think
they must take us for a cask of cement. Every
week we get dredge-loads of letters containing
measely stories of the “ this-little-pig-went-to-
market” style of humour, which the writers ex-
pect us to print. Then the town fool sends us
something about the baker and his girl, and asks
us to “ give them a turn.” Goodness knows how
proud and gorgeously pleased we should be to do
this, if we had them entangled in a circular saw,
but, otherwise, it is a matter of stony indifference
to us if they had all been hanged three centuries
before the Christian era—that is, providing they
were not subscribers of ours. What do we care
for the baker? And what do we care for his
girl ? What do our readers care ? If the girl
chooses to jilt the baker, and take up with the
dustman, will that affect the price of flour ? And
if it does, it will not hurt us. We live on iron
nails and ground bones of bush humourists. And
now let us ask any person whom the devil has
tempted to send us a story to resist the temptation;
and, instead of putting the story in the post-office,
to put it in the poor-box. Some unfortunate
creature, to whom life is a burden, may then get
it and be released. But if the story is really funny
—and it would be well to submit it to the monu-
mental mason to make sure of this—then send it
along. We would not like to crush genius in the
bud, because wo have known many geniuses who
would have made excellent plate-layers if they
had not been crushed prematurely. When any-
body of importance in the town—the Mayor’s cat,
for instance—dies, we shall always be glad to hear
of it. And, if our correspondent can assure us—
as he hopes to see Heaven—that he is giving us the
information with his latest breath we shall be all
the more pleased, and proud to drink to his
memory. Correspondence on this basis we are
always willing to accept—and on no other.

The things that were wonders to our
fathers—but this is too delicate a style for our
simple paper. We are nearly a hundred years
ahead of the last century. There is pace for you!
And what have we done during this time? Al-
most everything, from inventing telephones to
talk with the saints in glory to constructing patent
jimmies for opening poor-boxes. Professor Ander-
son—who is now showing somewhere in the colo-
nies—used to make us stare once. He could hardly
do that now—unless he asked us to lend him some-
thing. He has what he calls a new trick in his
repertoire. It consists of cutting his wife to
pieces on the stage, and then putting her together
again. This is poor fun. Go up a back lane in
Woolloomooloo any night, and you can see a
better show than that for nothing. You can see
wives cut to pieces—and not with a sword, but
with a simple boot or axe-handle—and left in
pieces as you imagine. But are they ? Well, you
will see them going out about an hour later to
pawn their petticoat to get beer for the performer.
Pshaw I Professor Anderson is out of date.

Another bard. Perdition is full of them.
This one opens up with a remonstrance addressed
to us about the manner in which we treated some-
thing or other immortal he sent us some time ago,
and which he says his mother considered very
clever. We would never have presumed to set
our opinion against that of a lady if he had re-
stricted the circulation of his poem to his mother.
And here we will drop a hint. When a young man
becomes Intoxicated with the praise of his private
friends, let him not seek further. This rule applies
as much to intoxication with fame as with whisky
—when drunk, stay at home. However, as this
youth as elected to do otherwise, wo will let him
speak. Says he:—
"You certainly gave me a critic—
A good one, people might think;
But was not your decision too quick
Appearing in BnxLETiN-covered pink ?”
Perhaps our decision was too quick ; we are hasty
sometimes If we recollect aright, we informed
him upon a previous occasion that he could not
make poetry, but with perseverance and attention
to details he might in course of time make very
good beer. And now, on second thoughts, wo
come to the conclusion that ho would not make
even good beer. Ho has not sufficient head. But
he is willing to acknowledge his deficiencies
“ I know I’m not an artist yet.
Have much to practice and learn :
On those verses I would like opinion to get,
Give, as you think, mild or stem.”
Now, this is magnanimous. We would like
to say something pleasant about his poor,
little rhymes. But what can we say? Only
this—we hope and trust that the gods love him,
and that the usual result will follow suddenly.
There seems to be a presentiment of this in the
lines that come after :—
“I may some day bo amongst the useful body
Of those happy ones writing in this clime.”
If he only knew how much they are wanted—dead!
Poets, politicians, patriots—the grave yawns for
them I But, to go on. Here is a sample of the sort
of thing we get by every mail from young men
who couslder we are doing them and the public an
injustice, and literature a lasting injury, by not
printing their “ poems
“ THE MOON AND THE TREE,
“ Clouds are slowly mooving (sic)
Yonder in the blue skies;
The bright moon’s shing (sic)
In dreary night with firy (sic) eyes.
“ Oh, through the trees serene,
While dark-green their hue,
As charmingly is seen
As human eye e’er knew.”
One hardly knows which to pity the more—the
poet or the moon. But it must be the moon; the
poet will cease and be at peace one of these days,
but the moon will never be at peace while she
hangs in heaven. As soon as one bard is done bay
ing at her, another, who is seven times worse, rises
up. Curious thing, isn’t it, that as soon as a youth
has learnt to write, and long before he has learnt
to spell, he must outrage the moon ? But there is
lurid strength in the line—
" In dreary night with fiery eyes.”
It suggests Dor(5 at his darkest; it suggests Baude-
laire in his most abysmal mood; it suggests—of
course—a tram-car- And now we are weary of
this young man. We hope a copy of this issue will
reach his residence in time to be put in the coffin
with him.

Jl correspondent signing himself “Kisser”
has sent us what he calls “ some very nice things
in verse.” We have sent them to the sewer. After
telling a prurient story about some local
they wind up with these elegant lines:—
“ there is a few more loafers here
who mooch round on the track.”
Bird-like this, isn’t it ? We suspect the writer has
before now worn feathers—and tar. He writes
his doggerel in a forged hand—probably not the
first forging he has done. There was no need of
this; the subject was quite worthy of him. We
would not notice this young man—he must be a
young man, for no civilised community could ever
have allowed him to live to grow old—only that he
is a type of a large class who seem to think we
are publishing a paper for the benefit of the
damned. If “ Kisser,” as he signs himself—though
we daresay no respectable cow would be seen kiss-
ing him—is to be judged by his writing, then we can
unhesitatingly affirm that he will do credit to any
gallows.

His hat was minus a band and part of
the rim, while through the crown blew the sweet
airs of heaven, so badly was it torn. His nose re-
sembled in hue the trunk of a boiled lobster, and
his clothes had become wrinkled from smoothing
down the grass in the park. His toes were better
—that is, they were able to be out; and so were
his elbows. About his breath there was an odour
that reminded one of the offence of Hamlet’s
uncle—it was rank, and smelt to heaven. As
he entered the door of the sixpenny restaurant,
and with light steps stealthily approached the
waiter, that individual looked up with a well-
defined interrogation-point in each eye. “ Please
sir,” said the impecunious one, as he stood twirl-
ng his dilapidated head-gear in his hands, " how
ong can a man do without eating ?” “Aderned
sight longer than some of ’em can without drink-
ing,” was the somewhat sarcastic reply; “for in-
stance, there was Dr. Tanner, over in America—
he went forty days without eating, and got fat
on it. Now, I’ve seen men that if they would only
do without drink that long, and wash themselves
up and go to work, would look quite respectable."
"Shol You don’t mean me, do you? I’m not a
drinking man. But say, can’t you give us a feed ?
I’m dreadful hungry*” “No, sir; unless you’ve
got the necessary sixpence. Why, in the name of
decency, don’t you go and wash yourself ? You’re
as dirty as a pig.” “Do you see that dark line
around my neck near the shirt-band ? You do.
Well, that’s the high-water mark I got by diving
into swill-barrels after something to eat. Let me
go out the back way, won’t you? I wan’t to
lick the sweat off the kitchen windows. I'm
awful hungry.” Just at this juncture, the pro-
prietor came up, and the next thing that vaga-
bond knew, the footpath rose up and met his nose,
and nearly put it out of joint. As he gathered
himself up and walked away he muttered thought-
fully: “ Strange world this—very strange. If you
ask a man fora drink, he gives you a coldshoulder;
if you ask him for a, loaf, he gives you a flsht t
Strange world—very strange.”

Here is enterprise—here is business acumen
—here is a lesson for our sleepy speculators I Head
this advertisement, written by a poor Queensland
innkeeper, and hire a man to blush for you! He


ts speaking—the innkeeper is—of the advantages
accruing to people who stop at his hotel. Says he:
“ SPLENDID SPORT—Alligator Shooting.
® Sportsmen are reminded that it takes a
first-class Rifle to bring down this splendid
GAME (a miss in many cases proves fatal to
the Sportsman). Rifles always on hire.”
Splendid game, certainly—for the alligators. We
presume the rifles that are on hire are first-class
fatalities. If we had a rich uncle who was fond of
sport we would send him up to that hotel at once—
and go halves in the result with the landlord.
But this is not all the fun to be had. Read again:
“ A shot at a Nigger can always be relied on,
a large Camp (Myalls) being only two miles
from the Hotel.”
There is a man for you! There is perception of
public taste I But you say it Is outrageous satire 7
go it is;—but there has been a great mortality
among the blacks up there, lately. Wish we had a
drink 1 We wonder which the landlord hires lout
to sportsmen to kill the niggers with—his rifles, or
his rum 7
You have all heard of a certain marvellous
oil which can euro anything I Well, it is marvel-
lous, but we never knew how much so, till we read
a testimony in a Northern paper the other day. It
Is in the form of a letter from the father of a
formerly dumb girl up there. This girl, it seems,
went to bed one night in her usual good health,
but the next morning she was as dumb as a door-
mat. Her mother took her to the doctor, “ who
advised her to inhale the fumes of Stockholm tar,
saying she might never recover her speech again.”
From the construction of this sentence, we infer
that the fumes of Stockholm tar are particularly
comforting to persons with a leaning towards
silence. What a pretty present a little cake of it—
with a small work of art, such as you get on the
flat boxes of wax-matches, stuck on one side—
would make for the member of Windsor. This is
only a delicate hint—[Oh, go on I— Ed. B.]. But the
tar-fumes were not properly inhaled, or some-
thing. Anyhow, the girl still remained mute.
The doctors prescribed several other remedies
such as mentally repeating the Thirty-nine
Articles backwards three minutes before moon-
rise every night, covering the ears with
paste made of fern-seed and iron filings, and
swallowing cobblestone soup. Still the girl did not
recover. This was a matter of surprise to the
whole faculty of that township. The faculty, we
might remark, in passing, consisted of a really
good doctor, who could quote you Instances from
Galen and Averroes, from the rising of the sun to
the going down thereof, and a superannuated
sawyer, who got a sudden and miraculous insight
into the science of medicine while falling from the
top of a turpentine tree. We don’t know which
treated the case, but we suspect it was the sawyer.
Anyhow, the girl was getting on famously with
the dumb alphabet, when one night her father
took it into his head to rub her neck with the oi 1
we mentioned. He only used two drops of it in
water. What was the result? Why, next
morning she was blaspheming all round the
house, to the Intense delight of everybody.
Curiously enough, this is true. So also is
this perhaps. As the undertaker’s men were
screwing down the lid of a coffin in a house In
Surry Hills a few days ago, one of them, who had
in his pocket a bottle of the oil in question, which
he was taking home to give to hij grandfather
who was dead, happened to spill four-fifths of a
drop on the corpse. Nothing came of this then,
but late that night, when the neighbours were in
the house of mourning, drinking a pleasant journey
to the deceased, a dreadful knocking at the door
was heard. Somebody got up and opened
it, and, gentlemen all, as we hope to wear a crown
of glory where the moth does not rust, there was
the corpse with his coffin on his back like a tor-
toise carrying his shell. The oil had not taken
effect until after they had buried him. This oil
we may also state, is a certain cure for horses with
a tendency to homicide. Two drops of it put on
their oats will take the kicking out of them for
ever. This is the very oil that Apollonius of
Tyana used whenever he wanted to be in two or
more places at once. He made it out of toads’-
blood, and the brains of suicides. The secret was
lost, like a great many other secrets during the
Dark Ages, and was not re-discovered until com-
paratively lately, when an American genius came
upon it quite casually, while looking for a stray
cow—though there are some who say that he re-
ceived it by a special revelation. The calcined
bones of members of Congress and other criminals
are now used in its manufacture, Instead of the
materials employed by Apollonius. However,
nobody need die now, who prefers to live.

You will receive this information with a
titter of delight. We got it in an English paper.
The Duchess of Fdinburgh has been entertaining
quite a number of visitors lately. Titter here!
There were the Duke of Albany, several earls, and
a waggon-load of right honorables. They went
out shooting, and the paper from which we quote
says:—“The Duke of Albany was not very for-
tunate with his gun”—poor, dear invalid! we
should Imagine he was very fortunate in being
allowed to carry a gun at alii—“but Lord Hoth-
fleld and Captain Billington seemed rarely to fail
in their aim, and the skill of Captain Wynne Finch
was marvellous.” Judging by his name wo should
fancy the latter gentleman would be equally lucky
with the bonea or the billiard-cue. Funny how
suggestive names are sometimes. We know a man
once [What has that got to do with the matter 7
Confine youtself to fact.— Ed. B.]—who is now
dead. He was an editor—and he died suddenly
from carrying too far one day a habit of interrup-
tion he had acquired during a long and infamous
career. But it seems this Captain Wynne Finch is
one of those men born occasionally for the purpose
of setting the table in a roar, though why or how the
table should roar is more than wo ever understood-
“ However,” says our authority, speaking of the
madcap captain, “he amused the ladies by taking
off his coat and firing in his shirt-sleeves, the tem-
perature being warm.” There was a wild waa- for
you—there was a merry fellow, if you like! He
saw the affair was dull, the gay dog, and, as he had
nothing to say that would brighten it, what
does he up and do but take off his coat. If he
had kept his coat on there would have been no
amusement. This quickness of insight and ready
humour marks him out as a man especially fitted
to fill a coffin with pleasure to all. There is a
spectral sparkle about his humorous Impromptu
which faintly forefliokers what a demon of drollery
he will bo when ho becomes a corpse. This little
incident shows us how little we should begrudge
the members of our Royal Family their amuse-
ments. If we knew where to dig for a copy of
Sydney Punch we would send it to them. After
this, we have no doubt it would convulse them
with merriment. This is what is called “whole"
some fun,” you know.

We forget now where Wide Bay is, but
what does that matter 7 What docs anything
matter? We will bet you a keg of rum that we
can to you that it is of no consequence to
you whether you were born dead or not. But,
never mind. There is a newspaper in Wide Bay
and will be long before you were born. And it is
proud of being there, too, is that paper—or the
editor of that paper: though whether the editor
edits the paper or the paper papers the editor, wo
have neither idea nor information, and don’t want
to have. What interests us in the matter is that
the editor gives an anecdote in a late issue of an
old sailor—“ ancient mariner,” he calls him, be-
cause that sort of thlr g is considered graphic writ-
ing up, or down, there—whom he heard lamenting
in the street about having lost time in the various
seaports of the world. But lot the editor tell it:—
“Yes, I’ve lost my time,” he repeated; “I’ve
lived in every seaport in England — Liverpool,
Bristol, Plymouth, all of them; and I thought I
knew what foul language was. But,” and here he
looked up, “ I learned more her a in five minutes
on Wednesday than in the whole of my life. I’ve
lost iry time.” We should think so. There is
more to curse about in Wide Bay in five minutes
than in the remainder of the earth in a long and
blasphemous existence. We have not been there,
but we have seen the paper. There is the paper
to curse, and the editor's father, and grandfather.
And a pretty poor kind of a place it must be that
can only lay claim to celebrity for its cursing
We wouldn’t send an alderman there, and we
would send him to almost any place where we
didn’t expect to go ourselves.

Mr. Blue-Ribbon Glover urges the un-

Edward Hanlan says that he saw King
Kalakua when he stopped at the Sandwich Islands

nothing, Edward. We know a man who “saw”

like 400 dollars.
As 1-iSA is divisible by 4 without a re-

An exchange says that several impudent
robberies have been committed in and around
Brisbane lately. We have heard of highway i ob-

Monsignor Lynch left £500 for a requiem

Here is a nice little item about the great
Calcutta Exhibition, for which the London Tele-
graph is responsible:—“ A large portion of the
material out of which the Calcutta Exhibition has
been erected was carried on the backs of women,
some of whom were nursing children at the time.”
After all. there are a few bright spots in this re-
ligious and civilised nineteenth century,
A Melbourne “society” paper (humph!)
commences a puerile yarn thusly:-“ In this, the
latter end of the Eighteenth Century , and espec ially
In this country of compulsory education and cheap
newspaper literature” This particular specimen
of “cheap newspaper literature” doesn't speak
well for the “ compulsory education.” does it ?
The Eighteenth Century—good gracious!

The Poet, with his passion-frenzied eye,
The Prophet with his prophecies of woe—

And make a pot of many a mighty brain-pan.
On opening the will of an Essex millionaire
a few months ago it was found he had bequeathed
to his daughters their weight in £1 bank notes.
The eldest daughter scooped £51,300, but the
younger pulled the scale at £57,344. If their hus-
bands had kno wn the terms of the will before the
old man stepped out they’d have stall-fed the girls
until the Bank of England couldn’t hoist them on
the scales.
Up North, a boy undertook to pour a
charge of powder down the barrel of a gun that
had been worked into a led heat by constant
tiring. Strange to say, the boy and the gun went
otf together, although they had only been a few
hours acquainted with each other. This is how the
Narrabri Argus tells the tale ;—“Tragedy in two
acts :—Act I.: Boy—Gun. Joy—Fun, Act II.:
Gun—Bust. Boy—Dust. (Curtain.)”
At Bourke a man recently purchased an-
other man’s wife and three children for £2. And
yet young, blushing, and innocent creatures talk
of being obliged to go to New Caledonia! Now,
we know that if a passible-looking girl can get up
Cobar way, she is certain of dropping in for a good
thing. And then what a comfort to consider that
even when pasnie and hampered by three kids, she
will yet fetch the noble sum of £2. This is a great
country.
“ The law for you as for your victim has
the most profound compassion,” said the Chief
Justice. He then sentenced the prisoner to be
hanged. The Inquisition, too, had a profound
sympathy with heretics — would not shed their
blood, so gave them oyer to the civil power to be
burnt. What we want to know is this: If the law
has compassion on the wretch whose life It is going
take, what punishment does it mete out to him
or whom it has no compassion at all ?
Wontagoona Mathews, the King of Louth,
is oq the warpath down here once again—and this
reminds ua. One flood season, the mails for
Wontagoona were delayed for fully three weeks,
and a travelling “drummer” asked if a blank
period like that wasn’t considered somewhat dull.
'■ Well, yes,” replied the Louth magnate; ‘but,
then, they’re just as badly off in Sydney for they
never hear what we’re doing at Wontagoona.” As
It looked like rain, the drummer left abruptly.
Princess Charlotte was, perhaps, the cham-
pion tomboy and hoyden of her day in England.
A rather good story is told of her with regard to
one of tier scapegrace uncles. It seems that, after
the manner of certain living Princes, he had intro-
duced a frail fair weakness into the sacred Court
ring. On the Queen’s expressing her horror at the
ao-ion, Charlotte coolly observed, “ What does it
matter ? The Dukes can’t marry whom they like,
and they must love somebody, you know!”—are-
mark, we may add, which embodies a good deal of
sound philosophy.

The cry is still they come. Melbourne
papers declare ‘ a rumour is current about town
that society will shortly be shocked by the dis-
closures in an application to the Divorce Court on
the part of a gentleman prominent in fashionable
circles, who will make a very popular Melbourne
clergyman the co-respondent. Popular clergy-
men will be up to their larks, It seems, and this
leads to a very strange consideration. How is it
that none but married clergymen ever get into
similar scrapes ? Catholic priests never carry on
like this—at least, if they do, we never hear of it

We notice that poor Clifford, the actor,
rscently committed suicide in Hobart. He bor-
rowed sixpence off a shoemaker, bought six-
pennyworth of opium, and soared. Clifford was a
good-natured fellow, and a fair actor, and he like-
wise.wrote some “are more,” dramas, which, like
Horne Tooke’s, “ adapted for the closet than the
stage.” Clifford had a glass of brandy-and-cloves
before going to bed on the fatal night, and we are
disposed to t hink that had as much to do with kill-
ing him as the six-pennyworth of opium. If that
amount of opium could kill a man, the writer of
this pan. would have been fencing in his allotment
on the golden shoah long ere this.
Sirenree has been interviewed by a Pall
Mali. Gazette reporter, and says:—“ Tf ynuoould
put a ring-fence round New Guinea, it might re-
mainlasitjsbutyou cannot. The only wayln which
the mischief can he prevented is by converting
the island into a Crown colony ; that, no doubt,
would accelerate the settlement and development
of the resources of New Guinea, but it would en-
sure that the inevitable impact of the white on
the dark-skinned races should take place with a
minimum of cruelty and injustice.” This is all
very well, of course. But a party cooking beef
blocks in a frying-pan without a handle up the
line wants to know where she is in all this.
At tho annual conversazione of the Exeter
Literary Society, held on Saturday evening, Janu-
ary 13, Sir Stafford Northcote delivered an address
on “Nothing.” On receipt of this intelligence, a
special meeting of the directors of tho Hunter-
street Zero was held. The question now is, how
to put it to Sir Stafford about throwing over the
leadership of the Conservative party and coming
down here, where there is more scope. Another
meeting is to be held—the managers dividing on a
man who limits himself to Nothing. The tradi-
tions of the paper and the more influential men
lean to a large subsidy if Sir Staffed will consent
to modify his views, and come and write some-
thing less.
On the occasion, some time ago, of a
political veteran's visit to Boggabri, in the neigh-
bourhood of which smiling home of burr and
black soil a portion of his earlier days had been
passed, he caught sight of an aged nig. whose pod
was well-nigh as snowy as bis own, and, recog-
nising an old acquaintance, exclaimed with his
usual bluff cordiality to everyone: “Hello, Billy!
I s’pose you’ve forgotten me by this time, eh?”
The countless wrinkles on the old darkey s f ice
puckered up till It looked like a minaturo Black
Sea in a gale of wind, and a sly twinkle came into
bis eyes as he replied: “No fear, Misser
It———; I ’member you. I ’member well ’nough
time you run 'way with my gin. My word I” Then
that wicked old legislator, Instead of being covered
with confusion at the dark mine so unexpectedly
sprung upon him, burst into a roar of laughter, '
while the fair aristocrats of the surrounding plains
sniggered consumedly.
Very smart fellows, some of those New
Zealanders I A young man in Christchurch has
been giving private entertainments of rope-tying
tricks. He gets into a box, lets his friends cord it,
and gets out again in two or three minutes wlth-
outassisiance. This is clover enough and harmless
enough, if the young man does not become too
haughty about it. If he does, we will back Mr.
Robert Howard, of this city—who has a pretty
little knot of his own Invention—to fix a rope on
him that he will not unfasten, unless he can un-
fasten his head also. But, may be, he can do that.
Young men who devote their energies to rope-
tying tricks are of about the same Intellectual
value without a head as with one.
Young men, on matrimonial joys intent,
would do well to take warning from the case of
John Light, a venerable Melbourne citizen. John,
it seems, doesn’t live on the best of terms with her
who is—actually, as well as figuratively—his “ old
woman,” and, after one of their periodical conju-
gal storms, ho retired to his room and took trem-
bling aim at himself with a pistol. Mr. Light,
however, didn’t altogether extinguish his light,
but merely succeeded in inflicting a “ small wound
on the top of his head,” and, his worthy spouse
disturbing him in this single-handed combat, he
“ left the house.” Half an hour later, being then
in a calm and penitent mood, John returned, and
his “old woman” “gave him into custody for
attempting to commit suicide.”
Somewhere about the centre of our
Northern district there resides a fussy little
medico—suppose we call him Hawkins—who pulls
the scale at about 1st., and whose very much better
half is a portly Milesian matron, whose style of
architecture might be termed colossal, and whose
knowledge of the three R.’s is, to say the least, of
an extremely limited nature. A few nights ago
there was a social little “ sing song ” party at the
doctor’s house, and as the company were grouped
around, the local banker asked; “ What’s up with
Thompson, doctor ? Hemever sings at all now ’ ”
‘No,” replied the pill-roller, “and I fear he never
will again. Fact is, he’s suffering very much, just
now, from a swollen uvula.” “Hawkins,”
screamed the unfortunate doctor’s lady, “ you
forget sir, there is ladies present.” And then she
sailed out of the room like a Dutch man-o’-war,
while the company jobbed pins in themselves to
ease off the merriment.
“Out of evil cometh good’’—occasionally.
Scene : Department of Public Muddje—Superin-
tendent’s sanctum. Enter First Official: “Bad case

Superintendent, excitedly: “D n those fellows!
there’s always something. Look here: Flashman’s
people are well off—tell him to get them to square
it up at once, or he’ll be arrested. Bully him like
h II, but keep the thing dark. It mustn’t get
into those infernal ne'wspapers, or they’ll say we
carry on here just as loosely as they do in the
G.P.O. How’s that affair of Skinner's?” “Oh,
the old man paid half the cash down, and we’ll
stop Skinner’s salary for the balance.” 8.: “Right;
and then, when you get clear, find some way of
sacking him at the earliest opportunity, D n
these fellows 1 they’re enough to ruin one’s diges-
tion.” Skinner’s trouble was squared, and now
he's inspecting public buildings.
Anecdote illustrative of the generosity of
Prince Bismarck: On the evening of Gravelotte
there was nothing to eat-nobody could get any-
thing. Then the masterly statesmanship of the
Prince was exhibited. H» procured live eggs.
Did he eat all these himself ? No; he ate two and
divided the other three with two of his com-
panions—that is, taking one himself. He thought
the two eggs he gave away were bad. This almost
equals in magnaminity the famous action of Sir
Philip Sydney at the battle of Zutphen, when he
told the man who was bringing him water to give
it to a dying soldier, who had more need of it than
he. Ho took it for Hollands at first, and was so
disgusted when he found out it wasn’t, that he
made a noble speech, which has charmed every
generation since and immediately turne 1 over
and died. Let these instances of lofty heroism
teach us to take our rum separate from the gruel
whenever we get our periodical cold.
The English press speaks with as much
confidence upon Australian matters as the Pro-
testant Standard when it is giving the statistics
of Hell. For instance, the London Daily Tele-
graph “expects to witness iu a few months the
birth of a new nation in the Southern seas.” What
nation ? All this information comes from the
missionaries who have gone home with fat purses
and a noble gout to talk about the “pore heathen ”
in Exeter Hall. The only nation they hav» founded
out here is damnati m -for which the devil may
thank them, but we cannot. And yet, why not ?
If they had not established Hell on a firm founda-
tion moat of our politicians and men of note
would be as good as homeless when they got into
the next world, and even we ourselves might have
peen taken up for vagrancy when we reached
there. So let us be grateful to the missionaries,
aad we have a crooked threepence let
us put it in their plate.

M’Elhone’s 30-ribbed, time-payment ging-

(esthetic K.B. condescended to hold over the roval
cocoasuts of Ned and Georgie. It was with this

Browne in imminent danger of his life by pointing
ttat him, and threatening to blow his brains out
with its contents—although by the way, it after-
wards transpired the weapon was only loaded with
a few sheep’s trotters the senator was carrying
home for supper. That he values it even as the
jealous Moor did his fond wife’s mouchoir is evi-
dent £ om tbe fact that having at one of the re-
cent East Sydney election meetings observed a
prominent ‘ Dimercrat ” eyeing his treasure sus-
piciously, Mac. walked up and flourishing a fist
like a prize ham in his face yelled out : “ You
handle that umbrella, you touch that umbrella,
you even look at that umbrella, and I’ll cram it
down your gory throat and then spread it.”
The details, as given by the Parramatta
Fkrgt and by Salvation Cyrus, are widely
different — sometimes contradictory — but there
appears to be no doubt about tiie bar® facts of the
case. These are they. A male soldier in the Par-
ramatta detachment of the “Army” fell in love
with a female warrier In the commissariat branch
of the force. “Charley the German” was the
knight's name—Stettler, the patronymic under
which Imogene sidled along towards Zion. They
were married by the Rev. w. J, Gunther, and at
the feast two extra lege had to be put under the
table to support the obelisks of corned beef,
carrots, and sour-kraut prepared for the occasion.
With the discernment or an “ old soldier,’’ Charley
appears to have gauged his comrades’ appetites.
By the time the revellers had parted with most of
their buttons a dance was proposed, and the floor
was cleared. This was too much for the bride.
Charley had entrusted her with £40, and among
the guests was an old flame of hers in the sinful
days, before salvation reached as far as Parramatta.
The dance was over, the guests departing, but the
bride—where, where was she? Ask of the winds
that far—Let us be calm. She, the ci-devant sweet-
heart and the £40 had gone over the water and left
Charlie. It is upon these simple facts that the
journals mentioned have built their irreconcilable
and improbable stories.
Quite recently the Ashfleld Nimrod Club
enthusiasts chartered a 4000-ton steamer, and
cleared the Heads for a real good day’s Ashing.
And they enjoyed themselves immensely. So did
the flsh, who were hreawfull of fun as soon as they
caught sight of the Nimrod mullets perched on the
rails endeavouring to cud the finny schools into
taking a schnapp-er two at the trussed prawns that
dangled seawards. Just after lunch, however, the
waves began to get a trifle giddy and the Ashfleld
Waltons amused themselves by leaning over the
side and pelting the flsh with Scotch pies, bits of
liver, and everything else that was handy, at the
same time joining in a soul - stirring nautical
chorus, the burden of which was “Whooo-ooopI
Ooop-lal” Luckily lor the crowd, however, the
steamer was well able to carry all the plunder
home without submerging her Plimsoll chalk line.
And as they trudged along together with empty
creels, says the Mayor to Alderman Scott, says he-
" By thunder, we had a real gay old time ot it to-
day ! now, didn’t we ?” Then says Alderman Scott
to the Mayor, soys he: “Gel-oriousl stupendously
gei-orious! I shan't forget that nibble I had just
before dinner, even If I live for athousand years.”
But the verdict of the Nimrod's wives was that it
would have been a considerable saving in the way
of time and trouble if the bold lishermen had
stayed at home and cooked their bait.
A little while ago the Qundagai Bailey
was going to treat its contemporary, the Local
and Ancient Ilworthy with all “possible
journalistic courtesy.’’ It seems that the School
of Arts won’t give him an ad„ and, so under the
heading of “Coercion ” he writes as follows-—
“The public would do well to pause and consider
whether they should support an affair which
is characterised by such gross favouritism as
is here displayed . . ., The Literary Institute,
as in most other institutions, is composed
of the proprietor of the Gundagai Times, his
editor, his overseer and fellow lickspittlers.”
Ideas may, of course, differ on the subject of
journalistic courtesy, but we certainly can’t see
anything very affectionate about this. We re-
member this kim4 of courtesy being extended to
people up Queensland way many years ago, and
the miners expressing their sense of it by making
a mud dumpling of the editor. They tried to
draw his eye-teeth, too, with a pair of boarding-
house tongs, and evinced a disposition to shake his
left whisker with a chopper. Curiously enough,
we were offered the editorship ot that paper just
about that time, the editor having to go South on
“urgent private affairs.” The miners, too, were
flattering in their efforts to secure our brilliant
services, and at a crowded meeting we consented
to act. We addressed the assembly In a neat
speech from the dining-room table of the Eldo-
rado Hotel, only being interrupted three times by
combats, and twice by gentlemen “ heaving ” the
lamp at people with whose political views they
could not agree. We said we were proud of the
confidence reposed in us, and directly the meeting
had fought Itself out into the rainy night, we
girded up the butcher's horse and fled for our lives.
Nyngan has a new progress committee
now, and those dead bullocks are beginning to
show signs of life once more. What dead bullocks ?
Ah ! thereby hangs a tale. Some six months ago
the Government dammed the river above Nyngan
and for about a month after, the inhabitants
revelled in the oriental luxury of a wash once a
day in real water, and a couple of Holy Joeys were
on the eve of starting a Temperance Lodge, when
suddenly a “ fresh ” set in ; the dam burst, and in
a few hours a score of dead bullocks were wafted
down and safely anchored almost in the very
township. Then the people began to damn the
river themselves—for the dry season set in, and
pretty soon the defunct cattle began to make
things go so high that many of the Nynganeese
couldn’t afford to stay about the district. The
old progress committee then held a meet-
ing, and passed a series of resolutions, the
only result being an increased activity on the part
of the aforesaid bullocks. More meetings were
held, and one committeeman ev«n went so far as
to suggest that fortnightly meetings be in future
held twice a week, but the cattle still kept on in
the even but bad-smelling tenor of their way. At
last the police were applied to, but, as no warrants
had been issued, and there were no funds avail-
able, the “foorce” was powerless also, the only
hope held out being a promise made by the
oflloer in charge that if the committee “showed
him the man that put them dead bullicks In the
river, he’d run him in immaejitely—if notsooner.”
The cattle, however, are still masters of the situa-
tion, and the subject for debate at the next Pro-
gress Committee is, “ Whether would it be more
advisable to shift the bullocks, or to shift Nyngan?”
It is thought the latter would be by far the cheap-
est, and most efficacious plan.”
“THE BRITISH SOLDIER IS TO BE SUPPLIED WITH SLIPPERS.”—English item.
This is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough. We hope to live
to see the day when that bulwark of our liberties, the British Soldier, will face the
cannon’s mouth, nor only in easy fitting slippers, but a smoking cap of tasteful design,
and a “Jonah’s gourd” dressing-gown. And now a thought strikes us, just as we go to
press—a sweetly dreamy thought. This slipper policy will give scope to the mis-direoted
energies of that charming young person whom he, the British Soldier, left behind him.
A pair of these regulation slippers (easily obtained, doubtless, on application to Mr.
Gladstone or the Minister for War), embroidered by her own fair hands, with designs in
which the symbols of love and war are curiously blended, would be a fitting reminder
of her love.


If the starving London poor ever read the
twaddle drafted from home to our daily contem-
poraries, how they must squirm in their rags and
misery. Here is a sweet little refrain from
Granny’s blue-blooded correspondent. Speaking
of the Marquis of Hertford, lately deceased, he
pathetically wails, “But the late peer had to
maintain the family dignity upon something like
£30,000 a year.” Poor fellow.

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS
Spurgeon entertains some strong opinions
with regard to the Salvation Army. Being him-
self nothing if not sensational, he naturally has an
Intense horror of extreme sensationalism in others
—since one never excuses in others tho'e faults by
which one is affected oneself : though to do
Spurgeon justice his sensationalism has ever < een
confined to his own tabernacles and publications,
whereas that of the Army is aggressively objec-
tionable in every public place. Says Spurgeon to
the Salvationists “ The other day I read in your
official report, ‘Braes band better than ever, 13
blowing salvation through their instruments.’ If
tnis be so, let them blow till ail is blue ; it is not
for us to rail at sounding brass if it has indeed
become a channel of salvation. Blow by all means.
If any of you judge that this is your high calling,
pursue it ardently; and if outraged humanity
should pelt you with mud and rotten eggs, do not
reckon that a strange thing has happened unto you.
If you should also create about twice as much bias
phemy as religious feeling, do not be surprised ; if
your course of action shouid bring ridicule on all
religion, and educate the mob in the art of riotinir,
which they may use by-and-bye with unexpected
results, do not marvel. If you conceive this to be
your line of usefulness, listen to no advice; reckon
all who differ from you as your enemies; become
martyrs; and go forward as good soldiers, so long
as leather and brass hold out. Only be prepared
for contingencie >. Suppose the big drum and
tambourine should cease to charm, what next?
What else is to be done? Will you stand on your
heads? Hornpipes have been tried; will you try
the tight rope ? ” It is rather good though to read
Spurgeon’s denunciation of creating blasphemy
and bringing ridicule on orthodox views, when
one remembers that tis not much above a quarter
of a century ago since he was advertising himself
by talking about the Lamb of God being always
in season though green peas weren’t; and making
Surrey Music Hall audiences guffaw at similar
Oddities.
Thus Moderator Laing i—“ From time to
time we are startled by hideous exposures of vice
and crime, which disclose a frightful condition of
degradation and immorality in a certain class of
our population. I will not say that the Church of
Christ is blameless in this matter.” Bosh! The
Church of Christ cannot be otherwise than blame-
less, else it ceases to be the Church of Christ.
What Moderator Laing should have said was that
the Presbyterian Church is not blameless, and
ditto for the Catholic Church, and all the rest of
the plate-humping, salary-scrambling institutions
Father Mahogany has evidently taken a
leaf out of the book of zat goot ole mahn, Pastor
Chiniquy. One Sunday, a few weeks ago, it was
announced at the 11 o’clock Mass at St. Mary’s
Cathedral that a special lecture for men only
would be given in the afternoon, to which no
women or children would be admitted. About
3000 males rolled up, and no doubt were highly
delighted with all they heard. Taking it on the
whole, this innovation was a great success; but it
was mighty rough on the ladies at home, each of
whom must have felt like a citizen’s wife on the
night of her husband’s being made a
That’s where the “ Canajian ” divine had the bulge
on the Catholic clargy. He was a very much
married man himself, and consequently could
argue the case from both standpoints. Gentle-
men's lectures in the morning, and spiritual dis-
courses with ladies only in the evening. That vas
the roshy ieedle game dot Charley played. And it
took well, too.
The Baboo Keshub Chunder Sen, the
leader of the Brahmo Sornaj, died in January, aged
46. He was the successor of ammohuu Roy, who,
a few years prior to his decease in 1833, had founded
an institution to revive the ancient Monotheism of
India. The Brahmo Somaj was not established on
Its present footing till 1860. Sen was born in 1838,
and was educated at the Hindu College, Calcutta.
He joined the Brahmo Somaj in 1860, and, being a
born orator, Boon became its leader. In 18T0 he
visited England, He believed that ho was inspired.
His system of faith opposed caste, idolatry, asceti-
cism, metempsychosis, suttee, child - marriages
(though he allowed hie own daughter to be mar-
ried to a wealthy Hindu prince before she had
attained the age which he had fixed on as the least
that should be insisted on in the reform he
preached), and every form of deism ; find advo-
cated ethical monotheism, the duty of prayer and
self-surrender to God. and the eventual union (in
the Brahmo Somaj) of all the religious sects of tho
Christian and Mahommedan world.
The description of Christ alleged to have
been written by Publius Lentulus, President of
Judnea, to the Roman Senate, the original of which
precious (?) account is said to he preserved in the
Vatican library, is a clumsy fiction. The docu-
ment at the Vatican purporting to be Lentu'us's
description is obviously a third century fabrica-
tion : yet we are constantly seeing its contents
gravely published in papers and magazines as
though it were the most authentic record in the
world. The fellow who evolved it out of his
inner conscious n ess was tho Lew. Wallace of his
day and generation, and we’Vo no particular fault
to find with him. Taking tne words of the 45th
Psalm, “Thou art fairer than the children of men.’’
as a sort of authority for laying it on thick, the
monkish fabricator did lay it on thick and no
mistake. “ In structure (he wro e) he is tail and
of perfect form; his countenance and air, sweet
and reverent, such as the beholders may both love
and fear; his hair is of a colour that would be
difficult to describe—something resembling the
colour of the ripe chestnut—from the crown of his
head to his ears, whence downward it is more of
a tint of golden hue, and falls waving and curling
into ringlets, and spreads Itself in golden profusion
on his shoulders. In the centre, from the fore-
head to the crown of his head, his hair is parted by
a seam or partition, and falls over each ear after
the manner of the Nazarenes. His forehead is
loftv and pale, and his face without spot or wrinkle,
bsautiflt d with a slight tinge of comely complexion.
His nose and mouth are formed with the most ad-
mirable “ymmetry. His beard is thick, and of the
colour of h s hair; not of any great length, and
dividing in the centre at the chin, takes nearly the
form of a fork. His look Innocent -ud mature.
His eyes blue, brilliant, and serenely beautiful. In
reproving, he is awful and majestic; in admonish-
ing, courteous, sweet, friendly, «ud persuasive;
and speaking or acting he is grave, temperate*
modest, and wise. It cannot be remembered that
any have ever seen him laugh, but niany have
seen him weep. In a word, he is a man who, by
h’s exc°6ding great beauty and his divine perfec-
tions, surpasseth the children of men.” As we
said above, thdre isn’t the least doubt that the
“Lentulus ” description is a third century fabrica-
tion. The bastard Latin of it is quite proof
enough that a Roman gentleman of the Augustan
age never wrote it. In all probability it was con-
cocted to combat the early Christian (and perhaos
accurate) notion that Christ was a man of mean
aspect, “ of no form nor comeliness.” In the
eighth century Joannes Damascenus issued another
k’root (though differing) description of the Christ,
word-painting him as “ stately,” with his eyebrows
joined together,” with “black hair” and of a
“ yellow complexion.” As a rule, Christ’s face in
portraits has almo«t invariably been the character-
istic free of the nation of the painter.

O’Shea and Jackson, two 9st. men, fought
a glove contest in Melbourne, on 15th March, for a

heavy fighting.
The Cootamundra-Wagga match for the
Cox Cup, played at Cootamundra, was won by
Wagga with an innings to spare.; T. Tompson, of
the Waggas, scored 49.
The Bourke Sheffield Handicap, to be run
on 30th and 31st May, 120 yards, open to all comers,
is for no less a sum than £3C0: first man £200, second
£50, third £30, and fourth £20,
Victor and Thomas are again matched to
wrestle the best of three falls—one la the Grreco-
Roman and two in catch-as-catch-can above the
waist—for £40. Thomas defeated Victor in the
last match.
From Wellington, N.Z , comes the news
that a proposal is on foot to send Hearn to Sydney
to try conclusions with Laycock and Hanlan. We
are afraid he would not “ earn ” his salt at the
game over here.
In Melbourne it has been resolved to form,
from the various suburban football clubs playing
the game of the Anglo-Australian Football Asso-
ciation, a team to play in the intercolonial match
at Sydney in July.
The Albert-War wick match was continued
on the Association Ground on Saturday last, when
the Albert innings came to a conclusion for the
large total of 395 runs. H. Moses (not out) 161, G.
Murdoch 43, G. Tooker 63, J. Cleeve 12.
Windsor v. Sind Carltons, on the Domain,
Saturday last. Windsors scored 145 in first innings
(Hannlgan 33, Defries 21, Greenwood 20, Spilsbury
15, not out), and Carltons lost 7 wickets tor 44 runs,
Graney topping the list with 13 not out.
Go it, ye cripples! W. C. Wood (very ap-
propriate name, that), the wooden-legged cham-
pion of Cootamundra, would like to make a match
for £50 a side with any other timber-toed pedes-
trian who fancies he caa walk ten miles in quicker
time than W. C. can.
The latest American skating sensation
comes from Fishkill, where Robert Henry skated
from Fishkill Landing to Albany, a distance of 101
miles, in lOhrs, 30min. He is said to have returned
the next day. John Ennis covered 100 miles in
llhrs. 37min. 45sec. at Chicago in 1879.
At the Adelaide races on St. Patrick’s Day ’
held on the old course, Memphy won the All-Aged
Handicap, Jem Mace the Steeplechase, and Brigand
| the St. Patrick’s Handicap. On the last race, the
totalisator was a trifle mixed, which brought out
curses loud and strong |rom the public.
On Thursday last an eleven from H.M.S.
Nelson played the Gladesvilie Hospital team, on
the grounds of the latter. Time would not allow
of the match being played out. The following
were the scores: Hospital, first Innings, 107, Nel-
son, first, 38; second, four wickets for 59.
On Jan. 22, at Shakespeare Hall, Syracuse,
New York, W. H. Craft accomplished the feat of
walking 300 miles without sleep or rest in 100 con-
secutive hours. Craft is the pedestrian who, in
1877, walked 806 miles, or at least was credited with
the feat, in 11 days, at Schenactady (N.Y.)
Professor Miller has challenged Donald
Dlnnie to wrestle best two out of three, or three in
five falls, Grmco-Roman style, for from £100 t©
£500. Dinnie has been a great athlete in his day,
but he must be gotiing rather too stale to tackle a
man like Miller with any chance ot success.
The American horse-owners, the Dwyer
Brothers, won £27,556 during the year 1883. This
sum is larger than any English owner of race-
horses has won in the past live years. In 1879 the
deceased Count Lagrange won £25,595, and this is
the nearest approach to the Dwyer’s winnings.
The Balmain Rowing Club, which, by the
way, recently gave its ’orny ’anded members the
go-by, on Saturday last held its second annual
regatta. J. Barnes won the 9st. skiff race; S. J.
Law the lOst. ditto ; J. Beadraan the over list,
ditto; and J. Langley the under 7st. ditto ;
T. R. Ainsworth, J. Fraser, P. Small, and
W. R. Ainsworth carried off the maiden gig
trophy; W. R. Ainsworth made an easy win of the
wager-boat race; and A. Kinnamount and J.
Fraser won the maiden double sculls.
Says the ’Frisco Newsletter: “Miller,
the Australian, la rivalling Sullivan. He is travell-
ing with a ‘combination,’ and will soon start for
this country to meet the slogger. Tf both com-
binations would meet in Honolulu and annihilate
each other, the world would be well rid of much
rubbish.”
Our own Edwards has duly arrived in
’Frisco. A local says: “ Edwards, the pedestrian
who defeated O’Leary with ease in Sydney and
Melbourne, reached this city on Tuesday. He has
come to a poor place to hunt up a walking-match.
We advise him to take a ticket for New York by
the first train.”
Canowindra races, Friday last. Albury
won the Maiden Plate; Elastic carried off the
Canowindra Handicap, Freedom 2nd, Barney 3rd;
Kilvardo won the Selling Race; Redmond the
Flying Handicap; the Balabula Handicap was
appropriated by Freedom; and Barney annexed
the Forced Handicap.
So far, the Croydon-Osborne match, for
the Junior Cup. stands—Croydona, first innings,
141 (M’Carthy 57) ; Osbornes, first innings, 97 ;
second, one wicket down for 6 runs. The contest
will bo continued next Saturday. The following
match is fixed for the 5th April, between the Car-
thonas and Orientals.
There is a probability of the Hon. W. B.
Hawke accompanying the professional team of
English cricketers who aro preparing to visit us
next season. Should the Hon. W. B. come he will,
no doubt, be skipper, and a great acquisition to the
batting strength of the team. His average for
Yorkshire last season was 16-9.
D. A. Driscoll defeated G. H. Hosmer, the
sculler, in their ten-mile walking match at Lynn,
Mass., Jan. 16. Hosmer went off with the load, but
gave up after walking 8}4 miles. Driscoll went on
until he had a score of 10 miles 333 feet 6 inches in
the announced time of Ibr. 16min. 39sec. It is
stated the timing was unreliable.
j When Williamson lest the big race on
Morpeth at the last Randwick meet, he received
his walking ticket next day. And yet the chest-
nut made a far better show than Martini did for
the recent Champion. Luckily for Hales, how-
ever, he bolds a twelve months’ engagement. The
fact is, the smartest pig skin straddler in the
world cannot take it out of a horse if it’s not in
him.
The quarter-mile heat of the swimming
contest, for the championship of Australia and a
stake of £100, took place on Saturday, at the St.
Kilda (Vic.) ship baths, between W. M’Indoa and
A. T. Kenny, and resulted in a win for Kenny, who
covered the course in 6mln. 38bssec. Next Satur-
day the distance will be half a mile, and the final,
to be swum on the following Saturday, will be a
mile.
The following boats started for the Double
Bay handicap on Saturday last:—Petrel, 28 feet,
half-deck, Imin.; Bronte, 24 feet, open, scratch;
Curlew, 33 feet, open, 3min.; Wingadee, 20 feet,
half-deck, 5mln.; lanthe, 19 feet, half-deck, 13min.;
and Iris. 19 feet, half-deck, 13min. The Bronte
came in first, but by time allowance the Wingadee
took first place, the lanthe second, and the Curlew
third.
Fine weather, a numerous attendance, and
well-contested races left nothing to be desired at
the Canterbury race meeting on Saturday last.
Marony started at 7 to 1 for the Flying Handicap,
which be carried off from Rataplan, Soldier Boy
third; Paul easily defeated Fritz for the Selling
Race, Tait third; Troy, at 10 to 1, won the Autumn
Handicap, by a couple of lengths, from Manfred,
Liberty third; Soldier Boy, 9st. 31b., had an easy
victory over Phyllis, 7st, in the Suburban Handi-
cap, Strathmore third; and Exchange started at 8
to 1, and defeated Salonara, who was splendidly
ridden by Colley, for the Ladles’ Bracelet, Regu-
lator third.
The Moonee Valley (Vie.) races on Satur-
day last resulted as follows:—Hurdle Race: Cla-
vcrley 1, Young Snowden 3, Brighton 3. Half-
Mile Handicap; Pyretta 1, Honora 2, Gymkhana 3.
Seding Race: Sea Serpent], Quietude 3, Pocohon-
tas 3. Handicap Steeplechase; Blackthorn 1, And-
over 3. Three-quarter-mile Handicap: Country-
man 1, Cassiopeia 3> Gympkana 3.
Mudgee sports on 8t. Patrick’s Day:—P.
Garretty tossed the caber 20ft.4in.; “Ferguson’’
covered 16ft. 2in. in the running long jump; T.
Budd vaulted Oft. lin. with the pole; Hugh Kear
showed best on the horizontal bar; L. Cassimer got
over 5ft. 3in. in the running high jump; R. J.
Newton won the St. Patrick’s Day Handicap; and
P. Spies won the Consolation Flutter. Several
minor events were also got through.
In 1882, the progeny of the celebrated
Hermit won upon the turf no less than £44,608.
At the close of 1883, the son of Newminster again
heads the list of winning sires, but as he did not
have so many representatives running, his total
only reached £29,928. With, perhaps, the excep-
tion of Stockwell, there has been no more success-
ful sire than Hermit, and undoubtedly the New-
minster and Stockwell cross has been marvellously
successful.
Taking for bis text a verse from St. Paul’s
Epistle to the Ephesians—“ Take unto you the
armour of God, that you may be able to resist,”
&c.—the Rev. R. J. Mercer recently delivered an
eloquent sermon on “Cricket,” in the Anglican
Church, Clunes (V.), during the course of which
he conclusively proved to himself that cricket is a
manly game, “possessing many spiritual advan-
tages.” That’s so; and it’s the whisky saloon-
keeper that reaps the bulk of them. Now’s the
time for some other apostle to quote St. Matthew’s
words—“But Peter swore he knew not the man,
And immediately the cock crew,”—in order to
enable him to tag on an “eloquentsermon” on the
spiritual advantages to be derived from a Lane
Cove cockfight.
A wordy war has been going on lately as
to the respective merits of A. W. Fittes and W. G.
Brett to the title of amateur champion sculler of
New South Wales. “Cloanthus,” in the Austral-
ian, has rather the best of it when he states that
the Sydney people are quite welcome to call
Brett the champion of New South Wales, so long
as they admit that Fittes defeated him on his
merits and has proved himself the best amateur
sculler In the colonies.
In America, George D. Phillips, the ama-
teur oarsman, athlete, and skater, on Jan. 6, skat-
ing against time, under proper supervision and
upon an accurately-measured straightaway course
on the Harlem River, covered a half-mile in Imin.
30sec., being the fastest amateur record. He had
a strong wind at his back, but the roughness of a
portion of the ice, which caused him to stumble
after going six hundred yards, about made up for
any help gained therefrom.

The dailies are now gushing over the
liberality of Mr. John Bennett’s offer of £300 for
a sculling race for the alleged purpose of finding
out who is the best man to pit against Hanlan. At
first sight the proposal appears liberal enough, but
when looked into, it does not teem that Mr. Ben-
nett is throwing himself away to any great extent,
as the gate money, as it is now termed, would no
doubt more than recoup him. Jf Mr. Bennett
really wants to do the generous, we would suggest
to him that an offer of fifty pounds or a hundred
pounds, with proceeds of steamers added, would
have a more genuine ring about it than the £200
with no mention of “ gate money.”
Fully 2000 rolled up for the St. Patrick's
sports at Bathurst, and the fun was simply
“soobloime.” The Grand Handicap fell to Dowey,
an Orange “stamp-picker,” after a desperate
tussle with Pursehouse, whom he brat by half a
yard; Fitzgerald 3. Young Humphries, who won
the Amateur Cup, had to run a heat more than
his rivals. In the first division he won by two
yards, but, as the judge was not at the post and
the tape was not stretched, the heat had to be run
again; Kingston, 3; and young Tom Hellyer, 3.
Three or four hundred roughs crowded the track
during every flutter, and at Stapleton's booth the
dear little shamrock was drowned beyond redemp-
tion.

ing bowlers in the Intercolonial Bowling match to

At one time there was a suspicion abroad
that Hanlan, the oarsman, had his boat rigged out
with some sort of a wheeled contrivance at the
bottom that made it move through the water with
greater velocity than the use of the oars alone
could acc9mplish. Hanlan denied this, and the
world believed him; still there were plenty of
A Diminished Ton.
“ Don’t forget to order home a ton of coal, dear. Here
is the money. It’s a one pound note. We are all out.”
“ Dear ” goes in with the pound to get it “ changed,” and
comes out about a crown short.
“ Dear ” meets a friend, and another crown breaks
loose from the original pound.
“Dear” says: “Lemme see—(Lie)—half-a-ton will do—
(hie)— plenty. Lea have another!”
“Dear” meets more frienda, and the balance
shrinks rapidly to half-a-crown.
But “ Dear ” is equal to the opcasion, and gets a bushel
and murmurs, faintly bpt fondly c ’Ere J be, an’—(hie)—
brought ther coal home myself—(hie)—to save expense.”

oarsmen who “couldn’t see ” how he got over the
course so rapidly. Then the rumour began circu-
lating that he greased the bottom of his boat with
a new kind of oil that did away with all friction.
This also was denied by Hanlan, who said that the
only grease he used was “ elbow grease;” but still
his rivals “couldn't see” how he made such
wonderful time. Those who know the grt at oars-
man best say that everything about his rowing
has been open to inspection. There has only been
one thing his adversaries really couldn’t see, and
that was—his back.
T. M. Malone must be a wonderful runner,
if the times are correct that he is credited with.
At Cootamundra, ia the second division of the
Grand Handicap, he was put back two yards, and
yet was stated to have won in 15 seconds; and, in
the final, he finished within a yard of M'Tieron,
the time being given as seconds I Rot I The
fact is, half the races run in the country are
started by the competitors themselves, as, in nine
cases out of ten, if the men jump away well to-
gether, the pistol goes after the men are well on
their journey. The same thing happens in boat
racing. We have pulled in a fair number of races,
and on nearly every occasion have we started the
contest ourselves, and with pretty well a length to
the good. If a field of men are in anything like a
line, with the starter’s flag raised, and one man
jumps away, ten to one the official will drop his
flag, if he is anything but an old hand at the game.
Not long ago the Murdocks, Spofforths,
and Bonnors of Muswellbrook stepped across to
show the Scone scrubbers how to play cricket
with real cricketing tools, and to prove to their
benighted brethren the advantages of the said
weapons over the customary rag ball, half-paling
bats, and empty kerosene.tin wickets. We met
one of the Brook team a few days after. His collar
bone was badly cracked in three places, one of his
eyes was wandering about his cheek, his left ear
was squelched flat, no two fingers on his hands
pointed in the same direction, and his nose looked
like a piece of raw beef stretched tightly across a
nutmeg grater. According to his own ac-
count, the ball bumped, and hit him badly, but
the guard who was in the same van with the
cricketers when they returned says the battered
ball-punisher had no show with the other fellow,
who belted him all round the truck, and finally
hoisted him out on his head through the window.
It was a very sultry sort of a day at Scone, and
they served the beer in a bucket. Hence this
thusness.
In a letter to the New York Police
Gazette, Prof. Wm. Miller says:—“In reference
to Muldoon’s challenge I must state that Muldoon
and myself have contested only four times—once
in the Rink in Third avenue, New York ; twice
In Baltimore, namely, at the Masonic Temple, and
then at the Maryland Institute, in all of which
matches Muldoon suffered defeat at my hands.
We also contested at the Madison Square Garden,
whicn. match ended in a draw. Tu'is, so far* I
have considerably the best of it, as Muldoon has
never beaten me. The proof of the pudding is in
the eating of it; so let Muldoon show some news-
paper notices of any match, as mentioned in his
letter, giving the name of the hall or theatre and
city in which such contest took place, as there is
no denying black and white. I may state that I
have issued a challenge to box John L. Sullivan
for $3500 a side allowing him $500 expenses; the
match to take place in Australia or New Zealand.
If said challenge is nR accepted, it is my intention
to go to America early next year and settle as to
who is the champion at boxing, and when that
matter is settled I shall be prepared to meet all
wrestlers for the champirnship.”
Says a Yankee exchange: “Judging from
Information I have received from home and
abroad, the approaching aquatic season will be a 1
busy one. List year Teemer joined the front
rank, by being victorious, accidentally, over
Hanlan, while George Hosmer and Hamm and
Conley got a step higher on the ladder of fame. As
to the relative merit* of these men, there was a
variety of opinions last year, and during the
winter they have not grown less in number.
When Teemer was victorous in the Hulton regatta,
his 'riends claimed him the equal, if not the better
of Hanlan, and to-day there are thousands of
dollars ready to back him against any sculler in
the world. Hanlan. on the other band, has a long
line of records behind him, and will certainly not
refuse to row any man, if a substantial stake be
forthcoming. So it is safe to conclude that Teemer
and Hanlan will this year row for the world •
championship. However much Courtney may
talk, there is no likelihood of his rowing Hanlan,
but there is a probability of Ross and the latter
testing conclusions. Such a race would be re-
garded with interest by the whole world, because
Ross has many friends who yet think he can defeat
Hanlan. Hosmer will row Courtney or Ross, and
both Hamm and Conley have trieuds who will
back them against any of the three.”
The Yass Courier is pretty good on snake
varns but we reckon it has to play second “bosh”
to the Chico (U.S.) Record, which says:-“ One of
the most novel teams on record is owned by a boy
in Tehama. The young fellow’s flyers are nothing
more or less than two large sturgeons, which were
caught by his father in the Sacramento River.
The boy’s name is Frank Cooper. He has fastened
an end of a strong rope to the tail of each fish, and
the other end is fastened to the bow of an eighteen-
font boat. Two cords, fastened in some manner to
the fish serve as reins, and the owner of the team
guides his fishy chargers up or down stream at
will The other day he took a spin up the river to
Red'Bluff, accompanied by three other boys, and
nt that place the curious outfit attracted much
attention. Young Cooper contemplates atrip to
Chico, and if the trip thus far is successful, he will
lav in a stock of supplies and continue his
meanderings to Sacramento. The first day the
horses’ were hitched up they ‘bucked’
with all the energy of a throrough-bred. untamed,
Mexican mustang, jumping and plunging out of
the water, and diving down as far as their harness
would permit. But they have been broken
snlendidly, and cause no trouble to their proud
driver When they are not in use the fish are
driven into a largo cage, which was made
expressly for them.
The long-talked-of glove fight between
Foley’s clever pupil and a well-known Surry Hills
man who comes of a fighting family, was decided
at Botany on Tuesday week last, for an alleged £5
trophy The betting was 3 to 1 on Foley’s pupil,
and he justified the confidence placed in him by
knocking his opponent to a standstill m three
rounds The winner is a first-class athlete, and,
besides being the most scientific amateur boxer
we have ever seen perform, he excels at rowing,
cricket and football. When in boxing attitude he
Bfnnds right foot and hand foremost, which makes
him doubly awkward to a man used always to set-
to wfth left-handed men. By the way, “profes-
sors” of the noble art assert that men who stand
right hand in front leave themselves open, and
invariably try and induce them to change. But
we & faU to see it in the same light, as, when right
and left-handed men are standing via-a-yts, they
are in exactly the same position to each other, and
if one is left open the other must be so to a cor-
resnonding degree. In our opinion the man stand-
ing P right hand foremost has all the best of it, as
he is used to setting-to with men in the style
ounosing him, while his opponent is all astray with
the strange attitude. We have always imagined
thl reason to be that tutors of the “ art find it so
much easier to teach a man in the orthodox
fashion. ,
After enjoying good skating until it be-
came a trifle monotonous to them, a party of
youths on a large pond at Clifton, Staten Island
ctt s I introduced a novelty with which to make
the pastime more exciting. The innovation con-
Biatpfi of what they called a “whizzer.” The
“'whizzer ”was made by cutting a hole in the ice
nlacing an upright pole through the hole, and
attaching two horizontal bars to it. The bars were
about fifteen feet long and on opposite sides of the
upright pole. A dozen boys would catch hold of
the bars and begin to skate around, after the
manner of sailors winding a capstan. The result
would bo that the boy near the pole would be
moving in a circle at a very moderate pace, while
those on the outer edges were whirling around at
a terrific speed, and if they chanced to let go of
the “ whizzer,” they would be hurled forward as if
shot from a catapult. The excitement of the sport
consisted in watching the gyrations of those who
let go. One lad named Willie Dearborne loosened
his grasp on the bar, was hurled forward about
fifty feet, and after sliding most of the distance on
the ice, went home with the left side of his face
almost devoid of skin and bleeding profusely.
Another boy named Daniel Simpson tripped, went
gyrating over the ice, and was carried off with
sprained wrists and a broken knee-pan. Charles
FJynn tripped and fell, and before he could get
out of the way, the other bar came around and
one of its occupants struck Flynn in the head with
a skate-gutter, and he also was helped from the
pond suffering from concussion of the brain and a
large gap in his scalp. The “ whizzer ” was then
stooped for the afternoon.
Sydneyites have ever been noied for their
homage to muscular Christianity, out never in
their wildest flights have they carried it to such an
Idiotic extreme as they have done in the case of
Edward Hanlan. There was some excuse so far as
Trickett was concerned, as ho was Sydney born,
and his fe'low townsmen naturally made a fuss
over his defeat of the Champion of the World, but
Hanlan comes to them a perfect stranger, his only
recommendation being that he is a phenomenal
sculler. We can understand a man possessed of
the gift of the gab and a very scanty knowledge
of the Queen’s English making a bid for cheap
notoriety by appearing as often as possible in
public with a man who is an object, of curiosity to
the crowd, but there are men chasing the sculler
about in a manner which is not conducive to the
dignity of their position or a tribute to their good
sense. Hanlan is evidently a big lift above the
general run of professional scullers, and it would
seem more his misfortune than his fault that he is
hunted about in such a pitiless manner. One of
the most persistent of his persecutors has been the
D.T. reporter, who appears to be as great an au-
thority on rowing as a pig would be of a diamond
necklace, judging from the account he gave of
Hanlan’s first row on Australian waters. He says:
“ That an oarsman was stepping into the boat was
unmistakable. Boats are generally held for scul-
lers, but with Hanlan it was like stepping on to the
wall.” And all through the half-column of gush-
ing twaddle he writes of the Canadian rowing
with a pair of oars. It is for the information of
the D.T. man—and not our readers—we state that
any sculler having pretentions to being a water-
man can perform the feat which made the D.T.
man’s hair stand on end ; and that the Champion,
as a rule, rows with a pair of sculls. Put him on
the “ Shandridan Papers,” by all means. ’
At Grafton, on Friday last, T. Noud and
C. Lintott, ran 100 yards for £50. Noud got well
away, and won by three yards. Another match
for £20 aside, 150 yards, was subsequently run be-
tween Noud, jun., and G. H. Willis, the Jatter re-
ceiving one yard start. Noud soon overhauled
Willis, led him at ICO yards, and beat him by one
yard, in the alleged time of 15 seconds, which is
given in several papers, Granny amongst the
number, as correct. What ridiculous nonsense to
publish in all seriousness that young Noud had
equalled the late C. Westhall’s celebrated 150 yards,
run at Manchester in 1851; and that Willis had run
within two yards of evens. After both the
Grafton races the blackguard scenes so common
amongst professional peds, came olf ns a matter
of course. Lintott objected to the stakes being
f»aid over, on the ground that the starter had al-
owed his opponent to get four yards over the
crease before he fired the pistol; and at the ter-
mination of the second event, Willis wanted to
fight Noud. It is stated a “double cross” had
been worked in this race, and that it was a case of
biter bit. Willis, the winner of the second prize
in Bush’s handicap, from all accounts, has rather a
shady reputation in the ped. line. In the nomi-
nation form he gave his occupation as that of a
shopboy in Sydney, but he afterwards acknow-
ledged that he was residing on a station near
Cootamundra, where he is getting colonial experi-
ence, and that he had been nominated as Willis for
the Cootamundra Handicap, where he got a start
of 16 yards, but the acceptance being late, he went
and started as Turner from 9 yards, and won third
prize, which the committee psid over after repri-
manding him. The Grafton committee have held
over the money, pending enquires. Mr. Willis is
evidently picking up colonial experience in any-
thing but a slow manner.

The Arithmetic of Cribbage.
“ Do you know,” said Mrs. Bilkins as
she came into the parlour where her husband
was yawningTbehlnd his evening paper. “ Do you
know, dear, I think that Willie is studying
altogether too hard at school? Why, he’s only
eleven this month, and yet they have let him
take up the hardest kind of arithmetic. I was
upstairs just now, and passing his door I heard
him saying his lesson over in his sleep. I know he
was asleep, because it’s after ten now, and besides
he got the numbers all jumbled together. I tell
you he’ll have brain fever or something if we
don’t take him out of school for a while until his
body develops more.” “ Nonsense,” replied Mr.
Bilkins, who had been a bos- once himrelf. “ You
just imagined you heard him talk. I’ll go up
and see if he’ll talk when I’m around.”
Mr, Bilkins’ slippered feet made no noise what-
ever on the stairway or in the ball. Upon reach-
ing the room where his two sons—Willie, 11; and
Frank, 9—were supposed to be sleeping, he put
his ear to the key-hole and listened. Presently he
heard the voice of Willie: “Fifteen, two; fifteen,
four; a pair is six; his Nobs is seven, and a run of
three are thirteen.” “ What’s in the crib ?” broke
in Frank. But the old man didn’t wait to hear any
any mere. He slipped quietly down stairs, got a
trunk strap and returned. Two minutes later
some of the tallest yelling that ever had been
heard in the Bilkins neighbourhood emanated
from that room, and fora week afterwards the two
young arithmeticians couldn’t sit down to thoir
meals.

There is now in Sands’ window the most
interesting picture of Mrs. Langtry yet exhibited
in Sydney. It is a large proof engraving of a por-
trait by Millais, painted from life when the Jersey
Lily was in the blush of her girlish beauty. Many,
perhaps most people, who look at her late photo-
graphs are disappointed, and fail to see where the
beauty lies that has msde her so famous. It is
more apparent in this picture than in any we have
seen; and, as in all her photographs, Mrs. Langtry
wears the simplest toilet. She is standing, three-
quarter face, in an easy-iltting black dress of some
soft material, and there la ho attempt to “ make ”
a figure in the way usually adopted by actresses,
or even to display it by any trick of posture. Her
white lace cuifs reveal a large hand uolding a lily, I
and the wide lace collar is very low on the neck—
there is no other ornament. There is none of the
hardness seen latterly in the rather thin face; it is
reliued and ealm, with that indescribable charm
in the eyes which nearly all her photographs fall
to reproduce; and the hair is loosely fringed and
knotted behind. The whole aspect of the face is
different from hers now. It is decidedly that of
an vnginue, poetical and pensive. Mrs. Langtry
had, even then, a full-sized useful mouth, yet no
one can look on Millais's portrait and deny that
face is full of spirituelfe beauty.

day. We have it on the authority of the best
painters that Miss Pharaoh, whose complexion the
Egyptian mashers were never tired of admiring,
used one when she went to the river and picked up
little Moses. But the ancient maidens had one ad-
vantage over Sydney girls in using parasols—they
knew how to manage them better. They didn’t
trip about the streets of Memphis or Palmyra
knocking hats off, and prodding people in the
cheeks with projecting spokes, with such airy
insouciance as the daughters of men do now.
They didn’t carry these essentially ‘feminine
weapons cuddled to their breast with one hand
while the butt-end stuck out over their shoulder
at exactly the height of the average man’s eye.
No; the Egyptian girl let the carrying be done by
a slave behind, who knew that it her carelessness
resulted in anyone’s eyes being gouged out, there
would be trouble. It Is different now. It is only
In these civilised times that the parasol has become
a thing of such complicated beauty, and an object
of terror to brave men. He who ventures to pro-
menade upon those portions of the pavement in
this town particularly affected by the fair sex, has
to be very flexible to successfully dodge the be-
headed, lace-edged, crewel-worked, crook-handled
weapons which on all sides flutter within an inch
of his shrinking eye. Whether in the street, on the
Blatform, in the cars, on the lawn, it’s all the same.

substance on oculists, and only take a limited view
of the world. We shall go through life with a

glare begotten of an artificial orb. And yet we

to ask this young lady to carry her sunshade pro-
perly. She would fix us with a stare, and probably
utter the word * brute I’ ” So it is. There is a law
against the carrying of concealed weapons. But
what shall we do with the charming creatures who
carry these exposed ones ?

On Friday night, the friends of Mr. Nor-
man Selfe, G.E., held a social gathering in the
Balmain School of Arts, to wish him farewell. He
leaves for England to-day, by the City of Sydney.
After the banquet came speeches, interspersed
with songs by Messrs. Milne, H. Selfe, Davidson,
P, Jones, &o. Mr. George Davidson, who presided,
proposed he toast of “ Our Guest," whose life of
Industry aod undoubted talents had won for him
as a professional man a position second to that of
no other civil engineer iu the Australian colonies.
Mr. Selfe replied, admitting that his career had
been one much more given to business than to the
softer graces of society. Other toasts, and “ Auld
Lang Syne ” brought the close of a cheerful even-
ing.

The German Club celebrated the birthday
of the Emperor of Germany at their rooms, on
Saturday, by a banquet. Some 70 gentlemen,
nearly ail natives of Kaiser Wilhelm’s domain,
attended, and the place was decorated with flags,
portraits, &o. Mr. Von der Heyde presided, and
Mr. Carl Sahl, Consul in Sydney, proposed “ His
Majesty" and "The Queen.” afterwards, the
German Club Liedertafel rendered some beautiful
music under Herren Kretschmann and Sussmllch,
the company breaking up at midnight.

Mr. W. H. Giddy, who has been secretary
to the Sydney Liedertafel for nearly two years, was
presented with the first golden lyre of the society
on Saturday night and also witn a photographed
group of the members. Sir P. Jennings spoke
most highly of him in making the presentation,
and Mr. Giddy regretted that he had to retire
from the society, which now comprises 1000 sub-
scribers, and 80 singing members. Then Mr. W. H.
Paling was the receiver of a handsomely written
address in acknowledgment of his musical worth,
and of the fine present of an Krard grand piano
he had made to the Liedertafel.

The Wagga branch of the Hibernian
Benefit Society celebrated St. Patrick’s Day with a
grand ball and supper in the Freemason’s Hall,
which was tastefully decorated. There were about
eighty couples present. The music was supplied
by Professor Broadhurst, assisted by Mr. Lilly,
master of the Wagga Brass Band. The supper was
very well got up by Mr. E, Spring, of the Sports-
man’s Arms Hotel. The Mayor and Mayoress (Mr.
and Mrs. James Gormly) were present, as well as
Miss Gormly and Mr. Louis Gormly. Among the
many admirable dresses were two of pink tarlotan
trimmed with lace, worn by a pair of sisters from
Newtown; ruby satin, worn by the Mayoress;
black velvet and silver flowers; pale blue satin
with hand-painted flowers; several whites, and a
very pretty water-wove silk. Newtown sent the
belle in green tarietan, which was much admired,
as was the young lady who wore it, both for her
dancing and good looks. A very attentive com-
mittee carried out all arrangements, and just as
day was breaking the company dispersed, after
spending an enjoyable evening.

Sydney, Wednesday.
Dearest BEt-iiE,— You want me to tell you
about Haulan ? Well, what can I say, excepting 1
that he is a nice-looking, manly fellow, with most
unassuming 1 manners ? His modesty has urged him
to protest against this Hanlan-worship of ours,
and our well-meaning, but dull citizens were some
time before they discovered he was in earnest.
No picnic, entertainment, nor dinner was con-
sidered perfect last week unless graced by his
presence, and all the girls’ hearts “ have gone out
to him.” How easy it is to become famous, after
all!
Madame Marius and Miss Eva Thompson purpose
giving a series of six matinees if sufficient induce-
ment should offer. Their object is to enable those
who live too far away to attend evening concerts
to have an opportunity of hearing good music.
There is to be one matinee each week, and
they are to be held in the new Masonic
Hall. I hope their venture will succeed, but
one can never tell how the Sydney people will
take to a new idea. Matinees, as a rule, are not
popular here, but if once they could be made
fashionable, ladies would attend them whether
they enjoyed them or not. There’s no doubt, dear,
we are slaves to fashion. I was particularly con-
vinced of this one day last week. We had gone to
Baumann’s for some refreshments, and were
Eatiently awaiting our turn to be served, when I
eard a little girl who was sitting near us exclaim,
“Oh, mamma, I am so hungry! when will they
bring us something?” “Have a little more
patience, dear; I daresay seme one will think of
us soon.” “Do you always have to wait so long,
ma ?” “ Nearly always, dear.” “ Then why don’t
you go somewhere else ?” “ Because, love, this is
fashionable.” The little one was silenced, but I
couldn’t help thinking what a pity it is that so ex-
cellent an establishment as Baumann’s is in every
other respect should be marred by the indifferent
attendance. I have often seen people go out after
having exhausted their patience in waiting. Surely
it would be wiser to employ more hands than to
lose custom in this way!
The Sydney masher gets more and more aggres-
sive every day, and there are times when he looks
such a poor, helpless creature. Yesterday one was
hurrying to catch his tram, when his beautifully
tapered-toed boot caught in the line, which sent
him sprawling on all fours. It was fine entertain-
ment for the street larrikins, who lost no time in
hemming in our noble hero. One seized his um-
brella, whilst another tried on his hat and struck
a masher attitude. The poor masher, who, by
reason of his stiff collar and tight pants, was not
altogether expeditious in his movements, pre-
sented a pitiful spectacle when he did “find his
trottes,” as the larrikins expressed it. And yet
another instance of a dude’s manliness. A little
child was running along the street, when it tripped
and I ell. One of these dressed-up puppets was
passing at the time, but with just a glance at the
screaming child it passed on, and took no more
I notice, and I wonder if It felt ashamed when a
common larrikin went and picked the little one
up and set it on its feet as gently as any woman.
And yet these things are what we call men, Ugh 1
I have seen no dresses worthy of notice at the
Theatre circles this week. Black satins and grena-
dines are the favourites, enlivened of course by
flowers and ribbons. Lace pelerines are very use-
ful, as they can be worn over almost any dress for
evening wear,and look so dressy. Marabout feather
trimming is to be extensively worn this season,
and as much bijouterie on your walking costumes
as you please. Cloak or mantle clasps are made of
nickel, silver, or gold, and they are worn as large
as a crown-piece, and even larger. I saw an absurd
use made of one of those large tortoiseshell hair-
pins with the gilt top: it was fastened in a bat as
an ornament 1 When there are such beautiful hat
ornaments to be got, it seems to me very stupid to
use hairpins for this purpose The latest thing in
fans takes the form, colour aad size of a large leaf.
The raised veins are represented by means of an
ornamentation of flowers and birds. The back
of the fan d la mode is lined with a highly con-
trasting colour, as this new shape is generally
longer on one side than the other; so this colour
shows when the fan is closed, and looks well.
Frequenters of the Block are already donning
their winter costumes, and very rich and tasteful
some of them are. Autumn brown and elephant
colour are amongst the favourites. 1 also hear
whispers of dull reds, but hardly think they will
find much favour, being so dreadfully unbecom-
ing. A pretty little blonde wore, on the Block,
this week, a mixture of browns, which was very
effective. The skirt was quite plain, and composed
of seal brown ottoman cord, the long redingote
was a lighter shade in velvet,, whilst the hat and
feathers were almost of a golden hue. Some
thought had evidently been spent over the cos-
tume, and the result was very happy. With a
merino dress, plush tippets of the same colour
look very stylish. A dark green shot satin with
panels of brocade edged with deep cream Madras
lace was almost too gorgeous for a walking
costume—but looked very handsome. Indeed.
Just one pretty white dress 1 saw to-day,
and, as it will probably be the last of
the season, I shall attempt to describe it.
The finest Indian muslin made with baby body and
two deep flounces to form the' skirt; each flounce
was beautifully worked and edged with fine lace.
Encircling the waist was a silver zone, and the hat
was a large leghorn with white feathers. Hardly
a diess is made now without tucks. Even in the
thickest materials, I have seen them ; but, of
course, they look best when the material is soft
and pliable. No wonder the dressmakers charge
so high for making a dress I Just imagine the
time it mast take to run—say—even three tucks in
each flounce, and very few are contented with
three. For my part, I much prefer the narrow
velvet rim on the flounces to the tucks. The long
kid glove is rapidly being displaced by velvet
gauntlets, which are made in any colour ; but
when next, dean you commission me to purchase
you some gloves, send the exact measure of
your hand, as, now-a-days, the sizes vary so,
there is no trusting them. It is quite usual, now,
to go to the French glove shop to be measured for
gloves, just as they do in Paris. And shoes are
made with cloth tops. In any plaid or colour to go
with the costume. I hear that in Paris they are
actually trimming bonnets with cork, and chenille
is used for almost everything—chenille fringe,
chenille flowers, and even chenille muffs. I am
glad, for it is really beautiful when of the best.
Mr. Giddy, the late secretary of the Liedertafel,
was presented with the first golden lyre by the
members last Saturday night, prior to his depar-
ture from Sydney. In him the Liedertafel will lose
one of its most valuable members, and we shall
mlps*his familiar face amongst the bassos at the
concerts sorely. Heigho! there’s always someone
going away. And row the thought of it has
brought a lump into my throat, and a mist before
my eyes, and nas driven all the rest of my news
out of my head. Ever your affectionate
MAB.
P.S.—I have sufficiently recovered to remember
that I have told you never a word of the Lieder-
tafel concert 1 However, It will keep till next
week, and I promise you I will not forget to give
you a full account.

THE GORE HILL ESTATE,
Comprising 241 lots, amongst which are business
sites and residence sites, the equal of which
are not likely again to be in the market.
With an elevation of 300 feet above sea level, the
future residents on Gore Hill will look down on
their brethren in the city and the railway suburbs,
whilst between stretches that lovely panorama of
the harbour—the river, Biloela, Goat island, &c.—
which only Port Jackson affords. The pen of
Forbes would fall to convey to the reader an
adequate idea of the charming loveliness which
spreads out to the vision from Gore’s Hill. The
most beautiful drive around Sydney—and we take
this statement advisedly—is that from the Crow’s
Nest along the main Lane Cove-road past Gore’s
Hill.
Imagine, if you can, what our railway suburbs
frota Redferu to Parramatta would be jf, Instead
of an elevation of from 32 to 100 feet, the height
shown on railway time-table, they had the splendid
elevation of Gore's Hill, 300 feet.
Imagine what an exodus there will be to these
high lands as soon as facilities are afforded,
whether by railway or tramway, or both, for
access to and from the city.
That the railway to connect the Great Northern
Railway and St. Leonards, money for which was
voted last session, must be speedily commenced, is
evident. Is it likely in the interests of economy
that the vast bulk of the products of the north
are to be unnecessarily hauled some seven or eight
miles ? The railway from St. Leonards to Pearce’s
corner could be commenced and built whilst the
bridge is being erected across the Parramatta
River at Ryde.
What land such as Gore’s Hill will be worth
when the railway is a fact, the most san-
guine even of local landholders would not be able
to guess.
Only miles from Mllson’s Point.
Only 3 miles from the city.
Nearer than Petersham is to Redfern,
Nearer than Stanmore Is to the Town Had,
will Gore’s Hill be to the City.
To those who do not know the property, wc say
inspect it before the sale.
The omnibuses to Lane Cove and to the Great
Northern Hotel pass the Estate; it is not too much
of a walk for any man.|
The streets are all cleared and formed, name-
posts erected, every lot marked out and pegs
numbered, so that identification is easy.
The finest bricks are manufactured in the im-
mediate neighbourhood, and can be obtained at
lower prices than at tit. Leonards or in the city.

Good frontages. Liberal depths. Wide streets.
The Terms are liberal, buyers having the choice

not do so again. “Oh, how good you are! ex-
claimed the little daisy. “But then perhaps you
don’t know how naughty the song is ? ” And she
struck up, in a voice loud enough to be heard all
over the church, a ditty which his Reverence con-
sidered so fearful that he requested her to write it
out for his more deliberate consideration.
There is a pretty little bit of writing some-
where about a maiden who was good and beauti-
ful and who hopped into bed leaving a snowy
mound of warm, soft, white apparel on the floor,
v 0 w, says a brutal Yankee, when the lovely
woman skips into between the sheets the tradition-
al snow-heap resembles nothing so much as a
kaleidoscope gone wrong, what with black stock-
ings and bronze boots, pale blue under-flannels,
pink flannel skirt trimmed with black lace, cherry
balmoral embroidered with olive floss, corsets of
hunters’ green finished with scarlet, &c , &c.
A late development in American society is
the “correct grammar" craze, and only those happy
individuals who are comparatively perfect in their
phraseology dare to let their speech come trip-
pingly from the tongue. Says “ IJna:”—“ I shiver
before the objective case, and stand abashed at
awkward pronouns. The craze has permeated all
classes; and I approach the sales-ladles in my
ribbon-shop even with a consciousness that my
grammar Is being criticised. I have heard them
discussing it behind the counter.” Under these
circumstances, perhaps, it’s just as well that
Consul Kahlo has postponed his excursion with
our “representative men.” The grammar craze
may blow over in a while.
We can never see any mention of the
Marquis of Bute and his three hundred thousand
a year without calling to mind an interesting
anecdote connected with the great man’s marriage
day : but, as it’s a most “ select ” little story, you
must promise not to let it go any further. Well,
just this: After the Marchioness had retired to
rest on the evening of that auspicious day,
“hubby” failed to follow suit for some time-
hours, in fact. Quite alarmed at his uncomfort-
able absence, “my lady’s own” maid was de-
spatched on a voyage of discovery, and found the
noble, but not ardent, bridegroom fast asleep In
the drawing-room. It’s needless to mention that
the Marquis makes a good husband. Men of his
matter-of-fact disposition always do.
From “Woman Chat, by Volatile Miss,” in
the Newcastle Herald, we cull the following:—
“ We have few concerts in Sydney now, and the
result is—we are complaining of ennui. And they
pay so well that I wonder why some musicians do
not arrange for a'few high-class concerts.” The
trouble is that they pay too well. Look at the pile
Withelmj went home with, and how very nearly
Kate Thayer had to walk back I Look how splen-
didly Charles Huenerbein did with his popular
concerts, and what a gigantic fortune the lady has
made who declined to sing for the Highland
Society. Kowalski, too, was a splendid attraction;
and the Bully-Powley concerts at the Royal
brought in gigantic returns. We are inclined to
think this “Miss” v®ry volatile, indeed. We
wonder what her name is ? But it’s Sal, of course I
-Sal Volatile!
Princesses don't seem to have always been
such very delectable creatures. Princess Caroline,
for instance, wife of the “first gentleman in
Europe” is put through thusly by a recent writer:
“ Stout, painted, raddled, with a large head and
short neck, a quantity of light hair gathered in an
untidy knot under a monstrous beaver hat, quick
heady eyes deep sunk in their orbits, and a scarcity
of clothing Ill-suited to so overblown a figure. A
lilac-silk pelisse was negligently open, displaying
a short-waisted robe of thinnest sprigge 1 muslin,
through the lower part of which was plainly visible
a pair of thick ankles and wrinkled stockings.”
We are also delicately informed that her dress
“ was of the crumpled, flashy kind which is worn
by vulgar drabs. The stockings, of common
thread, were wofully unclean.” and water
did not agree either with the sweet Caroline, for
we find that the Regent had to lecture her on the
desirability of washing and of eschewing dirty
underlines It was the charming Caroline, it will
be remembered, who posed for a time before the
public as a saint and martyr. Perhaps this
saintly game accounts for her many other attrac-
tive attributes.
Lord Garmoyle’s mamma says his mar-
riage with Miss Fortescue, the actress, will kill
her, so the dutiful boy has broken off his engage-
ment. Another reason also moved him to the dis-
honourable step, to wit, a statement made to him by
the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, that his be-
trothed would not be received at Court. Con-
sidering that old Lady Cairns comes of stock not a
whit better than the Fortescues, that old Lord
Cairns has himself sprung from the ranks, that the
Duke of Richmond’s great-great-great-grand-
mamma was the courtesan and spy, de Queronaille,
that reception at Court is no stamp of worth
since notorious and demireps have the entree
there, and that not a word has ever been breathed
against Miss P.’s character, Qarmoyle'8 conduct
is only explicable on the probably perfectly cor-
rect hypothesis that the fellow’s an infernal snob.
Old Cairns offers Miss Fortescue £10,000 as solatium,
but the Fortescue doesn’t see it. Although Gar-
moyle can’t be worth a bad sixpence, the title of
Countess, with all the attendant deference, and a
life of ease, and what is known as distinction, are
worth something. 8 > she sues for £40,000. Some-
thing like a breach of promise case, that I The old
couple, Lord and Lady Cairns, behaved just as
skunkishly as their cub of a son. They received
the girl as his betrothed, had her visiting at their
house, and all the time were secretly moving
heaven and earth to prevent their cub from keep-
ing faith with her. Imagine the torture they have
inflicted, if the girl was really in love with the
dude. Girls have broken their hearts for just as
dirty, inferior, little skunks, ere now.
The question of woman’s rights has been
most curiously before the United States Govern-
ment. Mrs. Mary Miller, of Louisiana, applied for
a license as master of a river steamer. In a long
and peculiarly poetical minute on her application,
the Treasury Solicitor observes: “ There is no ex-
press provision in the law to prevent a woman
commanding a steamer. Neither is there anything
in the Constitution to prevent a woman being
elected to Congress, or made President, or to pre-
vent her commanding a ship of war or the army.
The law is silent as to sex.” But, nevertheless, the
Solicitor sees numberless reasons why women
should, law apart, be barred from unsexing occu-
pations; and, after describing at length the various
rough-and-tumble duties which pertain to the
master of a Mississippi steamer, he considers that
Mrs. Mary Miiler should rest content as “the
Priestess who ministers at the shrine of the house-
hold gods.” Mr. Secretary Folger, however, over-
ruled this view, saying: “I see no reason, in,
written or unwritten law, why Mrs. Miller, if com-
petent, should be refused the license. Nor is there
any need of any'talk, pro or con., on the social
status, or on woman’s rights, so called. Having
been put on God’s footstool by Him, she has the
right to win her bread in a moral and decent way,
which is open to any of His toiling creatures. It
she chooses to do so as master of a steam vessel, it
is an honest calling, and if she is fitted, though
clothed in skirts rather than breeches, she has the
right to follow it, and no one should say her nay. ’
So Mrs. Mary Miller is to be examined, and if she
knows enough, will be boss of the boat.
An exchange prints an article entitled
“Work for Girls.” Of course that is what a man
may expect to do if he intends to rear a family.
Jacob of old knew all about that. He worked
fourteen years for one girl and got another one
from the same family thrown in. The modern
young man has to work in the first place to get
the girl, and after he has got her he must settle
down to business and work for her and all the
others she may see fit to present him with. Cer-
tainly. Our exchange is right. But what’s the
use of giving advice on a dead sure thing like
that?
Egbert S. Sinclair, the only heir to a
Louisiana planter’s fortune, was married in a
romantic manner last Dec. The nuptials occurred
at a candy-pull given by a prominent merchant.
Miss Lizzie Jones, a charming young blonde of
eighteen, was one of the merry-makers. Sinclair
fell violently in love with her. The attachment
proved to be mutual. Toward the close of the
candy-bee Sinclair whispered words of love to the
fair Lizzie, and proposed marriage. To his surprise,
she accepted him, and insisted on being wedded
on the spot. A resident Congregational clergy-
man who was present consented to perform the
ceremony, and did. With both bands full of candy
1 they stood in front of the fireplace while the knot
was tied. It was the sweetest wedding ever known i
in Macon. After a tour through the Southern
States they returned to the young lady’s house to
spend a few days before going to Now Orleans to
' live. 'I here Sinclair saw his wife’s sister for the
i first time. She is only 14 years old, but is the
I acknowledged beauty of the High School. Sinclair
became infatuated with her pretty face and win-
ning ways. He was constantly by her side out of
school hours. Being a fine musician, hevoluntered
to become her tutor. They spent hours together
at the piano. The young wife became jealous, and
with tear-dimmed eyes implored her husband to
lavish a little attention on herself. He treated the
matter lightly, and said that his conduct was
i merely that of an affectionate brother, and she
appeared satisfied. At midnight, on 23th Deo., a
coach drove up to the old mansion. The driver
was a negro. The blinds parted from an upper
window, and a manly face appeared. It was Sin-
clair’s. He gave a low whistle, to which the driver
responded with a flourish of his whip. A minute
later Sinclair, accompanied by a little woman
heavily muffled, hurried from the house into the
coach, the horses were urged forward, and in a
moment the conveyance vanished. Early next
morning the young bride was thrown into con-
vulsions upon ascertaining that her husband and
her sister had eloped.
Early last Christmas morning, a policeman
applied to the Presbyterian Hospital, New York,
for an ambulance for the conveyance of a dying
man. It shortly returned with its ill-fated occu-
pant, but medical skill was unavailing. Ho had
taken a poisonous dose of morphine, and died be-
fore noon. “But, why,” you will say, “go so far
as New York to stand by a suicide’s death-bed ?
Have we not our own luxuriant crop of self-
murders on which to moralise?” True. But the
sorroundings of this were rare and romantic. The
man was young, handsome, and noble. He had
graduated at Bonn; he had health and competence
and—yes, it’s the old story. A year ago, young
Baron Von Sternberger landed in New York. His
first employment was in a restaurant. You know
what that means. Had he been a political “ bum-
mer,” or a flatulent orator, he would, probably,
have obtained a State appointment, or at least
have been run for Congress; but, being only a
cultivated German gentleman, of course he had to
take to cleaning boots or waiting on hodmen.
Then he got a job in Mr. Hesse’s drug store, at
one dollar a week and found. He was very re-
ticent: but, at last, it leaked out by parcels that
his father was recently dead, and the estate in the
hands of trustees, one of whom was a professor at
the young man’s university. It fuither transpired
(in newspaper jargon) that the youth had been
“wild” at Bonn, and had drunk to the dregs the
cups most of us have at one time or another sipped
—love and debt. Of his debt we can only surmise
that the creditor was a person with short podgy
fingers and predatory Eastern profile Of his love
we know more. Praulein Maria Marx, his fiancee,
was a sweet girl, the beauty of whose face (ns
three-volume novelists say) was only to be excelled
by that of her mind. We give you the face, so you
can judge for yourselves. Of her mind we can
only guess by her last letter to her sweetheart, and
it is so tender—so full of true womanliness—that
we can understand Von Sternberger’s killing a rival
in a duel. It was for this he had to leave Germany,
and it was this, in addition to the wild life he had
led. that induced the poor fraction's friends to
insist on her giving up this wayward young man.
Yet she held on, until he wrote saying that it
would be Impossible for him to return to Germany
under six years. Then the woman spoke out:
“When vou come back you will be just in the
prime of your years, but I, on the other side, will
have lost the bloom of youth. I am a woman. If
you could have come back in one or two years, as
you at the time promised me, I would have wlth-
stood all their threats, but the last hope is gone.
. . . Why did you teach me the highest felicity
in the world, only now to let me sink into misery?
. You were my first young love, and ever
will remain so, because I beiong to those natures
that only can love once.” And now, you epicene
moralists through whose sluggish veins a woman’s
kiss has never hastened the blood, don’t you think
after all that the little bottle ef morphine was as
good a way as any to meet the double lose of
country and cara sposaf
Judging from the facts disclosed at a
recent trial, the town of Flatbuah, near New York,
must be a rather rouseabout sort of place to live
in. According to the evidence given, it appears
that what is called a “ church social ’’ was held at
the local Methodist Church, and as things were
going slow, some of the skittish young people
proposed to have a game of mock marriages.
Accordingly, quite a number of giddy couples
were married ; squeezing and “promiscus” oscu-
lation became the order of the day, and In some
oases stretched pretty far Into the night time also.
A few weeks after this, one Miss Annie Higby,
aged 18, happened to visit a lady friend who had
just been married in reality, and, as a matter of
course, the bulk of the chat was all about the
recent nuptials and their gay surroundings. That
night it struck Miss Higby that the different items
on the programme of a mock marriage were pre-
cisely the same as those connected with the real
article Itself, and so firm a grasp did this idea catch
on to the gentle Annie’s mind that she at once
“took the law” on Walter Vaughan, the young
man to whom she was so enthusiastically mock-
married to at that frisky old Methody “church
social.” The suit was contested, and it then leaked
out that the ways of th® people of Flatbush are,
to say the least, peculiar, Amongst other items
too numerous to mention here, the young Flat-
bushers are in the habit of meeting at their various
houses, where they spend the evenings lying in
hammocks together, clasping and kissing each
other continuously. We don’t wonder Miss Higby
considered she had a perfect right to be called Mrs.
Walter Vaughan, after that lot. All that stiffens
us is to know upon what grounds the “honorable
bbt not learned ” Judge dismissed the case and de-
clared there was nothing wrong about Annie’s
trouble whatever, as the whole concern was
simply a little Innocent amusement. In which she
had quite as big a say as Walter. Flatbush Fro-
liques ought to take well in this climate, and
Methody meenisters with a big debt on their
Joss-houses would do well to start a “ church
social.”

The Reporter's Bat-trap.
“Can you tell me,” inquired the woman
with a oast in her left eyo, and a wart on the side
of her nose, “ can you tell me the beat way to
oatch rats?” “Certainly Madame,” replied the
reporter, who was fond of his landlady notwith-
standing her defective appearance, and was glad
of an opportunity to do her a favour; “I can tell
you the best way out to catch rats and mice, but
don’t you give it away, for it's an invention of my
own, and I want to get it patented. In the first
place, you want to got a few pounds of pulverized
plaster of paris. Place this in a dry dish with a
row rim, and stir into it some grated cheese rind
and a little sugar to sweeten it and make it pala-
table. Put this down in the cellar where the rats
o in get at it handy-like, and beside it sot another
dish containing water. Presently you’ll sec an old j
rat come out of his hole, smell abound till he
finds the dish and then begin to ca4. About the
second mouthful be swallows he'll begin to think
that that stuff is the best he’s ever tasted; and he'll
«■ orge himself, you can bet. Every once in a while
he'll turn to the water-dish and take a drink.
When he’s had enough, he'll proceed to take a little
viost-prand'al exercise, while his comrades, who
have scented the dainty dish at last, are helping
themselves. Before very long that plaster of Paris
will begin to dry and get hard. Mr. Bat will notice
a queer sensation at first, and then, all at once,
he’ll be taken with the awfulest stomach-ache that
a rat ever knew. He’ll scratch his ribs first with
one hind paw and then with another, but that
won’t help him. As the stuff inside him grows
harder he’ll lay down, roll over, kick up his
heels, switch his tali and squeal. By this
time the other rats have finished their meal,
and they gather around their unfortunate comrade
to offer consolation. But their efforts are vain,
and the first thing they learn is the discovery that
the malady is catching. One after fnother they’ll
follow the first one's example, until half an hour
later they’ll all be stretched out stiff and hard as
an Italian vendor's images. Then all you’ve got
to do is to go into the cellar with a club; give each
one a blow, and he’ll fly into forty pieces. See ?”
The landlady thought she saw, for she said: “ Why,
how simple and easy it is! I’ll go and try it at
once ’’—and then the reporter retired into the soli-
tude of his own chamber to conceal his emotion.
Catagorical Catastrophe.
There is a man over in America who has
Invented a! machine which he calls the “audi-
phone.” The object of this invention which, by
the way, is too intricate for a minute description,
especially when one has never seen it, is to give its
possessor the exact location of any sound that may
be heard in his neighbourhood. In Woolloomooloo
there resides a young man whose fertility of brain
has long rendered him an object of admiration
amongst a large circle of friends. He lives at a
nice boarding-house, and draws salary enough to
make any young man happy ; but for months
his soul has been troubled and his slumbers
disturbed by a congregation of cats, which were in
the habit of perching on the back fence and wail-
ing forth the fcautata of “Queen Esther” almost
under his very window. In vain did he hurl
water-jugs, old boots, chunks of coal, soap-dishes,
and tumblers out of that window at those pesti-
ferous oats. The concert went right along as
though nothing had happened, and had » run of
365 nights in the year. In sheer desperation, after
emptying his room of everything in the way of a
missile it contained, the young man has more than
once been known to kneel down by his bedside and
say the Lord’s Prayer backwards for the repose of
those felines’ souls. They didn’t repose worth a
copper, however, and then, in the agony of de-
spair, his troubled spirit went forth to the
nearest pub., and drowned its sorrows in the
flowing bowl. One day he read an item
which described the audiphone and explained its
functions and design, A bright idea flashed I
throug:h his brain, and straightway he sent off an
order for one of those machines. It arrived a few
days ago, and was clandestinely conveyed to his
room. Night came on, slowly and gently, like the
fuzz on a seventeen-year-old upper lip. With the
darkness came the cats, and their preliminary
“ mews ” was like the tuning of diseased orchestra
fiddles. “Ah,” said the young man to himself,
“the hour of my triumph has come at last. Now
shall my soul be satiated with revenge, and the
back yard be strewn with the bones of mine
enemies.” Then he loaded up his double-barrelled
shotgun, adjusted the audiphone, and waited for
the concert to begin. Presently the stage manager
arrived and the music was in full olast. The night
was inky black, but the audiphone proved an unerr-
ing guide. After a little experimenting, the young
man got the right range and proper elevation on
the soprano, cocked both barrels, and then let them
go together. There was one wild discordant shriek,
heard high above the thunder of the gun, as the
bones and flesh and hair of that cat parted com-
pany for ever. But the concert went on. A sub-
stitute was obtained from amongst the chorus,
the manager apologised for the interruption, and
begged the Indulgence of the audience for any
shortcomings that might be noticeable in the
scarcely-prepared soprano. Esther stopped to the
front, and began to tell how she was just about to
go into the cellar and see if the king or the cook
had left any cold meat within reach. Several of
her maids gathered about her and told her to
“brace up” and go right in, when “bang” went
the gun again, and the air was filled with the smoke
of battle and the fragments of a dozen high-
class performers. The manager began to get
rilod about this time and called a council of war.
The prompter proposed that the concert be indefi-
nitely postponed, but the chorus wouldn’t hear of
this for a second. Tabby said she could take the
part of Queen quite as well as Esther had done.
And Thomas declared himself quite ready to per-
sonate the character of Haaman. While they were
thus engaged in angry dispute, there came another
flash and a roar like the boom of a cannon; but
high above the din of battle there rose a wild,
concrete yell of agony that made the neighbours
think the lid of perdition had be«n lifted for a
moment. The concert was over. The young man
rang down the curtain of his window, breathed a
prayer for Yankee ingenuity, and slid into bed.
In the morning when he looked out, the back
yard resembled the private dissecting-room of a
sausage factory. Claws, hair, teeth, and bones lay
about in the greate t profusion; but, since that
eventful night, so fraught with catastrophy, the
young man’s slumbers have been undisturbed,
and the categorical cantata is hushed for ever.
Blayney is a rising township situated on
the Bellubula River, bounded on the north by the
Barrier Range, on the South by the Antarctic
Ocean, on the west by the Canobolas, and on the
east by a dead cow. Why we are so particular in
describing the exact locality of this Blayney to-
day is because the following incident didn’t happen
there at all. It eventuated in quite another
Blayney altogether—one way up in the China Sea
somewhei’e. The occasion was the banquet given
in connection with the Blayney Agricultural
Society’s last show meeting, and, when the speechi-
fying was in full blast, one of the rural magnates
—we fancy his name was Smith-having floundered
through a speech written for him by the local
schoolmaster the day before, concluded by laying
his ’and ©n his ’art and exclaiming, “Now, gendel-
inen, I calls upon yer all t’ drink success to the
Pastorial Interests hof th’ Blayney district.” Just
before the hip-hips could be given, however, the
funny man of the town rose and said: “ Gentle-
men. Before drinking the toast so ably proposed
by our friend Mr. Smith, I beg to request that he
will also couple the Pastorial Interests of the
Blayney district with the Minerial Interests of the
mountaynious regions of this glorious subter-
ranean archipelago to which we all belong.”
“’Ear.l’ear,” shouted Muster Smith, “them’s my
sediments to a a T. Now, boys, wid a hip, hip, hip,
hooroar!”
Our Western people are liable to be laid
low, by malarial fsver, when breaking up new
lands. The folks in the East are also complaining
of fevers, chills, and agues, arising from decaying
vegetable matter and imperfect drainage. For
either East or West the best remedy is Ayer's
Ague Cure.
There’s serious domestic trouble at Hobart.
There’s quite a small squadron of warships in port,
and the amorous servant-girls have, It is said,
deserted tkeir posts almost en masse to revel in the
tender attentions of the blue-jackets. A blue-
jaeket’s life in Hobart is just heaven with the
latest improvements. And, by the way, it’s not
only the “slaveys” who idolise them. We re-
member—but we dare not write all our memories
of Sandy Bay and Kangaroo Point beaches. One
thing we will whisper: A certain strict guber-
natorial dame found it her duty to debar sundry
fair lasses of the hmut-ton from her receptions,
owing to little amorous scenes that came to light
at a ball at which the naval heroes were the cham-
pion “mashers.” Oh, and wo recollect this
occurred just when Venus was in transit up
above, so it was only natural she desired to play a
prank or two below.
A Melbourne gentleman, and a poet, is
supposed to have committed suicide. We’re
always sorry when poets commit suicide—we miss
’em so much; but we specially grieve for this par-
ticular bard, because he is described as having
been “respectably connected,” and very few are
like that. Well, this gentleman—Mr. K. S. Gre-
gory—seems to have taken a boat from St. Kilda,
and, when he got out into the bay. to have got
out of the boat and sought a poet’s death. [We
always prefer to disnose of them by drowning, if
possib e.— Ed B ] Mr. Gregory, though, left a few
of his ideas behind him in a letter found at the
bottom of the boat:—“The finder of this letter
will know that 1 am no longer a sojourner on the
face of this horrible earth. It is too much for me,
so I give in. If there is such a place as hell it
can’t be worse than this. I hope God and my
family will forgive mo for taking my own life and
bringing disgrace on them. It is not my fault, for
I am driven to it—too many land-sharks about.
They say I am mad—well, perhaps I am.” There’s
a little more of it, and then comes some poetry in
a postscript
“ I’m not afraid—I do not think I am;
I’ll lace my death—at least, they shall not stay
me;
And yet 1 wonder if I shall be calm,
Leaving my life, love, and friends behind me ?
“ To-morrow I am nothing, and thereafter
Each day will dry a tear, if any sorrow
To me ’twill be the same—their grief or laughter-
just 23, and to die to-morrow.”
We certainly don’t think that Mr. G. was justified
in regarding himself as mad ! Perhaps he was
rather rough on Melbourne in thinking that “hell
can’t be worse,” but there was nothing insane
about the conclusion that there are “too many
land-sharks about.” Besides, no man could turn
out such verses—or any verses, for the matter of
that—unless he was possessed of a robust intellect.
Under the sad circumstances of the case, we feel
constrained to drop into poetry ourselves, as an
epitaph—
We’re much afraid you loft that little bark
To meet a fate undreamed of, and unpleasant,
And fall a victim to some ocean-shark—
Their greed, like that of land ’uns, is incessant.
VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Duke.
The gold-digger's shaft was short, narrow, and
deep.
The ground just above it was abrupt and steep;
And close alongside, running down the incline.
The fence of the paddock looked out on the
mine;
But down in the deep shaft lay, covered with
steam,
The very best bullock Bob had in his team.
The farmer came down with dismay in his look,
And said that he thought 'twas a case with the
Duke.
What made the thing look more discouraging
still,
The head of the Duke was found facing up-hill.
The diggings were old, and the diggers but few,
Yet came up like men to see what they could do.
hhe job was a tough one-they’Il try and they'll
dare;
’Tis not in a digger to ever despair.
They whistled and oooe’d, and word went around,
And soon a good muster was got on the ground—
Ail neighbours and mates, too, a jolly old crew,
Some digging away since the year ’53
The “ Buck ” and the “ Boatman " and “ Bos’n ”
were there,
And “ Harry the German,” and “ Sandy the Bear,”
Old “ Rapsey ” and “ Ruggy,” and “ Major ”
M‘Can,
Three untitled brothers—John, Robert, and Dan;
The “ Hawk,” and the “Nugget,” and “ Tommy
the Frog,”
The “Judge,” and the “Jackass,” the “Parson,”
and “flog”—
Up here on the diggings, one’s falling or fame
Is sure, in the long run, to get him a name.
They set to, to work, and they worked with a
will,
And cut a deep trench from the shaft up the hill;
They worked and they toiled, and, relieving each
shift,
They tried by all means to diminish the lift.
Out spoke the old “ Bos’n his accents were
rough—
“ I think, my good fellows, we’ve sunk deep
enough;
This noose round the butt of his horns you just
pass,
And with a good pull we may bring him to grass.”
They let down the “ Prog,” with the rope round
him cast,
And, after some failures, the noose was made
fast.
“ Now, ready, my boys, like one man,” said the
“ Judge.”
They pulled and they tugged, but with never a
“ budge;”
They pulled up again—to the “Bos’n’s” strong
word—
Position the same: the poor Duke never stirred.
“ I think,” said the “ Parson,” “I do, ’ponmy soul,
That bullock will never come out of the hole.”
“ Come on,” said old Bob; “to the shade, my boys,
come.
And help yourselves here to a drop of good rum.
The day is exceedingly sultry and warm,
And, hark! in the west is the voice of the storm;
I thank you all, boys, but I fear ’tis In vain
To hope for the Duke to be got out again.”
They stood up again, saying “ Come, lads, be-
fore
The storm comes on we shall try it once more.”
Grandfather came up from the digging, and said,
“ Good daughter-in-law, put your hat on your
head;
Yourself and the girls here should go down and
look
At all that is doing to get out the Duke,
Your sewing in hand—though the heat is Intense,
You may look for awhile o’er the rails of that
fence.”
Two beautiful girls with their mother came
down,
The best and the fairest in that little town.
When first they were sighted descending the
green,
A magical change was observed in the scene;—
The “Major” here spoke out in commanding
word,
“ To get him up this way, the thing is absurd;
If we are determined the bullock to save,
A g*od Spanisi windlass’g the thing we must
have.”
“You just spoke before me,” the old “Bos’n”
said ;
“ I wonder what kept it so out of my head.”
The untitled brothers, John, Robert and Dan,
Pronounced it the only—the very best plan.
Each man had his say—even old fellows took
A different view of the fate of the Duke.
Ward Brown of his powers left no one in doubt;
The chips from his axe like great pancakes flew
out.
The trees were soon down, and the windlass was
made,
Secure on the shaft it was carefully laid.
Ere all things be ready, there still must be placed
A sort of a band round the animal’s waist.
The “ Bos’n ” with ropes made a very fair band
(In anything ropey, a very good hand);
He went down the shaft, and, ’tis said by a fluke,
He got his rope girt round the ribs of the Duke.
And when he arrived at the top of the shaft.
His mates cried out “Bravo!”—the young ladies
laughed.
The? hauled up the Duke, and they set him quite
free,
To roam for a while o'er the mountain and lea.
But, mark what he did—just to show his good
sense,
He tossed the old “ Bos’n ” right over tho fence;
The rest, when they saw him prepare to give
chase,
Flew over the fence to get clear of His Grace!
Some called into “ Barrel’s ” to have a full glass,
A read of the paper, and let the rain pass.
Next morning, when “Barrel” first opened the
, door,
He found half-a-dozen stretched out on the floor,
And saw in the rut, from the place where he
stood,
“ Judge,” “ Parson,” and “ Rapsey ” asleep in the
mud.
The years, like the waves of the ocean, roll on.
And many of these men are now dead and gone;
Yet, some still dream on, as fond mem Tv presents
The beautiful forms that stood by the fence I
Bus In Urbe.
He came to town from Bilbarook—
Tall, boney, young-, and callow;
High hat: hair cut with reaping-hook;
Shirt crimson, necktie yellow.
Across his arm he slung his coat,
And lounged along the Block,
And oft paused on his way to note
And time the Town Hall clock.
He heard the flippant quack explain,
But was not “taken in;”
Aspasia spread her nets in vain—
He knew the snares of sin.
For often round the glowing Are
The Nestor of the shed
Had told to wond’ring ears the dire
Deceits they had to dread.
He carre to see the Cup race run—
To share a sweep he stood—
Although he cared not much what won—
That’s if the sport was good;
He’d show his colours on the Flat,
Or maybe on the Hill;
He’d throw a shilling in the hat,
And try his shooting skill.
He tramped his passage to the course,
And, itching to begin.
He put some money on a horse—
The horse that didn’t win;
He uttered many a dry remark.
Bran-new upon the station,
Nor knew that Noah of the Ark
Cursed Ham for their creation.
He met another country lad.
Way down from Jamberoo —
A soft and simple youth, who had
Come for the races, too.
On rustic themes their views they blent.
And Joined to curse the weather,
And then meandered to the tent
To hav-s a drink together.
And while they quaffed their “ native ” beer,
Their wandering glances light
On sleepy eyes, and stupid leer—
A sharper “on the tight.’’
Their rustic hearts beat fast in glee;
Their hopes, their bright looks tell;
Tail yarns loom in their minds—” How we
Once had a city * swell.' ”
He showed the youths a handsome case,
A present from his girl;
Her “phiz ’’ within—a wondrous face,
With frill and fringe and curl.
He closed it; and, in maudlin tone
That told his sotted brain,
He challenged all who heard, that none
Could show the face again.
The man from Jamberoo bad learned
The casket’s simple trick,
And whilst the magsman’s head was turned,
He worked it—with a click;
Then ventured, with his rustic friend.
Two fivers to a ten,
That, ere the quarter chime would end,
He d show the face again.
The box is closed; the wager laid;
The yokels turn and twist,
Their visions with the minutes fade,
The mystic springs resist.
The quarter chimes; the rustics pay
The premium for their folly;
The sharper goes his happy way—
No longer drunk, but “ jolly.”
But friends must part, with fond adieu
And mutual sympathising;
Gone is the lad from Jamberoo,
The other ?—moralising.
In town, next day. he met the twain
Consulting o’er their “ boob,”
He left—to catch an early train,
And start for Bilbarook.

Matrimony.
It has been our little weakness to marry
so frequently of into that, notwithstanding' in our
most recent experience of it having come down
rapidly from the mandolin to the American axe
we have more than a passing Interest in this hon-
ourable phase of human joinery. It is, therefore,
with some glee that wo welcome two matrimonial
Journals—one Matrimony, published (its third
issue) in Sydney, and the other L’Alliance des
Familles, an old-established paper issued in Paris.
Matrimony is conducted, it seems, by a foreign
gentleman, whom we have not had the pleasure of
coming across before, either in the field of letters or
where you get three courses and a broth bath for
a bender. ’ That, however, is doubtless our Joss.
Anyway, here is now the Signor as large as life,
answering correspondents i n a weeplngly sarcastic
manner which must exercise, wo should say, in no
lightdegree our candidates for connubiality. For
nstance, to “Christian” the Signor says:—“The
photo, we have received was submitted to our
readerof character- [The paper Is published under
the auspices of the Phrenological Society of New
South Wales, whatever that !<.—Ed. B.]—and he
has named her Miss Sickly Sentimentalism, simper-
ing along through life, whimpering over silly
novels. She loves and adores. Perhaps you may
love her, but we don’t.” . . . Think of that!
To “H.J.B.” ho says with dignity, “Philosophy
cheers our brightest moments - religion our dark-
est;” this being the first Instance of our being
apprised that “ our brightest moments ” wanted
cheering I But, doubtless, the Professor is of a
more profound temperament than we are. Let
there be always something cold in the safe and a
□ot absolutely brutal publican at the corner, and I
we can laugh even at comic open. Poor“A.B.”
drops In for a terrible dose, yet it Is hard to see
what he has done to deserve it. But it taken a genius
to find out these things. However, read;—“The
organ of approbativeness and sell-esteem is situ-
ated at the crown of the head, and from the ap-
pearance of your person you have an abundance
of It, amounting almost to vanity and conceit ”
We shouldn’t te surprised, after this, if “A.B”
called round to pay his subscription with a box-
iron. One writer ausweis “tome one to love,”
and states that he is “middie-aged, iu tollerably
(sic) good position ” [remember our little bracketed
note above], and If “the advertiser thinks she
comes up to his st tndard, and that she does not
pin her faith to D.-. Simms with regard to the
shape of nose and features, a letter addressed,” etc.
There can be no doubt, of course, as to the sterling
genuineness of that communication; no doubt
i whatever. [Pass the cough-lozenges; we have a
tickling- in our throat.— Ed. B.] “ Q. S.W.” will
“ pay handsomely ’’ lor an introduction to a young
lady with a “fondness for mu«ic" (we wonder
whether ho means lhe concertina 1) ; and “Rocks
and Bricks’* rcquiro-modesty is evidently their
failing I-“ two prepossessing ladies of 17 and 20
[Not two each, we hope.— Ed. B.], with fair hair
and dark complexions.” “ George,” who is “ cheer-
ful,” will “settle his wife’s money on herself;”
and Lucy, considerably good-looking, wants a
tali, sandy-oomplexioned gentleman, inclined to a
Soman or long nose.” “Allegro” - but read it; it
s the gem of the lot: “ 1 Allegro ’ wants to meet a
ady with a little mea-s, so as to help him on in bis
•rofession. A phrenologist told him that ho will
bine in the Held of letters. He has some means,
>ut cannot keep up the appearance of a profes-
mnal. Will bo rich some day, being of a good
amily.” We think tbisgentlemanisalittlo vague;
or it seems to us that if his “profession” be the
Held of letters,” the only thing he is likely to
bine with is yellow soap. And why, if aspiring to
le Held of letters, should he wish to “keep up
ie appearance of a professional ?” Does this
eluded young man think labourers in the literary
eld go about with a shiny hat over one eye, a
rass pin in a dirty green tie, a velvet collar orna-
mented with hair-oil. and a quarto note-book with
an 18-inch pencil ? Does ho imagine that those
choice “wall-flowers” who are perpetually polish-
ing the Theatre Royal premises (outside), sucking-
short ends of doubtful cigars, are labouring
under the delusion that people can't see
that they have inked their cloudy socks to hide
paloable holes in their “property” shoes; can
Allegro ” think these scarecrows are editors and
dramatic critics? Of course, he thinks so, poor
youth; and how many more persons of a similar
Intellectual calibre have been under precisely the
same delusion! Having given the Signor a very
fine show, let us do our little best to send the
Almance des Famines along. In this publica-
tion. as is not uncommon with journals printed in
Paris, the contents are in the French tongue; it
will, therefore, be necessary to translate a lew of
the “ demaride* et off re* de mariaoe a travail,
w hich, with the aid of a member of the German
| band, we daresay we shall be able to successfully
accomplish. In connection with this office, though,
I we will first tell you a little story. Once an elderly
wi 'ow advertised for a husband, and some young
fellows answering it, sent her the photo, of an
ourang-outang. The editor, hearing t his, was ex-
ceedingly angry, and immediately wrote to the
lady, apologising. Before, however, he could post
his apologetic missive, be received from the widow
the following reply:—“ Sir, I accept the husband
you offer me, with pleasure. He has a very
distinguished air.” L’Alpiance, then, has ove
sixteen columns of closely - printed advertise
ments; and an extraordinary feature in these
announcements is that all the advertisers ap
pear to have cash unlimited. For instance, here
is a widow lady with 300,000 francs (£8000) who
wishes to wed a gentleman of position, and imme-
diately below this wo find “ une demoiselle in-
struite ” advertised for by a gentleman possessing
‘‘a fortune of one million francs.”! Wo will give
you the next one side by sido with the French
original. Wo fear (though such a thing has never
occurred, to our knowledge, since we commenced
to impart instruction to humanity) you should
doubt the authenticity of what we serve up to
you
“Demoiselle noble, 33 “ A young lady of title,

Then one with 150,000 francs wishes to wed a bar-
rister: another, with 70,000 fr., a splendid trousseau,
and good expectations, is desirous of being linked
with a head clerk. The ladies advertise with great
energy through six or seven pages for lieutenants,
captains, engineers, architects, publicans, even for
workmen; but there is not one siuyle demand for a
.journalist! This ought to be a crusher for the
young man who wishes to “shine In the world of
letters” and “keep up the appearance of a pro-
fessional I ” What a show he has of finding a lady
with a little means who will help him along In his
business! So far as we are concerned, we bear
calmly this neglect of the noble guild —we quote
an Evknino News man—of letters. We remember
that we are married; and a robust voice has just
also recalled to our recollection that there is some-
thing wrong with the pump.

Rev. Father Wilds’
EXPERIENCE.
The Rev. Z. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary In New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of the
Massachusetts Supremo Court, writes
as follows:
“78 E. 54th St., New York, May 16,1882.
Messrs. J. C. Ayer & Co.. Gentlemen :
Last winter I was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor affecting
more especially my limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that 1 could scarcely bear any clothing
over them. I was also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and my system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first (lose. After
a short time the fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
were also cured by the same means, ami
my general health greatly improved, until
it is now excellent. I feel a hundred per-
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all conlldence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. I took
it in small doses three times a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles. 1 place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may do good.
Yours respectfully, Z. P, Wilds.”
The above instance is but one of the many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from impure or impoverished blood, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of the stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Scrof u-
lous Diseases, Eruptions of the Skin, Jlheu-
matism , Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of the system.

BOUTS WITH THE
BAILIFFS.
E has been in two days
and as he stretches out
there, with dusty feet on
a pillow, aud dr earns the
happy hours
away, we
peruse agiiii
his written authority for taking up lodgings under
our roof tree. From that document wo learn that
a “judgment ’ was obtained! igaii.st us for so much;
and that, as we had failed to divert that amount ol
currency from its n Rural purpose of supplying
bread —and as, moreover, the days are gone by
when decapitation paid all bills, a “ warrant ol
execution ” is Issued against our goods and we are
consequently looking up the produce reports in
order to ascertain how straw is quoted, in \ iew of
an early adoption of that breezv stylo of repose
recommended by the great, financial and sanitary
reformer, Marjorv Daw. Further on, we gather
that if the whole amount (it s only about seven
years’ earnings) be paid within one hour of the
gorgon’s entry, everything will work sweet. But,
as forty-eight houis have already elapsed, and
uncle Mo. is full up of our accounts, we have made
no sign. It is therefore, a foregone thing that in
three days’ time there will be a rare opportunity
for parties about to furnish—the whole of the
elegant furniture, pianos, clocks, &c., selected in
Europe, together with an imported tomahawk
with a loose handle, the whole lot filling one
packing case and a portmanteau, and araoui t-
fng in value to fully fifteen shillings, will
have to go without reserve. In the meantime we
have adopted such little precautions as a some-
what varied experience has taught us. And how
our memory wanders back to the days when
irruptions such as this were mot with considerable
agitation, not to say worry! When we had given
our nights and days to Addison for purity of style,
and to the reports of Parkes’s speeches for a final
polish and moral tone, prior to launching out into
the glorious and lucrative career of letters, we
were not cool. We disliked the practice of tho
women along the terrace leaning on their brooms
at the door, and sending around their children to
watch the loading of the van, and take stock of
the pattern of the carpet and the number of flat-
irons. We used to swear, and getaway. Those
were in the old days, and before we had begun to
look upon the bailiff as the heaven - ordained
adjunct to a literary career, and his work as the
crowning glory of British jurisprudence. The
property of the liteiary man has in all ages been
recognised as the most acceptable and legitimate
sacrifice at the altar of justice, and the profession
of a bailiff as the most honourable open to man.
Property is made to te seized; and if there were
nothing to seize, thousands of honourable gentle-
men would be cast upon the cold world, the
march of civilisation be retarded, and the intellect
of the man of letters would stagnate for want of
wholesome change. But, as we said, these things
only dawn on a man after many years’ experience.
We should say that at least two dozen seizures
have to be gone through before one’s estimate of
this business, and knowledge of how to treat its
officers with due deference, mature; and, as many
literary men, and t-uccessful ones, too, have been
known to go months and months together without
entertaining one of these angels, it is not to bo
wondered at that their posthumous letters some-
times betray an amount of agitation over such
affairs, that, to say the least of It, looks like repin-
ing against the decrees of Heaven. Seizable pro-
perty could not exist without a teizer, and to rail
at the process is to run amuck at the very founda-
tion of property, and to prevent accumulation—
the worst form of communism.
♦ * *
Many are the devices of the amateur
seizee. One gentleman ot our acqu ilntance has
followed with unbroken success tho practice of
loading up at night, lending this load of household
gods to a friend, and coming around to stay with
us when our man is not “in.” It is a cheerful
spectacle when this adept taps at the door and
comes upstairs Wo remember one particular
occasion. We were at breakfast, and hourly ex-
pecting seizure. The children were well up to
their work and at the first tap the whole five rose,
and pocketed their spoons. Then each “ planted ”
a tin-plate under a brick in the fire-place, and
walked off to school humming “There s no place
like home.” Wo openel the door. Macaulay said
“Open wider, and take in real estate, land in fee,
and in reveision. Prepare for prospective profits,
and realised wealth : and get ready a bit of some-
thing to eat while I fritter away broad acres.” It
was then that we noticed his bulk. In times of
ordinary prosperity, and when his chest is not in-
flated with the burning sentiments of an ode for
next week’s Town and Country Journal, he is
slender built, and, like the rest of that staff, with
legs that might bo worked off in a job lot of pick-
handles. But now he could have given John
Lucas twelve inches, and sent every button of bis
waistcoat, flying. ‘’Yes,” he said, pulling off two
overcoats, three coats, four vests, three pairs of
trousers, six shirts, aud emptying out of his hat
live collars, three pairs of socks, a comb, and
a Mackinnon pencil, “ I thought I would
leave over there, and shift into more com-
modious quarters. You see, there was some
little difficulty about getting out my port-
manteau, so I thought 1 would just wear away
my property. I shall have to call over three or
four times again to-day, as there are some boots
and slippers I shall want.” He then sat down and
asked our opinion of the last line of his new ode,
and forgot all about breakfast.
• ♦ *
Another has discovered that a good
bottle of whisky judiciously administered
in a public-house handy, will cause a stern
bailiff to lose his way back for tho night;
■whilst a third relies on treating him hospitably,
and then flavouring his tea so peculiarly that he
requires to go to the hospital. But all these de-
vices fade beside the masterly one of having no-
thing—a style of living for which the Income and
tastes of the literary man are peculiarly suited. It
is a known fact that pleasant surroundings, pic-
tures, music, an'* comfortable sofas, have a ten-
dency to repress the noble rage of the soul, and to
enfeeble tho understanding, fn this view it is a
great tribute to the intellectual vigour ot George
Eliot, Swinburne, and other wealthy writers to
state that they wore able, in spite of these draw-
backs, to produce the worirs they have. For our
parr, we find our highest flights when we sit
down on tho floor and transfer to paper,
spread on a gin - case, the thoughts that
breathe and words that burn. When the
stomach is not burdened with tho dainties of the
pampered rich, but just lightly and commodiously
nourished once a day from tho groaning boards of
a sixpenny eating-house, then genius expands her
rainbow wings, and catches the sheen ot the upper
skies-scattering her golden rays ail adown tho
empyrean - gladdening stars and revivifying a
moribund humanity. Then the clear brain shivers
with the divine tones of poesy, the dishevelled
threads of subtle speculation warp and woof them-
relves into a handsome method ; scattered con-
jectures unite into a symmetrical whole, i-.nd
poetry, metaphysics, and paragraphs gush forth
with the point, t lie elegance, and the incisiveness
of a M'Elhonian estimate of the Government.
And. (hen, the surround ings. When the caudU sticks
have gone with tho rest,! when tho wood-heap can
no longer bo kept in countenance with the loose
palings of your neighbour’s fence, and you wash
your face at the tap and wipe it on your sleeve,
and scrape your bald spot with a three-tooth
comb, and the milkman calls next door, and the
butcher and grocer meditate about sending sup-
plies, and decide not to—then is the time to pile
up an extra wad of straw at your back, and to
lie down with a wisp in your ear and a handful in
the small of your back, and give way to profitable
meditation. It is then that the true man of letters
knows that this is the best of all possible worlds.
He secs maras of design in the mosquitos that
blacken his tossing children, and adaptation in
every knot and carpet tack that binds him to
earth. He has consolation in the thought that his
neighbours sleep well, and have corn and wine in
ample store. Oh, yes. When the bailiff has come
and gone, and all the enfeebling surroundings of
chair and mirror and table and crockery have
vanished, then is the time to stick your candle in
your blucher, and roll out the side-splitting joke,
the pointed epigram, and the polished stanza. How
else did we produce our Immortal “ Considerations

trill off the first three cautos of tne “ Lay of the
Lily ?” In what walk of life is the art acquired so
early and thoroughly of wearing the boot all down
at the heel to k- ep the toe from going ? Where

infrequent German sausage, or the unforseen
counter lunch that nourishes and inspires ?

THE BALLAD OF THE BAILIFF
Oh a merry life has a bailiff bold,
No care nor toil has he;
He thrusts the widow out in the cold
And warms his toes while the bed is sold
Then travels right merrilie.
He merrily travels away, my boys,
And cares not, he, a pin ;
For a woman’s sobs are a cheerful noise,
And a rattling joke the tears of her boys,
That raise but a good old grin.
To-night he rests on a poet’s bed.
Watching the pale-faced bard
Pacing and racking his fevered head
For the rhyme he must wx-ite to bring him bread
“ Oh God, but the wo-ld is hard 1”
And then he sits on the spendthrift’s chair,
Sipping the spendthrift's wine ;
And he leaves his lodgings empty and bare,
And sings in the imdst of tbe deep despair
“ Oh, a merry old life is mine.”
They’ve got a Latin class at Randwiok
now, and Mr. Isaac Samuelson seems to take a
great intert st in it. He walked in, the other day,
musingly, and having tapped a boy on the head
who was choking over an apple, he stood a d
listened. “I suppose you’ve forgotten all your
Latin. Mr. Samuelson, by this time?” said the
teacher, smiling. Then there came a lull. “No,”
replied he, thoughtfully; “I know a bit yet.
What do you call that part that begins with hie?”
he enquired. “ Dcmonstralive pronouns,’’ replied
tha teacher. “ Alt,” rejoined the gnat, man, “ well
1 know some of that. Lot’s see:-' I He hive hoe -
Hujus— Ikk.’ I always remember that,” lie ex-
plained, “because it brings in my own name so
pat. Good mornun.”
HE WOULD DO HIS DUTY.
A PASTORAL PARALTSER.
IN FOUR FYTTES AND AN INTERVAL.
DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
Wholesale Grabber, Esq.—A pastoral lessee on
an extensive scale.
Mr. D. Uty.— A newly-appointed Inspector of
C.P.’s, and who is, as such, most firmly deter-
mined to do his duty.
John Dumbye.— A selector. .
Scene, Sarawak,
fytte i.
W. Grabber (loq.): Good morning, Mr. Uty.
Going far ?
D. Uty: Not very far, Mr. Grabber: only out to
look for a selector named Dumbye, and round
about a bit. You see, I’m a stranger in the dis-
trict, Some of the places are difficult to find, and
I want to do ray duty if possible, you know.
W. Grabber: Oh, of course. Yes; very right,
Dumbye’s, eh ? Oh, well, s’pose I may as well ride
along with you and show you a bit ef the country.
fytte ii.
W. Grabber ( pointing to hut in the instance):
There, that's Dumbye’s place ; but you needn’t
bother yourself about him. He’s one of “ our's,”
you know. Good man, Dumbye. Very old ser-
vant. Turned him out there with the run of his
teeth, you see. Ha! ha! ha! He’sall right enough.
Come along, though, and I'll show you a fellow
who’s a confounded nuisance, and who hasn't been
on his ground for a twelve-mouth.
D. Uty : Eh ? What I What, d’ve moan, Mr.
Grabber? (Pulls out memorandum). Yes, here it
is, right enough—J. Dumbye, 640 a C.P., parish of
Sarawak.
W. Grabber (aside): What a d—d ass! (Aloud):
Oh, that’s square enough, of course; and old Tip-
taker’s passed it half-a-dozen times before you
came. Oh, well; of course, if you must see the
man, you must!
fytte iit,
D. Uty (loq ): Mr. Dumbye, I presume ?
Dumbye: That's mo.
D. Uty: Areyou the bona fide owner of this pro-
perty standing in your name ?'
Dumbye (hcsita'ingly, and looking at Grabber):
Well, s pose so. But you ain’t Mr. Tiptaker ?
D. Uty doq): Never mind who I am. Is this land
yours ? W hy, the hut’s empty and the tank’s dry!
How and where do you get your living ?
Dumbye ( doggedlu ): Look here, you want to
know too much! Better ask the boss there (point-
ing to Grabber).
W. Grabber : Come, come, Mr. Uty; that’s
enough, surely. Can’t you see with half an eye
which way the wind blows ? Why, you’re a regu-
lar new-chum! You’ve done all you re paid for
doing now. Come along.
D. Uty (stiffly): Mr. Grabber, I believe I shall be
but doing my duty bv moving for an inquiry into
this conditional purchase I think it looks most
suspicious. And you yourself admitted, a short
time ago, that the holder was one of your own
employes. I must do my duty, sir.
W. Grabber: Never said such a thing, I can
assure you.
D. Uty: And I say you did, sir. (Exchange mu-
tual compliments, and exeunt).
FYTTE IV,
“ To the Hon. the Minister for Plantations. Borneo.
“ Dear Peter,—Things, I see, are looking rather
shady for your side just at present, and the general
opinion seems to be that before lorg you’ll all
have to ‘face tho country’ again. By the way,
how did that ass of an Inspector of C.P.’s come to
be sent up here—D. Uty, I mean ? He’s kicking up
a fine shine. Says he must do his duty. Prepos-
terous, that, you know. Got dummyism on the
brain, I think. Couldn’t you manage to sack him
or shift him somewhere out of the road, and send
old Tiptaker back again ? Everybody is complain-
ing. Try, and oblige
“ Yours most sincerely,
“ Wholesale Grabber.
“P.S.-Should things come to a push with you, and
v u should have to come up here, I think 1 may
ay my people are good for fifty votes at the least,
l the right side.—W.G.”
AN INTERVAL.
Wholesale Grabber (reading Government
azette! : “ C. M. G. Tiptaker to be Inspector of
' ndltional Purchases, Sarawak District, vice D
Utv, transferred to Fly River District, N G.’
4.loud): Ah! He would do hisdKty, would he?
“WALKED OFF BUMMING ‘THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE HOME.’”
“ Isn’t that your son Tirrince, Mrs. MacHalloran ?”
“Whist, it is; but he doesn’t wish me to recognoise him on the sthreet.”
