DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
TUB GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON BARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.
IF YOU ARE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER YOU REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.

“The Drum Ecclesiastic.”
“I march with no party, I march with no flag that does
not keep step with the Union.” Ah, poor Toby, who
would have thought that within a few short months from
the time you gave utterance to these words you would
be marching and keeping step with your present leader
to the beat of the “drum ecclesiastic.”—Sydney Echo,
7th December.
“We are for the ‘ masses,’ ” said a N.S.W’. Government
supporter. “No doubt of it,” retorted a labouring man,
“ that appears to be the ‘cardinal ’ point of your political
creed.”—Sydney Echo, 7th December.
The Jesuit in politics and how he works, the working-
classes will see when their delegates record their votes on
Mr. Reid’s motion. —Echo, 10th December.
“ Patriot ” writes:— On Thursday last the Echo said
“ The Jesuit in politics and how he works, the working-
classes will see when their delegates record their votes on
Mr. Reid’s motion.” The working-men of Sydney now
understand the truth of the prediction.— Echo, 11th
December.
An American Republican is a curious mixture of Radi-
calism and Religious-conservatism who contrives to
reconcile protection and ultramontanism with the
doctrine of dynamite, and, unfortunately, he has many
imitators in Australia.— Echo, 12th December.
“N.S.W.” (an obviously invented correspondent)
writes:—“The Jesuit in politics, and how he works.”
The working-classes have now grasped the situation, and
events show that their grip will be tenacious.— Echo, 15th
December,
The foregoing extracts—a few only out of a very
long series which have appeared in Sydney
Echo —are not “ sentences torn from their
context,” and thereby made to bear a meaning
foreign to that of the writer’s intention ;
they are short, independent articles which
glare out in large type on the most con-
spicuous page of a print published in the
interests of morality, respectability and
Foreign-trade. Ever since the advent of
the Dibbs Ministry in New South Wales, a
certain section of the shoddy press, and
particularly the Echo aforesaid, has wailed
even more drearily than usual on the as-
sumption that Protection is a Popish plot
travelling incognito, and has (as per the items
at the head of this article) done all it could
to arouse the old, brutal, murderous spirit of
sectarian hate throughout the province. The
Echo -it is necessary to explain for the
benefit of all persons not residing at Potts
and Darling Points, Sydney—is the cheap
hanger -on and unconsidered postscript
of the moral Sydney Morning Herald ; it
Sneaks out in the afternoon from the same
bffice, and utters the opinions of the same
wealthy and respectable proprietary. There-
fore, when the Echo waves the gory shirt of
bigotry it thereby waves the Herald’s shirt
at the same time, and flourishes the wild,
red undergarment of the pious house of
Fairfax and its brigade of decayed clergy-
men. If the Fairfaxes do not shriek
in private life to the effect that every man who
wants to promote local industries in New
South Wales is a base and treacherous
Jesuit, and it the Herald, for the sake of
its advertising business, does not howl forth
that the True Faith will go to pot if
M‘Millan’s imported calico industry is
interfered with, they are none the less
responsible ; the whole combination is one
and the same. The Echo, in fact, says for
the Herald all those things which are too
base and too dirty to be said by the fair-
seeming Herald itself. The Herald is
largo, respectable, and profitable, and it has
to deal with all sections of the community ;
therefore it is not to be lightly risked in
any dubious undertakings ; the Echo, if it
lives up to its outward aspect, is not particu-
larly profitable, and can therefore be used
more recklessly. The man who wants to
bite somebody without any loss to himself
naturally sools his cheapest dog after his
enemy, and the principle is safe, though
mean. If the Fairfaxes do not be-
ieve that Protection is a nefarious Popish
device, as they so lavishly insinuate
in the Echo, then they are lying—there
is no other word that expresses the situation.
If they do believe it, and yet allow the evil
to pass without raising the ponderous voice
of the Herald in protest, then they are sel-
fish and cowardly, and are willing to shut
one eye upon a glaring iniquity lest the
heavy respectability of their twopenny organ
should suffer in a good cause. They may
choose between these two alternatives with-
out any extra charge. If the Echo— which
is Fairfax —is lying wilfully and maliciously,
then the Herald —which is also Fairfax—
would lie also if it dared. If the Echo
believes, in its crass ignorance, that it is
telling the truth, then the Herald is equally
ignorant, and is ignominious as well, inas-
much as it has not the courage to tell what it
believes to be the truth.
* * »
No reason has ever been adduced to show
that Catholicism and Protection have, or
ever had, any connection. The bulk of the
Protectionist voters, and nine-tenths of the
Protectionist politicians of New South
Wales, are Protestant, just as the bulk of
the Foreign-trade voters and politicians are
Protestant, for the very good and sufficient
reason that the great mass of the New South
Wales electors are of the Protestant faith.
The statements of the Echo rest on no
foundation save that of hard and con-
tinuous mendacity, and the fact that here
and there some dull and ignorant individual
has been induced to believe them is only an
evidence of what may be accomplished by
bald, naked, and incessant lying. Parkes, till
now the high-priest of Foreign-trade, who, the
other day, in a frenzy of impotent rage, sacri-
legiously spat in the face of his fetish,
sought many years ago to bolster up his
political ascendancy by appealing to the
same base and savage passions to which the
conscienceless Echo proprietary, in their
dire extremity, appeal to-day. When O’Far-
bell, the lunatic, and descendant of a
family of lunatics, attempted to assassinate a
member of the British Royal house, in
Sydney, Parkes, with unspeakable baseness,
strove to fasten that irresponsible maniac’s
crime on a section, if not on the whole, of
the Roman Catholics of the province ; and it
is not too much to say that were the S.M.
Herald proprietary possessed of any real
sense of decency, the mere recollection of
certain circumstances attendant on the mad-
man’s alleged “confession” would be suffi-
cient to make them, and all connected with
their paper, for ever hold their peace on
that or any like subject. The shameless
conspiracy to deprive a guiltless section of a
peaceful community of their civilrights, andto
passuponthemasentenceof political outlawry,
was fully exposed and utterly destroyed in
the N.S.W. Assembly by that gallant
Protestant gentleman, the late Sir Wil-
liam Macleay, and the conspirators by
whom it was concocted were covered with
public shame. Yet to-day, the organ of the
Fairfaxes revives the tactics of the
O’Farrell time, and trusts that the nation—
which has a short memory —may forget how
the old calumny came to grief some 25 years
ago.
# # *
The alleged “Popish conspiracy” which
is discovered by the Echo to-day, and the
alleged “Popish conspiracy” which was dis-
covered by Titus Oates 200 years ago, stand
on exactly the same footing. Oates’ fabri-
cated plot, supported by tremendous men-
dacity and utter callousness, drenched
England with blood and filled the land with
corpses ; the Echo appeals, just as he did,
to the basest, lowest and most brutal passions
of the community, and it only fails—where
its lamented predecessor succeeded—for
want of believers. The crime is exactly the
same ; the only difference is that when the
trains were fired, the one exploded, while
the other fizzled drearily and went out.
# # #
Roman Catholicism is a creed which, like
Protestantism, has its scattered followers
almost everywhere. Therefore, if, as the
Echo asserts, Catholicism and Protection
go together in one province, they must
do so also in all parts of the • earth, for
Catholicism is much the same wherever it goes.
Yet Germany—where two-thirds of the popu-
lation is Protestant—is strongly Protec-
tionist. So is Denmark, where 99 per cent,
of the population belongs to the Reformed
faith ; Holland, where the Catholics number
one in three ; the United States, where they
average only one in eight ; Russia, where
Catholicism is practically a prohibited faith,
and the Greek Church is absolutely supreme;
Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and
Maoriland, in most of which the proportion
of Catholics is even smaller than in New
South Wales, and in most of which,
by the way, the Orange chiefs have
been in the van of the Protectionist
forces. But Fairfax's parochial rag knows
of nothing outside its own infinitesimal
circle, and it is utterly inane and pur-
poseless even within that circle. It asserts
baldly that there is a link between Catholic-
ism and Protection, but what that link may
be it never explains. It never pretends to
define how a Catholic can gain more by any
fiscal creed than a Protestant, or to assert
that the tax-gatherer does not call round on
members of all faiths with equal impartiality.
It lives simply on the bald implication
that God is somehow with the cause
of Foreign-trade, and that the Almighty,
from His throne among the stars, watches
with fatherly solicitude over the bales and
boxes that are humped ashore at Circular
Quay, Sydney, and in its own small, idiotic
way it is well-advised to go no further. It
would be a pity to spoil so vast an assump-
tion by giving reasons.
#‘ # #
And, meanwhile, Foreign - trade goes
steadily to wreck, and the great First Cause
sits unmoved, and makes no sign. The sun
does not stand still for Faibfax, and the
stars roll on, unconscious that a penny paper
is trying to borrow their Creator and use
Him as an instrument to remove the duty
on candles and produce that is put up in
bags. Possibly He takes no interest in
Foreign-trade, and regards it as little as the
Foreign-trader himself does the indignation
of the germ that occupies only the millionth
part of the point of a needle. Possibly the
Deity takes no special interest in Catholicism
and Protestantism; theyarebut two small, un-
considered rows which have only lasted some
few hundred years, in one corner of a tiny
planet, that endured for billions of ages
before either of them was born, and will
last for billions of ages when they are both
dead and forgotten, and which, even in the
immensity of its bulk and its old age, is
only a speck in the glare of a million of suns.
Possibly the Almighty doesn’t even care for
Faibfax, who is only the memory of a
lost nothingness howling on the surface of
that speck, and running a paper there,
just as some other lost animalcule might run
a paper inside Fairfax’s own physical
being, and sell it to other animalcules—in
which case the invisible parasite might also
think, with just as much reason, that the
Lord existed only to prop up its mean little
interests, and that the unseen insect which
didn’t fall in with its views was given over
to the devil. Life is full of strange and
unknown possibilities, and these are only
a few among them all. And meanwhile the
world travels on and on freighted with its
load of destiny, and the small man wlio owns
a small Foreign-trade journal in a small,
unconsidered corner of this smallest of all
earths, tries to borrow the unfathomable
immensity of the Creator to boost up his
own small fad, and never even realises the
hideous grotesqueness of the situation.
* « *
The original naked savage who invented a
hairy devil to account for the thunder, and
the modern Foreign-trader who invents a
devil to account for Protection, stand on
very much the same level. If there is any
difference, the latter is the meaner of the
two, inasmuch as what was ignorance in the
ancient heathen is gross mendacity in his
nineteenth - century successor. For the
alleged Christian who, to serve his own
miserable ends, will define American Re-
publicanism as a mixture of Roman
Catholic fanaticism and dynamite, merely
because the American declines to follow
his fiscal fad, has reached a depth of
brutal intolerance which could give points
even to the Spanish Inquisition. And when
the same bigot tacitly denounces his own
fellow countrymen—simply because they
claim the right of all free men to be guided
by their own intelligence—as dynamiters
(which is only a synonym for midnight
assassins) he falls a shade lower still, and
even the leper might reasonably shun his
society. The Foreign-trade party has played
its game out, and having failed it is ungentle-
manly—to put the matter in the mildest
form—to get level by heaving garbage at the
victors. If the Fairfaxes, proprietors of
the Echo (and also of the S.M. Herald)
ever indulge in any sinful games of chance
they may possibly understand the situation.
Even at whist one side must lose, but if the
losers habitually throw offal at the winners,
because they have won, the world is apt to
look upon them as being nearly related to
the common hog, and to cast them out to
their congenial dunghill.
How Parkes ran Amok.
A fortnight ago Henry Parkes started busi-
ness as an Ishmael, and since then his hand
has been against every man, and every man’s
hand has been against him. In a general sort
of way the old man has thrown up everything
and abjured everybody. He went back on the
world in general, and cursed the Foreign-trade
party, and the Protectionist party, and the
Labour party, with a wild, unmitigated, far-
reaching curse. The occasion of the trouble
was a motion by Mr. C. H. Reid, who sought
to have it declared that N.S. Wales was still
true to the principles of Foreign-trade, and on
such occasions Parkes has hitherto been a
tower of strength to the imported shoddy
interest. But, in this instance, he took an
altogether unexpected line, and after practi-
cally declaring that both parties were too
loathsome for him to associate with, he mourn-
fully put on bis hat and went to bed. The
division resulted in favour of Protection by a
majority of eight, and the veteran ghost-
raiser of Kiatna was the only member
whose vote was unaccounted for. Conse-
quently Pabkes has become the missing link
of New South Wales politics, for apparently he
is no longer a Foreign-trader—seeing that he
declined to vote for a motion that simply
affirmed the principle of Foreign-trade in Its
baldest form ; and seemingly he has not become
a Protectionist seeing that his language
against Protection is as wild and fervent as of
yore. And all that is known of him now is
that in the hour of his country’s necessity he is
a vanished poet, the embodiment of an escaped
I 0 U—the memory of a lost Federationist—a
hairy nonentity looking for his lost “ h ” in the
darkness of oblivion.
* * *
When the old Foreign-trade Government
came to grief a month or two ago, and Pabkes
threw up his salary and his leadership of the
shoddy faction in New South Wales politics, it
was obvious that there were stormy times
ahead. The ancient politician went home,
ostensibly to lead a simple, pastoral existence in
his garden, and to blast poetry out of himself,
and look after his parrot and his monkey, and
it was generally understood that public life
would know him no more. He kept a diary in
these days, and warbled little songs among the
trees, and fished for rhymes in his inner con-
sciousness with high and noble thoughts for bait,
and it was understood that the old Pabkes was
dead, and a new agricultural Pabkes had risen
in his stead. But presently the venerable poli-
tician began to snort ominously among his
native foliage. He twice declined the leader-
ship of his old party, and when the party
accepted his dictum he grew offensive in his
language. What he obviously intended was
that his late followers should ask him twelve
times or more to come forth and lead them, and
that he should refuse each time, and bid his
supporters keep the fact seci’et as he was averse
to fame and didn’t like publicity, and then that
they should rush and insert it in the papers,
and somebody should write leading articles
about it. And after that he meant that the
Foreign-.trade caucus should elect him unani-
mously despite his refusal, and then he would
rise up with a weary groan, and sacrifice him-
self as a patriot on the altar of his country.
After which he would come down wearily to the
House in a cab with his white hair and his
hollow eye visible as an advertisement at the
cab window ; and at the entrance to the legis-
lative halls he would get down amid the frantic
cheers of the assembled multitude, and tell the
cabman to call round next week for his money ;
and then he would go in and languidly demolish
the Dibbs Cabinet, and tramp on the Labour-
party, and strike a historical attitude on the
Ministerial bench once more. It was an in-
teresting picture, but like many other such
pictures it was never framed, and the election
of George Reid to the vacant situation filled
Pabkes with fury.
* # •
The Foreign-trade faction pervaded New
South Wales at the last general election, not as
the original party of cheap labour and cheap
imports, but in an entirely new capacity as the
party of Australian Federation. In other
words they professed to want Foreign-trade
and Federation ; but as the latter meant a
union of five Protectionist provinces with the
one solitary province which then adhered to the
great cause of shoddy, it was sufficiently
obvious that the Parliament of the Common-
wealth would give a solid majority for Protec-
tion, and that either the importing industry or
the sacred interests of union must go to wreck.
And the sacred cause of union went to wreck
in short order. Pabkes dropped it without a
single word of explanation as soon as the
election was over. It vanished out of sight as
if it had never existed, and when Pabkes dis-
appeared from the Legislature and went to be a
songful hermit beside the sea, his party at once
elected in his stead the most uncompromising
Foreign-trader—and the most relentless
opponent of Federation—in their ranks. They
did this by way of a practical announcement
that Foreign-trade was everything and Federa-
tion was nothing—that they did not care a
straw about the making of a new nation so
long as their monopoly was kept in good work-
ing order—and that when they stumped the
country in the cause of the Commonwealth they
only did it to boom the Calico Jimmy interest,
and fool the electors of New South Wales.
The whole of Pabkes’ old-established lie went
to pieces in one act, and it became manifest
that Foreign-trade and disunion went together,
and that Protection and Federation were one
and the same. The theory that five provinces
would give up their fixed policy at the bidding
of one—that one-half of New South Wales would
be a majority in the Commonwealth Parliament,
and the other half of New South Wales and all
the rest of the continent a minority—that the
whole regiment, in fact, would keep step with
Private Pabkes, instead of requiring that soli-
tary atom to keep step with it, was abandoned
there and then. The Foreign-traders, having
abandoned Federation, began to curse because
such men as Edmund Barton, to whftm Federa-
tion was practically everything, abandoned
them —in other words, the shoddy party aposta-
tised as one man, and then denounced Barton
and his friends as apostates because they
declined to apostatise also.
# • »
Pabkes himself was the only man in the
Assembly who possessed sufficient effrontery to
keep the venerable fiction going. Every other
politician had given up the pretence that some
500,000 Foreign-traders could unite with nearly
3,000,000 Protectionists and yet constitute a
voting majority in the Commonwealth, and he
had the field to himself. He came down, armed
with about a dozen distinct and separate
grievances. The Foreign - traders had not
elected him, against his will, to be their
leader. They had elected in his stead a
man who had more than once scoffed at
him and all his works. They had dropped
Federation, and with it Pabkes’ chance of ever
figuring as the Father of the Commonwealth.
The Labour-party had practically deserted him.
Nobody had expressed any particular regret at
his loss, or acknowledged that the country
couldn’t get on without him. There had been
no cataclysm owing to his absence—no earth-
quake—no day of mourning and desolation.
Nobody had proposed a grant of a large sum in


hard cash. He had not been publicly thanked
by both Houses ; there was no address of con-
dolence signed by a whole effusive nation, no
general subscription, no cablegram from the
Queen, no brass band—nothing at all. He was
simply allowed to fade away like a labourer
who had thrown up his job in a sewer, and
therefore he came down to the House in a
vicious mood and ran amok. He denounced
the Foreign-trade party because it had aban-
doned Federation, which was practically the
same as denouncing a hen for not having
teeth ; and he attacked the Federation party
because it didn’t adhere to Foreign-trade,
which was demanding an impossibility. He
threw great masses of Billingsgate around in
all directions. He grew incoherent, and swore,
and alluded to one Labour member who had
spoken against him as having the “soul of a
dog.” But, above all, he screamed with a fear-
some anathema at the happy little man with
the eye-glass who had taken his place as
leader of the Opposition. He cursed him
because he had been elected by the party,
and if he had taken the situation without
being elected lie would doubtless have cursed
still worse. He said that he possessed no
single spark of manhood, that he was obstinate,
passionate, incapable, and abusive, that he
declined to belong to his party, that he declined
to follow him or to recognise him, that he
loathed Protection, that he loathed the Labour
members, and in a general way that he loathed
things in general. Then he announced his
intention of voting with the Dibbs Govern-
ment, and a few minutes later he fled without
voting at all. Next morning every daily paper
in the province rose and threw its own literary
brick at Park ks. He was the largest renegade
on record—a man who had gone back on every-
thing in one act, and the whole country went
back on him in return. But presently the old
man, in his peaceful retirement at Balmain,
felt better. He had got into a state of mortifi-
cation and frenzy in which he had either to
blaspheme or burst, and he didn’t know how to
burst decently. Also, he had revealed himself as
an utterly base and unprincipled political hack,
who was willing to wreck his party and his
alleged life-long convictions for the sake of his
own wounded vanity, but he had so often
revealed himself in the same light before that
this fact is hardly worth mentioning.
# # #
On this same occasion the Labour-party made
a new start, and placed itself for the first time
on a coherent basis. When this organisation
was founded, one of its conspicuous features
was that —as a party—it pledged itself to
“sink the fiscal issue.” Practically this only
could mean that the party would give no block
vote either for Foreign-tradeor Protection, forthe
individual members of the party could no more
avoid having convictions on one side or the
other than they could avoid having been born.
But having pledged itself to sink the fiscal
issue, sundry members of the Single-tax and
Foreign-trade persuasion induced it to go back
on its pledge, and give a solid vote for Foreign-
trade on the pretence that, unless it did so, the
One-man-one-vote Bill would be endangered.
Next the party, in a moment of pique, turned
against the Parkes Cabinet, and wrecked the
measure which, above all others, it had been
returned to support. Then the Dibbs Govern-
ment introduced a Bill embodying this same
great principle, and the Labour-party, which
professed to care nothing at all for fiscal issues,
and which had already given a solid vote for
Foreign-trade in order to save this leading
plank of its platform, was certainly bound, by
its own logic, to give a solid Protectionist vote
in order to save it a second time. But though
the Protectionist members of the Labour
organisation had voted for Foreign-trade when
the One-Man-One-Vote principle hung on the
issue, the Foreign-trade section of the party
declined to make any such sacrifice. With a
fatuousness which is beyond all description, these
men, having undertaken to subordinate all fiscal
questions for the sake of their own programme,
deliberately attempted to wreck the Man-
hood Suffrage Bill a second time for the
sake of the importing monopoly and the
cause of low w T ages and cheap pauper labour.
Had they succeeded, the New South Wales
Labour members would have been remembered
in history as the only combination which ever
voted consistently against everybody wdio tried
to carry out its programme, and as the only
assemblage outside a lunatic asylum which
never lost a chance of deliberately wrecking its
own policy. As it was, twelve men gave their
support to the Dibbs Government, and thus
pi'eserved the Bill for the abolition of plural
voting from destruction, and fifteen declined -to
sink the fiscal issue, and, having turned traitors
to the cause of Labour, decided that the import-
ing monopoly of the York-street merchants was
of more account than the extinction of the
plural suffrage. And at latest advices the party
which voted against the Labour programme
was casting anathemas at the party which voted
for it; and the Herald and the Telegraph
and the Echo and the Evening News were all
blaspheming at the Labour members who
reckoned that the Labour cause was more
important than Foreign-trade ; and the
multitude was heaving rotten eggs at the re-
presentatives who adhered to their pledges,
being incited thereto by those other representa-
tives who didn’t adhere to their pledges ; and
there was a great row generally. And, above
all, the Foreign-trade section of the Labour-
party, which sold its constituents and its
faith for the sake of a fiscal superstition, is
raising Cain in a vociferous tone of voice, and
announces itself as the only genuine and un-
adulterated Labour-party, all others being a
base imitation. Which, taking it all round, is
about the largest and grandest specimen of
assurance on record.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Tramway Syndicate’s Troubles.
The Melbourne Tramway Company, the biggest
and most profitable monopoly in Australia, lias
resolved to cut down all wages in order to make
both ends meet. For, in theory, it has fallen
on evil days, and has become a poor, frozen-out.
hungry monopoly, which may presently be
reduced to going around with a hand-organ and
a monkey to raise its daily bread. Therefore
it has been reluctantly compelled to knock 20
per cent, of! all salaries over £5OO a year, and to
make smaller reductions from 10 to 5 per
cent, on all under that limit. The badly-paid
conductor, and the gripman, and the dingy
toiler who goes down under the roadway to
clear the malodorous slush off the wire rope,
and the greasy man at an infinitesimal wage
who cleans the lamps, will all have a share in
the general misfortune, but they are expected
to feel more pleasant over it through the know-
ledge that their better paid colleagues will lose
even more than they. But the man at £lOOO
per annum—-who is to be reduced to £Boo—is
almost invariably a large shareholder in the
concern ; the enormous saving in expenses will
make the dividends boom and the stock go up ;
he will lose £2OO a year in salary and probably re-
cover it all in dividends, and he will buy largely
for the inevitable rise, and make a good many
thousands in a lump over the transaction. The
fact that the large tramway potentate sacrifices
twice as much as the small looks a
great and noble fact—but he clears a huge
profit out of his apparent loss, and the other
man makes nothing but a loss. Moreover, the
whole thing is a glaring imposition. The
I ramway Company has paid enormous sums
in dividends, and has been, in its time, perhaps
the most profitable monopoly of its sort in
all the world. It shared none of its profits with
the poorer employes, and for that reason it has
no right to demand that they should share its
losses—if there are any. As it happens, how-
ever, there are none, for even in this time of
alleged disaster it is about the best paying pro-
perty in Australia. It still yields from 25 to
40 per cent, on the original capital, but by a
ceaseless process of watering the stock the divi-
dend appears to be only something like five.
An enterprise, whose real capital is £lOOO, if it
makes £lOOO of annual profit, is paying 100 per-
cent ; if it calls its capital £20,000, then it is
only making an apparent 5 per cent., but
though the name has vanished, the reality is
there all the same. There is something
stupendous in the front of the great tram mono-
poly which pleads poverty as an excuse for
cutting down the wages of its employes, simply
because it has dropped from being the
biggest municipal legal steal on earth
to the comparatively humble position of
the biggest steal in this continent. The
Melbourne Gas Company, too, finding its
dividends reduced to 25 per cent, on its original
capital, has likewise cut down the scantv wages
of its employes (many of them blacklegs who took
the places of unionists during the strike and now
get their reward) on the ground that it is a poor
and destitute concern which can’t find boots for
the ensuing winter. These two huge syndi-
cates are a solemn warning against the handing
over of great public works to what is euphoni-
ously termed “ private enterprise.” The Mel-
bourne trams will some day belong to the
State ; so—if it ever got started—would that
Sydney electric-lighting monopoly which has
the Daily Telegraph for its prophet. They
will both revert to the public when they are
old and worn out; when they have served as
instruments to squeeze millions out of the local
taxpayer ; and when newer methods have made
them obsolete and they are no longer worth
having. Still it is understood to be a comforting
circumstance that they will ultimately become
public property—when the present generation is
dead and the daisies are growing over its dust.
Then some new monopoly will be sprung upon
the next generation in their place, and so on,
ad infinitum. The only remedy is to utterly
wipe out the system of allowing what are
really national undertakings to drift into the
hands of private capitalists. If it is a good
thing that the tramway system and the electric-
lighting should belong to the State at some
period in the future, then it is also a good
thing that they should belong to the State from
their inception. If it is advisable that the
nation should own them when they are ancient
and worn-out, it is still more advisable that the
nation should own them when they are new
and serviceable. And if, on the other hand, it
is commendable that a private syndicate should
own them when they are new, the syndicate
should keep them when they are obsolete.
Also, if there is any reason for farming out a
tram system or an electric-lighting system to a
bowelless gang, then it is equally reasonable
to farm out the railways and the telegraphs in
the same way, and to lease the Post-office.
After that, tenders might be called for the
military and naval defence of the country, and
the police system might be managed by con-
tract. And—last and most logical of all—the
whole State might ultimately be run by tender,
the contractors undertaking to supply an
efficient Government and an Opposition, and a
Civil Service, and a judicial system, for so many
millions per annum. And then the principle of
‘ ‘ private enterprise ” w r ould have reached its
legitimate conclusion, and the Daily Tele-
graph would jubilate in its leading article,
which would be duly supplied by a syndicate
that would put an unbiassed opinion into every
newspaper office at reduced rates, and charge
for it through a meter.
Parkes’ Reserve Card.
The Bulletin has often pooh-poohed Parkes’
childish assertion that he reads not The Bul-
letin. It is now able to call the Great lAm
himself into the witness-box to prove that he
does. When the Dibbs Ministry was formed
a suggestion was made in these columns,
apropos of Toby Barton’s enthusing on
Federation, that the Ministry were under no
obligation to father the Commonwealth Bill,
and that it was competent for any private
member to take up the fad. The object of the
writer of the suggestion is in process of being
realised. The idea had occurred to the mind
of the old Parliamentary Hand ; and as soon as
he read the paragraph in The Bulletin he
determined, apparently, to dispute with
Toby Barton the pilotship of the measure.
This intention on his part he has now an-
nounced to the House. “I do not see why,”
he said cautiously, “it should be made a
Government question at all. Ido not see why
I should not introduce this subject as a. private
member, as well as a member of the Govern-
ment.” Toby Barton, if be is discreet, will
band back the “ holy cause ” to the care of Sir
Henry ; and thus remove a big boulder from
the course of the Ministerial coach. The
Government, if it introduced the question,
would waste, at least, twenty or thirty sittings
of the House, at a cost of £2OO a sitting ; but
Parkes, if he is humoured by the Government,
can only waste a night or two in a session, as
his unofficial position will not allow him to rig
the business-paper as he likes. The province,
therefore, would be an immense gainer by
leaving the fad in the hands of Parkes. It is
evident that the ancient Imperialist has a
little surprise ready to spring upon Parliament.
The nature of this bombshell may be surmised
fp °m an interview he sought with Sydney D.T.
He said—
That matter is beyond and over them. There will be a
further course adopted with Federation shortly, a course
neither Ministry nor Opposition can take up, but I am
not at liberty to give any further expression on the sub-
ject at present.
No treason, it is to be hoped, against the
autonomy of the Australias. If the subject is
“over and above” the provinces, then it is
within the scope alone of the Imperial Parlia-
ment. Is it intended by the Imperial Federa-
tionists, as a last resource, to petition Queen
Victoria to grant a Federal Constitution to the
Australias over the heads, and despite the
wishes of the Australians? Surely the Parkes-
G riffith-Gilliks faction won’t be so traitorous
to the hands that fed them as to intrigue for
that ignoble end ? Let these demo-
crats abide by the verdict of the people, and
drop the fad of Imperial Federation—at all
events until the Australias are thoroughly im-
perialised and corrupted. It might advance
the unholy cause to saddle the Australias with
a Governor-General Guelph for a decade. Are
the Imperialists afraid to try the experiment ?
The Imperial authorities, of course, are masters
of the situation—at present, and until demo-
cracy is defied. In the early fifties a full-blown
Governor-General was appointed in the person
of Sir William Denison; but the provinces
did not catch on to the idea of Imperial Federa-
tion ; and so no other Governor-General was
sent out. The reluctance of the Parliaments
of the Australias to approve the Commonwealth
Constitution must be very mortifying to the
Imperialists. What form of treachery they
contemplate against the Constitutions of these
provinces remains to be discovered by the course
of events. Let Imperialists inscribe in the
tablets of their memories that the Australians
will not be driven but will march bravely in to
the goal of their ambition—an Australian
Republic !
Honesty versus Auditing.
Melbourne is again in the throes of startling
financial disclosures, and public faith in ail
persons of “unimpeachable character” is for
the moment shaken. There has been a
monotonous succession of special meetings for
the purpose of acquainting shareholders with
the true position of affairs, and that position
invariably looks awkward for one or more of
the trusted individuals who play with the cash.
At these exciting times the voice of the daily
press is heard protesting against the looseness
of certain arrangements which enable scoundrels
to reek with the odour of respectability and
simple citizens to be robbed on easy terms.
The urgent necessity for more searching enquiry
into every company’s books is insisted upon by
writers whose notions of book-keeping are as
primitive as a cannibal’s Sunday clothes.
Accepting fraud as the inevitable outcome of
opportunities to commit it, and breaches of
confidence as the natural result of confidence
being there, these champions of morality would
like to see all books placed in the hands of
Government auditors, “ directly responsible to
the State ” for the genuineness of balance-sheets
issued by limited liability companies. The
probability of a Government auditor being
more of a muddle-headed humbug than his
unofficial brother, or of the State winking its
other eye at crooked concerns in which a
Premier and his friends might be interested,
doesn’t suggest itself to the average newspaper
critic. But, as the ancient would have enquired,
who will audit the auditors ? And why should
the poor outside investor have to look twice a
year, to even the best of financial policemen,
for his only assurance that the money he en-
trusted to the control of ‘ ‘ representative
gentlemen ” hasn’t been shovelled into their own
pockets? Honest management is worth more
to the investor than exhaustive auditing, and
decent men will be found plentiful enough in
Melbourne if the public seek them outside the
little clique of unprosecuted thieves, who supply
public companies with many of their directors
and chief working officials. The frauds now
being brought to light were bred of that cor-
ruption which taints the financial air, and
nurtured by a confident belief that one rogue
can’t be much worse than another in the Collins-
street district. And for this foul state of things
the daily press is considerably responsible, in-
asmuch as it preserves a solemn silence upon
many subjects, involving the “ honour” of men
who are still allowed to run swindles on their
reputations, and travel on their gorgeous front.
The arguments made by Queensland sugar-
planters with their cheap imported Italians are,
as was to be expected, all in favour of the
fatted employer. They embrace a period of two
years, and, in the case of men, the wages are
from 11s. to 12s. per week. The Bundaberg
Star publishes the full text of an ‘ ‘ agreement
for a youth between 15 and 18 years.” This
poor wretch is to get 9s. per week and rations
for two years, wages to be paid monthly ; he
is to work “as a general farm or agricultural
labourer, or in any other work about the plan-
tation,” he has the option of purchasing certain
land at “ the market value” (!), in 10 yearly
instalments, payable by keeping back wages
due ; any default in any payment, or in any
of the conditions, will forfeit all he has
paid and give the land back absolutely to
the employer —thus, if he neglects to pay
“all rates, assessments, and taxes,” or to
“ repair, and keep in good and substantial
repair, all buildings, fences, and improvements
now on, or hereafter to be erected on, the said
land ” (!) he just forfeits all his time and
money ; if he “ quit or absent himself” without
his employer’s leave, or ‘ ‘ refuse to obey the
reasonable demands” of the employer, “or his
overseer, or his authorised agent, then, in
addition to any other penalties or consequences
hereby imposed, this agreement shall be at an
end,” and the employer shall stick to the land
and to the “wages paid or credited.” Isn’t
the whole thing lovely? Will one enslaved
Italian ever acquire a patch of land under these
conditions ? It were over-sanguine folly to
fancy so. The regulation week’s rations is thus
scheduled:—Beef or mutton, 121 b. ; rice, 31b. ;
flour, olb., or bread, 81b. ; sugar, 21b. ; coffee,
Alb. ; salt, jrlb.

The proprietor of the Age is advised to try
the following light course of reading :—First,
his long article attacking The Bulletin ;
secondly, the Age’s soft and sweet account of
the arrest of Larkin, who was not then expected
“to be left to his own devices” by his in-
fluential friends; third, the Age’s loving and
tender interview with dear Matthias, during
which that stricken apostle remarked that the
local papers had treated him fairly ; fourth,
what The Bulletin had to say concerning
Larkin, its estimate of his character founded
on the bare fact that he was an embezzling
pietist, and its comments on the Age’s merciful
consideration for his little weakness ; and,
fifthly and lastly, the following extracts from
Age reports, printed after all hope of white
washing the “interviewed” criminal had been
abandoned: “Matthias Larkin is not only a
self-confessed thief ” (at first he was Mister
Larkin in grave financial difficulties) “but
recent disclosures stamp him as one of the most
consummate swindlers ever brought to the bar
of justice in this colony . . . that his
treachery was on the same magnificent scale as
the rest of his financial dealings is tolerably
certain . . . through it all the principal
has covered himself under a cloak of religion,
and stood forward as one deserving honour for
his donations to public institutions.” When
Mr. David Syme has digested that little lot of
literature he may possibly begin to understand
one of the fifteen reasons why The Bulletin is
so much more widely read and respected by its
readers than the rag which has a daily circula-
tion almost equal to the pound sterling total of
Larkin’s embezzlements.
If proof were needed of The Bulletin’s oft-
repeated charge that the orthodox illustrated
papers are shameless pimps for, and shameless
pandars to, Royalty and all its parasitic hypo-
crisies, that proof is notoriously supplied by a
recent special issue of the London Graphic,
which sets itself the evidently congenial degra-
dation of commemorating the jubilee of the
Prince of Wales. The Graphic gives a nauseous
narrative which, by a reckless stretch of
imagination, it calls a biography of the Prince
whose “fifty years service to the nation ” (!)
is declared to prove that “ he has truly lived
up to his princely motto— lch dien, I serve.”
According to the Graphic biographer, there
never was such another virtuous wonder as
Tummy, whether as baby, boy, hobbledehoy, or
man. Even at his baptism, the baby behaved
“ with truly princely decorum”—faugh! The
Queen consulted concerning Wales’s future
training the notorious Baron Stockmar (the
satyr of Karoline Bauer’s Memoirs), and
had the Prince educated on Stockmarian lines,
except that Her Gracious kept his “religious
principles ” under her own tuition. The
Graphic repeats the father’s cant that in ’5O
the 9-year-old prince was “ developing new
virtues daily and prates about “thesearching
examination into his religious belief ”(!!) just
before he was confirmed. By the way, his
confirmation was celebrated on an April Fools’
Day, so that it was probably as big a pretence
as the rest of his life. But the Graphic wades
chin-deep into a filthy morass of squirming
grovel as it hoists Tummy into manhood, and
lies about “ the pathos of his voice” on special
occasions ; the Christian interest he took in the
scenes of the Holy Land ; his rheumatic affec-
tion ; his thankfulness to God for his escape
from typhoid fever, etc. Not a word about the
Mordaunt affair, or the baccarat scandal,
which, after all, were the two chief events of
his otherwise well-covered-up life. The Graphu :
declares that Wales “can command an elo-
quence which few possess.” Very likely; a
prince or a millionaire can always purchase and
learn by rote the productions of the most
eloquent originals that exist; even Henniker
Heaton has shown this to be quite an ordinary
possibility. But the following will probably
send the strongest-stomached reader into active
nausea, as a sample of unblushing perjury :
1 ‘ His household has long been cited as a model
of domestic happiness. Wife, husband and
children are never so happy as when going
about together.” Leprosy of lickspittle, let’s
look for a pretty star actress who doesn’t know
better.
The usually pharisaical Sydney morning
Herald expresses its contempt for the Vic-
torian legislators who, under the Purification
of Rolls Bill, would disfranchise proved rogues
and vagabonds under the Police Offences Act,
and gaol-birds generally. The Bulletin does
not itself believe in the disfranchisement of any
free man entitled, as a man, to a parliamentary
vote, but it cannot miss the opportunity of
pointing out that the S.M. Herald, which
split the welkin with its horrified shrieks
when it was proposed to enfranchise
honest paupers in New South Wales whose
only sin was that they had never been
rogues enough t® know how to get rich, stands
forth boldly now’ as the self-elected champion
of the wife-beater, the larcenist, the sot, the
police vagrant, and the incorrigible rogue, and
warns legislators in dry, hard, solemn tones
that “ the limitation of the rights of citizenship
is a power that should be assumed with con-
siderable caution.” So says The Bulletin,
only The Bulletin would not limit the rights
of certain citizens merely because they are poor,
whereas the Herald would sponge out the
names of the poor, but reverently retain those
of the vicious and the criminal.

816 Macquarie-slreet North, Sydney, Dec. 23, 1891.
41 y Dear Moorauinda,—
Mr. Manning has been re-elected Mayor of Sydney by
the aldermen, but it is doubtful whether, if a popular
vote had been invited, he would have so unanimously
be m replaced in his lofty position. Socially, be isn’t the
joy and pride of those numerous cits, who regard-a Mayor
as an ermined person whose whole duty is to provide
them with free refreshments, and no matter how wisely
he may rule the city, the fact that he gave no public ball
Inst year and only one “come-one-come-all” advertised
reception turns the hearts of the populace—whose one
social hope is Town Hall-wards —against him. Seriously,
though, there is a marked tendency towards too res-
tricted a use of civic invitation-cards. It is a Mayor’s, or
rather, a mayoress’s, duty to entertain the people from
time to time—not to give hole-and-ccrner “at homes’
and “ little dances ” in the smallest rooms of the Town
Hall, to which are bidden a round-robin of personal
acquaintances. Of course, a Mayor can entertain any-
t idy he pleases, but he ought not to ignore the people,
gasping for amusement, who pay his screw and are
entitled, by holy precedent even if not by the literal con-
ditions of office, to at least three mob-receptions a year
and at least one big vulgar ball.
Apropos of Mayor Manning, the huge metaphysical
difference between man and woman was never so
accentuated as at the Sydney civic reception given to the
English team of cricketers. In addressing Dr. Grace, the
Mayor gushingly said that they “ had all read of the
great performances of this gentleman, and although it
was over 17 years since he (the Mayor) had had the plea-
sure of seeing him he seemed to him to be an evergreen
cricketer, and he did not know how he managed to pre-
serve his youthful appearance. Now, please, only
imagine for one instant the championess of a lady-eleven
on a visit being welcomed with such a remark !
A new and aggravating phase of the “ English ” mania
broke out badly recently in the report of a Sydney society
wedding in a local journal. In the list of polite blackmail
levied by the happy pair in the name of presents were
enumerated gifts from “ Mary Blank ” (with the family 28
years) and “ Jane Dash ” (with the family 15 years), as if
the “ family ” wanted to let the public know that they
had been paying wages all that long time. But it is
soothing to think that this can never become general
in Australia—the land of a fortnight’s solitude capped
by a “ warnin’.” Even the most ardent servant-flourisher
could scarcely announce the wedding-gifts of “Sarah
Jones” (three weeks with the family), and “Bridget
O’Toole ” (who stayed over Xmas).
Though the science of the bat and ball isn’t openly
alluded to in the curriculum of the British naval colleges,
it seems it is the principal pass for the aspirant to sea-dog
honours. Sir Precedence Scott, at a recent cricket-dinner,
said it was the custom amongst the ships of the navy to
play cricket matches, “and the captains of the ships
when getting young men always asked that a good
cricketer might be sent them.” Just so, Lord Charles. In
I hese piping times of peace a crew of cricketers is really
nil anybody wants on board H.M.S. Bloodthirsty. Also a
crew of first-class waltzers is just the very thing, and a
warship full of ladies’ men who can advise on crewel-
work and make almond toffee is worth its weight in gold
rm any naval station. Why, so far as Australia is con-
cerned, should the Lords of the Admiralty bother them-
selves in teaching people to find out what end a torpedo
sits down on ?
The enfant terrible we have always with us and the
frisky matron, whom hubby despatches for her annual
holiday, with Tommy to look after her, recognises in her
vacant-eyed, freckled-faced son and heir, her greatest
snag. If she lets him stop, and trusts to his “ not
noticing,” he rushes to the rescue howling, “ Oh, you
bad man to bite mama!” and if she locks him out in
order to have a “ business chat with Mr. Jones” she finds
the passages filled with boarders hanging round to
inspect her last business adviser. At a big hotel the
other day one of these unconscious watch-dogs strolled
into the room of an old maid boarder, who pettishly
asked him why he didn’t go to his mama? “Oh, ma
don’t want me. She’s got Mr. Dash with her now and
told me to run away and play 1” Four o’clock tea in the
ladies’ parlor didn’t lack flavour that afternoon.
A girl played a cruel trick upon an unsuspecting man-
friend who got married in a Sydney Eastern suburb the
other day. The victim possessed a large and faithful dog
which clung to him like a shadow, but on the eventful
morning Toby went missing, and whistlings and callings
brought him not. But when the cab which bore the
bridegroom to church was hurtling down the main street
Toby turned up. Only you couldn’t tell it was Toby at a
glance, because he was got up in a long white dress with
holes for his legs, which were covered with white stockings,
a wreath of orange-blossom was fixed firmly round his
head, and a square of mosquito-net floated backwards
from the wreath. Barking and jumping, Toby swarmed
after his unconscious master, who flattered himself that
nobody could detect he was a bridegroom, and wondered
what the dickens the people in the street were laughing
at, until he alighted sprucely amid a gaping crowd, and
Toby, with the orange-blossoms askew over one red eye
and the veil in three strips, not to mention the tumbled
wedding-garment, leapt rapturously upon him. At first
he thought it was his bride gone mad with joy, but he
soon remembered that his Juliet didn’t bark and hadn’t a
cold, wet nose, and then he understood why the pave-
ments had been one broad grip
The latest Brisbane sensation is, I am told, a marriage
per Registrar. He a moneyed British chappie, and a
well-known barmaid she. He, with £7OOO a year and heir
to a title, was the lion of Brisbane sassiety for many
months. He forsook it because, he said, “ there was no
sassiety in Brisban...” Almost every “ real swell ” 1 have
ever heard of who said “ there, was no sassiety in the—
ah—colonies” married a barmaid.
They buried him gently at dead of night,
The flattened result of that pudding’s flight.
Sydney Woman’s Suffrage League, if it has at heart the
interests of its own sex, should shriek for a concession
similar to that granted to Victorian female Government
officials, who now, when leaving the Service, on marriage
or otherwise, are given a month's pay for every year of
service. Official man’s inhumanity to official woman has
all along suffered her to pay a portion of her hard-earned
screw to the pension-fund, and the only way in which she
has hitherto been able to get her money hack was by
remaining a blighted spinster up to the superannuation
age, when the country had to disgorge her pittance. She
had all along to pay as much, pro rata, as a man, and
yet if she got married her little investments went to
the departmental man, while if he got married, he kept
on working, and his wife pocketed compensation on his
death, or he hung on till pension-time, and finally retired
on an income made up of the embezzled deposits of she-
officials who had left their situation at the call of Love.
And that’s how the hapless female servant of the country
is sf ill circumstanced in N.S.W.—greatly, I notice, to the
S.M. Hbrai.d's sixteenth-century satisfaction.
And as there is a moral Grundified aspect of the afore-
said question, the Social Purists ought to take the matter
up. Kveryhody remembers how it transpired that the
“ niece” of a lady official in a certain Sydney suburb was
really her daughter; and only the other day another
spinster official was dismissed because her faithful help,
“ having her suspicions,” communicated them to the
police, with a result that the gentleman was seen to admit
himself witli a latch-key after 11 p.m. ; the inspector did
the rest. Both these affairs may perhaps he traced in-
directly to the regulations. It is not likely that a woman (
who has worked hard for years, and subscribed regularly
to the one-sided fund, will marry in a regular way some
man with probably not enough for their joint support,
and leave the billet which supports her, and the pension
that will support her, merely to revel in Love’s young
dream. So sometimes you hear about the resultant
Romeo, and sometimes you don’t.
Even if Mrs. Julian Ashton’s now celebrated essay on the
Marriage Question, read before the Sydney’s Woman’s
Suffrage Association, were a plea for free love in the
generally accepted meaning of the term (which anyone
who reads the whole of the essay will find it easy to deny),
I don’t see why the daily paper whose lady representative
she is or was should come down so heavily upon her in
its leading columns. Accepting even the most jaundiced
interpretation of Mrs. Ashton’s paper, what do we find ?
Why, only a defence of what I have always understood to
he the cardinal principles of the D.T.—Preetrade and
Freedom of Contract!
If the Sydney cab-ranks maintain their hostile attitude
towards Bishop Smith—whom they refuse to whisk to his
destination, alleging that he does not pay them fair rates
—the spick gaiters of William Sydney will become frayed
and dusty—unless he adopt the threepenny ’bus or buys
(this would be Scriptural) an ass to travel on. It is only
fair to say that the Bishop (no connection of mine, by the
way) denies the cabmen’s version of the matter ; but lam
afraid the mere fact of his being a bishop is in itself a
strong prima facie case against him. It’s only fitting that
a Primate should cheapen his cabs. Ninety-nine out of
every 100 women do it, and as most sections of the clergy
are writ down as women in the lexicon of porters*
waiters, grooms, guards, and so on, it’s not surprising to
hear of a parson playing it low down on a cab-horse.
Woman’s way is to bang at the driver to rush the animal
in the shafts up-hill and down at top speed, and then
hand him a shilling for a two-shilling run, and take his
number if he tells them “as ’ow he wouldn’t never have
took ’em in his kib if ’e’d seen their sort.” Some women
grasp the unwritten code of righteous cab-fares—the few
and far-between females who are “ good fellows,” and who
would much rather ill-treat a man than a horse. But
men, as a rule, are too mean to women to allow them
enough money to develope the quality of camaraderie.
So cabby always scents a haggle ahead when he is hailed
by anything in petticoats.
The reason why the obituary “poitry” in the evening
newspapers always fits the deceased so loosely is, I find,
that it is not built out of the sorrow of the loved ones left
behind, but is constructed by the office bard and supplied
to mourners on the hit-or-miss principle. The weeping
daughter of a dead parent took her lugubrious ad. to an
evening paper office last week, and told the young man
behind the counter that she had been up all night trying
to fit some rhymes on to poor old mother, but that none
of it sounded like the beautiful verses she had noticed in
the paper, and so she would have to let dear mother go
without any “poitry” about her. But the young man
smiled a comforting smile. “ We supply poitry to adver-
tisers without charge” he said; “ I’ll show you several
specimens, and you can pick what you like.” And the
comforted maiden “picked.” All this was actually wit-
nessed at the counter by a friend of mine.

That genuine musician, Mrs. Harry Woods (Miss Maud
Pitzstubbs), long known as Sydney’s most talented
amateur pianiste, is now receiving pupils at Huenerbein’s.
Mrs. Woods can get more good music out of a piano with
less fuss than almost any woman I ever heard play in all
my life, and as she is believed to be a most patient
and capable teacher, 1 am sure her list will soon be full.
The latest Australian musical composition that has
reached me is the “ Louie ” Mazurka de Salon by Frederic
C. Sparks, in a bright-blue cover (the music, not the com-
poser) and a leading melody in E flat, which is as bright
and jerky as need be. It is dedicated to Mr. Thomas
Messiter, of Maoriland.
“ The ladies' committee of the Carington Convalescent
Hospital, Camden, are getting up a pincushion and doll’s
fair, on the lines of the bazaar held in Melbourne, in aid of
the funds. Lord and Lady Jersey are patron saints, so
there ought to be something handsome taken at the
doors. It is a pity, though, that the bazaar isn’t to be
more sensibly stocked. There doesn’t seem to be a
positive out-reaching after dolls just at present, and even
pincushions by the peck don’t seem to be the mad draw
of long ago.
That startling newspaper account of how a gay Lothario
from ’Ome acted the Don Juan to the “ six charming
daughters of a respected merchant with a warehouse at
West Sydney,” was a lovely sample of the transparent
“ sensations ” foisted on a trusting public. The story had
“fiction” writ large all over it. The plot was that a
plausible Englishman was made too comfortable at the
merchant’s house, was attentive to each one of the girls,
and when he went, left behind him the usual result—
multiplied by six. The father is now said to be in pursuit
of the villain. The story is spiced enough, but it hasn’t a
psychological leg to stand on Just for one thing,

The creditors of a Melbourne “ legal

Dr. technaebel, the German metallurgist,

“ I should not have lived so long if it had
not been for my sweetheart,” was the last written
declaration of an East Richmond (Melb.) man,
whose missing body was a subject of enquiry at

the other sort of man, who wouldn’t have died so
soon if it hadn’t been for his wife !
Mr. Toohey, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), wishes to
have it known, with reference to a recent Bulle-
tin paragraph, that he is in no way connected in
business of any kind with Matthias Larkin, the
Melbourne defaulter, and that he has never
visited Melbourne for the purpose of conferring
with Larkin or any of Larkin’s friends.
Mr. Kelly, M.P., has succeeded in getting
the N.S.W. Assembly to resolve that no system
of Federation will be acceptable which does not
provide for single voting at the election of members
to the House of Representatives. Hereupon a
Sydney daily remarks that Kelly “appears to
have One-man-one-vote on the brain.” It is the
right thing to have on the brain. It is the
foundation of all things, the bedrock of democracy.
Dear Bulletin, —The £64,000 placed on
the Queensland. Estimates to assist immigration
not only affects that province but menaces N.S. W.
and Victoria. W hen the embryo colonist arrives
in Brisbane and finds that things are not the
colour painted by the Government-lecturer, he
invariably treads south. It is not an unusual
sight after the arrival of an immigrant ship at
Brisbane to see a file of new-chum swagsmen
passing through Tenterfield or any of the northern
townships at the orthodox gait of two miles an
hour. Any of your northern correspondents can
verify this. —Yours, Dan Inglis. Turnback.
Showy River, 2nd Dec.
Sir Edward Braddon, Agent-General for
Tasmania, who, the cable tells us, has taken up
the cudgels against Australia’s “ globe-trotting
critics,” is a scribbler whom Tasmanians will not
forget in a hurry. As an ex-Anglo-Indian Civil
Servant, he was accused of abusing the hospitality
tendered him on his first arrival in Tasmania by
writing in an Indian journal some most insulting
criticisms on the political and social life of the
Island. The “perks” of his position, and his
insatiable thirst for notoriety, seem to be the only
things which actuate him in his latest develop-
ment.
The latest N.S.W. school map of Australia
shows a trunk line of railway from Cape York to
somewhere at the back of Princess Charlotte Bay.
The railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek,
which railway exists as part of the future trans-
continental line, is not marked at all. Two such
palpable blunders should never have been passed
by any man in authority. If the map-man had
projected a line, not at Cape York, but in any
place where there was any likelihood of there ever
being one it would have been pardonable, but in
the Cape York country there is more scrub to the
square foot, more ticks to the square inch, more
niggers to the square mile and more alligators
to the cubic yard than anywhere else in Australia.
South Melbourne is full of funny stories
about Larkin. A few days before the great
financial explosion Lord Sheffield had accepted
an invitation to come and stay chez Matthias
arion, in order to show his respect for such a dis-
tinguished patron of local cricket. Matthias,
indeed, was the boss god of all the clubs in the
district, and on the night of his arrest he didn’t
forget to send a note of apology for his unavoid-
able absence from a cricket dinner at which the
boys drank his health and sang “He’s a Jolly
Good Fellow ” with delicious gusto. It is a pity
that the good fellow wasn’t able to attend that
now historic feed, and make a speech just
previous to being arrested, because Matthias
seldom got upon his legs without thanking Heaven
that he had never, never given his father and
mother cause to blush for him. Larkin senior,
by the way, is a thrifty old person who still drives
one of his own milk-carts, and if he had any con-
siderable portion of his savings invested in Matt’s
building society he probably turned as red as a
turkey-cock on finding that his dutiful son had
“ tripped ” ’em up all round.
To the inventive genius of a lady in 1843
are we indebted for the first ice-cream freezer,
but those ladies who wish to save time, labour,
arid money invest in the New German Freezer.
Why ? There is no handle to turn, not half so
much ice used, and it keeps the cream firm in or

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that‘ladles who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Criterion “ La Mascotte.”
Theatre Royal “ The Forty Thieves.”
Her Majesty’s “Babes in the Wood.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess' . .. “The Merry Monarch.”
Alexandra “ Jack and the Beanstalk. ’
Bijou .... “Much Ado About No-
thing.”
Theatre Royal “ Dick Whittington.”
Having got 14 nights good biz. out of
“Mikado” with the juveniles, the “Pirates of
Penzance ” was put up on Saturday night at the
Criterion. The latter work is probably easier to
handle, but then it is by no means so popular.
As Major-General Stanley, Master Alf. Stephens
repeated his Ko-Ko success, and, save for a slight
tendency to nasality, was everything that the
heart of a hard-to-please public could desire. The
surprise of the show, however, was provided by
the singing of Marion Mitchell, formerly
grievously misplaced as Nanki-Poo. The Ruth
was Miss Maud Clark —her first appearance on
any stage—who sang the music with a full voice.
The Frederick was overweighted; it seems diffi-
cult to get voices for the tenor parts. This show
is drawing good houses in very bad times.
** * *
At Sydney Garrick, the Cogills provide a
very good show of the minstrel brand. Its most
remarkable features are the funnyisms of bur old
friend, William Horace Bent, albeit he cracks
some very musty chestnuts, the elephantine jocu-
larity of Charlie Cogill, and the vocalisms of
Percy Shannon. Other favourites are Nita Steele
and Grace Roberts, and if the Maher Bros, would
permit the company to sing the “Diamond eyes
a’ dancing in the dell” trash which they now
buzz-saw off in lengths, while continuing to do
their own dancing, everyone would like them ever
so much better. The Sisters Anderson, also
expert dancers, are not quite so much at home in
clog business as in shoe or hornpipe dancing.
Probably the funniest part of the show is pro-
vided in the shadow pantomime.
** * *
“ Confusion,” Derrick’s story of a hidden
dog, a misplaced baby, a wife who never sickens
of the nyum-nymn business, her husband who
does, an elderly masher, an elderly female aspirant
to marriage, a foolish footman and his sensitive
wife, was last seen at Her Majesty’s over two
years ago. The cast is the same as then, except
as regards the defection of Sterling Whyte, Emily
Fitzroy, and another lady; the vacancies are
filled by William Rignold, Miss Conroy, and
Bessie Rignold, on the whole to the advantage of
the play. So far as we’ve been permitted to
observe, the weak feature of the show is a tend-
ency to beat out the funny business to attenuity
in places. Business has been consistently good,
but not worth blowing about. “Babes in the
Wood ” gets a night’s start of the other pantomime
by going into harness on Christmas Eve, and a
concert will be given on Christmas, when Annis
Montague, Messrs. Charles Turner, Riceardi,
Hallewell, and Rivers Allpress will perform.
** * *
Sydney Royal, closed for a fortnight, will
be opened on Boxing Night with “The Forty
Thieves.” In addition to the previously cata-
logued collection of foreign talent Pattie Browne
will make her first appearance, since she attained
fame at all events, in a leg-part, as Ganein. That
fact alone ought to ensure the success of the
show.
The Misses Albu took their farewell of
Coogee Aquarium last Sunday. On Boxing Day,
in addition to many other novelties, Professor
Fernandez will make a balloon ascent and para-
chute descent. A big aquatic carnival took place
on Saturday.

Johnny Sheridanopenshis Vienna Summer
Garden entertainments at Darlinghurst Rink on
Boxing Night. He promises heaps of novelties,
a well-ventilated building, lots of room to move
about, and stacks of cool refreshment, with an
orchestra of 60 performers, a big ballet, a good
chorus, and heaps of clever performers.

At Bondi Aquarium Alfred Wyburd has
provided a programme for Boxing Day of such
extravagant dimensions that our space is alto-
gether inadequate to afford any idea of its glories.
Melbourne shows have been many and
various during the past fortnight. At the Prin-
cess’s there was good business for “Marjorie,”
The Fairy Queen is due again
On Boxing Night;
The wicked Gnome will then be slain
(And serve him right)—
The dainty Prince with flaxen hair
Will woo and win his lady fair,
And lead her from the Demon’s Lair
To Realms of Light.
That Fairy Queen she never dies
(We would she might),
But waves her wand and still defies
The wicked Sprite ;
The Prince, to old tradition true,
Comes forth in tights the maid to WOO,
And nothing is exactly new
On Boxing Night.
But, though we find the pantomime
Absurdly trite,
Fresh kids are growing all the time,
And faces bright
Will put to shame the cynic’s frown,
And cast a halo round the clown
Till laughter rings the curtain down
On Boxing Night.

better for “ lolauthe” (six nights of each), and a
huge first night for “ The Yeomen of the Guard ”
on Saturday, Gilbert and Sullivan’s gloomsome
opera is to last over this evening (Christmas Eve).
“ Silver Shield ” created no sensation worth
mentioning at the Bijou, nor did “Led Astray”
crowd the house to suffocation, Lyndal, dis-
guised as an amorous poet, was a very annoying
circumstance in “ Led Astray,” and evqn Tither-
adge made nothing of the great duel scene into
which the late Charles Thorne put so much pic-
turesque intensity. In fact, the difference bet ween
the original duel, fought under the author’s stage
management, and the modern Australian render-
ing is noticeable enough to suggest that Boucicault,
the younger, never saw the American actor in his
father's play. No matter; “Led Astray”
is done with, and the Bijou keeps this evening
sacred to a dress rehearsal of the great com-
ing event. The Alexandra dramatic season
came to a dull, damp conclusion on Saturday.
Its last nights were saddened by another
revival of “East Lynne,” and the ghost of dear
little Willie, attended by a snivelling penitent in
blue spectacles and a winding-sheet, might have
been seen of late glaring from the innermost
recesses of the gloomy pit at Dampier’s pantomime
preparations. The avowed reason for producing
“East Lynne” was the peculiar appropriateness
of that drama to a festive period. “ Christmas is
coming—let me play Lady Isabel and be merry,”
said the artless Lily D.

Walter Bentley, at the Royal, moved
certain publications to gush over his rough, un-
interesting performance of the burgomaster in
“The Bells,” yet the public stedfastly refused to
follow suit. Bentley lacks the necessary force
and magnetism to make a deep impression upon
his audience, and the senile old murderer that he
puts before them in this instance, creates neither
horror nor sympathy in the front of the house.
“The Fool’s Revenge” likewise failed to shock
’em for similar reasons, but gentle Miss Laura
Hansen, despite her weak voice, proved herself a
winsome, unaffected ingenue in both plays.
“Othello,” with Lord Hopetoun in the chair,
brought Bentley to a close on Monday night, since
when the Royal has been out of the hurly-burly,
m * *
fhe shutters went up at Melbourne Opera
House more than a week ago, even the genius of
George Darrell /being unable to keep the Mac-
Mahonian regime on its shaky legs. Tennyson
Dickens has hired the theatre for a Xmas Night
with the works of his revered father, but no
future arrangements (except those with the lessees’
creditors) were seriously talked about at time of
writing.
* # #
The collapse of the MacMahons is not a
loss to the drama, nor a surprise for the toadies
who hung round their necks in the days
of their mock prosperity, when they seemed
to have a loan of every paper published
in Melbourne. The very critics who held
up rot to admiration, and saw glorious successes
in miserable failures, arid extraordinary enterprise
in comparatively pettifogging ventures —these
same misrepresentatives of public opinion were
always ready to sneer in private at the men they
truckled to” so abjectly in print so long
as the MacMahoniau business advts. remained
extensive. There came the time when the
blatant management had to draw in its adver-
tising horns, and then the critics, lowering the
pitch of their notices in accordance with the
shameless custom of their trade, left off sneering
at “ Charlie” and “Jimmie,” because such sneers
were no longer necessary to uphold the “press’s ”
personal reputation for common sense. Besides,
the poor Macs became almost unobtrusive under
adversity, and perhaps their wistful glances
pierced the consciences of their former lick-
spittlers. Who knows but that the professional
butter-slingers of “respectable” journalism may
still have little bits of consciences concealed about
their persons ? To anyone capable of judging the
average intelligence of the times it was ever
apparent that the MacMahons had no chance of
succeeding against rival managers whose ex-
perience in the business is backed by brains.
The spirit of the cheap showman guided
the Macs, in their choice of attractions,
and it is a solemn fact that they couldn’t
understand why “ Evangeline ” turned most
folks sick, or why the whole country didn’t
roll no to stare at a bloated prize-fighter, or a
ridiculous mechanical race. They never seemed
to know a bad show when they saw it on their
own stage, and used to set down a first-night
failure to the “apathy of the audience.”
The Macs, in short, didn’t know enough for their
position. But they are down, awfully down, and
the writer has no desire to kick them. Which
is magnanimous, seeing that the brethren, jointly
and severally, have so often expressed a desire —a
carefully controlled desire —to kick the present
scribe because he didn’t lie at their feet along
with all the other fellows.

The four surviving Melbourne manage-
ments have put all their strength into the Xmas
productions. Dampier’s pantomime, “Jack the
Giant Killer,” is to re-open the Alexandra on
Xmas Eve, whereas “Dick Whittington,” at the
Royal, will be a Boxing Night event. On the
glorious 26th, too, 15. & B. purpose paralysing the
city with the extravagant splendour and archaeo-
logical correctness of “Much Ado about Nothing,”
whilst “The Merry Monarch” threatens to do
ditto away up at the Princess’. The “ M.M.” is
alleged to be an enormously funny and costly
affair. For the matter of which —no sort of
monarch can be set up on the cheap.
»* * *
The halls likewise intend to do the usual
thing, only more so. Frank Clark has hired a
new troupe of Japanese from the Emperor, or
somebody special, and these engaging heathens
will be attached to the Famous Folly Company
on Boxing Night. Very likely some of Clark’s
girls will form a kind of attachment to the best-
looking Japs. The little Victoria will probably
turn on an extra nigger or two, and a bevy of 50
beautiful ladies are to start a Picnic in the Alps at
St. George’s Hall, under the management of Al.
Carson.

Snazelle opens another season at the
Athenaeum with a brace of performances on
Christmas Day. The new entertainment consists
of a story from Dickens, fluctuating between
Gabriel Grub and the classic carol, assisted by
“ mysterious and beautiful effects,” also music and
other incidentals, all of which seem to have just
arrived by the Parramatta. The Exhibition chips
in with festivals and new alligators and so forth,
and the Waxworks has got startling novelties in
its eye. As for the Cycloramas, well, they can’t
change the bill for the holidays, but good old
“ Waterloo ” and “ The Siege of Paris ” w ill keep
$ appearing for twelve hours a day as before.
At Poverty Point.
Janet Aohureh, in a feeble and transparent advertising
deliverance, lately said : “ What worries me is that I find
myself unconsciously making professional sti dies at the
bedside of my sick and dying friends.” Bah ! a fig for
candour of that sort. They all do it. We were sick once
—hopeless case the doctors said. A sympathetic actress
came to see us with an armful of flowers. “Lo!" said
we, “ here is the eagle ! ” for bad she not chirped lo us in
the long ago ; “ Come to the wings and see me die in the
last act.” We now hate the woman who loves her art and
yet says it “ worries” her to see her friends die. A health
lo good old candid Thomas Griffiths Wainwright, who,
when dispenser in Hobart Town gaol, said to the dying
prisoner he hated : “ To-morrow you will be dead aiid 1
(rolling up his right sleeve) shall he up to there dissecting
you.”
On Sunday last the Misses Albu gave the first of a pro-
jected series of sacred concerts at the Garrick, when the
attendance was encouraging. Miss Julie sang, among
other items, “ Angels ever bright and fair,” the song that
introduced her to Sydney audiences, apparently the pick
of the portfolio, and worth going a pilgrimage to hear.
Miss Rose was most effective with “'Entreat me not to
leave thee.” Mr. Alfred Davidson, a somewhat tonsilitic
tenor, assisted ; Mons de Willimoff threw in a couple of
excellent violin solos; his orchestra played several pieces,
and Miss Louise Herbert, a lady too seldom heard, was
accompanist. Misses Albu give a sacred and secular
concert at the Garrick on Xmas night, and another on the
Sunday following.
They have been hissing, hooting, and pelting J, L-
Toole with hard substances at one of the English provin-
cial theatres, so much so that poor old Johnny fled the
town before his season of two consecutive nights had
expired. The alleged reason for this demolition of a
venerable fetish was a “slight increase on the usual
prices.” So evidently the time has arrived when even the
most verdant provincials object to paying extra for a bad
second-rate performance of “Paul Fry” and “The Birth-
place of Podgers.” One of these days J.L.T. will get him-
self killed by a turnip, or something. We can see it
coming.
Walter Bentley recently reported himself to the Mel-
bourne poli ;e as the victim of a mysterious midnight
attack by about ten men not in buckram. Fortunately,
Walter made a “ gallant defence,” and is supposed to
have knocked most of his assailants dead on the spot, but
their cold clay was carried off by the surviving ruffians,
and no arrests had been made up to the time of going to
press.
Melba was playing Juliet at St. Petersburg before all
the gros bonnets, including the Czar. During the per-
formance the Duke of Orleans arose in the stalls and
applauded vociferously. As it is Russian etiquette to
remain silent till the Czar applauds, the Little Fatherhad
Orleans “ slung out”—right out of the country.
Arthur Garner was, at latest, locat'd at Hampstead,
where he has a very nice place. At present he is enjoying
a holiday, but he will soon be on the look-out for some
new plays for Australia.
Harwood told our London correspondent that he was
bringing no new plays with him to Australia. He thinks
the business overdone.
Old Bob Soutar took a benefit the other day at London
Gaiety. He was for many years stage-manager there, and
it was at that theatre he met and married Nelly Farren,
who lived happily enough with him until a certain young
Australian appeared on the scene. Wouldn't it have been
nice if Nelly had been in London to join the galaxy of
talent which gathered to give a helping hand to old Bob
who, by the way, played for a long time with G. V. Brooke
and Walter Montgomery ? He created the part of Green
Jones, in the “ Ticket-of-Leave Man,” and no one has
since approached him in that character. He has also
written several very good farces.
Melbourne Age narrates a cock-and-bull story to the
effect that Williamson intended to present “The Merry
Monarch” for the first time on a private invitation night
(Dec. 30), when the Princess’ performance is to be bought
up by a military syndicate for the honour and glory of
Colonel Tom Price. The theatrical welcoming of this
distinguished warrior must necessarily take place with
closed doors, in the presence of swashbucklers, sworn
Tories and ladies only, so the promoters have engaged the
theatre, and will further engage a large body of police to
keep any of the masses from sneaking in without a ticket.
One unauthorised person in the amphitheatre would be
amply sufficient to. “queer” this ridiculous demonstra-
tion. When Tom Price and his Mounted Rifles came to
the footlights to swagger, as they presumably will at some
point of the proceedings, a voice from the gods would
shriek—“ Fire low and lay them out!” As matters are
arranged, the real reception of the gallant colonel will
take place outside the theatre.
Melba, in her divorce defence, alleges that within three
months of her marriage, in 1882, her husband struck her
on the cheek, at Port Mackay ; that two months after
the birth of her child, in Dec., 1883, he beat her with a
driving-whip ; that in 1886, on board the Bengal, on a
voyage from Melbourne, he struck her with his fist,
causing severe injuries ; that in 1887, in Brussels, he
pursued her with a razor ; in the autumn of 1889, at
Lausanne, he violently kicked her and threw a candle-
stick at her, w hich struck her a severe blow in the back.
In February of this year he renewed his ill-treatment.
In March last he extorted £BOO from her with which he
went to Australia, and in April he sent her a very violent
letter—so she says. Reads like a mere Old Bailey “case.”
Thus Snazelle to the Institute Committee at James-
town(S.A.): “Your hall-charge is too high. . . You ought
to-be glad to give it -for nothing for an entertainment
like mine. You mention prices as 2s. and Is. If two
street-singers and a clog-dancer were performing, they
couldn’t well charge less. ... I cannot very well
undertake to lose money by educating S.A. townships.
. . . My experience of the place and class of people
was not pleasant or conducive to my going to small
townships. The fact is the majority are not educated
enough to appreciate our work.”
Gerald and Duff, when playing “His Natural Life,” in
Fort Pirie (S.A.), sent round the usual chain-gang as an
ad. for the show. An old lady, who thought the thing
was genuine, asked permission fo invite the poor
fellows into her house for a meal. The “ w'arder ” (you
bet!) cordially consented. The old lady didn’t see
through the hoax until hubby camfe home.
Stanley’s dreary and pointless tale about the lion and
the rabbit, which The Bulletin printed as a sample of
the bosh that is to be found on the dark continent,
wasn’t even original. It was an American nigger tale,
originally told in the vernacular by Joel Chandler Harris
in the stories of “Uncle Remus,” and Stanley passed it
off as a native legend which he had picked up in Uganda.
When the explorer related it in a voice like the saddening
whirr of a lame grindstone, the only possible excuse for it
seemed to be that it was a sample of African idiocy - and
even that excuse is gone. Think of the intellectual
poverty of a man who went all through a mystic con-
tinent, and then couldn’t make a two hours’ yarn out of
his adventures without borrowing aged American chest-
nuts to fill up with !
Florence St. John has lost her divorce-suit against
Marius, the Court rejecting both her charges of cruelty
against the little Frenchman, and his charges of “im-
propriety” against Florence. By the way, the lady’s
apostolic stage name was suggested by that of her first
husband, St. James (late of Australia), who burst the
bonds of Hymen some two or three years after Marius
had cut him out. A very artless thing is the fair
“Sinjin.” Has anybody heard Knight Aston tell of the
delicate circumstance she once communicated to him
during a love scene in comic opera? Or the good stories
told about her by a well-known Australian manager ?
“ The Nantch Girl ” has run 150 nights up to now, and
Kflii* Stewart would have had plenty of opportunity to
lengthen and breadthen the part she rejected, in the
event of her being hailed as “ star” by the public. Nellie
seems to be making a fiasco of that trip “ home ” to play
an important London engagement. Her re-appearance
in Australia, with the same old laurels turning brown
upon her brow, would be too dreadful, so if nothing
better turns up Nell must certainly sing at a charity-
concert, or something, and arouse the usual furore.
G. R. Sims has received sundry love-letters from a
damsel who was mashed by a bogus G.R.S. at the seaside.
The vile impostor used to quote from the “ Dagonet
Ballads” by moonlight, and when he told her to address
all letters to the Referee office the girl fondly believed
that at last she had a real live author within her grasp.
Sims, who is a widower, ought to take compassion on his
misdirected correspondent and tell her to come along and
solace herself with one little hug at the genuine article.
Shiek Hadja Tajar, the chief of the Arab troupe with
Sells’ Circus, speaks English fluently and writes a good,
round hand. The musket which he spins at the rate of
500 revolutions a minute is some 4ft. 9in. long and weighs
121 b. The mission of the weapon whirling overhead or
before the body is to ward the sword cut or thrust of an
enemy.
Bache, a French actor, said he was not illegitimate,
because his father and mother were married, though not
to each other.
The Melbourne Royal pantomime, “ Whittington,” will
be the fourth time that subject has been treated in a
Melbourne pantomime. The first was 1657, when Fanny
Morgan astonished all With her imitation of Joey Gougen-
lieim, then the rage. The second and third, rival
Whittingtons, were both at the same Christmas, 10 years
ago, Royal and Princess’s, in Fred Marshall's time.
Sells’ Circus took £4OO in one morning and one evening
performance at Lithgow.
Coppin’s offer of £lOO first prize and £5O second for a
drama of the Sims-Pettit school, and 15 per cent, on th®
profits made in its production, is the advance-guard c*
many similar offers in the nearing future.
HR. S. Smythe wants to out-Smythe all his former
public ventures, let him get hold of Emin Pasha, and
take him round the woild with only one lecture : “ How I
E-caped from Devilfish Stanley.”
On the Ironbarks, there may be seen a circular mound
thrown up by a circus co. of many years ago, and
curiously enough a chestnut-tree now grows in the ring.
One of the clown’s jokes has evidently taken root.
Two patrons of the drama dropped into Melbourne
Bijou, the other night, and asked, “Are Brough and
Anson acting in whatever it is?” When the dress-circle
doorkeeper replied that A, and B. would duly appear the
enquirers came to the conclusion that it was all right,
and bought tickets for whatever it was. They knew the
name of the piece, in a general sort of way, without ask-
ing, or looking at an advt. They were going to see a
couple of old favourites play—The Fool, and felt secure of
their money’sworth.
The blushing Rose (Dampier’s business-manager) tells a
good yarn of the days when he drove a roaring trade as a
wizard and induced a W.A. bishop to go into the cabinet
and see strange visions. The pillar of faith was so im-
pressed by the spirit manifestations which attacked him
that Rose induced him to stand behind the footlights,
and right there, in his gaiters, testify' to the extraordinary
goings on inside the box ! Rose was a “ Lieutenant” at
that time, but he seems to have retired from the army on
full pay, or left the navy with a pension, and now he
wears the peaceful front name of Marmaduke.
The late veteran Australian circus-proprietor, James
Ashton, was a showman of a distinct type and bygone
period, lacking the exquisite suavity and pompousness of
his contemporary, Henry Burton. Yet he could reel off
a very creditable address to his audiences at intervals
and intermissions—these deliverings being given in a
brigandish manner, the ingredients comprising a little
Romany articulation etymology a la St. Giles. In his
earlier career his ability as a performer placed him in the
first of his class, and at full speed on a horse, and without
inflection of limb, he showed himself to be a master of
equilibrium. In his verbal communications he had the
faculty of adapting his phrases to the requirements of his
listener. Sounding his trumpet once to a cleric he
remarked: “Yes, sir, by the Lord, my turn-out humbles
’em all. 1 do all the big riding myself, and no
(adjective) lies.” Ebbs and flows in the tide of prosperity
were met by Ashton with undaunted front.
A “Gaiety” man is badly wanted by the Sydney
“books.” They’re after him —a mighty long way after.
Max O’Rell was to lecture at Glasgow. The chairman
introduced him to the audience in a “most queer and
incoherent speech,” and when he arose to speak the
audience “laughed at everything before he said it.” “The
lecture ended prematurely, and the chairman made
another queer speech. When we had retired to the
committee-room I said to the secretary, ‘ What’s the
matter with the president? Is he quite right?’ I added,
touching my forehead. ‘Oh,’ said the secretary, strik-
ing his chest as proudly as possible, ‘ he’s drunk —and so
am I! ’ The explanation of the whole strange evening
dawned upon mo. Of course they were drunk, and so
was the audience. That night I believe I was the only-
sober person on the premises.”

Answers to Correspondents.
“Stockwhip”: There’s a most intoxicated
aspect about your yarn .“St. George’’(Sydney); “Polities
in Arcadia ” is sadder than a suicide’s funeral on a wet
day... “A. G.G.” (Sydney): Yourdong poem in red ink
is desperately respectable and horribly moral. Publish
it as a tract “A Democrat”: Received a screed
beginning:
“ All hail to thee, Henry George, whose pen sublime
Hast made the world’s welkin with thy welcome ring.’
What is a welkin, anyhow, and do you take it boiled or
raw ?....“ C. A. N.” (Surat): Great Britain and Ireland
contain about 27,000,000 sheep ; N;S. Wales about
47,000,000. We should give our preference to Ogilvie...
“Japhet”: Declined. The Australian drunk is so much
like the American and a dozen other drunks that an
article on the local drunk falls flat.... “ Ignorance ”; (1)
Land Nationalisation is simply the ownership of all land
by the State. (2) Nobody in his senses proposes, that the
land shall be cut into equal allotments, one for each .in-
habitant. But only the State will own land, and anybody
who wants it for any purpose can rent it- provided there
happens to be any land vacant—just as he does now, and
pay rent to the Government instead of to the private land-
lord. (3) There will then lie no such thing as buying
land. You can’t buy a patch of ocean now and get a
freehold title to it, and fence it in, and land will be placed
on just the same footing. (4) We don’t seethe neccs-ily
for shooting the surplus population. There isn’t, and
never was, and perhaps never will be any surplus popula-
tion. (5) The publications relating to-marriage are
mostly erotic rubbish. (6) The two consultations
you mention are, we believe, perfectly genuine..,
“Stewart Wynne”: “Sunshine and Shadow ’ smooth
enough as verse, but ideas commonplace and sentiment
thin. We do not agree with you that “ Had we naught
but constant joy we’d sigh for grief again.” As well
maintain that a man with sound limbs is hankering after
a broken leg . ..“J.A.A.” (Sm’.thfield): “The Vigil” is
wild, weird, and wonderful. Rhyme and rhythm beyond

like one of Fuseli’s pictorial night-marcs done into verse.
.... “A. 8 trAy a way ” (Cooktown): “ What matters it” is
very good—will try and Use. Cannot find your “Open
Letter.” It must have gone astray in transit...
“J.F.8.”: “Repelled” is not had, but incident hardly
worthy the verse. “ Under the Faint” is cheap in senti-
ment, and the moralising is a shade too thin - the versifi
cation, also, is not 100 good ...“The Breaker”; You
haven’t struck the lead this time. It is now too late foi
any poet to express much oil of sentiment out of a horse
hospital.... “ George Harding ” : Why a soldier is never a
hero, and the digger always a hero, we fail to under-
stand. A miner is not necessarily one any more than is a
major, and your contention that it is necessary to go
down into the bowels of the earth to find a genuine man
is neither true nor poetical. Another thing: the ques-
tion of the existence of extensive- phunbism at Broken-
hill seems still a very open one “J.H.G.” (St. K.,Vic.);
The verse of “ Roar of the Multitude ” is good and it con-
tains strong lines, but your intention is misty. It is very

“N.A.T.” (Tasmania): There is a festive lookabout your
verses, but that is all. You might as well try to sing an
Act of Parliament.... “’Arry ”: Spoilt by frantic and
vain attempts at humour. Calling Booth “General
Marquee ” is not necessarily a mirthful circumstance...
“ Tote ” : One verse is enough—
You begin to degenerate after-that... “E. Harrow” (Maori-
land); If The Bulletin ever said any thing to aggravate
you it is easier to take it back than to argue
in this temperature. Therefore, we take it back.

No man is a competent judge in his own cause..
“A.L.”: Gladstone asserted that the Southern States

complete religious toleration, as in Turkey, but whereas,
in Turkey, only one faith is recognised by the State, in
France three get their clergy paid by Government—the
Catholic, professed by 98 per cent, of the population, the
Protestant, 600,000 nominal, the Jews, 63,000 in France

POLITICAL POINTS
There are this year very few drunks in
the S.A. Parliament.
“Name one corrupt act in my life.” —
Parkes. Answer : Being born.
Only one N.S. Wales M.P. was drunk on
the occasion of the recent big fiscal division.
Eureka Stockade anniversary, 3rd Dec.,
passed off almost unnoticed, but it won’t in 1991.
Adelaide dealers fear that the N.S.W.
proposed tariff will ruin their trade with the
Barrier district.
Barton thinks too fast and talks too fast
for the reporters, who say that the habit is grow-
ing upon him.
\ ictorian Railway returns show a falling-
off of £4OOO a-week for the last six months, as
compared with 1890.
Labouchere has pointed out how near
Princess Louise of Fife is to the British throne
with three such ineffectuals before her.
Parkes was the only possible voter who
shirked the division in N.S.W. Assembly on
Reid’s vote of censure. 'Four members paired.
Parkes has murdered his political wife,
N.S. W. Foreign-trade. Yet he clings to life—is
afraid to cut his own throat. Now comes the
hangman.
In the Bananaland Civil Service, 14 per-
sons draw salaries which total £33,545 ; it takes
the whole of the salaries of 335 others to amount
to £33,500.
London Daily Telegraph reluctantly
admits that “freetrade and unrestricted com-
petition have swept away the silk and ribbon
trade ” of Coventry.
Michael Davifct says he “ sees nothing in
the future of Canada but a Republic with un-
restricted reciprocity with the United States, or
annexation. ” He opposes annexation.
Trenwith mentioned, the other night, in
the Victorian Assembly, that he had a brother, a
bushman, much better informed than himself, but
precluded from a vote by his nomad occupation.
The S.A. Government has agreed to sub-
sidise the Northern Territory squatters by paying
£5OOO a year towards the carriage of their cattle
from Port Darwin to Java. Common people pay
as usual.
Carruthers, a day or two before the
N.S.W. fiscal division, said : “Reid is a lucky
man. He will eat his Xmas dinner as Premier of
N.S. Wales.” There’s many a slip ’twixt plum-
pudding and lip.”
The S.A. Constitution Act Amendment
Bill, requiring the re-election of Ministers after
taking office, was sponged out by reason of its
second reading not. commanding an absolute
majority of the House.
General Booth only wanted about a million
acres of the Darling Downs—the prize agricultural
area of Bananaland—grass plains all ready for
cultivation—and promised to pay his submerged
settlers quite “four shillings a week and food.”
“I am in the proud position now that
while Sir Henry Parkes may talk of me as he
likes, he can never brand me with the disgrace of
having been his colleague.” (Tremendous cheer-
ing.)— G. H. Reid, the N.S.W. Foreign-trade
leader.
Parliamentary consistency. At the last
S.A. general elections a majority of the successful
candidates promised to support the abolition of
the Customs duty on sugar. The House is now
supporting a Bill to increase the duty from £3 to
£5 per ton.
Chief Justice Lilley, Q., thinks that the
Commonwealth Bill of the late Federation Con-
vention “ was a fit instrument to cripple the
independence of Australia.” Just what The
Bulletin has maintained concerning any “federa-
tion under the Crown. ”
Sir John Bray, S.A. Chief Secretary, will
quit the office at the end of the year, to take the
Agent-Generalship. Six eagerly-expectant mem-
bers are anxiously watching the billet, and until
it is filled their votes are safe in the case of a no-
confidence motion.
The splendidly - efficient German army
costs £4B per man as against the English £l6O !
spent on a disorganised and incomplete force.
And now (England being thousands of horses
short), the War-office, it is cabled, proposes to
abolish two cavalry regiments.
Sydney D.T. howls :—“ Sinking the fiscal
issue meant sinking Protection.” Just as the
maintenance of slavery meant “freedom of con-
tract.” The D.T. further shrieks for a land-tax.
Which, of course, is not a fiscal issue, and does
not affect the hscus, or money-bag.
Within four years, the late alleged N. S.
Wales Freetrade Government collected £2,000,000
on necessaries of the breakfast-table, such as
biscuits, molasses, cheese, butter, bacon, fruit,
coffee, chocolate, tea, sago, etc. This unsoaps its
cant-bubble anent “ a free breakfast-table.”
In his splenetic speech on Reid’s motion
of censure, the pot-valiant Parkes avoided all
reference to Toby Barton’s seizure of the “ holy
cause ”of 1 ederation. The latter looked as if
eager for the fray—but Parkes realises that it
is not prudent to attack Barton to his face.
Because G. H. Reid drove the Parkesian
hosts before the people on the Imperialistic Com-
monwealth Bill, and carried N. S. Wales against
Imperial Federation, he committed “base and
bold treachery’’—against Parkesism and Jingoism!
Parkes hates Reid with a healthy, soul-consuming
The frontages to the Sydney Centennial
Park, if sold by the State to recoup the cost of
the park—£2oo,ooo!—will, J. P. Garvan dis-
covers, necessitate the erection of Parkes’ Dead-
hmise. Dibbs do his duty and repeal the
Dead-house ” portion of the Act, as he essayed
to do in 1887?
It transpires that the Australian Natives’
Association, Melbourne, arranged with Purves,
Q.C., to meet General Booth, on the platform, to
challenge the Darkest England scheme. The
General declined,* or otherwise there would have
been the most exciting debate since Trenwith and
Henry George.
House of Assembly in Adelaide. Time,
11.30 p.m. The Hon. J. L. Parsons: “If the
Government persist in going on with the business
at this late hour I shall call attention to the state
of the House.” Mr. Johnson, M.P. : “It would
be better to call attention to the state of the
honorable member.”
Last Friday, when the N.S. Wales Free-
trade minority stonewalled the Government for two
nights and a day, Sydney Echo blandly published
the fact under the heading, “ The Premier
A TOUGH CUSTOMER.
(Scene at the theatre when the lights were lowered and the music started).
SHE (nestling beside him); “And do you really love me?”
HE : “I could eat your boots.”
Obstinate.” When the Echo’s party declines to
be talked down it is “firm.” It is always the
other party that is “obstinate.”
“ Votaries of Protection are usually men
the least capable of thinking out anything for
themselves,” says Parkes. Yet, as Barton has
shown, Parkes when in the prime of his manhood
was a Protectionist and gave most logical reasons
for the faith that was in him. He now tells us to
accept the creed of his senility.
During the last two weeks the S.A. House
of Assembly has frequently gone on with its busi-
ness with ten or fewer members present. The
balance play Nap. in a room nearby, and come in
and vote enthusiastically on divisions, and quite
impartially, as they generally haven’t the remotest
idea what the dispute is about.
The S.A. Local Option party say the vote
of the people should decide what hotels should be
open and when. The same party strongly object
to the people having any local ■ option as to
whether hotels should be open on Sunday, on the
ground that “Sabbath observance” is too sacred
for common people to deal with.
Whilst the Licensed Victuallers Bill was
going through the S.A. Parliament lately, in
among a mass of regulations about license fees
and putting out the bar lights at 11 p.m., a private
member discovered a provision giving six months’
imprisonment to anyone who assisted a sailor to
desert from a ship of the Australian Squadron.
Provision knocked out.
W.A. Government has a firm grip of the
two Perth papers, whose State advertisements are
now becoming very solid and imposing. The
papers in question bark whenever they are told,
and ferociously jump upon an unfortunate member
named Traylen, who recently ventured to find
fault with some very questionable actions of the
Ministry during recess.
Bishop Moorhouse tells the Rhyl Church
Congress that the Victorian clergy tried their
hardest to give religious instruction in State
Schools. This, as Australia knows, is simply not
true. Finding that the State would no longer
subsidise religion in any form, the great bulk of
the Anglican clergy got the sulks, and let the
children “go to the devil.” This is true, not only
of Victoria, but of every other Australian pro-
vince and Maoriland.
The Prince of Wales, it is cabled, will
give the Duke of Clarence on his marriage a
palace to live in and .£20,000 a year. Where is
Wales going to get it all? From Baron Hirsch ?
—or at baccarat ? Another cable states that an
application is to be made to Parliament for
£15,000 a year for the vacuous-faced youth of
collars. This is probably a feeler. We hope to
see such a grant. It will help along the Repub-
licans.
The N.S.W. Freetrade is raking up the
fact that in speaking against Federation at the
Sydney Mayoral banquet in January, 1890, Mr.
Salomons, Q.C. (now a member of a Protectionist
Government) “ presumed to say that if a Federal
Parliament were called into existence Freetrade
was doomed.” After all, showing that Salomons,
Q.C., has come to view with complacency the in-
evitable doom of “ Freetrade ” is only showing that
yet another keen-witted man has left the camp of
shoddy for that of its enemies.
Miss Ackermann (Yankee), travelling in
the interests of various “Women’s Christian
Temperance Unions,” and so on, is resting in
Hobart, after an extended tour of Japan and
China. She lately said: “ I believe if the
Chinese were properly civilised, Christianised,
and organised, they could take the world, they
are so numerous.” An excellent reason why they
should not be “Christianised.” It is also one
added to a long list of reasons why every Chow
should forthwith be bundled out of Australasia—
dead or alive.
Brisbane Courier lias long accounted G.
H. Reid, of N.S.W., “a man of ambition, who
possessed neither the ability nor the tact which
alone would enable him to succeed.” But the
same paper pawns its reputation by stating, a
little further on, that “so long as Sir Henry
Parkes retains a seat in the Legislative Assembly,
, a ®d no other must be the leader of that side of
the House on which he sits.” This is infantile
bosh. N.S.W. is not yet limited to one essential
political Mahatma. The province possesses them
by scores, from J. P. T. Caulfield up to Mr. Crick,
and from Mr. Willis down to Sir Henry Parkes.
“I told Ministers that, if they proceeded
with honest legislation, I would support them
like a white man. But I further told them that,
if they introduced the fiscal question, I would
fight them like a blackfellow.”— Jawbone Neild,
M.L.A.
An English pamphleteer has a plan for
electing, say, 200 working men to the House of
Commons. Briefly, it is a vast co-operation,
combining business witli politics. Some com-
modity would be bought wholesale and sold retail,
the profits to accumulate for electioneering and
other political purposes. The writer supposes tea
to be the article bought, there being on tea a
profit of £2 10s. per 1001 b.-chest,.-chest, and he pro-
ceeds: —“If four chests, or 4001 b., were sold in
each constituency every week, it would mean an
income of <£lo a week, or <£s2o a year. If 400
persons agreed in each constituency to buv 11b. of
tea weekly, the profit would be still .£lO. The
men would carry on the work of political organi-
sation, the women would sell the tea.”
During the “censure” debate in N.S.W.
Assembly, on the eve of the division, a Minis-
terialist was decoyed off the premises, and was
rescued from the hands of the enemy as he was
stepping into his tram. The truant supporter
was then confined in a room by the Government
whip. The “vote” was now considered safe;
but a smart Oppositionist stole the key of the
room; and the loss was not discovered until the
division-bells were ringing. The situation was
critical, but the burly whip, Tom Hassall, rose to
the momentous occasion. With the aid of a
ladder, he passed the unconscious Ministerialist
through the window, and the “vote” was deposited
on the right bench just as the “bars ” were put
down.
Parkes’ recent attack on the leader of the
N.S.W. bogus-Freetrade-party, G. H. Reid,
shows him in his true light—in which The Bul-
letin has always regarded him —as a vain,
greedy, needy, ungrateful, unscrupulous, un-
patriotic, untrustworthy, canting old political
hypocrite, utterly incapable of a single public act
which does not minister to his wolfish selfishness
and egregious vain glory. The newspapers that
so long helped to keep him in power now talk of
the “putridity” of his methods, call him “the
arch-traitor,” in black type, and compare him to
Judas Iscariot. However, they are just as mean
and conscienceless as Parkes, and don’t now
squeal because they find he has no political
morals, but merely because he has planted
his knife under the fifth rib of the N.S.W.
Shoddy Brigade. The hireling prints will
support him again should he get into power
two years hence, and when he dies they will try
to stuff it down the public throat that’he was a
great and good man.
GONE!
Gone from the sweets of office,
Gone from the head of affairs,
Gone in the head they tell us,
Gone—and nobody cares !
Gone not to join the angels,
Gone to reflect on the past,
Gone into Opposition—
Parkes has gone at last!
Gone, let us trust, for ever,
Gone, whither none can tell;
Gone, let us hope, to Heaven—
There are devils enough in Hell.
G. H. R.
I)oth Jawbone gauge the queer impression
He leaves by making that confession ?
A blackfellovv, at distance, skites,
And only, from safe ambush, fights !
The nigger’s fight is three-parts fuss,
All cowardly, all treacherous:
The only weapon he can wield’s
The same as that of Jawbone Neild.
Bane and Antidote.
To every bane there is an antidote. The
triumphs of latter-day science have proved this
to be axiomatic, and merely a phase of nature’s
faultless preservation of equilibrium. Nature
has provided the virulent poison of the snake, and
at the same time furnished the vegetable juice to
render the virus innocuous. In the case of
human disease the discovery of the bane has been
the work of decades, sometimes centuries, and the
discovery of the antidote in many instances is
still hidden in the womb of the future. A
curative for cancer is not yet to hand, although it
is possible that the preventive is contained in
maintaining the soundness of the liver and
kidneys, which are the most important functional
organs of the body. To return to the heading of
this paper, take the bane of Bright’s disease of
the kidneys. Its discovery is of comparatively
recent date. For centuries the faculty had been
dealing with the poison of uric acid, totally un-
aware of the death-dealing influence it had in
various forms in different individuals, to such an
extent indeed, that it has been said that ninety
per cent, of the diseases in the human system are
traceable to kidney poison. In the old times
some forms of disease were attributed either to
providential dispensation, or the machinations of
a local witch, who was carefully burned for her
alleged criminality. The universal panacea for
almost every complaint was the letting out of
blood (or pumping it in); all ailments, from
dyspepsia to neuralgia being treated alike.
Further down a little scientific research combined
with some common sense brought to the rescue
the common leech, which came to be known as
“the doctor.” Then the introduction and feign
of Mineral Medicaments was entered upon. But
by far the greatest and most important event to
the whole human race has been the discovery of
that infallible antidote to all kidney and liver
poison—Warner’s safe cure. It is still proving
itself an unquestionable success, and is un-
doubtedly the medicine for the times. Whether
a man first feels only a little poorly, the cause of
which he cannot trace, or is suffering from the
dire debility succeeding an attack of influenza,
his wisest course will be to fly for relief to
Warner’s safe cure, which is the Antidote to 90
per cent, of the diseases affecting the human
frame, hence its recognised and admitted influence
and success.

Court or Council lately.
Larkin, the South Melbourne embezzler,
succeeded in getting damages as plaintiff in a

Rudyard Kipling is reported as refusing
to ink his pen for a 5000-word story unless
guaranteed £lO9 in advance.
Archbishop Carr (R.C., Vic.) used to take
his whisky, but gave it up, “ because every other
malm thought he could do so too.”
Tom Bracken, the Maoriland poet, who is
himself an Irishman, declares that the Scotch are
the only British people who really like poetry.
Notwithstanding all the Australian slobber,
the St. Paul’s (London) memorial to Dailey has
been the only one erected to “the shirt-sleeved
Caesar. ”
Some of the American newspapers do
Henry Lawson the honour of stealing his verses,
clumsily localising them and trading them off as
original.
Old John Dunmore Lang was always
orthodox, but those who arranged his monument
in Wynyard Square, Sydney, made him turn his
back on his church at last.
Bruce Smith has now decided in favour
of the law and the profits, and has again hung
out his professional shingle and returned to
practice at the N.S.W. Bar.
Parkes has admitted that his own Admin-
istrations have included men “quite unfit for
their offices. Yes, and the worst of it was that
so many of them lent him money.
If the Due d’ Orleans shirks British adju-
dication over his co-responience in the Melba
divorce-case, he will have to banish himself from
England. He is already exiled from France.
Adelina Patti’s experienced advice to
Madame Melba “ Don’t worry about the
divorce, my dear. Keep on singing your best,
and you will have the whole world at your feet.”
Stanley has refused to accept an address
from the N.S.W. Cambrian Society. He is pro
bably ashamed of his country. The Bulletin is
ashamed that his countrymen are not ashamed of
him.
Dr. Doyle Glanville (late of New Guinea),
who went with the N.S.W. Contingent to the
Soudan, died lately in South Africa. While suffer-
ing from fever, he got off his horse, lay down, and
expired.
“Twist ye, twine ye,” which appears in
one of the early chapters of “ Guy Mannering,” is
published under Ruskin’s signature in a recently-
issued volume of poems claimed by the latter as
his own!
Premier Dibbs must indeed be a bold
patriot. He is opposed to female suffrage (we
believe), and he taxes gloves and silks and
feminine falderals. Yet he is the father of 13
daughters !
That sturdy litigant, Barbour, M.L.A.,
who has dropped half-a-dozen fortunes down the
legal sink in law-suits, is one of the most deter-

Cheap Law Bill.
Herr Schnaebel, the German metallurgist,

When a Kidderminster townsman pro-
posed that a wedding-present should be given to
Lord Dudley, an amendment was raised that the

Lord Dudley reformed.”
Perkins, the viticultural expert who is
being brought from Tunis for S.A., claims among
his recommendations a perfect knowledge of the
“Australian language.” He is to get £350 a year
w ith rations and quarters.
The Bulletin would like to receive an
official contradiction of a statement it hears
repeatedly that several of the directors of the big
mine at Broken Hill now only hold their bare
qualification number of shares.
Sir Matthew Davies has stated that under
the circumstances he would prefer not to be
banqueted by the Victorian Assembly. Matthew,
who used to be such a terror for banquets, too !
Circumstances alter cases, evidently.
By the death of Sir William Macleay the
prospect of establishing a Sydney morning Protec-

William, it is understood, seriously contemplated
subscribing £30,000 of the £60,000 required.
Bingham Crowther—the levanting Hobart
medico charged with criminal malpractice, sported
a colossal door-plate on which was engraved,
“ Bingham Crowther, physician, surgeon, etc.”
People used to wonder what the “etc.” meant.
Now they know!
Samuel M ‘Go wan, of Melbourne, and not
Charles Todd, of Adelaide, was “the father of
the telegraph in Australia.” M'Gowan erected
telegraph lines between Melbourne and Sandridge
and Williamstown in ’s4—a year before Todd
came out to S.A.
It is solemnly recorded in one of the
London papers that when Queen Victoria was
informed that it had been extensively rumoured
that she had died suddenly, she was “ much dis-
tressed at the idea that such an awful mistake
could possibly have been made.”
In the Watts murder case, tried a few
days ago, at Adelaide, Symon, Q. 0., made the
finest defence yet known to old habitues of
Adelaide courts. His masterly cross-examination
of Geisber, the Crown’s principal witness, settled
the ease and Watts was acquitted.
Judge Boucaut (S.A.) has never presided
on the Bench when a prisoner has been convicted
of a capital offence, although he has tried a
great many. Judge Bundey had never tried a
capital case until last March, and then the
nrisoner, Lowenthal, was reprieved.

Lord Carington is hard at work electioneer-
ing, and expects that through his influence a
Liberal will wrest South Bucks from the present
Tory member, Lord Curzon. The Wycombe
people say that, nice as he was before, he is ever
so much nicer since he went to Australia.
Dr. J. A. Cockburn, the S.A. ex-Premieri
who is already inclined towards theosophy, mys-
ticism, and unintelligible religious ideas generally,
has just been surprised by being made a Fellow
of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, as a reward
for some humanitarian action he did years ago.
It took four bishops to educate John
Gavan Duffy, Victoria’s Postmaster-General.
Dr. Quinn, afterwards Bishop of Bathurst

A friend of Graham Berry explains that
G.B.’s knighthood was obtained for him by
“ Wales ” without his knowledge. However,
•this is very thin, for no man can be knighted
without his own consent. Like many another
rat, Berry was too hungry to turn away from the
toasted cheese in the trap.
George Nicholson Taylor, boss of the
defunct Melbourne Credit Bank, had (with his wife
and son) an unsecured overdraft from the bank
for £llOll,OOO ! His wife, a lady of some literary
ability, had, when he married her, property
amounting to between .£50,000 and .£60,000, since
all swamped in his land transactions.
The coming marriage of Tummy’s heir
will remind a good many people that the pallid
bridegroom first saw “ life ” in the society of his
equerry, Lord Arthur Somerset, the infamous
hero of the Cleveland-street scandal. Somerset
was just the man to prepare a foolish, plastic
princeling for the holy state of matrimony.
Barrister Edouiu Lilley pleading before
Chief Justice Lilley (Q.), his dad : “I object to
that as ultra vires.” His Honor : “ I do not
think so.” Edouin : “ Yes, it is.” _ His Honor :
“ Well, go on. Never mind. It is only a flat
contradiction of the Judge. I think, young gentle-
man, you ought to argue a little more politely.”
Sir Arthur Blyth, the deceased Agent-
General for S. Australia, was one of the framers
of the S.A. Constitution, and was also a pro-
minent supporter of Torrens’ Real Property Act
when it was introduced. Sir Arthur Blyth, with
his brother, Neville, conducted a small iron-
mongery business in Adelaide in the early days.
When John Haynes got married the
other day he told the readers of Sydney
Evening News about it, but forgot to
mention who the lady culprit was. _ The infor-
mation would have filled a passing hiatus, but it
is of little consequence now. The feminine indi-
viduality that was is now merged in the all-
absorbing personality of John.
The Anglicans hope to see the Archbishop
of Canterbury in Sydney and Melbourne next
year. The Bulletin cordially hopes that he will
come to this irreverent country, which only re-
spects the over-rated advertises it does not see.
On the same principle The Bulletin hopes to see
in Australia Albert Victor and the Princess Tick,
likewise all the Emperors and the Pope.
Edmund Gosse, in a recent number of the
Century, comparing Rudyard Kipling, as a poet,
with Adam Lindsay Gordon, says that Mr.
Kipling greatly excels the Australian poet in
“ variety of metre and force of language.” Now,
the two men cannot be compared. Gordon in his
own way was unique; perhaps some people may
think that, in his way, Kipling is also unique.
As a rhyming Jingo swash-buckler he certainly is
incomparable.
Taking kings as a body, it is about 73
chances out of 100 that a particular ruler is mad,
like the Kings of Bavaria; or blind, like the late
King of Hanover and the present Grand Duke of
Mecklenburg-Strelitz; or stone-deaf, like the
D’Orleans and the Danish Royal Family ; or an
epileptic, like the King of Spain ; or a man who
lives to bury his heir in an unhonoured grave, like
the Emperor of Austria or the late King of the
Netherlands.—The Speaker.
E. P. Wilson, generally known as “ Ted ”
Wilson, and eldest son of Sir James Milne
Wilson, K.0.M.G., once Premier of Tasmania,
was undoubtedly killed by the Y.D.L. Bank
smash. He never rallied from the moment the
news was telegraphed to him from Hobart to Lon-
don, and all the voyage out kept on exclaiming
“ I’m a ruined man, I’m a ruined man ! ” He
fancied he was doomed to starvation, and this in
spite of being worth =£150,000 after his liabilities
were paid !
When G. H. Reid, now leader of the
N.S.W. Opposition, first assumed office as secre-
tary to the N.S.W. Attorney-General, “Bob”
Williams, son of the late Crown Solicitor, was a
clerk in his father’s office. A chum called in at
the luncheon hour and hearing an extraordinary
noise asked what it was. “Oh ! ” said Bob, “ it’s
the fun of the world, we have a new chap in the
A.G.’s office, and he delivers speeches before the
glass in the dinner-hour.” Up stairs on tip-toe
with bated breath went the pair to hear George
delivering a “ masterly oration ” to an imaginary
crowd.
Warden Mowbray, whose word is.law to
Charters Towers’ diggers, is a jolly, dapper,
little man, without an atom of “ dignity.”
On the Hodgkinson, years ago, the present
writer saw him, in his capacity of warden,
marry a prttey girl to a miner. On finish-
ing the ceremony, Mowbray gallantly, and
as was his custom, kissed the bride. “Ah !”
loudly exclaimed one of the bridegroom’s friends,
“ it’s easy to see it'isn’t the first time the Commas
sioner has kissed Fanny.,” “Niver you moind,
retorted the happy swain, “so long as he hasn't
been kissing her too racently.”
The wife of London’s Lord Mayor-elect is
the daughter of a plumber named Boakes, whose
wife was a cook. Mrs. Alderman Evans, who
will soon occupy the Mansion House, was a cham-
bermaid at an inn in Sevenoaks when she capti-
vated the civic dignitary. He sent her to a
seminary to be educated, and married her. She
has attractive manners, is very good-looking, a.nd
is likely to do the honours of her new position
with grace and tact. Should the King of Italy
visit England next year he will be entertained in
the city, and as King Humbert is reckoned
amongst the “first-class” sovereigns, the prece-
dent of creating the Lord Mayor a baronet will
be followed, and the quondam chambermaid will
be Lady Evans.
Archbishop Walsh kicks the dead-body of
Parnell:—
To Catholics, the close of Mr. Parnell’s career is one of
terrible significance. Death has come in a home of sin ;
his last glimpse of the world unhallowed by the consola-
tions of religion ; his last memory linked forever with
hers whose presence seems to forbid a thought of repent-
ance. He has passed into eternity without a sign of
sorrow for the insult offered to morality, for his offence
against the law resting at the base of society, for his
revolt against his native land and against the anointed
prelates and m inisters of God’s church.
“That is,” remarks a contemporary, “Parnell
should have turned Catholic before he died, and
in order to do so, he would have been required to
disown the woman whom he had made his wife,
and who, though she wrecked his career, had
ruined herself for him.”
Stead is a short man with a slight stoop,
shabby clothes, and a dishevelled manner. As
he speaks he always advances and retreats con-
tinuously within a space of a square yard or so.
He is quite unceremonious, and his continuous
bursts of laughter, rapid talk, and restless move-
ments utterly disconcerted Morley and every
other London “big bug” who had to deal with
him in his early days in theP.M.G. When he
talks as a journalist, he is always interesting
and to the point. When he talks as a sort of lay
minister, he is a different man, and the arch-
angels wink at one another with their off eyes.
There is nothing great about him, not a touch of
genius, not a trace of a real personality ; but he
has an admirably nimble and wiry talent and an
amount of “go” that is phenomenal. His next
big appearance will probably be as editor of a new
daily.
It was at the second time of asking that
Miss Mitchell (Madame Melba) accepted
“ Charley ” Armstrong, whilst on a visit to some
friends at Mackay (Q.) They spent their honey-
moon in Sydney and Melbourne, and then went
up North with the idea of residing on a selection
at Plane Creek, purchased for them by Contractor
Mitchell, Madame’s pa. Charley, however, did
not take kindly to the idea of bullocking on a
selection, and the bride being a welcome visitor at
most places on account of her music, the pair
spent several months at various houses. Shortly
after her marriage Mrs. Armstrong successfully
arranged a concert in Mackay, and it was then
prophesied she would make her mark on the stage.
Appearances on the Melbourne and Sydney con-
cert platform preceded a trip to Europe for study,
and her subsequent career up to the present
divorce proceedings is too well known to require
recapitulation.
It is no simple matter to state in terms at
all precise what forces are directly connected with
the production of hale and happy old age. More
certainly is involved in the process than mere
strength of constitution. Healthy surroundings,
contentment and active, temperate and regular
habits are most valuable aids. Hard work so
long at least as it is not carried beyond the limit
neccessary to permit of the timely repair of worn
tissues, is not only harmless but a conducive
circumstance. It is, in fact, by living as far as
possible a life in accordance with natural law that
we may expect to reap the appropriate result in
its prolongation. Great care should be taken to
protect the system against the changes which
disease makes therein ; coming misery casts its
shadows before it and intimates its approach by
various signs, as a feeling of general weakness,
neuralgic pains, nervous headaches and rising of
sour wind from the stomach, backache and lum-
bago, failure of virility and gradual diminution of
mental power and similar symptoms, all tend to
show that general debility is increasing in the
patient’s system. Such persons should take notice
of the experience of Mrs. 0. Whittington, 11
Coventry Place, South Melbourne, who for some
years was afflicted with excessive nervous prostra-
tion, and who writes: —“I have been suffering
over four years with noises in my head, caused by
a fright a few days after confinement. During
the whole of this time the least excitement would
make me very nervous, and it was with great
difficulty that I could do my household work, and
have scarcely ever had a proper night’s rest, being
continually disturbed with terrible dreams. I
tried many remedies and was also under- medical
treatment, but nothing did any good until a friend
recommended Clements Tonic. I took a large
bottle and have much pleasure in testifying to the
good it has done me; the noises in my head are
removed and I can rest at night now, and am fully
convinced that Clements Tonic does all that is
claimed for it, and I recommend it to all I come
in contact with, suffering as I have done.”
Clements Tonic is sold everywhere. Offices and
I aboratories, 212 A’Beckett-street, Melbourne and
at Sydney.

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
.at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St,
James Chambers, King-street, Sydney.
Society
Part of the great Berry (or Berry great)
estate at Shoalhaven, N.S.W., is to be auctioned
almost immediately. Fifteen-thousand acres are
to be placed on the market, and they are expected
to realise at least £3O per acre, or P'300,000.
There {are about 90,000 acres in the estate, all
averaging about the same value as the 15,000
about to be sold. Just tot it up and note the

Dear Bulletin, —There is in Australia a
gigantic monopoly, in whose service espionage
and oppression reign supreme. No man is safe;
each distrusts his neighbour. “ Spotters ” follow
the individual employe, and these “ spotters ’ are
themselves often shadowed in turn. Even the aid
of women is requisitioned, in order to report on
the movements of the men. These women try
their best to engage the men in conversation, and-
when they succeed the men are instantly dis-
missed. Such are the subtlety and unscrupulous-
ness of this Mafian system, which condemns to
misery the workmen whose souls it owns. But
bread must be got. —Socialist.

The true history of the late Adelaide
bank-note forgeries, which up to now remain
unpunished. The two partners in the transaction
had the forgeries all ready by Wednesday, Nov.
4th, their total value amounting to £5OOO. It
was agreed between them that they should com-
mence putting the fictitious notes into circulation
on the following Saturday afternoon, Nov. 7th,
and as they would have all that half-day, the
following Sunday, and Monday, i.e., Prince of
Wales’ Birthday, wherein to dispose of them, they
would have ample time in which to realize the lot
and clear on Monday evening before the bank
would discover the frauds. It happened, how-
ever, that one of the criminals got drunk, in the
absence of his mate, and started passing his share
of the notes on Thursday—two days earlier than
agreed upon. Then the other man took fright
and followed suit. Hence the small percentage
of victimized citizens. Now, the detectives know
nothing about this simply because, they never
know anything unless—(l), a criminal’s girl gives
him away; (2), his letters are intercepted ; or (3),
a photo of himself is extant, which enables the
officer to run him to earth. If a criminal, pre-
viously unknown to the police, commits an offence
and has no Judas Iscariot accomplice, nor lays
himself open to capture by any of the three above-
mentioned devices, in 99 cases out of 100 he will
escape scot-free.

The present “ unfinancial ” condition of
one or two titled Southern citizens is a miserable
satire upon the “ handles ” they wear as mementoes
of their vanished wealth. A “Sir,” bestowed
upon a man in recognition of his - reputed riches,
becomes a ghastly suit of distinction for him to
go to bed with when the cash account has run
dry, and his former greatness has dwindled away
in “ cronk ” land speculations. Bereft of his one
solitary excuse for possessing a title the bloated
dead-broker realises for the first time that it
advertises his fall as vehemently as it announced
his rise. Visions of gigantic headlines in the
hevenin’ papers—“lnsolvency of Thingummy
Diddler —A Knight in Pawn ” —haunt his slum-
bers, and it is necessary to lock the bedroom door
of this exploded delusion on the outside, lest he
should walk forth in his sleep and request his
principal mortgagees to go “odd man” for the
darned “ Sir” which they have, strictly speaking,
bought up between them.

The other day, while walking in King-

camera at hand. A man engaged in the criminal
act of selling tote-tickets was in friendly converse
with a uniformed policeman, and had in his right
hand, which was (purely as a matter of form)
kept behind his back, a book of tickets. Pre-
sently a man came along who wanted a ticket,
and tugged at the vendor’s hand. Whereupon the
policeman (who had been put on no doubt to
watch the tote-proprietors) obligingly turned his
back on the pair and looked into a shop-window
during the progress of the nefarious negotiations.

there should be so great a difference between the

know, but will suggest as a reason that the Dis-
trict Court Judges, being brought directly into
contact with the mass of the people, have not
learnt to set themselves up on pedestals. Mr.
Acting-Justice Murray’s conduct while in his pre-
sent position has given so much public satisfaction
that there is a widespread hope he will be per-
manently appointed to the Supreme Court bench ;
and people will not be sorry to see Judge Back-

The story goes that some time ago a few

were recognised by the Co. as the official orchestra.
The band, at the request of their genial masters,
played every Saturday afternoon and two evenings
per week on St. Kilda beach, in order to help the
line traffic. They asked for extra pay, and were,
placated with the promise of 12s. Cd. per week for
band services during the 1891 season ! On the
opening of the season, the other day, the band
reminded the manager of the promise, and were
told that their services, if any, would have to be
gratuitous. Dour men who refused to toot with-
out remuneration were “ sacked.’

Dear Bulletin, —Be a recent article of
yours anent the privilege (?) now offered to young
Australians of enlisting on the ships of the Aus-
tralian squadron, few people seem to realise what
Jack’s life afloat means. When visitors go about
the vessels in the harbour and partake of a nice
tea with the hospitable sailors and sit on com-
fortable and clean benches with perhaps musical
accessories to promote digestion, it never occurs to
them that these very teas are paid for out of poor
Jack’s private purse. A man-o’-wars man’s wages
are so carefully curtailed that it is only by. exer-
cising the strictest economy that he can save
enough to purchase for himself sufficient “extras”
to enable him to make a meal off the ordinary
ship’s rations — i.e., bread and pork or salt meat—
and keep his clothes or “ kit ” presentable. When
a recruit joins £lO is deducted by instalments
from his pay for his clothes, and he has henceforth
to replenish his store whenever his garments
become shabby. A deserter at present in gaol for
his third attempted escape asserts that his present
fare is infinitely superior to what he received when
on board, and that not only is the work easier, but
also the personal treatment received at the hands
of his superiors is infinitely better ! As far as he
is concerned he doesn’t care how much longer he
remains in gaol as he is better off now than lie has
been for a long time. His only fear is lest he may
have to return to his ship instead of being expelled
from Her Gracious’ service. Deadbeats and green
youngsters are the only volunteers now for the
navy. Can anything more denunciatory be ex-
pressed than this? Are you attending, Young
Australia?—Yours, kc., Ohas. Junor.

to serve for three years under existing regulations
“ together with any that may be made in the
future.” The Coalition Artillery Government
called for “volunteers” to go out against the
shearers. Many D.F. men did not so volunteer,
since to absent themselves from Brisbane would
have meant, in their cases, either the closure of
their small shops or businesses, or dismissal by
their employers. Now they are being cheated out
of their deferred pay under a “new regulation.”

A Melbourne paper tells a weird story of
the adventures of one of the depositors in the
fallen Metropolitan Bank. He had heal’d rumours
of the approaching collapse, and fled in terror into
the city to withdraw his deposit of £3OO. The
teller met him with an affable smile, and paid him
in the bank’s own notes —if he had asked for gold
the establishment would have closed there and
then —and he went on his way rejoicing. He had
got about two miles on the road home when the
horrible thought occurred to him that if the
Metropolitan burst the Metropolitan notes were
just as valuable as brown wrapping-paper. There
was no time to get back before closing time, so he
rushed into the nearest branch bank and tried to
open an account with the alleged assets. But
the branch blandly declined them, and he was
left standing dismally in the street with £3OO of
valueless notes in his palsied hknd. Then he
started to get rid of them systematically. He
plodded round from one shop to another buying
sixpenny worths of anything and everything, and
taking 19s. fid. change on each transaction. He
bought tobacco, pipes, pills, quinine, jumping-
jacks, apples, bananas, tarts, buttons, eggs,
cheese, bootlaces, beer, dolls, tooth-brushes, and
all manner of things. When he got loaded down
he either hired a light porter to take the rubbish
home or else threw them in the gutter. And finally,
about midnight, he tottered home himself, worn
to rags, dusty, almost speechless, and with the
soles walked off his boots, but triumphantly hump-
ing £292 10s. of small change in a hired barrow.
Next day the bank closed up.

Mr. Abraham Friedman, one of Sydney’s
chief “financiers,” last week had a meeting of
his creditors. His statement of affairs shows a
large surplus of assets. Old Friedman was
originally a jewellery hawker, and afterwards,
in turns, draper, pawnbroker, financier, and
“ banker.” Over-speculation in land has been the
primary cause of his downfall, and discounting
bills for impecunious politicians may be set down
as a secondary factor. It was pressure from
Friedman that made Sir Henry Parkes seek
refuge in an assignment for the benefit of his
creditors on the last occasion that the Hairy Bis-
marck got into pecuniary troubles.

for it. Between the two alternatives of building
a new Post-office to suit the clock, or buying a

it wouldn’t matter to her whether she lost the

the form from mere force of habit. Unluckily for
him, however, it turned out that his name would
have to go on the bond, simply because the lady
was his wife—in other words, he would have to go

would be dead and lose his money at the same

forfeit his cash just when he wanted it to pay a
doctor with, and if he couldn’t pay he would pro-
bably be put in gaol for debt, while the lady who
had maimed him would be going about joyfully in
sweet freedom outside. Mr. Nelson looked at the
matter all round, and asked what good this par-

“A rather extraordinary and uncommon motion was moved in the Camperdown Council at
its last meeting by Alderman Sparkes. It read thus: —That the advisability of a self-denial
of one fortnight during Christmas be urged upon the ratepayers for the purpose of relieving
the debt of the borough. Alderman Sparkes thought as they wanted money, and as General
Booth by a somewhat similar method had raised £10,000 in the provinces, this would be a good
way to reduce their indebtedness. Alderman Porter seconded. Alderman Cahill thought he
might be inclined to support the motion if it were postponed till after Christmas, but he
could not forego his Christmas cheer. He moved that it be postponed. The Mayor and
Alderman Abigail also opposed the motion, which was eventually lost.” —Sydney Daily Paper.

What a nice set of people, remarks our
correspondent, you can meet in “ sassiety ’ in
England ! How pleasant, for instance, it must
be to spend a week or so in a country house with
the young married lady “who moves in the
highest circles,” who recently walked off with
jewels to the value of <£Boo, the property of the
lady whose guest she was at Torquay, and sold
them for £5OO to Spink, the well-known jeweller !
The jewels were missed and a notice of their loss
published. Spink saw it and honestly communi-
cated with the owner. He described the lady from
whom he bought them, and on a photograph being
shown him he at once identified her. The owner
of the jewels sued Spink for the recovery of the
gems, and succeeded, but she declines to prosecute
the person who stole them “for fear of creating a
great scandal.” So Spink is left out in the cold,
and has not even the satisfaction of knowing that
a mean thief has been punished. Had a chamber-
maid been the larcenist she would have got two or
three years’imprisonment. This is a case, if ever
there was one, which the public prosecutor should
take up. The decision against the jeweller quite
upsets all the old cases in which it is laid down
that anything purchased honestly by a trader in
“ market overt ” cannot be reclaimed.

There are two books on the Marriage

Circular sent to nearly every clerk and

To shave the muzzle of even a possible
church-goer on Sunday is not a work of necessity
or charity. The production of a paper on the

The recent additions and alterations to the
house provided by N.S.W. Government for the
British Admiral of the station cost about £B5OO.
A wool-and-hide store having since been built
right alongside the Admiral’s residence the place
will shortly be uninhabitable to anyone with a

Lady Onslow’s special claim to affection is
having tried to persuade the Dunedin factory
girls to come and dance with the men-o’-war’s-
men, those foreign English tomcats, at the
Dunedin Exhibition. Butthecommongirlsgaveher
a lesson in their reply, which had to be fumigated
and fustigated with an ounce of civet, good
apothecary, before it was fit for her ladyship’s
pince-nez.

The eight-hour system was inaugurated in
Perth, W. A., on 2nd December by a successful
demonstration. The cause of unionism is strongly
growing in that backward province, but many of
the large employers still work their men as they
choose. The Government set its face against
unionism and declined to make the demonstration
day a holiday ; also, the city storekeepers refused
to close their shops.
The Sydney air is full of libel-actions.
Australian Star has lately had to defend some
more or less trumpery ones which must have cost
much money, and there are numberless writs out
in all directions. One paper lias six writs in its
office.

The N.S.W. Full Court’s decision in the
late big nullity of marriage case endorses the
proposition that marriage is a failure. The parties
were married first over a broomstick, secondly in
the English Church, thirdly in the R.O. Church,
yet no ceremony of the three constitutes holy
matrimony.

This is the most shallow advertising fraud we ever
saw. Fancy a medico advertising for love. Has
he no lady patients? has he (unlike all other
bachelor medicoes) no sweet young thing to answer
his door, and dance attendance? We shall next
have Cardinal Moran advertising that he wants a
Douay Bible and a woman who will believe what
his riverence tells her.

The first points noticeable to a stranger in

The increasing defectiveness of eyesight in
the present generation is attributable mainly to
the intensity and duration of artificial light. Note-
how tired the eyes become after quitting the
theatre or a prolonged stay where the electric-
light is consumed. Add to this the glare of our
daily semi-tropical sun and the prevalence of
smoking among both sexes and it becomes a
matter of wonder that Australians are able to sec
their friends’ wives even across the street.
Two orphan girls, whose father recently
left them .£6OO, joyfully invested all their money

Pen-picture of Brisbane : —Scores of empty
shops in the main street; bars and billiard-rooms
silent and vacant; visiting bushmen surrounded
by swarming cadgers ; bailiffs and debt-collectors
undisputed monarchs of the hour ; heat and still-
ness overpowering; Ministers of the Crown either
absent on tour or skulking in back alleys; even
Governor Norman, when he does venture outside
Government House grounds, takes the secluded
small streets for his peregrinations.

In a wife-maintenance case, heard at the
Sydney Quarter Sessions Appeal Court the other
day, the lesser half swore that she was married
much under age, and that to appease Conscience,

declare she was “ over 21!”

Custom-house Agent Molesworth, M.L.A.

Is Reid a Single-taxer? A thousand times no.

At this Xmas season we have much
pleasure in directing the attention of those con-
cerned to the magnificent show-rooms of W.
Mammatt and Sons, situated at Empire Cham-
bers, 93 York-street, where are displayed in
pleasing variety a splendid lot of electro-plated
goods just the thing for Xmas and New Year
presents. Each article is of the very best
quality, elegant and tasteful in design, and at the
same time of a most useful character. W. Mam-
matt and Sons being manufacturers are enabled to
carry a large assorted stock of everything that is
made in the trade; such stock being constantly
maintained by weekly shipments received direct
from their large Sheffield works. The firm is so
well-known for the high-class character of its
manufactures that we need only remind those who
have not yet paid a visit to its show-rooms to
do so at once.
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man —imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh,
proprietor, late of the Occidental Hotel, San

(gOMETHING GONE WRONG.
If you had been wet through, as you probably
have been at some time or other, and if you have
awoke in the morning with a feeling that nothing
could tempt you to get up, not even though you
knew it was your wedding day and the bride was
even then being prepared for the sacrifice, you
may depend upon it that something has gone
wrong somewhere. If you use St. Jacobs oil
promptly and vigorously you may escape with
nothing more serious than a cold, and even that
will be in a mild form; but if you think you know
better than the thousands who urge you to use
it on account of its wonderful efficacy in their own
cases, then by all means lay yourself out for the
attack of rheumatism, neuralgia, sciatica, or some
kindred demoniacal torture and welcome. But
don’t afterward pretend that you didn’t know any
better. St. Jacobs oil is not a quack remedy.
Every application gives relief.
Every bottle contains a cure.
Every bottle tested as to quality.
Every genuine bottle bears the firm’s signature.
Every home in N.S.W. knows its value.
Every spoken language knows its name.
Every journal of the land praises it.
Every household shelf should have it.
Every testimonial strictly true.
Every day increased demands.
Every patient is amazed and cured.
Every ache or pain succumbs.
Every druggist knows its merits.
Every chemist finds it perfect.
•## The proprietors of St. Jacobs oil are sincere
and positive in all they allege in regard to its
virtues, and have offered large rewards for proof
showing that any testimonials published by them
are not genuine.
May be obtained from all storekeepers.

PRACTICAL OPINION.
THE AGENT OF THE WATERBURY
WATCH CO.
Sir, —As I have carried a Waterbury Watch
for several years, and it has proven a most reliable
timepiece, I trust it will not be out of place for
me to express my opinion concerning the well-
known watches. lam a teacher and could not
satisfactorily use .a watch which could not be
depended upon for correct time and durability.
I have used at different times several other
watches of different manufacture, but have fre-
quently returned them for the best of reasons—
they would not run. Finally, my father (A. O.
Prescott, jeweller, of Chatepaigay, N.Y.) obtained
for me a Waterbury, “series J’’ (short wind),
saying he knew from experience that would give
satisfaction in every way, and it has. The watch
has not had the best of care,T confess ; yet it is,
without exception, the best timepiece I have seen.
I have no desire to exchange it for any other.
Very sincerely,

now.
A sturdy roadster that had just carried a
man through the journey from Isormanton, Gulf
of Carpentaria, to Brisbane, was put up for
auction, together with riding gear, the other day
at Brisbane saleyards. The saddle fetched 15s. ;
the bridle, 2s. (id.; and the moke one shilling !
At Foxton, Maoriland. quite recently, a

consent is 14 years, while the Social Purity
Society & Co. want it raised to lb years.

“Ninian Melville, Esq., has almost the
lion’s share of the inscription on the Searle Memorial in
the Parramatta River. The monument was not erected
to record the fact that “ Ninian Melville, Esq., M.P.,” was
pitchforked into the position of “Chairman of Committees
of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales,” but to
record the sculling championship of an Australian youth.
Is it too late now to remove the offensive portion of the
inscription? Who associated the brilliant record of the
dead sculler with the political record of the ex-undertaker?
The writer intends this inscription shall be carved on his
tombstone: —“John Smith, miserable sinner, buried by
Ninian Melville, Esq., M.P., etc., etc.”

Matt O’Shanassy has bought, at a stiffish price,
one of the best weight-carrying hacks in England, and if
the animal passes the Vet’s examination people will see in
Melbourne the sort of horse-flesh they can raise in the
Bull country. It takes a good ’un to carry the stalwart
Mat.

I often think, writes our London correspondent,
of what Frank Hewitt, the pedestrian, once said to me.
In course of conversation I remarked to him that I was
astonished that he was always wishing to go back to
England. “ Surely,” I said, “ you can do better here?
Consider how many sharps there are at your game in
England.” “ That’s true,” was his reply, “ but see how
many flats there are to keep the sharps going.” There
was philosophy in this, with fact to back it.

Joe Thompson, writes onr English correspon-
dent, is intensely unpopular amongst his betting con-
freres. This is in a measure to be accounted for by the
fact of his having come so suddenly to the front as a
dealer in big figures, but he has never really been a
favourite at the clubs. When he came to England first
he used to give mortal offence to men like Fry by taking
bets, as it were, out of their mouths. Suppose a backer
came up and asked a price which the bookey would not
wager, Joe would at once chip in and say, “ I’ll lay it to
you.” This conduct is against the “honour among
thieves” principle acted upon by the metallicians. Every
big wager which Joe lays now is watched, and followed
by the comment “ the man’s mad “he must be off ’e’s
'ed;” “is he going to go broke?” &c., &c. Of course,
malice has a good deal to do with these observations,
which are generally made coram populo, but at the same
time Joe would be wise to follow the example of caution
set by men who have bought their experience. If he con-
tinues to lay big prices to large sums to “professional
backers,” as they are called, such as Tom Wilson and
others, he will find that it is not a very profitable game.
These men are marvellously clever, and it is astonishing
what accurate information they possess about almost
every stable in the country. When they put down the
money in earnest they are pretty sure to pick it up again
with interest in the long run ; and one is almost tempted
to believe that the Jockey Club has not yet succeeded in
getting to the bottom of turf mysteries, which have so
puzzled people. Stable secrets leak out just as freely as
of yore, and owners are constantly forestalled in the most
wonderful way. It is only the Irish division that can
cope with these gentry, and when the Hibernians do set
themselves to plan a coup they are not often wrong.
These are the boys that Joe will have to keep his eye on
If he wishes to keep his balance at the B. of N.S.W.
intact.

There was an enormous attendance at the
settling on Monday after the Cambridgeshire, for it was
rumoured that “Joe Thompson was going to do some-
thing.” That “ something ” was to carry out his declared
intention of posting the names, gentle or simple, who
had not come up to the scratch with him. As it generally
happens that many of the young swells who punt so
heavily are backward in their settling after a bad week,
there was great curiosity as to whether Joe would have
the pluck to post Lord this and the Earl of that. It
would have been an unusual proceeding, for it is
quite understood in betting circles that these foolish
youn»- people will sooner or later pay up. Had Joe
adopted this unusual method of making people pay, he
would have been marked as a man not to be betted with.
Probably mature consideration of the possible effect of
his threatened action induced the leviathan to think
again before publicly disgracing his clients, for when
Monday came Joe was as mild as buttermilk, and no
names appeared on the blackboard. It is possible that
some of those whose consciences pricked them paid up
for fear of an expose, and this may have mollified the
great man. Anyhow, the settling passed of without
any incident. Certain it is that the mere threat of post-
ing defaulters has made Joe a marked man, and he will
find it interfere very materially with his business in the
future, as people begin to say “ it is all very well for this
man to come here with his new Australian methods, but
they won’t do here.” It is certainly hard upon book-
makers to have to pay up every Monday whilst they have
often to wait a long time before their clients pay
up - but that is one of the few risks of a very profitable
business and most of the Johnnies whose names are
perpetually on the wrong side of the ledger accept
false prices from their creditors, and, no doubt, although
the world may not know it, they as often as not pay high
terms tor the privilege of gaining time.

In the late Sydney cricket-match, Shaw, the
English umpire, granted 11 out of 13 appeals by the
English bowlers, but only 2 out of 8 from Turner & Co.
Comparisons are always odorous.
If Moses made a mistake in the match afore-
said, it was in not giving bowler Turner a rest for three
or four overs during the second innings of the English-
men. One of the amusing incidents of the contest was
that prior to going in, Charlton was holding forth very
strongly on the fineness of the English umpire’s decisions.
When his turn came, before he could make a run, Shaw
gave him out l.b.w.
# * *
Several scribes, employed on sporting journals,
also carry on business as private tipsters. This is either
foolish or dishonest. For instance, if they act honourably
towards the newspapers, anyone can have their tips and
opinions for a few pence. Yet they call on clients to
send five guineas for the season, or ten shillings a day
with an extra for paddock finals.
» * *
The sporting tipster, the man who on receipt of
a few shillings can give valuable information calculated
to win fortunes, has of late been very much in evidence
in the advertising columns of the sporting papers. Tub
Bulletin wants to know why these fellows do not make
their fortunes by backing their own tips instead of send
jng their “ good things” to outsiders for a few shillings
The game has been played out in England. Rapier
exposed it years ago, and even John Corlett will not
allow tipsters to advertise in his own papers.

Britisher Attewell’s bowling is little better than
a throw. Old-timers will recollect that Mr. Dave
Gregory used to “ shy the ball, and his style caused no
end of controversy and bickerings in cricketing circles.
It was on the first day of the historic three days’ single
wicket match on the Albert Ground, between \vilhs,
Conway and Cosstiok, and the brothers “Ned." “Dave
and ‘ ‘ Charley ” Gregory, that Nat Thompson was standing
umpire, and no-balled Dave for three consecutive balls,
when Dave went off and Ned did the bowling. Next day
Dave came on to bowl, and as he came up to the crease
to deliver his first ball, Nat Thompson cried “No ball,
but Dave did not allow the ball to leave his hand, ana
appealed that the umpire had come on the ground with
his mind made up to no-ball him, and asked for his
removal. This was allowed, and another umpire put on
n Thompson’s place.
* * *
It is a melancholy fact that the Victorian
Cricketers’ Association has carried a resolution in favour
of having umpires for intercolonial matches provided by
the non-contesting colony. A man who, by this rule,
can’t be trusted to give hpnest decisions in any game
where his own people are interested, will be specially
appointed to look after the interests of strangers. Shef-
field's protest that all umpires are for “ the game,” and
none for a particular side, is altogether too fresh and
wholesome for the Y.C.A., which is apparently trying to
bring cricket down to the level of local football.

The English Eleven have two instructions from

Jockey slaughter comes on the tapis again, with
the Richmond races (Melb.), the other day 7. Butchered
to make a Roman holiday—why, we have it at every 7
meeting, and in Richmond there came two slaughterous
races, one after the other, which actually 7 did go the
length of satiating the people with blood. Now 7 , you
know, there is nothing of this kind in England—quite
rare even for jockeys to be injured ; and as for one being
killed—why, it would send a thrill all through the
country.

London Referee, discussing a forthcoming

of touts and bookmakers alw 7 ays reminds one of Charles
Dickens’ regret that an animal so noble as the horse
should have a demoralising influence upon men who live
too much in its company.

£2 and costs for cruelty to his mount, Sylvia 11., at Sher-

Lord Jersey is imbued with the old English
prejudices, evidently. He invited the “ amateur mem-

but airily ignored the “ professionals.” Among the so-
called amateurs was W. G. Grace, a big man who lives by
and on the game and who gets paid as much for his
services as all the professionals of the team put together.
Moreover, the “ gentlemen ” stay at the Australia, the

Champion sculler Jim Stanbury has no notion
of taking on the young Aucklander, Tom Sullivan, and
says that it is more than likely that he will go to America
and give O’Connor first chance at the championship as he
promised him he would after he had rowed M‘Lean a
second time. Stanbury adds that when he was fit and
well Sullivan’s crowd wanted to be laid £lOOO to £3OO.
When they thought they had him out of condition they
offered to row for £2OO level. Now the champion says
“ it’s my turn to keep them waiting. It would cost me
£lOO to train, and £2OO a-side leaves me nothing for my
win.” Stanbury is not so utterly unfit as some of the
papers would have us believe, as he has done five weeks’
hard work with Lambert, and was nearly down to weight
when that lad defeated Bnbear the .other day. It really
seems as if Stanbury and his friends feared the young
Maorilander.
Dear Bulletin, —Premier Munro’s Parlia-
mentary influence has _ got by the
building societies authorised by the Legislature.
The societies lent out deposit-money (placed
with them at call) for a long period, so
that it could not be repaid at call. 1 hen
the societies got an Act of Parliament rushed
through without anybody having time to think of
the consequences, locking up the money from the
depositor. Of course every other financial insti-
tution with money at call will be entitled to the
same relief. When you give your money to the
middleman, he is to hold it as long as he likes.
All this merely to bolster up 10 per cent, divi-
dends. Why was not this relief given to poor
little Mirams, and the Premier Permanent?
Because he had no Parliamentary influence.—D.
Dear Bulletin,— jKe your paragraph anent
M‘Gooey, the naturalist, and Rolf Boldrewood’s
eels in Riverine waters, the question is (some of
your contributors may be able to answer) whether
honours are not divided ? It is an article of faith
amongst travelled bushrnen that eels are only
found in Eastern waters and cod-fish in Western.
To this rule there is the usual exception, In the
Logan and Albert rivers in South Queensland
cod-fish are, or were, comparatively plentiful, a
fact which any of the old residents of Tamrookum,
Beaudesert, Telemon, or Tabragalba can substan-
tiate. This is the one exception so far as the
Eastern coast is concerned, and the mystery is
how they came there. I have heard that eels
have been caught in Western waters—that is to
say, waters belonging to the Murray and Darling
system, but personally, I cannot vouch for the
fact. Perhaps soine of your many readers may
be able to do so. I should not be surprised if it
were so. At any rate, lam astonished at an old
bushman like Rolf B. going against such an
accepted bush tradition as “eels in Eastern—ood
in Western waters,” unless he had good authority
for doing so, — Deloomtn.
Parkes boasts that he helped to lay the
foundation of the N.S.W. Constitution; but he
is silent on the part he played in fastening plural-
voting upon the province.
The Standai’d Bank of Australia (Melb.)
which closed for “repairs” last week, is one of
the very few land-boom financial creations that
has out-lived the bad good times.
The Australian Star (Sydney) is urged
to come out as a protectionist morning paper;
but the management does not like the idea of
leaving the field to the freetrade Evening News.
The N.S.W. Executive has, “aftermature
consideration,” commuted to life-imprisonment
the death-sentence on wife-murderer Williams,
the lunatic. Five minutes after finding the man
guilty (while admitting his madness !) the jurors
signed a petition for mercy.
Fact of interest to printers. Sam Cook,
of S.M. Herald, has introduced a new system
into the economy of his printing-office. His com-
positors now have to do all their own corrections
at their own cost, and to counterbalance this
every setter of an absolutely clean “take”
receives a bonus in the form of two minutes’
allowance. The result is that the “ literals ”in
the first proofs do not average two per galley !

A Summer Midnight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Athwart the star-lit midnight sky
Luminous fleecy clouds drift by,
As the mysterious, pallid moon
Sinks in the waveless still lagoon.
Now that the queen of night is dead,
The starry commonwealth o’erhead
(Softer and fairer than gaudy day)
Sheds lustrous light from the Milky Way ;
While the Dog-star gleams, and the Sisters Seven,
Float tremulously in the misty heaven.
Faintly, afar the horse-bells ring ;
Myriads of wakened crickets sing;
And the spirit-voices of the night
Sing snatches of fairy music bright,
Old-world melodies—lang syne sung—
Recalling days when the heart was young,
Whose wonderful cadences fall and rise,
As the wind in the casuarina sighs ;
And the world seems ’gulfed, this summer night,
In a flood of delicious, dreamy light.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuxi-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties fiom
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-

TO PREVENT BUR G L A RIE S.—A
“Pyramid ” Night Light should be lighted in the

Housebreakers have the greatest dread of a light.

South Australia is now the only country
in the world that has gained the first five points
of the People’s Charter. An instalment of

Those N.S.W. Labour members who sup-
ported Dibbs as against Reid were the men in the
party' who have always been staunch friends to
trades-unionism and to the workers—men like ex-
President Sharp, ex-Secretary Houghton, ex-
ambassador Fitzgerald ; also, ex-workers Gann,
Johnston and Murphy, whose hands are yet tool-
blistered ; while those alleged Labour members
who supported Reid were-well, read the list and

Recently the St. Helena (Q.) strike
prisoners were interviewed by two members of the
democratic party, who informed them that release
was contingent on the prisoners signing a petition
for release. Meston said he would forward the
men such a form as could not be objected to and
that it would still be effective. Evidently the
visitors were the unwitting catspaws of the
Cabinet. The prisoners, however (well advised by
their own wits or by friends outside), blankly
refused to assist George IV. & Cos. to get their
white elephant off their hands before the
general election. Tozer’s little pot of luck
looks bad for filling again. Only four of
“ the swells ” voted in the Assembly for
the strikers’ release. The Cabinet have in-
timated that they intend no release until labour
absolves the soldiering and Judge Jeffreyism of
the Government by viea culpas. Only Labour
representation can keep Queensland from being
smashed into smithereens by the nabobs who
shriek for black, brown, yellow, and mean white
cheap labour.

The great difficulty experienced by
musicians in obtaining in Sydney pianos from
the far-famed house of Broad wood, has led to the
formation of the British Pianoforte Dep6t at
335 a George-street. Here, Mr. George E. Voung,
manager for the firjl, shows in a beautifully com-
modious room, instruments with which few others
can vie. It is a well-known fact that for 159
years the Broad wood pianos have been the pride
of all true musicians, indeed the name of Broad-
wood is a household word both at home and
abroad. Durability is one of the strong points of
the Broadwood pianofortes. When purchasers
are tempted to buy an inferior instrument of com-
paratively unknown make by reason of its showy
exterior, they should remember that, in all pro-
bability after the lapse of a few years, anew
piano will be needed in the house. Now a
Broadwood, even of the cheapest kind, will last a
generation—during Sir Charles Halle’s recent
visit to Sydney he used none but the fine Broad-
wood grand, which is now on view at the British
pianoforte deprit, and he has often been heard to
declare that he has vised the Broadwood both in
public and private for the last 42 years, and pre-
fers them to any other. The writer of this para-
graph can from experience of the almost
insuperable difficulty in obtaining a Broadwood
piano in Sydney some years ago. It was only by
the merest chance one of these charming instru-
ments was met with, and although ten years
since, the tone is, if anything, clearer and fuller
than when it Was new.

Mr, Lawler, of Lawler’s furniture ware-
house, George-street, has just returned from
America, and has brought along with him some
exquisite rattan furniture. A charming suite is
enamelled in white and gold, whilst another is in
pink and white. The shapes of the chairs and
settees are quite novel, and it is not too much to
say that more beautiful furniture cannot be seen
in Sydney. It is most suitable to this climate.
Mr. Lawler also shows a large variety of colonial-
made wicker suites, but, although excellently
made, they lack the finish of the American
goods. The excellence of the beds and bedding
is evident at a glance, and housekeepers will
be interested to know that curtains and hangings
of all descriptions are always kept in stock.
Another speciality here is a wonderful show of
sideboards, to suit either the cottage or mansion.
The prices are amazingly low—for instance, a
handsome large cedar one, with centre and side
mirrors, for <£9.

A good, commodious, hair-dressing room
for ladies has been a long-felt want in Sydney.
It is a want no longer, for Messrs. Smith and
Elsinger have opened a saloon in George-street,
nearly opposite Nicholson’s Music Warehouse.
By stepping upstairs ladies find themselves in a
lofty and airy room replete with comfortable
lounges, &c., and instead of being compelled to
stare at blank walls whilst waiting their turn, the
fair sex have an excellent view of all that is going
on below in George-street. This, of course, makes
the time spent at the hairdresser’s a pleasure
indeed. Add to this, few can compete with
Messrs. Smith and Elsinger in their mode of hair-
dressing. Making up hair-combings and fringes
is ahofcheSf/Uino at this establishment, and lady
patrohs Can be certain of meeting hero with the
best o£*aJMxmtion and the utmost civility.
We have inspected the handsome estab-
lishment of Mr. TANARUS, F. Wiesener, the well-known
and old-established jeweller and optician of 334
: George-street. The premises, which have recently
been rebuilt, deservedly rank amongst the finest in
ourcity. Amongst the-numerous handsome arid
curious articles that attracted our attention we
noticed some Chilian opals, also coloured pearls,
pink,-black, silver grey, opalescent, &c. Mr. W.
has also a large arid varied assortment of watches,-
clocks, and time-pieces of every description to
suit the moat fastidious taste, and prices to suit
all pockets. There is a choice selection of other
jewellery of every description, Wedding, birth-
day, Christmas, and New Year gifts, suitable for
either ladies or gentlemen. Amongst the latter we
noticed silver and gold match-boxes, cigar and
cigarette cases, cigar-cutters, moustache combs,
sovereign purses,- compendiurns, also some very
handsome pocket-books, purses and card-cases in
Kussia leather, crocodile and lizard skins, mounted
with gold and silver clasps and corners. The
extent and variety of scientific instruments is
bewildering to the uninitiated. Microscopes of
every conceivable pattern from the simple appli-
ance suitable for a school-boy to the elaborate in-
strument of the medical man, collected from all
the principal workshops of England and the con-
tinent, thermometers, E.P. ware, and an endless
variety of optical appliances. We also inspected
the extensive workshops connected with the
premises, but want of space prevents us giving a
full description of them here. We may state
that all Mr. Wiesener’s goods were imported
before the Protectionist tariff came in force and
are offered to the public free of duty.

It is passing sad to think how many hun-
dreds of poor cripples are dragging out their
weary existence through ignorance of the fact that
their complaints could be permanently cured by
the Massage treatment. Paralytics, who have
been given up by the doctors, have almost invari-
ably regained their lost vigour under this magical,
though common-sense, treatment, the exceptions
being those cases which have been of such long
standing that the limbs are, to all intents and
purposes dead. Mrs. Seton, electrician and mas-
seuse, of Nithsdale, Liverpool-street, Hyde Park,
Sydney, is from the London West End Hospital
for Paralysis and Nervous Diseases, and although
her arrival in Sydney is of recent date, this skill-
ful masseuse has effected many wonderful cures of
rheumatism, sciatica, and all nervous diseases,
and is particularly successful with infantile
paralysis. No time should be lost by those
stricken with any nervous malady in trying the
massage treatment, and if that fails—nothing will
cure.

Messrs. W. H. Paling and Cos., Limited,
are by no means behindhand in their show of new
goods for the Xmas season. Amongst the novel-
ties that are showing is a duet stool, either seat of
which can be raised or lowered just by touching a
very ingenious piece of mechanism. The metal
extending stools with plush seats are also here in
great variety. This firm are sole agents for the
celebrated Steinway Pianos, and likewise for the
“Victor.” In the smaller class of instruments
everything here is obtainable, even the delightful
bag-pipes and the popular banjo, and as for music
itself all the world knows that at Paling's every-
thing that is published is obtainable. Paling's
Xmas Annual is an exceedingly good shilling's
worth, and would make a nice Xmas gift to send
to friends up country. It contains the popular
barn dance, besides a good selection of songs both
comic and sentimental. It should be mentioned
that Messrs. Paling and Cos. will sell till the New
Year all their goods free of duty.

If you would like a real good time, step
into W. H. McClellands & Cos., 94-96 King-street.
A pretty picnic sunshade is to be purchased here,
at'the trifling cost of 4s. lid. Strother’s match-
less Eau-de-cologne, also Selli Frires’ delightful
French and American Perfumery. Photo Frames
there are in great variety, hand-painted, carved
wood, &c. Ladies’ Manicure Sets, in oxidised
silver, pearl, filagree, and leather. Lap-desks
and Letter-books, in all leathers. Mirrors, too,
and Shaving-glasses. Bangles, in rolled-gold,
2s. lid., Sea Bean, each, also Alligator
Bangles. W. H. McClelland & Cos. are showing,
besides, Zeorite Belts, and Belts in jetted elastic
wire. For the little people, the firm provides
two-faced dollies —good* and naughty—the Pansy
Black-board, an appropriate gift for a baby-artist,
and which can be changed at will from an upright
to a desk position, and other novelties, too
numerous to mention. The popularity of the
Millinery department here, is illustrated by the
fact that no less than fifty trimmed hats and
bonnets are disposed of in one day.

The establishment of Messrs. Dahms and
Cos., jewellers, 168 Pitt-street, deserves, without
the slightest doubt, the earnest attention of all
Christmas purchasers. They have always been
foremost in supplying the public with the latest
and most chaste designs in everything apper-
taining to their business. This Xmas they have
simply excelled themselves, and it would be vain
to attempt a description of the hundreds and
thousands of lovely articles they display in
watches, jewellery, electro - plate and optical
goods. The public are strongly urged to visit
this establishment, where they will find an elegant
display and everything of the best quality.
Visitors may reckon on every attention and civility
from the principals and shop-assistants in Messrs.
Dahms’ establishment.

To lady equestriennes in the dog days, the
suestion of head-gear is of paramount importance,
t must comprise coolness with elegance, and
lightness with both. In the “Terai” hat just
introduced by G. H. Smith and Son, 302 George-
street, these three requisites are happily united.
Double-brimmed and crowned, the “ Terai ” is an
ideal riding-hat, and with the addition of some
slight trimming can be made as stylish as the
most exacting Di Vernon could wish.
When the eyes become weak or the lids inflamed
and sore, a scrofulous condition of the blood is
indicated. For scrofula, in all its forms, Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla is the best remedy. It invigorates
the blood and expels all humors.

The “ Denmark Universal Pills ” have become
the most Famous Herbal Remedy of the Nine-
teenth Century. It is a genuine Universal
Remedy for the whole human system, inasmuch

reconstructs a broken down Nervous System.
This remedy also removes and prevents Costive-
ness, Rheumatism, Nervous Debility, Barren-
ness, Blood Affections, Stricture, Piles, and all
Irregularities, no matter how caused.
This remedy is also a guaranteed preventative
against any complaint, and if a few of the
“Denmark Universal Pills ” were taken occa-
sionally, very few persons would get sick at all.
It is equally good for both sexes, and entirely
harmless, being made from pure herbs only.

After the Science-Lecture.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
AT THE GATE. (MAUD, Loq.):
Enjoyed it? Indeed to the fullest immensity,
Waves of dread wonder surge over my soul,
I’d never felt joy’s overwhelming intensity
Till hearing of—what’s this ? surrounding the Pole ;
And what-ye-may-call-’ems—the things astronomical,
The gigantic lizard—the what was his name?
And Pliocene mummies that squinted so comical—
’Twas utterly splendid, I’m so glad I came.
I’m so fond of science and dote on geology,
Epochs and glaciers ever so big :
I’ve bought a new book —“ Dr. Gray on Conchology ”
Which tells of the wonderful thing-a-me-jig.
I’d like to be wise and discover a “Dactyl,”
Or go out and hunt for those fishes with wings ;
I’d search and I wouldn’t give up or come back (ill
I’d found a nice fragment of what-are-those-things.
Those Mega—you know —that he called Palrezoic,
How horrid they are—what a size they must grow ;
The man who could capture one must be heroic,
Because ’twould be awfully dang’rous, you know.
These lectures arouse trancendental thought-blisses
And makes one feel learnfed and wondrous sage ;
Do call in to-morrow—we’ll talk of the whats-thises
Floating through space in the whats-er-name-Age.
W. A. S.
The Q.C. who now holds the foremost
place at the N.S.W. Bar was terribly nervous as
a junior. Now, however, he has as much “ nerve”
as all the rest of the Bar put together. Just you
ask any attorney !
A life-sized picture of Queen Victoria, by
Herkomer, is being shipped to Melbourne National
Gallery. Needless to say that though life-sized
it is not life-like and will give the lie to honest
photography.
This is the infamous way in which the S.M.
Herald speaks of the ablutions of the Governor
of Victoria :
Hillgrove, Saturday.—The Earl of Hopetoun cleaned
up to-day for the fortnight.
One can easily understand that influenza
is wiping them off by the hundred in Samoa.
Most white men feel a disposition to die on about
the sixth day of the complaint, and when a
Samoan gets to that stage he quietly turns his
face towards the setting sun and dies for the
amusement of the thing.
A Melbourne weekly is disturbed in it s
little mind, all on account of a vain pretender
having persuaded a few old women that he was
the editor. The absurdity of rising to crush this
bogus editor under the dead weight of five long
consecutive explanatory paragraphs is obvious.
They should have allowed the gentleman’s damag-
ing statement to pass unchallenged, in the pious
hope that a disgusted subscriber to the organ
would ultimately get to hear of it, and believe it,
and slaughter the wrong man in his wrath.
The ghastly story, told in a London ex-
change and republished in Australia, of the
wretched Empress who had contracted a disease
coram m to the lowest class ot Jews in Eastern
Europe, by which her hair became a living organ-
ism with an independent nervous system of its
own, does more credit to the writer's imagination
than to his medical knowledge. There is no such
disease known to medical science. There are
numbers of skin-diseases, amongst them a kind of
ringworm that attacks the roots of the hair ; but
such active principle as it possesses is of too low
an order to develop a nervous system. The para-
graph is a nice, shuddery, little yarn, that makes
you rub your hand over your bald head or go and
get your hair cut after perusal; that is all.
A Sydney evening paper, after heaping
jam upon the head of Hamilton Aide in his
literary capacity, quotes a “charming song” of
his. We subjoin a hunk
“ A thousand inoiles awoi!” We can hear them
all singing it. How on earth do such people as the
Aides get world-wide reputations as versifiers?
And why do the daily papers quote their awful
maunderings while the waste-paper baskets of
the world are available ?
You can obtain from B. Mountcastle & Sons, of
Albert-street, Brisbane, goods of a similar class to
that retailed by the leading West-end hosiers.
Evening star, that never steepest,
Watch her with thy jealous eye,
Tell her so my fond heart keepeth
Watch a thousand miles away.
