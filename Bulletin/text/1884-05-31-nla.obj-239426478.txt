A Dangerous Instrument.
The report published by the London Times,
respecting the “scene” in the House of
Commons, in which Mr. He alt, M.P., and
the; new; Speaker were principals, serves to
emphasise the belief that the cloture rules
are destined to become very formidable in-
struments against the liberty of debate, and
the equal rights of members of Parliament.
The Speaker, being the nominee of the
majority for the time being, is necessarily in
sympathy with the prevailing section in the
House, and, being assured of the effective
support of that section, has been practically
invested with despotic power to silence
members of a minority, and to permit
license of speech to^members of a majority.
• * *
Mr. Speaker Peel is an English gentleman
of a good type, and it is unlikely that a more
fair or conscientious man will ever fill the
post. Yet, nothing could have been more de-
terminedly or flagrantly one-sided than his
interference in the case in point. Mr. Healy
had been speaking with force and signifi-
cance. He had charged the Government
with connivance at the escape of the mur-
derers of Philip Maguire, the man whose
skull had been smashed in by a party
of Orangemen. He had referred to other
instances of what he characterised as
injustice. What these were specifically,
or what was his precise remarks concerning
them, we have no opportunity for judging,
as the Times suppresses this—the mest sig-
nificant portion of his speech. From the
context and from other sources, however,
we are enabled to gather that he was com-
menting in language equally of force and
pathos upon the death in prison of a young
man. The matter was one affecting the de-
partment of the Chief Secretary for Ireland,
Mr. Trevelyan, and, observing that official
at this juncture break into smiles, Mr. Healy
very naturally commented on the indecency,
saying that “ the right hon. gentleman might
laugh, it well became his callousness.”
♦ * *
Mr. Trevelyan instantly exclaimed, “It
is an absolute falsehood to say that I
laughed,” and amidst cheers and cries of
order, produced by this speech, the Speaker
rose, and proceeded to censure—Mr. Tre-
velyan? No; Mr. Hbaly, for violence of
language, and threatened to suspend the
latter member. In the irregular discussion
which ensued, the Attorney-General took
up the cudgels for Mr, Trevelyan, and man-
aged so awkwardly as to hit his friend an
ugly rap. Mr. Trevelyan had denied smil-
ing, He had explained that he was attend-
ing to Mr. Healy’s address, and had ar-
gued that it was absurd to believe that
he could have been in a smiling mood.
The Attorney-General, on the other hand,
explained that Mr. Trevelyan had not been
attending to Mr. Healy, but had been en-
gaged in a private conversation with him-
self, and had smiled at matters connected
with that conversation. Thus, the Attorney-
■General proved that when Mr. Trevelyan
■denied he smiled, he had been guilty of
what he charged Mr. Healy with —an ab-
solute falsehood; and that he had again
stated what was not true when he affirmed
that he had been attending to Mr. Healy.
J It was, therefore, made clear that Mr.
Healt’s allusion to the Chief Secretary had
natural and justifiable, and that the
'Chief Secretary's interjection had been im-
proper and incapable of justification. Yet
’the Speaker, unaffected by these demon-
strated facts, adhered to what appears to
Lave been his preconceived purpose; and
•Piter lecturing Mr, Healy, and threatening
him with the application of the cloture,
obstinately refused to rule respecting the
language employed by the Chief Secretary.
# * ♦
The evidence thus afforded of overwhelm-
ing bias affecting a gentleman of refinement
and culture, projects a dismal shadow over
the future prospects of Parliamentary
Government seasoned with cloture. The
new Franchise Bill of Mr. Gladstone is
certain to become law at an eaily period,
no matter what obstructions arc placed
in its way. Its effect will be to con-
fer the right of voting upon additional
bodies of plebeians in country places. Al-
though, until the relation of the rural
labourer to the squirearchy and allied orders
was brought to the effective test of a mea-
sure to confer votes upon the former, it has
been the custom of Conservative writers
and speakers to represent the bond between
these classes as one of affection, the pro-
posal to enact this measure has frightened
the propertied classes and their mouthpieces
into veracity. They now admit that to ex-
tend the franchise to the rural plebeian will
be to strengthen the Radical party in a for-
midable degree. They have dropped the
cant and humbug of pretending that Hodge
is a good Conservative and asks nothing
better than to see existing conditions per-
petuated. Although the shrieking and tremu-
lant confessions now extracted by the terrors
of Toryism are possibly exaggerated, it is
almost sure that they are, in the essential,
correct, Hodge is yet a somewhat dull
fellow, considerably behind his city brother
in comprehension of political principles and
sequences, and still a good deal under the
influence of the squire and the parson. But
there has for many years been carried on
an active propogandism from the cities to
the country, and Radical theories have
found a ready soil in the sensoriums of a
class so hardly dealt with as the agricul-
tural labourers.
• • •
Thus, there seems every justification for
the Conservative conviction that the new
Franchise Bill will open the floodgates of
Radical progress afresh; and if not by itself
adequate to bring about a transfer of the
balance of political power from the oligar-
chy, which has held it in England since the
influence of the Crown was overcome, will
at least so facilitate further advances as to
bring that transfer of influence within
an appreciable distance. The Court J our-
nal, which may be supposed to reflect opi-
nions held in the most Conservative circles,
declares that the masses are socialistic and
republican. If we accept this dictum as true
—and that it is at least true in part, we have
ample evidence in the tone of the news-
papers chiefly patronised by the vulgar—a
time is not very remote when the majority
in the House of Commons will be consti-
tuted, not of a large body of Whigs who are
but Tories wearing a traditional mask, and
of Liberals who are but representatives of
the wealthy bourgoisie, with a slight infu-
sion of so-called Radicals, like Mr. Chamber-
lain, drawing thirty or forty thousand
pounds a year from the labour of factory
hands; but of downright demagogues, men
from the factory, from the Trades Union,
from the public house, from the stump—men
compared with whom Mr. Beadlatoh will
b® a cultured gentleman and an intellectual
prince. Men charged to the throat with the
class resentments, and the indiscriminating
lust for vengeance and reparation, which
burn in the hearts of hitherto distressed and
repressed classes.
* * *
In such case, these men will choose theif
own Speaker. And it is not likely that they
will be content to choose a Peel —a man
educated in moderation and self control.
They will go straight to their ultimate ends
by all means available. And among these
means none will be more obvious than a
relentless partizan as Speaker, wielding un-
mercifully the rules of cloture which have
been—with such fatal lack of foresight—*
made ready to his hand. If Mr. Pebe cannot
restrain his partiality, what is to be expected
of Speaker Bradeatjgh, or Speaker Danton,
or Speaker Couthon, or Speaker Marat?
For men answering to each of these types
will surely appear and thrust their way to
the front in the time which is coming, and
which, terrible as it will be, must come, and
rage and destroy, before true reform suc-
ceeds to purgation, reaction, and exhaus-
tion.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
His Honor'd Will.
The manner in which the Law, which should bd
an object of admiration and confidence to ever;
honest and straightforward man, is converted int
a system universally regarded with a mingling o
reprobation and contempt, was again exemplified
in one of our Courts, the other day. The occasion
was the will case of one Whitworth, deceased
Whitworth wrote his own will; he drew it u]
“ clearly and boldly,” and he carried it toaston
kept by parties named Staff and Nicholson
in order to have his signature attested by
these persons. Only Staff was at home. Whit-
worth signed, and Staff witnessed. Next day
Whitworth returned, and in Staff and Nichol-
son’s presence produced the will, stated to Nichol-
son what it was, acknowledged his signature, anc
got Nicholson to sign as witness. Whitworth
had explained to Staff that he did not wish hia
(Whitworth’s) brother to know of the will. Its
provision disposed of the testator’s property, to
the exclusion of that brother. The testator being
dead, that brother now comes forward to have the
will set aside as irregular, because the two wit-
nesses did not sign at the one time. The Primary
Judge— Manning— gave a decision which occupies
a column of the Herald. A very careful
Judge, is Manning. “Stiff in opinions, al-
ways in the wrong.” The misfortune of this
Judge is that he is constantly at great pains to
furnish reasons why he should have decided ex-
actly opposite to what he does decide. His expo-
sitions are satires upon the judgment which
contradicts them. Thus he explained—accurately
that the question—whether a signature by one
attesting witness upon an acknowledgement
before him, followed by the attestation of another
witness,lat a different time in his and the testator’s
presence, after a re-acknowledgment of the will
by the testator in presence of both, is sufficient ?
—depends upon a very refined explanation of
those words of the Wills Act: “Shall be signed
at the foot or end thereof by the testator
and such signature shall toe acknow-
ledged by the testator in the presence of two
or more witnesses present at the same time*
and such witnesses shall attest and shall subscribe
the will in the presence of the testator.” Judge
Manning remarked that upon the construction of
these words judges and text-writers had differed.
That being so, it was clear that a tolerably wide
discretion rested with himself. He availed him-
self of it to decide against the validity of the will
—that is to say, against the only record of the
deceased’s wishes, except his recorded desire that
his brother should not know of the will. That
brother now takes the property under the only
will that seems valid, the will of the Primary
Judge.
Dynamite.
The other day, certain frothy mouthers in the
Domain spluttered out rancorous eructations about
dynamite, and their readiness to employ that de*

structlve material. They also proclaimed that
dynamite is destined to be the greatest civilising
agency of modern times. There is a degree of
truth in the latter assertion. Dynamite is a civd
ising agent which belongs to the same category as
Kuupp cannon, Gatling guns, and breech-load-
iag rities. That is to say, they may prepare the
world for advances in civilisation, by murder, re-
tail and wholesale. The gospel of dynamite is too
awful for Domain howlers to profane. Dyna-
mite is the weapon of the coward or the deeper,
ate. There is no need to urge Society to pro-
tect itself against the frantic strokes of the
desperate. Real desperation can only exist where
real tyranny presses upon a nation, a class, or upon
individuals. Tyranny, in fact, creates desperation,
which has no existence without it. It may be the
tyranny of a despot, of an oligarchy, or of a vicious
social organisation. And tyranny, as a matter of
course, takes elaborate and (naturally) tyrannical
precautions against crimes of the despairing. But
dynamite is so handy a weapon that the cowardly
and wicked turn to it, as readily as do the desperate.
It is a novel agency, and appropriate provision
against its abuse has not yet been generally agreed
upon. It is possible to conceive a situation in
which one man, or many, might regard their lives
as rendered unendurable by the wilful and ob-
durate iniquity of another man, or class of men,
and might resolve to stake his life against theirs.
Under such circumstances, the bravest, not the
most cowardly, might develop into an assas-
sin. But Society should so regulate matters,
that no coward could resort to dynamite. There
Is no severity of punishment, short of the
torture, which would be excessive against the
employment of dynamite and similar substances
against life. The United States occupy in this
respect a false position. If every step towards an
assassination exposed a man to certain death in
case of detection, the merely malignant and cow-
ardly would stop handling the things. It is not right
that skulking ruffians should be able to prepare in
security materials, and mature plans, for murders
or massacres. The world requires from extremists
a guarantee of good faith, and no guarantee short
of their own lives would be sufficient to fill the
demand. If a man or a class stake their lives
against the lives of another man or class, tho fact
affords evidence that the crisis is equal to the
method adopted to remove it. Every dynamltard
discovered in any country committing or preparing
for destruction of human life should die the death,
whether his project was aimed against inhabitants
of the country where ho was conducting his pre-
parations or against inhabitants of a State at the
other end of the world. The dagger of despair
has, ere now, done humanity real service, but the
poignard of cowardly malic i has no elevating
record.
A Matter of Cours[?]
We do not suppose that anyone is sanguine
enough to expect that aught will come of Mr.
Treasurer Dibbs’ exposure of the patriotism of
Mr. David Buchanan. Not many people will be
even surprised at the character of the revelations
To expect that the Assembly will press the affair
to a practical issue, is to expect too much. That
Mr. Buchanan has a brother is the only news to
us. That, having such a relative, ho should be
comfortably ensconsed in a Civil Service billet is
acceptable as a matter of course. Mr. David
Buchanan is not an exceptional member in this
respect; and it cannot really appear to the ma-
jority of his brother legislators an offence to bo
expiated by real punishment, that he should have
if Mr. Didbs’ version be accepted—made his
support of the Ministerial policy contingent, in
some degree, upon the advancement of his brother.
The episode is a mere fizzle. We have no ex
pectation of its leading the way either to peremp-
tory dealings with Mr. Buchanan, or to the whole-
sale purgation of Parliament and ot the Civil
Service, which is really indicated as requisite by
this partial lifting of the veil. It is significant tha*
Mr. Dibbs himself had not realised the importance
of his disclosures, and had not communicated the
attempt to corrupt him to the Assembly with the
deliberation which the occasion required. He
simply blurted out the accusation' pecause he had
lost his temper and it was the ugliest thing he
could think of. Mr. Buchanan stands no lower in
public estimation than he did before. He couldn’t.
And Mr. Dibbs stands no higher. A\i ebullition
of temper is not to be identified with a scorn of
corrupt overtures, and a calm resolution to expose
and combat such praoMces.
A Sly Satirist.
In its customary article respecting the Queen’s
Birthday, the S.M. Herald drifted into rather
reprehensible satire. Waggery in that journal is
so extraordinary that we suspect the writer didn’t
mean to be caustic. He remarked that the past
year of Her Majesty’s reign “ has been marked by
a disappearance of the disturbing elements
In Ireland to such a degrete that agragrian
outrage is now almost unknown, and Irish
intelligence has little or no interest for colo-
nial readers ” I This is sarcasm number one :
That colonial readers take no interest in any
Irish affairs except outrages. That the condition
of the Irish people is a matter of total indifference
to colonists, except at such times as they have been
harassed and maddened past human endurance,
Into ferocious outrage I Satire the second is
levelled at Her Majesty in person.” The year:
“ has been prominent as one in which the Queen
has given further evidence of her womahly
nature ... by the publication of another vo-
lume.” Who, outside the Herald office required
evidence of the Queen’s nature being womanly ?
What sort of nature did the writer believe the
Queen to have—if not the nature of a woman? The
nature of a frog ? But the sublime height of sar-
casm was attained at the next effort: “ If Satur-
day had been fine and pleasant, large numbers of
people would have spent the day in the open air,
intent on pleasure; their loyalty to the throne
being exhibited in their determination to observe
the day as a holiday.” So, then, the loyalty of the
people of Sydney is measurable by their readiness
to enjoy a holiday, and may be reckoned up by
observation of the degree of determination with
which they frolic on the Queen’s Birthday. But
they do not observe the holiday or frolic much
when the weather is bad. So that the New S<'mth
Wales loyalty is only fine-weather loyalty. This
is the S.M. Herald argument. We wonder if it
was bo intended ? „
A “Star" Apostle.
We noticed in a recent issue of one of the Sydney
dailies that, preparatory to his departure, Mr.
BOdTH, of Gospel Mission notoriety, was pre-
sented with over £300. Now, Mr. Booth
was about three weeks exhibiting in Sydney,
and all the time there was a sort of
grumble circulating that the “ collections ” at
his entertainments did not suliice to pay ex-
penses. No accounts having been published, we
are ignorant how the finances were engineered.
But that is a matter of small concern. The fact
that Mr. Booth received, after three weeks’ ex-
hibition, some £300, contains a pretty significant
moral. £100 per week is equal* to the higher
rates which the most popu'ar and talented
star actors or vocalists receive in the colonies.
Mr. Booth may be quite disinterested, and
moved only by strong and pure enthusiasm.
But there are plenty of drunkards who would
bo ready to reform and to exhibit themselves
as awful-examples-cum-apostles, of intemperance
and of religion, for £ 00 per week. It is just a little
singular that Mr. Booth’s pecuniary expectations
should have been kept so “squat” until the last
moment, while so great a parade was made of his
"mission.” There’s no question but that much
of the significance which attached to Mr. Booth's
visit was due to a widely-disseminated, and sedu-
lously-fostered impression that he was a repentant
sinner, who had, with rare self-sacrifice, devoted
his life to the reformation of fellow-creatures still
wallowing in the vice of which he was once a
distinguished hog. But, devotion and self-
sacrifice at £100 per week, are staggering sorts of
virtues, and there is a reasonable disposition to
view with some suspicion the mission of an
individual who is modestly bashful only about one
matter—the rate at which his pilgrimage pays !
Political Points
One Wesley, of Pennant Hills, means to
offer himself next election for Central Cumber-
land. He must be a very weak stamp of fellow If
he’s not an improvement on either of the present
representatives of that fruity constituency.
“Cupid” Smith’s Bill to repeal the expan-
sive clauses of the Electoral Act, read a second
time last week. The darling of the Macleay is
afraid lest the respectability of the Assembly
should suffer by dilution. Well, it’s weak enough
as it is, goodness knows!
A century’s been staked by brewer Toohey
That Parramatta won’t again choose Youey:
The man of malt contemns the man of meat.
And wager* coin he’s sure to lose his seat;
And yet, unless we’re very much mistaken,
Toohey will lose, and Youey save his bacon.
Rough on Victoria. The London Figaro
says that the best guarantee of Loch’s capacity to
govern Victoria, is that he bossed the Isle of Man
for twenty years—which is as though a fellow
were to say to a friend, “ O, yes, Charles ought to
suit you admirably as butler; he was 20 years boots
at a village pub.”
A writer in the London press, who has
evidently a keen idea of the benehts that the rum-
and-baccy missionary tribe bestow upon the poor
heathen, says ho wishes he could “build up a
Chinese wail round the whole of New Guinea, to
save the eight or nine million Papuan inhabitants
from the inroads of civilization, which meant to
all native races, nothing but gin and disease.” A
moiety of the British press seems to be getting
hold of the right end of the stick at last.
Sir John Robertson doesn’t believe in open
courts. He’s morally certain that half an hour
lu one as Minister would cook him. Like the man
who never washed, and who consequently dreaded,
contact with cold water, he shudders at the bare
idea of having to manipulate the little games of
Lands administration in an above-board fashion
with blooming reporters present. We think there
can be no stronger proof of the necessity of open
land courts than bir John’s objection to them.
Mayor Richardson, of Plattsburg, stated
at a recent public meeting that W. B. Christie, who
lately contested Northumberland, didn’t pay
his last electioneering expenses. The Newcastle
Fletcher reported the statement, and now writs
lor big amounts of damagej are spoken about by
W. B. C. At election times it is hot only much
more effective but far safer to indirectly suggest
rather than directly state that the opposite side
has been guilty of breaches of the decalogue.
Clifford Lloyd, Secretary for the Interior,
in Egypt, granted two months leave of absence on
account of ill-health—otherwise, Clifford Lloyd is
decently shunted, because his overbearing temper
u ,s become intolerable to the other officials, native
and English. Nubar Pasha wouldn’t stand him.
It is evidently better to be an Egyptian than an
Irishman. Clifford Lloyd was never granted two
month's leave of absence while he was rough-
riding an Irish district as a Resident Magistrate.
Sutter says that he knows of a “Lands”
case in which Minister Farnell reversed a decision
three times, and the fourth time both parties ap-
pealed to him, and heF ultimately decided that as
the land was in dispute, it belonged to neither
party, and declared it to be the property of the
Crown. Parnell says the statement is a blooming
story; so Suttor means to move for the papers in
the case. We shouldn't be in the least surprised if
Farnell discovered he’d been deciding with varia-
tions after lunch.
“ Why,” smirks Slattery, the attorney,
“should the decision of any Board be final and
conclusive? Why should e’er a horny-handed
selector be deprived of his glorious privilege of
appeal to the Privy Council? Why, oh, why, should
the pundits of ‘the perfection of reason’ be shorn
of their privileges and debarred from their ‘ perks ’
by ever so little an instalment of legislative
common sense ?” And even as he speaks, Bur-
ro wa’s simperthetic representative drops a tear at
the bare tnought of the unspeakable desolation of
uu attorneyless community.
Says that bounceable Jingo, the rampant
Service, in a despatch to Murray-Smith, “Should
our representations be disregarded, the Govern-
ment of Victoria will instantly proceed to enact
legislation of a severe and effectual character. If
I instruct you, as I now do, to make this known to
Her Majesty’s Government, it is not in any wise as
a threat, but simply—” &c.&c. But why not drop
bluster, dear Jamie, and enact the effectual legis-
lation? That, surely, would be not merely the
more sensible plan, but the course most directly
calculated to fetch Jules Ferry. Brag, you know,
wasn t such a good dog as Holdfast.
'the administration of the land laws has
Hot always been facilitated in the past by the class
of subordinate officials appointed. In one district
alone four Land Agents were successively ap-
pointed, No. 1 introduced to the local upper ten
a lady as his wife, who was only on brevet rank.
No. 2 was sent up for three years for embezzle-
ment. No. 3 was killed by a fall from his horse
between the date of his appointment and the time
for entering upon his duties. He is probably
honest, as he is dead. No. 4 was lately arrested,
charged with the same offence as No. 2.
The star of &r George Grey is once more in
the ascendant in New Zealand. When Major
Atkinson, the Premier of the Colony, lately
stumped the country, the electors of Christchurch
and Dunedin treated him with almost ferocious
hostility, and all but refused to give him a hearing.
When Sir George Grey, however, appeared among
them, he was welcomed with acclamation, and re-
ceived unanimous votes of confidence as the true
leader of the Liberal section of the people of the
colony. As an orator, the G.O.M. of New Zealand
is without a rival on this side the equator, and
even In hngland very few public speakers enjoy
the same power of evoking the applause and en-
thusiasm of the multitude.
The worst of Dailey is that he will spread
the butter too thick. He is for ever endeavouring
to add fresh perfume to the violet. When, for
example, he felt it needful to justify the Nominee
Chamber against certain censures passed upon it
in another place, the cocky little chap couldn’t
confine himself to justlflcat on; no, he must needs
assert that the Upper House enjoys at the present
moment as large a share of the confidence and
admiration of every intelligent citizen in the
country as anv legislative body ever possessed,
and that the Busbys and Billy Byrnes and Sugar
Knoxes and Brodribbs constitute the decus ct
tutamen of the State. About such a gush of
esprit there is a leetle too much Bede.
“Mr. M'Quade said he would like to have
the holiday for Windsor,” and so Mr. Stuart had it
proclaimed for Windsor. This holiday proclaim-
ing is a farce, as at present worked. What has the
member of a district got to do with the question
of proclaiming a holiday for that district ? His
representative duties do not extend properly to
such matters, unless he be specially delegated pro
re nata to request the proclamation of a local
holiday. The Premier seems to think that a holi-
day must be proclaimed for any district, if only
the local M.P. strolls into his office and says:
“ Stuart, old man. I want a holiday for Berribo-
bubbalong.” T. R. Smith has a private “ spec.”
on up the Nepean way, and so he demands a pro-
claimed .holiday for the Nepean district, and the
meek Alec blandly complies as a matter of course.
This insane practice must be stopped.
Strange to say, two Parnellite members,
Messrs, bullivan and Lynch, were staying in the
Victorian Hotel, over the cloak-room of the station
where the London police say they discovered the
dynamite and clock-work arrangements, and had
there not been a hitch in the working of the
machinery, new elections for Westmeath and
Ennis would probably have become necessary.
To the ordinary understanding, this circumstance
would seem to point to the fact that, so lar as
complicity with the dynamiters is concerned, the
Parnell party is as innocent as unborn twins. We
should not be at all surpri ed however, to find the
wide-awake old woman in Hunter Street gravely
asserting that it was a put up job, and that the
Home Rulers took lodgings at tne Victoria Hotel,
for the purpose of making a case for themselves
if the secret was blabbed and the thing turned out
a failure. Charity covereth a multitude of sins,
but just at the present date a 30s. overcoat is a
heap better.
The Giraffe (with whom it is invariably
neck or nothing) frequently puts a case with
extreme cogen.y. Here is an instance, in con-
nection with the Dalley-O’Connor recriminations.
He pointed out to the Assembly that what had
been said in the Assembly was said by an ir-
responsible unit, by a gentleman who occupied no
seat in the Ministry, and was not responsible to
the House for his individual expression of opin-
ion. But in the Upper Chamber the remarks
which had been made had been made by the
Attorney-General in the present Government, by
the representative of the Government, and by the
mouthpiece of the Government ; in other words,
every word said by Mr. Dailey must be considered
as having been said by the Government, and
his insinuations against the Speaker’s imparti-
ality and judgment were attacks which must
recoil upon the Ministry themselves, because they
were made by a Minister in the Upper House.
That defines the exact difference witn perfect
accuracy.
“ A great deal has been said,” remarked
Minister Parnell the other evening in the Legis-
lative Assembly, “about Ministers being corrupt,
but I maintain that never had a Minister in any of
tho public departments of this colony shown him-
self to be corrupt.” Inasmuch as agreement on
points of terminology is essential to the right
conduct of an argument, we can’t debate thi«
question of Ministerial incorruption with optimist
Parnell, since between thefmeaning that we attach
to the term “ corrupt ’ and that which he attaches
to if, is a difference deep and wide. We are not
pessimists, yet firmly believe and (were it not for
a libel law specially contrived to cover iniquity)
could readily prove that several New South Wales
Ministers have most patently shown themselves
corrupt in the discharge of their public duties—
that is, if tho term “ corrupt” may be held to apply
to a Minister’s filling the Civil service with his
relations, to a Minister’s having an interest in
Government contracts, or to a Minister’s having
an interest in Government-paid “ compensations,”'

The conduct of the “Lords ” in permitting

ample the other day, to representative assemblies.
It adjourned “ in consequence of one of the aider-
men being incapacitated from understanding the
business.” If other councils were to follow suit
no business of any kind would ever bedoue. What
the sober Maryborough should have done, would
have been to make the Incapacitated one adjourn
to the pump or the lock-up.

to the fact that the rule of Gonzales has been oae
of fiscal oppression, personal corruption (he has
bagged a million sterling since his election to the

trigue with Yankee railway Jobbers. A revolution
hourly expected. As a regular army hardly any

Derby isn’t big enough fool to commit himself in
that way.

Graham Barry, the turn-coat from liberal-
ism has withdrawn the permission he officially
granted for the holding of Secularist Conventicles
in the Melbourne Hall of Science. His alleged
reason is because money for admission was taken
in a plate at th * door. This doesn’t seem a good
reason. In our childhood, we regularly attended a
Free Kirk of Scotland where money was always
taken in a plate at the doors. It wasn't called a
charge for admission, certainly, but that’s what it
came to all the same, ’i here was no compulsion,
only you must. A picket of grim and watchful
elders mounted guard over the plate, and observed
exactly what you put in it. We never heard of
anyone courageous enough to pass it without de-
positing a bawbee at the least. Hut. any way, the
idea that any body of citizens have to obtain per-
mission from the civil power to meet and discuss
their religious views or to bold what they regard
as a service, is a monstrous blotch on tree institu-
tions.
Dr. Barry, Bishop of Sydney, in his recent
address, remarked that there was too irreat a dispo-
sition on the part of people to regard the colonies
as places wherein to make money, and to be
quilted as soon as that end was accomplished. He
deprecated this The Bishop’s remarks were
levelled at laymen. He missed a chance of show-
ing he was in earnest. He could have pointed the
moral by direct application to Colonial Bishops—a
cla‘s of men who are notorious for scuttling back
to England every chance, and when they are
pretty full of the colonies, staying “at Home’’ al-
together. Had the Bishop denounced this custom
right out, and made a downright declaration re-
specting his own intentions in that regard, it would
have better become him, than meaningless maun-
derings about commercial adventurers and busi-
ness men, who are really under no strong moral
obligation to fix their domicile where they make
their money. But Dr. Barry seems, at least, con-
sistent This sort of talk is quite in keeping with
his presence on Booth’s platform, the other day, to
express bis sympathy with the movement and set
an example of not totilly abstaining.
Granny’s Noumea correspondent tells us
that Sisters of Mercy say Mass in the prisons of
New Caledonia! If the fellow’s other information
be only as accurate as the above item (as indeed
we are inclined to believe it is) he must be, a most
unique meteor in the ranks of journalism.
Granny’s special cable announces that
Canon W. Boyd Carpenter has been appointed
Bishop of Blpou. Well, who cares? Australian
readers would have waited the ordinary course of
post for that item of information, without a mur-
mur. If Canoa Carpenter (never before heard of)
or Canon anybody has refused a fat bishopric, the
fact would have been odd enough to render it
worth cabling. These fellows who accept bishoprics
always remind us of Julia, In Byron’s “ Don Juan.”

take the fat billet,” and in the same instant they
take it. She “ whispering ‘ I’ll ne'er consent,’ con-

“There was a time, 1 confess,” says the
Congregational Jefferis, “ when in my zeal for
religious liberty 1 advocated the exclusion of
religious teaching from the curriculum of the
State, and 1 was prepared as a Christian man to
take all the consequences; but I think I have grown
a little wiser as I have grown older.” What has
really happened in the course of the Jefferis de-
velopment is this: he has discovered that the ex-
clusion of religious leaching from the curriculum
of the Stste means the relegation, at no distant
period, of the parson, with his honey-tnunder of
truism and dogma, to a oack seat. When Jefferis
advocated it, he merely meant an indirect dig at
Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism. He now
finds that the secular mind lumps priest, parson,
pastor, and minister, into one mendicant mass, and
that, if his office is to be conserved, it must be by
co-operating with blackrobedom to force the
State to devote so many hours a week of the al-
lotted school time to training the young genera-
tion to be believers in the Unknowable, and the
hierarchy that plays tricks in Its name.
The good little boy, who couldn’t tell a
lie, came home late from school, the other day,
with his ears full of mud and a face that looked
like a bad copy of the b ittle of Waterloo. Mamma
fainted right away, of course, and then Pa de-
manded to know what broke all the chips off his
son and heir. “ I was running along, and fell down
on a heap of blue metal, sir,” replied the youthful
Reuter. “ And which of you got the worst of it ?”
shouted a younger brother, who was evidently
“more than 7.” “Why, Ginger Johnson did,”
roared Keuter; “I blacked both bis eyes, and
burst hi • nose, and slit all his shirt t* rags ” And
then, suddenly noticing that he had given himself
away, the good little hoy unbuttoned, leaned over
his Pa’s knees, and wept bitterly.
The gorgeous scribes who write on new
fashions in bonnets and bustles have pretty nearly
•“xhuusted the English language, as far as its
capacity for description goes. There is nothing
left for anybody else. This is the ineffable style in
which they write now. We quote from a fashion
paper:—” The cardinal or orange is repeated in the
waistcoat, and hinted at in tho cuffs and collar.
That seen in the skirt is. of course, introduced
episodically, though it suggests continuity. There
lies the art of it—an art that only experience can
fully teach.” We should think so. Thunder! We
may next expect to find them writing in the grand
Gibbonian manner on the chaste splendour of
elastic suspenders, and the secret chronological
suggestiveness of clocked stockings. We shall
quit the flowing fields of literature if this kind of
thing goes on. When we have invented a honeyed
phrase for our own special use and delight, we don’t
care to see it used the next week by some creature
of frills and furbelows to describe a new colour in
petticoats. Hardly.
“ If it were in my power, all I could wish
in regard to the matter would be to attain the
position so magnificently pourtrayed in the lan-
guage of Sterne, that the recording angel might
drop a tear and wipe it out for ever.” Thus the
O'Connor, in a demnltion mixed sort of way—for
who, from those words of his, can arrive at any
definite conclusion as to what it was he desired,
unltrss it were himself to be wiped out—a consum-
mation most devoutly to be wished by a too-much-
yabbered-at community ; yet hardly by a Dan
whose faith in himself is superb. But why wipe?
We ar« prepared to pardon Dan his attack upon
Dailey and his forbears ; it was in a measure pro-
voked, but not his injury to Sterne’s famous pas-
sage. Sterne never was idiotic enough to write
that the recording angel dropped a tear and wiped
it out for ever. “ Blotted ” was the word that
Uncle Toby’s chronicler employed, not “ wiped.”
There is nothing more revolting than the misquo-

Sir John Rooertson warned the Minister
for Lands that by providing for the admission of
lawyers to plead in the Land Court, on appeals,
risk was being incurred that the Land Bill would
be rendered unworkable. No heed was paid to Sir
John's representation, and the Ministerial proposal
was carried on division by 28 to 27 votes, the ma-
jority including all the lawyers present. There
are 27 lawyers in the Legislative Assembly, so that
in a thin House it is a foregone conclusion that if
they have rolled up to attend to their professional
interests they can generally command a majority.
We believe Sir John’s prediction will be verified.
A selector of the class which land laws are intended
to serve will have no chance against his ordinary
adversary, a pastoral lessee, either wealthy himself
or representing some wealthy financial backer or
institution. If it comes to feeing counsel in dis-
puted cases, it will not pay to select. Grounds for
getting up a dispute are easily formed, if desired,
and the man who selects a choice bit of land, which
a squatter regards as too valuable to himself to
relinquish without a struggle, will be in a tight
place. The selector’s calculations will be that the
deposit on so many acres will absorb so much of
his means ; it will take so much to effect necessary
improvements ; so much to maintain him till hia
stock of produce brings in returns. But add to
that the expense of feeing a solicitor and a bar-
rister, in order not to be at a hopeless disadvantage
when his dispute with the squatter is finally ad in-
dicated, and the margin of profit disappears. The
arrangement is ridiculous and unnecessary. If It
be carried out. Ministers for Lands will probably
discover that their whole time all the year round
will be absorbed in presiding over the Court of
Appeal, while professional advocates split straws
and spin out harangues, according to their invaria-
ble custom. In Queensland, when the land was
first opened in a comprehensive fashion to selec-
tion under the Alienation Act of 1868, the Land
Commissioner in each district heard and decided
disputes in open court, sitting alone. His decisions
were forwardedltojthe Minister, for confirmation
or otherwise. The plan was simple, economical
and speedy, and worked with admirable efliciency
There should be no reason why it should not work
as well here. Surely, neither Commissioners nor
Ministers in New South Wales are necessarily
more accessible to improper influences than the
same officials are in Queensland.

for one month for each wound, which would make
23 months in irons out of the 18 years he sent him
up for. Such a Mosaic sort of sentence, breathing
as it does vindictiveness rather than justice, is as
gross an offence against what should be the spirit
of the law as was the crime of the wretch upon

Musha now, luk at dis! His Holiness Pope
Leo XIII. has just been graciously pleased to

Indeed, and has been bestowed on Cavalier Dalton
for valuable services rendered to the Catholic

ticularly for the scientific manner in which he
transformed “ tay an’ ehoogcr” into “ goold and
silvur,” and kept the Pope s pot a-boiling. We
don’t know what pay a Commendatore gets, but
we believe his principal duties are to get his hair
cut once a year, to abstain from eating fried
bread, and to send all his surplus cash to buy
spring costumes for the marble saints and saint-
esses who board and lodge in St. Peter’s Church at

Bluff in the South to Cape Whatsitsname in the
North, working, as one of them said of himself,
“ day and night ” for him, are nipped in the bud at
one fell swoop. To say we are shocked to hear of

What a touching thing modesty is—literary
modesty, especially! Mr. Alexander Sutherland,

can long maintain the practice. Nor do I consider
It an objectionable sign in a man when I hear that
as often as he has essayed to keep an unbroken
diary so often has he failed! I have done so my-
self repeatedly ; commenced them without num-
ber and suffered them to collapse. My deliberate
conclusion is that diaries are the work of inferior
minds,” His deliberate conclusion, remember. It
ii very evident that Mr. Alexander Sutherland has
intentions on Westminster Abbey. He was over

about our prospects. We should not care the

The Hou. William Rolleston, Minister of
Lands for tbe colony of New Zealand, was not
born to be drowned in cold water—that’s pretty
evident, anyhow. As he was crossing the Waiau
River, lately, in a stage coach, the front seat came
out with a jerk, and William was pitched over-
board and fell between the wheels and the horses’
feet. In this position he was rolled over and under
several consecutive times in as many seconds, and
those who saw him at that time declare they
wouldn’t have risked a po stage-stamp on his
chance of drawing any more salary from the
colonial revenue. But this is where these persons
showed their want of grasp of the fact that a
Crown Minister has never yet been known to take
kindly to cold water—or give way to it in any
shape or form—and the Hon. William was no ex-
ception to the rule. Before his friends had time
to shake in their boots or attempt to steady their
nerv.es from their respective liasks, the plucky
Minister was out of the -water and calling to his
secretary to mind and till up a voucher for a new
suit of clothes to replace h’s damaged and dripping

“The handsome and gifted young Queen of
Bulgaria has published a volume from her own
pen of so much genuine merit as to call for the
most laudatory mention. It is a romance of Bul-
garian life, and opens up to the Western people a
new view of the people of the youngest kingdom
of the East. The authoress has eclipsed our own
Queen, whose Royal twaddle about trivial Bal-
moral events and about John Brown has not im-
proved the public appreciation of the mental
power of the House of Hanover.” The above is
from a London weekly. We don’t doubt but that
it may be true. We haven’t read Carmen Silva’s
book—“Carmen Silva” is the Bulgarian Queen’s
nom de plume— but we aie quite prepared to admit
that a Qui on or other Royal personage may write
a clever book. The difficulty is to know when one
has done so, without coming back as a ghost to as-
certain the truth after a generation or so. It has
become so much the habit of present-day writers
to slobber admiration over any book which Royalty
produces, that unless one reads the book for ones-
self, a safe opinion as to its merits is impossible.
People who wish to know the true merits of Queen
Victoria's books, require to read French and
American criticisms as well as the London Toady
and the Sydney Morning Lickspittle.
Charles Ogden Ferris lately died in Brook-
lyn. He was, in his day, a rival claimant to the
Tichborne estates; and, though a thriftless ne’er-
do-well, worked up a plausible plot that would
have done credit to the smartest swindler on the
boards. He read up our own Roger’s case to the
very hilt, and then concocted a story so cleverly
combining truth with falsehood, that one of th.-
soundest Yankee lawyers of the day, General
Barnes, for a time swore by him. Ferris rehearsed
his first Interview with Barnes for weeks before-
hand, and the pathetic style in which he described
his adoption of the name of Ferris from a dear
companion, who, in his travels, he averred, died
alone in his arms, would have taken the cake from
a tip-top actor. Even hard-headed old Barnes
began to glisten about the gig-lamps over it, and
for a time Ferris had a good show of knocking out
our Roger. But Ferris had, of course, a pal in the
“ swingle,” one Jules Berrant, a frenchman.
Berrant was too smart, and tried to prove every-
thing so spic and span, that the detectives soon
pricked up their suspicious ears, and the result
was that Ferris was bowled out, and the rosy game
burst up. And now, just as Roger is about to
burst on the arena of liberty, Charles Ogden, his
quondam rival, has waltzed into the hereafter.
Scientists who have tried the experiment
say that if you dance on a worm long enough it is
apt to turn. Something similar may be said of
Scotchmen. If you keep pestering them long
enough (say for about fourteen or fifteen centu-
ries), you will probably incite them to turn also,
and let off an epigrammatic remark that contains
a heap of wit and wisdom. For example, last
Wednesday night, the irrepressible Dawvid was
worrying the Government, and airing his legal
knowledge, when Muster Stooat bobbed up and
informed the Mudgee junior that the most that
could bo said in his (Dawvid’s) favour was that he
“possessed a very large fund of learned ignor-
ance.” And for fear this wasn’t gruel enough,
another hon. member, who is sometimes face-
tiously termed “ Honest John,” struck the floor,
and declared that, in his opinion, Dawvid “ had, in
his professional career, turned more scoundrels
loose cn the country than all the other lawyers
put together.” This reminds us that Dawvid once
defended a man from Mundooran, who was up for
hoisc-steaiing, with such wonderful eloquence and
powerful reasoning that the prisoner was honour-
ably acquitted, and told he left the court without
the slightest stain upon bis character. And this so
pleased the man from Mundooran that he at once
offered to make his astute defender a present of
the very moke he was charged with stealing.
“ Give me a place to stand, and IT1 move
the world,” was the proud boast of Archimedes, as
he grabbed hold of a clothes prop and went slosh-
ing around the streets of Syracuse. And that’s
exactly the way John Allan O’Neill (who diffuses
intelligence amongst the native bears and “go-
hannas”down South througa the medium of the
Queanheyan Times) felt on Monday last as he
went whooping through the town, generously offer-
ing to kick this old globe of ours as high as the
Milky Way, or the price of house rent. Unfor-
tunately for John Allan, however, the servile
minions of a sanguinary and tyrannical Govern-
ment objected to his boisterous hilarity, and just
by way of cooling his animal spirits, they got him
by the scruff of the neck and the back bosom of
his pants and slung him into a dungeon cell. Next
morning he was brought before a bloodthirsty
despot, who sent him up for four days without the
option of a fine, for his previous “righteous ” con-
duct. This somewhat surprised John Allan at
first, but remembering that Edmund Yates, an-
other somewhat distinguished journalist, was then
putting in a stretch of four months, John Allan
recovered his composure, and calling out, “All
hell shall stir for this,” he hooked himsell on to
the sergeant’s arm and strode off to inspect his
new lodgings. We wouldn’t miss the Qceanbeyan
Terror’s next leader for the wealth of all the

The ladies of St. George’s Church, East St.
Kilda, are very thoughtful, and know how to ap-
preciate a duck of a man when he comes that way.
It is long ago since in these pages we made profes-
sion of faith in the Rev. Rentoul’s ability by word,
and especially by gesture, to win the respect, con-
fidence, and admiration of ladies to whom he ad-
dressed himself. Some who had delighted to dub
him “ the fighting parson ” made it appear that his
departure from St. Kilda for the Professorial chair
was unwept, unbonoured, and unsung; and, in
truth, for a time, it looked ominously like it. But
the triumph of faith has been secured. Last week
the ladies assembled, and, seeking out the fiery
preacher, presented him with a casket containing
a purse of sovereigns. The intrinsic value of the
gift was not to be despised, but that which reached
away down to the bottom drawer of the profes-
sorial bosom was the affection evidenced by the
red quivering lips and the admiration betokened
by the blue, liquid eyes. Whoever else may fall
away, the ladies will be still true to their own old
Larry. And the Reverend Laurence responded
feelingly. He promised that the sovereigns the
casket contained would be “ thrown into enduring
shapes of use and beauty.” Wasn’t that neatly
put ? Instead of saying he would buy ham and
sandwiches and tripe and beef and buns and
things with the money, as a less poetic man might
say.-he allowed the ladies to infer all that; and,
Instead of saying that he and his family will enjoy
the spread, he In an off-handed felicitous way,
quite peculiar to himseif, announces that the
articles will be thrown into enduring shapes of
use and beauty! That, of course, is into him and
the little ones I Touching simplicity!
Honest old John Mackay, the harbour-
master at Cooktown, is the man after whom the
sugaropolis of Queensland is named. John kept a
diary of his early days, and here’s an interesting
leaf from it:—“Seif and party came overland to

2nd March, 1860, and pushed north. Experienced
varied adventures by flood and field, until we
reached the head waters of the Burdekin, lat. 17'

marked by Dalrymple, but as stores were ex-
hausted and fever and ague sotting in, agreed to
return. Crossing the Burdekin going south, we
diverged to the eastward of the outward track,
when the head waters of the Pioneer River were
discovered and traced to where the town of Mackay
now stands. Leaving the Pioneer and crossing
the coast range, we buried one of our poor com-
rades at the head of the eastern branch of the Isaac
River, now known as Denison Creek. A week
after, we arrived at the camp of Mr. D. Connor
(now of Mackay), who was then forming Collaroy
Station. Crossing the Broadsound Range, we
arrived at Marlborough, and then went on to
Rockhampton, from which place we were absent
over five months. In 1863, I formed Greenmount
Station, and chartering a schooner at Rockhamp-
ton, ascended the river some four miles above
where the town of Mackay now stands, when, after
sending a sketch of the river and true position to
the Crown Lands office, Brisbane, it was shortly
afterwards declared a port of entry.” Many a
fortune has been won and lost since then, while
the man who opened up the land is rewarded by
the paltry pittance of a harbour master’s salary.
We, therefore, see how much better It la to be
a first-class cricketer than a hardy backwood
pioneer.
This is another about Patti. You will con-
sider it an anecdote of the days of Queen Anne to
hear that there is a rumour to tne effect that
Adelina is going back to her husband, the Marquis
de Caux. If we had not been offered lately—in
recognition of our literary abilities—the admiral-
ship of one of the Watson’s Bay whooping-cough-
ers, we should for one weak but rapturous moment
wish that we were in the shoes of the Marquis de
Caux. One of our disinterested reasons would be
that the Patti diamonds are alone worth £40,000.
Talking of these baubles (we are, of course, now
writing for our appreciative burglar readers), it is
said that the triple necklace of diamonds which
Patti wears occasionally, contains 122 stones of an
average value of £130 each. Some people have the
luck of it. All the jewellery we have ever had
was a dog-collar, which a country Mayor presented
to us on vacating his office. The string of tur-
quoise which the diva wears in “ Traviata ” is
unique, and cannot be matched. To take care
of these precious jewels, she has four “ diamond
men,” two of whom are detectives, and two are
watchmen. On the night when she has to sing,
these men get from the great safe in the hotel the
satchel containing the jewels, and take it in a car-
riage down to the academy. They wait about the
door of Patti’s dressing-room until the maid asks
for the bag, when it is handed in, and a moment
after Patti comes out wrapped in a long cloak,
which she wears until she makes her entrance.
The “ diamond men ” keep their eyes upon her.
When the cue is given, the cloak is thrown to the
maid, and Patti goes on glistening with gems. The
four men and two maids watch her through the
act. The instant she is out of sight of tbe audi-
ence, the cloak is again thrown over her, and five
minutes after she enters her dressing-room the
mysterious bag is handed out again, and the four
men depart with it as silently as they came. There
would be a difficulty of selling these jewels, we
presume. That is, they would be recognised.
Otherwise we would rather pay to see these four
men than to hear Patti. We are cynics, you know.
The Rev. A. C. Gillies is a Presbyterian
minister at Dunedin (N.Z.) During the past few
years, ever since his arrival in the colony in fact !
he has managed to keep the Presbytery of Dun-
edin in hot water up to its very eyebrows. There
has been no need for any member of that body
visiting the Sulphur Springs since Gillies came
among them. That intensely orthodox divine has
enough of that article on hand to start half-a
dozen little places of his own at any time. Lately
some unfortunate Dunedin reporters have come
in for a severe scalding from the spout of his
ecclesiastical kettle. To one who had incurred his
wrath by reporting his speeches too faithfully, he
•ent a letter forbidding his attendance in future at
any of the church meetings or soirees. These
blessed privileges, he explained, were intended for
people who had souls worth saving, and were cap-
able of receiving salvation, and not for low-minded
reporters, who hadn’t, and weren’t. To another
he sent a note inviting him to attend and report a
funeral sermon he intended to preach in connec-
tion with the death of a member of his flock. The
reporter did not turn up, but soon received a note
from the irate Devil Puncher, in which he declared
that now he knew the scribe to be a fellow of
low moral tastes, who fills his “dirty paper
with notices of vile prostitutes, jockeys, gamblers,
idle cricketers, lazy loons of scullers, but who has
no appreciation for such a man as John Reid ” (the
departed). He followed up the tirade from which
we have quoted by the threat that henceforth the
“dirty paper should get no more of our advertise-
ments.” This awful resolution, it is thought, will
result in shutting up the newspaper establishment,
and turning all its little devils and reporters loose
and penniless on society. Touching the reverend
expounder's estimate of the reportorial soul, how-
ever, we may say we never yet knew a reporter
who would not cheerfully be able to report the
conflagration down below. Heavens! if some of
the boys who have gone before could only get
back, what terrific big type we would require to
do justice to their descriptions of the “ devouring
element ” and the agonies they endured for wait
of something decent to drink!
Mr. Bierce, of the San Francisco Wasp, is
one of the neatest and most cynicaliy straight-
forward writers in the American press. His com-
ments in the recent Patti craze, in ’Frisco, are
terribly true. Thus:—“This Patti craze has a
more serious aspect. Second only to this woman’s
fame as a singer is her fame as an adulteress.
Heaven forbid that I should set myself up as a
censor of any adulteresses save those who have
the hardihood to continue famous; I only beg to
point out that when Christ shielded‘the woman
taken in adultery ’ He did not tell her that if she
was a good singer she might go her way and sin no
more. That is how 1 answer the ever-ready sneer
about ‘casting the first stone.’ That is how I
cast it. If the Magdalen, finding herself possessed
of a single talent, had gone into business as a show
without reforming her private morals, Christ
would not have been found standing all night in
line to buy tickets for himselt and the Blessed
Virgin.” In the same vein he trounces another
celebrated woman, and lashes the generation—
“mothers, wives, sisters, daughters and sweet-
hearts—base enough to gaze without a blush at
the posings of a prostitute recommended by a
Prince.” And he justifies his strictures as follows:
—“These be plain words, my masters; but shall I
eat the bread of sycophancy by flattering vice ?
Shall I in sober earnest imitate the ponderous jest
of Erasmus, setting my pen to the praise of fools ?
Not for a kingly crown—may the devil hot-pitch
me when 1 do. Sin in your own way while I sin in
mine, but when I justity either your vices or my
own may my pen fall from a lifeless hand. Serve
ye what ye will, I am for the truth. I am for pre-
serving the ancient, primitive distinction between
right and wrong. Follow the Prince of Wales who
will — the virtues of Socrates, the wisdom of
Aristotle, the example of Marcus Aurelius and
Jesus Christ are good enough tor me. They en-
gage my admiration and rebuke my life. From
my fog-scourged and plague-smitten morass I lift
reverent eyes to the shining summits of eternal
truth, where they stand ; 1 strain my senses to
catch the words of the law that they deliver—go
ye to the Grand Opera House and weep at the
squalling of a singed cat.” Bravo, brave Bierce I
While, in England, as in Australia, the
daily papers published respecting the death of the
Duke of Albany only what accorded with a pre-
conceived opinion as to how a royal saint should
start tor heaven, and the swell weeklies followed
suit, there were papers of a more independent and
veracious disposition, which scorned to treat their
readers as fools or children. Modern Society, a
London weekly, circulating mainly among the
mlddle-as distinguished from the fashionable-
classes, gives the lacts only distantly hinted at by
its contemporaries, in a straightforward way, thus:
—“ From what I hear from Cannes it is impossible
to doubt that the Duke of Albany’s end was
hastened by the appetite which was suddenly
aroused in him there for amusing excitement. He
got into a very fast set, and went along with them
in the race after pleasure. There was not the
restraining presence of wife and child. A taste
sprang up for the emotions of the gambling-table*
at Monaco. I hear indirectly from a banker in a
position to be well informed that he had had heavy
losses there, and that he constantly lamented his
bad luck. The day before he died, he spent four
hours at the tables. The atmosphere was stifling,
and the crowd dense and excited. He was pressed
upon and pushed about, for equality is the law of
the public gaming-house. The night before, he
had been to the Bachelors’ Ball, and danced until
after daybreak, and he left Monaco to go to a
dancing party. Dissipation of this kind was so
new to him that it almost Intoxicated him. The
reaction set in on the evening of the night on
which he had the fatal attack. Nearly everyone
thought it polite to tell him that he looked well. It
was disagreeable to him to oe reminded of his con-
stitutional weakness. So far from looking in ex-
cellent health, he had a yellow colour in the face,
a drawn expression, and pinched nostrils. I am
not an invalid, and am not easily carried away by
excitement; yet when I go to the South of Franco
I am so exhilarated that I feel like one who has
been inhaling laughing gas. How much more
violently must the stimulating air and the brilliant
colours of the sea, sky, and mountains have
affected one who bad been an invalid from his
Ley. Mr. Stiggins : “ Mary, you should not waste your
precious time curling your hair; had Providence intended it
to be curled, He would have curled it for you.”
Young Lady : “ Indeed ! When I was an infant He curled
it for me; but now I am grown up, He thinks I am able to do
it myself.”

cradle? When I speak of the Duke as having
plunged into social dissipation, I have no intention
to blame him. It was natural, under the circum-
stances, for him to have overstepped the bounds
of prudence."
The Brisbane libel case, in which the jury
were discharged in consequence of being unable
to agree whether “Bobby Byrne” of Queens-
land Figaro should have to pay Michael Ready,
J P., of Mackay. £2000 for libel, was based upon an
article in which Figaro denounced Sam Griffith’s
appointment of Ready to the Bench as an outrage
on the institutions of Justice. Figaro gave a list
of Police Court cases in which Ready had been de-
fendant, as follows, prefacing the list with the re-
mark that Ready was a man of means and in a
position to successfully “square” or “husnup”
all the cases in which the phrase “ no appearance
of either party,” stands:— 4 * Here's the record:—In
1875—Michael Ready, charged with insulting and
abusive language, also assault and battery; fined
£2 or seven day’s imprisonment. Fine paid. July
5,1875—Michael Ready, charged with abusive and
insulting language; Fined, with charges, £513s. In
1878—Michael Ready, charged with assault and
battery ; no appearance of either party. Same
year—Michael Ready, charged with the illegal de-
tention of a horse; ordered to restore the animal
within twelve hours. Same year—Michael Ready,
charged with assault and battery; no appearance
of either party. In 1879— Michael Ready, charged
with obstructing a Custom-house officer in the dis-
charge of his duty; no appearance of either party,
Same year—Michael Ready, charged with assault-
ing Constable O’Connor in River-street, Mackay;
dismissed. In 1880—Michael Ready, charged with
assault and battery ; no appearance of either
party. Same year—Michael Ready, charged with
prize fighting; bound over to keep the peace, him-
self in £30, and two sureties of £25 each. In 1881—
Michael Ready, charged with keeping a disorderly
public house ; dismissed. Same year—Michael
Ready, charged with assault and battery ; no ap-
pearance of either party. In 1882—Michael Ready,
charged with indecent language and indecent
assault : no appearance of either party. In
1883 — Michael Ready, charged with assault
and battery; no appearance of either party.”
Beady, in his evidence, gave an explanation to the
effect that it was all a mistake in every instance.
In other words, that he had suffered the singular
misfortune of having been, on thirteen distinct
occasions, brought before the Bench on ground-
less charges. Also that the Mackay Police Magis-
trate and Sergeant of Police had a down on him.
It was elicited, however, that in at least one case,
two other magistrates adjudicated. Mr. Ready
was put through his facings in spelling, just as was
our own dear Jannery John, J.P., C.M.G.,and with
a similar result. They didn’t try him with Janu-
ary, probably conjecturing that all magistrates
have now made a point of mastering that cele-
brated word. But they gave him 44 believe ” to
worry, and he rendered it “belive,” while 44 hono-
rarium” he altogether declined to tackle. The
evidence elicited goes to show that Figaro did
good public service by its vigorous and plucky
comments, [and that Sam Griffith will leave behind
him, as Premier of Queensland, a dirty record as
the man who humiliated the Parliament of the
colony by nominating a recidlviste to the Speaker-
ship, and who disgraced the Magistracy by hoist-
ing a man from the dock to the bench.
In the words of the Oriental poet, 44 May
jackasses sing o’er our grandmother’s grave ”
when we forget to champion the cause of young
and lovely woman. But we need hardly empha-
size the fact that the lady to whom this par. is re-
spectfully though humbly dedicated, is just about
one of the loveliest of her sex. But she is in dire
distress at present, and 44 the man who would not
h r lp a woman in distress,” &e. &c., for particulars
see small bills. Now all this sentiment has been
worked up through reading the Alexandra
Standard, the editor of which has been thrown into
seventeen particular descriptions of fits through the
tyranny exercised by Schoolmaster Hearle over
his first assistant, a young and lovely creature
rejoicing in the euphonious name of Miss Annie
Doyle. Hearle bosses the section of the Education
department which is devoted to the instruction of
the rising generation of Alexandra. And may be
you’d like to know where Alexandra is to be found
on the map of Victoria. We’ll tell you. First and
toremost, you take the train from Melbourne, and
after a pretty long ride, you change the iron horse
for a pair of Cobb and Co.’s pacers, and then you
get jolted over rough roads, and across creeks, and
high hills, and deep ruts, and then if you’re lucky
enough to escape with only a couple of you! arms
broken and your ribs stove in, you go and stop at
Baker’s hotel, instead of going to the uospital. Then
you know that you are in Alexandra. We’ve been
there ourselves, and therefore ought to know. But
in our desire to impart solid geographical informa-
tion, we mustn’t lose sight of our heroine. For
two long and weary years she has endured the
highhanded and unexampled tyranny of that im-
perious pedagogue in comparative silence, but at
length she has given vent to her feelings in a letter
to the local Board of Advice, in which she patheti-
cally, if not vividly, sets forth her troubles. Hear
the heartrending wail of the young lady:— 44 1
complain bitterly of Mr. Hearle’s harsh and tyran-
nical treatment, which has at times been cruelly in-
sulting and persistently fault-finding. . . . Mr.
Hearle also thwarts me in my efforts to obtain dis-
cipline, which by reason of his treatment of me
before the children, makes it difficult for me to
maintain, thus adding greatly to the unpleasant-
ness of my position, making it indeed quite in-
tolerable—this seems to be Mr. Hearle’s object. . . .
the constant anxiety and harass are very injurious
to me, and it is becoming absolutely necessary that
l have relief from them; not only for my own sake
is this necessary, but the welfare of the school-
tor such a display of ill-feeling cannot but be in-
jurious to the children. Unless a change for the
better takes place, I fear I shall have to resign.
Reaving my case to your kindly consideration,
&c : Gf course, the other side of the question has
not been touched, and we wait with keen anxiety
Mr. Hearle’s version of the case. So far the
Hearley bird has been the suffering Miss D., who
metaphorically picks up the worm by having her
complaint first in the field. We were just about
to mention that our sympathies are over with the
W0 ak and oppressed, especially when associated
with female youth and loveliness, but reckoning
snat the Missus might take a sudden and aggressive
interest in ourselves, if she thinks that we wrote
this par., we’ll say no more.
There are men in England who own more
real property than Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt; but then
a is entailed, or tied up in various ways. In cash,
or convertible property, Vanderbilt Is far away
tne richest man in the world. He is reckoned up
at between 20 and 35 millions sterling. Fifty years
„ g ?.'. Joh . n Jacob Astor was undoubtedly the only
millionaire in America, and he was worth about
? ne million pounds. Now, there are probably a
nundred men in New York who own that much.
e w - B - Astor and A. T. Stewart both died
J?™ several millions. Jay Gould, the boldest
fancier in the world, »nd Russell Sage, the canni-
est old caution in Wall-street, are both away up
PfP iu riches, and own millions. Three genera-
jons of Vanderbilts will be recorded in history for
wealth. The founder was old Commodore
he . n< terbilt. We don’t know where he is now; but
nd worth diverging a moment to
beiate how he nearly died before he got all his
ff° ne y. and it was this way. He owned a
sailing vessels from New York to
int and . had J u8t sold one half
merest in them to Commodore Garrison, when
hni a was discovered in California. This made the
W PPortnously valuable, and Vanderbilt, repent-
.rfo* hls bargain, refused to complete the con-
ract papers. Garrison did all he could, but with-
in u ., a y, ai1 - So, one fine morning in 1850, he walked

W t3 i-tbe story himself. It was from him that
and 4 Vaader bilt, who now. 60 years of age, hale
sound, represents the second generation, in-
herlted a trifle of ten millions sterling; and
Madame, his wife, pays her cook £1400 a year.
The third generation is represented by his sons,
Cornelius, William K., Frederick, and George.
Cornelius is 33, a Christian, good-looking and smart.
He began commercial life as clerk in a broker’s
office, and passed through all the details of railw ay
management. He is director of countless rail-
roads, and the father of four lawful children.
William Kissam Vanderbilt is a good business man,
understands railroads, and loves horses and whist.
His connubial quiver at present, contains three of
Cupid’s shafts, and he has a mania for shining as a
society leader. Frederick and George are both
nobodies in particular, only that they are Vander-
bilts, and therefore recognisable as sons of the
man who “damned the public,” and grandsons of
America’s first huge millionaire, ninety cents of
whose every dollar was got by crooked ways.
The Vanderbilt fortunes, like all other great ones,
have been built up on principles that impoverish
the many to enrich the few. Families may starve
and hearts may break, wc rkers be driven to the
wall, and honesty go want; but none throw these
things in the face of the man who brings them to
pass—when he has 25 millions. At every turn let
the masses be victimised that the millions may in-
crease.
The Dukedom of Grafton—which has pro-
duced for the benefit of Fngland that splendid
hereditary legislator, Lord Euston. who can’t get
divorced from Lady Euston, alias Kate Cook, the
ex-prostitute—has, since it was founded, cost the
British tax-payer, in pensions alone, £1,115,850.
Charles II. accepted the responsibility of the
paternity of the first Duke, albeit he wasn’t at all
confident about the matter himself, and everybody
else was exceedingly doubtful. The maternal
ancestress of the House of Grafton was very much
on a par with the probable next Duchess, nie Cook.
What this “ noble ” family has cost the nation
besides, Lord only knows. A short account of its
ancestress and founder will be interesting just
now. Barbara Villiers was daughter and heiress
of Viscount Grandison. She married a Mr, Palmer,
and managed to get the King, Charles II., to sleep
with her the very night after his arrival in London,
on being restored to the throne. Charles created
Palmer Viscount Castlemaine, but he disdained
the sop, and separated from his worthless wife.
Thereupon, the King created her Baroness Non-
sueh (1), Countess of Southampton and Duchess of
Cleveland. During the King’s life she had six
children, all of whom he “ ennobled.” Whether
they were his is a matter of speculation. Bishop
Burnet says that at a time when the Duke of
Buckingham kad fallen out with the Duchess of
Cleveland, and temporarily distracted Charles’ in-
clinations by throwing Davis and Nell Gwynne
in his way, Barbara abandoned herself to ‘great
disorders, one o f which was, by the Duke of
Buckingham’s contrivance, discovered by the
King himself, “the person” escaping by the win-
dow. Sam Pepys has a good deal to say about
, this fair fountain of the Grafton ducal honour.
1611, November 4, he notes “ To the Privy Seale,
an*t sealed there; and, among other things that
passed, there was a patent for Roger Palmer
(Madame Palmer’s husband), to be Earl of Castle-
maine and Baron of Limbriche[? Limerick.—Ed.B.]
in Ireland ; but the honour is tied up to the males
got of the body of this wife, the Lady Barbary ;
the reason whereof everybody knows.” Again,
1667,29th July “ My Lady Castlemaine hath made
a bishop lately, namely, her uncle, Dr. Glenbam ;
a drunken, swearing rascal, and a scandal ,to the
church.” About this time a scandalous thing hap-
pened. In February, 1688, London apprentices
had the insGent bad taste and contempt for con-
stituted authority to riotously pull down a number
of brothels, not sparing two in which the Duke of
York, the King’s brother, had an indirect interest,
as they paid him £15 a year wine license. This
was nearly as bad as though some insolent people
to-day were to destroy in Westminster some of the
brothels from which the Dean and clergy of the
Cathedral partially derive their incomes. But the
’prentices of 1688 were a bad lot. They not merely
pulled down the Duke’s brothels, but insolently
said that they had made a mistake in being con-
tent to pull down the little brothels, meaning
that the Royal Palace was a big one. And to ag-
gravate the occasion a Bulletin of the day, in
>he lorm of a broadsheet, appeared, and wasn’t
“ wholesome fun ” at all. Pepys says “ I do now
hear that my Lady Castlemaine is horribly
vexed at the late libell, the petition of the
poor prostitutes about the town, whose houses
were pulled down the other day. 1 have
got one of them; and it is not very witty, but
devilish severe against her and the King; and I
wonder how it durst be printed and spread abroad,
which shows that the times are loose.” Dear old
Sam writes in the spirit ot an R. B. Smith here.
They evidently needed a Judge Manning in those
days to suppress satires upon worthy institutions
like Clontarf or Lady Castlemaine. We haven’t
space for moralizing, or for further quotations from
Sam Pepys. We must finally salute the Ducal
family ot Grafton, whose lovely and charming an-
cestress has suggested all this gossip. She had six
children. No. 1 was created Duke of Southampton
and afterwards of Cleveland. No. 2 was created
Duke of Grafton, and was the ancestor of Lord
Euston (God bless his noble heart) I No. 3 was
created Duke of Norfolk. No. 4 was a girl, and
married the Earl of Sussex. No. 5, also a girl,
married SirE. W. Lee of Lichfield. No. 6 turned
nun. The fair Duchess herself, after the King’s
death, married “Handsome Fielding,” an Adonis
who walloped her. She had too much spirit to
submit, however, and prosecuted him for bigamy I
It is obviously from her that the Grafton Fltzroys
inherit their tremendous cheek. Queen Anne
pardoned Fielding, and this instance of Royal in-
difference to the rights of the nobility seems to
have broken the old Duchess’s heart, tor she died
shortly after in 1709. Kate Cook seems, therefore,
after all, a very appropriate wife for Barbara
Villiers’ descendent, and a woman admirably fitted
to revive in the Grafton race its original “ noble
qualities.”

Ladies, you‘have conquered. Even that
stronghold of masculine conservatism, the Oxford
University, has succumbed. After a heroic strug-
gle. though. The proposal to give women the same
examination as men, has been carried by a l&rge
maiority. The female relations of the erudite
voters had a good deal to do with this victory, or
we are much mistaken. There is a poor time coming
for men if this new doctrine of women s rights is
allowed to develop much more. The mistake we,
the lords of creation, made was to have allowed
the sex, facetiously called “ softer, to think they
have any rights at all. If we do not take pretty
prompt measures to nip this notion in the bud, we
shall soon be relegated to the camp-oven and the
wash-tub, while our wickeder halves spend the
money that was to have kept the house and paid
the rent, in playing skittles and shaking in the hat
—or bonnet, should we say? -for drinks. And then
in the usual course of things, a female bailiff will
be put in, and we shall have to feed heron
oysters, and fresh eggs, and fill her up with beer,
while our wives are out “seeing a woman
to try and square up the debt. And when they
come home they will probably accuse iis of car-
rying on a clandestine flirtation with the bailiff.
This is just what it will come to. Imagine the
case of a man—one of your friends, say—whom you
meet on his way to the police court one morning.
He has a face as long as the Tichborne trial, and
a look of weary resignation in his eyes. You stop
him —you yourself are then on the way to the
corner hotel to fetch a flask of brandy home to
your spouse, who has been having rather too high
a time with the girls the night before-end ask
him where he is going. “ To the court, he replies
with a sigh. “ What, again ? “ you remark with
sorrowful surprise. “Yes, again, he answers,
“this is the third time in a fortnight I have bailed
her out. Then you both shake your heads, squeeze
each other’s hands with mournlul sympathy, and
you dive in into the bar for the flas*, while your
friend droops weari y down to the lock-up. res,
ladies, it is going to be your turn now, and we wish
you luck of it. Only we hope we shall be with the
sober and conservative dead before that day
comes round.

THE Postmaster - General desir s to impress
upon senders of letters the necessity that
exists for the addresses being legible and complete.
As regards Sydney and the larger towns, the num-
ber ©f the house and the name of the street should
in every case appear in the address ©t a letter, it
is found that a large number of letters are merely
addressed ‘•Sydney,” or to some street m Sydney,
without any further direction. This greatly re-
tards the sorting, and is liable to lead to the wrong
delivery of letters.
The Postmaster-Genrral trusts that, on their
attention being called to the matter, the public
will co-operate with the Department, as tar as
possible, in facilitating its business.

We like to go out on “benefit” nights.
The reason we like to go out on these occasions is
that the managers always look savage when they
see us appear with three dead-heads in tow; and
we like to see the managers look savage. Gener-
ally, they are so gentle and polite to us that the
bystanders imagine we wore born in the purple
and nursed into prettiness in the arms of Royalty.
When we frown they tremble, and when we
“ smile ” they “shout;” and between the two, our
cup is generally full. This is only between the
two, however. Immediately after, and just before,
our cup is as empty as the hollow mockery of a
publican’s prayer for Booth and blue ribbons. A
“benefit” always means a crowded house, if the
recipient is at all popular. There are a lot of play-
goers in this as in every great city, who go out
only on “ opening ” and “benefit” nights. These
people consider themselves “too utterly utt” to
attend a theatre on other occasions. You can
always tell them if you’ve had much experience.
There is a something about them that seems new
and fresh, or unusual, like our best frock coat
after we come home from a sea voyage and
take it out of our box. It is creased and wrinkled
and smells of cedar oil and saveloys. And that’s
the way with the “benefit” patron. As a rule,
benefits are given on a Wednesday or a Saturday
night in Sydney, for those are the suburban and
the fashionable nights here. But Sam Genese, of
the Opera House, has a head on him like Talleyrand
and a bow window that was made for fried fish and
baked potatoes. That is the reason he chose an “off”
night for Mrs. Polk’s “ benefit.” He was sure of a
crowded house on Saturday, for that was the
anniversary of John Brown’s death or something,
and the people were bound to crowd into the
theatres at night, to cheer them up after the day’s
mourning. In this instance, Sam’s foresight was
equal to most people’s hindsight. ’Twas the savee
ot years gave him lashins of lore, and he saw what
would happen a long time before, as Campbell said
in tipping Lochiel for a very important event.
Sam knew that everyone who could would attend
the favourite comedienne’s benefit, and so he
selected Friday night. The result must have been
highly satisfactory, for although it rained like
Helen Blazes, the Opera House was fairly filled,
and the applause was so uproarious at times, that
the patter on the roof seemed like the refrain of a
lost cat amidst the turmoil and din of a Glebe
Island sausage factory,
• • •
Perhaps you would like to know some-
thing about the play, and how it was performed.
The piece was “An American,” an original
comedy by Mr. Polk, in which the author has
undertaken to illustrate, by contrast, the differ-
ence between the free-and-easy ways of the
Nevada miner and the stiff and formal conven-
tionality of English aristocratic life. The first
scene opens upon the interior of a miner’s cabin
at a little station on the Central Pacific Railway,
in the mountains of Nevada. Two miners named
Pete and Hank (Messrs. Norman and Jones) are
indulging in what they call a game of “draw
poker.” They are presently joined by Gentleman
Jack (Mr. Boothman), an English blackleg, and
the play waxes hot. The only fault we have to
find with this scene is that the game is “ straight ”
instead of “draw” poker, and the players talk
entirely too much for Nevada gamesters. They
play poker like the Dutch play euchre, until Kit
Bright (Mr. Polk) appears on the scene and takes
a hand. He knows how to play poker in the
Nevada style. His short, crisp answers and
business-like manner indicate forthwith that he
has “ straddled ” more than one “ blind,” and has
raised many an “ ante ” before seeing a card. But
it wasn’t “draw ” poker, or, if it was, there were
more “pat” hands.around the board than any-
body ever heard tell of who hadn’t been “cold-
decked ” clean out of the country.
• •
As the game progresses, Lord Alfred Eger-
ton (Mr. Forbes), his sister. Lady Alice (Mrs.
Polk), and Johnson, her maid (Miss Lily Bryer),
who are on a tour through the States, stroll
into the cabin, having missed a train. A
quarrel ensues between Lord Egerton and
Gentleman Jack, with the result that “ my
Lord's” body is perforated by the dagger of the
blackleg. Kit Bright swears to avenge the mur-
der, and the curtain goes down on the lamentation
of tho bereaved ami the antics of Kit’s Chinese
servant. Three yeais later on the Bgertons are at
home in England, and Kit arrives on the scene.
He has got to be a millionaire by this time, but
the off-hand manner in which he tells the Countess
Egerton that she can “bet ver boots, mum,’’ is
prima facie evidence that coin and culture don’t
always go hand in hand. However, Kit’s heart is
in the right place, and so is his money, and he
winds up by identifying the murderer of Lord
Alfred and marrying the pretty Lady Alice.
* • •
There isn’t much plot in the piece, and at
first it drags slowly, and seems to hang fire; but
when you come in again with a mouthful of
cloves and just the suggestion of lemon rind on
your breath, and tell the girl beside you that you
have been to the box-office to consult the manager
on a subject of transcendental importance, you
feel better, and the play seems to have more
vim and vinegar in it. We like Mr. Polk’s
make-up as the Nevada Miner, but at times
be is rather too clownish. The typical Nevada
man is a very determined, cool-headed fellow, who
goes straight to thj point on all occasions, and
neither indulges in nor tolerates any foolishness.
And his vernacular is just a little different from
Mr. Polk’s. If you tell a Nevada man “ It’s a
nice day, stranger,” he will at once reply “ That’s
what it is.” If he is on his way into town, and you
ask him if he is going to the city, he replies
“ That’s what I am. He always puts the copula
last, but Mr. Polk evidently didn’t stay long
enough in the great Silver State to learn this
peculiar style of transposing the English language.
And we were disappointed that Kit didn’t blow
the top of Gentleman Jack’s head off before he got
away aft;r stabbing Lord Egerton. As a rule Ne-
vada men are rather handy with their “guns,” as
the navy revolvers are called amongst them, and
they o'ten amuse themselves by shooting flies ©ff
the ends of each other’s noses. The man who can't
pick the fly off without abrading the skin is looked
upon as a disgracefuly poor marksman, and he
generally gets a caution immediately after his first
mistake.
• • •
Mr. Boothman’s Gentleman Jack would be vastly
better if the actor did not always adopt the style
of a stump orator—in declamation, in dialogue, in
love scenes, everywhere. The blackleg, who gets
his education in the Rocky Mountains, is not a
swaggerer nor a blusterer. The man who could
stab another in cold blood with the accompanying
risk of being killed on the spot, or hanged to the
nearest tree, is certainly not a character from
whom to expect bluster and blow.
• • •
Mr. Ed. Lester’s Wan Lung is a capital piece of
acting, and yet there are weak points about the
character that should be remedied at once. Was
Lung is entirely too honest for a Nevada China-
man. He doesn’t steal anything, and doesn’t seem
inclined to appropriate the property of others.
He looks like a thief, however, and when he
first came on, we had a suspicion that he
was the copper-coloured heathen who picked
the gold-filling out of our front teeth after
inducing us to “hit the pipe” so hard that we
didn't wake up for seventeen straight hours. Wan
shows the true Mongolian instinct, however, by
winning all the money of the English butler,
aellers (Mr. Stewart), at the game of draw-poker,
Which he has taught his victim to play. Sellers
holds four aces, and, of course, stakes his last shil-
bng on a hand of that sort; but his discomfiture is
complete when the heathen lays down five kings
mid collars the pot. This is the one redeeming
teature about Wan Lung. The author has happily
developed in this role the penchant which Coina-
men have for imitating 1 whatever they see. Our
landlady once engaged a Chinese cook, and set
about teaching him to make a cake. Into the flour
she broke three eggs, and had to throw an extra
one away because there was too much meat in it,
or something. After preparing the dough, she put
it in the ov en, and, forgetting it, allowed the cake
to burn almost to a cinder. On the following day,
John was requested to make a cake for company
just as he had seen the missus do it. John was faith-
fulness itself. He broke two eggs into the flour,
threw the third one into the coal-hole, and put the
fourth along with the first two. Then he put the
cake in the oven, and left it there until it was
as thoroughly burnt as the one he had seen made
on the previous day. Wan Lung is the same sort
of an imitator—and the coolness with which he
appropriates Sellers’ uniform is only another evi-
dence that a Chinaman is a mighty hard party to
nonsuit. And just here we are reminded of a
little Mongolian we once knew when in ’Frisco.
* * *
Little Ah Sid
Was a Chinaman kid—
A cute little cuss, you’d declare —
With eyes full of fun.
And a nose that begun
Right up at the roots of his hair.
Jolly and fat
Was this frolicsome brat,
As he played through the long summer day,
And braided his cue
As his father used to,
In Chinaland far, far away.
Once o’er a lawn
That Ah Sid played upon
A bumble bee flew in the spring;
“ Mclican butterfly,”
Said he, winking an eye;
“ Me catchee and pull off um wing.”
So with his cap
He struck it a rap,
This innocent bumble bee,
And put its remains
In the seat of his jeans, —
For a pocket there had the Chinee.
Down on the green
Bat the little sardine,
In a style that was strangely demure,
And said with a grin.
That was brimful of sin,
“ Me mashee um butterfly sure.”
Little Ah Sid
Was only a kid.
Nor could you expect him to guess
The kind of a bug
He was holding so snug
In the folds of his loose-fitting dress.
“Ki-yil ki-yunel”
He cried to the moon,
As he hurriedly rose from that spot:
“Ki-yi! Yuk-a-kanI
Dam a Melican man,
Um butterfly welly much hotl ”
• • •
Mr. Stewart’s Sellers could scarcely be
better taken. There isn’t much in the part, but
the young artist makes it up so well that it be-
comes a very pleasing feature of the play. Mrs.
Polk, as Lady Alice, was as captivating as an
oyster pie and three glasses of stout on a frosty
morning. Miss Ruth Gray’s Lady Edith was also a
clever bit of acting, but how she ever came to fall
in love with such an old duffer as Captain Vaniker
is a left-handed conundrum that will never be
solved to the satisfaction of anybody. But we
have stayed long enough with the Polks, who play
their farewell engagement in the Australian
colonies at the Opera House, on Friday evening.
May 30. And now we shall go up to the Gaiety to
see what Wybert Keeve is up to.

Of course, you will want to know some-
thing about “ The Money Spinner.” That is the
name of the new piece put on at the Gaiety last
Saturday evening for a week’s run. Is it worth
anything? Yes, it is. It is worth going to see,
and that is saying considerable for a modern
drama In three acts. Most of the dramas of recent
origin are as flat and insipid as a cold potato boiled
in the skin. “The Money Spinner,” however,
embraces a number of good characters, and they
an interest in the future of every man who under-
takes to either edify or instruct the public from
the mimic stage.
* * *
Maggie Knight, as the Money Spinner, is
just too pretty and captivating to talk about. We
often wonder whether Maggie ever smiles. If she
does, it must be when she’s off the stage, for we
have never seen her on the boards when she wasn’t
steeped in more misery and surrounded by more
woe than any other actress in Australia, except the
great buck-jump tamer of the Theatre Royal, and
Signora Majeroni who plays Camille. How Maggie
manages to endure all the wear and tear to her
system that must result from so much trouble and
tribulation, is more than we can guess. Maggie s
Millicent is quite as true a piece of acting as we
have yet seen her do, and makes a strong support
for Mr. Reeve’s Croodle.
• • •
Mr. Coleman played the Tout so well that
we felt like braining him with a shovel. He made
us think of the man who told us he had a “ system”
to beat Faro. If we remember right, the “system”
was: Watch until the ace loses and is followed
by a losing king. Then bet the queen to win, and
you 11 never miss it.” That man was a deceiver.
We didn t miss it, but our boss did; and the only
thing that preserved our latch-key and our liberty
was the good pair of legs we had under us. We
are down on deception. We don’t believe in it,
and haven’t ever since the time we kicked a plug
hat with a brick under it.

And we must give Ethel Adele a hand. We
don’t like to deal all the time ourself, and so we’ll
let Ethel have a chance. Considering the fact
that she plays Dorinda Croodle, we wont’t ask a
fair deal from her, for that would ruin her father’s
business. We’ve been looking for an old man
with a Faro bank, and a daughter like Dorinda.
We found the bank several times, but the daugh-
ter wasn’t there. She was always out, and when
we came back again to squandersome more of our
boss s hard-earned money, she was in bed with neu-
are very well taken by the Gaiety staff. “The
kpmner” is Millicent Croodie (Miss Maggie Knight),
the daughter ©f a Parisian gambler, whose estab-
lishment is frequented by howling swells from all
garts of the country. Millicent is a veteran gam-
leress, whose good luck seems never to desert her
until after she has married Harold Boycott (Mr.
James Carden), a poor clerk at Rouen, who em-
hezzles his employer’s money. To save him,
Alia cent plays at icarte with Lord Kerngussie
(Mr. Appleton), a Scotch nobleman, who was her
tprmer lover. She cheats him and is detected, the
resultbcing barrels of sorrow and buckets of woe.
But he finally forgives her, and advances the
money necessary to free his more successful rivai
from the ugly embarrassment his folly has placed
him in, and the whole tiling ends like a fairy tale
got up to amuse children.
■
Mr. ReeA r e’s Croodie is one of the best im-
personations of which he has been guilty since hi?
return from England. It is not so powerful a
representation as his C->unt Foeco in “TheWoman
in White,” but it is a role that is well calculated to
bring out some of the strongest points as an actor
of which Mr. Reeve is possessed. The lines are so
funny at times, and Mr. Reeve's rendition of them
so droll, that you can’t resist the invitation of the
man behind you to go out between the acts.

Last week we had just about made up our

very little bit—and we want to give him credit.

everyday costume, and wear It off as much as on
the stage. It is certainly a great improvement on
the original Appleton as we have seen him in
several roles. This is not intended for sarcasm.
It is meant as a friendly suggestion to a man in

Yes, we sent our very funniest man to see the great sculling
match. Why he did no more on the subject than appears
above, may or may not be satisfactorily explained in the
sketch. Perhaps he may have thought that public interest
in the race did not warrant further outlay. Perhaps he had
alreaey spent his half-crown to the man who told him where
the “ Gorge ” was. We shall never know.


PEPPER AND SALT.
A Lismore lyrist has arisen and struck the
hoop-iron harp. Here are two lines from a poem
of his, printed in the local paper:
“We shall roam on the banks of the river of peace,
And bathe in the blissful tide.”
Which is as much as to say there are no policemen
in Heaven. Bathe in the blissful tide! If they
did they would probably get seven days for it.
And deservedly. Every grimy gospeller and
malodorous tub-thumper seems to think he can
put off washing until he goes to Heaven. At this
rate, heaven, instead of being paved with gold
would have to be paved with soap. And the
thrones of the elect would, of course, be combina-
tions of throne and bathing-machine. We are
afraid cleanliness will not be quite so near godli-
ness as all this. The Lismore lyrist will even have
to reconcile himself to washing in this world. Let
him face the peril like a man. It will come easy to
him after a year or two. By the way, talking of
ablution and Lismore, they say tha*, up there,
instead of washing, a man gets himself ringbarked
round the waist once a year. Then all the dirt
from the waist up cakes and falls off. We are not
prepared to guarantee the truth of this statement.
At least, not to a Lismore man.
You can believe this if you like. We don’t.
A country paper says that a shepherd was found
in a dying state near Greenwich Park (N.8.W.), the
other day. He had been lost in the bush for several
days, during whieh he had only mushrooms and
tobacco to live upon. Only! We have numbers
of shepherds in this city at the present time. They
are engaged in shepherding the statue of Albert
the Good, to keep it from stealing down from its
pedestal and going on a drunk. We may say here
that indications of such an intention have been
observed in the statue ever since it heard of the
death of John Brown. But this is irrelevant.
These shepherds live, for the most part, on
seditious speeches and old nails. No such luxuries
as mushrooms and tobacco for them. And we are
asked to believe that a man—and a shepherd, too—
was nearly dying on this diet. Why, all he needed
was rum—and while he had the tobacco he could
have made that, if water was handy—to be in a
perfect Shepherd’s Paradise. The fable is too
thin, sweet rustic!

What do you think is the latest British
invention ? A new order of colonial knighthood,
you will say at once. But it isn't. It is an electric
railway, upon which—if the laws of Nature do not
object—travellers will be conveyed at the rate of
200 miles an hour. The inventor is making a ter-
rible turkey-cock of himself over this little dis-
covery. Why, here—and we are not at all proud
about it—we have trams that will, occasionally,
carry you further in five minutes. They will carry
you into eternity. But they never give us credit
for having any genius in the colonies.

One million acres of land. Only. It be-
longs to us. Mr. O'Donnell, the leader of the Kim-
berley Exploring Expedition—which last year tra-
versed a large area of the North-western district
of Western Australia—owned this little paddock.
He tried to sell.it in lots, but failed. Then he
withdrew it from the market, saying that he was
“ in a position to dispose of it in one lot, and to
better advantage.” We were the party. We
wanted it for a graveyard. Poets, of course.
* * *
The London Times— we are obliged to call
it the London Times, to distinguish it from the
Queanbeyan Times— never does the fair thing
for Australian literary talent. It says:—“We
have Wilkie Collins for plots, Mr. Black for sun-
sets, Mr. Howells and Mr. James for unrivalled
painters in miniature, and Ouida for emotions, but
we have not a novelist equal to those of the days
of Thackeray and George Elliot.” And what
about Henniker Heaton ? Is he nobody ? Does
the British nation forget the deadly perils he went
through in carrying the damaged-pork-despatches?
Has he written a full and flashing account of this
desperate deed, or has he not ? Of course he has:
and it is only minds darkened with narrow and
besotted prejudice that could fail to see therein
the traces of a literary grasp that would place him
far above Thackeray or any other, if he were weak
enough to listen to popular clamour, and take up
the pen of romance. But he is not—thank God!
Then how about Harold Stephen—the delight of the
delicious shepherd, the pride of the profane but
cultivated bullock-puncher? We have seen a
story of his which has been running in the back-
block journals for the last hundred years. When
they have printed it through in the usual way they
begin again at the end and print it backwards.
And it reads just as well either way. We would
like to see your George Eliot who could write
like this. We say nothing about Lewis Scott. He
is now a municipal magnate, and, naturally, above
authorship. But what a genius he was before he
gave up unsubstantial literary fame for solid
aldermanic glory I These are not all, nor half—
but they are enough to show the London Times
that the reading public need not go about with a
dark lantern looking for successors to Thackeray
and George Eliot.

Just listen. A Riverina squatter has lately
rented a well in a corner of his run to another
squatter for £100 a week. This is about ten times
the rent of a first-class hotel. Where is your
whisky now ? There is a splendid opportunity for
one or two of your Parliamentary orators to
become suddenly affluent out there. There is
water enough on their brains to fetch twice that
rent in a dry season.

A Victorian paper says that natives of the
colonies are born pressmen. We suppose this
means they have “ nothing on them ” when they
come into the world. Or, perhaps it means that
they take to drink as soon as they are old enough
to stagger. Anyhow, if they are born pressmen,
most of them seem to die early. In Victoria, that
is.

“Non-sequitur” Smith, the member for
the Maeleay, laid it down in the Assembly the
other evening, with infinite pathos, that if the
House refused barristers and attorneys admission
to the Land Court, they should, to be consistent,
do the same in connection with other courts, and
so do away with the rights and privileges of the
People. Verily, there is nothing like leather, or
rather (as Smith would say) like brass! Barrister 8
and attorneys are entities essential to the rights
and privileges of the People, in the gospel accord-
ing to R. B. Smith; in our gospel, they constitute
the pioneers of the brigade which the Power of
Evil employs to set men by the ears. So far has
the legal pundit caste got astray from the proper

claim to possessing the key to the unintelligible.
We should like to see the father of lies strangling
the last attorney with the tongue and trachea of
the last barrister. Then, dear Cupid, there’d be
some chance of the People enjoying their rights

Diner en tele is the new French idea. All
guests receiving a card with the words en tele, are
bound to come with their heads in fancv costume.
That is all is required of them. It strikes us that
this style might be acclimatised here with advan-
tage. Why not go en tete to a Ministerial banquet ?
The Premier would only require to knot his hair
on the top to represent, say, Apollo. Ninian Mel-
ville would need no disguise to represent a brass
foundry. David Buchanan would only have to
borrow another head to go as Carlyle. As for Dan
O’Connor, he need not be put to much expense for
headdress. Simply a little garnishing of parsley
round his Ciceronian brow. And so on. We will
take refreshment now.;
Joy for the Jews. Thirteen American
millionaires have started a firm to rebuild the
Temple of Jerusalem, in defiance of all the pro-
phecies against it. You will recollect the last at-
tempt to do this—in the reign of the Emperor
Julian, sometimes called the Apostate — was
what you might call a “frost.” The workmen
were driven away by miraculous balls of fire
and Chinese crackers that sprang out of the
ground at their feet. This terrible warning has no
effect on those mad Americans, however. We cer-
tainly think their undertaking is a high and
hallowed one; but if they build the Temple, we
suppose they will present it to the Chosen Race.
And, if they do, you can lie down to the sinless
slumbers of a child, with the certain conviction
that the Chosen Race will turn it into a monster
Mont de Pieta, before they have it two days.

We will give you this humorous story just
as we got it. It is chattering idiocy, of course, but
we want you to read it, so that when you are on
your death-bed you will make your son, if you
have one, take a terrible vow that he will never,
under any circumstances, become an editor. If
the author of our being had only exacted such a
vow from us, we might now have been happily,
and even lucratively, employed at roost-robbing.
But his giant intellect was too much devoted to
sampling whisky to afford time to bother about
us. Here is the item, anyhow: “ Amongst a num-
ber of visitors to the Botanical Gardens, lately,
were two matrons, who, with others, resorted
there with their children for a day’s outing, and to
give the youngsters an opportunity of amusing
themselves feeding the ducks, swans, etc. While
they were thus occupied, a shower came on, and
they were obliged to take shelter under a large
tree. While there, a very amusing scene occurred,
in which two ‘ mashers ’ got a great sell. Happen-
ing to be in close proximity to one of the
matrons, who had a little girl in her arms.
No. 1 masher commenced talking to the child
and kissing her, evidently thinking the lady was
the nurse. Presently the band struck up, and the
little girl said, ‘ Where’s the music, mamma ? *
This exclamation caused the fellow to draw back,
and look quite sheepish. Then his companion No.
3exclaimed, ‘Mamma, aye; what a sell!’” Now,
do you wonder that we get up in the “ dead vast
and middle of the night,” and on bended knees
beseech Providence to spare our reason ? What
would you do if you were running a paper with
some slight pretensions to humour, and a man seat
you a thing like that, at the same time enclosing a
note saying, “ Herewith is a small item which I
hope will add to the news in your journal ?” To
Hercules and the Hydra.
Respectfully dedicated to Sir Alfred Stephen, and whom it may concern.


•would simply lock your door, swallow the key, and
have a wild saturnalia of gore to yourself for the
next four hours. And when the neighbours broke
in the door in tho morning, they would find you
sitting like the corpse of a coroner on the bodies of
all your family. But we have too much self
command to indulge the wishes of our heart after
this fashion. The most we do when we get an item
like the one in question is to go out and poison the
office-boy. No enquiry is ever made about office-
boys. We use up, on an average, about one a
week. They die of desiccation through licking
stamps, or else get mixed up in the machine to such
an extent that It is not worth while to stop it in
order to extricate them; or, failing these ways of
finishing themselves, they stand on their heads till
the paste they have eaten surreptitiously flies to
their head—and they want to write verses. Then,
of course, their end is at hand. We have had a
man employed for some time sinking a shaft to be
us6d as a corpse-pit. Last we heard of him he had
(jot pretty close down to the apartments occupied
by Judas. But we are digressing. Anyhow, all
we have to say is that the corpse-pit is always hos-
pitably open for the man who sent us the above
item, any day he can spare time to call round.

They have all the luck of it in Bega. If a
calf with three heads is to be born, Bega is the
happy spot Fate chooses for its birthplace. If a
cabbage grows to three times its normal size, or a
hen lays a monster egg with a copper coin of the
reign of King Billy of Corandarrk inside it, the
Bega editors know it before the rest of the world.
So that it does not much surprise us to find that
they have, or had, another gorgeous grotesque
down there. But let the local paper tell it :—
Months ago a mechanic left Bega in debt. Things
ran down hill with him ; his business head was
eccentric, and though a long way from an idiot, he
was never able to draw the right change out of his
assets, so he said a modest ‘ adieu ’ to creditors, and
sailed for foreign climes. Recently, one of those
who had always believed in his intentions to pay
if possible, received a consignment of merchan-
dise, with instructions to pass value to his credit-
Let us write It up ; honesty Is not yet dead.” And
now it appears that the consignment the creditor
received turned out to be pills. Timeo Danaos et
dona ferentes. We will have the same again, thank
you.

You all know about Mr. Dick and King
Charles’s head, of course. Well, it is much the
same with Alfred. Speaking of commercial in-
terests, that gifted journalist says, in his own
Inimitable manner, “ They’re like a sheep’s trotter;
they’re a little shaky at times”’ The full meaning
of this elegant simile may not be grasped by the
general public, but they can be sure it is exact.
Trust Alfred to know all about a sheep’s trotter-
Strange, though, isn’t it, that even in the report
of a sermon, an allusion to trotters or sausages or
pies cannot be kept out? Alfred may be said to
be the master of the appetising style of literature,
and the greatest authority now living on the
common saveloy.

There is joy among jurymen up at Camden.
They now get nineteen shillings a day for their
services. Everybody wants to be a juryman up
there now; and we have even heard it said that
where there is a large family in somewhat pallid
circumstances, the honest toll-worn father gets
one of his sons to assault him, and then takes an
action. The other sons get paid as witnesses, and
the friends of the family go on the jury, and share
the spoil with the old man. This we do not believe.
Neither do we believe another statement we
have heard to the effect that one aged resi-
dent who had never got out of bed for
fifteen years, was in the front seat at court
on the day they raised the scale of payment*
But here is a thing that is certain. A resident of
that township charged another with
shoot him a short time back. The case was tried
and the defendant was discharged. About an
hour after, he and the prosecutor were discovered
in a bar weeping on each other’s shoulders! They
have a very good sample of Christianity at Cam-
den. Also lies.

Country editors are curious people. That
is, some are. But <me particularly. We forget the
name of his paper just now, and we also forget
where it is published. What of that, though ?
Nobody will ever be interested In knowing his
record—except, perhaps, the undertaker. They
put your name, and the date of your birth, and all
that sort of thing on breastplates now, don’t they ?
It is so long since we were last buried that these
little details have quite escaped our memory.
However, this “edition of Moses and Solomon
both ” Seems to have heard that the army authori-
ties at home are going to abolish the feather
bonnet worn by the Highland regiments. He is
averse to this, but, if it must be, he will submit.
He suggests an iron pot, with eagle feathers, as a
substitute. Why not a porridge stick ? It might
not be so picturesque or poetical, but it would be
a sight more serviceable. Imagine the simple yet
noble grandeur of a thousand kilted warriors
making gruel in their helmets! The real beauty Of
the plau is this, though. In case of a sudden attack
by the enemy, the gallant Gaels could clap on their
helmets, gruel and all, and defy the devil. For
while they had the gruel in their helmets, who would
know their brains were knocked outl Not them-
selves, even. We think this is a masterly concep-
tion. The country editor insists upon the iron
head-piece. This is too much like self-conscious-
ness. Still it is only natural for him to think the
head the weakest part of the human ac atomy.
Why feathers in the pot, though ? But what is the
use of asking ? For our own part, we don’t care a
grain of oatmeal what feathers our soldiers show,
so long as they don’t show the white feather The
rustic scribe we are writing about is. by the way,
the only man living who has successfully bearded
Bismarck. Some time ago, he (the scrit e> showed
up the whole of that wily statesman’s policy—gave
him clean away, in fact. In revenge for this, Bis-
marck is said to have sent out an emissary with
instructions to poison the editor with a German
sausage. Now, every country editor, from the
Yarra to Yorke’s Peninsula, is showing up Bis-
marck. They ail want to be poisoned with sau-
sages.

As a rule, church music is j ather sick just
now in Sydney, and some of, the irreverent flatly
declare that they’ll take the risk of what h—1 Is
like in the next world rather than stand the
musical torments dealt out in this. “ One of the
tortured ” sends along the following truthful tale.
Not long ago, some heartless wretch caught half a
dozen cats, mildly chloroformed them, and then
tied all their tails together, and slung them into an
old cellar underneath a certain church, on a
Sunday evening. Everything went along smoothly
until about the middle of the sermon, when
the cats came to, and began to let off their respec-
tive warwhoops and go for each other’s entrails
This broke the preacher’s sermon all to pieces, and
during one of the temporary lulls in the battle he
sternly called out, “ Will the choir please wait till
its services are required ? ” The choir indignantly
denied making any noise, and finally, after a long
search, one ot the church-wardens found the cats
and lifted them out on the toe of his number
nines. Everybody is laughing, fit to split, at the
cnoir, of course: and the hatred which the organist
and his crowd bear for their beloved pastor is only
equalled bv the maniac fury of the oid maiden
lady who owned the cats. 1 hat's our church cor-
respondent’s yarn. For our poor parts, we con-
sider it to be a wilful and malicious libel on—the
cats.

ralgia. Somebody Is always getting ahead of us.
But we don’t feel well this morning, and are going
to get as far away from Gaiety and its Money-
spinners as possible.

Perhaps you think it’s fun to trip around
to the theatres every night. That shows your in-
experience. When we were young, we used to
save up pennies and steal eggs to get money
enough to go to a show. Now we never go, ex-
cept when the managers send us around a carriage
and two spanking bays. This happens about four
times a week, so, of course, we haven’t as much
time for devotion as is consistent with the high
piety everybody notices on the end of our nose.
We are tired, to-night, and are not going to stay
long at the Minstrels. Every time we go there
Sam Keenan and Horace Bent make us laugh so
that we have to reach out for the kerbstone next
morning to steady us and keep us from rolling
out of bed.
• » *
We don’t know what is the matter with
Sam Keeoan, but every time we look at him we
have to laugh. There is something so unmistak-
ably droll in the expression of his face and the
roll of his eye that we can’t help it, and don’t want
to. Oh, by the way, we’re going to tell you some-
thing about Keenan that j ou didn’t know. He’s
married, and has got the prettiest little boy that
ever cut a tooth or bit his mother. We wouldn’t
tell this on Sam, only he has been telling the girl
we wanted to get acquainted with that we are a
common shoemaker, and have a wife and seven
children over in Adelaide. When a man tells lies
on us like that, we always get even with him.
Tkis is thrown out as a warning to several
people, who haven’t told the truth about
us for six weeks at least. And, come to think of it,
we don’t know that we care to have the truth told
all the time. The last man who threatened to do
that, sleeps at the bottom of a shaft up in Queens-
land. We sent him down in the cage to look for
fresh indications, and forgot to pull him up until
the case had been heard, and we were discharged.

Fred Hisoocks began to smile as soon as he
saw us the other night. We’re not going to tell
you what he was smiling about, or you wouldn’t
let us rest until our last week’s salary had all been
spent in champagne and things. But he was
smiling all the same, and said that he would help
us to pound the fellow who pinned a placard
with the words “ Unemployed, and dam hungry ”
to the tail of our coat We haven’t felt so
mean since we put a fellow reporter to sleep in
a coffin at an undertaker’s shop one night, and got
kicked all over the place for our pains next morn-
ing. some people never can appreciate philan-
thropy, and our missionary efforts are completely
misconstrued. Fred is great on grammar, you
know, and so we asked him which was proper to
say—“ Gentlemen, what will you have to drink ? or
what will you have to drink, gentlemen ?” He said he
thought a man should say—“ What will you have to
drink, gentlemen ?” and we thought so, too ; but
when we said whisky, he acted as though he
wanted to kick about something. A few minutes
later, we met Smythe, and said to him: “If you
had ten pounds in your pocket and we were to ask
you to lend us five pounds, how much would you
have left?” “Ten pounds,” said Smythe, without
a wrinkle ; and now we are hunting for the villain
who told us that that conundrum would catch
anybody before a crowd.

We intended to tell you a lot about
Horace Bent and Mr. Porter, and Lou Braham and
Carroll, and Held and Emery, but we haven’t time
.just now. After we had told youlthat Leopold
Jordan has written a farce entitled “ Westward
Hoi” the motif of which is to burlesque “East-
ward Hoi” which Mr. Polk took off so unex-
pectedly at the Opera House, the other night.
“Westward Hoi” has a number of good points
about it, and for that reason we’ll have to let it
alone, it isn’t bad enough to deserve our con-
sideration, and so we'll go out with Mr. Jordan
and see if he knows enough to say something with
a wet at the end of it.

“Impulse” is still running at the Royal*
We like impulse in some places, but not in others-
The piece was written by Mr, B. C. Stephenson,
and the plot is made up of materials that happened
a long time B.C. There is any quantity of dramatic
situations, and the interest never flags; and yet
we don’t like the moral of the plot. The worst
thine- about it is the second act, in which Victor
de Riel, the French villain (Mr. Philip Day), in-
duces Mrs. M’Donald (Miss Annie Mayor) to leave
her home and slope for sunny France along with
him. Victor goes about his work with such an
intelligent intensity that the poor woman can’t
help herself, and you feel that you either want to
kill somebody or be a villain yourself. Sara Bern-
hardt carried the idea ont to a far greater length
when she was playing the piece in Paris. She
actually disrobed oo the stage, when her husband,
Col. M’Donald, appeared on the scene.
* * *
We don’t know why authors should get
up sensational plays that teach no lesson. After
you have set out a piece like “ Impulse,” and have
had your system all torn up just to see an actor
like Mr. Flemming indulge in solid yet stupid misery
and an actress like Annie Mayor weep her soul
away in vain regret, you go home and bang
your head against tne wall, and declare that
your brother-in-law is not the only blood relation
who was born an idiot. If Ouida had written the
play, we should praise it, for she is naughty
enough for anything, and, withal, is exceedingly
frank about it; and we like frankness. It doesn’t
cost us anything, and it the fellow says right out
that he hasn’t got it on him, we don’t waste our
time telling him a long story about our brother’s
death and how much we’ve got to pay for funeral
expenses.
* * »
Mr. Flemming’s Colonel M’Donald is well
taken. He usual' y puts a little lemon in it, we
believe, but you like it just as well raw. The only
thing we don’t like about him is the fact that he
runs away to the war in South Africa, and leaves
his young wife at home exposed to all the dangers
that beset a pretty and fascinating young woman
whose nature pines for tenderness and gentle
sentiments. If Edith were our wife, there never
was a war big enough to keep us from home
twenty-four hours at a time.
* * *
Maggie Moore’s impersonation of the dash-
ing Mrs. Beresford is just to our liking. Mrs.
Beresford is so bright and pretty that you wonder
how any' man of gumption could go off and die and
leave a woman like that. They say that matches are
made in heaven. Some of them are made in Sweden,
according to the label on the last lot we “ cadged.’*
But Mrs. Beresford’s match was made somewhere
else. It was a sort of “ safety” arrangement, that
strikes only on its own box, and doesn’t smell of
sulphur. Annie Taylor’s Miss Kilmore is also a
finished piece of actinsr, considering the lines. We
like an exaggerated character sometimes, but Mias
Kilmore suits us entirely too well. And this leads
us along to wonder why it is that playwrights
nearly always over-draw. When they have an old
maid to present, they make her out to be a man-
hunting, gossiping,meddlesome old vagabond,that
you instinctively want to cut a hole in the ice and
drown yourself to get rid of. If they paint a
murderer, they paint him so black that a nigger
would heave all over him if he touched him with
either hand, if it is a gentleman, they get him up
so faultlessly, and make him talk so nice, that you
feel like clubbing your paternal ancestors because
you weren’t born in the same family. If it is a
thief that’s wanted, they bring you one that a
watch dog wouldn’t bark at for fear of pounded
glass in the next piece of beef that may be thrown
to him. And so it is all through the list of dram-
atic personages. The Irishman is always drunk ;
the German is always full of saur-kraut and slug-
gish humour ; the American is for ever off-hand,
clownish, and uncultivated, and the Englishman is
so confoundedly conservative and distant that
you hesitate about borrowing his tooth-brush
when making your morn'ng toilet. We are going
to write a play some time that won’t be over-
drawn. We used to be guilty of over-drawing
once, but we don’t do it any more. The boss ha
taught us different. One morning he came in with
hlood in his eye, and asked us what in thunder we
wanted with that last 20-pound note. We scorned
to tell him, and now to avoid such annoying ques-
tions, we borrow what we want from another
man, who has heard, somewhere, that we are
occasionally the victim of a remittance from
home.

We thought about touching up Bennett

He tried it once, and ha jn’t been able to find the

Mrs. Dr. Potts, lor whom Major Waugh is advance
agent, is to begin a seas< m of lectures at the Opera
House next Monday evening. We are going—not
because we want to learn anything about medi-
cine or hygiene, but because we want to pay some-
thing to hear a woman sco'd once. In the mean-
time, we are going to the Minstrels, and you may
come along it you’ve got the price of a couple of
M'Kenzie’s draughts about you.

On Saturday nights the Opera House is to
be the scene of a genuine benefit—that is to say,
genuine in its inception; in its results it should be
genuine, also. Mr. Wilson’s three years’ lease of
the House has expired, and a small band of friends,
led to action by A. Huenerbein and Charles
Huenerbein, have organised a complimentary per-
formance. The patronage of Personages has
been applied for and readily granted, and the
“ perfesh ” is going to roll up with one accord.
Mr. Wiison deserves the best sort of benefit.
Under his management, the Opera House has
been brought to a front place among Sydney
theatres, and a succession of excellent entertain-
ments, by stars of real brilliancy, has been pro-
vided for the public. This fact should induce
play-goers to throng the house on Saturday, and
give Mr. Wilson a bumper; and if the principle of
personal appreciation be insufficient, the quality
and variety of the performances volunteered by
members of the profession will constitute an
attraction of itself. Since Mr. Wilson undertook
the direction of the Opera House, there has been
no better conducted place of amusement in Aus-
tralia.
THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN
NOSE.
A CHAPTER OF CHINESE HISTORY.
After a long and dissolute reign, Kang Chi ?
the last of the dynasty of Chow, fell by the dagger
of an assassin; and Kung Kl, the founder of the
dynasty of that name, wielded the royal chopsticks
over the rice-pots of the Imperial palace in
Pekin. This was in the ever-memorable year
987, b.c., a time, it will be remembered, when, by
one of those tidal waves of revolution of which
history furnishes many examples, the Assyrian
and Babylonian Empires tottered to their fall;
when the great dominions of Mexico and Peru fell
from a state of unexampled glory, to become the
vassals of Patagonia, and, when young Ireland,
fresh risen from the deep, presented first her
emerald face to the light of day, and called for
Home Rule, and to h—1 with King William. With
the elevation of Kung Ki rose the spirits of a
down-trodden people, for they saw hope once
more for the nation. From Macao to the Gulf of
Pechele, and from the gates of Shanghai to the
foot of the Western Mountains, nothing was heard
but the joyous ring of the tom-tom, the click of
the festive chopstick, and the rattle of crackers,
while the air was laden with the millions or gaudy
kites with which that ancient people, as yet
ignorant of euchre and pin-pool, are wont to
beguile the hours until the Evening News comes
out and cheers them with its funeral rhyme. But
the treasury was empty. The costly expeditions
to subdue New Guinea and Australia-aithough
they had ended in the complete destruction of
two old civilisations, reducing them to a state of
barbarism of which we still see some examples—
had drained the exchequer without adding lustre
to the nation; and with the unforseen result of
causing strained relations with Japan, and a
threatened war with the haughty Government of
Norfolk Island, beat on retaining her supre-
macy in the Southern Seas. On the day of
his accession, Ki proclaimed that it was
his Intention to rule constitutionally, and
Immediately called Parliament together. The
Mandarins, who purchased their seats;at public
an^ti f ' n - in the great hall of the palace,
and [took their places in silence. The ladies in the
gaiieiy their feet for a moment’s
ease, and impatiently awaited the advent of the
Emperor. The silvery tones of the court flute
heralded his approach. There was no mistaking
its tones, the holes of the flute having been bored
by the Emperor’s own hand, in the approved style
of Chinese instrument-makers, viz.—in with your
gimlet in the softest place, and hang the distance
apart. The King says it’s music, and the people
are happy. The speech from the throne was brief :
“My children,” said His Majesty, “when I,went
down to the kitchen this morning, the rice bag was
empty. Fill it.” With these words His Majesty
was helped on to the back of a dragon, and glided
in regal dignity from the hall to finish a game of
fantan interrupted in the interests of the State.
The ladies bandaged up their feet, got on the backs
of their attendants, and were carried home to
make it hot for the lazy huzzies who had been
smashing up the tea-things and finishing the last
pot of preserved ginger. And Parliament went
into Committee of Ways and Means.
* * *
The Chairman suggested as an immediate
relief, that those present subscribe something, and
started off with dropping a handful of spurious
coins into his hat, and handing it to an hon. mem-
ber, who dipped his hand in and exhibited the
metal to the enraged patriots. The Chairman was
Immediately seized, and sent out to be sawn up—
not for the spurious metal, for every hon. member
in the room kept nothing else when in session, not
knowing to whom they would sit next, but for
breach of privilege, in oaring to propose that they
tax themselves, when all history proves that to pay
taxes is the inalienable right of the taxpayer. It
was finally resolved that, after a full considera-
tion of the state of the country, they could see no
further way of taxing the people, and that the
Emperor had better retrench. The Emperor, who
had had his ear to the key-bole during this debate,
here had the whole Assembly arrested and ordered
to the saw-mill, with instructions to send the
clothes and pigtails around to the nearest pawn-
shop, and with the proceeds order in two tons of
rice and a leg of ham. “ For” said he, “ the times
are bad, and the King should set an example
of foresight.” Things, however, went from bad
to worse. The harvest failed, the British were
smuggling in opium, small-pox was in the land,
and piracy was rampant on the high seas.
What taxes the Governors of provinces collected
were lodged in the Oriental Bank, and that bank
was suffering from a disease, tne secondary symp-
toms of which are still apparent. More Parlia-
ments were summoned, and sent to be sawn up;
but this means of raising revenue began to tail.
All the most learned men in the Empire were gone,
and there was only one left who could check the
pawn-tickets, and the pawnbrokers themselves
would advance no more on old clothes and pig-
tails. Ki was reduced to the lowest straits. In
vain he tried to cajole the Governors ot provinces
into sending him at least a small portion of the
taxes they collected. Hemet with but one reply-
all the taxes they could collect they required tor
themselves, and he must get out of the hole the
best way he could. Everything was in pawn; and,
one evening, when Ki had dismissed the whole of
his servants, and was seated alone in his palace,
boiling his last billy of tea, and thinking of filing
his schedule, he was startled by the appearance of
a venerable man, who appeared to rise out of the
marble floor. “Who are you—mind, I don’t be-
lieve in ghosts—who are you ?” asked Ki, with his
teeth chattering, and bis pig- tail standing straight
up through his crown with terror. “ I will take a
chair, and tell you,” said his visitor, solemnly. “ I
have come to relieve the finances of China. I am
the Man with the Golden Nose.”
• ■
Kung Ki went to a cupboard and pro-
duced a quart bottle of rum and two glasses (for,
though short of rice, he was not without the
necessaries of life). When the venerable man had
emptied two glasses in succession, and unrolled
his pig-tail, and stretched out his feet to the fire,
the Emperor said, “ On with your anecdote, my
son; for gilt I want, and gilt I must have, or up
King-street I go with the morning sun.” “ I was
born,” began the old man. “Never mind that,”
roared the Emperor; “I know where you’ll die, if
you know how to raise money and don’t; so mark
me, now. How am I to pay my debts, and carry
on the Government?” “Pay through the nose,”
answered the oracle, laying his fingers alongside
that organ. “ Damn it,’’ shrieked His Majesty,
leaping into the air and hanging there by his own
Sg-tail; “I have done that already.” “If your
ajesty will glide down and listen. I will tell you,
I am a priest in the Temple of Fo, and am two
thousand years old.” “When i« your next birth-
day ?” gasped the Emperor. “ I have studied the
mysteries, and have at last discovered the secret
long sought in Europe—the philosopher’s stone.
It turns the human nose to gold. I say you must
pay through the nose.” “ Whose nose ?” asked
the Emperor. “ Mine,” replied the stranger.
“ Bring your tallow dip a bit nearer, and
tell me what you think of this organ.” He obeyed,
and said he saw nothing but the ordinary Roman
nose, which at that time distinguished the Chinese
race. The stranger then, with a few mystic words
to Buddha, produced a small stone, lightly rubbed
it over the bridge of his nose, and beho'd a
wonder. Ki could scarcely believe his eyes The
nose was a mass of pure gold. “I think I’ve
struck nuggety ground,” said Kl, going to the
cupboard for a hammer and cold chisel. “ Hold
your head steady, my son, and close your eyes and
mouth, while I try a prospect.” He chipped off a
piece, and after examining it, pronounced it free
from galena and pyrites, and calculated to go a
thousand ourcss to the ton. “Takea drop more
of something,” urged the jubilant monarch, filling
himself a bumper, “and discourse ou the best
means of working 1 this claim, oh, thou saviour of
thy country. But one nose will never suffice.”
'Observe,” returned the sage, “I rub my nose
with this negative stone, an'* it’s as you were.”
“I grasp you,” said the excited Er-neror, “you
propose to remain here and rub your nose as often
as I shall require it. Good. What, ho, within
there! Let the foundry men turn out in force,
and let the trusty file and cold chisel and hammer
re-echo day and night through my ancestral halls!
Gramercy, but I will pav through the nose with
a vengeance.” “Not a your Majesty,” said
the man of mysteries; i .1 < ot propose that you
shall adopt any hand-t >-iu<iu h policy.” “Nor I,”
was the eager reply of the Emperor, nudging his
visitor in the ribs; “from hand-to-nose is my dart,
old boy, see ? Ha, ha!” and His Majesty fell con-
vulsed on the floor, and kicked up his heels, and
jaughed till the horn panes rattled again. “ China
is saved,” he cried, “and King-street may goto
the devil.”

“Wc must proceed,” continued the old
man, “ by count of noses. Rash proceedings have
been the ruin of princes. What you require is, not
that one, but all of your subjects shall wear the
golden badge. This stone is capable of infinite
subdivision. Let a portion be distributed to each
Governor of a province, with sealed instructions
that it be subdivided and re-distributed to every
magistrate, priest, and reliable constable in every
city and village in the Empire On a day to be
fixed by general proclamation, when a tele-
gram shall issue from this Court at mid-day,
let every man, woman, and child (omitting only
C.M.G.e, who cannot be trusted) be supplied with
a small portion, and Instructed to be in readiness
when the word shall be flashed through the coun-
try. Let it also be arranged that in each centre
there shall be [an ample supply of small rapidly-
revolving grindstones under the control of reliable
officers. Assemble the court, and pass through the
crowd in silence. At five minutes to twelve, rise
from the throne, and command that every man in
China produce the mystic stone. The wires come
in from all parts— 1 We are ready.’ At one minute
to twelve, rub your nose with this stone, and let
the proclamation be flashed abroad that ‘the
golden dawn of prosperity shines on the face of
the Son of the Sun, and that all men rub theirs in
sympathy.’ ” Having said these words,and helped
himself to another drop of Jamaica, the venerable
man rose, am saying “Bless you, my son—be
happy,” sank silently through the floor and out of

The scene that followed, were it not
vouched for by contemporary MSS. recently dis-
covered by the late Mr. Sapphyra Sohapira, would
read more like romance than authentic history
For the first time on the earth, a nation was seen
atnoonday-a nation of two hundred millions of
people—standing staring at each other in silence
Impudence, cunning, ferocity, even brazenness*
disappeared from every countenance, and there
was nought on the human face divine but one
blank universal stare, lighted up by a golden Sucv
lamp in the centre. Then they knew that Ki was a
god. “To the grindstone!” shouted the office™
from one 1 end of the Empire to the other- and
through court and alley, in market place and in
Joss-house, in the gaols and on the sandy desert
nothing was to be heard till sunset but the swish
of the grindstone, as taxpayer after taxpayer came
up to the stone, placed his nose in position, and
praised god as he saw the precious dust dx-ibble
down into the sealed boxes prepared to receive
His Majesty’s just dues. For days and weeks the
waggons came pouring into the palace-yard, tip-
ping out tons and tons of the precious dust.
Ki was fairly in ecstacies, and at last delightedly
beheld bin self possessed of the sinews of war.
He called for half a million troops to drive the
French out of Tonquin; but here a difficulty came
In the wav. By the ancient laws of the land, and
the precepts of religion, no man could enter the
public service who was mutilated. And there was
not a man In China, except the Emperor, who had
a nose left. He was paralysed. His proclamation
for once had been too well obeyed. Turn where
he would, he met nothing but fiat faces, and
streaming eyes weeping for their noses, because
they were not. The common people had no noses
to blow, the insolent none to pull, the boys none t®
punch, and the detectives were unable to smell a
rat. The Mandarins got no respect, and stayed at
home weeping and looking in the glass, and re-
ported to the world that China was bewitched. The
thing became intolerable. Ki, with all his wealth,
had no servant, and was compelled to go out and
purchase his morning chop and cook it in solitude
In the palace. He now saw his gigantic mistake.
He had taken the philosopher’s stone, but had for-
gotten its negative, which would have restored
every nose in the kingdom. He offered sacrifices
to Buddha, and implored him to send again the
mystic visitor. Scarcely had the smoke ascended
from the altar, than the figure was before him.
• • •
“You forgot something,” began the Em-
peror. “You refer, of course, to the other stone,”
remarked the visitor. “Persuade your people
that they are not mutilated. It is always eaay for
a M Emperor to lead his people by the nose.”
“Mock me not,’’.roared the royal madman, “you
know there is not a nose to get hold of.” “ Then
take this stone, and summon the people again.”
It was done, livery nose in the kingdom was par-
tially restored, as we may see by th°ir descendants,
the gods having left them sunken In the middle, as
a memento of the day of Fan Shi, or the “scoop-
ing out” of Grindstone Day, but all the gold dis-
appeared at the same moment. Then Ki seized a
hatchet to slay his visitor. It went through and
through him, but there he sat unmoved, the Man
of the Golden Nose, smiling. “ When you have
done,” ha said, “ I will take my leave.” The coun-
tenance suddenly turned to brass, a horn shot out


“ He’s married and settled,” said Brown to
Jones, the other day, speaking 1 of their mutual
acquaintance, Smith; “and what is mere, he s
comfortably settled,” continued Brown. This was
rather an astonishing statement, for competent
iudges had for years considered Smith past all
hopes of reformation, and about the last man to
be led into the meshes of conjugal blessedness; for
he was a gentleman who sacrificed punctually and
considerably at the altar of Bacchus, and gene-
rally smoked the pipe of peace, or rather of dis-
cord, in the smaller hours of the morning, fre-
quently finishing his nocturnal adventures about
the hour the milk came round. Comfortably
settled,” reiterated Brown, “for I had my un-
worthy legs under his hospitable mahogany only
l-ast Sunday. He’s got a nice little place out
Petersham way, and talks about standing for
Town Councillor, or M L A., or something of that
sort.” “But who gave him credit far the furni-
ture and that kind of thinv,” enquired Jones, for
Smith was an individual notoriously in debt, and
whoso credit was at a very low ebb. Oh, said
Brown, “ he’s given up all that, and, influenced no
doubt by his better-half that is, he saved up his
money, and went down to Anthony Hordern s
place and paid cash down for everything.” When
people begin to see the wisdom of those magio
words, “Cash down,” we always think they are on
the right road." 1
The Governor of Queensland visited Bun-
daberg the other day. Ho was given a grand re-
ception, but there was no band. The band had
struck. It seems that, for several years past, these
ingenuous instrumentalists have been pressed Into
the service of every show that was started in the
town. If a tea-fight were on the board, the band
loved to play while the dearly beloved garrotted
the muffins ; if a religious raffle was in swing, the
band was expected to stir up the spirits of the
public to the requisite pitch of desperation. The
result was, of course, that ab who drew blanks
developed an Instantaneous desire to burst in the
big drum. At last, the band grew so cheap
that it was called out to discourse devotional
music at every do« - fight and rat - worry
that occurred in the township. Naturally,
the members grew weary of this popularity ;
and so, when the Governor was expected to
visit the town, they refused to play, unless they
were paid half-a-sovereign each for their services.
The Council refused to sanction this reckless ex-
penditure. And so, when His Excellency came,
they had to hire a man to whistle the National
\nthem on his fingers. One of the alderme -
offered to ’ccompany him on a tooth-comb. , 1T1

K1 here awoke, aud found that he was still
seated on his throne, and after th© exhaustion of
reading the speech had dropped off for a five
minutes’ nod, which his courtiers dared not dis-
turb. Readers may draw their own lessons from
this history, but none of them will dispute that
the present price of meat is unconscionable.
He was a bush missionary, and, strange to
sav, his name was not Peter Campbell. One Sun-
day, during the present month, ho reined up at the
door of a well-to-do selector’s cottage, on the
Bland River, about 1 p m., and immediately
rounded up every soul on the place Into the back
parlour, and was proceeding to wade Into Faul to
the Ephesians when the good woman of the house
beckoned him out, and begged to be excused, as
she was busy frying an Immense panful of h°me-
cured bacon and home-made sausages for the
dinner, and was afraid to leave the pan. But the
zealous missionary was eager to have her soul,
and, catching her by the hand replied, Come in,
come in, my dear Mrs —- th Looard will pro-
vide. and if y’ jest leave the pan on th fire, and
the kitchen-door open, I’ll draw to a close when I
hear the bacon frizzling.”
In describing the amusements of the people
Mr. Walter Besant declares that the working-man
cannot play at any game at all, neither cricket nor
foot-hall; nor does he run, leap, or practice
athletics of any kind; he cannot swim; he can-
not dance. This is the crass one-sided view of the
smug middle-class man. It may be true as regards
the English working-man, but, even if true, it is a
shabby idea to use it as a reproach against him. In
England, the artizan classes are mostly congregated
in the cities, where opportunities f; ir engaging in
games or exercises are not available to them.
And from their youth-from the time they are old
enough to he apprenticed or set to work—they
have all available energy thoroughly pumped put
of them by hard labour, and are not likely to feel
much disposed to re-commence Physical exert! °“x
even if they got the chance. That a lack or
dexterity at'games is not due to structural 0 r
intellectual deficiency In the working-man, is
sufficiently proved by the experience of this
colony, where working-men h a yeas a clasamore
leisure and easier lives. Here, in Sydney alone,
the aquatic clubs regard it necessary to d ebar
mechanics from competing in amateur matones,
because they sweep off all the when they are
ndmittod on even terms. And it was the mecnanio
class which gave our first international cricketing
eleven the two Bannermars. And has produced
nearly all the athletic record-makers and breakers
in the world.
In Melbourne, the “obituary” poet has
added a new terror to death Hear him. In
Memory of the Late Charles B rown. Bcmtmaker,
Moray street, South Melbourne, Died March 16,
1884:—
“ Father of all who reigns s uP£eme
We mourn for our dear friend, Brown,
Thou took from us in thy own wise way
To heaven above to wear his crown.
His age while here was twenty-eignt.
Ho was a father, and to me a friend,
God bless his children and the widow. f>
So that they will meet him at the end.
Our own canary answereth
Hear me, Great Jove, whose red right hand
Bringeth thy lightning mallet down:
Crush to the dust, with su phurous brand.
The wretch who wrote the dirge on Brown.
Heed that ho grow not old in crime,
To mock the memory of a friend,
To wound the weak with heartless rhyme,—
Let black perdition be bis end;
And, that both soul and body die,
Starve thou the dull editor with about a ton
and a-half of his own “ pie.”
“ The pension of the Marlborough family
has been commuted by the payment of £107,01X1.
Thus a late cablegram. The original granting of
the meant-to-be perpetual pension was a swindle ,
the payment of each successive year s amount
was an infamy; and now the commutation, ter-
minating though it does the scandalous t ransaction,
is a more disgraceful swindle and a deeper infamy
atm. Repudiation of the contract, on the ground
of Its inherent immorality and Inconsistency with
healthy Liberalism, would have been the proper
step,
For, say could e’en a prostrate tribune’s power,
Or a mock senate in Rome’s servile hour,
Insult so much the claims, the rights of man,
As doth the fettered mob, the free divan
Of “ noble ” tools and “ honorable ” knaves,
Of pensioned patriots and privileged slaves!
Just fancy a professedly Liberal, semi-Radical
Government consenting to the commutation of an
inherently disgraceful pension what time the wild
wail of outcast London and pauper Britain was
echoing in their ears. When such attention is paid
to the vested interests of greed and selfishness by
the powers that be, what wonder that want and
misery and dread of sheer starvation plot what
insolent authority calls treason and violence, but
which, after all, is Hker justice than Bight Honor-
able Tlte Barnacelism will condescend to admit.
“ When an English Prime Minister (re-
marks the Melbourne Age) recommends for
knighthood, he may fairly be supposed to do It
from something like personal knowledge, and in
recognition of ostensible services to the State.
When the same man recommends a list of colonists,
it is generally understood that he does it by the
advice of the colonial Governors of the day, and
he is tolerably certain to act with regard to English
rather than to colonial interests. Now and again,
of course, as man after man suoeeds In taking or
keeping high office among us, the choice of Down*
log-street will fall upon some man whom his
fellow-countrymen would have honoured. Even
so, the honour loses half its value when it comes
in a haphazard fashion, and is either tardy or
premature. Therefore, even if it were desirable
that titular distinctions should be naturalised
among us. many of m would be inclined to think,
with Mr. Francis, that they ought to come directly
from the community. It is more than question-
able, however, whether titles are not out of date
and out of place in modern society. That here-
ditary titles are bad almost all are agreed. Of
those that die with the wearer it may be surely
paid that there is no accurate way of dispensing
them, that they interfere with social equality.
that they minister to a diseased vanity, and that,
like hereditary honours, they furnish a Minister
with a very potent engine of corruption. There
are probably still a good many English politicians
who look forward to a seat in the House of Lords
as the reward of long service. We cannot remem-
ber any important instance of one who has taken
a knighthood of any kind, except as a law officer
of the Crown; and what even second-rate English
statesmen despise ought not, one would tblrik, to
be an object of ambition, to the best Victorians.
This is true down to the ground. If one could
only persuade Australian politicians who are
hankering after titular distinction, that, knight-
hood was beneath their deserts, a great point would
be gained, since, as no British premier would ever
think of advising the Crown to confer a peerage
on a colonial, there would be a chance of the
ridiculous practice of “interfering with social
equality ’’ falling into desuetude.
Starkey's AErated Cordial Works, Philip-
street, Sydney.
Wb give in this issue a sketch of Starkey s mrated
cordial works, Philllp-street, in this city—one
of the most extensive factories of the kind in
Australia. And, if these works have been pro-
minent for their extent, they have certainly not
been surpassed for unvarying excsllenc of,manu-
facture. The name of Starkey has been identified
for over a quarter of a century with the very nest
description of cordials—in fact, with that name is
associated the record in this colony of the intro-
duction of most of the novelties or Inventions
in this Important line of trade. The business was
established thirty years ago by Mr. John Starkey,
different premises being used during that period as
the requirements of trade demanded. In Castle-
reagh-street. Mr. Starkey had very extensive
works specially built for the purposes of a factory,
but. during the last few years, even those became
inadequate, and premises in I hillip-street
had to be secured. Then, when these were
found inadequate, the commodious site now
Illustrated was taken, and new works erected.
These are certainly the best designed and most
commodious in the colonies, and in every part
b-ar the stamp of great strength and permanency.
They have been specially built from Mr. Starkey s
own designs, and nothing but a thoroughly practi-
cal experience of what was required could have so
well worked out the plan. On one portico of the
ground stands a first-class residence, which, while
being pntiroly separate from the works, is
so connected at the southern end as to allow
of entry to the main gallery of the factory,
from whence a view can be obtained or
the operations la every branch. The entrance
to the factory is through a spacious arenway,
which opens into a wide, expanding court-yard,
asphalted throughout, with stone guttering and
other similar conveniences, the natural fall giving
means for first-class drainage. To the left, on
entering, are the offices, and at the rear rises a
three-storey stoutly-built store, with patent hoists,
&c., for receipt and removal of goods. The base-
ment is clear, as the first floor rests on stout stone
pillars, and the upper floors are used for storage
purposes, and likewise for the private cordial
laboratories, whence supplies are obtained lor toe
various descriptions of cordials manufactured
below. There is here an extensive first-class cor-
dial bin, kept separate from the other branches,
and here, likewise, supplies are obtained, as re-
quired for the trade. Overhead are the boiling
and svrup floors, where there are all the latest ap-
pliances, and It is so arranged that the
workmen below obtain their supplies without
ever once entering the department. Off this
store there extends a spacious gallery sup-
ported on strong pillars, the gallery having a
depth of about 35 feet, and a length of not less
than about 180 feet. It Is used in the upper floor
for a variety of manufacturing purposes, as wen
as for the storage of bottles, casks, and other
goods. The space below forms an extensive
covered factory, where there is an eternally
busy scene, upwards of fifty hands being engage a
In one capacity or another. At the Northern end
is to be found a splendid 10-h p. gas-engine, the
latest patent, the prettiest bit of mechanism tnat
can probably be found in Sydney. This engine
gives power to all parts of the works, and oper
ates as required in the filling, bottling, and wasn.
ing departments. There are twelve washing or
cleaning appliances, and a large number of Oodd s
and -ther patent fillers. There are five large
cylinders for the aerated waters, these being
supplied from overhead, without reference
in any way to the workmen below. The style in
which the arrangements for work are here found
in operation at once proves that, fpr cleanliness
and quality of material, no similar factory in these
colonies can be found to surpass it. At the
southern end of this extensive department, the
floor is raised three feet, and from here all the
vehicles are expeditiously loaded, operations
proceeding in all weathers without the slightest
cessation. And as in other respects Mr. Starkey
has adopted a liberal plan, so. In respect of the
stabling accommodation for his horses, does his
establishment do him great Credit. The stabling
here is as good as is to be found anywhere in
Sydney Fine wide boxes run from end to end of
the stabling, the front being entirely open, the
hay and chaff-cutting loft overhead being sup-
ported bvBtoutetone pillars nearly two feet thick
; All this stabling is commanded by water jets, and
the fall is such as to secure effective drainage.
There is every convenience in this respect, in
fact, to the smallest detail, the greatest considera-
tion appears to have been given : so that, tnemoie
minute the inspection of a visitor, the more
thorough the Tsatiafac.i n. It is almost unneces-
sary, in conclusion, to refer to the fact that Mr.
Starkey has won the highest prizes in all the
colonial exhibitions. In closing this sketch we
desire to call attention to the life-like portrait of
Mr. Starkey, which appears in a corner of the
illustration. That is the likeness of the man
who has bui't up a mammoth business in
Auslra'ia, and whose enterprise and industry have
made his name as extensive in its familiarity
as the aerated waters that spring ifrora hie
establishment.

The Grafton Rowing Club regatta has
been postponed till 28th June.
It is stated that it will he fully a month
before “Professor” Miller will be able to put his
foot to the ground. _ ,
The three New South Wales representa-
tives made nearly half the runs scored in the
Marylebone match.
Cassimer defeated Johns in a foot-race, 125
yards, at Mudgee, on the 24th. The stakes were
stated to be £100 a side.
h On Queen’s Birthday, a 150-yards’ handi-
cap. run at Bourke, resulted in a win for Budd,
Rogers second, and Arnold third.
The footballers are footing it merrily in
Melbourne. During a match between Carlton and
South Melbourne, Gates had his jaw broken, and
J. Resser sprained his ankle badly.
Donnelly and Sullivan have just planked
up a 14-ft. “canvasser” for Mr. M’Conville, and, so
far as can be judged in the shed, she promises to
make sad havoc amongst the other small fry next
season.
At the Steeplechase meeting of the Melton
Mowbray Race Club, in Tasmania, Princella won
the Maiden Steeplechase ; Denmark the Handicap;
Princella the Handicap Hurdle ; Granvll e the
Handicap Flat Race ; and Bottler was successf ul
in the Hack Race.
The opening football match at Albury,
between married and single, resulted in a drub-
bing for the benedicts. One of the latter said he
did not mind losing the match. It was looking
forward to the lively billet of telling the wife that
completely broke him down.
Sir Thomas Elder’s sale of blood stock at
Adelaide, brought £8133, 40 horses being the num-
ber disposed of. Guesswork was sold to Mr.
Matthew Bryant, of Victoria, for £1100; Con-
jecture to the same buyer for £1000 ; King of the
Gipsies to Mr. Inglis for £825 ; Bassanio to Mr.
Weekes for £350 ; and Baron Mueller to Mr. Leeke
for £225.
Eleven bicyclists made a start for the 25-
mile amateur bicycle race for a ten-guinea trophy,
in connection with the Melbourne (Vic.) Bicycle
Club. The finish between the first three men was
very close. J. Foulkes (5mln. 15sec ) won in Ih.
27min. 25sec.; H. Sheckelford (Imin. 26sec.), fifteen
yards away, second; and H. C. Bagot (5min. 5scc.),
third, twenty yards behind Sheckelford.
The Melbourne Hunt Club had fine weather
and a small attendance for their Birthday meeting
at Flemington on Saturday last. Llddington wen
the Selling Race, Pailleroo carried off the Corin-
thian Flat Race. Cupola won the Flying Stakes,
Blackthorn made an easy win of the Open Steeple-
chase, Impulse won the Bonni Selling Stakes, and
Pailleroo made a second win in the Birthday
Stakes.
Raynor, the long-distance walker, has been
worrying the sawdust at Albury. The Mechanics’
committee would not grant the use of the hall, so
he walked in the open air, 50 miles in the stated
time of eight hours. Thunder 1 J. Miles, in 1876,
covered 50 miles in 8h. 48min. 28sec,; and our own
Dan’l O’Leary, when in his prime, 1875, made the
record for 51 miles, 9h. 6min. 16sec. But Raynor’s
50 miles in eight hours; this is too much I
Even the weather on Saturday last could
not frighten the irrepressible footballer, and the
match at Newcastle, Wallaroos v. locals, duly
eventuated, and resulted in a win for the visitors
by 5 points to 2. The Wallaroos were made as
comfortable by their entertainers as the slushy
state of the weather would permit—one player, in
particular, receiving marked attention, in the
shape of a black eye, a very appropriate tribute
from the coaly city. The “ ladies on the Block
receive ©ur heartfelt sympathy in re the tem-
porary seclusion of one of their brightest shining
lights.
Matterson has made a good debut amongst
metropolitan scullers, and promises, when he fills
out, to make a big bid for championship honours.
He was evidently a dark horse to the Nepean han-
dicappers, and was fairly “ thrown in ” for the two
handicaps. Gulliford has forfeited to him, and
should a match be made with Bob Edwards, the
race would cause interest amongst boating men,
whether pulled on the Parramatta or the Yarra.
We cannot growl at our first flight of scullers,
take them all in all, bnt still we don t suppose men
who take an interest in aquatics will regret to see
a good man come out of such a “straight” run-
ning stable as Mick Rush’s.

George M. Robinson, who recently made
such a sorry show with Sullivan, is the champion
heavy-weight dumb-bell lifter of the world. In
1875 he gained a best on record for putting up a
50 ft. dumb-bell fifty-eight times. The same after-
noon, after completing that performance, he put
up a 100 ft. dumb-bell twenty times, lifting it from
the ground each time. He then went into practice
I to gain strength to beat the record of Pennell for
N lifting a 201)4®. bell. Finally, he thought he could
do it, and on the 4th Sept., 1876, made the attempt.
He had a 201Msft. bell cast for the purpose. A large
■ company assembled to see the attempt to beat tne
i best on record, and were astonished to see Robin-
( son jump the bell from his shoulder, hold it there
8 sec., and then lower it to his shoulder slowly.
The fourth Australian eleven have met
, with a crusher from the Marylebone eleven, who
i defeated them with an innings and 115 runs to
| spare. Cooper justified the opinion pretty gener-
ally held on this side of the Murray as to his bowl-
15 ing ability, and he must now be simply a passenger
for the remainder of the tour. It is hard to say
I how the team could have decided to play him in-
i ! stead of Boyle, who has invariably proved a good
man in all the first-class matches played at Home,
unless Boyle wanted a rest. The mistake, however,
was better made with the Marylebones, than when
| the champion matches come on. Luckily for
• Our Bovs” the gate-money rolls in, win or lose,
I - something after the style of championship races
I on the Nepean; so we need be under noapprehen-
| sion that they will be compelled to hump their
I swags just yet a bit.
The football people were knocked all of a
heap when the composition of the team to meet
the New Zealanders was first made known, and the
general opinion is that, unless some alteration is
made, the Maoris will walk rough-shod over the
Welshmen. How, in the name of thunder, such
players as H. Fligg, Graham, Shaw, and Wade were
left out, is beyond us. H Fligg is, without doubt,
one of the best quarter-backs New South Wales
can boast of, and as the final pick does not take
place till this (Thursday) evening, it is to be hoped
the selection committee will overlook every other
consideration except the playing qualities of the
men, in which case we feel no doubt that Harry
Fligg will figure in the field next Saturday. Fligg,
when playing against King’s School, got through
twice and obtained tries—no small performance
against such a well-trained and disciplined team.
The Nepean trip proved an unfortunate
venture for several of the oarsmen who competed,
and with the majority the course, or rather the
situation of it, found no more favour than it did
with the general public. By the falling in of the
boat-shed M'Clerkin had his boat, purchased only
the day before from Donnelly and Sullivan,
smashed to atoms: and by the same mishap the
boat pulled by Gulliford had her planking split in
several places. Gulliford has now forfeited to
Matterson, his backers, we hear, not thinking it
good enough to go on with the match; but a fair
criterion could not be taken from the racing on
the Nepean, as Matterson had ten pounds the best
of the handicap and pulled in the flyer built for
him by Messenger. Gulliford could not have been
in first-class trim for racing either, as the sleeping
accommodation was so very limited at Penrith, he
was compelled to share a table with Pearce and
another, which we should say was anything but a
bed of roses for men booked to race on the
morrow. Pearce, notwithstanding the table, had
plenty of blanket as the whalers would term it, he
being a couple of stone above his rowing weight.
This is what the Melbourne Sportsman
fired off about a fortnight ago:—“ We notice that
our Sydney namesake apologises for the non-
appearance of its usual sporting column by the
sudden illness of its sporting writer Wonder
where the majority of our papers would find their
pars, to clip if we came out with a similar notice.”
Nemesis was, however, on the track of the Mel-
bourne blower, and here’s what one of the papers
alluded to wrote on Thursday last:—“That most
unreliable of sporting journals, the Sportsman.
yesterday blundered in a manner which, whilst it
caused a good deal of merriment in sporting
Ilrcles, was somewhat disconcerting to backers of
orses. For example, in its report of the Melton
[owbray Malden Steeplechase, it gives Princelia
s the winner, whereas there was no such horse at
be meeting, the race having been won by Nicholas,
rith Josephine second. Again, in the Handicap
lurdle Race the Sportsman gives Princelia as the
rlnner, whereas it should nave been Nicholas,
llunders like these are inexcusable in any sporting
ournal, unless on the supposition that it obtains
ts news indirectly from other journals. Curiously
nough, the Sportsman’s account of the races on
Wednesday conforms word for word with that
lublished by the Argus on Tuesday.” When the
illnd lead the blind, &o.
“ William B. Curtis, athletic editor of the
Jew York Spirit,” says an exchange, “is probably
he best-known athlete in the world. In 1868. while
iving on Sixth Avenue, in that city, he rigged up
i frame upon which to lift heavy weights, at which
ic was unrivalled. He lifted a dead weight of
1*339 pounds, the best on record. He also lifted 3300
jounds and 3500, but the latter performances were
lone in practice, and do not form records He has
he best recorded “ hand-lift,” lifting 1330 pounds,
>r thirty pounds more than Hr. G. W. Winshlp,
ind eighty pounds more than H. Buermeyer. He
vas also a most remarkable oarsmen, and previous
;o removing to New York was a member of the
jelebrated North-western crew of Chicago. While
in Chicago, in 1874, Mr. Curtis rowed a flfty-
aaile race against time. He completed the dis-
tance in lOh. llmin. 55sec. The course was on
the Calumet river, and was one mile in length, to
be rowed up and down until the distance was com-
pleted. Mr. Curtis was president of the New York
Athletic Club for several years, but is now a mem-
ber of the American Athletic Club. He was a
member of the champion tug-of-war teams of 1877,
1879, and 1880; won the championship at throwing
the 56-pound weight in 1878; was champion ham-
mer thrower in 1876, 1875, and 1880. In 1874, with
Frank E. Yates, he won the double-scull cham-
pionship. In 1873 and 1874 he won senior single-
scull championship of the Harlem river, at the
spring regatta. In 1870,1873, and 1874, ho won the
senior single sculling championship of the North-
west at Chicago.
The irrepressible interviewer has just
turned Fred. Archer inside out, and amongst the
revelations we tlnd the “ Tinman” says : “ I would
not be surprised to see Australian horses come to
England and beat our best racers over any course,
and at any weights, for I know some excellent
mares have gone out there, especially three to Mr.
Bell, m Queensland, where, I believe, the climate
is better for breeding than In England, and I have*
also met a few Australians—notably, Mr. William
Long, who is what is known amongst English turf-
ites as being good and clever enough to hold his
own in any company.” Touching the probabilities
of a visit to Australia, Archer said : “I should
like the trip to Australia very much for a change,
not to do any riding, but merely to see what that
part of the world is like, and to witness the great
race they call the Melbourne Cup. I would not
think of riding, however, because I might be
all at sea amongst the Australian boys, who
ride their horses, from what I hear, very well,
and, perhaps, with more judgment than many
of our English louts (doubtful compliment
that): besides, the races are run from end to
end there, and require more stamina than I would
possess if I ever got to Australia. As for book-
makers, there are good and bad ones, just the
same as in everything else; but, as an instance of
honour among bookmakers in Australia, I may
mention that, some years ago, I sent to an old
acquaintance, who lived in Sydney, my tip for the
Derby, and told him he might put a bit on for me
if he liked, and if there was any book open in that,
part upon the event: and I was surprised to receive
by the mail or so after it, a draft for a nice little
plum from a Mr. E. B. Jones, who, I hear, is an
educated, and a real good fellow.” They don’t
know very much about our turfites at home as.
yet, but it is satisfactory to find that the little they
do know is to our credit.
There was as much difference in the style
of the boats pulled by the competitors in the so-
called race for the championship, as in the style of
the men in them. Hanlan pulled in a boat similar
to the wager-boats in vogue in Port Jackson many
years ago. Her midship section appears as nearly
as possible a true half-circle, and she is well carried
out till within five feet or so of the bow, when she
takes a sudden knuckle and comes home very fine.
Laycock pulled in “ The Joker,” the boat built for
him by Joe Donnelly for bis £500 race on the Clar-
ence with Rush, which he won with ease. It speaks
well for the builder that after all this time she
should have been selected by Laycock for his
match on Thursday last, and although age may
have made her a bit heavy, in our opinion she ia a
faster boat than the Yankee pulled by Hanlan—of
course, taking into consideration the fact that one
was built for a much heavier man than the other.
With regard to the men, Hanlan pulls in an en-
tirely different style to any of our Australian
scullers. His seat is fixed higher in the boat,
which gives him, when afloat, the appearance of
being a much bigger man than he really is; he
pulls with a very short stretcher, takes a good—
though not over-reach clean over his knees,
which he could not do were he lower in the boat;
gets a clean hold of the water and draws his sculls
through till his body is nearly upright, and he is
in the best position to use his strength, and then
be puts the power on. His sculls dash through
the water with a swish to be heard yards off, not
with a jerk, but with a clean draw, not finishing
the stroke till his hands are at least so far back as
a line between the hips and armpit, slightly meet-
ing his sculls, and coming forward with great
rapidity for the commencement of the next stroke.
Laycock looked rough alongside the Canadian;
and, if Hanlan pulls correctly—and of this we can-
not think there is much doubt—he, in common
with our other scullers, sits too low in his boat,
pulls with too long a stretcher—which he is com-
pelled to do. sitting so low—gets his power on at
the wrong time, and finishes before the stroke is
pulled oat, as, fitted as he is, his hands would not
clear his body were he to finish as Hanlan does.
Hanlan, being the champion oarsman of
the world, very properly received a right regal
welcome when he struck Australian soil. The
trouble now, however, is to know where w« are to
draw the public ovation line. It is probable that
we will one day be honoured by the distinguished
presence of Mr. Fred. Archer, the championJockey
of the world. Archer is to the turf what Hanlan
is to the water; therefore, we must haul him
round in a four-in-hand. Ministers of the Crown
must trot him out and slobber him over with ful-
some praise, while our bare-headed senators stand
by. and we, the free and independent citizens of
this glorious land, go down on our knees and grovel
and yell “ Long live the * Tinman’ I” Slogger Sulli-
van will also pay us a visit before he polkas along
to the Golden Shoah, and, the first time he’s sober
enough to stand up straight, he'll demand a similar
reception at our hands also, because he is to the
“ring ” what Archer is to the field and Hanlan is
to the Hood. Having started the “ ovation ” game,
we must in perfect consistency play it out to the
bitter end ; and, if we don’t, our subsequent
silence will be about as consistent as the spectacle
of one of the starving unemployed looking for
charity through the butt end of a ten-guinea
gold-mounted opera glass. And this reminds us
that new branches of sport are springing up
almost every day; and as Australia is apparently a
perfect El Dorado for champions, we will be at
last compelled to hire some other nation to assist
us in doing our conquering heroes honour. The
very latest addition to the sporting ranks, is a
gentleman who rejoices in the name of “ Micky
the Spud,” and Micky’s speciality is fighting rats*
Persona who take an interest in this innocent
recreation may be pleased to hear that a slashing
fight recently took place between Micky and an
old man rat, which was bred and trained ia a
place called Granby, Sheffield, England. Every-
thing being prepared, and a large and in-
fluential number of sporting gentleman being
assembled, a piece of string was tied round
the rat’s tail, whilst Micky allowed his hands
to be tied behind him with a rope. Everything
being being ready, time was called, and the fun
began. The man in charge of the rat (himself an
authority in the pugilistic art, it is said) placed the
animal on tha ground, retaining in his possession
the string attached to its tail. The fight then
began in earnest, and the man and the rat al-
ternately grabbed at each other. The rat drew
first “.Wood ” but fastened on the man’s face,
whilstfthe latter made grab after grab to get hold
of the rat with his teeth. The animal, however
Seized the man by his nose and inflicted a wound
which the fellow will have cause to remember.
EventuaMy the man became tired and the rat
worn OMt, During his brief, but brilliant career,
Micky has chawed up no less than 28 rats, and
fought three draws, and as we are always rather
flush of the rodents here, wo long for the happy
day when we will be able to crowd round and yell
ourselves hoarse as some of our iloquint o-ray-tors
clamber up on top of a hotel verandah, and
call for three cheers, for Mlckv the Spud, the
Champion Rat-chawer of the World.
Great were the preparations made for the
Nepean race on Thursday, the 23nd, and great were
the efforts made by the dailies to out-do each other
in keeping the metropolitans posted up in the
doings of the competitors billed to meet in the big
race for £1000 and the Championship of the World.
A couple of columns in the Rum last week quite
woke Granny out of her customary nap, and she
at once despatched the reporter who ordinarily
does the religious items to the seat of war. Upon
his arrival in the giddy little town of Penrith, the
reporter wended his wav to the boat-house and
began to interview an obliging individual who was
fixing up a racing craft. After an interview of
about an hour and a half, the reporter asked the
stranger his private opinion as to why Hanlan
refused to row on the Parramatta. “ WeR,” said
the stranger, “ I am a bit mixed up with Hanlan,
but I don’t mind telling you in confidence. Hanlan
is afraid of the sharks, and has a mortal dread of
the jelly-fish.” The reporter then departed, and
next day Granny came out with a column and
three-quarters by “ Our own Reporter,” the sharks
and jelly-fish yarn being given in all seriousness.
The “interviewed,” who was Harlan himself,
now tells the yarn, with true Yankee humour,
of the manner in which he was drawn out by
the reporter who was sent up to glean informa-
tion of the race for £1000 aside and the Champion-
ship of the World. Thursday turned out a day
made to order, but even this was insufficient to
draw a big crowd to the Nepean; and it is not
under-rating the numbers to say that barely hun-
dreds put in an appearance where thousands were
expected. That the course is a grand sheet of
water there can be no two opinions, but there can
also be no two opinions that it will never form the
champion course of Australia, judging from the
expressions of dissatisfaction on all sides during
the return trip; and the odds are that in the event
of another race on the Nepean, not ten per cent,
of last week’s visitors would turn out for such
another remarkably slow day’s sport. Boat racing,
at the best, is the poorest of sport, except to en-
thusiasts, and it is made doubly slow when four
hours train has to be put in for the sake of seeing
a 20-minutes race—or rather three or four minutes
of it, as that is the outside glimpse the grand-
stand people saw of it on Thursday. The grand-
stand was put together in a rough and ready
style; and perhaps it was as well it was not
called upon to carry more than a handful
of people, as, had there been anything like
a crush, the local sawbones would have cut in,
and Hanlan, Laycock, and the winners of the
other races, would not have been the only ones to
make anything out of the day’s venture. That the
promoters must have burnt their fingers over the
affair there can bo no doubt, and we sincerely trust
it will prove a warning to other speculators, who
make the attempt to change the champion course
of Australia from the splendid and convenient
course on the Parrramatta. The big race of the
day will allow of little description. Hanlan looked
in tip-top condition, and we looked in vain
for the haggard and stale appearance attributed
to him during his training. Used as we are to big
men for champions, he appeared a very boy along-
side his rival, no one would have cast a look
on him so far as physique was concerned. Laycock
looked well, but he could not have been in tip-top
condition, as his preparation was a deal too hurried
to allow of his coming to the post at his best. The
wheezy old launch that carried the umpire and
the press waited for the men some three-quarters
of a mile down the course, and after they passed,
she puffed away in chase seemingly making harder
work of it than Hanlan. Laycock dashed away
with the start and rowing at his top, at the quarter
had a shade of a lead, but evidently on sufferance
only, as Hanlan passed him without an effort,
and rowed over the remainder of the course
with the greatest ease, winning eventually
by a length, which he could have have lengthened
out to as many hundred had he felt so inclined.
On the Sunday preceding the race, Banian tried
the new boat put together by Edwards, of Mel-
bourne, and gave a select few a show of what he
really ean do in a wager-boat. He covered over
half a mile in 2min. 20sec., and this in a boat not
fitted up to his liking; so that, if time goes for
anything, the sculler who holds him for a mile,
when at his best, will have to clip along to rather
a lively tune. Only two boats started in each of
the local races. W. Rowe won the single sculls,
and in company with W. Sykes he also carried off
the double scull race. Matterson (25ft.) won the
handicap light skiff race, with ease, irom Gulliford
(35ft.); and he also made a win of the all-comers’
outrigger race, with a handicap of lOsec., Messenger
(6sec.) pulling into second place. Messenger had
been suffering from boils, and was far from ap-
pearing in first-class condition; but he pulled a
plucky though hopeless race to the bitter end.
Taken as a whole, the Nepean show cannot be
looked upon as anything but a huge frost, and we
fancy it will be soma time before a like venture is
entered upon again. So far as the Parramatta
course is concerned, it has gained in popularity at
the expense of the Nepean.

“Why,” asked Coleridge, Chief Justice,
when sentencing Yates for his alleged libel on
Lord Lonsdale, “should we have our lives pried
into, our movements watched, our dress recorded,
our company catalogued, our most private rela-
tions dragged into the light of day, not for any
conceivable good to the great English people, but
only to gratify the foolish vanity or the abject
curiosity of a small minority of a privileged class?’
Why ? Because (especially in the case of heredi-
tary legislators) the dress they wear, the company
they keep, the movements they execute, are keys
to their characters, in which, since they are pre-
sumed to be good enough to legislate for the
people, the people have naturally no slight interest.
Seme items which are published in society journals
about the Lords—our would-be Gods—are doubt-
less only gratifying to the vanity, and exciting to
the curiosity of very small fools; but, on the other
hand, there are scores and scores of Items that are
published about Lords, and which, themselves but
idle as thistledown and dry ai Sahara dust, yet
are not unimportant in the estimation of the wise,
inasmuch as each one of them, frivolous though
it may seem to be, helps to swell the indictment
that ultimately must crush the pretentions of a
lordly caste, and annihilate the monstrous farce of
a privileged aristocracy. Every libidinous beast
of a peer, every titled ruffian, does yeoman s ser-
vice for the good cause by realistically illustrating
the utter absurdity of conferring legislative
powers upon a scoundrel or a brute, merely be-
cause one of his ancestors happened to be a lucky
general, a royal bastard, a crafty lawyer, a schem-
ing politician, or a pimping courtier.
One of the most successful dog-shows ever
witnessed this side of the equinoctial line was held
on Monday week, in Goulburn. By the kind per-
mission of the local Police Magistrate, the capa-
cious court-house was placed at the disposal of the
exhibitors, and on the judges taking their seats it
was found tnat no less than 73 exhibits were
entered. Almost every style of dorg known to
fanciers was represented, from the huge mastiff,
with a mouth as large as a Fish River cave, or the
kisser of the sllvery-toned Georgia Minstrel tenor,
Billy Wilson, down to the tiny little terrier who
was so small that It took two men and a 40-gulnea
magnifying glass to see him. Bo pleased were the
judges with the exhibits that they treated all the
exhibitors alike : that is to say, they stuck them
in fines, and costs of court, for 14s. lOd. each. So
far as the public revenue is concerned, the show
was, therefore, a howling success in every sense of
the word, and a wish was expressed that the inde-
fatigable promoters would make it an annual
affair, and increase the number of entries. No
reply was given to this, however, except in the
case of a lady fancier, aged about 63, who emphati-
cally declared that before she’d pay any more for
her pet, she’d “git an axe an’ chop th’ sanguinary
poodle’s gory head off.” It is, indeed, a matter of
sincere congratulation to find that even in these
days of depression the poorest person in Goul-
burn can keep a “ dorg”; in fact, it ifl said that
some families are so wretchedly poor that they
can afford to keep six or seven. And. by the way,
what are our own police about that they cannot
give us a similar canine treat down here ? We
have the unregistered dorgs. All we require now
is for the foorce to find the dorgs’ owners.
It is said the Queen is firmly determined
not to sanction Colonel Valentine Baker’s re-
admission either into the army or into any society
where her Influence is recognised. We wonder
how many of those Interesting women who are so
anxious to have him back as a pet amongst them
really know the particulars that led to his exile.
We’ll refresh them with a few words verbatim
from Miss Dickenson’s evidence at his trial. She
was travelling alone in the railway carriage, and
at Liphook-station the gallant Val. got in. After
passing Woking, he asked her name, and on her
not telling it, he came and sat close to her. Then
“ I said, ‘ Get away; 1 won’t have you so near.’
and pushed him off. He said, ‘ You are cross.’ He
then put his left arm round my waist, drew me
nearer with the other hand, and kissed me once.
He said,‘You must kiss me, darling.’ I pushed
him off. I tried to ring the bell to warn the guard.
He said ’Don’t ring; don’t call the guard.’ He
then forced me back into the corner, pressed me
hack against the cushion, himself being on me,
and kissing me on the lips several times. He was
pressing heavily on me, and I could not move.
He sank down close in front of me. and I felt his
hand underneath my areas, on my stocking, above
my boot. His other hand was not touching me.
I did not see what he was doing with the other
hand, but I have an impression what he was doing.
I got up and succeeded in getting the window
down, and screamed. The defendant tried to pull
me back; 1 screamed again loudly, and turned the
handle of the door, and slipped out backwards on
to the footboard.” This was the little episode
which led the War Office to think that Colonel
Baker would no longer be an ornament to the
English Army. In Sydney the other day, a work-
ing man who had just come from the bush and
got intoxicated, placed his hand rudely on a female
in George-street. He was flogged within 48 hours.
“ Why th’ h—I don’t you look where you’re
goin’ to ? ” How ©ften have those cheerful, soul-
stirring words warmed the cold and sluggish biood
in our veins, and the frozen wax in our ears, as
we bent back In our favourite boat, and, with a
Hanlan-like swoop, sent her bow slap under the
nose of a Newcastle steamer, or clean through the
barge of a highly-indignant, hut utterly helpless
family picnic party. As a rule, these little bits of
pleasantry on our part generally caused trouble,
not only to ourselves, but also to the energetic
members of the Water Police Force, who used to
fish us up by the “ sag ” and hang us across a fence
to dry. One of the main causes of our obtrusion
on the comfort of other aquatic people was the
culpable negligence on the part ot the person who
made ua omitting to put a pair of eyes in the back
of our head to enable us to see whether we wore
making our skiff “ walk the waters like a thing of
life,” or hauling it slap up against the back pre-
mises of some of our marine-viila’d aristocracy.
All this, however, is now straightened out
by the latest improvement In boat-building,
which enables the rower to face the bow and
take stock of the scenery dead ahead of him. 1 his
invention eomes from the worksnop of Messrs.
Bpong and Co., London, and one of Its special ad-
vantages ia that all the essential points of the old
style of rowing are retained. The motion is abso-
lutely identical, the action of the oars being
reversed by the “employment of a couple of cog-
wheels. Automatic feathering is secured, nor does
this advantage entail, as might be supposed, the
disability to back water, for, by taking a shorter
stroke, the feathering water mechanism ceases to
act, or it can be stopped altogether by the removal
of a bolt.” There is nothing at all complicated or
elaborate about the new invention, which has
proved to be satisfactory in action, and highly
calculated to increase the safety and enjoyment of
tae sport without the sometime accompaniment
of such advantage—namely, the loss of power.
Our boat-builders here ought to make a note of
this lot.
Strange as it may seem, there is evidently
more than one Sims in this little world of ours,
and the sprightly author ot the “Lights o’ Lon-
don” is frequently reminded of the fact. Not
long ago, some or the home papers contained a
thrilling account of the,, doings of a certain aims,
who was charged with revelling in the mild little
amusement of jumping on his mother, and forth-
with the gentle “Dagonet” was crushed beneath
a pile ot letters from former friends who told him
plainly he was a brute, and to never again dare to
speak to them on any pretext whatever. That was
rough, but the following epistle which G.R.S. has
just received is even rougher: “Dear Sims,—
Having waited for some considerable time for an
answer to my last note, 1 must again remind you
of your promise to reaeem the piece of paper I
hold against you, within a few days. The few
days has now extended to a few months, and I
regret to say I am still in possession of the paper.
• . . . lam really rather pressed just now, and
I should feel extremely obliged ii you would
make an effort to let me have the whole or half
this week. I trust the bad foot is all right now,
and that you can get out.” That neat reminder
came from a box-keeper of a theatre in the North
of London, and, as the popular writer never owned
a bad foot in his life, and is generally believed to be
roiling ia riches, it is evident that he ia not exactly
the “ Dear Sims ” that’s wanted. Talking of this
reminds us that Wilson Barrett, the lessee of the
Princess’S Theatre. London, whilst orating at a
redent banquet, pleasantly referred to the time
when he—flattering himself upon the grand recep-
tion he had met with in Dublin —“was brought
down from the pinnacle on which he had placed
himself by the assurance that the audiences had
applauded him imagining him to be related to the
Barrett who had recently been hangedifor his share
in the Fenian explosion at Glerkenwell.” The
man who said there’s nothing ia a name was a
most egregious ass.
Constable Bennett has been “houldin’ his
head too high ” to suit the taste of the Reedy
Creekers (Vic.); at least, so the bucolic xesiden a
of that rural hamlet say. But, on the other hano,
the “guardian of the pace” asserts that “he just
holds his head high enough to maintain the repu-
tation of a constable”—whatever altitude that
may be. However, it can’t be very exalted, if we
may judge by the evidence adduced in meKilmore
Court last week, when Edward M’Manus and
Gregory G. Anderson were charged with having
used abusive language to Constable Bennett. It
appears that one evening of late the policeman
was “ in want of information and in search of
merriment,” so he dropped into the Commercial
Hotel, where a young lady was pounding out
selections from the opera of “ The night before
Larry was stretched,” on a grand piano, and quite
a number of youths and maidens of the Creek
were holding a musical festival. Amongst the
giddy throng were the two young men already
alluded to. Anderson was a vocalist of good local
repute, and on being asked to warble, refused
point-blank, on the plea that the audience was
getting mixed, and lightly referred to the presence
of the constable by remarking, in a loud tone of
voice, “I don’t sing before such low company as
this. I don’t sing before a snake-headed like
this.” And then the constable took the hint and
left the scene of revelry, but as be was going down
the street the two young men followed and
broadly accused him of giddy proceedings in con-
nection with a young lady to whom the amorous
constable had been paying his addresses, and who,
It appears, “loved,not wisely, but too well.” Undt r
cross-examination at the Kilmore Court, Bennett
“ maintained the reputation of a constable ” right
through, especially in the style in which he tried
to evade the authorship of a letter which he had
sent to his “ Dear Nelly,” and the profound ignor-
ance, natural or assumed, that he displayed in
court. Anderson was fined 10s. for insulting
language, but it is possible that the conduct of the
policeman will form the subject of an investiga-
tion ere long.
Talk about the Wars of the Roses, the
rouseabout days of the Commune, and Bull’s Run,
why they’re never in it when you turn to the civil
war that *s now raging in a sprightly little town
out West. It appears that some time ago the
bong-tong membahs of the place in question, held
a private meeting in the churchyard at midnight,
and decided to form a Winter Quadrille Assembly
Club for the aristocracy of the district only, and it
was unanimously decided that no tradesman or
store people, or “ any othah dem’d, low, working
fellahs ” were t© be admitted under any pretext
whatevah. In order to make doubly sure that this
aesthetic society would not be contaminated by
the presence of any of those howid low-form per-
sons who work for their living, the entrance fee
was fixed at a guinea, and the list of persons in-
vited was kept as secret as the State correspond-
ence of the old tow-headed Doges of Venice. After
a time, this silver-tall club was duly formed, and
the hours were chased with many-twinkling feet,
and then the dreaded day came when the treasurer
found it necessary to scoot round and chase the
guineas also. Then the club became more select
than even its most enthusiastic membahs cared
to see; and now, to ioap the trouble, the vul-
gah portion of the community have formed
an opposition society called the Mercantiles, which
is started, as the advertisements state, for “ gentle-
men—other than bank officials.” Half a hundred
of the most respectable and influential men in
the district have already joined, ana so great has
the success of the new venture been, that one half
of the aristocratic beggars opposite, are kicking
themselves for being such lunatics as to have ever
done anything to help to throw a slur on honest
labour. Where the sting comes sharpest, however,
lies in the fact that the ladles connected with the
Mercantiles can dance the crinolette p oufes off the
aesthetic damozols connected with the opposition;
and so, when the lively strains of the Mercantile s
“ First Set ” fill the frosty air, the culchawed crowd
stuff wool in their ears, and pull the blankets over
tneir <Rminished heads, and assign those dem’d
fellahs to various sultry places in the dim and un-
certain future. Of course it was a “ Mercantiler ”
told us this, and now we wait in breathless sus-
pense to hear trom the shirt-collared mashers who
* kick with the other leg.”
The reporter, concerning whose wrangle
with John Brown a one-sided and garbled account
from John Brown’s point of view is given by the
Queen in her last book, was Mr. Donald M’Naugh-
ton, who, at the time, represented the Times. Mr.
M'Naughton has now published his account of the#
affair. Mr. M’Naughton was in company witii
Messrs. Allan, of the Glasgow Herald: M’Aus-
lane, North British Daily Mail; Gilbert, of tie
Edinburgh Scotsman, and Colin Livingston, head
master, National School, Fort William. He writes:
—“ At this time of day 1 presume I may be alio wed
to tell the story myself. John Brown was not
more civil to us correspondents than he was to the
rest of Her Majesty’s servants and loyal subjects;
if anything, he was less so, bullying wher begot
the chance. Evidently he knew he had tae Queen
to back him in any case, and acted accordingly.
When I saw him on his way up from the Royal party,
making towards me, I was fully half a mne off,
but I guessed he was ill-pleased at some of us, and
I waited to see the fun. 1 was in no way afraid of
him, though I was alone, and he double my
weight; for I knew that his stiff, almost perpend -
cular, climb would take fighting inclination out of
a far more sinewy man tnan him. f never
budged. Soon he stood before me raging. *You
move away out of therel’ was his first salutation.
’ Who (he are you ? I have as much right to
be here as you have,’ I said. He stood still for a
while, as if resolving what to do next, while I
went on with my werk. ‘ Wull you be ceevll
eneuoh to more out of there ? ’ in a more pacified
tone. * Not on your orders, but If the Queen com-
mands me, I fly.’ Another moment’s reflection,
and he said, * Yea ; it’s ta Queen’s commands.’ I
gathered up my things at once, and moved along-
side of the mountain, John walking close to my
right. I endeavoured to open up a conversation
by remarking, ‘ What a splendid day to be out! ’
‘You had a spying glass, looking at the Queen,’
Ignoring what I said. ‘ I have, but I know how to
use it better than that.’ * By the bye,’ I said after
walking another twenty yards without speaking, i
‘you know, I suppose, a countryman of mine,’
mentioning the name—* a piper in the Royal house-
hold?’ This drew him out. Ho glared at me for
some time, and then, throwing in all the dignity
and scorn at his command, answered, ‘Me! what
do I know about pipers?’ Thisriled meupabit,
and, as the other correspondents were pouring In
from all quarters, I felt stronger, so I faced him
with, ‘ Mr. Brown, I have nothing further to say
to one of your sort; you can go now.' We both
stood still, he eyeing me savagely. 4 Well, a’m—,
but I’ll fight i on.’ * I have no time to spare just
now for pleasure, but meet me in Fort W illiam at
a quarter-past five to-night, and we’ll see about
it,’ I replied. ‘Well, a'm —, but I wull;’ and
with that we parted, I to divulge the great Court
secrets to my companions, with which they sus-
pected John of supplying me, and he to join the
Royal party. When we parted it was five o’clock.
Fort William was over twenty miles away, thus
leaving us only fifteen minutes to do that distance.
Were we Glencoe eagles we could not keep our
appointment, and perhaps neither of us was sorry
for it. John, so eager for the fray, did not seem
to think much about the time till, when half-way
down, something seemed to strike him about the
arrangement. We saw him stop suddenly, take
out his watch, turn ia my airection, and shake his
list at me threateningly. He evidently saw the
trap he was led into. The next time I saw him he
was too busy lecturing Dr. C of K , on
board the steamer which took the Royal party to
Inverness, to notice me. We were always about
half a mile at least out of the way.”

Once again, oh, say it sweetly,
Once again.
We have twirled with maidens featiy
At Balmain.
We again a little verse on
Paper put,
Chant a charming' little person
Dainty-Foot.
It was at Balmain we met her.
In the crush,
With a smile, and, what is better,
With a blush.
Little figure, satin bodiced,
And her eyes—
Well, you never sa»v such modest
Scraps of skies.
Still upon our hand there lingers,
Lingers yet,
Touch that we-oh I magic fingers—
Can’t forget.
Any man is apt to soften
Thus, you say ?
Yes; but we alas! so often
Get this way.
There have been few pleasanter dances held in the
Balmain School of Arts than the second assembly
Ball, last Friday, despite the weather. The ram
descended and the winds blew most violently, but
Balmain is founded on a rock, and the worst result
of the weather was some delay caused by the
difficulty in getting cabs. Dancing started about
9 o’clock, to the fine music of Shapter s band, and
the floor was in excellent condition. Between a)
and 80 people present allowed ample space for all,
and as the storm raged without, it was cheering to
see, not only the seats filled all round the hall, but
a gallery-full of spectators who found interest in
the scene until after midnight. Great pains ban
been taken to make the hall ornamental; round
the walls and doorways and across the ceiling was
a lavish display of flags, which were not only gay
but clean. This is so phenomenal a fact in connec-
tion with ball-room bunting than it ought to be
recorded. The platform was carpeted and arranged
with seats, and in the spacious supper-room every-
thing was well provided by Mr. and Mrs. Holden
A sensibly assorted programme contained twenty-
four dances, but, as it was determined to keep the
music going till about 5 o’clock, so that city visi-
tors could catch the first morning boat, a number
of “extras” were added. Of course, the ladies
who honoured the occasion demand a notice,
especially as some of their toilettes were very
pretty. With a married lady from Duke-street, in
a quiet dove-coloured satin, came her sister, a tall
and handsome blonde girt, whose enthusiastic
fondness for dancing detracted not one whit from
Its gracefulness. Her dress was in keeping —
garnet or ruby velvet bodice, and plain satin skirt
of similar colour with one flounce halt its length,
both flounce, hem, and bodice edged with flue
white lace. With the party ;vas a Melbourne lady,
whose dress was a very s ylishly-made black bre-
cade, with folds of white lace held at the waist by
a rose, and who was also an excellent dancer. One
of the treats of the evening was an extra, playea
by Miss Burning, a long dreamy waltz, in
■which many tunes were dovetailed into one
another with admirable skill and expression. A
little blonde, with hair piled up, wore a nice
black satin top, and blue satin skirt vandyked over
a black kilted hem. A Darling-street visitor wore
white madras muslin and roses ; another, whose
airy skirts appeared to be supported by some un-
seen but fashionable agency, wore palest straw
material with an almost limitless number of tucks;
and the dress of a local lady, of cream broche, &c.,
and flowers, was, like herself, as charming as po;-
sible. A smiling: little maiden of Mullens-street
was all in black and pink roses; and a Beattie-
street resident had dotted her black satin with bits
of blue ribbon, in a way which suggested the idea
that she had been simultaneously attacked by a
dozen of Mr. R. T. Booth’s “ workers.” A tasteful
dress was worn by a flowery-named young lady
from town—ruby plush bodice with ridged
Shoulders and ruff neck, and a pink veiling skin
In three flounces headed with cross bands. Two
city sisters, one in blue satin, the other in a pretty
straw-coloured and cardinal satin, were exquisite
dancers. From Castlereagb-street was a fair lady
all in black, which quiet colour was also adopted
In velvet by the sister of the hon. treasurer A
dress combining electric blue satin with white
skirt was choice. Pink plush and satin suited a
pleased little maiden of the great boating suburb,
whose cousin from Sing'eton looked as fascinating
as any girl could desire to, at her first bail, in
crushed strawberry ottoman and cream skirt of
nun’s veiling. A pretty Surry Hills visitor wore a
nice ball dress, the bodice of lavender satin, and
cream skirt in many small flounces up to the waist.
As the night was a long one, adjournments to the
tables, where Mrs. Holden so deftly and civilly dis-
pensed her good things, were frequently neces-
sary, and it must have been daylight before some
of the dancers got home. The ball was organised
by a committee who deserve every credit for the
way it was carried through; and a large part of its
success was certainly due to Mr. J. J. Gates for his
efforts during the evening to make everyone feel
at home. 9 m m
The Royston College boys, whose sports
were postponed from Wednesday to Friday on
account of wet, had a fine gathering, although the
sun did not patronise them much. They had a
gaudy pink programme containing 20 races, and a
liberal prize list. Entries were unusually numer-
ous, four of the races having over 30 each; and
among the racing colours such distinctions as
“ skull and crossbones ” and “ brickdust and
crushed lemon ” were decidedly novel. Music was
provided by the Naval Brigade Band. The stand
enclosure —where, on such occasions, both sexes,
well-appointed, take the field”—was comfortably
full. Close against the «hite palings crowded the
enthusiastic male friends of the young collegians,
who cheered as each individual struggle was made;
and up in tne stand sat their proud parents and
patrons, content to express their satisfaction in a
less exuberant way. Tne chilly air kept the lawn
fail of promenaders, and there it was, garbed in
the latest allurements of fashion, were seen the
Bisters, cousins, and aunts in all their glory. Some
wretched cynic has said that when a woman is
perfectly well dressed, she : experiences a peace of
mind such as no religion can give. Of course, we
cannot be expected to endorse such an objection-
able statement; but, supposing it to be distantly
possible that the horrid man had the least atom of
truth in him, then some of the ladies must have
had their minds in a peaceful condition on Friday.
Audit is only fair to the influence of dress to say,
that ween the fair sex devote themselves to
parading that lawn, they do not allow any such
trifles as spi rts to disturb their sweet placiduy of
mind. The gallant athlete may be beating the
field or “breaking a record,” his comrades be
wildly entrea ing him to “put it on,” and the air
be rent witu cheers-but the lawn girl never
minds: she walks from the gates to the smoking-
paddock, and from the smoking-paddock to the
gates, in her pretty gloves and her pleated skirt,
and thinks what a beautiful world it is—while she’s
there Perhaps she is not far wrong, either. And
we admit some of the costumes, among which
dark brown and blue prevailed, were quite charm-
ing enough to justify beauty in feeling just a little
aeU-consciousnes i of its own worth. A few only
of the dresses must suffice. Mrs. Wells, from
North Shore, wore a rich and striking toilette,
consisting of claret velvet bodice, claret silk skirt,
scarf drapery of red and gold brocade, with bonnet
to correspond. A Darling Point belle looked ex-
tremely pretty in a seal brown velvet, brown
trimmings, and cream hat. Two noticeable cos-
tumes were of light slate silk, coat tails, and
y lea ted skirts. Mrs. J. Williamson wore a hand-
some hi ick brocade, with dark bonnet and scarlet
flowers. A Jittle favourite of the Cathedral Fayre,
from Elizabeth-street, in dark blue velvet bodice,
cashmere skirt d la Mary Anderson, the interest-
ing, winsome little face shaded beneath an olive
brouze velvet hat, made a pretty picture. A quiet
yet elegant dress was worn by au always notice-
able Glebe Point belle, of black velvet skirt, grey
cloth overdress, velvet cuffs and pockets, with a
charming i.igh-crowned hat with grey plumes. A
myrtle green brocade, with small jockey cap,
attracted much attention; as did also an electric
blue costume with surah trimmings.
. . •
At 9 o’clock on Monday night, Sir Patrick
Jennings opened the bazaar at Waverley In aid of
St. Clare’s school. Purchasing a ticket from an
importunate vendor, who bailed us up in a dark
and suspicious-looking lane outside—for the good
Sisters of St. Clare had quite inexplicably for-
gotten to send us one—we entered, and to our pro-
found amazement, got right inside without being
asked to buy a doll or evenaebromo of a cow.
Such forbearance was almost staggering; but it
was temporary. The fact is. Sir Patrick was in
possession of the house: behind him were Lady
Jennings, Mrs. J. Martin, Father P. L. Dunne, and
others; and before him a small but select audience,
and a number of predaceous assistants laden with
albums, cruet stands, and lists purporting to repre-
sent shares in art-unions or tontines. Sir Patrick
paid some nice compliments to the good Sisters of
St. Clare for their efforts in aid of the school. He
admitted s ,me people objected to bazaars; but
the experience of thess who had to carry through
large undertakings, proved them the best way of
raising money. And the money must he got. As
the State refused them money for teaching the
tenets of their cre®d, and they were determined
not to separate secular education from those
tenets, money they must have. Hence the bazaar,
which would be conducted in an unobjectionable
maimer. Sir Patrick then descended the platform,
and the pretty assistants at once attacked him.
And they attacked everyone else, too; and it was
only in the intervals of our dodging their well-
meant attentions, that we noted that the princi-
pal stalls were kept by Mrs. Hewlett, Mrs.
John Martin, and the Sisters of St. Clare. Misses
Brewer and Barlow were active and attractive
at a pretty flower-stall; two assistants ran a fruit
booth, and a cosy retreat was cornered off with
little tables for the celebrated noong Shan tea,
which Quong Tart had “in the most generous
manner ” presented to the bazaar. Presently, two
policemen entered. Bearimr in mind the fate of
tie 25 Wellington young ladies, who narrowly
escaped languishing in prison for the crime of
carrying raffle lists, we expected an immediate
suspension of business. Not at all. Instead, a
courageous maiden tackled the solemn repre-
sentatives of Her Majesty’s peace, and audaciously
wanted to “put down their names ” fora “sofy”
cushion. The foorce smiled grimly, but never
took his hands from his pockets. Ever since we
were a little boy we have regarded the majestic
“peeler” as something more than an ordinary
human being, and his adamantine firmness under
the ordeal of wiles and smiles that opened on him,
convinced us. He was rock. As regards the other
ladies, they were persistent as usual, and we are
not at all sure that it’s expedient to employ very
little ones. If this sunny climate produces natur-
ally precocious children, certainly, bazaar-work
will produce ■ reternaturally precocious ones.
Their best point is, that little girls only ask for
little sums. But they asked us so often; that even-
tually we had to come away. Our pockets are
filled with cigarettes, woolwork, and a terra-cotta
apostle; and our memory with visions of a

TheWoollahra Private Assembly had their
first gathering this] year, on Fri ay, at Needs’s
Booms. Although it was raining heavily, nearly
150 came, out of 180 tickets issued. Commence-
ment was made at 8 o'clock sharp, and 20 dances
were completed, also two extras, by 1 a.m., when
the tram, as usual, rolled up, much to the disgust
of the honest cabbies who had waited in expect-
ancy. It was noticeable that ladies had come to
dance and enjoy it, instead of merely to show
dress and do nothing. For this reason, it would
be more congenial for us to dilate on the dancimr
than the dresses. Only that would be too personal,
wt- devote a line or two to the dresses instead.
Mrs. Dunsrnure wore a nice white silk, with Eliza-
bethan ruffle, flounced with nun’s veiling, and
spotted w>tn swansdown and pearls. Mrs. Birk-
rayre looked well in white satin ; and Mrs. Russell
in a plain cream silk with two rows of pansies in
front. In old gold plush skirt and plain bodice,
Miis Watson proved herself an accomplished
dancer. Another young lady was determined not
to discard the pronounced hue of terra-cotta. A
ulue silk, with nun’s veiling skirt, looked excel-
lent. Plain pink was plentiful. Nearly every
suburb represented. Baumann’s catering richer-
chd, and the music of Mr. Ernest Needs’s band was
all that could be desired, and it was considerably
complimented bv the committee. The chocolate
programmes, gilded with flowers, were novelties,
and we ought to men+ion that not only have the
tine Nithsdale Rooms been re-decorated with
ferns, brackets, and various pretty ornaments, but
the floor of the little room has been rendered per-
fectly luxurious in its polished smoothness.

The committee of the Mercantile Quadrille
Assembly at Orange were gratified by an attend-
ance of nearly a hundred on their opening night,
which demonstrated the popularity of the Assem-
bly ; and some rich and elegant costumes were
displayed. Tnere was a neat programme of tweive
dances, which, with extras, were managed by mid-
night. to the music of a string band conducted by
Mr. H. Green. Peace and plenty reigned at the
retresbment table. A charming Jewish lady, in
white satin tastefully relieved with roses, carried
off the honour of belle, for which distinction the
atti active mistress of the Superior School, in
white and cardinal, closely competed. A stately
brunette in blue, and another in white with
cardinal, each attracted much interest. The
daughter of the month may be said to have
held her own against the counter attractions of a
charmer in pink. A trio from the Terrace com-
manded marked attention. The exquisite dancing
of a blonde in black, and another In brown,
with her companion in fawn, secured full pro-
grammes. The stately wife of the Mayor was
in a rich costume of black, and the daughter in
navy blue. The bride of the season still continued
to exercise her charms over the sterner sex. The
wife of a bookseller in a rich dress of white and
scarlet, and the better halves of a popular knight
of the hammer and the C.P.S. added their attrac-
tiveness. The namesake of a Scottish lord in a
stylish dress of blue, and a stately captivator in
white from the same street, were noted lor their
charming naivetd. The “Exchange” contributed
a petite damsel in black, whos« attentions wfere
confined te the chosen few. A fair one in white
satin wreathed with ivy, and the sisters of one of
the energetic secretaries in blue, had numerous
admirers. An accomplished blonde from Summer-
street in white, was in eager request. Several
ladies sacrificed their usual pleasing appearance
at the shrine of fashion by the treatment their
coiffures had received at the hands of their hair-
dresser.

Notwithstanding the inclement state of
the weather,40 couples made their appearance at the
second dance of the Gleoe Point Private Assembly
Club. Ingham s music was voted Al, and Calla-
ghan's catering very good. Blue predominated m
the dr, sses. Brisbane and Melbourne were repre-
sented by tastefully dressed and beautitul dancers,
la cream cashmere trimmed with satin and silver
braid, aud blue satin and white Jace, respectively,
a favourite dancer appeared in maroon satin,
lengthy and circular, with an elder sister in
s lmon broche and black lace; a friend from Rose-
bank witb them in heliotrope brochd trimmed with
pansies. Two f ar voung damsels created a great
sensafon in black velvet bodices and trimmings,
with loose flowing cashmere skirts ; one with a
blue satin-lined Mercedes collar. A charming
widow in cream corded silk and black Spanish lace
danced excellently. Glebe Point had several
pretty representatives; chiefly a claret silk and
cream lace: a blue satin bodice and nun’s veiling
skirt; a pink cashmere, &c. Toxteth-road sent a
lady in cream cashmere and gold braid, and a sister
In pink trimmed with pink satia. Stanmore had a
white satin, nicely made, and a white rauslin-trim
med cardinal, wun a relative debutante in cream
cashmere niched bodice. Two of the most hand-
some dresses were—crushed strawberry broche
waterfall, over blue oatmeal cloth ; and a pmk
satin trimmed with cashmere and lots of pearls.
Black satins were worn by several ladies, married
and single—one especially nice with beautiful lace
sleeves, which, together with a pretty face, formed
the picture of the evening, and —“ quoe palmam
meruit ferat" —was belle. The committee’s arrange-
ments are now very good indeed, a programme
(nicely got up) of the dances being ended just in
time to catch the last tram.

The By wong Club, Botany, which a roll of
over three hundred members during the p ist year
shows to be flourishing, held its annual meeting on
the 19th in the Club premises, Mr. J. B. Olllffe,
M.P,, in the chair. Various improvements have
been carried out, with a view to promoting the
comfort of members, and a vote of thanks was
given to the officers, after which all adjourned to
supper. The Bywong Club’s anniversary will be
celebrated by a Garden party, dinner and dancing
in the Sir Joseph Banks pavilion on Wednesday,
11th Juse.

To - morrow night (Friday) occurs the
annual bail of the Glebe Rowing Club in West’s
Rooms, Castlereagh-street. Plain and fancy dress
are both to be worn, so that ladies will be able to
suit themselves and please everyone else. A large
committee have been organising the ball,
determined to make it a success, and it is expected
about two hundred guests will enjoy the occasion.

Within a few years, Petersham has de-
veloped that fondness for dancing which seems to
follow, in almost every suburb, immediately on
the erection of a Town Hall. By a popular fletien,
dancing is supposed to be something maintained
for the especial benefit of ladies. Whenever balls
are got up, It is always for the delectation of the
fair sex, you notice—never for the gentlemen.
They only join in—like members of Parliament
join tontines—purely for the sake of others. This
amuses us. we have seen dudes live on the
thoughts of a ball for three weeks beforehand,
and ttien “ Trollope ” for three months afterwards
about the El Teh conquest they made of the heart
of nearly every good-looking girl who had the
misfortune to he introduced to them. Society
cher’shes too many of these little one-sided
fictions, and we have no hesitation in launching
the statement that at least three sexes enjoy
a good ball—men, women, and dudes. That is
the reason why, on last Friday, so many pleased
faces and pattering feet gathered at Petersham
for the first “social” of the Winter; and, not-
withstanding the very unfavourable weather, an
enjoyable evening was spent. Stringed music was
engaged, and light refreshments were set out for
the visitors, who were not confined to Petersham
residents only. Mr. G. Pile, president, was there,
with two fair daughters. The belie of the floor
was generally conceded to be a young lady from
Darlinghurst, with a tasteful toilette of blue satin
and pink, and a face “all sweetness and light”
which would have delighted the apostle ol the
beautiful. Two sisters from Stanmore looked very
fascinating, in pink and ivy leaves, and pale blue
trimmed with lace. A young married lady from
Burwood ornamented the hall with a pretty face
and a handsome dress of claret satin and velvet,
set off with laces of same colour and white. From
Newtown was a young lady in a charming cream
cashmere and pearls, with Elizabethan ruff. An-
other kalizoic young lady wore a handsome white
satin with a full-sized Niagara curve, and clasped
at the waist with a claret Swiss belt. Among other
nice toilettes were a blue sateen trimmed with car-
dinal, worn by a bright little brunette of the neigh-
bourhood, and a black satin and pink cashmere,
worn by a lightsome little dancer. Mr, R. Bone,
jun., was the hon. secretary, and a good one. too.
An extremely pretty programme, with sixteen
dances, kept the company brisk until the mid-
night train.

Mr. G. Jamieson (of Prince, Ogg, and Co.)
gave a ball on Friday night last, at the Ashfleld
Town Hall, and a gay and fashionable assemblage
was the result of his invitations. About 150 were
present in ail, and in the enjoyment of the affair
no one regretted having braved the boisterous
weather to attend. Torning decorated the hall,
and the Compagnoni Co. provided an elegant
supper-table and standing refreshments. The
music was by the well-known Kopff and Austin’s
band, and was consequently lively and true lo
time. A special train took a number of guests
back townwards soon after 2 o’clock, after which
a “tag” to the programme was added by the
remaining ones, mostly local residents.

On Monday evening, the annual dinner of
Consular Representatives in the city took place at
CompagnonTs. Dr. Krauel (Germany) and Mr.
E. M. Paul (Russia) occupied the chair and vice-
edair, eighteen other representatives being pre-
sent, besides twelve other gentlemen whose social
or official status entitled them to the distinction of
an invitation. All wore their orders and insignia.
Toasts were: The Queen, Rulers of the countries
represented, the Governor, Guests, the Colony,
and the Chairman. The menus were elegant works
of art; the tables, covered with blood-red cloth
edged with green ferns and a white bordering, had
a peculiarly rich appearance, and the repast was a
choice one.

Foundation stone will be laid with some cere-
monies, next month probably—Last week, Mr.
Richard Mirsch, merchant of this city, was fare
welled by his friends with an excursion to Boitany.
They sat down to an evening banquet at the Sir

My Dear Beiae,—We have Miss Alice Sydney
Burvett here again »!vlnir
Now. I never knew a more courageous lady
courageous, did I say ? Well, I might have used a
■word which would sound less polite, but be nearer
the truth. It requires a great deal of nerve to give
r recital before a Sydney audience, who have
heard Madam” Kellermann, Miss Thomnson.
Messrs. M‘Quade, Moss, Huonerbein, and last, but
not least. Hen Vogrioh, besides the magnificent

severe a tax on the public,

matinees are over, I inink we shall miss them some-

the events of the week. It was announced on the
programmes last Wednesday that another series
will shortly be given, but it will not tend to
popularise them if one cannot whisper to a
neighbour during a performance without meriting
a rebuke—aye, and a public rebuke, too. The
fadv who was so scandalised by the whispering,
whfch no one heard, will surely diecover that when
she is in Rome she must do as Rome does, and it
we want to exchange Ideas sh* must allow us
to do so without bringing us to book about it.
Mrs Polk had a benefit last Friday night, and it
was very mortifying that it should turn out to be
such a wet night as it did. That only could be the
reason of the meagre attendance, for the lady is so
popular that we were quite prepared to see the
hnnvo House crowded. A. beautiful basket of
flowers was handed to the beneficiaire after the
first act, but the noise of the rain quite marreu
part of the performance. Mrs. Polk s costumes
were very brilliant and tasteful. A crimson satin
skirt front width covered with rich cream
Roman embroidery; the Jacket, of Picsii. wa*
short and out square at the neck. In the last act
her dress was most beautiful. The palest blue
satin nrofusely trimmed with biscuit-coloured
mffiese lace and deep blue velvet. The whole of
the back width and train was covered with the
lace, which was threaded here and there with the
velvet, and down the front of the skirt
pink flowers were embossed in velvet and
Satin. A targe bunch of deep pink flowers
on the left - shoulder, completed one of the
handsomest toilettes I have seen on any stage. I
like the orchestra at th© Opera House .the musi-
cians are all picked, so what music you hoar there
Is sure to be good. Some time since, a piccolo
obligato used to be given during the evening, but
I never thought it was properly appreciated, for It
really was very fine.
You grumble at my neglecting to give you any
Block dresses of late, but, my dear, you forget
what weather we have had. There is one thltm’to
be said In favour of crinolines, and that is they
keep one’s dresses clean in muddy weather. No
matter how short the skirt is, it
i ages to knock around tbo boots and wipe off all
the mud, but with a crinoline it is held out of
harm's way, and all is comfortable and nice. Cer-
tainly, it also shows off the feet to perfection, or
imperfection, as the case may be; and it only
needs to walk round the Block on a wet day to be
convinced how vastly the latter quality pre-
dominates among Sydney girls. So you see, dear,
after all,the much abused crinolines have some use,
even it it only amounts to keeping the skirts clean
and giving a small-footed girl a chance of de-
stination. Amongst the new materials for winter
wear I admire most the ottoman cloth. It is, soft,
clinging, and substantial, and the favourite trim-
ming for it is plush ribbon velvet about an inch
and a half in width, which is shown in all shades to
match the material. Velvet and plush tippets are
still in favour with the shoulders very much ridged.
Four-in-hands always look stylish, whether made
of the dullest woollen checks or of the richest
Paisleys or brocades. The latest in veils is a long
piece of soft black tulle, say about two yards,
which is crossed at the back of the head and
brought round and tied in a large bow under the
chin. The tulle must be very soft and fine, or It
will be too bunchy.
But here I am gossiping with you at the risk of
a good scolding for neglecting everything else, as
I invariably do when I write to you. So you see
what I go through for your sake, but then ! always
was and always shall be,
Tour loving.

Twenty of the Liberal newspapers in Eng-

decent people. We are now speaking merely on
behalf of the public. Our own tastes are tropical,
and we are suited already.
Here is the reward of good nature. We
put in a nice little paragraph about the Maitland
Mail, some weeks ago. And this is how the irate
ant who edits that journal turns upon us:—“The
slangy smartness of the Bulletin is too often ob-
tained at the expense of truth.” This is cruel, yet
contains a grain of comfort. It proves to us that
we have never obtained any smartness at the ex-
pense of the Maitland Mail.
About the very latest, and neatest dodge

On one side of the intermission checks is printed

What the hona fide unemployed want
from the Government is judicious treatment;
what they get is spasmodic charity and bureau-
cratic red-tapeism. Why can’t Stuart place live
men in charge of the Labour Office, with instruc-
tions to deal with those in search of work as with
men, not as with chattels, and directly, not through
those whose sole credentials were the votes of the
most leathery-lunged gathered together at a most
informal meeting ?
The temperance people are now quoting
Liebig. Liebig, it will be remembered, was the
author of the meat extract that bears his name. It
was the only digestible work he ever accomplished.
However, he says: “The drlnkerejot whisky and
brandy are going to certain death.” We suppose
this conveys an inference that the drinkers of
gluger-aie and sarsaparilla are on the way to a
vague Immortality. Let them; we are happy.
Only in a choice between certaln [ death and ginger-
ale, the grisly terror would take the first prize as
far as we are concerned.
Of course, you would like to know the
latest freak ot fashion. Well, it is the adoption of
mimic household Implements, such as frylng-paus,
gridirons, gravy spoons, strainers, meat spits
and Dutch ovens for brooches and charms. And
very nice useful looking ornaments they make too.
We are glad to see fashion taking this turn. Per-
haps some day in the oiepusculous future we may
expect to see the tender creatures we cherish,
take a fancy to using these implements instead of
wearing miniatures of them as ornaments, and let-
ting the hired girl smash the originals.
(Jarcoak Mary remarksThe General
Post Office is little better than a den of thieves.
A gentleman of our acquaintance, a tew weeks
ago, posted a five-pound note to his father ;
it duly fell into the hands of the thieves, and
the sender wrote to the General Post Office con-
cerning it, but the authorities have not even
condescended to reply. Mmilar complaints are
constantly cropping up in the country papers.
The worst of it is that registration is no security ;
rather the reverse, since it indicates spoil, and in
reality only makes the Postal Department an-
swerable for the delivery of the envelope.
Booth is good at a bull. He told his audi-
ence the other night that if they all signed tte
pledge that evening, there would be no drunks at
the Police Court next morning Then his audience
laughed ; and he plung* d again, by remarking
that if all the people of Sydney kept the pledge
there would be no drunks. Then the audience
laughed seven devils of laughs worse than the
first, and Booth pulled himself together for a final
effort. He explained that what he meant was that
there had never been a total abstainer arrested for
being drunk, and the explanation was hailed with
more joy than if nlnety-and-nine just men had
chopped a cord ot logic.
The greatest brigand of modern times is
dead. His name was Clprlano la Gala, and he was
convicted of over fifty murders and about five
thousand robberies. He has been residing in Elba
for some years past, chained to the wall— on ac-
count of a weakness in his back, wo presume. He
took it very much to heart that King Humbert
never came to see him when he was dying, nut
of course King Humbert was too high up in the
profession to visit a common robber. Ciprlano
would probably have been a C.M.G. if he had been
out here. Perhaps, however, as they say when
infants die, he is better where he is. There are
plenty of C.M.G.’s there, too.
“Nerissa,” a Qoulburn poetess of the
Della-Crusca school, passed to the Hereafter some
little while back. A sorrowing friend, who has
dropped into elegiac verse on her account, tells us
in one place that, like the short-lived brilliant
meteor, passed she into endless niaht; and, in an-
other, that the “angles,” missing her from the
realms above, searched, and on the earth they
found her, bore her thence to a home more fair.
Fiom all of which we gather that the realms
above are realms of endless night, and that a home
in utter darkness is more fair than was the de-
plored one’s in Goulburn; which may quite pos-
sibly be true, only the statement’s a little angular
on “Nerissa s” people, as well as on the realms
above.
About this time, 1860 years ago, ten lepers
were miraculously made clean, in a small out-of-
the-way hole called Galilee; but so very little did
they think of the favour none them, that only one
of the gang thought it worth his while 10 trot back
and thank his benefactor. Human nature appears
to be pretty much the same now as it was in those
days, for we find that out of the whole caboodle of
clergymen who were recently praying meniscives
knock-kneed and bald-headed to obtain rain, only
one has been found to “return thanks to God,”
and that one comes from Lithgow. And, by the
way, this reminds us of a good tale told by Car-
lyle of an Annandale farmer, who, with his family,
was praying with 40-parson power for a “dry hay-
time.” Just as the crowd was in full devotional
swing, however, a perfect deluge of ram suddenly
burst upon the district, upon wtiiuh the disgusted
farmer jumped up off his knees and exciaimed,
“ Oh I I say, Lord - look here—this is positively tsq
ridiculous.”

A Queensland butcher, driving a lot of fat
beasts along a narrow mountain road to his
slaughter-yards near Cairns, met a man who by
galloping into the mob scattered it right and left.
The butcher, mad, went for that man with his
stockwhip. A second man, riding up. asks the
angry one does he know who they are ? “A pair
of damned fools,” is his truthful response; which
he felt to be not a whit the less applicable to them
when he learned that they were a Judge and a
Crown Prosecutor on their travels.
The Victorians who were foolish enough
to send exhibits to the recent Parramatta Juvenile
Exhibition are mad with the slow-coaches who
ran that measly show. And they have a right to
be mad. Those worthy Parramattans returned
the Victorian exhibits (some of them in a dis-
gracefully broken, torn, or otherwise mutilated
condition) to Melbourne, but neglected to send
any letter of advice with them to their Victorian
agent—hence the exhibits lay at the Queen's Ware-
house for three months. But to a Sleepy Hol-
lower, three months in a matter of business or
correspondence is as one day. You may take a
Parramatta man to the grindstone, but you can’t
make him sharp.
W. Gibson, of Gympie, is a man who ap-
preciates popular confidence. He is not one of
your Palmerstons or Disraelis, who receive with
equal indifference the applause or hoots of the
crowd. And so, having served Gympie well, and
feeling a natural sort of a sinking in the stomach
on leaving an appreciative community, he deter-
mined to set an example of patriotic gratitude.
He arranged, before retiring from the blaze of
popularity, that a suitable successor should follow,
and keep the fire burning. This is his notice:—" I
beg to state that my successor, Sam Sing, is a
thoroughly experienced charcoal burner, and 1 am
confident that he will give every satisfaction to
my constituents. —W. Gibson.”
Says Granny: “It is consolatory to know
that our representative (at Calcutta Exhibition)
was courteously entertained at Government

the Nizam is distinguished in a certain sense.
Though only seventeen and a half years old, he is a
confirmed sensualist, plunged into the excesses of

concubines; and he play* this game of lust and
robbery in security, the tranquillity of the robbed
being guaranteed by the British. Yes, he is a most
distinguished young man. We trust Franklyn
slobbered with sufficient effusiveness.
The Wise Man had a level head when he
said “ The beginning of quarrels is as when one
letteth out water, for, verily, one never can toll
when the thing will stop.” Last Thursday, Mr.
Joseph Silberberg and anotherjknight of the pen-
cil were standing in front of Tattersall’s discus-
sing the question as to whether there was a per-
sonal devil or not, when some person or persons,
unknown, took Silberberg under the ear with a
lot of dried peas. This seemed to distract Joseph s
attention from the argument, and, turning round
to a by - stander, he remarked that.the role of.a
practical joker or natural buffoon didn t suit tne
party addressed at all, and the best thing he could
do would be to “go and drive Mother Hill about,
whereupon the by-stander began to drive Joseph
about in such a vigorous style that he drove him
into the gutter. Next day, the by-stander en-
riched the revenue to the extent of £4 19s., and
Joseph called far tenders to build a new veran-
dah over his eyebrows.
Talk about hard times! Why, we’re posi-
tively rolling in riches. At least some of us are; for
from a satisfactory little return just out, we find
that since the year of grace, 1850, down to the year
of die-grace, 1884, 261 families of dukes, marquises,
and saris, embracing 4536 scions, asd filling 8-28
offices, have obtained from the taxes the sum of
£66,247,242. Who wouldn’t be a “dook” or a
“markios” after reading that lot? Why, its
better than being either a recognised saiat or a
n.ght policeman. And if anyone is mad to know
who the more favoured of thi* band of titled
beggars are, they can run their eyes over the
following list: —Argylls £140,000, Atholes £417,000,
Beauforts £540.000, Bedfords £554,000, Graftons
£1,115,850, Marlboroughs £638,250, Richmonds
£1,600,000, Wellingtons £1,425,000, Glenrioardes
£635,000, Hertfords £598,000. Spme of these days
we may step across and enquire if there s a vacancy
for a nice, respectable son-in-law in the families of
either the Richmonds, Wellingtons, or Graftons.
The Hon. J. B. Patterson, M.L.A., is com-
ing back to Victoria. He has been addressing the
frugal swains who played pitch and toss with him
in his youth, and they have all gone to bed with
the notion that Jim is King of Australia, and lives
in a house built of golden bricks. Jim is now
manager of a Financial Agency in Melbourne, and
was a Minister. Parkes has floated a financial
agency. Sir Julius has floated a financial agency.
MTlwraith has gone home to finance. Service is a
financier. Duffy is not bad at finance. Then why
are we poor ? And why do we not go home and
pick the hawthorn blossom, and fish for trout with
a pin in the clear brook that threw back a chubby
face, so long ago, or visit the old woman who gave
us milk and bread and honey when we were an
eight-year-old truant, and had lost ourselves and
were starving, when three miles from home?
Why don’t we drop in, in a plug hat, and black suit,
and say, in a bass voice, “ here, good woman, is a
sovereign.” And why don’t we round up the
villagers, and deliver a speech about our great-
ness? Alas, why d=m’t we? Well, we haven’t
gone into politics, and we can’t finance. Therefore
we don’t go home.
Beyond all doubt, the Sir Boyle Roche of
our Legislative Assembly is the Hon. Mr. Abigail.
Speaking on Dr. Tarrant’s Medical Bill, the other
day, this gifted orator defended the unlicensed
jalap-dispensers of this city from the strictures
passed upon them, and, amongst other profound
rubbish, observed, “ Let me tell you, gentlemen,
that some of these ss-ealled quacks have fre-
quently been the means of restoring to life scores
of unfortunate persona who were murdebbd by
the blatant, boastful medical faculty.” Here the
speaker looked significantly at a couple of the
“faculty,” who happened to be present at the
time, and when the yells of laughter which greeted
his scathing assertion ceased,he fairly out-Abigailed
Abigail by declaring, "Yes, gentlemen, and what
is more, I have known some of these much-
maligned quacks to have achieved the most won-
derful success in my own family circle, when the
very best legal men in the colony had completely
failed.” This was too much for the gravity
of the House. Hon. members fairly roiled on
the floor in fits, the Speaker buried his head
between his knees, his portly frame heaved in con-
vulsions, just as if;he had accidentally swallowed a
small spring mattrass, and the Chairman had to
plant behind a Ministerial bench and kick himself
to sustain his dignity. As a rule, the proceedings
of our jaw jaw shop have not been over lively of
late, but whenever Senator Abigail strikes the
floor, the show is as good as a nigger minstrel
crowd, with fourteen corner-men, and thirty-seven
interlocutory Mase’r Johnsons.
On board a French convict ship at Nou-
mea, Granny’s “ special ” recently noted a young
Englishman, who, like himself, was taking stock
of the vessel, its interior economy,’&c. “ On the
side of the deck-cabin,” writes Granny’s own,
“ between the two steps of stairs leading up to the
quarter-deck a scroll had been painted, bearing
tne word and date, ‘ Fontenoy, 1745.’ The date, of
course, referred to the event In Austrian history,
but the young man was not aware of this. * Bless
me, 1745 I Gracious, what an old tub I ’Stonlshlng:
never heard of the like. Won’t they be surprised
when 1 tell them at home I’—and the young man
made a careful entry in his note-book, and will no
doubt, when he returns home to his mother and
sisters, open their eyes at the astounding informal
tion he has collected,” And supposing the young
man did make such an entry, would he be such an
astounding prig as the ass who imagines that a
French snip-decorator would chronicle “ Fonte-
noy ” as an event la Austrian history—" Fonte-
noy,” at which lamous fight English, Hanoverians,
Dutchmen, and Austrians, under Butcher Cumber-
land, showed Johnny Crapaud their backs, what
time (for drummers)
“ it was pleasant to rattle
The sticks and to follow old Saxe ”?
Nat Copeland was a gay bachelor residing
in Fitzroy (Vic.), and Nat was impressionable. If
he had read old Weller’s advice to his son Sam—
“ My boy, be wery careful o widders ail ye’r life”—
he must have either forgotten or entirely dis-
carded it. Nat had a weakness for supper beer;
and, about eight weeks ago, he went into the
Swan Hotel, Gertrude-street, for the usual supply
of that comforting beverage, when he saw a buxom
young widow sitting in the parlour, reading a book.
As we said before, Nat was susceptible to tke
charms of female loveliness, and, to use his terse
and cheerful style, he got “struck on her.” He
learnt that the dashing little woman had a regular
income of £1 a wees, sure, besides an expectant
legacy—so he promptly laid siege to her tenner
heart, and wooed and won and wedded her ere a
moou had waxed and waned. He forthwith endowed
Mrs. C. with his earthly wealth, wnioh was Invested
in stocking a small snop, but ere another month
had fled, the quondam widow presented Nat with
a daughter. "Whereupon he realised the truth of
the old saw, “ Marry in haste and repent at lei-
sure.” Nat’s first act of repentance was to turn
his lawful wedded wife out of doors, and we next
find the happy pair in the Carlton Police Court, she
sueieg her lord and master for maintenance, and
Nat assuring the Bench that he was only in receipt
of 10s. 6d. per week, a modest sum enough to keep
hou«e on. So the Bench decided that he should
pay the missus os, a week, and Nat does not hold
very exalted oninions on “widders” now, espe-
cially sentimental ones.
An Anglo-Saxon was recommended to try
a hath tout complet whilst he was visiting Vienna.
He accordingly went to the Dianan Bad, and was
souaevhat surprised to find that the price was two
gold ducats. The bath and dressing-rooms into
which he was ushered were, however, most
luxuriously fitted up. Whilst he was admiring
thum, an attendant of the female persuasion
entered. She was simply dressed in Quaker gray,
and wore a small white apron, the strings of which
were daintily tied in a bow-knot behind. Her hair
was gentillement frisee, and a little standing-up
collar clasped her cream-white throat. “Hoes
monsieur wish anything?” “Oh, nothing, thank
you; nothing at all. I kave everything I want.”
A faint smile came over the dryad’s face. The
Anglo-Saxon first blushed and then, provoked
beyond measure to be so much embarrassed about
nothing bowed her out, seized the door and
closed it. The very next evening he dined
out, in a mixed company of ladies and
gentlemen. About the middle of the dinner
he got to talking with the gentleman oa his
left. “ In our country ” said he, " we hare not the
■lightest conception of the luxury of your baths.”
“Indeed!” “ Not the slightest, I assure you. We
think a shilling quite enough to pay for a bath.”
“ But it is less ia Vienna.” “ How can that be, when
I paid two ducats ? ” “ There was some mistake—
there was some mistake.” “ i here was no mistake.
To be sure, my bath was tout com-” Here he
stopped. Some one had given him a violent blow

There was an amused look on the ladies’ faces—

by inspiration, he saw it all. His bath had been
decidedly incomplete.
We rejoice to observe that the Bvknooze
is going straight in for levering up the masses, es-
pecially since the new Bishop took hold out here.
But there is a way of doing these things gently,
and by degrees. It is not well to dismay beginners
in morality and well-behaving with recondite de-
ductions. We may have explored the profoundest
depths of knowledge—we may have dredged the
lowest and farthest gulfs of Philosophy in our un-
ceasing search for the causes of things; but in
front of comparatively unreasoning folk, we
should not spill out the result too suddenly, lest
the glory of our “ take ” should altogether abash
others from the deep strange levels of wisdom,
rather than stimulate them to search. The aver-
age human mind needs educating and training
up to the reception of a great truth. So we
think Alfred, however well - meaning, was a
little indiscreet, considering that he addresses
a mixed constituency, whereof each member can’t
be a Kant or a Herbert Spencer, the other day,
when he let the cat out of the bag in this sudden
manner: “ Always be brave, chivalrous, noble. A
mean, skulking, cowardly, hypocritical, and tho-
roughly despicable disposition will never be assidu-
ously cultivated by that nobleman of Nature’s
handiwork, the true gentleman.” Again we say
that this disclosure should have been led up to
with consummate tact, and let dribble out in sec-
tions, instead of being rashly placed before a
totally unprepared public in one issue. We must
confess that the discovery that these attributes
are not “assiduously cultivated” by true gentle-
men has been a facer to us, and we’ve had a fear-
ful time of it since. We can see now, but too
plainly, where we barked our shins in our blind
stumblings after the great and good. We have
been assiduously cultivating just the wrong sort
of specialities, ail on account of Alf.’s not having
spoken out long ago. Why, oh, why didn’t he give
these matters his attention before we went so far'
for now, like Sir Gareth, we seem as one
That all In later, sadder age begins
To war against ill uses of a life,
But these from all his life arise, and cry
“Thou hast made us lords and canst not put us
down I”
We dreamed of being ultimately a millionare, and
riggingup a memorial window to John Br no,
to Leopold; ergo, we were mean, we had hopes of
attaining a high post in the Civil Service; ergo, we
were skulking, we yearned to be a captain of
Volunteers; ergo, we were cowardly, we thought
it possible v e might triumph through Grace
as a preacher ; ergo, we were hypocritical,
we decided as a dernier ressort to be a
C.M.G. ; ergo, we were thoroughly despicable.
There’s meanness for your millionaire, skulking
for your Civil Servant, cowardice for your cap-
tain, hypocrisy for your parson, and thorough des-
spicability for your C.M.G. And now, after our
disposition is just nicely formed, Bennett must sit
up of a night thinking, and thinking, and think-
ing, and find out we’te on the wrong tack alto-
gether, and blurt it out in his plain, blunt way.
But, however sincere he is in the promulgation of
the new doctrine, and however many anxious
hours of self-communing it may have cost him to
formulate it, we hold it was rash to divulge the
whole scheme at once. It's too new. Nobody
ever thought of it that way at all. The world isn’t
ripe for such startling revelations. He shouldn’t
have shown his hand to everybody, yet awhile.
There’s whole heaps of money in original wrinkles,
and now everybody’s in possession of the fruits of

The Bad and Worthless
are never imitated or counterfeited. This is es
pecially true of a family medicine, and it is positive
proof that the remedy imitated is of the highest
value. As soon as it had been tested and proved
by the whole world that Hop Bitters was the pur-
est, best and most valuable family medicine on
earth, many imitations sprung up and began to
steal the notices in which the press and the people
of the country had expressed the merits of H. B.,
and in every way trying to induce suffering in-
valids to use their stuff Instead, expecting to make
money on the credit and good name of H. B.
Many others started nostrums put up in similar
style to H. B., with variously devised names in
which the word “Hop ” or “ Hops” were used in a
way to induce people to believe they were the
same as Hop Bitters. All such pretended remedies
or cures, no matter what their style or name is»
and especially those with the word “Hop” or
“ Hops 1 ’in their name or in any way connected
with them or their name, are imitations or
counterfeits. Beware of them. Touch none of
them. Use nothing but genuine American Hop
Bitters, with a bunch or cluster of green Hops on

The use of this valuable mouth wash insures
entire freedom from toothache and decay of the
teeth. There are three kinds, distinguished by a
Yellow, Green, and Red Silk Thread attached to
the bottles. That with the Yellow stops instantly
the most Violent Toothache. That with the Green
is invaluable to persons who suffer periodically
from toothache, sensitiveness of the teeth and
turns, decay and offensive breath, for by using a few
rops in a little water to rinse the mouth daily,
they will not only never suffer again, but will pre-
serve their teeth sound and white to the end. That
with the Red is for children’s use.

A PRETTY FACE.
What Is more to be desired by a young lady than
a beautiful, clear complexion? She may have
wealth, education, and all the accomplishments
which will IU. her to be an ornament to society
but if she have a sallow countenance, and her face
be covered with pimples, it will avail but little.
Let her remove the cause of all this disfigurement
by the use of Emil Frese’s Hamburg Tea, and our
word for it she will soon find her beauty fully
restored.

•Oh, bright as the glitt’ring diamond shines
Were her eyes of blue—love’s sacred mines;
Her hair, like a wreath of golden glow,
-Framed in the glorious lace below.
iHer cheeks had a blush that sham'd the rose,
Her bosom was white as driven snows;
Her lily-white hands and dainty tcet
To an artist’s eye were a heav’nly treat.

On the subject of marriage with the de-
ceased wife’s sister, a “ High Church Rector” has
been writing to the London Daily News This
good, simple-minded man lived, it appears, for
many years in Australia, and must have had a
very extensive acquaintance among gentlemen
who had espoused tue sister of their first wife, for
he writes “ Families whom I have known as re-
spectable members of r.ociety, and supporters of
the Church, looked on universally as models of
Christian behaviour and regular communicants,
are, on their return to this country, denounced by
the clergy in tho most violent language ; called by
approbious terms; driven from the altar, and
almost, if not quite, excommunicated from the
Church. As the husband is generally commanded
to separate from his wife, in too many instances
he obeys, by discarding her and his family, and
marrying another woman.” In a fair heel-and-
toe ‘‘lying” match, we don’t think that Ananias
could have given any start at all to tho “ High
Church Rector.” Setting aside the fact that the
‘•Rector’s” epistle makes it appear as though
every Australian who marries his sister-in-law
takes her and his family home to England, and im-
mediately explains all his domestic arrangements
to the parson—the notion of the latter command-
ing the tractable hubby to become again a bache-
lor. and he (poor dear “communicant,” and
“Christian model”) obeying, is very funny. Cer-
tainly, we haven’t a very exalted opinion of
communicants, but it must be remembered that
the wife would have a say over this “ excommu-
nication ” business. She might suggest the idea of
returning to Australia, and becoming respectable
members of society, supporters of the Church,
regular communicants, and models of Christian
behaviour once again. However, we will en-
deavour to express the High Church Rector’s ex-
perience in a doggrel :—
Now, Boddles had a darling wife.
And when she died he missed her
So very much, that (such is life)
Re had to take her sister.
Thro* Austral wide you’d need to look
For ones to beat the Boddles—
The sacrament they always took.
For they were Christian models.
Just twenty years had they been wed
(They’d several sons and daughters).
When Boddle took it in his head
To cross the briny waters.
And settle in his father land.
In sumptuous style and regal.
But there (as you must understand)
His marriage was illegal.
So, as the story got abroad
About this lawless union,
When Boddle went to seek the Lord
Thsy “ barred ” him at Communion.
Poor Boddle wept in dire distress,
But, quite unmoved, the “pas’on”
Explained—” You can t come here, unless
To some fresh girl you fasten.”
For days B. pondered in bis mind
The parson’s words (and morals).
Thought he, “ My wife is good and kind,
We never have had quarrels;
M And yet, although it seems unjust
To leave the wife I cherish,
I somehow feel I really must
Take sacrament—or perish.
“ Since over here (he wiped his eye
Not binding do my vows hold,
better bid my love good-bye,
And start another household.
“ ’Tis good to take a priest’s advice.
And do the thing he bids me,
Especially when—that is nice—
Of all old ties it rids me.”
Next week our Boddle took a bride—
A blushing, sweet, young creature—
To church, and then the parson cried,
“ Oh, now I’m pleased to greet yer!”
Bright, shining lights those twain became
Among the congregation—
While she who once bore Boddle’s name—
Well, she died of starvation.
A blood-curdling littlo book has just been
published by Mr. H. C. Jacobson, proprietor of the
Akaroa Mail, New Zealand. It is entitled “ Tales
of Banks, Peninsula.” A considerable portion of
the little work has been written by a Maori
clergyman, the Rev. J. W. Stack, of Akaroa, and
consists of rather startling details of the principal
massacres perpetrated on each other by different
tribes of the native population of forty or fifty
years ago. Here is one of the stories as told by an
old chief still living:—A party of Kaiapoi warriors,
having attacked and routed an opposing force,
started in pursuit of the fugitives. “As I ran
along,” said the chief, “I saw in front of me old
Upokohina, a first cousin of Te Maihara, trying to
escape. He was carrying one little child on his
back, and leading two others by hand. He called
out to the man who was pursuing him, ‘ Do not
kill me.’ Te Whakatuka, who was at a little dis-
tance, heard him be* for his life, and called out to
keep him till he came up, intending to save him.
But the old man’s relation, Te Maihara, ran
forward, crying in a loud voice, ‘ Spare my
cousin.’ Upokohina sat down, and his pur-
suers stood round him. When Te Maihara
came up, he at once rubbed noses with his rela-
tive, and with each of his children; then, without
a moment’s warning, he burled bia hatchet in the
side of the old man’s head, who fell over with a
groan. Withdrawing the hatchet, he struck each
of the children on the head, cracking their skulls
like bird’s eggs. Then, turning to Whakaluka, he
said: ‘But for your interference, I should have
spared my cousin and his children, but I could not
permit you to boast hereafter that you had
either slain or spared any of my relations. Our
honour demanded their death at my hands.’ ”
Alluding, in his preface, to the help he had rece ved
from Mr. Stack and others in the compilation of
the book, Mr. Jacobson says: “ Here is only a nose-
gay of cut flowers, and nothing is my own but the
string that binds them.” A nosegay, indeed!
Truly Mr. Jacobson is possessed of a streak of
very fine humour, almost rivalling the old war-
rior’s keen sense of honour.
“ Sweet Sixteen ” asks: “ Do we believe in
High School education for our girls ?” Well, you
better believe we do. How could any man so far
forget his self-respect as to partake of a plate of
dry hash or a “toad-in-the-hole,” which had been
cooked by a woman who never heard of the Dif-
ferential Calculus, and who couldn’t tell whether
Pons Asinorum was a branch of the Presbyterian
Synod or a new style of insect powder ? Or, how
could he ever become so degraded as to wear a
pair of striped socks that had been darned by a
wife who didn’t k low any more about iEschylus
and Sophocles than a dirty swamp frog does about
the retreat of Xerxes. “ Sweet Sixteen ” reminds
us that Juvenal once sang
“ Oh, never may the partner of my bed,
With subtleties of logic fill her head;
Enough for me if common things she know,
And boasts the little learning schools bestow.”
But why, in thunder, should we take that old
Pagan mule’s opinion on the subject? Think a
man wants to be talking aH his life to his wife
about baby’s boils, and why tho hen with the
yellow ears and the pulled tail has knocked off
laying, and all other “common things” like these?
Not a bit of it. The 19th-century man wants to
discuss the agnostic theory, and to hear all about
Joe Cook and the Silurian period; and if his
own legally-ordained wife can’t hold up her end
of the stick when arguing about these things, the
19th-century man is going to skip round and chum
in with somebody else's wife who can. D’ye hear
that, Sweet Sixteen ? And are you quite sure that
you’re not nearer to sixty times sixteen, and that
you haven’t got a single idea in your old red sand-
stone brain-pan that isn’t as old as the grey-headed
grand-mother of the Chinese empire ? Of course
we believe in High Schools, and high-toned educa-
tion for our git Is, and we long for the day when
our Sydney Morning Muffin-Wrapper will
teem with such ads. as this: — “ Wanted, by a
B.A. young lady, aged 20, a situation as plain cook
and, laundress. Would be willing to till up her
snare time by giving lessons in Greek, Latin,
French and German; Algebra, Drawing, Music,
and figure-painting to the children. Wages no
object.” When we see that day on hand, we’ll
sling up our best hat, for we’ll know the millennium
is close upon us.
Dan’l Dooberry, of 27 Blue Bear Lane,
London, is three years old, and a self-convicted
murderer; in point of fact, a fratricide. We pur-
posely start this par. off in the mildest manner
possible, because, if we let out the whole facts of
the case at once, the interest our readers would
take in Dan’l Dooberry might draw i heir attention
from the heavenly lectures of Brother Buncombe
Booth, and, perhaps, seriously interfere with their
digestive apparatus also. Mrs. Dooberry slings
suds at gentlemen’s shirts for a living, and, when
she returns home with the proceeds pf her toll,
Mr. Dooberry sits on her head till she hands over
the pool, after which he banks it with the landlord
of the Seven Dials shanty, and wraps himself
round bad rum, and discusses the troubled state
of affairs in the Soudan. Master DanT, however,
is a young gentleman of advanced ideas, and if he
is spared, will certainly rise to a very exalted posi-
tion, by the help of a flight of steps and the ver-
dict of an intelligent British jury. In his political
views, DanT is decidedly Nihilistic, and would ap-
pear to be a sort of cross between Pat Ford and
Joe Brady, with just enough of the Louise Michel
thrown in to give the amalgamation a high-toned
flavour. Mrs. Dooberry owns a mangle on this
mangle DanT has set his innocent little heart,
and he pines for the day when the machine will be
his, and he will be able to entice his unsuspecting
little playmates to poke their fingers underneath
the rollers while he playfully turns the crank, and
crushes them out like so many strands of pulver-
ized German-sausage, Up to the 30th of last
December, nothing happened to disturb the usual
tranquility of the Dooberry household.Mrs. Doo-
berry washed all day; Mr. Dooberry danced on her
ribs after tea, and then sallied off to his pub. to
get the latest tips from the seat of war, and Dan 1
sat round and gloated over the mangle like a
veritable young Robespierre in petticoats. But,
on the 21st, there came a thunderbolt crash. A
baby boy was born, and, in course of time, they
called him Joseph. In this young intruder, Dan 1
saw a dangerous rival. Joseph would grow up to
be the favourite son, and Joseph would scoop the
mangle. That, and the tax-papers, were all his
parents had to leave him. One day, however,
when Mrs. Dooberry had gone home with the
“wash,” and the Soudan politician was sleeping
off the effects of last night’s debate in the fire-
place, DanT entered into himself, and began
to discuss the crisis. When he came out
of himself, he got hold of a tomahawk,
and creeping over to the cradle, he made
dry hash of the baby’s head in the most
artistic manner possible. Not content with this,
he proceeded to hide his dreadful work in the
most effectual manner possible by eating Joseph
raw; but unfortunately for DanT, his mother re-
turned, and raised some very strong objections.
The case was actually tried last month in a London
Court, but through some miscarriage of justice,
the playful Dan 1 was discharged without a stain
upon his character. According to Sir Alfred’s
theory, DanT ought to have been hanged as a sort
of mild preventitive to his indulging in any more
of his devilish little pleasantries. However, he
was honourably acquitted, and, as the other Alf.
would say, “ we predict a brilliant career tor this
gifted young artist in the extremely useful sphere
of life to which he’s called.”

Why, not so many months ago
It cut us to the quick
To find the Duke of Marlboro’
Was wont his wife to kick.
(There’s much irascibility
Among the old Nobility.)
And ended all conjugal strife
By bolting with a girl—
She, by the bye, the lawful wife
Of Marlboro's friend—an Eari.
(What an act of incivility

The Earl, too,—as explained in Court

Himself strange goddesses had sought
And couldn’t get “ divorce.”
(There’s so much sensibility

The undying Vestal fire of one true womans
love.
Oh he, in whoso immortal soul
There lies enshrined that sacred fire,
Cares nothing how this world may roll.
He lives in realms removed and higher;
No curfew in his heirt shall toll
To quench the glorious flame whose virgins never
tire.
For him the Ossian “Joy of Grief,”
For him the Stoic’s ” paegless pain,”
For him the Mystic’s fond belief,
“ A heaven to lose and one to gain,”
•Of human joys he claims the chief.

So insidious are the first approaches of
Consumption, that thousands remain unconscious
of its presence until it has brought them to the
verge of the grave. An immediate resort to Dr.
D. Jayne’s Expectorant, upon the first appearance
of Cough, Pain or Soreness of the Throat or Chest,
would very generally preclude a fatal result, or,
in case the symptoms indicate the presence of
Latent Consumption, would tend to subdue the
violence of the disease, and thus materially assist
in prolonging the life of the patient. Use the Ex-
pectorant therefore when you take a Cold, and by
so doing prevent the necessity for its use in more
dangerous complaints. To be had of all Druggists

General Campenon, the French Minister
for War.
A returned colonist, of the usual meddlesome
type, having written to acquaint the people of
Great Britain, by the medium of the London
Times, that if the French Government persist in
their recidlviste scheme, we Australian colonists
will settle the business off-hand by seizing
New Caledonia, a portrait of the officer who
at the present juncture presides over the
armies of France has a particular interest for
Australian readers. Before we declare war
and proceed to bombard Noumea, and effect
a lodgement on Isle Nou, preparatory to
driving the frog-eating Frenchmen into the sea,
under the masterly guidance of Commander-
in-Chief Loftus, or War Minister Soft-goods
Sargood, we will aaturally ponder the features
and expression of the man upon whom the foe will
rely to organise the preparations for running
away at our martial appearance and awful front—
especially our awful front. Although General
Campenon cannot, of course, compare in respect
of military experience or tactical genius with
either our own Commander-in-Chief, th® Victorian
Field-Marshal Sargood, or the veteran Garden
Honey; still he has, in his small way, seen a little
lighting. He is of an antiquated school, as com-
pared with Sargood, whose first uniform is still
in very good preservation—which, however, may
be due to the excellence of the cloth, at 4s. 9d. per
yard, with liberal discount to the trade. Campenon
was born 1819, entered the Military College of s t.
Cyr in 1837, and passed as sub-lieutenant in 1840.
Since then he has been arrested and exiled after
the coup d’etat which placed Napoleon III. on the
throne ; was subsequently reinstated, has served
in Algeria, Italy, and China, and participated in
the war with Prussia, in 1870, taking part therein
as General of Division in a desperate and histori-
cal charge, in which he was seriously wounded.
He was among the number of those shut up in
Metz with Bazaine, and shared his subsequent cap-
tivity. On the restoration of peace, he took a
prominent part in the reorganisation of the
French army, and was chosen by Gambetta (who
probably had not heard of Sargood at the time) as
Minister for War in his Cabinet of 1881. He shared
Gambetta’s fall, and remained without Ministerial
employment until, in October last, M. Ferry
nominated him to the same position.
In military chronicles, it is the generals
and higher officers who get all the glory, the subal-
terns and rank and file coming in for none of that
dazzling article. To remedy this injustice, there
is published in New York a paper devoted to
private soldiers, another in New Orleans, another
in Louisville, and a monthly magazine in St. Louis.
In the columns of these publications the idea is to
rescue from oblivion anecdotes and incidents
known only to the private soldiers, and which help
to make accurate history. The object of one of
these publications is thus defined:—
“We sing the nameless host, unknown in song or
story, , .
Half hidden in the dazzling light of aggregated
glory;
The men whose deeds have made their chiefs re-
nowned to all futurity,
While they loom dimly through the haze of lumin-
ous obscurity;
The common herd, the rank and file, the anony-
mous immortals
Who ope but never enter through Fame’s glorious
golden portals;
Who mined and trenched and marched and toiled
with ardour unabated.
And swept across the battle-fields like whirlwinds
incarnated I
Whose grand impersonal renown adds to their
country’s glory,
But gives them not one line in song, and not one
page in story!”
Since Earl Cairns—who delights to preside
at tea-fights, and take the chair at missionary
meetings—instructed his son. Lord Gumboil, to
inform the fair Miss Fortescue that godly people
regard everyone connected with the stage as
“ little better than dirt,” lesser lights of the pro-
spective heavenly kingdom appear to have
plucked up courage to express themselves in a
similar strain. The Y. M. C. A. of Portsmouth
(Eng.), recently organized a series of entertain-
ments in aid of some charity, and engaged Mrs.
BelTington, the well-known actress, to give a few
recitations. This brought Chadband to the front
at once to denounce the Y.M.C.A. for its thought-
less wickedness. With tearful eyes, the pet local
parson expressed his opinion that “when people
had to engage an actress—as he believed Mrs. Bel-
lington to be —to give humourous recitations
under the auspices of a Christian association, he
believed it was time to expunge the word “Chris-
tian” from the title of such association.” This
sweet thing in clergymen (who, by the bye, is a
Church of England man, and not a Presbyterian)
appears to have taken special umbrage at the reci-
tations being humourous— that had a lot to do
with the performance being un-Christian, no
doubt As Mrs. Bellington is a lady of xeally
quite irreproachable character, it is only to pre-
sume that the good man’s denunciations were
directed against her artistic—and not her moral-
character. What he really meant to say was that
a Christian Association can’t countenance any en-
tertainment in the strict sense of the word. How-
ever, as this self-asserting professor of Christianity
chose to deliver himself of such rashly personal
remarks, it would be only right that his pro-
ficiency in one of its branches—muscular Chris-
tianity, for instance—should be fairly tested by
Mrs. B.’s husband. Mr. John Billington is quite
big enough to tackle an average snufliing parson.
By the way, many of the unco guid who hold
forth about the contaminating influence of the
stage would be aghast at learning that one of the
Queen’s particular friends. Lady Martin, was the
leading actress of a past generation, and that the
ex-actress’s husband edited “More Leaves from
my Diary.” But perhaps they would hold that
last un-Christian circumstance accountable for
poor John Brown’s death—in the final chapter.
The recidiviste question is claiming a good
deal of attention now-a-days, especially up Lane
Cove way. You’d hardly think that the fossils
who wile their happy hours awav amid the
oysters and other (sylvan beauties of that seques-
tered spot, would care a tinker’s malediction or a
Salvationist’s blessing about such an abstruse
subject, but it is a fact, anyhow. It happened
this way. One day last week a couple of sewing
machine agents, intent on pushing a smart busi-
ness amongst the rural population of Lane Cove,
hired a boat, and having loaded the little craft to
the gunwales with sewing machines and provisions
for the lengthened voyage, weighed anchor from
North Shore and steered their bark for Lane Cove.
They had a good passage, and everything went
smoothly until they sighted a habitation close to
the foreshore of a secluded inlet. They beached
the vessel and started right away for business, the
spokesman being an Italian from Cork. His mate,
too, had a slightly foreign accent. They inter-
viewed the proprietor of the cot, and expressed
their wish to trade either c. o. d, or on the time-
payment system, and with the eloquence peculiar
to the machine or book agent, proceeded to show
the old man the different uses to which the ma-
chines could be applied. They pointed out how,
by shifting the shuttle, or the cog-wheel, or some-
thing, it could be converted with ease into
a garden seat; and then, by an easy movement of
the patent lock-stitch, and the adjustment (of the
kilting gear, a high-class and comfortable baby’s
cradle could be formed, fitted up with noiseless
rockers and a feeding bottle; and, further,
by taking off the top, the frame could be utilised
as a wheelbarrow, or a fish-trap, and the spanners
and screwdriver would answer for can-opener and
oyster-knife respectively. The ancient party of
Lane Cove, in reply to the earnest solicitations to
trade, and the incentives held out to him, said that
he had no use for one, and declined to purchase
on any terms, and hinted that he thought they
were infernal machines of the dynamite order.
The captain of the vessel then asked if they could
light a fire and cook their dinner, but the old
party was obdurate, and refused to allow them
even that privilege. Then high words ensued, but
eventually the cruisers went abroad, and hoisted
their sails for a better market. T n the meantime,
however, the Lane Cove man went to the nearest
telegraph station and wired to the police authori-
ties in Sydney for a battery of field guns and
some cavalry and infantry, to capture two French
escapes who, he said, were cruising round, intent
on rapine and plunder, and had some infernal
machines with them, which were evidently in-
tended for the destruction of all the public build-
ings in Lane Cove. Thereupon a mounted trooper
was sent from Sydney so reconnoitre, and the
standing army of the colony was held in readiness
to go to war on receipt of information as to the
location of the enemy. By that time the pirates,
having disposed of their cargo, had taken advant-
age of a fair wind and ebb tide to return to the
depot, and so got away clear. However, such a
scare has been created in that neighbourhood that
a whole consignment of bolts and bars have been
shipped there, as well as a number of horse pistols
to guard the inhabitants from the depradations of
the French escapes. And all this because one of
those harmless agents had a French accent.
Catch on to this, Dr. Barry. It is a some-
what remarkable fact that although we, Christians,
profess to believe that God alone knows what is
for our advantage, and what is not, still we gener-
ally specify what we want when we pray, in a style
so exact, as to lead an unbeliever to suppose that
our Deity was a sort of Hebrew general store-
keeper who would ring a shoddy article on us
whenever an opportunity offered. One Pope—
who was a sort of poet in his own small way- once
song a little song like this:
“ Unask’d, what good thou kuowest, grant,
What ill, though ask’d, deny.”
And even the mule-headed old pagans who used to
bribe their gods with fried cow-heel and bullock’s
livers had a higher opinion of the Omnipotent
than we seem to hold, for their principal prayer
was, “Father Jove, grant us good, whether we
pray for it or not; and avert from us all evil, even
though we pray far It.” And this leads us up to
the following tale;—Some months ago, the Queen
of Italy was out for a run when she unexpectedly
came across a little girl named Anita Cardoni, who
was kneeling down on a log and praying away to
La Regina d’Cielo, fit to burst. On making en-
quiries, Queen Margherita learnt that Anita had
an eye to blz„ and was asking for the modest
sum of four-pence ha’penny to enable her
to buy enough stuff to knit a pair of stockings.
According to the editor of the Roman Lanterna,
the Queen of Italy at once appointed herself as a
sort of advance agent of the Queen of Heaven,
and gave the girl a purse containing sixty lire.
The editor of the Lanterna is probably a lire
himself, and all Margherita handed over was
what the Italians call a sprat; however, Anita
bought the stuff, made the stockings, and sent
them to Her Magesty as a birthday present. Then
the simple-minded little ragazza had another fit of
praying, and she was barely off her knees before a
court messenger returned with the stockings,
which were then full to the bung with glistening
shillings. Now, any man with a healthy imagina-
tion and a sound liver would at once perceive the
finger of Providence sticking out a foot in all
this, but the subsequent proceedings clearly
proved that it would have been better for Anita if
she had prayed for the chicken-pox instead of a
heap of silver. First of all, her old man, who was
Captain of the Free Lunch Brigade, and used to
lie on his back all day in the sun for a living, col-
lared the whole of the royal “ greed,” except a
few pieces that his eldest boy, Giovanni Baptista,
stole, and then went off on a howling Jamberoo
around the city. Then the trouble began.
First of all, Giovanni Baptista Invested his
pile in an old horse-pistol and ammunition
with which he accidentally blew the roof off
Anita’s head, and filled the Southern hemisphere
of a monk’s pants with buck-shot. About the
eleventh hour, the old man (whose front name was
Pietro) began to make the city lively, and before
the fifteenth hour was chimed, it was rumoured
that Antichrist had broken loose, and was raising
Cain throughout the district. Then the “ foorce ”
was called out, and after a pitched battle
was fought, Pietro was “run in.” Next day
he was hauled along before a pot-bellied old
magistrate, and charged with drunkenness, dis-
orderly conduct, profane and seditious lan-
guage,, painting the statues of s.S. Pietro et
Paulo pea-green, and chalking filthy inscriptions
all over the walls of the Colosseum, shooting at
fourteen priests and the editor of the Lanterna,
setting lire to the Government powder magazine,
and blowlncr up a public school with dynamite,
hamstringing the Pope’s horses, burning down the
hospital, and about 17,000 other minor charges,
which the prosecuting sergeant said he didn t
wish to press. Anita doesn’t pray at all. now. It
takes her all her time to hold her scalp on with
one hand, and carry the old man’s grub to the gaol
with the other. And we're thankful we were
badly brought up ourselves, and don’t even know
what prayer is.
The idea that Her Majesty's Government
can be composed of English gentlemen not habi-
tually addicted to murder, arson, piracy, forgery,
robbery, and perjury, oan only be entertained by
people who have not read the recent speeches
of the Marquis of Salisbury, Lord Randolph
Churchill, and the leading members of her
Majesty’s Opposition. After reading these opposi-
tion fulminations, one is apt (says Daqonet) to
fancy that one has been asleep for a year, and that
in the meantime the Cabinet has been reeon-
structed somewhat as follows

Iscariot.

Maziere Brady, in his “ Plea for an A,nglo-
Roman Alliance,” says:—“The Queen paid two
short visits to her Irish dominions, and never
spent a single Sunday upon Irish terra firma. On
the occasion of her last visit, she went on board
her yacht on a Saturday night, and steamed out of
Kingstown harbour on the following morning.
She never once entered a Catholic place of worship
in Ireland. Yet when on the Continent of Europe
she has been known to witness functions in
Catholic churches. Her sons have visited St.
Peter’s and the Pope, and given their photographs
in token of friendship, to Irish Catholic ecclesi-
astics in Rome. The Queen, when in Scotland 1
attends Presbyterian worship, and receives com-
munion in a sitting posture. Her representatives
in India pay respect to the idolatrous religions
of the natives, and her troops in Egypt did
homage to the Holy Carpet. Her Majesty would
have set a striking example of tolerance to
her Protestant subjects, and would have
gained the hearts of many of her Catholic
lieges, had she attended High Mass or a Te
Deum in the Dublin Catholic Cathedral. There
are millions of Irish Catholics in Great Bri-
tian and her colonies, and there are also no incon-
siderable number of British Catholics in the same
regions. In America the Catholics of Irish descent
are so numerous as to constitute a formidable
power in the United States, a power whose in-
fluence no political party can afford to despise. All
these millions of Catholics, are spiritually subject
to the Pope. The spiritual master of these
millions is a potentate whose aid cannot safely be
despised by! the temporal sovereign. At present
the autocrat of all the Busslas finds it necessary to
establish diplomatic relations with Rome; and the
Protestant Emperor of Germany is not ashamed to
go to Canossa, and send an accredited agent to the
Vatican, why does Great Britain refuse to send a
duly authorised envoy to the Papal Court? It
may be confidently asserted that the principal
leaders of political parties in England, whether
Conservative or Liberal, entertain for themselves
no objection against establishing regular diploma-
tic relations with a Court with which they have been
from time to time, if not continuously, compelled
to treat indirectly. Years ago, the Papal Nuncio
at Paris or Brussels was the occasional interme-
diary between Rome and St. James’. Sometimes a
Protestant prelate, such as the notorious Bari of
Bristol, conveyed the wishes of the British Cabinet
to the Propaganda. Hundreds of letters of Sir J.
Coxe Hippesley, an officious but unofficial envoy
of the British Crown, lie In Roman archives.
Cardinal Erskine was also employed in an under-
hand manner at the Vatican; among the more or
less official and officious agents at Rome were one
Jenkins, an antiquary, Lord fastlereagh, Mr.
Petre, the Earl of Minto, who threatened the Pope
with the British fleet. Lord Lyons. Mr. Odo Russell,
and Mr. Clarke Jervoise; and, in short, there never
was a period when the British Government omitted
to seek the Pope’s aid through irregular channels,
whenever that aid seemed to be desirable. Even
in more recent times no Papal appointments to
important episcopal sees in Ireland were made
without attempts, more or less indirect, on the
part of English agents or quasi-agents to influence
them. The mission of Mr. George Errington, so
long denied, was at last acknowledged. Those
British statesmen, theretore, who say that a British
envoy at the Papal Court is unnecessary, while
they themselves employ one, are guilty of hypo-
crisy. Most persons, however, are of opinion that
if diplomatic intercourse of some kind with Rome
be necessary, such intercourse should be open and
above-board. The Conservative Premiers are only
deterred by fear of the Orangemen, and the Liberal
Premiers by fear of the extreme Radicals, from
taking the honourable course of openly establish-
ing those diplomatic relations with Rome which
they know by experience to be absolutely indis-
pensable.

AYER’S
Cherry Pectoral.
No other complaints are so insidious in their
attack as those affecting the throat and lungs*
none so trifled with by the majority of suffer-
ers. The ordinary cough or cold, resulting
perhaps from a trifling or unconscious ex-
posure, is often but the beginning of a fataV
sickness. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral has
well proven its efficacy in a forty years’ light
with throat and lung diseases, and should be
taken in all cases without delay.
A Terrible Cough Cured.
“ In 18571 took a severe cold, which affected
my lungs. I had a terrible cough, and passed
night after night without sleep. The doctors
gave me up. I tried Ayer’s Cherry Pec-
toral, which relieved my lungs, induced
sleep, and afforded me the rest necessary
for the recovery of my strength. By the
continued use of the Pectoral a perma-
nent cure was effected. I am now 62 years
old, hale and hearty, and am satisfied your
Cherry Pectoral saved me.
Horace Fairbrothee.”
Rockingham, Vt., July 15,1882.
* Croup.—A Mother’s Tribute.
“While in the country last winter my little
boy, three years old, was taken ill with croup;
it seemed as if he would die from strangu-
lation. One of the family suggested the use
of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, a bottle of
which was always kept in the house. This
was tried in small and frequent doses, and
to our delight in less than half an hour the
little patient was breathing easily. The doc-
tor said that the Cherry Pectoral had
saved my darling’s life. Can you wonder at
our gratitude ? Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Emma Gedney.”
159 West 128th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
“ I have used Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral
in my family for several years, and do not
hesitate to pronounce it the most effectual
remedy for coughs and colds we have ever
tried. A. J. Crane.”
Lake Crystal, Minn., March 13, 1882.
“ I suffered for eight years from Bronchitis,
and after trying many remedies with no suc-
cess, I was cured by the use of Ayer’s Cher-
ry Pectoral. Joseph Walden.”
Byhalia, Miss., April 5,1882.
“ I cannot say enough in praise of Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral, believing as I do that
but for its use I should long since have died
from lung troubles. E. Bragdon.”
Palestine, Texas, April 22, 1882.
No case of an affection of the throat or
lungs exists which cannot be greatly relieved
by the use of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral,
and it will always cure when the disease is
not already beyond the control of medicine.

results;
_ , „ of age,
wish to' tell you. she retired one night
aoou J f 0ur months ago in her usual good health,
out t jj e ne xt morning she could not speak. My
w .fe took her to Invereil to see Dr. , who said
r uer throat was ulcerated low down, aud he pre-
scribed cod liver oil and other medicines; and also
advised her to inhale the fumes of Stockholm tar,
saying she might never recover her speech again.
At the expiration of a fortnight, the medicine
having been finished, another visit to the Dr. was
made, who again prescribed for her, but told my
wife he had no hope of her ever being able to
speak again. We began to despair, but the day I
used the oil—about three months after she was*
taken ill—I persuaded my wife, after we had
retired, to use the oil. She got up and
gave the girl two drops in water, and rubbed
it on her throat. Next morning we were'
delighted to find that she could talk as well as ever,
and has been able to do so ever since.

The Burrow a Times referring to the
suspension of the local branch of the Oriental Bank
saysStatements and reports of large amounts
having been deposited on Saturday were freely
made. In short, people who were never before
supposed to be troubled with a plethora of cash,
were credited with having locked up in the strong-
room of the neat little Oriontial Bank buildings in
Brial-street immense sums of money. It is only
when a financial crisis like the present occurs that
the names of large depositors leak out.” Quite so.
There are a good score of fellows whom we could
name, an’ we were so disposed, who mean furnish-
ing, simply on the strength of the Oriental’s mishap.
Cunning little darling, indeed, is Henrietta
151tie Sturgess, who toed the scratch at the
* Central,” Melbourne, on Tuesday last, on a
charge of having gallantly attempted to support
two husbands at the same time. Before the trial
was called, the knowing Ettie made herself ac-
quainted with the domestic relations of the jury-
men likely to be rounded up to sit on her, and
then, when the proper time arrived, she challenged
nearly every man who she thought was married,
and thereby furnished herself with a boxful of
sympathetic, blushing bachelors. The result
proved that the fair enslaver wasn’t very far
wrong in her estimate of that portion of the
human race which wears pants outside its clothes,
and has an artist’s eye for a well turned foot and
ankle, for, although the charge was sheeted home
to the very much married Mrs. Sturgess, she got
the benefit of a rather|slim sort of doubt, and was
let off with a short three month’s seclusion; Judge
Holroyd at the same time ordering thatshe should
be kept apart from the other prisoners. Now let
us warble the 77th hymn, “ Oh, it is love, ’tis love,
that damns the wor-ruld all round,”—long metre.
Shortly after the recent farcial trial of
Berber, the Cincinnati murderer, it was rumoured
round that he had managed to ‘‘get at” the jury.
Immediately on hearing* this, a deputation con-
Bisting of something like 3000 infuriated citizens,
armed with axes, daggers, clubs, and shot-guns,
endeavoured to get at the same jury also, but the
gentlemen required, having found , the climate was
getting unhealthy, packed up their traps and
skipped the district. Being disappointed m this
particular part of their praiseworthy programme,
the deputation then went for Berber in a style,
compared with which the massacre of 1st. Bartho-
lomew’s night was “never in it,” and it was only
after being half dragged tojdeath and subjected to
other annoyances that Mr. Berber managed to
keep his head on. These frivolous proceedings on
the part of the frisky deputation have given
general dissatisfaction to the respectable portion
of the community of Cincinnati, because, as it is
justly argued, if a jury cannot positively guarantee
that their verdict will protect a murderer from all
future risks and trouble, what prisoner will be ass
enough to pay for their services? The sacred
majesty of the law must be upheld at any cost,
and the rights and perquisites of jurymen must be
respected also. All this, of course, applies to Cin-
cinnati only.
Make a note of this lot. Speaking, re-
cently, in the House of Lords, the Earl of Carnar-
von “contended that nothing short of immigra-
tion would mitigate the evils suffered by the
population in the east of London, where the people
were, in many cases, paid low wages, or earned no
wages at all. While the population was increas-
ing, and the evils from it increasing in London,
people were wanted, and good wages were being
paid in the British colonies.” That’s the idea. Ail
the Earl of Carnarvon wants is a leaky, badiy-
found ship, and free communication between the
saloon passengers and the single women, to be a
whole immigration service in himself. The noble
Earl sends ship-loads of unfortunates out to Syd-
ney, our noble Premier sends them up the country,
and so they get passed along until they reach the
bounds of beggary. Immigrants are wanted here,
but they must be madect sterner stuff than the
miserable paupers from the slums of East London.
Men, broad-chested, oak-limbed men, who can
catch on to a shovel and sling sand like a wild bull
going to war, are the style of hairpins wo want at
this end of the globe to-day, and not a nation com-
posed of barber s clerks and piano punchers, who
faint at the sight of a pick, and who know no more
about country life than a Madagascar monkey
does about the Ten Commandments. Keep your
refuse, Mr. Carnarvon, and give us reasonable
time and we’ll make our own colonists.
The Honeymoon, is the sweet, sugar-
candyish title of a new journal which has just
appeared In Brussels. The editor announces that
he has secured the co-operation of a doctor of
law, and of an experienced genealogist. The busi-
ness of this latter functionary will be to find illus-
trious ancestors for those ladies who love to tell
their acquaintances how many milk-white horses
used to draw their grandfather’s “ kerndge, and
for such gentlemen as take a pleasure in lying
about what their ancestors did during the un-
healthy days of the Norman conquest. Talking
about this reminds us that a certain continental gen-
tleman, holding a high Government office, was fool
isb enough to solicit the aid of a matrimonial
agency company to help him to a wealthy wife, and
ibis was agreed to, providing the gentleman con-
fided to the directors the history of his earlier
years. This he did, and in the course of his con-
fession, owned up to several rather shady mone-
tary transations, and to being the father of two
living “love” children also. Matters were satis-
factorily arranged, however, and the suitor was
soon married to a most accomplished and
beautiful young lady. Almost immediately
afterwards, however, the husband found himself
perpetually annoyed with letters from the directors
of the agency, the object of these being to extort
money from him. He was carefully informed that
if he did not forthwith plank down ten thousand
francs, certain disclosures would be made to his
wife that would cause that cruelly-deceived young
woman to smash furniture and drag the very hair
out of the innocent plaster on her bedroom walls
with rage. Contrary to expectation, this only got
the gentleman's back up, and he not only bucked
against the demand, but he actually brought sn
action against the company, and had the satisfac-
tion of getting the enterprising directors boosted
up for seven years. That s where tbe prudent hus-
band had the bulge on the smart directors. Before
these gentlemen retired from the giddy whirj, how-
ever, they placed the newly-made bride in full
possession of all the particulars connected with
her lord and master’s early life, the result being
that she has just succeeded in getting a first-class
divorce. And that’s where the short-haired direc-
tors have tbe laugh at the prudent husband.
Cattle branding, as a line art, is now one
of the most popular studies amongst the counter-
skippers of a certain brisk little mining town
down South’ard. It appears that in the town re-
ferred to, the leading storekeepers favour their
employes with a half-holiday every Thursday; and
the shutters are barely up, before the linen-grocers,
sugar-measurers, &e., are scooting away to a
neighbouring cattle station in order to get initiated
into the Eleusinian mysteries of the stockyard.
The modus operandi in the branding business is
carried on as follows : The most verdant artist in
the crowd is told off to hold the other bull-calf by
the horns; the next man grabs the tail, four others
hang on to a leg each, half-a-dozen more keep up
the fire, and when all is ready, the captain of the
gang seizes his weapon, takes a run of 50 yards,
and dabs the red-hot iron on the first section of
the calf he comes to. This is fun for the company
on the fence. Simultaneously wuh the arrival of
the branding iron, however, the infuriated calf
takes the joker in the rear such an enthusiastic
kick in the stomach, that the astonished young
petticoat-peddler at once severs all connection
with the animal’s tail, and shoots over the fence
to see how the crops are looking in the next dis-
trict. By this time, the rest of the artists are mak-
ing for the gate at a pace that would burst Malone
all to pieces before he could cover twenty yards;
but the sugar adulterator in front, being gener-
ally a new hand, holds on to the bull-calf 's horns
and yells out “Fire! Murder! Bigamy! Arson !
Obtaining goods under false pretences!” and every
other crime in the Newgate Calendar. This is
where the fun for the bull comes in. First of all,
he throws his head violently backwards, until he
brings the butt of his tail and the dried-apple dis-
tributor’s heels on a level; another tremendous
jerk spills Mr. What-can-I-do-for-you-next-raadam
into the middle of the yard, and then the calf
Eokes his horns through the Southern Ocean of
is victim’s pants, and proceeds to dust the fences
with him in such a business like manner that in
ten seconds’ time the unfortunate grocer is as
destitute of breeches as the unborn babe of a
Highland gillie. Even the maker’s name is lost,
and by the time the bull is called off, the miserable
young salt-fish merchant looks like a man who had t
called a threshing-machine a condemned liar. An j
adjournment is then made to the stock-owner’s
mansion, where a sumptuous banquet is ready, I
and all hands sit round the festive board, and
laugh and joke over the afternoon’s amusement.
All except the young man who had hold of the
calf’s horns. He generally stands outside, and
resolves himself into a select committee to ascer-
tain which part of his body requires the most
rubbing.
At a banquet given in his honour, Earl
Shaftsbury is reported to have said, referring to
the “Bitter Cry,” that it was ail a mistake to
speak of “Outcast London.” Every home, every
nook and corner, he said, had been enquired into
long before the present agitation began. His
Lordship referred to the state of London as he
knew it, more than fifty years ago, and declared
that between now and then the difference was
immense. “No one but those who could look
back could have any conception of the filthy
courts, dens, and alleys, which are now swept i
away—their very names being forgotten.” Ex-
actly so, and it is this very action of sweeping j
away the dwellings of the poor which adds to their
misery, and crowds whole families into single i
rooms in the remaining districts. The enquiry
into every nook and corner which his Lordship i
refers to, was made principally by tract distribu-
tors, whose sole idea of doing good consists in i
“saving souls.” How, we ask. can people who |
believe in hell be expected to care for mere phy-
sical suffering ? Hunger, dirt, disease, starvation, |
cold, are mere trifles in their estimation, and not
to be considered worthy of senous thought. A loaf
of bread might save a starving family, but that
would cost money, and, after all, only save the
body ; a tract, however, costs next to nothing, and
rich people are willing to furnish an unlimited
supply of printed matter for the saving of souls.
Earl Shaftsbury’s enquiring friends have been
exceedingly liberal in the matter of tracts. They
visit a hovel where some miserable wretches are
dying of starvation, and leave a tract, and think
they have acted charitably and done good service.
For the benefit of people like this, we will trans-
late some verses of the Gospel of St. Matthew into
the language with which we are familiar at the
present day “ Many will say to me Lord, Lord,
have we not preached the Gospel in Thy name ?
Have we not distributed tracts in Thy name ? And
in Thy name sent missionaries to the heathen, and
done many other wonderful works ? And then
will I profess unto them I never knew you ; de-
part from me, ye that work Iniquity. . . Then
shall they also answer Him saying Lord, when saw
we Thee hungry, thirsty, cold, clothed in rags, and
did not help Thee? Then shall He answer them
saying. Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the
least of these friends of mine when they were in
that condition, and ye had plenty of money, and
could easily have helped them, ye did it not to
Me.” When the great roll-call of the world comes,
we are pretty sure that sermons, psalm singing,
tract distributing, &c., will draw very lightjy on
the Heavenly treasury, and that the honest, kindly
heart of the poor humanitarian, be he Pagan or
Christian, who helps to lift the load from the
shoulders of a poor neighbour will have earned a
bigger cheque han all the paraphernalia and sham
philanthropy of Exeter Hall.
For grim humour we doubt if Michael
M’Gilvery and Job Lavarty have any rivals this
side of the equinoctial line. One night last week,
Sub-Inspector Hyam did a prowl round the Do-
main at that silent hour when churchyards yawn,
and their ghostly tenants polka out in their
shrouds to catch a mouthful of fresh air and get
up Tambaroora pools to decide whose gravestone
inscription contains the greatest number of plain,
undiluted lies to the square inch. Why did Sub-
Inspector Hyam leave his virtuous, rose-leaved
couch at that sad and sloppy hour? Was it to
gather figs from thistles, or to seek inspiration
; rom the reeking sewers in order to enable him to
sling love songs for the back end page of the
Evenin’ Snooze? Devil a bit of it. He simply
(to use the melodious language of Woolloomooloo)
went round to see how th’ employed were “ dish-
in’” and “dossed,” and how it felt to feel to be
compelled to drink rain-water-soup and eat grass
like a cow or Nebuchadnezzar, The first able-
bodied son of toil the good Sub-Inspector struck
was so thin that it took him half an hour to find
out what part of his ragged attire the poor devil
lived in, and Sergeant Pirie coming past at the
time was instructed to tie him up to a fence and
put bricks in his boots to keep him from being
blown out to sea and cheating the city corpner ot
a fiver. He was 73 years of age, and with the
exception of a speckled banana and tne sight of
a board with “good meals, 6d,” chalked on it,
ho hadn’t had a particle of nourishment lor fly e
days. He was told to put his trust in Provide nce
and the Dimycratie Association, and then the
“ foorce ” moved on till they came to the ca T mp of
Messrs. M’Gilvery and Lavarty. This worthy p*ir
was found under the friendly shelter of OGe of th9
Domain seats, and on being roused up, Mr. Job
Lavarty said It was an infernal shame to shake a
man out of his sleep j ist as he was dreaming that
he was saucing the girls at the Coffee Palace for
bringing him rissoles with tomato sauce, instead
of veal cutlets A la Cardinal Richelieu. Job de-
clared that if he hadn’t been fortunate enough to
have found a couple of 'eaves of an old cookery
book, he must have died of starvation at 39 mi-
nutes past 1, on the 1st of May, and that even now
he felt so weak that he believed a fair kick from
a brewer’s horse would knock him down. He was
advised to keep away from such spasmodic cattle,
and then Mr. Gilvery was asked if the rain, which
had been falling heavily, did not slightly incon-
venience himself and his partner. “Not in the
lastho,” replied the festive Michael; “ y’ see, mean’
Job f orninst there hez a Sydney Morning Herald
a piece on top av’ us, an’ be th’ howly St. Patnric r
the contints av’ them papers id keep us dhry if we
wuz on th’roof of owld Noah’s Ark at th’ toime
av’the Diluge.” Then the officers knew he wai
prevaricating by speaking the truth, and so they
went on their way rejoicing.
He was a high-toned delegate from one of
1 the sister colonies, and, his official business being
1 ended, he went on a tear, and made things
lively round the district. She said her husband
was a plougher of the sea, and, now that the dele-
gate mentioned it, she thought it was rather
dangerous for a lovely young woman like her to
live by herself in such a lonely spot as the skirts of
Carlton. This conversation happened on a Tues-
day. The bloodyjbattle of Tel-el-Kebir had been
fought and won ; fierce threats of Nihilistic ven-
geance shook the Russian throne, Java lay in
ruins, and sheep’s-trotters were sold at a penny
each in the sti tots of Melbourne. Why we mer«
tion trotters is because the lauy above referred to
was bringing home a dozen for her supper on the
night in question. By this time, the delegate was
so ’smitten by her charms, and so touched by her
defenceless position, that he offered to escort her
home and remain there until the prospect looked
more cheerful. The lady dieaded this, however
because she knew not the day, nor the hour, her
husband would return. The delegate calmed her
fears ; bull-dog beer and divers other things sup-
plemented the trotters when they reached home, a
ilgh old time was held, and then the loving pair
kissed “good night,” and retired to roost.
The delegate was longest saying his prayers,
and was standing divested of everything save his
shirt, and socks, and trousers, when the lady called
out from her room to his that it would be a prudent
thing to slio quickly out and lock the front gate,
so that, if her husband should come home, our
delegate hero would have time to retreat unosten-
tatiously over the back fence. This seemed to be
such a sensible thought that the delegate slipped t
out at once; and, having leturned, he was greatly
surprised to find that the front door had beeni
carefully locked upon him. On throwing pebbles >
at the lady’s window to attract attention, how-
ever, he was still more surprised to find a bullet-
headed man poking his head out of another window
and angrily demanding to be informed “ Who the 1
devil was down there ?’’ No one, of course, couldi
possibly describe the delegate’s feelings then, be-
cause he remembered that it was a cold night, andi
he had forgotten to take a valuable gold watch
and £75 in cash with him when he skipped off good-
naturedly to bar the gate; but every active mind
can conceive the grotesqueness of a stout, middle-
aged party, clad in the scanty habiliments of a pair
of trousers, frilled shirt, and scar'et socks, stand-
ing out in the road at 2 a.m., and endeavouring to
persuade incredulous cabmen that he was a gentle-
man in disguise, and if they’d only drive him to
one of the leading city hotels, the obliging Jehu
would be amply rewarded then, and in course of
time get a billet as night policeman. About 5a.m.
one cabby said he’d chance it.’and the delegate went
home next day, a poorer, if not a wiser, man.
The Shun Pao (Chinese journal published
at Shanghai) thus reports the battle of Sontay (as
will be observed, the account varies considerably
from that given by the French)“ The Chines©
General Lau, had previously prepared mines, con-
taining gunpowder and stupifying drugs, in his
encampment On the arrival uf the French troops,
the Chinese, feigning defeat, retired, surrendering
three of their camps to the French, who at once
took postession. Thereupon the Chinese fired
their rockets into the mines, which at once ex-,
ploded with a noise as of underground thunder
the French troops being blown to atoms, (literal! ’
killed and cooked.) The Chinese troops who w
placed in ambush, at once rushed out and ut cer i v
destroy ed the French soldiers. The third b»' italic h
of the French army auvaneca to toe «ssis* ' e of
their comrades, but were annihilated h „ ~ eneral
