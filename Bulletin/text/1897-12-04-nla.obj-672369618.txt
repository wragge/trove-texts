THE MED PAGE.
ROBERT BURNS.
He felt scant need
Of church or creed.
He took small share
In saintly prayer,
His eyes found food for his love •
He could pity poor devils condemned to hell
But sadly neglected endeavours to dwell
With the angels in luck above : •
To save one’s precious peculiar soul
He never could understand is the whole
Of a mortal’s business in life,
While all about him his human kin
With loving and hating and virtue and sin
Reel overmatched in the strife.
“The heavens for the heavens and the earth for the earth 1
I am a man—l’ll be true to my birth—
Man in my joy*—in my pain*.’’
So fearless, stalwart, erect and tree.
He gave to bis fellows right royally
His strength, his heart, his brains ;
For proud and fiery and swift and bold—
Wine of life from heart of gold,
The blood of hi* heathen manhood rolled
Full-billowed through his veins.
James Thomson.
THE just-arrived fourth volume of Henley and
Henderson’s ‘ Burns ’ completes this best of
all editions of the poet. The contents include 57
pieces attributed to Burns, of which 14 are pro-
bably not his, four are vamped, and 39 wholly
belong to him. None of these is of first-rate
merit; and most have no merit at all. There is
added a lengthy essay by W. E. Henley on
Burns’s life, genius, and achievement—the best
estimate of Burns as man and poet yet printed.
They :ay Henley has been out of health lately,
and the essay seems to want something of his
normal force—the words do not give out tht->r
message as lucidly and vividly as they ought.
There are many flashes of suggestion, but nothing
particularly inspiring or illuminating to those
who have already used Henley’s material to
reach Henley’s conclusions. Yet one can
conceive the horror of the foolish people who have
transformed Burns into a sort of Scottish Mumbo-
Jumbo, ‘a formidable rival to the Almighty
* that oheap decorous chromo - lithograph (as it
were) whioh bids fair to supplant the true Burns
—ardent, impulsive, generous; but hypochon-
driacal, passionate, imperfect—in the minds of his
oountrymen.’
Kegarding the songs of Burns, Henley oan do little more than repeat his former statement—
. . . h;3 work for the Museum consisted largely in the adaptation of old rhymes and folk-songs to modem
tries. Some ho arranged, some ho oondensed, some he enlarged, some ho reconstructed and rewrote. Stray
snatches, phrases, lines, thin echoes from a vanished past—nothing came amiss to him, nor was there any-
thing he could not turn to good account. Hi* appreciation was instant anti inevitable, hi* touch unerring.
Under his hand a patch-work of catch-words Decame a living song. He would take you two frag-
ments of different epochs, seleot the best from each, and treat the matter of his choice in such
a *tyle that it is hard to know where its components end and begin: so that nothing is oertain
about his result except that here is a piece of ark Or he would capture a wandering old refrain, adjust it to
bis own conditions, and bo renew its lyrical interest and and significance that it seems to live its true life for the
first time on his lips. Here, in fnot, iB his chief claim to perennial acceptance. He passed the folk-song of his
nation through the mint of his mind, and he reproduced it stamped with his image and lettered with his super-
scription : so that for the world at large it exists, and will go on existing, not as he found out as he left it. . . .
But a hundred forgotten singers went to the making of his achievement and himself. He did not wholly
originate those master-qualities—of fresh and taking simplicity, of vigour and directnr-ss and happy and humorous
ease, which have come to be regarded as distinctive of his verse ; for all those things, together with much of the
thought, the romance, and the sentiment for which we read and love him, were included in the estate which he
inherited from his nameless forebears ; and he so assimilated them that what is actually those forebears legacy to him
has come to be regarded as his gift to them. Those forebears aiding, he stands forth as the sole great poet of the old
Soots’ world . . .
This statement errs in favor of Burns, doubtless for the reason previously given—that it is hardly
Sjssible for any British critic to wholly rid himself of the Burns tradition, of the accumulated
urnB tnana. Burns’s touch was by no means unerring, as Henley’s essay admits. And, as Henley
also admits, that ‘ Burns lives so intense a lyric life is largely due to the fact that he took to himself,
and made his own, the lyrioal experience, the lyrical longing, the lyrical invention, the lyrical
possibilities of many nameless singers. . . . Again and again his forefathers find him in lyrical ideas,
in whose absence there must certainly—there cannot but have been—a blank in his woik.’ If, under
these circumstances, Burns was ‘ the sole great poet ’ of the old Scots world, it is evident that the
normal idea of a poet will need readjustment. What precise measure of credit attaches to the
unoriginal poetic artificer who borrows nearly all the best of hi* best work from his predecessors?
• • • •
It must be remembered that Burns himself, though he oertainly was not over-squeamish re-
garding his plagiarisms—as when he palmed off ‘ Behold the Hour ’on Clarinda as his own—
never claimed credit for many of the verses which his eulogists attribute to him. If he did, he
might have claimed credit for a Clean-Steal like ‘The Dusty Miller.’
THE DUSTY MILLER.
(At he appears in editions of Burns.)
Hey the dusty miller
And his dusty ooat 1
He will spend a shilling
Or he win a groat.
Dusty was the coat,
Dusty was the oolor.
Dusty was the kiss
That I gat frae the miller I
Hey the dusty miller
And his dusty saokl
Leeze me on the calling
Fills the dusty peck 1
Fills the dusty peck,
Brings the dusty siller I
I wad gie my coatie
For the dusty miller!
THE DUSTY MILLER.
{Am he appears in the Herd MS. whence Burns filched
h*m.)
O, the Duaty Miller, O the Dusty Hiller 1
Dusty was hi* coat, Dusty was his cullour.
Dusty was the kiss I got frae the Miller I
O, the Dusty Miller with the dusty coat.
He will spend a shilling ere he win a groat—
O, the Dusty Miller.
And ‘The Dusty Miller’ passes with thousands of devout Burns-worshipners as hi* genuine pro-
duct—an egg of genius that only his mind could lay ! In the ane Clean Steal category are ‘The
Primrose ’ (ravished from Thomas Carew—Burns himself calls it an ‘old English song, wi boh I dare
say is but little known’—wherefore he ravished); ‘Bonie Dundee’; ‘Whistle an’ I’ll Come to You,
my Lad ’; * Landlady, Count the Lawin ’ ; ‘Laddie, Lie Near Me ’ ; ‘ We’re a’ Noddin ’ ; and some
two-score more. In these cases, if Burns has not forcibly annexed the whole of his originals, he has
annexed so much of idea, phrase, and rhyfchmua that the song would be nothing without them.
* * * *
The Clean-Steal class slides imperceptibly into the Neat-Vamp class, in whioh Burns contributes
so much to the construction that the product it practically a new song. An example is ‘A Red,
Red Rose ’ —
A RED, RED ROSE.
(A* it appears in editions of Burns.)
O, my luve is like a red, red rose,
That’s newly sprung in June.
O, nty luve is like the meWlie,
That’s sweetly play’d in tune.
As fair art thou, my bonie lass,
So deep in luve am I,
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till a’ the seas gang dry.
Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi’ the sun.
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
While the sands o’ life shall run.
A RED, RED ROSE.
As the first verse appears in a blackletter ballad, ‘The
Wanton Wijt of Castle Gate.’
Her cheek* are like the roses
That blossom fresh in June,
O, she’s like a new-strung instrument
That’* newly pi.tin tune.
And as the other verses appear in various ante-Burns
ballads- viz., in ‘ The Young Man's Farewell to His
Love.’
The seas they shall run dry,
And rocks melt into sands;
Then I’ll love you still, my dear,
’ When all these things are done. . ,
Fare you well, my own true love,
And fare you well for a •vhile,
And I will be sure to return hack again,
If I go ten thousand mile.
And fare thee weel, nr; only luve.
And fare thee weel a while 1
And I will come again, ray luve,
Tho’ it were ten thouaand mile 1
And in ‘ The. Loyal Lover s Farewell.'
The Day shall turn to Night, dear Love,
And the Rocks melt with the Sun,
Before that I prove false to thee,
Before my life be gone, dear Love,
Before my Life be gone.
And in similar ballads, for which see nol. Hi., p. 1,03, of
Henley <k Henderson's 'Burns.’
In this class come many of the songs by which Burns is best known and loved—some 108 in all.
Inoluded are ‘The Birks of Aberfeldie,’ ‘M'Pherson’s Farewell,’ ‘lt was a’ for Our Rightful King,'
‘The Silver Tassie,’ ‘ John Anderson my .Jo,’‘o Were my Love’ (first verse Burns, second and
best old), and many others. Sometimes Burns took only an old chorus or an old fragment em-
bodying an idea to build his song on ; but Henley justly says that ‘ anyone who has tried to write a
song will agree . . . that a lyrical idea—by whioh I mean a rhythm, a burden, and a drift—
once found, the song wiites itself. It writes itself easily or with difficulty, it writes itself well or ill,
but in the end it writes itself.’
* • * •
In the Neat-Vamp class of Burns’s, songs the Derivative class merges. Just where one class
begins and the other ends is a matter for individual taste to determine. An example of the Derived
Bong is ‘ Auld Lang Syne ’ —
AULD LANG SYNE.
The chorus, as attributed to Burnt.
For auid lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne,
Well tak’ a cup o’ kindness yet
For auld lang syne !
The first verse.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind ?
Should auld acquaintanoe be forgot.
And auld lang syneT
OLD LONG SYNE.
The chorut, as it appears in an old ballad of iht
same name.
On old long syne,
On old long syne, my jo.
On old long syne:
That thou canst never onoe reflect'
On old long syne.
And the first verse of the old ballad -
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
.And never thought upon.
The Flames of Love extinguished
And freely past and gone?
Is thy kind Heart now grown so oold
In that Loving Breast of thine,
That thou can’st never once reflect
On Old-long-syne ?
Ths writer’s classification of the whole body of Burns’s songs goes thus —
Burns’s Very-Own (as far as known), for which he take* 100 per cent, of what credit there is (and these in-
clude all the numerous worthless item* gathered by editors’ devotion).. .. .. .. 151 song*
Clean-Steal*, for which Burn* takes oto 25 percent, of credit .. .. .. .. 60 „
Neat-Vamps and Derivatives, for whioh Burns takes from 25 to 75 par cent, of credit 108 „
Total .. .. .. .. .. •• •• •• 809 songs
Probably every reader would alter this classification a little —one man’s indignation may tempt him
to call a Clean-Steal the song which another admires as a Neat-Vamp; but the proportion approxi-
mately stands till the evidence alters. And Burns takes credit for all the songs for whioh no originals
are known, including some which it is morally certain are Neat-Vamps. As already pi inted out, some
of his originals have almost certainly been lost : some have been destroyed by his jealous friends and
relatives; and some, probably, have escaped the perspiring editors’ search. But after me has
diligently sifted wheat from chaff all through Henley’s fat third volume, the typical Very-Own song
stands out distinctly from the typical Clean-Steal or Neat-Vamp. Examples—
WHERE, BRAVING ANGRY WINTER'S STORMS.
One of Burnt's very own songs.
Where, braving angry winter’s storms.
The lofty Ocliils rise.
Far in their shade my Peggy’s charms
First blest my wondering eyes:
As one who by some savage stream
A Ion; ly gem surveys,
Astonish’d doubly, mark* it beam
With art’s most polish’d blase.
Blest be the wild, sequester’d glade,
And blest the day and hour,
Where Peggy’* charms I first survey’d
When first 1 felt their pow’r!
The tyrant Death with grim conir 1
May seize my fleeting breath,
But tearing Peggy from my soul
Must be a stronger death.
AY W AUK IN, 0.
Shewing tome old balladist's freedom and intensity-
Ay waukin, O,
Waukin still and weary ;
Sleep I can get nane
For thinking on my dearia.
Simmer's a pleasant time:
Flowers of every colour,
The water runs v,wre the heugh.
And I long for my true lover.
When I sleep I dream,
When l wauk I'm eerie,
Sleep I can get nane
For thinkin on my dearie,
Lanely night come* on,

I think on my bonie lad,
And I bleermy een wi’ greetin.
Ay waukin, O,
Wau in still and weary ;
Sleep I can get nane
For thinking on my dearie.
Surely everybody can see the difference between this Burns paste and that Old-Balladist- diamond ?
And the sluggish flow, the flat forth; the empty idea, and the artificial trope tinselling the trite
sentiment—these are all thoroughly characteristic of Burns when he wrote right out of his
own head. The sincerity, the ring, the intensity (either of pathos or humor), the charm and the
power these are always the property of the rough, so-joyous, so-sad old rhymers from whom thesong-
Burns borrowed. Often his sympathy gave their work a better form ; but theirs was the
living fire. The young Burns had fire, too ; the elder Burns had rare flashes of it; but it was not the
divine fire that those earlier Titans stole from Heaven. So again, and assuredly, Biuns’s permanent
reputation must rest on the Kilmarnock volume. That volume, good though it be, stamps him not
the world-genius which his admirers fondly name him, but ‘ the satirist and singer of a parish ;
narrow in range, in language limited (a bonie lass, birks and hawthorn to lie under, and something
drumlie, something green, are about all his sentimental properties); keen in sympathy, but coarse
in fibre; unable to give or receive the most beautiful messages of Beauty; a groundlark, not a
skylark.
* ♦ * *
Yet again, this notice is not intended to exactly show Burns’s place in the poetic firmament,
‘but only to hint how far the true conception of him is removed from the conception which is
legendary and Scottish.’•
ROBERT BURNS.
Around his soul more sternly warred
The powers that smote for Wrong and Right;
And thunder-scathed and battle-scarred.
Death bore him from the fight.
But now we recognise in him
One of the high and shining race;
All gone the mortal mists that dim
The fair immortal face.
The prowling ghoul hath left his grave,
Hushed is the praying Pharisee ;
His frailties fade, his virtues brave
Live everlastingly.
And such a Crown to bind thy brow
Thy glorious Child hath gained for thee,
Thou gray old nurse of Heroes! thou
Proud mother. Poverty!

Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends,
and Patients at his
Electrical & Consulting Eooms,
137 Elizabeth Street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN
DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto oaused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young- Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or exoesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
iOß symptoms, namely:—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, Ac.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps he will send

book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
One Pound is sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
debility,

Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, Do Not Delay,
your case requires advice, and you can either call

reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
Dr. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

In publishing the following remarkable state-
ments, we do so at the special wish of the writers
only ; otherwise secrecy is considered inviolable,

Air. J. H. WEHR, PARMER,
WASLEYS, S.A. writes:—“l can-
not refrain from adding my testi-
monial to your numerous list. In
justice to science, humanity, and
yourselves I must say that your
treatment, of sorrowful afflictions is
past all belief. For seventeen years
I have been a sufferer, and four
months ago I went from bad to
worse ; in fact lost all hope of ever
being- well again. When I visited
you I was at once placed under a
course of treatment, entirely new to
myself, -and from:the first 1 was able to attend to my
occupation as farmer. lam happy to state that lam now
well and better than I have been for years, but shall
follow your advice and take the remedies for some time to
do away with all risk. I shall always remain indebted to
you for my wonderful cure.”
ANTHONY BARRY, Castle Inn,
Hindley-street, Adelaide, writes
“I will be glad if you will publish
the following for the benefit of suf-
ferers. For the last five years I
have been in the West, having'
worked from Lake Darley to the
Horse Shoe Bend in Murchison.
Nearly the whole of the time I have
been a sufferer from Debility,
and loss of energ3', always moping
alone, afraid to loin in any
conversation, noises in the ears, and other symp-
toms too numerous to mentipn ; in fact, was a nuisance
to myself and mates. Tried many advertised remedies
without obtaining any relief. On my way to New Guinea,
and hearing of so many from the West on their way to
other colonies breaking their journey at Adelaide to
obtain your treatment, I depided to do the same. lam
glad to say I now feel fit to continue my journey without
fear, and am sure I have only to take your remedies a
little longer to obtain a thorough cure. lam well known
in all parts of the West, and write this that my mates and
others may know where they can obtain a certain cure.”
Mr. M. J. DENAHY, Beiyl
Street, Broken Hill, writes:—
“ Your remedies have acted
like magic in my case, having
been a sufferer for months
from weakness, and through
weakness I was so ill that I
had to give up work, and I
say truthfully I never thought
I should ever regain my
strength, as I took so much
medicine before seeing you
and without feeling the
slightest bit better, when
fortunately I met a patient of
yours, Mr. J. Kent, who
advised me to lose no time,
and, using his own words, he
said : ‘ The only chance you
have is to go to Brunswick, Hamilton & Co., who will
very soon put you right,’ and I am thankful I took his
advice, for since I took your remedies I am as well and as
strong as ever I was in my life. I oaunot thank you suffi-
cient for what you have done for me.”
REMARKABLE CURE OP DEBILITY.
Mr. J. W. AITCHISON, 22 North-st., Adelaide, writes X
—“Gentlemen, —I cannot refrain from adding my testi-
mony to your extraordinary and most marvellous'’ treat-
ment of one of the worst cases of Debility such as mine
was. Since being under your care I can safely say that I
am a strong man once more, and the distressing symptoms
from what I was suffering from have all disappeared in a
most miraculous manner. I had previously been under
the care of five different practitioners for the past four
years ; purchased three different galvanic or electric belts,
without deriving any benefit whatsoever. I had given up
all hope of ever being myself again, when I was recom-
mended to see you. In two weeks’ time I began to feel
improvement, and your remedies did more for me t.h*n
the whole four years’ treatment with others. I feel as if
I can never thank you enough, and, as I should like other
sufferers to know what you have done for me, make whatr
ever use you like of this.’’
JOSEPH MARTIN, Cen
tral Mine, Broken Hill,
writes : —“ Accept this tes-
timonial in recognition for
the valuable services you
have rendered me by per-
forming a wonderful cure of
my case, which has been on
me for over five years, and
now that I am well and tell
you that I spent over £2OO
before consulting you, and
deriving not a farthing’s
worth of benefit from emin-
ent men makes my case one
that other sufferers should
hear about, so that they can
be treated and cured as I am,
and also made strong,
healthy, and happy, which I never thought could be done
until I was a short time under your care. I could con-
tinue for months writing of the misery and anxiety which
I have suffered, and it makes this testimonial one of great
value, not only to you, but also to those who may be
sufferers like I was, and those that read this and will take
my advice and place their case in your hands will not only
thank you, but also me for making it known to them.

Various Verses .
J.D. : “No plutocratically vamped-up
hysterics over Henry George’s death, and a demo-
cracy that thinks is slow to demonstrate. Hence,
several things. Perhaps George has not been
dead long enough to justify the singing of his
praises as the ablest foe to Fatmanism of this cen-
tury. Yet seldom have a couple of decades pro-
duced such a promising crop, and the harvest
songs will be world songs.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
UNFORGOTTEN.
I.
Death lays his hand on trifles, and they grow
Transfigured at his touch and thrill our hearts
With eloquence no tenderest word imparts,
And utterly break down our time-fenced woe.
A flower she loved, a ballad sweet and low ;
A ribbon she had worn and thrown aside ;
An opened drawer wherein her treasures hide ;
A ring or glove—and the pent tide will flow.
And we are back amid the vanished years.
And see the dear old homestead, and rejoice
To hear again each sweet familiar voice;
And then—in half-unconscious reverie—
We tell our beads on Memory’s rosary,
Counting our losses as the gloaming nears.
11.
We wage a constant but a fruitless war
Against Oblivion, passionately strive
Some cherished household name to keep alive,
As night would fain perpetuate some star
That glorifies it. But we strive in vain !
The headstone record, soon with moss o’ergrown,
Is hidden ’mid long grass, its place scarce known,
And as its imprint fades the memories wane.
We chide our selfish hearts, and put away
The innocent joys that new-create our life,
And summon back the past, with sorrow rife,
Intent to keep reproachful thoughts at bay :
But the sun shines, the woods put forth new leaf,
Fresh roses bloom, Love triumphs over grief.
Vic.
A.V.G.
I TOLD YOU SO.
Gladys, I, the rover,
Have come back to you.
Do you want a lover
To love you long and true?
For my heart a cypress grove
With a love-song echoes yet,
Pride said “ Nay,” but straightway Love
Whispered “ You shall not forget.”
Life with you amissing
What were it but death ?
Red lips, red lips were kissing,
With love on every breath ;
But my life was cold and dry,
Every man had maid to mate,
Love said, “Gladys waits, and why,
Why should you let Gladys wait? ”
Gladys lifts a finger,
Merrily laughs, and low
Three sister ringlets linger
And toss on her brow of snow.
Gladys says “ I told you so,
You were proud and I was cool ;
If men go —why, let them go,
That is woman’s golden rule.”
Gladys says the bluest
Eyes are those unseen,
The falsest love turns truest
With lonely leagues between.
“ So if men-lovers wish to stray,”
Says Gladys, “ they are free to go,
But when they come another day
Sweethearts shall say ‘ I told you so.’”
RODERIC QUINN.
“FELLOW FEELING
So, lie you there, you faded, tattered glove,
Cast off, that once enclosed the hand I love,
That shielded it from sun and biting wind,
Or yielded to my hand-clasp not unkind.
How low to fall from such a height! Ah me !
I wot you’ve fallen in good company.
For would not I have served that hand as well
As ever you ? And yet I also fell !
And stili you bear the impress, faint, but true,
Of those small, taper fingers that I knew.
And there you lie, a relic of the past,
And keep the shape she gave you to the last!
You were a faithful friend. In confidence
Have you conveyed full many a sweet pretence ;
Returned the gentle pressure which I gave,
And made me, even like yourself, a slave.
Did you believe her when, with dainty care,
She smoothed you out upon her hand so fair,
And vowed, by Cupid’s dart and Venus’ dove,
That thenceforth she would wear no other glove?
What thought you when she raised you to her lips
As I passed by, and kissed your glossy tips?
Confess ! You dreamed of favor in her sight ?
Alas, my friend ! I shared your sorry plight.
For know, poor comrade in my vain regrets,
Not always faithful service love begets.
Your usefulness is past; my day is over —
She has obtained new gloves and a new lover.
NIL.
LOVE AND DEATH.
A rose grew in a garden fair
With leaves flushed palely through their gold ;
The queen of all the roses there,
As every wooing zephyr told.
Then in a moment of desire
I plucked it from its parent tree,
And kissed its heart with lips of fire—
So dear a thing it was to me.
I saw it to my kiss unclose
In richer bloom, as to the sun,
Yet ere to beauty’s height it rose
It dropped its petals one by one.
Unplucked, perchance a space of days
The rose had longer kept its bloom ;
It died, and unto death gave praise,
That loving lips should be its doom.
And I am wondering with each breath
Why love and death are rivals so,
I loved that which was loved of death—
But did death conquer ? Love says “No ! ”

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1897.
Permanent and Reproductive Works.
For the current financial year, ending 30th
June, 1898, the New South Wales Govern-
ment proposes to spend £1,839,605 of borrowed
money on public works. This will be the
biggest single year’s loan expenditure since
1893. It will be the biggest loan expendi-
ture in the Seven Provinces—barring that of
Westralia, and Westralia, being in a state of
irresponsible insanity, hardly counts. Also, it
will be the biggest loan expenditure per head
of population in the Seven Provinces, Wes-
tralia and Queensland alone excepted. Further,
Premier Reid’s loan estimates show the largest
amount of loan money expended on works
which are not permanent, and are wholly un-
reproductive ; and which are not “ works ” at
all in any legitimate sense, but mere current
expenditure ; and which it is a gross swindle to
charge to posterity—that N.S.W. has ever
yet expended in one year. Out of the above
£1,839,605 the sum of £772,000 is for works
which maty fairly be set down as reproductive,
and £200,000 for works which are probably re-
productive. The other £BOO,OOO odd consists
of casual jobs and repairs which any decently-
honest Government would defray out of re-
venue. Only if they were defrayed out of re-
venue Premier Reid would have to show a huge
deficit and admit that his system had broken
down, and then he would either have to tax his
friend, the rich and mainly German importer,
to get more revenue, or treble the land and
income-tax, or do something equally desperate.
And it is so very much more easy to pass the
bill along to posterity and let things slide.
Posterity, not being born yet, hasn’t a chance
to say anything.
• * * *
The swindle which the Reid Government
does under this head grows more awful every
year. Among the items which are set down as
being “ permanent and reproductive works”
are “landing silt, £25,000,” and improve-
ments to the Sydney Botanic Gardens' (pre-
sumably grass and trees and flowers), £BOOO.
The politician who can assert that the grass and
other improvements are “ permanent,’' or that
either they or the silt will bring in a penny of
revenue, has a very beautiful gift of inaccuracy.
Then £lB,OOO goes for lighthouses, and £137,600
for dredging rivers. The dredging isn’t per-
manent ; it is an item that will have to be done
over and over again as the rivers silt up till the
end of time—in fact, it is as much a regular
annual expense as Premier Reid s salary ; and
neither it nor the lighthouses will bring in any
revenue whatever; nevertheless, they also go
down under the “permanent and reproduc-
tive ” heading. Gaols, police-stations, and lock-
ups account for £50,000 ; instead of being repro-
ductive, these will cost a vast sum annually for
maintenance. Also, as N.S.W. will probably
keep on growing till it has a population of
50,000,000 or so, the expenditure for new gaols
and lockups will go on for the next two cen-
turies or so. And, by the time the country has
got all the new gaols and lockups it requires,
it will be time to re-build the old ones, so this
is also a regular annual expenditure which will
go on for ever—or till crime is abolished. New'
furniture for the accommodation - house at
Jenolan is also put down as permanent and re-
productive ; yet chairs and crockery aren’t per-
manent, by any means. About ,£40,000 goes
for hospitals and lunatic asylums ; George
Reid has actually the gall to assert that hos-
pitals and lunatics are paying investments.
Repairs to the Sydney Post Office, to Govern-
ment House, to the Art Gallery, and to the
Museum absorb ,£30,000, and £lO,OOO goes in
arbitration expenses, and Premier Reid
solemnly alleges that these are reproductive
and permanent. The Bdlgetin w'ould like to
know what the great Foreign-trade boss thinks
of his own veracity in the above cases.

£145,580,637 £52,686,136 £198,266,773
These figures show that, up to the beginning of
the Reid regime, N.S. W. loan-mongering had
been comparatively honest, as the comparative
honesty of these provinces goes. Maoriland
was then the horrilde example of Australasia ;
under the policy of the unspeakable Vogel, and
other men almost as mad and unspeakable, it
spent fully three-fifths of its loans in paying
little every-day expenses which should have
been charged to revenue, and in laying up an
awful legacy for posterity. Tasmania was only
a shade better ; Victoria occupied bv far the
best position in the matter of honesty, despite
the Gillies boom-insanity, but N.S.W. at
least filled second place, though it was a
very bad second place, and its record was
three times worse than that of Victoria. At
that date, the Maoriland population owed £35
per head, for which there were no profitable
assets to show ; the people of Tasmania, £22
145.; Queensland, £2O; S.A., nearly ,£l5;
Westralia, £8 125.; N.S. W., £6 155.; and Vic-
toria, only £2 Bs.
* * * *
With the beginning of the Reid regime, how-
ever, things changed materially. For the
single year ending June ’96 the loan expendi-
ture of the Seven Provinces was given by
Coghlan as follows :
Productive. Unproductive. Total.
£ £ £
Tasmania 2,318 110,960 113,278
Queensland 281,781 310,377 592,158
N.S.W. 711,346 559,552 1,270,898
Maoriland 241,988 170,342 412.330
Westralia 409,819 240,889 650,708
S.A. 351,365 181,792 533,157
Victoria 218,796 218,796
£2,217,413 £1,573,912 13,791,325
In that year, under Reid’s guidance, New
South Wales spent more money’ on unproduc-
tive works—in other words, on works which
are properly payable out of revenue and which
are only charged to loans to create a bogus sur-
plus—than any other province, and nearly twice
as much as the next worst province—Queens-
land. It spent more per head of population
than either Maoriland or Victoria. It spent
a larger proportion of its loan money in
the work of making a bogus surplus than either
Victoria, S.A., Westralia or Maoriland, so
instead of having second place for comparative
honesty as formerly it came fourth. And
whereas in all previous years it spent, on an
average, £200,000 a year of loan money for
purely revenue purposes, Reid raised the out-
lay under this head to £559,000.
* * * *
For the year ending June, 1897, things got a
shade worse. Coghlan’s figures were :
Productive Unproductive
Loan Ditto Total.
Expenditure
Maoriland ... £254,530 £835,060 £1,089 590
Tasmania ... 27,000 54,801 81 801
N.S.W. ... 985,447 562,658 1,545!105
Queensland ... 742,357 405,984 1,148 341
S- A -, ••• 239,685 118,973 358,658
Westralia ... 1,943,789 665,880 2,609 669
Victoria ... 212,115 49,417 261’532
£4,404,923 £2,692,773 £7,097£96
The Maoriland figures are hardly a fair cri-
terion, inasmuch as they include £500,000
advanced to the 8.N.Z., which advance’has
since become productive. Taking the figures
as they stand, however, the N.S. Wales ex-
penditure on unproductive works has again
increased, and is the largest except that
of M.L. and Westralia. Also, N.S. W. mis-
applied a larger proportion of its loan
money than any other province save two, and
one of these two—Tasmania—is run on a system
of such ghastly financial profligacy that it has
apparently nothing ahead of it save insolvency.
Also N.S.W. “ blewed ” more loan-money than
any other province save the awful drunk-land of
W estralia ; and it spent more loan-money, in
proportion to population, for items which should
have been charged to revenue than either Vic-
toria, S. A., or Tasmania. Victoria, for the last
three years, has been the one decent example
of honesty, so far as its loan expenditure is con-
cerned, among the Seven Provinces.
» • * *
This year the N.S.W. expenditure on works
which yield no revenue threatens to be £250,000
more even than it was last year. And, seeing
that the loan outlay on unproductive works has
doubled from the time when Dibbs ruled in 93
to Reid’s beautifully prosperous year of 1897-
98, it is about time to ask where this sort of
thing is to end. New South Wales and Wes-
tralia are the only provinces which are
consistently getting worse in this re-
spect. But until every province of Austral-
asia passes a cast - iron law prohibiting
the expenditure of loan - money on any
save reproductive works, every province is
practically at the mercy of any dishonest and
unscrupulous Government that cares to “ fake
the accounts. It is so beautifully easy to make
a surplus by charging £200,000 or £500,000 or
£900,000 of ordinary ex.’s to the capacious loan
fund. There is absolutely no law or rule to
prevent the Government charging anything it
pleases to posterity in this fashion—even alter-
ations to Sydney Botanical Gardens, and the
“landing of silt,” and the law expenses,
and the new chairs and crockery for Je-
nolan accommodation - house. And the sys-
tem tends to keep the dishonest Treasurer
in office and fire the honest one out. The
public judges the Treasurer largely by his
surplus or his deficit; the one who pays his
bills honestly and has £lOO,OOO shortage is a
bad financier, and the man who charges
£600,000 of his current bills to posterity and
has £lOO,OOO surplus is a good one, and hardly
anybody notices that he is really £400,000
worse than the bad one.
* * * •
The Bulletin reckons that a law to shut
down definitely on the practice of charging
non-revenue-producing works to loans is badly
wanted in all the Seven Provinces. In the one
province—Victoria—which is going straight for
the time being it is wanted against the time when
the next boom-profligate gets into office. In the
case of the four regular horrible examples—
Tasmania, Westralia, Queensland, and N.S.W T .
—and the tolerably regular horrible example of
S.A., it is needed as a safeguard against the
boom-profligate already in office. At all events,
the attempt is worth making. It would at
least draw attention to a huge and growing
evil, and it would compel quite a number of
shady politicians to declare themselves de-
finitely. Any number of members annually
pass the iniquitous Loan Estimates, because
their own little parochial job is included
therein, and say nothing, who would not dare
to assert openly and definitely, and back up
the assertion with a straight-out vote, that the
landing of silt, and the new cups and saucers for
Jenolan accommodation-house, are “permanent
and reproductive works.” So far, unfor-
tunately, no one has compelled them to commit
themselves on the point.
Australia’s Duty to J. Bull.
In four of the Australias there is an agitation
to secure the amendment of the mining law ;
and J. Bull is rolling the log in each place.
Lowles, M.P., and Somers Vine are Bull’s
chief representatives in Victoria ; while in
N.B.W. Mr. Charles J. Alford, “member of
the London Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgy,” has in the same interest been taking
for the text of a series of discourses the legalised
iniquity under which the Wentworth Pro-
prietary might have been forced to en-
gage men in order to fulfil labor cove-
nants. This, in fact, constitutes the pet
grievance everywhere: this inability of the
mine lessee to shut up shop and tell re-
fractory workmen to go and starve until they
shall be in a duly meek aiid submissive frame
of mind. Mr. Alford is good enough to out-
line a scheme which embodies the whole duty
of the “Colonial” man—to J. Bull. And this
is the ninth commandment, which is the last
and greatest of all :
When the holder shall have expended on the ground,
in work and machinery, a sum equal to, say, £5OO per
acre of his area, he should be entitled to apply for and
obtain a permanent lease or title to the mine, with the
obligations only to keep the boundaries adequately
beaconed, and to pay an annual rent of, say, £lO per
acre ; but these titles should not be granted to holders of
less than 10-acre blocks.
Certainly not; they should only be granted to
Fat men.
* * * *
But, going back, the principle is rickety. The
man who legitimately spends <£2oo per acre out
of his own pocket in prospecting is a good deal
more entitled to this perpetual lease than the
other fellow who has raised £lOOO worth of
stone or ore per acre and spent £5OO of it in the
process. The Broken Hill Block 10 co. has, for
instance, spent, no doubt, more than £5OO per
acre ; but it was on ore all the time—in other
words, the development need not have cost
it a penny. On the other hand the adjacent
JNorth Central, which has sunk a shaft several
hundred feet and done much other prospecting,
has got no ore ; wherefore all its expenditure
has come out of shareholders’ pockets. And
now those shareholders are naturally getting
tired ; but as they, who have really introduced
and spent 50 times more capital than Block 10
has done, possibly haven’t yet sunk quite £5OO
per acre, Mr. Alford would not give them the
security of a perpetual lease, though he would
not hesitate to give it to Block 10. Which
seems pretty rough on the North Central, and
a beautifully soft thing for B.H. Block 10.
* * * »
it isanother plan, in short, for Greasing the Fat
Bull. At present, it is true, no distinction in
the matter of rent, &c., is made between the
two classes of mines illustrated ; but, then
under the present law (for which nobody’ claims
perfection , no permanent title is conferred.
But plainly, Mr. Alford wants the State to
part with all interest in even the richest of its
mines its mines, please-as soon as the lessees
ha\ e spent out of the proceeds of such mines, or
otherwise, a sum equal to £5OO per acre !
When Mr Alford can find a private landlord
such an idiot as to do anything of the kind,
he will oblige Ihe Bulletin if he will
arrange an early introduction— The Bulletin
wants to bow him badly. It is as
it a ground landlord in a young city should say
to a tenant: “You collect the rents and stick
to them ; and when you have got enough to put
up a building worth .£lOOO you can have the lot
for ever for £1 a jear—always provided ” (Thb
Bulletin had almost forgotten this important
concession) “ you put up a fence to keep every-
body else out.” Simply because the landlord is
the State in an Australian province, while the
tenant is occasionally J. Bull, it is seriously
proposed we should be guilty of this idiocy.
These provinces are, under the influence of the
“ crimson thread,” capable of a great deal, hut
not quite that much.
* * * *
It is part of Mr. Alford’s mission to prove
the exceeding great value of Bull’s capital to
Australian mining. “In many cases,” he says,
“ a mining property for which a working
capital of £50,000 would be none too large is
taken up by a party of men who, between them,
could not raise £5OO for any object.” Quite true.
But it is equally true that in more cases a pro-
perty for which a working capital of £5OOO
would be ample has been secured by men who
have formed a company with a nominal capital
of £50,000, ostensibly to work it, but in reality
to manipulate it until such time as they' could
ease themselves of their promoters’ shares.
Over-capitalisation is a bigger curse than under-
capitalisation. There are mines which “re-
main undeveloped for want of capital ” ; there
are more which have been damned because they
could not pay reasonable returns to companies
burdened with non-contributing shares, expen-
sive boards of utterly ignorant directors, extra-
vagant officers, and so on. The mine that
really wants a working capital of £50,000
occurs so very rarely, and is still more rarely
recognised when it does occur, that it isn’t a
fair basis for a new law. J. Bull has a pro-
digious idea of “ putting money into mines.”
The Australian experience lias been that mining
is most successful where the mine worries along
and provides its own money. Capital is a help
to speedily develop a property, no doubt, and
get returns ; but those are advantages which,
in nine cases out of ten, are bought at far too
high a price.
* * * *
But when Mr. Alford declares that “one
very fruitful source of disaster is the law
which allows the formation of no - liability
companies in which shareholders cannot be
obliged by law to pay the calls on the shares
which they have taken up,” he says something
that The Bulletin has said several times be-
fore ; and he adds that “it is little short of
criminal in any Government to frame laws
which plainly tempt reckless or ignorant people
to invest their money and their work in under-
takings which have not the remotest chance of
ultimate success as legitimate ventures.” The
only justification of the law is that Govern-
ments know mining (on the share-market and
to some extent also elsewhere) is a gamble, and
they allow means whereby people smitten with
funk or conscience or poverty or sense may
withdraw and forfeit at any moment. That is
well enough ; and if onlyproperties “which have
not the remotest chance of ultimate success”
were affected, it wouldn’t matter much. In
fact, it might be a good thing. Unfortunately,
although the excuse for the game of back-up-
or-forfeit (for there has to be an excuse, since
the Godly indulge in it) is very often a wild-
cat, sometimes it is a genuine “show”—a
“show” which has cost some poor devil of a
prospector years of “ battling,” in which he
has sunk every penny he could earn, or beg, or
borrow, in which all his hopes and his girl’s or
his family’s hopes are centered. For his
“ whack ” he gets a few pounds in cash (hypo-
thecated long since at the store or the pub.),
the promoters taking the rest; and 20,000 or
so shares. When the boom collapses and not
enough calls come in to pay directors’ fees and
office expenses, the “show ” is sold by the bailiff
or the liquidator ; and sometimes the prospector
buys it, but generally he can’t. Anyway, the
“show” is damned; it has been tried (and
what a trial !) and found wanting. And Mr.
Alford may observe that this system, the
greatest curse which the mining industry in
this country has to dodge, has operated with
more deadly results in connection with J.
Bull’s Westralian ventures than it did even
in connection with the N.S.W, silver flutter.
And how his scheme (which, broadly, is the
scheme of the other representatives of J. Bull)
is going to improve matters in this most im-
portant respect Mr. Alford has forgotten to
explain.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Libel Law Again.
Dear Bulletin, —The recent case of Kelly v.
Sydney Daily Telegraph is an interesting
example of how the law, as laid down by the
Judges, though professing to be based solely on
precedent, really advances with the advancing
needs of the community. The decision of the
Supreme Court is noticeable for the emphatic
way in which it lays down the privileges of
newspaper proprietors as regards the publica-
tion of judicial proceedings, and more so because
it goes farther than any previous decision of our
Courts. “It is clear,” said Darley, C.J.,
delivering the judgment of the Full Court,
“ that it is the open Court that establishes the
privilege. . . . Certainlyby thestatutelaw both
in England and the colony the press is privileged
to publish a true and correct account of v\hat-
takes place in Courts of Justice,” and this
opinion was fortified by the citation of several
cases. Now, this opinion seems to be, and is, a
boon to the newspaper-man ; but, unless read
carefully, is in reality a pitfall. If by the word
“ Court ” is meant a “Court of competent juris-
diction ” —as a lawyer would understand it—
well and good ; if, on the other hand, “Court ”
is taken to include a preliminary inquiry before
a magistrate—as a layman would think—then
the decision is not good law, and is in direct
opposition to the express words of an Act of
Parliament. By the Justices Acts, the place
where a justice sits to try an information is an
open and public court, and, since the Defama-
tion Act provides that no action or information
will lie for a faithful and accurate report
of any judicial proceedings, a report of these
proceedings before a justice would fall withip


the protection of the statute. On the other
hand, when a man is charged before a justice
with an offence which the justice has no jurisdic-
diction to try him for, but which he must send on
to a higher court, the justice is not “ trying an
information,’’lie is only sitting ministerially and
is not holding a “ court.” This being so, no re-
port of such an enquiry is privileged. Again,
even if it were a court, the Defamation Act,
while making reports of judicial proceedings
privileged, goes on to state “ provided, how-
ever, that these proceedings are not of a pre-
liminary nature.” The reason for this proviso
is obvious; in a preliminary enquiry the
accused’s mouth is shut, the evidence given
against him is an ex-parte statement of the
prosecution, and it is not fair play to a man to
publish the case against him which will pro-
bably be read by the jurors who are to try his
case at a later period. This latest decision of
the court does, however, advance the law a few
steps, and that, too, in favor of the press. The
Daily Telegraph is going to appeal to the
Privy Council —a plucky proceeding, but a
hopeless one ; the decision of the Full Court to
grant a new trial will be confirmed.—Rus.

The Cabbage-Tree Mob.
The Legislative Council of New South Wales
passed the second reading of the Bill
for making Federation impossible with a
loud enthusiasm quite out of the usual habit
of that placid body. There was hardly a
semblance of discussion. The old cabbage-tree
mob was loud and blatant, and hideously
triumphant, and it threw all the decencies of
debate overboard. Every time a Federationist
rose to speak, the voice of some member of the
cabbage-tree brigade was uplifted to move
“ that the lion, member be not heard,” and the
cabbage-tree majority carried the motion every
time. Even Barton, despite the fact that he
represented nearly 100,000 votes at a popular
election, and was the authorised representative
of one-third of the electors of New South Wales,
was refused a hearing—mainly at the instance
of the Reid Government’s own representative,
Attorney-General Want. After this, it would
be beastly ingratitude for Premier Reid to
interfere with the Upper House. So far as
concerns the most important question of the
day, Reid and the nominee Council are of
one mind. It was Reid who suggested
fixing the minimum affirmative vote required to
carry Federation at 80,000 instead of the 50,000
previously agreed upon, and his Attorney-
General supported it with tremendous vigor,
and the Council carried it in a burst of enthu-
siasm ; and, under these circumstances, if the
Reid Government isn’t grateful to the Council
it ought to be. And just about here a curious
side-issue comes in. The Reid Government
assigns, as a reason for demanding not only a
popular majority in favor of Federation, but
also a majority mustering at least 80,000 votes,
that it is necessary to show a reasonable pro-
portion of the people to be actually in favor of
a momentous change before anything is done.
Even if there are only 1000 or 100 votes, or no
votes at all, against it, Reid holds that the
minority should have its way unless the majority
can muster the tremendous number of 80,000
active supporters, simply because the latter
crowd represents a new idea, while the former
represents an old one that is hallowed by the
grime of antiquity—and the grime of antiquity
isn’t to be lightly interfered with. Yet Reid
proposes, by a bare majority if he can get one,
to burst-up the N.S.W. Legislative Council,
which is as old and as sacred and as grimy as
the provincial system. It isn’t to be burst-
up only provided 80,000 voters declare by
a referendum that they want it destroyed ;
if the Reid Government comes back with a
majority in the Legislature, even if that
majority is returned by only 50,000 votes or
less, the process is to go ahead. Therefore,
Reid obviously doesn’t believe, except when it
suits him, in his own assertion that important
existing institutions shouldn’t be interfered
with unless by the direct mandate of 80,000
electors. But the Council probably does believe
in it, and when the Government tries to shift
it on the strength of an indirect mandate from,
perhaps, 70,000 electors, it will probably refuse
to go on the ground that old institutions are
not to be thrown overboard in this fashion.
And when Attorney-General Want boils over
at the recalcitrant fossils who won’t abolish
themselves, old man Dangar will probably move
“ that the hon. member be not heard.” Which
will be an interesting situation.

A Matter of Evidence.
The value of the average witness’s evidence in
courts of law may well be reckoned by the
various stories told by alleged eye-witnesses as
to the time at which the big Melbourne fire
broke out. The fire-brigades were called at
2.20 a.m., and when the call was received the
watchman on the tower was unable to see any
sign of smoke or fire even with the aid of a
powerful night-glass. Police are constantly
parading the locality, cabmen are flitting about,
and, as the present writer’s labors do not cease
until 2 a.m., it is within his own knowledge
that in the streets surrounding the gutted block
there are never less than 20 or 30 persons. And
all these nocturnal pedestrians and drivers
agree that the first flame was not visible until
2.15. The man who broke the fire-alarm, a
home-going meter-inspector, reached the locality
and was passing it at that hour when the
cracking of a window aroused his attention
and he walked right up to the burning
building before he saw its condition. Now
comes the other side of the story. A caretaker
in an opposite building saw the fire blazing so
brightly as to illuminate the whole city at 1.35
a.m. ; another caretaker and his whole family
and the night-watchman of the building saw
the same thing at 2 a.m. ; two more watchmen
on the opposite side of the burnt block
saw it at 1.45 ; six nurses at Melbourne Hos-
pital saw the blazes rising high in the air at
1.30, one nurse distinctly hearing the Town
Hall clock chime the half-hour (which clock, it
has since been shown, does not chime), and the
look-out man on a timber-boat on the Lower
Yarra supports this view. Rebutting evidence
supporting the police and the alarm-giver is
given by more watchmen, the passing sub-editor
of a Melb. daily, and a resident hotelkeeper
opposite the fire, and at present the matter ends
there. There is not the slightest end to he
gained by lying by the majority of these wit-
nesses ; it is probable that all fully believe
themselves to be telling the truth ; but when
honest people vary in such a manner as this the
worth of judicial evidence, which is largely
tempered with dishonesty, falls ninety per cent.,
and makes one wonder whether it would not be
better to do away with evidence altogether in
courts of law, and go back to the ancient and
more simple method of determining guilt by
chucking the prisoner into a tank and seeing if
he will float.
The Dry Sunday Crow-Eater.
The moral legislators of S.A. are trying to tear
the Sunday liquor business up by the roots, and
if they don’t succeed it won’t be through lack of
vigor. The measure now under consideration in
the Holy City still allows the bona-fide traveller
to be supplied with refreshment under suspicion
and after microscopical examination into his
antecedents, but it aims at making life a burden
to the ordinary Sunday drinker. It is proposed
that any person, not a lodger or bona-fide
traveller, found attempting to get into a hotel
on Sunday may be fined as much as .£2O.
There is no definition of what constitutes
“ attempting,” so even leaning up against the
wall of a S.A. hotel on Sunday may be costly.
Anybody not being a bona-fide lodger or
traveller who is found in a hotel on Sunday
is to be run in and fined up to .£2O unless
he can prove that he (or she) was not after
liquor. It is not necessary to be found drink-
ing, or asking for drink, or in the bar, or even
to be discovered wearing a thirsty expression ;
merely being found on the premises, unless the
accused can legally prove that he wouldn’t drink
even if pressed to do it, is sufficient. Also, the
landlord is heavily fineable for the person being
on his premises. This clause provides for the
wholesale running-in of the individual who
only wanted dinner, and of the landlord’s
mother-in-law, and of the regular lodger’s
brother, and of the doctor who called to see
after the lodger’s lung, and their incarceration
until they clear their characters to the satisfac-
tion of the bench. Moreover, though the
lodger may buy drink for himself on Sunday, if
he buys drink and gives it to someone else he is
to get particular Gehenna. Also, the landlord
who sells the drink, if it is afterwards given to
someone else, is to get particular Gehenna
also. Further, the bona-fide traveller is to
walk twice as far as he used to
do, or else tell twice as large a lie about
the distance he has walked as he used to do.
If this law passes, the South Australian will
absolutely have to lay in his liquor on Saturday
night. In this paper’s opinion, nothing proves
more conclusively the shiftlessness and want of
foresight of the average Australian than his
neglect to lay in his liquor on Saturday night.
All the worry of all the Sunday-drink legisla-
tion in all the seven provinces is caused by the
fact that 500,000 adult males, who are thirsty
every Sunday, can’t remember once a week that
they will be thirsty next Sunday also.
Melbourne Argus, on the Sandhurst Cup :
The owners of the majority of the horses had been laid
something- out of the sweep. The owner of Ayrshire was
not similarly fortunate, and though the horse was on the
ground he was scratched three-quarters of an hour before
the announced time of starting.
Which is practically an expression of news-
paper sympathy with the blackmailing system
practised upon ticket-holders by these alleged
sportsmen, whereas the aim of the daily press
should be to abolish the scandal. “ Tatter-
sall,” surely, is losing customers through the
notorious rapacity of the men who have
assumed a right to tax his sweep prizes. How
comes it that horse-owners are in a position to
make terms with Tatt.’s private clients?
Whence do they derive their knowledge of the
names and addresses of the parties they wish to
bleed ? In the case of Ayrshire, for instance,
it is clear that the ticket-drawer didn’t make
overtures to the stable. And if the offer of a
cash inducement was not hurled at Ayr-
shire’s owner we may assume that his
more fortunate brethren were, for the most
part, blackmailers (on the strength of in-
formation received from Tatt.’s office?)
rather than honorable recipients of gratui-
tous offers. In a negative way Tatt. is
responsible for the dirty business that grows out
of his lotteries. He has the power to curb it
by advising ticket-holders to refuse any impu-
dent demand for a share in their luck—when
they get it. A ticket in a Tatt.’r sweep is
advertised as an investment worth 90 per cent,
of its face value, but if the drawer of a pro-
bable starter is to be robbed entirely of his
three great chances, unless he agrees to forfeit
about the half of them, then the price stamped
on each ticket is a public delusion. If Tatt.
were to suddenly reduce his Ist, 2nd and 3rd
prizes by one-half or even one-third of their
present amount his clients would object to
being plundered, yet it makes no difference to a
winning ticket-holder w hether the 30 or 50 per
cent, reduction in his prize is wrought by the
promoter of the sweep, or the horse-ow'ner.
The public will never again get a fair chance to
win the full amount of the prizes they gamble
for until “ Tattersall ” takes measures to safe-
guard them from the blackmailers.
Apropos the Suffield case. At Central
Criminal Court, Sydney, on Nov. 24, before
Mr. Justice Stephen, William Booth was
charged wdth criminally assaulting a young
woman at Hamilton, near Newcastle, on Octo-
ber 30. There was a second count of common
assault. Mr. R. Windeyer, instructed by Mr.
J. Windeyer, appeared for the accused, who
pleaded not guilty. The jury found the accused
not guilty. (According to S.M. Herald) “ His
Honor said he thought the jury had done the
right thing. Had accused been found guilty it
would have been with very great reluctance he
would have sentenced, him. It only added
another to the many instances of a large propor-
tion of that kind which broke dovm for want of
reliance to be placed on the evidence of the pro-
secutrix." Booth was thereupon discharged from
custody. Nothing, of course, happened to the
woman wdiom the jury disbelieved. Nothing
ever does. In such cases the woman says
“Heads I win, tails you lose.” If the jury
believes her, and the man is found guilty, he
goes to gaol or the gallows ; if the jury doesn’t
believe her, she goes scot-free. This, however,
is not what the Shriek-Female means when she
raves of the inequality of the laws for men and
women. By the way, Suffield’s alleged out-
rage was also said to have been committed near
Newcastle; but he was not “ defended by Mr.
R. Windeyer, instructed by Mr. J. Win-
deyer.” In his case, the Windeyer was on
the bench—which made all the difference.
+
What is known to the members of the N.S.
Wales Assembly as the “ Stephens’ case,” is a
matter worth noting, and should receive serious
attention from that portion of the community
which the respectable daily press describes as
“right-thinking persons.” The facts of the
case are these : On 29 Dec., ’93, a draper named
Stephens reported to the police that his store
in Liverpool-street, Sydney, had been robbed of
goods to the value of .£l5O. Two men were
arrested, Sugarman and Fernandez. At the
trial, Fernandez was found guilty and sen-
tenced to two years imprisonment, while
Sugarman was discharged. The latter then
sued the unfortunate Stephens for malicious
prosecution, claiming £3OOO damages ! The
Crown Law Department was promptly notified
of this monstrous claim made on a man for an
arrest with which he had nothing to do, he
having madeno chargeagainst Sugarman, nor in
any way hinted to the police that Sugarman had
stolen his goods. All that Stephens did was
the simple reporting of the robbery to the
police, they making the arrest on their own re-
ponsibility. At this point the Law Depart-
ment washed its hands of the whole business,
and consequently Stephens, acting on legal
advice, had to defend the case which he, of
course, won. A couple of days after, Sugar-
man went insolvent—assets 15s.— Stephens
being £9O out of pocket defending the action.
He applied to the Attorney-General’s Depart-
ment to have this sum refunded to him, as he
was in no way to blame for the arrest, he being
simply bound over as a Crown witness during
the Quarter Sessions trial. A Select Committee
has reported in favor of Stephens’ claim,
but the Government refuses to accept
the Committee’s recommendation ! When the
adoption of the report was submitted it was
talked out, and there is every likelihood of its
being burked this session, and eventually drop-
ping into a peaceful oblivion, which is the
stereotyped way out of departmental difficul-
ties. Had Stephens not defended this case, he
would, no doubt, have had a very large verdict
recorded against him, and so he is mulct in
£9O costs over a matter which he had no hand
in, and which was directly caused by the
Government’s own officers ! Such is justice in
N.S. Wales, and no member has the backbone
to seriously tackle the iniquity.

Premier Reid’s scheme of Upper House re-
form will be miserably incomplete if it does not
do away with the present privilege enjoyed by
the barrister members of that body. These
may, and regularly do, hire themselves out to
Government, thus sinning in a way which, if
other tradesmen legislators copied it, would be
denounced by lawyerdom as a high crime
against the Constitution. Why should one
member be prevented from selling bread or
bacon to the Government, while another is
privileged to sell law ? Reid, who looks with
favor on the present practice, complains that if
a Government were not authorised to employ
Legislative Council barristers it would often
have to forego the best talent; but the com-
plaint is as applicable to every kind of contrac-
tor as to the legal one. Further, the amount
of patronage the present practice confers on a
Government has an unhealthy effect on patrons
and patronised.

Q.N. Bank Committee makes it clear, among
the other shocking things, that the bank was
practically insolvent in 1892 or even earlier,
and was only saved from ruin by the £600,000
loan hastily raised by Government at the in-
stance of the bank’s casual overdrafter, Trea-
surer MTlwraith. In the light of this,
present-Treasurer Nelson’s certificate of 23rd
June, 1893, is pleasant reading :
With regard to the main question—whether this par-
ticular hank (the Q.N.) is sound or otherwise, I may state
that the duty—a duty which I would like very much to
have passed over, but it was inevitable in my case—has
devolved upon me of making A MOST MINUTE AND
SEARCHING examination into the affairs of that insti-
tution. THAT I HAVE DONE, devoting nearly the
whole of my time to it since the House adjourned a fort-
night ago. I have given the matterthe MOSTTHOROUGH
AND SEARCHING INVESTIGATION. I have had an
opportunity of seeing ALL the securities of the bank,
AND EVEN THE CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS BELONGING
TO THE INSTITUTION. I have also had the able assist-
ance of my colleague, the Secretary' for Lands (Mr. Bar-
low), who has had a large experience previously in bank-
ing concerns ; and the result of our investigation is that I
am able to report, as I have already reported to my col-
leagues, that, in my opinion, in which my colleague, the
Secretary for Lands, concurs, the assets of the bank,
taken at a fair and reasonable valuation, and assuming
any fair method of realisation, are more than sufficient to
pay the debts of the bank to the Government, as well as
to the outside public. This investigation, I CAN ASSURE
THE HOUSE, has not been performed in any perfunctory
manner, but has been one which enables me to say with
full conviction that I am speaking the truth THAT WHAT
I HAVE STATED WITH REGARD TO THE SOUNDNESS
OF THE BANK IS CORRECT.
And that man Nelson is now Treasurer of
Queensland !
All through the Q.N. Bank censure debate the
Nelson Government and its barrackers per-
sistently evaded the matter really at issue.
Premier Nelson and his colleague Barlow, in
1893, overhauled the affairs of the bank, and
reported that it was perfectly sound, whereas
it had lost all its capital and some £2,000,000
besides. And the plea put forward is that
they merely over-valued the securities, at a
time when it was very difficult to make a
correct valuation, and put down six or seven
millions worth at nine millions. But nothing
is said about the many big disastrous loans for
which there was no security at all, and about
which Nelson and Barlow said nothing.
Supposing A and B each borrow £lO,OOO from
a bank, A giving no security, while B’s loan is
covered twice over. And supposing Nelson
and Barlow value B’s security at £30,000, then
it is quite correct to say that the bank has ad-
vancecl £20,000 and holds £30,000 worth oj
security. But the fact that B’s £lO,OOO loan is
covered three times over doesn’t make A’s
£lO,OOO loan anything else than the horrible
bad debt or bad swindle that it was before.
No matter how much or how guilelessly Nel-
son and Barlow over-estimated the securities
held against good accounts, that couldn’t make
the bad accounts against which there was no
security look one shade or one fraction better.
And Nelson and Barlow said nothing about
the ruinous losses on unsecured, or practically
unsecured, accounts. Tozer’s wail on their
behalf is that they merely over-valued things
in the aggregate to the extent of 2s. 9d. in the
£—which is wholly irrelevant. A bank might
advance two millions or ten millions worth of
security, and yet be utterly ruined—if the ten
millions worth were deposited to cover one
million of the advances, and the other million
was lent on the personal I O U’s of a crowd of
insolvent politicians.
From Moree (N.S.W.) News, of 19 Nov. :
That Licensing Case. —In re the recent refusal of the
local Licensing Bench to grant a transfer to Mrs. Brooker
and comments since made by the Bulletin thereon, we
may point out that the Police-Magistrate intimated his
own opinion before reading those of the Attorney-General
and Crown-Solicitor, and his opinion was that a divorced
woman could not hold a license. The opinions men-
tioned were only read in confirmation, and in reality had
nothing to do with the Court’s decision, which would
have been the same in any case.
A little more talk about this evil of sending
opinions to “ guide ” country police-magistrates
may do good. The P.M. undoubtedly gave bis
opinion, and then immediately read tiie Depart-
mental opinions and said that they strengthened
his opinion. Why did not the fact that the
attorney who represented the applicant thought
otherwise weaken that same opinion ? It does
not matter a bit whether the P.M.’s opinion
was identical with the Departmental one’s, nor
does it matter that the result, as the P.M.
alleges, would have been the same in any case ;
the fact remains that the Bench had-those
opinions before it and read them in open
court—which, to an evenly-balanced mind,
would certainly seem to indicate that the
Bench dispensed “ justice by dictation.” The
Bulletin is quite prepared to admit that
the Magistrate’s decision would have been the
same in any case, or at least that the Magis-
trate fully believes it would have been the
same; but it contends that the only guides a
magistrate should have are (1) his own common-
sense ; (2) his head full of legal knowledge ;
(3) his text-books ; (4) the decisions of the
Supreme Court. Any Departmental opinions
should, if a man’s back-bone be strong, be
delegated to the uttermost depths of the
w.p.b.
Speaking at Melb. Presbyterian General
Assembly, Rev. J. Neilson maintained, as a
missionary of 30 years seasoning, that it isn’t
any good going to the expense of another holy
craft like the Dayspring, deceased, because the
work is getting easier. There are 30,000
fewer heathen to work on than when he first
went to the New Hebrides, and he doesn’t be-
lieve there will be 15,000 left at the end of
another 30 years. Which must be pleasant
news for the godly, because it is clear that this
rapid diminution of population is traceable to
the circumstance that Providence whipped off
the converts as fast as they were made. Lest
they should backslide, maybe. Think of it !
Seventy thousand heathens get hold of the
“ Terewth ! ” and it kills ’em off at the rate of a
thousand a year ; and the man who was there
at the beginning of this great plague of glory
supplies the very best argument for avoiding
any further expense, because in 50 years or less
the whole caboodle will be cracking cocoanuts
in Paradise. And yet Paton and RENTOULand
other spendthrifts of the Lord’s vineyard want
to waste a lot more money in running a show
that goes of itself. The "thing is done. The
heathens are saved of soul and doomed of race.
Why hurry those who remain ?

In a vigorous and graphic account of
Klondyke matters given by S.M. Herald’s
special correspondent, Skagwag is described as a
magic city of 4000 inhabitants—sprung into exis-
tence in a couple of months. To condense :
Gambling is rife, drinks 50 cents, and Idol, for a dance
with one of the five houris at the dancing-saloon. Skag-
wag is the starting-point for the White Pass, but it is
estimated that out of the thousands who have essayed
that track not 200 have got through. In one place" 50
dead horses, packs on backs, are lying where they have
fallen over a bluff. Men are sitting dejectedly all along
the trail, many crying miserably over the loss of their
pack-animals, which means exclusion from the golden
region. The stench from the thousands of dead animals
along the trail is murderous.
And, in short, the writer sums up, the only men
who should attempt this frightful journey are the
men who—having splendid health and plenty of
money—have no need to do so. At Dawson
gambling goes on night and day, the dancing-
halls are thronged, and the price of necessaries
runs from 600 to 2000 per cent, above ordinary
figures. A winter of famine is dreaded, and
already new arrivals are being forcibly deprived
of their food supplies, which are paid for and
added to the common winter-stock. And, to get
there, only this :
Swamps to be traversed, and mountains to be climbed,
all the while those infernal flies biting until strong, hardy
men shed tears of impotent rage at their innumerable
enemies. Miner’s gumboots on reaching to your thighs,
each weighing 31b. or 41b., a heavy suit of woollen wear,
blankets, provisions for perhaps 20 or 30 days, axe-pick,
shovel, and other articles—in all 50, 60, or even 80 or
1001 b., on your back, wading, climbing, scrambling, often
in a blistering sun. Perspiration running o f you in
streams, and all the time too the mosquito assailing you
at every 7 vulnerable point. Then, traversing the top of a
divide, the winds almost solidify 7 your perspiration-
saturated garments, and chill the marrow in your bones.
And, after a day of this, sitting down in a cloud of mos-
quitos to sodden bread, beans half-cooked, bacon same,
and a poor grade of coffee or tea ; then a roll in your
blanket, .your head covered up to exclude the mosquito,
for he never rests.

Grattan Biggs is doing a turn of the
“Shaughraun” at Sydney Lyceum, and more
Irish drama is expected later on. Nobody in this
world really knows for certain what a shaughraun
is, or whether it should be taken boiled or raw,
but the drama is a good old stand-by, and always
commands a certain amount of support. Grattan
Riggs, even in his old age, and he must be
something phenomenal in the way of old age
now, makes a very satisfactory Conn. He is,
perhaps, a shade less agile on his legs than some
younger and duller rivals, and his lower notes,
when he breathes soft nothings and whisky into
the shell-like ear of Moya, are a trifle rough, but
otherwise there is nothing to show that Riggs
isn’t just thirty. There is no falling-off in his
humor or in his fine old Sligo brogue, and there is
probably no man in Australia at present who
could play a really aggravated Irish character much
better than G. Riggs. One absolute novelty in
the present rendering of the “Shaughraun” is
that the base informer is a fat man. Every other
Harvey Duff The Bulletin ever saw has been
gaunt and fleshless, but T. P. O’Neil plays him as
a short and immensely blubbery man, who rushes
a huge corporation through a distracted land.
This paper takes rather kindly to the innovation,
and distinctly admires O’Neil. The lean informer
in rusty-black, with snail-tracks on his seams, is a
stereotyped spectre who crawls in a groove ; the fat
one, who is dressed anyhow, is fresh and original.
Besides, no one can show any good reason why an
informer shouldn’t be fat, therefore The Bulletin
reckons the present Duff a great improvement,
even apart from his acting, which is very good.
Miss Eugenie Duggan’s Clare Ffolliott is a pretty
and very nice Irish girl (this lady should have
good prospects if she would call herself something
more melodious than Duggan), and Messrs. Wil-
lard and North are two other characters whom the
writer regards with a favorable eye. The rest of
the cast, represents various grades of respectable
mediocrity. “ Colleen Bawn ” will probably
follow.
* * * *
The “Royal Divorce” looks capable of
holding its own at Her Majesty’s till Xmas. Re-
garded as a spectacle it improves on further
acquaintance. The two pictures of Waterloo, and
the dark red panorama of the fallen potentate on
his rock, took the public fancy from the first, and
the retreat from Moscow appears to meet with
more approval as it goes on. As a series of his-
torical tableaux there is one thing wanted—the
gory smash at Leipsic, which really decided
Napoleon’s downfall, and which, for blood and
howl and chaos, was fully twice as awful as
Waterloo, is altogether left out. But there wasn’t
room for everything, and, anyhow, Waterloo
looks picturesque enouuh. A character who
deserves honorable mention, not because he
has anything to do, but because he makes a
glittering panorama all on his own, is Marshal
Augereau. But, apart from Napoleon himself,
the most really creditable personage in the piece
is Atholwood, as the one inhabitant of Jenappes
who stays behind and gets brilliantly drunk when
all the rest of the population has fled. That Last
Lone Drunk is a gleam of humor in a tragic story.
W hen the fate of Europe is being decided he is
busy in the background running after imaginary
beetles on a deal-table, and probably he never
heard the great downfall, being too busy missing
the last beetle. This solitary inhabitant has an
original hiccup such as the writer never heard
before. Probably it is an ancient hiccuD which
has since gone out of general use.
* * * *
“Binks the Photographer” came to a
well-merited conclusion on Friday night, and
Sydney Palace firmly but unobtrusively closed up.
The closing up of Sydney Palace is now one of the
regular events of the show industry ; at the same
time the opening and shutting of that establish-
ment, and its brilliant re-opening some time after-
wards, and its re-shutting almost before the
re-opening has had time to become known, grow
bewildering. The Bulletin has no desire to lay
any wreaths on the grave of “Binks.” It was a
very flat and undeserving show which consisted of
an uninteresting old man dreaming at great
length about nothing, and it wasn't the sort of
thing J that anybody could consider seriously with
the hot weather coming on. A good company
gave it a far better chance than it deserved, and
held it up until decomposition set in so obviously
that it was absolutely necessary to let go. For
all the public support there was the co. might just
as well have let go the first night.
* * * *
D. H. Caston, vocalist, top-boot dancer,
and various other things,, has added himself to the
Tivoli programme this week, and up till now the
man has impressed the public favorably. Ven-
triloquist Winton has returned, and the loose-
legged comedian, the three Hayters, the two
Waldrons, and Miss Nellie Sheldon make up a
strong bill.
* * * *
There will be three pantomimes in Sydney
this year. At Her Majesty’s the firm will stage
“ The Babes in the Wood,” the Messrs. Macmahon
will produce “ Dick Whittington ” at the Lyceum,
and Harry Rickards’ “Jack the Giant-Killer”
will occupy the Royal. In addition, the Criterion
will be engaged by the Thornton Co. ; at the
Tivoli there will be variety, as usual; Fitzgerald's
Circus will be at the Railway-station ground, and
with the sundry other shows which spring np at
holiday times, the public will have to respond
very liberally to satiate all the managers.
** * *
“The French Maid,” new to Melb. Prin-
cess’s, on Saturday night, may be expected to
keep business humming till her time is up, for, if
“ The Gay Parisienne ” was as good as many
people considered it, “The Maid” is probably
better. On the other hand, if the G.P. wasn’t
a delightful musical comedy, the “ Maid ” is
probably less so. The real merits of these two
similar trifles must remain wrapped in mystery.
They are not strong enough to bear examination.
If one tries to think about them seriously they
disappear in vapor, and leave the mind a blank.
The present writer has a vague recollection that
“ The French Maid ” depends largely on a festive-
looking chorus, whose work is a handsome com-
pliment to everybody concerned in it. Why nob
call the chorus, the musical-director, and the
stage-manager before the curtain, and let the
principals rip, by way of a change? Some of
them ought to bo more often ripping than they
have been'of late.
* * * *
Two or three clever songs, notably “The
Twins” in the first act, appear to have got into
the libretto by accident. It is not at all an invari-
ably clever libretto. The plot is a somewhat dull
arrangement of misunderstandings which arise
from a rather bulky gendarme, and the flirtations
of his misguided girl, and the dense deceitfulness
of a doleful British waiter who suffers from Scotch
blood in his veins. One hollow mockery of a mis-
understanding is created by a baritone naval
lieutenant in love with Juliet Wray. Immedi-
ately on his return from foreign shores the lieuten-
ant rejoins his Juliet in a duet, and they
seem about to get married, but because the
damsel’s sketch-book contains 25 sketches of him-
self this monotonous young man feels persuaded
that an unknown rival has cut him out. Where-
upon he remarks, in a loud, commercial voice,
“ My dream is over,” after the manner of a stock-
broker hailing a cab. The Bulletin once
complained that Charles Ryley was too heavy for
a musical comedy ; but, 0 ! we have been getting
theni heavier since then. The burden of a modern
baritone lover is almost more than vve can bear.
* * • *
Bert Gilbert, as a youthful sailor, and
twin brother of a rather elderly waiter, is again a
bright and spi’ightly comedian, also Coleman (the
waiter aforesaid) displays his pessimistic humor to
the best advantage. Miss Ada Reeve, in the
name-part, is a slightly-revised edition of the
Parisienne—-winsome, dainty, and petite—not
large in any respect. Howard Vernon is awfully
misplaced as the French gendarme. Our old
friend Bunthorne can be humorous when he gets
the chance, but never airy and vivacious. Even
his French accent had to be borrowed from Rip
Van Winkle. Some of the other principals might
be more effective, but the incidental dance by Miss
Cobb and co. is a first-class tonic.
** » *
The Biograph Vaudeville Co. proceeds
along its expensive way, at Melbourne Bijou,
under the particular patronage of the local clergy
and shining lights. There is somewhat of a
solemn, respectable appearance about the name
“Biograph.” Also, it sounds instructive, and
conveys the notion of a Good Show for Good
People;. therefore the elect and the anointed
rolled up steadily to the pay-boxes last week,
whilst bad, ordinary people were mostly in a
hesitating frame of mind—which absurd figure
of speech is plagiarised from the daily press.
In order to dispel any doubt as to the frivolous
tendencies of the Bijou bill it was varied on Satur-
day, when Bellman, and Lottie Moore did a
“ turn ” in place of Phil Newbury, who took his
robust tenor to the Opera House. ' All things con-
sidered, the Biograph has been looming too large
in the Bijou advts., for, although it is a remark-
able improvement on the Cine., it isn’t a new sen-
sation. Moreover, the Bi. makes a sad mistake in
producing some jubilee pictures that don’t seem
much superior to Cine, views on the same
exhausted subject. Miss Fanny Wentworth’s
clever little musical entertainment is a large,
growing success, and Miss Lilian Tree’s top-notes
mount higher in public estimation every time she
faces the music and puts the orchestra to shame.
Just now the tremendous prima-donna is sharing
the miserere from “ II Trovatore ” with Fred
Duncan, so the friends of that pleasant, silvery
tenor had better take measures to prevent him
getting swept into space by the soprano hur-
ricane. Professor Morritt is a bright item who
improves on acquaintance, and other “turns,” in-
cluding the rough-edged boy, are cheerfully
accepted.
** * *
The “Trilby” Burlesque didn’t fall due
at the Royal last Saturday, although evidence in
favor of something different to melodrama has
been observable there for some time past.
“Trilby’’will make a re-appearance next Satur-
day (4th), and the interval is occupied by “ Col-
leen Bawn,” a sound, reliable drama which has no
charm for Maggie Moore’s faithful subjects just
at present. “ Trilby ” ought to shake things up
a bit and clear the air for a pantomime on
Boxing Night. It was said that Melbourne
wouldn’t get any pant, at Xmas, but Maggie has
made arrangements to disprove the assertion, and
the order for a sudden Grand Annual is in the
hands of the builders.

Frank Leon, the mighty clog-stepper, and
Miss Lizzie Kirk, the latest Rickards’ importa-
tion, came to the Opera House on Saturday, and
were voted valuable additions to the co. at that
favorite summer resort.

Dear Bulletin, —R<? the opinion of “Ignoramus” upon
“Two Little Vagabonds.” 1 would suggest that he is a
shocking waste of time as a critic. The man who says
there is no human interest in this famous French melo-
drama, and no pathos in the third act, is a man unfit to
discuss any subject softer than blue metal. Or else he is
incapable of considering stage characters apart from the
performance he witnesses. The two little vagabond parts
have been poorly acted in Australia. —8.8.
The boy soprano imported by Rickards is a musical
item that naturally suggests a question. Why hasn't he
been taught to phrase his lines and pronounce his words
as effectively as he produces his clear, strong voice? Any
capable choir-master could soon coach the lad up in a
pretty rendering of half-a-dozen easy ballads.
The Brothers Fitzgerald had a good time in Ade-
laide with their circus. After the first two nights (which
also showed profitable receipts), the tent was not big
enough to hold the people who desired to get in.
“ Ada Crossley made her first appearance in London
this season,” writes Tue Bulletin's London correspond-
ent, “at a 3 p.m. * morning ’ concert in the Queen’s Hall
to a pressed beef-audience. The occasion was the first
Boosey (capital b, please) ballad concert, and Australia’s
Ada shimmered to the man eye in a pale green concer-
tina-d crbpon, topped with a black hat pasturing more
delicate verdure. Fresh from the Birmingham Festival—
to which she goes next year as also to Leeds—the con-
tralto contralted superbly, but will have to keep going
to hold her own with Clara Butt, whose work in Italy has
much improved her voice. Small hot houses of flowers
were shed upon A.C., for some of which a bearded object
in a red shirt and wearing top-boots with red dust
thereon, a condenser in his hip pocket, and a brass-plate
saying ‘ Mayor of C ,’ was responsible.”
Sold the other day, by order of the N.S.W. Curator of
Intestate Estates, about JE7S worth of jewellery formerly
belonging to “the late Mr. and Mrs. Arthur James ”
otherwise the ill-starred Dacres. Surely this is a ease in
which “No trinkets are the trinkets of the dead” !
S.S. : “ Melbourne is in for another depression. The
Firm puts up its hilarious Xmas panto, in Sydney, and
Wilson Barrett and an imported crowd will lift heavy
masses of melodrama at the Princess. With Plain Bill
Holloway’s small brother at the Royal also hanging out
the same old suffering hero, and the same old villain, and
the old familiar ‘ papers,’ the Smellville digestion will
have no assistance in its struggles with the damp, un-
wholesome duff of Merry Xmas. The management which
offers patrons melodrama on the top of cold, boiled duff at
Yulelide has no conscience and no human sympathies,
and Rickards will probably have the cream of the busi-
ness with his frivolous variety-show. I have a theory
that melodrama should never be produced in Australia
duringsum mer.”
The Bulletin has received extracts from Dutch papers
commenting very favorably upon Lalla Miranda’s appear-
ance, at the Hague Court, Theatre, as the Queen, in “ Les
Huguenots.” She is credited with an excellent voice and
method, and has predicted for her a distinguished future,
when she shall have developed more passion and become
more familiar with the operatic stage.
“ Edison’s phonograph,” writes a Melbourne correspon-
dent, “is about to boom again in the form of the Berliner
Gramophone, a little box of clockwork with an ear-
trumpet arrangement attached. 1 found the ‘ Gram ’
working in Melbourne the other day at the warehouse of
a musical-instrument importer (A. P. Svkes), who has the
Victorian agency for this droll article. It is so easilv
' worked that a child could run it as a show. A thin cir-
cular ‘recorder’ (of black wood or vulcanite), 7in. in
diameter, and holed in the centre, is slipped on to a steel
pivot at the top of the box. Then the sound trumpet is
fixed in position, you turn a handle at the side of the
box, the ‘ recorder’whirls around, and the Gramophone
talks, sings, or plays a full brass band with much better
effect than the original phonograph was capable of pro-
ducing. Half-a-dozen ‘recorders’ amount to a ‘well-
selected programme for balf-an-hour of drawing-room
entertainment. The dialogue pieces are good specimens
of American humor. You get the eloquent speech (with
natural voice inflections) of the travelling vendor of a
certain cure for rheumatism at 25 cents per bottle, and
you listen with awe to his story of the old lady, aged 115
who, after being bedridden for 17 years, applied haif-a-
bottle of the embrocation to her limbs, and now earns her
own living by dancing in the ballet. The Gramophone
recorders will soon be turned out in an immense
variety, like magic-lantern slides, and when the machine
comes a little cheaper (the present retail price is ten
guineas) it will take the place of the musical-box in all
directions. Such a level-headed showman as Phil Stuart,
lately over from Westralia, is struck on the Gramophone
and intends to go around with it. Philip takes the
religious side of the apparatus quite seriously. I watched
him whilst a rich, full voice was reciting ‘The Lord is
my Shepherd and * Our Father ’ through the trumpet
and his face would have done credit to a bishop.”

more striking in the annals of dramatic success than the
premiere of the ‘ Colleen Bawn ’in London. Mrs. Bouei-
cault, little Agnes Robertson, the ‘ Fairy Star,’ made her
reappearance, under circumstances interesting to the
fashionable world. Before going to America, and while
she was a ward of Mrs. Chas. Kean, she jilted Lord Hope-
toun for Boucicault. v

Evans’s new volume, will shortly be published

ing forward with interest to the appearance of

which, by the way, have already commended
themselves to readers of The Bulletin.
If N.S.W. Minister Just-Ice Gould again
contests Greta electorate, the best proof of his un-
fitness for a seat in Parliament will be The
Bulletin’s pamphlet detailing his callous obsti-
nacy in the Sufiield case. When every Greta
elector has marked and digested that pamphlet,
the narrow little lawyer will never again shed a
frozen smile over the Treasury benches.
The art of the log-roller ! Hall Caine
notified Dr. Parker that he was going to publish a
religious novel. Presently Parker preached on
“ The Christian ”at the City Temple. Mr. Caine
at once telegraphed to the Daily Chronicle word
of the fact, and added : “I should be profoundly
grateful if you could give a report.” The
Chronicle complied, but cruelly printed Mr.
Hall Caine’s telegram.
One thing : no matter whether he gets out
of gaol this year or nex£, Sufiield will not have
suffered in vain. The impression which his case
has burnt into the public mind will for a while
make it morally impossible for any N.S.W. jury,
at all events, to convict a man upon ludicrously-
insufficient evidence such as was found sufficient to
convict Suffield.
Corner Man : “Jack Murray, if he misses
the Vic. Assembly Chairmanship of Committees,
will do so because of his habit of guying his part,
as they say on the stage. The misfortune is, the
legislators will have it, that this really able man
is successor to the fatuous Jack Gardiner, of
‘Sugar, as it were,’ fame, as clown to the arena.
He is like the comedian who gets a laugh when
his voice is heard at the wing.”
What on earth does Rockhampton (C.Q.)
Record, (edited by the virtuous C. H. Buzacott,
M.L.C.) mean by this ?
There are things which cannot be spoken about in the
public press and such are the sinister rumors which are
continually coming to hand of late from the South touch-
ing certain proceedings in high life. We should rejoice
to be assured that these rumors are baseless, for they tend
to sap the very foundations of loyalty among the humbler
classes of the community, whatever effects they may have
upon polite society. One thing is quite certain, which is
that,there is no person in Australia so distinguished, or
so highly placed, as to be able to defy the moral law with
impunity. The materials for a “Nonconformist con-
science” mav yet he found among the undeveloped
resources of Queensland.

The WILD CAT COLUMN
Last year S.A. had a surplus of =£2l4o—not
very much for a country which has ±‘1,254,000 of old
deficits to wipe off ; but the Government was so inflated
about it that it made some small reductions in taxation.
After making these the next surplus, at 30th June, 1898,
was estimated at rather below ±2OOO. At the time Tub
Bulletin said that the Kingston-Holder Government was
a miserably improvident fool for sacrificing revenue at
such a time—and the event has proved it. The drought
has knocked Holder’s estimates endways ; the revenue is
already £20,000 less than it should be, and there are eight
bad months ahead, and all is chaos. The finances of S.A.
are hideously mismanaged at all times. Like N.S.W., it
lives by charging current expenditure to loan funds, and
it doesn’t so much as make an effort, as N.S.W. and
Victoria and even Tasmania do, to pay off any of its huge
shortage. And yet the Kingston Government is reckoned
moderately honest as compared with some of its prede-
cessors.
• • • •
The Kingston (S.A.) Government has ideas
about introducing a State Fire Insurance Bill next session
—insurance to be compulsory. A Government which
believes in taxing the absentee can hardly do otherwise —
the British insurance ring is about the biggest and most
expensive absentee in these provinces. All the trouble
about increased premiums arises from the fact that there
are far too many companies—mostly English—trying to
live on the business, so that half the premiums go in
expenses, through the vast multiplicity of officers, and
staffs, and managements. A State Department should he
able to cut the expenses down 60 per cent., and then even
the present rates would yield a handsome profit. Even
in little Adelaide there are 36 companies doing business,
and 36 managements trying to live on the little scrap of
local trade.

The Provident and Industrial Insurance Co.
(Maoriland), one of the curious little proprietary life in-
surance companies which have begun to spring up of late
years, issues its eighth balance-sheet for the 12 months
ending 30th June. During that period it gathered in
£6485 in premiums, mostly on the industrial principle,
The expenses were ±'4495, equal to 69 per cent, of the pre-
miums, and in spite of this atrocious figure the report
makes some congratulatory remarks about the cheapness
with which the society is worked. Yet in reality it seems
to be worked even a great deal more expensively than
appears on the surface. During 1896 it seems to have
spent over £lOOO in extending the business, and this item
of expense, instead of being put bodily among the ex-
penses, where it belongs, has been made a suspense
account to be wiped off by instalments spread over
a large number of years. In 1897 it seems to have
expended over ±2OBO the same way, and £1465 of this is
made a suspense account and not charged against the
year’s expenses. At some other date it appears to have
spent another large sum in the ordinary work of estab-
lishing new agencies, and £1163 of this, instead of being
charged to immediateex.’s.is carried forward as asuspense
account. Apparently, if each year had been charged
with the money which actually went out in expenses,
the ex.’s for 1897 would have been about £5727—t0 col-
lect £6485 in premiums.
The Provident and Industrial claims to have
accumulated an assurance fund of only £3054 in eight
years. Against this is the alleged asset, £3562, money
spent in the extension of the business and establishment of
agencies, and not yet charged to expenses, so in reality, as
far as can be gathered from the balance-sheet, it has no
assurance fund—not one single penny—and has spent at
least £5OO of the shareholders’ capital as well. The total
paid-up capital is just £4875, which is a large and beauti-
ful security for policy holders. There is also an item
among the liabilities, “ Advance account, £3320,” about
which the writer can form no theory unless it is money
borrowed from somebody to keep things going. During
the year the funds are alleged to have increased from
£6443 to £7213, an increase of £770 —£477 by calls and
forfeiture of shares, and £293 saved out of a
premium income of £6485. In reality, owing to
the suspense account arrangement, the funds actually
on hand seem to have decreased some £460. The paid-
up capital is set down as £4875, and assuranoe
fund as £3os4—total, £7929. Yet the total funds are
alleged, in the revenue account, to be only £7213. The
interest received (apparently on £5OOO which the co. has
at fixed deposit) is set down as ±168; and the interest
paid (the writer presumes upon the £3320 “ advance
account,” which is apparently money borrowed some-
where, and on £3oodescribed as “deposit ")appears to be
£232. This represents a heavy loss, and looks like very
expensive borrowing. There is no cash at head office and
no bank balance mentioned among the assets—apparently
the co. hasn’t any. It would be interesting to know’ how
far the Provident and Industrial reckons the process of
putting expenses among the assets can be safely
carried. So far as things can be sorted out from the
balance-sheet, it is a strange and awful concern, and the
news that the shareholders have just taken their usual 5
per cent, dividend is very interesting. Isn’t it about time
that Maoriland led the way with a law for the State super-
vision of insurance companies ?
* » * *
An arrangement is announced as being in pro-
gress whereby the Cit.v Mutual Fire Insurance Co. will be
bought up by a Biitish office—the London and Lan-
cashire. If the deal comes off, which seems almost cer-
tain, there will be only four Cornstalk fire insurance
offices left in existence. Nine years ago there were
eleven, but the British offices have eaten up most of
the other seven, and those which were not eaten
up bv the ever-encroaching Bull have, as a rule, been
killed off by Bull competition. Victoria has seven offices
now, whereas it had nine in 1888, so it has held its owm
better than N.S.W. South Australia has one company
left, against four in 1888. And Tiie Bulletin still wants
to know—it has been wanting to know the same thing for
a number of years now—when some of the Protectionist
provinces will start protecting the local fire insurance
industry, which seems threatened with extinction ? It is
a vastly larger and more important industry than a good
many others which are carefully fostered by tariffs, and
the utter neglect with which it is treated is inexplicable.

That quaint little concern, the Tasmanian Per-
manent Executors and Trustees Association, has a half-
year’s profit of £264, against £237 at 30th March ; ±ll7 at
Sept., ’96; and £494 at March, ’96. The usual 5 per cent.
dividend is paid (£262), leaving: £2 to strengthen the
institution. This concern has led a harmless existence
at Launceston for 10 years, and has accumulated £405 in
all agrainst a possible rainy day. Eighteen months ago it
fell into a state of riotous affluence, and had a total
reserve of £574, but since then it has paid away consider-
ably more in dividends than it earned, with the above
painful result.

The ruins of the once great and prosperous St.
James’s Building Society, Melbourne —no financial insti-
tution should ever be run in the name of any saint: look
at St. Joseph, in Sydney, too ! —issue a cheerless statement
of affairs. The paper assets amount to £262,592, of which
£118,980 are accumulated losses, and the remaining
£143,612 consist of more-or-less realisable properties
£117,000 being foreclosed mortgagees of uncertain value.
Still, the St. James isn’t in a very bad way as some build-
ing societies go now. The amount owing to depositors
is only £45,574, so they should be paid in full, and there
may even be a dividend left for the shareholders after-
wards. It all depends on whether the depositors can be
repaid before the ever-accumulating loss has swallowed
everything up. In fact, it is a race between the accumu-
lated loss and the depositors. Last year, the depositors
got £43,000 and loss swallowed up £39,000, so the former
had slightly the best of it.
* * * •
The Colonial Permanent Building and Invest-
ment Society (Melb.) having lost £920 for the past year
and £823 in ’96, and £l5Ol in ’95, proposes making the
usual appeal to its depositors for a reduction of interest.

Horace Tozer defends the action of Premier
Nelson and his colleague, Barlow, in declaring, in 1893,
that the Q.N. Bank was quite sound, whereas it was bank-
rupt to the extent of some £2,000,000, on the ground
that their estimate of the value of the securities only
differed from that of the present committee by 2s. 9d. in
the £. Which looks very convincing. Also, if Nelson
and Barlow bad gone to inspect 8000 men, and reported
that they were all alive and well, whereas 1000 of them
were dead of cholera, that mistake would only be equal to
2s. 6d. in the £. And 2s. 6d. in the £is even less than
2s. 9d. Besides, the Nelson and Barlow estimate was out
by nearly 7s. in the £, not 2s. 9d.

It is interesting to note that the first and only-
audit which revealed the fact that there was anything
wrong with the Queensland National Bank was a State
audit. The private audit kept its filmy eye on the insti-
tution for over 30 years, and never saw anything. The
Fat person who always rises to point out the uselessness
of Stale audits will please note.

Ricardo: “Wild horses cannot drag auditors
into auditing. It is a purely stage business, just like the
Dramatic Banker, who hands over a sheaf of securities
with the remark, ‘These represent a miilion of money.’
Auditors complain that they are not sufficiently paid to
make a real audit. That is one thing. Another is that
they are apt to be an inferior class, like schoolmasters,
and quail before the mighty Gorgio Midas, who really
appoints them and is, besides, mixed up with them in
other ways, and puts a lot of business snacks in their
road. What private auditor, for instance, in a small
town like Brisbane could have offended MTlwraith in the
day of his glory, when he had a hand in everything,
without being ruined?”
* * * *
The North Queensland Insurance Co. publishes
a balance-sheet for the year ended 30th September, which
is decidedly its best up to date. Gross premiums
(‘102,014) are £20,000 more than last year. Net premiums
(after allowing for returns and reinsurances), are £15,000
more. On the other hand, losses (£30,239) have only in-
creased by >6OO, and working-expenses have actually
diminished by £230, despite the increase of business.
The only place where the balance-sheet doesn’t seem to
be feeling quite well is in the item “commission, rent,
and interest.” The receipts under this head havedropped
from £5781 to £3084, which is a considerable drop, and,
as it is impossible to tell how much is commission and
how much is rent and interest, it is difficult to estimate
how the investments are paying. Anyhow, the year's
profit is £10,688, whereas last year there was a loss of
£776, and the profit for 1895 was only £3113. A 6 per
cent, dividend (£3206) is declared ; £5OOO is added to re-
serve-fund, making it £15,000, and there remains a
balance of £1982 at credit of profit and loss. Taking it
all round,'the North Queensland Insurance Co. looks re-
markably well this year.

The insurances on the properties damaged by
the great Melbourne fire are set down at £700,500. Of
this amount, British offices hold £488,500 ; other foreign
ones, £25,000-; and those of all the seven Australasian
provinces have about £187,000 among them. The local
offices, to all intents and purposes, only get the fire-
insurance business that the blessed Bull doesn’t want.
And by-and-bye Bull will want it all.
* • * *
You cannot persuade Melbourne people to re-
gard the great fire as a catastrophe. The writer has met
no insurance-people, but everybody else he has hit
against has taken quite a cheerful view of the ruin.
In “the Lane” on Sunday morning owners approached
each other, clasped hands, and remarked, with quite a
praiseworthy attempt at due solemnity : “ Bad business
this, old man. Awfully sorry for you, you know.”
“ Dreadful, isn’t it ? ” would he the reply. “ Hope you’ll
pull through all right.” But there was a twinkle in each
eye, and a merry little curl of the lip that belied the
speakers. Even the work-people temporarily suspended
are singularly optimistic, a fact due to the liberality of
many of the burnt-out owners in generously conceding
full pay pending the renewal of operations.
* * * *
Two Australian fire insurance go’s have al-
ready had to make calls in view of losses on the Melbourne
fire. Another co. has had to realise the whole of its liquid
securities, and the hanking facilities of still another will
be fully tested to meet engagements. It will take several
years’ profit! to make good the losses of two Victorian
co's, and it is quite on the cards that one concern in-
terested won't pull through.

The City Mutual (Sydney) declined heavy busi-

Coincidences : —The big Melbourne fire of last
week occurred on the first anniversary of the last big
softgoods fire in Melbourne, and the Melbourne fire was on
at the same time as the big blaze in London. Paterson,
Laing and Bruce’s London and Melbourne premises were
within a few yards of the fires, and both escaped.

Alleged that one big bung-bank account —
which began with a dr. entry for a eheque-book and
ran into many thousands, all afterwards written off
as value'ess—was that of a prominent of the
bank, who afterwards was given his discharge with a big
douceur to sweeten it. He got to know too much—was
allowed a share—wanted too much -could be done with-
out—and was done without. He also is “a gentleman
who is away,” or his evidence might have been interesting.
The Bulletin’s Brisbane agent informs it that
he sent, an advt. to the local Telegraph inviting public
attention to this paper’s comments on theQ.N. Bank re-
port. The advt. was returned to him by a clerk, who said
that “Mr. Oowlishaw would not allow it to be inserted.”

Ed. Bulletin,—Here is a sample of N.S.W.
mining law as served out by Warden Clarke at Wyalong
and Yalgogrin. A syndicate applies for suspension of
labor-conditions on a 10-acre lease on private property at
Yalgogrin, on the ground that they are spending money
and employing nine men on other leases, also the pro-
perty of the syndicate, but not adjoining the lease for
which suspension is asked (these nine men being sufficient
to represent the whole of the leases held by the syndicate
if two men were put to work on each 10-acre block). The
application was opposed by an adjoining party, but appli-
cants were granted three months’ suspension for the lease
—on which they never did an hour’s work. The inference
to be drawn from this decision is that as it only takes
two men to represent 10 acres on private property, any-
one can take up 10a. of private property for gold-mining
purposes in Gundagai and another 10a. in Wilcannia, and,
so long as four men are kept working at Gundagai, sus-
pension can be obtained for the Wilcannia property ad in-
finitum. And that, of course, is the way to do away
with monopoly.—Miner, Yalgogrin.

Mt. David--an over-boomed N.S.W. mine—
“ 670 z. gold from 250 tons, of which the first 150 tons was
composed principally of mullock, the balance being
quartz. Did not retort the silver, nor could get all the
gold off the plates without injuring them, and think it a
fair estimate to say there are about 20oz. of gold on the
plates and in the silver.” N.S.W. gold-mining to the
letter. How often ore turns into mullock—after the
crushing? The plates, too, usually carry the burden. A
man who reported like this in Bendigo or Ballarat would
keep the whole populace up at night, laughing. “ Did
not retort the silver.” The writer would bet that it does
not contain 3oz. ! The cruel facts, however, remain : they
are briefly—mine purchased for £ll,OOO cash, and the
balance up to fully £20,000 spent on machinery and mine.
Big reef, given out to he worth an oz. from end to end.
Ten heads running and 20 more going up. Insinuation
that the best part of the ore chute was gouged by the
original owner declared to be a libel on a big mine. ’ First
crushing, sdwts.; and the awful slump in the shares shows
that the poor shareholders are not taking any mullock,
and they are more depressed by the very small cake on
their own plate than consoled with that left on the bat-
tery plates. Let us pra t v—for the next crushing. Share-
holders now asked to sigm a requisition expressing want
of confidence in the management.

Sydney Harbor Collieries’ London chairman :
“ You are aware that coal has been found in Kent, and
it has created a sensation in London. We, in the course
of a very short time, are likely to create a somewhat
greater sensation in Sydney, if we have not done so
already.” His idea of a very short time was given in
reply to questions—“ It would take a good deal of
honest work to get down by Christmas two years. The
total distance to be sunk was 2900 ft., and their colliery
would be practically the deepest in the world. The con-
tractor was bound to complete in about two and a half
years from the present time.” The optimistic chairman
proceeded to show what a fine thing it would be when
they got to working the coal, and what a fine specimen of
“ nice bituminous and splint coal” had been taken out of
the bore-hole. “So far, they had travelled down without
any difficulty whatever”—lsoft. below sea-level. Nothing
seems to have been said of the very poor—indeed value-
less-sample of coal got out of the first bore put down, or
of the fact that only two bores have been put down alto-
gether, and that sufficient time has since elapsed to have
got a dozen down. Now, if good coal had been pene-
trated in other bores on the co.’s ground, there would be
every encouragement to pay calls, of which over ±20,000
are now said to be owing, whereas if boring didn’t show a
dead certainty the co. could save a quarter-of-a-million
by shutting down altogether. The Harbor Collieries
business may turn out all right, but it has unnecessarily
been made into a tremendous gamble.

Newbridge mine, N.S.W.—“ Stone prospects

Pambula, N.S.W.—“ThePambula Gold-mines
co. has struck what promises to be payable stone ;
assaying 15dwt. from a width of 3ft. The co’s battery
and cyanide plant are nearing completion, and when
finished will treat stone for the public.” This English
co. had a prospectus that cartainlv did not insinuate
it would spend a lot of money before it found payable
ore, and that when the plant was up it would be engaged
in treating ore from the other fellow’s mine ! If this par.
is resented, as others have been, Tub Bulletin will give a
hunk from said prospectus.

Another hugely-boomed mine, the Birthday,
Parkes (N.S.W.)—“Cleaned up 120 tons (seconds) for
480 z.” Well, if so what has become of the firsts? Also,
why on earth doesn’t this ten-head mill crush twice as
much dirt? “ What have you done with the ‘firsts'?”
asked the writer of one N.S.W. mine-manager, who re-
plied with a wink, “ We only have ‘ seconds ’ 1 ”

Northern Territory Times reports the dis-
covery in the Brock’s Creek Co. mine of a 2ft. reef with
well-defined black slate walls. One authority estimates
the crushing stuff to be worth soz. free gold per ton, with
perhaps another 2oz. or 3oz. per ton to be obtained by
other treatment. “All who have seen it regard it as one
of the richest strikes they have met for a very long time.”

Last week an exploring-party started quietly
from Adelaide for Central Australia. Object, to look for
gold, and the syndicate running it is one which is reputed
to have made a bit out of Westralia. The party numbers
seven and is in charge of Allan A. Davidson, a smart
young mining engineer well known at Kalgoorlie in con-
nection with tellurides discovery, and just returned
from a tour in Papua for the' same syndicate—who
“have secured a concession of 8000 sq. miles of country on
and around 17° S. Lat. from the S.A. Govt., and this is to
be prospected for all its worth.”

In the Towers Warden’s-court recently,
“ Johnny Clark ” sought to obtain an order, on behalf of
Clark's Worcester and Victory co., to compel the Victory
co. to allow him to survey the latter's workings trending
in the Worcester direction. Victory co. opposed the ap-
plication, alleging that Clark’s co. desired the survey in
order to boom shares, as (it was further alleged) ‘had
been done before; application refused. White, the Vic-
tory mining-surveyor, stated in evidence that work in the
levels going towards Clark’s ground had been stopped
owing to want of reef, no ore showing in the faces, but
the Victory people refused to allow Johnny to verify—or
disprove this allegation. How the opposition crowd
does hate Johnny Clark !

Some Charters Towers items: Papuans, after
their recent slump, were stationary at latest advices at
buyers about 12s. 6d, with sellers (say) sd. higher. Haul-
aye for fortnight ended 13th Nov., 250 tons. Rough

Worcester, at latest reports, had dropped to 45 tons.
Brilliant declared its usual monthly div. on the 18th of

A private co. offers to build a railway from
Mareeba to Chillagoe copper-mine, N.Q. (95 miles). It is
to be built entirely free of cost to Govt.—no grants of
alternate blocks of land —merely the right of road is re-
quired and security for 50 years. Object: Development

The angry waves of railway gridiron syndicates
have somewhat subsided in Van Dobson land, but occa-
sional seas still rise. The other day, Ronald Smith,
member for Launceston, felt himself hurt by the way the
Mercury had reported him. In return, he moved that
the Governor be petitioned to appropriate £lOOO to pur-
chase certain agricultural sections—named—on the
Rasselas overland route to the West. As it turns out,
these sections belong' to editor Nichols, of the Mercury.
Needless to add, this motion, though appearing in the
Parliamentary papers, wasn’t noticed bv the dailies. The
Mercury is the greatest champion of the Great Western
Grab Railway.

The West Coast of Tasmania is still booming in
a mild degree, but, up to the present, there are few pro-
perties that have sufficient capital behind them to work
to the end. The Rosebery is said to be financially Al,
but the ore is very dirty, and the writer is afraid that
there are snags ahead. The Colebrook is in the hands of
Schlapp and co., and ought to be all right as regards
funds. The Hercules, a zinciferous show, has about
- 25,000 a drop on a hot stone with so big' a property.
Mt. Reid isn’t taking any at present—at least, not since
Col. Kitchener left. Other shows boomed largely' of late
represent mineralised schist formations, that may be any-
thing, but not copper-mines. There is a good deal of ore
coming forward from various sources. It is mostly mined
by tributors, and most of the shows want a good deal of
work before they can lay claim to the title of mine.

because it lcoks as if the exploiters were nursing’ the

Dear Bulletin, —You sav you have yet received
nothing authentic re Mt. Deddiek. This is authentic.
The Mt. Deddiek co. property is located on the Snowy
River about 30 odd miles higher up, and on the opposite
the river to the—er—Buchan mines lately managed
by Col. Morgan. The existence of these allegedly' rich
silver lodes has been known for, I believe, over tw'enty
years, but save a few surface trenches from which in-
numerable assays were taken nothing was done to test
their value till their acquisition by the present co.
about 18 months ago, when the lode now known as the
Mt. Deddiek was taken up. The first prospectus issued
described the lode as an immense formation 120yds. wide.
Samples of galena ore taken across and along the lode
from the surface assayed 60 per cent. lead and from 20 to
30oz. silver per ton. 1500 shares were issued at £5, of
which I believe vendors received half (this is from
memory). Since then the co. has acquired three or four
more blocks from James Bros., on which several lodes
have been found. Shortly after the formation of the
above co. I went up to see a large property adjoining,
through which this large Deddiek lode was supposed to
run-in fact, could be easily traced for miles, but I found
on arrival that this immense lode existed principally' in
the imagination of the interested parties. I examined the
Deddiek lode, but could see nothing of such huge propor-
tions There was a lode certainly about eight or nine
feet wide, composed of a gossany quartz with a vein of
galena ore from two or three up to nine inches thick on
one wall, but as there was not more than half-a-dozen
cuts on it and these only three or four feet deep it was
hard to judge what the thing would be like lower down
The Snowy River cuts the lode a few hundred feet from
the cuts mentioned ; the appearance of the lode there
was certainly not encouraging; the rock (granite) en-
closing it was as hard as the hobs of Gehenna, and the
galena vein could only be discovered by the aid of a
powerful glass. The lodes on James’ blocks were similar
in appearance, but perhaps a foot or two wider. Since
then (ride reports) the deepest shaft sunk is only 50ft.,
and, as far as can be learned, the work has been
confined principally to James’ blocks, the immense
formation hardly ever being mentioned (50ft. isn’t
much to sink in nearly 18 months). According to esti-
mates furnished, the cost of carting and packing would
be about £7 10s. per ton to Cunningham. The Govt,
geologist, after examination of the field, wound up a long
report by saying that he did not consider that anything
so far discovered was of a payable nature, but further
prospecting, &c., &c. Since then the reports have mostly
been furnished by more or less interested parties. How-
ever, it is always possible that in such a vast belt of
mineral country some things will pav to work. In fact
half-way between Deddiek and Buchan there are several
lodes up to 15ft. or so in width composed of a pvricous
quartz that seems well worth prospecting, as both assays
and surface appearance are highly encouraging. I don’t
like the Deddiek lodes, although I may be altogether
wrong re their value; still I have met several men well
qualified to express an opinion, who have been there since
my visit and entirely agree with me on the subject

A London syndicate offered .£130,600 spot cash
for the Great Southern Garden Gully, Bendigo, but Geo.
Lansell, the biggest holder, says no. There are only
33, 1 50 shares in the co. —which probably accounts for
some of its success. Anyway, more than a few' moderately
successful Bendigo mines would have collapsed long ago
if they had been burdened at the outset with the weight
of capital attached to the average Anglo-Australian co.
The Garden Gully offer came through H. S. Bussfc, the
local mining registrar, through whom the syndicate is
nibbling after one or tw'o other Bendigo mines.

Although the English cricketers appeared
duly to appreciate the sentiment of the legend,
“ New England Welcomes Old England,” placed
over Glen Innes cricket-ground entrance, it is a
surprising fact (writes a Bulletin correspondent)
that at the ball given in the evening “ the dis-
tinguished visitors refused to take part in the
dancing, and declined to be introduced to any of
the ladies present. The Glen Innes people are
comparing this conduct with that of Gov. Hamp-
den, who, when he visited the district about a
year ago, not only attended with a large party the
ball given in his honor, but took part in the danc-
ing, and made himself agreeable in every possible
way. Stoddart, Ranji and co., however, remained
but a short time, and then retired to their respec-
tive hotels. The natural result of which was
that the departure of these great potentates was in
striking contrast to the reception, and presented a
clear case of no ‘bawl.’ It is the first time an
English cricketing-team has visited the locality,

“Oh, rather; he kissed her in the dark last night and called her ‘Mary."'

last.” Surely there must be another side to this
story !

One of the results of the hot weather. One
day last week the writer saw a cab with a lady in

The driver got down, and brought out from the

with a bloated yellow head on it, and handed it
to his passenger. She blew the froth on to the
horse, and drank the beer down in two gulps, and
then the driver returned the glass, and drove off

The successful sale of the Brennan torpedo
in England has given so great an impetus to Aus-

new torpedoes—all Australian —have been sub-

writer's says that the officials of the submarine
engineering department are so full up of Austra-
lian torpedo specifications and models that only
inventors who don’t value their lives should risk
interviewing the department as Australians, or
with anything that looks like a torpedo or specifi-
cation of one.

the statement that he intends an early with-

The population of Lane’s Cosm6 colony is

young professional man is named as a co-respon-

into the case, he decided to go round and take it
out of respondent’s hide, said respondent being a
very little chap, at one time a very fair amateur
jockey. He, however, “struck a snag’’ in the
diminutive respondent aforesaid, who made things
very “ willing,’’and, a little later, a bruised and
battered lawyer was bundled into a cab and sent

Hev. Rentoul, of Melb., accuses the
Argus of persistently assailing all that Presby-
terians love and honor. This isn’t quite true.
The Presbyterian, as a rule (the exception should
be in a dime museum), loves money, and the
Argus is the organ of capital. Fat Man supports
the Argus, and Fat Man supports the kirk.
You’ll see more fine carriages outside the temples
of Calvin, on Sawbath mornings, than at any other
gospel shop. The Argus’s one standard of merit
is the bank-balance, and the kirk loves also the
elder of the bank-balance. For him it preaches,
expounds, saves and damns. It lives for him’
and the thing he symbolises. Wherefore the
Argus and the kirk row in the one boat, and
Rentoul is, so far, wrong. But, then, Rentoul is
Irish, and as illogical as a shillelagh.

H. : “Story given as true by a Melb.
detective. A fat, white-waistcoated gentleman
was talking to a woman under the electric-light
at a street corner when he laid hands on her, and
said she had picked his vest-fob of a <£s-note.
Policeman came up and laid hold of her, too. He
said it would be a simple matter to search her at
the lock-up, because she could have thrown noth-
ing away. The female-searcher ransacked her,
but found nothing. A week afterwards she
admitted to the policeman she had stolen the r te,
and pleaded to be allowed to return it by thrust-
ing it under the cuff of his great-coat while he
looked the other way. He agreed. When she
had gone he could not find the note. She had
slipped it under his cuff the former night, and
now took it out.”

Sleath, the heavy bore of N.S.W. As-
sembly, when the military estimates were on,
cracked hideous jokes at the expense of Majah
Neild and other amateur Bonapartes. The Majah
now wears a sort of undress military costume in
the House, and forms himself into a hollow square
in his dreams, and performs deep military strategy
with the loaf at breakfast, so he is regarded as
fair game. Sleath jokes more like an armoured
elephant than anything else, but the painful
writhings of his victim lent point to his observa-
tions :
They might as well enroll some of the stray dogs in
Centennial Park. . . He found George Dibbs, and
about nine of the National Guard, and a little chap about
3ft, high, and a drill-instructor performing some marvel-
lous evolutions in Macquarie-street. Fifty or sixty news-
paper boys were assembled and saying, “ Oh, mister, lift
the other foot first,” and people had their windows and
doors open, and it was a kind of a circus. George Dibbs
was calmly smoking a cigar on the pavement and swore
occasionally at the little fellow because he didn’t give the
word of command soon enough, or gave it too soon. . .
One fellow would trip over the kerb on the off-side. Then
“ right-wheel ” was given, and the chap on the other side
would fall over the kerb. . . The St. George’s Rifles.
The only man enrolled for some months was the hon.
gentleman (Neild) himself. . . He was created a major
by accident a night or two before he left for England, and
the whole of his regiment consisted of himself. . . We
ought not to dress up a few old men in ridiculous uni-
forms and send them out to be a laughing-stock. . .
He saw his hon. friend, Lieut.-Colonel Neild, at the
Agricultural Ground, the other day. His spurs were 1-sin.
longer than those of anybody else. He was stuck where
every trooper had to salute him about twice in five
minutes. . . Would he have been so cool and collected
with bullets whizzing about his ears?
The obvious answer to that was that the only
time Sleath was under fire he fought a disorderly
campaign with a chair and the other man with a
ruler, and Sleath, as a badly-defeated warrior,
wasn’t qualified to criticise anybody’s military
tactics. But Neild missed the point.

carrying round the plate, which he accordingly
does. But his enemies in the congregation indi-

their “threepences” and sixpences in a sealed

finished the plate is a pyramid of envelopes.

A Modern Buccaneer.
Mr. R. C. Burt writes The Bulletin from Melb.
on 24th Nov. :
While in New York, connected with the Sun, I did
some w'ork for the Book Buyer, a monthly literary maga-
zine published by Scribner’s. Among the pars. I wrote
was one about the Boldrewood-Becke matter as I under-
stood it. This par. was quoted in the Evening Sun with
a contradiction or correction said to be inspired by one
Wagner. The editor of the Book Buyer is anxious to
know which is right. I enclose the clipping from the
Evening Sun, and would be exceedingly obliged if you
could let me know whether Wagner’s or my version of the
affair is the correct one.
The following is the clipping from the Evening
Sun referred :
The Book Buyer of this month contains the following :
A year or two ago Rolf Boldrewood published a book
called “ A Bold Buccaneer.” It may not be known in
America—as it is now pretty well known in Australia—
that the material of the story really belonged to Louis
Becke, whose tales of the South Seas have since made
him famous. Becke was a guest at Boldrewood’s house
once or twice before he took to writing, and he supplied
the whole of the plot which Boldrewood used, without
acknowledgment at the time. The facts became known
in Australia, and since then Boldrewood has freely
admitted his indebtedness to Becke. The picture pre-
sented herewith is, we believe, the only portrait ever pub-
lished of Rolf Boldrewood.
[This statement is not correct. What happened was as
follows While Becke was staying at the house of
“ Boldrewood ” (T. A. Browne) the latter was engaged on
a story about the islands, and Becke sold to his host a
notebook containing a number of jottings for a fixed sum
of money, with the understanding that they were to be
used for purposes of reference. They were so utilised.
When the report that “ Boldrewood” had made a wrong
use of the materials was first started the whole matter
was fully explained to the satisfaction of everybody. The
best proof of this lies in the fact that Becke did not inter-
fere in the momentary controversy, for a very simple
reason. It had been a simple commercial transaction.
It is just as absurd to make this charge against “ Boldre-
wood ” as it would be to accuse the Hon. Andrew D.
White of impropriety in using in his historical writings
material which had been worked up by young men em-
ployed by him for the purpose. “ Rolf Boldrewood ”
enjoys with all who know him the reputation of an
honorable man, both as a magistrate and a writer.]
In response to Mr. Burt’s request, and as a matter
of Australian literary interest, The Bulletin
shortly repeats the facts as related in its issues of
Sept. 1 and 8, 1894. The Book Buyer’s para-
graph is essentially true ; the Sun’s statement is
essentially false. Becke didn’t sell “ a note-book
containing a number of jottings”; he sold the
actual book of “ A Modern Buccaneer”— i.e., all
that really makes “A Modern Buccaneer” worth
reading. Becke was unknown and hard-up, and
Mr. T. A. Browne bought the MS. of his story for
<£2s or £3O. “ A Modern Buccaneer ” was first
published in three volumes. Becke’s narrative,
with style and matter substantially unchanged,
occupies nearly the whole of the first two volumes
in the three-volume edition, and some 200 pages
out of 368 in the one-volume edition. What
“ Boldrewood ” chiefly did was to pad out Becke’s
story to conventional three-volume length by the
addition of incongruous matter in his dullest
style. Then Mr. Browne published the book as
his o vn—“ A Modern Buccaneer, by Rolf Boldre-
wood ’’—and when the fact of Becke’s author-
ship leaked Out —Becke’s “ Reef and Palm ” stories
were then appearing in The Bulletin —Mr.
Browne advertised in the Sydney papers of Aug.
15 and 16, 1894, this acknowledgment:—
TO THE EDITOR OF THE SYDNEY MORN-
ING HERALD.
Dear Sir, —I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness to
Mr. Louis Becke, author of “ By Reef arid Palm,” for the
South Sea Island portion of “ A Modern Buccaneer,” ex-
cepting the chapter headed “ Poisoned Arrows,” which
was founded on a diary of a whaling cruise by my late
father.
T. A. BROWNE.
Albury, 13th August, 1894.
And “the South Sea Island portion of ‘A Modern
Buccaneer ’ ” is all that makes the book worth
reading. Becke’s matter was not used, as the
Sun says, “ for purposes of reference.” His actual-
narrative was printed, with some editorial al-
teration, as “by Rolf Boldrewood.” Mr.
Browne, who is no authority on the South Seas,
was anyhow not competent to otherwise alter
it. The matter was never explained “to the
satisfaction of everybody ” —it left an ugly blot
on “ Rolf Boldrewood’s” literary reputation. And
the Andrew D. White case isn’t in the same
street. Andrew D. White didn’t take another
man’s gist-of-a novel and affix his name
to it while suppressing the other fellow’s—ap-
parently permitting the public to give him credit
for the other fellow’s brains and brain-sweat.
The transaction would have been perfectly
fair had Mr. Browne pointed out its nature on his
title-page, or in a preface, and given Becke his
proper credit. As he didn’t—well, the transaction
smelt—and it smells still. Mr. Browne’s “ acknow-
ledgment ” is forgotten in the files of a three-
year-old newspaper ; but “A Modern Buccaneer ”
is still sold as “ by Rolf Boldrewood,” without a
word of reference to Becke’s authorship; and
persons ignorant of the facts are thereby deceived.
Yet to paste-in an acknowledgment-slip would
have meant very little trouble and expense. Mr.
Browne’s conduct in allowing the book to be still
sold as his own sole and original work is, pre-
suming that he can prevent it, in the highest
degree unsatisfactory.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, November 30, 1897.
Mi Dear Mtee—
One of the liveliest accounts of the defuhct
Jubilee and some of the littlenesses hanging on
to that great occasion, is given by a Sydney ladv,
who with her family has lately returned from
’Ome. The lady chats amusingly on the weird
capers cut by some of the Australians at ’Oiiie,
and the magnificence of the Cecil inmates, who
were driven all around London by a hastily-
bired staff of menials run into royal livery for the
occasion. In crowded thoroughfares the scarlet
livery on the box of the carriages always attracted
attention, and in a traffic-block the window-
frames would be darkened with faces flattened
against the panes gazing at the presumed
“royalty” lurking within. When a mere “colo-
nial ” stepped forth from thfe gorgeous surround-
ings, it was as great a come-down as when a large
red crayfish drops out of a violin-case with which
a gorgeously-attired, damsel is tripping along the
streets to her “ lesson.” The Mansion House ball
was apparently the great night out for the visitors
-—“Colonials” they were all labelled. As each
batch of arrivals from oversea pranced in the
flunkey shouted their names and addresses, and
onlookers clapped vigorously. About the Fre-
ni ieresses there was whitening of hair among
Colonial Office folk. Most of ’em weren’t dazzling
enough. One of them went to a Duchess’s garden-
party in a green-cloth coat and skirt and a
rumpled blouse. Her Gracious at first turned
up her royal nose at Premiers’wives just as Queen
Bess ignored bishops’ spouses, and for some time
the ladies didn’t exist socially. Later, after much
official coaxing (for when H.M. puts her foot down
the whole household apparently sit back and hold
tight) a grudging invitation to Windsor was given,
and the Matrons of Greater Britain sallied down
to the Castle with vast tomes of addresses, which,
on the get-it-over-and-done-with-it principle, were
taken as read. One of the Premieresses, at a sub-
sequent dinner-party, loudly descanted on the
incident, and patted Queen Victoria affably on
the back. “ Poor dear,” she sighed, “it was such
a relief the addresses were taken as read. One has
so much of that sort of tiresome thing oneself,
opening bazaars and receiving bouquets and all
that.’’
An ’aughty titled Premieress when in Lon-
don delivered a severe snub to a person in the
shipping trade who was introduced to her at some
lordly snivoo. Although from the same province
she seemed as though she had never heard of the
big firm which bears his name. “Surely you
know Mr. Blank,” said the introducer, “hecomes
from the same city as yourself.” “Ah, indeed,”
she sniffed loftily; “what is he—beef or mutton?”
The ladies’ gallery up at the House has always
a fair sprinkling of occupants. Politics jumped
into popularity with Federation. Before the
Convention only suffragers and other women with
a little axe to grind were to be seen sitting aloft;
but now the fashionable and frivolous are gathered
there. The door-attendant’s face is pervaded with
smiles whenever he sees ladies coming. He seems
to take their arrival as a personal compliment, and
bustles round courteously to find room. In a
women’s Parliament he would be an ideal door-
keeper. Debates are generally dull, and the most
absorbing thing to do is to criticise hon. members’
tailors. Summed up sartorially, the House is a
collection of baggy pants and overworked coats
and shapeless hats, though the Premier has some
nice London clothes draping his figure to com-
parative slenderness. A mild joke brightened the
all-night sitting. A member who is an adver-
tising tailor poured forth a long and windy speech,
and then J. Haynes arose and said it was a pity
that the previous speaker’s speeches weren’t as well
shrunken as his goods were advertised to be.
The wedding of Miss Groth, daughter of Mr.
H. H. Groth, of Sydney, was an event in Croydon
last week. The bridegroom is Mr. Montague
Robinson, a son of Peter Robinson the Great, of
Regent-street, London, who met his bride while
on a visit here. Her wedding-gown was an Edition
de luxe of the orthodox white satin and orange-
blossom, be-diamonded by the bridegroom. The
knot was tied in St. James’s Church, Croydon,
and attracted a large audience. A train of five
bridesmaids filed after the bride, and the groom
had a contingent of three friends to support him
through the ordeal. A large party was afterwards
given by Mr. and Mrs. Groth in honor of the
occasion.
The Amateur Orchestral Concert in the Town
Hall last Wednesday evening went with a loud
and tuneful bang from beginning to end. It was
a “special-request ” programme, and the audience
was so enraptured at its own choice that it
wanted it twice over. Several things were en-
cored, and, after one item, conductor Hazon
bowed and smiled as if he were going to repeat it,
then leant over and gave the orchestra the tip for
the next number with a grin. He “ had ” the
people this way several times, but they were all
very enthusiastic, and gave him a laurel wreath.
Rivers-Allpress played exquisitely and to great ap-
plause—though he is only a local, not an imported,
fiddler. The dressing in the hall was a weird en-
semble of street and evening garb. From the
gallery the hats below looked, like the marked-
down stock of an insolvent draper, and the dresses
were dowdy to match.
At the Town Hall, on Thursday evening,
Florence Schmidt warbled her last to a Sydney
audience, before her departure for ’Ome and more
study. She sang more charmingly than ever.
For so young a vocalist, the Bananaland songstress
has had a record career. This time last year she
was absolutely unknown to the public, and now
she has come with a rush into the front rank.
She intends to tour in the North early next year,
and also proposes to sing to a Melb. audience.
Miss Schmidt has an idea of her own in platform-
gowning, which she carried out on Thursday—in
pale blue brocade cut in a fashion that adds to her
height. Miss Ruby Reynolds, a pupil of Mr.
Steffani, sang her best, clad in simple white. An-
other draw was Lees at the piano, who
rattled over the most appalling difficulties like
five-finger exercises. Two men balanced the gifted
girlishness of the programme: M. Stael, on the
violin, and Mr. Gooud, who was encored for his
second song.
Carnations as small as daisies, a few wilted
sweet peas, and some nondescript yellow flowers
are all the floral glories this early summer has for
show. Flower-sellers in desperation are thinking
of giving up from failure of supplies. Out of un-
E remising materials, however, some very swagger
askets and posies were contrived, and handed in
farewell to Austral passengers on Monday last.
One particular tribute, bright with pinks and in-
frequent roses, was given to Miss Hilda Hoskings,
one of Sydney’s pretty girls who is departing for
London and a high-toned wedding, as she is to be
married on arrival to Mr. “Bert” Macarthur,
brother of Mr. W. Macarthur. On Friday last,
on board the Austral, Mrs. D. Anderson (Miss
Hoskings’ sister) gave an afternoon party at which
many friends were present to say good-bye to the
bride-elect, who shook hands attached to a huge
bunch of pink and mauve flowers, and wore a
white and frilly frock.
Poor little Sadie Macdonald, the fascinating
American soubrette who died a year ago last
Monday, had the art of making friends. Her
anniversary was remembered. Florists in town
were kept busy making up bunches of such rare
white blossoms as the drought and heat have
allowed to grow, and the lonely little grave near
the sea was heaped up with flowers. Then the
camera-man came along and photoed the decora-
tions, and a full description of each flower-trophy,
with name of donor, appeared next morning in
the papers, and the poetry and sentiment fled
from the incident, which thereby shrivelled into
the usual hideous self-advt.
The handbill in the penny-dreadful style put
forth by the Salvation Army to emphasise the be-
ginning of the Slum Scouring by Mrs. Booth and
sister-workers, gives Sydney a worse character
than Melbourne. “Iliad heard,” it remarks in
large capitals, “ that the shady side of Sydney
was darker still in some places than the darkest
part of the slums of Melbourne, and, alas, I can
but say it is only too true.” Mrs. B. and Mrs.
Major Wassberg set out to explore “ darkest
Sydney ” thoroughly, and including the beer, and
bad smells, and the opium-dens, and all the other
heavy shadows the picture is not more sensation-
ally lurid an exposure than ordinary police-court
cases show. There are some bright lights in it,
too. In the slumming was discovered one young
woman “on the downward track,” who has
worked hard to keep other women from following
in her own steps, and even paid the board of one
young girl for a long time to keep her out of the
streets. Also, a sensational episode of a betrayed
young woman with “ the loveliest baby,” slaving
alone honestly to support herself and child in one
small hired room, presents chiefly a shining ex-
ample of moral courage more precious than rubies
in this Grundy-ridden community, where the
average mother of an unwonted infant ties it up
neatly in brown paper and drops the parcel over
the nearest fence. The handbill ends in a to-be-
continued-in-our-next fashion, promising to give in
another issue the spicy life-storv of “Nellie the
Cockroach,” now doing time on’Cockatoo Island,
and tacks on an epigrammatic tag-moral, “ The
way of transgressors is hard indeed, especially
when it leads to oakum-picking.”
Nicholson and Co. send a bundle of eight draw-
ing-room ballads, three of which, at least, climb
considerably out of the ruck of the mediocrity
usual to this class of publication. “ Golden
Lilies,” by Franco Leoni, already very popular
here; “The 'ihree Guides” (Behrendj, wedded
to charming verse by L. A. Lefevre ; and a new
setting of Tom Hood’s “I Love Thee,” by E.
Beningfield, are all most fascinating ditties. An
inevitable Chaminade, “April,” is a rippling little
lay which would take a “ bit of doing,” as Chirg-
win would say, on the singer’s part, for the vocal
gymnastics it contains are considerable. For the
piano there are four dainty little compositions.
“Moderato in C,” by Walter Maofarren, and
“ Elgin King’s March,” by G. Leese, are carefully
fingered and quite within the scope of the fingers
of the early-morning practiser. “ Air de Ballet ”
(Bachman) and “ In the Meadow ” (Sherwin Mar-
shall) have more pretensions to musical show-off,
but are taking little pieces, bound to become well-
known.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“An unmistakeable aroma of deputy-vice-regal
distinction clings to Chief Justice Madden and hia
comely womankind, in the columns of the daily
press. An Argus paragraph states that * Lady
Madden and Miss Madden, who have been visit-
ing England in connection with the Jubilee cele-
brations, return to Melbourne by the ’ &c., &o.
They will be accompanied by Colonel Campbell,
aide-de-camp to Sir John Madden when he was
Acting-Governor of Victoria.’ The sweet in-
genuity of which par. suggests that this some-
times Excellency wrote it himself. Mrs. Madden
and the girls have certainly been visiting England
at Jubilee time, but their connection with that
brief madness was ‘all on their little own.’ And
considering that the expedition had no official
character, and was nothing to make a song about,
it really doesn’t seem absolutely necessary to brag
in the fact that Colonel Campdell acted as accom-
panist.
“ Busy little Mrs. Freeman Thomas has
appointed herself president of the ‘Nagel Con-
cert Committee,’ so one may take it for granted
that Regina N. will be fired off to Europe with a
great big bang (and a satisfactory cheque) before
the year runs out. The nervous damsel is gifted
with a phenomenal voice, as everybody knows
who heard her sing * Ben Bolt ’ when she was
fully wound up. If she discovers the force of
character necessary to carry her through a course
of training in Paris or London, the world at large
will hear from Regina Nagel presently. The
future of the voice depends solely upon the deter-
mination of the singer. Some people are apt to
shrug their shoulders and hope for the best in
Miss Nagel’s case, but, anyway, she is a fit and
proper subject for a grand farewell testimonial
concert. The event is fixed for Dec. 8, Town
Hall.
“The Metropolitan Liedertafel put all possible
pathos into its 187th programme. Maybe the rival
society’s recent capture of conductor Marshall-
Hall came as a poke in the eye to Ernest Wood’s
nightingales. At all events, most of the choruses
were doleful as funeral hymns, the sandwiched
serenades sounding jiggery in comparison.
“ Gov. and Lady Brassey arrived rather earlier
than usual, as per contract, the latter wearing her
feather-ruched cape. Aides Neville and Shaftes-
bury came along, too. The first-named, excellent
creature that he is, always looks as if he loved
doing his duty, unlike his comrade in calamity.
This wretched young man. on the strength of
being a sweet singer, must dree his weird (who-
ever else gets off scot-free) every time Govt. House
commits itself to a concert. Son-in-law'Freeman-
Thomas, though less gifted in the matter of voice,
is also a musical enthusiast. But on Liedertafel
night he was at the Neglected Children’s Meeting,
warbling of embraces, eyes, and suchlike—so
appropriate to Miss Sutherland’s platform, wasn’t
it '!
“ The just-mentioned philanthropic spinster, by
the way, has lots to tell of London life, from her
point of view, and rescues the perishing with re-
newed relish. Meanwhile, the Kirk-society, from
which she seceded to start business on non-denomi-
national lines, goes on its child-saving way in
peace and quietness. At the present moment its
prize brands snatched from the burning are a
grey-haired girl of 12, who owes her silver threads
to anxiety and hardship, and a seven-year-old
who is learning the rudiments of kissing along
with cleanliness and catechism. Some authorities
consider that the said branch of a waif’s education
might just as well go on being neglected. In sup-
port of this view they point a warning finger at
the over-huggishness of ‘ Dr. Barnardo’s boy,’
named as co-respondent in a recent quashed
divorce suit. Who knows? P raps, if the curly-
headed affable sprat in question had been given
scope for his young affections in early life, he
wouldn’t have developed them so acutely at sweet
seventeen.
“ To return to the Liedertafel : Of the perfor-
mers, Maggie Sterling, in white brocade and
breast-knot of red carnations, held more than her
share both in looks and tunefulness. Debutante
Mabel Martin, in a jerk-tailed white costume,
took her first professional plunge with an air of
stern resolution, proving herself the lucky possessor
of a round, fresh, untrammelled young voice, with
room and to spare for vocal - polisher Armes
Beaumont to go on working his intelligent will
without danger of developing sharp edges. Then
there was tenor Walter Kirby, always more
effective in a smallish room, where you are near
enough to admire the color-blend of his brown
eyes and auburn hair instead of brooding over
those old defects of knee-and-toe deportment. A
girl in the audience was heard accusing Mr. Kirby
of a ‘ milk-oh voice,” but girls were critical that
evening. You see, there were such mobs of them.
Unbroken rows stretched right across the Town
Hall from wall to wall. An extra lucky line had
a male creature at each end. One of these was
frightfully old—somewhere near the ‘seventh-age,’
I guess ; the other a fresh young thing in the very
prime of his teens.
“In the stalls at ‘The Gay Parisienne,’ the
other night, sufferers girded at the wearer of a
fine specimen of the ‘ we-are-seven hat ’ —five
white plumes and two black ones.
“ At a public entertainment the other evening
much notice was lavished on an old lady with
phenomenally thin arms in scant black sleeves,
and curls a fa Christian Adventiste— i.e. , five
smooth oily ringlets meekly parted and snooded
with black velvet. So much for Joan ! Darby, a
well-set-up patriarch, was palpably proud as Punch
of his partner. Hard-by, a nice, comfortable old
thing, plump as a partridge, with a baldish patch
on top and no cap, received far less attention from
‘John Anderson, Aer Jo.’ These studies in human
nature destroyed my childlike faith in a recent
Bulletin paragraph, which quoted somebody or
other to the effect that ‘ no man ever unreservedly
loved a woman with thin arms.’
“ A blind Vic. country girl, at present staying
in Melbourne, goes everywhere, theatre, cricket-
matches, Block, &c., with as much pleasure, appar-
ently, as if she could see. On the Block, perhaps,
she doesn’t miss much by being blind, and pro-
bably at the theatre there has never yet been a big
hat in front of her.
“ One of the Women’s Hospital Committee
(Carlton, Vic.) objected to a candidate for cap and
pinny because she wore spectacles. ‘ They mig t
drop off at a critical moment,’ quoth the wise
woman. Have none of the ladies ever noticed
that Dr. Dunbar Hooper, one of their honorary
medicos, wears a pince-nez? Yet he and his eye-
glass were thought safe enough to attend Lady
Hopetoun on a certain interesting occasion. On
a par with this was the decree which compelled
the wearing of print gowns all the year through
by the last resident woman-doctor, while the men,
resident and honorary alike, wore serge or broad-
cloth at their own sweet will. A coat and trousers
could not possibly convey infection. Oh no!
“ Art is the correct cult of the moment among
the ‘smart set.’ Soulful maidens and youthful
matrons in pairs or trios set up studios, dabble
among oils, perpetrate highly-colored caricatures
of friends good-natured enough to sit to them, ask
all their acquaintances to come and see them and
enjoy themselves immensely on their ‘ at home ’
days, when the clatter of china and tongues and
laughter resounds through the building. Some
girl-artists have work-shop studios and really mean
business. Clever Miss Chapman is making way
as a portrait-pain ter, and has now tenor New-
bury’s counterfeit presentment smiling from the
canvas in a nearly-finished stage. On her walls
she has some well-treated seascapes, but finds
portraits better commission work.
“ Melb. sassiety is smiling on baritone Peachey,
and he has many cards for Naice tea-parties, etc.
Actors covet social notice for biz. reasons, as ‘the
Finn ’ recognise the value of the advt. if the query
about an imported artist ‘Do you meet him out?’
is answered in the aftiruiati ve.
“A male addition to a certain family in am
Australian city was recently the cause of much,
rejoicing, for the two previous children had beern
girls. The boy came a few days before the family
were to shift to another house, and on the last
morning under the old roof pa and ma went down,
to breakfast leaving him snugly asleep in the
nuptial couch. They returned in due course,
and on entering the room—! 1 !—the bed
had completely disappeared, and there wasn’t
a sign of the son-and-heirlet. Then a*
pale, wild-eyed, terror-stricken couple rushed!
frantically through the house, and finally
ran against two men who had been clearing
out some of the rooms, according to removal con-
tract, during the early morn. When father and
mother had gasped out their calamity, the two
men explained that, seeing the room empty, they
had supposed it to be ready for clearance, and had
begun by rolling the bedding, tying it up, and
depositing it in the van outside ! It didn't take
many minutes to recover and unroll that bedding,
and it was accomplished just in time. Then there
was again great rejoicing in that household, even
as at the birth of male twins.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
The Suffield Case.

Thanks for vour article “ Su(field and Justice.” How
the N.S.VV. “democratic” M>P. (who hold, if they only
knew it, the strings of the public purse) allowed the esti-
mates for the department of justice to pass without forc-
ing an enquiry is beyond me. The S.M. Herald of to-day
(25th Nov.) can devote a leaderette to the woes of the
unhappy Dreyfus, of France ; but closes its columns to the
case of Suffleid.

The Bulletin’s Xmas Number (ready
December 9) will be as good as any previous
number, and better if possible. All the old favorite
Bulletin writers are represented by picked verse
and stories ; and some new ones this year come
to the front with a bang. Illustrations adorn:'
every page ; and from cover to cover the issue will!
be as original and characteristic and Australian as
it is possible to make it. The price will be six-
pence, as usual; post-free from Bulletin office,
7d. elsewhere than to Queensland, and B|d. to
Queensland. As the supply of past Xmas num-
bers has almost invariably run short, agents who
have not yet sent in their orders are desired to
apply at once in order to avoid disappointment.
The Bulletin purposes printing shortly
the opinions it has received from medical men and
others in regard to the notorious Suffield case.
So far, the essence of these opinions is an exclama-
tion at the astounding quality of the evidence
which in Botany Bay can earn a man ten years’
penal servitude. Meantime, Suffield spends a
merry Xinas behind his bars because—though
offered mercy—he will have justice.
Queensland Government has dropped the
Federal Enabling Bill once more. When Nelson
was last in Sydney he stated that for the purpose
of electing delegates to the next Convention,
Queensland would be divided into three consti-
tuencies. He introduced the Bill with Queensland
as one constituency, which meant, of course, that
the South would nominate all ten delegates, or
thereabouts. The Northern and Central members
demanded the three-electorate system, and Nel-
son, instead of adhering to his pledge, said they
might amend the Bill if they could, but he
wouldn’t support the amendment anyhow. Then
the northern and central crowd, reckoning it)
better to postpone Federation than to have their
share of the Constitution-making delegated
entirely to the Brisbane gang, joined forces with
the anti-Federationists, and the bill was thrown
out by 21 votes against 19. This makes the third
rejection, and the treachery of the Nelson Minis-
try was the cause each time.

With the exception of G. R. Dibbs, no
ex-Premier of N.S. Wales is now living.

■way from their wives. ’ —Quixote to Sancho.
Mr. Justice A. H. Simpson has not yet
taken his seat on N.S.W. Equity Bench. He
always stands up to it.
The Bulletin hears on undoubted autho-
rity that Mr. J. T. Toohey, of Sydney, was offered a
knighthood in England, and not a mere C.M.G.-
ship.
AND SO HE OUGHT TO BE.
FRIEND (new arrival from ’Ome, to a recent lessee of the
Halick ): “ Who’s that you've just raised your hat
to, Mercutio ? Musician, 1 suppose ? ”
MR. M'Brown (curtly) : “Bland ’Olt.”
FRIEND (gazing after the retreating -figurej: “Hum! Ive
heard of him in the old country. So he s Bland, eh?
MR. M‘B. : “ Well, why the devil shouldn’t he he—to the
public, anyhow. They’ve treated him a lot
better than they ever treated me. Let’s have a drink.
There’s a good deal of the un-heredity of
genius about the fact that grand old Walter
Savage was the grandfather of the notoriety-hunt-
ing “ Johnny ” who has been getting himself
gratuitously mangled in Thibet. To judge from
both the young gentleman’s-likeness (as drawn by
himself) and his letters, it’s not so much dare-
devil courage that’s the matter with him as the
simple want of perception which made him during
his visit to Australia a favorite butt of that
irreverent old man, Parkes.
Printed as “a rumour” that “Curly”
Jones, member for Petersham (N.S.W.), who has
just been entertained by his constituents on his
return from London, is to receive a knighthood,
“as the result of his recent visit to England, and
in recognition of his services in the legal, muni-
cipal, and political life of New South Wales.
The Bulletin hopes this is true. Curly Jones
deserves knighthood. Also, the institution of
knighthood deserves Curly Jones.
In the face of the details so circum-
stantially set forth of the career of the celebrated
Margaret Catch pole (Mrs. Reibey) it is curious to
find her grandson asserting that, as she was
13 at the time of the horse-“ borrowing ” incident,
she was never dealt with by law at all, and that
instead of coming to Botany Bay as a convict she
was sent out by her relatives under care of a
clergyman. But this, be it remembered, was her
own version of the circumstances.
Suffield is still in his living grave, and the
N.S.W. Justice Department is jumping on him
with all its feet to make him fit that grave.
Suffield is a victim not only of Windeyerism, but
of Government by Contradiction. Both N.S.W.
political gangs, the ins and the outs, are interested
m justifying the actions of their respective Minis-
ters of Justice. A pamphlet fully dealing with
this monstrous wrong has just been published.

Ed. Bulletin, —Let me, as a Westralian,
protest against the term “groper” as applied in
your paper to the principals of the recent (Glen
Dhu) flogging-case. The two person? named were
imported a few years ago from Victoria, and so
are not Westralians. The W. A’s. are bad enough,
but please do not say that because a man kills a
couple of niggers in this district he must be a
groper. As you say, if the cliaroe is proved, the
accused ought to hang, but let them please hang
as Victorians and not as gropers.— Leg Iron.
Brisbane (Q.) Worker gives publicity to a
number of rumors that have long been bandied
about in whispers all over Queensland, in an article
headed —“ Is Drury dead ? ” The Bulletin here-
with gives an authentic anecdote, that has not
yet found its way into print :—The Brisbane
corpse-planter who buried Drury, being chaffed
by a friend on this ever-living scandal, said—
“ Why, I put him in his coffin myself. D’you
think I wouldn't know my own banker, sir ? Yes,
sir; Drury screwed a lot of people up, and I
screwed him down!"
From a hint dropped by Chief Justice
Darley one day last week, a resignation from the
N.S.W. Bench or an extended leave of absence
may be looked for after the long vacation.
Dr. Cockburn, if the present S.A. Govt, is
in office when the vacancy occurs, will probably
succeed Playford as Agent-General. Holder has
a big family and is poor, or else he would get the
post.
The dust of G. Dunmore Lang (a son of
John Dunmore Lang) was removed the other day
from Gulgong (N.S.W.) cemetery, where it was
buried in 1873, and interred in the family vault at
Sydney.
Apparently Adelaide Hospi-
tal doctors Napier and Smith have
no power of appeal against the
action of the British Medical As-
sociation in striking them off the
roll of membership. Some mem-
bers of the Adelaide branch of
the 8.M.A., by the way, recently
started a similar movement against
the Adelaide doctors who are on
the Hospital honorary staff, but
they were unsuccessful.
When rumors first got out
about the silver-finds at Broken
Hill, a well-known Western squat-
ter, who thought of investing,
happened to mention the matter to
a Yankee stranger whom he was
entertaining for the night, where-
upon the other, announcing that
lih was a “silver-expert,” advised
him instead to pitch his sovereigns
into the adjoining lake. “Then
you’ll know where they are, at all
events, and perhaps even get some
of them back —which is more than
will happen if you put them in
Broken Hill ! ” And the squatter
allowed himself to be thus choked-
off becoming one of the original
shareholders in the Proprietary
mine at <£l6o a share. One of
these original shares fell to the lot
of a young Englishman who had
become engaged to a girl with
.£lO,OOO, and had come out to
Australia to try to make an
equivalent amount before fulfilling
the engagement. After trying all
sorts of things, he took to book-
making, and, when on his way to
Silverton races, met a man who
wanted to sell the share in ques-
tion. The Englishman proposed
to decide by a game of cards
whether he should give £l6O for
the share or £l2O. He won, and
afterwards sold the share for
£60,000 to a person who is now a
millionaire.
Another bogus lord down
South run-in for allegedly “ obtain-
ing.” We begin to read the
maxim differently in Australia: “He who
lendeth to the lord giveth to the poor.”
The recent marriage of a grandson of the
late Chief-Justice Alfred Stephen—-N.S.W.’s noto-
rious hanging judge—was performed by (of all
men) Bishop Stretch !
“ Johnny ” Sandes, of the Arous “ Oriel ”
trio, was married last week in Melbourne to Miss
Clare Berry, the handsome third daughter of
Victoria’s ex Speaker. The bridegroom is the
“My friend, Mr. Sandes,” who collaborated with
Dr. “PJevna” Ryan in bringing out the recent
bright narrative of the Turco-Russian war of 20
years back, entitled “Under the Red Crescent.”
Recent mention of Dr. Spiridion Can-
diottis —“ Candiottis the Greek ” —recalls a Rock-
hampton incident of 30 years ago. A symposium
of the “card-push” at Johnny Ward’s “Criterion”
ended in a free fight, in the course of which
“ Candy,” having floored his particular
antagonist with a stick, put the bottom
rung of a chair across the man’s neck
and sat on the chair—lCst. of him
till the poor devil was apparently
choked to death. They had hard
work to bring him round, and
when the doctor was afterwards
fined <£■) over the affair he said :
“ When a man has to fork out
a fiver for defending his life,
it’s time he cleared out of
Rockhampton ! ” And he
cleared accordingly.
Saul Samuel, when he
first became a N.S.W.
Minister of the Crown,
rehearsed an important
speech with great care,
and under the criticism
of a gentleman who
whispered the fact abroad.
Samuel, it appeared, in
order to perfect his pos-
tures and gestures, spoke
his speech in front of a
large cheval glass. When
he came to deliver the
oration, he got on very
well for a time ; then he
halted and blundered.
“Bring in the looking-
glass ! ” snuffled Jack Robertson, “ the honor-
able member wants to brush up his memory.” The
jibe, instead of baulking Samuel, pulled him
together, and he went on to the end without
further pause or confusion.
Dear Bulletin, —That yarn furnished you
re Geoff. Eagar and Jock Robertson really relates
to Hon. Bowie. Here’s the real Eagar incident:
Hon. Geoff having said in the House that, at
school, J. R. had been known as Jack Brag,
Robertson retorted that, “ at school, we used to
call the hon. member ‘ Betsy,’ and used to refrain
from laying hands on her, on account of her sex ! ”
—A.L.
The latest name submitted for the N.S.W.
Speakership is that of W. P. Crick—than whom,
in point of readiness and constitutional-legal
knowledge, there is, admittedly, no one so compe-
tent. In point of dignity— well, in the words of
old Jack Robertson—“ Damn dignity ! ”
John Williamson, Superintendent of the
province of Auckland in 1859, had a weakness for
good liquor, and once at a dinner-party at Govern-
ment House—in Gov. Gore Browne’s time —when
the ladies arose to leave the gentlemen to their
wine, Mrs. Williamson kept her seat till she had
to be reminded that Mrs. Browne had retired.
“Aweel!” she said, “may be sae. Her man
diesna need her. But ma Jock diesna sit here
wi’oot me tae keep tally o’ his stoups. Hoot! he
wad be that fou in twa minutes, he wadna be able
tae tell the Governor frae the Superintendent—
and that’s himsel’. Gang awa’, ladies. I’ll joost
keep ma een on Wulliamson.” And she did.
When the benevolent Capt-. Machonochie
ruled at Norfolk Island, the convicts took ad-
vantage of his leniency, and, among other things,
they stole his choicest ducks, which were under
the care of a half-witted fellow known as “ Stut-
tering Billy.” Every other day or so, Billy came
back with a diminished charge, till the captain at
last got “ mad,” and gave Billy half-a-dozen, and
Billy asserted that they “ floo-o-o-ed away.” He
was tied up again, but still the ducks went till
none remained. “The blanky d-u-cks, sir,” re-
ported Billy, “fell in-in-ter th’ cr cr-eek, and wa-s
dr-dr tnvnd-ed.” At which the captain was so
tickled that he let Billy off his usual allowance.
Billy lived to be “ respectable ” in Hobart, and to
be known as “ the duck drowner.”
Capt. Beckham, police magistrate at Auck-
land (M.L.), before the last war, had his court at
the upper end of Queen-street, and, to get there,
had to pass the shop of a butcher, whose taste
for dog-fights and cock-fights had frequently
brought him before the P.M., with unpleasant
results. The butcher cast about for revenge
until he hit upon the idea of calling a bull-
pup “ Beckham,” and trained it to go to the
other side of the road and sit there, so that,
when Beckham came along, the butcher would
open out: “ Beckham ! Oh, you son of a beast !
There you are, loafin’ around as usual. Come
here, you ugly, stoopid, hignorant himposter ! ”
And, when the P.M. had passed along, boiling
over, the butcher would whistle up his pup and
shout half-a-pound of steak for him. But, the
next time the butcher was run-in, he got six
months ; and when he came out, he found that his
wife had run away with a smallgoods-man, and
the shop was shut up. He enlisted, and was shot
at Waikau. A novel in a nutshell.
The recent death of Dr. Newfield Lucas in
Adelaide revives the old tragedy of the St. Kilda
Road Barracks (Melb.) of 1857. The 40th regt.
was stationed there at the time, and among the
young officers were Lucas, then a lieutenant, Sur-
geon Macauley, Ensign Veith and another ensign
—a wild Irishman named Pennyfather. Penny-
father had boasted of his immunity from certain
trouble that most young men fall into, so, when
he himself did join the great majority, he was
subjected to much chaff. One afternoon, the re-
marks of his fellow officers turned him into a
raging lunatic, and, drawing a revolver, he shot
Macauley dead, sent a bullet through Veith’s
cheeks, lodged a third in Lucas’s jaw and a fourth
in his own brain. At the inquest a verdict of
suicide whilst of unsound mind was returned, and
both murdered and murderer were buried in the
present Melb. cemetery, where a publicly-sub-
scribed monument stands over them. Veith
returned to England, and, after years, Lucas
recovered (the bullet still remained somewhere
beneath his tongue) and joined the military forces
in Adelaide. Some years ago, the bullet came
out of his jaw, but a cancer formed and killed him
—4O years after the injury was inflicted.

Bishop Green, of Armidale, whose diocesan
monetary troubles are sufficiently exasperating,
lias had his first important nomination—that of
Canon Sowter to the vacancy left by the late Arch-
deacon King—set aside by a church council.
Said that when a very exalted potentate
was told that he might be included in a con-
spiracy -to - defraud charge, he blasphemed—
“ Charge me with blanky blank conspiracy ?
Prosecute me for blankety fraud ? Go and dig up
that blankety blank coffin; that old blankety
blank blank ain’t there ! ”
The squatter king, M'Caughey, holds
3,000,000 acres. One trifle of 45,000 acres in
Riverina he calls a stud-farm. He has a million
acres near Hughenden, Q., and two huge stations on
the Darling, Tooralie and Dunlop. During last
drought he is said to have lost 1-00,000 sheep and
lambs. Shears a million sheep, the world’s re-
cord. Truly a mammoth among mutton-raisers.
A most important event is when M‘Caughey “gets
his wool off.”
Melb. : “ Says Soft goods Beath to Soft-
goods Sargood about half a year ago : ‘ I hope you
won’t be away enjoying yourself « hen your fire
comes off.’ The Sargood business was founded
by the military and millinery Sargood’s father,
but the Sargood of to-day wrought it up,
while the title was Sargood and Son. It was
the first Melbourne house in any line to go
for Dunedin (M.L.) in a big way. Sargood
capers about in such an absurd fashion as a
military General Bombastes, and is such a
thoroughly commonplace politician, that his
genuine ability is overlooked though, indeed,
there is no occasion why such an eminent business
man and money-maker should care to be recog-
nised.”
T.D. : “7fe the contention that Supreme
Court Judges are badly paid in comparison with
other successful barristers. At the very most only
three Sydney barristers would top Chief Justice
Darley’s screw (.£350 ) —and Salomons, who pro-
bably leads the lot, was ready enough to take the
Chief - Justiceship when chance offered. The
ordinary Judge sits (say) six hours a day, and has
pretty well done with it; the busy Q.C. plods
and bustles double those hours, and to keep it up
must take his annua jaunt to Eurojie—or Japan.
When a Judge retires, he has a thumping pension
at hand, but fees cease when a barrister throws
up the sponge. The Judge pays no office rent,
keeps no clerks—has every cent, for his own
pocket.”
Tennyson Sini'li—here Australia smiles—
is converting the English provinces—and making
some casual observations re Tennyson Smith,
thus (from a provincial paper):—
Once there was a young man (in Australia, of,course)
who was exceedingly and excessively of the.nil admircri
stamp, and who would not go to be converted until his
despairing persuader promised to refund the money paid
for the ticket if he did not laugh or cry during the lec-
ture. On the platiorm the lecturer came, pale but deter-
mined. There the young man sat, cold as a frog, close as
an oyster. The lecturer began, proceeded, told one of his
best stories. No sign. Told a better story. The corners
of the young man’s mouth twitched. Then he (Smith)
said, “ Up Guards and at them,” and gave his most
humorous sketch. The enemy wavered, broke, fled, and
Waterloo was won. Then he grew pathetic, tender.
Hist! What was that? Plash, plash! tinkle, tinkle!
Tub tub—tu-hoo -boo—boo ; that callous, cold-hearted
young man wept. Wept ? And it sounded like “ Plash,
plash ! tinkle, tinkle ! tub, tub, tub ; hoo boo hoo.”
Heavens—what an ear Smith must have.' Ar.d
what a ghastly old chestnut !
The recent Wentworth versus Single, Emu
Plains land case, tried before N.S.W. Chief Jus-
tice Darley, sent the jury back to 1838. Deeds of
land were then favorite gifts of those in power.
But Wentworth met one Governor—Gipps—who
inflicted a knock-out on his land-acquisition
ambition, or “ the great Tory,” as Parkes used to
call him, would have died proprietor of most of
Australia. Wentworth negotiated with the Maori
chiefs of his day for the whole Middle Island and
a great slice of the North Island, and succeeded in
having the properties conveyed to himself and his
associates in due legal form. But Gipps declared
the transaction void, on the ground that the
Caucasian had simply wheedled the brown man.
Wentworth, who was a fighter and had duly-exe-
cuted deeds at his back, was eventually beaten by
the sheer exercise of authority on the part of
Gipps—one illustration of the occasional useful-
ness of a benevolent despot.

Re the great Melbourne Flinders-lane fire,
where £1,000,000 worth of property went off with a pop
and a “whoosh,” a local official of the North British
and Mercantile remarks loftily that he “hopes it will put
an end to all talk about State or municipal fire insurance.”
Then he says: “Suppose a municipal insurance office
were in existence in Melbourne, with a monopoly of busi-
ness, how could it meet claims amounting to over half-a-
million sterling ? Even if business was done by the State,
the losses could only be met by means of a fresh loan."
By way of a wildly original observation, this paper sug-
gests that probably the State Fire Insurance Department
would meet its losses out of premiums just as the North
British and Mercantile does. At least, the M.L. State Life
Department does that—just the way the N.B. and M.
Life Department does.

Two competing Brunswick (Vic.) grocers started
cutting rates on potatoes recently, and the prices soon
came down almost to zero. Still the fighters kept at it,
chuckling to themselves that the other man couldn’t hold
out much longer—until they both found that every other
grocer in the district was buying his tubers anonymously
from one or other of the contestants. Which recalls how
Jay Gould beat the opposition railroad line that tried to
knock him out by offering to carry cattle 300 miles at 3d.
a head. Jay didn’t trouble about railroad business after
that offer. He went in for cattle-dealing, and ran several
hundred thousand beasts over the other line before its
bosses “tumbled.”

An awful slump has fallen on most of the Maori-
land mines passed on to Bull and co. during the last two
years. Already several sales per sheriff have occurred.
Representatives from London have arrived and were so
appalled at the prospect that immediate orders to shut
down were given. The salter and lying expert put in
some good work ; and, amid the number of shows floated
and for which ample working capital was furnished, it is
declared that there are only two or three displaying any
prospect of returning the money spent on them.
The gentlemen recently mulct in damages
for improperly investing the funds in the estate
for which they were trustees, lost no time in tak-
ing it out (with a vengeance) of the attorney who
engineered the action against them. _ By the way,
few gents one down south are sufficiently solvent
to dare risk the result to themselves of a success-
ful action of this nature.

Hess, in the South African Critic, on
Labouchere : “ I have branded and now again brand
Mr. Labouchere, M.P., as a heartless contemptible
scoundrel, who, for his own personal pecuniary
gain, was, during the years 1874-6-0, engaged (1)
in a deliberate fraud on the pockets of the public ;
(2) in a systematic attempt to plunder the in-
vestor and shareholder; (3) in a fraudulent con-
spiracy to swindle them; and (4) in persistent
attacks which resulted in their ruin upon four men—
now deceased —each of whom was, compared to
him, the very soul of honor and integrity.” And
now it is cabled that Labouchere has injuncted Hess
from publishing certain letters written by him (L.)
to the late George Augustus Sala.

Re Lucknow strike. There is no doubt
that gold-stealing on a large scale has gone on in
the Luoknow mines for many years (writes a Bul-
lktin correspondent). Twenty or thirty years ago
the miners used to invent all sorts of methods for
concealing the gold, so that they could get out of
the mine without being caught. One long-suc-
cessful dodge was to bore an auger-hole 3 or 4in.
deep in the end of a pick-handle and fill it up with
mud. Then, in the mine, when the miner had got
what gold he could “shake,” he had only to knock
out the mud, shove the gold in, and fill it up with
mud again. The thieves used to have trouble in
getting rid of the gold, the only buyers being a
few little local storekeepers, who, knowing that it
was stolen, would only give ridiculously small
prices—often as low as 6s. an oz. —for the purest
gold in Australia. The buyers abovementioned,
when sending the stolen gold away for sale else-
where, used to conceal it in different ways. One was
by putting a good-sized package of it in a barrel of
tallow.

THE IMPOSSIBLE .
COMPASSIONATE STEWARD: “ Can I bring anything np for you, sir?"
PASSENGER (faintly)'. “ No, thanks. I'm afraid I’ll have to do it all myself /”
Hermann Aron, German Imperial Council-
lor of State, who describes himself as probably the
largest individual holder of Westralian mining stocks,
writing to Modest Maryanski, saying that all German
investors have to thank M. M. for arresting the panio
that had set in by giving them a true conception of the
future of Kalgoorlie :—“We Germans know well the true
state of affairs. We remember only too well the lying
prospectuses issued by dishonest boomsters, filled with
glowing reports from so-called mining engineers. Nothing
can prevent these men, who are well-known, from being
roasted in the fire of hell—of this world’s contempt.
The non-discerning publio steams these in one compre-
hensive kettle, but the few of us who have better oppor-
tunities of judging know that there are still a few
mining engineers capable and honest. The time of lies
and deception is past. We now go carefully through
ever}' prospectus, report, &o. If such names as yours
and others like yours are appended the shares will be
subscribed, but otherwise German investors will pitoh
each prospectus into the waste-paper basket.”

“ The only way to rely on making good miners,
and therefore safe miners, is to catch them young, and
train them.” Late statistics from the United States sup-
port this view. Colorado figures for ’96 show 6'96 fatal
accidents per 1000 men employed underground ; for the
same year, the United Kingdom figures showed 171 per
thousand. In the States, as in Australia, a pretty large
percentage of miners, especially in the metal-mines, are
comparative new-chums at the game ; while in the U.K.
the son is a miner because the father was. Still, the
average N.S.W. rate is under 3 per 1000.

treatment. Furthermore, they had transformed the
tunnel into a sort of quarry by the reckless use of dyna-
mite.

“ Mt. Lyell co. spent £700,000 in buildings,
machinery, and railway to develop the property. North
Mt. Lyell and other specs, expect to get to work on the
ore with incomparably less amounts. What chance have
they ?” Much otherwise depends—higher-grade ore, for
instance, will stand heavier working cost, and no mine
can spend such an enormous amount of money without,
in more ways than one, lightening the burden of (Lhers in
the vicinity. Mt. Lyell had to build its own line. Now
speculators are fighting to build railways to the others.

gineer’s ability.

The Vic. Mines Amendment Act is in opera-
tion, and Bendigo is feeling it pinch, as companies all
round are refusing to let tributes under it. The co.’3
bugbear is the sustenance or, as it is locally called, the
half-wages clause, while there is some grumbling on both
sides because each crushing is to stand on its own bottom.
It is not the little mines only that have placed much reli-
ance on tributors ; the New Chum Consol, Specimen Hill,
and Hustler’s Reef, for instance, have been largely sup-
ported hitherto by them. And on the whole the tributors
have been the most experienced workmen, too. How-
ever, local opinion seems to be that when the conditions
are better understood things will go on much as usual.

_ Stead, in his Klondyke article, and others, men-
tion that the Alaskan gold discoveries aren’t unexpected,
seeing that the Russian Govt, has long successfully worked
gold-mines in Siberia. Worked them? Rather. Cut, as
the writers say, they don’t boom them. Russia gets out
something like five millions sterling of gold annually, of
which three and a-half millions are got from Siberian and
other Asiatic territory. The increase in this production,
and the apparent certainty of continuing it, as a result of
the Trans-Siberian railway and otherwise, had a great deal
to do in leading Russia to lately throw over silver in favor
of a gold currency. French scientific papers have a good
deal to say about Russian gold-mines; English papers,
practically nothing.

“ There is no part of Australia where I would
sooner go to look for ‘a turn-up’ than the M‘Donnell
Ranges,” writes a Bullktin correspondent. “There I
saw some beautiful slate country (albeit somewhat dis-
turbed, but then, the richest pockets of many minerals
occur in ‘ disturbed ’ country), and there are innumerable
quartz and ironstone outcrops that have never been
tapped. The want of water, as usual, would be a draw-
back, but it could be overcome by making huge dams.
And thatcountry, unlike W .A.,would hold water. What is
chiefly prospected for there is mica, which occurs in an
outcrop of white rock, ‘blown out’ of ordinary granite ;
best claims found outcropping in garnetiferous granite.
The mica formation is, no doubt, merely an abnormal
granite (mica, felspar, and quartz in small particles, being
granite’s component parts). It is unsatisfactory stuff to
work. You’ve just to mine away everything ; and, after
quarrying out hundreds of tons of rock, very often dis-
cover no mica. There are no known indications by which
you can judge the likely or any quantity an outcrop holds.
The slabs of mica that go to make a solid block cross and
run into one another, and, as it is necessary to
out the marketable sheets without a flaw, the loss
is about 90 per cent. Clear and spotted mica of
three colours (preen, brown, and white) is found. It
is split to the thickness of Jin. and cut square. The
size varies from 3*3 inches to 20x20, and mica is worth
from 2s. to 265. per lb. A couple of years ago the world’s
output was less than 50 tons. It is a non-conductor of
heat and electricity. The M'Donnell Ranges have never
been prospected to any extent. A few dippers amonp
them raise a couple of hundred ounces cold every year.
They live from hand-to-mouth, and are a tough lot of
pioneers. It is hard country to travel about in. There is
known to be gold, galena, stream tin, mica, cinnabar, and
tons of garnets there. It was thought the garnets were
rubies till an opinion from Streeter, the London expert,
squashed that idea. Some of the garnets cut into pretty
gems. You can see any amount in the windows of Svd -
ney jewellers, generally set with Queensland opals, the
Burmese ruby is a bright scarlet color, those found in
“ The Territory ” are claret-colored. They withstand any
test for hardness, but being " off color ” damns them.

Mr. Rickard, the State Geologist of Colo-
rado, does not agree with Maryanski in compar-
ing Kalgoorlie with Cripple Creek. He says no two
regions could be more dissimilar in their geological
structure. Kalgoorlie reminded him more of certain parts
of N. Carolina and W. Ontario. The ore of the deeper
levels of the Kalgoorlie mines would probably he more
bunchy in character, the gold occurrence more sporadic,
making in short shoots and pockets of very rich ore
rather than evenly distributed along the strike of the
lode. The cost of exploration will he much greater in the
hard rock which lies below the zone of oxidation.
Colorado is the only part of the world where telluride ores
have been handled in a large way, and there they have
been usually accepted as ari incidental portion of smelter-
treatment — i.e., they have been absorbed by the smelters
of Denver, Pueblo, and Leadville as part of a large lead
and copper-smelting industry. The Cripple Creek mills
use both oyanidation and chlorination. Owing to the
presence of a high percentage of carbonate of iime and
magnesia in Kalgoorlie pres, chlorination was impractic-
able. Tests at Denver with ore from the Boulder Main
reef demonstrated the entire success of cyanidation after
the ore had been roasted. Dry-crushing had been found
to deliver the ore in a condition better suited for leaching
than wet-pulverisation. There, where the water difficulty
threatens to become aggravated, there should be no hesi-
tation in crushing the ores dry.

Kalgoorlie and Boulder City are perpetually em-
broiled. The latter—the younger'rival hasn’t up to date
got the ear of the Govt., and has practically no public
conveniences beyond post and telegraph offices has not,
even a savings-bank or M.0.0.-office. Moreover, the
banks are afraid to move, for fear of offending Kalgoorlie
customers, and so, for their own protection, have agreed
not to open at the Boulder. Wherefore the Boulder man
spends much of his time cursing everybody but himself;
and “ Smiler ” Hales daily screeches against Creation and
John Forrest.

The chief business of every syndicate or co.
working a copper-show in N.S.W. seems to consist of
shrieking for a water-jacket. “If we only had a water-
jacket!” A start was made with a little one recently.
When in full blast the furnace was tapped, and men stood
around with balls of clay. The moment the slag-pot was
full these were thrown at the tap-hole. Too often they
were fired wide, and slag and matter escaped. At last a
man who had seen a blast furnace turned up, and sug-
gested that if these clay balls were placed at the end of
an iron bar, the holes could be stopped without trouble.
Thus, in that small way, he has made a reputation which
in that district, time will not efface.
MY LADY NICOTINE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
she was born (so runs the rumour)
In the dusky isles of balm,
In the Southland she was cradled,
And she grew beside the palm ;
She’s enwrapt in soft aromas,
And a pair of blackest een
Dance beneath her curls of ebon—
Dainty Lady Nicotine!
She’s the dearest, deft beguiler
(Though her voice is wondrous low),
And for him who woos her duly
She can softly blush and glow ;
And her breath hath workings potent ;
For a wily witch (I ween )
Lurks within the sable vesture
Of My Lady Nicotine.
And for him who seeks a goddess
She hath altar—she hath shrine
Where her vot’ries ever tend her
With the sacred fire divine;
And for him who seeks a mistress
She's a kindly lissome Queen
For she loves the lips full-hewrded,
Does My Lady Nicotine.
And for him who seeketh Wisdom
She hath many a musing sage,
And a crown of calm that passeth
All the peace of wrinkled Age;
And for him who lives a-drearning
She hath many a Deep serene—
Many a Deep o’ Visions teeming
Hath My Lady Nicotine.
And when Lights o’ Love have left us,
When their siren song is sung,
Still she lingers softly near us
Though the knell of Youth is rung;
Still her charms have power to please us
Though our eyes have lost their sheen,
And her kindly kisses soothe us—
Gentle Lady Nicotine!

a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a

W. J. G. ELLIOTT, a veteran Australian cyclist.
Photo., Newman.
The Bulletin this week prints a portrait of
W. J. O. Elliott, a unique figure in Australasian—if not in
the world’s—cycling. As co-manager in the largest of
Australasian cycling firms, he works very often from 8
a.m. until II p.m.; yet, as a professional cyclist upon the
track, he is one of the most prominent racing men of the
day. Though he has been training for 20 years, and is
now married and labors under the handicap of a big
salary, he seems to suffer from a chronic ebullition of
energy. He is never content unless working in his office
with his coat off, or whizsing round the track at a 1.50
gait, or dancing at Govt. House, or pushing a fat
woman and her wheel up-hill (and likewise assist-
ing the daughter), or doing some such- thing calcu-
lated to break a man hopelessly down. His elder
brother did, in fact, kill himself by over-exertion
on the track, and W. J. 0. Elliott himself was warned, by
a Melb. doctor, years ago, to quit the excessive strain of
athletics. But Elliott has this rare gift which keeps him
together-he can lie down at any minute of the day or
night, on bed or board or solid stone, and instantly fall
asleep. On the day he won the last Sydney Wheel Race,
with its prize of £2OO-the largest ever yet won by a
cyclist in Sydney—he slept for two hours just prior to the
race. Though the athlete is in his blood, bones and brain,
he has none of the fads and foibles so popular with
athletes. He isn’t afraid of catching 1 cold, he eat* and
drinks what he likes, but he won’t touch alcohol or
tobacco. It is remarkable that this iron-nerved man
can be made absolutely groggy with two or three
whiffs of a cigar. Elliott is not a big man nor
an over-muscular one ; he succeeds in business and on the
'track by his cool temperament, his judgment, and hie
■adaptability. Every time he races he insures himself for
.'£looo, with so much per week in case of incapacitation by
■specific injury. Probably, he will arrange his own f’une-
iral when the time arrives, unless the subject bores him,
in which case, doubtless, he will drop off to sleep before-
hand, to avoid worry. He won the first Austral, the
•Melb. Oup of cycling ; has been favorite for the last two
Australs, and will compete again this time with a 60yds.
handicap. He has had all athletics bad—has been nearly
killed at swimming, boxing, shooting, football, and
•cycling. And it is rather a pity for him that his surplus
energy cannot be bottled up, and distributed among his
iflrm’s branches.
Is it True?
We are used to “tall yarns” from “Yankee-
Iland,” and, in fact, can hardly pick up an Ameri-
can newspaper without seeing an article referring
to some new improbable invention ; a recent dis-
covery ; or some wonderful feat, which, if true,
would command our wonder, astonishment, and
praise. While we would not reflect upon the
veracity of our American cousins, we must in all
■conscience, and in justice to ourselves and readers,
accept many of these statements with a grain or
two of allowance, even if we credit their incon-
■gruity to inaccuracy of cables or typographical
■errors. When we receive a startling statement,
however, of facts occurring, or a discovery made,
in Australia, verified by one of our own country-
men of professional and social standing, we have
no hesitancy in accepting it as “ true.” The
latest and one of the most interesting letters from
a prominent and well-known Australian, Mr. J.
M‘Donald, the well-known artist and sketched
we know represents the truth, and is of personal
interest to all. He writes from Universal Cham-
bers, 326 Collins St., Melbourne, 19/7/97 i
“ About fourteen years ago, when on a visit bo
nay father’s home in Otago, N.Z., I learned that
;a neighbouring farmer’s wife was seriously ill with
Bright’s disease, and that there was little hope of
her recovery. I informed my mother of a remark
made to a friend by a London doctor to the effect
that Warner’s Safe Cure was one of the best
patent medicines for Bright’s disease then in the
market. The information was conveyed to the
patient, who at once commenced taking the Safe
Cure. The result was most gratifying, and three
years ago when again in New Zealand I had the
pleasure of meeting this lady who was then ap-
parently in excellent health. The following is an
experience of my own. A few years ago I suf-
fered severely from ulcerated mouth and throat
occasioned by carelessly moistening my finger on
my lips when counting bank notes. After using
a mixture made up by a chemist, which proved
useless, Warner’s Safe Cure obtained speedy .re-
lief, and ultimately got rid of the trouble.”

PUT TO THE TEST
A Well-Known Sydney Journalist Makes Inquiries,
AND TELLS THE STORY TO “ BULLETIN ” READERS.
u npHOUSANDS of weary feet! We see them daily, dragging along, to and fro, pathetic
J- proof of the worn-out feeling in the bodies that possess them. Thousands of
weary feet, and thousands of correspondingly weary hearts, they go on daily, victims of
one or other of the many forms of General Debility.” . , .
It was the brief introduction to an article in one of the current magazines, and it set a
press-representative thinking. He had on his office-table, among other things, an adver-
tisement setting out the wonderful restorative properties of a well-known medicine as testi-
fied to by Mr. W. H. Cole, late headmaster of Petersham 0. of E. School, and it set him
thinking : “ If this preparation for restoring wasted energy be all that they claim tor it,
how is it that these weary feet go on in their downward course 1 How is it that they do
not seize the chance provided to recover their lost elasticity, and so grow young again . I
was a very natural question for the pressman to put to himself, and it was an equa y
natural answer that immediately suggested itself : “ Because they do not know, because
they do not believe, because they have been deceived so often they hardly care to exercise
their discrimination further.” Suddenly the idea presented itself : How if I should tes
the genuineness or otherwise of this testimony ; how if I should investigate it, and, its
honesty being established, give it the impress of my newspaper, and thereby prove a bene-

most extreme weakness. I slept badly, I ate badly ; I was exhausted when I retired at
night, and utterly prostrated within a few hours of my in the morning.
“ You evidently had got into a bad state of health, then 1 ” . .
“ I had ; and everybody noticed it. I was as weak as could be—nervous and fretful to
a degree—and, what is more, I got worse with each succeeding day.”
“ Why didn’t you see a doctor, Mr. Cole ? ”
“ I’ll tell you what I did, sir. I got so bad at last I started taking patent medicines-
pills and tonics and things—and perhaps in that you would think I was very foolish.”
The reporter smiled.
“ Well, I was both foolish and wise. Foolish, because I tried nearly every tonic on
the market without getting the slightest relief ; and wise, because I didn’t give up my search
for a cure even when disgusted.”
“ Wise, indeed, if you found one, sir.”
“ You shall see. I repeat I had tried almost every tonic on the market, and only to be
disappinted ; but there was one I hadn’t tried, and when at last, acting on (he advice of a
friend, I turned to that, I assure you I had almost lost hope.
“ And that last one cured you 1 ”
“It did, completely ; and never shall I fail to acknowledge it—it saved my going to
pieces.
“ You certainly look the picture of health now, Mr. Cole.”
“ J am 10 years younger as the result of four bottles,” said the relator, stretching his
arms out. “My appetite is good, my nerves are strong, and, I believe,” smilingly, “ that
I would not come off second best even in a tussle with you, who look as ruddy as anyone
could desire.”
“ The weary thousands, then, have only to apply to you, sir, to be told the way to health
and happiness ? ” .
Mr. Cole became serious. “ I would be ungrateful were I not to do whatever lies in
my power to help others.”
“And the name of this wonderful restorative ? ”
“Is Minerva Tonic, sir no other M~I —N E —R — V~A.’’
Spelling out which classical name this most courteous gentleman extended his hand to
wish the reporter good-bye ; and the latter, returning the parting salutation, left in the
satisfaction that he had gained such information, as, being printed, would act upon
thousands, “ Weary, care-oppressed hearts, weary, care-furrowed faces, a service might
be done to sufferers that should not prove the least of a journalist’s claim to a future
reward.”
And with that object this article is printed.
Minerva Tonic is on sale everywhere, and everyone should insist upon getting it.

USE ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT.’
tt is Pleasant, Cooling, Soothing, Health-Giving, Refreshing and Invigorating.
YOU CANNOT OVERSTATE ITS CREAT VALUE IN KEEPING THE BLOOD PURE AND FREE FROM DISEASE.
“A s an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO’S ‘ FRUIT
SALT,* I have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO'S ‘FRUIT SALT’ he now ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it, about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.-I remain, yours faith-
fully, J. W. Neil.”— {From, the late Rev. jf. W. Neil, Holy Trinity Church, North Shields.)
ME AD ACHE and Disordered Stomach.— “ After suffering for nearly
two and a half years from SEVERE HEADACHE and DISORDERED
STOMACH, and after trying almost everything, and spending much money, with-
out finding any benefit, I was recommended by a friend to try ENO’S * FRUIT
SALT,’ and, before I had finished one bottle I found it doing me a GREAT DEAL
of GOOD, and now lam RESTORED to MY USUAL HEALTH; and others I
know that have tried it have NOT ENJOYED such GOOD HEALTH for years.
—Yours most truly, Robert Humphreys, Post Office, Barrasford.”
The effect of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ on any DISORDERED and FEVERISH
condition is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE’S OWN REMEDY
and an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION. —Examine each Bottle, and. see CAPSULE it marked ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT.'
Without it, you have been imposed on by a WOE T//LESS imitation. Prepared only by

POLITICAL POINTS.
If Premier Reid gets his way, the only un-
stamped thing in N.S. Wales will be the mailed
N.S.W. newspaper.
“A noo Guv’ment within a month !” is
what some of the Brisbane (Q.) political prophets
are tearing around to impart.
Rumoured that Reid’s long - forgotten
N.S.W. State Bank scheme may be heard of next
session—just in time to let the Opposition put
both feet on it before the general election.
Native Indian discontent at the cost of
frontier wars, in which the people have no direct
interest, is one of the pressing anxieties of the
Viceroy’s Government. The Indian debt exceeds
JE200,000,000, and the present war will add heavily
to it.
Nelson Govt. (Q.) has dropped M‘II wraith
like a hot potato. Admitted that he was torrid
to hold, would M‘llwraith have dropped a mate
under similar circumstances? Not much. He’d
have fought on his behalf like a cornered rat till
be was “ killed dead.”
Henniker Heaton ridicules the idea of
seven distinct Agents-General for Australasia.
One general representative, he thinks, would quite
fill the bill. “ The people at present occupying
these positions are for the most part simply titles
hunters.” Et tu, Brute?
Premier Reid boasts that he takes his
politics from “ people he meets, and not from
books.” Hence such unconscious theatrical con-
tradictions as a probate-tax, graduated and with-
out exceptions, and his professed admiration of a
land-tax with exemptions and without gradua-
tion.
When Q. Parliament has pensioned off the
ancient Bully Palmer, and Premier Nelson, P.C.,
&c., has taken Palmer’s chair as President of the
Leg. Council, then look mi for a thermal geyser
troubled by deep party -quakes. It looks as if any
week might see an election in Queensland. If
Nelson is party-wise, he will postpone pen sioning
Palmer till next year.
Premier Reid is trying an ingeni-
ous method to keep out the British nigger
and Chinaman, the Imperial Govern-
ment having refused to permit his ex-
clusion simply because he is a nigger or a
Chinaman. The coffee-colored person is to
personally write out and sign, in some European
language, an application to be exempted from the
Operation of the Act. If he can’t do that, clause
111. of the Act will eject him on his ear. The
same Act also shuts out paupers, idiots, criminals,
Persons suffering from certain diseases, and
'lossies, so it looks sufficiently comprehen-
sive. As it doesn’t openly tread on the corn
of the British nigger, but gets there by a
circuitous route, it seems to be understood
that the Imperial Government will let it
go through in a moment of abstraction.
According to Premier Nelson,
M‘llwraith “came to Queensland with
.£60,000 or £70,000. He has now been
down on a bed of sickness for four
years, and is penniless, bed-ridden, and
unable to write.” Then Nelson ap-
pealed to the Labor-party to stop kick-
ing the old man who is down. Yet re-
cent reports have it that MTlwra.lh
is looking rather well and living in com-
fort and apparent affluence ; and even a
penniless man has no right to get away
with £300,000 or so belonging to a set
of shareholders who are now, on the
whole, a great deal more down
than he is, and some of whom are
left without a bed to be bed-
ridden upon. And to people
who remember the masterful
roaring lion that MTI wraith
was when he was up, this
wail for pity sounds in-
congruous.
N. : ‘‘ The boss fools of earth are the
soldiers and the politicians. Graham Berry can-
not get a miserable pension of <£3oo a year, but I
Can point ton. Vic. civil servant, under 50, turned
loose with a pension of <£4oo a year. No wonder
M’sP. envy the Parliament-house messengers, who
heartily despise the members. Berry must be
referred to the Charities Commission or Charity
Organisation Society. I pointed out in these
Columns, months ago, how the Tories were sup-
t>orting his pension and the Liberals opposing.”
Humors of Maoriland Parliament. The
ancient Saunders, member for Selwyn, once char-
acterised a Bill introduced by Reeves as a resur-
rection. “Evidently, it must be,” retorted
Reeves; “it’s brought you up.” Seddon to
Rirani (4ft nothing): “Thehon. member’s imagi-
nation is out of proportion to his size.” Pirani to
Seddon (18st.): “The Premier’s imagination is
not out of proportion to his size.”
That Canadian “loyalist ” Wilfrid Laurier,
whom the Imperial press took so eagerly to its
flat, dry paper bosom, turns out to. be not nearly
so loyal as he looked. One of his most recent
public utterances : “ Canada has passed the period
of pupilage, and has reached that stage when
nationhood is desirable.”
Gregory, M.L.C., is mortally affrighted
that the latest Q. Elections Bill, in shortening the
residence qualification to three months, will
enable a merely residential elector to get his
name on more than one roll just about election
time. But the old man wouldn’t object if Pro-
perty got its name on 40 rolls.
In a return of expenses laid on the tables
of the S. A. Parliament recently, there was a
charge of 13s. for the hire of a cab in which certain
Ministers went to the funeral of Mrs. Catt (wife
of the Chairman of Committees) and 10s. for
another cab which took them to the funeral of the
late Commissioner of Police.
Any Government which employs the Public
Works Committee, at huge expense, to investi-
gate and report on such a proposed work as, say,
Sydney City Railway Extension, and then hangs
the report up unceremoniously, is guilty of such
utterly reckless waste of public money that a vote
of censure could be properly tabled against it.
Australian Federation will much reduce
the number of Imperial decorations given to Aus-
tralian politicians. Canadians visiting this coun-
try are always astonished at the thickness with
which knighthoods are scattered round in the
separate provinces. The reason, of course, is that
at present each is a complete self-governing entity.
The Westralian Leg. Assembly, by a
majority of nearly 2 to 1, pronounces in favor of
payment of members of both Houses. This is as it
should be. The Democracy which pays one
branch of a Legislature and treats the other as an
honorary institution spells self-confusion. Also,
to pay the Upper House would effectually de-
mocratise it.
A provision of the new Yic. Probate Bill
is that banks are to furnish periodical lists of all
deposits and balances which have been unclaimed
for seven years, so that the executors of dead
depositors may have a chance to hear about them.
But why seven years, in the name of all that is
wonderful '! If'Smith dies in 1897 leaving £lOOO
in the bank, and there is no record of it among
his papers, and his heirs have no idea of its exis-
tence,.they simply deposit Smith in the pleasant
bone-yard, and the bank says nothing but keeps
the money. That is the old way. The proposed
new way is that the bank will have to reluctantly
mention the matter in 1904, when Smith’s heirs
and executors have probably vanished to the far
ends of the earth—and, after that, it will presum-

(Then he sooled his doy on the cat, muttered
a heartfelt prayer, and “ got.”)
Maoriland’s fresh issue of postage-stamps
runs away from the eternal Queen’s head ; and
South Australia, too, in the new halfpenny will
adopt a local design.
Labor-leader Glassey, with tears in both
eyes, and sobbing determination in his voice, told
Q. Assembly that he could not hold guiltless of a
knowledge of nefarious Q-N. Bank transactions

of any man loving Sam G.) Then lorn socked

NO CHARGE FOR THIS SUGGESTION.
We have a dull Parliamentary session—a very hungry Treasury
and a funny Premier ; ivhy not the above ?
The Richmond and Tweed are making
signs of want-of-railway distress to Brisbane (Q.),
their natural geographical seaport. The Brisbane-
Southport line will be carried on to the L weed
Heads “as sure as eggs is eggs.” With their awe-
some river-bars, the Tweed and Richmond will
link on to Brisbane, no matter what N.S.W. does
in the way of counteraction.
Land-hunger in Yic. is acute. Whenever
a mallee block is thrown open there is a rush of
applicants. Farfns are changing owners every
week at from <£lo to £6O an acre. At Keilambete
estate sale, near Terang, the other day, 9000 acres
were cut up into 20, 40, 50, 80 acre blocks, and
amidst intense excitement every block was sold
at prices up to <£so an acre. Second-rate country
fetched £l2 and £l4. Most of the buyers were
the local farmers, who knew exactly what they
were doing. The very poorest land found eager
purchasers.
The proposal of Gray, M.L.A., to reduce
to £lOOO the salary of Bard Fitzgibbon, chairman
of Melbourne Board of Works, made Godfrey
Carter’s head swell to nearly twice its natural size
with indignation. “There are some men,” he
said, “ who would not pay the Angel Gabriel
£l5OO a year.” So there are. Carter, himself,
wouldn’t pay Gabriel £l5OO a year, or any other
sum. Neither would any other man. The fate of
the man who even offered to “ grease ” an arch-
angel would probably be too sudden and awful for
description.
Premier Nelson on M‘llwraith :
If he had a chance of an overdraft, he would be a fool if
he didn’t take it. ... A gentleman for whom they all
had the highest respect. ... On a sick-bed, penniless,
bed-ridden. . . . Could not write a line or sign his own
name . . . or even walk. . . . The noble occupation of
the Opposition was to give the sick lion a kick.
This was just after Drury had been sharply
handled by Nelson. But, then, Drury wasn’t sick
or bed-ridden. He was only dead. Thus, again,
the Courier :
It must be admitted that events have proved the Labor-
party was in the right with regard to the Q.N.B.
What an admission from such a quarter !
Recent census of N.S.W. aboriginals gives
3422 full-bloods and 3663 half-castes, showing,
since last year, decrease of 81 in f.b’s. as against
increase of 182 in h.c’s. Amongst f.b’s. have been
137 deaths to 77 births ; amongst h.c’s., 151 births
to 65 deaths. Twelve years ago, f.b’s. numbered
more than twice h.c’s., since when the average
yearly decrease of f.b’s. has been 160, and the
average yearly increase of h.c’s., 86. The black
race, on the whole, is evidently not so much
dying-out as passing into white, and thus is
becoming fulfilled the traditional black man’s
belief “go down blackfellow, jump up white-
fellow.”
Never was the painful inability of the Q.
Labor-party so apparent as during the recent
Q.N.B. debate. Glassey’s attack was rambling,
tedious, fertile of platitudinous invective, barren
of wit, and wanting in point. His lieutenants
followed in the same strain —the plucky ones
wanting the brains and the brainy ones lacking
the pluck. Tozer was superb in his way. He was
by turns horrified, amazed, astounded at the
audacity of people who didn’t believe Nelson and
Barlow pure as the driven snow—and he there and
then publicly and solemnly washed his hands of
the accursed Knight of Auchenflower and all his
works. Then Mat. Battersby grew eloquent of
interjection, was suspended by the Speaker for a
fortnight, and left the House exclaiming: “ Thank
God—l’ll have a rest! ” Even his intellect was
giving way.
H. Duffy goes on, clearing up thing*.
Now he comes to h ,s Cabinet of 72 in winch he
was Premier and this caused the present Vie.

of secular education. I w jn “v, rA, P *

It s a wise politician that
knows his own Bill when it
grows into an Act.
The new N.S.W. Aliens
Restriction Act narrowly es-
caped being’ a measure to facili-
tate the introduction of Asiatics
rather than to keep them out.
it provided that all other
co ored races, not being British
subjects, should be restricted
ni the same fashion as the
Chinese, which would shutout
Africans, Polynesians, Turks,
Persians, Japanese, and the
miscellaneous Malayan tribes,
i hen it added that both among
these tribes and among the
Chinese, ministers,missionaries,
native teachers, tourists, mer-
chants, men of science and
students, and their wives,
families, and servants should
be exempt. Pretty nearly the
whole Syrian crowd, and many
of the Chinese and Japanese,
are merchants, and those tha
t didn’t get in under one or
other of the above headings
would probably arrive as the
14 descendants of some ex-
empted person. But the As-
sembly kicked at the exemp-
tion clause, and it was with-
drawn bodily.
What may be called the immigration clause
of the latest Q. Agricultural Lands Purchase Bill
is rough on Bananalanders. One-fourth of the
land open to selection—all picked, re-purchased
land—is reserved to Cornstalks, Gumsuckers,
Croweaters, &e. After which these applicants
can compete on equal terms with Bananalanders
for the other three-fourths. A great many of
these enquiring “ foreigners(in the provincial
sense) have been grunting that they're not game
to go along to Q. because of the “dasher ” appli-
cations ; because a man who really wants land
gets his sisters and his cousins and his aunts to
dip into the ballot in his interests. The one-fourth
reservation scheme is one of Lawyer Thynne’s
fads.
The official and other mysteries re the
D’Arcy Wentworth (Lucknow, N.S.W.) mine-
lease show that departments mystify Ministers,
Ministers mystify Parliament, Parliament the
press, and the press the public, with the conse-
quence that when a dispute arises days are spent
and reams of paper wasted over wrong issues.
The chief of one department knew lately that the
Minister misunderstood his official information,
but he allowed thelwrong version to go to Parlia-
ment and the country without making the
slightest effort at correction. Another chief
officer, when reproached on a similar count, ob-
served, “ How am I to know that a Minister does
not intentionally misunderstand me? ” But this
last was a case-hardened barnacle.
A well-informed Brisbane correspondent
to The Bulletin
Q. Labor-leader Glasse.v mismanaged the best ci.ance of
his political life by his method of handlng the recent
want of confidence motion in the Q. Assembly. Briefly
stated, his resolution bracketed MTlwraith (“ the gentle-
man not now in Australia ”) with Premier Nelson and un-
portfolio’d Barlow, M.L.C. Armstrong, M.P., moved to
acquit Nelson and Barlow, and took a majority with
him. Then the House—Ministry, their followers and the
Opposition - blackballed MTlwraith unanimously and
even cheerfully. This saved the Government by giving
old Nevermind Nelson time to have advice drilled into his
stubborn old noddle. Had Glassev’s original motion been
confined to kicking out MTlwraith, the chances
are that, in wrath and pseudo-chivalry to a
mate, Nelson would have backed “ the gentleman
not now in Australia ” for all he was worth, would have
made the motion a party' one and would have gone down
badly. As things were, Nelson took up the role of a man
wrongfully accused and who had the utmost contempt for
his accusers. It is well known that his close advisers had
the greatest difficulty to make hi in get on his legs at all
to contribute to the debate. It is said in inner political
circles that whip Hamilton only succeeded “at the
eleventh hour” in getting “ Nevermind ” to see that his
own supporters wanted him to speak. “ What have I got
to say?” retorted Nelson ; “but there, never mind,! I’ll
say something.” And he gave the Opposition banter of the
most humiliating kind. He was a pedagogue teachingdull
scholars. “ I would like you to remember that there are
20 shillings in a£. . . . I have often tried to educate
you, and I still hope to succeed some day.” When inter-
jections were mumbled: “Why don’t you speak up so
that I can hear vou ? What ? Must I go over it all
again ? Well, for the seventh time, then ——” and so on.
It was a remarkable piece of contemptuous irony', and, in
its method of delivery, masterful, since it seemed to
frighten the Opposition into subdued silence. Pitiful 1
Glassev s excuse, and that of his press supporters, was that
Nelson and Barlow were rather more blameworthy than
MTlwraith, and that it would have been cowardly to have
confined the attack to “ the Gentleman Who Is Away-.”
Well, it may have been magnificent, but it was not war. So
soon as the Govt., per medium of Tozer, announced that
MTlwraith was to he dropped (a move had been made by
the Cabinet to get Mac s resignation a day or two before)*
the teeth of the Opposition were drawr But, had
Glassey confined himself to MTlwraith, he would have
raised “ Nevermind’s ” slumbrous mateship, Nelson would
have jumped up to reply, would have spoken “prave
’orts” that would have bound him to stick to MTlwraith,
and the Govt, would have been defeated. When accused
himself, Nelson's main attitude was “ Nevermind.”

Therefore, purchasers of machines fitted with
these tyres and rims need have no anxiety
as to the tyres not fitting the rims properly.
We have now adopted the Dunlop-Wetch Rim
as the standard rim for all Dunlop Tyres, as,
owing to our making them, we are in a posi-
tion to see that the rims are made to the
correct size, and will guarantee every Dunlop
Tyre to fit its respective sized Dunlop- Welch
Rim.

In their desire to gather the spoil, Grafton
(N.S. W.) Anglicans went so far as to sell rosaries
at their recent church-bazaar, which, after all,
only panned-out <£7o, as against £650 raked in at
the local R.C. show.
Dibbs gets home on Reid’s solar plexus
with a loud thump. The Dibbs’ deficit—that
part of it which was really Dibbs’ property—
arose mainly through loss of land revenue,
caused by the abandonment of the practice of
auctioning the public estate wholesale in large and
small lots, to whoever would buy. The new land
policy was approved by the whole Ministry, and
Reid was a member of it. And, as Dibbs alleges,
it is a mean thing for his bygone colleague “to
round upon his old comrade in a good cause.”
The flat refusal of Premier Turner to put
up a penny of public money as a grant to poor old
Graham Berry looks bitterly hard, and Turner
undoubtedly is a hard man. But he is wrestling
with a hard task—that of putting the boom-
finances straight; and the proposed .£5OOO grant
would have made the next surplus totter on its
foundations, and not having the easy gift of filling
the gap with loan funds Turner has to be hard if
he is to be successful. It was finally decided,
with great difficulty and not at all unanimously,
that members and Ministers should put up a suffi-
cient percentage out of their salaries to make up
£l5OO a year for the ancient Tribune. If the
money can be collected there is a lot more real
generosity in this idea than in pensioning Berry
at the taxpayers’ expense. Yet the spectacle of
the dilapidated hat going round periodically, and
the subscription growing smaller and harder to
collect each time, is very melancholy. Five years
hence the Berry collection-hat, when it returns
from its round, will probably have nothing in it
save the lining and somebody’s objurgation.
Two curiously-similar stories of bravery
come from Westralia—one from White Feather
of all places) the other from Mt. Malcolm. At
the Feather, Alfred Hole, losing his grip of the
rope, fell down a 40ft. shaft at the bottom of
which he had just lighted two fuses; and that is
about as tight a place as a stunned man is ever
likely to get out of alive. Charles Hicks, his
mate, instantly made up his mind that Hole
should have all the chances there were, and so
swung himself down the rope ; but, ere he could
pull away the fuses, one shot exploded. Hicks
was dazed and stupefied ; but he hung on to the
rope, and so was hauled to the surface. As it
happened, the second shot was a “ miss ; ” Hole’s
fall had displaced the fuse. But it had also broken
the poor fellow’s neck ; while, as for Hicks, he was
battered and scorched. Of course, the gold-fields
men, swift always to recognise unselfishness, sub-
stantially recognised the heroism of the plucky
mate. In the Mt. Malcolm case there was a
corpse, too —but that is farther out, where family
names don’t count for much ; and so his name is
only “Paddy.” He and his mate Wright were
sinking a shaft and had got six feet down, when
“ Paddy ” was left to fire two holes. One fuse
was stubborn ; the other, which had been lighted,
“jumped,” it is supposed, and before “Paddy”
could get out there was an explosion. Wright
reckoned that, even if his mate was not already
dead the second charge would surely kill him ;
and he also resolved to give him what chances
there were. He was down the shaft and his help-
less mate was thrown out in a few seconds : and
the second charge exploded as he was pulling him-
self out. “Paddy” died; but there wasn’t any
inquiry—a pity ; because fuse that has the habit
of “ jumping ” a few feet wants inquiring into
badly.

CYCLES
are for the better class of Cyclists, those who know the value of a good Machine.
While many firms have devoted their attention to belittling our cycles with the help of
hired barrackers and commission men, we have been working along in our quiet way, and made
friends, and these friends have stuck. As a result, although we are landing 1000 Bicycles per
month, we cannot meet the demand.
This is the result of honest quality and methods recognised by the knowing riders.
We beg to advise those of our patrons whose orders we cannot fill at present that our
November and December SHIPMENTS will contain 2500 Machines, including the famous
RED BIRD SPECIAL. (This machine is in a class by itself).
We trust our friends will bear with us a few days longer, as many months of added
pleasure, the result of being mounted on the best wheel on earth, will more than compensate for
the slight delay.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Ikey Mo (bitterly writes “ Backer ”) is born with
abnormal cheek, and’, as he grows, it grows better and
stronger than any other faculty he has. By the time
he is fully developed he carries around with him a front
that needs a special hoarding to exhibit it. In the case of
bookmakers, the excessive exercise which their leading
characteristic receives gives it still further strength ;
until, at last, it becomes a force that overbears all ob-
stacles. But sometimes this wonderful possession gets
the better of the man, because constant reliance upon
sheer audacity is apt to destroy its possessor’s sense of
proportion in its exercise. And that is how those two
bowled-out Victorian ringmen come to be out in the cold
to-day. To be sure, games as glaring have been carried
off successfully, and nothing was said or done in the
matter. But there was always the danger that the
pitcher might go once too often to the well. Now it’s
smashed at last, and Ikey weeps fruitlessly over the
wreck.

The ex-Queensland champion Battalion put up
a really great performance last week, at Bendigo, where,
in the Sandhurst Cup, he carried the crusher of 10st. 21b.
into second place, giving the winner, Tecoma, no less
than 501 b., and defeating 12 other well - performed
animals.
• • • •
It is printed that the Sydney man who drew
Tecoma in Tatt’s. sweep on the Sandhurst Cup wired to
the owner of the horse offering to lay a third of the sweep,
for each place, to nothing. The manager of the Colonial
Bank at Winchelsea was then called upon to “ make ar-
rangements with the sweep-promoter, who telegraphed
that it was all right.” How comforting for the owner 1

Arnfield and Allen, of Parthen<>paeus fame, are
reputedly worth £40,000 and £20,000 respectively, and
each of them would probably give a big lump of his little
heap for a rescission of his sentence. Sammy used to be
a big backer in the prize-ring, and a great believer in long
Jim Hall. It would be interesting to take the jolly and
fat Sammy’s opinion on the sporting aphorism, “ Never
trust anything that talks.” From all accounts, if the
pair had acted—call it diplomatically—by the jockey,
whose living was taken away in landing their little coup,
the job would never have been sheeted home to them.

The trotting mare Calista’s mile, at Richmond
(Vic.), on a half-mile track, in 2min. 19Jsee., was a great
performance, and her owner uovv talks of a match with
Fritz. The go was a rattling good one, but would be no
use to Fritz. At Bathurst Show, on a half mile track,
Fritz, untrained, trotted a mile in 2.18, the following day
in 2.16, and the next day in 2.16. Air. Buckland drove
the wonder, holding the reins with one hand, and slap-
ping him on the rump with the other.

N.S.W.-bred trotters did well at Canterbury
(M.L.) Carnival week meet. The Childe Harold stallion
Hazeldean, for some time driven about Sydney as a buggy
horse by Mr. M’Kechnie, of Macdonaldtown, won a mile
harness race in 2.47. Beware, a Van Cleve mare, which
ran unsuccessfully at Lillie Bridge, Sydney, a couple of
years ago, trotted two miles in saddle in smin. 21sec. The
little mare .Rita, sometime owned by Mr. Frank Palfrey,
of Sydney, who, to win, would have had to trot better
than 2.30, was only beaten by a length and a-half. The
uncertain pacing mare Hattie S., winner of the champion
prize for trotting mares at last Sydney Agricultural Show,
ran unplaced. Little Millie, by Blackwood from Abdallah,
trotted a mile in sulky in 2.26)4.

Barring “classic” meetings, the racing public
does not seem to “ cotton ” to Randwick. Saturday
afternoon meet proved no exception to the rule. “ Re-
versals of form ” do not agree with the betting crowd,
and it must be confessed that of these they get full
measure at Randwiek. In the Nursery Stakes, Essex,
who carried 101 b. penalty, started an equal favorite with
Vigorous, and looked all over a winner at the distance,
but Lucky Dog, who, on his running at Moorefield on the
previous Saturday, did not seem to have a “possible,’*
cut down the sterling little Essex almost in the last few
strides. Mr. Sam Hordern’s Mirella started a 6 to 4
against favorite for the Club Handicap, and won from
Bona-fide; but, as regards the other races, the prices
speak for themselves : Aboriginal, 6to 1; Town Clock, 8
to 1; Lucky Dog, 12 to 1; and Annadour Bto 1.

A certain Sydney publican, who reckoned he
had drawn Gaulus in Tattersall’s sweep, in the generosity
of his heart made his house free on Melbourne Cup night.
During the evening a friend dropped in to congratulate
him, and asked to see the lucky ticket. The winning
number was there right enough, if the ticket bad been for
the No. 1 drawing. It was for the No. 2, and Mr. Public-
’ouse had the wrong result-list! The bar was speedily
cleared, ’mid much sulphurous language on the part of
the outraged landlord. Just imagine the feelings of a
man who was morally certain for six hours that he had
£6OOO in his grasp, and then found all his dreams shat-
tered in one act, and the old life of giving two tugs to a
beer-engine for 3d. stretching its loathsome vista in front
of him just the same as ever 1

Adelaide bookmakers are up m arms against
Kingston’s Gambling Bill, which will result in the wiping-
out of the tote-comn>issir>n agent. Cohen and co. argue
that they fill a public want as regards the small investors,
who cannot afford to bet directly through the machine in
half-sovs., but the obvious answer to this is a ss. or half-
crown tote.

“The 8 to 1 Acmena, in the mile-andhalf Gat-
wick Handicap, was not thought to have a ‘possible,’
carrying Bst. 131 b. in such a field,” writes Tiik Bullktis’s
London correspondent. “ The 3 to 1 favorite, Carlton
Grange, was only giving her lib., and that settled the
Australian’s chances in the tips of the touts. Yet
Osborne’s mare took the lead a quarter of a mile from
home and finished, in the heavy going of recent rains,
before all the top-weights, but only fourth to one seven-
stoner and two six-stoners. I don’t think he could have
beaten Lord Beresford’s Nonsuch, 7st. 61b., but his per-
formance and those of a few others are fast educating the
English turfites to an unpleasant respect for the antipo-
dean equine.”

V.R.C.—Very Rough Casually.

For the quarter ending Oct. 31, the list of
winning sires is headed by Carbine (£5900), with Lochiel
(£6300) a close second, and Abercorn (£2001) and Trenton
(£1800) next best. However, the current quarter will
show considerable alterations, Gaulus and Grafter having
given Gozo a great lift.

About time Stoddart realised that the country
public plank down their shillings to see scientific cricket.
As it was in the past so it is now. At Newcastle, N.S.W.,
after the local score had been passed, Stoddart confabbed
with Hirst, and then both went in for pure slogging. The
local fielding was execrable, and the bowling ta.me, so
they soon ran into the hundreds. It was magnificent,
but it wasn't cricket. Later on, instead of giving the
public a taste of their bowling strength and trjing to get
the 11 out in the 2) hours remaining, the amateurs all had
a turn with the ball —excepting Stoddart himself. Had
some of the batsmen met the same bowling in club
cricket they’d have burst the ball. As it was, they played
against their opponents’ reputation, and for half-an-hour
at a time all except the batsmen, bowler and the fieldsman
at mid-off might as well have gone for a drink. It was
cricket, but poor sport.
The Giffen controversy lias assumed such dif-
ferent phases that it is difficult to say what is the exact
position just now. The writer has carefully studied all
the newspapers, and he finds that Giffen has a bad knee,
but, under certain circs., the knee can rapidly recover.
Giffen has certainly had a difference with Ben. Wardill,
but, although the’two are considerably estranged just
now, the great George still regards dear old Ben as his
best-loved brother, and is prepareil to weep on his neck
at a week’s notice fcheque enclosed). There is truth in
the rumor that George sticks out for an extra £5O, but it
isn’t a money matter ; George will gladly play, and pay
his own expenses, if necessary, provided the team elects
him captain and allows him to bowl unchanged for three
years—and he’d like to hat for a similar period without
being given out. And yet people talk learnedly about
“ the Giffen difficulty.”
• * • *
There is a growing impression that Geo. Giffen
only did what all the other professional-amateurs should
have done as regards matches with the English Eleven —
refuse to play for a grab-all management. Giff., viewed
in this light, begins to look like St. George fighting the
capitalistic dragon.
* • * *
Darling has so far been quite out of batting
form, and has failed in electorate as well as big matches.
One result has been that he has lost confidence. S.A.
selectors, by the way, learnt one lesson in the match
against Victoria. In the past, players have been dropped
on one failure. Evans, a young player, has been perse-
vered with, and came out with 5 for 35 in the second
innings, when the S.A. bowling looked like being collared.
* • * *
In the four Vio. Cricket Association pennant-
matches, began last Saturday afternoon, the totals, after
about four hours’ play, were : Melb., 293 for six wickets,
against S. Melb. ; E. Melb., 400 for three wickets, against
Carlton ; N. Melb., 346 for nine wickets, against Hawks-
bnrn ; St. Hilda, 317, all out, against Richmond. A grand
total of 1356 runs for 28 wickets. For E. Melb., Harry
Stuckey is 206 not out; and for N. Melb., his brother
George, 72 n.o. Charlie M’Leod made 136 for M.C.C.
Other interprovincial and international men who scored
heavily were : M’Michael 89, Harry 63, Bruce 62, Trurn-
ble 50.

“ Long Tom ” Rockemin Richardson may yet
be the founder of a school of bowlers in Australia. At a
club pennant match in Melbourne, the other day, it was
noticeable that two bowlers on one side had developed
the long Richardson gallop up to the wicket, and the
Richardson delivery. But they managed to keep a more
consistent “ length” than Thomas.
• • * •
The 400 for three wickets made by East Melb.
v. Carlton last Saturday took exactly four hours, and
each hundred was hoisted at the end of each hour to the
minute.

The Mayor of Brisbane, welcoming the English
Eleven, expressed a hope that it wasn't a Queenslander
who sneaked Sloddart’s watch on the previous night.
Stoddy seemed rather indifferent as to the birthplace of
the marauder.

The match between the Englishmen and com-
bined team, Queensland and N.S.W., resulted in a draw
on Monday last, the game standing ; England, 636 ; com-
bined 13, 8 wickets for 316. The latter team was more
N.S.W. than locr.l, no less than seven of the men who
batted hailing from the mother province. The Cornstalks
Included two such old time warriors as “Sammy” Jones
and “ Charley ” Turner. There was a first-class wicket,
on which M’Laren rolled up 181 and Druce 126. Young
Pye’s effort was watched with interest, and the colt came
out of the ordeal in brilliant style with 55, which, on. top
of his 166 against Queensland last year, cannot allow of
his being overlooked for selection when next N.S.W.
needs representation in first-class cricket.
• * * •
Maclarcn, who holds the world’s record for
highest score in first-class cricket—424 against Somerset-
shire —seenfs to have about the best show of securing the
average of the tour. It will be a terrible blow to Ranji.’s
bnrrackers if a mere white plebeian beats their Injun
Prince.
• • * *
“ Cricket Critic ”; It is very evident that, with
a fair share of luck, the Englishmen will win the
majority of the test-matches, owing to their undoubted
superiority in catching. Just look at the matches already
played—Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and now at Bris-
bane. While the home teams consistently miss catches,
the visitors snap up nearly every possible catch offered by
their opponents; in fact, in the Sydney match I don’t
believe the Englishmen dropped one “ possible ” during
the two innings ! It won’t do to give men like Ranji or
M’Laren two or three “ lives.” The innings of the former
at Adelaide and the latter at Brisbane are object-lessons.
Both were missed before they’d scored ! Result, over 180
a-piece at the finish. By the way, Ranji, so far, is the
only Englishman who has made 100 runs or more without
a chance—viz., in the second innings against N.S.W.
• * * *
Even bad and vacillating judging, ignorant
refereeing, and all-round execrable otfieialing of the
L.V.W. sports, last Saturday, failed to spoil the meeting,
and the racing was perhaps the best yet seen in Mel-
bourne. The big scratch Cyclone Plate consisted of three
events—one mile, three miles, and five miles—all of which
distances fell to Green, with “ Newhaven ” Jackson and
Walne second and third respectively. The judges cer-
tainly said that Jackson won the second event, but they
were*really all out. Each race was won in the same way.
Green, who rode magnificently in the mile, after being
blocked at the bell, scooped round on the outside, while
Jackson and Walne battled all they knew for second
place. Barden, the open-mouthed Britisher, finished last
in his preliminary of the mile, and fourth in the three
miles, and was altogether sadly disappointing.
The second-class two miles pave a splendid
finish, A. J. Berry, from 10yds., winning- in great style,
with a dozen on his wheel. Judges gave Hickox second
and L. M. Jackson third, but after a brief argument with
March evidenced their backbone by substituting his name
for that of Hickox. The third-class fell to H. Q. Hill, off
10yds., and was again a fine finish. Owing to the an-
nouncement that no winners would be penalised in the
Austral events, nearly all were triers, though Kellow
stood down for the rest of the afternoon for inconsistent
riding in his heat of the Cyclone Mile. This decision, or
even something more, could have been understood on
Kellow’s riding the previous Saturday, but that he did
wrong in the Cyclone Plate was apparent to nobody but
the ref'-ree.
On Saturday’s riding, none of the scratch men
should have a ghost of a show against W. C. Jackson in
the Austral. The Avoca man starts from 65yds.,and that
he can make his pace is amply shown by his riding in last
year’s Austral. “ Newhaven” will be a warm member for
the big race.
• • * •
Bilmartin still sticks to his training, and it is
whisperer! that the gentle William intends shortly to try
and be reinstated as an amateur. The spectacle of Bill
bursting himself for a J 2 trophy negotiable for about
Is. 6d. would be the most comic incident the Australian
track has ever seen.
• • * •
Bilmartin has started operations as a cycling
punter, and, at Melb. Friendly Societies track, on Satur-
day raked in many dollars. With a camera over his
shoulder, Bill collected £3o—he won on Green-and
walked along the front of the stand shovelling it out of
his hat in handfuls.
* * * *
Occasionally Nemesis gets home on the cycling-
record fiend, and the hearts of the godly rejoice. One
Tipper left Sydney G.1’.0. t’other day in a violent hurry
armed with a certificate given by somebody, to attempt
the futile asininit.v of riding a bicycle to Melbourne
quicker than any other cycle crank —whereupon sensible
people at once went to their news-agents and cut off
their daily papers for a week to avoid the progress tele-
grams. But when, next day, it was recorded that Tipper
was tipped into the Bargo River (good old Bargo !), all
Sydney shook hands with itself and went out and had a
drink. But Tipper wouldn't take the hint. lie started
again next day from Sydney, and to the great delight of
the unprincipled rode into Yass a mass of cuts and
bruises, and resolved to rest a week in the hospital. The
writer doesn’t know Tipper from a crow, and doesn't
want to, and in his capacity as Tipper wishes him no
harm, but as a cycling record-breaker may he always
meet with a Bargo, and find a cot in the Yass hospital 1

Australians who know anything of the game
.did not, expect Joe Goddard to stand much show against
Sharkey. Goddard ever depended upon his power of
taking punishment and his stamina to pull him through,
and a man who fights in that fashion is no good after the
first blush of yout'i and strength. Mick Dooley and Joe
Choynski both got their rights on to Goddard, bringing
him down ; but he pulled round and beat them by main
strength. As Sharkey has all Goddard’s old-time devil,
with science added, the sailor-man’s victory over the
worn-out slogger was a foregone conclusion.

The. Johnston’s Bay (Sydney) Sailing Club’s
22ft. race to decide upon the boat to represent the club
at Brisbane, Q., proved a big set-to between the Vigilant,
sailed by VV. Read, and the Effie, sailed by Nick Johnson.
First one boat and then the other took pride of place,
Vigilant ultimately winning by the small margin of 20sec.
By her win her owner takes £lB, a trophy, and £l5 sub-
sidy if she goes North.
* • * •
Sydney boat-owners very properly protested
against the 22ft. and 18ft. races being sailed on the same
day at Brisbane (Q.) Carnival, as it was not to be expected
that separate crews would be sent up with each boat.

An Austral dream. A well-known member of
the Melbourne bicycle trade had a dream as to the re-
sults of the Austral Wheel Race heats and final. The
dreamer “distinctly saw’’the following men placed in
their respective heats Beauchamp (Tasmania), Walne,
Green, D. J. Walker, A. Turner, K. Lewis, H. Reynolds,
H. James, W. Elliott, Hourigan, and C. Kellow; the
remainder of the placed men in the heats he is not sure
of. In the final the result was Don Walker, Walne, A.
Turner and 11. James in a bunch ; then some few yards
off came K. Lewis, Kellow, Elliott, Green, and Reynolds.
The details of the whole race were given with such clear-
ness that it will be interesting to watch whether the race
and dream agree in any particular.
THE REASON OF IT.
In the science of cutting and driving
And banging the bowling about,
Or by marvellous field-work contriving
To bustle big run-getters out,
He is great, I admit, but the others
Are likewise —now what is the cause—
Him with praise while the crowd fairly smothers,
The rest gain but seamy applause?
I can solve you your riddle ; the reason
Is as plain as the sun in the sky ;
Its drift you'll immediately seize on
When 1 cite you the how and the why.
Those who cheer him so wildly eestatio
And such grovelling homage evince,
Are the holders of views democratic,
And Ranji—well, Ranji's a Prince.

Mr. Frank Senior, who has been chemist
to the N.S. Wales Governors for many years past,
has conferred a blessing upon the citizens of his
country by discovering a wonderful cure for head-
ache. The new remedy cure's instantaneously, is
very palatable, and perfectly harmless to both
ladies and gentlemen. Moreover, it is perfectly
effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-

> A carious thing in Melbourne’s commer-
cial social life is the inevitable rally of the same
old, free-drinking fraternity at every dispensation
of free drinks. The other week there was a
fathering of the dan at Menzies’ Hotel to sample
‘ol Roger champagne. The invitations were sup-
posed to have been issued to press paragraphists
and “representative” persons likely to advance,
by some means or other, the interests of the new
fizz, yet tlie crowd where the corks were flying
thickest included all the familiar faces of men
who are “representative” only of the thirst that
slakes itself gratis on such occasions. The men
who smell champagne from afar, as vultures scent
carrion, and are not even grateful for the liquor
they soak themselves with. Pol Roger is a light,
dry, palatable wine, of the kind that leaves no
headachey after-effeot, therefore the “push,” as a
rule, raised the negative objection that it didn’t
make them sufficiently unsober. These hardened
experts believe in getting drunk on the premises,
and as critics they should confine themselves
strictly to beer.*

Let every good citizen read the Suffield
case pamphlet—post free from Bulletin Office, 7d.
The Bulletin will be glad to receive, for
publication, from all quarters, tersely-expressed
comments on the Suffield case —which it regards
as involving one of the most cruel injustices ever
perpetrated by law in Australia. The case is
forcefully set forth in Mr. A. G. Stephens’
pamphlet, published by The Bulletin and post-
free from this office for 7d. in stamps.
The National Cash Register Co. has estab-
lished itself in Australasia under the able manage-
ment of Mr. W. A. Lingham. The central deprtt
at 393 George-street, Sydney, is handsomely fur-
nished, lighted, and arranged ; the facilities for
buyers are a most pleasing innovation on Austra-
lian commercial practices, and will afford a big
lesson to the Australian business public. The
National Cash Register itself, with its highly-
polished metal case and figured keys, is one of the
most useful and attractive inventions of the age.
It records the number of purchasing customers,
the amount paid by each ; gives out a properly-
dated and perfectly accurate receipt, and shows at
a glance the till’s total contents. It correctly adds
from to thousands of. pounds, makes fraud
impossible, saves labor, money, time, Worry, and
responsibility.*
The forthcoming number of the Anti-
podean magazine will be edited by A. B. Paterson
and Geo. Essex Evans, and published by Geo.
Robertson and Co. early in Dec. —price, one
shilling. With further reference to a statement
made in this paper’s issue of 20th November, to
the effect that “ the projected re-issue of the An-
tipodean was nearly falling through for want of
advts. tothepublishingguarantors’minimum,”THE
Bulletin is assured that as a matter of fact the
Antipodean, being published by the well-known
firm of Geo. Robertson and Co., does not depend
on advertising for its existence, and the fact that
it has secured a large amount of advertising is not
to be wondered at when it is seen that the list of
contributors embraces most of the best-known
Australian writers, many of them old Bulletin
contributors. In the forthcoming issue “Rolf
Boldrewood” discourses on “Black Trackers”;
Brunton Stephens, who has been so long metri-
cally silent, furnishes a poem, “The Chamber
of Faith ” ; Henry Lawson details his experiences
as master of a Maori native school; “The Banjo”
furnishes a further instalment of the adventures
of “Saltbush Bill”; Ethel Turner has a story,
“ Golden Syrup ” ; Clement Wragge narrates in
simple language how to tell your weather for
weeks ahead ; Essex Evans furnishes verse; and
several other well-known writers aid in making
up a publication that should achieve the success
which The Bulletin cordially wishes it.
Before last week’s no confidence motion in
Q. Assembly, Labor-leader Glassey: “I have no
hope of carrying it, but I must put myself right
with the country.” Words best left unsaid. No
leader of a forlorn hope tells his men that the hope
is forlorn.

THE AGED.
Forty-five “gentlemen in divided skirts,’'
as the writer once heard a lady put it, were con-
victed in Maoriland during ’96 of desertion from
British warships.
N. : “The Melbourne Cemetery is a
favorite lounge of lovers on summer nights, and
has to be kept locked, with notices against climb-
ing over the palisading, or the song would be
‘Tombstones in the Dark.’”
“R.H.” to The Bulletin :
Miles of Urana, and Narandera stock-routes are
at present being cleared and ringbarked by Govt, camps
of Sydney unemployed ; but unless these routes are
securely fenced off or other stringent measures taken to
protect the struggling drovers and prevent pastoralists
running stock on them, the money so expended will
have been absolutely thrown away—even if this isn’t
merely another roundabout way of playing into the hands
of squattocratic Fatman.
T.P. : “You pointedly show in a recent
issue that Auckland has contributed nought, or
next to nought, to the statesmanship of Maori-
land. With shame, I, an Aucklander, admit the
justice of the gibe. Auckland, the qiieen city of
Maoriland, the seat of a university, the centre of
culture - Auckland, hopelessly mediocre and
* retail ’ in sentiment, is content now to be repre-
sented by Crowther (a retired livery-stable man),
Holland (a retired carpenter), and Thompson (a
retired grocer). And Auckland, Pecksniffian,
bourgeois, narrow and lodge-ridden, deserves no
better representation than it lias got.”
; It is refreshing to note from the new
biography of Tennyson that in his earlier years,
ere he was spoilt by adulation, the poet had a
frank contempt for titles. Monckton Milnes, in
18.17, asked him to contribute a poem to a sort of
keep-sake volume the Marquis of Northampton
(who, by the way, has just died) was editing.
Tennyson wrote back refusing, and in his letter
said, “ To write for people with prefixes to their
names is to milk he-goats ; there is neither honor
nor profit.” (Vol. 1., p. 158.) Monckton Milnes
wa j* J" I *'*’ re f usa l)” says the biographer,
and Tennyson sent him a poem to soothe him.
And yet he became a titled he-goat himself !
A very important matter to the N.S.W.
public is the recent modification of the informer-
rewarding system, so that any person for the
f"t u . re giying information about smuggling or
illicit distillation will not have to chance receiving
a P°rti°n of a money penalty, but will be certain,
in addition, of a specific reward, even where the
offender elects to “ take it out.” This arrangement
means a death-blow to the local manufacture, by
clumsy amateurs with defective appliances, of
hell-water so horrible that its producers can never
be induced to put lip to it themselves—even in
gaol. The great bulk of smuggled spirit, also, is
simply too vile to be worth paying duty upon, and
altogether, though the informer may be an evil,
the wholesale brain-blasting of the alcohol-using
community is an infinitely greater one. The first
s y-groggery nailed under the new regulations in-
cluded in its plant a contrivance intended to super-
sede the “ worm ’’—apparently no longer “the
worm that dieth not.” The informer’s unobtru-
mve finger, by-the-way, may, in this instance, be
distinctly traced in the fact that a batch of Syd-
ney policemen were able to go straight to where
the poison was being made in the solitudes of
Cowan Creek, Hawkesbury River.


The Celebrated Danish Herbalist,

Proprietor of tlje ALFALIN6 N€RBAL R€M€PI€S (Registered.)
Has much pleasure in presenting to the Public the following overwhelming evidence of the great virtues
his REMEDIES contain.
Testimonials.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
course of your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, I consider you are deserving of
success, whioh I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
fully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney BULLETIN, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus: To Hetr Rassmussen. —Dear
Sir, —I think it my duty to inform you that, a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Much-valued Testimonial from one of
Australia’s Most-Prominent Explorers.
Grand Hotel, Spring-st., Melbourne,
March 7th, 1895.
To Herr R*ssmus>kn,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform you that
I have derived great benefit from your celebrated Alfaline
Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. HUTTON
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).
Witness: A. F. heker, Manager, Grand Hotel, Spring-
street, Melbourne.
Mr. Button writes later:- “The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wa"garatta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.
—Yours truly,
WILLIAM HANSON,
Cycle Agent and Tobacconist,
Narrandera, N.S.W.

Herr Rassmussen. 9/3/97.
Dear Sir,—lt gives me great pleasure to inform you that
your Alfaline Liver and Kidney Pills completely cured me
of a severe affection of the liver and kidneys. I found my

teacher of singing, but I am very pleased to say that all
my pains are gone, and all my former vigor and strength
have returned, and I feel like a new man. I may say that
before taking your Pills I had a great lump on the live,
which could be felt from the outside, and which com
pletely disappeared as soon as I took your Pills. You at

Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised

complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l

DYSPEPSIA and its treatment is receiving
much more than a share of attention from the
medical journalistic world. The British Phar-'
maceutical Journal has published an article of
about four pages by the well-known Professor
Finkler, going into a series of experiments com-
paring papain as a digestive ferment with pepsin,
and, in nearly every case, the papain results are
the most favorable. After showing the results of
the experiments, he winds up the article as fol
lows :
Pepsine acts in. the stomach, and not in the
intestines, as in the latter the reaction is neutral or
alkaline. Papain has little effeot in the stomach,
as the reaction there is acid ; when, however, the
stomach is neutral or alkaline, papain will pep-
tonise, while pepsine will be useless. The degree
of acid reaction in the stomach varies greatly,
especially in the case of a stomach out of order, in
which case the reaction can be so highly acid or
alkaline that pepsine would be of no value at all.
I’or the treatment of stomach catarrh we will,
however, find that as a general rule the contents
of the viscus have been rendered artificially neu-
tral or alkaline by the administration of remedies,
so that in these cases pepsine will have absolutely
no effect. Papain, on the contrary, will act ener-
getically. Regarding the time available for the
digestive ferment to act in the body, in the case of
pepsine this is necessarily very short, as the action
ceases when the food enters alkaline reaction of
the intestines. In the case of papain, which can
act well in alkaline reaction, the time is prac-
tically unlimited, as it continues acting on the
food during the whole time it remains in the body.
For all these reasons the conditions for the effect
in the human body are far more in favor of papain
than pepsine, and especially as under existing
circumstances (high degree of concentration) pap-
pain has been shown to act more energetically.
It is only too clear that the preference should be
given to papain as a digestive ferment for the
treatment of dyspepsia. Besides for dyspepsia,
the papain is of great importance in the treatment
of diphtheria. Its effective power consists in the
circumstance that no free acid need be present in
the application, and, further, that the moisture D f
the diphtheric membranes is quite sufficient to
allow the ferment to dissolve the solidified sub-
stance of the membranes. No other ferment has
so far been able to obtain these results. It is on
this account that many competent experimentalists
and specialists have lately made observation as to
these points. From all these circumstances there
is no doubt that in papain we have a ferment
which has a great future before it, and it is for
this reason that I have made a special study of the
manner of preparing the papain. I have had the
satisfaction of obtaining the most favorable results
from its use in the treatment of disease.”
The Extra Pharmacopaeia, page 305, says
that Papian is the dried juice of the Paw Paw
(Carica Papaya,) and goes on to show its medioal
value. Ihe Medica& Annual of the current
edition also publishes a long article on the fruit
ferment Papain from the Paw Paw, and quotes
from an American work the Poltclinic, of June,
1896, showing the very beneficial results obtained
from the use of Papain in cases of indigestion,
proving that its digestive power, while in the sys-
tem, is greater than any other ferment known.
In a supplement to Chambers Encyclopaedia
Papain is described as follows“ Papain is a
Nitrogenous Body, isolated from the juice of the
tropical Paw Paw. ... The juice has for a
long time been used in the West Indies for
making meat tender; but it has only recently
been shown that Papain possesses, like Pepsin
and Trypsin, the power of digesting meat fibre,
and this digestion will go on in an alkaline, a neu-
tral, or an acid solution. Hence, it belongs to the
group of Digestive Ferments, and, like them, is
employed in cases of Dyspepsia, or employed for
the predigestion of food.”
The proprietor of the Cairns Preserving Works,
noting the great digestive ability of the Paw Paw
Fruit, which grows prolifically in North Queens-
land, has manufactured a delicious table sauce
from it. All the principal grocers sell it. This
digestive tropical novelty is receiving much atten-
tion.*

There’s very little doubt that the con-

a woman in the expectation that, as one person
cannot be guilty of conspiracy, and as the woman
will probably be considered to have been a mere
tool of the man, both will be acquitted. The
oracle didn’t work in this case, however —both

French savant Jayle lately (according to
the Presse Medicale) showed Paris Anatomical
Society a collection of rabbit and guinea-pig does,
whose present ovaries were not their own. Some
of the rabbits contained ovaries originally belong-
ing to other rabbits, while the ovaries of some had
been transplanted from guinea-pigs. Even so with
the guinea-pig does, some of which were wearing
ovaries transplanted from rabbits. He proposed
next to endeavor to artificially fecundate what
might be called “ rabbitised ” guinea-pigs with
rabbit semen, and “ guinea-pigised ” rabbits with
guinea-pig semen, and then await results. The
idea behind the experiments is to test the law of
the mutability of species, and to see whether
hybrids likely to be of great commercial use may
not perhaps be producible in this artificial way.
It happened in Barataria. The magistrate
was an enthusiast about skittles, and there was a
great interprovineial skittle-match on, but, un-
happily, there was a long and lingering case to be
heard, and the P.M. sat disconsolately, dreaming
of skittles, eating his finger-nails, and wondering
how on earth he was going to get away to that
game of nine-pins, whilst the lawyers and wit-
nesses fought it out among them on the floor of
the court. But Heaven does hear and answer
prayer: suddenly the P.M. saw his opportunity.
Defendant had committed an act of contempt—a
small, unimportant manifestation of derision, but
enough ; and the law rose up against him in the
person of a furious magistrate and smote him hip
and brisket. Never was a magistrate so righteously
indignant before, or so determined to uphold the
dignity of the court. Forty-eight hours in the
cells was the order. Protestations, auologies, ex-
planations, all were vain; the P.M. would not
forgive, neither would he go on with the case, and
send the arch-offender up on the rising of the
court. Instantaneous and complete vengeance
was called for, and defendant went sadly up.
Ten minutes later the court was placidly over-
looking the great interprovineial game of skittles.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at it*
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing l cough, difficulty of breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
arid immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a com-
plete cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and
irritation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic.
No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning,
a dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is
certain. *
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking'two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful,
and shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends. —
Yours truly, E. SMITH, Ilalpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“After suffering from Asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which
was in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not
had the slightest return of it. The Medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.
—ALEX. J. ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ft’s precious hard, by thunder 1 to see that colt
come sailing
Down the straight, and land a winner, when I
should have had the mount,
If the stewards hadn’t fancied I’d a hand in Nero s
failing,
And stood me for a twelvemonth, just to settle
my account.
I oan feel the hot blood tingle as they sweep
around the railing;
How the gay silks flash and shimmer ! Just take
this from me, old pard,
I rode that finish fairly, and the colt was beaten
squarely,
Yet I’ve got to stand beside you and remember
lam “barred.”
Like the jockey barred from racing, there are folk
in every station
Who long with endless longing just to follow
Nature’s trend,
Who hate the toil they live by —but it’s that or
else starvation,
So they do their daily penanoe till life’s penal-
ties shall end.
But they often wonder dimly as they eat Care’s
meagre ration
Were they born ’neath astral bodies, with their
fortunes evil-starred.
They pass life watching ever for the day that
cometh never,
And asking why they’re branded as the God-for-
gotten “barred.”
It may be lack of money—it may be lack of
learning—
That fetters them forever to a life of barren toil.
That chains the men and women who for higher
things are yearning,
To a small and fetid workroom, or the blank and
barren soil.
Oan ye wonder Nature’s problem is too deep for
man’s discerning ?
Oan ye wonder that he pictures God a tyrant,
fierce and hard ?
If ye can, then ye have felt not those ioy chains
that melt not,
And bind in cruel bondage the ambitions of the
“ barred.”
Ah, it’s bitter, bitter, bitter, when the years are
swiftly rushing,
And day by day, and week by week, no brighter
chance unfolds ;
When all Youth’s dreams of rosy hue that Hope’s
soft clouds were flushing
Fade out, and skies of steely gray are all the
future holds.
They are banned, and jeered, and flouted, with the
mace of Plutus crushing
Each honest effort they can make, with tempers
wrung and jarred ;
With spirits seared and broken, they hear their
sentence spoken:
“ From the choicest joys of living ye are barred,
barred, barred ! ”
It is true they have their freedom, and they oan, if
they are willing,
Surrender toil and spend their lives in seeking
what they crave.
But the noble souls I sing of, to the calls of duty
thrilling,
Will tramp the dreary treadmill till it endeth
in the grave. .
Is it strange a sceptic feeling with its frosty
breath is chilling ,
The faith of those who quit this world with
marks of conflict scarred !
And they ask, when they have perished, if the
last faint hope they’ve cherished
Will be met with grim denial, and they still must
be the “ barred. ”
Maoriland.
C.HARVIE.
An Impressionist Outline.
(AFTER THE NEWEST MASTERS.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Girl sat on the green slope of the bank
where it dipped down to the tennis-court. She
was eating’ Grass.
The Man stood beside her with the toe of his
right foot tapping impatiently against the heel of
his left. In fact, he stood on one leg. Or, to be
absolutely accurate, he stood on one foot. And
that his left foot.
The Grass which the Girl was eating was Prairie
Grass; it was thick, dull, green, stringy and
sharp-edged. The blades of it swelled out in the
middle and thinned towards their sides. She ate
the same piece of grass all the time. She did not
swallow it. She held the stalk of it in the fingers
of her right hand, and the pallid, green-tinted sap
oozed in infinitesimal drops along the bitten edge
of the stalk.
Her left hand rested upon the bank behind her
and she leaned her weight on it. Her face was
down-bent, and the red and black band on her
sailor-hat made a vivid touch of color in the green-
ness of the background, and the whiteness of her
serge frook.
(The man still stood on one foot.)
* * * •
Above, in the distance overhead, stretched
the sky, tender, rose-tinted, illimitable. Little
baby clouds went rolling themselves over and
over across its deepening fallows, little grey clouds,
with their western edges tipped with amethyst,
and rose, and amber. They played among them-
selves up there in the great sky-stretches, and the
sun sent a last smile over them as he passed down
lingeringly below the horizon’s edge.
Eastward, there were shadows that roamed
westward slothfully, and seemed loth to blur the
gleaming fields of the sunset sky.
And towards the city red lights not lit by
Nature began to make their star-like points of
color where streets and houses were colorless as
man had made them.
By-and-bye the sky faded ; the rose and amber
and amethyst melted into a misty mauve, the
mauve paled into a grey. When the stars came
out they lit the grey into a dark-toned blue. All
the red shades disappeared.
The Girl still ate her Grass.
• * * *
The air was utterly still, and after the sun -
had set it grew sweet with the evening odors of
flowers. The violets along the borders of the
garden-beds, and under the camphor-laurels and
Chinese lantern trees, breathed out a united frag-
rance that seemed to melt into the dusk and
sweeten all the air right up into the ether.
Down by the creek a mist was rising, and the
wattles, with all the light gone out of the golden
burrs, sighed and .sighed through the paddocks
till all the world was one vague, sweet, arrowy
wattle-breath.
And then there were the little red gums that
clustered together in the bush in the background ;
their odors were dreamy, wholesome, not so sweet
as the wattle, perhaps, but calming, and sugges-
tive of a wide country with great trees, and free
winds, and a sky made of one perfect turquoise.
* * * 9
All the birds were asleep. The coach bird
had ceased the musical ’swithl’ of his notes, so
reminiscent of a coach-whip’s lash, and slept in
the valley near the ground. The laughing jackass
was dreaming with his head under his wing. The
tiny blue wren, whose brilliant turquoise caught
every sparkle of the sunlight in the daytime, was
at rest under some gum-tree’s leaf. The parro-
quets, who had jabbered all day in restless flocks,
were silent at last. The little black and white
fly-catcher, with his flirty tail, had settled in still-
ness on the branch of a great eucalyptus. All
their notes were hushed.
• * * *
But the crickets were singing everywhere.
When the birds ceased the crickets began. Their
crisp brown bodies lay under the grass like little
bits of burnt stick. But though they were so
near, it was hard to gather them into one’s hand,
even ever so tenderly. They sing right under
your eyes, but you cannot see them. You search
just where their song was, but you cannot feel
them.
• • * »
A great, hairy, yellowy-brown spider, with
white and black and grey specks on him, was
throwing a net from one geranium-bush to another.
The Man hit at him with his tennis racquet. He
fell on the grass, and his ash-liued legs and arms
disappeared suddenly, and instead of a great hairy
yellow-brown spider there was a little motionless
dark ball. He was not dead. He was only
soheming a spider scheme.
* • * •
Flying-foxes smelt the peaches in the orchard,
and ’ flapped themselves with straight swirls
through the air. In the lovely fruit-bloom of the
peaches little cruel holes made their appearance.
The beauty of the bloom was shattered by the
beasts’ sharp teeth and hot, hungry breaths.
• * * *
Two men wandered down the road. One
was smoking a comely, rich cigar. He wore a red
velvet smoking-cap, with a tassel. These caps
went out of fashion six years ago. The women
who did the crewelwork on them hope they will
never come in again.
♦ * * *
And now, having exhausted grass, sky,
clouds, the air, the violets, wattle, redgums, the
coachbird, the laughing-jackass, the bluewren, the
parroquets, the flycatchers, the crickets, spiders,
flying-foxes, and the other people, we return to
our impressionist outline.
The girl was still eating Grass. It was nearly
finished.
The man stood on his other foot.
M.LOUISE MACK.
More than half the water which flows from
Beetaloo Reservoir (the second largest in S.A.)
into the mains is wasted in some unaccountable
way. The quantity for which no payment was
received last financial year was 270 million gals. !
Yet the public wonder why the discrepancy be-
tween maintenance and interest charges and
revenue is <£22,500 annually. After quietly sub-
mitting to this loss for years, Govt, is now trying
to find out where the water goes to.
Agricultural Northern S.A. is in a
droughtier state than it was last year, when seed
wheat had to be supplied to hundreds of farmers.
Many of them will not harvest even as much as
they sowed. It is seriously proposed that Govt,
and private benefactors should not prolong the
agony of these settlers, but should just let them
be starved out to more suitable country. To meet
that, Foster, farmers’ M.P. —also a storekeeper—
has gathered statistics showing that from the
affected country, between Petersburg and Hookina,
088,105 bushels of wheat were trucked in 18!) >, and
522,770 bushels so lately as 1894, And he .-isks, of
course, can the province afford to lose it ? What a
gamble it is, though, is shown by the other figures
that in 1889 the export was but 100,050 bushels,
and in 1890 but 203,781. In the far West of
N.S.W. too, this season promises to be droughtier
than last. Only enough rain fell there to start
herbage, which, unlike grass, disappeared with the
first half-dozen hot days.
Save that sold under one or two unim-
peachable trade-labels, there is no absolutely pure
olive-oil to be bought in Australia. Ninety-nine
hundredths of the so-called “olive-oil” of com-
merce is merely refined cotton-seed oil more or
less mixed with olive. The South Australian
article, in the opinion of cosmopolitans of wide
experience, is as good as any in the world, and
the London opinion that it is merely a “ good
lubricant ” proves either that the expert was an
ass or that, as often happens, the Australian pro-
ducer has been trying to cut his own throat by
not submitting a first-class sample in first-class
condition. Anyone who uses the South Aus-
tralian oil for salad purposes is quite unlikely to
designedly use any other.
“ Serang ” from Gippsland Lakes en-
trance :
Editor Bulletin,—The inducement of netting in the
Gippsland Lakes has caused men to settle with their
families at the Lakes’ entrance, and has made the place a
centre entirely dependent on the labor of fisher-
men. Minister Best, however, has recently issued a pro-
clamation closing the waters in the vicinity of the Lakes’
entrance, thus depriving the men of their living when-
ever it is rough outside. No doubt this is the result of
representations made by disappointed anglers—probably
unaware that the fish usually caught in the closed wafers
come in and go out with the tide, and only make their
appearance at certain seasons of the year. An exodus of
the fishermen will have to take place unless the restriction
is removed, as this place is, at best, a poor struggling
village locally known as “ Corpse Town,” and—minus the
fishermen—highly decomposed at that.

|| prominent Newcastle Resi-

Had a Disease that Baffled
Leading Physicians.
TINY TONIC PILLS AGAIN
TRIUMPHANT.
(Full Investigation by the Newcastle Evening
Times.)
A very well-known and highly-respected resi-
dent of this district (says the Newcastle Times)
is Mr. Thomas Rowe, of 130 Darby-street. He
has been in the colonies about 40 years, a few of
the first of which were spent in Sydney ; then he
came to Newcastle and settled. He commenced
business as a general storekeeper, and opened in
rather a large way, remained in business for many
years, and then retired. The gentleman was
visited at his residence a few evenings ago; and
after a lengthy and interesting chat, it came out
that Mr. Rowe had been a great sufferer for a
number of years from the liver, and also that
troublesome complaint known as the gravel. “I
have been a terrible sufferer, as many people on
this road can tell you. X had distressing pains in
my back and right side, and had awful shooting
pains in my left shoulder. My digestion got very
bad, and the pains in my chest after eating were
unbearable, and again I would have an aching
pain in my left side. I suffered this way for
years, and was getting very weak and low-
spirited. I seemed to lo e e all life and energy, and
took no interest in what was passing around me.
I consulted the best physicians in this town, but
received no permanent relief. One doctor said I
was suffering with an abscess on my liver. In
answer to further interrogations, he said that he
could produce doctors’ bills for all sorts of
amounts, and, in fact, he did produce them.
You see,” he said, “ I was given an account of a
wonderful cure effected by Gould’s Tiny Tonic
Pills, told by a Mrs. Gilbert. I was so much
struck with the story told by the lady that I de-
cided at once to give the preparation a trial, and
without any delay I purchased a bottle. Well, I
am not going to tell you that one dose or one bottle
has cured me. I shall simply tell the whole story
and my experience.
“ F irst of all, however, let me tell you that one
of the doctors here told me distinctly that I could
not get rid of my complaint. I asked him if he
thought I was going to die. He said, * Die, no,
not for 10 or 15 years yet.’ * Then,’ I replied, * I
am to expect so many years of pain any worry, am
I?’ The doctor could not reply. Then I told
another gentleman that I intended to try Gould’s
Tiny Pills, and he only laughed. All the same, I
bought the bottle, and there was undoubtedly a
marked improvement in my condition. When that
bottle was finished I purchased another. During
this time I unfortunately contracted influenza, and,
upon my word, Gould’s Pills cured that ; there’s
no mistake about it, for I took nothing else.
Messrs. Hart and Firkin, my chemists, can sub-
stantiate my statements, for they know as well as
anyone how I suffered. I tell this story for the
benefit of others who may be sufferers from similar
complaints, and I recommend Gould’s Pills as a
certain cure. There is no gainsaying the fact
that mine was an extremely bad case, for it was ;
but, as I said before, I am a different man now,
and I tell everyone what this wonderful medicine
has done for me.
“Well, I don’t think I need tell you any pi ore
about the Pills, only that there is not the least
doubt about it they are a wonderful composition.
I say positively that it was Gould’s Tiny Tonic
Pills that have cured me, and I shall never, while
I have the means, be without a bottle."

that
feeling, so prevalent in hot weather, which makes
men tired of life and work, is becoming more
common-every year. -Many attribute this to the
climate, and, in fact, the climate is responsible
only very slightly, however. If you feel
WORKT- OUT
and lack energy, you may rest assured that your
blood is thin, weak, and impure ; if it were rich
and pure it would impart vitality and energy to
every nerve and organ in the body, and the whole
system would be robust and healthy. When the
system is run down from weakness of the blood
you become
WEARY
and are only able to do a very slight amount of
work without feeling great fatigue. You have a
constant desire to lie down, and at the end of the
day feel utterly worn-out and dispirited.' You
may, by force of will, overcome that tired
FEEL-
ing for a time, but this course acts on the nerves
and results eventually in “ nervous prostration. ”
I he blood only becomes impure when the stomach
liver, and bowels are not in good working order
and the digestion is poor. The liver fails to per-
form its functions.in cleansing the blood, and the
system becomes run down. ”
GOULD’S
Tiny Tonic Pills are the best remedy for com-
plaints of this sort. They enable the stomach to
do its work quickly and thoroughly, help the
liver to help itself, and do away with constipation
and indigestion. Rich blood is the result, and
with a stream of red, pure blood flowing through
your veins you will be free from disease, and lack
of energy will be a thing of the past. For a
general toning up of the system there is nothing
like Gould’s Tiny Tonic Pills. They put things in
order so that nature can do her work, which is all
that is required.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When you’ve knocked about the country—been
away from home for years ;
When the past, by distance softened, nearly fills
your eyes with tears—
You are haunted oft, wherever or however you
may roam,
By a fancy that you ought to go and see the folks
at home.
You forget the family quarrels—little things that
used to jar—
And you think of how they’ll worry—how they
wonder where you are ;
\ou will think you served them badly, and your
own part you’ll condemn,
And you think of how you would be quite a
novelty to them,
For your voice has somewhat altered, and your
face has somewhat changed—
And your views of men and matters over wider
fields have ranged.
Then it’atime to save your money, or to watch it
(how it goes);
Then it’s time to get a “ Gladstone ” and a decent
suit of clothes ;
Then it’s time to practise daily with a hair-brush
and a comb,
Till you drop in unexpected on the folks and
friends at home.
When you’ve been at home for some time, and the
novelty’s worn off,
And old chums no longer court you, and your
friends begin to scoff ;
When “ the girls ” no longer kiss you, crying
“Jack ! how you have changed ! ”
When you’re stale to your relations, and their
manner seems estranged;
When the old domestic qnarrels, round the table
thrice a day,
Make it too much like old times—make you
wish you’d stayed away,
When, in short, you’ve spent your money in the

Naeletua and Leata.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Naeletua and Leata belonged to the John-
sonian school which preceded the invention of
conversational mincing-machines. They ranked as
papalangi, because, they had successfully annexed
rich papalangi spouses, but in reality they were
only warm-blooded, hot-tempered, large and
luscious brown Samoans, with scarce enough
civilised veneer to gloss over their semi-savage
impulses.
* * * *
They were equally lucky women, as popular
feeling reckons luck. Each had a rich trader-
husband, a fine white man’s house, fine white
man’s food, fine white man’s clothing ; each had
antecedents which unkind tongues spelt prece-
dents. But there equality ended and disparity
began. Naeletua and her lord were notoriously
weary of one another ; Leata, if she chafed at her
legal bonds, took good care to give no sign. For
Leata had been to Europe, where she adapted
herself marvellously well to the ways of civilisa-
tion, and no Frenchwoman could now teach her
anything of the art of being au mieux avec Mon-
sieur son mari.
* * * *
Leata had picked up other European arts ;
her. house and her table were quoted for their ele-
gance and excellence. And this was perhaps why
Naeletua’s Herr was so often to be found eating
salt with Leata’s John Bull. Naeletua had never
appreciated the charms of sauerkraut, potato
niideln or marzipan, and, where platonic fascina-
tion is concerned, a man’s stomach is supposed to
be as susceptible as his heart.
*'* • •
Naeletua had no more faith in Plato than
in sauerkraut; her ideas, as her. husband apolo-
getically remarked, were limited like her talents.
Her husband’s devoted attendance at Mr. Leata’s
table struck her unphilosophic brain in the light of
a personal insult —and she mentioned it. Not
being polished by travel, she mentioned it ala
Dr. Johnson.
• * • •
Leata was exceedingly shocked, nay, her
feelings were hurt; she had supposed herself
raised above such vulgar commonplace. In the
European world, the world to which she now
claimed to belong, people made their own little
domestic arrangements without comment or com-
plaint. Naeletua was acting like an uncivilised
savage, and ought to be treated accordingly.
Leata mentioned it; having to deal with a savage,
she also adopted the Johnsonian method.
* » * *
Then Naeletua did a very unwise thing :
she committed her sentiments to paper, and her
sentiments on paper were not nice reading. Naele-
tua cast unkind reflections on the Leata family
character in general ;• suggested that the father
and mother, the uncles and the cousins and the
aunts, were none of them the least bit better
than they ought to be ; and, finally, classed them
all under the unpoetic heading of Swine. Now,
Leata was said to love her people with a proud
love.
» * * *
This sort of tiling could not be coped with
in a civilised way at all. Leata laid aside
civilised ways and felt all the. old native blood boil
in her veins. She had five stalwart brothers with
sufficient muscle to vindicate the family honor ;
she set off in search of them. On the way she met
Naeletua, and proceeded, with much directness of
P u XP? se ’ , to P oun d that lady’s face; when she had
sufficiently discolored it, she observed cheerfully,
.Now I m going to send my brothers to kill you.”
• * • .
Naeletua did not wait to be killed. She
was not at all clear that her placid Herr could pro-
tect her from the five stalwarts ; neither was she
certain that if he could he would. So she fled
away to the mountains ” —or, more precisely, to
the Samoan bush, where she could safely hide in
the thick, moist jungle, and live on sundry cun-
ning little baskets of provisions brought secretly
by sympathising relatives who did not believe in
platonic sauerkraut. Meanwhile the Stalwarts
stalked around with big knives and bigger threats,
clamoring for Naeletua to come to them and be
treated like a pig.
* * • •
Apparently her absence did not seriously
affect the case, which was prejudged. High
chiefs met in solemn conclave to consider
Is aeletua s delinquencies. The gathering was a
very dignified affair ; Dogberry’s experience when
written down an ass was nothing to it.
Write us down swine ; we have been written
down swine,” cried the brothers in scorn.
“ We have been written down swine, ye stalwart
men,” said the conclave ; “ye are writ down
ignoble swine, and the writer thereby shows her
acquaintance with the ways of swine ; let her be
summoned that she be treated according to her
swinish deserts. Bid Naeletua come here to re-
ceive her due reward as a pig.”
* * * *
Naeletua did not see it at all. She knew
that the Stalwarts were powerful in the council,
and her own people but of small account. She
was very willing to call other folks pigs, but the
term when applied to herself seemed less gratify-
ing. Moreover, she knew the exact rendering of
the expression, “ being treated like a pig.” Naele-
tua stayed in the bush.
* * * *
Then came the ordeal of the pig by proxy—
which is unfair to the pig. The squealing substi-
tute was caught, dirt was stuffed into his mouth,
his fore and hind feet were tied together, and he
was slung on a pole and carried in ignominious
triumph.
“ Thus,” said the Solemn Conclave, “ shall it be
with Naeletua and her children and her children’s
children to the end of their days. We cast them
out from their own people to the swine. Naeletua
no longer bears the name of her ancestors, she no
longer takes rank among Samoans, we proclaim
her children outcasts for all time. She shall have
no claims upon her chiefs, and we wash our hands
of her and her low-born descendants.”
Having reached this happy and desirable conclu-
sion, the Conclave gave the proxy a short shrift
and feasted on its baked remains.
* * * *
What Herr Sauerkraut thought of the
proceedings has not transpired. He accepted the
position allotted to his descendants with Teutonic
calm, and discussed Samoan peculiarities with Mr.
John Bull over lager-beer.
♦ * * *
Having been publicly and formally “ writ
down a pig,” Naeletua had nothing more to fear ;
she was beneath contempt, and therefore beneath
insult. She quietly returned to her papalangi
home, and took up the thread of her life as before,
goinjj about in fine raiment and running-up house-
keeping bills with impunity. But a zest had gone
out of her life and a curl out of her passionate lip.
For when you have been writ down a pig you can
no longer hold your head so high, even if you are
m legal possession of a white trader-husband.
* • * *
But Leata, her virtue and family honor
vindicated, drives matters with a higher hand
than before, and holds supreme court as the one
fashionable papalangi wife with intelligent appre-
ciation of papalangi ways. In proof whereof
Herr Sauerkraut still frequents her table to devour
his niideln with a flavor of piquancy, and satisfied
society smiles approval. Which just shows how
very civilised Samoan society has become.
* * * •
And Naeletua, when she sits on her door-
step, as you may see her doing any evening,
reflects bitterly that it is not enough to own a
papalangi husband, a papalangi bouse, and a
papalangi purse. In order to harmonise your lot
you must speed to papalangi lands and len v n the
ways thereof. Only thus can you unravel the
mysteries of pi a tonics. Only thus can you acquire
the knack of writing down your neighbor a pig
with impunity.

ROSE DE BOHEME.
S.A. horses, used to eating hay, have, in
some cases, owing to drought, been put on chaff,
er ,m ,P ort ® d from Vic. or brought down from
the .North. Some of these animals died, and post-
mortem disclosed hard balls, apparently of coir
matting, in the intestines. The explanation
i 18 twine with which the sheaves
had been bound.was not thrown out before it was
put through the chaff-mill, and that they had
eaten it.
A prominent feature of Col. Home’s irri-
gation report to the N.S.W. Govt, is the tender
yray in which existing schemes are dealt with.
Where companies or corporations haven’t acquired
rights the Colonel damns cordially ; but where
they have—-at J:lay, Halranald, Wentworth, and
Menindie, for instance—he spares the interested
parties his denunciations. In fact, he says the
carrying out of the schemes would be valuable
from an educational point of view. Yet as to the
Menindie project (from which Broken Hill once
expected so much), it was obviously hard work to
escape saying that it was a species of lunacy.
When certain people fall out, it is alleged
that honest folk get their due. Interesting, there-
fore, to note that Rev. Rentoul, in advocating the
purchase of a new Dayspring for mission purposes
m the South Seas, instead of a subsidy to the pre-
sent shipping co., relieved himself of the following :
That eminent authority upon morals and theology, the
Argus newspaper, was opposed to the scheme. When the
Argus. supported this shipping co. for the carrying out of
the mission work, they might be quite sure that vested
interests were at the back of it.
Will Dr. Rentoul admit that similar reasons
prompt the Argus advocacy of, say, the Scripture
Education League claims ?


BLOOD PURIFIED. WEIGHT INCREASED.

“I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla with markedly beneficial results.
When I began using it 1 was very much out of health, and had lost a good
deal in weight. My blood was in an unhealthful condition, which was made
manifest in several unpleasant ways. Soon after commencing the use of
the Sarsaparilla I began to improve, my weight increased, and before very
long my health was completely restored. I heartily recommend AYER’S
SARSAPARILLA.”
The above testimonial from the gallant Colonel, and the many thousands
of others received from all parts of the world, are incontrovertible evidence
of the wonderful efficacy of AYER’S SARSAPARILLA as a blood purifier
and health restorer.
“ Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.” There are many worthless
imitations seeking to profit by the world-wide reputation of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
See that the name—Ayer’s Sarsaparilla—is on the wrapper, and blown
in the glass of each bottle. Accept no other.
