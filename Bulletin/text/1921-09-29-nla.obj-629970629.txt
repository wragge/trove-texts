The Red Page
Gray
There is probably no poem in English which
from first to last has made such a wide
appeal as the “Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard” ; and there is none more inter-
esting in construction or more curiously
related to the age in which it was produced.
Gray liked to be thought a scholar who
occasionally babbled in verse-making; but
the judgment of the years continues to place
him high up among the poets of the second
rank. By many he has been claimed as a
kind of ' morning star of the toman tic re-
vival ; by many others he is seen as the last
and most complete master of the school of
artificial poetry of which Pope .was the chief
exponent. The “Elegy” will fit either
theory; for it has all the even regularity
that a Dr. Johnson might desire in its move-
ment and choice of ideas, with something-
very fresh and attractive over and above.
The story is well-established that Gray
spent infinite time and labor in writing the
verses, that lie polished and re-polished
them stanza by stanza and word by word,
and that thus a condensation of a monumen-
tal mass of effort has produced an effect so
like genuine inspiration as to pass for the
real thing. I believe this story of the
schools needs a lot of qualification in the
light of a critical examination of the poem
itself, of the rejected portions which are
still extant and of Gray’s own character.
Gray was one of the most facile scholars of
his time—-a time which had much more
regard for quantity than for quality. Listen
to the description of him by an anonymous
writer in the London Magazine a month or
two after his death :
Perhaps he was the most, learned mail in Europe.
I-Ie was equally acquainted with the elegant and
profound parts of science. . . .He krtew every branch
of history, both natural and civil; had read all the
original historians of England, France and Italy;
and was a great antiquarian. Criticism, metaphy-
sics, morals, politics made a principal part of his
plan of study; voyages and travels of ail sorts were
his favorite amusement ; and lie had a fine taste in
painting, prints, architecture and gardening.
This says nothing at all of his classical
studies; but his letters reveal the fact that
he lived most of his time with Greek and
Latin authors, knew most of them back-
wards, and that for a long time he preferred
writing Latin verse to attempting anything
in English. He was also something of a wit,
had a curious and difficult but real sense of
humor, and spent a lot of his time-visiting
wealthy friends when he left his scholar's re-
treat at Cambridge. He is reputed to have
thought very lightly of his own work ; and tak-
ing his enormous field of reading and general
interests into account, the theory that, he
sat polishing at the, “Elegy” over a long
period of years is extremely hard to main-
tain. That he turned it over easily once
of twice at long intervals and made some
changes is a probability much more in accord
with his general character and methods.
The poem contains five sets of bad rhymes:
toil-smile, withstood-hhiod, beech-stretch,
rove-love, abodb-God. These are iu perfect
keeping with much of his other work, but
could surely have been corrected by a little
of the effort he is supposed to have ex-
pended. Originally the poem closed with
four stiffly embroidered stanzas which were
afterwards excluded; and all that follows
“Par from the madding crowd’s ignoble
strife” is an addition to the first draft. This
is the main alteration made and represents a
complete re-modelling of .the whole, not an
effort to polish. The line “Ev’n in our
ashes live their wonted fires” was an alter-
ation and distinct, weakening of “Awake and
faithful to her wonted fires”; and “On the
high brow of yonder hanging lawn” was cer-
tainly not worse than the line that now
reads “To meet the sun upon the upland
lawn.” After this line a whole stanza was
cut out with neither loss nor gain to the
complete work; and these, with a single
exception, are the alterations of Which there
is manuscript proof. The evidence of pains-
taking polishing is entirely wanting, though
the poet left nates to show' that iu four or
five other places lie was imitating classical
or Italian writers. But the most important
stanza omitted is the one which originally
directly preceded the epitaph and wms actu-
ally printed in several of the early editions.
These are the lines :
There scattered oft, the earliest of the year,
By hands unseen are sliow’rs of violets found;
The redbreast loves to build and warble there,
And little footsteps lightly print the ground.
This, in spite of one weak rhyme, tv as not
wisely removed: and certainly its absence
is to'be regretted.
The “Elegy,” the, “Ode on a Distant Pros-
pect of Eton College,” and a few lines from
“The Bard” and other poems hold their
places in the schools, in the anthologies and
in the minds of an infinite number of read-
ers; but Gray’s truest poem, a nameless
fragment, remains obscure and rarely men-
tioned. Here is a portion of it: —
Now the golden Morn aloft
Waves her dew-bespangled wing,
With vermeil cheek, and whisper soft
She wooes the tardy Spring:
Till April starts, and calls around
The sleeping fragrance from the ground,
And lightly o’er the living scene
Scatters his freshest, tenderest green.
New-born flocks, in rustic dance,
Frisking ply their feeble feet;
Forgetful of their wintry trance
The birds his presence greet:
But chief, the sky-lark warbles high
His trembling thrilling cxtacy ; [Gray’s spelling]
And, lessening from the dazzled sight,
Melts into air and liquid light.
See the Wretch, that long has tost
On the thorny bed of pain,
At length repair his vigor lost
And breathe, and walk again:
The meanest floweret of the vale,
The simplest note that swells the gale,
The coirfmon sun, the air, the skies
To him arc opening Paradise.
Gray left that unfinished and unpolished:
but his first biographer, Mason, himself a
forgottqn poet, included it among his
memoirs. It would, have made a consider-
able stir if it had appeared about 1820.
Anybody wlio wants Gray can find a lot
of him in his letters. He had a fine judg-
ment and a good sense of proportion; but his
frankness is often his outstanding charac-
teristic. His poetry is very little, of him ;
had it been the whole of him he might have
dominated the eighteenth century.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Thomas Burke
Among the younger set of English story-
tellers none lias made a bigger impression
than Thomas Burke, the author of ‘'Lime-
liouse Nights.” His art at its best is exotic
and macabre, but there is a .beauty peeping
in his most terrible tales' that scores a vic-
tory over the moral sensibilities and, in
instances, creates a thraldom that holds you
for days. I have read “Limehouse .Nights”,
three times and cannot confess to any slack-
ening of interest, even when many a charac-
ter has become familiar through some un-
earthly brutality or shameful sin. You
cannot forget those slow, slinking Chinks
living in a world of dreadful shadows and
pursuing deviously their infinite debauch-
eries. They are pictured in a prose of
insidious loveliness, though the color is some-
times too thick for the picture, and phrases
of a Huysmansish splendor blare their ex-
travagance m the wiuiig places. At his
raciest Burke is partial to the . mguage of
literary decadence. Iu spots he reveals the
twisted senses of a Dos Bssemtes in the
thrill of some frantic verbal invention.
Arthur Rimbaud, who found colors tor the
vowels, seems not unrelated to the man who
describes a music-hall that "stunk of snarl-
ing song,” and who spoils a. Limehouse noc-
turne with the forced fantasy of ‘‘stung with
sharp lamps in the distant dusks.”
Nor are all the yarns distinguished by
structural cleverness. Pansy (Been, who
stuck in her girdle a pin’ that had been
soaked for 48 hours in a "distillation of
aconite.” and therewith pricked and killed
Tai Pu when his yellow hand slithered round
her waist, is too much of a Borgia for com-
mon credibility. Moreover, the climax is
weakened by the inability of aconite to poison
a Chinaman in the circumstances. Even
if the pin had bathed in aconite’s deadlier
parent, aconitine, the possibility of a funeral
would be remote. That curtain is bizarre
and inartistic, like tin- use of the snake that
finished Battling Burrows when he tried to
rescue liis girl from the clutches of Cheng
lluan. But "The Paw” is alone sufficient
compensation for the uneasy melodrama of
the other stories. It is the sombrely-lit pic-
ture of the Greaser who, afraid to punish his
wife’s adultery' with a Chinaman, conceived
the idea of suggesting the murder of the yel-
low man to his daughter Myrtle. Therefore
he thrashes Myrtle to the devilish refrain of
"(someone oughter stick a knife—stick a knife
—stick a knife —Someone oughter stick a
knife,'' and so on, until the child learns her
lesson, stealthily invades a siesta in the
abode of Love, and, feeling a throat in the
gloom, draws a knife across it arid kills
—her mother! The deft description of
Myrtle’s awful pilgrimage keeps the reader
ill the grip of some unwholesome dread —-
a feeling that is developed elsewhere,
especially in the gruesome study of old Joe,
the gibbering paralytic who revenges the
rape of his imbecile daughter in a scene of
harrowing realism.
Whilst most of Burke’s stories throw a
piercing light on opium-sodden crimes and
feseennine amours, some are aglow with gal-
lantry and heroism, and brightened with the
laughter of children. He is particularly
the historian of little girls whose witching
faces in haloes of pale hair pass through the
reeling dramas of Limehouse and Poplar.
The type appears in the rosy ‘‘Gina of
Chinatown,” and is expanded and explained
to full book-length in the romance of
“Twinkletoes.” His portrait of this little
elf is worth repeating:
Sailing towards Chinatown was a child as lovely
and insolently happy as a lyric.' Torrents of bright
curls foamed about her shoulders, and the black silk
frock clung to her young beauty as though it loved
her. The mirror-like candor of her face, undimmed
by any breath of the world’s abominations, reflected
nothing but the serene joy of the moment. . . .Timid
as a wraith that may melt at a touch, she seemed
too fragile even for childhood ; and the mind shrank
from tlie thought that the deflowering hand of man
should rest on this phantom of a dream.
“Twinkletoes” can be devoured again and
again without losing its first fascination.
And its quality is enhanced by the vision of
a former criminal. Chuck Lightfoot. raised
to the .sudden sublimity of a Galahad by the
irresistible sweetness of the little lady.
Twinkletoes is evidently a favorite charac-
ter. She figures in verse in “London
Lamps,” a collection of poetic fancies often
delicate and imaginative and with many a
chiming, swinging line. The “Song Book
of Quong Lee” is not so attractive, because
the treatment is often as bald as the subject
matter. But there is one of Quong’s medi-
tations, “Of Politicians,” exposing Bill
Hawkins’s marriage to “a fair wife, demure
and of chaste repute,” which is delightful
enough to be developed into a full-grown tale.
Burke’s other important books, “Out and
About” and “Nights in Town,” present him
as the inquisitive explorer of London, always
approaching her with an eye of wonder, and
discovering new pleasures in her shining
streets.

Architectural Inspiration
Schlegel's picturesquely inaccurate descrip-
tion of architecture as ‘‘frozen music” has
some points of verisimilitude. There is
analogy between the long notes or phrases
of music and the long lines of arches and
towers. It is present, too, hut not so obvi-
ously, in a comparison of a bucolic song with
the rough, comfortable lights and shades of

The Violin.
Old Violin, when the dusk is deep
And the night comes down on the dreaming
sea,
You sing me low of the summer eves,
Of the scented dusks, of the drone of bees
And the winding walks through the garden
trees,
That barred the bay, with their rustling
* leaves,
From an Eden that used to be.
Dear Violin, in the nights of storm,
When the flame leaps up in the dark’ning
room,
You are home and kin and a faithful friend,
When all faiths falter, and dreams are vain,
And home can never be home again,
Will you sing to me ever, unto the end,
And lighten the deepening gloom?

Of death and wrong,
I still remember
The morning’s song
Though night falls darkly
On beach and head,
And ti-trees starkly
Their limbs outspread,
And dune and breaker
Grow weird and wan,
The lights I visioned
Burn on, and on.

The Cypress Alleys.
Dim alleys guarded by the Door of Death
Where violets grow,
Adown the swarded ways no footsteps pass
And no winds blow.
Oh, mystic are the holy drops of dew
That tremble not,
Purer than tears of joy or woe; “but here
Is woe forgot.
From bedded violets rise the cypress-trees,
So dark, so tall:
They are like carven pillars closely set
In a god’s hall.
The stately, funeral cypress is for death :
The violet
Is for a fragrant, deathless love the heart
Cannot forget.
And does no footstep break the solitude
Of this strange grove?
Betwixt the beds of love’s own violets
Cometh not Love?
Why did I doubt? Is not Love’s sweeter
name
Eternity ?
Down the dim, swarded, cypress-guarded way
You come to me.

The Answer.
1 of the dust, with the dust of truth in my
eyes,
Walking the endless way between sunrise
and night,
Shall the worm mocking me cry “I am wise,
I am wise,
I that in earth of the darkness have sought
no light”?
I that am wind and fire and kin to the star,
Soaring the deeps of God with a fearless
wing,
Shall the bird pitying cry “You have wan-
dered too far;
I and my dreaming are one in the song
that I sing”?
I of the dust that am dreams and delight and
despair,
I, the white hand of a purpose in Death’s
black glove,
Cry to my brother of darkness and my sister
of singing air
“Wise be your .journey, comrades—but ye
have not known my love!”

Nocturne.
Somewhere a violin
PFangent, and sweet, and thin,
Trembles caressingly;
Sets the strange heart of me
Wondering, wondering.
Westward the sunset glows
Amethyst, silver, rose,
Fades to a deeper hue :
Night wears her robe of blue
For the stars’ welcoming.
Venus, the first-comer.
Brings others after her,
Till with the brilliance fine
All the deep heavens shine
Like a gem-broidered dress.
Passionate, sweet and thin,
Somewhere a violin
Ends its soft melody,
Leaves the still heart of me
Filled with great quietness.

CLEANING UP THE FRONT
DOORSTEP.
News arrives by instalments of things that
the dilatory Federal authority proposes to do
with the usurpers who have so long held
possession of Darwin and made it a jest in
the face of civilisation. There is nothing
amiss with the Territory except at the Dar-
win end—nothing apart from the fact that
a great country with one mile of railway for
each 2620 square miles of land hasn’t a
show so long as there are other countries to
choose from. On the same basis England
would have 191 miles of line and N. S. Wales
about 120 miles. But about Darwin nearly
everything is wrong. The usurpers never
professed to have a tangible or permanent
form of government like a Sinn Fein or
Russian Bolshevik organisation ; but as they
didn’t even profess the slightest intention of
constructing anything, not even an outhouse,
no tangibleness was required. If they had
charge for 1000 years there is no reason to
believe that they would construct an out-
house. They were always potent to destroy
industry; in fact, they closed up, after a
very brief career, the first big industry the
Territory possessed, and deprived 2000
people of the means of support, and instead
of even suggesting anything in place of the
deceased job, they lurked around, with their
club in their hand waiting for the next one,
but no next one came. They were marvel-
lously successful at driving away population,
and ithe census shows the Territory to have
about IS per cent, fewer people than it had
20 years ago. They had a genius for de-
stroying wealth —the wealth of their own
terrorised followers. While the savings-bank
deposits of the other States increased nearly
40 per cent, between 1917 and 1920. those
of the Territory dropped almost one-half, and
became per lieac much less than half the
average of the other States. Worst of all
was the policy of victimisation and persecu-
tion —the policy natural to small bullies who
had attained to power of a sort and, not
knowing any useful purpo’se to put it to,
kept it from falling into desuetude by in-
flicting petty insults and tortures. Their
government led nowhere, and made no pre-
tence of leading anywhere unless it was to
a revolution in a desert. It held out no
hope that the most abject obedience to it
would bring any reward except perhaps a
secretary’s or organiser’s job. But it demanded
obedience none the less. It took control of
the. Darwin wharves and railway yards,
which represented such fragments of work
as remained, and it banned from employ-
ment and consigned, so far as in it lay, to
starvation men who opposed its views in
any way, or were suspected of not enthus-
ing about it, or looked sideways at it, or who
paid their taxes to the Australian Govern-
ment. Ships left with half their cargoes un-
discharged because, much of the available
labor was under a ban and ordered to starve
while the rest of the labor nroudly loafed
on its job. Vessels arriving in the harbor
were held up for "bonuses” as a matter of
course. But. as in the case of the old non-
working, lion-constructive Rhine baron of
snmll degree who lived by waylaying tra-
vellers, the highway began to be deserted.
* * * *
rile Federal authority proposes, among
othei things, to suspend the jury system.
Tins" is logical enough, for it is suspended
already insofar that the right of juries to
give any decision that the usurpers don’t
approve is quite dead. It proposes to send
away the leading usurpers to other States.
Hi ere is precedent for this, as they started
the game themselves by deporting the officers
or the Federal Government. But those of
the crowd who weren’t born in Australia
should be sent back where they belong. If
tins is not done they should at - least be dis-
qualified as voters and members, and not be
sent to other States as volcanoes in full
ei upturn. It seems a pity to export popula-
teoll from a place which has so little, but
then the whole business is a pity. The Dar-
nin Town Council is to be reformed into
a ratepayers’ body, whereas just now it is
what Lord Mayor Lambert wants the Syd-
ney Council to be- —a body created bv non-
ratepayers and spending -other people’s
money. A heavy reduction of the official-
dom with which Andrew Fisher burdened
the place will further reduce the census a
little At the same time it will reduce the
loss to Australia a good deal. The wharf
and railway goods-shed, now sub-let to pri-
vate persons who, for want of an army to
piotect themselves, have to pay incessant
blackmail to union officials, are to be
put under direct control of the Federal
authority—the same one which, by reason
or its pathetic remoteness, couldn’t prevent
its own Governor and its own Judge being
thi own out. And as a reversal of the pro-
cess the h ederal authority’s pubs are to be-
come private pubs, apparently because the
1 eii era 1 owner was too feeble to prevent the
usurpers "sticking up” drinks.
After that, the principal cause not being
removed, the old effect will spring up again.
Ihe Darwin end of the Territory is much
too far from a healthy, vigorous, well-
manned police-station. At any time since it
began the great rot could, in sane circum-
stances, have been suppressed at short notice,
xne case called for a vigorous magistrate
who would enforce the law' and who had the
necessary anti-extortion, anti-vagrancy anti-
conspiracy and anti-riot laws to enforce—
always provided he had at his disposal a
small body of police who hadn’t themselves
learned to take orders from the usurpers,
and further provided that abundant rein-
forcements of the same sort were within 60
or (0 hours’ call. They wouldn’t be wanted
it they were within call. The Darwin
leadeis never showed either courag’e, organ-
ising ability, definite programme, definite
purpose or intelligent ambition. They were
simply stupid, noisy people holding up an
isolated town and stopping business as simi-
lar people have been known to do with
an isolated wayside inn, especially if the
garrison consisted of an elderly innkeeper
and his wife. With a traiif-hveraging 28
miles an hour on the straight South-to-
JNorth line 07 hours would suffice to bring
the I ear of God from Adelaide to Darwdn
(from Brisbane to Perth the average pace
is 24 or 25 miles an hour, but the gauge
changes five times on the way). Thirty-one
hours of the South-to-North route is already
built and working. The railway distance
will be about 1878 miles wdien the work is
finished. At present the best hope of prompt
assistance when the brigandage at Darwin is
w °rse than usual is to get help from Federal
headquarters in Melbourne, 3010 miles away
by sea, 3231 miles away by land-and-sea
route, and anything up to six weeks away in
point of time.
There is no visible hope for the capital of
the misguided Territory except by putting
an end to the system which makes it the
most isolated town in Australia and further
from its own police headquarters than pro-
bably any other white man’s town on earth.
An infant city with a thousand or so of
turbulent population can’t be practically a
State by itself, maintaining sufficient police
(to say. nothing of sufficient army or navy)
to provide against any emergency, unless it
is ruled with a strong hand. Even the biggest
force it can maintain can take no chances
if the Government is to last, seeing that it
has no hope except in itself, and it must act
promptly when a deputation of more, than six
calls to see his Excellency, like the one that
called upon Gilrutii. * Of course under the
present long-distance system a spasmodic,
expensive expedition like that of Minister
Poynton’s may be sent once in two years to
make a short .stay, do repairs, and then quit
and let the old gang return, or a new similar
gang arise. In other words, the Territory
may be treated biennially as if it was a cru-
sade or a campaign or a Polar expedition.
YY ith the straight railway it could be treated
daily as if it was a suburb. A line which
will reduce the distance from one side of the
continent to the other from 3415 miles to
18(8 miles, and the time from months to
days, should show a big profit. It can’t be
judged by the East-to-West transcontinental,
for in tlint case: the old sea.route from Adel-
aide to Fremantle of 1120 miles was paral-
leled by a longer and sometimes slower land
route of 1683 miles. Anyhow, something
must be done, else Darwin, under a succes-
sion of usurpers, will dry up and blow away.
The decay of Wyndham (W.A.) and Clon-
eurry and the northern copper-field and the
Culf ports (Q.) is bad enough. But if
Darwin, a sort of deputy metropolis and the
nearest approach to a seat of government in
the two-thirds of Australia that lies north of
Brisbane, can’t be maintained, then the day is
in sight when the North will he declared by
outside Powers to be an unoccupied property
awaiting colonisation.
THE BASIS OF AUNTRALIA'S LAND
DEFENCE.
The aspects of it to which politicians,
bishops and others refer when they endorse
tlie principle of Australian land defence are
almost invariably periodical camps, drilling
and the inculcation into the trainees of a
spirit of morality and discipline. It is the
rarest thing in the world to hear anyone
associate defence with that on which the
superstructure is going to rest in the event
of invasion any time during the next century
or so. The horse, assisted bv his understudy
and biood-relation the mule, is still one of
the first, requirements for the purposes of
warfare, stationary as well as mobile. Even
in Flanders, with its network of strategic
railways and its flat, bare country ideally
suited for the emergency rails which break-
down gangs relaid as fast as they were blown
up, the men in the line would have been
starved of both food and ammunition but for
animal transport. In Australia it has been
well said that the railways in the event of
invasion are likely to be advantageous to no
one but the enemy. Whatever fighting there
is during the variously-estimated period of
from two to eight months between the appear-
ance of a hostile foreigner and the arrival of
an expeditionary force from Britain or India
to help deal with the situation, ritust be
largely of a guerilla nature. A good seat
and hands will be of more value to an Aus-
tralian in those days and in that warfare
than adroitness in rifle exercises, and a
knowledge of horse-mastership of greater
seivice than tlic most impressive word of
command. And even when overseas help
arrives (it it does) and the enemy is ousted
froin our coastal cities (assuming he is)
the final rounding-up process will be a mat-
ter of horse-transport—of men. of amrnuni-
tion. of food and guns and every other class
of supplies—first, last and all tlie time
* * -x-
When the Diggers of the mounted arms
(outside the Light Horse regiments, which
were almost exclusively composed of busli-
men) first arrived in Egypt or France or
England, one of the things that astonished
tne British officer was their indifferent horse-
manship. True, the average Australian learnt
to ride in about half the time it took the
town-bred Englishman to do it. But the
English, innocent of the fact that half the
Commonwealth’s people are huddled into
two or three cities where horses are only-
seen in delivery-vans or on race-tracks,
expected to find everybody from Australia
lamiliar with the ways and manners of the
noble animal. And to the last they envisaged
the far Southern land from which the tall
lean strangers came as peopled by horses
something like themselves —active," capable
creatures with endurance and a notable turn
ot speed The truth constitutes one of the
cnief weaknesses of our home-defence organi-
sation. During the latter part of the war,
according to a statement by Mr. E. Baynes.
of Queensland, a well-known breeder, “a
leading officer from India visited Australia
prepared to spend several millions on horses,
but owing to the lack of suitable types he
spent only half the money.” The visitor
‘‘was not foolishly particular.... he took
.fust what we would term good station
horses and the type that were plentiful a
tew .years ago, 15.2 horses with a bit of
breeding and well up to weight.” This
officer’s judgment coincided with that of the
Federal authorities almost from the beginning
of the war. They found that, in a country
which quarter of a century earlier had held
a high place as regards the production of
good class horses, it was impossible to get
an adequate supply of dnimals worth sending
overseas; and at the conclusion of the fight-
ing most of the A.I.F. remounts in Flanders
and many even 0 f those in Palestine were
foreigners. Year by year Australians are
spending more and more on that sport which
exists allegedly to improve the breed of
horse-flesh in the interests mainly of defence,
and owners continue to spend money in the
U.K. on famous blood stock. Yet with every
season that passes the general utility horse
—the animal which carries a fighting-man
or draws a limber or goes in a G.S. waggon
m war-time—becomes weedier, straighter-
shouldered, weaker-backed and more liable
to.disease. Various factors are responsible.
With the arrival of the motor-car the horse
inevitably declined in favor even in the coun-
try. Steeplechasing is a racing side-line
with us, and hot one wealthy Australian in
a thousand either hunts or rides across
country in any other capacity. The breeding
industry is in a condition of anarchy. All
sorts of wrecks are mated, ah'd their progeny,
which w-ould figure on restaurant menus in
France and be used as cats’-meat in Britain,
are allowed here to pass on their defects to
later generations. The Asiatic markets
rarely know from one season to another what
variety of “Waler” they want, and the Com-
monwealth has no one charged with the duty
of telling overseas buyers what types Aus-
tralia is ready to .supply, and seeing that such
types are available when required. We have
no national haras, such as so many other
countries which rely largely on land defence
have established—institutions which not onlv
supply sires at reasonable fees but set a
standard in breeding and management that
influences the whole trade. In brief Aus-
tralia, with every natural facility to produce
the best in the way of horse-flesh, seems well
on the road to a world-reputation for evolv-
ing the worst.
The Bulletin has repeatedly insisted on
the advisability of establishing Federal
horse-farms in the different States. This,
while'.done under the Defence power in the
Constitution and designed primarily to pro-
cure a steady supply of suitable military re-
mounts, would be none the less good busi-
ness for the civilian population. At present
many Australian outback districts are doing
something quite as stupidly uneconomic as
i.toome would do if it neglected its pearls

Australia, and when they saw what was up

e\ en then it wouldn’t work; after a few
tamt kicks, the Great Experiment fizzled
out, and the survivors shared the fragments
an n started on their individualistic own..
lhats 30 years ago. To-day there are
about a dozen of the original pioneers left
m I araguay—nine of us on New Australia
and three, I think, on Cosine; all that are
left of the 600-odd who burnt their boats and
plodded out into the wilderness. Here on
New Australia, counting heads—fair, dark
and mixed—there are about 100 all told, in-
cluding the second generation and a few
families that have drifted in from time to
time. Some who have had luck with their
cattle are fairly well-to-do. Others have a
job to keep their belts tight. Every now
and then we think we are going to make
our piles and buy one of the motor-cars that
we read about. One time we were going
to make the pile out of timber. We had a whip-
up and bought an old boiler and a lot of scrap-
iron started a sawmill. < The erector
was a Yankee who was wandering round
these parts seeking what he might devour.
With the timber we got for nothing and
native labor for next to it, our mill turned
out a success—but not for us. A little loan
was our downfall. We needed new belts
and a few gadgets to help hold the Yank’s
box of tricks together. A German firm in
our market town did the amiable, and soon
the whole concern was in that firm’s hands.
Then those I-luns made money hand-over-
fist, till about three years ago, when, having
cut up all the cheap timber, they shifted
the concern. Another carrot that dangled
before our noses for quite a time was the
railway that was going to connect up Para-
guay and Brazil. The surveyors ran the
line right through the centre of the colony.
But that scheme died an unnatural death,
and all the colony made out of the trans-
action was an unpaid booze bill that some
of the chainmen raji up with our fondista-
The affairs of the colony are managed
from Government House by an Adminstra-


dor, assisted by a committee of three—
when we remember to elect them. I.he
idminstrador’s salary is 200 dollars per
month, and as our dollar-is worth at present
three ha’pence, his screw pans out at about
Gs. a week. This is no place for politicians
shekel-hunting. The funds for salary, roads,
bridge-building and the like are raised by
a graduated cattle-tax. The owner of 2.»
branded head pays nothing; over 25 up to
40, one dollar per head ; up to 100, two dol-
lars ; and so on.
During the war we nad a bit of a boom.
Several Yankee frigorificos were started in
Paraguay, and steers suitable for bully-beef
were in great demand. A lot of our boys
and some of the girls seized the chance to
get out and see the wide world. Six of the
boys joined up; others too young for that
job. and the girls, went to the freezers to
help pack tucker for the fighters.
Our chief affliction is our “splendid isola-
tion.” We are 30 miles from the rail, and
get one mail a week, when our chasgui—
mailman —is not on the spree. When he is
we get a mail when he isn’t. We have no
school. Till about two years ago the Bishop
of the South American Mission supplied
ns with a parson and schoolmaster combined
on the fifty-fifty principle-—only our fifty
was usually about twenty. Since the war
funds have become scarce, and the Bishop
has nothing to waste on derelicts, so it was
good-bye schoolmaster. Another man we
don’t have is a doctor. Perhaps that’s why
we live so long, although some say it isn’t
long—only seems so.
We are suffering from a currency short-
age, but we manage to potter along by barter.
A couple of hens or a little pig or a bale
of tobacco to the storekeeper and take it
out in sugar and salt. Our butcher kills
once a week, on Sundays, if he is not
refereeing a cock-fight. He calls round
for a steer or a tired cow. Then we are
on the free-list for meat till we have eaten
the value of the animal. The system is very
primitive, but it works —after a fashion.
The life here is hardest on the second gen-
eration. They hear us old crocks talking
about the good times we had away back
in Australia, and they want some too. The
young ’uns get up a picnic at Christmas and
Easter, and have a dance about once a
month. The rest of the time they spend
feeding pigs and doctoring cattle. We old
’uns are fairly tame socialists now. At one
time we swore we would never work again
at a “buzzer’s” behest. We have had time
to take a second think, and when we get a
chance we hold out our hands for the wages
of serfdom and forget all the old stuff.
Old Chuff and “The Oracle” called in
last week. They had heard that I had got
a fresh demijohn, and wanted to see if
there was any truth in the rumor. “Elm,”
said Chuff, as he sampled his glass ; "how
much did you pay for this stuff?” The
Oracle said it was good enough for him.
The Oracle —he used to lecture from a.
rostrum in the Domain on Capitalism versus
Communism ; hot stuff too —says he has no
kick against Lane. “Of course, he landed
us in a bog; but that was as much our fault
as Tiis.”
“Acs, and he showed the world how not
to get socialism,” I suggested.
"No, Senor ,” said The Oracle, “the masses
will get socialism just when they have sense
enough to want it. So far they only think
they want it—what they really want is some-
thing quite different.”
And I thought again of Jack' and the
great Pig question, and half-believe The
Oracle is right.
NUEVA AUSTRALIA.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
A ROW IN The Dark.
Nothing is so hard to settle as a dispute
which the people behind the opposing cham-
pions do not themselves understand. Let
it be assumed that 90 per cent, of the
Southern-Irish have no desire, as sensible
business men, for a Republic—a change
which would be likely to bring the ruin of
foreign invasion on their country in any war
involving the use of the Atlantic. In that
case De Valera is merely following a
familiar bargaining convention in asking for
what he knows is excessive in the hope of
getting what the other side regards as exces-
sive. Though he talks of a republic he
would certainly jump at Dominion status.
Australians should know something about
Dominion status. They enjoy it themselves.
Yet when Lloyd .George recently suggested
a conference between De Valera and him-
self, based on (1) no tariffs against England
and (2) no naval defence force, almost every
paper in Australia greeted it as “a generous
offer of the same form of government as the
Commonwealth possesses.” The Protection-
ist Age, which for over 50 years has steadily
advocated the imposition of duties against
English industries, did not consider, ap-
parently, that compulsory Freetrade between
Ireland and England in any way vitiated the
principle of Dominion status where the Irish
were concerned. The now militarist S. M.
Herald— almost the only Australian paper
which supported Pearce’s attempt to apply
the Army Act to our trainees —evidently
considered the withholding of the defence
powers from the Irish to be immaterial to
full Dominion self-government. At any rate,
in issue after issue it insisted that Ireland
had “been offered the status of the rest of
the British Dominions,” and had received “a
full and frank offer of Australian autonomy.”
The ignorance, or whatever it is, as to the
constitutional position of this country is even
more marked amongst the politicians. Such
being the position in Australia, which, in
addition to constituting a world-example of
Dominion status in operation, claims the best
educational . system in the Empire, it is not
difficult to imagine the confusion existing on
the other side of the world, where illiterates
are commoner than they are here, and where
constitutional issues are rarely discussed out-
side text-books. The truth is Lloyd George
might as well give the Irish a republic out
or hand as allow them Dominion home rule,
winch not only involves full tariff and defence
p ~ w . ers ’ kyd the right to interfere in foreign
(ride Smuts on the S’African Treaty,
I.JIJ) ; independence of the Judicial Commit-
tee ot the Privy Council, “or anv Imperial
" rt Appeal at all” (vide W. M. Hughes
at the Imperial War Conference, 1918) ; and,
finally, the constitutional (though not legal)
right of secession. But there can be an effec-
tive home rule short of that. A cable of last
Friday said: —-
The National ’ Liberal Federation executive has
passed a resolution strongly supporting the offer of
Dominion status to Ireland as proposed by Mr.
Asquith in 1919.
The Asquith idea is that Ireland shall be
offered fiscal autonomy, shall not interfere
in matters of foreign policy, and shall offer
the Royal Navy the use of its ports. The
eventual settlement will probably be along
some such lines; and the desired end might
be achieved very soon indeed if the general
public on both sides of the Irish Channel
(not to mention the outlying parts of the
Empire) could only somehow be enlightened
as to what it is their representatives are
arguing about.
Freetrade in Labor.
“A report from Chicago says the Armour, Swift,
Wilson and Cudahy Packing Companies have estab-
lished the open-shop principle, and notified the
unions that only employees, anil not union officials,
will be dealt ” with in future. The companies
announce that 90 per cent, of their employees
voted in favor of the plan.”
It is a remarkable fact that, though no other
people have the social instinct so developed
as those of the U.S.A. —their clubs are num-
bered by the million, and a U.S. citizen who
belongs to less than half-a-dozen is sus-
pected of being a misanthrope—yet in no
other white country is trade unionism so
weak. The phenomenon will repay study by
the type of Australian who thinks that the
Millennium is going to appear with the estab-
lishment here of the brotherhood-of-mau
principle. In the U.S.A., when the war
began, about one citizen in 40 was a member
of a union: the figures to-day are probably
nearer one in 45. Australia has close on
650,000 unionists out of an adult working
population of 1,200,000 —say one in eight
of the total population. The weakness of
organised labor in the U.S.A. is a matter
partly of the dirt-cheap immigrant from the
south and east of Europe, and partly of the
rapidly-increasing colored brother. The
nigger no longer sticks to his Southern home.
There is a colony of 120,000 in New York,
and they swarm in the iron and steel trades
where the open-shop system has existed
since the great strike in Carnegie’s works.
They have been a factor in the Chicago
stockyards for the past decade, and the 90
per cent, vote referred to in the cable sug-
gests that they and the cheap brownish alien
have become a dominating factor. Unor-
ganised labor, with all that it implies in the
way of long and strenuous hours, or, alter-
natively, a low living standard, gets its
chance primarily by reason of the American
legal outlook. In the U.S. it is often safer
to maltreat a man than his property. The
production of goods is of more importance
than personal liberty. On the_ assumption
that unions might act in restraint of trade
and by encouraging strikes cause damage to
property, they have been injuncted in many
American States, and they are still liable to
injunction almost everywhere. “A revolt-
ing example of tyrannical capitalism !” the
Australian comrade with reverent eyes on
Russia will exclaim. Yet in the essentials
this is the present Russian industrial _ sys-
tem ; and where there is a difference it is
vastly in favor of the Yankee worker. The
Russian employer, instead of being called by
a company title, is the State, hut, like
America’s Armours and Carnegies, the
State knows nothing of color distinctions
and cares less. The American Trust at least
considers its workers to the extent of em-
ploying welfare agencies and abiding by the
workers’ votes as to certain aspects of the in-
dustry ; and the efficiency of the management
enables good wages to be paid. The Soviet
despots apparently know nothing of welfare
work and cannot afford to humor the citi-
zens who are their employees; and even
with compulsory labor and long hours they
have been unable to avert disaster on an
appalling scale. The Brotherhood of Man
system in Australia would necessarily mean
the destruction of unionism. Unionism is a
labor tariff, erected against cheap workers, and
is directly opposed to communistic principles.
Overthrow it here and we shall begin the despe-
rate; industrial struggle on which the Yankee
worker has embarked against the Japs he
would like to expel, and the niggers he never
can expel—a struggle in which not only
cheap Russians and Dagoes but every vari-
ety of Asiatic coolie would compete. It
would be not so much the Millennium as a
dog-fight.
Khaki in the Streets.
Sydney has been infested with street bands
since the war; they are increasing, and
every one of them is ostensibly a soldiers
band. The method of collection adopted by
most of them is to throw out an impenetrable
cordon of disabled men who importune
passers-by. Nothing quite like it is to be
witnessed in other white British communi-
ties, or, indeed, anywhere outside Asia or
the poorer regions of Southern. Europe.
The spectacle is regarded with humiliation
by the members of 1 practically every class
but one, that one being the pacifists, inter-
nationalists and others who want to bring
the uniform of the soldier into discredit. In
Perth the Returned Soldiers’ Assoc, knocked
the system of thinly veiled mendicancy on
the head from the beginning. The Assoc,
said, in effect, that it would make the busi-
ness of getting jobs for limbless ex-Diggers
a first charge on its energies, but that under
no circumstances would former members of
the A.I.F. allow the uniform to be exploited
for what is virtually public begging. There
was, of course, nothing new about the prin-
ciple thus laid down ; it has been a punish-
able offence in the United Kingdom for
generations to bring the King’s uniform or
a semblance of it into contempt. And while
that was sound national policy in the past,
it is sounder and more urgent to-day when
there is so active a section ready to point
the finger at a mutilated soldier rattling
a box in the street, and to make the insidi-
ous suggestion that that is what the nation
forces its broken soldiers to do. The time
may come when Australia will have to fight
for' its very life ; and every khakied figure
in the street soliciting alms to-day will make
it then more difficult either to introduce
universal service or to do effective recruit-
ing. Meantime he makes the fight in favor
of national military training for Australian
defence harder —and it was hard enough
already. So we are putting into the mouths
of the enemies in our midst a gibe that may
steal our country away. And by tolerating
the practice we are also putting shame upon
the A.1.F., the most upstanding, indepen-
dent body of free men that ever went to a
war, and shame upon Australia, which can
well afford to relieve its amputation cases
of the necessity of earning a living in such
a manner. And, of course, shame upon the
city whose authorities are so willing—per-
haps even anxious—to discredit the khaki
that they allow this sore to spread.
“To Take and Hold.”
Recent events suggest that the union sec-
retaries, organisers and Labor editors who
resolved in Melbourne last June that the
Australian unions and Labor Leagues should
be converted into “one class-conscious econo-
mic organisation”—under which there would
be some first-class billets for union secre-
taries, organisers and Labor editors—“to
take and hold the means of production by
revolutionary industrial and political
action,” are not going to have it all their
own way. Labor conferences in some of
the States have been passing judgment on
the Melbourne programme, which is to be
finally considered at Brisbane next month.
Tasmania approved of it and thereby en-
sured the defeat of the Speck Labor party
at the next elections, if by that time —so
bitter a struggle has begun between the ex-
tremists and the moderates —there should be
any Speck Labor party left. Victoria was
also favorable on the whole, but expressed
a lingering prejudice in favor of the White
Australia policy and “the cultivation of an
enlightened and self-reliant community.”
These articles of the old faith don’t appear
in the new doctrine, as formulated in June.
Self-reliance is a thing abhorrent to the
modern Marxian variety of Labor leader,
who regards the Australian —in essentials
the most resolute individualist on earth—as
a creature so poor and weak-kneed that the
State requires to do everything for him.
from the cradle to the grave; and arnomr
those who drew up the Melbourne proposals
were raving internationalists like Walsh
(imp.), who said that if 2000 Chinese wanted
to join the Seamen’s Union he would admit
them all. i’erhaps for that reason White
Australia wasn’t mentioned. It is hard to
reconcile self-reliance with the “socialisa-
tion” of everything, and the maintenance of
racial purity with the institution of brud-
derly love in international relations and the
scrapping of the national defences —policies
enthusiastically championed by the aforesaid
secretaries, organisers and editors —but
great things are expected of the Brisbane
congress. South Australia also accepted the
new creed with reservations. But its reser-
vations are important as Victoria’s and even
more politically significant. When the Mel-
bourne “preamble” was read out at Adelaide
the S. Aus. politicians pounced on the words
“to take and hold the means of production
by revolutionary industrial and political
action. “Imagine what would happen to
us,” they sarcastically observed, “if we
preached revolution in a State like South
Australia,” and they turned down revolu-
tion with a thud. The trouble is that the
voting power of the S. Aus. delegates in the
councils of the party is relatively small. At
the moment it looks likely that the Brisbane
proceedings will be dominated by extremists
from the three big States, reinforced by the
majority of the Tasmanian representatives.
If this is the case (and the A.W.U. press
exultantly predicts it) strife at home and
pacifism abroad —a war of extermination on
every Australian who pays wages and peace-
by-backdown with a militant Asia —will be-
come the policy of the Labor party, and the
South Australians will have to accept it, and
be destroyed by it, or secede. The same
alternative will confront the Westralians
(who are so anti-extremist that they have
removed the ban on conscriptionists and
attend functions in honor of Hughes), the
moderates led by Catts in N. S. Wales and
considerable minorities in other States —in
a word, “the conservative elements of our
party” condemned by the Worker. On the
face of it the task of forcing these “con-
servative elements” to accept a programme
of revolution and wrongs-of-Ireland will be
rather formidable. Still, wonderful things
are expected of the Brisbane congress.
A Last Straw in Queensland.
Queensland waits in fear and trembling to
learn if its railways will have to be buried
altogether. For another bad item of news
has struck it. In 1919 the good rates
were high enough in all conscience. The
charge for dragging a ton of the highest-
priced freight 5U miles in Queensland was
£2 Is. 2d., and for a ton of the lowest-priced
4s. 10d., while Victoria's rates were £1 bs. 9d.
and bs. respectively. But even with these
enormous exactions the Queensland railway
systems paid only 15s. sd. per £lOO on their
cost, while that of Victoria paid £3 15s.
There were too many thousand superfluous
employees, appointed in return for votes;
and just because they were so numerous they
grew to be a political power which dictated
to the Ministry, raised their own wages in the
most casual fashion, and practically took
control of the lines out of the hands of the
Commissioners —in the North, at all events.
In such absurdly large States as Queens-
land and AVestralia, and in a province so
absurdly far away from its rulers as the
Northern Territory, the arm of the law is
weak in the outlying parts, just as it used
to be on the fringes of Rome or China.
Places like Cloncurry, 1059 miles from its
seat of government, or Darwin, 3010 miles
from the power that is supposed to rock
its official cradle, live in a state of chronic
insurrection, provided some brisk kind of
Carranza or Huerta happens along to set
up his Provisional Government and curse at
large. So the railways—the Northern rail-
ways especially—became a mass of incivility,
inefficiency, untidiness and unprofitableness.
With three men doing One man’s work, and
doing it poorly, too many men were with-
drawn from productive employment, and with
all this incubus and octopus to pay for, taxes
as well as railway charges had to be
enormous. The only reward the Queens-
lander got for paying 445. 2d. freight where
the Victorian paid 235. 9d. was that he had
also to pay 975. Gd. per year in State taxa-
tion while the Victorian paid 41s. The
crazed Cabinet at Brisbane proceeded to put
up its charges even higher, that being the
only thing it could think of. It succeeded
in shoving up the railway earnings to
£1 11s. lOd. per cent, on the loan capital
invested in the business. In Victoria,
which is an area of manageable size, and
where the Government doesn’t Bolshevik, or.
froth at the mouth, or devote itself to the
reconstruction of society, the railway return
stood steadily the same year at £3 14s. sd.
per cent. But the partial revival in the
takings of Theodore’s lines died a natural
death. The extra rates reduced business.
The spread of Bolshevik teaching in the
North, where the Government had joyously
planted the seed in its Opposition days,
closed up mines, and that also reduced busi-
ness. The chronic insurrection in the North
became more chronic, and the disorder and
disrepair grew worse. Trains were cancelled
.wholesale. Mail trains became mixed trains.
More and more railway employees, whom
the bedevilled Cabinet dared not sack, hung
about stations with little or nothing to do,
drawing their pay and filling in time with
spitting exercise. The return on the capital
invested dropped for the year to June 30,
1921, as low as 10s. 7id. per cent., which
meant that there was £1,512,000 interest to
pay on railway debt alone, and only £231,000
to pay with. This was £406,000 worse than
the previous year, and it looked as if State
taxes would have to be raised to £5 10s. per
head per annum unless the Theodore Min-
istry preferred to drown itself in the Bris-
bane River. Queensland had an idea that
things couldn’t become worse than this, but
they did—immediately. Two months of the
new financial yeai; ended on August 31, and
the railway results were £127,000 worse
than for the corresponding period last year
(income was £BB,OOO less, and expenses
£39,000 more). If these figures can’t be
improved the result for the whole year will
be £762,000 worse than last year’s. There
are none of the orthodox reasons to account
for all this disaster—invasion, flood, drought,
pestilence, ordinary financial crisis, nor even
any abnormal fall'in prices (prices of every-
thing of importance that Queensland pro-
duces are higher than in 1914, and in 1914,
under a different sort of Government, the
State seemed rich and happy). It is simply
that prosperity flees from Theodore,
Fitielly and co. as a mad dog flees from
water.
Will It?
N. S. Wales Opposition-leader George
Fuller gave a list the other day of things
his party proposes to do, and things it pro-
poses to undo when it gets into office. It
was a fairly satisfactory list, but
(1) Will it say exactly what is its view about
cutting up N. S. Wales into three or four manage-
able States?
(2) Will it, supposing the answer to No. 1 is
“No,” put the usual guff about “decentralisation’’
into dates, figures and details? How many of the
unused and inaccessible ports will it connect with
their hinterland by the few short lines of railway
required, and will it equip these ports for trade
and give them every chance that Sydney had? Also
when ?
(3) Will it enact that every woman shall be auto-
matically and without charge a full member of her
husband’s union, with a vote on strike matters especi-
ally—the matters which are liable to deprive her and
her children of food, clothes, bedding, fuel and fur-
niture ?
(4) Will it clean up the manners of Parliament
by abolishing privilege as between members? Will
it, for example, provide that when one member calls
another a thief the orator may be proceeded against
civilly for damages?
(5) Will it have only one electoral roll —the
Federal one?
(6) Will it establish a sinking fund, even if it is
a small one, and fence it round ?
(7) Will it declare the non-payable, non-interest-
bearing bonds which Sydney municipal servants are
influenced or terrorised into buying so that Labor
aldermen may have funds to secure a fresh lease
pf their apparently valuable billets to be good
bonds repayable on demand by the persons who
printed, signed or issued them? And will it enact
that any attempt at such issues in future shall be
considered extortion by threat?
(8) Will it disqualify all pre-selected candidates,
seeing that the preferential voting system abolishes
the risk of any party losing a seat by the splitting
of the vote, and pre-selection is now only a method

nection between 2,000,000 bricks at Canberra and
their unemployed members.” —Daily paper.
You that are unemployed, consider well
The bricks of Babylon
Piled up in heaps exactly where they fell
With all the mortar gone.
Ask for the job of putting in repair
Each residential flat,
’And that six miles of palace frontage where
Nebuchadnezzar sat.
The site is ample for a splendid town.
The whole wide desert show
Would hardly 'bring at auction half-a-crown
From there to Jericho.
Delightful suburbs might be made to spread
To north and south and west;
With asphalt from the sea that now is Dead
The streets could all be drest.
There would be work enough for every man
At every kind of trade ;
And none need hurry, once the job began,
Nor feel the least afraid
That it would not be done to contract time,
Nor that when quite complete
There would be any lack of bricks and lime
To add another street.
For when the city filled the shining east
From desert plain to plain.
It would not matter in the very least
If it fell down again.
The various phantoms of our varied dream
Move lightly and pass on.
But think of this: it is a solid scheme—
This building Babylon !

alternative, will it put the business and lion-resi-

Another “Chain” for the Workers.
The lament of an old Labor editor:—
The A.L.P. proposal to collect a 10- or 20-shilling
kvy for the purpose of setting- up “a chain
of Labor papers” throughout the Commonwealth,
is not likely to arouse much enthusiasm among
Labor unionists, least of all among those who live
in any of the three capitals and one outside town
where the Labor daily is a more or less welcome
guest at every good unionist’s breakfast table.
Labor daily papers have proved such an expensive
luxury that it is easy to find hundreds of Laborites
in Brisbane, Adelaide, Broken Hill and Hobart who
rather wish they had listened to the few older pro-
phets who, amid the noisy enthusiasm of a decade
or so ago, persisted in declaring that the game
was not worth the candle.
Quite apart from the weighty and more or less
inevitable handicap of managerial and literary ama-
teurism which new Labor dailies have to carry, there
is the transparent fact that advertisers do not value
a Labor daily’s space at the same rate per inch as
that of the ordinary daily of similar size and cir-
culation. Political and social prejudices have some-
thing to do with this; but the larger influence lies
in the fact that the bulk of the Labor daily’s readers
are of the wage-earning class and uninterested in
advertisements dealing with the more costly kind
of goods. Among the million well-advertised com-
modities in which the average wage-earner has no
interest are fertilisers, machinery, stock sales, land
sales, shipping, banking, mining, pianos, motor-ears,
traction-engines, diamond tiaras, Brussels carpets,
Persian cats, Pomeranian pups, building material
and silk hats. Though some of these items may
occasionally figure in the advt.-eolumns of a weekly
Labor paper, nobody outside a. lunatic-asylum or den
of blackmailers ever expects to see them adorning
the revenue-earning space in a Labor daily, if there
is another sort of daily paper circulating in the
same locality. Advertisers want results, and to get
them must place their advts. where they will catch
the eye of the larg-est number of the right people.
Advertisements about tea, pills, sausages, picture-
shows, boots, betting odds and the like are of equal
interest to miners and millionaires, farmers and
factory-hands, and are of course found in all sorts of
papers. But for the most part they are not well-
advertised lines. The ad.-value of circulation ’de-
pends wholly on accuracy of aim, and in regard to
at least one-third of the total newspaper advertising-
in Australia to-day, Labor dailies cannot hope to
score. Against this disqualification there is of
course the monopoly for Labor dailies of the half-
inch advts. of union meetings, etc., but as a source
of revenue this does not amount to anything worth
while.
The alternative to successful business covnpeti-
tition is a subsidy: Labor supporters must pay an
annual or perhaps weekly levy, plus their ordinary
subscription. Apart from the leading article, which
is seldom read, except by those who like to see
their own supposed opinions expressed in print by
a perfectly well-known £l2-a-week “comrade” posing
as “we,” there is no difference in the reading matter.
In quantity and accuracy of news and literary and
typographical attractiveness the advantage is gener-
ally, often overwhelmingly, with the non-Labor
sheet. To the unionist subscriber, who, like other
people, wants his money’s worth in what he buys,
the levy may seem a good deal to pay for an
allegedly propagandist leading article which he
doesn’t need and probably doesn’t read. So he goes
slow on his levy or his subscription, and has to be
periodically reminded, by various more or less
expensive methods, that it is his bounden duty as
a loj-al class-conscious unionist to make some finan-
cial sacrifice in order to prevent the Labor daily
falling into the hands of unscrupulous financiers
or a band of capitalistic brigands who are lying in
wait to seize the caravan and cut Labor's throat
behind its back, thus leaving it without a voice
to call its own or to save it from the horrors of
shipwreck. There is always “a band of unscru-
pulous and wealthy profiteers” scheming to obtain
control of the Labor daily.
Perhaps it is for these reasons that in the three
States where Labor dailies have been published for
periods varying between six and 12 years there are
fewer Labor Leagues and fewer Labor members of
Parliament than there were seven years ago. Cer-
tainly many of the staunchest unionists regard
weekly Labor papers as more effective propagandists
than dailies.

An Incurable City anti a Moral.
It was mentioned recently that the destruc-
tion by fire of the ancient city of Astrakhan
was mooted, not that there was anything
intrinsically wrong with the place, but
because of the bugs that had got into it.
Being old, semi-European and semi-Asiatic,
it was always dirty, but the tilth had
become so extraordinary that it wasn’t safe
to leave it alone when the famine and
cholera came, yet to stir it up with clean-
ing processes might start a record epidemic.
George Fuller’s announcement that, when
his party returns to power in X. S. Wales,
there will be a strenuous wiping out or burn-
ing down of existing political structures is
in much the same category. Those struc-
tures may have been good enough to begin
with, but because of the bugs that got into
them, they have become incurably uninhabit-
able. So it may be best to get rid of
them and the shame and discredit attached
—to clear the ground before building, as a
common phrase goes. Thus the idea of a legal
minimum wage was good to commence with;
hut it has developed into a basic wage which
shuts out more and more men and youths
from all employment and all wages because
the selling value of, the things they produce
is far less than the legal price to be paid for
producing them. To pay less or to accept
less is made a crime, but to go loafing, beg-
ging, “demonstrating,” mildly rioting and
destroying industry isn’t. Again, the whole
Arbitration system was created for the pre-
vention of strikes and to avoid disastrous
stoppages of production. “Arbitration” is a
high-sounding, long-sounding word, but it has
THE WALLFLOWER.
“The N.S.W. Chief Secretary (Mr. Dooley) distinguished himself at Lithgow, astonishing the resi-
dents by his display of the terpsichorean art. He fox-trotted, waltzed and jazzed with the best of
them and as indefatigably as anyone.”
no more value than “Configuration” or “Con-
glomeration” if the decisions of the Court
are despised, and strikes are more numerous
and longer drawn-out and more bitter than
ever before. A while ago the N. S. Wales
price-fixing Court was on trial with just the
chance of being a useful institution, but it
hadn’t been going a month before it had dis-
credited itself in a hopeless fashion. As for
the anti-profiteering scheme it was dis-
credited from the start, the men who de-
vised it being themselves the most glaring
salary-profiteers in the State’s history. In
addition to this they made hardly a decent
pretence of public sentiment in the matter,
and gave the impression of gloating over the
invention of a weapon that could be used
to ruin the employing class even if it didn’t
help the employee class. Altogether there
has grown up such an enormous and useless
and more-or-less corrupt accumulation of
offices and hired busybodies and purposeless
interferences and arrogant hindrances that a
drastic clearing away is needed to avert the
bankruptcy of the Treasury and to avert
also the paralysis of industry through too
many people sitting on Benches when they
should be making boots. The application' of
the method proposed for the city which lias
developed too many bugs seems to lie the
only way out.
On the Brink of the Precipice of
Victory.
“Sol. M ala phoc" begins to wonder
I wonder whether if I were a Sinn Fein leader I
would rather get nothing from Lloyd Georoe, finding-
on arrival at the precipice of success that it looks
cold and dismal at the bottom, where victory lies.
Either independence or Dominion status would pro-
duce a change which might be a. drop from the sub-
lime to the absurdly ordinary—from the position of
Garibaldi or Joan of Arc to that of an alderman.
Whether I became the first Washington of the Ke-
public or the first John Storey of a much smaller
Dominion than John’s I would be in a new atmo-
sphere with a new set of duties. There would be no
more scope for fiery eloquence directed against the
alien ruler and no more demand for men of Peter
the Hermit’s class to keep the torch alight. Instead
there would be a call for plodding financiers, organ-
isers, administrators, boss road-menders and the like.
This is a class which the island has hardly developed
yet. And if I wasn’t of that class I would have to
make way, sooner or later, for somebody of the
town-clerk or house-builder type who was. There
would be less foreign policy to conduct than Switzer-
land or Portugal has, for these States possess land-
frontiers and old military and diplomatic traditions.
Also Portugal has colonies (800,000 square miles of
them), while Ireland, being born too late, would hare
none. So it wouldn’t need a colonial policy either.
There would be little space even for a naval and mili-
tary policy, for the new League of Nations is against
new war adventures. In fact, the departments in
which men of romance and adventure like myself and
Disraeli and Palmerston are accustomed to blaze
would be very small affairs indeed.
A glowing foreign atmosphere would freeze when
freedom was achieved, for no one runs for any great
length of time or with any enthusiasm after a ’bus
when the ’bus is caught. The Italian cosmopolitan
patriot found it freeze when Mazzixi’s work was done
and United Italy arrived. The Greek who was hailed
as a Pericles and a Leonidas in the last days of the
oppression when Byron wrote poems about him and
died for him (the Greek was really oppressed) be-
came just a retail fish-vendor when better times came.
To exchange such a wide rich atmosphere of sympathy
and romance for such a very small island, and at
the same time to close all the vast official depart-
ments of the Empire against ambitious young Irish-
men, looks a big sacrifice when viewed closely.
It will certainly involve a considerable read-
justment of mental perspective. The foreign
subscriptions will cease and there will be a
very large number of people (many of them rather
unpractical people whom it will be difficult to fit in)
with claims on the new republic because of past ser-
vices and sufferings.
With the establishment of any form of independence
an old bond which Holds the people together—the
bond of common grievance—will vanish. A republic
might break into separate States as the old Ireland
did. It migh% follow the example of Central America
which dissolved into five (now six) entities, the tie
of blood only holding for 17 years after the Spanish
rulers were disposed of. There are plenty of similar
examples. And Ireland as a self-governing Dominion
might develop the common tendency to break into
smaller Dominions. To unite is one thing. To keep
united is another.
In short, success would mean putting the theory
of Irish unity to the test after a notable binding in-
fluence was gone, and if it failed after a few years
to stand the test there would be a sea of trouble and
an immensity of ridicule for the men in charge. It
also means in the immediate present that the standard-
bearer's glittering position is abolished and there is
instead of it, at the best, a prosaic job of keeping
small housewifely accounts and looking after small
housewifely repairs for which standard-bearers often
prove quite unfit.
4 —.
An Australian commercial firm, wanting to
know —as a matter of business, apparently
—what the house it was dealing with in the
U.S.A. thought of the effects of prohibition,
asked for a report, and furnished a Bulle-
tin article as a text. It got this reply:—
In attempting to prove that prohibition is a fail-
ure Mr. Dexter makes two fundamental mistakes.
In the first place he gives personal observations made
in New York city, which is only a very small part
of the United States, and in which successful pro-
hibition has not been developed to the extent
reached in other parts of the nation. It is not fair
to ascribe the dampness of one small and backward
section of the nation to the entire nation as Mr.
Dexter does. In the second place Mr. Dexter
compares prohibition in New York with per-
fection instead of with conditions existing before
the adoption of the prohibition law.
A complete answer to the inference that prohibition
is a failure in America because it is not yet success-
ful in a few sections of New York City is found in
the results of prohibition throughout the nation.
Police reports and other public records show that
crime, drunkenness, sickness and poverty have greatly
decreased under prohibition practically everywhere
in America. A great mass of statistics could be
presented in support of this assertion. The fact
that the Congress elected last fall after prohibition
had been in operation for some time shows an
increase in the number of drys proves that the
people in general ‘ consider prohibition a success.
In New York City itself prohibition has brought
about a great change for the better. As suggested
above, prohibition cannot be fairly judged by the
remaining violators but by the decrease in the sale
of liquor and the consequent harm therefrom. The
public records show that intoxication and crime
have decreased in New York City to an amazing
extent considering how strongly the liquor forces
were intrenched in this city.
In common with predictions made by pro-liquor
writers in America Mr. Dexter’s prophecies rela-
tive to the Volstead Act, our National Prohibition
Enforcement Law, have already been disproven by
events. The new Congress will make amendments,
but these will be designed to make prohibition even
more effective. There is no possibility of the law-
being so amended as to permit an increase in the
legal alcoholic content of beverages.
But. that still doesn’t affect the right of
Jones to tell Smith what his habits shall
be so long as those habits are not offensive.
If Jones has a right to tell Smith that he
shall not have a single drink, he has a right
to tell him that he shall not smoke, or wear
jewellery or do a thousand other things. A
nation can pay too big a price even tor its
sobriety.
A few weeks ago a man and his wife
appeared before the Brisbane Police Court
charged with obtaining rations while in re-
ceipt of wages from employment. It was
shown that this thrifty couple had earned.
£6 9s. 6d. during one week when they were
being supplied with the Government chanty.
Later another Brisbane citizen was charged
with having obtained nearly £9 worth ot
foodstuffs from the State on the ground that
he, his wife and children were destitute.
Inquiries elicited that he owned a house,
had £(5O in the hank and had just spent £3O
in repairs. Further allegations were made
to the effect that he owned a farm at Rose-
wood ; Yiut he denied this. The possession
of house and bank balance he admitted, but
he urged that other men had told him that,
despite his possessions, he should have been
getting State rations long ago. These in-
stances —two out of many—afford evidence
of the demoralisation of a once self-respect-
ing population for which ear-tickling, popu-
larity-hunting, vote-catching politicians are
wholly responsible. A couple of years ago
an M.L.A. told his unemployed constituents
that it was the duty of men out of work to
pocket their pride and make no bones about
taking relief. "If,” he continued, “you have
money in the bank, do not draw upon it and
exhaust it, but save it and go for the
rations.” What wonder that Bananaland,
once the most self-respecting and indepen-
dent of States, is now so largely content to
chuck its job and loaf on the community .
All Australia is paying for the loss of self-
respect in its politicians; but the Queens-
land bill threatens to be the biggest.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
From the Federal Gallery :
Though Willie Watt says he has no animus against
Hughes, he still wants the old party boundaries
restored; which presumably means that he would
have Nationalists split up once more into Liberals
ar.d laborites and produce a situation that would
bring the hon. member for Balaclava a little nearer
the Treasury benches. But Watt’s disinterested
aspiration is in little danger of being realised. With
all his faults, Hughes is a great party engineer, and he
has managed to weld two sections, originally only
united by their demand for conscription, into a solid
and fairly peaceable whole. No doubt there has been
acute bickering, and there are a few —Fowler, for
instance —who would willingly change Hughes for
Watt; but the queer thraldom that the little fellow
wields over men would make him safe from any
challenge within the party. Hughes has strong
support even in the Liberal wing of his crowd; in
fact,, more than Watt could command if it were
put to the test.
There has been more trouble in the State
coal-mine at Baralaba (Q.). When the last
strike occurred Jones, the Labor Minister
of Mines, stated bitterly (1) that the Bara-
laborers were getting 245. 6d. a day for little
more than half the work done in a neighbor-
ing privately-owned pit, (2) that they had
practically ceased to hew coal after the mid-
day meal,' and (3) that the State was losing
2s. 9d. on every ton turned out. Matters
were fixed up somehow, and the weary Titans
returned to toil; but recently they came out
because the manager didn’t sack a unionist
who had “defied the executive.” And when
the offender was dismissed, in obedience to
the executive, they were called out , a g air J
because the manager put on a man without
reference to the same almighty lot, although
he was married, a local resident, a member of
the union and out of work. Whereupon the
anguished Jones closed down the mine and
paid off all hands once more. It’s a glowing
ad. for “socialisation,” the new Labor short-
cut to the Millennium. Under “socialisation
those who fail to keep sweet with the execu-
tive, by payment of blackmail or otherwise,
will have a perfectly gorgeous time.
It was modestly admitted last week,
amidst the dull roar of recrimination in
MacqUarie-street, that Ma State’s imports
in 3920-21 exceeded the exports by
£20,752,353. Also that, although the Storey
Government has spent £2,294.700 of 0 per
cent, money in advances to distressed settlers
and purchase of fodder, and is preparing to
write off “hundreds of thousands ’ m re-
spect of fodder and seed, the area under
wheat is little more than it was a year
ago. However, Ma is growing magnificent
crops of royal commissions. In 1920-21 they
sprouted at the rate of one every four weeks,
and increased the deficit bv £33.183. South
Aus. contrives to run two Houses of Parlia-
ment and a Governor for £31,800 p.a.
The end of a dangerous agitation: —
Like Atlee Hunt, who dealt with the application
of the public-service employees, Justice Powers, of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court, has declined to fix
a basic wage of £5 16s. 6d. a week for the continent.
His Honor is satisfied, not only that Australian in-
dustries can’t afford to pay the increase demanded,
but that they are in such a condition that “the pre-
sent basic wage must be lowered, if and when prices
fall, in the same way and for the same reason as
it was increased from time to time since 1907.
And he says some plain-spoken things about the im-
becility of those who maintain that the Australian
wage-earner is on the breadline when £25,000,000
is spent in liquor and millions in gambling every
year, and who demand a rise of £1 10s. a week for
438,735 young unmarried men and 167,791 child-
less married men, while thousands of their fellow-
unionists are out of work. It was a glaringly dis-
honest demand, anyhow—dishonest because the re-
port of the Piddington Commission, on which it
was based, was unscrupulously misrepresented. The
Piddington Commission is alleged to have recom-
Hiehded the payment to all workers of a £5 16s. 6d.
mitiitnutn. It not only did nothing of the sort, but
Piddington, K.C., the chairman, said that anything
of the sort would be shamefully inequitable, and
Knibbs went further and said it was impossible.
From the Vic. Gallery:—
The Lawson Ministry is over its recent trouble,
but it will have to be reconstructed if it is to hold
on. Lawson, Peacock, McPherson and Robinson are
regarded as the indispensables, although some of
the Liberals think Robinson too conservative. McWhae
is going to London as Agent-General, and there is
a vacancy for an honorary Minister. The order in
which the Ministerial party would be prepared to
dispense with the balance of the Cabinet is (1)
Baird, (2) Clarke, (3) Oman, (4) Angus, (5) Pen-
nington and (6) Barnes. McPherson is not a per-
sonal favorite, but his financial ability is respected,
and the House is in no hurry to see the last of him.
From one of Joseph Carruthers’s appeals
to this nation to borrow another £300,000,000
to put a million farmers on to a million
farms:—■
Don’t under-rate our interior. It is as good as
Texas and other States of America.
This paper hopes it doesn’t under-rate our
stomach, and is willing to lie a little about
our native bowels so long as it is merely a
matter of national pride. But if it is pro-
posed to use our alleged brilliant innards
as an excuse for raising more money and
having a good time with it and leaving the
baby to pay, then louseph and The Bul-
letin have to tear themselves apart. Com-
paring Texas with Carruthers’s State (and
though it is the biggest of Uncle Sam’s
States, it is the only one which approaches
N.S.W. for size), the main point is that in
1919 the public debt of Texas was £SOO,OOO
while N.S.W.’s debt, quite apart from its
railways, is £80,000,000. And Texas has
managed to scrape together almost exactly
twice N.S.W.’s population. Which suggests
that keeping out of pawn is the way to
promote settlement, and that the Carruthers
scheme had better be put in the fire.
Mr. Beeby, N. S. Wales’s work-reducing
Judge, apparently lacks the reverse action.
He suggests the machine in which a pig goes
in at one end and mince comes out at the
other, but all the afterthought in the world
won’t make the mince go back and come out
pig again. Lately Mr. Beeby knocked four
hours off the working week _at the Ultimo
(Sydney) pipe-foundry, which afterwards
closed; but he declares that even if he were
filled to the brim with goodwill he cant
knock these hours on again. The precipice
which he manages is for one-way traffic
only. The average working hours of a num-
ber of the men were really 411. On the
face 'of things the reduction of the maximum
time from 48 to 44 hours didn’t affect them ,
but as a sacred point of loafing honor they pro-
ceeded to do one-twelfth less work. Indeed,
DIRECT ACTION—BUT NOT TOO
DIRECT WHERE THE “BOSE” IS
CONCERNED.
UNIONIST : “Is this the ballot to decide to
call the strike off?”
UNION Boss: “Well, no! This is the ballot
to decide whether we’ll have a ballot
to decide what steps we shall take to
call the strike off.”
such was their anxiety to give good measure
of slowness, they did about one-sixth less.
It is a very rare manufacturing business in
which that proportion of the gross value of
the output is profit, so the pipe industry took
the knock. In these circumstances it is no
wonder N. S. Wales Statistician Smith
should report that for every thousand pounds
or tons or yards or gallons of production in
the Ma State in 1911 there are now only 685.
Even the cockatoo in N. S. Wales Minister
Dooley’s front garden now tells the passer-
by that there are 4000 less unemployed than
when the Ministry took office. Last week
Dooley made the statement twice, having a
profound faith in plodding reiteration. Yet
he can’t blot out that unpleasant page 01
in Knibbs’s Quarterly Summary, which says
that from January to June, 1920 (Dooley
and co. took office in April, 1920) the unem-
AT THE ZOO.
“But he looks real, don’t he, mother?”
“Well, he ain’t real, and you’ll come away
from him. He’s only a horrible dream
— that’s what he is.”
ployed were, as a steady thing, 55 per 1000
unionists, and this year they went up gaily
to 137 per 1000. Stm-ey’s combine can t
help going down to history as the Stupid
Ministry, but it needn’t be so dashed mono-
tonous. Dogberry and Bumble were stupid,
but they had variations.
Thus Justice Powers, of the Common-
wealth Arbitration Court: —
Our large industries are seriously challenged by
importations from other countries of goods made
under conditions of mass production, piece work,
longer working hours, and at greatly reduced rates
of wages compared with those existing in those
countries in 1920. Nearly every day reports of
further reductions in wages in England, the United
States and in all civilised countries are being re-
ceived. Some industries have been unable to keep
going. There are thousands of unemployed at pre-
sent. What chance would they have if 40 per cent,
or any additional sum is added to the wage?
And the superstition of the moment that the
less work men do the more employment
there will be is referred to in these terms:
The countries in which the workers produce the
most —that is, do the fairest day’s work —are those
in which the workers get the best wages. Men who
believe that less work by each employee must neces-
sarily mean more employment are wrong. Every
worker must do as good work as workers do in
other civilised countries, or the standard of living
must come down in keeping with the standard of
work performed.
His Honor says that figures produced in his
Court as to the reduction of output in
Australia, in spite of improved machinery,
are startling- The trouble is that they
don’t startle the right people—and time-
serving politicians who won’t tell the truth
are mostly to blame for it.
Willie Watt told the A.N.A. last week that
nothing on earth would induce him to rejoin
the Federal Ministry while Hughes is at the
head of it. Since he had fallen out with
the other William on “a vital matter of
policy,” he had as much right, he argued, to
nurse his wrath as the little autocrat had to
fondle his resentment against Labor. But
time softens the memory of these little un-
pleasantnesses. When Watt first offered
himself as a candidate for East Melbourne
(he was only a youngster then), Alec
Peacock, Premier and Liberal arbitrator,
turned him down in favor of another man.
Slightly over 12 years afterwards, Watt
"avenged” this treatment by taking Peacock
into his second Ministry, and then handing
him over the Premiership six months later.
One matter in contemplation in Sydney
concerns those “bonds,” bearing no interest
and never repayable, which the A.L.P. “in-,
duces” Sydney municipal employees to buy
so that there may be a fund to help the
Labor aldermen to re-election unless it is
spent otherwise. (Aldermanic positions carry
no ostensible salaries, but they seem to be
highly valued.) The idea is that the next
Government or the Federal Government may
make these bonds negotiable and recoverable
on demand. The selling by any employer,
of admittedly valueless notes or securities to
employees whom he can discharge or penal-
ise for not buying is extraordinary, and' the
position can only be regularised by giving
the notes a value. Anyhow, it is worth the
owners’ while to hoard them up on spec, and
to support the only party through which
they can hope to recover their money. And
that, of course, isn’t the party that issued
them.
According to the rules of the A.L.P. no
member of Parliament can be a member of
the executive. But officials who lately got
into the N. S. Wales Leg. Council didn’t
want to lose their duplicate jobs, so it has
just been decided that the Council isn’t Par-
liament, and an M.L.C. isn’t an M.P. He
may be a rabbit or a thistle —no one knows.
The number of subjects on which a State
Governor may not open his mouth without
objection being taken has been added to in
South Aus. Governor Weigall gave his
patronage to, and spoke warmly at, the
annual meeting of the Returned Soldiers’
Winegrowers’ Association. The local tee-
total Alliance has thereupon published a
“respectful protest,” calling the R.S.V.A. a
“purely sectional society. We regret,” it
added, “that his Excellency should have given
his blessing to the making of wine and
brandy.” But Weigall isn’t the first S. Aus.
Governor to find out that he is in danger the
moment he ceases to be a mere nodding
machine. How a State can be content to
pay a few thousands a year for a lay figure
passes comprehension.
An unflinching Roman father called Riley,
M.H.R., recommends that members should
refuse to attend the Federal Parliament till
it meets at Canberra. (But presumably
should collect their salaries as usual.) A
much more impressive idea would be for
Austin Chapman and the rest of the intense
Canberra-ites to go on hunger strike in
some public place. If Parliament couldn t
get to the new capital in time to save the
row of martyrs from extinction, their skele-
tons would at least remain to tell a tale.
The poor percentage of votes polled at the
Vic. elections has started an agitation for
compulsion. Jocook and Watt have de-
clared against it. Lawson is hedging—he
“does not think the time far distant when
it will be required.” Prendergast, the Labor
leader, favors the principle, but is confident
that the proportion of those who voted lately
was higher than the officials make out. On
the whole it looks as if forced voting will
be left to the debating societies for another
few years. Meantime the country cries for
more education rather than more compulsion.
“Lou” • Theodore’s recent attack on the
I.WAV. section of the A.W.TJ. wasn’t alto-
gether popular in Caucus. Since the Reds
broke away their criticism (from outside)
has been embarrassing the A.L.P. heads, and
the Melbourne conference, to which all the
extremists were invited, was really designed
to blanket that criticism by getting it inside,
as it were. In which object it succeeded,
partly because the tactics of the Reds, since
the Russian business, anyhow, are to get
on the inside of all labor organisations. But
now Theodore has blundered into the crock-
ery-shop and antagonised the very people
his party didn’t want to antagonise.
From an article printed in the Sydney
morning papers last week :
One of the strangest fights in the history of the
city is proceeding between the newspapers and the
Mayor. Nine of the principal newspapers are at-
tacking the Mayor bitterly, pointing out that the
municipal budget is a miracle oi inconrpetency.
Investigation of the city administration leveais
countless extravagances, malpractices and absurdities.
Oddly enough, its appositeness notwithstand-
ing, it wasn’t written of Sydney. It is taken
from an account of the state of affairs in the
other Tammanv city, New York. Of course,
the N. Y. Tammany is about 60 years
older than the Sydney institution, and
its opportunities are much greater. It
controls the schools (many of them
are said to be death-traps) and the police
(accused of bringing about, apparently by
collusion with the criminals, “the greatest
crime-wave in New York’s history”), runs
huge markets (the market commissioners
are charged with taking enormous bribes)
and has the handling of 400.000,000 dollars
in a year. But in its origin, its methods
of organisation, its fondness for doing
things behind closed doors and its odd habit,
when tackled about the rates and the deficit,
of making passionate speeches about the
sufferings of Ireland, it exhibits a remark-
able resemblance to the bright young
creation of Sydney’s floating vote. What
New York’s Tammany is, in fact, Sydney s
Tammany may become —if Sydney is mad
enough to let it.
THE DISCORDS OF PARTY HARMONY.
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
(< lf votes were in accordance with the utterances of
speakers the Government would be defeated.”
Though false in word, most true in vote,
The party does its party job;
All sheep without a single goat,
It still knows sixpence from a bob.
It knows that in the wilderness
The stones are bleak and hard to eat;
And that its bosses still can bless
The noisy faithful with a seat.
And so it makes a Splendid row
Arid eVen bites its leader’s heel,
Bht is as docile as a Cbtv
At the division bell’s appeal.
The Ministry is cool and caliii
And keeps its seat and knows its fate,
Though all its followers sing the psalm
Of perfect and fraternal hate.
Outside, the public wonders long,
With much assistance from the press,
How men who go so often wrong,
As all their candid friends confess,
Can keep their jobs and make them pay
In spite of all their party’s fuss.
But that’s the gentle party way ;
And that’s how they walk over us !

The statesman answered with a yell
That shook the Grampians to the core.
He spoke in Welsh; and that was well
For Presbyterians round the door.
From Connemara to Maynooth,
All Ireland’s fate hung on a tooth.
What were the woes of ancient days,
The present claims of right and w'rong,
The talk about divided ways,
The hint-of vengeance to the strong?
One traitor molar held more pain
Than all the anger of Sinn Fein!
The dentist’s iron fist gripped hard,
He pulled and pulled with might and main ;
The Scottish winds were singed and charred ;
The bonds of Empire felt the strain ;
And then .a limp, sad statesman knew
What tortured Ireland went through.

The Union Bank closes its books on the
last day of February each year, but the
accounts are not presented in London until
towards the end of July. Though the latest
figures are to some extent ancient history,
they are of considerable interest. In no
other year have such large .surplus profits
gone into visible reserves. For the six years
to 1919 the annual additions were £34,100;
last year, after giving shareholders 15 p.c.
on paid capital which had increased from
two to 2 \ millions, £121,341 was left:
Though the improvement of profits was no
doubt due largely to abnormal exchange
earnings on Commonwealth and Dominion
record imports, and also to some extent
to the larger volume of the advances
resulting from this importing orgy and the
drought, compared with previous years there
were other factors operating. The directors
had been regularly writing down the book
value of Government securities to market
level or below, and last year further large
provisions in that respect may not have been
necessary. These depreciation allowances
are a big item when more than two millions
of public securities are under review. But
one way and another, despite the various
contingencies which have been provided for,
the Union Bank has had a great harvest.
This shows how 7 disclosed gross profits have
expanded:—•
1914.. £700,978 | 1919.. £944,803
1917.. 813,759 | 1920.. 1,104,474
1918.. 886,380 | 1921.. 1,361,430
Meantime, outgo has behaved in this way :

Total . . £376,470 £646,372 £845,089
Expenses have forged ahead much more
speedily than earnings: they now take 62.1
p.e. of gross profits, compared with 53.7 p.c.
seven years ago. Outgoings, however, may
not have been quite so heavy as the figures
shown for the past year indicate: £joo,ooo
of the £177.119 taxation charges, the chair-
man told shareholders at the annual meet-
ing, was “provision” for income-tax and
Corporation Profits Tax, the new levy by
the British Treasury.
The 15 p.c. div. is not all it looks: the
£500,000 share issue of two years ago was
put out at a 100 n.c. premium. Reserves far
exceed paid capital: there are 500,000 £l5
shares paid to £5 (21 millions), but reserves
total £2.833.057. This shows the outside
money in the business and where funds
have been put to work at various dates: —

Figures as at February 28 last are too old
to call for much attention now, but the com-
parison of fluid assets and advances over
12 months shows the big changes brought
about by over-importing and by the drought.
Notwithstanding this strain put on the bank,
it held 37 p.c. of all liabilities in liouid form.
It had the care of about £6 11s. of the pub-
lic’s money for every £1 of its own funds,
and that was well vuthin prudent bounds.,

1921.. 31,367 Nil 70,336
A substantial loss as a result of the past
year’s operations was not unexpected; the
sudden collapse of the wool, hides, skins and
tallow markets last year entirely wrecked
many old businesses. If £31,367 represents
the full extent of Wilcox-Moffiin’s losses,
then it will have got through remarkably well,
It was generally expected that the co. would
have been more severely mauled, for, unlike
many others in the business, during the
period of depression it was faced with the
cost of upkeep of numerous branches. Though
the co. in its present form lias been in
business only four years, it is an amalgama-
tion of two old concerns —Geo. Wilcox &
Co., Ltd., and Wm. Mofflin & Co., Ltd.—
the founders of which were in partnership in
Adelaide in the long-ago. For two years 8
p.c. divs. were paid on £260,000 of capital,
a parcel of which —size unknown —repre-
sented scrip issued for goodwill. In 1920
the co. made its big punch in abnormally
high markets with a net profit equal to 42
p.c. on paid capital, which had grown to
£350,000. On that divs. aggregating 23 p.c.
were paid, but 10 p.c. (£35,000) was evi-
dently applied to the purchase of new shares
at par. Even after making these very liberal
distributions to shareholders £71,765 was
available for reserves. So the co. could well
afford to drop the £31,367 shown as the loss
for the past year.
The trade has now got back to something
like normal, and it is unlikely that violent
market fluctuations like those of last, year
will be experienced in the near future.
There has been an improved demand and
better prices for most of the lines handled.
The directors report that when taking stock
as at June 31 everything was “carefully
valued on a conservative basis.” From this
survey or the balance-sheet figures over three
years, it is possible to gauge in another way
how the co. has emerged from the booms and
slumps:—
1918. 1920. 1921.
Paid capital .. .. £260,000 £350,000 £400,000
Liabilities .. .. 206,140 *261,041 203,915

will (less depreciation
reserve) . . . . 257,009 290,031 299,935

Book debts .. .. 51,624 264,845 179,618
Cash 561 3,172 13,439
Paid capital has increased by £140,000 since
1918, hut one-fourth of that represents the
special distribution of profit 12 months ago,
which enabled shareholders to take up one
new share for 10 held. In the introductory
table this'distribution is treated as a div.,
directly paid to shareholders. The book
value of fixed assets and goodwill (less the
depreciation reserve) has expanded £42,92 >
and the surplus of more or less liabilities
lias moved from £31,958 to £180,553. That
shows an increase of net assets of £191,521.
or an improvement in the co.’s position of
£51,521 apart from the new capital got in
and after paying away £97,700 in divs., the
div, rate exceeding 10 p.c. p.a. notwithstand-
ing that nothing has gone to shareholders
during the past 12 months. The eo. lias thus
done remarkably well. If the values given
stocks at June 30 hold, and there is every
prospect of that, the co. has net assets (in-
cluding goodwill) equal to 245. per £1 share.
That should mean at least that all the capi-
tal is represented by tangible assets.

Ben i'<l Watson’s amalgamated several old
businesses just 30 years ago, and the table
gives performances for the past decade.
It is a somewhat extraordinary record con-
sidering the nature of the business—the co.
deals mostly in high-class furnishings. In
1911 £65,000 of capital and £18,250 of re-
serves were employed: nowadays there is a
share capital of £453,191 to feed. There have
been some big changes during the period.
Ten years ago there was not : penny in pro-
perty. Later, the co. acquired a lease of the
premises in which it was housed, but in
1913 portion of the building collapsed. The
co. sued the landlords (the Hixson Trust)
for compensation, and won; then it pur-
chased the property, £74,620 being tied up
in that item in 1917. But despite the fact
that more funds had thus gone into pre-
mises than there had been paid capital a
few years earlier, the eo. was doing so well
'that divs. were lifted from 10 to 15 p.c. War
conditions, or rather the Commonwealth
Government’s method of financing A.I.F.
operations with 1.0.U.’5, favored the busi-
ness. For the two years 1918-19 visible sur-
plus profits practically equalled the amount
required to pay 15 p.c. l p.a. divs. The
expanded business and higher cost of stocks,
however, called for more capital, so two
years ago £37,500 of reserves was used as a
bait to attract a similar amount from share-
holders. But the co. was doing so hand-
somely that, besides maintaining 15 p.c. on
an ordinary capital which had been doubled,
more than was distributed went into re-
serves. The directors, led by chairman and
public-accountant Mason Allard, apparently
considered that the co. would continue to do
well, and actuated no doubt by threats of a
grab by some Treasury or other, they decided
to reconstruct to make the div. returns look
milder and to secure additional working
capital.
The new co. for a start conceded the
£30,000 of 6 p.c. Ist prefs. and £52,500 of
7 p.c. 2nd prefs. an extra 1 p.c. Ordinary
shareholders received £ for £ in fully-paid
scrip for their £150,000 of capital, but they
also got as a gift three new £1 shares paid
to 12s. 6d. for every two previously held.
The 3340 of employees’ shares also received
a bonus allotment of a similar number paid
to 38s. 9d. each. These bonus issues called
for £143,756, which was partly provided -for
by the capitalisation of the visible reserves
of £51,255, by valuing goodwill at £67,660,
the balance of £24,841 apparently being
found by taking credit for appreciated
values —the book value of premises has
moved from £87,250 to £lll,OOO. At July
31 all except £10,788 of the 7s. 6d. (£84,375)
callable on the bonus ordinaries had been
got in, and these changes had shown up in
the published balance-sheets: —

Cash, etc. .. 1,238 15,057 46,214 9,630
The past year’s profits were not nearly so
good as those for the preceding period.
Nevertheless, 8 p.c. divs. were paid with ease,
and that meant 154 p.c. on the old holding if
acquired at: par. and 8 p.c. on the new money
put in. The return is even better to old
holders in view of the capitalisation of
£37,500 of reserves in the previous year. So
those who bought in at a premium of a
couple of shillings a few years ago have
done remarkably well.
The table above sets out clearly the pre-
sent position of the co. There are no longer
tangible assets to represent values shown by
the scrip—after payment of the latest divs.
£61,180 was represented by goodwill. When
the unpaid calls are in there will be net
tangible assets with a book value of 17s.
to represent each £1 ordinary. Whether
Beard-Watson’s will continue to do so well
in future as during recent abnormal years is
a matter the investor must decide for him-
self. This much may, however, be said : in
its very prosperous days the eo. has by
extensive advertising built up a valuable
goodwill, and this may to some extent be a
set-off against the fact that it. deals largely
in lines which are not likely to be regarded
as necessaries in bad times.

That table is a record of a good recovery.
The Modern began in 1870, was badly bruised
in Melbourne’s big smash, and had a narrow
escape from total extinction. Having now
got tlje div. rate to 10 p.c. the directors are
moved to tell of happenings in the past 20
years
In 1901 the Society was still loaded with a mass
of properties thrown on its hands which it was im-
possible to realise except at a ruinous sacrifice. The
arrangement with , its creditors was drawing to a
close, and if an immediate liquidation had been
forced there would have been nothing left for the
shareholders and less than 20s. in the £ for the
creditors. In 1902 a further arrangement was come
to with the creditors under which they were to re-
ceive 2s. 6d. in the £ in 1903, and annual instal-
ments of Is. 3d. till the whole indebtedness was
liquidated, together with not less than 3 per cent,
or more than 5 per cent, per annum interest. Under
this scheme the final payment would have been made
in 1917. Realisation of properties, however, pro-
ceeded sufficiently well to enable the whole of the
old indebtedness to be paid off by 1910, and the
Society was free to resume active business.
The remaining assets and also the capital were
then written down, hut though, much pressure was
exercised both by a large proportion of the sliare-
holders and a portion of the then Board to sell out
. or liquidate the Society, these efforts were success-
fully resisted and a career of gradually increasing
prosperity was entered upon. During the 11 years
- which have since elapsed not a sixpence has been
• lost on the many hundreds of loans which have been
made.
How the business has been built up since the
1910 reconstruction is shown in this <• n.
parison:—

Liabilities. . .. £29,588 £44,098 £46,900 £43,961

Premises . . .. 50,000 50,000 50,000 50,000
Other assets . . 1,384 550 4,133 2,823
The knife had been used too severely when
the book values of old foreclosures and other
assets were being pruned, and realisations
have given the eo. £13,170 more than the
management considered the assets were worth
in 1910. Last year the last of the house
properties was unloaded, and only a very
small parcel of vacant land is now on the
co.’s hands. So not much more profit will
be won from realisations from now on. The
conversion of the old assets into cash, the
accumulation of surplus profits and the addi-
tional deposits entrusted to the co. have
enabled it to lend out half as much again
as was advanced 10 years ago. This expan-
sion and higher interest rates have doubled
profits; but there is not much left after pay-
ing 10 p.c. divs. The Modern could handle
a much larger business if it could get
more funds, but the times are not favorable
for building societies to secure cheap money,
and perhaps that is just as well for the
more venturesome until conditions become
settled. This one shows very substantial
support for its creditors. Of the liabilities
of £43,961 shown above, £25,247 is a mort-

were written down to £50,000 and last year

Hume Pipe Co. (Australia), Ltd. —
Having made a success of a process for
manufacturing steel-concrete pipes, and hav-
ing considerable prospective business, Ilume
Bros. 12 months ago introduced this co. to
the public, inviting subscriptions for 150,000
£1 ordinaries, the old proprietors getting
210,000 fully-paids, 100,000 of the shares
being for patent rights. The float was under-
written and the co. commenced work in
October last, though it took over as from
July 1. The first balance-sheet is now out.
Including the -£lOO,OOO for patent rights the
prospectus showed a surplus of assets over
liabilities in excess of the vendors’ considera-
tion of £24,738, but £12,760 of that has
slipped in “subsequent adjustments” which
are not explained, though an explanation as
to why the prospectus figures are not all they
seemed is due to shareholders. Of the bal-
ance of £11,978, £llO9 has been utilised to
write-off one-third of the preliminary exes,
and £2500 to write down the £7500 under-
writing commission, which was 5 p.c. on the
issue. Adding to the balance the £1362
profit earned by the old co. prior to the new
one taking over, the co. started with nominal
reserves of £9731. Those intermediate pro-
fits, by the way, hint that during the three
months the old co. was earning at the rate
of under 21 p.c. p.a. on the prospectus value
of net assets transferred. Profits since the
new co. took over are given as £19,986 after
providing for taxation. A 5 p.c. div. is paid,
£5OOO is written off patent rights, and £1204
goes into the current accounts. Of the capi-
tal of £322,515 intangibles represent £91,283.
The co. has so far not got into its stride.
New works and additions to old ones have
been completed at Oobdolga (Murray River),
Perth and Brisbane, about £55,000 having
been spent in this way. A considerable
amount of funds has apparently also been
sunk in the co. which is to operate the Hume
patents outside the Commonwealth: the pros-
pectus did not disclose details as to the
capitalisation of this subsidiary, but indicated
that the old co. held a £15,000 interest in an
English concern which had secured the
patents. The first balance-sheet of the new
co. shows £46,825 in “shares in other cos.,”
but the directors are silent on the progress
made abroad. They announce, however,
that "valuable contracts” have been secured
from the 8. Aus. and Westralian Govern-
ments. At June 30 £37,255 of the £150,000
issue remained uncalled. Liabilities totalled
£117,395: nut there were liquid assets of
£184,268, not including shares in other cos.
National Portland Cement was the show
that was floated with John Monash as its
big light till Lawson switched him on to
Morwell. Now Bowes Kelly is the arc. He
has had £220.407 paid in cash to play with,
and preliminary exes, were £33,703. The
Maria Island rights, with buildings, free :
holds and leases, have cut out £42 364, and

war had evolved any new cement-
plant. He concluded apparently that
there wasn’t much to learn. Over Longoni’s
trip and in fossicking things out at Maria
Island, and in_ nosing out all about East
Coast coal, £11,572 has flown. Offers of coal
shows were turned down wholesale on the
stated ground of poverty of transport, but
the real reasons are probably the high per-
centage of asli and low calorific value of
Tassy coal. If a railway ran to Dalmayne
the verdict might be altered. Instead, fuel
is to be got from Newcastle,
Mt. Lyell is making big efforts to produce-
copper profitably under post-war conditions.
A monthly ore output of about 9500 tons
from the North Lyell and 6000 tons from
Mt. Lyell is being maintained with nearly 200
men less than in March last, and that alone
represents a yearly saving of £40,000. * The
ore-sorting plant at the reduction works con-
tinues to do good work, the North ore being
sorted up to a grade of 14 p.c. copper before
being sent to the furnace. The Hancock
jig, which forms the most important addition
to the flotation plant, is producing concen-
trates grading approximately 20 p.c., while
the flotation plant is now producing con-
centrates grading 18-20 p.c., as against 10-12
p.c. a year ago. Less Lyell pyritic ore is
required now owing to the recent improve-
ments in .treating the North ore.
* * * *
The fact of the White Hope deciding on
liquidation, when it has £50,000 of cash in
hand, is a bad advertisement for Westralian
gold-mining. There are several promising
shows which the co. might have acquired or
bought into. It is alleged that when shares
weakened to 45., though there were liquid
assets equal to over 6s. per share, insiders
bought heavily, and that that move accounts
for the co. being put out of business. Mine,
plant, equipment, etc., has been sold lock,
stock and barrel to manager Giblin and
others for £6OOO. Presumably the new
owners will take out all the pay ore in sight
and then abandon the show.
* * * *
Following on recent finds at 2000 ft. and
below, Lake View (W.A.) is regarded by
local admirers as having been born again.
There is, they declare, as much wealth left
as has been taken out. There is a feeling
on the spot that the old mine is on the verge
of developments that will at least put a new
bloom on it. A. H. Collier, a former Adel-
aide broker, and for years a director of the
co., is now on the way from London to
inspect and report to the Board. Develop-
ments are certainly promising.
* * * *
There has been another reshuffling of
terms in connection with the sale of Ives’
Reward (W.A.). This time the vendors
have agreed to accept the balance of pur-
chase money (£9000) in four instalments
extending over two years, and the co. has
undertaken to hand over with each instal-
ment a proportion of the 25,000 negotiable
paid-shares now held in escrow. It is im-
portant that contributing shareholders, who
have just been stirred up for one 6d. call
and will be called upon for another in Decem-
ber, should understand the position. The
co. has an undeveloped and practically un-
equipped mine of doubtful possibilities on
which it still has a cash liability of about
£lB,OOO, which includes outstanding deben-
tures, interest, etc. To put the property on
a fairly sound developmental footing, to say
nothing of equipment requirements, would
take at least another £20,000. Provided
prospects warranted this outlay, the inter-
esting question is where the money is to come
from. Interested parties will naturally assert
that the mill will do the trick. But apart
from some stone at grass, which is declared
to' be worth 15dwt. per ton, dependence
is placed upon the alleged “£40,000 profit in
sight.” Mill performances, however, do not
always bear out official estimates. The out-
look is -so uncertain that contributing share-
holders should insist on all call-money being
earmarked for development and plant, and
arrange that vendors, and even debenture-
holders, be paid out of gold won and that
the paid shares be handed over only when
the deal has been completed. Otherwise
there is a danger of big wads of negotiable
r"id shares being thrown on the market
Lom time to time, and of money subscribed
in calls going to the vendors. Without these
safeguards the property from a contributing-
shareholder’s point of view is not worth
bothering with.

A Perth co., headed by A. E. Morgans
and others, has lately been, extracting copper
by means which they claim will revolution-
ise the treatment of ores containing the red
metal, and possibly those having gold as
well. The process is rapid, simple, cheap
and gives high recoveries. The ore is
slimed, and an acid or a salt is added, to-
gether with metallic iron and water. The
mixture is then heated and agitated by a
steam jet, and in a few minutes cement cop-
per is precipitated. In the chemical action
that occurs the acid or salt regenerates, and
all that is lost is the iron. State Mining-
Engineer Montgomery is impressed by
laboratory tests, but says that the success
of the process in bulk treatment has yet to
be demonstrated. That is the rock on which
quite a number of promising laboratory pro-
cesses have split in the past.
Tributors are still making money for
Associated Northern, at Kalgoorlie, though
there isn’t much left to work on. Liquid
assets are estimated to be worth between
3s. and 4s. per share, but there are interests
in Mexico and elsewhere, and some of the
cash assets may be swallowed by those
shows.

Kalumpang (F.M.S.), for its third year
of life, slipped because of the slump in tin
and the extra cost of mine-supplies. So,
though it got out 321| tons oxide against
285! tons in 1920, it collected only £48,840
against £58,180 for the lesser tonnage in
the previous year. As costs for the two
terms were respectively 6.26 d. and 6.76d-
per c. yd., the working protit fell from 9d.
to 5.15 d. per yd. Nevertheless the co. made
£18,515 net, and with £11,825 in hand was
able to pay out £11,298 towards the pur-
chase of 378 acres alongside its present block.
The total cash consideration for the ground
is to be £15,000 and 30,000 fully-paid £1
shares in a new Kuala Lumpur Tin (Jo. with
a-capital of £250,000 in £1 shares. A wad
of 50,000 paids will go to the Kamunting
shareholders, and 70,000 will finally be
offered them to get the funds to place a new-
dredge on the claim. This purchase looks
to be a good deal, for times are hard and
tin shows can now be picked up for a frac-
tion of the money asked in the recent boom.
Kalumpang henceforward will control 515
acres, which, on boring done, are expected
to average a pound. Having bagged the
land the Board need not hurry to equip, for
plant is slumping in price and no good is
done by bringing more tin-mines into bear-
ing until stocks held by the Malayan and
Dutch East Indies Governments are worked
off. Kuaia Lumpur, where the co. is work-
ing, is noted for the even grade of the ground,
so it is pardonable for barrister Meagher to
do a bit of high-falutin about a long life
and good returns for Kalumpang-

.Ajax North, Daylesford (Vic.), received
£5584 from the Mint during the co.’s latest
half, and got £2055 premium from the Gold
Droducers’ Association. It made a loss of about
£lOO. Four levels are being kept going from
No. 6 to No. 9. Manager Hansen wisely
keeps poking about above 800 ft. to locate
any fresh shoots in either Ajax or McMillan
formations. So far only slates and sandstone
have shown.at No.. 6. In No. 7 the. middle
reef has been shattered by faults, and
though a lot of the east reef is poor stuff it
gives most of the pay dirt. Developments
south at No. 8 show a large body of stone
which, with the present gold premium,
should pay. North is another disturbed
region to baffle the man out for cheap work,
and the gold present fails to furnish profits.
Hansen has a big development programme in
hand, and especially wishes to get south
with his No. 9 level, as the shoots of gold
pitch in that direction. At No. 6, by doing
600 ft. of cross-cutting, he will intersect six
known reefs, from most of which some gold
has been got at different points in the claim.
The issue is whether this prospecting is in a
zone carrying gold, for Daylesford shoots of
pay stuff are generally associated with defi-
nite types of country rock.

Kempsey (N.S.W.) recently became ex-
cited about a gold discovery which had been
made about 5u miles away on the Macleay
River. But all the glitter has faded : 6dwt.
gold and -ioz. silver was the best offering on
closer investigation.

The closing down of the Titanic, at Kan-
garoo Hills (Q.), has confounded the local
prophets, and, incidentally, It just about
means the finish of the old Brilliant Extended
Co., of Charter's Towers. It looked to be on
winner when it bought the Titanic last
November for £5OOO. At that time that show
was reckoned to be the second- or third-best
mine on the field. The ore at grass pur-
chased with the mine returned nearly £lOOO.
But the lode lias pinched, and the poor price
of tin has discouraged shareholders. The
Extended Co. had the most efficiently-run
mine at the Towers, although it was far
from being the richest, and it distributed
£150,000 in dividends up to 1916. In 1917,
with a few thousands in its stocking, it
transferred its attention to Kangaroo Hills
and acquired the Salmon, which, like the
Titanic, turned out a failure.
An effort is likely to be made to resusci-
tate the Woolgar goldfield, near Etheridge
(N.Q.), and the local people will subscribe
half the capital required if the Department
is prepared to subsidise work and make an
advance towards machinery. The Mines
Department is obtaining a report on the
lodes. Some good returns of alluvial gold
came from the field prior to 1880. but reefing
had its best period between 1883 and 1886,
when 11,000 tons stone were crushed for
about 12,0000 z. gold. Croydon, however,
beguiled a lot of the miners away in 1886,
as the ore was getting difficult to treat and
the plant crude. The glamor of other near-
by fields militated against it getting a really
good trial.
Having promised to have some of the
workings on the old Palmer field (Q.) un-
watered and examined, the Queensland Mines
Minister recently sent up a geologist to report
on the prospects of the Louisa and several
other reefs that local prophets had tipped as
winners. As a result, it is not likely that
the Mines Department will financially back
operations on any of those examined. Values
fluctuate widely, and the reefs are small. So
the Palmer looks as if it will slumber on
undisturbed.
* * * *
Prospecting is being continued in the Vul-
can, at Irvinebank (Q.), but there have been
no notable developments so far. Boring on
the 1400 ft. level has been discontinued for
the time being, as this work was eating a
big hole in funds. Attention is now concen-
trated on the 750 ft. level, where there is a
chance of picking up the shoot that came
away from the 600 ft. level. Tributors are
working down to 600 ft., and some are mak-
ing fair wages. Further calls will have to
be raked in to thoroughly test the old mine.
The last face of ore sampled at Silver
Spur (Q.) gave a return of 620 z. silver and
7oz. Tdwt. gold. The highest silver assays
from the new lode have run to 160 oz. This
is the best the mine can show in its long
record, and even if it is only a patch it will
be useful to assist in getting in capital for
a smelting plant. Other patches have shown
soz. and 60z., so the ore blocked out should
give a good average.
* * * *
Several gold-bearing reefs carrying anti-
mony were Recently discovered in new
auriferous country six miles from Cooktown
(Q.). Samples sent to the Mines* Depart-
ment showed up to 440 z. gold. An official
report is now being made on the find.
The Barn Bluff “oil-find” in the Speck
is meeting with the fate so usual to Aus-
tralian oil shows. Geologist Hills has
been castigating the promoters for the in-
ference that asphaltum was found on the
area, and their claims as to its relation to
liquid-oil pools. He states that the oil-
bearing gangue is a sapropelic- coal (pelion-
ite), and that does not exist there,
nor is there the slightest justification for
the statement that liquid-oil is likely to be
found in the Barn Bluff-Pelion area.

Tasmania Gold Mine for the year ending
March returned a further 6d. per share and
carried forward a credit balance of £4700.
So far the liquidator has returned 2s. 6d. per
share (£62,500). The brick mine-buildings
are still unsold, although the Speck Govern-
ment is inclined to buy, the idea being to use
them for industrial purposes. No offers
have been received for the slimes dump,
amounting to many thousands of tons, owing
to the refractory nature of the contents.
The estate on the Tamar River has not
proved the good asset as an orchard area that
was confidently expected. The co. appears
to have missed the land boom there, and the
area is now sub-let to a timber contractor.
The war shortage enabled the co. to sell
much gear at good prices.

In the No. 4 level of North Mt. Farrell
(Tas.), going north beyond the fault zone,
the continuation of the lode has been picked
up. Its average width is 6ft., and it goes
18 p.c. lead and 15oz. silver —a splendid
milling proposition. It is in new ground as
far as the main mine workings are concerned,
and opens up big possibilities for the continua-
tion of the ore shoot above and below this
level. Driving for the main lode from off
the No. 5 level is now being pushed. Every-
thing seems to be right with the mine bar
the metal market and sale conditions.
* * * *
At old and once-famous Mt. Jasper cop-
per (Tas.) a level is being driven off the
winze northward on the 6in. silver-lead lode
of the Mt. Wright area. This small and
slender deposit is the mainstay of the co.
nowadays. The ore is of fairly high silver
and lead content, set in semi-dolomite
country, but is hard to get out, and the show
is a long way from a market. Manager
O’Connor has rock-drills speeding develop-
ment, and a shipment is accumulating
towards the dividend that never comes, and,
on present appearances, never will. For
misguided optimism and persistency this co.
has no equal in the Speck.
The completion of the liquidation of the
Tas. Copper Co. is now in sight, Metals Ex-
traction Co. having failed to lodge its appeal
against the adverse decision of Justice Ast-
bury in England. Legal costs amounting to
£625 of the £7OO given against the Extrac-
tion Co. have been paid by the old Mt. Read
Co., subject to its release from any further
liability. Finality has not yet been reached
in the matter of the Copner Co.’s share-
holding in the Electrolytic Zinc Co. —due to
it because of the 97,500 shares it held in the
old Mt. Read Co. —but the liquidator hopes
to receive the scrip shortly.
* * * *
South Bischolf (Tas.) is about to resume
crushing. A level is being driven on the
lode track from olf the floor of the mill site
to cut the winze in the No. 1 level-, where
there is a small block of fair grade in sight.
About 20ft. of backs will result, and enough
tin will in all probability be won to square
the ledger—that is, if the co. can find a
reasonable market for the product.
The once-famoi.s Waiotahi mine, for many
years one of the most productive on the
Thames (M.L.) field, was sold the other day
for £5O. The co. which owned it was regis-
tered in 1871 with a capital of £15,000, and
paid £45,000 in dividends up to 1901 out of
a total yield of £197,346. In November,
1905, a fresh strike was discovered, and up to
1917 the total output was £6,737,798-. On
the original 6000 shares paid to £2 10s. divi-
dends totalling £35 10s. per share were paid.
Ilochstetter Goldfields (M.L.) cleaned up
in their last return 109 oz. for 510 hours
sluicing, The last three clean-ups have re-
turned gold to the value of £l6OO. A second
face is now being opened up with the im-
proved water supply available, and results
should be considerably improved.
* * * *
The consistent producer and dividend-
payer, Big River gold (M.L.), is on to some-
thing good at the lowest intermediate level.
There the stones are 205 ft. in length, with
a width running up to 20ft. The co. is
mostly Reefton-owned.

(76). Alexander was the youngest of the
lot, and to the others was always “boy.”
The sister (deceased) was related by mar-
riage to the late Edmund Barton.
Mackrell, one of the most amiable of the
Hayseeders in the Vic. Assembly, was the
candidate who went to the fancy-dress ball
at Mansfield
dressed as a bush-
ranger. The Age
had described him
as a political bush-
rang e r, and he
made use of it to
secure an immense
ad. —especially in
the district that
knows something
of the real thing,
as the monument
to Sergeant Ken-
nedy testifies.

George Whitfeld, wiio had been head of
N. S. Wales Crown Law Department for the
past two years, died last week, aged 61. He
was a brother of “Lou” Whitfeld, the barris-
ter who collapsed from a heart attack while
playing golf a few years ago, and like him
was immensely popular with the profession.
He worked his way up through all the stages
of the Public Service, which he entered 40
years ago as a Survey Departfiient drafts-
man. The end was expected: he had been
an invalid more or less for the past year.
It was a sorrowful Wimmera (Vic.) tlia+
heard Weldon Power had passed out and
was going back to Horsham in a casket.
Till Hagelthorn induced him to become soli-
citor to the Vic. Wheat Commission and
to the Australian Wheat Hoard in 1015.
Power was everything to the Wimmera—
the king-pin of all local movements, and
hospitable, generous and good company into
the bargain. The cockies were grateful
him because he steered the Commission and
the Board safely through a course that hr '
dozens of uncharted rocks. He was a
widower without family, and only 58.
Dr. Paul, like his friend poor Claude
Tozer, Colonel Watt, of the A.F.C., and
Colonel Marks, of the 13th Battalion, was a
Sydney man who saw active service abroad
only to meet his end by a mischance at
home. He was driving with Dr. Howard
Bullock to a dance on Friday night, when
something happened to the * car' and Iris
death resulted. He was one of the five
doctor-sons of John Paul, of Sydney, and
served in France with, the R.A.M.O. After
the war he resumed practice as a Macquarie-
street eye specialist, and was recognised as
one of the best of the younger men. He
was only 36.
Littleton Groom, Hughes’s Minister for
Works and Railways, has just completed 20
years in the Federal Parliament. He took
over his late dad’s seat in September, 1901,
and at every election Toowoomba has sent
him back with a substantial majority. Groom
has the longest record of office of any mem-
ber in the present Parliament. He was in
the second and third Deakin Administra-
tions and had a billet under Joe Cook before
he joined the present team. He is an
extremely amiable little man: indeed, one
member, who had tried to make him fight,
summed him up this way: “The most objec-
tionable thing about Groom is that he is so
■un ob j ection able. ’ ’
Ex-member and ex-soldier Con. Wallace
died in hospital at Auburn (N.S.W.) last
week. He was a son of Misfortune, who is
an unmarried lady with a large family.
He held the dead-sure Labor seat for West
Sydney for two years (1917-1919) when the
salary was only £6OO a year. He had the
nomination for 1919: but T. J. Ryan came
along, so Con Wallace made room for him
and went to put up a hopeless scrap at
Nepean. It was taken for granted that some
sort of billet had been promised to Wallace,
and when the billet turned up it was that
of shipping-master at Brisbane, the pay bein°-
a wretched £220 a year. So Con Wallace
united home again in search of more bread
and cheese. Ryan’s sudden death left his
old West Sydney seat vacant, and he had
another try for it. But the pushful Lam-
bert now wanted it as badly as the pushful
Ryan did in 1919. So, being rejected, Con
Wallace closed the chapter of ingratitude
by dying suddenly himself.
The bright apprentice who married his
boss s daughter and thus laid the foundation
ot Ins fortunes was James IJilman Sev-
mour, who has just faded out when well
on Ins way to the century. lie saw the
light at Bandon, near Cork, and learned the
business of ironmonger at Parson’s Town
from \\. K. Fayle, the father-in-law-to-be.
to Melbourne in ’54 he joined up
with \\ alter I'owell in business, but he is
best remembered as a partner in the Cham-
bers and Seymour firm, whose shop at the
corner of Collins and Swanston streets was
for ages as well known as the Town Hall.
Since 1909 the firm has carried on in the
L linde'rs-street: building where the Evening
Standard had a funeral.
Tom Skeyhill, the man who wrote those
recent striking Bulletin articles about Rus-
sia from the inside, jumped off the ’Frisco
boat when she tied up in Sydney last week.
Skeyhill, who left us as “the blind signaller,”
has gone far since that second year of the
war. In the U.S.A. he not only won back
his sight, but as a lecturer made'a name for
himself that almost the whole Republic
knows. Certainly no other Australian—not
even a Commonwealth Commissioner—-has
gained the friendship of so many front-rank
Americans; and in the drives for the
Liberty, V ictory and other loans he was on
the platform with dozens of them. He will
be about two months in Australia, whose
home-centre for him is Hamilton, in Victoria.
Then lie will go back by the Makura to take
up his lecture schedule, which starts in
N’-York city in December. But he has
hopes of getting away to . Russia again some
time , next year. “This ' Russian experiment
is far too important to miss,” he says.
J. E. Bowden, who passed out at Parra-
matta (N.S.W.) last week in his 86th year,
was. next to Gannon, the oldest solicitor on
the N. S. Wales roll, having started on'
liis Costs hunt in 1865. The Bowden familv
was founded in Sydney in 1812 by one of
two dominies sent by the British' Govern-
ment to instil the three R’s into Young Aus-
tralia.
Vic. Agent-General MeWliae, with his dame

January 14 by the Ormuz. Before he goes
lie will give a dinner to both Llodses of Par-
liament. nominally a welcome to State Trea-
surer McPherson, just back from his trip,
but really an ebullition of goodwill. He and
Northcliffe should get on well together in
London. They have had a couple of chats,
and the Colossus dropped in to lunch at
Ellengerrin when he Was down in the south-
west for a few days.

MELBOURNE.
From a man who works with him :
The man in the N.S.W. Gallery (B. 8/9/’2l) is
wrong in his assessment of Dooley as “horribly
lazy.” Just now he is administering’ three Depart-
ments—the Premier’s, Chief Secretary’s and Housing
—which under the Nationalist regime were adminis-
tered by Holman, Fuller and Oakes, respectively,
and it is the claim of the Under-Secretaries oi these
Departments that never in all their experience have
41.e> ivmow a Minister to do the work more expe-
( j mouk v and thoroughly. Dooley, though stout, is
active, as several mountain-tourists recently found
when, in response to a challenge, he walked them to
a standstill. He keeps himself fit in winter by
morning strolls and ball-punching, and in summer
by daily visits to the surf.

Gone west at Marulan (N.S.W.) just
after his S6th birthday, Jack Hughes,
“white” bush man. He hadn’t been in the
Marulan district long when lie figured in
the wayside comedy staged by Ben Hall,
Gilbert and Dunn on December 19, ’G4, at
Shelley’s Fl-ats, 13 miles from Goulburn.
Hughes was riding home from Towrang
when he found a great collection of teams,
horses -and buggies lined up alongside the
road with tw T o bushrangers standing guard.
Hall “went through him” and found two
shillings, which were contemptuously re-
turned. He then joined the gang on the
roadside and watched the proceedings, which
consisted of sticking up every traveller who
came along for the best part of the day.
“What I never forgot,” the old man used to
say, “was Ben Hall’s remark about religion.
.Some of them had been talking about what
church they belonged to, and the bushranger
chipped in with a laugh : ‘You can tell every-
body you know that we don’t mix religion
with our politics !’ ”
The Rev. J. W. Ashton, vicar of All
Saints’, St. Ivilda (Vic.), is to put on the
Gaiters at Grafton (N.S.W.). The new
bishop toiled in the English vineyard, par-
ticularly attacking the phylloxera at North-
hampton and Market Harbdrough before
coming to St. Andrew’s, South Brisbane. A
trip to England followed : then he appeared
at St. Ivilda, where he has soothed a fash-
ionable flock for 10 years. Ashton is an
Oxford man, addicted to the higher mathe-
matics.
A very definite chin as a finish to a clean-
cut face was a prominent feature of the

it. A Weigall chin now presides over the

N.S.W. Parliament, C. E. Weigall having
succeeded Dr. G. W. Waddell as Chief
Parliamentary Draftsman. He was a prac-
tising barrister before he joined the staff,
and for years he has been understudy to the
man he now succeeds.
“Norbell”: The notorious Scully, of the
I.W.W. fire-dope cases, who was officially
wafted to America only to be hauled back
again for further cross-examination, died in
circumstances which ought to make barbers
and Health authorities do some hard think-
ing. Recently Scully had been running a
chemist’s shop in Oxford-street, Paddington,
and a few weeks ago he went into a barber’s
and had a shave. He mentioned that he
was feeling unwell and intended to go home,
lie did go home, took to his bed and at once
died. The dpctor said meningitis. Mean-
while the barber’s wife took the towel which
had been used in the shaving of Scully, and
included it in her daily wash. Then she too
sickened and died ; and the doctor said men-
ingitis. Since then the late Scully’s shop
has come to an appropriate end. It was
burnt out.

Dr. W. E. Jones, Vic. Inspector-General
of the Insane, who is to chairman the W.A.
Royal Commission which is to look into the

Asylum, is a dapper little Welshman, keen
on his work, with a knack of getting a good
deal of his own way. Under his administra-
tion (he is paid 11500 a year) the old, bad
conditions of asylum life are disappearing
in Vic. He is a golfer, dotes on music, and
had the good taste to marry an Australian
girl.
“MUVVERS.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
11l Phantasmagoria Mansions there are seventeen
“modern” flats,
Seventeen married coupler and eeven-and-twenty
eats ;
Gramophones, Poms., pianolas—with these the place
is alive,
But there’s only a single youngster, a queer little
sprite of five,
Fanciful, wise, maternal —you know what they are
at five.
She belongs to the Matheson Georges. Her parents
happened to know
That hard old doer the landlord, or they wouldn’t
have had a show.
He yielded at last to persuasion, but in forcible
terms and wild
Impressed on the graceless couple the crime of own-
ing a child.
Birds he didn’t objeek to, nor animals —not on your
life !—*
And he never went sour if a tenant decided to change
his wife.
He wasn't concerned with morals if nothing was
wrong with the wads,
But kids, he insisted bitterly, kids were over the
odds.
So the Georges came to the Mansions (they were
young and “wanted to save”),
Came, as it were, on probation, and Babs was warned
to “behave.”
Terrible things would happen, they said, if she
wasn’t good
And worried the other tenants. She stood it as long
as she could.
But, pining at last for playmates, tired of the same
old toys,
Sick of the stern injunction that she wasn’t to make
a noise,
She stole away for a frolic, clad in her prettiest
gown,
When Mummy was in the kitchen and Daddy had
gone to town;
Went on a morning visit to each of the other flats
Devoted to childless couples, canaries and Poms, and
cats ;
Knocked up the painted ladies, a trim little Miss in
red.
Daintily sashed and ribboned. “Will you play Muv-
vers?” she said.
“Muwers”—the childish question fell like a sudden
knock
On hearts not utterly selfish and others as hard as
rock.
It summoned up old impressions of a simpler age
that fled
When the craze for hectic pleasure got into woman’s
head,
And life became for my lady one long, mad, feverish
rout.
And the jazz came jn, and the cocktail, and the baby
(poor baby!) went out.
It took them back for a moment to a saner, healthier
time
Vdien folk hadn't made a fetich of an imbecile
Yankee mime,
And it wasn’t a wife’s ambition, the fierce desire
of her heart,
To live like Sockem, the bookie, and dress like
Sockem’s tart.
In one sharp surge of emotion their feminine thoughts
were swirled
Away from the pitiful shadows that make up a flat-
woman’s world:
Cocktails, “pitchers,” the races, comedies trashy and
lax,
What to put on their faces and what to wear on
their backs,
Bridge at the Hotstuff Tavern, jazz at the Go-for-
your-lifc,
Dashitall’s indiscretions with Parasite’s frisky wife,
Cigarettes, aspirin, bromide, their fretful, querulous
ills,
Goods that needn’t be mentioned and Plugg’s Infal-
lible Pills.
Such dreams came back to the ladies as Baby stood
at the door,
But the kindlier mood soon vanished and left them
the same as before ;
And one or two hags were angry and ordered the
mite away,
And all admitted that “Muwers” was a game they
didn’t play.
But the tale crept out of the Mansions and the whole
darned neighborhood smiled
At the jolt to the barren women—the challenging
words of a child.

SOCIETY
When the calamity fell on Mt. Mulligan
(N.Q.) there were 76 miners working in
the pit; only one badly-injured man—Evans,
the underground manager-—came out alive,
and he died a few days later. It was
Queensland’s worst mining accident and Aus-
tralia’s third worst —95 lives were lost at
Mount Kembla (N.S.W.) in 1902 and 81
at Bulli five years before. At Mulligan, as
at Bulli and Kembla, the heroism of the
rescue parties added a golden page to the
history of Australia’s industrialism. While
a spark of hope remained miners, engineers
and ambulance toiled feverishly, in circum-
stances of the utmost 'difficulty. and danger,
to reach the iufrprisoned men, and the work
went on until all but one of the 75 bodies
had been brought out. One old coaly—a man
with a crippled arm and an imperfectly knit
leg—actually limped away from the hospital
and lent a hand in bearing out the corpse of
his mate.
HOME, SWEET HOME.
“Are you sure your wife -will help you to
bed orright. of man?”
“Sure; she always does. I just make my
way to where the voice is coming from.”
“E.T.”: The recently-widowed Mrs. Wib-
bins invited her next-door neighbor, Mrs.
Pusey, in to have a “peep” at the body of
her late lamented. Mrs. Pusey, a stickler
for the proprieties, eyed the remains in
silence for a space, then turned to the
snuffling widow and remarked: “You should
have the poor dear’s face shaved—he’d look
much nicer. No man looks his best with
a two-days’ growth of beard.” “Oh, I don’t
think it matters,” the weeping widow mur-
mured ; “it ain’t like as if he was going
anywheres particular.”
“Patrick”: The Springboks were surprised
at the air of equality between Maori and
Pakeha in M.L., but contact with Hori soon
proved how he 'stands squarely on two feet.
The Yanks in France found that out too.
In one estaminet on July 3 a bombastic
American said to a Maori Pioneer: “Say,
Nigger, to-morrer’s the day we kicked the
British outa U.S.A., so I guess you’d better
keep your face outa here to-morrer.” The
Maori smiled and replied decisively: “Ta-
rn or rer te day te Maori awso do a bit er
frowin’-out.” The Maoris made' a point of
turning up on July 4, but those Yanks were
the civillest soldiers in Europe.

“F.E.C.”: An Austi’alian just back from
Japan tells it. Though on a business trip
he was accompanied by his wife, and, find-
ing he had to go inland to a very primitive
part for some days, he
left lier behind at the
hotel. As he was
leaving he casually re-
marked to a Jap man-
servant : “Look after
my wife well while
I’m away.”. On his
return he found her
on the verge of a ner-
vous breakdown. She
told him she’d been
through “a n awful
time.” Wherever she
was, night or day, the
door would open at
short intervals, very
quietly (there are no
locks in Japan), and
an impassive Oriental
face would look in on
her, then as quietly
withdraw —a perform-
ance that had nearly
scared her out of her
wits. The husband
was nonplussed until
he met the offending
Jap, and that worthy
hastened to tell him :
“Me look after Missie
well ; she very good
lady /”
“T. 0.1.”: Oct. 4 will be the 80th anniver-
sary of the laying of the foundation-stone of
St. Francis’s It.G. Church, Lonsdale and
Elizabeth streets, Melbourne. The spectacu-
lar bit of masonry was done by Father
Geoghegan, who was sent from Sydney as
the first R.C. shepherd of Port Phillip. A
bottle with scroll and coins was placed under
the stone, but in the night thieves lifted the
stone and also the coins. The church was
dedicated on Oct. 25, 1845. Father
Geoghegan in after years became Bishop of
Adelaide. Incidentally, it was to this padre
that Victoria owed John O’Shamassy, who
was on his way to Sydney in 1839, when he
was persuaded to make his home in Port
Phillip.

“One of Many”: The military mind is
hard to fathom. My boy was killed on
Gallipoli over six years ago, but I have just
received a parchment of the present date
and signed by the present Governor-Gen-
eral, professing to confer on him the rank
which he held from the outbreak of war,
and exhorting him to well-doing and per-
severance, with the prospect of promotion.
And this is sent with the evident expecta-
tion that one will recognise a pleasant com-
pliment and memorial. To an outsider it
would seem funny, no doubt; but somehow
his mother can’t see the joke at all. Women
have no sense of humor.

“M.D.’s” reflections on a plague epidemic:
I hope for the sake of my brother-professionals
that we won’t, have to wrestle with another epidemic
of bubonic plague in Sydney, though if we escape
an outbreak it will be by good luck more than
anything else, since a grave error was made in
Queensland in hiding the truth from the Federal
authorities, and another error was made in Sydney
in allowing the Wyreema to tie up before her holds
were examined for dead rats.
During the last epidemic we lived in hourly
dread lest the horrible disease should break out
amongst our favorite patients. We went with
nothing but plague in our minds, and it was a disease
about which we were entirely ignorant clinically.
We had read about it, of course, and knew the
physical signs and all that; but all the reading in
the World would avail us little when we were brought
face tp face with a case. I remember we. were
more than usually civil to one another, not know-
ing for certain when a rival’s services might be
necessary to clear up a knotty problem in consul-
tation.. We were continually , harassed by. the. dread.,
that we might overlook the disease and cause no
end of trouble by our want of discernment, so we
looked for plague on our daily round, and dreamed
of it at night. And when the call to our first case
eventually did come how anxiously we examined
the sufferer ; felt for the indefinitely-enlarged glands
in the groin; noticed the presence of fever and a
look of extreme illness that was not warranted by
the physical signs! We diagnosed bubonic plague,
reported the case to the Health authorities, who
sent over an expert as soon as the message arrived,
and the sufferer was whisked post-haste to Little
Bay. Our telephone bells rang continually, and scared
parents vowed that plague was in the house on the
slightest appearance of malaise in one of the family.
Fortunately, in nearly every instance it was a false
alarm. We grew to be heartily sick of the daily
score of the rat-catchers and the cleaning up of
the city, and our nerves tingled at the mere mention
of rats.
After a few weeks of anxiety, in which we lost
considerable weight, the culminating episode occurred,
and the scare in our suburb redoubled. I had been
called in to see a man in a little side street (I
see the house now, and could walk to it blind-
folded). He was cyanosed, and breathing very
THE ODDS AGAINST HIM.
“Do you think you could care for a chap
like me?”
“ Oh, yes, I think so —if he wasn’t too much
like you.”
rapidly,, though his pulse was not too bad. There
was much blood-stained sputum (luckily he did- not
cough while I was in the room or I should not be
writing this), but the physical signs of pneumonia
were by no means well marked: —there were cer-
tainly some crackles over the back of the chest but
there was no marked dulness. I told the relatives that
the patient was in extremis, and they promptly re-
jected my opinion and called in another doctor.
The patient, of course, passed out: so did several
more in the same house who had developed similar
symptoms, and a post-mortem rfevealed that death
resulted from pneumonic plague, the first case of
the . kind to occur in Australia. I found out after-
wards that in pl,ague pneumonia the physical signs,
were never very well marked. On the tenth day
after the appearance of the first; case I received a
visit from the late Dr. Ashburton Thompson, who
was surprised to find me alive arid apparently quite
well. He was going to inoculate me, but decided
that in my case the dangerous period, was over. He
had already inoculated the other doctors who were
called in after me. That experience scared me for
months, and led to the reflection that general prac-
tice when it came- to dealing with plague pneumonia
was not the game it was cracked up to be. Yet
in India every doctor, in the I.M.S. has to do his
six months’ plague duty, and he thinks nothing of
the ordeal.
“Sixenate”: Every schoolboy knows —un-
fortunately—where cigarettes' can be bought
after hours, but as the sale is illegal the
police are always surprised when they hear
about it. Sydney Central Court the other
day was dealing w’ith a woman who, having
taken a sailor to her home, left him in bed
whilst she dressed in his clothes, and went
out with another man. The charge was
theft, but the woman claimed that the whole
thing was a joke, and the seaman had even
asked her to get him some cigarettes. “Where
did you get the cigarettes after hours?”
asked the prosecuting policeman severely.
The answer came like a shot: “At a place
next the police station.”

“Friday Island” : The speed record across
Australia from south to north is held by Dr.
Austin Mahon, of Isisford (Q.). During
the war Mahon was surgeon in the Brisbane,
which received orders at Sydney to get to
Thursday Island without letting the grass
grow under its keel. Mahon at the moment
was on leave in Melbourne. He left Spen-
cer-street station by express train at 5 p.m.
on W ednesday, arrived at Sydney 11 a.m.
Thursday, and was hurried across the harbor
to the Brisbane, which was waiting with her
anchors “straight-up-and-down.” She belted
out for Thursdav Island at 27 knots —slow-
ing down to 20 for night travelling through
the ticklish Great Barrier. The only neces-
sary stop was to take in fuel from a collier
at sea near the Palm Islands. They arrived
in time for afternoon tea (or the Thirsty
Isle’s equivalent) on the following Tuesday.
Total distance, 2415 miles (land 591 miles,
sea 1524 miles) ; time of journey (including
coaling delay), six days. N.B.—The Bris-
bane was the first light cruiser to be con-
structed in Australia.

“Russ” : A woman was recently treated at
a Yic. hospital for swallowing a mouse.
There is no excuse for this sort of thing in
these days of cheap and effective mouse-traps.

“Cartot”: It happened at a Melbourne
metropolitan hospital. Among the day’s
outpatients was a Chinaman in a bad way,
and appendicitis was diagnosed. An opera-
tion was fixed for that afternoon, and Wun
Lung being entirely agreeable he was sent
home to attend to some private affairs and
told to return at 3 p.m. At that hour
everything was ready for the carving, and
right on time an impassive Chink was un-
dressed, washed and amethetised. Then the
operating surgeon scratched his head when
lie found-the appendix quite normal. But
such things do happen now and again, so
the incision was sewn up. Later, a few
pals of the patient called to see how he
was, and then it was discovered that the
man operated upon wasn’t Wun Lung at
all, but a comparatively newchum friend
whom Wun had despatched to inform the
hospital authorities that he felt all right
again and had changed his mind about being
cut open. The messenger explained that he
thought the earlier proceedings were some
form of ritual that he was compelled to
undergo.

“Tim Tiki” : While an R.C. missioner was
trying to put a Hamilton (M.L.) flock on
the way to the right pen the other Sunday
his sermon was constantly interrupted by a
man near the front with a bad cough. At
last, without staying his eloquence, he drew
from his pocket a tin of throat lozenges and
tossed one to the sufferer, who caught it and
used it with effect. I’m now waiting to hear
of; some enterprising person going to church
afid. making a row like a bad thirst.
“R.S.A.” introduces some cockleshells: —
Walter Marks is to build a 50-ton deep-sea
cruising yacht, costing £7250, and “8.E.” (B.
l/9/’2l) claims that if he crosses the Pacific in it
he will rank with Slocum. This modern 50-tonner
will probably be an auxiliary sehootier or ketch,
strongly bulkheaded into three or four sections.
She will have two or three roomy and well-appointed
staterooms, main saloon, up-to-date galley, bath-room
and toilet, fore-peak and engine-room. A properly-
designed and constructed boat of this type should
be as safe as a P. and O. liner, and Marks would
probably be the last man to’ claim; that a passage
of the Pacific in her would need unusual grit. Cap-
tain Voss sailed the world in a 30ft. Indian canoe
chopped out of a solid log and decked-in. To any-
one who saw the Tilikum, Voss’s boat, and knows
the comfort and seaworthiness of a modern 50-ton
cruiser, a comparison is absurd. Ralph Stock, in his
(Eger, sailed from England across the Atlantic and the
FATHER'S CHANCES.
“I do wish you hadn’t borrowed from
father.”
"Yes, I Know. darling. But I had to. I
was so anxious to get out of debt!”
Pacific; yet in his story he never mentions danger
or hardship or even discomfort; and the (Eger was
about half the tonnage of Walter Marks’s boat.
Recently a par. in The Bulletin announced that two
men had sailed a 10-ton cutter from Suva to Sydney.
They were not showmen. There was the cutter in
Suva, and they wanted to get her to Sydney, so they
sailed her there. Fifty-ton schooners, sans modern
plumbing, water-tight bulkheads, electric-light plants
and so forth are daily sailing the open stretches c'
the Pacific —yes, even 30-tonners and less !

MY GARDEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun has sprung upon us in a day.
His single eye is mellow and benign.
Upon the pane the blowflies roll and play,
And lilting gaily goes this heart of mine.
Fair flow’rs of Spring grow all along the pave.-
Here’s Rose and Myrtle, Violet and May,
Imperious Lilies tall and gracious wave
Their cool, white beauty on the scented way.
Here’s Pansy shy, yet not absurdly so—
Her twinkling eye she would not have you miss;
And Daphne, Heather and Camellia glow,
And will not wither at a little kiss.
My garden beds are set along the Block,
Where bloom the fairest of all flowers of Spring,
And Daisies in their modest colors flock,
And Jasmine casts her scent o’er everything,
And Columbine to please the sense of men,
And Irises so finely catholic.
If I must be denied the bunch, ah, then,
Spring, grant me of thy darling blooms the pick !
VICTORIA.

“Capitaine” : Padre Gault, the author of
“The Stunt Book,” won the A.I.F. cham-
pionship for language not used. After much
effort he got a shift from Tel-el-Kebir to
Europe, so he cleaned up all his Egyptian
affairs, said “Good-bye” and assembled his
belongings on the railway truck. Then,
while he was pacing the platform, awaiting
the departure of the train, a note from
Orderly-room was handed him countermand-
ing his move, and ordering him to report
back. It was the sort of thing calculated to
inspire any man in khaki to a flow of the
best, guaranteed to make Cleopatra and all
the Ptolemies turn in their sleep. The
padre gazed fixedly at the note for several
seconds, then opened his mouth and gave
vent to his overwrought feelings with: “How
extraordinary!”
* * * *
“Aloysius”: “Pip’s” Digger M.A. (B.
l/8/’2l), who was so incurably dirty that
his O.C. had to arrange for his forcible bath-
ing, calls to mind a visit I paid to Mena
Camp in T 5. As a friend showed me round
we came to that part where the wash-houses,
lavatories, etc., were, and here we noticed
a particularly frowsy Billjim on duty. “He’s
rough,” I said to my mate. “He is,” was the
reply. “Guess what he is in civvy life? A
parson—B.A. and all that. He’s come -to do
his bit, but he’s so untidy that so’s he won’t
be an eyesore, to the regiment the Old Man’s
appointed- him permanent sanitary picket.”
The worst offenders in respect of personal
cleanliness among my own lot were
men of education and position. In
private life they would almost have
fainted at the thought of having a
speck of dust on their collar, but in the
Army, as ordinary Diggers without any sense
of responsibility, they seemed to slough the
habits of their former status and showed
that cleanliness can be as much a matter of
convention as of conviction.
THE JOY ’BUS.
“Pretty fast, isn't she?"
“Oh, fairly. Keeps about six months ahead
of my income.”
“J.G.”: I’ve been chary about circum-
stantial evidence ever since I saw what hap-
pened on the Hastings (N.S.W. j some years
ago. A violent row took place between a
Pair of sleeper-cutters who were, working
as mates in a camp there. The, unpleasant-
ness was continued next morning, when
Harry declared he would send Jack.to Hell
as soon as they got to work in the bush.
During that afternoon Jack upended a billet
of wood and tossed it oiit of his way. A
3 sin. broadaxe was lying across another
billet, and Jack’s piece fell on the end of
the handle. The big axe flew into the air,
and in descending cut the rim of Jack’s
felt hat, missing his head by less than half
an inch, and then carved through his boot,
almost cutting his right big toe off. Harry
shouted to some of the other timber workers
to give a hand, and they got Jack to a doc-
SAME START.
THE HOST: “Yes, I started life as a hare-footed boy."
BORED GUEST: “Well, I wasn't horn with shoes or stockings either."
tor. He explained to the rest of the men
how the accident happened ; but what would
have been Harry’s chance had the axe
sliced Jack’s head in two, as it could easily
have done? In view of the threats a clearer
case of murder would be hard to find.
“Percy Pawnticket”: A man who could
wrest consolation from disaster recently
turned up at a Sydney Court. He was of
respectable appearance, said he was a clerk,
and had no excuse but hilarity to offer for
a jag that had been seasoned with riotous
behavior and assault. He was given the
option of a fine or two weeks. “I think I
might as well go to gaol, y’ Worship,” he
remarked cheerfully; “I’ve got a coupler
weeks’ holiday, an’ I’d only have to spend
them at home.” And with a bland smile he
handed himself over to the waiting John
Hops.
“Adrian” : Jones’s humpy in our cow dis-
trict caught fire while Jones was away, and
Mrs. Jones and the little Jonahs fought like
fury and saved the stacks and outbuildings.
When Jones returned the first thing he said
was, “Did yer save any of ther papers?”
Mrs. J. in triumph handed him a piece of
wire strung with receipts, bills, etc. Jones
glanced hurriedly through them and turned
green. “Tain’t ’ere,” he gasped. Still more
triumphant, Mrs. J. dived her hand into
her blouse. “’Ere y’are,” she chortled: “I
knew all the time what you was looking
for,” and planked down the marriage cer-
tificate. Jones nearly hit the roof. “T’ ’ell
with yer marriage lines, woman.” he yelled.
“Where the devil’s the bull’s pedigree?”
“S.S.”: It is not true that our Melbourne
constabulary are always lacking in initiative.
“Police intelligence” is not entirely a mis-
nomer. Take the case of Dunning, who was
held up in a city street recently by a woman
who belonged to a. previous state of exis-
tence—a time before marriage when Dun-
ning was not as good as gold. The lady was
warmly abusive. She had taken hold of
her former “friend,” and was telling him all
about himself in choice idiom. Furthermpre,
she swore never to part with the blighter of
her young life. It was here the large, im-
pressive P.C. intervened. lie took Dunning
by the arm. “Here, come along, I want
you,” he said. He broke the woman away.
“Leave this man to me,” said he; “I have "a
serious charge agin him.” He led Dunning
off, leaving the woman amazed. “Constable,
you are making a mistake,” protested Dun-
ning. Round the corner the P.C. stopped,
and turned a luminous wink on his prisoner.
“Devil a bit of a mistook,” said he. “There,
my mon, you’re shot of her. What’s it
worth ?”
* * * *
“Moe” : The staff of a Vic. country hospital
recently received a shock when a 14-year-old
girl was brought in by her parents from some
out-of-the-way spot to have the cause of her
ill-health diagnosed. The slightest of exam-
inations revealed that the young lady was
about to qualify for the bonus provided in
such cases. It was then the staff got its
shock. She not only didn’t know what was
the matter with her, but didn’t have the
faintest inkling of what writers of family
medical publications call “the mysteries of
life.” Cross-examination of her parents
elicited that the child was speaking the
truth, both mother and father being rather
proud that they “’ad brought ’ey up that
way.” Both were slightly stunned when
the news was broken to them, and as they
declined the task the matron and one of the
sisters withdrew with the victim of igno-
rance and after a trying half-hour succeeded
in making things clear to her. The whole
thing makes a startling object-lesson to
those parents whose ideas of ignorance and
innocence are somewhat tangled.
> * * * *
“Wodgil”: I have forgotten the name of
the gentleman who morosely reproved me
for referring in hostile terms to “the aspirin
habit,” but he couldn’t have been a delegate
to the Public Health Conference in Mel-
bourne. If he had been the Adelaide doctor
who declared that “the medical men of South
Aus. were disturbed at the growth of the
aspirin habit” wouldn’t have escaped, as
he did, unharmed. Neither would the lady
who remarked that “she knew some city
offices where clerks [presumably of the
bloused and skirted variety] kept aspirin in
their desks, and distributed it without re-
striction.” have gone unrebuked. One of
the perils .. incidental to hogging these insi-
dious pellets is that the silly victim may fly
trom aspirin to more dangerous drugs.
Apropos, a Macquarie-street doctor has just
stated that the cocaine disease is on the in-
crease, “having apparently bean introduced
from America by the low-class theatrical
artiste’ and jazz exponent.” These degen-
erates should be added to the list of prohi-
bited imports. The loafer who gets his liv-
ing by exploiting nigger-dances —dances
which are merely an expression of
the swinish sensuality that has kept Sambo
down for thousands of years—is an undesir-
able immigrant, anyhow. When he happens
to be a “coke” fiend in addition, he is not
fit to cumber the earth, let alone a clean,
white Commonwealth.
* * * *
“Zero”: A Digger in Bailleul one day got
stung on the neck by a wasp. He blew into
a Froggie chemist’s and asked for some lotion
to apply to the sting, but the only answer
he could get, whichever way he put it, was
“No compree.” “Spare me days,” he burst
forth at last, “don’t yer jerry? Lotion—
sting—wasp ! Here, look” —illustrating
with his hand—“Ssss—ssp!” That fetched
the Frenchman. “Ah, oui, oui! Compree—
aeroplane !”
* * * *
“1.D.”: I know a man who for about
40 years drank as he listed and then began
to lead a sober life. After he had kept it
up seven years I thought it was time to
get his testimony. “At what stage did the
inclination for drink desert you?” I asked
him. Placing a hand on my shoulder, he
looked sadly into iny eyes and shook his
head. “At no stage,” said he. “It never
leaves you. It is always with me. To-day
the thought of a nobbier of rum has to be
fought down as fiercely as five years ago.
But somewhere, somehow, I have acquired
the will to battle, that is all. If I lost
that I would be up to my neck in the nearest
hogshead in 10 minutes from now.”
*r * * *
“Itiom”: Some gravestones have queer
trimmings. One in the Albury (N.S.W.)
cemetery has the photo of the departed in
evening dress let into the stone ; another at
Point Clare (N.S.W.) has the epitaph writ-
ten in Pitman’s shorthand.
“X.0.C.”: Re the Battle of the Wazzir.
“Spare Corp’s” (B. l/9/’2l) Four Apostles’
crusade may be dismissed as a pleasant fic-
tion. As one early on the scene, I can
vouch for it that Fatma had overvalued her
tainted charms, to the violently-expressed dis-
gust of a Maori]ander, who, on being forcibly
ejected from the dive by a gigantic Nubian
bully, demanded that the boys in the vicinity
avenge , the insult. But the First Divvy
needed no excuse for trouble that bad Good
Friday : the Diggers were just full of Egypt
and things in general, and were suffering
the pangs of disillusionment. Stale with
over-training, enthusiasm diminished by pro-
longed deferment of their share of the fight-
ing, chafing under innumerable snob-inspired
regulations originally devised for the more
docile Tommy, repressed in camp by moralis-
ing old maids, censured at home by relatives
misled by such phrases as “Six-bob-a-day
syphilitic tourists”—what was the logical
result? The spark that set the Wazzir
ablaze could as easily have been struck in a
mosque as a brothel. If, as I believe, the
First intended to convey a hint that it had
sojourned in Egypt too long, the authorities
were remarkably quick in the uptake, for
within a few hours of the disturbance we had
struck Mena Camp and embarked at Alex-
andria for the Great Adventure.
THE HAVES AAD THE HAVEN'TS.
JONES: “We are coming oner to see you to-
night, old man."
SMITH: “Good, hut don't let your wife wear
her new costume. I don't want mine
to sec it just now."
JONES: “Good Heavens, that’s the very
reason we are coming!"
BEWITCHED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To her the day serenely bright
Was just a day of days,
The river flashing in the light,
The mountains blue with haze.
The tinkling oars that dipped in rhyme,
The rocking, swaying boat
Were nought to her' in after-time
But just a day afloat.
She sorrowed not when day was done,
And sunset’s glory flamed,
And held the love so lightly won,
A right her beauty claimed.
For him the hours had golden wings
That sped o’er wave and grass;
Ihe stream a royal road for kings,
Where only two might pass.
He worshipped her as one apart,
An angel in her place,
Nor dreamed that neither soul nor heart
Could match her faultless face.
The sunset died in gold and grey
Above their tiny craft,
And in the dusk, from overhead,
The gods looked down and laughed.

“ YV yrradulla” : Tell ‘*5S8” not to adopt
“Bitter! End’s” (B. l/9/’21) pommy method of con-
' erting lambs’ tails into food. Here is the real
Australian style frequently used' on western runs.
Pick out the largest and fattest tails. Then light
a fire, either in the open or in the fireplace. Wait
until the fire lias burned down to embersj-; then
throw on the selected tails without removing the
skins. After three or four minutes’ roasting they
will be done. The charred skin can then be readily
removed with light pressure of the fingers, leaving
a beautiful, clean, white-fleshed tail. Serve with
salt and pepper, and when “0S8” has cleaned No. 1
plate I’ll bet he backs up for a re fill.
ANOTHER OF THESE SILLY WOMEN.
“Is your mother in?”
“You bet she is. Do you think I’d be work-
ing in the garden on Saturday afternoon
if she wasn’t?”
“Mirridong”: In reply to “Quey” (B.
1/9 / ’ 21) “Cowal” in blac-kfellow means “swamp”
and “Warrambool” a watercourse. The native name
Wambool, given to the Macquarie River, is probably
the same word as “Warrambool.” Other abo. words
are used as river names: “Paroo,” flesh; “Warrego,”
eagle; “Namoi,” a woman’s breast; “Barw'on,”
great, wide; “Bogan,” swamp rushes; “Wakool,”
muddy water ; “Yanko,” hurt; “C’ulgoa,” running
through; “Murrumbidgee,” plenty water. “Billa-
bong” is a dry creek; “Boganbong” a dry swamp;
“Gundablui” a tough tree; “Menindee” yolk of an
egg; “Walgett” a high hill ; “Milparinka” all is
forgiven, and “Narran” lizard.
“Silas” : Wells was showing me over his
holding at Brookside, pointing out its many ad-
vantages, its two fine “cricks,” its abundance of
timber, etc. “I’m fencin’ along here,” he said;
“that’s Carter’s land.” Here Carter hailed us from
his side. “How do you do, Wells?” he said; “I
was wanting to see you. You’re doing a bit of
fencing, I see. Well, if you’ll lend me your draught
horse for three days for my ploughing you can have
that stack of rails lying on my land down by the
creek.” “Oh, all right,” said Wells, reluctantly.
Then, when Carter had passed well out of hearing,
“There’s a low, mean hound, if you like,” he said;
“he knows darned well I was pinchin’ those rails,
anyway.”
"Dido”: This tale must have originated
in the vicinity of the Federal capital, I fancy. The
native was -walking the interested visitor over the
country, showing him the lions and the rabbits
and what not, when they came to a streamlet.
There was a trickle of water over the stones, but
not sufficient to prevent a wood-grub crossing. “I
suppose there is plenty of water running here in
the wet season?” said the visitor. “Plenty of water
in the wet season!” snorted the native. “Why,
dammit all, man, the river is in flood now!”
“H.Y.E.”: For the four most beautiful
of Australian parrots I plump for the green leek
(superb parrot), the mallee and Alexandra parrots,
and the yellow parrot or “Murray smoker.” All.
except the mallee parrot, are rare. The color of
the green leek is bluish-green relieved with rich yel-
low and scarlet; of the mallee parrot rich green
diversified with yellow, red, grey, orange and blue ;
of the Alexandra parrot—a rare Westralian species
—pale green with delicate timings of pale blue and
coral pink.; and of the Murray smoker, pale lemon-
yellow with sky-blue wing coverts. Baldwin Spen-
cer found the Alexandra parrpt at home in remote
parts of W.A., where the abos. knew it as miltung,
meaning, I think, long tail. I have met one flock
of about a dozen green leeks crossing an open space
in a South Coast (N.S.W.) forest, while single
examples of the yellowy parrot A turn up occasionally
on Monaro highlands, somewhat out of their latitude,
and consorting with rqsella#. At first sight these
wanderers were mistaken for albino rosellas.
“Te Whare”: As a rule after he has
selected a camp the diamond-snake doesn’t move
about much, hut I came across one which had two
abodes. During the sunny part of the day he coiled
in a hollow on the slope of a hill, descending at
evening to a gully below and disposing himself in
festoons among the branches of a dead and fallen
tree. I have seen a diamond-snake 30ft. up among
the branches—intent probably on squirrel or
’possum. As a rule, these fellow's travel and obtain
their prey at night, seizing small , birds while asleep ,
on their perches and calling on ’brer rabbit in his
burrow.
* * * *
“7.M.K.”: When we lived on a sugar-
farm on the Lower Burdekin (N.Q.) snakes were
very numerous, and to keep them in
cheek we had cats varying in num-
ber from four to 20. Among them
was a black-and-white mother cat,
who was the killer-in-chief, the
Others doing the r.ounding up. When
one found a snakgfviii, the grass it
by some means let the rest know,
and they would all troop to the spot,
form up - round the wriggler in a
kind of rough semi-circle, and, ad-
vancing with caution, force him into
the open. He rarely tried to strike,
but became very uneasy and anxious
to get away. Once in the open the
cats ringed him completely round;
then the black-and-white mother,
watching carefully, would make her
dash. A lightning grip, close behind
the head, and a shake, and the dis-
abled snake was left wriggling. Then
the others would give vicious smacks
with their paws, and various bites.
Sometimes the reptile would serve
as a meal for the cats; at other
times they would not eat what was
apparently the same kind of snake
as that they had gobbled with relish
a day or so before. If a snake w r as
too big for the pussies to tackle they
always let us know by their peculiar
behavior that there was one about,
and one of us would kill it. Only one
of the cats, as far as we knew, died
of snakebite; but others must have
met the same fate in the long grass and cane,
for often after a night’s hunting some w-ould fail
to answer the roll-call.
* * * *
“Moe”: As “N. Gilbert” remarks (B.
1/9/ 21), Australia possesses in the alkaloid alsto-
nine, obtained from Alstonia ncliolaris and Alstonia
constricta, a specific for -malaria equal to quinine.
The varying potency of the infusion made from
alstonia leaves (it is the .4. scholaris variety which
flourishes in N.Q.) would be due to the fact that
no two infusions would be of exactly the same
strength. But it is the bark of the alstonia-tree
(“dita bark”) and not the leaves that contain the
greatest quantity of the alkaloid. An infusion made
from this part of the tree, therefore, would be much
stronger and would be required to be taken in much
smaller doses than the infusion made from the
leaves. In those Pharmacopoeias in which alstonine
or alstonia are mentioned, it is directed that the
bark shall be used and the alkaloidal salt (alstonine
hydrochloride), the leaves being altogether ignored.
“D.F.” on some forgotten immigrants:—
About the time the camel was acclimatised in
Australia several attempts were made to introduce
its dist'ant South American relatives, the llamas, and
for a time they looked like succeeding. The first to
arrive were four sent out to one Haigh, of Port Lin-
coln (S. Aus.), in March, 1857, by Titus Salt, the
Bradford woollen manufacturer. On Nov. 8, 1858,
NATURAL SC TENGE.
TEACHER: “When water becomes ice, what is the greatest change that takes place !”
PUPIL : “In the price, sir.”
10 belonging to S. A. Lloyd were landed at Sydney
and sent on to Brisbane. On Nov.. 28 of the same
year Charles Ledger, .who had lived for many years
in Peru and Bolivia, landed at Sydney a shipload of
276 llamas which he had smuggled . out through
Copiapo in . Chile. They wereyleft at Liverpool
while Ledger went down into what' is now the Fed-
eral Capital Territory and on through Mongro to'
look fpr suitable country. It was Ledger who, in
a report to thp Lands Department, first used ..the
term “Australian Cordillera” for the highlands qgthe
Divide. He moved his mob to Arthursleigh, (pear
Nimitybelle, ajjd reckoned that they would do Well
there. In 1861 Whey had increased from 276 to 417.
Ledger reckoned to shear them, once in two years,
and also alleged that they were good ‘eating. One of
them gave 261 b. of w.ool after 21 months' growth.
In a lecture given in London in, 1861 Ledger’s
brother'calculated that in 50 years, at the-same rate
of increase, there would be 9,760,000 llamas in Aus-
tralia and that the wool, at 71b. apiece? and 2s. a
pound, would be worth £6,832,'00'0 .a Veaf. But those
chickens didn’t hatch. The N. S. Wares Government
voted Ledger £15,000 for introducing the creatures,
but he reckoned that it cost him more than that. A
little mob of 19 was brought to Victoria, in 1859 and
had increased to 45 in 1861 ; but they, too, faded
away.
“Bad Australian”: While fishing in a
reach of the King River (Vic.) I noticed a succes-
sion of bubbles rising just beyond a belt of weeds
bordering the stream. I lifted my line, which was
baited with a large white wood-grub, and dropped
it gently alongside the bubbles. The bait was taken
at once and . the line and float were pulled steadily'
straight downwards. I struck and. missed. This
performance was repeated three times, but on the
next attempt I landed, not the turtle or catfish which
the peculiar nature of the bite had led me to expect,
but a full-grown platypus.
■».***
“Pick” : Someone recently complained that
a crawler which, on appearance, ought to have been
a harmless carpet-snake, had nibbled at his dog with
fatal results —to the canine. Very probably the
masquerader was a broadhead,. one of the most
vicious and deadly of Australian reptiles, but very
rare. He could readily be mistaken for a part-
grown carpet. He is fancifully arrayed with a zig-
zag pattern of grey, black and golden scales, the
grey predominating, and when newly robed he pos-
sesses the dandiest coat of all his kind. But the
thin neck and extensive width of jaw, from which
he gets his name, give him an especially evil appear-
ance when he rears his head at the approach of foot-
steps ; and he equals the . tiger in his readiness to
attack. His haunt, generally, is the rush-covered
swamp-areas of the X.SAV. coast.
“Vanikoro” : The distribution of the tiny
fresh-water crab (Ilymenosorna) and the small
shrimp afflicted with the name of Xiphocaris is a
perplexing affair. Both are found in Victoria,- in
Maoriland, on Lord Howe Island and on Norfolk
Island. In Vic. they are in lahd-locked lakes, and
on the isolated Lord Howe and Norfolk islands,
hundreds of miles from anywhere, they disport them-
selves in pools up on the hilltops. If they are
the survivors of a fauna which existed ages ago
when there were land connections between their
present gambolling grounds, then they must have
been around for countless centuries.
“Barcoo”: Re the allotted span of a
breeding ewe inquired for by “Hargo” (B. 25/8/’2T).
In 1910 at Mount Cornish (0.Q.) I assisted at the
weaning of 4180 lambs from their 3960 mothers.
The old girls were the remnant of 16,000 that the
eo. had transferred on to the run to help stock it
with breeders when they converted the historic
cattle-station into a sheep-walk. When transferred
they were nine years old, and in 1910, when they
put up such a good record, they had had their 15th
birthday. As they had been the nucleus of the
.station flocks they were allowed a small paddock
in which to die out quietly. How long the last
lived I don’t know, as I left that season; but I sur-
mise that a number of them went on adding to
the birth-rate for years.
*
* * * *
“Z.”: It is recorded in Nature that at
Caterham in Kent a wild rabbit turned the expect-
ant mother off a dove’s nest and sat on the two
eggs till they hatched. Next year two bantam eggs
were put under the rabbit. She took to them at
once, only leaving the nest to take tucker. Pro-
perly worked out there’s a fortune in this. If
“Hamer” and other experts in rabbit-crossing get
to work they might evolve a general-purpose rab-
bit-fow] which would give eggs, chicken-meat,
feather-boas and felt hats.
* * * *
“Sherry”: A burial performance I wit-
nessed on the Nor’-West (W.A.) Coast in ’l4 had
startling results. As the coffin wouldn’t sink in
the flooded grave an auger was used and holes were
ITS COMPONENT PARTS.
PUZZLED CITY KID : "If the skim-milk goes
in the bucket and the cream goes in the
can, where does the water go?”
bored through the head-end of the coffin. A start
was then made at the foot, but almost at once
there came a noise from inside —and several veils
from the onlookers outside. The coffin was opened,
ar.d the occupant found to be alive. Examination
showed wounds, caused, by the auger, on both the
top of the skull and the sole of one foot.

HARRISON’S KATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I rode from town as the sun went down
To call at Harrison’s farm, .i ’
And gaze once more on his daughter Kate,
As I used to gaze at the sliprail-gate
When youth was ours,
With its songs and flowers,
And its hours and hours of charm.
’Twas many a day since I rode that way,
That track to the glowing west,
And little I knew of their life since then,
For I was one of the tribe of men
Who range and roam
O’er plain and foam
In a restless quest for rest.
The daylight died on the rough hillside,
And night his sables donned,
As hot of heart for a sight of Kate
1 rode to _ Harrison’s sliprail-gate, .
And down the track
From the ridge’s back
To the white-washed house beyond.
Her eyes spoke so in the lamp’s soft glow,
As she stood with heaving breast,
That Heaven seemed mine; and I told her then
That I was done with the tribe of men
Who drift and ride,
Like wind and tide,
In a restless quest for' rest.

From Cape York to the Leeuwin
and across m Maoriland, wherever you travel in Australasia you’ll find
CLEMENTS TONIC imparting relief from insomnia, neurasthenia,
vitality, anoemia and similar ailments. Away back m the days
when John Forrest and Henry Parkes were pioneering CLEMENTS
TONIC had established itself as Australia’s Family Medicine, and still
maintains its popularity. Surely this solid reputation is proof of its
dependability.
Try it. Your nearest chemist or storekeeper sells CLEMENTS TONIC.
“Aragun”: “8.N.J.” (B. 11/8/’2l) wants
to teach his moke that breaking bridles isn’t eti-
quette. “Delhi” suggests half-strangling him, “Mon-
aro s method of torture lasts two days, while
H.J.” would put him to the trouble of erecting a
post strong enough to hold the prad. Here’s the
simple bullocky method. Tie the transgressor up
with a fairly strong bridle, stand behind him with a
bullock-whip just within striking distance, and let
him rip. When he gets a fair strain on give him
the full weight of the lash across the rump. He’ll
spring to attention like a shot, a very surprised and
chastened nag, and without any further treatment
111 guarantee he’ll stand tied on a nest of soldier
ants.
“Dumpling”: Tell “FY7” (B. 11/8/’2l)
that a hawk impaled on the beak of a snipe was
Picked up on the Marshes in Norfolk (Eng.) some
years ago, and both are now in a case in the Nor-
wich Castle museum. The snipe’s beak went in the
breast of the hawk and show's through between the
wings at the back—which certainly looks as if the
breast was what the hawk intended to do his killing
with.
* * * *
“D.F.”: Five Durham cows on Colin
Campbell’s station near Cowra (N.S.W.) are doing
their best to put up a record. They have just had
four sets of twin's and one of triplets, or 11 calves
between them ; all alive and well.
*.* * *
“Soda”: A friend of mine, fishing off
Whangaroa Heads (M.L.) for hapuka (groper) in
40 fathoms of water, was using as a sinker the
weight from a butcher’s steelyard, and he lost this
in the kelp at 11 a.m., slack water. At 5 p.m.,
high water, his mate hauled the sinker aboard: it had
been caught by the eye with one of his hooks. The
same man on that day hauled up three 4ft. sharks
at once on a line that had two hooks only. The third
shark had somehow got a half-hitch securely on his
tail. There is no declaration with this; but the
sinker is here, and so were the sharks for a while.
“Monaro” : No ; “ T.H.A.’s” 81-bushel crop
from a fig-tree (B. l/9/’2l) is not a record, even for
Mooroopna (Vic.). Had he strolled across the river
to Sol Towers’s place, on the sandhill by the railway
line, he’d have been introduced to a bush which in
1910 delivered 109 bushels. And most of it topped
the Melbourne market.
“Te Pana” : Last Sunday, when my heir
asked me for tuppence to put in the box to help
the missionaries in the South Sea Islands, it re-
minded me of a day when Jione Tonga squatted on
my verandah and asked questions. “What kinda
God, Misi Pana, b’long white man? Me like smoke
tabac, and big fella b’long Boston mission he say
spose Tonga man smoke tabac he go Hell. By’m-bye
Misi Blank b’long England mission, he hold big
meeting and say plenty good man he smoke tabac;
he go Heaven all right. I wanta smoke very much ;
I join big-feller English mission. After he finish
LAST TRAM TO BONDI.
CONDUCTOR : “Where do yer want to get
of, mate?”
BILL ( drowsily ) : “Gilgandra.”
talk I walk about beach by Catholic mission: Father
Dash he speak to me: ‘Ai Jione, why you not come
Catholic church?’ I tell him what Boston man he
say; what big feller b’long England mission say.
He laugh too much. Fie say go Hell that way. So
I dunno.”
“Crabtree”: The effect of heredity upon
the production of twins and triplets has been illus-
trated in a remarkable way on a property near
Cowra (N.S.W.). There five Durham cows have
produced 11 calves—four sets of twins and one
set of triplets, and all the new arrivals are healthy
animals. The inheritance of a disposition to unusual
fecundity is sometimes marked in human beings.
THERE WAS NO JOY IN THOMAS.
"Why did you break it off with Tom?”
“His handwriting was so awful I was ashamed to show his love letters to the other
girls.”
There is a woman in Sydney who, though not a
twin herself, is the sister of twins. In the fami-
lies of her mother, her grandmother and her great-
grandmother there had been one set of twins. Three
of her daughters have married, and each of them
has one set of twin children in her flock. The son
also is the proud parent of a pigeon pair, although
the woman he married belongs to a family which
can’t recall any previous multiple birth.
“Sassafras” : There has been a lot of skite
about the bags of spuds dug in a day, but no men-
tion of how they are brought from the potato patch
to the barn. Well, here’s one. A draught stallion
hauled 75 bags of taters six chains across ploughed
ground ; total weight of waggon and load, five tons ;
locality, Meershaum Vale, Richmond River (N.S.W.).
“Ferdie”: A tip from a bush-bred N.Q.
girl. When stung on the right forearm arid hand by
a stinging-tree she placed the member in the camp-
fire flames for a few seconds and had no further
trouble.
“ Jackerooster”: I can back up “Nor’-
West” (B. 18/8/’2l) in the cat-rabbit
controversy. In the Deniliquin (N.S.W.)
district cats and rabbits were to be
found in abundance in the year 1917.
and Thomas generally resided in a rabbit
warren. Although I was always on the
lookout I never met a hybrid. In the
sandhill country, where the rabbits were
particularly thick, I frequently saw a
Thomas engaged in a fight to the death
with a bunny, and have watched him
making a meal off his unfortunate
antagonist. Certainly there were colored
rabbits galore that year—sandy, smoke-
color, or blue, black, and, occasionally,
pure whites—but they were rabbits from
nose to scut, although they had Thomas's
body markings. Moreover,' they lived on
herbs exclusively, not on mice, as
“5906’5” alleged hybrids did, although
the mouse plague was at its height in
1917 in Biverina.
“C.G.8.”: If “B.N. J.” wants a horse
with a dislocated neck let him take “Monaro’s”
advice (B. l/9/’2l) and strengthen the rope with
wire. Mac, our five-year-old colt was tied up in
his stall tor his midday feed with a new 3in. rope.
We reckoned the rope would hold. It did, but
Mac’s neck didn’t. He still works with his head
on one side in the plough team, but, of course, is
unsaleable. Also, he steps off with his off hind foot
first, which he usually manages to put over the
trace-chain —-blast him !
“Claroyamo”: A cow in the Fairview herd,
Woodford Dale, Clarence River (N.S.W.), milked
for nine years and provided an annual poddy. For
the most of this time her yield was well over four
gallons daily on ordinary pasture. All attempts
to dry her off and turn her out for a spell failed
except the last one, and that brought on milk-
fevef.
Kentia ’: Australasia has already a dis-
respectable list of extinct birds. There’s the Mac-
quarie Island parrot, the Maoriland quail, the Tas-
manian and King Island varieties of emu, the
night-parrot of S. Aus., and the alba of Lord Howe
Island. The only evidence left that the last ever
existed, apart from a few records of slaughter
jotted down by visitors, is a single skin in the
Vienna Museum. It was a flightless bird 'about
the size of a back-yard hen, white, with a scarlet
bill, ,and once very plentiful. Unluckily for itself
it was good to eat, and as it couldn’t fly the intro-
duced cats and pigs made meals of what the sea-
farers left. There’s a somewhat similar bird, also
flightless, in New Caledonia, the cagou. But we
don’t have a monopoly of massacre of all things
rare and beautiful, for the cagou of the French
colony is nearly wiped out, too,
* * * *
“Wandering Wattle”: There’s a sheep-
farm in Hawkes Bay (M.L.) called “Taumatawha-
katangihaugahoauau.” The nearest you can get to
it in plain Australian is “Musical Peak.” It sounds
like a fair-sized anthem, anyhow. Can anything in
Australia beat it?
*.* * *
‘J.C.S.”: Can any Abo. tell me why a
dog rushes to the nearest waterhole and then vomits
after killing a bandicoot? Every dog I’ve seen kill
a ’coot has always done it.
“Dunederrat”: As there is still a short-
age of building material, here are a couple of ideas
that might come in handy. I know a house built
of beer bottles. First there’s a layer of mud and
straw, then a double row of bottles, placed so that
the necks are side by side, then another row of
mud and straw and so on. It makes a very strong
wall, and only the bottoms of the bottles are show-
ing. Thdn a humpy not far from here is roofed
with weekly papers laid on and nailed as ordinary
shingles. A coat of tar over all made it weather-
proof. It’s been up for 20 years or more, and is
still in good order.
* * * *
Tc* Whare”: I’ve met the black snake
up aloft three times, after birds* eggs or nestlings,
but I doubted the climbing powers of the brown
snake (Diemena tetitilis) until recently, when, on
Monaio (N.S.W.) highlands, a large one was caught
coiled around a blue wren’s nest built in sucker s grow-
ing out of a live stump. It has also been proved
that the tiger-snake goes birdnesting occasionally;
fcut the black devil is the boss climber among our
deadly varieties.
* * * *
Quandary” : What is the quaintest nick-
name for a place in Australia? My duly selected
and endorsed candidate is Barellan (N.S.W.), known
to all the ungodly of the district as Naked Nell.
“J.G.”: Tell “J.H.A.” (B. l/9/’2l) that
the pear-tree which filled 42 cases didn’t put up a
record. About 30 years ago we had a winter
pear-tiee at Buninyong (Vic.) which one year
yielded 51 cases, and the next year 60-odd bushel-
cases. Generally, if a tree produces a heavy crop
one year it yields next to nothing the following
season; but ours wasn’t that sort.
* * * *
“Aloysius”; My mate Bill has just called
out from the other side of the tent to ask me if
the small legged snake that abounds in certain
parts of the Mallee (Yic.) is venomous. Snow
reckons that because the little crawler has legs of
a kind it is not a snake but a lizard, and lizards
are not venomous. Bill, however, is not satisfied,
and suggests asking the Abo. Council, which 1
hereby do.
P-S. —I suggest that Abo.-liars do not delay in
replying. Bill just tells me that his curiosity
springs from the fact that just before knock-off
this .evening he shook a couple of these reptiles
out of his trouser-leg, and remembers it now that
his calf feels sore and itchy.
P.P.S.—On second thoughts there is no hurry
for an answer, that is, as far as Snow and 1 are
concerned. We are watching Bill and expect to
know one way or the other before the night is out.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: “Te Whare” (B. l/9/’2l)
is not far wrong when he says most birds build a
fresh nest each .season; but I have known dozens
of instances of the same nest being used to .hatch
many broods. For three years in succession air
of magpies kept house in a tree in the public-school
grounds at Cobargo (N.S.AV.), without ‘troubling even
to renovate the original nest; and I can show “Te
Whare” an overhanging rock on the Upper Hawkes-
bury (N.S.AV.), where a colony of swallows has
summered, to my knowledge, for the last 25 years.
Also I can point out hundreds of places where birds
which build in hollow trees have used the same
hollow for years. “Te AA r hare,’’ also says birds, when
robbed, seldom lay again jii the same nest. My
experience is that, excepting very shy ones like the
lyre-bird, all will lay .in a nest that has been robbed,
provided the villa itself has’ not been injured.
* » * *
“Jimsey” : In the days of the gold rushes,
when they first came into almost general use, our
present-day “bowyangsb were known as “towyangs.”
They seem to have gradually evolved into “bow-
yangs” ; but why?
“Jim Carew”: In some Western N.S.W.
tribes Binghi had a quedr way of making his dog
faithful. When he first got the mong. he took
several hairs from his own chest and armpit, cut
them up into tiny pieces and mixed them with the
dog’s food. Once the dog had eaten these, Binghi
firmly believed that no power on earth could break
his allegiance. As it happened, Binghi very rarely
had to complain of canine faithlessness, and he
wasn’t a gentle master either.
TOO AMBITIOUS.
“Why are you always quarrelling with your
wife, Jacky?"
“She too plurry flash! Every time parson
come round she want to get married."
“Aussieite”: The other day I found a hen
dead in the nest and an egg about five inches long
and two in diameter near her. I broke the egg
and found inside an ordinary-sized egg and about
a teacup-full of watery fluid. Inside the second
egg were four yolks but no “white.”
“Hum”: At the recent Albury (N.S.W.)
show one of the competitions was entitled “What
a Capable Woman Can Do.” There were several
entries, and one lady included in her exhibit a
dozen eggs.
THE INVESTIGATION OP THE PLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
• Acting-Prime Minister rays the Government
intends to continue its investigations of the blow-
fly- —Daily paper.
In considering the fly
There are many things to note:
When the temperature is high
You can see its evil bloat;
You can guess its fell intent
By its heavy, wary drone—•
There’s a sound like Parliament
In its tone.
In considering the fly
This you’ll readily observe:

A Plain
Fact!
a farmhouse courtyard. Again, music and
architecture are the strictest and most con-
fined of the secondary arts, which are all
very strict and limited. Schlegel’s strained
phrase throws a decorative light on such
decorative things as Milan Cathedral and
\Vestininster Abbey. There is, too, a strong
echo of “Rule Britannia” in Windsor Castle,
and more than an echo of Spain’s passionate
Arabian song in the red Alhambra at Gra-
nada. But these things are not the whole
of architecture; they are a few definitely
theatrical examples of a generally curiously
misunderstood but very potent art.
Down at essentials there are no “arts,”
primary or secondary. Some color comes
into the lives of old men and babies, of nuns
and field-marshals, of small shopkeepers and
ladies of easy virtue. It comes by way of
Speech in love-letters, by way of pictures on
the first-seen bloom of a spring dusk, by
Way of the life in a singing voice or the
sound Of the Wind. These are common things,
like fdod find sleep; But the civilisations
treated a questionable breed called artists
who specialised in these ordinary things,
and gave them frightening, isolating names.
The color was lifted to the dignity of “imag-
ination,” far above mere birth and death.
For the correct dispensing of imagination
the citizens looked to tin l artists, who more
and more withdrew their mysterious occupa-
tions from the people’s knowledge. Until
to-day, when a thousand arts supply us with
"food for the soul.” There are musics ring-
ing half understood in our ears; pictures
hanging half understood on our walls. Let-
ters —the daily speech of man and man—is
a deep mystery of the elect, up to its ears in
an iron technique; and architecture, God
help us, is “frozen music.”
A man building himself a home is an
architect. He is not scared to death, it is
true, of “balanced proportions,” “correct
style,” "traditional design,” etc., bat in effect
he is a truer architect than the Greek Chief
Fabricator, the Arcliitecton, who began the
business. He is thinking all the time in the
simplest terms of the expression of the
surroundings of his family, solidifying, as it
were, domestic color for himself and his chil-
dren. Not in any. way an expert, he yet
expresses more fully than the impersonal
expert all that he wishes: comfort, quietude,
apt and confident lines, the lights and shad-
ows of his personal thought showing natu-
rally in the house’s spiritual and temporal
content. The house must be personal, like
the owner’s stomach or his soul. So his
fellowmen built, before Art was invented, all
the cities, their straight or winding streets,
their public buildings, temples, and so forth.
That Greek who appeared when things began
to get definite names was still only the chie_f
fabricator, the boss of the structural busi-
ness ; the color and lines, the architecture of
the structure did not need an expert.
The artists who came later, putting a ring y
fence round the technique of their incomes,
were not any more architects than the
earlier builders; they only said they were.
The fighting republics grew into lazy mon-
archies and empires, grew rich and slack-
ened their grip on first-principle things like
the home and its personal lights and shadows.
The artists kept on repeating that they were
architects, and the bloated minds of the
empires kept on losing their nerve and get-
ting richer and richer. Finally, unable to
stand the steady reiteration any longer, they
put all building matters into the hands of the
architects. These promptly flooded the busi-
ness with thousands of hitherto unknown
words and ideas so as to lock up their
capital and to mystify any baron or patri-
cian who had the cheek to meddle with his
own home or what it looked like.
To date, looking at the thing from the
ordinary inexpert angle, the thousands of
words and ideas seem to form a great part
of what is to hand after some centuries of
not interfering in our own affairs. Left alone,
a farm-house courtyard still looks like its
pre-artistic, workaday, inspiring self instead
of a tricked-out Elizabethan glebe-land. The
fierce heart of Arabian Spain left alone
would still glower, technically unimproved
and more obvious, from Granada’s hill. The
happy;, inartistic piety which shot up into
the pinnacles of Milan in the 14th century
was not invented by the fabricators who saw
that the pinnacles didn’t fall down. Henry
111. and Henry VII. were the architects of
Westminster Abbey, with various carving
and masonry foremen under them. And no
artist put that regrettably loud note into
Windsor; the gloomy, stolid defiance is
national, grown out of a million homes built
with half an eye on color and one and a half
on a menacing sea. So, in spite of the tin-
kering artists, the great building stands on
Thames-side expressing “Rule Britannia”
and little else —expressing it as strongly as
Britannia’s history or her physique or her
speech.
Hence if the argument hangs together
architecture is no frozen mystery, but the
truest and simplest of the color-mediums. Its
rigid subordination to use (how much will
carry how much, what will lean safely on
what, and so on) forces it into the simplicity
which the other more decorative mediums
have lost. You and I know as much of it
as the longest-haired, biggest-tied theorist in
Sydney or in Athens. Only we think we
don’t; the theorists have seen to that. I am
afraid to build a house for myself and my
people; at the bottom of my heart I know
that I could, but I am scared that I shall
make a mess of this mysterious business of
building my home. So I must go to an
architect not because he will build me the
house I want, but because the house will be
what the artist-tradition says I ought to
want. I shall he satisfied, of course; sfiak-
s h Qe s I shall probably tell him that
Schlegel says his art is “frozen music.” But
1 shall be a coward and a liar thereby, and
oa r to boot. Our fireplaces and win-
dows, the lines and color of our sheltering
walls, are my "art,” and I ought to get my
coat oft' and start the job.
HILAHY LOFTING.
The Poet of the Kerb
With the passing of the late lamented
William Butters the field for penny-a-copy
poetry in Sydney is left entirely to P. F.
Collins. As a matter of fact, the poet, like
Most other people, feels the effect of H.C.L.,
aiid tries tipoh occasion to sell his wares
at "tuppence d time” ; but a man of native
generosity he is prepared to let his gems
go to patrons of tlife 31 Use for the lesser
sum rather than allow them to miss the
educating influence of his verse.. It is the
same large philanthropy which impels him
to give, for nothing, long recitations of
rhyme when on the track of business; as,
for instance: “Buy a verse on Paddy
Quinn; you’ll buy more if you begin. It
will only cost a penny ; come and buy one
if you’ve any. Patronise a poet’s verse:
you might spend your money worse.”
Collins is a topical poet of the first order :
few events of big note occur without the
printing press having to get going with a
new masterpiece. There is a simple direct-
ness about him; and he takes pains to make
himself clear to all men. For instance,
after mentioning in eight lines that he is
writing about the loss of the men in the
Fitzroy find Our Jack, he repeats, in case
anyone should misunderstand him:—
1 mean all those who lost their lives,
Many of them we know well,
And How they felt when choked with brine
No mortal man can tell.
©ie, last two lines show that he is not afraid
td deal with hotTOi’S. Yet is his muse mel-
lowed b.t fi bright philosophy l
But this sad loss cannot be helped ;
Some day we all must die.
But we would like before we go
To bid good friends good-bye.
Perhaps his greatest claim to fame, how-
ever, Is his discovery of an adequate, and
soul-satisfying rhyme for “poets,” revealed in
the achievement which he calls “Paddy
Quinn” :
He’s a man who is witty,
If he’s poor it’s a pity,
He can write a ditty
With the best of our poets;
He hates all the wowsers
Who wear funny trousers,
He’d rather feed towsers
Than those silly goats.
The analogy between the words was dis-
covered previously by a suburban parson
who acted as editor of a Sydney church
magazine. In one issue he found it neces-
sary to apologise for an error in its pre-
decessor. “Owing to a printer’s error,” he
explained, “an article in our last issue was
headed ‘The Goats of Australia.’ It should
have been, of course, ‘The Poets of Aus-
tralia’; hut the error was only a slight
one.” Collins was, after all, though, the
first man to discover that the two words
rhyme-.
HAMER.
A Satchel of Books
Fortune’s Wheel, by Morice Gerard (Geo. Robert-
son and Go., Ltd.), fells of an admirable young
engineer who Invents a machine worth £lOO,OOO.
wins the love of his employer’s daughter, and
inherits a baronetcy and estate—all by the time he
is 22. The characters are a wooden lot, but the plot
has plenty of incident.
The Man on the Other Side, by Ada Barnett (Geo.
Allen and Unwin, Ltd.), A novel of the transmigra-
tion of souls. As a result of tile working of some
spiritual principle by which hate is drawn to hate
a patriotic Englishwoman acquires the soul of Karl
von Sehade, who has died, minus two legs and one
arm, cursing the British during the war. The eerie
subject is brilliantly handled.
The House with the Golden Windows, by J. E.
Buckrose (Hodder and Stoughton). Readable novel
of English middle-class life, dealing with the for-
tunes (and misfortunes) of an adopted girl. The
characters move and talk like real men and women,
and there are some capital descriptive passages. Good
second-class matter.
That Pretty Little liorsebreaker, by Mrs. Edward
Kennard (Oldham’s, Ltd., per George Robertson).
Squire’s daughter loses her father and her fortune,
takes a job showing off ’osses, and marries Lord
Algy in the last chapter. Commonplace yarn, but
the lady writes about ’osses and fox-hunts with real
enthusiasm.
The Masked Woman, by Johnston McCulley (Watt
and Co., via Whitcombe and Tombs). Adventures of
a New York professor who turns criminal and falls
in with a mysterious female. Clever and absorbing
up to a certain point, but falls away ’ towards the
finish—which is characteristic of U.S. detective
fiction, Poe's always excepted.
Gun-sight Pass, by William MacLeod Raine
(Houghton Mifflin, per Australasian Publishing Co.).
A novel with the familiar Raine types ; neither very
good nor very bad. The rather wooden hero is gaoled
for a murder he didn’t commit ; released on ticket-of-
leave, he is admitted to a. syndicate that strikes oil.
The oil chapters ought to start a new crop of “ex-
perts" in Australia, parts of which are rather mad
about oil at the moment.
Mostly About Trout, by Sir George Aston (George
Allen and Unwin, Ltd.). A charmingly-written col-
lection of essays on fly-fishing—from the Itchen,
which is the dry-fly artist’s Mecca, to Albania,
where they only fish in the intervals of cutting one
another’s throats. The writer did not get as far as
Australia in his half-century’s pursuit of the sport,
but there is an account of a day in the Mooi
in Natal, which suggests that conditions there are
pretty well identical with those in our Monaro
streams.
Defending the Ashes, by P. E. H. Fender (Chap-
man and Hall). This is a business-like account, of
the events between Sept. 18, 1920, when Douglas’s
side left Tilbury Docks, to April 18, 1921, when
the stricken sportsmen arrived home again. No-
thing is extenuated, and nothing set down in malice.
The uproar at Sydney over the cables seems to have
been forgiven, if not forgotten, and the atmosphere
of the book suggests that Australians are fellow-
men, if not exactly English gentlemen. Every
match is exhaustively described, and there are many
excellent photographs. An odd mistake has been
made with one of the latter, by the way: a well-
known aspect of Broken Bay is labelled “On Sydney
Harbor.”
The Indignant Spinsters, by Winifred Boggs (Her-
bert Jenkins). Fairly agreeable yarn of three mildly-
interesting young women who came into money and
pose as members of a country family, changing
their names and renting Rubadub Hall. The wages
of imposition are husbands. There are snatches of
smart dialogue and the colloquial Contraction of “it
is” is spelt without the apostrophe at least a hundred
times. Also, when the miserly uncle dies, leaving
£BOOO in the black box, the girls “take the money
to the bank next morning” (in the England of lady-
novelists there is no Probate Office or Curator of
Intestate Estates), and the handsome capting, killed
by the Germans to the satisfaction of the War Office
and Splurge, the vicar, suddenly returns to earth,
without the miracle being explained. A heedless
creature is lovely woman when she stoops to fiction.
The Inky Way
Lothian’s (Melb.) arc to publish a new volume of
Bernard O’Dowd’s verses shortly.
“Invalid”: In Lieut. Jones's book “The Road to
Endor” he says:—
“To anyone desirous of quitting this mortal coil we
can offer one piece of sound advice —don’t try stran-
gulation. Than hanging by the neck nothing more
agonising can be imagined.”
He and Lieut. Hill, in order to make out that they
were lunatics, pretended to commit suicide in this
manner. In an old edition of Chambers’s Encyclo-
paedia 1 read: —
“It is believed that death [from strangulation]
takes place very rapidly and without causing any
suffering ; the violent convulsions that are so often
observed being similar to those which occur in
epilepsy. A man named Hornshaw, who was on
three occasions resuscitated from hanging—a feat
which he performed in London for the amusement
of the public—stated that he lost his senses almost
at once; and other persons who have been restored
state that all they, experienced were a ringing in
(he ears and a flash of light before the eves, then
darkness and oblivion.”
These conflicting statements leave me puzzled. Per-
haps someone who has been cut down just before
he gave Ids last gasp will clear the matter up.
“Coot”: The Bendigo (Vic.) City Council is trustee
of a memorial to poet William Gay, who died in
1897, and every year the interest oii the memorial
investment is awarded as a orize for an essay. This
year it goes to A. G. Millett, a member of the Aus-
tralian Literature Sociey (Melb.), for a dissertation
on “Rhyme and Rhythm : their effect oil Poetry]"
“Fax”: Adam Lindsay Gordon’s old home, which
the S.A: Government has bought, got its name of
Dingle.v Hell from “Pickwick Papers,” of course.
Mr. Pickwick and friends spent some liapp.v times
at Manor Farm, Dinglev Dell, the home of Mr.
Wardle and the Fat Boy. They were guests there
when they went to see the famous cricket match
between All-Muggleton and Dingley Dell, which ended
in the latter team throwing up the sponge. Luffey
and Struggles were set to bowl alternately against
Dunikins and Podder, who opened the first innings
for All-Muggleton, each bowler being matched
against his particular batsman. And because “when
Dumkins was caught, out, and Podder stumped out,
All-Mtiggleton had notched some 54, while the score
of the Dingley Hellers was as blank as their faces,”
the Dingley Dellers were apparently glad to declare
the match closed in favor of All-Muggleton. From
all which it appears that Dickens’s knowledge of
cricket was not very profound. -
“J.F.H.” (Loud.) : Passed out, the Daily Express,
published in Dublin for 70 years without a break.
The proprietors say they have “decided to discon-
tinue its issue for the present,” but nobody expects
to witness its resurrection. For a long time it flour-
ished as the organ of the Irish Conservatives, but it
subsequently passed into the possession of Sir Horace
Plunkett, who made it the mouthpiece of his Irish
co-operative agricultural movement. Another change
made it the organ of the new Irish literary revival,
with Yeats, Synge, Standish O’Grady, etc., as contri-
butors. Then Lord Ardilaun, a Guinness by birth,
had a turn as proprietor, but he soon got tired of
signing cheques and decided to stick to his brewery.
The defunct paper is said to have been the first, to
publish a wireless news item —it was one transmitted
by Marconi himself.
“D.F.”: Publishing conditions are still bad in the
Cold Country. A Sydney man who had arranged to
have a historical excursus brought out by A. and C.
Black, Ltd., was delayed by illness, lie wrote to
tell them all about it, and this is what he got back:
“Although we regret the cause we are rather relieved
than otherwise to learn that your work is delayed.
The conditions of book production have hardly im-
proved at all since the wav. Perhaps by the time
your MS. arrives they may be better.” •
“S.T.S.”: Col. Philip Trevor, whom Australia
knew as Major when he was manager of an English
XI, takes a .new way of airing his views on the
game, by writing a. novel, ‘‘Smith; Cricket Pro.”
The hero is an aristocratic youth who had enlisted
at 18, worked up to major’s rank, and now, after
the war, finds it impossible to get a job ; so, by the
family influence .and a . display of firework bowling
when on trial, he gets taken on at Lord’s straight
off. instead of “working like a mole for six months”
before getting a hearing there. Smith is hailed as
the first left-hander ever known to bowl googlies,
but the authority instances Llewellyn, the S’Africau.
who played for Hampshire. “Never once!” says a
great batsman, and the sage of 1 the story scores
again: “There happens to be cricket Which is not
first-class. Before the war Llewellyn bowled the left-
hand googly in a match down at Chiswick. Why
didn’t he bowl it when playing- for the county ? Be-
cause he couldn’t keep a length when he did.”
“Herodot”: Australian historical research is
likely to receive a much-needed impetus fronf the
foundation at Melbourne ’Varsity of a Henry Gyles
Turner scholarship for encouraging the study of
our early history. At present there is only one his-
torical research foundation there, that created by
William llarbison, of Brighton, to preserve the
memory of George lfiginbotham, C.J. The plans
for the Turner scholarship include the sensible provi-
sion that it shall not he restricted to graduates or un-
dergraduates ; any person interested in historical re-
search and complying with certain other conditions will
lie eligible to enter. The aim of the committee
that is handling the matter is to gather in suffi-
cient, money to allow of research work being con-
ducted in other countries, and seeing that sources
of Australian history may exist in places so far
apart as London and Batavia, there is much wisdom
in the idea.
“dim C'arew” : An early. Australian hook which as
to scarcity and value ranks with Major Mudie's
“Felonry of New South Wales” is John Lang’s “His-
tory of Botany Bay.” The families that commissioned
a Sydney bookseller to buy up every available copy
of Major Mudie’s hook and then destroyed several
pages in each copy, did the same thing with the
“History of Botany Bay.” The result, is that a
complete copy is a valuable rarity.
They had great ideas of hospitality in Scotland
a hundred years ago. The new life of Walter Scott
tells how, though a really gluttonous feeder, he ate
a light dinner when he . had guests, considering ,'t
his duty to talk to them no less than to feed them.
“A favorite story of his was that of the goldsmith
in Edinburgh who made a fine host, and, when asked
how he managed to attend so well to his guests,
replied that he always had a steak and a pint of
claret half an hour before the g-nests appeared.”
“J.F.IL” (Loud.) : G. B. Burgin, who has turned
out about 60 novels, has now weighed in, with an
autobiography, “Memories of a Clubman.” I He tells
a new yarn about Phil May, with whom he became
acquainted when associated with .T. K. Jerome on
The Idler. Phil had promised certain sketches,
but they failed to turn up, and Jerome wrote him an
angry letter. Phil came into the office next day and
read Jerome’s letter to Burgin, dwelling on such
phrases as “most shuffling and unreliable man in
the world.” Then he took from his portfolio a
“wonderful sketch” showing an enormous-footed
Jerome kicking him out of the office. Passing it to
Burgin, Phil inquired: “Do you think this would
make amends if I were to give it to him?” “You
can try, but it’s a. bit, dangerous.” “Do you like
it?” “Yes,” said Burgin, “it’s ,a very good sketch.”
“So it is,” rejoined Phil. “You’re right. I’m
damned if 1 give a sketch like that to a man who
wrote me such a letter.” And he bolted out of the
office.

the INVESTMENT MERITS of
COMMONWEALTH CABLES, LIMITED
(To be incorporated under N.S.W.- Comiianies Acts 189971907).
“The prospectus is the most straightforward which has been placed before the
public for a' long time, and there are no hungry promoters threatening large bites. For
passing over the contract holus-bolus, and for costs incurred over the contract and the
establishment of the co., 10,000 fully-paid deferred ordinaries are asked—slightly more
than 41 p.c. on the contract price. These shares are not to be eligible for divs. until
the ordinaries subscribed by the public—lso,ooo are offered —have had 10 p.c., but when
the public has had half of its money returned by way of divs. the deferreds will rank
with the other shares.
“To equip the co. to fulfil the P.M.G.’s contract, an outlay of £45,000 on land,
buildings and'plant, etc., is anticipated; and £40,000 more is reckoned as necessary for
working capital, and to . cover preliminary exes. From the initial contract —providing
18 months’ work —a profit of £38,400 is expected. That would give a return of 20 p.c.
p.a. over two years on the £95,000 of paid capital proposed. So that this may not
seem tall talk from the promoters, accountant Alex. Jobson and engineer M. C. Timms
(he has had 22 years with the largest English cable-makers, and is now with the Vic.
Railways) were called in. Both declare that estimates are conservative, Timms adding
that there ‘are no technical difficulties likely to arise to prevent the successful manu-
facture of electrical cables of all kinds in Australia.’ The enterprise deserves support.”
The Financial Editor of the Dai ivy Telegraph comments on the prospectus as
follows ,
“On the prospectus conditions the enterprise appears to be a very sound proposition,
and one of a kind for which the Commonwealth affords abundant scope.”

“Tim Tiki” : You got a touch of profes-
sional pride in every calling. A prisoner
addressing the jury in a case before a M.L.
court recently was explaining liow he came
by certain information. “In my occupation
as a crook, it is my place to know such
things,” he remarked simply.
“Mealticket”: Ananias, the land agent,
was extolling the virtues of the week-end
block we were inspecting (I was the mug)
when a well-dressed stranger came along and
began booming the property himself. To my
astonishment Ananias turned a somersault
and scornfully contradicted him, saying that
the only things it would support were
bracken-fern; land-agents and crab-holes.
When the stranger left Anaidas told me not
to believe any of the nasty things that he
iiad just said. The stranger, he explained,
was the shire valuer.

“Variometer” (B. l/9/’2l) is off the track when

such good work between Melbourne and Hobart
were a legacy from the Navy. They were secured
by the P.M.G. after taking- over. 1 did not claim
that dual reception and remote control are new ideas ;
but it is the first time either have been used in
Australia. Tests under the Navy regime were, in-
variably failures due to Navy interference with
previously satisfactory gear. As a sample of Navy
administration, in spite of the increasing sensitive-
ness of receivers it added to the number of stations
and actually increased the power at several already
existing, thus increasing costs and confusion. The
P.M.G. has already closed two of these superfluous
stations, and more are to go.

A woman who lately appeared in Adelaide
Police Court considers the ex-gamekeeper the
best poacher. Charged with telling fortunes,
she explained that she is so anxious not to
break the law that she had consulted a
former Crown Prosecutor, now in private
practice, and makes all her intending clients
sign a form suggested by him to this effect:
“I understand that Madame X is about to
perform an entertainment for my amuse-
ment. and that she does not profess to fore-
toll the future.” The Court took weeks to
think it over, blit finally decided against it
as “insincerity, a device intended to circum-
vent the law. There is no way in which
fortune-telling may. be done lawfully—-any
more than larceny.” £l5 and costs.
“Morob” from an inside angle:—
“ll.R.’s” story of the lady abortionist who handed
out her business cards to prospective customers (B.
1,/9/’2l) touches only on the fringe of the business-
seeking methods of her profession. One victim re-
cently confided to me in hospital that she had been
stopped in the street by a kindly-spoken and elderly
lady, who offered her services. Another owned up
to having been introduced to the abortionist through
the medium of a select city cafe, the proprietress of
which collected a commission from both parties to
the transaction. Generally the fees charged would
make .'the mouth of an ordinary specialist water, £5O
being by no means uncommon. The harpy’s chief
delight is to strike a ease in the background of
which there is either a married man or a young
fellow who, for various reasons, is unable to marry
the girl. In spite of this, a chief feature of the
whole nasty business is the invariable loyalty of the
victim towards her “benefactress” when things go
wrong. For this reason the police find it hard to
get sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. In
Queensland the Supreme Court Judges, by arrange-
ment among themselves, have a standing tariff of
ten years on a conviction, the result being that in
that State the trade is suffering- a formidable slump.

The shining . “tail” around the dish—black-sanded
gold, or “free” ;
No “finger-roughing” for the slugs that might be
thrown away
Because the drift has coated them with camouflaging
clay ;
No raking of the shovel’s fill with expectation vast —
Don’t tell us all these deeds and dreams are buried
in the past!
No tinkling of the hammers on the anvils night
and day,
When well-worn picks from forges red give out a
spark array ;
No sound of saws that cut the lengths for sluices
quickly made;
No running-up of stores to *stock the wherewithals
of trade;
No .building of the boarding-house, with other things
combined—
Oh, for Romance’s sake, don’t say these joys are
left behind !
No gleaming fires along the lead, no songs and
music quaint
From fiddles and accordeons supplied without
restraint.
No .golden girls who may be “bad” if judged in
other climes ;
■No shanty-keepers who are held washed clean of all
their crimes.
No dreams of rainbows’ ends achieved, nor castles
bnilt in Spain—
Don’t tell us' that these things are gone to come
not back again !

FITTINGS
Build the Perfect Bicycle.
The bicycle built with B.S.A. Fittings is depend-
able, looks good and is cheaper in the long run
than the machine which in first cost is much
less than the B.S.A.
You can compare a bicycle built of genuine
B.S.A. Fittings by every possible test with a
so-called cheap bicycle, and you will readily
understand why a B.S.A. is the cheapest machine
in the end.
Year in and year out this bicycle will give
unfailing service, providing many hours of real
enjoyment because of its easy running and comfort.
The choice of a bicycle built of B.S.A. Fittings is a businesslike decision; the economy,
reliability and freedom from trouble making the purchase of B.S.A. a sound investment
which will never be regretted.
Regular B.S.A. riders say there is nothing to equal the satisfaction which the bicycle
of the 4 ‘Three Piled Rifles” gives.
The range of models and constructional improvements shown in the B.S.A. catalogue
will illustrate why the bicycle built of B.S.A. Fittings is so popular.
TRADE MARKS
B.S.A.
Look for the B.S.A. three piled rifles trade-marks; they
are stamped on the Steering Head, Crank Bracket, Seat-
pillar Lug, Back Fork Ends, Back Fork Bridge, Back
Stay Bridge, Hubs and Pedals.
These trade-marks carry with them a guarantee of long
and reliable service, and are backed by a reputation of
over sixty years’ standing.
TRADEMARKS
B.S.A.
B.S.A. Fittings are Guaranteed Interchangeable.
Exact replacements of any part can be obtained. Don’t
be put off with “pattern fittings,” but look for the B.S.A.
Trade-marks on EVERY PART. They are your guarantee.

Which!—Cough or Consumption ?
When you have a cough it does not mean that you
have consumption, or that you are going to have it,
but it does mean that your lungs are threatened and
it is just as well for you to be on the safe side
and take Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy.

"E.T.”: Speaking of the heat wave in
England (B. l/9/’2l), one afternoon in July
London was favored with a slight shower,
and the audience at the matinde performance
at Oswald Stoll’s Coliseum was informed
of the fact per medium of the cinema screen.
When the announcement was thrown on the
sheet the house gave it more applause than
any turn received during the show.
“8.T.”: I have been complaining of the
high price of mallee-roots in Melbourne, but
got a little of my own back the other day.
When breaking up a large root I found one
of its tentacles curled about, and firmly
grasping, a black metal disc Which proved

ing a lively look out for the other ten bob.
“Ruru”: Apparently there are some who
don’t mind when they reach the end of the
journey. In Point Resolution Cemetery,
Auckland (M.L.), there is a gravestone with
this cheerful epitaph :
Here lies
Ann Sophia Wood,
Died aged 92 years,
“Satisfied,”
No wonder the Defence Department de-
cided ih the end thfit the. Digger hi list tiot

out Official shpctibn. Adelaide Police Cbtift
has just heard a case Against Certain philan-
thropists who ran a firework display, ip
which the exes swallowed £416 of the £524
raised. The philanthropists had no autho-
rity to run .the show, but the S.M. said it
was merely a technical offence and didn’t
even impose a fine.
“S.M.” : At the Moutefiore Home in Mel-
bourne, a haven for ancient and battered
sons of Israel, Isaacson, one of the inmates,
was so feeble that he was expected to fade
out any day. Then somehow the news got
abroad that he had gone, and the Holy
Brotherhood which performs the last rites
upon the dead bodies of Hebrews at once
sent out two officers with all the necessary
impedimenta. A grinning attendant in-
formed Isaacson that they had arrived and
were downstairs preparing for the ceremony.
Isaacson, & Sport till, the last, never turned

“Skipper”: “Howitzer” (B. 8/9/’2l_l
isn’t quite correct about the bogus Aussie
V.C. who became engaged to a Lord Mayor’s
only daughter. He teas tried by District
Court-Martial at Wareham Camp. The
accused was defended by an eminent English
barrister: rumor had it that the Lord
Mayor’s cheque-book provided the refreshers,
and that his daughter clung passionately to
her lover, believing him to be the victim of
a vile practical joke. He was acquitted,
but no wedding bells sounded, for Bogus
backed his luck again. He went A.W.L.
and was arrested in Bournemouth, mas-
querading as an officer in a “borrowed
tunic and Sam Browne belt.
This illuminating epistle was recently re-
ceived by an Australian meat-preserving co.
from Obuasi. West Africa :
Dear Sir, —Liaise be your name, here all oyer

meats known as Corned Beefs to our West Africa.

“Adelaide”: Dr. Ramsay Smith, who,
among otheiy things, is the City Coroner, has
been discussing the psychology of the pedes-
trian in a motoring accident. He wonders
whether the steadily increasing deaths have
occurred in spite of, of in consequence of, the
“safety precautions” that are now being
enforced:—-
To direct attention to the dangerous placet, and to
keep thinking of them or looking at them, is one
of.the surest ways Of causing accidents. The funda-
mental mistake often made in regulating traffic is
the assumption that it is and must be dangerous;
and most of our laws, regulations and material
contrivances ate calculated to arouse in people
a dread of danger, instead of encouraging them to
cultivate a sense of safety.... There should be only
orie distinguishing sound for one thing. Anything
else is a dangerous nuisance.
The doctor adds that the ghastly modern
varieties of motor-horn are the nearest thing
in civilisation to the yell of a murdering
savage. So primeval racial instincts come
out at the sound of it: the victim feels that
he (or she) must jump for safety— and as
often as not jumps straight into danger.
“T. 0.1. ”: A N. S. Wales Railway Guide
published just on 50 years ago gives several
illustrations of the mountain homes of not-
able Sydney men. At' Springwood Charles
Moore, one-time Sydney’s Mayor, after
whom Moofe Park is named, had a fine estate
of 30 acres with a substantial cottage which
still stands, though the land has long since
been cut up and sold in allotments. At “The
Valley,” now Valley Heights. Geoffrey Eagar,
one-time Colonial Treasurer, had a cottage.
Wyoming. It also is still standing, though
built by one Fraser 90 years ago. Its ori-
ginal purpose was that of an inn, and for
years it held a license. Next came Faulcon-
bridge, Henry Parkes’s cottage, which stood
in about 400 acres of mountain bush. It
has now disappeared. At the cottage Parkes
entertained George and his brother Albert
when they visited Australia as princes, lhey
both planted trees; and although George s
has withered, that planted by his elder
brother (dead), now flourishes in someone s
back yard. Next was Alfred Stephen s
weatherboard cottage, close by James Mar-
tin’s Numantia, both now wiped out. -Mar-
tin was the first to buy Crown lands on
the mountains. His purchase ran into hun-
dreds of acres, but all of it passed out_of his
hands before his death. He spent £oooo on
the foundations of a huge mansion, but it
never got beyond that, and the masonry has
since provided material for a modern. villa
near the spot.

American Flashlights
AMERICAN Flashlights have
- many improvements, which
make them superior to all other
lashlights. Among them are:—
Dual Contact —
permitting either a flash or con*
tinuous light.
Non-short-circuiting case —
insuring long battery life.
Shock absorber —
to prevent breakage from drop*
ping.
No movable parts —
to get cut of place and cause
damage.
American Flashlight Batteries, too,
give greater satisfaction—they last
longer and give a brighter light.

As a consolation prize D. 'H. Gibson, who
lost his seat at Grenville to Hughes (Labor),
has been nominated by the Vic. Hayseed
Party Conference at Geelong for the board
of control of the voluntary wheat pool. Hill,
M.H.R., who has his £lOOO a year anyhow,
and H. W. Pickering were selected as the
oilier two.
“Te Panu”: Hori and his people have
increased by 2770 since the last official
count in 1910. If that progress represented
pure-blooded stock only, then within another
10 years the Maori population should regain
the 56,049 shown in INSK. The latest figures,
however, include 0055 half-castes living as
Maoris, which makes a difference.
“Blue Forms'’: The men and the women
look at the Saturday-morning loaf with very
different pairs of eyes. A departmental cir-
cular asked for a note on the abolition of
Saturday morning toil by making up the
time on the other five days. Every one of
our office cats voted against it. “If we had
the morning at home,” they explained,
“we’d have to do the housework.”
According to Mrs. Lloyd George, when
Asquith went to Downing-street as Prime
Minister in 1907, there was not a bathroom
there. Pitt and Wellington, Peel, Glad-
stone, Beaeonsfield and Salisbury, Rosebery,
Balfour and Campbell-Bannerman had all
lived in the place that hadn’t a bathroom!
It recalls that when the Prince Consort fell
ill of typhoid Windsor Castle was examined
by medical authorities, who found that
stately pile possessed 28 cesspits.
“Dinkum Digger”: Why all this fuss about
“Pompey” Elliott? Such leaders as Glas-
gow, Brand, Gellibrand, Cannan, Leane and
•Timmy Heane saw as much desperate fight-
ing as he and his mob, if .not more. If there
was a sweepstakes as to the brigade which
had the toughest scrapping I’d take two
tickets on the 4th, commanded by Brand,
with another on the 13th. All of these fight-
ing Generals are now holding posts in the
Citizen Forces. And they didn’t “bend the
knee” any more than “Pompey” did.
“Bent Stem”: Alec Thomson, K.C., who
has just helped the Sydney Ferries over the
stile marked “Increased Fares,” is an en-
thusiastic Voluntary Worker. Once he was
trying to do some bricklaying, but the trowel
wouldn’t behave, so he threw it down and
stood by and watched a real bricklayer at
work. “Jove!” he said in admiration, “I
wish I could work the point like you do.”
Bricky looked up and smiled. “If I could
work as many points as you can, Mr. Thom-
son,” he said, “I wouldn’t be at this game.”
Considerable excitement is said to be jus-
tified by Professor David’s assurance that
there is water under the Nullarbor Plain in
places; and that, though some of it is salt,
some of it isn’t so salt as to be undrinkable
by cattle. The Bulletin is glad to hear
this about the vast wilderness adjacent to
the almost harborless Bight; but it has a
suspicion that if the Professor had gone out
into the desert and foqnd an unsuspected
range of factories capable of saving Aus-
tralia the £2,600,000 a year it sends abroad
for woollen piece-goods alone, the discovery
would have been worth more than the fee
simple of all Nullarbor.
From “Yours for the Secession, J.E.”: —
As “D. Tired” pointed out (B. 15/9/’2l), the
Brisbana Government shows signs of abandoning
the North. When it not only stops work on the line
which is to join North and South but sells the
materials, bought out of loans, for what little the.'
will fetch, because every odd copper is wanted in
Brisbane, 700 miles away, it looks, as like definite
abandonment as when that other record failure,
Honorius, stopped public works in Britain and with-
drew the staff. The failure isn’t for want of in-
come, for taxes have been heavily increased. But
the Government has too main- parasites to support,
just like Honorius, and too few brains or prin-
ciples. The North was a great asset seven years ago,
but Honorius Theodore’s isn’t a long-distance
Ministry, and anything more than 200 miles beyond
sound of its roar has fallen into decay. Unless
North Queensland provides itself with a State Gov-
ernment of its own it is likely very soon to have
none at all.
“Yoyang”: A search among old records
recently brought to light a comical fact
about the trusteeship of some land at Yass
(N.S.W.) belonging to? the R.C. Church.
About 1841 five allotments were handed to
the church, the trustees being Henry O’Brien,
Cornelius O’Brien and William Hampden
Dutton. The deeds were never claimed from
the Lands Office, and when that Department
had a cleaning-up in ’7O, a list of unclaimed
deeds published included these allotments,
and the sole trustee at that time was Arch-
deacon Lillingston, of "St. Clement’s Church
of England, Yass! This came about through
the three original trustees dying without
appointing successors, and as Lillingston
happened to be trustee for Cornelius O’Brien,
the last survivor, lie became trustee for R.C.
land. The point of Time’s little joke was that
Lillingston was a violent anti-Papist and was
in the habit of waging wordy war with the
sons of the Church in the columns of the
Yass Courier.
A recent cable mentioned the marriage in
the Stowe Parish Church, of Katharine Jack-
man, daughter of the village blacksmith, to
the Master of Kinloss, a grandson of the
last Duke of Buckingham. The bride’s fam-
ily and friend's rallied round, but “the
’groom’s family was not represented.” Luis
Chandos Morgan-Grenville, Master of Kin-
loss, is a curate, aged 31, and heir to one
of the largest, most ruined and most roman-
tic mansions in the U.K. He succeeded
when his brother Richard was killed in
action in 1914. Stowe passed to Baroness
Ivinloss, the cleric’s mother, on the death,
of her father, the last Duke of Buckingham ,
and Chandos, but without the funds neces-
sary to maintain it. It has a dining-table
at which 100 people can sit, and in its
ducal period it had a service of gold plate
to match. But for half-a-eentury the family
has been even prouder of the fact that
it is the only private home in which a royal
drawing-room was ever held. Queen Vic-
toria was “in” to the elite of Buckingham-
shire at Stowe about the middle of last cen-
tury. And now it is to be sold to a pro-
fiteer, either British or American, no other
class being in a position to keep it up.


The Cause. The Symptoms. The Remedy.
One of the most distressing
troubles a person can endure is
biliousness. It is depressing to the
spirits and demoralising to the entire
system. The person so afflicted is
scarcely able to work or take an
interest in anything. This is because
the sewers of the body are clogged and
need flushing out. The bile is turned from its proper
channel and enters the blood and produces that peculiar
plexion. .The sufferer may be-very restless,
eepless at night, or perhaps the slumber is
lethargic and dull. There are usually dull pains, uneasi-
ness under the right side and shoulder blades, a bitter
taste in the mouth, sudden dizziness on rising, furred
tongue, bowels loose one day and constipated the next.
All or any of these conditions may accompany the bilious
condition, and while so afflicted the patient’s life is
scarcely worth living. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
relieve this trouble speedily and cast the burden from the
spirits. They open the clogged-up system, purify the
blood, and once more the human mechanism works
smoothly and easily;

DAILY HOT WATER is a NECESSITY
—makes things move smoothly in the kitchen for cooking and
cleaning—lightens the work in the laundry—and comforts
and refreshes in the bathrooms. Establishments catering for
public support without an adequate hot-water service cannot
be said to be giving that degree of ordinary comfort demanded
by the traveller and tofurist.
Ideal Hot Water Supply
“Ideal” boilers will supply from 20 to 2000 gallons
of heated wholesome water per hour, according
to size, and whether for family or public use.
They burn coal, coke or wood, as well as com-
bustible household rubbish, and require little
attention. The slow-combustion principle burns the
fuel to a fine ash and reduces fuel bills—-in some
instances by half.
An “Ideal” installation will reduce your working
expenses, attract new business, and pay for itself.
Send a rough plan of your requirements, and we will
submit an approximate price and plan by an
experienced heating expert.
Our advioe costs nothing—take advantage of it
now.

. “Paddy, the Next Best Thing,” unfolded
itselt at Sydney Criterion on Saturday, pre-
ceded bv the report that it had amused
Adelaide. Whether it will amuse Sydney,
or will be doing so a fortnight hence, is
doubtful. It certainly has many of the in-
gredients of popularity, as popularity went
111.l 11 . Paddy herself is the traditional
Irish heroine, the unconventional hoyden of
convention, who talks incessantly, and at
times tediously, when she isn’t romping or
singing or dancing the jig of her nation.
Her. father the general, Micky the family
retainer, the two dear old maiden ladies
and Lord Sellaby, the silly ahss, are all
old acquaintances. Mrs. Bingle and Mrs.
Putter, two battered old Cockney tarts,
walk straight out of a Phil May drawing
into the third act. Familiar also is the
well-nourished man of the world who tames
Paddy, and who eats a real meal in a rail-
way carriage that is surprisingly like the
true thing. But the public which used to
regard this kind of play with an indulgent
eye is gone beyond recall. Nowadays the
stuff has to stand strictly on its merits, and
the merits of “Paddy, the Next Best Thing,”
are not overwhelming. True it is also,
although; the fact is saddening, that Sydney’s
temper has changed as w T ell as its* taste;
wherefore some people will find Paddy too
Irish and others not Irish enough. Isobel
Brosnan struggles bravely, and with notable
success at times, to make the lady interest-
ing. Miss -Brosnan is a personable young
woman with an appealing voice and plenty
of talent and vivacity, and will do still better
in a better play. Claude Flemming acts
pleasantly as Paddy’s lover, but strikes one
as being a bit too ripe for the part. And
in the scene in which he bawls his way into
the girl’s affections Claude is not at his best.
Nobody else has much to do. The small
tasks of the newcomers, Doris Kendal, Anew
McMaster and Spencer Fisher, are satisfac-
torily performed. Cecil Ivellaway’s represen-
tation of the half-pay general is a fine little

WOMAN,” AT SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE.

study, . and Beryl Bryant as a dashing
“society” miss both speaks and looks well.
Faithful work is also done by Iza Millett,
Rodger Barry and Fred Cambourne.
In spite of the prevailing absorption in the
deeds of Beauford and David. “The Maid of
the Mountains,” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
and “Oh, Lady. Lady 1” at the Royal, con-
tinue their ignoble mission of earning money
for all concerned.
=f- * * *
“Tea for Three.” the comedy of a sportive
wife, a philandering bachelor and a jealous
husband, is drawing large audiences of wives
who never frisk, bachelors who never phi-
lander, and husbands who are never jealous
to Sydney Palace.
On Saturday night Yerbrugglien sent
through Sydney Town Hall such a flood of
V' agner as had not been heard since the
war put the noisy composer on this nation’s
black books. But apparently all had been
forgiven ; for the well-performed Ride of the
\ alkyries had to be repeated, and the dis-
cerning saw m the better-performed prelude
to the third act of “Tristan and Isolde” rare
beauty even if Wagner was born in Leipzig.
There was a little Bizet and a gavotte
from Ambrose Thomas’s "Mignon”; and
Strella Wilson and Errolle filled the second
part with melody—polyglot melody so far as
Miss Wilson was concerned, for her contribu-
tions were in English, French and Italian.
Their best was the duet from the Nile scene
in “Aida”; and if the sopranos “Jewel
Song” had been as good it would have been
very much better.
Spring is here, wincn probably accounts
for the present prolific crop of warblers at
Sydney Tivoli. This week’s added attrac-
tions include Arthur Aldridge, a pleasing
tenor; Nell Fleming, an animated little
vocalist: and the queen of them all, Lottie
Collins, jun., who makes a hit in her panto
principal-boy r. le. Also, sojourning at this
house is Balmus, a physical culturist, whose
art-posing rivals that of the Botanic Gar-
den statues, and he has more fingers than
most of them. And Stuart Barnes is still
coming home drunk.
Following on the success of “Humoresque”
comes “The Greatest Love,” with Vera Gor-
don again in the star part which falls to the
mother. And so “more of the same kind”
will continue to be milled until the public
becomes nauseated. The son of an Italian
immigrant .family in N’York doesn’t go west
to seek his fortune ; he keeps a bright eye
on the crowded traffic centres, and when he
sees a flutter of Fifth Avenue crepe de Chine
about to be reeled over by a high-power
limousine he stretches forward the helping-
hand and drags her to a place of safety.
Properly staged this is a never-failing recipe
for fame and fortune. Of course that is not
the end of the story. Sydney Hoyt’s, Picca-
dilly and the Australian run the rest of it as
a star production. The same three houses
show Edith Roberts spending a week in a
high-prided hotel in pursuit of the hero of
her girlish dreams, Monte Moseville. On
bill-day Monte has to come to his lady ad-
mirer’s aid, and it’s the “Afterwards” that
makes her totter back. Francesca Bertini
supplies neurotic soul-torturings at the
Crystal Palace. On the same sheet Monte
Blue turns “A broken Doll” into a pathetic
philosophy of life. The Lyceum has a little
shopgirl who entangles a Duke in the matri-
monial noose. The story is called “Simple
Souls,” but the Duke’s family regard it as
a case of simply sold. Charles Ray puts a
punch into “Scrap Iron” at the Strand.
Clara Butt never sang anything more
artistic than her opening arias, “Rendi T
Sereno” (Handel) and “Amour Yiens
Rendre” (Gluck), at Melbourne Town Hall
on Saturday. The latter from “Orpheus,”
which she had sung at Covent Garden, was
of rare sweetness compared with “The Keys
of Heaven,” which she jangled for the ump-
teenth time with Kennerley Rum ford. As
an encore she did a Russian lullaby, set to
a wheedling measure and in language im-
possible to Lenin or Trotzky, but her big
artesian notes shook the building in “Among
the Rocks” of Robert Browning. Also there
were “Nesting Time” and the quaint fancy of
“A Fairy Went a-Marketing,” which she
delivered to the crowd in front and then
repeated to the mass in the organ gallery.
“Kathleen Mavourneen” headed her contri-
butions of popular confectionery, in which
the indefatigable Kennerley also* did a brisk
trade. The audience banged its hands to
pulp over the glueosy strains of his “Re-
jected Lover” and the equally saccharine
“More Sweet Is That Name.” If he had
followed his wife’s example for his first
encore, he might have tried something un-
usual, like a drinking song in Czech or
Siamese, but he stuck to the ancient “Swal-
lows Homeward Fly” and had another tor-
nado to add to his bliss. Daniel Melsa, who
oromises to improve on acquaintance, fiddled
beautifully in the “Ave Maria” of Schubert-
Wilhemj, and played prettily with the fire-
works of Auer’s arrangement of a Paganini
Caprice. Hi's long first item, “Devil’s Trill”
(Tartini-Kreisler), suggested in spots that
the Devil was sharpening his tail, but the
music demonstrated Melsa’s resources as a
bowmam. Grace Torrens brought the piano
into notice, and W. F. G. Steele took com-
mand of the organ. The Dame’s third con-
cert happens to-night, and the Yoice will
breathe o’er Melbourne again on Saturday
and Tuesday next.
This is the week after the Show in Mel-
bourne, when a certain amount of cleaning
up takes place. At the Princess’s the giddy
theatrical story of “Scandal” will cease to
be gay after to-night, and anyone who unisses
this final Thursday opportunity of being
shocked will have only herself to blame.
At Melbourne Majesty’s the revival of
“Chu Chin Chow’’ breathes its last to-night
preparatory to doing wonderful business at
Geelong and Ballarat. On Saturday comes
"Firefly,” with Rene Maxwell in the name-
part and Ralph Errolle, Flemming and one or
tw r o others new to this co.

moral is not intensely popular. Everyone
ouglit to approve of the idea of a husband
with dollars to burn and a wife who dreads
the lire being anxious to spread a little sun-
shine in the lives of deserving widows and
spinsteis and if they are “on the make”
the little weakness is not unwomanly. But,
somehow, the spirit of kindness outside the
family circle gets no wifely approval what-
ever. One feels at the finish that the most
Coyne can expect is not to have “His Ladv
friends thrown at him oftener than six-
times a day.
The long arm of Providence is still being
stretched to help mill-owner Jefferson
against his enemy at Melbourne King’s.
When Jefferson is almost blotted out by
brutal competition and he is wondering
whether he can pay a button in the f, a
strange Yankee inventor restores his top-
pling credit with a method of doubling his
output without any noticeable increase in
his working exes. Naturally the American
is regarded as a miracle, but his interven-
tion is a terrible reflection on the self-
reliance of Bert Bailey Jefferson.
Dorothea Spinney, at Melbourne Play-
house, is not a matter to be mentioned among
the Philistines as “a bit of orlright.” But
being a monologue artist whose appeal is to
the intellectual, and whose ambition is to
get a large hearing at the set-off of her sea-
son, she opens in “Hamlet” to-night. Ages
have elapsed since a lady recited “Hamlet”
in Melbourne.
An uncommon solution of the Eternal
Triangle is visible in “The Little Fool” at
Melbourne Majestic this week. The story
is borrowed from .Jack London’s “Little Lady
of the Big House,” but it reads much better
than it films. Frank Keenan, as a ship-
builder with an ace up his sleeve for every
machination by a group of schemers, is
lively in “The False Code” at the same house.
At Hoyt’s an escaped convict in “The
Door” starts a series of surprises that lead
up to a climax of blank astonishment. For
a film this item deserves a medal for origin-
ality. On the other hand, “The Unknown
Wife” is a moth-eaten tale. The route of
its plot has been worn into gullies by the
high heels of countless movie-queens. There
is a steady flow into the Britannia’s treasury,
owing to Clara Ivimball Young producing
limited evidence of her enormous dress allow-
ance. Four people are catching “Midsum-
mer Madness” at the Melba, and the results
are- sensational until their temperatures go
down.,
A couple of shows in Melbourne: —
The Upper Athenaeum is the present refuge of over
a hundred efforts in oil and water-color by Ethel
Bishop, Adelaide Perry and H. M. Paterson. The
last-named, a returned Digger, hangs 32, mostly
water-color impressions of English and French scenes,
but including “Winter,” a capital study in oil,
the best thing in the room. Miss Bishop shows
evidence of having pored over Old Masters in Eng-
lish galleries, but her drawing is not always sound
and the painting of the clasped hands in “The
Daughters” is a long way after Gainsborough. But
she masses black and green effectively in “Pierrette,”
and her water-color portraits are agreeable. Her
landscapes in the same medium are indefinite. Miss
Perry, who won the Travelling Scholarship last year,
shows promise in a couple of dashing water-colors
(Nos. 70 and 82), but, generally speaking, her art
is too unripe for exhibition. Even her scholarship
picture, “News from the Front,” seems very juvenile.
W. Rowbotham depicts the murky inhabitants of
India in several cheerful canvases at the Queen’s
Hall. His types range from fakir-like ancients to
unkempt villagers and dapcing-girls, and he uses a
palette like a fruit-salad to do bare justice to their
radiant clothes. One half-clad damsel, off to
worship, must have been apprenticed to a durbar
dressmaker, and a “Mosaic Coat,” sported by a well-
browned Brummell, was probably collected from the
sweepings of a tie-factory. Rowbotham also pre-
sents some Indian landscape effects and vivid street
scenes, and for a contrast fills a wall with Austra-
lian landscapes in water-color. He catalogues several
as “Sonnets," but the foreground doesn’t always
rhyme with the background, and the color is rather
flat and commonplace. He does better in “Tie
Farm Path,” and No. 35 pictures a charming memory
of the Ponte Vecchio, Florence.
Dorothea Spinney has been giving a series
of her recitals in Adelaide. That city was
always fond of her work, but on this visit
she has unwisely taken an out-of-the-way
small hall, and the public has not found her
out. Her artistry is sound as ever, and
she makes the old Greek legends so live that
those who come in the spirit of encouraging
culture come again for pure enjoyment. The
main feature in the variety bill at the King’s
is a revue co. headed by Ward and Sherman;
it is very American in the stuff it produces,
but it gets the hearty laugh. At the P. of
W., Arthur Vance has shared the honors in
melodrama with Guy Hastings and Leslie
Adrienne. A white-slave sensation is pro-
mised next. In pictures there is much stern
and strenuous work: Louise Glaum in a
murder mystery, “I am Guilty” (but she
wasn’t), at West’s; a neglected wife thought-
fully prevented from suicide by Providence,
“Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness,” at the
Pav.; and a “blasted love in draperies of
convention” —the management calls it that —
at the Majestic. As contrast, not for a long
time has such continuous laughter been heard
in an Adelaide theatre as over “The Ghost
in the Garret” at Wondergraph. Dorothy
Gish, disguised as an armchair, is equally
funny, whether scuttling about or posing as
furniture. The State-schools’ concerts of
the "Thousand Voices” used to take one even-
ing. There are now three. Beally effec-
tive in both singing and acting, they show
what music can do to tame the savage breast
at the most impressionable age.
Sydney Women Painters’ rooms were be-
sieged by nearly 200 guests on Friday, when
Myrtle Thorne’s energetic committee made
another appeal on behalf of the young con-
tralto. Myrtle’s concert in the Town Hall
on the 25th of next month should hare a
record house, for rice-president Mrs. Mat-
thews distributed not less than 500 tickets
before the erening’s well-dressed gathering
dispersed.

A TEXACO ROOF IS A
WATERPROOF ROOF.
Texaco roofing is manufac-
factured from fine, selected felt,
thoroughly saturated and cpated
with Texaco Asphal t —the most
thoroughly waterproof material known
to man.
You can hang up a piece of Texaco
Roofing in such a manner as to form a
shallow pocket, and keep that pocket
filled with water—rain-water or salt-
water, or refuse-water impregnated with
acids—and the roofing will remain whole.

“Yarra Ben”: One of the most desirable
sites in the centre of Melbourne has been
acquired by the inevitable “picture syndi-
cate,” and before many months are over a
truly palatial movie-house will have sprung
up in Swanston-street, almost opposite the
Town Hall. A dance-saloon and refresh-
ment-rooms on the American pattern are in-
cluded in the scheme. It is going to cost
something like a quarter of a million pounds
—not dollars —to complete.

Thing,” at Sydney
Criterion.

than she ought to
be. On the recent
65th anniversary
of her first appear-
ance on the stage
(when she made a
sad show of de-
crepitude) she was
supposed to be only
78. Records pub-
lished as long ago
as 1878 state that
she came to stage
light in 1856, when
she was eight years
old. Say that she
was then really 11
or 12, she would
still be consider-
ably younger than
Genevieve Ward,
or that stout old
battler Mrs. G. B.
W. Lewis. Her
misfortune in life,
seemingly, ' was
that she never had
to wo r k ha r d
enough for her
luxurious social
position. As com-
par e d with the
ordinary popular
actress, Ellen Terry
at 50 had studied few parts and done very
little travelling.
“Peter”: Actress Fanny Wiseman, who
reappeared as one of the witches in Allan
Wilkie’s production Of “Macbeth” at Mel-
bourne Princess’s last year, recently reached
her 76th birthday. It is a coincidence that
she started her career in 1859 as one of the
spooks in G. Y. Brooke’s “Macbeth” at the
old Melbourne Queen’s.
“Violet Valley”: Before M. P. Adams
left Australia with the Wild North-West film
which has just made a hit in London, he
tried to interest the Federal mandarins in
it. He didn’t ask for any subsidy, but
only for some sort of recognition that he
could quote in London. A friendly press-
man introduced him to Shepherd, then secre-
tary to the Priminister’s Department, and
now Acting High Commissioner. But Shep-
herd couldn’t see that pictures of turtles and
pearling-fleets and blackfellows would be
any advt. for Australia, His idea of adver-
tising us is to show photos of Melbourne
and Sydney, with a few stock views of the
Blue Mountains and Fern-tree Gully. So
Adams went without the Commonwealth im-
primatur ; but the lack of it hasn’t hurt
him.
“T.R.H.”: Dick Lean, who is running
Melbourne Stadium for Jack Wren, now
features a variety programme. A last
week’s turn advertised in the Age was:—
Juggling by BILLY HUGHES, BILLY HUGHES,
BILLY HUGHES.
And Lean claims to stage new stuff!
“Royee Rolls”: Sara Allgood, who had a
long run in Australia as Peg o’ My Heart,
was lately at the London Court Theatre,
doing the Widow Quin in a revival of Synge’s
“Playboy of the Western World.” Sara
appeared in the first Yankee season of the
piece, when the Irish-American populace
became so restive that the company had to
call in the police.
Louis Verneuil, Bernhardt’s grandson-in-
law, has had the distinction of getting all
his plays banned in a batch by the Censor
in London. All kinds of “influence” were

THING,” AT

promptly brought to bear*, and a short season
at the Garrick was played in July. One
thing, however, the Censor remained obdurate
over. He would not have —even in French
-—the play-title “Mademoiselle ma Mfere,”
and it had to be called something else for
London consumption.
“Alwyn” :At last! Barrie has been per-
suaded to write a film scenario for his “Peter
Pan," and John S. Robertson has been en-
gaged by Paramount tp direct the show. All
the parts are to be played by children.
“Norbell”: When the Royal Comics did
“lolanthe” in Ivalgoorlie (W.A.) years ago,
the coronets of the peers had been inadver-
tently left behind in Perth. This was not
discovered till within a few hours of the
performance ; but the handy Props, devised
Very effective substitutes out of gilt coffin-
trimmings which he procured from a local
undertaker,
“Hamfat”: The Taits’ first venture into
management was a gamble on painfully-
collected savings. The brothers had been
filling small jobs—clerical mostly—and it
was while doing overtime as ushers at con-
certs and similar entertainments that the
idea of running some show themselves
occurred. They pooled their savings, and
then happened upon the chance to tour
Clara Butt. That oiled the brethren’s
chariot wheels so well that they have never
stood still since.
Robert Courtneidge, who brought “The
Man from Toronto” to Australia, but sent
“Paddy, the Next Best Thing,” has a bunch
of good things on tour in England, includ-
ing lan Hay’s “Safety Match,” the old
“Arcadians,” a Shakspeare co., and the two
plays first named. In fact, there are four
separate companies out with “Paddy.”
The third generation of Irving is coming
along in Lqndon. Elizabeth, grand-daughter
of Henry and daughter of P 1.8., has, at 17,
played Titania and Trilby with success.
Her mother, Dorothea Baird, was the ori-
ginal Trilby. Elizabeth played the part be-
fore the Australian cricketers during the
Canterbury “week,” as one of the Old
Stagers, a strong co. in which the men are
all amateurs.
“E.T.” : Martha _ Stanley and Adelaide
Mathews, the two ’Murkan women drama-
tists who were responsible for Joseph
Coyne’s biggest hit, “Nightie Night,” are
once again showing on Broadway. At the
playhouse they have a comedy called “The
Teaser.” Australian Leonard Willey is well
up in the cast
"T.D.M.”: Dame Nellie Melba might go
one better than the “dollar concert” (B.
22/9/’2l) if she is really desirous of en-
shrining herself in the hearts of many thou-
sands who have not had the good iuck to
hear her. Although she might hesitate to
sing for a bob there is a precedent. Patti
sang at Covent Garden to the gods for half-
a-crown.
“Old Pot”: Bessie Major, who made a
London reputation in “Chu Chin Chow.”
came to Australia in 1885 with her two
sisters, Florence Trevelyan (Mrs. Brough)
and Emma Temple. Mrs. Brough supported
Frank Thornton in “The Private Secre-
tary” before she was transferred to the
Sydney Royal to play the Fairy Queen in
lolanthe,” but Bessie Major and Emma
Temple had made minor appearances in
comic opera. It was not until Robert
Brough had joined forces with Dot Bouci-
cault and formed the burlesque co. headed
by Fanny Robina and E. W. Royce that
Emma Temple came into her own. Both she
and Miss Major—then plump but not nearly
so solid as she is to-day—made good ; and
Emma Temple to-day is one of the greatest
“old-women” on the English-speaking stage.
Bessie Major made a hit in “Kismet” when
Asche brought it here. Another trio of
sisters well known on the English stage saw
Australia, but not at the same time. They
were Letty Lind, one of the dancers of the
first Gaiety Co., Fanny Dango and Lydia
I lop. Letty subsequently developed into a
comedy artist. Lydia came to the Com-
monwealth on a visit only, and didn’t show
on the players’ side of the footlights.
“Lud”: “The Sign on the Door,” which
was not exactly , a riot when presented in
Sydney a few months back (it has not yet
been seen anywhere else in Australia), is
to be done in London this autumn. The
beauteous Gladys Cooper will appear in the
Maude Hanaford role.
“Rienzi”: The Americanisation of our
picture-shows is nearly complete. At a
popular show the other night I found
Yankee pictures on the screen, Yankee gum
and _ candy on the sweet-trays, and Bowery
music in the orchestra. But the worst knock
came at the end of the show when a bobbed-
haired flapper restored my hat which had
rolled under her seat with “Here y’are, kid!”
“Lud” : Combinations of actors who have
become their own managers in London re-
cently are doing well, and it is a wonder to
me that the scheme has not been tried by
the scores of reputable mummers who are
unemployed in Australia. The West End
Royalty Theatre has been run for some
months past by a company called “The Co-
Optimists,” and a movement by the English
Actors’ Assoc, in the same direction looks
like being a similar success. A fund is
being got together for the purpose: among
other supporters is John Galsworthy, who
has promised the use of one of his plays.
“C. Ockney” : “Threads,” Frank Stayton’s
novel, reviewed lately in The Bulletin, has
raced on to the stage. The author, originally
an actor, who joined up as a private and rose
to be captain during the war, is his own
adaptor. The piece was produced at the
St. James’s with Lyn Harding in the lead
and a good comedy character for C. M.
Lowne, who, as a youngster, travelled round
the globe with J. L. Toole.
“E.T.” : The younger generation is knock-
ing at the door. In the cast of the musical
comedy version of Pinero’s old farce “The
Schoolmistress,” recently staged at London
Queen’s, is E. Louis Bradfield, a son of the
debonair mummer who was , a matinee idol
in the days of the George Edwardes Gaiety
co. in Australia.
“Wymac”: In reply to “J.F.H.” (B.
21/7/’2l), Daphne Pollard made her debut
in Melbourne in 1908 in her father’s Lillipu-
tian Opera co.
“Ancient Prompter” : My friend and col-
league Toby Blink is the best-intentioned
actor that ever faced a Backblocks audience,
but he cannot get out of the habit of forget-
ting his lines, more especiallv when his part
doesn’t fit him. If he is anything Toby is a
comeaian, and through lonv study of gag-
books he has become fairly proficient in that
line. On our last tour of the smalls Toby was
given the part of Laertes in “Hamlet,” be-
cause —well, someone had to do it. During
rehearsals he gave the company many a thrill
when he made his first entrance with Ophelia
and started to declaim: —
My necessaries are embarked ; farewell!
And, sister, as the winds give benefit....
Our sporting property-man offered to take
short odds about Toby “drying up dead on
the night.” He would have lost money.
Though he never got his tongue round “My
necessaries are embarked,” Toby was not
exactly at a loss. He looked round the
shabby apartment, which was the best our
boss could do to suggest “A Room in Polo-
nius’s House,” and remarked jauntily:
“You’ve got a nice place here, Sis!”
“De Oriel” : When a celebrated lock defier
and handcuff king was doing the smalls in
Vic. he once walked four miles to get the
key of a country hall from the caretaker.
“Snell”: I can just remember when Tom
Thumb and Mrs.
At Mc[?]otirm Tiroli.
Crighton, the jugg ler.
Tom and Commo-
dore Nutt came to
Ballarat. They were
received like
princes, the towm
turning out to
greet them. There
was much public
disputation as to
the genuine quality
of the exhibits,
which culminated
in a big Bungaree
native grabbing up
Tom Thumb and
starting to tear the
clothes oil him.
Tom was almost
denuded before res-
cue came. The
assailant pleaded
in court that the
figures were autom-
a t o n s, arid h i s
sole,, desire was to
expose the fraud.
It was in Ballarat,
too, that Tom
Thumb received
that other insult, a
matron inquiring
in his hearing,
“Poor little chap! Is he weaned?”
The cloak-room attendant’s story:—
The man twisted into the cloak-room with the
aspect of one who had been seeing ghosts and didn't
like them. “That woman in the purple dress with
the black wrap,” he whispered to me —“watch her.
and I’ll give you five bob.” I couldn’t see any
woman in a purple dress, but I was on that five bob.
“Yes,” I said. “She’s waitin’,” he said. “I haven’t
seen her for five years, and I don’t want to see her
for another five.” Presently I noticed that the attend-
ant in the ladies’ room was throwing out signals, and
I slipped across. “There’s a woman in here,” she
says, “hiding from her husband. Shie’s promised me
a good tip if he doesn’t spot her. He’s a fattish,
bald man with a limp.” “Yes,” I 'said, “I’ve got
him. Take your money, and let her slip out.” I
went back to my man and presently-the girl signals
“All clear!” I thought the missing lady had gone
into the theatre, so, after collecting, I advised the
man to chase himself downstairs. Being curious I
went down a few steps to watch developments, and
was just in time to see the two jamb-in the doorway
of the same taxi-cab!
“S.S.”: The play was “The World Against
Her,” a touching mass of turgid sentimen-
talism, in which the heroine j was brought
to a helpless condition in a snowstorm by the
machinations of the black-moustached vil-
lain, but was befriended by a ’poor but comic
showman. Talking over her hapless lot with
the showman’s wife in the latter’s humble
home, the good girl was interrupted by the
arrival of the'landlord demanding rent with
the unreasoning persistence of\ landlords in.
the teeth of absolute impecuhiosity. The
landlord had just been disposed of, and the
heroine was once more bemoaning lier hap-
less lot, when a gentleman, a friend of the
manager, crossing the stage behind, tripped
over a fire bucket and shot head-first
through a rotten old back cloth; which made
the wall of the showman’s home, landing on
all fours in the presence of the ladies, and in
full view of the audience. Then followed the
best bit of presence of mind I ever witnessed
in an actress. The showman’s wife looked
at the • intruder, arms akimbo: “This,
deary,” she said, “will be the gasman. Just
a minute while I throw him out.” And
throw him out she did.
“Billy T.”: “I once played A a part in
‘Romeo and Juliet,’ ” said an old Bland Holt
stage-hand to me. “You!” I replied. “Yes,
me. I don’t look a great actor, sez you, and
p’raps yer right, but I once played a most
important part, supportin’ Miss Vincent,
who yiv heard of.” “What part did you
play?” He grinned. “I played the bal-
cony.” “The balcony?” He nodded. “You
see, we found at the last miniate that the
bench weVl knocked together for Juliet in
her chat with Romeo wasn’t up to it. In
fact, it went to pieces. No time was to be
wasted. Romeo would be waitim’ and the
best scene in the play would gor to smash.
So as the heftiest man in the crowd, and
the one w T ith the broadest back, I played
balcony, and played it damwell, too, let me
tell you. Nobody in the audie'aee listenin
to the lady dreamed she was perched ou the
back of a sufferin’, man wit) a her heels
grindin’ into his spine—and tile lady was
no sparrerweight, neither. She had to keep
one hand on the scenery to stay , her, but we
managed without a tumble.”
THE INADEQUATE DANCER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Since Mrs. Pilf would learn to dance
Poor Henry Pilf must slide and prance
With others in a row—
Must stand like this, and bend like that, and shuffle
to and fro,
And try to. do a giddy twirl upon his tortured- toe.
Now, pretty little Mrs. Pilf
She wagged a trilby like a sylph,
And speedily she learned
The three-step and the one-step. Highest praise the
lady earned,
While like a bloated roller on his axis Henry turned.
They bade the tyro face the north,
And thrust his left foot neatly forth.
The thing seemed very clear,
But when he had to slide the right he did it with
some fear,
And finished up the slide across the ballroom on liis
ear.
Neat Mrs. Pilf had partners who
All quaint intricacies could do,
But Henry, out of breath,
Danced awkward Jane, and limping Sis, and fat
Elizabeth.
He walked upon them awfully, and trampled them to
death.
In queerest ways his moods were shown.
He danced on feet, but not his own.
He lamed the teachers all,
For when he could not climb their shins or butt them
to the wall,
Eventually he fixed them with a shocking flying fall.
Now, Mrs. Pilf must to the ball
Go on her own, or not at all.
Should Henry Pilf show near
The dames would break the fire-alarms and bid the
p’lice appear
To guard them from an enemy they hold in deadly
fear.
But Henry goes to dance no more.
He lingers hid beyond the door—
In sorrow he can see
That Crusoe and old Christo were not half as lone as
he
Who dances like a hippo playing hop-scotch on the
spree.
VICTORIA.

MICK SIMMONS
PR OPERLY
In the words of some of his colleagues in
the Australian XI, Armstrong “made a mess of it”
when he elected to teach the English how to win
Test matches. No one will believe that he meant his
remarks about the English professionals for publica-
tion, and it is equally obvious that the “anonymous
county cricketer” who set about the big man in
the Observer was waiting for the chance. Ann-
strong has always had a gift for making- enemies.
But his position should have made him wary, and the
fact that it didn't is going to cause ill-feeling'- in
England quite as acute as that aroused here by the
indiscretion of Fender and Wilson.
A clear proof of the mala fides of the Observer scribe
is his assumption that Armstrong used the word
“professional” in an offensive sense. Nothing would
be further from the truth. The gibe about future
Australian players “changing in the professionals’
dressing-rooms” loses any point it might otherwise
possess from the fact that Australian teams have
never asked to be “mistered,” are never so labelled
in their own country, and would undoubtedly as
soon change with a pro. as anyone else. As regards
the taking of money over and above expenses, there
is not a pin to choose between the Australians and
dozens of English amateurs (so called), whom every-
body knows to be more or less living on the game.
But the English pro. is in a different category from
either the Australian who is frank about his “cut”
of the gate and the Englishman who isn’t. Cricket
is the pro.'s sole means of livelihood. For the weekly
TOMMY O'BRIEN, one of Sydney Stadium’s
latest imports, who knocked out Jimmy
Hill in four rounds on Saturday night.
wage which his club pays him, he not only plays in
matches, but howls to members, at the net, coaches
them in batting, looks after the pavilion and
keeps the ground in order. it is this type that
Armstrong would have been referring to in his
comments on professionals’ methods of play; and
by no other word than professional could the type
have been indicated. One useful service the row
should do the game, and that is to draw renewed
attention to the anomalous state of affairs as re-
gards the pro-amateur issue, both here and in Eng-
land. So long as cricketers are allowed to remain
lily-white while doing things that would lose them,
at the first attempt, their amateur status on a foot-
ball field, in a swimming-bath or at a stadium, so
long will there be recriminations, and as a result
ruinous ill-feeling.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: Old George Hirst, now a coach
at Eton, takes his farewell of cricket this month,
captaining a Players’ team against the “Gentlemen”
at Scarborough, and receiving all the proceeds, plus
a big subscription list. His 50th birthday occurs
during the match. Lord Hawke, for years his cap-
t;hn, gives him a hearty but qualified testimonial,
as ‘ the greatest cricketer who ever played for
Yorkshire, and the greatest county professional
- different from a Test-match cricketer —who
has every played for any county.” It is sound
criticism. Hirst’s figures are astonishing. He played
for Yorkshire in 1889, when under 18, and was
really prominent till 1920; 1000 runs and 100
wickets in 14 different seasons (record) ; 2000 or
200 several times; and in 1900 ' both (2385 runs,
208 wickets). And yet, though useful in a score
of Test matches, he was probably never so for-
midable to Australians as Richardson or Lohmann,
Briggs or Braund (of far less repute than Hirs„),
or, from his own county, Ulyett or Peel.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman*”: The falling off of the
North of England in cricket is remarkable since the
days when Lancashire, then Nottingham, then York-
shire could alone have put six or seven men in an
English XI without weakening it. Of the 29 who
have had international honors this season, 22 are
from the South, and if a Test match had to be
played to-morrow there might be only one name from
the North, and that arguable—Parkin. In the Leeds
Test it was noticed that the crowd was particularly
kindly to the only Yorkshire man engaged—the Aus-
tralian Carter. One might wager that it was the
first Test (in 40 years) in which this had been so.

Woodville (by Linacre) took the Hawkes-
hury Guineas on Saturday with conspicuous ease.
Dan Seaton’s Kenilworth colt Honey Bee, an odds-
on favorite, was well beaten before the last furlong
of the mile had been reached. Woodville may he a
Derby possibility, but the probabilities are that
his oats will be earned over short courses. He is
about the most promising sprinter among the young-
horses now in training at Randwick, and is owned
by T. C. Trautwein, proprietor of the once-famous
Quinologist.
Two favorites crashed at Hawkesbury on Saturday
—Swift Shot in the Spring Handicap and Gilra.y
jn the Rowley Mile.. Swift Shot, who had been well
backed for the Metrop., took no part in the finish,
which was fought out by Dan Seaton’s scraggy-look-
ing mare Sandbee, winner of the Newcastle Cup,
and the Victorian-owned Queen Comedv, third in
last Melbourne Cup. Sandbee cut the" other lady
oown in the last few strides. Gilray can scarcely
have a possible in the Epsom after Saturday. He
had every chance, and his inability to pace it with
Julia Grey, Peroration and Caboclion suggests that he
is trainii g off.
A.J.C. Derby, to be run on Saturday,
seems to be as much a. guessing competition as a
horse-race. Furious will, of course, start favorite,
she has been galloping so well on the track since
winning the Rosehill Guineas that Frank Marsden
is confident of her staying out the mile and a half.
Harvest King is a good-looking- fellow with snfooth
action, and on breeding he is to be preferred over
the Derby distance to the more brilliant Furious.
Others in the picture are Loyal Irish, who has gone
through an exceptionally solid preparation ; Popaway,
who galloped brilliantly at Rosehill behind Beauford ;
and Honey Bee. Despite the Bee’s failure in tne
Hawkesbury Guineas it is not unlikely that over the
longer journey he will be sticking to it when others
are stopping.
* * * *
Beauford threatens to start the shortest-
priced favorite on record for the Epsom. He is in
great heart, will be ridden by an accomplished horse-
man and is certainly the most brilliant miler now
racing in the Commonwealth. Still the Epsom is
always a hard race to win, and one that has been
often taken by long-priced outsiders. Killiek’s
crack may find Mac Jack and Diinwil giving him
a certain amount of cheek at the business end of
the proceedings.
*- * * *
David and Syce Knight come together on
the first day in the Spring Stakes w.f.a., and if either
wins he should be a likely chance for the Metrop.
The indications are that David will be hard to beat.
* * * *
Two humble relatives of equine celebrities
are showing form in the West. Hare Hatch, a
brother to Gloaming, captured a small race during
the goldfields meetings, and Winged Victory, a
brother to Biplane, was first home in a Second-class
Plate at Goodwood, a Perth course. Hare Hatch
is now too old to ever be anything more' than a
third-rater, but the Comedy King-Air Motor steed
won his race in good style, and is young enough to
be capable of improvement. Not that he is ever
likely to be half as brilliant as Biplane was at his

Sasanof was out of a place in the Avon-
dale (M.L.) Cup on Saturday, won by the Danube
gelding Molyneaux, a probable visitor to Australia
shortly. Amythas, with Gloaming and Duo away,
made hacks of the rest in the Flying at Wanganui
on the first day, and he repeated the dose in the
Eclipse Stakes at w.f.a. on the second. The Douglas
Estate’s Hawk, who was such a smasher as a two-
year-old, is not running to expectations. The
.Martian gelding was third to Tamatete and Thes-
pian, both by Absurd (Loyal Irish’s sire) in the
Wanganui Guineas, and filled the same position to
Thespian in the Owen Handicap on the concluding
day.
* * * *
The eight-year-old Great War (Alawa —
Ruction) put in a good hour’s' work at Geelong,
winning two races, Newtown Plate and Barwon
Welter. Both times the gelding was ridden by
Erie Connolly’s apprentice, V. Sleigh, who has
started the season in great form. Geelong is Great
War’s happy hunting-ground. During his career he
has captured 16 races, seven of them on the -Pivot
course. “Horses for courses,” onc-e again !

Nothing special happened at Moonee Val-
ley (Vic.) last- Saturday except a victory for Pur-
ser and another licking for Easing-wold, whose
seconds might as well sky the towel. Next Satur-
day the October meeting at Flemington should cast
another spotlight on Holt’s hand for the Caulfield
Cup.
“Old Sport”: Some of the A. J.C. stewards’
decisions of late have been hard to understand. L.
A. Walker was ordered to stand down for four months
at Warwick Farm because he was held responsible
for the mishap which brought about the death of
Pickles. Then R. J. Marsden was suspended for
two months at Rosehill for forcing a passage be-
tween Duke Isinglass and Braehead. On top of
these punishments jockey Teddy Bartle now gets six
months’ suspension for cribbing a post-position at
Wyong Park —a relatively minor offence. Stipendi-
ary stewards Hyde and Mitchell conducted the in-
quiry, and it is doubtful whether any action would
have been taken had not a section of "the bookmakers
squealed so loudly when Jean Roxburgh won.
Trainer Tom Scully did not have a bob on her, and
how she became a favorite is hard to understand, as
the public generally waits for a stable lead. The
episode may mean a loss of a thousand pounds to
Bartle, who is Sam Hordern’s jockey and had lucra-
tive engagements ahead.

“Coorama”: The death of Mountain Prin-
cess (by Hymettus-Princess Beatrice) recalls that 15
years ago Princess Beatrice, with Mountain Prin-
cess at foot and also in foal to Hymettus, was
auctioned, and the
whole show knocked
down to big- Jim
Rice, of Yea (Vic.),
for 40 guineas. Among
her many victories
under Harry Mawby’s
colors were the
Heatherlie Handicap
and Caulfield and Lin-
lithgow Stakes, which
last was won easily
from that great sprin-
ter Sylvander and the
Derby winner Wolowa.
Her seconds in the
Newmarket Handicap
and Adelaide and
Williamstown Cups
were all creditable.
Rice had bad luck
with Mountain Prin-
cess at the stud. Her
first foal (by Maza-
g'an) died ; the second
(by Bobadil) could
not be trained because
of a bad temper.
There is another, by
All Black, which looks
the goods, but has not
yet been put into
training.

Notwithstanding a 50 per cent, increase in
the prices of admission, over -10,000 paid on Satur-
day at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to view the
first League semi-final, between Geelong and Rich-
mond. It is seven years since Geelong have been
m the “finals,” and on Saturday’s showing they are
unlikely to get there for seven more. The S'easiders
strove hard and worked well, but time after time
Richmond s wing men on either side would race
down, the line, punching and stab-kicking the ball
from one to another while following it up, then send-
ing it straight to a waiting and often unguarded
forward, who drove it through. The Pivotonians
were earnest, capable and determined, blit their
lack or method was heartbreaking, and they ended
up with but 54 points to the Tigers’ 115, Cliff
Rankin, Hagger, Sharia nd and others are great
players individually, but more is wanted to win a
League premiership. For the Tigers, Bayliss kicked
five hard goals and missed as many easy ones, bald-
headed Clarry Hall and Don juggled with the ball
like wizards, and Thorpe, full back, saved many
a goal by his resourcefulness and certainty of direc-
tion. After half-time the monotony of Richmond’s
scoring was only relieved by a couple of lively mills
among the spectators.
Over on the East Melbourne ground some 22,000
excited partisans handed in £570 to watch Port
demolish Williamstown, in the Ass. semi-final.
’Town had only just squeezed into “the four,”
whereas Port were almost level with ’Scray, the
leaders; but it wasn’t Port’s day out, and once
’Town got a. lead they stuck to it, winning ulti-
mately by 101 points to Port’s 75. Towards the
close quite a lot of barrackers were handing it out
to one another, one unfortunate' sustaining a wood-
ener that sent him unconscious to hospital.
* * * *
The “Kangaroos” licked Keightley last
week by 29 points (7 tries, four of which were
converted by Rex Norman’s clever left), to Keight-
ley’s nil. Burge, in the absence of Cubitt and
Fraser, acted as skipper. Keightley finished with
only 11 men. Their ground is too small for Rugby,,
being but 86yds. long and 05yds. wide, and
the resultant crowding of the players has been
responsible for many accidents.
The match with Hull Kingston Rovers, who topped
the Northern Union’s competition table last sea-
son, was expected to provide a stirring struggle, but
the ’Roos, fielding an all-N.S.W. XHI, with Burge
in command, had an easy win. The final figures
were 26 to 0. Ilorder notched three magnificent
tries iu the second half, from two of which Rex -
Norman goaled. Schultz, the Balmain rueker, was
given his marching orders early in the second half ;
and the Hull scrummy being skittled and off, both
XIII’s finished the struggle with 12 players. A
crowd of 10,000 watched the slaughter.

Two Sydney Soccer finals —the Metrop.
premiership and the State championship—drew a
record crowd of 3000 to Wentworth Oval on Satur-
day. Pyrmont, First Division winners, outed Bal-
main Gladstones by 3 goals to 1. Granville were
without Jennings—injured the previous week. Had
he played the result might have been different. West
tV'allsend won their game 8-1. Dick Sneddon, the
skipper, has been trying to lift a Gardiner Cup
medal for 12 years.
Wellington is on top in M.L. Rugby this
season. The Springboks licked them 8-3, but they
downed N.S’.W. (16 —8), and they wrested the Ranfurly
Shield from Southland (holders) by 28—13. Last
week Auckland was repulsed 27—19, and Otago fell
on Saturday by 13—8. The Shield has been struggled
for since 1902. Auckland has lifted it 10 times
Wellington eight and Taranaki and Southland once’
each.
* * * *
The Springboks left Sydney for S’Africn
by the Ulysses on Monday. Their manager in an
interview repeated his charges of rough piav acraimr
the N.S.W. side, especially in the third Test
A.ll things considered, the past season, from a Rugbv
Union standpoint, was not a success. Apart from
the crowds drawn to the Test matches between the
Maorilanders and the S’Africans, the enthusiasm for
the game was slight. It is dying at the hands of
the League.
Under Australian Rules at Sydney on
Saturday a Victorian 18 downed N.S.W. by 17 o- o ai s
19 behinds (121) to 11 goals 9 belnnds (7jp
N.S.W. held the invaders in the first quarter, and
led at the bell by 29—21. Then Victoria, passiiw
with methodical accuracy, and exploiting toe wing
forged ahead, leading at half-time by 65—36, ami
at the three-quarter bell by 92 —69. In the’ final
term N.S.W. faded out altogether. Victoria won
through heady kicking and safe marking. m
ground work there was little between the teams. JI.
Moyes (St. liilda), Carl Willis (South Melb.), ami
veterans G. Rattray (Fitzroy) and W. H. Kickc
(captain) were the pick of the winners. N.S.W.’s
best were L. Lobb, A. Gilmore and V. McCann.
Tommy O’Brien, newly arrived from Los
Angeles, climbed into the ring at Sydney Stadium
on Saturday night to prove himself upon the veteran
Jimmy Hill. For three rounds he moved about
busily on pink stilts growing out of emerald-green
pants, and during that period he showed even
known method of failing to strike the human jaw.
It was felt that should he connect the jaw would
go, if not the head, such was the vigor lie put into
his swipes. The theorists were wrong. in round
four Hill collected one of the Yank’s pile-driving
blows and subsided for eight. Then lie got up and
stopped another, rose and was in Dreamland under the
spell of a: third when the gong went, and Joe Wallis
did the right thing. The winner relies solely on „
terrific right, which apparently must be applied
early in the evening, since it seems an impossibility
that such legs should support their owner for the
full 20 rounds. Nor is the hit such a lethal affair
as it looks. It has not a tithe of the stopping-
power of Godfrey’s famous sleep-producer, for
example. Still, the public took to O’Brien aid
should attend his next display in force.
» * » *
Bert Spargo, the Victorian fedder, has
had two fights on successive Saturdays, and in
each case he was declared the winner on a foul.
The first was at the Sydney Stadium against the
Yankee Goozeman; the second at the .Melbourne
temple of stoush'against Jerry Sullivan, and when
the referee waved Sullivan away in the ninth round
lie ruined an interesting scrap. It wasn’t a bad
breach as breaches go, and was plainly unintentional,
and a wiser man than Quirk would have sent the
lads to their corners until Spargo had recovered, in
accordance with the coinmonsense precedent estate
lished in the Olahby-Burns mill. For once the sym-
pathy of the crowd was all with the Sydney lad.
He had fought a desperate battle against a cleverer
and more experienced man, and might have worn
him down had the third man allowed it to go on.

The sailing season opened on Sydney Har-
bor last Saturday in ideal weather.' Six clubs
staged races. The principal event was Sydney Flying
Squadron’s 18ft. Handicap. Twenty faced the
starter, and the two heats were annexed by Bri-
tannia (Geo. Robinson), -|min., and Mavis (Horace
Rod>i*k), ljmin. There were 12 in the final, in
which Golding brought the flag down with 52secs.
to spare from Mavis, which headed the new boat
by 62sec. Mona was fourth, 30secs. further away,
followed by Keriki and Florrie. Advance whipped in.

At Sydney Grammar School champion-
pionships last week F. W. Bayldon won 220yds.
(23 3-ssec.), 440yds. (53sec.), and was second to 11.
L. McDonald in 100yds. and 880yds. The only record
was C- P. Hayden’s junior high jump (sft. lJin.).
11. W. Newman, the cricket and football star, took
the senior championship at Newington with firsts in
broad jump (20ft. 2-iin.), 220yds. (24 4-ssec.),
440yds. (55 4-ssec.), seconds in 100yds., 880yds. and
mile, and fourth in 121 b. shot and 120yds. hurdles.
At St. Joseph’s, ,1. Hogan’s senior cup-win comprised
first in 220yds. (24 2-ssec.), 440yds. (55 9-10 sec.),
88O3MS. (2niin. 18 l-osec.), shot-putt (29ft. 7-Jin.)
and third in 100yds.
- The handicappers gave the hack-markers
no show in the 20-mile N.S.W. League of Wheelmen
road race at Enfield (Sydney) on Saturday. Veteran
Dick Munro (scr.) got fastest time (66min. 10
2-ssee.), and the winner was Ft Gotlev (6min.
30sec.).

The Melbourne tennis premiership went
to M. 0.0. on Saturday, South Yarra scoring only one
rubber, that through the vigorous, wristv work of
Sandral against Taylor, the scores being fr—3, 6—3.
Wertheim, the M. 0.0. giant, had a tough proposi-
tion in Fairley, whose superiority in close volleying
and overhead piled up the points, despite the embar-
rassing effects of Wertheim’s backhand, cut. Wer-
theim took the first set, 7 —5, but lost ; the second,
3 6, and in the decisive round was I—4, then
2 -5, with every prospect of going- clown. But he
made a spectacular recovery, and playing tennis of
high standard captured five fast games in succes-
sion. Down (M.C.C.) was businesslike in routing
Hawthorn (6 —2, 6 —4), but Patterson struck oppo-
sition in O’Hara Wood. The big fellow had 6 —4 in
his favor in the first hand, but the board read
11 9 before Wood surrendered in the second. Wood
led at 3 —o, then bv a mighty effort Patterson
evened at 4—4, and they took alternate games up to
9 9, when Wood tired and lost his punch.
* * * *
The current suspicion that J. O. Anderson
is a world-beater in the making was supported on
Monday, by his defeat o’f William T. Tilden in the
Fast v West tournament at Chicago. Losing the
first set (3 — 6), the Australian won the next two
(6 —4, 6 —l) and was skittled in the fourth (1 — 6).
F’ollowed the set of the season and one of the most
giruelling in the history of tennis. Each in turn
looked a sure winner, and when Tilden led at
the 29th game the less experienced man seemed to
be “sent for.” But at that critical moment he
displayed his rarest skill, and rallying, splendidly
he won the 36th game (19 —17) and the match.
Now if Johnson hadn’t beaten him- in that semi-
final !
THE CONTROVERSIALISTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Criticism is raging in the English press, includ-
ing strictures by Colonel Jackson, Hobbs, Mr. Toone
and Lord Harris, over Armstrong’s aspersions on
England’s professional cricketers.”
When cricket champions stoop to blither,
As most of them are prone to do,
And argue of_ the why and whither,
And what is what, and who is who,
They never seem to dam the torrent
Of, words which rival sportsmen flay
By musing that this game abhorrent
Is one that two or more can play.
And so we get sententious Fenders
Denouncing umpires by and large;
Wilson and other cable-senders
Each with his own offensive charge,
Which earns a furious denial
Compact of fierce rebukes and sneers,
And puts the game upon its trial,
And sets an Empire by the ears.
How splendid if in Test-match cricket
A law prevailed that no one broke;
And as in golf, so at the wicket
No player talked upon the stroke;
While to preclude post-mortem fighting
’Twould clearly be a benefit
If Armstrong’s sort were barred from skiting
Both on the stroke and after it.

The Jubilee Show was like every other
Show, only more so. Cartloads of brand-
new garden seats helped the Country to rest
its hard-worn feet at intervals, and they
were nearly as comfortable as the Post
Olface steps. The landscape was cheered by
numerous extra tea-kiosks, and these were
quite dainty. A pattern had been taken
from the palm-shaded members’ quarters, and
green fronds veiled the feeders from the in-
evitable dust. Dinkie-di pavements with
kerbstones and tiled gutters took the place
of former mud tracks, and the awful cinder
paths are now ancient history. A papier-
mhche model of the whole grounds spread
on a high platform near the entrance was
an inspiration, and it saved Dad and Mum
many_ purposeless peregrinations; likewise
the city folk when they wanted to find the
stump-jumping Durhams or the crossbred
harvesters.
Judging Day was icy-bleak and horribly
wet, yet. on the morrow the Governor said
the opening piece in whirling clouds of dust.
He and the President wore silk top-hats and
clothes to match those atrocities, and got
scorched in consequence. Lady Stradbroke
wore a brown great coat and a huge tomato-
colored feather hat like a parasol. She made
the painful discovery that her duties included
walking miles over the boggy Oval and other
miles around dusty pavements. Two cream-
costumed daughters brought up a lagging
rear, unable to match the strides of papa,
mamma and the committee. Luncheon was
a long, ponderous affair of cold meats, hot
vegetables and tepid speeches. Premier Law-
son came out to it and talked to the Country
party.
We had three Governors at the Show.
Our own Earl did the opening, and on the
following day the G.-G. and his Agricultural
Ex. of S. Aus. had an innings. Politicians’
visits were also extended over two days.
Premier Lawson platitudinised at one
luncheon and Jocook at the other. Strad-
broke was as hospitable as Stonington
allowed in the matter of dinner-parties to
people more or less identified with pastoral
pursuits, politics and officialdom.
Governor Weigall, of S. Aus., accom-
panied by her Ex. and Priscilla, their house-
doctor, C. F. Williams, and a gent.-help or
two, came over to the Show. They put up
at Government House and said “How-do?”
to Lord Northcliffe before returning to Adel-
aide.
Clara. Butt, a campanile of silver and lace,
with a jewelled diadem on her raven tresses,
sang to a tumultuous congregation at the
Town Hall on Saturday. The G.-G. and
Lady Forster, with Lady Stradbroke and
staff, made a crescent of interested listeners
close to the platform, and the contralto and
her supports saved up their best salaams for
the vice-regal squad. Mrs. Geoff Syme and
droves of Taits were also close up, and must
have caught some of the Dame’s sotto voce
patter with her pianist, Grace Torrens, who
wore her fair thatch like a pre-Raphaelite
goddess and arrested the roving eye with bril-
liant purple effects. Towards the end of the
evening the Butt had her house roaring with
her through “The Land of Hope and Glory,”
and, challenged by the organ and her informal
chorus, she easily raised her voice above the
uproar.
The other dav the Stork brought Gent.-help
Digby and his lady- a new" daughter down the
chimney of the bungalow in the vice-regal
grounds. The infant’s sex is a tragic blow.
Gov. Stradbroke is short of gent.-helps.
There have been no advts. in the papers yet,
but tenders have been called for in the most
select military circles.
Another contingent of the Stradbroke
family has reached Melbourne. Two school-
boy sons of the Earl arrived by the Nestor.
Some ’Varsity Con. students had an ordeal
last week. They gave a concert in the
Town Hall, and Melba appeared with the
Governor’s party and sat in the very front
seats. Laver hovered about like a hen with
chicks, and was wogfully disappointed wheq
a star student’s voice got smothered in terror.
“How could I think of my throat,” wailed
the youth, “when all I knew was that my
knees were knocking together?”
There will be a special party and meeting
of the Friendly Union of Soldiers’ Wives
and Mothers at Government House on
October 7. Lady Forster is taking up the
running of Lady Helen in this association
The property bought by Sydney Strft to
house its Melbourne venture is the bomb

ments when the association appealed for
£100,00(4 —-and collected £71,000 —for up-to-
date premises. But the Y. bought Hoyt’s
picture building, owned by Jas. Moore, the
timber man, over the Yarra, and parted with
the Flinders-street proposition to the Sun
for £40,000. As a bit towards the new
Y.M.C.A. Herbert Sargood, the softgoods
magnate, and his wife passed along a cheque
for £5OOO.
Myer’s Ball in the St. Kilda Town Hall
last week was a brilliant affair. Close on
a thousand employees were at the whirl and
hundreds of pretty girls turned out in the
perfection of chiffon mannequin frocks. One
poor little Cinderella was the exception. She
languished among the wallflowers in a dingy
black frock, but wore the most wonderful
little pink brocaded slippers. Tliefe whs
some hidden tragedy there. Hid her party-
frock get ldst, or. was it one of the new tight
sheaths that split at the last moment? What-
ever it was, she refused consolation and
dances, and sat with her little pink-silk toes
together and hopeless woe in her face. A
whole army of committee men was led by
M.C. Ormonde Baker and his aide, Miss
•Maxwell, and a gorgeous supper was trimmed
with oyster patties and punch bowls. McCal-
lUm Neil, of the Firm, with his wife in
black and silver, helped in the entertain-
ment, and Myer himself, groomed to the
last degree of New York perfection, was in
quite royal state on a carpeted lounge under
the balcony. The very beautiful Mrs. Myer
—it was a Reno wedding, you remember—
showed glowing shoulders above a dfelieate
tracing of fine black lace, and her sister,
Miss Baillieu, was in pink shot with silver.
TiJe Mayoress had a reception in her Town
Hall boudoir rooms to welcome the Etiripi-
dean Spinney lady. Artist Lambert came
in the palest of grey togs, and was the only
man in sight except our large Gaud Mayor.
Miss Spinney wore a lot of Spring-like greens
in her clothes, hugged a pink-rose horseshoe
and made musical exclamations of delight
about the peach and almond blossom which
decorated the rooms.
Dorothea Spinney and Una Bourne are
bracketed as guests of honor at the Lyceum
Club for October 13. They are to be fed as
well as the club can do it at a dinner from
which men, cigars, smoke-room yarns and
anything with a fillip in it will be rigidly
barred. A pity, in a way, for both distin-
guished artists are of the cold, classical type,
and it would be interesting to see how they
would respond to any warming-up.
The Three A.’s —Australian Art Associa-
tion—had a tea-party at the Fine Art Gal-
lery while its show was on. The Governor
was a guest, and he put in a couple of hours
or more looking at pictures and confabbing
with interesting folk. Lady Stradbroke, a
picture in black-and-white, came later with
Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who dressed in woolly
artistic shades of Autumn brown. Melba
arrived with Longstaff (he is to paint her
portrait, by the way). The Dame wore soft
blue togs and a tricky little black hat, while
the incomparable feet were clad in blue
grey suede and silk (the portraitist really
must include those feet). Bernard Hall
talked intense Art with the Most Important.
Mrs. Geoff Syme, in cool Spring-like white-
and-black, caused a scarlet tag or two to
appear on the canvases. Northcliffe’s pur-
chases were proudly labelled and surged
around.
In the intervals of scraping inquisitive
tourists off his front fence at Toolangi, C. J.
Dennis has been busy with pen and pencil.
He has just finished
“A Book for Kids,”
dedicated to the
children of all ages,
and containing some
of his first efforts
in drawing, which
challenge in their
humor the colored
:itle-page and frontis-
piece by his old
friend Hal Gye.
The latter artist,
however, supplies all
the illustrations for
another of Dennis’s
masterpieces, “Rose
of Spadger’s,” which
peeps into the rest-
less past of Bill
before he became the
Sentimental Bloke. Talking of the Bloke,
his versatile creator has dramatised him, and
he will appear on the stage at an early date.

Horace Gleeson, a former identity in this
city’s musical circles, but for some years
past at Invercargill (M.L.), sends news of
a healthy contract with Boosey and Co., of
London. lid lias made a hit with some
sbng compositions, apd “My Wee kittle Hut
bn the Hill” is the latest best-seller.
Delegates frbm the Australian and Maori-
land Masonic Grand Lodges are to assemble
here in November to talk keystones, com-
passes and other symbolic mysteries. Inci-
dentally, there will be some festivity, with
Bro. Stradbroke as a principal guest. Ilrck-
ford, the G.M., intends to push further an
idea of his that British Bmpire members of
the craft should have a corroboree in Lon-
don.
Racing-man Mills never knows quite what
he will strike when he motors with his wife.
Last week, when coming from Maffra, he
found the car packed with eggs. The chooks
at Powerscourt had been particularly gener-
ous, and Mrs. Bountiful brought dozens and
dozens along and took them round to the
various hospitals, together with a few dressed
chickens. The hospitals appreciate such
thought these hard times.
Some tobacconists have struck a brilliant
idea; They are putting scarlet-tipped cigar-
ettes oh the market, and the women hre rush-
ing the pretty things. The tips don’t give
away the secret of Sassiety’s pomegranate
lips.
Pianist Doris Hadden has fingered her
way successfully through competitions to
become one of the charmers of the keyboard.
She 8 has a
trophies—o n e of
them the silver medal
of tile Trinity Col-
lege, London—and
has appeared at vari-
ous municipal, Chap-
pell Ballad, and
Musical Society con-
certs in Melbourne,
On each occasion
the critics have said
hice things about
her with flattering
Unanimity. Doris,
Who is shortly cross-
ing the Straits to

e-litters ’on thp qtnff
of the Albert-street
Conservatoriuin, where one of her pupils has
lately won a scholarship. Incidentally, she
was born at Williamstown, and it was
Edouard Seharf who taught her fingers
the way they should go among the keys.
Adelaide’s dear old ex-Professor Watson,
whose quaint speeches have been the delight
of his city for a whole generation, has been
giving evidence in a Melbourne will-suit.
The great surgeon, happening to be in Vic-
toria, went to see an old friend who was ill,
and had a consultation with two other doc-
tors there. Then he returned to the sick-
room :—•
I said: “Tommy, I’ve come to bid you good-bye.
I am going to the East myself, and I’ll never see
you again, because I don’t think you’ll live very
long. Your, time on earth is brief,” (1. don’t know
whether those were the actual words, but that was
the effect of them.) He took it splendidly. He
didn’t seem, to believe me; I had told him the same
before, and he had recovered. He asked how long
he had to live. I said: “Not many days, Tommy.”
The doctors said not many months ; I thought I would
stir him up, so I cut it down a bit,
Just so did Peter Doody, of “The Arca-
dians,” describe his che6ring-up of a sick
friend: “I said to him, ‘Stuart, old man’ —
his name was Percy, really, but I had to say
something to brighten him up” (Tom Walls
used to alter the names every night, to fit
any of his sporting friends he saw in the
stalls), “‘your number’s up, old chap.
You’re a goner,’ I said.”
Mrs. Pat Osborne, over for the Show, has,
with Mrs. Baiilieu, been plotting surprise-
parties for their sister Lesley Madden.
There are to be jade-green teas and blue
luncheons and rose-pink morning teas for
the bride-to-be. Mrs. Robert Kennedy has
planned a linen tea for this Thursday, and
some of the guests have been working at
eyelet-holes and such mysteries for weeks.
Lesley is, of course, an expert, and the etcet-
eras ' she has fashioned for herself are won-
derful.
There was a foregathering of doctors’
wives at a luncheon party at the Occidental
in Show-week. Mrs. Zwar hostessed the
affair, and the Syme, Stawell and Kent
Hughes dames were there to meet Mrs. Clen-
dinnen, Mrs. Shaw and Mrs. Stevens.
Little Oreste Manxoni, who makes plea-
sant sounds upon the mandolin, is next in
line for a benefit concert. Mrs. Hodges,
Mrs. Stein and other dames are fixing it for
October 31-
'l'oorak flappers are thrilled to the. marrow
by 18-year-old Mary Mills’s engagement to
Malcolm Maslin, eldest hope of the wool-
growing Maslins, of Urana (N.S.W.). Miss
Mary, who is a most attractive young
thing, is the elder of the Ainslie Mills trio
of daughters and a grand-daughter of the
late Col. Tom Price. Early this year she
was to have tracked across seas to peep at
Mayfair’s social whirl from under the wing
of her mother’s aunt, the Hon. Mrs. Wil-
liam Cavendish, once Lizzie Baillie, a Toorak
belle of the ’eighties, whose brother inherited
the family baronetcy.
Newly-widowed Senator George Fairbairii
is now hurrying across seas in answer to a
cable that his daughter Alison (Mrs. Bal-
main), who was on the sick-list for some
weeks after her arrival in the Cold Country,
is again ill.
Toorak is looking forward to an affair on
September 30 that ought to something
like the magic forest scene from “Macbeth,”
where the warriors advance carrying Arees,
etc. Our Countess has asked the Mattie
Day League to come to Stonington on that
day, bringing as many kinds of wattle-trees
as they can lay their hands on, and plant
them about the vice-regal cabbage-patch.
On reading the wail of the twopenny
daily critic that she could no longer hit the
topmost note with her original accuracy,
Dame Nellie snorted fiercely: “Good Lord,
as if I didn’t know that better than the
Wretched critic does!” And perhaps she did.
But no doubt the wretched critic has a
reader or two besides Dame Nellie.
Nellie Billings, who for a brief time we
knew as Mrs. Malddn Robb, has come back
among the Melbourne music-makers in her
widowhood. Billed as Madame Nellie Bil-
lings, she gave a concert at the Assembly
Hall the other night, with Violet Somerset
to help her with some sweet warbling.
While Adelaide thinks of it: —
The big prize distribution in connection with the
Mayoress’s appeal for the Children’s Hospital
passed off without bloodshed; but it meant a fear-
some crush. One young man received a large loaf
of bread and a baby’s feeding-bottle when he p;e-
sented his tickets, and a huge gramophone was won
by a small boy who had to get a conveyance to
take it home. Soap and small-tooth combs were
distributed in such hundreds that by Sunday the
community generally should be a credit to the State.
Amid all the echoes of the Big War the memories
of the boys who went west in that other little affair
in South Africa a score of years back are kept green,
A few days ago the annual memorial service was
held at the soldiers’ monument, North Terrace, A
big muster of men who had served on the veldt, his
Ex. and all the available Brass-hats combined to
make it a most impressive affair..
And, talking of war echoes, Glenelg has plunged
head-first into a wild whirl of social festivities in
an enthusiastic effort to raise funds for the local
war memorial, and much of its beauty-sleep is being
mortgaged to dances, bridge and euchre parties. A
children’s ball is the latest inspiration, and tickets
are going faster than the local train. When the
Glenelg woman gets into her top organising gear
something shifts.
The community sing-song is a trump-card in
this little town at present. The most popular
vaudeville artist is the one who sits back and lets
the audience bellow the melody for him. Melba had
better cut the “Home, Sweet Home” encore, or the.
house will sing all night. Adelaide audiences simply
can’t help : it. The weekly lunch-hour sing-songs
at the Town Hall are crowded out. There munching
and melody go hand-in-hand, and “One more Ribber
to Cross” rendered through a beef-roll becomes a
notable circumstance.
His Ex. has just been re-elected president of the
S.A. Bowling Assoc., and has signalised the fact by
giving £lOO towards the expenses of the forth-
coming big'iinter-State eorrobOree,
The poor old Palais Royal concluded its terpsi-
Chorean career with a “Won’t-go-home-till-rnorn-
ing” razzle. It is quite on the cards that the fair
sex will extend their patronage to it as a Stadium.
The Adelaide flapper is full of possibilities.
We are at present in the midst of a super-dose
of music. The Lherniavskys, Dame Nellie and Dame
Clara are following one another in quick, melodious
succession. And in the middle of it all comes
Eugenie Scott’s invitation vocal recital at the Lady
Colton Hall. This latter event, which is to he
under vice-regal and mayoral patronage, will actually
clash with one of the Cherniavsky concerts, a fact
that will put the fair Eugenie’s friends to a severe
test.
And still more music. The other afternoon the
Kidman lady said the opening piece for a home-made
f?tc at the Adelaide Girls’ club, King William-street,
to raise money to buy a piano. The shopgirl and the
young business woman find this club a boon and a
blessing, but they won’t be thoroughly happy tili
they ,get a piano, and now they won’t be long.
Amany active years Mrs. Blythen
lias returned to live with her daughter in
Ballarat. She was born there —her maiden
name was Ellen Blackburn —on December 1,
jS.II, and proudly claims to have been the
first white girl born, on the diggings.
A note on artists’ methods:—
George Lambert’s pencil sketches, a number of
which he has included in his exhibitions here, are
the most charming things of their kind. Many
quite excellent painters make very indifferent pencil
sketches; and black-and-white men who might be
expected to excel in this department do not often
produce preliminary sketches that have any artistic
value. Hans Heysen’s drawings of sheep and tur-
*keys are fine, but Lambert’s sketches in this medium
are exquisite, and the Melbourne selector showed
excellent judgment in securing samples for the
Vic. National Gallery. As a source of pure de-
light, I found several of his pencil heads far more
prolific than his “Important People.” But, alas.'
even these simple things, with Lambert’s name
attached, command ijrices that make them inac-
cessible to the comparatively' impecunious.

REACHING THE CORE OF
IN its relation to the national needs
and desires* both real and imag-
ined, the fruly great Australian Store
reaches the co'fe of things vital and
finds its most important work the
privilege <?f counsel and guidance.
~ Standing foursquare to the world
it must be habituaily faithful to a fixed
and sincere purpose to serve dnd sferve
well through strength, performance
and high endeavour, moulding the
charader of men, merchandise and
events, and interpreting these things
in the interest of the nation.
It is not the privilege of sucfi a
store to yield to the clamour of events
which sometimes make for ill advised
purpose, purchase and gain; rather it
must stand unmindful of such cajol-
ery, adhering steadfastly fo its open
and avowed policy.
A'store,* keeping an open mind,
true to its purpose and sincere even
in its smallest efforts, can and does
contribute much to the nation’s real
lif<% enriching the sound principles
of truth, sincerity and general well-
being of all i^serves.

At any rate, we know a little more about,
bubonic than we did last time it got itself
•smuggled into Sydney. The great thing is
that it isn't borne on the wings of the
breeze. A flea has to be the bearer; and
the flea has previously to have been on too
friendly terms with a rat. Every rat must i
fall under suspicion while there is a bubonic
flea left in the country ; and the only wise
housewife is the housewife who offers no en-
couragement for a rat to remain on her
premises—and there’s no visitor who can
better take a hint that he isn’t wanted.
Don’t worry yourself; worry the rats. Keep
cool and keep clean.
The final week of the appeal for the
State Orchestra is now half-way through,
and although cheques are coming in by every
mail, still the necessary thousands’ aren’t
quite collected. Melbourne has paid up its
quota and is sitting back smugly watching
to see whether neighbor N. S. Wales drops
her proportion into the plate. That the
orchestra has done much to musically edu-
cate Sydney there can be no doubt’ what-
ever, and, apart from everything else, it isn’t
fair to the young musical student to allow
it to be disbanded. We support chairs of
medicine and science and iaw. and the-boy
and the girl who make music' the big life-
work are entitled to a chance of the higher
education in their own country. If they
can’t get it there only the well-to-do can get
it at all.
The bare shoulders of fair women shone
liouri-like through the haze at the Society
of Artists’ show the other night, when for
tne first time in its annals the society added
female adornment to its smoke-oh. From
the issue of the cards whereon it was stated
openly, that dress was optional, everybody
knew it, was going to be a wild party; but
when the night arrived even the most perfect
Tenus and Apollo among the guests had not
been brave enough to decline the option. The
lucky early-comers had secured the little
tables down two sides of the big gallery and
were gallantly rafßsh, as such a Bohemian
night called for —one lady even smoked! The
Adrian Knox knight and his lady looked in
for half-amhour; and Mrs. Bertie Kelly
brought a peacock-blue brocade frock and
her youngest daughter. President Sydney
Ure Smith looked like a grown-up Glaxo
baby; Andy Watt, K.C., stood at the top
of the room like a substantial Bill of Costs ;
Marsden, director of Anthony Horderns’
Gallery, was there with Mrs. Marsden, who
wore one of the handsomest evening coats
in the room. Isla Blomfield mused with a
sanitary-inspector’s eye over the infant in
Lambert’s picture. Lou Stone, author of
“Jonah” and “Betty Wayside” and other
bits of real Australia, brought Mrs. Lou.
Florence Rodway, who last year was the
only serp—that is to say, Eve in the nicotine
grove, trailed a silver scarf over black dra-
peries. Tall Ruby Board glowed like an
emerald; the Czecho-Slavic Df. Danes and
a slim dark wife in pale grey radiated an
atmosphere of sparkling intelligence. Sin-
clair Gillies studied the anatomy of the
Norman Lindsay damsels on the wall; and
when the temperature raced up to fever heat
under the play of wit and temperament
Henry Penn cooled down the hectic flush
by a spray of crystal piano notes.
The grounds of the Women’s College were
mulled to just the right degree of heat for
the fete to aid the extension fund. The
present buildings of pleasantly-mellowed
brick blinked at the gay awnings over the
stalls that had sprung up between their old
neighbors the trees and hedges. Girl, stu-
dents, mostly with bobbed heads, sold you
postcards or flowers or kcwpie-dolls if you
couldn’t think of an excuse quick enough;
and Mick Ricardo, in a knee-length small-
girl frock of yellow, presided over the "three
shies for 6d.” stall, where small girls' and
boys clustered eagerly; there were slides
for the children, and tennis tournaments lor
the agile. Midway through the afternoon’s
business Dame Margaret, in a dress that in :
the September sunlight shone like cloth of.
gold, passed up the college steps'between a
sort of “Princess Ida” guard, and said that
the f£te was open, while the uncapped heads
of the girls shone like silk and burnished
copper in the high lights. In the dining-hall,
dimly lit and heavy with scents of the flowers
in the arms of most of the audience, with
sunlight and greenery thrusting beckon-
ing fingers through an open window,
Chopin dripped honev sweet from Arthur
Benjamin’s, fingers ; and Mrs. Allard inter-
preted Rubinstein and Landon Ronald. Evi-
dently the lads were holding themselves off
foi the dance in the evening, for never was
there an afternoon fete so beggared of men.
-Lhe discussion of the neatest way to bind
a severed artery has led many an undergrad,
maid to the discovery of the lad whose jazz-
step rhymes with her own. This was a self-
evident fact at the girl undergrade.’ dance last
week, W hen the Paddington Town Hall was
nlied with silk-legged, short-kilted lasses —
a set of round-faced baby-cherubs whom
learning must have overtaken with their milk
teeth. _ Miss Williams, of the Women’s Col-
ln soft black silk, had her feet upon
the Llniperone'.s Carpet, and with her was
good-looking Mrs. Grogan, who kept a mater-
nal eye on her auburn-haired medical chick
Kathleen. French-lecturer Gladys Marks
Wore primrose that was openly adored by the
student-girl. Sheila McKay combined secre-
tarial efficiency and smart dressing. Scal-
loped and petalled skirts were everywhere,
>and one girl looked as though she had stolen'
two lengths of daffodil sky from Tennyson,
scattered purple pansies over it. draped it
with the same royal tone of tulle and called
it the perfect jazz-frock. There was a
fuchsia maiden, too, all cerise and violet
tulle; and Delia Coppola in pale-blue silk net
and rosebuds was an embodiment of Men-
delssohn’s Spring Song.
The Uni. flutter of the past two weeks
finished up with the Sports Union dance last
knda.v night in the Paddington Town Hall,
lhe Sports Union dance always nets the big
hsh in the University swim, as well as the
young mackerel. The Warden, H. E. Barff,
blessed the gathering; the Tasman Lovells
disported under the blue-and-gold decora-
tions ; and professors and doctors were as
thick as thieves in Vallombrosa or Surry
lulls. Among the dancers was the newly-
engaged Mary Bridge, with her pretty head
of golden curls and violet-blue eyes; Nita
Lindeman might have been the spirit of the
grape in her mauve satin and gold tissue
frock .that;bore a promising crop of golden
grapes ; Mrs. Curtis, ’in black satin, chaper -
oned a pink-netted daughter, and the smart
Wheeler girl wore a lace overdress covering-
soft pjnk satin.
The lUferview Old Boys held the Went-
worth floor in the interests of the river col-
lege’s Memorial Chapel one night last week,
and all the smart younger R.C. set turned
up to make the dance one of the jolliest of
the season. T. J. Walton was president
and Mrs. T. J. upheld husband’s station in
handsome white satin and tulle and opales-
cence. Mrs. McElhone mixed Spanish lace
and black velvet with the happiest results;
the Coyle boys looked after pretty sister
Margot, who was Pompadourish in floral
brocade and a beauty patch ; Sheilagh Foy’s
dress of flame-colored velvet and silver tissue
flashed through the dance like some tropical
butterfly. Hector Father O’Dwyer was among
the chaperones, and Dorothy Coffee wore a
ribbon rainbow on her black tulle frock.
This is the beautiful head of Hazel Philp,
who won the soprano championship at the
Lismore Musical Festival the other day ; and
as everybody knows,
that is quite a hall-
mark, for f asm ore is
one of the places in
Australia where
music is regarded as
essential to the
country’s welfare.'
Hazel studied under
Leonard Francis, the
well-known Queens-
land choir - master,
and later under Aida
Kdwards, at on e
time a noted iigure
in Sydney, musical
circles. ,T. A. Philp,
one of the oldest of
Bulletin contribu-
tors, and in spare
hours editor of the
lirst Chinese paper in Sydney, is the song-
bird w male parent. J.A. has been for many
y ears on the staff of the Brisbane Coukiek ;
he is the writer of “Some Bulletin Stories”
and Jingles That Jangle.” Bernice Agar,
who made this photograph, says Hazel owns
one of the most beautiful profiles that her
camera has ever recorded.
Last week when the Feminist Club was
entertaining Clara Butt and Kennerley
Rumford, the doorway of the Cavalier where
the meats were spread looked like a riot or
a bargain sale. A restless sea of women
surged about the footpath, meeting and greet-
ing, or rushing madly up and down the
stairs to see what had become of Winifred or
Joan. The doorkeeper might have given a
hint or two to St. Peter himself in the mat-
ter of handling a rush of female saints half
of whom had mislaid their checks or left
them at home, or were to collect them from
someone already seated amidst the Blessed.
Mercifully the guests of honor were detained,
so the uttermost Feminist was duly seated
when the Dame (in white satin and pearls
and a black cloak) and Kennerley (in the
usual display of male haberdashery) arrived
on the mat. In due time came the speeches
and “matrix of the world to be” was one
shell of oratory tired at the principal guest’s
head. The Feminist colors, blue and gold,
were prettily carried out. in blue lupins and
wattle. President Miss Prestan-Stanley
and Ruby Rich supported each other at the
high places, and one or two waiters, worked
up by the speechmaking, pitched their vocal
weight into •‘For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow.”
All Saints Church, Woollahra, saw one
ot the quiet knot-tyings of last week, when
Eelle Sloane, of Woorilla, Young, and of
Glensprae, Woollahra, became Mrs. Robert
Innes Kay, Robert Innes being a son of
i adre Kay, and a young man who once
wrote excellent undergraduate verse. The
usual satin souffle frothed about the bride;
and Jessie Kay and Bertha Sloane con-
trasted pink and blue brocade in their brides-
maid frocks. Bride’s mother- entertained
the wedding guests at Glensprae.
Here is Tesla’s picture of Marsh Little,
smger and composer, who was tendered a
testimoni® l concert at the Town Hall on the
i i« . rn , Jlt Mudgee; and educated at
rJlacklriars, Sydney, for a number of years
lie worked as a soloist and organiser for the
Sydney City Mission,
in whose philan-
thropic work he is
intensely interested.
He went to London
with the Chapman-
Alexander mission,
worked at Mile End-
road, and on leaving
was fare'welled by
thousands of waifs
and strays of the
London slums—the
most touching inci-
dent in his life. A
devoted .son, he left
England on the eve
of his debut on the
Gibbons vaudeville
circuit on account of
his mothe r’s ill-
health. ‘Boys of the Dardanelles” is his
best-known composition, but there is a long-
list ot popular successes to his name. AVhilst
abroad Little sang at Chappell’s ballad con-
as well as for Edison-Bell records and
i- cltilG Co.
Young musician Rex de Cairos-Rego, son
of the Telegraph’s music critic, chose one
night last week to marry his Nancy
Wormald. Ins de Cairos-Rego and Dorothy
H ormald, sisters of the parties of the first
and second parts, were bridesmaids, and Rex’s
cousin Clive Smith was best man. St.
i hilip s staged the ceremony.
There were two bigwigs at the farewell
dinner to Hugh Ward given by the American
1 iccadilly. One was Joseph Ward,
ot Maoriland, who made the principal
speech; and T. P. O’Connor, who gave a
12-mmutes talk full of magic oratory on
the entente between Britain and the U.S.A.
Mrs. J. D. Fitzgerald, who had been fore-
gathering in Switzerland with the three
sisters she had not met for 14 years, linked
up with her husband in London preparatory
to setting out to New York to visit the
prana-donna daughter, the son-in-law and
the baby; but at the last moment sickness
laid a detaining hand on J.D. Of Mrs. Fitz-
gerald’s sisters one is Mrs. Dickens, wife of
Henrv Fielding Dickens, K.C., Common
Sergeant of the City of London ; another is
Mrs. kritz Rosen, wife of the German
Foreign Minister, Dr. Rosen, who had an
English mother. Rosen was a great pet of
the Kaiser s, and stage-managed that ex-
monarch’s famous visit to Jerusalem in 1898.
The old monarchists are angry with him
for taking a place in a Republican Govern-
ment, but Rosen is very British in liis ten-
dencies and abhors Prussianism. The un-
married one of the four sisters is an artist.
xMary Laing-Meason drops a line from Cal-
cutta, then in the thick of the monsoons;
and the chief excitement of the moment was
the forming of an Australian-Maoriland
C lub. The name of the man who convened
the first meeting was Mclntosh, and this
letter will bet its new r hole-proofs that he
comes from Otago. Mary MacFarlane, so
long with the ill-starred .Eastern Tours,
Ltd., had just taken a new job with an Aus-
tralian firm in Hong Kong. She describes
Dawn (who, after advance-managing
for Warwick for about two years, has just
become his matrimonial partner) as the pos-
sessor of blue eyes, captivating ways, exqui-
site taste in dress and a super-knack of
roping in vice-regals for the firm’s enter-
tainments. Australian man Walter R. Ban-
vard, she says, is the most 'popular theatri-
cal man thereabouts to-day. A few weeks
ago, at the end of a big season, he allowed
the chorus girls of the company to give a
matinee for their own benefit, and the lucky
girls netted something over £4O each from
the afternoon. lan McLean, the baritone,
who used to win singing competitions in
Auckland, is one of Banvard’s company.
From “Vandorian” in London :—-
Lady King-Hall, wife of the Admiral who was so
sound in the matter of the Australian Navy, has
just had a novel accepted by Hutchinson’s. It’s said
to be very witty and full of vim. An earlier novel,
placed in Australian official circles, has not vet
found its way into the affections of the English
public. Life in Australia is not a fashionable
background; and the much-travelled King-Halls who
loved “Colonial” life, found they had a lot to learn
about the English attitude to overseas Dominions
when they returned to this side. The lady has
therefore “placed” her second novel in these mistv
isles.
The world is round but not so wide, after all.
In Bruges I spent many pleasant summer evenings
(a heat wave was just then frizzling old Europe)
with the Francis Chapmans, of Sydney, and their
only chick, the clever artist Evelyn, who has been
hung” this year, as last, in the Paris Salon. We
had the luck to sniff the canals in their sweetest
moments. In Brussels I stayed at a charming
French pension, where the Parisian lady at the
head of it asked about the John Lane Mullinses,
the Sydney people had stayed months in this pen-
sion in pre-war days. “Alas!” said Mdlle. Thevenet
“I have trembled to write to them and ask about
the fine young son Mon (lieu! C’est la guerre!
As for me, 1 fled to England when the Germans
came here. Is it permitted that I send my affec-
tionate sympathy to Monsieur and Madame?” So
I deliver the message from an adorable French-
woman in Brussels.
Here’s a piece of nice discrimination in
words-—-the yarn is told by Andy Watr
Iv.C. Once when the learned gentleman wa*
acting Judge he was caught in a collision, his
cab bumping into another so hard that both
he and the driver were thrown and injured
In the report the next day the Iv.C. read-
“ The driver of the cab was thrown to the
ground, while his Honor was precipitated to
the pavement.”
The Y.W.C.A. is at last appointing an
Australian woman as head of the organisa-
tion in our own land. It is really so intelli-
gent a body that it’s a wonder the idea didn’t
strike it long ago.
Who will lend a car or pay for one to help
carry the soldiers from Graythwaite out to
the A.J.C. meeting? These lame boys get
few outings, and a race meeting means great
joy to them for weeks before and after, id. (J.
Hordern is the sec. to the little committee
which looks after these matters.
The supper tables at the dance for the
Harnardo Home —it was held out at the
Coronation Hall, Bondi—call for three
cheers. The committee women, under the
presidency of Mrs. Edmund Playfair, had
brought out the best silver and crystal from
their Bellevue Hill homes, and, besides, had
spared their pockets not at all in the matter
of the food, which was all donated. The
big.: hall, which has one of the best dancing-
hoors in Sydney, only needed a splash of
Mandarin red added to its light-hearted violet
and daffodil balloons and streamers to make
the effect quite carnival. Mrs. Playfair
wore oyster-white satin, and was aided and
abetted by secretaries Mrs. Allen in iade
green taffeta and Miss Playfair in black.
The Blue Funnel people gave a luncheon-
Pciity on the Ulysses last week, and demon-

Leah Myers, who has been the cause of
enormous consumption of Oolong, Ceylon
and Orange Pekoe during the last two weeks,
is going off to fame and fortune by the
Maiwa. Beally the newly-made widow
Kiissell, she takes with her her two children,

operatic contract, is the Sydney singer’s ob-
jective. By the way, Leah, who left Sydney
a. mezzo-contralto, returned from her studies
abroad a dramatic soprano—the voice is rich
and golden and effortless.
A matchmaking dame who opened thp
season by- entertaining a party at her week-
end bungalow is claiming a record. Besides
a couple of married friends, she took with
her seven flappers and some young bache-
lors ; and seven engagements have been
announced. A sister and brother of one
family started the ball rolling by proclaim-
ing intended alliances with a brother and
sister of another; and a spare sister in each
of these families carried the matter further
by becoming engaged to two brothers, ire
engagements “catching,” or has tl* match-
making hostess discovered a love philtre?
Or is it just that same old seaside air?

F. J. Stevens (Mackay) : You wonder
“what the liquor interest, pays great publishing
mediums like The Bulletin for the part they are play-
ing in the tragedy"—referring to this paper’s cold-
ness towards prohibition. If The Bulletin: could bring
itself io believe that prohibition was a success it
would still be ashamed of the company it would
have to keep—the company of self-righteous Phari-
sees and narrow-minded and essentially dirty-minded
men who assume that, anybody who doesn’t think as
they do is a mental prostitute 5056: Your Digger
had been reading a Yankee snippet paper. It’s a
perennial over there. .. .C.J.T.: That Fiji friend is
talking rubbish. . .A. ILL.: Tito question into which you
gather the point of the sonnet seems to shake the
whole thing to pieces ; also, the form you use should
not, end in a couplet. .. .\Y.G. (Homebush) : Waste
of words.... Ewa: Not enough in the yarn; and
you don’t improve “laid" hv crossing it out and
writing “lied" when the word should be “lay’’....
A.L.D.: Doesn’t get near....P.R.D.: ltr- chief fault
is lack of meaning; but it is aFo rather short of
grammar, spelling, punctuation, rhythm, rhyme and
ink. .. .Annie 1,.: “My Tropic Hut” moves toe
heavily. .. . A.M.L.: No, it is not poetry, . . .Lauriston :
Wretched J.K. (Surry Hills): Doesn’t manage to
say it. ... Margaret S.: Not enough in “Knohaut-
ment.” ... .C.J.T.: Lacks interest. ... Peter S.: Mirf
go back.... Buka: Thanks; but interest in it is dead
now YH.L.: “Summer Idyll" is very thin....
N.A.E.: They must have more in them than a gently -
expressed commonplace. . . .Edna P.: No earthly good.
A.J.J.: Doesn’t strike us P.A.N.: The yarn
wobbles all over the place... .RAY.B. : “Toinmo"
doesn’t carry much intcre-t.... Arthur J.: You can’t
make a sonnet by merely sawing the lines off the
same length and putting in the required plugs of
rli.vnte K.T.H.: Might have a sporting chance.-...
S.S.M-.: Some good lines. ' Get to work on the bad
ones. .. .Ethel IV.: It is necessary to stand every final
syllable up on end to read it at a11....K.G. (Ivim-
bolton) : Not up. .. .C.L.C.: 'Doesn’t quite do it....
L.W.C.: Fair attempt. Don’t leave 0ff.... Veda;
No market here for that kind of thing. .. .A.H. 11.:
Too clumsy.. . .J.J.J.: The man who would rhyme
“books” with “socks” would rhyme carrots with
beetroot. .. .5.0.8. : “Light” is not bright enough.
... .Austin It.: Too rugged.. . .W.8.W.: No use...,
R. 5.8.: They don’t strike us, but the blank verse
fragment is the best.... Mary L.; Not well enough
done... .Onlooker: Not much use looking on unless
you see something... .11. L. (Kangaroo Point): You
don’t quite manage to bring the yarn to a fcfcus....
A.C.R.: Very lame little tiling. .. .Kathleen W.: Not
quite... .Joseph T.: Flutters too feebly... .W.J.S.:
The idyll of the car’s going deserves a run: —
We sit and spoon together,
We kiss and play away,
Like simple little children ;
Should the front ones look and say
“Oh, what’s this row behind here?”
We say we do not know;
They turn their heads, the course is clear
While the car is on the go.
... .Bowyanged Bloke: “Swing in the Centre”
misses, hut it isn’t bad in a rugged way.... Alb:
Too many Spring songs got in ahead of it. But
(with luck) there will be another September.... Ox:
No good. . . .D.1.W.: Verse thin. .. . W.F.C.: None
of them get near.... C.E.M.: Follows conventional
thought in poor verse. .. .8.P.8.J.: Old things said
in worse than the old way... .William V.: Not
much of a story and too wordy... .W.C.T.R.: You
continue to make it very uninteresting.... T.0.P.:
Statement that the seasons go in rotation noted....
A.J.S.: Not well enough done. .. . Coree’n: An imi-
tation of very bad models. .. .11 aka: Don’t like the
“Psychologist.”... .Carlton M.: “Mallee-Digg'er”
goes very unevenly. .. . J.W.M.: Dreary. . . .W.H.8.:
Spoiled in the telling... .P.O’R.: As slight as Car-
ruthers’s chances of borrowing three hundred mil-
lions.... Jay L.: Not enough meat in them....
Harry P.: Not for us. ...G.S. (South Yarra):
Monotonous... .Jas. B.: The sestet has one dragging

rible .... A. W.D.: Sonnet not well enough engineered.
....Edward B.: It all gets to nothing... .Yal S.:
Curious, but not suitable... ..T.C. (Northmead) : No
good. . . .A.J.M.G.: “Blind” fails,.. .Charles L.:
None of them quite do it. .. . W.J.D.: “After the
Storm” misses by a few inches.... Paula: The
“Witch,” “Success” and “Chanson” are all too
easy and too thin.... Rex: The “Ghosts” fail, but
not badly... ..Tean C.: Very poor stuff. .. .L.S.
(Charleville) : Goes too heavily... .S.J.S.: There’s
a hint of something in it. Keep on.... Manx Cat:
Not improved. .. .3.80: Put more work into it and
it; will make a yarn... .C.J.T.: You try to spread
the material for a par into a story... .L.E. (War-
randyte) : None oi them score. ... M.H. S’.: Very few
of those trick forms are worth while. . . ..J.A.W.: Not
attractive. .. .H.V.5.0.: What on earth do you mean
by a line like “While Death has taken men as they”?
. ...F.B. (Cheltenham): The aeroplane doesn't sing
in good enough verse.... G.E.M.: “The Messenger”
wants revision. .. .N.N.P.: Your professor is a
dreary person.... Nalillus: Not for us... .T.W.D.:
Nothing in it. .. .8.P.8.J.: Terrible verse... .L.L.
(Burwood): Good enough verse, but the matter isn’t
of much consequence... .Invictus: Worth trying
somewhere else... .Davey H.: No use offering us
serial novels. Every issue of The Bulletin is
complete in ’ itself... .Morton P.: Idea too print-
worn. .. .Alex.: Poorly done. .. .Gertrude M.: “Ding-
bats” won’t do. .. .C.L.M.: No use. .. .C.S.C.:
Rather p00r... . Saaedi: The miserable little tale
doesn’t get to anything more than a stab in the
dark... .F.T.H.: Boil it down to a par. .. .Spinifex:
Well done; but there’s too much unpleasantness on
the market at the moment. .. .E.H.G.: You can
hear it coming like a circus band.... Castor Royle:
Both 01d....G.F.: Your movie par looks like a jig-
saw puzzle.... Grey Lea: Note unintelligible, and
all pars below standard. .. .A.P.L.: You take a one-
eyed view of your subject; try to lift the other lid.

of paper belongs to the art or the literary depart-
ment. .. .Wasp: No sting in it... .Monaro: Snow has
never fallen at Cohar (N.S.W.) since it has been
Cobar.... J.J.: Such a recipe appeared in the Abo.
column some time ago.

Weaning time
for baby is
“Benger time ”
?>Bi
Weaning time need not
check development nor render
baby fretful. The transition
stage from the breast to
normal food is the stage when
Benger’s should be given to a
breast-fed baby.
fs
Food
is always prepared with fresh
new milk. It does more than
enrich the milk with valuable
food elements ; it adjusts the
milk itself to the delicate
digestion of a child. Baby
takes the change happily and
without check.
THE BOOK OF BENGER’S FOOD
is a medically approved guide to
the rearing of Infants and the
care of Invalids. Every household
should possess a copy. Write for
it to-day post free.

MISS IVY SHILLING
is the Original Rexona Girl.
y
Miss IVY SHILLING (from a photo).
The Rexona Girls now number
many thousands, and Miss Ivy
Shilling, who is everywhere recog-
nised as Australia’s greatest
dancer, is the original Rexona
Girl. Why not be a Rercona Girl
too? Use Rexona and Rexona
S'oap—it means health and’, beauty.
“I have much ol< ;asure
in recommending your
Rexona, for I have been
using it constantly for
some time.
“As a rub-down after
acrobatic dancing, and. as
a magical reviver to
strained muscles, I have
found it excellent. After
surfing it is invaluable as
a protection against sun-
burn and freckles. It is
a wonderful healer, and
I always keep a tin of it
handy.
“Yours sincerelyj
“(Sgd.) IVY SHILLING.”
All Australia Uses Rexona.
Never a day passes but that Rexona
scores another triumph over those serious
troubles of lit'c—Sores, Sunburn, Eczema,
Pimples, Blotches, Burns, Nasal Catarrh
and Rheumatism.
The dainty little triangular pot of
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, contains a com-
bination of the most curative, antiseptic,
soothing and healing properties known to
science.
Rexona is the Skin Remedy of the Age,
because it destroys the harmful germs that
may be present in a sore, pimple or any
abrasion of the skin, thus preventing any
contagion of the blood and at the same
time causes a new, healthy skin to grow.
Rexona immediately reduces the inflamma-
tion and pain; it acts as a distinct stimu-
lant to the pores of the skin, and sets up
a healing action immediately that increases
day by day.
To obtain skin perfection use Rexona
Soap daily, and Rexona, “The Rapid
Healer,” oil any skin affection. Get the
Rexona Habit, it means health and
beauty. Rexona, the Rapid Healer, 1/6
and 3/-. Rexona Soap, 1/- per tablet.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I PASSED by the Seven Towers of Maby-
lon
In the fragrant morn;
Grey of the battlements rising high
Into the blue of the April sky;
A flight of doves, like an arrow sped,
Merged in the white clouds overhead ;
Daffodils shone in the woods, dew-sweet,
Where the spring had lingered with flowery
feet;
And I prayed that never a wind of woe
Might round the towers of Mabylon blow —
The Seven Towers.
I passed by the Seven Towers of Mabylon
In the showery noon,
Fires of the foe on every hill,
A w r ind in the valleys, swift and chill;
By the eastern gate with the ivy wild
I looked in the eyes of a frightened child ;
On the sodden path through the poplar grove
I saw the blood-stained wing of a dove ;
And low in the rain of the ghastly day
The topmost stones of the great tower's lay—-
The Seven Towers.
I passed by the ruined towers of Mabylon
In the silent night;
The moon with her gracious lamp had shed
A silvern peace on the place of dread.
High in a niche of the crumbling wall
I heard the sound of a dove’s soft call,
And I said, “Ay, sunshine after the rain!
God grant we may live to build again
The towers that guarded our childhood’s
days,
Ere we knew the woe of the great world’s
ways—
The Seven Towers.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CORNELIUS DRAFFIN and Peter
O’Shaughnessy came at last to the
edge of the range on a warm summer
afternoon in January, and were immediately
cheered and immeasurably refreshed by the
grateful and comforting sight of the green
lowlands with the immense blue sea splash 7
ing a long line of delicate lace-like foam
clown the far-stretching coast two thousand
feet below them.
“ ’Tis as green as Erin, glory be to God !”
remarked Corny, as he sat down on the
brink of the precipice.
"An’ as fresh as th’ marnin’ jew!” said
Peter baring his head to the coolness of the
nor’-easter.
They had tramped wearily, drily and
warmly from Sydney, through Liverpool,
Campbell Town and Appin, during three
blazing summer days. The end of the first
one found them in the little village on
George’s River, with still 13 miles of their
appointed stage to make, and they had
walked on after sundown into what had
•seemed to the young Irish immigrants the
borderland of Hell.
In 1825 the districts to the south of the
Parramatta River were still altogether heav-
ily timbered —there are considerable belts of
forest about the old Cow Pastures yet —and
to-night the bush on either side of the narrow
lane of the Great Southern-road had been
swept by tire, and presented a varied pano-
aof smoky darkness and incandescent
to an accompaniment of crackling
flames, the crash of red-hot trees and the
pungent smell of burning eucalyptus. Over-
head the sky was gloomy and still, and the
night was swelteringly hot. The haze and
heat wrapped itself about their sweating-
bodies, and their eyes smarted with the acrid
smoke.
It was a night of wonders to the two
young newchums. In one place they saw an
old-man ’possum come hurriedly out of a
lofty hollow “spout,” chased by the flames,
and dodge frantically about the end of the
dry bough before he elected to hurl himself
out into space —it was 40 feet to the ground.
He moved hurriedly to and fro to avoid the
shooting tongues of flame, and they stood
watching him with soft-hearted sympathy
until the poor brute, unable longer to endure
the cruel torture, made the prodigious leap.
To their amazement he jumped to his feet
again, after lying for a bare moment motion-
less, rolled over two or three times and then
raced into the bush.
“Did iver ye see the like, now?” gasped
Peter.
“ ’Tis a flyin’ leprechaun !” marvelled Cor-
nelius.
And then they had the ill-luck to meet a
wicked man in the burning forest who was
the cause of all their trouble.
Captain John Tremayne was one of the
cantankerous sort of Cornishmen, in whom
the rough good nature of his race was miks-
ing. He was the Commissioner who ruled
over the Southern districts of New South
Wales from. Goulburn Plains to the Mur-
rumbidgee— at that time spaciously referred
to as “the New Country.” Cranky Jack they
had called him in the army, and the name
fitted him better than his uniform. A petty
man with powers that only a great one could
worthily exercise, there was no official be-
tween Cape Howe and Moreton Bay who
had ever contrived to get himself so whole-
somely disliked by all who had to do with
him, whether as subordinates, equals or
superiors. He was riding back towards
Goulburn with what would have been, in
any other, man, a broken heart beneath his
jacket. Pretty Fanny Lacy, the daughter
of old lom Lacy, of Rachel’s Ponds, near
Bringelly, had very scathingly said “No”
to his recent proposal of marriage, made only
that afternoon.
.* A n A why, pray, Miss Fanny, are you un-
m illing to give me hope?” he had foolishly
asked her.
e ~ hhwause, she had responded with delight?;
full\ trank spitefulness, “they call you
W hen the two young immigrants came
upon him in the blazing forest it was very
; evident that be had imparted some of his
crankiness to his mare. Silhouetted darkly
against the glow of the fires, they saw a frantic
m-elpruHv 1 fon ai V n a beav £t. top-hat—which

hackney pnouettmg in circles about the road,.
the Commissioner hanging on to the bridle
with both hands and the mare tugging him,
as he screamed with rage, in any direction
but the one in which he desired to go.
“Faith, ’tis nothin’ but wonders we do be
seein’ this night!” Corncy stopped to gape
at thq queer performance in the illuminated
haze that hung over the forest. “Is it mor-
thal man he is, now, Peter?”
O’Shaughnessy ran up behind the mare, and
hit her upon the rump with his open hand
as she pawed the air above the frantic little
booted gentleman, who had just time to leap
out of the way as her forefeet descended on
the gravel. Peter shooed her up from the
rear, and she consented to walk nervously
after her rider a few steps along the road.
“Will I not liould her head, y’r honor?”
he cried, seizing the bridle.
To his immense bewilderment he found
himself looking down the barrel of a pistol.
“D—n you !” snarled Captain Tremayne
—“you nearly had her a-top of me. Put
your hands above your head, you rascal. T
arrest you on suspicion of bushranging. Just
show me your pass, you scoundrel. I warn
you I’m a magistrate. You had best not
trifle with me, sir!”
“ ’Tis a quare counthry,” muttered Cor-
nelius as he ran up behind the bareheaded
little man who was threatening his aston-
ished mate —“what wid flyin’ -squir’ls and
little people!”
The pistol exploded harmlessly as Mr.
Commissioner Tremayne found himself
seated on his buttocks in the road, to his
great anger and humiliation, with a big young
man, huge-fisted and powerful, gripping him
so firmly by the nape of the neck that he
could not move.
“You villains!” he spluttered. The tight
grip did not relax.
“Villuns, is it!” growled Corney. “What
kind of gratitude have ye, at all, at all—
ye ugly little divil ye? Wid yer murdherin’
pistol, an’ y’r bad talk ! Let the hor-rse go,
Pether lad. We’ll have th’ nasty little ban-
shee go catch her himself f’r his high-mighti-
ness. Bushrangers, indade!”
Peter released the mare, which immediately
galloped off into the smoky darkness. Cor-
nelius seized the pistol and wrested it from
his prisoner, leaning over to snatch it from
his hand. He sent it flying after the disap-
pearing steed, jerked the Commissioner to
his feet and kicked him so smartly behind
that he stumbled forward on to his hands
and knees, and then on to his face. He
scrambled to his feet breathlessly with his
nose bleeding and inarticulate with splutter-
ing fury.
“Ye’ll suffer for this—this outrage!” he-
gasped.
Mr. Drafiin laughed at him.
“Good night to ye, thin, me little gintle-
rrian. ’Tis a pretty figure o’ fun ye look, so
it is! Come along, Pether, me bhoy, we’ll
lave him walk off his angry passions. He’ll
not catch th’ mare this side o’ sunrise. Good-
night to ye, sorr, an’ may Given send ye a
betther hear-rt!” He made a mocking bow
and walked away with the grinning Peter.
It was dark when they descended into the
green levels of the Five Islands country, as
the Illawarra used to be known in the old
days—from Coal Cliff to Iviama —and it
looked to the two unsophisticated travellers
that the night would be supperless and roof-
less.
With a simple faith in their luck they had
strolled away into the bush a week after
landing from the Ballyshannon to seek their
fortunes, carrying neither blanket nor billy,
food, nor firearms, and with a very little
hoard of coin of the'realm in “holey-dollars”
and “dumps” that was guarded and trans-
ported by Cornelius. Someone had told them
that there was work to be had at the Five
Islands amongst the cedar-getters and how
to get there via the overland route by Camp-
bell Town and Appin and across the range.
So they had come thus far with extra-
ordinary luck, since it was the common ex-
perience of all travellers of the poorer sort
to be suspected of having run away from
assigned service as convicts, and not infre-
quently-to be dragged back in handcuffs along
the way they had come, or in whatever direc-
tion a bench of magistrates was to be found.
For many years the infamous Bushranging
Act—though it was hardly in force in ’2s—
to legalise false imprisonment, and
to • sanction the whim of any constable or
magistrate who might not like the look of
any wayfarer. Before it was sanctioned sus-
picious interference with the liberty of the
subject was practised, all the same, and the
onus of proving his right to walk about as
he pleased was on the suspect. It was quite
a record on the part of Peter and Cornelius
to have come all the way from Sydney to the
Five Islands without having been molested.
The measured cadence of the sea falling
on a beach beyond the tall forest in which
they found themselves when they came down
on to The narrow flat between Bulli Moun-
tain and the ocean at the beginning of the
night was the only sound that broke the still-
ness of the summer evening. That is to say,
the only other sound: for the chirping of
crickets, the sweet notes of willy-wagtails
and all the hundred noises of the bush at
night-time chorused strangely in their unac-
customed ears. Over the treetops a pale
radiance was stealing up. the sky, which
Peter was confident must portend the rising
of the moon—even though nothing happened
in this “quare” country as it was wont to
happen elsewhere.
“Sure v it might aisy be the sun a-comin’
back. Ye niver can tell what’s a-goin’ to
happen in a counthry where ’tis midsummer
at Chris’mas, an’ I’m tould they have frosts
in June,” he remarked as an afterthought to
his prediction. “We’ll just sit down an’ wait
for th' light, whativer soort it may be.”
The solemn quiet of the mighty forest
stretching about them impressed the two
Irish lads with a feeling of awe. Overhead
the high roof of leaves only permitted stray
stars to peep down upon them in a winking
fashion as the feathery tops .swayed gently
in little straying breezes, and the dim colum-
nar aspect of the white trunks of the great
trees that towered on every hand, receding
in dim arcades and avenues into the heart
of the night, was ghostly and mysterious.
To keep his spirits from sinking Cornelius
began to whistle. As, the first, notes of the
dirge-like tune he selected, appropriately to
this solemn place, shrilled out'into the still'
-atmosphere of the wooded depths, a dog

barked loudly, close at hand. They rose to
their feet hopefully.
"Sure, we mightn’t have to slape in th’
night air, afther all,” said Petei*. "Wan o’
these quare rings o’ silver they- call money’ll
surely buy us bite an’ sup, an’ mebbe a
place beside th’ fire for to lie down.” They
went a littje way along the track in the
direction of the yapping, and presently the
glare of a fire from an open doorway lit the
bushes opposite. A big man came and stood
in the opening, and called to the dog to quiet
him. The travellers walked up, and bade
him good evening.
"Good night to ye, then, and who may ye
be? I thought ’twas me own mates back
Rom the saw-pit. Step inside and sit ye
down. A drop o’ tea? Mebbe ye’d like a
bite to eat?”
This friendly welcome cheered them im-
mensely, and presently they were seated
at a rough slab table, regaling themselves
upon kangaroo and damper, washed down
with strong “post-and-rail.”
“So ye’ve come to the Five Islands a-
lookin’ for work, have ye ?” Their stout
host, a red-faced, cheery individual with a
wooden leg, which, he explained, he had
worn since Waterloo, regarded them with
interest. "And what may ye have been sent
out for?”
“Sent out, thin?” asked Corney, a little
puzzled.
“What was ye lagged for? How long
have ye to wait for y’r tickets?”
“Tickets—how ?” inquired Peter.
The big man laughed. “Well, then, I see
y’r a pair o’ jimmygrants, ain’t that so?
’Tis a pity, for ye’re two likely-look‘-
ing young chaps. But if ye’ve never
been lagged, ye’ll hardly do for these parts.
Me mates was wantin’ a couple o’ lads' that
might be handy wi’ the axe, an’ th’ pay’s
none so bad, though th’ work is hard and
reg’lar. Jackass to jackass—that’s th’ rule
in th’ Five Islands cedar-brush. But none
of us cares much .about work-in’ wi’ free
objects. Tain’t nat’ral. Bond an’ free don’t
mix. Hullo ! Here they come. Ye can put.
it to them, if ye like—but big Dan’s not much
of a cove . for fav’rin’ jimmygrants.. Why
couldn’t ye ha’ come reg’lar, like th’ rest of
us?”
There was a confused noise of talking out-
side, and their host put his head out the
door. Instantly he drew back, and they
noticed that he looked scared. “Troopers!”
he whispered hoarsely. “Four o’ th’ cows.”
He had hardly spoken when a man in uni-
form appeared in the doorway and stared at
the occupants of the hut. He wore the
jacket of the mounted-police, and a heavy
sabre clanked at his side. The chevrons of
a sergeant were on his sleeve. After a quick
glance at the two young Irishmen seated at
the table, he called back over his shoulder:
“Come in here, a couple o’ ye. Here they
are. I got ’em in here.”
Peter O’Shaughnessy rose to his feet, and
took a step tow-ards the door. Immediately
the sergeant whipped a pistol from behind
his back and shot him dead.
“Now then, you,” he yelled to the bewild-
ered Corny Draffin, “put your hands out on
the table —quick, now! I arrest ye for
stickin’ up Cap’n Tremayne, the Commis-
sioner, on th’ Goulburn-road.”
“Mother o’ God:” whispered the amazed
Cornelius as the handcuffs clicked on his
wrists. ” ’Tis a quare counthry !”
* * * *
Captain John Tremayne, Commandant of
the penal establishment at Norfolk Island
ui 1888, was a very religious man. He had
all the Cornish fervor for his particular
creed, so characteristic of his countrymen
wherever they wander in or about the earth.
It was a grievance to him that the only
chaplains on the island were those of the
Church of England and the Roman Catholic
faith, and that, officially, he had to attend
the service of the former, and was compelled
to countenance what he regarded as the ter-
rible idolatries of the latter. The chaplain,
the Rev. Paul Tayne, was a dipsomaniac,
and the Commandant regarded Father Roger
Delany, who did the work of both of them,
excepting ritualistic observances and ser-
vices, as a wickedly worldy person who was
almost a danger to his Government.
Had he only known it he owed his life
twice over to the R.C. chaplain. More than
once his murder had been plotted at select
meetings in the prison wards at night-time.
Twice pure accident had saved him—once
when a musket snatched from a sentry had
missed fire in the eager hands of the man
who had drawn the lucky lot, and once when
he slipped and sprained his ankle on his own
doorstep, as he was about to attend the exe-
cution that had been thoughtfully arranged
for him at the morning muster in the gaol.
Father Roger’s good services had been purely
confidential affairs between the chaplain and
certain members of his flock. On one of
these occasions the worthy priest had bought
the Commandant’s reprieve with a demijohn
of rum, which was a great sacrifice to make
for such a heretic as Cranky Jack.
He was a great flogger. The scourger,
Billy Polglaise, was the only other adherent
of his faith in the .settlement, and possibly
the only friend he possessed in the island.
He was still a bachelor at the age of 48, and
Billy was his body-servant and valet, and
the congregation to which he was wont to ex-
pound the more damnatory portions of Holy
Writ —with which his savage faith princi-
pally concerned itself —on Sunday afternoons
in the dining-room at Governhient House,
down by Emily Bay.
Billy was a man of parts. You can hardly
be a flogger, a valet, a gardener, a butler and
an elder without being a person of diverse
capacities. Officers of the civil establish-
ment and the garrison did not enjoy having
their wine poured out for them by the flagel-
lator at the Commandant’s stiff little
monthly dinners, but they knew better than
to say so. Captain Tremayne was not a
nice person when it came to avenging either
a snub or an impertinence. The way he
had hounded young Eric Jones out of the
army itself —after that rash subaltern had
had the temerity to stand up for one of his
corporals whom the great man had unjustly-
accused, on the doubtful evidence of Billy
Polglaise, of robbing his flower-garden—had
shown that. It was just as well, if you
wanted a quiet life, to accept anything that
Cranky Jack did.
Once a fortnight it was the Commandant’s
custom to have himself rowed to Phillip
Island, the picturesque pyramid of red earth
and rock that rises out of the blue ocean
five miles to the south of the tiny mainland.
In those days the rabbits had not been intro-
duced to it, and it was still as green as
Norfolk Island is to-day. A boat ferried
him across soon after daylight and came
back for him at dusk, leaving him alone all
day in pious contemplation of his savage
God and relaxation from the cares of office.
Once a fortnight Norfolk Island breathed
freely.
It had been reported to him at daylight,
when he came to the boatshed at Sydney Bay,
that a prisoner had committed suicide off the
rocks below Point Ross, leaving his hat
and a scrawl of charcoal to testify to his de-
parture for an easier world than Norfolk
Island. Cornelius Draffin was the man’s
name, and he was serving a life sentence for
bushranging, after having escaped from Port
Macquarie in 1828. The Commandant knew
him well—had known him from the very
commencement of his career of lawlessness—
and had seen to it that his stay on Norfolk
Island had been no holiday.
“Make the brute feel it, Billy,” he would
say to his butler, whenever that useful domes-
tic was called upon to reason with Corny
Draffin.
“Aye, y’r honor,” would respond the faith-
ful soul. “He’ll not forget his rudeness to
y’r honor in th’ Goulburn-road!”
When the boat was a speck in the heaving
blue strait the Commandant removed his
hat and knelt in prayer. He always began
his day’s retreat with pious observance of
this kind.
“O Board,” he concluded this morning. “I
dew thank Thee for taking the man Draffin's
punishment into Thine own hands. I be-
seech Thee that Thou wilt make his punish-
ment befitting tew his wickednesses. I pray
and beseech Thee humbly”
“Git up out o’ that, ye devil,” a hoarse
voice said, as a hard and powerful hand
gripped him about the back of the neck, in
exactly the way he had been gripped eight-
years before in the Goulburn-road. “ ’Tis my
turu-m now!”
He felt another hand insert itself in the
pocket of his shooting-coat, and saw his
pistol describe an arc, as it spun out into the
creaming waters about the rocky shore.
Then he was released, and turned fearfully
to see the scowling face of a man who had
been changed into a wild- beast at Port Mac-
quarie and Norfolk Island —but more par-
ticularly at Norfolk Island. Cornelius Draf-
fin was barely 30 in ’33, but the weight of
his years was heavy upon him, and the
cedar-getters’ hutkeeper at the Five Islands
would not have recognised in the brutal-
looking prisoner who glowered at his perse-
cutor on Phillip Island the fresh and happy-
faced young immigrant he had offered hospi-
tality to that summer night in Illawarra in
’25. But John Tremayne knew him well
enough.
“How—-how did you come here?” he
gasped, a little fearfully.
“Swum.”
"Wh—what are you going to do with me?”
"Torture yo to death, ye hell-hound.”
"Will you let me pray, Draffin?”
"No!”
Whether his screams disturbed the sea-
birds much cannot be said. But it is likely
that they did, for his eyes were gouged out,
and he had sulfered nameless mutilation when
they found his body in the evening. He was
quite alone at the edge of Phillip Island,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
days of happy, carefree friendship
between the two had passed. The
time when she could have been named
among the unbroken pearls of his life was
now but a saddening memory rising before
his tortured imagination like some frightful
demon striving to magnify the horrors of
the present.
Day by day he had shrunk from her
more and more. Her mere presence irri-
tated him, pained him, and at times threat-
ened to drive him to desperate things.
Go where he would she would plague him.
Her nerve-tearing presence would creep upon
him in the midst of his work or rouse Mm
from his well-earned slumber. She seemed
to possess no qualms of conscience, no care
or consideration, but when she pleased and
as she pleased she exercised her terrible be-
witchment.
But now her day for him had passed. Never
again could she take a place of use or
affection in his existence. And still he could
not bear to have himself torn forever from
her. There was an irrepressible pang in the
thought of that parting. A sense of loneli-
ness seemed' to dwell in the inevitable empty
space, never again to be filled by the one-
time partner of his very life.
The last moment of hesitation had arrived.
He would do it. He must cast aside all
reluctance, all sentiment. Her effect on him
was too maddening to be longer borne.
He arose from his seat and moved rapidly
from the room. . A look of determination
covered his features as he, machine like,
without a thought, put on his hat and over-
coat.
Down the street he hurried, hat jambed
down on ears, hands huddled in the pockets
of his greatcoat. He scarcely noticed
whither he went or what or whom he passed.
Some sense external to him seemed to be
guiding him.
At last he reached his destination. He
waited, watched, and at last moved for the
final plunge.
“Now, which one is it?” asked the white-
coated man peering down his throat.
“That rotten back one,” he gasped, “and
hurry up.”
The dentist got to work.

It 13 the severe demands that are satisfied by SHIRLEY PRES-
IDENT BRACES without sacrificing any of the strength that
makes for long wear
The extra heavy SHIRLEY PRESIDENT BRACES are rein-
forced in every part without sacrificing that proverbial comfort
that wearers of SHIRLEY PRESIDENTS are so proud to speak of
In SHIRLEY PRESIDENT BRACES nearly all of the strain is
taken up by the sliding cable cords and swivels. The life of
Shirley Presidents is therefore far longer
