SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1888.
The Dying Fetiches.
The old, decaying “shores” of Monarchy are
stooping to their fall. Every day the great
machine which for ages and ages has ground
out human misery with every revolution of
its jarring wheels shows new signs of the
deerepfcitude which accompanies unhonoured
age, and every day the cataclysm comes
nearer. All Europe and two-thirds of Asia
are filled with the whispers of a stupendous
upheaval which is to break out —somewhere,
and in which armed millions are to tear each
other to pieces for some undefined purpose
which never takes visible form ; and every-
where a shapeless terror hangs over the Old
World and portends the approaching break-
down of the hoary tyrannies which link the
nineteenth century to the era cf the Goths
and Huns. Long years of ceaseless retro-
gression have brought Europe back to the
point from which she started 20 centuries
ago ; arts, science, Christianity, civilisation,
have added a polish to the barbarism of
older days, but the system of Government
has undergone no material change ; now, as
in the distant past, every man Is a soldier,
and all Europe is a camp, and public policy
is summed up in the sentence, “ Let us kill
somebody,” and the world is growing weary
of this dismal era of bloodshed and intrigue.
The tired old figureheads of monarchy, which
never, since monaichy was first invented,
served any one useful purpose in the scheme
of creation, still refuse to recognise that a
new era is dawning on mankind, and that
the time is approaching when the many will
refuse to be butchered for the amusement
of the few ; but princes are more obtuse than
common men axul the deluge always comes
upon them unawares.
« * *
A few months ago a great potentate was
prematurely removed from this mundane
sphere when well on towards his hundredth
birthday. For many years the eyes of
Europe had been fixed upon him as he sat on
his throne gorged into insensibility w ith
buttered crab, and filled almost to the top
of his head with a soup of barbarous con-
struction, in which red herrings, sour wine
and ancient cabbage soaked in vinegar were
prominent features. Apart from his crown
this commonplace old cast-iron drlllraaster
was nobody in particular. He was always
hungry and always anxious for something to
eat. Practically he swayed the destinies’of
the world, but the destinies of the world
troubled him little in his later years ; the
fate of nations was in his hands but a cease -
less stomach-ache harassed him, and so the
overfed old man drifted on as a living
example of the meanness and littleness
of kings. Teen he died, and half the
world was stricken with panic, because a
race of fools had entrusted to this gluttonous
patriarch the power of drenching the earth
with blood, and spreading ruin and desola-
tion and death and bankruptcy over all the
lands between the German Ocean and Kam-
tschatka, and the clay god having eaten
himself to death, all was a blank. And now
the eyes cf Europe are turned on a young
prince with a distorted frame and masses of
cotton wool in his ears, on whose head the
crown of the Hohenzollerns has devolved,
and whose single intellect must decide
whether the results of centuries of materia
progress are or are not to be undone.
♦ • •
Further East a drunken and ignorant Czar
sits uneasily on a seething mass of disaffec-
tion and prays the only prayer which now
passes the lips of a Romanoff —that things
may last his time. His father offered up tie
same petition before him and offered it up as
he does on the points of four million bayonets.
In his case the petition was answered. He
went forth one day to show himself to his
loving subjects, and an hour later an almost
unrecognisable mass of crowned cats-
meat was brought back in a carriage,
and the world knew that Alexander
had been taken from the wrath to come.
His predecessor, Nicholas, died a natural
death—of rage and liquor and, it is more
than whispered, of poison, and so he also
escaped the deluge ; but few of the Czars
come to so peaceful an ending. These
memories of the past are fast driving Alex-
ander 111. into insanity. He has already
become a dreary hypochondriac who sees
visions and dreams of phantoms, and starts
from shapeless terrors ; and, in his distrac-
tion, he masses great armies and conducts
incoherent manoeuvres and dictates in-
ebriated protocols, and is steadily drinking
and drivelling Europe into a war, of which
no one can see the end And meanwhile,
throughout his empire, the clank of fetters
is in the air, and the cries of thousands of
tortured prisoners, as they eat their lives out
in noisome dungeons, go up to heaven, and
all Russia exists In a living death that one
worthless Romanoff may not die.
* w
In Austria a dull and commonplace man
of no account sits on the throne, and, with
stupid, cumbrous motion, prepares for the
war which everyone feels to be inevitable,
though where or why or by whom it is to be
waged none can tell with any certainty. He
belongs to the oldest reigning house in
Europe, a family which is slowly decaying
under the pressure of insanity, epilepsy, and
other hereditary maladies, but the Hafs-
burgs cling with a tenacious grip to the
Roman crown, and a stupendous levy of
armed men has been ordered to prop
up their bedridden dynasty. To the
south of his territories a mystic and melan-
choly Oriental, whose father and brother
were both lunatics, and who is alternately
the deepest schemer and the most harmless
driveller of the East, lurks in his seraglio
and orders the rifles of his guards to be kept
unloaded lest they should go off by their own
accord and scatter his corrupted brains
against the wall; while to the North another
crowned madman, brother and successor to
a madman, howls in a padded room in the
Bavarian capital and gibbers through the
windows upon the subjects over whom he
rules by virtue of the divine right of kings.
The rest of the German states which sur-
vived the disastrous days of 1866 are
governed by a multiplicity of petty princes—
shadowy potentates with morganatic wives
and families of dubious origin ; hungry,
drunken monarchs who sway their hereditary
sceptres in ramshackle chateaux and whose
sons polish their own boots in Prussian
barracks while awaiting the advent of the
day when they will succeed to the inverted
kerosene-tin of their fathers and guide the
destinies of a little territory a day’s donkey-
ride in diameter. History, so far, tells of
no German prince who ever took in washing,
but the royal beadles of the Fatherland
have experimented on every other form of
degradation, and persistent intermarriage
has spread an ineradicable taint of insanity
through the ancestral humpies in which they
wield the green-cotton umbrella of sove-
reignty.
• » *
Danmark, which exerts in Central Europe
an influence altogether disproportioned to
its size and resources, is slowly dying under
the rule of a foolish and stone-deaf tyrant,
who has long posed before the world as a
philanthropist of the first magnitude ;
and his stone-deaf family promises favourably
to keep up the traditions of the dynasty.
The taint of scrofula and mental disease
which a constant series of royal alliances has
spread throughout nearly every reigning
house in continental Europe is now making
itself felt in the at Copenhagen, and
is also fast corrupting the sturdy physique
of the descendants of Bernadotte in Sweden ;
and the ceaseless flow of the impure blood of
the minor German princes into England has
given to that country a series of wooden-
headed and sordid rulers of whom the
Anglo-Saxon race has little cause to be
proud. For many years the Guelbhs with-
stood the contagion. Dull, stagnant, illi-
terate, mean, immoral, parsimonious, and
unsentimental as so many wooden gods, this
cart-horse race of thirsty beer-drinkers held
out well against the destroying diseases
which, in Europe, have become the preroga-
tive of kings ; but of later years epilepsy,
the sure forerunner of insanity, Las ap-
peared among them, and the great
States of the Old World can now boast
without fear of contradiction that very
few of their anointed rulers are thoroughly
responsible beings, while more than one is
incompetent even to come in when it rains.
Of kingly rulers there are none left, unless
Humbert of Italy may be so described ; the
only other sovereign of recent times who
even aspired to the designation was the
gilded Caesar who went down at Sedan, and
left behind him a legacy of woe which France
will never forget.
• • «
Such as they are, the monarchy of Europe
are now filling that continent with rumours
of coming bloodshed and new disaster.
Lunatics, epileptics and drunkards are mass
ing gigantic armies to guard thrones and
crowns which are of use to no one but the
owner ; diseased and tottering potentates are
feebly shoring up each other with treaties
and parchments ; almost every able-bodied
man in a whole continent is posing in uni-
form ; and yet no one knows even now why
the great struggle which everyone foresees
should be undertaken. A huge phantom of
coming desolation looms through the mist
of intrigue and royal aberration but there
is still no visible casus belli, and no
national issue is at stake. Meanwhile,
underneath the thrones of the dull, ignorant
tyrants, the ground is being hollowed out
by the undermining influence of disaffection
and incipient revolt, and the time is steadily
approaching when crowns and sceptres will
topple together into the abyss. Out of the
chaos which is dawning a new world will be
built. Monarchy has proved itself too ex-
pensive an institution to be much longer
endured. The barren waste of history—the
arid, lifeless, interminable desert of sand on
which is written the record of the past—tells
of nothing but bloodshed and horror ; every
hill in Europe and Asia looks down on a
battle-field where human misery was piled
up to avenge the petty differences of kings,
and the kings of the present day are the
same as those of long ago. And war has
now become a terribly expensive experiment.
Six months of strife costs hundreds of thou-
sands of human lives, and amasses debts
which three centuries of industry cannot re-
pay. The last hundred years of waifare has
mortgaged Europe for 3000 years to come,
and yet in the whole ghastly catalogue of
murder and wrong there is not written the
story of one campaign which was undertaken
for any other purpose than the gratification
of one man’s lust and malice. And, great
as have been the horrors of war, it is ques-
tionable if the horrors cf pease have not been
greater still. Morally and intellectually the
monarchs of the present day are the very
dregs of humanity, and, if history is not a
gigantic fiction, they have mostly been little
else since Monarchy began.
® *
It is for the purpose of taking a hand in
this great game of insanity and demoniac
folly that the shirt-sleeved Caesars of Aus-
tralia are invited to come forward and be a
pale and ignominious refit x of the other
OiESAE—the bounceable crusader who did
not dare tr die at Sedan. Compared with
the politicians of modern Europe the hyaana
follows the higher walks of diplomacy, and
the policy of the kites and crows is a refine-
ment of the science of government when
contrasted with the ruffianly violence and
dull hypocrisy which pass for statecraft in
an era which is called Christian be cruse its
empty oaths are sworn in the name of a dis-
honouredGoD. Yet “Loyalty,” as now under-
stood in Australia, means that this country is
called upon to cast in her lot with the dying
world and share the destinies of Europe at a
time when Europe is on the brink of a
fathomless abyss. We are cheerfully sum-
moned to touch pitch and not be defiled ; to
challenge an Imperial lunatic let loose ; to go
16,000 miles out of our path to place our-
selves between two millstones which grind
exceeding small. There is so much to lose
and so little to gain that the programme is
not an attractive one. The man who seeks
the lion of the desert for the express pur-
pose of treading on its tail is not generally
regarded as an individual of genius, but his
action is an inspiration from heaven com-
pared to the programme of the Imperial
Federation grovellers who are now loose in
this Continent.
The Revolt Has Begun:
Were it not so, what need of the late New South
Wales military preparations on behalf of Capital?
What need of Nordenfeldts and armies if it were
not recognised that this strike differed from the
rest in proclaiming war, not against individuals,
but against a System ? The revolt has begun .
what though want and the fear of military assaults
compel the strikers to resume slavery upon a com-
promise, or even less ? In that very display of
force is the recognition of this fact : that those
who produce are entitled tc the material and the
fruits of their production—entitled to the full
exchange value of the latter, and entitled to keep
away all who would deprive them of their places
at the raw material when they wish still to utilize
their own labour at those places. What though
for awhile suffering and soreness of heart be sub-
stituted for active protest ? It is only that fresh
fuel is being added to the fire which smoulders
beneath the surface, and which will break out
above so much the more surely for all that
is fed into it, for such fuel can never
stifle the flame of its own burning until
it stifles the flame of life itself, leaves the
millionaire slaveless, and bids him labour or die.
A small jet of flame subsides, but a huge ember is
glowing, from which shall burst presently—if the
cause be not taken away—one vast searing sheet of
fire. It is non alone the miners who have suffered
—it is the People. Capital has made its thousands
by retailing that for which it paid nothing, and
waste, at famine prices, of the best. And the
People have come to see that they too are the
chattels of every slave-owner ; that there is profit-
slavery as well as wage-slavery. The People are
beginning to say : “My children are the members
of my own body; their freedom is mine; who
wounds one of them, wounds me.” And the
People will shortly also say : “ Get you gone, you
who have taken a monopoly of my earth. The
world is mine, and I am going to use it with these
workers, the members of my body. He who
denies the freedom to these my limbs, bids Man-
kind cease from the Earth.” Presently the People
will add : “ He who bids Mankind to cease, is not
in truth human. He shall cease himself.” Then
will be the Revolution !
* •
Will it be a revolution of blood ? Let the
usurpers answer for themselves. If they feel the
force of what is coming, and gradually abandon
their monopolies ; if, under the gradually-increas-
ing pressure of public thought, they leave usury
and teach their sons to produce material or mental
wealth, instead of wringing their needs from
others, and urge those sons to stand foremost in
the ranks of the revolters, that they may not be
ground down by other usurpers as the masses had
been : the revolution will be under the red flag of
fraternity, and its blood will run in torrents
through hearts of joy.
• • *
But if they short-sightedly cling to the trade of
plunder, and their sons learn to regard it as their
right—if they rely on anti-labourer laws and Nor-
denfeldt guns to crush the masses into subjection
—they will see the red flag waving over bayonet
and rifle, point to point, muzzle to muzzle, charge
to charge ; they will see blood without flesh, and
flesh without blood. They will see- and they will
see no more. The Revolution will pass over
them, and it can never be stayed. The People are
invincible.
• « •
The revolt has begun ! In France, as here, the
military have been employed to prevent the
strikers from meeting those not yet on strike, with
the result that a good many of the latter have
thrown down their tools and left work, and
already blood has been shed. In America, as
here, spurious “ dynamite-plots ” have been laid
to throw consternation into the ranks of Labour,
and estrange sympathy from those who are bat-
tling against greed and fraud, and already lives
have been sacrificed. In Germany, in England,
in Italy, in Roumania the same things are going
on, and blood streams on every side, shed not by
the Revolution, but against it. Perhaps it will
not be long before it pours out in Australia to in-
timidate those who are claiming their rights.
Within three years the periodical cycle of misery
is due in Melbourne, and its effects will be felt in
the course of a short time all over the continent.
Then we shall see what we shall see !
O *
But, sharp and bitter as it may be that the
struggle shall grow, it is not for ever that humanity
is going to suffer at the hands of its taskmasters
and plunderers. The signs that are looming over
all the earth are signs that have not been seen since
legend was repeated or history written. The con-
ditions of life have altered so that all things
are seen face to face. The race has grown so close
as to form only one being—Man—and there is no
room for another to be master. Already the
Voice of the People is heard murmuring dimly in
all the quarters of the globe. Already the indi-
viduality of malcontent and proprietor is felt to be
merged in the solidarity of Human Right against
Privileged Appropriation, Already the weapons
of the Nations are being withdrawn from the reach
of the people and filched to guard the interests of
the Privileged Classes. Already the great mer-
chants and speculators of the earth are whispering
for a federation of strong Governments that they
may be able to concentrate their forces the more
effectively and prevent the preachers of liberty
from having a refuge or a place to stand. And
already the workers are steadily, silently making
their preparations by literature, organisation, and
tacit comprehension, to nullify all these schemes
of oppression and possess themselves, once and for
peaceably, if it be possible, but by any means
and at any cost—of the full heritage of men. The
Revolt has begun!
The Boom of 1975.
Among the latest wonders of science is that
diabolical application of the electric light by
means of which a medical sharp, after insinuating
a smooth and slippery tube into your throat, pre-
sently illuminates your viscera as a candle-end
lights up a Chinese lantern, and forthwith pro-
ceeds to demonstrate what is wrong with your
conscience, or liver, much the same thing, and
how many whiskeys-straight it has taken to bring
your stomach into the condition he discloses.
That which the doctor does for the body cor-
poreal the statistician does for the body politic,
and New South Wales’ Mr. Coghlan may cer-
tainly claim that, so far as his colony is concerned,
his Statistical Kegister, just published, lets the
light in on its dark places with vigour and suc-
cess. He wisely eschews the paragraphic form in
which the poet Hayteb presents the statistics of
Victoria. Perhaps he has heard of that dreadful
day when, times being bad, every paragraph dis-
closed a corresponding falling-off from the return
of the previous year, and each of the inspired
Hayteb s accurate statements read like an indict-
ment of the Government which straightway in-
formed him that they were a great people, and
must be cracked up. Poor Mr. Hayteb ! The
astute Mr. Coghlan gives tables only and lets you
form what conclusions you like. If you are the
proud possessor of his 405 hugepagesof little figures
and big ones you can make quite a variety of pleas-
ing deductions for yourself. Indeed, you will follow
an excellent example in so doing, for Premier
Paekks led the way the other night at St.
Leonards and indulged himself in a number of
fairy visions of the future, for all of which Mr.
Coghlan’s figures were avowedly responsible.
• *
Let us imitate the imaginative statesman, and
disport ourselves awhile among deductions. It
appears, according to the Premier, that, at the
present rate of increase, the population of New
South Wales, which is now little over a million, will,
in 37 years, be close on five millions, in 62 years
12 millions, and in 87 years almost 32 millions and
a-half. All right. Now, Mr. Coghlan’s figures
also show a decreasing marriage-rate, for the mar-
riages per thousand of the population were, in
1883, 7.16 per 1000; in 1884, 6.74 per 1000; in
1885, 6.42 per 1000 ; in 1886, 6.16 per 1000 ; and in
1887, the last for which statistics are complete,
5.99 per 1000. In five years, therefore, the mar-
riage-rate has decreased from 7.16 per 1000 to 5 99
per 1000, or by considerably over one-seventh. At
this rate, long before New South Wales reaches
the latest of the three periods mentioned by Sir
Heney Parkes weddings will be entirely obsolete,
and this colony will have become like the
kingdom of heaven, where the Bible tells “ there
is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.” |_j|


As a country does not always depend entirely
upon the births for an increase of population, it is
not of so much consequence that the birth-rate
diminishes also, especially as the rate of diminu-
tion is slight. Still it may be worth while to
notice that the birth-rate has since 1883 fallen
from 37‘49 per 1000 to 36 42 per 1000. Seventeen
years before —in 1871— it was 39'63 per 1000, and
since that time it has, on the whole, steadily
diminished. The same process of reasoning which
leads Sir Henky Parkes to calculate that in 87
years New South Wales will have nearly
millions of people will enable him also to find out
the number of years in which, with a diminishing
birth rate, the population will reach the condition
described by the lady who said “it was hereditary
in her family not to have any children.”
# • •
There is, however, another aspect of this part of
the subject which to a moral man like Sir Henry
Paekes must be fraught with painful reflections.
That is the gradual but certain increase in the
proportion of illegitimate births—in other words,
the (immortal phrase !) “ Rise and Progress of the
New South Wales Benevolent Asylum 1” In 1883,
the rate of illegitimate births was 4 21 per cent. ;
in 1887 it was 4'59 per cent. It has steadily in-
creased since 1871, when it was only 3.88 per cent.
It is therefore a very simple matter of calculation
for anyone so expert as Premier Pabkks to prove
by reasoning from Mr. Coghlan’s undoubtedly
accurate returns—firstly, that the custom of mar-
riage will at no distant date become extinct in
New South Wales ; secondly, that in a somewhat
longer period children will cease to be born in the
colony ; and, thirdly, that long before births
entirely cease all the children born will be illegiti-
mate. Neither the figures nor the conclusions are
ours. The figures are those of Mr. Ooghlan, the
conclusions are arrived at by following the method
of Sir Hkney Paekbs.
♦ •
It is only just to a large and influential bcdy of
tradesmen to give them timely warning of a
coming change by which their interests will be
seriously affected. The tradesmen alluded to are
the fellow-craftsmen of that admirable and much-
respected orator Mr. Ninian Melville, whose
industry, necessary at present, will by and by be
extinguished, for how can the most energetic
undertaker bury the dead when there are no dead
left to bury ? The death-rate is diminishing with
a rapidity which however delightful to the people
of New South Wales must needs be alarming to
the masters of funereal ceremonies. The New
South Wales death-rate last year was only 13 15
to the 1000. It was 14'88 the year before and
16‘41 the year before that, and on the average of
17 years it was 15 40. Here be news indeed, and
glorious news, too, for everybody but heirs-at-law
and dealers in annuities. The time is coming, and
moreover, according to the method of reasoning
pursued by Premier Paekes, is not far off, when a
lease for life will mean a lease for ever, when in-
surance companies will have nothing to do, when
cemeteries will be closed, mortuary masons bank-
rupt, and the first columns of the daily papers will
be deprived of interest since nobody will die,
nobody be born, and nobody get married. What a
country it will be, to be sure, and what a fortunate
land is New South Wales to have a Premier whose
mode of reasoning leads to such brilliant and
satisfactory results !
•
When that blissful day shall have arrived—when
the entire population of New South Wales shall
be at once immortal and illegitimate, when births,
deaths, and marriages shall have ceased in the
land, and the Registrar-General’s duties be
lessened by the total abolition of vital statistics —
various other consequences will have come to pass
which are worthy of contemplation. The number
of landholders holding more than 10,000 acres
steadily increases, and that at a more rapid rate
than the growth of the total number. In 1883
there were in New South Wales 39,760 land-
owners, of whom 463 held more than 10,000 acres
each ; in 1888 there are 46,142 landowners, of
whom 566 hold more than 10,000 acres each. The
increase in the total number of landowners is a
little more than 13 per cent, in five years ■ The
increase in the number of large landholders is just
upon 20 per cent, during the same period ! The
date at which the operation of the larger rate of
increase will arrest, conquer, and absorb that of
the smaller rate can be easily ascertained by any
one who will follow out Premier Paekes’ infallible
method of deduction.
The immortal and illegitimate posterity of the
present population of New South Wales will be
well provided w ibh livs-stock, for the existing 47
millions of sheep will, according to their present
rate of increase and Sir Nordenfbldt Paekes’
mode of calculation, have attained the satisfactory
number of 48,128,000,000, which will give every
man, woman, and child of the great man’s 32
millions no less than 1504 illegitimate and possibly
immortal sheep each. But the citizens of that
epoch will not know the taste of beef unless they
import it, since the number of horned cattle
steadily decreased from 1879 to 1886, and, al-
though the process of decrease stopped during
1887, there does not seem to be much chance of
a turn of the tide. But the lack of beef will not
matter since there will be plenty of money to buy it.
The million of the New South Wales population
last year owned, according to Mr. Coghlan and Sir
Hkney Paekes, property of various kinds having
a total value of 1,015 millions sterling Adopting
the same method of calculation used by the Pre-
mier, that is merely taking it for granted that the
rate of increase which has characterised the past
will be maintained in the future, it follows that
the fortunate inhabitants of New South Wa’es in
1975 will be possessed of something like 600,000
millions sterling, which will give every inhabi-
tant, old and young, something like £lB,OOO in
hard cash.
• * •
There’s not much to fear in a future like this.
No marriages, therefore no mothers-in-law ; no
childbirth, consequently no monthly-nurses ; no
legitimate kindred, and so necessarily no squab-
bling about inheritance. Plenty of money, plenty
of meat, and plenty of large landowners to bow
down to and worship—what can the average Aus-
tralian want more ? Talking of worship,
by the way, brings forward the fact that
the average rate of attendance at church
increases in so much greater a proportion than the
growth of the population that the 32 millions and
a half of people who are to inhabit New South
Wales in 1975 will have to go to six churches a
day every day in the week to keep up with it. If
this is not the millennium it’s something very
nearly like it, and we ought to be very grateful to
know that it is so near at hand. Indeed, when
we come to think of it, we feel something of its
glories in advance. r ihe people of New South
Wales have Mr. Coghlan to describe to them how
great they are, and Sir Henry Paekes to
prophesy what wonderful people they will be, and
probably those two circumstances added together
make quite as much joy as could comfortably be
endured at present.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Frauds of Greece.
Bukke died too soon. Had he lived in the pre-
sent year of grace, in the sunbright land of New
South Wales, he would never have exclaimed :
“ The age of chivalry is dead !’’ Two humble
oystermen have saved this century from so foul a
reproach. With the specious aid of the succulent
bivalve immortalised by Lewis Carroll, two
descendants of Miltiades, two inheritors of the
glorious past of ancient Greece, have crowned the
labours of Peeicles with a coup de tramway
stroke of high diplomacy which bathes our age
in the golden atmosphere of noble statecraft.
Dreaming daily, mayhap, of Salamis and Ther-
mopylae, opening oysters amid visions of the spicy
Archipelago, dreaming dreams of the land of the
oily olive and the fruity fig, flooding their
artistic souls with memories of the opaline sky
which hangs its golden-fretted canopy athwart
the blue waters that lave lonian coasts, these
worthy children of Ulysses parted wide the shells
of tramway mis-managemtnt in sunny New South
Wales and extracted the juicy oyster of profit to
the tune of £2OOO. Oae of the Homeejd.e then
ostracised himself—after selling out of the oyster-
trade—and made tracks for the many-tinted isles
of lovely Greece. There is a poem in this, an
epic, an idyll, a romance, a lyric, a drama, a chef
d’oiuvre. To swindle ou so magnificent a scale
demanded talents hitherto found only in
the versatile accomplishments of an Auet-a-
lian mem Per of Parliament. What, in ’e<-r),
must be the sensations of this worthy in-
dividual at being dished by an oyster-split ter, a
low Greek, a purveyor of piscatorial mud-
fruit '! Is civilisation a failure, and is the Austra-
lian played out ? We fear so, and it all comes of
not being versatile enough. To the Greek nothing
is too great, nothing too small. In Beet Haete’h
parody of Disraeli's “ Coningsby,” the American
humourist makes his hero ascribe the success of
the Jews in everything they undertake by the ex-
planation that the Children of Israel never despise
any undertaking. With equal care and readiness
they contract to found an empire at 200 per
shent or float an orange-stall at the same figure.
The Greek is greater than the Australian swindler
because when he undertakes to be ■* on the job ” he
does not encase himself in a billy-cock bat, neither
weareth he fine apparel and much jewellery. He
simply squatteth at the seat of custom and thence
retails plates of shell fish and pints of periwinkles
the while he scoopeth the pool of the ungodly.
When his biz. is on the boom and everything
gloweth with a rosy hue he selleth out and de-
parteth for the land of love and song.

A Pica I'sr the Chinaman.
Referring to the recent prosecution of Ah Mow—
a Chinese agent for the dissemination of zymotic
disease in the town of Sandhurst, Victoria—
“ Vegetarian,” of Bendigo, writes as follows
Dear Bulletin,—l enclose paragraphs from the three
Sandhurst papers re the prosecution of An Mow for allow-
ing his premises to be in a filthy condition. For some
reason the case is not fully reported in any one of the
papers. I was in the Court during the hearing and
listened to the evideice of Constables Ryan and
O’Farrell ar.d of Dr. Hincholikf, which was to the
effect that they had found five pits of night-soil
mixed with blood in Ah Mows garden, and that the
vegetables vended by him were prepared for market by being
soaked in water mixed with nighlsoil. For this offence
Ah Mow was fined 55., though at the same court on the
same day Pat O Keefe was also fined ss. for merely being
drunk. Constable Ryan said; •• I found close to the
house two large jars full of putrid urine with roagg ts
moving in it, I also found five pits of nightsoil mix-d
with blood in the drains in the garden ; maggots were
moving about in this s tiff, and the ttenoh was strong ROO
yards from the place. I thereupon gave the defendant
notice to remove the filth. He did not do so, and I re-
ported the case to the doctor.” Dr. Hinchclifk oorro-
Doratei this evidence, and added that “ vegetables grown
in Ah Mow's garden would be very danger jus to health.”
An Mow was fined s>. Is this not farcical ?
This is something more than farcical; it is hor-
rible. It is all very well to object that Nature is
a wondrous alchemist, that the rose of Gul may
bloom in beauty on a hot-bed of disease, that the
modest violet may draw its perfume from the
breast of the dead leper, but we enjoy the beauty
of the rose and the perfume of the violet all the
more when we know that they havenotfed theirtints
and their scents on putrescence. Besides, we do
not eat roses or violets, and would not smell thim
with pleasure coming from such a source. We do,
however, eat “lettuc-ee” and “ cabbage-ee,”
green with a top-dressing of liquid manure which
has not gone through the transmuting process
from mould to vegetable-cell, and the deadly
character of which cannot be changed by a p;r-
functory washing in cold water at the hands of
Beidget Muephy, or even by boiling. Professor
Bastian, we think it was, who discovered
life-forms in organic substances submitted to
a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit. We
know that this thing is difficult to combat for
the white vegetable-vendor will buy from the
Chinaman all the while be can procure cheap
wares There is only one course open for those
who like clean food ; let every householder who
objects to Chinese-raised vegetable* subscribe to a
company for the purpose of buying a block of
land and growing white-tended kitchen-garden
stuff, and thus practically boycott the “cabbagee”
man.

“Is Marriage a Failure?”
Melbourne Heeald has had its soul shattered
and its soft emotions torn by the great marriage-
que.-tion which is, during the present season, going
the rounds of the press in default of well-
authenticated perjuries from valued corres-
pondents concerning the overworked snake.
Ladies have rushed headlong into the fray
and poured their sweet convictions into Editor
Winter's columns with a persistency and
callousness worthy of a tax collector : soulful
sylphlike things with appealing eyes and lips of
the rose-petal pattern who want to be married,
and tough and leather skinned old maids who pro-
test they would die before linking themselves to a
“horrid man,” and dames who have bloomed in
wedlock into florid maturity, and soured, crabbed
wives who have been thrashed and starved into
man-haters, and parson-loving females whose
hearts haye been turned against the “old man”
by the voice of the pietistic turtle, and whose
dreams of connubial bliss have been rudely
shattered by the ecclesiastical kiss of peace with
which church going ladies disturb the set of their
friz. - Amongst others who have plunged their
little feminine pens into the ink-bottle of contro-
versy is that well-known champion of “Women’s
Rights,” Mrs. Haebison-Lee (with a hyphen),
who so'emnly paints a frigid picture of polar
moenbeam happiness by marriage according to
the tenets of the Abelites. The letter is such a
funny one that it deserves immortality—as an
early specimen of unconscious humour in an Aus-
tralian woman. List to the wailful strain of the
Abelite, “ Bessie Lee ”
“Tha general reason given by the gentlemen for not
proposing seems to ba the one of small salaries, an 1 I
kno v that in many cases this objection holds good ; but
have we not often bsen told that two can live as cheap as
one? And this has been clearly proved. But, says one,
what about a possible family ? My advice to those who
cannot afford a family is not to have one. Marriage
should be a union of souls, a sweet companionship, a
mutual help and sympathy ; but marriage, as it is ’
Well, the end of the matter is that Mrs. Lee
advises poor people to live together platonically
and “know what genuine love and happiness
means. ’ And she concludes by
Trusting that my views may lead many to regard mar-
riage in a new light. I will close, first assuring my
re iders that it is because I so dearly love the gir's and
boys of our fair land, and so earnestly desire their
greatest happiness, that I have, after much consideration,
decided to write as I have done.
After reading this letter over one would naturally
ask : “ Why marry at all ?’’ Or, “Why should not
women marry each other, the old maid joined in
icy wedlock to the other old maid ‘I ’ Or, on the
above basis : Why should a man not have a dozen
wives, or a woman a dozen husbands, seeing it is
purely platonic and thoroughly make-believe ?
The truth is that not thus will the difficulty be
bridged There is no reason why a man should
not have dummy wives, but he will always pro-
bably yearn for one, or a fraction of one, of a bona-
fide and provokingly real description. As woman
has become purely a specialist (for you don’t find
now-a-days many of those homely old-fashioned
wives who could not only sing but also cook) there
is really no reason why a man should not have
teveral in order to thoroughly experience what it
means to ba married. He thus might have a wife
to dress and a wife to keep house, a wife for the
carriage, and a wife for drawing-room recaptions.
Indeed there is no limit to the number. He
might have a walking-costume wife, a winter-
costume wife, a wife for fancy dress carnivals, and
a wife for the apparel of the ordinary ball. To
make him _ perfectly happy he would require a
button-sewing wife and a chop-grilling wife, one
whose speciality was warming slippers and
another whose strong point was the wearing of a
spring-bonnet, and even then, perhaps, he would
be miserable. We are told that in Heaven there
is neither marriage nor giving in marriage The
cynical man will admit that that would he Heaven
indeed.
sir Anthony IMiisgravr,
The cynics of Queensland and Brisbane have just
had a prime treat. You might have to wait many
a long year before you had such a simple of the
false and canting twaddle which seeks to cover
itself under the sickeningly stale adage of De mor-
tuis nil nisi bomim. A few weeks ago, with
scarcely an exception, the Queensland Press was
running Sir Anthony for all he was worth as a
narrowminded, would-be despot. Now, all the
columns of the newspapers have turned the place
into one huge assembly of tomb-stones, lifting
their greasy lies up to the insulted heavens. From
the Brisbane Coueier downwards to the most
hopelessly obscure local weekly rag, the words
of yesterday give the lie direct to those of to-day.
Listen to this, and guess to whom it refers. A
certain person “ brought to bear on the Govern-
ment of a great and rising province qualities of
hears and intellect of which few Governors are
possessed. His social qualities were genial, and
his keen intellectualism was best appreciated by
those who had studied the literature alike of Eng-
land and France, America and Australia”
(Matthew Arnold, par parenlhese, denied that
America had a literature, and not even Sir
Henry Parkes has yet suggested that Australia
has one—
So far as his reign in is concerned, there
was nothing with wiish the most fast dious oould find
fa iU, exoep: perhipt in the attitude he assumed in the
K itt case. But de mortuis nil nisi bonum. He has gone
from amongst us, and we prefer to remember him for his
gracious presence, his courtly manner, his unaffected
sweetntss, and his beautiful gentiemanliness.
It seems incredible that all this balderdash was
written about Sir Anthony Musgkave, or by the
fditorialpen of the leading daily of Queensland.
But it was. There is not a single statement
made, that truth does not compel one to traverse.
Sir Anthony Mdsgrave was a man of the nar-
rowest caste ideas and caste sympathies. His
“qualities of heart and intellect” were those
proper to a man who.e career is a shameless
sample of the manner in which the caste rule of
England, founded on the abject subservience of
the ruled, is carried on. Tne list of the ap-
pointments he held is astonishing. For a public
career of some 30 years they run thus ; —Treasurer-
Acc mutant of Antigua, Colonial Secretary of
Antigua, Administrator of Nevis, Administrator
of St. Vincent, Governor of Newfoundland,
Governor of British Columbia, Governor of
Natal, Governor of South Australia, Governor
of Jamaica, Governor of Queensland. And
in every one of these he manifested the same
profound want of sympathy with the people he
“ governed ” that made his rule in Adelaide as in
Brisbane that of a highly paid nonentity ! To
call his “ social qualities genial ’’ is quite comical.
At one of his wife’s last receptions not a single
visitor put in an appearance. Sir Anthony’s
“ geniality ” was too much for them. His “keen
intellectualism ” was evidenced by a little
idle dabbling in third-rate contemporary litera-
ture. His wife was an American, and he had
held two long Governorships in America,
but the calibre of his “studies” in “American
literature ” may be judged from the fact that he
looked upon that greasy, clap trap, “ popular
universal knowledge ” sausage-machine, known as
the Chantauqua University, as the ideal of culture!
The man as he was was just an average sample of
the painfully narrow and effete social type which
a grovelling navion once worshipped as “the
English gentleman !” “ Only that, and nothing
more.”
Deuieby's Ke-burlal.
Editor Bulletin, —Your correspondent, “ V.R.,”
endeavours to maintain, in The Bulletin, of a
fortnight since, that Deniehy's re-burial was not
the evidence of inconsistency on the part of the
authorities of the Roman Catholic Church that
you would have your readers believe. “V.R.”
bases his argument on three points—first, that
ecclesiastical law may, like secular law, undergo
many and important changes, and that it may be
increased or decreased in severity as occasion re-
quires ; second, that the sentence of the Church,
pronounced by her pastor, was fulfilled when
Deniehy’s remains were committed to the earth
23 years ago at Bathurst without the rites of the
Church; and, third, that the Church has, in
reality, taken no part in his re-burial, since the
ceremonies Were celebrated by the Eianciscan
Brothers, acting. he would endeavour to show, in-
dependently. Now, as to his first point—“ the
changes of ecclesiastical law ” —the law of the
Church is the same to-day on this particular
subject as it was 23 years ago ; certainly it is
placed in the hands of a bishop or priest as the
case may be, to be adjudged alike to rich and
poor—truly a great confidence to be reposed in one
man ! As to the necessity for the rigid enforce-
“t of, the law in question, I think that even
\.R. will admit that it is as great at the pre-
sent time as it was 23 years ago—perhaps greater.
Mis second argument is equally baseless. The
ceremonies of the Church were withheld through
the action of the pastor at Deniehy’s funeral ; his
| lf e held up as an example, an awful warning
to the faithful; his remains were cast into the
ground unwept, unhonoured, and unsung” to
await the “ corning'of his Maker and now, after
a lapse of 23 years, the once denied rites are per-
formed over his decayed remains. Why ? Has the
tact that the flesh has rotted from his frame
altered the circumstances of the case, or do the
authorities of the R.C. Church consider that a
mistake was made in at first refusing the funeral
rites, and wish to make some reparation to the
’a bones ? To his bones I say, for by
1 V.R s. ’ own showing the rites in question do
not affect the soul; they are merely a “matter of
form a weapon of intimidation to the faithful,
to be used at pleasure. “ V.R’s. ” third point,
the fact that the ceremonies, at Waverley
Cemetery, were celebrated by the Franciscan
Brothers, the “ free-lances ” of the Church, as he
terms them—will not bear investigation. Does he
mean to say that the Franciscan Brothers, or any
other religions order, would act, independently,
against the wishes of the Bishop in whose diocese
they were placed ? Assuredly not ! And I think,
in the present case, I am correct in saying that
the ceremonies were celebrated by the Franciscan
Brothers at Waverley Cemetery, with the full
knowledge and consent of the highest dignitary
of the RC. Church in Australia. Deniehy’s re-
burial was, doubtless, a grossly inconsistent act on
the part of the authorities of the R.C. Church.
The talented unfortunate was, 23 years ago, de-
prived of Christian burial by a clergyman -one of
the 1 ranciscan Order, I believe —anathemas were
hurled at the head of a gentleman who dared to
read the funeral service at the grave, and now,
after 23 years have elapsed, his supposed remains
are carefully gathered and deposited with full
religious ceremonies i n Waver.'ey Cemetery through
the action of several well-known Sydney citizens.
Deniehy picked up in the gutter, a penniless
wretch, an unfortunate drunkard, is beneath
the notice of the pastors of the Church—he is a tit
subject for their scorn only. At his death his
body is thrown into the condemned ground with-
out even, as far as they are concerned, a prayer ;
but when several socially influential men, moved
by a patriotic desire, take the matter in
hand, his decayed remains are suddenly
deemed worthy of religious burial. Need more
be said on the subject? Facts speak for them-
selves ! I would leave your readers to judge
whether the authorities of the Church acted
through a sense of charity or through worldly in-
fluence. Far batter, it would have been, to have
allowed poor Deniehy s remains to rest in the
Potter’s Field at Bathurst, there, among the
bones of murderers from the scaffold, to await the
sound of the last trump. And perhaps it may ba
seen, when all—rich and poor, clergyman and lay-
man alike—stand before the Judgment-seat, that
the talented miserable has at least as honourable
a page written in the great Book of Life as have
many of the Church’s seemingly consistent (?)
followers.—Yours, E.

Westward ilo
Deak Bulletin, — Rip Van Winkle awoke 20
years ahead. The man who is transplanted from
one of the Eastern colonies to Western Australia
finds himself 50 years back. Fremantle is an
antiquated-looking place with old-fashioned stone
houses and convicts working in the streets —re-
minding one of the old-world pictures of old-time
Sydney. Perth is still worse in these respects.
The despotic Governor lives there and is sur-
rounded by a circle of Government House toadies
known as “ the six families,” whose male members
are pitchforked into the best billets quite irre-
spective of capacity ; such things, however, are
not utterly unknown under Responsible Govern-
ment. In regard to hotels, even Eastern Aus-
tralia is not too well off; but at Perth, at the
supposed leading hotel, my first lunch consisted of
some vile fish, salt hirse, and unco iked cold
mutt an. The attendant! were two Polynesians—
an old one and a young one—in sweaty pyjama
suits. Somebody wanted some mutton ; the
younger one commenced to saw at the leg, but
tailed to get any off, and this so excited the wrath
of the elder that he addressed words to him in the
Polynesian tongue which nearly brought on bicod-
shed. Then the elder pushed the younger away,
and hacked at the joint himself until he had sawn
off a lump, which was handed to the applicant.
A small bottle of claret cost 4s. Gd. This was
Australian-grown claret, Is, Gd. anywhere else.
All power being centred in one man, who cannot
oversee everything, queer things are done daily.
For instance, a contract is let for the carrying of
mails to an important pastoral district, and the
contractor cannot read or write ; at least not well
enough to read the addresses on letters. He em-
ploys a man to drive, who cannot read or write at
all; in consequence the letters are thrown down
for every enquirer to “ take his pick, and help
himself.” This mail-route covers over 300
miles, so you can faintly imagine the consequences.
The local tax-system is unique. If you own a dog
of any sort you have to pay registration fee, as in
the East, but if your dog comes under the denomi-
nation of a “lap-dog” you have to pay an extra
per-centageforit; and if you possess a wheelbarrow
you have co pay a tax on it as a wheeled vehicle.
Beyond taxation and the retention of all Govern-
ment billets in the hands of the “six families”
aforesaid, the Government of the “ Crown c dony ”
has no idea of legislation. Telegraph-lines
have been erected through districts devoid of
habitation, whilst in the interior the traveller
is as much cut off from communication with the
outer world as he would ba if he were with Emin
Bey. Through a desolate sea-coast track, where
Grey nearly lost bis life in the old days, the line
has been carried to the detriment of the pastoral
districts to the eastward, whose inhabitants have
seemingly been considered quite unworthy of con-
sideration We are in the habit of hearing of the
great pearl-shelling industry of W.A. As a
matter of fact, almost every boat is owned by
N.S.W. men and Queenslanders, The pearlers
have to pay duty on all stores transferred to their
schooners (lying some 10 miles from land),
although the goods are never landed, and would
be considered as in bond anywhere else. And they
have to pay on all imported shell, even though it
never touches land.—Yours,
W. S.
The British Constitution appear j to
out official woe with the greatest nicety. The
death of an Australian Governor is mourned with
the tiring of 17 minute-guns, no more and no less.
A European monarch, as was very recently
shown, gets one gun for every year of his life, so
if the infant King of Spain were to suddenly ex-
pire from a surfeit of royal pap our revenue
would merely be saddled with the 'cost of two ex«
plosions.

Wellington (N.Z.) has enjoyed 74 earth-

the southern hemisphere, but, no doubt, the New

impression that it would amuse him.
Mr. L. J. Brient, of the Sydney Daily
Telegraph, is a tolerably experienced smoker and
until now has rather fancied himself as a judge of
cigars. The other day in France an “American
gentleman ” gave him a cigar and asked him to
smoke the same and state his opinion of it. Mr.
Brient took the cigar and after a fair trial gave it
as his verdict that it was a beautifully-flavoured,
well-seasoned, mild Havanna. It was closely and
neatly rolled, drew freely, burnt slowly and evenly,
and gave a nice white ash that lasted until three-
fourths of the cigar had been consumed. The
Yankee said that Brient’s opinion agreed with
that of numbers of experienced cigar-smokers
whom he had consulted about the same brand, but
that all the same the cigar was made not of
tobacco but of brown paper, shaped, pressed,
coloured, flavoured and stamped with the little
veins and tracery of the true tobacco-leaf, rolled
and dried with the most perfect appliamces, packed
in the regulation boxes, exported under Govern-
ment supervision and sold as a medium quality
Havanna cigar. Well, if we have wooden fhams,
why not brown-paper cigars ?
Mr. Phil. May.
Mr. Phil May, who with his amiable wife left
Australia last week by the Orizaba, did not depart
through any lack of pecuniary inducement on the
part of The Bulletin proprietary, by whom he
was engaged in London three years ago, to stay
here. He has gone from this country simply be-
cause he has an ambition above mere money. No
finer draughtsman or more gifted character artist
than Mr. May has ever left England for “ abroad.”
But Mr. May is not content with being a mere
draughtsman—he means to become a painter.
Nine years ago, when a boy of but 15, he left
Yorkshire for London with a yearning to be
known as a distinguished member of the profession
to which he felt he had been born. He had made
sketches ever since his early childhood, but had had
no regular lessons in art; he studied from Nature
and learned as he went along. By-and-by he got
to work as a designer of theatrical costumes, then
he went on the stage as a comedian, and turning
his attention to caricature in his leisure time he
became almost as well known as any youth of 20
years could hope to be in the great world of Lon-
don, as a genius in the art of caricature. Now he
is 24 years old, and with all the world before him.
He will continue to contribute to The Bulletin,
and hopes in a year or two to be able to send to a
Melbourne gentleman who has promised him a
thousand guineas for the first picture he succeeds
in exhibiting at the Royal Academy, a painting
which will recall to the mind of Australia an inci-
dent which, when it occurred, was on all lips.
But it is not alone by Mr. May’s artistic genius
that his memory will be kept green in this
country. A recollection of his kindly and generous
nature will be affectionately treasured by hun-
dreds of sincere friends.

The Mount Morgan Goldmine has declared
a dividend of Is. a share (or £50,000) upon its million
shares. This is from the old works only ; gold
from the new work", it is said, will not be avail-
able for a month. It is just about time that this
much advertised companv did something in the
way of dividends to justify the recent ruling
prices of its shares, which we notice have during
the last few weeks sustained a heavy fall Queens-

The student of Colonial Statistics will find
some curious items in the N.S.W. Blue Book for
1887. Amongst others that Sir Alfred Stephen,
as ex-Chief Justice, receives £lB2O per annum,
while Sir Wm. Manning, as an ex-puisne Judge,
gets exactly the same amount for a much shorter
period of service and in addition draws the neat
little sum of £BOO annually for services as
Attorney-General under the old Imperial system.
Sir Alfred Stephen, after his 35 years’ service as a
Judge, receives £BOO a year less than does Sir
William for his much shorter service as Attorney
General and puisne Judge ! There is something
about this to ponder over. Another distinguished
pensioner is one Mr. Mereweather, who has care-
fully drawn £9OO a year since 1856—just 33 years !
We also note that our old friend the poet Halloran
has been drawing £BOO for the past 10 years, but
in this particular it must be remembered that the
old gentleman has inflicted his poetry upon and
given his valuable official services to a suffering
country for 60 long years.

Fact !
The Bulletin's Illustrated History of
Botany Bay has this week been issued at the
popular price of one shilling. The greater part of
the first edition of 20,000 copies having already
been absorbed by trade orders from all parts of
Australasia, it is quite evident that this, the first
attempt to present to the Australian public
in book-form a reliable history of her
past and an exposition of those principles
which since the memorable Soudan fiasco
have rendered a sentiment of nationalism
possible, has been a remarkable success. More-
over, it proves that it is not unprofitable to
tell the truth and shame the devil of tradi-
tional bygones. It proves that a book free
from the honey of lies and flattery is as readily
sold as one which prepares its clientele by pro-
pitiating the powers that be, and it proves, too,
that The Bulletin is, throughout the Australias,
recognised as the avant courier of a national
future and a glorious destiny free from the stain
of the iron-gyved Past.

On Saturday last Mr. George C. Miln
drew the awful circle of his solemn church around
Her Majesty’s (Sydney), and demonstrated with
Seat force an axiom which we, when thinking of
ajor-General Richardson, are not likely to
seriously dispute, viz., that the pen is a vastly
superior weapon to the Nordenfeldt. Mr. Miln’s
acting is full of vitality and passion, and he repre-
sented the Cardinal-King of France as a very fine
old tyrant whom we could better appreciate on
the stage than in our domestic circle in the
character of a father. The one specially enjoyable
feature of Richelieu was the deft manner in which
he sat on the gilded chests of monarchs and clove
to the waist Englishers who had no right to inter-
fere with his profession as business-manager of the
French nation. The delightful way in which the
Kyardinal indulges in chiackery with the haughty
nobles of the Gallic Court, and invites them to have
their beards trimmed without the intervention of
a barber is highly commendable, and calculated
to subserve all the principles of morality, besides
being eminently ,conducive to the cooling of hot
feet. Mr. Miln looks every inch a Cardinal with
a tendency to swoons, but we wish he would not
strike a nineteenth-century table-gong whenever
he wants the attendance of his blood-stained myr-
midons. Miss Louise Jordan looked beautiful
enough to undermine the tottering paternity
of half-a-dozen cardinals, and delivered her
speech in the light of a stage-moon with
considerable fervour. As Baradas, the naughty
courtier who conspires against everybody in his
professional capacity as the villain of the play, Mr.
Jewett was far and away ahead of all the rest of
the caste, but seemed a little off in his conception
of the eharactt r by wearing the flaxen wig.of virtue
instead of the raven horsehair of vice. The good
boy of the drama, Adrian de Mauprat, was
carried through to bliss and ever-afterwards on
the shoulders of Mr. Walter Howe, who affronted
all the traditions of the stage by making a hero
jump around with sable curls. It is well
known that good young men always grow
golden locks upon their baby brows, and a blonde
moustache always droops athwart their pinky
cheeks. In addition to this crime, Mr. Walter
Howe hops about a deal too much for a hero, and
puffs and snorts and gesticulates to such an extent
that everybody is sorry when Richelieu allows
him to dodge the headsman. For the rest every-
body looked pretty and wore all the gar-
ments they could seize belonging to an age
when men dressed up like wax dolls. The King
was moderately good—that is, good enough for a
king, and very much like the thing we always
imagined a king to be —and the remainder of the
characters got through the piece without missing
their cues to any appreciable extent, or sitting
down on the lime-light, or otherwise injuring the
tout ensemble of the scenic menagerie. On the
whole, “ Richelieu ” assuageth our soul.

The “Spanish Muleteers” at Sydney
Gaiety were probably so named because they don’t
even pretend to be Spanish and because their show
contains no vestige of an honest, unaffected mule,
the company preferring to present that animal in
his disguised form, and to endow him with an
aspect not his own. The show is more military
than mule, in fact, and the actors are got up as
shedders of blood at Is, a day, and they keep
things going by asking each other to sing. A
group of officers carouse out of common pint-pots
in the background ; an organisation described as
the “Military and Tramway Band” bash the
tinkling cymbal away in the rear; and the
rest is melody rather old melody, too.
Fred. England enquires about the present
location of the boys of the Old Brigade,
and pretends not to know that most of them are
in gaol for stealing wood, and the rest are dead-
broke or else paralysed. Mr. Hastings piles up
the agony of the inevitable “ Australia !” Mr.
Clay supplies “ White wings,” and Robinson fills
up the old tale of “A Soldier and a Man” —a
combination which is often found to be of less
practical use than a cook and a boy. Harry
Carroll, Alf. Moynham, Miss Bell Stuart, and a
tired semblance of Horace Bent are the chief
remaining features of the show —excepting Miss
Nellie Symonds, a clever little actress who
ought to have better luck. There are pro-
bably lots of disguised gocd points about the
“ Spanish Muleteers,” but we are of opinion
that that combination would get on better in a
sitting position. Under present arrangements it
stands up all the time and folds its arms across its
chest with a sternness that seriously threatens to
rend its coat asunder, and when it isn’t doing this
it is shifting from one leg to the other and looking
exhausted. Two infants in tight boots are a
pretty feature of the show, and in various other
ways the cold east wind is tempered to the shorn
audience. The stray visitor doesn’t necessarily
die in the house, and the management takes all
possible and reasonable measures to alleviate the
horrors of the scene. The business interests of
the concern are carefully looked after by a long
and clamorous human being at the door, and,
providing he doesn’t come to an untimely end by
knocking his head against the roof, this gentleman
may yet have a long and useful career in front of
him.

Another association of disorganised ruins
appeared and sang and fled in front of a thin
audience at Sydney Academy on Monday night.
It is generally understood that they don’t intend
to repeat the performance for some time. A vague
impression prevails that this last combination of
wreckage is indirectly connected with the remains
of something which attempted to play “Fun on
the Bristol ” at the same emporium a week pre-
viously ; at all events, it has inherited all the
lugubriousness of that great sorrow upon the sea,
and the two shows have a similarity of feature
which suggests that they are brothers. The first
part of the recent hearse consisted of four songs,
and the “world-famed ventriloquist” followed
close behind. He perspired less than he did last
week, and looked a trifle less agitated, but still he
was husky and unsettled and obviously glad to get
away. The “ celebrated acrobatic song-and-dance
artiste ” then rushed athwart the programme, but
the house did not receive that famous child of
music so cordially as might have been expected.
He was dressed in a petticoat made out of two old
curtains and waved the flinders of an umbrella in
the face of society, and he was possessed of several
gags of great age. He sang in a woefully dismal
strain and turned two somersaults and then re-
moved himself off the stage. Another dark person,
who was sadder and more depressed still, warbled
a long paragraph and went away in a condition of
deep despondency. The orchestra which used to
pound out the melodious jig at the Academy has
left, but the proceedings were enlivened to some
extent by the action of a gentleman who flogged
a piano at the back of the stage. This musical
artiste stuck to his post like a Roman father, and
his noble self devotion to some extent alleviated
the general downfall.

The other Sydney shows present no ele-
ments of an amazing character. “Sithors to
Grind ” will be ground no longer at the Criterion
after Friday, and “ In Chancery ” will ensue in
its stead, with Misses Myra Kemble, Maggie
Oliver, Brenda Gibson, Ida Herberte, Messrs.
Anson, Robert Brough, Harris, and the rest of the
mighty combination known as the Brough and
Boucicault Comedy Company to keep it afloat.
“In Chancery ” is a yelp of deathless merriment
by Pinero, and, if report can be trusted,
it is eminently suited to cheer the heart
of man. The “ Tomboy ” also falls on its
fierce red ear at Her Majesty’s, and i f s place is
taken by the “Miner’s Daughter a piece which
is worth 1.000 “ Tomboys,” even though they fell
into 700 tanks unto 70 times seven. This latter
is a Scriptural figger of speech. At the Crystal
Palace Rink the patient Wyburd takes a benefit
on the 31st inst., but the public mind now yearns
for the balmy aquarium and the cool, damp,
slimy seal, and the cold, collected shark, rather
than for the frantic tear of the roller-skater,
and the rinking season is about to close.
Meanwhile the Bondi establishment is look-
ing up in its nook among the sandhills,
and the invigorating breeze blows odours
like those of ancient Gilead over the Switchback
railway where passengers are carried across “ from
cliff to cliff without danger, daily.” It is difficult
to grow poetic over an aquarium, but the above is
a vigorous effort in that direction.

vent of Mr. A. W. Filson and Miss Lee Errol,
“ sketch and comedy artists,” and iheir come-

from the beaten tracks of nigger minstrelsy by
producing “ Nan, the Gcod-for-Nothing,” as a
concluding item, and it has taken well and given
pleasure to all. This is positively the last time
this well known metaphor will appear in these

The well known figure of Captain Gingah
will delight Australian play goers no more.
Johnny Hall, who created so many screams of
merriment in times past by his representation of
the impecunious officer, died last week of con-
sumption in Melbourne Hospital, and in this, and
many other characters, there is no man left in the
colonies to fill his place. Twenty years have now
elapsed since Mr. Hall came to Australia, and
during the whole of that period he has
been a public favourite of the deepest
dye. He was twice married, his first wife
being Miss Emily Wiseman, of the troupe known
as the Wiseman Family, and his second-
who survives him, Miss Jessie Grey, a favourite
actress whose name is well-known throughout
Australia, especially in connection with her
splendid representation of Grirolet in the “ Tam-
bour Major.” Mr. Hall was one of the great host
of high-class artists who make little profit out of
their art. The large sums which he realised from
time to time were invariably swallowed up by un-
lucky speculations, and he was alternately
rolling in luxury and dead- broke. He began life
in a circus, and by the aid of genius _ alone he
reached the highest rank in his profession. All
through his career he was a Bohemian to the core,
and with his death a brilliant tradition has been
consigned to the property-room of oblivion. His
last appearance was as the first grave-digger in
“Hamlet” at Melbourne Princess, and when he
abandoned the part his own grave was nearly
ready.

Mr, Melton Prior, special war artist for
the Illustrated London News, delivered two
lectures in Melbourne Town Hall last week. They
were—in The Bulletin language of truth—dark
and dismal failures, the second lecture being so
poorly attended that the whole audience was in-
vited to contract itself into the front seats, irre-
spective of petty distinctions as regards prices
paid for admission. Mr. Melton Prior opened the
proceedings by signifying his deep disgust at so
few people being there, but after about five
minutes of lecture the few who were there
found themselves pondering over the ques-
tion of why they hadn’t stopped away.
Mr Prior is an aggressive, bald-headed,
little gentleman in glasses. His entertainment
consists of showing enlarged reproductions of
sketches on a sheet, while he reads a disjointed
sermon explaining what it is all about. The
matter of this sermon is drivel, interlarded with
nauseous references to our soldier Prince (the
Duke of Connaught) and the British Crown. But
the subject is too contemptible to dwell upon. It
is not a matter for regret that Mr. Prior was
frozen hard in Melbourne. We want no more war
correspondents and special artists to spread the
miserable gospel of Guns and Glory in this
hemisphere. Battlefield “ glory ”is an iniquitous
bubble, the professional soldier is a sin in the
sight of God, and campaigns are a bloodstained
shame.
♦* * *
If Mr. Alfred Dampier were a minstrel
entertainment then Melbourne Alexandra might
be more generally full up than it is at present,
nevertheless things are looking healthy as times
go. On Saturday the company held a mirror up
to Nature in “The Green Lanes of England,” a
drama which contains one well-drawn character
and a quantity of appalling incident. Mr. Alfred
Dampier, in his old part of Gentleman George,
threw a glamour of reality over several occurrences
that stood in urgent need of his moral support,
and when he declaimed “ The Charge of the
Light Brigade,” he carried the whole house
away on a whirlwind of passion. But the
voice of this sterling actor is a continual feast.
Messrs. Boothman, Baker, Stark, and Watkin
Wynne (there is a Sir Watkin of that ilk) are
also intelligent and intelligible, but Mr. Edmund
Holloway distinctly fails to make himself heard in
the large space. A certain want of go holds back
several of the ladies, and even Miss Lily Dam-
pier discounts the merit of her performance by
dropping into the Jenyns baritone. After this
week the management will set up William Shake-
speare on Friday nights, plays to be voted for by
ballot like members of Parliament.

“ Hands Across the Sea ” booms along as
usual at the Royal, but several other shows are
suffering from Exhibition. The bright Bijou
comedies —not sufficiently inartistic to fetch the

To-morrow Titheradge takes a benefit in “ David
Garrick,” and on Saturday sweet “ Sophia,” whose
father persists in smelling as he chooses on his own
premises, will take up the thread of success where
it was dropped a few months back. The Opera
House was the scene of another drama on Satur-
day night, but nobody appeared to be much
affected by this circumstance except certain mem-
bers of the new Italian Opera Company, who sat
in the dress-circle and lost themselves in be-
wildering mazes of inscrutable plot.

At the Princess’s a sorrowful event will
transpire on Friday, the 19 th, when beauteous
Essie Jenyns appears for positively the last time.
As a matter of hard fact popular interest in this
fair blossom has been falling off slightly, owing
to a widespread rumour that her voice and manner
become monotonous after long acquaintance.
Which again reminds us that Essie generally
sacrifices sense to sound in her delivery of blank
verse. Her long speeches leave no more im-
pression on the mind than does the echo of a song
sung afar off. But, on the other hand, several
members of her suite, notably Mr. Stewart, have
of late put a pleasing polish on their diction. The
full strength of the Triumvirate’s comic opera
company opens here on Saturday in “Olivette.”

The Coghill Brothers and John Gourlay
have fixed up a taking trifle at St. George’s Hall
called “ The Brook.” An introductory act leads
up to a prettily-staged picnic at which everybody
obliges with a song, and sometimes several of
them oblige at one time. Finally, the picnic con-
cludes in a thunderstorm, and the curtain de-
scends on a heavy shower of real rain. It is more
impressive than the tank.

At the Adelaide Royal, Mr. Darrell’s
“ Mystery of a Hansom Cab ” has done a week,
and, although the business has not been altogether
brisk, the drama has merit in it. Bland Holt,
with a big company, opens in “ Taken from Life,”
and George Darrell wends his way to Broken
Hill. The Jungfrau Kapelle have had a real good
time of it at the Town Hall, considering all
things. Hiscocks and Friedmann have an excel-
lent show at Garner’s Theatre, but the people will
not turn up as they should —silence and repent-
ance prevail.

In a general sort of way we don’t like
things presided over by saints, and the recent
performance of Byron’s comedy, “ A Hundred
Thousand Pounds,” by St. Joseph’s Literary and
Dramatic Society at Newtown (Sydney), confirms
us in this sentiment. We don’t profess to know
much about St. Joseph, but judging of him by the
capacity of his followers we conclude that he was
no great shucks as a comedian. Beyond the fact
that a number of young men were visible stagger-
ing about beneath gigantic moustaches made of
the inside of a mattress, there was nothing in the
show that anyone could get hold of, but the audi-
ence being in a good-natured mood no deaths
ensued.

Spring’s Delusions.
If there is anything in Nature which can awaken
enthusiasm and arouse the heart of men and
women, it is to be found at the present season of
the year. Poets have sung about it; artists have
§one wild over it, and meanwhile the beautiful
pring has gone on luring people to their graves.
Under every blade of springing grass is the germ
of death. Beneath every budding tree lurks the
demon of disease. It is not necessary to enquire
why this is so; it is sufficient to know that it is
so. And that it is so, the languid feeling of
nearly every individual amply shows. The
sluggish condition of the blood; the malarial
poisons which are drawn in with every breath;
and the germs of disease that are absorbed in in-
numerable ways all prove the dangerous nature of
the season that divides the Winter and Summer.
But the query naturally arises : “ How can
this be prevented ? ” The Spring comes every
year and must be met. It may be dangerous, but
how can it be avoided ? There is plainly but one
way, and that is by keeping the system in the
proper condition to repel these influences. Nor is
this an easy undertaking. Indeed, for years it has
been a study, not only with the public, but with
the most eminent physicians, how this most desir-
able end might be attained. If the vitality is
weak, the poisons in the atmosphere have an easy
task. If, on the contrary, the vitality is strong,
these evil tendencies are of no effect, but are re-
pelled frcm the system and fall away harmless.
It is not our purpose to lay down a rule of action
for anyone, but observation and the careful ex-
perience of hundreds have shown that for putting
the body in a condition where its vitality can
throw off the enemies of health and retain its
strength, there is nothing equal to Warner’s safe
cure. This remedy is not a cure-all, but it
possesses the unquestioned power of fortifying the
system, and so invigorating it that it can resist
the inroads of disease and death. Can anything
more be asked of any medicine 1 When the body
is bowed by pain ; when the food fails to assimil-
ate ; when a dull, laflguid sensation is experienced
and life seems a buraen ; when appetite is a thing
unknown, or must be coaxed to have even an
existence, and when something must be done in
order that life may be even endurable, if a pala-
table preparation can be secured that will remove
all these evils, is it not a blessing ? It is just here
that the evils of Spring should be met and can be
overcome. It is not a privilege but a duty, and
one which will take no denial. Procrastination
may be pardoned when only money is at stake,
but when human life and happiness are involved
it is too serious a matter to admit of trifling. It
is then that some action must be taken that may
avert impending disaster and avoid Spring’s
subtle dangers.

A Finished Crime.
[FROM THE FRENCH OF JEAN RICHEPIN.]
For ben years before the day when he became a
rascal Oscar Lapissote had dwelt upon the sixth
floor of a tenement house in the Rue St. Denis.
Lost in the midst of some thirty or more locataires,
known only by one of his numberless pseudonyms,
he had for a friend a gossiping bonne, who re-
counted to him, when opportunity offered, all her
own and her mistress’ little affairs. This mistress,
being an aged, semi-invalided widow of consider-
able wealth, who had only been there some two
months altogether, was quiet, retiring, and with
the exception of the physician who attended her
as much of a stranger in the city as in the house
Thus matters stood when one evening, as
Lapissote was going out after visiting a friend, a
patient in the I’ibie, he recognized lying in one of
the outer wards the bonne of the old window,
whom for several weeks, he remembered that he
had not seen. She called him and he entered to
speak to her. “ She was very ill,” she told him,
after talking a while, “ and had been absent from
her employer's nearly a month. Her place was
temporarily filled by the concierge, assisted by a
charwoman—her mistress was too infirm to visit
her—she was desolate 5”
“Of course, ” said Omar, “ you are lonely—you
wish to see her '!■ ”
“Yes, bub it is not so much for that I am
desolate; it is because lam afraid that madame,
should I die here, will read the letters that I have
received while with her and scorn me when I am
gone 1”
“Why should she scorn you?” asked Oscar,
surprised.
‘ ‘ Listen, ” answered the bonne; “I will tell
you everything, for you loved me once ; it is
passed now, so long ago that I can speak to you
frankly and ask assistance. Ah, well, it is this i
I had another lover in the house, nob a gentleman
like you but a man of my own rank, the coach-
man of the lower floor. If madame knew it I
should be lost for I have done such evil things
for him, the scoundrel. I was mad, bub you see
he was the father of my child ; he promised to
recognize it, to marry me •„ it was for that I did as
he wished. He lied. I know it now when too
late, but the little one should not suffer for my
sins. I have written to madame that I had a
child ; she is good, she will cafe for it—that is if
my papers, are burned beforehand. She would be
pitiless if she knew my guilt, and that he, the
child, was the son of a gougardine and a thief —”
“ Wait, my friend, wait !” cried Oscar ; “you go
too fast; you confuse everything; be more ex-
plicit. If lam to aid you, and I ask nothing
better if possible, you must tell me clearly from
the Iteginning !. ”
And at the moment Lapissote was honest, not
thinking of crime, and yielded simply to the
curiosity of a writer, a professional scenting a
romance and preparing copy.
“I must be very brief,” replied the bonne. “ I
fell, as I told you, without warning on the street,
with an attack of apoplexy. They brought me here
to the hospital. I was unable to be moved and
madame was forced to leave me here, but she does
not and must not know what it is that is worrying
me — my papers, a packet of the coachman’s
letters, villainous letters, full of wickedness that I
have done at his council, of which he speaks and
thanks me ; of things he has carried away, of the
money I have stolen—yes, stolen from my mistress
for him. I ought to have burned them, but I
kept them because they were full of promises for
me and the little one. I feared him and that if
master of those papers all would be ended for me.
To guard them from him I confined them to the
the care of my mistress as family papers. They
are in her secretary, in a drawer—l have the key.
I dare nob trust the concierge to bring them to
me. There is no one, no one, I say, to do me a
service but you, if you will be so kind ! ”
“ Certainly, Blanche ; but the service, what is
it ? ”
“ To bring them to me.”
“I, my girl, I ? How ?”
“ Very easily. Every evening by ten o’clock
madame has taken the chloral that makes her
sleep. She sleeps heavily and alone. The woman
who is in my place leaves her as soon as dinner is
served and cleared. Madame, fearing thieves,
has told no one but me that she takes this sleeping
draught (in me, poor soul, she had every confi-
dence). Enter then; she will nob hear you.
Secure the package and bring it to me, bub enter
by the staircase of service, that the concierge may
nob see you. Promise me to do this, I beseech, I
entreat !■”
“You are mad, Blanchette, mad and foolish.
How could I pass the door of the apartment or
open the secretary ? ”
“ The keys to the staircase and kitchen by
which I enteied are here, also the key to the little
drawer and a duplicate—bo my shame I confess
it—to the secretary itself. Take them and bring
me my letters, that I may die in peace.”
Lapissote accepted bhp keys like a man in a
dream, his eyes fixed, a, sudden pallor upon his
features, the muscles of his face twitching ner-
vously. The feasibility, nay, possibility, of the
coveted crime had dawned upon him like a revela-
tion. This woman dead it would be easy to
execute.
“I choke—l strangle!” cried Blanchette
hoarsely; the long conference had exhausted
her. “ Give me a drink—some 'water to wet my
lips!” The dormitory lighted by a single taper
was in shadow, the night watch absent, the in-
mates of neighbouring beds wrapped in slumber.
As if to do her bidding, Lapissote leaned over
the sick one, and with a quick movement drew
the pillow across her face and held it there with
a hold of iron. When at last he lifted himself and
readjusted the clothing, Bl&nchette was dead—
asphyxiated—and you would have said, to look at
her, by another stroke. After this the murderer,
with the thread of a cat passed into the corridor,
gained the postern and thence the street, all un-
seen. It was 20 minutes past 9,. By rapid walk-
ing Lapissote was in the Rue St, Denis as the

Justice secures and condemns a culprit—tiue or
false matters little. O-car Lapissote's crime,
therefore, was the perfection of art, for Justice
was not at fault a moment in discovering the mar-
derer. It was the coachman, of course. The
fragments of the burned letters proved it. Be-
sides, who e.se save the coachman could have
known the conditions so favourable to crime?
Who else have keys to the service stairway, the
kitchen door, the secretary itself ? Beginning by
robbing the widow in concert with the bonne,
was it not logical that he had cleared the step

between thief and assassin ?
Besides this, his antecedents were bad ; he was
unable to tell his whereabouts at the time of the
crime, and he protested too fervently. Every-
thing was against him. He was tried, condemned
an d guillotined, judges, jury, advocates, and
journals uniting in a harmonious chorus as to the
fitness of his end. There was but one obscure
point in the whole chain of evidence—what had
be done with the money the widow had certainly
possessed? “Hidden it,” said eveiyone, “after
killing her.” In short, if ever criminal was recog-

ment that increased hour by hour, and that senti-
“enb wa ? P r ! d ri the pride of an artist. That which
deadened him to all moral consideration was
precisely the perfection of his work, the know-
ledge that he has shown himself truly flawless ;
and in this, for a while at least, his thirst for
superiority found ample gratification. Still he re-
mained as before commonplace, obscure, and
nearly unknown, despite the fact that he had used
his ill-gotten fortune to fete the critics and force
the doors of the journals and reviews. The public
continued cold and [carping. “His essays were
h j B £T iticiBinB
marked with the brand of stupidity.” Even the
profession knew Anatole Deserole, the pseudonym
he was unng at the time, as a man of more means
than brains, and unanimously refused him an
atom of genuine talent. To convince him of his
stupidity, however, was impossible.
“It would be very different,” he said to him-
self, “if Icoild recount my chef d’aiu-rc. Anatol
Deserole is doubtless a fool, Oscar Lapissote was
not; ha was a genius, though his great achieve-
ment, powerfully conceived, executed, and success-
ful, is yet unheralded ! That day I had an in-
spiration, a true one; it is that which makes
things perfect. All the same, it would have been
better to have written it instead of executing it;
I should now be celebrated, for I should have
written what all the world would desire to read
a story, the only one of its kind—the story of a
finished crime -”
This nobion became at last a possession, that he
struggled against for ten years, allowing himself
to be by it more and moref at first

perversity (that forced the personages of Edgar
Poe to cry aloud their secrets), it was a mania for
literary renown, an inordinate craving for sensa
tional fame. Like a sublte counsellor who one
by one, pursues and conquers all objections' his
fixed idea pursued and conquered him with a
thousand reasonings.
“ Do it, Deserole,” it urged persistently ; “ycu
are safe behind the shield of justice. The' crime
is okl, the incidents forgotten, the culprit dead
and buried, his head between his legs It will
seem, your story, by an ancient judicial history
artistically arranged. You can put in it all the
thoughts and rancors that pushed you to commit
it, all the skill and ability used in its conception
and execution, all the circumstances furnished by
that marvellous inventor who styles himself
Chance, You alone are in the .secret of the work,
no one will know you have drawn it from reality
—they will see in it but the efforts of a wondrous
imagination—you will be a great writer, as you
have wished to be, revealing himself late, but by
a master stroke. You will enjoy your crime as
never criminal enjoyed it before. Recount it then

majestic horror. Cast aside your pseudonym that

name that has the air of a pseudonym. It is not
Antoine (»airland, Jacques de la Tour, or even
Anatole Deserole, that trio of unknowns, but you
yourself. Oscar Lapissote, who should be illus-
trious ! ”
One evening then, in consequence of this de-
cision, he seated himself before his desk, his brain
on fire, his baud burning, and wrote with a dash
tho history of his crime, his miserable debut and
struggle?, his Bohemian life, his multiplied
failures, his rancors, revolts, and idea of revenge
upon the actual for the sins of the chimera,
that had led him astray—in short, in this romance
of merciless psychology his soul was laid bare.
Drawn with sober stroke? but frightful clearness,
he depicted the meeting and the murder at the
Pitie> the scene in the Rue Saint Denis, the death
of the ‘ culprit,” the triumph of the true mur-
derer, the cause that had decided the author—
given with curious and satanic detail—to publish
his crime ; winding up. with an apotheosis of Oscar
Lapissote, and signing his. name Oscar Lapissote,
at the bottom of the confession.
“A. Finished Crime” app°ared first in the
Revue des —and scored, as a line or two from
the leading critiques of the day will show you, an
instant success, Gille, of La Dame Blanche, de-
Glaring that M, Deserole had at last given them
Ins true measure, and in abandoning petty jour-
nalism for the field of fiction his former failures
were amply atoned for. All of them to a man
lauded “ The Grime ” to the skies and agreed that
the skill of the writer had turned a vulgar assassi-
nation into an astonishing work of combination
and psychological dissection. Gaboriau sank into
insignificance !
Nevertheless, in all this torrent of popular
applause, two things disclosed themselves that
greatly irritated Oscar _ Laphsotte—first that
every one persisted in taking his true name for a
false one and continued to call him Anatole
Deserole ; second, that they talked too much of
imagination, and failed to bring forward with
sufficient prominence the probability and natural-
ness of bis recital. He was tormented by it to
the extent of making him forget his new-born
glory. Artists are always sensitive, and thus one
day as a friend was felicitating him upon the suc-
cess of his wonderful romance he responded coldly
that his congratulations would be more suitable
if he recognised that his work was not a romance,
but a fact, as recounted. “It was I, ’he added,-
carried away by arrogant pride, “ I who com-
mitted it! ”
“ Charming ! cried his hearer, “ charming ! ”
and the next day the papers were filled with the
whim of the great Anotole Deserole, who wished
to pass himself off for an assassin. Oscar Lapisotte
was furious ; in saying what he had he had done
he had been led into by irritation and pride ;
now, however, his prestige was slipping from
hi hi —his word questioned ; he renewed his con-
fession to all the friends he encountered on the
boulevards. At first they considered it droll,
next monotonous, at the end of the week the
behaviour of a fool. This was too much —his
prestige must be regained—he declared the facts
in the public cafes with the same result. “So be
it,” said he, “so be it —I have told you the truth
you refuse to see it—then I will prove it —all
Paris shall know 7 who Lapisotte is ! ”
True to word, the following morning he ap-
peared before the Juge d’lnstruction who, ten
years before, had conducted the affair of the Hue
St. Denis. “Monsieur,” said he, “I come to con-
stitute myself yoittr prisoner. lam Oscar Lapis-
sote !”
“It is useless to continue, M. Deserole, ’ cried
the judge. “Your book and the whim with
which you have amused us for a week past are
equally familiar to me. I congratulate you. An
author myself once, I appreciate the feeling that
induces yon to try the effect of pleasantry upon
me also. It gives me pleasure to know you. ”
“ But I tell you lam Lapissote. I committed
the crime. I can prove it.”
“ Good, monsieur, good ! lam amiable —I lend
myself to the play. But before you proceed to
prove it allow me to say a word. I have read
your book, as I told you, and I wish to point out
as a friend, of course-—that it has faults—grave
ones. In imagination it is rich, singularly so 5
well plotted, and well expressed; but you have
passed the boundaries permitted to the fancy of
writers. Certain of your circumstances sin against
probability ”
“ But I tell you ”
“ Allow me, allow me—l pain ycu, perhaps,
but surely you can see, though latitude must be
given in matters of crime, that yours is not
naturally combined. The meeting with the
bonne at the Pitie is too much a chance ; the
chloral—pardon the humour—hard to digest ;
other circumstances the same—your famous
crime, in short, impossible. As a writer, M.
Deserole, I admire you greatly ; as a criminal—”
“You shall admire me, too ! ’ and with a howl of
rage Lapisote precipitated himself upon his
critic, his eyes bloodshot, bis lips flecked with
foam. But for the timely arrival of assistance,
brought by the hubbub, a third victim would
have gone to keep the company of the other two.
Ten days later he was carried to the Charenton
as a full-fledged lunatic, the journals of the city
coming out with flaring headlines descriptive of
the sad event.
“Behold,” said they, “a man whom genius
crazed. A modern Pygmalion in love with his
own creation. _ Anatole Deserole allowed success
to turn his brain.” He was not crazy, however,
as we kno w too well, and his suffering was all the
more acute because of it.
“ I should not mind it,” he cried continually^
“ not even to be guillotined, if for a moment they
would recognise the truth, and give me a taste of
the glory that is justly mine; but they will not
in death even I shall pass for Deserole, I, Lapis-
sote, the man of nerve, decision, action !”
At last, by force of living in a fixed idea and in
the company of madmen, Lapissote’s brain was
truly turned, and just at the moment when he
ended by believing himself truly Deserole, and
that he had never assassinated any one, the
Faculty declared him cured.
Two weeks ago he died in Paris, convinced that
his crime was a fiction and that he had dreamed
instead of acting it.

The late Judge Meymott was doing the cir-

and were resolved on having some fun at the
Judge’s expense They accordingly chartered an
old woman (an ancient celebrity) for the purpose ;
her recompense to consist of a silk dress and a
dozen of champagne. According to instructions
she entered the breakfast-room just as they were
all assembled. “ A word wid yer anner, if ye
plaze.” “ Well, my good woman, what is it? ’
“Just come aside, sorr, it’s not for all ears.”
Drawing close to the legal dignitary, as though
intending to whisper fometbing, she imprinted a
smacking kiss on his cheek and bounced from the
room with a ghoulish “Ha! ha !ha ! Give won
me silk dress ! ”
A shooting case came on in a Queensland
court the other day, and the customary police-clod
“shwore” to certain cartridges which he found
on the prisoner. He hadn’t examined the caret
ridges, but he felt morally convinced they wer-
the right ones. When the lawyer asked how he
knew that the substance in the cartridges was
gunpowder at all, he replied, with the confidence
of an ancient martyr, “ Bekase it’s in the cart-
ridges.” Did he know the taste of gunpowder?
No,_he wasn’t aware it had any taste. Could he
distinguish gunpowder from coal ? Yis, av coorse
he could, and was prepared to do it any day.
Then the lawyer drew himself up several feet, and
prepared to crush this beaming witness with one
fell blow. “ Now, sir,” he said, with awful deter-
mination, “will you tell me how you would dis-
tinguish a quantity of powder from a ton of coal?”
“By the soize ov them, sorr.”

Says the S. F. Newsletter :
Perhaps the pettiest thing- a great Government ever
did was to allow the Australian colonies to pay the whole
expense of an American steam line for 18 years, whilst
the United States declined to refund the postage which
the line brought it. That was betraying a commercial
instinct with a vengeance. It would have resulted
differently if there had been a job in it out of which some
politician could have made money.
Guinness’s Brewery Co. has divided 15 per

In addition to the dividend, £49,000 was carried
forward, £30,000 transferred to the depreciation
fund, and £150,000 to the reserve fund. Apropos

pays a small percentage, should be nationalised, so
also should the quasi-monopolies which pay 10 to

What is described as a “ disgusting scene”
took place last week in the Queensland Legisla-
tive Assembly. “ While business was proceeding
a member came in so drunk that he was unable to
keep on his legs. He fell several times and had to
ba removed.” Well, anyhow, that’s much better
than being sober in your legs and drunk in your
head and standing up and talking by the yard and
having your speech solemnly reported in Han-
sard. When the M.P.s get drunk may they
get dead-drunk.! And so say all of us,
Duncan Gillies and his colleagues have
turned their backs for ever on the deposed Vic-
torian Speaker, Mr. Peter Lalor. A letter from
the old Eureka hero, complaining of the Electoral
Bill, as a measure to secure seats for eertain Go-
vernment supporters, to the exclusion of himself
and_ others, was read in the House last week.
Gillies openly expressed his official opinion that
said letter was “something scandalous,” and the
faithful crew behind him wagged their heads in
approbation. Eighteen months ago they ter-
rembled under sturdy Peter’s gaze.
The question of the right of any news-
paper representative to a seat in the reporters’
gallery of the Victorian Parliament has again
cropped up and has been left to the Speaker for
settlement. The sole right to the gallery was
claimed by the leading morning journals for some
years and was first challenged by Mr. Graham
Berry when he became the proprietor of a small
weekly print, the Colling wood Advertiser. The
wealthy newspapers beat the democrat then, but
he soon after sat as a leader upon the benches
below and ruled where once he had been refused
admission.
Dear Bulletin,— lie your par. on the dis"

as to the cause, which you attribute to the anti-
pathies of the old Provincial days and the jealousies
of Auckland and Otago. The fact is that the
day before the question of the subsidy was to be
discussed in the N, Z Parliament a Press telegram
was received from ’Frisco stating that Spreckels,
the contractor for the mail service, had decided to
ship back the white men sent from Sydney to man
his vessel and continue to employ Chinamen
despite the strong feeling against them in New
Zealand and Australia. That Press telegram cost
Mr, Spreckels several thousands of pounds, as
there is little doubt that but for its (to him) in-
opportune appearance the N.Z, Parliament would
have voted the subsidy, although probably at a
retrenched figure.—Yours, A.S.

Some very curious and interesting state-
ments have lately _ gained currency respecting
the testamentary dispositions of a very wealthy
deceased New South Wales colonist. The legiti-
mate members of the deceased’s family, it is
said, conceive the provisions of the will to be of
such an extraordinary nature as to do them much
injustice, fej keenly is this felt that active steps
are being taken to contest the will 5 and the
aggrieved persons, feeling their case to be of ex-
ceeding importance, involving, as it does perhaps
the largest amount of money which has ever locally
been the subject of any similar action, and to re-
quire the most skilful handling, have been engaged
for some weeks past endeavouring to obtain re-
gardless of expense, the services of the very be A
legal talent which the choice of not merely NSW
but of all Australia gives them.* With this
view it is reported on excellent authority that
strenuous efforts have been made to induce the
K.ight Hon. Mr. Dailey to accept the leading
brief, with the famous “ cross-examining
fiend of Melbourne, Mr. Purves, Q C., as
second; both gentlemen to be supported by the
ablest men available in the whole of the colonies,
ihe fee offered to Mr. Dailey as leader is said to
be by a long way the highest ever marked upon
a bnef in Ausbraha. But it is feared that the
state of the right honorable gentleman’s health
will not allow of his taking the part it is wished
that he should, and which, under other circum-
stances, it is understood he would have much
pleasure in doing. It is therefore probable, unless
some marvellous change should take place in Mr.
Dailey s health, and render it possible for him to
accept the brief offered, that the lead will fall to
Mr. Purves. It is reported that Mr. Dailey has
expressed the fullest confidence in that gentle-
man s power for such a position, and that he re-
gards him as one of the few able men available for
the conduct of the case.

The letters “ E.W.1.” are written on the
“ an y of the Sydney ladies by this time,
r j •’ „ stands for “Exhibition of Women’s
Industries, and for months past in the female
world everybody who has the slightest claim to be
anybody, socially speaking, has been organising
writing, committee-holding, persuading, touting,’
cadging, bullying, snubbing, quarrelling, and
generally raising Cain,” to bring to a successful
issue the huge bazaar now being held at the old
Exhibition Building, Prince Alfred Park. As
might have been anticipated, the control of the
affair having been left solely to women, the ar-
rangements are delightfully mixed up. The
catalogue is a hollow fraud ; nobody knows where
ar Dy llD S 8 ) nor what is going to happen, nor
what you have to pay to see it happen if it does.
A part of the huge hall is curtained off as a con-
cert and lecture-room, and energetic ladies occa-
smnally deliver addresses there to thin audiences
while the weary, bored, perspiring crowd in the
body of the building are in hopeless, apathetic
ignorance of the fact that anything whatever is
going on anywhere. Sometimes a singer lifts up
her squall for the edification of a chosen few, but
the bulk of the visitors hear nothing but faint
shrieks which wander ghostlike through the
building, and lead timid females to think
that a murder is being committed somewhere.
Dramatic performances are given nightly by some
more or less aggressive amateurs, and serve to add
another and deeper grief to hearts already bowed
down with the loss of Nellie Barren and Fred.
Leslie. It is a wonder those amateurs are allowed
to live. Heaven sends theatres and the devil
sends amateurs. The various exhibits in the show
have tickets on them, giving the following par-
ticulars Exhibition of Women’s Industries.
Section, blank; class, blank; delegate’s name,
blank; exhibitor’s name, blank; number of ex-
hibit, blank. For sale for the benefit of blank •
price, blank; other particulars, blank: every-
thing, blank. This is a useful design for a ticket
for agricultural shows. Suppose a show bossed
by stupid, blundering men were studded with ex-
hibits marked with tickets consisting entirely of
blanks, the management would be lynched. The
gallery is devoted to “fine arts,” and the first
thing one sees is a boudoir, or what poor Fred
Marshall used to call a “ boirdoo.” This boudoir
has obtained some_ unspecified prize for tasteful
arrangement. It is a great agony in yellow, un-
speakably bizarre in colour, tasteless in decoration
and stiff in arrangement; the formal-looking
furniture and artificial ornaments bear about as
much resemblance to a tastefully, decorated
boudoir as the trimmed and shapen box hedges of
a German garden do to the studied negligence and
easy beauty of a properly-arranged greenhouse,
bo far as the lady visitors are concerned there is
but one thing in the show—Lady Carington’s
dressing-case. A lot of gold vases, scent-bottles
trays, mirrors, &c, with the monogram in
diamonds on the top of each, make up this most
attractive exhibit. The women hang round and
gloat over it all day long. For a man there is
nothing whatever of attraction except the girls.
A wilderness of daubed pictures, badly-dec:rated
screens, plaques, fans, stools, table-covers, cups,
all covered with feeble unoriginal attempts at paint-
ing, make up the fine-artsection. Thenumberof ori-
ginal pictures is considerable, and nothing in the lot
would have been entitled to even a sky-high place
on the walls of the Art Society’s Exhibition. The
affair is drawing fairly well now owing to the
amount of “tone” imparted by a management
mainly consisting of Darling Point duchesses and
others of the now far-famed “Napkin Noblesse,”
but the general public stop carefully away, and
after a week or two, when the tone shall have
lost its savour, the affair will dwindle down to its
natural condition of an unattractive, unremunera-
tive parody on a big bazaar.

We read in a London paper an interesting
account of the career and adventures of our
vivacious, plucky, and good-hearted friend, Mr.
W. Pritchard Morgan, once of Cooktown, the
“ Welsh gold-king. Says our contemporary ;
Mr. Morgan is a keen sportsman, and a remarkably
fine shot. He and another man were considered the
two best shots in Australia, and it is related that some
friends arranged a contest between them to see which was
the better of the two. A small target, the size of a penny,
was chalked on a tree, the distance being 150 yards. The
other man shot first, and hit the ring in the middle, then
Morgan fired. The trunk was closely examined, but, to
the surprise of everyone, no trace of a second bullet could
be found. His rival then shot again, and hit the chalk
line. Mr. Morgan took his second shot, firing with great
Again no (race of his bullet! To all appearances,
he had twice failed even to hit the tree. Admitting him-
self defeated, he paid over the stakes. A few days after-
wards, however, someone, out of curiosity, dug the
bullets out of the wood, when he was astonished to find
lour altogether, one on the line and three right in the
fu n : r ?V all makiD £t h e same hole. This clearly showed
that Morgan had hit the centre twice to his opponent’s
once, but whether he received the double stake we have
not heard.
Strangely enough, we have never heard, either.
Continues the writer :
Mr. Morgan has bought thousands of acres of land in
Wales, together with beautiful Bentyrion, a castellated
residence overlooking the estuary of the Mynach The
lovely Italian terraces face the estuary, arid on a quiet
summer evening the view can only be described as mag-
nificent. Here the “gold King” lives in quiet enjoy-
ment of well-earned repose, entertaining a large circle of
friends with lavish hospitality, and enchanting his lady
gueati with his rich musical voice and capital per-
formances on the guitar as he rows them about his lake.
That’s him ! They’re writing about our Pritchard
Morgan and nobody else, we’ll take our affidavit.

ihe Revd. J. A, Sopar (he doesn’t spell
hrs name with an “a”) in his lecture on
Woman’s Bondage,” at Petersham, Sydney, the
obner Sunday, said : u Any woman married and
not appreciated by her husband was in bondage.”
He omitted to say what she was in when ap-
preciated by some other woman’s husband, who
might be in the temperance-lecture line, say, as
Mr. Yates, of Melbourne, was, but he scored well
with the neglected darlings when he continued :
Fancy living 10 or 20 years with a man, making
him nice things for dinner,” (angel-cakes, war-
ranted to kill at a thousand yards) “ stitching but-
tons on his shirts, darning his socks, nursing and
training his children, and ministering in a thou-
sand ways to his comfort, and yet never
getting a single kiss.” The fact is, how-
ever, that most married women are un-
appreciated simply because they do not do the
things Mr. Soper referred to. They are unappre-
ciated, and their kissing is boycotted because they
set before their hungry hubbies a chunk of burnt
meat that looks like a navvy’s fist with the thumb
and fingers cut off, jabbed into a morass of cold
fat and call it grilled rump-steak; because their
poor martyred husbands’ shirts are generally
fastened with lemonade-wire or a bent nail, and
because all the nursing and training of their
children is done by a goat, a dirty feeding-bottle,
and a slatternly slavey who hasn't brains enough
to enable her to raise a clutch of chickens pro-
perly. The good wives are appreciated and kissed
too, Brother Soper, but they are scarce —very
scarce and they seem inclined to grow scarcer.

I hat those responsible for the nomencla-
ture of the pictures in the N.S.W. National Gal-
lery are somewhat weak on the education ques-
tion is made manifest by the fact that they have
translated the title of a photogravure of one of
Be Neuville’s pictures, representing an attack on
a French gun by the Prussians, from “ A Piece in
Banger ”to “ A Piece of Danger.” A stranger
who was surprised at this evidence of the progress
of erudition in N.S.W,, turned his back on “ A
1 iece of Danger ” and sought a crumb of comfort
in gazing at “Rorke’s Drift,” A lady whose
costume and well-appointed victo-ia proclaimed
her a member of tl the first families," was descant-
iog on the masterpiece to some frie id and de-
scribed it as “ General Gordon at Khartoum.”
This is a melancholy “ piece of fact.”

The general reliability of police evidence
was well illustrated at Melbourne Criminal Court,
the other day, when a constable swore that—ac-
cording to his knowledge and belief—it was 400
yards from Lonsdale-street to Little Lonsdale-
street, and a mile from Scott’s Hotel to the Bank
of Australasia. “You are not a native, I pre-
said Mr. Purves, Q C., contemptuously.
Oh, yes, I am,” was the ready reply, whereat
the A.N.A. President looked sick, and Judge
Wrensfordsley smiled benignantly.

A gentleman calling himself “Non-
Churchman,” complains in the correspondence
column of the Sydney D.T. that marriage is too
expensive in N.S.W,, and points out that £5-the
fee charged by Church of England clergymen—is
often more than the girl is worth. To this a
melancholy incumbent replies, with bitterness :
There is a saving “ if " in “ Non-ohurchman’s ” letter of
Saturday last I hasten to catch him before he decides.
assure him that “ the general fee given ” is by no means
" That is to say, few of my acquaintances among
the clergy live where that happens much. Against
“Non-churchman’s” instance I quote one which is not
only actual but typical. The marriage ceremony is over
and the vestry almost cleared of muslin, tears, and things
The bridegroom says to the clergyman, “ What’s the
damage V The clergyman replies. “ There is no fee for
the solemnisation of marriage. 1 ’ It would sound odd to
say, “I leave it to you,” Bu 6, practically, it is left to him.
It is this style of leaving it to him which fills the
parson’s cup with sorrow, and the case certainly
calls for Government interference, and the estab-
lishment of a regular tariff. If the parson could
be licensed like a cab for hire at so much an hour,
with an additional charge if kept waiting, or else
be chartered at a fixed rate by the job, provision
being made for the imposition of a fine for furious
driving through the marriage service, and if affairs
could be so fixed that he could be run in for over-
loading if he was found trying to marry two
couples at once, things would probably go a good
deal more smoothly.

A Sydney barrister, who is as popular in
the drawing-rooms of Darling Point as in the
Supreme Court, and whose fondness for children
is one of the best known of his characteristics,
recently met with a queer adventure. He called
at a house where some of his little friends lived,
and asked the servant, “Are they upstairs in the
drawingroom?” On being told “Yes,” he said,
“All right, I’ll go up by myself.” The servant
thereupon left him in the hall. The man of law
then took up a rough sheepskin rug and put it
over his shoulders. On arriving at the drawing-
room door he went down on all fours, slowly
opened the door a little way and began to groan
and roar like a wild beast; then he advanced a
little way into the room making a hideous noise.
Unfortunately for him none of the children were
present, only two English visitors staying in the
house, who were scared out of their wits by this
extraordinary apparition. They screamed loudly
and rang the bell violently, thinking a madman
was coming, and it took a deal of explanation to
put matters to right.
Two old Sydney land-marks are going. A
house in Lower George-street, built by Isaac
Nichols—at one time Postmaster—in 1808, the
year Governor Bligh was deposed, is being pulled
down. So is the one ad joining, built and inhabited
in 1812 by a well-known colonist, Mrs. Margaret
Reibey.

A lovely legend is told of two N.S.W*
Civil servants who recently found themselves
pecuniarily m a tight place. The first man, whose

friend, Juggins, and having explained his troubles
said : If you would only oblige by putting your
a hill for £1 oO I can get the money from
old Isaac Moses at once. I have done business
with him before.” Juggins, fancying he saw a
way to get out of his own troubles, replied i
Certainly, old man, but on one condition. I’m
in a little temporary difficulty myself, but I’ll
back your paper if you agree to put your name to
a bill of mine for £2OO. It’s a mere matter of
form, and my friend, Moses Isaacs, will imme-
diately hand over the cash.” As both parties
h®ld high positions in the Service, the money was
advanced in cash instanter, but in a few days
after Muggins cleared off to a foreign land, and
the duped Juggins is now responsible for both
amounts.

of the ungodly manner in which it had been

ever saw the worse for drink and who yet must have

has now spent all his available funds on his huge

realised on the grant and bought some rich

tion. The college is located on bleak and barren
ground and is in that regard by no means a
pleasant location for students.

The desolate region of Cooper’s Creek has
blossomed like the rose. It has produced a hair-
less mare, and Lady Carington’s commendation
has fallen upon it There are only a few people
in that quarter of Queensland, anyway, but from
a Sydney standpoint it may be said that the an-
nouncement of Lady Carington’s pleasure at being
introduced to a hairless mare made some of them
wish that they too were hairless mares. If not,
refined society at Cooper’s Creek is uhlike refined
society at Potts Point. For instance, listen to
this monologue from the lips of our best girl, who
is only a woman, and therefore a Tory, after
all
“ One hundred and fifty Nonconformist
ministers and It! Quakers have signed a declara-
tion expressing their approval of the legalisation
of marriage with a deceased wife’s sister.”—Cable,
An Argus advt. “ Wona.—Fear not,
dearest; I will be careful now I know my life is
precious to you, for whom ’tis happiness to live.” —
O happy, happy, hairless mare,
For you good luck shone brightly,
You were not spent with anxious care,
You were not sleepless nightly.
You did not look out daily for
The postman with a letter,
Announcing you’d be welcome, or
Suggesting Would be better
If you would curb, a month or t wo,
Your wild anticipations—
O happy, hairless mare, you knew
Not one of these sensations !
’Tis these that score the brow with carp,
And mark the features over,
And turn away the soul from prayer,
The heart from friend and lover !
We know if she will take our hand
And draw us from the masses,
That we can travel round the land
Among the select classes.
And thus instead of wedding one
To whom hard toil is vital
We’d catch a man of wealth, or son
Of someone with a title !
O happy, happy, hairless mare
Pronounced at once a treasure !
While hope alternates with despair
As we await her pleasure !
Good Nonconformist ministers, and Quaker men
sixteen,
We’ll tell you in a simple way exactly what you
mean;
Each of you has gob a wife, and each of them, we
guess,
Is blessed with single sisters who are dreams of
loveliness.
Lil, Laura, Loo, Evangeline, and darling little
Grace
Are fond of paying visits to “ their married sister’s
place,”
And when, perchance, that “better half” don’t
happen to be by,
They sit upon their “ brother’s ” knee and re-
arrange his tie.
They rough his hair in merriment, and say he
“looks a sight ”
They pinch his arm, and tickle him with feminine
delight—
They call him “ wretch ” (and other names as ter-
rible as this),
Until he has to punish them by giving them a kiss.
And, now and then, the “brother” shakes his
dear, fraternal head,
And wonders which he’d marry if his Mary Ann
were dead—
Yea, whether he’s a sinner, or regarded as a saint,
He always wants the one that is to be the one she
aint.
For there’s nothing half so beautiful and wonder-
ful in life
As Anglo-Saxon fondness for the sisters of your
wife;
O! Nonconformist ministers, and Quaker men
sixteen,
We all are one in spirit, though the ocean rolls
between.
Dear Wona, take a handkerchief and wipe your
weeping eye,
For, now he knows you dote on him, he doesn’t
mean to die;
He’ll have a care, you may depend, and nothing
reckless do,
For O!it is such happiness to keep alive—for you.
Did he not think your woman’s heart was throb-
bing for his sake
We might be drinking whisky at your faithful
lover’s wake,
But since he came to understand the price you set
on him
He’ll never court a cruel death to gratify a whim.
He will not get into a train until it fairly stops,
Nor take a thousand other means to be a bleeding
“ copse”;
And if into the river cold he tumbles by mistake,
The chances are he’ll swim ashore for pretty
Wona’s sake.
He will not gaze adown a gun to see it going off ;
He’ll take a cup of gruel when he has a little
cough;
And into any vital part he will not stick a knife,
Or otherwise take measures to destroy his precious
life.
So, Wona, keep your pecker up, and wipe away
the tear,
That noble fellow’s message bids his darling never
fear;
He was a reckless divil once (we know not why or
how),
But—Heaven bless him for those words !—he’s
very careful now.

846 Macquarie street North, Sydney, Got. 17, 1888.
Mv dbar Moorabinda, —
It is rumoored that a giddy N.S.W. M.P. of many
summers has just re-married.
There has, I hear, been a grand flare-up at an Austra-
lian vice-regal residence in consequence of the little game
played by a dashing lady who has for some months been
palmed off upon local society as somebody’s wife. Which
she wasn’t.
I am told that a certain foolish young man managed to
part with most of his money during the Australian tour
of a certain leg-show. While the Company occupied a
ELECTRIC PHOTO-END. CO., 8 BRIDGE-ST. SYDNEY.
MR. PHIL. MAY.
certain metropolitan theatre he took a lease of a box at
£lB a week and spent £l6 a week in flowers for the
object of his adoration, whom one night he endowed with
£lOOO-worth of diamonds. And now he is not in a posi-
tion to give anybody £loofl-worth of diamonds. Her
troubles!
I am told that the Southern doctors marvel much at the
lack of details which are forthcoming as to the cause of
the sudden death of Sir Anthony Musgrave. They say
flatly that, failing a specific explanation of the symptoms
set down in the newspaper accounts of the late Governor’s
death, the cause of his disease must be set down as
poison. Poor Sir Anthony 1 He was very worried-look-
ing when in Sydney—so much so that he might well have
been called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance. A
sprightly Sydney young society matron was dar-
ing enough to actually pun upon his name when he
visited the South during the Centennial sorrows. “Sir
Anthony," she said crisply, “ your name becomes you so
well that I believe you must have chosen it! ” “ And why
does it become me?” enquired H.E. in his habitually re-
served manner. “Oh,” was the pert reply; “because
you certainly are the mus grave individual possible ! ”
This friendly sally was met very frigidly indeed by Her
Majesty’s Queensland representative.
For the enlightenment of Potts Point widows who stay
at home in their gilded boudoirs when the remains of
Smyth are being jolted to the bone yard, “because it’s
not ‘ etiquette ’to follow one’s husband to the—ugh 1—
grave, my dear,” I mention that Lady Musgrave was pre-
sent in the vestry of the church where they read the ser-
vice over the body of her husband, to whom she was
sincerely attached. She had quietly slipped away from
Government House to avoid the glare of the “ hydra-
headed ” public which always regards vice-regality as a
puppet-show no matter under what conditions.
In consequence of the death of Sir Anthony Musgrave,
Lord and Lady Carington postponed their second official
ball from the 10th to the 16th October. As the alteration
was only publicly announced on the day the .ball was to
have been, one or two guests—possibly belonging to that
large and fashionable section of Sydney society which
can’t read—turned up dutifully on the evening of the
10th in full war-paint, hut were politely requested to
make themselves scarce that night, and “look in” on
“ Chooseday " instead. Upon which they beat a con-
fused and hasty retreat, wishing that the heavens would
fall and hide them. But the heavens didn’t, and these
hapless individuals are still making the air sizzle with
their blushes.
I went to see Carrie Swain bathe in a tank inVbe pre-
sence of a crowded house, at Sydney Royal the other
night. The fat woman had a front seat and wore black
with a large red feather fan. A nice toilette was of helio
tropa satin embroidered in silver; bub the prettiest get-
Up possible was “ sported ”by a fair young girl. It was a
white silk out square and nob too low and carelessly
trimmed with eofo white lace. At one si le of the square-
out corsage a large cluster of primroses and maidenhair
fern was artistic ally placed, and round the throat was a
tingle string of pearls. As for the dressing of Carrie herself,
she hasn’t much opportunity until the last act, when she
appears in a black velvet po’.onaise over a skirt of moire,
black velvet hat with mauve and black plumes. Every-
where else she is “ disability,” as Mrs. Jarvis would say—
but what does that matter ? She is the bright particular
star of a not very bright and particular play, evert if she
acts witli a horse-rug on.
Miss Swain, by the way, received a present from the
working staff of the Melbourne Theatre Royal, the other
day. It oons’sts of a silver scent-flask, which being
opened, reveals a miniature representation of the tank
scene in the “ Tomboy.” Accompanying the gift was a
letter complimenting Miss Swain upon being “the first
theatrical artiste who introduced the real water-tank
scene ” upon the Australian stage. Now, George, a penny
for your thoughts ?
Mrs. Malaprop is understood to adore the city, because
as she said recently. “ you see so many differed phrases
of life in it ”
Tickets for the banquet tendered to Frederick Cowan
by the musical community of Sydney cost 31s. (id. each.
Which was rough on many local disciples of Euterpe who,
though they would lain have sat at the feet of the com-
poser of “Ruth," yet could not spare the necessary
shekels. For the followers of music like the followers of
art, don’t exactly swim in coin in the land of the Golden
Fleece.
Clement Scott, the celebrated London theatrical critic,
says: “If ladies in the audience would dress with more
propriety those on the stage would soon follow suit.”
Competition kills decency.
Here is a beautifully lucid advt. from the S. M.
Herald:—
"M'OTICE.—To Exhibitors for Paris Exhibition.—
Will take charge of exhibits for N.S.W. and Vic-
toria. Speaking both languages.
Actually speaks the N.S.W. and Victorian tongues 1
Only fancy !
A correspondent tells me that in a back-blocks town-
ship there resides a polished specimen of cornstalk who
is considered by his circle to be the Chesterfield of the
district, for, whenever he attends a bush ball he never
roughly invites the lady to “ git up ” after the manner of
the wilds, but says elegantly, “ May I indulge ?” This
formula appears to me to require a lot of beating.
A correspondent requests me to state that the Mercan-
tile Social Club ball and the Bachelors’ ball, held at
Young (N.S.W.) on recent dates, were both simply “ har-
monious wholes.”
The very latest pastime amongst the English aristocracy
is wheelbarrow races. Each barrow contains a lady, and
is worked by a gentleman, and, as the barrow is decidedly
erratic in its instincts, the fair riders are often spread out
very promiscuously on mother earth. But all this is
“ fun, dontyerknow,” and the girls don’t mind it a bit !
Wheelbarrow races ought to be popular. Just think of
the golden opportunities they offer for a free display of
pretty hose and well-rounded ankles when the barrow
“goes over”—as it invariably does !
The Rosahill October meeting takes place on the 20th,
not on the 28th inst, as I stated last week.
I read that the death of the German Emperor will cost
the London theatres a million sterling as a nation in
“ complimentary weeds ” doesn’t go to the play.
Apropos, a good story is afloat in Lond on anent the
Morell Mackenzies. A few days after the death of the
Emperor, Lady Mackenzie had an “ at home,” to which
friends rallied dubiously, half expectin»it would be post-
ered. Upon arrival, however, teey found it to be in
progress, and, upon somebody remarking on this expec-
tation to Lady Mackenzie, she instantly replied: “Why
should it be postponed ? He wasn’t a relation of ours,
you know.”
Our Mrs. Mala prop doesn’t like cruel scandal. Her
coterie were maligning somebody recently and hinting at
very weir! doings in certain quarters, when Mrs. M.
broke in with, “Now, step, pray do. It makes me ill to
hear such importations made against anybody 1”
Apropos of the now far-away and possibly sea-sick
Gaiety Company, a correspondent in a post-mortem frame
of a letter pensively asks “ Why Letty Lind's skirts ait so
beautifully ?” Miss Letty’s garments used to cling like
that because they were divided, after the fashion vainly
advocated by the celebrated Lady Harberton, who
couldn't get a fooling in sassiely for her invention.
I used to repel the idea of split petticoats, but when I re
member the perfect fall of Letty Lind's skirts I don’t
think Id be very difficult to convert to them. And;
speaking cf the Burlesquers, Fred. Monte Christo Leslie
confided to me that he was an amateur actor once in “ the
dear days long ago.” Wasn’t it quite an odd thing that he
should have grown up under the circumstances ?
Sir Henry Loch, accompanied by Miss Deverell, Lieu-
tenant Ogilvy, A D O. (for the benefit of the educated blit
careless I submit that this name is pronounced “ Ovy
and Mr. F. S. Cowan arrived in Sydney on the 10th inst,
for the purpose of vie i ting the Fish River and Jenolan
Oaves. The vice-regal squad went almost directly to the
caves, staying but a few hours at Government House, and
arriving at their hollowed-out excelsior at noon next dily.
Wilson, cf the Cave House, had lavishly decorated his
premises in honour of the gubernatorial visit, and “ Wel-
come to His Excellency ” became almost obtrusive. The
vice-regal party admired duly the marvels of the caves)
and were also duly bruised on the head by stalactites and
prodded in the calves by stalagmites during their stay in
them. Friday night was spent at the Carington Hotel,
“on the mountings,” the party returning next day to
(hat othtr “Carington Hotel,” Inner Domain, until the
loth, when they wafted back to the “wickedest city in
the colonies,” per express.
At the last Skating Carnival at the Crystal Palace Rink
one y'oung lady—who wore a white satin dress and appro-
priate trimmings, which had been put through one of Tun
Bulletin presses— assumed the character cf “The Bul-
letin,” and looked charming.
Sydney, socially, just now is very limp, and, were it
not for the theatres, many a pale dude would literally
yield up the ghost. There was a grand opening meeting
on the Moorefleld race course, at Kogarah, on the 13th
inst. Canterbury Park races happened on the 15!h,
There have been one or two flower-shows, and the
Women's Industrial Exhibition, like the poor, of course,
we have always with us. But what are all these save a
weariness to the flesh ? As for fixtures in front—the out-
look in Sydney is “ far, far from gay.” The Horticultural
Society of N.S.W. hold their rose-show in the Inner
Domain (“by kind permission of his Excellency”) on
Nov. 8 and 9. On 3rd Nov. the Naval and Military sports
pursue their mad career at the Association Ground in the
presence of Lord Carington and three brass bands ; and
early in November the Southern Amateur Theatrical
Society give their inaugural performance of the dual bill
—“Boots at the Swan” ocmedietta and “The Crimson
Scarf ” operetta.
At an ambulance lecture and demonstration given at
the W.I.E. the other afternoon, the leoturess said : “ All
those who take an interest in ambulance work hoped at
the time that the many meetings then held would be fol-
lowed by the opening of numerous branches in the city,
the suburbs and the country. Unfortunately, this has
not been the case. The Sunbeam left us, carrying with
it, lam afraid, most of the enthusiasm for the cause.”
Of course 1 A certain class of Australian female would
go rag-picking if a “ distinguished person ” came out
with a rake and a fad that way for the purpose of getting
a nod from the distinguished head, or a dab of the distin-
guished paw—but she wouldn't like the pastime all the
same. The women who tore round with lint, binding up
dummies’ wooden legs and left their own babies to take
headers into the fire while they banged their umbrellas
on the floor at ambulance-meetings, are now heard and
seen no mere, andhnly a handful of genuine enthusiasts
remain to give demonstrations on sticking-plaster before
a crowd that ought to be ashamed of itself, as I am sure it
must always contain dozens of backsliders from Brassey.
Lady Musgrave purposes returning to England by the
Jumna leaving Brisbane on 30th October.
Sydney sassiety looks with cold disfavour on the new
flagship Orlando because she is absolutely too warlike.
Actually there is no deck-space for dancing, and the
poor Admiral has almost to climb over a cannon to get to
his cabin ! No space for “darncing” (as the itinerant
midsbipmite always pronounces it) is quite awful enough
to contemplate, isn’t it ? But when it comes to a real
live admiral having to get over a gun to go to bed—oh,
horrible!
Somebody asked Mrs. Malaprop to what country a com-
mon friend belonged by birth! “Heis of Scottish con-
struction,” replied our own, elegantly.
I received a letter the other day from a lover—not my
own, of course, but another’s Romeo—who calmly and
despairingly stated “I am engaged to a young lady
who is cursed with a black moustache, which she is com-
pelled to shave so frequently that her upper lip has
assumed a bluish tinge.” Then he asked for a remedy.
The best and only depilatory is to pull each separate hair
out ( any lover will operate with the tweezers), but never
shave, as each hair then becomes a hundred. However
I don't suppose they’ll mind that—some young men
would tweak blue bristles off Popsie's upper lip for
ever, and then collect them in a soft paper bag and work
’em up into a watch-guard—now, wouldn’t they ? For to
the lover
Stray hairs on his coat are but sources of bliss
And of joy that is utterly utter,
But when he is married it soon comes to this:
“ Here’s some more of your hair in the butter ! ”
A London journal says: “It cannot be alleged that
strenuous efforts are made in this country to counterfeit
virtue. There are English women whose apparent
anxiety it is to counterfeit vice. No doubt it is un-
pleasant that immodest women should effect the dress of
their modest sisters ” (modest only, if in sassiety, when
O utof evening dre?s anyhow), “but it is far worse that
tie latter should think that by copying the style of the
dtmi-mondaines they can mo.st effectually render them-
selves attractive to men.” After all, it appears to be a
case of “diamond out diamond.” Society steals Aspasia’s
robe and puts it on, with her manners. Aspasia makes
like reprisals, and things appear to me to be about even
Society and Aspasia generally manage to get even, don't
they ?
If Lady Carington keeps a “ diry ” I believe her entries
for last week would read ( a la Mark Twain): “Arose
went to the Women’s Industrial Exhibition,’’ right down
from Monday to Saturday, for both Lord and Lady Caring-
ton have been there almost every afternoon. They have
sat out concerts, and eaten Exhibition dinners, and
listened to lectures on everything, from Kindergarten up
to coal, with a devotion to duty that may well make
everybody blush. However, there’s a good time close in
front, for the Melbourne Cup week commences on the 3rd
prox. with the Derby ; the Cup is to be run on the 6tb
Oaks day the Bth, and Steeplechase day on the 10th of
November ! As I gloat over this festive programme I can
effuse no more, but only in a subdued kind of antieipative
rap’ure fubmri’ e myself

THE HAPSBURG DOUBLE IRON-FRAMED
PIANOS
Possess the following advantages :
Ist. The WIRES are of a very high quality, and
intensely sensitive; their vibrations, reverbe-
rated by a sounding board of special construc-
tion, are clear and bell-like, instead of the
muffled, or tinkettly, or metallic sounds so
common in cheap English or French pianos.
2nd. The action is perfect check repeater.
3rd. All the Hapsburg Pianos are Trichord.
4th, They are all Seven Octaves.
6th. They have consolidated Iron Frames of great
strength, thus resisting the rapid mutations of
a humid tropical climate, and requiring tuning
only at long intervals.
Bth. The Felts are Clinched on the Hammers, in-
stead of being fastened by glue, as is the case
with nearly every piano except the Hapsburg,
7th. They have Brass or Nickel-faced Rest Planks,
instead of the old-fashioned perishable style.
Bth Rust is guarded against, wherever possible,
by the substitution of bronze for other metals.
The outer cases are handsome in design, and
of durable and beautiful woods; they can be
had in Walnut, or in Walnut and Gold, or in
Ebony and Gold.

to the illustration. The vertical tub is very care-
fully made, with fluted sides. It is stationary, only
the water and clothes being agitated by an accu-
rately shaped dolly, which is worked by a fly-wheel.
The clothes are simply dropped in, no arrangement
or packing being wanted. The special reversing
gear moves this dolly swiftly backwards and for-
wards, and a very small expenditure of strength
suffices to lash the water into a mass of foaming
suds. In the process the clothes are floated to and
fro, up and down; currents and cross-currents of
water are formed which meet and are forced through
and through the fabric, carrying away every particle
of dirt and stain. The linen being merely SUS-
PENDED in the water, is not rubbed and scrubbed
as in hand-washing. Neither has anything to
submit to the hand-wringing process which in-
sensibly rips, tears and wears the clothes. Thus,
the most delicate fabrics cannot be torn by our
system of washing. Everyone has noticed that
their clothes seem to be as much worn by washing
as by use. This is caused by the fierce rubbing
they get upon washing-boards, or by the hands.
With the Beale Patent Washing Machines this
friction is done away with. Therefore, the clothes
will last far longer than by hand-washing, however
oareful. When the washing is done, the tub should
be wiped out, so that it be always sweet and clean.
There is no false bottom, and nothing to accumu-
late greasy sediments.

Tiio death, in the R d Sea, of Proftsstr
Henry Martin Andrew, of Melbourne Univer-
sity, wi 1 come as a shock only to those who knew
the deceased gentleman years ago, and were not
aware of the weakness of his physical condition in
his latter days. Broken and dispirited, with an
evidently weakening brain, there is no knowing
what might have ha; p med had he lived to suffer
much longer as he did.
L : thg > v Farrell declares that 35 years
ago Lord Salisbury, then plain Robert Cecil, and
Sir John Millais were trying their luck on separate
claims on the Bendigo rush, while Woolner, the
great s culptor, was hanging out in Melbourne, and
Henry George was humping bluey among the
goldfields. Tne Cabbage Garden was then “ en-
tertaining angels unawares. ” T) dav. Salisbury
runs the British nation, Millais and Woolner are
at the top of their respective trees, and Henry
George, like a second Messiah, has shed the light
of a s ipreme revelation upon the world.
Editor Bulletin.— Sir, —Allow mo to
corn ct an error app laring in your last issue You
state that “ the Opposition are endeavouring to
gab Sir Thomas M‘llwraith to pvss an extrem ly
drastic Inebriate Act,” aid you further refer to
S r S W. Griffith in connection with the meisare.
The fact is that the proposal is the outcome of my
experience as h f n. sec. of the Queensland Dis-
charged Prisoners’ Aid Society. At the annual
meeting held September 14, I moved that steps be
taken to establish an Inebriate Home, Gentle-
men of various shades of political and religious
opinion are acting with me in the matter, and as
power to compel patients to remain in the home
until fib for discharge is a sine qua non, we waited
on the Premier to urge the introduction of an
Inebrate Act, which he, fully realising its import-
an re, has promised to do next session. lam sure
you will be glad to learn that the motive is higher
and nobler than any Opposition desire to hamper
the Government.—Yours, &c., E. Parr Smith.
All the dear old familiar names —all the
names of the Sydney land-resumption heroes,
company bosses, and professional directors, are
on the share-lists of the colossal syndicates formed
to collar half-century leases of the N.S.W. Go-
vernment tramways and trade them off in London
at a few millions advance on cost price. One syn-
dicate has calmly reserved 100,000 shares for
such members of Parliament as choose to apply
for same—here we cough faintly—after the bill
has been engineered through the Legislature.
The public cannot expect the Sydney daily
papers to show up this iniquitous scheme to dis-
pose of a great State asset, practically without
competition, just at the moment when the new rail-
way commissioner—who, if let alone, might easily
place the property on a paying basis —is about to
enter on his duties. The Bulletin cautions the
N.S.W. public to keep its eye open, and to resist to
the uttermost the introduction of the thin end of
a wedge which, when fully driven home by the
sledge-hammer of corruption, will divorce the
people from the control of their own streets and
railroads.

The PRESTON PARK ESTATE
S^InTIDIC-^.T’E.
TO BE INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES’ STATUTE, 1864.
£69,000, in 25 Shares £2760 each,
Payable as follows:—£36o per fhare on Application, and the balance in equal Bills of One,
Two and Three Years, bearing Interest at rate of 6 per cent, per annum.
This Syndicate is being formed for the purpose of purchasing and subdividing 265 Acres of Land situate at corner of the main
High-street and another main road. This property has an extensive main road frontage of about one and a-half miles, is within 200
cr 300 yard< of the Railway Stati n and is in the centre of the c >micg Township and immediately o posite the Recreation Ground,
State School, Post Office, Public Hall, Church, etc.
The position of the land is simply p-rfection, being in the best part of this lovely district and of a charmingly undulating
character. It is land that must undoubtedly be largely sought for m sub-divisioo. The views to be obtained from this property
cannot be surpassed.
The sub-division may be proceeded with almost immediately. There will be an imme se main road frontage, and the estimated
profit to tha Syndicate is about 100 per cent, on the nominal capital.
The Venders have agreed to sell the property hr £69,000, which is about £260 per acre, the terms to be £360 cash each
share deposit, a~d the balance by promissory notes at one, two and three years, bearing interest at rate of 6 per cent, per annum, with
option to pay cash at any time with full rebate of interest.
A copy of the agreement under which this property has been acquired can be seen at the offices of the Solicitors, Messrs.
Tuthill, Geoghegan and Perry, 19 Queen-street, Melbourne.
It is anticipated that only the first instalment of the purchase money will be required.
In submitting this land the Vendors have the fullest confidence in its progressive character. Land all around this favourite
locality is being rapidly taken up. The “ Preston Park Estate Syndicate *' will rank second to nme in the district for pop larity, its
convenience to the new Railway Station, which is a settled fact, making it of such easy access, and the position of the land marking it
out as one of the most beautiful spots near Melbourne.

No previous Caulfield Cup has been the
medium for such market finesse and “cleverness” as
next Saturday’s race, A week ago, or evenlater, there
were not half a dozen horses, out of the 77 entries,
that could be reckoned upon as certain starters,
so carefully were owners hiding their hands.
Touts and ‘ 1 timers ” were never more barren of
ideas about the big event, for the reason that most
of the supposed “good things ” have been moving
in a mysterious way far from the madding crowd
at F.emington and Caulfield. But by the time
this appears things are likely to be tolerably well
straightened out for the wretched punter, who has
been lured into backing fewer “ stiff’uns ” than
usual, and will probably succeed in picking the
absolute winner in 10 tries. Of Victorian horses,
The Charmer is a likely one, and Mick O Brien’s
mount is likewise good enough to carry the public
shirt.
At last meeting of the Sydney Hant Club
on Rosehill Course, only one horse—Happy Jack
—got round in the steeplechase. Rather a poor
display for an alleged Hunt Club.
• •
Mr. Tom Haydon, secretary of the Vic-
torian Club, has been interviewed touching racing
mat'ers in England, and one of his remarks
fairly indicates the absurdity of accepting hastily-
formed opinions as hard facts. Mr. Haydon says
that none of the London sporting resorts can
come up to the Victorian Club in Melbourne, and
then goes on to speak of the Albert being the
“ principal club.” Now, if the interviewer had
gone to any one of 10,000 new-chums in Melbourne
he could have learned that the Victoria in Wel-
lington-street, Strand, is the principal book-
makers’club. The Albert plays a very second
fiddle to it. Again, Mr. Clibborn speaks of San-
down Park as a place where “ coming from the
train high and low jostle each other in a half-mile
walk across a narrow pathway. ” As a matter of
fact, the “ high”—or members of the club —have '
special trains, special railway platform, and pri-
vate pathway to the grand-stand.

Several Sydney papers seem anxious to
act as stakeholders in pugilistic and other
sporting matches. The English papers never
care for such an invidious task, and in Eng-
land no decent daily newspaper ever ostentatiously
announces that it has allowed two common
bruisers to meet at its office and fix up a punching-
match or prize-fight to which one of its staff has
appended his name as a witness.
*
Fancy a three-year old colt by a full
brother to Goldsbrough, out of a very fashionably
bred mare, only fetching (at Melbourne’s sale the
other dav) 20^ guineas—why, it isn’t the price of a
hack j The sire’s (Gloucester’s) fee would be ab mb
| 10 guineas, and then there is the expense of feed-
ing the colt for three years, breaking him in, &c ,
&c. One would be inclined to say that ho se-
breeding was a mighty poor game to go in for,
but it must be remembered that the price of a
crack three-year-old, say, Melos, would be a
couple of thousand pounds, and it costs no more
to breed a good one than a bad one. It is much
like a lottery, and where there are such big prizes
to be gained there must be a good many blanks.
Sydney is ab ut the cheapest place in Australia
to buy horses in ; resident in the bush can never
understand how it is that when they tend a real
good hack down to Sydney for sale they never get
anything like a good price, but when they ask
the fellows about town what they give for
their hacks they find that they part tre-
mendous figures. The explanation is that the
average Sydneyite does not know enough bo go
and buy his animal at a sale, and is too knowing,
as he think*, to luy him from a friend, so that
the horses which come to town for auction are all
sold bo the d( alers, who keep thorn awhile, get
them quiet to the trams, and sell them for double
what they gave. Only the other day a breeder
sent down a mob, among t them a nice hack, and
was astonished to find thad the good hack only
brought £1 *. A few weeks after he met a friend
of his riding this very horse, which he bad
“ picked up a regular bargain ’ at 35 guineas.
The dealer had got all the profit out of the horse,
and the owner had got nothing. This is always
the way with good quality horses, and if our bush
readers wani a wrinkle about selling their horses,
let them listen to the following :—The buyers in
Sydney are dividtd into classes. Those looking
for good quality hor-'es will only buy from the
dealers, who get their horses up into show condi-
tion and are on hand to stoke the buyer up with
the requisite amount of lies, and to show the
horses off properly. Middle-class horses, such as
spring-car 1 ), cab, and van sorts, v.ill only sell well
when quiet and fat If a cabman gof s into a yard
and sees a horse play up at all he won’t buy him—
he lets the dealers buy him at a low price and
they drive him round and show that he is quiet,
and get a good price for him afterwards. The
same remarks apply to poor conditioned horses.
The dealers take them and fatten them up, and
make all the money out of them. The only way
to get a good sale in Sydney is to send down any
sort of cheap “crocks,” so long as they are quiet
and fat. The men who intend to use them will
then bid for them, and will give the same figures
which they would otherwise give the dealers ;
and, as they don’t know much about horses, a
hopeless, broken-down, 15 year-old nag, which has
been worked right out and then given a spell an
fattened for sale, will often bring just as much
and more than a real good, sound-legged
youngster, so long as he is in good condition and
is quiet to knock about with. Therefore, let the
bushmen send down the cast-offs and they will
make a lot more money than by sending good
ones. We won’t charge anything for the advice.
The chapter of accidents which occurred
to Searle in his recent race recalls the wager-boat
race at one of the regattas, on a frightfully stormy
day, when Messenger won after everyone in the
race had been swamped, by paddling in sitting
astride of his capsized craft, and using his sliding
seat to paddle with. Talking of rowing, the
eight-oar crew to represent N.S. Wales are start-
ing work. It seems that there is some hitch about
getting the best men of the Sydney Kowing Club,
b cau e they are not pleased with the choice of a
coach. When a man is asked to row for his
colony he ought to be superior to such considera-
tion and it will be a good job if none of the pot-
hunting crowd referred to are ever asked or
wanted to row again.
A French horse, Tenebteuse, is cabled as
the winner of the Cresarewitch Stakes The lively
Gauls are proverbially danserousfor thi- race, and
for the Cambridgeshire, although of late years the
English handicappers (Mees's. Weatherby) in-
variably allot a respectable weight to anything
trained on the other side of the Channel.
•
As the ti ne for the groat Melbourne race-
meeting draws close the umal flavour of “ turf ”
pervades the atmosphere. Men who h *ve only
seen a race or ce in their lives discourse learnedly
about the chances of the Peer and Atercorn, and
tell othtr men equally intocent and ignorant
dark stable secrets and manreavres which the
owners and trainers never knew or thought of.
The knowing men who rr * supposed to be '* in ”
with the stables and to have valuable infomntion
get more and more important and retic c nb as time
goes on ; they always have some lorsn “going
for’’them in the Cup to v.in about £lO 000, ac
cording to their own story and, by the wav, it is
a surprising fact that the more *' informal ion ” a
man has the less cash he seems to be possessed of.
The ultra-knowing ones are always hard up. It
is the same with the horse owners—the men who
win when they can always do better than those
who go in for the waiting game, because
these latter, when they at last do send
their horse, generally run up against some
other “ waitisb,” who aho has been biding
his time and losing races to make a cer-
tainty when he is wanted. It often happens when
two herses meet in a race for which both have
been waiting, that they will race tight clean away
from the rest of the field, and thereby show the
handicapper what they can do. The winner, of
course, scoops the pool, but the second horse gets
a steadier next time he is handicapped, and wins
nothing by it Talking of information—if you ask
an old, experienced racing man, who has made a
study of performances, gallops, &c., what is going
to win the Melbourne Cup, he will tell you that it
is a very open race, and that no one can make a
very accuiate guess, but if you ask a barber’s ap-
prentice, he can always tell you the winner for a
dead certainty. A little cheek goes a long way
sometimes.

The Sydney University eight-oar crew that
went to Melbourne to row appear to have had a
“ sick ” time of it. When they arrived, the local
’Varsity scullers rolled up in force —to the number
of two, or thereabouts—and it is whispered tha
the Sydney men had to propose an adjournment
to a pub before their hospitable enteitainers made
any suggestions about irrigating their systems.
The secretary of the Melbourne crowd did not
appear on the scene till after the race was rowed,
and the dinner which was given to the Sydney
crew was a perfect Barmecidal feast —most of
those pres=nt got nothing to eat, as grub ran
short. Of course, as the Sydney men got beaten,
it may possibly be that there is a little of the
“ whipped dog ” business about their remarks.

A mania for going into sweeps has settled
on the community which is sending every pound
it can beg, borrow, or steal, for a chance in these
gigantic lotteries. The history of past sweeps is
somewhat instructive. Ore was annexed by a
policeman It is said that the owner of the
horse which the policeman had drawn, got to
k:ow the name cf the bobby and sent him word
to say that unless he would lay him a thousand to
nothing the horse would be scratched, as he
couldn't) afford to train horses for mere fun. The
astute policeman did not say that he would not
make the desired wager, and the horse won; then
thsowner went round for his cool thousand, and the
policeman with an airy, graceful smile absolutely
declined to pay him a farthing. Of course the
horse-proprietor had no remedy at law. The
policeman was on duty outside Tattersall’s when
the news came and he fainted into a crumpled
blue heap in the gutter immediately on hearing
that he had won. Another man went into a
sweep and drew a horse, and as he was a soft,
unsophisticated chap two dear friends advised
him to lay the owner £lOOO to nothing, and they
even Undertook the arduous duty of arranging the
bet with the owner, and fur this they got the
simple fello w to lay them each £5OO to nothing,
and wben he won the sweep and paid them
honorably they asked him whether he didn’t thank
he ought fo stand them another hundred or so
ai icce. How was that for h’gh ?
The Melbourne Racing Carnival —dear old
term ! —made a large commencement at Caulfield
on Saturday. Backers fell heavily at the first
fence, for the vastly-improved Mentor, little
fancied by his stable, beat a splendid field of
horses at weignt-forage, and established himself a
favourite for the Melbourne Cup straightaway.
That flying filly, Montalto, won the Great Foal
Stakes as easy as falling off a log, and Volley,
who palpably desired to turn it up, just beat
Wycombe for the Guineas. Volley’s performance
was nob calculated to strengthen shaken faith in
her Derby chance, although it added another leaf
to the laurel crown of Thomas Hales, Esq. A
Hunter’s Cup was chit fly remarkable for the
fact that Mr. Inglis was hissed for his riding
of Daphne, but Mr, Inglis is so often hissed
on such shadowy grounds that he probably
doesn’t mind woith mentioning. Mr. Sampson

THE CAULFIELD CUP.
If you ask for a tip
(A regular “snip,”
A “moral,” a “griffin,” a “cert.”)
Wherecn you may plank
Every cent in the bank,
As well as your boots and your shirt,
There is one in the race
Who is good for a “ place ”
(A “ shop ” is a term that’s allowed),
The Charmer’s the mare
Very sure to be there —
Unless she walks in with the crowd.
A LONG SHOT.
A tip for the Cup : When the numbers go up
And the cheering is loud on the flat;
When Ensign is beat, and the Peer owns defeat,
The winner is Aristocrat.

Read the following Testimonial, one of thousands more:
[COPY.]
Glenhope, 19th July 1886
To H. E Kugelmann, Esq., Professor of Natural
Science, &c.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Frank E. E. Knight,
of Glenhope, was taken ill with a severe cough about July,
1883, but, thinking it was only a severe cold, I did not
take any notice of it for about six months, when I com-
menced to expectorate blood and matter very freely. I
then thought it was time to consult a medical man, and I
went into Heathcote, and was treated for four months, but
without receiving any benefit. I then consulted a doctor
in Kyneton of considerable repute for six months, and,
although I failed to obtain the slightest relief, he told me
that I was all right, only requiring warm weather to com-
plete the cure, which statement I did not believe, and
accordingly consulted another doctor in Kyneton, and
informed him of the statement of mv previous medical
attendant, when he informed me that 1 was in a most un-
healthy state, and prescribed for me, and after treating me
for five months, he honestly informed me that my case was
incurable, and that it was useless to attend him any longer,
and he advised me not to take any more chemists’ medi-
cines, as all I had taken for the last 15 months was poison.
I then pressed him for a true statement of my case, and he
very reluctantly informed me that I was suffering from
Ulcerated Lungs or Consumption, and that I was quite in-
curable. During the time I was attended by the above
doctors, I was not able to lie down in my bed, and ex-
pectorated many quarts of blood and matter from my
lungs, and I lost weight rapidly. About this time I saw
your advertisement and decided to consult you, which I
did in March, 1885, when you greatly astonished me by
informing me minutely of the exact nature of my com-
plaint without my giving you any information, and even
without your having sounded or examined me. But my
astonishment was greatly increased when you told me that
you could guarantee to cure me upon a definite agreement,
which I gladly availed myself of. After having taken your
medicines for a month I was considerably worse ; expec-
torating very much, and throwing up several pieces of
skin from my lungs about the size of the palm of my hand;
but after this crisis I commenced to improve very fast.
After three months’treatment the expectoration and cough
entirely left me, and I had gained over two stone in weight,
a result which my friends considered little short of mira-
culous, as all expected I would soon die ; and from that
time (thanks to your most wonderful skill and ability) I
have not felt any return of my complaint, and my lungs
are as strong as ever they were, and I can do as good and
as hard a day’s work as I ever did. lam sure that people
diseased and suffering should avail themselves of your
treatment, and not delay as I did until I was given up to
die.—l remain, ever thankfully yours FRANK E. E.

A LEAP FROM “THE BULLETIN” PRIMER
The Prince of Wales has contributed 50
guireas to the building fund of the R.C. Church
at Lynn, England.
A wrinkle for parsons’ wives. A Mel-
bourne congregation has assured its minister’s
life for a cool thousand.
Da Witt Talmage Is quoted as sajing :
“ Men in our days speak of Heaven with a
shout, and of hell in a whisper.”
David Buchanan says the Salvation Army
approaches nearest to the religion as established
by Peter and the other Apostles.
Dr. Moore, R.C. Bishop of Ballarat, is
bringing out a marble altar which has cost 2000
guineas. The parishioners want the bread of life,
and get the orthodox stone.
Revd. Inglia, of Waiapu (N.Z.), says the
belief in universal salvation is “ pleasing to the
carnal mind.” Bad look-out for Inglis when this
belief becomes universal too.
A Melbourne clergyman went to sleep in
his pulpit during morning service Sunday before
last. The incident is considered peculiar as he
was not preaching at the time.
Canon Soares recently delivered a lecture
at Goulburn (N.S.W.) on “money.” The local
paper noted that he “ handled his subject well.”
That is a way the clergy have got.
The Christian World (Sydney) leads off
a scathing article with the words : “ What is the
reward for lying ?” It all depends on the style of
the journal for which the lying is provided Some
editors receive £lO a week and some only 10s.
Speaking of the growing penchant of
clergymen for “ annexing ” the sermons, lectures,
and general brain-work of other men, the S. M.
Herald asks, “ How can any man accurately
state where he obtained all his mental furniture ?”
Bishop Barry is to return to Australia
proforma, but will at once resign his See and pro-
ceed to England to rejoin Mrs. Barry, who firmly
declines to live in Australia. As so many Aus-
tralian prelates are on the move it is suggested by
a Sydney newspaper that an import and export
duty be placid by the “ kawlinies ” upon bishops.
The C. E. Synod of Melbourne has decreed
that in future appointments to bishoprics in Aus-
tralia local men shall have their claims for the
positions honestly considered. This will be a
further incentive to parsons to keep their names
well to the front by writing regularly to the cor
respoadence columns of the S. M. Herald and
Argus.
Archdeacon Julius, of Ballarat, declares
that the custom of offering prizes for the be si-
dressed young ladies at rinking contests, and so
on, “i» simply inviting them to come to the devil.”
As one of the chief incentives young ladies have
for attending church is to show off their head-
gear we want to hear the rink-proprietor’s
opinion as to the fate which awaits the girls who
go to hear Archdeacon Julius.
Canon Wilberforce recently declared that
brewing and distilling are the main industries of
Dublin, that one Protestant Cathedral was built
by porter-brewing, the other by whisky-distilling,
and the largest Presbyterian chapel there was
also ra ; sed by a whisky-manufacturer. Father
Gonsdvo Kavanagh should now figure out how
much of St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, has been
built by the brewers and publicans,
At the closing services in connection with
the Pan-Anglican Conference, in St. Paul’s
Cathedral, London, the Archbishop of York de-
clared that Socialism is “ the result of avarice and
luxury.” He might have gone a step farther, and
pointed to the “ frightful examples ” of these vices
which are to be found amongst the ranks of the
clergy. On the other hand, the human misery
accruing from avarice and luxury is the result of
our not having Socialism.
Though that godly organ of parsondom
the Melbourne D.T. professes a holy horror of the
turf, still it reports race-meetings, training-
gallops, and starting prices, while the unregenerate
Evening ’Erald utterly ignores these things—for
Editor Winter reserves the turf for his other
organ, the Sportsman. To be consistent the D.T.
should follow the example of Sir Edward Baines,
of the Leeds Mercury, who eliminated from his
paper all allusion to horse-racing.
The Model Suburb Notion.
In Sydney, the City of the Beautiful Harbour, a
city furnished by Nature with a site, on a lavish
scale, of hill and dale and inlet, creek and bay,
the system of overcrowding bids fair to rival in i‘s
stifliog density any aggregation of human dwell
ings on the face of the earth. The same system
that crams two or three “ drunks” in one narrow
cell and packs crowds into buildings whence in
the case of fire is no escape, op; rates to build
workmen’s model dwelling-houses and ventures to
palm off the hugglesome horrors of French fl its
upon a trusting and apathetic co nmunity in the
name of heaven-inspire 1 and heartfelt charity.
It is too thin ! In business we believe the re is
very little philanthropy, yet in business also
there is much sense shown in providing the best
article for a people who have the money to pay
for the luxury cf having what they want
Sydney is one of the most beautiful, and at the
same time one of the most hideous, cities on the
face of the earth. The beauty is Nature’s, the
hideousness is man’s. A tremendous sheet of
water capable of affording anchorage to the navies
of the world indents, in a hundred coves and bay-
lets, the outline of the city-shores. High ridges
swept by the ocean breeze, gently graduated
valleys, steep descents, grassy knolls, and ver-
durous slopes exist only to afford man an oppor-
tunity of dressing beauty in a garb of ugliness.
Glued side by side, with a brain straining uni-
formity are streets upon streets of stifling, stuffy,
soggy terraces with Lilliputian yards badly
drained, rooms badly lighted, ventdated not at
all 5 rows rather of fever-dens and z motic disease
depdts than human habitations. Recently, how-
ever, a company has been formed with the purpose
of building a model suburb, and this company
has been so successful as to obtain for the purpose
1000 acres of the best land outside Sydney. It
is portion of the famous Cooper Estate, and bears
the old-world name of Kensington Park, situated
to the south-east of what are known as the
Eastern S iburbs. The promoters intend to avoid
the possibility of unsightliness and unhealthiness
in their model suburb ; which, by the way, adjoins
Moore Park on its southern boundary—a broad
surface of breeze-swept and undulating landscape
This area has long been leased to the Sydney
Municipal Corporation as part of the Botany
watershed, and it is intended to erect thereon an
actual extension of the City, laid out on most
modern principles and affording all the advantages
and conveniences provided in this age of advanced
scientific and hygenii knowledge and engineering
skill. The tramline will be extended from the
Moore Park and Crown street termini, and
will probably bisect the estate; Mr. E. D.
Cowdery has been secured to make a minute and
perfect levelling survey of the whole area ; public
and private squares will be provided ; a complete
and ideal system of sewerage and drainage
will be aimed at; and the Legislature will be
asked to constitute the estate —which is large
enough to the bounds o' amplitude for such a pur-
pose—into a separate municipality, and to pa’s a
special Building Act to insure the comfort and
convenience of the purchasers. In addition, this
model suburb will contain mews for the keeping
of horses, cows, and fowls, and thus set
apart from the area reserved for human
habitation the noises and smells of the cow-
shed, the poultry-yard, and the stable. Here will
be built houses of whatsrver acceptable tj ps the
purchasers of the land may please, subject, of
course, to a special Building Act, on allotments of
a quarter-an acre each. There will be heard in
this model suburb no fish-criers, no milkmen, no
butchers, no roar of street traffic, of tram or train,
no shrieking of steamboat-whistles, no blast of
foghorns, no chatter of parrots, no tinkettling of
pianos, no bands of Ten; on origin, no organs re-
lated to monkeys or irritated into discord by the
sallow Neapolitan, and the voice cf the Salva-
tionist will be hushed in the land. These at
least are some of the advantages claimed
for their model suburb by the members of
the syndicate, and if it be but only a tithe of
what they claim we shall be forced to remark
at some future date when this splendid ideal is
realised, in the language of Dr. Watts :
We have been there and still would go
’Tis like a little heaven below.
In the meantime, we shall draw off and await
developments.
