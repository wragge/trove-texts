The Modern Play
Galsworthy, after his masterpieces, The
Silver Box, Strife and Justice, relapses to
lighter things. He still has something to
say; but he says it carelessly, and in The
Little Dream (Duckworth) he does not
say it at all. This allegory in six scenes,
in which mountains, flowers, moth children,
things in books,” “death by drowning,” “the
form of what is made by work,” and other
pale abstractions are the chief characters, is
vague, unconvincing and quite undramatic.
The Pigeon, a fantasy in three acts (Duck-
worth), is at least a play. The pigeon is
a charitable man, whom, of course, it is the
life business of all spongers to pluck. Into
his studio come an assortment of unfortu-
nates, to whom in charitable moments he has
given his card —a flower-girl whose husband
ill-treats her; a French vagabond, Ferrand,
who sees from the first that Wellwyn, the
Pigeon,„is no Christian—“ You have so kind
a face”; and Timson, a drunken cabman.
Wellwyn makes them all comfortable in his
• studio.
Jt
The comedy is an indictment of charity.
As the French vagabond says : “How anxious
are the tame birds to do the wild birds good
—the type of wild savage existing ever
amongst our high civilisation. For the wild
birds it is not funny. There is in some*
human souls, Monsieur, what cannot he
made tame.” The results of Wellwyn’s
efforts to tame the wild birds is that Timson
gets 14 days for drunkenness, and tries
to coni mi t suicide; the vagabond recognises
that the world wishes him to die, and natur-
ally decides to live; while the flower-girl, as
1 errand says: “In her, too, -there is some--
thing of wild-savage. She must have joy of
life. 1 have seen her since I came' back.
She has embraced the life of joy. It is not
quite the same thing.”
* (O ,A S himself, the vagabond says:
. Since I saw you, Monsieur, I have been
in three institutions. They are palaces.
One may eat on the floor —though it is true
—-tor kings—they eat too much of skillv
there. One little thing, they lack—those
palaces. It is understanding of the ’uman
heart. In them tame birds pluck wild
birds naked....Ah! Monsieur, I am loafer
waster—what you like—for all that (Ut-
terly) poverty is my only crime. If I were
nch, should I not be simply veree original,
ighly respected, with soul above commerce,
travelling to see the world? And that young
girl, would she not be ‘that charming
ladee, veree chic, you know!’ And the old
J-ims—good old-fashioned gentleman—drink-
ing Ins liquor well. Eh! bien —what are
we now? Dark beasts, despised by all.
lhat is life, Monsieur... .Those sirs, with'
their theories, they can clean our skins and
chain our ’abits—that soothes for them the
aesthetic sense; it gives them, too, their
good little importance. But our spirits
they cannot touch, for they nevare
understand., Without that, Monsieur, all
is as dry as a parched skin of orange....
But when all is done, there are always us
hopeless ones. _ Ah! Monsieur, we, too,
ave our qualities, we others —it wants you
courage to undertake a career like mine, or
like that young girl’s. We wild ones—we
know a thousand times more of life than
ever will those sirs. They waste their time
to mak© rooks white. Be kind to us
if you will, or let us alone like Mees Ann,
but do not try to change our skins.... But
we in whom something moves—like that
flame, Monsieur, that cannot keep still—
we others —we are not many—that must
have motion in our lives, do not let them
make us prisoners, with their theories, be-
cause we do not like them—it is life itself
they would enclose!”
&
The climax comes with the rescue by a
constable of the flower-girl from the river.
She is revived—and is led awav to be
charged with . attempted suicide. As Well-
wyn. unavailingly protests: “This poor,
wretched little girl—you know what that
life means better than anyone. Why! It’s
to her credit to try to jump out of "it!
•Not a soul in the world wants her alive—
and now she’s to be prosecuted for trying
to be where everyone wishes her.”
“That makes the third of us,” says Fer-
rand. “We are not in luck. To wish us
dead, it seems, is easier than to let us die.”
The Pigeon is a striking sermon, loosely
constructed, and weakened by the conven-
tionally drawn figures of two official re-
formers. Galsworthy is at home not with
officials but with his outcasts. While not
increasing the reputation of the playwright,
this fantasy is an excellent comedy. But
through it there is a hint that Galsworthy
is getting tired. That for the modern drama
would be a tragedy.
The futility of charity is also the theme
of an interesting, though slighter, play, by
George Calderon, .entitled The Fountain
(Gowans and Gray, Glasgow). This
comedy appears in the Glasgow Repertory
Plays series, marvellously got up for 6d.
Altogether, the Glasgow Repertory Thea-
tre, founded by Glasgow business men, has
since its foundation in 1009 produced 52
plays, and paid its way. Calderon’s thesis
is that “all the evil that, matters is pro-
duced, not by evil intention, as is generally
supposed, but by y good intention working
through the complicated channels of our
social system.” Accused of being a Shavian,
Calderon exclaims: “How naive and old-
fashioned after this seems ‘Widowers’
Houses,’ with its slum-landlord grinding
the faces of the poor ! Bernard Shaw, like
Lloyd George and all those nurtured in the
Socialism of the early ’BQ’s, still believes
in the fantastic old Wicked Rich myth.”
Shaw old-fashioned! This to G.B.S. will
be the lowest Shavian hell.
The Red Page
The Fountain merely illustrates the econ-
omic fact that all money given to the poor
is gained by making another section of the
poor work harder. The charitable rich man
gets the surplus cash for his charities by
taking more than his fair share of the
wealth created by the poor.
In a flat in Boodle Court, in the slum
district of London, a young wife decides to
settle and relieve the noor tenants of the
building. She finds that her scheme needs
more money, and her lawyers contrive to
raise the extra income. With the assistance
of a parson and some friends she advances
money, on no security. But she discovers
that their rents have all been raised by six-
pence a week; and. outraged by. this impost,
she determines to discover the rack-renting
owner of the block. Of course, given the
thesis, it turns out that she is the owner
of the block ; and her lawyers have merely
raised her income by putting the extra six ; -
penee on to her tenants’ rents. What came
from the fountain has gone back to the foun-
tain.
The only sensible character in the comedy
rubs the moral in : “If there were no charity
and no beer in London the social ouestion
would be solved in a week ; neither the rich
nor the poor could endure things any longer
.... When we want to enjoy the -luxury of
virtuous indignation, we talk of Mr. Bung the
Brewer and Mr. Rackrent the Landlord as
if they were a separate sort of creature from
ourselves, only fit to be used as Oekshies
and Aunt Sallies. Who is Mr. Bung? Who
is Mr. Rackrent ? lam ; you are Now
you see what charity means. All the money
youve been spending on Oliver’s parishion-
ers was being pumped up into your horn of
plenty out of Oliver’s parishioners’ pockets
all the time. There they were, the poor
tenants; and at the top of all, yourself,
liKe a nymph on a fountain, pouring the
wafer back into the basin. That’s charity!
1 hat s why we erect fountains at street cor-
ners to philanthropical gentlemen. It’s an
allegory, a satire.”
«rr^ disillusioned woman replies:
lhere was a picture that I always loved
all my childhood, of a tall lady in white
giving money out of a purse to ihe poor - I
always wanted to be like that. But now I
know how the purse is filled....Oh, I’ll
smash that beastly picture.”
The play is wordy, slight, and with but
this tenuous plot; but it was worth writing.
■J*
Other plays in this series are The Pro-
bationer, by Anthony Rowley, a thin, Scotch
thing not worth production, and The Price
of Coal, by Harold Brighouse, a one-act
play of a coal pit in Lanarkshire, where the
women, when the pit bell clangs announcing
an accident, do not rush to the pit mouth
but stay at home and “get things ready,”
and where, as the old mother, expecting to
find her son brought in dead, as his father
was before him, tonelessly says: “There’s
wimmen keepin’ hoose in the places the coal
goes that pay fur their coal wi’ brass We
pay a-sight heavier fur it here. We pay wi’
the lives o’ men.” It is an effective drama-
tic_piece.;_but it has not the tense strength
ot .Louis Esson’s Dead Timber.
* *
Two Plays by Tchelcliof, translated by
Leorge Calderon (Grant Richards), show
two aspects of the great Russian dramatist.
i he seagull has resemblances to the modern
Lnghsh drama; The Cherry Orchard is
rabid Russian. Neither play would have
been accepted by Mr. J. C. Williamson,
but the Melbourne Repertory Theatre in-
tends producing The Seagull this year. The
translator attempts an elaborate explanation
ot Ichpkhof s dramatic intention, which is
not in the least dramatic. The attitude of his
audience must be that “the sentiments to be
aroused by the doings and sufferings of the
personages on his stage are not feo much
hope and fear for their individual misfor-
tunes as pity and amusement at the import-
ance which they set on them, and consola-
tion for their particular tragedies in the
spectacle of the general comedy of Life in
which they are all merged.” He deals in
group emotions.”
“He shows us his little group of person-
ages all subjected to the same influence or
generating the same impulse at the same
time. In most plays the action is continu-
ous; there are episodes, or byways, but all
lead into the main road. In Tehekhof’s plays
many things are said and done which have
no bearing on the action, but are directed
only to creating the atmosphere. The players
have to show, by difference of tone and ges-
ture when they are speaking to the action,
which concerns them as individuals, and
when they are speaking to the atmosphere,
which concerns them as members of a group,
ihe spectators have to distinguish what is
painted in low tones, and what stands sharply
out, in order to grasp the central design.”
Xchekhbf preaches the doctrine of irrespon-
sibility: that Evil in the world does not
arise from Evil in men, but is a constant
element in life, flowing not out of men’s
souls, but through them—a thesis that, as
we have seen, Calderon makes good use of in
his play. The Fountain . He even suggests
that Galsworthy has merely substituted a
phantom of Society for the old bogie of the
\\ leked Rich. “Mr. Galsworthy, with his
benevolent air, is a great hater, essentially
a thwacker. But Tchekhof hated no-
tlnng and no one. He would not have said.
Woe unto you!’ even to the Pharisees, but
would have written short stories to explain
their attitude.” And this Russian dramatist
contrives to get along without villains or
heroes. His drama is not a drama of Con-
flicting wills. He does not invite you to stake
your sympathies on this side or on that.
“All his characters are ranged together
against the common enemy, Life, whether
they are drawn up in two battalions or in
one.”
J*
Both plays are, considered from even
modern standards, essentially undramatic.
They deal with Russian people who are lack-
ing in any fierce belief about anything, who
drift from one impasse into another, whose
griefs and joys are lukewarm and but half-
comprehended—feckless “job-lots,” to use the
term employed so often to designate the
characters in The Cherry Orchard. Yet you
get, even from the reading, an impression
that such people are, and an overwhelming
consciousness of the dreary atmosphere that
envelopes them. This is the sort of talk that
occurs:—
Nina: What does fame feel like? What
sensation does it produce in you?
Trigorin: What sensation? Evidently
none. I never thought about it. One of
two things; either you exaggerate my fame,
or fame produces no sensation.
Nina : But if you read about yourself
in the papers?
Trigorin : When they praise me, I like it;
when they abuse me, I feel low-spirited for
a day or two. . . .We'll talk about my delight-
ful, brilliant life.... Day and night I am
obsessed by the same persistent thought; I
must write, I must write, I must write. No
sooner have I finished one story than I am
somehow compelled to write another, then a
third. I write without stopping, except to
change horses like a postchaise. I have no
choice. It’s a dog’s life! 1 see a cloud
shaped like a grand piano. I think: I must
mention somewhere in a story that a cloud
went by, shaped like a grand piano. I smell
heliotrope. I say to myself: Sickly smell,
mourning shade, must be mentioned in des-
cribing a summer evening. I lie in wait for
each phrase, for each word that falls from
my lips or yours, and hasten to lock all these
words and phrases away in my literary work-
may come in handy some day. ...
When I finish a piece of work, I fly to the
theatre or go fishing, in the hope of resting,
ot forgetting myself: but no, a new subject
is already turning, like a heavy iron ball, in
my brain, some invisible force drags me to
my table, and I must make haste to write
and write. And so on for ever and ever
Nina: But surely inspiration and the pro-
cess ot creation give you sublime and happv
moments? '
Trigorin : Yes. It’s a pleasant feeling
writing; and looking over proofs is pleasant,
too. But as soon as the thing is published,
my heart sinks, and I see that it is a failure,
a mistake, that I ought not to have written
at all.
This is interesting, and apparently it is
modern Russian dramatic art.
J*
Tchekhof was born in 1860, and died in
1904. The Seagull was produced in 1896, in
St. Petersburg. It was an utter failure.
Tchekhof wrote that everybody assured him
that the characters were all lunatics, that his
technique was clumsy, and the play obscure.
The next year it was put on by the Artistic
Theatre in Moscow, and scored a brilliant
success! The Cherry Orchard was Tchekhof s
last play, produced in Moscow in 1904, when
the author vims already a dying man. The
first performance was the occasion of a pub-
lic scene of homage to his successful genius.
Ben Hall’s executors should have a roy-
alty on the novels that are made out of his
bushranging exploits. The latest is The
Devd'-s Nightcap, by Lancelot Booth
(N.S.W. Bookstall Co.), illustrated by
Lionel Lindsay. It ends with the approved
moral that the only dividend of an invest-
ment in bushranging is a bullet, imprison-
ment or the gallows.
According to the editors, M. P. Hansen
and D. McLachlan, of An Austral Garden;
an Anthology of Australian Verse (George
Robertson), there are 87 poets in Austral-
asia. Bertram Stevens, the editor of The
Golden Treasure of Australian Ver%>. pub-
lished some years ago, found then only 72.
Neither the falling birthrate, nor the slump
in the demand for short lengths in metrical
goods can stop the production of bards.
Though this collection, primarily intended
for the use of our schools—a praiseworthy
hope—includes 39 poets that have been so
far strangers to an Australian anthology, in
a number of cases the poems quoted do not
excuse their inclusion. However, there can-
not be too many anthologies, if our owh poets
are to become known to ourselves; and this
300-page book of selections will doubtless
fulfil Its purpose. In their preface the edi-
tors rightly .demolish the over-seas conviction
that our poetry is a thing of gloom. The
time of gloom is past. Possibly this may be
due to the rise in the price of poetrv, con-
comitant with the steady and unalterable
price of beer.
The Historical Novel
The historical novel is a bastard form of
art. For it deals with an epoch that is dead,
and is written and read by the inhabitants
of an epoch'that is living. We apply the
standards of our own time to judge a time
that had its owfi different standards of judg-
ment. We can no more recreate that past
epoch than we can create an epoch of the
future; for to appraise a past age the
reader must himself belong to that age. No
matter how well the author has carried out
his task, no matter how conscientiously and
how diligently lie has studied and used the
documents of his chosen epoch, his readers
come to his story soaked in the environment
of the present: what they read is merely a
translation—and a translation, from a for-
eign language, as from a foreign epoch, but
lights its subject from the outside, not from
the core. While a man must be judged by
the standards of his age, the modern novel-
reader instinctively judges the hero of an
historical novel by the prejudices of this cen-
tury.
Thus, taking such an historical romance
as The Order of Release, by 11. de Vere
Stacpoole (Hutchinson, per Hockley Li-
brary), the author, in order to.snatch the
sympathy of the reader for his hero, takes
pains to rehabilitate him for modern morals.
His hero, in the Paris of Louis XV., has to
steal a document from the house of a kins-
man and friend, in order to save the lives
of his fellow conspirators. Being of his
age, such a man would not have a moment
hesitated to commit the necessary theft; yet
Stacpoole shows him to us swayed by a re-
pugnance against the act, and only convinced
of its justification when he learns —a thing
that in his age he would have known from
boyhood—that in affairs of this sort honor
does not count. All this to enlist our modern
sympathy for his hero. True, the author
does not make a similar slip with regard to
his heroine. She is no simpering innocent,
this widow who confesses her lapses to her
lover; though Stacpoole permits her sur-
prise that her. lover takes her confession so
lightly. In that epoch we may assume that
men were less censorious of womell than
in ours. For the rest, Stacpoole piles ad-
venture, amour, plot and counterplot so
swiftly and so deftly upon each other, that
in tlie end the reader, delighted at the verve
of the dialogue and the humor of the situa-
tions, is nevertheless rather uncertain what
“the order of release” is, and why such a
strenuous effort should have been necessary
to get possession of it.
In taking Queen Elizabeth for his heroine
in The Lonely Queen (Methuen, per Lock-
ley Library), H. C. Bailey surmounts the
similar inherent difficulty of the incompata-
bility of Elizabethan and modern morals.
For the character" of Elizabeth is, for us,
fixed in history. We accept her coldness,
her unscrupulousness,. her selfishness, her
lack of decision. It is Bailey’s task to in-
terpret this historical figure by the record of
her life, to show her to us from her childhood
to her accession, to insist on the importance
her environment of insecurity and fear had
in moulding her. And the author does his
work supremely well. This novel claims a
second place to such a work of Hewlett’s as
Richard Yea-and-Nay. It has not the color
of that master’s work ; but it is almost as
ably done. Elizabeth is no lay figure for his
clothing: she emerges a living personality—
not a pleasant nor an admirable one, but use-
ful for her time and for her England. There
is, too, much good character drawing in the
host of dependents, statesmen, courtiers, sol-
diers and sailors who fill in the background
for that regal figure. The Lonely Queen is
a sombre bit of tapestry, but the colors are
admirably placed, and the design craftsroan-
like. The work should be read more widely
than it is likely to be.
The ■ Scottish Australasian for April ap-
pears in magazine form, price saxpence.
With enlarged contents, and af more Aus-
tralasian flavor this publication of Wm.
Brooks, Sydney, seems to fill its corner.
The ethical view of the universe involves
us at last in so many cruel and absurd con-
tradictions (says Joseph Conrad, in Some
Reminiscences ),, where the last vestiges of
faith, hope, charity, and even of reason
itself, seem ready to perish, that I have come
to suspect that the aim of creation cannot be
ethical at all. I would fondly believe that
its object is purely spectacular: a spectacle
for awe, love, adoration or hate if you like,
but in this view-—and in this view alone—
never, for despair ! Those visions, delicious
or poignant, are a moral end in themselves.
The rest is our affair —the laughter, the
tears, the tenderness, the indignation, the
high tranquility of a steeled heart, the de-
tached curiosity of a subtle mind—-that’s our
affair! And the unwearied self-forgetful at-
tention to every phase of the living universe
reflected in our consciousness may be our
appointed task on this earth. A task in
which fate has'"-perhaps engaged nothing of
us except our conscience, gifted with a voice
in order to bear true testimony to the visible
wonder, the haunting terror, the infinite
passion and the illimitable serenity ; to the
supreme law and the abiding mystery of the
sublime spectacle.

The Corset Makes
The Gown
When you see a woman
with that indefinable air of
being absolutely well-dressed,
you may be sure she is wearing
a good corset.
The D & A and the La Diva
Canadian Corsets are steadily
displacingall competitors, both
in Canada and Australasia.
Our designers get their ideas
fresh from Paris and these
ideas are faithfully carried out
by our large organization of
skillful French-Canadian
work-people.
There
is about
the D&A
and the
La Diva Corsets the unmistakable touch
of style. They give to the figure
long, sweeping lines of grace and beauty.
All good drapers carry the D&A and
the La Diva Corsets, in models suited to
every figure and at reasonable prices
The illustration shows D&A No. 620,
a model well suited to many figures,
with very graceful lines. Ask your
dealer to show you these Corsets.

It is not always the best looking watch
that gives the greatest satisfaction. A
smart looking case does not necessarily
mean Timekeeping Quality. Accuracy and
reliability of movement or works, and the
reputation of its makers should have first
consideration.
The discriminating buyer has a way of
looking deeper than the outward finish of a
watch. He is not misled merely by pretty
outward appearance.
Over 25.000,000 discriminating Buyers in
England, America, Canada, Germany,
and South Africa, and in almost all
parts of the Globe, have tried and tested
Ingersoll Watches
and have found them exactly as represented by the makers. The most
practical, economical and perfect watch that money will buy. Now, for
the first time, we are able to offer Australia this wonderful scientific
production, so if you are ready for a cheap watch and believe that 6/6
entitles you to a reliable timekeeper, be sure to ask for an Ingersoll, and
look for the name on dial, and guarantee in back of case. They are
there for YOUR protection.

The cable muddle again. This was how Adelaide
Evening Journal put it: —
“TAX ON OATS.
“A GERMAN IDEA.
“HEAVY DEFENCE BURDENS.
“Berlin, April 5.
“The Imperial Chancellor (Dr. von Bethmann-
Holweg) is studying the question of imposing taxa-
tion upon the owners of cats as a means of contribut-
ing to the heavy financial defence burdens of the
country.”
Next morning the Register, issued from the same
office, thought better of it, and it appeared thus: —
“TAXATION AND DEFENCE.
u “London, April 5.
‘The Berlin correspondent of the Standard tele-
graphs that the German Imperial Chancellor (Dr. von
Bethmann-IIolweg) is closely studying the Taxation
Acts in connection with Germany’s new defence bur-
dens.”
And now the country staggers heavily in face of
the conundrum—When is an Act not a cat?

“J.G.” : Ballarat Evening Echo is expected to defini-
tely go Labor in the next few weeks. Most of the direc-
tors are confessed Laborites. Strenuous efforts are being
made to secure 10,000 new subscribers. When this
occurs, the Courier will wonder which tombstone
hit it, and if the new Labor paper should come out
as a morning daily, the Tory sheet will wonder
more than ever. The Courier, when owned by Bate-
man and Clark, and later by Robert Clark, was one
of the most advanced democratic dailies of Victoria.
Under those conditions its circulation was about the
largest outside of Melbourne. It was one of the
few sheets that stood by the railway men when they
made their historic fight for civil and political
liberty. Since kindly old Bob Clark died, however,
it has been drifting “Liberal”-wards, and now it is,
to all intents and purposes, in the same camp as the
Age and the Argus.
“Button-stick”: How’s this for a mild exhorta-
tion from a meek apostle of Peace? A letter to the
Maoriland Worker runs: “Don’t you think it is
public press, journalists, editors and writers,
that you gave up prostituting your mentality for
the benefit of the military and capitalist class? Up,
up, like men—damn your bread and butter; now is
the time for manly action; we have had enough
crawling. _ Come and help in the fight.” The
writer evidently sees nothing wrong in pulling off
his coat and wading in to fight the editors and ink-
slingers, _ or whoever it is he is hankering to Donny-
brook with, and I suppose the only ones he has con-
scientious scruples about scrapping with are his
dear brothers the Japs or Chinese, or other possible
invaders. Perhaps he thinks that when the Jap comes
along he’ll present arms to the Maoriland Worker,
and greet him with a cordial “Pass Friend,” and
allow him to keep right on with his job. It
doesn t seem to strike him that the business-end of
the rifle will be presented, and the pass will be the
last pass out to another and warmer climate, where
the lava billy is boiled. Anyhow, if that’s how
the devotees of the dove wave the peaceful olive
branch, I wonder what sorter language they’d erupt
if they really got annoyed and wanted to shake a
war-club ?

Howard Willoughby, of Melbourne Argus, was pro-
bably the worst and most illegible manufacturer of
manuscript that Australia ever produced. According
to the latest instalment of Henry Lucy’s reminiscen-
ces in London Cornhill, the late Colonel Fred
Burnaby, author of the famous “Ride to Khiva,”
wrote a fist almost as atrocious as Willoughby’s.
A novel, by Burnaby, was sent to Lucy, who says:
“After diligent endeavor I could not make out more
than a sentence here and there. It looked as if
Burnaby had pulled a twig out of a hedge, mixed
a little blacking, and then gone ahead. With the
horrible exception of Dean Stanley’s, Burnaby’s writ-
ing was the worst I ever saw.” The novel referred
to was never published, for the simple reason that
the greater part of it was undecipherable, even to
experts in villainous handwriting. [Some day The
BuLLETra will publish screed about its legible and
illegible coni:;—'tors, also about good and bad pen-
m6n v S known > an d poets whose fists suggested
a cat-fight. Among the writers of good matter whose
penmanship was, or is, a joy to the compositor, it
remembers (1) the late Victor Daley; (2) R. J.
Cassidy; (3) “Kodak”; (4) Edmund Fisher; also
Emerson and C. J. Dennis. Among the prize ille-
gibles, it mentions with regret the man who wrote the
above par. about the illegibleness of Howard Will-
oughby.]

“Nightowl” : Let the Australian Journalists’ Asso-
-ICm be upstanding, and put its best ear forward.
While nearly all the pressmen in the various cities
have been enlisted into the Association’s ranks, the
provincial journalists (I speak for Queensland in par-
ticular) are nearly all outside. Add to these—and
they include a considerable number of passable pen-
men the crop of “literary cadets” that is coming
on, and the Ass. will observe that in the event of
trouble there will be no lack of material with which
to wallop it. The rural journalists have got to be
brought into line somehow, but sending out dodgers
from headquarters is no good. An organiser to go
from town to town, and put the matter directly to
the inkies in each, is what I vote for. And what
about the A.J.A. having a paper of its own? The
comps, have one. It might not be a bad thing for
the two interests to unite. Anyhow, it would bring
the cause of the joint unions before non-members and
others more or less interested. We’ll wait till the
Bang of Doom before the employers’ newspapers do
it!

H. C. Lingham is publishing a second edition of
“The Litany of Love and Other Poems,” which ele-
gantly printed volume first came to light 12 years
ago. The burden of H.C.L.’s song is “put me among
the girls,” and the book has a decidedly fruity flavor.
As, for instance:—
How soft their lips! As richly red in hue
As the blood orange, and as luscious, too!
Yea, but to suck them were to feel a flood
Of sweet sensations tingling through the blood.
This hardly harmonises with the bard’s occasional
appearances on the Salon platform in the early
Roman rig of Virginius, and is rather at variance
with his tendency to a long frock-coat, and hat to
match ; but a second edition—after such a long in-
terval—suggests that the scholastic Mr. Lingham has
a notion of what his public wants. The book in-
cludes the “Love Prayer of Giovanna 11., Queen of
Naples,” introduced with an apolegetic text: “Not
with more ardor bills the milk-white dove, than
woman raging in excess of love.” Fancy!
* * * *
“Chasuble”: There is difference of opinion, even
in churches, on the wisdom of circulating Bibles.
However, I glean statistics from the English Bible
Society, which has lately opened very fine quarters
in Flinders-lane, Melbourne. All the extant plays
of Sophocles come from a single MS. in the
Laurentian Library, Florence. There are 4000 Greek
MSS. of the New Testament. The fiyst book printed
was the Latin Bible, of which 100 other editions
appeared before the year 1500. Estimated 24,000,000
copies of Dickens have been circulated. Mrs. Wood’s
novels claim over 5,000,000. Hall Gaine counts
millions. Zola, in French, exceeds two and a half
million. The world’s output of Bibles or parts of
the Bible, for 1909 alone was about fifteen million
Considerably over 3,000,000 sold in China that year,
but principally of Gospels or Psalms. Homer has
been translated into over 20 languages. Shakspeare
and Tolstoy are each translated into 33 languages.
Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress” is in 111 languages
and dialects. The whole, or parts of the Bible, have
been published in over 530 languages or dialects.
Thirty-five new languages were added between 1904
and 1909. It is alleged that 62 languages are spoken
in Tiflis. In China there is the Wenli Bible, in
the literary language, and the Mandarin, in the most
widely current vernacular. Also, in 15 other Chinese
dialects, each spoken by millions. Copies of the
first Bible ever printed in Rome, in 1471, cost £5O.
Coverdale’s Bible, in England, cost £6. The Bible
Society sells a complete Bible for 6d., but it only
gets back 7s. 6d. in the £ of its whole expenditure.
More than 9,000,000 penny Testaments have been
sold, at a loss of over £25,000. After digging up
all these facts, I feel entitled to half a million years’
rest.

derived from its use. I now sleep well and feel strong again, and have

THl]\r WOMEN !
A thin woman is not necessarily plain, let alone ugly. In
fact, many thin women possess very pretty, “sweet faces,” hut
this is usually admitted with the qualifying phrase, “but,
poor thing, she is so dreadfully thin.

bosom. With these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a rarity.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages of ill-health have
sought and accepted this advice, and to-day are models of
womanly development and examples of perfect health.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-Food is a haxanless, perfect fiesli-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week.

The Gods of Empire.
Yet as surely as night succeeds day, so surely will
the greatest of our Empire wane when the God Who
has made her what she is is forgotten.— The Dean of
Newcastle, N.S.W.
Now, many and strange are the gods of Mankind,
And rare are the honors to each one assigned ;
And some gods are mighty, and some gods are small,
But the gods who build Empires are greater than all!
That these gods may be kind
Do we praise them, and dance;
Lo! a god who is blind—
’Tis the great god Chancel
To the gods fanes were reared round the rim of the
world;
Some have long disappeared—to Oblivion hurled!
Their altars lie hidden by river and hill,
But the gods who build Empires abide with us still—
Odin, Jupiter, Bel, *
Long ago ran their course,
But all Earth owns the spell
Of the great god Force!
Grim and high were the groves of the gods that we
trace
In the march of the tribes o’er a Continent’s face;
And far fell the blaze of the fierce light that shone
At the knees of their deities, vanished and gone!
But a god still survives
Whom the Nation’s adore,
And men yield up their lives
To the great god War!
With the Sword and the Torch, War attends upon
Man —
As the Ancient of Days he goes forth in the van;
Though the shadow of Death is the glance of his eyes,
Where he sets his dread foot, lo! the Empires arise!
And, behind him, to close
The red wounds War has made,
And to give men repose,
Comes the great god Trade!
A marvellous Builder of Empires is he 1
His gems are the cities, his robe is the sea;
In the paths of his pride men their quarrels forget,
And the East and the West in his gateways are met—
High the favor he flings
To the keen and the bold;
Lo! his brother upsprings—
’Tis the great god Gold 1
A sly god, a mean god, but potent for ill—
Woe, woe to that Empire he bends to his will!
For Justice he taketh to slay in his toils,
And Honor and Truth are debased as his spoils!
Dull, knavish and yellow,
On hearts doth Gold feed,
Till cometh his fellow—
The great god Greed!
Behold, then, the Empire these great gods have
made!
War pacing her marches —her marts gorged by
Trade —
Gold throned at her centre, in governance skilled—
With Greed madly heaping the measure thrice-filled!
, The mind it bewilders
To think on such sway,
Yet, these are the Builders
Of Empires to-day 1
Chance, Force, War, and Trade; Gold, and Greed
named, divine !
To each is his worship—to each is his shrine —■
The smoke of their altars goes up evermore!
To the gods who build Empires libations we pour—
And though they be many,
One bowl we must grant
To a greater than any—
The great god Cant !

Bulgy Ben.
Down in Darling Harbor’s slime,
Where the rats abide,
Once a rotten wharf for lime
Wobbled with the tide.
Bulgy Ben, a dismal dwarf,
With a dismal cough,
All-night watchman at the wharf,
Shooed the curious off.
He’d his favorite rats, had Ben,
Hated brats and cats
And the sanitary men—
Hunters, all, of rats.
Every whiskered rat was named;
There were twenty-six
Special pets, polite and tamed,
Learning parlor-tricks.
Once two daring sailor-men,
In a gunny-bag
Stowed some contraband, and Ben
Saw the middle sag.
So he ripped it open and
Counted bottles ten
Of an old familiar brand
Dear to sailor-men.
Bottles ten of ruby rum
And a Stilton cheese !....
Ben sat down and tasted some,
Trembling at the knees.
’Twas a feast for gods indeed,
Soothed his dismal cough;
Fifty rats for cheese did plead
But he shooed them off.
When at last he lay asleep,
Full up to the brim,
Every whiskered rat did creep
Softly up to him.
Crept and nosed him head to knees,
Whined and sniffed again,
Maddened with the smell of cheese,
Furious with pain.
And behind with stealthy tread
Fifty famished cats,
One great tom-cat well ahead,
Stalked the frantic rats.
When at dawn two sailor-men
Sought the contraband,
There were empty bottles ten,
And they knew the brand,
And a battered old tom-cat,
Swearing now and then,
Struggled with a bloated rat....
Nothing left of Ben!

Cars that Challenge Comparison
The merits of Dalgety Cars are such that they successfully withstand
the most searching investigation—the kind that any intending motor-buyer
should wisely make.
The Dalgety Agencies were not accepted at haphazard. The most
careful tests and inquiries were instituted before any individual agency was
taken up. The result is a collection of cars which represent the highest at-
tainment in motor design and construction.
Comfort in riding, economy of running and upkeep,(refinement of design
and appearance characterise them all, as also does sound reliability and
service.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF CITIES.
Deak Bulletin, —The sky-scraper—that
affair that looks like a gigantic toothpick
sticking out of an ant-bed —threatens to come
to Sydney. In a mild form it has come
already, but the more virulent scraper is ex-
pected very shortly, and the most virulent
one will naturally follow. An inhabited pre-
cipice J 13 storeys high, is projected in
George-street, and various other brick and
stone and steel and concrete giants are
planned, with bigger giants to follow. The
architectural sons of Anak are arriving.
Meanwhile a voice prophesies, Jekemiaii-
wise, in the background—the voice of Chief
Fire Brigade man Webb. His longest escape
ladder is only 80ft. high. The height to
which he can shoot water is limited, because
the pressure on ground level isn’t always
satisfactory. Many of the streets are so
narrow that even the appliances he possesses
can’t be used to the best advantage. His
engines can’t get round the corner, and his
ladders can’t find foothold. And when a
building 150 ft. high is burning, and the
adjacent buildings are only 50ft. high, and
the fire escape is only 80ft. high, the people
who have been driven to the roof are just
as far from any hope of rescue as if they
were being burned by the Inquisition three
centuries ago. In such a case 150 ft. are
iust as impassable as twice as many years.
It is satisfactory to know that the sky-
scraper will, in every case, be fireproof, but,
on the other band, there is the lamentable
fact that the fireproof building appears to
burn, if possible, a little faster than the
other sort. So the advent of the tall, gaunt,
ungainly architectural blossom is not a cause
of unmixed happiness.
The purpose of the sky-scraper—the roof
whereof is a flaming man-trap in case of fire
—is to economise valuable city space. The
necessity for economising valuable city space
is obvious enough. Birt here and there a
doubt has arisen whether the building of an
isolated monster in this place or that, with
400 mean buildings around it, and 40 mean
streets or petty lanes around the 400 meau
buildings, is the best form of economy. It
may be the only possible form while Private
Enterprise is the sole landlord, but, again,
no one has proved that'it is necessary for
Private Enterprise to be the landlord It
might prove, on investigation, that national
ownership is just as good in the matter of
business properties in a city as in tne case of
cottage properties at Daceyville. Under pri-
vate control, the waste of space is something
terrible. There are still one-storey shacks

streot, Sydney --the principal street of the
biggest city in Australasia. In George-street.
Pitt-street, Casticreagh-street, Circular Quay
—in fact, afi over the best business section
of the N.S.W. capital—the number of mean
two-storey erections is amazing. Ail these
represent a sacrifice of business space,
but apparently Private Enterprise doesn’t
know how to do things any better. The one
and two-storey buildings are almost invari-
ably old and shabby, and they whl look
especially old and shabby, and grotesque to
boot, if tho fresh new sky-scraper rises along-
side them, bearing the aspect of Goliath
beside a decayed beehive. When the visitor
approaches Sydney by its magnificent water-
gate, the Goliath will be an offence afar off,
and the beehive will be a squalid misery close
at band. Neither of them can possibly make
for beauty, and beauty is a thing which isn’t
considered half so much as it ought to be.
If the streets of Sydney were straight,
and on an average twice tlieir present width,
and the city was built up to a uniform
height of, say, nine or 10 storeys, it would
contain much more business accommodation
than it does now, as well as much more
elbow-room. That kind of uniformity would
only be possible when a single authority
owned everything, and some people say
that uniformity and public ownership
are alike horrible. Yet when the
State maintains a Government which
has stopped land sales on the plea
that all the country land should be-
long to the people, it can’t reasonably
object to the theory that all city build-
ings should belong likewise. The proposition
may be difficult, but it can’t be called sinful
or illogical. It ma£ be argued that in a 10-
storey city the. shop space below would be too
limited in proportion to the super-abundance
of warehouse and ; office and other space
above, but there is no reason why shops
should be confined to the basement. They
have got into the absurd habit of staying
there, down among the mud, the noises, the
tram-cars and the dogs, for want of a con-
tinuous way up above, and there is no such
continuous way, because people can’t balance
along the sloping roof of Isaacstein’s. two-
storey pawnbrokery, and then climb,' fly-
fashion, up the wall to the summit of Rosen-
bloom’s 12-storey providery, and then rush
down the other side of that to the top of
Humbert Pompey’s three-storey fruitery.
But in a city of uniform buildings there
would naturally be a sort of arcade on the
top, accessible by lifts, and with foot bridges
at the street corners, so as to make it a con-
tinuous road through the city. And up there,
in the higher and purer air, away from the
slush and the row and the heavy traffic, a
great deal of the city’s shopkeeping might be
conducted. Pubs, cafes, cigar stores, drap-
eries and other evidences of civilisation might
infest that pleasant roof space, and in an
electrically lighted and heated city there
need be no smoke nuisance. An abundant
water supply on the roof would enable fires
to be attacked from above as well as below.
And if the 10-storey building began to com-
bust about the sixth storey, the people below
the outbreak could make for the street, and
the people above could flee for the roof and
retire at leisure. So far as human life was
concerned, it wouldn’t matter to the inmates
of the building whether the ladders of Super-
intendent Webb were 80ft. or 800 ft. or Bft.
long, or whether he had any ladders at all. One
of the old delusions of architecture is that a
building should be a cul-de-sac stood up on
end, or a perpendicular blind alley, and how
many thousands of people have died miser-
ably because of that delusion no oue will
ever know. It would be bad enough if fire
burned downward, but seeing that ic has a
constant tendency to go upward, the idea
that a house should be an upright funnel,
hermetically plugged at the top with a roof,
is nothing short of architectural murder.
The argument may be advanced on behalf
of the old, irregular, scramblesome order of
things, that a city which was dead level at
the top would be a monotony. In a sense,
the statement would be true, but the same
may be said of modern streets. A smooth,
level, well-kept street may be good for traffic,
but the monotony of it is dreadful. To be
really picturesque, it should be decorated
with gigantic holes and great mounds of
debris, and the buggy should climb up here
like a fly and fall down there like an ava-
lanche. In other words, it should be just as
irregular as the house-tops which are one-
storey high just here and 10 storeys high 7*
yards further on. But there is no positive
reason why the eight- or 10-storey city should
be monotonous. Owing to the hills and dales
its roofways would slope up and down just
like the existing roads. The buildings might
be of different colors, provided they didn’t
become an offence and a horror; and they
might be of every kind of architecture that
can bear inspection. And no one could
object to domes and turrets and steeples
rising above the uniform roof, provided they
lay go far back from. the frontage as not to
the high road —naturally so-called
because it would lie many storeys' higher
than the other road. The high road might
even be carried through the dome or steepie
or turret, if some especially lofty sect or in-
dividual wanted to do something extra in the
way of pomp and adornment, and was will-
ing to pay the State for the goods. This
State-owned city would, of course, be built
well ahead of immediate requirements, for it
wouldn’t be the kind of work that could be
tinkered with daily. As it filled up, and new
demands arose, it would be necessary to re-
sume the residential areas around it and
carry it further out. A time might even
arrive when it would be necessary to put
two extra storeys on the city. That is one
of the drawbacks of the case, but every case
has its drawbacks. Even the present scat-
tered arrangement whereby a Dago fish-shop
16ft. high may stand alongside a gigantic
hew specimen of granite architecture isn’t
perfect.
The x-econstruction of the business part of
Sydney, as a sane and well-ordered and
State-owned city, would be a vast proposi-
tion. Yet Sydney will have to be recon-
structed some day, either according to a well-
ordered plan, or —as is being attempted now
—in a piecemeal sort of way with no plan
whatsoever. Possibly the genuine reconstruc-
tion will not come until after the great
Asiatic invasion and the unutterable smash.
Then when Svdney is rebuilt, like Jerusalem,
men with new ideas will have a show. But'
N.S.W., like some of the other States which
have made Congestion a fetich, badly wants
new coastal cities to relieve the pressure on
the one old bloated centre. No visible reason
exists, apart from the old tradition and the
old habit of dwelling in the old rut, why
these new cities should not be built,
and why they should not be State-owned.
And there is no reason why they should
reproduce the ancient evils which arose
solely because a thousand or 10,000
different private owners claimed the
right. in less enlightened days, to
offend the public eye with their crude
imaginings and their shocking color devices.
The community has got so far as to realise
that the streets, which constitute a large
part of every city, are public property, and
that it is impossible to let every man own
the bit which lies opposite his own door, and
keep it in any sort of condition that seems
good in his eyes. Quite as much may be said
for public ownership of the buildings beside
the streets, especially now that the theory
of compulsory military service has estab-
lished, to some extent, public ownership of
the people who inhabit the buildings and
walk the streets. Again, the community has
found it necessary to rule that the sides of
the buildings shall follow a fixed and regular
line; if it didn’t, there would be no streets
in any reasonable acceptation of the term.
It will he no worse outrage for the commun-
ity to di-aw a fixed line along the tops of the
buildings, thereby eliminating equally the
hovel and the sky-scraper. Every attempt at
town and city improvement, since improve-
ment first began, has been a departure from
the safe old policy, a shameful Attack upon
Liberty, and an intei'ference with Private
Enterprise. The final innovation, which is
complete public ownership of cities, is inevi-
table unless the landlord mends his Ways,
and the sooner it corned the less of the muddle
and debris of Private Enterprise will the
reformers have to clean up.-—Yours, etc.,
HENRY HORSECOLLAR.
THE INTOLERABLE POSITION THAT
HAS BEEN CREATED BY AM
ARCHAIC N.S.W. LAW.
Last week’s majority judgment of the High
Court, in the matter of Spooner v. Alex-
ander, fairly reeks with menace to the cause
of law and order. So much so, that the
S. M. Herald, while frankly pleased with
the decision, expresses a fervent hope that the
employers will not attempt to use the vast
and dangerous powers with which it clothes
them. The trouble started last July, at the
Lithgow works of the Hoskins brothers,
when one Cairnes, a Union delegate, was
summarily Sacked for leaving his work to
attend a Union meeting, Griffith. C.J.,
thus described what followed
On Monday morning, the 17th, a number of the
miners came to Spooner at the office of the mine.
Their spokesman asked if Cairnes was to start work,
to which Spooner replied “No.” The answer was,
“We are not going to start without him.” Mr.
Hoskins then came up, and after a conversation the
men left the works in a body.
At the Lithgow Court of Petty Sessions, a
magistrate found that the men had acted
in contravention of the Masters and Ser-
vants Act, in absenting themselves from
work. The Pull Court of N. S.
Wales unanimously found that they
had not erred in the matter. And
now the High Court, consisting of Justices
Griffith, Barton and Isaacs, have found
by a two-thirds majority (the dissentient
being Isaacs), that the Lithgow magistrate
was right, and that the man who, in N. S.
Wales, absents himself from the service of
a firm “without reasonable cause,” is liable
to go to gaol with hard labor.
* * * *
Said the S. M. Herald the next day:—
No doubt there will be malcontents who think that
the judgment of the High Court is wrong, but it is
now the law of the land as laid down by the highest
tribunal, and will continue to be so unless and until
the Legislature otherwise provides. It is to be hoped
that the Legislature will not so provide.
It is a fair measure of the liberalism of
"Liberalism” that such sentiments should
emanate from the chief organ of the party.
The Act under which Alexander has just
been convicted was passed in N. S. Wales in
the early ’so’s. It was copied from one of
the infamous six Acts passed in George IV. "s
reign, for the suppression of the dawning
movement in the direction of better indus-
trial conditions for working people. Amongst
other things this precious legislation made
it a criminal offence for men to combine for
the purposes of getting higher wages. A
citizen who belonged to a trades union was,
ipso facto, guilty of conspiracy. The law
which “Liberalism,” as voiced by the
Herald, hopes will not be repealed, exists
nowhere, else in the world, save in N. S.
Wales and in Queensland. It was done
away with in England as far back as 1875,
and nothing but the persistent championship
of the Legislative Council has enabled it to
survive in N.S.W. As it stands to-day, a
servant who absents himself from his em-
ployment, without what a Court conceives to
be reasonable cause, is liable to go to gaol.
If, on the “other hand, a master dismisses
his servant without reasonable cause, the
aggrieved servant has what Justice Isaacs
(in a passage which was suppressed, curi-
ously enough, by both the morning papers)
described as “the luxury of feeing a solici-
tor to bring a civil action for damages.”
The gross class bias and the heinous unfair-
ness of this legislation, which the great
“Liberal” party of Australia apparently
wants perpetuated, is apparent, when it is
understood that under it, for precisely the
same offence, while the master is liable only
to be hit in his pocket, the man stands to be
hit in his character. The worst that can
happen to the employer, if he offends, is the
loss of a (to him) trifling sum by way of
civil damages; the employee may emerge
from the fray a-convicted criminal, with all
the disabilities attaching to that state. And
the employee hasn’t even an opportunity of
appealing to a jury. He is dealt with by a
Court of Summary Jurisdiction.
Last week’s case hinged on the question
of “reasonable cause.” Had Cairnes reason-
able cause to leave his work to attend, as a
miners’ delegate, at a Union meeting? Had
the men, whose representative he was, rea-
sonable cause to cease work as a protest
against his summary discharge? Those two
questions open up a field too vast to be fully
discussed in any one newspaper article. It
is only possible to make a few of the more
glaringly obvious points in connection with
them. Under modern conditions —as. dis-
tinguished from the conditions of George
IV.’s day—two matters are accepted gener-
ally as industrial truisms, viz., (1) the vital
necessity, to the great body of workers of
Unionism; (2) the vital necessity to Union-
ism of the Union delegate. Only by first-
hand information can it be satisfactorily
established whether or no miners are work-
ing in dangerous places, or under illegal
conditions. That information it is the duty
of the delegate to acquire, and, if necessary,
act upon. So clearly has the reasonableness
of this been recognised, hitherto, by all par-
ties, that, at Newcastle, for the past 40
years, many of the Union delegates to each
lodge have been accustomed to hold their
meetings without seeking leave of absence of
anyone. And till last July the same custom
had prevailed, unquestioned, at Lithgow.
Two years ago, when one of N.S.W.’s multi-
tudinous Industrial Bills was under consid-
eration, this question of the delegates’ right
to attend meetings was raised. It was de-
cided by both employers and employees—for
fear of raising the question of jurisdiction in
a High Court appeal—to let things stand as
they were; or, in other words, it was decided
that Union delegates should meet when they
wished, unchecked, as in the past. Was it
strange, in the circumstances, that the N. S.
Wales Supreme Court (Judges Pring, Gor-
don and Ferguson) found unanimously that
the right of the miners’ delegate to attend
meetings had grown into what the lawyers
call “a custom of the industry,” and that
Cairnes, the Lithgow men’s representative,
had. therefore, reasonable cause to do what
he did? Or that Justice Isaacs should take
the same View? And if these distinguished
experts erred was the similar error of
Alexander and his mates —mere working
men—particularly flagitious or astonishing?
Yet Justice Griffith finished his judgment
in these terms :
In my opinion there was no evidence to justify the
position taken up by the men. If it had appeared on
the evidence that the respondent and his
workmen honestly believed, and had reasonable
grounds for believing, that Cairnes was wrongfully
dismissed, and that it was a term of their own con-
tract that his dismissal, if wrongful, should entitle
them to discontinue their service, the-result would
be different. For these reasons I think that the ap-
peal should be allowed.
And Justice Barton likewise expressed be-
wilderment as to what right Alexander and
the rest had to concern themselves in their
delegate’s trouble. v
■w # * *
One palpable justification of their action
lies in the fact that, if Union delegates are
liable to be discharged for attending to their
duties, Unionism, with all that it connotes
to the worker in the form of safety, decent
wages and comfort, stands an excellent
chance of being wiped off the face of the
Ma State. If a lodge meeting does not
constitute reasonable cause why one dele-
gate-should temporarily absent himself from
work, and if, for attending such a function,
he is liable to dismissal, every, other dele-
gate in the State is similarly liable'to dis-
missal. Since the delegate system is an in-
tegral part of modern unionism the desperate
position of the men, as a result of this
latest High Court effort, is painfully clear.
As the S. M. Herald remarked (25/4/T2) :
The position in Newcastle is already critical, and
this may precipitate strife.' It behoves managers to
act with extreme tact and caution. , . . In all depart-
ments of commerce there must be a certain amount
of give and take, and there is little fear that any un-
reasonable restrictions will be imposed upon delegates
as a result of this decision. \ .
Well might the Tory sheet feel agitated.
A few of the “desnotic and unreasonable
employers,” whom Justice Isaacs referred
to in his dissenting judgment, might,, by
taking advantage of the powers which it is
now established are theirs, throw the State
into a condition of anarchy. It is not well
that the peace and Wellbeing of the com-
munity should be dependent on the good be-
havior of a class which has never, been dis-
tinguished for either tact or caution where
industrial troubles were concerned. To do
awa' 1 w'fh that perilous state of affairs, the
N. S. Wales Assemblv would be wise, as
soon as mev be, to get into line with the rest
of the civilised world, and banish from the
Statute Book an enactment which never
should have got there.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “S. M. Herald” on Early Australian
History.
Last Saturday being an Australian' anni-
versary of some tonnage, certain big dailies
had a chance to expound once more the amaz-
ing ignorance which they seem bound to
display every year about this time. The
S. M. Herald, for instance, headed its lead-
ing article “Captain Cook Day,” and pro-
ceeded in this fashion
There is no memory deserving- of more honor by
Australians than that of the master voyager who first,
broke the silence of these unknown seas. Honor, and
much of it, is due also to the men who built upon
that foundation, and gave us what vve have, and
made us what we are, but it should never be for-
gotten that it was the first voyage of Cook — with its
wonderful fulfilment of the great hopes, and the wild
surmises, and the hints, and the .dreams . which for
centuries before him. had streicn the. Pacific, with ad-
venture—that made them possible, and all their
works with them. It was that voyage, too, which
gathered up all the broken threads of effort after the
great continent of the south. Through three cen-
turies the hero-navigators of that golden age of dis-
covery, when most of the world was new, and much
of it still unknown, had fought a way through


strange and perilous seas in search of it. The fame
of it had rung in many ears, and the lure of it had
heartened mariner after mariner wandering baffled
upon an endless sea. Some of them died far from
the quest. Some of them missed by the merest mis-
chance the land of treasure they sought. Cook found
it, and in doing so justified the world voyagers who,
from Magellan and Drake to Anson, tirelessly had
journeyed, hoping always for the greater discovery
bevond their lesser ones, failing always to realise
their hope. But Cook did more than merely crown
the faith of the old navigators with a triumph of
realisation. He flew the flag of England in the
great new country just when the zeal of the Dutch
and Spanish explorers had been fired to a new effort
towards the unknown shore they still believed in, and
when the French also had begun to sound the mys-
tery of the South Pacific. That is the great fame of
Cook for Britons —that it was he who, when the
secret was nearly won, and when other nations than
our own were hard upon it, plumbed it and possessed
it for England. And in that, of course, is his im-
mortal fame for ourselves, who, but for him, had not
existed. By the grace of him, therefore, Australia
and Australians have come upon the horizon of the
world as they are. Another discoverer than Cook,
and another flag, and though Australia would still be
the richly dowered land it was destined to be by
its place in the sun, another race of men had pos-
sessed It, and our part and lot in it had never been.
The most casual remembrance of what we have m
such possession of such a country should suffice tor
our homage to the memory of Captain Cook, not only
as the great and intrepid sailor who first landed on
our shores, but as the founder of our fortunes.
The Herald is supposed to be an instructor
of the people, and it is wonderfully con-
temptuous at times about what it professes
to regard as the' ignorance of Laborites ai.u
such-like. Yet apparently it doesn t know
as much about the history of its own country
as might be reasonably expected ot a tourtn-
class kid at school, and it isn’t even aware ot
its own ignorance. It was in l<pJ and if fD
that Lieutenant Cook wandered round the
shores of Maoriland and Australia. More
than 200 years earlier the Spaniards had
annexed the Philippines. The fleets of the
Dutch Governor-General of Java were break-
ing “the silence of these unknown seas as
far back as 1010, and Dutch cities were being
built almost in sight of the Australian coast.
Torres Strait was named after Torres, who
traversed it about 1007. The same year the
Gulf of Carpentaria was explored. dirk
Hartog, Van Edels, Pool, Nuijts, De
Witt, Pels art (who first described the
kangaroo), Tasman, Dampier, William de
Flamingii, and dozens more, mostly Dutch,
were around before Cook. They named the
Gulf of Carpentaria, Arnheim Land, Van
Diemen’s Gulf, Dampier Land, Dampier
Archipelago, Dirk Hartog Island, Hout-
mann’s Rocks, the Pelsart Group, Cape Leeu-
win, Nuijts’s Archipelago in the Great Aus-
tralian Bight, Tasmania (Van Diemens
Land), New Zealand, and hundreds ot other
places, though many of their names have
since been replaced by English ones. Abe
Tasman was doing battle with the. Maoris
when Cook’s grandfather was an mtant—-
possibly before that obscure agriculturist
was born. The old Dutchmen mapped the
coasts of Australia to a considerable extent,
and professed to annex it under the name ot
New Holland. They annexed Tasmania, and
made a pretence of annexing New Zealand.
But the country struck them as barren and
wretched, and their population was too small
for large schemes of colonisation; also, their
hands were full elsewhere. So, when Pel-
sart’s little armada was wrecked, they gave
up all thoughts of colonisation. Cook,
about the last of the crowd, discovered no-
thing of any great size, but he did a good
deal of work in surveying and filling m
details. And all this thrilling early history
is apparently unknown to the unspeakable
Herald. It may know a lot about old Eng-
lish kings, but apparently it never read ot
Pelsart or Tasman. In fact, it explains
quite cheerfully that, in Cook’s time (about
1770), these Dutchmen and Spaniards, who
had been leaving their names round the Aus-
tralian coast for nearly two centuries, still
believed” in the existence of Australia, and
were nearly starting to look for it. The
Herald doesn’t seem to have discovered New
Holland yet, nor Great Java, which was
the name of the country on ancient maps be-
fore it even began to be New Holland, or
Terra Australis, that it seems to have been
called in a vague sort of way before it even
became Great Java. It is marvellous that
such little knowledge should go with so much
commercial success, but possibly the Herald
caters for a class which knows even less on
some subjects than it does itself.

The story of the United States Senate s
inquiry into the loss of . the Titanic would
hp a shriek of mirth if it were not for the
tragedy that lie. behind it. , The Titanic
was a British ship. It wasn t even lost in
United States waters—m fact, it achieved
its ill-fated bump not . far from the self-gov-
erning British dominion of Newfoundland.
It didn’t so much as run into United States
ice; the ice was either a British freeze float-
ing down from the northern part ot Canada,
or? more likely, a Danish freeze from Green-
land The U.S. Senate has nothing to base
its alleged right of inquiry upon save its
amazing lack of manners, and its inability
to apnreciate the ordinary amenities of civil-
ised society. The Inquiry Board which it
has created owns for chairman a boundless
ass named Smith. Among other things
which he has desired to know were: (1)
Whether water-tight compartments were in-
tended as places of refuge for passengers;
(2) where icebergs came from; (6) wnat
icebergs were made of; (4) whether the
Titanic went down by the bows or the head ,
(5) why the s.s. California, when brought
uri bv the ice, didn’t anchor—in water

been a surprised man when he learned
that icebergs were made of ice. SI * ITI U 1S
described as a hustler, and a hustler
has been defined as a man who . is
so busy hurrying that he hasn t time
to do any work. The usual end ot
a hustler is that, after doing nothing
for six hours, he rushes into a bar or shop
with such dreadful and needless velocity to
get a cocktail or a cigar that he fatally
bruises his stomach against the counter, in
his last moments he says that overwork has
killed him. The extraordinary Smith com-
mittee has kept a large number of British
subjects—oflicers, seamen and passengers—
under a sort of arrest, though no charge as
laid against them. Bruce Ismat, of the
White Star company, has to. take this exper-
ience philosophically. He lives and has his
wealth by running steamers from England
to the United States, and if he quarrelled
with the Senate his vessels might be met
with new and disastrous regulations they
might be ordered to have new sides and hot-
toms put. in, or something of the sort. l-.he
British Government is restive, but it doesn t
know what to do. The British Government
dreads, above all things, trouble with the
United States. A war between the two
countries would promptly involve a United
States attack on Canada. 18 al LASr
defensible frontier between LOGO and oUUU
miles long between the two countries, and as
the odds against Canada would be a great
deal more than 10 to one, it is fairly certain
that that Dominion and all the hundreds ot
millions of British capital invested therein
would presently be in Uncle Sam’s hands.
Britain has no army large enough to make
any great showing in a scrimmage of that
size, and along a frontier of that length.
The British fleet could, of course, blockade
the United States’ coast, and, if it did, these
four notable results would arise: (1) The
huge British shipping companies which make
their living by carrying passengers between
Britain and the U.S. —that trade is almost
wholly British —would be more or less
ruined; (2) the Lancashire cotton industry
would be wrecked for want of U.S. cotton ;
(3) the price of the Englishman’s loaf and
beef would be greatly raised by the stoppage
of American wheat and meat supplies ; (4)
Britain would lose the handsome revenue it
derives from the American tourists who come
to England. As a fifth proposition, while a
great part of the British fleet was away
blockading the long U.S. coast, the Germans
might rush England. There could no-
thing more grotesque than the spectacle of
a country which has learned to depend
almost wholly on imported food and im-
ported raw material, driven, on a point or
honor, to blockade one of its chief sources of
supply, and thus declare war against its own
stomach. It is because of these complica-
tions that Britain puts up with the vagaries
of people like Senator Smith, and submits
to all manner of high-handed proceedings on
the part of various U.S. politicians, and tries
to cover its retreat and its discomfiture _ by
talking of the natural affection that exists
between “the two great branches of the
Anglo-Saxon race.” The Great Power which
depends almost wholly on imported food is
a new development, and the situation thus
created has no precedent in history.
The Cry of a Freetrader.
“Anglo-Australian” writes to The Bul-
letin :
Your leaderette, “The Food Taxes of Old Eng-
land” (Bulletin, 11/4/T2), leaves room for the
truth to be told in several particulars. You appear
to be flabbergasted at the amazing logic (your words)
of “L.M.’s” statement that living, including clothing,
is fully 50 per cent, cheaper in England than Aus-
tralia. Well, “L.M.’s” percentage may be a trifle
high, but anypne who can successfully prove that it
is not at any rate between 30 per cent, and 40 per
cent., would be a marvel. Now, let us have a few
facts, taking clothing first. I strongly protest against
London prices being taken from Bond or Regent
streets, which are shopping places for only the rich.
Why, even in Sydney, one can easily pay 20 or 30
per cent, too much for his clothing by going to swag-
ger shops. During my recent visit to England, 1
very carefully noted prices of wearing apparel, and
the following are some of the comparisons. In each
item I took care to see that the goods were as nearly
identical as possible. At any rate, my comparisons
are for articles purchased here and identically similar
bought in London: —
Sydney. London.
Boots .. „f'l 10 0 ~il 0 0
Straw hats .. 6 6.. 4 0 (and Sydney article
not as good.)
Collars.. .. 10 Odoz. 5 6 doz.
Shirts (colored) 6 9.. 46
Socks .. .. 30.. 23
Suits .. .. 515 0.. 4 4 0
As a matter of fact, in Chea’pside one can get a
really good suit (to order, of course) for £3 10s.,
quite equal to what the writer pays £5 15s. for in
Now," about food. You say Britain buys butter,
cheese, bacon, etc., from Australia, and “it (Britain)
buys at current local rates, for this country isn’t run-
ning any Cheap Bull Food Society or other philan-
thropic movement.” Now, dear Bulletin, your own
paper has over and over again attacked (and rightly,
too) the various rings which undeniably are in ex-
istence here, with the object of keeping up local
rates. Now, how do they work the oracle? Simply
in this way: The surplus is exported to England and
other countries, where the goods are marketed not
“at current rates” (your own expression, meaning
Australian current rates), but at import country’s
current rates. Do you know (if you don’t, you ought
to) that flour is exported to Hongkong, Straits Settle-
ments, Manila, and other countries at a price free
on board Sydney, which is often anywhere from £1
to 30s. per ton below local convention price. This is
a bard substantial fact. Under such conditions of
trading, why shouldn’t England’s prices be, at any
rate, as cheap as Australia’s? These remarks apply
to mutton, butter, beef, leather, flour, etc. Were
The Bulletin writing down the various trusts in
Australia, you would be employing the arguments I
now advance, but in an unfair attempt to prove twice
two are six, you adopt a childish process of reason-
ing, which carries with it its own disproof. Now, it
The Bulletin can truthfully declare the existence
of Trusts in England for keeping up the prices of
manufactured articles, then I’ll be prepared to admit
that the stuff exported to Australia (say, hats, boots,
collars, etc.) would be as cheap here as in England.
Anyone with experience at both ends knows such
articles are much dearer here. The Bulletin not-
withstanding, I challenge successful disproof of my
assertion that 20s. in England will piquesticinably
go as far as (say) 275. 6d. in Australia. On*: could
pull the whole of your article to pieces if one l ad
the time, but I have not time to go further into de-
tails just now.
Whether cheapness is a blessing or a curse l
another question. Unfortunately, it means, if my
statements be correct (especially ra regard
manufactures), lower wages in England And this
vou as well as I, know to be quite the case, me
cheapness being a corollary to poor wage-earning.
Space being scarce, the reply is hereby boiled
(1) The prices quoted are an absurd fake.
You can get suits to measure in Sydney at 45 s., at

worth are driven to go in an unwashed state,
and the more disastrous and frequent the
fires which rage unchecked in other less im-
portant parts, the more imbecile the selec-
tion of the dreadful Yassberra site as
the capital of all Australia, appears. The
most enthusiastic of its supporters do not
contend that the Cotter (which, till the
Sydney-organised agitation on. behali ot the
Yassberra site was begun, wasn t even rhen-
tioned in the official li§f of rivers and creeks)
is in the same class in the matter of persist-
ent dampness with either the Macquarie or
the Peel. The amazing O’Malley may fill
the atmosphere with grotesque forecasts as
to the golden future of Yassberra, and the
Sydney vested interests crowd may talk
jauntily of its splendid possibilities, but the
dreary fact remains that, handicapped as it
is, it has about as much hope of forging
ahead as a cabbage would have of prospering
on an allowance of half a pint of water per
annum. If one may judge by the experience
of every other part of N. S. Wales (with
the exception of those adjacent to the Snowy
River and similar snow-fed, and hence never-
dry, Monaro-'streams), the capital of Aus-
tralia is destined, so soon as it achieves
something of a population, to be a town
whose residents, at regular and brief inter-
vals, will be forced to go m an unwashed
state for days at a time; where gutters will
not be flushed because water, finder the in-
fluence of the good old law of supply and
demand, has become too costly; where the
drainage svstem is out of action; and where
Deople will be driven to beer by reason of
being unable to "afford the stuff you
keep in tanks. One of the best things
for Australia, in so far as Yass-
berra is concerned, will be when the
place is burned off the face of the earth,
owing to their being no water avail-
able to check the fire which started
in a small way, through the village
drunk accidentally setting light .to his
whiskers in a hayloft. The total destruc-
tion of the capital of a continent, as
a result of the absence of sufficient water
to extinguish the burning whiskers of a
drunk will be such a hideous and debasing
advt. of this country’s lack of horse sense
that its legislators may be driven, in despera-
tion, to fix on a new site, from which Aus-
tralia’s master-curse is absent.
The Deadlock War.
The comic-opera war between Abdul and
Pietbo lately took a new turn, being dead
tired of the old turn. For months the Dago
monarchy has been pouring soldiers into Tri-
poli until now there are something like
100,000 of them, costing a fearsome heap of
money, and hanging desperately on to the
sea-coast lest they should have rude things
said to them by the Turks and Arabs if they
got away from the shelter of their ships’
guns. The progress seems to be nil, and at
the present rate of movement it looks as if
10 years hence it will be nil also. The bill
isn’t nil, and 10 years hence it promises to
be hell. The idea of simply marching in-
land, finding the enemy, and belting seven
devils out of him, as the British did in
Egypt and the French in Morocco, seems
to be wholly abandoned. The Italian fleet
prevents the Turks sending reinforcements
bv sea. The obliging British person in
Egypt blocks them by land. Tripoli, with
about the population of the Italian city of
Naples, with a rusty gun, twopence in cash
and a duststorm, is reduced to playing a
lone hand. And yet the Sixth Great Power
of Europe is stuck hard and fast. So, as
already mentioned, the scrap lately took on
a new aspect. Maddened by the bill and the
laughter of Europe, an Italian squad-
ron attacked the Turkish forts on
the Dardanelles and begun to lash
around generally. It met with its
usual luck. A fleet like that which Italy
possesses, up against the utterly ramshackle
forts which Turkey possesses, should have
done something serious, but apparently the
Dago’s heart sank, and nothing much hap-
pened. And it is diflicult to guess what he
expected to happen. Even if the shelling of
some place of no importance had made the
Turk cave in and surrender Tripoli on
paper, which was plainly incredible, that
place would have to be conquered just the
same. Meanwhile, the grain ships from
Southern Russia and Roumania were
blocked for a while, for the Dardanelles
were sown with mines ; and so was the vast
miscellaneous trade of these States and Bul-
garia. Every marine nation in Europe
was wild at the futility of it all. The Turk
didn’t need to care much, as very few of the
ships which were held up were his, and he
doubtless enjoyed the spectacle of the Dago
making half Europe wild. And Austria,
which had already warned the Italian per-
son not to bring the war close to its coasts,
is said to be bursting with rage and foam-
ing at the mouth of the Danube. So, appar-
ently the Roman Government will just have
to take its footless way back to its old job
in Tripoli, where it is all loss and no gain.
It can’t collect the tithes and the land-tax
except on ruinous terms —it takes a whole
regiment to collect 3s. 6d., and artillery are
wanted if the bill amounts to ss. 9d. The
customs revenue which it might collect is
dead, because the Arab isn’t trading at pre-
sent. One of these days this Tripolitan
trouble may be mentioned in history as the
Deadlock War.
Coff’s. '
It is characteristic of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment that its brag of decentralisation in
coastal matters has got down to a reference
to the Works Committee of a scheme for
“the development of Coff’s Harbor.” Coff’s
lies far up the northern coast. The new
railway that hugs the coast will pass it, just
as the South Coast line passes Bulli, so it
may draw trade from a narrow slip of
coastal country, but no line at present ap-
proaches anywhere near it from inland to
bring down great quantities of cargo from
the wool and wheat country for shipment.
It isn’t a harbor in the large sense that Port
Stephens and Twofold Bay are. In the
days when produce was dragged to the coast
by road, and every port which was ap-
proachable by road had the same chance as
any other port, and railways were not avail-
able as a means of diverting trade to one
centre, ships used to load for Europe at both
these places; but it isn’t on record that
Coff’s ever had any ocean trade. Coghlan,
in his “Wealth and Progress of N.5.W.,”
carefully enumerated, among local ports,
Byron Bay, Shoal Bay, Trial Bay, Port
Macquarie, Forster, Port Stephens (which,
he said, “offers at all times the safest and
most commodious harbor desirable”), New-
castle, Lake Macquarie, Broken Bay, Bot-
any, Wollongong, Iviama, Ulladulla. Jervis
Bay (“on its bosom safe anchorage may be
found at any part”), Twofold Bay (“a mag-
nificent sheet of water”), and others. But
he didn’t mention Coff’s. Knibbs’s Statis-
tics, while eulogising Port Stephens and
Twofold Bay, also misses Coff’s just as he
misses the unfortunate Cotter in his great
list of N.S.W.’s rivers. It is proposed to
spend £lBO,OOO on this work to begin with,
and the Works Committee will possibly
throw out the proposition on the ground
that the advantage isn’t commensurate with
the expense. Even if it doesn’t throw the
proposition out, the decentralisation move-
ment isn’t likely to be very far advanced.
Coff’s may possibly have been selected sim-
ply to draw attention aWay from the greatly
superior places where great coastal cities
might arise if they got a chance. Great is
the art of dragging a red herring across the
scent.

Rev. J. Buchan presented the report of the public
morals committee, and moved the following motions.
“That this assembly (1) registers its serious and
emphatic protest against the continuance of prize-
Sg “ t ( S 2) Its strong dissatisfaction with the action of
the State Chief Secretary in directing the police not
to prosecute in the case of shops open for the sale
of fruit and soft drinks on Sunday. .
“(3) The assembly also records its protest against
the issuing Of permits by the Attorney-General for
lotteries, raffles and other forms of gambling, and
urges unon the Government the need of doing away
with all lotteries, without exception in favor of
churches, charities and so-called art-unions.

The Wowser went upon the prowl
Throughout his wicked city;
For Public Morals were most foul,
And with a fierce and joyful howl
He set hp a committee.
He girded on his gimlet bright—
This spear for modern quarrels
So useful to the Wowser knight—
And sallied forth unto the fight
To show up Public Morals.
So, prowling stealthily around,
Disguised in his goloshes,
Three sins most horrible he found,
Enough to anguish and astound:
The first was Lemon Squashes.
He caught some miscreants on the hop
As silently he followed.
’Twas Sunday; and he saw them s.top ;
They entered brazenly a shop,
And in bananas wallowed.
The second sin the city hid
Concerned his poor Black Brother.
The Wowser saw —and what he did
Cost that good Wowser half a quid—
Two coons that bashed each other.
But soon the Wowser found this tame
(Belief it almost baffles!),
Back to the church bazaar he came,
And found his Wowser brethren ( Shame !)
Conducting sinful Raffles!
The Wowser threw his gimlet down,
He slunk from his goloshes;
Though he had searched it up and down
There were but three sins in the town —
Prize-fighting, Raffles, Squashes!

River.
But, then, the crowd of parochial-minded
traitors who selected Yassberra meant Aus-
tralia to lose. The central idea was to
create a mean city that would never, by any
chance, overshadow the State capital where
the small parish insects flourish. Of course,
there is a fair amount of water around Yass-
berra—low-lying, slow-moving water —and
that is advertised abundantly. But water
that tumbles down from a mountain range
5000 feet above the city level is power—
almost unlimited power—and it comes to the
city by its own volition. And slow-moving
streams like the Queanbeyan river lingering
round the feet of a city are not power. In-
stead of tumbling into the premises by their
own volition, they have to be pumped up at
vast coal-expenditure if they are to be made
available at all.

Now that the Federal Postmaster-General
has got back from fooling with purely State
matters in Queensland, he may possibly find
time to shake up his own department, which
has become a trifle demented of late. On
three occasions within a few weeks, The
Bulletin has had important letters posted
to it on Monday forenoon in Melbourne, and
they haven’t been delivered in Sydney till
Wednesday afternoon. Once its telephone
was cut off for non-payment of the bill—its
upstairs telephone, it being presumably, the
top half of the bill that wasn’t paid. It was
only after application to three or four dif-
ferent officials that the right official could be
round, and he knew nothing, and had never
heard' ot any bill, and had given no instruc-
tions, and didn't know (hat anyone had given
any, and couldn’t imagine how or whv the
thmg esune about. He appeared to have
thoughts of spending a week on investiga-
tion, but the Iteligious Editor got to the
phone that was still working, and in an
earnest 10 minutes told the official every
curse he knew, except a special one that lie
kept in reserve. In about another five min-
utes communication was restored. One re-
cent week complaint was made that the
papers despatched from Sydney on Saturday
were not delivered in Melbourne till Wednes-
day. The Department has practically given
up . apologising for, or attempting to ex-
plain, these mirthful happenings. One
theory advanced is that the Government has
Ti* 0 habit of being afraid to make
suitable remarks to its uncivil or reckless
subordinates, for fear of losing their votes.
Another is that the P.M.G. has been too busv
of late defending the Queensland General
Strike. A third is that the institution has
.lust mouldy, as institutions do now
and then.
»
Angle Iron” : One of the loudest explo-
sions in connection with the tragedy of the
Titanic was that of the theory that bulk-
headed steamships cannot sink. It was the
sublime faith in this theory that made so
many of the passengers prefer to stick to
tne doomed monster rather than trust to the
lifeboats. The law requires every steamer
to b ? divided into three compartments, with
one bulkhead forward and another abaft the
engine-room. As a matter of fact, this mini-
mumis greatly exceeded, and a vessel like
the Titanic would have eight or nine trans-
verse bulkheads. Adequately bulkheaded and
r li 1 double bottom, it has always been
neld that a vessel is safe from everything
save fire. This idea might be all right if
adequately bulkheaded” carried a more gen-
erous interpretation than it does to-day. As
it stands, it has proved a staggering futility,
lhe probable cause of the sudden founder-
ing of the Titanic was that it either grazed
the iceberg or ploughed through it. In
either case, the razor ice edges would rip the
sides open and the bulkheads, warranted
to stand any shock, head on, were useless.
However, it has done this much good, that
the White Star people have given hurried
orders that the colossal new vessel, Gigantic
now. building, is to have double sides, or
longitudinal bulkheads. This will increase
the cost of construction enormously, of
course, but the White Star co. has something
else to think about just now than its build-
ing bill. In fact, it has quite a lot of things
to think about.
At a soirde held by the St. George’s Soci-
ety in Melbourne, J. M. Davies, President of
the M’s.L.C., made a magnificent defence of
the Victorian House of Rich Landlords
worthy to be quoted along with the
defences of Warren Hastings, Roger Tich-
borne and Talimmy Burns. Nobody had
thrown as much as one drop of confetti at
-the Legislative Council, or even hinted that
its members ought to take Anti-phatt, or,
Perhaps, wake up. Not a soul said the
M s.L.C. were losing their money, or were
ruthless incendiaries, or were committing all
those Toorak burglaries on their own houses.
Yet J.M.D. labored hard championing a
down-trodden Chamber without stint of
words and most prosily. Then Jack Weary
put Davies’s pot on by suavely remarking
that the speech reminded him of the verse in
Holy Writ: “And the wicked flee when no
man pursueth.” Whereat St. George’s Soci-
ety had one more macaroon and a milk-shake
each.

“Sinbad the Sailor” has arrived in Syd-
ney in a somewhat travel-worn condition, as
is often the case wi,th mariners who have
been up and down the face of the earth for
months. The dresses are not exactly as
fresh-looking as a rain-washed summer morn;
the love-making is even more perfunctory
than is customary in pantomime; and a lot
of the jesting tends to grow labored and
mechanical. In fact, if the writer had the
job of trainer at Her Majesty’s his verdict
would be that the stalble had gone a bit stale
as a result of over-Work, or too much finan-
cial • oats or something. On Monday night,
when The Bulletin viewed this show, the
choristers, usually so perfectly drilled, were
repeatedly at fault in their marchings and
counter-marchings. Presumably they had
been performing their evolutions for so long
that they had got out of the way of doing
them aright, just as the domestic mule, who
has been pacing round and round, drawing
water for years, ultimately, in a fit of absent-
mindedness, wanders off the beaten track and
down the well, and breaks his neck. Or
possibly again, there were some conscien-
tious objectors to ballet-training in the
crowd. Anyhow, the effect was not wholly
satisfactory.
“SINBAD THE SAILOR"
Comic Sailor Alders.
“Pip ” Powell as
the indispensable
dame.
Miss Florence Imeson plays principal boy,
and Miss Nell Finnis is her girl. They are
both extremely sprightly, arch, tuneful,
handsome and all the other things which
persons in their station ifi life are expected
to be. “Pip” Powell (why “Pip,” by the
way?), who sustains the wordy rOle of low-
comedy mother, is an easy, natural sort of
humorist, which is to say he gets most of his
laughs without tearing them down by main
force from the gallery. It is almost enough
to condone his asinine first name. Also there
are two “eccentric comedians,” hight Drew
and Alders, whose fooling is up to the high-
est standard. Take it for all in all, this
show resembles the N. S. Wales “Liberal”
party, inasmuch as it is notably strong on
the comic side. Charles Howard (Sinbad),
Miss Celia Ghiloni, Fred Winn and William
Hassan —who presents a life-like impersona-
tion of a bloodhound —evade the blue metal
of hostile criticism by yards ; but O. E.
Lennon’s impassioned study of a calcium-
drenched Old Man of the Sea is a good deal
too noisy and H. B. Irvingesque to be in the
cheerful, easy-going picture. The scenery
is superb. Coleman’s Persian Garden is a
vision of harmonious colors, and the big
Diamond Valley scene is brilliant enough to
please the most exacting of Hebrews—the
sort of display which is calculated to make
those who supnly the electric light go out-
side at the next interval and pour thankful
libations broadcast.
Maeterlinck has presented the philosophy
of “The Blue Bird” in the shape of a sugar-
plum. It is swallowed with enthusiasm, at
the Criterion, by the usually bored, and
bolted whole by callow fledglings who gen-
erally fight shy of moral bait. Mummy Tyl
(Maud Plunkett) and Daddy Tyl (Frederick
Reade) head and tail “The Blue Bird.' 1
They have small but exasperating parts,
which bring them on to the stage in their
night-gear, before the search for the elusive
fowl begins, and they have to turn up before
breakfast in the last act. In the interim
Mummy and Daddy have time to be con-
verted from the stage (like Ada Ward) and
get round to a Y.M.C.A. revival. At the
sign of “The Blue Bird,” G. Dickson-Ken-
win will continue to chew his barley-stick
fingers, and Water (Gladys Ellam) will drip
over Fire like a leaking garden hose, till
further notice.
*
Zigomar and Nick Carter, the detective
who was nearly 500 years old when the
“Oldest Inhabitant” was born, fought four
solid rounds at the Lyceum every night dur-
ing the first part of the week, and though
at times it appeared as though Nicholas’s
age would tell, Zigomar was, as usual, dead
at the end of the fourth round. But probably
he will be alive in time for the next film
concerning him. The picture was full of
excitement, and though at times confusing
on account of the disguises, was excellently
screened. “Shamus O’Brien,” a film sug-
gested by Samuel Lover’s Irish poem, was the
other prop of Spencer’s show; in fact,
O’Brien, Esq., was almost a pedestal. True
to the original story, the pictures were so
pathetic that at times the stalls were forced
to put up umbrellas to keep off the tears
from the gods.
** * *
Again the Adelphi management isn’t keep-
ing its word. It promised a little while
ago to give us “Brought Ruin,” but now
threatens to stage “The King’s Romance,”
concerning which the writer can do no better
than quote the London press as given in the
Sydney Telegraph :
lteally worth seeing. .. .Eloquent, and very inter-
esting .... Best of all, it gas glamor
Gas glamof seems to be a new departure on
the stage, but it’s worth chancing.
After a gilt-edged fortnight “Bonnie
Mary” will sit by her bedroom fire in her
nightie for the last time on Friday night.
She has done great business for Bert Bailey
and his partners, but the exact secret of her
success is not clear. Perhaps it is the
nightie; nay, probably it is; yea, verily
brethren it MUST have been. For the stage
nightie is mighty and will prevail, especially
when the Sydney Telegraph’s young gentle-
man remarked: “One speculates as to how
the author managed to get the play past the
censor.” That settled it. Thenceforward,
the box office was nearly swept over the rim
of things by bald-headed Methodists and
supporters of the W.C.T.U. However, book-
makers and other citizens with simple tastes
will nave an opportunity to enjoy themselves
at the Palace during the next two weeks,
which will be given to a production of
“Steele Rudd’s” Australian story, “On Our
Selection.” The first performance is sche-
duled for Saturday night.
* * sjc #
• Wirths’ Circus, which is still lashing its
480 variegated tails at Belmore Markets,
Sydney, has made extensive alterations and
additions to ihe programme, and is,' bidding
in a spirited fashion for a second booking-
office invasion. On Saturday next, it is ad-
vertised, the sum of £5O will be available for
the man who can bridle, saddle and ride the
outlaw “Lightning” in 15 minutes. The
Religious Editor has decided not to compete.
** * *
Burnetti, a musician who changes his
clothes wLh astonishing rapidity, arrived at
Sydney Tivoli on Saturday, and scored quite
a lot of applause. It would never occur to
a painter to bid for approval by swiftly
changing his boots 1 ; nor would any writer
think of winning popularity by making as-
tonishing leaps from one desk to another.
But, seemingly, things are different in the
theatrical world. After Bufnetti come the
Casselli Sisters, of whom no more need be
said than that their legs are shapely. Hay-
man and Franklin, Hebraic humorists, Tiny
Arnold, and Tom Dawson, are the other chief
assets of the bill.

' The Blascheck-WrightOn entertainers
finish up their season at Sydney Y.M.C.A.
Hall, on Saturday evening, after which the

silence and unlighted factories.

“The House of Temperley” is falling, at
Sydney Royal, as this Bulletin hurries
through the presses. The approaching clatter
of the “Ben Hur” chariot is heard in the dis-
tance, and the smell of the specially-im-
ported camel—which has been thinking deeply
at Sydney Zoo ever since the original pro-
duction was obliterated by fire—grows
stronger in the nostrils of the city. On
Saturday night, both sensations will con-
front the first nighter.
* * *
Providing the heavens don’t fall in ad-
vance, Ada Ward is going to fill Sydney Town
Hall just once on Saturday night with a
grief-stricken show, which is to be partly
personal explanation and partly gloomy
items of the noble and soul-inflating varietv.
After explaining herself (“giving startling
instances of her treatment, supported by
names”), Ada will become Lady Isabel in
“East Lynne,” and wring the bosoms of all
present in the Little Willie death-bed scene.
After that, she will distribute cold shudders
in the curse scene from “Leah the For-
saken.” More furtive eye-dampness will be
caused by the recitations, “Not Understood”
and “The Little Hero”; while the great
organ will sigh and moan and grumble over
all like an elephant suffering from religious
doubts. The advertisement of the function
winds up thusly: “YOU CAN SEE OTHER
ENTERTAINMENTS AT ANY TIME.
YOU CAN SEE MISS WARD ONLY
ONCE.” So it is not to be repeated. In
which respect it is like the Burning of Rome
and other staggering historic turns.
* * =;= *
The Four Amaranths, who are making
their first Australian appearance at Ade-
laide Tivoli, are strenuous, not to say
panther like, and attractive young women.
They stand on one foot apiece, with the other
hoisted on the shoulder and pointing skyward.
y\ earing the irreducible minimum of cloth-
ing, they form human nvramids and fall
asunder; everything at express speed, except
when, for a second, at the sound of a crash-
es chord, they pose statue-like. It is an
electrifying turn. Terry and Lambert are
as satisfying as before. The audacity of
che male partner in sandwiching a pathetic
recitation between two bits of pure foolerv
demands notice. He finds it difficult to get
the house to take it seriously. At the King's
are a well-balanced selection, including
Datas, who knows just when everything hap-
pened, and the “King’s College Boys,” a
team of human nightingales. This house has
the wise plan of lowering prices slightly everv
evening but Saturdnv, on which night Ade-
laide goes amusement-mad. West’s. Em-
pire, Wondergraph (all strong picture pro-
grammes, and there are others still)are all
literally Full Houses. The Royal has been
having a most unusual vacation, exempt that
on two evenings Robyns and other local ex-
perts sang Omar exquisitely (Lehmann’s
‘Persian Garden”). Now Maggie Moore
has come in with “Bridget MeSweeney.” It
is not a great play, but poor Spencer’s hero-
ine fits M.M.’s jovial personality to per-
fection.
In “T. Atkins,” the reverend hero (by
the way, a parson is the hero of two bel-
lowdramas in Melbourne at present) wins
the approval of the “nuts” early in the first
act, when lie bestows a benediction upon
Beer, and confesses that he eats a little
himself, in strict moderation. When he
leaves the Church, for reasons not unlike
those advanced by Ada Ward, the general
opinion is that the anti-Beelzebub profession
has lost one of its noblest sons. Walter
Baker, whether scrapping the good scrap
upon behalf of the Lord or in the cause of
Bull, is always picturesque; but, because of
his habit of allowing his emotion to go to
his legs, his hero often suggests a cove in the
early stages of intoxication. Miss Frances
Ross, as the worried heroine, never forgets
to look sad, and the villain of Laurence Har-
dinge displays the animated qualities of a
pound of lead. The debilitating effects of the
comic relief are somewhat mitigated by Miss
Vera Ramee, whose bright acting as Kate
Perkins, together with the complete lack of
unanimity which characterised a job lot of
supers, added to the gaiety of the first night
performance.

On Saturday last at the Melbourne Opera
House this paper made the acquaintance of
“TOMMY ATKINS.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Harold Wilson is a parson who is noble,
true and kind,
But offends the Naicest People with his dem-
ocratic ways ;
So he chucks his job in anger, and we subse-
quently find
He has joined the British army, as a private.
(Loud hoorays!)
Soon the reg-i-ment is ordered to forsake ole
Hingland’s strand—
Far away in distant Egypt there’s some
scrapping going on;
In the next act there we find them, with the
villain in command
Quite determined to surrender and haul down
the Union John !
But bold Harold dashes forward, and he
waves his sword on high—
’Tis rank mutiny, but ev’ryone condones the
martial crime—
“ Come on, blokes,” he yells (or words to that
effect), “we’ll do or die!” —
They’d most likely do the latter, but relief
arrives in time.
Sweet Ruth Raymond is a maiden purer
than the driven snow.
But she weds the wicked villain, for some
reason not too clear.
Lo! she finds that he was married in the
not-so-long-ago,
And his missus still is living! Ruth is
broken up, pore dear!
Then her troubles are augmented by the
coming of the cheeild,
And the village females will not speak to her,
at any cost;
And her stern, religious parent casts her off,
in accents wild !
Thus she’s made to realise that she is Most
Completely Lost!
Things might certainly be better, though
they could not be much worse,
For Miss Raymond, who determines she will
leave Bull’s chilly shore;
So she treks to distant Egypt, as a noble
army nurse,
And out there she meets brave Harold, whom
she’d known in days of yore.
After this all is plain sailing, and you'll
not be at a loss
In imagining the ending, when you know,
’mong other things,
That the hero’s Walter Baker and the lady
Frances Ross,
And the drama “Tommy Atkins,” and the
venue Melbourne King’s.
VICTOKIA.

week. It will shortly become a permanent
lodger at the new Flinders-street Scala
Theatre, which is now mounting to the wel-
kin in layer upon layer of bricks and mortar.
Meanwhile, a little language can be spilt
on' Saturday’s programme. Among the
Kinemacolors the chief matter of interest
was the film of ladies who ran in the final
of the Beauty Stakes. In black and white
the most eminent circumstance was “Lead,
Kindly Light,” a yarn showing the effect of
hymn tunes on ladies of undecided virtue.
** * *
A repast of consternating comedy and dis-
hevelled drama was furnished by Spencer, at
Melbourne Olympia, on Saturday. High on
the pinnacle of the menu was “Billy’s Strata-
gem,” a tale in which the nearly extinct Red
Indian howled with the frenzy of, other days.
A gunpowder, explosion, arranged by Billy,
was.the feature of the item, and, when the
smoke was dissipated on the screen, Billy’s
enemies were scattered around the blue halls
of the sky. Another bellicose marvel, “The
Indian Massacre,” was so blud-sdaked and
savage that the dreadful “Battle of Potts-
burg Bridge” seemed a timid Baptist tea-
meeting in comparison. In contrast to those
sanguinary doings appeared the trim. prim,
circumspect landscape of the Me. of Man, the
atom of dirt that became a continent in the
haunting yarns of ’All Caine.
This week’s Chief Lures at the National
Amphitheatre are Laurence Barclay, Jack
Straw and Percy Clifton. Comedians all,
and songsters of some note. As a means of
attracting Brither Wowser, who has
hitherto, for some inexplicable reason, shown
a disposition to shun this place of enter-
tainment, a scantily-clothed Australian
Venus has been provided. The effect is said
to have been magical, Gimlet-experts, in and
out of disguise, being now observable any
night all over the auditorium.

“The Girl in the Train,” at Melbourne
Her Majesty’s, has not yet encountered seri-
ous mishap. During last week Talleur An-
drews sprained his ankle, and, for one night,
his place had to be taken by understudy
Outtrim, but, at time of writing, the merry
Andrews was back in the cast, pursuing the
even baritone of his way. The divorce
court scene, in the first act of “The Girl,”
although it falls far short of its Gilbertian
model,, is fairly amusing in its way, and
would be more so if Judge Percy realised
the possibilities of his part, instead of merely
indicating them.

This paper is moved to speak with a fair
measure of respect of "The Night Side of
Uondon,” now being revealed at the Prin-
cess’s, because of ihe managerial erudition
displayed in the programme, which ob-
serves : "There is a dreadful evil in our
midst, and this Play is written with the
object of trying to wipe it out. Iloni Soit
Qui Marl-y-pense.” The drama shows how
innocent rural maids, who might develop
into highly etlicienc milkers, are enticed to
Fogtown by a wicked Hebrew, who offers to
teach them typewriting out of pure benevo-
lence. The typists are hired out to men
who are either loose or tight, or both, and
sometimes they return wi h their back hair
down and their virtue intact, but more often
they remain with their hair in order and
their moral health seriously impaired. These
last settle down to a life of mournful gaiety,
and assist at uninspired orgies at a naughty
night club, the walls whereof are decorated
with pictures of cherubim and seraphim.
The most moving scene in the play is when
the evangelist hero is enticed to the upstairs
bedroom of one of the Flossie ladies. His
horrified Wowser disciples, having been, fore-
warned of his presence there by Herod the
Awful One, come rushing in through a
French window, although the means by
which lliey reach the second storey from the
street below are not apparent. Seeing that
the police rush in by the ordinary door en-
trance, and drive the holy rabble back, the
assumption is that the rabble are hurled off
the balcony and left to die of concussion on
ihe tram line. Or it may be that the same
Providence which watched over Herod when
Cross hurled him from the same balcony,
also takes measures to temper the fall to the
violently ejected multitude. One could
spend hours in speculating on the various
possibilities of curtain tableaux in a stirring
Marlowdrama.

Verein Hall, and an artistically designed pro-
gramme (which is a silent reproof to the
horribly commercial bills of imported plays
produced by old-established managements)
promises an interesting show on Wednesday
the 15th.
** * *
Alexander Watson comes due at the Mel-
bourne Athenaeum Hall next Saturday (4th).
Watson is the Locke Richardson of these
times, who recites from memory Shaks-
peare playd and Dickens novels, and brings
the atmosphere of theatrical illusion to the
platform where he performs on his own. He
is described as a master of rhetoric, and a
man with a fine sense of humor, which alleged
endowments will be fully tested in his first en-
tertainment. The Alexander Watson series of
“platform plays” starts with “Twelfth
Night.” On Monday night comes “Macbeth.”
Dickens’s “Carol,” “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream,” “Nicholas Nickleby,” etc., happen
later in the week.
THE RUDIMENTS OF HIS ANT.
There have been many comment in regard to the
United Stales Senate committee's haphazard methods
and the chairman's nautical, ignorance.
The chairman asked one witness if the Titanic
“sank by the bows or by the head”? (Loud laughter.)
lip asked Mr. Lowe, the fifth officer of the Titanic,
where the icebergs came from.
Mr. Lowe: The Arctic regions.
The chairman: What arc they composed ofv
Mr. Lowe: Ice. — Cablegram-.
NAUTIGAL INSTRUCTOR (to future chairman,
who should know a LITTLE of such things):
"Now, Coluinbus, tell me whore the A retie
regions live! ”
SENATOR COLUMINIS: "Phase, sir , in the
refrigerator!"
The caliphs, dancing girls, sheiks and
houris of “Kismet” continue their gradual
progress at Melbourne Royal, to an accom-
paniment of pom-poms and the jingle of coin
flowing into the coffers of the combine. The
play contains some of the elements both of
pantomime and of bellowdrammer. A music-
hall touch is introduced when Hajj displays
his alleged skill as a conjurer before the
Caliph, and, in the harem scene, a beauty
show is provided by way of a side issue.
The flapper who takes a plunge bath in full
view of the audience is still in a charmingly
uncensored condition, and some sinners who,
having heard of the sleepless nights the
damsel caused Bull's . theatrical Cliadband.
were expecting something of a sultry nature
are now wondering what all the fuss was
about, anyhow.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The Bulletin’s Spasmodic Correspondent sends
reminiscences of the Bard: Shakspeare’s birthday.
Overhaul his Australian stage history. The following
never acted to my knowledge: “Titus Andronicus,”
“Pericles,” “All’s Well that Ends Well,” “Troilus
anil Cressida,” “Henry 1V.,” Second Part, or any
of the three parts of “Henry VI.” “Timon of
Athens” was acted in Sydney. “Two Gentlemen of
Verona,” “Love’s Labor Lost,” “Measure for Meas-
ure,” “Cymbeline,” and “Winter’s Tale” were all
produced with Brooke. “Taming of the Shrew,” by
Brooke and Sullivan - ; “Julius Csesar,” by Sullivan,
and I think by Brooke; “Antony and Cleopatra,” by
Miln. Best Hamlets: Sullivan, Adams, Montgomery,
Best Richard 111., Sullivan, though Miln was good.
The only Henry V., Rignold (but Brooke acted it).
Best King Lear, W. E. Sheridan. Brooke outshone all
in Othello, but, perhaps, Rignold came next. Either
him or Asche. Best lagos: Brooke, Sullivan, Diver.
Best Juliet: Probably Mrs. Scott Siddons. Best Rosa-
linds: Nora Kerin, Essie Jenyns, or Mrs. Heir.
“Twelfth Night” was produced by Coppin, by Miss
Waldorf, and by Musgrove. “Midsummer Night’s
Dream,” by Jefferson, Rignold and Musgrove. Sulli-
van was the best Benedick in “Much Ado About No-
thing.” I thought my accomplished friend Titheradge
rather too much like Don Quixote in it. “Comedy
of Errors,” produced by Brooke and the Holloways.
Best Shy lock: Sullivan or Asche. King John acted
by Brooke, Sullivan and Montgomery. Wolsey by
Brooke, C. Kean and Creswick, Coriolanus, by
Brooke and Anderson. Macbeth, by Brooke, Sullivan,
Kingston, Bentley, etc. “Merry Wives of Windsor,”
produced by Sullivan, Rignold and Asche. “Richard
the Second,” acted by C. Kean. “The Tempest,” pro-
duced by Brooke and Rignold. And so ends my cate-
chism.
“N.”: Policeman Fennessy’s statement that Caleb
Porter “said he was a gentleman, but I found he was
an actor,” recalls the statement of Mrs. Grundy’s
new servant: “My name’s Shakspeare, mum, but no
relation to the piay-hactor of that name, mum.”
“Harrison 0.”: A striking example of the imme-
morial futility of the parson crops up in “The Night
Side of London,” the latest Marlowdrama at Mel-
bourne Princess’s. Two beggars, one blind and the
other dumb, meet the snatcher of brands from the
burning, and the blind one recounts their strange,
eventful history. The villain of the piece had some
years ago stolen his (the mendicant’s) 'missus, and
put out his (the alms seeker’s) eyes; while in his
snare time the miscreant had also seduced his pal’s
sister and cut out the pal’s tongue. The two ate now
seeking for the bloke who has treated them so de-
spitefully, and announce their intention of disgorging
lethal stoush when they find, him. “Ah, no!” mur-
murs the reverend hero in a voice that resembles re-
fined molasses poured through a muslin strainer, “you
must forgive and forget.”
The death of E. T. Steyne, the other day, was an-
other instance of the futility of the theatrical person
tripping from England to Melbourne on business for
the benefit of his lungs. A theatre in any part of
Australia is a very unsuitable workshop for a con-
sumptive person, and in Melbourne it gives him no
chance. E. T. Steyne had been advised to go to Aus-
tralia to save his life, so lie thought himself lucky,
no doubt, in getting an engagement as panto, “pro-
ducer” from the Combine. The panto, kept him busy
in Melbourne for a good many weeks ; and long before
the production had ceased to run, the consumption of
poor Steyne had begun to gallop, so the performance
which was originally advertised for his benefit, be-
came a benefit in aid of his widow and children. At
Her Majesty’s he was known as one of the mildest
mannered producers that ever cut a speech or re-
proved a chorus girl. Mummers will be disposed to
feed their proverbial superstition with the idea that
“Sinbad” is an unlucky panto., seeing that producer
Steyne and leading man Lincoln have both gone with-
in the first four months.
The peremptory “Move on, please” of a Melbourne
city policeman was under discussion in the local
police court last week, Caleb Porter, of the Oscar
Asche Co., being defendant in the case. Caleb’s atti-
tude towards the officer of the law had been some-
what contemptuously English,- it seemed, and a fine of
one sovereign was not more than enough to charge
him for the advertisement he had courted. The
trouble in this case, as in most others of the kind,
arose not from the fact that the defendant was stand-
ing on the footpath .when complainant told him_ to
move, but from their mutual tendency to tin-godish-
ness. Neither of them made the least concession to
the other’s sense of self-importance, or, saw anything
humorous in his own. Caleb Porter, whom Australia
remembers aS its first Imperial Nero in “Sign of the
Cross,” told the magistrate -“it Was the incivility of
the constable that stopped me from moving away at
once. He was not polite. I did not like to slink off
like a wounded dog.” /And the awful dignity of the
' policeman voiced itself in the impassioned query -
“Didn’t he insult me by his tbok in front of all those
people?” When an outraged hactor bumps up agauist
a policeman’s notion of what is due to him in a pub-
lic place, the penalty is rarely less than. £1 sterling.
Incidental to this Vanity Fair episode, however, Mel-
bourse is wanting to kn<>w for the 999th time why
the same “Move on” clause, which is Persistently en-
forced against harmless citizens' in its Block uis-
trict, is never brought to bear on the ugly loiterers
who congregate in Bourke-street. Bookmakers, thieves,
touts and dead-beats are never charged with obstruct-
ing the footpath. Possibly they would look insult-
ingly at a constable who accosted them as strangers,
but being particularly well known to the police, they
stand in no danger of ' getting their feelings hurt.
“0.K.”: Melbourne Age said of the local Marlow-
drama ■ “The lesson of a new version of the oft-dis-
cussed Maiden Tribute to Modern Babylon is cer-
tainlv taught without vulgarity and coarseness.”
Which is certainly true. The maidens are demurely
employed as workers at a type-writing emporium,
where'the profligate tributeers come and arrange terms
of hire with the manager—a man of unblem-
ished frock-coat and bell-topper—in his private study.
The audience is witness to one transaction in which
the tributeer pays £lOO to have a maiden sent to
his office, and doesn’t ask for a guarantee of her com-
plaisance. The “white slave traffic" is marked by an
air of unnatural refinement.
“L.”: The instinct
of the Cow Slave,
which inspires the de-
votee to sacrifice, his
children before the ud-
ders of Strawberry and
Duchess of Derrimut
52 A, is strong in the
theatrical person also.
As the cow-worshipper

deputation of mimes and
mummers, calling itself
satirically the Stage
Children's Defence Asso-
ciation, went last week to
■Cornstalk Minister Car-
michael, praying his per-
mission to get stage work
out of children even nearer
to babyhood than at pre-
sent. They wept to think
that the comparative sen-
ility of 14 years had to
be reached before the pal-
lid kid could be paid to
drag her weary feet in the
juvenile ballet, or stifle
her yawns to quaver shrill
applause to the Tin Can
Band. These infant prodi-
gies, they maintained,
stale so speedily that
“stage education must be
commenced at a very early
age,” 14 years being un-
thinkably old for this
purpose. The Minister re-
fused to alter the law, for
which refusal he is here-
by rewarded with a cheer
that blows the roof off.
Already the law has been
far too much relaxed.

diseased craving to see the
very young on the stage is a curse. The spectacle
which lures from foolish women in the audience
gasping remarks like, “Oh, how pretty !”—that is to
say, the spectacle of a dozen or so forlorn little nip-
pers singing a chorus to amuse adults somewhere be-
tween 10 o’clock and midnight—is altogether dismal
and pitifully sad. Of the parents of these unfortu-
nates, some are only greedy, exploiting their little
ones like the Gow Fiend previously mentioned. Some
are afflicted with that most contemptible of vanities,
stage-mania; and it is strong enough to make them
immolate their own children. A few, perhaps, are so
poor that the kids have to earn the money which the
adults cannot. The work in the theatre, with night
after night of unhealthy hours, is ruinous to the
youngsters ; and this writer (for one) never goes away
from a “juvenile” interlude in an adult play with-
out feeling sick with sorrow and disgust. The fact
that the sleek and prosperous women in the audience,
looking as if they might be mothers of infants, can
applaud and admire this pathetic child-slavery, is to
him an absolute proof of the shallowness of feminine
sympathy.

There’s a lady named Bernhardt —an actress,
I sat at her feet as a boy ;
Oh, I deemed her the world’s benefactress,
Her Art was a wonder—a joy !
Though more years than I care here to mention
Have flown —how ungallant are facts !
The “divine” one still claims my attention,
For Sarah still acts!
When the time comes to ring down the curtain
On my little comedy show,
I’ll answer the call, feeling certain
That my idol of —how long ago?—
Will still as Camille be appearing

And I’ll hear in—wherever I’m steering-
That Sarah still acts!

A Aickergraph impression of the Divine Sarah
(Bernhardt) torn between love and phthisis.
One of the most heartfelt prayers ever
uttered was that of Whitely, a steward on
the Titanic. He was flopping in the cold,
wet sea, when he saw a raft holding 31 men.
They pushed him away, telling him it was
31 lives against his. “I prayed,” says
Whitely, “that someone on the raft might
die. so that I might take his place. And
someone did die, and I was allowed aboard.”
Are the parsons not going to quote this yarn
as an example of the efficacy of prayer? 'The
yarn recalls an interview the writer once got
after a punt had capsized in the Saltwater
River (Vic.) and drowned a few persons.
This man was a survivor. He related that
while he hung to the overturned craft, he
felt somebody clawing at his legs under
water. “But,” he said with pride, “I kicked
as hard as I could with both feet, and the
fellow let go.” A kick is as good as a
prayer in this struggle for existence.
“M. Safran” writes :
A falsity which • always annoys me is that which
represents Britons as possessing, in a peculiar de-
gree, the faculty of worthily meeting sudden and
violent death. It is an offshoot of the old absurdity
that “one jolly Briton” was a match for three for-
eigners. The last words of the skipper of the Titanic
to the doomed folks around him are said to have
been, “Be British.” He might as apropriately
have requested them to be German or American, or
even, I regret to say, Japanese. The men of these
races have met dreadful deaths at sea and elsewhere
as stolidly as any Britons. One of the finest perform-
ances on the Titanic in the heroism line was put up
by an elderly German Jew, a millionaire, and one
who in his time has been roundly reprobated for his
business methods, by the press of his adopted Jand.
According to Reuter:- —
“James Etches, a steward, assisted Mr. Benjamin
Guggenheim, the millionaire, and his secretary, to
put on lifebelts and sweaters. He afterwards found
them in evening dress, helping the women.
“Mr. Guggenheim said, ‘We will go down like
gentlemen. Tell my wife I tried to do my duty.’ ”
In the ordinary course of things it is improbable
that Guggenheim would have voluntarily risked his
life for a number of strange women. Who, for ex-
ample, ever heard of a Guggenheim imperilling his
health by removing his fur coat and wrapping it
round some ill-clad female derelict of the parks?
What ambition has his type, ordinarily, to shine as
a “gentleman”—the sort of futile citizen who is
never a millionaire unless by inheritance, and who
regards the glorious game of shekel-hunting as a
thing to be shunned, unless and until one is kicked
into it by the relentless hoof of Necessity. The fact
is that in moments of almost hopeless peril, men,
and women too, of the white race often become ex-
alted, as it were. The supreme horror of the moment
seems to revolutionise their characters. The meanest
souls are found behaving superbly. (As a side-line,
men of character and reputed courage often break
down. It is notorious, for example, that the two
who showed the white feather most clearly, when
the China was wrecked, were highly-esteemed clerics.)
On something the same principle the navvy, whose
legs have been severed by a passing train, sits, the
calmest person present, and gives directions, etc., as
to how the news is to be broken to his wife, before
they bring him to the hospital to die. That is not
the navvy of everyday life, any more than the elderly
Jew who died so splendidly the other day represents
the Yid plutocrat in his normal state.
* * * *
“Locust” writes: —
Some of the British papers which went into spasms of
sympathy with the terrible loss of millionaires in
the Titanic disaster, have persecuted for years men
like Havelock Wilson, M.P., because he tried to have
the lives of sailors as well as passengers conserved
by a stringent law, proper supervision and severe
punishments of tli'ose who neglected the law. For a
similar humane attempt in Australia to save sailors
from “coffin ships,” The Bulletin was nut to great
expense and trouble fighting the Atacama case. After
we have exhausted our sympathy with the drowned
millionaires we ought to look homewards at the
supervision exercised over our liners, coastal and har-
bor ferry boats. These should be publicly reported
upon periodically. I have been round the world five
times, and though I have often seen “fire and boat
drills” at sea, I have never seen a boat actually
launched, save once in the Mediterranean, when a
seaman fell overboard from a liner, and owing to
rusty blocks and insufficient skill and practice in the
men who handled the job, the man was drowned be-
fore we could get to him.
From The Bulletin’s frequently-wrecked
contributor: —
The people who complain that the accounts of the
smashing of the Titanic and the subsequent happen-
ings are incoherent and contradictory are merely
advertising that they lack imagination, are one-eyed,
and have no proper comprehension of things. There
can be no coherent account of the wreck of the great
liner. It was a score or a hundred wrecks bound
up in one volume. The conditions were not only
different on each deck, but at different ends of
each deck, and on the opposite sides of each deck.
A ship nearly 1000 ft. long had rushed against an ice
floe 100 miles long and 35 miles wide. It sug-
gested the illimitable colliding with the inevitable,
or Space, travelling at full speed, bumping into
Time. It was a wrecked city, a sinking town. And
just as in a wrecked city the happenings in different
streets would vary, so they did on the different decks,
and on different sections of the same decks. There
might be peace and liquor and cigars and profound
confidence here, and blank despair over there. At
the stem there may have been, and seems to have
been, a lack of boat accommodation. Amidships
boats were being sent off only half full, and no one
had time to take a train to the stem and investi-
gate. The people in the parts of the ship remote
from the area of injury still believed the lying ad-
vertisement which said the Titanic was unsinkable.
And, probably, it was unsinkable had it struck any-
thing else than a principality of ice. People who
had read up shipwrecks knew all about the occa-
sions on which every soul who took to the boats
was lost, while those who stayed on the alleged
foundered ruin lived long years to marry, and bury,
and divorce, and go bankrupt, and get into gaol, and
wish they had taken to the boats. So there is
nothing startling about the story that hundreds
refused to quit, and tried to persaude friends not
to quit. There was no general alarm sounded. The
captain and officers didn’t seize the situation with
both hands and order a complete evacuation. Things
were casual. The writer has had the misfortune to
come through two wrecks, and still be toiling for a
crust when, had he taken to the boats, he would
have been flying in Heaven. In every great ship-
wreck the question is, “To Go, or Not To Go.” A
boat is a flimsy-looking thing, and people shrink
from leaving a ship that they cannot actually feel
sinking, knowing that to stay may be safety, and to
go may be slush. It looks like leaving a cathedral
and taking refuge on a chip. And then, when it
became obvious the liner was going under, the boats
were out of reach, and would not return for fear of
being swamped. The cruellest part of the business
was that, only 20 miles away, was a steamer large
enough to saved every soul, and fitted with wireless,
too. But the message for help was unheard because
the operator had gone to bed. For the best part of
an hour that young man was a much more important
person than his salary might imply, and 1600 lives
depended upon his lying down and rising up. He
didn’t rise ; and the i6OO drowned. So apparently it
is not enough to install wireless; to make it effective
it is necessary that an operator should be on duty
all the time. It was only by chance that the Car-
pathia received the message, as the operator was
just in the act of leaving the office when the distress
signal came wandering through space. So had the

EVA: “Yes. And the worst of it is he wants me to return his ring , and I've forgotten
which of them is his."
Olympic and Carpathia operators both been in bed,
as it seems they would have been a few minutes
later, the loss of the largest ship in the world
would probably have been one of the mysterious
disappearances, for it is highly improbable that
the boats, short manned as they were by skilled
sailors, would ever have reached land.
“Wireless” isn’t an unmixed blessing after
all. Already it is complained that the ship
is navigated from the office by somebody sit-
ting on a stool, and that the captain, who
should be responsible, is degenerating into'
a sort of message boy in brass buttons.
In the Atlantic the wireless call word
seems to be “Shut up!” and the ring-off
signal is “Clear out!”

“Trotter’!': There has just been a fire at
the Dublin Four Courts, which are on the
site of a Dominican Monastery, confiscated
by Henry VIII. A remark
in a poem by Burns about
the Devil being in Dublin
puzzles nearly all readers.
It refers to a wooden statue
of Satan. The Law Courts
were held, till 1796, in a.
building within the pre-
cincts of Christ Church
Cathedral. The main hall,
an octagon, was approached’
by a lane with lawyers’
offices on both sides. At
the entrance to this was the
statue of the Devil. The
head and (he horns were
impounded by some antiq-
uary. The rest was
knocked up into snuff-boxes
and other mementoes,
eagerly sought after. The
lane was officially named
Christ Church Alley, but
had the popular name of Hell, which be-
came no more offensive than Jesus College
which, in an English University, is com-
monly known as “Jaggers.”
“Eddyson” deliberately prods the Ant-
heap
Why has the Wowser no moan of pain to direct at
the holiday camper? By his strange silence in this
regard he is neglecting a magnifice'ht field for mis-
sionary enterprise, and overlooking noble opportuni-
ties of casting the first stoneheap. Whenever an opening
offers, numerous batches of campers of both sexes hasten
from Melbourne into adjacent wildernesses—-any old
wilderness will do, seaside, or hill, or hollow—and
there pitch tents, and live the simple, primitive life,
till driven back to shop, factory and office by the
effluxion of time. Of late years there have been ex-
traordinary developments in this sane and sanitary
habit. It contains all the elements calculated to
provoke a virulent outbreak of Wowseritis. For the
Wowser does not ask proofs of Sin ; it is only neces-
sary for him to descry available opportunities. Nat-
urally these are numerous in camp, especially when,
as during the Easter festival, the wild winds of night
whip tents from their moorings and induce
a headlong rush of underclothed campers of
both sexes over the hills and far away in
quest of flying roofs and stampeding gar-
ments. In one Easter Monday instance, near War-
burton, nine girls, in damp white nighties, had to
ambuscade in a stockade of bark sheets held up from
within for seven hours, while the ma|es gathered
tents and bedding, and made a colleetfctn of clothes
over miles of primeval bush. Possibly, now that 1
have drawn his attention to the matter, Wowse will
find another reason why the young of man should be
kept in crates.

HER GREATNESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Britain’s greatness is coal. —English paper, raving
about the coal strike.
Her Greatness is Coal !
Not yeomen who battle as men did of yore
With bill and with blade,
When foes would invade;
Not patriots who’d lay down their lives for her shore ;
Not sailor boys true
Who’d sweep o’er the blue
And make the proud flagship of rivals their goal—
Her Greatness is Coal!
Her Greatness is Coal!
Not deep-bpsomed women and broad-shouldered men,
Not sinew and thew
Of her toilers who do;
Not Genius who flashes the light from his pen ;
Not subtlest inventor,
Not mighty-browed Mentor,
Not Heav’n-inspired thinker who mints ns his soul—
Her Greatness is Coal!
Her Greatness is Coal!
One time ’twas her Shakspeare, her Newton, her
jßyron,
Her Hastings, her Clive,
Her Vikings who’d rive
An Empire of Gold from a Hades of iron ;
Her soldiers who drave
With musket and glaive
Till-they held half the earth and wanted the whole.
, But now it is Coal.
Her Greatness is Coal!
Is the day then no more, when her fighters broad-
chested,
Her deep-throated seamen,
Her fearless-eyed freemen,
Her maidens so stately, her matrons full-breasted,

Winter lends itself to a hat of this character. It
is adaptable to different faces and physiques. The
quality of fur is such as will stand sudden
showers as well as sunshine. As the life of a hat
ends with its loss of shape, the stability of this hat
stamps it at once as a good investment. It is
Alpine in shape, with turned-over brim, 2J inches
wide, adjustable to any angle at sides, back or front,
Its body is a Soft Fur Felt, with 2in. contrasting
bands in Slate, Mouse or Mid-Green.

The Vic. Board of Health Is con sidering
whether it will have.'the' Railway Commis-
sioners gaoled or 'fjned or whether it will
just administer a caution. The matter con-
cerns certain of which were con-
signed, in an open truck, from Melbourne to
Ballarat in February last! On arrival at
Millbrook, a few miles out. So were found
to be deceased, but nobody -noticed anything
untoward about the circumstance,' and tin*
consignment went on. It reached Ballarat
later, very much later, wpen more sheep were
found to.be dead. There the truck remained
in the station yard for a day— a hot day, by
the imight have continued so for a
further space, but that a. police constable
had his attention drawn to it —by the wind
—and investigated. A brief examination
sent him chasing after the local Health
Officer, who promptly ordered the whole
cargo to be buried before it escaped, it being
obviohsly too far gone even for boiling-down
purposes.. The' John was a man of sense,
and, besides reporting the matter to his
superiors, he -suggested that the Board of
Health be asked to howl like seven devils at
the railway bosses. Those gentlemen have
explained that (1) the sheep were old and
poor; (2) that the Millbrook station-master
sent the consignment on as for boiling-down
purposes; (3) (hat the department has no
regulation dealing with the case; and (4)
that the train was Considerably delayed
owing to exceptional circumstances. It is
also stated that one station-master observed
that some of the sheep weren’t quite dead,
and requested a man to kill them, but that
he was too busy or too forgetful to do so.
It is a quaint episode.
Last week the Sydney charmer who per-
sists in skewering her hat on to her thatch
with something that looks more like a cav-
alry lance than anything else on earth, got
part of the shock she deserved. Four of her

were haled before the common police court
to answer charges of having endangered the
public sight and beauty, a,nd contrary to .ex-
pectation not one of the four ,put up a fight.
They, pleaded guilty, and threw themselves
with a crash on the mercy of the Court. The
City Council was in a forgiving mood, and
intimated that-it did not press for a heavy
penalty. It merely wanted to impress upon
woman that the dominant sex was in earnest.
So the Court handed out ss. and 6s. costs. It
is a good many weeks since the hatpin law
was passed, and so far woman, lias taken
practically no notice of it. So she got off
very cheaply at 11s.
The disclosures of “Rough Coal”: N. S.
Wales has no monopoly in the way of in-
competent John Dunns, nor has A ictoria-
not by long chalks. South Aus. holds as
proud a record for unlumbered malefactors
as any State—and a dashed side better
than most. Here is the position to date: —
(1) J. H. Townley (long sentence) escaped from
Dry Creek Stockade, leaving his convict garb in an
Adelaide street as a memento. Eight months have
sped. J.H.T. is still tasting the joys of freedom. (2)
Two remanded prisoners escaped from Gladstone Gaol.
After a few weeks one (Murch) was re-captured near
Pt. Augusta. He stole a boat in order to cross Spen-
cer’s Gulf, otherwise he would have avoided re-cap-
ture. His mate is still at large. (3) About the same
time, at Kadina, one W. A. Skewes got a 10 minutes
start of the local police, and disappeared. Some two
months later, he was arrested at Horsham by the Vic-
torian police for stealing a blanket from a fettler on
the railway. At Kadina he had accumulated an em-
porium of furniture, hardware, etc., and another depot
at Kilkenny, near Adelaide. He even commandeered
a complete four-roomed lot from an Anglican parson
during his absence honeymooning in an adjacent Staty,
and established his depot close to the police station.
The murderers of Constable Hyde after three years
lapse, are still “wanted” ; also the perpetrators of
innumerable burglaries around Adelaide and through-
out the larger country eei>tres.
The Force puts ip its finest work arresting
old Sprah Francisco 1 (she achieved her 394th
conviction for drunkenness last week), but
there is a growing feeling in the community
that the repeated runnings-in. of tsarah tail
to meet the situation. There is such a thing
as over-specialisation.
The modern burglar’s pestiferous habit of
doing business at the houses of those who
have had big wins at the races has gone nigh
to bursting up at least one happy Melbourne
home. Blink, tlie godly house-father, awoke
in the small, bleak hours of Sunday morning,
with the smell of a revolver under his
nose. The man behind the gun was sit-
ing on the edge of Blink’s bed. His
cobber was tossing the contents out ot
drawers, and investigating cases and caskets.
Mrs. Blink was already awake, sitting up
with a stark expression. “You had a big
win to-day,” said the man on the bed waving
the gun with the gentle, persuasive style ot
the platform orator. “You.got 20 to 1 about.
Hyphen.” Blink protested feebly that he
was a conspicuous churchman, that he .never
went to races, and abominated the pernicious
practices of hookies and betting men, “Ar-r,
g’wan!” snorted the gentle burglar, ‘ you
were at the races. Your missus was with
you. You both pulled off a good punch over
Hyphen’s win. Ante!” After a few more
feeble protests, Blink, still stabbed with the
revolver barrel, went into the next room,
and found £O2 in a locked desk. Mrs. Blink,
wearing quite a new expression, supervised
the proceedings. Blink’s real trouble began
when the burglars left. You see, T wasn t
Mrs. Blink who was with him at the races
that day. He never took her to wicked
places of that sort.
“Rimu” runs against the Sydney property
boom :
At Middle Harbor, where the oysters have typhoid
and the placid water sees a steamer once a week,
I went to view an alleged house situated in an alleged
street. Somewhere in the midst of a bush permeated
with signs of a dairy farm, a steep track, leaped
headlong over a rocky cliff, from which grew a
tangled mass of scrub and garden weeds. On a nar-
row shelf, near the bottom, some rude stone walls
supported an uncertain-looking structure of wood
and iron. Below was a moist cellar containing a
kitchen stove, and above, some pieces of verandah
stuck out at haphazard from the two or three de-
cayed and precarious cabins which were intended to
represent bedrooms. Everything looked as ancient
as the hutches in the Argyle Cut, and the general
atmosphere of ruin was supported by two
rose bushes, an unpruned fruit tree, and great masses
of damp and straggling vegetable matter. At the
water’s edge the unhealthy oysters had eaten the
wire-netting from a former swimming enclosure,
and a suggestion of a boatshed was given over to
the chaste embraces of the ’mollusc. The upset value
of the rocky site might have been anything up to
£lOO. The buildings at a reasonable estimate were
worth a third of that amount. Yet a friend, who was
anxious to rent the unpleasant ruins at a pound a week,
spoke too late. The demand for choice residential
properties of the kind is so great that only by
special favor will a landlord consent to accept less
than 50 per cent, on the capital value of his de-
cayed posts and rusty iron. These days a salt-water
swamp,, about 12 miles from Sydney and with no
railwav, tram or steamer to it, has been bought - at
as much as £3 a foot. We are indeed having a
great time.
South Australia’s south-east has been try-
ing for about a year to settle an odd dispute.
A squatter’s son fell in love with a nice
township girl. His parents had other views,
also it was a “mixed” match as regards
creeds. So his mother wrote some kindly,
dignified maternal letters to the girl, pointing
out that the step proposed would not be for
the happiness of either. About the same time,
utterly vulgar anonymous letters began to fly
round, suggesting that the girl was no good,
and that the youth was going to give her
“the dirty chuck out.” After looking hard
at the letters of both kinds, the girl claimed
that they were all written by the same
PRESENCE OE MIND.
FAT CANDIDATE (wildly): “ Yes, gentlemen, show me a Lahorite and Ell show you a rogue.
HERCULES SMITH ( stepping forward) : "Well, I'm a Lahorite; what about it?"
CANDIDATE (sparring for time): "Oh, you are? Pleased to meet you, I'm sure. Er
oh y es — l said I’d show you a rogue, gentlemen. It's our chairman! He told me
before the meeting that there was not a Labor man in the township. lie IS a rogue,

hand! It seemed unlikely, and in the result-
ing libel action a local jury decided that it
was untrue. The bride-that-isn’t then took
her mother-in-law-that-might-have-been into
the Supreme Court on appeal; and, after
hand-writing “experts” on both sides had
said all that was expected of them, Chief
Justice Way took his own magnifying glass,
and decided that the writing, though cleverly-
disguised, was the same. .So the girl gets
1200 —or a chance of it, for there is to be
more appealing yet.
The N.S.W. Drink Act, which is a pro-
duct of the somewhat remarkable intelli-
gence of C. G. Wade, permits the pubkeeper
to sell beer on Christmas Day and Good
Friday, provided it isn’t consumed on the
licensed premises, and much good money
has gone in Costs in trying to ascertain
what “consumed on the licensed premises”
really means. Judge Edmunds' was lately
asked to have another clash with the pro-
blem. A Pitt-street publican had erected,
4ft. above the footpath, a plank, which was
virtually a counter. Upon it, last Christ-
mas night, drinks were served through the
bar door to the passing thirsty, who, when
they had achieved their purpose, deposited
their mugs on the plank, whence they were
retrieved by the barman. The ingenious
publican was Summoned, not for obstruct-
ing' the thoroughfare, but for allowing the
public to consume beer on his. licensed pre-
mises. Judge Edmunds decided that the
plank was not licensed. Which seemed obvi-
ous enough. The police were equally unlucky
in prosecuting a Redfern Bung for selling
beer last Good Friday. His defence was
that someone knocked at the door. When he
cautiously r opened it, most of Redfern fell
in through the aperture, and while he was
busy explaining to them that the pub was
shut, the Johns arrived. Judgment for the
harassed hotelkeeper.
“Aqua”: The S.A. coast is an ill-lighted
sea frontier, and a big sea-murder must
surely be getting ready. There is not a
single light on the track for boats from the
Althorpes to Streaky, Denial or Murat bays.
When the Rupara arrived at Murat Bay
the other night it could not see its way to
the jetty, the lights on the shore being mixed
and confusing, and the local agent stood on
the end of the jetty striking matches to guide
the steamer in. It was a primitive sort. of
device, unworthy of this great and- bounding
Commonwealth.
The Australian peasant—the sort of being
who makes a poor citizen and a worse sol-
dier—is being steadily turned out as one of
the by-products of the valuable but accursed
dairy-farming industry. The Victorian Bush
Nurses are the latest people to bring the old,
old tale along to the cities. Intelligent trav-
ellers of all sorts have told it before the
Nurses, and the cities have been duly shocked
for 10 minutes or so, and then forgot the
matter, for the small bush child has no vote
and no influence, and though casual sympa-
thisers are plentiful enough in spasms, no
philanthropist has yet arisen to take per-
manent charge of his case and keep pegging
away at it until some reform is effected.
Amongst the things mentioned by the Nurses
and delegates of the Association, at the
meeting in Melbourne, last week, the most
horrible was that of a small boy who cut his
foot with an axe, and had the
wound sewed up by a well-meaning
but ignorant mother, who dimly re-
membered hearing that doctors sewed
up wounds. The job was done with the
family needle and thread, without antiseptics,
and, after weeks of agony, the patient was
taken 78 miles to a doctor, and had the leg
amputated. Then there were the old familiar
stories of families pigging in hermeticafly-
sealed one-rodmed huts, and the soul-deaden-
ing toil that begins before the light, and
only ends a few brief hours before the light
comes up again. From a purely financial
standpoint the dairying industry is highly
profitable; but the financier overlooks the
peasant, and the peasant is a national bad
debt. ,*

request for work): “ For the forty-fifth time ,

WAYFARER: “ OR right! But I don't see why

"T. O’Fipp”: The first Art Society of
Australia was black. 1 don’t know whether it was
allowed by charter to style itself “Royal,” but the
art was there all right. If our black brother Combo
had never done anything else, just meditate on the
thing of beauty he has made of the common or Sunday,
morning beer-bottle, fashioning it into many-faceted
spear-heads, besides which the richest ornaments of
green jade are common, dull and twopenny. Same
with the ex-receptacles of whisky, brandy and old tom.
Even the useful but homely telegraph insulator of
Central Australia has attracted our dark brother’s
notice. Art always has an eye on higher things.
“Sliprail”: That recent tale pitched by
“Wanderer” about women laborers in the Wimmera,
especially the lady grafter on the hand winnower,
has nothing wrong with it except that it isn’t a
statement of fact. I know the Wimmera well from
Mildura to Wal Wal, and from the Grampians to
Lake Hindmarch, and everywhere the harvester reign-
eth alone. The hand winnower is as extinct as the
type of Wimmera girl who could be induced or forced
to turn it. About the only machine most of -hem
will turn to in these prosperous times is the piano,
one of which is practically in every home. As a
matter of fact, the girls, to a considerable extent,
have been educated above their surroundings, and
scorn marriage with the sons of neighboring cockies.
Consequently, Dad has too many of them left on his
hands as a sort of high-class old maid. And you
can take it from me they won’t tickle the winnower
or toy with fencing posts and rails.
Dear Bulletin, —A scene of gloom and
harrowing desolation is the site of old Peak Downs,
copper industry, near Clermont (Q.). Greed, star-
vation of development work, and a despicable variety
of financial management are the visible causes of
the old mine’s idleness to-day. Apart from the pro-
digal policy of comparatively ancient times —times
which date back as far as 1866 —of pig-rooting the
rich surface ores, the history of the mine’s more re-
cent ownership is one calculated to make a genuine
miner cry. . Over-capitalisation, indifferent manage-
ment, copper over £lOO per ton, swelled-headedness,
reckless dividends paid on matte while still in transit,
horrible slump of metal market in 1907, liquidation,
abandonment, goats, rust, and, finally, a landscape
filled with gloom. And, of course, they blame the
mine! There probably isn’t another mining tene-
ment in Australia to-day which smells more offen-
sively in the nostrils of investors than this bid free-
hold. Nothing that the mine ever did can justify it.
Also, there probably isn’t another idle mine perishing
under better auspices in the States. Coal, timber,
railway, labor, etc., are on the spot. There is no
metallurgical difficulty, no bugbear in the shape of
superfluous water, no nothing, but the want of a
whole-souled miner at the head of things. With
Blair Athol only 12 miles away to supply inexhaust-
ible fuel, and other things being propitious, it seems
inexplicable that a big 6 per cent, proposition can’t
be maintained on a commercial basis. To cap all,
and complete the humor of things, it is now alleged
that all plans, records, data, etc., pertaining, to the
old mine have been lost, or mislaid. That they have,
in short, joined the vast majority of things that
Have Been. Like Pompeii, and Pharaoh’s bones, and
the Missing Will, and the Foxolophodon, and the
Recipe for Building Pyramids, they are not. In fact, ■
officially, the old mine is not now supposed to exist,
and it will take two archeologists and a dog to re-
discover it. It is all very sad and depressing; and,
though it was a beautiful sunny afternoon when I
visited the ancient workings, I came away like a
person from a funeral. —Yours regretfully, Maula-
rapoonie.

“Sidney S. Severn’s” observations: —
The Papuan varies in appearance, according to his
venue. Thus the Hanuabada boy is distinctly
Malayan. Along the reefs by Hula and Aroma the
type is Chinese; and the Tauripe, Polynesian. The
Binundele, from about the Mombare, I do not know
—save as big, merry babes, who toil gaily on planta-
tions and around miners’ camps. One I happened
across, dying in a sick compound, sang a most exqui-
site swan song in a glorious tenor that held me for
hours. The Kiwais, of the Fly River, are Hebraic.
Strange to say their most ordinary names are Hosea
and Mosi.
His beautiful black teeth are the striking feature
of the Papuan beau. The blacker his teeth the bigger
the beau. His hair is most amazing. It stands out
like a mop of soft moss, brown, with burnt umber
edges. During the day he decorates it with red
flowers, and at night with white, because they. show
up better. His kit is a printed calico rami, topped
by a cotton singlet. He glories in grass armlets and
anklets, which he wears very tight and thrust through
with flowers. If he can get an odd sock or old tennis
shoe on one foot, he radiates conceit, and supreme
contempt for the unshod cannibal.
The Hanuabada lady is mostly missioned, and
clothed accordingly in precarious print of dressing-
gown design. She runs to cheap lace and any amount
of ribbon. When she has evaded the missionaries
she is rather Italian, though she “coys’ her grass
skirls with the grace of a Parisian. And when she
twines yards of blood-red beads about her body, and
drags a gold silk shawl across her shoulders, and
puffs daintily at a trade tobacco cigarette, while
glancing from under her eyelashes, she is almost
alluring.
The motu-motuan Tauripe is magnificent. He
stalks round, six foot of him, in a broad, tight bark
belt, that spreads his hips and shoulders. The rest
of his gear is grass sporran and dogs’ teeth. For
special events —such as sitting all day on the plat-
form of a rani (communal house), for the passers-by
to admire, which he does for 10 months out of the
12, he prinks his hair with beaded bands and birds o’
Paradise. He sticks a nose-bone six inches long
through his septum and the shin-bone of a man
through the bracelet on his arm. Also, he blackens
his teeth and polka-dots his well-fcaiured face with
blue and crimson spots.
His women do all the work. They make and tend
the gardens, and the young girls do the fishing.
The marriageable belles cover their chests with oily
red clay, and spray out their hair like pampas grass.
Married women shave their heads, and widows plaster
their bodies with pounded charcoal, and conceal their
blushes under a curtain-drape of netted rami fibre.
The budding bucks, who look like ancient Egyptian
princes, wear two tiny tufts of hair, one above the
brow, the other on the poll.
Half-castes are noticeably few, though nearly every
village has its albinoes, with dreadful pink skins and
pale blue eyes. Also, there are light-colored strays
with fair hair and hazel eyes, born of browr progeni-
tors. The Hebraic Kiwai is the brai.. of black
Papua. He has the trading instinct well developed, and
is, assuredly, no fool. Finally, an old miner man, who
has travelled everywhere or thereabouts, told me that
in crossing the ranges from Kokoda, where snow is
on deck always, in a mountain village high on a hill,
fortified, and all but inaccessible,, he saw the most

“Gil” : The rabbit is a monopolist. He
will follow a poison trail and devour 20 baits
before the indigestibles contained bring him
to a dead stop. Now, one bait is quite sufficient
to obliterate any ordinary rabbit, so, by enveloping
the extra 19 he not only proves himself a glutton,
but also denies 19 other rabbits the privilege of
being dead. However,- you can beat him at his own
game by mixing the poison with raspberry or any
other small-seeded jam, and placing it about in
minute quantities wherever Bunny scratches for his
living. Then, as soon as he samples a little bit
for a start, some of the seeds get into his hollow
tooth, and, while he is endeavoring to pick them
out with a grass-stem, the deadly mi '.are lays him
low. Pumpkin or pie-melon jam is useless, because
its seeds are too large to enter his hollow tooth.
STOLEN FRUIT.
HOUSEWIFE: “Half these peaches are bad and
the rest are green. What do you mean by
leaving such fruit?"
HAWKER: “Sorry, leddy, but ’ow kin -we see
which is the ones ter pick in the dark? "
Wild cry of “Paddymelon” :
Where are the cheeses of my youth ? The ripe old
dainty that had to be taken to the woodheap and
carved with an axe before serving; the comestible
that mother insisted on keeping under the house be-
cause she said it faded the carpets ; the foodstuff that
we used to rub on to the legs of the meat-safe to
keep the ants away ? The modern cheeses are broken
to single and double harness and side-saddle. Any
lady can handle them. They put me in mind of the
soap my married sister Ann used for washing her
baby ; or again, they suggest one of these new-fangled
skin foods. They are as tame as a new curate. There
was a virile tang about some of those old-time cheeses
that made the mere Limburger look (and smell)
anasmic, and pushed the Gorgonzola, however decayed,
into the remote background. Has Socialistic legisla-
tion banished them? Have the health authorities
got wise to their existence, and taken measures ac-
cordingly? I thirst for tidings of them.

“N. or M.” : Apropos of the forthcoming
Federal postage stamp, the design for which —a
kangaroo on an empty stomach (I mean an empty
continent) —is almost painfully appropriate. Here
are a few items salvaged from Tassy’s early postal
records, before the time of stamps and envelopes.
Letters were, as often as not, paid for on delivery,
frequently in kind, coin of the realm being a scarce
commodity and rum a favorite medium of exchange.
The Sydney Government on one occasion instructed
Lieutenant-Governor Collins to pay SO empty salt-
meat casks to the skipper of a. sealing sloop, for de-
livering despatches -to Governor King. Mails left at in-
frequent and irregular intervals, being sometimes ad-
vertised for two or three months beforehand. The
following is from the Hobart Town Gazette, of
May, 1817: “As a direct opportunity offers of for-
warding a mail by his Majesty’s armed brig Kan-
garoo, for England, which is hourly expected to sail,
the inhabitants are hereby informed that a letter-
bag is now open for the reception of all letters from
those who wish to write to their friends in Eng-
land.” All letters arriving in the colony were duly
advertised in the Gazette. There was a haphazard _
arrangement for the delivery of mails, by which post-
masters kept all money received for the transmission
of letters, whilst the Government paid the expenses
of the messengers in consideration of official letters
passing free. Jerusalem, Jordan, Jericho, Tiberias
and other Biblically-named localities along the old
main road from Hobart to Launceston, which are
generally supposed to have been christened by an
Imperial regiment fresh from Palestine, were really
named by one of these messengers, a profane and
cursing person named Morris, who also distinguished
himself by writing a will of such profanity that
water had to be poured over it by his executors to
prevent spontaneous combustion. In 1828 the post-
office became a public institution, under the first
Colonial Post Office Act. Bushrangers and blacks
were a source of annoyance, and pistols, blunder-
busses and double guns figure as items among the
post-office expenses. The roads being as rough as
the times, a report states that “the firearms were
much worn by the constant friction to which they
were liable by the jolting of the mail coach, and
had also been injured by the upsetting of the coach
on two or three occasions.” The town postman of
the old colonial days promenaded the streets with
bag and bell, and might have been seen any night
between five and six, Sundays excepted, ringing his
implement of clangor that people might bring out
their letters and newspapers. Instead of stamping,
he marked each letter with the amount paid upon it,
and took an additional Id. for his trouble.
“Jimmie Pannikin” : Something—perhaps
the beauty of the stars or the loss of the Titanic —
reminds me of “Snuffling Jimmie,” and also of
“Teddy-without-a-Shirt.” One afternoon the shang-
hai (coach of an Outback kind) pulled up at a pub
away out behind the sunset, and the said “Snuffling
Jimmie” shuffled out of the bar, and requested me to
drink. I declined, because I- am a physical wreck,
weighing 17 stone. M.M.M., called “The Three
Ems,” or “Mulga Madness Mixture,” has no charms
for me. Jimmie was visibly affected by my refusal
to irrigate. lie wept and called me “a stuck-kup
Government blanky toff,” so to conciliate him I said:
“By Jove, it looks like rain. I hope we get two or
three inches!” “Do yer?” snuffled Jimmie; “well,
I don’t!” “Why?” “Because when it rains a hincli
or two, th’ melons grows all hover th’ place; when
the’ melons grows, th’ horses eats ’em; when tIT
horses eats melons they goes blind —and, mindger,
matey, when horses goes blind, I swear somethink
blanky cruel, so there y’are. An’, anyway, yer a
stuck-kup Government blanky toff.”

THE CRITIC : “After all, what is there in the
world so beautiful as woman?"
“Wyn de WifE”: I have noticed the fol-
lowing too frequently to be mistaken
All birds have a derry on birds which have lived
in captivity.
If a native bird escapes from captivity he is in-
variably left to the derry of his own tribe.
If a canary or suoh-like foreigner escapes to the
open, the derry is administered indiscriminately.
Magpies, butcher birds and crows, after long cap-
tivity, are individually a match for any four or five
wild specimens when the derry is in full blast.
Can’t supply an explanation of these facts.
THE MUSICAL COW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A well-known authority on music is responsible for
Hie statement that a cow moos in a perfect “fifth.”
So Posy, moo-ing in her perfect “fifth,”
May yet induce her king to greater thrift —
May open up a vista, brighter far
Than any gleamed on by the morning star!
He’s tinned her creamless milk, and milky cream,
And cheese which brings the female equine dream ;
He’s turned the flesh to beef, her hide to boots —
In which the “broke” and hard-pressed lodger
scoots.
She was an Eldorado, sure enough—-
What though her milk was weak, her carcase
tough,
Her butter rancid, and her cheeses, too—
And now there’s money in her magic moo!
For who shall say her voice is not sublime,
When records sell for eighteenpence a time ;
When Spot’s soprano wakens from its lair —
And hubby’s bass doth thunder through the air?
A “sixth”—and- “seventh” may yet be beseeched
From Posy’s neck, until an octave’s reached.
And, after that —well, where will Melba be
When Posy liberates her melody !
We yet may live to read how Madam Kine
Rose in the singer’s firmament, to shine.
We’ll read how garlands hung upon her horns —
And no one dared to tread upon her corns!
Oh, one-time most unsentimental cow,
For insults offered I am sorry now;
For you might all the gods of greatness woo
With that bail-bursting, leg-roped, milky moo!

“P. Malthus”: The kiwi, Maoriland’s
wingless bird, is becoming very scarce. On an island
where I lived for a year there were several pairs of
these birds, but, try as I might, I could never get a
sight of one in the daytime. There was too much
cover for them to hide in. I have had glimpses of
them in the moonlight. They were very noisy dur-
ing the winter, calling out at frequent intervals
throughout the night. About September they be-
came suddenly silent, and never uttered a cry until
the following April, when they started again. I
think these queer birds will soon be extinct except
where they are preserved in sanctuaries. For cen-
turies they flourished, because they had no enemies
until man came. Then, being red-rag anti-militar-
ists and enthusiastic members of the Peace Society,
whose principles precluded self-preservation, they
began to be wiped out, without even being called
upon for their views in the matter.

“Orient”: Rev. E. Martin, late of St.
Patrick’s, Melbourne, is the writer of a pamphlet on
Java, just issued by the Australian Catholic Truth
Society. He records his impressions after a visit. Of
course, the German programme is to acquire the
island as part of the Dutch possessions. Britain does
not care much, but the question is of interest to Aus-
tralia. Father Martin unfolds Java as the most fer-
tile and populous tropical island, the Garden of the
North. Length nearly 600 miles, breadth varies from
28 to 105. The climate is more trying than that of
Australia’s Northern Territory, yet see how the
whites flourish in Java. Twenty active volcanoes.
Semeroe lifts its smoking summit 13,000 ft. In the
Krakatau eruption (1883) a mass of land three and
a half miles long by two miles in width was blown
into the air, and replaced by sea to the depth of
1000 ft. The tidal wave engulphed 40,000 people.
Numerous rivers are utilised for irrigation. Second
only to Cuba in sugar. The Java outputs exceeds
1,000,000 tons in the year. Tea and coffee are great
staples. Work is very light. Altogether about the
happiest population on earth. Whites and darkies
generally converse in Malay, which is native to
neither. Javanese is a more difficult language for
whites. Native population over thirty millions.
Dutch number 80,000. Chinese, 500,000, including
half-castes. The Arabs number 30,000. The Japan-
ese are few, as yet.

“Pick,”: Full-blooded aborigines in New
South Wales are becoming as scarce as whisky
flasks at a Wesleyan chapel. I attended the blanket
distribution at a N. S. Wales South Coast camp
recently, and among the 175 inhabitants that rolled
up to claim their share of “gub’ment” beneficence,
only eight were passed as pure nigger. The rest
owned up to being mulatto, quadroon or octoroon.
The colors ranged from brown-black to dirty white,
and one girl, with bright red hair and a fair,
freckled face, was claimed as daughter by a very
sooty man and lubra. By the way, I once saw a
similar fair-haired child in the hands of 1 an aboriginal
couple at Brungle, N.S.W., and I would really like
to know if it is anyone’s business to hunt up
proofs when such an anomaly appears. So far as I
know, aborigines do not register their offspring very
regularly, but the death of a white child in a blacks’
camp is quite a common occurrence.
An old book of 1610, describes an “ingin to bt
lett downe into a myne or pitt that shall drawe fif-
teene tunne of water in one hower’s space at one
hundred fadam depth with the helpe onlye of two
able menne; if the depth be but fiftie fadam, one
manne shall drawe the haulfe of fifteene tunne.”
Quaint old days those. In our superior wisdom we
ridicule 1610. But how about our more enlightened
descendants ridiculing 1912, wonder Phillips Ormonde

SOUR GRAPES.
HERBERT (bitterly): "There's a fly' in your beer, Harold.
Don’t you know that flies is terrible germ distributors? ”
HAROLD : "Yes, Herbert , that's wot the beers for —to kill the germs."
“Eddyson” : He was a tall, lean man, with
something of a martial air. He stood extremely
erect in a five-acre plot of suburban land, surrounded
by a broken fence and dilapidated hedge of furze,
and yapped loudly in the moonlight. The performer
was apparently quite unconscious of the presence of
Briggs and Mullhill, who crouched among the furze,
and watched the demonstration with considerable ap-
prehension. “Ri’ turn!” yelled the man. “Ri’ turn!
Ri’ turn! Ri turn! ” Then he cleared his throat,
and pitched his plaint a key higher. “Ri’ ’bout
turn 1 For-r-r-m fo’rs 1 By your ri’— wheel.’’ The
man in the paddock remained rigid. But for himself
the five acres were desolate. “Mad!” whispered
Briggs. “Ez th’ Devil’s own pig,” responded Mull-
hill. “For-r-rm fo’rs!” yapped the man in the pad-
dock. “Mar-rch!” Spender joined Briggs and Mull-
hill. “ ’Tis a poor idyit,” said Mullhill. “T’inks
heis fightin’ the wars,” said Briggs. “Better be
bringin’ th’ po-lice some wan,” said Mullhill. “Sho’-
der a’ms!” shouted the lean man. “Sho’der a’ms!
Sho’der a’ms!” “’Twould be dang’ris for the
weemin ’n’ children if he bruck out,” said Mullhill.
“Better be bringin’ th’ po-lice somewan.” Spender
went for the police, and when Constable Hazybury
arrived, the lone man on the waste land was shout-
ing sternly: “Ri’ ’bout face l Ri’ ’bout face I By
your ri’— march!” “Ravin’ mad!” agreed Hazy-
bury. - “Hommysidal manyah, ’n’ delusions—that’s
what. We’ll on him at wanst. Maybe he’ll be
shootin’.” Presently four solid citizens hurled them-
selves out of space on to the maniac. There was a
dusty, clamorous and chaotic fight lasting about two
minutes, and then Constable Hazybury towed away
his prize carefully clamped in darbies, and with a
length of hayband attached to his off fetlock. This
hayband Mullhill held in the rear, alert to trip up
the prisoner if he became obstreperous. And after
all the long, lean, vociferous individual was only a
drill instructor exercising and perfecting his yell.
In the Omeo (Vic.) district, the other day,
the body of a selector, partly eaten by dogs, was
found in the-bush. The name of the deceased selec-
tor was Charles Price.’ Hews of the gruesome find
was brought to the Omeo police by “a boundary
rider named William Ah Chow, employed by a
Hindu.” Truly a horrible fate for a White Aus-
tralian ! ,
“Sr.”: The kind of girl the Australian
bush breeds, as related at a meeting of the borough
council of Green Ponds (Tas.j. Three years, ago
the father and mother of a family living in the
bush, died, leaving five children, aged 14, eight, six,
three and one year. Therp was not sufficient money
left to bury the parents, but neighbors saw to that.
Then the neighbors considered what was to be done
with the children, and jtist there the 14-year-old
daughter took a hand. She thanked everybody, but
said she would be able to manage. After that she
mothered the family. God knows how she pulled
through, but she did it by earning a few shillings
hop picking and fruit gathering, and she got a help-
ing hand now and again from a friendly neighbor.
She scraped and suffered and mended and battled
with ailments in the lonely little hut, and crooned
over the baby, rocking the cradle with one hand
and shooing the wolf from the door with the other.
A few days ago a councillor of Green Ponds got on to
the facts, and suggested that it was time something
was done to recognise heroism in its Class A form.
I am glad to say that the suggestion is likely to be
adopted.
THE UNCAPTURED MYTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
‘•Convicts with capital,” was the attractive head-
ing that recently adorned the northern end of a para-
graph in a Sydney daily. But the hopes of the opti-
mist were dissipated when a more southerly perusal
showed that the capitalists were American long-
sentence prisoners, who had hoarded up the money
earned by gaol labor.
Ho ! ho! thought I, he’s caught at last —
That mystic fortune quester
Who at our methods stands aghast—
The Mythical Investor!
I wondered what queer circumstance
With durance vile distraught him —
Was it design, or lucky' chance,
And who on earth had caught him.
At last, I thought, we’ll stand before
This banshee hesitater,
Who’d come here if it wasn’t for
The Labor legislator.
We'll vjew his load of shining quids,
Piled ceilingward behind him
In golden gleaming pyramids,
What time the peelers mind him.
We’ll see the wealth that dodged us long—
A great imposing courtful—-
The soys, that sang a siren song
In manner loud and sportful.
We’ll lean our weary optics on
Those ten elusive millions
On which our eyes had never shone
(Or was it ninety billions?).
But all our hopes to Dead Sea fruit
Return ; our dreams to ashes ;
This Midas proves to be a brute
Whose cheque no country cashes!
I dropped the paper in disgust;
Gone was my dream enraptured:
His sovereigns are red with rust —
The Myth is still uncaptured!
N.S.W.
GILROONEY.
The Second Centenary of N.S.W.
New South Wales is due this year for its
second centenary. The first befell nearly 30
years ago, when Victoria was on the throne,
and Battenberg was still a jest, and
Parkes and Carrington and Patrick Jen-
nings were still possible. That was the
hundredth anniversary of the Day We Were
Lagged, and great were the riot and the
rum-and-onions thereof. The next centen-
ary will fall on the day when N.S.W. owes
a hundred million pounds, and it is expected
to get there about June. Unless unexpected
ill-luck falls on Premier McGowen he will
be the potentate in charge when this eYent
arrives, and he deserves to be. No one
could fill the position to more advantage.
McGowen stands for a party which in-
cludes economy and reduction of borrowing
among the leading features of its policy.
Theoretically it is solid on honest finance.
Yet with a shameless and cynical lack of
principle which even Parties, in his hairiest
days, never excelled, the McGowen Govern-
ment has developed into the most lavish
spender of loan money that even the thrift-
less Ma State ever saw. Last financial year,
which year was also McGowen’s responsi-
bility, saw the ordinary expenditure of the
State reach a point never before heard or
dreamt of. And for the first eight months of
this financial year the ordinary outgoings
are nearly £BOO,OOO more than they were for
the corresponding period of last year. That
would not matter if the increase of expendi-
ture arose through a habit of charging to
revenue works which were formerly paid for
out qf loans. But the McGowen Ministry
spending loan money at the rate of
£5,400,000 a year, and in this respect also
it beats every past record. It is hardly pos-
sible to go on at this rate without a smash,
but apparently the axiom of McGowen is:
“After me the deluge, and so long as it is
after me I don’t care how soon it comes.”
And his other axiom apparently is: “The
way to keep office is to give the people a
good time while you are in office, and never
mind how you do it.” This stupendous
scatteration of loan money is really an ex-
tensive system of bribery—coarse, ordinary,
dull, commonplace bribery. It is a case of
buying communities with works which are
supposed to cost them nothing, the bill being
left to posterity—buying communities with
the money of future generations instead of
buying individuals with the money of this
generation. The process serves to disguise
incapacity, laziness, stupidity, and all the
other political vices. The McGowen Gov-
ernment seems to have forgotten almost
every professed feature of its policy and to
have become a spender pure and simple. It
no longer talks of abolishing the State Gov-
ernor or the Upper House. It is anti-Aus-
tralian and anti-Federal w T herever possible.
Its alleged decentralisation policy has been
sacrificed to the interests of the Sydney
landlords. It declared war against the prin-
ciple of co-operation, and proceeded to tax
the poorest Australian manufacturing com-
pany on a higher scale than the rich absen-
tee landlord. On this point it gave way, to
some extent, but only when the shout of
popular execration became too much for it.
Its desire to specially penalise even the
most struggling form of Australian joint
stock industry still stands to its dis-
credit. It is allied with the worst
forms of Toryism in opposition to the
proposed Bank of the People. It makes
a scoff and a mockery of its professed pro-
gramme of honest finance. Yet, because it
calls itself “Labor” it evidently considers it-
self entitled to claim the support of all be-
lievers in the Labor programme, no matter
how widely it may deviate from that pro-
gramme. And the. deviation is very wide.
Just now the Labor programme and the
N.S.W. Labor Ministry are not much more
alike than the Church of Christ and some
of the people who called themselves His
vicars on earth.
A Sidelight on What the Yankee Thinks
of Australia.
The month before last, a 19-year-old U.S.
citizen being filled with pride of race or Old
Rye whisky, or something, grabbed what the
San Francisco Call termed “a sawed-off
shotgun,” and held up and robbed a saloon
or pub at a place* called Pajara Junction.
According to the law of the land he should
have got, for this effort, a term of five years
hard labor, or thereabouts. The actual sen-
tence imposed on him by Superior Judge
Lucas, of Santa Cruz, was that he should
be “exiled to Australia for five years.”
An Australian resident wrote to the
local papers protesting against his native
land being regarded as a dumping
ground for American born and bred outlaws.
Only one paper printed his letter, and it
(the letter) immediately evoked, from a num-
ber of right-thinking citizens, a flood of cor-
respondence pointing out that the offscour-
ings of the U.S. were amply good enough for
a country which, on the evidence of that
country’s leading organs of public opinion,
was controlled, practically from end to end,
by anarchists and thieves. Unpleasant
though it is to do so, it must be admitted
that these Yanks have a certain amount of
justification for the attitude they take up.
Our big “Liberal” papers have, for purely
party purposes, been exploiting anti-Aus-
tralian yarns for so long now that the bulk
of their well-to-do readers have come to take
the grotesque things seriously. There is a
frequent type of Australian “Liberal” who
leaves a well-defined trail of decayed fish
behind him in every foreign centre which he
visits. This sort of calamity habitually re-
presents the Australian Labor Governments
as being composed of confiscatory ruffians
who, with the full approval of a criminal
band of electors, put in their time robbing
the thrifty of their savings, pushing
wrecked Indians back into the ravening
waves, harassing innocent Eurasian ladies
who have been attracted' here by the purest
domestic sentiments, and so forth. On being
challenged by some incredulous foreigner,
these slanderers of their country can always
point to the cuttings from the Australian
daily press in testimony of the truthfulness
of their charges. Only last week, for ex-
ample, Sydney Telegraph published the fol-
lowing—the heading being the work of the
Telegraph, the cable that of Reuter :
FANATICAL SOCIALIST.
Paris, Monday.—Soudy [who is suspected of the
Chantilly bank murders], is known to be a reckless,
fanatical Anarchist.
As the same paper’s leading columns were
full, that morning, of embittered references
to the various “fanatical Socialists”' who
were allegedly rushing the State of N. S.
Wales and Australia to ruin, the foreigner
might well take it that Soudys were com-
mon features of Australia’s Federal and
State Governments. The effect of the
wicked business is that this country is fast
achieving an evil reputation abroad which
will take it years to live down. The fact
that a young U.S. desperado has been
“exiled” here by an ignorant U.S. Judge
matters little in itself. The dangerous youth
will, under the provisions of our excellent
Immigration Restriction Act, be fired back
to the land of the Wooden Ham with the
utmost expedition. The real tragedy lies in
the state of public opinion abroad which has
made it possible that he should be sent here.
That “Liberalism” is almost entirely respon-
sible for the feeling is an undoubted fact. A
question Australia has to face in the name
of self-interest as well as self-respect is:
What shall be done to “Liberalism” to in-
duce it to abandon its defamatory practises?

J. R. Iloulding, who, nearly half a cen-
tury ago, under the pen name of “Old Boom-
erang,” wrote the book, “Australian Gapers,
or Christopher Cockle’s Colonial Experi-
ence,” passed last week into his 91st year.
The ancient walks with a martial tread
towards his century.
Beautiful piece of unintentional sarcasm
by a Melbourne gendarme or Hop who lately
collided with actor Caleb Porter for obstruct-
ing the footpath in Bourke-street: “I asked
him to spell his name, your Worship, but he
wouldn’t. Then I asked him his occupa-
tion, and he said ‘Gentleman’ ; but I found
out afterwards that he was an actor.” That
was gall and wormwood compared to which
the 20s. fine was a mere bagatelle.
One of the candidates at the Tasmanian
election describes himself as “Herbert James
Mockford Payne, member of the House of
Assembly.” If Herbert Sundries is elected
he stands a fair chance to be disqualified for
wrongful description. There was no House
of Assembly when he nominated, and there
were no members. Payne might possibly be
justified in putting down his occupation as
“candidate,” but that is another matter.
FUTURE ADVANTAGE.
THE MAN ON THE LOOK-OUT: “ There's not
much chance of that type running into ice."
Bedford Hack, just dead in Adelaide at
77, had been many things in his time-
digger at Bendigo, station-manager, dairy-
farmer, and a contractor on the Adelaide-to-
Darwin telegraph line. His best work, how-
ever, was done in the service of the Govern-
ment. As Warden of Goldfields, he was
sole boss of Teetulpa while 8000 men were
rushing that field ; and for nearly 20 years
he managed the Sewage Farm which makes
Adelaide one of Australia’s cleanest cities —
and he made the farm show a profit, too.
Horace De Lissa, killed by a fall from his
horse while out riding on Sunday, was a Syd-
ney native, and son of Alfred De Lissa,
solicitor. He was educated at Sydney Uni-
versity, and called to the Bar in November,
1901. He was only 36 years of age when
the most unreliable animal in the world fell
on him and cut short his career.
“Gilrooney”: At various times, but mostly
when he figured in the “also ran” division,
I have seen a great deal of A. H. Conroy,
the Tory choice for Hall’s vacant Werriwa
(N.S.W.)seat. It is his chronic tendency on
the hustings, like that other eminent Liberal,
Colonel Ryrie, to speak stoush and economics
in the one breath. I’ll admit, had he fol-
lowed his rightful vacation, he might have
developed into a very formidable opponent
of Jack Johnson. He has the size and the
happy knack of not recognising defeat or
even derision. A mighty good pugilist was
spoiled to make a wretchedly bad politician
the day when Conroy started out to save
his country.
“Alb” wanders all over the place:—
What is this Pallium with which Archbishop Carr
has invested Archbishop Kelly? It is only a long-
strip of white lambs’ wool, embroidered with some
purple crosses and a little gold. Hangs from the
neck in Y-form, both before and behind. The
Pallium always comes from the Pope as the insignia
of office. Until it came Archbishop Kelly only had
a sort of informal appointment, conferred by tele-
graph. At first the Pallium was only worn by Popes.
Then it was conferred on very distinguished ecclesias-
tics. The next step was making it an insignia for all
prelates. The lambs for the wool are presented in
Rome every year by the nuns of St. Agnes, during
the Agnus Dei at mass, in a certain church on St.
Agnes’s Day. Mystic purity is denoted. The lambs
are carefully tended until shorn. The Pallium gave
rise to an old English alcoholic Christmas decoction,
of the punch order, called lambs’ wool. People
didn’t get half so drunk when they had a myriad of
such tickling decoctions. Not like straight swiping.
There was a sacred feeling in gently washing the
neck, even of a giraffe order, with lambs’ wool.
During a Melbourne case of Sunday liquor trading, a
witness said, in mitigation, that there was only a
dim religious light in the bar.
Died in a Melbourne prison last week the
notorious Mrs. Downing, professional abor-
tionist. It took the local police a long time
to get Mrs. D. out of business. She weath-
ered the storm of about a dozen prosecutions
for malpractice, or murder, before she was
eventually convicted of the capital offence.
Then her death sentence was commuted, of
course, to penal servitude for life, or 20
years, or some other term, which amounted
to a lifer. The old girl cut it short by pass-
ing out at the age of 65, deeply reprobated by
many people who had had no occasion to re-
gard her as a refuge in time of trouble. A
number of girls died at Mrs. Downing’s, no
doubt, and her influence on the “moral tone”
of the community was pernicious—but the
abortionist merely supplied a demand which
in a great measure is created by Mrs.
Grundy. When Mrs. Grundy is not the orig-
inal culprit, the selfishness of “respectable
married women” is to blame. Anyhow, it is
absurd to argue that a Mrs. Downing
encourages abortion even as a “fence” en-
courages burglary. Mrs. Grundy is equally
shocked by both misdmeanors, but in one
case her uneasy virtue is distinctly the cause
of the crime, and in the other case it dis-
tinctly isn’t.
“U.S.”: Millionaire
Guggenheim, the Hebrew
evening-dress corpse of
the Titanic, was one of
seven brothers who all
became rich. Their;
father landed in America
as a pauper, and not a
very clean one either. As
with Pulitzer, there was a
question about allowing
him to land, because he
had no prospects, and
could not speak the lan-
guage. After much strug-
gling, he rose to the dig-
nity of a small drapery
business in Philadelphia.
When he had saved a bit,
a friend persuaded him
to take some shares in a
mining company at Lead-
ville, high up on the
Rockies, a place rather
hard to breathe in, but a
great fount of dollars.
Guggenheim, who began
to be threatened with a
slight knowledge -iff Eng-
lish, sent his most dollar-
clawing son to look round
the purlieus of Leadville.
The son reported it was a
big thing, and kept on
buying up shares and importing his brothers
till the family had the whole mine, and there
were no more brothers to import. Then the
old man was able to sky his little haber-
dashery, and go too. Thus there were eight
rich Guggenheims, including the ancient
parent, and the west was cold, because the
aggregate nose of the family blotted out the
sun.
Stead, of the Review of Reviews, had
no luck when the Titanic, went down. He
lived in the limelight, but he didn’t die
therein (presumably he is dead). Nobody
anpears to have seen him after the smash.
He isn’t mentioned as giving frantic orders
like Bruce Ismay, or lifting women into the
boats like Benjamin Guggenheim, the Jew
who put on his evening clothes that he might
die “like a gentleman.” He isn’t spoken of
as striking any attitudes, or saying any-
thing or doing anything, or being anywhere.
The silent blotting out of Stead, while Ben
Guggenheim had the centre of the stage,
suggests that Fate doesn’t know how to run
a theatre.
Billy Aberdeen, Castlemaine’s oldest in-
habitant, and the reputed first discoverer of
gold in Victoria, died 19/4/T2 wtat 94. In
June, 1851, while hawking about the head of
the Plenty River, he picked up some big
grains in one of the creeks that spring from
the Plenty Ranges.
VACCINATION—FREE AND FOR
NOTHING.
Probably as a warning to others, the quarantine
authorities on Sunday vaccinated a party of boaters
who had sought shelter within the prohibited area at
Quarantine Head. The party, comprising a number
of residents of Balmain, having been caught in the
squalls off the Heads, had put into Green Point for
shelter. —Sydney paper.
ENTHUSIASTIC QUARANTINE OFFICER: “What
are you making a rozv about? Eve known
folks pay their doctor a guinea for what
Tm going to give you, for nothing .”
Edmund Francis Ilayes, baronet, formerly
of Sydney, died recently at his ancestral
home in Donegal, Ireland. He left an estate
in New South Wales valued at £5868, so he
wasn’t a very massive absentee. He owned
22,825 acres of land, or bog or something in
Donegal.
“S.T.S.”: As to the advantage of being
a recent king, consider this eulogy:—
His mind was highly cultivated. His benevolence
was proverbial. His charity was real. and unmixed
with ostentation. His manners were perfect. He
was gentle and easy of access; good-humored and
affable in conversation. His religious opinions were
liberal; and his attention to the duties of devotion
regular and becoming. He was lively and agreeable
in society, cheerful and warm-hearted at home. As
a king, his name will live in history amony the few
who have deserved a nation’s prayers and blessings,
who have governed with fatherly affection and wise
guardianship.
This was written by a contemporary bio-
grapher, Rev. G. N. Wright, about —hold
your breath —George IV., generally admitted
nowadays to have been one of the finest
blackguards in Europe. Will the things
said about more recent monarclis come to
sound as humorous as that within 80 years
or so?
Oom Bill Lyne, of N.S.W., was taken sud-
denly ill a month or two ago with a brain
hemorrhage of a kind which usually means
sudden death. It was his second attack of
the sort, and his recovery from the first one
was an event quite out of the ordinary run.
The papers got the valiant old warrior’s
photo, and obituary ready, and waited
with an ear at the keyhole of the Valley of
the Shadow of Death for the latest informa-
tion. And when a tall figure, bowed down
beneath a ton of ironmongery, was seen re-
turning from the Gates of Death to which he
had recently descended, there was a moment
of breathless surprise. Oom Bill had come
back, bringing the gates with him. He had
rooted them up just to show that there was
no animosity.
“Bathurstian” writes of an uncertain sort
of citizen :
Gordon Tidy, who seceded from Anglicanism to
the Church of Home last year, and who has now,
seemingly, re-seceded to Anglicanism, has had a
various sort of career. His first profession was the
Army—not the institution which Ada Ward has
fust abandoned with contumely and scornful words
regarding its niggardliness to earnest Bible-bashers—
but, the British Army, the one whose soldiers, if Kip-
ling is to be believed, are not allowed into respect-
able pubs in time of peace. He found the financial
pace too hot, and abandoned the profession of Blood,
after a while. Then he went to sea. In course of
time he arrived in Australia, passed his examinations
as a jaekeroo, was invested with the insignia of his
new calling, and. started practising. AVearying of
the iackeroo business, he suddenly staggered that
portion of humanity which lived west of the Blue
Mountains, and was acquainted with him, by the
announcement that he meant to become an Anglican
clergyman. He did so, and, for some years, shoul-
der to shoulder with Dean Marriott (now
on his way to England), dealt Beelzebub
good, hard knocks from the vantage-ground
of the Bathurst Cathedral. When Rome ac-
hieved him (or perhaps, in the circunmstances, it
would be more accurate to say, got a short lease of
him), his friends weakly inquired: “What next?”
The late Bishop Camidge ascribed the occurrence to
an old attack of jungle fever ; the views on the mat-
ter of Dean Marriott have never been published, nor
do I think they ever will be.
A popular soul was Gordon Tidy, no matter what
religion or job he happened to be professing for the
moment; and it is safe to say that, if he arrived here
to-morrow as a Buddhist elder or Mormon cardinal,
his welcome would be equally as warm as though he
came as the representative of one of the more con-
ventional faiths. He displayed, when in these oarts,
a fund of knowledge on all sorts of bizarre* and
utterly useless (and, therefore, absorbingly interest-
ing) topics, a sense of humor, and a capacity for
clothing his quaint conceits in literary form, that
are painfully rare among the cloth. He was a
Bulletin contributor of long standing, arid the
writer of the fine verses, on Harry Morant (a friend '
of his jackerooing days), which appeared on the fly-
sheet of “Bushman and Buccaneer.”
The N.S.W. State Governor laid a Sunday-
school foundation stone at Redfern (Syd-
ney) the other day, and threw off the old
speech to the effect that “the right place for
a child to learn religion was at its mother’s
knee.” Now, in the first place, any average
mother has two knees —wooden-legged moth-
ers are scarce. Secondly, moth-
er’s knees stick out in front of
her, and tend to keep the child
off, consequently it more often
has its lessons at mother’s side.
Thirdly, a child learns with its
head, and unless it is a dwarf
its head reaches much higher
than mother’s knee when she
is sitting down—most moth-
ers sit down to impart instruction. As a
matter of fact, it is generally found acquiring
knowledge at its mother’s chest —her upper
chest, not her lower one. Furthermore, these
allusions to half-way down the lady’s legs
are in questionable taste. If the old tradi-
tion must be maintained, why not speak of
mother’s skirts as the scene of education?
“Chasuble” writes in a scrappy frame of
mind and many capital letters about a de-
ceased preacher—-
Butcher Preacher Varley is copiouslv biographed
m the Churchy Press. Yet not the faintest refer-
ence to the carcases. The Religious World is sat-
urated with the principle of English Society that
Labor is Dishonorable and Work is disgraceful.
Surely it is most to Varley’s credit that he Was a
Butcher, and chucked in his Evangelism for nix, be-
sides donating big cash. He and his Father in Law,
a Smithfield Meatite, each planked down One Thou-
sand Pounds for a place called the West London
Tabernacle. Give Giblets the Glory! Varley was
only three years in Geelong. Native' of Lincolnshire.
At 15 years old he was pitched head foremost in
London, and lighted in the big Meat Man’s shop.
Ultimately married Master Meaty’s daughter, and
they were happy for 35 years. Their sons have the
large Stationery Inz of Varley Brothers, in Mel-
bourne. In 1854 Varley, as a single man, made a
dart for himself, and came to Geelong. By 1857,
in those suet-able times, he had made a little pile.
Returned to England to get married and to come
back. Did not come back —not for the Meat. He
was persuaded to stick in London. Made a business
at Notting Hill. Fortune dogged him. Soon able
to retire. While Secularly Moating 16 hours a day
all the week, he ran his own Church on Sunday,
preaching two or three times with a membership of
600 and Sunday School of 800.

Joseph Francis has
hoisted the answering
pennant for the last time
at 93 years of age. He
was for long signal-mas-
ter at South Head, Port
Jackson. In his earlier
day the work was excit-
ing, in a way. The old
wind jammer crawled
out of some European
port, and bobbed on a
lonesome sea for any-
where from three to nine
months. Then it turned
up suddenly like a resur-
rection, or else it didn’t
turn up. For lack of
telegraphs and cables the
signal-master struggled
with his job per medium
•of a sny-glass, and gath-
ered with it what infor-
mation he could. He
didn’t telephone the news to Sydney when
he got it. In those days the first gifted
madman hadn’t begun to dream of the thing
that cuts you off in the middle of your con-
versation.
According to London Telegraph, Aus-
tralia's old and deafening friend, Tom Mann,
was once on the point of taking deacon’s
orders and becoming an Anglican curate.
Well, there have been many kinds of curates,
and Thomas would have been only one more.
When one considers that folk in holy orders
have included Caesar Borgia, General Leon-
idas Polk of the Jeff Davis army, Brother
Devil—otherwise Fra Diavolo, the brigand—
and Dill Macky, it must be admitted that it
is a various sort of profession.
W. D. S. Macdonald, one of Maoriland’s
new Ministry, is the son of a Gippsland
cattle-raiser, and was born at Mount Meing-
wort (Vic.) in 1862. After a fair share of
the company of Matilda and droving, he
crossed, 30. years ago, to the East Coast of
M.L. (North Island), and has been there
ever since. Starting as a station overseer,
he was for a time manager of some of the
Bank of New South Wales pastoral pro-
perties, and also a trader on his own
account. In 1908 he followed Ward into
Parliament, and was early made junior
Government Whip. Now he will look after
Public Works and Native Affairs.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Williams-Endicott Banking Corpora-
tion, Limited, mentioned in last issue o£ The
Bulletin, has lately published an advertisement
which contained a little more information about it-
self than the previous ones. The new advt. set
forth that the corporation, which is understood to
be about to start the erection of very tall buildings
in Sydney (offices and residential flats), will supply
out of its own capital one-quarter of the cost of its
enterprises. The other three-quarters it proposes to
raise by the sale of debentures to the public, the said
debentures to bear 7 p.c. interest. The debenture-
holders, it is announced, “will be protected by a
board of local trustees of highly reputable and re-
sponsible men, who will handle all the funds, and
will, in every way, properly protect the debenture
holder.” It is also stated that “In some eases,
where a guarantee of interest is necessary, the Wil-
liams-Endicott Banking Corporation, Limited, is
prepared to qualify to any Board of Trustees that
will be nominated by the Debenture Holders as to
their full responsibility for such an undertaking.”
The advts. are now signed “J. J. Williams, Govern-
ing Director,” and the first enterprise is to be a
13-storey residential flat in Bligh-street, which,
“for mode of construction and general equipment
challenges criticism” —“will challenge criticism” is
probably meant.
All the Williams-Endicott advertisements which
this paper has been able to find up to
time of writing (which is Tuesday) throw no light,
however, on any of the more important questions
raised in The Bulletin of April 25. No directors’
names are published, nor is the name of the corpora-
tion’s auditor given. Trustees are mentioned in the
rather complicated sentence quoted above (“a board
of local trustees of highly reputable and responsible
men” — Bulletin's italics), but the names of the
responsible trustees don’t appear. Up to time of
writing Endicott doesn’t seem to appear either —not
in print. There is still the same old perplexity
that it should be considered necessary for a com-
pany with £200,000 capital, £160,000 paid up (one
advertisement in Melbourne spoke of the £160,000
as being “issued,” which isn’t necessarily quite
the same thing as “paid up”), to offer so much as
7 p.c. for what is practically preference capital. In
the first place, it is a very large amount to pay
for money which is secured by a 25 p.c. margin on
what purports to be a dead-sure investment, backed
by a company which is “prepared to qualify to any
Board of Trustees” (Bulletin italics again), and
in the second place, it is a large sum to extract as a
regular thing in the shape of net profit, in good times
and bad, out of any building spec., and yet if the
corporation doesn’t earn rather more than that, it
will be taking all the risk for nothing. And, finally,
there is still a certain feeling of .surprise that a new
bank, with £160,000 paid up capital—more than is
possessed by the Ballarat Banking Co., Bank of North
Queensland, or National Bank of Tasmania —should
arrive on the scene with so little information about
its origin, and hang out so unobtrusively in Bull’s
Chambers. A concern of that size generally arrives
with considerable fuss and a long list of names, and
the job of paying up the capital usually attracts
more public attention than it seems to have done in
this case. It strikes this paper as regrettable that
more information is not supplied in the corporation’s
advertisements.

The profits might have loomed somewhat larger, but
£2OOO was transferred to the officers’ provident
fund, and £ 5000 was written off the book value of
premises. The £35,000 which has suddenly leaped
into the reserves is a sum which was set aside in
past years to provide for possible loss on some securi-
ties which weren’t feeling well, and these having
completely recovered, it is no longer wanted. Still,
a time may come when some other securities are
stricken down, and then the bank may wish it had
kept this £35,000 as a dark secret to fall back
upon.

The National of Australasia is another institution
which seems to be unobtrusively taking in a rag or
two of sail in case the weather should change. The
profits are the largest that have been shown since
the year of lamentation (1893), and they even ap-
proach those of the boom days (in 1889, for in-
stance, the declared profits were £166,586, or at the
rate of £83,293 per half-year). But the dividend,
most wisely, is not increased, and it would do no
harm if the bank swore off all increases of that sort
till the reserve fund reaches £1,000,000. The lay-
by is the largest for a very long time. The great in-
crease of advances, commented upon in this paper

liquid assets (also commented upon six months ago
as being on the small side) has been increased by
£349,896. That and the reduction of £276,045 in
liability to note-holders means a notable accession of
strength.

The figures are now very respectable, and they would
probably be still larger but for the fact that the
National, with 214 offices and agencies to maintain,
is one of the wide-spread institutions where expenses
are necessarily heavy. In this respect it is worth
while to look at five Victorian banks —the Ballarat
Banking Co., doing business in one town only; the
Royal with five offices, the Colonial with 111 (in-
cluding agencies in each case) ; the National with
214, and the Commercial of Australia with 243, and
note the result of launching out: —

The very condensed bank finds that its expenses are
less than a fourth of its earnings. The rather less
condensed one finds that they are about one-third.
The other three find that they are more than half —
a great deal more than half in the case of the Com-
mercial, which reaches out furthest of all. It is a
solemn fact that a very sound bank may earn much
less for its shareholders than a very weak one, if the
sound bank covers a very large area for the
size of its business and the weak one works in a very
small space. It was because of this that The
Bulletin urged the Australian Government to buy
up two or three existing institutions as a foundation
for its Commonwealth Bank. By running three or
four businesses from one set of offices, expenses
would be kept down, whereas a widespread Common-
wealth Bank with nothing but the Government con-
nection to start with would represent a lot of im-
mediate expense and a very slowly-growing income. •

This is one of the institutions which walked through
the crisis of 1893 without suspending. It is S.A.’s
one remaining bank, the Town and Country, Com-
mercial of S.A. and Bank of S.A. having all joined
the innumerable caravan of the dead; but it is a
very solid affair, and promises to live long. The fact
that its business is almost entirely confined to one
State, and that the driest State in the Commonwealth
and the one with the least mineral wealth, may be
charged against it as a disadvantage. But the South
Australians are a sturdy lot, who contrive to do
marvels with their unpromising country. And ex-
perience has shown that the bank which labors within
a limited area spends a much smaller proportion of
its earnings in working expenses than the more
widely spread concern, that it can keep a much better
watch on its securities, and that it can concentrate
its cash resources much more rapidly to meet an
emergency.
The figures of the Bank of Adelaide, like those of
some other institutions, tend to show that the boom
is waning. An inefficient tariff, absurdly large im-
ports, insufficient exports of produce owing to a
falling off in the crops, the consequent drain of gold,
and the diminished output of Australian gold mines
are all telling. The following figures are of in-
terest :

The position has really been strengthened, for the
decline in what may be called immediate liabilities
—notes and bills —is greater than that in liquid
assets. But while the bank’s position may be all
right, this general decrease in figures doesn’t suggest
that Australia is all right. At March, 1911, the
figures of the Bank of Adelaide added up to
£6,413,605. At March, 1912, they added up to
£5,819,747. Despite the increase in profits these
totals .suggest that it is time for this institution, like
every other, to take in sail, and the reduction in the
advances- .suggests that a considerable shred of canvas
has been taken off. It implies no 'discredit to the
bank that it should begin to run at diminished pres-
sure. The importing craze, the gold export craze, the
decline in the gold supply and the falling off in the
crops are matters that not even the best managed
financial institution can regulate.

The prospectus of the Central Railway
Palace Buildings, Limited (Sydney), is to hand.
This is a concern with £50,000 nominal capital, in
50,000 shares of £1 each, of which 40,000 are to
be immediately issued and 10,000 held in reserve.
The purpose of the co. is to build, close to Sydney
railway station, a first-class hotel, with 264 bed-
rooms and other appurtenances, also 16 shops in the
basement. The land on which this palace is to rise
is leased from the City Council, not directly by the
company, but by “the Belmore Building Syndicate,”
which is called the vendors. The vendors seem to
be in a good position, for they propose to transfer
the lease, with all the responsibilities attached
thereto, to the co., in return for 5000 ordinary shares
fully paid up and £2500 cash. They are to get
that amount for being intermediaries or middlemen
in the matter of a piece of waste ground, and if
the co. had dealt direct with the City Council it
would evidently have been 5000 shares and £2500
to the good. It looks as if either the co. is to pay
more for the land than it is worth, or the City
Council is getting less than it should do. Of the
40,000 shares to be immediately issued, 5000, as
already mentioned, are to be ordinaries issued to the
vendors (along with their £2500 jn cash). The
other 35,000 are to be preference, entitled to a pre-
ferential cumulative dividend of 8 p.c. That guar-
antee of a dead certain 8 p.c. is fascinating. But
the value of such a preference depends wholly on
the amount of the ordinary capital. Thus: —
In a co. with 140,000 shares, all paid for, of which
35,000 carry a cumulative preference of 8 p.c., it is
only necessary for the co. to earn 2 p.c. to pay the
preference dividend.
If the co. is in 70,000 shares, all paid for, of
which 35,000 carry an 8 p.c. cumulative preference,
it needs to earn 4 p.c., in order to pay the preference
dividend.
If there are 40,000 shares actually issued, and all
paid for, of which 35,000 carry an 8 p.c. cumulative
preference, the said preference isn’t really worth
anything unless the co. can earn 7 p.c.
If the only actual cash capital in the concern is
the £35,000 put up by the preference shareholders
(entitled to 8 p.c. cumulative preference dividend),
then the preference shareholders are simply guaran-
teeing their own dividend, and their only hope is to
earn their own 8 d.c.
If the only actual cash capital is the £35,000 put
up by the preference shareholders (entitled to 8 p.c.
cumulative preferential dividend), and out of that
£2500 has been paid to the vendors, then the pre-
ference shareholders, in addition to guaranteeing
their own dividend, have to earn something over £8
12s. p.c. in order to pay themselves their assured 8
p.c.
The very sanguine calculations re the profits to
be earned by the Central Railway Palace Build-
ings may be quite correct —a good deal probably de-
pends on how long the Sydney railway terminus re-
mains at its present out-of-the-way address. But the
35,000 8 p.c. cumulative preferential shares look
rather like a joke.

The Re-Insurance Company, Limited

1912, and an exceedingly good year it was. Put in

Profits. Dividends. Reserves. Reserves.
Feb., 1912.. £1605 Nil £1605 802
The paid-up capital at the end of February was
£14,656, so in its first year the earnings repre-
sented nearly 11 p.c. Gross premiums were £5793,
and interest on investments amounted to £551. It
is a particularly splendid beginning. The co.’s in-
vestments are all in Government stock and bank de-
posits, and its liabilities are practically nil —£28 in
all. Of course, its reserve of £BO2, after meeting
preliminary expenses, is not quite real, for an insur-
ance co. isn’t actually riding on an even keel until it
has provided a reserve to cover unexpired risks. But
the position is a vast amount better than is usually
shown by a baby office that has just become one year
of age and cut its first tooth.

For four consecutive years the institution with the
long name has paid away more than it has earned.
Presumably, therefore, it doesn’t at present contem-
plate doing any new business, and is merely winding
up. This is the progress of events in recent
yeirs:—

The advances are now described as “balances due on

item is apparently due to the fact that a lot of pro-
perty has lately been, sold on time-payment, as shown
by the reduction in the value placed on estates.

The London Stores, Limited, a trading
concern in the “men’s wear” line, which hangs out at
the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth streets, Mel-
bourne, issues its first report to the end of Febrtiary,
1912. The figures cover a period of about nine
months. The co. has a paid-up capital of £70,000,
and sundry assets which arouse a spirit of earnest in-
quiry. These are-r
Building alterations .. £9,400 2 6
Preliminary expenses . . 2,309 2 8
Goodwill .. .. .. 16,659 0 0
£28,368 5 2
That is a good deal of dead weight for a £70,000
company to carry. Another asset is described as
“Rent Suspense Account, £1666.” There being no.
explanation as to what rent this is, where)
it is suspended, why it is suspended, how,
high it is suspended, and when it is likelyl
to dfop ; from its present position into . the|
cash box, it is impossible to pass judgment on this
item. It is given the benefit of the doubt, pending
further information. Leaving it out of consideration,
The Bulletin estimates the case in this fashion: —
In Reduction
Feb., Profits. Dividends. of Sh rtage. Deficit.
1912.. £7293 8 p.c. =£4200 £3093 £25,275
Or, as the balance-sheet puts it, £575 is written
off preliminary expenses, and nothing off goodwill or
“building alterations,” leaving the paper items
standing at £27,793. And on the other side is a
special reserve of £1536; an ordinary reserve of
£518; and £464 undivided profit. Total, £2518,
and £2518 from £27,793 = £25,275. If the Rent
Suspense Account doesn’t prove realisable, things are
not so good as this.
In one respect affairs don’t, seem quite so favorable
as shown above. Apparently, the co. had control for
two or three months (February 1 to June 8) before
the accounts were adjusted and the business was
formally taken over. It seems to have paid by
agreement a lump sum of £3OOO for the profits of
this period, and as the profits were £4536, it started,
so far as can be made out, with a windfall of £1536
—the special reserve mentioned above —which is in-
cluded in the nine months’ profits shown above. That
reduces the actual profits of the nine months to
£5757, and the earnings available to shift the de-
ficit to £1557. Considering the size of the dead
horse this is very little, and the 8 p.c. dividend looks
excessive. The company, apparently, doesn’t own
the building—at least nothing of the sort appears
among the assets. Whether the visible assets
are worth their book value, or less or more,
depends, of course, on the accuracy of the
stocktaking and the sufficiency of the allow-
ance for bad debts. The co. has abundance of loose
change to go on with, having no less than £14,728
in the bank, and it starts with the good habit of
carrying 10 p.c. of its profits to reserve fund. It is
only a pity it isn’t a larger habit.

An ambitious prospectus has been circu-
lated by the Globe Motor and Taxi Co. in Melbourne,
asking for subscriptions for 25,000 £1 shares. The
promoters—Messrs. Renowden, Archbold and Co.—
are to get 8500 shares and £4700 in cash for three
businesses, for which no statements of actual pro-
fits are given. There is certainly an estimate that
gross profits may reach £24,250, and net profits
£11,250. No data is afforded the investor looking
for something safe for his money. The agencies to
be transferred by the vendors are the Berna lorries,
Unic taxi-cabs, and N.S.U. cycles. The proposed
company will do altogether 14 different kinds of
business, from repairing motor-cars to insuring
them. Also, so “soon as electric cars are proved
to be reliable,” the new co. will introduce them.
The framer of the prospectus is evidently unaware
that in other countries the electric car is making
solid progress, because it does not need an expert
mechanic to handle it, and is, therefore, totally fool-
proof. The directorate comprises two knights
(Weedon and Peacock) and an alderman.

The wealth of this gigantic beer factory threatens
to grow unwieldy. It has £398,177 of investments
and cash, which represents in itself nearly two-fifths of
the capital ( £1,000,000). Nowadays the co. disguises
its reserves in all sorts of ways. It has an ordinary
reserve fund of £100,000; a reserve of £55,000 for
the equalisation of dividends, though when the earn-
ings represent £24 17s. 7d. p.c. per annum on capi-
tal, and the dividend is only 10 p.c., the cold day
when it will be necessary to draw on reserves to
keep the dividend going, seems very remote. Then
there is a reserve of £200,000 for re-building (it
isn’t stated what is to be re-built), and depreciation
of securities. Yet, when there is £74,403 left in
a single half-year after paying a 10 p.c. div., both
the re-building and the depreciation seem fairly well
provided for. Comparing the present situation with
that of 10 years back, these are the results:—

A year and a half ago Tooth and Co. converted
£lOO,OOO of reserves into capital, and now it pro-
poses to repeat the process. Every holder of 10
shares will receive one share as a present. Then the
paid up capital will be £1,100,000; the 10 p.c. divi-
dend will amount to £llO,OOO per annum ; and the
reserves will' stand at £339,883 —until next half-
year’s profit bumps them up again. Of course, such
a gigantic pot of honey can’t help having an occas-
ional fly or two in it. The local option movement
and the spread of teetotalism is one, but probably it
is the smallest one. So many people earn money or
advertisement by denouncing drink, and would sink
out of sight if drink were abolished, or even seriously
diminished, that the trade lives to some extent on its
enemies. The great danger is that the tied house
system may be abolished and brewery companies be
no longer allowed to own hotels. Then the enfran-
chised publican, yearning to secure the manufac-
turers’ profits for himself, may dot the State with
co-operative breweries, and give rise to a dreadful
hole in the business of the old beer firms. Therefore,
the Tooth company does well to make hops while the
sun shines, for the sun looks too wonderful to be
wholly permanent.

There is also a marine insurance fund of £552. If
this is included in the reserves the total reaches
£7254. Perhaps it should be included, for it
seems to be a continually increasing fund. Once in
recent years a sum was carried to it from profits,
but mostly it grows a little in a quiet, unexplained
sort of way. The addition to it last year was £52.
The gross earnings for 1911 were £2238 more than
in 1910, but expenses (including allowance for de-
preciation) increased by considerably more, and the
net profits are reduced. They are reduced so much,
in fact, as to make the 10 p.c. dividend look a verv
doubtful proposition. For a company with £74,682
of capital, and £57,992 owing under the head of
“sundry creditors, including bank overdraft and
bills payable”—amount of overdraft not stated —the
reserve of £6702 is very small. A year ago the sum
owing under the three-barrelled heading was only
£45,766, so the increase is £12,226. The balance-
sheet ought certainly to state how much the over-
draft is, and how fast it is increasing. At the end
of 1909 Paul and Gray owed their bankers £17,797,
and overdraft, sundry creditors and bills payable then
added up to £34,502. That was the last time the
overdraft appeared separately, but the combined
items, as already mentioned, rose in 1910 to £45,766,
and in 1911 to £57,992, while the net profits have
diminished. Another regrettable feature is that the
accounts lump freehold and leasehold property to-
gether.
In a general way this is the position:—

Apparently the growth of the expenses has attracted
the attention of the directors, and it is stated:
“Some special items included in the year, and which
are considered to be no longer necessary, are being
discontinued.”

A new Sydney enterprise is the Cumber-
land Paper Board Mills, Ltd., with a capital of
£50,000, to manufacture paper boards of various
varieties. A water frontage site has been obtained
on the Upper Lane Cove River, and mills are now in
the course of erection to accommodate the most up-
to-date machinery that can be purchased on the
world’s market —Australia being a place which, for
want of adequate Protection, doesn’t make its own
machinery. The directors are: Robert Sands (chair-
man), Alexander Moir, R. S. Sands, Johnston Tait,
and J. M. Jefferson, and amongst the shareholders
are the names of very prominent business people who
are connected with the printing and box-making' in-
dustries. The registered office is at 374 George-
street, Sydney.
The Sun Newspaper Co., Limited (Syd-
ney) concluded its second year on March 81. The
two balance-sheets are distinctly intricate. This, to
begin with, is how affairs look on the surface (but
there are a lot of things to be said after that): —

That looks very simple, but there are other consid-
erations. The Sun Co. started by buying the assets
of the old Australian Newspaper Co. for £28,000.
It valued them at £31,132 Is: Id., which left a

there was some semblance of that about the business
—of £3132 Is. Id. Also, there appeared in the
first balance-sheet an item described as “reserve for
trade discounts and doubtful debts, £2754 10s. 4d.
Where this fund came from isn t stated, but
there was nothing to show that it was pro-
vided out of the new company’s earnings, and
if it was something left over from the old co.
the new co. set out with nominal reserves of £5886.
Against the first item ( £3132) was charged “Cost
establishing the business, preliminary expenses, and
loss on trading from April to October, 1910, £2920
15s lOd.” Thus the year was divided into two sec-
tions, and the loss on the first section was charged
against the reserve; the profit shown (£858)
belonged to the second section. This loss
left £2ll odd out of the original reserve of £3132,
and that £2ll was used later on to help to provide
for depreciation. Also, the reserve for trade , dis-
counts and doubtful debts ( £2754 10s. 4d.) disap-
peared between the dates of the two balance-sheets.
By way of a further entanglement, no directors fees
were charged against the first year, and two years
fees were charged against the second. On the other
hand the co. issued some new shares during the year
—it changed from a co. of 50,000 £1 shares
( £24,950 paid up) to one of 100,000 £1 shares
( £48,000 paid up). Apparently the new shares
were issued at a premium, for there appears in the
latest balance-sheet an item —apparently intended as
a reserve —“Share premium account, £5773.
So the table of figures may be reconstructed thus,
charging each year with half the directors’ fees and
deducting depreciation from the profits:—-

1910 £5886

(Premiums on new shares, £5773) 8150
Profits
Less
Depreciation.
1912 .. 1656 £2754 7052
Apart from “Share premium account, £5773,” the
reserves are thus £1279. The first year, being a
preliminary sort of period, may, however, be disre-
garded. Assuming that the £2754 odd reserved
against doubtful debts, etc., went to cover liabilities
incurred prior to March 31, 1911, then the net
profit for last year was £1656 —always on the
understanding that depreciation and bad debts were
sufficiently provided for, and 5 p.c. written off plant
and machinery looks scanty. If any part of the
doubtful debts reserve went to cover liabilities in-
curred between 31/3/’ll and 31/3/’l2, then the
profit is less, but it is impossible to say how much
less. Anyhow the £1656 represents a moderate £3
9s. p.c. on the paid-up capital of £48,000. During
the year liabilities have been reduced by £26,280,
doubtless owing to the £28,823 of new capital and
share premiums, and the cash on hand has increased
by £6Bl. Liabilities, apart from a mortgage of
£16,000 on the building, only amount to a trifle —
£2054 of trade debts, and the co. has £11,422
owing to it, and £1592 cash.

This vigorous young concern is doing well, having
wiped out all preliminary and establishment expenses
--these were the cause of the first year’s deficit —
paid a dividend and bonus, and laid the foundations
of a reserve fund. But it could certainly do with
more capital. It has £19,803 paid up, and as its
land, buildings, etc., represent £38,883, it is natur-
ally in debt. In fact, it is a splendidly healthy in-

This co. has been running factories at Warwick and
Allora, and has just completed another at Texas.
For the past half-year nothing is written off against
depreciation, “as the accounts now stand con-
siderably below the most reasonable valuation ; so
rthe total profit is carried forward “with the object
of providing a substantial bonus at the end of the
ihalf-year.” But whether depreciation is written off
■or not, there actually was wear and tear; and it
mothing is written off or put by for future renewals,
ietc., it simply means that an amount will be dis-
fWfbuted in excess of the true net profits. Otherwise
the co. appears to be wisely managed; and the posi-
tion is sound and the accounts are very well pre-
sented indeed.

Last year N.S.W. produced 75,104 tons of
kerosene shale, worth £36,910. These figures are
ahead of those for 1911, and the shale industry, if
carefully handled, will flourish. The Bntish-Aus-
tralian Oil Co., at Murrurundi (N.S.W.), has got its
brand of kerosene oil on the market, and its output,
including quite a number of by-products, is meeting
with a good reception. # *
New Zealand Hill (Foster, Vic.) is to
have the hose turned on to it at last. There awaits
to be attacked a big body of alluvial drift. This
defied the old miner, because he couldn t run water
up hill. Now a dry dredger is to churn up the
waste in the face, and elevate the drift into sluice-
boxes. Thus a mining puzzle promises to be solved
in a district that has haunted the minds of many of
the hatters who have knocked round the outskirts of
Stockyard Creek. * # *
Dividends, £788,640! Thus ends the Long
Tunnel Extended (Walhalla, Vic.), which now lies
moribund beside the other heroes that have passed
away in the solitudes of Gippsland. Fully £B2 3s.
per share dropped into the pockets of those of the
old brigade who, like Peter Finlayson, stuck to the
grand old mine from the early days of its brief call-
making stage. Nothing can well be more mournful
than the last days of this magnificent orifice. First
Mason, the mainspring of the old Board, went, T hen
Dick Noble gave up the management to try other
climes, leaving Peter Finlayson to enter up closing
records in the family bible of the company. '1 he
Bulletin often chided Propsting and his directors
for not grabbing the Long Tunnel, and for not see-
ing that the lode was underlying steadily out of their
claim into the Long Tunnel western ground. But
honest loyalty—wrong-headed if you like —is better
in mining than the shiftiness of the average director.
For that reason The Bulletin deplores that Prop-
sting’s effort to induce Bewick, Moreing and Co. to
poke out a crosscut to the last, fell through. The
final stage will be a distribution of 2s. 6d. out of the
bit that comes back from the sale of the plant to the
machinery man. Many an old maid and widow de-
plore the passing out of the old dividend-payer.

Victorian mines don’t make up lost ground.
For the past quarter only 116,8200 z. came from
them, the backward drift for the three months being
12,7980 z. This means that call-paying folk are
tired of doing the battledore-shuttlecock game, and
never raking in a prize. Moreover, they want more
divs., to cover up Stock Exchange losses.
Good yields have lately been got from
Kundip shows at Phillips River (W.A.). One party
on the Harbor View obtained 1250 z. from 111 tons.
Another had a good clean up at the Western Gem,
and is shipping its concentrates, which are heavy in
copper and gold, to Port Kembla. A third recovered
about lOOoz. from 112 tons. The Gem battery is
now crushing between 300 and 400 tons, which is
expected to give a full oz. yield.
Why do the Mint and Mines Department
gold returns differ so much in Westralia? Ihe
former’s total for 1911 is 31,881 fine oz. ahead of the
latter’s. As usual, it is suggested that the Mint is
being made a convenience of by illicit gold receivers.
There may be a little in this, but numbers of claim-
holders who send gold to the Mint wouldn’t walk
across the street to acquaint the Mines Department
of the fact, and probably this in a large measure
accounts for the discrepancy between the two re-
turns. The discrepancy has now become chronic. As
a remedy, the man who sells gold to the Mint might
be sent to the Mines Department with a receipt to
collect his money, and the Mines Department might
give him a free drink.
* * * *
The demonstration of the worth or worth-
lessness of Bullfinch (W.A.) as a gold mine is further
postponed on account of the delay in the delivery of
ore treatment machinery ordered at “’Ome. Por-
tion ' of this has not even been made yet, and the
chances are that the long-promised plant, which
some callous pessimists aver will wring the birdls
neck when it gets a move on, will not be ready to
start until the end of the year, or perhaps later.
No payable ore has yet been discovered at the No. o
level and in the absence of corroborative evidence
from an independent expert, the story about the co.
having a new mine in the “northern series is taken
with a whole cellarful of salt.
* * * *
Comet Vale (W.A.), where Lionel Robin-
son and some pals are spending a few thousands on
options, produced 11,1290 z. of gold in 1911, or
nearly double what it yielded in 1910. The output
for the current year is expected to show a still
greater increase, and if, as anticipated, the Sand
Queen, Gladstone, and one or two other leases are
floated off in London, and worked at high pressure,
it should soar much higher later on.
* i * * *
Mountain Queen (W.A.) reports for the
financial year recently ended that the expenditure
upon plant amounted to £12,020; upon development,
£7501; and general expenses, £2784. Co. still has
a bit of money in hand, but unless it can get re-
turns nearer the 335. valuation placed upon its ore
by 8., M. and Co., its case is hopeless. Even if the
worst happens, however, the public won’t lose much,
as the underwriters hold most of the shares.*
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) announces that
90ft. of driving along the recaptured Boulder lode,
at the 2630 ft. level, has exposed ore showing tellur-
ide and free gold. Other good developments are
likely to follow as the opening up of this region
proceeds, but, as emphasised some time ago, it will
be a year or two yet before the Horseshoe is able to
get at this richer ore and derive any material benefit
from its treatment.
* * *
Sand Queen (W.A.) showed a net profit
last vear of £6490, and out of this surplus three
dividends, absorbing £3OOO were paid. Since the
beginning of the current year £8747 has been re-
covered, and a further £3OOO has been distributed
among shareholders, leaving a substantial credit bal
ance in the bank. Another dividend is promised m
May, and after that monthly distributions are ex-
pected. # *
Greenfinch (W.A.) had its first clean up
at Weston’s the other day, when 850 tons averaged
365. 3d., with 14s. in the tailings. _ The ore crushed
was chiefly from development, and included 300 tons,
which was thrown on one side when a picked parcel
was sent to Kalgoorlie for treatment.

These figures are only given for what they are worth,
as in the past Westralian estimates of reserves have
been notoriously inaccurate. * #
As predicted, the Ida H. (W.A.) is not
fulfilling official expectations. About a year ago,
when a rich patch was being worked and the Board
was busy telling shareholders to look out for monthly
dividends, a very grave doubt was expressed on this
page about the show’s staying powers, and develop-
ments at the next (No. 11) level, shows this opinion
to have been Tustified. At this depth the co. wi
be lucky if it opens up 100 ft. of ore, and luckier still
if values average 60s. for the Present uniform widt
of 4ft. This certainly looks better than nothin,, on
paper, but with working costs in the vicmity of 40s
and development averaging close on £8 a foot, the
co can’t, at present, show any real profit on the
treatment of 70s. ore. And when the stopes giving
this average are exhausted, in about four or five
months’ time, it will have to think over J**"^ 5 * Tl ?®
latest estimate of ore reserves gives the tonnage in
sight as 15,000 tons, worth 635. per ton, but this
ore may just as well be candle-grease for all t e
benefit shareholders are likely to get out of it. A
big row, which may terminate m another change of
management, is now taking place at Ome.
Apparently little reliance can be placed
nowadays in what is officially said in London about
the Sons of Gwalia. Last November the Board issued
a circular containing the definite announcement that
the mine never looked better nor in a stronger posi-
tion. The staggered management induced the Board
to issue another report, intimating that, owing to
the higher grade ore being drawn on too heavily, etc.,
the monthly output would have to come down and
quarterly dividends be reduced to Is. Since then
profits have been insufficient to provide even for this
pared-down distribution, and as the recoverable
grade of the ore treated is still shrinking, the posi-
tion is going from bad to worse. Yet the market is
improving a little. Why doesn’t the co. show its
hand, and be done with it ?

Papuan, Brilliant and Victoria (Charters
Towers) are battling along with the Papuan and
Moonstone leases. From the former lease tributors
squeezed in a crushing of 82 tons for 184 oz. gold.
The Moonstone has been holding out promise of get-
ting on to something, and an additional 12 acres
have been taken up to cover the deeper ground to
the south-east. Revenue account for the half-year
shows a loss of £782, of which depreciation on the
leases is responsible for £lBO. There is £303 of
the Government subsidy yet to run, in addition to
£lllO balance at the bank.

“Mallarapoonie” : Dropped in at the Blair
Athol Coal Co.’s pit (Central Queensland) the other
day. This co. is doing creditable work, and de-
serves the horny hand of partisanship being pushed in
its direction. Haulage of carbon increases steadily
in proportion as the headings go in, but industrial
centres are 240 miles away, and freight is a ravenous
animal. But the seam is well worth while, and the
figures of its dimensions read like a fairy tale. Out-
put has been somewhat as follows since the pit began
tipping, on April 25, 1910: —
l9lO .. .. .. 35,753 tons.
1911 67,248 „
1912, Jan. (approx.) .. 6,000 ~
1912, Feb
1912, Mar. (approx.) .. 8,000 „
The month of P'ebruary was comparatively a vacancy,
or excavation, or blank, owing to the Badger strike.
But, notwithstanding Badger, Expectation probably
won’t require to stand on tip-toe to see this new
colliery touch the 100,000-ton mark this year. No.
1 tunnel (200yds., 1 in 5 grade) has gone to the coal
body at water level, giving 45ft. of black substance
overhead, and 25ft. underfoot. Face of north head-
ing is in over the 400yds. mark, and still being
steadily extended in coal of unchanged quality. When
the world is older, and its baby more grown up, the
overhead coal will be broken down, and great will
be the fall thereof. Meantime, a very safe bord-and-
pillar system is in vogue. Electric power is sup-
plied by twin (250 volt) generators, driving Jeffray
and Sullivan coal-cutters, boring machines and pump.
Steam: 160-h.p. winder, coupled to the almost uni-
versal Babcock. Short-lived as the pit yet is,
it has not been free from the demon Fire. Some
brick stoppings, promptly applied, however, blighted
the animal’s fresh young life.
At No. 2 pit, 14 miles north, the drive is in
500 ft. on a 1 in 5 grade. Main seam was entered at
454 ft. ; coal of similar quality to, if not better than,
No. 1. In fact, as regards dimension of seam and
quality of coal, this pit promises even better than
No. 1. Coalmining at Blair Athol, however, is no
new thing. Some of the gloomy material was dug
out as long ago as 1866, by the old Peak Down
Copper Proprietary. Coal seam on this co.’s prop-
erty, acquired by present Blair Athol Co., is 62ft.
thick, without band or blemish, and may be entered
at an average vertical depth of 65ft. from surface.
A system of mining by open cut has been mooted,
but turned down as being impracticable. One au-
thority (probablv an unreliable one) estimates re-
serves at from 15 to 20 million tons proved. Inci-
dentally, it would be interesting to know what com-
plication of circumstances led to this gigantic seam
of high-grade coal, 63ft. thick, and without fault
or clav-band, being laid on the floor of a rocky basin
onlv 145 ft. beneath the surface. Evidently, Aus-
tralia could grow luxuriant whiskers (or peat) in its
young days.
Brilliant Deeps (Charters Towers) is
crushing stone obtained in development. The return
will give some idea of the reef above No. 4 level, for
most of the stone has come from the rise which is
70ft. above No. 4, and in the heart of the payable
shoot of stone west of the crosscut. There is 2ft. of
good stone in the face. A small shaft is being sunk
from No. 2 level crosscut, a-nd when the reef is met
with it will be followed on its underlay to connect
with the rise. About 250 ft. of the reef, in a ver-
tical direction between No. 4 and No. 2, will be pro-
spected in doing this work. The winze below No. 4
level was started at the eastern extremity of the shoot
of stone developed in No. 4 level. This winze is now
down 70ft., and during the last few feet of sinking,
stone of improved quality has been met with, but
the failure of No. 5 level crosscut to locate anything
makes prospects at depth uncertain. No. 4 had to
cover some 300 ft. of barren ground before payable
stone was struck ; so looking at the. position of the
winze and its depth below No. 4, it is qufte possible
that a development of some consequence will occur m
No. 5. * *
* * *
Bonnie Dundee (Charters Towers) is de-
veloping the 609 ft. formation with moderate success.
The last crushing of 323 tons gave an average return
of £4 3s. 3d., which, considering the time it took
to raise the stone, isn’t much better than payable.
Five levels have been opened. No. 3 level is in 240tt.
north-west, the face showing a split reef divided by
formation, each vein carrying from Bm. to 10m. ot
fair grade stone. . #
Tasmania produced 3955 tons of tin oxide
and metal last year, valued at £53:1,50°. Copper
came into second place, with a value of £408,651.
Strikes accounted for the reduced output. Tassy is
rich in lead ore, but only 61,509 tons were produced,
valued at £253,361. The smelting works at Aee-
han can make very close recoveries of gold, silver
and lead, and the bullion shipped is rich in precious
metals. The Hercules mine (Mount Read) is a
good support to the local smelter, for it makes s ip-
ments of about 600 tons of lead sulphides to Zeehan
every week. There has been a good development in
the east lode, which is showing a width of 16ft of
pavable ore. Reserves are estimated at over 400,000
tons, in proportion to which the output is small.
Mount. Bischoff reckons 3,000,000 tons of low-grade
tin ore. but raises less than 250,000 tons a year.
North Lvell estimates its reserves at 1.000.000 tons
of 6 p.c. ore, but the output doesn’t exceed 130,000
tons a year, even in peaceful times.
* * * *
The Hercules (Tas.) had a credit balance
of £33,446 on Januarv 31,1912. Shipments of lead
sulphides onlv started last July, so the production ot
lead ore—averaging 2143 tons per month—covers a
period of seven months. The assay was 3.64dwt.
gold, 11.150 z. silver, and 9.52 p.c. lead, so if fair
recoveries are made, the lead bullion should be rich
in precious metals. During the year, 5522 tons of
zinc ore were exported to Europe. This averaged
40 p.c. zinc and small quantities of gold and silver.
Reserves are estimated at 423,375 tons, a very large
quantity compared with 22,254 tons raised during
the year. , * *

With the aid of the Scotch dredges, more drift has
been shifted in the six months than in any previous
half-year. The eo., on top of a larger output, had
a splendid market for tin, the average price panning
out at £lO7 per ton of oxide, as against £lO3 per
ton for the preceding term. The want in the com-
parison is the cost of tin-getting, but Teddy Miles,
Jones and Co. won't cough up details of that sort
until the year’s balance is struck. The record is an
eye-opener to the Melbourne experts, who tilted up
thumbs against the show.

Sungei Raia tin, an Asiatic claim, came
out flashily on the shaded side of Collins-streei
a summer or two back. But it is now up against
disappointment, in that the rich returns of the past
have to be regarded as a memory. Boring ahead of
the barge has convinced the manager that not only
has the rich ground been sluiced out, but that ahead,
clay and cement prevent profits being won on the old
claim. This means a jump to a new lease, where-
lilb. tin drift awaits the coolie. Out of this and
out of the cheap Chow worker the white man of Aus-
tralia hopes to snick in more divs. He is lucky to
hit on tin at £2OO a ton to help him tide over the
wait that will take place before his new vineyard
can be tilled.

“Will the undertaking pav?” The economical
handling and transport of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,
merchandise, etc., in or about mines, factories or
warehouses, very often solves the problem. W. and
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, as agents for Bleichert
and Co., can give useful information on this subject.
The Bleichert firm has several aerial ropeways work-
irg in Australia, or in course of erection, and will
soon have at work, near Sydney, one of the largest
electric “Telpher” plants in existence. Special
electric and other cranes and mono-rail conveyors
can be procured from the same firm.*

The undisputed benefit of asbestos covering for
steam-pipes and boilers has been exemplified by a re-
cent scientific treatise of the principles of steam
conveyance. Tests made have established the fact
that 100 square feet of pipe covered with this
material, at a pressure of 2001 b. per square inch, and
coal at 16s, per ton, will save £7 per year, ana
prevent loss of pressure equal to 13.84 B. Th. U. per
square foot per minute. Bell's Asbestos Non-con-
ducting Composition, supplied in ewt. bags, or

After considerable discussion on the advantages and
disadvantages of the mechanical stonebreaking as
against the handbreaking, the Bacchus Marsh Shire
Council (Vic.) decided in favor of the mechanical
method, and, on comparing the various makes of
machine, decided that the one most suited to their
needs was the Bigelow Patent Stone Crusher. They
purchased a 16in. x 9in. portable machine, and from
their engineer’s various reports on the matter they
are more than satisfied with it.
From June to September the Council crushed and
spread 3000 cub. yards of road metal at an average
cost of 2/6 per cub. yard; and the cost of spalls per
cub. yard averaged 2/4, making a total cost of 4/10
per cub. yard broken and spread. Their last con-
tract under the hand-breaking system amounted to
6/3 per cub. yard, stacked on the roadside, and
spreading 1/-; total 7/3, as against the 4/10 of the
mechanical system. Saving, 2/5 per cub. yard. Thefle
figures speak for themselves to those interested in
the matter.
The Bigelow breakers, which are also largely used
by the mining companies of Australia, are manu-
factured by the Austral Otis Engineering Company,
South Melbourne, who will be glad to answer en-
quiries.* [3

Extract from the Financial News, London
(29/8/1910) : “A young Life Office has many difficul-
ties to contend against, and in its early years the
progress of its business must be comparatively slow;
rapid growth can only be expected when a certain
amount of success has already been attained and the
business on the books has reached a total of some
magnitude. To this general rule the Colonial Mutual
is certainly a striking exception. From the outset
the society has been remarkably successful in obtain-
ing business, and its rise to a position of eminence
has been exceptionally rapid.*

A chemist has to listen to
other people’s troubles all day
long, and sometimes half the
night, too —it’s pretty trying,
and one gets very weary of it, l
can tell you—and sometimes l get
so run down that 1 go right off
my food, and the only thing 1
can touch is a cup of tea.
Now, provided tea is pure, and
not overdrawn in the making, it
is about as good a thing as you
can take when you feel very tired,
and there’s cettainly nothing that
you can drink with your meals
that’s nicer or better for you—
tea’s much better even than fresh
water, because to make tea the
water must be boiled, which kills
all the germs in it whereas,
when you drink plain water you
swallow the germs alive. Robur
is the purest tea that can be got,
and I can recommend the No. 1
Grade —it really is wonderfully
nice tea.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, April 29, 1912.
My Dear Arini, —
Someone lias remarked that there is no-
thing new to be said of Bonaparte the First,
except a hazardous tale that he discovered
appendicitis and died before he had time to
make it fashionable. But a book called
“The Youth of Napoleon”-—a recent up-
heaval —has re-dressed the little corporal’s
early bones in a reasonably fresh surtout of
family correspondence. Mamma Bona-
parte, writing to son Napoleon—at that time
buckling on his war-paint in Lombardy—
wails over the servant-girl problem, which
was then smiting Corsica, though, perhaps,
not with the same severity noticed in its
whirligig through this continent.
“I must remind you,” savs Mrs. Charles
8., “that the death of your father has greatly
straitened our circumstances, and it will be
necessary for you to be very economical. As
you are soon to return home, I would like
you to bring me a general servant. They are
most difficult to get here. Plain cooking.
No washing. As for wages, perhaps three
or four francs a month. But for a very
capable woman I would not mind giving an
extra 20 sous.” Napoleon had the same
luck when he stalked a handmaiden as he
had when he chased a crown. The general
servant Bony commandeered for his mother
stayed with that thrifty lady till her son
wore a gold hat and a red velvet tail trimmed
with courtiers. “Plain cooking, no washing”
is another memorial to the mighty Nap.
When one comes to think of it, the great
emperor must have done a lot in his time to
solve the Mary Anne problem, though the
effect couldn’t, in the nature of things, be
lasting. He was the greatest manufacturer
of widows that Europe had seen for cen-
turies, and a large proportion of them must
have been available for kitchen employment.
Probably his last really great smash, the
Battle of the Nations, supplied Europe with
30,000 domestic servants.
Governor Chelmsford broke the flag, and
cheers were given for the eminent navigator
Cook (see daily press) at Ivurnell the other
day. Cook has been too long underground
to turn in his sleep when Botany Bay makes
glad noises over his memory. But the joyous
flag-flapping at Ivurnell was in line with
Australian sentiment. James Cook, follow-
ing on the track of a hundred other explor-
ers, raised the British flag hereabouts. Other
flags had been raised before, but the British
Government followed this matter up, whereas
other Governments didn’t, so it was this
flag-hoisting that really signified. Britain
smudged the land with a broad arrow. A
free people obliterated the arrow, or burnt
it, or something. Cook’s Day is a better
day to serve up with bunting and cham-
pagne than the date (January 26) which
commemorates the arrival of England’s pick-
pockets and other light-fingered gentry.
A visitor who recently floated along from
Port Moresby tells me the Lost Tribe is
found thereabouts for the hundredth time of
finding. Generally speaking, any member of
it will rush the roast pig (which is a sign
of deterioration, but then paschal lamb
doesn’t grow in Papua), but his front name
is almost invariably Hosea or Moses (cut
down to Hosi and Mosi), which is strong
evidence of his Palestinian origin. His
hinder name, sad to say, is generally Kuku-
Kuku, but that is no argument against the
Lost Tribe theory. In Germany many of
the race became Rosenbloom or Guggenheim,
and Kuku-Ivuku is no more unexpected-look-
ing than these. It seems to me that a black
Israelite who had run wild in Papua might
come, in course of time, to be named almost
anything— or almost everything for that
matter. Kuku-Ivuku I assume to be a vari-
ation of the name of a well-known bird, the
real designation of our new friend being
Moses Cockatoo. This may possibly signify
that he fled all the way from Galilee to the
Fly River and went on the land —became,
in fact, Moses the Cocky. He has a Hebrew
profile and a genius for trade, and it is a
sign of this same genius that he refuses all
information about how he left Bashan and
similar parts. Doubtless he is waiting to
be paid for the news.
Miss Tait, who is superintendent of native
hospitals in Papua and adjacent isles, looked
in here the other day. She is a trained
nurse, with a taste for tropic parts, and,
when she has swallowed the end of her fur-
lough, she’ll trundle back to Moresby in a
Dutch packet. Speaking for herself, the
Lady of the Island Lamp finds that a sense
of. humor and no fear of a burnt sienna
skin are a mighty help to the woman who
sets out to nurse Fuzz-Wuzz and Co. in
lonely camp hospitals. The colored heathen,
however, semes to hang something that’s
rather like a halo on the head of the white
woman who incidentally drags him back to
his favorite occupation of sooling his brown
lady on to any hard labor that happens to
be handy. Miss Tait admils that she once
felt uncommonly wide awake in the middle
of the night.
“I’d camped in a native hut—just a plat-
form, bunk and roof —on the banks of a
river, on my way to an outlying hospital,”
says the Healeress. “One bustles to get in-
side a mosquito net at sunset under those
circumstances, and my house boy, who was
my only companion, had just tucked me in
for the night when two canoe-loads of war-
like natives landed. They rushed up to the
hut, which was quite open, of course, and
yes—l fancy they did approach my mos-
quito net with threatening language. ‘The
hut was theirs—the white woman must go
out of it.’ My boy’s argument was,
that the hut might belong to the canoe party,
but the white mistress would not budge out
of her mosquito net.” After interminable
talk, the boy sat like a stone image under
the Healing Lady’s agitated bunk, while the
Forty Thieves—who were dressed in dogs’
teeth necklets —discussed the lady and the
situation till daylight. There wasn’t one
wink of sleep amongst those present. Miss
Tait, in her spare moments, sits at the
skirts of Beatrice Grimshaw, whose residen-
tial hut and fountain pen are leading fea-
tures of the Port Moresby landscape, and she
mentions Governor Murray as one of the
best-liked men between Papua and the Sun-
set.
The Women’s Patriotic Club, or League,
is said to be tearing round in the track of
cream puffs and devilled ices, in order to
welcome the Joseph Ward trio when it
bounds into this settlement. From Sydney
the Ward triangle will go on to Brisbane,
where the Great Smite fell down dead a few
weeks ago.
Major Harry Potter, of the Maoriland
Defence Force, who has been taking degrees
in gunnery, King’s regulations, polo ponies,
etc., in India (why should there not be a
Doctor of Gunnery?), returns shortly to his
native geysers. He is an Auckland native, and
once followed the peaceful calling of chemist.
But he was caught in the S’African squabble,
and took to the sword as a permanent occu-
pation. Potter acted as adjutant of the
Canterbury Plains, etc., etc.
The highly-protected M.L. kiwi (which
lost its wings in some ancient evolutionary
fray) can’t be removed from the Island
Dominion under fearful pains and penalties.
An English tourist named Turner-Turner,
probably unaware that he might be flung into
a cauldron of hot mud or parboiled in a
spring for his trouble, got away to this city
with four astonished kiwis. These surprised
birds were identified as aliens, unable to read
German or sing in a Greek chorus. They
were promptly arrested by E. H. Mont-
gomery (of the M.L. Government Agency),
and packed off to their domestic perch before
they had time to dust their feathers.
What is a Burma head? A man who’s
been out in the rubber-tyred parts for some
years tells me that it is a special kind of
memory haze, if you get it badly. A Burma
head mixes up dates and can’t remember whe-
ther the owner of the head played golf on
the Rangoon club links yesterday, or last
week, or next Friday, or the middle of a
fortnight before last month. When a Burma
head really develops in European brains, I
suppose it fills them with pagodas full of
spiders and cobwebs. Anyhow, there’s only
one remedy—a long holiday. Even a Burma
head can remember the right way to an out-
going steamer. The plain European head, I
am told, is a different thing, yet very simi-
lar. It can’t remember how it got home the
previous night, so it is also a matter of lost
memory.
Robert Herrick’s new book, “The Healer”
(Roycrott Library), is a sly thrust at the
modern fashionable doctor who slices up
humanity, for a handsome consideration, and
watches, with sleek content, his wife’s
career as a sub-leader of social clatter. But
Herrick lacks conviction in the sketch of the
ideal Plealer—the doctor who loves his pro-
fession and cares nothing for fees. This
means a rough camp for the pretty young
wife on the blue rim of a remote American
lake, and contains all the meat of a delight-
ful romance. But the bones on which the
meat is hung are dry. Holden the Healer
is a boor and an egotist. He has the rough
strength of Jane Eyre’s Rochester (or Miss
Mix’s Rawjfester), without the charm of that
virile person, who, in Bret Harte’s version,
tied the poker absent-mindedly into knots,
and entered the drawing-room via the chim-
ney. Herrick calls him the Wild One, but
he s a tame kind of unmannerly beast. An
ass, an idealist, and a Mad Hatter make the
component parts of this new hero of ro-
mance. His wife found the tinkle of sub-
urban teacups a hapnv release from unal-
loyed Healer in the Wilderness.
Count Perretti de la Rocca, who used to
adorn the tea tables of society in this city
as a popular pet, afterwards drifted off to
Panama as Consul. He took to sea bathing
with fatal results a few months ago. An
angry breaker swept poor de la Rocca off to
Eternity, and I hope he has drifted into a
calm haven in the Jasper Sea.
Somewhere in the Hawkesbury solitudes a
worthy Sydney dame recently pushed a small
Home for Veterans into the groves of gum-
trees. Six veterans, loose threads who had
escaped the tangled knot of war’s alarms,
packed up the glad swag and prepared to
five happy ever after in the new Elvsium.
But the bush paradise was hedged with most
of the regulations that fit an Infants’ Home.
It was far from the foam of the local ale
barrel. The veterans had to fight their
battles over again on tea and coffee —alcohol
being' strictly prohibited. Smoking squeezed
through with a severe caution, and the Pipe
was under cold surveillance as a suspected
sin. Inmates were expected to take regular
exercise inside the grounds. Four veterans
vanished in three days. How many remain
and how long they will remain, if any, I am
unable to say.
Mr. C. S. Thane, who is just back from
Burma, left town for the parental roof on
Saturday. He is a son of Dr. Thane, one
of the best-known residents of Yass —the
place where a steam tram with a tierce and
boiling eye ejects its passengers at 1 a.m.,
weather permitting or otherwise. The pas-
senger is bundled out of the Melbourne ex-
press into a solid wall of darkness, and
hustled into the necessary nuisance that jolts
him off to Yass Proper. (Yass Improper is
the junction where the midnight traveller
meets the steam growler with furious lan-
guage.)
lass Proper threatened to receive Mr. C.
S. Rubber Thane with a brass band and other
implements of welcome, so I fancy he got
away from Sydney by the morning mail. Re’s
a sturdy, well-set-up Cornstalk, who missed
the navy because he knew too much geog-
raphy. “I failed in the preliminary exam,
as a naval cadet, because I only passed in
geography,” says he, “so I went to sea as
a youngster in the merchant service. As a
training I think a sailing ship—l was on
the Port Jackson —is a fine thing for a boy.
If knocks the nonsense out of him.” Still
pursuing . his taste for geography, young
Thane shipped in the British India service,
and later on found his shore legs in Burma.
In tlnir land of big temples and little women
lm plunged into rubber, and struck the right
end of the boom. After graduating in his
special vegetable, the Man from Yass rose to
the dignity of being an expert, an expert
being a man who would burst if he tried to
hold another half-pint of knowledge. When
he’s in the Land of the Pagoda he travels
from jungle to plantation, instructing the
wild young tyre in the way it should grow.
Governor Murray is expected from Papua
on a hurried visit to this port. He may
burst in at any moment.
Guy Hastings, of the Bert Bailey com-
pany, is a recent English importation who is
catching considerable applause at the Palace
iheatre. He is more Brough and Bouci-
cault than Yellowdrama, and he clutches at
the heroine’s life with the easy manner of
George Titheradge plucking an epigram
from an Oscar Wilde play. Hastings’s gene-
sis was his exodus. It happened in an archi-
tect’s office in Bedford (England), about 14
years ago. Then did a youngster, who was
supposed to be studying the ethics of chim-
ney-pots, with digressions into the right way
to plan a front hall, dress himself in office
towels and give a spirited rendering of the
sleepwalking scene, as Lady Macbeth. “One
of the heads of the firm of architects and
civil engineers, to whom I was indentured,
happened to be at the door. When I’d fin-
ished,. he told me I was wasting my val-
able time in his office. I think he meant his
valuable time. Anyhow, my Darents and he
cancelled my indentures, and I was sent to
mu y f, or the sta se under Miss Sarah
I home. Guy Hastings is one of the lucky
accidents a new company sometimes stumbles
on - He is too serious about his profession
to drift into the matinde idol business, and
he might be mistaken for a steady young bar-
rister, lying in ambush for his first brief. In
spite of these misfortunes, Bert Bailey’s new
leading gentleman is one of the hits of the
season.
“Your Dear Eyes,” written for, and sung
by, Ludwig Schaaffer, is a new love ditty that
moons round the same old place—the best
girl s eyelashes. “Waves and Waters,” described
as an entr’acte for the piano (by Varney),
has a pleasing swish in the tail of its fre-
quent quavers. It can be commended to the
Young Person who sighs for something easy,
fascination Waltz,” by Frank Talbot, has
the picture of an auburn-haired charmer on
its cover. As a waltz, it’s up to the average.
Composers who can strike a “Blue Danube”
theme seem to be either too dead, or too
busy cutting their first teeth, to worry about
matters musical. Paling and Co. are re-
sponsible for the above.
In the former production of “Ben Hur”
in this town., several girls belonging to our
most expensive homes walked on as “ex-
tras,” and unloaded their histrionic genius
by waving palms in the offing of stage scen-
ery. This time “Ben Hur” is again snatch-
ing a few maidens from suburbia’s red plush
drawing-rooms. Miss Olive Lees. Miss Bee
Macdonald, Miss Lawrence (Adelaide) and
Miss Piper (Melbourne) are amongst the
rush of damsels who will help the Hebrew
back to his inheritance.
The Imperial Hyde Park Roller Rink will
have been opened in the presence of a thou-
sand guests or thereabouts before this reaches
you, oh, faraway Arini.
The Doris Madden recital last week had
a cold chill in its middle and a court curtsey
at both ends. Behind the Victorian girl’s
recent performance in St. James’s Hall there
stretches a bumpy background of scales and
exercises, and much rising with the dawn to
pursue the dragon of technique. I could
almost hear the bumps and see the dragon
writhe, as a slim young woman in pink drap-
ery chased the crashing chords of Bach’s
Tocatta” up and down the ivory keys. It
was a successful chase in the academic sense
of smiting the right notes. Pianist Doris
attacked the “Sonata Appasionata” immedi-
ately after, in the same way. It’s the way
of an expert wood-cutter with an axe. The
tree falls where it ought to fall; the Sonata
ends where it should end. Everything is up
to.schedule time when this player gets a good
grip of a lone keyboard.
Court curtsies ,run in the Madden knees
with unexampled ferocity. Doris bobs one
knee and stiffens the other before and after
each event. This affliction, like the red rag
on the edge of the Muscovy duck in Hans
Andersen’s tale, is considered a sign of high
rank, where geese do flock together. Singer
Annie Mills gave a delightful rendering of
Scarlatti’s “Consolati e spera.” and violinist
W. J. Coad took the cold chill off the Mad-
den recital with the singing tones of his
sweet-voiced fiddle.
The Arts and Crafts Society broke out in
a new place every day last week. This di-
gression took the shape of a loan exhibition
to aid and abet the original work of the
society. On Friday, Chinese odds and ends,
many of them out of the ordinary tea-caddy
ruck, were housed in glass cases. Mr. Hor-
ton and Miss Mira Mullins lent some of the
host-looking strays from the Land of the
Falling Pigtail.
Isn’t there an old heathen proverb to the
effect that “an enemy sees the size of thy
purse when thy back is turned, therefore,
show, him the richest portion of thy coat”?
An. Sin (before mandarins began to peel off
their. gaudy skins) blazed with embroidery in
hif? hind-quarters. Beasts, birds, sun, moon,
etc., and large families of blue and gold
lizards stamped over the spinal column of a
Knight of the Purple Button when he aired
his pigtail in the public eye. The best speci-
mens of needlecraft—on loan at the Arts
and. Crafts show —had been built for a man-
darin’s back. Lady Verney bought a book-
rack from Miss Millicent Elliot’s stall the
other day. laid on to peacocks
and bush scenery is this designer’s chief suc-
cess, and she gets away with some bold
effects
In Java there's a verb “to battik,” which
strolls round and gets into the native dyeing
business. Batiik is the humble com-
mon noun or cloth on which the battiker
stamps his weird patterns, which are first
cousins to Pharaoh’s sarcophagus rags. One
of the loan exhibitions at the recent Arts
and Crafts show was a Java battiked cloth,
showing John the Baptist fighting the
Wagaing. John was like a grasshopper
dressed in spotted armor. He sat upon a
horse and cut the atmosphere with a nose
like the beak of a fowl. The Wagaing (I
presume she’s Java’s Worst Woman or
Sorceress Lady) had her back hair done up
in a Cleopatra bun. and was stabbing at
space from the middle distance of an ele-
phant. There were two referees —early
Egyptian hair drill —and an umpire who
was like a lost ancestor of Jack Johnson
before he found his punch. I’m told the
I)yaks of Borneo and the Battiks of Suma-
tra, and other brown heathen round those
spicy islands, formerly helped the Javanese
to mix their religions with many brands of
theology, till they get a holy cocktail, which
includes all sorts of ’isms. Hence (he fight
of the Baptist and the Wagaing. or what-
ever the Java hussy’s name may be.
Yours in the conviction that John the
Baptist never hit any lady in Java.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, April 29, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
On the closing night of St. Vincent’s
Bazaar, everyone appeared to be brandish-
ing a pot plant, and the effect suggested the
Macbethian scene of Burnam Wood en
route for Dunsinane. Stall-holders and at-
tendants made frantic efforts to sell off the
remnants, and it needed muscle to escape
their clutches. At the cafe chantant, Louise
Pinschof, in a saucy knickerbocker suit,
departed from the classic melodies of the
family, and warbled coon songs, prancing
carefully meanwhile in the serio-chronic
manner. Elmhurst Goode warbled “My
Country,” in a white gown, a blue tennis
hat and a scarlet bow; also, she leant grace-
fully on a blue gum sapling, which I later
observed ornamenting Violet Clarke’s gar-
den in the “Faust” scene. The sole re-
maining traces of the bazaar are raffle
tickets. Everybody semes to be hugging a
forlorn hope of capturing a motor, or a pair
of diamond earrings, or other prizes from a
sweep” to be drawn in a day or two. The
good old gambling evil had a great time dur-
ing the St. Vincent’s rally.
The National Council of Wimmen fore-
gathered at the Turn Verein Hall one even-
ing last week, when the Fuller lady presided
in a head-to-heel coat of Russian sables over
a frock of ivory chiffon and lace. At the
outset she was laden with a vast presenta-
tion bouquet of purple and yellow. The
subject of the pow-wow was Bush Nursing.
r - Jean Greig, very timid and shrinking in
a black velvet gown, belied her air of
timidity by discoursing for nearly two hours,
lhe proceedings were partly obliterated by
a roaring drill instructor in the next room
and the odors from the German kitchen.
Dr. Edith Barrett tried several times to
quieten the Voice of Doom; but nobody was
brave enough to remonstrate with the cook
and tell him to calm his wild smells.
The Gaud Mayoress, turned out in the
cold by the Town Hall plasterers, has re-
sorted to parties in the open air. A recent
B° la mcal Gardens was billed
as Morning Tea”—a nice, warm label. But
a .sudden frosty snap made the ice-creams
things of terror, and imparted a sallow, for-
bidding expression to the tarts. The guests,
who mostly arrived in furs, looked sliudder-
ingly at the fruit salad, and thought of hot
muffins and bacon. When they departed,
leaving the better part of the banquet to the
caterer and the birds, the hostess meandered
sorrowfully to a she-club, and was toasting
her toes before the fire, when about 50 per
°^h er quests sneaked in to do likewise,
ihen there was a rush of explanation, and
everyone felt uncomfortable in three vol-
umes.
The Victorian Artists -Were At Home,
among trails of Virginia creeper and chry-
santhemums, on Thursday evening, at
Eastern Hill. The function marked the end
of the Sketch Exhibition, and the rows of
little scratches still ornamented the walls
of the South Room. Mrs. Jansen looked
after a musical programme, and, when the
melody was not too loud, an engagement
rumor could be heard circulating amidst
suppressed excitement.
In the sacred name of Charity, Society is
being implored to buy tickets for the Ragged
School Ball, to be hopped in St. Kilda Town
Hall, on May 2.
Bendigo, which has been indulging in its
hair, caught and kept the Gaud Mayoral
couple for several days, and onlv allowed
them to escape by train after pelting them
with flowers and ferns.
May Vale Gilfillan did handsomely with
her Athenaeum show. Mrs. Miller annexed
in enamel necklet of boronia. Mr. Panton
bought a trifle to send to his daughter in
England. Artist Wheeler carried off some
wrought silver and turquoise buckles, and
various other people came with common,
ordinary money, and left as the owners of
artistic treasure.. An English enamel con-
noisseur .who visited the exhibition was
struck with the originality of the designs.
Very marketable in London or Paris,” he
murmured after a critical inspection.
The Melbourne Shakspearian Club’s 27th
celebration of Will’s birthday drew or
hauled about 1000 people to the Masonic
Hall, last week. Alexander Watson, the
English litterateur whom Carlyle Smythe
has lured to Australia for lecturing purposes,
was enthusiastically welcomed, and “did” a
scene. Charlotte Hemming tore off about
three yards of “Coriolanus.” Amateur en-
thusiasts also had their yelp, and Secretary
Frank Russell was at his wits’ end to un-
chain them in their proper turns. Watson is
a serious young man of the lean and hungry
type, and, after the show, kindly Mrs. Smythe
carried him off to a Vienna supper.
The financial affairs of the Australian
League Club have fallen into disrepair, so
an effort is to be made to build them up
again with a rally at President Staughton’s
house, next week. Devotees of the cause are
invited to come along and save the League
at one-and-six per bonnet.
The Crochet Guild had a show last week,
at which all the exhibits were finished
articles ready for use instead of the usual
disjointed sampler,'. They found a ready sale.
Melba lent some exquisite doyleys from Lady
Aberdeen’s School of Crochet, and Mrs. Bal-
main a scarf worked by her mother, Mrs.
Squatter Fairbairn. From early on Thurs-
day morning until dusk, the place was filled
with women swapping intricate stitch cal-
culations. Whenever I hear crochet enthu-
siasts talking together, I wonder why so
few women are good mathematicians.
Elsie Hall’s statement that Queen Mary
wears white kid gloves in the house all day
recalls the fact that the Northcote lady did
the same thing while in Australia. No
doubt the idea was to preserve the hands
while polishing the stove or peeling the pota-
toes for tea.
Dr. “Pat” Leary is back, wearing a
thoughtful look, resultant on tramping 15
Tasmanian miles per day at the trim heels
of his energetic bride. Every day of the
honeymoon, she swung a rifle over her well-
tailored shoulder and footed it merrily, while
Pat walked behind, wishing that he was an
angel or a vulture or anything with wings.
The widow of the late Frank Lincoln has
joined a house-agent firm, and is taking the
place of Mrs. Stewart Anderson, who has
found the boom lucrative enough to give her
a trip to China. The woman house-agent is
becoming fairly numerous in Melbourne and
suburbs. Being so sympathetic about cup-
boards and linen presses, she appeals forcibly
to housewives.
Gladys Gunn, daughter of the Wagga wool
growers, startled conservative catteries by
having a girl tea-party the day after her
wedding, instead of being officially invisible.
The breezy, unconventional Gladys was mar-
ried on dad’s far inland station, last week,
to Squatter Lupton. The two came on to
Melbourne, and here she gathered together
the. crowds of girl chums who were unable
to journey to the country spree, anti feasted
them at the Vienna. Bride and bridegroom
later climbed aboard a mailboat bound for
England.
Mrs. Grundy is insisting in high, clear
tones that the petticoat positively must be
worn at this winter’s dances. To make
dead sure, a. ballet mistress should be en-
gaged to officially certify that the female
guest is well and truly clad.
Miss Maxwell, of the Hebald staff, is re-
covering from a severe oneration in the
Homoeopathic Hospital. Though still “not
at home” to callers, she is getting along
nicely, thank you.
A society charmer just returned to Mel-
bourne has composed an excellent face cream.
Tlubby is in too exalted a position to permit
ot the thing being marketed, or the small,
inventive dame might stand a good chance
ot making a pile. As it is, she can only pose
as. an amateur Mozart or Schumann »in
skinphonic ‘composition.”
• Beddome, & dark-eyed Hobart girl, is
boat. Mamma has come
to Melbourne to meet the returned voyager
and the Scotch fianc6 she attached during
her travels. The wedding is booked for an
eaily. date, weather and other circumstances
permitting.
Mount Battery Station turned out gaily
and came to town to watch and hear cousin
Aline Bowden exchange “I wills” with Noel
WaHace, of Sydney, in St. Paul’s Cathedral.
Ihe bride wore a grey, squirrel-furred tailor-
made, and her two tailored bridesmaids were
cousin Ireda Graves and a pretty Bowden
sister.
Admiral Bridges and his womenfolk are
going to resume possession of their old
loorak quarters, which have been kept in
order during their absence abroad by the
lluntpr Landales. The H.L.’s have gone
back to Deniliquin and the rather parched
station to pray for rain.
Captain Kenneth Buchanan, who last year
carried off Muriel Cumming to share his
Indian bungalow, has been moved on to a
post in Scotland. The couple have joyfully
put away their mosquito nets and started
for Perth, where Walter Scott’s “Fair Maid”
came from.
The Rutter Clarkes have tired of London’s
eternal greyness or something, and moved to
Spain.
Your “Johanna” erred slightly in the issue
°t. 11/4/ 1-. The Bage, who is down south
with the Mawson expedition is not a nephew
of Director of Education Tate. There is no
lelationship or family connection between
the parties.
The energetic McMahon lady now limps
slightly as a result of her severe motor acci-
dent. of a few months back. She has been
a trip to the West to try and tone up her
nerves.
One of the fair half-dozen chicks of the
I uller family recently escaped from the
Macedon cottage and motored down to town
with Mamma. On one occasion, his Ex.
himself conducted a detachment of the family
to a matinee; but these days they are mostly
left at home to. play with their toys and care-
tully-selected imps from Nice families, who
are asked to attend as playmates. Imagine the
feelings of the average small boy who has;
been commanded to play at Government
House, and is being cleaned and renovated
by panting relatives in spite of a gallant
resistance!
Every evening, while Lily Brayton’s maid-
masseuse is putting in her gladdest hour
smoothing Lily’s countenance, the lady secre-
tary reads aloud the letters from yearnful
flappers who want to die for her, or to fling
themselves at her feet and guess the price of
her boots. What would the stage star do
for incense and adoration if the flapper were
eliminated, and growing-up made an in-
stantaneous process, with an indifferent baby
at one end and a perfectly sober adult at
the other?
Marshall Hall’s opera “Stealla” —(“Stella
was what I meant to write, but the office
typewriter is a fractious animal with ideas
of its own) —well, Marshall’s opera is to
have the assistance of programme notes, when
it sees the footlights in May. The composer
was. always careful to explain his orchestral
music in lumps of small type, and the habit
apparently still clings to him. One burst
goes this way: “Here the clarionet gives a
prolonged sigh.” No man knows what a
clarionet will do at a given time, and it
would have been wiser for Marshall to have
given the player discretionary powers. The
sound from the instrument may prove to be
a groan, or a hacking cough.. It may even
be a dry howl.
Walter Withers has been producing much
Australian landscape work of late, and in-
tends walling it for a special view at the
Athenaeum, from Tuesday, April 30, to Sat-
urday, May 11.
The young Repertory Theatrical Club had
its second meeting last Friday, and yawned
attentively to a paper on Ibsen. The
paperer—one Sinclaire —wears red hair and
intense white features, which don’t go very
well with his black-frocked curate’s figure.
He reeled off his remarks in a deadly monot-
onous voice. The important business was
the selection of a social committee of ladies
with a gift for hostessing. The proposed list
was read aloud amidst a flutter of approval,
all the selected possessing ballrooms and re-
putations for unlimited tea and cake. Not
for nothing does a G.-G. associate himself
actively with a club.
The death of stage-manager Steyne hap-
pened when the profession generally was
busily engaged organising a benefit matinee
to help him through his illness. On Tues-
day, a programme that was charitable to
the audience drew a £260 house. Margaret
Cooper, beautifully gowned, was boxed with
her husband and the pretty baritone. Mrs.
Geoffrey Syme, with paddy green gleaming
from her ermine swathings and a silver hel-
met hat, filled another box with guests; and
Dorothy Grimston, in very trim fur-edged
garb, shared a third pen with two O’Hara
colleens. Lily Brayton, in her Desdemona
night-gear, drew a raffle from a tin box for
two photographic enlargements, while an
attendant stage hand looked embarrassed,
and . the Othello family four-poster loomed
tragically in the background. The prize
went gallerywards.
During the week, the Gregan McMahons
handed round tea at their rooms in Oxford
Chambers to a few local supporters of the
Repertory Theatre movement. During a
conversational calm, someone was heard to
remark that Blamire Young’s scenery was a
levelation. Stella Nathan, a well-known
Block beauty, is the theatre’s latest recruit.
She is to play a leading part in “Seagull,”
a drea,y drama by a Russian with an un-
pronounceable name, which seems to have got
into his system and ruined his digestion. It
is to be inflicted at the Athenseum in July.
Melba, returning from the Sydney races,
steamed as far as Albury, then left the
N.S.VV. locomotive panting at the water
tank, and was oiled home by road in her
own motor; She must have a great love for
her native Victoria to brave Victoria’s roads
the ones the Murray Government was
once going to mend.
ama Eight which is to farewell
William Moore is fixed for Wednesday, May
Th y rn Verein Hall. Mrs. Dearden
(Kathleen Watson), Louis Esson and Wil-
liam himself will each supply some new
; an( i soffie of Rupert Bunny’s songs
will be carolled. . As usual, it is plainly in-
timated that citizens in evening dress will
be refused admittance.
Factory managers are in despair at the
dearth of white workers, who are becoming
even scarcer than Marianne. A manager
says that when one of the hands asked if she
could apprentice her small sister, he nearly
burst into tears. One factory is after the
available country labor, and to that end is
establishing country branches—which is a
move towards decentralisation.
Agnes Murphy, the Melba secretary of

From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The North Adelaide Golf Club opened for the win-
ter on Saturday afternoon last, to the sound of loud
tea-drinking-. Miss H. L. Sanderson and Mr E W
Ellis secured one competition, and Miss Amy Jessop
won the putting prize, after making a tie with Miss
Jean Duncan. Mrs. Chief Justice Way, the Willie
Popes, Mrs. R. Colley, the Nat Campbells and Mrs.
Duncan-Hughes were among the guests of the com-
mittee.
e^ same glad da - v the Adelaide polo team beat
the Mid-North polo team at Beura by seven to two.
To show there was no malice the losers stood their
conquerors a dinner on the evening of their downfall
ana a picnic the following' Sunday.
The Private Secretary Rowes have taken the North
Adelaide house, till lately tenanted‘by Archdeacon
and Mrs. Bursel.
The Willie Popes are off to England shortly, like-
wise the Davenports. Mrs. Willie Milne and her
niece, Miss MacLaren, are in Sydney, as is Mrs
James Harvey. Mrs. Harold Fisher is in Melbourne.
The O’Halloran girls are back from their trip to
the eastern States, and meditate settling down in the
Bakers’ house on Brougham-place for the winter.
The “Robe slander case” is over, and the defendant
has gone down to the tune of 200 of the best, plus
Costs. It affords fond mothers a superb lesson in
the wisdom of keeping their opinions in regard to
their son’s matrimonial projects to themselves—or
else a dismal lesson on how it is possible for the
• best-intentioned person to fall in amid the uncertain-
ties of the law.
There has been some slight excitement, locally,
over the discovery that one Mayer, a schoolmaster of
this State, is a disguised Italian Count, by name
Rossi. Rossi has been Mayer for some 30 years, and
has, presumably, forgotten how to be a Count by
this time. In any case, he hasn’t enough money. It
is impossible to be really patrician on the income of
a S.A. pedagogue.
The St. George Society fed together on Tuesday,
and made the same old remarks. The Governor, Pro-
fessor Henderson, Editor Sowden and Senator Vardon
all had a word or two to say anent England's
greatness, and the nobility and so on of the English
character.
The display at the Chrysanthemum Show on Thurs-
day was absolutely bosker, and the Governor and
Lady Bosanquet turned up and said as much.
Owen Smith and the Museum authorities are dis-
puting fiercely over a couple of whale skeletons.
Smith says they and their sheds constitute so many
blots on the North Terrace landscape, and that they
should be removed or destroyed. The Museum auth-
orities argue that the skeletons are educative. Also,
they plead that the authorities have neither time nor
money to move the vast remains. And there, at pre-
sent, the controversy lingers.
A bigger stage is badly needed in this hamlet.
Smbad was shorn of half its scenic hair, so to speak,
and came forth much weakened from the operation,
and now there is a rumor that the space is not suffi-
cient to stage “Kismet.” The grief among the Holy
who were going in a body to see if the bath scene
was really as dreadful as it has been represented, is
quite heart-rending.
The Society of Arts display on North Terrace is
poor by comparison with, other years. Internal dis-
sension has driven forth some well known and es-
teemed daubers. Will Ashton sends his usual good
stuff, and the efforts of Miss Grigg and Miss Loweay
are commendable.
Mr. Langdon has died in Melbourne, as the result
°f. his hunting accident at the end of last winter.
His spine was injured, and there was little hope of
his recovery from the first.
At the Walkerville Cottage Homes has just died
one Charlotte Bonnell, aged 96, and a resident in
Australia since 1834. Her father was a captain in
one of George lll.’s Life Guards regiments.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

A NEW REMEDY.
The old friends of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
will be pleased to know that the manufacturers of
this preparation have gotten out a new remedy for
biliousness and all disorders of the stomach, liver and
bowels. It is called Chamberlain’s Tablets, and has
met with great success in the treatment of constipa-
tion, biliousness, sick headache, impaired digestion
and liver disorders. It is easy to take, and more
pleasant in effect than pills. Chamberlain’s Tablets
not only move the bowels, but improve the appetite
and correct any disorders of the stomach and liver.
This is certain to be one of the most popular medi-
cines in use, and everyone who uses it is pleased with
the prompt relief it affords.*

HAVE YOU
INDIGESTION?
♦
Treatment that Cures the Cause
of the Trouble.
A Woman who Suffered with
Indigestion for Years Tells
How She Was Cured*
The fact that indigestion is one of the
commonest symptoms of anaemia or blood-
lessness clearly shows the close relation
between the condition of the blood and the
digestive system. Without sufficient good
red blood proper digestion is impossible.
When the blood is thin and poor, the food
remains undigested, causing pain and flatu-
lence, and the food eaten fails to build up
the tissues of the body.
Experience in treating sufferers from in-
digestion with Dr. Williams’ link Puls
shows that they enable the blood to absorb
oxygen; it becomes rich and red, and the
digestive troubles are cured.
Mrs. Thomas Kingdom, of 7 Lily street,
South Fremantle, explains how Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills cured her.
“Indigestion was my great trouble tor
years,” she said. “I would get a spell ot
relief every now and then, but it never re auy
left me. There were days when I dreaded
the sight of the meal table. As soon as i
would get anything down it would be leit
like a cold weight on my chest, and even
my back would begin to ache. I felt as it I
really could not draw my breath. Some
days I would feel ravenous, and next day I
could not look at a thing. Sometimes, too,
I could not keep the food down. 1 could
hardly hold up my head very often for the
violent sick headaches. I was sallow, and
people often remarked on it, and I was very
thin and pulled down. I would faint right
off at times, I used to be so weak. My
tongue was generally furry and coated. My
system would get full of wind, and my
heart would beat at a very rapid rate. But
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills did me a lot ot
good. The weight on my chest grew less as
I took them, and I got a healthy appetite
and gained flesh and color. This medicine
put new life into me.” .
Don’t let any dealer talk you mto taking
something which he says is “just as good.

FISHER: "Go home! Anyone would think you
belonged to me.”
“G.V.W.”: The statement in The Bulle-
tin (11/4/T2), that the Union Steamship
Co. of Maoriland is clean white, through
and through, in contradistinction to the P.
and O. service, which is as black as the
cinders of the Pit, is not quite correct. The
India-Maoriland trade carried on by the
Union Co. is not white. The big Aparima
is manned by Ram Dham, and great is the
curry and rice thereof. I’m satisfied the co.
is white in Maoriland and Australian waters
from no patriotic motive, and if the sale of
its business to the P. and O. Co. suited the
pockets of the owners of the red-funnel line,
their consciences would make a gallant effort
to fit in with the general harmony.
Maoriland expects a surplus of £< 50,000
this year, which is about the ordinary figure.
The trouble is that such a dreadful amount
of borrowing seems necessary to produce
these wonderful surpluses.
Hobart Town Council has raised the offer
for the Private Enterprise tramways 'to
£2lo,ooo—about £llO,OOO for the visible
assets and £lOO,OOO for being such a fool as
to let Private Enterprise have the concession
to begin with. Those late repentances cost
a dreadful lot of money.
At the recent send-off to Customs Officer
Mulvany, who succeeds Barclay in London
as import-values-checker, Minister Tudor
congratulated himself and his fellow-Mims-
ters on having taken a step that stopped p
lot of fraud, put honest importers on a level
with the other sort, and added thousands of
pounds yearly to the Commonwealth Customs
revenue. In this he was correct, but —a
Protective Government that honestly gave
effect to the country’s declared fiscal policy
would ere this have seen to it that imports
were so small that it wouldn’t be worth
while sending even a boy abroad to check
invoice values.
At the Cook celebration at Kurnell
(N S.W.) on Saturday Chief Justice Cullen
made a passing allusion to the “birthstain”
of historic fame. lie insinuated gently that
th United States had been founded by con-
victism as New South Wales had, but that
the U.S. had had two centuries of it, while
New South Wales finished with the evil in
about a quarter the time. There were repre-
sentatives of at least one first fleeter, now
holding a mighty high head, who, perhaps,
did not thank Chief Justice Cullen for his
reference to the “Stain.”
The Wellington (M.L.) Chamber of Com-
merce recently handed out a bunch of figures
which showed that a big falling-off in value
of the Dominion’s exports has been accom-
panied by a large increase in imports. “As-
suming,” remarked the Commerce author-
ities, “that the exports realised the declared
values, it is evident that some £2,400,000
will have to be provided to meet interest
obligations.” Whereupon the wise S. M.
Herald commented: —
It will probably be disputed by very few people
that the general line of argument on which the
Chamber proceeds is legitimate. A debtor country
must sell more than it purchases by so much as is
needed to meet interest charges. That will be ad-
mitted, and the narrow margin of exports over im-
ports will be acknowledged as an unfavorable symp-
tom of the Dominion’s outside trading operations.
And having thus “acknowledged the unfav-
orable symptom,” the Herald sheered off
the delicate subject without once colliding
with the ineffective tariff that brought the
calamitous sign into existence.
“Outis” writes: —
During the absence from their Departments of the
Federal Ministers, bent upon properly earning their
travelling allowances of 355. a day and £2 2s. for
the Prime Minister, the party wire-pullers have been
busy. Rumor avers that Josiah Thomas is on his
last trip as a Minister, as he is to be bumped out
of the Government on his return from Gilruth’s
satrapy. Senator Findley, now acting as caretaker
for the Cabinet, is named as the filler of Josiah’s
shoes. Kink O’Malley, it seems, has been marked
down for sacrifice, the reason given being that the
Bird o’ Freedom can’t stand his oats, and his head
is expanding laterally and literally. Many of the
Caucus men want Hugh Mahon to succeed the
Amurrikin as Minister. The most important news
concerns the prospective breaking away of the
moderate Labor wing, with a view of joining the
Liberal-Protectionists in a solid phalanx for next
year’s elections. The other two parties will be the
Conservative-Freetrade rump and the extremists of
the Labor party. That very soon the Fusion will be-
come unfused appears certain.
There is drought here and there in
N.S.W., and Bathurst is in the agonies of
water famine. Even the Hill End tram is
expected to stop, for want of a drink for the
boiler, and ‘farmers and pastoralists are
alarmed.” Now, Bathurst district has a
better rainfall than Yassberra, and the Mac-
quarie River, which wanders through the
town, is a considerable stream, 590 miles
long, and receiving half a dozen big tribu-
taries, one of them 340 mile's long. And
Bathurst has only about 9000 people to
wash. The Federal capital—the metropolis
of all Austral a—-will surely have more
people than that, with less rainfall, and a
Cotter River that is about one-tenth the im-
portance of the Macquarie. Query: What
kind of show will the metropolis of all Aus-
tralia have at Yassberra when the drought
comes?
“Fits” has an awakening:—
Until the other day—despite the statements to the
contrary of David Storey and others who should
know—l faithfully believed that the Labor party
was the only one that went in for the infamous and
debasing Caucus business. I understood that any-
thing of the sort was abhorrent to “Liberalism.” I
had a vague idea that before an election, C. G. Wade
or Alfred Deakin, or someone went up a mountain
somewhere, and with shining face brought down the
“Liberal” or Anti-Sosh or Freetrade platform, as the
case might be, on tables of stone. As regards the
“Liberal” candidates, I didn’t quite know how they
got the party selection, but I clearly appreciated
that it was in some totally different and altogether
superior way to that in which the hidebound Labor-
slaves got theirs. Judge my amazement and sorrow
when I discovered that a Liberal Caucus had been
sitting unobtrusively for some time past, deciding on
a fighting platform for the party; and now a senes
of Liberal Caucus selections of candidates for the
Senate has been announced. It is such happenings
as these that give point to the old conundrum: “When
is a caucus not a caucus?”
“Vulcan”: With the Federal capital nicely
settled as adjacent to its publishing counters
as possible, Sydney Telegraph evidently
reckons a little belated truth about xa.ss-
berra won’t do any harm. Speaking
(15/4/T2) of the capital designs, the King-
street patriot allowed that:
The Board is conscious that in such open country
as Canberra a square-built city, with each thorough-
fare at right-angles, would be open to the assault of
every hot wind that swept across the new seat of
government, while the gales from the south and the
south-west will render it in the winter disagreeably
cold and bleak.
Great Scott! And a very few years ago the
place was a paradise.
HIC! (After Joseph Cook , M.H.R.)
Mr. Cook said that on rising one morning one
might almost have expected to be confronted with the
glory of a New Jerusalem —or words to that effect.
An early-morning optical effect , in which the
artist reveals his great fiscal ideal of Aus-
tralia gazing upon the sunrise that heralds
the dawn of a new Australian ferusalem.
(The spider-like objects upon the sky-line
may be blasted trees , or black ants, or an
advancing army of bailiffs —it all depends
upon the point of view.)
Joe Cook, at Goulburn (N.S.W.) :
We should begin the work of building up an Aus-
tralian credit, which should be a better credit than
that of any individual State, and so increase our
financial stability; and while we were looking to
things at home in this way, there is the obligation to
maintain our Empire, and to foster its development.
This should be done by an increase in its trading
facilities, and by modifying those . fiscal barriers
which now separate the outlying dominions.
Are you listening, Deakin? Wasn’t there a
compact, or “honorable understanding, ’ or
something alleged to bar any mention of the
fiscal shindy? Is the Fuse dead? Or is
Deakin dead? Or has he grown so attabie
that Cook doesn’t care whether he’s dead or
not?
Stinking Fish is not wholly the property
of any one party. Thus the incapable Pren-
dergast, who is called Labor leader m Vic-
toria because he remains all the time in one
place, declared recently at an Eight-Hour
banquet that 2000 British immigrants had
gone back to England —presumably because
they found Australia not fit to live in, and
longed to be again amid the abundant flesli-
pots of London—by the steamships Ayrshire
and Suffolk. And it proved on inquiry that
these ships, at the time mentioned, carried
back two families of returned immigrants
in all.
It is just possible that the Melbpurne busi-
ness people themselves may yet rise up and
vigorously protest against the further bloat-
ing of the city at the expense of other ports
and centres. It begins to dawn on a number
of the archdukes of commerce that the great
congestion conspiracy entails frightful waste,
and that they are heavy losers. So a move-
ment—hardly perceptible as yet—has begun
which looks likely to shove the old spectre
off the premises, and burst the idea that
every shipload and truckload of goods must
first be rushed through Melbourne, regard-
less of its final destination. The following
extract from a recent Age indicates that the
avalanche has started its long slide: —
The Mayor of Warrnambool has been assured by a
number of Melbourne manufacturers that if Warrnam-
bool had better harbor accommodation, they would
start factories in the town, which is eminently
suitable for various manufacturing industries, by
reason of the geographical position of the port for
export trade, the numerous good factory sites avail-
able, the ample supply of fresh water and other
advantages.
Would to Heaven that an honest man could
apply the same compliments to Yassberra!
If Premier Weary does not wake up soon
and start redeeming his decentralisation
promises, the avalanche may sweep him
away, blankets and all, long before his time
comes to die a natural political death.
Postmaster-General Thomas, talking at
Port Darwin (N.T.) about the transconti-
nental railway, which some people want to
be a corkscrew or hog’s-tail contraption, “as-
sured the audience that the Government had
not turned down the line to Oodnadatta. The
Railway Commission that would be ap-
pointed would have a free hand to consider
the route, save on the point that the line
must connect with Oodnadatta some time or
other.”
It is a peculiar circumstance that quite a
lot of people seem to think it quite proper
to break a bargain with the State, or at least
to try and get a contract varied, though they
wouldn’t dream of attempting anything of
the kind where a private party was
concerned. Recently a deputa-
tion of Wonthaggi (Vic.) shop-
keepers and other leaseholders
communed with Premier Weary,
and earnestly besought him to (1)
have a new and reduced valuation
made of the properties taken up
when the township was started,
and (2) convert their leaseholds
into freeholds based on that valua-
tion. The speakers explained that
“the glamor, the glare and the
beauty had departed from Won-
thaggi,” and they had got down
to the plain, everyday business of
bogging-in. They alleged that in
their haste and eagerness to skim
the cream off the anticipated boom,
so to speak, they had offered more
than the leaseholds were worth,
and they desired relief. Weary
promised to do what was possible
for them, which was kind of
Weary, but —supposing, say, an
M.L.C. had been the landlord of
Wonthaggi, would that deputation
have been received so cordially?
Or, supposing the State had got
the worst of the bargain, and had
threatened to raise the ground
rents, what sort of a row would
there have been, and how would
the leaseholders have rushed to the
Supreme Court to make the State
keep its bargain !
Premier MpGowen, of N.S.W., has de-
clared himself a hard and fast believer in the
old Tory idea that hospitals should be sup-
ported by Private Enterprise. He doesn’t
approve of the nationalisation of health, and
adheres to the old reliance on the precarious
hat and collecting box, and the leg show, and
the overdraft. Yet if it was proposed that
his Parliamentary salary should depend on
collections and subscriptions and theatrical
benefits —!!! ?*** 1 ■
THE CHANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the first place, the Labor party, State and Fed-
eral, is to a great extent one organisation, and as it
spreads all over Australia, it is difficult for even the
most local kind of Labor man to avoid being occasion-
ally threatened with a broad Australian view.
—Bulletin extract.
There’s a patch of shining garden with its cabbages
a-row,
Where the cauliflowers blossom and the happy pump-
kins grow,
And the succulent tomato makes the owner s heart
elate,
So his eyes can never travel past his own back gate.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you,
Will you, won’t you join the dance,
When a wider range of vision is your own best
chance ?
There’s a sleepy little parish with a steeple and a
pub
That has waterworks erected round a horse-trough and
a tub,
And its calm, contented people never seem to care a
dump
About any larger matter than their own town pump.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you,
Will you, won’t you join the dance,
Can’t you see a nation’s progress is your own
best chance?
There’s a State that used to focus in the meanest
kind of way,
All its thought and hope and effort round a single
crowded bay,
And it nursed a lot of statesmen, who had learned
the happy trick
Of saluting friendly neighbors with a segment of a
brick.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you,
Will you, won’t you join the dance?
The bigger day and brighter is the land’s best
chance.
Yes, the people’s larger vision has embraced the wider
sweep
Of an undivided continent whose wealth is theirs to
reap,
And the little statesmen wither now that no one cares
a dump
For the garden and the brick-bat and the old town
pump.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won t you,
Will you, won’t you join the dance?
If Labor means Australia, it’s the State's best
chance !

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The return scrap between Flynn and
Barry, .at the Mclntosh Stadium on Saturday night,
was an instructive affair, and had the young parson
about to start on an unlimited number of rounds with
the Devil been there, he would have learned much
wisdpm from it. It would have taught him the use-
lessness of the Lord endowing a human being with
many talents without also giving the knowledge of
how to use them. Barry was pounds heavier than
Flypn; he was much stronger and a much harder
hitter. In fact, all that Nature could do to make an
ideal fighter, she had done for Barry. And yet he
couldn’t win the fight. He wasted the sweetness of his
wallop on the desert air, and the amount of energy
he dissipated on empty space would have driven a
steamer to Sydney Heads and back. Blows that
would have felled an ox or punched a hole in the
side of a war-ship flew round thick as bees in swarm-
ing time. But not only was the man who swung
them about unable to win the fight, but he even
failed to mark his adversary. When the scrap was
over it was Barry whose gore stained the floor, and.
over whose eye an ugly wound oozed redly. When
Flynn first faced the blizzard of swipes, over-arm,
hammer-like wallops, round-arm whirly-whirlies, and
massive under-arm swings and slogs, his inclination
was to get away—right away ; to back off, and, if
need be, run ; and then, when the gale abated, come
in with a rush and hit. But his manager, while he
was in his corner, breathed wisdom into the cavern
of his ear, and gave him instructions while the battle
raged, in a low voice that travelled far. So Flynn
stood up, and instead of running, side-stepped, ducked
and fended, doing some very pretty work indeed in
his guarding; and so, while avoiding punishment,
kept close enough to send in straight lefts when the
opportunity came, as it did at the end of every at-
tack. Then, as Barry came in to smash, the low,
soft voice of the manager from the corner would float
like an angel’s whisper: “Put in the left —quick, get
there first.” And Flynn would lead, and, landing
almost everywhere at once, spoil Barry’s aim, and
make him glad enough to clinch. Suddenly it
dawned on Flynn that the Napoleonic defence of being
the attacking party was capable of further extension,
and after that Barry’s already hopeless chance faded
right out. He had only one hope—that some ran-
dom blow would land on the jaw and lay Flynn out
if it didn’t knock his head away among the audience.
And with all his attacks anticipated, even that hope
died away. He roughed considerably, and tried to
do a little in-fighting, but the watchful Scott pulled
them apart immediately they clinched —and got a
couple of, cheerful Smacks himself, by the way, in
doing it. The fight went the full 20 rounds, and
although Flynn boxed well and showed remarkable
skill in evading, it became wearisome on account of
its one-sidedness.
Last week Jack Johnson announced that
while speeding near Pittsburg (U.S.A.), his “cair”
collided with another, and that he was thrown out,
cut, bruised, and had sustained a compound strain of
the back, a rick of the shoulder, and a few other in-
juries. The pain, he said, was awful. And so was
the financial loss. All his music-hall engagements
would have to be cancelled, and even the fight with
Flynn would probably have to be called off. Nobody
seemed the least bit sympathetic, and sundry sport-
ing writers accused him of putting up an advertising
“stunt.” There seems to be a lack of coherent in-
formation about the car Johnson ran down, and the
general atmosphere is hazy, uncertain and suspicious.
It is quite a time since Johnson did anything to
make people look at him and blink, and the loud pro-
testations of Johnson that he really is hurt are met
with derision. In fact, the U.S.A. seems to be deadly
tired of its colored citizen.
Hugh D. Mclntosh has commenced the
work of roofing on the Sydney Stadium, and that hall
of stoush will be a fine place when the improvements
have been carried through. The size of the great
enclosure will be in no way reduced, and the un-
sightly hoardings on its walls will give way to an
ornamental front and elegant sides. The entrances
will be of a new and improved design, by which a
crowd will walk in about a dozen abreast, and yet
be capable of perfect check. All the present office
buildings are coming down, and will be replaced
with elegant structures. Training rooms and gymna-
siums will be greeted close beside the main structure,
so that the wliole of the training can be carried out
close to the scene of battle. A Turkish bath will be
installed for the use of the athletes. In the Stadium
itself the improvements will be considerable. A
nicely-decorated sounding-board will be placed over
the ring, to save the strain on the voice of announcer
and make the place available for public speaking,
concerts, etc. A huge array of exits will make it
possible to shoo the thousands of people into the
street in about 21 minutes. Actinic lights, capable
of giving instantaneous photographs, will be set up
over and around the ring, so that pictures can be
taken night and day. When all these improvements
have been carried out the boxing season in Sydney
will be the winter, so that the best fighters of the
world will be engaged for the round circuit of United
States, Paris and Svdney. For Mclntosh’s appearance
in the United States seems to be an assured thing
now. Sometime ago a fairly gilded syndicate wrote
to him, asking him for the use of his name, a pro-
posal which he turned down with emphasis. The
offer has now come in a different form, and the syn-
dicate has offered him the opportunity of coming in
on the ground floor as general high priest of the
show. So, while the Stadium is being rebuilt, Mcln-
tosh will hie him away and go into details of the
matter, and, in all' human probability, emerge as the
world’s boss fight promoter, and have special prayer-
meetings held on his behalf.
The two Sams, McVea and Langford, will
face each other again on the evening of May 18, at
the Sydney Stadium, on business bent, McVea’s morti-
fied finger having developed into a joke. The Idol of
Paris got a bad scare, and had visions of having part
of his arm lopped off to save the removal of his
neck, of some other important section. He was fully
convinced he had developed gangrene, or something
worse, for, when he looked at the wound, he was
horrified to discover it had turned white, and the
flesh all' around the gash was the color of soiled pipe-
clay. Naturally, McVea reckoned that anything that
eould turn him white was deadly. He prepared to
meet his Maker ; and made a start by cancelling all
engagements except the one with his Maker. But
Mclntosh was made of sterner stuff. After gazing
on the phenomenon steadfastly for a few seconds he
delivered himself of seme well-chosen remarks about
the idiocy of not calling in a doctor, and ordered one
immediately. The doctor came with his amputating
axe, examined the hand, declared it well and truly
healed s and explained that petrol injected into a
negro’s skin has a bleaching effect. What McVea
thought was gangrene was merely a bleached patch.
He was interrupted bv a loud cheer from Mclntosh,
who suggested that McVea should soak lrmself in
petrol, get bleached, and then run as a new
White Hope. McVea is thinking hard over the
idea.
* * * *
A casual recent visit to Sydney Stadium
discovered the place turned into a hospital. Dr.
Bernard Newmarch was hard at work examining and
prescribing. The typiste was bn her way to get her
prescription made up. Mrs. Mclntosh wasn’t pre-
sent, being laid up at home with the influenza, but
Mclntosh himself was being examined for a poisoned
leg. When the promoter’s leg had been prescribed
for, Pat Bradley, he who so ruthlessly knocked out
Bill Rudd, came along with a neck the size of a
bull's, and discovered he was matched with a first-
class abscess. The doctor ordered him to fight on for
at least two months before returning to work. Tim
Land, the stiff-legged boxer, was suffering from/ a
mangled ear, the result, presumably, of frequent cow-
kicks while working on the farm. The Stadium car-
penter had injured his foot, and the chief ticket-taker
was suffering from paralysis of the arm, brought on
by returning money to people who couldn’t get seats.
It was a gloomy place.
The Rugby League held the last of its
practice games on Saturday, and this week-end the
Competition matches will start with a roar, for the
men have all been training hard, and are in the best
of condition. The Un'on has been invited to send a
team to California (U.S.A.), and there is talk of
the Yankees putting up guarantees for enough money
to take the men there and back, and give them a
few meals a day and a decent lodging while they are
there. It is a most unusual procedure on the part
of the Yankees; but still, it is not impossible.
The annual outbreak of the great natural
industry of football occurred in Melbourne on Saturday,
in tbe presence of larger gatherings than heretofore.
The—er—occupation is now recognisecfly professional,
except as regards the juvenile Leaguers, who have
carefully dubbed themselves the Metropolitan Amateur
Ass. So far no Wages Board has been called for,
but the minimum seems to be 355. a week, plus
train fares and refreshments, while the maximum in
at least two cases reaches £7 10s. The most at-
tractive disturbance was between South and ’Rov, on
the former’s ground, where a close-fought, mannerly
game ended in South’s favor by 47 points to; 34. The
two teams are really about equal at present; but
South, having practised more, played together, while
’Roy was manifestly unacquainted with itself, in a
manner of speaking. Carlton and Geelong fore-
gathered on the Carlton oval. Only one netv player
embellished the ranks of either team —which’ by the
way. doesn’t augur well for either’s ultimate success
—and another courteous encounter followed, the locals
winning handily by 70 to 31. The premiers (’Don)
made a painful exhibition of the Students, by piling
up 116 points to 42. The losers weren’t in the run-
ning from start to finish. 1 The “shop” is hereby
urged to bog into its training or quit the business
altogether; you can’t build a football team nowadays
by an hour’s dumb-bell exercise one week and three
dances the next. ’Wood went over to the Metropoli-
tan ground, and made the usual ordinary ass of it-
self by losing to Melbourne, by 39 points to 68.
There is a dim suspicion that Melbourne is stronger
than has been suspected, but there is also a clear
certainty (hat ’Wood persistently loses games it
should win, and then has to hustle like Satan to get
into the finals, though, so far, it has always had
Satan’s success. Richmond encountered the regen-
erated Saints, and with much difficulty got the upper
hand by seven- points only—s 3 to 46. A pleasing
innovation this season is the presence on each ground
of a steward —not the handy sort who brings you a
cup of tea or a whisky straight, but a white-clad in-
dividual who follows the plav, and is expected to re- •
port to the League any outbreaks of violence, lan-
guage, and the like. Whether any of the five re-
ported anything last week, and whether the League
will do anything if they did report, is not yet known,
but one, noticing something irregular, stepped up to
a player, and, inquiring his name, was promptly in-
structed to “Go to Hades.” These stewards are paid
30s. for their afternoon’s toil.
Like the League the Ass. rejoiced in extra large
attendances. It also indulged in an inhoiration by
reducing its teams to 16 men, as against the League’s
18, the nominal idea being to make the play less
congested, but the real reason being the difficulty of
finding tbe wherewithal to pay tbe players decent
wages. Anyhow, the games were ornamental epi-
sodes, exciting at times and dull at intervals. The
re-organised Northcote team, composed of six former
’Coteites, six ex-Prestonians and four new men, put
up a strenuous struggle against Brunswick, and
downed it by one measly behind—s 2 points to 51 —-
which was a creditable feat, and should put heart
into the combination. Essendon thrashed Brighton,
but not so soundly as expected—B3 points to 40 was
the measure thereof-—the suburb of Robinson Snow-
ball having, apparently, made up its mind to bog in
to some purpose. Port Melb. achieved a considerable
feat by .kicking 10 goals and only three behinds, but
as its opponent, ’Town, simultaneously notched riine
goals, 16 behinds, the feat was of no permanent
value. North took P’ran in hand, and put in a
great finish, and won by 74 points to P’ran’s 58.
Not one of the five stars it bought from
Carlton now remains' in the team, and all,
when they left, stepped down, not up. ’Scray
had the pleasure of meeting the newly-constructed
team —Melbourne City—and stacking up 134 points
to 21, which was a woebegone calamity for the
novices ; but then you don’t build a football team in
a week, or a year either.
The final of the Parramatta Hundred
(N.S.W.) was what followers of the game describe
as a glorious finish. That is to say, the three placed
men bullocked their hearts out, strained their boilers,
and were so dead, dog-beat at the finish that, as each
one glided over the line, his chin dropped on his
chest, has arms slackened; and he just gave up the
ghost, careless whether he lived or died, and quite
oblivious that all around an excitement-mad crowd was
cheering its head off. A much better game to
watch than play. It was one of the closest finishes
ever seen on the waters of the classic Parramatta.
Felton, the winner, beat Ripley, the second man, by
a quarter of a length, with Sid Kemp the same dis-
tance behind the second. Nine started, and, as
Pearce did not race, Felton, with his ssec., became
virtual scratch. The others were S. Kemp (10 sec.),
N Ripley (14sec.), F. Starr (16sec.), Peter Kemp,
jun. (30sec.), T. Kemp (36sec.), E. Towns (40sec.),
N. Hawkless and C. Matterson (50sec. each). They
started against a head wind, which, however, did
not ruffle the surface of the water, and an incoming
tide. All of which was calculated to make the race
to the strong rather than the swift. Matterson
and Ilawkless, the limit men, broke away first, and
E. Towns went in pursuit at a great pace. Then T.
Kemp spurted, and, making the pace hot, overhauled
Matterson. Towns flashed up on the outside and took
the vanguard, but T. Kemp came at him, and re-
gained his old pos’tion. Just about here, Ripley,
who was a hot favorite with a certain section of good
udges, swung himself through the ruck with a long,
graceful stroke that suggested big reserves of power.
But off Mortlake Gasworks, Felton, the ultimate win-
ner, began to assert himself. He streaked up to
within three lengths of T. Kemp, who was still making
the pace, and it became a struggle between T. Kemp,
Felton, Ripley and Sid Kemp, all the others being
hopelessly left. It had been strenuous before, but
now it became desperate. At Tennyson, T. Kemp
was still leading, but Felton was only two lengths
behind, and rowing with a suggestion of ease. Sid
Kemp closed on R'plev, and the four swept on, get-
ting closer and closer every stroke. At Cabarita T.
Kemp was still in front, with Felton only half a
length away. But Sid Kemp had come up to within
half a length of his brother’s pursuer. Just after
passing Cabarita wharf Felton suddenly went for his
life, and lifted himself into the lead. R : plev, with
a mighty heave, went after Felton, sweeping past
T. Kemp; and, as he bounded, Sid Kemp also shot
forward, passing his brother and almost overtaking
Ripley. Felton, watching them warily, knew the
supreme moment had arrived, for the goal was in
sight. As R : pley and Kemp seemed to suddenly
leap up to him he leaped again, and so did they all.
But Felton was going first, and crossed the winning
line a quarter of a length ahead of Ripley, who beat
Sid Kemp for the second place by the same distance.
It was a great race—to watch.
A. Felton, the winner, is easily the most pro-
mising sculler on the horizon at nresent. A couple
of weeks ago he wiped out Fogwell for the Northern
Rivers championship without apparent exertion ; and
before that he had extinguished the light and hopes
of Hagnev, the cyclist-rower, who honed to follow
in the footsteps of Arnst. His next battle will be
with Harry Pearce, and then, hey, for Arnst and the
gilded ridge.

Eddie Durnan, of Canada, who bobs up
periodically for a tilt at the world’s sculling cham-
pionship, and regularly goes down again, is after
Richard Arnst. He wants a match in Canadian
waters, and has agreed to give £ 500 expenses, and
throw in the picture rights as well. Arnst is on a
good course, and no doubt will close with such an
offer, for the event can be pulled off right awav after
Englishman Barry has been well and truly walloped.
Presumably, there will be some value in the picture
rights.

The opening of the Sydney lawn tennis
season on Saturday last didn’t inspire much enthus-
iasm among lovers of the game. The “district”
system (which has allegedly been weighed for the
past two years, and found wanting) has been wiped
out, and replaced with the pernicious club system,
which opens the way for the canker of caste. The
first day revealed some fearsome wallopings, sufficient
to blow the weaker clubs right out; so what may be
expected as the wealthier clubs grow stronger, and
the poor ones fade, is not hard to foresee. Lawn
tennis has entered on a period of decline.
Sydney metropolitan cricket position grows
exciting, as a final is now necessary between Redfern
and University, to see who shall kiss Polly. Red-
fern, making great haste, scored a three-point win
over North Sydney; while University could only get
away with a two-point victory over Central Cumber-
land. Previous to this the competition score had
stood: North Svdney, 18 points. University, 17 ; Red-
fern, 16. If North Sydney could have beaten Redfern
it would have won the premiership—but it failed
utterlv. So Redfern, with a three-point win, jumped
to 19 points. University, with a two-point win,
reached the same number —hence the final. North
Svdney having won the toss went to the sticks and
smacked 120. Redfern tore in and banged 187 for
the loss of three wickets, and, declaring the innings
‘closed, requested North to come back to the pitch
and get killed. North came and walloped up 113,
thus leaving Redfern with only 46 between it and
that three-point win it hungered for. The 47 were
made for the loss of two wickets, and Redfern was
on top with eight wickets and one run to spare.
Universitv seemed to have an easier job, but failed
to get through. Central Cumberland’s first attempt
had vielded 146. University replied with 248 for
the loss of seven wickets, and put the Parramatta
men back at the wickets, 102 behind. University’s
task was to get them out before thev could put up
that number —but, bv the time old Sol blew his
candle out, onlv eight wickets had fallen for 125,
and all hope of the big victory had vanished.
Not much interest attaches to the other matches, as
they have no bearing on the destination of the eham-
pionsh’p. Balmain fell upon Waverley, belting its
bowling for 173, and then bowling its belting for a
miserable 87, and thereby winning by practically two
to one on the first innings. Middle Harbor made a
more or less unholv show of Burwood, winning by
four wickets and 122 runs. The Burwood crowd ac-
cumulated 204 in the first inn’ngs, but Middle Harbor
piled up 326 for the loss of six wickets. But of
all the hideous, disgraceful downfalls ever dealt out
to a First Grade team, that which Sydney received
at the hands of Petersham must be the worst. Hav-
ing dismissed Sydney for 73, Petersham slogged, piled
and pushed up a colossal 407 for six wickets, and
then declared. Svdnev had just time to run up 101
for the loss of two wickets when the light gave out,
and left Petersham on top with the amazing score of
334 on the first innings. The Glebe-Paddington
match, which aroused such keen interest among the
barrackers of the two teams, ended in a draw, where-
upon both sets of barrackers cursed. Glebe piled 242,
and then had a shot at Paddington wickets. Pad-
dington paddled up to 230 for the loss of eight
wickets. A deadly slow game.
The success of North Sydney in third-
grade cricket is amazing. The last three seasons have
seen it annex the tronhv regularly, and the record is
better the deener it is pried into. In the last eight
years the club has been on top seven times. The per-
formances of the third-grade chamuions do not re-
ceive that recognition to which they are entitled.
The stars should be elevated to the higher snheres,
even if it does menu drowning out some of the has-
beens who are neither useful nor ornamental.
When E. W. Schneider, the N.S.W. ama-
teur cvclist, was asked to represent the Ma State and
Australia in the Olympic Road Race round Lake
Malar, Sweden, the young man opined that he could
not do justice to the task unless he was sent over
REXONA, THE RAPID HEALER.
Rexona is a reliable remedy for all eruptions and
irritations of the skin, Eczema, Pimples, Sores, Chil-
blains, Chapped Hands, Sciatica, Itching or Bleeding
Piles, Cuts, Burns, Bruises, Scalds, Bad Legs, Stings
of Insects, and all kinds of inflammation. Rexona
is sold only in triangular pots at 1/6 and 3/-.*
early to train over the actual course. The N.S.W.
Cyclists’ Union, which was trying to raise the wind,
found it couldn’t foot the bill, and sent word to
Schneider not to bother. Now Schneider writes in
a strain that implies he is not only willing, but
almighty anxious to take part in the tussle, and the
Union has made arrangements through the local
Olympic Council, which is the Sporting Federation,
for him to compete if he feels that way. But since
the idea was first mooted there has grown up a pro-
found conviction that Schneider’s lack of experience
in road racing is likely to prove fatal to his chance.
It is simply marvellous how professional
footracing still thrives in Sydney and its alleyways.
A 75-yards handicap out Marriekville way on Satur-
day last was worth but a modest £lO 10s., and yet
no less than 70 starters struggled for the paucity
thereof; and 2000 people cheered, chewed, wagered
and swore away the afternoon. The attendance at
such a small meeting threatens to turn the heads of
sundry would-be promoters who have money to burn,
and tempt them into big promotions which are likely
to end in loss.
Saturday last saw the lacrosse players of
Sydney abroad, with their butterfly nets under their
arms or over their shoulders. This game is growing
slowly in the N.S.W. capital, and, on Saturday last,
no less than eight teams were in the field in various
parts. The best game of the day was the tussle
between Eastern Suburbs and Sydney, and resulted
in a draw with 11 goals each. Play was not over
brilliant, and did not suggest that either side had
put in a lot of time at surreptitious practice before
the season began. There was a lack of discipline,
stick work was faulty, absolutely no attempt was
made at juggling the ball along a front. But, all
the same, tne men seemed to be in good condition,
and only require a little practice to show some
interesting play—and, it is a fact, lacrosse can be
made absorbingly interesting.

The baseballers are threatening to loom
large in Sydney this winter, and will hold a field
day at Petersham Oval on Saturday next. Over 50
teams will be represented. The actual competition
will start on Saturday, May 11, and, as by that
time the cricketers will all be free, the struggle will
be keen from the jump. The N.S.W. Association is
said to be well provided with grounds; recruits are
rolling in in large numbers, and there is a general
conviction that this will be the best season Sydney
baseball has known.
Hockey is also in full blast in Sydney, no
less than 16 teams taking the trouble to report their
doings on Saturday to the press. Hockey is a grand
game, although occasionally a man does get a feeling
as if the G.P.O. had fallen on his shins. The club
nomenclature is interesting, and suggests that the
Hockeyites are a classically inclined lot. Just listen
to this: University downed Corinthians by. 12 goals
to nil; from which it will be gathered that the
latter’s play is not up to its name. Royal Navy
and Trojans played a draw, with four goals each.
Buccaneers and Howitzer Battery also played a draw,
with two goals each. Corona First beat Pilgrims
First by one to nil. Corona Second beat Bandits
Second by six to three. Bandits First beat Bar-
barians by three to one. Reads like a page from the
bloodstained whoop of old romance.

On Saturday night, May 4, Wirths will
add to the attractions of the great circus the famous
Wild Australia phantasmagoria. The whirling pro-
duction consists of buck-jumping in every form and
variety. Ponies, mules, donkeys, bullocks, buffaloes
and horses all buck. All endeavor to unseat the pre-
sumptuous human being that gets up aloft, God knows
how. An eternal contest is raged between Australian
rough-riders and Yankee cowboys, with varying suc-
cess ; and the whole of the animal kingdom that is
capable of bearing a human on its back (barring, of
course, the camel, elephant, giraffe, quagga, ostrich,
llama, and a few sundries) is up against the lord
of creation all the time. Summed up, it is a circus, a
menagerie ; Wild Australia and Wild West U.S.A. A
pretty combination to watch as • long as no crayfish
or pork pies appear on the list of supper items.
INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS.
TONIC PRESCRIBED FOR WELL-
KNOWN SYDNEY MAN WHO HAS
LOST THIRTY POUNDS IN
WEIGHT.—WORMS THE CAUSE.
The striking case of Mr. G. B. Renton,
of 14 Sir John Young’s Crescent, and con-
nected with a well-known George-street wall-
paper house, illustrates two things: One
that doctors are not infallible, and the other
that adults are troubled with worms just as
children are, and that Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets are a most effective
remedy for this most unpleasant complaint.
The letter of Mr. Renton is purely volun-
tary and freely given, and simply states the
facts, which he will at any time confirm.
“Some time ago I began losing weight in
an alarming manner,” writes Mr. Renton,
“so much so that I went to see a doctor, who
examined me and came to the conclusion it
was due to over-work and worry. I con-
tinued to lose weight and also suffer from
peculiar internal pains. I became very
anxious at the continued loss of weight, and
thinking I might be going into a decline,
went to a second doctor, who examined me
thoroughly and gave about the same
opinion as the former one had done, and
prescribed a tonic. One night going home
in the train I read one of your advertisements
giving symptoms of people who have worms.
The symptoms given strongly coincided with
my own, and I determined to test the ques-
tion. I accordingly procured a packet of
your Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets,
and took eight tablets, and in the morning
four Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and to
my intense satisfaction and relief, passed
two very large stomach worms. 1 took them
in a glass and showed them to the doctor who
had last examined me, and who had pre-
scribed the tonic, and it is needless to say
he was surprised at the result. Altogether
I lost 301 b. in two months, due to these
worms, and you may believe me I was thor-
oughly alarmed, thinking I might have con-
sumption. I regained all this lost weight
immediately I rid my system of the worms,
and am in splendid health at present. These
are the simple facts which speak for them-
selves, and I shall be only too pleased to
confirm them to any person who doubts
their truth. You have my permission to use
this for publication. Yours truly (signed),
G. B. Renton.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation
for the eradication of Worms in children and
adults. For sale by all chemists and store-
keepers, price 2s. 9d., or will be sent post

A Journal which Believes in Remaining III
in Order to Save Money.
The other day a Victorian Labor man not
only rebelled at the disreputable and unbusi-
nesslike and generally futile system of cadge
by which the semi-Private Enterprise hospi-
tals of his State are kept more or less going,
but dared to voice his sentiments in the
matter. Whereupon Melbourne Age, whose
Toryism grows steadily fruitier w r ith the
mellowing years, scolded him severely. In
the course of a column of shocked protest, it
said: —
As regards the “health nationalisation” issue, it
can only be described as a herring across the track.
The idea of nationalising health was quite recently
adopted by the Labor party of Victoria; but it did
not originate there. It was taken without acknow-
ledgment from the columns of The Aue, and this
journal had been advocating it for years before Labor
thought it even worthy of consideration. .. .The
Labor officials say that they believe in health nation-
alisation. We believe in it, too. So do thousands of
citizens of all shades of political thought. But
because we favor a particular scheme of hospital
management (which quite obviously cannot be en-
forced either now or in the near future) is that a
reason, etc., etc.. . . Health nationalisation will surely
tome in time, but its time is not yet.
A diverting side-feature of the above is the
Age’s nervy suggestion that it is the author
of the health nationalisation ideal. Have-
lock Ellis published “The Nationalisation
of Health” nearly a quarter of a century
ago. The world has progressed vastly in
knowledge and intelligence since those days.
Even journals of the Age stamp now accept,
as an abstract proposition, that the upkeep
of the hospitals is as much the duty of the
State as is the taking of measures to prevent
the spread of (say) plague or smallpox.
They represent, however, that “the time is
not quite yet”—as the British Board of
Trade had till last week been remarking for
years past to those panic-stricken mariners
who howled in its reactionary ear v that the
hour was ripe for new regulations as regards
life-saving apparatus at sea. Meanwhile,
whenever an epidemic -of sickness strikes
Melbourne or the country parts of Victoria,
the papers are filled with stories of how
William Smith or Ermyntrude Brown
was turned away from such-and-such a big
hospital, in a critical state of health, owing
to the fapt that every bed in the institution
was occupied, while the nurses were camp-
ing in the backyard, and the doctors were
frantically meditating the possibility of in-
stalling stretchers in the operating theatre.
Private Enterprise reads of the rejection—
occasionally it reads of the consequent death
—and being scandalised, it is galvanised into
spasmodic action. The streets are flooded
with females displaying collection boxes and
ingratiating grins. Actresses organise mat-
inees, fight-promoters order their minions
into the arena, all in the gracious name of
Charity. As a result of a tremendous amount
of tumult and shouting for help, the flag of
financial distress is hauled down temporarily,
and the hospitals start once more on the
old, heart-breaking struggle to perform the
most important of duties to the community
on an insufficient income and a thumping
overdraft. It is this preposterous arid
wicked state of affairs which bogus Liberal
papers claim should be perpetuated indefin-
itely—the time being “not yet quite ripe”
for reform. The truth is that there are
some abuses that are ripe for extirpation the
moment attention is called to them. Among
them, the existing system of hospital man-,
agement holds a high and dishonorable posi-
tion. It has confessedly proved a tragic
failure; and it is as out of date as Free-
trade. What the cities need is a collection
of hospitals equipped in every way for the
business of accommodating all the ailing
citizens who clamor at their doors. Coun-
try residents should not be driven to depend
wholly on the local Private Enterprise phy-
sicians, who may be good and skilful men,
but who may, contrariwise, be alcoholic in-
competents. The baekblocker has as much
right to have, reasonably adjacent, the means
of saving his life as the. city-dweller has. In
other words, each of him has a right to a
well and sufficiently furnished and properly
staffed State hospital fairly close to his
front door. The cost of such innovations
would be considerable, and the thought of
good red gold being squandered on mere flesh
and blood has ever been revolting to the
“Liberal” mind. But that consideration —
and it is the only real argument against
health nationalisation—carries no weight. It
is a hoary truism that improved health is
worth a heap of gold.
Concerning Certain Piffle About Universities.
Some amazing piffle was talked the other day
by the S. M. Herald, in connection with
Carmichael’s proposal, as Minister for
Cornstalk Education, to award two travel-
ling scholarships. Said Granny :
The University covers more than learning; and the
special influence of Oxford and of the old-world uni-
versities comes through contact with scholars —with
men of dominating personality.
And she continued, in amiable delight at her
wonderful discovery :
The influence of Sydney University, great as it is,
still leaves something to be desired, since our leaders
and teachers must know their world at first hand. ... .
The Minister recognises how much more effective
teaching will become' when it is strengthened by
.direct contact with men rather than with books —
with the men who are part and parcel of an older
world.
Now, if Carmichael can let himself be flat-
tered and impressed by this sort of thing,
may he be dropped into the sea, for it is
nothing but piffle, balderdash, tripe, dregs
and ullage. First, the holder of a scholar-
ship will spend most of his time with his
nose in his' books, binding round his brain
the wrappers of other men’s opinions, after
the manner of most students for examina-
tion ; and all the dominating personalities
in Europe will scarcely make one flicker of
light on his horizon. Second, the very last
place in the world to seek a dominating per-
sonality is in a University professorial board.
A “personality”—by which is usually meant a
strongly individualised character, a hold tem-
perament, and a stalwart independence in
thought—is something which very rarely sur-
vives a subsidence into a professorship. In
Oxford most rarely of all, for Oxford is
proudest of its traditions, which mould all
its alumni nearly alike. Nothing is more
inimical to “personality,” and you will find
more of that commodity in the New South
Wales Parliament (or menagerie) than in a
whole fellowship of Oxford dons. Thud, an
old “traditional” University is the veiy lasi
place for a man to live in if he wants to know
his world at first-hand.” He would learn
more of the world by carrying a sandwich-
board down Fleet-street, but no scholarships
are given for that. Many claims, rational
and wild, have been put forward on behalf ot
University life, but nobody ever talked worse
madness than this. Fourthly (and here the
sermon approaches its conclusion) the essen-
tial need of this nation is not to come under
the dominating influence of the older world.
It is moulding itself, or (a better metaphor)
is growing in its own way. If it doesn’t, it
will be never worth calling a nation at all.
The more it seeks to be dominated by some-
body else’s personality, the less assured and
less valuable will its own personality be.
Australia will never be grown up till it gets
out of the habit of Going Home to Ask
Mother.
On Taking Produce to Its Natural Outlet.
Victoria’s Treasurer Watt and Railways
Minister Billson have expressed themselves
—Weary being asleep, as usual —as much
pleased at Minister Beeby’s announcement
that the Ma State Cabinet is prepared to
co-operate with the Melbourne authorities
in the construction of such border railways
“as will provide the products of the Riverina
with their natural outlet through Victoria.”
Beeby’s declaration is promising, certainly,
but it doesn’t follow that it will be anything
more. He also said something about linking
un the Ma State lines in Monaro with
Eastern Gippsland, which proposition Watt
characterised as “a much more difficult pro-
blem” —the boot being on the other leg in
this case. Meanwhile, it might be im-
pressed on both Beeby and Watt that there
is no necessity for either to wait for the
co-operation of a neighboring State in order
to cart produce to its “natural outlet.”
Tljere are splendid ports along the coasts of
both States which are obviously the natural
outlets for the produce of the country behind
them, as well as the natural inlets for any
foreign goods those districts require, but
ever since the beginning of things the Gov-
ernments of both States have insisted on
dragging all produce and manufactures over
hundreds of unnecessary miles in order that
the size and importance of the big cities at
the ends of the lines may be increased, and
numbers of unnecessary importers, export-
ers, agents and whatnots may be advantaged.
Watt calls Beeby’s a statesmanlike idea —
and statesmanship, like charity, begins at
home. In sober truth, there is little hone of
statesmanship from any of the present State
politicians. The best chance of a sane rail-
way policy for Australia lies in the appoint-
ment of the long-delayed inter-State Commis-
sion, and the handing over to it, as soon as
the Australian Parliament has taken the
power to do so, of the whole business of
planning and constructing new lines, as well
as the regulating of fares, freights, etc., as
between the States. Such a body might
possibly end the disastrous, thriftless
policy of dragging everything to Sydney or
Melbourne or Perth. It might set out lines
where they are most wanted, regardless of
lov-rolling politicians and wire-pulling land-
owners. It might end the rascally system
whereby producers comparatively near a
port have to pay higher freights than they
should in order that other producers tar
away may be enticed from sending their
goods to their natural outlet. Of course, it
might not do any of these things, but it is a
moral certainty that no State Government
will —Victoria and S. Australia have been
nearly two years talking about affording
their border districts access to their natural
outlets, and are no nearer finality than when
they started —and this is a case where the
Devil you don’t know is more attractive than
tli- Devil you do. The latter is a complete
devil; the former may have some good points.
♦
“Locust” speaks a word of truth
The innocent little Japanese “scientists,” who
were on the road to the South Pole by way of Pars-
ley Bay, Sydney, for nine months (right in the
midst of the Sydney Harbor fortifications), have gone
back to Japan, from which they must have been
much missed. They came mysteriously to Sydney in
a ship that looked as if it couldn’t withstand the
Glaciarium ice. Their scientific instruments ap-
peared to be cameras. They camped near Vauelu.se,
on their way to the Pole. In the patient manner of
the Jap they learned pigeon English from the various
visitors to their camp at Parsley Bay, and as these
visitors included the elite and beauty of Sydney, and
as Byron assured us that the best language master
in the world is a pretty woman, they were thoroughly
equipped with English in case they dropped in with
Scott, or the penguins and seals in the South Polar
zone happened to be acquainted with the language.
Then, after a thorough nine months preparation at
Parsley Bay, they sailed out of the Heads with great
pomp and circumstance, escorted by the yachting
world of Sydney, a number of launches, and a galaxy
of fashionable beauty. Turning their gallant prow
towards the lonely Antarctic solitudes, they disap-
peared over the horizon from human ken for an
awful gulf of time, extending over three months.
Then they suddenly returned to an Australian civili-
sation, which had almost counted the minutes of
their absence.
While they were in Sydney, in the remarkable
locality they had chosen, the Sun pointed out that
if any such landing of foreigners were made in Japan,
close to the fortified zones, the “explorers” would
have been clapped into a Japanese gaol within 24
hours, and would have spent the nine months in ex-
plaining why they were there. Their cameras would
have been confiscated, and they would have been
lucky to escape without a charge of espionage, with
possible imprisonment for years. The Sydney daily
press went out and solemnly interviewed the Japs as
to their intentions, and received solemn, if laughing,
assurances that their mission was purely scientific;
and the daily press denounced the mean, unworthy
suspicious folk who distrusted these visitors so
polite and charming in their manners, and so amus-
ing in their pidgeon English.
The writer of this once had to visit Mogi, a Jap-
anese stronghold, on business for a week. He was
pursued with ceaseless vigilance by the Japanese
police, interrogated three or four times a day,
stopped from ascending any rising grbund, and was
wakened up to answer questions often three times in
the night, while there was abundance evidence that
his “traps” were regularly overhauled in his absence
from the Jap hotel. He doesn’t blame the Japs who
did this ; but he has nothing but contempt for his
own countrymen, who treated the visit of the Jap
spies—for they were nothing else —as a harmless joke.
SLEEPLESSNESS.
Sleeplessness frequently arises from the liver. If
the liver is out of order it affects the nerves, and if
your nerves are in any way affected you cannot sleep.
Do not resort to narcotics; a course of Chamberlain’s
Tablets will set your liver right, and you will soon
enjoy refreshing sleep.*

Fine Flavor.
Mellow Maturity.
J' For 80 years the full-flavored, mature excellence of THORNE’S has maintained it incom-
parable. It is a whisky of rare distinction—a typical, high-grade Glenlivet spirit, maintaining to the
fuifest the high traditions of the home of Fine Scotch Whisky.
Thorne's was chosen for the regalement of the King's guests at the Delhi
Garden Party—perhaps the most exclusive function of the historic Durbar.

No Rest, Night or Day. Almost Driven
Crazy. Suffered Nearly 2 Years.
Used Cuticura Soap and Ointment.
Instant Relief and Complete Cure.
“It is with extreme pleasure that I send
you the following account of my recent
trouble and complete cure by using Cuticura
Soap and Ointment. In doing so I trust
it may meet the eye of some other poor
unfortunate suffering from the same or some
similar complaint.
"About two and a half years ago I was
attacked with an itching which gradually
grew in violence until it became almost
unbearable. Very often I have had to leave
church and other places, so that I might
relieve the intensity of the itching in a good
scratch, sometimes almost drawing blood.
My scalp had a great number of small spots,
and in and around about the ears, round
the eyes, forehead, cheekbones, and all round
the jaws were so itchy, that at times I was
almost driven crazy. Often could be plainly
seen imder the skin of the face a sort of
purplish rash in patches. I thought at times
it would break out into open sores. The
itching often kept me awake at night for
hours; in fact, I had no rest either night
or day, always itching, always scratching,
always miserable. I tried several chemists
but ho lasting relief came.
“At last (after suffering nearly two years)
about seven months ago I saw an account
of Cuticura Soap and Ointment and I de-
termined to give them a trial. I washed the
affected parts with Cuticura Soap and then
I applied Cuticura Ointment and found
instant relief. There has been no recurrence
of the itching in the slightest degree for over
four months. I also took Cuticura Pills. I
cannot find worfts to sufficiently express my
gratitude. I still use Cuticura Soan as I
find it a good toilet soan and always use
it in shaving, as I find it very soothing.”
(Signed) Robert S. Dodd. 35 Francis St.,
Glebe, Sydney, N. S. W., May 30, 1911.
Although Cuticura Soan and Ointment are
sold throughout the world, a liberal samnle
of Cuticura Ointment, with 32-page booklet
on affections of the skin and scaln, will be
sent, post-free, on application to R. Towns
•- STC. Hvdnev N. S. W.
IMMEDIATE RELIEF
obtained by the use of Dr. Scheuble’s Samol, the
latest discovery for the treatment of Rheumatism,
Gout, Sciatica, Eczema, and kindred complaints.
The following is one of hundreds of unsolicited
testimonials received from people who have received
benefit from the use of this new treatment:—
York Road, Beecroft, Vic., June 7, 1911.
“Dear Sir,- —My husband had suffered with sciatica
for over 18 weeks, and had been under Doctor’s
treatment, but got no relief. I was looking at the
paper and saw your advertisement of ‘Samol’ being
good for Sciatica, and I sent and got a tube. The
first application gave relief and sleep, which he had
not had for 18 weeks.
“I have recomended it to four different friends of
mine, and thev all found it a great benefit to them.
“(Signed) (Mrs.) S. A. BOWERMAN.”
Samol is sold in tubes, price Is. Gd., 3s. 9d., and

tained direct from the wholesale agent, H. A. God-

A.S.S. (disastrous initials) : (1) When
did “our forefathers” fight to avoid compulsory mili-
tary training, or even compulsory school training?
(2) How does England enjoy “individual liberty,”
while its people pay compulsory taxes to maintain
the army? (3) You say “the fighting value of a con-
script [presumably you mean a compulsory soldier]
is always of a poor quality compared with that of
the volunteer.” If that is so, then the two worst
armies that the world ever saw must have been
those of Napoleon I. and Frederick the Great, and
Wellington’s must have been pretty bad; also, about
the worst sea force must have been that of Nelson.
(4) The epigram you attribute to John Bright really
belongs to Abraham Lincoln. He made it about the
time when he was raising the compulsory army which
later on fought so splendidly under Grant, the ori-
ginal voluntary army having run away at Bull Run.
(5) You quote “the daring exploits of Diaz’s handful
of men in their fight for the independence of
Mexico ’ as a proof of the magnificence of the volun-
tary system. And one of Diaz’s subordinates wrote
to a divisional commander during that same war:
“I send you half a dozen young men who desire earn-
estly to fight for the Republic, I would have sent
more, but I had no more handcuffs.”... .Yowi: In
order to leave Job’s record for patience trailing in
the rear, The Bulletin says once more that it cam
not undertake to acknowledge unsuitable pars, in “An-
swers to Correspondents.” The two which you men-
tion as probably having gone astray have more pro-
bably gone to an unrecorded grave. .. .Muriel Dor-
othy: No story that occupies 150 sheets of a writing
block will get into this paper.... Paroa: Glad to
hear that, from a liquor point of view, M.L. is going
to the dogs. It’ll be a change from the snakes....
Burgoo: Forwarded to the Master in Lunacy....
Gouger: Stamp story was always a poor thing, and
it doesn’t improve with age. . . .F:C.G.: Haven’t time
to think out a name to call j'our cottage; too busy
thinking out names to call politicians. .. .Frank B.:
Can’t say whether people drop dead oftener than they
used to do or not. But there are now more people
who have dropped dead than there ever were before.
. ...W.J.K.: The man who sets out to contradict a
paragraph which appeared two years ago, has The
Bulletin's fullest sympathy. Further than that it
cannot go. .. .Bellerive: The other side of the street
is at present a howling waste of bricks, so the poem
fits in nicely :
THE SLUMS.
Their making great alterations
Around the slum quarters of the town
Large buildings are going up
And old rookeries pulled down
In the shadow of some alley dwell
A few depraved old chums
Their making great alterations
Around the city slums.
No more in bold and daring mobs
Vile men and women meet
Their been hunted from their quarters
By the policeman on their beat
In little bourke for years did reign
These rough notorious chums
Till disturbed by alterations
Around the city slums.
... .Jacamar: The sonorous line you borrowed from
Byron is very good, but you fail to interest us in
the spirit of your soul and the rolling passions that
sweep you along. . . .K.A.H. : A rough product. No
stamp enclosed for return. .. .E.J.C.: Always try to
serve up good advice crisply. Be like the wise land-
lady who serves the joints plain, but uses all her
wizardry on the following day’s hash. .. . E.J. : Yours
is the first really vicious Titanic wreck poem re-
ceived. In this respect it may be said that only
those who perish escape.... Felma: They don’t make
port, but signal cheerfully.... Tahuna: N0...F.T.K.:
You appear to have gone graveyarding for want of
something better to do. Refuse to believe that she
is sleeping in the tomb. In fact, we suspect that she
isn’t dead, and wouldn’t be surprised if it transpired
that she never existed.... R.L.: No trace—not even
a fingerprint... .Frank G.: If the lost “Horseflesh”
was anything like these, it is nothing to go into
mourning about. Some people would pay heavily to
have the assurance of a reputable fireman that it
had been burnt to the ground ; that is, if it was the
sort of contribution we suspect it was. . . . W.E.'C, :
Dull poem in neat handwriting. .. .1522 : Ferguson’s
ghost has been laid out D.R.D.: Magnificently
gruesome idea, but it needs finer treatment... .E.L.:
Three small chirps. You might find a twig on an-
other journalistic tree P.A.R.: Marine poem
shipped a couple of heavy seas and foundered. Always
attach your name and address to MS J. 5.8.:
But are you sure the unbranded bullock laughs his
foes to scorn?....L. C. Jab (V.): The trouble is
that the contributor who only intends to kill his own
time also murders* someone else’s, and, in addition,
helps to further congest the bursting post office.
Don’t do it again. . . .Wormwood: Gracefully common-
place stuff. . . .Manin: Rapturous poem flies past with
its hair streaming in the wind. . . .A.C.H.: It is a
cheerful chant, but it won’t appear in the next issue
-—or the next. To tell you the honest truth, the
same good advice has been given before. .. .8.5. G.:
The type of yarn which begins: “Falsely accused of
a heinous crime, and condemned on the evidence of
scheming relatives, we find Jack Desmond, at the
opening of this story, one of a company of 270 con-
victs bound to Botany Bay,” is highly distasteful to
us.... Chloe: ’Ware Badger. We are sick of him;
and in any case he has long taken his place among
the Gracchi, Thucydides, Tummas Bent, and other
characters of the deceased past.... Front Bell (or
something like that): A great deal of silly rot is
talked about “young countries” and their need to
borrow. A “young country,” in these regions, is a
place which started with no old debts, no great mili-
tary or naval burdens, no dirty mediaeval cities which
it was necessary to reconstruct for the sake of public
health at a bigger cost than the places were worth,
and With such an endowment in the shape of public
lands as no old nation has had for 1000 years. All
they required to do was to pay the ordinary expenses
of Government out of taxation, as other nations have
to do, and apply their land revenue either to build-
ing roads and railways, or, if they had gone into
debt for these, to the repayment of the debt. The
trouble arose out of the lazy, easy habit of using
land sale money (Maoriland once used £1,300,000
of it in a single year) as revenue to avoid paying
taxes. All this self-pity about being inhabitants of
“a young country” is mere cowardice. Go and try
some of the old countries, and then you may have
cause for lamentation Ex-contributor: You say
that all true democrats desire the success of the
Labor party in Queensland. They do. But Coyne
and co. aren’t the Labor party. That body puts in-
dustrial arbitration high up on its programme, and
the gang who rejected arbitration for the general
'strike have quitted the programme. They may
call themselves Labor if they like, just as the Inqui-
sition called itself Holy, but that has nothing to do
with the case.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
G.F.: As you say, we could use it; but it would
only be at the point of the revolver.... .C.E.H.: Both
gone to that bourne from which no smudge re-
turns G. Dane: It is a rotten picture, and based
upon bosh E.E.K.: You can’t draw. Can’t say
what you are able to d0....C. Sandford: Poor nigger
joke 8.C.M.: Walked round your picture three
times and then gave the problem up. Presumably
it is about something or other....C. Tomison:

understand why the
Square Tread
possesses this unique shape.
A long series of practical tests have demonstrated that only a cover of
this particular shape can give the best results as regards wear.
The tread, being tightly compressed to begin with, is still further com-
pressed when the cover is inflated. Hence the rubber not only is increased
in strength, but acquires the tendency to close up any cut sustained, instead of

Always take a KODAK CAMERA
with you on your travels ,
Sfce KODAK is
tKe Camera for
the Traveller.
For tourist and all round work there’s no Camera superior to the
very popular No. 3a Folding Pocket Kodak, which takes postcard-size
(5| x pictures, and is priced at 90/-.
The lens with which it is fitted is of the Eapicl Rectilinear type,
the shutter works on the F.P.K. automatic principle, and there are also
two tripod sockets, a brilliant reversible finder with hood, and an auto-
matic focussing lock.
The total weight is only 410 z., yet the instrument embraces all the
practical features of cameras several times its bulk. Better still, it is
simpler in use, so that it is equally desirable for either novice or expert.
For smartness of appearance, quality of construction, ease in use,
and certainty of results you couldn’t choose anything better than this
Kodak. Price, 90/-. Postage, extra, 1/3.
Remember, no dark-room is required with the Kodak Camera. Tt
can be loaded or unloaded in daylight, and by using the Kodak Tank,
the developing can be performed in daylight, too.
Come in and let us show you what the Kodak can do, or write now

■‘A.F.J.M.”: Saw this on a picture-show advertise-
ment the other day:—
HOMELESS.
THE STORY OF A WOMAN’S FALL.
4000 ft.
I’m going along to-night to hear the thud.
Alexander Watson, who has just left London for
a professional tour in Australia, is probably the best
reciter in England. He can hold the attention of an
audience for a couple of hours with the “Midsum-
mer’s Night Dream,” differentiating the characters
and changing his voice in a marvellous manner. An-
other considerable feat of memory and character in
action is his recital of Dickens’s “Christmas Carol,”
which also constitutes a whole evening's entertain-
ment in itself. Watson has a partiality for Kipling,
but some kind friend should howl in his ear that a
little of the “banjo bard of the Empire” goes a long
wa.V in Australia.
“Harrison O.”: Jack Cannot seems to be fitting
himself to wear the mantle of the late George Lauri,
although he was not given much of a chance’in the
“Jack and the Beanstalk" pantomime last year, and
Melbourne merely noted that he was the possessor of
a good voice. In “The Girl in the Train,” he has
an opportunity to show what he can do in building-
up , a part. John’s histrionic architecture is of a
high, order—quaint and amusing and not unneces-
sarily ornate. The jester’s confidential manner with
his* audience is highly effective, and his habit of
geqtly insinuating his points, instead of driving them
home as though with the butt-end of a hammer, like
Bertie Wright, i’rinstance, is as welcome as the
death of a rich uncle.
! A lesson to young men and middle-aged girls is em-
bodied in the story of Ada Ward, the sweated evan-
gelist, who threatens to return to the stage in dis-
gust. In all her 10 years’ labor Miss Ward was the
hired preacherwoman—the journeyman saint working
fdr wages. It doesn’t pay to work for wages unless
you are some rare kind of specialist. All tne great
sensational sin-shifters —Moody, Sa-nkey, Chapman,
Alexander, Varley and their kind —set up for tnem-
sejlves. There is often money in being a boss
preacher, but to be a hired preacher of 40 is a
calamity, and to be an odd-job preacher of 60 is a
tragedy.
“Harrison O.”: Ilajj, the beggar, mentioned in
Sundry Shows (B. 11/4/’l2) as the only part in
“Rismet” which gives any scope for acting, is pre-
sented by Asche as the low comedian of the piece.
Nightly the house rocks with laughter when Oscar
addresses a brother mendicant as “lousy rags, ’
“maggoty head” and “flea-bitten dog”; also, “May
the’ ghouls suck out thy bastard’s blood,” and “May
the, nres of Hell burn brighter for thy coming,” in-
variably provoke outbursts of joy. Again, when Hajj
djfowns one of his enemies in a bath in the harem,
he discloses, by his references to the air bubbles
made by the drowning man, a vein of rich bellow-
dramatic humor similar to that which moved the
Vampire lady to blow cigarette smoke in the face of
offq of her newly-manufactured corpses. But about
tffe: crudest bit of low comedy in the play is in the
bdzaar scene, where Haji eggs on a couple of traders
to mutual stoush, and in the dust-up decamps with
the goods of both. This antiquated spasm of humor,
or a variation of it, has been the property of the
red-haired stage Hibernian for more years than I
care to remember.
I Brennan’s new show house in Melbourne, the
Amphitheatre, in Bourke-street, will seat 2000 people
afiy night they care to pay the price of admission
(Is* to 35.). The cost of the land and building is set
down at £32,000, and none of the money was wasted
in interior decoration. Plain white walls and blue
plush-covered seats, framed in white, complete tne
color scheme. The balcony is placed at the back of
the theatre, as in the buildings where the cinemato-
graph unwinds itself eternally, but whether this is
accepted as an improvement on the old horseshoe
brand of gallery there is no means of knowing yet.
Up to the present Jim and Liz merely look upon it
as a novelty. Later on, it may be looked upon as a
plain or variegated nark.
London music-hall stars are getting seriously
alarmed at the extent to which the dramatic element
is. invading the variety theatres. They fear that their.,
supremacv, if not their actual jobs, will disappear.
At the Coliseum nearly half of the programme and
the time is taken up with a dramatic, spectacular
musical .mixture, palled “The Mosque of India.’ Ami
close' By, at the Hippodrome, much of the time and
. space that, once belonged to the song and dance artist
:. are monopolised by the opera “Cavalleria.Ru&ticafia,”
“ performed'in full under the personal direction of com-
poser Mascagni. The Referee hopes that the facility
with which variety managers can now book these big
and attractive productions, “will teach the big-
salaried, much-petted, single-turn people to behave
themselves in more seemly fashion, not only as re-
gards scamped work, but also, their lofty habit of
stopping away from their duties at their own sweet
will and pleasure.”
“Parisiene”: The biograph is doing The' *Eall of
Robespierre just now, based on Sarddu’s drama” of
“Thermidor.” It —the drama —failed in Paris. The
Republicans were annoyed at the lack of respect shown
to the memory of their hero. One of them yelled out
from the pit: “Why, you fools, Robespierre was the
man who raised you [the actorsj from the position tof
helots, and ranked you with honest menM,
Saillard, as Robespierre, in the biograph", is wonder-
fully exact. Equally true, no doubt, are St. Just,
Couthon, Tallien. Madame Tallien, arid Josephine
Beauharnais, afterwards Empress. The culminating
scene shows the Convention. Robespierre tries in
vain to speak, and Legendre shouts, “The blood of
Danton strangles you!” —something of an error this,
by the way. The famous old jeer came really from
the assembled crowd in unison. Then we have Robes-
pierre mounting the tumbril, and off to the guillo-
tine. Moving, indeed !
“Stargazer”: Pinero, undaunted by the thorough
failure of his “Mind the Paint Girl,” says he is set-
ting about another comedy dealing with theatrical
men and manners. His next is to, be on the subject
of the New Drama. As Pinero says it, it sounds like
a threat, and no doubt England’s foremost dramatist
of only the other day is really mad with the more
recent ’play makers who are responsible for making the
later Pineroies look a trifle pale and ill. Pinero’s
failures are due less to the falling off of Pinero than
to the change of taste brought about by Shaw, Gals-
worthy and Co. The artificiality of the creator of
“The Mind the Paint Girl” is very glaring contrasted
with stuff produced by the later arrivals. Pinero’s
next play should be interesting and savage. In fact,
it should be written with an axe.
“Cockaigne”: Surprising to hear that Tom Thorne
is on the rocks. What s the good of making money V
Jame 3 and Thorne, after a long run of big salaries
in burlesque at the Strand (London), wen., into
vaudeville management with Montague. Struck oil
in 1870 with Albery s “Two Roses,” which ran for
300 nights. Small expenses. They only had Irving
and Honey, about .£l2 a week each. Irving went
to the Lyceum at only £l5, raised to £25 after
“The Bells.” Montague went to .America, where he
was the original Captain Molyneux in )‘The Shaugln
raun,” a matinee idol like Rignold* and Bellew.
James and Thorne put on Byron’s “Our Boys” at the
Vaudeville. A record money-maker. Ran nearly
four years at next to no expense. They only gave
Byron £7O for the piece right out. The perform-
ers, including Farren and Warner, were all cheap, as
things went. Our Australian acquaintance, Kate
Bishop, Marie Lohr’s mother, was one of the heroines.
The other was Amy Roselle. Then James and Thorne
staged “The School for Scandal,” as a stop-gap, the
cast including Farren, Neville, Clavton and luckless
Amy Fawsitt. Ran 400 fights! They next got
150 mghts out of an apparently used-up- thing like)
“London Assurance.” No further streak of. good'
fortune came to them, buf they retired satiated, like'
amiable leechek. I never heard of Thorne 'again,
James (Belasco) condescended to appear as Blurskin.,
with Leslie and Nellie Farren, in “Little Jack
Sheppard.” Thorne’s brother, Fred, acted Fluellen
2000 nights with Rignold’s “Henry V.” Afterwards,
he was at Melbourne Bijou,' with Mr, and Mrs.
G. B. W. Lewis. A sister, Sarah Thorne, was an
English provincial manageress, and Charley Mathews
died while engaged with her comnany. Tom Thorne
was good as Caleb Deecie, in “Two Roses,” Talbot
Champnevs in “Our Boys,” Sir Benjamin Backbite
and Dollv Spanker.

This time last year the “CHALMERS” CAR was unknown to Australia.
To-day there are 92 running, all sold within 12 months.
Eighty per cent, of these Cars have gone to Country Clients, because the Car
is now recognised throughout New South Wales as the most suitable Car for the
Stock and Station Agents, Hotelkeeper and Squatter, and the Run About for the
Professional Man.
You ask : Explain how it is the “CHALMERS” is acknowledged as the best Car
for Country Work?—Because they are high-powered, light, yet strongly built, and
cost very little for upkeep.
Refer to any of our Clients with respect to upkeep, and they will tell you how
they get from 6000 miles to 8000 miles on their tyres, and average 25 miles to
the gallon of petrol. Ask them what their repair bill has been. We know their
answer —Nil!
These facts justify the “CHALMERS” in being named the Champion Country
Car.

IN BANANA LAND
The Elections.
When the returns are all made up it will
probably be found that the Denham Govern-
ment is a fraction stronger than it was
before. If so, that is a material gain for the
uenham Government. Not so very long ago
its position seemed almost hopeless. It had
got into “holts” with the R.C. Church over
ihe Bible-in-Schools question. It had a
licensing problem on hand over which it
seemed to make plenty of enemies and no
friends. Its loan mongering was so reckless
that even the hardy i'hilp was alarmed. It
had very little personal popularity to help
it along. It used to be alleged that the absurd
and antiquated electoral system, under which
SD3 electors returned one member at Croydon
and 6477 electors returned one member at
\Voothakata, was specially designed to favor
the Tory interest; and when these inequali-
ties were swept away, and something dimly
resembling equality was introduced into the
Queensland electoral methods, many people,
reckoned that the Labor party would at last
get a show. It was thought by a great muli
titude, and with a semblance of reason, that
the Denham combination was on its death
bed. And then the General Strike gave it a
new lease of life. It is a sorrowful charac-
teristic of the Queensland State Labor party
that it generally commits suicide at the last
moment —sometimes a little earlier.
Now the question arises: What effect will
this trouble have on the fortunes of the Fed-
eral Labor party? In times past the Federal
Fabor party, which was suspected of being
a sane and well-balanced organisation, could
carry Queensland, while the quarrelsome and
riotous State Labor party never could. This
tjsed to be set down to the fact that, in the
Federal electorates, each vote represented
practically the same value, while in the State
electorates the values were insanely diverse.
Certainly there were remarkable discrep-
ancies even in the Federal arrangements, for
McDonald, of Kennedy, is member for 22,882
electors, while Bamford, of Herbert, stands
for 37.656, and Groom, of Darling Downs,
ffrr 33,506. Still the discrepancies were
never quite so bad as in State affairs. But
now, under a new State arrangement, which
is some approximation to the principle of
one-vote-one-value, State Labor has failed
utterly. It has failed, apparently, because of
the General Strike. And the Federal Prime
Minister/■ has needlessly and superfluously
associated himself with the General Strike
and the failure. He and his Postmaster-
General plunged into State politics, which
were none of their business, and drafted the
credit of their Ministry with them. They
lent themselves, quite voluntarily, to a cause
which has always been a losing one, and
which looked even less hopeful than usual.
Moreover, the State Labor leaders , had
rushed into the General Strike in preference
to waiting for the verdict of the Federal
Arbitration Court, and it was an ill-judged
business for the Federal leaders —the leaders
of a party which makes Arbitration one of
the principal planks of its platform-H:o hitch
their waggon to the falling star of the people
who had just treated their court and their
principles with such contumely.
A great deal might have been effected by a
plain straightforward declaration that the
General Strike was a mistake, and one which
would never be repeated. That was not done.
Bhe State Labor politicians found that it
was expected of them to defend the purpose-
less uprising for which many of them were in
nO way responsible. Andrew Fisher hardly
went so far as that. He stuck to generalities
and side issues. He dilated on the alleged
orderly conduct of the strikers, on the ab-
sqence of any real necessity for Federal mili-
tary interference, and on the unpleasant cir-
cumstances uiqder which the employees of the
Brisbane tramway company worked. All
these things were irrelevant. The issue was
whether, when the employees of a private
company or a private employer find their
bbss overbearing and disagreeable, it is justi-
fiable to declare war against all em-
ployers and the whole population—
against people who are no more responsible
for the doings of Tramway Manager Badger
or whoever else may be at fault than is
Fisher himself, or George V. of Great
Britain and Ireland, or the old woman who
liyed in a shoe. The policy looks like that of
tl>e Malay who, after a certain amount of
brooding ovier his personal grievance, de-
clares war .against everybody within reach
and runs aihok. If the General Strike idea
is adopted in a general way, then it seems
that all work, except that of non-union firms
whose men refuse to come out at the union
call, is liable to be stopped most of the time;
fpr there afe always grievances. There was
even a grievance, not long ago, and a strike
to boot, in the office of the Labor paper in
Sydney, and if that had led to an all-round
stoppage of industry, and a universal calling
out of unionists, and a blockade of the port,
it would have been a calamity.
So Andrew Fisher wandered into the
curious position of a man who dared not
wholly defend the policy of running amok—
a man who carefully, and eloquently side-
stepped the. problem of the hour, and yet
wa° lending all the assistance he could to the
party which ran amok, and which defended
its conduct in so doing. He didn’t save that
party, and he never had any hope of saving
it. And even if he could have lifted into
State office in Queensland the alleged Labor
leaders who turned their backs on the Labor
policy of arbitration, he would probably have
lost for Jhe present Australian Government
more support than he gained. As matters
stand, he has done as much as lie dared to
represent the Australian Labor Ministry as
a General Strike Ministry, and with-
out accomplishing any good for his
disastrous State friends he has done
a great deal of harm in other directions. If
a Federal election comes to pass before the
calamity blows over, the results may be
very bad indeed.
After 33 years’ observation of the unre-
pentant sinner from the Brisbane Bench.
Police Magistrate McGroarty retired a few
days ago. He faded out in a burst of ap-
preciation with a purse of brand new sove-
reigns as a proof of good faith.

Hunk of immortal truth from Brisbane
Courier : “As a matter of fact, Labor poli-
ticians have said more hard things of strike
promoters than the wliole of the Liberal
politicians of Queensland put together.” The
Labor politicians alluded to are Messrs.
Hughes, Pearce,. O’Malley, Beeby and Grif-
fifth. No Queensland State Labor politician
would have dared for his life to denounce
the late idiotic outburst known as the Gen-
eral Strike.
Premier Denham, being asked at Mary-
borough how he would repay the £14,000,000
of loans shortly falling due, replied that he
would meet the loans falling due by in-

Queensland was still true to the Constitu-
tion and still flying the grand old Union
Jack, and had no room for the red rag of
Revolution. The idea of meeting a
£14,000,000 liability ,by flying the grand old
Union Jack is novel, and if Uncle Cohen
will only be satisfied therewith, Queensland
will have every reason to be satisfied with
Uncle Cohen. The facial contortions of the
London Hebrew, who. oti demanding' his
money, is referred by Digfife Denham t,ri The
Union Jack, would make dq immortal pic-

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 27,. 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah,—-
The local representative of the Industrial
Union of Unemployed Governors has been
filling in his time-sheet by a visit to Too-
woomba in the company of Mrs. Ex. and the
Foxton aide. An inspection of the local cow
(four-legged), a dance at the Cory home, and
the laying of the foundation stone of the new
residence for nurses added to the gaiety of
the occasion. From Toowoomba, the exalted
unionist will convey his craft tools to Gym-
pie and Kingeroy, where several small jobs
await his attention.
Mrs. William Collins didn’t acquire the
Massareene pair for her house party, but
nevertheless her dance on Thursday night
was one of the brightest spots in Beaudesert
Show week. The decorations were good, and
the supper was calculated to make George
Reid dance a saraband. The hostess wore a
pink gown that left her sister woman with a
sinking and dissatisfied feeling. Her joyous
aspect was enhanced by the fact that her
ladv horse won the Bracelet at the races
earlier in the day.
The hamlet of Windsor, having recently
been sawn off the electorate represented by
that enlightened Liberal, Andrew Petrie, the
women of the place, or as many of them as
have suspicions that Andrew is all he is
cracked up to be by the Courier, presented
Mrs. Andrew with a neck string of precious
stones and a few other trifles in commemora-
tion of hubby’s services to the district. The
event was suitably framed with tea arid
buns, Mrs'. Petrie is a daughter of the late
Abe Luya, and has had a lot pf experience
in the political world. She' is,; also:a good
hoste'ss and a cheery citizen.
Dr. Gifford Croll and little Winnie Payne
(daughter of hospital secretary Payne and
sister of our clever girl-artist) vanished
quietly away on their wedding trip last week,
without any of the usual evidences of the
catastrophe. The vicinity was not even dis-
turbed by the whistle of an old boot. After-
wards, when all was safe, the numerous
friends of the escapees were lured to a
garden party at the Acclimatisation Gardens,
which have been transformed from an infuri-
ated wilderness to a plp.ce where fools and
angels might rush in without fear of the
consequences.
Next Tuesday pretty Rose Jardine will
sign up as Mrs. (Dr.) Eric Colle. The wed-
ding takes place at St. Peter’s Church, South-
port, and the, eating of the. cake will be
featured at the Berry mansion. Yesterday
cousin Dolly Jardine fed some 30 girleens in
honor of the forthcoming event, and did the
honors in a tailored suit of grey and a black
hat.' '■ •’ s ;
Miss Alice Laverack wedded, last Wedneg-
ney, Mr. Frank Jones, whose father was once
ah inspector of stock in your parts. : Her
own parent is a military gent. Two Sisters
and a brother were lent by the Laverack
clan to assist in the preliminaries. The wed-
ding breakfast; was scoffed at Heidelburg-
street,“East Brisbane, the bride’s old home.
After which a motor-car conveyed the em-
barrassed pair to the Seclusion of the North-
ern Rivers.
The William Anderson panto, has packed
up its fairy demons and flitted away to
make room for “The Quaker Girl.” The
bright, refulgent star in the panto, firma-
ment was baby Hill, a composed young lady
of seven summers an d almost as many
autumns,, who has pranced the boards for
the last three years. Her “big” song is
“Harrigan,” which, doubtless you remem-
ber. my dear, is the hilarious confessions of
a large, wild Irishman who wore dungarees
and No. 11 boots.
Yours affectiOflately,
Australia Jane.
Queensland State Assembly loses, on an
average, about 16 of its old members every
election. In 1904, when the old Philp party
was shattered, nearly 30 State politicians de-
parted from the Assembly—mostly for good,
and everybody said Toryism was gone for
ever. Thanks, however, to the tactics of'
Laborites of the Coyne brand, Conservatism
speedily rehabilitated itself.
Queensland’s statistics are sorrowful j
reading for the stout capitalists who groan
in and out of season that the climate is fit:
only for cheap niggers. Sapsford’s 1912
Almanac and Gazette, issued for Banana-,,
land’s Intelligence Bureau, sets out that the
death rate in the big State was, at the date
of last complete figures, the lowest in the
world. In 1910, the corpse record was
9.10 per 1000, as compared with 9.71 in
New South Wales, 9.71 in Westraiia, 9.71
in Maoriland, 9.72 in South Australia, 11.27
in Victoria, 11.35 in Tasmania, 14.5 in Nor-
way, 14.3 in Denmark, 14.7 in England and
Wales, 14.8 in Canada, 16.1 in Scotland,
17.6 in Ireland, IS.O in Germany, 19.0 in x
France, and 30.0 in Russia.
“Matrix”: When Prime M. Andy Fisher
visited Rockhampton recently, local Labor-
ites decided to do the proper thing by him. >
So besides the visiting speakers, a lady was
invited to give her experiences of the strike
trouble in Brisbane. Her time was limited
to five minutes, but this is what happened: —
When 10 o’clock arrived, and it was time for the
Federal Ministers to leave to catch the train, Mrs.
Willis was still speaking, and an intimation was
given to her that the time was up. She was under-
stood, however, to tell the Mayor not to interfere
with her, and she . resumed her speech. The Prime
Minister, Senator McGregor, and several , others on
the platform then left to go to the railway station; but .
Mrs. Willis merely waved them a friendly farewell,
and continued to address the meeting.
And yet some fools say the age of chivalry
had passed.
From the owner of the gun:—•
The facts about the cannon said to have belonged
to Cook’s ship Endeavor,' which was recovered re-
cently, are these: The gun, which is now in my
possession, was found near Cookto\vn 16 years ago, by
a Japanese, and placed ori the ketch Dart for ballast.
It was at that time covered with coral, but with
rough usage through the years, the coral has to a
considerable extent disappeared, for the last four
years the cannon has lain on Howard Smith s wharf,
Maekay, often buried under hundreds of tons of goal.
As a result of inquiry, fnade from the Admiralty, I
learn that an examination of Cook’s journal in con-
junction with the gunner’s log, places it beyond
doubt that, when the Endeavor took the reef near ;
Cook town, on the night of June 11, IDO, six car-
riage grins were thrown overboard to lighten her, and
I have no doubt that the particular . weapon is one
of the original six. But what I particularly wish to
know is whether Australia is going to allow this
relic of Cook’s voyage to leave the country? I am
ready to sell it, but, unless it is bought here, I shall
ship it to London within a few months.
On the other side of the case, there are the
facts that: (1) Cook (Wouldn’t have struck
on the so-called Endeavor reef, because his .
log shows that the accident happened further
south, near Cape Tribulation. Therefore
any cannon alleged to be found on
that reef (and this cannon has been so ;
alleged) was certainly not Cook’s. (2) There
were vast numbers of known (and probably •
any number of unknown) navigators there-
abouts, both before and after Cook, and pro- |
bsibly a dozen of them besides Cook threw
heavy stuff overboard while in trouble on.
the reefs of those parts, for it was the •
natural lot of the early navigator to get into
trouble in such badly charted and obstructed
waters. (3) The reefs were a great place
for old wrecks, and when a wreck perished, :
the cannon naturally fell out of it. (4)
There doesn’t seem a scintilla of evidence to
connect the old gun with Cook save the curi-
ous delusion that Cook was the first man
who pottered round the Australian coasts
instead'of being the hundredth, or perhaps
the five hundredth. Therefore any person
who sold a cannon as Cook’s merely because
he had no doubt it was Cook’s would take a
big risk of being called in later years a
trader in bogus relics.

Hunting Rifles
After them with a good re-
peating rifle! Be sure it’s
a Winchester, though, as
this rifle is reliable and
accurate. It is made in
calibers suitable for hunting
any size of game. The
Model 1892, made in .25-20, .32, .38 and .44 cal-
ibers, is widely used for Australian game. These
rifles are not expensive, although they are made to
get game and stand hard usage. The Winchester
.22 caliber Automatic and Winchester Model 1905
Self-Loading rifles, made in .32 and .35 calibers, are
also very popular among Australian hunters, as they
never fail. These rifles are very rapid in shooting
and unequalled as game
getters, being particularly
effective on running game,
as they can be held right on
the game while a succes-
sion of rapid shots is fired
with accuracy. Their system
of operation is simple and
they please in every way.

4 per cent, per annum, and are redeemable on June

BE STRONG on
SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Year after year Scott’s Emul-
sion maintains an unrivalled
reputation. Why? Just be-
cause no other emulsion
approaches SCOTT’S in purity,
quality or strength—or gives
such definite and certain results.
FOR
all weaknesses.
SCOTT’S Emulsion never fails.
Doctors recommend SCOTT’S.
Nurses praise SCOTT’S.
Mothers write to say how
valuable SCOTT’S has been
to their children. These are
reasons why you should make
sure you get only the genuine
article. SCOTT’S Emulsion is
as good_ for_ adults
as for_ children.
But it must be SCOTT’S. Imitations
may look the same, yet lack the purity
and strength which are essential fea-
tures of genuine SCOTT’S Emulsion
fgj
When you see the
name SCOTT’S
Emulsion on the

and this trade mark

KNOW you really

EAT AND BE
STROH6
To be well and strong you must eat food, and having
eaten it, you must digest it and so turn it into the material
of your own body. You cannot be well if your body is not
properly nourished, and it cannot be nourished if your food
does not digest perfectly. Indigestion (imperfect digestion)
will make you weak and ailing, subject to headaches,
stomach pains—very likely constipation, and certainly
discomfort after eating. Matters do not end there, for the
poisons, formed in your stomach from the stagnant mass of
food, will be drawn into your blood and carried to every
part of your body, thus weakening your system and
rendering you liable to more deadly diseases. Don’t hesitate.
Take Mother Seigel’s Syrup. It so strengthens the stomach
and liver that indigestion becomes impossible, and it
cleanses your system of all impurities.
STRENGTH COMES FROM FOOD
BUT IT MUST BE WELL DIGESTED
“My liTe was a misery. Everything l ate caused me more or less pain
and trouble. I also had pains in the chest, together with a sense of
great weight and oppression, as well as heartburn, wind, and other
distressing symptoms.
“ I tried ali sorts of medicines, but with no good results. After a few
days’ use of Mother Seigel’s Syrup I began to feel better. What I ate
began to nourish me instead of causing pain and distress. Six bottles
banished every trace of Indigestion, so that I have not suffered since.”—

The annual demonstration of Australian goods in
shop windows (which originated in Melbourne at the
instance of Charles Atkins, some years ago) is to
happen this year throughout the Commonwealth, dur-
ing the second week in October. Melbourne shopkeepers
hitherto have “featured” Australian manufactures early
in September, at Agricultural Show time. The altera-
tion in the date was agreed upon in order to secure
co-operation of effort in the States. For one week, at
least, in every year, the retailers—mostly drapers and
tailors—who don’t display the patriotic ticket will
escape the patronage of every self-respecting Aus-
tralian on the continent.

By an Act it has, Bananaland recently struck
136 mining cos. off the register. Among the
deceased may be noted many that were to do big
things, and only did their shareholders. One is
Callan’s Knob, a show to the west of Mount Morgan,
which was to be second wonder.
* * » *
Ihe Victorian Chamber of Manufactures 1 lately
clamored re the failure of the inter-State cos., in this
time of prosperity and bounding loan money, to pro-
vide sufficient cargo space on their boats. The ship-
ping bosses made about 16 different retorts, of which
the most interesting were (1) that the Commonwealth
trade varies tremendously, and that the hot and busy
ship of to-day may be the cold and barnacled hulk of
to-morrow, and (2) that nearly every company is
having new ships built, “though there is a suspicion
in shipping circles that, by the time the additional
tonnage is available, the boom may have passed by,
depression have set in, and the new vessels be left idle
at their moorings.” If the doleful vision is realised,
the moored idlers will all represent money lost to
Australia. The Australian fleets have almost been
built over again within the last 10 years, and not a
rivet on a single vessel of any size has been supplied
or driven by an Australian. Two or three of the im-
ports have provided notable sea tragedies and
drowned a few hundreds of their purchasers; but that
is about all this country has got out of them. For
want of a stiff import duty on ships, a fine chance
to establish the industry while the Commonwealth
was young has gone into the obliterated past.

Briner : In the midst of the coal strike there ap-
peared in the London docks the greatest naval wonder
day—the Danish-built oil steamer Selandia,
6000 tons. It had navigated from Copenhagen to
Antwerp, and thence to London, in some bad weather
with complete success. It was ultimately bound for
Bangkok, Siam, and will trade between that place
ar jd Copenhagen. This vessel burns nothing but oil
which is stored at the bottom. There are no funnels.
No vibration is experienced, nor is there any smell
Good speed is attained, and apparently the best of
coal-speed can be equalled with suitable machinery,
the expense of oil does not exceed that of coal, but
the grand saving is in the engineers, with about one-
third of the staff. Enough oil can be carried for a
complete round voyage, that is to say, Copenhagen to
Bangkok and back. The fuel can be shipped at the
cheapest places. The Selandia will take i i its next
stock at Borneo. The Antwerp pilot said that in 46
years experience he never handled a ship that an-
swered its helm so beautifully. Several other big
oil steamers are building, and doubtless one may be
expected soon in Port Jackson and Hobson’s Bay.
The British Admiralty has been satisfied for some
time that oil will answer for any war vessel. The
only drawback is that a sufficient supply cannot be
obtained from British dominions.

“Homo”: A recent copy of the Victorian Govern-
ment Gazette contains six closely-printed pages of
this kind of thing in regard to various parcels of land
in the vicinity of Melbourne:—
“PROCLAMATION.
“By his Excellency, Sir John Michael Fleetwood
Fuller (with the usual string of baubles).
“Whereas by deed poll bearing date the tenth day
of December in the year of our Lord One thousand
eight hundred and fifty-three under the hand of
Charles Joseph La Trobe the Officer administering the
Government of the Colony of Victoria (much frill
omitted) there was granted subjeet to the reservations
thereinafter mentioned unto William John Turner
Clarke of Melbourne his heirs and assigns all that
piece or parcel of land (long hunk of misery cut out)
in the County of Bourke parish of Cut-paw-
paw allotment so-and-so (lengthy description)
to hold the same unto the said William (&c.)
his heirs and assigns for ever yielding and
paying therefor yearly the quit rent of one
peppercorn for ever if demanded. Provided neverthe-
less and there was thereby reserved unto our late
Most Gracious Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria her
heirs and successors (inter alia) all such parts and so
much of the said land as might thereafter be required
for making public ways canals or railroads in over
and through the same to be set out by the Lieutenant-
Governor for the time being of the said Colony or
some person by him authorised in that respect.”
This is followed by a herd of “whereases,” “now
therefores,” “aforesaids,” and such-like, dragging in
the statement that portions of the earth referred to
are now required for making railroads and increasing
the unearned increment. To put it shortly, the time
was up, and the Devil had called for the soul as per
agreement. But the Devil doesn’t make so much cir-
cumlocution. All he wants is a glare of blue flame
and a tail.

“McK.”: To the Aboliar in Bulletin (14/3/’l2)
who had a good word to say for the despised grftss-
tree, I extend the hand of unanimous support. In
the Heytesbury forest, near Cobden (Vic.), there are
thousands of acres of plains, and a com-
pany is on the job to exploit the commercial products
of the vegetable. In any shop at Colac (Vic.) the
varnish can be bought for Is. a pint bottle, and an
enterprising undertaker told me that it has no equal
for polishing up coffins for customers in a hurry.
Also, a bush-whacker from Gellibrand River has
evolved a boot polish and a powerful explosive from
the gum of the grass-tree.
THE KISS CURLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Practically all the pigtails formerly worn by Aus-
tralian Chinese have been shorn, and the crop has
been forwarded to China to be worked up to meet
the enormous European demand for human hair.
—Daily paper.
Pete Peters is Australi-an.
Intensely “white,” he loathes too much
The small, brown party from Japan,
And cannot bear to see or touch
The yellow Chow, or any such.
He would impose a crushing tax
On yellows, reds, and browns and blacks.
It’s further needful here to state
There is a little lady whom
Pete loves full well. She’s fair as day,
Her hair is like the wattle bloom,
Her eyes like living sapphires loom
O’er cheeks of vellum, soft and sweet;
Kissed only by the sun, and Pete.
Pete totes his dear around a lot,
They part where one big palm unfurls,
And mother’s prying eyes are not,
And there he’ll kiss his best of girls,
But kisses most her fair kiss-curls.
He doesn’t know, I’ve quite decided,
They're Ling Fat’s pigtail peroxided !

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them—the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
Ip
fv
<Pu‘
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
hrace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
1 >cst adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums da}' and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We d» not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

CONSTIPATION CONQUERED.
There lies the vital secret where so many diseases and ailments are
concerned Constipation must be conquered, or normal organic action,
freedom from liver and kidney troubles, and from stomach and bowel
disorders, is not possible.
Cockle s Pills conquer Constipation of the most stubbornly aggressive
kind; because they strengthen and stimulate and revivify the organs,
which they cleanse and regulate with such consummate ease and efficiency.
The whole system is freed from the wholesale disturbance due to the con-
stipated tendency, from blood impurities, from effete matter, from lurking
disease. Yet Cockle’s Pills act so gently and pleasingly that the most
delicate persons like them. 1

■DOCTOR PRESCRIBES ZAM-BUK-
CHild’s Terrible Scald—FlesH Was Half-CooKed and
Red-Raw—9 Months’ Frightful Suffering from Open
Sores, Which Would Not Heal.
A MOTHER'S INTERESTING STORY.
&
< mi?
r A
l I1ABV GREEN,
"•> cured by Zaui-link.
HE hospital doctor recommended
1 Zam-Buk to Mrs. G. Green, of
57 Thomas Street, Camperdown,
Sydney, for a terrible scald sus=
tained by her little boy, and such
professional recommendation proves
the marvellous superiority of Zam-
Buk over all ointments and salves.
Mrs. Green says :
“My little boy, John, was nearly scalded to
death through a kettle of boiling water up-
setting over him. Xke shock almost slopped
his heart beating. The whole of his left side
was in a terrible state, and we tnought he
would succumb to his injuries. It was an
anxious time for me, I can assure you. He
was in terrible agony; his flesh was half-
cooked, the skin peeled off, and he was red
raw. Many home treatments were tried, and
although we did all we could to get rid of the
great sores which formed all down his body
as a result of the scald, they would not heal,
and the poor little fellow suffered for nine
long months.
“I took him to the hospital, and after at-
tending to the wounds, the Doctor recom-
mended me to use Zam-Buk for home treat-
ment. Acting under his instructions, I pur-
chased a pot of this splendid Balm, and
applied it to the sores night and morning,
until, presently, signs of improvement were
noticed. The Zam-Buk cooled the irritation
be the means or uoing good to omers, wr
be aware of the benefits to be derived from this famous Balm, which we enthusiast!-
nollv rpcmnnnAnfl In *l.ll
cally recommend to all.’
Every Home Needs Zam-Buk
Zam-Buk is unequalled for cuts, bruises, burns, scalds, rash, sunburn, sore feet,
pimples, blackheads, boils, eczema, piles, sprains, stiffness, bad legs, scabs, scalp
diseases, poisoned wounds, rigworm, baby’s teething, sores and rashes, barber s rash,
and other disorders of the skin and tissues. Zam-Buk is obtainable from all chemists
and stores, at 1/8 per pot, or 3/6 large family size (containing nearly four times the
1/6 pot) ; or direct from The Zam-Buk Co., 39 Pitt Street, Sydney.

PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion*
The Message of the Sunset.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE is a lazy, luring land that calls
me night and day —
“Come back to me, my rover” —and
it’s hard to answer nay !
its whisper wanders round the world, and
through the world’s unrest:
"“Come back, and lay your weary head upon
my soft warm breast —
Oh, come back to me, my son,
Ere your youthful days be done,
And know the Desert Mother loves her way-
ward children best.”
Its distances are like the voids that stretch
between the stars,
When Darkness, in her velvet cloak, the
Gate of God unbars ;
As vague, and as mysterious—and yet that
time I trod
Those lone, unmeasured distances, they
brought me nearer God—
To the God I long had left —
To my manhood mother-weft —
Though I wore no robes of purple, and I
bore no magic rod.
A doleful eerie land it is, right to its border
line —-
But Oh! its blooms are wonderful, and redder
than red wine!
Those desert ways whose sombre orbs are
blacker than the night—
And yet their radiance is like the sable
opal’s light.
(Oh, their tangling tendrils twine
Round this weary heart o’ mine,
As dear arms clasped Ulysses when Minerva
masked his might.)
Out there the salt-shrubs softly spread their
gowns of guiltless green ;
While here and there, in hide and seek, a
bluebush peeps between.
And lonely on a ridge’s crest, like fairy
fronds of old,
A quandong tree is pendulous with fruit of
gleaming gold.
And, flame-flashing in the leaves,
Do! a painted minah weaves
A madrigal of thankfulness for favors mani-
fold.
That land is calling, calling, with a voice as
honey-sweet
As the breath of mountain roses when the
snow and summer meet;
And as sweet as songs of sirens, sung on
shelly, sylvan shores,
When the sleepy starlight stencils through
the swaying sycamores.
And it’s saying: “Oh, return
Where the silver sunlights burn
Their mystic mirage tapers in my frankin-
censed boudoirs.”
I have seen its stars reflected in the blue of
alien streams;
It has splashed its pinks and purples in the
fabric of my dreams.
It is Stentor’s ceaseless calling! It is Didc’s
deep desire !
And Ixion-like it wanders on the wheeling
winds of fire!
But no martial Mercury
Sends dread messages to me;
For Dove and Trust, red-hearted, are the
Sunset’s calling choir.
Its mother-call has carried o’er the spindrift
of the seas ;
It has flown a flag of fancy on the mast-
heads by the quays;
I have heard the shy stars’ whisper, and the
message of the moon,
Where the mountains, snow-pavilion’d, in
the scudding showers do swoon.
And its call was always this:
“Son o’ mine, your face I miss..
Say you’re coming—say you’re coming in the
season that is soon!”
I can hear its pleadings lifted on each
scented breeze that blows;
I can see i.ts secrets written in the petals of
the rose;
I can see its roads far-stretching in a sandy,
smoky maze
When the lights of pier and palace round the
harbor’s edges blaze —
And it’s settled ; I’ll go back
By a sunset-tinted track—
For when that mother calls him home the
wanderer obeys!
n.s.w.
R. J. CASSIDY.
The Evolution of Divinia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DIVINIA lay in her little, white bed,
tossing enviously. The murmur of
the suppressed revelry from Danger’s
room percolated through the walls, filling her
isoul with discontent. For in Danger’s room
the two telephone girls were supping on
.crayfish and white wine, and the gurgle and
murmur suggested that they were having a
good time.
Dying there, Divinia reasoned out that the
Respectability which prevented a girl having
supper with a number of other girls in a man’s
room was a form of tyranny that no logic
.or reason could justify. She knew the two
telephone girls were in wrappers, and she
was also certain that they had their hair
.done up with bands of bright velvet ribbon.
But, after all, where did the harm come in?
There might be some objections to urge
against a girl going to such a supper alone,
hut with two others it was absurd. She felt
inclined to get up, find her macintosh, steal
out, and ask to be allowed to join.
She got out of bed and softly reached her
door. But just then Danger’s door opened.
There were whispered jokes and repartee, a
soft good-night, and something that sounded
like a kiss repeated.
A fearful feeling of curiosity stole over
her. She was sure he had kissed both the
girls—and had she been there he would
probably have kissed her too. She felt the
blood surge to her face at the thought.
For Divinia was 22 and had never yet been
kissed by a man. Then she felt herself im-
pelled to listen at the door of the soft-eyed
girl whose face had always recalled the pic-
ture of the Madonna in the convent school-
room. This girl had a face tliai was almost
divine; and yet she drank wine, ate cray-
fish, and (Divinia was sure of it) smoked
cigarettes—all in a man’s room. All her
life Divinia had been told that once she
stepped off the diamond ridge of propriety
her face would show it. Yet no one would
have dreamed that Bella Gray ever smoked,
and to Divinia’s mind smoking was more
than risque—it was abandoned.
While these ideas were plunging through
her brain she was standing in her doorway,
afraid to go forward to listen, unable to go
back. She put her naked foot out on the cold
linoleum of the landing floor, and the chill
stabbed her like a pain. She stepped back
to the bedside and fumbled for her stock-
ings, and once more crept forth.
Danger’s door was open. The moonlight
of the winter night streamed into the room
and showed dimly the handsome pagan with
the clothes tucked up round his chin, appar-
ently fast asleep. She looked in, fascinated.
His long, regular breathing assured her he
was really sleeping. On the table stood a
long-necked bottle, but all other traces of the
supper had been removed.
That long-necked bottle bewitched Divinia.
Only at the Sacrament had she ever tasted
wine, excepting the kinds which are brewed
at home of gooseberries and red currants,
and these, needless to say, she regarded as
mere makeshifts.
Before she knew what had happened she
found herself right in the room, and her fing-
ers closing on the neck of the bottle. Silently
she lifted it from the table and departed,
looking at Langer’s curly hair as she went,
and, still hugging her prize, reached her own
apartment. She poured out what remained
of the wine. For a moment she watched it
apprehensively, half expecting something to
happen—the appearance of the Devil, per-
haps. Then a sudden wave of recklessness
swept over her, and, waving the glass to-
wards where Danger lay beyond the wall,
she drank his health. Then she bounded
into bed, drew the clothes up round her chin,
and lay and trembled with delight at her es-
capade. She had had a real adventure—had
put her head into the lion’s mouth, and es-
caped unhurt. And the heavens refused to
fall.
* * * *
The one thing wanting to complete her
happiness was a confidante, and as they
walked home from school that evening she
confided in Miss Hayes. That lady’s eyes
danced, and she persuaded Divinia to step
inside and have a cup of tea. Once in the
seclusion of her sitting-room, she placed her
hand on Divinia’s head.
“My dear, you’re in love! But do not
allow your heart to run away with your
head.”
“I don’t think I’m in love with Mr.
Danger, but I do think that he and I are
affinities, or at least that he is my affinity,
although he shows no sign of feeling that
way. Could he by any chance be my affin-
ity and I not his?” she asked in sudden
alarm.
Miss Hayes smiled, and then broke into
a little laugh.
“Divinia, there’s only one thing to be
done when you find an affinity!”
“And that is?”
“Get away where you won’t see him, and
he’ll forget you.”
Divinia was stricken dumb.
"I’m going to tell you something,” Miss
Dlayes went on. “I’m not a miss at all.
I’m a married woman.” She opened her
purse and drew out a plain gold circlet.
“There is my wedding ring!”
“Where —that is—l mean, were you not
happy?”
“Happy! I was in paradise while it
lasted. The trouble is that it never does
last. Now I live on my recollections. It’s
nice to have remembrances that glitter, Di-
vinia, even though they do sometimes torture
you by suggesting comparisons. I would not
part with mine, and I am glad that I have
eaten of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.”
Divinia arrayed herself in a dark-red
wrapper that lent a glory and a sheen to her
jetty hair and brown complexion. Having
made each bow and ribbon take its part in
the scheme of things, she stole into Danger’s
room to pose before the full-length mirror.
She walked in and lit the gas, and glanced
around apprehensively, for fear he might
have entered without her hearing him.
She felt tremendously wicked and adventur-
ous. Not till she saw her reflection in that;
full-length mirror did she understand how
art finishes nature. She was wondering
how to contrive that Danger should see her
in this costume when he entered. She
blushed and apologised, and offered confused
explanations. He looked at the wrapper
critically, and from various angles. He also
looked at her.
“It is an exquisite effect,” he said. “I
would like to paint a portrait of you in that,
if you will sit?”
That was the beginning of the new order
of things.
He finished the portrait, and finished it
very badly, in six sittings, and every night
she had supper with him and the telephone
girls. She found it was a most decorous
business, and, if there had been any kissing
before she came, there was none afterwards.
Merely a little meal brightened up with
sparkling conversation, and then a last round
of the white wine, and away to bed. It was
almost a disappointment. She had hoped
for at least a suspicion of wickedness.
And then it all came to a sudden end, for
Danger was suddenly transferred to the sub-
tropical north. He left Divinia’s portrait
with her. and, when he said good-bye, he
took both her hands in his, looked into her
eyes, and whispered that he was never so
sorrv to leave any place before. For a
moment she stood limp, blushing, with a
moist feeling in her eyes, and then impul-
sively she held her face up, but. before he
could kiss her, she had wrenched herself
free and darted upstairs. As he drove away
he saw a scarf waved from her window by
a red-sleeved arm.
“What a pity it didn’t begin sooner,” he
said as he neared the railway station.
* * * *
Seven years later Danger was on his way
down the Maoriland coast. The night was
dirty, and, having had a wild time of it in
Wellington, he had gone to bed early. He
was roused from his sleep by a trembling
(Continued on next page.J

SYDNEY MAN CURED
After Three Years of Suffering.
Mr. John Loaney, 26 Swanson Street, Erskineville, Sydney, states: “I wish to give you
particulars of my experience with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I owe these pills a debt of
gratitude, for they have cured me of very serious kidney disease. My ill-health commenced
three years ago, when I first had to lay up. I had terrible pains in my back and right side, and
my secretions scalded, and were thick and contained sedimentary matter. I also had fits of gid-
diness, and every day I would have a violent headache. For two years I spent an average of two
weeks out of every three in bed, and even when up I was very ill. I was very weak and fell
away. I had the best medical advice and treatment to be procured; 10 leading Sydney physicians
treated me in the three years of my illness, their bills totalled £lBO. The general idea was that
I suffered with stone in the kidneys, and I was constantly advised to undergo an operation. At
last a specialist put me under the X-rays. He found no foreign substance in the kidneys, but a
dark veil enveloped the right kidney, showing pronounced disease. He told me that it was un-
necessary to be operated on, as my kidneys were too far gone for an operation to benefit me. I
gave up all hope of recovery, and fully expected to die soon, and my friends were of the same
opinion. My lawyer was brought home, and made out my will. I was held up to sign'it. Not
long after this I was advised to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. The man who urged me to
give this remedy a trial had been cured by it, and had the utmost faith in its healing proper-
ties. He told me he had been doubled up with the ailment, and not able to get about
at all, and one bottle had cured him, and for good. One could not but be convinced
that he was in thorough earnest, so I sent for a supply to Ellis’s Pharmacy, Erskine-
ville. I used nine bottles, and was cured. I felt no good effects until I was using the
third bottle; but after that my recovery was gradual. I left off taking the pills four months
ago, and have not needed to take one since, and am still in the best of health. My case is the
more marvellous in that I am an aged man. The medicine I took before I got Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills would stock a chemist’s shop. I had fallen away five inches round the waist, but
I have regained all the lost weight. I might mention that the operation which had been suggested
was to cost me £6O. My cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cost me less than 30s. If
I had used these Pills when I first got ill, I would be considerably over £2OO richer to-day. My
recovery is well known, and may be authenticated by many, but if any sufferer would like to call,
I shall be glad to substantiate this testimonial.”
Seven years later Mr. Loaney says: “I am pleased to be able to tell you the cure effected by
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, over seven years ago, has proved permanent. I am still well, and
have had no return of my old trouble during all that time. My lasting cure speaks volumes for
the merit of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”

BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
PILES.
A LASTING CURE BY
DOAN'S OINTMENT.
Mr. Edgar Wood, Coogee Street, Randwick, says: “For 17 years I suffered with itching and
protruding piles. During that time I was treated by several well-known Sydney doctors. I also
tried chemists’ prescriptions, and used every remedy advertised to cure this complaint, but nothing
gave me the slightest relief. The irritation was so great that it caused me annoyance during the
day, and kept me awake for hours at night. I almost despaired of ever getting anything to
relieve me, as I had experienced so many failures. However, I saw an article in the paper stating
that Doan’s Ointment had cured a well-known Sydney man, who had suffered with this com-
plaint for 20 years. I at once got this Ointment, and am very pleased to tell you that the first
application gave me relief. I continued using it until I was perfectly cured. My cure means a
lot to me, and is wonderful after suffering for 17 years. I wish you to publish this statement,
so that people suffering with Piles may know the value of Doan's Ointment.”
Mr. Wood, says nine years after the above was given: “I am still free of Piles. Doan's
Ointment made’ a perfect cure in my case, for I have been free of Itching and Protruding Piles
for the past nine years.”
DOAN’S OINTMENT is sold by all Chemists & Storekeepers at 2/9 per pot.
steward, who banded him a lifebelt and said
something about putting it ou and trusting
God. When Langer heard a steward talk
that way he rose hastily, for the case must
be indeed desperate. Stewards are not a de-
vout race.
He strapped the thing on and went out
into the saloon, where the electric light burn-
ed as tranquilly as though the engines were
not broken down and the Kaikoura coast
was a hundred miles away. On the deck
Pandemonium raged, and as he progressed
towards the companion-way Langer began
to have grave doubts as to the truth of the
statement that Britons always know how to
die fair deaths. He had seen a lot of oxen
go to their end with more dignity than his
fellow-countrymen were displaying that
night, if the noise overhead was any cri-
terion.
As he passed the bar he noticed that the
black-moustached waiter in charge was
armed.
“Anything serious, George?” he said.
“Yessir. We’re on a blanky rock off the
Kaikouras, an’, as far as I can see, there’s
mighty little chance getting ashore. Take a
tip—stick to the ship. No boat could live
in the sea that’s running, especially when
filled with scared land lubbers and women.”
“Well, give me a flask. It might come
handy in the water, you know.’
George passed over two, and then two
more.
“Stow one in each pocket, Mr. Langer.
Some of ’em’s sure to get smashed. Never
mind the money. I guess I won’t have to
render any account for this trip. And I’ve
got all the money in my pockets that I rec-
kon I’m likely to carry.”
Then George poured something into a
couple of glasses, and held one out to Langer.
The other he drained himself.
“Here’s luck, in this world or the next.
Now you get upstairs, in case you’re drowned
like a trapped rat down here. And as he
spoke the electric light suddenly trembled
right out.
Langer struggled up the staircase by the
dim light of sundry oil lamps. At the top
he found a woman trembling and sick with
fear. As he appeared she sprang at him,
folded her arms round his neck, and burst
out
“Oh, I knew you would come! I knew
you would come!”
But Langer did not want any newly-found
friends just then. Under any circumstances
his plight was just about hopeless. Burdened
with a woman he would have no chance at
all. He pushed her off.
“No you don’t, my girl. I never saw you
before in my life.” But, as she recoiled, the
light of a swinging lamp fell on her face, and
Langer stepped forward and took her in his
arms. I
“Divinia, Divinia! I didn’t recognise
you. Forgive me. How was I to expect
you in this inferno. I thought you were
2000 miles away.”
“I knew that you would come to me. I
always felt I should see you again before I
died.” she gurgled, nestling closer to him.
“Well, my dear, for your sake I wish you
had been disappointed. Why have you no
lifebelt?”
“I was trying to fasten it on when a man
wrenched it from me and fled on deck.”
“The brute ! Well, I’ll get you one.”
He turned to descend the stairs. She clung
to him.
“Don’t leave me, dear. Don’t leave me!
“Well, come with me.”
Down into the saloon they struggled,
and found themselves knee-deep in water.
George was just leaving. Langer asked him
for a lifebelt, and he dived into a cabin and
returned with two. One of these was fast-
ened to the trembling girl.
“It’s a case of stick to the ship, I guess,”
said George, looking round when they reached
the deck; and then he went forward. That
was the last they saw of him. Far over the
waves other lights answered them, and an-
other ship toiled and rolled towards them.
“There’s a ship coming to save us, Har-
old !” she screamed in the endeavor to make
herself heard above the howling of the gale.
“They can’t come here,” he said, “and no
boats can leave. They’ll be smashed. We’re
right on the reef. Come up here and wait
with what patience you can, sweetheart!”
So they climbed as close to the great fun-
nel as they could, and, after finding a se-
cluded spot he gave her a long draught from
one of the flasks.
Below them on the deck the sailors were
toiling at a great raft, which they hoped
would keep the majority of the people
afloat. But it was too late. The steamer,
rolling and plunging over the jagged reef,
driven forward by the force of the waves
and the wind, was literally torn to pieces,
and, reaching the edge of the rock, it rolled
over into deep water.
The suddenness of that plunge took them
by surprise. Grasping at her desperately,
he twined one hand in her long hair, and
held on by sheer force of will as they were
sucked down with the sinking ship. Then
the downward motion ceased. He was being
suffocated. He knew they were shooting
skyward, but would they reach the surface
in time? His grip on the girl’s hair relaxed,
and then the cut of the wind and spray told
him thev were at the top. He opened his
mouth and swallowed a gallon. He closed
it again, and breathed through his nose, and
then managed to lift Divinia up so that she
could get a breath. Her fingers closed on
him like a vyce, and he knew she still lived.
Something bumped him heavily—and •yvdth
his free hand he laid hold of it, and found
it to be a lifebuoy. After a struggle he got
it right over her, and slipped it under her
arms, and then, taking a tight grip of the
cord on the side, he settled down to wait for
the dawn.
He knew the current was bearing them
away from the scene of the wreck. Millions
of tons of water seemed to roll over them at
intervals. They were buffeted about, their
throats became almost paralysed, and at
times Langer felt inclined to dive and end
it. But the belt and the buoy kept him up,
and he knew he could not sink if he would.
And it suddenly rushed upon him that it is
not necessary to sink under the water to
drown. He knew he was being slowly
drowned.
The sound of breakers reached them at in-
tervals. Langer knew they were sweeping
along the coast, and might be dashed to
pieces among the rocks at any moment. It
was useless to struggle. They were helnless
and must , just go as the current bore them.
He no longer felt the cold. The noise of the
waves became musical, and he seemed to
drift lightly. Suddenly the water was full
of sand, and they were being swept along at
a fearful speed. He heard Divinia shriek,
and then a great concussion seemed to stun
and yet half rouse him. He tried to dig his
heels into the rattling shingle. For a mo-
ment the backwash seemed to lose power,
and another crossing breaker gripped them,
hurled them far up the beach, and tried
vainly to suck them back. He got half a
dozen deep breaths, and then turned to feel
for Divinia. She had gone.
He struggled to his feet and opened his
eyes. He stood alone on a black, shingle
beach. He caught one fleeting glimpse of
raging ocean, a great frowning headland,
and some distant lights. Then it all sud-
denly dipped like a dream landscape, and
darkness fell like a curtain.
When he awoke he was in a low-roofed hut
on a mat. Around him were Maoris, one of
whom was trying to give him some soup in a
cup. He sat up suddenly and glared around,
only to sink back satisfied. For, on a rough
bed, he saw Divinia, also sitting up to take
soup. He wanted nothing more. He let
the soup run down his throat, and felt it
warm him and do him good. Then he turned
over on his side and sank into a great sleep.
Miss Hayes opened the long-promised let-
ter. There was nearly a ream of it, all writ-
ten in a close, pointed hand :
You remember what you once told me about affini-
ties. It is quite true. I was thrown into his arms
by that shipwreck, and while it lasted it was
heavenly. Shall I ever forget that time they thought
us drowned ! But what you said about it never last-
ing was true. This man who had fought to save me
from the ocean would not fight to save me from my
husband. He did not seem worried about the hus-
band, but when he heard about the twins he became
very upset, and at last he said I had better go back
for their sakes. We went back to Wellington to-
gether, and there I met George, and confessed every-
thing. 1 thought he would divorce me. But he
didn’t. I told him I could never love him again.
He said very sweetly that in that case I must live
for the children. Mr. Langer would, I know, marry
me if George would divorce me. But George won’t.
And there it is. George wont to see Mr. Langer, and
had quite a long talk with him. He told me they
got on splendidly together.
I stood it for three months, and then I went to
Wellington to see Mr. Langer, to tell him I would
stay with him. But he was out of town, and George
overtook me before I could find him. Of course, he
took me home, and when I said I would not remain
with him, he beat me with the razor-strop. Every
time I tried to assert myself after that he beat me
with it again. Now lam quite subdued. I see that
Mr. Langer does not want me, for, although none of
my letters have been returned through the post, he
never replies. The other day George told me he had
been married, and I believe it was to one of those
wretched girls—one of those that used to smoke in
his room after the supper—Miss Bella Gray, I think
was her name. Like you, dear, lam going to live
on my recollections. I have had my romance, and it
must be my solace. What strange creatures these
men are! When you get your Christmas holidays,
come up here and stay with me. I have so much to
talk to you about.
C. A. JEFFRIES.
Loquacity of Tom and Dick.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OM Morrissey was the short, bow-
legged, scrubby man who lived in the
dark house on the outskirts of
Waddy, the house surrounded with a high,
close fence enclosing a rampart of black fir
trees. Tom was a bachelor and a retiring
man, slow of movement, slower of speech.
He worked at the yards three days in the
week, did odd jobs about the pound, and oc-
casionally killed and trimmed old beasts for
Kyley, the dog trainer, who ran a sort of
seminary for sleek, aristocratic greyhounds
at the lower end of the township, where
Waddy tailed off into the trees. When he
had nothing else to do, Morrissey cultivated
delicious vegetables, largely for the pleasure
of giving them away, for Tom was a kindly
soul, and no family escaped his attentions.
The hatter’s method of making a present
was characteristic. He would pile cab-
bages, potatoes, fruit, or a hunk of bacon or
fresh pork on the doorstep, then knock
loudly at the door and clear out as if the
Devil were chasing him.
a. nod was Tom Morrissey’s customary
salutation. If he said “Good day” he felt
that he was growing discursive, and shut up
for a whole week. People who had lived
within a hundred yards of Tom for 10 years
had never exchanged a dozen words with
him at one time.
When Colen’s house was burnt down,
Tom pitched a tent outside his own fence,
and turned his whole house and its contents
over to the Colen family, till such time as
Colen would build again. And he did it
with two words. “Get in,” he said.
One sale day a fierce red bullock got away
from a mob, and loped after a lame swag-
man on the flat. It hooked him, broke
two ribs, ripped him a bit, and bruised him
badly. Tom carried the injured man into
his house, had a doctor to him, and nursed
and tended him for five weeks. During
those five weeks no words worth mentioning
passed between Tom and his patient. The
sick man was not more garrulous than Mor-
rissey. “Thenk yeh, mate,” was his most
eloquent remark.
When the patient was quite well he burst
out with :—-
“Well, I reckon I better be goin’.”
“ ’S no hurry,” said Morrissey.
Next morning the stranger came out of
Tom’s front gate, with bluey up, shook hands
slowly with Tom, and paced off five yards.
Then he turned, and paced back.
“Wha’s yer name, mate?” he said.
“Morrissey.”
“My name’s Morrissey, too.”
“Get out!”
“S’elp me. I come from Oldham. Old
man was a weaver at Mayall’s mills.”
“Then you must be my brother Dick.”
“Then you’re Tom.”
They shook hands again, loitered a mo-
ment, and Diok said- “Well, so long, Tom.”
“So long. Dick.” said Tom.
And Dick went off into the great spaces
again.
