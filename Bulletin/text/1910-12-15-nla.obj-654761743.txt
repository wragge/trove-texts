THE RED PAGE
A Retrospect
AS this year closes a decade it makes
a handy stopping-place from which
to look back upon Australia’s per-
formances in literature. It happens, also,
that it is just a century ago since the first
Australian verse struggled into print.
The birthstains on our history appear
also in our literature, for the first pro-
“BANJO” PAPERSON
on his Geebung polo pony "Pegasus."
duct of the local press with any preten-
sions to literary form was the Royal
Birthday Ode of an ex-convict named
Michael Robinson.
Since 1810 there has been an output of
verse which is disproportionately large
for such a small community. Certainly,
much of it was dead at birth, and for
70 years the best of it was imitative.
Out of the lot, some verses by Gordon
and Kendall (with a novel by Marcus
Clarke) had gained credit abroad ; while
a local reputation was precariously held
by two or three other writers.
The position of affairs at the time of
Kendall’s death in 1882 is stated in a
quaint paragraph of R. E. Twopeny’s
Town Life in Australia (London, 1883):
Strictly speaking, there has not, and can-
not yet be, any such thing as an Australian
literature. Such writers as live in Australia
are nearly all English born and bred, arid
draw their inspiration from English sources.
HENRY LAWSON.
A new country offers few subjects for poetry
and romance, and prophecy is by no means
so inspiring as the relation of the great
deeds of the past. But yet there has been
at least one amongst us who may claim
to have had the real poetical afflatus,
and whose subjects were invariably taken
from the events of the life around him.
This was Thomas Gordon, the author ol
“How We Beat the Favorite ” and several
other short pieces of verse of rare merit
and redolent of the Australian air. Georye
Brunton Stephens is another versifier who
at times showed signs of genius, and it is not
long since Mr. Horace Kendall died, who
ran off sheets of graceful verses with con-
siderable talent and no little poetic fancy.
This slapdash criticism, with the poets’
names all awry, is characteristic of the
time. Yet in the work mentioned by Two-
peny, though it was fashioned on old-
world models, there are the first faint signs
of a national literature. They are, to para-
phrase Marcus Clarke, the scribblings of
Australia learning to write. There was
no Australian literature, and there were
no Australian readers. Essex Evans was
later on to prophesy :
Not as the songs of other lands
Her song shall be,
Where dim her purple shore line stands
Above the sea !
As erst she stood, she stands alone;
Her inspiration is her own.
From sunlit plains to mangrove strands,
Not as the songs of other lands
Her song shall be.
The Bulletin began the work of en-
couraging literature out of the young
bushmen with brains who were feeling the
singular inspiration of Australia. And the
paper found an audience for them. Al-
though the first-fruits, Farrell's How He
Died, appeared in book form in 1887, it
was not till 1895 that the book publisher
took up Australian work in earnest.
Paterson’s Man from Snowy River had
such a success that it was quickly fol-
lowed by the collected work of Lawson,
Dyson, Boake, Ogilvie, Daley, Adams a,nd
Brady. In the last five years of the
nineteenth century Australian literature
leapt into being.
The prose writers had not been idle ;
but their work was
1e s s remarkable.
Rolf Boldrewood
had put, the bush-
ranging period into
fiction once and for
all; Ada Cambridge
wrote domestic tales
with an Australian
setting and an Eng-
lish sentiment;
Louis Becke pic-
tured brown girls
on thewhite beaches
of the South Seas
very alluringly;
“Steele Rudd”
bubbled over with
the native humor
of selection life ;
and Dorrington
carved some bush
cameos with a strong,
and cynical pen.
Most of the work
is objective. The
bush bards owed
somethingto Kipling
for form, but they wrote of the things they
knew about : rudely at times, always
vigorously. The horse gallops as freely
as in Gordon’s pages. The men and
women of the bush are given with almost
photographic realism ; but in Daley’s
verse there is a delicate note of fancy
which is independent-of time and place.
The century closed with a little book of
genuine poetry from dreamy Roderic
Quinn. *
Most of the group which burst into
book-form in the ’9o’s are still writing.
But the force of the horse and swagman
school is spent, and the best verse of the
twentieth century is more subjective in
character. The local color is less obvious
and the workmanship is finer. In Louise
Mack’s Dreams in Flower , which leads
the way, there is the unmistakable lyric
cry; and Jessie Mackay has recently
given her best and Maoriland’s best
in purely lyrical utterance. From Maori-
land also came Church’s Th.e West Wind,
The After-Gl-ow of David Ross, and a book
of lyrics by Dora Wilcox : —cultured and
attractive work, which just misses being
memorable. Hebblethwaite and Brereton
supply a spiritual element of rare beauty,
and Mary Gilmore has sung cheerily of
love and hope. Frank Morton, in mastery
of all forms of light verse, would be notice-
able anywhere. Rupert Atkinson, though
VICTOR J. DALEY.
[“ Wine and Roses," a selection from the best of
Daley's verse printed since “At Dawn and Dusk,” will
be published shortly .]
not seeing clearly through the philosophic
mirk, “ .By the Midnight Sea,” has landed
some curious shells and seaweed. He
should find some things of rare beauty
when the clouds roll by. Miss Baughan
with her Browningesque treatment of the
mysteries of existence in Shingle Short
displayed insight and technical skill of
high order.
Hugh McCra'e, who has published only
in a limited edition, struck a still higher
note of imagination; and Bayldon’s strong
color sense filled a few poems with bar-
baric splendor. The most remarkable
work of the period is that of Bernard
O’Dowd. At first the reader by
sheer force and directness. Harsh and
ugly at times, it looked as if the writer
were trying to become the Bobbie Burns
of the psychopath, the phagocyte and
the colloid. But the passionate desire to
smash an effete civilisation has been
checked by an invasion of mystic sprites,
with a result in verse of greater weight
and beauty.
There are others; but those mentioned
are the bright exemplars of the new
Australian poetry which has gained in
depth while losing in popular appeal.
They are not wdthout recognition; but it
is nothing like the phenomenal popu-
larity of Paterson, Lawson and Ogilvie.
The prose of the last 10 years, is
greater in bulk and quality than that of
any preceding period. My Brilliant
Career, by Miles. Franklin; Louise Mack’s
Children of the Sun; Randolph Bedford’s
two vigorous novels ; the over-strenuous
work of G. B. Lancaster; the extravagant
humor of Dyson’s ‘ Fact’ry ’Ands —are
thoroughly Australian in character.
Clegg’s novels are equally faithful in
atmosphere, if milder in tone. Arthur
Adams’ Godaliad Jones is notable in point
of style and for its blend of fantasy and
realism. In Mrs.
Gunn’s We of the
Never-Never, a phase
of life peculiar to
North Australia is
for the first time
vividly and charm-
ingly portrayed. The
short stqries of J.
A. Barry and W. G.
Henderson, and
many others not
yet collected, are
often of fine artis-
try, ahd are usually
the true reflections
of our current life.
The recent con-
tributions to Aus-
tralian history have
been marked by
greater accuracy
than heretofore; but
we are still waiting
for a Green or a
Froude. Professor
Henderson furn-
ished a fine bi-
ography of Grey, and Lang’s Romance of
Australia has concentrated some of the
romance captured piecemeal by other
writers.
Altogether, Australian literature, now
fully launched on its own, is forging
ahead. There is no lack of writers, and
there is an audience, large in proportion
to the total population, which returns for
honest and vital work a warm appreci-
ation and a long memory.
HOME.
Some go out with the wandering birds,
Looking for home in homeless places,
Some go following flocks and herds
Over a world of friendless faces.
I’ll stick here on a forty-foot selection,
Growing new potatoes and a cabbage or
two ;
For it’s home, sweet home with the girl of
my affection,
Home with a dinner and a fire and you !

“ The world is his oyster."
HAW A-IKE.
From Hawa-iki they came,
The strong brown race of warriors,
•The deep-bosomed women, with far-dreaming
eyes.
The sturdy ariki children, questioning nothing,
To the land of the long white mist,
Over the gleaming sea.
Golden fruit hung low on every bough
In Hawa-iki,
There the fish crept up, and up, and up
O’er the whiteness of the coral beaches,
And the large birds flew low down,
Brushing with their wings the warrior’s feather;
Never was there need of net dr snare
In Hawa-iki,
Every f'oeman loved the whirring axe-head
.In Hawa-iki;
Never was there need of dance or haka
There to stir the warrior blood to frenzy ;
Never fear of traitor-stroke of coward
In Hawa-iki;
Men with love of life and pulses burning
Turned not ashen at'the falling death-mist
In Hawa-iki.
There were golden thoughts at dusk
In Hawa-iki; 1
All night long a music ebbed and flowed
In Hawa-iki,
There beneath the palms, by glowing beaches,
There by crystal stream and long lagoon,
All the women loved as ne’er again,
In Hawa-iki.
Aotearoa in the dawning,
Bathed in dew, arises from the darkness,
Koromako voices ring in chorus,
While the singing wave and stream make answer ;
Here the women’s arms are soft and clinging,
And the strong ariki children question nothing,
And the fish are very many for the netting, •
And the wings are all a-flutter in the forest,
And the shquting foeman loves the clang of
battle—
But, oh, for Hawa-iki !

adopt the Wunderlich system of treating Ceilings
and Walls. From an artistic point of view the Wun-
derlich Manufactures have effected a revolution in
Home Decoration. They neither crack, discolor nor
harbor dirt or germs; can be easily washed whenever
desired, and repay their initial cost many, times over
on account of their lasting durability.
WUNDERLICH ART METAL CEILINGS
ARE MADE IN AUSTRALIA
from Highest Grade Sheet Steel. They will cost but very little more in
Cottage you are building; they are easy to fix in any Home, Office or Public
by ordinary builders’ workmen; and, being composed of Steel, they lessen the

QUEENSLAND, the great North-Eastern State of the Australian Commonwealth,
is an enormous territory, containing 429,120,000 acres of land, scarcely four
per cent, of which has yet been alienated, and possessing many varieties of
soil and climate. The resources of its soils, pasturage, minerals and
timbers _ are well-nigh inexhaustible, whilst for beauty and wealth of natural
scenery it has no peer throughout the length and breadth of Australasia.

for sheep and cattle rearing may be obtained under lease for terms of 14, 21 or 28

SUGAR-CANE, NEAR BUNDABERG, SOUTH QUEENSLAND.
LAND SETTLEMENT,
IN no other country can the prospective settler find easier conditions or more
State assistance. Land of the class such as in the States of New South Wales
and Victoria and in the Dominion of Maoriland brings from to and
even up to per acre, can be obtained in Queensland at prices ranging from
£ 2 to per acre. For the purposes of Crown Land selection the country avail-
able might be divided into the two main Divisions of Agricultural Selections and
Grazing Selections. Under the former mode, land suitable for wheat-growing,
dairying, mixed and general farming, including sugar-cane and fruit cultivation, may
Depending upon the new selector’s intentions or previous pursuits, the country
may be classified as follows : —For sheep-breeding—the Southern (removed from the
coast), South-Western, Central and Central-North Districts of the State ; for cattle-
rearing—the same districts as for sheep, but to a greater extent in the Central-North
and Northern Districts (Gulf country) ; for wheat-growing—Southern Queensland,
including the Darling Downs and Maranoa districts,; and extending to the Mitchell
District in Central Queensland; for dairying —Southern Queensland and coastal
areas extending to the Cairns Hinterland in the North ; for sugar-cane growing—all
along the coastal districts, extending from Mossman, near Port Douglas in the North,
right down to Tweed Heads on the New South Wales border in the South.

of natural scenery, and in
the temperate summer cli-
mate of her great tablelands,
such as the Darling Downs
and the Cairns Hinterland—
which form the great sanatoria
of the South and North
respectively—Queensland
stands unrivalled. Through-
out the length of the Queens-

where the ceaseless Pacific

North Queensland, and many
others. To those seeking an

culminating with a run over
the Cairns Railway to Kur-

Herberton, Yungaburra or Chillagoe, the scenery along which no pen picture can
adequately describe, the Queensland trip should be to the rest of Australia what the
Mediterranean is to the rest of Europe. The round trip from Melbourne to Cairn?
and back can be done in 27 days (return fare, 10s. first class) ; Sydney to

RAILWAYS.
HERE are now close on
4000 miles of Queens-
land Government Rail-
ways open for traffic, while
about another 300 miles is
in course of construction.
No other State can boast of
such a comprehensive railway
system. It consists of four
main lines running westwards
from the ports of Brisbane,
Rockhampton, Townsville
and Cairns, thus obviating the
necessity of centralising in
one main port, where con-
gestion of traffic would natu-
rally occur.
The route of a proposed
Tran scon tin en tal Railway,
which will connect the
Western termini of the
Southern, Central and North-
ern lines, has already been
examined.
The latest line opened was
the extension from Atherton
to Herberton, and a further
extension to the Evelyn
Scrub, opening up a large,
fertile tract of farming and
also rich mineral country,
will be completed .shortly.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiik Bum.ktin’ ivould. oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
in vite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bum.ktin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there ; the official
ahvays is.

OUR COLORED BROTHER.
A FEW weeks ago, when Australia happened to
be too busy over politics to pay much heed, the
voice of a certain bishop might have been heard
crying in the wilderness about Australia’s treat-
ment of its aboriginal population. On this sub-
ject he of the gaiters spoke with severity,
declaring that the things which had happened to
Black Brother were calculated to bring down the
wrath of God on this country’s head. And it is
just possible that that bishop was right, though
it is more than possible that he wasn’t. Cer-
tainly many bad things have happened to Black
Brother in Australia, though a lot of the
stories are vague, and a lot are legendary,
and a lot more are subjects of dispute.
Most of the white people who are sup-
posed to have done these things are dead now,
Most of them, too, were not Australians at all,
but imported British settlers of the first genera-
tion. The people who are now engaged in the
active demolition of Black Brother are mostly the
Chinese, Malays and Asiatic sundries of the
North, upon whom some of our bishops look with
a kindly eye ; and the Australian white man of
to-day is making some lagging efforts to retain
the remnant of Binghi on the face of the earth.
The results seem to show that Binghi was
doomed in any case—that he represents one of
those futile races which can’t look civilisation in
the face and live. The Church mourns his
departure—sometimes with tears and sometimes,
as shown above, with threats of Divine wrath—
as an unmixed calamity. More worldly people
have doubts about the calamity, and about the
Divine wrath, and consider that the attitude of the
white race in this matter calls for reconsideration.
Nowadays, it is apparently the great desire of
the white man to see the world filled with the
largest possible amount of nigger. When he finds
the frequent nigger who is prepared to multiply
greatly under white supervision, he is very glad ;
when he finds the rare or sparse or unusual nigger,
like our Binghi, who insists on withering away
despite all efforts to save him, he expresses deep
sorrow, and is often denounced by his bishop for
not being sorry enough. The bulk of the people
may not feel that way, or may not know , that
they feel that way ; but they, or their rulers,
act that way. They may do it from inferior
motives, but the thing is done all the same. In
old Africa, for instance, the nigger, left to himself
amid the garish loveliness of nature, with the wild
elephant and the driver ant for company, got
work at keeping his own numbers within limits so
that he wouldn’t so increase as to be a serious
menace to his neighbors. By human sacrifices,
slavery and local wars, he judiciously thinned him-
self out. Sometimes closer settlement was averted
by the wiping out of whole tribes ; the Dervish
Government almost cleaned out a nation, and when
the original Boers trekked into what is now
the Transvaal, they found hardly anything
save ashes, bones and the footmarks of Zulu
armies. But nowadays, over most of Africa,
white men toil strenuously to keep the peace
and prevent one nigger even looking crosswise
at another, and year by year they get closer to
the ideal state in which every Ethiopian will sit
beneath his vine and fig-tree, and never scrag his
brother (to the disadvantage of the birth-rate) any
more, but save his gun for a shot at his white
boss. Similarly, in Asia, the Mahratta, the Pin-
daree, the Dacoit and the Tartar looter 'maintain
some sort of order ; and even the Afghan has to
keep the peace to a certain extent; and, when the
Boxer wants to box, it is the white man’s ambition
to prevent him. Thus soldiering begins to take
the place of disorderly border scrimmaging. Then
the same white man is for ever going about with
a drain-pipe held in his strong but simple grasp,
and trying to clean up the Black, the Brown and
the Piebald. At Panama he considers that the
shamblesome half-caste will now increase enor-
mously owing to the practical abolition of yellow
fever. By wiping out the sleeping sickness on the
African highlands he reckons on saving hundreds of
thousands of niggers, who will thus live to be the
fathers and mothers of millions of little niggers,
who will grow up and marry in their turn, and be
the parents of tens of millions of small niggers.
The Dutch in Java and elsewhere, the French in
Algeria and Tunis, the Yankees in the Philip-
pines, and other nations in other places are hard
at work scraping, scrubbing, cleaning, draining,
disinfecting, inspecting, registering, supervising
and medicating niggers, also cutting their hair and
advising about their clothes. The worldly white
man does this on business principles, because he
doesn’t want to catch diseases himself, but it
leads to an awful multiplication of nigger. As
for the unworldly white man—the gaitered and
shovel-hatted variety—he carries the thing to
excess. If he comes across the most hopeless
kind of Black Brother anywhere—the sort who, if
he were dry-nursed for 10,000 years, would still
take the short road back to the tree-top the in-
stant his white mentor’s eye was off him —his one
ambition is to cultivate that hopeless nigger, and
have so many of him that there will be one in
each tree, and no room will be left for the more
progressive white races. And his language when
the scheme doesn’t come off is terrible and full of
reproach.
* * * *
In some places amazing success has attended
the white man’s efforts. The first census of Java,
taken in 1815, gave the population as 4,615,000,
which was no specially great result of nigger
self-government, seeing that it was the accu-
mulation of all the ages since Genesis. Yet
90 years later (in 1905) the census showed a popu-
lation of over 30,000,000, and the present figure
is estimated at 34,000,000. This stupendous and
incredible result of clean, careful and fatherly
Dutch administration is making Holland wonder
where things will stop. Celebes is the same size
as Java, and has very much the same climate and
the same fertility ; yet, under mostly nigger con-
trol, its population is only estimated at half a
million. The difference represents the white
man’s success at raising potential enemies as com-
pared with the black man’s comparative non-
success at raising himself. In India, between
1891 and 1901, the provinces which are under
direct British rule increased in population by
10,695,875, while those that are under native
princes decreased by 4,178,420, which is
another evidence of the white man’s capa-
city for making Black Brother multiply, and
Black Brother’s failure to multiply on his own.
The black man in Cape Colony is supposed to
have about doubled in numbers in 20 years, which
he certainly didn’t do when he ran the country
himself else the Dutch would have found him
piled four storeys high. And grave hopes are
entertained that when the census of all Africa
is available it may show equally staggering
consequences.
* * * *
Side by side with this great effort on the white
man’s part to numerically increase his Black,
Brown and Yellow Brother goes his effort to
teach that person the white man’s literature so
that he may acquire new ideas of equality, and to
show him the mechanism of the white man’s
gun so that he may learn to assert that equality,
or even something more. The other day it was
mentioned quite casually that the new Chinese
army constructed on European lines and armed
with the best European weapons was growing
fast, and looking remarkably well; that 5834
miles of railway were under construction in
China; and that the first Chinese Legislature (of
a sort) had met. That was a fair amount of in-
formation for one week. Over a big section of
the world the white man is toiling to raise an
artificial nigger who doesn’t know how to raise him-
self, or is teaching a nigger to raise himself where
he never before possessed sense enough to do it.
The white man, in fact, is cultivating a sort of
armed rabbit —a multitudinous individual who
may yet crowd him off the face of the planet for
his pains. The more numerous this artificial
nigger becomes the more hostile, as a rule, he
grows. Sometimes he is a perfectly mild Black
Brother whose hostility doesn’t matter, but most
often it does matter. Europe is a very small
land, and, in a comparative sense, densely
peopled. Asia and Africa are large and very
empty, but the European is insanely proud of the
fact that, under his fostering care, they are filling
up rapidly ; also, that both of them shoot much
better than they did, and are improving every
day. He even alleges with satisfaction at times
—as in the case of the new Chinese army —that
they shoot as well as he does himself. Some-
times his own dead body is found lying around to
prove it. Yet withal, even the maddest philan-
thropist who ever carried knowledge to the
heathen has an uneasy idea that the
veneer of civilisation which he is imposing
so industriously on his Black Brother will drop
off again when there is no longer a white superior
at hand to hold it on. The man who came down
from the treetop to learn the knowledge of Europe
will probably go up again to his arboreal home
when the restraint is withdrawn, and the person
who came out of the cave with a piece of raw
meat in his hand will go back there. The danger
is that the veneer may not be sufficiently perish-
able. It may last long enough to let the owner
do irreparable mischief, and the murky brother
who left the tree in Nigeria may take to it again
amid the ruins of London, after breaking an
article (to wit, the white man’s civilisation) that
can never be replaced. This time he may stay in
his tree, the person who unwisely beguiled him
out of his previous tree being dead.

A race which professes to have an active belief
in the theory that the best possible world is the
one with most niggers and other backward races
in it are the clergy. (Politicians, as a rule, don’t
believe; they just drift.) The clerical theory is
that there can be no Colored Danger provided the
tinted races acquire the Christian religion, and
that they are acquiring it, or will do so if enough
threepennies are put in the plate. It is a com-
forting view, but there are grave doubts as to
whether the colored person is getting the Chris-
tian religion one-tenth as fast as he is getting
the Christian gun. Moreover, it is doubtful if
the religion will stick if he does get it, and
it is doubtful if it will make any difference sup-
posing it does stick. All the teachings of history
go to show that the Church is just as good as its
period and its surroundings, and no better. If
the people improve, the Church does the same ; if
the people deteriorate, the Church does likewise.
It may be a saint or a Holy Inquisition or a can-
nibal, according to circumstances, and still
be a Church. The clergy, in fact, have
no light worth speaking of to throw upon
the vexed question of our Murky Brother.
That person, when left to himself, has,
during recent centuries, been a fairly harmless
circumstance, partly because his pike was out of
date, and partly because his small birth-rate or
his very large death-rate prevented any formidable
increase in his numbers. A thousand or 1400
years ago he was a dangerous and horrid savage—
a holy terror treading Europe under foot ; 100 years
ago, when a Tartar contingent fought against
Naboleon I. in Germany, his bow and arrow
were a mere jest. But somehow this decayed-
looking person is often capable of a stupendous
renaissance when a strong, sanitary white man
goes to him with authority in one hand and a
drain-pipe in the other. Not only has he usually
increased in a marvellous fashion where the
European has taken him in hand, but he has
acquired, or is acquiring, a new confidence.
Moreover, he is getting back to the place he occu-
pied in Attila’s time as a soldier who is armed
equally with his much scarcer European brother
—and for that the fool white man is responsible.
Whether the white man has overdone the busi-
ness or not remains to be seen, but there are signs
in India, China, Japan and South Africa that he
has. What course, exactly, he should have taken
it is not easy to define, but a course which puts
34,000,000 niggers where 100 years ago there
were but 4,000,000 looks like one which
this crowded little earth can’t stand very long
without something breaking. Therefore, it is im-
possible to sympathise wholly with the infuriated
clerics who lament because our own Binghi
didn’t multiply into millions instead of fading
away. His case is one of the world’s tragedies,
but his usefulness was limited, and his possibilities
were apparently nil, and on a globe that isn’t
made of india-rubber somebody must make room.
A FORGOTTEN CORNER OF NEW SOUTH
WALES.
A few weeks ago it was announced with pride
that the population of Sydney has swarmed up to
well over 600,000, and that the city now contains
about 37 y 2 per cent, of the population of the
State —a degree of congestion never before
attained. It was also mentioned that to all
appearance the congestion is still increasing. The
election held last October revealed that the city
and suburban electorates are now absurdly large in
comparison with the country ones, Middle Har-
bor, for instance, having 16,333 electors, as com-
pared with Darling’s 5052. In consequence of this
a re-arrangement is inevitable, and a much larger
proportion of the 90 Assembly members will have
to be allotted to Sydney and its environs, and a
much smaller share of the membership to the
regions that lie far out. That will mean, if past
experience is any criterion, that there will be so
many more votes for dragging everything to
Sydney, and so many less for giving the balance
of the State a fair show ; and, as a consequence,
congestion will be pushed along and aggravated
till another and yet another re-distribution of seats
are called for. In fact, barring Federal inter-
ference or revolution, it is possible to foresee a
time when about one-twentieth part of N.S.W.
will return 89 members to the Assembly, and
the other nineteen-twentieths of it will re-
turn one member or thereabouts. Possibly,
before then, the Commonwealth will seize with
a firm hand on the railways and on the
whole job of railway construction, and will
start to build lines regardless of State capitals
and State boundaries. Or else the great general
subdivision of Australia into new States will
happen. Otherwise, there seems to be nothing to
stop the march of the great Congestion policy.
Looking with a dispassionate eye on the map
of N.S.W. one may notice by accident the coun-
ties of Tara and Wentworth. They are not
wholly different from some other counties, but
they serve to show what N.S.W. loses by
the policy which declares that every part
of the State is accursed unless it is so situated that
it can trade with Sydney. Tara and Wentworth
form the extreme south-western corner of the
State. They have a rainfall of 12m. per annum,
or thereabouts, which isn’t much, though there
are lower records in Australia ; but they have
compensating advantages. They both lie on the
Murray, at a place where the Murray is a big
reliable stream ; and Wentworth county is also
traversed by the Darling. Thus they have the
best facilities for inland navigation and for irriga-
tion that Australia can supply. The soil is fertile ;
by way of evidence, just across the Murray, in
Victoria, lies the splendidly prosperous fruit-grow-
ing settlement of Mildura, with a notable past and
a great future. And by land, as the crow flies, the
county of Tara is only 150 miles, and Wentworth
about 190, from a fine port and the third-biggest
city in Australasia. These distances aren’t much,
as distances go in Australia ; they represent about
the mileage of Forbes in a straight line from
Sydney, without anything like so serious a moun-
tain barrier in between to hamper railway traffic,
and with the great added advantage of river navi-
gation as a sort of side-show. Then these two
corner counties are wfithin 300 miles of the second
biggest city in Australia (with a good port
attached), and within 300 miles of a third port
which can accommodate n,ooo-ton vessels with-
out turning a hair. They have other possible sea-
outlets besides. Also a railway touches their
border, but isn’t allowed to come any
further. Looking at the geographical con-
ditions, and taking no account of parochial
jealousies and meannesses, one would naturally
say that this south-western corner of N.S.W.
would be a very considerable centre of popula-
tion and a big source of revenue. If there were
no State boundaries and State prejudices it would
seem that N. S. W. would have a dense streak of
coastal population trading with the outside world
through Sydney, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Coff’s
Harbor, Brisbane, Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay ;
and an almost equally dense streak along its
southern and south-western border with outlets
by the Darling and Murray ; also by Melbourne,
Portland, Adelaide, and the little harbors on
Spencer’s Gulf and the Gulf of St. Vincent. And
the two south-western counties, traversed by two
big rivers, handy to a railway (if they were
allowed to connect with it), and with eight
harbors within a reasonable distance, should be
the centre of this border population.
Unfortunately, all the harbors within possible
distance of this promising region—Melbourne,
Portland, Adelaide, Port Wakefield, Port Pirie
and the rest —are in other States. And the rail-
way which comes to N. S.W.’s door hereabouts,
yet isn’t allowed to enter, is a Victorian railway
connecting with Melbourne. And the rivers flow
into another State. Apart from the strip of low-
land along the eastern coast, this far corner might
be about the most hopeful section of N.S.W., but
its trade can’t by any possibility go to Sydney ;
so it is the most neglected fragment of
the State. Tara has nine people to 100
square miles, and its population is dimin-
ishing. Wentworth has one person to three
square miles, and its population is also diminish-
ing. The two counties are a wilderness and are
becoming a desert. Yet the rivers are always
there, and the railway terminus and the prosper-
ous town of Mildura are visible any day across the
Murray. The district is almost a coastal one as
Australian distances go—almost near enough to
the sea for surf-bathing. It is a place which can
find fresh fish daily, and can raise a drowning
accident in the middle of the old man
drought. But because it is far away from
Port Jackson, Parochialism holds it accursed. It
lies where three States join, and it can’t use the
chief harbor of its own State because it is too far
off, while the harbors that it could use are for-
bidden because they aren’t in its own State.
New South Wales is a palace, but the owner has
got in the habit of dwelling in one corner of it
and going in and out by the front gate ; and he
burns the other three corners and part of the
middle, being angry at them because he doesn’t
live in them and because they are nearer to the
back gate.
When the British Government devised its “ Ter-
ritorial Army” it was, admittedly, making a sort
of final effort to prove that a voluntary defence
force was a possible institution. With a sinking
heart it spoke large, bounceable words to
the effect that Britons never would sink to
‘ ‘ conscription ” as practised by wretched continen-
tal nations which ate horseflesh and couldn’t be
trusted near a cab-rank lest they should consume
the animals on the spot and possibly bite
the vehicles also. The Territorials were fixed
at 300,000 men, not because that was sup-
posed to be enough, but because the most san-
guine patriot didn’t hope for more. The
most sanguine patriot was right. Stupendous
and incredible efforts passionate speeches,
special appeals in the press, sermons, the
production of patriotic dramas, huge pro-
cessions, and strong compulsion on the part of
some large employers who gave their able-bodied
minions the choice of military service or the sack
—nearly filled the ranks once, but only once.
Now the bottom and sides have fallen out of
the scheme and the lid is missing. The first
of their Territorials have completed their term
of service and are dropping " out. Also
a few are dead. New men are not
coming forward to fill their places. The
glamor is faded. The processions have gone
home. The patriotic drama has run its course
and been succeeded by “The Girl from Fluffs.”
Even the patriotic employer is tired, and instead
of sacking his employee if he doesn’t join the
Territorials, he sacks him if he does, on the
ground that military service interferes with busi-
ness. In fact, it is all over.

The house-fly myriads crowd each window-

A Holiday in Sydney.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
WHEN I was in the Maoriland Railway
Service, the management severely dis-
couraged the idea of holiday trips to
Sydney. A careful secretary had noticed that
once an officer spent a holiday in Sydney he never
rested till he got back there. In the service, as
elsewhere throughout Maoriland, Sydney was re-
garded as an alluring Babylon—a place of gilded
sin, where no woman wore more than enhanced her
beauty, and where ■ money was easily made and
went far on account of the cheapness of things.
Rutaniwha section was thrown into a state of
suppressed excitement by the whispered informa-
tion that Morgan and Jenkins had actually visited
the dreadful place, and could talk of nothing else.
Even the Old Man heard of it, and he sent for
them together, and questioned them closely as to
the progress of railway management and book-
keeping in New South Wales. Also, he wanted
full particulars of the signalling apparatus. Morgan
and Jenkins had only seen a railway engine three
times during their stay in the city, and then from
afar off. At first they tried to bluff, but they
broke down hideously.
Then the Old Man divested himself of his
managership —hung it up with his long overcoat,
produced cigars and made inquiries about sundry
ladies he had been introduced to. He was de-
lighted to find that Morgan and Jenkins had met
some of them —behind certain bars. The con-
versation concluded with the pious hope that
Csesar in Wellington would hear nothing of the
escapade.
I was toiling at Maraetara, where the S. M. was
temporarily incapacitated through being kicked by
a racehorse while assisting to put the animal in
its box. There was a vile slander afloat to the
effect that he had been walloped by the groom in
charge of the horse for not paying up a bet, but
nobody took any notice of that. Jenkins arrived
on Saturday night to relieve me, and we spent
Sunday out among the giant pines and rimus
amidst a wilderness of wild convolvuli and
clematis.
Jenkins’s yarn knocked out two illusions—that
things were cheaper in Sydney, and that vice was
a gilded artistic thing there. But it fired my
desire for adventure. Deep down, lam afraid, I
was a larrikin at heart, and my soul grew hungry to
go to the City of the Harbor and paint the blessed
town all the shades from deep purple to crimson
lake.
On Sunday night squatter Howard arrived and
heard the tail end of the narrative. He seemed
disturbed and then moody.
When Jenkins was asleep Howard produced a
bottle of the then favorite brand and lit his pipe :
“These blokes make me tired with their blessed
tarradiddles about Sydney. But what vexes me
most is that they give Maoriland a bad name.
Bet your life these two skjters simply got into a
quiet pub at bedrock prices, and walked round
and ogled a few demireps for an hour or two
each night ; then got in before closing time and
made up crackers to unload on a credulous ser-
vice. Get a holiday, and we’ll take a run across
and do the thing properly, just to keep the blessed
country’s name up.”
This idea of going on a burst in Sydney for the
country’s sake impressed me. I am naturally
very patriotic.
* * ♦ *
We got our first glimpse of the Harbor about
3 p.m. one glorious Saturday afternoon. The
water was floored over with yachts and sailing
craft of every sort and description, and when we
came round Bradley’s Head and the splendor of
the first glimpse of the city smote our eyes, we
were struck dumb.
“ It’s Elysium, all right ! ” muttered Howard,
with his eyes glued on Potts Point and Elizabeth
Bay.
“What a filthy, stinking collection of dog-
kennels ! ” he gasped when me stepped ashore at
the foot of Margaret-street and gazed round the
desolate landscape.
We got into a cab and told Jehu, the off-
spring of Nimshi, to drive us to the best pub in
the place.
“ Be sure it’s the best,” said Howard. “ We’re
from Maoriland, and if we find you’ve driven us
to some second-rate den to earn a few bob com-
mission we’ll put a face on you that your own
wife won’t recognise for a month. We’re from
Maoriland.”
The cabman smiled grimly.
“ Price no object, eh ? ”
“ Certainly not —we’re from Maoriland.”
“That’s all right, boss; but most people as
comes from there goes to a cheap boarding-house,
and has their letters addressed to some swell
hotel, and calls round there twice a day to buy a
drink an’ put on dorg.”
“What did I tell you?” groaned Howard.
“ The damned wretches haven’t the slightest
regard for the country’s reputation.”
After half an hour of steady driving the cab
stopped.
“Here yo’ are, gents. I dunno if it’s ther
most expensive ; but it’s the place all ther squat-
ters stops at.”
We got out and, after the lugg-age had been
dumped down, inquired the fare.
“ I always leaves it to gentlemen themselves,”
he explained, with a leer. “ I only fixes me
charges when I drives bounders.”
“ Right. There’s a quid. We’re from Maori-
land.”
The cabman touched his hat as he scrambled
on board, and went away, no doubt, cursing him-
self for taking half an hour to drive us seven
minutes’ journey when we were so prodigal.
* * * *
“ I think we must be overdoing it, somehow,”
said Howard, drearily, next Saturday morning as
we stood among our belongings on the footpath
waiting for a cab. “ Fired out of three pubs in
one week seems a fairly broad hint, doesn’t it ?
“It does. What about taking a furnished
house for ourselves ?”
“Nothing in that —we could have a good time,
no doubt; but it wouldn’t advertise our country.
And that, I think, is what we are here for.”
“ Well, this is growing monotonous. My own
opinion is that this place is run by the Y. M.C. A.
or the W.C.T. U. I’ve seen ten times more life
in little Rutaniwha than we have struck here, so
far. The gag about money going further is a lie ;
and it seems more scarce than where we come
from.”
“ Yes, there’s something wrong. Where the
devil are we to go ? I don’t believe there’s
another decent pub in the whole bloated place.”
“ Let’s dump the luggage into the railway left-
luggage office, and get an agent to find us a place
while we go out to that pony race-meeting and
see if we can’t break a bookmaker or two.”
A VENUS THE WORLD WILL
NEVER SEE.
BROWN'S HOSEKEEPER (whom he has vainly
endeavored to convince that posing for pic-
tures is a respectable occupation): “Hex-
cuse ME, Mr. Brown! Hexcuse me ! I'd
like to see the feller as 'ud arst ME to pose
like that there ’ussy." (Collapse of Brown.)
Howard broke into a cheer. A man passing
by stopped, examined him carefully, and then
diving his hand into his coat-tail pocket drew
forth a tract, which he proffered.
Next moment he found himself engaged in a
heated theological discussion which raged for
half an hour while the cabman grinned on his
perch. Then the tract distributor retired in good
order, and we drove away to the railway station,
and then hunted up an agent to whom we ex-
plained our wants.
He chuckled, considered for a moment, and
then remarked :
“ Drive here from the races, and I’ll be waiting
for you. I’ll get you fixed up, never fail.”
It was a palatial private boarding establishment
at Potts Point, which, in those days, was still
covered with the seats of the mighty. The
agent informed us that it was an establishment
kept exclusively for young gentlemen with money
to burn, and we could do as we darned well liked
so long as we paid up each day for the damage
done the night before. The proprietress was a
youthful-looking lady with pale teeth and prema-
turely whitened hair.
She said she would introduce us to our neigh-
bor, Mr. John H. Garner. His suite consisted
of all the rest of the rooms on the top floor, and
they were models of artistic furnishing. His
“ sticks ” were his own, and save for a slight pre-
dominance of the Asiatic, were in excellent taste.
When I looked at John 11. himself, I understood.
He was tall, well set up, about 34 years of age,
dressed with scrupulous care and in the best taste.
His complexion was golden-tinted. A curious,
rich yellow seemed to lie beneath his skin and
glow through it. He was clean shaven, his lips
unusually red, his eye-lashes coarse and long, and
his well-groomed hair had a peculiar lank-
ness about it that defied brilliantine. His
eyes were almond-shaped, and the man’s whole
appearance shouted of a strain of Chinese blood.
He told us he lived at the top of the house for
the sake of the view and the fresh air.
We developed a great liking for John H.
Garner, and the only fly in our ointment was that
he could never be induced to come out and join in
our revels abroad. He stuck religiously to his
sky flat, and nothing could take him away from it.
How it'started I don’t know, but I will always
maintain that the man who should have got into
trouble over it was the manager of the pub where
we had the champagne. We were perfectly sober
when we went into his bar, and we had only
two magnums of champagne—not enough to make
a Christian Endeavorer drunk. But the next
thing I knew was that I was sitting on the top of
a hansom cab with my legs dangling. The cabman
was standing up in front cursing, entreating,
threatening, and trying to grab the reins. He
swore it wasn’t “the cheese” to drive down
King-street like that. And each time he grabbed
the reins a whip sang over my shoulder and made
him let go. I screwed my head round. Howard
was in the boot and lashing all round with the
strength of ten. The street seemed to be crowded ;
the sky was cracking with the uproar, and every-
body was rushing, swearing and clawing at some-
thing.
Then I suddenly realised that we were the
centre of attention. A gigantic Kerry policeman
sprang on to the cab, only to fall back with a red
weal across his face. A dozen hands seized the
horse’s head, my legs, the boot and anything else
that could be laid hold of. A fighter to the back-
bone, squatter Howard stood up and lashed away
magnificently. There was a bump as the reins
gave way and I crashed down into the street on
top of two cursing policemen. I tried to strangle
them as I fell, and then we rolled in the mud.
People trod on us ; others hit and kicked us. A
policeman got me by the ears and tried to screw
my head off. I bashed him in the face with my
elbow and hit him on the ear with both feet.
Then the sky burst in a myriad of flaming stars,
sparks, glowing cinders, unpaid bills, meteors,
devils, I O U’s and comets. The backcloth was
filled with a glare of lights, shadows and figures
that reeled to and fro. Then I was bumped down
on my back.
“ Mad as the Devil, both of ’em ! ” I heard a
voice say, as someone commenced to go through
my pockets. I tried to hit out again, but, find-
ing I couldn’t move my arms, let my legs loose.
They, too, seemed clogged. Anyhow, what did
it matter ? I turned over, and it seemed to me
that I lay on my other side and slept for 47 years.

“ Here, undo these cursed
straps and get me some coffee.

manded, trying to piece things
together.
“ Phwat happened? Sure

“ Coffee, is it, you’re want-
ing. Sure, there’s no tea-
room attached to this place,
but I’ll see the sargint. ”
When the sergeant came he
regarded me with a look of
wisdom. Then, turning to the policeman, he
said I might be unstrapped, as I appeared to
be in my right mind.
“ Pretty row you made last night,” he said,
sagely, turning to me. “ What went wrong with
you ? ”
“ I say, nobody’s dead, I hope ? ”
“ Well, no, not yet ; though there’s more than
one may peg out from shock. Half a doseii
THE MAN WITH
PAPER FANS.
FOR THE BULLETIN.
fnHERE came to my house , yestermorn,
■*- A man with paper fans ;
And I was filled with wrath and scorn
That such a man was ever born.
He waved his paper fans —
He waved them in his strong right hand
That could have burst an iron band;
And six feet high he seemed to stand.
Then said /, in my scorn and wrath :
“ Oh, man with paper fans,
Why standest thou upon my path,
Thou man as large as he of Gath,
And wavest paper fans ? ”
For he was big, and young, and strong,
And fit to take his place among
Those men who labor all day long.
But , though my voice with anger shook,
The man with paper fans
No slightest notice of me took,
As, with a calm, contented look,
He waved his paper fans.
For nothing of my scorn could reach
His brain. No lesson could I teach.
He said: “ The fans are threepence each."
Then , in mine anger fierce, I swore :
“ Oh, man with paper fans,
Hell's curse upon thee, sad and sore.
Go ! take thy presence from my door!
Thou and thy paper fans.
Is this a time with fans to play ?
God show thee holiest work to-day."
Slowly the giant moved away.

for being the victims of your awful liquor. We’re
from Maoriland.”
During our period of remand we became in-
terested in a case of “spieling.” The lawyer
who was manufacturing our alibi had something
to do with the case. A young bushman from
Maoriland had been accosted Dy a gentleman
who delivered tracts, and finally induced to buy,
for a share in the ground on which the
City of Sydney was erecting a structure after-
wards known as the Queen Victoria Markets.
We got interested, and at our request the
lawyer brought along our fellow-countryman for
inspection. A quiet-seeming man enough, of
about 32 years of age. Had worked on a back-
blocks station all his life, won most of his money
in a sweep, came to Sydney for a holiday, and
met a tract-distributor, who told him a bogus his-
tory of the site of the new markets, and finally
introduced him to the chief gentleman concerned.
He described this last person as being something
like a half-caste Chow, but for the fact that he
had red curly hair and was slangy in his language.
The yarn was that the owner of the property had
come into an immense fortune in England, and
having more wealth than he knew what to do'
with, had given his friends the chance of forming
a little company to buy the' Queen Victoria
Markets dirt cheap. As a special favor, because
the tract-distributor had introduced him and the
half-caste with the red hair had taken a sudden
liking to him, he had been allowed to purchase
50 shares for Fie was taken to a solicitor’s
office, where he signed the necessary papers.
It was a fortnight before he discovered that he
had been rooked. He called at the office of the
alleged solicitor to ask the whereabouts of his
friend, the promoter of the co. Finding the
office vacated, he inquired of the caretaker where
the Gent. One had gone, and the caretaker's
language was so violent that he began to have
doubts about his Further investigation
corroborated his worst fears ; and he was now
trying to track the robbers.
As he told us that the police were making no
progress, we took the victim home in order to
consult the brilliant Mr. Garner about the matter.
When we arrived I noted a seedy-looking man
tvatching the house in front. This so impressed
us that we went round to the back and inspected.
There also we found a seedy-looking man.
We left our defrauded fellow-countryman in
OUr apartments while we hunted up Garner.
That brilliant man of the world was at the
window, keeping a worried, surreptitious eye
upon the seedy watcher outside. He mani-
fested little interest in our story at first, but
when we got into the details of the narrative he
became feverishly excited. He paced up and
down the room and talked to himself, and cast
piercing glances at us from under his eyebrows.
Then at last he told us all.
It was a sad story. His brother, who pre-
sented a remarkable resemblance to him,
was a spieler, forger, trickster and con-
fidence man of the worst order. John
H. Garner had come a long way from
some place with an unpronounceable
name in order to reclaim him. Not
only had he failed, but he found him-
self practically a prisoner in his own
apartments; his resemblance to the
notorious relative made him an object
of such interest in the streets that out-
door life had become distasteful to him.
It was agreed that we should ex-
plain fully to the victim. Then we
were to bring him into Mr. Garner’s
room, and if he tried to rush at that
gentleman’s throat the moment he set
eyes upon him, it would be regarded
as fair and reasonable evidence that the
brother was the offender. In that case
Mr. Garner proposed to make good
the loss, and having done so he in-
tended to give up all efforts at the re-
clamation of the brother. In fact, he
had decided to pack up his belongings
and take ship back to the place with
the unpronounceable name whence he
came, and spend the rest of his days in
dignified retirement, decorated with art
and interspersed with good works.
Despite our explanations it took
Howard and me all we knew to keep
the bushman from leaping on Mr.
Garner and rending him, so remark-
able was the resemblance between him
and his disreputable relative. But he
apologised afterwards and accepted,
with deep thankfulness, the £soo
worth of notes which Garner pressed
upon him. He suggested that we
should all go forth and have a drink,
and we did so.
The jaw of the seedy man in front of the house
fairly dropped when Garner and the victim went
forth together arm-in-arm, and laughing joyously.
He wore the aspect of one who was up against a
phenomenon of no mean size. He looked, for a
moment, as if he were half-inclined to attack the
four of us. Then he thought better of it, and
dashed round to the back, possibly to arouse the
other seedy-looking man. Just then a solitary
cab came along in a swift business-like way, which
almost suggested that it was there by arrange-
ment. At Garner’s instance, we all crowded in.
Garner gave the address of a hotel down town,
and we departed at great speed, with the horse’s
tail streaming in the wind. Looking back I
just caught a glimpse of the two seedy-looking
men leaping round a corner, with fury writ large
on their faces.
“ Now you understand why I dislike going out
by daylight,” said John H. Garner, sadly.
Things moved rapidly after that —-so rapidly
that the rest of the story only occupied a quarter
of an hour.
John H. Garner insisted —absolutely insisted —
on shouting first.
When the bushman was just beginning to shout,
Garner asked to be excused for half a second.
He had to rush through the back door and buy a
penny stamp at a bookstall.
The barkeeper said that the bushman’s £lO
note was bad, and not even a decent imitation.
The bushman uttered a shriek of dismay, and
hauled out the whole fs°° wor th of notes.
Then he dashed them on the counter and sprang at
Howard, saying that he was a blanky accomplice.
Howard got him down and sat on him, and
called to me to rush out through the back door
and intercept Garner’s retreat.
I rushed for the back door, but three barmen
hung on to me and declared that I wouldn’t
escape in that fashion. Consequently, I made no
progress after Garner.
Then the seedy-looking men burst in, rein-
forced by others like unto themselves. They
seized me, they seized Howard, they seized
the bundle of bad notes; but they didn’t seize
John H. Garner, for he was gone.
“By thunder ! I’ll turn spieler myself when
we get out of this,” said Howard, with a terrible
curse, as we were bundled into a four-wheeler en
route for the police station.
But that curse was nothing to the one he
uttered next day when he heard the last of the
story. For, while we were being arrested, John
FI. Garner had sped back in a swift vehicle to the
boarding-house. There he had spent a strenuous
five minutes going through Howard’s belongings
—he wasted no time on mine—and the plunder
was worth close on ,£4OO. The seedy men, with
a belated premonition that he might double back
on his tracks, arrived just in time to hear that he
was once more gone.
This time he stayed gone.

MASHING A
MERMAID
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A SIMPLE sailor cast ashore
Upon the tropic isle of Torr,
All lonesome grown and desolate,
Strove long to win to be his mate
A Sweet mermaid from others strayed,
Who round a tiny inlet played.
Her skin zvas palest gold, her eyes
Were heaven deep and baby wise.
Her hair zvas greener than the sea.
“/ love you—love you!” pleaded he;
But she was shy when he came nigh,
And fled into the deep hard by.
In vain he wooed until the day
He came upon a box which lay
Among the wreckage. Searching that,
He found a most enchanting hat.
This, with a glass, upon the grass,
He planted to entice the lass.
And now a smiling deep-sea maid
In Merry Widow hat arrayed,
By her ozvn ravishments beguiled,
To Jack’s caress is reconciled.
Which pins as time the slighted view.
That mermaids are Eve’s daughters too.

THERE never was another girl, I think,
So finely fitted for each moment's uses
As you, my dear. What shall we have to
drink ?
Come! I’ll take no refusals or excuses.
It must be wine to-night ; because, you see,
To-night we’re out of touch with care and
sorrow.
To-night is gold, and you are kind to me ;
We’ll pledge in wine our possible to-morrow.
Then, should to-morrow come and find me lone,
I’ll have at least the memory of this drinking
To keep me glad. One joy I shall have known:
Our eyes have met and spoken, yours un-
shrinking !
They’re deep and excellent, you know, your eyes,
Tender and grave. Your mouth, too, ’s
wondrous winning.
To do the right thing still a fellow tries,
But if I kissed you it could scarce be sinning.
This wine’s aglow with kisses, and the sun
Of your clear presence warms a weary sinner:
What better solace when the day is done
Than just the girl to suit one—and the dinner ?
A hansom-cab’s a cosy car of bliss,
When those within it are so sweetly mated.
The god within the car is needed. His
It is to keep bliss pure, and joy unsated.
That is, I know, a trifle trite ; but I
Have inexpressive moments when sincerest. . . .
I love you most when you’re so proud and
shy. .. .
Ah, but I thought at last you would, dear . . .
dearest !
So we escape, for yet a little while,
From all the sordid crowd that would encage
us !
Dear, did you notice that old cabby’s smile ?
Delight like mine is just a shade contagious !
I like this room of yours. It stands above
The city’s noise and squalor, and its quiet
Comforts and soothes. I’m very much in love
With peace, and much abhor all sordid riot.
The scent of flowers upon your window-sill
Whispers of rural gardens prim and olden.
The growing wheat’s delicious, dear ; but still
Your hair is of a more entrancing golden.
No morning glows, dear, can outshine your eyes ;
But natural lights may show them more allur-
ing. . . .
The last tram’s gone. Lord ! how the glad time
flies !
But memory’s still amazingly enduring.
When I am old I shall recall to-night
(You never will be old ; but you’ll remember),
And I shall laugh aloud in Time’s despite ;
The thought of you will fan the fading ember.
And from the scattered ashes of my dreams
Your face will rise, with tears and rapture in it,
And I shall love you wholly ; though it seems
I could not love you better than this minute.
Here, while your cheek is warm against my cheek,
The very thought of age seems half disloyal
To you. You know', this week’s a purple week,
And I, your lover, stand aloof and royal
Above the crowded heads of meaner men,
Who pinch and steal and grind and beg and
borrow. . . .
That’s Two ! Ten minutes since ’twas half-past
ten,
And I w ; as darkly talking of to-morrow.
And now to-morrow’s come and is to-day—
To-night ! To-night! Ah, dear, your eyes
are splendid
In this soft glow—a golden soothed to grey,
Like the cool west, when all the sunset’s ended.
This trick of similes, comparisons,
Holds me, you know ; but you’ll forgive that,
knowing
How habit makes a slave of Adam’s sons
’Mid winter’s blasts or when spring’s wu’nds are
blowing.
For me, I only know I have you—ay,
Have you and hold you, utterly and sweetly.
It’s passing strange. What is your secret way,
Thus to bewitch one at a glance, completely ?
Sleep ? Yes ; but I shall know you very near :
The knowledge will emparadise my dreaming.
I am your sultan and your slave, old dear !
I anr —the rain is down your window streaming.
I, Lord ! I’m comfortable as can be ;
I’d not change places with the Tsar or Kaiser.
There’s Venus peeping through the cloud-rift. . .
see ?
Don’t hide your face so. We cannot surprise
her.
She’s watched a myriad loves, that lady there .. .
Tired out? Not she. You mean, am I tired?
Fairly.
But there’s no fellow happier anywhere,
Good-night ! We two shall greet the dawning
squarely.
There never was another girl, I think,
go—poor old kid ! How soundly she is sleeping,
And Venus, that white rascal, seems to wink;
And on soft feet Dame Hushaby comes creeping.

Beethoven Op. 27 No. 2.
HERE ill my wall-perched, old, East Mel-
bourne garden
There is a cypress—calm, serene, and
stately,
Slanding as sentinel upon the hill-top,
And steadfast looking to the Dandenongs.
And never does the red moon rise behind it
But I do think of summer by the Arno ;
The moonrise in my garden outside Florence ;
The second house in Via Michele Lando,
Near to the foot of Vale di Colli
There is the Roman gate ; from it the wall—
The good brown wall that Buonarotti builded
Straddles the little vale to Santa Gallo ;
Beethoven must have seen it all to write it,
A violet darkness prinked with stars and lilies ;
The tragic, terrible, glad, yearning music !
At the first gleam Rita began to play it,
And I was fey, and old times came again.
* * * *
Sword, flame and feather, all in beauteous one,
The serried cypress on the hills of lime
Bore steadfastly the last shafts of the sun—
Marking the race of Time.
The burgeoning night, like a great purple flower,
Came down to Bellosguardo, hastening
To take the tribute of that place and hour
To crown another spring.
The cypress —very tranquil and serene —-
The hot moon rising on the wooded hill
The violet night, thick-scented, dimly seen,
The mystery deepened still
The ululations of the nightingale ;
The firefly flamed his hour with flickering sign—
Momently blazing ere his life did fail
Beneath the stately pine.
Looped, as for some old Caesarian feast,
The cirrous vines bridged air from tree to tree ;
Corn, poppy, grape—the greatest and the least
Gave out their scent to me.
The ancient domes of Florence in that haze
Blurred, shimmered, wavered, died in silver
air ;
And then came nigh me men of ancient days,
And women very fair.
And through the trees, and to the rays unclear,
Came long-dead youths, and damsels hurrying;
Armed men with helm and falchion, mail and
spear;
And maidens in their spring
Past mouldering statue—marble balustrade —
Past roses,masking half the stone’s decay ;
They came unto the moonlight unafraid
Who’d lost the light of day.
Beauty of maiden —eye whose glance was truth —
Eyes that were of all love’s delights the sign ;
;Strong men who loved the sword and cup from
youth,
And lived by steel and wine.
Women ! One who so long ago did prove,
And now, sad-eyed and wet-cheeked, as with
rain,
That in all times, wherever is great love,
There ever is great pain.
.‘Some who had died because of selfishness ;
Some who had died by caring not for self ;
Many—of factions innocent—in stress
Of Ghibelline and Guelph.
.Satyr to nymph no more adown the glade
Grinned his goat’s grin— nor made lascivious
dance ;
Imperfect man and perfect artist made
The dawning of Romance.
:Steeped deep in beauty, and absorbed in art,
The people of my dreams, and their old town,
Did sudden rise and arm and cry and start !
For savage foes came down !
'The savages of Germany and Spain
Did burn their arts and beat their dreams to
dust!
The fearful tocsin drowned the lovers’ strain,
Art died in blood and lust.
Hera and Aphrodite ! Phoebus ! Pan !
Fauns and the nymphs’ white loveliness of flesh ;
The beauty-sense that makes a god of man
The savage did enmesh.
Goddess and nymph did disappear from earth,
Dead youths became but shadows of the trees ;
The music, dying at the wind’s re-birth,
An echo in the breeze,
Dead maids and men thinned out to nothingness ;
The violet night was luminous and clear ;
Only the softness of the wind’s caress
Kept sense of beauty here.
The music ended —gone the man and maid !
Gone the high captains of that dream review !
But, in the half gloom of the woody glade
Beauty was born anew.
Here, in my wall-perched, old, East Melbourne
garden
There is a cypress very calm and stately,
And I do think of summer by the Arno ;
Beethoven must have seen it all to write it,
And in his music it came back to me.

We Three.
A MISSIVE came from Lawson; a postscript
writ by Quinn,
Which reached me in Australia, the land
we’re living in,
And this perplexing problem was jointly asked
within
That schoolboy screed of Lawson, that spider
scrawl of Quinn :
“ We’ve all been brewing verses of patriotic bree
In this our native country, for eighteen years and
three,
To-day we searched our pockets, and coppers
merely three
We found in our possession of wealth and pro-
pertee.
“ Some head you have for business—a current
myth mayhap—
But can you, of your knowledge a line of reason
map,
Why we should get the deadwood and never
strike the sap
How does your metre canter, and how are you,
old chap ? ”
I seized an ancient cheque-book, and on its
virgin note,
Inspired by fellow feeling, some answer thus I
wrote :
“ If you had been a jockey who wore a spangled
coat,
If Quinn had been a jobber and kept cronk stock
afloat ;
“ If /had been a seller of either rum or tea,
I might have more than sixpence to swell your
coppers three,
We might have choicer vintage than plebeian beer
to spree,
Plus three stakes in the country, and furnished
villas three.
“Three motors might use petrol, wear Sunday
hats and silk ;
Be pillars, not examples—the trick I dare not
bilk —
If meat instead of metre, or maize, long odds, or
milk
We three lean bards had dealt in—like others of
that ilk.
“ Or if our Muse, correctly, had sung societee,
The golden worth and glory of our Rumocracy ;
And crawled to Vested Int’rests, I’d be a fat
M.P.,
And you, Sir Henry Lawson, and Quinn,
K.C.M.G.
“ The subject’s almost sacred, lhe outlook seems
more dark.
Our boyhood hopes are ashes, our youthful dreams
lie stark —
Three coppers and a sixpence ! —I dare not jest
or lark ;
We sang the golden wattle who should have
stripped the bark!
“ Ten pounds a ton ’tis bringing, and stripping's
gentler toil
Than grinding out these verses or burning mid-
night oil
On sketches all Australian —why further slave and
moil
With sones of ‘local color’ and stories ‘of the
soil ? ’
“ Herewith the proposition : This game of Poesy
Is greatly over-rated ; in witness, take we three.
Let Quinn to selling produce—not starlight in the
sea ;
You straightway murder Mitchell, and I will
choke McFee !
“ To something sane and useful therewith well
straight repair,
Re-sole the people’s hlucliers, or cut the people's
hair ;
Turn pugs or peel potatoes, seek fortune other-
where
Than wooing haggard muses. And who the deuce
will care ? ”

Rue Barree.
BEYOND a sleepy township a
lost road turns to seek
A ford that no one uses across
a drowsy creek ;
Above, old slip-rails moulder, too frail to
bar the way,
Where fading letters falter the warning, “ Rue
Barrie.”
The track is but a shadow—a greener shade on
green ;
The brambles pluck in protest, lest any pass
between ;
Yet once that path was open to portals of
romance —
The gateway of a garden whose blooms were
brought from France.
The rose curled lips of crimson where now a tangle
grows
From out the rank profusion of seeds that no man
sows ;
O’er all the ordered garden wild weeds have
spread apace,
As if, to hide bereavement, the earth w'ould veil
its face.
A dial still is standing, its gnomon stained and
green,
Its motto, hid by mosses, a truth no longer seen ;
A sweet but hopeless precept —“ Ne cotnpte que
Ctieure heureuse "’;
One such at least it numbered —’twas there I
kissed J oyeuse !
I cross the ragged pleasaunce, where, pacing to
and fro,
Joyeuse and I together in dreams were wont to
go ;
I mount the old stone stairway between the
marble urns—-
But none comes forth to welcome the roamer who
returns.
Beneath the balustrading brown lizards make
their home ;
At twilight in the garden the raiding ring-tails
come ;
The underbrush gives refuge, for here none ever
slew
The wdld things seeking safety Irom aught that
might pursue.
I gain the lonely orchard where bees in summer
drone ;
I tread the rathe red clover, full-hearted and
alone.
Though rust is on their hinges, the windows still
are clear ;
There’s sunlight in each chamber, as when Joy-
euse was here.
F'rom shine to shadow lingers the long, long
afternoon ;
All life is lapped in silence —and yet I hear a
tune
As if a child were singing to children sure to find,
By shyly peeping backward, the fairies dose
behind.
Joyeuse, although so briefly your life to me was
lent,
You gave, nor knew you gave it, one gift that
brings content :
I have not wholly lost you, for our dream-
children play
The games of living childhood in the grounds of
A 'ue Barrie!

Where you alone were swimming, Dear ;

And loving billows wrapped you, Dear;

My love had no subduing, Dear ;

Beside that beach had hovered, Dear;

Young Eros I discovered, Dear!

Tappa.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
WHEN Time’s defacing finger
Has marred the nut-brown maid,
And lads no longer linger
Near Tuna, slow and staid ;
As, ever growing fatter,
She sees, beyond repair,
Romance’s idol shatter
And melt to thinnest air,
She need not mope all lonely,
Left out of Life's hubbub,
A clique of “ Ladies Only,”
The “ Old Girls’ Tappa Club,”
Not merely won’t blackball her,
If quick of tongue and hand ;
But will be glad to call her
Within its busy band.
There she may find a corner,
And spend her future days,
A worker for, but scorner
Of, Man and all his ways.
When all our grapes are souring,
Through growing out of reach,
We turn from their devouring
To criticise and preach.
And here it may be slated —
Though now well known enough—
That what is indicated
By tappa is a stuff
From mulberry trees ploven
(Those of the paper kind)
And turned to cloth (not woven)
By work of womenkind.
Who take bark-strips, and soak them,
And scrape their skins ; and then
They roll them up, and poke them
In water once again.
Then they arrange them lying
Across some timber beams,
And, wooden mallets plying,
Knock out the tappa seams.
Next, ’tis the ladies’ function,
Their privilege and trade,
To paste these in conjunction
Till yard on yard is made
Cohesive to the size that
Exigencies decree ;
A portion for a prize mat,
Or fathoms more, maybe.
The South Sea natives’ wrapping
When living, and when dead.
His coverlet when napping,
A shroud for his last bed.
A cover for his flooring,
His saddle for a ride ;
Accretive wealth, for storing,
A present for his bride.
But when the crones assemble
Around each bark-strewn log,
All reputations tremble
As active elbows jog.
The star of Mrs. Grundy
Shall greatly glow and w'ax,
Oh, ’ware to all and sundry
When woman tappa whacks !
Tap , tap! each hammer goeth,
From morn till dewy eve;
And to the sound there floweth —
To state the fact I grieve—
A spate of words relating
The gossip of the time,
A stream of slander slating
The victims of its slime.
Tap! “ Have you heard that Mary
Has got a little lamb ? ”
“ Oh, wasn’t she unwary ! ”
Tap , tap , tap , tap , bang, slam!
“ Bah ! the excuse is hollow !
He” — tap , tap , tap , galore—
I think it wise to follow
The symphony no more.
Thus, when years pile in number
Upon the coaly crown
Of woman w'ho is umber
(A synonym for brown),
When dancing brings a tightness
Within her spreading chest,
And life has lost the lightness
Of youth’s illusioned zest,
She 'finds a compensation ;
Not she superfluous lags.
The censors of the nation,
The conclaved hz/yto-hags,
1 ler person soon environ ;
And she, too, self consoles
By driving home the iron
To other people’s souls.
It’s bitter, nasty badness
Of course ; who cannot know
The anger and the sadness
That such proceedings sow ?
But, let me meekly mention,
They’re Polynesian, quite,
And no such hen-convention
Exists where folks are white.

The Rival Identities.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE Nar Nar Magpie claimed to be a
powerful organ, and a director of public
opinion. It was edited by Henry J.
Cuddy. Henry had a very large bald head. His
body was small and lean, and his eyesight so poor
that he was compelled to read and write with the
assistance of a big burning glass with a wooden
handle. The office of the Magpie was a draughty
den, furnished with a rheumatic, broken-jointed
table and an inverted oil-keg, and stuccoed over
with colored posters. Out on the roof of the
establishment perched a tin magpie.
One bright spring day the editor of the Nar Nar
Magpie sat on the inverted oil-drum, within easy
access of a tumbler of something hot. For the
third time he pensively perused his latest editorial
on the superior qualities of Swede turnips
as a fodder for milch cows. He had reached
the crowning glory of the composition when
the sound of distant profanity, and the
rattle of a kerosene-tin being kicked
through a window, diverted his attention.
Presently the door of the sanctum was
burst open, and a little, smoke-dried old
man dashed into the room, all perspira-
tion and excitement. He clutched the
latest issue of the Magpie, and was
cumbered with a walking-stick like a
Maori’s war-club.
“What do you mean, sir? What do
you mean?” gasped the diminutive in-
truder, in a shrill, reedy voice, upsetting
the editor’s rum and menacing him with
the sapling. Henry J. Cuddy executed a
strategical retreat into a corner and
warded the besieger off with the oil-keg.
“ There, there, calm yourself, sir.
You’ll be all right presently,” said the
editor soothingly. “Your poem is in
type —it is, sir, : pon my honor 1 We will
print it next week.”
“ I ask you what you mean, sir ? What
do you mean by this?” reiterated the
visitor with increased excitement, tapping
the paper.
“ Ah, then, you wrote that article on
* Footrot —Its Cause and Cure.’ A
splendid thing. It will appear in our
next issue. I give you the solemn
assurance of a man of letters it will go
into our next issue. Perhaps we failed
to notice your five-footed calf. Maybe
we overlooked your sample of patent
manure, or misspelt your name, or in-
serted your wife’s funeral notice under
the heading of ‘ Situations Vacant.’ It
will be rectified in Wednesday’s Magpie
—it will, indeed, sir.”
“ Poem, footrot, calf, funeral notice,
be , sir ! ” yelled the old man,
, j 1
purple with emotion. “ Listen to this, you—
you—mopoke ! ” Peering closely into the paper,
and punctuating his utterance with energetic beats
of the cudgel, the visitor read aloud the following
apparently innocent par :
The many friends of our esteemed townsman, Mr.
Abraham Brown, will hear with pleasure that, although
he has passed his Both year, he retains the vigor and in-
telligence of a man of 40. Mr. Brown is by far the oldest
inhabitant of Nar Nar ; he arrived in the district when the
country on which this flourishing town now stands was
nothing but a wilderness, and can distinctly remember
the first wooden store which occupied the spot on which
our magnificent Town Hall is built. Mr. Brown is hale
and hearty, eats well, walks 10 or 12 miles every day, and
can read the finest print without the assistance of glasses
of any sort. He has always identified himself with the
interests of Nar Nar, and his anecdotes of its earlv
struggles are most interesting. We wish our oldest
identity every happiness.
“ Now ! ” gasped the aged visitor with factitious
calmness, “ what do you mean by that ? ”
The editor was about to explain that he meant
nothing in particular, and that he would be happy
to apologise for it in the next number, when the
old man’s feelings once more overcame him.
“That’s all a lie, sir—and Brown’s a liar, and
I’ll have him up for perjury—by Heaven I will—
perjury and defamation of character, and fraudu-
lent pretences ! Brown the oldest inhabitant !
Look you here, I was clearing scrub on Nar Nar
before Brown was born ! Why, he’s a mere boy
yet, sir—a mere boy ! I’m old enough to be his
father —quite ! Our oldest identity, eh ? He’s a
kid—a kid, I tell you ! Nothing but a kid, and I
nursed him. Oldest identity. Bah ! Lies ! Lies !
My son will lick you into fits for that, sir ! I’ve
a mind to hit you in the ear myself! ” And the
fiery old wreck dropped his stick, and assumed a
pugilistic posture; but, worn out and weakened
by the fierceness of his wrath, he tottered and
fell under the table, panting and exhausted.
As a result of the interview, Wednesday’s Mag-
pie came out with a long and flowery article
explaining that “ our worthy and widely-respected
townsman, Mr. Emanuel Magill, had very kindly
called upon the Magpie, and, in the course of a
pleasant and instructive conversation, had directed
its attention to several inaccuracies in the previous
issue.” Then followed a biography of Mr.
Emanuel Magill, beginning with the time when
he first pitched his tent on the spot now occupied
by the Post Office, and winding up with a solemn
declaration that said E. Magill was the oldest
inhabitant and identity of Nar Nar, and a heated
assurance that all other oldest inhabitants, past,
present or future, were frauds and impostors, and
unworthy of the friendship of honest men.
The consequences were disastrous. That after-
noon the family of Abraham Brown, headed by
Abraham in person, waited upon Editor Cuddy to
ascertain what he meant and why he meant it,
and used up enough profanity to make a team of
working bullocks canter from Perth to Botany
Bay. They alsp kicked holes in the table with
their working boots. The master-mind of the
Magpie succeeded in escaping into the loft, from
which windy height he begged to assure the meet-
ing on his oath as an author and a gentleman that
Saturday’s issue (the Magpie was a bi-weekly)
would contain a full and complete apology, and a
vindication of the claims of Old Brown, likewise a
poem about his career. After which the Brown
family, at the earnest invitation of H. J. Cuddy,
took a drop of something short and retired in
triumph.
This state of affairs agitated Editor Cuddy
to the depths of his being. He had received
charge of the Magpie on promising the pro-
prietor that he would engineer the paper to suit
all tastes and please all parties, from the High
Church Bible Class to the Nar Nar Card Club ;
and now, in the third week of his reign, he had
accumulated a complication which was like to
squander aspersions on his tact and ability, and
lay him open to assault as well. The situation
was painful, but in an adroitly-worded article—a
masterpiece of vacillation—the gifted journalist
performed a retreat, and planted the Magpie
and himself on neutral ground. The article im-
plied that each of the contending identities was
older than the other. It also insinuated that each
had camped on the site of the Town Hall some
years before the other. It was a diplomatic dis-
quisition—almost an inspiration —and Cuddy was
wont to point to it in after years as an evidence of
his ability to conduct a paper on variety lines.
By this time all Nar Nar and the surrounding
district had awakened to the grave importance of
the oldest inhabitant question, and a score more
candidates made their debut, each with indisputable
evidence of his prior right to the title.. But the
PLENTY CF TIME.
1ST DROVER (five weeks on road): “Hullo, mate ; any good water about here?"
STATION-HAND : “ Yes, there's a good dam about two miles along."
DROVER (to his male): “ That's good, boss; we'll be able to have a wash to-night."
OLD BATTLER : “ Dunno, Jim, if if s worth while — we'll be home in a fortnight!"
great majority of the people were of opinion that
the contest lay between Daddy Brown and
Emanuel Magill. Party-feeling ran high, and the
Magpie was inundated with letters bearing on
the claims of these two gentlemen—their physique,
pedestrian powers, longevity, digestion, eyesight,
and other items of moment.
But in the course of a week, a daughter of the
patriarchal Magill presented her husband with
triplets. This was a crusher for Brown. No such
incident had ever transpired in his family. He
felt that it would weaken his cause. Magill was
now two grandchildren ahead of him. He was
furious; and, whilst Magill and his friends revelled
over the lucky increase, he called a meeting of his
married sons and daughters, and in round terms,
not unmixed with profanity, accused them of con-
spiring to repress his posterity, and bury his name
in oblivion. His youngest daughter, who had
only produced five children in eight years, whereas
each of her sisters had increased by seven, he
reprimanded with all the eloquence and fire of a
disappointed but indulgent parent. Stumping the
room in a whirlwind of just indignation—thinking
of the friends who had seceded and backslid from
his cause, arguing that the grandparent of triplets
had most reason to be regarded as the oldest
identity—he denounced that daughter.
“ Five children, ma'am!” he piped, his
shrivelled frame trembling with emotion. “Five
children in eight years —a big young woman like
you ! Your mother had nine in that time —nine
as fine youngsters as ever was ! You won’t get a
penny from me, me lady, mind that, not a penny !
You don’t consider my feelings, and I’ll dis-
inherit ye ! ”
The daughter was much affected, but her parent
was firm and continued in a state of great ferocity
for two days and three nights. Then an event
happened which relieved the strain on his feelings,
and he smiled again. Old Magill was discovered
to be bald. For years he had hidden this dis-
grace under a wig, but at length his sin had found
him out. Rising in response to a call to make a
few observations bearing on his phenomenal staying-
powers and excellent condition—it was at a public
meeting, convened to discuss the new Land Act —
he had grown so garrulous that a darkly-brooding
Brownite had time to note things. This Brownite
was a person of suspicious mind, and he had been
considering Magill from behind. Suddenly he
leaped on him from the rear, plucked the wig from
his cranium, and brandished it aloft, calling for
cheers for Brown. The effect was magical.
Yells, boo-hoos and derisive laughter issued from
the congregation. The disgraced identity stunned
the Brownite in his tracks by assaulting him on
the head with a great stick, and the meeting broke
up in the wildest disorder.
Magill was forthwith relegated to a back seat,
from which point of vantage he could watch his
rival monopolise the honors that accrue to the
resident of greatest antiquity. He said bitterly
that he would walk to Brown’s funeral yet, “even
if it Was 60 miles.”
The struggle between Magill and Brown was
sustained for many months, and as the popular
identities became feebler and more broken (they
were both about 84) their protestations of un-
mitigated health and strength grew more vigor-
ous. Magill by superior lying gradually elevated
himself to Brown’s eminence once again, and
Brown blew out his last remaining tooth, which
caused his stock to slump in the market. Magill
must eventually have drawn ahead of his
rival ; but, being a man of hasty impulses and
overweening ambition, he thirsted to assume his
rightful position on the instant. That was how
he came to assault and partly slay Brown in
church.
The two oldest inhabitants were attending
divine worship at the same place, simply because
it was the farthest from their homes and the best
advertisement of their walking powers (neither felt
equal to striking out for the neighboring village,
10 miles off). Service was in progress. The
deep, solemn tones of the officiating parson filled
the sacred edifice. A dim, religious light filtered
through the stained windows. The congre-
gation was hushed in sleep. Each of the
oldest identities (they never missed an oppor-
tunity of advertising their ability to read
small print) had a very small pocket-Bible
opened before him, -and as the parson dwelt
lengthily on an impressive passage, Brown, with
a gnarled index finger, pretended to follow the
lines. Stung by this glaring pretence, Magill
suddenly arose, and striding over to where his
rival sat, he flourished one of those formidable
crooked sticks which cripples are fond of wearing,
and with it dashed the Bible from the hands of
Brown. The clergyman stopped in the middle of
a word. The congregation, electrified into wake-
fulness, started up. Then in the hearing of all
present Magill fulminated his memorable charge.
Trembling with indignation, he pointed the finger
of scorn at Abraham Brown, and piped in a shrill
treble :
“ Fraud ! Rascal ! ! Impostor !! ! You can't
read small print.! ’’
Appalled at the magnitude of the accusation,
Brown fell upon his antagonist, and there in
that sacred edifice the oldest inhabitants of
Nar Nar fought a spirited round. The conflict
was brief, but when the hoary ruins were
torn asunder and held up, each felt that he
had accomplished a satisfactory amount of
damage. Frothing, coughing and spluttering,
they were led away by sympathisers, and the ser-
mon moved on. But the congregation had little
attention to spare for pious admonitions. An
accusation had been hurled against an oldest in-
habitant of Nar Nar which must rankle in the soul
of every man who had the interests of the tow ; n at
heart, and that accusation must be proved, or
withdrawn with all humility. Alas ! before
church was out the accusation had been proven,
and all Nar Nar knew’ the worst. Pressed by his
best friends, Brown reluctantly confessed that, far
from. being able to read the finest print, he
couldn’t read at all, his early education having
been entirely neglected. Commenting on this
painful disclosure, a correspondent to the Mag-
pie, himself an old man, caustically observed that
no person who could not read small print
with ease could, under any circumstances, reason-
ably hope to be regarded as an oldest identity.
The reading of small print had been the first
qualification of oldest identities from time imme-
morial. If Nar Nar acknow'ledged Mr. Brown
as an oldest identity after what had transpired,
she must expect to impair her status in the eyes of
neighboring tow-ns, and seriously injure her trade
with London, Paris and other centres.
So Brown was hurled from his high estate.
But he did not abandon hope. He still main-
tained his right to the position of oldest inhabitant.
Pie still travelled a distance to church, and feebly
expatiated on the size and weight of his appetite.
In his extremity he even announced his intention
of journeying to the next towm for spiritual solace
in future. For some time Magill deliberated
within himself as to whether he would compro-
mise his dignity by pitting himself against a man
who could not read fine print, but he finally
decided that he needed more pedestrian exercise,
and he resolved not to be outdone by Brown.
On the following Sunday, at a very early hour,
the two heroes were seen tottering out of Nar
Nar, leaning heavily on their sticks. At tea-time
they had not returned. A party was organised
and it went out to make inquiries. About six
miles from the town Old Brown was discovered
with the dust of a ten days’ journey clinging to
him, shuffling along; A few hundred yards
further on they came' up with Magill, who was
also crawling painfull)' towards that distant
church. The fact that ’ Magill was ahead assured
his position as oldest inhabitant. The relics were
hoisted into a wood dray and carted back to Nar
Nar. Both were prostrated, and within a week
Brown had passed to the bourn from which no
Methuselah returns. His death was hastened by
three plates of boiled beef and greens, which
he ate to satisfy the public that his appetite
and digestion were still unimpaired. His
last words, feebly gasped into the ear of a relative,
were:
“Oldest inhabitant of Nar Nar, remember!
Oldest inhabitant, aged 115! Carve it on my
tombstone. Oldest inhabitant, aged 150 —died
in the full possession of his senses, sound of
digestion. R. I. P. ! ”
Magill was still in bed when the news
of his rival’s death reached him. There
seemed little prospect of his ever rising
again, and Nar Nar was casting its eye
about with a view of securing another
brace of competent oldest identities. But
what was the surprise of everybody con-
cerned to see Emanuel, on the day of the
funeral, hobble out of his house and join
the procession, plodding slowly and
painfully behind the last spring-cart. The
funeral was pulled up, and Emanuel’s
relatives, who had left him in bed, urged
him to ride, hut he would not hearken to
them. He insisted upon walking, and
even flew a passion, and enlivened
the proceedings with some choice bullock-
driving profanity. In the end he was
allowed his own way, and the procession
moved slowly on. By almost super-
human efforts the relic contrived to keep
within view of the vehicles. When the
cemetery was reached other people stood
bare-headed, wearing a semblance of
settled melancholy as befitted so sad an
occasion; hut he grinned starkly, chuckled
loudly and rubbed his withered hands in
a weirdly hilarious mood. When the grave
was filled he jocularly patted the earth
down with a shovel, and croaked :
“ Ah, it’s sad to see ’em die so young !
Poor boy ! These colonials haven’t the
stamina of the old stock. Fancy one of
them walking to a funeral at my age—
they couldn’t do it, not one of ’em ! Two
hundred next birthday, an’ sound as a
bell, faculties unimpaired, eyesight good.
He, he, he ! I—l believe I’ll marry
again—l do ! ” And then he collapsed
and went to the ground in a heap. His
friends propped him up, but he was dead.
Thus ended the careers of two oldest inhabitants
who were not according to the rule, and the like
of whom has never been placed before an Aus-
tralian public before. There are people who state
that Magill and Brown were not legitimate oldest
identities, but that they had combined to murder
the rightful aspirant to the honor and hide his body
in order to usurp his place and privileges. This,
however, is mere idle rumor, and the stated facts
remain.

HE was utterly a stranger to me ;
He wore a beer-leaf upon his brow, and
his hat over one ear.
The day was hot, indeed, but the bar was some-
what cpol ;
I was hot myself, and suffered from thirst,
And I had not conversed with a fellow-thirster for
some time.
Hence, I passed the time of day with the beer-
leaved one,
Having previously said “ Morn’ ! ” to the pub-
lican—although it was afternoon.
The stranger’s reply was plain and to the point:
“ Mine’s a beer !” he said.
I had travelled a lojpg way that day ;
It was yet high afternoon, and the sun’s hot hand
had touched the earth to some purpose ;
The bar was fairly cool, however, and quiet—
except for the flies.
The flies sang steadily in the rafters—ribald,
beastly songs of meat and such.
I was hot as the Dead Sea and had a thirst ;
All publicans looked good to me that day, and
this one, a fat, cheerful soul, wore a grin
And pulled beer as though he liked it—the beer,
that is.
So, being in a melting mood, I was kind to the
publican.
“ Have one yourself! ” I said.
Three drinks stood upon the bar in a flash ;
Then, the gums rustling outside and the flies
roaring within, the beer passed on.
It was still hot, and so was I ; and I still suffered
from thirst.
I looked at the beer-leaved stranger, and fingered
my change.
Of course, I was a fool, since I understood that
that particular kind of stranger never did
anything but drink beer—
It says so in all the humorous stories.
Still, you never can tell, you know ; it is only
the unexpected which happens.
The stranger, shaking his beer-leaf into position,
played a noble part ; I was never more sur-
prised in my life than when—
“ Have one with me !” he said.

The Deceiver of Quandong.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
BY set of sun the glass reluctantly drops from
ioo° odd to the 90’s, and in the storeroom
of “ McNab, General Merchant,” the
pent-up provisions which had all day been giving
off subtle vapors become quiescent. Canned
goods cease to hiss, and the perspiration dries upon
the brow of the bacon. Still certain ancient and
fish-like odors wander through the crevices of the
wall which divides the storeroom from the bed-
room of the merchant’s lady employees—to wit,
Miss Dunn, milliner, and Miss Ryly, dressmaker.
In this bedroom these ladies are busy with their
own concerns.
“ Howd’s it look—chic?” asks Miss Ryly, the
dressmaker.
“ It looks like a second-hand widow trying to
be gay,” spitefully answers the limp figure on
the couch.
“ It ” is a satin bodice which is doing its best
to contain Miss Ryly’s exuberance. It is an old
garment, wearing a look of care. Shorn of its
shabbiest portions, it is being transformed into an
evening dress, destined for the annual ball, and is
patiently adjusting itself to its new r6le.
“Oh, it won’t be so bad —by gaslight,”
answers Miss Ryly, confidentially, “ when its
trimmed with Mrs. Dougall’s soutache braid.”
“What,” screams the milliner, “you’re not
using old McNab’s customers’ trimmings surely ! ”
“ No, only borrowing it, just for one evening !
With Mrs. Dougall’s soutache braid, and a note
of scarlet introduced on the corsage, I think I’ll
do. Such a good advt. for McNab’s, too, when
the report says ‘ Miss Ryly was regal in black and
flame ! ’ Or shall it be a costume of ‘ chiffon dia-
mente ’ ? There’s Miss Rafferty’s spangled gauze
—that would do ; my silk could be draped in it,
and —yes ” (her fertile brain evolving another
triumph), “ the report would call it chiffon dia-
mente —and Parma violets. Be better than the
other, don’t you think —more chic?”
“ Pish ! ” sneers the critic on the couch. “ Miss
Rafferty’s spangles would be known anywhere.
She may be at the ball herself, though Pleaven
knows who’d take her. And Parma violets !
Where, pray, are you getting Parma violets in
this dead hole ? ” she inquires slapping viciously
at the mosquitoes.
“ A superfluous question, Miss Dunn. I’ll get
Parma violets from you. Those old mother
Parsons chose for her bonnet will do ! ”
“What?” again screams her listener, stiffen-
ing under such effrontery. “What? you sup-
pose I’ll allow my customers’ goods to be mauled
about by a lot of louts. Why, you must be
MAD ! !”
“Now, don’t get excited, my dear,” advises
the dressmaker. “ It’s much too hot. And why
shouldn’t I wear the violets ? Mrs. Parsons is
half blind. She will never know their first bloom
is rubbed off, and, unless you split to McNab,
who’ll be the wiser ? ”
An egg blows up in the next room. The mil-
liner kicks the door ajar venomously. As it
swings out insects rush in, attracted by the light.
In vain the girls flap vigorously with towel ends.
The buzzing myriads are mightier than they. A
moment, and a score have suicided in the lamp.
Beetles as big as walnuts are crawling over the
dressmaking appliances spread upon the table.
Black, brittle creatures with scarlet spots, looking
like uncanny forecasts of Miss Ryly’s “ black and

flame ” hop about with metallic clickings of their
wings. Leggy jim-jam things of tender green
sprint round in the circle of light thrown by the
lamp, or, spreading their gauzy wings, settle on
Miss Ryly’s bare arms. Screaming, she shoos them
off with her towel. Then, banded together, the
two ladies swish and flap the larger insects out;
but not till the lamp is carried forth and left out-
side for a space does the room become habitable
again.
The light is regained by strategy, one of the
ladies frenziedly beating the air free of insects
while the other gets in with it. Then the door is
banged with a loud crash, and they breathe again,
“ It’s too cruel,” whimpers the milliner, pick-
ing portions of a beetle from her hair. “ These

beastly things give me the nightmare. It’s like
having delirium tremens without any of the fun—•
ugh ! there goes another down my back. Oh no,
it’s only a hairpin.”
After a space devoted to putting away the
bodice and puffing her tousled hair with intent to
charm the ‘ ‘ boy ’’ whom she has to meet at
eight, Miss Ryly commiserates her companion’s
ill-luck in having “no'ope ” of footing it at the
ball. “ Now that’s the worst of walking out with
one of the force. You never know the time duty
will call ’em from your side. You should keep
some other Johnnie in tow. It don’t do to put
all your eggs in one basket. ”
And Miss Ryly vanishes into the December
night.
“ Cat ! ” whines Miss Dunn. “ Off to meet her
grocery boy. Some people have all the luck.
No looks either, no refinement in that bouncing
type. Now lam distangay. And her conceit,
good heavens ! ”
Through the kitchen wall which flanks the bed-
room on one side comes the droning of the junior
McNabs at “home work,” interlarded with their
yelps under the rod of correction.
The milliner squirms upon her couch.
“Can’t stand this much longer,” she moans.
“ These beastly kids—and Mother McNab, and
the bacon smells. No chance of the ball either.
It’s cruel of Sergeant Rafferty to put Din on duty
that night. Done it to spite me—old fox—
because that ugly daughter of his wants Din her-
self. As if he would look at her—she’s got a face
like a herring—she’s a dog in the. manger—
she’s”
Hitting a tender corn on Miss Ryly’s cast-off
shoe at this juncture, and being at war with all
the world, she kicks the footware far and wide.
“Her and her chiffon diamente—bah, she
makes me sick ! ”
Then she languidly unhooks her hair. It is
scarcely in its cardboard box when the clip-clop
of hooves causes it to be skewered on again.
Quickly her eyebrows take on arches from a magic
pencil, her lips gather lustre from a magic bottle.
Shortly after, in answer to a faint cooee, she
too, in the sacred cause of love, braves the insect
terrors of the night.
Trooper Denis McDermott awaits her at the
verandah gate. Trooper Me. in the saddle is as
a demigod. Dismounted from his pawing steed
he is still a good-looking sweetheart—a trifle raw
and red with the weather, perhaps, and, if truth
be told, more than a trifle bandy.
Mere bagatelles these ; and the blissful period
in his company is to the milliner the silver lining
to the cloud.
Encircled slackly in his arm, she gazes upon
his features, ennobled by the moonlight into per-
fection, and thinks with condescension of Miss
Ryly’s grocer of homely build.
Of the ball McDermott holds out but little
hope. By the brutal decree of Sergeant Rafferty
he goeth forth to Black Range after Chinese
stealers of chickens, what time the dance will be
at its merriest. Thus he tells his tale. To any
but love-blinded eyes his manner may be a thought
distrait, not to say bored ; yet McDermott reveals
jealousy, metaphorically showing his teeth when
his love hints of finding other escort dancewards.
Her appearance at the festivity he sternly forbids,
and, rejoicing in his masterfulness, she again hangs
upon his arm and gladly promises obedience,
Not till a spectral hand (McNab’s), hanging
upon an adjacent nail the early milk jug, ob-
trudeth itself does she tear herself from his side
and regain the haunted bedroom.
Miss Ryly is even later, and she comes in bab-
bling of moonlight effects “down the creek.”
Descending to prose, she tells of a rise in her
grocer's wage.
“Any day now,” she brags happily from be-
hind her mosquito mask of hat-wire and gauze,
“old McNab may have to give me a wedding
gift.”

with here and there a wood dray, is drawn up
along Main-street, of which McNab’s is the corner

The carts are empty. The horses dive into
nosebags or doze standing. Their owners are
mostly in the auction-rooms opposite where their
butter, fowls and the everlasting fruit of the hen
are being sold.
At McNab’s drapery counter the milliner is busy
with customers. She is working off old stock,
There is a box, bottomless as the sea, of tree-

pent, is lost in the mists of time ; but, unlike these,
the aigrettes are more than household words in
Quandong—they are loathly facts. The skele-
tons of them may be seen in the bonnets of bush
grandams, or, new and freshly planted, shaking
aggressively in the solid hats of their middle-aged
daughters. As the iron rule of McNab is that at


least one shall be sold to every hat, even the head
gear of youth is not exempt, and concealed in tulle
or lurking craftily behind a rosette, the box of
aigrettes has ever its representative.
But few customers defy the milliner’s polite
coercion. Those only who can pay in com dare
“buck” on the aigrette. For poor wights who
purchase drapery with egg-currency there is no
escape.
Shop-laid buckles also. To get rid of these
special inducements are held out in the shape of
two crockery coupons to each, whilst the newest
buckles are sold on their merits alone.
Market day drags on. Hope in the milliner’s
breast is hard to kill, and still she looks for her
swain’s reprieve. A forlorn hope.
When, day having darkened into night, she wit-
nesses a dress rehearsal of Miss Ryly in the
“black and flame” (the Parma violets having
been spitefully refused), she is filled with bitter-
ness.
To-morrow being Sports Day all Quandong
will sweat and blister in the eye of the sun, while
cyclists scorch round the Oval. Then, having
washed off the layers of dust, the populace will
repair to the Sports Ball and pound heavily
through its 24 dances. All save she, that is.
Again Miss Ryly reproves her for putting all
her eggs in one “ barsket.” “ Always safe to
have a couple of boys,” she says. “One can always
be an understudy to the other, and then if one
fails you —why, there you are.”
Sports Day dawns. In the closed-up store of
McNab the atmosphere may be cut. Conforming
with the holiday movement in front, his back
door adopts a very different policy. All day
strings of customers, headed by the proprietor and
a flickering candle, like tourists in the catacombs,
thread the kerosene tins and onion bins, and,
emerging at last burdened with provisions, they
depart stealthily by way of the duck yard. Even
to the eleventh hour does the milliner hope for her
McDermott’s appearance. Then she is forced to
take the sad alternative the offer of a seat in the
trap of Mr. Gabble, shepherd of souls, en route
for a distant sheep-farm.
Seated between the Gabble couple she looks
round furtively. She believes McDermott to be
afar off, riding the distant ranges ; yet she would
make doubly sure that his eye should not light on
her. For ashamed is she of the saintly equip-
page. Yea, and of the steed that draweth it, for
fair game is it in the eyes of the constabulary.
The horse is at length persuaded to start.
Ambling over ruts and carpets of dead leaves,
enveloped in dust and followed by flies, the shep-
herd, unaware that his jaundiced guest compares
him facially with McNab’s billygoat, bleats with
self-satisfaction.
“True piety is shown —hug-h’m—I may say,
nobly shown —hum —by my wife, who visits with
the backslider —huh-hum —as on this occasion.
And may I ask—huh —my dear Miss Dunn, if
you are at peace ”
A mighty jolt causes the shepherd to bounce
above the heads of his companions, disclosing in
the ascent a V-shaped patch on his trousers.
Descending, the seat-back receives him harshly,
and he squeaks with pain. The milliner gags
him with a peppermint, and his bleatings are
heard no more. Miles of bush fencing bring
them to a sun-burnt house, with such a rush of
barking dogs that had not their owner intervened
the shepherd would soon have needed a patch on
his body as well as on his pants.
The hostess has apparently been milking, and
wears, in addition to bluchers, a man’s “ billy-
cock ” and a pair of moleskins under an abbrevi-
ated skirt. The necessity for this costume she
explains to be due to the late rains having con-
verted the cow yard into a “squodge.” The
visitors wait in the spotless parlor till she “ cleans
herself.” Upon the table, enclosed in glass, are
the hostess’ wedding favors, crowned with what,
on closer inspection, proves to be one of McNab’s
aigrettes.
“No escape,” mutters Miss Dunn in recoil.
“ When I’m an angel I’ll find ’em in my crown.”
On the wall, Daniel, in a draughty opera cloak,
converses with affable lions. This artistic effort
is of interest to the parson, as is the texture of the
tablecloth to his wife. She fingers it judicially.
Miss Dunn takes a silent vow never to go on
the land, and then the hostess returns.
Though still under 30, her face resembles
newly-varnished red-gum. Burning-off operations
have claimed her eye-lashes, and what she lacks
in teeth she more than atones for in wrinkles.
But her cupboard is full, and her welcome is
warm, in view of which her visitors cheerfully put
up with her other imperfections. A husband and
some “ hands,” after much splashing at the tank,
come in to tea. Plainly worried by the visitors
and hampered by the serviettes they, sooner than
decency permits, excuse themselves and fly to the
call of the cow. Little the shepherd cares for
their “ sloping.” Lavish in praise of the smoked
mutton and pickles, he sweeps the board. Mean-
while his wife, besides doing good trencher work,
collects cooking recipes, and compliments the
hostess on the color of her napery.
During the meal a scrubby boy turns up,
bearing pig-feed. The repleted shepherd cross-
examines this lamb :
“ Hum, what is your position here, my boy ? ”
“ Boarded out, sir.”
“H’m. A ward of the State, I suppose you
mean.”
“ Dunno, sir,” answers the lamb.
“ Hum. Have you ever—hum—realised your-
self to be also a ward of—hum—One above, my
child ? ”
“ Dunno, sir.”
“Do you ever fall on your —hum —knees?”
HE QUITE AGREED.
SWAGGIE : “ Will you please give me somethin' to cat, lady?"
MRS. COCKIE: “ Oh, I ain't got nothin' for yer. An' don't ‘ lady' me—I'm a plain woman,
I am! ”
SWAGGIE (enthusiastically): “ Y'are indeed, ma'am—jest about the plainest ever I see!"
“No, sir. Get er belting if I falls on enny-
thing, sir.”
“ Hum. You do not quite catch my meaning.
But —hum—we will let it pass. Hum, hum—
you can repeat the Commandments, of course,
my child —hum, hum.”
And the shepherd is grieved at the lamb’s frank
confession that he cannot.
“ Oh, but Willie’s a good lad,” chimes in his
mistress. “He knows he’s gotter save, he knows
he’s gotter work. What tex’ did I give yo’ for
to-day?” she cries, turning on the child.
“ Satan finds some mischief still for idle ’ands
ONE MAN'S MEAT', etc.
BIG MAN : “My word, it
does a matt good to see
the rain. Fine thing
for the country
LITTLE MAN : “ Yes, but
damn it, I'm not the
country!"
ter do ! ” chants the boy bending over the refuse.
“ There now ! ” triumphs his mistress. “ An’
he’s got two shillings in his money-box. Haven’t
you, Willie ? For your mother, ain’t it ?”
“ Yes, ’m’ ; she’s pore, an’ ole, an’ ’ard-workin’
— an’ a widder. An’ she reads the Book reg’lar,”
he adds with a sidelong glance at Mr. Gabble.
But piety such as this is clearly its own reward,
none of a visible nature being produced.
“ A devout lad,. I see. Quaint, too, very
quaint,” murmurs the shepherd as the ward re-
pairs to his sty. “ His mother not married, you
say. Quite so ; not respectable—hum, hum.
Sad, very sad indeed. My heart bleeds for all
such—hum. You keep your valuables under lock
and key—hum—of course. Ah, yes, quite so.
A stray lamb. Yea, one wandereth. Hum ! I
do not wish to disparage the —hum—boy, but is
there not something criminal —hum —in his eye ?’’
His voice suddenly changes to one of consterna-
tion :
“ You have your purse safe, my dear, I hope ! ”
he asks his wife.
Reassured on the point, he takes his ladies for
a stroll round the premises the while the dishes
are washed. Meanwhile, Mrs. Gabble slyly
cross-examines the scullery, leaving no pot-lid un-
lifted, no saucepan unsmelt.
Later, the milliner, tiring of the parlor, strolls
the yards alone. Wandering to the cow fence she
compassionates the. boarded-out to the extent of
sixpence. Whereat he becomes confidential. He
is “ doing a break ” shortly. His is a “rotten
job ” —too much blanky work ; too many blanky
beltings with the leg-rope.
No, he has no ‘ ‘ pore ole muvver. ” That is ‘ ‘ all
bis eye. ” He is going to his aunt, who has a
laundry in Fitzroy. Yes, he has enough for his
fare—has “ half ajim” concealed in secret places.
No, it isn’t stolen—earnings, all of it. Trooper
McDermott, down at Quandong, has been his
employer in some instances. “ On’y yest’day he
give me a sprat fer c’llectin’ wattle fer his gal to
wear to the darnce ter-night.”
“ What girl?” asks Miss Dunn, stonily.
“ Why, ole Rafferty’s stuck-up piece, o’
Course,” he replies. “ An’ ’e tole me to say
nothink —‘ mum’ wuzthe word, ’e sez.”
When the enraged milliner has quite done
shaking him and calling him “liar,” the boy
dusts himself and, diving into his capacious
trousers, extracts the sixpenny bit. This he
fingers gaily, with a half-crown which leapt from
the agitated Miss Dunn’s possession during the
shaking. Then, burrowing with his bucket under
the flanks of his cow, he is seen no more.
Late that night, Policeman McDermott is tread-
ing the “two-step” with his new love, the her-
ring-faced Miss Rafferty. He stifles the prickings
of conscience anent the cast-off Miss Dunn with
dreams of rapid promotion, added to probable
legacies such time as Sergeant Rafferty shall fall
asleep for ever. He becomes more assiduous in
his attentions, and murmurs tenderlv of
rings.
Just then a note labelled “ Urgent ” is handed to
him by the door-keeper.

him in many places at once. The instinct of

standpoint of the moralist, scarcely to be distinguished
from the native convicts in the fo’c’s’le, or the Japanese

Canadian canoes, looked only made for one. A consign-

Extract from diary at sea.
THIS is the Land of On-Laisse-Faire :
Likewise and also Je menfais.
The grey sky simmers o’er the bare
And bitter sea of steely blue.
What we may think, or say, or do,
There is not any man will care—
So long as we will leave him, too,
Within his land of On-Laisse-Faire.
There is a something in the air
(The latitude is close on two) —
The steamy atmosphere, the glare,
The tropic touch that makes us do
What we would almost surely rue
If we were back in street and square.
The Ten Commandments get askew
Here in the Land of On-Laisse-F'aire.
What matter if a lady fair
Remains alone with Don’t-ask-who
(At least I know / wasn’t there),
With cabin locked an hour or two ?
Perchance they talked of Dandaloo,
Or spent the time in pious prayer.
The air may turn a trifle blue ;
But—it’s the Land of On-Laisse-Faire.
Was ever seen a sight so rare ?
In truth, we are a parlous crew !
With almond eyes and jetty hair
The maids of Nippon teach to woo.
If we should spy a canvas shoe
Where there is not much room to spare,
We never question what’s to do.
This is the Land of On-Laisse-Faire.
We carry cows and gee-gees there
Down aft; for’ard we’ve convicts, too,
Who sit and spit and growl and glare.
We sip our whiskies all day through,
Or listen while the cattle moo.
A subtle perfume haunts the air;
Is it stdph. hyd. or boiling glue?
What ho ! the fish ! but On-Laisse-Faire.
Ye tourists all, who know not where
travel for sensations new,
Vv ith listless eyes and blase air—
Behold ! this is the place for you !
From furthest China to Peru
Come to enjoy the smells and glare
Wherein we swear and swill and stew,
The rare old realms of On-Laisse-Faire /

THE Spring wind, brother,
With marching music blows ;
Birds call to one another,
Clouds pass, and water flows.
Children of the Mother,
We go where the Wind goes.
New thoughts prick
sharper
Than spears at old
Despair.
Who can be a carper
At Joy—a thrall to
Care ?
The Wind is a harper
That plays a lively air.
O ! the thousand pities
Of folk in prison
pent !
We pipe the careless
ditties
Our brother Wind has
sent,
And leave the narrow
cities
To roam a continent.
The roads are ringing
With carols of the
morn,
Beckoning, and bringing
Fresh hopes to hearts
forlorn.
The Wizard Roads go
swinging,
Beyond the Gates of
Horn.
The bush %. sweeter,
fairer
Than any mortal love.
Her eyes are deeper,
rarer
Than any stars above.
But none but he may
snare her
Who savage blood can
prove.
Immortal Love possesses
The lover of her choice.
She thrills with wild caresses
That more than wine rejoice,
Or soothes with sleepy tresses
And low melodious voice.
Through hilly lands and hollow
Where many wonders are,
Like our swift sister Swallow
Away, away, afar,
With wander-lust we follow
Her gleam and Morning Star.
We love our sisters’ glances,
Sweet sisters Trees and Streams,
Our brother Sun’s romances
Ablaze with golden gleams.
The Vision of St. Francis
Unbars the door of dreams.
The day’s enchanting
Out on the open road.
We fear no canting,
We bear no weary load,
But march on, ranting
Rough runes, to our abode.
We are Arabs pitching,
Beneath the desert palm,
A Tent of Peace, and stitching
The starry hours of calm
Into our dreams bewitching
With beauty and with balm.
We are gipsy rovers
That, since the world began.
Where’er the blue sky covers
Went gay with caravan,
Of woods and water lovers,
Free woman and free man.
With chivalrous bravado
That makes the weakling quail,
True knights, for El Dorado
Or Bimini we sail.
On gallant, grand crusado
We seek the Holy Grail.
Our road the Wandering Jew’s is
O’er Steppes and Viking sea ;
We learn the swagman’s uses ;
And rebels such as we
Refill the old-world cruses
With primal energy.
The song of winds and waters
Thrills every nerve and vein ;
Lust of anarchic slaughters
Burns ever in our brain.
For we are sons and daughters
Of Nomad Tubal-Cain.
We have the gladness
Of Fire and Air and Flood,
The mysterious sadness
Of Forests in our blood.
The ancient Earth-gods’ madness
Inspires our Brotherhood.
With barbaric handles
We shatter Custom's domes.
We scrape rough sandals
In pompous, pious homes.
Eternal Goths and Vandals
We shake world-weary Romes.

LOUIS ESSON.
The Whale-Bailiff.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
first black whale of the season had been
I caught and towed into the trying-out works.
-L Captain Shank leaned over the skid watch-
ing the half-caste crew unship the anchors and
buoy from the fretting launch in the fairway.
The October sun flared on the greasy waters of
GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH AT
GRABBEN GULLEN.
INSPECTOR : “ What is a 1 lake'?"
THE BRIGHT NEW BOY : “ Place, sir , a
hole in a tay-pot."
East Boyd, where the tide-heaped skulls and
fluke ends lay in Dantesque cairns along the surf-
hammered bays and inlets. Coils of rancid smoke
floated from the works, making the eyes smart and
filling the throat and, lungs with particles of fried
whale.
A half-caste ascended the skid leisurely, haul-
ing a slice of blubber on his shoulder. At his hip
dangled a butcher’s steel. Blood and oil ran down
his elbows. Casting the blubber on the floor of
the shed he returned to the remnants of a bull
“ humpy ” in the doorway.
Captain Shank worried his cigar as he strolled
to the narrow strip of beach under the skid. ‘‘ We
must shake things up this season, my lads ” —he
addressed the cutters-up, who were idling in
groups about the works. “ This constant yarning
don’t help me much. Three hundred spent on a
new launch and fighting-irons this year, and the
vats only half filled.”
Greig, the harpooner, seemed to echo a thought
that fretted the captain’s mind. Wiping his
blubber-coated fingers with a wisp of grass, he
addressed him in an undertone.
“ Saw a feller this mornin’ what looked un-
common like a bailiff, cap’n. One of Wardrup’s
chaps, what sold us the launch and whaleboats.
He’s been hangin' about Kiah like a moultin’
hawk.”
Shank’s face grew purple in the hot sunlight.
“ Do you mean that fat little waster I saw on the
pier at Eden yesterday ? What’s his business as
a bailiff, anyhow ? ”
“ The ile an’ bone, cap’n, an’ other froots of our
labour. ” The harpooner left his place at the board
to throw a handful of waste blubber under the
cauldrons. The flames leaped and roared as
though a tin of resin had been cast in, while the
pans above. sizzled and spurted streams of oil
into the tanks beneath.
Bailiffs had visited Twofold Bay in the past.
Casual American speculators had been known to
start whaling with a mortgaged outfit, consisting
of boats, fighting irons, boilers and vats. Then a
no-whale season came, and things began to wear
an unfinancial appearance. In the present in-
stance the works had only begun operations in
September after 10 months of idleness, and it
seemed as though Shank's creditors were a trifle
over-anxiofis.
Captain Shank paced the beach sullenly, his
glance wandering from time to time across the
bay half-seen through the dense mulberry bushes.
Greig voiced the captain’s thoughts pithily.
“ This bailiff is too cute to make a fuss until we’ve
finished cuttin’ up the beast. But the minit our
tanks an’ vats are full of ile, he'll pounce in with
a writ an’ take possession. *'
Shank grunted an inaudible word as he returned
to the shed. A coil of rancid blubber-smoke
enveloped him. He paused,.and sneezed violently.
“Ile and bone is as good as money these
times,” went on the harpooner. “ Hard on us
chaps havin’ to get up in the night an’ fight whales
so’s a bailiff can claim every bit’cept the beard.
There's British law what protects us from bein’
robbed of the beard, ain’t there, cap’n ?”
“ Blow the beard ! That derned throat of
yours flutes like a gaspipe. Shake up those fires. ”
Greig shuffled away meekly to where the half-
flenched “humpy” was being sundered on the
skid. The great skull, red as bull-beef, rocked
as the narrow spades delved and sliced into the
crossbone. Strips of cream-white blubber uncoiled
into serpentine lengths over the floor. Under the
skid, where the oily water rotted and bubbled, a
swarm of schnapper and bream guzzled like
aldermen.
Captain Shank paced up and down between
the blubber-fed fires, and again his eyes wandered
to the dense mulberry bushes that lined the hills
above the shed.
“ Blamed if I know where he can hide. I sup-
pose he’s watching us now. If ever I see his nose
inside this shed I’ll give him a whale-poultice.”
The crew of slashing, delving black boys
laughed loudly. “Show yer where’e ’ides to-
morrer, cap’n.” Greig drew away a six-foot roll
of fat and slapped it on the cutting-board with
the air of a bacon-curer. “ I’ll show yer where
’e 'ides, cap’n, with his eye on the shed, reckonin’
up every drop of ile that runs into the tubs. He’s
over at Eden now drinkin’ beer with the cow-
farmers what harpoon cheeses up Bega way.”
When night came the whale-cutters retired to
the huts overlooking the bay. The half-castes
soused their bodies in ash water to loosen the
rancid fat that clung to their limbs. Two full-
blooded aboriginals slept peacefully in their oil-
soaked skins. And they slept alone.
At daybreak the work of cutting up the 60-ton
black whale began with a rush. The smell of
early morning whale is a thing that leaps and
holds. In the new-comer it throttles all desire
for food, and yet the seasoned harpooner is seen
eating bread and meat, with blubber-slimed
hands, over a cauldron of roaring fat.
A swarm of slate-colored flies settled on the
carcase. From fluke to head they buzzed and
feasted. Even the blackfellows grunted when
the swarm rose under the flenching knives, cling-
ing to the dripping beef until flung into the flame-
wrapped pans.
“ Flies, oh damn the flies. They eat up a
whale faster than the killers! ” The captain
stalked from the shed and his eye fell upon a half-
caste youngster baiting a shark-line from the punt.
He shook his fist at the sky.
“ Get to work, you loafer ! How’s a man to
make ends meet if you're going to squat round
with a can of prawns and a hook ? Get ! ”
“He's after Jack, ther blue pointer, cap'n,”
explained the harpooner. “ Yer can’t leave an
inch o’ whale hangin’ over the skid. The swine
took half-a-ton o’ blubber yesterday an’ scooted
with it across the bay.”
The harpooner drew his knife down the
butcher’s steel at his side and beat back the
swarms of flies from his face. “ Ther sharks
worries the life out of yer,” he said finally. “Ef
it wasn’t for the fires they’d come into the shed
an’ drink the ile.”
A cool sea-wind flooded the trying-out works.
The black smoke lifted and the sun revealed
five blood-dripping men, steels at hip, spad-
ing and flenching the Gargantuan mass on the
floor. At times their feet slipped on the greasy
skids, and they clutched with both hands at skull
and fin-bone to steady themselves.
The blubber-fed fires burned with a shrill, wind-
like sound. The boilers moaned and heaved as
the junks of red beef splashed in.
“ Can’t afford flues,” said someone, “so we’ve
got to eat the smoke. I guess a South Coast
whaler would enjoy himself in Hell.”
Greig touched the captain's arm stealthily, and
THE SMITHS IN MELBOURNE.
LITTLE SMITH (of the Scrub , down for Christ-
mas): “By cripes, they s a pack o' people
in town t’-day, dad!"
BIG SMITH : “ True for ye. I reckon the coach
has just come in."
pointed to an empty cask standing on the beach.
“ That’s the bailiff’s look-out station, he said
huskily. “ I see him sneak in this mornin’. He
reckons we’ll have tried out the whale to-day.”
Captain Shank regarded the innocent-looking
cask savagely. He noticed that the bung-hole was
turned towards the works. Walking casually
along the beach, he approached the cask from the
rear and peeped over.
The shed hands watched him hilariously.
Nothing happened. Shank returned on tip-toe,
nodding brightly.
“ Skunk’s asleep,” he said softly. “ Got full
of beer last night, I suppose. We’ll have to wake
him.”
One of the men walked over to the half-caste
and attached the shark line to a io-fathom tow
rope. Then, approaching the cask leisurely, he
made a large slip knot and passed it round the
middle.
Captain Shank now joined the half-caste with the
shark line. “ Put some whale’s liver on the
hook,” he said hurriedly, “and let go smartly the
moment you feel a strong pull. The other end is
fast to the bailiff.”
The fresh-baited shark hook was cast far out
into the bay, while the shed-hands prayed for the
coming of Jack, the blue pointer. The captain
returned to the works.
The sun seemed to dance on the oil-illumined
bay where the slow-winged mollie-hawks wheeled
lazily over the sandbars. Shoals of mullet and
bream leaped in and out the offal-strewn inlet,
while dozens of voracious schnapper darted under
the skid and vanished mysteriously.
The tense silence was broken by a sudden yell
from the half-caste with the line. His legs flew
out wildly, his white teeth flashed as he hung on
to the straining rope.
“ Let go, y’ blamed idiot, let go! ” thundered
Shank.
The harpooner’s face appeared at the shed door.
“ My gawd, why don’t ’e let go ! ”
The line twanged and writhed in the half-
caste’s grip. At that moment the bailiff’s pale
forehead rose cautiously over the edge of the cask
and then vanished with magic brevity.
“Let go!” roared the captain. The line
switched in and out violently ; the cask flew like
an aeroplane for half a dozen yards, and descended
with a rush into the water. The line strained as
though a maddened bullock were at the end draw-
ing the cask with thfe speed of a motor-launch
from the shore.
The bailiff glared over the edge of the cask at
the baited shark struggling to free itself from the
hooked line. Then, crouching to the bottom, he
tried to steady himself against the ferocious
plunging that threatened to pitch him overboard.
“ We got a Chinaman that way last year,”
drawled Shank, “but he had the savvy to cut the
line. This man has never seen a buckjumping
shark before.”
The bailiff’s white face was visible as the cask
tore through the water. Shank sat on the beach
and lit a cigar, while the shed hands returned to
their work cheerfully.
The cask began to gyrate in the tideway. One
moment the frantic shark would flash round
wrapping 49ft. of rope about the cask. The next
saw it unwinding and thrashing the sea until the
bailiff began to spin like a motor-driven wheel.
“ Ef a shark worked that way for nine hours a
day,” said Greig, “ he’d be as good as a io-horse
power gas engine. Wonder they don’t use the
Port Jackson sharks fer towin’ the flagship round
to the Melbourne Cup.”
Gradually the tearing mill race between cask
and shark ceased. At midday the long grey body
of the blue pointer floated to the surface under the
lee of the half-paralysed bailiff.
A tense silence followed until the bailiffs face
appeared over the
stave - head. He
glared at the men
in the shed and
at the dead mon-
ster lying under his
nose.
“By Heaven, I’ll
gaol you all for
this, you pack of
scoundrels. I’ll fight
you with the police
when I come
ashore. ”
“We’ve got an
odour in that shed,”
answered Shank
defiantly, “ that’ll
protect us against
the law. Don’t
talk to honest
whalers about the
police.”
All through the
hot noon the bailiff
sweltered in the
cask, the outgoing
tide carrying him
farther and farther
from the shed.
And as he watched
he saw the big
launch load up
with precious bar-
rels of oil and
bone, and steam
across the bay to-
wards the Sydney-
bound steamer
lying at the pier.
Near midnight,
when the stars
winked over Two-
fold Bay, the har-
pooner put off in a
dinghy towards the
cask. A bottle of
beer lay between
his feet. Tie rowed close in silently and coughed.
“Bill !’’ He peeped over the edge and looked
down at the bailiff, huddled at the bottom. “Bill,
’ave you ’ad enough ? ”
The bailiff made no answer, but in the dark-
ness the harpooner saw a live gleam in his eye.
“ Bill, for Gawd’s sake don’t put on side ’cause
yer live in a ’ouse-boat,” he whispered.
The bailiff’s right hand shot out suddenly and
touched the harpooner’s. “No bloomin’ sermons,
Greig,” he said tremulously. “ Where’s the
beer ? ”
We had the bailiff to dinner that night. Recog-
nising that we were men of affairs, he behaved
with commendable forbearance, since every ounce
of bone and oil was on its way to Sydney.
We satisfied his claim later on.

FOR THE BULLETIN.
I HE brundub thunder snarched above
The swisslembifferous sea.
While drimbled Mugfrubs boofkutunked
And Swunklers crunked in glee.
It was the Brunkencrungercrob
That shoddled in the blast,
The Mugfrubs fierce had blooked the screw
And swonglecranked the mast.
The flearded few that held the dpck
Were streeieweeled with fright.
For oh, the frightful Swankterbowsh
Was skirpling through the night
They saw the Unkterspronks at play -
Their souls in horror sunk.
The Unkterspronks, the Swankterbowsh,
The Hootlejumptibunk ,
And as the stykled ship went down
The Swankterbowsh drew nigh
And morgled them by twos and threes
A glumbrious way to die.
He slorpaljised the lot! And then
The Hootlejumptibunk
Came at him, with a sterkrious yell
And hortched him with a crunk
The brundub thunder snarched above
The swisslembtfferous sea,
VVhile drimbled Mugfrubs boofkutunked
And Swunklers crunked in glee

Two Girls More!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I DON’T know what I want with you —
There are two girls more !
Yet never has the sky been blue
Since you slammed the door.
It’s rather hard to manage, too,
Three, or sometimes four—
I don’t know what I want with you,
But I still adore
And still desire, and yearn for, though,
As I’d fain be true
To two girls more, I do not know
What I want with you.
The spots I used to haunt with you
Dearest are; although
I don’t know what I want with you
Now that things are so,
I’d somehow like a jaunt with you
Where we used to go:
I don’t know what I want with you,
Maybe you would know.
However, lightest songs may be
Deep festooned with woe:
And this, though what I want with three
Really I don’t know,
Will tell your heart, what once it knew,
Now I love as then.
So, dear, whate’er I want with you,
Come to me again !
VICTORIA.
BERNARO O'DOWD.
Some People and a Shark.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE stout old gentleman with the towel and
the bathing-suit in his hand stood on the cliff
path, in the shadow of a tree, and looked
down at the sunny crescent of sea. It was breath-
lessly hot, and the tree
locusts were singing joy-
ously their shrill summer
song; a hundred feet
below the amethyst water
laughed cool, mellow
laughs amongst the brown
rocks and tinkled the
shells on the shelving
beach. The old gentle-
man paused only until he
had regained his breath,
and then went stumping
down the steep hill path
that led to the bathing
box. The tree locusts
sang on, the sun blazed,
and somewhere in the
scrub a bird twittered
sleepily and was still.
Five minutes after the
old gentleman had gone
down the cliff, the Cad-
ger came dragging along
the path, and stopped to
rest within an inch or so
of the spot whence the
old gentleman had sur-
veyed the bay. His lazy
eye roamed leisurely over
the prospect, and at last
rested with some interest
on a dark patch in the
deep water just outside
the little point. In a
minute or so the patch
moved slowly, like a sub-
marine patrol, to the op-
posite point of the bay,
where it turned and
stopped.
The Cadger’s eyes
dilated eagerly, and he
stepped on a log to ob-
tain a better view. “An
eighteen - footer ! ” he
whispered. “ Blimey !
’e’ll get one of them
bathin’ blokes yet if ’e
calls at th’ right time!
There isn’t no one to snap
at 12 o'clock of a Mon-
day ! ”
The submarine started
slowdy across the bay
again in a straight line ;
but half-way across it
stopped, turned sharply
at right-angles, and lay
with its head pointing in-
shore.
A faint sound of human
splashing and snorting
floated up over the edge
of the cliff and shocked the Cadger into
action. Jumping off the log, he fought his
way through the bushes to the very edge
of the rocky precipice, and, shading his eyes
with his hand, gazed down at the water. He be-
held the ill-fated old gentleman swimming labor-
iously towards a flat, isolated rock.from the shore
side, and the shark gliding very easily toward the
same objective from the deep water.
“Look out!” yelled the Cadger. “Look
out, carn’t yer ! ”
The result was disastrous. The old gentleman
stopped swimming and started to tread water with
his face towards the shore.
“What?” shouted the swimmer angrily,
“ Who’s calling ? ”
The Cadger danced like one demented on the
cliff, and shrieked, “ Swim ! swim, carn’t
yer ! ”
Back from the water came a defiant shout of
“ I’ll swim where I like 1 ”
The frenzied Cadger saw the shark glide to
within ten yards of the man in the water. He
pointed a ragged arm dead at the monster and
shrieked with all his strength, “Shark ! shark !
swim T’ th’ rock ! ! ”
Instantly there was a turmoil in the water as if
the twin screws of a liner had started at full speed.
Before the foam had stopped hissing, the old
gentleman was shivering on the rock island with
badly scraped knees. The shark had retired a
hundred yards to seaward.
As soon as he saw that the old gentleman was
safe, the Cadger hurried down the path and
running along the beach picked his way over the
rocks to the point opposite the old gentleman’s
refuge. Then, across the intervening twenty-five
yards of water he shouted, “ I seen th’ cow
cornin’ at yer, Mister ! I thought yer was a
goner ! ”
Fie looked for some words of gratitude ; but
the old gentleman was half-crazed with shock )
and the shame of owing his life to the dirtiest
man he had ever seen didn’t help him to take a
calm view of the matter. The best he could do
was to shake his fist at the amazed Cadger and
bellow, “You blackguard! Why didn’t you
warn me ? ”
“ Why, Mister, I tried t’ warn yer ! ”
“ I don’t believe you. You let me go in on
purpose! ”
The Cadger was abject from life-long habit.
Instead of being honestly indignant, he whined,
“ It’s th’ thruth I’m tellin’ yer. I didn’t know
ther-e was enyone in th’ worter ! ”
The old gentleman chattered with rage, and
shook his fist. “ I tell you again I don’t believe
you. You let me go in knowing the shark was
there. Youhe lying to me, you ruffian ! ”
“ I ain’t, I tell yer. I jus’ seen th’ shark afore
I ’eard yer splashin’.”
The old gentleman wheeled round on his
sea-pedestal and looked angrily at the unbroken
surface. “Well, where is the d—d shark ? I
don’t see any shark ! ”
The Cadger couldn’t see it, either, not being at
a sufficiently high elevation. However, he did
his best to do so by peering anxiously at the sea.
“ I don’t see any shark,” repeated the old
gentleman once more after a pause. He faced
the wretched Cadger, and, holding up two fingers
like an archbishop pronouncing a benediction,
solemnly said, “ You’re lying to me. There isn't
a shark at all ! ”
“ As Gord is me witness ” —began the Cadger.
But the old gentleman cut him short. “Now
don’t try and bolster up your lies with that sort of
thing. There isn’t a shark at all ! ”
“There is ! There is !” wailed the wretch on
the shore.
“There isn’t!” shouted the old gentleman.
“ You’re lying to me and trying to frighten me
into giving you money ! I know your type ! I
suppose,” he added, “I suppose you think I’m
frightened ? ”
“ Now, look ’ere, Mister ”
“ I’m not frightened ! I don’t believe there’s
a shark at all, and just to prove that I believe you
to be a liar, I’m going to swim ashore ! ”
As he spoke, an immense fin cut the surface
behind the rock and disappeared.
Inarticulate with horror, the Cadger pointed to
the spot where the fin had been.
The old gentleman turned and, of course, saw
nothing.
“ Confound you ! What are you pointing at,
you fool ? ”
The Cadger gulped and managed to blurt out,
“ Tli shark ! ”
The old gentleman looked again to make cer-
tain that there was nothing, and then, turning
towards his saviour, solemnly promised to lay an
information against him the moment he got
ashore, or as soon thereafter as possible. “ And,
myfriend,” he concluded, “ you take yourself off as
quickly as you can. If you don’t, old as I am,
I’ll give you a hiding you won’t forget ! ” He
hitched his bathing-dress impatiently over his
shoulder, and, stepping gingerly down to the
water’s edge, made ready to plunge in again.
“ Now don’t linger, my man,” he snorted. “ I’m
coming ashore now, and if you're there when I
arrive I’ll kick you as far as the cliffs ! ” He
advanced for the plunge and raised his arms.
“ F’r Gord’s sake don’t, Mister ! ”, pleaded the
Cadger.
The old gentleman paused furious on the brink.
“ Shut up, I say ! If you attempt to frighten me
again I’ll throttle you ! ”
“There!!!” whispered the Cadger .with
triumphant horror, one rigid arm extended at the
big black fin hovering in mid-channel. The man
in the bathing-suit took one breathless glance,
and, turning, scrambled hurriedly on to the
highest pinnacle of the rock, where he sat down
limply.
Then there was a much-needed interval for a
readjustment of attitudes. The shark waited
patiently as if it expected to be fed.
“ I seen ’im from th’ top of th’ cliff,” began
the Cadger, proudly. “I sez to meself, ‘an
eighteen-footer,’ I sez. ‘ Now, wot if some gen-
nelman was t’ come down f’r a swiu ? ’E’d
stand a good charnce o’ bein’ snapped ! So I
made up me mind to watch th’ cow. Then I
’eard you splashin’! ”
The bather stared dully at the fin and made no
reply.
The Cadger waited for a moment and then con-
tinued: “ Soon’s I ’eard you splashin’ I ups and
sez, ‘ ’ Ullo’ I sez, ‘ that sounds like someone in
th’ worter ! ’ So I gets up and goes t’ th’ edge of
th’ cliff, an’ w’en I looks out I sees somethin’
bobbin’ erbout 50 yards from th’ shore with this
’ere cow only erbout 10 yards be’ind. ‘ Surely ,’
I sez, ‘ surely it ain’t a man ! ’ Then I ’ad
another good look t’ make certain, and ‘Yes,’ I
sez”
At this point the quivering old gentleman burst
into passionate speech. “And all this time you
were talking to yourself like a fool, I was risking
my life ! Why the devil didn’t you warn me at
once ? ”
“ W’y, Mister ! I did warn yer ! ”
“You didn’t ! You say yourself that you stood
muttering there like an idiot! What did you
want to talk to yourself for ?”
“ I wasn't torkin’t’ meself !•”
“Confound you, you just told me that you
were ! ”
“Well, then, I was tkinkin' t’ meself ! ”
“Why didn't you shout out tome at once :
‘ There’s a shark in the deep water behind you
and he’s swimming slowly in on the other side of
the rock. Don’t try to swim to the shore ! Turn
round and swim to the rock ? ’ Why didn’t you
cry out something sensible, like that ?”
The Cadger w 7 as justly indignant at the sugges-
tion. “ Blimey, Mister, I wouldn’t ’a’ ’ad time !
An’, even if I ’ad ’ad time, yer wouldn’t ’ave
understood me ! If I’d tried t’ tell yer all that
from th’ cliff yer would ’a’ got all mixed up !
Most likely you’d ’ave lorst yer ’ead ! ”
“ I wouldn't have lost my head ! ”
“ Well, yer mightn’t ’ave ’eard me ! ”
“ I zvould have heard
you ! ”
“Yer mightn’t ’ave
’eard me,” retorted the
Cadger, desperately. “ I
ain’t a ’uman fog’orn,
yo’ know.”
“ I would have heard
every word you said ! ”
insisted the old gentle-
man, who wasn’t a very
reasonable person even in
his calmest moments.
The Cadger, utterly
crushed, sat down on a
handy rock, and was pro-
ceeding to sulk when he
was roused to action by
an angry cry from the
marooned bather. Point-
ing at the sentinel’s fin,
the helpless man de-
manded : “ Why don’t
you frighten that brute
away instead of sitting
there like a fool ? Throw
something at it, can’t
you ?”
The Cadger picked up
a small rock and hurled
it perfunctorily at the
shark, which disappeared
in a soft swirl of water.
“Now, how am I to
get back ? ”
The Cadger looked at
the haunted w-ater and
measured the distance
with his eye. “Y’ can
do it in twenty strokes ! ”
The bather hopped
with rage at the sugges-
tion. “Swim!” he
shouted. “You scoun-
drel ! do you think I’m
going to risk my life by
swimming ? Go and get
me a boat at once ! ”
“ It’s two miles t’ th’
boat’ouse,” demurred the
perspiring loafer.
“ I don’t care if it’s
two hundred ! Get me a
boat at once, or I’ll have
you prosecuted ! ”
At this point the worm
began to turn. “ Look
’ere, Mister, it’s no- use
threatenin’ me ! I’m not
goin’ t’ be rousted on be
th’ likes o’ you ! W’y,
you would a been killed
but fr me warnin’ yer !”
The managing director
on the rock forgot his
unfortunate position in
his wrath. Pointing with
a shaking finger at the
wretch ashore, he said
through his clenched
teeth, “ Stop talking and
go for a boat at once ! ”
“ Yer said yer wasn’t
frightened ! taunted the
Cadger.
“Neither I am !”
snapped the marooned.
“ Well, swim it ! ”
The director was looking at the water with a
speculative eye when eighteen feet of shark glode
once more through the channel. That decided
him. He sat down and started to talk inco-
herently about Five Shillings and Two Miles.
Sometimes in his agitation he said Two Shillings
and Five Miles. But the Cadger didn’t seem to
be interested in either version of the monologue
he sat down in a cool recess and looked wretchedly
at an outward-bound steamer.
“ Well, confound you, aren’t you going ? ”
The direct inquiry startled the Cadger out ol
his reverie, and he got to his feet. “ Goin’
where ?” he whined;

The marooned old gentleman stormed at him
as well as a fat man in a bathing-suit could.
“For a boat ! D’ye mean to say you haven’t
grasped what I want ? Go—and — get — a — boat! ”
“ What for ? ”
“ For five shillings, you blackguard ! Five
shillings and not a penny more.”
The Cadger uprose with a look of’ determina-
tion. He wanted five shillings badly, but five
shillings wouldn’t have tempted him to walk two
miles in that heat. He might have considered it
towards sundown, but the thought was unbear-
able just then. In the back of his brain he
cherished a vague hope that the marooned would
offer him a pound if he made a show of deserting
him ; so he turned his back and made his way
shoreward very slowly, in order to give the old
gentleman time to think it over. No heartrend-
ing cry of distress arrested his progress, but he
went resolutely on his way until he was half-way
up the cliff. Then he turned and almost swooned
with disappointment. The old gentleman was
wildly signalling a fishing party of three in a skiff
which had just turned the corner.
The unhappy Cadger waited in an agony of
doubt until he saw that the rescue was inevitable.
Then he turned and went courageously down to
receive the bather when he landed. A happy
inspiration struck him en route, and, hastily
gathering up the bather’s garments and towel, he
proceeded apace to the landing place and waited
like a sad caricature of a valet.
The old gentleman was busy explaining how he
had come to be marooned, consequently he didn’t
notice the waiting Cadger until the rower had
brought the skiff alongside the rock ledge and was
looking for a landing. Then his bulging eye lit
on the abject, dirty man holding his nice, clean
clothes, and he roared explosively; “ What the
devil are you doing with those clothes ? ”
“’Sorright, Mister,” faltered the Cadger un-
easily.
“It isn’t all right ! Put them down at once !”
“ In ’ere,” muttered the dirty man, indicating
meanwhile a small, natural dock just large enough
to accommodate the skiff.
‘ ‘ Will — you — put — those — clothes —down ! ”
The enraged old gentleman stood up in the
boat, and the two amazed fishermen suspended all
navigation to watch him.
The Cadger looked pathetically at the owner of
the clothing. “ ’ Sorright, Mister,” he pleaded ;
“ I'm only ’ oldin ’ them for yer ! ”
“Well, don't hold them ! Go away and mind
your own business ! ”
“ I was goin’ fr the boat wen I seen these two
gennelmen coinin’ round th’ corner, so I sez t’
meself” /
“ Don’t try to tell me any lies ! You weren’t
going for the boat at all ! Now put those clothes
down and clear out ! ”
“ Now look’ere, Mister ” ——
“ Will you do what I tell you ? Put those
clothes down and go away ! ”
“’Old on a minit, now, Mister! I wanter
know if I’m goin’t’ get anything fr me trouble.”
“ Why don't you do what the gentleman tells
yer ? ” asked the rower.
“ Becos he wants t’ get outer payin’ me f’r
goin’ fr th’ boat! ” whined the Cadger.
The old gentleman choked. “ Why, you didn't
go for any boat at all ! You were going away,
you scoundrel ! ”
“I wasn’t!” retorted the Cadger. “ I was
goin’ f r a boat ! An’ don’t you ferget,” he added,
“ an’ don’t ferget that I saved yer life fer yer /”
(Here the rower and his friend looked at each
other, obviously impressed and shocked.)
IN THE SPINIFEX.
JIM (in the background): “ Yes, 'e's a clever feller, Bill is. There ain't no flies on him.”
“You didn’t do anything of the kind, sir!
You just howled out something about a shark ! ”
The Cadger, the clothes clutched to his bosom,
then ignored the old gentleman and addressed
himself to the fishermen. “Look ’ere, yous
blokes, I seen th’ shark from th’ top of th’ cliff,
an’ I risked me neck ff warn’im, an’ ’e’s been
roustin’ on me ever since. What sorter treat-
tnent’S that, eh ? An’then, w’en I was startin’t’
ft 0 a ' 3oat ’' m ”"T
“ You infernal liar ! ” interjected the maddened
bather.
“ Steady, Mister,” muttered the rower. “He
was goin’ up th’ cliff when we come round th’
corner point. I seen ’im meself. Didn’t you
notice him, Jack? ”
“ That’s right,’’ assented the other.
“ Fair doos,” remarked the Cadger, “ I ain’t
askin’ any more than fair doos. ”
The Dather, who had sat down, struggled to his
feet and pointed at his garments. “Before we
say any more, I’ll ask you again. Now,
sir : put—those — clothes — doiun ! . . . PUT THEM
down ! 1 ”
The Cadger jumped as if he had been kicked,
and deposited the things on the rocks.
The rower looked disgustedly at his fare.
“ Lor’ blimey ! you ain’t too perlite to the man !
If I was you, Mister, I’d try and be decent to the
pore cove. ’E ain’t done yer no 'arm, yer know.”
“ Give ’im a charnce, Mister,” advised the
quiet man. “ Yer needn’t get angry because he
saved yer life.”
“ Mind your own business, sir,” shouted the
old gentleman, quite beside himself with rage.
“ If you only knew how this man has irritated
me you wouldn’t be so ready to put your oar in.”
“ While we’re on the subject of oars,” inter-
jected the rower, acidly—“ I say, while we’re on
the subject of oars, don’t ferget that, only for us
stickin’ our oars in you’d still be on that there
rock.”
“ I’m not forgetting, sir ! But I refuse to be
spoken to as this man has spoken to me ! I’m not
accustomed to be badgered by tramps ! ”
The rower relinquished his oars in sudden anger.
“ ’Old on ! Who are you referrin’ to ? Do you
mean t’ say that we're tramps ? ”
The old gentleman was about to explain exactly
what he meant, when something in the water hit
the boat a tremendous blow which drove it broad-
side on to the rocks. The three men scrambled
out pell-mell as the damaged skiff rolled in the
wash of some infuriated sea thing.
“My Gawd!” whispered the rower, “What
was that ? ”
“ There he is!” screamed the Cadger, point-
ing to the monster swimming angrily to and fro a
few yards from where they stood. “ E’s ’ ungry,
that’s wot 'e is ! ”
The quiet man, transformed into a lunatic by
shock, turned to the shivering bather and shouted
in his face, “ If you don’t think it’s worth some-
thing t’ be saved from that, you oughter be shot ! ”
“Oh, don’t be a fool !” yelled the bather.
“ You don’t know what you’re talking about ! ”
“W’yJ yer oughter give th’ pore beggar a
quid ! ”
“Quid tje blowed ! ” shouted the rower.
“ What’s a quid t’ th’ likes o’ him ? ’E oughter
chuck th’ man a fiver! ”
“ Or a tenner ! ” yelled the formerly quiet man
as an amendment.
“ Yer boat’s done in ! ” remarked the Cadger,
sorrowfully.
The angry fishermen turned at the announce-
ment, and beheld the skiff in a waterlogged con-
dition with the bars and fittings floating forlornly
in it.
The rower turned to the bather. “There yer
are, old man. That’s all on account o’ you!
Now I reckon it’s a fair thing for you to part up
th’damage ! What do you say, Jack ? ”
‘ ‘ Say ? W’y, o’ corse he’ll ’ave t’ part up ! ”
Then to the old man : “ There’s no gettin’ outer
this, old bloke ! You aint goin’t’ do us! ”
The old gentleman was about to start dressing
when this speech was fired at him. With a
towel in one hand and his trousers in the other,
he paused and glared desperately at the ship-
wrecked pair. “I will see what I can do for
you ; I won’t say any more than that ! ” Then
he started to towel his head vigorously as if the
matter had been finally disposed of.
“ Oh, won’t yer ? ” began the rower. “Well,
we’ll see if”
“Howard!” A high-pitched female voice
called from the top of the cliff, and the owner of
it, a stout lady with a gossamer veil and sun-
glasses, impatiently waved her handkerchief,
“ Howard ! What on earth have you been doing
all this time ? ”
“ Never mind’er,” growled the man who had
once been quiet. “Th’ question now is, ‘Wot
about that there boat ? ’ ”
“Yes, wot about it?” echoed the rower
threateningly.
“ Hozvardt ”
“I won’t be threatened!” yelled the old
THE RESTFUL LIFE.
BILL WAYBACK (soliloquising): " Yaas, that's what I'll do—give up graft and take in boarders.'*
gentleman. “I warn you two men that I will
not submit to threats ! ”
The two mariners started to argue the matter
heatedly, and the Cadger wailed reproachfully
over and'over again. “ W’y didn't yer let me go
f r th’ boat w’en I wanted to ? There yer are !
Yer oughter let me go f r th’ boat ! ”
Into the midst of the confusiomburst the stout
lady, overheated with exertion and indignation.
“ Ploward ! What are all these men so angry
about, and why aren’t you dressed ? You know
Mrs. Midgely-Blatters is coming to dinner, and
yet here you stand in your oldest bathing-suit
arguing in your usual stupid way with three
strange men ! Really, I think you might have a
little more consideration for me ! ”
The two fishermen didn’t fall back awe-stricken,
as they should have done. They merely glanced
at the furious lady, and shouted at the old gentle-
man as disrespectfully as ever. The Cadger alone
conducted himself in accordance with civilised
usages. He took off his ragged hat and, bowing
apologetically, touched the lady on the arm.
“Don’t mind ’em, lady,” he advised, “they’re
jus’ settlin’ a little private matter about a boat ! ”
The stout, goggled lady—she was rather short-
sighted—peered at the Cadger, and recoiled in
horror. “ Good gracious, what a dirty man !
Don’t dare to come near me ! ”
The dismayed Cadger fell back vanquished, and
in his agitation rolled and unrolled his ragged hat
while he listened to the proceedings.
The stout lady, having repulsed the Cadger
with heavy loss, made straight at her husband, and
fired at him once more her first comprehensive
bundle of questions, with one or two more added
on.
Waving his trousers, the old gentleman broke
into open revolt. “Oh ! d—n Mrs. Midgely-
Blatters ! Don’t you see I’m being pestered by
these men ? Go away and let me settle this
affair ! ”
“ I will not go, and I refuse to have my friends
sworn at ! Tell me at once who these men are
and what they want ! ”
Everybody tried to explain it at the same time,
and the Cadger waltzed wretchedly on the edge
of the uproar chanting, “Well, w’y didn’t yer let
me go f’r th’ boat ? I was goin' f’r th’ boat !
W’y didn’t yer let me go f’r th ; boat ? ”
At the end of three minutes, the stout lady's
voice rose indignantly over the clatter of tongues.
“ I don’t understand one atom of what anyone’s
been saying ! But I would like to know who
that dirty vagrant is and what he is doing here.
He actually had the audacity just now to speak
to me. Who is he ? ”
The Cadger instantly projected himself into
the vortex of argument and commenced his
version of the rescue. It was horribly garbled
and tangled up with innumerable confusing ejacu-
lations or soliloquies like “ Ullo, I sez,” “ Wot’s
this ? I sez. ” The stout lady listened impatiently
for a minute or so and then, pointing a gloved
forefinger at the narrator, remarked decisively,
“ I’m convinced that that man is telling lies ! ”
She then turned to the others, and the wrangle
was resumed, while the unhappy Cadger wrung
his hands and protested unheard in the back-
ground.
The truth was gradually dinned into the stout
lady’s head by each man taking it in turn to ex-
plain, and pointing out the exact spot whence
the Cadger had seen the shark, the broken boat,
the refuge rock and the Cadger himself. Unfor-
unately the shark was not visible, so she had to
take it on trust.
When she had fully grasped the situation, the
stout lady took charge, and, after getting the
names and addresses of the fishermen, ordered
them home. They retired looking very weary
and dazed, and the Cadger shuffled nervously for-
ward as if he expected nothing less than a sen-
tence of six months’ hard.
“As for you,” announced the goggled Judge,
“ as for you, I think you’re the most disgracefully
dirty and untidy man I ever saw in my life. If
you will promise to wash yourself thoroughly—
thoroughly, mind you ! —I will get a bundle of
old clothes ready, and you can call and get them
next Monday. Now, there’s my card with the
address on it, and here’s half a crown, and you
must promise me not to buy beer with it.”
The Cadger humbly received the card and the
coin, and, mumbling his thanks, put on his hat
and scuttled from the vicinity in a thoroughly
frightened state.
When he had gone, the stout lady turned to her
husband. “ How, Howard, if you will be good
enough to put on your clothes, we will get back
as quickly as we can, and apologise to Mrs.
Midgely-Blatters, who no doubt will be simply
furious. I will go and wait for you on the cliffs.
Ido wish you would be more careful. Whenever
you go out alone you seem to do something ridi-
culous and get mixed up with common people.
Now be as quick as you can.”
The stout lady then walked off, and the old
gentleman retired behind a rock and dressed him
self like a man in a trance.

THREE green miles beneath the sea
Lies the spoil we could not hold,
Lies the galleon with her gold.
Fish brush by her weed-hung side ;
Never wave can sway her, she
Has gone through them, far too deep,
And her crew may rest asleep
In the places where they died.
There each man unheeding lies
As he was the night she sank ;
And the cups from which they drank
And the dice which one had cast
Rolling ’neath his comrades’ eyes
Lie beside their whitened bones.
Flagons set with precious stones
Count for little at the last.
When she sank there in our sight
With a little lapping sound
Slight as but a skiff had drowned—
Staggering we turned to go ;
For our ship had felt the fight.
To the sunset showed our wake,
Writhing like a wounded snake,
Till we came to Samballo. . . .
Shapeless sea-beasts coil and creep
On her rotting cedar deck
Past her crew, who little reck
Of the trespass, if they know.
Mary give them happy sleep !
Surely now beneath the wave
They have found as green a grave
As the sun-bathed earth can show.

The Song of Broken English.
(And by this Cape goe the PortingaleS to their Spicerie.)
[For Tii f, Bii i. h nt in.
5 a Song of Broken English —German
and Russian and Dane—
Sung by a bush-bred mongrel, as mad as
the Prince—or as sane ;
Austrian, Swiss and Polack—and a song of
greater things,
By a “beery Bulletin scribbler” with the
blood of old Danish kings.
Henry the son of Peter ; Peter the son of Lars,
Through the race of poets and pirates under the
frozen stars.
Back to the Thirteen, sailing on Friga’s Day to
war,
To the pillage of Scotland and England, and the
worship of Odin and Thor.
Northward they went from Holland, round by the
frozen sea,
Seeking a phantom passage to “ goe to their
spicerie.” ,
Read the tale of the White Waste, where the
splintering iceberg floats,
The tale of a Dutchman, Barents ! his ship and
his open boats !
Holland ! half-drowned, but triumphant, in the
spirit that never shall yield,
When the sea drove back her invaders, and her
fleet sailed over the field !
Dutchmen, as lean as coolies, fighting for Liberty,
And Holland, at peace, reclaiming the whole of
the Zuyder Zee !
Southward they sailed from Lisbon, the track of
the “ Portingales,”
By Cabo Tormentosso where the ghost of the
Waratah sails ;
By the Cape of Storms and Magellan—capes of
good hope and despair ;
Carl and Hans with their captains, old Dunder
and Plitzen, were there.
Down in the frozen silence, dose to the spinning
Pole ;
Sweltered in Indian forests where the Service has
never a soul.
Deep in the mighty Rockies—on the sands of the
carrion bird—
In the conquered McDonell Ranges is their
Broken English heard.
(Hark ! through our Civil Service, choked in a
dry despair,
The sound of Broken English is heard in high
places there,
Roundly denouncing “Humpug, ” stirring official
dirt,
Daring to say, for Australia, “more than his
pillit is wort ! ”)
Voices in Broken English ever defied the Fates —
Saving a State to the Union —saving the South to
the States.
Steel in his self-made duty, deaf to the world at
large—
Voice of a Foreign Father : “ Moof up, my poys,
und—Sharge ! ”
Foreign father and husband, foreign children and
wife,
Thoughts in a different language, and past in a
different life.
Pie cares not a jot for “ der shtory ” we “ pack-
worts to frontworts tell ” ;
We smile at his Broken English— but well go
zvith old Blitz to Hell!
Lights of the placid Liner, a mass of iron and
steel,
A little Norse on the look-out and a big Swede at
the wheel ;
A thousand lives and a palace, and a fortune in
merchandise
Depend on a pair of the mildest and bluest Nor-
wegian eyes.
Nuggety, fair and placid (he turns for three paces
thus) ;
But uneasy as that old sailor on the schooner
Hesperus.
(“ Light on the starport bow, sir !”) Pie thinks
of his native town
As she shifts a point—and he notes it. And the
smoky smother comes down.
Open boat from the liner, on the far-flung Shark
Reef hurled !
Laden with women and children, and manned
from all the world !
Swooping to sky and axis we with the glass
discern
A little Norwegian for’ard and a big Swede in the
stern.
Shoutings in Broken English to the driftwood fire
aglow,
Holding her back for “ der next vun ” —“ peach-

“ Now for the vomans and shildren ! Fully poys

Proud of the Broken English, and proud to
be a son
Of men who to vagabond British said “Do

Proud of the scrubby red beard, of the wiry

And proud of the tinted veining shown through a

The Bunmaker's Year.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE year 188- is remembered by the few
remaining Battlers of that period who still
patrol the five rivers in Western Queens-
land, as “The Bunmaker’s Year.” Since then
the Bunmaker himself has not been seen or heard
of on his old beat. Nobody has ever known his
second name, and it is not certain if he had
one. From scraps of his early history, coming
mainly from himself, it appears that he was born,
somehow, in Little Bourke-street, Melbourne, and
when he was about 12 years old was snapped up
by the police, and sent to a reformatory for five
years. He was sent to a station from there, and
in a year or two left his employment and took to
EVEN IN HEAVEN.
ST. PETER: “ Eh—where from?”
SHADE OF SECESHER : “ New South Wales.”
ST. PETER : “No hope. Victoria has secured all the available space.”
the “ track,” which he never left again. lie came
to Queensland, and became an identity on the
rivers. He was known as a lazy, good-natured,
easy-going rascal, who was not disliked by those
who knew him. He acquired his cognomen on
his first public appearance in Queensland. He
was up before the Bench in a town near the bor-
der, for vagrancy, and the local butcher, who
happened to be the only available J.P. that morn-
ing, asked him, “What is yeer occupation, me
man ? ”
Jimmy said, “ I am an ’ot-cross-bunmaker, yer
Wuship.”
“ Wha-a-at?”
“ An ’ot-cross-bunmaker.”
“ But that is only wan day in the year, me
man.”
“That’s the day T work, your Wuship,” said
Jimmy.
The Bench was very angry. It shook its finger
at Jimmy and said, “ I will give ’oo two hours to
lave the town. If’twasn’t that the lockup is full,
ye’d get tin days on the wood-hape. Go away
now, an’ don’t thrifle wid the lah agen. ”
He did himself an injustice, however. He
worked occasionally. At shearing time he would
take on light jobs, such as sweeping on the shear-
ing board or carrying away fleeces from the wool-
classer. Physically, he was a “weed,” and his
clothes seemed always to be too large for him.
Mentally, he was far from being bright. Yet he
managed to dodge along and get at least as much
as any other Battler. Like all of his profession,
Jimmy was always possessed of a few shillings.
His years of wandering had taught him that a time
came, even to the cleverest cadger, when all the
arts and wiles of battlerdom will not extract a
feed on a hungry track, and when it is ex-
tremely inconvenient to go hungry'. So he
was careful of the few pounds he earned
in the year. Thus, when one of the men
came to him once at a shed and said : “ Give us
’arf a jim, Bunny. Three of us is sendin’ fer
tickets in the big sweep,”
Jimmy said : “ Ten bpb ! Yous blokes must
think Pm a chump. It’s too ’ard ter get. Not
me.”
“ Yer'll be wild if we dror a big prize an’ go
down an’ live in clover all the rest of our life.”
Jimmy only shook his head emphatically.
Nevertheless, the idea of having enough money
to live without work appealed to Jimmy. He
thought over the matter for a week, and then
asked the woolclasser in a lull of the work : “ D’
yer know annythink about sweeps, boss ? ”
“ Yes ; why ? ”
“ I’m thinkin’ of tryin’ me luck. A bloke tole
me the other day that a man cud dror enough to
live wivout work if ’e was lucky.”
“Yes—if you draw the first prize.”
At “ smoko,” Jimmy went to the man who had
asked him to join in buying tickets, and, offering
the money, said, “’Ere y’are, bloke. I’ll’ave a
cut in wiv yer.”
“ You’re too late, Jimmy. The money was
sent last week.”
Jimmy went back to his boss and said, “ Will
yer send fer a ticket fer me, boss ?
’Ere’s the silver.”
The woolclasser sent willingly,
and in due course a ticket came
addressed to “ James Bun-
maker.” Two or three weeks
later Jimmy brought the result
slip, and said, “’Ere y'are,
boss. ’Ere’s the results. I
can’t make ’ead or tail of it.”
The woolclasser took the ticket and the slip,
and in a few minutes, after an excited comparison
of the two, said, “ Why, Jimmy, you’ve drawn a
big cash prize. Five hundred pounds ! ”
Jimmy said, “ Y’are on’y kiddin’, boss.”
“No. lam certain of it. lam glad. You’ll
get net.”
“ Go hon,” said Jimmy, with his mouth and
eyes open at their widest. “That’s a lot o’
beans. Wot will Ido with it all ? ”
“ Keep your mouth shut first, and then when
you get it put it away for a nest-egg, so that when
you leave the track you can live well till you die.”
“ I’ll think about it, boss. Thank yer.”
With the help of the woolclasser, later on
Jimmy found himself the possessor of ,£450 and a
cheque-book. He drew and, leaving the
balance in the local bank, went down to visit the
scenes of his youth in Little Bourke-street. He
only stayed away from the bush for a few weeks
and then came back, satisfied that the city was no
place for him. As he told a man he knew in the
township : “ I liked the steamer all right, Joe, but
of all the smotherin’, dirty ’oles in the world, Little
Bourke is the one. When I was a kinchin the
streets was wide an’ all the ’ouses twice as big,
an’ there was room fer a cove. Now yer can’t
move fer people a-shovin’ and a-tryin’ ter rob yer.
Couldn’ get a decent feed, ’ceptin’ at the corfee
stalls at night; an’ the cops was alius a-watchin’
of yer. When I ’eard that me ole mother ’ad
married a Chow, an’ there was a lot of Chows fer
brothers, I was properly full up. So I clears
back to the clean ole bush.”
“ What are yer goin’ ter do with yer gilt,
Jimmy ?”
“ Well, I’ve bin figgerin’ it out all the time, an’
I’m goin’ to a quiet pub on the track, where
there’s a good ’ole fer fishin’, an’ live like a
gennleman. S’posin’ I pay a quid a week fer me
tucker ; that’s fifty-two quid a year. Then
allowin’ ten bob a week fer close, an’ a drink er
two, that’s another twenty-six quid a year. ’Ow
much is that?”
“ Seventy-eight quid.”
“That’s what I makes it. Seventy-eight quid
inter four hundred quid goes five times and ten
quid over. I’m goin’ ter ’ave a bit of a ramble
now an’ agen, when it will cost me nothin’. So I
can put Matilda away for five solid years, an’ still
’ave a bit left fer the track at the last.”
“ Yer sensible, Jimmy. Wish I ’ad ’arf yer
brains. Kin yer lend us a couple er quid till
shearin’ ? ”
“My oath. Come to the bank an’ I’ll dror a
cheque.”
They went to the bank, and, as Jimmy was
preparing to laboriously draw the cheque for two
pounds, Joe said, “ Make it a five, Jimmy ; it’s
just as easy ter write a five as a two.” Joe got a
fiver, and was sorry that it wasn’t ten he had asked
for.
Jimmy chose Nolan’s pub on the river at Bool-
alla. Jimmy liked it because there was a big
waterhole which had never been known to go dry ;
and which was known to all travellers as being
the best fishing and camping place on the rivers.
So Jimmy took up his life as a country gentleman.
It was quickly known all over the country that
the Bunmaker had returned from his southern
trip and was to be found at “ The Royal Hotel,
kept by Joseph Nolan,” as the signboard had it ;
also that he was living on the interest of the very-
large sum he had won in the big sweep. Very
few knew how much it was, and, starting high,
the sum had gradually increased as the Bagman’s
Gazette passed it along, until it was spoken of
in thousands.
All Battlerdom girded up its loins, and from
every point of the compass made its way to see
Jimmy and rejoice with him. The first to arrive was
the Lost Cat, one of the most noted of the Battlers
in the West. When he threw his swag and
tucker-bags down at the corner of the verandah of
the pub, he seemed much surprised to see Jimmy
sitting on the long stool placed against the wall.
He said : “ Aha-a-a ! Is it me old friend Jimmy
I see ? Sure I never expected to meet him here
this day. Which way did ye come ? lamon me
way to Noo South, an’ in a hurry.”
“ I am stoppin’ ’ere fer a bit, Tommy,” said
Jimmy.
“No —never! Ye’ll have ter pay fer that.
Mary Nolan don’t keep star boarders at the R’yal
Oak. Or is it that ye arre chequed up be workin’
hard ? ”
“ I gotter pot o’ beans outer the sweep, blokes,”
said Jimmy, proudly. “ Come an’ ’ave a drink.”
There were several drinks, and then the Lost Cat
went down to the waterhole and rigged up what
he hoped would be winter quarters.
He came back towards evening, and found
that Double-Tooth Mick, Old Pushabout and
Grass-seed Alf had arrived, and were having
supper at Jimmy’s expense, and had probably
been drinking at his expense also, for the party
was very hilarious. After a jolly night, these
went down to the river and rigged permanent
quarters, too. Three others arrived next day,
and within io days all the choice spots on the
camping-ground within handy distance of the
pub were occupied by a collection of the hardest
cases in the West. All sorts of tales were told to
Jimmy, as each arrived and was hospitably re-
ceived, to account for their presence ; and Jimmy
knew what it meant to be rich. Pie was flat-
tered and deferred to, and every word which
came from him was listened to and applauded as
the utterance of a very wise man. Jimmy was in
the seventh heaven of delight; and after the
novelty had worn off, accepted the homage as his
rightful due. He was never quite drunk and
never quite sober, and at that period would not
have changed places with Tyson, as he often said.
A couple of weeks after Jimmy had taken up
his quarters at the Royal Oak, Mrs. Nolan said :
“ It’s a fine lot av men ye have for friends, Mister
Jimmy. They think the world av ye. .. . They
come ter me ter tucker, offerin’ ter swap fish for
it. I don’t mind ; but we can’t be always aitin’
fish, an’, as himself is a poor man, we can’t be
always givin’ away the bit out av the mouths av
the childer. They do be always askin’ me fer
things. ”
“ Give them what they want, Mrs. Nolan,”
said Jimmy grandly, “ an’ put it in ther bill.”
“That’s all very well, Misther Jimmy ; but I
don’t quite know what ye will be afther sayin’
whin the bill comes in. It might be too big fer
ye.”
“ Oh, there’s plenty o’ beans, Mrs. Nolan. I
started with five hundred quid, an’ I’ve on'y used
eight cheques outer me book of 100 ; so yer might
say it’s ’ardly touched yet.”
Mrs. Nolan was disappointed that it wasn’t as
large a sum as she had heard ; but a rapid mental
calculation showed her that there was plenty to
come and go upon for awhile. She said : “ Shure.
I wasn’t doubtin’ ye. I was on’y wondherin’ if ye
would be givin’ a bit out av yeer forchin to the
poor fellies.”
“ Give ’em tucker, Mrs. Nolan. I was a Bat-
tler meself, and know what it means to be ’ungry,”
said Jimmy, with a wave of his hand.
The Battlers’ camp, too, was discussing Jimmy,
and wondering how much he had. The lowest
estimate was ;£3°°o, and the Lost Cat summed up
the feelings of Battlerdom when he said at the end
of the discussion : “Well, I don’t know what he
has, but he’ll be soft pickin’, if he isn’t spiled.
He ought to put us over the winter easily. He is
a godsend, anyhow. But—we will have to take
steps. There’s too many av us do be goin’ up at
once. True it is that he has poor judgment an’
no head for figgers, an’ takes too much drink ;
but if he is charged be a mob ivery time he shows
his nose out av his room, he’ll take a tumble.
How many av us is on the spot ? ”
A muster was called, and it was found that
there were 26 genuine bagmen and four strangers
who were waiting for work in the vicinity. These
were warned off forthwith, and went willingly, for
the anger of 26 of the greatest scoundrels in the
West was a formidable thing to brave. Then the
Battlers divided themselves into six squads of
four each, while Double-Tooth and the Lost Cat
had the privilege of going when they thought best.
The squads had their appointed day to visit the
pub, and each of the men an appointed time in
the day. After that, things appeared to go
much more smoothly, although the drain on
Jimmy’s money was the more deadly because it
was not so apparent. He kept no record of his
spendings, and it was so easy to pay Mrs. Nolan
with a cheque that it did not seem like giving
good money.
Of course, the tale of the Battlers’ camp be-
came generally known all over the West, and
many came out of curiosity, expecting to see a


roaring spree, with Jimmy for the lamb. They
were disappointed. Twenty-six experienced
Battlers knew too much for that. The visitors
saw never more than two or three elderly quiet
men having a drink or a feed with Jimmy. If the
signs of overspending had been plainer Jimmy
would have been warned, and might have got
away with something.
The hawkers heard of the camp, and Ghuzel
Deen, Afghan, brought his cart over, to the
annoyance of all concerned but Jimmy. Jimmy
bought in a princely way—flash jewellery, silk
handkerchiefs, gaudy dress stuffs, expensive pipes,
and so on. The Lost Cat came up as soon as he
heard of the matter, and thinking it unwise to
remonstrate with Jimmy, went to Ghuzel Deen
and said : “Look here, Ghuzel. Ye are robbin’
me mate, an’ have done well so far. Ye’d better
be movin’ on at once if not sooner. If ye don’t
. ” He nodded his head grimly.
Ghuzel was offended and hurt. He said:
“What for-r you say me r-rob your mate?
Ever-r-rything on my car-r-rt he cheap, ver-r-ry
cheap. Cheap boot, cheap hat, cheap silkety
stripety cr-r-rimea shir-rt ; cheap pipe an’
cigar-r-rett. What for-r me go ’way ? No mister.
Me no go ’way.”
Next day he learned that his best horse was
hopelessly bogged in a part of the river where no
horse would be fool enough to go if not compelled.
He knew, and harnessing up with his remaining
horses, he went off cursing.
The Lost Cat said that night at the camp :
“ Ghuzel Deen dhrew nearly a hundred quid
frum that chump av a Bunmaker to-day. I saw
the cheque. The Nolans is togged out for the
next twelve mont’s, an’ there’s the Bunmaker
himself standin’ on the verandy this blessed minnit
dhressed in white silk pejammies, smokin’ a pipe
which cost him two quid, and ye’d think he was
a station manager givin’ orders in the mornin’ to
the min before he’s had brekfus. An’ here’s the
winter not started. It med me cry ter see him.”
Ghuzel Deen was not the only hawker either.
None of the others got much though. The Lost
Cat saw to that. Still the money w*ent pretty
steadily, and one day it struck Mrs. Nolan that it
would be well if she could get precise figures as to
how much there was left. She waited till Jimmy
went out, and then taking the cheque-book she
totted up the amounts in the butts and found that
when her boarder had paid her some outstanding
accounts there would be left a balance of
supposing that Jimmy’s estimate of his prize as
being was correct. (Which it wasn’t, for
Jimmy had quite forgotten Tattersall’s commis-
sion. ) The margin seemed too narrow and she
determined to pass Jimmy and his cheque-book
on at once.
The Lost Cat came in just then for flour, tea
and tobacco. She said briefly, “Ye can’t have
it. Aren’t ye ashamed to be robbin’ the poor
man ? Me an’ Joe’s med up our minds ter shtop
it.”
The Lost Cat knew too well that there was
an end to the money when he heard this, for
Mrs. Nolan had never been known to let go six-
pence if she knew it was there.
“ It’s sorry I am that ye should think so.
Come now, Mrs. Nolan,” he said in a whisper,
“is it really all gone? ”
“ I don’t know what you mane,” she replied.
“ I mean this,” he said. “ When Double-tooth
was here a little while ago, ye gave him tucker
and drink. Now, ye haven’t stopped supplies at
a minnit’s notice for naw'thin’. Tell me now ? ”
She reflected, and came to the conclusion that
it would help her to have the news spread.
“There’s not twinty quid left.”
The Lost Cat didn’t lose any time in talk. As

JOHNNY (philosophising): “Some people are born for one thing, and some for another.”
SHE : “I suppose you’re the thing I was born for!”
became a great Battler, he was quick in action
and full of resource. He sought Jimmy, and said :
“Jimmy, I have come to say good-bye, an’ thank
ye for the hospitality ye have given me. An’ if
ye will extend it so as to lend me ten pounds on
me note ov hand for three mont’s I’ll call down
the blessin’s of Heaven upon yer head, an’ pray
that ye’ll continoo to be healt’y, wealt’y an’ wise
for ever an’ ever. Amen.”
Jimmy was much affected, and immediately
went in and drew a cheque for £lO. The Lost
Cat thanked him nicely and said : “Itis ye that
has always paid for the dhrink. Come an’ have
wan wid the Losht Cat.”
They went to the bar and had the drinks, and
then took an affecting leave of each other.
The Lost Cat went straight down to his camp,
and in a few minutes was surrounded by a crowd
of men, all curious to see him pulling down his
tent and rolling up his swag. On inquiry he said :
“ I am leavin’ becos supplies is stopped.” He
finished quickly, and was soon on his way to the
township, fearing that if he lost too much time his
cheque would be valueless.
The information came as a bombshell to the
others, and a few minutes later they were stream-
ing up to the pub to see into the matter.
They found Jimmy, and Double-tooth said:
“ What made you stop the tucker, Jimmy ?”
“Never done no sich thing,” said Jimmy.
“ I’ll go an’ see the missus.” They went over to
the bar first, and Jimmy said, “ We’ll have
drinks, boys.”
Mrs. Nolan said, “Indeed, ye won’t. I’ll not
shtand by an’ see ye robbed anny longer. Ye’ll
get nayther dhrink nor tucker from the Royal
Oak. I’m full up av the crowd av ye. The house
is gettin’ a bad name.”
“ Don’t you git paid for it ?” asked Jimmy.
“ Oh, yis. I have seen to that ; but me an’
Joe’s tired av havin’ a crowd like ye min bangin’
round. Pay me what ye owe, an’ go away wid
them an’ be happy somewhere else.”
Double-tooth said, “Pay her, Jimmy, an’let
her go to the Divil. ”
“ How much is it, Mrs. Nolan ? ” said Jimmy,
pulling out the sadly-depleted cheque book.
“ 6s. 8d.,” said Mrs. Nolan, promptly.
“ But I’ll bate ye the odd six quid because ye
have bin a good customer. ”
Jimmy wrote out the cheque, and, including in
it the price of drinks for the crowd which Mrs.
Nolan was pleased to allow them to have, he
handed over the document. After that Jimmy
and his goods were escorted to the camp. Poor
“Matilda” looked very shabby amongst the
gaudy rugs and silk things which Jimmy had
collected during the past six weeks ; but at the
suggestion of one of the men that he should leave
it behind, Jimmy said, “ No. . . I have had her
fer 15 years, an’ I hain’t agoin’ ter part with
her now.”
When it was found that Mrs. Nolan adhered
firmly to her resolution of not supplying drink or
tucker to anybody in the camp for love or money,
the Battlers were in a quandary. They became
very abusive to her, but the appearance of two
mounted police at the hotel stopped all hostile
demonstrations. They held a meeting, at which
Jimmy was not present, to discuss the matter.
The conclusions come to were : (1) They would
have to shift ; (2) It would be absurd for such a
number to travel about in a body with Jimmy ;
(3) If they left Jimmy, he would get into other
hands and be lost to them. They had a deep
sense of injury in that Jimmy had led them to
believe that they were to be fed and cherished
for the whole winter, whereas the July fogs were
not yet over, and they were turning out into a
cold world. '
The conclusion of tbe whole matter was, that
Jimmy should pay them. They decided that
apiece would be a decent thing to ask. They
placed their views before Jimmy, and had little
difficulty in getting him to see from their point of
view. So he wrote out 25 cheques for each,
and Jimmy found when the last man was paid,
that there was no cheque left for himself. He
knew then that he was once more Jimmy the Bun-
maker.
They all departed, and Jimmy went up to the
pub to barter away the trash with which he was
burdened. He told Mrs. Nolan of the terms of
settlement with the crowd, and she laughed till she
cried. She said, “Ye silly chump, all yeer money
was gone whin I stopped the tucker. Ivry cheque
ye have written sence is on’y paper. Those blag-
gards will be seekin’ yer life. Here’s a quid. Git
away as quick as ye can. ”
He went, and has not been seen since on his
old beat. Mrs. Nolan’s last cheque was returned
too, marked N.S.F.

And when their hour was sounded they calmly
said “good-bye,”
And died upon the old, old steamer roads.
Some eighty years ago or less there were no coast-
wise lights.
Oh, for the little ships at sea !
And neither were there steamers to go out on
dirty nights
And look for the light that flashes “three.”
And then somewhere on Sydney side they built
the small Surprise.
Oh, stay the rushing thunder of the keels !
And William Fourth (old Billy) came to open
people’s eyes—
They’d wooden hulls and wondrous wooden
wheels.
Near eighty years ago it is since these queer things
of steam
Set out to plough the roads upon the main.
And softly, out from England, like a spinster in a
dream,
Was brought the pretty ship Sophia Jane.
And so began the steamboat lines that lift their
blazing stars
From Booby to Cape Borda in the Bight—
The steamer lines that ring our coasts and dare
the river bars
When earth and sea and sky are lost in night.
Their widespread paddles thrashed the sea, and
from the furnace-door
Red glare of flames flared upward through the
smoke,
Till blackfellows that saw the light and heard the
paddles roar
Cried out that ’twas the Evil One that spoke.
Year after year new steamers came, weird vessels
hugely sparred—-
The James Walt and the Sovereign were the best.
They pounded up and down the coast and pounded
good and hard,
Until at last they sank to well-earned rest.
Oh, when you pace the liner’s deck beside the
bright saloon
(The South Head light is fading far astern),
Remember that on this same road beneath the
same old moon
The old-time screws and paddles used to churn.
The gentle Ann steamed over first—Sydney to
Nelson town.
The wind that blows sang in her rigging then.
And soon the fast mail packets ran their merry
easting down,
And turned them round and picked it up again.
The William Denny, Auckland-bound, Lord Ash
ley running mails,
The Airedale and Lord Worsley eating coal—
The good crews fought the battle with the bitter
south-east gales,
And brought their steamers through it sound
and whole.
There are names you must remember —the Lady-
bird, the Queen,
The Boomerang and Clarence, on the coast.
The new and fast Aldinga, the Balclutha, the
Colleen,
The Queensland, that was one-time Brisbane’s
boast.
The Stormbird and the Wonga Wonga—hear
them drumming by,
Their ghosts are out upon the seas to-night.
The Shamrock and the Thistle and the Rose ;
they had to die—
Side-wheelers fighting out past Wilson’s Light;
The old steam packets made the roads we travel
on to-day,
The Blackall running' north with Queensland
mails—
And where we soar above the fret of all the
swirling spray
We know they took it swimming o’er their rails.
Oh, rolling bulwarks-under off the Balaclava
Light.
Ho, for the little ships at sea !
Ploughing past Cape Otway on a dirty, squally
night,
Watching for the light that flashes “three.”
We’re tramping round Australia as our fathers
tramped before,
And out across the ocean with the mail.
We hear the tempest’s anger and the breakers on
the shore,
And we half-expect to hear the old ships’ hail,
That travelled on the same old road beneath the
same old moon,
A-plunging with their cruel, heavy loads.
But they’re all dead and gone ; and, maybe, we’ll
be going soon
Away from the old, old steamer roads.

Love Song
(For The Bulletin.)
LOVE, wert thou a Tui,
Were I a Kowhai-tree,
By daylight or by darkness
What gladness life would be!
The wind might sweep the tussock
Afar upon the hill;
But we would rest on the valley’s
breast,
So wondrous warm and still
O Tui, forest -rover,
With rapture all day long
Thy shining wings would hover
My tender leaves among.
Above thee and below thee
My buds would all unfold,
And unabashed I’d show thee
My inmost heart of gold.
By night my drooping tresses
Would shelter thee, my Love*
The Bush would breathe caresses,,
The stars would watch above.
The wakeful sea would sing us
Unending lullaby—
O Love, wert thou a Tui,
Were I a Kowhai-tree!

When the Sleeper Wakes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THOUGH the house sleeps, the wind hesi-
tatingly rattles the shutters,
And moans in the throat of the chimney,
and whines at the door ;
And against the wet pane of the window a leaf
agitatedly flutters,
Intent on divulging a secret, with breathless
disclosures in store.
Then the -.noth-muffled flame of the candle is
suddenly snuffed, and, congealing,
Thf grease clots relentless as gyves on the
manacled wings,
And t image that struggle with
death, and grope most
stealthily, feeling
Tne knuckles of doom at my
throat, till a gasp breaks the
tension of things—
And the muscles grow lax, and the
heart, with its sledge-hammer
throbbing,
Pumps blood to the eyeballs that
stare upon purple and black,
Like the venomous vapors of wine,
at a witches’ hob-nobbing,
And the ghost of the brown moth
that died in the dark as a
dragon comes back.
His eyes are ablaze with the wrath
of a mad malediction ;
The spines of his back are as scimitars
twisted awry ;
His claws and his fangs are the nails of
a dread crucifixion,
Wherewith I am pinned like a moth
to the wall of the thundering sky.
The Cross is a crackle of thorns ; Orion
is baited by Sirius ;
And I, in the starry inferno, hang pendulous,
waiting to fall ;
The drone of the universe drowns the voice of the
victim delirious
That shall sweep like a comet through space,
with never a stoppage at all.
The vast is a booming of bells that peal in a pal-
pitant paean,
And clang in a clamorous chorus, with shiver-
ing, shudder and shock ;
The heavens are battering brass —of brass is the
mad empyrean
That echoes the stricken alarm that I set for

KETTLEDRUM.
The Scarlet Runner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HE (the Eligible) was taken up into a high
mountain to be tempted. It was easy
enough. There was a railway all the way
up and a good hotel at the top, with scenery and
solitude thrown in.
If there was anything in a man, these things,
she thought, would fetch it out.
But she reckoned too easily. The tricks and
habits of the unmarrying man are as a coat of mail.
They become worked up into the skin and bones
as part of the system, and cannot be lightly
thrown off or lost.
Time passed enjoyably. She made a fine
picture in this mountain setting, and there it
ended, in delightful dilly-dallying.
It made every fibre in her lithe body tingle
with resentment, as they stood together in the
gloaming looking over the country. This was
only the shell of a man—a bit of good grooming.
She would dearly like to see how a thing like
this would behave in a crisis. But only a miracle
would pierce that armor-plating of reserve.
And she got a miracle. A meteor whizzed
over their heads. It was no ordinary meteor, but
something altogether out of human ken. It was
a hissing, seething ball of red fire, looking as big
as a house, and it passed quite close to them.
Only an instant was spent in its coming and
going, but that instant was the shock of a life-
time. The thing left in its wake a smell of hot
metal and a singing in the ears.
And the little minx missed the spectacle of the
effect that the miracle had on the man, for she
swooned off into his arms. She never saw his
white face as he staggered under her weight and*
craned his neck looking into the void where the
thing had disappeared. She never even knew
till afterwards that he had carried her down td
the hotel.
Theirs was only a type of the incidents of that
night, for it was a night of meteors. People all
round the world wished for day to come, and
cried for more light.
The day brought little comfort to some. The
big city of New York went into mourning.
One of the horrors had ploughed a lane through
jts skyscrapers and church spires, leaving death
and ruin behind. Some buildings came down
and overwhelmed the crowded streets below.
Some had a hole punched through, where the
thing had gone in at one side and out at the other.
Some had their sides shot away, and hung over,
held up by their steel frames. Some were de-
molished an hour afterwards by another meteor,
which followed in the same track. People at
first thought it must be some devilish bombard-
ment from the harbor ; but the meteors were not
confined to New York or to that night, but con-
tinued shooting on in the daytime and in different
parts of the world.
Soon, however, the visitation seemed to have
done its worst, and could be sized up. It was
not the end of the world, after all. England had
seen nothing of it, nor Australia. But all round
the world in a line with the Mediterranean, lower
Asia, Polynesia and North America the horrors
had been continuous, and they were shooting yet !
And all in the same identical track, everyone in
New York for instance still going through that
lane that had been cleared by the first. Then it
turned out that they were not so numerous as had
been supposed. Eighteen or 20 were counted
over a given spot in 24 hours.
There were so many scientists considering the
question all over the world that the solution was
easy. It was only a matter of doing a sum based
on the time and the rate of speed to prove that
there was only one horror all the while —that it
A PARADOX.
THE MISSUS : “ For goodness sake, John, do
cheer up. You never seem to be happy
unless you're miserable!"
was the same thing going round and round the
earth every ihr. 23mm.
In fact, the earth had acquired another satellite
from somewhere.
An official description put it down as a mineral
mass, from 20ft. to 30ft. wide, with a speed
amounting to six odd miles a second. It travelled
in a westerly direction, and shone by reflected
light and also by a redness of its own due to
velocity.
Every newspaper printed a map of the world
showing the new satellite’s track over China,
Arabia,' America, etc., with its time of arrival and
departure at various points, just as if it were one
of Johnson’s trains. So people got used to it,
and it was a sort of time ball ; and as it kept just
going on, no higher and no lower, and doing no
more damage, familiarity bred contempt, and
jokes appeared about it in the comic papers.
Long before that, some of cffhe heathens in
Asia and such-like places had set up a worship
of it, and so it started in business as a god.
It was known as the Scarlet Runner in compli-
ment to its color and its speed. It became a
show along its route. People went long distances
to get a view of it.
The stricken city cleared away its ruins, and
Satellite Avenue was built, with vast hotels and
towering terraces on either side. It was an
avenue of avenues —a place to go to if you wanted
a sensation, for the thing rushed up it (harmlessly
THE HEATHEN IN TITS BLINDNESS.
The new missionary's wife was hying to ingratiate herself among her husband's parishioners.
“ Are you fond of children?" she asked of the Chief Muck-a-Muck, a pillar of the mission.
"Well, so-so," answered the Muck-a-Muck, with a blast smile; “they are not bad with cocoa-
nut gravy for a change; but as a steady diet give me the roast missionary of Old England!"
now) at close quarters every hour and 23 minutes.
Why it came so close to the earth there and
skipped some of the high mountain peaks else-
where was a matter ordinary people couldn’t
settle. The question involved the shapes and
causes of orbits, the situation of the earth’s “ true
centre,” and all that kind of thing, vastly enter-
taining to scientific folk, but drier than a bun-fight
to plain man.
On the whole, the Scarlet Runner was set
down as a meteor caught by the earth on a tan-
gent, and for want of other explanation the sub-
ject was let go at that. And people went on with
their work.
Ephraim Moss was one of the people —a young
fellow quietly working his daily round in a
Government office in Bombay. He was easy-
going and plodding, with a scientific bent, not
too much of a good fellow, not over-popular, and
a bit of a butt sometimes. What concerns us is
that he did not believe the Scarlet Runner was a
meteor, come here from outside. We have to do
with a holiday he took by rail through Delhi to
Panasawar with an Indian or two of his acquaint-
ance. They were going shooting, and had their
guns ; but it is not much shooting that they did,
or went to do. After the train they rode to
Chamtokh, the iron-smelting country that had
been peopled and run by the late Yankee, Jepps,
who used to have an observatory in the Hima-
layas. The observatory, since his disappearance,
had become overgrown and solitary.
At a certain point Moss and his party discarded
their horses and commenced a journey up steep
slopes in country devoid of horse, elephant, camel,
bullock or other means of conveyance. Palms
and bamboos gave way to pines, and the India
that baked was left behind and below.
For Moss was a Hebrew bulldog, and, acting on
information he had picked up officially, he was
on the track of the why and the wherefore of the
Scarlet Runner.
Three days he and his followers went on their
lonely way. Then suddenly, in a gorge, they
came oh a strange thing—something that looked
in the distance like a ship's funnel upended at the
bottom of a ravine.
It was plain tq see that it had tumbled, some
time or other, headlong down .the 2000 ft. of
precipice above. As they approached it grew
vast —vaster than the Vendome Column that was
hurled down in Paris by the Commune. At close
quarters it revealed itself definitely as a monster
cannon constructed of numberless steel bands,
cumulative plates of steel bolted and welded over
one another —a cannon with the proportions of an
ocean liner. Its lower end was driven ioft. or
so into the ground by reason of its fall. A strange
echo must have thundered among those rocks when
that mass rolled down.
Ephraim Moss went half off his head w.ith
delight, and he fooled about that evening looking
at his chronometer and gazing up into the sky
every hour and 23 minutes to see the Scarlet
Runner go by.
Then Moss put his assistants and himself hard
at work examining and measuring the big iron
structure in the gorge. Pukar, his servant, took
a dozen photographs of it, some of them long
exposures showing rema.rkable details of its
interior construction ; and in all his view's Moss
was cunning enough to introduce human figures,
himself among them, to show the colossal pro-
portions of the thing.
Then they fled back to Bombay as they came,
and in a fortnight Moss was on a steamer going
across the Arabian Sea, with a great notion of
interviewing a certain official scientist. He had
got six months’ leave for the purpose.
The official scientist proved a chatty, unpre-
tentious cut of fellow when Moss got at him.
“ You w r ant to see me about the Runner ! ” he
said as soon as the visitor presented his card.
■ “ Who told you that ? ”
“ Oh, I can always tell them,” said the scientist,
grinning. “ Fifty per cent, of our visitors are
about the Runner. Is it the Projectile Theory? ”
Moss nodded. He was scarcely surprised.
The projectile theory was not his alone, by any
means.
“ Well, of course we want facts ; and only
facts are any good. The theories are all thread-
bare—ail right as theories, but, in this case,
wanting proof. Of course, a ball fired with a
speed of five or more miles a second at the
cannon’s mouth will overcome the earth’s gravity
and continue to go round the world indefinitely.
That is all right as theory, but show me that
gun ! ”
Then Moss began. “In April 19 —, Jepps”
“ Tepps ! The iron king and amateur astrono-
mer ! I knew him personally. They said he
was loony, but he was no more mad than I
am ! ”
“ His company made the viaduct over the
Oudar extension on ”
“ Yes—circular tubes 300 ft. long. He took
one of the same pattern up the mountain for his
mammoth equatorial telescope. Here’s a photo-
graph of it.”
The scientist took the photograph out of a
drawer and handed it to Moss, who almost
clutched at it !
It was a picture of one of the bridge tubes
plain enough, and nothing else, strapped up for
its difficult and costly transport. The view was
taken at the works at Chamtokh.
“ By-the-bye, they think Jepps was murdered
all right. I hear to-day they have made an
arrest.”
But Moss was busy scanning the photograph,
and did not take in the remark. Under the pic-
ture was pencilled, “Tube for the Mammoth
Equatorial, Jepps Observatory.”
Moss took his pencil from his pocket and
crossed this out and wrote something else over it,
after which he handed it back.
“Ah, now we talk ! Open your bag. Open
your bag ! ” for the official scientist could be as
excited as any ordinary person at times. So Moss
opened his bag and spread out his tricks —his
photographs and plans and measurements. The
scientist seized on them like a cat on its prey. He
darted from one to another in restless excitement,
and was helped out by Moss with a point
or two now and then. When at last he sat
back in his chair and wiped his eyeglasses, he
looked at Moss and told him he had done his
work very well. Moss waited for more.
“O, it’s the thing right enough ! The tube
was used as a skeleton, to build the gun around.
The telescope idea was only a blind. ”
The suspect who was charged with the murder
of Pluto Jepps was one of Jepps’ workmen.
There were about 20 of them wanted and adver-
tised for, but the other 19 were apparently keep-
ing out of the way. The prisoner admitted his
identity but not his guilt, declaring that Jepps had
been killed by accident. He reserved his defence
and his explanations. The general impression
was that he and the rest had made away with the
millionaire somewhere in the mountains, with
robbery as the probable motive.
The prisoner, Mackintosh, was a sturdy, heavy-
looking man of the working class, a riveter by
trade. He only looked up in a dull, ordinary way
when Moss and the official scientist and a police in-
spector entered his cell. He had been inter-
viewed a good deal and was tired of it. Moss
started off talking, and after that the prisoner was
no longer listless.
“ It w'as a gun that killed Jepps ! ” said Moss
quietly.
“ A gun ? ”
“ A gun —a big gun ! ”
“ A big gun ! ”
“Avery big gun ! A gun with a bore fl2ft.
wide —as wide as the tube of the Oudar railway
bridge—wide enough to hold two sets of rails. It
was the gun that fired the Scarlet Runner, and it
was only fired once. It didn’t burst, but it un-
shipped with the concussion, and killed Jepps !’’
“ And nineteen more ! ”
Moss had entranced the man, and he seemed
only too anxious now to help him out.
“ Nineteen more ? ”
“Nineteen! It rolled over them and flat-
tened them out like pancakes ! We were all on
that side. I was at the end, but I got some-
thing ! ”
He showed an ugly healed scar on his leg.
“ Bolt-head. It grazed me as I jumped ! "’
“When the gun went down the gorge?”
The man looked hard.
“How doyou know?”
“ Because the gun’s been found, and we ve
guessed a good deal. What was Jepps’ object?”
“We never knew. I don't know now ! We
were paid to ask no questions, and paid well. I
don’t believe he ever told a living soul. All we
knew was it was a gun. He was always straight
with us and we with him. Rest all their souls ! "
“ Where was the rifling done ?”
“ Chantokh ! It was taken up in sections.
We had 80 men working on the hill at one time,
but few of them were in the know. The tube was
reinforced to Bft. thick at one end.”
Mackintosh’s pride in the job was beginning to
revive and animate him.
“And the projectile?” asked Moss.
“Chrome nickel steel, bolted fore and aft ! ”
“ Um, a nickel steel moon ! ” said the official
scientist.
There is now no doubt held about the motive
of Jepps. His fancy had been caught by the
well-known calculated formula in the astronomical
text books, that, if a cannon-ball be fired at a cer-
tain rate, its impetus will overcome the earth’s
gravity and it will go round the world indefinitely.
It was just the idea that a multi-millionaire of that
stamp would take on. As for the deception about
a big telescope, it was a mere blind to cover the
real work. A man who proposes adding a new
planet to the solar system requires to lie low.
So Jepps’ monument is the Scarlet Runner, and
its Champs-Elysees are the Highways of Grand
Hotels. New York keeps the toll gate, having
paid dearly for it ; and now wealth, fashion and
gaiety disport on the terraces of Satellite Avenue
of a summer evening. Down below in the Trough
is everything—dancing, singing, drinking, buying,
selling and all the rest. The street prophet is
there, for the whole thing is the world’s shocking
example. “Wot ’as man done? Usurped the
functions of jhe Orlmighty and created a’Eavenly
body and committed the unpardonable sin,” says
the street prophet. ■ "vv
Suddenly out go the lights, all except the Arc
Illumination of the Runner’s path. Every sound
is hushed and every eye and ear strained, and the
nickel steel moon that once dyed this same road
with hlood is a huge, hissing, roaring mass in front
of the summer girl for just one-26,000th part of
a second. It is expectation, reality and a memory,
all in a moment.
Up go the lights again, the hiss of the satellite
still singing in everybody’s ears, and on goes
Vanity Fair, and freshly warns the Preacher.
Now and then, on the terraces, shrouded by
the large-leaved pot-plants, a lover will swear to
himself that the thing should have come just at
that moment. We pity him too. How can the
thread of a discourse of passionate love be re-
sumed where it was left off when once it is broken,
in upon by a thing like that ? “ Let as go in and
dance now, Fred,” says the half-proposed-to girl.

Drums of Dreams.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
NOW I lay among the bushes watching
heamsters coming down ;
(How the road-racked waggons, shriek-
ing, plunged and swayed !)
So I fell a-dream of poets and their loses over-
blows,
Of their faithful women dreaming and dis-
mayed.
I fell a-dream of poets, crested knights and
kings and slaves,
Of worn-out warriors dying in regrets —-
Till, sounding like hoarse thunder through the
even fall of waves,
Past my refuge went the Drums of the Cadets.
Drums, oh, drums that have drummed us from
the troubled
Dusk of tvoe lit by fires of martyrdom,
Dead hearts rose from their beds of sloth and
doubled
Onward, onward, to the wild, ecstatic drum.
I fell a-dream of drums of peace and restless drums
of war,
Fairy drums of children singing from the blue,
Of drums inspiring Heroes from beyond the
farthest star,
Whose utterance warms wild men to dream
and do.
Of drums that brook no tarrying. It’s leave your
home and march
Where warring fate on fate is warring hurled ;
That rip the clouds of destiny and through the
Golden Arch
Bring seared battalions to a newer world.
The evening mist was cannon smoke and hordes
of ghostly men
Made each bright blade of grass a gleaming
sword ;
Their savage shriek of freedom flared along the
creek again,
And old systems fell to ashes at the word.
Winds of war and rushing squadrons swept across
the dusky flat,
Gleamed red the silent place with flaming eyes,
Where silver-mailed commanders on their milk-
white chargers sat,
And deployed their pallid columns up the rise.
Drums, oh, drums that have played the nations
onward,
Brought new life for the sluggard and the slave;
Dreams of dreamers for ever floating van-ward
Draw their calm from the drums that kept us
brave !
The drums of revolution set all smouldering hopes
a-fire,
And flames of union weld all swords in one ;
The formless dreams of peoples fasten on a fixed
desi re,
And the singing armies march into the sun.
Across embattled centuries the wave of progress
comes
(Lo ! all the twilight fairies lean and hark !),
Since murder rang the tocsin, and the tocsin
called the drums,
And the drummers brought the people from the
dark.
Drums, oh drums, from the magic of your thunder
Came all leisure and the dreanis we dream to-
day !
Dreams, oh dreams, all your tenderness and
wonder
Hold their might from the drums that dreamed
the way !
Among the hills of twilight, moving in the crying
waves,
Go the plumed warriors in ghostly rout ;
And the voices of disaster sobbing from old prison
caves
Merge with music of old drums that drummed
us out.
Though low among the rushes sound the mystic
drums of death,
No doubt restrains the drums that beat ahead,
They call to front, and springs the laziest cutlass
from its sheath
And cannons blaze for hope across the dead.
Though softer than a whisper be the murmur of
the drums,
Though louder than the thunder of a gale,
When through the cloud of ignorance the call ol
battle comes
The serried troops they muster never fail.
Drums, oh drums, 1 have heai'd your mane
calling
Loud long years and I answer with a shottt,
Drums, oh drums, of your rising thrones and
falling,
Old-time troubles and the drums that drummed
us out.

FURNLEY MADRICE.
A Pleasant Balcony.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
IT is set in a pleasant, sunny corner, in an angle
formed by the two wings of a very solid-look-
ing three-storeyed building of an old and his-
torical style. The three rows of windows of the
main building are old-fashioned. They differ
from other windows in old-fashioned buildings of
the type, being set horizontally instead of verti-
cally, and being somewhat narrower and shorter
than is usual. In common with all windows
of the old style of keep, fortress or prison (or all
three combined), they are strongly barred. The
balcony itself is some 10ft. or 12ft. from the ground.
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT.
BROWN (who has been asleep , wakes up to a new “turn”): “Gimme the glasses!
Gimme the glasses!!”
The floor is supported by a beam stretching across
from wall to wall, the ends being let into the stone-
work. The roof, some 7ft- or Bft. above, is sup-
ported by a similar beam, and runs up to the
main walls ; it is of common corrugated iron and is
lined underneath with ordinary ceiling half-inch
matchboards. The floor of the balcony would
cover about the space of a fair-sized double-
fronted cottage room ; and it would be triangular
but for the fact that a corner of the main build-
ing has been blunted off, or cut across, to admit
of doors leading out on to the balcony and on to
the basement below, and windows opening into
the great iron staircase well above. The front
plates of the balcony are finished with moulding
and bevelled slips, and the roof is furnished with
guttering and a down pipe, as in an ordinary cot-
tage ; but the open front is different. It is crossed
with three vertical tubular bars and one horizontal
bar. They are about two inches in diameter, like
big, black gas-pipes, and the whole is covered
with strong wire-netting.
The affair suggested to me, at first, a big
bird-cage built, say, for a reserved and solitary
bird of the crane species. Then it seemed to

they met in the surf.
convey a hint of a place for unruly or mischievous
children to play in, without danger of their push-
ing each other over or falling out. I didn't think
of it as a fitting place for monkeys—or apes—
until later on. The bird-cage idea was helped
by a glimpse of a roost, shadowy and retiring,
seen just in under the eaves when the place was
viewed from the garden below. This roost ran
across just about over, the centre of the balcony.
It was of very stout timber—say 6in. or 9m. by 3m.
or 4in. I had no opportunity to take measure-
ments. Say a perch for great carrion birds of sullen,
baleful and repulsive appearance, something like
those that are—or used to be—kept near the top
of the Botanic Gardens. I believe there were a
few birds in this cage at different times, but they
were never gay. The last bird of any note that
roosted there was a very uncommunicative and
unsociable old fowl with a broken or damaged
beak. He disappeared some years ago. It is
said that in earlier life he drove a cab —if you can
imagine a bird driving a cab.
Then the thing suggested to me a hot weather
sleeping place for consumptive patients with a
tendency towards somnambulism or a liablility to
take sudden fancies and to climb on high places and
wander in space. The more so that this was, and
had been for many years, a Government institution,
and there were many patients there. I was told
that there had been numerous patients on that
balcony, but was assured that the nurse never, in
any case, or under any pretext whatsoever, left a
patient until the end—not, indeed, for some time
after it. It was strictly against the rules to do so.
It was a strange, unreal but lovely morning
when I, by courtesy of the superintendent of the
institution, stepped out through the dark-green
door in the corner and on to that balcony. It
was just nine o’clock, the usual time when carefully-
selected patients are admitted to the balcony.
The balcony faces the east. It was in early
winter. The sun, in a soft silvery haze, was more
like an over-polished brass moon, warm with
friction, than its usual self; the sky was crossed
with a hard mail of steely clouds with a hint of
moonlight at the edges and round the breaks,
where the very dark blue, though hard, seemed
fathomless—like the blue seen on some rare
moonlight nights. It was a sort of moonlit sky
in the morning. Then it flashed up and narrowed
from the outer edges of the cloud belt with a
coming and vanishing hint of all colors —including
dyed leathers in ladies’ hats. But I couldn't
help thinking of the thoughts of the last man who
stood where I stood then. I’ll tell you about him
later on.
But one morning, before this, and at the time I
am writing about now, I happened to look up to
the floor of the balcony, and a light dawned, or
rather a darkness and strange sort of sadness
fell upon me. The floor is supported by a frame-
work of joists, not at all massive, and very neatly
put together, and not ceiled. In the centre is a
trap-door, in two halves, evidently intended to be
reached by a step-ladder placed on the basement
underneath. The door might be 6ft. by 3ft. or
4ft. As I said before, I had then no opportunity
of taking exact measurements, no matter how
greatly interested in this quaint and sunny little
balcony I may have been. And, strange to say,
the last man chiefly interested, who by his
talents and training might have taken almost
exact measurements with the eye alone (he had no
two-foot rule nor had he time to use it, for he
had an appointment to keep)—the last man, I
say, died before he had leisure to furnish any esti-
mates on the matter! He was suddenly seized
with an incurable complaint, and passed away—
or passed down—without medical assistance. But
the trap-door doesn’t open upwards. It opens
abruptly downwards—-in two halves, as I have
said —whep someone above jerks a sort of
latch arrangement that comes through the floor
and drags back a little bolt. The hinges of the
door extend right across to the edges of them,
and are riveted on. The doors fall downward
and outward ; and to the sides of the joists or
door-jambs underneath are nailed little pieces
of leather or indiarubber —I don’t know which—
to prevent these same doors banging and damag-
ing themselves, or making too much noise and
startling the nervous patients in the adjoining
rooms; for there are two sinister-looking window’s
opening under the roof on to the balcony itself.
And directly underneath, and let into the
cemented floor, as hard as iron itself, is another
door, of iron this time, and in four parts, sup-
ported by a short, movable piece, and covering
a chamber in which is placed, w’hen occasion calls
for it, a big oblong basket, like one of John
Hunter’s boot baskets, only longer. It seems a
strange place to keep a large basket.
But the most curious thing of all about this
balcony is that, in very many cases, the people
W’ho leave it are one less in number than those
who went on it. Thus, if three people go there,
two come away; and if four go there, three come
aw’ay. I puzzled over this a long time, and
thought about discussing the phenomenon with
the strange old bird with the damaged beak, but
I couldn’t find him. I was told that he was a
very rare fowl indeed—the only specimen of his
kind in the State. And there is never more than
one bird of the sort in the State at a time, but it
doesn’t necessarily follow that the bird of the
moment has a damaged beak like the one I
described. He may have any kind of a beak.
As I said already—a nice, sunny place is that
balcony. A convalescent, you would imagine,
might lie around there and get well in ease and
comfort. But there is an uncouth lack of sitting
or lying-down accommodation, and that possibly
militates against recovery. A patient can’t get
better standing up. Yet I have read somewhere
of a man who did a complete recovery on an
exactly similar balcony. The doctors had given
up all hope, when a man arrived on horseback
with some medicine which effected an immediate
cure. But I am not acquainted with the par-
ticulars of the case.

Narrabeen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
WHEN I am tired of travelling
The Road of Fame, I ween
I’ll build a little humpy
And dream at Narrabeen.
By reed and lake I’ll build it,
The green foothills all round,
Where I can see the ocean
And hear the breakers’ sound.
I'll rig a little bookshelf
For half a dozen books,
And buy a gross of sinkers
And fishing-lines and hooks.
Between the honeysuckles,
All summer-time, at least,
I'll sling a sailor’s hammock,
Branch-high and facing east.
I’ll plant a bed of lettuce
And herbs, and never stint
My board of fresh tomatoes,
Asparagus and mint.
For grapes I’ll make a trellis,
And plant a lotus-tree,
And now and then a comrade
I’ll have to stay with me.
And gauds and petty fardels
No more worth struggling for,
Forget, a happy fisher,
The dream of fame of yore.
Forget I was a minstrel,
A painter, old lang syne,
And never paint a picture
And never write a line.
Instead smoke good tobacco
While hours of reverie wing,
And Nature paints her pictures,
And her free children sing.
I'll never lack for comrades
When I am old, I ween,
Among my neighbor fossils,
Wise men of Narrabeen !

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“*T TLLO, Sam,” said Mr. Maunder, glancing
J up from the newspaper he was reading,
as Mr. Sharp entered the room. “ Back
agin. Why, a month ’ardly seems no time, do it,
matey ? ”
Mr. Sharp grunted.
“ They ain’t cut yer ’air ’arf as well as usual,”
continued Jerry, surveying his comrade with a
critical eye. “ Looks kind o’ top-sided like.
Well, set down, Sam ; it’s quite a treat to ’ave
you for a vissy-vee agin arter all this long while,
blow me if it ain’t.”
“ Busy bee yerself! ” retorted Mr. Sharp, curtly.
“ Cow inter the barg’in. Wot yer bin doin’ of
the last four weeks, might I arst ? ”
“ I’ve bin that un’appy an’ mis’rable thinkin’ o’
you pickin’ opium in a ’orrid cold cell, six foot be
four, that I bin wand'rin’ in the bone-yards a-
readin’ the touchin’ epithets on orl the little tomb-
stones. I got a very soft’eart, Sam,” said Mr.
Maunder, with feeling.
“ Very soft ’ead, more like !” commented Mr.
Sharp, frigidly. “ It’s a pity yer won’t be able
to read the epithets I’ll ’ave put on yer little
tombstone when yer bin ’ung. It ’ud do yer
good, mate ! Bill Smithers showed up yet ? ”
“ Bill ain’t doo back in ’is sorrowin’ friends’
bosoms till day arter to-morrer,” said Mr. Maun-
der, resuming his paper. “An’ ’old yer yap,
Sam, for five minutes, if yer possibly ken, while
I finish this ’ere interestin’ story I’m readin’ of.”
Mr. Sharp seated himself on the table, and
lighted a short clay pipe with deliberation.
“Wot yer addlin’ yer silly ole cokernut over
now, Jerry ? ” he inquired affably.
Mr. Maunder kept his place with a large fore-
finger, and winked confidentially upon his ally.
“’ldden treasure,”he vouchsafed, shortly.
“’ldden grandmothers!” sneered Mr. Sharp.
“ Go an’ git yer ’ead read, Jerry.”
“Better than gittin’ it shaved, any’ow!” re-
sponded Mr. Maunder, warmly. “Look ’ere,
Sam, this paper I m readin’ of—the Evenin’
Advertiser—ain't bin started long, an’ —’ere,
wait till I read yer wot it ses : ‘ In order to make
ourselves better know’d to the public, we are
week by week printin’ as a supple—supplement
instalments of a most enthrillin’ novel, entitled
“ Lady Erm—Ermy—somethin’ or other’s Re-
venge.” Each week the sum of one ’undered
pound will be give away gratus in the followin’
manner : —A brass plate, subscribed with our
name, the Evenin’ Advertiser, ’ll be buried
or otherwise concealed in some public spot within
a radium o’ two mile of our orfice, an’ the con-
cludin’ paragraft of each issue of “ Lady Wot’s-
er-name’s Revenge ” ’ll contain a val’able cloo to
the whereabouts of the ’idden treasure. A cheque
fur a ’undered pound ’ll be dooly paid over to
the fort’nate finder of the brass plate upon its
presentiment at our orfice, No. 5 Silver-street.’
There, wot yer say to that, Sam ? ”
“Wot do I say?” replied Mr. Sharp, scorn-
fully. “Why, if yer silly mug enuff to go diggin’
big ’oles ’arf over Melbourne with a pick an’
shovel, you deserve orl yer likely to git; and much
good may it do yer, mate. ”
Mr. Maunder smiled and shook his head.
“It ain’t buried deep, Sam. I shan’t want no
pick an’ shovel. Last week the ’undered pound
was won by some bloke wot lives at Brighton.
I seed ’is name in yesterday’s paper. Chapter
111. come out this evenin’, an’ I reck’n I got the
val’able cloo orright. Listen to this ’ere bit :
‘ They stood face to face at last. ’Aggard ’an
weak ’arter ’is lengthy incarceration ’ ”
“’Ere, Jerry,” remonstrated Mr. Sharp; “wot
are you a-readin’ of? Lend us the paper ’arf a
jiffy. ‘ ’Aggard an’ weak arter ’is lengthy incar-
ceration ’ —dunno wot it means, I ; m sure. Never
mind, go a’ead.”
‘ ‘ ’Aggard an’ weak arter 'is lengthy in—in’—
wotever you ses it was, Sam,” resumed Mr.
Maunder, “‘the man tottered an’ swayed as if
she ’ad smitten ’im a buffet'—thought that was a
place where a bloke kin git a long beer an’
counter-lunch, Sam—buffet full on the mouth.
‘ “ Farewell ! ” ’e ses atween ’is set teeth. “ Fare-
well, crool, crool Erm—Ermy—Ermy’trude ! ’”
—blime, wot a name, Sam ! —‘ an’ ’e staggered
from the room, leavin’ the tremblin’ gurl alone.
Although ’e ’ad departed, she was still conscience
of ’is late presents —it seemed to pervade the ’ole
apartment.’ ”
“Very nicely put, that ’ere,” interrupted Mr.
Sharp, approvingly. “ Same with me whenever
I come ’ome an’ find you’ve jest gone out, Jerry.
I don’t need to be told a mouldy ole man’s bin
in the foom not ’arf an hour ago.”
“Wot do you mean, Sam ?” demanded Mr.
Maunder, sternly.
Mr. Sharp sniffed.
“Go on with ‘the Lady Thing-um-bob’s
Avenge,’ Jerry,” he urged. “ I’m that excited I
kin’ardly set still.”
“ ‘ She flung wide the winder,’ ” continued Mr.
Maunder after a brief but pregnant pause.
“ Quite right, too !” put in Mr. Sharp.
“ ‘ An’ leanin’ over the parapet,’ ” pursued Mr.
Maunder, “‘gazed down inter the silent street
below. There was a light still burnin’ in the
turret of the ’ouse opposite, which told ’er that
Sir John ’ad not yet retired to rest. Presently
she sor a dark figger steal stealthily acrost a narrer
strip o’ waste land that lay ad-adjutant to the
worthy knight’s abode an’ start diggin’ in the left
’and corner of the vacant allotment. To be con-
tinued nex’ week.’ ”
Sam stretched himself and yawned.
“ Yer welcome to any cloo yer can find in that
’ere rubbish ’eap, Jerry,” he said, contemptu-
ously. “Well, I'm goin’ out now fur a stroll.
Coinin’ ? ”
Mr. Maunder shook his head.
“ Not to-night, Sam,” he said gently. “The
pleasure o’ seein’ yer ’andsome liniments agin ’as
bin too much fur me, I s’pose. I shall turn in
early an’ try an’ sleep the ’orrible feelin’ off.”
“ Please yerself,” remarked Mr. Sharp, with
indifference. “ I ain’t particular anxious to ’ave
yer.”
He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and,
quitting the room, left Mr. Maunder to his
meditations.
Jerry did not meditate long. He, too, de-
scended the narrow staircase and issued into the
free and open air of Heaven. It was after io
o’clock. What little light there was came from a
flying moon that dodged through the clouds like
a football player. Jerry walked rapidly for him,
and paused not until he came to a quiet by-street
of respectable villa residences. Plaiting beneath
a lamp, he gazed uneasily up and down the road.
There was no one in sight. The big boots of no
peripatetic policeman disturbed the sleeping
echoes. On the opposite side of the way stood a
house of peculiar architectural design. A small
turret, somewhat resembling an immense pepper-
box, flanked one wing, and overlooked a small
strip of vacant ground surrounded by a dilapidated
picket-fence.
“ If this ain’t the place, I dunno wot is,” mur-
mured Mr. Maunder. “’Tori events it’s worth
tryin’.”
He crossed the road, and carefully insinuating
his body into a gap in the allotment fence, suc-
ceeded after a brief but severe struggle in effecting
an entrance. Stumbling over a debris of broken
crockeryware and derelict pots and pans, he
sought the left-hand corner of the property, and,
taking a trowel from his coat pocket, proceeded
to dig with vigor. The ground was soft after
recent rain, and in a few minutes the treasure-
seeker had scooped a hole of tolerable dimensions,
perhaps a foot deep. Suddenly the trowel en-
countered resistance. Jerry's heart beat loud and
fast. Kneeling dovyn, he thrust his hand into the
hole and drew forth a small japanned box. At
that precise moment the mOem threw a shaft of
pallid light full on the crouching figure. With
trembling fingers Jerry tried the lid of the box.
It was unlocked. Within, carelessly jumbled
together, and giving back the rays of the inquisi-
five moon, lay a heap of loose jewellery. Dazzled
by the sight of so much wealth, Jerry knelt and
feasted his protruding eyes on the spectacle. He
touched the glittering trinkets gingerlv. as if to
assure himself of their reality.
“ Blime ! ” he gasped at last, in a species of
ecstasy. “If this ain’t a bit o’ luck ! Better
than a mouldy ole brass plate, any’ow.”
“Who are you, sir? What are you doing
here ? What is the meaning of all this ? ”
Jerry slowly turned a petrified glance upon the
speaker, an elderly gentleman with a long white
beard.
“ What is the meaning of this ?” He pointed
with a claw-like finger at the japanned box, and
his eye dwelt sternly upon the agitated Mr.
Maunder.
“ The Lady Ermy—Ermy’trude ” —began the
latter feebly, but the old gentleman interrupted
him.
“ Why are you trespassing on my property,
sir ? And ” (here Ids voice rose to a shrill falsetto
squeak) “ what, in Heaven's name, are you doing
with my wife’s jewels ? They were stolen a
month ago, when my house, next door there, was
burglariously broken into, and among other valu-
able articles these jewels were taken. ”
“ Evenin’ Advertiser,” murmured the em-
barrassed Mr. Maunder.
“Wait,” insisted the old gentleman, auto-
cratically. “On behalf of my wife, I notified in
the columns of the Evening Advertiser that I
would give a liberal reward to whoever lodged
information which would lead to the recovery of
this jewellery. Are you referring to that ?”
Mr. Maunder rose to his feet with some show of
dignity.
“ I dreamt o’ this ’ere plant on’y last night, sir,”
he observed, mendaciously. “ It’s me ’abit to
’ave very eggstrordinary dreams. People come to
me from ’arf over the world whenever they wants
their lost properties discovered for ’em.”
The sternness of the old gentleman’s gaze
changed into bewilderment.
“ But you mentioned a lady’s name, if I’m not
mistaken,” he remarked. “ Lady”
“The Lady Ermy’trude,” prompted Mr.
Maunder. ‘ ‘ She’s wot they calls a austral speerit,
wot appears to me in me dreams an’ tells me
where to look fur thin’s.”
“ Dear me, this is extremely interesting!” said
the old gentleman. “My good sir, you must
really pardon the very natural suspicions with
which I at first regarded your presence here at
this late hour.”
“ I on'y ’as the power give me of a night-time,”
explained Mr. Maunder. “It comes over me
orl of a sudden, like.”
“ I myself am at present much engrossed in the
study of psychical matters, especially those relating
to the cult of Spiritualism,” continued the old
gentleman. “My name, sir, is Viall —Abner
Viall. ”
Mr. Maunder wrinkled his brow in a great
mental effort. “ Mine's Kidger, sir—Perfesser
Kidger, they calls me,” he said, at last.
“ Indeed,” said Mr. Viall. “ I am very pleased
to make your acquaintance. Will you not step in-
doors with me, Professor ? I am sure my wife
would wish to thank you for your most successful
efforts on her behalf.”
Mr. Maunder hesitated. Here was all hope of
the glittering treasure vanishing before his very
eyes. Should he knock the old gentleman down
and make off with the box ? Too risky, he
thought, and with a sigh he banished the tempta-
tion. At any rate the reward remained.
“ I’m quite willin’, sir,” he stated. “Not that
I wants no thanks, though, for a doin’ of my
manifold dooty.”
“ You are a very noble-spirited person, sir,”
declared Mr. Viall, warmly. “ I look upon you
as an honor to this great city.” He conducted
Mr. Maunder by way of a small gate into the
front garden of the house with the miniature
turret, then up a flight of stone steps and through
an entrance-hall into an elaborately-furnished
room. In it sat a plump, middle-aged lady,
whose dress was cut low' in front and lower at the
back.
“ My dear, allow' me to introduce Professor
Kidger, an eminent figure in psychological circles,”
said the old gentleman.
Mr. Maunder grinned sheepishly. The middle-
aged lady stared, took off her glasses, polished
them, stared again, and finally, after some hesi-
tation, offered Jerry her plump hand.
“ I’m very pleased to meet you, Professor
Kitchen,” said the lady of the house.
“And indeed, so you should be, my love,”
remarked her husband, with enthusiasm. “ Look
what the Professor has brought you.” He de-
posited the japanned box in his wife’s lap.
Mrs. Viall raised the lid, gave a faint scream,
and flung up her hands.
“Oh, my jewels!” she cried. “My lost
jewels ! ”
“Yes,” continued the old gentleman; “for
which you have to thank Professor Kidger—not
Kitchen, my dear. He, with the aid of a lady—
Lady Ermyntrude, I think you said, Professor?- —
by extraordinary occult means discovered the
whereabouts of your jewels. Only think, Emma,
they were buried in the vacant allotment next
door to us the whole time. Now in future jou
will not Ire so ready to make fun of my super-
stitious ideas, as?you call them, eh ?■’’
“ Pm sure I am exceedingly grateful to you,
Professor Kisser,” said Mrs. Viall, with feeling,
“and to your lady friend as well. 1 hope you
will thank her kindly for me.”
“ Sperrit, mum,” stated Mr. Maunder, briefly •
“ on’y visible of a night time.”
“ Talking of spirits,” added the materialistic
Mrs. Viall; “ won’t you offer the Professor some
whisky, Abner ? ”
“ I really beg your pardon. lam afraid I’m
very thoughtless,” Said the old gentleman, apolo-
getically ; “but the excitement of the evening
has been too much for me, I think. You will
take a little refreshment, Professor Kidger ? ”
“ Don’t mind if I do,” admitted Mr. Maunder,
wiping his lips on the back of his hand.
He was imbibing a brown whisky and soda
when Mrs. Viall suddenly gave a shrill exclama-
tion.
“ Oh, Abner,” she cried ; “ the diamond pen-
dant you gave me on our wedding day has dis-
appeared ! ”
Mr. Maunder choked, and, to cover his con-
fusion, hastily replenished his glass.
“ That’ll be orright, mum,” he remarked, with
an emphatic nod. “ I'll find it fur yer—me an’
the Lady Ermy’trude.”
“ Your hear what the Professor says, Emma,”
said Mr. Viall, admiringly. “ Pie is going to
exercise his wonderful gifts once more, in order to
recover the pendant, just as he located the rest of
your jewels.”
“ I really don't know how to thank you, sir,”
said Mrs. Viall, almost tearfully. “ I wouldn’t
have lost my Abner’s pendant for the whole wide
world, not so much on account of its intrinsic
value as because it was his wedding present to
me. ”
The old gentleman patted his wife’s hand
fondly.
“ There, there!” he said, soothingly.
“ And,” resumed Mrs. Viall, “I am sure the
reward of we thought of offering has been
well earned by Professor Killer and'his good lady
friend.”
“Hush! Hush, my love!” said the old
gentleman, warningly and with uplifted finger.
“The Professor would never hear of-taking
money in return for his invaluable services. 1
am certain my wife did not mean to offend you,
my dear sir. Please overlook her well-meaning
but indiscreet suggestion.”
“ Well, of course, that’s so much the better,”
said Mrs. Viall, not without relief. “ Twentv
pounds is a lot of money, let alone the advertising
in the evening papers.”
The speechless Mr. Maunder glared upon his
entertainers. Rough and ready words came
crowding to the tip of his tongue, but fortunately
indignation choked them ere they had time to make
themselves heard. Old Mr. Viall gazed upon his
guest’s convulsed features in some alarm.
“ My dear,” he whispered to his wife, in a stage
aside, “ I fancy the Professor is about to fall
into a trance. Pray observe the singular expres-
sion of his very striking countenance.”
“He looks as if he’s going to have a fit or
something, murmured Mrs. Viall, solicitously.
“ Poor man ! I think perhaps you'd better take
him out on to the verandah, Abner.”
With a great effort Mr. Maunder mastered his
feelings. He finished his whisky at a gulp, and
still surveying his host and hostess with a malevo-
lent eye, groped for his hat, then turning his back
unceremoniously upon them, he quitted the room
in the midst of a most impressive silence. Mr.
Viall pursued him as far as the front door and
grasped him warmly by the hand.
“Good-bye, my dear sir, ’’ he said, with some
emotion. “We shall always be pleased to see
you whenever you feel inclined to drop in here for
a chat. You will not forget your promise of in-
quiring into the strange disappearance of my wife’s
pendant, I feel certain.”
The psychical Mr. Maunder shook his head,
solemnly. “ Can t say, ’m sure. Depends on
the stars —the ’eavenly infloo—inflooces,” he
said thickly, and swaying slightly from side to
side. “ Goo’ night.”
He stumbled down the steps, and, as the door
closed behind him, fell headlong into a clump of
chrysanthemums.
Mr. Sharp was lying in bed, reading the even-
ing paper by the light of a candle, when the door
opened and Mr. Maunder and a strong smell of
whisky entered the room together.
“’Ullo, Jerry !”said Sam. “ Wherever yer bin,
matey ? Diggin’ fur ’idden treasures ? ”
Mr. Maunder nodded, curtly.
“That’s jest eggsackly wot I,’ave bin a-doin’
of, Sam ; an’ I found ’em too, in a vacant bit o’
ground top end o’ Arundel-road, nex’ door to a
’ouse where a ole bald-’eaded bloke named Vile
lives. A japan-box full o’ luverl-y jew’ls. I give
’em back to the pore ole man an’°is missus.”
Mr. Sharp sat suddenly erect. He laid down
his newspaper and regarded Mr. Maunder’s
flushed countenance with genuine consternation.
“ Eh—wot ? Arundel-road ? ’Ere, Jerry, ’ave
you gone loony, or are yer 011’y drunk ? ”
“ It’s a fac’,” said Mr. Maunder, vain-
gloriously. “ I've bin drinkin’ whiskies an’ soda-
waters with the ole bloke orl the blessed evenin’.”
Mr. Sharp lay back in bed and shook with
silent laughter.
“ Lord, Jerry ! ” he gurgled, wiping the tears
from his eyes with a corner of’his blanket, “if
you ain’t done it proper this time ! Why, mate,
that ’ere must ha’ bin pore ole Bill’s plant. I
know ’im an’ ‘ Spotty ’ Pink did a bit of business
at ole man Vile’s jest afore the pair of ’em got
jugged fur a month along o’ that Cook-street Push
scrap. Wot wouldn't I give to see pore Bill’s
mug when ’e finds some’un’s bin afore’and with
’im. Oh, Jerry, Jerry, you'll be the death o’ me
one o’ these fine days ! ”
“You won’t make no mischief, Sam?” in-
quired Mr. Maunder, a shade anxiously.
“ Not me,” replied Mr. Sharp, speaking with ”
difficulty. “‘Ow much reward did the ole bloke
give yer, matey ? ”
Mr. Maunder pursed up his lips.
“ I don’t want no rewards fur doin’ me bound-
in’ dooty, Sam,” he observed, virtuously. “ I'm
glad I spoilt Bill’s little game ; maybe it’ll be a
lesson to’im fur the future. The ole gen’leman
begged an’ prayed of me to eggscep’ a ’undered
an’ twen’y pound fur findin’ ’is pore wife’s lost
jew’ls ; but I tell 'im to ’and it over to the horse-
pittle fur the mentally afflicted, fur look at it I
would not.”
“The mentally-inflicted, indeed !” retorted
Mr. Sharp with acerbity. “If ’e’d ha' give it to
you ’e’d ha’ give it to the mentally-inflicted
orright. Don’t b’lieve a word of it, mate—catch
you refusin’ anythink. D’ver mean to tell me,
then, you ain't got nothin’ to show fur yer night’s
work ? Blitne, yer might jist as well ’ave left
the loot fur Bill an’ ‘ Spotty,’ you—you bur-
rowin’ ole badger ! ”
“ I’ve got a clean conscious, that’s orl I arst,”
remarked Mr. Maunder, unctuously. “ I on’y
'ope you may ave the same, Samuel.”
“ Ho* indeed ! If yer conscience ain't no
cleaner than that face o’ yers, yer’d better make
’aste an’ put it in soak,” suggested Sam, bitterly.
“ You ain't got no more sense than a babe
unborn, Jerry. ’Ere, wot’s that yer gloatin’
over, yer ugly alligator ? ”
“A little somethin’ wot they calls a soovenear,
Sam,” said the alligator, with a distinct chuckle.
“Pretty, ain’t it?” He held up a gold pen-
dant, richly studded with gems, which flashed in
the feeble light of the solitary candle.
“Blitne ! ’ gasped Mr. Sharp, wide eyed with
astonishment. “If the ole bloke ain’t a reg’lar
bag o' tricks ! ’Ooever'd yer pinch it from
Jerry ? ”
“ The Lady Ermy trade give it me, Sam,” said
Mr. Maunder.

you? Billum’s male friends rather cut him for s vain-
popinjay, though the ladies thought the doctor with his new stylo
of head-dress just too kilting.
8. “ And, seventhly,” concluded*
the good man, ” if you persist in going-
about like that you will be in danger of”
10. Billum’s retreat to and plunge into the sea was precipitate and spec-
tacular. “ Don't put yourself out on our account,” shouted his appreciative-
audience.
The new head-dress was never generally adopted by the Ki>Yians..
9, "Hell fire!” At those words, accompanied by a series of explosions,-
BiUumbullo the Vain awoke. He had been nodding over his smouldering camp-
fire during most of the sermon.
BILLUMBULLOO’S HEAD-DRESS.


Revolt.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I AM very tired of villas in the style of good
Queen Ann,
Of weatherboard, and stuccoed bricks and
plaster;
I am sick of streets and gutters and the fcetidness
of man,
And I’d like to be my own and only master.
I’d like to get away into some wild sequestered
spot
Where picnicker or tourist never ventures,
Where the mason is a myth, and solicitors
are not,
And you never hear of titles or debentures.
I am weary of the public and the blatant
printing-press,
Of the litigant, the dustman, the
attorney;
From Electors’ Rights and Missions,
Ethics, Golf and Evening
Dress
I would like to take a far-ex-
tended journey.
I would like to be a sluggard where the skies
above are blue,
Where the earth is better-clad and somewhat
greener;
Where you cannot make a contract with an old-
man kangaroo,
Or charge a mallee-hen with misdemeanor.'
The moral codes of bandicoots may be the
letter X ;
You do not look for politics with ’possums ;
And speckled trout are innocent of any
wild-cat specs
For getting out the gold from
wattle-blossoms.
The emus never have one up before
the local beak ;
Koalas do not fuss about their raiment;
There is peace among the rushes, and a
stillness in the creek,
And the dingoes never dog a chap for
payment.
O, to lie and hear the lyre-birds, and see the
bumble-bees
A-seeking in the spleen-wort after honey ;
To watch the wombats roosting in the lofty
lignum trees,
Where all the world is sibilant and sunny.
Ah, I’d like to get away, afar from turbulence
and town,
From furniture, frivolities and felons ;
To leave its dust and dolors, and to sweetly settle
down
And cast my lot with peace and paddymelons.
VICTORIA.

The Invalid.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
MR. EDWARD HISKINS had thin hair
and an elegant expression.
His hat was long and shiny ; he' wore
gloves and spats ; beneath his black claw-hammer
coat he displayed a
neat flowered waist-
coat with big glass
buttons that shone
like cats’ eyes. He
looked a gentleman,
in the esoteric Eng-
lish sense. His voice
was gentle, his
speech slow and
correct. Fie sug-
gested tone, and
gave the impression
that he would rather
perish than dine
without a finger-
bowl.
Mrs. McNair, an
elderly Scotch lady,
very proper, very
genteel—she always
lowered the blinds
on Sunday and put
on her best black
bombazine whenever
she expected a call
from the minister—
spoke of her star
boarder in the same
reverent tone that
she adopted in re-
ferring to the lead-
ing characters in the
Floly Bible.
Mr. Hiskins gave
no trouble. He was
a model. Even
when the sausages
were frizzled, or the
joint as tough as a
stockbroker’s mor-
als, he never stooped
to coarse jokes, like
Mr. Wilkins and
others —never even
suggested that any-
thing exceptional had arrived.
The other boarders didn’t appreciate Mr.
Hiskins. He was above them ; and they were
jealous. All the titbits, the crispest crumpet,
the blood gravy when there was any, the kidney
in the loin of mutton, drifted the star boarder’s
way.
He was a quiet man, too. Fie hated noisy
laughter, loud talk, excited arguments about the
date of the Franco-Prussian war—any signs of
bad breeding.
“ It is bad taste to argue,” he said simply, sip-
ping his soup delicately.
MOTHS AND THE MAN
OF RESOURCE.
No. I.-“ Ha! This
is awkward. My only
dress-coat , and tails
riddled by moths! Must
keep my engagement at
that dinner!"
No. 2. —“ Great
scissors! That was
a happy thought!”
No. 3.— “Ha!
A dinner-jacket!
Situation saved.”
His action implied that Mr. Wilkins could take
it as a personal matter if he thought fit.
In private, Mr. Hiskins confided to Mrs.
McNair that he had to leave Mrs. Smith’s board-
ing-house, a rival establishment in the same
street, owing to the presence of a certain Mr.
Stewart.
A TENDER VOW.
’ER : “ Yer will go strate for the fewcher, Jim,
won’t yer? ”
’IM: " Doan't I tell yet I've done wif quod.”
’ER : “ Yer means it?”
’IM: “’ Course I means it.”
’ER: "Promise me solemn that you'll never
pinch anyfink but me ever again.”
'IM: “ Strike me dead! Liza.”
’ER : “ Gawd bless yer , Jim.”
“ The man drank.” His voice quavered. He
could say no more.
Mrs. McNair was shocked Yet—Mrs.
McNair’s shrfke of the head was expressive—
what could be expected at such a place as Mrs.
Smith’s !
Mr. Hiskins’ popularity increased
like the gas-bill.
One morning, Mr. Hiskins did not
appear at the breakfast-table. Mrs.
McNair was surprised. He was always so
regular in his habits.
He was not present at lunch. He had
“ nerves.”
Over the hash, the guests related all the
illnesses each had ever had or heard of.
“Such a refined
gentleman!” Mrs.
McNair said, sym-
pathetically, gaz-
ing earnestly at
Mr. Wilkins, who
had a vulgar taste
for comic songs
and two helpings
of pork.
That afternoon
Mrs. McNair tap-
ped gently at Mr.
Hiskins’ door. A
voice from the
depths replied :
“An attack. No-
thing. Itw'illsoon
pass. ”
The landlady
was soft-hearted.
“ What can I
do, Mr. Hiskins?
Some tea and
toast, fish ? ”
“No, thank you
kindly, madam,”
replied the polite
voice. “Thedoc-
tor orders me the
rest cure. I am
run down. lam
not allowed solid
food. I must have
perfect quiet . . .
four days’ sleep.
It is nothing.”
Mrs. McNair W'as much too proper
to peep through the door.
Mr. Hiskins’ room was situated on
the ground floor, looking out on the
yard.
At half-past three one morning a
strange scene was enacted in the
invalid’s room.
The invalid, wild-eyed, dishevelled,
lifting a gaunt frame amid a heap of
blankets, whispered huskily to a bottle-oh :
“ Don’t make a noise. Take those bottles
away. You can have them for nothing.” He
pointed a thin, shiverirg hand vaguely round the
room.
“ Right O, boss ! ” said the bottle-oh. “ It’s a
big job.”
“No noise,” the invalid cautioned.
Bill was a tradesman. Eagerly he filled his
bag. He crawled under the bed, opened the
chest of drawers, emptied the coal scuttle; he
found bottles everywhere. They seemed to in-
crease and multiply like articles evolved from a
conjuring trick. Bill’s bag bulged like the Ex-
hibition dome, the neck of the last brandy bottle
sticking out like a spire.
The invalid watched Bill step
out of the sick chamber as
stealthily as a cat.
Mr. Hiskins had reached
the depressing, sicken-
ing end of a four days’
jamboree. He only
broke out every eight
or nine months, and
his cunning outclassed
that of an insurance
agent.
A matured drunk’s
wisdom exceedeth that of Socrates.
Mr. Hiskins liked to select a quiet respectable
house, always with a room open to the yard. Ex-
eprience had taught him to time himself to the tick.
His stores —medicine chests of beer, whisky and
brandy—were carefully brought in at night and in-
geniously hidden. He arranged for a bottle-oh
to call early on the fifth morning, before the house
: awoke, to remove the debris.
He began on beer ; finished on brandy. He
mixed his sensations like an artist. Better than
any politician he knew when the time had
arrived. On the third night he reached his grand
climax, began to see the holy beasts, became
thrilled with horrors. By the fourth night his
cravings were satisfied. His attack of nerves had
passed. For a fortnight he would be weak and
helpless ; but kindly landladies would pour gruel
and gravy into his shattered system, and he would
be a gentle and refined English gentleman for
another eight or nine months.
Mr. Hiskins had reduced the jamboree to a fine
art, even to an exact science. No one had ever
suggested that Mr. Hiskins even knew the taste of
alcohol.
What was that ?
The sick man jumped out of his blankets.
Bang! Crash! Smash! The noise would
have wakened the dead.
Bill the bottle-oh had slipped over a clothes
prop, and his bag tumbled and burst on the as-
phalted yard.
Windows were thrown up ; half a dozen houses
looked down on the yard. Bald and curl-papered
heads were violently thrust out. Screams broke
the calm chill of the morning.
In the fatal yard Bill, torn and bleeding, cursed
the catastrophe. Broken bottles lay everywhere.
Bottles—there were a dozen of brandy, a dozen of
whisky, innumerable of beer.
“ Blarst it!’’-cried Bill. “Bang govvs ther
prawfil ! ”
Lodgers shuffled round, with critical eyes. The
glass pierced their slippers, and they groaned.
It was like an explosion in a glass bottle factory.
Feverish, hysterical, in wrapper and slippers,
Mrs. McNair felt as though an earthquake or the
Last Day had arrived.
“The invalid’s medicine!” exclaimed Mr.
Wilkins in a loud voice. The neighbors tittered.
Bill left his trophies and climbed over the fence.
In a frenzy of anguish Mrs. McNair shrieked that
Mr. Hiskins had better go back to Mrs. Smith’s.

On the Indestructibility of Scandal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“The evil that men do lives after them.”—Siiakspbark.
WE observe, as we carry our bundle
Of care through this valley of tears,
That a scandal, once started, will trundle
- Unchecked through processions of years.
Though the good that we do ain’t recorded,
Or ever remembered, we find
That our sins are quite sure to be hoarded
Like gold, in the thoughts of mankind.
That to suffer injustice we’re fated,
And never to have a fair deal
As a race, since the world was created,
A glance at the past will reveal.
Look at Adam —bucolic and hearty
When first he was put on the land —
Quite unlike the suburbanite party
Who taketh a lantern in hand,
And walketh at nightfall and killeth
The slug on the cabbage and rose.
Yet they say his relations with Lilith—
A minx t-o the tips of her toes —
Were shocking and highly improper.
That’s while he was having his fling ;
Though he doubtless pretended to drop her
When Eve took him under her wing.
It is said, though, of bullocks and horses
He talked when he went out to tea —
If there’d been any courts for divorce^
Then Eve might have got her “ deci :>. ”
But her reason for rather preferring
To file no “ petition,” she owned,
Was, she’d nothing to wear at the hearing ;
And so his offence w'as condoned.
Condoned, yes, perhaps, but be certain
The skeleton grinned not in vain ;
That kind friends came and lifted the curtain
That hid it, again and again.
That each man told his fidus Achates ,
Each hag told her favorite minx,
As they strolled by the banks of Euphrates,
With whispers and giggles and winks.
The youths told the maids, and waxed merry—
We all like a yarn that defames—
And the folks on the Tigris were very
Like those on the Trent and the Thames.
And the scandal, though ancient and hoary,
Is fresh in the minds of us all
As when first they repeated the Story
In whispers, just after the “ Fall,”
Take the story of Paris, the shepherd,
And Helen of Sparta and Troy ;
Well, they’ve both been bespattered and pep-
pered
With scandal
enough to
destroy
A FUSS ABOUT
NOTHING.
DINER : “Here,
waiter , is this
mutton , beef, or
lamb you've
brought me?"
WAITER : “ Can’t you
tell by the taste , sir
DINER: “ No !“
WAITER: “ What's it matter , then?”
The very last remnant and rag of
A character whiter than snow
(Not that either had any to brag of
Or boast of, as characters go).
But the point is, of course, that though ages
Have passed since they lived their brief lives,
And annexed their fair share of the wages
Of sin, still the scandal survives.
If they did any good, it’s forgotten ;
We only remember one thing,
That’s the trick —most decidedly rotten —
They played Menelaus, the King.
It’s the way of the world, oh my brothers !
It’s sad, but it’s awfully true,
’Tis your friends, as a rule, and no others
Who keep your shortcomings in view.
They will patiently rake in the ashes
Of scandals—rewarded at last
If a spark, with a few feeble flashes,
Illumines some shame of the past.
They will fan every smouldering ember ;
So never, my brother, forget
That the things people mostly remewba
Are those that we mostly regret.

anthem free and swinging —
Hear viy joyous anthem ringing over

At my sawdust-garnished altar Labor sings a
shining psalter ;
Fools may cringe and priests may palter lam
shifting log and spar.
There the timber mills are roaring, I, the
Breaker-Down am warring —
Hear my song of battle soaring as I fight with
tooth and claw !
Oh, the glory of the fighting, and the glory in the
smiting —
Oh, the blade for ever biting—l am steel ; lam

Breaking down the fragrant cedar, spoil of Lebanon
and Kedar,
Felled by Arab, Yank or Swede, or Austra-
lander, Russ or Finn ;
Here is Toil’s eternal fount-head—here the peoples
strong, uncounted,
Strip the hillside and the mount-head so that
Man may shelter win !
Here the saw the trees are breaking—here the
fighting world is waking,
Homes for manhood I am making as my teeth
bite deep and gnaw ;
Strong am I to cleave and sever, lam Man s I
serve him ever,
I am fruit of his endeavor —Master mine, I am

Here great peoples, strong and passioned, forth
from steel my blade have fashioned —
And with oil ’tis fed and rationed. Of the oak
and teak and pine,
The vast trunks I bite asunder—grip them fast
and drag them under,
So I grasp my mountain-plunder, for the forest
lands are mine.
From the islands of the Maori forth they bring
the fallen kauri —
Where the crimson-flashing lowrie builds his
nest, there runs my law ;
Where the redwood skyward lifting sees the
clouds go stormward drifting,
There mine axes swift are shifting—they are
mine. lam the Saw !
Kings the earth all useless cumber in their sloth
and idle slumber —
See ! I cleave the deals and lumber —I, the
strong, swift-tearing one ;
While the smaller things are creeping, through
the jarrah I am sweeping—
Through the timbers I am leaping, rending teak
and Oregon !
While the poet-folk are dreaming, hear my buzz-
ing comrades screaming—
See my Blade all sword-like gleaming, void of
blemish and of flaw ;
T, the wrecker, still am working whilst the paltry
kings are shirking,
And the priests in shades are lurking, hear me
sing—l am the Saw !

Feed me fast, aye, feed me faster ! Lo, I am
his willing thrall ;
I who serve him, Man, omnific, toil and throb
with speed terrific—
See, each side the wide Pacific ’neath his strokes
the giants fall !

Saw its earliest charter written—trees are
strong, but kings are straw ;
Man the Titan —hail ! O hail him. Steel and

Vassals all, when storms assail him they shall

Drummin'.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE sun-bathers were in session in the end
dressing-shed, honored by the name “ The
Sons of Rest Retreat,” scrawled in pencil
on the weatherboard wall. A dozen of them, in
various stages of brownness, sprawled in the
scorching rays or anointed one another with
cocoanut oil. Among the heaps of clothing on
the seats were two or three blue caps trimmed
with silver lace.
“What’s become o’ Micky?” asked the
Omelet, trying to screw his body into such a
position that he could see the reflection of the
small of his back in a scrap of mirror.
“Went out las’ week,” replied a chorus of
three.
“ BUDGEREE! MARY ANN.”
“Go on!” breathed the Omelet. “How?”
“ Th’ Face scored on him,” muttered Ginger,
vindictively.
“Th’ Face!” echoed the Omelet, knitting his
lowering brows. The Omelet, unlike most of
those present, had never been associated with the
Tramway service, and he was ignorant of techni-
calities.
“Yairs,” assented Ginger, “th’ Face at th’
Winder —the nasty-tempered cow that jumps on
yer when yer never expect him, an’ screws at yer
journal.”
“It was him that copped you, wasn’t it,
Ginger ? ” suggested a voice from the far end.
“ Yairs,” replied Ginger reflectively. He pon-
dered for a few moments over the prosperous
days he spent collecting fares that never reached
the coffers of an opulent State before the State
decided to dispense with his expensive services.
Then the bitterness wore off, and he became com-
municative again.
“ That there Face’s a fair cow an’ no error,”
he began. “ They’s no hope for a bit o’ drum-
min’ when he’s about. Yer don’t see him standin’
out in the road waitin' fur the tram ter come
along. Not him ! He don’t play the game fair,
lie’s up a bit o’ a side street under cover all th’
time. I never seen a Boer as good fur talcin’
cover all th’ time I was in South Africa. Then
he’s out an’ on ter yer before yer can git yer pencil
out. D’yer know what ? A bloke as was on th’
Curl Ctirl line tole me—yer know what sort it is :
good fur a sure five bob a day ter a careful bloke —
he tells me as how the Face used ter lay for ’em
there. No ferry fur him. He knoo as well as
they did how they could see him cornin’ from the
wharf; so wPat used he do but make ago on the
Mosman fellers as far as th’ Spit, an’ then walk
across an’ chip in half-way between Curl Curl an’
Manly. What d’yer think o’ a mean underhand
cow like that ? Eh, Swino, you know him.”
Swino rubbed viciously at his chest with the
cocoanut oil. “ Aw—him ! ” he murmured.
The remainder of his criticisms of the Face’s
methods were unrepeatable.
“But, anyhow,” continued Ginger, “Micky
was lookin’ for it. I’m not one ter say a bloke
shouldn’t take a fair trade risk when he starts a
bit o’ drutnmin’, but Micky played off-side.
He must ha’ bin up io times afore he went out.
What a bloke on the trams wants is a bit o’ dis-
crimination. Yer want ter pick yer mark. Yer
want ter be able ter size up a bloke be lookin’ at
him, an’ that’s what Micky couldn’t do. I seen
him pass off a penny ticket on a bloke as had
been travellin’ over the three sections for io
years, an’ try ter battle it out when the bloke
squealed.”
“ They’s no sense in that,” remarked Swino,
with the air of the true critic.
“Sense !” cried Ginger, “ Micky’s sense was
in his feet. He was as sure fur a tumble as a
steeplechase jock. Now, ef ever they was an
artist, it was Mack.”
'■'■Long Mack ?” murmured Swino, admiringly.
“ My oath he was.”
“ Long Mack,” continued Ginger, “ was one
o’ the kid-silly sort. Firs’ o’ all, he come outer
one o’ th’ Contingents inter th’ Customs, I think
it was. He lasted there about a year. Then
they tumbled ter him an’ passed him out. Then,
Mack got inter the p’lice force. For 18 months
he was the good little boy at th’ Sunday-school.
After that they smelt somethin’. I suppose they
heard about him at the Customs. Anyhow,
they kep’ an eye on Mack, but, my word, he was
the model cop they’d b’n lookin’ for for years.
Then one o’ these cunnin’ blokes noticed that
every time they was a fire, where Long Mack was
on juty, the salvage stock was a lot smaller than
it oughter be. So they put a bloke on ter screw,
an’ out Long Mack went, an’ they got about 20
poun’o’terbacker outer th’meter-box up where
he lived in Surry. Mack thought it was up ter
him ter try th’ trams after that, an’ along he comes
in a noo uniform collectin’. He kidded ’em all
good an’ lovely. Even th’ Face was bit. They
reckoned he was th’ stupidest that ever happened.
His journal was always boxed up, an’ every night
he’d near cry over th’ money he said he’d lost
somehow he didn’t know. Up at the depdt, they
felt very sorry for Long Mack. He seemed ter
be workin’ fur his health. All his wages was
gone in squarin’ up what he’d messed in change.
He was an artist, Mack. He never let us inter
it—kep’ all th’ good things ter himself, an’ was
layin’ up th’ foundations o’ a start in life.
“ Th’ firs’ sniff I got was one day when I got
on aLa Perouse car out near Randwick. There
was Mack standin’ on the back lookin’ sorrerful.
I felt quite sorry for the poor bloke as was doin’
in all his hard-earned for other people. Then I
gave a screw along the cars, an’ my word, it was
jest great. Thirty people on the tram —all o’
them mugs from the country, or from Melbourne,
in Sydney seein’ the sights—an’ every bloomin’
one o’ them had penny tickets. Thirty passengers
at sixpence apiece ; an’ the whole lot had gone
inter Mac’s bag.
“I’ll never forgit Mac. ‘What d’yous boys
...can by drummin’ ?’ he arsts us one night, an’,
b ,: me, if we didn’t think he meant it at th’ time. ’
“ Little Mac was a strong joint, too ? ” sug-
gested Swino.
“He was that,” agreed Ginger. “Hi s reign
was short but brilliant; I knoo little Mac e
he was on the job. There ain’t more than h ye or
six o’ th’ boys that ever seen him. was ° J,
out one day. Little Mac had luck. I e v /
first day he was seen out collecting was a . &
holiday, an’ he was put on one o’ th’ extra on 1 •
Yer know what th’ Bondi traffic is on Anniversary
Days —crowds hangin’ on by. their eye ro
everywhere there’s anythin’ stickin’ out far enoug
ter grip, an’ three cars every time. Tha w
what little Mac got. He done his work splendKUy
—never missed a fare; but, when the ay
over, there was no little Mac. Journal, tic e ,
bag an’ all was gone, an’ none o’ them has bin e
o’ since. They reckon as how little, Mac scored
near 30 quid in that one day’s work.’
A hush fell over the assemblage. Even the
Omelet looked contemplative. He w a \ w °?" er '
ing after all whether, when his old-established
two-up school was closed by the operations o
Gaming Act, he would not have been wiser to
have taken employment in the Tramway serv
rather than adopt the precarious profession
was Wibs Jones,” continued Ginger.
“ He never done no drummin’ ; never looked or
tickets on th’ floor, an’ always had his journal up
ter th’ mark. But he done well. He worked
on a system. ‘ Never give change for go ,
says Wibs ; an’ that was what he useter rely on.
Whenever a bloke passed out a thin un, 1 s
give him threepence change an’ pass on. An 1
was wonderful how often it come off, too. Xl ? e
times outer 10, th’ blokes’d put the fray 1 in
their kicks an’ says nothin’. Wibs’s trouble was
through tryin’ ter play it off on one o the big
men in th’ Commissioners’ office. That comes o
bein’ careless. When a bloke takes on a job like
this, the firs’ thing he’s got ter do is ter know all
the blokes that’s likely ter be dangerous.
“ The association paper’s useful,’ remarke
Swino. “ I got a file o’ em at home, with the
portraits o’ all the narks, an' when I joined 1
useter spend me spare time studyin' ’em up. ,
“But the safest game o’ the lot the on y
abserlootly safe game,” went on Ginger, “ is ter
keep yer eyes open for tickets on the floor.
“ My word ! ” agreed Swino ; “ it’s a shame the
way people treat them tickets. Good paper,
good printin’ an’ pretty pictures, an’ near every-
body chucks ’em in the gutter. I reckon it sup
ter fellers in the service ter stop this here sacri-
ligous waste.” , ,
Swino shook his head sadly. “ But they s
nothin’in the game,” he said, “since this here
prize-givin’ for tram tickets come in. They all
thinks they’s gointer git a free suit o’ clothes, an
they pack ’em up inter their pockets every time.
Then there’s the crowd out lookin’ for them. Ihe
other day a bloke got on with six girls—seven
three-section tickets—one and nine. When he
got out he chucked ’em on the floor as clean as
when he got ’em. I made for where he was sit-
ting ; but jest as I got ter the door a damn lad
chipped in on the other side an’ closed on the lot.
I didn’t say a word ter him at all.”
“ Aw,” said Ginger, sympathetically.
“ Aw,” assented the Omelet.
The Sons of Rest relapsed into a dejected
silence.

The Devil’s Bride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
GOD’S fire has sunk to its nightly rest,
Drowned in the nightly sea ;
And the bird has flown to her swaying
nest,
High in the lone, dark tree ;
And the whole wide world, from east to west,
Is left to the Devil and me.
The full moon winks through a fleecy cloud,
And the soft night scents are blown ;
And the warm, brown earth is breathing loud
Where the poppy’s wealth is strown ;
And a moment, far from the cringing crowd,
I hold the Devil my own.
All day long in the dust and heat
He has wandered up and down ;
Never a pause for his restless feet
By hamlet, farm and town ;
But alone in the dark his eyes are sweet,
And a kiss can chase his frown.
Strong, strong arms that are round me cast,
Hot breath that stirs my hair ;
He who has known the first and last
Can stoop to find me fair,
And my trembling strength can hold him fast
Who the wrath of Heaven would dare.
Black is the pit, and hot the fire,
And the nights of joy will flee,
And the thievish years will rob desire
Of all that is sweet to me ;
But what care I for the thorn and briar
Who have sat on the Devil's knee !
Though the wrath of Heayen pursue him still,
With all of peace denied,
A slave to his mighty restless will
Wandering far and wide,
It is mine to comfort the Lord of 111,
I reign as the Devil’s bride !
A moment here in the shining gloom,
Then forth to his labor vain,
Treading the path of endless doom
By w'ays of wrath and pain,
But something of Heaven’s olden bloom
Have I brought to his cheek again.
Gone ! He is gone, and our hour is done,
The moon swings low to the west,
A cycle of newer tasks begun
In his toil that knows no rest—
Surely he fought with God and won
For that dear pain in my breast !

“? | COME to me,” said Constable Pickins,

“An’ phwat did you say, Pick?” inquired
Senior-Constable Hogan from behind the watch-
house counter.
“ I told ’im to get out. ‘ I don’t care,’ says I,
‘if you’re Weekly of the Trombone,’ I says.
‘ Yous keep away,’ I says.”
“ An’ he kep’ ?”
“’E did. Was I goin’ to be bustled be a
b’oomin’ reporter?”
“ Befure you are wan noondhred an’ twinty
years in the ser-rvice, loike me,” said Hogan,
gravely, “ an' a senior, ye’ll hav bin bustled be
dozens av ’em. An’ ye’ll thin hov larnt to be bustled
be ’em widout givin’ thim slack. This Daley’s a
good frind to us John Plops, me son. An, be
the same token, he’s a good frind to Inspicthor
McNab, an’ if you don’t get gyp f’r this noight’s
repar-rtee ye’ve bin tell in’ me, Terence Hogan
don’t know nawthin’ about the reporthers.”
“’E carn’t ’arm me,” said Pickins.
“He can’t, can’t he? Have you niver bin
into a pub dhrinkin’ wid yure unifor-rum on ?
Have you niver hit a paceful dhrunk widout anny
more raison than to show yure authority ? Have
you niver bin shtandin’ f’r half-an-hour or so pur-
suin’ airy badinage wid a noice-lookin’ nyrnp doo
pave (as the French call ’em) whin you should
have bin paddin’ round yure bate ? If you have
done none av these t’ings, no—the reporthers
can’t hurt you. Bar mentionin’ you to the super-
intindent wance a week f’r bein’ insultin’ to thim,
or f’r usin’ bad language, or f’r bein’ overbearin’
wid the public. Me son, it pays anny of us Johns
to be civil to the press. Whether you do yure
duty or fail in ut, the press can help you or harm
you accordin’ as you git on well wid it or not.
Moind thot —an’ paste it in yure helmut.
“Did you iver hear the shtory av Looey
Pong's opium hell ? You did not ? Well, listen
to me, thin, an’ you’ll see how bad it is to quar'l
wid the newspaper bhoys.
“Befure this city become good, an’ the yellow
por-rtion av th’ whoite man’s burthen was forbid
be a woise law to smoke thimsilves to deat’ wid
opium, the opium dens was the shtaple industhry
av Lilly Buk, an’ the plain-clothes min was kep’
busy escoortin’ par-rties av curiosity-hunthers av
hot’ sexes t’rough th’ tents av Kwang. And some
shmall e-molument shtuck to th’ fingers av the
escoort, becas most av’ th’ pilgrims were pro-
vided wid more bunce than brains. Let you
an’ Oi, Pick, considher the feelin’s av the
Kwangs not at all, havin’ their domestic
arrangements (consistin’ mainly av opium-poipes
an’ whoite gurruls) paraded to make a globe-
trotter’s holiday. F’r it is an accepted axiom in
the polace foorce thot Kwangs haven't got anny
feelin’s av thot koind. If they have, ut’s loike
their Asian impidence, annyway.
“But a cry wint t’rough Aigypt, and a
spasm av virtue enthered into th’ fat heads av our
legislathors, and the Kwangs’ shmoke become ‘ a
prohibited impoort, to wit, opium,’ an’ there was
sorry an’ wailin’ in the land av Kwang. An’ the
plain-clothes polace, from bein’ the friends av the
yellow heathen, become his bittherest foe, an’
raided him wid disgustin’ fraquency, an’ took his
poipes an’ his opium. An’ the magisthrates foined
him loike the very divil. But, wor-rst av all,
whoite gurruls become scarce among the Chows,
fr it was mostly the opium thot drew thim to
Asia, and not the charrums of Asia itself.
Kwang kapes beer now, be th’ way, an’ the
gurruls are rallyin’ round him again. " Yes, the
grief of John Choinyman was bitther, but bit-
therest av all was the anguish av the curiosity-
hunthers. A long-felt want had been suddenly
manufactured f’r thim.
“Now, Pick, Oi am goin’ to let you into a
sacret —there are bad polacemen an' good wans.
A WASTED EFFORT.
MAUD (apprehensively): “Do you think there are any men about to see us in these costumes ? ”
MABEL: “ I'm afraid not.”
So, afther this, niver be surproised if you meet a
good wan. But Plain-clothes Constable McGurk
would niver have surproised you, Pick. McGurk
did ahl th’ Pings you do—an’ a good few you
haven’t larnt yet. F’r he had opportunities
which you, me son, have not yet had. An’ at
th’ toime Oi shpake of he had a terrace av cot-
tages ahl let to good tenants in Collingwood, an’
he t’ought he saw his way to make some additions
to his own villa residence in Toorak be manes of
this new law.
“ Looey Pong, as you may guess be his name,
was a Kwang. He, loike McGurk, saw th’ possi-
bilities av the new law in the way av oof-manu-
facture. Oi don’t know whither McGurk sug-
gested these wicked oideas to Pong, or Pong
brathed thim to McGurk. Pong had some in-
tilligence an’ no morals, whoile McGurk had no
morals an’ no intelligence. So the odds are on
Pong. Each av thim shwore ut was th’ other
at the inquoiry. The only commandment ayther
Porg or McGurk knew was the same wan that so
rnanny, manny churchgoers kape th’ most careful
av ahl—-the eliventh, Pick.
“Soon afther the passing of the Act, pretty
well all the dens was closed. Thim as wasn’t was
hid careful from the pryin’ gaze of polace an’
visitors aloike. Ye had to knock in a certain way
at th’ dure, an’ whisper a certain Choinase cur-rse.
Thin th’ dure would open, be manes av an ingani-
ous conthrivance av shtring an’ pulleys conthrolled
from th’ shmokin’-room. You enthered, an’ found
yuresilf up against a barbed-woire entanglement,
wid the loight av a bull’s-eye lantern in yure face,
whoile fr’m fourteen holes in th’ walls an’ ceilin’
the eyes av th’ Kwangs gazed at yure liniments.
Av you was a wilcome guest th’ bar-rbed-vvoire
entanglemint would disappear, three boiler-plate
dures would open befure yure onward path, an’
you was admitted into the holy av holies. If the
Kwangs didn’t loike th’ look av ye, somet’ing hit
you on the head, an’ you woke up on th’ pavemint
in th’ next lane wid a polaceman searchin’ yure
pockuts prior to takin’ you to the watch-house.
An ’av course ahl this concalemint an’ mystery
atthracted th’ silly fools an’ they loiked slummin’
harder than iver. The slummers were willin’
to pay big money for to observe John Choinyman
in his native stink, makin’ a fool av himself sur-
rounded be th’ evidences av his depraved an’
hathen habuts. But Kwang had enthrenched
himsilf so well thot the plain-clothes men couldn’t
get th’ money. None av thim, that is, excep’
Tim McGurk.
“F’r Tim had fixed it all up wid Pong. Pong
furnished th’ top back room av his abode wid
Orienthal luxury, said luxury includin’ some chape
Jap screens, stretchers, an’ opium poipes. Th’
noights Tim’d be bringin’ a par-rty av soight-
seers to the hells av Lilly Buk he’d tip Pong the
wink, and Pong would bring in a couple av
women, fill ’em wid beer, an’ lay ’em on the
stretchers wid poipes in their hands, phwere they
impersonated victims av the Black Smoke—instid
av the yeller beer. Now, moind you, be the
terms av his conthract wid Tim, Pong was not
allowed to shmoke opium. But all the same Tim
McGurk used to admoire what an excellent imita-
tion av that same was the smell in Pong’s smokin’-
saloon. Annyway, ’twasn’t Pr him to complain.
The slummers paid their money to him and Pong,
an’ ahl wint merry as a muffin-bell.
‘‘Now Tim, be raison av his rapidly accumu-
latin’ bank-account, put on more dog than manny
an inspecthor. He swelled round in a silk vest
an’ tie av a chaste vermilion and yellow hue, till
ye’d have took him Pr a plain-clothes constable—
which he was—an’ his manners grew worse an’
worse. Until, in the inivitable coorse av t’ings,
he forgot one av the two main precep’s av loife—
niver lave th’ red over the pockut an’ be civil to
the reporthers. It was the second wan he fell
down on. Pie got saucy wid a felly named Wal-
ters, who used to do th’ rounds Pr the Echo. Oi
forgit phwat ut was ahl about, but Walters, who
was a quoiet, dacint little felley, tould me, hangin’
over that very counter, thot he was goin’ to get
McGurk ayther kicked out av the foovce or shifted
up counthry. Oi laughed.
“‘ Ye can’t do ut,’says Oi. Ye see, Oi was
loike you in thim days. Oi didn’t know how
much thim reporthers know.
“‘Bet you dhrinks,’ said Walters, ‘McGurk
only lasts three months more in this city.’
“ ‘ Done ! ’ says Oi, an’ forgot ahl about ut.
“ Now McGurk hadn’t only offended Wal-
ters. There was a yoong detective here at the
toime thot had his knoife into Tim, an’ bein’ a
fool, Tim didn’t know ut. An’ this detective—
Bean his name was—was as thick as thaves wid
Walters. Both av thim was waitin’ Pr Tim, an’
fra couple av weeks they hunted him together.
“Wan mornin’ Tim got a letther fr’m a well-
known an’ respected (be iverybody but his woife)
resident av Toorak. Misther Toorak asked Tim
to take him, next noight, wid two lady frinds—
acthresses fr’m England—to see Choinytown.
Enclosed was a cheque Pr t’ree pound. Tim
banked th’cheque, an’ wrote back sayin’where
he'd meet th’ par-rty.
“ Misther Toorak tur-rned up ahl might wid
his two ladies, an’ wan av thim was a simple,
trustin’ little t’ing, an’ hung on to Tim's ar-rum
wid terror whin anny Ivwang passed, an’ said how
brave polacemen must be to go ivery noight into
terr’ble places loike Lilly Buk. An’ befure th’
avenin’ was out Tim’s ar-rum was round her
whiniver they come to a dark place, an’ he’d made
a date wid her f r next noight. He took thim
into the pak-ah-pu shop where they mar-rked
tickuts in th’ lotthery, into the cook-shops where
they ate long soup an’ boned duck an’ chop sooev ;
an thin, as a woind up, to Looey Pong’s opium
hell. Whin th’ girruls got to the joint they was
terr’ble shocked at furrust be the degradation av
whoite women livin' wid the Kwangs, but Pon<*
explained to thim that the women was perfeckly
respectable, wan bein’ his wife an’ the other bein’
married to Wun Lung, who was suckin’ an opium
poipe in a cor-rner. So they bucked up a bit
whoile Pong showed thim how opium was
shmoked. Thin nawthin’ would plase the little
gurrul but Pong would sell her just a little opium
as a curiosity. Tim, who would have bought th’
whole shop Pr her, got her a little tortoise-shell
box av the stuff. He noticed that it was th’ rale
t’ing, too, but couldn't say annvt’ing to Pong at
th’ toime. Tim asked her wouldn’t she rather
have a poipe, but she said no—it was too big, an’
smelt too slhrong.
“ Th’ next mornin’ the Echo come out wid a
column av real hot stuff, headed ‘ Looey Pong’s
Joint ’ ; ‘ Police Corruption ’; ‘ Constable
Exploits Vice.’ Th’ ar-rticle wint on to inforrum
the public that, at number twinty-foive, Canton
Alley, an opium-joint was bein’ run be one Looey
Pong, a cabinet-maker an’ a sinner ; that a well-
known plain-clothes constable visited it regu-
larly with parties of sightseers, who paid him for
taking them to see Chinatown ; an’ that if the
polace authorities wished for proof that opium
was shmoked on the primises, they moight call at
the Echo office an take charge av a shmall box
av opium, took fr’m th’ joint in very peculiar
circumstances, which would be related next day.
“ Tim McGurk was pretty noigh frantic. He
talked about loibel. ‘ Begod,’ says he, ‘ ’twas a
dhirty thrick fra paper to send round a man wid
two faymale reporthers to thrap me loike thot.
But Oi’ll pull through ahl roight, an’ thin watch
me shtick th’ dahm rag Pr damages.’
“ A detective sargint wint down to th’ Echo
office an’ got th’ box.av opium, an 1 in the avenin’
he spint an’ hour wid Walters an’ Bean in wan av
the big city hotels. They talked very quoiet to-
gether, but when they left th’ place th’ sargint
was faint wid laughter.
“ ‘ Don’t say anny more, bhoys,’ he says, ‘ I’m
sore in the soides. Annywav, th’ inquoiry’s fixed
f’r next Thursday.’
“ ‘ Right,’ says Walters. ‘ Not a word to the
Clarion though.’ When you know reporthers
betther, Pick, you will undherstan’ phwat they
mane be 1 follerin’ up a scoop.’
“There ain't much more to tell. Tim sailed
up to th’ inquoiry wid a foine shtory he had in-
vinted. He breathed quite easy when he see
thot nayther the rnahn fr’m Toorak nor the two
acthresses was in th’ room. Bean an’ Walters
was there, an’ they grinned cheerfully across at
him. Thin both av thim give their evidence —
how, on the noight of June twinty-one, they
accompanied the accused to a house kep’ be one
Looey Pong—an’ ahl th’ rest av lit. There was,
they said, another man present, but they thought
that the Inspecting Superintendent would rely
upon their evidence. Walters produced the
little tortoise-shell box of opium, which, he said,
had been bought from the Choinyman be McGurk.
“Tim not seein’ aven thin how matthers was,
pladed guilty to havin’ taken a gintleman fr’m
Toorak an’ two yoong ladies round that noight.
He declared thot he had recaved no money Pr
doin’ so, an’ thot he hadn’t bought th’ opium fr'm
Pong. He called Pong as a witness, and Pong
shwore, afther blowin’ out two matches, thot he
hadn’t sold th’ opium. Tim thin asked thot the
gintleman fr’m Toorak should be projuced as a
witness. He said thot Walters was prooceedin’,
through malice, to roon him.
“ ‘ Betther call th’ yoong women,’ says the
superintendent.
“‘ Oi don’t know where they are,’ says
McGurk.
“ ‘ Oi f rgot to state, sorr,’ said Bean, ‘ thot me
an’ Mr. Walters were disguised as yoong Eng-
lish acthresses.’
“ ‘ Yis,’ says Walters, ‘an’ the liberthies
McGurk took wid Mr. Bean was outrageous. He
called him “ Birdie,” an’ thried to kiss him.’
“ ‘ An’, be the way,’ says Bean, careless-loike,
‘Oi have here a cheque, sorr, payable to Con-
stable Timothy McGurk and drawn by Charles
Branxome. That cheque was, I can bring evi-
dence to prove, unless McGurk saves us
trouble by pleading guilty, received by him on the
morning of the twinty-second, an’ paid into his
account during the afternoon. Here also is a
letther, signed be him, agreein’ to take the parthy
round. An’ av you want anny particulars av an
appointmint he made wid me Pr the next avenin',
or av all th’ noice t’ings he said —an’ him a
married mahn '
“ ‘ Oi plade guilty,’ says Tim, suddenly.
“ ’Tis as well,’ says the superintendent.
“ ‘An’ Oi tender my resignation,’ says Tim.
“ ‘An’ Oi won’t accept ut,’ says the superinten-
dent. ‘ Ut’s loike yure dahm impertinence. If
you go out av this foorce you go wid the toe-
mark on vur back —plain Pr all honest men to
see. Resignation ! Afther makin’ a fool of the
foorce wid yure dahm silly knavery. To Hell
out av this, whoile Oi considher the matther.’
“The ind av ut was thot, considherin Tim’s
pravious good record—he’d niver been found out
befure —the sintince av th’ coort av inquiry was
Pr a rural loife, an’ not th’ boot. So Tim wint
up to Bullagong to learn some av the Ten Com-
mandments, havin’ made a mess av th’ Eliventh.
An’ on th’ noight av his departure Walters
dhropped in here at the watch-house.
“‘Hogan,’ he says, ‘thim dhrinks are on
you. ’ ”

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
T^OOD-night, little woman! The moon she is low;
The grey light is growing to eastward, and so
It is time for a lover to saddle and go.
Good-night, little woman! The stars in
the sky
Are drozvsily watching and zvondering why
We are waiting so late at the gate, you and I.
Good-night, little woman! Ah! Closer,
and cling!
See! The march of the morning, grey
banners a-szving,
And the sunbeams will soon be abroad on
the zving.
Good-bye, little lover! With curtains un-
drawn
The rosy day leaps from her couch to the
lawn,
And the scent of dead roses comes in with
the dawn.
Good-bye, little lover ! Ah ! Cruel is Fate.
Alone at the window I watch and I wait,
It is only my heart holds your hand at the
gate.

My Friend the Critic.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I SAW my friend the Critic in his room the
other day,
Far from gay ;
His eyes were dull, and faded was his cheek,
So to speak,
But he welcomed me politely in his pleasant pur-
ring way,
Though his voice it was pathetically weak.
A pile of books before him stood—smart volumes
fresh and new,
For review ;
I thought of lambs for slaughter, meek and
mild,
And I smiled,
For he did not seem the kind of man, just then,
to hack and hew
Hapless authors ; he looked harmless as a child.
He said, “ Pray make yourself at home—you
know just where you are !
In the jar
There’s whisky which, alas, I cannot drink,
And, I think,
In that box upon the mantelpiece you'll find a
good cigar ;
Let me see you smoke and hear your beaker
clink !
“I’m sick,” he sighed, “and full of pills and
draughts as 1 can hold.
It’s a cold
That’s got me, and my nerves are all unstrung,
And my tongue
Is unfit for publication. I believe I’m growing
old —
Though I never was at any time too young.”
I watched him as he read a book ; the brain I
thought severe,
And austere,
Appeared to be affected in strange ways
By a phrase ;
And I saw' him make a pencil-mark where’er he
dropped a tear,
As if he were noting passages to praise.
I thought “ This man is human ; he has feelings
of his own ;
He’s no stone ;
Emotion has not been to him denied
In full tide.”
And I said, “ That book has touched you. Is it
by an author know n ? ”
Then he looked at me, and drearily replied :
“ It’s besotted rot and drivel —it’s the bleating of
a sheep
Full of cheap
False pathos—it's a yellow-covered yell
Made to sell.
Yet w'hen I’m sick it’s trash like this that alw'ays
makes me weep—
But I mark it to be slaughtered when I’m well.”
I thought about the legend of the W'eeping croco-
dile
On the Nile,
Who mourned because his victims had to glide
Him inside ;
And I w'atched my friend the Critic with serene
amusement, wdiile
He made pencil-marks, and copiously cried.
CREEVE ROE.
“SordriN Flude.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ IT AVE a pot of tea, mate. Sorry I haven’t
anythin’ else to offer yer, but since the
sordrin flude racket my missus is es-
trordrinly suspicious, not trustin’ er own lawful
husband to purchis anything in the liquid line
without nosin’ roun’ to make certin’ it’s the k’rekt
article, smelling the harness oil and sniffin’ into
the embrocation bottle, and all that.
“ It was this w'ay. One day lars’ summer—it
was too hot to think of working—l w'as lyin’ on
the v randah smokin’ and dozin,’ w’en the missus,
who W'as out at the back choppin’ up a bit of
wood for the boiler fire—she was washin'—comes
roun’ and disturbs me jes’ as I w'as droppin’ orf,
an’ ses, ‘ Them there karasine tins is all leakin’
so’s I can’t boil nothin’ in ’em. Can't yer fix
’em ? ’
“Yer may persoom I was ernoved at being
roused like that, more p’ticulerly to drag meself
inter the sun and tinker roun’ them pots. So I
ses short-like, ‘ Ain’t got no sordrin iron. Can’t
yer stick a bit of rag in the holes or soap ’em up
like they w'as before?’ An’ she ses, ‘No, the
holes has got too big ! ’
“ I was jes’ puttin’ me head down agen w’en
she ses, ‘ Can’t yer borrer an iron from Healy at
the store ?' You know Healy w’ot keeps the store
and pub dowm the crick about half a mile. I
knew Healy had a sordrin iron, but it W'as too
hot to tramp dowm there for one, ’specially as I

PARTLY ILLUSTRATING OUR LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER'S LIBRARY.
parsonimonius, ’cept for tucker and such, and
Healy had drew a line under my score on the
slate. So I tells her Healy’s iron had been
shook. She arsks me how much they corst, an’
I, bein’ took unawares like, ses a bob. So she
goes to her secret hoard of my earnin’s —w’ich I
have spent many fruitless hours tryin’ to discover
—and w’en she comes back gives me a bob to get
one.
“ I was so knocked aback, so to speak, that I
felt good and strong enough to walk down to
Healy’s and have a couple of recooperators with
the bob and borrer the iron. So when the
missus had brought me hat I started.
“ On the way I rumernated on the possibilities
of that bob. It might go straight in two drinks
for meself —one w’en I got there an’ one before I
lef’. Or it might last out the day if there was a
few fellers there an’ I was lucky. Then I could
go home in the cool of the evenin’ an’ do the
sordrin next day.
“ Howsomever, w’en I got to Healy’s there
wasn’t a soul about but old Scotty, sittin’ on the
pub v’randah wide awake, so I knew he was both
thirsty an’ broke. I accordin’ly went into the
store first an’ arst the price of separators, an’ then
got Mrs. Healy to give me two sixpences for the
shillin’, tellin’ her I wanted to give an old feller
somethin’ but couldn’t afford a bob. She grinned
sakarstic like as she guv me them.
“I then went to the pub with a sixpence in
each side pocket, an’ ses, ‘ Hello, Scotty ; how is
it?’ He ses, ‘ Continued dry condition, set stiff.
D’ye think there’s likely to be a moist wave ? ’ I
tells him that I only had the price of one, an’
turns me pocket out to prove it. I goes into the
bar and asks Ilealy f’r a rum, showin’ him the
sixpence to avoid any sakarstickness on his part.
W’ile I was drinkin’ I remembers about the sor-
drin iron and asks for the loan of his. ‘ Yers,’ he
ses ; ‘ orright, yer’ll find it stuck in the post of
the hen house f’r a door-jamb.’
“As I was goin’ back with the sordrin iron
orl at onst I rec'lected that I wanted sordrin-
flude too.- I could melt sorder from old jam-tins.
So, w’en I got back to the bar I asked Healy if
he had any, and would he lend me a drop. ‘ I
have some,’ he ses, ‘ but I don’t lend it. I sell
it.’ ‘Will yer put it down ter my account ? ’ I
ses. ‘No,’ he ses ; ‘I won’t. You get no more
credit here till yer square up.’ I thought of me
sixpence and me lorst chance of another rum, but
I knew what it would be to face the missus with-
out the flude, so after trying all I knew to get it
on strap, I manfully planked down me sixpence
and tole Healy to give me sixpennorth. ‘ Right,’
he ses.
“ Blarst me if he didn’t reach down the very
same bottle that he just before guv me a nip out
of. ‘ Yer’ve made a mistake,’ 1 calls out.
‘That’s rum.’ ‘No mistake,’ ses he. ‘Allow
me to know wot’s in me own bar. This stuff is
special and guaranteed to ack both ways. I ort
to know, c’nsiderin’ I made it. Jes’ yer brush
that on wot yer goin’ to sorder an’ yer’ll find the
sorder’ll take orright. ’ I was very doobious about
it, but took his word an’ the flude an’ the iron
and come home.
“ Well, that afternoon, after a bit of a rest, I
set to work on them tins. I done a hole in one
an’ then got a sniff of the hot flude from it. It
smelt good. I touched my tongue with it. It
tasted better. Then I did another tin, an’ tasted
the flude agen. Then I had a rest and another
taste of flude, an’ started on the third tin, w’en,
to my surprise, the flude had spilt or evaporated
or somethin’.
“ The missus wakes me at tea-time with the
broom, an’ ses I was drunk and stunk of rum. I
assured her it was the fumes of the hot flude wot
overcome me, and showed her the tins I had done.
She b’lieved me and guv me a small—very small
—drop of brandy from her medsin chest, which
she keeps locked most times.
“ Well, nex’ day I offers to finish the tins, an’
she guv me sixpence to get more flude. I got it
an’ done two more tins, w’en the flude agen
evaporated an’ I was agen overcome. This w r ent
on f r a few r days, till one evenin , she bein’ idle,
having finished churning, fed the pigs and calves
and kids, chopped a bit of wood f r the mornin’,
an’ cut the horse's chaff, and left me to put up
the sliprails wot I forgot to put up w’en I come
home, sot dowm an’ watched me workin’. She
stayed there till I finished an’ put the things away,
flude an’ all. Nex’ mornin’ the flude bottle was
found lyin’ on its side empty with the cork
out. The cat had done it. The bottle was
labelled ‘ Sordrin Flude ; Poisnus.’
“ All the tins bein’ now mended, the missus
could have done her washin’ an’ churnin' an’ cetra
singin’ like a butcher bird, but she didn t. She
alw’ays seemed to be thinkin .
“ There bein’ now no more sordrin to do I
didn’t have to get no more flude, an’ the tins
seemed to be everlarstin'. So w’en the missus
would be churnin’ or doin’ anythin that made a
noise I’d help ’em a bit with an ole file, an at
last got an odd job now an’ agen, the flude
gettin’ lorst by evaporation, an’ cats, hens, kids
an’ all manner of ways posserble. Sometimes
native bears took it. I useter think sometimes
w’en I esplained these things to the missus that
she smole at me sort of quiet-like, but she never
sed nothin’.
“ Anyhow, at larst she had to go down to
Bundaberg f r family reasons —that’s them there
chewin' the corn cobs —an’ before she sets out I
purposes to her that in her absince I would give
orl the karasine tins, milk dishes, billies, buckets
and all the pots, pans, kittles, an’ even the tank
a thorough overhaul and sorder everything that
had a hole or was likely to have for six months,
so as w’en she returned everythin’ would be so
that the washin’an’ the churnin’, an’ so on, would
do themselves with jes’ her suprintendance. But
she on’y smiles quiet-like, an’ ses she don t think
there’s no necesserty f’r all that trouble, nor f r me
to endanger me health with them horrid fumes
from the flude.
“ I tried to pursuade her that the work was
very necessery—that it was on’y her ease I was
c’nsidrin’, an’ that my health would be in no
danger, me being, as it were, immune from the
effects of the noxyus fumes now, having been, so
to speak, innocerlatid. I added that a pound’s
worth of flude would more than do the lot. She
jes’ smole, an’, lookin’ me straight in the eye,
ses, very quiet-like: ‘ I think with a pound’s
worth of that flude yer wouldn’t finish a pannikin.’
I ain’t figured out yet wot she meant by them
words, nor how she calculates it, an’ I don’t care
to arst her, cos them quiet-like answers of hers
always seem to have somethin’ behind ’em.
“Anyway, she goes away without letting me
have it; so I had nothin’ to do w’ile she was
away but get the corn an’ lucerne in.
“ Well, at larst she comes back, an’ nsx’ day
we unpacked the stores she brought from town
with her. On opening one very heavy case I sees
a row of bottles, an’ smiles, knowin’ it was a
present fr me. I lifted a bottle out to see the
brand, and reads : ‘ Sordrin Flude. Non-
poisonous. Guaranteed free from noxious fumes.’
I gently put that bottle back in the case. There
was a dozen in it. Then I turns an’ meets the
missus smilin’ quiet-like in the doorway. Ses
she : ‘ I hope you like your present, dear. You
won’t any more have to tramp that long half mile
for flude on hot days, or be overcome by the
fumes while using it.’
“ That’s why I can only offer ver tea, an' why
the missus is so p ticlar wot fludes I keep about
the place.”

The Church Sartorial.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The point of the whole matter was that in India, in
' China, in the South Sea Islands, the people could live in
accordance with the rules of their religion, and at the
same time live lives of srross immorality. The only way
of introducing moral modes of life was through Chris-
tianity. . . . Chinas only hope lay in its conversion to
the Christian religion.— Sydney Daily Paper.
The Bishop pontificated at the Choral Eucharist at 11
a.in., vested in a handsome cope and mitre, and wearing
the jewelled pectoral cross which was presented to him
by the parishioners.— Same Paper.
Lord, how the Heathen rage together !
“ Grossly immoral”—joyous—nude—
Barring a bead or, perchance, a feather—
fegblind to Christian beatitude ;
Looking at Life with eyesight blurred ;
Ignorant of the ber-lessed Word !
“ India and China and all the Islands ”
Still nine fathoms below the abysm ! . . .
We, glad Christians, roaming the highlands
Carolling gaily our catechism ! . . .
Sharp as the contrast of Day with Night—
Som.ehow, it doesn't seem wholly right.
What shall be done to reach and save them ?
How can we yank them up Above ?
First, we must catch them, scrape them, shave
them—
Speaking, the while, of faith and love—
Wean them from habits half-arboreal,
Make them &ne with the Church Sartorial.
Once, in the good, old days departed,
Cruder methods were tried, and failed ;
If the Heathen were stony-hearted,
Frequently they were fined and gaoled.
Those who showed prolonged effrontr’y
Got a (burning) Stake in the Country.
Yet the good work made slow progression ;
Rivers of years have ebbed and flowed ;
Still the Heathen, through some obsession,
Shies away from the Heavenly Road-
Yea ! though warned he must meet his Judge,
Obstinately he declines to budge.
Force, alas ! is gone out of fashion ;
Argument raises a heathen smile ;
Then Thy servants get in a passion,
And beat the Heathen, once in a while ;
We preach him the Simple and Moral Life,
But he still hangs on to his Plural Wife !
Wherefore, now it is come to this:
If we are to make the Heathen moral,
And spread the Gospel of Future Bliss
Though Cathay and the Isles of Coral,
Our total failure we must confess
With all known methods —excepting Dress !
With Dress, O Lord, perchance we may yet
Defy the Heathen in all his rage
And lead him unto the Higher Way yet,
And all his carnal fears assuage—
Could there be doughtier Gospel-smiter
Than a Bishop dressed in his cope and mitre ?

The New Sky-scrapers of Sydney and the
Repair of Boggs Alley.
The Works Committee has recommended to the Cit.y
Council that the whole of the Balfonr-street area, as
submitted by the city surveyor, should be resumed. It
was also recommended that the locality about Systrum-
lane be remodelled. —News item, in Sydney paper.
The Duke-street resumption has been approved by the
Council.— Dit to.
The widening of Oxford-street is progressing rapidly.
—Ditto.
And there are many other such items in the
Sydney papers these leaping days of progress.
Around Chippendale and Wexford-street and
Athlone-place and Camperdown there is a stir-
ring of the muddy and ill-ventilated bones such
as old Sydney never knew before. Cheap out-
lying places are being remodelled on no connected
plan, but just one here and one there and one
in the other direction. But meanwhile the Big
Job —the absolutely necessary remodelling of the
city itself—is being shirked because it is so ap-
pallingly big that the municipal fathers stand
aghast when they look at it, and the Legislature
feels a sinking at the pit of the stomach when the
thing is mentioned. It is just possible that
Greater Sydney, if there was such a place, might
pay the money on the long instalment plan, but
the small area ruled by the Sydney City Council
would find the bill for its own rebuilding a fear-
some affair. So little or nothing is being done
with the tangled and unhandy business centre,
barring the fact that a few yards of George-street
have been widened, and left as crooked as a ram’s
horn. And every day the prospective expense
grows more alarming. All the improvements
which are being made in the reconstruction of
outlying slums tend to make more business
for the city. The creation of new suburbs is
going on apace —every day the announcement
appears that another desirable area is about to be
auctioned, so that the multitudinous red-tiled
cottage may go up with a whoop ; and each new
suburb involves a fresh influx of people and tram-
cars and vehicles generally. The railway dupli-
cations are a means to the same end. The
planting of the Federal capital as near as possible
to Sydney’s back door is meant to rush more
business into the same overcrowded little area.
The tearing down of old, small, decayed
office premises and their replacement by
new sky-scrapers causes iooo clerks to
scurry to and fro, by tram-car and other-
wise, where only ioo rushed previously. The
frenzied desire to shove everything—includ-
ing the business of the Federal capital, and the
trade of Monaro and Western Riverina, and the
commerce of Armidale and Tenterfield—into
Sydney is hastening in an alarming fashion the
time when the city streets will have to be made
broad and straight regardless of cost. The con-
gestion policy makes the new sky-scraper building
necessary to hold the congested business. And the
tenants of the sky-scraper increase the traffic and
make more room imperative. In fact, almost every
sky-scraper that goes up only means another one
to l. repurchased and pulled down in the recon-
struction days, and the more of them that go up
the sooner they will have to come down. Also,
the more of them that go up, the more will have
to be paid for them when they come down, for each
one adds to the invoice for unearned increment.
The congestion device, in fact, has a curious
habit of coming home to roost, like a curse or a
boomerang. It brings to the city, at great, need-
less cost over great, needless distances, more
trade, more overcrowding, more need of haste in
laying out the ill-constructed place anew. Also, it
makes the new laying-out so much more ruinous
that the wrongfully-acquired trade may easily cost
more than it was worth. The problem is one
which can’t be solved by taking drastic measures
wdth Boggs Alley in Woolloomooloo, however
badly Boggs Alley may require them. Boggs
Alley, in fact, is only a salve to the public con-
science, a device for shirking the real question,
and an excuse for putting off the evil day.

“Geof.”: The country has its own ideas
of a joke. Passing through Berry (N.S.W.) last
week, I saw the publican’s cow wandering the
streets with the battle-cry of the Judites—“ Vote
no license ” —painted across its hindquarters.
The whisky-seller who owned the cow swears that
for three days, as a solid protest, the enraged
animal gave one bucketful of sour milk per day.
Either the same or some other joker, to even
matters up, painted the local parson’s horse with
“ Vote continuance.’’ It demoralised the nag,
which is now doing 14 days for “drunk and
disorderly.”
This is how the expert in Fiji puts it :
Professor T. L. of, Francokur, sole proprietor of the
Suva Funeral Parlors, takes this opportunity to return
his sincere thanks to his numerous customers and friends
for their kind patronage in their unfortunate time of
mourning, through the removal from this world of some
of their relatives and friends by the Almighty’s calling.
And would beg to notify them, and the public in
general of Fiji, that he has enlarged his business place so
that he is now in a much better position to undertake and
carry out all classes of pompe funebre, high-class funerals
in the most clean, respectable and up-to-date methods.
Anyone doubting my word in any respect whatever
has a perfect privilege to come at any time and inspect
my goods.
One beautiful IMMORTAL FRENCH WREATH is given
FREE with all Caskets of £7 10s. and all coffins of
£6 to £3 10s.
Anyone, white or colored people, losing one of their
family by death and who are too poor to pay for a coffin,
and are able to satisfy me that they are respectable and
worthy people, I will give them a coffin free to bury their
dead.
N.B.—Beware of bogus and hypocrite agents.
The time is coming when coupons will be given
away with each coffin, and the advertisement
of Pall, Bones and Co., Ltd., will read some-
thing like this :
Pali,, Bones and Co., Ltd., desire to inform those
meditating a trip to Wormville that the company’s high-
class line of coaches are specially fitted for the public’s
convenience. Quick trips and no returns is the co.’s
motto. Each passenger will be handed a coupon on dis-
embarking which will entitle the holder on presentation
to one of our handsome French respirators. Further,
every 20th lady or gentleman occupying one of our satin-
lined, velvet-frilled, nickel-handled berths will be per-
sonally conducted over the Grand Tour free of cost. Get
nominated to-day. Every man is the architect of his own
funeral, and a good beginning makes a good ending.
“ Horatio Breathless ” makes a few hur-
ried remarks about wireless and the oldest in-
habitant :—■
The stirring fact that a wireless mast has just been
erected on the roof of The Bulletin office brings home to
me the fact that we are moving faster than ever, and that
the oldest inhabitant of to-day is having a hotter time
than the oldest inhabitant of yesterday; also, that the
oldest inhabitant of to-morrow will have such a fiendishly
hot time that he will probably have to be fitted with a
patent water-jacket like a quick-firing gun to keep him
from bursting and severely injuring whatever links with
the past are hanging on to him at the moment. (In case the
above reference to links should be mistaken for an insult,
I hasten to point out that, whenever an aged resident
goes to his last rest, the morning paper invariably re-
marks in a mournful manner that “ another link with the
past has been severed”; and, so far, no relative of the
deceased patriarch has rebuked the editor with a length
of ship’s cable.) Twenty-five years ago the oldest inhabi-
tant had only to climb on a leisurely ’bus. To-day he
has to make a tottering dash for a whizzing electric tram
that rings madly if it is delayed at a crossing two seconds
over its time. To-morrow he will have to leap for an air-
ship, and as his capacity for leaping is limited, he will,
more often than not, miss the swinging rope ladder,
and land heavily on his thicket of whiskers.
This sort of .violence will wear him out before his
time, and oldest inhabitants will become so rare
that the survivors of the species will be hired
at immense salaries by the proprietors of waxworks
and be able to afford private air-cruisers. At the
present time, everywhere I go, I hear old people and
people who are getting old complaining bitterly of the
way they are hunted and bustled by porters, tram-
conductors, policemen, relations, solicitors, deck-hands,
children, neighbors, tradesmen and undertakers. They
say they can get no rest at all ; that where they used to
walk they now have to run, and where they used to run
they now have to go like the Devil—or as like him as
possible. Naturally enough, they feel the strain of it,
and keep looking back over their shoulders as they go, to
see whose fault it is. Of course it is nobody’s fault in
particular—it is merely the incurable defect of the times.
We call the wild rush “ Progress ” ; but when somebody
asks us where we are progressing in such a hurry, none
of us seems to know.
LAST SCREAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Horrible Accident,
old man’s dying scream.
When the goods’-engine rolls o’er your chest,
When the stone from the parapet dashes,
When the old cargo-sling gives it best,
And the load on your intellect crashes,
'Tis consoling to think your last howl
Will assist some bloodhound in his mission
Of exhuming some news for the Ghoul
To put sting in the second edition.
When the boiler goes off with a bang,
When the scaffold comes down with a
clatter,
And in seventeen pieces you hang
Whilst the people below wildly scatter,
It is sweet to reflect that the yell
You emit as you perish sublimely
Is a godsend for those who must tell
How you met with your finish untimely.
Wouldst do a good turn to the Press ?
Then discard all your anticipations
Of expiring in easy undress
—Evening paper headlines.
Whilst surrounded by weeping relations l
.Hurry out and be slain in your boots,
With a scream that is horrid and final;
So the headlines may chill, as he scoots,
Ev’ry man to the marrow that’s spinal !

B. LUD.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ 0.1 i.” : The natural vanity of stage actors gees more
than its fair share of satirical comment in the press.
Why not aim a few shafts of ridicule at the swelled heads
of those other public performers, the actors in the
“ political arena,” whose vanity is fed by press notices
of a more utterly contemptible character than any that
the recognised mummers receive. I refer to the personal
pars in the dailies concerning the remark that one poli-
tician makes to another when they are having a free
drink with a third politician at some social function
or other. For instance: “During a lull in the buzz
of conversation excited by his Excellency’s speech,
Mr. Smallwit, M.H.R., remarked in an audible
tone to Senator Poorjoke that their friend Cough-
drop (of the Leg. Assembly) should be called
upon for a recitation. Mr. Poorjoke replied that Mr.
Ooughdrop was always reciting the grievances of the
Labor Party, whereupon Senator Limelight cried ‘Hear,
hear!’” This mode of advertising Parliamentary mum-
mers has developed to an insufferable degree. Talk of
actors ! Some of them are modest, unassuming creatures
compared with the average member of Parliament, who
gets 50 times more puffing than he deserves as the result
of his pertinacity in “squaring” the reporters. When
I find the awfully funny thing which Poorjoke said to
Limelight reported among the personal pars of a daily
paper, I know that the leading hero of that paragraph has
been slapping the writer on the back in a flattering
manner.
“ Jean Sibi ”: After extensive inspection of the flicker-
graph shows, I conclude that the variety is merely a
variation, slight in itself, of certain stock types of inci-
dent. I divide flicks into two primary divisions : (a)
Faked ; (5) Historical. The faked division comprises all
the arranged episodes dependent upon hired accessories
—anything from a balloon to a cardboard locomotive —
and are elaborate in detail. The Historical em-
braces faithful records of happenings that would
have occurred, even if the flickophotographer had
been absent, I subdivide the Faked into: (a) Melo-
dramatic, (6) Humorous, (c) Imaginative, (ci) Juvenile ;
and the Historical into:.(«) Artificial, ( b ) Instructive.
Now, in the Fako-Melodramatic class are the morbidly-
amorous and sensational incidents, the former depicting
such primitive things as the abduction of females, fol-
lowed by the pursuit and vengeance of a distressed lover;
the latter, exploits wherein bold, bad men are demolished
and wallow in their gore, what time a tired slaughterer
wipes his weapon on his pants. Fako-Humorous is con-
cerned with (1) frivolous love-passages between man
and woman, perhaps a shade more ridiculous than the
serious business between us and our divinities ; (2) the
invariable and rather monotonous disaster created by a
bolting traction engine or by a fool with a ladder.
In the Fako-Imaginative, you get the mechanically-
mysterious, par excellence —horses changing to mules
and tadpoles; disintegrated personalities ; disappear-
ances and reappearances, with all the wonder of demons
in pantomime. In Fako-Juvenile are included every
imaginable, mischievous and amusing escapade of the
small boy. Now, taking the Historical, we get the His-
torico-Artificial —the pageant and function —Ned VII.
opening breweries and sanatoria: reviews of troops;
swankey carnivals and such ; while, under Historico-
Instructive, come the pictured records of industries, ship-
building, timber-getting, salmon-canning; and of sport,
such as ski-jumping and ice-sailing. As said, the Films
are, in the Faked Division, limited to stock types ; but
they escape becoming hackneyed in theme, because of
continuous change of iocalitiesand accessories. And how
lucrative must be the industry of flick-making and flick-
faking! In the faked flick are employed pros, from the
theatres who appear as Virtue or Vice in the various flick
narratives ; and to this expense must be added extra ex-
penditure in the hire of localities, motor-cars and a mil-
lion things. So flick artificers prosper. They supply the
world. Flossie de Frou Frou prospers. Her profession
is that of flick actress before a world audience. Indeed,
the business embraces so many things that because of it
many new words have been added to the flickabulary.
TEMPTING.
THE SINGER (with feeling): “ Will you miss
me?”
VOICE (from back of the hall): “ Gimme a gun
and I'll try not to! ”
“ Haresfoot ” : About the worst memory on the stage
is that of Beerbohtn-Tree. He hardly seems to know
half his part the first night, although he may have been
rehearsing many weeks and half-a-dozen other actors
could take any character in the play, of which they are
so full up. In general, the bad memorisers are good
actors, and such in the past were Ireland and Stuart
O’Brien. Now, take the exceptional memories. It is
said Brooke never studied any part. All he had to' ao
was to read it over, but he was never perfect in the text
of any of his characters. Brough and Charles Hall we
noted in Australia for good memories. Quite an aD-
noriual one was Phil Beck’s. Beck recited Coleridge s
whole lengthy tragedy of “Remorse, just for the
pleasure of Chief Justice Coleridge and his family, uns
was the more striking, because this piece w not in any
theatrical repertoire. It was even more difficult than
learning off a Shakspearian play, a la Brandram °r Hocke
Richardson. Brandram did not begin till he was 50, and
then piled up an extraordinary stock.
“ Sinksee ”: It is the fashion, nowadays, to heave ironic
bricks at the good old transpontine melodrama. '-
pear for the rugged old defendant, me Lud. It !S ur B eo
against him that he makes the judicious grieve ; that he
is crude, unpolished, blatant; that he pulls ug y a
and gets hysterical ; that he has no light and shade, n
nuances, no reserve, no anything worth having , tnat
there are no complexities in his psychology ; that the
loves and hates of which he is composed are stark ele-
mental emotions and, in moments of crisis, take no
count of that artificial restraint which, under the name
of “ polish,” modern convention deems so estimable ,
that he is a veritable hotbed of horrors with his faces at
windows, severed hands, falls from balloons, fights on
the sea-floor, and midnight pranks in ruined nulls ; that
his native indelicacy is shown in the choice of deaths he
offers those of his exponents whom the exigencies of Ins
unfoldment require him to remove ; that his circular-
saws, steam-hammers, flaming furnaces, knives, stui-
ettoes, boomerangs, sandbags, pistols, poisons ana
electrocutions do, as death-dealing instruments,
leave nothing to the imagination, and are therefore
“inartistic” ; that he hides old men’s wills for fun, ana,
in the few moments’ respite he snatches from crime,
absent-mindedly commits forgery and arson. These are
some of the Charges against him, me Lud. I admit their
truth and ask, “ What of it?” He makes the judicious
grieve ? I grant, me Lud, that the grief of the judicious
is a terrible thing to witness —almost as terrible, indeed,
as is the mirth of the judicious over the banalities of a
modern musical comedy, or the absorption of the judi-
cious in the unfoldment of some sordid domestic tragedy
catalogued as a problem play. But I submit, me Lud,
that, after all, the dress-suited judicious are under no
compulsion to dance attendance on his idosyncrasies. The
melo. is the dramatic pabulum of the groundling, and as
such fills as useful and as necessary a niche in the sock
and buskin scheme as wild and woolly Indian yarns do in
a youth’s literary progress. He tears his passion to atoms
in a strenuous, whole-hearted way that makes a direct
appeal to hearts too unsophisticated to appreciate the
virtue of reserve, and quickens into activity, with far-
fetched coincidence, imaginations which any stricter
adherence to the probabilities would leave cold and un-
stirred. I plead for the good old transpontine, me Lud.
The very complacency with which he lays himself open to
amused criticism should be, with the generous, his best
safeguard against it.
The clever girl’s name was Valmay. At an early age
she created a stir in the home circle. At 12 she took to
dressing in a cream imitation silk, with a red belt and
hosiery and a large bow in her curls. In the a.m. hours
her hair couldn’t be seen for rags and papers screwed up
into double-hitch knots. Valmay was too dainty to soil
her hands. She spent the day making gestures in front
of a full-length mirror. Ma, who hadn’t any talents,
killed beetles and time in the kitchen, between scrubbing
and washing, and tried to make both ends meet on
less than a living wage. She got so completely out of
the habit of sitting down that her friends reckoned
she would stand up after she was dead, and be
buried perpendicularly. Valmay, after awhile, con-
tracted the competition habit. She gained most
points at Blampied, Koranderrk and Gheringhap, and
wore loz. of medals on a filled chain round her neck.
Her jewellery, which was too numerous to mention,
could not be told from the real thing. Ma starved the
family to make Valmay look sweet. She was sure she
would be famous. When Valmay developed ankle-skirts
she joined an All-Star Aggregation, at a small salary,
and helped to execute “East Lynne” in the
Mechanics’ Institute at Axedale. The poor country folk
had never done the Aggregation any harm, anyway.
Valmay struck what the great dailies call a financial
crisis or a tightness in the money market In the end
she participated in the ceremony with a man who didn’t
have anything to speak of. After a brief period their
bliss was interrupted when he realised that Valmay was
a frost at domestic toil. Her fal-lal bill kept him broke.
After the decree nisi had been granted Valmay was too
proud to return to her menial family. They were not up
to her standard. Valmay now teaches other clever girls
the histrionic art, and gives instructions in stage deport-
ment at No. 17b Ham-street, Fitzcollingwood.
“Rambling Native”: Am an Australian just re-
patriated, after a 12 years’ exile. lam cursed with a
wandering foot, which has taken me into just about
every theatre in London and New York, not to mention
the State Theatre at Buenos Aires ; also, one that’s sub-
sidised at Antwerp, and others all over the globe. But
none can beat our own in one respect. The rule in Bull’s
country is a number on every seat in the house, and only
the holder of the stub of an admission ticket, dated and
numbered, is allowed to occupy the seat. In other lands
there’s a smoke-room on every floor, where the males can
retire when the agony gets too thick, and rooms also for
the ladies ; in hot weather ice-water free ; and, above all,
civil ushers and no tips. Australian theatre-goers may
get good stuff, but they get no comfort. In particu-
lar, the owner of every theatrical license ought to be
made to furnish numbered and dated tickets. No ex-
cuse for standing room then. If that system were intro-
duced perhaps Private Enterprise would wake up and
sell tickets in advance at no extra charge. About the
only stink that a law like this would make would be to
create the scalper. And he’s not so bad, for when you
deal with him you know what seats you are getting, and
if the numbers and rows are not satisfactory you don’t
take them. Anyway, it would be better than the present
way of standing in line like a lot of Bruins round a soup-
kitchen joint, and then paying an extra shilling for the
pleasure of sitting one hour or more in air that dis-
colors the scenery.
“ Wang” : Ever notice the influence of the drammer on
the hiring-library ? Mostly, the sap-headed public which
gets its literature on the hire system rushes whatever
looks new. But not always. Thus, before Asche and his
company arrived, “ Count Hannibal” (the novel) lurked
in a forsaken stall in my book-lending caboose. From the
moment of the Count’s arrival, I couldn’t give the public
half the Hannibal it asked for. At present, Caine’s
“Manxman” is being rushed, on account of Pete and the
Baby ; and I know that when the Arcadian Co. comes
back, with the amorous Tom Jones in tow, that naughty
old dust-covered book will be wanted badly. A new
book, “The Third Degree,” is having a bit of a run at
present on account of the play, though the novel is poor.
“ Henry of Navarre ” is being asked for too, so that sub-
scribers can know what Julius intends doing. Many
people will not read an old-timer simply because it is not
new ; but when the old-timer is presented as a new
play, then the poor old book stands in great danger) of
being torn limb from page, in the frantic endeavor of
curious persons to get hold of it first.
“ A. Flat.” : I am roused every morning at 6.45 by the
infant next door striking the introductory chords of the
“Maiden's Scare.” At 7 o’clock, the child who lives on
the other side of the vacant allotment starts to help de-
molish the cool silence of the morning with “ Sing Me To
Sleep.” About 7.30, a lad who will come to an undesir-
able end somewhere, but who is at present located across
the street, urges me to leap to the devil by pounding out an
old polka. After 7.30 there is no rest for even the deafest
of us. It is the same in every boulevard I know—and I
am acquainted with many. What becomes of all
these early-morning thumpers in after life? Do they
(hallowed phrase!) “pursue their studies” and de-
velop into decent musicians? Not on your life ! As soon
as they can afford to defy the ambitious parents by whose
orders they leg-iron themselves to the frosty keyboards,
they discontinue the early morning uproar, and thereby
give the thankful neighbors a chance to drink to the
very dregs every gallon of sleep they have earned. In
these days of good mechanical music, it is terrible to hear,
as you wave your razor round your face, the voice of
some dishonest woman ordering a reluctant child to
resume its drudgery on the gleaming teeth of the piano.
The child hates it, and the neighbors hate it, and it
causes the piano exquisite agony. lam thinking of form-
ing a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Suburban
Pianos.

We dvvell in Melbourne, where the tram
Electric takes its whirring flight,
Where motors flit, and hansoms slam,
And glows the incandescent light.
The other week, to seek the Show,
Came Uncle Ben and Auntie Flo
From t’other side of Toombalow.
All day they gazed on bloated pigs,
On mighty bulls and gentle kine,
On rams in corrugated wigs,
And stallions very large and fine.
At six they catne home, nearly dead,
And chatted of the sights, and fed ;
And then at eight they went to bed.
But Uncle Ben resolved that they,
Before returning to the farm,
Must go one night to see the play.
They donned their best, and, arm-in-arm,
Stood out their handsome togs to show.
Said Uncle Ben : “ It’s seven, so
Jist bring the lantern, and we’ll go.”

AFISH TAIE
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
sd
FROM where our dreaming steamer lay,
I swam into the tiny bay
Whose ti-tree bands,
With slim, green hands,
Had beckoned me for half a day.
A glow of faery lit the place,
The golden rocks, the harbor’s grace,
And in a pool
I found a school
Of mermaids, wondrous fair of face.
They were not strange, they were not shy,
But grouped in charming poses nigh,
With winning smile
And maiden guile
, For my regard did sweetly vie.
And while we bathed, a happy band,
Or sunned ourselves upon the strand,
Each mermaid coy
Learned to enjoy
The kiss she could not understand.
Then came police, a zealous press.
My mermaids all in dire distress
Away were packed,
Because they lacked
The regulation bathing dress !

The Cemetery Shipwreck.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THERE are three things in life that hit a man
hard. The first is his 35th birthday ; the
second is his discovery that the woman
he loves is going to marry the other man ; the
third is—but perhaps you had better read the
story. The third is the worst. And all these
three strokes of fate fell on Flarry Truscott’s
head within 24 hours.
Of course, as you will have gleaned, Harry
Truscott was always in love—and always with a
girl who w'as Different. And each time he was
overcome with surprise to find out how many
Different girls there were in this delightful world.
But this feeling of wonder was always follow'ed by
the greater discovery that all girls, under their
powder, are The Same. With most men this dis-
covery does not come till after marriage. And
when each new girl showed beneath her super-
ficial Difference the same old Sameness in spots,
Harry quietly sheered off, and set forth on his
quest again. In many cases, however, it w’as the
girl W'ho made her own discovery first —that all
men are The Same. But this time Harry was
not only in love with Lilian, but wanted to marry
her. She was Altogether and Permanently Dif-
ferent. And she was going to marry the other
man.
So, this evening, Harry sat in his smoking-room
after dinner and tried to grin. To-morrow he
would be 35 —half-way to 70. He looked back
over those 35 years—or, rather, he looked round
his room. There, on the w'alls, stood the records
of his life—some dozens of photographs, each in-
timately inscribed in a feminine hand. There
stood the staring array of the girls he had flirted
with, the girls he had taken out in his motor-
launch, the girls he had kissed. In that multi-
tude of portraits he saw the abiding romance of
Sydney Harbor by moonlight. And to his
memory that romance tasted bitter. For among
that record of his past foolishness he found not
one face that recalled the first thrill. The photo-
graphs had not faded —the romance had.
He unlocked a little drawer in his desk and
reverently took out the photograph of the girl he
had meant to marry, but had never kissed. The
girls on the walls stared dowm at it disdainfully,
wonderingly, humorously, witheringly. He put
it carefully back in its own little draw’er. She
would appear on the wall alone, or not at all.
For she was more than Different; she was The
One.
And to-morrow that photograph was going to
marry his best friend ; and his best friend, Billy,
had had the cheek to ask him to act as best man.
Harry had promptly discouraged the idea. And
to-morrow he would be 35.
The final flick of the whip that lashed his
memories lay in the fact that it w'as Harry him-
self wbo had introduced Billy to Lilian.
Harry had been first attracted to her by the
fact that her parents’ house in Shell Cove pos-
sessed a water frontage and a w'ater-gate. The
conjunction of a garden sloping to the Harbor
and a pretty girl had been irresistible to Harry’s
volatile heart. Why, with his fast launch and a
moonlight night, the presence of a w’ater-gate and
a pretty girl insisted upon romance. The little
gods who ruled these things had set the stage
and chosen the actors.
But when Lilian had consented to go out in his
launch with him, and wben, that first moonlit
evening, he picked her up at the steps of the
garden, he certainly found her Different ; but
Different in an altogether extraordinary way.
She would not flirt, and, though she allowed
him to take her out on several other nights (one
of them quite dark), and though she had seemed
to enjoy the adventure, he had never dared to kiss
her. Usually he kissed first and explained after.
He was getting old—or else serious ; and either
possibility shocked him. Perhaps, he admitted,
Lilian —this serene and smiling Lilian-—was to
blame.
They were delightful evenings in the launch,
nevertheless ; and Harry hardly missed the love-
making in this new, fine friendship that had
grown up between them. She was so straight,
so candid, so genuine.
Then had come, one night, at his own invita-
tion, Billy Asquith to keep them company. Billy
kept Lilian company, and Harry looked after his
engine and the wheel. After that he did not ask
Billy ; and Lilian did not come . . . and after to-
morrow Billy and Lilian would keep each other
company for life.
Alone in that photograph-haunted smoking
room, Plarry could not bear to think it all out.
For a man of his temperament there was only one
place in which he could think. He rose, and
strolled down the garden to his launch. That
burnished, beautiful, lean little speed-launch was
all that he, and his 35 years, had left. But, for
the first time in his life, his launch did not satisfy
him.
To-night, as for many nights recently, he had
no passenger. Fie determined to run round the
harbor at full speed. The rush over the w'aters
might calm the turmoil of his thoughts. But his
thoughts made even the X’s 23 knots an hour
seem slow. And everywhere he went that night
he came across the girls whom once he had
thought Different. In motor-launches that he
overtook, in the secluded stern seats of ferry-
boats, in drifting rowing boats that he nearly ran
over—everywhere he recognised the girls he had
once flirted with, and in every case the girl had a
man’s arm round her w'aist.
Harry slowed dowm. What was the use of
rushing round the Harbor when it was filled with
the women he might have married ? He spun
the wheel, and set a course for Shell Cove. lie
was going to look at Lilian’s house—for the last
time.
Lilian’s house blinked through the trees as
Harry stopped the X at the well-remembered
steps, and pensively gazed, trying to make out
which lit window indicated the presence of Lilian,
Up there she was making merry with a party of
girls, showing to their awed eyes articles of filmy
attire, the beauty of which does not appear to the
world—except, and only partially, on windy days.
Or, perhaps (he liked to think it), she was alone
in her bedroom, sadly tearing up his—and
possibly other men’s—letters. And he was alone
on a harbor filled with graves.
He dropped his gaze for one last look at the
water-steps whence he had so often helped Lilian
down into his launch. On the grey wall he made
out a still patch of white. A girl was sitting
there, alone in the night.
He said it softly to himself, not daring to dispel
the marl dream his desires had conjured up.
And Lilian rose and stood at the top of the
ste

in, he said eagerly. “ The launch ! ”
She looked at him. “Take me !” she sud-
denly said, like a drowning man throwing away
his lifebelt.
He took her—to the launch.
And when—oh, so carefully—he had lifted her
in, he saw by the lantern light that her dear eyes
were wet. There is only one thing to do when a
woman cries. Harry didn’t do it.
“Don’t talk,” she commanded. “Go full
speed ahead—anywhere ! I must have one night
of freedom before . . . before to-morrow !”
Harry made no reply. He was utterly con-
tent. This night was his and hers. To-morrow?
How did he know there would be any to-morrow,
despite the popular prejudice that the sun rises
every morning ? He had this night.
So through the darkness they fled. As the
Heads loomed up between them Harry saw the
crooked late moon rising. The pale glow drew
her eyes and she pointed.
“ The moon ! ” she said. « Take me to the
moon j ’»
Harry obeyed, and over the slow swell of the
Pacific the lean little X swiftly flew. No word
broke the joy of that throbbing rush to the horizon,
as Harry drove steadily on into the wide freedom
of the ocean.
“ I’m afraid I can’t make it,” he said at last,
pointing to the lifted moon.
“ I thought you could do anything—to-hight,”
she sighed. “ Let’s go on and on in the track ol
the moon.”
It lay like a pathway beckoning, but Harry
slowed down.
“ We must go back now,” he said.
“ Why can’t we go on . . . and on . . . ? ”
“Because I’ve only got enough gasolene for
three hours, and”—he looked at his watch—“it’s
after nine now.”
“ Gasolene ! ” she cried in dismay. She had
been living in a dream world. Gasolene brought
her abruptly back to the thought of her wedding-
day. It was needlessly cruel of gasolene.
“Besides,” said Harry, with a glance round,
“ I think there's a southerly coming.”
“ Would there be any danger, if it caught us ? ”
she quietly asked.
“ Not with the X,” was his cheerful reply.
Her answer, when she at last made it, thrilled
Harry with an absurd happiness. It was only an
“ Oh ! ” but to his incredulous ears it sounded like
a disappointed “ Oh !”
A wild surmise swept into Harry’s mind that
perhaps she and Billy—but no ; she loved Billy,
and was going to marry him to-morrow. Wrought
up as she was with excitement, she had felt the
need of distraction from thoughts on this last night
of her freedom, and the launch had offered her
the opportunity. It was mere chance that her
old friend, to whom she could trust herself, hap-
pened to be in charge of the launch. In her life
that night Would remain only as an incident. To
him it would always remain a miracle.
He swung the launch round and steered for the
far-distant, pointing finger of the lighthouse.
Then something broke. The worst of launches
that go 23 knots an hour is that, so often, some-
thing breaks. They are constructed solely for
speed—not for taking girls out on the Pacific
Ocean the night before they are going to marry
the other man.
“What are we stopping for?” Lilian’asked
with interest and a look at him that, as he bent
over the engine, he lost. He did not know how
great had been bis loss.
“Breakdown somewhere. I’ll have to find
out,” was his brief reply.
“0h!... It’ll go again, won’t it? I
mustn’t be home late.”
“ You won’t—if I can help it,” he grimly re-
plied, with his head among the machinery.'
“ Can I help you, Harry?” she asked, anxiously.
“ Hold this,” he replied, giving her the elec-
tric torch, “ and keep your finger on the button.”
It seemed to both a long time as he worked at
the engine. He was so intent on his work that
he did not notice the change in the southern sky.

lie dared not kiss her.
She would not ci'ouch down out of the spray as
he commanded, but stood, swaying and clutching
the side of the boat, staring with him into the
darkness ahead. So, for some time how long
Harry could not tell ; he had no chance to look
at his watch they drove before the southerly, and
never the finger of the lighthouse pierced through
the pall.
“ We must be near the Heads,” he muttered,
“ I’m frightened of passing them.” He swung in
a point or two, and held on, slantwise through the
growing waves. The wind had increased to a
gale. Fie and ghe were wet through ; but a swift
glance at her in the light of the swaying lamp
showed her eyes alight, and lips that seemed ready
for happy laughter.
“ I shall live this night over again—for ever ! ’
she laughed.
“So shall I! ” But Harry did not smile.
Suddenly, wjth.a wrench, he pulled the wheel
over. Ahead.of him, rushing at him, like dark-
ness toppling on him from the sky, he made out

a blacker blackness. And at its base, right
ahead, he saw a faint blur of white.
He reversed the engine—but too late. The
next instant the inevitable crash came.
The little X shuddered—a long, pitiable
shudder ; and Harry caught Lilian and leapt. He
fought for her life in a smother of white water ;
and after an eternity a huge breaker flung the
two high on a shelf of rock,
Before the next roller could come to suck them
back again, he had struggled forward with Lilian,

last Lilian whispered : “ You saved me, Harry!”
“ Your life ? Well, I had to.”
“ Oh, you saved more than my life, Harry.”
Then, when he would have spoken, she

a delightful day for her wedding.

Hurry knew about the rock-climbers—those
reckless, fishermen who delight in this strange
species of Alpine adventure, and whose enthusi-
asm for rock-fishing leads them to leave unex-
pfored no possible w 7 ay down to the best fishing
points . often, as in this case, they find it
necessary to fix ropes and beams in order to
make the descent possible. These tracks down
an apparently unclimbable face of rock are known
only to a few. The knowledge of them is kept
c fo S e in order to preserve the best fishi" o points
fo r their discoverers.
One of these tracks he had‘discovered. Fur-
ther up, he came to a pathway that ran round
an d under the cliffs, l ' and after a stiff, but
not dangerous climb, he stood on the top.
He found himself in a vast cemetery,
Fie had been shipwrecked at the base of the
cliffs that wall off Waverley Cemetery from the
ocean. A walk of 10 nffnutes, and he could get a
tram for the city.
Harry felt the first disappointment of this ad-
venture. He had only to descend the cliff and
help Lilian to the top—and she would be happily
wedded that afternoon.
Fie did not descend the cliff for a while. He
sat down and did so,pie hard thinking. Lilian
had asked him to take her out in the launch. She
had told him to kiss her—and he had kissed her.
On these slender premises Harry’s volatile heart
built up a wondrous possibility. Did she really
love Billy ; and, if she didn’t, could he carry her
off for himself? And, even if Lilian did like him
a little—or a lot—if she were carried off, would
she go ?
He reluctantly descended the cliff. She did
not wake till he was standing looking down at
her.
“ I’ve been exploring,” he began ; “ climbing
the cliffs ”
“Did you find a way up ? ” she asked. She
seemed surprisingly awake for one whom a second
before he had seen in deep slumber.
“ No,” he lied.
She looked at him consideringly, and her face
slowly flushed. Or was it the sun that lit her
features ?
“There’s no way out?” she asked again.
“No possible way out? And I must look a
sight ! ”
She looked down at her draggled skirts, and
suddenly broke into ringing laughter. “ Then
we’ll have to stay here. What aGo ? ”
“ Till we’re rescued —but that won’t be long.
There’ll be search parties out by this afternoon.”
“This afternoon?” She looked at him, a
smile on her lips. “Do you know the time ? ”
He looked at his watch. “ Half-past ten.”
“ Then” she paused a£ she took it in.
“ Then it’s too late for the wedding.
Holy smoke ! Won’t there be a row ! ”
She went off into another peal of laughter.
“ But we might be found any minute—
we can’t be far from Sydney. There’s
plenty of time till the wedding.”
“ Oh, you men ! ” she smiled. “ Even
if we could be in Sydney now, the wed-

dressed for it under four hours ? ”
Harry gasped.
“ Well, for one’s own wedding,” she pityingly
explained, “ do you think any girl could possibly
do it under six ? ”
Harry sighed his relief. It was not necessary to
tell her, but he would tell her at 2 o’clock.
With six hours for dressing, that would make the
wedding too late for that day, anyhow.
“So it’s all off,” she thoughtfully sighed.
“ And it was to have been such a pretty wedding !
And won’t mater row, and just won’t Billy go
on ! ”
“ I bet he is frenziedly searching the cliffs for
you at this moment,” said Harry, grimly.
“Billy wouldn’t get up before 10 —even to
marry me.”
Harry smiled. “Then, even if I could find a
way up those cliffs, it would be too late? ”
“Of course, Harry !” And she shot at him a
look that she knew was perfectly maddening to
any male under 70. And Harry, she knew, was
only 35.
The shot hit the bull’s-eye. Harrv roughly
raised her to her feet, and just as roughly kissed
her.
After the usual interval he said the usual things ;
and she, in his arms, looking sideways down at a
draggled ankle and a pulpy, high-heeled shoe,
seemed to like hearing them. Then, when he
took her face in his roughened hands, and push-
ing aside her wet rat-tails of hair, compelled her
to look in his eyes, she admitted happily that she
did not altogether dislike him.
“ In fact, you silly, I. was in love with you all
the time, only you're so forgetful, you forgot to
ask me. (Interval.) Then, when Billy came
along, he told me you weren’t the marrying sort.
All the other girls had told me that, too, and you
said so yourself. (Dissent.) So I had to be-
lieve you all. Only it took me some horrible
long nights, when I couldn’t sleep, before I gave
in. (Interruption.) You see, lam the marry-
ing sort —and Billy was all right, when you had
put yourself out of the running. Oh, it’s horrible
to have to tell you all this ; but that night we
were out with Billy in the launch, I should have
been delighted if you had heaved him overboard
/ Interruption) and let the old launch wreck
itself wherever it wanted to ! (Interval. ) And,
last night, I saw it all, out there in the garden
( Interruption) ; and I just willed you to come
(Inteiwal) and carry (Interval) me (Interval)
off! (Continued interruption.) You’re smother-
ing, me ; please, Harry, please /”
(Interval.)
“Well,” Lilian said, straightening herself and
feeling that more than ever she looked a fright,
“ as that’s all settled, we may as well go home.”
“Go home?” Harry echoed. “How on
earth ”
“That fisherman will show us the way,” was
her astonishing reply.
Harry followed her gaze, and saw on the next
point a lone fisherman intent on his line.
“ How long has he been there ? ” he asked.
“Just come.”
“ How did he come ? ”
“Oh, there’s an easy track down the cliff a
few hundred yards further on,” was her smiling
reply.
“How on earth do you know that?” Harry
snapped.
“ I asked him.”
“ When?”
“ He was there, fishing, early in the morning,
when I woke up. You were sound asleep—
goodness, you do sleep well! So I told him that
we were shipwrecked, and asked him if he were
shipwrecked, too. I thought we were on a
deserted island, and I was disappointed when he
said we were just beneath Waverley Cemetery.
He told me there was another track up the cliff
behind us —the one you couldn’t find ; but the
tide would be low
enough for us
to walk round
by 3 o'clock.'*
“ It’s going down now,” said Harry. “ Hor-
ribly fast ! ” _
“It won’t be really low enough for us till 3
o’clock,” Lilian demurred. “ And there doesn't
seem any other way out. The fisherman must be
mistaken about the track you couldn’t find.”
“ I found it,” Harry sadly admitted.
“And you didn’t tell me? Oh, Harry, that
was nice of you 1 Billy would never have thought
of that. ”
“Well, shall we try the cliff?” Harry, not
very eagerly, asked. “You’re wet through, and
you must be perishing from hunger.”
“ I never thought of hunger—till now,” Lilian
admitted ; “ but I’m afraid I’m too weak to climb
the cliff. Let’s wait till the tide is low.”
(Interval.)
“But what about your people—and Billy?”
Harry asked, pulling his soppy collar straight.
“ Won’t they be worrying ?”
“ Oh, I asked the fisherman to send them
telegrams. ”
Again Harry gasped, utterly ruining the pulpy
remains of his collar.
“Yes. He looked such a kind young fisher-
man. He seemed delighted to do it. He’s just
got back.” She called to the lone amateur on
his jutting rock.
“ You sent them ? ”
He was busy with a bite, but he flung a “Yes”
over his shoulder ; and then looked round to
shout : “ Can your friend be disturbed now ? ”
But before Harry could shout back an indig-
nant reply, the fish on his line, which promised to
be a record weight, made the fisherman utterly
forget everything else in the world.
“What did you put in those telegrams?”
Harry asked, relieved.
“ Oh, in the one to mother I just told her that
the wedding was off, as I was shipwrecked on
Waverley Cemetery ; and that I had changed my
mind about marrying Billy, as he would wear
yellow boots ; and that the caterers and the clergy-
man and the bridesmaids must be telephoned to ;
and not to worry about me as I was quite com-
fortable, and you were looking after me, and I
was wearing wool underneath. And in the one
to Billy I just said I had changed my mind ; and,
if he really wanted a wedding to-day, he’d better
marry Ruth—my best bridesmaid, you know—
who was madly in love with him, and would take
him as easily as one takes influenza; and . . . oh,
well, that’s all.”
“Must have cost that fisherman a fortune,”
Harry commented.
“ I told him to send them ‘collect.’ ”
“ But didn’t you tell Billy where you were ? ”
“ It wasn’t worth while,” she smiled confi-
dently up at him. “ I said at the end that I was
engaged to you ! ”
/“'But I was sound asleep then. I hadn’t
even ’’
Lilian laughed happily. “Oh, hadn’t you?
You men are so transparent. As if it’s ever
necessary to say a thing when all the time you
can't help looking it ! ”
(Interval.)
“And now we’ll make ourselves comfortable
till the tide goes down.”
Harry looked down at his launch, hopelessly
wrecked; he looked back at his bachelorhood,
also on the rocks; and then he looked at Lilian.
Close following her first two blows, Fate had
struck the third.
There are three things in life that hit a man
hard. The first is his 35th birthday; the second
is his discovery that the woman he loves is going
to marry the other man; the third is his discovery
that the woman he loves is going to marry him.
The third is the worst.

Clement-Bayard Motor Cars.
DOCTORSI
Do you know that the 4-Oylinder 8-14 Clement-Bayard Motor Car, with double
Biiseton side-entrance body, with detachable back seat, will carry you 102 miles
on 3/- worth of motor spirit? That it simply romps up Pymble Hill on the 2nd
gear? That it will stand up against hard wear surprisingly? That, although
one of the most costly small cars in Europe, our price in Sydney is only £275 7 All Powers of
Clement-Bayard Cars are in Stock, fitted ready for the road. No vexatious delays over bodies being built.
Body, 6ft. 41n. x
2ft. 2in.
Three Speeds forward

Equal Tyres 700 m/m
x 85 m/m.
4-Cylinder 8-14 h.p. Double Phaeton Body,

THE NEW 1911 MODEL 12-18 H.P. CARS, with double phaeton side-
entrance body, we are now showing ready for the road. Price
£450
3 Speeds forward and one reverse, Thermo Syphon Cooling, Radiator placed behind the engine.
Bosch magneto Ignition. Four Cylinder Engine. Bore 80 m/m x Stroke 120 m/m.
Equal Tyres 810 m/m x 90 m/m.
“One of the best types of Oar to reach this market, and one suitable for Australian conditions, is the
12-18-h.p. Clement-Bayard,” wrote the Daily Telegraph after seeing the 1911 Models.
WHY?
Well, a driver has nothing: whatever to do except watch the road. No lubrication to
watch and worry over. NO timing:, to be constantly altering:.
NO possibility of back kicks—everything is automatic throughout the car. An owner has only to steer.
Clement-Bayards are great hill-climbers, and are famed for reliability and their great power to stand up
against hard wear.
The New Model is an ideal car for family use and touring ;it turns in a 25ft. roadway. It creates very
little dust, owing to its unusually high clearance.
It has a charm of appearance, which, whilst being very distinctive, is very handsome.
Being one of the three crack cars of France, the land that leads in Cars, the price is extremely low.
Indeed, our prices for Cars generally, high-wheel Buggies and Lorries, will be found to be 25 per cent,
lower than those of other first-class makes.

LAURENCE HOPE’S FAMOUS LOVE
POEMS.
Indian Love
The poetry of Laurence Hope must hold a unique place
in modern letters. No woman has written lines. so full
of a strange primeval savagery—a haunting music—the
living force of poetry.—Spectator,
Stars of the Desert
Individuality is the real touchstone, and this all-
important qualification the author possesses. . . . It is
not merely that these verses describe Oriental scenes and
describe them with vividness; there is a feeling in the
rhythm—a timbre of the words that seem akin to the
sand and palm-trees and the changeless East.— The
Outlook.
The Garden of Kama, and other Love Lyrics
No one has so truly interpreted the Indian mind—no
one, transcribing Indian thought into our literature, has
retained so high and serious a level ; and, quite apart
from the rarity of themes and setting, the verses remain
true poems.— Daily Chronicle.

Welsbach g'as light
WHEREVER gas is available as an illuminant, the installation of
Welsbach Fittings and the constant use of Welsbach Mantles make
a big reduction in the monthly gas bill and greatly improve the
light. Indoors or out, in Shops, Factories, Businesses of any description,
cottages or mansions—town or country —WELSBACH Gas Light is
undoubtedly the best.
“Welsbach” stands for efficient and economical lighting. Every appliance
that bears the well-known Welsbach Trade Mark, carries with it a guarantee
of perfection. No need to waste money in experimenting—Welsbach goods
are always reliable.
Mantles of every kind, burners for upright and inverted Gas lights, Jena
chimneys, fancy Globes and Shades, Gasfittings, Hall lights—all these bearing
the WELSBACH trade mark are obtainable from your Gasfitter or Storekeeper.
Welsbach Spirit and Kerosene Lamps are equally reliable. If you cannot
secure these goods locally, write us direct. Catalogue free for the asking.

air gas.
An ideal light
for country use.
AIR GAS is made by
ingeniously mixing
about per cent,
of Petrol vapor with about
per cent, of ordinary
air. It gives an extremely
brilliant light with the aid of
the Welsbach Mantle, and
the gas is equally well suited
for cooking and heating
purposes.
The percentage of Petrol vapor is so small that when the Air Gas is
brought into contact with the outside air it can neither ignite, explode, or
cause injury to human or plant life. It will not light other than in the burner ;
and, even if a leak did occur, it is not explosive. It is practically non-
odorous, and not injurious if inhaled.
Very little plant is necessary. The machine, which is illustrated, is self-
contained and supplies its own motive power. It is easily fixed, and just as
easily worked. No complicated quicksilver, clockwork, weights, etc., to get
out of order. It requires no water.
A 30-light machine runs at its full capacity for hours upon 1 gallon of
Petrol, each light giving 100 candle-power. Ordinary gas pipes can be used,
and only special burners are necessary besides the apparatus. There is no
condensation in the pipes, and no increase in the insurance rate.
Fullest particulars supplied on application. Here is a comparison of Air
Gas with other illuminants for 1000 c.-p. per hour. Note that Air Gas costs
the least:—

The Perfect Metallic Filament Lamp.
EVERY user of Electric current is vitally interested in Welsbach Electric
Lamps.
Welsbach Lamps are the perfect Metallic Filament Lamps. They
have the strongest Filament, which makes them as immune from breakage as
the ordinary carbon lamp, giving at the same time a much superior light with
a considerably decreased consumption of current. Welsbach Lamps are
made to burn in any position, do not blacken, last longer, and every filament
is standardised for the voltage, which is plainly marked on every lamp.
Welsbach Filament Lamps excel all others for strength , efficiency and
economy. But be sure you obtain WELSBACH Lamps. The trade mark is
stamped on every one for your safeguard. Beware of “ cheap ” so-called
Metallic Filament Lamps.
Any size, any shape, any candle-power, any voltage, indicated in our Lamp
Catalogue, we can supply at once. This Catalogue is free for the asking.
Welsbach Lamps are stocked by leading electricians and storekeepers.

Keep cool with the aid of a
Welsbach electric fan
THE days you do not feel like work in Summer time are the days you
need an Electric Fan. It freshens you up, fills you with energy, and,
to the employer especially, the small cost of installing Fans proves a
splendid investment, because of the better results obtained from his employees.
In Welsbach Electric Fans are embodied all the special features necessary
■to ensure satisfactory working. The high state of perfection these Fans have
been brought to, and the lowness of the cost in comparison with the benefits
obtained, bring our Fans within the reach of the smallest cottage as well as
the largest business or works. An effective Electric Fan, because of its
economical working, is fast becoming indispensable.
Welsbach Electric Fans operate practically without noise, the only sound
when they are working being a slight hum, which is caused by the rapid
displacement of the air.
The electric current consumed is very small, and tne cost of installation
and upkeep is exceedingly low.
These Electric Fans can be had in the Desk, Wall, Self-revolving, Ceiling
and ordinary Ceiling types. It costs little to keep cool with the aid of a
WELSBACH Electric Fan, for Welsbach Fans are small current consumers.
We also have an ingenious Gas Fan. It is strongly made, works well,
inexpensive to run, and will prove a boon to many homes. It requires very
little attention; you have only to turn on the tap, light the gas inside it, and
it works most satisfactorily.

A STILCK PIANOLA PIANO
Is the Ideal Christmas Gift.
®!»
mill
lilt
I ' ' l *’ ' *
THERE is no gift costing a like amount that is so impressive, so in keeping with the
whole spirit of giving, as a Steck Pianola Piano. Its dignity, its beauty, the splendid
possibilities for musical enjoyment it offers to everyone, have made it a favorite with those
who wish to express more than the usual amount of esteem or affection in their giving.
People do not buy fine paintings and then hang them where they cannot be seen. Neither
do people buy books printed in a language they do not understand. Why, then, should they
buy pianos which they cannot play ?
A STECK PIANOLA PIANO means music of the kind that people enjoy most. That
is—music that is actually being played by someone, and not mechanical music in any sense
of the word.
If unable to call, write for Catalogue C
IF there are half a dozen members of your household and you have a STECK PIANOLA
PIANO, you can soon tell from another room just who is playing it. The perfection of
the STECK PIANOLA PIANO’S construction, and its absolute control of effects,
make it as sensitive to the performer as any hand-played instrument, and distinguish it from
all its imitators.
If you are thinking of buying a piano, or making a present of one, surely the piano that is
always a real musical instrument and never simply an ornament, is the one to buy.
ANYONE, no matter how far removed his or her previous life may have been from music,
can play and enjoy the PIANOLA PIANO at once.
It will be sent free for the asking.

A FEW DON’TS.
IF you wish to preserve your hair and keep it healthy—
DON’T wash or apply water to it every day, as these have a most
exhausting effect on the Scalp and Circulation of the Hair.
DON’T forget to use the brush, as brushing the hair promotes the
circulation, and a good circulation is conducive to
a healthy growth of hair.
If your Scalp is dry and covered with Scurf —
DON’T think for a moment that washing it
with Soap is going to cure it—AS IT WON’T.
The cause lies deeper than the surface, and wants
skilful treatment to remove it. And Remove It
You Must, or you will lose your hair, as a con-
gested scalp always means a weak circulation of the
hair.
If your hair is falling out, DON’T use Quack
Nostrums. When a person fails at other callings,
he invariably turns to making up preparations for
the hair, which he knows Absolutely Nothing
About. Treating the hair is a fine field for exploita-
tion for these people who cannot make a living at
other work. They make a general cure-all of a
pinch of Borax, a drop of Glycerine and two drops
of Ammonia —for'which they charge three or four
shillings. —See Government Report.
Treating the Scalp and Hair is my Life’s
Work. I have given 33 years of study to the
Hair and its Treatment, and the information
acquired is at your disposal in treating your hair.
Wonderful Testimonials
can be seen at my consulting rooms, proving that
my treatment is successful if used for a reasonable
time.
Scalps which have been nearly bald for years
are now growing a good, healthy crop of hair.
Mr. Cummings .writes from S.A.': “My hair is getting on first-rate.”
Mr. Johnson writes from Queensland : “ I have used your treatment for
a few months, and my hair is growing real good.”
Mr. Crosby, Sea Lake, Victoria, writes : “Two years ago I had no hair
on the top of my head; now, thanks for your wonderful remedies, I have a
splendid crop of hair.”

SHAM PUNA
No Soap, No Soda, No Borax.
All these Hair=destroying things can be dispensed
with in washing the hair.
Nature supplies the remedy. SHAMPUNA
cleanses the hair beautifully, and leaves it soft and
glossy, and does not extract the natural pigments
from the hair. It does not sap the vitality of the hair,
but helps to make it grow while you are washing it.

You Can Save More Money
with BERKEL’S than any other Slicer.
«5
EVERY provision man and also the public now recognise the many advantages of the Bacon, Bread and
Meat-Slicing Machine, which pives them the choice of 14 different thicknesses, besides being hygienic.
It has come to our notice that cheap slicing machines, purporting to be the Berkel pattern, are
being offered to the public. We would specially warn intending clients to be on their guard and not
be persuaded to purchase one before first seeing the latest up-to-date models of the genuine Berkels Patent
Bacon, Bread and Meat-Slicing: Machines, fitted with the Patent Twin-Stone Automatic Sharpener. This
machine will take the full width side of bacon, without splitting the belly from the back, and at the same
time we guarantee it to cut every bone in the pig, ham bone included. Since the Berkel’s Patent was
introduced many cheaper machines have been tried on the market, but have proved so utterly useless and
wasteful and unprofitable to the user they have been scrapped, and the Berkel’s Patent installed.
Compare the Berkel’s with any other Slicing Machine, and you will find it is the best value in the market
and will give every satisfaction. Write for full particulars.

Forest Devil.
Tbe “Devil” you Know is better
than tbe Devil you don’t Know.
THE “ BUNYIP ” will give you good service, complete satisfaction, and
will speedily save you its cost by saving valuable time and exhausting
labor. The dangerous explosive and laborious pick and mattock
are superseded.
Just glance at the following testimonial, selected by us from hundreds
of others :
“ Braeside,” Yarragon.
I have worked your “ Bunyip ” Forest Devil in pulling out stumps and trees ; I
can say that it is absolutely the best machine that I have ever used for doing the
work. It does all that is claimed for it. It only requires one man and a boy (14
years of age) to work it. One man and a boy will do more work than four men
grubbing and charring in the old way. (Signed) G. MULCAHY.

THIS is a new invention but recently patented, and probably one from which
you will derive more benefit and comfort than could be obtained by the
expenditure of many times the price in any other manner. By this invention
you can sleep outside the year round in all kinds of weather. In the hot,
dry weather you can, as a further protection from the sun, mosquitoes and flies,
throw up the sides to form a double roof, drop the mosquito netting, and be more
comfortable than are most crowned heads. If you are ill, get one of these Beds, and
give the pure, fresh air—Nature’s main remedy—a chance to cure you. 'lf you are
not ill, get one, and keep well and feel better. Remember, one of these Beds is not
only equal but better than a bedroom, and a trial of sleeping in one of them in the
open for one week -will instil so much new life that you could not be coaxed to
again sleep indoors. Can you imagine anything more pleasant or healthful than
reclining under a shade thoroughly protected from flies, mosquitoes, etc., on a
comfortable bed on your lawn Sundays ? Don’t procrastinate in this matter, as
it will add years and enjoyment to your life. Write us for prices.

'M’ATURE’S lines are graceful,
A " smooth flowing, healthy lines
like the Venus Medeci —not
broken, injurious, and harsh as
produced by the ordinary corset.
Nature intended you to have graceful, smooth
and flowing lines —these are the lines our new
Corset, the D & A Diredtoire gives you.
The resultant health you’ll enjoy by wearing
the D & A Diredtoire —the resultant fine shapely
physique are Nature’s smiles of approval.
We looked the fashion centres of the world
over in our quest for a perfect corset.
Our designers studied the styles at the
Longchamps race-track, Paris, in the tea rooms
where fashion’s leaders meet, in the great dress-
making establishments of the Rue de la Paix.
Then our ideas were developed on the human
form, and our D & A Dire&oire is the result.

Well Regulated families
are fully alive to the importance of being prepared for those troublesome
attacks of Indigestion and kindred ailments common to all, and of effectively
dealing with them in the early stages before they have become dangerous
or chronic. Well regulated families are careful to have always a sound
reliable remedy immediately available, and as experience has clearly proved
the undoubted superiority of Beecham’s Pills as a family medicine, a box of
this invaluable corrective is always kept at hand. For removing such
distressing disorders as Dyspepsia, Biliousness, Liver troubles in general,
and Constipation, it is ever the wisest and most satisfactory course to
Jake
Beecham’s Pills. The remedial properties of these pills, however, are not
limited to the cure of digestive troubles alone, but exercise a specific and
beneficial influence upon the nervous system. Well regulated families are
aware that there is no finer tonic, nor any more certain means of banishing
disease from the household than may be secured by a judicious and regular
use of
Bcecbam’s Pills.
Sold everywhere in boxes, price 1/1} (56 pills) & 219 (168 pills).

Dread of Indigestion
drives many men and women to a mistaken dietary regime,
and—chronic dyspepsia. It is the greatest mistake in the world.
Anybody who knows the supreme corrective value of Cockle’s Pills
can enjoy all the rational pleasures of the table with impunity. Cockle’s
Pills thoroughly purify, regulate, and strengthen the digestive system.
They ensure natural functional activity. Physicians have recognised
this for the last century.
