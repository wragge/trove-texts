ARAB LOVE SONG.
The hunched camels of the night *
Trouble the bright
And silver waters of the moon.
The Maiden of the Morn will soon
Through Heaven stray and sing,
Star gathering.
Now while the dark about our loves is strewn,
Light of my dark, blood of my heart, O come !
And night will catch her breath up and be dumb.
Leave thy father, leave thy mother
And thy brother;
Leave the black tents of thy tribe apart 1
Am I not thy father and thy brother,
And thy mother ?
And thou—what needest with thy tribe’s black
tents
Who hast the red pavilion of my heart?
FRANCIS THOMESON.
* The cloud-shapes often observed by travellers in the
East.
AN ARAB SONG.
Saadi, the Poet, stood up, and he put forth
his living words ;
His songs were the hurtling of spears and
his figures tlie flashing of swords.
With hearts dilated our tribe saw the
creature of Saadi’s mind; 1
It was like to the horse of a king, a creature
of fire and of wind.
Umimah, my loved one, was by me: with-
out love did my eyes see my fawn,
And if fire there were in her being, for me
its splendor was gone.
When the sun storms on the tent it makes
waste the fire of the grass:
It was thus with my loved one’s beauty—
the splendor of song made it pass.
The desert, the march, and the onset —
these, and these only, avail!
Hands hard with the handling of spear-
shafts, brows white with the press of
the mail.
And as for the kisses of women, these are
honey, the poet sings,
But the honey of kisses, beloved, it is lime
for the spirit’s wings.
PADRAIO COLUM.
Two of the new anthologies which come
tumbling over one another nearly every week
are so attractively clad that they win further
inspection.
One is A Boole of Verse by Living Women
(Herbert and Daniel). It contains selec-
tions (not always the best) from Alice Mey-
nell, Margaret Woods, “Michael Field” and
some twenty others. Their verses are very
nice and neat and all that, but rather dull.
Edith Nesbit (Mrs. Bland) is not repre-
sented, and she has written more passionate
lyrics than any of them. There is nothing
from the “Songs of the Glens of Antrim," by
Moira O’Neill, presumably still alive. A se-
lection from Louise Mack, Jessie Mackay
and Mary Gilmore would have raised the
level of the book, but the editress did not
look far for her material.
The other is Eyes' of Youth, from the same
publishers, This has some early poems by
the late Francis Thompson, and a batch of
verses by young writers who have been to
some extent influenced by him. There is
freshness about most of the contents, and
promise—especially in the work of Francis
Meynell—and sufficient of poetical quality to
make the book worth buying. Two of the
poems are printed above.
Emily Bronte
The Complete Poems of Emily Bronte.
edited by Clement Shorter (Ilodder and
Stoughton, 75.). This edition, limited to
1000 copies, contains the 39 poems by
which Emily Bronte has so far been known,
and no less than 138 additional poems.
The copyright of the new poems belongs to
C. Shorter and W. Robertson Nicoll, who
do not explain why they have been with-
held from general circulation for so long.
There is, as they say, nothing amongst the
new poems so fine as “The Old Stoic.”
Many were intended for those romances
composed by Emily and her sisters for their
own amusement. Such are the lines “To
the horse Black Eagle, which I rode at the
Battle of Zamorna.” Tlie poetical quality
is often slight; yet they are all interesting to
anyone who has read her other work. There
are many complete lyrics as good as this
one:
It is too late to call thee now.
I will not nurse that dream again,
For every joy that lit my brow
Would bring its after-storm of pain.
Besides, the mist is half withdrawn,
The barren mountain side lies bare,
And sunshine and awaking morn
Paint no more golden visions there.
Yet ever in my grateful breast
Thy darling shade shall cherished be ;
For God alone doth know how blessed
My early years have been in thee !
Some longer ones are better. The creatures of
Emily Bronte’s imagination were so real
to her that they evoked emotions as poig-
nant as if they were tax-paying citizens,
and the reader of these poems gets fre-
quent glimpses of the power which : *§ade
Wuthering Heights an unforgettable crea-
tion.
W. B. Yeats
All the verse that W. B. Yeats has seen
fit to publish since he collected his “Works”
a few years back, is contained in a slim
volume called I'he Green Helmet and other
Poems, beautifully printed at the Cuala
Press of his sister in’Dundrum, Ireland. The
book takes its title from “an heroic farce,”
in which Cuchulain and two others are
visited by a joker from Spiritland, who leaves
a green helmet “that was for the fore-
most man upon the ridge of the earth.” Dis-
sension follows, in which their wives join,
and the business is ended by the return of
the spirit, who claps the helmet on Cuchu-
lain’s head. There are gleams of humor
about the playlet which might carry it off
with an Irish audience; and the verse is
carefully fashioned. Yet it does not seem
worth while for a man of Yeats’ capacity.
The farce is preceded by a series of lyrics
entitled “Raymond Lully and his wife
Pernella.” This is one of them:
If any man drew near,
When I was young,
I thought, “he holds her dear,”
And shook with hate snd fear.
But, oh! ’twas bitter wrong;
If he could pass her by
With an indifferent eye.
Whereon I wrote and wrought,
And now, being grey,
I dream that I have brought
To such a pitch my thought
That coming time can say:
“He shadowed in a glass,
What thing her body was.”
For she had fiery blood,
When I was young,
And trod so sweetly proud.
As ’twere upon a cloud,
A woman Homer sung,
That life and letters seem
But an heroic dream.
There are others, not, perhaps, equal to
Yeats at his best, yet such as no other than
Yeats could write. The trouble with him is
that his energy, which was never great, has
been frittered away in drawing-rooms, and
the playhouse, and in propaganda work.
His weariness finds words in the “Momen-
tary Thoughts” of this book:
The fascination of what’s difficult
Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent
Spontaneous joy and natural content
Out of my heart. There’s something ails
our colt
That must, as if it had not holy blood,
Nor on an Olympus leaped from cloud to
cloud,
Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and
jolt,
As though it dragged road metal. My
curse on plays
That have to be set up in fifty ways,
On the day’s war with every knave and
dolt,
Theatre business, management o£ men.
I swear before the dawn comes round
again,
I’ll find the stable and pull out the bolt.
And this is another confession:
All things can tempt me from this craft
of verse,
One time it was a woman’s face, or worse,
The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;
Now nothing but comes readier to the hand
Than this accustomed toil. When I was
young,
I had not given a penny for a song
Did not the poet sing it with such airs,
• That one believed he had a sword upstairs,
Yet would be now, could I but have my
wish,
Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish.
There never was a time when Yeats gave
the impression that he had a sword up-
stairs ; but the Celtic reader of his Poems
might have thought there was a fairy harp
in the Yeats homestead. If so, it has been
mislaid for a long time.
Vigorous Verse
When Australia wants a clarion-voiced
singer who will thrill the young democracy
to a fiery onset, no doubt she'will get him.
Meanwhile, there are a good many writers
of clear and strong verse who are trying to
shake up the sleek-minded and the indif-
ferent Australians to realise what war at
their own doorstep would mean. One of
these is W. H. Elsum, whose Australia and
Other Poems has just been published by
George Robertson and Co.
Elsum sees Australia as “a prize for
who comes first.”
Her empty places pierce, like a great
wound,
Her heart; while ’round her fringe of
coast
Her people fight and strut and waste
fair time
In tinkling platitudes and paltry sport.
Contentious children, with no shudd’-
ring fear
Of what-the morrow means, so that to-
day
Be fair and bright and prodigal of joyl
Would we had had to fight for what we
have! —
We'would be better patriots; would
rank
Our country higher than to let her
stand
Sport for the butchers; would with a
wild dread
Learn what our women-folk will have
become,
Ere the sun sets upon that shameful day
When Hell crowds ’round.
He joins Kipling in scorning “the flannelled
fools at the wicket,” and asks if “in the
days of rape and ravish . . . shall our
silly sportsmen waken to the awful bugle
call?”
Or shall still they, scream the odds
As the stricken stallion sweats
For their pleasure, —
Till their leisure
Shall give place to war’s grim measure,
when their gambles and their bets
Shall be wagered with the gods?
The chances are that “the sport” will face
the music with the best, and in another
place Elsum seems to think so, too.
The fervor of his patriotism makes Elsum
shout rather loudly. If> however, it pierces
the ear-drums of the half-deaf who are un-
aware of the rumble of distant guns, his
verse fulfils its object. In “the other
poems” he scatters superlatives and exag-
gerated imagery with too much energy.
“The Desert” is to him—
A ghostly grey land, habited by shapes
Unholy, uncouth, with weird, wild cries,
Remembrant of the morning of the world.
And the gaunt eucalypts, “like to shapes
smitten to alabaster ’mid their sins,” are
“moaning their adamantine misery.” The
violence of the patriotic bard has frightened
away poor Poetry.

To pass from the strenuous notes of El-
sum to the dulcet tones of A. G. Steven’s
The Witchery of Earth (also from Geo.
Robertson and Co.) is like quitting the
neighborhood of a vigorous brass-band to
hear the murmur of bees in a trimmed and
secluded garden. They are imported bees
for the most part, and though their music is
not without beauty, it has a drowsy effect.
A. G. Steven knows what poetry ought to
be, and has had a vision of Romance:
Her shadowy hair did garment her around ;
Her eyes were haunts of living dreams,
And, when she spake, the melody of
sound
Flowed sweetlier than enchanted streams.
“I am Romance,” she said. “I do inspire
The weavers of sweet-cadenced rhyme,
If they would sing the songs that they
desire,
Then must I sway their singing time.”
After some improving remarks, Romance
disappeared.
Yet I must still pursue her thro’ the ways
She treads —and haply not in vain.
Perhaps not, if A. G. S. looks for her in the
realities around him.
A Strange Story
In August, 1901, two English ladies in
Paris went for a walk to Versailles. One
suggested a visit to the Petit Trianon, which
she had " read about years before as a little
farm where Marie Antoinette played at the
simple life. They thought they had lost their
way, when they came to a ghostly sort of
garden, where the trees were fiat and lifeless
“like a wood worked in tapestry.” They
passed silent people in strange costumes, and
had speech with some others, and eventually
got out of the garden and home. They did
not question the reality of the persons or
places until, on comparing their experiences
afterwards, it was found that one had seen
certain figures which had not been noticed
by the- other at her side. They found, too,
that the costumes were those of Louis XVl.’s
time, one of the figures closely resembled an
authentic'" portrait of Marie Antoinette, the
other figures agreed with personages around
the Queen in ‘ 1789, and the date of their
visit was the anniversary of the sacking of
the Tuileries in 1792. One of the ladies re-
visited the place in the following January,
and had a similar experience. Two years
later, they both went there again, and found
everything normal, and hardly anythihg in
agreement with their first vision. For some
years they have spent their leisure time in
verifying the details of the historical picture
which was conjured up so extraordinarily
for their benefit, and they now publish their
respective narratives, proofs and answers to
objections, as An Adventure (Angus and
Robertson).
The real names of the ladies are not given;
but the publishers, the reputable firm of
McMillan, guarantee that the story has been
faithfully and accurately set down. This
sort of thing has been done in fiction; but
here the reader gets the impression of fact.
It seems to be one of those true ghost
stories which have lent a credence to so
many fakes and illusions.
» —
The book which has made a sensation in
Paris, Marie Claire, by Marguerite Audoux,
has been done into English by J. N. Raphael,
and the translation reaches here (per
Dymock’s) before the original. An intro-
duction by Arnold Bennett explains that it
is part of the autobiography" of the semp-
stress-author. “It is not fiction. It is the
exquisite expression of a temperament. It
is a divine accident.”
However divine the original may be, there
is little charm about the translation. Evi-
dently its success - has been due to its style,
and that has evaporated in Raphael’s hands.
One can see that thisT simple story ot^ ;i
foundling at an orphanage and on a main
might be a prose poem in the French.
Trivial events acquire some importance in
their relation to Marie Claire, who preserves
the pure soul of a child through a career of
hardships. Yet the substance of her story
in English is not worth the space, and for
vital interest is not equal to George Meek
Batli-chairman, a recent English auto-
biography.
There are two or three pieces for recita-
tion in A. Scott Craven’s Alarums and Ex-
cursions (Sydney Book Club), and some
other verses which are worth reading.
Craven imitates “Ingoldsby,” Anstey and
Gilbert with much cleverness, especially in
the making of cataracts of words like those
which came doAn at Lodore. This is part
of the description of Lady Fudge’s knock:
A sharp, emphatic, autocratic, fierce, morda-
cious, pervicacious, variegated, concentrated, com-
plicated, cultivated, most expressive, most aggres-
sive, overbearing, self-reliant, dominating, aggra-
vating,. devil-daring, world-defiant, irritating,
vicious, grating, cross, capricious, altercating,
world-suspicious, world-dictating, calm, judi-
cious, elevating, bold, ambitious, penetrating,
cold, officious, calculating, nice, precise, dis-
criminating, critical, pervestigating, sudden,
swift, reverberating, “only dare to keep me
waiting,” “ INSTANTLY this door unlock ! ”
Subtle, sinister, Satanic, trenchant, truculent,
tyrannic, influential, consequential, Mede and
Persian, harsh, Draconian, viraginian, Ama-
zonian, grim, severe, loud, unethereal, prim, aus-
tere, proud, managerial, vain and mundane, most
material, most unfurtive, most unmystic, self-
assertive, egotistic, unmysterious, though ab-
normal; though informal, wholly serious; frigid,
rigid. MOST imperious: “Open-^-Sesame—this—in-
stant —or —I’ll—show —yer ! ” —sort of knock.

P. R. Smart (Sydney) objects to Walter
Murdoch’s pessimistic view of twentieth
century fiction (“Bed Page” 12/1 /’ll) :
“In his opinion no very good book has ap-
peared in English during the last ten
years, and never does after one is 25. So
far from ceasing to thrill as' one grows
older, the taste for good writing improves
witli age, and at no time are the pleasures
of the intellect keener than in a hale man
of 50. That is my age. Murdoch is all
astray about no great works of fiction being
produced nowadays. From my own read-
ing I can name 50, but will limit myself
to a dozen. Heye they are:—
Bacheller The Master
Conrad and Hueffer ... Romance
Galsworthy ... Man of Property
Harland Cardinal’s Snuff Box
Haldane McFall ... ... Mastcrfolk
Kipling Kim
Locke Morals of Marcus
Lucas ... Over Bemerton’s
Onions Little Devil Doubt
Snaith Broke of Covendon
Wilson ... ... ... ... The Spenders
Wharton ... House of Mirth
All these are great books. They all possess
humoxv pathos and atmosphere, lacking
which last no work of fiction is convincing.
Tono Bungay, which Mr. Murdoch praises,
is a great book, but it is not fiction —it is
problem all through, with the problem left
unsolved. The great English novelists,
Fielding, Scott, Dickens, Thackeray and
Reade are fitly mated by-Meredith, Steven-
son, Kipling, Conrad and Locke. The old
giants may excel in matter, but the mod-
erns certainly do so in manner, plot and
drama.”
[The last two sentences are about right.
The word “great,” however, could only be
applied to some of the books named as an
equivalent of “ripping” or “boshfer.” The
value of Over Berner ton’s, for instance, de-
pends upon the parti-colored garment of
quotations which covers the skeleton of
story, and to rank it with Kim or Marcus
or Broke is absurd. That Tono-Bungay
closes with an unsolved problem is true: so
does life.]
There has probably been enough written about
Robert Louis Stevenson to last for a generation;
yet there is some interest in H. J. Moors’ With
Stevenson in Samoa, because of the freshness with
which a practical man writes abfcut a romantic
personality. This book was published in America
some months ago, and has now been re-issued in
England by Fisher Unwin. . . . Lay Morals and
other Papers, a, collection of Stevenson’s essays
which have not been obtainable except in the
limited editions of the collected works, is an-
nounced by Chatto and Windus. It will include
the Open Letter to Father Damien,
Received from Chicago, the January num-
ber of Life and Labor, published by the
National Women’s Trade Union League,
which reprints one of Bernard O’Dowd’s
sonnets, and states on the title page
that the Editor is Alice Henry—for-
merly of Melbourne, and the Assistant
Editor is S. M. Franklin —known in
Australia as Miles Franklin, of My
Brilliant Career. \
The January number of The Twentieth
Century Maga. (Boston) prints a por-
trait and character-sketch of Edward
Tregear, of Maoriland. The warm ap-
preciation of Tregear’s work was writ-
ten by Stanley Kingsbury, of Bris-
bane.

A Leading Australian Public
School Teacher Recommends
CLEMENTS TONIC
Mr. A. H. Dakin, was formerly in the Government Education
Department, N.S.W., as chief schoolmaster on board the training ship
“ Sobraon.” Thousands of Australian lads owe their scholastic attain-
ments and successes in life to the careiul educational and moral training
received at his hands. Mr. Dakin writes of Clements Tonic thus :
“ 29 Lyttleton Street, North Sydney,
“ CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“As a brain and brain medicine I recommend
Clements Tonic as being superior in my opinion to any
other medicine that can be bought for money. 1 have
often suffered from nervous headache coupled with that
condition of being run-down and used up, so common
among those whose occupations are of a clerical
character. Never have 1 found Clements Tonic to
fail to produce a perfect condition of nerve health.
“(Signed) A. H. DAKIN.”
Men in all ranks of life and professions praise Clements Tonic. Solicitors,
clergymen, journalists, editors, and business men and women recommend it. It
keeps the blood pure, the heart sound, the nerves strong and the stomach healthy.
Send for it if you have Loss of Sleep, Sick Headache or Indigestion. All Chemists
and Stores sell it throughout Australia. Send for it and health at the same time.

Thin Women!
Would you like to
be Well and Fully
Developed ?
df
sd
ANY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the one
essential that creates a perfect appearance. Lack of proper
bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly
take from a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. . .
Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural development
is concerned, but science has found a way to correct your deficiency.
Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and although you
have been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from no wasting
disease, your bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased
to normal.
There are, to-day, hundreds of women who were once thin, fiat-bosomed,
hollow-cheeked, and generally scraggly in appearance, and suffering the effects
of anamiia and defective digestion, who are now, for the first time in their lives,
healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and enjoying the full vigor of robust
womanhood, as the result of a few weeks under our wonderful
“ Flesh-Food *• Treatment.
Many women whose figures have been spoiled by maternal duties have been
entirely restored to splendid form, and flat-chested young women who suffered
slow development have had the fault corrected by this treatment.
Flesh-food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond
question, and its use is no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases have
gained even up to six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measurement up
to eight and ten inches.
TRIAL SAMPLE FREE!
We publish an interesting book on the subject of attenuation and develop-
ment, and will send same and a FREE SAMPLE TREATMENT to you free of
charge, upon receipt of a 2d. stamp to pay part postage. All communications

Balmoral.
Balmoral, rimmed with silver sands,
Wave-washed by lucent tides.
Between green hills and purple
In summer day-dream hides,
The beach is fringed with tawny grass,
Ti-tree, blue-gum and laurel,
And all the girls are bonnie girls
That summer at Balmoral.
Balmoral sings a tranquil song
Beneath cerulean skies,
While opalescent shallows
Lisp lazy lullabies ;
I)ream-eved and lithe and gipsy-brown,
With lips as red as coral,
They are the tiring-maids of love,
That surf along Balmoral.
Balmoral coaxes baby waves
Strayed from the mother sea,
All day their warm lips prattle
Strange speech mysteriously;
Sweet-savored, green and violet,
About the margin floral
They laugh and kiss the cool, pink feet
Of mermaids of Balmoral.
Balmoral dreams all summer time
Soothed by soft lullabies,
And love-light ever dances
In tender, dreamy eyes. . . .
Sweet-hearted, limber, gipsy-brown,
With lips as red as coral,
Oh, youth and love and summer dreams
And silver-sand Balmoral!

The Grey Lady.
Sad in that desert where my deep wounds smart,
Yestreen I met a lady, old and grey.
She gazed at me, but not a word would say,
As with tired feet and slow she paced apart.
I marked her mien, and saw a cold tear start
From those deep eyes that chid and turned
away. . .
Could this be She, my leman blithe and gay,
Who once crooned noon and night against my
heart!
I cried to her, but drooping she passed by
(I saw her tears that fell upon her breast);
Nor sympathy had she, nor care, nor ruth.
.Again I cried, with heartbreak in the cry ;
But swift she faded in the desolate west
And vanished so, my sad, dishonored Youth.

A Lost Soul.
Some of my soul was lost in beer,
And some U'as tangled in the hair
Of Madeline and Edith fair
Who once to me were dear.
I drank of flagons and of love,
A dozen maidens’ lips were mine,
And eyes as bright as stars that shine
Around me here above.
For I am set above them all,
The heavens and hells beneath my feet,
Eternal sunshine or fierce heat
Allure me not nor pall.
About my head the planets roll,
I count the ages moving by,
Above all touch of pain am I,
A mind without a soul.
For such reward the gods have given,
Whose soul is spent on earth below,
He need not wander where they grow
The slow, dull flowers of Heaven.
He need not tread the golden way,
Nor learn an endless chorus part
Who gave the fulness of his heart
To live in earth s short day.
The miser hoard of feelings pent
Is current coin in Heaven or Hell ;
For me, I know that it is well
My soul was freely spent.
For some of it was lost in beer,
And some was tangled in the hair
Of Isabel and Mary fair,
Who once were dear to me.
MAORILAND.

Sonnet from Helene.
You will remember me on summer eves
When the large amber moon above the hill
Peers, and the air is grey and very still.
And bats wheel low above the darkening sheaves ;
You will remember when the young spring weaves
His flowering tapestries by field and rill ;
And when, with harsh voice and rude fingers
chill,
Pale autumn ravishes the shrinking leaves.
But chief on winter nights, when beats the rain
Upon the case, when like a soul in pain
Wails the tom wind, when the last charred 102
falls;
When on your lap the book unheeded lies,
And the gaunt shadows brooding on the walls
Seem like the ghosts of long-dead memories.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin," is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS.
when the address is specified and stamps are en-

unless these conditions are observed. When MS. is
forwarded without stamps for return it will be un-
derstood that the copy is to be destroyed if not ac-

further, those sending MS. to distinctly understand
that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.

SOME OLD-TIME “LIBERAL” ARGU-
MENTS AND A NEW ONE.
A chabactekistic of every Tory campaign
«of late years bas been one or more spirited
efforts to cloud the real issue behind some
bogus contention calculated to humbug or
terrify the uninstructed, and bulldoze
them into voting the reactionary ticket. The
object of the Dreadnought agitation was to
perpetuate the disci'editable arrangement
whereby Australia, in consideration of an
annual subsidy which about paid the local
squadron’s rum bill, had its entire defence ex-
penses found by an ali’eady otherwise over-
taxed people 12,000 miles away. If the Tory
partv in Australia has faith in anything on
earth it is in the gospel of cheapness—
]cheap imports, cheap niggers, cheap labor-
ers, and, above everything, cheap detence.
The system which the Reid-Gook party
nought* to buttress up, by borrowing suffici-
ent' jnonev to buy Britain one bare, gunless,
crewless, unofficered battleship, had the merit
of cheapness in a pre-eminent degree. Never
in the world’s history has a self-respecting
nation been defended so cheaply as Aus-
tralia was under the old regime. Conserva-
tism masked its anxiety to preserve Austra-
lia/s dirt-cheap and, nationally speaking,
utterly disgraceful defence arrangements by
a snuffling affectation of anxiety lor the
welfare of the Motherland. The. home of
the Flag was represented as being in danger.
Patriots of the B. Smith breed clambered
. on to the plinths of statues and the summits
of stumps, and directed haughty words of
defiance at the foreigner—which words, be-
ing boiled down and scrutinised, were found
to mean that, so long as Jerusalem had a
five-pound note to lend, Australia would
be ready and willing to borrow the same and
saddle the redemption of it on posterity —in
the cause of Empire. If the embryo Com-
monwealth navy is nothing else it is a
standing proof that the bulk of modern Aus-
tralians appreciate the degradation of spon-
ging indefinitely on Britain, and estimate
the loafing “Loyalists” of these parts at
their correct value.
The Anti-Sosh campaign rested broad-
based on the audacious lie that Labor in
Australia stood for Socialism and Socialism
was Anarchy. The people were not told by
Deorge Reid, Melbourne Argus, or Sydney
Telegraph that the main object of the 1906
campaign was to protect the land monopolist
from taxation, and enable the absentee
landlord to spend his money in London, un-
checked. On Anti-Labor platforms the land
monopolist’s name was never, never heard ;
and if some coarse interjector did mention
it, he was accorded such a blank stare of in-
comprehension as one might expect who
dragged the question of mouth-organs into
a cultured disquisition on Bacii. The talk
was all of shattered homes and burst marri-
age ties, of the utter capsize of religion, and
of Revolution, and Hell on Earth. But it
didn’t go down. The cloud of excited verbi-
age was too thin to screen from the general
view the large, obvious persons in in-
terest it. was raised. The Australian Gov-
ernment’s land legislation is here to-day to
prove it.
The mendacity that is being chiefly
relied on in the present Referenda
campaign is that the Federal Government,
by "bunching” the amendments, has “gross-
ly insulted the collective intelligence of Aus-
tralia.” The country is asked to be very
angry with Labor on this score. “Liberal”
papers and “Liberal” speakers blandly re-
quest all—Socialist and Anti-Socialist alike
—to forget mere party considerations, and
rise up and fire the Fisher Government out
of office for its alleged intolerable “inso-
lence” —incidentally replacing it by A.
Deakin (who is against land taxation and
most other progressive measures these days)
and the absurd J. Cook (who is a recent
and lukewarm convert from the mean faith
of hired defence and loafing on Mother).
There is no suggestion that the amendments
asked for are not —with one exception—as
reasonable as they are necessary. And for
obvious reasons. The New Protection is
Deakin’s own measure; he also favors the
Common Rule principle and has claimed a
score of times to be as hostile to injurious
trusts as any man. It may be argued that
Deakin is under suspicion of being threat-
ened with democratic leanings; that he is
only “Liberalism’s” leader because the party
is so circumstanced that it can’t achieve a
better; and that often what is represented
to be “Liberalism’s” voice is only Deakin’s
voice. However, in so far as his approval of
the desirability of the vast majority of the
Australian Government’s proposals is con-
cerned, Deakin doesn’t stand alone. Here
is what ex-Minister Garland, of N.S.W.
(one who was never in his life accused of
Socialistic ways), said the other day:—
They [the proposed amendments] consisted, firstly,
of “power to give effect to the New Protection
policy.” He was a Freetrader, but if they must have
heavy Protective duties, stuffing the pockets of
manufacturers with money taken from the people
to the detriment of the latter, then he believed in
the manufacturer’s employee getting a fair share of
that money—a fair and reasonable wage. If, in
these circumstances, the New Protection were a sep-
arate issue at the Referanda, he ventured to think it
would be carried by an overwhelming majority. The
second requirement of the Federal Government, as
stated by Mr. Hughes, was power over “industrial
legislation to cover those matters only partially
covered or altogether neglected by State legislation.”
In so far as giving the Federal Arbitration Court
power to make a Common Rule, here again he was
solid behind Mr. Hughes ; it was only an act of
justice.
The speaker went on to mention that the
Referenda question which revolted him, and
which had caused him to decide on a de-
cisive “No” in regard to the whole lot, was
that one which touched on Trade and Com-
merce. And there he voiced the gag which
is being employed, daily and nightly, by the
entire “Liberal” pack —the contention that
in “bunching” the unacceptable Trade and
Commerce clause question with the accept-
able amendments, the Australian Govern-
ment has been guilty of “thimble-rigging,”
“confidence trickery,” and conduct, gener-
ally, which deserves to be punished with all
the rigors of the ballot-box.
* * * *
As this paper has observed before, there
has been no confidence-business in the fram-
ing of the Referenda questions —no more
than there was disloyalty in the Australian
Navy scheme, or Anarchy in the Labor plat-
form of three years back. The cry of “Con-
fidence trick” has been deliberately raised to
exasperate the thoughtless into the Anti-
Labor camp. The New Protection, a mea-
sure which even the Wades and the Mur-
rays approve, has three aspects. The first,
namely, the securing of fair profits to the
manufacturer, is provided for —albeit inef-
fectively in many cases —by the tariff. The
second aims at securing fair wages for the
employee. With that object the Excise Act
(1906) was passed. It imposed an excise
duty on manufactured goods, which duty was
remitted on the employer showing that he
had paid his employees fair wages. And,
thirdly, there was the Australian Industries
Preservation Act, which was framed to se-
cure fair prices for the consumer. So far
as the Excise Act was concerned, the High
Court laid it down iu Rex v. Barger that
“even if the Act were a proper exercise of
the Commonwealth’s power of taxation, yet it
it was bad, because it infringed upon the im-
plied prohibition against interference with
the internal trade and commerce of the
State.” By that decision so much of the
New Protection as provided for fair wages
to employees went out of the business, and
a constitutional amendment is required to
bring it back. In regard to the ensuring of
fair prices to the consumer —which is to
SaY, the scotching of oppressive trusts and
combines —the Federal Parliament consid-
ered that it had power, under the Constitu-
tion, to make laws respecting “trading or
financial corporations formed within the
limits of the Commonwealth.” The High
Court decided in Appleton’s case that “if the
words ‘trading and financial corporations
framed within the limits of the Common-
wealth,’ stood alone without any qualifying
or controlling context, they might be capable
of bearing the construction contended for by
the Commonwealth Parliament.' Gut, the
Court went on —“If Parliament can declare
an act of a trading or financial corporation,
which is lawful under State law, to be un-
lawful under Federal law* . . . this ts a flag-
g*ant invasion of the power of the States to
make laws in respect of their oxen internal
commerce.” Thus, feature No. 3of the New
Protection, the one that was designed to pro-
tect the public against spoliation, was
knocked out, and required an amendment of
the Trade and Commerce clause in the Con-
stitution to revive it.
* * * *
The present position, therefore, is that,
though the people of Australia declare 50 or
500 times for the New Protection, or for
Commonwealth control of trusts, yet, so long
as the Constitution remains unamended in
regard to its Trade and Commerce clause,
nothing whatever can be effected. And the
same thing applies to the Common Rule.
The allegation that the Australian Govern-
ment, in “bunching” the Trade and Com-
merce amendment with the rest, has worked
a subtle and unscrupulous trick on the
trusting electors, is thus seen to be false.
The yarn is a blood-relation of Reid’s old-
time cry, that the defeat of Auti-Sosh would
produce Anarchy, and a full brother of 11.
Smith’s more recent howl that there would
b: Revolution and Blood if the Referenda
questions are not answered with two “Noes.”
From all of which it appears that if the
electors of Australia are called on to punish
any party for trying to humbug them, it is
not the Fisher Government which should
suffer, but its opponents, who have been
lying so hard for years past that they
seem to have lost the canacity to do the
other thing.
THE MURDER OF INFANT CITIZENS
OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
If the recommendations in Admiral Henderson's
report should be carried out, there will be required
to be enlisted within the next seven years between
4000 and 5000 boys and men. — -General news item.
Where are we going to get them? — General howl.
Well, to start with, something might be
done to save the lives of hundreds of infant
citizens who are being murdered year by
year in the different States. The figures for
N. S. Wales alone will indicate what be-
comes of babies who are not wanted, and at
the same time show in white light the ur-
gent necessity for the final suppression—or
as near it as possible—of Australia’s old
enemy, the J>aby-farmer, whose business, if
not so prosperous as formerly, is still much
too constant for the welfare of this country.
Consider the figures :

Only one thing can be assumed from that,
and it is confirmed by a perusal of the report
of the State Children Relief Board for 1910.
* * * *
The subject is introduced by way of an
appeal for departmental control and super-
vision over “adoption” advertisements ap-
pearing in the daily press, and without hesi-
tation the Board tells the hard truth that
“these advertisements are inserted by cer-
tain individuals who wish to get rid of their
young babies at any price, or by other per-
sons more or less suitable (usually the lat-
ter) who offer to take them for payment.”
The president of the Board, Dr. Macrellar,
M.L.C., states, what is undoubtedly the case,
that it is this unrestrained advertising that
makes baby-farming practicable. Pending a
proposed amendment, of the Act, the Sydney
papers were some time ago approached by
the State Cmldren Relief Board with a re-
quest that it should be shown all “adoption”
advertisements before publication, and its
opinion taken as to the wisdom of their ac-
ceptance ; but, so far, only one paper has
fallen in with the proposal. Publicity is
the life of the evil practice, whereby an in-
fant citizen is handed over with a lump sum
as the price of his or her more or less sud-
den and certain death. The right of the
department to ask for the help of the law
to test the bona fides of persons handing
their children to strangers, or of those will-
ing to accept them, is beyond argument. The
drain on the vital strength of the Common-
wealth, faced, as it possibly will be before
many years have passed, with a life-and-
death struggle, calls for a hefty blow to
check it, and the only manufacturer of .that
kind of blow is the Legislature. Private
enterprise, in the shape of stout newspaper
proprietors, is too definitely stone-deaf to
hear the cries of the doomed infant; and the
lauiuue that has been given Private Enter-
prise in this respect will be one of the justi-
fications for the contumely that will be piled
on the grave of the present age by a more
enlightened posterity,
* * * *
What excuse or explanation can be of-
fered for leaving any gap in the law through
which the arm of the hired child-slayer may
be thrust, to carry off an Australian citizen,
and starve or ill-treat him along the shortest
cut to the place of burial? Yet there are
such gaps, and they have been well known
for years—gaps that past “Liberal” Govern-
ments in N. S. Wales must take the discredit
of not nailing up. For instance, under the
Children’s Protection Act of 1902, the pay-
ment of a lump sum to a cus-
todian by the parent of a child is
legal if any J.P.’s order is obtained —
which is the direct route, in the majority
of cases, to the undertaker. As a matter of
fact, it is admitted by the State Children
Relief Board that the Act, which was framed
to safeguard infant life, can do nothing as it
stands to prevent baby-farming. To close
the gaps, the Department long ago made
several suggestions, one being an amendment
whereby no lump sum might be paid or ac-
cepted by anyone for a child under seven
years of age, except by permission and under
supervision of the chief officer of the depart-
ment. The chief officer, it was recommended,
should have power to require the monev
to be paid to himself, he under-
taking to dole it out in instalments
not exceeding £1 per week. In that
case every child would, of course b<
regularly visited by an inspector. So’far
however, these and other amendments which
are essential to give the unwelcome little
Australians the best possible chance to live
have not been made, and in long procession
the helpless little Australians still move on
to the cemetery—helpless little Australians
who, if preserved, might have blazed in Aus-
tralian heroism, statesmanship, science or
literature. It is perfectly true that the’pro-
cession is not so crowded now as it was
some years ago—in 188 G the 'total deaths
under one year, per thousand births, was
127.7, as compared with 74.3 in 1909 but
it is capable of being reduced by at least 50
per cent, if the States go about the job as
though their existence depended on its thor-
oughness. And when one conies to think of
it —as naturally one does when 4000 or 5000
young citizens are casually demanded almost
at once to start a navy—Australia’s exist-
ence actually may depend on its thorough-
ness. , ■
A LITTLE WHITE AUSTRALIAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a wonderful and hilarious day for
Willy— the day that Sydney was captuied
by the Japs. As Willy was just two years
old, he naturally took a deep interest in
things that happened—and the things that:
happened that day were really-truly excit-
ing. Willy did not care excessively about
things that happened quietly; he liked things
that made a noise —things that clicked (like
the front gate), or banged (like his drum),
or hummed (like the lawn-mower—which
you mustn’t touch), or groaned (like his
teddy when you held him upside down), or
smashed (like the tea-cups when they gave
you the tablespoon to play with at break-
fast). But none of those noises, delectable
as he found them, were to be compared with
the soul-satisfying “bangs” he heard that
day.
They never seemed to stop. At first he
said “Bang!” every time a big gun sent its
havoc-making message into Sydney, seeking
the damaged torpedo-destroyers sheltering at
Cockatoo docks and being repaired with
hopeless haste.
He was perhaps the one individual in Syd-
ney that day who wasn’t frightened, ilis
mum had taught him to laugh at the big
“bang” the thunder sometimes made; and
these “bangs” were only another sort of
thunder —or perhaps someone was blowing
up a big, big paper bag and then bursting it,
a performance at which his daddie was an
expert. At first he used proudly to say,
“Nudder!” when another “bang” went off;
but soon there were so many of them that
he gave up saying “Nudder!” and started to
count them. He counted up to “two,” then
jumped to “five,” and back to “tree.” That
was as far as he had learnt to count.
His mum told him daddie was away fight-
ing, and he doubled up his dimpled fist in
the way his daddie had taught him —thumb
inside—and wanted to fight, too. (If he had
been only 12 years older he would have had
to.)
When he went out to play on the front
lawn (his mum was busy washing up) he
heard things in the air—things that made a
nice new sort of noise above his head. He
lay down on the grass and tried to see them.
But the “dirdies” —he was sure they were
birdies by the chirping, shrill noise they
made —were invisible. This worried him a
lot, till his mum came running, white-faced,
and caught him up, laughing in a way that
almost made you think she was crying, and
hugging him most uncomfy, and carried him
inside, and locked the doors, and kissed him,
and called him her baby, and said the nasty
“bang-bangs” wouldn’t hurt him. All of
which surprised Willy very much.
For the rest of the long day he was kept
inside, though outside the sun was shining,
and he was sure if he looked quick enough
he could see those squawking “dirdies” in
the air. But towards evening he was com-
forted by a big, big “bang” that shook the
house. His mum clutched him tight in her
arms, and screamed out. Willy felt the in-
dignity of that tight squeeze—he always
hated being hugged. He felt it necessary to
his dignity to howl. And —wonder of this,
wonderful day ! —his mum didn’t even slap
him !
Then it suddenly occurred to Willy that
he wanted his daddie.
“Daddie can’t come, dearie,” his mum said.,
trying to laugh. “He’s —he’s sure to corner
home soon. Go to bye-bye, and in the morn-
ing he’ll play lots and lots with his boy.”_
But she snatched him up from his cot, just:
because there was a nice big “bang” close to
him, and held him close to her, rocking him.
And, because he was tired of “bangs,” he
went to bye-bye. ‘
He woke next morning still in his mother's
arms. She hadn’t even put on her nice
nightie. (Women wore nighties-; men like
himself wore “piedams.”) And she was so
sound asleep. He patted her cheek and tried
to poke her eye open; and then, with a sigh,
crawled off the bed and toddled in to tell his
daddie to “Det up !” And daddie wasn’t
there. *-
This was most inconsiderate. Willy re-
turned to his mum and ptilled her plait of
hair till she woke. And she stared blankly
at him, then clutched and kissed him hard,
and cried. j
The next thing he noticed was that the
“bangs” had stopped. He waited quite a
long time —15 seconds —listening for one;
and it never came. He was annoyed, and
said so. ..
But his mother, for some reason, actually
smiled. She lifted him to the window, and.
let him look out. The first thing he noticed
was that there was such a lot of pretty flags,
stuck everywhere. (He called them hoo-
ways,” that being the way he always greeted
flags.) But they were not like any flags
that he had seen.
His daddie had given him a flag for him-
self, and had told him that it was the Aus-
twalian hooway.” His daddie had taught
him a funny little thing to say. dhe gam
was played this way:—
“Who are you?”
“I’se Willy Smith.”
“And what are you?”
“I’se a little w’ite Austwaban!
If Willy said that correctly, he always
got a ride on daddie’s back. So when-
ever he waved his “hooway,” he saic, I se
a little w’ite Austwalian.”
But these flags, he decided, were prettier
then the Australian flag. They were all
red and -white —a red sun in the middle with


red sticks sticking out from R aU around.
Consequently Willy said Hooway .
But his mum said, “You mustn t say
way’ to those flags. They’re naughty flags,
nasty flags. They’re keeping daddie Horn
coming home to Willy.”
Willy, though he really tjf u g h t
•%-rS, ZLX-r w—^
herself; “and I’m glad. He can come back
U °So they waited; and, after breakfast,
which Willy enjoyed, but his mum did
touch, his daddie really came.
He was such a funny daddie, with his face
all black, and his arm in a big towel all
red. Willy’s mum rushed at daddie, ana
laughed and cried all at once then saw tne
towel thing round his arm, and starea.
And his daddie laughed, and said it was
only a surface wound caused by a fragment
of a shell —whatever that might mean. “is
mum made his daddie sit down, and brought
a big basin and hot water which you
musn’t touch because it burns and washed
daddie’s arm. And while she was doing that
daddie went off to bye-bye on the floor, and
mum poured a jug full of cold water on to
daddie’s face, evidently to wash it. And
daddie sat up and smiled.
But what most interested Willy was
daddie’s clothes. They had such tunny hole,
in them —into which you could Poke 70111
linger. Then he discovered that the basin ot
water was such a pretty red color like the
pretty—no, naughty —flags.
“Yes, it’s all over,” said daddie, as mum
made him drink a big cup ot tea. No
chance. We capitulated at 10 o clock last
night. Couldn’t get away till this morn-
ing. Tried to telephone you ; but the wires
were not working. And no ferries running
—all commandeered by the military. It s
hell having Sydney as a naval base. Well,
it’s all over, and the Japs are our masters.
And just then a grown-up came rushing
into the room. .
“They’re Shooting us down! he cried.
“Jap infantry!”
“But it’s all over!” said daddie.
“They insulted a woman up the street,
and her husband shot the brute an officer.
The Japs went mad at that. They re shoot-
ing at everybody in sight. Clear, quick.
“I can’t,” said Willy’s daddie. I m
done.”
The grown-up ran out. .
Willy heard a new sort of noise —like his
rattle, only beautifully louder. He clapped
his hands with delight.
His daddie got up, shaking all over in
Such a funny way, and grabbed up a tunny
long shiney stick that he had thrown down
as he came in, and went to the front door.
His mum went after him, crying out.
Then Willy heard that delightful sharp
rattle again, quite close. He felt lonely, and
annoyed that his daddie had not taken him
to the door to see the rattle. He determined
to explore. All sorts of exciting things, he
felt sure, were going on outside —else why
should his daddie and his mum stay so long
looking at them? .
On his way down the hall he saw his
Australian flag lying on the floor. He picked
it up and toddled to the open door. He
found his daddie and his mum, both gone to
bye-bye on the doorstep. He tried to wake
them up, but they didn’t move. And they
were all red and sticky and wet, and the
floor was pretty and red, too. He called
to His daddie and his mum; but they were
so sleepy they didn’t move. The temptation
came to him to play in that red puddle; but
he heard a noise outside, and toddled on.
He wanted to see the big rattle.
He climbed down the steps, and, holding
his Australian flag, toddled to the front
gate.
A lot of grown-ups in blue clothes, like
little policemen, were in the street, carrying
funny sticks like his daddie’s. He genially
waved his flag at them.
One of them came up to the open front
gate. Willy waved his flag in welcome, and
cheerfully remarked, “I’se a little w’ite Aus-
twalian.” , _ . , c
Willy didn’t know the state of mind ot
his new friend. He made no allowances for
certain facts. He did not know _ that the
Japanese sergeant had just seen his beloved
captain cowardly shot down by a non-com-
batant, simply because his captain had
pushed a foolish Australian woman out ot
liis way. She had rushed up to his captain
crying out that her son was killed. And the
captain had pushed her away. And then a
man, not in uniform, had shot him.
And suddenly other Australians had ap-
peared in all the windows, armed, and an-
other rifle went off. Well, there was nothing
to do but to kill them. The fools did not
know that they had been conquered, or, it
they did, they wouldn’t accept their defeat.
And a cry had risen and flown down the
street before them —the hated, exultant cry
of “White Australia!”
Unless they took immediate steps to quell
this riot they would lose more of their men.
Two had already been wounded. From a
military point of view the sergeant knew he
was in the right. The trouble was that those
foolish Australians did not know anything
about military law.
And now this child, -waving that hated
Australian flag, and crying, “White Aus-
tralia !”
All this Willy did not know.
The sergeant saw red, quivered with cold
rage, and lifted his revolver. .
Willy was delighted at the new shining
toy that his new friend was showing h. 1.
He put out his chubby hands to take it.
Berhaps it was the rattle that made th.se
delightful noises
The squad of infantry passed on.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Dog in the Manger.
C. G. Wade, V.C., the States Frighter who
is the. leading “calamity howler” for the
“No” side in N.S.W., said recently (S. M
Herald, 20/3/T1) that “they were asked to
strip the States Governments of all the
powers they now enjoyed, and hand them
over to one central Government.” This is
the same Wade who, when Premier of
N.S.W., told a deputation of architects and
< it hers that the reason why Sydney couldn’t
lm brought up to date in regard to its streets,
wharf, bridge, railway, and commercial ser-
vices, to the great discomfort and loss ot
the people, was because of the huge quantity
of neglected work which clogged the State
Departments. The position is, in a nut-
shell :
(1) On the one side, the Federal Government,
which at present is not overweighted, is asking tor
a number of powers, some of which it will not use,
but which lawyers on both sides of the controversy
declare must be asked for on the “more abundant
caution” principle. ~ . ,
(2) On the other side the States, and particularly
the State of New South Wales, “enjoy” a great
number of powers which they do not exercise, or
which their Departments are too clogged and glutted
with deferred work to exercise effectively; and they
have also constitutional authority to legislate them-
selves into the possession of a number of other
powers, particularly State in character, which State
Parliaments have hitherto been too careless or too
overworked to attend to.
If Wade were sincere when he told the depu-
tation that he and his colleagues had more
than they could do, and if McGowen has in
self-defence to appoint three journeymen
Ministers to aid the overworked btate Min-
isters in tneir departments, then it is ob-
vious that the States Frights policy is a dog-
in-the-manger policy. It means that,
though the State Departments are im_
potent themselves through overpres« ot
work, no one shall relieve them,
no matter how the public may suiter. And
it is obvious to anyone who has business
with the State Departments that there ts
clogging, and consequent delay. Nor is that
surprising when we consider the list ot
powers which remain to be exercised by the
States. Here are a few of them, so tar
chiefly as N.S.W. is concerned :
(1) Land and settlement, including the reduction
of the chaotic land laws to intelligibility.
(2) Forests, mines and agriculture, including the
nationalisation and conservation of native resources,
alienated and unalienated.
(3) Water conservation and irrigation, with a
prospect of largely increasing the corporate wealth
of the community. . , , . ~
(4) Education —primary, technical, and university.
(5) Local Government —shires, municipalities and
Western division. ......
(6) Public health, badly neglected now, including
the nationalisation of hospitals and curative agencies
and the stamping out of preventable disease.
(7) Town planning and beautification—in which
we are 30 years behind Europe.
(8) The housing of the working classes, a scanda-
lously neglected subject. . . .
(9) Administration of civil, criminal, commercial
and Common Law and Equity.
(10) Police, prisons and asylums. _
(11) Law reform—a crying necessity m all the
States. ,
(12) Ports and harbors, including the mru-oye-
ment of the obsolete, congested and inadequately-
served port of Sydney.
(13) Decentralisation, to open other ports and
commercial centres now sacrificed to metropolitan
interests.
(14) Liquor laws and licensing.
(15) State Constitution and Government —includ-
ing the abolition of the Tory Second Chamber.
(16) State works and undertakings.
(17) The better organisation of the State Public
Service, including the appointment of Public Trustees
and the granting of facilities for the people to secure
homes of their own.
(18) The great State railway services.
(19) Monopolies of a local sort, such as harbor
ferries, etc.
When Mr. Wade, Y.C., goes on liis next
visitation, to Auburn, or anywhere else in
N.S.W., let him be asked how he can abso-
lutely shut out of his recollection the exist-
ence of the above, and a hundred other fefate
functions, many of them completely neglected
or untouched by him or his Ministry func-
tions which will keep the State Governments
fully occupied for as far ahead as any living
man can see. A “Yes” vote, then, so far
from making the State Governments lnettec-
tive, will undoubtedly operate to make them
more effective. The Departments are ad ;
mittedly clogged now; those who vote Yes
will vote to free the wheels a little, so tbat
those who have business with the State De-
partments may have less cause to complain
in the future of the delays which have caused
them loss and irritation in the past.
Where the Trade Union is Necessary.
The failure of the conference of employees
and employers in the Agricultural Imple-
ment industry could be foreseen from the
immovable position taken up by the em-
ploycrs as regards unionism. At the confer-
ence the men offered to return to work with
non-unionists, provided “shop stewards”
were recognised as the official medium of
complaint and request, and provided the em-
ploycrs would meet union representatives to
discuss grievances. These proposals the em-
ployers rejected with steam-hammer empha-
sis. Other requests, for reinstatement of
men and increase of wages, they agreed to;
but as for any recognition of unionism—No!
Yet within five minutes after the conference
had closed, the absolute necessity of unionism
was made clear. This happened when their
spokesman asked Justice Higgins what was
the proper procedure, in the event of his de-
ciding that there was an inter-State dispute,
for issuing processes against the unions un-
der the section prohibiting lockouts and
strikes. This, of course, shows clearly the
necessity of the employees being in a unioA
When it comes to enforcing an agreement or
a judicial decision, or recovering a penalty,
only a legally constituted and organised body
can be effectively dealt with. The idea of
setting the Courts in motion to deal indi-
vidually with claims or charges against
some 2500 employees is grotesque. But the
organised, permanent body can be held re-
sponsible. The employers know this; it is
only when they come to deal with grievances
and complaints as to their treatment of em-
ployees, that they want to ignore the union
and deal with employees individually. In
that case the union’s strength is their weak-
ness; in the other the reverse is the case.
When the “shop steward,” acting as a union
official, lays complaints before the “boss,” he
is a nuisance who must be “sacked” at the
first opportunity ; but when it comes to re-
covering penalties for breach of the law, the
same official, as part guardian of his union’s
funds, is exceedingly handy, not to say
necessary. Unfortunately the employer
wants to hold him in the one case, and dis-
pense with him in the other, and it can’t
be done.
A Protest Against the Dissemination of
Knowledge.
A quaint instance of the cross-eyed way
“Liberalism” looks at things is afforded by
the uproar which has followed Justice Hig-
gins’s lecture on “Constitutions.” Mr.
lliGgins delivered this identical lecture in
Sydney a year or two ago. The local dailies
reported him fully on that occasion, and
spilled, not bricks, but encomiums, on Ins
head. They were justified, because then, as
now, the discourse was no more than an
impartial review, by an expert, of the differ-
ent Constitutions of the world, and, there-
fore, of value to the seeker after know-
ledge. Of all the Anti-Labor papers- which
so savagely attacked the Judge the other
day, only one —the Melbourne Age—at-
tempted to give anything approaching an
extended report of his lecture. Ami not
even the Age, which enjoys a wide-spread
fame for turning its reports to suit the
political book it happens to be laying, was
able to produce the smallest scrap ot evi-
dence of bias on the speaker’s part. In re-
viewing the world’s Constitutions, Justice
Higgins mentioned that a feature of the
Creek Constitution was its inflexibility; he
cited Turkey as possessing a written Con-
stitution which is not interpreted by a
court of law'; remarked that in France, Ger-
many and Switzerland the Legislatures were
practically supreme, while the S’African and
British Parliaments were absolutely supreme
—and so forth. In fact, he presented in
the simplest language a number of truths
which might be gleaned by any reader from
any work on Constitutional History. No
word did he say in disparagement of the
Australian Constitution; not a syllable that
mightn’t have been uttered in the non-
political atmosphere of a class-room. He
simply marshalled the facts as a Judge
migni do who was charging a jury. Yet, a
couple of days later, Sydney Telegraph
came out with the following:—•
Parliament can take no cognisance of this matter
before September next, till which date it stands ad-
journed. Under those circumstances Mr. Justice
Higgins would cut the Gordian knot of what the
Acting-Prime Minister must feel a difficult situation,
by sending in his resignation.
It recalls an episode of the by no means dis-
tant past, when “Liberalism” was violently
l'.ostile to the Arbitration principle. The
late C. J. Barley, being unable to contain
himseif any longer, in face of the strange
new legislation that had come to pass,
broke out with a fierce denunciation of the
then Government’s Arbitration Act. He
didn’t do this before the members of a pri-
vate club ; he did it on the Supreme Court
Bench. He didn’t judicially weigh the
new measure; he condemned it out of
hand, by ana large, and in all its aspects.
And the Telegraph cheered his sentiments.
In the strangely-constructed eyes of Anti-
Labm the offence of Higgins is far more
flagitious than that of Barley. The metic-
ulous accuracy of the High Court Judge’s
information is not questioned anywhere. It
is just there the trouble lies. The Austra-
lian “Liberal” can conceive nothing on
earth more dreadful than for someone to
get up in the middle of an electioneering
campaign and spread the cold light of know-
ledge. Everywhere anti-Laborites are to
be heard railing at Higgins, and always the
burden of their complaint is—“He opened
a history-book for the people. V\ hat is the
matter with boiling him?”
“Stan” : At the recent Sugar Growers’
Conference in Maryborough (Q.), much guff
was talked about White Australia. Presi-
dent Crawford said: “We are entirely in
accord with the conditions binding us to the
employment of white labor, and we believe
that the loyal fulfilment of these conditions
is for the general good of the community.”
Yet only last April Crawford opposed
Bamford for the Herbert, and advocated
drawing a color-line across Queensland, al-
leging the inferiority of the white as a
worker in the tropics. Many a sugar grower,
who was bitterly opposed to the deportation
of T. Tanna, has since become a staunch up-
holder of the present regime, but there still
exists in the north a crowd who will only
employ whites because the so-called “sugar
bonus” compels them to do so. Cane, to
qualify for the bonus —or rebate of Excise
duty, as it really is—must be registered by
area, and thereafter tended entirely by
white labor at least 12 months before the
mill receives it for crushing. In hundreds
of instances, however, the land is, up to the
very day of registration, cleared, burnt off,
holed or ploughed, planted and tended with
the hoe by aliens. Only when the statutory
period begins does the white get a show'. If
the Federal Ministers and members, who are
billed to trip to Papua after the Referen-
dum, can spare a day or two to run through
the sugar districts of the Mossman, Mul-
grave, Innisfail, Herbert and Burdekiu, they
will find first-hand evidence which may
prompt a speedy amendment of the present
Act, making the bonus dependable on the
employment of white labor throughout the
whole procedure of sugar growing.
Some years ago the Ma State Government
gave the Registrar of Friendly Societies
power to rake the brethren fore and aft, and
compel them to conduct the financial part of
their “fraternal” business on business prin-
ciples. Some shocking leaks and muddles
were discovered ; and much the same thing
happened also in Queensland, when the
lodges were overhauled there. In Victoria,
however, in spite of these discoveries, mat-
ters were allowed to drift on in the old way
till now the High Cockolorum of the Inde-
pendent Order of Oddfellow's makes this re-
port :
Last j'ear ... I instructed the grand secretary
to call in and make a special audit of the books of
Lodge No. —. After some delay they arrived. The
grand secretary reported that the accounts were
somewhat muddled, but the money was all right . . .
I had an interview with the finance committee of
the lodge. I took possession of the books they
were auditing, and instructed the grand secretary to>
call in the whole of the books. . . . After consid-
erable delay these arrived, and . . . the fact was
revealed that defalcations had occurred for many
years past. The shortage in the accounts has since
been paid, and the brother has resigned from the
order.
Another official of the same order re-
ported :
The year 1910 was marred by the discovery of
several defaulters. None of them were guaran-
teed, but that will not occur again. Benefit funds
suffered by the defalcations. .. . Deficiencies of
lodge bookkeeping and auditing have been re-
vealed this year to an extent which is painful to
contemplate. I have seen for myself in my in-
spection of lodge books that the benefit funds have
been consistently depleted in years past. ... In
the matter of investments irregularities abounded.
There were documents, also unregistered, purporting
to be mortgages, prepared by unskilled hands.
There were mortgages to individuals instead of to
the trustees of a lodge. There were mortgages to
trustees of non-existent lodges. There were mort-
gages on paper falling to pieces through old age,
and others which were really purchase deeds. There ■
were fixed deposits in the names of ex-members, of ’
secretaries, and of treasurers; shares in a limited '•
liability company, one promissory note, and other ■
matters reminiscent of an auction sale of sun- •
dries too numerous to catalogue.
These societies are the only savings bank and!
insurance office of thousands of hard-work-
ing men. Mostly the members know little :
or nothing of business, and their ignorance:
—which is nothing whatever to their dis-
credit—is traded on by scoundrels. Andl
in scores of cases, where there isn’t scoun-
drelism, the members, through their ignor-
ance of finance, cannot check the muddling;
of men who, though as ignorant of finance:
as themselves, have slid to the front of the 1
procession on their smooth tongues. The 1
members can’t protect themselves, and, as itt
is quite plain that they need protection, the.:
State can’t be in too much of a hurry to*
give them what they need.
—-♦
Among the bills promised for next session!
by the Weary Ministry is one for the ap-
pointment of a “Director of Public Prosecu-
tions.” In justifying the appointment men-
tion is made of the threatened escape of the
recent Ronalo-Harper perjurers. But the
public remembers that, in the subsequent;
prosecution of Robert Harper and the
three other citizens for conspiracy, wherein
Attorney-General Brown acted as Public
Prosecutor, there was a loud call for an
equally important official —a Public De-
fender. If the new official is to be a mere
adviser and instructor of the present Crown
Prosecutors, the job might as well be left
to J. Drysdale Brown or any other
Brown. But if he is going to see that the
accused person gets as good a chance of
proving his innocence as the Crown has of
proving his guilt, then he will be a very
valuable officer indeed.
The remarks of “N.Z.” (B. 2S/3/T1) arc
this paper’s cue to say that it doesn’t mat-
ter which of the Labor factions in M.L. is
the stronger—the new Federation of Labor
or the old Federation. The point is that
they are both shockingly weak. David
McLaren, M.P., one of the very few whole-
hog Labor leaders in Dominion politics, and;
one of the shining binnacles of M.L.’s “big
trade union body affiliated with the Trades
and Labor Council,” recently issued an ap-
peal for a Dominion Congress of Labor;.
Therein his opinion of the position is thus;
set out: —
The many thousands of the rank and file are yearn-
ing anxiously for a lead to be given; and, at the 1
same time, if any individual tries to lead out lie iis
met with jealousy and envy right from the start
The workers are quarrelling amongst themselves about;
formulas, technical rules, abstractions, and questions;
of priority, whilst our country is- gate©; to the ex-
ploiters, and the fat men are becoming- ever mor.ee
aggressive. I believe this degraded position thartt
Labor,, .occupies, like a beggar on the doorstep of the'
house he has a right to live in, is due solely to this,
that we have never demanded of the workers in the
mass the recognition of the truth that they are the
body of the nation and brain as well, and their
proper function in a democracy is to govern in
politics, as they have to create in the industries;
also, their part in politics should be entered on as a
real, downright business, and not as the pastime of
petty debate.
It would be good to be able to agree witfi
“N.Z.” that “a great deal has been done by
the trade unions to bring themselves nearer
the possession of an independent Lhbor
party”; but, in face of the fact that one
section of the party is merely making loud,
unprofitable noises about things far off and
dim, while the other section is listless and
apathetic, The Bulletin can’t do it en-
thusiastically.
+
Victoria’s Chamber of Manufactures con-
sidered the Agricultural Implement Workers'
strike the other evening, and decided that:
they would “stick together through thick andi
thin.” There would be “no flinching, no*
showing of the yellow streak.” Yet when*
Peter Bowling and other sky-rocketw
Labor men talk about “class consciousness,"”
and the universal strike, the Argus and the;
S. M. Herald, and Fat in general, talk
about “callousness,” and “brutality,” andl
the sufferings of unoffending women and!
children. The Bulletin concedes to one-
crowd just the same right to “stick together””
as it allows the other crowd. But, seeing;
that that means civil war, sooner or later*
The Bulletin proposes to make the Com-
monwealth powerful enough to prevent the
commotion, by taking those two crowds, if
necessary, by the scruff of the neck, and
dropping them both back into their working
places. When each of two industrial
crowds —employers and employees—-talk
about “sticking together through thick and
thin,” it is just about time for the people
of Australia to also “stick together through
thick and thin.” If they don’t they will be
badly mangled sooner or later between the
two millstones.

By a music of the sea,
Where —on moonlit beaches gleaming
Under restless tides instreaming—
Gypsy twain we wander free.

Some farmers are remarkably resourceful when
something- jibs in the machinery and ingenuity is needed
to unravel the tangle. If .you’ve a natural turn for
mechanics you are all right, but suppose you’re not about
when the trouble arises? Machinery has to be trusted to
others, so the golden rule is to avoid devices that are full
of complications. For instance, the “ Stover Single-Rod
Principle,” which is found on all Invincible-Stover farm
engines, cuts out most of the troubles that can happen to
an oil engine ; yet that is only one of the good points of

From a man in the innards of South
America: —
The ill-fated “New Australia” movement, which
was heralded 20 years ago with a flourish of trum-
pets as the deatli-knell of capitalism, has gone the
way of other communistic colonies; but the colonies
themselves remain. The sturdy descendants of Aus-
tralians and other Anglo-Saxons live their ow T n hie
in the midst of South America, and speak their own
language—islands of Anglo-Saxondom in the rust
continent. As one rides through these remote wilds,
one may now and then hear a genuine ringing Aus-
tralian “eoo-ee.” Perhaps the lad who shouts it has
never been outside of Paraguay, but is the son of
one of the expedition led to this country by Wil-
liam Lane, the dreamer of splendid dreams.
The original settlement of New Australia is practi-
cally assured now of a prosperous future, all the
more prosperous because the new trans-Paraguay
line will pass right through it. This is no visionary
railway scheme. The concessionaries are busily en-
gaged in survey and other preparatory work. Ihe
company has plenty of money and is spending it
freely ■ it is even attempting to buy up the Paraguay
Central, the only railway line at present in Para-
guay. Probably within two years New Australia will
have direct railway communication with Asuncion
(the capital) on the one hand, and with the Bra-
zilian port of Sao Francisco on the other. This
latter port is at present a small town, but it has a
fine harbor, already touched at by the large German
trans-Atlantic liners, and it only awaits the opening
up of the back country to develop as rapidly as the
neighboring port of Santos. The new railway will
pass through fine territory, taking in on its way the
falls of the Yguazu, the South American Niagara.
When it is completed, it will be possible to seijd a
letter from New Australia to England in about 18
days, instead of at least 35 days, the time occupied
at present. There will also be a mail delivery every
day instead of three a month. The mail transit to
Australia will also be considerably shortened, not so
much owing to the line already mentioned as to the
new railway now building direct from Asuncion to
Buenos Aires, which is already completed to the
Paraguay frontier, and will be opened for traffic
about the end of March, 1911.
Many new settlers have arrived in New Australia
of late, mostly Anglo-Saxons; for it is the great de-
sire of the present colonists to preserve as far as
possible the English-speaking nature of the settle-
ment, an effort in which they have been fairly suc-
cessful. The present “administrator,” or manager,
is Mr. Kennedy, a Scotchman. Many of the settlers,
who a few years ago were poor and struggling, are
now, if not wealthy, at least in comfortable eircum-
The Cosme Colony (the off-shoot of New Austra-
lia, which continued for some time after to live on
communistic principles) has now also definitely
thrown its dreams overboard. For several years be-
fore it abandoned the original principles, it was an
open secret (scarcely even concealed by the inter-
ested parties) that the few remaining members were
held together only by the expectation of the final
break-up, when the property would be divided ; and
the fewer that remained the greater individual
share would accrue to each. The Cosme Colony also
lies close to the railway which is now being con-
tinued to Buenos Aires; and the completion of the
line will be a great benefit to it in many ways.
But, though the colonies are thriving in a modest
way, it has only been as the result of many years of
sweat and sorrow, and the forfeiture of a good deal
of cash, put into them by the early enthusiasts. Few
of those who stayed would have done so but for “the
shame of going back.” While in many ways Para-
guay is a good country, Australians had much better
remain where they are, for theirs is a still better
country. Besides, the language, mode of life,
society, and nearly all that makes life sweetest to
the Anglo-Saxon, are very different from what
either the Australian or the Englishman has been
acustomed to. So the Anglo-Saxon immigrant in
South America very rarely feels at home, and mostly
leaves the country, after an irreparable waste of
time and money.

During a recent Congregational Union dis-
cussion at Hobart, on the evergreen question,
“Why don’t working-men,” etc., the Rev.
Handel Jones said :
He thought it was a mistake to saddle the pulpit
with all the responsibility for the non-attendance of
the workers at the churches. Incidentally, he de.
sired to say that he had come to the conclusion
that the aims of the working men, as interpreted by
their unions, were the most selfish unit in the com-
munity. (Hear, hear.) They were always prepared
to take the maximum of pay with a minimum of re-
ponsibility and risk.
This pronouncement, with the “hear, hears”
attached, constitutes a sufficient reply to the
weary old conundrum. What would a self-
respecting trade unionist find to attract him
to a place presided over by an insulting per-
son like Jones, or by any of his applauding
pals? The President, Rev. J. Sidney
Raker, was not among the applauders. He
frankly admitted that the education of the
masses was working a mighty revolution, and
added: —
And now they were witnessing the second genera-
tion of an educated democracy—skilled, intelligent,
and bent upon working out its own social salvation.
The question was, “How far are the churches wel-
coming the change ?” It was urged that the churches
did not trouble about the workers’ interests, but
represented the moneyed and professional classes,
and, rightly or wrongly, the impression was borne in
upon the manual toilers that the church had no de-
sire to witness much improvement in social and in.
dustrial conditions, and that many in its communion
looked with distrust upon endeavors made for the
social betterment and elevation of the workers.
That is so. The workers don’t go to church
because, for one thing, they never know
the minute the parson may bark savagely at
them, or the capitalist who takes round the
collection-plate bite them on the ear.

“Despondent Dan” states the position:—
We Victorians are faced with the cheerful prospect
of having no local Press to put forward the views
of the decent Australian people who are on the
YES side of the Referenda questions. We have two
newspapers, Argus and Age. The former has been
for many years the mouthpiece of money, monopoly
and misgovernment. It has, however, for many years
been so consistent in its stupidity that people
with the slightest perception can always forecast
its screed. So it deceives no observant democrat.
The Age is very different. That journal for years
was the scourge of the landgrabber, the monopolist
and the sweater. In the late 70’s it did heroic
work in smashing the shoddy importer—the “flesh
and blood merchant” —and was quoted, by demo-
crats throughout Australia, with exultation. But
all this went by the board when it dropped its
pilot, old, dour, crafty David. It is now simply the
Argus, without that journal’s stupidity. Note the
ferocity with which Labor matters are treated ; note
the gangs of old wasters and political pimps it is
taking under its wing in this Referendum campaign
—the screaming hens of the National Woman’s Ass.,
the old reactionary gang. This is what we Vic-
torians are enduring. We have no Australian Press !
The patriot has no organ to provide the weapons
that will slay the enemy of his country, no means
of educating growing Victorians, and warning them,
and inspiring them. And yet we shall win. For
the sentiment of Australian nationhoood is greater
than any Press could be. Give us that, and though
the Age go grinding out its Fatman profits, Aus-
tralia will march on.
Always merry and bright, eh ! Yes, if in
the hot weather you drink “ Montserrat ” Lime
Juice. It cools and purifies the blood.*

“Our Miss Gibbs,” who is still housed at
Sydney Royal, has become one of this city’s
old and valued friends, and the critic has
long ago broken up his pen for fuel and
thrown the empty champagne magnum of
praise overboard. The Wild Cat, who does
all the counting for this office, reckons that
this (Thursday) evening is the 188th per-
formance; also the Religious Editor, who in-
spected the show during the week, reports
that it is still as bright as ever, and that
the pink harem trousers look a lot better
on pretty girls than they appear in published
photographs. The little tripping runs of
the wearers seem to suggest that the sex
is rather embarrassed thau otherwise with
the freedom the new garments allow. Wo-
man is so used to trailing a kangaroo-like
tail after her, and competing in endless sack
races, that she has forgotten for the time
being how to stride.

The Hamilton-Plimmer-Denniston Co. will
fold up its season at the Palace (Sydney)
to-morrow night with a final performance
of “Lover’s Lane,” which has been running
all the week with a cast of 20, and (as the
programme says) Miss Lizette Parkes. The
reason of the distinction isn’t very clear.
Miss Parkes is a promising young woman ;
but, probably, she would do better in musi-
cal comedy, or, anyhow, do better more
quickly. It might be urged that she has not
a good enough voice, but this would merely
show ignorance—of musical comedy. It is
Valentine Sidney who deserves the “and”
in the advt., on account of her Miss
Mattie, the guardian of Parson Plimmer’s
household. Three small lads, Frank Crook,
Walter Mealing and Claude Seabrook, de-
serve honorable mention for the skill with
which they cannot avoid being natural as
schoolboys. That’s a quality in which
Lizette Parkes doesn’t shine. Still no
doubt it is difficult to be as natural as
nature —especially for a woman.
“ THE GRAY KIMONA.” AT THE SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Book by Artist Souter; music by Wynne-Jones.
“Via Wireless” is in its last week at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. Thereafter it will move
on Melbourne with its thrill, its Quenched
Singing-Spark system, and other wonders.
It would be here indefinitely, but for the
fact that the Beanstalk pantomime is com-
ing to Sydney, and pantos, are like fire-
engines, perfect ladies, and so forth, inas-
much as everything must make way for
them.

“The Woman in the Case,” a Clyde Fitch
play of perfectly blithering sensationalism,
opens at Sydney Criterion on Saturday next.
The two nights interregnum (Thursday and
Friday, to wit) between the departure of
the Opera Co.’s Girls, and the arrival of
the Dramatic Co.’s Woman, will be taken
up with “The Grey. Kimona,” the musical
comedy of Souter and Wynne-Jones.
George Marlow is a busy manager these
days; for his new Adelphi Threatre, which
sits on the front doorstep of the Sydney
Railway Station, is getting its finishing licks
of paint. The place opens with “The Bad
Girl of the Family,” on Wednesday, April
5 ; but before that date there will be various
receptions and views, including something
in a large way to-morrow (Friday) after-
noon.

That several people -were not killed out-
right, and the hospitals loaded with casual-
ties, as an outcome of the Skuthorp buck-
jumpers’ first performance in Sydney last
week, may be chalked to the credit of an
amazing breakdown of the ordinary run of
things-in-general. Opinions differ as to
the size of the crowd at the Agricultural
Ground on Saturday afternoon, but it cer-
tainly wasn’t under 60,000 people, of whom
a good few thousands —mostly lunatics —
were inside the arena itself. These latter
acted as though they had escaped from 50
asylums, and had taken a solemn oath to
commit suicide rather than return. They
broke into the big new stand in course of
erection, climbed its topmost girders, until
it appeared that a swarm of large flies had
settled on the place, and pursued those who
attempted to stay them —pursued them with
stones, scantlings, curses, howls, and
the gibbering wrath of the demented.
Hundreds of others —men, boys, wo-
men (some with infants in their
arms) and cripples—-scooted round and
across the grounds, either in front of the
horns, or behind the heels, of a string of
tormented bulls. In one wild burst of
hilarity half a dozen maniacs threw them-
selves upon a horned animal; some grasped
the head, others the legs and tail. Thus
they upended him, and then fell in a strug-
gling heap. Maddened horses lashed out
with flying heels that missed, by inches, the
place where the addled brains were, or
broke into the mob, bucking wildly; escaped
bullocks were galloped after through avenues
of wedged insanity, barely wide enough for
the harried animals to pass; while what
police were available, aided by attaches of
the show, struggled desperately with lassos
and lines of rope to keep the pressing thou-
sands back sufficiently far to allow room for
so much of the advertised programme as
was given. And not a solitary lunatic
was killed, and only two or three suffered
minor injuries! The only explanation pos-
sible is that given for George V. being king
and defender of the faith —the grace of God.

R. A. Roberts, the quick-change artist at
Sydney Tivoli, who, alone and unaided so
far as the acting is concerned, races through
a Dick Turpin play for five characters, can-
not appear as two characters simultane-
ously ; but he treads so close on his own
heels that the excitable spectator is kept
more or less on the jump lest the impossible
should happen. Roberts tells a press in-
terviewer that if he takes less than 2sec.
over a change he feels hurried, but he can do
it comfortably in 2fsecs.; and, to a slow
dresser like the writer, who takes from 10 to
15 minutes, a splendid time-saving feat like
that is a matter for reverence. Roberts
changes his voice and manner with his
clothes, and the bewilderingly rapid trans-
formations are startlingly complete. In
spite of his own common-sense and the pro-
gramme, the onlooker occasionally is on the
point of calling out to the artist to scoot to
avoid arrest by himself. It is asserted on
good authority that a leader-writer on a
State Fright daily, who has sapped his rea-
soning powers by warning the voters of the
State (as New South Welshmen) against
themselves (as citizens of the Common-
wealth), fainted with nervousness last Sat-
urday night, and, even after being revived
with a phial of Cotter water, refused to be-
lieve that there was really no danger of a
collision between Roberts and Roberts. Flor-
ence Challis, Cooper and Lait, Alexander
Prince, Tristram Greene and the Pounds
girls are the other upholders of the bill.
Lucia Collins is due to depart at the end of
this week.

The Easter bun and Wirth Brothers’ Cir-
cus are to again descend together upon Syd-
ney. The Circus Reason will open at Prince
Alfred Park on April 1. A good programme
and a fine menagerie are promised, and the
little boy from Manly will have an oppor-
tunity to see some big game, including the
hippopotamus that sweats blood—no doubt
at the thought of the land tax. The pro-
gramme includes, as usual, equestrian, acro-
batic, dry-dog and other animal turns. The
stars have been picked from all over the
world, and should help to keep bright the
reputation which the Wirths have always
had in Sydney.

“Woman and Wine” is prospering at the
King’s (Melbourne), as it ever did at the
Royal in days of old, when Bland Holt mas-
queraded in an Eton jacket, and Mrs. Bland
shared his parentage of a lawful but em-
barrassing Baby. This paper last week
spoke of Brown as the successor to Holt’s
portion of the comic relief. It was a
rather cruel misstatement, seeing that
Brown repeats himself in his own original
character of the Baby’s grandfather—a pre-
posterous old person, who hides his unmiti-
gated baldness under a cheap wig, and car-
ries caricature to the last inch of the ex-
treme limit. Seriously considered, the
“comic” scenes in “Woman and Wine” are
much more shocking than the lurid scenes
of vice, and more saddening than the spec-
tacle of a blind father maundering after his
lost Dick. The one amusing character is
Caliban, and the only exceptions to the rule
ot unreality are Alphonse and his devoted
demi-mondaine, La Colombe. None of
the others leave any footprints on the
sands of truth. The gaudy bellow-
drama puts them in false positions, where
they can merely act their hardest, and hope for
effective results. Walter Baker, as the dis-
reputable hero, seems nowadays quite old
enough to know better than to be beguiled
by Miss Rigadout; but he is forceful in his
wrath, and doubtless he would look a more
probable creature of circumstances if the
Woman with the Marble Heart had a
softer surface. Unfortunately, her manner
is Milestone, and her accents suggest cold
steel. Next Saturday the company will
revive "In London Town,” with Baker in
the leading part—Maxwell, its young “lead”
and manager, having passed over since last
issue.

The panto, closes its long innings at Her
Majesty’s on Saturday night, after which
the Juvenile Opera Co. takes the stage in
“The Geisha.” When the departure of the
panto, was first announced, it was said to
be going to change places with “Our Miss
Gibbs”; but seemingly the musical comedy
will hang on to its Sydney success a while
longer, and in that case the Easter offering
at Her Majesty’s will be “A Waltz Dream.”

To-night (Thursday) is the last of “Lncky
Durham” at the Royal. In comparison
with plain balderdash bellowdrama, “Dur-
ham” is a bright play, and Melbourne will
remember it with gratitude. To-morrow
brings one performance of “Struck Oil,” and
an equally brief revival of Maggie Moore.
On Saturday the Arcadians Co. returns to
its old haunt with the “Belle of Brittany,”
late of Sydney.

At the Princess’s they have finished a
highly remunerative week of “East Lynne.”
In the guise and disguise of Lady Isabel, the
Woman who Did, willowy Miss Ross gave an
artistic rendering of the solo weep, supported
by a female chorus ,in front of the house.
It was a week of earnest woe and good busi-
ness. Probably the tears incidental to this
wettest of dramas might have gone on run-
ning for a month, but the management had
arranged for “A Message from Mars,” and
the regeneration of our young friend, Horace
Parker, is not proceeding. Horace, who
appears as Gregan McMahon on the bill,
was to resume his subscription to the doc-
trine of Otherdom last night (Wednesday).
The Bulletin trusts that Melbourne will
benefit by his example until further notice.

The Football Dogs, now at the Opera
House, are almost as dear to the Melbourne
multitude as the previous dogs that
used to hop into a pub and shout
for Dan. Their rough-and-tumble con-
test is a large feature of the Rickards
bill, and the legerdemain feats of Leipzig
rank as only second in attractiveness, though
they are absolutely wonderful in dexterity.
For the rest of the turns there are the tune-
ful Columbia Comedy Trio, Miss Spark,
Frank Harwood, Fanny Powers, etc. The
Wild West acrobats have departed, together
with Ethel Loftus, the poetic balladist,
whose allusions to poor old father used to
break up the house.

At West’s Palace, Melbourne, the Sydney
Sirens ai*e the latest dissipation. Over 30
girls are shown in a lengthy film, and their
charms are various, sweet and plentiful.
Quite apart from the sirens, however, West
is engaging the eye with a fine set of pic-
torial fibs. On Saturday there was an as-
tounding story of Pilikerton, the detective,
who performed a most improbable deed in a
highly impossible way. Incidentally, also,
there were selections by West’s orchestra,
which played Rachmaninoff’s “Prelude,”
among other pleasing things.

WOLFE’S
SCHNAPPS.
Buttered cowboy is the most popular
at Prakran’s new Lyric (Vic.). Ihe loca
gentry rage for the cowboy hlms,
dramas in color are also in danger or ex i
ing approval. Last Saturday the tale o
“The Page and Fair Lady” was generally
accorded a vote of thanks. The film was by
Path<§ FrSres; the principal actress wars the
beauteous Robinne, of the Comedie 1 raI V
caise; and the yarn was about passion and
poison, love philtres, fools and rogues. Inis
w'eek the star item is a tinted production
called “Cain and Abel,” in which a bit ot
Cenesis is given, with all the thrill ot Reve-
lation.

Amusements in Adelaide are hardly excit-
ing just now. New items at the Tivoli are
mostly song-and-dauce, and there is nothing
that rouses an audience to ecstatic yelling
like the recent American Dancers’ team did.
The Empire is starring a past bushranger,
“Midnight.” West’s rely mainly on a fu-
ture ditto, “The Pirates of 1920” —a fine
film. The Empire, jun., at Port Adelaide,
has secured snapshots of 15 local_ babies, and
polling for a five-guinea prize is going on
briskly. Dampier, at the Dandies, is back
from a visit to Melbourne; _ the personal
popularity of this small co. is tremendous.
Prof. Mills has dropped in at the Exhibi-
tion and lectured. He said some sensible
things, but he gave offence by a tendency to
assume that any seemingly-respectable Labor-
man in the audience who interjects a com-
ment must be a “drunken loafer.” But per-
haps the most striking show of the week has
been that of two ladies in exaggerated
“harem” skirts, who were set to stroll about
in a draper’s window, to the immediate and
continued blocking of Rundle-street.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The young manager whom the Blandolt melodrama
knew as Max Max,well transpired on his death certificate
last week as Maximilian Franz Rumpff, native of Tas-
mania, aged 35. Death treated him badly. He had made
up his mind y'ears ago to come out as a manager ; and
Blandolt’s retirement gave him his chance. Less than
six months after bis ambition had been realised appendi-
citis called for him. He had really good stuff in him,
and, with a fairly well filled old stocking, had an excel-
lent chance of winning through.
Henry Bracy’s wife—the Clara Thompson of other Aus-
tralian days—has scored a good engagement in America,
and is likely to get a strong position on the Yankee stage.
After appearing in a N’York play, produced by Charles
Frohmann, she was booked by Dan Frohmann for “ The
Seven Sisters,” which started at the Lyceum in January.
Whilst she was rehearsing her part she was re-engaged by
the other Frohmann for the first production of his next
season in N’York. Evidently the experienced artist is in
demand. The Frohmanns must have sized her up as
being quite It for certain characters. Meanwhile her son
Sydney—remembered in Australia as a bright Bracy
junior—is doing good things and making a name for him-
self in the land of the Meat Trust.
“ Exile ” (from Fogville, 20/2/’ll): Our old friend, Count
Hannibal Asche, was “ butting ” through his 150th scrap
at the Garrick Theatre last night. This romantic con-
geries of noises, in four acts, is about the best thing
Oscar has done in this City of Dreadful Day, and has
established his fame as quite the leading actor on the
London stage. His contemporaries are growing elderly,
and Asche stands in the place where merit entitles him
to promotion. Lily Brayton, looking as much thinner as
Oscar appears stouter than when they left to visit the
Best Country, is acting just as conscientiously as usual.
Caleb Porter and Herbert Grimwood and lan Penny all
seem to have benefited by the lighter air of Sydney’ and
Melbourne; and Elfrida Clement very nearly makes up
for the absence of Constance Robertson.
“Gwy ”: Apropos London’s “ Mdlle. Golda,” who used
to be Australia’s Miss Golder-Olarke. She was a former
resident of Groperland ; and either she or a fertile press-
agent is responsible for the picturesque yarn that, when
living on one of the goldfields with her brothers, her
singing so charmed the wild miners of those parts that
one day, as a surprise gift, they sent her a grand piano.
Her voice was good enough to attract Melba’s notice, and
it was on the diva’s advice that she went to Fogtown ;
and it was the same lady’s influence that secured for her
the subsequent attentions of Marchesi.
Julian Rose, who has been giving Australian audiences
Levinsky during the last few months, threatens to come
back with a company of his own. Although he finds
vaudeville a paying gutter, his artistic soul hankers after
“ straight ” business.
The mail confirms the cable that Marie Lohr, the pretty
and clever little Australian who has got London by its
love-locks, has finally decided not to marry actor Lor-
raine, the pro. who rides an aeroplane. Marie, it seems,
objected to taking to husband a person who goes up one
moment a sound, substantial man, and may come down
the next with no more individuality than a scrambled
egg; and, as Robert declined to break himself of the
habit of flying, the engagement is off, and Marie re-
mains a Lohr unto herself.
“L.H.P.”: “The Whip” represents the latest thing in
Drury Lane dramas of modern life, a vein which was first
worked in the Easter of 1867, when Chatterton produced
Andrew Halliday’s “ The Great City.” This introduced
views of St. Paul’s, Westminster, Charing Cross, etc., and
a realisation of Frith’s famous picture, “The Railway
Station.” This piece, which showed a scene with burg-
lars escaping from a housetop by means of telegraph
wires, enjoyed a great run, and brought much money to
Chatterton’s pocket. A real horse and cab in one of the
scenes was a chief draw. Mrs. Kendal—pretty Madge
Robertson —was the heroine. Till then Chatterton had
pinned his faith chiefly to Samuel Phelps in Shakspeare,
Byron and Scott. In the autumn of 1869, Dion Bouci-
cault came along with “Formosa,” and turned Drury
Lane into a gold mine—for a season, anyway. The play
worked the then novel idea of showing the inner life of a
demi-mondaine. Mrs. Grundy screeched, but it all helped
the money-boxes. Boucicault wrote a letter to the
press defending “Formosa,” but it appeared under
Chatterton’s name. In it occurred the now well-
worn phrase “Shakspeare spells ruin and Byron bank-
ruptcy,” which so annoyed Phelps that he quarrelled
with Chatterton, and left Drury Lane. Chatterton went
back to the silks and satins and ruffles and doublets of
bygone periods, and did poorly. Boucicault, with his
brand new “ Shaughraun ” (1875), was a perfect god send.
This netted over £14,000. The prison scene (on wheels),
which turned itself inside out, apparently without human
agency, was then considered a great stage feat. Like
many of Boucy’s ideas, it was borrowed from the French.
With a woodenheadedness that proved his ruin, Chatter-
ton, in 1876, reverted to Shakspeare and Barry Sullivan.
Harris, later on Sir Augustus, wiser in his generation,
played “ The World,” and never looked back. This
was in 1880. Druriolanus gave forerunners of “The
Whip” in “A Run of Luck,” “The Prodigal Daughter,”
“The Derby Winner” and “A Million of Money”—all
fine sporting dramas. In 1888 he ventured into “cos-
tume” beliowdrama, and put up “The Armada,” to be
succeeded later on by “The Royal Oak," in which the ill-
fated Dacres appeared, and “A Sailor’s Knot,” the last-
named being the only one of the three to be done in Aus-
tralia. But, bar these three, the knight of Drury Lane
preferred to dress his characters in modern clothes and
give us racecourses, Maxim guns, etc., in lieu of tourna-
ments and halberds. Coffins, the present Drury Lane
magnate, is carrying on the Harris tradition, and the
reign of “The Whip” class of drama seems to be assured
fora time.
“ Motdtbarns ” : Before William IV., as Duke of Clar-
ence, abandoned Mrs. Jordan, the actress, he wanted to
reduce her allowance of £lOOO a year. It was then she
tore off the bottom of the Drury Lane playbill, with the
“No Money Returned ” remark, and sent it to him. She
had 130 a week at Drury Lane. Her daughters and a
horde of dependents consumed all her cash. The agree-
ment with which she parted from William, on a sort of
pension, stipulated that she was not to reappear on the
stage. The pension was small, so she broke this stipula-
tion in anxiety to provide for the Ford daughters, and
the allowance was cut off. She died in poverty in France.
Clarence went and married sweet young Adelaide, one of
the ever-ready Made-in-Germany—the lady after whom
the S. Australian capital is called. There was all the
solemn mumbo-jumbo of holy matrimony, with the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop of London, and so
forth, rejoicing in the venerable prodigal having re-
turned to the right path. The Jordan progeny were the
10 fine and stout Fitzclarences. Adelaide produced for
him two sickly little daughters, both of whom died in
infancy. Some readers may have seed a nauseous statu-
ette of them, reposing together, at Windsor Castle. I
expect bluff King Ned kicked the horror into the
coal-hole.
“ Busk ”: J. C. Williamson got “ The Bluebird ”
quickly after its London production. He had then
almost given orders for it to come along ; but on reading
the book, he was astounded. It would be certain to
prove a frost. So he hung the thing up. Months later,
in Sheffield, he saw it acted, with the unfailing public
enthusiasm which has greeted it throughout Russia,
France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain and America.
Immediately he plumped for it, and it is to come. Of
course, Australian children could do as well as the
English, and probably better ; but the snobbish public
gives the law, and insists on the English, you know. So
English kiddies are to evince their genius in Sydney and
Melbourne.
The Pantzer acrobats have introduced a “gag” into
their wonderful performance in the Williamson panto.
If it isn’t new to the acrobatic business it is new to the
panto, stage, and it makes a fool of the audience every
time. The smallest boy Pantzer appears to be supporting
his inverted parent, head to head. The youngster wears
a pained expression ; his legs tremble, and his body seems
to be getting crumpled under the weight. Excited per-
sons in the audience are bound to hiss this display ; it
looks so cruel to the nipper. Then he moves away, and
Pantzer, senior, is seen to be balancing himself on his
head on an iron support which had been concealed fioni
view.
“Snell”: I’m afraid the living picture craze must
serve to increase the democratic disrespect for royalties.
At one show I ducked into the other evening, the spectacle
of the royal Boss moving in procession to open Parlia-
ment provoked a disloyal yelp that must have turned the
whiskers of every right-thinking citizen a shade greyer.
The public demonstration was derogatory to the Boss, but
it was provoked by the vehicle he was caged in, a tre-
mendous cross between a Joss House and a pantomime
glory-waggon, drawn by 14 huge grey' horses. No king
with any sense of humor would consent to ride in that
vehicle ; no man with any respect for himself would figure
as an adjunct to a perambulating Chinese pagoda.
“Propstick”: A mention of Billy Hoskins in my last
Bulletin starts me off at a tangent. In my' opinion, he
was not much of an actor. He had just one manner. In
some respects he was like Titheradge, but with none of
Titheradge’s variety and suavity. Yet Irving sent £lOO
to Hoskins, in Australia, as an acknowledgment of ser-
vices rendered in tuition in London. Hoskins wanted to
bring Irving to Australia in 1856, before Irving’s first
appearance on the stage. I am told Irving would have
come but for his mother having a rooted objection to his
appearing on the stage at all. Hoskins had been engaged
by' Phelps at Sadlers Wells, and succeeded as Lucio, in
“ Measure for Measure.” He came to Australia with his
wife, Julia Harland, and the English Opera Co. of which
she was prima-donna. They opened at the Melbourne
Olympic with “ Maritana,” then play'ed for the first time
in Melbourne, and a farce in which Hoskins appeared.
He was much identified with Australian and Maoriland
management afterwards, and brought out, among others,
Marie St. Denis and Florence Colville. At last he
descended to acting Gaffer Pottle in Melbourne’s first
“ Silver King,” but was promoted to Jaikes. He married
at an advanced age, and left a very y'oung son in Mel-
bourne. What became of that son ?
“ Snell ” : Harry Roberts told a Melbourne interviewer
that ever since he first saw “Lucky Durham” it had
been his ambition to play John, the “ ille-jim,” who goes
to America, makes millions, and returns to give his
bastard father, the British peer, a frightful swat with his
almighty dollars. What an ambition ! “Lucky Durham”
is cheap and trite in every department, and the late
Barrett’s tremendous fulminations on the question of
society’s attitude towards the girl who was naughty once
sound like an earnest leaderette from the Boobiebinalong
Tri-weekly Bannerette. Henry’s chief defect in repre-
senting Durham is a defect of his quality. In such parts
he will persist in squeezing an unctuous kind of Sunday-
school superintendent’s sweetness into voice and action,
which sacchariferous method imparts the idea of a nice
young Wesleyan doctor employing his best bedside
manner to soothe the brave little woman who is about to
have her toe-n ail amputated.
Motoring in New Zealand.
A well-known motorist in New Zealand, when
writing to a relative in Sydney, says the British
car, Wolseley, a product ofVickers, Son & Maxim,
is fast displacing its foreign competitors. Such
news as this should be welcome to every ardent
Britisher, as it is about time a British car should
command a good market in a British country.
According to the latest English paper, the”same
make of car is scoring with equal success in South
Africa, India and the Argentine.*
“ Klifton Dancing, 10 till 12. Blank and Blank’s
Band.” This is the inscription commonly seen on tickets
and programmes issued for a “ social evening ” and
dance. Part II of the statement often proves mislead-
ing. It gives one to understand that the music is to be
supplied by an orchestra, the principals of which are the
aforesaid Messrs. Blank and Blank, whereas it turns out
that the “band” consists of a pianist and a violinist.
Please invent a new word to describe “ bands ” of this
nature.
“Stargazer”: It is, I think, a grievous misfortune of
our time that one can no longer escape from actors by
refraining from going to theatres; and my intention in
writing this is to invite our legislators to gravely consider
the necessity of establishing a close season forcomedians,
arid to prohibit actors from performing out of hours and
off their licensed premises.
“ Varden”: Dickens first shone as an actor in private
theatricals at Government House, Canada, as Alfred
Highflyer in “A Roland for an Oliver.” Mrs. Dickens
also excelled in that performance; yet she took an
animosity to his theatricals. She disliked his association
with Fechter, and was furiously jealous of Miss Ternan,
an actress who appeared in some of the plays with him.
His best successes were in “The Frozen Deep,” “The
Lighthouse,” “Every Man in His Humor,’’Bulwer’s “Not
so Bad as We Seem,” and the farces of “Annual Mag-
netism ” and “ Love, Law and Physic.”
Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes snake-story, “The
Speckled Band,” has been revived in London before Aus-
tralia gets a chance of seeing it. An india-rubber serpent
continues to play the leading part, but Sherlock is played
by the actor from Adelaide, Otto Heggie.
“ Theorbo ” : The regular London opera season for the
Coronation is to whip everything. The ballet, a hundred
strong, is coming from the St. Petersburg opera. They
give seven ballets, lengthy and superb, such as the ballet
used to be in the spicy time of Taglioni, Cerito, and so
forth. This St. Petersburg ballet was in Paris last season.
“ Earthworm ” : A casual reference to Madame Celeste
leads me to muse on how overwhelmingly popular her
dramas of “The Green Bushes” and “Flowers of the
Forest,” both by Buckstone, used to be in every mining
centre of N. S. Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Maoriland.
Celeste herself visited Sydney and Melbourne. What
rattling plays were these two! Also her “ House
on the Bridge of Notre Dame” was far superior to the
weatherboard dramas of to-day. As with “The Colleen
Bawn ” and “ Octoroon,” the sensations arose naturally.
Root up “The Flowers of the Forest” and “Green
Bushes.” They would electrify. The great favorites of
Ballarat and Bendigo in these fine pieces were Kate
O’Reilly and Kate Warde.
London is becoming annoyed with Pinero and his
Pinerotics. His recent drama, “ Preserving Mr. Pan-
niure,” has startled the critics into exclamations. Some
dislike the play on technical grounds, but nearly all
object to the character of Mr. Panmure, a giddy old buck
whom any fast woman would employ as collaborateur in
a Past. He has thoroughly alarmed the London Daily
News, which describes him as “ an abject and disgusting
figure, and not least of all when he appears in the last act
as penitent.” A writer in the Saturday Review is
equally shocked: “Of course, one does not take him
(Panmure) as a serious piece of characterising—he is a
fortuitous bunch of obscenities. But the very over-
elaboration of these obscenities filled one with repulsion
which defeated the object of the farce.” Other com-
petent authorities suggest, more or less, that he ought
to be poisoned or boiled—as a sacrifice, presumably, to
the delusion that his type is extinct.
“Char”: “Electric Theatres” are a sign of the times
in London and environs. As far out as Finchley, on the
Great York (North) road, of Dick Turpin memory, an up-
to-date “ Electric ”is being: run up. Before I left recently
a deserted chapel in the Hampstead-road, a hundred
yards from the famous old Priory, was knocked about a
bit by the masons and converted—into an “Electric!”
I went, out of curiosity. The “congregation” was large,
and the “plate” well patronised at threepence or six-
pence a time. Churches being transformed into theatres !
Is this a sign of the times also? And will the Rev. Ahdam
Fairgusson put this down to too much fog? What a pity
Providence didn’t have a Scots meenister-guide on hand
when He was building the wurruld !
“Araemo”: “Whips of Blood” (B. 23/2/T1) questions
whether picturegraphs elevate. He seems to think they
don’t. I don’t say they all do ; but, anyway, they are, in
the lump, less keen on the bloodstain than the daily
papers or the Bilanderson drama. I saw the picture
instanced by “Whips of Gore,” showing the accident
which caused the death of two aviators, and could find in
it no cause for a howl of protest. It showed the aviators
before commencing their last flight, the machine rising
gracefully into the air, then the sudden rush to earth.
This last was apparently taken from a distance of at least
a couple of hundred yards ; so the gore-lovers in the audi-
ence could see nothing of the look of agony, weird expect-
ancy, or whatever else aviators usually wear while awaiting
the inevitable dull, sickening thud. Then officials were
shown running up to gather the pieces ; but when they
actually started to shift the wreck, the picture-man
thoughtfully stopped turning the handle. In fact,
though I’m a fairly regular patron of the “ pictures,” so
far the only thing I have seen on the screen that made
me feel at all queer was a Frenchman eating snails. He
certainly was not elevating. He was putting ’em down.
Bert Levy, the Australian who turned his talent as a
black-and-white draughtsman to music-hall showmanship,
and has struck it rich in America and Britain, tells a good
story of H. A. Jones, the playwright. On the steamer
crossing from England to N’York a stout lady swooped
down upon the gloomy author, autograph book in hand.
“Oh, Mr. Jones, I did so enjoy your lovely pla}' ‘The
Whip ’; and, as for ‘ The Importance of Being Ernest,’ it
was just too bully.” Jones gravely took the woman’s
precious book and wrote a quotation from Raleigh and
Hamilton’s melodrama and a quotation from Oscar
Wilde’s comedy, with the author’s name in large letters
at the bottom of each. Then he wrote his own name in
very small letters and handed the whole outfit back to
the gusher.
Under the advice of his man-milliners,
George V. has decided to wear at his Coronation
the purple mantle in which George IY. was
crowned. William IV., who hated the Coronation
humbug, wore just anything. Queen Victoria
had a mantle made. So did Edward Vll.—a very
fine piece of millinery, with the badges of
England, Scotland and Ireland embroidered by
hand. It appears that the mantle of George IV.
has only just turned up. It was put away in a
cedar glory-box, and comes out fresh as a daisy.
Flurried cable from London :
The Bight Rev. Dr. Ingram, Bishop of London, has
made a remarkable announcement.
As an example to the other clergy, he had practically
decided to abandon his see, with its salary of £lO,OOO a
year, and offer himself for missionary service in Canada.
After three months of earnest prayer, howevi r, it was
revealed to him that his work in London had prior claims
on his energies, and he had determined to remain.
The cable-man no doubt went on to say that,
nevertheless, Dr. Ingram had decided to live for
the future on £l5O a year; so that, though he
couldn’t go a-missionarying himself, £9850 a year
would be available to support a few dozen who
could go. But some thoughtless shark evidently
bit off that end of the message.
One fact in connection with the Referenda
campaign cannot be hammered in often enough.
The Excise Act, the Seamen’s Compensation Act,
the Arbitration Act, and other Acts passed by
the Australian Parliament, and since declared,
wholly or in part, unconstitutional, were all passed
by men who are now bitterly opposing the Refer-
enda proposals. One object of the proposals is to
give the Commonwealth Parliament power to
enact these measures, which power Deakin and Co.
thought they had when they passed the measures.
The Reid Government put railway servants under
the Arbitration Act. Cook was a member of that
Government. Yet to-day he goes squealing
everywhere that it is proposed to give the Federal
Parliament power over State railway servants !
State Frights’ yarn that the proposal to
give the Commonwealth control of industrial
matters is a wild Labor idea is an unconvincing
narrative. As far back as 1901 Higgins, in the
House of Representatives, was responsible for a
motion embodying the idea ; and the proposition
was supported by Edmund Barton and W. McMil-
lan, neither of them very prominent Laborites.
Said McMillan : “ Everything that affects the in-
dustrial life of the community ought to be in the
hands of the National Parliament.” Since then,
however, McMillan has been reminded that the
National Parliament represents the people, while
one House in every State Parliament represents
only the Fat part of the people ; so, in the inte-
rests of government by Fat, McMillan has changed
his tune. Which makes it quite clear that the
Referenda issue is really government by the
People versus government by the Houses of Fat
Landlords.
In the last lot ol very over-ripe Customs
frauds ventilated in a Sydney court it came out
that the importer, who had brought in £54,000
worth of motor-cars during the last three
or four years, had helped to work his swin-
dle by ordering from a Sydney printery a
stack of invoice-forms headed with the
names of the English makers of the cars.
Then, on these forms, he calmly understated the
value of his imports, and thus saved duty amount-
ing to £4500. This looks like the straight tip to
the Customs people to acquire power (if they
haven’t got it already) to compel all printers to
furnish particulars of orders for the supply of
»in voice-forms to any person whatever ; or, failing
that, a regulation requiring foreign invoices to be
so marked or stamped that it would be impossible
for a local importer to procure faked ones.
R. C. Baker, lately dead in Adelaide, was
the first native-born S. Australian to push right
to the front in his province. He was the first to
be elected to the Assembly ; the first to be elected
to the Leg. Council; the first to hold office in a
Ministry, and to be President of the Council.
And, later on, he was first President of the
Commonwealth Senate. Yet he had a lot of
“ You-be-damnedness ” about him, and was
never really popular. He was in Parliament
at 26, refused a Q.C.-ship at 28, and at the
same age took part in a “double” that remains
unique, he and his father carrying a want-of-
confidence vote against the S.A. Ministry of the
moment in the two Houses of Parliament on
the same day. Like his lifelong enemy, Kingston,
he was fond of sport. His father was a prominent
racing owner, and R. C. Baker, having been chair-
man of the old Jockey Club, was the man who in
1888 pushed a Totalisator Act through the local
Legislature, and so made the revival of racing
possible. Hd was president of the new S. A.J.C.
from that year till 1909.
THE CHORISTER AND HER “BUY."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a chorus-maiden fair,
Pure gold without alloy :
Her angel-visage shone with pride
And undiluted joy,
What time she introduced me to
Her very latest “boy.”
I grabbed the happy lover’s hand
And wrung it eagerly ;
“ You are a lucky lad,” I cried,
“ A priceless jewel she—
Fit mate for health and youth." He gazed
In wonderment at me.
And then I gazed at him. Ye gods !
His wizened visage wore
A thousand marks that told of eld :
The weight of years he bore
Had bowed his back and stripped his skull.
He might have been four-score.
watched him dodder off beside
Her form of perfect poise,
Then scribbled in a book, whose truths
Afford me endless joy's :
“How wonderful are chorus-girls—
Their boys are always boys. ”

THE FALL OF SHAKSPEARE, W.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Anglo-American : The Tongue that Shakspeare Spake.
—Cheerful headings from daily paper.
Shakspeare ? Sure !
Say, but you Britishers state Shakspeare grew
At Stratford city, Eng. Not on your life !
William J. Shakspeare was a free-born Yank,
And hung his sign in little old Ne’ York :
“ Shak’s Dime The-ay-ter and Saloon combined.”
Sakes, but the old boy was a hustler ! Gee,
Bill for the Hot Air when the show began !
He’d stage his own durned notion of a Play,
A Drammer—one to make the hobos whoop
And all the citizens of Bowery roar !
The press mutts served him sorry in their tales,
But hully gee ! That cut no ice with Bill.
“ Good goods? ” he'd reckon. “ None of it in mine !
Me for the bloodstains and old Caesar’s ghost
Or Richard Three, the crank, pig-stuck by Rich. ! ”
Wal, now, next fall
Colonel F. Bacon stacked the cards on Shak.
He built a theatre-biograph next door,
And up-to-dated old-man Bill’s own stunts—
Say, color-filmed his drammers out of sight 1
Julius H. Caesar, played by Path6’s “ Max,”
And Foolshead doing stunts as Ro-me-o ;
Iced soda-fountains and electric band ;
Continuous show, with phonographs a-blare,
And rag-time coon-songs in the interval !
It flattened Shak.
It gave him “ Nothing Doing,” night by night;
Till in the end he loaded up with rye,
And called in on the Colonel with his gun :
Missed five times, shot himself, and took the count.
The Colonel, ca’rn, collected, got it all,
Turning the handle of the Biograph,
And chewing gum. Next night he stars it big :
“ William J. Shakspeare Does His Final Stunt!
Assassinator Filmed while in the Act! 1
Special to Colonel F., colored by Hand ;
Five Thousand Feet of Blood and Butchery 11”
And say ! He made a hit right there with Shak.
That made his Safe Deposit fairly bulge. . ..
Shakspeare? Sure!
You’ll find his figger in the dime museems,
Murderers’ section. .. . Could I wet my speak?
Toe be or not toe be —that is the Proposition ?
Mine for a highball! .. . Bud, we’ll liquor some.

SOCIETY
“ Konini ” : Maorilanders are grieving for
the death of old “ Pelorus Jack,” the pilot fish of
the French Pass, which occurred last week, ror
over 20 years P.J. regularly met the steamers
passing to and fro between Wellington and Nel-
son, and was better known to passengers than
the oldest skipper in the trade. He belonged to
the dolphin tribe, was about 14ft. in length, bluish
white in color, and was protected by Act
of Parliament. I don’t know bis age, often
as I have seen him; but it must have
been considerable if Maori legend is to be be-
lieved. According to that, John used to pilot the
canoes passing along the coast years before the
white man arrived. The most romantic incident
in the creature’s career was the assistance he gave
a Maori girl of high degree to swim 30 miles
across Cook Strait. This young woman, whose
name was Hinepoupou or Kiuapoupou, married a
South Island chief who soon tired of her, and
decided to get rid of her. So he planned a picnic
to Kapiti Island, on the opposite side of
the strait, and there marooned the lady with two
hounds that accompanied her. There was only one
way to get home, so Hine stepped out of her mat
into the sea and started. The dogs wouldn t
face the water and were promptly turned into
stone. Tamati, who told me about it, says they
are there yet. Anyhow, Hine swam on, buoyed
by the gods of the period, with whom her manu
was great, and also by a fierce desire for revenge.
Pelorus Jack either heard her prayers or was
rung up and told to put to sea, and, meeting the
lady about half-way across, gave her his arm for
the rest of the journey. When she reached home
her husband and the bulk of his relatives were
out fishing, so she said a piece to the gods which
so enraged those gentlemen that they sooled a
storm on to the fishing canoes and drowned all
hands. Whereat Hine spat into the sea and said,
“ Pai rawa atu,” which, being translated broadly,
means, “Good enough for the cows!”
“ Crass ” demands a gun :
In Walter Murdoch’s interview with the late George
Meredith (Lone Hand, August 2, 11)09), Meredith—deep
thinker, keen observer, and great man though he was —
erred when he remarked, anent possibilities of trouble
between Japan and Australia, that “Australians can
ride and shoot.” Australians can’t shoot. in my
locality there is a population of, say, 30,000, and as re-
gards physique I know of no liner collection of male
adults; but that doesn’t make them good shots, nor
remove the fact that nine-tenths of them cannot ride.
Not that the riding part matters so much ; what
Australia needs is men who can walk well and far, shoot
straight at all ranges, and endure hardships. I know
scores of first-class “sport” shots—bunny, duck and ’roo
killers, pigeon murderers, etc.—brilliant shots at any-
thing up to 80yds. or so, who couldn’t bet on hitting an
ordinary town hall at 200yds. with their own weapon or
any modern military service rifle. I’m satisfied that when
the call comes these men will he willing enough to go into
the lines, but it’s a pity to waste them. I’d be charmed
to nail the following suggestion on the end of the Minister
for Defence’s nose : Afford ever facility for every adult
Australian to learn how to use in the most deadly manner
the best possible service rifle at all ranges. There will he no
lack of volunteers to learn. If the Minister retorts that
the rifle clubs are open to those men, I reply that the
conditions attached to the rifle clubs are too exclusive
and restrictive for thousands of good Australians who are
anxious not to he “ pot-hunters,” but to he on such terms
with a rifle that the exchange of international discour-
tesies will not be all one-sided.
* * * #
Said the biograph operator :
We were showing in a M.L. prohibition town down
south, and stopping at a temperance hotel. There wasn't a
sign of liquor of any sort about the place, and it seemed
to live up to its name until one night after the show, on
returning to the hotel, I struck up a conversation.with a
local squatter. Presently he said: “Gould you do a
drink?” Gould I what! So the squatter hanged the
gong, and the boots came in. The squatter said to him :
“ You will find a couple of bottles of beer in my room ;
bring them in.” Sure enough the hoots found them. B.y
tliis time the forces had been increased by the arrival of
the statiomnaster, who helped to unload the bottles,
which being done he hit the gong, and when the hoots
again appeared, said : “ You will find a couple of bottles
of beer in my room ; bring them in.” Well, they were
brought and finished. It then looked plainly up to me,
but 1 didn’t know how I was going to get on, because I was
dead certain there were no two bottles in my room. Any-
how, I thought I would chance it; so 1 banged the gong,
and when the barman—l mean boots—came iiq I
remarked casu illy : “ You might bring those two bottles
of beer from my room.” And he did! I went to bed
that night with my boots on. When the boss saw the
item, “ Refreshments, 105.,” on the bill, he asked me what
it meant. I told him I thought it must be some tea and
pancakes that I had had ; to which lie replied that it was
extravagant. I said I thought so too.
THE ARMORED SEX.
THE RICH RELATION.
AUGUSTUS: “ Wot's ’Arry so dashed pleased about?:
RUPERT: “ Ain't yer 'card? His missus bolted with old Brown , the bank manager , last night,
an’ ’Arry reckons ’e's a relative o’ Brown's now.”
The discovery that the group of islands
known as the Three Kings (M.L.), lying north-
west of Cape Reinga (the place, according to
Maori legend, where the souls of the dead leap
into another world), is nearly two miles south of
the position assigned it on the existing chart, has
given new life to the old demand for a
proper survey of the Maoriland coast. And
not before it is time, either. The chances
are 'that, had those who charted the Kings
not marked them down a clear two miles out of
true posit on, the steamer Elingamite would not
have tripped over them with such disastrous loss
of life on that foggy Sunday morning a little over
eight years ago. The course Captain Attwood
was steering should have taken him well clear of
the cliffs of the West King; but no man can say
where he is going to bring up when great lumps
of land go whaling round in a fog like lost
“drunks” searching a pitch-black alley for
an escaped crayfish. To thoroughly survey
the coast would cost a great deal of money;
to" leave the charting as it is will cost
a great mativ lives besides those already
sacrificed—ar.d " Heaven and- the other place
only know how many they have tallied. A
half-hearted arrangement has been arrived at
whereby the Terra Nova, on her return from de-
positing the Scott expedition ashore en route to
the South Pole, will, prior to going back to the
icefields, survey some of the more doubtful parts
of the coast and fix the true position ; and Joseph
Ward will also have a word with the Admiralty
while he is in London. The difficulty is, as
Millar, the Minister for Marine, points out, the
job will cost money ; but a country that can fool
away thousands to strut at the Coronation ought
to be able to find the money to prevent Elinga-
mite tragedies at its own doorstep.
Chief Secretary Maedonell (N.S.W.)
recently knocked a "hole in a very objectionable
form of monopoly. He decreed that no hospital
keeping a medical monopolist about the premises
need apply when special grants were being handed
out. The decrepit committees of certain country
hospitals have been in the habit of allowing a
usually-antiquated sawbones to run the show.
In such cases the doctor becomes practically the
owner of the institution. No rival medico may
plant his unholy feet in those sacred wards. The
patient must either bow down to the czar, or leave
the premises. At Mudgee. uncivil war on a ques-
tion of this kind recently broke out between
Dunn, M.L.A., and the committee, and the
member wound up by telling the nominal rulers
that they didn’t deserve any special giant. Mac-
donell’s inspiration probably had its source in
Dunn, Dunn being an uncommonly determined
person.
A lack of that nice attention to detail
which is the mark of genius is chiefly responsible
for the retirement for 18 months of a Richmond
(Vic.) tailor named Mishael. Mishael closed his
shop on the last day of the old year, and departed
to Erankaton ; but before going he lit a small gas
jet in the shop and then cut the pipe further on,
the alleged intent being to collect certain insur-
ance moneys. He also plugged the keyholes; but
as he neglected to plug the crevices, the keen-
scented Law perceived the odor—and then trouble
began for Mishael. Even in his excuses he showed
an untidy disregard for detail, as he blamed a man
who, unfortunately, was in Pentridge at the time.
After that explanation had fallen through, Mishael
excused himself from attending court by joining a
Erench boat; but, again, he took the wrong boat.
0. J. Madden spoke severely to the bungler, and
handed him 18 months’ “ hard ’’—which sentence
wasn’t anything like as severe as the remarks that
preceded it.
In Maoriland a new industry has iust
been rooted up for the inspection of the public.
It was first talked about after the Masterton A.
and P. show, when some of the “ squattahs”
who had not been successful roared loudly to the
effect that the prize-winners had so artificially
‘•trimmed,” “oiled” and “colored” their
jutnbucks as to deceive the expert judges. The
successful ones asserted that the attentions to the
great god Mutton were not only legitimate but
necessary. Squatter hurls assertion against
squatter, and the public sits tight and wonders if
there is any trade, bar the hangman’s, that hasu t
got a trick in it. In any case, the term applied
to the faking operation threatens to bang on to
the public’s tongue. Anybody who habitually
polishes up the Ward 10 U programme, and
makes it look fit for inspection, begins to be
known as a “ trimmer and oiler.”
Hobart’s equivalent for the ancient Village
Pump is Walch’s Corner at the intersection of
Liverpool and Elizabeth streets. It is the spot
where more generations of Hobart-towners have
met and yarned and smoked and swapped lies
than any other spot in the village; and it is
reckoned the best business locality in Tasmania.
One of the four corners was sold the other day for
£lB,OOO or so. There are one or two shops on the
ground floor; offices and a small meeting hall up-
stairs. The latter just missed becoming historical
a decade ago as the spot where W.*A. Holman
was murdered for trying to address a meeting
when the Boer war was at its greatest depth. A
crew of men-o’-warsmen crowded into the hall
and sang Bull-dog songs; and Holman only just
managed to escape. Eive minutes more and he
would have be in sung to death.
HYMN NUMBER ONE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Be good to all men all the time
Because it pleases you.
The moral of my simple rhyme
Is cynical, hut true.
No duty’s done for duty’s sake—
This dictum bear in mind :
None give more pleasure than they take
From grateful humankind ;
We play a game of give and take
In serving humankind.
A man does well or otherwise,
According to his whim ;
If meanness, whicli he should despise,
Gomes natural to him,
Why, then he’s mean, and never lets
His conscience cramp his biz,
Or load his heart with vain regrets
For being what he is.
llow can a fellow have regrets
For being what lie is l
Good actions may unselfish seem,
But Heaven knows they ain't.;
“Self-sacrifice" is but the dream
Of Pharisaic saint.
Man suits his actions to his need—
The need of self-content ;
The waster’s waste, the miser’s greed
Is due to moral bent.
The straightest-dealing folk, indeed,
Seek only self-content.
All gallant deeds in love or war
Are selfish in design ;
All brave endeavors, less or more,
With bogus lustre shine.
It’s not because of wife and kids
The toiler digs and delves ;
He does just what his Ego bids.
Men work to suit themselves,
Whilst loafers sigh for wife and kids
And loaf to suit themselves.
So, seeing that ourselves we please
In all we say or do,
Let’s try to put our minds at ease
By pleasing others, too.
Then none will ever fear a foe,
And joy will chase distress,
And each aspiring soul will glow
With noble selfishness.
How warm and comforting the glow
Of high-born selfishness !
O, pity ’tis that parsons speak
Of )' sacrifice ” and sicli,
Prescribing “ self-denial week ”
As physic for the rich ;
Though piously the parson smirks
With pride for what lie’s done,
The only god for whom he works
Is known as Number One.
For good or ill, each mortal works
The will of Number One.
Strive hard to raise the low ideals
Of Number One, the beast 1
Point out to him how nice it feels
To soar in thought , at least.
Who played the rogue, or cad, with ease,

New parts, and learn by slow degrees
To act the gentleman—

To act the gentleman.

But the gentleman with the aggressive side-whiskers

From a man who believes in cremation—
nt the right time :
“ Few things burn up so quickly as a ferry-boat. Take
the case of the Peari—she was burned to the water’s
edge in six minutes.” These are the words of the Sydney
Ferries’ manager, and, as a confirmed ferry traveller, they
don’t make me feel any more comfortable. One morning
last week the big co.’s wooden steamer Kaludah caught
fire, burnt through her mooring lines, and, blazing like a
torch, drifted down the Parramatta River. The watch-
man got off just in time, and the Harbor Trust boat
Pluvius, which does duty in Port Jackson as a marine fire-
engine, steamed at its top and pumped like fury, and
tfius managed to save just enough of the ship for the
press photographers. The usual wail has gone up for a
fire-float. For the 2784th time it is pointed out that the
Pluvius belongs to the Harbor Trust, hasotherduties to at-
tend to, and may be miles away the next time it is wanted
lo throw water over a burning wooden steamer guaranteed
to last only six minutes. Next time, too, there may be
heaps of excursionists instead of one lone watchman to
save. But can’t the Ferries 00. build an ark that will
last more than six minutes? Wood is a beastly thing in
a fire or collision. Some months ago I was on a Sydney
ferry which shouldered one of the pontoon piles in a
friendly way. The bump smashed yards of the wooden
bulwarks and tore away half the sponson, so that the
people on the sea,t outside the cabin were left gazing into
the deep green water of the harbor from a narrow splin-
tered shelf. If the heavy deck rail hadn’t elected to stay
on the pontoon, they would most probably have been
jammed by it against the cabin windows, or knocked in a
stunned condition into the sea. A steel boat would have
steamed off with, at most, a small bulge in one of its
plat< s.
BASE MERCENARIES.
1ST PARTY: "What’s the matter over there?”
2ND DITTO: “ Oh, just an aviator killed.”
1ST DITTO: “ Well, it’s marvellous what those
chaps’ll do to draw a crowd.”
The Salv’army has leased Coulson’s Grand
Hotel, Lydiard-street, Ballarat, and intends to
transform it into a “ People’s Palace*” —a sort of
cheap hash-house, with texts for trimmings. This
recalls a fierce business struggle of the moderately
early days of Ballarat. About 30 years
ago, when the field was booming and
trade roaring, I. Jones had a cheap
eating-house in Ballarat East. OneS.
Cohen started an opposition business
in Lydiard-street, whereupon Jones
rented the premises next door as a
restaurant. Then began a ferocious
war. Prices were cut till they dis-
appeared altogether, and free meals
were given. Then the rivals took
to improving the quality of the free
meals. In the end I. Jones with-
drew, the drain on his capital
being too severe. S. Cohen at
once began to do what the
monopolist always does when he
has had to fight for his monopoly.
Some years afterwards the two
shops were made one, and turned
into a hotel. The rent was £24
a week, and £5OOO was paid for
ingoing. These are the premises
that have just been leased by
the Salv’army. Times have
changed. The rent of Coul-
son’s Hotel was lately £2
weekly, and the Licenses
Reduction Board was told
the other day that the
license had been sur-
rendered.
“ Aqua ” : Four
hundred hotels have
been closed by the
Licenses Reduction
Board in Victoria
si nee 1907 —a verage,
100 a year, and
most of them
shanties. Good
enough! It works
out incompar-
ably better than
local option,
which hardly
ever has a
hope of cleaning out the low-down boozeries
of a big city. Still, there are one or two
inequalities that strike me. For instance, why
should Her Majesty’s and the King’s Theatres
not be allowed to have licensed bars as well as
other places of amusement, or why should they
not all be closed ? As it is, a monopoly is created.
Just imagine the gilt edge of a boozing kennel
alongside the picture theatres of West, Spencer
and Tait, over Princes Bridge ! What a genius a
licensed victualler would have had to pitch long
ago in the wilderness there !
More light was thrown on the contagious
virtues of our “ loyal fellow subjects” by a case in
the Bendigo (Vic.) Police Court last week, when
a constable charged Parget Singh with
threatening to rip him up. Singh had
been having ructions with his female
belongings—his wife, who was a young
white woman ; her mother and his
wife’s two small children. From the
evidence it seems that he had bought a
14-year-old white girl from her mother,
and had subsequently married her; but
he apparently repented of his bar-
gain, so he re-sold the girl to another
llindu,.the father of the two infants.
Being then' shortof a wife, Singh engaged
the mother as his “housekeeper.” It
was a dreadful narrative, and ought to
have got most of the parties 12 months'
gaol on general principles; but appar-
ently the P.M. has a tender feeling
towards black men, so, though Singh
owned up to five prior convictions, the
Court refrained from fining him the £5
it had intended, and only asked him for
405., “on account of the indignity he
had suffered in being handcuffed.”
Considering all things, “indignity” is
distinctly good.
Geelong (Vic.) so far shifted itself recently
as to rise up in anger against the hoary old Cor-
poration Act which has governed it since it first
became a place at all. Lt is about the only place
in Victoria which recognised the Act, and the
only advantage it got was that at civic functions
its mayor was entitled to walk immediately be-
hind the Gawd Mayor, whilst presumably the
mayors of larger places gnashed their teeth with
envy somewhere in the rear. In return for this
concession Geelong has in the past put up with
an Act which provides for aldermen, names a
ridiculously high qualification'for councillors, dis-
franchises many estimable citizens, and gives
Propputty inordinate power. Geelong has just
realised that it would be just as well off if its
mayor was only 97th in the procession, so it lias
thrown over its allegiance to the Corporation Act
by a majority of 645 votes.

A note from a man who sups on history-
books
There is nothing new under the sun —even the harem
skirt is only a revival. Fashion plates of just a century
ago show “ trouserette ” garments more daring and
striking than any displayed to-day. Its vogue came,
along with a good many other .thing, from Napoleon’s
Egyptian and Syrian campaigns. The directoire skirt
(which also has just had a revival among us)
had had its run ; the high-waisted imitation classical
robes, to which the title “Empire ” still clings, had been
exploited out of compliment to the ruler. Further flat-
tery in allusion to French dreams of conquest in “the
East” was intended by the harem skirt. Regarded
purely as a garment, a thing of wear, it is infinitely saner
than the crinoline, the huge bustle of the ’7o’s, or the
trailing germ,carrier and tight-fitting tube of more recent
years. We shall assuredly see much of it, since Paul
Poiret, one of the most ingenious and daring of designeis,
and Doueet are both backing it.

Some good Australians in the N.T. have
been tracking up the parentage of the Aus-
tralian flag which was hoisted when the Terri-
tory was “ proclaimed ” at the beginning of the
year, and they have got enough evidence to
acquit the historic drapery of being Chinese-
made. Tom Crush, ex-M.Ij.A., who hunted up
the flag and got it substituted at the last moment
for one which undoubtedly was of Chow manufac-
ture, has traced it back to Evans, a Melbourne
flag-maker; and Bradshaw, the owner, suppoi ts
this statement of its white parentage. The Aus-
tralian stars were sewn on by a good white Aus-
tralian woman living in Port Darwin.
“ The Snake ” : The quotation (B.
23/3/T1) from J. C. Balet’s book on “Military
Japan, that “it is against the United States of
America that Japan is increasing her naval strength
and taxing her citizens to the breaking point,” was
recently endorsed at Auckland (M.L.) by C. E.
Russell, who was a candidate at the last election
for the New York city mayoralty. Russell figured
it out that the indications of war between the two
countries were never more ominous than at
present. He says that the great factor in the
prospective shindy is the circumstance that
Nippon is undermining Sam’s gigantic trusts. He
gave details :
I believe that Japan, if it cot the chance, could lay
down steel rails on the Pacific coast of America for far
less that the American Steel Trust would do it. Also, in
building great steamships they are ever outrivalling the
United States. Japan has already defied the American
Tobacco Trust, and driven it our, of Japan and Korea and
largely out of China. The Tobacco‘Trust had invested
millions of dollars in building up that trade, but Japan
has outed it absolutely. Then the little yellow men have
hit the Standard Oil Trust very hard by developing their
own oil industry. Even the American Railway Road
Trust has suffered because a big trade in flour was being-
developed with the East, and the grain was carried two-
thirds of the way across the Continent and then tran-
shipped. Now japan has the grain trade in its own
hands. In every move of the game commercially in the
East, Japan holds the w'inning hand, and the American
trusts, which have very large interests at slake, are being-
outwitted.
Russell agrees with quite a number of people
that America is not ready for war, and
takes a gloomy view of things. Still, though
I don’t wish Uncle Sam any harm, I guess lie’s
about 111,957 times readier than Australia ;
wherefore, if Hell has to be let loose, I hope Sam
has to play before Australia. He’ll win out at
the finish, all right, and the other party to the
disturbance will have to nurse itself long enough
for our kid army to grow big enough to carry a
gun without breaking its back.

Dentil isn’t always the pursuer ; some-
times the man with the scythe is caught against his
will. One of the four men lost with the Mel-
bourne yacht Mavis, in the hurricane of 10 days
ago, had to run the whole length of the long St.
Kilda pier to catch the boat, and even then
had to jump on board as the boat edged out
before the breeze. It is occasionally a fatal dis-
advantage not to be lazy and short of breath.

The cow country of the N.S.W. North
Coast is the place to get a man into extravagant
habits. Old Shorthorn, having made a nice dry
bit, decided on a clearing sale lately, and had the
auctioneer up. Bidding wasn’t as lively as it
should have been. “ Here,” whispered the
auctioneer to Old Shorthorn, “these chaps want
livening up. Go and get them something to
drink.” Old Shorthorn disappeared. Presently
he came back—with a cask of creek water.

THE VISION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A piercing shriek went whistling by my ear,
And struck the wall ; and as I rose,
Startled from sleep, white with a horrid fear,
The poet, in a shocking lack of clothes,
Burst in the room, and swift across it fled,
And sought to find a refuge ’neath my bed.
I dug him out, and asked him to explain
His swift intrusion and his shocking state ;
I said it long had given me grievous pain
That he should drink and smoke and dissipate ;
But ’twas a thing that gave me more than gloom
That he should bring his horrors to my room.
“ Not horrors, sir ! It was a vivid dream
That scared me so that, waking, here I fled ;
Its anguish was intense in the extreme ;
And even now my shock is not quite dead.”
fie paused awhile to dry a fearful tear,
And drank the remnant of my supper beer.
“ Long have I sung my songs of faithful love ;
Long have I mourned —in verse—the love I 10.-. t ;
Long have I wept, in words that many move,
My lonely heart, my early love-dream crossed
By Parting’s shade ; my theme of poetry
Was ever of the dear love lost to me.
“ And, when I dreamed, a lady by my bed
Stood with her arms outstretched, and cried : 'At lust!
Mine, ever' mine!' I, waking, shrieked and fled. . . .”
I laughed at him. “ Why fly ?” I feebly gasped.
“I thought ’twas she!” he groaned. “Lord! how
austere
And fat the love I’ve sung for forty year ! ”

where the nurse (Miss Mary Thompson)
was installed. Miss Thompson had al-
ready been at work with the State
school as her centre, and had given in-
struction to the children. Her pupils
gave exhibitions in bandaging. A little
girl bandaged Lady Dudley for an in-

similar service for Sir T. G. Carmichael. (

“Bro”: The gramophone is giving the
old concertina a run for it in the bush ; and the
bellows-music is iqostly coming in second, when
it doesn’t give up and prill off the track. Even
the mouth-organ hangs on better; you see, when
you’re out riding behind sheep, you can while
away many an hour with the handy “ horgan,”
whereas even a folded concertina can’t be slipped
into a vest pocket. Often the gramophone and
organ meet and “divide the honors.” They did
at a bush darnce I was at in the Yassberra district
lately. The floor was a bit bumpy, but no one
seemed to mind that. Those who preferred the
slow movement stuck to the mouth organ ; the
gramophone was for those who like theirdarncing
fast and furious. “Our own correspondent”
afterwards described it as “ one of the most enjoy-
able functions every held in the district.”
THE ART OF FREEZING.
FRIENDLY ONE: “ Ain’t a nice cough you’re got,

“ Itan ” : The bald-headed > Mount Lind-
say frowns down on some bizarre things from, his
rampart in the Macpherson Range. One hillock,
like the smouldering Mount Wingen, close to
Scone, has been burning since the Oldest Inhabi-
tant can remember. There is an occasional sur-
face subsidence ; but otherwise no indication from
a distance of the living danger underfoot. The
smoulder is probably due ’to a kerosene shale seam
which caught fire while black brother hunted the
prehistoric ’possum. Near by is a cave wherein
the early nigger is said to have picked the
bones of the early pioneer. The beds of
every creek contain lumps of water-worn
coal washed down from the seams which
Crop out in the mountain sides. On a
Boomi flat fragments of opal can be got in almost
every prospect, while the goldfield which once
boomed the countryside thereabouts, is well repre-.
sented in colors in almost every gully where the
prospector gathers up his dishful of dirt. The
rough character of the ranges and the thick tim-
ber and jungle on the plateaus discourage the
working miner, but probably hold for the future
some wealth which may yet stir the wild-cats, and
give them food for a riotous time.
WHEN THE HOBBLE
REACHED THE MULGA.
Mary: “By Gripe, Missus
been put on dress upside-
down, mine tinkit."
“Marloo": I hate not to oblige gentle-
men like “James Pannikin,” who I have gleaned
from his writings, is usually shown to the best
snoring apartment of the outback mansion, so I
furnish him with this certain cure for the mos-
quito worry. Take—
(l) Sufficient coarse wire gauze to cover the mural
orifices of his room, and at the same time admit a supply
of oxygen.
(2) One canary cage.
(3) One bat (winged variety).
(4) One butterfly net.
As the shades of night fall, and James is shown
to the blue room, or the green room, as the case
maiy be, he must close the door, tuck up the
gauze, and liberate his bat from the cag'd. The
bat will then get busy. When “Pannikin”
avvakes he will take the net, re-capture and cage
the destroyer. If James arises before daylight,
that will be his time to be busy.

“Vagabond”: Never found any of the
usual ’skeeter remedies —citronella, oil of cloves,
etc.—good enough to make the brutes miss a beat
of their buzz-saw song or delay their supper a
minute. The best dope I have struck is a
mixture of 1 part oil pennyroyal, 2 parts
castor oil, 3 parts oil pine-tar. A drop be-
hind the ears and on the cheeks is enough to
discourage the ordinary tame variety, though
I won’t guarantee that it will affect the
real death-before-dishonor brand, I don’t be-
lieve anything short of armor plate would
choke off a Hexham grey. In general the
surest thing is thin brown Stockholm tar
rubbed on hands and face. The drawback
is that you can’t always get it, and when
you can get it it gives a man the appearance
of second-hand furniture. When everything
has failed it is some consolation to know
that lemon juice rubbed on the bites will
relieve the irritation almost instantly. Was
once on the track with a mate that the
’skeeters had a blood feud with. They
chewed lumps off him, and bit him up till
his head swelled like a poisoned pup. He
beat them at last by cutting a thing like a
monk’s cowl out of the bottom corner of a
thin sack, with two eyeholes and a slit to
stick his pipe through. He admitted it was
a bit hot, but added that heat wasn’t his
trouble. His only worry about the future
life was whether Hell would be hot enough
to singe the wings off the mosquitoes.
* * * *
“ Hamer ” : The plea of the petitioner in
a recent divorce case, that her husband was
always threatening to commit suicide, reminds me
of a boarding-house I once stayed at. I had no
difficulty in realising that Mr. Kurreed Hash,
who was a faded English cad, depended for his
support on the struggles of Mrs. Kurreed Hash.
He was a sombre individual, and three times
during one morning I heard him ask her bitterly
to lend him sixpence. The last time was. just as
the gong went for, dinner. Mrs. Kurreed Hash
ignored the pleadings and swept into the dining-
room. Mr. Kurreed Hash cried after her, “I’ll
doit! I’ll do it!” and rushed upstairs. Whilst
I was swallowing my soup I was somewhat dis-
turbed by the sound Of a razor being stropped on
the landing, and the voice of Kurreed Hash mut-
tering bitterly anent the hollowness of life and the
need to end it immediately. Mrs. Kurreed Hash
sat unmoved at the head of the table. I
was beginning to take the matter more
easily when the voice of Kurreed Hash cried
“ Good-bye, all ! ” I leapt to my feet as his foot-
steps moved heavily upstairs and a door banged.
“Will you have some more beef?” said Mjs.
Hash attentively. I reseated myself ; but as I
was half-way through my pudding a gurgling yell
came from above and a body fell with a thud.
“ Mr. Kurreed Hash is committing suicide,” said
the landlady calmly, and asked me if I would
, take some cheese. 1 did have cheese, and while I
, was having it the suicide appeared and asked if
' his dinner had been kept for him. I am almost
certain he wasn’t dead.
“Curse o’ Moses”: To the remarks of
“Hamer” (B. 2/3/T1) on the permanence of
Maori characteristics, I shout indignantly
“ Rats ! ” If “ Hamer ” will produce that “abso-
lute Maori ” who was only the great-great-great-
grandchild of a Maori we will inspect him and
pass an opinion; but on the bare assertion we
can only in charity conclude that “ Hamer ” had
earned a fine of ss. when he met the brown person
in question. Every year since it was first given
to the world, Tregear’s Aryan Maori theory has
been getting stronger and stronger support from
the internal evidence of the Maori’s racial habits
in a pakeha environment. I submit that the time
has come when the Maori should be formally de-
clared a white man. In support of my contention,
I produce Mr. Ngata, of the Maoriland Ministry,
and, the Princess Te Rangi Pai, of the crystal
voice. Let “ Hamer,” when he is sober, produce
me one Maori who is a black man, and I’ll match
him with a blacker of pure Caucasian descent, and
even limit my field of selection to Potts’ Point.
“ Will Weafcherit ” : I had no personal
opinion on the mean-cocky question until the
other day. Then, with my usual
presence of mind I wandered into
the Northern Rivers part of
N.S.W., and started in see if
there was any danger of getting a
job at the creamery. There was.
The biggest cow-cocky affair I
struck was offering 6s. and 7s. a
day, which day consisted of as many
hours as it thought fit, six full
days per week, no public holi.
days, not even Christmas Day
unless it happens on Sunday,
and no half-holiday. In time I
mooched round the factories a
bit, and found that nine and a
half hours’ solid graft was con-
sidered a short day, The hand-
some remuneration mentioned is
handed out just when Boss Cocky
thinks fit. I met an instance in
which a man was not paid until
six weeks and four days after his
first money was earned. There is
no union, no Government super-
vision of factories. Men are taken
from outside work on the hottest
day and sent into a chilling room
to work cold-storage, with no time
to' cool off before going in. It
doesn’t matter if they knock under, as if they
are not on the job they get no pay. No, thanks ;

“ Walt K. Harris ” : Of the 11 species of
bandicoots, the most cursed by the farmers along
the coast between Sydney and Brisbane is the
little gingery-grey fellow who works the devil's
own destruction in the sugar and corn fields. Pro-
bably the maize-grower suffers the most from this
burglar, who burrows for the' seed grain ; and
even a single bandicoot makes a considerable gap
before worlung the edge off his appetite. I have
known farmers so molested by the pests that they
have had to keep watch over their recently-
planted fields night after night with dogs till the
crop has passed the danger period. Years ago
poison was introduced into the argument, and the
grain was soaked in solutions of bluestone,
arsenic and other deadly chemicals. It was dis-
covered, however, that these, or gome of them,
affected germination, so their use had to be dis-
continued. The march of Mrs. Cow is driving
“ bandy ” from his haunts, but there is still suffi-
cient of him to jeopardise the cocky’s soul—if he
has one.
“ Silas Snell ” : A couple of wool-buyers,
at present in Melbourne, had a thrilling experi-
ence in the Gippsland wilderness recently. They
went into the primeval woods, armed to the teeth,
and accompanied by a Rooseveltian outfit, to
shoot ’possums, monkey bears, wallaby and other
big game. One afternoon, when patiently stalk-
ing a Jew lizard under the delusion that it was an
adolescent alligator, Swinnerton discovered a ter-
rifying object. The truly awful spectacle was
pointed out to King, and after gazing in awe for a
few trying moments, the pair agreed that it was
either a Tantanoola tiger or a bunyip, and decided
to risk a shot. Swinnerton fired, and the fearful
thing threw off an astonishing bound, and dived
headlong into the thick timber. Then Swin-
nerton and King went back to camp, and told
their stirring tale, which was received with in-
credulity and disrespect. Later in the day the
big-game hunters came upon a paling house in the
wilds, and found a very hairy settler at the door.
They told their story, and asked him if
he was aware of the existence of an uncanny
creature in the adjacent fastnesses. Miles
replied by lumbering to the window and
calling into the house : “ Banner 1 Hatiner !
here’s the bloke what shot yeh.” Dispassionately
he turned to the hunters again. “ Why,.that was
my missus,” he said'cheerfully. “ Since she got a
touch of the sun lars’ summer she has fancies.
Sometimes she sticks feathers in her hair, ’n’
thinks she’s a hangel; other sometimes she rolls
herself in the ’possum rug, ,’n’ lets on t’ be a wom-
bat. Hanner,. come ’n’ see the bloke what shot
yeh.” “I hope she was not really hurt,” said
Swinnerton tremulously. “Oh, on’y a shot or
two —nothin’ t’ speak off,” replied Miles. “ But
it’s had a bad effect on Hanner. She’s,under the
bed, ’n’ nothin’ ’ll convince her she ain’t a wombat
now. Ido wish people wouldn’t shoot at her—Lb
on’y makes her conceited.”

“ Kobbi ” : Rockhampton’s latest election
recalls an early one. A big-boned 6ft. bullock
driver, attending one of the meetings, happened
to plant his boot on the toes of the town’s toniest
rag-person. Bullocky said he was sorry ; but the
prominent rag-person insisted on inquiring, “Do
you know who I am? I’m Mr. Blank, the soft-
goods merchant.” “Glad to know you,” drawled
Bob. “I’m Mr. Mackenzie, the greenhide
engraver.”

“Vigilans” : In West Kimberley (W.A.)
there is a species of land crab which only visits the
coast for the spawning season, and spends the rest
of the year inland. These crabs only travel at night,
when they get over immense distances and sur-
mount every obstacle. Having reached the limit
of their journey, they deposit their eggs in the
sand and then tramp back again. I saw a whole
army of the strange creatures on the wallaby ;
and that weird night our camp was invaded by
thousands of them—long-legged creatures of great
staying power and hideous appearance.

“Marloo:” “W. K. Harris” (B. 23//2TI)
inquires why sharks die when imprisoned by the
silting up of a bar harbor. I reckon the chit f
cause is the stagnation of the water. Anyhow,
when the harbor improvements were being
carried out at Ballina (N.S.W.), a small inlet
known as Shaw’s Bay, was enclosed, thfe northern
wall being built across the entrance ; but, as water
filtered freely through the stones, one Or'more (I’ll
only swear to one) solicitors of the deep lived
more or less happily in the prison for at least two
years.
THE PUBLICAN’S TOPHET.
“W.C.E.” : “Hamer’s” theory (2/3/T1)
that if a half or quarter-caste woman marries a
pure white the first child of the alliance is liable
to revert to the Maori, as a result of the mother
brooding over the Maori blood in her, fails to im-
press me. It is true that the first child is often
pure Maori—to look at. So, often, are the second
and third. But it has nothing to do with pre-natal
brooding on the mother’s part. I haV’e a pure-
bred Yorkshire sow who was mated, either by
accident or devilment, with a Berkshire boar. In
her sixth, seventh and eighth litters (all pure
bred) distinct Berkshire markings were to be seen,
and the litters were useless for anything except
pork. There’s a case on record of a mare that was
first mated with a donkey, and the fifth time she
foaled the young resembled a mule more than a
horse. This only follows out the theory of natural
reversion, and there are hundreds of other cases
on record to make that theory an established fact.
Even “Hamer” will agree that a sow does not
brood over whitt her litter’s going to be.
THE BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They should love their wide spaces and their bush
better.— Artist John Longstajf on Australians.
We may not write like angels, and our grammar may be
crook ;
We may not put our splendid thoughts inside a pretty
book ;
Our heavy hoofs may stumble when we start to race in
rhyme; .
But, still, the bush is old pals with the native all the
time.
When bushmen wrestle dumbly with a slow and anguished
pen,
Words that we cannot utter whirl around inside us
then.
We lenow that, pink and golden, in the early-morning
light,
The bush is—oh, well, boshter ! Yes, we know it is,
orright!
The bush “ good enough.” Clean through the long
Australian day
The bush is good enough to cheer the toiler on his way ;
The dawning, full of music and the early magpie’s mirth ;
The morning, when the breezes blow blue-devils off the
earth ;
The shady hour of spell and smoke, when labor’s load is
light;
The scarlet-splashed, Wild evening sky, with sundown-
glories bright.
Yes, morh and noon and flaming eve, with scrub-scents
in the air—
The bush is it to bushmen, and the True Romance is
there!
The sleeping plains, the broad, brown plains, with
timber-belts between,
The scrub upon the skyline, or the forest grey and green,
Above Us and around us—and the sudden life that leaps
Act >ss the drowsy stillness ; and the Other sort that
cheeps
And chaWls and whirs and hums and clicks and chatters,
night And day—
Here is the mighty bush—kind, coarse, loud, gentle, grim
and gay ! . . .
The bilsh , to which toe native-born must come back, soon
or late ;
The bush is—Well, the bush is — vov’know what the bush
is, mate!

“ Gil Gunnia ” : I’ve discovered the cham-
pion woman grafter, and she’s in; the Narromine
district (N.S.W.). She can hold her own at build-
ing haystacks, and will manipulate the reins of
the harvester and binder team with any cocky,
or wield a scythe with the next man. In her
spare time she helps the old man to split rails and
fence when he gets a contract.

“ Climax ” : A recent par., telling how a
bore near Charleville ceased to flow on the day
the property was sold, recalls an occurrence not
far from that same hamlet. A selector was having
a sub-artesian bore put down 500 ft. deep, on the
“no water no pay ” principle. When about 400 ft.
had been sunk, the contractor sent in the glad
word that the moisture had risen to within 30ft.
of the surface., A joyful copky handed out a
cheque, and celebrated the occasion in a gallon of
beer. Some weeks later he proceeded to put a
windmill on the hole, then found that the bottom
had fallen out of it, or the sides had given way,
or something, wherefore the tube was os dry as a
Wowser, and he was a very mad cocky indeed. I
can vouch for the truth of this, because I had five
drinks ; also, some time afterwards, I had a .con-
fidential yarn with the man who carted the water.
RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.
ATHERISTIC HOUSEHOLDER (annoyed by persistent
pleading of canvasser. of religious publica-
tion): “No, I wont subscribe to your con-
founded illustrated Bible. Take yourself and
your rubbish off the premises! ”
CANVASSER (bursting): “What the d'ye
mean by calling it rubbish. I tell you it's the
best Bible on the market .”
“Pick”: Sheep men west of the N.S.W.
ridges are beginning to tear their hair over the
blowfly trouble. During a peregrination out-
ward last summer I struck many stations where
the lamentations over heavy losses among breed-
ing ewes and hoggets were louder than Fat’s grief
over the land-tax. The pestilence, plague or
plain nark is responsible, too, for thousands of
jumbucks reaching the sheds minus a considerable
portion of their valuable overcoat. Like the
grasshopper anathema and the caterpillar pro-
fanity, this new inducement for boiling language
is due to the wholesale destruction of bird life by
rabbit poison.
TESTING HER VISION.
MRS. FLYNN (whose good man has been locked up for blackening both her eyes): “ Kin I see
Flynn for a minute, Sergeant?”
SEHGEANT: " Sure, I dunno. Kin you see me?”
“Tarboy ”: Concerning the shearing cham-
pionship, “Bromide” remarks (B. 16/3/T1) that
he doesn’t see why Zimmerle should be hailed as
champion when he “ only beat a man who does not
seem to be known too well.” That is, no doubt,
just the sort of thing which was said when the
first championship was played, fought, swum or
chopped for in any part of the world. Up to the
time of the late match, most of the “champion
shearers ” were made in the pubs or
in the columns of the papers which
have been printing accounts of big
tallies for years past. One of the things
shown by the recent match, in which
an acknowledged “gun” met a man
who fancied himself, with excellent
reason, to be a “ gun ” too, was that
the tales of three-hundred-and-over in
one day are the result either of a
very “ wide cut,” or of working on
sheep which are a disgrace to Austra-
lia’s speciality, good merinos. It is
about time for the good name of our
chief industry that such things should
be brought into the blaze of publicity,
and that can only be done by matches
carried out under strict rules, adminis-
tered by competent judges. This was
done in the late match at Too-
woomba; and Zimmerle is as truly
champion, for the time being, as any
other first champion in any line ever
was. There is this to be said, too: for
several weeks Zimmerle advertised in
the Queensland press his willingness
to meet any shearer in the world for
a purse and side wager of £lOO, “Cooper
or Livingstone preferred.” He met with
no response until Maurer put in £lOO.
Surely, if the match was not truly a
championship match, then there is no mean-
ing in the dictionary definition. I have no
brief for Zimmerle, for I know at least five men
who could make matters very warm for him in a
match. Also there are some young men coming
along. I have always thought that the true cham
pion shearer is hot the man who, through a “wide
cut” or bad sheep, puts up an abnormal tally.

“ Yalgun ” : Know the reasons, any of
you, for the early demise of the half-caste aborigi-
nal ? Have not myself seen one reach the old-age
pension period. Have the privations and exposure
which they undoubtedly endure in camp anything
to do with it ? Does the “ white phelier ” in them
cave in under these conditions ? The majority of
them die from pulmonary diseases. Please note
that I’m not referring to well-fed, well-housed
“half-breeds,” but to the chap who “lives nigger.”

“T.J.M.”: Anyone ever seen a tortoise-
shell tomcat? I casually referred to such an
animal at a prayer meeting the other day, and
was greeted with a storm of derision. When the
air cleared, a small, rat-faced man informed me
that such a thing was unknown. Every tortoise-
shell was a she. Didn’t I know that the late
King—name unspecified—had offered £3OO for a
hemale of that color? Being sceptical, I took a
census of the local cats. Sure enough, every tor-
toise a lady. Had I bad luck, or were the males
all too busy to come up for inspection ?
“ Chloe ”: Was in Derby (W.A.) when an
old identity was making himself more troublesome
than usual. He had been through all the stages
of drunkenness —gay, retrospective, philanthro-
pic and maudlin, and at last,, having reached the
suicidal or homicidal, was pestering everyone he
met for a razor, revolver, rifle, or: even rat poison'.
At last “Mad Harry ” gratified the old: man by
taking him aside and giving him a seven-cham-
bered Colt’s, fully charged with blank cartridges.
Only waiting to give sundry eloquent blessings,
and some fatherly warnings to the donor, the
ancient nuisance staggered into an adjoining
barber’s shop, where the usual loungers were
whiling away time. “Look here, boys,” he said,
“ one of you has got to shoot, me,, else I’ll blanky
well begin on you now.” “ Certainly, certainly,”
said the barber, who knew the cartridge joke; and
before the surprised ancient could stir, and amidst
gasps of astonished horror from the onlookers, the
barber took quick aim. There was a loud report, a
strong smell of singed whiskers, and , a suddenly-
sobered drunk racing madly for the mangrove
swamps, followed by the barber discharging the
remaining barrels in quick succession. Late that
evening a dejected citizen with a well-marked
odor of burnt hair stole back to the township,
sought the Salv’ttrmy refuge, and signed the
pledge for a year.

‘‘St.. S-.” : Don’t snakes fascinate birds?
A lecture written by the late Arthur Nicols,
F.G.S., F.R.G.S., F.Z.S., is still being given in
London, to prove that there is no such thing as
snake’s fascination. The “lecturer” shows lan-
tern slides of birds feeding peacefully, and rabbits
playing about, just as the shakes are about to
seize them. Mr, Nicols’s experience, it is an-
nounced, was based on “a residence of four years
in Australia.”
“Cict”: I hold with “Gecko” (B.
9/2/’ll) that you can’t kill the carpet snake—can’t
kill him dead, I mean—by smashing, crushing or
booting in his skull. The safest, simplest and
only certain method of settling him is to amputate
his stomach. Believing his throat to be cut, he
then pitches the seven himself. But let me tell
“ Berkeley ” (B. 9/2/T1) that he is out a long way
when he declares that the floorcloth pattern of
crawler is perfectly harmless. True, his tusks
contain no poison similar to that of our venomous
reptiles; but the bitten cove is fortunate indeed
if, after being chawed by this beauty, he doesn’t
experience much soreness, festering and often
blood-poisoning. Also, his nip hurts like blazes,
even as the gohanna’s.
* * * *
“ Gil Gunnia ” : I haven’t seen the Bem-
boka Valley (“Pick,” B. 2/3/T1), but I’m putting
my little bit on the Cambewarra Mountain view,
on the road from Kangaroo Valley to Nowra
(N.S.W.). At an altitude of 2500 ft. a magnificent
panorama is opened from the summit. The fore-
ground is luxuriant with mountain fern, cabbage-
tree‘palms and creepers innumerable. Below lie
the green foothills dotted with farms ; and, in the
middle distance, Nowra snuggles on the southern
bank of the Shoalhaven, the silver line of river
tracing its way for miles till it is lost within
the mountains. The ocean view gives majesty
to the scene. The coastline from just below
Gerringong can be followed to far south of St.
George’s Head, with Jervis Bay a miniature
pood in the perspective. The Bemboka Valley
may be all right; but this is the Preface to
Paradise.
“Clancy”: Can any Aboriginal gentle-
man tell me the correct appellation, cognomen or
monniker of the birds known in Queensland as
storm-birds, and regarded by bushmen as infal-
lible indicators of heavy rain? About the size of
crows, and attired in sober grey, they make their
appearance before approaching storms and fly
about in a distracted manner, uttering melancholy
cries like State Frights on the approach of demo-
cracy. The bird has the cuckoo-like habit of
laying its eggs in any old nest that is handy, but
gives the preference to crows as foster parents.
Perhaps this custom is accounted for by its meteor-
ogical duties calling it frequently to distant parts
of the country, thus rendering a fixed abode and
family cares out of the question.

“Kim”: Was marooned on King Island
(Bass Strait) recently for three weeks, through
bad weather and other causes, and during that
time I had more rain water in my boots than ever
was in the chain of water-holes at Yassherra.
Incidentally, a new cattle disease has developed
on the island. Locally it is called “coast fever”;
but “ coastie ” stock, when removed to in anl
pasture, rapidly recover. A striking characteris-
tic of the disease is that the hair of the affected
beast lies the wrong way, as if maintained in that
position by an invisible brush. Local diagnosis
ascribes the trouble to the coast feed, which is
different from that inland. Residents are only
rendered immune by an antitoxin, and settlers in
distant parts of the island send or come in every
week to the pub for supplies.
* * * *
“A.H.S.”: “Bash” (B. 9/2/’ll) is cor-
rect as to rabbits and hares assailing transplanted
vegetation in preference to any other. On taking
charge of a school in Northern Vic. theother day,
I shifted some jonquils. Next morning I found
the flowers I had moved bitten to death, while
the rest were unmolested. The tragedy was due,
in my opinion, to the agitated state of the
soil round the newly-moved vegetable. Nothing
attracts bunny so surely as turned earth.
* * * •
“F.C.” : Can anybody tell me of a tree,
shrub, flower or weed that is hostile to flies? I
keep my place as clean as a Dutch frau’s, but my
neighbor, a market-gardener, is an up-to-date
irrigationist, who simply soaks his land with
water and manure. This is all right for him, and
the manure is sufficiently far away and so placed
that it troubles me not at all; also, in spite of his
bad habits, he is a most lovable and energetic
gardener. But his flies are nomads, and I would
dearly love to hear of something that would per-
suade them in another direction. If anybody
does know of any such vegetable, mineral or other
substance that I can plant about my paddock,
will he please yell out loudly, provided he doesn’t
mention something that can only be procured in
the Northern Territory or at the South Pole?
ONLY A BLUFF.
JONES (after hearing the usual tale of woe):
“But, dammit, how on earth do you manage
to live?”
D ERRLIGT: “I ain’t livin’, boss; it's only a bluff.”
“Cict”: Re “Walt Harris’s” par. (B.
23/2/’ll) on the shark’s inability to live in a silted-
up bar harbor. I know ap inlet—the St. George’s
Basin, South Coast (N.S.W.) —which is never
land-locked, being permanently in communica-
tion with the Pacific per a small river; yet even
here I have seen as many as four big sharks
defunct in the one nosegay. I diagnosed the
death as due, in every case, to starvation. The
shark is no light eater. The only food that offers
when he gets bar-bound is the smaller variety of
fish. But these easily escape him by dodging
into shallow water. So he gets weaker and
weaker, and then some day the creeks spill into
the lagoon a quantity of fresh water. Revolted,
he starts on a precipitous bat for the ocean, and
in 13 cases out of 14 finishes high and teetotally
dry on a sand-bank. Which is his dead finish.
MATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He struck first when the talk was ended,
He struck first where we stood alone ;
I gave the lie that was hardest mended ;
What save a blow shall for blows atone?
Mates we were in the shining weather,
Mates when the face of luck was stern ;
Chance is a wind and life a feather,
And the lessons of men are hard to learn.
Soft was the bush with sunshine dappled,
Sweet was the lilt of the robin’s song ;
Blinded with hate we clinched and grappled
With hell-hot blood in our pulses strong.
Wrath in the veins of youth a-quiver,
Backward we reeled on the giddy height;
Fifty feet below us the river
Seethed and foamed into curdling white.
Lust of life in our ears was calling,
Hard we panted with labored breath ;
He or I from the high bank falling
Needs must go to the lurking death.
He or I in the rocks entangled,
He or I in the waters deep ;
Long we strove by our passion strangled
There on the brink of the headlong steep.
Hot words seemed in my throat to rktlVe,
Youth is a strange, volcanic stuff ; '
Mine was the voioe that stayed the battle:
“ D—n it,- man, I have had enough.”
Loud he laughed,'though his nose was bleeding ;
Rueful I blinked with my closing eye ;
Down at our feet the stream unheeding
Still continued to thunder by.
He struck first when the talk was ended,
There by the brink of the angry foam ;
I caved in, and the row was mended,
Mates we were as we journeyed home.

One of Sydney’s best-known sporting press-
men, Arthur Gregory, said good-bye to “the
prizes of the profession ” the other day, in order
to “take block’’ on a new wicket. Gregory has
been the mainstay of the S. M. Herald’s sporting
columns (cricket, football, athletics, golf, swim-
ming, etc.), for some 20 years, as well as being
“ Short Slip ” of the Mail,
and has latterly found the
work too heavy for his
poor health. The firm
recently gave him a
couple of months
leave, which he
spent on the
Richmond
River (N.S.W.)
back country,
beyond Ky-
ogle, where he
has two strap-
ping young-
sters on the
land. But the
change only
made him rest-
less, and now
he goes to join
the youngsters
for good.
S. M. H. staff
met the other
afternoon, and
Editor Heney
presented the
parting scribe
with a gramo-
phone, an ad-
mirable depar-
ture from the
usual run of
travelling bags,
gold-tipped foun-
tain pens and the
like reminders of his
rush along' the Inky
Way. Arthur Gregory, by the way, is a
brother of Dave Gregory, and an uncle of
“Syd,” and was in his younger days con-
sidered to have a big cricket future. He didn’t
follow up the game, though a fortnight ago,
when playing for Press v. Parliament, he smacked
up 170, and helped the scribes to a glorious
victory.
Advertiser Bonython’s eldest son is to
be Acting-Mayor of Adelaide while Cohen is in

hooks the poor inedible little fish he will hurry

The Woman with the Past comes off the
stage sometimes; and lately a Melbourne court
has been hearing something of one of her. She
began to build the Past as the alleged wife of one
Tipper; and there were three little Tippers.
Tipper seems to have faded away or been lost
overboard, and then the lady appeared as Mrs.
Carrodus, the wife of a baker. With him she
lived in peace for many years. During this time
she persuaded herself, and tried to persuade
others, that she had never had any children, and
that Tipper and the three little Tippers were
myths, like the Six Hatters. Carrodus dying,
the lady became Mrs. Moore, assuring Moore
that she was a spinster. Later on she went so far
as to admit that, though she had got married at
the age of 12, they had omitted to register the mar-
riage, wherefore it didn’t count. Afcei- that she
published the information that she was being
hypnotised, and sought in marriage by about a
dozen different men ; and as a result of these
irregularities the eldest Tipper is asking the Law
to declare her will invalid and to hand her pro-
perty to himself and his brothers, and the Law is
considering the matter.
Although Richard Chaffey Baker was a
lawyer and a constitutionalist, he was no stickler
for formal language when he sat in the Senate
chair. Once a Bananaland senator had been
TOMMY
COLD-
WATER
TAYLOR
(M.L.).
affirming, without
fear of contradic-
tion, and declar-
ing unhesitatingly,
and feeling that it
was the duty of
every member,
etc., for several
weary hours. The
Senate sat silent,
sorry and damp,
for it was a very
hot day. But it
became irritated as
train-time ap-
proached, and be-
gan to interject.
President Baker
rose and checked
the interrupters.
“Can’t you see,”
he said, “ that the
hon. senator is
nearing the end ?
If you leave him
alone he’ll finish
in a few minutes.
If you don’t, goodness knows when he’ll finish-
arid then we’ll miss our trains.” The Bananaland
senator, having sense of humor, finished very
promptly.
“ A.” ■ “ I made my marshals out of mud,”
smd Napoleon—meaning that his most trusted
commanders came from the ranks of the common
people. It thrilled me last week to read the frank
and manly remarks of brave Alf Edden, working
coalminer, now N.S.W. Minister of Mines, de-
ploring “ the fact that he had not had too much
education ” —when I remembered having heard
that much of what schooling he did get was re-
ceived by him at night from his affectionate
children, who, unlike their father, had the ines-
timable privilege of being born in a country
blessed with free and compulsory education.
Staniforth Smith’s little party of three,
which lately got into difficulties in Papua, put up
what ought to be one Australian record, anyhow.
They and their chattels were capsized, and their
matches were drenched. But at last they struck
a light—and they nursed it through their wander-
ings for 34 days!
WHAT ELSE COULD IT MEAN?
“I think the noblest study of mankind is
humanity, and everything that is best in one
should be laid at the feet of an all-
embracing”
“Oh! Oh! Mr. Dawkins! This is so sudden!"
Apropos the handsome and welcome bene-
factions to Sydney charities (amounting in all to
£50,000) under the will of the late Mrs. Hannah
Neale, it will be remembered that the deceased’s
husband, Mr. J. T. Neale, who died some years
ago, so distributed his large fortune as to bring
pleasure to a greater number of individuals than
has been afforded by any other testamentary dis-
position locally on record. Mr. Neale, whose
wealth was chiefly derived from his business as a
carcase-butcher in the long ago, in splitting up
his fortune, evidently tried to remember every-
one who had a claim upon him or had ever done
him a good turn. In justice to the couple,
it should be mentioned that, in life, they
were most free and unostentatious in their charity,
and made no use of printer’s ink.
Now that Captain W. R. Randall has paid
Charon a fare, Captain Hugh King is the oldest .
living Murray River navigator. That Scot
landed in Victoria just at the tail-end of
the Crimean War, and after having a go
at the diggings, packed his wife, children
and other possessions on board the 15-ton
Myra at Echuca, and navigated down
stream to’ Milang, a 1200-mile journey.
Presently he built up a big business
on the Darling and Murray, owning such
well-known hookers as the Gem (still the
largest boat on the Murray), Ruby, Jane
Eliza, Corowa and Mannuin. Big stations
prevailed along the rivers in those days,
and the Croziers and Fishers were kings.
A station that carried less than 100,000
sheep was small silver. One of his
little trips extended over 14 months.
He was commissioned to carry a
cargo of timber to a Darling town
pub, but the river gave out at Bourke,
and when he eventually crawled to
the end of his journey he found the
drinkery built and the pump in full
blast. So he got back to Bourke,
started a sawmill, using a paddle-
wheel to supply the motive power, cut
up timber, and supplied the settlers
with sticks wherewith to erect their
shacks. King sold all his boats to the
Gem Navigation Co. last year.
Mr. J. J. Calvert, Clerk of the Parlia-
ments, is the Father of the Civil Service of N. S.
Wales. In 1853 he entered the Colonial Secre-
tary’s office, E. Deas Thomson being then the
Minister, with Wm. Elyard as “ Chief Clerk ” or
Under-Sec. Three years later Calvert became
Clerk of Select Committees, and for 55 years he
has been one thing or the other in Parliament
House. His dissipation has been football ; for
many years he was president of the Rugby Union.
Good Australians feared that Norman
Lindsay’s visit to the grey, dank, foggy, archi-
pelago in the North Sea might quench the sun-
light in his art. But a glance at his work in the
April issue of The Lone Hand shows no trace of
fog. His illustrations and his description of Port
Said, and his moral story of “The Pup that
Played with Fowls” are a humorous joy ; while
his frontispiece, “The Mutineer,” is a’spirited
example of his dramatic power.
When the late J. C. Neild challenged the
late Senator Andy Dawson to show him, anywhere
in his poems, the line, “Eftsoons the nocent water-
spout,” he was bluffing. The line occurs in
“Songs ’Neath the Southern Cross,” and was
quoted in The Bulletin’s review of the classic—
Eftsoons a nocent waterspout would rise.
And link its head
With its weird counterpart that from the skies
Did downward spread.
Poor John Cash Neild was a touchy mili-
tary grandee. One day a Bulletin artist waited
on him in Melbourne with a request for a sitting.
John Cash spluttered and bristled. “ How—how
dare you?” he gasped. “ The fact is,” explained
the artist, “ none of us black-and-white men have
yet done you anything like justice. 1 felt that if
I could get a sitting from you, I ” John struck
an attitude at once. In about lOmin. the thing
was done. The warrior ventured a glanee over
the artist’s shoulder. He uttered a pitiful cry.
“You scamp !” he cried. “You dare to put my
name under that, and I’ll stake you for criminal
libel.” “I won’t put your name under it,” said
the artist at the door. “I won’t need to.” And
he didn’t need to.
Just exactly what strength Miss Ettie A.
Rout, up till recently editor of the Maoriland
Worker, has been to the M.L. Shearers’ Union,
will probably never been known. But it has been
considerable. When secretary Mick Laracy was
conducting the last case for the sheep-barbers
before the Arbitration Court, at Christchurch, the
tall, fair girl, who sat beside him writing rapidly
on slips of paper and passing them to him, was
Ettie Rout, and when Laracy got into the thick of
what the newspapers called “a sharp passage of
arms” with Judge Sim, it was the lady who sup-
plied him with the ammunition. And some of it
was so point blank that it nearly set tire to his
Honah’s horsetail.
Donald Mackay, of Wallendbeen, the
athletic and ever-restless, swore off exploration
for ever when, a year or two ago, he returned
fever-stricken from Papua. But, once more
seized by the wanderlust, he has bought an
auxiliary schooner and gone from Sydney
to New Caledonia, where he will examine
some remote mineral country ere cruising in
the Solomons. Donald, a brother of horse-
poet Kenneth of that ilk, is a man with
ways of his own. For instance, he never wears a
hat except when in town. One of his youthful
freaks was to pay an eminent expert a small for-
tune to tattoo him from neck to heel, the result
being that his concealed cuticle, encircled by a
great blue serpent, forms a most surprising
picture-gallery. It lately excited the admiration
of old “ Dad ” Simpson, a Port Hacking identity,
who happened upon the manly Donald while he
was swimming. “I siy. Mr. Mackay,” pleaded
the ancient; “ don’t go awiy again to New Guinea
and let the niggers cook you and spoil them lovely
drorins. When you peg out do it right here: I
want to ’ave you stuffed.”
John Lemmon, M.L.A., is the new Pan-
jandrum of the Victorian A.N.A. After years
of struggle, he crowded into the State Parlia-
ment as representative for Williamstown in 1904,
and on each re-election he has been returned with
increasing majorities. John is a Labor man by
conviction, training and early association. He
was born in the caretaker’s cottage at the Trades
Hall, Melbourne, and has got the atmosphere of
that Institution into his blood. At present he is a
member of the Trades Hall Council, secretary of
two trade unions, president of the Friendly
Societies’ Association, and, in addition, actively
attends to his Parliamentary job. He has been
of much value to Victorian Laborism, for, besides
his courage and mental alertness, he has the vigor
of a cyclone stirred to extra effort by a tin on
its tail.
IN DISTRESS.
“ For Heaven's sake (hie) swear or (hie) say
something, Maria, so’s I'll know where the
bed ish."
Just retired, after 45 years in the N.S.W.
Railway Workshops, H. B. Howe, manager of
the Eveleigh hive. It was only quite recently
that Howe saw his life’s dream realised—the
building of a locomotive in the State shops.
When it was decided to make the Socialistic
plunge, Howe was sent to America to study locos,
in the making. Having demonstrated that the
Australian worker was quite capable of turning
out first-class engines, and having had the satis-
faction of seeing a State-built engine doing all
that was asked of it, Howe contentedly gave way
to younger men.
THE LEGEND OF LORD INFLUENZA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lord Grey de Ruthyn, Earl of Loudoun, and Lord
Hastings.—To carry the Great Spurs ; and Lord Hastings
further to carry the Second Sword. (There are only two
spurs.)
Duke of Newcastle.—To provide a glove for the King’s
right hand, and to support his Majesty’s right arm while
he is holding the Sceptre.
Clerk of the Crown.—To be allowed to record the pro-
ceedings in the Abbey. Claims to be supplied with five
yards of scarlet cloth, according to ancient usage.
The Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of London.—
That the Mayor attend the King within Westminster
Abbey during the Coronation and bear the Crystal Mace.
—Coronation Claims.
The day was come for the King to be crowned ;
The King was dressed and the Queen was gowned;
A coach and eight
Stood at the gate ;
Afar in the city the crowds did wait;
Packed and jammed,
Bustled and crammed,
The populace stood like a river dammed,
And stared very hard at each other’s back hair,
Top windows and roofs and the things in the air *
While they waited to welcome the Royal pair.
The Abbey was filled with the earls and dukes
And a choice selection of high-born flukes
Of ev’rv degree ;
Each family tree
Was well represented—as all might see ;
And each great nabob
Had some foolish job ;
The Duke of Blue Ruin—a perfect blob—
Bore the monarch’s spare boots in his weak right hand.
While the Marquis of Barmaid—who owned much land—
Held the parrot feed and canary sand.
Lord Boodle of Broke had the garden rake ;
Lord Guzzle a hairbrush of antique make ;
While the hairwash rare
For the Royal hair
Sir Porkpacker Purchase did proudly bear ;
Sir Also de Ran
Had the frying-pan ;
Sir Dicker the boot polish—black and tan ;
While the Lord of the Manor of Fog-in-the-Ditch
Bore the palace coalscuttle and housekeeper’s switch
(Her corsets were held by Sir Skirtdancer Stitch).
Round his Grace of Blue Ruin—who clutched the boots—
Were two or three hundred most noble galoots,
Each holding some thing
While waiting the King ;
Some nice fluffy bishops stood round in a ring
Till the trumpets blew,
When the idle crew
Shook out their new vestments and swiftly threw
Their very best poses, while ushers flew, /
And the cheers of the outdoor thousands grew.
At last through the nobles the Royal pair came,
And the nice fluffy bishops started the game ;
They got the King down,
And brought the crown,
While one of them tied on a trailing gown ;
They did all the things
They do to the kings.
And blessed him with hands all covered with rings \
Till the King—who was stiff—
Remarked with a sniff,
■ Here, which of you dukes has my handkerchif ? ”
Then a terrible scene took place, for lo !
The handkerchief-hearer was not in the show !
No one knew to their shame
His exalted name ;
No one in particular was to blame ;
Then the King on his knees
Gave a terrible sneeze
And ripped out: “My hanky, my lords, if you please ! ’
From the rabble of lords leaped a page, aged nine.
Who thrust his on the ruler, with “’Ere ! takejmine ! ”
Not a moment was there to be lost. The King
In his woeful extremity used the thing,
While each duke and earl
At the cheeky churl
Gibbered with fury and threatened to hurl
Whatever he held
By right of eld ;
But the base-born imp with importance swelled
As the sneezing King, in his pantomime clothes,
Ribboned, and medalled and speckled with bows,
With the sixpenny handkerchief blew' his nose.
At a suitable moment the Marquis of Bosh—
A friend of the King and a foeman of Sosh—
On his bended knee
He says, says he,
“This hurts us like blazes, your Majesty !
To think that a kid
Should do as he did.”
Here the monarch stood up ’neat.h his spiky lid
And angrily muttered “ Enough, my lord f
If from my own servant I cannot afford
To borrow a handkerchief, lend me your sword ! ”
Then his Majesty caught the young whelp by the ear
And tapped with the sword on the pave. “ Kneel here
Hurry up ! ” he roared
And he raised the sword
As he hissed at the Marquis, “ Watch this, my lord ! ”
Then the blade came down
On a shoulder brown,
And the dust flew out of the kneeling clown,
As the monarch yelled—they heard him afar—
“ Get up, you young baron—for such you are !
Rise, Lord Influenza of Castle Catarrh ! ”
Now Lord Influenza of Castle Catarrh
Has a prominent place where the coronets are.
When a king is crowned
He carries around
A hanky of cambric, expensive and sound ;
And Sir Also de Ran,
With his frying-pan,
And Sir Licker with polishes black and tan.
Sir Porkpacker Purchase, Lords Guzzle and Broke
Have all to give place to this excellent bloke,
’Like the Lord of the Manor of Fog-in-the-Ditch
<Who bears the coal-scuttle and housekeeper’s switch)
And the first Corset Bearer, Sir Skirtdancer Stitch.
All stand to one side
And swallow their pride,
While the Lord Influenza takes up his stand
With a haughty air on the King’s right hand ;
For the corsets, coal-scuttles and things they hold
Are not the least use if the King has a cold.'

The N.S.W. Miners’ Accident Relief
Fund was established mainly through the exertions of
four men, then in the State Parliament, but now scat-
tered —Thomas, the present Postmaster-General;
Kdden, now Minister for Mines (N.S.W.) ; Fegan,
who was lately retired after serving for some years
as Chairman of the Fund; and E. W. O’Sullivan,
deceased. The first idea was to apply it to coal-
miners ; Thomas and Cann (now Speaker) had it wid-
ened to take in practically all miners (only those in
very small mines were shut out, and that was simply
owing to the difficulty of administration). The
secret of its success is that every mine employee is
a member of the fund, and that the cost of collecting
the premiums is practically nil, the duty being
thrown on the employer of deducting 44d. per week
from each employee’s wages. The total amount thus
collected is subsidised by the employers and the
State in equal parts. The local administration is in
the hands of committees, which nowadays are paid a
small fee. These people take the miners’ contribu-
tion, pay out as far as it will go, and either draw
on the Central Board for the balance, or if they have
a surplus they remit it to the Central Board. ' There
is always a certain amount in suspense; so in the
following only cash totals are recorded. The actual
receipts and disbursements would at times differ from
these figures by a few pounds:—■
Contributions Claims Cash
and Subsidies. Paid. Balance.

1909 .. 48,271 33,940 241,511
1910 .. 46,076 35,565 259,080
In addition there is on the one side income from in-
terest ; on the other side, there are fees and inci-
dentals. Interest last year amounted to a very handy
£8532; all working expenditure (fees and inci-
dentals) borne by the Fund was covered by £1497.
Certainly the Mines Department provides office ac-
commodation. and pays the secretary, etc. ; but, even
so, the working expenses are amazinglv small. Last
year those charged to the fund amounted to only 24
p.c. of the total income; and the entire outlay would
be covered by 5 p.c. Even very well-managed Indus-
trial life-offices find it very difficult to work for less
than 35 to 40 p.c. of their income; and this Fund
does more than an Industrial office, since it doles out
accident pay.
Originally the widow of a member killed "by acci-
dent got Bs. per week while she remained unmarried,
and each child under 14 got 2s. 6d.; £l2 was also
paid for funeral expenses. Or the guardian of a
motherless child got the Bs.; or the mother or other
dependent got Bs. Where the accident was not fatal,
12s. per week was paid during disablement. In 1905
it was found possible to increase the allowances to
adults by 25 p.c. and to children by 20 p.c. Towards
the end of the next five years there was an agitation
to get further increases; but the actuary reported
adversely. The Board approves this decision: “In
view of the fact that the surplus at the date of ex-
amination was only £27,000, the decision appears
the only safe one.” And The Bulletin says “Hear,
hear.” A glance at the table printed above shows
some interesting movements. It shows, for instance,
that, though the contributions were £11,893 less
last year than in 1908, the claims were £1027 more.
The contributions were practically the same as they
were in 1904 ; but the claims were more than twice
as great. This growth of claims is due to the steadv
accumulation of pensioners. During last year 64
names were added to the list of those permanently
disabled, and only 10 “permanent” beneficiaries died ;
while 43 children were put on the fund, as against 23
who were put off it. These figures not only explain
the growth of the claims, but suggest that they are
likely to keep on growing. Certainly the time will
come when additions to the fund and removals should
balance one another; but the time obviously hasn’t
arrived yet.
The fund is invested entirely in N.S.W. Funded
Stock, most of it carrying 3J p.c. and the balance
3% p.c.

Mostly the amounts written off hitherto have
been in reduction of the premises account; but
the past half-year’s £4OOO has been used to write
down the bank’s holding of British Consols to £BO.
Even if the bank wrote them down to £2O, the in-
come wouldn’t be reduced a penny. Still the proper
thing has been done, for a reserve fund is supposed
to be available in cases of emergency, and it shouldn’t
stand in the accounts at more than the assets would
realise if they had to be sold promptly. The bank
is still in the extraordinary position of having only
three directors, one of whom is managing director,
and of having no auditor. But, while this must pre-
judice its shares as an investment, and ought also
to prejudice it as a repository for the public spare
cash, the name of Barclay stands so high in Tas-
mania, and the bank’s hold on the best local busi-
ness is so firm, that its idiosyncrasies are quite
overlooked. Assuming that the un-audited figures are
sound, the position is very strong in some respects
and fairly strong in others. Here are some details:
Liabilities.
Feb., 1910. Feb., 1911.
Notes and bills .. £61,164 £62,796 Inc. £1,632

The premises account is very small; and when
a bank’s premises account is very small—in propor-
tion, of course, to its business —it is generally pretty
safe to say that it has good internal reserves. One
naturally can’t tell what a bank’s internal reserves
are; they are something which a bank keeps up its
sleeve. But they are really most important at pre-
sent. We have had six rattling good years, when it
has been almost as easy to make big banking profits
as it is to smell something in a tannery. It is just
as certain as anything can be that the pendulum will
swing back, and, when it does, the banks will make
losses; and whether they will nave to show those
losses depends almost entirely upon the amount they
have put up their sleeves during these years of
wonderful plenty and big profits.
The Commercial of Tasmania has put up its divi-
dend to 14 p.c.—the only bank with head-office in
Australia to take risks and go that high. But it is
a much fairer thing for some banks to pay 14 p.c.
than for others to pay 8 p.c. If, for instance, a
bank is modest in its divs. for years, and builds up
big reserves, its 14 p.c. is less deserving of criticism
and threatening than the 8 p.c. of a bank which has
throughout paid away almost all it could scrape to-
gether. This bank’s capital is £175,000: but its
reserves, as the first table shows, are £lat/,783 ; so
that on the basis of total funds, the div. is only about
6 p.c. It is the size of the reserves rather than the
amount of the public money in the business which
permits the co. to pay 14 p.c. The proportion of
public money in the business is, in fact, comparatively
small—under £5 for every £1 of capital and re-
serves. And, though the proportion of the borrowed
money . (deposits, etc.) retained in cash and liquid
assets is not very large, it amounts now to 35 p.c.,
which at any rate is good enough to pass without
throwing a brick at it.

Six years ago this co. took over the business of the
Brisbane Electric Supply Co.; but no accounts were
printed or made public before 1908. The co. works
on the authority of certain orders-in-council, current
till about 1940. In that year the local authorities
interested may take over the whole concern, paying
fair market price for such tangible property as can
be used in the business and which they may acquire;
no goodwill is to be paid for. If the municipalities
don’t buy in 1940 they may do so at the end of the
next 10 years or at the end of any subsequent 10
years. When the present co. took over the business
it paid £35,257 in addition to the value of plant,
mains, etc. This amount was wholly, or almost
wholly, it seems, paid for goodwill; it figures in the
balance-sheet as “purchase account.” If it is all
goodwill, the substantial reserves are £40,038, less
£35,257, or £4781. Moreover, some of the reserves
are to the credit of a renewals, replacement, and con-
tingency account. If the amount is being accumu-
lated against actual depreciation, and if depreciation
is not otherwise provided for, the actual reserves are
less than £4781 ; also the actual profits are less
than the amounts shown in the table above. It
seems, however, that, even if nothing is being writ-
ten off against depreciation, current renewals are
being charged up as working expenses. There may,
nevertheless, be big renewals by-and-bye, which may
have to come out of the reserves.
After making all the foregoing reservations,
which are to the general effect that the true profits
may be less than the table shows, it is still plain
that the co. is doing remarkably well. In 2£ years
£24,432 has been added to the various reserves;
and the whole of the shrinkable assets don’t exceed
£75,000. This is exclusive of goodwill. That item
is being dealt with specifically; a sinking fund is
being accumulated at the rate of £lOOO a year to
wipe it out. This fund is invested on fixed deposit;
but the interest accretions are not added, which robs
it of the true character of a sinking fund. How-
ever, this at least can be said in defence —the
£lOOO a year will of itself replace the goodwill or
paper asset with solid assets by 1940. The cash
position is strong; there are only a few small trade
debts (£1486), while, on the other side, cash and
book debts amount to £15,868. Capital has lately
been increased: 12 months ago it stood at £84,316;
it is now £94,267. The authorised capital is
£100,000; of this £20,000 is in 6 p.c. pref.
shares, £77,500 in ordinaries, and £2500 in
“employees’ shares.” The calls on A he last-
named are evidently paid out of the bonuses. The
new capital latterly got in has been spent mostly
on a new power-station in William-street—on water-
side property which the City Council once threat-
ened to resume, but didn’t —and on extension of
mains, etc.

The dividend for the first half of the year was at
the rate of 5 p.c. p.a.; for the second half, at
the rate of 7p.c. p.a.-—“the directors being of
opinion that the year’s result justifies an increase,”
which it certainly did. The figures move in a mys-
terious way; profits for the past year were more
than double those for 1908-9. The present prosperity
of S. Aus. can’t be altogether responsible, be-
cause 1908-9 was a prosperous 12 months too. Cer-
tainly, Broken Hill, where this co. carries on a
lucrative business, has more money to spend now
than it had then, and feels more like spending it; but
that would hardly explain the long jump. The fact
probably is that, as with most Australian breweries,
this one has outgoings which it doesn’t set down in
black and white. For instance, though Bung and
Co. may win most of their battles with Cold Tea,
the victories cost a heap of money; and it may be
that the recent outlay has been less than usual. But
the expenditure hasn’t stopped and is not likely to-
stop; and that is an item which investors in
brewery shares must take into account. There is
the further probability that Cold Tea will have the
best of. some of the rounds. This has already hap-
pened in S.. Australia, where many a pub has been
closed. It. is certain that the consumption of beer
doesn’t shrink in proportion to the shrinkage in the
number of pubs; but, even if this co.’s beer and
spirit business were just as large as ever it was, the
co. would still have to write off large amounts on ac-
count of the closing of pubs. The law certainly
doesn’t, sweep the building out of existence; but
the building with the beer pump spiked is often not
worth one-fourth the sum the brew'ery co. paid for
the premises when the pump flourished.
The co. came into existence 22 years back, its
principal purchase being the old *E. T. Smith
brewery and business; and it paid the thumping
price one w-ould expect to be paid for properties—
pub and other—in the boom years 18S8-9. More-
over, there was a large goodwill item. Some good-
will still remains in the accounts; but as it is
lumped with other items, only the insider knows
what it is or whether any of it is being written off.
There certainly is no visible sign of any writing off.
The present capital of the co. is £250,000: 50,000
shares are fully paid to £2 and 150,000 shares are
paid to £l. Twelve months ago the £2 shares were
quoted at 245. and the £1 shares at Bs. 6d. That
suggested not only a large amount either of goodwill
or of over-valuation, but also a poor opinion of the
future: for the only justification for quoting £1
shares at Bs. was the fear that the 5 p.c. div. could
not be maintained. Evidently S. Aus. now takes a
less gloomv view of the outlook, because the £1
shares have moved up to 13s. Still the published
accounts give one practically no idea worth having.
The total assets are £561,069 (book value), and no
less than £487,997 is in one mixed heap—" Freehold
and leasehold properties, machinery, plant, rolling
stock, goodwill, etc.” Owing to this lumping habit
the investor cannot tell how much beer there is in
the pot and how much froth, and therefore how
much the shares are really worth on the basis of
assets. And the profits are so extraordinarily erratic
that no estimate of the value of the shares can be
arrived at on that basis either. For the man who
isn’t behind the scenes, the thing is as much a
gamble almost as the Bullfinch. And from the in-
vestor’s point of view the situation is all the more
dangerous because there are mortgage debentures of
£200,000, which replaced the original mortgage of
£150,000 carried by the over-weighted co. on its
flotation.

Some of the figures in the last line are as near
as this paper can get them by doing a little
guessing. Shareholders are entitled to a cash bonus
of 2s. 3d. in the £ on their purchases for the half-
year ; but there are always a certain number of
coupons lost or unpresented. In the foregoing it is
guessed that the total will be £200; for the pre-
vious half-year it was £lB3, which, however, was
less than usual. The paid capital is £13,884 ; the
10 p.c. dividend, therefore, amounts *o £694, and
the bonus to £10,042. The accounts show what a
big business can be done on a small capital, pro-
vided the concern has cash customers. In the past
12 months the cash receipts were £266,520 —on a
paid capital, as mentioned just now, of £13,884,
Certainly the co. has also nowadays pretty big re-
serves of undivided profits. But almost all the capi-
tal and reserves are represented by stock. The latter
item on January 31 stood at £42,647. Thus the co.
has an annual turnover equal to nearly six times its
capital and reserves. Doing a cash business it can
also pay cash; it consequently collected £1441 in
discounts last half-year—ergnigh to pay 6 p.c. p.a.
on capital and reserves, or 20 p.c. on capital alone.
That’s what cash trading means. It is a most un-
fortunate thing that the Civil Service Stores, though
probably not more than a third of the shareholders
are Civil servants, cater scarcely at all for the
people who can least afford to pay through the
nose for their supplies. Certainly there are a few
working-men co-op. societies, but very few. Wages-
men don’t know what they are missing. The organisa
tion of this thing must come from the trades unions.
It is not enough for them to see that the workmen
get fair wages; it is equally important for them to
see that they get fair value. This society’s progress
in some respects is further shown hereunder:—

In the last half of 1902 the total sales amount-
ed to £13,289. Last half-year they were £19,766.
They ought to have been £197,660 "if the co-opera-
tive idea had as good a grip of the Northerner—
and especially of the Northern wages-man—as it
should have. However, though it isn’t big, this
concern seems to be quite sound. , The only thing to
be complained of is the size of; the book . debts —
£3122. That represents about two-thirds of the
capital. If the people who are in this concern are
really co-operators, and anxious for its success, they
will give it a better, chance by paying cash. If
they did that, the co. would no doubt be able to buy
better, and it would certainly be able to increase
its stock by at least one-third.

This co. was formed in 1907 to take over the time-
payment business of R. H. Gordon and G. E. Wise;
but the public didn’t become interested until a
couple of years later. The eo. sells its own furni-
ture, etc., mostly on the usual hire-contract basis;
but it also carries on a cash-order business. Appar-
ently the co. will finance the right person—or the
person it thinks right—to buy almost anything.
Naturally at a time like the present it can get
heaps of customers; for the more most people have
the more they think they would like. Also Brown is
doing well, and does the thing handsomely; and
Jones, though he isn’t doing quite as well, thinks he
will be doing as well presently, and meantime he
might as well seem to be doing as well as Brown.
In dull times the average man, takes a gloomy view
of the situation ; in prosperous times the future is
all pink, so besides spending more he is prepared to
go deeper into debt. In June, 1909, this co. had
£41,391 of sundry debts on its books; now—lB
months later —it has £68,402. Meantime, “pro-
perty, stock, fittings and goodwill” have sprung from
£27,206 to £73,780. This latter increase, how-
ever, is due chiefly to the purchase of the Cooper
property, known as AVaterloo Chambers, where
the co. proposes to presently establish itself. The
price isn’t mentioned; but the Cooper estate has a
mortgage of £31,950. Presumably, to help pav for
the new premises the co. is issuing 20,000 6 nc
cumulative pref. shares; and it has taken power to
ther 3 J °> ooo ordinaries. There were alreadv
£50,000 pound shares fully paid and 10,000 paid
December 31, besides the mortgage of
£31,950, the co. owed £28,644. The profits shown
so far have been magnificent; they include, of course,
additions to the reserve funds—and some of these
additions are unexplained. The accounts can be dis-
sected this way;—

June, 1910 .. .. 5585 .. 1448
Dec., 1910 .. .. 7339 .. 3261
Where those unexplained additions come from, or
what they are a reserve against, this paper doesn’t
know. They may be a provision against bad debts
arising out of uncompleted transactions; and, if so
the chances are that, if the tide of prosperity turned’
a large part of them would be called for. The busi-
ness appears to be a pretty risky one; on the other
hand, given very good management, the profits are
likely to be very fine. Almost everything depends on
the management. At the same time, when the co
lias a large swag of capital invested in city property
it will find it hard work to keep up the old per-
centage of profit. It is one thing to make 15 p.c. on
£50,000 of capital invested wholly in a time-pav-
ment business; it is quite another thing to make
15 p.c. on £lOO,OOO, of which £50,000 is invested
in city freehold.

Profits are stated gross, without any deduction for
depreciation. The amounts shown as written off
have been actually spent in repairs, renewals, and
reconstruction. On top of that it is quite probable
that there has been some general wear and tear. In
fact, the big “written-off” figures for the past half-
year show that plainly enough; for the expense of
special repairs, or reconstruction, which should have
been spread over several terms, has been thrown
wholly on to one term. llow much of this special
renewal work lies ahead, it is, of course, impossible
to say. But, viewing the small amount laid by, it
seems pretty certain that the dividend has been
barely earned if provision is made for special re-
newals. This latter remark does not apply in par-
ticular to the past half-year. It applies generally to
ail recent terms.

A cable from London reports the death
of Mr. Arthur Flower, of the Union Bank of Aus
tralia. He had been a director for 32 years, and
chairman for five years. The Flowers have been con-
nected with the bank since its foundation in 1837.
In that year the bank came to Sydney, and opened
on the north-east corner of King and George streets.
The first directors were Ranulph Dacre, Thomas
Gore, Philip Flower and S. K. Salting; the manager
was James Sea, who had left the service of the
Bank of Australasia to take-the position. Three at
least of the directors were members of the one firm.
In 1840 the Union removed to the corner of Hunter
and Pitt streets, adjoining the stores of Flower,
Salting and Co. These stores the Union Bank
bought, and afterwards erected up-to-date premises
on the block. Apropos the fine collection of pictures
bequeathed to the nation by the late Mr. Salting
(who drew £30,000 a year from New South Wales!
is now open to the public at South Kensington

of great importance is happening—Australian oil

The Y Water Hole tin mine, Emmaville
(N.S.W.), made a profit of £3300 for 12 months
ending January 31. Since then, this co., which has
40,000 shares issued, has been doing well, and has
cleaned up 40,000 tons of black tin. A dividend is
pushing its nose over the horizon. The property is
owned mostly in Melbourne, and manager Moline
has been doing first-class work for his bosses.

New Hillgrove Prop. (N.S.W.) is to be

Mt. Copeland (N.S.W.), with an experi-
enced Victorian mining man as manager, is expected
to do things shortly. Still some of the yarns about
the show are high-flown. For instance, the battery
of 20 head is expected to crush 3000 tons per
month; No. 2 tunnel is in 317 ft., and stone is
being broken from No. 1 tunnel. As some thou-
sands have been spent on equipment, the result of
the first crushing will be watched anxiously.

Though the Elmore flotation process is
getting some hard knocks in Australia, it seems to
be holding its end up in Europe, especially in con-
nection with the concentration of low-grade copper
ores. A semi-official note say's; “The 500-ton El-
more vacuum plant at Sulitelma, Sweden, after over
two years’ continuous night-and-day work, is again
being enlarged up to about 900-1000 tons per 24
hours, thus constituting the largest flotation plant
in the world for treatment of copper ores. The plant
operates at minimum working costs, consuming in
each ton of ore treated only 2.71 b. of the cheapest
kind of common fuel oil obtainable, and no acid.
The Elmore process is still finding wide application ;
plants of an aggregate capacity of about 1,000,000
tons per annum have now been supplied for the
treatment of ores of antimony, arsenic, copper,
copper-gold, lead, molybdenum, tin (complex), zinc,
and zinc-lead.”

Golden Horseshoe (W.A. ) announces the
entire possession of the southern portion of Boulder’s
main lode and backbone at 2800 ft. This makes
things better for liorseshoe, but takes away a fair-
sized hunk of Boulder’s speculative value in deeper
ground. Nevertheless, the ore body alluded to has
twisted and turned so often from the surface down
to 2800 ft. that a hundred or two feet further down
may find it again elbowing its way across the border
into the Boulder. So far the bore which has just
made the discovery mentioned above, shows the lode
to be at least 16ft. wide and to average 22dwt.
Unfortunately it w’ill take some years to reach this
good ore, and much may happen to the co. in the
interim. Moreover, the fact that £lOO,OOO worth
of debentures, with interest on same, have to be re-
deemed or arranged for before shareholders can get
another stiver in dividends, does not help to brighten
the outlook.

Some marvellous progress reports come
through from Bullfinch, involving great literary
labors on the field and much profanity at the Board
meetings where the screeds are read. As witness:
“Have timbered ground opened up, as its nature is of
a kind that requires timber.” And why not: “Am
starting to sink shaft, as I find that locally a hole or
two on a mine is the invariable rule.” But this
letter from, a syndicate representative is the limit:
“Why are you always asking me for accounts of how
I spend money? You leave me alone and send the
money, and I’ll be a great suclccess. I have arranged
well with people here —good workers and top
schemers, and when we get a show it will boom.
You leave me alone and send money, and we’ll be a
great suckcess. But if you don’t leave me alone we
won’t have a boom and we won’t be a great suck-
cess. Now you know.” The Bulletin wonders
what a “top schemer” actually is, though it has a
fair idea.
* # * *
Even the worm will turn —as witness
these extracts:- —-West Australian (17/3/’ll):
“Public opinion is strongly opposed to what is re-
garded as picking the eyes out of the Bullfinch in
order to provide milling returns of a sensatibnal
nature. .. . The working policy insisted on by
the Board is bitterly condemned.” Perth Sunday
Times (19/3/T1): “The mine is.forced into the posi-
tion of a producer of rich ore only at the very time
that exploration and development should be the
object of the management.” Boulder Star: “There
seems to be a lot of rising and pot-boiling in progress,
but no further sinking on the rich ore deposit.
Why?” Another goldfields .paper: “Doolette and
party put the value of the probable ore in sight
down at £500,000, whereas Gerard Williams says
that only one-half of the wealth can be reckoned
on. Are these two estimates pure guesswork, or are
thev based on work done? If the latter, on what
work done?”

“Oof Bird”: Re views of . “R. 8.” (B.
5/l/’ll). Isn’t it up to this party or some of the
other demented pptimists who blowed about the
Bull Ant a month or two ago to show where its
value comes in? Where is the “surrounding schist
that carries gold,”, and what has become of the
2140 z. hornblendic rock which, according to “R. 8.,”
caused Grut to turn the Ant up again with great
velocity after previously turning it down ? When
Bill Clark (Lionel Robinson’s partner) got within
sniffing distance of the wild cat, he had to hurry
from the spot to avoid heart failure or something,
and everybody else who turns it over gets the same
feelings Perhaps “R. 8.” wouldn’t mind sending
along an answer to the aforesaid questions, and also
tack on a suggestion as to best ways and means of
humoring the crowd of disgusted shareholders who,
when the last mail left Perth, were clamoring for a
return of subscription and allotment money, and
demanding the prosecution of those who wrote and
circulated exaggerated and misleading reports as to
the value of the property. ,

and as current profits fall several thousand pounds
short of this amount, the deficiency has to be made
up out of the fast-dwindling reserve fund. The end
of this simple plan is, however, in sight; so
shareholders had better prepare for the inevitable.
Just before the last mail left London, the
Great Boulder Co. was '.busy denying an indus-
triously-circulated report that it was about to chip
a bit off both output and dividends. All the same,
unless developments on the level confirm the bore-
hole results recently obtained at 2800 ft., there will
have to be a reduction.

Bullrush Gold Estates tried to fluke labor-
exemption of 11 leases the other day, but Warden
Finnerty wasn’t having any. A plan of the work
done and proposed to be done on the co. s 260 acres
showed a prospecting shaft down 12ft. and thousands
of feet of costeening. When sufficient inducement
was offered, the manager stated the co. would sink.
Finnerty said the regulations were dead against
granting applications like this, and abrupty refused
it. „
* * * *
In justifying the acquisition of the El Re-
fugio Mines, Mexico, Chairman Landau, of the
Associated Northern, warned shareholders not to run
away with the idea that the co. had an El Dorado
in the new venture. He reckoned, however, that the
property was a good ’un and would ultimately pay
dividends. He ; read the usual favorable cable from
the resident mining engineer, and added that share-
holders would soon receive a circular setting forth
the most recent developments. The El Refugio,
whose history runs back to the Spanish conquest,
lies well above the snow, line on the side of gome
Sierra. The reef, so the yarn goes, has a width in
places of 30ft., and contains both gold and silver.
Probably, like some other far-off foreign ventures
which the Boards of Westralian gold cos. have gone
' into, it won’t glitter so much when the shareholders
try to get the metal. And that’s when the ’‘insider”
has a chance to score by getting out on early in-
formation.
* * * *
Gympie (Q.) thinks it is about time to
interest outsiders in the best of its neglected pro-
perties. The United 7 and 8 Monkland had been
marked down for attention 12 months ago; but it
was thought that it would be better to let the No. 2
’ Soutli Great Eastern first have a change u> show what
it could do. That property h»v-; ilg put itself firmly
back on to the dividend nst, the Monkland and
Inglewood Deep Sink’,,* G. M. Co. is on the market.
This takes u> the old Nos. 7 and 8. the top
slates in cnis property over £300,000 was won,
and the idea now is to go to the third oed of slates
and work the ground corresponding to that in which
the neighboring Scottish Gympie and the No. 2 are
working. The No. 2 has paid £540,000 in divs.,
and the Scottish Gympie—the best English-owned
mine in Queensland— is now on to payable stone
40ft. wide. What this co., a, steady dividend-paver,
thinks of the prospects can be judged by the fact
that it has put a quarter of a million into plant on
its leases. The Monkland and Inglewood promoters
reckon on picking up the gold stone in 600 ft. more
sinking; and the general manager of the- big Scot-
tish Gympie says of the chances: “The prospect is
a genuine one, and the Inglewood reef well worth
working, and if worked systematically and economi-
cally should pay.” The venture looks thoroughly
honest and the chances much above the average,
while the proposed capitalisation ( £20,000 in 6s.
shares) is strictly moderate.
No. 2 S. Gt. Eastern will continue to
2000 ft., as soon as the crosscut at 1750 ft. is in a few
feet. The Power reef, worked at the 1100 ft. and
1230 ft. levels, has provided several small dividends.
The recent crushing of 885 tons gave £3273. South
Glanmire and Monkland are also hopeful of striking
the Power reef, though the favorable black slate was
not cut in the crosscut at the 990 ft. level. It may
still be picked up overhead, though. The circum-
stance that gives the Monkland end of the field its
paramount interest nowadays is the deep development
of the Inglewood reef by the Scottish Gympie. This
co. produced £93,059 last year, and paid £20,625
in dividends, from stone averaging between sdwt.
and 6dwt. fine gold per ton —a very fine performance.
* * * *
Etheridge (Q.) has had two welcome lifts
lately. The Acorn Go. has been floated in 100,000
half-crown shares, of which 40,000 are paid-ups. Of
these, 23,000, with £2OOO in cash, go to the
vendors, who hand over the Victory Block, Perse-
verance, Waratah and Lucknow mines. A lease has
, been taken up embodying all of these, adjoining the
Oaks Rush ground. The other lift came with the
successful launching of the Etheridge Gold Mines,
Ltd., which will mother the Big Reef, Nil Desper-
andum, Havelock and Queenslander mines under one
management. The reduction works are to be built
near the Havelock, where crushing and concentrat-
ing will be carried on. Chillagoe smelters will then
deal with the concentrates.
1 * * * *
The Old Man reef in the Etheridge (Q.)
is in the hands of a Brisbane syndicate, with the ex-
Croydon warrior, John Plumper Hoolan, at the helm.
Some payable returns were obtained in the early days,
and it is only about nine years ago that work was
suspended. Like most Etheridge mines, the .Old Man
is heavily mineralised, and with the Chillagoe Co.’s
sampling and smelting works handy, there should be
a better chance of recovering metal values.
■» * * *
Apropos Croydon’s listlessness, the Queens-
land Under-Sec. for Mines mentions the Esmeralda.
He speaks of “a 9ft. reef, worth Bs. to £1 a ton;
equipped with a 12;stamp mill and a 40-ton cyanide
plant.” The results “from one short level” were
disappointing, and the co. bolted.

Bananaland has now 37 active collieries,
which last year produced 871,166 tons, or 114,589
tons more , than in 1909. The biggest developments
of recent years have been in the Central district.
Blair Athol (near Clermont) produced 34,707 tons,
while the Bluff mustered 14,401 tons, a slight de-
crease on the previous year. The Dawson River
areas, to which a i railway from Mount Morgan is
creeping very slowly, has had the severest recent
cross-examination. In all, 37 bore |holes,,- totalling
9000 ft., have been put in, and four, or five million
tons of coal have been thereby proved. There may
be much more; but the owners are ndw prepared to
swear to that lot. :
In Bananaland, last year, the gold output
was the lowest since 1888, and only , two-thirds of
the State’s best. The best happened in 1900.
* * * *
Cumberland P.C., Charters Towers, has
crushed 263 tons for gold and concentrates, worth
£2930. Early in the month some of the concen-
trates were sold for £56 4s. per ton, which shows
how heavily mineralised the stone is. There is a
fair block of ground 6vey.No. 3 level, which is 230 ft.
from the surface. It was in 1908 that J. Simpson
commenced mining in this property on a poor-looking
outcrop; but prospects rapidly improved below the
50ft. level. The average yield from 3101 tons of
stone raised in three years has been £ 6 6s. 3d. per
ton. Last year’s lot was 2117 tons for £14,146.
Two cos. have taken- up ground east and west of the
Cumberland P.C. ; one of them, the Cumberland and
Golden Ant, has had a small trial crushinsr. All
these properties are held almost wholly by Charters
Towers people.
* • * *
East Mexican, Charters Towers, after
many years of hard work, is at last able to declare
its maiden dividend. The sixpence per share will
cost £3075; so, unless the drustrings get larger or
richer, the Mexican will not be able to burst out
into frequent sixpennies. The return from the last
240 tons was £1963. Stopes over No. 6 and No. 5
levels carry only about 18in. of good stone ; which
means that the mine will have to be developed on a
more extensive scale to give a large tonnage. Just
at present the management is anxious to complete
the shaft to the base level, which will faeilitare
other work. An interesting bit of prospecting is
the crosscut, at the 760 ft. level, in search of the
hanging-wall reef that has given such good returns
to the New Brilliant Freehold.
* * • *
One of the centres of moderate activity in
the otherwise dull field of Ravenswood (Q.) is the
Kirk diggings, on the Kirk River. There the
Breitkreuz mines (the Three Sisters, and —name of
names- —the Three Sisters Extended) earn a bit
moye than a crust. The Elongated Girls are now
down 1050 ft. where a lode about 2ft. wide, and of
fine quality, is being made love to. Last year the
Three Sisters gave 3602 tons for 12,437 sovereigns.
* * * *
Great, Fitzroy (.Q.) is experimenting with
cheap eucalyptus oil in concentrating its low-grade
ore by the flotation process. Last yea*, this mine
produced £128,184 worth of metals, including
£34,492 for gold, from the smelting of 59,365 tons
of ore. The furnaces turned out 5114 tons matte,
containing 1502 tons copper, 81240 z. gold, and
36,9960 z. silver. Taking metals at full market
rates, the average extraction pans out £2 3s. 9d.
■ per ton —a good-looking average, but terribly de-
ceptive. Hence, after various deductions were made,
for freight, treatment and realisation, Great Fitzroy
is left to worry over a loss instead of a profit.
* * * *
Hampden, Cloncurry, should begin treat-
ment operations about the end of April. It is rum-
ored that the plant is to have only six or eight
weeks’ run, and will then close down until the rail-
way from the Duchess (some 40 miles or so) is con-
structed. During that time portions of the plant
will also be duplicated. If this is so it is difficult
to see where the sense of u comes in. For the pur-
pose of increasing the capacity of the plant there
can be no necessity whatever for closing, as exten-
sions could be effected during the working of the
present unit. With regard to the railway, given
every favorable advantage it will take six months
at least to construct, and, with unfavorable con-
ditions, longer.
* * * *
St. Mungo, which gouges out some very
rich ore from a small copper vein in the Cloncurry
district, has hatched another sixpenny dividend—
its third, on 10,000 shares. The co. was the first at
Cloncurry to pay a dividend.
* * * *
Gilmore (Q,) reached its ninth half-yearly
meeting at Irvinebanlc the other day with £1968
to the good. Last half-lap it was on the wrong side
by £l4BO. The upper workings of the Dolly Gray
came to the rescue, and besides providing the surplus
also supplied the dollars to sink the last 100 ft. of
the straight shaft. The latter isn’t encouraging,
the ore body becoming poorer and more disturbed
the deeper it got. The co. is now looking anxiously
towards the Midas mine.
* * * *
‘Kobbi”: The big stack at Mount Morgan
has to be ribboned with steel bands to keep body
and soul together; otherwise a crash might have
disturbed the dividends. The stack is 250 ft. high.
To settle 3897% arguments, will some Wild Cat-ite
say if there’s a higher mining stack in Australia?
* * * *
Golden Horn, Mt. Leyshon (Q.), crushed
1525 tons for 118 oz. Expenses will take over
2dwt.: so the Horn will have to spill something
better if it is to pay.
* * * *
Sebastopol Plateau No. 1, Ballarat, rears
its head again in solitary grandeur on the old >
famous line of reef. The chief cause of this is that
the co.’s scrip has got into what is described as
“right hands.” In actual results this may mean
tons or a thimbleful. If call-paying stickers have
the shares, nothing could be better. If it means
that the “right hands” are “right” from the point
of view of a Stock Exchange jig, then the term is a
misnomer. Anyway, it is always nice to see old
friends, even though their garb be a bit patchy.
Plateau No. 1 is at present trying the shallow
ground, and there is some steady prospecting in
progress. The 288 ft. workings haven’t realised a
bonanza, and 378 ft. is blessed mostly with “indi-
cations,” though now and again “stone in breaking
shows gold.”
“H. *P. Bittner* : The facts re the applica-
tion for the forfeiture of Peacock’s Maude and
Homeward Bound (B. 2/3/’ll) are as follows: An
application for the forfeiture was lodged in June
last. An inquiry was held before the Warden, but
his decision being unfavorable to the applicant for
forfeiture, .the latter appealed to the Minister. The ,
Minister on December 6 decided “to give the co.
six weeks within which to comply with labor cove-
nants ; failing compliance, the leases would be for-
feited, and leases granted to the applicant.” The co.
professed to accept the verdict of the Minister, by
employing the specified number of men; but it im-
mediately applied to the Minister for the consolida-
tion of the leases (68 acres) and the excision there- •
from of about 20 acres along the line of reef, pro-
posing to abandon the balance of the ground, which,
under the circumstances, would be of little use for
any practical purposes of mining. This the Min-
ister has granted, in spite of protests from the
applicant-for-forfeiture, who was prepared to take
over the whole area and comply with the labor
covenants. From the foregoing it would appear
that it was not Peter Mcßride who put hi» foot
down and compelled the co. to work tue mine, but
it was Peacock’s boot that persuaded Peter to dis-
regard his own recent decision. The making of a
call by the co. was merely pretence.
* * * *
Curiosity lias been awakened over the
statement that the resurrection of Blakeville (Vic.)
is in the hands of a party of Ballarat investors.
Blakeville has alongside it a drear spot called Whisky
Gully, which had, as a draw, the Great Britain mine.
When that co. went the way of all flesh, after yield-
ing moderately, the show was recast into the North
Red, White and Blue. This didn’t mend affairs, and
for years the claim has been a one-man pocket-
borough. Now the mine is re-christened the North
Briton. The lode is “of considerable width” and
the shoot of gold of “exceptional length.” These
attributes entitle the North Briton to come op the
platform as a 6dwt. turn, backed by a 30,000 share
capital and £lOOO of hard cash. We can hope for
the best for Blakeville; but as to faith—well, let
the battery talk.
* * * *
Hercules (TasV), which, owing to troubles
with the smelters, sent away nothing but zinc ore
last half-year, barely made ends meet; and, after
writing off £991 to cover depreciation, the profit
and loss balance was reduced 'from £22,883 to
£22,512. A new agreement has, however, been
made with the Tasmanian Smelting Co., and the
shipment of lead sulphides will be resumed. The
co. still has liquid assets of over £lO,OOO, including
£8706 in cash.

Waihi Grand Junction (M.L.) cut a new
reef lately 33ft. in width; Oft. of it assayed 475.,
but the rest was poor. Since then the body has been
driven on both ways, and the full width of the drives
has been in good grade sulphide ore. At one point,
where the drive was widened to 10ft., the working
was all good ore. A second crosscut from the Martha
is to be continued to pick it up 200 ft. further east,
if it is still alive in tha( direction.
* * * *
Maoriland shareholders in the Waihi,
particularly the Southerners, are, in their soreness,
shaking things up with a view to getting a change
in the directorate. The Wellington committee is
rounding up proxies to put in Topham and A. E. G.
Rhodes, of Christchdrch, and bump out some of the
old Board. Meantime, houses can be bought cheap
in Waihi and Waikine.

A Christchurch (M.L.) syndicate has
lately taken up scheelite mining in the hills of
North Otago, near the old Macrae’s alluvial; field. A
little of the , metal has been got in Otago for years
past, but not enough to swell anybody’s head.
The dhp.teneh arrests have jgiven quite a
number p{ people in the West cold shivers. .Under
the clause' which gave power to gaol Dyason, Boriwick
and Greenway, the police can run in anyone who
does anything to .prejudice the market for a mining
share. In this particular case it happens that, be-
fore, yoting Green Way dropped in his wrecking bomb,
various seasoned mining men had visited the show,
and|. tumbled over themselves in their eagerness to
get back to' the Cross and “speck” shares. Further,
one ’fields paper called the reef “a portmanteau
lode,” Naturally these people don’t feel comfort-
able. The whole question is: Were the statements
they made false? And thereupon arises the ques-
tion: Who is to decide as to the falsity or other-
wise of a report made about a mine? The situation
is interesting. If things pan out as some people fear,
there will scarcely be a speculator or a newspaper
man left by the time the issue of warrants has
ceased.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in. Australia. Bushings of
flexible rollers may be applied to lo>, a e pulleys or

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repaii
than Gyratory and" other crushers. This machine is
of the well-known Blake type, but has some ad-
ditional improvements which have justified in prac-
tice all the claims advanced by the patentee. Inc
work of crushing is done on the down-stroke of the
pitman instead of the up-stroke; there is no strain
on the pitman cap; two large side rods resist the
thrust of the toggles, and enable the jaws to be
regulated within a large range; the back toggle is
so made as to resist all legitimate strains of crush
ing, but will shear under exceptional conditions .and
save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings
are self-lubricating; the jaws are convex and con-
cave and with the cheek plates are made ,of steel
and are reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have installed a great
number y of these machines, and hold the sole manu-
facturing rights for the Commonwealth.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
.. Stonkt, March 27, 1911.
Mr Drar Arini,—
A taxi-cab, protected by the Parramatta flag,
«*® med r °und the pedestrian traffic, top of
William-street, on Saturday afternoon. It was
leceived by the Rushcutters Bay naval base.
Commander and Mrs. Brownlow performed the
melancholy function of extending the hand of
welcome to scores of persons who wore their best
or worst expressions, according to their up-
bringing. An air of gloomy resentment usually
marks the nervous man who is forced, by the in-
scrutable workings of social engineers, to hurl his
palm and presence into an official wall of icy
reserve. Mr. Murnin, who lieutenants in our local
naval force, broke the reception shock, by crossing
an aching void of grass to meet the frock parade,
this was mild and indeterminate. Society was,
presumably, either getting into trouble at the
buckjumping jiu-jitsu carnival or scratching its
names on the face of Percy Hunter’s leading
tourist hotels. A first-class freeze on board H.M.S.
Powerful would have collected all the good gowns
and bad manners of the Potts’ Point elect. But
the elect carefully stayed away from anything so
indigenous as a local flag-flap.'
Two boy scouts, armed to the windpipes with
black kerchiefs, stormed the flagstaff platform
with the carved box which hid the labors of
patriotic Parramatta. Mrs. Mayoress John
Waugh offered a determined front to any
attempt to exclude the Parramatta River from
its share of public applause. The Commander
of the Destroyer, which has taken its name
from the river, bright and sea-breezy in
manner, defied any male person present to admire
the ladies more than did the officers and men of
his own special ship. He unfortunately wiped off
the good impression of this toothsome sweet, by
getting so hopelessly tangled up in the Parramatta
Raver and the ten Mayoresses of the River
villages that he suggested, as an old-age home of
rest for the fighting flag, the Parramatta Mayoral
chair.
The new Parramatta flag revived an old super-
stition of the Victorian age. It was aggres-
sively said, in printer’s ink, that while Ad-
mirals might whistle for a wind till they were
black in the face and blue in their remarks, no
sooner did the then girlish Queen of Britain
advance to the “ God Save ” brass band, than flags
which had been lying flat down on their faces
would promptly get the necessary puff of wind to
make them sit up and take notice. The ancient
superstition has been revived in the yarn that,
when the destroyer’s new bunting was run up to
the tune of an Australian air, it fell fainting in
a limp heap round the pole. When “God Save ”
took charge, however, the one and only puff of
sea breeze that Rushcutters Bay could turn on to
the Parramatta demonstration, shook the silken
folds till, like the brocades of sixty years ago,
they stood alone. The ten mayoresses had better
mention this to the Southern Cross illuminations.
When Captain Rolleston, R.N., a benign like-
ness of the Wellington who made his presence felt
before trams ran to Waterloo—and Botany—got
his profile outlined against the Nelson figurehead,
the navy seemed to be doing its duty to the
Parramatta River without any mental reservation.
The figurehead is a relic of the old five-decker
Nelson, which ended its days in the coal hulks
trade ; and it had, as chaperon, a sixteenth-cen-
tury gun with a pert crest on its ancient Spanish
nose. Our local naval contingent, which de-
scended on China a few years ago, brought back
this venerable trophy to quell any desire on the
part of Chinese travellers to land in these attract-
ive parts.
The Admirable King-Halls have brought to
Sydney heavyweight luggage and a solid reputa-
tion for Faith and Works. Mrs. Admirable is
alleged to be securely anchored to Low
Church moorings. An immediate revival of
evangelical slippers—for curates -in - waiting
on bishoprics—and serious sales of pink
calico and blue tracts for heathen homes,
are expected to revolve round the Kirribilli
Point ferry-service. The Admirable himself, who
wears a twinkle in his eye, occasionally digresses
from ruling the waves in gold upholstery, by
descending into the common mortal garb of sad-
colored sac suits. He is going to lend his presence
to the “ What-to-do ” Exhibition in April, and is
respectfully cautioned to carry a luggage ticket
that will give a clue to his special brand of Excel-
lency. Admiral Poore had a light-hearted romp
round the last Girls’ Self-Aid Society Show, so
safely disguised in a soft hat with a wide
. verandah that he was snubbed by a dairy maiden
for asking Intelligence Department questions re
the internal troubles of a new churn, and was
cheerfully admonished not to give himself airs on
the higher ethics of polishing brass.
Miss King-Hall, as a writer on naval defence,
is a feminine machine-gun of some merit. Two
brothers in the cruiser trade (our own Admirable
is one of them) probably began in the realm of pina-
fores and curl papers to influence the sister’s mental
color by treating wax dolls as naval deserters, and
burying them before holding courts of inquiry.
Many girls have had brotherly attentions of this
kind in their childhood. Most can retaliate by
wearing their brothers’ best neckties. Miss King-
Hall has written a book about gunnery.
■Was it Thackeray who said, “The Marys who
bring ointment to our feet get but little thanks’’ ?
The tepid interest this State has shown in the
rattle of the Mary money-box is due to a whole-
hearted desire to freeze this pauperising proposal,
till the Marys who bring collection-cards to our
front doormats fail to get enough ointment to
cover one well-grown corn. It once happened to
be my bread-and-butter business to chase the
present Queen in her York pilgrimage through
Commonwealth curtsies in many cities. Her
(now) Britannic Majesty struck every pen-holder
who had to persistently approach her presence as
one of the most strong-minded, able-bodied women
who ever set a solid foot (size six or thereabouts)
on the sickening adulation of social climbers. To
scratch round suburban villas for pence to lay at
the hem of Mary’s Coronation robes is in a bee-
line with spilling soda-water and sentiment on the
blunt face of North Head.
A salt sea-breeze from Port Phillip has just
brought a whiff of barracouta and an unreliable
rumor. The latter affirms that Captain Griffiths,
who is habitually R.A.A., is going to enter into
the bonds of wedding-cake, bridesmaids, bangles
and shower-bouquets, with a Queenscliff damsel.
Mr. Tall-and-dark Moreton Williams, who is
known to the Ancient Armory Department as a
young lieutenant in the R.A.A. and to the small
boys of Watson’s Bay as a shack of gilt-edged gun-
powder with no frills, was laid out by the Defence
authorities for removal to Westralia last Satur-
day. To the light infantry, that skirmishes in
knickerbockers and sun-tanned soles round the
oyster-memorial shellsofCampCove, Mr. Williams,
in charge of the target-tug Miner, was a gunnery
god who would stand still on return to solid
sand and fire off answers to unarmed Boy notes of
interrogation. Ballarat will be interested to hear
that he is following the prevailing fashion in
khaki circles by taking to himself a bride. The
little lady’s name before the orange-blossom cere-
mony of last week was Fenwick. Mrs. R. A. A.
Williams will meet the domestic problem—as a
daily duty—in Albany.
Mr. Macdonald, a Queenslander from force of
early habit, and a lieutenant in the “regular ” regi-
ment of red-stripe gunners, has just done two
years, without hard labor, on Thursday Island.
He will immediately vary this arduous defence of
tropic climes, with pearl-shell trimmings, by
achieving the adjutancy of the artillery uniform
in Victoria. If the census leaves Mr. Macdonald
enough breath to reply to more inquiries about his
personal intentions, he will, early in April, cheer-
fully go through the marriage-ceremony cate-
chism with Miss Ochiltree, daughter of a late
Ballarat surgeon.
Miss Flora Wright, who recently changed her
name and address—aided and abetted by St.
Philip’s Church and one bridesmaid—for Dansey
and Dubbo, originally claimed Wellington (M.L.)
as her first choice in wet streets. She was latterly
one of a limited company of two bright girls who
attacked art needlework in this city with such
vigor that Lily Bray ton gave more than her
presence to the Wright-Brindley colored silk
conspiracy. The firm is now permanently broken
up. Miss Winnie Brindley—the bridesmaiden
who assisted St. Philip in his matrimonial troubles
on March 18—has chosen April 7 and Mr. Jackson
(who hails from the classic groves of Darling
Point dog-carts) as an excuse for wedding bells
and silver-plated speeches.

Every other home in Girl-urine, is suffering
from acute almonditis. When the hungry—and
alleged—head of the house gets home from work,
he finds the dining-room table buried under
almond blossoms. They are made of white tissue-
paper. The Man does not recognise them as
coming within the Pure Food Act. If he meekly
asks whether he can grill himself a piece of stale
bread or toast his nose before the kitchen fire, he
is fiercely assaulted by young persons who look
incapable of hurting a hatpin. They explain
briefly: “Kitchen full of flowers. What-to-do
Exhibition.”
Male songs of thanksgiving are liable to be
arrested for disorderly conduct in Sydney streets
when the Countess of White Camellias declares
the What-to-do Ex. to be well and truly laid open
to the public shilling on Referenda day. The
almond blossom will then hang itself with im-
punity, and cease to strangle the better feelings
of otherwise happy homes.
Miss Farran, believed to have been the first
woman to qualify here in the Agricultural course,
is a budding orchardist who is entered for a
practical pruning demonstration, when “What-to-
do ” drives the City Fathers to drink cold water on
the outer kerb of their usually girl-proof sanctuary.
Miss Moss-Vale Farran is going to include
a bee display in her slice of country life. Any
complaints of insulting behavior, on the part of
the bee-farm, will be promptly attended- to with
bluebags and pincers by the organising sec. Girl-
scouts, who will defend the opening ceremony to
the last feather, might also arm themselves with
the fire-hose, to resist any attempt of queen bees
to occupy front seats on the platform.
North Sydney is gathering itself together, to
consider a church-fitting memorial to Edward
the Amiable. The idea is to supply St. Thomas
with a steeple. Mrs. Mayoress Milson intends to
climb 300 feet of atmosphere, in her unshaken
resolve to hit the overseas tourist in the eye.
Hitherto the tourist has divided his attention (off
Watson’s Bay drainage system) between putting
out his tongue to a medical research party, and
answering banal questions, such as “ Do you see
our Harbor? Are you a desirable immigrant or
a derelict duke?’* He will, when St. 1 nomas
wears an Edward-memorial top-hat, find sur-
cease of sorrow by asking the saloon
piano. “Have I seen your spire?” Mrs.
Milson intends to re-make herself into an non.
collecting card, that will not be appeased
by anything under £lOOO. She is also threatening
a successful sale of work. Energy of this white-
heat order-of-merit ought to be firmly chained to
North Sydney’s town hall, and not allowed to
wander into foreign parts.
Bendigo is now going to “ Gather Ye Rosebuds ”
to a new melody, the harmonious handicraft of
the veteran Dr. Oliver Penfold, of the City of
Many Voices, Golden Foundations and alluvial
day-dreams.
Dr. F. Rodway, of Barraba, and his wife and
small daughter are passing over this harbor in
the course of their flight to the solar-eclipse “at
home,” in the sun-burnt Isle of Vavau.
A rubbish tin, vociferously ejecting its contents,
was the chief sign of human habitation in the
tipper precincts of 14 Moore-street during the
earlier part of an evening in last week. The Aus-
tralian Dramatic Authors’ Association had politely
requested “the honor of your interest and the
pleasure of your presence at the Women’s
Patriotic Club Rooms.” A forlorn hope of three
attacked several consecutive and aggressive stair-
cases, comforted by the thought that a Hilhouse-
Taylorreading would soothe even housemaid’s knee
and mend holes in threadbare tempers. Patriotic
gas was turned off at the meter. The pleasure of
our presence had been postponed. The rejected
three and the rubbish-tin parted with mutua
ferocity.
Nelson Illingworth, junior, has recently climbed
to higher altitudes than those usually attacked by
the semi-quavers of youthful song-writers. A
slim and paper-roofed “Lyric Album ” (published
by Nicholson’s) holds eight new settings to songs,
known and otherwise. A pretty cradle-song
(words by Fred J. Broomfield) might be tried, as
a novelty not yet exploited, on the back teeth of
the most ferocious twin between midnight and
morning tea.
Miss Ruby Adams, the Sydney soprano, is on
her way to Australia, where she means to give a
series of concerts. She put in two years’ study
with Marchesi, Bouhy and Albani, and then did
an immensely successful tour of Ireland with
Joseph O’Mara’s concert party. The portrait I
send you shows the lady wearing the latest French
fringe.
Henry Tebbitt’s water-color exhibition in Alden-
hoven s gallery is drawing a steady stream of
coin, that falls down with a loud splash before
the blue distances of his mountain gorges. Local
art circles are alleged to sniff at the quality of art
that Tebbitt’s gum trees, gullies and water
escapes display to the unsophisticated purse.
This strikes the metallic note of difference
between a paying public, which has acquired the
permanent habit of buying Australian timber,
served up in fascinating green, gold and grey
dressing by Tebbitt, and the criticism of step-
brothers of the brush who take a “colored photo-
graph ” attitude in front of the Tebbitt technique.
Manly’s croquet-ground had a determination of
aluminium saucepans to tiie head of its best mal-
lets, early in last week. Doctors’ wives pre-
vailed. More than one member of Parliament is
said to have graced this scrubbing-brush soiree
with his personal appearance, as a token of respect
for the Nurses’Nations Fair—the axis on which
Manly croquet-balls revolved.
Mrs. and Miss Buss are amongst the Christ-
church (M.L.) contributions, per Moldavia, to
George and Mary’s June party —or its vicinity.
The family of Buss belongs to the old-resident,
highly-respected citizen type, and is chiefly
remarkable for its large and amiable assortment
of girls, who have been so devoted to each other,
in the Mid-Victorian “Small House at Ailing-
ton ” manner, that nothing less than a Coronation
bomb would have smashed up their desire to
paddle their own canoe on the limpid shallows of
the Avon.
Mrs. Neale, whose death has enriched so many
N.S.W. charities, was the daughter of John Bull,
not of the well-known United Kingdom business
firm, but of Liverpool (N.S.W.) Mr. Bull, who
is. said to have had some connection with the
N.S.W. Corps, settled at Liverpool in the teens
of last ceptury. In the days of pork-pie hats and
crinolines, Miss Bull married J. T. Neale. The
estimable old lady had as brothers Henry Bull, of
London, and Nathaniel Bull, who once wore
M.L. A. as a tail to his surname.
Returning to Sydney, per Orvieto and taxi-cab,
are Mrs. J. Mann and Miss Eva Mann, who have
been in European capitals, with a successful look-
in at Karlsbad, for nearly two years.
Fashion appears to be limping between the
hobble skirt and the wider knee movement.
Dressmakers are modifying their remarks re the
necessity for every fashionable woman to fall off
tram steps when she descends to macadam.
Gathers are in the air.
New tones threaten, every spring and autumn,
to distract the plain man who knows the primary
difference between a feather-duster and Maria’s
new hat. This season “ Mogul ”is likely to cause
a storm of controversy to shriek round our old
familiar friend, Amethyst.
Though Sain Marsden was, to all intents, Aus-
tralia’s first parson—Johnson, who looked in and
fled, never took serious stock of first-fleet souls—
it is worth noting that absolutely the first foot of
theology to leave its track on Botany Bay sands
belonged to a French friar named Le.Receuveur,
naturalist, and man of scientific yearnings. Le
Receuveur found nothing but a grave. La
Perouse buried him about a fortnight after first-
fleet anchors shivered the timbers of aquatic
circles in Port Jackson.
Madame Paquin, recently interviewed by a
London paper, jumps with French heels on the
harem digression from skirts. Madame du Gast,
a great sport in' petticoats, is alleged to
clinch this argument by saying "Detestable!”
In this opinion they have both bumped up
against the militant feelings of Dr. Madeline
Pelletier, a French suffragette. The redoubtable
leader of Feminists says “she sees in it [harem] a
release from the moral servitude in which the
tyrant man has for ages kept her sex.” Made of
Turkey twill, with sultan trimmings, the baggy
breeches of the seraglio seem a curious method of
expressing emancipation from down-trodden,
head-chopping servitude.
Mrs. Neil McEacharn, Mr. and Mrs. Vallange,
Mrs. R. Muirhead Collins, Mrs. George Chirn-
side, Mrs. ex-Mayoress McEacharn and other
Anglo-Australians are accused of having
been present at Mrs. Charles Buckley’s
anti-Socialist reception in London last month.
One member of the Bull family (Sir Wil-
liam) is reported to have been unfortunately
prevented from appearing. The anti-gathering,
with countesses as common as hundreds and
thousands at a child’s party, had a sprinkling of
royalty in the person of Princess Blucher. This
interesting collection of Paris frocks and family
diamonds is reported to have made severe
remarks on “the dangers that threaten the
thrifty.”
A certain standard in front gates is said to be
strictly observed by a Sydney perfect lady, who
never calls on anything of less importance than a
large iron gate with a monogram in its middle.
The nearest undertaker is alleged to be less in-
sistent than society in this respect.
Yours, with a broad nib,
VANDORIAN.
The Commonwealth Electoral Office uses
other columns of this issue to tell the public
exactly what the people are asked to say “Yes”
or “No ” to on April 26. There are two questions
to be answered—one relating to industries, the
other to monopolies. The notice sets out the
words of the Constitution which are to be erased
and the new ones which are to be inserted.
Talking of “ colonials ” who have satin
the British Parliament, an English paper says
that the first Australian to arrive in the Com-
mons was T. C. Anstey, a Tasmanian barrister,
who won an Irish constituency in the ’so’s.
Anstey is just about forgotten ; but not so the
next man—albino “Bobby ” Lowe, afterwards
Viscount Sherbrooke, who left a seat in the Ma
State’s Legislative Council to commence an
eminent career in English polities. Alex,
and W. A. McArthur followed; they were
two Sydney softgoods bosses. Melbourne
has been represented, among others, by
Samuel Wilson, donor of Wilson Hall to the
Melbourne University; J. F. Hogan, a well-
known journalist and literary person ; Dr. Arthur
Lynch, journalist and much else ; and H. C. E.
Childers, the first Victorian Agent-General, who
was once a tally clerk on the Yarra bank.

“ Tommy tHe Hawker His Boy Snifter.”
By EDWARD DYSON, author of “ The Golden Shanty,” etc.
Fully Illustrated. Price 1/-, Post Free 1/3.
Tommy the Hawker is a “character,” and Snifter is not one whit behind. This is essen-
tially a humorous book ; but it is something more, for on various occasions the Hawker shows
himself to be a man of parts—cool, calcplating, daring and courageous. The stratagem by
which he, single-handed, captured two bushrangers is in itself worth buying the book for, and
his raiding of the Chinese gambling den is a fine example of what nerve, resource and courage
can accomplish.
“TOM PAGDIN—PIRATE.”
By E. J. BRADY. With Four Full-Page Illustrations by LIONEL LINDSAY.
Price 1/- Postage 3d.
Buccaneering in the olden days was the sailor-man’s dizzy limit, and every youth who found
the home-life humdrum made up his mind to run away to sea and eventually become a pirate.
“But there are no pirates in Australia,” you say. Well! just you read “Tom Pagdin,”
and you will find enough adventure packed into a few weeks’ pirating to suit the veriest
gI Ut Fights, robberies, cannibalism, murder and heroism fairly stumble over each other, while
the ultra-seriousness of the youthful pirates becomes so positively ludicrous that even a mute
must be amused. . .
The author is to be congratulated on striking an entirely new vein.
“EROS! EROS WINS!”
A new Racing Novel by F. AGAR. Illustrated by PERCY SPENCER.
Paper Cover, 1/- Postage 3d.
“Eros,” be it known, was the Greek god of love, and, as love generally wins, it was
thought a good name for a horse. But even a good horse is not always allowed to win, and
many of the doubtful methods of preventing him are exposed in this book. Both the upper
and under sides of “ The Turf” are depicted here—the aristocratic, straight-going owner, and
the low-down swindler who lives on the game ; but the little Greek god has also an interesting
innings, as there is a fascinating society love-story running side by side with the racing yarn,
and the outcome of the plot and counter-plot is that again “Eros” wins.
To those who don’t know much about racing, this book will be an eye-opener; to those
who do, it will be a treat.

THE, STECK PIANOLA PIANO
The Objedt of
Giving is to
Bestow
Pleasure.
fsd
The Object of
Giving; is to
Bestow
Pleasure.
ONE reason for the Steck Pianola Piano’s popularity as a gift is that it
furnishes LASTING pleasure. Most gifts, no matter how great
their cost, soon lose their novelty. But the fascination of the Steck
Pianola Piano renews itself with each new piece of music.
i
It is a peculiarity of good music that the more you hear of it, the more
you want. And the Steck Pianola Piano keeps step with your growing
musical appreciation, leading constantly into pathways of greater and greater
allurement.
Consider the STECK PIANOLA PIANO from the purely amusement
standpoint—think of the delightful home musicales that might enliven the
long evenings, the informal dances, the reviews of opera (grand and comic),
the great show-pieces that are never heard except on the concert platform.
Then, when you add the educational advantages to young and old, doesn’t
the appeal of the STECK PIANOLA PIANO become wholly irresistible ?
IMPORTANT. —If you have reached the point where music in the home
seems essential to the happiness of the family, do not make the mistake
of supposing that there are other instruments just about as good as the
STECK PIANOLA PIANO.
It is the Pianola Company that has developed this wonderful field which
so many others are now trying to enter.
When the STECK PIANOLA PIANO was originally introduced,
“ Player-Pianos ” were unknown.
Only at Pianola Hall can you obtain the PIANOLA and STECK
PIANOLA PIANO. Other firms have other Players, for which extravagant
claims are made, but the PIANOLA continues everywhere to be regarded as
the Standard. It is the only instrument of the kind which has the hearty
support of the musical world, and which is bought by the most discriminating
class of purchasers here and abroad. Let us send you one of our catalogues.
We will send it free if you will write us. Ask for Catalogue C.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 27, 1911-
My Dear Yarbie,—
Lady Carmichael, as president, takes the chair
at the annual meeting of the Victorian Arts and
Crafts Society on Friday, April 7, for the last
time. I anticipate that the occasion will be
rather a gloomy one, and that the starting tear
will have to be furtively dabbed up.
The Dudley Bush Nursing scheme, which died
and was given decent burial at an official meet-
ing, was resuscitated by Lady Carmichael and
made a Victorian matter Lady Dudley came,
back from Sydney and interested herself, in the
Carmichael effort, which has been successfully
started. Now all the glory is being awarded to
the Countess. Half-column interviews with her
are sprinkled with references to “my” scheme
and “my ” views. The latest trick of the music-
hall jugglers is for one to quietly hand the other
the twinkling clubs or cataract, of dinner-plates
without a word. The Governor-ladies seem to be
just as adept with their joint jobs; but, unlike
the jugglers, they don’t share the applause.
Some of the thirty thousand or so Australians
who are boutid for the Coronation have already
arrived in London, and the first catspaws of
gossip have blown out by post. Of course, it is
mostly dress. Nowanights touches of vivid red
like young flames complete the smart toilettes.
Dainty little real lace caps, at several guineas a
stitch, are a craze for evening wear. One chatter-
box saw Mrs. Wallace at the Carlton in a pale
lilac evening gown, with one of these priceless bits
upon her smooth brown hair; and the chat-
terer says the lately much-discussed looked a
dream.
The Saturday afternoon crowd were baulked of
their aviation show again this week ; a north-
west wind got up, so the biplane wisely stood on
its wheels. Hammond flew in the morning,
however, just when the people whose time is not
their own were getting ready for their bacon and
eggs. There were only a few early birds on the
scene to watch him. Mrs. Rubber Edwards got
her long-promised soar at 7 a.m., and Mr. Hubby
Edwards followed later. Sporting Surgeon
O’Hara also trusted his solid weight to the
machine. (He has taken worse risks behind the
half-broken horses he used to drive before he took
to motoring.) For the joy of going heavenwards
for half an i hour the passengers paid their 20:
guineas apiece. V.R.C: Byron Moore has been
a keen watcher of the flights. He gets his glasses
glued on the machine and does not . miss a
move, till it dips gracefully back to earth.
Aviator Hammond has the valuable gift of in-
spiring confidence in femajes who yearn to fly,
but stand shivering on the brink. During the
week he has. taken several. ladies up to heights
which only the winged variety of angel has hither-
to reached. Mrs. Levien and Mrs. Harvey Pat-
terson wete perhaps the pioneer ladies—here, at
any rate—-to go a-skylarking. Mrs. Harvey Pat-
terson is big and fair, knows how to use the foils,
and is a fine swimmer. Before her, marriage,, she
taught growing Amazons how to fence and wear
the neatest athletic costume a woman can don.
There is a rush of women would-be passengers
now, all anxious to have a flight before the air-
man departs for Sydney.
A gardener said, “ Hurry up, Miss, and you’ll
see an arum.” This was in the Botanical Gar-
dens. A sprint and scramble discovered, not a
new lily, but two unveiled females parading
Pasha skirts for the benefit of a photographer.
“ Pull out that left trouser just a Tce-tle bit,
please,” murmured the plain-speaking man behind
the camera. The adjustment was made, the
shutter clicked, and I moved on to find and con-
sider the lilies.
Harem skirts were worn in Melbourne last
winter without exciting much comment. At the
ball for the Foundling Hospital one set of Lancers
was a Turkish delight of white, silver and red.
Mrs. Harper-Bell, Mrs. Nuttall, Mrs. Charlie
Tait and Mrs. Scott were the wearers. They
looked sweet, too, until they waltzed. The cos-
tume is not a graceful one to revolve in ; but that
is no drawback from a staid, every-day point of
view.
Said that Hon. Michael Scott is returning to
the country of his forebears for good and all, and
not for Coronation merely. Wife and daughter
(aged 3) have gone with him. The Hon. Michael
was thought to be quite settled on the land at
Traralgon ; but, seemingly, his golfinginMelbourne
didn’t fit in with agricultural pursuits. So he is
off the land.
“Lucky Durham,” at Theatre Royal, was un-
lucky for "Lady Dudley. On the way out from the
show she lost a hatpin. Many a woman has done
this before; but, then, many a woman’s best hat-
pin is not like the Countess’s. This one had a big
diamond in the knob surrounded by six smaller
diamonds. A.D.C.’s and other helps diligently
searched the premises after the performance, but
the gee-gaw kept in hiding.
Artist Mather had Governor Carmichael to
speak for him at the opening of his “view” in
the upper chamber of the Athenaeum. Mather
stayed with the Carmichaels at the Macedon cot-
tage, and the exhibition includes a number of
views from the vice-regal eminence. There are
several pictures which represent striking light
effects, notably that of a dark ilex grove (rarely
seep in Australia) in sharp contrast with a stretch
of open country which has been either ringbarked
or burnt off. the tea-tree pictures are delightful,
and the acquisitive visitor who hasn’t forgotten to
bring his purse will do well to look hard at a folio
of fine water-color sketches which are to be had at
handy prices.
This week’s batch of Coronation immigrants in-
cludes the Borsdorff family—pa, ma and two-year-
old daughter. Mr. Louis Borsdorff it is who has
helped materially to shape the social forms of
Australia by importing a famous brand of corsets.
He has a large warehouse in Melbourne full of
things never seen in public except on illustrated
posters and newspaper ads. His consignments
from the Continong are law in many of the best-
regulated families, andsomeof thestraightest-laced
women in Melbourne are—well, they are pretty
much what Borsdorff has made ’em, creatures of
the environment which he provides.
What a numerous brotherhood of wholesale
chemists and druggists are the Grimwades, of
Felton) Grimwade and Co., Melbourne! The
family deficiencies of bachelor Felton, who be-
queathed the ill-used fund to Melbourne Art
Gallery, are fully counterbalanced by the Grim-
wade side of the firm. One of the family, who is
jaunting to Europe, gave a dinner recently to the
senior members of the staff, and four other Grim-
wades helped the staff to eat it. The detachment
of relatives consisted of two brothers and two sons
of the host.
The first of the local Smart Set to drive her own
motor is Mrs. Stuart Murray ,_ the dashing
Frankie Oliver of former days. In a light mac.
and violet silk American panama, the matron
looks the sporty part to perfection, and toot-toots
to the manner born.
The Whiting charmers are about again. Father
“ Bob ” went to Adelaide to meet them and bring
them back to Melbourne. After a stay at Menzies’
the family will resume home-life at the old
address, with their new motor brougham in the
garage. Mrs. Whiting, who looks hardly a day
younger than 35, seems to have increased her
stock of vitality ; the elder girl is perhaps more
reposeful than ever ; and the younger—just 19—
looks like Madame Recamier in high glee. She
had her hair cut whilst she was down with a tever
in London, and is now wearing it in cluste.s of
semi-curls, which are becoming to her face and
charmingly odd.
Harry De Little, of Caramut, has locked up his
station home and gone into residence at the
Queen’s-road mansion of the Broekhoffs, who are
on their way to the ancient city where the Corona-
tion will occur.
“Johnny” Meagher, the citizen who inherited
£BO,OOO a while ago, is going to give his riches a
chance to diminish on the , turf. Thus far the
“sport of kings” has suited Johnny amazingly
well. He won £lO,OOO by backing trainer Cooper’s
big “double” at the Flemington races, and now
he is buying gee-gees for the fortunate Cooper to
train, and has registered his colors—Orange and
purple. The name of his first purchase—Golden
Point—sounds like a good omen for the extensive
stud of racers he has in view. Mr. Meagher
is a stepson of Dr. Bride ; and the ring of
gladness in the doc.’s name was rather out of
keeping with his gloomy occupation of curator of
deceased persons’, estates. So it doesn’t follow
that Golden Point points to gold—except as re-
gards expenses.
■ Rita Kiddle, who never leaves her Saratogas
long unpacked, is off again to England and Paris,
where the smart frocks are plotted and composed
to soft music.

ing out in June to unveil his father’s statue, i 3 to

Dr. Linjsay, who went to London some months
ago to visit some of his artistic family now resi-

Painter Hal Waugh is making the most of the
autumn, driving round the absurdly-prosperous
Riverina, and getting glimpses of Arcadian land-
scapes on canvas before winter arrives. He in-
tends holding a view later on.
Picture shows of the stationary variety con-
• tine to thrive lustily. Miss Baskerville and Miss
George drew a hundred or more guests to the
Guild Hall general exhibition to view their two
charming corners, take afternoon tea, and enjoy a
programme of music directed by Miss Kitty
Gleeson. Miss Lena Conly, a sister of Mary
Conly and the possessor of a sweet soprano, con-
tributed a song or two ; a handsome tenor inter-
preted Goring Thomas; and a beautiful youth,
curly-haired and dreamy, patted soulful accom-
paniments. Also, Miss Hume Black, who
trails a string of letters after her name,
wailed romances on the contralto strings of her
’cello. Miss Baskerville, in blue, and Miss George,
in champagne color, received at the head of the
stairs. Miss Baskerville had none of her
“sculps” on view, as they are to be shown at the
Salon during the week ; but she made an attrac-
tive corner in canvas. Miss George had a nest of
miniatures and a great many soft, sly kooka-
burras among her show. One miniature is an
excellent copy of a notable portrait of Queen
Anne —or of Anne in her “ princess ” days. The
much-discussed original is in the hands of a Mel-
bourne art lover.
The array of pictures in the Guild Hall’s per-
manent market is rather terrifying at first sight;
but the leisurely gazer will find good things at
every visit. I found a Phil May drawing of
Queen Victoria distributing Jubilee mugs to the
slum children of London. “Thank you, Mum,”
chatters one chilled bundle of rags ; “I have one
mug already, but I haven’t got nuffink to put in
it.” A beautiful Bertram Mackennal bronze is
stowed away in a corner, and has to be searched
for.
An amusing extract from the Guild Hall cata-
logue :
No. 184.—Tintern Abbey. Arthur Suker. £B5. This
artist never sells a picture this size under £5O in
England.
This city is either regarded as an art bargain-
counter, or else some artists in England are used
to selling their canvas by the acre.

The dressing in “ Lucky Durham ” is a . st , ud T ?“

with expensive simplicity. She has hystencs in a
beautifully-fitting blue gown of which the bodice
has parts scooped .cleanly out, and the vacancies
filled with net which appears to be glued on to
the wearer’s arms and neck. There is a grey crepe-

As for Florence Grel ton and Ethel Bashford, onede-

onlv an odd fringe here and there on youi'narrow
tubed gown. Economists may be interested to
know that the fashionable gowns of the moment
which only contain four yards of material—are
rather more expensive than yesterdays, which
required 14 yards. The price goes up as the stuff
cuts down. Same illogical principle applies to
hats. The hat of the minute has no trimming—
or practically none. You may see four miniature
satin rosebuds on its brim, or several fat little
grev apples on the brim-turn nothing more.
Yet women put down heaps of golden guineas for

Vegetable pathologists the world over have
hitherto been baffled by “bitter pit,’ the mys-
terious disease which attacks the apple. How-
ever, a daughter of Eve may do something towards
ouring the afflicted fruit. Dr. Jean White, of the
botanical section of Melbourne University, is
after the trouble with her microscope. She
spends hours every day examining sections cut
from apples collected from all parts of the coun-
try. If she runs the germ down, it will be a
feather in her Marie Antoinette cap that is,

Someone sends me word of the two go-ahead
Butler girls who ran a florist’s shop in Melbourne.
Nancy Butler is on the stage in New York, and
has the part of first bridesmaid in “Our Miss
Gibbs.” The other sister is in London, and is
engaged to a real Count, who hails frpm or reigns
in Milan. When she is his CountQss, she is to
dwell in a marble palace which the npbleman has
had scrubbed down for her.
A day-long voyage on our wide bay is apt to be
exciting if the wind gets up. The recent Sunday
storm which overwhelmed the yacht Mavis caught
the excursion steamers on the homeward trip, and
made them twirl about on the face of the waters
like sunstruck turkeys. It was impossible for
them to pick up some of the unhappy excursionists
who had been landed at one stopping place ; con-
sequently, the stormbound ones, who were unpre-
pared for such an emergency, had to look for
lodgings for the night, while worried elders and
Mrs. Grundy wailed and snorted at the town ends
of the wires—which were mostly interrupted.
Aspendale had its own sensation. The stormy
sea ate up the beach and licked the back doors of
the bungalows, while a schooner writhed and
twisted at its anchor chains close in, and a. yacht
blew raggedly ashore, leaving half a dozen Brighton
yachtsmen to swim shorewards over the reef.
Campers took the exhausted men in as soon ms
they landed, and spread wet men and sails round
about their hospitable fires. These shivering
remnants of the Mornington-St. Kilda yacht race
afterwards had to hire a tug at a cost of £2O to
tow their boat off. There was talk of running a
summer ferry-boat service between Mordialloc,
Mornington, and the nearer suburban sea places ;
but the idea seems to have been dropped or blown
down for the present.
Some Svdney notes mention that mummer Hig-
ginson (who rusticates at Middle Harbor when he
is not being vacuously pleasant on the stage) is
“learning” to play the flute. That’s awfully
rough on Higgy, seeing that the wailful instru-
ment has been his great consoler—at any rate, all
his Australian life. When he lived at a certain
tavern in Melbourne, the neighbors always said :
“There’s Higgy down in the dumps again”
whenever they heard a plaintive twittering on the
breeze.
The Boobooks is the title of a limited and
exclusive club of men who meet in Melbourne at
monthly dinners, after which one of the somnolent
night birds wakes up sufficiently to address Ins
feathered brethren upon some abstruse subject.
No member of our gentle and unargurpentati ve sex
is permitted to grace the proceedings ; but a man
spy who attended a booty gathering last week
whispers that Dr. Felix Meyer, art connoisseur
and good fellow, filled in the latter half of a jolly
evening with observations on the habits of
European owls and the art galleries of Paris and
other things. Artist John Longstaff sat at the
right hand of boss mopoke Joshua, and listened
with the others.

one dull day of Melbourne’s recent dampest
period, that a wealthy bachelor, who is philoso-
phical as regards most troubles, women included,
talked bitterly of going for a spin in his motah.
The girl he wanted to take was not on for the
outing. “I know it’s beastly cold and muddy,”
said the bored, bachelor. The drive would be
rotten ; but I’m paying a-fCllow £3'a week to run

Phillips Oppenheim’s last bit of sensational-
ism, “The Missing Delora,” boasts this para-

My Adelaide correspondent writes
The Man with the Scythe has been busy in this village.
On Monday the Town Hall bells tolled for the death of
R. C. Baker, at' one time a well-known figure in public
and sporting circles. For years the Baker homes in
North Adelaide and at Morialta were centres of jovial hos-
pitality ; but the knight’s failing health and the death c f
His popular wife instituted a quieter order of things.
Their daughter Adelaide is known as one of our hand-
some and smart girls.
The Sisters of the L.C.M., who wear picturesque blue
“habits” and have nursed back to health an assorted
clientele, including vice-regalities, actors and the deserv-
ing poor, lost one of their number this week, and all
those who have been inside the doors of the spacious hos-
pital are genuinely sorry.
The plan of turning public anniversaries into movable
feasts and celebrating them o’ Mondays gave Adelaide’s
Irishmen an excuse* for saying “Hurroo" twice. On
Saturday they were resplendent in green, and extolled
the virtues of their patron, and on Monday they wore
more green and ext.olled:him again.
As the Referenda polling day draws nearer the voice
of the politician grows louder. Prime Minister Fisher is
booked to speak in the Town Hall on Monday, and Alfred
Deakin on the following Thursday. Mayor Cohen
announces that the dress circle is to be divided between
“ ladies of the Trades Hall and Liberal parlies” ; but he
does not say if a barrier is to be erected to prevent blood-
shed.
We have a Ladies’ Club—and we have the harem skirt.
The crowd collected round a Rundle-street clothes
store hints of a fire, or/a least a murder; but investi-
gation reveals nothing mote than two comely damsels
clad in somewhat lengthy bloomers. Fashion must have
her way, but lovely wom&n is discarding from trumps
when she doffs her frills.
Which reminds me that. Adelaide fashion-caterers have
their growl; they object to Melbourne firms stepping
over for a week and going off with many orders and
much cash. Shoppers say that local supplies are out-of-
date, and annoyed drapers snap back that local shoppers
don’t know what is out-of-date.
Strathalbyn, in the Southern hills, lately put on its
best clothes, tidied its polo ground and held revelifor
two days, the excuse being the visit of the Mount Craw -
ford poloists. Strathalbyn is a pretty little village, and

occasions the Stirlings, of the Lodge, open their hearts
and their comfortable home to all comers.
A wedding of interest to the squatting fraternity is
billed for mid-April. The principals are a Hawker belle
and a moneyed young McFarlane. Both families

distinct style of her own.

Admiral King-Hall is visiting us this week-end, and is

HAD TO CIVE UP
SGHOOLTEAGHINO
This Girl's Health Wrecked
by Anaemia.
*
Her Mother Tells how She
was Cured.
An account of a young school teacher, who be-
came so run down in anaemia that she had to give
up her profession, is given by her mother, Mrs.
Annie Stuart, of Orsmond Street, Hindmarsh,
Adelaide. Mrs. Stuart consents to the publication
of the facts becausll her daughter was completely-
cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and the
summer climate of Australia being so trying for
young people, the experience should benefit a great
number. Above everything these pills are for
anaemia, as they actually combine with food and
air to increase the blood supply. Mrs. Stuart,
whose husband carr.ies on an outfitter’s'business
nearly opposite the Bowden Railway Station,
said : A
“At about the age of 17 years my daughter,
who was a school teacher at the time, became vefcy
anaemic, and she became so bad that she had
leave school. Her face became very pale and her
body wasted away. She completely lost her
appetite and suffered most excruciati lg pains in
the head and often in the legs. When her bead
ached very bad she used to become cold all over,
especially her hands and feet. Her nerves were
much out of order and she suffered neuralgic pains
in various parts of her body. One day my hus-
band brought home some boxes of Dr. Williams
Pink Pills, and my daughter started using them,
as she had been treated by the lodge doctor for
some time without benefit. In about a fortnight s
time we all noticed an improvement in her health,
and she continued their use for some time when
she became thoroughly cured, and she has never
had a relapse since. My husband has also used
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills with great benefit.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are 2s. 9d. per box, six
boxes 15s. 3d., of all medicine dealers, Or from the

POLITICAL
POINTS
Showing English cos. a way to evade the
Australian progressive land tax, a writer in the
London Financial Times says
It seems to me that the proper thing for English land
companies to do is to register a separate undertaking for
each property they hold in the Commonwealth, transfer
the requisite land to it, and use the present organisation
simply as a holding company. A company registered in
the colony cannot be an alien, and the reduced v.ilue of
etch holding would bring the tax down to the lower
ligures.
What a delightfully frank rogue Fat is ! Not, of
course, that this is roguery. It is “business.”
The suggestion, however, serves one good pur-
pose. It shows how necessary it is for the
Commonwealth to be given the power it is now
seeking to control public companies, and to block
the registration of concerns that may be formed
expressly to defeat a Commonwealth law.
THE EXECUTIONER.
Australia has an opportunity on the 26th April.
British suffragettes threaten to dodge the
census, and blot themselves out of the numbered
population, because they are denied a vote. If
there are any mothers of young families among
the suffragettes, they will, presumably, take little
Willie, and little Alphonso, and little Emmeline
and the littlest Dorothy out with them for the
night too, because these blue-eyed infants haven’t
a vote either, and what is sauce for the goose
should be sauce for the gosling.
The Westralian Education Department is
another concern that ought to be ashamed of it-
self. It recently advertised for “an unmarried
man as resident first assistant at the Training-
College for Teachers.” The salary—£3oo to £350,
with board and residence —is twice as much as
many men support a family on ; yet Groperland
is evidently too blind to its responsibilities to
give the preference to a married man, and allow
him to live near the college ; or, if he must live on
the premises, to provide him with an extra room
or two.
IN COMPENSATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Kings of old, a laughter-loving brood,
Who fain would drive afar the unhappy mood,
Retained at court a merry, nimble wit,
Who jested free where’er his humor lit;
Made fun of pompous priest and lusty lord,
And baited barons proud at regal board ;
Turned all to jest with daring quaint and cool—
The Kings of old (I say) they kept a fool!
The Fates to-day, with grim and grievous wit,
On mortal things have ta’en a vengeance fit;
For regal bores to-day may jest at will
(Though oft we take their regal jesting ill);
But cap and bells are from the palace banned
And worn at large throughout the subject land ;
And thus doth Time its compensations bring,
For lo ! The fools to-day they keep a King !
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
FAIR WOMEN’S FOE.
FATNESS EASILY CONQUERED.
The more beautiful a woman is the more dis-
tressing it is for her to discover that she is rapidly
getting too fat, and has not been able to find the
proper cure. Still worse is it when she impru-
dently tries fasting, exercising, tight-lacing, and
so forth. Both health and good looks soon fly
away when such worse than useless methods are
employed. The beauty-destroying enemy can be
easily and harmlessly conquered by the most
inoffensive of weapons—cheaply, too, and without
the least bother. This is how: Go to your chemist
and ask him for the following, and either let him
mix them for you or do so yourself: One-half
ounce of Marmola, one ounce of fluid extract of
Giveyrrhiza 8.P., one ounce of pure Glycerine
8.P., and Peppermint Water to make six ounces
in all. The mixture must be taken in doses of two
teaspoonfuls after each repast. Continue this
simple treatment for a few weeks, without even a
pretence of starving or “ gymnasticating,” and
you will soon recover your charms of form, figure
and feature. Don’t worry ; the treatment will do
the thing properly.
In order to meet a constantly repeated demand,
the above prescription has been condensed in the
form of a compact and perfect tablet known as
Marmola Prescription Tablets, and those readers
who prefer them to the liquid form can obtain same
of any chemist, 3s. 6d. per box, or post free from
The Marmola Go., 7 Barrack Street, Sydney,
N.S.W.*
Penny postage will be established in Aus-
tralasia on May 1, 1911.
Swinburne, of Melbourne’s gas monopoly,
has taken the platform against the Referenda
proposals. Of course he is tremendously opposed
to the amendment giving power to the Common,
wealth to have a bout with oppressive trusts,
monopolies, etc. The Agk, which has been fight-
ing the Melbourne gas monopoly for years, and
under the State law has been able to make no
headway, must be delighted to see Swinburne on
the same platform. Also Swinburne must snigger
when he sees the Gas Co.’s chief press enemy
spiking its own gun.
Up to the 26th April next Holman,
McGowen and co. will appear in the Sydney daily
press as the most right-thinking, statesmanlike,
persecuted, eloquent and popular politicians
known to the public life of N.S.W. After that
date, they will resume their old characters in
the same press as dangerous socialists, had ad-
ministrators, men who would let criminals and
murderers loose on society, despoilers of the land-
owner with their leasehold system, and orators of
a third-rate quality whose speeches have to be
boiled down to “three sticks,” while dismal
Wade, mournful Charlie Lee, ponderous Waddell,
bad-tempered Wood, and long-winded Fitzpatrick
are reported in columns.
“ There is a majority in Australia against
the disruption of the Constitution,” the Argus
said the other day, and then proceeded, with an
unshrinking finger, to probe “Liberalism” in its
most tender spot. This majority vote “only
needs to be recorded ” —that’s all. There was the
same Tory trouble last Federal elections. The
Tories had a majority, of course, but they suffered
bitterly through the inaction of the undesirable,
1 oafish person who, the Tory thinks, would no
doubt vote for the Tory if he could be induced to
vote at all. It is splendid to hear the Argus ad-
mitting the character of the ladies and gentlemen
to whom it naturally looks for support.
Dr. Icard, of Berlin, offers a new method
of branding criminals for purposes of identifica-
tion. His plan is the injection of paraffin wax,
raising swellings under the skin that are perma-
nent but harmless:—
Good Dr. Icard, simple man,
Is plagiarising Nature’s plan ;
For Bingy Fatman, King of Crime,
Has got his swelling every time.
The Murray Government has appointed a
Commission to inquire into the alleged lax ad-
ministration of the Victorian Income
Tax Office. Accusations of various
sorts have been made by Labor-man
Prendergast, but they nearly all boil
down to the showing of favoritism to
the Big and Influential. Some tax-
payers, it is alleged, were “allowed
to pay in instalments, while poorer
tax payers were sued.” Two others,
“ though following the same pursuit,
were taxed on different lines, the
richer of the two partially escaping
the tax.” It is also declared that
one prosperous person “suppressed
information which allowed him to
escape taxation on a large amount,”
and was not prosecuted or penalised
by the Income Tax Department.
The thing, it is said, has been going
on for years—which, if true, only
shows once more how thoroughly the
State Governments can supervise everything, and
how unnecessary it is to relieve them of any of
their duties and functions.
The feature of Justice Higgins’s discourse
on “Constitutions” which stung “Liberalism”
like 18 death-adders was this harmless-lohking
sentence at the finish :—•
... The ultimate sanity of a free people must be trusted,
or nothing on earth can be trusted.
It is as obvious a truth as the mind of man can
conceive. And yet there is no.doubt that, if it is
admitted, the whole “ Liberal ” case against the
Referenda falls to the ground. “Liberalism”
does not object to the New Protection, the Common
Rule or the scotching of Trusts—or, anyhow, it says
it doesn’t. Its sole reason for imploring the workers
of Australia to vote the ticket of Adipose is that
in the event of the free citizens of the Common-
wealth giving their legislators power to do certain
things, the latter will at once go quite mad and
grossly exceed their instructions by “ overturning
the entire business of Australia,” “robbing the
■States,” and generally behaving like lunatics.
WEBSTER, 31. HR., the Dictionary of
Postal Wrongs.
Digby Denham, Bananaland’s new Pre-
mier, talked to the local Merchants’ Association
the other day, and asked the members whether
they had spoken “to their staffs” about the
terrible Constitutional changes that were threat-
ening. If somebody said to Digby Denham:
“ Oh, you’re my butterman, -ain’t you ? Well,
before I buy another pound from you, I’d like to
know what you think about State Frights,” Digby
would probably hurst with indignation, and want
to know what had become of the liberty of the
subject.
MACDOUGAL (who has called to cheer up his sick friend) : “O, ay, Death is a terrible thing,
a verra terrible thing; but, mon, it’s verra inexpensive.”
The other day the Argus printed the tale
of an embittered capitalist who had fled in des-
pair from this dreadful country. The person, it
seemed, was a moneyed Yankee who had visited
Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne to see if con-
ditions favored the opening of an enormous indus-
try in Australia. Conditions, however, were
unfavorable, for everywhere he went he dis-
covered that Labor domination was approaching
despotism. So he buttoned up his money and
left. As usual, the Argus doesn’t know the man,

seem to know him either. It is always the way.

inadvertently buttons up his name and address.
The Melbourne “ Free ” Laborers’ Union,
of 50,000 members, which four or five representa-
tives of the Employers’ Federation are struggling
to establish, is the” biggest insult yet hurled at
the intelligence of that tepid waster, the black-
leg. The idea is that there shall be a strong and
honorable combination of non-unionists, with the
pious purpose of taking over from the employers
the responsibility of fighting strikers and the
task of breaking strikes. The Free Workmen s
Society is to be prepared to rush in whenever a
strike”is declared, and take up the work in the
sacred names of Liberty and Freedom of Con-
tract. It is a capitalistic attempt to make dog
eat dog—a righteous movement on the part of
that section which is most revolted at the idea of
setting class against class.
Defence Minister Pearce showed much
sense recently by nipping in the bud the attempts
of District Headquarters to encumber the new
scheme of universal training with red tapeism
and circumlocution. Area officers had be6ir
directed to send their claims to the district pay-
master through brigade-majors. Pearce, as soon
as he made the discovery, gave instructions that
the area officers must send claims direct to the pay-
mascer. Only one of themselves knows what a
saving of time, labor and correspondence this
means.
SWINBURNE AND THE RED BANDANNA OF SOSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
But if these amendments passed, the Labor party
had two years yet to run with its majority intact. (Oh !)
With such powers they would have power to boycott any
trade, and to boycott any man. (Hear, hear.) They
could legally starve out a man. (Cheers.) They could
do that, without going to the Arbitration Court, by
direct legislation. The red flag was about the size of a
pocket handkerchief in Australia now ; but if these
powers were granted the whole continent would be red
before very long. (Cheers.). — Swi//tbu/'iic,
When the red of the rafters arrows redder
Than the red on Home’s rafters should be,
And each good golden god takes a header
And escapes o’er the sibilant spa,
You will howl in your hovels so horrid :
“ Ah, he said it, that singular star,
We were in for a time very torrid !
We certainly are ! "
Winter blows me with boycotts and butter
To exterminate trammels of trade,
And to shoo the symbolical shutter
In a nimbus of nonsense arrayed ;
You perceive the perfection of piffle
When I babble my beautiful bosh,
And exhibit to you, with a sniffle,
The Hanky of Sosh.
From the cuddled confusion of cosies,
And the languor of Liberal teas,
To the masses I proffer my posies—
Spooky speeches and smooth similes.
Oh ! be ours with a nebulous No-ness ;
For your name we shall nevermore bless
If you slimily smudge in your slowness
A horrid “ Yes-Yes.”
VICTORIA.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Sydney had a great time on Saturday. In fact,
it is doubtful if it ever had such an afternoon before.
A buckjumping show drew about 60,000 people to
see men try to ride outlaws and wild bulls; the Parra-
matta Hundred was followed by three large and
thoroughly-packed steamers, and thousands of other
people came in their own craft or lined the shore and had
a free show ; the Rosehill Cup race meeting and
a “ pony ” fixture at Rosebery Park both had their
thousands of soft-brained supporters; the N.S. W. League
of Swimmers boomed through a batch of champion-
ships ; while the regiment of bowlers, cricketers, lawn-
tennis enthusiasts and the rest all had their followers,
whose name is Legion. And, barring a few abrasions and
contusions at the buckjumping and bull-riding, there
was not an accident worth mentioning.
* * * *
Hats off to the “ Widow ” O’Brien, who made
such a mighty splash at the N.S.W. League of Wheel-
men’s carnival last week ! The “ Widow ”is a good man,
and played his game down to the very last card. Every-
body remembers how he got out of the bagf at a Sj'dney
Thousand race and wiped the floor with the opposition.
The same grit that he displayed on that famous occasion
broke out in a fresh place' last week. He is the new
referee, and he played the part of the new broom with
terrific thoroughness. He was as impartial as Death,
and just as contemptuous of status. He fell on
Percy Mutton and outed him for teaming after
winning the half-mile handicap; and he fined George
Horder and F. D. Walcott £2 each for irregularities.
Then he swept the board with a blizzard of fines for
wrong colors and breaches of other regulations until
there were wild threats of stoush, and finally, strike.
The League thereupon lost its head, removed the marks
made by the “ Widow’s” strenuous biffs, and nullified the
most heroic effort made to purify the sport. However,
that is the League’s funeral. The “ Widow ” played the
game, and is the only party who comes out of the kick-up
with credit.
* * * *
A good man to have about one in a tight pinch
is rifleman J. E. Teague, of Zeehan (Tassy). Recently he
put up “a possible” with seven shots each at 300, 600
and 700yds. Australia wants more like Teague, and it is
up to the Commonwealth to pay him a bonus on each
additional child, just to encourage the creation of acaste
of born marksmen.
* * * *
Maoriland swimming premier, M. E. Chamipon,
is off to the Coronation kick-up as a member of the
Australasian Athletic Team. He has announced that
while he is in England he will try the Channel swim, but
the chances are that before he reaches the French coast
those high notions will all have been washed away.
* * * *
The British War Office has decided to estab-
lish an “ aerial reserve,” and the men who can fly have
been invited to place themselves and their machines at
the disposal of the country. The invitations are accom-
panied by the beastly frank intimation that, as they will
not be regularly attached to the army, they will, in war-
time, in the event of capture, be liable to be shot as
civilian spies. They have a queer way of arousing enthu-
siasm in the British War Office.
* * * *
Boxing is in for trouble. The deaths of Glee-
‘-•on and Bryant in one week have given the Wowseristic
birds-in-their-little-nests-agree gang a large handle on
which it can get both paws. Gleeson, whose proper
name was John Leslie Victor Jacobson, and Bryant,
whose legal monniker ran to James Boland, died, not on
account of the extra-severity of the punishment received,
but owing to the fact that neither of them was fit to
enter a ring, and a Marathon race would have killed
them just as certainly. The prompt action of the Sydney
Stadium people in announcing that henceforth all intend-
ing pugs shall be cnrefully inspected by a doctor at the
ringside has drawn the teeth of the Wowser tiger. Also,
it will ensuie that the paying public will not be' robbed
of its money’s worth by the ill-health of the gentlemen
who supply the biff. #
The inquest on boxer Gleeson threw an inter-
esting light on Sydney suburban boxing. According to a
police witness, Mr. “ Gleeson ” called on him and made a
quaint request. Said “Gleeson”: “I’m fighting
Whittaker, and very likely I’ll be going down a
food many times. I won’t be much hurt. I
don’t want the police to stop the fight. I don’t
want you to think that I’m hurt.” And “ Gleeson ”
did go down frequently, and once too often. The in-
teresting point was that “ Gleeson ” was putting up a
faked fight on the public, and actually asked the police
to assist him in carrying it to a successful conclusion.
And, apparently, the police did not take any steps to
expose the and protect the public.
Jack Johnson, who begins to find the multi-
plieitv of fines for furious automobile driving beyond
even his purse, threatens to take to aeroplaning if the
police don’t leave him alone. And if he does to the air
retire he will call his aeroplane “ Tahmmy Burns,” and,
no doubt, enjoy the fact that till he breaks his neck he
will be on top all the time. He proposes to invest in a
14-cylinder Curtiss biplane, and, when he has mastered
the art of using it, he reckons he will just satiate that wild
craving for speed that has proved such a costly pastime.
In honor of his own color he proposes to have the
planes of his machine colored black, and that black bi-
plane is to scoop in the world’s prizes galore. Had John-
son been a white man he would have been a beauty actor,
sure ! A man with his abnormal vanity couldn’t help it.
The police are said to be' seriously considering what is to
be done, for if Jack gets going with his speed mania he
will work up to such a fearful bat that, if he strikes any
nart of the ''Amurkan continent, the U-nited Stites will
iose a hunk of territory.

Corowa (N.S.W.) race meeting last week saw
some tall riding—riding which must be in the neighbor-
hood of a record. Jockey J. J. McGrath landed four
firsts and two thirds in seven races, and brother Hyland
romped home first in five of seven races. Whispered that
the bookmakers are formjng a Camorra to deal with these
horsemen. # #
Although Australia has beaten off the S’Afri-
cans this continent has but little breathing space before
the s’truggle for the ashes will be renewed. Immedi-
ately the winter has sharpened up the nerves, a team of
plundering Englishmen will descend upon the continent;
and when that crowd is through its programme, the
Australian XI will follow it to Bull’s Land. Soothe pro-
fessional cricketer who cherishes the notion that he is
an amateur, and a gentleman amateur at that, will have
a merry and lucrative time. #
The final of the Parramatta Hundred was a
magnificent spectacle and a poor race, won by a 17-year-
old boy with a margin of about seven lengths, w.
Ripley, who hails from Newcastle, was the only one in it.
He went to the front at the jump, and stayed there, with
N. Towns and F. S. Hagney second and third, a lengtn
between them. The winner received a handicap ol
83sec., and the second and third men were on 44sec. ana
18sec. respectively. But the picture on the river which
can only be vaguely described as glorious —was worth
going 10,000 miles to see.
The Ladies’ Sculling Championship was a far
more interesting event. The skiffs with fixed seats made
the going heavy, but, ye gods, how did those two
women pull! Miss Gertie Lewis pulled a stroke
that was wonderful to see; she was a cleaner
oar-manipulator than any of the men who took
part in the final. Miss Ryan, the challenger,
also pulled magnificently, and it was not till within
50yds. of the finishing line that the result was settled.
Then Miss Ryan, whose left arm had given out, practi-
cally broke down, and failed to keep a straight course.
Miss Lewis won by three lengths. #
There was large inter-State representation in
the S. Aus. tennis championships, and the local players
had as usual, to be content with second places or worse.
Parker (N.S.W.) took the singles, and won the E T.
Smith Cup outright. Miss Stewart (Vic.) won the ladies
singles easily from Miss Parr; and, with Miss Watson
(Vic.), the doubles; and, with Fisher(M.H.A. of Maori-
land), the mixed doubles from Miss Watson and Rice
(N.S.W.). Fisher, whose first visit to Adelaide it was,
made himself immediately popular. He and Parker won
the doubles from Addison and C. N. Barnard (Vic.), after
losing two sets out of the first three. The Melbourne pair
should have won ; but, two hours before, they had played
a terrible semi-final (postponed from dusk of the previous
evening) with Bowen and Barritt, of Adelaide. One set
of this 'furious affair ran to 16-14—and that night Addison
spent in the hospital.
* * * *
Some odd points from the season’s cricket
averages. Champion batsman (on figures), Smith of
Tas. ; average, 75. Champion bowler, Cook, (Q.); 12
wickets for 118. The boomed Cotter took 35 wickets,
average 57 ; the neglected McLaren (Q.) took 26, average,
16. Whitty took 70, Hordern 67, nobody else over 40.
Ransford for his three wickets had a better average than
all the recognised bowlers except those two. Emery and
Matthews and Kelleway and Crawford were all expensive
with the ball, but smote mightily with the bat. In fact,
Australia seems full of fine run-getters who are also just
useful bowlers. Emery was above Ransford in batting,
and of other coming men McElhone and Kenny were
above Armstrong; while Barbour and Matthews top Clem
Hill, and threaten Trumper and Bardsley. There should
be developments next season. From the other end of the
lists: Solly Hill, an average of 12 ; Hopkins, twice out for
11 ; Redgrave, twice for 6. Bowlers : Facy, 1 for 59 ; Roy
Hill, 1 for 150 ; Alan Marshal, 0 for 103.
* * * *
Queensland cricketers have lately reckoned
harder than ever that one Test match should be played
in Brisbane against visiting English and S’African teams.
The Board of Control, however, still doesn't think so ;
but it compromised by arranging a match in Brisbane
between the visiting Englishmen or S’Afrioans and an
Australian eleven composed largely of Bananalanders.
A recent meeting of the Queensland Cricket Association
decided that it didn’t want any more matches of this
kind. If it can’t have a Test, it wants a match against a
Bananaland eleven—and Queensland is big enough now
to justify the change. # #
Last Saturday’s cricket in Melbourne was
merely remarkable for Collingwood’s defeat of East by
49 runs. This is the first walloping that East has re-
ceived for the present season, so that ’Wood is entitled
to express its jubilation. Harry Trott, appearing for
South against North, found the bowling to his liking,
and knocked it about with the ardor of a youth. Before
he had concluded he had banged up 130 —his third cen-
tury during the last few weeks. The only other batting
of moment transpired in the game between Fitzroy and
Essendon. Shea, of ’Roy, totalled 91 ; and Kortlang, of
the ’Dons, made 87 not out by.beautiful cricket. Bowlers
who earned bouquets were Teague, seven for 28 for P’ran
against St. Kilda; and Warne, six for 33 for Carlton
versus University.
* * * *
Ye ancient game of bowls has been paring
things very fine of late. In the Sydney Pennant final, on
Saturday, Chatswood (Syd.) wiped the green with Rand-
wick with only two points to spare, after a remarkably
even game right through. Chatswood led when the
score was 39-38; Rand wick was ahead at 59-57,
and at 78 it was level pegging. The bowlers grew apo-
plectic, and the strain was only relieved when Chatswood
ran out with 89 to 87. The “B ” Competition also fell
to a virtual end on Saturday, when Waverley I. and 11.
teams vanquished the opposition, and found it incum-
bent to play the Kilkenny Cat game to decide whose
should be the glory. But the sensation was the struggle
between N.S.W. Bowling Association and the Newcastle
crowd. After 25 heads had been played, darkness came
down like a curtain, with the scores at 138 all; and each
side escaped under cover of the night, taking half the
glory with it.
When is a race not a race? When it is a
hurdle-race. This is not a riddle, but a decision of the
Burra (S.A.) Jockey Club. It gave an event for “ horses
that have never won a stake value £5 at any registered
meeting”; and, when the winner was objected to as
having previously won over hurdles, it ruled that that
did not matter. This is all very well in England, where
Jockey Club and National Hunt Club are utterly distinct,
and no jumping event takes place at any flat-racing meet-
ing. But in Australia, where the two are mixed up every
day, it looks like plain foolishness.
•’ * * * *
J. de Rosier, the crack Yankee motor cyclist,
has just put up another fearsome record, by covering 84
miles 135 yards in an hour on the new wooden track at
’Frisco. This added 4 miles 355 yards to his previous best
hour’s run. Collier’s English record is only 68 miles 1380
yards. The difference is said to be largely due to the dif-
ference in climate, arid it is declared that de Rosier knows
be cannot equal his ’Frisco performance in England.
’Frisco certainly does seem to be a place where things all
happen over the odds. The significant item about de
Rosier’s run is that it is only five miles behind the
world’s record for a motor-car on a circular track, the
89 miles 892 yards put up by C. M. Smith at Brooklands
in Nov., 1909. After finishing his European tour, de
Rosier proposes to return home to Yankeeland via
Australia.
* *■ * *
Fred White, the Westralian cyclist who left
Fremantle on March 21 to break Birtles’s record from west
to east, had bad luck, and broke himself instead.
He had scheduled himself for 100 miles per day,
and thus expected to reach Sydney in 30-odd
days. Birtles’ time was 36 days 15 hours for
3350 miles. Near York, however, White smashed into a
hole and injured his knee. He remounted and pushed
on, in spite of the trouble the injury gave him, but, had
another fall and smashed his machine. That convinced
him this attempt was off, and he returned to Perth to
get patched up and have his machine repaired. But he
is coming again, so Birtles’ figures are still in jeopardy.
The world’s cycling championships meeting
takes place this vear in Italy on the 11th, 15th and 18th
June. Australia is likely to be represented by profes-
sional A. J. Clark and amateur E. V. Schneider.
It moves ! One of the great needs of the cyclist
is a lamp which will throw a really brilliant light while
travelling at a decent rate at nights. The want is now
filled bv a new electric lamp which has just been placed
on the'English market. It is attached to the front forks
and lit by a miniature magneto driven by fnetmn
from a small rubbered pulley actuated by contact with
the rim of the front wheel. As soon as speed is attained
a brilliant light streams out from the lamp, and as long
as speed is maintained the light lasts, and the faster the
speed the brighter the light. When the bike stops, out
o-oes the light; but that does not matter, as anj old lamp
does when one is travelling dead slow or not travelling
at all. , ,

Annual report of the Automobile Club of Vic-
toria shows that it is the largest in point of numbers
south of the equator. It has 580 members In 1904 it
had only 162: but in 1908 the figures bounded from 19-
to 399. Last year £lB4 was spent in defending members
in the courts. . *

“Dumhard “Sporting Notions” (B. 2/3/T1)
state that De Rosier, the crack Yankee motor-
cvclist, rides a 32-h.p. machine. De Rosier
rides an Indian, as stated ; but it is of 7 -h.p.
only, this being the largest size allowed 111 record-
making by the bodies governing international motor-
cycle racing. No motor-cycle may have a cylinder
volume of over 1000 cubic centimetres, which corres-
ponds to about 7 h.p. Some five years ago, in France,
racing on 20-h.p. and 30-h.p. machines was greatly in vogue,
and served one P useful purpose, viz. the manufacturers
learnt how to build very light and powerful engines,
which afterwards came in for aeroplanes. Also, many of
the prominent aviators rose from the ranks of the
dare-devil riders of these freaks. It may be news to
some readers that Glenn H. Curtiss, the . American flier,
covered a mile in 25 2-ssecs. on Florida Beach on a
40-h.p. eight-cylinder bike of his own make. lhis is the
greatest speed ever attained by a human being, aTlc *
probably only be equalled when someone falls out of a,n
aeroplane 11,000,000 ft, up. To return to earth and De
Rosier, he holds most of the world s records, from one
mile in 41 l-ssec. to 100 in 1 hour 15min. 24 „-ssec., and
in this writer’s opinion will beat all of the English riders
he meets at Brooklands, and very likely surpass his own
figures made on the American tracks.

At the St. Patrick's Day race-meeting at Port
Adelaide, the totalisator paid (in a field of 12) a dividend
of £5l 125., with £2 ss. as well to backers of the second.
There were only 20 people in that gootj thing. The kind of
distribution the public likes better came in the last race,
with a field of 14. First div., £l4 125.; second £lO 14s
Meanwhile, the tote “commission, which nobody had
missed, very nearly paid the stakes for the day. No
wonder S.A. can reduce owners’nomination and accept-
ance fees to the lowest limit.

A low-comedy contest was staged by the Mel-
bourne Athletic Club the other evening, when Ted
Whiting went into the ring to hit up that quaint abon-
ginality, Jerrv Jerome. Jerry is a lithe and limber coon,
made in Australia, whose most conspicuous gift is a
swallow-like aptitude for being elsewhere when his
opponent biffs the locality he recently occupied. This
happened throughout five rounds, and Mr. Jerome s brisk
dancing was vastly appreciated by a dense mass. How-
ever, there were moments when Whiting established
communication with Jerry, and then the black brother
got biffed most disgustingly in an apparently overloaded
bingey, with the result that J. Jerome sat down sud-
denly in the seventh visitation and complained of acute
trouble in his Little Mary. Whiting got the verdict, and
Jerry got hot fomentations. #
Talking of the “kidney punch,” with which
Tahmmy Burns appeared to make a fool of Bill Lang in
their Melbourne exhibition, Hugh D. Mclntosh has been
telling them in London : “ The punch has after-effects,
and I am strongly of opinion that any punch which has
harmful after-effects should be prohibited.” A Cockney
amateur authority on boxing puts it that “ if a man is
being punched in the kidneys he can get away unless he
is being’ held, when, of course, it is a clear Ctise of 3 foul.
But the effectiveness of Tahmmy’s blessed kidney punch
was said to be achieved through his Yankee art of keep-
ing the other fellow at close quarters. What are the
rules of boxing, anyhow?

“J. J.C.” (from Vancouver): I was last week in
Seattle, the latest home of Tahmmy Burns. Tahmmy is
still hard at work boosting himself and his doings. At
Vancouver he posed as a stout Canadian whose love for
the frosty Dominion is consuming; at Calgary, in
Alberta, he would live and die. In Sydney he told us
unfortunate wights that he was so fascinated by Aus-
tralia that he would live and die there, too. Meantime,
Tahmmy is a citizen of Seattle, with both eyes on the
dollars. . *

“King”: Back in 1909 The Bulletin parred
the performance of an ancient, alleged to be then 109,
who had just “kicked off” in a football match at
Waikanae. The B. had some doubt about the ancient.
There wasn’t need for any. The old chap was alive then,
and is still alive, and so is his 73-year-old son. He carried
the mails—on foot—between Wellington and Wanganui
in the '4o’s. f *
Germany is the happy hunting-ground of pro-
fessional cyclists. During the past season, on the 35
principal German tracks, there were 780 sprint races and
320 pace-following contests, which yielded a cash value
of £41,000. Fellows are not likely to leave that Tom
Tiddler’s ground to take part in a season in Australia,
where the game is dead.

England took a heavy revenge on France for
the Rugby beating that France had given Scotland. The
mi-ditv Failliot—6ft. lin., 14st. 51b., and very fast—was
away this time, and the Frenchmen went down, 37 points
to 0. _ .

Young Frank Brown, of Melbourne, who was
to have taken the boat for England this week, has
acquired tonsilitis in a severe form, and is under treat-
ment at a private hospital. It is now doubtful whether
he will take the trip at all, and almost certain that he
will not, in any case, be fit to represent Australia in the
120yds ’hurdles at the Coronation Games. Frank,
though still “young Frank,” is already a veteran in ex-
ploration. The Mount Maroomba field saw him ere
the “boom” arose on the reports of his party, who, by
the way, are not yet convinced that the place is no good.
More recently he was shooting buffaloes in the Northern
Territory, and he has a notebook stuffed with interest-
ing matter about his adventures.
George Gray’s offer to give Stevenson a start in
a long game, and beat him, represents the state of billiard
affairs in England, from veteran John Roberts’s point of
view. Whilst the sporting writers and some of the
alleged practical experts were trying to discount the
value of Gray’s play by attaching false importance
to his stipulation re chrystalate balls, old-man
Roberts smiled at the idea of the boy being unable
to adapt his stroke to ivory ball requirements.
As soon as he came to Australia last year Roberts was
keen on taking a hand in the business management of
George Gray. One of the Alcocks in Melbourne sug-
gested that perhaps the old champion would like to see
. y b f °u e ma , kln » an y business proposals. “ 1
of o l ee f K- I,U P ! a - V ' You sa J’ be can niake breaks
of 600 or 800 on this table. That’s good enough for me,”
said the past-master of the frame. Being assured tha.
Gray had already done so much he took it for granted
presently. yOU " g r " as ceruin to do bigger things

Ibe sensation of the Vic. Amateur Athletic
meeting was the splendid jumping of L. H. Kellv
(Wesley Gollegre), who skied over 6ft. Jin. of timber, and
thus shattered his Victorian record of 6ft. and the Aus-
tralasian record of 6ft. held by himself, Eric Russell
(Vic.) and A. H. Scott (N.S.W.). This is a mighty big
jump, but the world’s amateur record is 6ft. s§in.,
hoisted by M. F. Sweeney at N’Yark in 1895, while P.
Leahy cleared 6ft. s£in. in Ireland in 1898. The world’s
professional record is 6ft. sin., put up by M. A. Conrov
on the Warehousemen’s (now Albert) Ground on Boxing
Day, 1891.
The other day the Melbourne City Fathers
nearly did something hasty. They had called for
tenders for the supply of 2000 steel tram-plates
for a certain road, and were on the point of
accepting a British tender for £3380. Just, how-
ever, when they were on the verge of taking that
drastic action, someone remembered that there
was a German tender about £3OO or £4OO cheaper.
Then the Fathers paused, groaned and debated
whether, though it was good to talk at large about
preference to Britain, the virtue was worth prac-
tising at a cost of a few hundred pounds. No de-
cision was reached. Presumably, the city coun-
cillors had to hurry away to attend some meeting
at which they would make fervid remarks about
their devotion to “ the dear old Motherland.”
“ Torpedo ” : The manner of the arrival
of the Australian destroyers at Sydney wasn’t
calculated to stir up interest in Australian naval
matters —and it needs stirring so badly that no
chances ought to be thrown away. Port Jackson
offers more facilities for a popular welcome than
almost any other place in the world ; yet things
were so arranged as to prevent any public demon-
stration at all. The two destroyers crept through
the Heads at daybreak, and silently nosed their
way into Rusheutters Bay out of sight of every-
one. In the evening the crews were welcomed at
a shandygaff collection of side' shows ; but the
arrival of the national flag, flying for the first
time over an Australian warship, was practically
allowed to go unnoticed. Sydney might easily
have been stirred to do the occasion proud—as
Fremantle and Melbourne did. Why wasn’t it
given the chance ?
The “ Crown ” has once more been downed
in a tussle at Law over Wade's Gaming Act. A
country constable, one Trebilcock, summoned two
citizens, named (say) Ace and Deuce, for playing
an unlawful game, to wit dice. Before the country
beak, the policeman admitted that he could not
identify Ace, and withdrew the charge against
him, with apologies. The P.M. then dismissed
the case against Deuce, and, in turn, the Crown
applied for a mandamus against the P.M. for
allowing Deuce to escape. When the case came
before the higher court, the Judge asked the P.M.
what point of law was involved. His reply was
that he didn’t decide on any point of law, his de-
cision being based on mere horse-sense. The police-
man had charged Ace with playing with Deuce,
and Deuce with playing with Ace ; but, as he (the
policeman) could not recognise Ace as the man
who played with Deuce, how could Deuce be
found guilty of playing with Ace? The Judge
said, “ Just so,” and the Bar filled up time before
lunch making out its bills for costs against the
dented “ Crown.”
The Wowser party had no luck in its last
No-License campaign in N. S. Wales ; and it had
still less in a subsequent scrimmage in Justice
Pring’s Court. Bung’s special organ, F airplay,
got hold of a yarn that Mrs. Helen Barton, the
old Glasga campaigner who was a strenuous Cold
Tea barracker before the No-License poll, had put
a glass of brandy to the lips of a person who had
fainted. F airplay said the lady had remarked as
she did it, “ Talc this, ma deer ; ’tis poison, I ken
well, but ’twill dae ye guid, puir body.” The
lady who was supposed to have performed the
Good Samaritan act wanted £2OOO to heal the
wound ; and she probably chuckled when she
heard of Judge Pring’s reputation for severity.
But this time the judicial gun kicked
Shand, K.C.: If you had a child ill, and the doctor
ordered it brandy, would you give it brandy?—No.
You would rather let it die?—l would.
His Honor: If the doctor ordered you to give a child
spirit, you would not give it.
Plaintiff : No.
His Honor : Then, if it died, you would be guilty of
manslaughter.
After that, it wasn’t much use arguing with Jus-
tice Pring. The yarn being admittedly incorrect,
the jury found for plaintiff for £5. “Certificate
for costs V ” asked the lady’s counsel. “I have no
hesitation whatever in refusing it,” said the
Court. And £5 won’t go far in paying the
Samaritan’s K. 0., and the K.C.’s junior, and the
Gents One who instructed the K.C. and the
K.C.’s junior.

There is no task which a good motor-cycle can be reasonably
expected to do that the “ Triumph” will not do, and generally
do it better.
As a racer it has a fine record, as a utility machine for commercial
travellers and others it is unrivalled ; the engine is flexible,
durahle and compact, with few wearing parts ; and, though
but there is hardly a hill that a “ Triumph ” cannot
negotiate.

In the current month’s Australasian
Medical Gazette Dr. A. E. Finckh describes the
effects of “606” (otherwise known as Salvarsan)
on sufferers at the Coast Hospital. The famous
new drug was brought to Australia by Finekh a
couple of months ago. Its effects are magical.
Finckh is not the German his name suggests, but
an Australian native. He had a distinguished
career at Sydney University, specialises in patho-
logy and bacteriology, and has worked in all the
great Continental centres. Latterly he has been
associated with Professor Ehrlich, the discoverer
of the cure which threatens to wipe out one of the
grimmest diseases known to mankind.
F. S. Kelly, the pianist who is to give a
series of recitals in Sydney in July, is a genius
who at Eton and Oxford, and subsequently in
European musical circles, was hailed as a
Portent or Marvel. An amazing feature of
his career is his proficiency as an oarsman.
He stroked the Oxford eight to victory, and
won the Diamond Sculls in the fastest time on
record. There is something weirdly incongruous
about this virtuosity in Sport and Art alike.
What, for example, is the betting about a latter-
day Beethoven hooking the insufferable Johnson
from his present Tower of Arrogance? A million
to one, in all likelihood, and no takers.

A Woman’s
Success
in life is limited according to the
state of her health. No woman can
put forth her best efforts if, for instance,
she is continually troubled with headaches,
biliousness, depression of spirits, etc., which
arise through allowing constipation to go on
unchecked. Many women make the mistake
of neglecting this condition, with disastrous
results in later life. And yet it is so easy to
correct. One or two doses of
CALIFORNIA
SYRUP of FIGS
"Nature’s Pleasant Laxative”
are all that is needed to stimulate the organs,
cleanse the system and restore the body to a
perfect state of health. Thousands of women
take California Syrup of Figs, for it is the one
natural remedy that benefits the system without
weakening or straining in the slightest degree.

THE SHIP WRECK.
Steadily a good ship ploughed along
With the breath of the morning Breeze,
Thro’ Port Phillip Heads she cleared her way
To the opening rippling seas ;
During the night a storm prevailed,
Vivid lightning lit the sky,
The shrill winds shrieked, thunder pealed,
And the waves rose mountains high ;
Disaster befell the illfated ship
While the voyagers were hushed in sleep;
They were aroused to meet their piteous doom
On the wild and storm lashed deep ;
The yeasty breakers howled and foamed
As they dashed across the deck ;
Boats were launched but could not brave
The fierce waters around the wreck.
At break of day in search of prey
Carrion sharks swarmed round with glee,
Eager to feast upon the corpses grim
Flocked the reptiles of the sea.

But catch no honest man.
Arno : Fairly feeble. Judgment for ourselves, with costs

choose verse ?.... M.F.G. ; No .. J.B.C. : Hardly suffi-
cient interest Surfer: Poem threw up its feet and

ment—it wouldn’t be honest E.P. : Gracefully enough

sting in it, and is not likely to reform the place. One
bad egg aimed at the Town Council or the Mayor would
have drawn public attention to the fact that you had no
opinion of their city. Only a very agile mayor or town
council could dodge a well-aimed egg; whereas the
slowest and fattest institution or official can escape a sar-
castic poem by simply neglecting to read it... .Frosty:

, After the medical specialist firm of Free-
man and Wallace was broken up, mostly by post-
office restrictions, Howard Freeman, who ran the
business side of the huge advertising concern,
made a living by hanging on to the skirts of the
old trade. The Australian quack-medicine out-
look, however, got to look no better; so the
energetic Freeman, whose real name is Cohen, or
words to that effect, shipped back to the U.S. by
the Makura the other week.
“Ah Bah ! ” from the West: —
Foreign-owned Perth and Kalgoorlie Tramway Cos.,
two nearly-related concerns, ride roughshod overGroper-
dom. Recently the forriier got a bump in the shape of
an adverse Arbitration Court decision. It immediately
refused to supply a proper tram service, on the plea that
the expense was too great under the conditions imposed.
The Perth City Council has power to put matters right,
but refuses to act. Then the Kalgoorlie co., which had
contracted the habit of charging double fares on big
race-meeting days, was ordered by the local council to
stop the bad practice. It now threatens to imitate its
Perth, relation. The tram which carries men to and
from work on the mines—three miles, and sixpence each
way—runs right alongside a State-owned railway line ;
but the Groper Railway Department won’t run a train at
busy times for traffic, for fear of interfering with Private
Enterprise. Interfere with the way the State runs
things? Perish the thought!
A bit of old Maoriland :
The death of T. VV. McKenzie, one of the oldest iden-
tities of Wellington (M.L.), recalls the days when that
city (then known as Britannia) was mostly sea beach and
tattooed war-cries. With the carpenter of the ship Ade-
laide, McKenzie, then only about 14, was the first known
white person to sleep ashore on the present site. That
was on the night of March 8, or March 9, 1840, and
McKenzie got so close to Death on that occasion that he
smelt the mould on its whiskers. An empty whaiA
oelonging to a native chief having been selected as a
doss house, a couple of beds were made out of
fern and grass, the whites were just preparing to lie
down when the boss (Porutu) arrived with about 20 fol-
lowers, including two women. Porutu, as the subse-
quent proceedings showed, was considerably anno3’ed at
the invasion of his property, and promptly began a war
dance to the accompaniment of a tomahawk which
swung from his wrist. The strangers, although igno-
rant of the remarks addressed to them, were quite
satisfied that they couldn’t anyhow lie twisted into a
hearty welcome. The swish of the axe slicing past their
faces as they sat close together was a sharp hint of
trouble; and sure enough trouble was around. Only the
humanity and resource of one of Porutu’s women
stopped it. Springing forward she tore her mat off,
threw it over the paralysed whites, and bent her head
before the whirling savage to receive the final smash he
was about to deliver. Porutu halted the ironmongery in
mid-air, scowled at the woman as if Uncertain whether
to have her boiled with caper sauce or fried with chip
potatoes, and then strode from the hut. The daring
woman’s son thenceforward held McKenzie as his full
brother on the ground that the mother had given him
life just as surely as if she had given him birth.

ONCE-A=WEEK PIANO TALKS
Sometimes you will hear the questions asked, “ Why do Pianos cost so
much?’’and “Where is the great difference between cheap and expensive
Pianos ? ” .
Well, there are over ELEVEN THOUSAND separate parts in the
modern Piano, and the making and fitting of so many details of course runs
into a large amount of money. The difference between cheap and expensive
Pianos is made up in the care and precision with which the various items
are carried out.
Take, for instance, the “action,” which is the mechanism between the
/ : . ; ' • efk :
keys and the strings. In the action of smaller-sized Pianos there are over
five thousand parts, whilst in the mechanism of the larger Pianos there are
no fewer than seven thousand five hundred (7500) distinct pieces. The
building-up and regulating is a long and tedious work, requiring great care
in order to get everything to work just as it should. It must act neither
too much nor too little, so as to ensure a “touch” that is elastic, whilst
possessing that equal resistance which is so valued by good piano-players.
a ■} . • ; ( j
If you will just step into our Showrooms next time you are passing,
we shall be glad to show you the action of the BPWLE PIANOS.
We use the same type as is used in only the TWO VERY BEST
makes of IMPORTED Pianos. The touch is delightful—light, elastic,
and permits of the fastest repetition.

ANTINEURASTHIN
and Nervous BreaKdown.
In nervous breakdown the brain and nerve cells must be
FED, and not stimulated by medicines in the form of
tonics or sedatives, which (rive temporary relief, but can-
not effect permanent improvement.
L'Cithin is the ONLY substance by which the brain
and nerves can be nourished ; and it is Lecithin which
the system requires in all cases of neurasthenic condi-
tions. (Nervous Disorders, Dyspepsia, Neuralgia, Brain
Fag, Insomnia, Depression, Insanity, etc.) If the brain
and nerves can be supplied sufficiently with Lecithin the
cure is certain ; Antineurasthin supplies that substance
and effects the cure.
ANTINEURASTHIN is the ONLY known preparation
containing- an effective percentage of Lecithin in an
active organic state, completely assimilable, and with its
valuable principles undiminished in any way.
A sample of Antineurasthin, together with a valuable
treatise on Nervous Disorders, will be despatched by
return of mail by the Wholesale Distributor for Australia

Blood Burnt by Tobacco
Teeth, Byes, Nerves and Brain
Destroyed by Smoking I
German physicians declare in that deaths
amongst Germans between eighteen and
thirty-five yea rs of age, one lial f die from
nicotine or tobacco poison. They, unani-
mously declare that “ Tobacco burns out
the blood, teeth, et/es and brain."
Other great doctors declare nicotine to
be the poison of both heart and brain,
producing paralysis, apoplexy and
heart disease. Dr. Drysdale says •
"Nicotine enters the body by the lungs,
ruin of the nerves is complete.”
Men and youths who are slaves to
tobacco, wrecked in nerves and health
through continuous smoking, should take
“ Smokurb ” Tablets. They contain the
vital antidote for the poison, creating
nerve power, heart and brain strength.

STOMACH
AND
LIVER
TROUBLES
<72!
Nearly every woman has her " bad days ” —days when she is
tortured by splitting headaches, when she is irritable and nervous, or
bilious and dizzy, when she feels heavy and listless, or so dispirited
that only “ a good cry ” will save her from a breakdown. When-
ever you feel like that, be assured that your stomach, liver and
bowels are out of order. Headaches, bilious attacks, constipation,
nervousness, pains after eating, low spirits and sleeplessness are
only possible when there is some disorder of those digestive organs.
YIELD TO THE WORLD-FAMED TONIC
To restore your stomach to working order, and thus rid your-
self of all such troubles, take a few doses of Mother Seigel’s Syrup
daily, after meals, and you will soon be a different woman. This
herbal tonic has no equal in the world as a sure and swift stomach
and liver tonic. It is incomparably the best friend a woman can
have at every season of life. Try it to-day !
Mrs. McGrath, 205, Berkley Street, Carlton, Victoria, says :—" I became
subject to indigestion. My worst troubles were feelings of suffocation and
oppression at my chest, and sharp pain in the back. After eating, I often
felt as though I would vomit. A doctor said I had chronic indigestion, and
he feared I would never get rid of it. Pills and medicines did me no good.
Then my mother persuaded me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I took it for
some weeks and the result was a complete and perfect cure 1 ” —April 30,1910.

“Corporal Bung : ” The- curse of cooky cl om is
bills. Cocky buys almost everything on bills, and pays
once a year. I started a staff-of-life producery in aeocliy
village once. Did great biz for three mouths. The flour-
man then thought it was about time he got a divy.
Wearing my best sorry-to-trouble-you expression, I visited
my customers. Results : (1) Unanimous verdict that I
was the best dough-puncher w ho Was everin that district.
(2) Unanimity again—“Of course you know we always
pay our accounts after harvest.” (3) Bad language,
which blistered the goodwill of the biz (4) Theflourman
took charge. (5) Me on scratch again, seeking a place
wherein the cocky was not.
“Uclcle”: This is a true bill. A youngster
came into the store the other day and asked for some
“sallyhot” collars. He had all the hands beaten.
“Garn, yer mugs!” he said. “I want them sort you
spit on to clean!” The draper at once handed out a

“ Lin There was a recent death on the staff
of one of the biggest of Australian concerns. After
nearly 30 years’ service, and over 20 years’ compulsory
contribution of 2£ per cent, of the annual salary, the
benefits accruing to the needy female dependents of the
deceased clerk are summed up in one little word—nil.
It is up to the Australian Government to make an investi-
gation of all private superannuation funds, to ascertain
both their soundness and the value of the benefits com-
pared with the contributions. Either that, or compel
every employer who deducts any amount from an em-
ployee’s wages to pay it into a Commonwealth office for
subsequent distribution. I know some employers are
honest. No doubt a few of them know something about
actuarial science as well; but not many.

“Petifi”: May I switch record-controversial-
ists on to a fresh track ? What’s the record for “jump-
ing the rattler ” ? I notice that the Victorian Railway
Commissioners lately got £4 9s. 6d. “ conscience money ”
from a jumper (1 suppress with scorn any comment on
his unprofessional conduct in thus “spirting up” after
all) who reckons he once did the return trip from
Melbourne to Sydney and back on the nod. Can any of
my leaping brethren beat that? Personally, my longest
jump was from Sydney to Albury, where 1 found thegaol
fairly comfortable as gaols go.

One of Victoria’s Rich Landlords visited Maori-
land lately and was hugely impressed with the
Dominion’s method of making prison-labor profit-
able. The land of lou Ward Sets a good many of
its first offenders to tree-planting. Poor land is
cleared of scrub and useless timber and planted with
pinus insignia. Each prisoner plants some 160 trees
per day; presuming it takes as long to clear the
ground as to plant, this means that each man plants
about 24,000 trees a year, each of which should be
worth 30s. at the end of 20 years. It looks a long
time to wait; but the results are worth waiting for.
In 20 years the crop that one man can plant in a
year should be worth £36,000 ; and even if three-
fourths of this were wasted or lost in some way,
there would still be a mighty dividend for the State
to collect.

We are the women and children

Mainshaft and winze and crosscut—

Look at us 1 Gaze in our faces !•
God ! Are you not ashamed
In the eyes of your godless fellows
Of the men ye have killed and maimed
They moiled like gnomes in the faces,
They choked in the fracteur fumes,
And your dividends paved the pathways
Th.it led to their early tombs.
With Death in the sleepless night shifts
They diced for the prize you drew ;
And the Devil loaded the pieces—
But the stakes were held by you 1
You were the lords of Labor;
They were the slaves of Need.
Homes had they for the keeping,
Children to clothe and feed !
You paid them currency wages—
Shall it stand to your souls for shrift
That ye bought them in open market
For seven-and-six per shift ?
Wise in your generation,
Cunning are you in your day 1
But 'ware of the stealthy vengeance
That never your wealth shall stay !
They won it—yea, with their lifeblood ;
You laughed at the sacrifice ;
But by every drop of your spilling
We shall hold you to pay the price !
You have sown the wind, to your sorrow ;
You have sown by the coward’s code,
Where the glimmering candles gutter
And the rock-drill bites on the lode !
You have sown to the jangle of stampers,
And the brawl of the Stock Exchange,
And your children shall reap the whirlwind
On the terms that the gods arrange.
And you, who council the nation,
Statesmen who rule the State 1
Foolish are ye in your weakness,
Wise are we in our hate !
Traitors and false that pander
To the spillers of human life, •
Slaying with swords of silence
Who dared not si iy with the knife !
And you of the House of Pilate,
You who gibber of Christ
At the foot of the golden crosses
Where the sons of men are triced 1
Yon who whimper of patience,
Who slay with a loose-lipped lie
At the word of the fat blasphemers
Whose poppet-heads mock the sky 1
We are the women and children
Of the men that you mowed like wheat.
Some of us slave for a pittance—
Some of us walk the street!
Bodies and souls, ye have scourged us;
Ye have winnowed us flesh from hone.
But, by the God ye have flouted,
We'll come again to our own !

MEDLOW BATH, Blue Mountains, N.S.W.
MAJESTIC HOTEL.
COMPLETE arrangements have been made by the new proprietor (Mr. W. H. Burgess), late of the Grand
Hotel, Melbourne, for the comfort of visitors during the forthcoming season.
Medlow Bath is an ideal resort. The crisp mountain air is a delight, and the mountains, in their
Spring garb, appeal to lovers of the picturesque. Arrangements can be made at the Hotel for motors,
carriages and riding tours.
Motor parties can be arranged any time to start from the City Office —or your own residence—direct

THE CASE IS CLEAR.
The case is clear. On the one hand we have fountain pens that
splutter and leak—fountain pens that cannot be filled without a
bulb filler—that are in a word not themselves without this old-
fashioned friend, the filler. But in my hand here I have an
Onoto Pen —that cannot leak and that fills itself. A pen a child
can use—a pen no wise man would be without.
—You, sir, should own an Onoto Pen, it cannot leak.
—lt fills itself, it never splutters or scratches.
And it is British made. Now, is 12/** too much to pay for such a pen—
or a little more for the new G model. All s'ationers, jewellers and stores
sell it. Go to-day, while the evidence is fresh in your mind—to the nearest
stationer’s and say—“ An Onoto Pen, please.”
Booklet about the Onoto Pen free on application to Thos. Db La Rue

sentative, Norman Baker, 50 York Street, Sydney.

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT A
‘SMOKE’ IS TILL YOU’VE
TRIED MY CIGARS
6Ut/Y\.
I’M going to have my Cigars smoked over every
part of Australasia—and the most confirmed
pipe-smokers are going to be the biggest
smokers of my Cigars, too.
Talk about joy! Why, to sit round a camp
fire, over a billy of tea, pitching to your mates,
each of you smoking one of my Cigars, joy isn't
in it! It’s just simply bliss!
As the yarns go round, the blue smoke
curling upwards in a fragrant cloud, the
smooth cool Havana flavor lingering on your
lips—l tell you, you’ll spend some of the
happiest hours of your life.
sdf
Letters are coming in to
me in shoals from all over
Australasia, praising up my
Cigars. Take one I’ve just
got as I write this, for in-
stance—it's from a chap on a
cattle station up in Northern
Queensland. He writes:—,
“Those DIADEMAS Cigars
ofyoursare just alright. I’ve
always smoked a pipe—but
no more. Not that I’ve given,
up pipe-smoking altogether;
but when I want a real smoke
—something rich—l light up
one of your DIADEMAS,
and give myself up to its
pure enjoyment.”
To make you acquainted
with my Cigars, and prove
their value, I make you this
FREE OFFER of
5 or 6 CIGARS
you may select.
Send for 100 of any of
Remit the amount, and
I will deliver promptly,
postage or carriage paid,
to any address in Aus-
tralia.
Smoke 5 op 6 of them, and if they're
not superior to most Cigars at double the
price, send the remainder back to me, and
I’ll return every penny of your money —no
charge made for the Cigars you’ve smoked.
My Cigars are made from the very finest
mild, rich mellow Tobacco, the filling or inside
heart of the cigar being all straight long
leaf. The Cigars are hand-made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before
it goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed
to burn freely and draw easily.
There s no “ catch” about this offer—it's just
plain and honest. To prove it, you can refer
as to my financial position and way of doing
business to the Manager of the Commercial Bank
of Australia, Collins Street, Melbourne. _ He’ll
vouch for me.
Send down for a box to-day—once you smoke
them you 11 make it a habit, and buy regularly
from me. When ordering, say whether you
like light, medium, or dark colors.

Australian-raised ostriches will soon be
making money for their owners in Bananaland.
Squatter Behan, of Garfield station, near Jericho
(Q.), who imported the first pair into Queensland
four years ago, isn’t keeping the business to him-
self, but is sending the local article to people in
different parts of the State. The first pair
despatched were sent to Crow’s Nest, near
Toowoomba.
Poor old Australia, it seems, can’t make a
dredge—a mere scoop for ladling up muck and
things. True, with machines which some people
think are dredges it has been doing the cheapest
gold-recovery work in the world, and that might
seem to suggest that the machines are effective;
but evidently the Queensland Government hasn’t
heard of that. Anyway, it has just placed an
order in Germany for a mechanical muck-ladle.
Some alleged “good Australians” think this
country ought to be very well satisfied if it is
allowed to supply the muck.
“ Willie Tell ” : Premier Denham boasted
the other day that his Government was carrying
out the whole of the Rockhampton programme of
1907. If that be so, will Premier Denham kindly
explain why he has dropped all mention of the
Trades Disputes Bill, and why State Insurance
has been buried 10,000 fathoms deep by the
present Government ? Both these items loomed
large in the Rockhampton programme. Perhaps
the fact that one of Denham’s leading supporters
is a director of a big insurance office explains the
funeral of State Insurance ; but even that circum-
stance won’t wipe it off the programme.
The Atherton paper revives an old yarn
about a passenger and a hat, and alleges that the
thing actually happened the other day on the Her-
berton line, near Tolga. The passenger’s hat blew
off. The passenger jumped out, pursued the lost
Cady, caught it, and sprang into the last carriage.
After resting a bit, the sprinter got out again, ran
along the train, and finally got bac.k into the car-
riage he had jumped out of. No doubt, this is
why the Brisbane Courier and other papers are
so terribly afraid of the railways passing out of
State into Federal control. They don’t want pas-
sengers to lose their present facilities for recover-
ing their hats.
“C.S.A.”: Toowong, the place where
Brisbane politicians and other people of conse-
quence go when they are thoroughly dead, is the
most inviting looking spot around Brisbane. The
northern capital’s apathy regarding a sewerage
system, the absence of effort to cope with the
lung-wracking dust nuisance, and the disinclina-
tion to declare war against the mosquitoes, which
admittedly are the prime cause of the dengue epi-
demic, all go to make Toowong very popular.
After sizing up the city and comparing it and the
other suburbs with Toowong, I can quite under-
stand a corpse getting up on its elbow and saying
triumphantly: “Pooh! I wouldn’t be found alive
in Brisbane !”
“ Stan ” : When the block on the line
from Cairns to the hinterland was cleared, every
available item of rolling stock was commandeered
into service. The first train through carried a
great show of beer. Evidently, it was expected
that the relief of the back country would be ,
mafficked to some extent. During the block
beer had a habit of petering out, and Bung had an
anxious time between the supplier at Cairns,
Townsville or Brisbane, who was anxious to fill
orders, but couldn’t get the stuff through, and
the Railway Department, which wouldn’t give
Bung preference. One well-known Bung in the
metal region, who had just sent his order, hearing
a.rumor that W. Kidston had passed out politi-
cally, dashed to the telegraph office and wired,
“If Kidston retires, increase order five hogs-
heads.” An all-round sprat-catcher is Bung. Joy
and calamity alike increase the flow to his cash-
register.
A return has just been issued by the Q.
Railway Department showing that, since the day-
labor system was introduced in 1900, it has saved
the State £271,000. A comparison with probable
cost by contract shows an actual saving of nearly
13 per cent., says the official document. In the
face of this kind of evidence, supplied by its own
officers, why is the Queensland Government
fiddling about with a loose notion of again trying
the contract system ?
“ Politicus ” in defence :
Crawford, M.L.A., cudgelled in (B. 9/3/’ll), is neither
more nor less a backslider than any other member of the
Labor party. He holds it to be his duty to respect the
Referendum result as a Labor politician, and to keep his
pledge as a man. Other Labor members, who respected
neither the voice of the people nor their own signed pro-
mise, go scot-free. If, as alleged, one section of the
Labor party, by its vote, violated the plank “ Secular
Education,” then the other section completely abjured
the great democratic principle of the Referendum.
But, as a matter of fact, one can believe thor-
oughly in the Referendum without being pre-
pared to submit every thing to it. Sectarianism
is one of the things that Labor has to shut out;
and the party doesn’t go back on its belief in the
Referendum by opposing a scheme which would
bring that sectarian issue forward.
A CHEERLESS PROSPECT.

An old Toowoomba land mark has gone—
not a pub this time, but a church for a change.
This is the old wooden tabernacle of St. Luke,
built in 1856 by the Rev. Benjamin (afterwards
Canon) Glennie, the pioneer Anglican parson on
the Downs.
A lurid light on the early methods of deal-
ing with our black brother is thrown by the
following beautiful extract from the Brisbane
Courier of March 13, 1861, lately reprinted in
that journal:—
Advertisement. —“To the officer in command of the
party of native police who shot and wounded blacks on
Manumbar station on Sunday, February 10. Sir, —If in
future you should take a fancy to bring- your troopers
on a sporting excursion to Manumbar, we shall feel
obliged if you will either bag or bury the game which you
shoot, as it is far from pleasant to us to have
the decomposing remains of four or five blaekfellows
lying unburied within a mile of our head station.
If you will do neither, please be kind enough to
remove the corpses from the waterholes near the head
station, as we sometimes use the water for culinary pur-
poses. As most of the blacks you left dead on our run
were feeble old men —some apparently not less than 80
years of age—will you kindly inform us whether these
hoary sinners are the parties engaged in spearing bullocks,
or whether you just shoot them because the young ones
are too nimble for you? You have also wounded two
of our station blacks who have been in our employment
for the last eight or nine years, and we have never known
either of them to be charged with a crime of any kind.—
T. and A. Mortimer, Manumbar, Feb. 22,1861.”
In Defiance!

I BEG no grace, ye gods of Fate,
So take away the gifts ye gave !

I raised myself, with native power,
To loftier heights and clearer day ;

I need you not. Your dole I spurn.
I hold but what my hand hath won.
To me the thing I truly earn
Is more than all beneath the sun.
Ido not beg. With lifted head
And flashing brand—not yours, but mine—
I stride where storms awake the dead,
And blazing stars of Judgment shine.

Whose soul with courage ever new,
Beneath your scowl can live elate,
And laugh at Time and Death and You !
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. March 25, 1911.
Mr Dear Thargomindah,—
The rain still raineth, and with us an adaptable
india-rubber suit would have better chances than
the harem skirt. Nevertheless, the harem gar-
ment had an outbreak in this city on Friday,
when a pretty girl and somebody else’s brother
took the pavement by storm. The mode], a quiet
creation of navy serge and black mohair braiding,
was really inconspicuous; but a crowd of males—
many of them well known in silver-tailed circles—
waited for the reappearance of the nine-days’
wonder when it passed into a shop. Don’t tell
me that woman has lost her charm for the lords
of creation ! Why, let her but step out of that
gentle dowdiness into which it is the aim of most
husbands to relegate their wives, and he is as a
boy that beholds a circus for the first time. As
for the other women, they merely looked and ap-
proved or scoffed, as the fancy took them. The men
cackled like so many geese.
A tea party that escaped the prevailing deluge
was hostessed by Miss Amy Mills last Tuesday,
when the tall hedges around the pretty lawn at
Egham sheltered a heap of folk, small tables and
superfine fodder. The musical attractions were
looked after by Miss Mills herself, Percy Brier,
and Florence Micheli, three young persons who
can make music with a capital M.
On the same afternoon the mistress of the Macgre-
gor household opened the new ward at the Lady
Bowen Hospital, which the prevailing fashion in
babies has rendered most necessary. Her Ex’s
motherly inquiries into the wellbeing of patients
and the working of the establishment were in sharp
contrast to the shuddering aversion of another
vice-regal lady when she passed through the
wards labelled (abominably) “Single.” Mayor
and Mayoress Diddams lent their aid, and then
dropped in at the Mills’s “ afternoon.”
Other teas have had for their central ornament
Miss Greta Baynes, whose wedding next month is
exciting remark. Sister Edwards was one of the
party-givers, and the Mactaggart girls also
gathered in a good following to wish the bride-to-
be phenomenal luck.
The arrangements are now completed for the
send-off to Mrs; Cecil Palmer, and ere this gets
inside its pink wrapper the cheerful lady, who is
leaving for the Big Fog, will have acquired an-
other bauble to remind her of antipodean friends.
Death has robbed us of the Grand Old Man of
the Queensland railways, James Forsyth Thalion,
who for 50 years has had the hiss of steam and the
rattle of the iron road in his ears. A grim old
person he was, but with a vagrant twinkle in his
e ye and the twinkle told more of liis real nature
than the grimness. Since his arrival here
in 1882 he has seen the rails stretch from
a few hundreds to nearly 4000 mile?. He has
vetoed a score of lines for every one he has
approved, and most of those he favoted are paying
excellent dividends to the State. Something like
three years ago he took a “holiday,” going to the
northern end of the world, where he worked
rather harder than usual hunting for new ideas.
On the eve of his leaving, the public and the railway-
men presented him with many proofs of their re-
gard. On Sunday last they lined the street bare-
headed, in silent token of their unabated liking
and their respect for a courage and a rare gift of
handling men.
On Thursday another well-known figure came
to the crossing—“ Did ” Harris, son of the late
George Harris, a popular man among business
folk, once a fine shot, and always a racing patron.
In the palmy days he was regarded as a catch,
for Harris the elder was thought likely to cut up
well; but the big burst sent him to his grave a
ruined man, and the family h is lived quietly for
years. His sisters, Mrs. Luinlev Hill (formerly
Mrs. Taylor, of Bellevue) and Mrs. R. G. Casey,
are well known in local and Victorian society ;
and he claimed pretty Evelyn Thorn, brother
Percy, and Captain Rome as cousins.
A North Queensland nightingale is to go south
to pour her notes into Melba’s ear as soon as the
owner of the ear arrives. The Dowager-Countess
Dudley was interested in the girl, Gladys Mon-
crieff, and she arranged the introduction. Miss
Moncrieff is a Bundaberg native, but for some
years past her voice has been heard chiefly in
Townsville and Charters Towers; and in the
Eisteddfods of those parts she has gathered a
harvest of laurels. Her voice is a soprano.
The soft-voiced Hawaiins are nightly . filling
His Majesty’s Theatre with song, dance and pay-
ing guests. It is a cheerful little party, which
gives a quaint and cheerful little show. Its mani-
pulation of the music-bearing ukulele, a species
of baby-guitar, makes the company worth while,
even if it couldn’t either sing or dance ; and it can
do both.
The Hula Dance, which Miss Anehila con-
tributes, is a remarkably effective piece of wrig-
gling. She may not be much at the two-step, .but
on her public form she could squirm out of the
closest legal net that ever a K.C. set. Brisbane,
being largely addicted to the shuffling habit, gets
it right home every time, and Miss Anehila brings
down the house with as much clatter as Samson
of old.
Mr. and Mrs. T. M. Hal 1 came back to us last
week from a southern holiday, spent by the head
of the house in recruiting after an attack of
dengue. -
Miss Aileen O’Dwyer, the recent see. of the
now defunct Pioneer Club, was married to Cap-
tain Geo. Burrows on Friday. The groom is an
ex-army man, who has people “at ’ome.” The
newly-weds go north.
There is a mushroom-like growth of wigwam
(please pronounce it “ wiggiam”) on the turf at
the Exhibition Grounds, with sundry Red Indians
within. Their dress, particularly the smile which
forms an important portion of it, and the mag-
nificent furred skins east across their persons, are
just lovely ; but the air which haunts the inner
household shrines has a strength to which even
Brisbane is unaccustomed. Last Friday the
management entertained a large party of inter-
ested persons on the ground, and the braves split
the air with their war whoops, so that visions of
their playful method of inserting pine splinters
under the skin and igniting the same came back
with painful vividness.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
In 1908 there were 340 electors on the
roll for the Condamine division of the Queensland
State electorate of Murilla; there are now 1038,
the increase being almost wholly due to the influx
of settlers from Victoria and N.S.W. —squeezed
out from those States mostly by the terrific prices
demanded there for land.


Comstock’s “ Dead Shot” Worm Pellets.
4 Safe Sure and Reliable Remedy for the
Eradication of Worms in Children
and Adults.
Worms by their movements, and the intenup-
tion they offer to the contents of the bowels,
generally occasion pain or uneasiness in the abdo-
men sometimes spasmodic, sometimes gnawing or
bitin* and not infrequently of a vague, indescrib-
able character, and yet very distressing. Sympa-
thetic with this is a sensation of itching at the
anus and at the nostrils, producing a disposition
to scratch the fundament and pick the nose,
which is characteristic of this affection. The
bowels are often disordered, sometimes consti-
pated or stopped, and sometimes relaxed with
occasional bloody discharges, as in dysentery. The
discharge is sometimes in shreds or flakes, which
are not infrequently mistaken for fragments of
partially-digested food. It is not uncommon for
portions of undigested food to pass with the dis-
charges. The appetite is exceedingly variable; in
some cases natural, in others deficient, craving
or depraved; one condition not infrequently
alternating with another. The abdomen is often
hard, swollen and tympanetic, the breath heavy
or foetid, and tongue furred, with disagreeable
taste, and a copious flow of saliva ; swelling of the
upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils, and disposition
to grind the teeth during sleep are other charac-
teristic symptoms. The effects, however, often
extend beyond the alimentary canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced inconse-
quence either of the direct irritation of the worms
or of the disordered digestion which they occa-
sion. Among the most common of these are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irritation
of temper, wakefulness, or disposition to exces-
sive sleep, disturbed sleep, sudden starting out of
sleep, as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic
movements of the eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deafness.
General convulsions are not infrequent in chil-
dren, and symptons strongly resembling “Water
on the Brain” have been ascribed to worms and
have ceased on their expulsion.
Cases of St. Vitus’ dance, melancholia and ner-
vous diseases, and even insanity have been attri-
buted, with the most apparent reason, to the
same cause. In addition to these affections may
be mentioned obstinate cough, spasm of the
glottis, palpitation, languid circulation, pale and
yellowish skin, sunken eyes, a livid circle about
the eyelids, and a general emaciation. This con-
dition is often accompanied by fever, and is then
called worm fever. Persons in apparently perfect
health may be afflicted with worms, and the only
symptoms may be periods of irritableness or a
constant desire for something to eat, which may
last for months until the system breaks down, and
the worms manifest their presence in some other
manner.
Worms have frequently heen described by
medical men as “The Children’s Enemy.” Un-
doubtedly there is no greater enemy to health,
happiness and comfort of children thap the
presence of worms in the stomach and Intes-
tines; causing an indescribable irritation and
gnawing in the bowels, which upsets its victim,
impairs the health, spoils the temper, and drives
the mother to distraction, and earns for the little
innocent the harsh and undeserved reputation of
being “a cross child.”
Unfortunately many mothers fail to recognise
the fact that their little ones are suffering intense
pain and distress, and are practically irresponsible
for the outbursts of temper, restlessness and
peevishness, and until some more serious symp-
toms appear nothing is done to alleviate the dis-
tress. The symptoms of this disease are some-
what variable, but generally they are so charac-
teristic that no mother need have any doubts.
The best proof of worms is worms, and if the
general conduct of the child is such as to give the
slightest suspicion, an examination of the stools
(evacuation from the bowels) will afford ample
proof.
A child who is affected with Thread Worms
will often appear to the eye to be in an indifferent
state of health. It becomes peevish and irritable
in its temper, and complains of itching of the nose,
whilst the same symptom may be very prominent
indeed in the lower part of the bowel. Another
point to which the attention of mothers should be
specially directed is that the child is apt to start
in its sleep, its repose being in this way of a dis-
turbed nature. Note also that many children who
are in the habit of wetting their beds do so by
reason of the irritation which these worms produce
in the body, the irritation extending to the bladder
and causing it involuntarily to part with its
contents.
In every heap of decaying matter there is al-
ways to be found a nest of worms. They breed
and multiply in impure matter. And so it is in
the human system. The accumulation of partially
digested food in the intestines, which becomes
putrid when the bowels are constipated, induces
the presence of worms. A few doses of Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, followed by a dose
or two of Dr. Morse’s Indian Boot Pills, will dis-
turb them in their nest and drive them out of the
system.
Pin Worm, Thread Worm, or Seat Worm.
Is an Inhabitant of the Lower Bower.
The Long Thread Worm measures from one
inch to two inches in length, the upper portion
being thin, and the lower two-thirds about twice
as thick. This variety also infests the large
intestines and the rectum.
The common Thread Worm derives its name
from its thread-like appearance. The average
length is about one-third of an inch, this descrip-
tion applying to the female worm. The male
worms are much smaller, and do not exhibit
half the length of the females. The favorite situ-
ation of the Thread Worm is the large bowel
which forms the terminal portion of the intestines.
These worms cause severe itching at the lower
passage and picking at the nose. Anasmia, rest-
lessness, irritability and loss of appetite are also
frequent symptoms. A child or adult so affected
can find no relief from the terrible itching, and
consequently becomes restless and upset at the
slightest provocation. A purgative medicine will
sometimes afford temporary relief by the expulsion
of some of the Worms congregated near the
rectum ; but the Worms multiply so quickly that
the trouble returns. To get rid of the Worms and
their eggs, their nests also must be removed, and
that requires a specific remedy. Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are unfailing in
their results.
Hound, or Stomach Worms.
The Round Worm in its appearance, save in
color of course, somewhat resembles the earth-worm
in shape. As in the case of the Thread Worms,
the female worm very much exceeds the male
worm in size. Whilst the Thread Worm inhabits
the large intestine of children, the Round Worm
is found in the small bowel, or that portion of the
intestine which immediately comes off from the
stomach and makes up the succeeding 20ft. in
length of the digestive tube. Adults, of course,
are frequently also affected with Round Worms,
and it may be added that they are also subject
to be troubled with Thread Worms. The danger
of the Round Worm appears to be that in some
cases the parasite has the habit of making its way
through the walls of the intestine. Occasionally
it will pass into the stomach from the bowel itself,
and it has also been known to cause liver troubles,
when one of these parasites has contrived to pass
from the bowel into the duct or tube which leads
the bile from the liver into the intestine.
If the worm penetrates from the bowel into the
general cavity of the belly, inflammation of a fatal
kind may be set up. The symptoms are very
much like those produced by the presence of the
’Thread Worm. In addition, however, a good
deal of thirst represented in patients, along with
a disturbance of sleep, with a debased appetite,
the patient developing a liking for all sorts of
strange and unwonted foods. Itching of the
nose may also be here a prominent symptom.
All Traces of Worms Eradicated.
Mrs. H. Campbell, Corbett Street, West End,
Brisbane, Queensland, writes: “My little girl,
aged five years, suffered from thread worms for
some months. I took her to the doctor, who pre-
scribed a syrup, but found it did not do much
good, as the symptoms still remained. I saw
Comstock’s ‘ Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets advertised,
and procured a packet, which proved very effec-
tual. They greatly relieved her and she immedi-
ately seemed to lose all trace of the trouble. The
dry cough and the restlessness at night and other
symptoftis left her, and she is now in splendid
health. You may use this, if you wish, as a testi-
monial.”
Thread Worms in a Child, also Adult.
“My little girl, aged seven years,” writes Mrs.
A. Brisfow, of 37 Regent-street, Sydney, “was
subject to Thread Worms, which caused her to be
peevish, irritable and restless at night, with a
voracious appetite, and I procured all sorts of
remedies for, her, but without avail, until I saw
Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets adver-
tised, and my husband told me to buy them. I
did so ; and after she had taken one box and a
part of the second, all traces were eradicated,
having passed great numbers of them. Since then
a friend of mine who had suffered also from
Thread Worms for 20 years, enduring much dis-
comfort, rendering her pale, sallow and thin, and
which caused her much internal trouble with a
feeling of sickness, during this time using all sorts
of remedies such as turpentine and different Worm
Powders to remove them, without avail. At
length she was induced to try Comstock’s ‘Dead
Shot’ Worm Pellets, and after taking the third
box (following the directions minutely) she was
pleased to find that the worms not only ceased to
trouble, but that all trace of them had left her,
that her health was returning, she was increasing
in weight and getting a better color. She cannot
speak too highly of them, and recommends them
to all whose children are suffering in this way.”
Child Alive with Worms.
Completely Relieved after Many So-called
Remedies Fail.
Mrs. M. Johnson, 135 Elizabeth-street, Wel-
lington, N.Z., writes : “Permit me to express my
grateful appreciation of the value of Comstock’s
‘ Dead Shot ’ Worm Pellets. My little girl, aged
three years, was very bad, continually picking her
nose, jumping about in her sleep at nights, and
she was afraid of being left alone, night or day.
My husband, after bringing home several different
so-called remedies and ‘ certain cures,’ all of no
earthly good, decided to give Comstock’s ‘ Dead
Shot ’ Worm Pellets a fair trial. I smiled when I
saw what he had, as I was sick and tired of trying
to cure the poor child. After taking the first
dose the result was marvellous; she must have
been simply alive with worms. I continued the
treatment, giving her a pellet in the morning and
a teaspoonful of castor oil at night, and I am
pleased to say that she is thoroughly cured, and
has had no return of the symptoms.”
Stomach and Thread Worms Expelled.
Mrs. Willmott, of Cooma, N.S.W., states :
“Hearing about the wonderful success of your
Worm Pellets, I decided to give them a trial. I
gave my three childnm, Roy, Phyllis and Horace
a dose each, as they had all the symptoms of
Worms. The pellets were taken at 6 o’clock in
the morning, and at 10 o’clock Roy had passed a
Stomach Worm about 12 inches in length, and
the other children passed quite a number of Thread
Worms. Since taking the pellets the children
seemed greatly relieved, and appear to be better
in health. I shall always recommend them to my
friends, and you may use this testimony for publi-
cation in any way you please.”
The Use of Purgatives.
Although the use of medicines which are simply
purgatives may cause the discharge of some small
worms, such medicines are useless to thoroughly
eradicate the pest. Physics which do not kill the
worms and their eggs have no permanent results,
as the worms pass through the matter in the
intestines and reach the upper portion of the
bowels or the stomach, or fasten themselves to
the membranes of the intestines until the effect of
the purgative is over. Worms require a specific
medicine, and there is no remedy so effective as
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets. They
kill the worms, destroy their eggs and dislodge
their nests.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are a
scientific preparation, prepared in the form of a
sweet that children eagerly take. They are
packed in glass tubes with full directions in each
and are for sale by chemists and stores generally at
2s. 9d. per packet, or six packets for 15s. ; and if
unable to obtain locally, will be mailed post free
on receipt of price. Prepared only by The W.
H. Comstock Co., Ltd., 23 Lang-street. Sydney,

Suffered for Months with
Disordered Kidneys.
“ Every time I moved a. pain shot through my body.**

have done me, which is wonderful,” writes Mrs. A. Petterson, John Street, Kangaroo Point, Bris-
bane, Q. “ I suffered for some months with diseased kidneys and stoppage of water. I was so laid
at times that I ready could not get about. The pain in my back was unbearable. Every time 1
moved a pain shot through my body. I was so bad that I thought my trouble would turn to Bright s
Disease. My appetite was completely gone, and I was always ailing and so weak that I could not
attend to my household duties. I tried many different remedies, but nothing.seemed to give me any
relief whatever. Luckily for me I happened to be talking to a lady who recommended Dr. Sheldon s
Gin Pills, which I got immediately. After taking them for a reasonable time, the pain from which
I suffered speedily left me. They had the effect of removing the gravel. I am completely cured,
and can do my work as formerly.”
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills act directly upon the Kidneys, cleansing these organs,
and the blood, of uric acid, which is the cause of Rheumatism, Backache, Lumbago
and similar distressing pain. They are effecting many most remarkable cures.
All who suffer from these complaints should give Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills a trial,
and they will be quickly cured. Prices Is. 6d. and 2s. 6d.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM the dining-room window, on the
eighth storey of the press club, I
looked odt oh the lower end of the
newspaper city, howling and roaring with
waggons and rotary presses, and out to
Brooklyn Bridge, like a blue spiders w
in the river haze. At a fine place like Glon-
curry, for instance, or Lawlers, or Patsy
Springs, the stars shine clearly on the salt-
bush; here the firmament shows no light,
because the electrics blur what stars there
are Instead, there is the sparkle of the
current on the overhead wires of the tram-
I:”s cUing the river. It « such contrast-
iug memories and impressions that make
the lust for Australia insistent.
At a restaurant in Fulton-street there
had been six of us Australians that day
one artist, one electrician, three architects
and myself —a man who uses ink. ,
The architects are duly qualified, but they
want degrees, and will not see Australia lot,
two years yet. In the summer they woi
as planners or draughtsmen, and eain
enough to keep them and pay University
fees in the winter. The electrician has tor
four years worked on a railway from nine
at night till four in the morning, and in
the daytime he attends his classes and eats
bv accident and sleeps sometimes.
We came out of the restaurant, and next
door was a tailor’s sign to the effect that
he sold real Australian wool only—tor all-
wool is here a rarity, and all the varieties
of cotton and shoddy masquerade as it. the
sign gave us all a little more conceit ot
ourselves—and that little heart-lift was a
good thing for me at any rate. For here
the noise of the noisiest city on earth makes
New York lonelier for me than all the lone-
liness of I+ondon ever held; this hell ot
steel and concrete and the scum of Europe,
polyglot, brutal, stupid,. and abominably
10 In the night we went down Riversdale
Drive, overlooking the Hudson and the Pal-
isades —the arc lights winking on the trees,
and everybody at home except myselt. Lo
the young Australian artists who threaten
to come to New York, mostly to make
failures, I say: “Think of the loneliness,
and pause.” Take the loneliness of a soli-
tary camp in Westralia, the dreariness of
the black track through the button-grass on
the Balfour side of Whale Head, and when
you’ve done it, Loneliness does not begin
to explain itself. The greatest loneliness
is that of a city—a city like this—roar,
racket, jangle; less respect for human life
or human right than exists on many a
battlefield —little children weeping bitterly
in crowded streets, and none noticing
them; babies in gutters; dead dogs in
the streets, for the street sweepers of
the municipality must not shift anything
dead (that is the job of the Board of
Health, which is tardy in doing its job) ;
motors with horns that snarl and cough,
or gurgle like sea-sick pigs; motor-waggons;
horses slipping on the cruel unevenness of
the spalls. There it is a hell for the man
who- can think. Out among the trees, on
the Riverside Drive, the loneliness is
quieter, but almost as insistent.
The American is trying all sorts of avia-
tion —the dirigible, the monoplane, the bi-
plane —but the dirigible is not in the ques-
tion, because the wind resistance of it calls
for much of the power carried.
We came down Fifth Avenue on a
motor-’bus. Ahead, the mad lights ot
Broadway—the lunatic electric advertise-
ments, which blink and shiver and wriggle
from dusk to midnight—flared obscenely in
the sky. And the vulgarity of it all —noise
and yeli and crepitation and clamor made
the loneliness the more unendurable. And
suddenly there was a whirring ahead, and
out of the night, steering swiftly through
the reflected lanes of light, came a dirigible,
dominating the sky-scrapers, its machinery
humming like a great bee. We cheered
that man in the high swung machine as he
disappeared in the night, rising over above
the noises and the crowd.

A man told me to-day that he intended
to leave journalism and become treasuiei
of anew religious movement. I wondered,
and he explained: — ...
“My brother-in-law, said he, is L-rastus
Board. He was a magnetic spell-binder ot
the Baptists. He was engaged to a daughter
of a Wall-street man, and pa-in-law
thought the church wasn’t re-spectable, an
wouldn’t let ’em marry, an’ the girl snooped.
Pa-in-law offered to buy E-rastus a seat on
the Stock Exchange if he would quit the
church. So E-rastus quit. He quit wiser
He preached an unorthodox sermon an
they asked him to resign. He went to
Wall-street, an’ he lost 250,000 dollars of
his client’s money by bad ad-vice. So he
had to rejoin the church, an’ now he s got
a charter through two Houses of the State
Legislature to christianise the whole world.
He says people believe in the Bible, an
don’t know it.”
“Why does he want a charter i
“Why ! He wants 5,000,000 dollars for the
money side of the proposition, an’ it can’t
be got with any security for the stock-
holders without a charter from the Legis-
lature. That’s why.”
Another fake! And Princetown College
got another 20,000,000 dollars the other
day. These great fortunes are curses, even
after they have left the hands of the men
who got them somehow. They make oli-
garchies everywhere. Carnegie is one of
these curse-makers —and only one of many.
He advertises more than the others. That
is the only difference.
Out of the steel Tophet of New York,
on the moonlit harbor to Staten Island
and the flaring cupola of an iron furnace
in blast, notching the dim western shore,
the St. George ferry takes you to Staten
Island. St. George is a patron saint of
England, but they admire George the Cap-
padocian because he got rich by graft On
war contracts. But near the ferry is a
lot of property, owned privately by the
reigning house of England, and St. George’s
ferry may have something to do with that.
Many of the passengers of these moonlit
trips to Staten Island bring with them
their dogs. The New York old lady and
her dog are as inseparable as the London
old lady and Tier tripe-hound. The New
York old lady objects to children roller-
.skating in Central Park, and also objects
to the muzzling of dogs in summer, though
hydrophobia is fairly common. This kind
of criminal sentimentality is the most dis-
gusting feature of cities like London and
New York.
America is rich in the open-air sentimenta-
list —the man who can’t enjoy sunlight
without founding a sunlight cult. Old
Elbert Hubbard is one of the worst of
them, and his cult is so strong that although
he preaches a ferocious morality, he lost
only a few adherents when his wife divorced
him. He was originally a canvasser for
a soap manufacturer. He is now a soap-
maker and purveys both kinds—common
yellow and the soft variety.
Old Mother Hubbard
He went to the cupboard
And brought out tripe and sham.
But thousands believe in him —bang on his
platitudes as if they were divine revela-
tions.
The woman in America has the whip
hand in matrimony- to a greater extent than
with us, but I know one man who breaks
the Decalogue with a cheerful cynicism
that almost excuses the breakage. His
name is Dave Magee, and his wife is a very
nice lady. She had looked very happy last
time I saw her, and I remarked it to him.
“Yair,” he said; “Honey ’n’ me have
made good again. You see we wasn’t
friends for quite a while —five months we
wasn’t talking much. She got peeved.”
“What about?”
“Well, y’ see, she thought I was goin’ to
Philadelphia, ’an then she found me an’ the
Affinity. An’, I says to her: ‘If you go
round finding me out, it only makes us
both unhappy. An’,’ I says, ‘when you see
a live wire side-step it. If you sees a plug
of dynamite with a short time-payment fuse
about it, turn it down cold.’ ”
“You’re a bad man, Dave.”
“That’s what she says. She says: ‘Dave
—I mean Mister Magee —I’m going to di-
vorce you as soon as I can make up my
mind. You’re a bad man,’ she says, an
I love you, an’ you’re a hoodoo for me.
It’s Reno for mine,’ she says. So we had
rooms next door, but seperate, an’ for the
sake of looking as if we were makin’ gMd,
we used to sit together at the boarding-
house table. Ter’ble fond of her, I am, an’
her foolishness hurts me lots. One day she
says to me: ‘Dave,’ she says, ‘I mean Mister
Magee, one of these days I’ll divorce you,’
she says, ‘but meantime I’m bearin’ your
name, an’ it’s only right to tell you that
the little Frenchman opsit us at table is
makin’ shaky eyes at me, an’ altogether
gettin’ too fresh and chesty.’
“I says, ‘Right, Honey: I’ll put him in
his class!’ She says: ‘Don’t get me talked
about.’ An’ I says, ‘I’ll pick a row with
him, so fill-fired discreet nobody will know
why/
“So at dinner that night I leaned over
to him as he was caressin’ his little wire
whiskers an’ his owl’s-nest beard, with eau-
de-Cologne drippin’ off it into his soup, an’ I
says, ‘Na-poleon was a great hog.’
“He looked at me surprised, but hedidn 1
want any rough house, because it might have
taken a' curl out of the garden-stuff he wore
on his face. .
“Then I says, ‘France is a bum nation !
“He agreed it was. Says. that the States
Unis is good enough for him, an’ he says
something about La Belle Americanne, an’
he looks at my little wife with great bedroom
eyes, an’ he made me get madder.
'“‘An’, I; says, ‘you are the bummest
Frenchman of the bum nation,’ and he
frowns with one of them Paris noospapers
dooels in each eye, an’ he says: ‘You give
me the insult!’
“Well, there was just in front of me a
large pie—not what you’d call a pie, but an
American pie.”
“I know! A sort of open-work tart, with
three inches of custard in it.”
“You’re wise! Well, I picked up the
pie, and shoved it at him with the open-
work foremost, an’ I says: ‘I’ll shove all
this soft stuff into your little wire-whiskers,
an’ then I’ll shove the blamed dish down
your gardam throat.’
“An’ he got up quite pale an’ never
looked at Honey no more, an’ shifted him-
self off the earth. My wife finished dinner,
and I got up an’ followed her. She opened
her room door, an’ as I was . goin’ on she
said: ‘Come in here for a minit. Dave —I
mean Mr. Magee. I want to speak to you.’
“I went in, an’ she shut the door an’ she
says: ‘Dave Magee, you’re a bad man, an’
I’m goin’ to divorce you just as soon as I
can find the pluck!’ And then she kinder
sudden puts her arms round me neck, holdin’
on to the lapels of me coat, an’ she says :
‘Oh, you great, big, brave, splend’, magni-
ficent; sooperb man, to put that chesty little
Frenchman in his class.’ An’ then she
heaves a great big sigh, an’ says: ‘Well, I
spose I gotter forgive you. You kin kiss
me, Dave.’ ”

■BABCOO ROT*
Indescribable Torture of Bursting: Blisters and
Spreading: Sores.—Other Ointments Prove Useless.
One of the Terrors of Out-hack
MR. H. McDIARMED, of 150 Nichol-
son Street, Abbotsford, Vic., says :
“ I contracted a terrible skin com-
plaint while employed in the grape-picking
industry in the Mildura district of Victoria. The
disease which is known as ‘ Barcoo Rot, started in the
form of blisters, which appeared on the face and then
extended to the arms, finally spreading all over the
back. These blisters would burst and then form
into the shape of ringworms. The irritation nearly
drove nre mad, and I felt I could tear myself to
pieces. It was torture indescribable, for I could
not obtain a moment’s rest, and I became run-down
in health, and felt depressed and despondent. I
applied an ointment, but this only increased the
irritation and caused it to spread alarmingly, thus
adding to my misery.
“I was tortured in this way for six weeks. I
gave up the idea of ever getting well again, when
Zam-Buk was recommended to me. I promptly
discontinued the ordinary ointments, and com-
menced using Zam-Buk. Immediately Zam-Buk
was applied I felt its soothing effect, and the irri-
tation ceased. Other applications of this healing
balm brought a decided improvement in my con-
dition. It acted like a charm, and I could not

realise that I was fast getting better. After using Zam-Buk fora fortnight, the sores were
all healed, new skin formed, and I was completely cured. My skin was spotless, and, in
fact, I presented a better appearance than I did before I contracted this awful complaint.
My health is better in every way, and I never felt more fit than I do at the present
time, which is entirely due to Zam-Buk."

I thank the gods (jf g 0( ; s there be)
For m 3' unconquerable soul. — Henley.
your “ unconquerable soul,”
I But diligently bear in mind
That Life is not a wayward stroll,
For Circumstance asserts control
And fiercely prods you up behind.
This dictum you can safely trust—
Growl you may, but Go you must.
No further bluff, for Satan’s sake.
A bulrush never can be strong.
You’re overmatched —make no mistake—
The option is to bend or break ;
In either case, you’re forced along.
And what avails your cheap disgust?
Growl you may, but Go you must.
In point of fact, your name is Sludge,
And puppet-like your lot is cast,
For though you may rebel and grudge,
And spitefully refuse to budge,
Your claim will be pegged out at last.
Sludge unto sludge, and dust to dust—
Growl you may, but Go you must.
Next hear St. Peter’s challenge keen :
“ My son, you’ve failed to nick a goal.
In headstrong wickedness serene,
You feared not parson, king or queen ;
Your bible was The Bullytekn ;
Wherefore, your name is off the roll.
No picnic on these meadows green,
No part in this celestial scene.
For your unconquerable soul.
March down yon steps —the doom is just—
Growl you may, but Go you must.”

The Land of Tanks.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN you travel over the great
western country, with the solitary
question of water in your mind (and
you don’t want a piece of string tied round
your finger to keep it from slipping your
memory), you realise the grim, dodged fight
that has been made by the m* .1 who have
settled there. Thousands o: creeks and
gullies vein this region, just toe same as in
other parts, but they are treacherous affairs
to the stranger who is lured by the promis-
ing lines and clumps of timber to search
for potholes, such as his “inside” experi-
ence leads him to expect. There are rivers
too, draining vast areas of one State, and
moistening hundreds of miles of another.
They start far north with a roaring flood,
and are exhausted and lost in the immensity
of their travels or they end their long jour-
ney with a brown trickle that creeps into
the Darling or Murray. When settlers
along the upper reaches of eastern rivers
are flooded, warning is sent to those far
down to prepare for the coming rush; hut
the people at the lower end of the Outback
waterways only hear casually that a big flood
has happened above them. Though it may
sweep grandly for a couple of hundred miles,
only now and again do they expect it to run
in their part of the course. The great plain
awaits it with parched lips. Thirstily,
greedily, it drinks up the river.
The great bulk of the inland drainage
courses underground, down the ever-flowing
subterranean channels. When you look at
the surface courses after a dry storm, you
can’t but think that any other kind of river
is impossible without some gigantic scheme
of afforestation. To the small settler, who
wants to wet his whistle in a hurry, the
underground river is hopeless. Still he
goes out and prospers. One, whom I knew
well, after working for some years on the
roads with a team, took up a dry selection
in the Corner, starting with a few sheep.
He passed in his checks in 1909, leaving to
his widow and children a well-watered es-
tate and £32,000 in cash. He was a canny
Scot. All he did to make his pile was to
put down a couple of tanks in the midst of
timber. Most western graziers make their
tanks in the sun-baked, wind-swept open, so
that the sheep, after drinking, won’t camp
round the tank. Both sheep and tank sufiei
in consequence.
“Death’s Corner” and “Hell’s Gate” were
pet terms applied to the Big Basin by thirst-
tortured travellers from inside. The great,,
deceiving distances, the sun-glitter on the
stones, the mocking mirages, and the ap-
parent barrenness of everything around, are
heart-breaking to the peddler and the swag-
man. But they get a grip of the immense
possibilities of "that territory when they
know that, after years of drought, fat sheep
have been obtained there when they could
lot be got anywhere else. The mainstays
of the land are mulga and saltbush. In
fair seasons Mitchell grass grows like wheat.
Cut and stored, it is as good as oaten hay.
In fact, it is better, for the haymaker has
not to plough or sow—he merely reaps.
When the grass is in ear, he drives his
machine across the plain, and within a few
hours the “cut” is ready to stack. The hay
has been found to be sweet and fattening
after being stacked for 20 years. There
is no trouble about feed. The great prob-
lem is water. You daren’t ride a few miles
out on the run without taking a bag of it
with you, or the chances are there will be a
funeral, and you’ll be in it.
When the “insider” goes on the land the
first thing he does is to put up a hut; but
when the westerner goes on to his block the
first thing he has to do is to make a water-
.hole. ' That is the most important and the
most valuable improvement he can make.
Ills wealth is reckoned, and his status in
the community determined, by the number
of waterholes he has. In putting down his
first he has to choose his time, when rain
has left a pothole within reach to supply
him and his teams with liquid refreshment.
Then it is a race between the sinking of the
tank, and the sinking of the water. When
his hole is completed he goes away, to wait
till the next rain comes and fills it. Then
he may return and build his home. It is
a big undertaking for the small man, but
once he has amassed waterholes he can sit
back and live comfortably on the interest.
Most of the work is done by contract. In
earlier days tank-sinkers reaped a rich har-
vest, getting 1/- a yard for excavation which
is now done for as low as 4d. The land-
owner finds the plant —horses, ploughs,
scoops and harness. Bullocks are some-
times used for ploughing, but as a rule they
are considered too slow and unwieldy.
Horses are worked three and four abreast to
save time in turning, and to prevent un-
necessary climbing and consequent damage
to the batters. Close by the work is a sap-
ling yard, witli grindstones, water-tanks on
drays, and a small forge for pointing shares
and picks and shoeing horses. The men
live in tents or canvas huts walled in with
bushes; and there is a long shed, walled and
roofed with boughs or cane-grass, for eating
and cooking in; while out in front is a
fireplace, enclosed in a semi-circular wall
of stones to protect it from the wind. Round
the fire, in this rootless enclosure, the men
sit and smoke their pipes and “swap yarns”
after tea. Occasionally on moonlight
nights they work an hour or two at the
forge, repairing damaged swingle-bars or
mounting new ones, and making horse-shoes
and scoop-handles. He has to be a handy
man, the tanksinker. On Sunday morning
a tank or two of water is carted, and a
load of dry mulga or gidgee for camp vise.
Besides all this there are broken chains to
mend with split links, and horse-collars and
other harness ware to attend to. The tank-
sinker makes hay while the sun shines,
working from daylight till dark. Then tin-
horses are driven away to water and feed,
a sheep is killed by starlight, and now and
again a bag of grass is cut and carried home
on the pommel of the saddle for the hack,
which is kept in the yard all night for run-
ning up the draught horses in the morn-
ing.
Some contractors keep a bullock team con-
stantly drawing water, so as to save the
plough and scoop horses by watering them
in iron troughs where they work.
Hard years of experience taught thp
Hock-owners many economic points in the
excavating of tanks. The open-fronted
tanks, into Which everything poured un-
checked and played havoc with the batters,
are no longer made; nor is the partially-
banked variety with a catch-tank in front,
from which the force of the overflow cut
huge gutters through the intervening space,
carrying the silt into the main tank, 01
else it ploughed through the light wings
and cut gutters down the outside of the
bank. Tanks nowadays are banked high
all round with earth scooped out of the
excavation. You see these grey banks every
now and again as you travel the roads. The
Darling Downs is a land of wells and wind-
mills. A part of Southern Queensland spe-
cialises in substantially-constructed over-
flows. In other parts, where water has a
habit of running away at short notice, the
ordinary cheap variety of dam is the com-
mon reservoir. But the north-west of New
South Wales is the land of tanks.
Some of the tanks are so large that you
can spend hours round them shooting
ducks. A few contain yellow-belly (golden
perch), and in most of them youngsters
catch crawfish with scoop nets and traps.
A small catch-tank is made at the top end,
from which fluming is laid through the
banked-up earth, having a .self-acting valve
on the inside and from this a race, made'
of galvanised iron, posts and rails, runs
down to the bottom of the main tank.
These tanks hold well if a foot of water is
first run in, and the bottom and sides arc
then puddled and trampled by putting a
mob of sheep in and driving them round.
The great bulk of the shifting sand is
checked by the earth walls, but still a lot
goes over, tons of dust fixing deposited dur-
ing every dry storm. The evaporation is
very considerable. Roly-polies do a great
amount of damage. These are huge white
balls of grass and burrs from two to three
feet in diameter, that roll mile after mile
across the plains, banking up against fences
and completely smothering them, and bowl-
ing down into unprotected tanks.
Here and there stub walls have been built
as a partial protection; but these are soon
buried under sand, and the roly-poley
takes a flying leap over them and goes gam-
bolling on in triumph. A hundred rolies
racing acros a plain in the moonlight is a
weird sight; a few score bogged in the silt
round the edges of a tank means a big fall
in the value of the reservoir.
Dams are made in some of the creeks—a
huge bank of earth, rocks and boughs (for
binding) being formed across a narrow neck
to throw the water back. Many such dams
are constructed at considerable expense,
only to be swept away by the first flood
that comes down. After heavy rains the
water rushes down from the rocky hills in
foaming torrents, sometimes several miles
wide, levelling fences, yards, and all such
structures before it. At these times half
that “desert” country presents the aspect
of a vast inland sea; yet in a little while
a man might perish of thirst while follow-
ing the winding creeks in search of a pot-
hole. All that enormous bulk of water
has run to waste, and the four winds begin
to gather up the dust again. Only the
tanks, the salvation of Outback, remain.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
•in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or. Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
Price 1/6. From all Chemists and
Medicine Vendors, and W. G. Hearns &
