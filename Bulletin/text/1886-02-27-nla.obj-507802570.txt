such sentiments that the sense of mankind
has been repressed, distorted, and bewil-
dered. All the civilised world has been in
this fashion taught and trained to believe
that a readiness to “leave all and follow ”
not Christ, but the War-Devil, is a trait
necessary to complete nobility of character,
e e m
This we regaid as a fearful perversion of
the functions of the journalist—the really
potent teacher and preacher of the age.
Without going so far as to allege that wars
would cease, we do pronounce without
reservation that were journalists through-
out the world uniformly to dwell upon the
true morality of nations, and to encourage
the masses to work for their real prosperity,
there would be an immense abatement of
that scourge of the human race. The practice
"Bhe mastery of man over the animals is
.scarcely more remarkable than that thein-
tfluence exerted by the few over the multi-
tude. It has often been remarked that if
brutes could reason the spectacle of the
■comparatively weak human biped lording it
■over horses and oxen, elephants and camels
would swiftly disappear. Yet the labours
iimposed upon beasts of burden are really
<of small moment when contrasted with the
•exactions, travail, and sufferings to which
ithe masses of mankind are subjected by a
mere handful of their fellows. The most
extraordinary among the many strange
features of this condition of affairs is that
a multitude of the victims of the system do
not merely emulate the docility of the
orutes, but actually cling to theii servitude
and permit themselves to be made the will-
ing tools of their oppressors in repressing
any movement among their fellow-suf-
ferers to ameliorate their common lot. The
spectacle of a myriad of human beings
clanking their chains with a pretence of
enjoyment, and lending their aid to destroy
■or joining in a chorus of abuse against any
individuals who may attempt or offer to
alleviate their conditions, is one of the most
mysterious problems of ; existence. This ex-
traordinary phenomenon has engaged the
attention of philosophers in all ages; but
of late years has received increasing notice.
As yet, however, no explanation of the pre-
valence of the conditions has been offered
Which promises a genuine and permanent
amelioration, and which has received the
sanction of universal acceptance. When an
explanation of that nature shall receive
such acceptance the hour of radical change
will have struck upon the clock of the
Ages.

In order that the situation may be clearly
Understood,'illustration will be convenient.
We may, therefore, instance, as an ex-
ample, the related subjects of war and
glory. During the preparations for the
recent struggle between the Servian King
and the Prince of Bulgaria, the repug-
nance existing among the subjects of
the first-mentioned monarch to face the
miseries of a campaign, were accentuated
hy the prevalence of a desperate expedient
hi’self-mutilation among the men dragged
from civil pursuits to join the army. In
ordinary conversation, when a person de-
sires to emphasise in the strongest degree
the repugnance which he feels with respect
to any course of action, it is common for
him to express his feelings in the phrase
that he would “sooner cut off his right
hand ” than submit to this or that. The un-
happy Servian, dragged by the summons of
the military authorities from his plough,
vineyard, and from the arms of his sweet-
heart, or the bosom of bis family, actually
.parried this sentiment into practice. He
"dJi off such part of his right hand as was
-essential to the management of a weapon,
ffhis frightful expedient did not save him.
■lt merely hastened and insured his doom,
and heaped upon his devoted head the
additional outrage of infamy to his memory.
Most readers will be able to recall an item
So recent as the cablegrams which conveyed
fhe information respecting this practice
among Servian conscripts, and few will
have failed to notice the unanimity with

paign was despicable and infamous. It has

at present is to hocuss the people with
drams of “glory,” and to take advantage of
them while under the influence of the
delirium occasioned by that stimulant, to
hurry them to their undoing, and often to
their death. A Social system which enables
the fortunate or knowing ones to so organise
affairs that the fruits of the labours of the
many accumulate in the hands of the few—
that the toiler is barely able to retain
sufficient of what he creates by his labour
to keep the breath of life in his body, while
the schemer and his heirs are corrupted by
unearned superfluity—requires that the
senses of the masses shall be undermined by
some such expedient.
» * *
It is almost inconceivable that the millions
should tamely acquiesce in a system which
permits the idle to dominate the industrious,
and which countenances an arrogance treat-
ing labour as a disgrace and honouring sheer
loafing as a dignity. Yet such is to-day the
universally accepted standard of social
thought. To be usefully employed in in-
dustrial occupations is a bar to social dis-
tinction. To consume without producing
is to secure deference and consideration.
To organise successful massacres is the
surest road to high rank. Whereas by de-
voting one’s life to the alleviation of disease,
scarcely one man in a million may procure
the fag end of a titular distinction*
♦ * *
Yet the sentiment of equity is innate in
every bosom. Men fret at what they call
fate, and nevertheless help, often with
every appearance of exaltation, to mutually
forge each other’s fetters. In the feudal days,
when a great noble had so pillaged his own
dependents that they were utterly devoid
of means of subsistance, they marched
cheerfully under his banner to help him
to pillage their neighbours, and to reduce
these to the same extremity of suffering.
When the English colonists in America rose in
resistance to legalised spoliation and tribute,
not only did the yokel from the plough in
the old country—although himself ground
down by similar exactions to the very dust-
shoulder the musket with unthinking
alacrity, and march forth with his bosom
swelling with spurious “loyalty” to stake
his very life in the endeavour to bring his
brother across the Atlantic back to
the yoke of plundering authority, but
entire strangers were brought into the
contention, and made to stake their
lives and risk all the agonies of a death of
lingering torture on the field of battle, in
order that crazy George 111. of England
might rob American cultivators of a big
quart out of every bushel of corn they gar-
nered by the sweat of their brow. Miserable
Gormans were actually sold by their extor-
tioners to the English King, at per head*
The Duke of Hesse-Cassel furnished regi-
ments of his subjects for about £3 per head,
who were shipped off to repress the growth
of freedom. Prior to this the Guem had
used their continental connections against
the English themselves, against the Scotch,
and against the Irish. There were permanent
conventions with the Dutch and Hanoverians
to furnish contingents of troops to quell any
attempt of Englishmen to expel the Gusli's
in favour of the Stuarts. When the Duke
of Cumberland, fresh from his disgrace at
Fontenoy, marched to Inverness to do battle
with the Jacobites, under Charles Edward
Stuart, he led more Hanoverians and Hes-
sians than he did British troops to the
slaughter at Culloden. When, after centuries
of the bitterest oppression, during which
every right of nature had been denied to the
miserable commoners of France, that nation
rose against its tyrants, and, with savage
reaction upon savagery, swept into undis-
tinguishable destruction king and courtier!
priest and courtesan, the kings of the earth
were able to marshall myriads of men, all
just about as imfamously oppressed and
wronged as the French had been, to endea-
vour to extirpate the sentiment of equality
and to restore the old evil order. When, a
little later, the first Napoleon strove to
substitute a single tyrant for a multitude,
and aimed at reintroducing the old Roman
Empire of the West, after devasting a coun-
try he enrolled its ruined inhabitants in his
legions, and used Saxons to scourge Bava-
rians, Poles to slaughter Spaniards—ltalians,
Spaniards, Poles, Saxons, Swiss—a hetero-
geneous mass of dull-witted animals, to prop
his throne and each to quell and slaughter
the other. Thus likewise in Hindostan the
British conquered India chiefly with Sepoy
troops. To-day she transports natives of
the Himalayan foothills to crush national
aspirations among Egyptian serfs. The
white Czar uses the life’s blood of the con*
quered Finn, Cossack, and Circassian, to
enslave the Tartar 5 and to bring the climax
home to ourselves, there were not lacking
Australians to volunteer to lay down their
lives with the object of crushing the manly
aspirations of love of country and of liberty
among Arabs, thousands of miles away.

“Oh, fools! mostly fools,” as true Thomas
—not the Rymer of Ercildoune, but he of
Chelsea—exclaimed. Every slave forging
fetters for his brothers and delivering them
bound hand and foot to the oppressor.
Consider what it all means. When the
“great” Frederic led his Prussians to
war, what had any man in the ranks to
gain ? Exposure, toil, wounds, long-drawn
torture, freezing on the bloody field after
the battle, death, or an old age of penury.
Soldiers do not save for their declining
years. They sow the face of the world with
blood and tears, but they harvest nothing
themselves. Frederic’s “greatness was
due to his greed to wrench a province from
the ruler of Austria, The provocation
was that that ruler was young, and a
woman. The inducement was that he, and
not she, might extort plunder from the
people of that unhappy Silesia. The interest
of the combatants on each side—these cheer-
ing, saluting, drumming and fifing brave
brainless fools who did the fighting and
took the suffering was—what? To turn
round, each army on its gracious sovereign
and distinguished commanders, and shoot
these wild beasts down—then, shaking
hands all round, to beat their swords

into ploughshares, their spears into
pruning-hooks, and set to work to cultivate
the ground, and live and love and laugh
with children around them, and no Divine-
right plunderer to strip their granaries and
their vineyards to support him in pride and
harlotry. The moral is universal. The in-
dividual has no interest in war. “ Glory
is a mockery used to intoxicate men, and,
like wine, to “steal their brains away.
Honour is not an hysterical emotion. It is a
noble principle of common life, which for-
bids, among other crimes, an upright and
intelligent man from taking part in a quarrel
not personal to himself, and not occasioned
by some breach of a distinct moral principle.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Coalitions.
lisr Victoria and In New South Wales, parties
having expended themselves for a time, Coalition
Ministries are the resource of politicians destitute
of determinate principles. This would appear to
demonstrate a happy condition were the circum-
stances of these colonies in real correspondence
with the inanition of political representatives,
that is to say, were there really no principles the
application of which would tend to the present
Improvement and future prosperity of these
Communities, it would he a matter for rejoicing
that such harmony among members of ParUa-
tnent that the best men from the elect of the
people could come together to form a Cabinet.
But no person would be venturesome enough to
pretend that the affairs of these colonies are
being administered on lines which require no
remodelling, there is scope enough for the
genius of the reformer-only there are no
reformers. In New South Wales, the efforts
to form a combination have, so far, not
only failed to indicate a general disposi-
tion among leading politicians to adopt a unifor-
mity of principle, but they have, on the contrary,
exposed an inclination all round to abandon what-
ever principles the individuals have hitherto pre-
tended to be actuated by; In one of the gravest
crises of the history of the colony, instead of call-
ing in the strongest man, the intriguers for office
accommodate their ambitions by attaching them-
selves to Sir Patrick Jennings -a gentleman
Who owes any prominence he has attained in
political dlrcles chiefly to his possession of ample
means, and to his having the constant support of
the Roman Catholic vote. The reason for his
election to lead the late Opposition, again, has,
obviously enough, no relation to the measure of
his abilities as compared with that of other mem-
bers of the Legislative Assembly. It is undis-
guisedly founded upon the amiability of his dis-
position, and the genial equableness of his
temperament. Now, to select a loader for these
qualities—admirable as they are—ls undoubtedly a
tremendous mistake at a period of exceptional
difficulty. Besides, the Coalition under Sir
Patrick's patronage is not a fusion of potent
parties, combining and exhausting all the con-
stituent forces of the Assembly. It is the mere
accidental aggregation of the atoms of several
wrecked administrations, and these atoms never
had distinctiveness of repulsion sufficient to indi-
cate that by a reversal of the poles they will
henceforth possess a powerful cohesion. Such a
coalition can, in all likelihood, have but one good
influence on the politics of New South Wales. Its
existence may serve to create a real Opposition of
genuine solidarity, out of which, ere long,
a really stable Government may be formed.

North Shore Consciences.
That was a gratifying meeting which took place
at the North Shore, Sydney, on Monday last, to
urge the immediate construction of a railway
to intersect North Shore land-owners’property.
Several speakers announced themselves as in-
terested in tke project, and it wis stated that quite
a proportion were prepared to transfer to tho
State the slices of their land requisite for the rail-
way, without charge-let alone compensation. We
rejoice to observe this. It affords evidence that
the public conscience is awakening, and that a
fierce reference to “ the rights of property ” is no
longer regarded as ample; justification for a
plan of public plunder. Sir Henry Parkes also
lightly touched upon the same topic. He could not
see why, in view of the great enhancement to the
valtie of all adjacent property occasioned by the
construction of a railway, land-owners should
demand compensation. No more do we. Indeed,
we go further, and we predict that, before many
years shall have passed, a Government valuator
Will inspect all lands Which a proposed railway
would affect, in order toiestlmate not only how
much would require in equity to be paid to
owners of small holdings which the lines would
absorb altogether or cut into useless fractions,
but also what should be contributed to the State
by owners of large tracts, in consideration of the
increase of values to be effected by the expendi-
ture’ of public moneys in rendering these localities
accessible.

“Her Hour of Need.”
A CABLEGRAM says“ It is hoped in England that
the colonies will contribute to the relief of the
unemployed in England.” Here is an obvious
chance for Plain Bill Dalley to emerge from his
boiler, or whatever recess has lately served to hide
him. Here we have “ the Mother Country in her
hour of Need,” Billy. Up and be doing 1
William. But no 5 the Unornamental One main-
tains silence. He keeps the stopper in his blather-
bladder. There’s no glory in this business.
There’s no slaughter. There’s no soft soap any-
where hanging on to it to be blown into prlsmatic-
hued bubbles, or frothed up into a declamatory
lather. No vain fools’ noble blood surges up in
gorgeous emulation at the mere prospect of
making an un-noted sacrifice of some personal
comfort, indulgence, or luxury, in order to be able
to help snatch from misery and destitution an un-
interesting lot of squalid English people.
Had it been to help murder a parcel of
patriotic Arabs now, there would have been
no lack of enthusiasm. Plain Bill would have
teen transfigured—a glorious, if podgy, spectacle
smashing the Constitution with a valour only
limited by the fact that there is no way of punish-
ing people who shatter a trilie of that kind,
although a fellow who wilfully cracks a window
pane can bo sent to gaol. Oh, yes I There would
have been a pretty splutter. The Little Boy at
Manly and the old woman at Government House
would simultaneously have been inspired with the
idea of writing a letter to the noble and spirited
originator of the Patriotic Fund, and the former
would have looked among his toys for his little
cheque-book and have sat down and squared his
elbows and followed his pen with his prehensile
tongue while he laboriously wrote out in his
very best “ half text,” his order to pay Dalley or
bearer the sum of £5O-out of his pocket-money.
He would have cheerfully deprived himself of a
diamond-mounted top and a set of exquisitely
carved alley-tors to assist in so inspiring a busi-
ness. The old party at Government House would
also have, at any sacrifice, contributed his—
patronage. But for the relief of the mere starv-
ing unemployed! Faugh! What do they mean
with intruding their vulgar distresses between
the wind and our Jingoes’ somewhat recent gen-
tility ? What business is it of ours, anyhow ? "We
didn’t unemploy these sufferers. Besides, haven’t
they been making a disturbance, breaking club
windows, looting jewellers’ shops, and thus for-
feiting any claim whatever to consideration ?
They should have starved in decent silence and in
well-regulated order.
*
The Sydney "Echo” and Eoman
Catholicism.
As an example of the little progress made by
Roman Catholicism in England, the Sydney Echo
cites the fact that but three “ Romans ’’—two of
them Irish—were returned for English consti-
tuencies at the last election. We think that the
circumstance points rather to the bigotry of
Englishmen than in any other direction. In Ire-
land, where about 83 per cent of the people follow
Rome, a Protestant has* if anything, a better
chance of election than a Catholic. The fact
noticed by the Echo has a significance far deeper
than la attributed to it by that journal. A
conquering people always hold the conquered
in a certain contempt, just as converts look
with contempt on the faith they have for-
saken. The Norman canaille looked super-
ciliously on the Anglo-Saxons they subdued.
They viewed with equal scorn the Irish Celts they
subsequently conquered. After Jena the Parisians
estimated one Frenchman to be equal to two or
three Prussians just as, to the present day, one
Englishman is considered a match for a large
number of foreigners. After Sedan and Metz
each Uhlan thought himself fit for a company of
"red-breeches.” If the Maoris had offered no
greater resistance than the aborigines of Australia
to colonial land-grabbers no native representa-
tives would be found in Wellington (N Z.) to-day.
The Englishman has proved himself a sturdy con-
queror and an admirable colonist. Indeed, in
the latter capacity it is doubtful whether
he has ever been equalled among the world’s
ruling races. But in one thing he is entirely de-
ficient—the art of conciliating those whom he sub-
dues. This, perhaps, is not so much Bull’s fault
as the fault of the ruling classes who, for cen-
turies, denied him knowledge while cultivating
his prejudices. Now that a suffrage but one re-
move from universal has toppled the “ upper ”
classes from the elevation they so long usurped
and disgraced, the political tutelage of the Eng-
lishman may be said to have ended. It will, of
course, take time and training to bring the
ordinary Briton in line with the advanced
doctrines of to-day. And this brings us back
to the small number of Catholics returned
for English constituencies. It is not to the
absence of candidates of that creed, nor to their
ineligibility that the fact is due. It is to the pre-
judices engendered by centuries of class govern-
ment. We are no lovers of Rome or of her teach-
ings. But we trust the day is at hand when the
fact of a man’s believing in one God or three, or
none at all—in the superiority of faith over works*
or in the conviction that yearly confession is
necessary for salvation—will be kept severely out
of sight by an enlightened democracy, and that a
person’s fitness or unfitness to make laws will not
depend upon the meridian under which he hap-
pened to be born, or the faith he imbibed with his
mother’s milk.
Savings and Savings Banks.
The Savings Bank of New South Wales has pub-
lished its annual statement, and reports an in-
crease of 2855 in the number of depositors, and of
£129,397 in the amount of deposits since December,
1884. This has been the signal for some of the
Sydney daily papers to break out with the con-
ventional babble of congratulation. The Echo
and the S.M. Herald, for example, bleat forth
the supposed truism—for, if any opinion were not
apparently stamped with the warrant-mark of
antiquity, the Echo would shrink from adventur-
ing it—that " one of the most important Indices to
the thrift and prosperity of the middle classes in
our community is furnished by the annual state-
ments of the accounts of the Savings Banks of
New South Wales. The statements for the past
year have just been published, and show a most
gratifying result.” If the Echo could rise in the
scale of Intelligence to the altitude of independent
thought, it might not be so cock-sure that increased
deposits in savings banks, separately considered,
are conclusive evidence of an augmentation of
thrift and prosperity among the depositors. The
fact that persons are able to make deposits is
gratifying, unquestionably. It shows that there
is a large body of people whose labour returns
them more than sufficient for maintenance. But
the fact that people do make deposits, is another
affair altogether. That may be interpreted in
many ways. Except squandering money, there is
probably no more useless way of disposing of it
than placing it in the Savings Bank, because there
is no investment which gives such paltry returns.
The increase in the number of depositors, and in
the amount of the deposits may just as fairly be
taken to signify that times are commercially bad,
and that persons find it increasingly difficult to get
I profitable investment for small capital, as that it
I indicates an increase of thrift. It may be thrift—
I but it may also—and looking at all the surround-
ing conditions more probably is—be due to a re-
striction of opportunities of advantageous use.
One thing, however, may be hoped, and that is—
that of the moneys lodged in the New South
Wales Savings Bank to be available for the larger
capitalists, who are the borrowers —some con-
siderable proportion has been withheld from that
disastrous form of investment the purchase of
slices of land, sold by forestalled to uninstructed
people of small means, who are caught by the
allurements of long terms, and the Instalment
system of payment—unconscious that these are
the baits which conceal a snare of monstrous
prices.

A Glimmer of Reason.
Political leaders seem sometimes to have a
glimmering perception of the best economical
policy which can be followed in a new country.
The last Minister for Lands In Victoria had
plans prepared, showing all the unsold and un-
appropriated Crown lands within 30 miles of Mel-
bourne, and has left a memorandum recommend-
ing that these be permanently reserved as an en-
dowment for educational purposes. That Is to
say, this Minister recommended that a portion of
the land should continue nationalized, the
rents to be devoted to a particular branch of the
national expenditure. If this be a good thing in
detail, why should it not be a good thing in whole-
sale ? For example, why not permanently reserve
another tract of unalienated lands as an endow-
ment for the administration of Justice; a third
tract as an endowment for the construction and
maintenance of Public Works; yet another tract
as an endowment for National defence; another
as an endowment for encouragement of manufac-
tures, for Parliamentary expenses, and so forth.
By such reservations, it is quite clear, the cost of
every department of administration, and every
commercial or municipal requirement could be
defrayed. Then there would be no necesssity for
taxes 1 But all this depends upon the "if” we
started with, i e , if this reservation will really
serve as a full ample endowment for education, as
proposed by the Minister. That depends simply
upon the quantity and quality and situ-
ation of the land proposed to be nationalised.
Experience and induction are equally favourable.
To quote a few instances. The Bishopric of Syd-
ney is maintained almost exclusively by a compa-
ratively small "endowment” of Glebe lands, in
what is now a suburb of the city. Sir Daniel
Cooper derives his vast income almost en-
tirely from an " endowment ” of land made
to him in the form of a grant. If the
colony of N.S.W. had retained these few
thousand acres, it might now have been draw-
ing the revenues which go into the pocket of an
absentee. About one building in every five of the
splendid structures which have, within the past
half-dozen years, replaced in the city of Sydney
the shabby premises of past days, is erected at a
tenant’s cost upon leased land. The State
might just as well have remained land-
lord all the time. If, instead of jangling
in trumpery disputation as to which clique shall
have the chance of attaining power and exhibit-
ing in elevated positions the wretched idealess
plight of its members, local politicians would re-
solve that no more land shall be alienated, but
every remaining acre " reserved as an endow-
ment” for public purposes, deficits would soon
cease to trouble, and Treasurers’ temptations and
troubles would be connected with their super-
abundance of revenue.

Eoyil Tithes.
The degree of a man’s charity can be exactly
measured, and it is the only virtue which can be
reduced to strictly mathematical figures. By
charity, is meant in this sense, money gifts—be.
cause money is practically a fixed unit for all
material values whatever. A money gift, to come
under the head of charity, should bear exactly
proportion to all surplus moneys or property
which are beyond the reasonable necessities of the
class in which a man lives. When anyone has
made reasonable, and even liberal allowance, for
the claims which a certain stylo of lifenecessitates t
all else is surplus, and the question of what pro-
portion of that shall go the way of charity
and what reserved for the luxury that every
one naturally craves is a simple thing. Sup-
pose a man earns £3 a week and is a labourer-
Suppose, further, he can live quite up to his idea
of comfort on £2 10s., then the question is, if he
gives Is. out of the remaining ten in charity, is he
doing as much as is expected of him ? We main-
tain that in proportion to what the wealthy give
he overdoes his portion of charity to an enormous
extent. And this enables us to estimate two re-
cent charitable gifts (repayments without interest
they ought to be called) £5OO from the Queen and
£250 from the Prince of Wales towards the relief
of the unemployed. Fancy it 1 London now no
longer a mere city, but for wealth and population
and influence in the world—the great commercial
centre, the purse-holder of the world, the maker
or unmaker of national credits—wielder of a
mightier power than was ever held by any of the
great nations—London, at this bitter seacon, with
its tens of thousands of thousands, clamouring for
food in the slushy streets and its hundred thou-
sand shivering for shelter, and unable to do any-
thing but wrap their rags around them and die—
the London poor to be helped by £TSO out of a
household that can annually lay by half a million
that they will never need—a million drawn in great
part from the smugglings of those poor dumb
creatures. Their tithe of that should have been
£lOO.OOO on the spot, and nothing less than some
such royal duty—we will not call it charity will
at no remote date afford a check to the avalanche
begotten of wretchedness which all men who
have eyes can see approaching.
The Trustees of the New South Wales Public
Library have “ passed a resolution that in future
there be no restriction to the class of books issued ”
on Sundays. At least. Mr. Young informed Mr.
Copeland so lastweelr. What generous persons
the trustees must be ; positively slopping over,
w© should think, with the milk of human kind-
ness. They not on'y decide to do as Parliament
has ordered them, but they positively go to the
unnecessary trouble of passing a resolution to
accentuate their obedience. There is not only
generosity in their action, but downright strategy.
Had they merely torn down the offensive
notices, and gone back on their original
ukase, which is clearly beyond their powers,
it might have been thought that they had
been coerced by Mr. Copeland and The Bul-
letin ; now they have the honour of retreat-
ing from their invasion of the rights of the people
with drums beating and banners flying. A fort-
night ago it was darkly rumoured that the trustees
intended to shut up the lending branch on Sunday
altogether. Prudence has evidently forced them
to face the inevitable. The flrst answer to Mr.
Copeland, as much as this last one, shows that in
the public interest the trustees want a little watch-
ing, and we are not sorry that our articles in this
connection have led the trustees to a truer esti-
mate of their position and powers.
Sir John Robertson, -when called upon by
by Sir Patrick Jennings in re the formation of a
Ministry, only consented to act with Sir Patrick
on condition that Mr. Garvan, the mover of the
resolution which wrecked the late Robertson-
O’Connor Ministry, was not to be included in the
new team. Consequently, Mr. Garvan was not
waited upon by Sir Patrick Jennings. Sir John’s
hostility to Mr. Garvan appears to arise mainly
from the fact that the condition of parties, at the
time of the passing the vote of want of confi-
dence, was such that probably no one but Mr.
Garvan could have successfully submitted such a
resolution to the House. Mr. Garvan, who seems
all along to have been opposed to the coalition
idea, now goes into Opposition.
The New South Wales Assembly, on Tues-
day night, presented a curious spectacle. The de-
feated Premier moved the adjournment till 7 p.m.
on that night to allow the leader of the Opposition
to form a Government, the coming Premier re-
maining significantly silent. It was only the in-
tervention of the speaker which changed the
motion to an ordinary one of adjournment, and
gave Sir Patrick 21 hours more to collect his ill-
assorted team. Mr. Abbott did not add to his re-
putation by his short speech, in the course of
which he broached the extraordinary doctrine
that as there were no party-lines in the House
members could join any leader who might come
to the front. There is precious little adherence to
principle in any part of the House, but it is impos-
sible to follow out Mr. Abbott’s doctrine and con-
sider, say, the Radical u’Suillvan a suitable col-
league for the Conservative Abbott, or the Pro-
tectionist Melville for the Freetrade Burns. Pos-
sibly Mr. Abbott asserted the doctrine for his own
particular benefit. His position with regard to
the Robertson Ministry has been so curiously in-
consistent that it was worth while to adopt any
theory to account for it. He it was who tried to
oust Sir John Robertson before the late Cabinet
had appeared as a Ministry on the Treasury
benches. Next we find the aspiring Abbott
coquetting* with the leaders of the Coalition, in
which several of Sir John’s Cabinet were to be re-
tained.

Another instance showing the onmmeroial
development of Sydney is found in the new firm
of Jones, Lawson Brothers, and Co,, who have
taken the large buildings, Pomeroy-chambers, in
Castlereagh-street, where they begin operations
with a large and well-assorted stock of furniture,
carpets, and the general run of household require-
ments. Mr. L. Jones, late of Messrs. David Jones
and Co., gives his personal attention to the carpet
and window decorations, and Mr. J. R. Lawson,
late of the firm of James Lawson and Sons, will
undertake the cabinet department. Moreover, the
firm have secured the services of Mr. R, H. Brown,
for many years with Messrs, Lassetter and Co.,
Limited, to take charge of the bedstead and house-
hold ironmongery department. The combined
experience of practical men like these augurs well
for the success of one of the strongest “ teams ”

What is Socialism?
This is a question which has lain in our
Ind for many years. We do not yet feel our-
m, B competent to fully elucidate it. Socialism
has an extensive literature of its own. Its prin-
ioles, as we understand them, are co-tempora-
° ecus' with organised and recorded thought. They
11 e discoverable in the social laws of Moses as re-
a^rded in the Hebrew Scriptures, recognisable in
the philosophy of Plato, prominent in the moral
ode of Jesus of Nazareth, scattered through the
idealisings of More; and, later, glimmer amidst
the works of the French Encyclopaedists; and, in
modern times, find strong and coherent expres-
sion in the works of St. Simon in France, Lasealle
and Karl Marx in Germany, and, still more
recently, in pamphlets and brochures by Hyndman,
Morris. Campbell, and a rapidly Increasing host of
other writers in England. Our list is, doubtless,
as incomplete as our knowledge. Henry George,
however, is not a Socialist, although the designs,
tion has constantly been flung at him as a term of
obloquy. In a recent English publication, we ob-
serve, a Socialist writer remarks: “I object to
Henry George, not because he is a Socialist, but
because he Is not a Socialist.” The objection to
r e orge seems to be that he halts on the threshold
nf necessary reform, and, while offering a genuine
remedy for some of the evils of existing society in
his plan for national appropriation of all land
rentals, he errs in insisting that his remedy is a
nanacea- a cure for all social evils. The thorough-
going Socialist contends that, while George’s
remedy for the evils of landlordism is effectual for
those evils, there remain unhealthy relations be-

first place, then, we will explain
as well as we can what all the trouble is about.
People naturally want to know how there came
to be Socialism and Socialists at all: what their
complaint is, and what their objects. Briefly, the
complaint is that the existing organisation of
society is all wrong; that it is antagonistic to
natural laws; that it is an organised anarchy
maintained by force and fraud; that it combines
the maximum of human suffering with the mini-
mum of true personal advantage. In more exact
terms, the Socialists’ contention is that the in-
equalities of condition—of wealth and poverty-
created and maintained by existing legalised sys-
tems, are contrary to natural justice. Wealth, as
the exceptional advantage of individuals, they
sharply affirm is maintained solely by “The Bob-
bery of the Poor.
* • •
This is the subject of Mr. Campbell’s essay.
He finds his text among the Proverbs of Salomon,
“ Rob not the poor because he is poor.” This, Mr.
Campbell remarks, seems, on the surface, a very
extraordinary exhortation. Men are told not to
rob those who have nothing to be robbed of, and
they are apparently tempted to do so by this very
fact that there is something to rob. Mr Campbell
proceeds methodically. First, he demonstrates
that there are poor in England whose penury
seems irreconcilable with the idea that they have
not suffered foul play. He reviews the conven-
tional explanations of the existence of the des-
perately poor. “The poor are drinkers,” say the
Temperance people, “and so from temperance
platforms the people are told by the rich and well-
to-do . . . that they must really reform their
habits, and not leave their foul and desolate abodes
for the gin-shop with its glittering attractions.”
Again, they are thriftless. The grim satire of the
Earl of Derby, who enjoys an income exceeding
£170,000 a year, telling the poor of England, in a
speech at the Mansion-house, that it is tneir duty,
everyone of them, to live within their means and
lay by something every year, "as he, by much
restraint and self-denial, we are to suppose, con-
trives to do,” is pointed out. Next, the country
is over-populated I So cry the Malthuslans and the
advocates for emigration.
“ Perhaps,” writes Mr. Campbell, “ no one sur-
passes in insolence these two kinds of reformers.
Neither have the faintest idea, or apparent desire
\o obtain the faintest idea, of what number of
people the land of England can maintain, under the
conditions laid down by the Almighty Maker of
them and it. Get rid,” he cries, “ of every super-
fluous person in the land, by all means; but, per-
haps, before you talk any more about that, you
will have the goodness to find out and settle who
the superfluous person is.”
And he indicates pretty clearly that the super-
fluous person is more likely the idle non-producer
than the producer and worker. Again: “The poor
must be better housed,” cry another class. “ The
State must take the matter in hmd end provide
them with fit accommodation at the lowest pos-
sible rent. 1 ’ Of course, if land and wealth escape
thtir due proportion of taxation, this remedy
would simply burden the rather poor with the
cost of accommodation for the very poor. But
Mr. Campbell simply remarks;—
“ Very well. But will any one kindly inform me
what he thinks should be ‘the lowest possible
rent ’ a woman earning sixpence a day, or a man
one shilling and fivepenoe, can be expected to
pay ?”
Brushing aside these futilities, the writer cries,
“ What is the root of the matter then ? ” and
answers—
“ What but this : As a people we have forgotten
God. We have forgotten what Justice means.t
We have made and passed laws, not as to us
seemed just, but as seemed expedient. We have
sought, dealing man with man, not the just thing,
but simply the gainful. And as a net result and
outcome of it all, our laws and the accepted con-
stitution of society are such that there is going on
throughout the length and breadth of the land, in
thousands of the subtlest and cunnlngest of ways,
unchecked, unheeded—nay, applauded and ap-
proved of-that which the Hebrew sage of old
warned his fellow-man against—the robbery of
the poor by the rich, simply because they are
poor”
Next comes the demonstration. What have the
poor to be robbed of ? is an obvious inquiry at this
stage. The reply Is, in effect, they have their pro-
perty. The property of the poor ? Nonsense I
A definition is required. What, then, is property,
if the poor are among the propertied classes ? Mr.
Campbell professes to discover that economists
have not yet provided a definition, and proposes
one of his own. Property, he holds, is that which
Is proper to a thing, part and parcel of that thing,
and which cannot be dissociated from It without
it being destroyed in its distinctive nature. This
seems exact. We talk thus of the properties of a
magnet, of oxygen, of steel, and so forth. With
respect to a man, the term is evidently inapplic-
able to anything external to his own being.
“A man’s property, in its simplest meaning, is all
that rests within his own frame, all the powers of
body and mind which by nature are his. These
are all that a man can call ‘ his own,’ to which no
one but the Almighty Giver can have a prior
claim.”
This being “ private property,” what are its rights
and what is “common property?” Access to
such things and opportunities as are necessary for
the sustaining and renewing of soul and body.
That is the definition of natural rights, and of
common property. Nothing very monstrous, so
far.
♦ • •
Here, then, we have exact propositions.
Personal property is what belongs to each man’s
body and mind. Common property Is what Nature
has provided of material things which are neces-
sary for the sustaining of life. The natural rights
of man are simply the rights of access to
these material things—ln other words, the right
of living. Hence, the right of living being equal in
all men, the right of access to the material things
which are necessary for the maintenance of life is
equal to all. If this be admitted, then Is private
property in land condemned, since land is one of
the material things which have in them the life-
maintaining faculty, just as air and water have.
This is, In tact, Henry George’s main conclusion,
arrived at by a distinct line of argument.
• • «
But now comes a fresh departure. Sup-
posing the right of man to have access to material
things and to produce from them by his labour,
articles of use, were not denied him, George
holds that all would be well. The Socialists dis-
pute this. They say men might still be robbed
of their labour. They declare that men are so
robbed. And they assert that It is to denial of
their common rights and to robbery of their
labour that the hopeless poverty of the many is
jointly attributable. Here, therefore, we arrive
at the conflict between Labour and Capital which
Henry George regards as inessential, the poli-
tical economists of the old school as unavoid-
able, and the Socialists as criminal. At this point
we resume our quotations from Mr. Campbell:—
“ These conditions being thus recognised, a man
is entitled, by duly exercising his powers upon any
portion of this common property, to produce any
commodity or natural wealth in a form ready for
use. ... If another man desires a similar com-
modity, let him go to the common-wealth and pro-
duce it for himself; or, what is the same thing,
let him ask the other to change it for its due
equivalent.”
That due equivalent will be some other article
upon which an equal amount of labour has been
expended—the “ natural ” value being common to
both. This is honest exchange. No one is the
gainer over the other. No man can become
richer than another only to the extent that he la
more labourloua, more apt, or more thrifty.
Such persons will have, rightly, more claims than
others upon the general wealth, because embodied
in that wealth Is more of their labour, or more of
the fruits of their personal property, their
abilities.
• ■ ■
Now, as Capital Is simply stored-up Labour,
under these conditions the industrious, thrifty,
and able would be the capitalists of society. But
no one would be much richer than another. That
Is, considering a simple state of society. But In-
vention steps in, A machine is conceived and
constructed which can, with one man’s guidance,
produce what ten men’s labour was previously re-
quired to produce. This machine is (say) an im-
proved kind of loom for the spinning of cotton
shirting. The community has hitherto had all Its
wants supplied by ten men who have been paid in
proportion to their labour. The machine in
the hands of one man produces all that
Is required; and, as only one man is to
be maintained, the product can be ex-
changed at a cheaper rate. The other nine
spinners are starved out. The one man receives
nearly as much as heretofore had been paid to ten.
Cheapness creating demand, he erects a second
machine, and offers wages to one of the nine to
work it. As there are nine men anxious to get
the occupation, they bid against one another, and
he who offers to take the smallest proportion of
his true labour value gets the post. The machine
owner now has two looms at work, equal to twenty
men's labour, and expends only his own labour
and half the value of his hired assistant’s. He
pockets the other half as part of his gain. He has
thus robbed the poor because he is poor. But
his success excites rivalry. Other machines
f.re made, and competition between capital-
sts sets In. Society, then, is for .the first
time distinctly benefited by some saving
effected of the cheapness of production being all
lowed to purchasers. Meanwhile, a starvation
class is being created among the displaced weavers.
Want and hunger have begun their ravages. They
are followed by envy, recklessness, negligence at
work, thieving, despair. Society begins to require
gaols, police, and slave-drivers styled overseers.
And all this they have to pay for. Against their
gain by cheapness of production has to be set-off
their loss by demoralization and misery In their
midst.

An A merican paper (the Milwaukee Sun)
says;—“The late Mr. Swan, of Newcastle, N.8.W.,
was the strongest man of his day. In addition to
carrying about his own iveight ot 36 stone, ne
could lift a heavier weight than a "y« hc f m t a “
living. His residence was half-way between the
coal-mines and the town, and
laden with coal stuck in the road and the horses
were unable to extricate it, Sampson Swan, as t e
miners styled him. was sent fcr. He would dis-
mount from hia bicycle (I), lift the cart with ease,
and frequently, when the horses broke down
under their loads, in some of which cases they
would die of fatigue, Swan wouid put the eart on
his back and carry it into town without totting his
pipe go out. For these services Mr. Swan was
very well paid, and being a man of steady habits,
amassed a considerable fortune before his de-
mise.” Now, we have known Newcastle neigh-
bourhood for a good many years, but we have
been unable to discover Mr. Swan or anyone
acquainted with him. We begin to have a painful
feeling o’ 1 doubt on this subject. But we did once
meet a strong man in the person of a Victorian
storeman, James Harris, who was able to carry on
his back a hale of 100 Dundee woolpaeks (101 b.
each, besides the canvas covering and the hoop-
iron binding around them) a distance of 30 yards.
The Melbourne Argus is occasionally
almost humorous in its attacks on its bete noir—
Socialism. Thus, in referring to the ringleader—

says :—“Mr. H. M. Hyndman is a well-to-do gen-
tleman, with a reputation as a gourmand. One of
his nearest relatives is at present confined in a
lunatic asylum.” Now. if Mr. Hyndman, instead
of being a prominent Socialist, had been a rabid
Conservative, we venture to say [this statement
about lunacy in his family would never have been

being called a gourmand he would have been
described by the more delicate term gourmet.
Which side a man takes makes all the difference.
We venture also to fay that, if instead of posing
ai a True Bluo Tory, Mr. Henniker Heaton had
chosen the manly part, and stood up ai a Libera l ,
the Tory papers at home, instead of referring to
him as a “ distinguished colonist who traced his
ancestry bafir to the”-Do Battleaxe Burgoos, or
whoever they were—would have alluded to him as
a person born in the old-time penal colony of New
South Wales, believed to be descended from con-
vict ancestry, and bearing every mark of it in his
pirsonal appearance.” He would, in fact, have
got off lightly if they had not hinted that ha was
suspected of cattle-stealing and other crimes of an
even more infamous character.” It is a curious
world.
Sir Samuel Wilson occupies the manor-
house of the late Lord Beaconsffeld. For whom is
reserved the distinction of reclining in the late
carriages, controlling the late fiery steeds, and

Evening Would, which brought down Mr. llenty
with a crash after he had spent tecs of thousands'?
Mortimer Franklyn, who landed in Australia a few
years ago unknown, and, so to speak. sans a cent,
n&s been a “ wonder ”in his time. He has started
newspapers, been supported by baronets and our
“ oldest families,” and been driven about while
canvassing for ads. by a gorgeous tlunkey, who,
while waiting for his illustrious master, crossed
his arms in a way which smacked more strongly of
the ancien regime than anything we ever saw out of
the Panbourg St. Germain. This is how it reads:—
“ LiabiliMes, £20,014 83. IF; estimated assets,
£3B 085 ITs., giving a nominal surplus of £3071 Bj.
11l Of the debts, £7551 are secured on
real estate in St. Kuda and Melbourne,
£l3 387 17s. on personal property, and the
balance of £6067 is not secured. As to the
assets, the estimated value of the real property is
£10,700, The personal property, including the
plant and goodwill of the Federal Australian
and the Victorian Review, and 3450 shares in R.
Goldsbrough and Co., Limited, is valued at
£14,638 17e. ’ Running our ej e over it all in the
catalogue, we think of Ford’s lines:—
“ Glories of human greatness are but Ipleasing
dreams,
And shadows soon decaying—”
“ What a World it is I” But, after all, from one
standpoint, Mortimer is a lucky man. One
Greathead got a verdict for libel damages against
the Federal on the very day on which the pro-
prietor filed his schedule. Insolvency in Vi Aorta
completely releases the defendant in a libel action
from liability. Under the N.S.W. law, Franklyn
wouldn’t have been protected by his Insolvency.
He would, in default of paying the amount of
verdict and costs, have had to go to gaol for a
year.

Hon. Peter I alor,
Speaker of the Victorian
Assembly, has twice re-
fused a knighthood. Hon.
James Service, the retir-
ing Premier of Victoria,
has once refused a
knighthood. W© are not
surprised at Mr. Peter
Lalor s refusal of this
cheap bauble, because he
has always been a sound
democrat. He was one
of the miners who were
hunted at the diggings
in the early days of the
goldfields In the Southern
colony, and was among
those who were shot
down at the Eureka
Stockade, near Ballarat,
and the hon. gentleman
lost his arm in the con-
flict with the authorities,
who for a time set a price
on his head. Ex-Premier
Service never had any of
Mr. Lalor’s experiences,
but neither are we sur-
prised at that politician’s
refusal of a knighthood,
because there would be a
difficulty about ** Lady ”
Service, There is no
such difficulty in Peter
Lalor's way. That gentle-
man has long held the
opinion that democrats
should not accept titular
honours.
One member, at least, will not seek re-
election for the new Parliament in Tasmania. He
will be missed, for in debate he was a fearless and
independent member. But he violated a rule of
“Society’’—which runs thusly: “Sin not; but if
you sin do not get found out on pain of ostracism ”
—and “ Society " has made it hot for him. So he
will seek oblivion in a colony larger than that
which saw the meetingot: the first Eeleral Council.
A paper remarks “ that His Excellency
Lord Carington is gradually getting his hands
too full.” As a matter of fact, no ordinary pair of
hands could stand the wear and tear ol this con-
tinual shaking. One thing certa'n: His Excellency
will have given the affectionate grip business
best for a while, or at once order out a glover’s
clump. The Prince of Wales is kept pretty busy,
too, sometimes, when he’s out, but fI.R.H. takes
mighty good care only to shake hands with his
hat.
The Marchioness of Westmeath has just
been fined in Hammersmith Police Court 3s. 6d.
for being drunk and disorderly. It is almost un-
necessary to state that the Marchioness was with-
out either money or position in society, otherwise
she would either have got drunk in her own man-
sion and rolled about her own grounds, or have
been shepherded in her carriage by attentive
menials. Had she by any chance fallen into the
clutches of the law, seven or eight distinguished
phjsicians would have been in attendance to
swear that her ladyship was a sufferer from a form
of complaint with a fine long Latin name, and that
one of the effects of the malady was to make her
face red and her breath smell of drink. It is only
the other day, in fact, that a lady who did some
wholesale shoplifting in London was extricated by
medical testimony of that kind; and in Paris
almost simultaneously a lady tried shoplifting
lately and pleaded irresponsibility on the ground
that the idea of theft was “ suggested ” to her by a
malignant person with magnetic Influence over
her. Dr. Charcot and two other eminent doctors

Steals a loaf, or gets tipsy on gin, there is no

Debited with low thieving propensities or drunken
habits. The Marchioness of Westmeath, is now,
Semite her tinsel title, a wretched, friendless
waif and that explains why she was fined 3i. 6d
Her history is a queer one. She was a girl of
mean extraction, but endowed with great par-
annfll beauty, singularly pleasing manners, and a
winning address. The Marquis of Westmeath,
then a widower of 63 years of age, having recently
lost his first wife, a daughter of the Marquis of
Salisbury, saw the humble beauty of 19, and
married her in 1855 The usual May and December
consequence ensued. The Marquis’ estate was
small, and his Income was straitened for a person
of his rank, but he made a liberal settlement on his
w lfe and was very generous to her family.
In 1860. Lady Westmeath went to Dieppe, where
she made the acquaintance of Mr. George Edward
Chapman, son of the then British Consul at that
port, and became intimate with him. The follow-
ing year she lived with Mr. Chapman as his wife at
Matlock, in Derbyshire. When she returned to
her husband’s home in London, she continued her
intimacy with Mr. Chapman. Lord Westmeath’s
eyes were opened to his wife’s infidelity by her
Ladyship’s maid, who betrayed the guilty pair and
(rave Lord Westmeath a letter addressed by his
wife to her lover. This letter, which was signed
“ Cbickie,” spoke of the old husband ss “Fidget ”
and contained many endearing terms for Mr.
Chapman. A jury estimated the loss of the lady as
worth £5OO, and a divorce was granted The Mar-
quis re-married, and so did the quasi-Marchioness,
to a young ne’er-do-well. The cause of her arrest
was her appearance in High-street, Netting Hill,
drunk and flourishing a shlllelah, which in Court
she called her wand.
Physiognomical indications are by no
means infallible. Hon. James Service, the ex-
Victorian Premier, is an able man, yet his face
affords a remarkable illustration of the atavistic
peculiarity, indicating a reversion to the monkey
type. James can shitt his eyebrows and wag his
ears most beautifully, and he shifts and wags them
accordingly. Apart from the few alleged human®
so highly gifted in this direction, the monkeys and
the donkeysiare the only creatures that can wobble
their eyebrows in an exactly similar manner.
Darwin observes that in the animals mentioned
the slightest variations in the position of the ears
Eerve to express in the plainest manner variatior s
in their states of mind. While Mr. Service occu-
pied the chair as President of the late Federal
Council at Hobart, he. of course, could not orally
take part in the debates. But aurleularly he was
most eloquent. His ears, which are, of course, a
bit nearer to his brain than is his tongue, afforded
all the time a marvellously accurate index of his
mental condition from moment to moment. One
minute you’d see them standing straight up, the
fide of each constituting as awful a precipice as
that of the “ Organ Pipes” on Mount Wellington;
in a second or two a wave of feeling, which stole
fleetly around the convolutions of his brain would
lower his auricular appendages to, in sporting
parlance, half-cock, a position wherefrom they
would, as he listened to the orator in possession of
the floor, be modified from time to time by cur-
rents of pleasurable or painful sensation-currents
which toyed or dallied with the controlling mus-
cles of his head-flaps as the zephyrs toy with the
strings of an ASoiian harp or the stringy leaves of
the mournful she-oak. As the president of this
memorable Imperial Federation Chivoo—for that,
after all, was what it was turned into by Sam.
Griffith—was thus atavlstically gifted, how regret-
able is the oversight which found no vice-chair for
the Soudan donkey, the proper representative on
such an occasion of the great colony of N.B.W. I
“All the carnivora,” says Darwin, “fight with their
canine teeth, and all, so far as I have observed,
draw back their ears when feeling savage.” The
moral of this latter sentence will be obvious to
those whom the H onourable James Service meets
while “ doing Yurrup.”

A FRAGMENT.
AT THESE CRUEL WORDS ARABELLA PAUSED AND WEPT UPON HIS BOSOM.
back to the days of the Gladiatorial arena—when
we have done Flemington and Randwicb, have
seen Miller paste Foley, and gazed with delight! on
the gastronomic feats of Mr. Blbby, the por-
ridge-eater, and these things have no longer the
power to rouse within us either interest or ad-
miration, then, indeed, do we find in our own
hearts the echo of those words The man who, in
these times, can invent a new sensation is a public
OVER A CUP OF TEA.
MRS. GRINDERSON: “DO YOU KNOW, MRS, SNIPPER TOM AND I HAD SUCH A DE-
LIGHTFUL DRIVE. WE WENT TO GLADESVILLE. TO VISIT THE ASYLUM. IT
WAS LOVELY. AND (with great animation) OH, MRS. SNIPPER, YOU OUGHT TO GO

THERE, YOU COULD EVER HAVE GOT AWAY!”
benefactor. All honour to those, therefore,
whose luminous brains evolved the happy idea of
utilising the thrilling incidents and prurient details
of a criminal ciurfc for the edification and enjoy-
ment of a pleasure-seeking public. We have
all wept over the wrongs and sufferings of the
innocent in melo-drama, and rejoiced at the ulti-
mate discomfiture of vice and triumph of virtue;
but we have gone away with au unetftiified feeling
that the thing was only acted and not real, and
because we knew that in all probability the
pretty heroine of the piece and the heavy villain
were then supping side by side on tripe and
onions. We were tired of this simulating of the
passions; we longed for something real. We got
it. Ten months had elapsed since the finding of
the dead body of a man in a far Northern river
of N.S.W. Tremendous interest was felt at
the time, from the mystery which enveloped the
whole affair. When found, the face was so de-
composed as to be past recognition. No one was
missing. Who, then, could tell in what direction
to seek the murderer when the victim and, o f
course, the motive were totally unknown ? Hun-
dreds of theories were propounded, but nothing
had been discovered, and the mystery was gradu-
ally and reluctantly relegated to the undiscover-
ablos. The town had resumed its normal quiet-
ness, when like a thunderclap came the news
that the murderer was discovered and arrested.
Here, then, was the grand opportunity, and
luckily, ihe master-mind to grasp it. A remand
for a week was applied for and granted. This
gave everyone time to hear of the case, and the
management time to make their preparations-
The prisoner was to be tried on Tuesday, and on
Monday it was made known that every accom-
modation would be provided for the public, that
as the courthouse was email, couit would beheld
outside, so that all might see and hear the case
tried. Accordingly on Monday morning a large
sail was borrowed and converted into an awning
to shelter the stalls and pit, while chairs were re-
served for ladies on the verandah beside the
Bench, Towards 10 o'clock some hundreds of
people had assembled. Much satisfaction was ex-
pressed at the consideration that had been shown
for their comfort, and, soon after, the show com-
menced. Then our cup of joy was full. To sit
there, sheltered from tie rays of the burn-
ing sun, a nice light breeze blowing off
the river, and creating a musical ripple
at our very feet, and then and there
to gaze our fill on a real, live murderer. A man
whose hands had (it was alleged, anyhow) been wet
with warm human blood, who had chopped the
back of a man s head into pulp with a tomahawk,
and afterwards put the body in a bag, tied a bag of
heavy stones to one leg, and, a la Nicholis and
Lester, thrown 1 h 3 whole into the river, and all be-
cause he’d caught the man kissing his wife or some-
thing. This was what we had sighed for. What
pleasure, too, to look at and listen to the accom-
plica who saw the deed committed, standing in the
witness-box giving all the horrible details of the
c ime. Ob, it was glorious I There were a number
of ladles present, and how they relished all the
particulars ;of the little domestic deputes, the hus-
band’s jealousy, the endearing epithets born of
suspicion, how that suspicion became a certainty
by But there is a good deal I cannot repeat, yet
to the credit of the ladies be it recorded, they
would not allow any fake delicacy to prevent
their enjoyment to the full of the treat that had
been so generously provided for them. Perhaps
the most delightfully thrilling scene was when
the wife (who had been arrested that morning
as accessory after the murder) was first brought
forward, hysterically crjing and shrieking, pro-
testing before God her innocence one moment,
and praying for her two children the next. It was
better than even Pomeroy or Dargon, and only
for the hippy cor caption of an open-air trial, not
more than one-fifth of the people could have en-
joyed the spectacle. Too much, therefore, cannot
be said in favour of the idea and its promoters.
Everything passed off without a hitch during the*
two days the trial lasted, the only subject for re-
gret being in the faet thi t the prisoners could only
be c mmitted, for there is no doubt that could
they have been found guilty, and hanged on the
spot, every one would have been much better
pleased, and it would have made a splendid closing
scene to so refined and elevating an entertain-
ment.
This seems rather a lame and impotent
conclusion to what promised to be a lively elope-
ment. A young fellow at Orange, named Billy
Freeman (well off) cleared out with Alice Taylor,
one of whose misfortunes was to be under 16.
Billy was, of ciurse, “pinched” promptly, and to
get out of the trouble married the girl on the
morning of the trial. The bride was much
cheered by the people on leaving, and it
was remarked that the groom appeared to bear
the happiness thus suddenly thrust upon him with
much serenity and composure.
A curious argument is attributed to Dr.
L iwellin, of Melbourne Hospital. As an example
of the evil effects following the segregation of
patients suffering from different complaints, he is
reported to have said that there were now attend-
ing the Melbourne Hospital students " who had
not the faintest idea as to what erysipelas was,”
now that the erysipelas patients had Deen removed
to a separate building. Further, that students
were not afforded the same facilities for instruc-
tion) in special wards or hospitals that they en-
joyed in a general ward or a large hospital.” Up
toj this we always laboured under the idea that
it was for the cure of the sick that such institu-
tions; were established, and that aggregation or
segregation should be followed solely with a view to
give patients a chance for their lives. But we live
and learn. If greater facilities are afforded the stu-
dents by sandwiching- erysipelas patients between
fever ones why—sandwich them. The mortality
will increase, but that is the sufferers’ business.
To classify inmates and so oblige young saw-
boneses to leave the scarlet-fever ward if they
wish to study the symptomotology of measles is
outrageous.
Nellie M. (St. Leonards) asks for a simple
way to crochet a round-table cover. This query
was evidently intended for the Sydney Town and
Country Jernil, wh'ch gives some very lively
reading in this business every week, although
most of the tales lack plot, and are just a trifle too
indelicate. It’s a long time now since we thumbed
theth ead and needle, Nellie, but as near as we
can recollect you should work nine stitches,
turn back, two stitches in third bar, half
right and left, three chain, B to Qlth, ch. t

and fasten to X P Ith. loop, and turn back, keeping
the red in baulk; carefully remove every particle
of fat and garnish with half an ounge of delirium
tremens au naturel, work two stitches, andante
pizzicato, white to play and mate in three stitches,
straddle your partner’s blind, simmer gently for
half an hour, and finish off with small caps or non-
pareil. That’s our advice, Nellie.
Here is an ingenious denouement“ A
few days later Mr Phillip Looseley received the
following epistle from his uncle, the peer:— 1 Sir,—
You have behaved like a scoundrel. You have
betrayed a trusting girl by a most rascally and
despicable trick. There is but one atonement in
your power. You must marry Miss Greener
within a fortnight, or I will disinherit you —Your
uncle, Nobrowav.’ Mr. Looseley smiled sardoni-
cally as he read this laconic epistle, and, after due
deliberation, he answered it thus:—‘My Lord,—l
beg to acknowledge your letter of the —th inst.
I,entirely demur to the statement contained
therein, and 1 must respectfully decline to accept
your suggestion that I should marry Miss Greener.
I am sorry that you should have thought fit to
enforce your behests by a threat. It may have
escaped your memory that it is not in
your power to prevent my succeeding in
course of time to the family title and estates pro>-
vlded that I outlive you-a contingency which I
cannot help regarding as more than proba-
ble—Your obedient nephew, Philip Looseley.’
But Mr. Looseley's satisfaction was somewhat
short-lived Just a fortnight later he received a
triangular paefcet, tied up with white ribbon, and
a note to the following effect:— ‘ Dear Sir,—l beg
to inform you that 1 yesterday married Miss
Greener. You will thus perceive that your pro-
spect of succeeding to the family title and estates
is not quite so certain as you appear to imagine.
It will. However, doubtlefs be a profound consola-
iion to you to reflect that, in any case, either you
or your son must succeed to the position I now
hold.—Sincerely yours, Norroway.’ Of course,
everyone said that Lord Norroway was mad; but
he, at all events, succeeded In disinheriting his
nephew, for the child was a son, and Mr. Looseley
realised tomewhat too late that, for once in a way,
he had been a trifle too clever.”

We read that the broken-hearted young
woman who jumped off the Clifton suspension
bridge (the highest in England), and escaped
almost unhurt, received three offers of marriage
while in the hospital. Very likely, those suitors
were circus proprietors, and each wanted a wife
whom he could load into a cannon and fire against
a brick-wall for the delectation of a large and
discriminating audience.

ing from early indiscretions, over indulgences,
over brain work, etc , etc., have sought in vain for
some remedy which would restore them to that
full vigour and perfect manhood which they have
been deprived of. Year after year they have
placed themselves under the care of some so-called
specialist, or some great remedy company, and
after months of their treatment, involving pounds
of expense, they awake to the sad but true fact
that they are not only no better in health, but that
perhaps years of hard earned savings have been
actually thrown away. For the last year or more
still another class of advertisers have come into
the field. Men who claim that they will send pre-
scriptions free to the afflicted public. Rut what
does the patient receive on sending ? Certainly a
prescription, but one that nobody but the adver-
tiser himself can fill, and for doing which he wants
so much money as the case may be And this is
his prescription free. Some five years ago several
leading medical men in London knowing the
impositions suffered by this class of patients, and
understanding the reluctance always felt by them
for consulting regular practitioners, determined
to form a company and obtain some certain and
safe cure which they could place before the pub-
lic. With this object in view, three years were
spent in the most careful study, and treatment of
all classes of these diseases all over Europe, and
from this vast experience they are now enabled to
give to the world, a medicine which is simply cer-
tain in its effects, and will in every case effect a
safe, sure, and speedy cure. For two years the
company has been before the public in London,
and on the continent, and to-day they have many
thousand letters in which the writers state that in
their case a permanent cure has been effected. In
the United States where the company has only
been established for a year, the same wonderful
success has been met with, and the directors feel
certain that in coming before the many thousands
of afflicted in Australia, the same will be the case
here. The medicine is packed in caskets, and put
up in different grades and forms, to meet all
classes of cases, each casket containing two months’
treatment (and under this time no case can be per-
manently cured by any medicine in the world)
Caskets are sent to patients free of charge on re-
ceipt of price, which is £3, securely sealed from
observation, with full directions as to treatment,
i and in every case with the distinct understanding,
that where a permanent benefit is not derived the
money will be cheerfully refunded. In ordering,
patients are requested to give a full and distinct
description of all their symptoms, so that wo can
be sure of sending the proper remedy. All letters
are sacredly confidential, and all orders should be
sent by Post Office Order, registered letter, or
bank draft, adlreseed to

Now, may the Fates preserve us from ever
being mixed up in a murder case. It was the mis-
fortune of one Frank Howarth to be employed as
man-servant in the establishment of Mr. Beach,
farmer, of Pettavel (Vic) Beach was shot dead
one night under mysterious circumstances. Both
Mrs. Beach and the man Howarth were put on
their trial for tho “ Pettavel tragedy,” but were
discharged. There was in fact, not sufficient
evidence to connect them with the crime. After
the trial Howarth married and settled down in
the neighbourhood of Pettavel, while Mrs. Beach
lived on quietly in the old house. The crime was
well-nigh forgotten by the public, when there
erme a new and energetic Superintendent of
Police to Geelong, who conceived the idea of
covering himse'f with glory by re-arresting
Howarth and Mrs. Beach on the old charge.
He arrested those two country people in the
dead of night. All hours of the day were
at, the policeman's disposal, but he preferred
taking the ‘‘prisoners” from their beds. The
magistrates before whom this second charge was
made discharged the suspects without waiting to
hear their defence. Howarth naturally enough
brought an action against of the
law. Heaven knows why—his suit was unsuccess-
ful. And now the miserable wretch is to stand
one more trial. For perjury. He swore he was
handcuffed after he was taken from bis bed, and
he wasn't handcuffed.

“0. Paton As you say, the Jews almost
always dress their little boys in sailor suits. That
is to discourage them from becoming sailors when
they grow up. However, very little discourage-
ment usually appears necessary...."M. Jack-
son”: If you expectorate freely (or at all) while
smoking, leave off using tobacco. The abnormal
activity of the salivary glands is the precursor of
retching, which, in its turn, precedes vomiting —
“Elizabeth Bay”: Parliament will very likely
have a deal to say concerning Colonel Spalding,...
“Indignant” writes : “Is it tiue that the S.A.
authorities offered the Government two batteries
of Hallelujah Lasses to accompany the Contingent
to the Soudan, on condition that the Biloela girls
should be permitted to do the garrison service in
the meantime ?”—Yts ;it is quite true "D.C.”:
Letter ani paper equally acceptable
It may have been a strange affair, but not
half 80 strange as the metre of your
V erse “ Dyspepsium ”: If you always write
that way when you are ill, we hope you
Will get ’em again as soon as possible
"8.P.”: Policemen wear gleves because they
have to handle larrikins “A. Muston”: The
point is that an 11 independent ” man is often so-
called because he is dependent on his rich wife
“ C.C.” (Brisbane): It was held over for illustra-
tion...." Coach ”: No, “PoetcTnascitur non fit"
does not mean " the poet creates but does not
make.” The litoral translation is " a poet is not
fit to be born.” It was written by a man who had
read something of Douglas B. V. X. Y. Z. Bladen's.
..." Jac-Kass ”: We don't whether you are seven,
as you say, or 17. Your conceit points to the greater
age, your humour to the more infantile period....
“H.0.D.”: Overlooked last issue... "Cuthbert”:
Thanks for the yarn, anyhow " Pagin’’:
Funny and forcible but we musn’t
“ J.S.” (Armidale): Thanks—“ T. 8.”: The reason,
dew sir, why we spell His Excellency's name with
one "r” is that we thus save an “ r.” By the way,
how can you spell “ Smith ” with two " r's ?” If
you say any more we’ll rpell Carington phoaeti-
cally with a preliminary "K.”... "L.S J.”: The
name of “Dr.” Tucker does not appear on the
N.S.W. Medical List “A. Jamieson”: Good
looks do not a racehorse make "Abigail’s
Friend”: Your Parliamentary platform is admir-
able. But you might just as well go to the coun.
try with a proposal that no one should be “ run
in” for anything; that all policemen executing
their duty should be hit in the eye; that all
police stations should be granted spirit licenses,
and that the Supreme Court judges should be
sent to gaol during the vacation.. .“ J.J.”: N 0....
"Wager”: The amount of the French National
Debt now exceeds that of Eogland by several
million pounds sterling —“ Charles Marks”:
Nonsense, The opinion of the average doctor on
such a subject isn't worth a cent. No doctor
can with certainty pronounce as to the sanity
of a criminal. For example: A youth was con-
victed in Tasmania a year or two ago of murder
committed in a lit of rage. The doctors said
he was sane, and he was executed accordingly
At the post mortem it was found that the criminal’s
skull-cap was almost perforated by one of the
mo:t deadly and widespread diseases known to
humanity. Not a word about this has ever
appeared in the papers. When you super-add the
fact that there can often be seen, even under the
microscope, no indication whatever of disease in
the brain of a man who, during his lifetime, had
for many years undoubtedly been insane, what can
one think of the value of doctors’ evidence as to
sanity in the case of a man sentenced to death?....
“ Citizen Soldier ”: The fact of the officer referred
to having paid you £5 only for the article men-
tioned, and afterwards charged the Government
£lO, is no doubt a matter which should be
thoroughly exposed, but as N.S.W. judicial affairs
stand at present, no one, except young Vander-
bilt, could afford to do the ftate that service.
Beaumarchais evidently had our lovely libel laws
in his mind’s eye when he made the censor in the
“ Marriage of Figaro ” say—" Provided you do not
speak in your writings either of the Government,
of religion, of politics, of office-holders, of respect,
able corporations, of the opera, of the other
theatres, or of anybody who is connected with
anything, you can print freely everything—
under the inspection of two or three censors....
"Cricketer”: Your suggestion that if Boyle be
selected as the fourteenth man in the cricket
team which is going to England, it will be a
Boyle over,” is beneath contempt. Besides, you
don't know what you are talking about.. .
"Tyro”: Yes. When you ask if when sending
contributions to us you should write only on one
side of the paper. You can If you please. It is ail
be same to the dustman "Xanthos”: What is
°ur opinion of your poem ? Well, to be candid,
after, reading it we regretted having written
against solitary confinement. You may guess what
our opinion is from this "Curious”: Yes. An
entry of “ Chinamen’s B me* ”.is a common thing
|n the Custom-house, though there is no duty on
em. We think this is a mistake. Import duties
are charged upon Chinamen, then why not export
Upon their remains? We suggest this as a

Mr. Gladstone, with his hatchet, was in the thick
of the riot, and, doubtless, picked the pockets of
Lord Salisbury.” From the very largo amount of
this distressing kind of “copy ” that sees print an-
nually there must certainly be a demand for it*
Mr. F. M. Darley, Q.C. professed a partiality for
this sort of literature, considering it to be “ whole-
some fun—an expression that is now historic. The
learned gentleman did not apparently take time
to consider that all fun must be wholesome fun;
since did a joke become unwholesome there
would at once cease to be any “ fun ” in it. To
return, however, to “ Angles,” he had the
reputation once of being able to set the table
in a roar. His little bush yarns “took well,” let
us tell you, all ending, as they did, in italicised
lines, such as "with the aid of his shoe he had been
) trying half the morning to ram his big toe through
a five shilling-piece." That made "him” late for
the wedding’, and told of a practical joke. There
la not, however, a joke of any kind in
now; ” hut facetious correspondents occasionally
ring in on him, as having “taken place at the
station,” a number of pastoral fossils which he
gravely reproduces in the Australasian. Truth
copied one of these not long ago, as a specimen
of the humour peculiar to the Australian colonies,
but the paper was hardly distributed before the
item was claimed by a man up North—probably a
descendant of Ham. The fact is we are tired of
f 'Angles ’ and his snug little column. He is a good
fellow, and his “ Talk on Change ” is a good thing*
But one may have too much of a good thing.
Suppose he alter the titte to “ Talk Unchanged.”

Journalism in Melbourne is to some people
nearly as lucrative as stevedoring. Three members
of the new Victorian Ministry have been writers
for the Age— viz., Mr. Deakin, Chief Secretary
and Minister of Water Supply; Professor Pear-
son, Minister of Education; Mr. Dow, Minister
of Lands and Agriculture. In addition to
these are about a dozen journalistic candi-
dates for M.L.A -ship, moat of whom seem
to have a good chance of being elected. With
such a galaxy of talent as this a Parliamentary
organ might be started to supply a long-felt want
—the want of members to have their speeches
reported in full—each member to write out his
own oration with whatever comments he chose to
make. We should then, probably, he gladdened by
reading something like this:—" You might have
heard a pin drop when that second Pitt the younger,
the ever-eloquent Chief Secretary, rose to, &c.:’
“ Profound silence fell upon the House when the
quick-witted and able Attorney-General got up in
his place to, &c.:’ “ The House was hushed. There
was a pause of delighted expectancy. Then sil-
very-soft as the notes of a lover’s lute in lands of
old romance, the clear, sweet accents of a deli-
cately-modulated voice thrilled through the
charmed Assembly. It was the voice of that bril-
liant and polished scholar, the Minister of Educa-
tion, &o.” “But what is this we hear? Whose
voice is it that; peals through the building and
wakes the solemn echoes? Whose but that of the
genial and much-travelled Minister of Lands and
Agriculture—gifted alike to use the flowing pen
and voice the flowing phrase-the true and original
writer of the larticle on the Great Sharon Case,
none others genuine, &c.” We do wish they would
adopt Jour suggestion. If they do we are free to
maintain they will..’produce the funniest paper in
the world.

The following gay and airy advertisement
appeared in the Melbourne Age a short time ago :—
“I, Thomas Clinch, will not be responsible for my
debts.—Thomas Clinch.” There it is, short and
sweet. There is no beating about the bush with
Mr. Clinch. He goes straight to the point and in
ten words wipes out all his obligations to the
human race and starts once more a free man able
to “look the whole world in the face” quit© as
well as, and we daresay a good deal better than,
the Village B'aoksmith. Mr. Clinch, your hand!
we admire you. Would we could imitate you.
But, alas I Conscience make cowards of a small
minority of us, and, as yet, we belong to that
ignoble few. We do not despair, however, of being
able to break with them one of these days and
bask In the balmy atmosphere of irresponsibility
which surrounds you. Some day we may make a
present of our conscience to a member of Parlia-
ment. A conscience of any kind—even ours—
wifi be a curiosity to him. Its workings will be a
source of as much unfailing wonder to him as
those of a watch are said to be to the untutored
savage. In the meantime, here are four lines for
you, Mr. Clinch.—
Their debts to pay while others pinch.
From yours you are a festive flincher;
Your creditors are settled, Clinch,
For you have given them a clincher.
T' is was pretty straight, and all in a
whisper, as the eloquent and learned member was
about to depart. “ I do not really think, my lord,
it wouli be advisable to further extend the radius
of your affability’s sunshine—” “ You don’t, eh ?”
said Lord Carington, pulling his moustache. “I
do not, ray lord! These people—oh, capital people
—capital!— are just the least bit impressionable.
You cannot begin drawing in the horns of courtesy
too soon. If not, your Excellency will live to see
the Royal Guest ushered In by John Davies and
Maohowlem, M.L.A., on the dais, with a comb in
one hand and a quart of lavender water in the
other, ready for any emergency.
» - *
“From personal observation,” remarked
Lord Carington, at Sydney Hospital meeting, “ he
was able to testify to the kind and skilful treat-
ment of the nurses.” There is something touch-
in this kindly bid to please us, and we are really
grateful, but,‘[sentimentality apart, we ask what
ho could have personally observed in the treat-
ment of the nurses, when, on his entrance to a
ward, on the day he skipped through the place,
those unfortunate young women were ranged up,
near to the door, like soldiers, and were kept at
’tention till his Excellency had departed. If he
had come, in disguise, a few minutes before (there
would be some difficulty, we apprehend, in dis-
guising his Excellency’s legs) the noble lord might
possibly have seen something. For, perhaps, up
to the last minute the nurses were hard at it tying
up refractory jaws with invisible tape, End
muffling death-rattles. It is very pleasant. To
finish up the par. we have only to assure Lord
Carington that since he has gained the hearts of
the people (and ours), an ordinary knife will do.
He need not mind, in future, laying on the “jam ”
with a paling.
• • *
“Her Majesty the Queen has subscribed
£SOO to the relief of the unemployed in London.”
“ Now, boys,” said Lord Carington, sum-
moning his four aides about him, on receipt of Sir
John Robertson’s communication, “ what do you
think about the dissolution ? ” The four aides-de-
camp turned eight reproachful eyes upon their
chief, and a long silence was broken by Lord
Bertie saying, hysterically: “We thought you
knew us better I 1 Think,’ indeed.” And the ill-
used quatrain filed off into the bungalow; but
they have received such a shock that it was as
much as they could do (they said) to open the
side-board.

Tbe world is going round, and no mistake.
Hero’s the Peak Downs Telegram (N.Q.) incor-
porating itself with the Copperfield Miner;
and, now if you please, they have “ Nick-nacks,”
by Peter Palings, who takes for his motto, “ I am
the very pink of courtesy,” and immediately
plunges into the relation of a story, of which the
following is an extract ‘ I say, who the D—l
is there?’ ‘lam.’ ‘Who the h 1 are you?’
‘My nams is (the C.T. mentioned his name).’ ‘Do
you know that’s my room.’ ‘ls it’(calmly). ‘lf
you will not come out I will pull you out.’ ‘ Como
and try it.’ ‘Will you open the d—d door?’
* No.’ ‘ I’ll pull your and 1 nose when I get in,’ ”
&c. At the time we shed the refulgent light of our
genius on the Miner there were no “ Nick-nacks”
about it, nor any Peter either, hut there [were any
Job’s quantity of palings. We knew the Miner
wouldn't last long after we left, and are glad it
didn’t. A copy of that journal, edited by our
successor, came into our hands in Brisbane, and —
well, it’s not to run the man down—we’d be the
last to—hut of all the audacity I Not only a leader
on the “ Burning Political Questions of the Hour,’>
but a war telegram, which was set up in small
ype and squeezed in under an ad. relating to sar-
dines, and which ran—“ Information is to hand
that in a battle on the Kloptlc plateau, the Grand
Duke Murphy’s Army has been completely routed
by that of Solomon Bosher.”
The passengers of the wrecked steamer
Murray arrived at Sydney by the Rosedale the
other day, and were hearty in health, but melan-
choly in mind. And when they read later that
“ Only a portion of the passengers’ luggage has
been recovered,” they merely murmured “By
whom, we wonder ?”
“ A woman is a good deal like an accor-
dion,” says a French writer. “You can draw her
out all right, but the music begins when you [try
to shut her up.”
She went to the priest“ Sure, Fay ther,”
she said, “I’m in the court, ana they’ve got two
liars against me, and I’ve only got one. Can ye
And me another ? ”
At the first blush, it would seem as if the
Llthgow CoilierF Disaster Relief Committee were
an ass. We read “ Nearly £IOO had been sub-
scribed, but it was not considered advisable to
publish the names of the aonois until more sub-
scriptions had been received.” Now, if they were
to publish the list, and head it, “ Under the patron-
age of Lord Carington,” the money would roll in.
No, now we come to think, that is not so certain.
It is a collection for charitr, not for a “Patriotic
Fund,” and there are no titles or other glittering
aids to liberality hanging on to it.
Alderman Long became Mayor of Penrith,
N.S.W . the other day. she occasion fetched a lot
of autobiography out of him. Here are a few modest
little hits that the Press should reach out for
without coughing. Mayor Long, after telling his
audience that he is 50 years of age and a native of
the colony, said that “ he awed his education to
the Press of the colony, and considered that great
credit was due to tbeir teachings.” He, no doubt,
slapped his exoansive bosom at the close of this
period. Then he smiled around, and added: “He had
had many differences with the local Press, but he
hoped that ft would prove better and be of more
enlightenment la the future,” First the Press
teaches Alderman Long. Now Alderman Long
wants to teach the Press. That’s always the way.
Following the example of Mr. Joseph
Zaehnsdoif, who lately bound two Elzevir editions
in human skin, another London binder has exe-
cuted an order to encase a copy of Hans Holbien’s
“Dance of Death” in the same ghastly integu-
ment, certainly a very appropriate covering for
this work. These are not the only instances, how-
ever, in which the casing of the “ human form
divine ” has been utilised. Jn the library at Mex-
borough House, near Methley, Yorkshire, there
were formerly two books, Sir John Cheek's “ Hurt
of Sedition ” and Braithwait’s “ Arcadian Prin-
cess,” both hound in the prepared skin of Mary
Bateman, “the Yorkshire witch,” who was exe-
cuted early In the beginning of this century for
murder, but these were among those which dis-
appeared during the cataloguing of the library
for sale, when one of the lormer Earls of Mex-
borough was iu difficulties, Yet another instance.
Iq Paris a small book was shown by a dealer, who
solemnly avowed it was bound in a portion of the
skin of the notorious Louvet de Couvray, and
which he valued at 1000 francs, and lor authentica-
tion of which he produced a long pedigree.
MORE MEDALS, OK, GLORY V. GRUB.
A tale I tell, a song I sing, of Solon Ctcsar Pluck,
Whose gorgeous dreams but travestied his cruel
dally luck ;
pursued by fate, ipreyed .on by care, h’s was a
mournful lot,
Cursed were his basket and his store, his pannikin
and pot.
50 work found he, none would employ this poor
unhappy lad,
Whose boots and hat were grinning at the ragged
clothes he had:
Who lived on scraps he pilfered from the swill
cans of the pubs,
Despite the filthy taste and smell, and scullions’
Jeering snubs.
If dry o’erhead and underfoot, within the drear
Dom'ain
He had a fav’rita sleeping plaoe; if damp or
threat’nlng rain,
Some building going up he sought, where in
the shaving shed,
prom dark till dawn he slumbered on, of all bis
troubles rid.
And so the days rolled on until the clarion of, war
Was sounded by Plain Bill, who then was autocrat
and Czar,
The heart of Solon Ctcsar Pluck so swelled within
his breast,
It burst the only button off which bound h'm in
his vest.
Enlisted then, well-fed, his dreams were now of
high martial fame,
Of Arab chiefs beheaded, of Arab "steeds made
tame,
Of lovely ladies’ lustrous eyes, which beamed
through gauzy veils,
And looked with favour unconcealed on Pluck of
New South Wales.
Alas 1 those dreams were vain, for he, instead of
shedding gore,
With pick and shovel daily up the Nubian desert
tore ;
Instead of captivating hearts, he chased high-
smelling goats,
And never saw a desert steed worth feeding
upon cats.
Returning home with heart elate, he cried, “No
laurels twine
My brows; no scalp-lock, trophy, nor Soudan goat
is mine,
ut sill my bravery was great, I did not lack the
will
Some easy billet will, I know, be found me by
Plain Bill I”;
He landed in the rain, took ill, soon all his pay was
spent,
Nor did the “ Patriotic” Fund disburse him one red
cent;
And now, enfeebled by disease, he no employment
found,
No first-floor lodgings his, they still were on the
cold, cold ground.
Bat then a tale cheered his poor heart, of medals
coming out,
He strained his feeble lungs to give what proved
his final shout;
“A medal mine, of goldl” he cried, “I’ll quickly
put It in
The charge of ‘ Mo,’ my uncle, for I sadly want
some tin.
“I’ll have a feed, a long, deep drink, once morel 11
sleep in bed;
I’ll have a bath, a shave. I’ll paint the blooming
city red ;
Once more I’ll walk well-dressed and clean, the
busy haunts of men,
My had luck gone, I’m sure to get a decent billet
then.”
The longed-for day arrives, and now to where the
“ Guvnor ” stands,
Limps slowly one, whose rags are held together
with his bands ;
His hollow cheeks and sunken eyes, each fleshlcss,
bony limb,
Bear evidence Sham “ loyalty ” has been the death
of him.
The medal his, he falters, his white cheeks flush,
then pale,
Fades out the joy-glint fnm his eyes, his lips emit
a wail;
“This medal mine,” he stammers out, “ this paltry
thing of load,
‘I can't pop this, for me no food no clothes, no
drinks, no bed 1”
He falling back expired, and thus was cut off
Private Pluck,
Who longed to he a hero, but had most infernal
luck.
Who, fooled, betrayed and moneyless, cried long
and loud for bread,
But bread was dear, and so he got a medal in its
stead.
A Reine of Plenty.

The clouds of trouble lift,

Of death be no more funky,
For plenty reigns throughout the land—
Thanks to your monarch’s “ monkey.”
At last has the Millennium come
To bless the British Isles—
The voice of each complainer’s dumb—
His frowns are smoothed to smiles;
Those blankets he can now take out
That long lay pledged with “ nunky,”
And all this change is brought about
By Queen Victoria’s “monkey.”

“Janet Pride” is now the bill at the
Sydney Opera House, and judging from the way
an expectant public rolled up on the first nisrht, it
is a bill which will be amply receipted. O nly a
couple of dozen seats in the circle awaited our
choice on Saturday night, and ot thrse several
were taken by Dte-cotners. “Janet Pride” was
written by Dion Boucicault, but wo risk a libel
action in making the statement At what period
of his life the drama was concocted, we are not
able to say, but he probably penned it at times —
aay, when going to the funeral of a friend, or
waiting at the station for a mother-in-law—when
he was unusually depressed, and not quite himselt,
fv>r it ha ,- dly shows his hand in aslnglo lineor char-
acter. Certainly, it was written before he came to
Australia, for the business relating to this part of
the g obe is worked uo In a style mat would com-
mend itself to the habitues of a London theatre—
and to them alone.

Miss Ellen Beaufort gets nearly all the
terragic business. In the prologue she is dis-
covered waiting for her husband, who is painting
the town red with the assistance of a few kinlred
spirits and a bowl of nunch. Her (and his) child is
coiled up in a cr*.d e in the room, and being
afl'llcted with low lever, stands a fair show ot
floating away to the delicious by-and-bye if a pre-
scription whicn the doctor writes with oneflourish
of his pencil is not made up and administered that
night. As the husband has collared every stiver
in the house tor the purpose of carminating the
city, Janet Pride (Mls» Beaufort) does not see how
she is to satisfy the rapacious druggist, so she
bundles the babe off to me Found mg hospital,
and then falls liteless at the feet of her
husband, who is returning from a cate, full
of melody and milk punch. Miss Beaufort s
fall here is a fine piece of work. She grips her
little No 5 hands above her head-piece, and then,
with a shriek that has ail the tender pathos of the
curlew’s lugubrious song and the melancholy of a
dingo’s nocturne, she describes the segment of a
circle which has her little beaters for its centres
The whole house applauded the feat, and it was
not because they thought that was the conclusion
of the piece either—it was sheer aomiration of her
histrionic gymnastics. Miss Beautort was worth
watching mroughout, especially in the somnam-
bulistic scene. where she wanders in, attired in a
bewitching robe-dc-nuit of marvellous construc-
tion; but Janet Pride is a difficult part to play,for
the business in the last act—the trial scene-can
hardly be made anything but moos heroic, even
by a Terry or a Bernhardt. Miss Beaufort is a lady
whom nature intended to wear an expansive
smile— her features era specially constructed for
it. Strictly speaking, she is not absolutely op-
pressed with a marvellous beauty, but still she
might be considered beautiful by some persons,
if she were a little otherwise than as she is at
present.
A large amount of the weight of the piece,
and the heaviest part of it, too, falls upon H. N.
Douglas, the Richard Pride. He is better iu this
than in any former role we have seen him take. In
the first act, when he takes the part of a drunken
man, he Is better than he has ever appeared when
pourtraymg virtue and sobriety (probably he has
attended asuburban municipal council and studied
from life), and although in the prologue he hung
almost as lovingly o« to the final syllable of his
words as a defeated Treasurer in N.B. W. hangs on
to the dlbbs of office, be improved as the piece
progressed, until finally he parted with the word-
sound as gaily as a politician parts with aH his
principles (if he happens to have any) when he
sees a chance of chipping in with a Coalition
Cabinet, “Pride goeth before a fall.” Richard of
that ilk goes before and alter and all roundaseries
of moral collapses. From his own confession in the
prologue we gather that he was a good boy until
he secured a good voice, but as his vocal powers
increased his virtue suffered, and he went from
ginger beer and rectitude to champagne and
robbery, upon which embezzlement and for-
gery supervened. (There is a moral in all
this which we must stop right here to
gouge out, —Yeung man ; Never have a good
voice, it will drag you to Darlioghurst—be like
amateur singers at suburban concern). Bscrping
to Francs' - , Pride collapses a min, he carouses at a
cal 6 in a Parisian surer t (being probably impelled
to this excess by noticing tbat the stupid shop-
keepers announce their calling in the Engiisa
language), and being captured, is sent out to
Australia for a3O years’stretch. His worst ex-
cesses are committed in the Murrumbidgee dis-
trict, where he constructs a coo-ee out of the com-
bined tones of the raopoke and native bear, grips
his loaded lifle by the muzzle, states how his mare
Kate “showed tne troopers her forelegs,” when
they chased him, and soliloquises in a part of the
bush which is distinctly sprinkled with the
Parisian snow of a former act. His costume in
this scene is absolutely faultless. He wears heavy
top-boots, dark trousers, and a Salvation Army
shirt. These garments, with a scarlet silk hand-
kerchief, we have always regarded as peculiar to
bushrangers—and members of suburban fire
brigades. In the succeeding scenes. Mr. Douglas
manages to sink his own identity and climb up to
quite a high ridge above the level of mediocrity.
* * *
Mr. Burford did strong and consistent
work as Bernard, and his make-up was excellent.
Rodney handled a three-cornered part with more
than accustomed skill, and submitted to the in-
sertion of a bowie-knife into his digestive organs
with pious resignation and becoming fortitude.
Johnny Hall (somehow wo always leave him to
the last, this is because we know that there is no
fear of forgetting him) amused the bouse mightily,
and as there is but little assistance afforded him by
the piece, his success is distinctly creditable to
him. During the court seene he makes a des-
perate effort t" go off tne stage, but is dragged
back by toe officer. This undue officiousness on
the part of tbe peeler earned for nitn our un-
changeable hatred. Man’s inhumanity to man
makes hundreds of theatre-goers mourn.

“Janet Pride” must have been written
very 10.-’g < go. Several dramas, teste “ Wages of
Sin,” “ Woman of the People.” “The New Mag-

The Sydney Royal has been crowded from
Saturday night. Mlts Kate Bishop, as Pauline,
appropriates the pudding of the current piece,
“Called Back.” She tails in love in the most natural
manner, and through a tolerably long lifetime of
trouble retains her youtn and beauty unimpaired.
She goes prettily mad, too, after the murder
of her brother. Not the ripping, tearing kind of
lunatic to which we are used, does she become,
but a gentle, mil d-manm red imbecile. She obeys
her husband without answering him, and never
fights for the last word. Miss Bishop's acting
throughout was charming, and in the last scene
her ability was unquestionably apparent. If she
were really a Bishop hers would be the church
militant here on earth. She goes through sorrow
and suffering in a wholesale way with occasional
job lots thrown in, but comes up sending at the
ilnish, eager and anxious for another round with
the grim knocker-out Adversity.

Dr. Oenari was represented by Mr. J. A.
Meade. Anyone could tell in the first part he was
a doctor-he looked like oue-a horse-doclo-.
In the last act he has a bad time. After being left
for dead in the snow, he is borne in by a couple of
soldiers and flogged. This does him good, and he
gets well enougn to attest Paulines innocence,
but dies just as he is about to disclose the name of
Anthony’s murderer. I'hs, and halt h's secret,
goee wit- a t-jas, uvww w
Rignold really murdered Anthony, because if he
had we meet as strangers in the future, George
and ourselves. Cenaridies splendidly—it ia the best
thing he does—and the last.
* * *
George Rignold, as Maoari, the spy, was
unlike any spy we have ever seen, His forehead
was no higher than an infant’s instep, and his
make-up more Hike that of a bank-olerk than a
betrayer of trust, though ia that point he re-
sembled one perhaps more strongly than else-
where. He is one of those villains (Macari,
not Rignold) for whom the average man would
wait with a shot gun and put away in the calm and
silent waterhole when he had introduced two
fingers of buckshot into his abdomen at four or
five paces. He betrays his fellow-conspirators,
lies about Pauline, and areneral'y acts as if villainy
claimed him for her own. All through the presen-
tation Rignold differs from King Henry, and we
are glad to note that the play is not so “ ’andsome
Georeish” as most of hia perlormances are. He
was inc ined to allow tne audience to see that
th-re are some other characters in the piece, and
tne public are consequently thankful. His acting
throughout was faultless

Pauline, improv s uaon acquaintance. He is, as

Until we saw “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” at
the Gaiety we never knew why Lincoln was
assassinated. No high-spirited people could let a
mau live who liberated such a mob. Upon the
actors themselves, too, the play must have a de-
moralising tendency. We noticed this particu-
larly in the cases ot a young nigger in moleskin
pasts and odd braces, and of a coloured lad with
an aggressive-looking natch extending from the
lumbir vertebite to tne termination of the spinal
column. Tne former, during the first few
nights of the play, kept a good deal in the
back-ground, busying himself picking cotton,
wtn an occasional “ break-down ” to work
off his superfluity of animal spirits. But
of late he has begun to doveiope a dangerous
« mbit ion to work ms way to the front, jump into
th-j air and yell In a manner that makes us thank-
ful that negro slavery was never Introduced into
Australia. It is sad to mark the gradual adoption
ot boisterous eccentricities of tnis young person
and speculate on wnat it mu-t inevitably lead to.
In the interests of the lad himself we would sug-
gest that when next he treats the audience to a
howl ot more than savage ferocity M. Legree
should come on with a seasoned cow-hiae and
establish something like order. Par better tnis
than provoke the audio ace to take the matter in
hand.
But the case of the boy is sadder still.
He is a lad of 10 or 11. We had hopes of him at
first. But wnen we saw him the other night turn
nis elbows out and affect a blasi swagger in a plan-
tation walk-round, the gloomiest foreoodlngs
possessed us B-ought up like that, there's no
knowing where the poor child’s instincts will lead
him. He may become a corner-man, or take up
the concertina. He might even davelope into a
policeman, or—tb© thought is gloomy—into a
newspaper reporter, if his aspirations are thus
suffered to run wild. Toe authorities who are
supposed to see that a cheek is put on such crimi-
nal tendencies should look to it. We were glad to
observe that a little bit of “spread-eagleism” in-
troduced into the piece met with a cold reception.
It was where the runaway slave, George Harris
(Mr, Dampler). alluded to Canada as the “country
governed oy Victoria, Biglanl’a Queen, where no
slave is to b o tound.” Any desire to applaud this
noble sentiment was promptly squelched by a
Crtluc-looking mariner in the gallery sardonically
squirting a cascade of tobacco-juice into the pit,
and cynically remarking, “ Well, I’m ”

The slave-martyr, Uncle Tom (Mr. Lewis),
sang, and his perlorma'ice explained at once why
his master sold him on condition that be
should be removed as far down the Mississippi as
possible. Tom’s belief la the literal truth of
Scripture should be a lesson to other Toms who
try to foist taelr shallow scepticism on a discern-
ing public. He was unversed in modern exegesis,
and was fortunately dead long before Bradumgh
bad left off teething. Miracles were Toms
stro-g point—that of Daniel and the lions being
bis favourite one It never occurred to him tbat
the lions were merely keeping Daniel for the next
day, being already surfeited with Jew pawn-
brokers, given to mem es pledges by the King.
But it was when on board the steamer, this long-
suffering coloured man had a good chance, by tell-
ing a thumping lie, of saving the Hying Bdzi, and
yet preferred to tell the truth, tuat you recog-
nised tow nigger nature lias changed since his
day. At last you go full of himself and his psalm-
slogiug, and regretted that it wasn’t he, and not
Daniel, who had to interview the beasts. The
chief characteristics of Miss Llvmgtoa’s Topsy is
its originality. The same may be said of Mr
Sneridan’s Liwyer Marks. Misi Kemble’s resolve
to save her child, at all hazards. showed the
strength of the maternal instinct, a ud was received
with favour by ail tbe actual ana prospective
mothers in the pit. The piece continues to draw
good houses.

The opening item on Saturday was the
overture. Porter, who isgradually getting stouter,
gave a floe reiidarmg of the martia air, “ IM C >n-

Porter would make a good soldier, aud subse-
quently tried to coax him into j lining the Sydney
L-mceahs, but he explained that ho had ail the
flgnt knocked out of nlm long ago in a deadly
encounter with a crawfish, and now he is onlv mar-
tial on the st ge; off it, he is quieter baa a frozen

Amery’s sonorous voice filled the hall
with the music of “ A Hundred Fathoms Deep.”
His lungs must be about that depth; he gets
down so low that the man who wrestles with the
big fiddle, catch-as-catch-can, has to go down on
his knees to find the note. We’ve often been
down on our knees to find a six-'ence. The quar-
tette chorus in this item was the most musical
feature in the bill.

The “ Maid and the Magpie ” was Bent’s
contribution to the first part of the programme.
There is a sort of plot in this melody. A sailor
and a farmer are mixed up with the maiden and
the magpie to such an extent that a coalition be-
tween the parties appears imminent, but the
magpie by betraying her mistress’ love for the
sailor leads the farmer to shoot him. the maiden
immediately stabs herself with a crochet-need’e,
the farmer jumps into the well and spoils the
water by dying in the hole, the cat eats the mag-
pie, and the jig is up. This may not be the correct
version of the niece, but, like “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” it is an adaptation.

“ Dark Days ” is running its third week at
the Melbourne Bijou. This drama ia the joint
work of Hugh Conway and Comyns Carr. Since
the death of the former, Mr. Carr has announced
to the world that the popular novelette, “Dark
Days,” was merely the child of the drama, and
quite an after-thought of its Juoky author. Whe-
tuer the world would have been favoured with
this statement if poor Fargus hadn’t fallen a
victim to Italian drainage Is open to doubt. He
can't contradict his ooliaborateur’s assertion be-
cau°e he ia dead, but to our way of thinking the
drama presents evidence of being adapted from a
book already written. Such names as Raggie
Morton, Drummond, Edward Sleight, and Charlie
Punter appear on the playbill. The dialogue of
the drama furnishes no clue to the Identity of
these people. Evidently, then, the public were
presumed to be already acquainted with Raggie
and Co. when the drama was concocted. Again,
the first scene is “Mr. North’s house in London.”
There is only a Dr. North and Mrs. N.in the drama.
Finally, the lengthy dialogues in which the first
three acts abound are strongly suggestive of adap-
tation. A glance through the novel would enable
us to form a more decided opinion upon the merits
of Mr. Oomyns Carr’s claim. But we never read
novels. Our studies are confixed to the two B’s—
Bible and Bulletin.
* * *
The plot of Hugh Conway’s book is pro-
bably familiar to the majority of our readers, so
it is not necessary to give more than an outline of
the drama. This is divided into five acts. The
first act gives us a love-making scene between
Percy Pendand and Ethel Bi-abourne, and ditto
between Dr. North and Phlllippia Lafarge, in
which the lady announces her secret marriage
with Sir Mervyn Ferrand as the curtain falls. The
second act contains the Interview between Sir
Mervyn and the tout William Evans with the sub-
stquent scene in which the naughty baronet
springs the news of his former marriage upon
Pnillippia and her medical admirer. The third,
and most dramatic act, is devoted to the baronet’s
visit to Dr. North’s house, and his murder by
Evans. A feeble fourth act transpires in beville,
and a still feebler fifth introduces us to the in-
terior of the Assize Court, at Tewnbam, wherein
William Evans, after standing a good even money
chance of being acquitted, wantonly “gives him-
self away ” In an altogether impossible fit of funk
Tnis Courthouse scene flavours strongly of the
ridiculous. Tne general public only mustered to
the extent of six or seven the night we looked in.
The curtained doorway led immediately into a
bleak country road, from which we inferred
that the witnesses waited their turns on the
nearest milestone. As lor the jury, no wily
prisoner, like Evans, would have let one of
them pass unchallenged. Twelve more blood-
thirsty-looking fellows never voted away another’s
life.
* * *
Mr. Titberadga was uniformly good as Sir
Mervyn Ferrano, so good that we were nn-
fe gnedly sorry to lose him in the third act. Mr.
Fiemming was equally successful as Dr. North
Sir Mervyu’s sneering reference to the doctor’s
“ frank and open face ” was understandable.
There is something open about Mr. Flemming's
countenance. Tae way in which ho brushed back
hla hair would inspire confidence In the breast of
a ladies’ school nuscrets If Mr. F. is only half as
honest as he looks he will go to “ Nweet Beulah-
land’’—wherever that may be. The William Evans

succeeded in preventing his terrified lligut

Irving’s representation of “ Faust,” at
London Lyceum, is a very giddy affair indeed, in
the whole course of her highly succesiful theatri-
cal career Miss Ellen Terry has probably never
perpetrated so grave an error as she i-t guilty 0 f
when, as Marguerite in “ Faust,” she takes off her
dress in sight of the wondering audience, and goes
gaily In search of her nightgown robed only in
virtue and her petticoat, etcetera. Miss Terry, in
loose flowing garments, has been properly re-
garded as the High Priestess of the aesthetes for a
considerable period, and so long as she clung to
ample and indefinite robes her position was secure-
the instant, however, that she stepped out of her
dress and stood before people, a large framed,
rather angular woman, with unpleasantly red
arms, it was all over. One remembered that she
was a widow and a mother—one recalled anything
and everything, rather than that she was supposed
to personify Goethe's modest little maiden of
barely 16 summers. To see so much-photographed
a Jady eventually retire from the stage in one
petticoat without having taken off her stockings,
was dreadful to the gallery and the bald-heads of
the stalls. No wonder Alfred Bennett disgustedly
left a land where such things could be.

This accounts for the cow-juice in the

to discover why so many of our Khakee heroes of
the Nanny-goat Campaign troubled to turn up
and receive their useless bits of nickel. It has
now leaked out, however, that a rumour was in-
dustriously circulated among the warriors bold to
the effect that the Governor s speech would run as
follows:—” Citizens ! Soffliers I and Heroes Un-

recognition, and it is, therefore, my pleasing duty
now to present you with what I am sure your true
hearts will value more than any medal or decora-
tion I can besmw, and that is a ticket for a square
meal at the “Piying scud,” and a good old quart
of “tangle.” No wonder the men gaped at their
pewter dumps with ili-concealed contempt and
wa'ked off with looks on their bronzed brows that
would take the sour even out of a green lemon.
HOLD ON TO PROOF.
Proof is a difficult principle to get at. Lawyers,
©t course, know how to manufacture it, but then
they are specialties in the art of proving black to
be white, and vice versa; and c.*n so throw dustlnto
witnesses’ eyes that taose unhappy people are
speedily afflicted with color blindness. Again, that
which is proof to one man is not to another. Men
and women, then, are susceptible to proof very
much ia proportion to tne influence of their pre-
judices. However, there are some matters which
are superior to all question or doubt. Take for
example Mr, Joseph Hankin’s testimony to the
tllLacy of Warner s Safe. Cure, Here is evidence
whmh cannot be weakened; proof which cannot
be gainsaid. Mr. Rankin who is a well known
resident on Farreli-street, P rt Melbourne, states
that he has been sick with liver andkiduey troubles
lor the past seven months, and that during that
time he had treatment from not lets than nine
doctors. He got so bad at Jast that he was recom-
mended to go to the hospital. •* I was as much as
told,” writes Mr. Rankm, “ that my case was incur-
able.” * * * During my slckm ss, I toots all kinds of
remedies, but never found relief until I tried
Warner s Safe Cure and Safe Pills. At that time I
could scarcely walk across a room. Before I had
finished two bottles I felt a new man, and now,
persisting in the treatment, have so far recovered
that I contemplate getting back to work very
shortly. In my case I can honestly declare that!
have been brought back from the grave by War-
ner's Safe Cure.” This is the kind of proof that
knocks over doubt and annihilates scepticism.
When a man has been almost literally snatched out
of the very jaws of death Itself, it would be very
difficult to prave to him that the agent of h)S
rescue was other than infallible. Mr. Rankin, then,
holds on to proof, which, in his case, is certalmy
irrefutab e And, indeed, the proof which is illut-
trated in the c fact teat, but for its ex-
istence, the subject of its operation would, in all
probability, have none, is perba s ts sound aid
sohoi-BQtial evidence as ever confounded sophist or
casuist.

tory. it will be against several sound prin-
ciples of mental science if its usefulness
here is ever proved. Such offences are the out-
come of weak brains and of diseased imaginations
The idea of meeting physical violence by physical
violence is specious, but unsound. To apply phy-
sical violence for the repression of offences which
originate, nine times out of ten, in cerebral weak-
ness, is not reasonable. This misuse of instruments
is characteristic of British communities. As a
notion, the British are behind in psychological
science. They cannot see line hut well-marked
shades of difference As in their diet, they want
something solid, like roast beef, so in their treat-
ment of criminals of all sorts they want some-
thing * they oau fee) with their ©yes shut
—a halter or a cat o’ nine tails. The Latin mind is
different. It is to Latin influences the humanisa-
tion of the British criminal code is due. Every
offence used to be met physically. For one thing,
the nose went. For another, the ears. For
another, the eyes were plucked out, or the unper
lip torn off, or the scalp cut away. When Con-
stantine ascended the throne, he ordered these
penalties to be put down as the cruelties of British
barbarians. He was not a model himself, but with
the eye of his race he saw disproportion, un-
suitableness, inconsequence in the British system
of punishment. That system has been tem-
pered from time to time, but still starts
from the old base. Imprisonment, restraint,
compulsory industrial occupation in conflne-
ment, do not satisfy the genius )of the Austral’an
offshoot ©f the British family. To feel that it is
punishing vice it must see drops drawn and skin
flying. It begins with that. That in turn breeds
purblindness as to when, if ever, these drastic re-
medies may be applied. Hence we have such
cases as the one we take for a text 't hose, we
repeat who would flog the brutal and calculateg
garotter, have a plausible though rotten argu-
ment on their side. Those wbo would flog a set
of depraved drivelling half-imbecile wretches
who bear on their countenances evidences of their
broken brains ought to introduce the oat to the
lunatic asylums to keep refractory patients in
order. Is It of anyuss directing the attention of
the apologists for flogglpg to the fact that the
House of Commons, a few months since, emphati-
cally refused—and at a time, too, when the nation
was writhing in the agonies of the Stead case—to
sanction dogging for offences against decency ?

“In France, the oxen that work in the

Says a rural exchange:— 44 A disgraceful

ends there. Everyone is aware that it shall profit
a man nothing if he gain the whole world and lose
his own soul. But, then, nobody else makes anv
thing by the transaction. The recipient of true

The controversy re Sydney cabmen in the
D T. is assuming a humorous phase. One writer
states his experience of a cabman, who seemed
everything that was civil, obliging, and genteel-
the man, evidently who would help you out when
you stopped at a pub., and help yon in when you
were ready to start for the next corner. The
alleged existence of the courteous cabman is, how-
ever, received with derision by a victim who sar-
castically remarks:—“No doubt 4 J.H.Y.’ has
found one of the lusi naturce himself (ought he
not in simple Christian charity to give his num-
ber.”). No, nol You can write in jencomiantlo

The Launceston correspondent of the

telegram:— 44 The body of John Armstrong, a
labourer, about 45 years of age, was found floating
by the Queen’s Wharf yesterday G3th inst.) after-
noon. It had been in the water 10 days. Deceased
was unmarried and had no children.” What are
we to understand from the concluding paragraph
of this 41 wire?” Are we to conclude that the
fact of an unmarried man dying in Launceston,
and leaving no children is such an unusual event
that when it does occur it is deserving of special
notice? We leave 44 our own correspondent” to
answer the question. John Armstrong must have
felt lonely under the circumstances described, and
probably suicided in consequence.
The Sydney Evening Nuisance informs
the public as an item of public news, that a police-
man, belonging to pious Parramatta, has obtained
14 days’ leave of absence, which 44 he is spending

is a kind of new departure. 44 Mr. Terence O’Toole,
who drives No. 67 nocturnal vehicle, belonging to
Messrs. Slingslush and Co., has obtained a week’s
leave of absence, which he is spending with his
old friends in Woolloomooloo; “ 44 Mr. William

An advertisement in tlie Central Aus-
tralian (Bourke, N.S W.) lets us know that “a
regiment of Wolfe’s Schnapps” would unquestion-
ably give Sara Bernhardt embonpoint. Well, we
once did see a regiment of Wolfe's Schnapps—in
Brisbane, and it was being drilled by a champagne
bottle, in an hotel bedroom occupied by a new
chum, the nephew of a wealthy English Duke.
The new chum, not long before, had come in for a
lot of money, and the usual result followed. When
he set out f« r the station on the Barcoo, he took
with him a 400-gallon tank of rum, and made the
whole country side drunk while the liquor lasted.
When we saw him in thr hotel bedroom he had
“got’em again,” and was under the impression
that t*»e schnapps bottles were men belonging to
his regiment, and that the champagne dead marine
was a subordinate officer of his. Anyhow, he was,
in his capacity as colonel, giving instructions to
the champagne-bottle officer, to whom his com-
mands were communicated by the boots of the
establishment—who had been placed on guard by
the landlord at the urgent request of the best local
medical authority on 41 the D.T.’s.”

"TOWN AND COUNTRY" POESY.
Tf ia written from Puddledock by William
onrt nublished in Sydney Town and Country
Gay, £ t r Itlß a poem entitled “Australia,” and
J° C ow-rrom its intrinsic merit—is interesting as
"^oHnc- the channel which Australian poesy la
iad .oofng out for itself. It is probable that the
characteristics of a country have a good
physical mouldlng . the 6 hape which its im-
literature takes. Thus, by a careful
** nf a nation s poetry, it is ai easy to tell the
stu^raDhtcal features of the country that gave
f?E?5h fts it is to tell the size and idiosyncrasies of
ltbl onVadiluviaa mammal whose front tooth—
-5 under a growing glacier during the early
Tertiary period-has just come to light. And now
for the poem:—
Australia.
« When our first navigators arrived on the coast,
And into this land made entry,
Uew could have believed that a nation almost
Would grow up here in less than a century.
«The beginnings were so-so, the materials un-
sound,
And a great many drawbacks occur d;
not in time, perseverance and energy found
That their efforts would bring their reward.”
The real strength of i his school of poetry lies in the
fact that it not alone satisfies the requirements of
rhvthm but conveys some sound information as
well In this it has a marked superiority over the
half incoherent babble of Shelley and Swinburne.
Indeed the high-sounding but obscure phrase-
ology of the latter quickly pal s upon the ear.
You get tired of sugary phrases, meaning nothing,
and long for some plain facts such as Mr. Gay
the new-not the old original Gay—keeps in
stock:—
•‘With kind and fair dealing, and justice and
truth,
We can rule all the peoples around;
While our free Institutions and schools for our
youth
Prove our national life to be sound.
“But, alas I there are cliques who are doing their
best
Our sweet freedom and rights to uproot;
But with strong self-respect we will drive back
each pest
To their own den of dark disrepute.
Religious, social, and political cliqueism la clearly
repugnant to the author’s frank nature. It may
appear arbitrary and cruel to confine it to Its
“own den of dark disrepute,” but measures that
at first seem harsh are often the most merciful in
thejend. To the timid and chicken-hearted, Mr.
Gay’s method may seem unnecessarily severe, but
it is quite time that those professional plotters
who are constantly scheming “ our rights to up-
root,” should be sept in their places. The two
following verses we take to bo well-recognised
truths, expressed with pardonable scorn:—
“The blackest of deeds are committed oftimes
By the so-called respectahly-connccted,
Who, by bribes and foul Influence, hush up their
crimes,
And too many escape undetected.
“There are numbers in life who look down with a
sneer
On the hard-handed toilers beside them,
Who, if they had their due, would descend to a
sphere
Where they'd find even freedom denied them.”
It is now freely admitted that the curse of N.S.W.
is the number of “ so-called respectably-con-
nected ” idlers who stick at nothing in endeavour-
ing to corceii their crimes by throwing the lynx-
eyed officers of justice off the track. Until such
gentry are as “ well-connected ” as their fathers
were —an iron-bar between four—the colony
will be no placs for an industrious workingman,
la this thoughtful poem there are nine more
verses. We would gladly give all, if only to show
that the reproach of not having mastered the
capabilities of metre as a vehicle for firmly-held
opinions can no longer be laid at Australian doors
—but space forbids. It is a hopeful sigu of the
times, however, when a high-class paper like the
Town and Couniry Journal encourages and
pays for (?) talent such as Mr. Gay, of Puddledock,
possesses. We look forward with pleasant antici-
pation for his next effort, and, if the rising bard
will pardon a friendly hint, would suggest that
other periodica s gladlv publish polished verse
like his. A truly remarkable posm, by Mr. Hay-
ter, the well-known Melbourne Statist, appeared
some months ago in the Victorian Review, a
magazine which, under the able guidance of Mr.
Mortimer Pranalyn, has done much to enable
miners’ huts to defy sudden changes of tempera-
ture. Possessing a highly-trained ear, Mr. Franklyn
is a little fastidious, as [may be guessed by his
having once nearly rejected one of Mr. Douglas
Bladen's poems. But Mr. Gay must not be dis-
heartened. From what we know of Mr. Franklyn,
we are justified in believing that, if tried with a
poem approaching in merit the one under review,
a place would be lound for it in the magazine. We
trust Mr. Gay will try.
(N.B.—Bearing in mind the opening remarks of
this critique, It is suggested that Mr. Gay lives
down a well.—El. B.)
An American paper stakes its reputation
for veracity on this Hobertsonianly romant’o
statement:— ‘ A California wind-storm recently
blew all tne water out of a river, leaving the
river-bed so dry that it has sine® warped into a
mountain.” That s not much of a lie, after all.
In Now Guinea the natives carted away a v/hole
range of mountains because it happened to he
named after a person they disliked, and it Is feared
that they will also fall to acoount for several of
the rivers which Captain Bverill discovered on his
last'ex pedition. This is a serious matter. The cap-
tain should have brought the rivers back with
him.
This is what it has come to. The Mel-
bourne scavengers are now on strike. They want
less hours and more pay. The contractors are
much surprised and even hurt at th's, They state,
in touching terms that they have treated the men
almost as if they were their own relations. They
have taken them to their bosoms and caressed and
Pampered them, and now they turn and bite the
hands that fed them. It is very sad. But there is
a limit to human endurance, and the scavengeis
have gone heyond that of the good kind contrac-
tors that were like fathers to them. Justly in-
cessed at their ingratitude the contractors have
refused to listen to their demands, and have ad-
vertised for men in the daily papers. They ex-
press confident belief in being able to get shoals
of men who win be glad to do the work. Perhaps
they are right. Bourke-street is stiff with pros,
out of employment, just now. A stanza:—
Hoi wiiters for the paper.
Who are out of luck and lucre.
Hoi broken clerk, and draper,
Who have lost your all at euchre,
A fortune waits you fair I
So come along and caper
With the shovel and tne scraper,
And be a soavcngairel
This is a specimen stanza If the contractors think
that a song on this pattern, set to soirited music-
say a lively waltz tuae—would fire the bosoms of
the unemployed to chase the lingering hours away
in cleaning the gutters, we can Jet them have two
more stanzas wit h a rollicking chorus, on condition
that they a low us to nominate, say three, blighted
geniuses of our acquaintance as foremen of the
new gang. It they should think well of this pro-
posal we would suggest that It would be well, In
order to keep the men from losing interest in their
employment and preserve its pristine glamour, to
have a musical box fixed in front of each cart to
Play inspiriting airs, to which the men might sing
merrily as they shovelled up the slush. The
■scavenger’s cart, the centre of as much interest as
the German Band, and the sound of the mud-
turtle would be heard in the land. There is a
Aalizolc beauty about this idea which quite en»
ohants us as we think of it.

The Bey. George Brown’s Experience [?]s
a Ladies’ Mail.
“It was frequently the case, that natives
living within a few miles of each other, did not
understand one word of <be language of thtir
neighbours. They were completely naked, and
the ladies’ wardrobe consisted of a fig-leaf on a
tree half-a-mile away. The lecturer related a
number of Interesting anecdotes regarding the
early days of the mission. One of the mo:t
amusing was somewhat to the following tffect:
His great desire was to get the ladies of the con-
gregation to dress, and on one occasion he went
to the chief's wife and endeavoured to persuade
her to set a good example. She promised to array
herself, and the missionary gave her a dress.
Imagine his horror when she came to the meeting
with the garment simply tied round the neck I The
next time he made an attempt In that direction be
sacrificed himself and acted as lady's maid.”— The
•Bee. Oeorge Brown's lecture on “ Savage Life in the
South Sea Islands ,” Auckland Evening Star.
It was a missionary man,
A goodly pious Wesleyan,
Who thought that he a brand new plan
Somehow had hit on.
To save the frizzy-headed nigs,
With hair like Monsieur Wigzell’s wigs,
Who live on Infants and fat pigs,
At wild New Britain.
d
“WHICH SHOCKED THIS PIOUS PARSON SO!”
Whose natives wear no scanty clout,
Their sleek black buttocks round about,
And even fig-leaves go without-
Naked as when horn’d;
Except such fig-leaves as you may
See growing half-a-mile away,
So light and simple their array—
Baauty unadorn’d.
Which shocke 1 th's pious parson so,
That he determined he would go
With s'lks, sateen, and calico
Cut for all figures;
With petticoats, and gowns, and sha vis -
Fullbacks and dolmans, veils and falls,
And hold a set of fancy halls
Among those niggers.
And so each ahsp he patronises;
And, at tremendous sacrifices,
Buys goods at less than wholesale prior s;
His destination—
With many bales of merchandise,
And Godly tracts and hymns likewise
fdf
“HE FIXED HIS EYES UPON HIS BOOK.”
Before the favoi’ ng gal© he Hies—
The mission station.
And when be landed on the shore
And told them of the gifts in store,
Although they understood no more
Than babes and sucklings,
They sent up such a joyous shout
They yelled and rolled, and danced about.
And lolled their tongues quite inside out,
With gutt’ral chuckllngs.
They cried out, "Golly, Massa Brown,
You give um plenty white gin’s gown,
Um plenty sing and kneel um down,
And read um Bibles.
No more um white man sailor prig
Um eat um yams and sucking pig,
And cut um swell in Christian rig,
And burn um idols.”
And then a nude, black maid drew near,
With outstretched hand and amorous leer,
Which made poor Brown feel awful queer,
And hide his blushes:
Before her dark, dilating eye=i.
He hr-Id the strange and tempting pr!zi
And clutching it with joyous cries,
Away she rushes.
And all the plump, black Papuan balks,
Stout matrons, piccaninnies, swells,
Surrounded him with heathen yells,
And strange grimaces.
One chieftain “ boned ” a quilted skirt,
Each lubra grabbed a cotton shirt,
And one—a most notorious flirt—
A pair of braces I
And when the Sabbath D ly returned,
The soul of Brown impatient yearned,
To see how his dear pets had learned
The art of drowsing.
And when the hour arrived for prayers,
He mounted up the pulpit stairs,
To watch their fashionable airs.
And give his blessing.
When—horror I through the open doors,
The King of all the blackamoors,
With wives and concubines in scores,
And maids of honour;
Likewise the Queen, came troonlng in
With mincing gait and shark-like grin,
And frizzled hair and well-oiled skin,
And nothing on her I
A gorgeous dress she wore en train,
Of which she seemed exceeding vain,
And gazed around with proud disdain,
And air aesthetic;
And strutted gaily up the aisle,
Exclaiming: “ Golly, I’se de style.”
Bhp gave the minister a smile,
Sweet and pathetic.
The King around his nack he wore
The order of the Pinafore;
And every Royal counsellor
Was decorated
With garter round his forehead placed;
Each maid of honour with great taste.
Who wore the breeches round her waiit,
Looked quite elated.
But as for Browul go shocked was he,
This sad ungodly sight to see,
He skipped the Psalms and Litanee,
To cut it shorter;
He fixed his eyes upon his book.
No wand’ring glance around ha took
Lest upon beauties he might look
He didn’t oughter.
Half of the sermon he forgot,
The offertory went to pot,
He lost of cowrie shells a lot
To fill his purse all;
The benediction he pronounced,
And quickly from the pulpit bounced,
An outside meeting he announced,
A dress rehearsal.
With solemn face he took his stand,
A brand-new chemise in his hand,
And in a voice of stern command
And indignation,
With modestly-averted eyes,
The garment on the Queen be ties
Amidst a murmur of surprise
And admiration.
The King, with royal grace and mien,
Gazed on the interesting scene—
The robing of his favourite Queen,
And downright chuckled,
And said—“ Dis nigger’s welly glad,
You takes um now for wusor bad,
By golly I Massa Brown, you’s hid,
Ole boss, you’re buckled.”
Dat am de custom ob de blacks—
Dem niggers knows I spokes de facks,
Um wants no R’yal Marriage Acks,
Or sich white trashep.
You takes de ole gal in dat rig,
Dat am de will ob dis ’ere nig,
Or else we stews um like um pig—
And hash to hashes.
The Queensland Government, when sup-
pressing Its slave trade, established a Court of Com-
pensation to make good any losses occasioned by
the return of islanders to their homes. Of course,
a i eip of claims have been sent in, and it seems
likely that the cost of the “ return of the kid-
napped ” expedition will be pretty nearly as high
as that of the idiotic N.S.W. goat-napping ditto.
It seems that the price of ebony skin is a rather
variable one, for while the Colonial Sugar Com-
pany claim £6Boj for 93 returned islanders, or
£73 18s. 3d. each, the Queensland Sugar Company
want £Bl for one nigger only. The easiest way
would have been to fix a price per pound for black
fl sh and blood, and " compensate ” according to
we ght. In this way any amount of trouble
might have been saved.
This interesting little correction is from
the Meib. Herald:— “ln the announcement un-
der the head of the Soc'al Circle, of the marriage
of Miss Obbi- son, it was incorrectly stated that
Mr. George Vaughan, of the Loch Yennacbar,
was the bridegroom. The fortunate man was Mr.
George Waghorn, of the Loch Shell. The
bride was given away by her mother, and
not by Mrs. Mather, as stated.” We fancy the
next meeting of Mr. George Vaughan and the
blushing bride will be rather an awkward one.
Ai for the Herald reporter, we believe he is 10
days out and still going.
Last week, Mr. Henry M'Quade, ex-
M.L.A., of Sydney, was sued by one Scott for
£167 6s. on account for fireworks supplied to de-
fendant, who did not appear personally. It was
alleged that the prices were exorbitant. Plaintiff
said that he took down the order In writing, and
djfendant was aware of the price to be charged
when the order was given. Judgment was given
for the full amount.—
Dr. John Quick, LL.D., who has been
elected two or three times to represent Sandhurst
in the Vlctoriaa Assembly, has shown his adber?
tnce to Liberalism to be stronger than his desire
for ollioe and Its emoluments. He refused to
blindly follow the late Coalition Government in
the Parliament 'hat has just been dissolved in Vic-
toria, and when it was proposed to continue the
Coalition under different leaders he denounced
the proposal as loudly as did Professor Pearson,
The leaders of the new Coalition Government
afterwards offered a portfolio to Dr. Quick.as well
as one to Mr, Pearson. But the former declined
and the latter accepted it. We think the young
barrister was right. No true Liberal should ever
coalesce with Conservatives, and particularly
under a Conservative leader when the Liberals are
in a vast majority throughout the country. Had
Dr. Quick joined the hybrid team that has
Just Deen formed in the Southern colony, he
would have virtually committed political sui-
cide. He is a Democrat of the advanced type
and will yet be able to render useful work to tbe
Radical Party- He has brought out a capital book
In favour of.land nationalisation, waich system he
thoroughly believes in ; he has written letters to
the press in condemnation of the brutal system of
flogging : he is an able exponent of the principles
of protection and payment of members, and has
always given an intelligent vote in favour of pro-
gressive measures. The way in wnioh he has
climbed the ladder augurs well for his future. Ten
years ago he was working hart carting quartz to
Kochs Pioneer Crushing works, near Sandhurst,
and wa3 driving the engine at various claims.
Afterwards he j fined the staff of the A ge, and was
head-reporter on that newspaper at the time he
was induced to stand fortte Assembly. He has
since c rried off high honours at the University,
a d has married the daughier of a rich Benaigo
miner. His re-election to tne next Parliament is
considered to be a certainty, as he resides in the
city he represents, and receives the support of his
fel ow-count'yarn, the Victorian natives.
CRUEL.
It seems, y© gods, but yesterday
Tnere was a mighty night parade,
And there went, surging down the Bay,
The cognomen of H, M'Quade.
Black darkness reigned; then there was light;
When suddenly there was displayed
By magic— twas a wondrous sight I
The name, in fire, of H. M'Quade.
The rockets shed their golden glow
(Off went the hungers-" who’s afraid ?”J
AH tnis to music soft and slow,
To glorify the great M'Quade I
Ah, 'twas a great and glorious day;
Yet from a dream he now does start;
For all that glory In the Bay—
That incense he has got to part.

A gloriously mild afternoon tempted a
great number to attend Lady Carington's fourth
reception at Government Hons*, Sydney, last
Weduesday afternoon-indeed the crowd wis so
that to “ move on ” was a matter of no small
difficulty. As usual, the Governor and Lady
Carlngton received on the verandah, and did
taeir best to mase each individual believe that
they were really and truly glad to see them. If
a look of weariaesj did overspread Cady Oariog-
ton s face during a short pause la the arrivals, it
was quid's!? and heroically dispelled by the
Sweetest of smiles when fresh names were an-
nounced. as for the ladies’ costumes there seems
just now to be an uncomfortable hesitancy be-
tween summer and early autumn attire, a Surt of
compromise between the two seasons as it were;
lor instance, occas orally one would see a sum-
mery dress and a nervy headgear, and vice versa.
At the same time there were many consistent
costumes and scores of very handsome ones.
Lady Carlngton wore a soft white Otdaa si k.
small gauze bonnet, with pink rosebuds, long
suede glove?, and white parasol; Miss Harbord,
black and nvoite striood silk dress, black straw
witch-shaped hat trimmed with cream lacaand pi ok
flowers; Mrs. Purvey a snuff coloured canvas dress
relieved by panels of exquisite electric blue
brocade—a striking and happy combination; Miss
Gerty I isoher, a charming uress of crimson, par-
tially veiled with rich biscuit lace flounces, cream
a°e bonnet, touched with crimson; the Misses
Reid, black satin dresses; Mrs. McPhillamy, a very
handsome black costume, the front of bodice and
skirt elaborately embroidered in jet; Miss Halloran,
whits lawn dress, with small white bonnet manned
with marguerites; Mrs Atkinson, brown canvas
costume and becoming bonnet; Madame Keller-
mann, white lawn, trimmed with embroidery and
blue satin ribbons, smaU white lace tippet and
bonnet en suite; Mrs. Belisario, rich black lace
dress and mantle, small black bonnet, relieved by
rose pink flowers; Miss Millie Thompson, a pretty
cream tambour muslin dress, with becoming Jace
bonnet to match; the Misses Atherton, peculiarly
plain but girlish-looking blue cotton costumes,
made with the new sleeves puffed above the elbow,
then tight to the wrists; Mrs. Paget-Bayly, a rich
black dress, relieved by a beautiful cluster of
purple convolvuli worn on the corsage; Mrs
Lohen, black dress, and large white hat
turned up with black velvet and trimmed
with white plumes ; Miss Lake, peach-
eoloured silk dress, black-headed lace tippet
bonnet ornate with flowers; Miss
Madeline Lake, a similar dress and pure white
tulle bonnet; Mrs. Harrie Wood, pink dresi,
trimmed with white lace; Miss Tessie Throck-
morton, pale blue and white striped crepe cloth,
and light bonnet; Mrs. Guilett, a beautiful cos-
tume of amber satin veiled with black Spanish
laca, small high black bonnet and amber silk
neckerchief; Mrs .Addison, a stylish-looking black
and white costume; Mrs. Foreman, a tasteful
dress in fawn colour showered with brown tufts;
Miss Harper, paie heliotrope silk and white lace;
Mrs. Sydney Want, pure white. A really gorgeins
gown was a sky-blue broche adorned with cord,
tasses, and most unheard-of furbelows; hat of
white net the front brim of which was turned up
In most peculiar manner and fastened to the
high crown. The effect was startling. The re-
freshment tables in the ballroom were well patro-
nised during the afternoon, and the Artillery
Band discoursed music of unusual excellence.
A happy little affair -which had been talked
of for s*me time io Cootamundra eventuated on
Monday morning, the 15th iast., when Mr. H A.
O'Donnell, solicitor, linked nis fortunes with
those of Miss Hettie Eccleston, youngrest daughter
of the late H. I. Esoleston, of Coonghoombula
Station, Monaro. The bride was prettily and
tastefully dressed, and was given away by her
cousin, Mr. N. A. Byrne, J.P., of Cootamundra,
whilst the last offices for the bachelordom of the
groom were entrusted to Mr. J. M. Grosvenor
accountant of the local branch of the City Bank.
The sister of the bridegroom filled the part of
bridesmaid-in-chief. Alter entertaining their
guests at Keira, their future home, the wedded
pair left by train for Wagga Wagga.

The suburbs on the Illawarra railway line
prove attractive to -Sydneyites in more ways than
inland sales. Arnciiffe, bn the afternoon of the
17tb, was the scene of a double event in the
shape of the marriages of the Misses Gavina F. and
Margaret T., daughters of Mr. Alex. M. Fell. J P„
the well-known oil manufacturer, to Mr. William
Napier, of Sydney, and Mr. Ernest 0. Carter, of
Melbourne, respectively. The ceremonies were
performed at Meryton, the residence of the brides’
parents, by the Rev. M. Yale, of Newcastle, and
the Rev. Mr. Paten, of Petersham. the Misses Pell
and Ogden acting as bridesmaids to Miss Fell, and
Miscies Kidd and Addie Fell doing like service for
Miss Maggie. The dresses of the brides were of
c earn sitin with the usual bridal wreaths,
bouquets, &c. At the breakfast, tne toas r s were
rece.vad with all the more enthusiasm on account
of there being few. and amid an unstinted shower
of rice and old leather, the happy quartette took
their departure for tne Mountains. A goodly
number of friends from Sydney and suburbs
arrived by train in time for the ball, which was
given at Meryton in the evening.

the membe-sof the O. B Society, Brewarrina, en-

mercial Bank (prior to nis departure, in conse-

Why these good people should choose this method
of showing their good feeling to Mr. Graham, is a
mystery. Fancy dancing with the thermometer

Mr. J, C. H. James, Commissioner of Land Titles
for Western Australia. late ot the Oxtord Circuit,
with Miss Rebecca C. Clifton, eldest daughter of
Mr. Charles W. Clifton, Registrar-General, created
some little excitement. Tne wedding took place
at 3 o’clock, tne Richt Rev. W. W. Parry, D.D ,
Bishop of IDrtn, officiating. The bride wore a
ortss of creatr satin and lace, long piain train, and
tulle veil, rhe two bridesmaids wore costumes of
blush-pink, with coffee-lace hats turned up with
cardinal velvet, coffee-lice and blush-pink
f ;athers, shoes, hose, and gloves to match. The
bridegroom was attended by the Kon. J icelyne
Amhurst and Mr R. B. Burnside. The honeymoon

An extremely simp’e and quiet wedding
took place at St. Janus’ Cathedral, Victoria, at
8.30 o’clock on the Bhof February, between Miss
ugaes Monaghan, only daughter of Mr. James
Monaghan, of Sydney, N.B W . and Mr. Charles
Browne, of Meloourne. 'J he bride who was given
away by her father, wore an exceedingly pretty
dress ot white embroidered musnn with straw
bonnet trimmed with white and white feather

handsome presents were received, amongst which
were two very valuable gifts, one from Messrs.
Rosenthal, Aronson, and Co., In whose firm the
bridegroom has long been, and one from his fellow
employes. The honeymoon was spent at Lome.
Mrs. Browne’s travelling costume was a beauti-
fully fitting, tailor-made gown of grey with toque
to match.

It was a delicious balmy night when the
first moonlight concert was held at Aahfleld Ke-
ereation Ground, and over 300 people) attended,
me volunteer band played, and a party of gentle-
men sang glees, but tae cone ert per se, was not a
pretentious one, and the ciarm of the evening
was the novelty and freedom of the affair, where
everybody smoked or chatted about the trim
grounds in the quiet moonlight. Not a breath
of wind stirred, and everyone regretted that soma
ladies voices were not enrolled In the list of
singers, as the perfect stillness was favourable to
sound, aod the oand could be plainly heard over a
mile away. In the members’ pavilion billiards
were played, while all round the ground—where
little parties sat on the seats and “talked soft’
lanterns were suspended. Toe stand was also
lively with coloured lantems-to say nothing of
popping corks, and the whole scene verged on the
romantic. Lots ot ladies were present, and if the
marriage rate doesn’t rise in Ashfleid it will be
funny to us.

[?]
Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,— Just as I expected, the
Londoners are dreadfully shocked at the news of
poor Mrs. Saia’s sudden death out here amongst
us. I well remember the last time I saw her. It
was at the house of a mutual friend, where we had
met to partake of high tea and spend tne evening,
I fancy I see her now, as she reclined on an easy
chair and chatted so pleasantly to us all. Of
course you are aware she was handsome, and
knew how to dress, too. How proudly she spoke
of her home in Mecklenburgh Square, London,
and how little she ever dreamed then that she
would never see it again 1 She told us that
sne was quite pleased with us colonials ;
in fact, she thought us nearly as nice as
Americans. The nearly wasn't very palatable to
us, you may be sure, but as sue evidently
meant _ it as very high praise, indeed,
we did our best to take it as such.
Quite content with jthe way me world used her,
proud of her borne, and perfectly satisfied that her
husband had no peer, no wonder tbe amiable lady
so well preserved her good looks. Poor Mr. Salal
I wonder who will pour out his tea for him now,
for you know, dear, he is as fond of that innocent
beverage as Dr. Johnson used to be—six cups at a
meal being quite moderate in his eyes. Ah, well,
I suppose nothing but time will soften his grief,
but at all events he has our very deepest
sympathy.
There has really been nothing doing this week,
with the exception ot a few dinner parties and
the reception. Perhaps you will not be sorry to
hear that there is a retorm now in progress re-
lating to dinners. Instead of the numberless
courses hitnerto deemed Indispensable, leaders of
society permit four plats only. Now, won’t
this be much nicer ? I consider it absolutely sin-
ful to spend nearly two hours at a time eating
and drinking, and it’s not only the waste of time I
object to, but one would need to possess the
digestive po vers of an ostrich to stand—say three
ol these elaborate dinners a week with impunity.
Then, again, have you never experienced what a
dreadful punishment it is to be placed next to a
man wno hasn’t two ideas in his bead, and who, at
me same time, is so oppressively attentive
that life during that dinner is one big tiresome
burthen. As I have been a martyr to this bore-
dom more than once lam able to speak feelingly
on the subject, and must confess that I, for my
part, hall with joy and gladness the dinner of four
courses instead or eight-which means a saving ot
nearly a whole hour.
I have simply nothing to tell you about the last
reception, excepting that the male element was
pn-tty strong, and that ladles’ dress-sleeves were
worn so ii<nt that one lady’s elbow actually burst
through. Ic wasn’t a pretty soft wnlte dimpled
elbow, else it mightn’t have mattered so much. A
red bocy elbow isn’t by any means an attractive-
looking article, aud I should advise ladies possess-
ing such to get their dressmakers to allow them
more elbow room la their sleeves. Talking of re-
ceptions. 1 mm t not forget to tea you that a few
ot our leading sno os here are doing meir best to
persuade Lady Carington to receive only a chosen
few on her reception days, aad we were all won-
dering where the line is to be drawn. I should
fancy this “ sifting-out” business will be rather a
trounleaome job, and if too much “ niceness
is shown in the selection i am afraid
very lime of toe pure stuff will remain,
and it is not at ah unlikely that the;e arrogant
ous who are so fearful ot contamination with
“vulgar peop e who earn their living honestly”
win be th mstlves left out in the cold. Perhaps
Lady C irlcgtoa will s.o -v a preference for ladies
ot gentle and honourable descent (even should
their hanking accounts amount to very little), and
not devote nerself txMusively to the "first
families” of N.d.W. Such fastidiousness on
the part of Lady Carington will surely
tell against these busy bodies, who will,
no doubt, wish they had been content to let mat-
ters rest. By the way, several of these injured
ones gave themselves away entirely by absenting
themselves from the last reception, but it was
comforting to see that their non-appearance failed
to make Lady Carlngton the least bit unhappy.
Professor Bulteau, who gave a lecture last night
at Newtown, doesn’t believe in women being too
learned. He remarks that nearly all women of
literary note look worn, sad, and tired. He
avers that the female brain is unequal to
the strain, and it is simply ambition which
tempts a woman to go for University
honours and the like. In his own experience
young ladies who have worked during the term
with far more patience and Industry than any man,
have been so utterly prostrated at the end of the
P eri od that they have been simply incapable of
anything further and have been compelled to give
up the fight for a time, If not for good, their poor
brains being completely over-taxed. He does not
say that women should be brought up as ignorant
tools—far from it, for what sort of companions
would they make in that case for husbands or
brothers? But he does say that the University
cramming, so far as females are concerned, is a
mistake. Well, now, that s all right. As long as
we are convinced that it Is really out of concern
tor our welfare that the men object to our Intrud-
ing on their ground, I am certain we shall not letl
so bad about it. It is only when they say a girl
must be wanting ia modesty because she pores
over books that are only fit for themselv s. that
we suspect their objection to learned women is
°niy the result of jealousy Jest she proves her-
self their equal in brain-power. But it just
shows how we are apt to misjudge men’s
motives—bless their dear hearts I Fancy our
being so angry with them all this time be-
cause they wanted to exclude us from their Uni-
versities when their chief motive in so doing was
their concern lest we should become old, worn
and ugly—not to say ill-tempered—betore our
time. It makes me think that they do really
care for us a little bit—or, can it be that they prefer
well-ordered households and well-cooked dinners
to wives who are continually writing essays, and
can’t tell a grilled chop from a fried one? For
my part, dear, although I may admire, I nearly
always fear a blue-stocking, they are amongst the
most aggressive things I know, and I generally
contrive to give them a wide berth, but, of course,
that’s probably due to my incapacity to compre-
hend their learned talk. Yes, I think I can say I
agree with Professor Bulteau that too much learn-
ing for the ordinary woman is a mistake, unless, of
course, she possess the powers of a George band,
Madame de Stael, or a George Eliot.
Are you glad to hear that the old fashioned
two-buttoned glove Is being favoured again ? I
should have received the news with joy had I taken
my dear prudent cousin’s advice some time back
and bought up a few dozens of these articles which
have been selling here in all the shops for next to
nothing, ever since the Sara Bernhardt glove same
in. I thought I knew best and fancied the long
glove would live as long as I should, but it just
shows you what a foolish, improvident creature
your humble servant is. However, we shall be
compelled to wear linen cuffs again now, and that
I really like, for it gives such a nice finish to one’s
dress, doesn’t it ?
Ever yours,

Te Sydney Echo, a pious little paper
which is quite an authority on theological mat-
ters, thinks the people of St. John's Church, Tam-
worth, a stiff-necked race because they wouldn t
stand up when Bishop Turner came into church.
Certainly not, why should they ? What’s the use
of people paying rent for “ sittings” in a church
if tney can’t sit down in them ? Besides, If stand-
ing up is a kind of mark of respect to a bishop
they’d have to stand on the seats for an arch-
bishop, while nothing but stilts would do when a
cardinal came along.

Only fancy what N.B.W. will suffer if the
jaynll Dan. loses his “Victoria Cross of public
die.” The Evening News says that the arrange-
ments made for an earlier delivery of letters in
Sydney will most probably fall through if Dan.
‘ retires from the administration of the Postal
Department.” If any arrangements have been
made we suppose the next man in can see them
carried out; and if he doesn’t, won’t Dan be able to
do a war dance on the liure of the House, and ten
us all about them ? Anyway the News has struck
a new line in advertising a man’s claims to be a
Minister of the Crown.
Startling indeed are the tidings which are
flashed along from time to time to Sydney by
those intellectual giants in the country, who eke
out a precarious existence by combining the sister
arts of half-soleing and heeling, and corresponding
for the Evening News. Seriously, 'twas but the
other day we were paralysed to hear through the
telegraphic medium of that valuable “Jernel’
that tne bellman at Tamworth had a lit, and to-
day wo are knocked silly with admiration for the
Mudgee genius who wires—“ Mr. Robert Cohen
died on Monday. Tne deceased was of the Jewish
persuasion.” This, of course, will put the Tinpot
Swamp Reuter on his mettle, and we fully expect
to find our next garfish speculation wrapped in a
Nooze which says ” Patrick O Rourke com-
mitted suicide by swallowing a glass of undiluted
water to-day. Deceased was supposed to be of
Irish extraction, and there is no foundation for
the rumour that he was a scion of the Bourbon
family. The person named Quong Soong bee,
who was found camped near a fence minus bis
head on Tuesday last, proves to have been a
Chinaman, and suspicion rests on one Hans
Schlausenheimerfrundenpouf, wholis believed to
be a German.”
At the Sydney Metropolitan Quarter Ses-
sions Court, on the 17th inst., Mr.T. M. Williamson,
attorney for a prisoner, was examining a witness
as to the nature of an oath, when his Honor
J udge Forbes interjected, “ What nonsense,” and
the following conversation ensued:—“Mr. Wil-
liamson: ‘Surely, your Honor, I can ask the wit-
ness whether she Knows whore she will go to when
she dies it she tells a lie?’ His Honor: ‘Do you
Know?' Mr. Williamson: *Oh 1 well.’ His Honor:
‘ 1 don’t think you do, or any one else.’ Mr. Wil-
liamson: ‘But the law allows us to anticipate.’
His Honor: • You would be satisfied, I suppose, if
the child said, “If 1 tell tne truth I shall go to
heaven, and it I tell a lie I shall go to hell.” ’ Mr.
Williamson: * Yes.’ His Honor: ‘lt is all clap-trap
—absurd.’ The attorney abandoned the question.’
Judicial friend, Forbes,
Your late judgment absorbs ’
Us in deep and profound meditation;
May we now enquire
What’s the lot of tbe liar
And his last and right-through destination?
We anticipate
By the law, that his fate
Will be hot in the sultry for ever ;
His case, then, the worst
And his main trouble thirst,
When he crosses the brimstone-banked river.
But you, legal light,
On this point set us right
And, of course, you, learned brother, should
know—tnero
We’ll argue no more,
From the evergreen shore
You can wire us his fate when you go there.

THE HOT SYDNEY SUMMER.
We loved a girl in winter time,
Her name was Angelina Glayde;
We cannot love her now, for she’s
T >o economically made.
This is some of what tha Sydney Free
thinkers demand:—“We demand full religious,
Political, and social liberty for woman, that she
Jnav become tbe emaneipated companion of man.
We shall never support this; at least, not till the
price of arnica goes down.
She wasn’t young, although she had the
skittishness of youth, and she was trying 1 1 math
a vouthful squatter, whose puny figure compared
uisudvantageously with her magnificent physique,
as displayed to full advantage six nights a wuek
before tne footlights. “You know,” She archly
said “everybody pets and coddles me. You can t
imagine how much my parents made of me, ’ “I
don’t know about that,” he replied, meditatively;
"I should say about fourteen ft one seven was the
figure ” And if she can do him an ill turn one of
these days it’s a million to a pinch of snuff on the
grey mare.
An English fashion paper says:—“The
bustle is coming to the front more rapidly than
ever” This is so. In any of the quieter streets
about Sydney you will constantly see two or three
girls stop and look all around to see that no one
much is about, then they Jean naraiols up against
the wall and take turns In fixing one another s
bustle—pulling it straight and tying it fres*, and
maybe tucking in a long tape that has been trailing
all down tne street. Then, when everything has
been reefed in nicely and the whole concern put
dean aft, you will see the girls give a little self-
approving shake and start oft to do the block
again. Oh, yes, bustles are coming to the front in
spite of all the appliances that have been Invented
to anchor them In the proper locality.
Lady Randolph Churchill is young and
pretty, and the Baroness Burdett Coutts is old
and ugly. Lady Randolph »-as recently canvass-
ing for the Baroness Hurdett Coutts’ husband,
whose maiden name was Mr. Ashmead Bartlett,
and she met at dinner an influential Westminster
elector. Tnis gentleman was susceptible,-and had
ie recollection such generous beauties of old
time as Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who
kissed the butcher to get his vote. -‘You must
vote for Mr. Burdett-Coutts,” said Lady Randolph
Churchill. “ Well,” he replied, with a worshipplog
glance, “I can’t promise; but if I were treated as
voters used to be treated oy the canvassers in the
old days, I should possibly give in.” “ Oh, thank
you so much,” cried his fair and ready inter-
locutor; “I will let the Baroness know at once.”
In tussia, says Madame Greville, women
are not regarded as equals. Tbe peasant expee’s
his wife to plough, to harvest, to work like a beast
of burden. This would be comparatively nothing
if they were well treated and loved. The! r husbands
do love them, but in a peculiar fashion. For the
first two or three days after tbe wedding things go
on very well. That is, while families are exchang-
ing their visits. After that, the husband bea's his
wifi. and if he does not beat her, she thinks it is
because he does not xove her. Once, when I was
there, a girl who had been married only 10 days
came to me with her mother, and begged me to use
my influence with the newly-made husband. They
wanted me to make him beat the girl, according to
her situation as a wife. It was a long time before
I understood the reason. I found that it was
founded on jealousy. If a husband is not jealous,
he does not beat his wife; and if he is not jealous,
he does not love her.
Mrs. Langtry, at the recent private view
of the Grosvenor Gallery, looked charming, as,
indeed, she ever does. One thing about her which
always “fetched” one it her brightness. She is
always laughing, and her smile is like sunshine, it
positively breathes happiness. To some morbid
souls it is probably aggressively bright; but, as a
general rule, her brightness must be more than
half her charm, because her beauty, which is
wonderful, would not account for all her popu-
larity, or for the intense pleasure which it gives
one just to see her. She wore a vtr/ magnificent
mantle of sealskin trimmed with otter, covering
her from head to foot. Her hat was of gold em-
broidery on brown, and was trimmed with sable.
It was a toque, high, but not too high. Her hair
was simply tied behind, and allowed to fall in the
nrettlest, simplest way imaginable. She dresses
herself very nerfectly; in a style sufficiently
original to be characteristic, and yet never with a
shade of anything like ostentation.
A Bill giving the franchise to women has,
the cable tells us, passed its second reading in the
House of C immons Which reminds one that the
reason why the Victorian Parliament gives so much
attention to the wrongs of barmaids, and the dis-
comforts of factory girls, &r., is that thinking
people in the colony see that they are rapidly
approaching a time when women will rule the
position. For while there are in N S.W. 100,445
marriageable men to 84 270 marriageable women,
there are in Victoria only 99 867 marriageable men
to 119,378 marriageable women. Or. while there
are in Victoria to every 10 000 single men 11,954
single women among whom they may cho* se,
there are to that number of single men in N.S.W.
only 8390 single women, in Queensland only 6158
and in Western Australia omy 5575, or nearly two
men to each woman. The Victorian Government
statist says that women would appear to hive a
smaller chancn of getting manjnd m Vlctoriathan
m any other Australasian colony. A 8 dney paper
anticipates that when women shall have become
• bosses” of the politicU situation, a Reform Bill
will be introduced to deprive men of the fran-
chise.
BY FLOOD AND FIELD .
Friend Larry, the ring e’en in these cul-
tured days has some one to warble a line in its
praise. What matter though Heunan and Sayers
be dead, and Lang ham’s game spirit to Heaven has
lied-the grit that waved proudly the "birds
eye” of yore, is still in our country as thelr’sto
the fore. So let us step into the 16-foot ring, and
bang on yonr knocker the song we woulo sing.
Shall we chirrup a line in the praise of Bob Pee, or
tell how Long Sandy “ done ” Billy Magee ? Shall
we call old Tom Curran to step to the front, and
tell us how Sellars with him bore the brunt of a
long fist encounter (no gloves in those days) I Aye,
Larry, since then “ pugs.” have altered their
ways: no fights now as then for a fiver aside when
into the air flew skin, gristle, and nide. No four
hours’ bold struggle to see who was best, but
three minutes’ fighting and one minute's rest
But what sort, old pal, why thus chirrup in song
the deeds of the game ’uns, the clever and strong ?
Mat. Hardy, M'Laren, Joe Kitchen, that push,
those " goats” hid their light in a gooseberry bush,
but you, game as glyc’rine, fronting us stand,
and as you can licit us, wny, Lawrence, your hand I
But singing is ary work, and, Larry, suppose we
jerk up the metre and drop into prose. On Satur-
day night. at Foley s Gymnasium, George-street,
Sydney, there was a "critical audience” (see
daily papers) to witness the kaocking-o at matches,

dot more so, than had each iadivdual onlooker
been there and shown ho* dexterously (joae) and
dettly he could guard his front. We felt that way,
but La*, our front - [W 11 you kindly tell us what
happened on Saturday night— Ed. B] The draw
of the evening was a match between Seale and
the Bogan champion. We were on the Bogan
years ago, when a glass of water was worth a
shilling, and a glass of (excised, no duty) worth a
sovereign’s tenure of a crown, and we know any
man who wants to be champion of the Bogan can
be so. Taere were only two waiting when we
Ibf t, and the other had got bald-headed, waiting for
a chance to “ cop” the “companionship.” We are
glad he left first, else we had got the belt, and tae
belting which he got on Saturday night. But—
the opening struggle was between Prof. H. M.
Cansdell and a pair of Indian clubs, in which the
former had decidedly the best of a well-contesced
battle. Fuller and Smith (late Caring-ton)—but
fat Fuller’s earth was too good lor the
Lord’s Kingdom, and when the four rounds were
finished the Lord's namesake had gone all to pieces
—the Smith was as myth, Nolan and Mackay
fought a good show fight. No one was hurt
except Cansdell (Nolan trod on his toe), and when
they retired M Kenna and Magnus had a turn-up—
a sort of turn up and let us fight, you know—a
salad encounter In which neither had tbe best of
it, though both men had the advantage at the
finish. [Of retiring without the ambulance he
means.—Ed B] Then followed the fight of the
evening. Seale, a fair-haired, hazel-eyed youth
with a melancholy expression and a long reach,
met the Began champion. The man from the
B )gao, who had lived on locusts and wild honey,
whale’s blubber and shark’s teeth, and chewed the
ears off native dogs for fun, was “ on the worry,”
but tbe native was “on the shor'd*- r.” The shoul-
der Is the ticket, after all—it carries weight. Seale
had two shoulders and two arms, and thrice armed
for-
Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel j ust,
But put up gilt on him whose left nand’s “fust.”
After Jack Thompson announced the winner the
audience retired, and will not hold their cheek
tickets good at Foley’s till next Saturday night.
Till then, boys, allons.
The high northerly wind on Saturday last
raised an even worse dust storm than usual on the
road to the Canterbury (Sydney) Race Club meet-
ing. We have before pointed out tbe mistake
made by the committee in starting the first raoa
at half-past 1 o’clock, and we believe a big im-
provement could be made in the attendance by
starting the sport at an hour which would give the
general public a chance of reaching the ground in
time for the beginning. Young Kelso, on Elling-
ton in the February Handicap, had his first mount
since his unfortunate accident in George-street.
The Opening Handicap set the ball roiling, a d
was won by Leumeah, Speculation half a length
away second, Surry third. Sawdust started
favourite for the Selling Race, at 5 to 4, but she
was compelled to play second fiddle to Ai ista, who
won In a canter by 10 lengths Leumeah made a
second win in the February Handicap, which she
secured with a length to the goo 3 from Roobie.
Activity won the Sapling Stakes by a lengtd from
Mia Mia; and a day’s good racing was brought to
a close by Kingston appropriating the Welter
Handicap from Roobie by half a length. Amongst
th? jockeys, Fielder and English divided the cake
by a couple of wins each.

Since last writing;, a change has come o’er
the constitution of the N.S.W. Eight-oar crew,
the ever-popuiar M.R.C. man, Mr. S. H. Martin
having finally decided that business matters will
preclude him from taking a thwart—or perhaps,
in these days of sliding saats, we would be more
correct in saying a seat in the boat. This will
prove a great knock to the crew, as Mr Martin is
one of the best oarsmen N.S.W. can produce. By
some means a rumour was started in the city list
week that Mr. Webster would take his place, but
we can safely say there is no truth la the report
At tae time of writing, we cannot hear anything
definite as to who tbe eighth man will be, but in all
probability Mr. J. A. Brodie will take the vacant
place—and very properly, too, for his performance
with an oar have shown him worthy of inclusion
in any crew. The crew last week, with Mr.
Martin, did a spin in good form, and they are
booked for practice this week, but unfortunately
too late for notice in this issue.

The proposed meeting between Foley and
Newton has “gone burg,' and this is the last that
will bo heard about the affair—at least, so far as tins
journal is concerned. Foley has now given way
In every point, with the exception of promuiog
not to hurt his opponent, and Newton has shown
he is not to ha drawn. Newton has made a point
of Foley declining to sign tbe articles and forward
them to Melbourne, but Foley "put up” the
money with J. D. Young, and the “sugar ’ is the
binding point about these matches, for without It
the articiei are mt worth the paper they are
written on. The old-time saying amongst snorts-
men of “ put up, or sbut up,” is expressive, if not
elegant, and we strong y commend it to Mr New-
ton’s notice. If the Melbournian meant business,
Foley’s offer of £lOO to Newton it the Victorian
proved victorious, or £5O even in the event of
Newton’s defeat, would navp been fairly snapped
up. Hereendeth the Foley-Newtoa controversy.

Those dashing and venturesome sports-
men, the Sydney Association Lawn-Tennis team,
psid Newcastle a visit on Saturday last, when they
engaged a local team in the deadly s’nfe. The
game was of an unusually rough aad brutal
character, but the Sydney nun were not to be
denied, and won by 16 sets to 4, and 104 games to
go. So far the banks have not issued »n order to
tie effect that lawn-tenols players Injured during
play will not be kept in the Infirmary at the
banks’ expanse, as was recently given forth in the
case of the footballers, but after Saturday s reck-
less play v e should not be surprised to hear sor e
such course had bean adopted.

Last week when we gave it as our opinion
that no handicap in reason would bring the Electra
on an equality with the Waitangi, we little
th ingot we shou d so soon have to eat our words.
Pur tae rate for a 1 yachts ia connection with the
Prince Allred Yacht Club, sailed over a comse
from the French buoy at Neutral Bay, round the
R.S. Y.S. buoy at Manly, round shark Island, Port
Denison, L’gnt-shlp, Sow and Pigs, Shark Is and,
and back to flagboat off Fort Macquarie, the fol-
lowing yachts put In an appearance;-The Wai-
tangal, 21 tons, Mr, A. G. Milson, scratch; Sirocco,
10 tons, Mr. B. W. Knox, 9m. 145.; Electra, 21 tons,
Mr. J. P. Pltzhardinge, 10m. 385.; Assegai, 6 tons,
Mr. G.F, Murnin, 16m. 205.; Tritonia, 4 tons, Mr.
Mr. F. Ward, 22m. 44s ; Ruby, 0 tons, Mr. A.
A. Griffiths, 25m. The handicap was by the
new sRI-area classification, which, by the way,
does not appear to find favour with the yacht
owners. The race was virtually between he
Waitanglaad Electra, as the other yachts one by
one carried away or drooped out or the race. A
regui»r Dlack-un from the northward stood the
Electra in good stead with her small sails, and she
led round Bhark Island the second time, but in the
run home the Waltangi passed and finished
sseo. ahead of the yawl, whica takes the prize on
time allowance.

The smaller fry were hard at it also on
Saturday. The Balmain Sailing Club had a handi-
cap for halt-deckers, 20ft, and 22ft. Tne race
proved particularly lively, as the Triton and
Elaino capsized, the Clytie filled up to the thwarts,
and the Buttercup throwing up the sponge, left
the Nereus and Genesta to fight it out to the bitter
end. The little clipper Nereus had to allow tbe
Genesta half a minute, but tbe last named took the
lead from the start, and out-sailing her rival, won
bysomeSmia. The Genesta is George Ellis’last
creation, to the order of Mr. Cameron, and on
Saturday last was steered to her victory by her
builder, who may be congratulated upon showing
tbe way to the hitherto invincible Nereus. Mr.
Cameron has, no doubt, named his little clipper
alter the yacht which recently went over from
England to d j battle in America Genesta is the
scientific na ue for the common broom plant. Mr
Cameron D evidently tired of the seas sweeping
over his old love, the Sophia, and is going to try
and sweep the seas with his 20-footer, He has
begun well.

A big crowd put in an attendance at the
Agricultural Ground on Saturday last, whe.c
Malone and O’Brien met lor £lO3 and tbe cham-
pionship over three distances—half-mile, 1000yds.,
of a mile. Malone won the first
two events and the match with the greatest ease
in 2min., and 2min. 24sec. respectively. O’Brien
was unable to extend the winner. We understand
the committee of the ground have not quite agreed
with their secretary in the holding of a pro-
fessional race meeting on the ground. This is
rather rough on the secretary, who has worked
like a nigger to out some money in the hands of
the society. In England agricultural grounds are
much favoured by pedestrians, and we cannot see
what objection can hold against foot-racing if
carried out under proper management. As the
Botany track is now prepared and in good order,
it is probable the committee will have no need to
discuss the question. We cannot compliment the
managers of Saturday s sport on their arrange-
ments.

The proposed races between the English
and American runners, George and SmPh, are
“ off.” Myers states he is unwilling to give up
either his amateur standing, or his membership in
the Manhattan Athletic Club Amateurs’ lines
do not fall in pleasant places when they change
their status to that of professional. George re-
ceived a good drubbing in his line; and Robinson,
who was amateur champion boxer of the Olympic
i Club, ’Frisco, made his debut as a pro., and re-
-1 ceived a drubbing from Joan L. Sullivan at one
and the same time.

From the N.Y. Herald “ The yacht
Galatea’s challenge for the ‘ America ’ Cup having
been accepted, Mr. Edward Burgess, of Boston,
the designer of Puritan, has made arrangements
for the building of a new yacht for General Payne,
whica, it is expecte , will be the defender of the
cup. Her modelling is something like that of
the Puritan, but she Is to be liner at entrance.
Her beam will he 22 3-10 ft.—the same as the Puri-
tan-and she will also have the same measurement
outside. Her ballast will be about 27 toes. Her
length over all will be 98ft, and on tne water line,
85ft. The depth of her bold is to be 9ft., and her
draught 83 10ft.—the same as the Puritan’s. The
work of construction begins at once. Lawley and
sons, of Boston, are bulioing her.” We are afraid
thera is too much chivalry about the Englishmen
for them ever to annex tne “Cup.” bir Richard
Sutton, of Genesta fame, allowed the Yankees to
take a point of him without appeal and was well
drubbed for his pains. It Will be remembered the
Puritan was on her wrong leg and tried to cross
the Genesta, when the latter poked her snout
through the Yankee s mainsail. The Genesta
could have run her down for her bit of pointing,
but the chivalrous Baronet kept her away and ran
under the Puritan’s stern.

The most noticeable feature of the junior
cup match between the Osbornes and Eastern
Suburbs was the excellent fielding of Nicholson
and the wicket-keeping of Wales for the former
club. Walts performance on Saturday was along
way ahead of anything we have been shown by
our first-class men behind the sticks.

The light skiff handicap for “ Smith’s

won ny T. Power, 151 b.: R. Matthews, 151 b., second.
Matthews, who is quite a lad, but rows remarkably
well, is the youngster who had the temerity to
tackle Messenger and Pearce at the last Balmain

We should like to see the N.Y. (U.S.) Crib

Rumour has it tnat the Sydney Amateur
Boxing Club Is not in quite a satisfactory state so
far as the matter of flltby lucre is concerned. In
fac‘, the garret near the sky where the club used
to hold its little reunions has been closed for some
time, and rumour also has it that a prominent
member had a very narrow escape of being locked
in with the paraphernalia and weighing machine
(the latter kindly lent by a too confiding member)
when tae landlord foreclosed. However, the

Messrs. Shaw and Shrewsbury recently
issued the following letter respecting a statement
made in an evening contemporary in re the Aus-
tralian team:—“lt is asserted, fortunately on
doubtful authority, that members of the Shaw-
Shrewsbury company will demand a minimum fee
of £2O per man for taking part in the England or
Players of England matches; and there is talk of
their requiring to rank as sharers with the pro-
prietors of the ground and the Australians. Will
you allow us to state that we have heard nothing
of such a demand, and do not for one moment
think that any of the members of our teau desire
anything of the kind. On the contrary, the know-
ledge that the Melbourne Club are the promoters
of the Australian team coming over is sufficient to
warrant them a hearty reception from all classes
of cricketers, whether amateur or professional.
Fur ourselves and James Lillywhite, we shall be
only too glad of the opportunity, if only in a small
degree, to repay them for the very kind and
generous treatment we received at their hands
when in Australia.”

Mr. William Blaikie, the author of the
well-known book on how to get strong, has re-
cently been emphasing the need of an even and
systematic athletic envelopment. He observes
that rowers are apt to be all chest, and no leg.
Mr. Blaikie must be of the old fixed-seat school,
and behind the age. It is very evident he knows
nothing of the working of a sllding-seat.

Thus a London sporting paper on a couple
of Cabbage Gardeners:—“Mr. L. L. bmith, who
has nominated an Australian horse for tne Eclipse
Stakes at Sandown, is a son of the well-known
amusement caterer, B. T. Smith, once commander-
in-chief at Drury Lane. L. L. Smith, in Melbourne,
is an advertising doctor, and dispenses remedies
in a style similar to that of the late Joe La Mert,
in England. Mr. ‘Joe’ Thompson, over whom
there was such a gush made by certain uninitiated
writers on the sporting press in England when he
visited us from Victoria, at one time in Mel-
b urne managed a dancing rendezvous not quite
so quietly organised as Bignell s Argyll Booms
were wont to be: but then distance pr babiy
lends enchantment to the prestige of colonial
visitors.”

S teeplechasing appears to be a more profit-
able game in France than in England, Australia, or
America, for in 1885 Baron Finot won upwards of
£20,000 in stakes, whereas the Due de Castries, who
heads the list of winning owners on tne flat, has
won lets than £15,000. most of wtich was pieaed up
in small amounts, principally at meetings in the
south of France.

Jack Dempsey, known in the States as the
“ Nonparis!,*’ has offered to fight the Englishman
Charles Mitchell, for £5OO, witn or without gloves’,

Lees and Farnan have put up £5O each for
) a match to come off in about six or seven weeks.
Farnan ought to have been contented with his
last adventure with Lees, but, no doubt, hopes on
this occasion to turn the tables. Laes is also
anxious to meet O’Brien for a stake of £2OO. All
the men are at present in Melbourne.

The three and four-round fat glove fights,
which find such favour amongst colonial and
American pugs., do not. as a rule, obtain to any
great extent in England, the home of the game of
knuckles. On January 4, Johnny Perkins and
Tom Smith, a par of “Brummagem buttons,”
fought a two-hours’ draw of 47rounds. Smith had
one of his jaws broken, and Perkins fought from
the 10th round with a fractured arm. The police
interfered early in the game, and the men re-
treateu, leaving the battle-field, ropes, and stakes
to the peace-makers. Subsequently, they pitched
another ring, and fought the battle to a finish as
above, neither man being able to answer the time-
keeper’s call.

others that are indispensable. These latter com-

Now is the winter of the Counter-skipper’s
discontent made glorious by the sunny smiles of
his fair cu tomers who having encouraged him to
tear down half bis shop sweetly enquire If he ‘hasn’t
g>t something just a shade lighter.’ And this re-
minds us that nothing bores the average husband
more than being eomptlled t® go into a milliner's
shop and stand ns still as a stump while his wife is
wading round in a sea of silks end satins. He’d
much rather stay out on the pathway, and wait —
even it it was half a mile to the next public house.
How different is the case when it is the pa iant
wife who is waiting while the husband is doing the
shopping. Nothing could ever tempt her to leave
the shop door, especially when her lord and master

There is not a single Roman Catholic in
the new Victorian Ministry, nor was there one in

that the No-Popery cry was raised in the southern

they will not, They have no apprehensions as to

The Bishop of Peterborough, writing in

persons an exceptional right to affirm, but he
would place all members of the Legislature on the
same level of plain and simple declaration or

The cable news of the projected attack by

Russia throughout the Balkan Question is directed

the plot, Russia would » ot speak so openly about

The new Coalition Ministry in Victoria

The recent wharf laborers’ strike is pic-
turesquely dealt with by a Sydney correspondent
in the Noumea L’lndependant. He does not go
with the men. He runs through their system of
organisation, of affiliation, of federation, and
shows how, when the men like, they can make
victims of the masters. He calls the principle
boycottism, and alleges that it has only to be
pushed a little farther in Australia, when to the
shipmaster who refuses the demands of the
labourer, the butcher will refuse meat, the baker
bread, the grocer tea, and the priest benediction.

Mr. J, F. Dorington has lately been made
a baronet of England by the Conservative party,
“ because he was an unsuccesslul candidate at last
election.” This is very funny. Heroditarv titles,
such as baronet, descend, on the presumption
(notoriously false, by the way), that descendants
will inherit the capacity of the first holder. There-
fore it may be assumed tfiat bjs honor was made
hereditary bi-cauae it was hoped that all Mr, D.’s
descendants would be unsuccessful candidates
for Parliament. Which shows that the Conserva- i
tives have an unflattering though not unjust estl-!
mate of the thick-headedness of some of their
devotees. Following this precedent, Sir
Salmon Wilson may now be created a peer, as his
attempt to get Into Parliament was such a lament-
able failure. With N.S.W. a different practice is
followed. Here they don’t make men Cs.M.G.
because they have failed to get into Parliament,
but because they have failed to do any good for
anyone but themselves after they have been
elected.
Hon. H. J. Wrixon, the Attorney-General
of the new Victorian Government, is a namby-
pamby politician, and a man who Indulges in
platitudes. The facetious David Gaunson terms
him “the lady member.” Mr. Wrixon was once
Attorney-General in Sir J=ts. M Culloch s Adminis-
tration, and although a good lawyer he is not a
particularly useful senator. Hardly any measure
ever pleases him, and he has a habit of finding
fault with almost everything. He is an able man
but rather narrow-minded on many questions, and
has the reputation of being honest and sincere.
Mr. Wrixon has nearly always voted with the
Conservative party, but that is probably owing to
the fact that he is a son-in-iaw of that wealthy and
ancient old Tory, the Hon. Henry Miller, of Mel-
bourne, better known as “ Money ” Miller.
If affairs continue as they now threaten
in Great Britain and Ireland, nothing will ap-
parently be left for the Government to do except
to go to war with the people. The Government
of Great Britain warring against the British
people would be a splendid spectacle. Not only
do the Irish refuse to pay rack-rents and the
Scotch crofters pass resolutions to resist by force
any body of police who might be sent to help pro-
cess-servers, but the Welsh farmers have also
determined to demand a reduction of rents. The
inhabitants Jof the London slums will be next to
move, we expect, and the Dukes of Westminster
and Bedford will be graciously offering a reduc-
tion of 10 per cent to tenants who pay 3s. 6d. per
week for one dirty room to accommodate seven
souls or so. One of these days the London sans-
culottes will catch the Dukes of Westminster and
Bedford and their respective wives and children,
and will put each family into one of their own
unventilated rooms, and shut the door for half an
hour. When the doors are re opened the West-
minster and Bedford titles will pass to distant re-
lat vea.
The British army contractor and his
superiors are as big scoundrels to-day as they
were 30 years ago. Here, from an English Tory
paper “It is not pleasant reading, this testing of
bayonets at Aldershot. The specials in the Soudan
told sad tales about the bayonets—how they broke
short, twisted, proved soft ; in other words,
neither weapons of offence or defence. For in one
instance, that of 323 out of 600 bayonets of the Ist
Battalion Lancaster Regiment to be found totally
unfit for service, and 168 to be soft and defective
out of 700 belonging to the Ist Scaforth High-
landers, argues something wrong somewhere. The
old 33rd, the Duke of Wellington’s Own, one of
the three regiments without facings, was in still
worse case. Not a bayonet was good : 50
‘broke,’3oo are described as ‘soft,’ and all set down
as ‘bad.’ No marvel, then, with cartridges that
‘jammed’ and bayonets that* broke,’ our casualties
were heavy in the Soudan.” German bayonets
don't bend. Vanity Fair writes:—“ With bayo-
nets of superior pewter; with musket ‘ejectors’
that won't eject; and with real jam in the way of
machine guns, It seems undeniable that several
people who are alive and presumably enjoying
themselves, require hanging.” [Are these the
weapons with wnich the grand old mother-country
armed the N.S.W Goat-slayers ?— Ed. B ]
The goody-goody element is pretty strong
in the new Victorian Government. The Com-
missioner of Public Works (John Nimmo)
is an intensely pious man, and an energetic
temperance apostle. The Commissioner of
Customs (Wm. Froggatt Walker) is a protege
of that religious organ, the Melbourne D.T.,
a disciple of the Salvation Army, a bigotted
teetotal advocate, and has always bitterly and
strenuously opposed the movement for the open-
ing of the museums and libraries on Sundays.
M. H. Davies (who holds a portfolio with-
out office, as his seat is not very safe) is
also a ranter and devil-dodger, although he
is a lawyer. He objects to the opening
of libraries and museums, and to the running of
Sunday trains, but he is only a Sabbatarian in the
sense that Cappadocians and Cretans were liars,
for it is not long since he headed a deputation to
the Victorian Railway Commissioners to get
Sunday trains run to the aristocratic suburb of
Malvern, where he owns property. Mr. Davies,
however, would never entertain the idea of
running Sunday excursion trains to the chief
centres of the colony for the benefit of the work-
ing classes. He would hold up his hands in holy
hoiror at any such suggestion. It is only men of
the Nimmo, Walker, and Davies psalm-singing
and Orange stamp, who succeed in getting into the
Legislature down south now-a-days.
John James, who has just take the port-
folio of Mines in the Victorian Coalition Govern-
ment, is a blacksmith by trade, and lives in
Ballarat Bast, which he has represented for about
15 years. He is a Wesleyan local-preacher, and
has besm a follower of the Berry-Smith party from
the beginning, but not the sort of follower always
convenient to those gentlemen, John having a
will of his own, and not choosing to duck under in
everything. On one occas on a caucus was held in
which John rose and objected to the domineering
of Major (now Colonel) Smith, remarking that
there was too much Major for his stomach. Upon
this the wrathful warrior threatened to throw
this non-fighting Methodist through the window,
which roused the old Adam in John’s sledge-
hammer arm. He felt the biceps, and found
they were not yet soft, gad advanced in
the lornf of a hollow square, and-the
warrior—well, the warrior changed the subject.
He was Chairman of Committees for three years;
is a teetotaller, but had his revenge for it by lear •-
log to smoke at 43. He.is an honourable, capable,
good-tempered man, popular amongst the
miners, and familiar with their wants. His
appointment, however, will not be relished by the
Colooel, who, with J B. Patterson and others, are
laying around for a chance to have a slap at any-
thing that will give them the leading place they
had in the Berry rdgirpe. We wish John luck of
his £l5OO a year, and are sure that where there is
work to be done he will go at it hammer and
tongs.
Theebaw is deposed, his territory is
annexed, and the British flag waves over
one more conquered race. England has dill-
gently prepared the way for her last bit of terri-
torial aggrandisement for y®ars by representing
Theebaw as a brandy and blood thirsty ruffian of
the deepest dye. In years to com® a man will
griss and make a book, and the book will be
written to prove that Theebaw was a grossly-
maligned individual, who shuddered if a fly
knocked its head against a window-pane, and who
never drank anything stronger than water
flavoured with a peppermint lozenge. All the
wicked sovereigns and bloodthirsty tyrants of the
past have, one by one, been proved to have been
angels upon earth. Herod was so devoted to
calidren that he would play “ mulberry bush ”
with ragged little boys and girls in the public
streets. Nero, instead of fiddling while Rome was
burning, wss rushing about with hand-grenades
endeavouring to put the flames out, and rescuing’
a cat and her kittens from a top storey at the risk
of his life. King Richard 111. had taken buns and
sugar-caady to his jn the Tower, when
they fell upon him and tried to throw him down

Dan. O Conaor no more. Hardly had he learned
how to wear "the Victoria Cnss of public life”
before it was rudely snatched from him and given
to a man who never meatier s the glories of
Ancient Greece and Rome, and is only ordinarily
reverent to the “Mimory of William Char-r-rles
Wmtworth. Temporg mutantur. But one short
month since, the adulations of the effusive Yeung
who managed to ladle out praise to the guest of
the evening and to himself in just about equal
quantities, were ringing through the corridors of
the Town Hall, and the exalted Dan., in reply, said
everything in praise of himself that the host
had forgotten to mention. And now the prize
has passed from bis grasp, and the bald
fact remains that the model Minister who
could "talk a hurricane”; the Minister who
mastered the details of his office down to the rat
question within the space of one fortnight is not
considered good enough for a place in the coali-
tion. The coalition must be overflowing with blt-
terne?s for the only " orathor” in the Assembly.
What use for Sir John to tell h's la*e colleague
that Plain Bill has been talren onto do the skiting?
Plain Bill naver says anything of Wentworth and
those nations of antiquity. In the expulsion of
Dan. from office the only pleasure can be to the
public generally. Dan. goes out, and we have bis
banquet pledge— in vino veritas - Hut he will take
care that the Postil Department is administered in
future by a capable man. Can it be—surely not -
but yet it might, that he refused office under the
coalition, in order to carry out this pledge ? If so
he has developed a new virtue—the virtue of
modesty.
HE’S NEVER SPOKEV SINCE.
The great Dan. at the banquet stood,
Last Jan. the twenty*-third.
And made a grand oration, such
As ne’er before was hearl:
With bitter scathing ire ny
He made the Pressmeelwinee,
But—thankfully we note;the fact—
He’s never spoken since.
He deftly skipped from Ancient Greece
To modern pork and lard,
And told what trustful friends he met
When times with him were hard;
His periods were neatly turned,
His action was “ imminse,”
But thanks to all our patron saints,
He’s never spoken since.
He sat within the Senate Hall,
When fierce word-conflicts raged,
But not a single “ spache ” of his
The Pressman’s pen engaged.'
’Tls rumoured that his chief had said,
That Dan.’s great “ eloquinoe ”
Would “ bust the Ministry to bits
He’s never spoken since.
No more shall Post officials quake
Beneath Dan.’s searching eye—
No more shall lightning-dodgers bend.
When he walks proudly by.
He’s worn the bright Victoria Cross
Of public life; but—plain
Enough it is to all but Dan—
He never will again.

[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When centuries have come and tied,
Arid in accord with Nature’s strange
And wondrous law of utter change,
This city once so great is dead;
When brick has given place to stone,
And stone has crumbled into dust;
When gaud's have gone to moth and rust,
Which now might deck a monarch’s throne;
Then learned men, whose pleasures lie
•In solving secrets of the past,
Will hover round and stop at last
Beside a spot 1 now descry,
And try, but always try in vain,
With doubt and vague uneasiness,
A certain subtle greasinees
Which spreads around them, to explain.
.Oh 1 were I there by Holy Rood,
At once I’d settle their debate,
And prove it to them clear and straight,
’Twas there mine old-time hash-house stood.
DYSPEPSLUM G. BILE.
The New York Times follows the dead
millionaire, Vanderbilt, to hia costly tomb with a
curious calculation of what might be done with
his fortune of 300.000.t00 of silver dollars; for
Instance, put lengthwise, they would stretch 4073
miles; piled on each other, they would reach a
height of 355 miles; laid flat upon the ground, they
would cover 60 acres; their weight in ma s would,
be 7160 tens, requiring 358 cars for transportation;,
In dollar bills, laid lengthwise, they would reach
nearly around th© earth; made into a book, it
would be 13 miles thick; spread upon the ground,
they would cover 746 acres. All of which, from
the Times’ point of view, seems marvellous. But
when considered from other points of vision
M 00,000,000 is but an insignificant pot of dust; and
when compared with other and more useful
things, cuts but a contemptible figure in this
world’s affairs, and no figure at all in that other
life where sucb treasures never reach. All the
gold of the world is estimated at 56,1C0,000,000, and,
if pure and oast into a solid mass, its dimensions
would form a cube the sides of which would not
exceed 36 feet and three quarters of an Inch, it
could be placed in an ordinary room or two. If
the Vanderbilt millions had been cast Into a solid
oup of gold, we could have put it into our cnaUbm .
The heart beats 70 times per minute, or 3,577 204,000
in the 70 years allotted for the life of millionaires,
and all Vanderbilt s money could not hive pur-
chased a single heart-beat- The human lungs are
in that time inflated 690.526 800 times, and if Van-
derbilt had bad the breath kicked out of him by a
forty-dollar mule, all his wealth could not have
purchased a simile respiration. Antony had
squandered £175 000.000, and at the time of the
assassination of Caesar was in debt £3,500,000. The
nresent population of the earth is 1424,00 000.
Vanderbilt’s wealth divided among them would
have furnished seven cents apiece. The area of
the earth’s surface Is 197,000.000 of square miles.
Vanderbilt’s wealth would have placed but one
dollar on each mile. A single valuable gem-sap-
nhlre— weighing a little ovtr six ounces, is valued
at over £3,000,000. All the money of the Vander-
bilt estate would not equal a pure diamond that
might be worn upon the bosom of the most
worthless woman that ever Jived. The total
bonded debt of the civilised world is £15,000.000 000.
Add the debts of India, China, and Jap in,
and it is increased another thousand millions.
The national debt of tbe United States is about
£360 000 000, and it can all be printed upon one
bond with coupons attached, at a cost not exceed-,
\ntr to cents, and of an intrinsic value not worth a
nlokel Two hundred millions is a large amount
In dollars, and given great power to the Jiving man
who controls it, but when ne dies does not furnish
an obolus under his dumb, dead tongue to pay
Charon to ferry him across the Styx to the shadows
f that other world where wealth Is dross. Van-
darhilt lived and died, and left the world no better
for his existence. Around his memory Unger
hnrnev traditions, anecdotes of his avarice, and an
utter want of human sympathy. His wealth has
niirohased for him the gratitude of no poor and
unfortunate ones. His mansions on Fifth Avenue
“?fi time be turned into palaces of merchandise.
His body, watched and guarded till it shall have no
commercial value, will fill a space in its sarco-
ShSruf and the richest man in the world will be
bv all but his heirs, and only remem-
bered them for the money he left them. What
ffood thls rich man might have done with his vast
accumulations had he been possessed of
ffonflrnin emotions, and not been consumed
Sritto the vain ambition of founding a family
iri which ifrthcre shall be found a soldier, scholar,
or gentleman, ever a hero, statesman, or phllan-
throplst. he will be ashamed of the stock upon
which he has been grafted. We can suggest ever
so many uses to which the Vanderbilt two bun-
Sr™? millions of dollars might have been appra-
«Wated that would have increased his length of
promoted the happiness of the social circle
n? which be was the head, contributed to the
nleasure of multitudes of his fellow-creatures,
mSSeteo world better, left to him an honorable
niace in tlie World’s memory, inscribed his name
among those who loved his fellowmon, carried
him St across the valley of the shadow of
Siath and of all the golden stools he could have
totfSneof the most comfortable, of all the golden
hS'rnß hlawould have been attuned to the sweetest
and of all the halos shining about the heads
rtrcl® the great white throne his would have
town the one most brilliant.
we read in a contemporary that “The Syd-
ney Scottish Rltlea are rapidly increasing in numbers
owing to the inspiriting strains from the pipers.”
It may be true. There may be people so consti-
tuted, but we cannot refrain from quoting in this
conjunction a paragraph from an old letter which
we received from a friend in England shortly after
the Ashantee war. He refers to the reception of
the Black Watch at Southampton on their return,
and says:—“The loeal poet of the place was pre-
sent, and read a poem on ‘ Music,’ composed for
the occasion, in which occurred the following:—
. . . ‘ The Ashantees tied dismayed
When Scotland’s bagpipes thro’ their forests
played.'
And as he (the local poet) was a McO wen, he could
not have bpen joking.”
A paragraph in a Melbourne paper states
that “considerable excitement is felt in Tallan-
gatta, a township 35 miles from Wodonga, conse-
quent on the reports which have been received
that a wild man in a nude condition with his body
covered with long hair, has been seen on the Koe-
tong Ranges. It la asserted by several persona
that they saw the man as described sitting be.
tween two fires, and that when observed ho made
off into the scrub, uttering loud yells.” Poor fol-
low 1 This is what too much but no matter*
These .lernei. canvassers are much too enterpris-
ing. They should confine themselves to this side
of the Murray. People on this side are more ac
customed to them, and are not so easily frightened
when they make their appearance suddenly. We
hope that Alfred, who, we see, has just returned
from Europe, will not be angry with us for giving
him this friendly hint. It is done Simply in a
spirit of pure good nature.
Men who “go down to the sea in ships are
gay dogs.” So far as some of the officers of the mer-
cantile marine are concerned, the little stretch of
water between Australia and England is a verit-
able Salt Lake. Erom time to time we have beard
through the medium of the divorce courts a deal
about the doings at sea of amorous captains and
their frivolous assistants; but a complete record,
extenuating nothing, of life on a certain very
popular and fashionable ocean-liner trading be-
tween Port Jackson and London docks, would
make each particular hair of the moral public
stand on end. If even a little of what is said can
be believed, the officers of that sbip are flies in the
matrimonial ointment of one or two of the richest
men in Australia, whoso better halves-no wonder
—have grown very fond of voyaging by sea, and
“ travel ” very much faster than any steamer. Wo
are reminded of all this by the shocking dis-
closures last week in the case of the unfortunate
girl Marion Williamson, who, on the voyage be-
tween Townsville and Normanton, in a coasting
steamer,threw herself overboard and was drowned.
The girl was travelling as a steerage passenger,
and was seen to fall overboard by another pas-
senger, who Instantly gave the alarm. The boats-
wain, it is alleged, interposed ; “ Don’t make a
noise about it; hold your tongue,” The chief
mate, on being asked to stop the ship by a pas-
senger, is stated to have said : *• No, I won’t; it’s
too late now.” The captain received information
of the circumstance, and Instantly stopped and
made a search which, however, proved fruitless.
The lady passenger who occupied the same berth
as deceased stated that the girl frequented the
second engineer's cabin, and was with that officer
some time before her disappearance. The Queens-
land Attorney-General, in a minute upon the
depositions taken at an enquiry, regrets that he
cannot reach the second engineer by the criminal
law, and thinks that, if the evidence of the wit-
nesses is credible, others of the officers should be
prosecuted. This story of cold-blooded man-
slaughter is so horrible as to be almost beyond
belief.

(EKV&IfS))EBIIITY
nr HERE are many men in this colony who are,
'n day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, through early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It Is to those that this adver-
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering bin existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full erjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege -
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the So-called
Remedies, hut without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopelrsr invalid. If
such be your calamity, know that your case can
be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this Invaluable Medicine, which will, m the
short space of Four ‘Weeks, render you capable
of appreciating and Enioying t-ifu.
This valuable remedy affords relief, and perma-
nently cures all who suffer from Wasting and
Withering of the Nervous and Muscular Tissues,
Spermatorrhoea, and all Urinary Deposits, which
cAuse incapacity and degeoeracy, total and partial
prostration, and every other exhaustive derange-
ment of the system-regenerating all the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfil his most sacred obligations.
The directions are very simple, end require no
restraint or hindrance from business. 1 amphlets

AYER’S
Hair Vigor
restores, ■with, the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color, or deep black, as maybe desired.
By its use light or red hair may he darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled ; it contains neither oil
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
Mr O. P. Bricher writes from Kirby, 0..
July 3, 1882 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
failing out, and in a short time 1 became
nearly bald. I used part of a bottle of
AYER’S Hair Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a new growth. I
have now a full head of hairjrowmg vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but tor tue
use of your preparation I should have been
entirely’bald.”
j w. Bowen, proprietor of the McArthur
{Ohio) Enquirer, says : “ Ayer’S HAm ViGOR
is a most excellent preparation fox the ban.
1 speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new ban, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sure cure for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.” ,
Mr. Angus Fairbairn, leader of the
celebrated “Fairbairn Family of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Mass., Eeb. b,
1880 : “Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
time procureth, I have used Ayer s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness—a, matter ot
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
iu the eyes of the public.”
Mrs. O. A. Prescott, writing from 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
“ Two years ago about two-thirds of my hair
came off. It thinned very rapidly, and I was
fast growing bald. On using Ayer s Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regularly used but one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
\\r e have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the most skepti-
cal of its value.

DR. SCOTT'S ELECTRIC HAIR CURLER
AND
TOOTH BRUSH.
Ladies or Gentlemen who wish to quickly and
fashionably dress, crimp or curl the hair, beard
or moustache, by a new method, or to possess
sound, white teeth and rosy gums are invited
to read the brief but interesting descrip-
tion of these new inventions
Dr. SCOTT’S
Electric Appliances are now
sold and well known in
every part of the world
and are guaranteed
by the Pall Wall

Association.
GREAT
ANNOYANCE
has been caused
to all people using
tooth brushes by the
bristles coming out in
the mouth. The Pall
Mall Electric Associ-
ation now take pleasure
in introducing to the Aus- .
tralian public a Tooth Brush, which they
guarantee free from this troublesome defect.
The bristles are inserted in the handle by a
patent process, which renders it simply
impossible to come out in use. In ad-
dition to tMS, the handle of the Brush is
made of a newly invented material perma-
nently charged with an electro-magnetic
current, which acts without any shock
immed lately upon the nery.es and tissues
cf the teeth and gums. The act of
brushing causes this current to flow
into the nerve cells and roots of
the teeth, and, like water poured
upon a plant, it invigorates and
vitalizes every part, arresting
decay, building up and re-
storing the natural white-
ness of the enamel and
quickly producing
healthful, rosy-
coloured gums.
The handle is strong,
beautifully polished,
not affected by acids,
impervious to
moisture, aud free
from that un-
pleasant musty
odour exu-
ding from
wet hone
handles.

“ Mount Best,
“Bowral, N.S.W.,
“ 18th December, 1885.
“My dear Mr. Ives —
“ l am writing this to congratulate you and your
family upon your arrival in these sunny lands,
and to express the hope that as ..he Australian
manager of H. fl. Warner and Co/s safe remedies*
you may meet with the success that their merits
so richly deserve.
“Asa public man, who has had to do with large
masses of people, and I trust enjoyed their con-
flaence, my endorsement and testimonial have
frequently been solicited for remedies of various
kinds, but I have always and firmly refused,
though doubtless some were of real worth.
“ However, in the case of H. H. Warner's Safe
Cure, knowing personally the honourable charac-
ter of the firm, and the intrinsic value of the
medicine, and believing that 1 shall be conferring
a great berulit on many sufferers, I am willing
that you shall make whatever use of my expe-
rience and testimonial that you may see fir,
“ Early in the year 1880,1 had a severe attack of
Illness, caused by liver complaint and general
debility, produced by my mental and platform
labours, and I thought that my work as a teinpe-
ranee reformer was at an end,
"At “AS? tIc » , . ti S 1 ®' 1 * ad P ut into my hand a

Its use, experiencing relief from the start, and was
speedily restored to my usual health, and con-
tused so until, la the year 1883, when, in the
midst of a world of work in England, I was again
prostrated by my old enemy. I made application
at once for a case of the Safe Cure, and was sup-
plied from the London branch of the house, and
experienced the same results as at first, I have
since kept the remedy in the house, but I am
thankful to say have had no occasion to use it.

SLADENESQUE.
We were looking oyer the latest—it would
be fantastic folly to say the last—volume of poems
from the ever-flowing- lyric spout of Sladen, the
great N.S.W. poet, the Bard of the Rabbit-drive,
the other day. There is in it a large amount of
ihat paralysing quality which Mr. Dariey, Q.C.,
Once described as "wholesome fun." Here, for
Instance, is a specimen. Mr. Sladen entitles it,
"The Sigh of the Shouter.” This is how the
“ Shouter” sighs
Give me the wealth I have squandered in “ shout-
Infer.”
Scattered in sixpences, paid by the pound.
Ladled out glibly—no grudging or doubting,
Never a thought of the use to be found.
Where are the hours that I wasted so gaily,
Drinking and laughing in front of tho bar—
Hours that I spent in more indolence dally.
Heedless of how it my future might mar ?
Gone, as the sun of the summer has vanished;
Woe with the winter in hurrying in,
Woe for the waste that can never be banished,
Gone Is the glitter, but stayeth the sin.
We wonder how much Mr. Sladen knows of
"shouting” to mourn over its consequences so
melodiously. Not much, we reckon. A man who
is so generous of his rhymes as he is is rarely gener-
ous with anything else. We do not, however,
doubt that he has “shouted” occasionally, and,
therefore, speaks from experience. If so it must
have been for deadbeats who had to be bribed
with beer to listen to his poems. Thunder, what a
lot of money it must have cost him, and how
drunk he must have made his audiences 1 But we
don’t suppose there is anything in this theory
even. Mr. Sladen is the kind of man who evolves
from internal consciousness. He could as easily
identify himself with the internal consciousness
of a tank or a boiler and evolve a soliloquy from
either as a country editor could evolve several
hew kinds of snakes and a week in the hospital
out of a keg of rum. It is only fair, however 5 ,
that we should give him something in return for
having borrowed his poem. Hereunder there is a
companion lyric, which he is at liberty to print
with it in his next edition if he chooses. Let’s see.
tee.
The Sigh of the Shouter.
Givd ihe the time I have squandered in spouting
Dredge-loads of drivelling I Give me the time
I have siting away, flung away* wasted in clouting
My asinine skull for abortions of rhyme I
Where are the lyrics and ode) I have written—
Clenching my teeth in the dead of the night—
Recklessly printed, and as one mad-dog bitten,
Reckless of whom he may kill with his bite ?
Cone, as the bray of an ass when he brayeth;
Bead as the corpse in the hurrying hearse;
Gone, and I know it, but with me still stayeth*
As slck’ning as ever, my vomit of verse.
Hem J we think that will do very nicely as a com
panion poem to Mr. Sladen'B. We would suggest*
If he should see his way to uso it, that he should
have it printed on the page opposite his own
poem. It will give a certain amount of variety to
tlho volume. But we have not yet done with this
entrancing work. Mr. Sladen has some lines about
“The Boet,” which begin as under;—
Thb Poet.
Poet writing, feels nor heat nor cold.
Nor thirst, nor hunger, as he doth unfold,
While his rich mind is open from its hoard,
The gorgeous pageantry with which it’s stored,
Winter or summer outside matters notl
Well, there may be such poets, but we have never
met them. We have met some who may not have
£elt hunger when writing* but the poet has yet to
be Constructed by a special miracle who does not
feel thirst. Many a poet we have seen—and a very
good poet at that—whe has been as proud as a
policeman when he has had a tank to himself to
live in and a certainty of ninepence a day to spend
in corned beef and rum. Yet none of these have
ever informed us that they disregarded " heat or
bold, or thirst Or hunger,” in their finest frenzies.
No, Mr/ Sladen, it is one thing to write of these
things In Turkey slippers and a Persian dressing-
gown with a Coal fire in winter and an ice-chest in
Summer, three meals a day “ reg’ler,” and a cellar-
lul of bottled beer and whisky, and another thing
to write of them when they are all around you
Try it some day, and see. If the experience does
not kill you it will, perhaps, improve your verse
and save you from killing others. We wish you
good night and better dreams than you have given
us many a time.
All London dogs have now to wear
muzzles. But they have not been long In eduoa*
ting themselves up to the situation. They wear
their muzzles loose round their necks, and directly
they see a policeman coming they put their nose
into them and muzzle themselves.
Alluding to the baby’s well-known habit
Of putting in its mouth everything within reach,
a Sydney journal says “ When they grow older
they quickly learn to distinguish sweetcakes from
bread, or beer from water.” We re convinced that
the writer of the above would distinguish the
liquids at a tender age, and that the present inter-
mittent water supply causes him no incon-
venience.
A dock labourer was charged at the
Greenwich police court (Eng), witti having ill-
treated a cat and assaulted tne police. He was
fondling the cat outside the Centurion Hotel,
Deptford, and took it into the hotel. Subsequently
he returned to the sidewalk, and remarked the
kitten’s leg was broken. He then bit its head off
and kieked the remains into the gutter. It re-
quired four policemen to take the prisoner to the
look-up, and he stated en route that he could bite
a child’s head off as easily as a cat’s. He wss
sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. And
yet We send missionaries to Borneo, and soldiers
to the Soudan. Let us, brethren, send a few
Chinese converts to England on a revival racket.
The Sydney Freeman's Journal says tbat
—“The sanctuary of St. Ann, in Canada, was
Visited last year by 64,000 persons. The miracles
wrought at this shriue are accepted to be many
and great.” In the matter of miracles, Australia
has a real grievance. We don’t know a single
place from Cape York to Hobart where a person
could go with a fair chance uf seeing anything
out of the common; while there’s scarcely a vil-
lage in Italy, Spain, or Ireland, where any Sunday-
school child, after a full moal, can't go into
the woods and see ihe Virgin percned on the
branch of a tree. We’ve been to Knock, and have
aeen the whole heavenly choir pass one by one on
the church gable before us. More would have
passed, but that the slides ran out. In German
Alsace last year there was a well where Bt. Peter
appeared and opened business for the cure of
bunions at 10 francs a head. But M.Bismarck sent
a file of Prussian soldiers, and the saint gave up—
couldn’t stand the opposition. Dreadful down

tne Sydney School were from drawings
dragon-fly with a hand-net, especially when there’s
a railway to be crossed with an express train turn-
ing the corner. The knowledge acquired by pur-
suing at the same time science, spiders, and safety
is seldom forgotten. It was found, however, that
as the club s youthful members of both sexes in-
creased, the insects were neglected while the mar-
riage rate went up. A young man and a young
woman who start the day with following flies,
generally end it by following each other. Thus
the Society, launched in the interests of science,
ended in augmenting the census. When the pro-
moters of the club found that the rarest descrip-
spouse and looked coldly on the fleshly foibles of
youth. Similarly the modest maiden, blushingly
sketching: some primitively-costumed children
dabbling In the pool before her, finds her nearest
class-mate a middle-aged, smug-looking man,
whose appearance suggested that his allegiance
was unequally divided between art and alcohol.
♦ * *
Better, however, than the sketching
“ parties ” is Mr. Watson’s latest idea of what
might be called a “ pictorial charade.” Some
suggestive word, for instance, is hit upon. A few
days afterwards the members met, and, taking
their places at their easels, embody with brush or
pencil their coneeptlons of the particular word
decided upon. For inst mce, suppose the word to
be “ civilisation.’’ One amateur might draw a
bustling street, another a powerful fleet, a third a
crowded senate, while a fourth—a person, say, of
sacerdotal bias—might typify his idea of civilisa-
tion by a Salvation Army or a Sydney School of Arts
meeting just when a committee-man has been
called a “ liar.” All this must be done in presence
of the whole club, no preliminary wora being
allowed, in order that (we quote from a morning
journal) “it shall accustom the artUt to a bold
and speedy execution rather than a laboriously
studied one.” So far as some artists are concerned
we have no dount that the Sydney public would
gladly welcome their “bold and speedy execu-
tion”—perform it, in fact. It was some' days ago
that the first trial of this description of art culti-
vation took place. The motif was the word •* .Re-
pose” kindly suggested by Lady Carington, whom
Mr. Watson has secured as patroness. Some
tearful humourists (teste Mr. Dailey) have affected
to see in it a touch of satire. There’s is no deny-
ing that, as a verb, it might be taken to mean
“ keep quiet” or “ shut up,” but it is almost cer-
tain that, as a common noun, it was placed
upon the market. Be that as it may, the
suggestiveness of the word is apparent. It
offers, too, an immense scope for pictorial
representation. For Instance, what would he
repose to one man would be turmoil to another.
After a day’s hard manual latiour, a person has
been known to court rest by practising a s ide
trombone. A well-aimed brick, handed to him
through the window by an unmusical neighbour,
gave nim and the street the needful repose.
Oddly enough, not only Mr. Watson’s pupils, but
their master himself, gave, in various ways, of
course, treej. water, and women as their ideas of
quiescence—the very three things that have never
made by Mr. Wateon, This we can neither
contradict nor affirm as the artist’s modesty
has kept him reticent, and his silence on
the subject, however to be regretted, is at least
deserving of respect. But at the unfortunately
too rare exhibitions of colonial skill we have seen
some of his works, and do not hesitate to say
that, even in Rome, they would challenge atten-
tion—lf only for their bold defiance of those con-
ventional trammels by means of which common-
place men stupidly endeavour to drag their more
gifted fellows down to their own dull level. In-
deed, It Is not too much to say that the surprise
expressed by good judges at some of Mr. Watson’s
works, was obviously sincere. We have heard
Sydney art critics—people whose natural tastes
had been educated by constant visits to every gal-
leryfrom Parramatta to Dubbo—unselfishly re-
gret that, for his own sake, and for the credit of
the colony, Mr. Watson had chosen Australia In-
stead of Italy for the field of his labours.
* * *
Still, it is not of Mr. Watson as an artist,
but as a teacher, that we would lt Is en-
tirely through him that a new method for com-
bining amusement with instruction bids fair to
be established amongst us. He is the promoter of I
sketching parties. These parties resemble in
some features the meetings of the Melbourne
Field Naturalists’ Club. The members of the
latter, it will be remembered, combine exercise
with entomology by going once a week towards
Brighton, Dandenong, and Wlliiamstown in search
of beetles, butterflies, and other coleopterous or
papilionaceous insects. An elderly gentlemau, of
good anterior development, or a mature maiden
in spectacles, seldom appears to greater ad-
vantage than when pursuing a new description of
tioa of butterfly could sit undisturbed all day on
a fence a few leet from the young scientists, or
crawl over them without fear of capture, they
saw that it was only by people turned 50 that
Australian entomology could be placed in a satis-
factory position. To return to Mr. Watson. The
sketching parties inaugurated by him have already
done good work. O wing to a system of unobtrusive
tact, the dangers to which the Melbourne Oub
succumbed were avoided. Young artists of ardent
temperaments found, on raising their eyes from
their easels, that their nearest neighbour was a
mature lady who, wedded to art, was true to her
been known to be quiet. Mr. Watson, we are told,
dashed off a pretty view of Narrabeen lakes, with
lofty trees in the foreground.” Then there were
a 1 sanded shore,” a “ belt of trees,” a piece of
river scenery,” a “ female at a casement,” and a
girl resting upon a marble terrace.” All the
pieces have been sent to Lady Cariugton lor In-
spection. If a cursory glance at them does not
induce a long and dreamless sleep, it is because her
ladyship’s system defies narcotics.
* ♦ *
But we have it on the Lest authority that
other conceptions, besides those of trees, water,
and females, were embodied by members of the
class. We have seen some of those sketches, and
are somewhat surorised that they have passed
unnoticed by the Press. There was Mr, A.’s work,
for instance. It represented a policeman on a
doorstep at 8 a.m,, and we do not remember to
have seen a more perfect picture of repose. The
empty whisky bottle beside him, and the half-
smoked stumns of cigars around, were singularly
in keeping. Then there was Miss B.’o sketch. Her
idea of perfect rest was a Government office a* o
a- m * Mr. o.'s conception was different Vi
took the Gotany dam with numerous animals
floating on the surface as his subject. But ner.
naps tne idea which of all others conveyed th«
truest understanding of the motif was that of
Master D , Mr. Watson’s favourite pupu it
was simple, too. consisting of a window loaide of
which appeared a row of coffins. On a sign- board
over was;— " UWII

Undertaker.
‘Not dead but gone before.”
We have said enough to show that a promising
future is before Mr. Watson’s pupils. If the
person who invents a new pleasure deserves well
ot his country, how much more deserving of
approbation is he who links that pleasure with
instruenon? We shall conclude by suggesting a
motif for some future occasion. The word Is
ufiifT 1 '??*” is suggestive and readily lends
itself to diversity of treatment. Some of the more
volatile of the pupils, it is true, might, through
sheer mischief and a desire to appear smart, re*
present their teacher, but, even if they do, no one
will more readily join in the laugh than Mr. Wat-
son himself—except the public.
As an example of pre-natal influences in
shaping the habits, we are requested to mention
rtHrinSSoat I ! fa^ that ° early ah the children born
during 188;i in the neighbourhood of the railway
Sydney to Parramatta have developed an
odd taste for whistling. Even some of the wee
ones, unlucky enough to come into the world with
hare-lips—a conformation of mouth which makes
the practice trying to themselves and their
hearers-sit up and whistle when pressed bv
hunger, as well as subsequently when, filled to
overflowing, they desire a vent for their infantile
jocularity. The cause is assigned to the constant
a ® e ,°, f . American whistles by the locomotives on
that line. So strong has the tendency become
that many newly-manied couples have left and
gone towards Botany to give their possible off-
spring a chance of escaping such a doubtful
accomplishment. Prom a psychological stand-
pelnt, the fact we have stated may be instructive,
u S ijl? doubtful whether citizens yet unborn
should have their musical pre-dispositions moulded
after a particular pattern just to show the genius
of Jus American people in the matter of railway
whistles.

The Canadian physicist, Wiggins, tried his
hand on American storms while Astronomer
Hassell, of Sydney, wrestled wi h Australian ones.
Ih • prognostication of both failed- The Canadian
day that was to up-end the Bunker Hill monu-
ment and shift the Mississippi was the calmest one
known for years on the North American eonti ent.
The gale that was to blow a tunnei through Mount
Kosciusko and raise white horses on the Bitany
dam, was lost in the bush near Wagga. A tew
years ago Proctor warned us in the Victorian
Review (Mortimer Franklyn’s powerful organ)
about a “menacing comet" which was to reduce
the earth to a condition analogous to that of an
Irish street after a country fair. Hut the comet,
having an appointment to keep in reducing the
satellites of Orion to chaos, put off its visit to us
for some asons. The lastest scientific discovery
comes to us from Italy, where an astronomer has
found that the planet Mars is peopled by intelli-
g*ent beiogs whose chief occupation appears to
consist in making signs to attract the attention of
the people on earth. Whether they succeed in
80 will depend a good deal on the character
of the signs they make. If they could hit upon
some symbol to show that eleemosynary counter-
lunches and free beer could be had for the asking,
pointing out at the same time the handiest way of
reaching that remote globe, what a number of
openings would be left in the ranks of free-born
Australian citizens!
