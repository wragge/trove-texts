Mr. Leonard Nelson is well-
known throughout the
Commonwealth and New
Zealand gs a dean , versa-
tile comedian and composer
of Australian comic songs.
A Smile and
its Story . . .!
Here you see the smiling countenance of Leonard
Nelson, the “dinkum” Australian comedian. He
is not chuckling at one of his own jokes (good
comedians never do), he is simply demonstrating
the smile of perfect health, and the story relating
to that is told in Mr. Nelson’s own words. He
says:—
“A sick man is never optimistic, and when a
friend recommended me to try CLEMENTS
TONIC, one day, I was rather sceptical regarding
its merits. However, I bought a bottle, and
must acknowledge that the tonic did relieve a
nasty attack of ‘nerves/ Since then I have
taken CLEMENTS TONIC whenever that ‘run-
down’ feeling assails me, and I think it is only
fair to let you know that, in my case, CLEMENTS
TONIC has always proved a beneficial, invigor-
ating remedy.”
Has the hot weather sapped your energy —and
left you like a withered Jeaf ? If so, test the
rejuvenating influence of CLEMENTS TONIC.
It does not contain alcohol or narcotics, but only
medicinal ingredients that calm the nerves,
nourish the system, and enable you to wear the
broad smile of health, well-being, and content-
ment.
CLEMENTS TONIC
is sold throughout Australasia and New Zealand. No reputable chemist
, or storekeeper will try to sell you a substitute.

The Poet’s Faith
Observant travellers have noted that Aus-
tralians do not ask of a man, "Who is he?’’
but, “What is he?” This is well. But Anton
Tchekhov was not content merely to identify
a man with his occupation or profession;
he held that the essential man is to be
found only in the faith of his heart. In
his recently-translated “Note-book'—-it is
loaded on every page with things of pith
and moment —there is this little saying:
“Man is what he believes.” On reading this,
I was immediately reminded of a pronounce-
ment of Macaulay’s: "He who, iu an en-
lightened and literary society, aspires to be
a great poet, must first become a little
child” —a good saying, beneath whose bland
and confident surface there is a snaggy para-
dox or half-truth. For, although it was
clever of Macaulay to assimilate what was
for so many of his contemporaries an indi-
gestible hypothesis, that the poet is a child,
he was perhaps a little ahead of the fact
in assuming that a sleek and enlightened
society really relishes the element of
"wonder” in poetry. It takes a child to
understand a child. But there is no dubiety
about Tchekhov’s aphorism: it is pregnant
with inevitable truth.
To bring the two sayings into alignment
for present purposes, it is neecsary to nar-
row the scope and application of Tchekhov’s
pungent generalisation, and to rewrite it:
"The poet is what he believes.” Here one is
immediately halted, bewildered by the abrupt
divergence of the two paths—that taken by
the poet, and that by the multitude. It is im-
possible not to imagine him as haying at
some time halted there himself, likewise be-
wildered and beset by doubts. He must
love his kind, or he is unworthy the Muse;
lie must forsake his kind, or the Muse will
forsake him. If he “fling roses riotously
with the throng,” he may suffer the loss,
of his soul; yet inhibition imposes penalties
of its own, penalties fatal to experience,
I which is the very tap-root of poetry. And,
• at such a juncture, compromise is equally
fatal. It may, indeed, lead to the generation
1 ;>f a line of best-sellers; but the poet, landed
. in the. ditch of popularity, will never more
, find his true path. He must search his
• heart with questions. “What do I believe?
Am I what I believe ? I see people thriv-
ing in ignorance of Ood, blind to beauty,
narrow, self-wrapt, avaricious. How do
their fleshpots affect me? Will my con-
science withstand the assaulting beguile-
ments. of the world? Must I ‘renounce’ the
world? How shall I go, then, how cheer
myself, how sustain my soul, how discover
faith?”
Song is his only salvation. Nothing in
man’s experience is more divinely positive
than creative ecstasy. Out of his doubts
he will fashion (being a poet) symbols of
certitude. He will be able to say with
bliakspeare, “Not marble, nor the’ gilded
monuments of princes, shall outlive this
powerful rhyme”; with Whitman, “Who
touches this boo-k touches a man”;
with Victor Hugo, “Someone holds you.
It is this book. A book is someone
—-never doubt that.” How far must he
travel, though, before he reaches this emi-
nence ! This is his crown and consummation,
his everlasting reward. He has made a
sword, a bowl, a tower, of his songs. He
lias made a thing of beauty to be a joy for
ever. But what pain, what cloud-in-heart
was his faith not burdened with through
the devouring years—his little time going
and the shadow drawing ever near! The
cloud (it is in every poet’s heart) might
have blotted him in utter darkness; for an
inarticulate poet is akin to a madman. But
as the songs came, : the Songs that were the
fruit of enduring, faith, his poet-pride was
touched and softened and his intuition
deepened into knowledge. It had become a
cloud of light. He was able at last to look
into the unendurable eyes of God.
I am what I believe; therefore I am a
child. This is the focal centre of the poet’s
vision. In the 'vast subconscious (that
hinterland of which we have as yet had
fleeting air-views ,Qnly) it is the child that
abides and is pre-eminent. . To Iris judgment
all the shows and values of life arc com-
mitted. Amoral and serene, he pulls our
little truths up by their roots, pokes inno-
cent fingers through our veils of reticence,
asks shocking questions of us. The will of
no man is strong enough to expunge the
chiM in him. Napoleon—even Napoleon—
said : “1 wish I had talked more with my
mother; she would have taught me much
that I did not know.” And if Napoleon, that
anti-poet, knew the yearnings of a child,
what omnipotent innocence, must rule the
hearty of a Wordsworth, a 'Shelley, a Yeats.
Yet "poets are the acknowledged legislators -
of the world,” and the judges of mankind.
Nioner or later arises one whose divine and
tranquil innocence enables him to judge a
Bear, a Francesba, a Beatrice Cenci, a
Pompilia. Sooner or later, the “super-
fluous kings” must wait upon the verdict of
one whose all-sufficient crown is song.
He nothing common did or mean
Upon that memorable scene.
Marvell’s tribute to Charles’s deportment on
the scaffold may outlive the history of the
king, by thousands of years.
It has been suggested that science, the
cult of the fact, may cramp and kill the
wonder-faculty in man and silence the
potential singers of to-morrow. Never be-
’tw ' is , tlle vilest haphazard thing
that could be said. When the poetic impulse
fa^s iuto desuetude, men

tauities, and their best expression is” song.
*■ ashion remodels the world every century
or so, and once in a while even the per-
manence of our literary forms is. threatened
Something of the sort is happening to-day:
the singers of our “budding morrow” will
hare a new song! and another subject perhaps ;
nut. that they trill have a song is certain as
sunrise. Man cannot sing forever of gay-
panoplied jousts and tourneys and a rain of
bright glances: the age of chivalry is dead,
as Burke surmised. But he can and must
siug the exquisite ardors of his soul. What
matters the subject, if the poet approach
it as a child? Chaucer and Villon could dis-
pense with civet-perfume: they loved the
rank smell of life. So does Masefield:
Others may sing of the wine and the wealth and the
mirth,
Mine be the dirt and the dross, the dust and the
scum of the earth!
And so did young Rupert Brooke: “It’s not
only sunlight and beautiful things. In a
flicker of sunlight on a blank wall, or a
reach of muddy pavement, or smoke from
an engine at night, there’s a sudden signifi-
cance and importance and inspiration that
makes the breath stop with a gulp of cer-
tainty ail'd happiness.” ' Surely, if blank
walls and greasy pavements and engine-
smoke contribute to a poet’s inspiration,
nothing that science can devise will harm
his faith.
ADRIAN LAWLOR
The Elusive Shakspeare
The controversy over the authorship of
the Sliakspearean plays is not yet at an end,
and George Hookham makes the latest con-
tribution in Will o’ the Wisp , or The Elusive
tShaUspcaee (Basil Blackwell, Oxford). He
does not scout the Stratfordian theory and
does not accept the Baconian or any other;
but he does show how unfairly Sir Sidney
Lee and others have played the game.
Of the facts of the life of William Shag-
spere, or Shaxper, of- Stratford, Hook-
ham says there is only material to
till a single page. All the rest is conjecture,
elaboration of doubtful hints, picturesque
imagining and working up of tradition
which cannot be traced to any point of
time within a century of the dramatist’s
death. Yet Sir Sidney Lee builds a biog-
raphy of 700 pages on the slender material,
and does not let his readers into the secret
that almost the entire story is ingenious
fiction. There is, however, no suggestion of
conscious fraud on the part of Lee or any
other upholder of the Stratford theory. The
trouble arises from the fact that Stratford-
ianisin has become a religion and its devotees
are no longer capable of seeing its probable
errors. So the blind lead the blind.
Perhaps Hookham’s most valuable note is
that on the name “Shakespeare.” ’ Summed
up, it amounts to this. In the records of
Stratford Court the name of the supposed
author of the plays is spelt in half-a-dozen
different ways, but all of them ways which
suggest that the first syllable contained a
short, not a long, vowel. In the marriage
bond the name is Slmgspere; according to
Abraham Furley it is Shaxper ; according to
Richard Quiney it is Shackspere. But in
the dedication of “Venus and Adonis” the
name appears for the first time as Shake-
speare, suggesting an entirely different pro-
nunciation. But this is not all, for on the
title pages of the plays it is made evident
that there is a distinct intentioTi that
it should have the modern pronunciation
and no other. A hyphen is introduced, so
that the name appears as Sliake-speare, and in
that unusual form it remains even in the
verses by Leonard Digges prefixed to the
First Folio and also in the commemorative
lines by Hookham has been unable
to find another instance of such a hyphenated
name in the period; and so his inference
would seem to t be justified that, whether the
plays were written by William Shaxper of
Stratford or by somebody else, the name
Sliake-speare is a nom de plume. If that
can be accepted we are some distance on
the journey, for a strong Stratfordian point
is gone. That point was that the man from
Stratford claimed to have written the plays
by signing them with his name. And, if
Hookham has proved his point, Shake-speare
is not his name.
That a provincial usurer who had some
connection with the theatre of the time and
a name resembling that printed on the title
pages of the plays should have possessed
the genius which these pi avs revea l was
always difficult to believe. With the diffi-
culty of belief continually increased by more
and more careful study of the chronology, the
conditions of the times and contemporary
opinion, it becomes almost . incredible.

For the A.J.A.
After reading Frank Morton’s lament (B.
l/2/’23) for the grand old bad old days of
journalism in Sydney before, the Azrael J.
A. fluttered in, I recall with relish that story
of the man who, being asked whether he
thought. Punch was as good as it used to
be, replied: “No —and it never was.” Thirty
years ago, "when Morton and T were on the
same Sydney daily, the staff was sweated,
except the leader-writers, who were petted.
What is now called the spread of work
that is, the time from beginning in the morn-
ing till knocking off at night—was then from
Monday morning till Monday morning. A man
might be and often was in Parliament until
2 or 3 a.m., and due at a court at 10 the
same a.m., thence to plug along until he
went on in the gallery again at 4.30 p.m.
for another all-night stunt. This witness,
after a hard week’s slogging, has on Satur-
day done a football match or boatrace in
the afternoon and attended a theatre first-
night after bolting his tea ; on Sunday writ-
ten his notice in the morning and gone on
all night—6.3o p.m. till 2 or 3 a.m.—to
“assist sub-ed.” ; on Monday assisted sub-ed.
again, and perhaps had some engagements in
the daytime; on Tuesday taken his chance
of having to start at 10 a.m., and so into
the demnition grind again. Annual holi-
days were short, and given at pleasure; one
year the staff had (hem stopped. The pay
was fair, but precarious; the employers
docked ns 10 per cent, in one period of coin-
meroial drought, throughout which, how-
ever, the paper paid handsomely.
Certainly there were many good journalists
on the reporting staffs then—wasn’t I one
of them. Cod wot? But there are at least
as good on the papers now. That a Jot of
what Morton calls tosh is published is most
true. That is due on some papers to rot-

HORSHAM, VICTORIA,
Testifies to the
Magnificent Reliability of WOOD PIPE.
A letter dated -Jan. 9, 1923, refers to 12 miles of 12in. Wood Pipe installed
in 1909 by the Horsham Water Works Trust. Recent installations necessi-
tated an extension, during the laying of which a length of the old pipe had
to be removed. It is in regard to the excellent preservation of this pipe
that Mr. A. Dean, Engineer to the Trust, writes as follows:—-
“Re the 12in. pipe cut out of Urquhart Street. It may interest
you to know that the piece of pipe which had to be cut out to allow'
for fittings for the new' 12in. extension is as good as the day it was
put in, which, I understand, was 14 years ago.”
SIX UNANSWERABLE REASONS
for using
PIONEER WOOD PIPE
in the new
SYDNEY WATER SUPPLY.
1. It is cheaper than cast iron, wrought iron or steel pipe.
2. It is preserved by water and is not rusted or corroded by it.
3. It is not corroded by sulphur, salt or mineral water and fumes.
4. It is not destroyed by acids or salts.
5. Its carrying capacity is from 15 per cent, to 25 per cent, greater
than cast-iron pipe, and remains constant while metal pipe
decreases with age.
6. It does not taint or affect fluids passing through it.

£lOO,OOO more.
£lOO,OOO SAVED!
The Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board already has nearly
150 miles of wood pipe in perfectly satisfactory and economical
use. More than 100 towns in Victoria are copiously supplied
through it; the Tasmanian £3,000,000 Hydro Electric Scheme,
which has just been completed and has a 63,000-h.p. capacity
supplying light and power to the island, depends vitally for its
success on this magnificently reliable water conduit. Many thousands
of other pipes are in use in the Commonwealth.
Why spend £lOO,OOO more and risk another water shortage next
summer?
PIONEER WOOD PIPE is a PROVEN CONDUIT
highly recommended by progressive engineers the world over.
Many of the great cities of America are supplied through it.
W. M. McCabe, M.1.C.E., E.1.C., in making a special report for the
Launceston City Council, said: “Taking everything into consider-
ation, I am of the opinion that Wood Pipes are the best pipes
available. They are comparatively light to handle, and when laid
are elastic enough to stand any earth movement. They improve
somewhat on their first performance, and when the continuous
stave form of pipe, built in situ, is adopted there are no joints—a
big advantage, as any form of joint in any pipe is a weak point.
As regards the life of wood pipes, contrary to the popular opinion,
the wood is practically everlasting, provided the pipe is normally
kept running full, and under these conditions the only part of the
pipe which can be affected by decay or corrosion is the steel
binding on the outside of the pipe. 1 his, however, is much easier
to protect efficiently than is the inside surface of a cast-iron or
steel pipe, and, in my opinion, it is efficiently protected so far as
the wood pipes made in Australia are concerned.”

?f restone
tenly bad subbing, and on a section of the
afternoon issues to the fact that certain
editors and owners and managers are smisa-
tion addicts. Like Byron, they’ll publish,
right or wrong. They believe with Barnum
that the more you fool the public the better
it likes you. But the men are here in
quantity and quality. I am not and never
have been a member of the A.J.A., but I
have handled big staffs both before it and under
its awards, and in my judgment the journal-
istic average is higher over all in Sydney
now than it has been any time within 30-odd
years, in literary knowledge and skill as in
other things. There are fewer incapables,
more men who can be relied upon to do
important work well and to rush it, and a
larger proportion of real first-classers. When
it comes to literary quality and knowledge,
let us remember, if more in sorrow than in
anger, that it was about 30 years ago that
a senior journalist wrote of “that superb
cantata, ‘The Starboard Martyr,’ ” and that
the S. M. Herald reported Parkes as quot-
ing this:
Let us then be up and doing
With a heart for anything;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to win.
This is not to say that there is another
Peters on any Sydney paper any more than
there is another Halley’s comet in the sky,
or another Morton. But is it necessary to
say that a man of Morton’s gifts has no
business in the workroom of a daily paper?
He is essentially and enviably a literary
gent; and as Smalley, the great American
journalist, wisely weighs them out, literature
is an art and journalism a craft. Put this
also to the credit of the A.J.A., that in addi-
tion to stopping the treadmill conditions of
30 and even 10 or 15 years ago it has
wiped out the jealousy and aloofness that
formerly rankled staffs, and replaced them
with a comradeship which makes very power-
fully for smooth running all round.
As to pay for original work, here’s an
instance, now, f’rinstance. Frank Morton
once wrote for his paper an article—should
I not say a prose poem ? —on the post-office
clock-tower and chimes, the Poe-like imagi-
nativeness and exquisite literary grace of
which caused at least one of his colleagues to
ask himself bitterly what the Devil he was
doing crawling between Heaven and earth
and pretending to be a newspaper writer.
Did Morton get any special pay or other
consideration for that little masterpiece? Of
course, he did not. Almost for sure, after
turning it into the sub. he had to do a
par about a missionary address that night,
and was due at “Bankruptcy and District,”
or a deputation, or a mothers’ meeting first
thing next morning. The late Charlie Marter,
of the Svdney D.T., wrote brilliant article
after brilliant article on sport for his paper
—wrote them in his own time and never was
paid or thought of being paid a stiver for
them. The D.T. was once making a splurge
with a (centenary, I think) supplement.
Each of us had to write articles for this out-
break ; and when one leader-writer rightly
demanded time off in which to do his tally
he was reproached because, unlike his fool
colleagues, he didn’t do it pari passu with
his other work, as the editor said. To-day
any member of a staff who hands in an
acceptable article is well paid for it. The
A.J.A. says so. That is one of very many
things the A..T.A. has done to make daily
journalistic life bearable and to encourage
journalists and journalism. Me for the

Who Won the War?
General French was unfortunate in the
book he wrote about his brief and retreating
career as British Commander-in-Chief in
France; in fact, some people went so far
as to say that, in his misguided publication,
he wrecked his reputation as a general, a
soldier and a gentleman. Douglas Haig,
who came after French, isn’t much more
lucky in the book which two worshipping
friends have written about him (Sir Douglas
Haig’s Command, by George A. B. Dewar,
assisted by Lieut.-Col. J. H. Boraston, C.B.
—Constable and Co.). By no means short
of slaying the twain with his own hands,
and perhaps not even by that robust device,
is he likely to clear away the suspicion that
the work is really his, directly inspired, if
not personally written. The object of it is
to transfer from Foch to Haig the entire
credit of the sudden and wondrous change
which came over the scene when Foch be-
came generalissimo and Haig was reduced
from being the holder of a great independent
command to the station of Foch’s subordi-
nate. At this task the two authors labor
most assiduously, carrying water uphill in
sieves in large quantities.
There are difficulties in the way, of course.
Haig’s command lasted from December 15,
1915, to the end of the fighting, four years
later. With the sea covering his flank, and
available as a way of retreat, he was better
placed than other generals. By the date
of his appointment the preliminary shortage
of men was over. During a great part of
his time, and that of Nivelle and P'etain in
the French command, the solid advantage
of numbers was with the Allies on the West-
ern Front, and still, perhaps because the
supreme genius hadn’t yet had his chance,
the outlook remained blue. When the Huns
brought over the troops set free by the Rus-
sian withdrawal, and the Allies lost the
numerical superiority which had done them
so little good, the outlook turned black. Pre-
sently the line—Haig’s line, not Petain’s—
broke. People of a melancholy turn of mind
began to remark that, according to the rules
of the game, the Hun had won and the jig
was up. It was at this blank, bleak moment
that the Allies reduced both Plaig and Petain
to secondary positions, and gave Foch, who
had never been even Commander-in-Chief
over the French forces, supreme authority.
The new man, fighting against odds, plugged
the gap in the line with promptitude, and
proceeded to do things with such a sure hand
that inside three months the offensive had
passed to the Allies for keeps. The trap
into which the Hun, not realising that things
were changed, walked with a light heart
and a martial stride was what looked like
the offer of a feasible road to Paris. The
road proved to be the bottom of a sack, out
of which Fritz scrambled with losses in men,
material, the joy of life and the bloom of
his uniform. They were never repaired.
The credit was generally given to Foch
because he was newly in command, because
the trap was laid with a delicate precision
previously quite unusual, and because the
work was done under Foch’s own eye and
on his (not Haig’s) most familiar ground.
The rival theory is that Haig, after being
known for two years and four months rather
as a gallant, stolid and wasteful plugger of
the U.S. General Grant description than as
a strategist of any sort, had developed, about
eight weeks after his reduction to second
place, into a tactician who could control his
masterful superior and play a poker game
with the best military genius of Germany,
and get away with the Hun’s life’s savings.
A common impression is that Haig’s tendency
towards frontal attacks amounted to a dis-
ease. It is even said that while the British
were being heaved, with appalling loss, at
the face of the Passehendaele ridge, a fairly
obvious track lay before them by which it
might have been turned and the position ren-
dered untenable. Wily successes, such as
the Australians won at Villers-Bretonneux,
seem to have been thought out by subordinate
commanders on their own responsibility.
Headquarters, sitting fiercely entrenched be-
hind its bulldog jaw, didn’t specialise in
tactics. The British Empire forces, includ-
ing even the stodgy Tommy variety, did rous-
ing deeds in the latter days of the war,
especially when they forgot the long-estab-
lished impregnability of the Hindenburg line,
and went through it as part of a day’s work.
But all that was after they came under the
command of the Man Who Knew How.

Poetry as Appendicitis
The tendency of poetry to get away from
its vocal origin began when tiie wandering
minstrel went out of business, and the latest
result of that tendency is vers libre. Way-
ward free verse can nowadays be found even
in such steady journals as the London
Spectator. The question that arises is,
whether the “inner ear,” which is supposed
to provide the criterion of the musical
quality in poetry, is destined to become a
vestigial organ like the vermiform appendix
or the third eyelid. That inner ear, after all,
is itself merely a sort of vestigial reminis-
cence of the days when poetry, being actu-
ally uttered, was listened to actually. The
change in poetic practice, which has been
from singing to writing, and from writing to
the multiplicity of printing, has caused vocal
values to recede. Line-lengths, rhythms and
stanzas can hardly be varied except in a con-
scious and obvious way. But when the poet’s
lines reveal little unconscious changes that are
defects according to the test of enunciation,
this is a true sign that the vocally-founded
convention which he is following is at vari-
ance with what his art has become—that is,
something written instead of something
uttered.
With an exception or two (such as Tenny-
son) to prove the rule, the lines of modern,
and particularly of contemporary, poets
abound in ugly assonances, consonantal jerks
and splutters, the yawning hiatus, juxtaposi-
tions of fipal and initial sibilants, and similar
defects such as are real impediments to
pleasing utterance. Unless pointed out, they
do not seem to be faults either to the poet
who unwittingly writes them or to the
reader who grazes silently on the poet’s
printed page. Shakspeare’s ridiculous asso-
nance “eye I eyed,” occurring in one of the
sonnets, would scarcely have escaped altera-
tion had it been subjected to declamation in
one of the plays, the lines of which flow so
smoothly; for, even allowing that Shaks-
peare wrote it in a mood of wilful jest, it is
not ordinarily intelligible when uttered. As
an example of ugly sound in poetry it is
rivalled perhaps only by a line of is. mard
O’Dowd’s that opens with the words
“To a lewd delirium.” Yet Mr. O’Dowd
has a complete knowledge of poetic crafts-
manship, and gives the greatest care to his
lines. Robert Bridges, also a master of his
medium, is capable of a string of mean
sounds such as “making unevenness even.”
Excellent poets do this sort of thing every
day now without giving it a thought and
without reproof from careful critics. Per-
haps such things cannot now be regarded as
faults. If so. the vocal test no longer counts
—and what becomes of the conventions of
form, rhythm and rhyme which are based
upon it?
Very little significance can be attached to
the few attempts that are made to revive the
practice of declaiming poetry. The tradition
has been broken beyond mending. Paris
seems to be the only place where a liking for
the declamation of poetry has been kept up
with anything like continuity, by Con-
servatoire training, as well as by the inter-
est of a public which likes to hear poetry,
and which is large enough to make such
readings worth while. Poetry matinees are
given to large audiences at the Comedie
Frangaise, besides similar recitals else-
where ; and a “manifestation” in honor of a
poet usually takes the form of recitals of his
works in his presence. In other countries a
demonstration in honor of a poet generally
takes the form of his funeral. The Poetry
Bookshop readings in London, with poets
rendering their own verses, has more of the
suggestion of a circus-tent or of working ex-
hibits at an agricultural show. They differ
from former attempts of the kind chiefly by
the admission charge of threepence, for we
read of Goldsmith going to hear an ode “read
by its author in a publick room at the rate
of five shillings each for admission.” But
such performances cannot now have more
than a sectional and even exotic interest,
being in no sense comparable to the ancient
vogue of the bard, and they therefore can-
not be expected to arrest the change in the
standards which the vogue of the bard began.
Some day, possibly, the poet will be so
dependent upon printing, that he will need
to be an expert linotype operator, expressing
the fine rolling frenzy of his eyes by the
aid of a machine with an infinite range of
type faces, and will be no more capable of
self-expression without it than a pianist
without a piano. At any rate, the import-
ance of the printed setting of poetry has un-
doubtedly increased. An Australian critic
of acknowledged standing, in correspondence
regarding a recent book of verse, used the
words, “Close and subtle work should have
more space between the printed lines, for
easier reading: just as I think loose work is
often improved by tight printing.” There is
something, too, in Dr. Johnson’s quotation
of “an ingenious critiek.” who said of blank
verse that it seems to be verse only to the
eye—though, by the way, Johnson himself,
like most other people, could not get the full
value of a poem by hearing it read aloud,
but required to read it with his own eyes.
It is so with vers libre, which is essentially
a printed thing. Most of it is yet madness.
All of it, to the ear, lacks anything that
would distinguish it from prose. But there
are achievements. Whitman was a bull in
the poetic crockery shon, but his mental
muscularity made an enduring monument of
the pieces. Ezra Pound knows what he is
doing—knows it almost too well. Then there
are Verhaeren and Jean de Bosschere. The
border between prose and poetry has never
been one of exact definition. The contem-
porary repudiation of poetic archaisms, and
the alliance of poetry with ordinary facts —
both healthy signs—have nevertheless
blurred the line of demarcation still more.
Stephen Leacock, in a serious moment,
remarks that “the classics are only
primitive literature. They belong to the
same class as primitive machinery and
primitive medicine.” Perhaps all poetry be-
longs to this class, and is therefore being
gradually eliminated by prose. There is no
telling what civilisation will do for us yet.
FREDERICK T. MCARTNEY.
The Origin of Language
One of the theories about the origin of
language—Professor Epstein, whose book
had a R.P. review some months ago, seems
to favor it —is that in the beginning some-
body came up to, say, a gum-tree, and made
a noise like “gum-tree,” and thereafter
people called the vegetable by that name.
If there is anything in the theory, I don’t
envy the job of the man who had to put
the sounds into writing. Some months ago
I lay for a couple of weeks in a room at the
corner of two busy London streets, where
there was not one of the big city’s incom-
parable policemen to regulate the traffic. All
day, and for most of the night, two streams
—if it wasn’t four streams —of motor
vehicles threatened one another with destruc-
tion at this point, and called out about it
in many tones. Now, everybody knows that
a motor-car honks. Yet, amid a thousand
noises, minatory, admonitory and advisory,
made angrily, impatiently, peremptorily or
diffidently, I was never able to make out
“honk.” .Repeatedly a noise baffled me: I
could not put it into letters. Finally I called
two friends to my assistance—both of them
people with good ears. The results were
surprising, or, rather, would have been sur-
prising if I hadn’t developed so many doubts
myself. A list was compiled of my own idea
of the spelling of certain “honks” and that
of one or other of my collaborators. It ran
like this -
My Own Idea. The Other Fellow’s.
Ek Eng
Erk Poop
Erng Mur
Pup Purp
Erp Urv
Wawp Honp
Burp Bull
Purp Urmnp
Pter Eppur
Perhaps if the same call had been repeated
again and again we might have resolved our
own doubts and come to an agreement about
the proper spelling - of it; but on a single
hearing that was the best that could be
done. The foregoing is merely a fragment
of the list, though to my ear by far the com-
monest noises were in the ek-erk-erng group.
I tried it afterwards by myself in Taris;
but there were so many freak noises, a lot
of them queer little squeaks, that I gave up
that job as hopeless. Hereafter, when I
hear of my bush friends spelling native names,
caught from the mouth of Black Brother,
in nine-and-forty ways, I shall understand.

A Satchel of Books
The Ballad of St. Barbara and other Verses, by
G. K. Chesterton (Cecil Palmer). This is the
real G.K.C. In his recent prose pilgrimage to the
epigrammatic via Ireland, Jerusalem and the Church,
he has tended to become dreary; but here is a
volume by the boisterous author of “The Ballad of the
White Horse.” The title poem is about the patron
saint of those in danger of sudden death : it is one
of the most remarkable written about the war. The
shorter pieces work a cheerier vein. The playboy
of the Catholic world sings of the London Embank-
ment in stormy weather, of the hunting of the
Dragon, and of the four guilds, a union comprising
glass-stainers, bridge-builders, stone-masons and bell-
ringers. But the book contains no drinking-song,
which will be a great disappointment to Hilaire
Belloc. Towards the end of the volume six songs
of education are included, and these are commended
to those teachers —for whom alone there is hope—
who believe that two and two may make five. And
what could be more maliciously compact than these
verses:—
But they that fought for England,
Following a fallen star,
Alas, alas for England,
They have their graves afar 1
And they that rule in England,
In stately conclave met,
Alas, alas for England,
They have no graves as yet.
More Authors and /, by C. Lewis Hind (John
Lane). Another collection of 50 articles on writers
ranging alphabetically from George Ade to Israel
Zangwill, reprinted from the Christian Science
Monitor. Hind had met and knew most of his
subjects, and he entertainingly mixes personal
descriptions and comment with shrewd estimates of
his authors’ work. He is a journalist of wide experi-
ence, and these gossipy articles are of that rare good
journalism which justifies its re-appearance between
the covers of a book.
The Story of Mankind, by Hendrik van , Loon
(Harrap). An admirable volume that will enable
the young mind to take a running jump at the
history of the human race. The author tells the
tremendous story in a series of short chapters couched
in language that not only reaches the understanding
but grips the interest of youth. (Here •■and there
you come across such breezy remarks as “Eventually
the Romans swallowed Greek civilisation hook, line
and sinker.”) Starting with prehistoric man he
vividly pictures the coming of civilisation, and
then the influences, discoveries and personalities that
worked towards the polyglot thing we call “man-
kind” to-day. Though the hefty volume runs to
nearly 500 pages there are, of course, a number of
gaps in the story; but the main essentials are
there, and it’s a big job well done. It will give
a youth a far wider and better grip on the real
bases of history than he could acquire in the
schools, in the piecemeal fashion the subject is
taught nowadays, and his knowledge will be largely
free from that bias which so often obtrudes In
modern history, for the author has brought a broad
mind to his task. On Alice’s principle that no
book is any good without pictures, Van Loon has
supplied pictures galore. Some of them are weirdly
wonderful, but they focus interest; and they are
backed up by a series of “animated maps” that at
a glance tell things which would otherwise take
pages of letterpress to explain.

Perhaps the best and truest thing that has ever been said
about Dodge Brothers’ Motor Car is that you seldom hear
anything but good things said about it.
After all, it isn’t only what a Car is made of that counts.
Performance takes cares of that, but who makes it is a point
that means something to the buyer.
Dodge Brothers have chosen to build into their Car those
qualities which have made it practically immune from the
need of service, except such service as may be caused by
normal wear after long use.

run the chance of being eaten?”
“Whatever you do in this world, my dear,
you have to take your chance.”
Anyway, mine’s not going to be in the
Cannibal Islands.”
By the way, Millicent, what are you
wearing for the dance on Tuesday?”
"I’m not going to the dance.”
“Not going! Why?”
I overheard that horrid Talbot girl say
to Bessie Myers that my skin was blotchy,
and my hair like rats’ tails.
“How very rude of her.”
“Rude! I call it beastly. Anyway, I
have a grain of comfort. Jack Summers
says that I have lovely violet-blue eyes.”
“Of course you have.”
Instead of going to the dance Millicent
had Jones drive her to the home of Mrs.
Douglas a friend of whom she was very
fond.
‘I m delighted to see J r ou, dear,” was Mrs.
Douglas’s greeting; “but I understood you
to say that you were going to a dance to-
night.”
I was, but —-er —well, I’m tired of being
a wallflower.”
“I’m sorry, dear. Did you enjoy that
book I lent you?”
I did, indeed; especially where Trine
says that you can usually be what you make
up your mind to be. Now, I want to be
beautiful. Do you think if I desire beauty
long enough, and earnestly enough, it will
ever come to me?”
“It will, dear, if, as well as desiring, you
take practical means of assisting nature.”
“I would love to. I wonder if you would
be kind enough to advise me?”
“In the first place you need a good cream
that will nourish, and at the same time
remove the discoloration from your skin.”
“I did use a cream, and that horrid hair
you see on my face is the result.”
“So many creams do grow hair on the
face; but have you ever tried mercolized
wax ?”
“No; I’ve heard of it. I thought, how-
ever, that it, too, might favor the growth
of hairs.”
“Not, at all, dear. I’ve used it for quite
a long time. You’ve heard of Frenchwomen
going into retirement during Lent, and hav-
ing the skin of their faces and necks re-
moved by a painful process.”
“Yes; I’ve read about it.”
“Well, mercolized wax has the same effect
without causing any pain or inconvenience.
At night, before retiring, you simply wash
your face in warm water, using a good
soap—I always use Pilenta Soap—then
apply the wax to your face and neck.
Wash it off in the morning, and before
powdering rub in a little of the mercolized
wax, which is obtainable from most good
chemists. Instead of ordinary powder I
always use cleminite, which gives that soft
velvety bloom to the complexion.
“For those blackheads on your nose and
chin, stymol tablets are the best cure. Drop
a tablet in a tumbler of hot water, and when
the fizzing has subsided bathe the face with
the liquid. After drying you will find that
the blackheads have come out on the towel.
“For the hairs on your face there’s
nothing better than powdered pheminol,
which removes the hairs without disfiguring
the skin.”
“How very fortunate I met you, Mrs.
Douglas.”
“Now, for your hair. The first thing to
be done is to shampoo it with stallax!”
“Yes, I’ve written that down. But I don’t
suppose you know of anything that will
keep my hair in curl?”
“Yes, I do —something, in fact, that will
make it curl.”
“How marvellous !”
“It’s a perfectly simple preparation, called
silmerine, which you can get at the chemist’s
and you apply on retiring at night. Brush
your hair out in the morning, when it will
be beautifully wavy, and any short pieces
curly.”
“Oh, how lovely that will be! You can’t
think what a load you’ve taken off my mind.
Now if you would only prescribe something
for my red hands. I’m so ashamed of them.”
“I can, dear, give you a prescription that
I’ve tried myself with the best results. Add
bicrolium jelly to your list of wants from
the chemist. This pleasant, non-greasy sub-
stance quickly blanches the hands, removes
tan, clears out the dirt which soap cannot
reach, and makes the skin soft, white and
smooth.”
“How clever of you, Mrs. Douglas, to
know all these things.”
“I’ve just found them out by degrees.”
“Oh, there’s Jones for me. Good-night,
Mrs. Douglas; I don’t know how to thank
you.”
“Don’t, dear; but consistently use what
I have told you. When you have improved
your skin and hair you will be quite beauti-
ful, and should make many conquests with
those pretty violet-blue eyes.”

Magic Cups.
There is a magic cup of simple white
That shows no pattern till the yellow wine
Glows in its heart; then, rich and fairy-
fine,
Gives all its hidden graces to the light.
Lustres a chaste, pale glaze had kept from
sight
Against a sudden orange sunset shine,
As in a witch’s crystal eyes divine
Their clear imaginings of yesternight.
There is a magic company of men
And gracious women walking all brown
ways.
About their quiet steps no flame-robe streams,
No laurel marks them for the people’s
praise;
Yet when their hearts are filled with wine
of dreams
A glory lingers in the singing pen.

The Stealing Shepherdess.
When I am dead, if any knave should ask,
Out of mere curiosity, of me.
Say that I was a slave to Poetry,
And pilfered bravely here with modern mask
From singing giants, who were wont to bask
In her warm sunshine, wise and frankly
free.
Tell how I sat and listened at each knee,
And copied them as part of my mind's task.
So did my senses suck some honey sipped
By them from flowers that in lost phrases
blow.
Say this, and, prithee, add, for
laughter’s due,
When my poor soul through troubled
stanzas tripped
And haply echoed rhymes of long ago,
Some clever critics actually knew.

A Cynic in His Garden.
I have not kept my soul with fine austere
control;
A blotted page indeed for gods and men to
read;
Yet in my garden I can drop awmy
The senseless follies of a graceless day,
Healed of life’s hurts, forgiven,
By priestly lilies shriven.
There the flowers bloom as free for me—
for me ! —•
As for some white-souled saint.
Touched by no sordid taint,
The heartsease brings its balm ;
The fern fronds chant a psalm ;
No sweet the rose withholds,
Gracious each bud unfolds;
A jonquil lifts its cup
Of fragrant incense up ;
Each spotless snowy flower
Brings me a sacred dower
Of holiness and grace,
As if that perfumed place
Were swept by angel wings
That woke sweet w'hispers of diviner things.
So in my garden I a saint can be,
Clothed with the freesias’ sweet, the lilies’
chastity.

EMILY BULCOCK.
An Inland Garden.
The rain leaps from out of the heavens with
a song of new life on her lips,
And the pulse of the sea beats and murmurs
in the sap of the freshened leaf-tips;
For the rain, like a Venus new-risen, and
the child of the mothering sea,
Strives to bring in the cool of her fingers all
the croon of its billows to me.
Strange that here in my garden afar off, in
a land caught up close to the sun.
Where the sound of the sea never lingers nor
the feet of her waves ever run,
Have my roses grown red with her kisses, my
larkspurs blown blue with her tears,
And the strength of her pain and her passion
poured scent down the freesia spears!
For the flowers about me are calling with
fragrant soft lips through the rain :
“We are born of the sea and her magic,
despite the long leagues of the plain.
You shall feel all her waves in our fragrance,
you shall soothe your sea-heart in our
hues.
In the laughter and life of the showers poured
forth from the sea’s azure cruse.”
O mother of life and of beauty, they never
shall hide me from you,
For your breezes shall find me and fan me,
and your rains drench my soul in your
hue,
And your scent and your color and music,
while the power of your blossoming
hands
Shall reach even here to my garden in the
grip of the smileless plainlands.

The Call in the Dark.
As I went up the hill in the dark
Something called to me;
I know not if it was bird or beast,
Or the whispering of a tree,
Or the long-drawn sigh that comes at night
From the tempest-harried sea.
Something called me, I knew not what;
The way was strange to me.
But whether ’twas voice of bush or bird,
Or the breath of the tired sea,
As I went up the hill in the dark
It gave me company.
As I went over the tree-clad hill.
All earth was kin to me:
Flower and bird by the darkness hid,
And the troubled, patient sea.
Alone, yet never alone walk I,
With these for company.

THE GUMMIDGE FAMILY ABROAD.
“Mr. Justice Harvey is now added to the long list
of aggrieved Australians who have returned from a
visit to Great Britain with lamentable stories of
the contempt of British editors for Australian
news.” —Daily paper.
Mbs Gummidge, created by Dickens, was
a neglected and overlooked female of un-
certain youth and blighted habits. The Aus-
tralian wanderer who returns from England,
and is influential enough to be interviewed
on arrival, resembles her much more often
than is good for him. The tendency to gum-
midge shouldn’t develop into a national
trait. Australia certainly occupies small
space in the British press for its size, and
the traveller from these parts, looking for
home information in his Cockney journal,
sometimes wonders if the land of kangaroos
has blown off the map. Often he concludes
that the British editor is in a conspiracy
against us. So there is a periodical demand
for the establishment of “publicity offices”
in London to supply the local press with
copy to put in its waste-paper basket, till
the publicity men, through long dwelling in
London, lose the run of Australia them-
selves, like the officials of Australia House.
And every now and then some ex-politician
who has a claim to be provided for is sent
abroad at great cost to “advertise his State,”
and is no more heard of till his return—
and possibly not even then. All the time
the widespread ignorance of this country
and its affairs grows deeper, if possible, and
the itinerant Australian continues to gum-
midge.
A plausible explanation is that Australia
is really the Land of Large Borrowings and
Small Beer, and that it furnishes much less
information of an interesting sort than it
should do. The regulation editor at the
Seat of Empire no more wants to ignore
and suppress saleable news than the regula-
tion detective wants to ignore and deprive
of due recognition and limelight the person
who dropped the last body into the Yarra.
Recognition can be secured by doing good
things or bad things, provided they are big
things. Thus for a while Ireland got nearly
all the space that the Unspeakable Turk
didn’t require, and the Turk got all the
space that Ireland could spare, until the
French occupation of the Ruhr began to
crowd them both. Australia has also had
its spells of publicity. A leading English
review gave a dozen or so pages to N. S.
Wales alone in the days when the Ma State
had a Cabinet of nine gentlemen of Irish
descent, 13 outrageous spendthrifts, and 13
persons who had granted themselves huge
increases, of salary. That was when the
Profiteering Bill, in its original form, and
before the Upper House grievously damaged
it, proposed to establish a court which would
have power to overhaul the past doings of
firms and companies, declare their past tak-
ings to be overcharges, and forfeit the same
on a liberal but undefined scale. The court
was not to be bound by the ordinary rules
of evidence, and the draft bill provided 15
new ways of earning five years’ penal servi-
tude. It was also the time of a draft Land
Resumption scheme, by which an enormous
proportion of N. S. Wales was made liable
to seizure at a price fixed by the Govern-
ment’s own. special court, payment to be
made after indefinite delay, and then in de-
preciated long-distance debentures, any
improvements made in the time of waiting
to be confiscated. Queensland received enough
attention from the English press to satisfy
any publicity agent when Preinier Theo-
dore went to London to borrow £9,000,000.
Just previously his Government had enor-
mously increased the rents of its pastoral
tenants, regardless of the terms of their
leases, and, with the same retrospective
habit which afflicted the Storey Govern-
ment of N. S. Wales, had dated the in-
creases back, thus adding to them very heavy
and almost ruinous fines. Theodore didn’t
raise £9,000.000, nor even 9d., of new loan
money, but he got lashings of John Bull’s
journalistic space—even more than is given
to a fashionable hanging. During the war
the pressure on newspaper elbow-room was
intense, but Australia received a share. And
when this country’s banks broke in 1892-93
the area which the British nress 1 to
it was generous, if not lavish. The editors
of the Cold Country show no cruel inclina-
tion to suppress our happenings, provided
they are large enough.
Supposing every newspaper in the British
Isles and the United States which really
counted was supplied by an efficient little
Publicity Bureau with a picture of the Syd-
ney Harbor bridge and the first train pass-
ing over it, quite a number would repro-
duce it, and tens of millions of people would
learn that Australia exists, and that Syd-
ney is a great city with no mere puddle for
a harbor. Photographed from a judicious
angle the bridge might be made H miles
long. Some advertisement might be extracted
from the opening of the S'Uith-to-North rail-
way, the arrival of the first overland flyer
at Darwin (depth of water in Darwin Har-
bor almost, incalculable), and the sailing of
the first liner by the new short route to
Europe, Asia and America. It it was added
that the purely leasehold system had been
abandoned, and that 10,000 farms were for
sale in the Territory, quite a ripple of in-
terest would ensue. Cheap advt, might be
gained by the announcement of the forma-
tion of five fresh States—Carpentaria in
the north, including Darwin; Capricorn to
the south of it and astride the tropic line ;
Torres Land in North Queensland; Glad-
stone (possibly) in Central Queensland;
and Easterland on the N. S. Wales Northern
Rivers, because the most eastern part of
the continent is there. No other country—
not even gigantic Brazil —has the raw mat-
erial for five big and quite habitable new
States on hand, but Australia could do the
deed, and have at least three more big new
States to spare. Desirable immigrants would
think five new countries had been found, and
would rush to settle them, especially after
seeing pictures in the wide world’s press of
the laying of the foundation-stones of five
new capital cities. And these are only a
few of the possibilities. Unfortunately, Aus-
tralia fritters away twice the market price
of big advertisement in niggling, money-
losing jobs which supply patronage but lead
nowhere —a row of shoddy cottages here and
there, sawmills, timber-yards, little fish- and
meat-shops, and the like. If Australia has
drifted away from the habit of supplying
the sort of news that gets attention on the
front page, it is hardly worth while to gum-
midge about the lack of attention. Also it
is hardly a grown man’s job.
THE KINGDOM OF SUICIDE FLAT.
Poland, the flat place without scenery which
committed suicide at the end of the 18th cen-
tury, is coming into fashion again, like a
revived pattern in bathing costumes, though
it can’t be said that it ever quite went out.
In older days it was a land tenanted almost
exclusively by nobles, slaves and Jews, and
when it took on the exile habit, and sup-
plied some 200,000 romantic expatriated
counts to appeal to the flappers of all na-
tions, it acquired a character of its own.
Books about Poland grow common once more
—largely Yankee books, and the Yankee is
often more hysterical than historical. Poland
in these pictures is invariably a country
with a great past and a greater future. Its
people were and are a high-spirited race,
who scorned the idea of hereditary kingship
as practised in effete old Britain, and
proudly elected their monarclis. Poland is
understood to have died a noble and stain-
less death when Russia, Prussia and Austria
divided the country, so that thereafter Bole
was called on to fight against Pole under
an alien flag, and the cup of unprecedented
disaster was full. As a fact, the Serbian
nation was similarly partitioned and for
much longer than Poland. Also, as late as 1860
Austria hanged partitioned Italians for re-
fusing to fight against other Italians, and
as late as 1916 it flogged partitioned
Roumanians for reluctance to shoot at their
mother country. But the mishaps of Poland
always attracted special notice pwing to
Freedom taking a day off to shriek when
Kosciusko fell.
Poland was always a disappointing place.
It was bulky, if not great, before Russia
was consolidated and beiore the Austrian
empire was dreamed of. It had early Hohen-
zollerns for vassals. Rut the habit of being-
left at the post Jet its neighbors get ahead
of it. It exercised remarkably little in-
fluence, considering its gross tonnage, on
European affairs. On world affairs it exer-
cised still less, though it was supposed to
be at the height of its glory when much
smaller Powers were dividing the New
World and the re-discovered Old World
among them. The Polish fleet was always
shy of putting to sea. The population con-
sisted too largely of nobles who were too
much eaten up with pride to keep shop; and
of slaves who were much too ignorant to
do so even if their masters had permitted,
and who were, to a great extent, demoralised
through living in holes in the ground. So
the most wonderful collection of Jews that
was ever seen in a similar space since the
Romans burned the Temple moved into
Poland to look after trade and finance. The
nobles were often too disorderly for effective
fighting. The slaves had nothing much to
fight for. And the alien middle class, instead
of being the backbone of the national de-
fence, didn’t care what happened to' any
Christian, Polish or otherwise. To-day 11
per cent, of the Polish population is Jew,
and, considering the kind it is, that is too
much Jew. The Polish crown was some-
times elective, the Jews and the Polish
masses having no votes; sometimes it was
hereditary; sometimes it was cateh-as-catch-
can. Probably the steadiest period in the
country’s history was when seven princes of
the House of Jagellon reigned in succession.
It was characteristic of the Polish way of
doing things that the first queen of this
Polish line was a Hungarian, and her hus-
band a Lithuanian who, legend has it,
arrived in a heathen state, and in a chariot
by bears.
After the Jagellons were all safely dead
the elective principle was firmly established,
though sometimes the son was chosen after
the father, and the kingdom started on the
downward path. The general idea was to
beguile a foreign sovereign to the throne, so
that his other army and his other revenues
might save Poland a lot of trouble. Natur-
ally his other enemies often came to Poland
after him, and his other quarrels were often
fought out on Polish soil. As a rule the
king bought his crown by giving up part of
the royal power till there was none left. In
the bourse of 220 years Poland thus tied up
temporarily with Transylvania, Sweden and
Sax;ony ; to some extent with Austria, though
the elected Austrian was diddled out of his
throne; and once with France, for Henry
111., the last degenerate of the Valois line,
signed himself as king of both countries.
Poland came to be more familiarly pawed
and handled by strangers than any other
female in Europe. She was always being
inspected with a view to purchase. In the
end the country was so completely shut in
by Russia, Austria and Prussia that it had
to choose one of the three monarchs, or his,
or her, or their nominee. To save trouble
and ill-feeling they took her in common. A
lady who was for sale or lease so regularly
was almost bound to fall into the hands of
a syndicate in the end. During the last
phases of the story the payment of taxes was
voluntary, so most departments of State led
a ragged existence, or none at all. Any
single peer, in a Parliament that looked
more like a camp than a legislature for
size, could suspend or dissolve that august
body, and his single vote could reject any
or every measure. It had come to be un-
derstood that solitary barons or collections
of barons had a right to make war on each
other and on the king, with or without the
aid of foreign Governments. Pandemonium
was on top, and everything else underneath.
* * * *
Poland has been a theoretical international
pet, partly because of the hopelessly belated
fights it put up under the great Kosciusko,
who was made into a poem, and the still
greater Joseph Poniatowski, who wasn’t,
possibly because his name didn’t fit. In ad-
dition it has been advertised by the big
export trade it did in exiled lords and ladies,
it being a place with superfluous peerage
to burn. These, being mostly fine specimens
of the human animal, kept its case well to
the front. Also, it has exported anarchists,
who have meddled in every revolution or at-
tempt at the same, undersized Hebrews, and
unskilled, cheap and ignorant labor. But it
has had no great past. Whether it has any
kind of a future perhaps the Huns and the
Bolsheviks will decide.
ISOLATED.
When William Lane’s lieutenants were
selecting the site of the proposed New
Elysium in Paraguay, one of the questions
they asked the Foreign Minister was “What
about revolutions —how do we stand when
you are having a dust-up?” The Minister
patted them on the back. “Don’t you
worry. There ain’t going to be any more
revolutions. This Government is a strong
one, and is in for keeps. And, anyhow,
even should there be a revolution, if you
people don’t interfere with it it won’t inter-
fere with you.” That was 30 years ago,
and I can count seven, maybe eight, Para-
guayan revolutions since then. Some have
been flashes in the pan, just a little trouble
in Asuncion that we have not heard anv-
thing about till it was all over, as happened
some six months ago. Two friends of the
Coming Man called on the Present Man
and asked him if he didn’t think it time he
cleared out. As it was two in the morn-
ing—a dismal hour to call —and the callers
pointed their arguments with a couple of
revolvers, El Presidente signed his abdica-
tion and got out. That’s all there was to
it. The ins were out, the outs were in,
and the ex-man took his breakfast at the
Palace Hotel, instead of at the Palacio.
And till the mail came along at the week-
end, we of New Australia didn’t know that
we had had a Red Government for five days
instead of the old Blue.
But ’tis not always thus. Although we
try to be strictly neutral, and do as the
Minister advised, going in for a policy of
non-interference, we get it in the neck occa-
sionally all the same. One affair we had
live years ago was about the worst —
nO . mans for lo weeks; telegraph wires cut;
railway bridges burnt; no stores —sugar,
flour, salt, kerosene, matches all done; and
the second generation of New Aussies afraid
to move off the doorstep. As to these
youngsters it is like this. According to the
terms of settlement, the original settlers
were exempt from military service; but
nothing was said about their descendants,
born in Paraguay. Killy Lane seems to
have forgotten them. So now, when there
is a scrimmage on, the old man gets
about outside, whilst the boys sit on the
roof amt watch for trouble. There had
been rumors of revolution a week or tw r o
before the mail stopped, but we didn’t take
much notice—the natives are usually full
of rumors of some sort. The first definite
news we got was that a bloody battle had
been fought in Asuncion, and that now the
Reds and the Blues were scouring the coun-
try-side seeking cannon-fodder for more
bloody battles. One-eyed Pedro, riding
helter-skelter, brought the tidings. lie had
met a man who knerw a fellow that had
seen a detachment of Reds escorting “fod-
der” along the main road. The peons for
miles around ran for coyer like rabbits.
They were not taking any revolution. Peons
who were peacefully wending their way to
the nearest town with lumber dropped their
logs, unyoked the bullocks, and scooted for
the distant forest, falling over themselves in
their rush to get there first. Peons, hold-
ing the weekly round-up on a big estancia,
looked at one another aghast as Pedro rode
by shouting the direful news. Then, as
one man, they decided that revolutions were
off, and spurred for their ranchos, leaving
the majordomo in charge of 500 head Of
wild ’uns. He, being a pious man, offered
up a few short prayers for the departed and
got likewise, and the cattle chased him
home. Old Bill, one of the Pilgrim
Fathers, had a couple of peons helping him
to shift a fence to extend his paddock. They
had got the wires drawn and about half the
posts up, when Pedro came galloping by,
spitting out gibberish at every stride. The
natives straightened up, jumped for their
shirts and machetes, and were off before
Bill realised what the trouble was. Bill
rose in his wrath and cursed “King Billy”
for the millionth time, and then made four
trips to carry the wire home—it doesn’t do
to leave loose wire out o’ nights in Para-
guay, even in revolution time. We Gringos,
secure under the folds of our flag, didn’t
give a hang (so we said) for revolutions.
Nevertheless, we rounded the animals into
the paddock, put the mare into the kitchen
garden, spiked the sliprails, and wired the
gates. Since the trouble of 1912, when
the colony lost about half of its animals,
we are running no risks. Or, at least, as
few as we can.
Another old hand called, round with more
information and the advice to cache our
cash and valuables. Under the fireplace is
good, but old Jake planted his there in
1912, and the hot ashes got through, and
he lost his dollars. So we packed all our
silver plate, tiaras, heirlooms and a wad of
dollars (value now, lid. each) in a kero-
sene-tin and buried it under the dog-kennel.
At sundown we bolted and barred everything
that was boltable and barrable, saw the
revolver was in working order, and put cart-
ridges in the double-barrel. About 8 o’clock,
when we were thinking about turning in and
trying to forget it, the dog started barking.
Under ordinary circumstances we would have
put it down to a stray cow. But now it
was different. I looked at my wife, and she
nodded at our patent pig-fat lamp. I put
it out, reached for the gun and crept into
the kitchen, where I could get a view of the
gate. “Damn good mind to give ’em both
barrels,” I whispered to the wife. But she
objected. “If there are more revolutionaries
around it might bring the whole crowd
along.” The. strain was relieved by: “Be
damned! What have you done to this
gate?” It was only another New Austra-
lian wanting to borrow kerosene—and we
had forgotten the smell of it! Till this day
he doesn’t know how near he was to getting
a double dose of shot, instead of a light for
his pipe.
We had over 10 weeks of that —short of
tucker; no kerosene or matches. We had-
to keep the fire banked all night; if it failed
we had to ride a couple of miles for a fire-
stick. Never a native in sight, bar a girl
now and then to exchange an old hen for
salt—and we had none ourselves. Some-
times in the distance we would see a squad
of Blues chasing a detachment of Reds
who had gone by two days before. They left
us severely alone. But when tucker got
scarce in the montes and the oranges were
all done and no stray pigs were left, the
refugees took to raiding our mandioca
patches at night, and we could see their
camp-fires glimmering in the woods as the
women cooked the plunder, to take to the
patriots in their hiding-places.
Now there are rumors of another revolu-
tion, but I have planted a dozen of matches.
Revolutions are the very devil when a man
can’t light his pipe.
PARAGUAY.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Turning Off the Gas.
The programme, as at present advertised, is
that the Brughes-Page Ministry will meet
Parliament at the end of the month in order
to comply with the law, will do nothing that
can be avoided, and will promptly scuttle
into long recess to decide what it is going
to do afterwards. Excuse is supplied by the
congested state of the departments, where
everything went into arrear during the weeks
that it required to drag Hughes out of the
tart-shop. Still one or two items might be
done so that the Ministry might get its
hand in, and show that it is alive. If they
were good and successful doings the country
would ruminate during the recess on the
blessings of having a Bruce-Page Ministry,
and give it the more support when it really
took up business. For one thing an ordi-
nance, or some such familiar object, might
be sent to the N. Territory, admitting that
the pure leasehold system has been a fail-
ure in attracting settlers who will anchor
on the land, and (experimentally) putting


farms up for sale, with some simple restric-
tions to prevent one man getting too manj
farms. If there was need for thought and
delay the restrictions could be copied from
State Acts and sent along later, but tne
essential is to declare that a new policy has
begun. Should the Territory show signs o
improvement in consequence the Cabinet
might thereby get a hint about what to cio
next. Anyhow, there is no reason why the
place should moulder all the while the gov-
ernment is resting. Some time might be
saved by a short Act giving the Auditor-
General power and directions to overhaul
the accounts of the Commonwealth shipping
department, and publish its balance-sheet
without waiting for Parliamentary authority.
If the result could be got ready at short
notice it should supply interesting reading
for the dull season, and this way of doing
things would convince the public that there
was no more murky mystery. Also it would
supply the Government with facts to go
upon. Then a brief Bill might be introduced
providing for the abolition of as many
bureaus and other frills as the Ministry,
aided by the advice of the Auditor-General,
can possibly spare. Thus some savings
would accumulate during the legislative dead
season, even if the new men lacked the
courage to lay sacrilegious hands, at _ short
notice, on the baby bonus and left it till
later. Next session savings will be badly
wanted unless the Post Office, for one item,
is to perish like a dog by the wayside, lhe
general tenor of complaint is that the ser-
vice costs twice as much as it did a while
ago, and, to balance things, is twice _ as bad.
By heroic but erratic measures it is made
to yield a profit of about £1,200,000 a year,
none, or hardly any, of which goes in new
works, and not enough in support of old
ones, it being required as drink-money for
the new baby’s father, and to pay for new
bureaus, new departments, new officials, and
the other crazy and purposeless extrava-
gances of a succession of Hughes Govern-
ments, with which superfluous expenditure
was the ruling passion. The last inspiration
of that Ministry was to load posterity with
a new debt of £7,000,000 for the repair
of the wonderfully profitable Post-and-
Telegraph machine which had been fooled
into decay. The question for an honest set
of rulers now is how to do without the
£7,000,000 loan, to make the apparatus pay
for its own repairs, and at the same Bine
to make it a much better apparatus. Most
people also demand that it shall be cheaper;
but that is a good deal to ask, considering
the arrears to be attended to. The Bruce-
Page combine isn’t called on to produce a
complete plan of reformation right oft. But
it is called on to plant the seed of economy
right off, and let it be growing. In other
words, it is invited to turn off as much ot
the gas as possible before going to bed.
The Dutch Have Their Doubts.
Thanks to the abundance of murders,
divorces, pony-races, four-day cricket-
matches and controversies about the respec-
tive merits of Rodolph Reid and W allace
Valentino, the swift decay of the Austra-
lian Defence system gets scant notice in the
copious chronicles of the time. But now
and then, when things have been dull in the
Divorce Court, or there were only 16 handi-
caps at Robbery Park instead of 17, or the
discussion as to whether girls should wear
garters or suspenders shows signs of perish-
ing, there is room for a bit of i stuff.
On such occasions items like the following
are apt to stray into the News and Notes .
The Director of Naval Intelligence announces that
the following vessels of the R.A.N. are to be paid
off: the battle-cruiser Australia: the light cruiser
Sydney; the destroyers Swan, Torrens, Parramatta,
Yarraj Warrego, Huon, Swordsman, Success, Tattoo,
and three sloops. Among the non-effective ships 101
disposal are submarines Jl, 2,3, 4, 5 and i .
China and Greece have later and faster aircraft
than the R.A.A.F. With the inferior machines now-
in use the R.A.A.F. would be quickly beaten down by
an enemy it might engage him for an hour or so,
but this would only mean sheer waste of lives and
material. Funds are so low that most of the equip-
ment presented by the Imperial Government has
never been removed from the packing-cases and is
now obsolete.
Of the Australian field force, as was
remarked the other day by an A. 1.1. com-
mander, nothing remains except a skeleton.
When the ruin of the other arms has been
accomplished, Hughes’s Trade Commissioner
at Bangkok (no doubt there is one at Bang-
kok) will have to be instructed to behave
with the humility befitting a country which
has scrapped its preparations for arguing the
point with an invader. There is quite a
brisk flying corps in Siam. There is also an
army of 10 divisions, based on compulsory
service, and the flotilla that hangs round
the Gulf of Siam is by no means to be
despised. The Trade Commissioner at
Batavia or Sourabaya will likewise have to
be warned to cultivate a deferential frame
of mind. Before the Washington Confer-
ence, to which their nation was not a party,
the Dutch were content to protect their
spice islands with a few old coast-defence
ships. But since Japan’s supremacy in the
Western Pacific was ensured by the five-
Power agreement, which limits battleships
and battle-cruisers, but not cruisers, flotilla
leaders, destroyers, submarines or aircraft,
the Amsterdam Government has become
alarmed for the safety of the national meal-
ticket. It therefore proposes" to spend 50
millions on naval and aircraft construction
so as to put its East Indian Empire in a
state of defence. In the first six years two
cruisers, 12 destroyers, 16 submarines and
two minelayers are to be built, along with
72 scouting" aeroplanes, 18 chasers and 18
battleplanes. In the six years following there
are to be two more cruisers, 12 more
destroyers, sieven more minelayers, a sub-
marine parent-ship, several auxiliary vessels
and thousands of mines, together with such
additions to or replacements of the air force
as may be advised. There are also to be
a main naval base at Tandjong Priolc, out-
side Batavia, and two sub-bases, one at
Sourabaya and the other in the Reouw
Archipelago. And the Dutch-Javanese army
will doubtless be strengthened in proportion
to the increase in the flying corps ; at the
latest computation it numbered about 40,000
men, but that was before the conscription of
Europeans for service in the militia and the
landsturm. Beyond a few campaigns against
the natives of his steamy archipelago the
Hollander has done no scrapping for more
than a century. He shaped rather poorly
in the wars of the French Revolution and
Empire; in fact, his record was inferior, if
anything, to that of our gallant allies, the
Pork-and-Beans. All the same, his plans for-
giving the invader of Java and Sumatra _a
crowded time, instead of relying on Britain
or Germany, as formerly, suggest that the
spirit of Silent William and the De Witts
hasn’t vanished from the laud of crazy
windmills and patched pants. The example
is significant as well as inspiriting, for Hans
knows the Asiatic better than we do, and is
not building battleplanes and laying down
submarines for fun. When 50 per cent, of
his programme has been completed he will
possess a sizable striking force distant three
days from Darwin by sea and lialf-a-day by
air route. Australia’s preparations against
invasion will probably then consist of moun-
tains of pacifist literature and a collection of
old junk.
One of the Eternal Questions.
Senator T. W. Craweord, the eleventh man
in the Bruce-Page Ministry, is president of
the Australian Sugar Producers’ Association.
A day or two before he joined the Govern-
ment his association decided to ask for an
addition of £4 13s. 4d. per ton to the import
duty on cane-sugar—a duty which when the
last Parliament was on its deathbed was
raised from £6 to £9 6s. Bd. a ton. Actually
that increase was only birdlime to catch the
unsuspecting Queensland elector; it cannot
operate while the sugar agreement is in
force, and that doesn’t expire till the end of
June. Under the agreement the canegrowers
have drawn £l9 6s. Bd. per ton, and the re-
finers £ll per ton, for three years. The
refiners are evidently resigned to the inevit-
able, but the growers, or many of them, are
hoping for an extension of the agreement,
and that is quite out of the question. An ex-
tension of the agreement involves extension
of Government control, and Australia is not
in the mood to tolerate any more Govern-
ment control, of sugar or any other commo-
dity. It is sick of the very name. For about
half the control period the grower suffered,
owing to the Government ignorantly paying
him an unremunerative price, the result
being that a large acreage went out of culti-
vation. During the other half of the experi-
ment the consumer has been the victim in
consequence of the Government’s imbecile
purchases in Java and Cuba. Neglecting to
buy abroad when the opportunity was favor-
able, it waited till the price had jumped
and placed huge orders on a soaring market,
as a result of which the consumer has had
to pay an extra penny a pound—not in the
grower’s interest, although that person has
been widely blamed, but to meet the stag-
gering losses on the Government’s oversea
transactions. Precious as the sugar indus-
try is to Australia, it is useless to ask for
a "continuance of the system under which
such follies are possible. The country simply
won’t stand it. Neither will it agree to the
alternative proposal of a pool managed by
the omnipresent Government. If the sugar
people want a pool let them run their own,
as the wheatgrowers are doing with encour-
aging results: seeing that a voluntary organ-
isation has shown its capacity to market
30,000,000 bushels of grain in _N. S. Wales
it ought to be comparatively simple to deal
with 200,000 tons of sugar in Queensland.
The State Government suggest a five years’
pool, of the only sort that appeals to the
Theodores and Dooleys, together with pro-
hibition of imports for the same period, sugar
to be retailed at 4|d. per pound. But if im-
ports are interdicted special provision will
have to be made for the fruitgrowers, who
in many parts of the Commonwealth are
having a gruelling time. In the interest of
White Australia the sugar industry must be
preserved, but no scheme will be tolerated
that does not admit of the fruit industry get-
ting sugar at a price that will enable the
grower, the canner and the manufacturer of
jams and jellies to carry on. Provided this
is done the sugar people have an unassailable
right to adequate protection. On the credit
side of their account with Australia, Ltd.,
is the one great and successful attempt to
colonise the tropics, and good Australians are
prepared to make any reasonable sacrifice to
keep them going. There will be no serious
objection if the duty is made three-halfpence
instead of a penny a pound. Nevertheless
the time is inevitably coming when Parlia-
ment will have to be satisfied that the indus-
try, and especially the refining end of it, is
being run in accordance with the best modern
practice.
Garden Blows the Gaff.
Since the second Russian Revolution in
1917 the Sydney Worker has devoted a
considerable portion of its space to spread-
ing the gospel of Bolsh. It has published
miles of Moscow articles in praise of Lenin,
Trotsky, Litvinoff, Zinoviev, Litnarchar-
sky,, Tchitcherin, the Red Army and the
Extraordinary Commission. and leagues of
envenomed attacks, supplied from the same
source, on Lloyd George, Wilson, Clemen-
ceau, “English Imperialism, French mili-
tarism and American capitalism.” Until
comrade Garden, of the Sydney Trades and
Labor Council, went to Russia a few months
ago, the A.W.U. organ led its readers to be-
lieve that every poisonous lucubration issued
by the Bolshevist press-agency was as true
as Holy Writ. But when Garden spoke at
the so-called World’s Congress of the Third
Internationale he gave the show away. It
therefore becomes necessary, for the first
time in five years, to repudiate a slab of
Red propaganda, and to denounce Garden
as “a comical cuss of a Communist,” and a
purveyor of “grotesque falsehoods.” This
because the T. and L.C. secretary made the
following statements, among others: —
The Labor Council of N. S. Wales constitutes 120
unions. Yet the Communist party has full control
of the executive. Out of 12 members of the
executive 11 are members of the Communist party,
and they direct these 120 unions, and the policy of
each union. The Communist party has a member-
ship of under 1000. and yet is able to direct close
on 400,000 workers. As far as the Labor party is
concerned, we found that we could also direct the
policv of the Labor party. The result of our activi-
ties is that in the agricultural department there is
now one union comprising 120,000 workers. In the
mining industry we have linked up all the workers
in and around the mines—miners, engineers, black-
smiths —45,000. In the domain of land transport we
have all the workers of the railwavs, from engine-
drivers to porters, linked up—sß,ooo in all. u e
have 17 building trades in Australia, and they have
agreed to form one organisation, the Building Trades
Industrial Union of Australia. This comprises 42,000
workers All these unions affirm the class struggle,
and maintain that capitalism can only be overthrown
bv revolutionary political and industrial action. The
result of this militant activity has been the linking
up of these forces into one big union which is break-
ing down all craft barriers.
Gravely embarrassed by these disclosures, the
Worker attempts to dismiss them as “fan-
tastic funniosities.” But they are only too
true. It is impossible to deny that the
Trades and Labor Council is run by Com-
munists, or that the Brisbane Congress of
the A.L.P. adopted a Communist objective.
It is an undoubted fact that the All-Austra-
lian Congress of Trades Unions declared
in June, 1921, and again in July, 1922, for
socialisation of industry by unadulterated
Bolshevism —that is to say, “by the workers
uniting in one class-conscious organisation
to take and bold the means of production by
revolutionary industrial and political action.”
It is also a matter of common knowledge
that the A.W.U. shearers, gold : miners
and general laborers are uniting with the
waterside workers and the coal and metal-
miners to form the One Big Union, and
what is the One Big Union but an attempt to
realise the ideals of Moscow by the methods
of Idaho? To that extent Garden told
his Red masters the truth. Where he mis-
led them was in concealing the fact that Bol-
shevism, as far as Australia is concerned, is
tottering to its fall. Union after union has
quitted his Trades and Labor Council.
Humbled and impoverished by its direct-
action adventures, the A.W.U. has reverted
to constitutionalism and arbitration. The
N. S. Wales A.L.P. has declared against the
Communist objective, and at the next annual
conference the socialisation of everything
will doubtless be dropped. In a word, the
Australian toiler is abandoning the pursuit
of wealth and power by Red revolution and
returning to the path of ordered progress.
But the revolt against Russianism is entirely
the work of the rank and file of the workers.
No help has been forthcoming from those
political and trade-union leaders who, in
their moral cowardice, intellectual laziness
or worse, allowed the Australian Labor
movement to be yoked for years to the vilest
system of robbery and murder that ever
nolluted the earth.
The Church Census.
Dear Bulletin, —Nothing has disturbed the
ecclesiastical dovecotes m recent years like the
"religious census” of the people of Aus-
tralia, recently published. Its conclusions
are so unexpected. Eirst, the Church of Eng-
land is the only great church which is not
only keeping up with the natural increase
of the .population, but forging far ahead of
it. This is a new thing, and litis come upon
the Anglican as a pleasant surprise. The
C. of E. in each State has increased far be-
yond others, even in South Australia, where
the Methodist Church, which is there
numerically stronger than anywhere else in
the British Empire, might have been ex-
pected by sheer weight of numbers and social
momentum to have made more progress.
The C. of E. in S.A. totalled 165,968, an
increase of 52,187; Methodists 122,634, an
increase of 22,232. In N. S. Wales the C. of
E. membership is 1,027,301, an increase of
293,301, which is 48.91 per cent of the people
—nearly one half. This is a jump of 3.45
p.c. beyond the rate of increase in the census
of ten years ago. While the C. of E. is
bounding forward the other great churches
are slipping back. The R. C. Church has
482,575 people, or 22.97 p.c., showing a
lapse of 2.57 p.c. The Presbyterian Church,
219,932, or 10.47 p.c., a lapse of .86 p.c. in
the decade. The Methodist Church has
181,977, or 8.66 p.c., showing a smaller
lapse of .71. The R.C. Church, not-
withstanding its incomparable organisa-
tion and discipline, has the largest loss. The
position in N.S.W. seems to be typical of
the Commonwealth. Various reasons are ad-
vanced for the C. of E. rate of progress. Cor-
respondents in the daily press have hastened
to prove that the C. of E. figures are of
nominal members, and that indeed there are
not nearly enough Anglican Churches in
N.S.W. to hold all these people who call
themselves “Church of England”; further-
more, that the Anglican ministry is ever
bewailing the fact of small congregations in
such churches as there are. All of which is
quite true. , The other churches draw a
little Job’s comfort out of this fact also;
but is it wise to deceive themselves? If we
seek the cause of C. of E. progress it is
easily found. The church has developed an
amazing capacity for Minding Its Own Busi-
ness. Its bishops do not fulminate in
printer’s ink. Its leaders do not interfere in
politics or seek political advantages. It is
a church without public grievances. A com-
plainer is a bore. A public institution with
a perpetual grouch loses the power of appeal.
Nobody respects self-pity and the pose of
martyrdom has lost its pull. The churches
are too prone to “swear at large” in confer-
ences and assemblies; consequently they lack
the power of attack when they should have
it. Possessing so vast an army of adherents
it is surprising how few commands
are issued by the C. of E. leaders.
They are wise. It is no good attack-
ing with an untrained army. Another
good thing about the C. of E.: with all its
faults it does stick to the people. This is
true of the R.C. Church also. The other
churches have developed a mania for sub-
urbia. It is the business of the churches to
unlift the families, and it is a good thing to
know that there is a constant migration from
congested areas of the frugal to their own
homes in the suburbs. But this produces two
problems. There is the provision of new
Sunday schools and churches in the rising
suburbs for this healthy migration. This is
the easier problem. The harder one is to
carry on in the congested areas in spite of
the constant loss of the frugal and prosper-
ing famil'es. The situation is exactly the
reverse of actual warfare. In that, the old
line becomes the base and the new line be-
comes the firing-line. With the churches it
is the old line which is ever the firing-line.
It is also the hard recruiting-ground, and, to
change the figure, the quarry from which
the new pillars of the church must be hewn.
Methodists, Presbyterians and Congrega-
tionalists have got into the habit of abandon,
ing the firing-line. Scores of churches and
parsonages have been sold in the congested
areas; only the C. of E. and the R.C. hang
on usually. Not only that, but such other
churches as are retained are served by a
hireling ministry from suburbia who do not
love their people sufficiently to live among
them, or their job enough to be on it. In
many districts the only clergy left are C. of
E. and R.C. There are thus seven visiting
ministers who from their pleasant suburban
pastures administer the cure of souls for
Surry Hills, leaving the C. of E. man to
answer the needs of the whole Protestant
population. I will admit that the Congre-
gational minister is quite near —near enough
to answer every call —but there are still seven
“attache-case ministers” associated with the
work. It is largely the same for Waterloo,
Redfern, Alexandria, Miller’s Point and
Woolloomooloo (where, the only resident
ministers are C. of E. and R.C.). The C. of
E. does not usually sell its churches and par-
sonages at the first sign of trouble. It sticks
on the job. There are other things that
might be advanced to explain the dispropor-
tion of the increase as between the C. of E.
and the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congre-
gational churches. One disability is either a
virtue or a vice as different people look at
it. That is, that for the last two decades
these churches have been hindered by the
internal agitation and discussion as to their
proposed union. The question is, “Should
they drop it and get on with their work, or
get on with it, finish it and get on with their
enlarged objective?” There is no doubt about
what the verdict of the outside public would
be. The man in the street sees no need for
the multiplication of churches, and his ver-
dict would be, “Get done with it and pull
together. The time for talking is passed.
Act!” Yours, James Green.

Doctors and Politics.
“Macquarie Street” on his brethren: —
Doctors have a small chance of achieving more than
a moderate success in a field so much ont of their
line as politics, and I have never heard of one of
them making a lasting reputation in Australia or
the Cold Country, though in Prance Clemenceau
made a name that would satisfy the most ravenous.
Arising out of the recent Federal re-shuffle there is
the possibility of one, if not two, of our profes-
sion making good, and leaving a mark on Aus-
tralian history. Nevertheless, I would be astonished
if a Government led by a medico occupied the
Treasury benches for any length of time. Medicine
and politics are as hopelessly incompatible as bicar-
bonate of soda and hydrochloric acid. Even if a
doctor gives up his professional work and devotes
himself exclusively to his political duties the case is
not much altered. His medical training is dead against
his rising to the top of the tree, and remaining
there. By training and education he shrinks from
the methods of political jobbers, and cannot flourish
in an atmosphere of intrigue and lies. Innate dis-
like of self-advertisement is another bar, though
I admit that there have been some notable excep-
tions to this rule. Nearly every one of us, when a
reporter requires an opinion on a medical subject,
declines to supply him with the information unless
he promises to withold the name of his informant.
That’s the rule by which our conduct is governed,
and (thank Heaven!) most of us stick to it. Thus
in the nature of things doctors are bound to get left
behind in the scramble for office.
In the Cold Country much was expected from the
appointment of a doctor as the first Minister for
Health, and I got tired of reading in the medical
journals of the reforms that were to be introduced
for the betterment of the rank and file of the
medical profession. But I don’t remember Dr. Addi-
son achieving any wonderful reform-—for one thing
he did not last long enough—--and his place was filled
by the usual type of business man. In N. S. Wales
Dr. Richard Arthur may be taken as a typical
example of the political medico. He has had a
fair run for his money, but lias never attained
Cabinet rank, or got beyond mediocrity, and in his case
want of success cannot be attributed to backward-
ness in trying, or hiding his light under a bushel.
He is interested in everything, from bad roads to
sunshine for children, and nothing of importance—or
unimportance, either —happens without him making
an appearance with a few well-chosen words. But
something has kept him back, and it can’t be want
of ability, altogether. Had he received a business
instead of a medical training, there is little doubt
that he. would have made good, and left his mark.
It is on Neville Howse and Earle Page that
the hopes of the profession rest to bring it honor
and glory, and things are shaping well. Neville
Howse is a great surgeon and proved it in Orange
for many years. He would have done just as well
in Sydney, and often contemplated the change, but
his health had to be considered. He is a born ad-
ministrator, and has had considerable experience both
at home and abroad. He hates the limelight like all the
best men in his profession, and is modest to a fault.
I remember him promising to show his V.C. to a
nurse in the hospital where he worked for so many
years, but in the end pleading that he had mislaid
the bauble, and it was never produced. As for
Earle Page, in addition to his exceptional skill as
a surgeon he is a sound business man, and is cap-
able of buying a station in Queensland or doing .an
appendicectomy with equal coolness and knowledge.
No, on the whole, I don’t think doctors should
touch politics! If they must have some relief from
the tedium of practice, let them renew their ac-
quaintance with the classics, learn modern
languages, or saturate their minds with modern
literature- —there is some. Let them write a novel,
or a book of essays, as some have* done, not unsuc-
cessfully. I know one distinguished member of
our profession, in Sydney, who is quite capable
of writing a very interesting history of the British
Navy. It would be something after the style of
the one contemplated but never carried out by
the immortal Samuel Pepys who, as Secretary of
the Navy and the Stuarts, had unsurpassed advan-
tages and opportunities for the task. Our potential
historian’s manner, walk and gestures are of the
salt sea, and he reminds me of Masefield’s song:
“I must go down to the sea again,
To the lovely sea and the sky.”
But he still sticks fairly close to Medicine. That
science has a powerful attraction for its disciple—
and if he is happy there he would be a fool who would
forsake it for such a thing of shreds and patches as
politics.
A Bulwark for the Territory.
A lot of people have ideas as to how the
welfare of the Northern Territory may be
best promoted, but the Rev. J. C. Needham,
Chairman of the Australian Board of Mis-
sions, has hit on the most original specific
yet proffered to the Federal Government.
Quoth this doubtless estimable cleric in the
course of an a’ddress, mostly dealing with
racial problems, at Toowong (Q.) :
His solution to save Australia for the Australians
was the filling of the Northern Territory with
their 70,000 aboriginals. The aboriginal was their
greatest asset in the settling of the empty tracts
of the Par North. They were a nomadic race, but
under segregation and religious influences they could
be gradually brought to a state of civilisation which
wculd ensure the develonmerit of the empty North,
and also set up a wall against the incursion of
the Asiatic races.

aborigines at the census of April, 1921 ia

were possible to yard them up and overland

segregation, religious influences, drill, instruc-
tion in anti-Malthusianism, etc-., that would
constitute them a wall against Asiatic incur-
sion, might be interesting subjects for aca-
demic discussion. The Rev. Needham’s recipe
tor keeping the Territory Australian vaguely
reminds one of a scheme that was approved
in the W. A. Parliament in 1896, when Big-
John F orrest was consul, for preventing the
rabbits from rounding the shores of the Bight.
A hundred domestic cats were collected in
. erth and given to a coasting skipper with
instructions to turn them loose in the sand-
hills at a point east of Eucla. Still, the
X\ .A. plan differed in one respect from the
Kev. Needham’s— the cats were sent there,
although what became of them after they
were liberated was never definitely ascer-
tained.
The Missionary and the Miner.
“Boukagi” on Papuan exploration:—
Governor Murray and Captain Hurley have been
at issue on the subject of Papua. They are, how-
ever, agreed on one point at least: the ignorance of
the average Australian on the subject of the very
rich tropical country which is practically his free-
hold. Much of the distorted information he has
must, he debited to that exceedingly well-intentioned
class of pioneers, the missionary. In Sydney
a few days <ago a Miss ,C. Neale lectured
on behalf of the Australian Board of Mis-
sions on the hardships of the early mission-
aries and the growth of the movement. Miss Neale
certainly belongs to the Anglican Mission, which,
with the R.C.’s, has a deserved reputation of hard
work for very small material reward. But that
does not prevent her from using threadbare wheezes
about sinful white traders and murderous miners,
though if any Mission has cause to respect the
Papuan diggers it is Miss Neale’s. Her state-
ment that after the first miners visited the Mamba
certain amount of fighting took place is amusing,
hat happened was that the pioneer party was
attacked by supposedly friendly natives and
many of them killed, without provocation. It was
Governor Macgregor who came along later and slew
the natives. Statements that the miners were forced
to leave “The Island” because of the Mamba natives
are merely ridiculous. In a different category is
the lady’s further assertion that “whenever white
men went to New Guinea for their personal gain,
blood had been shed, and the natives had absolutely
refused to make terms with the whites.” That
both is so untrue and unjust that it calls for re-
proof. The writer knew Papua, or part of it, in
the hey-day of the Northern goldfields, and he is
able to say with absolute certainty that the attitude
of the prospectors and miners of those days towards
the natives was admirable. Men like Little,
Crowe, the Prykes and dozens of others, who
ranged ahead even of the Government officials, and
so far ahead of the missionary that the latter rarely
saw their dust, made it their boast that in years of
prospecting they had never taken a native life.
Knowing the men, I am convinced they spoke truth,
liven when the brutal murder of Campion and King
by allegedly friendly natives on the Upper Kumusi
roused the Yodda miners, they took no steps for
reprisals, but notified the officials, who went in
pursuit of the murderers. As to the natives refus-
ing to make terms with the whites —well, such men
as Oates, Clunas and others had a far higher stand-
ing with the Northern division natives—outside the
missionary compounds—than any missionary I ever
met. Miss Neale's final statement that any mur-
ders of whites which had taken place were in revenge
for wrongs inflicted by white men is another com-
monplace of missionary cant. A very big proportion
of Papuan peoples, including the Anglican Mission’s
own special parishioners, the Binandele, never hesi-
tated at robbery or murder of white men or fellow-
Papuan, if they thought the game was safe. One
regrets the necessity of flatly contradicting a lady
who is only, probably, voicing the platitudes she has
heard repeated in her isolated circle. Something,
though, is due to the memory of my old Papuan
mates who have gone prospecting where, the mis-
sionary tells us, the gold goes an ounce to the dish.
One way of fastening odium on a prisoner
before a trial begins was adopted by tin;
Victorian police in the Unidentified Corpse
case which has come as a boon and a bless-
ing to Melbourne horror-mongers. A woman
having been arrested, she naturally applied
for bail. Thus far no coroner’s jury has
put a name to the corpse, or brought any
sort of verdict against anybody, known or
unknown. The woman arrested may not
even have to stand a trial, so the application
to be released on bail was fair and reason-
able. The police, however, opposed, offering,
in default of a reason, the excuse that they
were afraid the woman would commit suicide
if she were allowed out of prison. Thus did
they give the world to suppose* that the un-
convicted prisoner must be guilty of what-
ever crime they hoped to charge her with,
otherwise she wouldn’t want to kill herself
in desperation. Also they influenced the
mind of a probable future jury by suggesting
that the Crown case is so strong that a big,
courageous-looking female suspect has
given herself up for lost and is anxious to die
before the gun goes off. Are the police ever
fully conscious of the outrages on Justice
they commit in the ordinary way of handling
a Mysterious Corpse case?
“Country Ped” on non-freehold titles:—
The Queensland Government, in offering land for
selection for cotton-growing, declares war on land-
lordism, and intends to grant perpetual leaseholds
instead of freehold. The Government of Victoria
tried something similar when it broke up large
estates for closer settlement a few years ago, and
its experience will almost certainly be Theodore’s.
After the expiration of the payment period, instead
of giving a title certificate a Crown grant was
offered—the so-called “spotted title.” This stipu-
lated that the Closer Settlement Board must be con-
sulted re all sales and purchases, and it was re-
quired to veto the acquisition of more property of
this kind by any occupier of land. The idea was
all right in theory and all wrong in practice; the
settlements got to a certain point and then stag-
nated. In times of stress the holders of these
Crown grants found it almost useless to apply
to the banks for assistance; the title was not
good enough. Finally the present Victorian Govern-
ment repealed the troublesome clause, and freehold
was granted. The writer recently visited Werribee,
some 20 miles from Melbourne. Two years ago this

To-day the place is a hive of activity. Houses
are being built, improved, or as fast as
builders can do the work. The granting of free-
hold has made all the difference. Leasehold will
never hold the same attractions as freehold to
the land-seeker. The difference is between “This
doesn t belong to me—why bother to improve it?”
and “This is mine. This is where I will make
my home.’’ It is the home-maker that every dis-
trict needs.

“Flicker” on unwelcome little strangers :■ —
“Chancery Lane” (B. 8/2/’23) is not altogether
right in throwing his bouquets to S. Aus. for its
attitude on the legitimisation of pre-nuptial births.
He states that in S. Aus. “the marriage of the
parents automatically legitimates the pre-nuptial
child.” There are two Acts on this subject, 1898
and 1902, and neither of them goes as far as
“Chancery Lane” says. In S. Aus. the parents
must make declaration before a Begistrar of Births,
expressing their desire to legitimatise the child,
showing that no legal impediment to marriage existed
at the birth of the child (a big handicap in some
cases), and submitting a certificate of marriage. This
is far from “automatic,” especially the part which
concerns the legal ability to contract marriage at
the time of the child’s birth, which rules out the
child of, say, a married man and a single girl, who
afterwards legally marry. Also, in S. Aus., parents
can show preference to one or more of their pre-
nuptial offspring, just as, according to “Chancery
Lane,” they can in other States. A father here
can legitimatise one, or all —or none —just as he
pleases. So S. Aus. is not yet the Paradise of the
Pre-nuptial—nor is there any State in the Com-
monwealth which lets marriage alone “automatically”
legitimatise a child born out of wedlock.

it will probably be named many other things
equally uninspiring before it needs a name

have been suggested to meet Australian

or attempted, a now-forgotten colony there’
and aimed at pushing free settlement up the’

can republic which boldly named itself

turesque. as they might be. But the right
name will turn up, if the right people are
there to recognise it when it turns up.
“S.M.”: Simultaneously with the voicing
of a stern complaint about the lack of
Australian news in the English press, the
S. M. Herald (13/2/ ! 23) filled a long-felt
want in the way of European information
for Australia. In an article headed “Bes-
sarabia' it dealt with the basis of Soviet
Kussia’s claim to that province after a
trenchant fashion:
Bessarabia united with Russia in 1812. Till then
it constituted a part of the Danubian province of
Moldavia which, under the common name of Wal-
lachia, was possessed by the Turks. Roumania was,
y 1 1877, proclaimed an independent State by the
Berlin Congress after having been liberated and
set up by Russian arms, but on the condition that
she should cede that part of Bessarabia detached
from Russia by the; Paris Congress in 1856, in
exchange for the much larger territory of Dob-
roudja, thus giving her access to the sea. Rou-
mania thus had a moral obligation to Russia for
the very fact of her existence owing' to Russian
exertions.
vr rat * lei ‘ a neat piece of misinformation.
Moldavia never existed “under the common
name of Wallachia” (the adjacent province),
lhe two officially took the name of Roumania
m 1861, and in 1866 they imported the in-
variable German sovereign and became inde-
pendent in all but name. Roumania wasn’t
m 1877 proclaimed an independent State
by the Berlin Congress,” for that body didn’t
meet till June, 1878. Roumania made itself
independent in 1877. It didn’t exactly owe
its existence to “Russian exertions.” When
the Russians broke themselves against Os-
Dasha’s defences at Plevna in July,
18 < 7, the Prince of Roumania came to their
help with an army on condition he was made
commander-in-chief of the combined forces,
and saved them by his exertions. At the
peace Roumania, by a record act of ingrati-
tude, was forced to give up fertile Bessarabia,
with its large Roumanian population, to the
Russian it had rescued, and take instead
from Bulgaria the Dobroudja, a mere desola-
tmn. Roumania didn’t depend on the ac-
quisition for “access to the sea,” it having
some access before. And it felt no “moral
obligation” to Russia. Rather it cursed the
thankless monster down to his cowhide boots.

Burwood” on land sharks’ methods:- —
All over Melbourne’s outer eastern suburbs one sees
huge boards advertising building blocks for sale in
various “desirable estates,” mostly grazing paddocks.
I was waiting outside the blacksmith’s the other
morning when Billjim hopped off the tram at the
teuninus, and hailed me with: “Look, whereabouts
is Oldbobbin’s Estate? Can I do it in five
minutes?” I indicated the locality, three miles
away, and said he might get there in the time if he
had an aeroplane. He swore deeply and unfolded
Ins tale of woe. He was from Maldon, and with
six of his mates had bought blocks in Oldbobbin’s
Estate, on the strength of an agent’s plan showing
“proposed tramline” going past the land, and pro-
posed store, post-office and school, all within five
minutes of the tram terminus. They were to pay a
note a month, and get a receipt for each until toe
allotment was paid for. I suggested they were
easygoing, up that way, and he disclosed the crown-
ing piece of deception. “He said Bannister, the
publican, had taken up 15 blocks, and showed us
his cheque for the money. Bannister is pretty
shrewd, and we reckoned it was good enough for
us. But we found out afterwards that the blanky
agent said he didn’t like carrying too many loose
notes about—would Bannister mind giving him his
crossed cheque for £l5 in exchange for notes? When
Bannister told us that, it made us sort o’ suspici-
ous.” And that’s why 60 per cent, of the blocks
sold are slung up after two or three payments. If
the police haven’t an eye glued on these travelling
agents they are missing a lot.
“The Wanderer”: There is something
wrong with the administration of the N. S.
Wales Local Government Department when
so much consideration is demanded for main
roads and so little given to the opening- up
of by-roads. What the average Shire Coun-
cil needs to-day is not so much the injunction
to spend £ tor £ on main roads along with
Government grant allotted, but to utilise
more ot its own money in providing settlers
and would-be settlers with means of getting
to main roads with their produce. The
Local Government Department appears to
labor under the delusion that the main roads
which the touring motor uses are the onlv
ones on the map. Thus it is that many a
poor cocky who has to carry his cream on
horseback on to a main road, in order to
eventually land it at a butter factory, curses
with a huge curse the Local Government
Department, Shire Councils and everythin"
es e that he can conveniently blas'pheme
about. He can t curse his road — he has
none.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It looks as if the disabled Digger may have
a better spin under Bruce and Page than
ever he had under Hughes. He may be a
bit of a nuisance sometimes, but if he is we
have probably made him one by promising
to give him a fair deal and then stacking
the cards. It is most unjust, at any rate, to
judge him by the few who make a parade of
their injuries. Thousands of others are
hiding wounds and other disabilities which
keep them from earning what they would
have earned otherwise, and into the bargain
are suffering pain and anxiety. Their coun-
try. which implored them to go and fight,
and promised to see that they didn’t lose by
it if they lived, can’t compensate them for
their pain and anxiety, but it can see that
they are not losers otherwise. The old, dis-
graceful policy was “Give ’em a little if
you must, but nothing at all if you can man-
age it.” The new one ought to be: “These
men offered everything and gave much. Now
if we can’t afford to be generous, we’ve got
at least to be just.”
The old story, as set out in the daily paper :
Speaking at Dapto, Mr. Austin Chapman, Minister
for Customs, said he hoped the advent of ihis
Ministry would mean that, in regard to the policy
we have so often preached about opening new ports
and opening up the country, we will cease talk
and do something....
These Federal politicians yearn to take the
large Australian view, and to open up the
closed ports, so that population may be dif-
fused in the waste places, etc., knowing
perfectly well that they can do nothing with-
out the consent of the State Governments.
Also knowing that the State Governments
wouldn’t consent if asked, though to make
assurance doubly sure they never are asked.
Mat Charlton, Federal Labor-leader, also
put the vote-catching hook on his Federal
programme where it was quite harmless. But
State Labor Ministers like Estell grew pale
blue with rage and almost incoherent when
the subject was mentioned. Chapman and
Charlton can prove their sincerity by com-
bining to open up Darwin with a railway,
that being not only within their power, but
strictly their business. But that sort of
descent from the skyey heights of aspiration
to plain fact is a dull business.
Fuller. Lawson, Barwell, Mitchell and
Hayes, the five Liberal State Premiers, will
bring all the pressure they can on the Bruce-
Pages to free State instrumentalities from
the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbi-
tration Court. Bavin (N.S.W.) and Robin-
son (Vic.), two of the State Law Ministers,
talk of having Federal Referring Bills passed
to pave the way for a Commonwealth mea-
sure. The Privy Council’s refusal of special
leave to appeal to itself against the High
Court’s decision in the recent test case has
stirred things up. But while they are about
it they might return to sanity and remove
the public’s employees from the jurisdiction
of all courts. Certainly if there is a case
for removing State servants out of the juris-
diction of the Federal Court, on the two
grounds that those who pay the piper should
call the tune and that the States can be
trusted to do a fair thing, then there is no
justification for interposing a court between
the State Parliaments and their servants.
Or the Federal either, for that matter.
The fact that S. Australia is represented
in the Bruce-Page Cabinet only by a sort of
supernumerary Minister, and tliat even he is
out of the way in the Senate, probably means
that the two-headed Government doesn’t
want any skeleton at the feast, reminding
it that the Commonwealth accepted from
S.A. a land grant of 200,000 acres per mile
to build the South-to-North railway along
a certain route, and that no railway is forth-
coming. In fact, the last Government with
which 4-Prime Minister Bruce was connected
used to refer to the repudiation of the plain
business agreement with all the affability of
a Bolshevik discussing the repudiation of
the public debt.
Premier Barwell (S.A.) made some com-
plaint about his State being represented in
the new Cabinet only by an unpaid Minister
without portfolio, and him a Senator. Where-
upon 4-Prime Minister Bruce “rebuked” him
in his best softgoods manner, saying his
august attention had been attracted by Bar-
well’s remarks, and “I very much regret
them, as they certainly do not tend to pro-
mote that great Australian national spirit
which the war did so much to create.” This
is a stern warning to the mere local politi-
EVERYTHING IN THE GARDEN’S WEEDY.
"The first thing Mr. Bruce and Dr. Page intend to do is to look into the pigeon-holes with a view
to wielding the pruning-knife in the various Federal departments.”— Press item.
THE KID: “ Pruning-knife be blowed! Cut out the comedy and hoe into ’em with these!”
cian to keep out of Federal concerns, even
when his own State is interested. The
next time Theodore and his colleagues want
to steal S.A.’s Federal railway for Queens-
land, it is to be hoped Bruce will “rebuke”
them also —if he has the courage. Further,
that he will rebuke them hard, as they have
been offending for years.
“Revelations of the most serious character”
about prominent Laborites are made so regu-
larly before Labor committees that it is al-
most a marvel any prominent or other
Laborite has any character left. One of the
late N.S.W. Government’s “Labor” appoint-
ments being questioned, it is solemnly alleged
that, instead of being qualified by three years’
membership of the A.L.P., the gentleman had
no discoverable membership at all; that he
couldn’t be traced at his alleged branch ; that
he failed, after several months’ search, to
produce his ticket, or any ticket; that he
didn’t live within 70 miies of his alleged
branch; that the only documents (some
ticket-butts) which tend to justify the ap-
pointment are “faked” (or plain forged) ;
that the appointee didn’t even show signs of
possessing Labor principles or contritions,
or the rudiments of veracity; that money
(apparently bribe-money) passed; and that
the Minister involved was party to the
iniquity for his own ends, which, of course,
were dashed bad ends. The Labor crowd does
these things thoroughly when it is about
them—like that Maoriland congregation
which dispensed with its pastor on the
plea that he had become an atheist, was
ignorant of theology, backed the wrong horse
consistently, and had three wives.
The N.S.W. Premier loafed away to Lon-
don leaving a sketchy but grandiose plan for
great “resumptions for closer settlement,”
and the planting of 38,000 new farmers on
wheat areas of 1000 acres each. One stand-
by of the proposal is the country north of
Bourke, it being held that the area watered
by the (more or less) rivers Narran, Bok-
hara, Culgoa, etc., should never have been
included in the Western Division. Now the
Ma State is thankful that the proposed
wholesale eviction of sheep-men to make
room for wheat-men hasn’t happened yet.
The wheat crop of the north-west and west
is turning out 25,000,000 bushels below the
estimate, which estimate provided a fair liv-
ing but no great fortune for the growers;
and the railway revenue would show a slump
of about £1,500,000, only that an extra-bril-
liant wool season will partly compensate. If
the gigantic settlement chimera had come off
the wheat slump would probably be of 250
million bushels instead of 25 millions, and
the railway loss would be in proportion.
Pushing sheep off passable stock country to
make way for wheat that will only grow there
occasionally is going to dig a hole in many
at-present unsuspecting taxpayers’ pockets.
“J. E.” : I would suggest to these North-
ern N.S.W. people who want to call their
New State after Byron or Lawson or some
other poet that the obvious name stares
them in the face. Cape Byron is the. most
easterly point of Australia and there is noth-
ing due east of it nearer than Chili. So the
New State is Easterland and the people are
Easterlings. There was an Easterland once,
and its Easter inhabitants invented easter-
ling or sterling money (rival theories re the
origin of the word are disqualified) ; but as
that old Hanseatic League has gone out of
business the name is available.
On an election with an early-Victorian
flavor: —
The Rockhampton by-election was a tumultuous
business. For a decade or more the seat has been
a soft thing for Labor—Forde’s majority in 1920
was just on two to one—but the voting in the
subdivision on December 16 was close enough to
suggest that the other side might scrape in with a
good man. The mayor was persuaded to nominate,
and for a time the going was good. Then some
of the amazing asses who support the Opposition
decided to make victory certain by reviving an
expedient described by Thackeray in “The New-
comes.” They dug up an interesting female
who imputed lawless frivolity to the Labor man
(he denied it stoutly) and produced what she
alleged to be the consequence of the manoeuvre.
Thereafter the Wronged Woman and the Illicit
Infant absorbed public attention to the exclusion
of all other issues. Round them raged about 547
fights. But the effect was precisely the opposite
to what the lady’s . discoverers intended. .It
was so damaging to the Gnashers that a leading
member of their campaign committee resigned in
disgust and there is good ground for believing
that if the candidate had followed his own inclina-
tions he would have retired also. Angrily repudiat-
ing responsibility for the lady, he went to the
poll and was beaten by 949 votes. Theodore’s
strongest card is the imbecility of his opponents.
While the Liquor Licensing Bill was be-
fore Vic. Parliament members talked of the
half-million Bung would spend on structural
improvements if he had security of tenure.
But now that he has eight years’ steady
business to look forward to without local-
option interruption, he doesn’t seem in a
hurry to build. In open court Barr, chair-
man of the Licenses Reduction Board, has
suggested (1) that owners had better not
wait for him and his colleagues, Lock and
Tanner, to use the bayonet, and (2) that
nervous licensees should sell out to others
with courage and enterprise. The Board has
made it plain that it will not be patient
with pubs which rely exclusively on their
bar trade and keep cobwebby rooms for
exterior effect.
If the 11 Bruce-Page Ministers liked, they
could all join the A.N.A. But theirs isn’t
the first native-born Government, as has
been widely stated. After Playford’s resigna-
tion on Jan. 24, 1907 (Tom was a Cockney),
the second Deakin Ministry, which carried
on till November 13, 1908, was wholly com-
posed of Australians, namely Deakin,
Mauger, Best and Hume Cook (Victorians),
Chapman and Tom Ewing (Ma Staters),
Lyne and Keating (Tasmanians), Groom
(Queenslander) and Forrest (Westralian).
In the original Barton Ministry the only
exotic was Dickson, who died nine days after
his appointment. He was succeeded by
Drake, another Englishman.
The N. S. Wales taxpayer subsidises coun-
try hospitals, but apparently exercises little
or no supervision over them. He is not re-
presented on the managing committees: they
are composed of men usually inexperienced
in the care of the sick, and in a good many
cases the matron is judged by financial re-
sults. If she ’s “economical” she is a good
matron, even though she starves her patients
m me process. The Bulletin gets so
many complaints on this score that it looks
as though the matter requires attention.
Wearne and all the Ministers who are en-
gaged in land-settlement propaganda are in-
terested in this, or ought to be; for you
can’t get people to stay in the country, even
if you get them there, unless you provide
them with decent facilities for treatment in
sickness.
The Irish Republican party has established
an “organisation,” with branches throughout
Victoria, and proposes to spread over the
Commonwealth. It has also started a "paper.
The object is to raise money and recruits
with which to conduct a brigandish kind of
civil war against the elected Parliament and
the legitimate Government of a sister
Dominion. The effrontery of the idea passes
understanding. If the Bruce-Page Ministry
allows this to go on it may receive despatches
from Dublin and London which may be
models of impolite letter-writing.
The N. S. Wales Government is being
yelled at all round to push on harder with
the city railway. It shouldn’t listen until
it is satisfied that it is getting a fair thing
for its money. Indications are that every
shovelful of earth that is shifted is costing
two or three times more than it should. Of
course, it has been like that for years past
on most N.S.W. railway works, partly in
consequence of which not one-eighth of the
mileage opened during the past dozen years
is paying; and, in spite of the crushing in-
creases in fares and freights, the taxpayer
is being bled to pay over £900,000 a year of
,fche interest on the non-paying lines.
The spectres in the lobbies: —
It is pathetic to see the rejected wandering about
Federal Parliament House unable to tear themselves
away from the scenes of modest triumphs. Since
he was thrown out three or four years back, Archi-
bald, once a Minister for Home Affairs, has been
a frequent visitor, and his queer little podgy figure,
with the head thrust out, as if in pursuit of the
pipe it is holding so grimly, may be seen many
a day creeping- upstairs. But Archibald is a philo-
sopher, and he accepts obscurity as the inevitable
reward of the public man. Not so McWilliams,
whose lament at the ingratitude of constituents
will be poured into" any ear willing to receive it
He appears to be now some sort of honorary coun-
sellor to the Country crowd, and always seems to
be bursting with confidential information.
Then there is Massy Greene, a silent spectre
that invites commiseration. He never whines.
But the grey face and the subdued eye
tell their own tale; he is suffering keenly. The
blow is the heavier because (1) he was building
a home in a Melbourne suburb in evident expecta-
tion of a long term in Parliament, and (2) he was,
as events have turned out, the next in succession
for the job of Prime Minister. Few l politicians
have had worse luck. It affords a painful contrast
to the unprecedented good fortune of Bruce.
A BALLAD OF SPATTERDASHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sydney pressmen found the new Prime Minister
suave, courteous and beautifully dressed, a notable
contrast to his peevish and frequently explosive pre-
decessor, Mr. Hughes.— Daily paper item , reinforced
with a photo of Mr. Bruce.
There’s noblesse oblige, as it were,
And aristocratic repose
In the exquisite cleft of his hair,
Aligned with the tip of his nose.
His ties are impeccable bows;
His coats are a dream, while his hats
The taste of a Brummel disclose;
But the crown of his glory is spats.
Of cuffs he exhibits a pair,
As white as Antarctica’s snows;
His collar is glossily fair
As ever was Birmingham Joe’s;
Arrayed like a lily or rose
To pressmen urbanely he chats,
And bravely the black of his toes
Contrasts with the buff of his spats.
In the pants' there is artistry rare,
Each crease so immaculate shows;
And one would be loath to declare
He hasn’t got clocks on his hose.
In keeping ’twould be, I suppose,
AA’ith the rest of his raiment —but that’s
A secret that nobody knows,
A mystery hidden in spats.
Could any Prime Minister swear
In such irreproachable pose,
Consign you to blazes and blare
Out phrases explosive as those
That Hughes not infrequently chose?
Could be sourly ejaculate “Rats!”
In fashion-plate splendors that close
AVith the latest and smartest in spats?
Envoy.
The snarl and the petulant glare
Give way to caresses and pats.
Ho! varlets the Presence who dare,
AA’hefe a lion late roared in his lair
Is a quiet, polite, debonair
And radiant vision in spats.

The £277,722 profit: disclosed for the past
12 months was easily a record, the next best
having been £215,019 for 1915. Since that
year the accounts have shown the effects
of abnormal conditions —high working costs,
dear coal, heavy freight charges, industrial
upheavals, and other troubles —but except
in two years the regular 13 p.c. div. was
easily earned. Lately, everything has been
going the co.’s way: so much so that during
the past 12 months prices have been lowered
Sd. per 1000 ft., and since early in December 6s.
per 1000 ft. has been charged. The accounts
show that during the latter six months of
the year the co. was averaging 6s. 2.8 d. per
1000 ft. on sales apart from public lighting,
compared with 6s. 7.3 d. for the December
term of 1921. The latest reduction means
that Melbourne is now being charged
£120,000 p.a. less for its gas than it would
have to pay under the prices of 12 months
ago. Lowered freights and “a return to
conditions unaffected by industrial disturb-
ances” are claimed to have effected the reduc-
tion of working costs, though wages have
meanwhile increased. Also, Melbourne con-
tinues to expand: last year’s sales, measured
in cubic feet, increased 10.34 p.c. on those
of 1921. Here are comparisons with 1918,
which the management regards as the “last
preceding normal year” :
1918. 1921. 1922.

Gas sold(1000ft.) . . 3,435,689 3,451,448 3,808,633
Last half-year each ton of coal produced an
average of 13,729 c. ft. of gas; for the
December term of 1921, 13,281 c. ft..; in
1920, 13,341 c. ft.; and in 1918, 13,728 c. ft.
Quality of coal, plus retorting efficiency, has
therefore, restored gas production to normal.
The profits shown in the introductory
table are not net earnings: repairs and
maintenance are charged up with working
costs —almost £162,000 for the past year—
but no cut is made for depreciation. In
the following comparison of the principal
revenue-account groups, repairs and main-
tenance are included with “other manufac-
turing costs” :

During the past. 12 months £73,500 of profit
was transferred to the reserve fund and
£26,000 to capital account. Depreciation,
etc., is dealt with in these accounts: the
whole of the £26,000 disappeared to cover
the “cost of plant condemned as useless,”
and £52,093 of the reserve appropriations
went in “expenditure for extension and im-
provement of plant and contingencies.”
Actual depreciation requirements are not
ascertainable; but there is no doubt that for
many years substantial amounts of revenue,
over and above depreciation requirements,
were employed to add to the co.’s assets.
That has to be considered when casting the
eye on the handful in the reserve fund. The
£704,076 of reserves shown in the introduc-
tory table is made up of: —
Share premiums . . . . . . £584,210
Reserve fund .. . . . . 35,557
Meter renewal fund . . .. 15,431
P. and L. balance .. . . 68,878
At the annual meeting vice-chairman John
Higgins declared that the reserve fund was
“far below the amount which should be car-
ried by a co. conducting a business of such
magnitude and operating with a capital of
over three millions.” Tne Act under which
the co. is incorporated allows for a reserve
fund not exceeding one-eighth of total share
and borrowed capital, and at present up to
£306,250 could be so held. The directors are
entirely to blame for the meagre visible re-
serves. For many years profits were put
into plant and written off so that the co.
might not offer too easy a target for its
many enemies; and, later on, when true pro-
fits were less, they were unduly cut into to
maintain the 13 p.c. dividend.
Of course, that rate of div. does not repre-
sent the actual return to shareholders, many
of whom paid stiff premiums on their
contributions to the co.’s capital. Besides
the million in ordinaries- —200,000 shares of
£5 each —and £584,210 of share premiums,
the co. employs £1,450,000 of debentures.
Some of the borrowed capital is cheap:
£670,000 carries only 4 p.c., and most of
that is tied to the business until 1938-’42.
Nearly two years ago the directors raised
another half-million, and, perhaps misjudging
the money market, committed the co. to 8
p.c. until the issue matures in 1936.

ing the past two years Is. per share (£7500)
was got in from the contribs., and earnings
have so revived that for the latter half of
last year the div. rate was elevated to 8 p.c.
again. For many years prior to 1909 regular
10 p.c. were distributed. But electric compe-
tition had arrived and the co. had disposed
of the engineering section of its business.
It eventually passed into the hands of
its electric competitor. The reason for
the separation was that under its Act the co.
was obliged to share with the City Council
any profits divided in excess of 10 p.c. Since
1915 the co. has again run its own engin-
eering works, and net earnings have improved.
The recovery has been better than the table
indicates: during the past five years renewals
have been provided for out of revenue; prior
to that appropriations were made from dis-
closed profits. That remark also applies to
this comparison of income and outgo:—

Compared with four years, ago revenue is up
£20,241, but it has cost £18,765 more, apart
from extra taxation, to win it.
Larger reserves are also assisting to
improve earnings: assuming the assets
are worth 20s. in the £ there is
£65,000 odd helping the £120,000 of
paid capital. The latest net profit was only
6 p.c. on total funds. The reserves are made
vip of £21,000 in a general reserve fund,
£2OOO set aside for equalisation of divs.,
£40,000 in a plant renewal and contingency
account, £5OO reserved for stock fluctuations,
and £644 balance of P. and L. In the in-
troductory table reserves are shown less
£15,000 represented by Parliamentary rights
and concessions. The extent of actual re-
serves depends on whether any portion of the
£40,000 set aside for renewals and contin-
gencies will be required for those purposes.
Practically all of the co.’s funds are sunk
in the undertaking. In the next com-
parison stocks (£10,468) are included with
liquid assets:—

The installation of a secondary power-sta-
tion-to provide additional hydraulic-power for
wool-dumping on Woolloomooloo wharves has
lately cut into cash assets. Deducting the
final div. from the surplus at December 31,
the co. had only £12,489 of total capital and
reserves in assets other than properties,
mains, plant, etc.

The Australian General Omnibus float :-
This co. is being formed to “acquire and maintain
a standard omnibus service, primarily throughout the
entire metropolitan district of Sydney, and to invite
and encourage existing omnibus cos. and owners to
join the co.” The Government Tramways having
failed to cope with the traffic of the city, in the
past few years numerous syndicates and individuals
have placed an assortment of motor ’buses on the
roads. Many of these services over-lap, they are in
various stages of efficiency and otherwise, and there
is no co-ordination or organisation. Nevertheless,
many of them are making good profits. The A.G.O.C.
aims to amalgamate or buy out existing services,
standardise chassis and establish central repair work-
shops. On paper, a big saving should be effected by
standardisation and by getting the services under one
efficient organisation. The lengthy prospectus makes
out a good case for this aspect of the enterprise.
But it is less talkative on vital matters of finance.
Nominal capital is a million, and for a start 470,000
£1 shares are offered; but “it is not proposed to
effect calls, as far as practicable, beyond 10s. per
share.” Half a million shares are being held in
reserve, and 30,000 fullv-paids are to be issued “as
purchase consideration of options and flotation of
co.” Precisely what subscribers are offered for these
goodwill shares is not explained by the prospectus.
First there is an unspecified charge which the pro-
moters are making for having introduced the scheme
to the public; the balance of consideration is evi-
dently wholly for options which have been secured
over existing services. The value of these options,
which are not detailed, but are available for inspec-
tion, depends on the prices which have been arranged
with present proprietors. That is a matter of such
moment to the proposed co. that valuations and re-
ports by experts, independent of the promoters, should
have been incorporated in the prospectus. No doubt,
in the case of good paying runs, goodwill figures
prominently in the purchase prices. That means
that the £30,000 —all in shares —which the pro-
moters are to receive will be only portion of the
goodwill with which the A.G.O.C. will be loaded.
The prospectus announces that “over 40 different
makes” of motor-’buses are now on the roads. So,
if the A.G.O.C. services are to be standardised, one
of the problems ahead of the co. is the disposal of
vehicles transferred and which are considered unsuit-
able. The proposal is to place them “on pioneering
work on new runs.” If all the options are exercised,
and standardisation is to be the policy from the
beginning, there’s evidentally going to be a lot of
pioneering.
A curious anomaly in the prospectus is that,
though it is the intention to restrict calls on the
470,000 shares to 10s. —that plus the £30,000 to
promoters totals £265,000, though an unspecified
issue of shares would be absorbed by option-givers
(some of whom undertake to accept up to 80 p.c. of
their prices in shares) —the profit estimates are based
on capital of half a million. Including £30,000
p.a. which the optimistic promoters think they
will receive from advertising in ’bus interiors, they
estimate a gross profit of 274 p.c. on that capital,
which is expected to provide 200 vehicles and the
workshops, etc. But they do not append details of
contemplated capital outlay, and the profit reckonings
are built on meagre figures. The calculations pro-
vide for £lO,OOO p.a. for depreciation, but no
allowance is made for taxation or contingencies—
such as the probability of the authorities levying
a roads tax.
It is also proposed that the co. should carry its
own insurances: “insurance on each ’bus averages
£3O; on 200 ’buses this amounts to £6090; this
saving represents five new ’buses each year.” Ap-
parently there are to be no losses!
If existing profitable services are secured at reason-
able cost, under its scheme, and with good manage-
ment, the A.G.O.C. should be a payable venture so
long as present traffic conditions continue. Apart
from capital cost and efficient control, the prospects of
the co. depend on how favorable future conditions
will be. The promoters talk confidently of the
probability of the electric trams being “withdrawn
from the city proper when the City Railway is com-
pleted.” Incidentally, the £1,000,000 A.G.O.C. may
not have things all its own way: a number of ’bus
owners have failed to respond to the co.’s invitation
to join or sell, and the Associated Motor ’Bus Pro-
prietors section of the Motor Traders’ Association has
officially announced that it is “considering a pro-
posal for amalgamation of their enterprises.” It has
already invited quotations for standard chassis.

For the 1921 financial year Newcastle-Walls-
end directors disclosed a profit of £23,642,
but that was after £7500 had been visibly
added to the insurance reserve, £5433 to
dividend equalisation reserve, and £3OOO to
a contingency account. On this occasion—
though “throughout the year there had been
an extensive demand for Maitland large coal
and a moderate demand for Borehole large
coal” —the disclosed profit was £BB2 less
than was required to pay 10 p.c., and £8437
of accumulated reserves dropped out. The
Bulletin would be very surprised if those
figures are the actual results for the period.
An examination of the liquid position gener-
ally throws some light on earnings, but
this time comparisons are not of much value
owing to the expenditure at the collieries.
Since 1920 new plant, machinery and elec-
trical equipment have been installed at both
the Wallsend and Felton mines, but the total
outlay has not been disclosed. The book
value of fixed assets has grown £48.425 since
the December, 1920, balance, but meanwhile
there have been cuts for depreciation. De-
spite the insufficiency of latest profits for
shareholders’ divs., trade conditions and the
accounts suggest that the Newcastle-M alls-
end has been doing very well, and that the
co.’s position is still very snug. Balance-
sheet comparisons over four years show this:
1919. 1920. 1921. 1922.
Liabilities ..£42,999 £25,172 £27,888 £24,347
Fixed assets .. 295,270 298,790 321,394 34i,21.l
Liquid assets . . 55,692 97,447 110,575 71,9-1
After payment of the final div. there was a
surplus of liquid assets over all liabilities of
£35,074. That left approximately £215,000
of paid capital to be represented by collieries
and equipment—much of the latter brand-
new —with a book value of £347,221. Un-
like many other coal cos. there has been no
reconstruction in recent years, though in
1914 the directors brought £109,700 of inter-
nal reserves into the light so that paid capital
could be doubled. The co.’s activities on
the Maitland field have been _ subsequent to
that bonus issue. Paid capital is now a
quarter-million, £50,000 having been sub-
scribed, at par, by holders in August, 1920.

A first glance at the accompanying figures—
divs. of 20 p.c. p.a. on £58,500 of capital,
£.32,500 of which is lorofit transferred within
the past half-dozen years—suggests that
there’s more in the “coffee palace” than the
pub. But this happens to be a particularly
fortunate co. —nowadays. If the introduc-
tory table went back to the beginning there
would be an entry to show that after the
Melbourne land-boom £lOO,OOO of capital was
written off, and that until 14 years ago 5
p.c. was the best the directors could do for
£20,000 of scrip. Dater on, when the co. did
better, reserves were steadily accumulated
and £6OOO of new capital was got in :to help.
A few years ago an adjoining property was
purchased and remodelled, and has proved a
good spec. This shows how coffee-palace
receipts and outgo have moved since 1914 :

In addition, the co. last year received £2502
from rents and £2Ol interest from gilt-edged
investments. It also paid away £2021 in
rent, £1790 in interest and contributed £1175
in land and income taxes. The £14,462 net
profit was a record, and jiermitted almost
4f p.c. on capital going to reserves after
distributing 20 p.c. to shareholders. During
the year the A.M.P. Society has become the
mortgagor for £15,000 in place of the Vic.
Savings Bank, but the directors do not dis-
close how much more they have to pay for
this loan. Improvements and renovations
costing £2128 have recently been completed,
but this comparison shows that the co. is
comfortable:—

Besides the £15,000 mortgage there is

not disclosed the terms of payment. Apart
from this £30,000, at December 31 the co.
owed only £4328, and had liquid assets,
mostly cash and Government securities,
totalling £7lBO. Of course, the final div.,
payable the other day-—almost two months
after the balancing date—called for £5850.
Bebarfalds, Ltd., furniture manufacturers
and warehousemen, of Sydney, have decided
to go into the rag trade, and are inviting the
subscription of 100,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. of
£1 each to finance alterations and extensions
to premises and to provide drapery stocks.
The business was established 60 years ago,
and has undergone several reconstructions.
A revaluation as at July 1 last showed a
surplus of assets over liabilities of £209,523,
but £33,393 of that represented goodwill.
George Solomon, who joins the co. as deputy-
managing director to develop its drapery in-
terests, is taking up £30,000 of ordinaries.

The*big C.S.R. is undergoing another of
its periodic “re-arrangements.
years ago the old co. was split m t >
Maoriland and Fiji interests were trans-
ferred to a pup float. The parent _
quarter-million of ordinaries, and individual
shareholders received one gift o p.c. pier,
for every share previously held. ‘
issue of 3-i millions was provided by writing
up assets to that extent. Last year halt
of this pref. issue was returned, together
with a bonus of 255. per share (£263,120).
Now the directors, with their customary air
of mystery, announce that
the course of events in connection with our interests
in Fiji makes it desirable that the business of this
co. [Fiji and N.Z.] be again vested in the Aus-
tralian co., and your Board has, therefore, eome
the conclusion that steps should be taken forthwith
for the liquidation of the co., which can be effected
without delay, as short-dated investments now heldl are
sufficient to pay the present capital and intei est
thereon to date of payment.
The subsidiary’s earnings have been very lus-
cious ; and after only seven years it has,
besides paying divs., accumulated surplus
liquid assets ample to repay an amount ex-
ceeding the 3J millions of bonus pref. capi-
tal with which it began, and then pass
back a going enterprise to its former
owner. In effect, to old holders the £ for
£ bonus issue of 1915 has turned out a cash
bonus, on which interest has been paid
regularly for seven years, and which also
carried an extra prize when the first half of
the issue was returned. The terms of re-
payment of the £1,650,000 of prefs. now in
the Maoriland concern have not been dis-
closed, but going back just over 15 years,
and regarding tbe activities of the. pup as
the doings of its parent, the following capi-
tal movements show how the C.S.R. has fat-
tened its proprietors: —
1907 Paid capital .. •• •• ' •
1907 New cash-paid capital . • • • 225,000
1907 Bonus issue .. .. £75,000
1908 „ 350,000
1910 „ 150,000
1913 „ 250,000
” ” 825,000
£3,250,000
1915 M.L. and Fiji bonus issue .. 3,250,000
Of the total £4,300,000 increase of capital in
that period £4,075,000 was bonus scrip. In
1920 the parent returned £650,000 of its
capital; last year the subsidiary returned
£1,625,000, plus £203,125 bonus, and now
£1,625,000 is to be paid back. So the very
clever reshuffling of the past seven years has
enabled £4,103.125 cold cash to be returned,
which is £1,678,125 more than the total cash-
paid capital in the business.

Sydney Open Exchange so far has not
been a marked success, some morning “calls”
having been abandoned* owing to the non-
attendance of “brokers and dealers.” To
attribute the slackness of business to the
absence of “brokers” is absurd; hitherto it
has been understood that an “open exchange”
is a place where a broker, as such, is sup-
posed to be conspicuous by his absence,
and where any person can buy or sell
shares on paying certain commissions
and complying with conditions _as to
acceptance or delivery of scrip. If
there were any legitimate business in the
smaller mining stocks the Open Exchange
might command a large part of it, because
it has departed from the one-sided rule (for
the broker) that on such shares there must
be buying and selling commissions. On all
deals this Exchange levies commission only
from the seller.
Since February, 1919. the Gold Producers’
Association has sold gold with a mint value
exceeding 141 millions, and given mine-
owners millions of premium thereon. For
the past six months the premium had de-
clined to 4s. lOd. per standard ounce, but
on 428,7200 z. that meant £104,251 for pro-
ducers.
Silver mining in the Apollyon Valley, 18
miles from Broken Hill and .fight from
Silverton, was active seven years before the
great Broken Hill line was discovered in
1883, and the smelters at Day Dream for a
time were winning 12,0000 z. per week. Some
of fire shows were worked down to about
100 ft., but most were abandoned when un-
altered sulphides, then of no commercial
value, were met at around water level. Since
then the mines have been idle, though odd
parcels have been picked from the old dumps
giving up to 390 z. silver and 65 p.c. lead
per ton. A Broken Hill crowd, headed by
Eustace Lowry, is now forming a little co.
to take over the New Year, Gemini, Gem,
Dorothy and Richard Ruby leases. An
interesting prospectus gives old records and
reports, but makes no extravagant claims;
the syndicate which now holds the leases
merely “believes that there is sufficient justi-
fication for re-opening the richer mines” and
“hopes” for the existence of supplies of' sul-
phide ore rich in silver. The Anollyon
Amalgamated is to be in 1000 shares of ilO
each. The syndicate takes 250 fullv-pa-ds,
but no cash, 250 are held in reserve, and 500,
to be paid to £4 on allotment and witn calls
up to £1 per month, are offered the public.
The first move will be to instal plant
to unwater workings and then examine
them. No big lode has been proved
in the valley: values are in veins varying
from a few inches to 4ft., but they have
always been undependable in both longitu-
dinal and vertical extent. However, they
were often very rich: patches went several
hundred ounces to the ton, and in one
instance 12cwt. gave 25750 z. silver. The
late C. S. Wilkinson held out hopes that
some of the lodes —those which appeared to
have been formed along an original joint in
the strata —would continue to “great depths.
With modern treatment methods available to
handle sulphides, Apollyon Amalgamated may
have luck by following down some of the
narrow lodes. # *
Operations will be resumed at Freney’s
Mt. Wynne bore at the end of this month.
There have been several deluges in the Rim-
berlevs recently, but boring should soon be
in full swing on both Freney’s and Okes-
Durack areas.
Retaliation Reward and Retaliation Junc-
tion (W.A.f have closed down indefinitely.
Good surface values gave out at 40ft. Both
cos. have about Is. per share cash in hand.
Melbourne has had two big disappointments
recently in the North Fingall and the Retali-
ation group.
* * * *
The latest Perth float, Lalla Rookh, is in
120,000 shares of 10s. The purchase con-
sideration is £12,000 cash and 20,000 fully-
paids. The show is near Marble Bar, and
is reported to have 5000 tons of ounce ore m
sight; Workings are down 150 ft., and the
mine is equipped with a 10-head mill and
cyanide plant. The ground is so hard that
rock-drills are to be installed forthwith. If
air-drills effect the economy expected, and
ore reserves are materially added to, _ the
mine will have a chance. At the same time,
that chance appears to be hardlv worth the
£22,000 in cash and shares which the public
is invited to pay for it.
* * * *
The deepest hole on Mutooroo’s leases is
down 22ft., and there the average w dth of
the ore body is 50in. and worth 35dwt.
Such developments are not uncommon in the
West: outside the Golden Mile, the best of a
mine is generally within 100 ft. of the sur-
face. There are exceptions, of course. The
co.’s official reports are becoming more pro-
saic, and that may indicate that the author
is now, like many of the public, wondering
what all the fuss was about.
The Grand Junction, adjoining the Oswald,
Maldon (Vic.), has not been worked for 30
years; its famous neighbor has operated con-
tinuously for about 04 years and contributed
34G,0000z. to the State’s gold yield. There
are three reefs in the Oswald : the Main reef
has been worked to 1650 ft., and two spur reefs
down to 800 ft. Owing to a roll, the existence
of these spur reefs was not expected in deeper
ground, but 18 months ago the western reef
was located between SOO and 900 feet, and it
has been proved for 300 ft. to be 10ft. wide
and to carry “good payable values.” Oswald
manager W. J. Rickard declares that the find
has given his old show a new lease of life.
The discovery has also revived interest in the
Grand Junction. Rickard testifies that there
is no doubt that Oswald reefs traverse that
lease; W. M. Cundy regards its abandonment
as “unaccountable,” and enthuses that “it
would be difficult to find a more promising
gold-mining area anywhere in the State.” Of
course, the old hands lost a lot of metal under
their primitive methods of roasting the ore
and merely crushing it, as much as sdwt. dis-
appearing. With modern concentrating
appliances and cyanide, at Oswald’s nowa-
days only 6 to 8 gr. go into the sands.
The Grand Junction leases are held by the
North Oswald Co., and it takes a fifth in-
terest in the proposed 40,000 10s.-share float
and offers the whole of the machinery and
plant on the show for £1250 cash —£500 at
registration and the balance in monthly in-
stalments of £lOO. The North has spent
£l6OO on unwatering and re-timbering the
old 1020 ft. shaft down to 335 ft. and on
plant. The public is offered 32,000 shares
at Is. down and a programme of monthly
calls not to exceed 3d. per share. Reefs
4ft. wide going from 6dwt. to 7dwt. have
been viewed in the 225 ft. and 330 ft. levels,
and values around half-an-ounce in stones
above 225 ft. With 250 ft. of backs readyr
made, and Oswald experience as a guide, it
is proposed to begin operations in this sec-
tion as soon as funds are available.. All
the ground between 300 ft. and 700 ft. is un-
prospected, so there are possibilities. And,
in the light of happenings next-door, there
are more than stray chances elsewhere in
a resurrected Grand Junction.
New Blue, Bendigo, won 6890 z. from 630
tons last week and another Is. div. was
declared. Since the beginning of the year 4s.
(£9000) has been distributed. The critics
who, a little more than a year ago, pro-
claimed the show a swindle and backed their
opinion by spec-soiling the shares by thou-
sands at from 10s. to 15s. must be feeling
pretty blue. That some of them have not
yet retrieved themselves is shown by the
disparity between the ouoted prices of con-
tributing and paid-up shares. Recent develop-
ments have added largely to ore reserves, and
have also much improved the outlook for
South Blue.

Al, Gaffney’s Creek (Vic.), is back on the
call list. No one.minds except the racing
crowd who have made the mine their own.
Two years ago Till was turning out fat profits
from the floors at No. 5 level, paying divs.,
and adding to plant. Meanwhile, the office
piled up a £lO,OOO reserve, and in March last
distributed a 2s. 6d. div. Since then levels
7 and 8 have been duffers. With the £lO,OOO
gone and calls ahead, the bookies learn the
old lesson that Victoria’s mountain mines
are non-stayer?.

Bux, offshoot of Badak, tells the results
of R. M. Boyd’s two years’ prospecting in
Borneo. They are the acquisition of pros-
pecting riglitsi for three years over 40,000
acres on the Patocran river, with a right
to tw* years’ extension. If everything works
out well, the next problem will be to secure
a firm hold of the usual 75 years’ lease.
Boyd says this can be got at any time,
thereby casting aside the general belief that it
is unsafe to sink capital in any Dutch colony
because of insecurity of tenure. As to his
work Boyd says that he started after gold,
but neglected that mission because he located
oil and gas. He collected and corked a
small sample of oil and satisfied himself that
his blocks carry “a perfect anticlinal arch.
The full text of a very guarded assay report
by the Vic. Department of Mines is tendered
in support, and Boyd frankly recommends
that a tip-top geologist shall be sent to con-
firm his deductions.

The improved tin market has revived inter-
est in Federation tin, Heemskirk (Tas.).
Many shareholders forfeited when the out-
look‘was blue, and the directors were com-
pelled to suspend their ambitious programme.
They now consider prospects good enough to
set about securing funds necessary to com-
plete equipment and commence production.
A GO-head battery was purchased from the
Tasmania Gold Mines and is now at Beacons-
field awaiting transport. The directors are
offering 50.000 reserve and forfeited shares,
to be paid to 10s. by the end of September,
and, as a tempting bait, will issue £1 scrip
paid to 10s., the amount at present called
up on the live contribs. Loftus Hills and
J. B. Lewis two years ago agreed that proved
and probable ore amounted to about half-a-
million tons going 1 p.c., and Lewies
development work since has indicated GOO.UOU
tons more in the main lode, and the prospect
of supplies in the Big Trench workings
which alone will “keep the battery going for
vears.” Crushing 144,000 tons p.a., going
1 p.c. oxide, would give 1008 tons metallic
tin and on Lewis’s figurings of costs a work-
ing profit of £09120 is estimated wffh tin
at £lOO Ooudopl; at £lBO. £89.280; and
at £2OO £109,440. As the market is now
around £lB5 and shows signs of steadiness,
Federation prospects have improved. Ihe co.
has no dead horses to shift with the new
funds it is seeking; at October 31 it owed
only £1486.

Queensland gold yield for January jumped
to 47990 z. worth £20,384, compared with
4480 z. for January, 1921. The healthty fea-
ture was an increase of 13290 z. apart fiom
the Mt. Morgan return (30320 Z.). ML
Coolon field weighed in with 3420 z.. the bulk
of it from the Mt. Coolon mine. Normanby
did not contribute, but there should be a
return for February.

With Clark’s dwindling, and nothing else
turning up as a result of small prospecting
efforts, Charters Towers (Q.) is hard put to
it to keep up the appearance of a mining-
centre. Apparently as a last resort, some
boring is to be done on likely sites, and a
local committee is going into the matter.
Chances favor drilling on the dip of the
North Australia or the Rainbow, but wdnle
these have been decent reefs they fade into
mist compared with the old Day Dawn oi
the Brilliant. The North Aus. ran from
1871 (it was Mossman’s first discovery) to
1900 or thereabouts, and has been worked
down to 1000 ft. It was rich, but never very
big. The Eastward Ho got one of the best
single crushings of the field from the Rain-
bow line—B3B9oz. from 1741 tons.

The installation of the 10-hd. battery and
concentrating and cyanide plant having
mopped up most of its funds, the Billy
Hughes, Normanby (N.Q.), recently offered
50 000 new shares of 55., with pref. r ig' lts a f
to’divs. to the extent of the amount called
VIP , and then ranking equally with ordinaries,
though retaining pref. rights over assets. So
far shareholders have responded with appli-
cation for 20,000 of these shares. This will
put new life into the concern, which from
now on will have battery returns to
assist development activities. For a
start the directors want £lOOO to open up
the Frederick. The mainshaft is down 75ft.
and ore has been proved for 50ft. in the 50tt.
level. A winze is going down from that level
to connect with the crosscut from the bottom
of the shaft, which is in a 4dwt. formation,
but has so far not hit the lode. Manager
Walter Colley says the reef is opening up
well in the winze; 7ft. down it is 2|-ft. wide
showing 2*oz. values. This work is expected
to open up a good block of ore for batteiy
feed, besides which there is material above
50ft. to be dug out. With funds from the
new shares and from gold returns, Colley
will push ahead testing deeper ground. Gov-
ernment Geologist Morton is going to have
another look, and will decide whether the
co.’s application for a £5OO subsidy is war-
ranted.

The Sardine, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.), has
been living well up to its tin winnings. Dur-
ing the six months ended December 16 a net
profit of £1719 was earned, but £6OOO had
been paid in divs. and the accounts closed
with P. and L. £2723 in debit. Also there
was only £632 of stock, stores and book
debts to set against a bank overdraft of
£914 and £268 owing otherwise. That was
a verv weak position to have drifted into
after paying 13 divs. The drought was to
blame: there was ample water at the mill,
but no feed for the horse-teams Crushing
was suspended in October, and all hands
were nut on to development. The dry spell
has since passed, and lately 100 tons were
put through for 25 tons tin. Immediate pros-
pects are good, owing to improved tin prices
and plentiful ore supplies. In the footwall
formation at No. 3 level a shoot 16ft. long
and 2ft. wide, and going 25 P-c. tin, has
been proved. The continuation of this body
is being sought in No. 4, ' lll l d , m ; ll J^ gin
director John Lennox is hopeful that he will
soon have 290 ft. of backs for stoping.
The Shrimp, Kangaroo Hills (Q.), has
lust crushed 205 tons for 3 tons of concen-
trates from the No. 4 open-cut. This pans
out at about 30s. per ton, and is below the
estimate of 2 p.c. metal. The No. 1 , le
crosscut is showing kaolin with good tin
prospects. A foot of good ore is showing
in the No. 2 shaft on the bottom lode, and
the next crushing will get the benefit of it.
The returns from this mine are likely to be
verv variable unless a system of averaging
is adopted: the bulk of the ore is very
low-grade, but it is interspersed with some
really rich veinstuff.

“Horton”: If there was anything good to
be found in the way of liquid or solid refresh-
ment you could rely on the Digger to ferret it
out of the most unpromising places. I
remember a certain rail journey in France
during which we were delayed outside a
ruined village owing to a mishap to our
TIME AND THE TAXI-METER WAIT FOR
NO MAN.
GIRLIE (to suitor for her hand) : “You must really give.
me time, Gussie, to think over your offer."
GUSSIE : “ Really , you'll — er—have to hurry. I've got a
taxi waiting for me outside,”
engine. As not one brick remained standing
upon another in the shell-crumpled hamlet,
the prospect did not seem inviting, so the
blanket-covered occupants of my carriage
voted unanimously for the continuance of
bridge. Nevertheless, there was a pretty
general exodus of souvenir-hunting khaki
towards the scene of devastation. “Wonder
what the —— they think they’ll find over
there?” growled my partner, the Major, as he
abstractedly trumped my ace. In response
to the warning “all clear” shriek from our
engine some hours later the bowels of the
fire-scorched earth disgorged a stream of
more or less intoxicated Diggers. The
Major’s faithful batman was the first to
wobble to the train. Struggling on to the
footboard, he thrust a dixie-laden arm
through the open doorway of our carriage.
“Here vou are, sir. We made a pretty
clean sweep of the cellar, but I managed to
save you a dixieful,” he gasped, addressing
the Major; “it’s some green stuff or other,
but it ain’t ’alf bad.” It was the best creme
de menthe I have ever tasted.
* * * *
“The Deacon”: Mention of Bishop Leni-
han, of Maoriland, in a recent Bulletin
reminds me of the yarn he told me the night
he died. It was up in Whangarei (M.L.),
and an old retainer of his had just called to
pay her respects. Some few years back she
had decided to abandon her job and marry
the old chap who pottered around the gar-
den, but who was a “yaller Prodestan’.” The
Bish. volunteered to perform the ceremony.
Now, the R.C.’s have an unswerving rule that
any offspring of a mixed marriage must be
brought up in the faith; but Lenihan, seeing
that the respective ages of the parties were
75 and 77, decided to waive that little point.
Old Maria wasn’t leaving anything to chance,
though. “Sure, your Lordship, ’ said she,
“there’s no telling what these Prodestan
divils may do !”
m • # *
“Tin Hat”: Recent Bulletin pars, re the
sensations and behavior of patients under
anaesthetics recall my one and only meeting
with Royalty. In 1916 Queen Mary visited
the London hospital in which 1 was a patient
and, with her retinue of officials, stopped at
my bedside for a chat. I was just congratu-
lating myself on the hit I was making with
the distinguished visitor, when a Digger in
the next bed, who had been brought, back
from the operating theatre a few minutes
before, commenced to celebrate his return to
consciousness by breaking into that unrefined
ballad, “Mademoiselle from Armentieres.
Presently he stopped, and, having apparently
grasped the situation, requested me, in a
stage whisper, to. tell him “which is her.
Getting no reply, he raised his whisper
another horsepower and offered to bet me a
quid that “Mary was the one in the funny
hat.” Here the procession moved on, while
a sister gagged the offender with a glass of
sodawater.
“Azrim”: My entry for the Malaprop
Stakes is the Mrs. Noovoo Piute who, dis-
cussing the little feed that followed some
sassiety function at . Haw-hawthorn,
observed: “Oh, quaite ordinary, my dear.
Just a glass of fizz and some faux pas sand-
wiches.”
“D.F.”: Historical research
has practical value sometimes.
Ever since it was formed, over
50 years ago, the municipal
council of Richmond (Tas.)
has been paying rent to the
State Government for the an-
cient building used as council
chambers. Now someone has
dug out of a mass of old papers
one which purports to show
that the Imperial Government
paid for the erection of the
place, originally a courthouse
and lockup, 98 years ago, and
later made it over for the free
use and benefit of the people of
Richmond. The council reckons
that it is time it ceased paying
rent to the State, but may be
generous enough not to ask for
a refund.
“S te 11 sby” : Melbourne’s
“straw” bail-bond fraternity re-
ceived a rude shock the other
day when Judge Woinarski
gave a. woman twelve months
for getting herself accepted as
a security under false pretences.
It appears that she went bail
for a gaolbird, representing her-
self as the owner of property
galore, whereas all she owned
she carried in her boots. But
the bail-system is a rotten one
altogether—it sends people to
gaol, not only for not being
affluent themselves, but also for
not having affluent friends.
Nine times out of ten the surety
is fixed far too high (I’m not
speaking, of course, of police-
station bail) ; prima facie the
accused, against whom nothing
has been proved, should be en-
titled to his liberty, and the
onus should be on the police of showirg
cause why any bail at all should be de-
manded.
* * * *
“Dr. Nil”: “The Deacon” tells (B.
8/2/’23) of a man with neither voice nor
ear (in the musical sense) who nevertheless
sings harmonious snatches in his sleep. I
readily accept the statement. My own
father, Dr. J. Clement “Nil,” member of
several scientific societies in Aberdeen and
London in his time, used to sing in his sleep.
My mother heard him, naturally. Sometimes
she used to tell me, because I was, so the
family thought, “musically inclined” myself.
I can remember being summoned into my
father’s bedroom and finding him, fast
asleep, singing in a high voice a wordless
bravura serenade —singing, too, pure fal-
setto, which he never used in his waking
moments, being an untaught amateur with
a pleasant natural mezsotenore voice. That
queer dream-voice and his wildly original
dream-tunes stick in my memory yet,
although I am now older than he was when
I heard them.
STILL CARRIED THE OLD TOPS’LS.
AUNTIE: “But how did you recognise me—you only sate me once,
and that was years ago?"
THE YOUNG 'UN : “Oh, it was quite easy. I've never forgotten
your hat.”
“Pip Tok” : Sometimes the military police
scored off their persecutors. On one occa-
sion a crowd of reinforcements proceeding up
the line greeted an M.P. doing traffic con-
trol with bird-calls, derisive whistles, and
other marks of disrespect. The Jack
attended to his business and kept on calling
“Keep to the right” with monotonous regu-
larity. Even when one ardent spirit yeiled
out, “Oh, you coldfooted , how did you
cop a soft* job like this?” he merely varied
his formula to the extent of replying, “Came
early. Keep to the right.”
“A.T.D.”: A Bulletin yarn by Dowell
O’Reilly—l forget the title—came to life
recently when a Sydney fellow who had ven-
tured to National Park with his young
lady for a day’s outing was returning by
train. Soon after seating himself he felt a
stinging pain in his thigh, and was horror-
struck to find his trousers infested with
ants. He made his way to the lavatory and
began a search for the' invaders. To make
sure none remained, he opened the window
and shook his trousers out; and a passing
train snatched them from him. The young
lady was soon informed of the dreadful fact.
She enlisted help, and upon arrival at Cen-
tral station a hurried hunt for a spare pair
of trousers began—hurried indeed, a.s the
train departed in seven minutes. The
stationmaster came to the rescue with a
tattered pair of overalls, and, presumably,
all ended happily.
* * * *
“Con Drew”: When Stingo met Basher
outside the pub, he opened the floodgates of
his wrath, and the shred of reputation he
left Basher wouldn’t have made a necktie for
a gnat. “And all you do for a living,” he fired
as a parting shot, “is to loaf on women and
drink their wages.” “Do I?” said Basher,
unabashed. “I’ll bet you a quid I don t.”
Stingo pulled a pound from his pocket,
which Basher made haste to- coven Then
suddenly he drew his money back. “Barrin’
the missus, you know,” he stipulated;
“barrin’ the flamin’ missus.”
“Alkaloid”: The suggestions of “X2X”
(B. 8/2/’23) have been anticipated: for
many years pathologists have been working
over Egypt’s mummied relics in the hope
that some indications of ancient disease
might be obtained. Such preparation of
microscopic specimens as has been found
possible suggests that the Pharaohs and theT
subjects were aflßcted by some of the ills
which also afflict modern man. Attempts to
culture micro-organisms have, however, as far
as I know, been unsuccessful, so that com-
plete proof of identity between ancient and
modern diseases is difficult; and attempts to
diagnose the past are extremely hazardous.
Bone lesions in very old skeletons have long
been subjects of controversy, but modern
syphilographers incline to . the view that
syphilis is of American origin, and that the
leprosy of the Bible presented few of the
clinical features of the modern scourge of
mankind.
“Digger’s Batman”: Apropos Thomas
Rountree, of Sydney, the cork-legged ex-
Digger who chased a
garotter the other day,
caught him and
handed him over to
the police, there are
scores of returned sol-
diers who get about
with artificial legs
that seem nowise in-
ferior to the natural
article. To this writ-
er’s knowledge seven
play regularly i n
cricket competitions,
and two go in for
sailing. (One of
these, taking no
chances, leaves his
artificial attachment
in the boat-shed when
starting out on the
water.) In spite of
these testimonials,
however, a number of
“stumpies” still prefer
the old-fashione d
a n d uncomfortable
crutches. Some of
them are working
upon public sympathy
for alms, and leave'
anything that will
minimise their dis-
ablement for after-
business hours; others
have been too impa-
tient to overcome the
irritation which is in-
separable from the
use of artificial legs
when first worn. Of
course, there are cases
in which, owing to the
place of amputation,
the discomfort is
almost impossible to
overcome; and
many a man, rather
than advertise his
affliction, wears his
mechanism in public, only to throw it off
with a sigh of relief when he gets indoors.
“Speculum”: “Cowan’s” “New Zealand
Wars” (B. l/2/’23) does comparative jus-
tice to the Maori fighting men. But the
peculiar genius of the Maoris lay not so
much in their bravery and organisation as
in their use of fortifications. T’bhaka’s Zulu
impis were composed of men as brave as the
Maoris; certainly more ferocious and pro-
bably better organised. But, like other Afri-
can/South American and Asiatic people the
Zulus only built palisades and the like to
protect their homes. It remained for the
Maoris—unique in this respect amongst
native warriors—to build earthworks to hold
up an enemy’s advance or equalise the odds
of battle. A Maori pah was frequently one
of a series of field works built to cover the
THE TYRANNY OF TEARS.
“Oh, well, cheer up — it's always better to
laugh than cry."
“You just wait until you try to manage a
husband.”
retreat of a tribe whose military operations
were calculated to lure the enemy on to un-
favorable ground. When the Maoris adopt
firearms—the two-barrelled fowling-piece, or
tupara, for choice—they invented the covered
trench and rifle-pit, and built fortifications
honeycombed by galleries and strengthened
with tree-trunks and supple-jacks that were
worthy of the best modern military engineers,
and about as easy to clear as rabbit-warrens.

IMPORTED FOOTMEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Required, for Government House, Melbourne, a
thoroughly experienced Under Butler, also First and
Second Footman, height sft. lOin. to 6ft., an agree-
ment of two years; wages to commence when en-
gaged ; must be thoroughly experienced men <>t
good references and with war services ; to sail about the
25th January; good wages offered; personal appli-
cations preferred, but if by letter state full particu-
lars, and enclose recent photograph to the Stewai-ds’
Agency, 3 Derby-street, Mayfair, London, W.
—London Times, 29/12/’22.
Wanted, a brace of Jeameses. Five foot ten
To six foot nought they must in stature be,
And match like carriage nags—or cornermen —
Or like each pair of calves for symmetry.
Another requisite ’s a butler. Then
A harassed Ex. can rub his hands in glee
And see ahead a time “all beer and skittles”
When he’s dispensing or assaulting victuals.
Prime Ministers and Bishops we can grow,
Judges (home-made from Buzfuzes to Phunkeys) ;
We’ve even Generals who’ve made some show
On battlefields. But, when it comes to flunkeys,
To seek ’em here were futile as to go
And scour the inaliee for giraffes and monkeys.
A clime so free can hardly be congenial
To cultivation of the liveried menial.
Mayfair for De La Pluches. There are scores
Of chaps who’re used for Earls to under-buttle,
Of powdered coves whose forte is opening doors
Or striding hearthwards with a copper scuttle
Of coal. But when they reach these sunlit shores
God send that none suggest connexion subtle
Between three gorgeous, non-martial batmfen
And six imported-under-contract hat-men.

“T. 0.1.” goes astern on the Time Machine :
The S.W. corner of Hunter and Castlereagh streets,
Sydney, where stand Royal Chambers that have ]ust
changed hands for £BO,OOO, was a leasehold held by
William Robex-ts in the days when N. S. Wales was
young. Roberts kept the King’s Arms, a tavern of
the pre-Macquarie era, and the license was held :n
the family until 1836. When the ancient pub was
demolished the corner was used by Gilchrist, Watt
and Co. and others for storing boilers and machinery.
In 1883 Tattersall’s Buildings were erected, Hawkes
and Co. having horse saleyards at the rear, although
no stage coaches ever started from there. At one
time the property was owned by James Norton,
M.L.C., but some years ago it became part of the
estate of Captain Charles Smith, out of whose family
it has just passed. In the triangular space opposite
stood parson Johnson’s “wattle-and-dab” church of
the 1790’5.
* * * *
“Catamain”: A few years ago The Bul-
letin published a paragraph written from a
military hospital in England, telling of the
pluckv but seemingly hopeless fight for life
which an Australian soldier named Rountree
was putting up against an attack of double
pneumonia, complicated by the amputation of
both legs for trench-feet, and nostalgia.
That’s the man who was warmly commended
at the recent Darlinghurst sessions for his
action in chasing on cork legs, and capturing,
a street thief who had assaulted two of his
mates.
* * * *
“Azrim”: Re “X2X” and the increase of
modern medical knowledge from the exhuma-
tion of mummies, the late Sir A. Ruffer,
when Professor of Bacteriology at the Uni.
of Alexandria, did brilliant research work
in this direction. He invented methods of
softening the mummy’s adamantine tissues
so that thin slices could be cut, stained with
haematoxylin and eosin and mounted in the
usual fashion for microscopic examination.
In this way proof was furnished that the
Gyppo of 1500 b.c., or thereabouts, suffered
from pneumonia, tubercle, cirrhosis of the
liver, atheroma and bilharzia. There is no
record of Ruffer culturing micro-organisms
from the mummified bodies; preservatives
used by the embalmers for the abdominal
viscera would inevitably kill any pathogenic
bacteria present. The professor was unable
to find any evidence whatsoever of syphilis,
although a special look-out was kept for the
ravages of S. pallida, especially in osseous
lesions and the coats of large arteries such
as the aorta; so that if the leprosy men-
tioned in the Bible was really a syphilitic
infection the Chosen didn’t contract the dis-
ease during their soiourn by the Nile.
* * * »
“Harold Ilardupp”: Sydney’s paper sellers
are a mixed lot. One of them, who takes a
week-end part in this branch of industry, is
an ex-lecturer in an Australian University,
where his advanced views brought him into
collision with the Senate. He has become a
cheerful, if somewhat ragged, Bohemian, who
believes, or affects to, that, man’s wants be-
ing really very few, the energy employed in
making money to secure non-essentials is
wasteful folly. Contented with a sufficiency
to eat. and drink and a place wherein to
sleep, he smiles pityingly upon a hurrying
world, and only detains it long enough to sell
it an occasional “spesh’l ’dish’n.”
* . * * *
“Digger’s Batman” gives his testimony:—
Either “Centurion” (B. 15/2/’23) is wrong-, or
some men in the A.I.F. were champion bluffers. I
personally met several of the King’s Corporals who
lie says did not exist. The chief privilege which
they claimed, and which was freely conceded to
them, seemed to be to get drunk —or, rather, remain
drunk indeterminately—without boii-g- called to
account. One man I knew personally served in the
S’African war, and went subsequently to England.
Among the first, of the A.I.F. to be invalided to Eng-
land in the late war, he was one of a number of
men inspected by the King, who recognised him as an
old acquaintance, and conferred on him the rank
“Centurion” scoffs at. Re-enlisting after return
to Australia, he claimed, and x-eceived, recognition
immediately as a Corporal. Another K.C. was the
worst nuisance of the Lark Hill Camp in England.
In N.S.W. he would have been locked up as an habi-
tual inebriate; in the ti-aining depfit, being per-
manently too sozzled for any duty, he just wandered
around like a stray dog. The general understanding
was that, because he was a King’s Corporal, nothing
could happen to him.
* * * *
“Lexite”: The divorce harvest from the
matrimonial crop that followed the repatria-
tion of the Diggers has commenced. There
are some complicated puzzles in the cases
awaiting hearing. One woman married a
Digger who was about to leave England for
Australia, and thereby secured a gratis pas-
sage to this land
of the free. The
alleged “husband,”
however, declares
that there was no
marriage and
couldn’t be, seeing
that he had a wife
of his own in Aus-
tralia ; he merely
went through the
ceremony, goo d-
naturedly, to oblige
a lady who would
otherwise have had
to pay her full
steamer fare. Any-
way, on the way
out, she met an-
other homing war-
rior, and married
him when she
arrived. Later, a
Tommy ex-soldier,
arriving as an
immigrant, encount-
ered the accommo-
dating dame, and
claimed her as the
wife to whom he
had been united as
long ago as 1913.
This is a sample
of some of the
tangled knots
which Judge Owen
is to be asked to
unravel — Judge
Gordon, in terror . ... , ., .
perhaps of what is coming, has quitted that
jurisdiction.
“F.A.”: Further to “Kip” on naval
quips (B. 8/2/’23). sitting down to the
loyal toast holds good only on board ship.
In naval barracks,
etc., the toast js
absorbed perpendi-
cularly. For a
mess of officers to
endeavor to stand
to drink the King’s
health on a de-
stroyer or light
cruiser in a sea
way would end in
a disaster to de-
corum. Again, on
some of the o't-
time fighting craft,
the deck-head of
the ward-room did
not permit of any-
one opening out to
full length. The
Saturday night
toast of “Sweet-
hearts and Wives”
is not peculiar to
the Nav y. At
every military
mess of the Im-
perial forces this
toast is duly hon-
ored. In some
A.I.F. messes it
was drunk, but
with less serious-
ness, and generally
some cheeky sub.
would add the ex-
pected “May thejr
never mee t.”
Saluting the quar-
ter-deck is another
naval quip of long-
standing. Before
the Armada days
all persons coming
abaft the main
mast were required
to salute the part
of the ship re-
served for senior
officers. All offi-
cers on the quar-
ter-deck return the
salute, and not
only the senior
man present ‘ „„„
as is the case elsewhere. If no officers aie
present the visitor’s tribute goes unrecog-
nised.
“Randolph Rentless” : An ancient reprobate
who is spending the evening of his days in a
home gave me some details about an occu-
pation I never heard of before. Finding I
was more interested than shocked at some
of his reminiscences, he became confidential.
“I was a ‘getter-drunk’ at one time,” he
confided. “When the blokes I worked for
wanted to crack a joint they filled me up
with beer, and I went and abused the cop
who was doing the beat. While he was
away taking me to the lock-up they d put
their job through. But I overdid it one
night—cracked a John with a be a r bottle
and went in for twelve rnunce. That was
the last time I worked as a getter-drunk.”
THE RUDENESS OF THESE FATHERS.
“What the devil do you mean by this, you young scoundrel?”
“Oh, father, how can you say such things to Cecil? I haven't
even introduced him to you yet!”
“Sorry?” I suggested. “My oath,” he
affirmed regretfully; see, the blokes I
worked for were in clink themselves when I
come out, so I lost the easiest job I ever
had!”
MAKING A CHRISTMAS OF IT.
“I refused Jimmy three weeks ago, and he has keen drinking ever
since."
“Oh, I can’t put up with these men who don’t know when to stop
celebrating.”
“Henry Horsecollar”: These unpleasant
vendetta people who shoot all over Mel-
bourne and don’t kill each other half so dead
as they should, have been at it again. The
police say they can do nothing, and in a
legal sense they can’t, for the victim flatly
and invariably refuses to supply informa-
tion, he being a pushite himself, and like-
wise in the shooting industry, and informa-
tion being contrary to the rules of the game.
Yet I know a way by which the case could
be met. If I were boss legislator in these
parts I would enact that the injured but
silent person should start doing six months
as soon as he was out of the gaol hospital.
The formal charge might be keeping the bar
door open after hours, simony, or refusal
to take the oath of allegiance—l don’t care
in the least which. When the infuriated
eonfinee came out he would probably shoot
the man who shot him, and my law would
rope that man in—for barratry and infringe-
ment of copyright. This method would get
the gunmen one by one even more surely
than if they informed on each other, for
there would’ be no miscarriages of justice.
It might get them out of their turn, but that
wouldn’t signify.
MY WEEK-ENDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I spend my week-ends here and there,
I go by boat or train;
I never worry re the fare
Or whether it will rain.
I lead a very busy life,
Some leisure’s due to me;
I never have to take the wife —
She isn’t keen, you see.
In summer-time I often go
To places on the coast
Where I can get a healthy “blow,”
A drink, or tea and toast.
As pleasantly, my Saturday
Is spent at junxble sales
Where I buy carpets, rugs or (say)
Sheet-iron, nuts and nails.
I make my way, by car or boot,
Where houses are for sale ;
Note down the land, the price per foot,
The fare by boat or rail.
I check the size of every place
And make out quite a plan—
The yard, the grounds, the rooms, the space,
Just like a business-man.
Last week I bought some blood-stock, and
This week maybe I’ll go
And have a look at grazing land.
A dairy-herd or so,
An orchard or a river front,
Perhaps a poultry-run
May send me ..but upon the hunt
Before next week’s begun.
I never feel as if I’d bid
Too much, at hammer-fall;
I never sigh to think a quid
Has gone beyond recall.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY THEN.
MAMMA: “You can’t he too discreet. I
shouldn’t have let him kiss me if I had
been you!”
GWEN : “If you’d been me he mightn’t have
wanted to.”
The fares they charge me on my trips
Ne’er leave me short or broke;
The men I tip on trains and ships
Vote me a decent bloke.
’Tis easy when the way you know,
A simple thing it is ;
My week-end jaunts require no dough—
No dough my week-end biz.
Twopence is all the cash I need
To go where I’m inclined;
It buys the paper that I read
To find where I shall next proceed
Week-ending—in my mind.

Thirty-three years ago on Feb. 14 the
lirst Australian Federation Conference in
Melbourne broke up. Duncan Gillies, Vic
Premier, presided. The three still-lively sur-
of t h r e 13 delegates are William
McMillan (Ma State), Dr. John Cockburn
(S. Aus.), and Stafford Bird (Speck). Bird
l s r I 1.! Ids 84th year, and Cockburn and
McMillan are in their 73rd.
Augustine M. Betts, of Goulburn
(A.S.W.), is now the oldest practising
solicitor in the State. He was born in
1 arramatta in 1844. his mother being a
daughter of parson Marsden, was articled to
Charles H. Walsh, of Goulburn, father of
tlie Parliamentary Librarian, and after five
years came to Sydney and finished with
Thomas Iceton. Betts was admitted in
J. A. McKENZIE, Hobart’s new Mayor.
1866, practised in Wagga for a while, then
bought Walsh’s practice, and has been
anchored in (foul burn ever since. Fred
llannon, who has retired from practice, is
his senior in admission by two years.
“Pedro”: Apropos malaprops. John See,
once Premier of N.S.W., was replying lustily
to incriminations and charges. “Don’t be so
bellicose,” interjected one of the objects
of his wrath. “Mr. Speaker,” said See with
a hurt, downward glance at his ample cor-
poration, "I hope, sir, that we may be able
to conduct debates in this House without
these offensive personal reflections.”
Michael Minogue, late ex-Under Treasurer
for Vic., drew his pension for only six
months. His was a hard climb up the pro-
motion ladder. It was only when he left
the Treasury, in disgust, to become account-
ant of the Mines Department, that the finan-
cial office realised that it had had a man
worth £lOOO a year working for a third of
that figure. Snared back to the Treasury, lie
became accountant, and then permanent
head. Minogue prompted Watt to deter-
mine, without compensation, the ancient bar-
gain with the London and Westminster Bank
providing for a penalty of 2s. Gd. p.c. should
stock management be withdrawn from it. A
possible blister of £50,000 was thus peeled
oft. He was the author of the scheme for
financing developmental roads and so utilis-
ing the first three years’ profits of the Tram-
way Board that £850,000 municipal liabili-
ties to the State were wiped out, a million
paid off the State debt, and money freed
for highways to settlements. For 15 years
he was the big brain-cell for seven Govern-
ments, but was never adequately rewarded.
Minogue spent himself in the State’s service,
and was only 60 when the call came.
T. Geo. Ellery, Melbourne Town Clerk, is
in the running for Nesbitt’s Sydney shoes
when they are empty. Crossing to Melbourne
after a period of
town - clerking in
Adelaide, Ellery
brought to his new
job a ceremonious
dignity character-
istically A d e 1-
aidean, and his
native ability and
tact enabled him
to steer the ship
clear of rocks and
satisfy the many,
and often contra-
dictory, wants of
Melbourne’s extra-
ordinary bumbles.
A remarkably well-
read and widely-
informed man,
Ellery dearly
loves roun d e d
peri o d s, but
doesn’t claim to
rival Thos. 11.
Nesbitt, wlio s e
overwhelming lit-
erary style is the
terror of typists
and printers.
N. S. W. Acting-
Premier OAKES.
Out of the £197,800 left by Henry Berry,
the salt merchant, his friend, Vic. Treasurer
McPherson, will rake in a hefty sum to swell
this year’s surplus. The bulk of the pro-
perty, mostly personal, goes to relatives, but
there will be a big distribution among
Methody institutions and charities. The
executors are empowered to make special
provision for Dr. W. H. Fitchett, president
of Methodist Ladies’ College, Kew, when he
retires from active service soon.
The Wilkins who comes to Australia on
a voyage of discovery for the British
Museum, to collect strange flora and fauna,
and investigate adjacent islands with the
eye of a naturalist, is the Captain Wilkins
who was official photographer with the Aus-
sies, and won the reputation of carrying
the coolest head into the danger zone that
the Huns were confronted with. Wilkins
is a 8. Australian by birth, and a cosmo-
politan by preference.. His foot has left its
mark on every continent, he has been on two
Polar expeditions, and came from his first
with an enthusiastic admiration for the
Eskimo as the kindliest, simplest and
(mirabile diclu) cleanest people he had ever
encountered. _He has trapsed America,
Africa and Asia, mostly per boot, for which
means of locomotion he has a sincere regard,
and now he comes south by east to investi-
gate his own home land at the instigation of
people 10,000 miles away.
AH politicians don’t die dog-poor. The estate
of the iate Justice Wade, one-time N.S.W.
Premier, panned out for probate purposes at
£19,646. But Wade was brought up in a
home where penny-saving was diligently
practised.
“The Deacon”: Young Eugene Brauer, son
of a deceased Lewisham (N.S.W.) under-
taker, has been given the command of the
second string of the. Cardinal’s College—the
Rectorship of the R.C. Missionary Seminary
at Springwood (N.S.W.). Battling through
High School and Uni., he made good even
with the exacting Archbish. Kelly. His
immediate predecessor, “Patsy” Cregan, has
found the increasing burden of years and
flesh too trying to carry any longer at Spring-
wood, so he has stepped down from the more
responsible position to a less important but
more lucrative billet, made vacant by the
death of Archdeacon Cassidy, of Newtown
(N.S.W.). Cregan, though an Australian
native —the New England country claims him
—was educated at All Hallows, in the distress-
ful area, and consequently was considered
to have the Heaven-sent Irish seal upon him.
In fact, he had lived down his Australian
origin. Now Australia moves up one with
Brauer. The job, however, will shortly be
shorn of a good deal of its importance by
the institution of colleges in neighboring
States.
“Swansider’s” reflections: —
No doubt about George Pearce’s luck! He has
been a Senator since Federation .arrived, and a Minis-
ter for more than half his term —12+ years out of
a little less than 22. He is the only survivor, since
Fowler and De Largie were turned down in Decem-
ber, of Groperland’s original contribution to the
Commonwealth Parliament. What is more, he is
the lone portfolio-holder among the Bruce-Page com-
bination who sat in Labor Cabinets before Hughes
was Prime Minister, besides being the amazing phe-
nomenon who has held office without a break since
September, 1914. He stayed where he was, when
the outcry was bitterest against his departmental mal-
administration, because he lay down in the shadow
of Hughes’s boots like a faithful spaniel, and Hughes
wouldn’t allow anyone else to kick him. And the
quaint thing about it is that, while Hughes has been
thrown out of the house and the door barred on
him, his erstwhile humble retainer and faithful echo
is still allowed on the premises—and that as repre-
sentative of a State which turned down every
liughesite who offered himself at the general elec-
tions in a sort of dumb fury of resentment at having-
been fooled into putting up with them so long. If
Pearce had to submit himself for re-election in W.A.
just now, nobody would give him a 100 to 1 dance
in the light of the December verdict on his associates.
Yet he remains a Minister!
“Sucre”: How’s this for doing the fair
thing by one’s country? S. McLeary dumped
his carpet-bag in Queensland in 1864. He
went west the other day at the age of 85,
leaving seven sons, four daughters, 62 grand-
children, 45 great-grandchildren, and one
great-great-grandchild.
“Simon’s” versatile sky-pilot:—.
Church of England parson Wm. Corner, of La-
kemba (N.S.W.), is an all-rounder. Son of a
Wesleyan clergyman he went on the land, after
training at Hawkesbury Agricultural College; made
his own yokes, shaped his own bow-irons and broke
in his own team of bullocks. He went to Euclid
for his swear words, and his. cattle would pull like
fiends when lie called ’em “isosceles,” and
“parallelepipedons.” But one harvesting season he
put on a real bullocky and he so blunted their
sensitiveness that ever after the bullocks listened to
Euclid with the same complacency as to the National
Anthem. This, drought, and other things drove
Corner to Sydney, where he became a tram-con-
ductor, aqd, besides revivaling and tabernacling,
took up shorthand, first-aid work and hypnotism, and
qualified as a revenue clerk, electrician and driver.
Leaving the trams he was appointed minister at Kan-
garoo Valley (N.S.W.), where he put the church and
grounds in good, repair with his own hands. But
his erstwhile Nonconformist conscience brought him
trouble among the cockies because he denounced the
“tickle-toe” and the “slippery-dip.” Then he used
to take his fiddle down to the creek at dusk and
lure the snakes to destruction with “Shall . We
Gather at the River?” He had the place about
cleaned out of wrigglers when the; R.C.’s began to
suspect that he was poking borack at St. Patrick.
This put the lid on his unpopularity, and he passed
on.
R. J. Love, sec. of Melbourne Children’s
Hospital, has bagged the 1000-a-year job of
\ ic. Inspector of Charities, created by the
McPherson Act passed in December. ’ Love
was marked down for the post from the
start, but he looks easily the best of 19
app] cants, and doesn’t gain monetarily by
the change.
T Sergeant Pauling, who retired from the
.N.S.W. Foorce the other day after about 50
years’ service, came from Maoriland in 18514
with a crack team of Rugby footballers, and
instead of returning tried on the blue uni-
form, like it, and stayed.
“The Trier”: “Graeme” (B. l/2/’23) is
wrong in saying that parson Walker, of
Bundaberg (Q.), has seven sons, nil of them
Ms.A. of Oxford. His children number
three, and the oldest is about 12. But his
brothers (five, I believe) all hold degrees—
possibly that’s what “Graeme” meant to say.
With the idea of establishing a National
Picture Gallery in Wellington (M.L.),
lately-knighted Harold Beauchamp has
handed the Public Trustee a property worth
between £5OOO and £6OOO. Interest is to
accumulate until there is a capital of
£lO,OOO : and thereafter the earnings are to be
employed in the purchase of good pictures,
irrespective of the nationality or residence
of the artist.
“Jack” Fitzpatrick, N.S.W. Minister for
Mines and Local Government, who was 62
on the 13th, was born at Moama (N.S.W.),
and has plodded many leagues of the Inky
Way—among other things he edited Goui-
burn Argus, and was proprietor of the
Molong Argus and Windsor and Richmond
Gazette. He has published a couple of
books, too —“The Good Old Days of Molong”
and “The Hawkesbury.” The little man has
been in politics since 1895, when he was
elected for Rylstone, and it is estimated that
his Hansakd speeches would stretch from
here to Mars and back again.
“Spatz”: Higgs, of Queensland, who had
his political funeral at the recent Federal
elections, will applaud The Bulletin’s
italics for Fritz Burnell’s spats. For when
Higgs was sent
west at a previous
election it was said
that what princi-
cipally stirred the
Labor burgesses to
put the boot in
(he was in the
Movement then)
was the diaboli-
cally undemocratic
fact that he came
back from Mel-
b o urne wearing
cuffs on his boots.
Surplus clothing
also helped ,T.
Lionel Fegan to

Fegan was reputed

gown.
Artist BERNARD
HALL, of Mel-
bourne National

critical mood.
Elizabeth Morgan, who was transferred
from the list of the living dead to the buried
the other day at the Ararat Lunatic Asylum,
was said to be a sister of the bushranger
who was shot in the ’sixties.
It is 82 years this month since W. B.
Clarke discovered gold near Hartley
(N.S.W.), and 72 years the same month
since Edward Hargraves, the first to find
Australian gold in payable quantities, un-
earthed the yellow stuff at Lewis Ponds.
When Michael Joseph Bannon, ex-chief
of Melbourne detectives, retired from the
service some time ago at 60, he opened up
business as a private investigator, took an
office in the city, and tackled the new job
with all his old zeal. Now he’s asking him-
self what he meant by staying so long in
the service.
“Yow”; Geelong (Vic.) has a Pig Club.
-The president is Mr. Ham. It has been sug-
gested that Ernest Trotter, a resident of the
district, should become secretary.
‘‘Sucre” : Re the passing over of Holyoake
Woodd, the Mount Morgan G. M. Co. ; s old
secretary. When he left Rockhampton it
took him an hour to write out his resigna-
tion of .no fewer than 16 mostly-honorary
jobs chiefly secretaryships of lodges, hos-
pitals and clubs. The veteran’s pension from
Mount Morgan was £3OO a year.
Australia is now a regenerate country that
sends missionaries away to convert the
heathen. Last week three Salvo lassies, all
captains in the Lord’s army, sailed away to
bang the drum in Central China, where
the brigands are thickest, and human life is
probably held cheaper than anywhere else
on the face of the globe. They were Maud
Carmichael, Myrtle Ballinger and Gladys
Lmerton. The first Salvation Army •‘Regi-
mental Chief” in China was a Sydney girl—
Miss Gillam, of Burwood.
The Australian pulpit-pounder is finding a
place in the outside world. In London, two
of the biggest churches are being filled bv
I. \Y. Norwood, late of Adelaide, and W. C.
I oole, of Tasmania. Lionel Fletcher, another
S. Australian, is doing special work for
the English Free Church Council, and in
America O. W. S. McCall, recently of Mel-
bourne, has been making a stir. S. j. Iloban,
well known in Sydney, was a while ago in-
viled to a California church and a thousand
a year, and, on his turning the offer down,
the church has now called C. I. Benson, a
joung preacher of Toorak (Vic.). Incident-
, ally. Benson does a weekly column for Melb.
Hebald
“Lornkey Ree”: When I was doing odd
official jobs at Port Said some years back, I
was asked by Prince D’Arenberg, president of
the Canal Co., to take tea with him at
Ismaiha. We got there per his motor-boat
at a pace that would have landed the Sultan
in gaol for destroying the canal banks. His
welcome was, “I wish to thank Austral a
through you, sir, for its kindness to me when
I visited it. I found Australians as hospi-
table as Australia’s shores are inhospitable.”
I don’t quite know what it meant, but it
sounded as if the old chap had been blown
ashore on a hen-coop somewhere in the lower
reaches of the Yarra. Does anyone know
when and why the Prince came to Australia
and who fed him so liberally? Anyhow, he
remembered us kindly, because his palace
gardens were filled with Australian trees and
shrubs, and he was very proud of them.
THE SUMMER SHOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Colored hats, light dresses and garters below the
knee welcomed the return of summer’s blue sky to
Melbourne to-day.”
A glad, unwonted surburst warmed
The heart of man the other Monday ;
Slim-figured girls, and some full-formed,
Came forth to shock sad Mrs. Grundy ;
In summer garb they lazed along,
Delightful comers and departers—
A joyous, jesting, jaunty throng,
A dream of dresses, hats and garters.
Such days life seems again worth while —
One’s head is turned, as though with drink-
ing,
By Nell’s intoxicating smile
And Minnie’s roving eyes, I’m thinking!
They’re out to .charm both poor and rich ;
They beam on shopboys, clerks, and carters ;
For beauty would all men bewitch,
With lightest dresses, hats and garters.
We bless the.sultry days which bring
The women out in coolest raiment,
Like butterflies upon the wing ;
Eve offers smiles, and Adam payment.
Oh golden hour, Oh chaste tea-time,
When pagans, proud as Christian martyrs,
Protest undying faith sublime
In dresses, colored hats and garters!
Shall costume ever lose its charm
Except for fools who rave of nudeness?
The very thought excites alarm
Of innocence, in Eden crudeness,
Returning to a world where boys
Would all be pasty pure-at-hearters—
No smoke-room yarns, no sinful joys,
No dresses, colored hats or garters !
I love those skirts in pretty tints,
, 0f lightest texture, latest fashion—
Those frocks that whisper vaguest hints
Of woman’s wiles and lover’s passion;
They decorate the human race
For which we all alike are starters —
Sing hey, the tempting form and face,
Allied to dress, and hat, and garters !
VICTORIA.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Morob” : A common belief among those
who have never been in the tropics is that every
native has a complete set of teeth and that a
decayed masticator is rare. As a matter of fact, the
natives of New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago
are no more immune from dental troubles than arc
the people of Sydney or Melbourne, although the
number of those with caries is less. On the other
hand the native frequently suffers from neuralgia.
Three or four years ago a native at Kokopo, near
Rabaul, committed suicide and at the inquiry the
fact was revealed that he had blown out his brains
with his boss’s shot-gun because he had been suffering
with neuralgia for several months; and the autopsy
shewed that the origin of the complaint was of a
dental nature. The bush kanaka suffers less from
his teeth than his town brother. One reason probably
is that of late years the natives around the towns
have abandoned their customary food (which in-
cluded vegetables containing stringy, fibrous matter
that had the effect of a tooth brush) in favor of
tinned meat and salmon, particles of which become
wedged in natural cavities of the teeth and decom-
pose there, so setting up decay.
■if * * *
“Raydium”: We’ve a chap in our district
who is a working foreman, but the directory calls
him a veterinary surgeon. He was passing the
store one evening in his jinker behind a small flock,
and had one jumbuck reposing at his feet. “What,
a casualty, Bill?” asked someone. “No,” says Bill,
“a crossbred.” One day the stock-inspector was
on his rounds and William was displaying a few
lusty vet. instruments and explaining their various
uses, etc. “Have you a diploma, Mr. Blank?” asked
the inspector. “No, them’s all I use,” was the
reply. But Bill’s status as a vet. sank below zero
when he was called to have a look at a gelding that
was down and very much swollen in the barrel. He
walked up to the neddy, which had its back to
him, cocked his head on one side, and, after a
cursory glance, announced with his most profes-
sional air, “She’ll foal inside twelve hours.”
# * * •
“Strenuous”: A few weeks ago a merino
wether was found in the Snowy River (N.S.W.)
bush, carrying a fleece 18 inches long. The wool
was as sound as a bell, and, in spite of his heavy
load, the jumbuck was mud fat. His earmarks showed
him to be a straggler from a mob sent up for grass
in 1916.
* * * *
“Pick”: To convince “Murkah” (B.
4/1/’23) that canine mental heredity in pure-bred
dogs is no myth, let me tell him about Clune,
a Scotch collie bought as a pup in Scotland for
100 guineas, by the late Col. Roberts, part owner
of Bibbenluke station (N.S.W.), and imported to
Sydney in 1882. For some years the aristocrat was
kept by the Colonel as a home pet, but, becoming
a nuisance owing to his pent-up energies, he was
forwarded to the station, where he was given into
the care of a Jincurnbilly boundary-rider. Up fill
that time Clune had never seen a sheep outside a
butcher’s shop, but lie immediately displayed such
natural sagacity in the management of the flocks that
he was the wonder of Monaro sheepmen—and they
know a good dog when they see one. For some
years the Clune stock were the only sheep-dogs recog--
nised by the squatters and drovers of the region, and,
unlike the mongs. of “Murkah’s” knowledge, they
never needed training. But the breed died out
early owing to the unnatural propensity of the
females for devouring their own pups.
* * * *
“A Jocelyn”: They told me strychnine
wouldn’t kill pigs—or crows —and I believed ’em ;
but, even so, being a poor man and unfortunate by
nature, I decided to take no risks. Therefore, before
I commenced to poison my pet rabbits to-day with
apples and strychnine, I drove all the pigs into their
sties. To-night on dishing up their supper, I found
three young ’uns dead, and an old sow very sick.
The mangled remains of a bunny, still warm, told
the tale. Singing “Mother, I Have Come Home to
Die,” he must have vaulted the fence and passed
away before the very snouts of those poor porkers.
Of course, they might have choked to death on the
bones, but I seriously believe that their demise was
caused by the strychnine.

“George Rich”: Early last year the
brothers Baumgarten left Meekatharra (W.A.), and
at Mount Barton station, in the North Kimberleys,
took over 500 head of cattle. Late in December they
reached Karbar station, on the Murchison, with the
mob. The mortality for the 2800-mile trip, over
difficult and often feedless country, was 15. Con-
sidering the territory traversed it was a remarkable
droving feat.
* * * *
“Senojo”: Some time back Abos. talked
of wild animals seeking the protection of humans.
I’ve struck another case. An old wombat, who for
years inhabited a gully in the front of a Victorian
mountain-home, and defied anyone to get near him,
has now found that senility is making him an easy
prey for the foxes and other animals of the hills ;
so, in his adversity, he has sought refuge under
the house. The old chap waddles about the place
and flatly refuses to forsake the protection of
man.
* * * *
“Axeman”: “Toby C.’s” springboard tree-
felling record (B. 25/l/’23) is a dud. Two Thorp-
dale (Vic.) axemen have each beaten it. To lop
a tall bluegum-tree, Tom Beech climbed and bridged
the spaces without limbs on the tree-trunk, using
springboards, until he was 84 ft. up, and then, on
a springboard, he did his lopping. Of course he had
to remain on the board as the top-storey fell.
Beech’s performance was then beaten by Dolph
Tilgner, who springboarded 102 ft. up a green-tree
to rob a bees’-hive. Both these feats were photo-
HE DIDN’T FORGET.
SQUATTER (to darkle, who has just returned from town): “Hey, Brolga! Did you
bring me those stirrups I told you to get at Falconer’s?”
BROLGA : “Ba’al fetchem, boss.”
SQUATTER: “No. you black swine—forgot all about them, I’ll bet.”
BROLGA : “Ba’al forget ’em—just never thought plurry word about ’em.”
'graphed and proofs can be seen in the district.
For 'myself, 1 wouldn't rob a hive 2ft. up, let
alone 102 ft., and that’s out of no consideration
for the bees, either.
* * * *
“Silas”: Somebody pinched Barney’s new
hat while he slept off the load he had put aboard
in, Garter’s bar at Peewee, and replaced it with a
wretched old felt with a blowhole through the roof.
In due course Barney awoke, and, groaning, em-
braced his swollen head. “Struth,” he said to the
barman, “that whisky' of yours gives a bloke a
nawful ’ead!” Here he dragged the unknown tile
off, and, gazing at it, added: “And strike me pink
if it don't give ’im a bad ’at!”
HARD LINES.
ANN : “I’m very disappointed in my new
bathing costume.”
ANETTE: “How is that?”
ANN : “Well, then; guaranteed that it
wouldn’t shrink —and it hasn’t.”
“Colub”: “Iv.’s” story (B. 18/l/’23) of
the infant that was just saved from being swallowed
by a carpet-snake recalls that there is on record
a case in which the child was not rescued. Years
ago the six-months-old offspring of an Italian miner
on the Palmer (Q.) goldfields disappeared from a
cradle at the rear of the hut. No alarm was felt
at first, because it was thought that a girl who was
very attached to it might have called and taken it
for a walk; but when this was found to be not the
case, search was made, and an hour later some of
the searchers found an 18ft. carpet-sanke whose
appearance and sluggish condition so aroused their
suspicions that it was killed and cut open. The
infant’s corpse, in a partly-digested state, was found
inside the reptile. A day or so later the mother
committed suicide, and she was buried in the same
grave as the little one. The headstone bearing the
names of both is still standing.
* * * *
Yarrum” ; Quick thinking in emergency?
A school inspector once got off the track near Glen-
bog (Monaro), and a freezing night was closing in
upon him. He had run out of matches, and it
looked like camping in a swamp, when he spotted
a pig. As Porker made off, the man shook up his
jaded neddy and gave chase. Within a quarter of
an hour the grunter landed him at a farm-house. It
sounds simple, but how many men with nerves on
edge would have thought of it?
* * * *
Saaedi”: “Sir Spen’s” three mopokes
who roosted on the ground (B. 18/l/’23) must
have been dissolute citizens of irregular habits who
couldn t (hie) findsh way home. For mopokes
to doss in that fashion would, in many districts,
be just committing suicide, as foxes would soon
make a meal of the sleepy, ungainly things. Most
ground-roosting birds are wary, alert and fairly
fleet of foot—the curlew, plover and ground-lark
foi instance. One striking exception, however, is
the quail, which is so helpless that, though breeding
very prolifically,- it is yearly diminishing in numbeis.
* * * *
Blue Bar’ : The carrier-pigeons men-
tioned bv Merrigal (B. I'2/ ’23) were slow com-
pared with some, although 55 miles p.h. is a good
speed for a racing homer. In October. 1921 a
bird owned by V. Pursehouse, of Sydney, dew from
Mildura to its home loft and averaged 1960 yards
per minute for the whole 520 miles. This is a long-
distance record. In a 200-mile flight a record
Hnu- P ,ni * has been put up in America,
this is four miles an hour faster than “Merrigal’s”
bird which did 71 miles per hour. Despite what
ilerrigal says the domesticated racing-homer beats
his wild cousins when it comes to long, speedy
flights. Perhaps the scrub bronze-wing “is faster
on the spurts, but over the distance the homer is
on his own.

DOWN A MULGA TRACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If these lines should ever reach you
Where you wander far away,
Would you like to know, old comrade,
What I’m thinking of to-day?
I am thinking of a homestead
And a station hut out back,
And a pair of Arab ponies,
And a mulga-bordered track.
I am thinking of that noontide
In a red midsummer week,
When we passed through Tarrawingee
On our way to Campbell's Creek — .
Tarrawingee once a beehive,
Once an anthill, lying still,
Lifeless in the staring sunshine
On the road to Broken Hill.
Gone was all the noise and movement
That had made it live of old,
Gone its tale of toil and hurry,
Like a story that is told ;
All that man had made and builded,
All his hands had shaped and won,
Bent and reft by wind and weather,
Lay in ruins ’neath the sun.
Song—l think a song of droving
Loved by drovers, sung by you—
Gave the noon once more its splendor
And the skies again their blue ;
Joy once more was round about us,
Joy undimmed by memories,
As we journeyed through the mulga
And the bastard-mallee trees.
REFRESHMENTS PROVIDED.
THE WANDERER: “Well, there’sh something
in living in flats, after all, s’long as you
never go home before the milkman.”
Treasured still as something precious,
Vast of scope and wondrous strange,
Was the vision distance showed us
As we travelled down the range;
Like a grey-green inland ocean
With no white sail on its breast
Lay the saltbush plain beneath us
Stretching ever west and west.
Fronted thus I heard no longer
Lifted song or idle talk;
Only in the cloudless distance
Wheeled a slowly-moving hawk;
Only over leagues of saltbush
Was I given eyes to see
On the far-off western skyline
Mirage-lakes of mystery.
Vast and strange it lay before us,
Bathed in golden noontide light—
Men have died in slum and prison
Dreaming just of such a sight;
Fog around them, gloom about them,
But with soul and mind agleam
Men have seen it, as I saw it —
But to them it was a dream.
Ere at Campbell’s Creek you halted,
In the sunset drawing rein,
We had left the range behind us,
We had travelled miles of plain ;
Viewing splendor, viewing ruin.
We had travelled ridge and rut,
From the homestead on the upland
To the far out-station hut.
N.S.W.

“Jim Carew” : “Te Whare” (B. l/2/’23)
is astray in say'ing the musk-duck can fly during
a good season, when it is usually hog-fat. It
can’t. The rudimentary wings are incapable of
supporting its weight. As a youngster on the South
Coast (N.S.W.), I have chased musk-ducks out of
waterholes and run them down on land. When
pursued, they would run, flapping their wings to
gain more speed, and occasionally leaving the
ground for two or three feet, but never for longer
distances. It was always in a good season that we
ran these ducks down, and those that we took home
weighed between six and eight pounds. Some years
ago, when holidaying at Cobargo, I was out shoot-
ing near a big dried-up swamp some miles behind
the town, and seeing two ducks flying over I fired
both barrels, and brought the pair down. They were
musk-ducks. It was during a prolonged drought, and
one bird weighed exactly two and the other two-and-
a-half pounds. When I shot them they were flying
strongly, about 50 feet from the ground.
“Ned Kelly”: “H.V.E.” (B. l/2/’23)
slips when he says that flathead soon turn white
bellies skyward when the water becomes merely
brackish. I have caught flathead in the upper,
almost fresh-water, reaches of the Narrabeen Lakes
(N.S.W.), and a couple of years back, during a pro-
longed drought, when the upper fresh-water reaches
of the Hawkesbury had become too brackish to
drink, I landed a four-pounder a few miles below
Sackville Reach. He was' a strong, healthy fish,
and was apparently thriving in the brackish fluid.
“Jimmy Possum” : I don’t know much about
the food value of the Moreton Bay fig (B. 28/12/’22),
but I do know that horses in Bananaland, once they get
a taste, are partial to the leaves of the small-leafed
fig. As boys we tried hard to establish these trees
around the homestead, but as soon as they com-
menced to grow cattle and horses ate them down.
To beat the animals, we planted one young tree
in a high hollow stump of a large blue-gum, where
it took root and flourishes to-day. As soon as this
tree commenced to spread the horses attended to
the pruning, and for 25 years now they have kept
the branches trimmed well above their backs.
THE TRIBULATIONS OF COUSIN JOHN.
“Taxi, sir?”
“My Lor', they do; Federal, State and District Council."
“Billy T.” : Jacky Jack, Balder’s black boy
from the wilds of Cootabidgee, had come to Red
Rock, and into mining country for the first time.
His amazement on seeing a live man go down a mine
was great. He remained gazing for some time,
then, imagining he was witnessing a novel kind cf
funeral, he uttered in his wisdom: “Better plurry
quick some feller gettum shobble fillem in.” He
was just as much interested in the old horse trudging
round and round in a whim, then turning and
trudging round again. This provoked him to laugh-
ter, and he informed the braeeman confidentially,
“You know that one yarraman ’im big feller fool—
him nebber get there!”
SMALL END FIRST.
FARMER (with scare-crow horse): “Here, you don’t know nothing. You’ve made it
too small. It won’t go over his head.”
COUNTRY SADDLER: “Over his head? It weren’t made to go over his head. Back him
into it.”
"Tedmulgar”: The phrase about the poten-
tialities for evil there are in a flower-garden has
some meaning. In Victoria St. John’s wort
(Hypericum perforatum) has spread over thousands
of acres of hill country and no one knows where it
will stop. This plant wasn’t brought to Australia
as a pleasant reminder of home by a sentimentalist,
but an old Sairey Gamp included it in her luggage
for much more material if less edifying reasons. There
are several other varieties of Hypericum that should
be watched, particularly 11. calycinum, a rather
handsome flowering variety', grown in many city
gardens, which was spreading around Gisborne and
Macedon till suppressed a year or so ago. Fox-
glove is also on the list of plants liable to become
an evil. On the hill-slopes around Walhalla it has
a good grip and blossoms profusely in early, sum-
mer. It is a highly poisonous plant, the seeds
especially so, and will certainly cause trouble if
cut with hay or silage. Another potential pest is
Watsonia, which has spread on suburban allotments
around Melbourne, and is not likely to be a respecter
of rural lands if it gets the chance.
* * * *
“Artifex”: “Jim Carew’s” sulphur-crested
cockatoo (B. 25/l/’23) is not a bad example of a
homer, but I know of a better one. The boys of
a Roma (Q.) family caught a young black swan and
made a pet of it. They then moved out 36 miles
to Grafton, taking the swan with them. At Christ-
mas they 7 returned to their old Roma home for a
week, and on the second day the swan turned up
there. Then when the family left Roma the bird
flew out to Grafton again.
* * * *
“A.E.M.”: The other day a Government
ranger in the wild Sounds dis-
trict of M.L. reported that he
had seen a notornis, a very
rare flightless bird with a large
blunt beak. Only four specimens
of this fowl have been captured.
Indeed, it was originally intro-
duced to science through fossil
remains, and it was not till after
the great Owen had done this
that the bird was proved to be
still living. A party out in the
southern wilds once killed and ate
the notornis, not knowing that its
skin was worth hundreds of
pounds on the London market. It
is curious that in so small a
country as Maoriland there should
stiH be doubt about the existence
of more than one bird. It is not
certain that the famous huia,
whose feathers adorned Maori
chiefs, has been wiped out. An
expedition to the back ranges
in the Wellington province failed
to find one, but since then two
are reported to have been seen.
There is so much country diffi-
cult of access that it is possible
for rare birds to continue to
exist unknown. An English
sportsman who lived in M.L.
for some years recently asked
the world to believe in
the possibility that the moa still lived in the
fastnesses of the Uriwera country, but he must have
had his leg pulled by somebody.
* * * #
“Ed”: Melton had a copious flow of hair
from his face —it was like a cascade. He arrived at
Melting per boot, bringing his house and bedding
on his back. He had two drinks at the Travellers’
Rest, and then seated himself in a corner of the
pub verandah, drew his knees up among his
whiskers, and, with the tumultuous hair flowing over
him to the floor, fell asleep. He was still sleeping
when the boys from Crowther came in, and starred
to investigate the phenomenon. Benno stirred it
up with a whip-handle; Bobbo probed it with a
stick. Then Craddock, the publican, sounded a note
of warning from the door: “Better mind what ver
up to with that hair, lads, ther’s a man hid in it.”
“U.P.” : It is a mistake to conclude that
settlers in the cow country think about nothing but
Strawberry. I was at a wedding recently, and dur-
ing the ceremony I distinctly heard the best man
ask hi? younger brother: “Did y’ bring the bull in
from the back paddock, ’Arry?”
“Dingbat”: Tell “Toby C.” (B. 25/l/’23),
who is looking for springboard tree-felling feats,
that on a scrub block adjoining Wallie English’s at
Wonvip, Gippsland (Vic.), two boys, just left school,
tried themselves on an ordinary blackbutt skyscraper.
I’-Jh worked at the one time, using two springboards
each, and they reached well over 100 ft. They did
not actually fall the tree, but took enough wood out
to show they could have done it —anyway, as they
were well up among the limbs, they would have
been looking for trouble had they done more. This
particular tree is on the road from Boolarra to
Toora, via Christie’s post-office. Intending investi-
gators will find pubs at each end of the road ; also
Bill Scanlan keeps a bush emporium about midway,
and his beer isn’t fightable.
“Gottem” : Having left a hole 6 x 5 x 2ft.
uncovered overnight, we found in the morning that a
rat had fallen in and couldn’t get out. But what
had me beat (and I was dead sober at the time) was
that the rat had a horn growing out from its nose,
rhinoceros-fashion. It was flexible, containing no
bony matter, and was an inch and a half long. Has
any seasoned Abo. seen a similar rhinorat, or what-
ever the dam’ thing was?
* * * *
“Centre”: Two Australian birds, the ibis
and the magpie-lark, are credited with having a
fondness for the cattle-tick as a food. But I’m
inclined to discount the good they’re supposed to
do as tick exterminators. Certainly I have seen
both of them sample a tick, but more as a hors
d’ceuvre than anything else. Considering the seri-
ous pest the tick is, why not import a few of the
real tick-birds of S’Africa? They practically live
on cattle-ticks, and I have often seen as many as
half-a-dozen of them having breakfast off an
infested bullock, scrambling all over the beast and
gathering a rich harvest, very much to the animal’s
gratification. The birds are harmless to everything
bn. the tick. They do not touch fruit, neither do
they interfere with other birds or animals. Even
if they did increase and multiply over here, after
the manner of other importations, the worst they
could do would be to clear the country of the tick
and do themselves out of a job.
* * * *
“Snell”: The Bulletin a little while ago
printed a Minns picture of a mug shearer who
explained, standing over a mangled sheep: “I thought
I could shear until I tried.” There was a mug
shearer played the same kind of cruel jest on a
jumbuck at a St. Arnaud (Vic.) station last season,
and when the boss uttered biting and profane com-
plaint, the dab excused himself with, “Well, I orter
know a bit about it; I held the book for Joe ”
(a well-known bookmaker) “for five years!”
* * * *
“E.K.”: The other day two scrub-turkey
eggs were brought in from the bush and left at a
refreshment-room at Herberton (Q.). They were put
ir. tumblers on a shelf, and on the following Sunday
the proprietress was surprised to find a young turkey
eyeing her over the rim of one of the tumblers. I
went along to inquire as to the welfare of the young-
ster this morning, and found it thriving, and that
it would take a drink and eat a little soaked bread.
The other egg is just cracking, and it should be
hatched in an hour or so. Nobody here appears to
know of a similar incident, so I pass it along to the
Council.
“Te Whare”: Re “Colub’s” black snakes
with white bellies (B. l/2/’23). I have seen only
one black devil wearing a dirty-white undergarment,
and that was on the South Coast of N.S.W., in a
quarter where the ordinary black snake with the red
belly is common. This serpent, I take it, was a
mere color variation, and not a distinct variety, or
there would have been more of him. A distinct
variety in Queensland, the black-bellied black snake
(Pseudechis mortonensis) , as the names imply, wears
an undertakers’ vest, while the fierce snake
(Pseudechis ferox ), recorded from Bourke (N.S.W.),
has a yellowish keel. The last-named wriggler is
said to attain 7ft. or more, but, fortunately, isn’t
common.
* * * *
“Sluggin Boggin”: Easily the highest-
placed job in Australia, a ' mile and more above
priministers, chief justices, governors-general and the
rest, is held by R. J. McGufficke, of Moonbar
(N.S.W.). He is boundary-riding on a line that
passes right over the top of Kosciusko, 7238 ft.
above the sea. It is boundary-riding of the real
old-fashioned kind, too, for there are no fences up
there. Unless the dingoes come up, which has not
happened this year so far, snow-blindness is the
worst thing that troubles the jumbucks. Some of
them get that badly.
* » * *
“Wild Oat”: The electric-cultured plants
mentioned by “Borom” (B. l/2/’23) that produced
four tomatoes averaging 18oz., have quite a long
\\ay to travel before catching some grown in the
Richmond (N.S.W.) district. Last year Harry
Douglas produced a great number that make
“Borom’s” look like pink pearls. The daddy of ’em
all weighed 21b. 13oz. They were staked plants of
the Ponderosa variety.
“FY7” : “Simon II.” says the coastal nig-
gers were not habitual cannibals, but that certainly
was not true of the N. Queensland blacks, who, as
many Abo. experts showed some time ago, were
cannibals whenever opportunity occurred. “Simon
II.” says the bunya feasts on the Darling Downs
lasted only three weeks. He should have said three
months. The cannibalism which took place towards
the end of the inter-tribal truce was not due wholly
to the scarcity of provisions among the outlying
tribes on their journey home; it was practised
because, the bunya nuts having been eaten
out, and the game killed or scared off the
countryside, there was an all-round food shortage.
Old men and women were then eaten to
save trouble on the return journey, and, since,
relations invariably grew strained at the end of
these quadrennial meetings, there were generally a
few carcases of fighting men available before the
final farewell.
* * * *
“Speculum”: If “X2X” (B. l/2/’23)
wishes to scotch the hookworm microbe, he will need
to do more than make the Queensland kiddies wear
shoes. The local swimming-hole will usually need
to be ruled out and watpr supplies rigidly super-
vised. A brief survey of the why and wherefore
of dejecta-borne diseases (typhoid, paratyphoid the
dysenteries, ankylostomiasis, bilharziasis, etc.),
leaves one in despair of anything but additions to our
local lists. Australian bush sanitation is too primi-
tive.
A SORT OF AUDITOR.
SKITELY (the village doctor): “It would
astound you, sir, if I told you the num-
ber of patients I have eased of their
troubles.”
MEEKLY (the village parson ): “Not at all,
sir—l have read the burial service over
most of them myself.”
“Te Whare”: In spite of Greg Mathews’s
fine and more modern work on our birds, grand
old John Gould still holds his own. His “Birds
of Australia” (8 folio vols., including the supple-
ment) is quoted in London at from £350 to £3BO.
It was originally published (by Gould himself) at
£ll5. Gould’s georgeous “Birds of New Guinea”
and those of the adjacent islands (5 folio vols.,
with over 300 colored plates) is ticketed £B5, and
his “Mammals of Australia” (3 folio vols.) £4O.
Many of the old Gould and Gilbert names (English
and Latin) for our birds have been changed, and
if those two great hirdmen were to rise from their
graves they would hardly recognise the once-familiar
birds under their new designations. But in most
instances the change was necessary and justified.
YARNIN’.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In shearing sheds and drovers’ camps,
In shanties, stores and bars,
In huts beneath the smoky lamps,
By tracks beneath the stars,
Beside the mill-fires, burning low,
Or near the station barn,
With hats pulled down and pipes aglow,
The boys sit round to yarn.
Then talk there is of work and play,
Of fight and sport and jest,
Of shearing feats and dances gay,
And of old mates “gone west.”
And there are pants to patch and mend,
And there are socks to darn,
When tired at the long day’s end
The boys sit round to yarn.
Oh, life has got its share of work,
Its dust and grime and sweat,
Where men are not the breed to shirk,
But toil for all they get;
And life has pleasure rich and rare,
In mill and hut and barn,
For rest is rest by camp-fires where
The boys sit round to yarn.
VICTORIA.

Few motorists have ever crammed 40 miles on the road into 60
minutes, and those that have, know it’s “travelling some.” Take a
route of 565 J miles, abounding in gutters, ruts and holes, with
mountain climbing and descending, plus 150 miles of wretched
bush track, and imagine averaging nearly “40” an hour —which
means keeping the “speedo” near “60” —for over 14 consecutive
hours. This is what Mr. S. C. Ottoway (of Sydney) did
on a 30 h p. Vauxhall when he recently lowered the
Melbourne - Sydney record by 55 minutes. His actual driving
time was less than 14 hours. It was a fine piece of sustained
speed work, the best yet recorded in Australia. Next to a highly
efficient engine in a run of this description is the question
of tyres. Mr. Ottoway selected
□
and they gave not the slighest trouble. The terrific strain
on the driving tyres daring such a run will be appreciated by motorists
but when one examines the unretouched photo of one of the VauxhaH’s
driving wheels depicted herewith one can only marvel at the condition
of the covers. There are thousands of gutters, holes and ruts on this
route that call for brutal brake work at racing speed, and corresponding
quick acceleration—this is what plays havoc with driving tyres—yet the
“Dunlops” show little signs of wear and cuts despite such treatment.
The cover shewn at times transmitted well over 60 h.p. at point of con-
tact with road surface, and revolved—in propelling the car and passen-
gers-334,860 times during the run, at a speed of 379 “revs” a minute,
and well illustrates the resistance to wear that is built into these tyres.
It is worthy of note that all the recent successful Inter a
state records have been accomplished on ** Dunlops.**
Tens of thousands of Australian motorists have actual experience of the
wonderful wearing qualities of “Dunlops”— they Know and will use
nothing else—but to those who are not acquainted with “Dunlop”
service this demonstration of super-tyre wear will convey an idea of
how “Dunlops” withstand the hardest of driving. Use them—it pays!

For the first time in its history Australia
has a Prime Minister with a profile, and the
woman taxpayer is asking herself with bitter-
ness why she was excluded from the civic
reception to the conquering Bruce the other
morning. The poinsettia- and fizz-decorated
tables were surrounded by city fathers and
political magnates, and, it is said, Mr. Bruce
has since adopted the slogan, “Make Sydney
Brighter.” Mrs. Bruce and a woman friend
were allowed to nibble a sandwich on the
doormat, though the blue tailorings and the
smart blue clotb-petalled hat of the good-
looking Prime Ministress deserved at least
a few pairs of discerning female eyes. One
woman visitor did stray into the party by
mistake, thinking it was a beano to just-
returned Ginger-pop Hammond. She was a
Maorilander who had become so dry with
the salt-water atmosphere surrounding her
mermaid countrywomen that she thought the
extra drought of a Prohibition smoke-o
wouldn’t do her any harm.
This week Sydney has been given over
more or less to the visiting Naiad. Large
quantities of her have been assembled by
rail and boat, and previous to her grand final
splash on Saturday she frivolled extensively
in jazz and joyous food. The N.S.W. Mer-
maids gave a Seventh Dimension party to
the visitors one afternoon, when the Went-
worth was packed with the water nymphs
from the other States, and even from chilly
Maoriland, each clutching a bowpot in her
club colors. The Maoriland maids were
young things, mostly dimples and shy smiles.
Violet Walrond is the slim, dark lass with
long hair who did Auckland proud last year
by being the only girl from Southland waters
competing in the Olympic Games. Christ-
church girleen Gwitha Shand has a cropped
fair head and a fascinating dimple, and looked
cool and fresh as a Canterbury primrose in
her yellow organdies. Mrs. Chambers made
the chaperone of dreams for the youngsters,
and other grown-ups who helped the after-
noon’s success were Mrs. Gately (Fanny
Durack who was) and Mina Wylie.
The Domain baths on Saturday afternoon
provided a cooling-olf spot for about half
Sydney and the whole of Maoriland, if you
could judge by the roaring Maori haka that
greeted Gwitha Shand and Violet Walrond
as they shot into the glass-green water for
the 100 yards championship; and you’d have
thought all Rotorua had burst when the two
visiting lasses reached the goal with only a
hand’s length between them, leaving Mina
Wylie a bit to the rear. But Mina is still
the prettiest thing in the water Sydney is
ever likely to see, and her defeat didn’t
seem to wipe any of the smile off her face.
The association must be grinning happily
over the gate money, for at 3 o’clock there
wasn’t standing room even at the back of the
big balconies. Crowds sat with their legs
dangling over the water’s edge, while the
diving towers were a proud point of vantage
from which Jack Tar scrutinised events, re-
freshing himself as the hour wore on with
a comprehensive afternoon-tea contained in
a beer-bottle.
The Women’s Union of Service waved a flag
in honor of the home-coming of Mrs. Mar-
garet Dale, who represented Australia at the
League of Nations’ Conference at Geneva.
The quiet backwater of the Queen Victoria
Club was the scene of the celebration, and an
interesting talk by Mrs. Dale was the chief
entertainment of an afternoon that was other-
wise floral decorations and teacups. The
North Sydney woman claims that the women
at the conference said more in fewer words
than the men delegates. And perhaps that
wasn’t so hard, either.
The Domestic Assistance Association
formed itself into a corporate body at the
Women’s Club last week. Ruth Beale, in a
militant blue hat, took the chair, and was
lucky to get it —lots of late-comers had to
be content with a door jamb or a bit of
wall to lean against. Mrs. Aronson, who
wore fascinating bird plumage on her black
lid, wanted to leap at one bound from the
immigration scheme to the establishment of
house-keeping schools. And that would be
an excellent thing, for our own girls could
roll up their sleeves and compete in the
great race for domestic employment. How-
ever, the main point seems to be that the
imported girls will be well looked after on
arrival by committees in the cities and conn-
try districts; younger girls from 14 to 16
will be placed in suburban homes, and not
sent into the baekbloeks.
The new courts at the White City had a
fast time of it living up to the inter-State
tennis players, who were watched by hun-
dreds of visitors on Saturday, the belle
among the onlookers being clad in poppy-
red voiles that swirled about her ankles. The
trophy display was the magnet of the club-
house. Everything, except a cradle, for the
use or adornment of the home seemed to be
there, and all built of silver. The Victorian
Boyd girl, who carries off the championship
from Mrs. Molesworth, is a plump, sonsy
lass with a sparkling eye and a rosy cheek.
Incidentally, the association’s Sherlock
Holmes is still on the track of him who
handed over to the press the allegedly-priyate
letter which it sent to champion J. O. Ander-
son, sternly bidding him not to argue with
an umpire any more.
A mob of flappers, ancient and modern,
has been grouped about Lambert’s dashing
portrait of himself. It’s a colorful canvas, and
if the artist’s scalp only had a coating of hair
he could “get away with” the mustard-toned
dressing-gown, the Italian hands, the slim
waist and even the ziff, and prove a real
lad among the girls. As it is, one genuine
flapper on Monday remarked with a giggle:
“Reminds me of the pictures of the wicked
Duke in mother’s old Family Herald.”
Arthur Streeton drops a line from Abbey-
road, which is mostly a sigh for Sydney in
general, and Mosman in particular. Since
leaving Sydney he has painted “like any-
thing” in F>ritish Columbia, the Rockies and
Seattle, then east by the C.P.R. to Montreal
and Evangeline’s country. He has a show
in New York, and loved Boston for a library
decorated by Chauvane, Abbey and Sargent,
and for a Museum with its splendid collection
of Sargent decorations. The postscript, as
usual, contains the real news, that delightful
Tom Roberts and his wife should be in Aus-
tralia any day now, and that they intend to
settle here.
There was a small show of crafts work
which hardly counted itself even amongst
the also-ran the other afternoon. Mrs. Violet
Eyre, Maude Russell and Misses Booth and
Mackenzie were the conspirators. The pot-
tery work of Vi. Eyre (hubby signs his
name to D.T. cartoons) included a lustre-
glaze vase that would get itself talked about
anywhere. A brilliantly-flnished bit of work;
background the color of desert sand, with dark
figures, camels and Arabs in relief. Hand-
weaving—the glowing patterns fashioned on
a small Danish loom by the Mackenzie and
Booth craftswomen—and three sun-dial de-
signs by Maude Russell. All modestly buried
in a studio in Queen’s Chambers.
What the books leave to the punter at the
end of the Easter meeting the St. Vincent’s
Hospital Ball committee is blithely setting
out to wrest from him. This ball is gener-
ally the kick-off of the Town Hall season. At
the first committee meeting the other morn-
ing it was decided to put an extra dash into
the great night by making the ball an affair
of posters and giving prizes for teams as
well as individual costumes. Mrs. Toohey
was at the helm and was surrounded by the
tried crew which every year makes this
function a financial success that wouldn’t
discredit even Captain Kidd.
Poetess Dora Wilcox introduced herself
to May Moore’s camera the other morn-
ing with this
pleasing result.
Her present camp-
ing-spot is Macleay-
street. (Girls, the
same roof covers
George Lambert!)
After a week or tw r o
she journeys back
to Maoriland, which
she left as a girl
and has not since
visited. Her native
town .is Christ-
church, and she has
journeyed far since
she and her mother
left it 20-odd years
ago. She is busy
brushing a new book
of verses, but she
wants to get the
stinging salty cleanness of the gorse-
laden wand through them, with the charm of
the rata and the golden glow of the kowhai;
so probably the last touches will be etched
in from some green-girdled, mist-swept south-
land town.
President of the Dickens Fellowship
Aubrey Halloran and his popular wife enter-
tained over 80 members at the Rose Bay
home, Glenview, last week, as a prologue to
the 1923 session. The big ballroom over-
looking the terraces that sloped by lantern-
lit ways to a tiny stretch of beach was the
scene of the foregathering; there many a
Dickens story was retold, and the society’s
treasures were fingered lovingly. The
photograph of former member “Pickwick”
Crouch beamed on the assembly, and seemed
to throw a particular gleam in the direction
of old-time member Miss Elizabeth Betts.
Of course it may have been the breeze
through the wide-flung windows, but it
seemed that the rose and the stately amaryl-
lis nodded in approval as some of the best-
known and -loved bits of Dickens were read
aloud. Afterwards supper was served in the
upstairs music-room and on the wide bal-
conies.
Last February this Letter noted the
wedding of Daisy O’Hanlon and J. Caragh
Gorman, owner of Googong station, Quean-
beyan, which took place on the same day as
that of Princess Mary. Now comes the
news that baby Thomas Neville Gorman
arrived on the same day as the Lascelles
bantling; but, lest she be accused of carrying
her imitative loyalty too far, Mrs. Gorman got
in first by three hours!
The Australia nearly had to look for an-
other managing director a couple of months
ago. William Tilley, of Sydney Stock Ex-
change, who went to Europe with his wife
and daughters, almost said good-bye to the
job. After looking in on Norway and
Sweden and taking a run through France
and Germany, lie returned to London, and
there found an operation was urgently called
for. Afterwards something went wrong, and
until a roving clot of blood was located and
arrested his life hung by a very thin thread.
But he is better now, and Sydney should
see him again at the end of next month.
Herewith the photograph of J. Randal
Carey, one of the founders of the Daily
Telegraph, and
chairman of its
Board for so many
years that even Dr.
Ward has missed
the count. Like his
paper’s brilliant asso-
ciate - editor, M r.
Carey lives on the
North Shore, in a
home surrounded by
a garden blooming
with flowers in sea-
son and out of
season. His one
hobby is the Royal
North Shore Hospi-
tal, and he has the
reputation of being
able to pluck sub-
scriptions for that
institution from his
own and his friends’ cheque-books as easily
as a conjuror produces rabbits out of his
coat-pocket. He plays no games, but has a
daughter who prides herself on her good
address—as all golfers do. (That is a Wode-
house joke. This Letter could think of at
least three better ones, if it had time.)
Mrs. Kingsmill Shaw, of Sydney, has just
given her daughter Nellie a wedding break-
fast somewhere in Northern Italy. The
bridegroom in the case was Ferruccio Quer-
cetti, a banker of those parts; and among
the guests bidden to the feast were old friend
Hazon and Cecil Sherwood, the Australian
tenor who has been singing for years in
Italy under a stage name.
Medicine and Divinity have joined hands
in the engagement of young Methodist par-
son Harold Wood to Dr. Olive Ivelynack
O’Reilly, daughter of the late Dr. W. W.
J. O’Reilly, of College-street, and sister of
the capable Dr. Susie O’R., Dr. Linnell O’R.
and some more of the cultured clan. The
O’Reillys have been props and stays of the
Methodist faith for donkey’s years, grand-
father having brought the sample with him
from England. Also, they are allied by
association and marriage with the moneyed
Yickerys.
Tom Hughes and his lady are leaving for
Britain this month. The ex-mayor has a
great affection for England—he was educated
at Stonyhurst. Then there are Geoffrey’s
wife’s people to make a friendly call on.
Doubtless Roger’s grave will also be included
—that elder son whose little boy made such
a charming page to son Geoffrey’s bride a
few weeks ago. The Geoffrey Hughes couple
are coming under the parental roof at Double
Bay during father and mother's absence.
Dead at 81). Mrs. Marv Tliurlow, widow of
C. A. Thurlow. of the Lands Department,
who was a musician of note. She lived for
half-a-century in a cottage off Campbell-
street, North Sydney, which was partly built
from portions of the wreck of the Dunbar.
In the long ago, when James Martin, as
Premier, reduced Civil servants’ salaries 10
per cent., Thurlow and a fellow clerk threat-
ened to become itinerant musicians, each
with a breast-label indicating that they
couldn’t live on their attenuated screws.
There died at Cronulla the other day Mrs.
Mary Nichols, who was the first white child
born on Lord Howe Island. She was 76 at
the end, and had never left the island until
she came to visit her daughter, Mrs. Laur-
ence, at Cronulla.
After sampling Sydney for three months,
Mr. and Mrs. j. W. Donohue, of Denver,
Colorado, left by the Tahiti. Mr. Donohue
is a nephew of Pat Carney, the Bananaland
racing man and station owner. Before leav-
ing Mrs. Donohue poured out a lot of sweet
talk about us. “I think your girls lovely.
They have fine athletic figures, good com-
plexions, and are buoyant, natural and
gracious. But though they have great
natural beauty they do not know how to
make the best of themselves. In the street
Australian girls do not dress as well as we
do—they lack our French touch—but in the
evening they dress better than we.” And of
course our beaches were a joy such as they
had met nowhere else.
'‘Shine, lady?” is the war-cry of an
establishment that is being set up in Otis
Chambers, King-street, where a woman may
be dry-cleaned and renovated from shoe to
collar. For a few pence you can smoothe
the creases from your summer frock with an
electric iron ; your dusty or splashed white
shoes can be made snowy in the twinkling
of an eye; you can secure that torn flounce
by a few seconds at the sewing-machine
standing ready in the corner. Sounds like
the Millennium! It’s the idea of an ex-
Maorilander, Mrs. M. F. Williams.
Artist Ellis Silas tells a story of probably
the quaintest mannequin parade since Eve
and Lilith picked new-season styles in the
Garden of Eden. Silas desired to purchase
some of the skirts worn by the native women
—skirts made of cocoanut and other fibrous
leaves, beaten out till they acquire the tex-
ture of silk. His boys informed him that
the best line in petties belonged to the oldest
belle in the village. Silas immediately called
on the lady, who signified her willingness to
trade, but refused to bargain that day. The
following morning Silas received a small
deputation of the youngest and prettiest
lasses in Trobriand. Each girl posed, and then
walked slowly past him with an inimitable
swing of one of the desired skirts ; and each
girl had been beaded and decorated by the
old lady in the most approved feast-day
style. What a designer some department-
store has lost!
Hampstead (Eng.), like Chelsea, a chosen
abode of London’s literary and artistic folk,
is dotted about with Australasians of note.
Richard Hellaby, the M.L. artist whose pic-
ture at the Goupil lately was admired —and
sold—is there with his clever painter-wife,
Ruth Hollingsworth, though they meditate a
trip south ; and Dora Wilcox has but recently
left her 18th-century cottage. Laurie Taylor
still draws kangaroos not far from the ’Eath,
and sister Marjorie, the singer, who recently
wedded another Australian artist (in Hamp-
stead Parish Church), has set up house-
keeping lower down. And Edith Fry, most
versatile of Australian women, has taken a
flat over Laurie’s, where she can snatch a few
moments of repose in her busy life of paint-
ing, poeti’y and criticism.
Here’s a swimming story from Maoriland.
The small girl had been beaten in the school
swimming carnival, her rival winning by
about a yard. The small girl, to her family’s
surprise, took the beating nonchalantly.
“You see,” she explained gravely at the
family tea-table, “Eugenia Gropher should
swim better’n anybody else. Her father
keeps a fishshop!”
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matt crept quietly back to Government House
on the 15th with the red dust of Toowoomba and
tiie grey dust of the black-soil country on his shoes.
His Stanthorpe recollections are principally of the
beauty of the peaches—tree-growing variety.
Col. Cameron and his spouse are off on the Dio-
genes to London. Claude Monteath is also making
for the Big Smoke—his farewells took the form of
an organ recital backed by the warbling of Ted
England and Eunice Cochrane of the fair tresses.
Mrs. Coocliin Bell gathered the muses for a gold-
colored luncheon at the ’ Bellevue the other day.
Corn-tinted tulle and cactus dahlias gave the auri-
ferous touch.
Tennis was the order of the afternoon of the
Horstmann girls’ farewell to Alice Hawthorn. Mrs.
Tom Macleod (back from reading a paper at ihc
Country Women’s conference in Toowoomba) was
there, also blonde Enid North, brunette Marjorie
Byram, Leith Graham, and the Boss Munroes. The
Horstmanns, by the way, are off to the Apple Isle
for a holiday.
Senator T. V. Crawford, who gets a place in
the Spruce-Page cabinet, has seven stalwart young
Australians to his credit, and is still in his prime
—he celebrated his coming of age by getting married.
He was reared on a l ie. farm and is a printer by
trade, but 27 years ago he started to grow cane,
and since then has been elected president of the
A.S.P.A. 14 times.
G. A. Whatmore, whose yacht, Miss Brisbane, won
the Frank Albert cup, is a shining light in the
local Shakspeare society and hand-in-glove with
Allan Wilkie.
Mrs. Lee Brown is heading for America after a
visit to the Canning Downs Barneses. Before start-
ing her journey to the land of Prohibition and wood
alcohol she provided a dish of tea at the Hotel
Cecil amid gerberas in silver vases and a cloud of
asparagus fern.
Dons are returning to the fastness of the ’Varsity,
which now boasts a lady on its directorate. “Supreme-
Literary-Gift” Tucker has temporarily deserted Mel-
bourne to take the rod and staff of Globetrotter
Michie. He will instruct lively young- Brisbane
in the dead languages for a term.
The Authors and Artists’ Assoc, takes its 1923
preliminary canter on March 6, with a social even-
ing, and the members are busy polishing their

Permanent Hair Waving
Accentuates Attractiveness
The many advantages of softly waved hair are
too obvious to need much commendation. To
the smart woman, so important a part does it
play in her coiffure, that it has become quite a
fashionable craze. Farmer’s use a special, per-
manent hair waving process which produces
exquisite waves that remain the same even
after shampooing, and does not in any way
effect the growth, or destroy the natural sheen.
Appointments may be booked by personal
application in the Hairdressing Salon, Third
Floor, or by phoning, City, Eleven Thousand.

Racing, from a woman’s point of view,
began this year at Caulfield on Saturday.
Being an autumn meeting, naturally Mel-
bourne got into its summer clothes, and the
weather only needed the hint as to what
Sassiety wanted., and out blazed the sun.
Georgette, organdie and crepe de Chine had
their very best outing. The Jack Irvings’
family party came in pale greys and blues
and pinks, and Mrs. Fred Thiel was smart
in navy and buff. Mrs. Rupert Downes’s
amber organdie shone in the sun, and Doris
MacKinnon’s frock was Paisley-patterned
georgette, while Mrs. Beau Fairbairn took
the lawn in baby blue. Mrs. Oscar Lem-
priere wore yards and yards of draped geor-
gette in cloud grey. Edna Armytage, Joan
Chirnside and Alison Madden fluttered in
pale thin raiment, Mrs. Arthur Robb had
bronze beads glinting from brown georgette,
and Mrs. Allan Tye was in rich blue geor-
gette embroidered with silk.
Everybody’s doing it. If many more of
our best-gilded hostesses dash off to be in
time for the royal orange-blossoming, the cur-
tain will be rung down on our own first-line
social activities.
The Hotel Windsor is showing signs of
becoming thoroughly Parliamentary. The
inter-State visitors put up at this tavern,
and last week an interesting party in the
lounge included the wives of the new Min-
isters. Mrs. Groom is not yet down from
Bananaland. She always makes her pres-
ence felt among clothes-loving feminines,
seeing that she carries such an excellent re-
pertoire of frocks. Mrs. Pearce is “in
things” once again, and is coming up fresh
and full of vim after her rest. Himself,
however, is looking rather worn and tired!
And his walrus moustache is now a mere
small grey episode.
There was a notable absence of the
smartest first-nighters at Her Majesty’s on
Saturday, and, as usual, lovers of the Bard
weren’t numerous enough to take their
places. No doubt the summery tempera-
ture affected the highbrow appetite for
Roman tragedy, though perhaps many, with
memories of Oscar Asche’s plump wrastler
in the previous show, didn’t relish the sight
of the same superabundance of tissue threat-
ening to burst through the toga of Antony.
Oscar, as Antony, wears his hair plain,
with the undramatic innovation of side-
boards. But he carries his bulk unex-
pectedly veil in the bedsheet of the legis-
lator, though, as a warrior arrayed for battle,
he looks like the well-fed head of the Roman
Fire Brigade. His other noble compatriots
wear the customary garments with the decora-
tive sandals or red boots of the time, though
one goes to the war in a handful of tinware
evidently designed for sun-baking purposes
before the serious business at Philippi.
Allan Wilkie and his attractive lady watched
from the front stalls, and sundry members of
his company were scattered about. The
appearance of George Tallis, lingering
morosely about in mufti, coupled with the
shrieking emptiness of the managerial boxes,
added to the impression that this was an
“off” night in the J. C. Williamson calendar.
Anyone familiar with the habits of late
Under-Treasurer M. A. Minogue would
scarcely have expected him to develop a
heart. He was an active walking tourist,
and a few days back had been renewing
acquaintance with the Woods Point scenery.
Easily the most popular of the heads in the
State service, the secret of his success was
his wide tolerance warmed by his wonderful
geniality. He leaves a widow, five sons and
two daughters. One of his boys, Harry, is
a good journalist, and threatens to become a
good lawyer. Another has dabbled in paint,
and has contributed in prose and black-and-
white to The Bulletin.
Lucy Drake, who smoothed the path of life
for thousands by training many girls who
are now teaching the domestic arts in tech-
nical and day schools all over Australia, has
given her last demonstration and cooked her
final pancake. Beginning in Vic. Education
Department she completed her studies at
South Kensington, London, and for the last
12 years was head of the domestic section at
Swinburne Technical College, at Glenferrie.
She was one of a brainy family. The late
E. T. Drake, Sec. of Public Works, was a
brother, and Dr. Drake, an expert in tuber-
culosis, is another.
Lady Forbes Robertson has been swish-
ing about Melbourne with lovely frocks and
breezy talk. She knew the village of yore
when she was just Maxine Elliott’s “little
sister.” Her present visit is merely a recon-
noitre—Adelaide stages her opening season.
The adoring speeches of the lady about Oscar
Asehe as a Shakspearean have set some
tongues wagging anent an amalgamation.
The Women Automobilists’ parlors in
Anzac House wore a glad expression the
other afternoon, when the H. J. Robertson
and James Angus matrons opened the club’s
autumn social offensive with cake and song.
Tenor Cohelo and his Mrs. Rachel Cohelo
were star guests. Mrs. Robertson had but-
tressed herself in navy georgette and smiled
under a fetching blue hat drape, while Mrs.
Angus flew red wool embroidery from smart
blue tailorings under a black toque bristling
with ostrich foliage. Edyth Harrhy turned
on some lilting nursery melodies, which she
created for her own babes, but is preparing
to launch for any old infant’s use. There
were other musical items, but the hectic
moment of the party was supplied, after the
cake consumption, by Coscia.
White-haired Scotchbyterian cleric J. C.
Johnston and his comely guid wife, formerly
of Echuca, having steered a safe course
through 50 years of matrimony, sat down to
their golden-wedding feast at the Malvern
kiosk on the 12th. Six sons and four daugh-
ters, with their other halves and 19 children,
and a scattering of lesser relatives, showered
the pair with gifts and congratulations ; and
these were heavily reinforced by offerings
from a crowd of friends who had been bidden
to an after-reception. J. Pearson handed over
a costly trophy from old pals at Kyogle
i • )’ where the cleric, who is nearing
lus Buth milestone, preached his final ser-
inons. The golden bride was an Aussie girl,
Rachel Millar, whereas the ’groom came to
rom the land o’ bagpipes at the age
• Ari tde brightened his Divinity course
m Melbourne by rowing in the ’Varsity boat,
and was one of the four who bagged the
Grand Challenge Cup in ’69. There’s history
for you.
Maud Grantham, who has done her share
ot gratuitous service in good causes, is off
to England next month, with the idea of
away a year. There was a meeting
at the Queen’s Hall last week to arrange
for a farewell recital, whereat the lady’s
friends and admirers should make a large
fuss over her excellent work. The recital
k 1 i ha PP en , on March 19 at the Queen’s
Hall, and though a varied programme has
been asked for, it is presumed that the buxom
lady will devote not less than half-an-hour
to her early love —Dickens’s “Christmas
Carol, m which she shows her talent at its
best.
1 aith-healer J. M. Hickson, back among
his native g-um-trees after 26 years on the
other side of the Equator, is a fine, cheery-
.?okmg man, more suggestive of commerce
than spirituality. He conies with the bless-
ing of the Anglican Church, and will start
healing operations in his native Speck.
Among his sisters, cousins and aunts are
the well-known Ffrench family, in which
is included the Robert Power widow. Mrs.
Hickson, who takes no part in her husband’s
campaign, is the eldest daughter of the Mel-
bourne Cricket Club President and the daddy
of Australian footer. H e still shelters i n his
ivew homestead which his daughter left 26
years ago on her honeymoon tour, and she
is now staying in the home of her girlhood.
Alongside is the wife of Prime Minister
Hruce, whose well-chiselled features grace
another part of this
page. The matron is
really a credit to
Victoria’s old squat-
tocracy. for she was
one of the seven
good-looking Ander-
son sisters whose
mother was a Mani-
fold. One sister
strengthened the
family ties by hitch-
ing up with cousin
Ed die Manifold.
Rosie, the youngest
of the seven, married
the Irvine dame’s
legal brother Ewan.
Mrs. Bruce, like
many others of Mel-
bourne’s social “best.”
is keen on philan-
thropic work and decorates the committee of
the Toorak-South Yarra end of the Red
Cross Hospital auxiliaries. She and her
husband (when he isn’t Prime Ministering)
divide their time between a Frankston farm
and a Mayfair flat.
The Austral Salon entertained singer
Coscia and his wife (she in brown, with nas-
turtiums wandering round her hat), and
some of the Aussie talent turned on by Billy
Burrell, Guy Moore, Edyth Harrhy and little
Mrs. Con Daly must have surprised them.
Coscia thought he would sing himself; then
decided he wouldn’t.
A recent portrait in a London journal of
Lady May Cambridge shows that beautiful
young girl wearing a fascinating turban-
toque. The draped silk is caught above the
forehead with an ornament shaped like the
Prince of Wales feathers. If that is not
setting her cap, what is?
Elizabeth Wheatley, an Australian heiress,
aged 10 months, is off to England to become
acquainted with daddy’s people and compare
those relations with her big Australian clan
of Fairbairn. Mrs. Wheatley was Esther
Fairbairn when she married a quiet little
aide from the Governor’s staff, and gave him
a few sheep to look after. Since then the
war turned him into a Brig.-General, but the
pair have “stayed put” in Australia for the
past three years.
Stately, luscious-voiced Mrs. Jimmy Nott
Osborne (Maude Jeffries as was) has
brought her grip and son Bedford this way
again. She is at present flat-hunting, as
her hopeful is at Melbourne Grammar.
Should she require a butler there will be a
long queue of applicants.
This is a Broothorn portrait of our new
Priminister, Stanley Bruce, the most highly-
veneered politician we have yet produced.
He wears immaculate clothes, a stunning
profile and the air of a Young Lady’s Jour-
nal hero. Also, in the family ice-chest he
keeps a Military
Cross and Croix de
Guerre earned on
the Gallipoli and
French fronts as a
British Fusilier offi-
cer. The war caught
him when he was
looking after the
London end of his
softgoods activities,
so he had been a long
time on foreign soils
ere he shed a cap-
tain’s khaki to come
back to his native
gum-trees. One of
Bruce’s two brothers
—-they both married
daughters of the late
Dr. Jackson—w a s
killed in action. The
new P.M. talks well, a fact that was fore-
shadowed in his prep.-school days at the old
Toorak College under the late John Craig,
for he was then the brightest youth in old
George Lupton’s elocution class.
The Sophocles took several “well-knowns” :
Mrs. Ronald Murray, who, with her two
hopefuls is going to link up with her mother,
Mrs. Alec “Aroona” Landale, in London;
Ada Reeve, who goes to recuperate and play
a little in S’Africa before voyaging on to
the Fog on the Edinburgh Castle; widow
“Malster” Burston, with a fair-haired daugh-
ter, _ and pretty Gwen Rawlins, of Uroly
station, Narrandera.
The Dancing Brenans, Jennie and Eileen,
send a coo-ee from London, where they had
just arrived after whipping off the cream of
the best dancing in the Riviera and Paris.
They linked up with dameuse Maggie Dick-
enson and her husband and hoped to meet
Rose Musgrove Garrick, who was in South
Devon with her son David, and was shortly
returning to her tea plantation in Ceylon.
Mistinguett, at the Casino de Paris, 'took
their fancy for cleverness. Naturally they
gathered some fascinating new steps for the
dancing feet of Melbourne.
Not inappropriately the Bankruptcy Court
was used for hearing the undefended divorce
suit in which Mrs. Laura Edwick obtained
a decree nisi with £lO,OOO in lieu of alimony
from squatter William Ernest Edwick.
McArthur, J., told Edwick that he had no
sense of honor, shame or decency, and the
crowd in the court thought that ’S’Onor
didn’t overdo it. In 1914, when the wife was a
girl of 16, Edwick wooed her at liis station
at Traralgon, where her dad was manager.
Two months later in his town house, near
the Melbourne Mint, he began to exhibit
habits more becoming a stye than a home.
Then came shameless exploits. Now the wife
gets the custody of the child of the marriage,
and the £lO,OOO which was offered by respon-
dent’s proctors is for the maintenance of
both.
Yea is in mourning for Dr. Colin Camp-
bell, who had looked after its health for
several years—since Oswald Shields went
overseas. He was the idol of the district,
but while fighting for other people’s lives he
neglected himself, and his mother (the widow
of a doctor) is now lamenting her brilliant
33-year-old son. Her grief is shared by a
big circle of old Scotch College boys and
Varsity contemporaries.
Passed out at St. Kilda the other day,
Mrs. Catherine Elizabeth Hope, widow of
Dr. Robert Cuthbertson Hope, of Geelong,
one of the original members of the elective
Leg. Council of Victoria. She was a
daughter of parson Thomas Ilassall, who
came as an infant with his parents from
Tahiti in 1796, and after bemg educated in
England returned as Colonial Chaplain in
1821. He married the eldest daughter of
old parson Sam Marsden, and the first child
of the union was the lady who has just gone
over within two years of completing her cen-
tury.
Just as he was ready to launch an amateur
production of “The Superman,” with him-
self in the part of John Tanner, young Beres-
ford Fowler was engaged by Allan Wilkie, so
he will shortly depart on a tour that will em-
brace Adelaide, the Speck, and probably
Queensland, before he gets back to Melbourne
Fowler is responsible for the recent interest-
ing revivals of Ibsen’s “John Gabriel Bork-
man” and “Ghosts,” and he felt very confident
about the prospects of Shaw’s classic, because
he had captured a very good cast. However,
lie hopes to be able to present the play at a
matinee in Melbourne anon.
The hospital auxiliary workers are renew-
ing activities this month. The Toorak
branch, which does its bit for the Alfred,
started the ball rolling in the Stanley
Argyles’ front parlor. It is a very swanky
branch, and hands out the goods and the dol-
lars with the real hang-the-expense air. The
other Toorak section which helps the Chil-
dren’s Hospital will not get into harness
until March, when it will foregather at the
John Turnbull widow’s. That lady, by
the way, has been having an anxious time
since daughter Jean contracted typhoid, but
the patient has now won through to con-
valescence.
The Sistine Choir solists are to do another
little dash in Melbourne ere they return to
Italy by the Orvieto. The Town Hall has been
engaged for five nights, from March 19, and
the select party of signors will sing some
operatic numbers which they never touched
when they had their first season in Mel-
bourne. In Maoriland the Sistiners have
had the time of their lives—22 weeks of
civic receptions and financial triumph.
A coo-ee from London: —
Percy Grainger crossed the Atlantic a few weeks
ago to give a series of concerts in Holland, and
had to extend his season. A number that always
roused Dutch enthusiasm was his own exhilarating
setting of “Camptown Races.” Between concerts he
hopped over on a 24 hours’ visit to his London pub-
lishers. The ever-young Percy, whose good looks
acquire distinction with the years, is about to re-
tire from concert-work for a couple of seasons to
devote himself to composition. Meantime his
works are warm favorites with British audiences
owing to their sheer joyousness. They appear on
the highest-browed programmes and are always a
draw.
Elfie Dix;on, elder daughter, of the Wayman Dixons
of Ay ton House, embarks in a couple of weeks for
Victoria, there to take Dudley Sawtell Lawrence,
of Bairnsdale, for better or worse.
Dr. Helen Sexton and Mrs. Blackwood, late of
Melbourne, have pitched their tent together in Lon-
don, said tent being a charming house in Chelsea.
For the moment the two friends are touring Italy,
where they have been joined by Miss Austin.
Gladys Owen (Sydney), who is in Hampshire on
a visit to her sister, Mrs. Elliott, spent a festive
week in London for Christmas shopping, as the guest
of uncle Frank Longworth, ex-Head of Charterhouse.
She was seen at “The Laughing Lady” in a jolly
little triangular party, the third being her cousin,
Miss Pilkington, daughter of R. R. Pilkington, K.C.,
late of Perth (W.A.).
After five years working up and down India and
Burma as superintendent of the Lady Minto Nursing
Association, Ruth Darbyshire (sister of Taylor Darby-
shire) gets the job of matron of the London ’Varsity
College Hospital—a plum of its kind. Lady Minto
(founder of the Indian institution), by the way, lives
modestly these days, with little evidence of the
historic splendor of the Minto family’s century-
long association with India; but she is not for-
gotten by her friends. Queen Alexandra is one
of the old familiars who drop in to take tea with
her in her little cottage at Pimlico.
A line or two from Adelaide:—
'the amateurs struck a blazing day for their race
meeting at Cheltenham, but the attendance, even of
women, was extraordinarily good. C. H. Angas
took the place of the absent president (R. M.
Hawker), and did the honors of the official lunch,
while Mrs. Angas had as her guests Lady Bridges
and Miss Judge, Miss Alice Fisken, and the A. V.
Benson and W. W. G. Tait dames. She had a
tea party in the afternoon, too, with the Bridges,
the John Barkers, some Kidmans, Mrs. Ernest Good
and her twins, the Sydney Reids, the Hugh Crawfords
and the Alan McFarlanes among the guests. Dress-
ing swung mostly from coolest pastel georgettes
and muslins to the inevitable navy morocaine. The
devotees of the former included Lady Bridges, Mrs.
Fred Porter, Miss Phyllis Bray and Miss Eileen
Nicholas (who hails from Corowa), and among
those who favored the latter were Mrs. Alan MeFar-
lane, Mrs. Ernest Good, and Miss Hugh Crawford.
Miss Rita Toms is back from a flying visit to
Melbourne, and the date of her marriage to A.
V. Davenport is fixed for early March. Another
engagement is being talked about too —that of Irene
Scarfe to L. Lynch.
Rita Coonan, another of this State’s songsters
who won commendation from Melba, sailed for the
Cold Country in the Esperance Bay. She plans to
go almost immediately to Paris, where she will
study under masters chosen by the Dame.
Report has it that Captain Avern is to be sea
expert on the Board of the Commonwealth liners.
He has a host of friends here who will send him con-
gratulations if the appointment comes off. His wife
was an Adelaide Varley, and one of the most
decorative of the younger set of her day.
Ihe Leonard Lindons ai'e back, after a long stay
on the other side, where he has been annexing fresh
medical honors. She is the only daughter of the
Humphrey Martins and they are to stay with her
people while on the wearisome job of house-hunting.
The Sillifants, who’ve lately come into possession
of an estate in North Devon, are in the final round
of packing and good-bye, and are booked to sail
for England at the end of the week.
Woodlands school was opened on Saturday, with
a garden party to celebrate the event and let people
extend the glad hand to headmistress Dora Gillam.
The Bishop gave the venture his benediction, as
did Lady Bridges, whose small daughter is to be
one of the day pupils.

The most interesting race at Caulfield on
Saturday was the St. George Stakes. It was a
nine-furlong w.f.a. event with penalties, and Euryth-
mic., The Cypher, Whittier, Sister Olive, Harvest
King, Shillinglee, Tangalooma, Sir Andrew, Wirriway,
Caserta and Easingwold made a toney field. Euryth-
mic and The Cypher carried the big money, whilst
Whittier and Sister Olive would have been good
winners for somebody, as well as the books. Such
backing for The Cypher was unaccountable, seeing
that in good company the Maorilander has never
distinguished himself this season over a short or
middle distance. His recent “down the line” win
over a mile was hardly worth considering. Anyhow,
The Cypher got into a bad place, and never looked
dangerous, whereas Whittier, who was giving him
101 b., finished a respectable fourth to Easingwold,
Eurythmie and Sister Olive. In giving 31b. to
beauteous Sister Olive and then fairly beating
Eurythmie at a difference of 121 b., Easingwold put
up his best Melbourne performance thus far. But
Eurythmie showed temper at the barrier, and put no
ginger into his finishing run. On this showing the
old original Eurythmie is no more. Sister Olive’s
run suggested that she wants a few gallops to get her
quite fit for the Australian Cup, in which she should
be nearly It at the finish.
Although the Oakleigh Plate is but a
scramble with a turn in it, the betting market
narrowly escaped a correct prognostication. Sun-
burst and Demetrius, starting favorites at fives and
sixes respectively, finished second and third, the
40-to-l shot Chelidon, with a late rush, beat Sun-
burst on the post. Weedah appeared to get knocked
out of it at a critical moment, and Lisnavane and
Coleus ran respectably only, but the chief disappoint-
ment was John Wren’s Little Flower. Where was
the little mare’s flying get-away, which was to para-
lyse most of the field, and enable her to obtain
such a lead as only one or two, at the most, could
overtake? Where was it? She was among the first
two or three for a while, and then she fell away
from grace like a curate sipping his first whisky.
The result of the Oakleigh, so delightful to the
books, who had not laid sixpence against Chelidon,
was to bring a new consideration into the Newmarket
question. The trusty Sunburst and Demetrius will
run great races, with good luck, over the Flemington
straight six (indeed Demetrius, in the meantime,
may nearly win the Futurity), but Chelidon’s way
of defeating Sunburst was impressive. The son of
Broadsword came with a rattle, and if the gelding
takes after father, who ran third to Queen o’ Scots
in the fastest Newmarket ever, his penalty will not
stop him from beating the true-running Sunburst
again. His original Newmarket burden was the
minimum.
Favorite for the Bond Cup, which was won by the
promising Pendil mare Penshurst, with Nautical
second, Stare put up a wretched performance. One
bad run once in a way may be excused, but the
nuggety little horse’s exhibition was strongly sug-
gestive of his having turned roguish, as is seem-
ingly the matter with Harvest King. He was in the
rear division all the way. Another Australian Cup
candidate that disappointed was Shillinglee in the
St. George Stakes. The English horse, who
has a bold, bad eye, was not expected to win,
for he was meeting Sister Olive on 191 b. worse
terms than Fate has decreed for them in the ap-
proaching long race; nevertheless Shillinglee’s “no-
where” was discouraging. He will have to do better
than that if he is to capture the Cup.
Salatis achieved a big weight-carrying feat in
winning the Salisbury Welter. The big brown horse
won the mile handsomely, giving as much as 471bs.
to several of the runners, and Sllbs. to one of them.
If the son of Sheoherd King and Traquette were
quick off the mark one would reckon him a 3-to-
-1 chance for the Newmarket, seeing that 8.10
is a luxurious weight for the large animal, but in
the ordinary way he is not so ready to find his feet,
and get properly balanced, as some of the bom
sprinters.
Next Saturday’s racing should clear up two or
three outstanding questions re some of the most
fancied goers for the Newmarket. For instance,
Easingwold’s running in the Futurity Stakes will be
a better guide to knowledge of his sprinting form
than was his unexpected win over nine * furlongs.
Then there is Maid of the Mist, quietly backed for
the Newmarket as though she had been marked for
fame. If her Newmarket chance is worth consider-
ing the filly must be worth backing, both ways,
for the Futurity.
“Tuart”: How is it so many good horses
came out of the West? In spite of its remoteness
and its relatively small population, the Groper State
sends more first-class cattle to Flemington and Rand-
wick than Queensland, S.A. and the Speck combined.
Consider a few of them since 1905: Blue Spec (Mel-
bourne Cup) ; Eurythmic (Sydney and Caulfield Cups
and a procession of w.f.a. races) ; Dyed Garments, Lily-
veil and lan ’Or (Sydney Cup) ; jolly Beggar (Don-
caster and second in Newmarket) ; New Tipperary
and Macadam (Australian Cup) ; May King (A.R.C.
Birthday Cup) ; Mistico, and now Easingwold and
Seorpius. Of course, all these neddies were imported to
Westralia in the first place, the Jarrahlanders being
shrewd and plucky buyers at the Sydney sales. But
there must be something in the Westralian climate or
feed to account for so large a proportion of their
purchases coming good. I suppose most readers
will laugh when I affirm that the best of the lot
mentioned was Misfit o. But the East never saw
this machine-like galloper till he was past his prime,
and then he won five or six good handicaps and
licked Magpie at w.f.a.
A piquant incident of the week was the
transfer of John “Baron” Brown’s string of horses
from F. J. Marsden’s stable at Randwick to that
of S. R. Lamond, who trains at Zetland. John
is addicted to changing his trainers, and Marsden
has lasted longer than most. But it is rather
ridiculous of Marsden to complain that he got
only 10 per cent, of the stake when Prince Charles
won the Sydney Cup. According to his own ac-
count, Brown’s horses won £35,000 in stakes dur-
ing the three years he looked after them, and if
he collected 10 per cent, after every win—in addi-
tion to training fees, of course—he was on an
exceptionally good wicket. Some of the Randwick
trainers receive no 10 per cent. Marsden has gone
to Melbourne with Prince Cox, who is engaged
in the Australian Cup. Among the horses still
under his care are the bonny four-year-olds, Furious
and Even Song, who, having been withdrawn from
the big Flemington handicaps, are bound to be
among the early fancies for the Doncaster and Sydney
Cup.

“Dunederra”: At the last meeting in our
wheat-and-sheep hamlet all the Rooks except one laid
2-to-l against the favorite, Sudden Death. The
exception stretched the odds a point and was rushed
with business, the local Eric Connolly taking £3O
to £lO. After a thrilling finish Sudden Death
came home by a head. “Good race that,” said Eric,
genially, to the leader of the 2-to-l brigade. “Yes,”
replied Two-ter-Vun, “but not so goot as you’re
gointer see now.” It wasn’t, either. We haven’t

S.A. Jockey Club has had its hand forced
in the matter of stakes by the go-ahead Port
Adelaide people. Being the acknowledged controlling
body of racing in the State, it could hardly let its
Adelaide Cup lag behind the Port Cup, and the
former stake is accordingly to be raised to £2OOO
this May. After which the Adelaide Racing Club,
whose autumn campaign practically duplicates that
of the S.A.J.C., is likely to find £2OOO for its
Birthday Cup also.
“Jackeroo”: Printed that the recently-
formed Brisbane Amateur Turf Club has arranged to
buy John Wren’s Albion Park and Sandgate courses,
and is negotiating for the purchase of Doomben. It
seems almost too good to be true. Sandgate is a
joke—Wren holds one meeting a year there, and if
it rains the date goes to Albion Park. That course
has been a goldmine to the oily little gentleman who
used to run the shilling tote. Kedron Park and
Gooparoo are still on deck, but their meetings
have been considerably curtailed, and if things don’t
improve punters will have to be sandbagged and
carted there. By the way, there is no word of Wren
selling his interests in the Melbourne clubs that he
controls, or in his Perth (W.A.) courses, Belmont
and Goodwood. Strange that he should be cutting
loose from the only city which has a friendly Govern-
ment in office.
The bout between Sid Godfrev and Harry
Collins, at Sydney Stadium, recalled old times, inas-
much as there was £1772 in the house. They were
a splendidly-matched pair—each weighed 9st. lliilb.
FRED SEGAR.
the S.A. welter-
weight. He holds
decisions over
Stone and Josephs.
-—and put up a rous-
ing scrap. Godfrey
got the decision and
fairly earned it. He
had a shade the bet-
ter of the hard-fighting
Newcastle youth in
most of the 20 rounds
fought, and closed
Henry’s right eye in
the 14th with an en-
thusiastic left. Collins
is fast and game, and
always gives the public

The two assets he lacks
at present are experi-
ence and a punch.
“Haminer-ehewer”: In the Victorian 100
yards’ championship, Gale and “Lofty” Anderson
finished abreast, one on either side of the track.
When Gale* was proclaimed the winner the specta-
tors were divided as to the correctness of the de-
cision. Those nearest Gale were positive that
Anderson had won. But this is natural, for in
judging a close finish with both eyes open, the
runner furthest away will seem to be the winner,
as a simple experiment will prove. With the right
eye shut, focus into line two objects—posts, tree-
trunks, beer-bottles, anything that is handy. Open
the eye again, and the object furthest away now
appears to be well in front. So I’ll back the
judges’ decision. By the way, photos show that
while Gale, with outthrust Chest, has breasted the
tape first, Anderson’s foot is furthest over the line.
♦ * * *
In winning the Vie. half-mile title at Mel-
bourne Sports Ground on Saturday, Jack Newman
established the good time of lmin. 59 3-10 see., three
seconds better than his figures last year. With Gale
and Nicol missing, Anderson won the 220yds., eas-
ing up, in 22 4-ssee. F. Kohlman, of Hawthorn
Harriers, who was expected to annex the 3-mile
spin, could only get third to Featherston (E. Melb.)
and Brown (St. Stephen’s), who romped home in
that order. W. J. West threw the discus 102 ft.
Bin., the best Victorian performance of the kind,
but nearly 7ft. short of the longest Australian
throw. That stands to the credit of Kaarlo <l.
Naukler, the Finnish Consul, who died tragically in
Sydney a couple of years ago.
Although only a few days off the boat,
“Slip” Garr (N.S.W.) astonished the Maorilanders
by running 122yds. at Wellington (M.L.), in 11 4-5
sec. —at least, that is what the timekeepers said.
Carr started two yards behind scratch in a 120 yd.
handicap and won the final in 12 l-ssec. Reggie
Walker’s 11 2-ssec. at Johannesburg in 1908 is the
world’s best for an amateur, but Donaldson has
a professional record of 11 l-4sec. Carr’s meeting
with Ki.ksey the American and the Maorilanders
Wilson and Tracey promises to be memorable.

Clem Hill “came back” for George Gif-
fen’s benefit, and contributed a solid 66 to South
Australia’s first-innings total of 275, V. Y. Rich-
ardson top-scoring with 95. Clem’s achievement
in the second innings made his average 52.5 for the
match. Which shows that a man who has looked
after himself is not too old at 46—Hill will be that
on March 18—-even though it is years since he played
in first-class company. Another to reappear was
Clarence Edward Pellew, who has been follow-
ing the plough at Riverton, but he failed in both
knocks. Victoria’s 386 was mostly made by the
tireless Woodfull (123), and by Ponsford, the St.
Kilda star, who heaped more derision on the selectors
by adding a faultless 108 to his 429 against Tas-
mania. Mayne collet ted 40. South Australia tried
Fisher, the Uni. bowler, and E. J. Carragher, a
sawn-off Bosie from Broken Hill, who has played
one match (his first on turf) with West Torrens.
Both shaped promisingly. In the Central State’s
second innings J. T. Murray, a hitter from East Tor-
rens, came to light with a great 152. One result
of the match is that N.S.W. will resume possession of
the Sheffield Shield.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: George Giffen, to whose testi-
monial go the proceeds of the Vic.-S.A. match—and
they ran into four figures—was too big a factor in
Australian cricket to be forgotten by the present
generation. From 1882 to 1896 he*was in the very
front of things. He made 1000 runs and took 100
wickets in test-matches —-and there were far fewer
of them in his best day than latterly. In all he
made over 11,000 runs and took over 1000 wickets. As
a bowler, his special virtue was that he could get
men out on good wickets when others failed; on
sticky wickets he was outshone by SpofForth, Turner,
Palmer and others. He told an interviewer last
week that players of to-day practise too little.
“When I was making a study of bowling, for 15
years I seldom missed practising three evenings
a week, and I suppose I bowled for over two hours
and a half each evening.” He is still training boys
on the parklands before breakfast. Being 64 in
March, he is within sight of retirement from the
G.P.0., and the testimonial is intended to make
him comfortable.
“Winkle”: The inclusion of Edgar Mayne
in the Victorian team against South Australia,
after his failure in all Sheffield Shield matches this
year, and when there are so many colts with better
pennant averages waiting for a chance, raised another
howl of anger at Mayne’s expense. It is the man’s
misfortune and not his fault that he is repeatedly
picked when both out of form and out of luck. The
public, however, cannot forgive him for having
been preferred to Park for the last English trip,
when he had but moderate inter-State averages,
whereas Park had made 586 runs averaging 83.71
in 1919-20, and 451 averaging 64.44 in 1920-21.
Rightly or wrongly the opinion is held that during
the tour Mayne acted as unofficial representative
of the Board of Control, and that this is why he
is rewarded with the captaincy of the Victorian
XI, in place of the more capable Ransford. It is
worthy of note that when Edgar played with East
Melbourne, McNaughton was preferred to him as
captain. Of course, if he struck the form that enabled
him, in 1919, to make 213 with Park for the second
wicket against N.S.W., the fickle public would
veer round again, for in that innings he used every
stroke, and made each shot perfectly. But for
the past four years he has done little of note.
* * * *
“Andy”: “Basil” (B. 8/2/’23) on sports-
manship in cricket and tennis convinces me not. If,
as he contends, a man ought to sacrifice his wicket
when he thinks he is out, shouldn’t the converse
hold true, i.e., when a batsman is wrongly
given out, the other side should sacrifice a wicket ?
Quite obviously this sort of thing could be carried
to absurd lengths. Consider the spectacle of bats-
men walking off after being hit on the pads, and the
opposition dropping catches or bowling full tosses
on the leg just to show T the umpire that he is • a
cow. It would be the end of cricket. The game
is slow enough now, the Lord knows, without the
introduction of “improvements” that would kill it
in short order.

The feature of Melbourne pennant cricket
on Saturday was Melbourne’s headlong batting
against Northcote. ’Cote closed about 2.45 p.m.
with 6 for 289 (Yeomans, 120, and Gibaud, 61), and
in about three hours’ play M.C.C. hammered up five
for 340, thus scoring a first-innings win by five
wickets and 51. Fergie. a colt, was responsible for
164 and Armstrong was next best with 58. Were
such batting the rule instead of the rare exception,
pennant and grade cricket would be worth looking
at. But for the most part it is dismally suggestive
of a morgue.
» * * •
“Tom Pepper”: I have seen all the repre-
sentative express bowlers, English and Australian,
since Spofforth’s time, and, to my mind, Jones was
the fastest of the lot. At the beginning of his
career, when he played with the Broken Hill South,
he was most erratic and only occasionally delivered
a well-pitched ball. Later on he improved his
length and slightly reduced his pace. Rocking ’em
in against Broken Hill Banks, “Jonah” partially
disabled seven of the 11 batsmen. On another
occasion I saw him knock a stump 23 yards, and
one of the bails 56 yards. The wicket-keeper (lie
stood back 10 yards and had two long-stops) wonder-
ingly stepped the distances.
J. O. Anderson has been sternly rebuked
by the N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Association for arguing
NORMAN PEACH,
beaten by Anderson
in the final of the
N.S.W. singles.
the point with the umpire
during the City v. Country
match at Rushcutter’s Bay.
The young man invited
the chastening experience,
and it should do him no
end of good. At the N.S.W.
championship tourney he
carried all before him,
beating Norman Peach in
the Anal of the singles
(6-4, 6-3, 6-0), and, with
the same player, defeating
Kalms and Spencer. <in the
doubles (6-4, 6-2, 6-4).
But his backhand was
below par. Esna Boyd, the
Victorian, had a great
game with Mrs. Moles-
worth (Q.), the Australian
champion, for the State
title, and won by 4-6, 6-2,
6-3; but the brisk little
Northerner, with Horace
Rice, gathered the mixed
doubles from Miss Boyd
and Spencer by 6-4, 6-4.
Among the youngsters H. T.
Hicks, of Sydney Grammar
School, distinguished him-
self b' r winning a treble —
schoolboys’ singles and
doubles (with Griffiths),
and the State junior singles.
A son of the enthusiastic
T. 11. Hicks, he is a cham-
pion in the making.
Mina Wylie was a representative Aus-
tralian swimmer—she captured the 60-yards’ Austra-
lian title in 1908 —when Violet Walrond and Gwitha
Shand were toddling in the nursery. Considering that
fact, Miss Wylie did wonderfully well to get within
a few feet of the comely Maorilanders at the finish
of the race for the 100-yards’ Australian champion-
ship at Sydney Domain baths. Miss Shand, a
splendidly-muscled sample of girlhood, got the best
of a bad start and led for four-fifths of the journey,
with Miss Walrond steadily closing on her and Miss
Wylie within striking distance of both. At 90
yards, Violet had the lead and the slim 17-year-old
beat Gwitha home by half-a-yard, with the N.S.AV. girl a
yard further away. The time was 69 2-ssec. —3 2-ssec.
slower than Fanny Durack’s best effort, and 3 secs,
worse than that of Paula Hoeft. Miss Walrond had
another win in the 200-yards relay, in which she
was partnered by A. AV. Barry, who lost a leg in
the war. The pair won easily from Enid Charlton
and Frank Carberry; and another comfortable victory
was that of the N.S.W. team, Mina Wylie, Lily
Robertson and Enid Charlton, who vanquished the
Queensland trio, Elsie Venning, Lily Venning and
Mina Wylie’s contemporary, Mabel Springfield, in the
300 yards relay. Mrs. L. Wigney was much too clever
for the opposition in the diving competition. The
50 yards’ junior title, though won by the holder,
Ettie Robertson, was awarded to Very Pawley owing
to Ettie having steered a bad course. AVhereupon
Ettie burst into tears. She had finished two yards
ahead of Vera and knocked 3-ssec. off Lottie Fevyer's
record, so her luck was cruel.
At Adelaide, the same day, Frank Beaurepaire
made an impressive re-appearance by successfully
defending his half-mile title against Moss Christie
(N.S.AA’.), and Bill Harris (Honolulu). The time,
llmin. 67 l-ssec. was poor compared with Charlton's
llmin. 5 l-ssec., but “Bogey” had a cold afid
was never at his top. Joe Soussari, the 20-vear-old
Queenslander, added the 220-yards breaststroke to
his collection of trophies, finishing 4 yards ahead of
Les Uren (Vic.), in 3 min. 10 3-ssee. J. Toweil
(Tas.), was third.

Rowing in South Aus. is becoming a mat-
ter of City v. Country. Lately it has been mostly
City v. Murray Bridge, whose club eight has repre-
sented the State bodily, owing to the practical im-
possibility of a mixed crew training together. But
now* Mannum, a little higher up the river, is showing
good form. These two could train together. So
could Renmark and other settlements much further
up. Thus the State looks like being able again to
rely on a combined crew, to come from one of
three centres —Torrens-and-Port, lower Murray, or
up-river. Meantime the Murray Bridge boat will
go to Perth (AALA.) for the inter-State race, having
made short work of the only metropolitan crew that
ventured to oppose it.
Knocking chips off the Melbourne-Sydney
road record is becoming a weekly pastime among
motorists and motor-cyclists. Norman Smith, in
an Essex, did the journey in 14hr. 28min., but along
(Xime A. A r . Turner, in a Delage, and contributed
13hr. 47min. to the book. Charlie Kellow and H. B.
James started the business in 1908, their time being
25hr. 40min. Things have speeded up since then. At
the moment T. O’Dea, of Bathurst, owns the briskest
motor-cycle figures—lshr. 53min. But his tenure
is as uncertain as a flapper’s affection.

Goullet, the Australian cyclist, who makes
a speciality of winning the six-day contests favored
in America, has annexed the big prize for the seventh
time at Madison-square Garden, New York. His
team mate was the Italian Bellorie, and the pair
averaged 17 miles an hour for a journey of 2475
miles. Altogether Goullet has won 11 of these
wearisome struggles, but he can sprint as well as
stay. AVith a flying start he has ridden a mile, un-
paced, in Imin. olsec.
HEADIN’ ’EM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sixty members of a two-up school at Coburg (Vic.),
surprised by the police, fled in all directions pursued
by thirty stalwart constables. Some of the fugitives
were not caught and handcuffed till they had covered
over two miles.
Say, who are these, with cops in hot pursuit,
Who tear across the peaceful countryside?
A band of thieves escaping with their loot?
A mob of Bolshies just identified ?
The earth is gashed by many a ponderous boot.
The salt sweat pours from many a heaving hide.
God! what an epic hunt! And they who run —
What have they done?
Three score of desperados, I’ll be sworn.
What city underworld, 1 wonder now,
“Is emptied of its folk this pious morn,”
While helter-skelter over hill and brow
The grim chase sweeps —and uniforms are torn
And handcuffs clink and click. When, where and
how
Came all these crooks together, for a force
Of thirty Johns to course?
Starlights are here and Thunderbolts, maybe;
Kellys, perchance. Albeit intrudes a doubt
If such exist in nineteen-twenty-three.
(Observe! a couple more are down and out.
Hurrah for helmeted authority!)
But what the blazes is it all about?
What is these ruffians’ special brand of sin
That they should hunt them down and shoot them in?
Silence and let the grizzled sergeant tell
The tale. “We caught them in flagrante del.,
Making two pennies spin!”

The Western Australian Bank was established in 1841, just 82 years ago, and is
operated under Acts of Parliament of the Western Australian Legislature.'
The present paid-up capital of the Bank is £300,000, its Reserve Fund £700,000,
and its undivided profits £21,100.
HISTORY OP EARNING POWER.
The average net annual profits for the past eleven years, certified to by the Bank’s
auditors, were £61,769, out of which the Bank paid 20% Dividends and carried to
Reserve Fund £135,000.
In the first year of its existence the Bank paid a dividend, and has continued
without intermission for eighty-two years to pay regular dividends to its shareholders.
At the close of the latest accounts it had in assets over £l3l for every £lOO of
liabilities, a very strong proportion.
WHY NEW CAPITAL IS REQUIRED.
The Directors of the Bank have been much impressed with the great and sub-
stantial developments of Western Australia, which they are confident will continue.
This opinion is based not only on the general progress of the State, but on the increased
volume of new business offering, and the growing demands for accommodation by the
Bank’s customers.
In order that this new business shall be handled effectively, more capital is required,
and the Directors have accordingly obtained authorisation for the issue of 200,000
£1 shares. They have decided, however, to call for applications for 50,000 £1 shares
at a premium of £1 10s. each, providing the Bank with £125,000 new funds.
DIVIDENDS.
Whilst in no way making any promise or guarantee in connection with future
dividends, the Directors are of opinion there will not be any difficulty in distributing
profits to the extent of 16| per cent, on the existing capital of £300,000, together with
the new T capital now being sought.
Dividends will be payable in any Australian capital, Auckland, Wellington,
Dunedin, or London, free of exchange. Dividends will be payable half-yearly in May
and November. All New Shares will participate in dividends declared on and after
November, 1923.
APPLICATIONS FOR SHARES.

“Harold Hardupp”: They built well in the
old days. Made entirely of Australian tim-
ber, the coach which runs between Gosford
and Mangrove Creek (N.S.W.) has only
another two years to go to complete a cen-
tury of service. And the proprietor reckons
that there is a lot of work in the old shay
yet.
Wilson’s handy little Sydney and Suburban
Street Directory has made its 1923 appear-
ance, and is so complete that with it a
gentleman from Coonabarabran could leave
a lodge meeting at Turramurra at 2 a.m.
and find his way to Bill’s place at Tempe
like a homing bird. And the supplemental
guide makes of the Blue Mountains an open
book.
“Cod”: Bill Bung is a funny old cove
sometimes. At a meeting of the Brisbane
L.V.A. one speaker began with the boast
that he had not tasted his own tonic for 16
long, dry years. Imagine the shoe-traders
inviting a man to speak up for them who
would open proceedings by wiggling his bare
toes and taking credit for never having had
leather round them !
“Yardley”: “Stony” suggests that the
year’s supply of apples should be so aver-
aged as to allow retailing at threepence a
pound the year through. That might be
rendered possible if growers would hark
back to the old custom of storing. Straw
was spread upon logs to provide a platform
in the orchard : the fruit was heaped upon
the platform and the storehouse thatched
over and covered with earth. The rough-and-
ready method might cause some loss of the
fruit, but, since no transport was paid upon
unsaleable portions of it, this was no great
matter.
“Pantagruel”: “Adelaide” (B. l/2/’23)
talks about the wanderings of The Bulle-
tin in the South, and asks how it gets along
in the North. Well, it arrives at Brisbane
on Thursday, and there radiates out to sub-
distributing centres, Charleville and Rock-
hampton being the most important. Leaving
Rockhampton on Friday night it goes up to
Macknv, thence by boat to Townsville, Cairns
and Thursday Island, which last it reaches
about eight days from publication. From
Rockhampton it also goes to Longreach, get-
ting to that place on Sunday. Beyond Long-
reach it now goes to many places by air.
“Uramao”: An interesting little party is
visiting Maoriland. Under the care of Mr.
Thomson, a Chatham Islands school-teacher,
and accompanied by five adults, seven boys
and seven girls from Maoriland’s small de-
pendency are the guests of the Canterbury
School Committees’ Association, and have
been gazing on metalled roads, railway
trains, motor-cars and bikes for the first
time. The different towns are showing them
everything possible before they depart again
for their island home. But before that hap-
pens it looks as if the astonished youngsters
will have to wear safety-pins in their eye-
lids.
“E.”: Vance Palmer, who plays cricket
with a Dandenong Ranges team, used to be
a good bat in Bananaland a dozen years ago,
before he was beguiled into literature. With
the men of the mountains, splitters and cow
cockies, he came down to play the M.C.C.
on the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Imagine
his consternation when the mighty Warwick
Armstrong issued from the pavilion and led
his men into the field, mostly pennant
players! And, of course, Warwick w r ent on
to bowl, and kept on all through the innings.
The denouement seems in the worst style of
American fiction, for Vance stayed in for an
hour and a half and made top score. “I’ll
never have such success nerain, in literature
or anything else,” he said sadly, when at
last he retired. “I’ve had my day.”
“Randolph Rentless”: There are a good
many German marks in Sydney, and a few
speculators are still gambling in what looks
very much like worthless paper. One man
I know purchased 180,000 marks for £3,
sold 80,000 of them for £2, buying another
100,000 with the purchase money. At this
point the mark began to slither downhill
faster than ever, but he keeps a brave heart,
pointing out that he stands to lose very
little, and that if Fritz’s currency should
ever swing back to anything approaching
its old value he has a fortune in his hands—
unless, w T hile he is waiting, the rats eat
the paper. In Sydney, by the way, is a
woman whose mother made £9OOO by the
s'mple nrocess of buying Russian roubles
at a ha’penny each after the Crimean War,
and waiting for the return to normal.
“Thorndon” : You might have called Stout,
C.J., and Ballanee, one-time Premier of
M.L., the unheavenly twins. Both unbe-
lievers in any sort of religion; both anti-
booze and anti-gambling, and both abstainers
from all the other vices that make life worth
living. And David and Jonathan were
strangers compared with them. When Bal-
lance was preparing for the operation under
which he died, Stout (not then in Parlia-
ment) came from Dunedin to be with him.
Ballanee had everything in order, with
Stout’s assistance; shook hands, bade a
chancy farewell, and went into the room from
whence he was carried in a cofiin. He in-
tended Stout to succeed him as Premier, but
Seddon, who was Acting-Premier, jumped
the job, and although Stout got a seat, he
remained nobody until Seddon, apprehensive
of such a big derelict floating about in the
political cove, anchored him as Chief Justice.
“Gaza’s” tale of luck: —
“The room should be swept out before the
members arrive,” complained a Hyde Park club-
man to me, as I shared a morning seat with him.
“Makin’ a man shift just as he gets comfortable,”
he continued, glancing menacingly at the approach-
ing path-sweeper. He stuck to his seat, after I’d
left for the grass, till he was an island in a
sea of scraps, butts and peelings. Suddenly there
was a scuffle between them, and I got over just
in time to adjudicate. They’d been struggling for
sixpence that they’d seen simultaneously in the
litter. The sweeper had secured the prize, but,
on my suggestion, agreed to toss for it. My
friend called “ ’eads” and won. After congratula-
tions and settling down again, he surprised me
with: “Eh, mister, ’ow about puttin’ another
one to it, so’s I can get a good feed?” Seeing
my reluctance, he warmed up and pleaded; “You
won’t spoil me good luck will yer? This one's
got two ’eads!” I parted, and he gleefully hurried
off in quest of sustenance.

The superiah critic of Shakspeare, who
consider!, all scenery a device for distracting
attention from the text, will probably find
some cause for complaint in the Ascbe ver-
sion of “Julius Caesar” at Melbourne
Majesty’s. Ascbe doesn’t employ scenery in
the ordinary meaning of the term, but bis
artful simplicity,. expressed in a deep, twilit
stage, with a series of rich backgrounds
showing cypresses, columns and housetops in
enchanting silhouette, is not less insidious
in its beguilement than the most sumptuous
productions of the past. Of course, it is
all very impressive, and distinctly sugges-
tive of the school whereof the German pro-
ducer Reinhardt is the preponderating influ-
ence ; a conspicuously Reinhardtian touch is
the emergence of the Roman mob from the
bowels of the stage to demonstrate in ter-
races of waving arms. But unless the actors
have the personalities to compel indifference
to the colorful symbolism of puce and violet
nights, not to mention the significantly ruby
glow which bathes the Senators during the
murder of Caesar, the performance remains
a triumph for the limelight man.
After due consideration of all the aspects,
the present referee is inclined to grant the
limelighters the verdict on points. The fact
is that Asche’s company, including himself,
is not strong enough to compete in popular
interest with the effusive novelty of the
representation. Some are good but not
great, and the best doesn’t induce a gracious
flow of superlatives. In the matter of clear
and vigorous speech George Ide, as Cassius,
seems the most striking, and the tall and
commanding figure of Cecil Humphreys
serves nobly for Brutus, though there are
hard and featureless, periods of speech in
which he doesn’t count at all. lan McLean
strives to achieve by greasepaint the ingrow-
ing cheeks of Caesar-. He has a convincing
Roman nose, and he maintains, without any
apparent effort, an unspectacular but im-
perious tone of utterance to the finish. Oscar
Asche brings to the part of Antony a sense
of the grandiose which has been amply indi-
cated by Nature, and it is, therefore, obvi-
ous that from the start the character is dis-
qualified on the ground of physical impro-
priety. But he is not too dreadful in the
Forum scene. His bold, bravura methods
can be imagined as scoring some dramatic
effect on the fickle Roman mob. But where
he errs is in over-emphasising the tributes
to liis personal magnetism, as if he were a
spellbinder instead of a plain, blunt man.
The notion of making the multitude assail
him with decayed vegetables for the plea-
sure of theatricalising the contrast between

“Ambrose Applejohn’s Adventure” quickly
built up a reputation at Melbourne King’s,
and most people who don’t thirst for music,
singing, dancing or a bedroom scene in an
evening’s entertainment are going to see
Applej. One has laughed before at some-
thing like this, but never at quite the same
thing. The dream has a humor of its own.
\Vhen the unconquerable Pirate King stacks
his long knife up to the hilt in the plump,
juicy stummick of his perfidious first mate
the success of the comedy is assured. That
disappearing blade might have been conven-
tional half-a-century ago, but it is horribly
funny to-day, and the absurdity of it har-
monises with the ultra-mellowdramatic be-
havior of Diana Wilson and her bogus Bol-
shevik in the first act. Diana’s weird
manner of skating on to the stage with
bended knees prepares one for any amazing
thing that follows. Her entrance is the last
word in conventional melodrama, whilst the
clicking of Ashton Jarry’s heels has the
genuine ring of satire on military guff. A
spirit of irony pervades the whole upset in
the Applejohn household. For this reason,
perhaps, the comedy makes least appeal to
the amphitheatre. The amphitheatre mostly
has a rooted objection to an irony that takes
it unawares, and pulls its leg if it isn’t
watching.
The last nights of Fullers’ panto., at Mel-
bourne Palace, will, seemingly, be prolonged
until builders, painters and decorators insist
on carrying out their contract. The panto,
is really too profitable to be hustled off, but
as the theatre has to get furnished with a
new interior by Easter these last nights of
Dick Whittington must shortly end.

“The O’Brien Girl” goes dancing down the
•avenue of time at
Melbourne Prin-
cess’s as a matter
of course. Nobody
knows exactly how
many factors went
to the making of
the O’Brien Boom,
but anybody will
swear to two of
them —the glori-
ously active chorus
which includes
even a mercurial
contingent of male
choristers, and the
domestic differ-
ences of the
Drexels. May
Beatty and Mark
Daly have become
friends of the
public. Mark’s in-
surrection, which
May so tactfully
suppresses, is one
of those true things
that all the world
dismisses in jest
and no individual
forgets to talk
about afterwards.

At Melbourne Gaiety this evening (Thurs-
day) Allen Doone is to drop iUun.e Bawn
and start dooning in “Old Donegal.” All
this time the gallant Irish patriot, acushla,
insists on limiting his charges to even money.
Instead of 4s. 4d. for instance, he charges
only 4s. In short, to quote the stirring
words of the advt., “Doone pays the tax.”
No matter how often one buys a seat, Doone
pays the tax, the sly divil!

Dorothy Murdoch and Alberto Zelman,
two distinguished Australians who have been
roaming, are to reappear, on Saturday at
Melbourne Town Hall, where a sobful Italian
tenor has lately challenged diverse criticism.
Dorothy Murdoch is a contralto, dear to Mel-
bourne ere she went to Europe, while
Alberto Zelman has the proud Decul arity of
being the most generally admired and lbast
often heard of Australian violm soio.sts. At
Saturday’s welcome-home concert, too, a
protege of Melba, J. D. Brownlee, will sub-
mit a sample of the Voice he is taking to
Europe for further cultivation.
“Love Never Dies” is the reigning effusion
at Melbourne Majestic. The leading charac-
ters are well handled by Madge Bellamy and
Lloyd Hughes, but the plot, with Egyptian
trimmings, will be found inscribed on a
brick in Tutankhamen’s tomb at Luxor.
Vivian Martin is a fresh and invigorating
jest in the humorous follow-on, “Pardon My
French.” “Manslaughter,” at Hoyt’s, opens
with a few scenes of gaiety that fail to bring
a blush to a roue's cheek. But the main
interest of the tale lies in a prosecuting
attorney’s wild affection for the angel he has
helped to send to gaol for three years.
Audible sympathy with the great man almost
drowned the gurgles of Hoyt’s mechanical
orchestra on Saturday night. At the Bri-
tannia “The Great Lover” finds pantomime
inadequate to express his horror at the fail-
ure of his voice. The Melba has William
Farnum at home in “Moonshine Valley.”
* * * *
“ ’Possum Paddock,” Kate Howarde’s old
selection, is back in Sydney—at the Opera
House—and with Fred McDonald as “Dad”
McQuade’s son Billy, it is certain to appeal
to the multitude that likes its jokes made
obvious. And there is plot enough in it, too,
to draw you back after the interval —good
Backblocks plot, with hard times and soft
hearts and a flinty bank-manager in it.
George Cross and S. A. Fitzgerald are other
members of the cast who keep well in the
picture; and the reception on Saturday night
was hearty enough to bring Miss Howarde
forward —she had played a city widow —with
a promise that she would shortly let tw r o
other xlustralian dramas out of the bag.

At Sydney Palace, Nicola, conjurer, illu-
sionist, prestidigitator, would make a pro-
fessor of political economy rub his eyes and
doubt his senses. A master of his own subtle
and entertaining craft, he is no less success-
ful in impersonating other famous magicians,
the “Chinese” Ling Soo, the Hindu Hassan
Bux, an Egyptian specialist in sorcery and
an Argentine necromancer, and in presenting
their brain-bewildering feats in the garb
and setting proper to each. There seem to
be no chains or handcuffs welded that could
hold Nicola, and when he is finally discovered
sewn up in a sack inside of a trunk in the
precise position in which he has himself just
previously immured and locked and corded
an accommodating lady, the audience just
gasps and the old mango-tree trick sinks to
the level of thimblerigging. There is genuine
cleverness in some of the subsidiary items,
notably the shadowgraphing of Ibex and the
lightning cartooning of Wagnar.

At Sydney Theatre Royal Louis Bennison
has discarded the Florentine trappings of.
“Benvenuto” and quit specialising in the
Art and love and gay revelry and dashing
swordsmanship of the Medicean period.
Louis is portraying “The Great Lover”
again, his master character in the realm of
amorous romance, and the revival has seven
more nights to run before he will tear him-
self away from his impassioned admirers.

Emelie Polini and Frank Harvey are still
providing full-flavored domestic emotion,
arising out of rushingly impossible situa-
tions, at Sydney Cri. There is plenty of
kick in “The Flaw” for those who like to
see a strong spirit going off pop in its agony.
“Sally” continues to deliver the goods at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, with the melodious
accompaniments that musical comedy de-
mands. Josie Melville remains the last word
in dainty dancing, and Grade Layers is an
undeniably fetching piece of femininity.
This week Sydney Tivoli has two head-
liners in comedy on its bill of fare. G. P.
Huntley has a subtle artistry of his own,
and his “Wallpapers” is almost a classic.
Bert Madison, on the other hand, seems to
have assimilated much that has been pur-
veyed before, by Carney, Rickaby and
others. His seedy Woodbine “one pip” turn
squeezes a laugh from the audience, mainly
because of his dilapidated make-up and
shambling gait. His other items, though
tolerable, are not so good. Eric Godley, a
baritone who sings resonantly, is supported
indifferently by Rosa Walton. Moon and
Morris, who can generally be relied upon to
dig up fresh jokes, fall by the wayside in
an ancient sketch. Other Musgrove assets
are Vida Sutton, The City Four and the
Geaiks.
* * :■= *
Sheiks are the new screen idols of the
flappers at the moment, so “The Sheik’s
Wife,” who conducts her intrigues at Syd-
ney Lyceum, is going to be widely hated.
The lady doesn’t submit so passively as the
flapper thinks a sheik’s wife should. She
gives “Eggs-a-cook” a rough spin, and reduces
him to the level of any henpecked hubby.
Apart from a descent into old ruts occa-
sionally, "The Bond Boy,” which also runs
at the same house, travels along agreeably
through salty tears to a dry finish. “Little
Italy” has taken its naturalisation papers
out at the Strand. The flicker is a hectic
romance of blood feuds, lightning marriages
and jamborees in N’York’s colony of
“Wops.” “Dream Street,” D. W. Griffith’s
latest, is at the Crystal Palace. It intro-
duces the slum area of London and is gorged
with what the ad.-man calls the “human in-
terest factor.” Griffith’s flair for elaborate
settings is prominent. “Manslaughter” con-
tinues its somersaults at the Globe, to the
bewilderment of those “fans” -who have never
before seen a good-bad heroine and a bad-
good hero. A parody on “Blood and Sand”
is at the Crystal Palace. Hoyt’s come to the
front with an Americanised “Omar Khay-
yam” ; but it makes a gorgeous picture.

The star of the first-time-in-Australia
show promised at Adelaide Royal turns out
to be Lady Forbes Robertson, whom manager
Myers has secured for the first Saturday in
March. The Williamson panto, at this
house is a joyous interlude, strong on every
side except the vocal. There is a wealth
of color, and the dancing—solo or combined —
is great. Daisy Yates, Mona Magnet and
Rene Barlee all score well in their strongly-
contrasting ways. At the Majestic. Dal-
beanie shows himself a powerful “equilibrist,”
and Martini is doing an acrobatic turn in
front of the screen at West’s. Huxham’s
Serenaders have strengthened their pro-
gramme by dropping in Hector St. Clair, and
Dampier now includes Alf Lawrance m a
medley of his own compositions. Pictures
are mostly good people in moderate
Tom Moore and Jack Pickford at West s,

Meldrum, who has
obviously influenced
the artist, could not
have painted the pic-
tures more sincerely.
The still life of pink
rose before a pink silk
curtain is as interest-
ing in its realism as
the striking association
between a cloisonne
ornament and a piece
of gold brocade. Far-
mer’s landscapes are
equally Simple and
direct. Souvenirs of
travel in Japan are a
“Misty Morning, Ky-
oto,” a capital repre-
sentation of a dim
yellow umbrella and a
ghostly gate, and
“M ell in g Snows,
Nikko,” which seems
to be almost ostenta-
tiously artless, like
“The Sacred Bridge”
and “Nanenji Park”
(Nos. 13, and 14).
The portraits are
limited to four, No. 30
being unconventionally
honest in its depiction
of a plain woman’s facial failings. The self-portrait
(No. 29) is less successful, and the full-length view of
a lantern-jawed young man, with a purposefully
clenched fist contradicting the blankness and indeci-
sion of the countenance, is not so good as a head of
the same model wherein the features are less dis-
dainfully treated.
Claude and Graham Swinton-Diston make a
moderate impression with their forty-five pictures
at the Vic. Artists’ Society. Graham is
only responsible for five modest landscapes, whereas
Claude varies the monotony of his green fields and
placid mornings with one or two unexciting portraits.
One old gentleman, with white, waving hair, is
labelled “The Anarchist,” but the writer has seen
wilder men moving a censure motion at a church
cricket-club meeting. “An Old Salt” deserves com-
miseration for the way the artist has mapped out
his features, and “The Widow” reminds one of a
fruity pantomime dame. The artist does best in
the study of the venerable organist whose long beard
seems to commemorate his irreproachable character.
* * *
After a visit to Hordern’s galleries:—
According to the S. M. llkrald, George Lambert,
A.R.A., in reviewing the need for a National School
of Art, wound up his remarks with this:—-“The
sculpturesque quality—modelling and volume —is
sadly lacking in most of the paintings turned out
by Australian artists. To achieve this quality I
myself have great trouble.” One does not wonder
at that if Mr. Lambert seriously seeks it, for even
Velasquez, Corot and the other great realists prob-
ably lost sleep worrying over it. But the Self
Portrait now on view at Anthony Hordern’s gallery
does not indicate that the sculpturesque quality is
anything of a nightmare to Mr. Lambert. It con-
tains a dressing gown that certainly has no body
in it, and the whole picture, apart from the head,
is as flat and lacking in projection as most of his
recent work. Indeed, volume of the kind which
gives the illusion of actual space in a picture—
which is how quite a number of Australian painters
see it, and the Old Masters understood it —is usu-
ally so negligible a quantity in Mr. Lambert’s work,
and his studied brush-strokes are so obvious, as
to suggest that he is far more interested in
technique for the sake of it than in the other
things that are more important in Art.
“O. Blin”: The most elderly Hamlet 1
ever saw was being inspected by George
Rignold and a couple of friends from the
back of the circle at a Melbourne theatre.
Hamlet was portly and old-womanish, but
the applause was fairly generous, though
Itignoid never lent a hand. Nor did he
make a comment that was audible until
Hamlet expired in the last act. Then one
of his pals said: “What do you think of
it, George?” The handsome one, groping
for his hat, sorrowfully murmured: “The
end of a perfect Dame!”
"Thorold”: The periodical search for a
grand-opera libretto. “British in sentiment
and written by a Briton,” is again in pro-
gress, the prize being 50 quid, and the
profferer the National Opera Co., to which
Australia’s recent song-fledglings have
flocked. Arnold Bennett is one of the
judges, and if a work of sufficient merit to
justify an award is received it will be sub-
mitted to a British composer. But no writer
with a reputation to lose will take on such
a contract for a distant prospect of 50
notes.

Nothing; Better in
WATCHES.
No watch can be better for hard bush use than
our celebrated “Super Fx. & R.” Watch.
After 81 years’ experience in every make of
watch throughout the world, we unhesitatingly
publish our opinion that there is no better, stronger,
more durable watch than the “Super Fx. & R.”
Watch.
Profoundly accurate, too. A “Super Fx. & R.”
Watch goes to within 10 seconds a month.
Then, too, they last a lifetime, and stand horse-
back rough wear better than any watch that we
know of.
Three-quarter plate Levers, with 15 jewels, they
are fine value when one considers that the Custom's
collect 48 per cent, of the cost price.

“William Street” : Discoursing—l hope in
a temporarily embittered mood—on the
American love for sermonising, “E.F.” (B.
8/2/’23) cites an instance in “Learn to
Smile,” the waltz melody of “The O’Brien
Girl.” What’s wrong with the exhortation,
anyway? Something may be said against the
melody, which is thin and catchy, but the
sentiment is a darned sight better than that
contained in many other ditties, English and
American. If you’ve got a melody, it’s bet-
ter to hitch it to learn-to-smile words than
to mush about faded violets. As for the
American love for preaching, our rich Uncle
is certainly a mighty preacher, but he’s not
the only one, by a long chalk. Take our own
“Sentimental Bloke.” Whenever Bill can
get a minute or two away from the plot of
the drama, he is contrasting the beauties of
country life with “the dirty, rotten city,”
or maundering about the responsibilities of a
father, or saying something else that every-
body knows and no one takes any notice of.
And we don’t blame Bill or Dennis for it,
either. Rather, we like it.
“G.”: There is talk in Melbourne of estab-
lishing a permanent opera company. The
notion would be all right if original works,
English and Australian, were to be pro-
duced ; but how can anybody get enthusias-
tic over an attempt, to resuscitate the old
Italian operas that are decently dead and
buried. A “national” opera co. without
national works seems a contradiction in terms.
A revival of old shockers like “Trovatore”
and “Traviata” that were <uit of date in
Ballarat 30 years ago would be unlikely to
produce anything except a musical riot.
“ BENVENUTO ,” AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Robt. E. Homans as Count
Strozzi, and Geo. Blunt
as Aurelio Ascolano.
“0.1 v.” In Oscar Asche’s “Southern Maid”
we get the ancient theatrical absurdity of two
or three people adopting a highly-colored
foreign accent, while fellow-citizens, reared
under the same conditions, talk plain Aus-
tralian because they belong to the broad
comedy section of the east. Gladys Mon-
crieff, as heroine, is a Santiago native who
makes foreign accent her speciality, and
Claude Flemming, as a picturesque Spanish
bounder, is conspicuously un-English. But
his two daughters, Mione Stewart and Nel-
lie Payne, who have the blood of the Fuegcs
in their veins, and have grown up in the
same street as Gladys Moncrieff, are as free
from foreignness as the two waiters at the
cafe, who might be a pair of Cockneys. The
rule in melodrama, seemingly, is for the
romantic characters only to use a spurious
exotic accent or idiom. The comic relief party
must invariably talk “straight,” the dialogue
requiring crude delivery of simple jests in
order to tickle the ears of simple hearers.
An expert opinion of “The Bloke” :
My friend Bluey, the property-man, gave me his
opinion of “The Sentimental Bloke” as a play. “It’s
a schlenter, all the way,” he said. “ ’Ere’s Mar’s
tidy little kipsy, so spruce that ’Erb’s gotter wipe
’is crabs on the mat afore they lets ’im in, an’
Mar ’erself’s as neat an’ clean as anythin’. An’
yet she ’andles a bar o’ soap, an’ then goes on mail-
in’ pastry without washin’ ’er dooks, altho’ the
sink an’ water’s all set like a jelly on stage. W’en
she’s done messin’ with the flour an’ dough, an’
puts away the gear, she still fergets to wash ’er
mitts. She lays the best Sunday table-cover, an’,
blime, in two shakes she puts the rabbits she buys
off Ginger on the bloomin’ company tablecloth as
if they was bokays. Unnat’ral, I calls it —jus’ like
they’ve got w’ite antimacassars an’ electric lights
workin’ together.
“An’ the langwidge! W’en did you, or Dennis,
or anybody alive ever ’ear the mob talkin’ about
‘doin’ a bunk’ ? Tl\,at’s plain cockney. The push
don’t do no bunk. They goes inter smoke, or does
a get, or makes a break, or guys a whack, or some-
thin’ like that. No wonder Mar can’t jerry to their
chat, though o’ course she’s such a dead mug she
don’t know what ‘bonzer’ means. But the worst
of all is the word ‘stretch’ they’re slingin’ yer all
night. The Kid (an* ‘Kid’s’ Yank) done Seven
days for stoushin’ a John, an’ everyone calls it a
‘stretch’ over an’ over again. A ‘stretch’ means a
year’s boob, nothin’ else. Seven days is seven days
a month’s a moon; three months is a drag; six
months is a sixer; an’ a year’s a stretch. Blime,
Dennis oughter do a bit of stir ’imself. That'd learn
’im.
“Dinkum, I like to see a Aussie author make a
monte of it, an’ come out ’oldin ; but if yer make
a * slang play, with a slang moniker, for Gorsake
stick to the bloomin’ Orstralian langwidge!”
“Lud”: “F.A.” may be excused for mix-
ing up the brothers
W right (B.
1./2/’23), for they
are all comedians
and all very much
alike, on and off
the stage. Fred
has a cosmopoli-
tan reputation, be-
ing as well known
on Paris and New
York stages as in
London’s West
End, but he has
never been on this
side of the world.
Huntley, the eldest,
is the veteran
laughter - provoker
at Daly’s, with
which theatre he
has been connected
off and on for
quarter of a cen-
tury. At present
he is gagging and
wheezing in “The
Lady of the Rose,”
which Tallis has
secured for early
production here. -It
“A Southern Maid,”
at Melbourne Royal.

tourist.
is one of Daly’s biggest winners.
“Whitebait” : “Good Gracious, Annabelle,”
with which Marie Tempest descended on
London (B. 8/2/’23), was presented in Aus-
tralia six years ago. It is the work of
Clara Kummer, a cousin of AVilliam Gillette,
who was the first to put Sherlock Holmes on
the stage. Clara, as a song-writer, got
unheard-of publicity, even for America, when
she produced the mushy ballad entitled
“Dearie.” Yankee critics of the stature of
George Jean Nathan have spoken enthusi-
astically of “Good Gracious, Annabelle!”
but to Australian and, it is reported, English
audiences the importance of the dahler, ex-
pressed through almost every character, be-
comes tedious. Miss Tempest declared Syd-
ney the limit in Gothic blindness. Judging
by the chilly reception accorded to “Anna-
belle” she probably now regards the Harbor
City as less barbarous than London, even
though she was born within ear-range of
Bow Bells.
“Fax”: “Good Gracious Annabelle” (B.
8/l/’23) left very little impression in this
country. Australia faintly remembers it as
something that happened, and that is all.
They were very light entertainments that
Marie Tempest travelled with. Though a
lot' of praise was lavished on the “artistic
finish” and “technical skill” of her easy act-
ing, and that of Browne, it may be ques-
tioned whether she would have long con-
tinued to be a much-talked-about actress in
England, or here, if her name had not some-
how got confused with Marie Lloyd’s. The
music-hall Marie was a great advt. for the
older lady.
“Peanut”: “Up Stage” (B. S/2/’23) com-
plains that he has never heard of G. H.
Muleaster, who is coming to Australia under
Hugh Ward’s flag'. I remember seeing Mul-
easter in 1919 at the St. Martin’s, London,
in "The Very Idea,” and though not a great
l.ght. even then he was considered of sufficient
eandlepower to be bracketed in large type
with Donald Calthrop and Mary Glynne.
The lesser stardust included Stephen Ewart
(here with Ethel Irving). Muleaster im-
pressed me as a sound actor with an easy
style and a fine voice. His part called for
a perfect physical specimen as the male half
of a eugenic contract, and I allowed he
just filled the bill.
“Off Stage”: “Up Stage” (B. 8/2/ T 23) is
ill-informed. I saw Muleaster as the hero in
“The Land of Promise” (Irene Vanbrugh
was principal woman) at London’s New
Theatre in 1917. “Dot” Boucicault was
manager. Muleaster also created the part
of returned soldier in Barrie’s original pro-
duction of “The Old Lady Shows Her
Medals” at the same theatre. He was like-
wise the naval officer in the same author’s
“Seven Women,” Irene Vanbrugh being one
of the Seven.
“Santander”: Two figures interest me in
“The Southern Maid,” at Melbourne Royal.
One is the arrch-English jolinnie, Harry Hil-
liard, who, at the moment when the alleged
vendetta threatens to culminate in a ten-to-
one brawl, insists on recording the incident
with his kodak. In other roles Hilliard re-
vealed no personality worth mentioning, but
here he is accurately fitted to a part in which
a silly-ass chortle embellishes his Scotch
helping of dialogue. The other personage is
the swaggering conspirator, Robert Chisholm,
who shows off a square foot of naked chest
as if it were the noblest work of God. Seeing
that his companions in crime are cloaked
right up to the tonsils, Chisholm’s hairy
dccolletS is uncalled for. It adds nothing
to the picture and is merely luring many a
wandering eye which would be better em-
ployed elsewhere.
“Lucio” : “Harry Benhain, the best Pooh-
Bah I ever saw,” says “L.ILP.”(B. 8/2/’23).
I concur. Every other Australian Pooh-Bah
known to me clowned the part. Benham,
a large, moist-eyed, heavy-lipped man, played
it seriously, and you saw satire where com-
peting mummers only showed you horse-
collar jokes. When Benham died, many an
old theatre-goer was startled to learn that he
was one of the Barrington brothers. Harry
Barrington was Rickards’s stage-manager at
the Tivoli for years, and a dashing ballad
singer.
“G.”: Two of the best actors in “Cairo”
are the camels, though they give their most
interesting performance in Little Bourke.
Every evening just after eight they make
their way to the theatre with an admiring
crowd of kids about them. It is a most im-
pressive scene, showing Asche at his best.
In the play they enter and exit in about
three seconds. How about introducing the
dromedaries among the Roman proletariat
at Antony’s oration ? They could do tricks
while Oscar was getting his second wind.
A Maorilander settles it: —
Irving Sayles didn’t die in bed (“Dido,” B.
11/l/’23), nor did he “drop dead in Wellington in
front of his theatre” (“The Deacon,” 18/l/’23). lie
dropped dead in Gloucester-street, Christchurch, at
noon on Feb. 8, 1914, just outside the Dominion
Hotel, where he was staying. He had been appear-
ing at the Opera House with a Fuller show. Death
was due to a clot of blood, which had forced itself
into a main artery, and Sayles never spoke after the
seizure.
“P. Le L.”: Eric Howell (B. 4/l/’23)
once drifted into the N.S.W. mining camp in
which I abode (it was also called Howell),
and donned the sweat-rag in the capacity of
“tapper.” His outbursts of elocution, de-
livered at crib-time, were almost as popular
as the two-up school. The males of the vil-
lage voted him a good sort, and the girls
went crazy about him —at least, mine did.
He ultimately persuaded 20 of us miners to
transform ourselves into the Howell Enter-
tainers, and avenge old injuries on neigh-
boring towns. It is years s.nce Eric struck
his tent for the effete metropolis, but he is
still kindly remembered round about Inverell.
“Fax”: At Melbourne Tivoli, a lady wear-
ing skin-tights is otherwise clothed in colors
thrown upon her seductive person by lantern-
slides. And the programme says she is ap-
pearing in “an original and novel color-
blending act, as the Venus of Flowers.”
Where is the novelty? The lantern has been
doing likewise with human Venuses for ages.
I remember Mary Weir in a butterfly dance,
the butterflies being cast on her clothing
by a lantern, and I recall other tighted
forms divine being bathed in gaudy reflec-
tions from colored slides. Vaudeville history
delights in repeating itself.
“Blaekfriars” : Got a shock the other day
when presentments of Charles* Haw trey
looked down affably from the Melbourne
hoardings as Ambrose Applejohn. It turned
out that the posters had come all the way
from Brummagem. It must be disconcerting
to playgoers and to Grossmith himself to find
that the man on the stage is not the same
as in the pictures. The psychological effect
on the local printers is another consideration.
“Thor”: Asche was mounting “Julius
Caesar” in the demi-semi-Shakspearean mode
when he was tackled by Australia’s most
opinionated painter. “That second-act set
of yours was rotten, Asche,” declared the
color-juggler. “You ought to liven it up a
bit. Stick a couple of Roman urns in the
foreground somewhere, and you’ll bring the
effect up quite a lot.” “Yes,” snorted Oscar,
“and, if it’d help, I’d be willing, to put your
mortal remains in one of them.”
“T.W.”: Dropped his baton for good in
the Mirk recently, John Crook, known in
Australia as chief conductor for George Mus-
grove’s shows. Crook was one of the most
accomplished orchestral bosses ever seen
here —after Cowen, probably the best of
them. A anan of the all-round Meyer Lutz

Fred McDonald' as Bill McQuade complain-
ing that some coir has pinched his scanty
soap.
type, he composed light music for “Peter
Pan” and “Pantaloon.” “The Lady Slavey”
was also his.
“Tlior”: Melb. baritone Fred Collier (B.
8/2/’23) had a bit of luck in being chosen
to do the drunken father in Humperdinck’s
“Hansel and Gretel” when the fairy opera
was produced by Britain’s National Opera
Co. The part is a grateful one, and there
were sufficient performances to let Collier
and wife Elsie Treweek, as the mother,
shine a little through the Smoke. The
Times gives them both a friendly pat. Inci-
dentally, Maggie Teyte, who used to be a
lyric soprano beloved of Paris u»id London,
seems to have descended in the singing scale,
for she did the essentially mezzo-contralto
role of the boy Hansel.
“S.T.S.”: The U.S. tragedy of the
“Robots” (B. 18/l/’23) is not crude melo-
drama, though horrible enough. A friend
who has seen it tells me of a touch which
seems to suggest insight, possibly genius,
behind the writing. It is in that grim final
scene, where the highly-trained automata
have turned on the human race and all but
exterminated it, and “the last half-dozen
humans, surrounded and helpless, are seen
awaiting their doom.” One of the scientific
men looks calmly out of a window on the
advancing hordes of men-machines. Then he
says, with a slight shudder: “I wish we
hadn’t made their faces all alike.”
“J.H.” (Lond.) : The modern version of
“Polly” at the Kingsway Theatre is very
simply mounted and produced. For all that
it is in for a run rivalling the two years’
record of “The Beggar’s Opera,” still going-
strong at Hammersmith. The quaint old
operas have been licked into shape by Fred-
erick Austin, who wrote the music; Clifford
Bax, who re-wrote the text; and Nigel Play-
fair, the producer; and I firmly believe
these brilliant Englishmen have administered
the coup de grace to the showy vulgarities
of Yankee revue. Lilian Davies (Polly) is
an artistic singer, a delightful actress and
a really beautiful woman. Adrienne Brune,
an Australian girl, is bracketed with Lilian
by the Stab critic, who describes them as
“real discoveries.”
“Orb”: Recent P. Pointed reference to
diminutive Bertie Wright reminds me of the
piquant Yorkshire relish which flavored the
little man’s off-stage speech. I was in a
Melbourne bar when Bertie was introduced
to another comic of some avoirdupois as “Mr.
Wright, principal comedian of the J. C. Wil-
liamson Co.” The midget himself immedi-
ately supplemented this with “I get five short
of 50 every week. Think I’m worth it?”
His portly rival looked down at him
patronisingly. “Five short of 50,” lie said.
“Ah —er —shillings, or —er- —nuts?” Tom
Tluimb countered instantly with “No; beans.
Er —how do they pay you—hay or —er —
thistles?” And honors were even.
THE TOE-DANGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A dancer comes, the queen of them;
And, like a lily on its stem,
She tiptoes where the lights are high;
A bird, a bloom, a butterfly.
Snow-chaste she seems ; a cluster white
Of lilac blooming in the night;
A folk-lore song, a mystic rune;
A rhyme, a vision and a tune.
See her across the spaces pass,
Like pale flames starting in the grass;
Her steps so delicate that they
May brush the gnat, but will not slay.
A mirage faint, a star of hope,
A slim white crane, an antelope.
The sweet and better part she shows
Of all the graces nature knows.
She falls like snow, aiid she aspires
Like some hot star with flaming fires.
A clash; a rally. Vanished, ?h e
Takes with her one night’s gaiety.

world’s greatest inventor.
Electrically controlled throughout, this
machine represents mechanical perfec-
tion—an undoubted advance on any
other machine on the market — yet,
when it conies to price, you will find
our quotation pleasingly less.
Two persons doing'
one person’s work.
That’s inefficient, isn’t it? So why should
it take two persons to originate a letter —
when a dictator can choose his own time,
never wait for a stenographer, and speak
faster and better to the Ediphone—the
genuine Edison Dictation Machine?
You can dictate all your correspondence
while the ideas are fresh in your head, whether
early in the morning or late in the afternoon.
You can handle twice the amount of
correspondence with half the trouble.

M.M. (Q.) : You’re wrong; Ballantine was
leading counsel for the Claimant in the great case —
it lasted over a hundred days. The criminal case
was a small, sudden affair; the charge was perjurv
committed in the other suit A.C.M.; But that
writer didn’t say anything about starting wars, lie
said, “you can only carry on war under democracy
by persistently lying to the people.”. .. .S.C.: “In-
somnia” is unredeemed by a single apt epithet or
robust rhyme F.C.8.: Both miss; but have
another shot. . . .T.L.W.: Similar items already para-
graphed W.0.1C.D.: Hardly worth it A.W.:
Will probably illustrate “Incompetent” joke.... Mar;
We’ll take the cutlet, but have no use for the frill.
. ...0.M.: Let the clock sing;—
This simple structure, with its rethoric click click
click,
How akin to all, the strong the weak and the sick,
lo the rich and the great, the undesirable or saint,
time measures all, and brings with it fate.
In a Castle or a Cottage it articulates the same, it
points us the hours we never can regain.
To the philosopher the dunder-head or saint,
measured all alike by its rethoric quaint.
Time has crumbeled great nations, and has made
miniature ones great;
Time has leveled the Dynasts, the rich and the
great, to a simular dust that a pauper doth make.
Time moulds the minds of both the weak and the
jg great;
Time may endear, or time may estrange, but time
will level a mountain range,
Time’s a pilot to the human mind, time’s a theatre
that proves the true Kind.
. ...1.A.F.: It’s a ponderous mass of words woven
about a story that is not worth six lines... ,M,W.
(Rusheutter’s Bay): Insane as a story; but might
make a stage thrill M.M. (Bendigo): Millions
of people have thought the making of a bad pudding
was the making of a good story, blit iiohe of them
have proved it J.S.R.: No use Cox: Yarn 10
good and telling poor J.F.K.: Neither of them
up Y.U.: “Big Red” is not' bad of its kind,
but this is not the market for it. ...Stella M.!
The penitence doesn’t seem a good brand, but
the statement that “all that glitters is net gold
but very often tin” is interesting. Sometimes,
alas, it’s an empty bottle A.D.A.8.: Must go
back Yarcott: “Dad” has been Worked to death
in that attitude. Is every Australian father a.
hopeless idiot? W.M. (Leichhardt): The spider
crawls, heavily M.C.D.: Don’t care for “Bluff-
stakes”. .. .T.W.0.: Commonplace ideas in poor verse
....Sandyc: None Well enough done... .Bellerive: It
has the real nippy feeling of the morning air:—
My duties for my master
I was never known to shirk,
But, "tis deuced tough, in weather rough,
To rise at five for work.
I bustle off for all I’m worth,
And give the door a slam,
Hurry on in caliii or storm
To catch the early tram.
If raining hard the car is full,
*standeth like a gawk,
Vo shiver on the dummy edge,
Or face the brunt and walk.
The conductor dodges to and fro,
And gives the door a slam—
The job is not a rosy one
Upon a crowded tram.
.....Jocas: When people use other people’s methods
they generally contrive to get nearly level with them
at their worst AV.J.B.: Too many ruts in it....
M. : Nothing like a sonnet .C.M.R.: Terrible.
....Sarah W.: Doesn’t amount to anything. .. .G.R.
(Richmond) : Bad verse Vara: They just say the
old things and don’t say them very we 11.... Over-
lander: Highly moral sentiments wickedly expressed.
. ...F.G.8.: Wanted a lighter touch.... Betty B.:
No yarn there. .. .John S.: Worse than it was before.
. ...J.8.F.: Even the most ravenous “butterfly”
doesn’t deserve to be hymned like that D.P.M.:
All of them too weak R.C.M.A.: “The Universal
Lover” is thin and in bad shape.. . .Elsie B.: Poor.
Hotspur: They filled us with grief R.C.M.:
Wooden verse about a 5ku11.... C.M.: (Undercliffe) :
Not enough interest P.8.P.: “The Settler” can’t
find a selection here J.R. (Bargo) : The sketch
has a little color, but is too wild and incoherent ....
E.F.M.: A good idea ; but the verse is out of tune.
. ...M.8.P.: Can’t see how any person or thing can
be a “reaper of the way we wend.” You can reap
lucerne or whiskers, but ways defeat even the most
deadly barber.... King K.: The ghost doesn’t move
u 5.... Rosa R.: All miss. The themes demand good
workmanship and the metre is all over the place....
Caesar: Thin ideas in poor verse... .U.W.C.: Too
rugged.... A.W.: In the midst of all our worrows
and the hurrow of civilisation it came as a refresh-
ing breeze: —
Life is too short to worrow,
harts are too tuff to brake;
easy said “Take no thought of to-morrow.”
when your home and happyness is at stake.
friend you call them. They’re after your treasures
when they come falsely smiling in your face;
they want all from you, sheep, pleasures,
• not your sorrow and your displaying grace,
all what they want from you is money;
they call you a friend and by name; ,
treasure and pleasure your friends are many,
but they won’t take care of your fame.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
8.W.: Feeble. .. .F.A.: Even if it were original
it would be pretty bad... .F.K.K.: No use anyway.
. ...A.D.: Suspiciously un-Australian look about it.
. ...R.M.: Bad drawing and unimpressive idea....
N. : Misses. .. .J.L. : A blotchy atrocity....
C.McK.: She might be beautiful if you didn’t make
the poor girl squint... .J.M.: Not quite up....N.J.:
A lot of trouble for such a puerile gag....R.M.:
Drawing not quite up, and joke 01d....T.H.: As
usual.
Something less than a year ago The
Bulletin gave its blessing to a little job
the Australian Inland Mission is doing at
Carnarvon, the working centre of the most
remote and sparsely peopled district in Aus-
tralia. Now it gets this: —
May I say thanks to Bulletin readers for
their continued kindness in forwarding magazines
and papers for our bush-work up here? Last year
we were able to send out 4000 mags, and papers
in this way—and they were sent through a dis-
trict about as big as the State of Victoria. Of
these I estimate that about one half came from
Bulletin readers, and many are still coming. Their
response is splendid, and is appreciated both by
myself as the agent of distribution, and especially
by those outback to whom they are sent. Our work
here is carried on under the Australian Inland Mis-
sion, and from all our other stations literature is
sent out, though I believe Carnarvon heads the list
as regards quantity distributed. Of course, we
make no charge, even for postage, on what we send
out—it cost us £2O last year, but donations come
in from here and there which nearly covered it.

“Huffin Guffin”: Why do postal and rail-
way departments continue to use such high
telegraph poles? In the fenced railway lines,
particularly, sticks about 8 or 10 feet above
the ground should suffice. Thousands of old
poles cut off because they have gone at, or
just under, the point of contact with the
ground are lying about Australia. Each
represents 12 or 15 feet of good timber
wasted. And they were cut from the choicest
of young timber too.
* * * *
“Platman”: A Chinese gardener of Kil-
larney (Q.j took 11,4311 b. of tobacco leaf
off acres this season. He is the only
grower of tobacco there now, though before
Federation large quantities of leaf were
produced. Curious how the industry has
languished, considering the enormous import-
ation of leaf and the price at which the
manufactured article is retailed. Protective
duties should have meant a great expansion
in the acreage under tobacco; but Ivnibbs’s
figures show that the opposite has occurred.
“Harold Hardupp”: The increasing value
of the lease of a kiosk in the Sydney parks
reflects the tendency of rents to soar in a
bloated city. Twelve months ago the rent
of the kiosk near the Art Gallery was £l6O.
An extension of the lease was recently
granted at £350, and more would have been
got but for the City Council’s preference
for old tenants—the highest tenderer was
£416 per annum. The Botanical Gardens
kiosk has been re-leased to the previous
lessee at £750; but someone else was pre-
pared to give £832.
“Artifex”: To “F. Clinton’s” list of plant-
breeders (B. 25/l/’23) I would like to add
Dick Soutter, manager of Bungeworgorai
State Farm, Itoma (Q.). His father was
the manager of the Acclimatisation Soci-
ety’s Gardens in Brisbane. He is a disciple
of Farrer, and has produced crossbred wheats
unrivalled locally, such as Soutter’s Early,
Bunge and numerous others. His experi-
ments extend over 15 years, and he generally
has from 800 to 1200 new crosses every
year, which are tested and weeded out until
a promising one appears. He has also bred
a nematode-proof cow-pea, tried crossing the
native with the cultivated tobacco (to beat
the fungus curse) and is attempting a cross
of the native orange with the cultivated
orange—both flower in May, but the wild
orange has ripe fruits in December.

“V.C.”: A visit to most A.I.F. units at
mealtimes revealed an interesting variety of
cutlery and table appointments bearing the
crests and devices of restaurateurs from all
along the broad trail leading to the Western
Front. The excuse was dire necessity and
Scotch Q.M.’s. Still the practice of “bor-
rowing” table-ware from wherever it is acquir-
able isn’t a military specialty. A Melbourne
firm has just scheduled as missing from two
restaurants in twelve months; 210 serviettes,
160 butter-knives, 440 teaspoons, 110 sugar-
spoons, 300 pastry-forks, 97 salt-and-pepper-
shakers and 36 flower-vases. What with
waitress’s friends stoked at the boss’s ex-
pense, temperamental chefs and petty
larceny, I am beginning to see why we leave
the catering business to our Levantine
brothers.

“Simon”: The N. S. Wales Cremation
Society has almost completed its crema-
torium, and it will be interesting to watch
the effects upon “the trade.” Doubtless the
delivery hearse will remain, but it is cer-
tain that practical-minded cremationists
won’t stand the dyed feathers, frowsy frock-
coats, beer-stained plug hats and general
cadaverousness of a present-day funeral. It
looks, too, as if many of the hired offsiders
(7s. 6d. per planting, award rates) will get
a chance to look more cheerful. As for the
tombstone makers, everybody ought to be
glad to see them go. They are the worst
Australians in business. For a century
they’ve been dragging stub-nosed cherubim
and other raw material from nearlv every
country in Europe, while imperishable gran-
ite was homegrown, and Bowral (N.S.W.)
trachite fit to have bridged the centuries in
tomb was forgotten.
ERNEST’S REVOLT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Missing Persons. —The police are inquiring for
Ernest Hugh , 18, last heard, of in March,
1919, carrying a swag towards Milrose Plains,
N.S.W.”
Ernest pushed a pen at Jaggers’, counting up the
columns tall,
Till the figures jazzed like silhouettes upon a white-
washed wall. *
Eyes forever turning clockwards, Ernest trudged his
inky way,
Squelching through the mud of commerce, feeling
anything but gay.
Hating office work and bosses, Ernie’s fancy often
swept
Far beyond the counter’s confines, over hill and
plain, and stepped
Out along the dusty team-tracks, revelling in wind
and sun,
With Matilda for a cobber, heading for a cattle-
run.
Galled at last beyond endurance with the petty
tyranny
Of the office, Ernie seized his ledgers, tossed them
all with glee
Through the window, smashed the bundy, jiggered
up the office-stool,
Pulled the chief clerk’s long proboscis, banged young
Sniffkins with the rule.
Next he strode into the sanctum of old Jaggers,
fat and prim,
And in English, plain and colored, mentioned what
he thought of him.
Then, with all his shackles broken, and with free-
dom in the breast
That had only known repression, Ernest bolted for
the West!
Now un-collared, loosely trousered, all his days a
joyous song,
By the Western ways of wonder Ernest humps a
swag along.
Vainly are the John Hops seeking traces of the
missing one,
Poor but happy, Ern’s contented, heading westward
with the sun!

Herbert St. George Southey, who faded
out the other day in Kyneton hospital (Vic.),
claimed to be a descendant of the poet. For
40 years he lived at Drummond, a gold-
mining village of other days, and was near-
ing the 80th milepost when the call came.
“C.H.V.”: Talking about the right kind
of immigrant, what’s wrong with Mildura’s
daughter-settlement in S. Aus., Cadell? The
first land was taken up three years ago. and
to-day 60 soldier-settlers and their families
are in the area. Sixteen Diggers have mar-
ried since taking up their blocks, and 22
children have arrived, 10 of them during
last year. In three years only two deaths
have occurred.
Now that G. E. Marks, of Griffith
(N.S.W.), has been appointed assistant to-
bacco expert under the Vic. Agricultural
Department, Temple Smith, the chief man,
will leave for U.S.A. to pick tip the latest
wrinkles in culture and curing. The Gov-
ernment tried hard to keep him on the Closer
Settlement Board when he was there with
Mclvor and Moore, but he preferred super-
vising smokes in the raw.
“Stellsby”: I know a man who married,
begot three children, prospered, built a brick
house, paid for it, and fondly presented it
to his wife. She died intestate. The man
cannot realise on the property, as by law
he is entitled to only a third share, the other
two-thirds going to his children. It would
seem reasonable enough if the property was
the wife’s before marriage, but it is rather
rough on the widower who finds that his
own property doesn’t revert to himself.
“Wilfrido”: A recent entry for the Cool
Nerve Stakes is an Auckland (M.L,) citizen
who maintains a discreet silence as to his
present whereabouts. While the proprietor
of a little shop was in a back room the
other gentleman was burgling the till. At
that awkward moment a lady entered. With
exceeding courtliness, Sikes removed his hat,
excused himself for having had it on with
the plea that he was just about to go
out, served the customer, took payment,
pocketed the entire contents of the till and
faded out into the unknown.
E. J. Madden, of Frankston (Vic.), one
of the most artistic bookbinders in the Com-
monwealth, has retired after 50 years of
strenuous work. He used to toil for
George Robertson and Co., but in 1918 trans-
ferred to Walker, May and Co., which had
acquired the Robertson bookbinding busi-
ness. Madden’s dad and the late Chief
Justice Madden’s parent landed from the
same ship, and the two families lived for
a long time close to each other. And,
curiously, bar the difference in the initials,
the signatures of the C.J. and his old friend
are twins.
“Jesmond”: The Vic. Department of Agri-
culture has been patting itself on the back
for its efficient dairy-supervision ; but what
about the thousands of cows that do not
come under supervision, yet whose milk and
butter are consumed—cows milked for family
use and for boarding-houses and hotels? I
know one man who had been milking two
cows for years; during that time his wife
and two daughters contracted consumption.
A new dairy-supervisor saw the cows, and
being suspicious examined them. Both were
tuberculous. If the supervision was what
it ought to be such cases could not occur.
“Lou”: A good line worked by some of
the battlers in the far-out towns is making
tinware out of benzine and petrol “empties.”
With only a pair of snips, pliers, hammer
and a piece of hardwood for a square edge,
these craftsmen produce round crinkled
cake-tins, pattie-pans, seamless baking-dishes,
fancy flower-pots, candlesticks, and a lot of
small stuff such as soap-holders, egg-lifters,
etc. The round crinkled tins they turn out
rapidly, two at a time. I saw one pedlar
make six “patties” out of thin tin at one
turning, and he was a slashing good sales-
man, too. Out of two benzine tins he could
make up fourteen bobs’ worth of useful
articles and mostly sell them the same day.
“Sierra”: Has any South Pacific seaman
ever heard of the “graveyard watch”? Years
ago, when I earned my daily pantile rope-
hauling on the sad sea, a spell at the helm
or on the forecastle head in the yawning
hours from 4 to 6 a.m. was suggestively
named the “gravy-eye” wheel or look-out;
but the “graveyard watch” is new to me.
The term is used by Yankee writers to de-
note the middle watch on the romantic
schooners that carry them, in their quest
of raw life and hair-raising adventure,
amongst those highly decorous microcosms
known as the South Sea Islands. A few days
spent recently on one or two of the islands
set me longing for the wild unconventionality
of London or Sydney.
“Mr. Ocky”: Some of the British staff
officers attached to the A.I.F. early were
horribly punctilious about titles and' names.
Lieut.-Col. A. H. Bridges, who was at first
with the Bth Infantry Brigade and later
G.S.O. for the Ist Divvy, was one. Woe
betide the poor devil who wrote a “D. 5.0.”
before a “C.M.G.” or failed to indicate a
brevet rank. His big grievance against Aus-
tralians, however, was the way they referred
to a padre as “Captain” or “Major.” More
than once, I’ve heard him roar: “He’s not
a captain.’’ adding with a snort, “Anybody
but an Australian would consider, apart
altogether from the regulations, that the
title of chaplain is higher than that of
captain.” Still Bridges was a good fellow,
and I believe he loved the Digger.
H. H. Champion re a prolific naturalist:
The death of W. H. Hudson, who wrote some 22
books on bird and animal life in England and Pata-
gonia, has led to a proposal for the perpetuation of
the memory of a writer of great charm and wide appeal.
He was wretchedly poor when he began his nature
studies (his first book was published in 1885), and
at one time was granted a small Civil List Pension,
which he relinquished voluntarily when popularity
came to him. At a meeting of the departed
author’s friends and admirers, R. B. Cunninghame
Graham moved that subscriptions should be col-
lected to have Rothenstein’s portrait of Hud-
son presented to the National Portrait Gallery, and
that a stone memento should be placed in one of
the bird sanctuaries of the London parks. Any
moneys that remain over are to be devoted to the
preservation of wild-bird life. Mrs. E. B. Cham-
pion, of the Book Lovers’ Library, Melbourne, has
opened an Australian subscription list.

REX HAM PATE
because when served on Sandwiches it tastes
wondrously good. The mild Rex Ham is so
skilfully cooked by the Rex Chefs, then minced
so fine and seasoned so temptingly that it is
relished by everyone.
Rex Pate as a Sandwich spread is great for
little fellers , old “stagers”, and every age in
between.
Try it wherever the occasion calls for “different”

The King Came Home.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE mists that are as melted pearls were
in the green cup of the wood,
Which Morn had emptied of the
Night, and Life and High Em-
prise seemed good.
His war-horse champed its ringing bit to
hear them sound the tourney call.
And bravely to its jewelled sheath I heard
the sword of victory fall.
The white-throat sang against the copse,
the pennons on the blue were gay,
And with my favor in his heart and at his
helm he rode away.
The kine came home at even fall: I heard
them lowing in the byre ;
The sunset died along the hills in one wild
wave of orange fire ;
The hinds were talking of the jousts, of
blows for honor or for shame,
But when they told of gallant deeds not one
among them spoke his name.
I donned my robe of Heaven’s blue, I drew
my golden cincture down,
I set a jewel in my hair and underneath my
festal gown
My quilted petticoat I wore, my silken hose
with clocks of green,
For w r hen a king rides home at night ’twere
fitting he should find a queen.
A cricket in the grass was shrill; the whis-
pering wind was full of flowers;
The clatter on the high-road died; then came
the silent, moonlit hours.
Oh, surely, but he tarries long, weighed with
the laurels on his brow!
In triumph, does a king forget a woman
who is lonely now?
He rode not to my door, but came —too
slowly—by the secret trail.
There was no morion on his head, his throat
was bare, his cheek was pale.
Between the tapestries he stood, and stared
into my lighted room.
A shattered sword was in his hand, those
dancing eyes were still with gloom.
He knelt before my gilded chair heaped with
its cushions of brocade;
He placed no laurels at my feet, his head
against my knee he laid.
•I saw that alien patch of red amongst the
matted hair and brown;
From where the stroke had bitten deep, his
blood was on my sky-blue gown.
My king came home —a king uncrowned —
and I was decked as any queen
In satin petticoat and hose with clocks of
the Imperial green.
My king came home—-a broken man —too
sad to woo, too spent to kiss.
Victor or vanquished, he came home —what
mattered anything but this?
QUEENSLAND.

Catacombs—and the Boom.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEHIND a rickety hoarding in a close-
in Melbourne suburb lies the last
of a dream. A very untidy dream,
for the frowsy block of land is a
kind of illicit rubbish-dump. The tossed-
over refuse stirs uneasily under the teasing
of each northerly. Old papers, old weeds
and old, old dust creep under the hoarding
and strew themselves over the footpath, to
the profane disgust of the city sweepers. In
the far corner, surveyors’ pegs are still dis-
cernible ; if they remain elsewhere they have
long been submerged under successive waves
of south-borne litter.
While passing on my way to or from busi-
ness I had often wondered who might be
the owner of this trash-covered bit of waste
land ; but I had never taken the trouble to
ask anyone who might know. So yester-
day’s incident was quite unlooked for.
It was between four and five in the after-
noon, and I was on my way home, keeping
head down and eyes half-shut against the
gusts of hot wind from the north, when
I stumbled against some object in my path
and found myself thrown violently against
the hoarding, which cracked and gave under
the impact.
“What the” I began, as an old man
scrambled awkwardly to his feet and gripped
me by the shoulder.
“That’s the peg at the entrance,” he piped
shrilly, dancing with excitement, and quite
unmindful of apologies due or payable.
By this time I had dug the dust out of my
eyes and had taken a fair look at the an-
cient. “Ancient” is the word. I am no
stickler for fashions, but the satin puff and
the faded fancy waistcoat and the hard-
hitter, even the cut of the trousers, now
marked with the dirt in which the old fel-
low had been kneeling—well, they must have
been of the vintage of 1890 at the latest. He
gave me scant time for stock-taking, how-
ever, this shrivelled old party with the back-
number clothes and the tin-whistle throat.
He gabbled on, high notes and no rests,
Until I struck in with, “Hold on, brother!
Go over that again. What was that you
said about the cata-something ?”
He obliged by repeating, and was off again,
full tilt. It took an hour to get his story
straight, and at that there were times when
the words got stuck, bottle-neck fashion,
and the wiry old bird simply hopped up and
down, his grey beard sticking straight out
at me, and his skinny arms waving wildly
as he tried to force ten words into a space
that was built for five. All that I can re-
peat here is what sank and stayed with me.
A lot of good stuff washed over the edge of
the pan; but that can’t be helped.
It seems that the old chap—name of
Smith, we’ll say—was one of the luckiest in
the boom days. Prospector, freighter, specu-
lator in land —we all know the turn of that
wheel—and, finally, gentleman, retired, bored
to the last degree of stiffness, with nothing
to do but watch the sovereigns trickle
through his fingers.
Now you think you know the rest of the
story. But you don’t. Smith didn’t do any
of the things you think he did. If he had
done them, I should refer you to pages 136,
281, 405, 1063, et «/., in “The Lives of Our
Pioneers,” and cut off at this point.
His first step, to be sure, was not unusual.
He proclaimed his conviction, so I gathered
from his talk yesterday, that the world was
growing rapidly worse, was alarmingly un-
safe for anyone with property, and that
Reform, in capital letters, must be had with-
out an instant’s delay, or sooner, if possible.
Now this gloomy belief settles upon many
men who have been pitchforked by Lady
Luck right up to the top of the stack. Life
isn’t what it was in their boyhood. Quite
right, it isn’t. When a man is trying to
hold down a moneybag with each arm and
each leg, and another with his chin, it is
astonishing how grasping and immoral his
neighbors appear to be.
When the ancient had come to this point
in his story I offered myself odds-on whal
the object of Reform, in capital letters,
would be. Even money on Monster Drink,
three to one against Little Gamble, five to
one against Smashing the Sabbath. But
there was no picking the winner. I lost
every bet.
If I got the hang of his story, and I think
I did, this man bought a book about the
time he started in to twiddle his thumbs
and lament over the lost state of mankind. It
may have been the only book he owned. As
it lies in my mind it was the only book he
owned. But it was certainly a book to be
proud of —bound in half-morocco, deckled
edges, fully illustrated, ten shillings down
and half-a-crown a week forever; that kind
of a book. The title was “The Early Church
and the Catacombs.” Cheei'ful? Well, not
noticeably; but there must have been some
comfort or, at any rate, soporific, in the
volume, for he read it and re-read it till it
gave him his big idea.
What had to be “downed” as the curse of
weak human nature? You never would
guess. Spires, and arches, and towers, and
wheel-windows! But I turned the laugh
that burst from me into a cough, and apolo-
gised. I wanted to hear the end of the story.
Many of the boomsters in the merry boom-
time, so he told me, put their spare cash
into churches, huge stone affairs, with spires
and towers that are only now beginning to
crumble and slither in bits towards the foot-
paths. In the days of their building these
were proud structures. The old chap—a
middle-aged chap then —got it into his head
that they towered too high, that the builders
were no better than they of Babel. The
book aided and abetted him, for it proved
beyond the shadow of a doubt that the
saintliness of the early Christians was due
to their immuring themselves more or less
completely in the burial-places known as
the Catacombs.
The story seemed to get a bit mixed at
this point, but I gathered that the increasing
wickedness of humankind and the soaring
spires became firmly welded in the man’s
mind. His was to be the mission of recall-
ing sinful Melbourne from an orgy of Gothic
arches to the humility of underground con-
venticles.
“What could be done without an example?”
he propounded, and watched me hopefully
as he asked it,
“Nothing,” I replied promptly. The sen-
sitive old face lightened at this encouraging
w T ord, and the story became more coherent.
The change in the weather had come by
this time, so we sheltered from the fresh
southerly on the other side of the hoarding
It was all quite convincing. There really
did seem to have been nothing for it but to
dig those catacombs. The old prospector
was on familiar ground when he toid me
how he started out to find the right spot. I
forgot the dinner waiting at home, as he
described the way he tested every suburb
in the land-drunk city. Ivanhoe, Footscray,
the hills beyond Camberwell. Ascot Vale—
he dug, he bored, he tested, narrowing his
choice at last to this wind-swept, ill-
conditioned block of land where we stood.
Concealed under a few inches of soil there
was a reef not to be surpassed in Rome
itself. From it should be excavated the
suites of underground chapels that were to
bring men to their knees and restore honesty
and sobriety to the land.
By this time you have guessed how it all
ended. The pegs had been driven, the con-
tracts let, and everything was ready for
action, when the boom burst. Like many
another, the old chap couldn’t have paid for
a grave, not to say whole catacombs of them.
The great scheme remained in the imagina-
tion which gave it birth, and still cherishes
it. For the rest, there is only the waste
land, with its rickety hoarding, and the
dust for ever creeping over the footpath.
The old man was rather shaky as he came
to the end of his story. It had revived the
memory of a bitter disappointment, and
there comes a time in life when memories
are the real happenings of the day, when
sad memories are real sorrows. But I pre-
tended not to see anything amiss, thanked
him for the interest of his story, gave him a
brisk good-bye, and set off at a round pace
for my neglected dinner.

Lame in the morning! A dull, throbbing backache all
day long! Worn out and discouraged when evening
comes! And to-morrow —the same old round of suffer-
ing! It’s little wonder that one is nervous and dispirited.
Yet to endure such misery is both foolish and unnecessary.
You want to be well, and the quickest way to get well is
to find the cause of your trouble and correct it. More than
likely it s your kidneys. That dull, nagging backache
may be Nature’s first warning of some hidden kidney
weakness. You may have headaches and dizziness, too,
with sharp, stabbing pains, a depressed, nervous feeling,
and annoying bladder irregularities. Help your weakened
kidneys before it is too late. Use Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. Doan s have helped thousands and should
help you. Ask your neighbors!
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and the kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish Baths ; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. lam fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”

A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says:—“For years ! suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to lie up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. I
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to me
to try this remedy. I got some, and it proved a blessing, giving
quick relief, and gradually effecting a perfect cure. I feel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble -having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.”

Ambleside’s too dry for ye. It’ll have you in
yer grave while you’re still a young feller,
Ye’ve too much imagination for lectures
and studies and stuff.”
L)r. Tennant, going back through the misty
Dublin streets to his house, found the words
"too much imagination” drifting in and out
of his tired mind. His Danish mother had
given him her Viking visions, no doubt; and
certainly his father, the Home Buie poet,
had had too much imagination—if that were
possible. Anyway, here he was with no
ability to concentrate on his work for more
than half-an-hour, no confidence in speaking
to his class, no interest in anything. Pretty
rough at forty-two!
The ship old Riordan had prescribed had
helped a little. Teneriffe, all green and white
and silent, had sloped gently into the sea
like an lonian island forgotten and content
in oblivion. On the cobbled streets of Santa
Cruz the wine-carts had bumped an lonian
way from the upland vineyards down to the
deep ships awaiting them. That too-much-
imagination could take him back to the vine-
yards on the heights, could sound the Greek
pastoral songs of the wine-pressers in his
ears, could show him, perhaps, some tawny
satyr hiding behind a tree from the startled
eyes of a young shepherd singing mur-
murously to his sheep.
Yet—-Dr. Gerard Tennant roused himself
and smiled perfunctorily at his wife sitting
opposite—here in New South Wales the
spirit of Greece should be, if it were any-
where. The ship had touched at many ports,
silent and green as Teneriffe, loud and dust-
brown as Capetown, cold and white as Bos-
ton, dreaming in death as Alexandria, or
drugged in perfume as Colombo. Each had
hidden a part of the spirit of Greece, but
only a part, until the ship had steamed up
Sydney’s magic harbor.
Here was the perfect setting. The wooded
slopes, the white houses serene beneath the
trees, the blue water, the sunshine and the
blue sky—this was Greece! The men were
brown and upright, with far-visioned, quiet
eyes. Each second passer-by was a poet or
painter, an artist in black-and-white or
music or marble—the encompassing imagina-
tion of Greece. Sport filled their minds ; for
though their population was small they were
pre-eminent in the world’s athletic history—
the Games and Athens’s thundering Stadion !
A pagan mockery, a laughter carefree and
clever, yet simple and natural, was in all
their work, their play and their warfare—
the Greek disdain of solemn materialism,
the Greek satire. Hence Dr. Tennant felt
that he had come home.
Hence, too, the lifting of the shadowy un-
certainty from his haggard face, the' uncer-
tainty lone Tennant was so careful not to
see. Dr. Baudouin, in Macquarie-street, had
questioned her searchingly as as to Ten-
nant’s moodiness, his long, solitary wander-
ing about the city, his complete absorption
in himself. He had suggested that the air
of low-lying Sydney was too enervating, par-
ticularly for such a nervous patient. There-
fore they had rented the Blackheath week-
end cottage of Arnold Silchester, the artist,
and were travelling to it now, Tone fervently
hoping that the sham Blue -Mountains air
would dispel the moody silence.
Her eyes, bent so studiously over her book,
were troubled—troubled by a multitude of
causes. The Gerard she had known and
cherished for ten years was gone. Nothing
remained of him save the handsome shell
looking steadily out of the window from the
corner seat. The wild enthusiasm for dead
Greece which had finally qualified him for
the Ambleside chair had killed her bride-
groom in the strain of imparting his know-
ledge to his classes. Gradually Greece had
become everything; gradually she and the
living world had become nothing. ■ The
breaking-point had come, of course ; and now
she must begin to build up on the tumbled
foundations. Across the years her man’s
laughing eyes looked back at her from the
echo of his laughing, singing voice; in his
place a stranger had sat silent, until now
this sunny country had shown her the first
gleam of hope. But—so much building-up
to do! The months of insomnia, the savage,
uncertain moods, the wild, reasonless fears
—fears of noise, of silence, of old friends,
of strangers, of himself, of her. So much to
do to make again the man the world and the
university read and trusted, her man!
Through herself this could be done, she
knew ; some faith lifted her heart above the
sympathetic voices of the doctors, their
pursed lips and commiserating eyes. She
knew w-ith all her being that she could bring
him back to full sanity. He should have all
the watchful care her great heart could have
given his babies.
in the midday glare the township looked
clean and sharp as they drove through it
silefitly. Silchester’s house was two miles
out on a fair road; they saw the flat, grey
roof below them before they came to the
gate, and walked down the terraced garden
to the house hanging over the gully. When
the rattle of the cab’s wheels had died away
the vast silence of the hills came down like
a tangible presence.
“Look round your domain while I unpack,
Gerard,” she said. “For three months this
is home if we can stand it so long.”
He wandered away while lone opened the
trunks and prayed that, her long service of
selfless watching should bear fruit here. The
keen, bright air should help her, the vivid
health of these Blue Mountain solitudes;
somehow surely it. should come here if
“lone! lone !”
She looked up. Was that enthusiasm in
his voice, or was it the excitement she
dreaded? He came in and stood beside her.
his eyes searching her face,
“lone,” he said again, “this house is Greek,
Come and look at it.”
She got up and followed him. Mr. Sil-
Chester had shown her a photograph of the
house and because it was Greek she had
taken it—to bring it to an open fight between
Gerard’s nerves and the health at the top
of the world: an open, final fight, as Dr.
Baudouin had said in her last, long inter-
view with him.
Tennant took her round to the back of the
house and pointed to the facade of straight,
white columns, to the grey flags of the ter-
race-floor, to the stone-tubs and the dark-
leaved shrubs in them, to a brazier where a
light could be lit, to a stone seat whose
carved back leaned against the wall. He
took her to the terrace balustrade and pointed
down the gully to a grassy clearing guarded
by white gum-trees.
“Listen!” he said.
The whisper of a waterfall broke the still-
ness and came softly up to them. Tennant
laughed and turned to her.
“It is Greece, lone. I told you the spirit
hadn’t gone. It is hidden here. For me,” he
added, his voice falling a tone.
She looked from his rapt face to the cold
beauty of the terrace and house, and down
to the white gums on the floor of the gully.
Her heart shook and missed a beat. Neck
or nothing!
Tennant climbed down the steep track to
find the waterfall. Descending, he was con-
scious that the last few remnants of the pre-
sent age were disappearing; the deeper- he
penetrated the green coolness the less lone
and Ambleside and the earth meant to him,
the less they seemed to exist. As the days
passed his Greek dream strengthened; lie
surrendered himself to the spell of Silchester’s
gully, spending all the daylight hours down
there, and sometimes much of the night,
He receded into the spirit until it seemed
that he had no bodily life at all, until
lone felt that even the handsome shell of
her bridegroom was as much a dream as this
Greece which had drugged him. One thing
only the mountain-air gave him: a normal
appetite. For the rest, she would wake
every night to find his bed empty; she would
come upon him sitting on the terrace’s stone
seat staring into vacancy; or she would hear
his voice murmuring the music of the for-
gotten tongue under the trees or chanting by
the waterfall. As the weeks passed, she
knew that he had not slept, an hour, that, the
fire flashing spasmodically into his tired eyes
was a danger signal, that the open fight was
proving a. hard and bitter one. Her face
grew lined and haggard ; but her heart held
on—neck or nothing ! The wise Dr. Baudouin,
who came once or twice to “spend the week-
end with Dr. Gerard Tennant, the famous
Greek authority,” advised her that the break-
ing-point. had come: she must, give in and
take him away —-three weeks without, sleep
was fatal. But she smiled and shook her
aching head: the breaking-point was not
come yet. When it came she would find
some way to meet and combat, it.
Tennant, standing on a rock beside the
waterfall’s pool, cared nothing for his place
or his mind’s raggedness. Crooning softly to
the waters he stood waiting. All day he stood
waiting here beside the rocky altar which
formed ue wall of the waterfall’s pool.
“Grea; goddess of warfare,” he murmured,
“the suppliant keeps his vigil for your com-
ing.” He lifted his wild, gaunt eyes to the
falling water. “Spirit, of Troy, your servant
has found the hiding-place.” He flung his
arm out to the six serene white gum-trees
and the green depths behind them, to the
altar and the grassy floor. “It is a true place,
holy Athena, for your coming. Your word
is in my heart and I wait, I wait.”
Ho bowed thrice, to the white lace of
water and before the altar-stone, the rippling
music of the Greek still falling gently from
his lips. Shaking back his shock of hair he
strode into the bush, recking nothing of his
place on earth, of Ambleside. or of lone
their shoulders to startle, a young shepherd
singing slumbrously to his sheep. Far oft,
a thm, sweet piping made a lisping cadence
on the air . Ever just beyond his hearing a
cry soun( j e( j from Parthenon: ever just
beyond his sight the dryads peered from
the tree-trunks; ever just beyond his clutch-
bands w hit e scarves swung after the
sbadowy laughter. Ever just out of reach

long farewell. Death is gone—-is gone. ’
A white face shone for a moment under
the veil. His eyes flashed and his arms went
out to her.
“The fallen world is upright; where the
flowers were trampled they bloom for you,
tall goddess of our shields and spears. Where
the silence fell on Hellas new music sings,
Come forth to the kingdom, come !”
He ceased, his body rigid, his eyes wide
open, rapt and still. Out of the lace of the
waters she stepped gently, gliding down
through the bracken to stand before him.
Behind her piled-up hair the golden comb
glittered; her spray-wet white robe clung
about her; and her eyes smiled into the suit-
pliant’s face.
The brooding silence lifted from the bush;
a rustling sounded where the nymphs and
dryads fled away, the muffled thudding of
the satyrs’ hoofs at their heels. Something
snapped in Dr. Tennant’s mind, releasing
the world and Ambleside and lone, and
bringing a vast and blessed fatigue. He
stretched out his hands to the goddess,
“lone!” he whispered, take me home. I
mus t sleep—l must sleep.”

Shotgun Cartridges
are really “Wetproof”
APPLY THE TEST: Take a few Remington
aV Shotgun Cartridges, either “ARROW”,
“NITRO CLUB”, “NEW CLUB” or “REM-
INGTON” and a few of any other make; soak
them all in water for one hour; inspect the
Remington cartridges and fire them all. Then
inspect the other makes and fire them —if
you can.
If one hour of soaking does not convince you,
double the time.
Isn’t it worth while to pay a little more■ for
the best?
Remington Products are sold by
dealers everywhere
