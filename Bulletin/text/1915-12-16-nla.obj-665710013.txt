Conrad’s Victory
Conrad marches from masterpiece to
masterpiece. His new novel, Victory
(Methuen, per Edwards, Dunlop, Sydney),
infinitely outclasses It. L. Stevenson in that
author's own line. In fact, it outclasses
any English novel recently written. By
this fetnai'kable work Conrad reveals him-
self as the super-novelist of England. High
praise. Yes.
The author states that this is an ante-
bellum novel. The book was begun in
October, 1912, and finished at the end of
May, 1914 —-an indication of the slowness
of Conrad’s work. And the scrupulous
honor of the man is perturbed by the
thought that the title might be regarded as
an augury of the war.
The word Victory, the shining and tragic
goal of noble effort, appeared too great, too
august, to stand at the head of a mere
novel. There was also the possibility of
falling under the suspicion of commercial
astuteness deceiving the public that the
book had something to do with war. Of
that, however, I was not afraid very much.
.... Victory was the last word I had written
in peace time. It was the last literary
thought which had occurred to me before
the doors of the Temple of Janus flying open
with a crash shook the minds, the hearts,
the consciences of men all over the world.
....And I made up my mind to let the
word stand, in the same hopeful spirit in
which some simple citizen of Old Rome
would have “accepted the Omen.”
Curiously, one of the chief characters in
the work is a Hun called Schomberg. Con-
rad is careful to remind us that this char-
acter was not invented to give the novel a
topical flavor.
That I believe him to be true goes -with-
out saying.... Schomberg is an old member
of my company. A very subordinate per-
sonage in Lord Jim as far back as the year
1899. he became notably active in a certain
short story of mine published in 1902. Here
he appears... .true to life (I hope), but also
true to himself. Only, in this instance, his
deeper passions come into play, and thus
his grotesque psychology is completed at
1a5t....1 don’t pretend to say that this is
the entire Teutonic psychology; but it is
indubitably the psychology of a Teuton. My
object in mentioning him here is to bring out
the fact that, far from being the incarnation
of recent animosities', he is the creature of
my old, deep-seated and, as it were, impar-
tial conviction.
Certainly, after this disclosure of the
psychology of a Teuton, it is up to the
Huns to “Gott-strafe” Joseph Conrad with
particular animosity.
Schomberg was the originator of the
malicious rumor that set in action the ironic
but heroic tragedy of this novel. He was
“a big, manly, bearded creature' of the
Teutonic persuasion, with an ungovernable
tongue which surely must have worked on
a pivot. Out there he was by profession a
hotelkeeper... .The keen, manly Teutonic
creature was a good hater. A fool often is.”
A coward, too, as the reader learns, follow-
ing the probe of Conrad’s psychological
insight into the nauseous beast.
The plot is built on lines of a simplicity
that is almost sublime. The book could
be read, with delight, as a mere story of
thrilling adventure. It is set on a tropical
isle in the Pacific, where lives Heyst, a
disillusionised Swede. Seams of coal had
been found on the island, and Heyst had
been installed as its manager. The com-
pany failed, and Heyst, glad to escape from
the world, remains amid the wreck of this
grandiose enterprise, a contented hermit.
That enterprise was the one occasion on
which Heyst had been tempted into action;
hitherto he had been content to drift, an
unimpassioned observer of life. This is his
creed :
All action is bound to be harmful. That
is why this world is evil upon the whole.
But I have done with it! I shall never lift
a little finger again. At one time I thought
that intelligent observation of facts was the
best way of cheating the time which is
allotted to us whether we want it or not;
but now I have done ‘with observation, too.
Thus Ileyst, after he had taken the girl
to share his solitude. For the world cannot
be defied, especially when it takes feminine
form. The story of Heyst’s rescue of that
forlorn girl, a member of a travelling
orchestra in Sourabaya, from the lust of
Schomberg, would thrill the most jaded
reader. The impression of reality is over-
powering enforced by Conrad’s own method
of viewing the event through different eyes,
viewing it thus from all sides, giving it the
astonishing illusion of mass and solidity.
Never has Conrad’s method been more
triumphantly vindicated. < These things
happened: they have been seen from every
side, from every viewpoint. And how
astonishingly varied are the minds that re-
flect the solid facts! There is Schomberg’s
hate-distorted vision; there are the three
diverse impressions of the three extraordi-
narily differentiated villains, the “gentle-
manly Mr. Jones,” a living corpse, the
cunning, lust-maddened “secretary,” the
gorilla-like savage attendant; there is
Wang, the callously logical Chinese; there is
Davidson, the placid, kindly friend; above
all, there is the girl—the finest and most
feminine of Conrad’s marvellous gallery of
heroines.
So Heyst, turning his back on the world,
takes this poor girl off to his island, with
the comforting reflection, “The world is a
mad dog. It will bite you if you give it a
chance; hut I think that here we can safely
defy the fates.”
, And Davidson makes but this comment:
“Funny notion of defying the fates—to take
a woman in tow !”
The outstanding point of the book is
Ileyst’s personality. Conrad takes infinite
pains to make that .personality real—and
succeeds.
Ileyst was not conscious of either friends
or enemies. It was the very essence of his
life to be a solitary achievement, accomplished
not by hermit-like withdrawal with its silence
and immobility, but by a system of restless
wandering, by the detachment of an imper-
manent dweller amongst changing scenes In
this scheme he had perceived the means of
passing through life without suffering and
almost without a single care in the world-
invulnerable because elusive.
Trained by his disillusionised father,
Ileyst, as a young man, had learned to re-
flect, “which is a destructive process, a
reckoning of the cost. It is not the clear-
sighted who lead the world. Great achieve-
ments are accomplished in a blessed, warm,
mental fog; which the pitiless cold blasts of
the father’s analysis had biown away from
the son.” “I’ll drift. This shall be my
defence against life,” Heyst had sajd to him-
self deliberately. And then he takes a
woman in tow !
Then the three scoundrels set forth on
their adventure. It is in accordance with
Conrad’s ironic outlook on life that these
three should come questing to the island
for a treasure that existed only in Schom-
berg’s malicious imagination, aided, another
touch of irony, by Scliomberg’s desire to
move op such undesirable customers. And
while they are on their way to the doomed
Heyst and his girl, with supreme art Con-
rad envelopes the island with an atmosphere
of tragic suspense. “Nothing can break in
on us here,” Heyst says to the girl; and the
reader feels the foreboding of the approach-
ing tragedy.
J*
It is characteristic of Conrad’s slow
building-up of his work that not one detail
is slurred. When a savage is shot, you see
him pitch forward—“they always do, to-
wards the shot; you must have noticed it
yourself,” says Ricardo to the trembling
Schomberg, “yes, he pitches forward on to
the embers of the fire, and all that lot of
hair on his face and head flashes up like a
pinch of gunpowder.” Why? “Greasy, I
expect; always scraping the fat off them
alligators’ hides.” Then there is Ricardo’s
elaborate and expert explanation of the
varied u§es to which the knife strapped to
his leg might be put in any trouble arising
out of a little gamble with cards. Quite
convincing—but how did Conrad know, or
guess? There is, too, that curious detail of
the water-pipe on the wharf —any ordinary
novelist of adventure would not take the
trouble to invent or remember such an
apparently insignificant fact, And the
whole of the curious and thrilling conflict
between the doomed Heyst and his three
enemies on the island is elaborated with
tiny'-touches of a remarkable realism —that
barricade, for instance, behind which Wang
waits with the stolen revolver, and the
spear-points protruding through the inter-
stices. But the reader, swept on with the
imminence of the tragedy, has no time to
notice the full import of these so significant
details. All he gets is a sense of the abso-
lute reality of that conflict. There remain,
however, unforgettable pictures, scores of
them, that rise in the reader's memory.
But the background—the love of the girl
for this strange hero —not the young, hand-
some man of the usual novelist of adventure
—frames the swift narrative of action with
a sombre and majestic setting. Here Conrad
has told his greatest love-story; here he has
drawn his finest woman; here he has
painted his final picture of a woman’s self-
sacrificing love.
Louis Stone once more:—
“Masetto'’ should never read in trains. On his
own admission he suffers instantly from lapse of
memory, and cannot call to mind the parts of a
violin (especially the hidden parts), and glue is a
word without meaning or significance for him.
And yet, in this curious mental state he chooses to
gather the material for an attack on the unfor-
tunate author he happens to be reading. In his
first contribution to the gaiety of nations “Masetto”
made merry over my assertion that orchestras
applaud by tapping the backs of their violins with
their bows. This was “Masetto.” “String-players
don’t testify their appreciation that way. It is the
music-stand they hit.” He was gently rebuked, but
proudly announces that this is one of the points on
which he is “still firm.”
Now on November 6 Verbrugghen gave his first
orchestral concert in the Sydney Town Hall. When
he came on the platform the violins welcomed him
by tapping the backs of their instruments with their
bows In the traditional manner. This was done
three weeks ago in the presence of 3000 people, but
I don’t expect that fact to make the slightest
impression on “Masetto.” He isn’t built that way,
and I only mention it to explain why I propose to
ignore any further remarks from him. Another
reason is that he is hiding under a nom de plume.
If “Masetto” has the courage of his opinions, let
him come from behind the hedge, and I will deal
with him to his heart’s content. If he declines to
forego this mean advantage I am afraid my readers
will form the same idea of his courage as they
have probably formed of his intelligence.

The War at ah in Applied A'rt and in Lit-
erature, part I of The Australian Flora in
Applied A vt, by Itklmr<] T. Baker, F.E.S.,
curator of the Technological Museum, Syd-
ney, is welcome more for its promise than
its performance. A book upon Australian
Art ought to be itself artistic. Though the
book features and illustrates the use of the
waratah in book-binding, all that the printer
can provide for the book itself is an ugly
design of something that is certainly not
meant to represent a waratah nor any other
specimen of Australian flora, with a hid-
eously ugly printer’s “ornament” the most
prominent gold-leafed thing on the cover.
And its title-page is hideous. And in the
three-color work the N.S.W. waratab’s true
coloring is not quite accurately rendered.
The editor is more intent on covering his
subject than in developing its artistic side.
Any illustration of the use of the waratah
is carefully .included, no matter how in-
artistic the illustration may be. L. Henry’s
interesting waratah column is disfigured, for
no apparent artistic reason, by the strange
device at the top and the intrusive stars
breaking up the straight line's of the column.
And some of the stone carvings are merely
hideous warnings against their perpetuation.
The ceramic examples are delightful, with
the exception of some extremely glaring and
inartistic tiles. The electrolier, in which
the globes take the form and color of the
flower, is a horror; the clock is an abortion.
The designs for wall paper, dadoes and friezes,
with a .few exceptions, would render any
room covered with them impossible for any-
body with an artistic sense to live in. The
letterpress is, however, informative, and
the inclusion of the legend of the waratah
suggests, if another edition is called for. the
addition of a selection of quotations about
the waratah from the work of Australian
poets.
Such a work was worth doing, but R. T.
Baker’s enthusiasm and patriotism are not
enough: they should have had the co-opera-
tion of an artist and a publisher of taste.
Maybe these were not to be found in the
Education Department of N.S.W. If so.
there are others outside the Department.
If so. it is a pity that they should be outside
the Department. Thus a book that is an
interesting and a patriotic and a necessary
production, lacks the outward expression of
the artistic sense that had inspired it.
&
This page has always had a suspicion
that the late William Shakespeare was
dead; but even in Australasia there are
people who are always eager to disinter
the corpse. How many of these literary
ghouls there are is disclosed by Percy J.
Marks’s Bibliography, of Australasian Shake-
speareana (Tyrrell, Sydney), containing
lists of books, pamphlets and magazine
articles printed in Australasia dealing with
the corpse. As the editor is an official of
the N.S.W. Shakespeare Society, no doubt
this, is a congenial task; but the scope for
original research about a very dead man is
surely very small in this continent, and the
job of adding one single illuminating com-
ment to tiie cartloads of criticism that have
been excavated from the grave is about as
difficult as that of making Shakespeare pay
without the aid of the stage-carpenter. How-
ever, there are minds tjjat find pleasure in
annotating a body of plays that were written
only to be played, instead of concentrating
their energies upon a National Theatre that
would regularly give Australia all that
Shakespeare meant and means. The obitu-
ary notices are as complete as the assiduity
of a lover of the very dead corpse could
make them; and a glance at this admirably
produced book makes credible the compiler’s
assertion that his catalogue contains many
more entries of Australasian Shakespeareana
than are to be found interred in any other
compilation. Books that were published
outside Australasia are omitted, the inten-
tion of the compiler being to include only
those works published in Australasia, even
by writers not Australasians.
The Philosophy of a Ship's Fireman, by
W. Cl Watson (J. F. Andrew, North Melb.,
6d.), is obviously written “by a worker for
the workers.” He is a thorough-going
socialist, and his belief is that “some day,
when the unions have educated their mem-
bers into advocating the co-operative sys-
tem, then will they straighten their backs,
and the middlemen who suck the last penny
from their inadequate wages will uncondi-
tionally slide from their backs, which will
mean a greater return to the producer and
an economising effect to the consumer.”
Also, he believes that this war was engi-
neered “because it will pay. The commer-
cial brigands have things to sell which the
workers made, and they are going to make
an enormous profit out of the things the
workers made for a starvation wage.” And
he whoops on his brothers to “stand
shoulder to shoulder in the great industrial
army, which has waged war on the injus-
tices and wrongs brought about by the
archaic privileges of a ruling class of merci-
less slave-drivers through the ages.”
J. A. Fletcher’s Stories from Nature
(Macmillan) are pleasantly-told accounts
ot' Australian bird and insect life, illustrated
by photographs. The Australian kid will
learn, in these unassuming tales, many an
interesting fact about our interesting fauna.
The “little readers” for whom he writes
should be between the ages of six and ten.
&
Stars of the Southern Skies, according to
its author, M. A. Orr (Longmans, Green,
2s. 6d.), is “for those who have learned or
arc learning to recognise the southern con-
stellations, but have not read much about
astronomy, and have only an opera-glass or
small telescope, or instrument but their
own eyes, for examining the stars.” Such
readers will find something of what they
seek in this volume, but not all. There is
a good star map, and instructions are given
for identifying the constellations; but,
though a considerable amount of information
is obtainable, it is somewhat difficult for the
average reader to disentangle it from its
unnecessary technicalities.
&
Fortunately for 11. J. Bell, author of
N.Z. Camp Fire Recitations (Scott, Is.),
the average reciter is not particularly intel-
ligent, else one would wonder how there
could be any demand for such obvious and
rambling verses.
J*
Among the minus poets I. M. Batten,
author of Star Dust and, Sea Foam (Whit-
combe and Tombs, M.L.), is sadly placed.
He says all the obvious things about love,
with a dreadful facility, like this: —
My love for thee is all my life,
Past, Present and always to be,
Though Parting’s stings and Sorrow’s strife
Must ever threaten thee and me,
My Love for thee is Life’s sweet breath,
That may not cease till lulled by Death.
Possibly the star dust has got mixed with
the sea foam, and the result is mud.
.Jl
G. C. Jones, clerk-in-charge of the Sydney
Railway parcels office, evidently loves his
job. He wrote for the N.S.W. Railways
and Tramways Budget a series of weekly
articles, which are now published in book
form by the N.S.W. Bookstall Go. (Is.), as
Hints to Railway Workers. Amid a huge
amount of technical advice to railway
workers we find this useful definition:
“Railways generally, in Australia, are pro-
vided for the safe and speedy transportation
of the public and articles of commerce.”
Maybe this is not so much a definition as an
ideal.
J*
George Black's The Origin and Growth of
tin Labor Movement in N.S.W. (The
Worker ) recounts succinctly the history of
the movement that has produced, 25 years
after the formation of the State Labor
Party, that dazzling blossom known as
William Holman.
&
M. Forrest adventures into an Australian
fairyland. The Green Harper (Gordon and
Gotch, Q., Is. 6d.) is a little collection of
fairy-tales and fairy-verse. She- sings of
“The Laughter Elves”
They are waiting over the rim of the world for you
to set them going,
You don’t know how you choke their laugh with all
the tears you’re sowing.
A little head lifts o’er the edge, and anxious eyes
are peeping—
Eyes like a wick that wants a match'. —you snuff
them with your weeping!
Oh! the little laughter elves
Go and find them for yourselves.
Short laugh and long laugh and bonnie little
chuckle,
There a glimpse of scarlet cap and here a gleaming
buckle. ...
Pretty little verses and pretty little fairy-
tales. Yet, somehow, M. Forrest has failed,
to acclimatise her goblins and her elves:
she is ingenious rather than convincing. She
does not lead the Australian kiddie into
fairyland : she bids her go thither. She and
her stories have unfortunately grown up.
»
John Roycroft is annoyed, and with
reason, at the slighting reference this page
gave to his recent volume of verse, Rhyme
and Rhythm. The poet informs us that he
is using the volume in canvassing for orders
for packets of his own tea ! “I give one to
each person who orders a pound, and can
assure you that I am working up a very
large connection —thanks to my little book-
let. Last week I put on 70 new customers,
and nearly 50 this week —thanks to my
little booklet.” It must be good tea. More
iu sorrow than iu pain, we print his new
poem of “The Two Films,” which, by the
way, is better than anything contained in
his pound packet of Rhyme and Rhythm,
and we eagerly accept his solemn oath that
this poem is “the last to be forwarded to
The Bulletin by me.” If only the other
minus poets would be so generous!
While seated on a canvas lounge, one fine cool
summers night,
I saw two lovely pictures, at a neiglibring picture
site;
The first, an one of coloured hue, held all amazed-
spellbound :
When lo I in glancing off the screen, the second one
I found.
It was a moving picture, too, most beautiful of all;
Set in the far off Eastern sky, the sight did me
enthrall;
I saw the moon in grandeur rise, midst clouds of
silver white,
The grandest, noblest, picture shown, on that great
picture night.

Self-Loading

Calibers
Winchester Self-Loading rifles
are not cumbersome, compli-
cated or unsightly, but simple,
handsome and well-balanced
guns. Their use permits rapid
shooting with great accuracy and
on account of the novelty and ease
of their operation, they add much
to the pleasure of rifle shooting
either at target or game. For hunt-
ing game which is generally shot on
the run, a Winchester Self-Loading
rifle is particularly handy and effective.
The four different calibers in which this
type of Winchester is made are suitable
for hunting all kinds of game, the cart-

What was
the matter
with Nero ?
We know now. Rome wouldn’t
have burned, and all would have
been happier, if he had had
Cockle’s Pills.
The same internal reasons
that made him cheerful or
depressed are the reasons
that make you cheerful or
depressed. If your diges-
tion is faulty, if wastes
and poisons accumulate
in the system, your outlook
on life becomes poisoned
too. All gloomy and
vindictive people are con-
stipated. Poor old Nero
might have been as cheery
and kindly as you are, if he
could have had —as easily
as you can get them —

‘There is no need to tell people who
aw me two years ago of the
wonderful results of

Tonic”
Mrs. Mary Ethel Hoare, wife of the

her recovery:
Police Station,
Guildford, N.S.W., 2/l/ , 15.
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“My restoration to perfect health has been so wonderful
that I feel that I cannot let this opportunity pass without
letting you know for the benefit of other people the wonderful
results of Clements Tonic.
“For about five years I SUFFERED DREADFULLY FROM
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and INSOMNIA. The least thing
would send my whole body into a tremble. I would shake all
over. . , ~
“I tried medical treatment, but I gradually grew worse.
I could not eat or sleep. I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF
EVER BEING WELL AGAIN, when a friend advised me to
trv Clements Tonic.
" “There is no need to tell people who saw me two years
ago, and who can see me now, of the wonderful results of
Clements Tonic, for from the first bottle I commenced to get
better, and after I had taken six bottles I WAS RESTORED
TO MY PRESENT STATE OF HEALTH, WHICH IS PERFECT.

of this. AS T THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

The Hospital.
Outside, night-voices cry and call
Till comes the hour of rest and peace :
And, save some distant, hushed footfall
Or far, faint wheels, the street-sounds cease.
A slow bell tolls the midnight hour,
And after, through the still, sweet night,
The moon, a high en-azured flower,
Bathes silence in her soothing light.
Near by, the breath of hidden blooms
Makes rich the air, and to and fro
Night-nurses through the long, dusk rooms
lake mercies softly come and go.
For here, within the hospital,
Pain sleeps not, knows no easeful rest,
But ghost-like paces ward arid hall,
Ilis tense hands clutched upon his breast.
A-nigh lies one with aching eyes,
His burning face a darkened stain
In the white moonlight that the skies
Rain on his restless counterpane.
Last night came Charity—her cross
About her neck —and, sweet to see.
Beneath her touch he ceased to toss
And turn and murmur fretfully.
Her cool hand soothed him into calm,
Iler still voice bade the torment stay,
Her words were as the holy balm
Of soft rain on a fevered day.
O Pain and Pity, sisters twain.
Here is your chosen meeting-place;
Here Pity heals the wounds of Pain
And wipes the sorrow from her face !

The Lark.
Where yet the dew to the wild mint clings
You rise with a flutter of sun-caught wings ;
A moment’s pause on the bracken spray,
A leap to the arms of the golden day.
And you swirl aloft in the radiant blue
W 7 here only the sun and the clouds and you
Hold court to-day, and the high winds stir
To the song of the minstrel voyager.
O singer unseen, faint grows the song,
As I lose you the wandering clouds among :
For my eyes are dimmed, and I have not
sight
To follow and follow your sunward flight;
But somewhere over the white cloud-drift
Your pinions beat, and your wild notes rift
The ambient air in an elfin peal,
And high through the halls of silence steal.
And sing you to some darling star,
A trembling fane that only you
Can find in astral realms afar
In that infinity of blue?
Or fly you swift and sure and straight
Beyond the glamor of the skies
To circle the impended gate.
A cynosure for angel eyes?
Perchance you pass in wonder flight
Straight from the dark and lnunbn- sod
Into the great and awful light
That flows around the place of God?
I do not know —I only hear
A sudden ceasing in your lay,
As if in some quick-clutching fear
You pause. Like one that dreads to stay,
Out of the vast and lonely sky,
Songless, on folded wings you come.
Fast-dropping where the daisies lie.
The earth-stars on the fields of home.
Over the meadow’s emerald breast
Somewhere you seek a dew-rimmed nest:
Down where the scented minefield spreads
Purple splendor for wilding beds
You are hid. and I who have lingered long.
Held in the thrall of your rapture-song,
Lightly tread, lest my footsteps stir
The rest of a great adventurer.

Black and Green.
Rank, dew-soaked grasses crowding to a
wall;
Gnarled moss-green trees from which green
apples fall,
Blown by a sudden gust of fretful wind ;
Small leaded panes a shadow lurks behind ;
A narrow room in olive curtains hid :
A casket set with malachite, whose lid.
Crunching with swarthy lips the prismy
cones,
Lifts o’er a broken string of beryl stones;
A woman in a black brocaded gown,
From whose slight waist a peacock fan
swings down,
Curled on a dull green couch, her ebon hair
Braided with jewels, emerald sparked and
rare;
A great angora cat beside her lies.
With sable coat and long green slits of eyes.
The wind among the apple boughs has
ceased.
Comes lightly to the door a black-robed
priest,
And on the polished floor moves stealthily,
Clicking his beads of carven ebony;
And as he bends beneath the groinings low,
On his raised hand there gleams a peridot.
Stroking the cat with fingers quick and lean,
Answering its green eyes with a glance as
green,
He murmurs “Peace be with you,” bows his
head
And all the room grows silent as the dead.
The great cat rolls, luxurious in its fur,
Breaks the cold stillness with enticing purr—
A purr for cottage homes and friendly hobs.
The woman hides behind her fan and sobs.
A robin twitters in the apple tree;
The black-robed priest laughs long and
quietly.

AN OLD WAY TO PAY NEW DEBTS.
When aEneas Cobblestick finds the
butcher’s hill and the jam and carrots in-
voice knocking out the weekly Avage before
the baby’s boots are paid for, there are tAvo
honest lines along which he can proceed.
The first is to cut doAvn expenses.; the second
to increase income. The Commomvealtli is
now in the position of £Eneas, but with a
difference. The cost of the Avar is some-
thing Ave cannot reduce. It must go on;
and, on the appearances of things, it must
increase. We are therefore shut down to
one line of conduct; and the only way in
which the people of the Commonwealth can
be saved from crucial suffering is by an
increase! of income. Such an increase can-
not be brought about by merely levying
heavier taxes on existing wealth. The tax-
able power of the people themselves must
be enlarged. Already the strain of Federal
and State demands is being pretty severely
felt, and there is a limit beyond which our
statesmen cannot go without emptying the
cupboard to the point that Avas reached by
the best-knoAvn dog-fancier in history.
More than a century ago England
gathered with frantic eagerness every penny
of cash or credit that she could find to hurl
against Napoleon ; and when at last the
handcuffs were safely locked -on the limbs
which had torn kings from their thrones and
tossed empires and kingdoms about like con-
fetti, the deficit in the national accounts
brought the people to a hunger as awful
in its way as any of the sufferings of the
long war itself. Economists are not agreed
as to the exact means by which the recovery
Avas effected ; but, as the loot of India Avas
pouring in a thick stream into England
during those years, there is a strong suspi-
cion that the Asiatic plunder came in the
nick of time to make good the lack of state-
craft on the part of those who Avere trying
to find a track out for a dinnerless nation.
History may repeat itself; hut there is little
room in these days for luck to get in any
of her fairy-godmother tricks. Certainly
the discovery of mountains of gold and
diamonds in various parts of the Common-
Avealth is always possible; Hit a Micaavber-
like Avaiting for such bread from Heaven is
not the kind of thing to appeal to the
people who must go hungry if they don’t get
it On all evidences there is no room for
any gamble and no likelihood of salvation
except by our own efforts; and the first
business of our statesmen is to make a
serious attempt to dodge calamity by sound
economic means.
* * * *
To men of narrow vision and lame imagi-
nation the problem may appear beyond solu-
tion. But it is not really so. The Common-
wealth is a lancl-ownor with large and
increasing mortgages whose, estate is only
partially worked. The best portion of the
run has never yet been stocked. In that
unused part the feed is best, the water sup-
ply and rainfall surest, and all the conditions
promise a safe return when the business of
stocking is taken in hand. To strain the
landowners’ present resources a trifle more
to enable him to exploit that better portion
of his possessions is no gamble; it is an act
which none but a person of extreme business
ineptitude would delay. The unused land is
the key to independence and prosperity, and
the thought of the present mortgages
becomes light in the knowledge that there
is such a reserve of potential wealth to fall
back upon. In the case of Australia it is all
but inconceivable that with the tremendous
after-the-war depression facing us our politi-
cians should fail to use the handiest means
of lightening the burden. The Administrator
of the Northern Territory in his latest
report makes it clear that, while the country
he is supposed to manage is admirably suited
to the white man and among the healthiest
portions of the continent, settlement under
present conditions shows not the slightest
inclination to flow in that direction. There
is scope for tropical culture near the sea-
board ; a big promise for the agriculturist
ou the rich, well-watered plateau a few miles
inland; and endless miles of open country
waving with succulent grasses stretch right
down almost to the South Australian
border. Yet the pastoralist is only occa-
sional ; the agriculturist hardly exists; and
tropical adventure in rubber, coffee, cotton,
cane and fruit stays enthusiastically away.
Why ? Because, though officials and red
tape and the A.W.U. and buffaloes and
Government pubs-run-dry are all to be found
there, the pledge of the Commonwealth to
construct the railway from Oodnadatta to
Bine Creek has not been kept. In short, the
national reserve, upon which we may pre-
sently be glad to draw for the national
breakfast, is effectively shut to profit and
use because the people in power have reso-
lutely refused to open the gate.
The depression in ■ England following the
Napoleonic wars may have been lifted by
the inpouring of the wealth of India; the
depression coming to Australia after the
present struggle can certainly he lifted by
taking hold in a business-like way of the
Northern Territory. A leaf might with a
lot of advantage be torn out of the book
of the railway companies which opened up
some of the western districts of the United
States. Those districts had remained with-
out population or productiveness or hope
for many generations, until the railway
people evolved a systematic plan of forcing
them to yield cash. This they did by con-
structing lines and at the same time throw-
ing upon the market the lands which the
lines served. But the lands were not
thrown open merely with a surveyor’s chain
and an auctioneer’s hammer. An army of
workmen Avas employed upon them before
any settler was asked to make his home
there. The ground was cleared, fences
were erected, irrigation works started, fruit
trees planted, houses constructed, schools
and public halls built; and then the land-
salesman got in his fine work on a ready-
made proposition which, while it was good
enough from the settler’s point of view,
brought gold floAving in a steady stream
into the raihvay treasury. The railways
paid interest from the jump; and the land
sales in some cases covered the whole
original outlay. As a business undertaking
the opening of the Northern Territory by
similar methods admits of no sort of doubt.
Pioneering, as pioneering, is a game which
the modern man does not readily take to.
This is not due : to lack of enterprise or
decadence or mere fatigue, or any of the
things which the daily press affects to
denlore, but is based on good sound sense.
The average person who drives a pen or
whirls a bradawl rarely collects enough cash
to go pioneering until he is at least 45 years
of age. To make a home in the Avilderness is
a 25 years’ contract for the person of small
capital; and success at 70 is turned doAvn
by 99 men out of 100 for the prospect of
reasonable comfort all through middle life.
Let the Government do the pioneering, and
reasonable comfort Avith the chance of some-
thing more in the Northern Territory will
have stronger attractions than reasonable
comfort Avith the chance of something less in
Balmain or CollingAAtood.
**” * *
Hitherto the vievr Avhich Australian states-
men have taken of the Northern Territory has
been narrowed by the political consideration
that there are no votes to speak of on the
track of the raihvay that should open it up.
Although a defniitq undertaking Avas given
to South Australia that the necessary direct
raihvay line would be constructed, the con-
struction has been easily delayed on the
ground that the Commonwealth could not
yet afford to put the work in hand. Now,
Avhatever shortage of cash there may be. and
however other demands for money may press,
the position has been reached that the Com-
monwealth can no longer afford not, to go on
Avith the job that Avill insure the immediate
future and drive back the wolf that must
otherwise soon yelp at the back door. From
many points of view the opening of the
Territory is desirable. Its effective occupa-
tion would establish our only sure and per-
manent claim to its possession ; its settle-
ment would provide us Avith the necessary
garrison to defend the top half of the con-
tinent against invasion; its tronic line of
white men’s homes would be the standing
proof of the soundness of the White Aus-
tralia policy. But, beyond all this, the
Territory should be taken in hand and
honestly devcloned because we shall presently
be hard up and it is the readiest reserve of
wealth Ave have to draw on.
HOW ONE OF THE CESARS JUST
MISSED THE BULL'S-EYE.
Gibbon omitted it from his “Rise and Fall,”
but the story has a point all the same: —
The reign of the Emperor Laborius was coinci-
dent with periods of great public turmoil, for the
wars of his predecessor had imposed upon the popu-
lation heavy burdens, and Laborius had burdens
of his own to carry. Not only were the demands
made for the support of the army considerable, but
the requirements of the Senate in other directions
had long shown a yearly growth. The effort to kid
the people that maintenance of the games in the
Coliseum was a productive enterprise had failed.
The importation of wheat from Syria had not re-
duced the cost of living. It was openly stated by
demagogues that the time had arrived when Rome
should put the peg in and cease pur,suing content-
ment and prosperity by the device of accumulating
debt. Tablets were exhibited in public places urging
the nobles and plebs. to return to the simpler erred
of their forefathers —to practise moderation at the
table and not object to wear a toga with a
patch on it. Impassioned philippics were written,
demanding that the sale of wine should be permitted
only within a limited number of hours, and on the
day of Laborius’s triumphal progress along the Via
Perdition he solemnly pledged himself to straighten
up this wine business and put things on a fair basis.
When Laborius came to look into the cause of
discontent about the juice of the grape and other
vegetables he found that the sale of liquor was
carried on by a brotherhood known as the Bungs,
each member thereof paying into the Treasury a
certain contribution of coin every year, and if their
premises were suited for the purposes of affording
the Roman citizen a place of rest and refreshment
such premises were marked with a sign of the owner’s
trade, and became storehouses where wine could be
sold retail and wholesale. Laborius also found that
the Roman citizen was in the habit of frequenting
these premises, which varied greatly in design. Some
were of imposing architecture; others were of no
architecture at all'. Some were open, airy places
where the wine was good and the mugs were clean,
and the servitors becomingly attired. Others were
evil-smelling hovels where the wine was .mostly
sour and the pots brunette. In some places the
Roman citizen could get something to eat; in others
he could get a punch on the nose. Unto Laborius,
still sticking to his job, it was further revealed that
large numbers of lictors were kept busy carrying
the Roman citizen off premises where wine was dis-
pensed to the cooler; and when Laborius asked to
be informed why the law to prevent debauchery w r as
not enforced the lictors intimated that it was
enforced—that the Roman citizen didn’t get his legs
tied up in the wineshop, but got into trouble by
breathing the excessively fresh air issuing from the
fried-fish shop next door. Whereupon Laborius mar-
velled greatly and frowned and was troubled in
spirit, and made a note to inquire into the lictor
department.
# * *
Next day, while he was thinking over the matter,
wild uproar arose in the streets, and, looking forth,
Laborius perceived knots of soldiers wandering at
large with vine-leaves in their hair and singing
songs to Bacchus. Calling his inquiry agent up on
the telephone Laborius bade him' appear and say
who these men were, and what victory they were
celebrating, and how they had returned from Gaul.
Then up spake Marcus Observus, and said:
“C<esar, these soldiers have not been to Gaul;
they are only getting ready to go there. Not being
able to get the juice of the grape at the encamp-
ments beyond the Seven Hills, they come hither.”
“And why can they not get a drink in camp,
whereas they can get 75 drinks in Rome?” asked the
Emperor.
Marcus Observus replied that it was against the
rules; but the Emperor only smote him with his
sword and said they -were damned foolish rules, any-
how, and rushed forth from the palace to the abode
of the soothsayers. There the chief soothsayer took
him into the inner sanctuary and gave him the
strength of things.
“You must understand, Laborius,” he said, “that
there are 543 factors of importance in this wine
business, and 722 that come in on the side. The
Bungs wants to sell wine, wherein there is great
profit; some of the Romans want to buy wine ; some
not only do not want to buy any, but desire to
prevent their neighbor getting any. There are others'
who do not care much about the matter one way or
the other. Roman voices have been heard declaring
that some of the premises should be shut and some
left open. There is great difference of opinion about
how long they should be open. . Disputes rage fiercely
among the common people as to whether the wine-'-
shop should put up the shutters when the baker
ceases trade, so that by this means thirsty souls
would be forced to go for longer periods without
liquor.”
“Yes, yes, that is all right; but people do not go
hungry while the baker is resting. They buy enough
bread to last their families until next day,” observed
Laborius.
“I know that,” said the seer, “but it is possible
they might forget to buy booze.”
“Huh!” interrupted the Imperial voice.
“Well,” proceeded the other, “there it is. Some
of your subjects say that if the taverns are closed
an hour sooner the soldiers will not quaff the flow-
ing bowl so frequently ; others say they will quaff
with even greater rapidity; and there is a sect which
says that if the law were properly applied there
would be no drunkenness, and another sect which
thinks it absurd to act on Draconian principles for
no better reason than that the lictors don’t do what
they are paid for.”
* * * *
Having heard this, the Emperor strode back
towards the palace, and summoning his shorthand
writer dictated the following proclamation, to be
read by the prefects throughout the city:—
His Imperial Majesty Laborius Oassar the Ninety
First hereby directs that new regulations will come
into force forthwith, that is to say: —
(1) That after to-morrow morning any Roman citi-
zen who is seen or heard of being drunk will he
sentenced to seven years’ hard labor cleaning up the
mess at the public abattoirs.
(2) That any member of the brotherhood of Bung
ivho supplies ivine to a person on the verge of
drunkenness will be dropped down the crater of
Vesuvius.
(3) That soldiers will be provided with all the
liquor that is good for them at their encampments,
and that soldiers who come to Rome for the purpose
of training for the wars in the wine-shops will be
harnessed to the regimental water-waggons during
the remainder of the campaign and fed on thistles.
And. further be it understood, that after three
months from the date hereof no further coin will be
accepted in payment of permits to sell liquor; that
on that day all the urine in Rome shall become the
property of the Crown, which will proceed to open
shops for the sale thereof.
In addition, his Imperial Majesty expresses the
opinion that those of his citizens who are spreading
the doctrine that closing the winc-liouses at 10
o’clock instead of 11 o’clock will diminish the
volume of visible drunkenness in Rome have got a
rat.
Also his Majesty wishes the Roman lictors to
understand that' in his judgment nearly the ivhole of
recent difficulties in this matter arc the result
their somnolence, and that unless they wake up •
will be obliged to reduce their pay by 100 per cc
Given under our hand,
C.bsar.
Unfortunately for Rome the Emperor attended a
banquet next evening, at which, after eating ■'
dish of larks’ palates, he was sqized with ptomanw
poisoning and died on the way home. His son, a\ °
came to the throne, was altogether opposed to acting
rashly; and seeing the cloven hoof of Socialism in
his father’s proclamation he ordered its withdrawal,
the Bungs having promised to give him support at the
next elections. Thereupon the loud arguments which
filled the air and almost deafened the lamented
Laborius broke out again and raged with unabated
fury for 1726 years, at which stage the Empire fell
in a heap on the floor and everything perished except
the vine, which still went on bearing grapes ; and the
thirst of the citizen, which still remained in good
working order ; and the wineshops and Bung and the
lictors.
ON GOING TO THE DEVIL IN PEACE
AND QUIET.
Prolonged howls burst from the Caucus
room of the N. S. Wales Labor party lately.
The newspapers were soon filled with exten-
sive explanations and perjuries by various
persons; and then, after everybody con-
cerned had spent several days wrangling at
the top of his voice about 426 different
things, the rumpus was suddenly seized with
temporary paralysis and carried off the
premises. When last heard from it was
expected to break out at any moment in a
fresh place, whereupon there will be more
yells and leaping about and a row that will
subsequently fall down dead —all of which
can be taken as the outward and visible signs
of great internal peace interrupted by riot :
of much satisfaction with what is happening
combined with great distrust of what is
being done. This is, of course, the normal
condition of the party now in power, which,
having hacked the party platform into match-
wood, is busily engaged setting fire to the
remains and rushing about with buckets of
water to souse the flames. Occasionally
someone in a moment of excitement stands
on his head in the bucket, and then there
is a frantic rush to disentangle him and “a
crisis” occurs and the air is rent with im-
passioned volubility, while a weary com-
munity wonders to Heaven why they don’t
all stand on their heads together and have
done with it.
* * * *
This last disturbance seems to have been
precipitated by a fierce burst of hot air from
Holman. Gardiner, who is sent to the
Assembly by Newcastle, had, or thought he
had, occasion to make some .critical remarks
about certain administrative acts of the
Government which suggested that Ministers
were showing a great deal more readiness
to increase the salaries of the higher-paid
officials than to keep the wages of the rank
and file up to the mark. This is a subject
upon which it is possible to talk a vast
amount of nonsense. Fitz Smith, with
£IOOO a year, may possibly deserve every
penny of an increase of £IOO. On the other
hand, he may richly deserve to be fired.
Bill Smith may be abominably underpaid
at 12s. 6d. a day. Also he may be a pointer
who should be prosecuted for taking even
12s. 6d. under false pretences. It all de-
pends on circumstances, but the roar about
injustice being done to Bill Smith merely
because Fitz Smith gets a fair deal is usu-
ally dishonest and fraudulent. Neverthe-
less, Gardiner may have been right. But
that doesn't matter. The point was that
llolman took up the attitude that Gar-
diner was a “traitor” for daring to criticise
the Government. The accuracy or wildness
of Gardiner’s remarks thus became a sub-
ject of minor importance; and after llolman
had fiercely “warned” Gardiner and threat-
ened to have him excommunicated for breach
of discipline, a clamorous controversy arose
as to whether under the party rules and regu-
lations a member of Caucus dare open his
mouth in the Assembly, except by special
leave of the .Ministry, and, if he could
open his face, what he might be allowed to
say when he did it. It Is probable that
Holman preferred to have a wrestle with
Caucus on this subject than a public debate
on the issues raised by Brother Gardiner.
If he-.didn’t it would have been easy for him
to shoyv that the allegations'brought against
the Ministry were without foundation in
fact —that Gardiner was a reckless blather-
skite who did not know what he was talking
about —and let it go at that. Hol-
man, instead of doing anything like this,
promptly produced a red herring: which sug-
gests an official recognition of what _ is
probably a fact, that the principal necessity
of the hour is to get everybody well gagged,
so, that the llolman gang may continue its
operations more comfortably.
That any member of Parliament should
be denied liberty to criticise the administra-
tive acts and legislative proposals of any
Ministry is not an arguable proposition. A
member who surrenders himself so entirely to
the superstition called Party becomesm mere
political prostitute. There is a x’ast' differ-
ence between a spineless acquiescence in
everything a Ministry may say and suggest
aiid do and the faithful observance of such
a pledge as a Labor candidate for Parlia-
ment enters into. This pledge is part of the
contract made between the people and their
representative, binding him to “carry out
the principles embodied in the Labor plat-
form and on all questions affecting the plat-
form to vote as a majority of the"- Parlia-
mentary Party may decide.” Its words are
as clear as its meaning and its intention,
which was to secure from the rather slippery
lot by whom it has to be taken a definite
undertaking not to bolt from certain specific
principles. It does not imply and has never
been taken by the people to convey that the
man who signs it has bound himself to
become a dummy or that he surrendered any
part of his rights to criticise the methods of
the Government in regard either to admin-
istration or to proposals submitted to Par-
liament. What chance would a man have
of election at the hands of a democracy if
from every platform be assured the electors
that he would keep his mouth shut no
matter what happened, and would be as
dumb as a native oyster even if the platform
were carried out to sea in a garbage punt


and deposited at midnight in 740 fathoms
of water? Not a million to one! For even
the most apathetic citizen knows that in
Parliamentary government there are many
dangers; that the Party system is a vicious,
immoral animal ; and that administration
and legislation in the hole and the corner
will inevitably become corrupt. Control ot
government by a Parliamentary party
gagged to silence is not popular government.
It is despotism, as absolute as that of the
Great Mogul, and more vile. And when the
pledge to support the Labor platform is
used to enforce support for the blunders ot
a Ministry whose very existence is a travesty
on Labor, and whose record has been one of
unexampled treachery to the people who
gave it office, The Bulletin finds some
difficulty in deciding which lot of men most
deserve the dead cat of obloquy : the spine-
less humbugs who keep silent for the sake
of their jobs or the leaders who have driven
their dumb cattle into this abyss of shame.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Knock-olt-work Insanity.
Australian industries have their chance to
a greater extent than ever before. The big
German dump of goods has ceased, and the
temper of even the most hardened former
opponents of the doctrine of employing Aus-
tralians to do Australia’s work has for the
time changed. Doing our own work, making
our own breakfast and trousers, we can face
the after-war crises, whatever they may be,
with some sort of confidence. But we have
no hope at all of dancing into economic
independence to the tune of 27 strikes a
week. If the Australian worker is to come
to his own, he ought to see to it that industry
as industry gets a proper show, and that in
striving for an extra 2d. per day he is not
giving his job to somebody in another coun-
try who will do it for ss ; a daj less. In
view of the new favor with which Austra-
lian goods are regarded, men would be willing
enough to put cash into Australian enter-
prises if they could see their way clearly
before them for a definite time. How much
they have to pay out in wages is not the
thing that counts. It may be much or it
may be little; the one thing necessary is
that they should know beforehand how
much it is to be. In order to make this
possible Wages Boards and Arbitration
Courts have been established, and through
these all difficulties can be settled. When
the workers resort to their old illegal
weapon, the strike, they may be securing a
temporary benefit; but they are running a
tremendous risk. If the people who make
the wheels turn and. the spindles fly are
really anxious to see Australia a manufac-
turing country in the larger sense, and to
make sure that German trade will not revive
after the war and that they are not driven
out to milk cows and chop firewood by cheap
Asiatic competition, they must settle down
to graft on the basis of their awards, and
use the ordinary legal means to secure im-
provement of wages or conditions. Neither
tariff increases nor a loyal desire on the
part of Australian citizens to use Austra-
lian goods can make work for Billjim if‘
he won’t do the work with some sort of
regularity when he gets it.
♦
The Class-party Fraud.
The question which N.S.W. Minister Estell
was asked the other day as to whether he
did or did not intend to compel the payment
of penalties imposed on those who break the
anti-strike laws indicates once . more the
folly of party as a basis for administration.
Fines have been inflicted on employers and
have been collected; they have been im-
posed on employees and forgotten _ or for-
given or held over or any old thing that
would save the Minister’s face before Ins
Labor supporters. The Ministry is _ sup-
posed to act without prejudice in the inter-
ests of all and give as good a deal to the
owner of half a suburb as to the man with
a hole in his boot. In practice, however, the
Labor Ministry has no chance to hold the
balance evenly. The man with a hole in his
boot is his acknowledged master because
from him his bread-and-butter With official
trimmings is derived; the owner of half a
suburb, on the other hand, is the enemy,
and as such must obey the letter of the law.
Were Labor the creed of high spirit and
noble aspiration which it professes to be,
its supporters would see to. it that they
accepted no favors and received the same
kicks as the other fellow for similar offences.
But Labor doesn’t take that sort of stand.
In N. S. Wales at any rate it will loudly
demand and obtain equal opportunity, and
then humbly 'dead for special consideration
for persons in soiled trousers. If it had
a sufficient allowance of pride Labor govern-
ment might he workable; as it is, Labor
men themselves begin to see that the aboli-
tion of party is about the soundest piece
of timber in any platform. When a
party is also a class, party rule must be
class rule; and class rule is a violation of
the principles of democracy which is sure
to make for trouble. Once establish the
principle that one class in a community shall
be free from obligations which press upon
the rest, and there is no reason why other
classes should not fight to secure a lease of
power which will give them like exemption.
Class government generally ends by landing
in supreme power one man who sees to it
that all men obey the law except himself.
■
Cocky anti the Wheat Deal.
Having cooled down a bit Cocky is begin-
ning to see the good points of the national
wheat deal, and to realise that without some
such scheme the exceptional position as to
freight would have put him at the mercy
of his old friend Pirate Enterprise, who
would have skinned him with great cer-
tainty. Therefore Cocky, having swallowed
the general principle of the thing—which,
after all, is merely a sort of enforced co-
operative marketing—is in a better frame of
mind to consider the details; and some of
these are making him sit up o’ nights and
comb his whiskers thoughtfully. The ad-
vance against sales, 2s. 6d., he almost
unanimously regards as painfully parsimoni-
ous, while the allowance to selling agents,
o[d. a bushel, is just as unanimously re-
garded as outrageously liberal. Conse-
quently Cocky is howling for an increase in
the advance and for a cut in the deductions.
And taking everything into consideration he
is asking for no more than a fair thing. The
London price of wheat is now about Bs. per
bushel (645. per quarter). Freight even at
955. per ton is under 2s. 3d. per bushel.
The market is firm, and the before-men-
tioned price has been paid for shipments in
January. An advance of 3s. would, there-
fore, it seems, leave ample margin on present
transactions to cover the possible risk on
future deals. If the market should sud-
denly change, the advance on the later
deliveries could be reconsidered; but there
seems no fair reason why those who can
deliver at once should be precluded from get-
ting the benefit of the' present market. This
would not affect the final distribution;
those who had got more by way of advance
would get less by way of cuts from the pool.
Admittedly in a business like this the State
is under an obligation to work on a margin
selected with gheat care. But the circum-
stances of so many farmers, consequent on
the drought—of two years in many places—
are such that 2s. 6d. a bushel will not suf-
fice to pay the long-overdue store bills ; and
that means that they must still flounder in
a choking bog. During the time that
3s. can be safely paid, therefore, it
should be paid. Coming to the .other
point, the commission fixed for agents
is open to the sharpest criticism. No
reason has been advanced why 3jd.
was arrived at; there are many reasons
for concluding it to be grossly excessive.
The Victorian Wheat Commission in 1910
found that exporting charges on wheat,
including the cost of the hag , (2.33 d. per
bushel), was 3.51 d. per bushel. In this
present deal the shippers are to get 3.20 d.
and have not to provide the hag. Why? Op
these figures—and they have not been seri-
ouslv disputed —it looks as if Id. a bushel,
in addition to the ordinary stevedoring,
weighing and other charges, would represent
very handsome payment. Seeing that the
farmers have no option, and must employ
these men to handle the whole proceeds of
their year’s labor, the Government is bound
to dig* into this question of commission and
charges with the utmost care. Its one busi-
ness is to protect the men whose whole year’s
labor has been commandeered, and it occurs to
The Bulletin that it will be much easier
to do it now than after the swag has been
divided.
A Matter of Urgency.
The Australian Protectionist Association is
on sound ground in asking Prime Minister
Hughes to call Parliament together early
in the New Year to deal with the promised
Protectionist tariff. Time and opportunity
will not always favor us. The war has
given us this protection, that practically all
imported goods are much dearer than they
were, and still they sell as fast as they can
he dragged out of the ships. The Australian
manufacturer can pay high wages, with
short hours, and still turn out goods, such
as galvanised iron, manufactures of metals,
etc., at less than the present figures for
imported stuff; but he isn’t going to lay
down an expensive plant and train compe-
tent workmen unless he gets a guarantee
that within a few months of the conclusion
of the disturbance he won’t be utterly wiped
out and ruined by floods of imported goods
from countries where the manufacturers
will be glad to work for next to nothing if
they can thereby recover their trade. The
point is that Australia has shown she can
afford to pay high prices provided she can
get work to earn the money to pay them
with; also the less she imports in future the
more of her exports will go to pay the
interest on war and other loans. Also the
more advanced in manufacture her exports
are the better they will pay her. Leather
will give a better return than hides, flour
than wheat, and so on. But the manufac-
turer is waiting for the guarantee of per-
manent protection—the guarantee he has so
often demanded and so often been promised
and so often not got.

The Man and the Land.
“The Pariah” has a yarn about Dennis:—-
Over 20 years ago Pinny went into the Beech
Forest (Vic.) to carve out a home in the big
timber. The young missus went with him, and they
reared six strapping- sons and daughters. Between
them they cleared the 320 acres and paid for them.
Mostly the timber money did that. Pinny was too
far away from markets to grow produce, so lie fat-
tened a few bullocks. Then the “Innaminka” fires
wiped him out. Back he went to scratch the second
time, and was still battling gamely when the doctor
ordered his white hairs out of the bush he had
wrestled with so gamely. Backed by an agent he
bought a few acres when Coororooke was cut up five
years ago, put in onions, and cleared himself in two
good years. Two years —and it had taken him almost
a lifetime in the bush to do half as much!
The land he bought cost him £72 per acre.
Thirty years before it had been a part of old-man
Robertson's big Elen Alvie kingdom. Someone got
it and a lot more for £8 per acre, re-selling more
than half almost immediately at more than double
that price. How much the Crown got for it in the
first place I don’t know. It was practically a grant,
I believe. For years it lay drinking in God’s free
sunshine and rains, almost absolutely unproductive,
but saturating itself with increment. Then, when
the time was ripe, it was made available, and as
much as £lO4 per acre was offered for one five-
acre parcel!
Thousands of Australians are held out of their
inheritance, and have to sweat blood for the benefit
of the landlord who does nothing but wait. So
Dinny is forced into forest land to make a living,
and why should we curse him if firestick and axe
are fast destroying big national assets? Reckoned
in terms of timber destroyed each 320-acre selection
in the Otway and other forests has cost thousands of
pounds. In terms of manhood wasted, what would
be the total?
Horatio Bottomley, crank, politician,
owner of racehorses and newspapers, fren-
zied financier and enthusiastic opponent of
party government, has rushed to the British
rear with a proposal to arm and drill a
million niggers for service against the Ger-
mans. The argument that the destroyers
of Belgium deserve no better opponents
than the savages to be collected in Africa
and elsewhere may have something in it;
but the proposal itself is about the worst
that has yet come along. When the ancient
Britons were left by the Romans to carry
on as best they could, a person like Bottom-
ley evolved a similar scheme. The Briton
just then couldn’t fight enough to keep him-
self warm, and so the savages from across
the North Sea were called in to do the work
by contract. The savages took the job on
cheerfully, but when it was completed they
resolutely refused to knock off and return
home. To them it was quite evident that
the people who could pay but couldn’t fight
■were very small potatoes and quite unfit to
hold and rule a moderately rich country.
So the savages took the country, and the
Britons got back into Cornwall and the
Welsh mountains, and tried ' conscription
and learned to fight; but by the time they
were organised and ready there were so few
of them left that their fight never amounted
to more than a pin prick in the side of the
new nation which the savages had created.
Bottomley’s scheme is worse than Vorti-
gern’s in that the savages he proposes to
call are black instead of white. The old
savage invaders of Britain in course of time
evolved into Englishmen, but Bottomley’s
million would be much more likely to evolve
into devils. To pour nigger into Germany
with the chance of the black streak staying
there and fusing with the existing savage
would be more than a dangerous experiment.
B would lead to wars of extermination in
the future beside which the present contro-
versy might be as mild as a Sunday-school
picnic.

“The Old Soldier” recalls the good old
times: —
Notwithstanding the horrible stories about losses in
battle and the number of crippled men who are
returning home, it is cheering- to learn from a report
on the work of the British A.M.C. that, “in spite
of the hideous wounds inflicted in this war, 60 per
cent, of the men who pass through the hospitals are
finally reported as fit for service again.” That is an
extraordinary ratio of recoveries, for it really means
that three-fifths cf the wounded are thoroughly sound
men again. To anyone who, like myself, took part
in the wars that followed the middle of last century,
the statement would seem incredible if we did not
know how great have been the advances in surgical
science. In the Crimea and the Indian Mutiny a
severe fracture was supposed to make amputation of
the limb necessary to save the patient’s life, and
the proportion of recoveries from such operations
was very small. Sixty years ago ansesthesis was only
newly discovered, and antisepsis was very imperfectly
known. There is another thing that only war
experience can teach. When a man is brought in
with a shattered limb from the field of battle, he is
usually in a state of wild excitement. This neutral-
ises the anaesthetics; yet, in the absence of anti-
septics, amputation could not be delayed. In those
days army transport was very crude. The short-
comings of the British army in the Crimea are com-
monly put down to the faults of its Generals and
staff, but they were much more due to the want of
transport. As for ambulances, when there was an
accumulation of sick in camp before Sebastopol a
requisition used to be sent to the cavalry to send
horses to carry them over the seven miles to the
hospital at Balaclava. There was then no ambu-
lance and no medical service. Each regiment had
its surgeon and assistant-surgeon, its hospital ser-
geant and some orderlies taken from the ranks, and
the bandsmen acted as stretcher-bearers when the
regiment went into action. In India, however, we
had a medical service, tvith native dressers and
compounders, and a body of apothecaries, trained in
a local medical, school, with dholis, dandis and
ambulance waggons drawn by commissariat bullocks.

Though among -their flocks there may pos-
sibly be a few black sheep who doubt
whether the Kaiser actually is God, the
Anglican Bishops of Victoria are appar-
ently quite satisfied that Bill is at least
llis instrument. A pastoral letter was
issued to the clergy the other day as fol-
lows :—■
We urge you and the people committed to your
care to offer instant, insistent and fervent prayer that
grace may be given to each and all of us to lay to
heart the sins of our Empire, for which the Divine
chastisement is visiting us, as well as the miseries
consequent thereon, and that each one may realise
more fully his personal responsibility in the national
repentance which must precede God’s forgiveness.
This is signed “with the full sense of our
responsibility” by persons who call them-
selves H. L. Melbourne. J. I). Bendigo,
T H. Wangaratta, a. W. Gippsland and
W. F. Tucker. Definitely what are the
“sins” that Gltpsland and Bendlgo are
talking about, as il: Australian soldiers were
being butchered at Gallipoli under orders
from the Almighty? And if we are being
visited by Divine chastisement at the hands
of the linn, who is God’s instrument, why
resist it —why not take it in the neck? We
being chastised because we went to the
rescue of civilisation! The bloodstained
ravishers of Belgium God’s instrument!
Will these distinguished clergymen never
leave off their blasphemies?
The coming Victorian Lai vest should test
the genuineness of the Government’s decen-
tralisation policy. There promises to be a
record shipment of wheat, and it must be
got off in record time, as vessels are much
too valuable just now to be kept waiting
for room around piers, to load from double-
banked trains which have carried their loads
over hundreds of miles of unnecessary rails.
The facilities of Melbourne have been tested
and found wanting on many previous occa-
sions when wheat was not so numerous or
the need for speed so urgent. But this year
there is a chance to relieve the bloated
metropolis of some of its congestion. The
deep-water pier at Portland, which is being
enlarged at a cost of £OO,OOO or there-
abouts, is nearing completion. Even in its
present state it could accommodate the
largest skiffs hunting for wheat and other
produce. Moreover, the railway from
Ararat has been relaid with heavy metals
capable of carrying the goods. Also the
grades on the line are easy, and the port is
a day or so nearer the European markets.
In the past Melbourne interests have always
cut Portland out of the programme; but
now that the Government has lifted the
business out of private hands and taken
full control of the harvest, decentralists
will know who the latest culprit is if the
Western port is not utilised.
If a man wishes to leave Australia to-day.
he has to get a passport and satisfy the
authorities that he isn’t going to America,
say, or Sweden, from any unpatriotic
motive. If lie can’t satisfy them he doesn’t
go. But apparently the men who have
sworn and are paid to serve their country
and study its interests may help the foreigner
while robbing their own country without let
or hindrance. That is the only conclusion
possible to draw from the action of the
Federal Munitions Committee in accepting
an importer’s tender for 60,000 oregon
bpxes to hold shells, in spite of a Victorian
miller having tendered for hardwood cases
at 6d. per case less. He offered the stronger
and more durable article at a lower figure,
but the unpatriotic committee turned him
down and gave the job,to the foreigner. By
the way, has anyone asked the Munitions
Committee who the shells are being made
for? It is just as well to be sure that these
patriots haven’t made a mistake and think
we are still helping the Germans.
Martin Hannah. Labor member for Col-
lingwood in the Vic. Assembly, is an enthu-
siast and something of an expert in
matters relating to forestry. Some time
ago he started a little exhibition of
our own timbers in the lobby at Parliament
House; and whenever a Governor comes
near him, or any other person who may be
of value in advertising Australian woods,
the serviceable patriot hands out a walking-
stick made of a'local product and tells him
all about it. Speaking on the Estimates,
Hannah again brought forward his persis-
tent plea for the planting of timber-trees on
unused and denuded Crown lands. As an
instance of the Government’s ineptitude in
conservation and exploitation, he reminded
the Ministry that the street* of Melbourne
are at the present moment being paved with
Westralian jarrah blocks, dragged the width
of a continent, instead of Victorian blue-
gum, cut a few miles away. The blue-
gummer insists that his vegetable will out-
last jarrah by many years; but the City
Council took the jarrah because cheap Pri-
vate Enterprise bluegum was not available.
Yet the Government owns most of the blue-
gums in the State and could mill them
cheaply by the million if it chose. If the
State would put on a few hundred men to
cherish its vegetable resources —protecting
the trees from timber-sharks and fire, and
assisting selected gums to steady growth—
within a comparatively few years an asset
would be available which could be regarded
with self-respecting pride, a state of mind
for which no “successful” loan-raising can
ever be responsible.
From a man who ought to be well-informed
about it: —
Stephen Albert Whiteman, an institution in the
North-Western Pacific, is in serious trouble mainly
because at a critical time he assisted the naval and
military expedition against the Germans. White-
man has been an agent and storekeeper in Rabaul
for the past 10 years, and is one of the best known
of the Australians in the Islands. Under German
rule he flourished ; but he is now practically boy-
cotted by the Germans, and the Australian Govern-
ment will not examine into his claims for compen-
sation.
Nobody knowing the facts of the capture of the
German gunboat Ivomet, and other matters affecting
Whiteman, "can truthfully say that he has been
justly dealt with. At the outbreak of hostilities he
was arrested by the Germans, kept prisoner in the
jungle somewhere in New Britain, and relieved
about a week after the feritish-Australian occupa-
tion of the* islands. He then assisted the military
administration, and was instrumental in locating a
large quantity of Government stores and coal which -
had been secretly distributed among the local Ger-
man firms. Believing that the Komet was some-
where around and in wireless communication with
Admiral von Spec's fleet, the Scharnhorst, etc.,
Whiteman sought information from the natives, and
afterwards gave Rear-Admiral Patey the important
news that the gunboat was in hiding at Talasea;
hut Patey, for some obscure reason, must have
thought the information unreliable. Anyhow, he
did not act upon it.- Whiteman then induced the
military authorities> to equip a small expedition for
the seizing of the vessel, and accompanied the party.
The craft was found at the place indicated, and it
was Whiteman who went on board with Colonel
Paton and bluffed Commander Moeller into peace-
ful surrender. By locating the Koinet Whiteman
not only obtained a valuable prize for the Govern-
ment, but also ended the continuous wireless com-
munication between that vessel and the Scharnhorst.
Homecoming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wiiat magic do you hold,
Brown fields and hills of gold?
I have seen Beauty’s eyes
Beam down from softer skies,
And still my heart was cold.
Proud temples I have seen
Ilise up through fronds of green;
Old woods wiih haunted trees,
Dim islands in blue seas
With white curved sails between-
And yet my mind would roam
Back to the hills of home ;
My blood as all athirst
For ways where I was nursed,
Beyond the walls of foam.
Here the earth’s breath is sweet;
Dawn comes on glimmering feet,
And through the singing blood
Life flows at tidal-flood
When youth and morning meet.
Here purple dusk comes down
Slow on the somnolent town.
And intimate scents arise
What time the starry flies
Burn in the orchards brown.
Here mind and tongue are free,
Eyes laugh in charity ;
Here word and deed are one ;
A man’s his father’s son,
And talk flows easily.
O land of fire and dew !
How all old dreams come true!
My living dust is part
Of your young, militant heart —-
My soul is filled with you!

Bash! Bash! Bash!
The oration of the German Imperial Chan-
cellor about peace boils down to this: “We
are not beaten, and cannot be.” As for the
rest, it was just the kind of hot air that has
issued from Berlin many times before, and,
for that matter, is occasionally permitted to
escape in other countries. Peace is not up
for discussion. Therefore any reference to
it is bogus and must remain so until the
hour arrives when one side or the other is
ready to confess the dverwhelming strength
of the enemy. Up to the present nothing
has occurred to show that the power of the
Allies has reached its maximum. What is be-
coming fairly clear is that the strength of Ger-
many is not growing greater, and that before
long, if not already, repair of the hideous
wastage her armies have suffered must tax
her recuperative powers. Meanwhile, no
good purpose is served by denying that the
Hun has succeeded in making matters infer-
nally interesting for the Allies, on the road
to Constantinople; but to try from this dis-
tance to fathom what is taking place there,
or what is going to happen next, or what
the whole complication is going to lead to is
about as profitable, in view of the general
misinformation available, as gazing long and
earnestly into a mine shaft with the object
of counting the dividends in the low-
est tunnel. Apparently the over-run-
ning of Servia is absolute; the allied
troops have been pushed back from
somewhere to a new address nearer
the sea; the Greek is still sparring for
wind, with the obvious intention of being in
good nick when the plunder can be seized
with safety; and vague yarns are whirling
around with reference to invasions of India
and Egypt. Taken by and large the mean-
ing of it all is the same as the meaning of
everything else that has occurred since the
rumpus started —that we are not out of the
wood, that our troubles are increased Dy
every check, we receive, and that men and
more men and men quickly are the first and
last essential. John Bull seems to be get-
ting into khaki a little more satisfactorily
under his hybrid-DERBY scheme, but the
press-agent shrieks that have been cabled
during the past few days can be safely dis-
counted 90 per cent. The cold truth drips
out of the statement of the chairman of the
Labor party that the scheme has not given
enough young men, and the Times announce-
ment that Parliament will now insist upon
the nerveless Government putting more
ginger into the whole bungled, irresolute
business.
From a circular dated Dec. 7, issued by
one of the big banks with head-office in Mel-
bourne :-
There will probably be a-large number of applica-
tions in the near future from officers throughout the
service for permission to volunteer for active service
with the Australian Imperial forces.
A reasonable proportion of trained officers, i.e.,
with banking knowledge and experience, is abso-
lutely necessary to the carrying on of the bank’s
business, and it would appear that the limit of the
institution’s ability to spare further men of that
description has almost been reached.
AU officers, both senior and junior, if questioned
by the Government as to volunteering , must in every
case give their ans ver, if it be an affirmative one,
subject to the bank’s permission being obtained. The
request for leave should then be submitted for con-
sideration.
Applications as received will be duly recorded,
and when the bank is in a position to provide relief,
the officers concerned will be advised.
Dividends as usual, though the Empire go
to blazes!
“D.P\” : Licensing legislation in Tasmania
is getting into a dreadful tangle. Parlia-
ment recently passed a Bill ordaining that
from January 1, 1916, all drinkeries shall
close at 10 p.m., and there is also an Act on
the statute book which says that in 1917
local option is to come into force through-
out the State, and people are to be asked
to say whether they will shut all the pubs,
shut some of them, or leave them all alone.
So far so good ; but now a Bill has passed
the Assembly and is ready for the House
of Dodery, which provides that at the State
general election in February a referendum
shall be taken on the point whether pubs
should be closed at 6 p.m.; at 11 p.m.; or
at some intervening hour. In its present
form the Bill sets forth that the bars only
shall close at the hour fixed on, the rest
of the premises remaining open, and
if that goes through the police will have a
lively time. Meanwhile there are in Hobart
and other parts of the State a number of
low groggeries which should be closed right
away. But the more. extreme ’postles of
Cold Water will not co-operate in getting
these and these only closed; they are too
useful as frightful examples.

The 1915-16 Tivoli Follies are getting so
much praise from the Sydney press that the
really conscientious critic (the type that re-
ligiously eats too many cream puffs in order
to keep himself bilious) begins to suffer
from ingrowing melancholy and professional
doubts. While the bright little show
twinkles along he sees the dust of the labora-
tory accumulating on his acid jar, and finds
that a rat has built its nest in the locker
where he keeps his slings, arrows, knuckle-
dusters and sandbags, Realising that no-
thing lie can do will hold the public away,
he sits down and resignedly groans out his
praises like a true Christian.

The “Encyclopaedia Britannica,” which
has almost too much to say about most
things, treats the food of the gods with
contempt. From Paz Soldan, Mariano
Felipe (1821-1866), Peruvian historian and
geographer, who has no connection with
this subject, the grand old work rushes
through a column about the respectable
garden product to Peabody, Andrew
Preston (1811-1893), American clergy-
man and author, who was born in
Beverly, Massachusetts, and probably never
ate the stuff in his long, religious life. But
Webster’s “New International Dictionary”
uses strong language. It says, like an
exorcist casting out devils: —
Peanut (pe’nut), n. 1.: A tropical fabaceous plant
(Arachis hypor/ma) , of erect habit, with trifoliolate
leaves and bright yellow flowers, whose peduncles
bend after fertilization and push the pods into the
ground, where they ripen.
Subsequently the remnants of the accursed
thing are found scattered on the floors of
theatres and picture shows after the per-
formance. Those who have seen the floor
when the gorged peanut-eaters have gone
home say the Devil would never think
of paving Hell with good intentions
while peanut-shells were available. The

“Kick-in,” latest of a long series of Yankee
“crook” dramas at Melbourne Royal, de-
serves a little forbearance from married men.
A “cop” in the first act tells the boss “cop”
that he objects to sleuthing with another
“cop,” who is specially brutal to women
“crooks” on account of his bachelor condition.
Which suggests that but little human kind-
ness can be expected from any ’Murkan male
citizen until he has become a husband and a
father. The drama revives this suggestion
at the finish of the final act, when the boss
“cop” deals gently with the heroine on the
understanding that she will shortly confer
the dignity of fatherhood on the penitent
forger of her choice. Meanwhile the drama
is a stirring story of crooks, criminality,
coppers and corpse. The corpse is that of an
unseen yegg named who glommed a
string of rocks but was potted with a gun
whilst making his get-away. Benny’s
faithful donah smuggled him into the house
where his old mate, Chick Hewes, was trying
to lead an unblemished life with Molly, but
the gunshot had been too much for the
burglar, and he subsequently died on the
premises. Hence the necessity for remov-
ing his body in a barrel after dark, and con-
signing it to a watery grave. Ben’s donah
disposed of her own live body in the same
manner, so there would have been nobody
left to associate Chick and his missus with
the rocks job had not a morphia maniac picked
up the string of jewels and caused some
sensational complications. The best of the
complications is effected by Molly, who
shoots a cop with the dope fiend’s darning-
needle whilst he is struggling to arrest her
husband —-which means in English that she
sticks a hypodermic syringe into a police-
man’s hand and drugs him.
All people who have been frequently in
gaol, and many who ought to be there, will
take delight in “Kick-in” if they go to see
it. Its sentiment smacks of the prison cell.
The crooks are heroic without exception.
There is not even a stool pigeon amongst
them. The cops, on the other hand, are
the most contemptible, treacherous and
utterly damnable guys that ever sloughed a
bit of slick skirt. Even the fact that
Deputy-Commissioner Plumer has a ’eart as
can feel for a mother doesn’t save him from
general condemnation. The police are bad
lots, and the crooks are good lots, and the
corpse of Benny is now climbing up the
golden stairs, in the present writer’s opinion.
Plumer is the same large, loud, blustering-
bagman type of cop as usual. Frank Har-
vey and Charlotte Ives are a pair of Chicks
whose earnest utterances seem to recoil from
the silly slang they are guilty of. Eily Mal-
yon is a very satisfactory wife of the potted
burglar; Leslie Victor is obviously unsuited
to the hysterics of a dope fiend ; and Gwen
Burroughs is a festive creature who drops
in occasionally to pass caustic comments on
At last! The Revolution against the Peanut.
the limbs of the law. Boyd Irwin violently
exaggerates the brutality and meanness of
Fogarty, and Maggie Moore, Atholwood and
others play parts of no importance. For
that matter, Gwen Burroughs’s part is of
no importance, but her garments shriek for
notice, and her unconcealed sinfulness im-
parts warm glows to the proceedings.
** * *
“The Three Musketeers,” which re-
appeared at Melbourne Princess’s on Satur-
day, looks now so old-fashioned that even
the starring of Julius Knight as d’Artagnan
is scarcely good enough excuse for the
play’s survival. After all, there is nothing
especially striking about the piece wherein
Henrietta Watson and Cecil Ward achieved
an Australian success many years ago. The
three citizens of the title fail to borrow the
picturesqueness of Dumas’ originals, while
the whole bunch of warriors, including
d’Artagnan, cannot dodge the accusation of
being arrogant swaggerers too ready to draw
their blunt swords on small points of honor.
D’Artagnan for his part is further lacking-
in common gumption, for his alleged saga-
city in tracking the Queen’s necklace isn’t
equal to discovering Miladi’s transparent
guile when she dopes his wine and tries to
put him to sleep. On the evidence of that
scene d’Artagnan’s subsequent defeat of
Richelieu’s designs is only explainable on
the. assumption that his Eminence is a
beginner in diplomatic intrigue. The pre-
late reeks of cheap conspiracy and subtle
craft, and spends a lot of time in inventing
niceties of assassination to gratify an in-
temperate thirst for blud. Eardley Turner
presents, this sort of Richelieu on tradi-
tional lines. Which is to say, if Louis
XIII.’s counsellor was chiefly distinguished
for furtive eyeballs and melodramatic threats
in undertones, Turner’s conception is a faith-
ful photograph. Julius Knight as a rather
elderly d’Artagnan represents the grandeur
tl'.at is greasepaint and the glory that is
clothes. He swanks heroically through the
various scenes, making even the better-
dressed King and Count Rochefort of Arthur
Greenaway and Reynolds Denniston look
like background details. Miss Olive Wilton
as Miladi demonstrates that; there is no
rest for the wicked, and Miss Cumming as
Ann of Austria displays a colorlessness that

passes for good breeding. The musketeers
of Arthur Styan, Crosbie Ward and Harold
Moran are three scarlet tabs on the pro-
ceedings, while Jack Kirby, Henri Dore,
George Owen and others endeavor to supply
the decorative features which the scenery
lacks.
The shadow of an impending panto, will
hang over Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) until
Saturday, 18tli. Then cometh “Mother
Goose” in all its Christmas glory, not be-
cause the public really Avant a panto, to
take the children to, but because, for good
or for ill, in sunshine or rain, in sickness or
in health, they’ve simply got to have it.

The last week of the Doone season at
Melbourne King’s is divided between revi-
vals of “In Old Donegal” and “Molly
BaAvn,” both of which are usually calcu-
lated to make an Hibernian audience stamp
its feet in gladness. But -when the first-
named effusion was staged again last Satur-
day night there was only moderate enthu-
siasm for the oft-told tale of matrimonial
woe in an Irish bog; and even AA'hen Doone
represented Virtue triumphant in a green
suit and a scarlet necktie the glad toav was
noticeably scarcer than it might have been.

Hoyt s are screening the attitudes of a new
tragedienne named Sarah Adler in an emo-

Hie Tivoli’s Melbourne bill is unchanged
from last week. Looking for the highest
point of excellence in an exceptionally pleas-

or Mary Law’s turn—musical and speeta-
cular—achieves the summit in question.

Two performances of “The Messiah” by
Melbourne Philharmonic Society are to
eventuate in Christmas week, and the first of
them comes due next Tuesday. The voice of
Peter Dawson has been specially engaged.

Adelaide Royal reopens with the pawky
“Scrape o’ th’ Pen” for a single week; a
revue is to follow. Harry Roberts con-
tinues his success at the Tivoli. He takes
Shaun-the-post on quiet Allen Doone lines,
and Miss Bramley comes out well as Arrah-
na-Pogue. Darcy Kelway earns a bouquet as
the humorous old villain, and the half-cen-
tury-old “alibi” joke goes like a two-year-
old. The King’s shows some clever club-
juggling by Frank and Alice, but gives about
half the programme to a “musical travesty”
headed by Maud Miles and Bert Le Blanc,
with the stage-Hebrew flavor strong in it.
Waller’s Ideals and Branscombe’s Dandies
are in the open, on North Terrace; both are
clean and clever, and rely on team-work
rather than individual starring. There seems
to be plenty of patronage for both. Albert
Chevalier appears as a coster at West’s, C.
Chaplin as a cook at Wondergraph. Players
count for more than plays in picture-shows
these times. The I'av. is open all day, with
American “drama.”
Of a Melbourne art show
In his exhibition of pictures at Melbourne Centre-
way M. J. McNally shows a patient accumulation
of rocks and vegetable growths that suggests an
ardent statistician taking a census of the local
scenery. McNally rarely omits a detail, and he
especially enjoys putting down every twig and tree.
Whoever buys him will get plenty of firewood for
the money. In a couple of achievements-—one of
them the pleasing “Winter AVeather” —he demon-
strates a feeling for real atmosphere and sky effects;
elsewhere he mostly stands for the arboreal monotony
represented in “Bush Track” and “Dead Timber.”
McNally is almost crude in one or two oil subjects ;
and when he takes a look over the roofs of Mel-
bourne’s skyscrapers, as in the effort entitled “The
Grey City,” he gives a somewhat hazy account of
his discoveries. Fortunately he doesn’t include the
clothes-lines that festoon the tops of our highest
edifices, so, at any rate, he can be acquitted of
attempting to wash the city’s dirty linen in public.
A Maoriland schoolboy having to write a
composition on “What I Should Aim At”
produced this: —
What I Should Aim At.
A German.
The report of the Administrator of the
Northern Territory ought to finally extir-
pate the fallacy that North Australia is
quickly fatal to the white man. P. 88 shows
that the crude death-rate was 17.5 per 1000.
The death-rate from disease equalled 14.2 per
“THE THREE MUSKETEERS,” AT
MELBOCRNE PRINCESS'S.

1000, the other deaths being due to acci-
dent or misadventure. And 50 per cent, of
the total deaths occurred after 50 years of
age! “A large number of the European
deaths were those of old men,” states the
Chief Medical Officer. Everybody knows, or
ought to know, that the crude death-rate
of the Commonwealth is the lowest in the
world —-10.8 per 1000. The rate for the
United Kingdom is 13.8, while Sweden has
the same death-rate as the Northern Terri-
tory—l4.2—and one could hardly call
Sweden an unhealthy country. Scotland,
Prussia and the German Empire average
about 15.5 and France 17.5, or the same
as North Australia when all deaths are
taken into account, whether from disease or
accident. Russia runs up to 28.9, Chile to
29.7 and Ceylon to 32.4.
There are at least two schools in N. S.
Wales conducted exclusively for German
children, the closing of which is not, accord-
ing to Prime Minister Hughes, justified by
military considerations; and the other day
three German clubs in Melbourne, whose
rules and regulations are entirely in German,
coolly applied for liquor licenses —presumably
that the members may, on opportunity, re-
peat their swinish celebrations of the Lusi-
tania infamy. Meantime the Huns laugh at
the “silly, stupid Pritishers,” and have good
reason to.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“C. Oc-kney” : Re Nellie Stewart’s ill-luck
in London, alluded to by “J.F.11.” (B.
9/12/T5). “The play’s the thing” once
again. None of the plays in which Nellie

MELBOERNE PRINCESS’S.

appeared proved “the thing,” unfortunately.
“The Scarlet Feather” did not tickle Lon-
doners, and “Blue-eyed Susan” was a frost
as severe as the London winter that played
havoc with the Australian’s health when
she was principal boy at the Lane. Per-
sonally, Nellie Stewart was always a hit.
But I’ve heard many mummers declare they
would rather be a miss in a piece that was
a hit than a hit in a piece that was a miss.
For a star of course it is better—nay, essen-
tial —to be a hit in a hit.
Harry Norman, who was so long Bland
Holt’s stage manager that the job seemed
exclusively his own, is amongst the very
large batch of actors who have accepted
parts in the Big Drama. He will probably
hold a commission by the time he goes away.
“W.J.S.”: “R.F.’s” exit from his musical-
pitch controversy in a cloud of dust calls
for a final word. His use of the word “vir-
tually” is really his offence. I can produce
quite a number of men—chiefly orchestra
players—who can tell what key a song, say,
is being sung in, no matter what pitch the
organ or piano may be. And this is a more
severe test than a purely instrumental piece
affords. I can myself; and probably “R.F.”
can if he is a musician. In fact, he must be
a very poor artist indeed if he cannot; as,
devoid of this ability, he loses one of the
most vital factors necessary for adequate
interpretation. Musicians are practical
people; everything printed in the score
created by the composer is necessary for its
due performance. The key-signature is by
no means a matter of indifference. C sharp
and D flat signatures are prefixed to entirely
different brands of emotions; and these re-
main whether the pitch be high or low. My
apology for butting in is that Continental
pitch is undoubtedly the thing, and the hol-
low arguments of “R.F.” would hamper
rather than aid its adoption.
“Harness Bull” : The modern U.S. drama
is being threatened to death with revolvers.
The manufacturers don’t hesitate to get then-
characters into the most hopeless tangles,
because they know they can cut them loose
at any second by thrusting an automatic into
somebody’s hand. With an equipment of two
revolvers and little else, anyone can start
off at full gallop ; ■ then if the whole cast is
found crammed up a blind alley, one charac-
ter can back them out with their hands in
the air and start them stampeding again.
The exciting recipe works well enough for
awhile; but you soon get dead-tired of gun-
play. I doubt, however, if the U.S. drama-
tist could get anywhere without his explo-
sives.
“Ex-Gent”: I cast the dull eye of sus-
picion on the various pars of “E.N.M.,”
“YV.J.S.” and “R.F.,” re Continental as
against) Philharmonic pitch. I don’t believe
that the excitement) is warranted. Anyhow
here is my wager. I will risk a pack of cards
that the whole eight initials combined can’t
tell at first hearing which pitch is being
used. Ability to do this would connote
the faculty of absolute pitch which is as
rare as a pink sparrow and about as useful.
The idea that pitch alteration of a frac-
tional part of a note means a change of key
is quite fantastic, as any decent harmony
manual will explain. Anyway, it is a fear-
ful fuss about half a note when there are
millions of whole promissory notes coming
due and requiring urgent attention.
Jean Brola, formerly of the Quinlan co.,
is now with Beecham at the Shaftesbury,
London. Beecham’s new Irish tenor, O’Brien,
is considered a find. When the war broke
out he was studying at Milan, whither he
had journeyed on the strength of a prize won
at an Irish competition. The O’Brien’s
top C is said to be something sensational,
and altogether he is a broth of a b’y en-
toirely.
“Glenhuntly”: What is the secret of
Repertory dressing? Each time I visit one
of Gregan McMahon’s shows I try to fathom
it. The people who attend are not all poor
but intellectual; some are absurdly wealthy,
and yet they do things on the same scale
of lavish inexpensiveness as the others. I
examined the house the other evening, and
nine out of ten of the women seemed to be
hung with cretonne curtains or green and
red tablecloths. And even these were not
worn in the strict sense of the word, but
caught their owners as the latter were rush-
ing for their trains. No, it is not war
economy. It has been going on for a long
time, and I am pining for an explanation.
“ Ho Ho” According to “Mid-Channel”
(B. 2/12/T5), “a great proportion of
present-day playgoers belong to the Stinking
E ish brigade,” and “don’t care for Austra-
lia.n plays.’’ These are the statements of a
Stinking Fishmonger. Practically any Aus-
tralian play that is not hopeless can rely
upon a good reception from local theatre-
goers if its author can only manage to get it
on the boards. Nobody can pretend that
“The Squatter’s Daughter” was superior to
a dozen imported melodramas of a similar
class; but) what Yankee or English bellow
of recent years has proved such a money-
maker ?. Only a critic suffering from a rush
of patriotism to the head could place the
stage version of “On Our Selection” above
a play like “Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage
Patch”; yet the Bert Bailey people
would not exchange their profits for a couple
of months of “On Our Selection” for the
entire Australian takings of “Mrs. Wiggs.”
Jo Smith’s unexciting Australian dramas
have made a profit for their author almost
solely on the strength of their local appeal.
Bilanderson made a fortune out of Austra-
lian drama, and lost much of it with im-
ported stuff. Australian plays have made
Bert Bailey, Ned Duggan and Julius Grant
affluent; but of the half-dozen imported
pieces, of fair average quality, produced by
this firm, not one has caused anything like
the same rush on the box-office. And even
in these lean times we have the spectacle
of “The Waybacks” coining shekels, while
imported productions, mostly of a better
quality (although this must not be regarded
as extravagant praise), are just managing to
keep the wolf from the treasury. Having
regard to these facts, the person who accuses
Australian audiences of adopting a Stinking
Fish attitude towards Australian plays can
have had very little experience of local
theatrical affairs of recent years.
“Harrison O.” : Although the first contri-
bution towards “National Australian Drama”
exposed at the Oakleigh private theatre was
not as inspiring as it might have been, the
two enthusiasts who support the place hope
that they may yet discover a Moliere, or a
Strindberg guiltless of his country’s blud-
geons. Australian playwrights are therefore
implored to let- Mr. and Mrs. Davidson see
their brain children. The promoters hope
with the aid of subscriptions to be able to
award a couple of prizes annually for the
two best babies, and as the “Free National
Theatre” was in danger of becoming a
W.P.B. for MSS. judiciously declined by the
Repertory people, it is now announced that
plays will be read by “a Board of readers
composed of intellectuals of education and
experience.”
“Pip” : When George Titheradge appeared
at Sydney Royal in 1883 he had as associ-
ates Pattie Brown, G. W. Anson and Phil
Beck. Pattie and Anson provided the low
comedy part in “Human Nature.” Anson
was a red-headed clerk with poetical procliv-
ities and a gorgeous appetite. When he
wasn’t reciting poetry lie was eating sand-
wiches. The co. also played “Harbor
Lights” and “Silver King.” Not long after-
wards Phil Beck committed suicide on one
of the Islands. Pattie Brown was always a
prime favorite in Sydney. Remember her
“Saucers” (“because me eyes is big”) in
“A Bit of Old Chelsea”?
A new play by Knoblanch, author of
“Kismet,” is announced for early produc-
tion in London and New York. It is in
three acts and founded on an incident in
the life of Paginini, which occurred during
his visit to England in 1834. It seems that
a daughter of a London musical magnate
fell violently in love with the long-haired
wizard, and "Knobby’s” imagination is
powerful enough to suggest what ought to
have happened. Margery Maude, the
daughter of actor-manager Cyril, has been
selected to fall in love with the cranky
fiddler. The fiddler has not been nominated
so far. lie will need some finding. Young
actors capable of fiddling like an angel and
looking romantic in long hair are scarce.
“H.”: “Australia’s Leading Comedian.”
It is on a placard outside the Oxford, one
of the oldest of London variety houses, inti-
mating that W. S. Percy is about to appear
in “a farcical comedy witli music entitled
‘Who’s Who.’ ” Percy is to be abetted by
Blanche Browne.
(Continued on page 39.)
The Trades Union Amendment Act, which
has gone through the N.S.W. Assembly, and
now has to face a hostile Council, has one
definite purpose—to get the unions out
of an awkward hole in connection with the
levies for the Labor daily. A number of
unions which supported that project were
brought up with a round turn, when, after
collecting large amounts through levies upon
members, they commenced to squeeze mem-
bers who had failed to pay. A member of
the Railway Workers’ Union was prosecuted
for failing to part up, whereupon the Indus-
trial Court dropped in a bomb and held that
the levies were illegal. This put a stop to
further collections, and a lot of money that
the unions had guaranteed has, therefore, not
been mobilised. The Bill legalises the levies ;
and, if it passes, The World, which already
has a substantial sum at command, a large
building and the necessary printing plant,
may be able to announce still another date
for publication.
“D.F.” :The Tasmanian fruitgrower lias had
a jim-jam lifted off his chest. Navy Minister
Jensen has fixed the freight at last year’s
rates —655. per ton of 40 cubic feet —plus 20
per cent., or 78s. altogether. Even this
works out at nearly 3s. 6d. per case. If
there is a good crop, as seems likely, the
freight will be just about half the market
value of the fruit delivered on the wharf in
Australia—unless the overseas market jumps.
As with the wheat export the Federal Gov-
ernment has got a couple of big firms (Perry
and Co., of Melbourne, and Jones and Co., of
Hobart) to handle the shipping business.
Gone to the tombs of the Canterbury
Wool Kings, William Oliver Rutherford,
one of the big, raw-boned family which
shears the biggest fleece in Maoriland and
once had Amuri as a principality. W. 0.,
who was almost as tremendous in size as
Andrew and Duncan, was born in N. S.
Wales 72. years ago, but his early years
from feeding-bottle to slate-rag were spent
in South Aus. He was 15 when his father
invaded Canterbury 55 years back. They
dug themselves in at Leslie Hills, from
Culverden to Hanrner, but later W. O.
started out on his own account, and in ’76
he took over Montrose, on the other side of
the Waiau, and held it until the Great
Shearer got him. Unlike Andrew he didn’t
seek political honors, but confined his public
life to Rabbit Boards and Country Councils.
He did a little racing, but principally
minded his own business of growing sheep,
and mighty well he did out of it, too, for
they got in on the early door, these Ruther-
fords, and couldn’t have missed the bull’s-
eye if they had tried.
“Jackar” sees a good man off: —
Dr. Harry Oswin Johnson, who died recently at
Parkes (N.S.W.), where he had practised for over 25
years, was deservedly the most popular man in that
district. His was a remarkable personality. For
many years he had been afflicted with lupus, which,
starting as a mere speck in the neck, gradually
extended until it covered nearly the whole of his
face and one side of his head. He had consulted the
leading specialists of the world in skin diseases, and
had undergone several skin-grafting operations, but
nothing checked the spread of the horrible disease
or relieved the ghastliness of it. Latterly he had to
wear a mask. Despite the distressing, disfiguring
affliction he was amiability itself—a man of smiles
and witticisms. His g'eniality knew no distinction
of pel sons. Rich and poor alike were spontaneously
attracted by the magnetism of his gracious, bonhomie.
His generosity was as unbounded as unostentatious.
He was an all-round “sport” in the fullest sense. In
art he was an aesthete; as a host delightful, and
altogether one of Nature’s noblemen.
Rufus George, who died at Sydney last
week, at 82, was in early life a contractor,
and then took up photography. But it was
in sporting circles he was best known; he
was the father of cycling in Australia, and
graduated from the old bone-shaker through
every stage up to the motor-car which he
drove until liis sight failed a few years ago.

A REBUKE FROM THE DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The “First Old Man” felt sore and sick;
The “gods” weren’t good unto him ;
His .mumming they could never “stick,”
Always they’d guy and booh him ;
If they’d their way,
They used to say,
From off the boards they’d shoo him.
He doddered on one night to act
A character heroic ;
His pants were short, his boots were cracked,
His hat was paleozoic.
The “push” aloft
Most rudely scoffed.
He stood it like a Stoic
Until the time for his decease
Came. Bang! A shot! He totters !
Ribald “Hoorays!” and laughs increase;
He falls, turns up his trotters 1
A corpse he libs,
Then sits up, eyes
The gods and cries:
“Respect the dead, you rotters!”

“Trooper Bluegum”: “W.A.R.” (B.
8/7/T5), who wants sudden death distri-
buted wholesale, is only half right. Here
on Gallipoli the machine gun can’t get you
unless you rush a trench or poke your head
over the parapet, while if you get on the
right side of the hills the high explosives
are only fireworks. It’s the bomb here every
time. Our chaps have never been machine-
gunned out of any trench they have captured
from Abdul, but once or twice the bomb has
effected a temporary eviction. Here, with
the trenches only a few yards apart, this
is the only thing to hit with. We’re
back to the days of the grenadiers, and bomb
parties have the time of their lives night
after night. It’s far more exciting than a
w T ake. Some of our cricketers catch the
Turks’ bombs and throw them back before
they can explode. Some time back a few of
ours failed to work. Abdul re-lit
them and sent them back with his compli-
rnents. Some of the Light Horsemen then
conceived the pretty idea of sending a few
instantaneous-fuse bombs into the opposing
trench just for fun. When Abdul lit them
to throw them back he had a most sultry
time. We always pass a few compliments
when we send the bombs next door- Mostly
it’s: “Here’s luck, Abdul!” At other times
the bombers say things that mother never
taught them.
Melbourne’s sudden police-campaign against
fortune-tellers has resulted in a few dozen
convictions, with fines up to £5. The only
one to exceed this limit so far has been Alice
Harper, of South Yarra. A remarkable
feature of her case was that she called Chief
Commissioner Sainsbury as a witness in her
defence! It appeared from her evidence
that about 18 months ago Sainsbury had
written a letter (produced) containing the
following statement: “I have to inform you
that the manner in which you conduct your
business is within the law.” The fatherly
Alexander McKinnon, chairman of the
Prahran Bench, having earnestly rebuked the
Chief Commissioner, remarked that the de-
fendant in charging ss. a sitting had “put
herself on a higher plane than the other
fortune-tellers who had lately been fined
£5”; so he made the fee £7 10s. Since
then Sainsbury has made the usual “brief
statement”; but it doesn’t make the too-
impressionable commissioner look any less
foolish.
“Eddyson” introduces his friend Pitt:—
Pitt lived in a southern suburb. He had a five-
roomed villa of his own on a half-acre block. He
was about 40 when I first met him, some 25 years
ag’o; a bachelor, and without relations apparently.
He did his own housekeeping, and did it remarkably
well; he was a short, clean-shaven man of many
dimples, and the sight of him, pipe in mouth, and
up to his elbows in suds, was a diverting spectacle.
His house was neatly furnished. “The wife'll like
it, don’t you think?” he said. “The wife?” I
queried. “Yes. When I get her, you know.” “Oh!”
I said. “See,” said he, “I want to have the place
right into the wife’s hands.” “Engaged?” I asked.
“Oh, no. Oh, dear, no!” he replied. “But a man's
bound to marry.” He made a beautiful lawn. “Don’t
care much for lawns myself,” he said. “This is
entirely for the missus.” He planted gum-trees in
his yard. “The wife’ll like ’em,” he said.
I missed visiting Pitt for three months or more:
then business brought us into touch again. He had
erected a substantial swing in the backyard. “For
the kiddies,” he explained. “But,” I faltered, “you
haven’t married?” He shook his head. “Not yet.
A man must, though; and all the kiddies like a
swing. Just look at this, will you ?” He led me
into the wash-house. It was a model wash-house,
with half a score of labor-saving contrivances.
“That’ll suit the wife down to the ground,” he said.
“You’re a married man. Do you know of anything
else the wife would be likely to want?” “But,” said
I, “why in Heaven don’t you begin at the begin-
ning?” “Oh, that’s all right,” said Pitt. “Lots o’
time for that.” Meanwhile he put about £5O
worth of good wood and honest labor into a sort of
double-action seesaw for the children. He established
a vegetable garden that was a miracle of neatness, and
which produced amazingly. “They all like a good
kitchen garden, these wives,” said Pitt.
A man’s rise here is from suburb to suburb. The
suburbs, socially speaking, are in an ascending scale,
I have reached St. Kilda in 30 years, and am parted
from Pitt by at least three suburbs. We had not
met in over 20 years, when I ran against him the
other day. “Married yet?” I asked. He shook his
head. “But mv little place is about ready,” he
said. “You should come and see the nursery I’ve
built. It’s a miracle. Everything in it you could
thiv*k of.” And so it had—everything but children.
HUSSY.
“What, not speakin' to Sis Green note ?”
“Mo. I found after I kissed her a bit she
got too familiar.”
“One reformed man is a far greater credit
to a prison system than all the terrorising
attributes with which old-fashioned people
would endow r gaol,” says a Melbourne
prison reformer. Yes, it’s as the old saw
says—“An honest man’s the noblest work
of quod.”
Undeterred by history, the City Council
at Ballarat lately talked over the question of
curfewing the town to keep young girls
indoors after 9.30. The assembled whiskers
did not know, however, whether such a
regulation would be lawful or not, so they
sent to get their lawyer’s opinion. And
then the disappointing news came back that
the suggested hobble would be outside the
provisions of the Local Government Act;
whereupon the Council shook its bald head
dejectedly, twice up-and-down and three
times sideways, and went gloomily on with
a matter of city drainage. So nothing will
be done to send the little rabbits back to
their burrows as soon as church or the pic-
tures are over—unless Alec Peacock decides
shortly to introduce a Local Government
Act Amending Bill; and as that would im-
mediately bring the whole municipal system
buzzing around his ears. Peacock will no
doubt let Lulu stay out all night.

“Albanius”: A strange and memorable
sight was. presented at the execution of two
Bengali ringleaders of the recent Singapore
military riots. At sunset on the day fixed
for the job a vast crowd, possibly the most
cosmopolitan in the world, moved slowly
towards a slope overlooking the wall of the
barracks. Before long the hill was a blaze
of Oriental color, with the brilliant tropical
sun pouring down its rays on an amphi-
theatre of gorgeously-attired natives. In
silence the two condemned were led out and
stood before the wall, and their death sen-
tence was proclaimed in the many various
languages of the races present, so that all
might understand that justice was being
done. Five soldiers then faced each man.
The red sun sank behind the hill; slowly and
quietly the crowds moved and gradually dis-
appeared, profoundly impressed.
“Bill o’ Costs” :
These periodical
raids on the fortune-
telling sisterhood —
and occasionally bro-
therhood —a r e in-
effective because. the
law misses the right
remedy, or seizes
upon only half of it.
There are two parties
to the fortune-telling
futility. Why not
treat the “clients”
as the criminal law
treats aiders, abet-
tors and accessories?
If I persuade Mr.
Bung to dispense, me
a prohibited whisky
on the Sabbath we
are both liable to a
fine. This has a pro-
nounced effect upon
my morals and thirst.
It makes me at least
as careful as Bung
to see that the coast
is clear. Judges are
fond, too, of telling
juries that if there
were no receivers
there would be few
thieves. Why not
make it penal for
Bridget and Ermyn-
trude to purchase
“revelations,” know-
ing them to be fraud-
nlent, so to speak? The appearance of
these ladies before the beak, in company
with the “clairvoyant” impostor, would go
a long way further towards suppressing the
latter than the present annual raids and
the- levying of annual license fees —I mean
fines —of £5 or so.

The third wing of the Adelaide Public
Library and Museum was opened last week.
It is to be called the “Australian Court,” a
title justified only by the rare and im-
mensely valuable collection of abo. things
inside. The original wing, which at first
housed library, museum and art gallery, was
built end-on to North Terrace. Then a large
but unpretentious red-brick museum was
built on at a right angle, at the back of the
available land. The new wing runs up to
the Terrace again, and is a close copy, ex-
ternally, of the first one. The fourth side of
the square, being the frontage to North Ter-
race, is left for the future to deal with. The
original building is now a library only, the
Art Gallery being close by, but in a separate
building, and official headquarters being in
the new wing.

“Handfed” : The Lord knows I try to be
a gentleman and eat like one ; but perhaps
picnicking has ruined my table manners.
Either that or else these tearoom women
expect too much of me. I had what was
alleged to be a meal at a stylish pie-studio
lately, and the cold, proud waitress asked
me in a severe voice if I wouldn't like some
fruit. I said “Yea” in a respectful tone,
and the icy maiden floated away and re-
turned with a small plate on which reposed
an impossible, apple, 10 and a half cherries
and two morose-looking bananas. She slid
the lot in front of me with a look of de-
spair. (I don’t know what it was for, but
she had it on. ) She then went out with
her nose in the air. I was just about to
take on one of the dejected bananas in my
two bare hands and coarsely rip the peel
off, when the perfect-lady waitress reap-
peared with a fork like a fire-tongs and a
knife as large as a sword. She threw the
clanking implements in front of me and
retreated, wearing a look of relief and ex-
haustion. (I don't know what that was
for either, but she wore it.) I looked doubt-
fully at the dissecting implements on the
cold marble slab and then at the two sullen
bananas, alley were green on their under-
sides and resembled grass snakes. I decided
not to eat them. The duchess at the cash
register allowed me to pay fid. for shuddering
at them, and I escaped into the street.
Again, last night I went into another tomb
and ordered some cake. The lady-waitress
retired into a cave, the entrance of which
was masked with two palm-leaf fans and
a Japanese screen. In due course the
princess who had condescended to listen
to my prayer for light refreshment
came forth from this tabernacle hearing two
plates, a small slice of cake, a fork which
didn’t invite close inspection, and a pudding
spoon. But this time I was hungry and
was prepared to outrage public opinion. I
put the machinery aside with a firm hand
and ate by hand just as I would have done
at home in my bone-strewn cavern. Some
day I’m going to try an experiment. I’ll
go into a really first-class foodshop and
order a whole pineapple. I haven’t the
slightest idea what sort of tackle is con-
sidered the correct thing for pineapple, but
I wouldn’t be astonished if they brought me
a fan and a long pole.
STEEL EMBROIDERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a craze for steel embroideries. —Fashion
note.
Broidered with steel the nations’ cloaks are thrown
Over the ragged remnants of their pride;
Their stricken hosts by winter’s winds o’erblown
Stand in the tracks where legions fought and died ;
But the steel edging glitters in the night,
Star-smitten, through the frosts that sear and bite.
The strong men suffer and the women keep
Their courage high to face the doubtful end.
Wild harvests yet the war’s red scythe shall reap,
But hope is steadfast, with no tears to spend.
Keen, fearless, hiding that they know and feel,
The women walk in broidery of steel.
Meet is the emblem. Silver glitters free
Its sign of banquet, and bright gold may gleam
In happier days when laughing eyes shall see
Peace, like a swan, full breasted take the stream ;
But, while the lips smile well with bitter art,
Let hard steel be embroidered round the heart.

You’d know at once by seeing me
That I am harmless as can be;
Mv job is fair as business goes—
Insurance clerk at Brown and Co.’s.
I have to go about the town
To every office up and down ;
But at the counters now I see
Nice girls where fellows used to be.
And this is now what puzzles me
About these girls I daily see:
When I meet them the crowd amid,
Outdoors, then should I raise my lid?
The other night I met Miss Green,
Of Black and Co.’s, at five-fifteen ;
I raised my hat, but with a frown
As black as pitch she turned me down.
And then I met Miss Vandeleur, >
Of White and Co.’s. Afraid of her
I went to pass. She said aloud:
“The bald old stuck-up thing is proud!”
And with my wife the other day
I bowed to fluffy Miss O’Shea,
Our shorthand girl. My wife said: “James!
At last I’ve found you at your games!”
She won’t believe me yet, and so
I swore I’d try and get to know
Exactly what the others did.
So tell me, do you raise your lid ?

“Verdad” on the Bulldog Breed (Chilean
strain) :
Many of the leading Chilean families have English
blood in them, and English names appear plenti-
fully in Chilean history. Lord Cochrane did all
sorts of impossible things with the Chilean fleet, such
as capturing the strongly-fortified harbor of Corral,
which was the headquarters of the Spanish army
during the Chilean War of Independence. Cochrane
had only two ships and 160 men all told, and had
received express orders from the piebald Govern-
ment not to go near Corral. He called his officers
to a council, told them his orders, explained that
Corral was impregnable, remarked that he had
always found impregnable positions the most inter-
esting to attack, and hinted that the Government
would no doubt forgive the disobedience when they
returned victorious. His men were willing, so he
sailed into Corral, and as his fleet of two ships was
so insignificant he was not fired on.' The people
came down to the wharf to see the picnic. The
picnickers chased the people into the first fort,
following so closely on their heels that they got
inside the fort before the gates could be closed.
Having captured it, they turned the guns on the
next fort, taking- in that way each in succession
right round the harbor. Cochrane was naturally
exonerated by the piebald Government. He used to
do similar things about once a week. Other well-
known names in Chile are O’Higgins and Prat.
There are statues to all these men. The Edwards
family is well known there also. They are nowadays
thoroughgoing Chileans, and own a bank and the
newspaper El Mercurio. Agustin Edwards is
Chilean Minister in London, and his establishment
there is said to be more lavishly run than any other
embassy or legation in England—except, of course,
that of the Australian High Commissioner.
POWDER AND SHOT.
HE: “Well, she's not as had as she's
painted."
SHE: “She couldn't he. But she’s quite as

THE REVUE OF FASHION—WHAT
NEXT?
“The Religious Editor,” while waiting for
the drought to break: —
He was a nice, mild-looking old gentleman—as
nice an old gentleman as I have ever encountered
in a dusty tram. The skies were using- threatening
language, and it really seemed as if we might get a
shower or two. Directly the conversation started he
explained his system: “Whenever I want an umbrella
I steal it. I hate getting wet, and I hate carrying
umbrellas; but I don’t mind buying them —in
reasonable quantities, that is. I buy six umbrellas
a year on six wet days, and when the rain’s over I
lose them —just leave them wherever I may happen
to be when it clears up. I then consider myself
entitled to find an umbrella when I need it. I have
banked six umbrellas with the world ; I am entitled,
therefore, to draw six umbrellas. I endeavor not to
take them from women and children. I always try
to collect from pompous men who look as if they can
afford cabs, and young vigorous fellows who should
be at the Front and to whom a wetting or two
doesn't matter. Oh, yes, I have been caught; but
nobody would dare to accuse a man like me of
attempting to wilfully steal such a trifle as an
umbrella. Men in my position are only tempted by
trust funds, and so forth—umbrellas and doormats
are beneath our notice!
“ J.G.”: The old fire-station and
high watch-tower erected for the In-
surance fire brigade in Little Bourke-
street, Melbourne, over 30 years ago,
and now used as a branch station of
the Metropolitan brigade, is to be
pulled down. The old brigade was
established and maintained by the in-
surance cos., who were not over-
whelmed with faith in the then volun-
teers, run by Sam Mauger. D. J.
Stein, of the London Fire Brigade,
was brought out to boss the new lot.
The rivalry between the two was soon
so intense that it was quite a common
thing to see the men, after they had
raced to a fire, fighting each other in-
stead of the flames. Or one gang, get-
ting the first water on to the fire,
would be swooped upon by a stronger
force of the enemy, and they and their
hydrants and hoses bundled away from
the plugs. These rows, though amus-
ing to spectators, proved expensive to
both insurance cos. and property-
holders, as fires generally burnt them-
selves out whilst the stousli went on.
Also, it began to dawn upon the Gov-
ernment and the City Council that
some day a fire would get away and
wipe out the metropolis. So the rival
shows were turned down and the pre-
sent brigade established, with another
watch-tower upon Eastern Hill. Stein,
of the Insurance brigade, was ap-
pointed to the same office in the new
brigade, and Mauger was solaced with
the chairmanship of the Fire Board.
At last the worm has turned and the
head of one London hospital has replied to
quite an eminent actress: “The men have
been entertained so much lately that we
must give them a rest on Sundays.”
‘ The Old Soldier” :
I can remember many
willing fights between
the artillery of the
Woolwich . (Eng.) Gar-
rison and the local
division of marines.
No one ever expected
the civil police to keep
the peace on those
occasions. Had they
tried, gunners and
marines would have
joined forces against
them. Instead, strong
pickets were sent out,
and the combatants
were separated by
superior force. If there
was any suspicion of
trouble the garrison
was ordered to tell-off
(say) 20 or 30 men
daily for picket, with
an officer and three or
four N.0.0.’5, to pat-
rol the town. In ordi-
nary circumstances one
or two of these parties
were enough, and the
rest, after being
marched out to ascer-
tain that all as quiet,
were marched back
again with the under-
standing that they
were to be ready if
required. That sys-
tem is quite well
known and constantly
practised in the Brit-
ish army all over the
world ; and if it were
not for the absurd taint of amateurish-
ness that pervades the Australian forces
and the dread with which every attempt to
make discipline a reality in Australia itself
is viewed, we should not have had these so-
called “riots.”
The Red Cross collector put the matter
to Cocky, and after a long argument he
agreed to give something. Then she went
to the next paddock and saw his brother.
“Has Bill given anything?” he asked. “Oh.
yes,” said the maiden; “Bill has promised
to contribute sixpence a week.” “Ah,”
drawled the backbone of the country as he
gazed at Bill’s signature, “just alter the
name to Hayseed Brothers, will you?”

“G. St.” : Through the w'indow we watched
the process at the back of the hash castle.
On a rough bench where the sunlight and
hies played happily together the various
viands were assembled, the steam rising
with a silver sheen above the white cap
that presided over
the show. The man’s
arms were bare to
the elbow, and as
girls in white aprons
and black gowns
tripped to and fro
bearing full and
empty plates, h e
served the meat and
vegetables with a
dexterity which sur-
prised us. But the
means by which he
maintained his speed
surprised us more.
Not a fork was in
evidence through the
whole operation.
Meat, vegetables,
sweet s—a 11 were
handled in the same
way by the ruffian in
the white cap. Since
then I have learned
that the practice is
pretty general in
grill rooms and curry
castles, and I now
rise to say that the
filthy practice has
gone on long enough,
and a stern example ought to be made of
any beast caught mauling veal or cauliflower
with his hands.

The Tasmanian court that inquired into
the loss of the steamer Nord,' which recently
hit a rock between the Hippolytes and went
to the bottom, handed a bouquet of thistles
to the Admiralty chart and the sailing direc-
tions. Though the existence of the rock
on which the vessel struck has been known
to local mariners for years, and even though
a steamer was wrecked on it or thereabouts
in 1883, yet the chart does not show any
sign of the obstacle, and the sailing direc-
tions issued in 1907 declare there is 50
fathoms of water for a vessel to swim
through. Therefore the Court was of
opinion that the master, Captain Mackay,
was navigating his vessel with due care,
but that the chart and the sailing directory
ought to be prosecuted for false pretences.
“481” from Pharaoh’s late residence;-! —
A queer custom of the Egyptian attends the return
of a woman from hospital, cured. A mixed-looking
band goes forth from the gates, with a fearful din
of tom-toms and pipes. Then follows a. carriage
bearing the discharged patient, who is accompanied
by two or three other women. From time to time
she rises, bowing and smiling, and sometimes sing-
ing, as the procession rags through the streets.
Behind the carriage runs a bob-tailed collection of
Arabs, making enough row to almost drown the
music. ’ The Bedouin have their own way of
celebrating an approaching wedding. Every night
for about a week before the fatal date a crowd
gathers just about dusk. The men place themselves
in a half-circle, and an old sinner makes a noise
that conveys an impression that he is being tor-
tured. In reality he is singing a Bedouin love song.
The others help the show by clapping their hands
in unison. F'rom the women squatting silently around
there advances a young wife, heavily veiled. To
the rhythm of the clapping she dances a weird sara-
band, gradually increasing in pace as the clapping
grows faster, and culminating in an exciting whirl-
wind. The programme is continued for hours
and the noise can be heard until you’ve run more
than a mile.

“ Houlevardier” : The making of passports
for adventurous Australians who want to
get away from safety into danger threatens
to become a big business. The applicant has
to describe himself, tell his age, state
whether his eyes are grey with yellow
whites, or brown with red whites; define
whether his nose is Roman, broken, or merely
red ; own up whether his mouth is wide or
long or deep; locate his favorite mole,
wart, wen, polypus or carbuncle; confess
whether his hair is grey, carroty or simply
missing; explain if his forehead be low or
broad or high ; advise as to the shape of his
chin and whether he thinks it retreats or
occupies a salient. Then he gets his photo-
graph taken and hands it in and in return
for all this and ten bob receives a folio as
big as King O’Malley’s hat stating that he
is a fit and proper person to go outside
the Heads. The seal on the Commonwealth
passport is large and red, something like the
plan of an allotment offered at a Saturday-
afternoon suburban land sale. This seal has a
real monetary value of its own. Once I
borrowed money from a Chitty in Travan-
core (India) on the strength of that seal
THE PLEASURES OF WEALTH.
“It must be lovely having so much money.”
“Oh, it is — why, I'm sending my wife away

and Alfred Deakin’s signature, and a Chitty
is a fairly hard man to beat. As I write,
three travel-stained British passports lie
on the table. The first is dated ISS4, and is
signed by Granville. The second was given
ar the Foreign Office, London, on July 22,
1889, by R. A. T. G. Cecil, Marquess of
Salisbury. The third bears date Feb. 28.
1901, and the signature of H. C. Iv. P.
Fitz Maurice, Marquess of Lansdowne. They
have been vise all over the world, and their
chief virtues nowadays are the memories
they hatch and the fact that they cost only
sixpence apiece.

printer’s error in contracting a Christian

Adelaide has handed to Alan Simpson, its
recent mayor, the unusual experience of a
beating at the poll after two years’ service.
Isaacs, a strong alderman, thought two years
enough, and stood against him for the mayor-
alty ; there were many voters who reckoned
a third year a luxury, to be granted only for
special services; and Labor, without being
specially fond of Isaacs, likes Simpson less.
So, between the three factors, Simpson went
down in five of the six city wards. He
was the last of the “young” men—men with
fathers much better known than themselves
—who butted into municipal affairs at the
beginning of the century. Lavington Bony-
thon worked up to the mayoralty and then
retired. John Baker retired after being
beaten by Cohen in 1909. Since then there
has been no contest till now. Isaacs this
time —Cohen then. Isaacs is on the up-grade.
A Victorian, who moved to Adelaide 10
years ago, he went into the City Council
almost at once, and for years he has been
chairman of the finance committee, and a
member of the Municipal Tramways Trust.

Old Henry Parkes’s youngest son, Cobden,
has come back from the Dardanelles badly
hurt in the right hand. The youngster, a
lieutenant, is now 22, so papa was 78 at

something solid jto his credit.
As the train dashed towards Mary-
borough (Q.) the other day at fully 10
miles an hour the. funny-looking little man
who had beguiled the time by nursing and
playing with a kiddy he had chummed up
with, put his head out of the window.
Looking back through the years he saw him-

self plodding along that road with a bundle
on his back. Then the train ran over a creeit.
“Why,” said the little man to his casual
playmate, “that’s where I lost the only boots
I had. They dropped off my swag. It took
me half an hour to get them again,” and
the little playmate asked the little man to
tell him all about it. But there was no
one handy to tell him that the little man
was the Prime Minister of Australia.
“Try Fluke” : Old Donald Sutherland, of
Milford Sound (M.L.), still keeps well to
windward of the man with the scythe.
Donald is the red-bearded old
bushman —he is in bis seventies
—who first set eyes on the big-
gest waterfall in Australasia;
the M.L. Survey Department
named it after him. That was
more than 30 years ago; but
Donald hints of plenty more
wonderful things in the mos-
quito-ridden bush thereabouts
if the Government would make
it worth his while to go and
find them. Sutherland gold-
prospected and seal-hunted and
explored the soggy fiordland for
more than 40 years. Some day
—when Donald is dead —I’ll
write a bookful of all the yarns
the old man has spun to me
over the whisky—of deer-
poaehing; hard-case days in a
“Geordie” brig; pulling an oar
with a transport corps on the
Waikato; bush-whacking the
Hauhaus and head-hunting in
the Taranaki war; and the
frontispiece will be a picture of
Donald in his waist-shawl and little else,
swagging in with his day’s take of rebel
heads for Whitmore’s reward.
Some sort of a link with the Burke and
Wills party has just snapped in the hospital
at Maldon (Vic.), aged 75. Andrew Farrell
in the early days was a carrier, and helped
to land the expedition at Swan Hill. He
settled down to farming, and was for many
years a councillor of Maldon Shire. John
Farrell, brewer and poet, once editor of
Sydney Telegraph, was his brother.
Oliver Hogue (“Billy Bluegum”) is likely
to be the next Australian to see his name at
the front of a war-book. As Oliver the sou
has written, James the father —once editor
of Sydney Evening News— has got the
stuff ready for a publisher in London. Young
Hogue, who went with the strenuous Light
Horse, has lately been convalescing in
London and trying to pick up 3st. he dropped
in the trenches.
Retired the other day, H. Davidson, for
the last 11 years Chief Accountant of
Maoriland Railways. He joined the service
in 1877 as a station-master, but was soon
turned on to figures and has been browsing
on them ever since—first at
Christchurch, subsequently in
the head office at Wellington.
General Efficiency was his
A.D.C., and between them
they made their branch of the
department almost, a model.
The cableman told us re-
cently that “Dr. Leahy, who
is stout, was knocked about”
when the Marquette was tor-
pedoed, and if that is right
his friends will have a double
cause of grief, for when Leahy
left for Egypt early in the
year he was like unto Cassius.
A fat Leahy is as unthink-
able as a gross Adonis. He
is a graduate of Sydney medi-
cal school and a score of years
ago went across the Tas-
man to take charge of the
Napier Hospital, and subse-
quently settled down to a
comfortable private practice.
Another medical man on the
unlu c k y Marquette was
Frazer-llurst, who before
taking his stethoscope to
Wliangarei, north of Auck-
land, had seen military ser-
vice in China and Africa. A
couple of years ago he came
into violent collision with the
Health Department at Well-
ington by insisting that the
outbreak of “smallpox” which
struck Sydney and the Loanly
Isles about that time was not
smallpox at all. The Lieut.-
Col. McGavin, referred to as
being in charge of all the
nurses and doctors aboard, is
a Wellington practitioner
with a very considerable
clientele amongst the other
sex. His wife is a sister of that
Dr. Chappie who with historian Robert
McNab and others made much money out
of the Moturoa swamp deal, and then bolted
away to Scotland and became Liberal M.P.
for Stirlingshire.

Grit? There’s nothing amiss with Private
O’Leary, of the Ist Battalion (N.S.W.).
Invalided recently to Australia with 14
punctures, he set to work to' get well with
just as much enthusiasm as he had pro-
ceeded to get holes drilled in him, and last
week said “Hurroo!” and went into camp
again.
Among the Australian
wounded in England is a Mili-
tary College boy who broke
records in getting a captaincy.
Henry Boyle left Australia as
lieutenant in the 14th Bat-
talion and landed in (Jal-
lipoli in charge of the machine-
gun section. He was wounded
in the first week and was men-
tioned in despatches. Return-
ing from Egypt after getting
well he was again in the thick
of trouble, and was in charge
of a party when Jacka
won his V.C. Again the
youngster was mentioned in
despatches and received his cap-
taincy for “conspicuous ser-
vice.” though he is not yet out
of his teens. He is a Victorian country lad
who went to St. Pat’s before proceeding to
Duntroon.
With quite unusual ingenuity Fate
arranged that there should be the very man
in Melbourne to take the place of Walter
von Decliend. teacher of German at the Mel-
bourne University, when the latter _ was
passed over by the University council in
pursuance of its resolution relating to the
employment of “unnaturalised citizens of
any enemy country.” Dr. Lodewyk, who
has been a teacher at Melbourne Grammar
School for a couple of years, is yon Dech-
eud's successor—and he is a Belgian. The
tall, reserved, sword-slashed von Dechend
was in the early days of the Glaeiarium
almost an appanage of the Madden party;
but at the Uni. council proceedings the all-
British attitude of Chancellor John was
everything that could have been desired.
The Y.M.C.A. at Melbourne is sending
Ernest Peacock to Egypt on a business mis
sicn. He is to tie up any loose ends tha

edges, and extend the troops’ facilities tor
getting a cheap bath, a book to read, and a
place in which to sit when oft: duty, with
the opportunity of buying light refreshments
at bedrock rates. This Peacock is the man

THE EMBRACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘The Kaiser would gladly embrace peace, but pride
stands in the way, and must do so till his spirit is
broken. What he hopes for is that peace may per-
force seek to embrace him.”
Tlie Kaiser came up from the field
Of blood and fire, and stood in shade
Where roses gave their gracious yield
To scented air, and pansies prayed ;
And there among the sweet increase
Of mother Earth stood smiling Peace.
The Kaiser calmly eyed her o’er,
Then eagerly he met her glance ;
But. in liis arms the tyrant bore,
All dripping still, a limb of France,
With Belgium drawing faintest breath,
And Servia stifled close to death.
“’Tis Peace, I see,” the Kaiser said—
“A charming dame! My people strive
To have me haste with thee to wed
That they may save their souls alive.
Thee I’d embrace with joy, but see
My arms are full. Embrace thou me!”

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Amalgamated Insurance (Australia),
Ltd. —This co. issued its first balance-sheet
as at June 30. The idea was ingenious;
hut ingenuity isn’t everything. The co. did
not propose to carry on an insurance busi-
ness itself. Instead, it proceeded to estab-
lish subsidiary cos., one in each State.
Actually cos. have been registered in Mel-
bourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, and
called Melbourne Fire Office. Ltd., and so
on. The capital of these pups is provided
by Amalgamated Insurance (Australia),
Ltd.; and their policies are guaranteed by
that co. The person who asks, say, Mel-
bourne Fire Office, Ltd., for information
about its financial position will, of course,
be referred to the guarantee of Amalga-
mated Insurance, Ltd. But the balance-
sheet of that co. is really quite valueless
without reference to the balance-sheet of all
the other cos. For instance, the principal
asset of the Amalgamated Co. is “Shares
held in State Fire Office cos., at cost,
£15,925”; other assets include brokerage,
preliminary exes., underwriting commission
and purchase of business, together £14,100.
These items represent in all over £30,000 of
the co.’s capital of £36,000. Now, in order
to know the value of the guarantee it is
plainly necessary to know what is the real
value of that £15,925 (book value) of
shares. And you can't tell that until you
examine every one of the four subsidiary
balance-sheets.
One subsidiary balance-sheet is available,
that of the Sydney Fire Office. This co. has a
capital of £2OBO, and £1370 is payable in
respect of a purchased business. Itepre.sent-
ing this capital and liability (and it is
not the only liability) the co. had of tan-
gible assets £270 of cash, £22S of book
debts, and a few odds and ends of stationery,
etc. From that one can possibly form some
idea of the present value of the £15,925 of
shares which the guaranteeing co. holds.
As for the other assets, £14.100, as re-
marked before, consists of brokerage and
things that you can’t, see or smell or handle.
The law shouldn’t allow this sort of thing
to go on. The people most interested in
the co. are apparently honest people. Any-
way, they are people with a very good repu-
tation. Most of them are well-known
chemists, members of a Pharmaceutical
Defence Fund, Another is a reputedly
wealthy and very favorably known railway
contractor. They surely cannot realise
what this scheme means. Here they are
guaranteeing the contracts of various cos.
and to show what that guarantee is worth
are putting forward a balance-sheet claim-
ing a certain hook-value for (among others)
shares which they should know have hardly
any assets to support them, they being
shares in a co. which has practically . ex-
hausted all the capital that was subscribed
for it. The whole business is another. illus-
tration of the urgent need for passing a
Federal law regulating insurance cos.

After what happened between seven and
eight years ago a man never feels that he
can be sure of what he is eating when he
feeds on this co.’s accounts. A poor little
4 p.c. had been paid year after year to the
shareholders, who were given no idea that
their goose was busy laying golden eggs.
Then a revaluation was made, and the co.
was declared to he worth half as much again
as previous balance-sheets had said it was;
and up jumped the dividends to 8 p.c., at
which they have stuck ever since. . This
doesn’t give you much confidence in the
published figures.
The co.’s home —at least, the home of its
timber supplies —used to be iMaoiiland, of
course; and it still has kauri forest areas
there. But the reserves are now com-
paratively small, and when the co. s present
areas are cut out there is little hope.of add
in«- any of much consequence. Nor is there
any hope for this generation or the next
from re-planting; for the kauri grows hardly
any faster than a politician’s conscience.
To reach maturity it takes from 600 to
1200 years; and as it is very inflammable
a very bad accident is likely to happen to il
before it reaches years of discretion. llow
long the co. can keep going in. Maonland
this paper has no idea ; but a national stock-
taking in 1009 arrived at the result that the
indigenous forests would “not cope with the
full demand for sawn timber for more than
from 35 to 40 years.” Other estimates make
the robust life of the industry much shorter
than that. . . . •
Its days of prosperity being numbered in
Maori]and, the co. recently crossed over to
Westralia, and the following figures show
some of the results: —

The cut into liquid assets has been pretty
serious ; the money, as explained above, has
gene into new properties, in Maoriland and
Westralia. How it will get on in the latter
State only time can tell. Somehow no co.
has ever had the extraordinary prosperity
over there that bulk-handlers of timber have
had in M.L. and N. S. Wales. But this co.
has the advantage of long experience and an
established business connection. Further,
though the outlook, for the timber trade in
Australia during the next few years is
pretty gloomy, any co. with forest lands
held at a cheap figure must with ordinary
luck make a lot of money in the long run.
There is probably not another article of
general use which is being used up so fast;
and the handier supplies will mount in
value as the world is driven back further
and further for forest timber.

The directors remark that the profit for the
year will no doubt be a pleasant surprise ;
and it is, to some extent. The high prices
ruling not only for wool, but also for farm
and station requisites, have bumped up com-
mission earnings; so, in spite of drought and
war, the income was actually greater than
in tiie preceding year. In view, however, of
the uncertainties of the position, coupled
with the co.’s liabilities of about .£36,000
(represented on the other side by advances
and balances owing), the directors act wisely
in reducing the dividend a trifle, and thus
strengthening the finances. Capital and
reserves are represented by premises and
property (£10,000) and merchandise stock
and bills (£12,109). The paid capital is only
£B5OO. As the reserves greatly exceed that
amount, the rate of dividend is rather decep-
tive. It would be quite a fair thing, and
no doubt also a prudent thing, to pay up
some of the uncalled capital out of undivided
profits or otherwise, and reduce the rate of
dividend.

This co. was formed in the first place to
supply the Sydney suburb of Balmain with
a garbage destructor, in return for which
the local council had besought Parliament
to give it the right to run an electric light
and power business. Parliament obliged,
and at the same time said it might extend
itself if it wanted to. It soon wanted to,
of course, and entered into agreements with
Newtown, Leichhardt, Petersham and Ash-
field councils to supply them -with current
for periods running from 20 years in the
case of Leichhardt to 58 years in the case
of Newtown. The co., not knowing how
rapidly it was going to spread, began with
a modest capital; and it hadn’t got to the
real money-making stage before the demands
for the larger capital came along. This
made financing rather difficult: and the no
doubt wise course of issuing short-dated
debentures was adopted. Subsequently these
were changed to 54 per cents., and a new
lot of 7 per cents, were issued. The present
position is that of share capital there is
now £148,624 paid, and of debentures
50,000 firsts carrying 54 p.c. and £32,400
seconds convertible into shares and carrying
7 p.c.—the latter an excessive price to be
paying even on a second mortgage, consider-
ing (1) the smallness of the first mortgage
and the extent of the share capital, (2)
that there is another £18,976 of share capi-
tal callable, (3) that the whole of the share
and debenture capital is now represented by
tangible assets except for a small amount
of under £lO,OOO. and (4) the magnificent
growth alike of business and profits.
As to this last point the directors give
some data in their last report:—

The profits, shown in the first table, are ex-
clusive of any provision for wear and tear.
The amounts shown as written off are trans-
ferred to a depreciation reserve, upon which
practically no drafts have been thus far
made. It is now £1!).2!)3 in credit, but is
not invested apart from the business. No
doubt money has thus far been too precious
for the directors to put it on deposit with
a bank or anything like that. All the same,
the sooner this replacement fund is repre-
sented by stuff that the directors can buy
new machinery with the better. The future
looks very healthy—so long as the co. is
not bumped by legislation. In spite of its
Parliamentary charter there is always _ a
danger that a co. working a public utility
will be hit from some angle or other —as,
for instance, Queensland gas cos. are
by the new income tax. These chances can-
not of course be reduced to scale or mea-
sured, but they certainly will stand always
in the way of immoderate dividends.

But though the fall in profits is significant,
that table doesn’t tell all the disaster. From
start to finish things have gone wrong. That
is to say, a group of people went in for some-
thing none of them knew anything at all
about, and nothing turned out as they were
told by interested parties that it would.
First, the co. got in almost on the top of
the rubber boom; that is to say, somebody
else who knew more about this business got
out. The co. started on Sept. 15, 1910, and
between then and t he next June 27,0831 b. were
harvested, and what was sold netted 4s. 9d.
The next year’s crop produced over 86,0001 b.;
it cost (including administration) about
Is. Old., and netted 4s. 31d. Next year saw
the slump, and towards the end of 1913
stocks in hand were valued at. only 2s. lOd.
To make matters worse, the yield, which of
course was going to increase, started to
diminish, while costs hurried the other way.
And so things went on, mixed up with a
very expensive law suit which the co. lost,
until last year only 41,2701 b. were tapped,
and the average price realised was a shade
under 2s. 2d.
If that was all the Port Swettenham ven-
ture might very well put crepe round its
hat. But when the co. had probably thought
it had found out all the bad things to be
learned in rubber-growing, a new lesson was
sprung on it. A storm dropped in on the
estate, mowed down many acres, and wiped
out a large percentage of the trees else-
where. For the current year a crop of only
20,0001 b. is estimated at a cost of about 25..
and new trees to replace those destroyed
won’t come in till 1920. So “I strongly
advise the directors to buy another property
as soon as possible, if they can raise the
money,” the visiting agent reports, “and. if
a good offer be made, to sell Port Swetten-
ham.” The directors say they are thinking
about it. Meantime to represent the
£57,500 of capital and £397 of liabilities they
have the devastated property and its trim-
mings and plant and £7374 of liquid assets.

The finances of this thing are improving a
bit. It was a quite mad flotation, and the
early management wasn’t much better.
Now, however, the restaurant has been
leased to the man who made a name for it
before the co. bought it; and, though the
terms of this lease have not been disclosed,
Avherefore nothing can be said as to the
future of the co., the cash position is at any
rate better: —

The capital is now £7OOO in 14.000 10s.
shares. Thus towards that £7OOO there are.
after paying the dividends, £3633 worth of
assets such as furniture, plant and stock
and £6578 of “leases and goodwill” and “im-
provements to premises.” The security for
the principal is therefore poor. And. as
remarked above, the prospects as to revenue
depend very largely upon the nature of the
lease, particulars of which have not been
disclosed. In dealing with an investment
like this, obviously the person with inside
information has such an advantage over the
outsider that the person who can’t he sure
of having inside information all the time
had better pass by on the other side.

There is a doubt about this profit. For the
past year it includes £lO,OOO added to the
formal reserves. These are partly an _ in-
surance fund, which has to carry fairly
heavy risks, since the co.’s fleet of colliers
is not covered by any outside policies. The
true profits are therefore less than £87,268
unless something excessive has been written
off revenue to cover mine depreciation, etc.
The usual explanation is offered for the very
serious fall of the year’s visible profit: “dis-
location of mail and cargo services has led
to decreased demand for bunker coal,” of
which this co. makes a specialty. _ But it
isn’t quite convincing. Figures in 1918
and 1914 weren’t what they had been in
previous years, and it looked in some respects
as if the co. had shot its bolt. The capital-
isation of £150,000 of reserves, and the yarn
that a good many people took advantage of
the increase to get out, more or less sup-
norted the idea that the co. had done as
well as —perhaps better than —it could be
expected to do for a good many years to
come. For one thing, the further it goes
the higher costs are likely to creep, even if
the racketty miners of the South Coast
hadn’t got into the habit of always asking for
a bit more.
But if the co.’s remarkable climb has
stopped (and there were over-sanguine
people who apparently thought it would go
on for ever), one thing seenis pretty cer-
tain : the co. is doing no worse than it says
it is. It always has been a cautiously-
managed concern; and though it has a very
big area it doesn’t bite the coal out without
putting something by to represent the capi-
tal that has thus disappeared. Here is a

In five years the co.’s surplus of liquid assets
has thus increased by just on £50,000, £5OOO
has been added to stores, and many thou-
sands' (this paper doesn’t know how many)
have been put into plant and steamers.
Meantime the dividend has been paid. That
is a record which should give the share-
holders a more comfortable feeling after llie
shock of getting only 5 p.c. (nominally) for
the year. And the fact that in 10 years
over £150,000 of net liquid assets have been
accumulated is not likely to make that com-
fortable feeling any the less comfortable.

The shareholder wants to know, first, what
a. society of this sort is likely to lose through
this war crisis. He vaguely remembers
what Melbourne building societies lost after
the last big boom broke. This co., for in-
-stance, rattles the bones of no less than
half a dozen societies which flourished or
seemed to flourish in the boom of the
’eighties. What made them go bung? The
same thing in every case, so far as this
paper knows : they lent too much on securi-
ties and the values receded faster than the
instalments came in. If a society lends
£5OO on security worth that much and the
borrower pays off £75 a year, it doesn’t
matter much if the value does fall during
the year to £425 —the society is still covered.
But if the value falls to *£375, then the bor-
rower can make £5O by throwing up his
security and buying an equal property for
£375. Trouble struck these societies because
the tide went out so fast. Though our
present national troubles are very great, the
tide isn’t running out fast. In fact, thus
far the war has scarcely affected most Aus-
tralian values at all. y
To us the war hasn’t been the expected
awful drain: it has rather been an occasion
for spending a very large amount of bor-
rowed money ; and that always means boom
conditions. The drain will start presently.
We still don’t know how much we shall feel
it: that depends on the sort of seasons w r e
have and the energy with which we push
production. Meantime, even assuming that
we shall feel the drain pretty badly, when
the spending stops and the repaying begins,
the purchaser on time-payment is reducing
his liability and thus putting the society in
a safe place. A greater danger might
arise from new transactions. There were
people who thought that all values would go
to pieces and all business would go to pot
as soon as the war started. Because nothing
of the sort happened they think they are done
with the war. In this case the management
doesn’t appear to have suffered from any
such delusions; wherefore it hasn’t been
making advances furiously. On the con-
trary, it has been plainly playing for
safety :

The Junction, one of the freak mines of
Broken Mill, is now owned by a mostly
Sydney co., which has tried the plan of sell-
ing a parcel of ore to the Sulphide Corpora-
tion at a flat rate of 20s. per ton, the two
cos. then equally dividing proceeds after the
Corporation has cut out Os. for milling. The
co. gets nothing for the zinc contents,
though ; and it wants something if any future
contracts are signed. As final settlement is
not made till three months after delivery,
and as delivery had not been completed on
Sept. 30, the directors can only guess that
they will get another 10s. or 12s. Gd. per
ton. How it will all pan out is not yet
known, but the management is probably right
in believing that it is a better plan than
attempting ore treatment on the mine. That
would mean much new plant, and (1) the
co. hasn’t got the money, (2) the mine hasn’t
the proved reserves to justify the outlay.
The mine is already mortgaged to the John
Darling estate for £13,511. Various cos.
have struggled with this property. One or
two have had a very fat time while it lasted ;
but in this area the Broken Hill lode takes
a sudden twist, and ore deposits are very
irregular in quantity and quality.
* -x- *
The management of the White Crystal,
Ardlethan (N.S.W.), was changed recently,
but the staggering reports continue on the
old pattern. “Payable” and “profitable” ore
is everywhere. But Crosby’s Hill open cut
gets no limelight these days ; probably there
is too much mullock in it for even the
Crystal to term “payable.” The stuff from
Stackpool’s shaft must be very deceptive.
Any outsider would swear that this carries
at most a trace of tin. The Windlass shaft
was only restarted lately after about two
years’ idleness. It had a “payable” lode,
too, 3ft. wide at a depth, of 50ft. And yet
it was neglected. ‘ It would be'highly inter-
esting to know (1) what the Crystal people
consider a “payable” grade, (2) why the
battery so often stops, and when going why
it runs to the breakneck pace of 114 revolu-
tions per minute, (3) what recovery it
makes, and (4) what is to happen when
the “high-grade crushing material” at No. 1
level gives out.
* * * *
The Wild Cherry, Ardlethan, is eking out
a mostly-miserable existence on some sur-
facing (the “battery face worked by open
cut” of the reports), retreatment of tails.
' and a very little underground ore. The end
is liable to come at any time. Of the battery
all one need to say is that it suits the mine.
The whole combination is enough to make
the holders of the 130,000 shares very
dismal.
* * * -X-
A fine row is proceeding over the Board
of the Carpathia, Ardlethan, which was re-
cently cordially invited by the shareholders
to get out —and at last got. The struggle
now appears to be to put somebody in who,
for some obscure reason, will engineer the
purchase of the White Crystal.

Bodangora Co., which is working the
Dick’s II eward section of the Mitchell’s
Creek mine (N.S.W.), reports a crushing
of 984 tons for £3700. This includes the
value, of the concentrates. As this result is
practically from ore won in opening
up new levels it must be considered satis-
factory. The experience of this mine is
the reverse of the rule in N.S.W., inasmuch
as the lode has been improving in quantity
and quality as it has been sunk on. The
whole of the old Mitchell’s Creek is now
owned by the Bodangora Co. —a Melbourne
Dyason-Sutherland flotation. The crowd is
evidently pleased with the prospects, as
shares are marketable at an advance on the
amount called up on them.

“F.H.R.”: When one sees the regular
divs. paid at Charters Towers by Papuan
Brilliant and Clarks from a small rich reef,
it is surprising how stubbornly the southern
investor passes similar bodies by. We have
Sin. of clean stone worth, by practical tests,
£l5 per ton. The country is good, and water
at 30ft. beaten by a windlass. Still, not a
mining man in Australia would inspect with
a view to purchase. They all say: “If you
have anything about 3ft. of lower values,
we’ll look at it at once.” Now, Sin. of £l5
stone is in every way a better investment
than 3ft. of loz. stone. There is less haul-
ing, only one-fifth the carting and crushing
for the same amount of gold, and in soft
ground filling is done away with. Is it
stone they are after or gold? And the differ-
ence in the cost of plant would sink a shaft.

Really it isn’t decent of the Melbourne-
owned Adelong Estates (N.S.W.), after
struggling along with two big dredges unable
to put up more than a 2300 z. record for a
week, to permit No. 1* plant to start off
with 1720 z., to follow it up with 19840 z., and
then eclipse everything with 2350 z. Seeing
that it takes 70oz. to cover the costs of the
two plants when at work, and seeing that
No. 1 has only blazed out like this after the
boiler of No. 1 had collapsed, wouldn’t it
pay the co. to keep one plant permanently out
of commission V Folk with itching palms
want a Christmas box; and there is no rea-
son why profits should be bottled up,
unless the Board lias a lixed policy as to the
dates on which divs. should be forthcoming.
Meanwhile the older Adelong Creek toddles
on with nice average returns that are shov-
ing it fast on to the path that leads to divs.

Mining-engineer Dyason, who is fighting
for the mining cos. against union-secretary
Little’s proposed mine-wage log in front of
Justice Power, doesn’t give much for the
Victorian industry nowadays. His valua-
tion of all the cos. in the Cabbage Garden is
£200,000. Little retorted that Al, New Langi,
Catlicart Central and one or two other
mines ran up to half a million. Dyason
wasn’t caught napping by the raising of his
bluff that way. He made the retort that if
the scrip were bundled on to the market they
wouldn’t even fetch the £200,000. That’s
quite true. But it’s also true that if one of
the score of mining “it's” doddering on in
alluvial or quartz at Ballarat or Bendigo got
on to gold, the market would soon find its
backbone. What Justice Power has to do
isn’t to fog over the market, but just to
make up his mind what is a fair wage and
(quite as important) what is the best system
to get decent efficiency for such a fair wage.

George Dickenson winds up 1915 with a
4s. div. out of the Al, Gaffney’s, and a
dazzling float of the Morning Star, Woods
Point (Vic.). The deal doesn’t sparkle
because of the size of the co. —00,000 shares
of 5s. —or because the vendors mop up
lt>,ooo paids, or even because Dickenson him-
self gets allotted 10,000 paids for subscrib-
ing to 30,000 shares, but because he has
induced the Mines Dept, to give him £lO.OOO,
pound for pound, for plant and equip-
ment purposes. Of course, the Woods Point
auriferous dyke ought to be opened up. Yet
after reading the prospectus reports and
seeing the following that Dickenson has over
the Al success, there never was a doubt
that the gentle public would have put up
all the coiu he wanted to give his big Woods
Point bulge a proper test, grant or no grant.
However, it is not too late for the State to
look up what the Natal Government did
over the Premier diamond mine. If the
Government gives cash, why shouldn’t it
participate in profits permanently? Dick
Seddon did that with the Bank of New Zea-
land when it got on to the rocks, and what’s
sauce for the commercial goose is sauce for
the mining gander. Private Enterprise
wouldn’t hand over cash to a hard-up mine
unless it was to stand in. Bank-director
Money Miller will explain that to Dickenson
when he starts kic king over this suggestion.

A death-bed sort of half-yearly report was
presented to Golden Ridge shareholders in
Kalgoorlie the other day. Receipts were
£1221 in excess of working expenditure, but
with depreciation, development, outlay on
options and other deductions this credit was
converted into a debit of £492. Cash assets
toral £10,105. The chairman announced that
the end was near and it was improbable
that operations could be continued much
longer. Several parties of tributors who
had been working in places that would not
pay the co. to bother about had done fairly
well, but others had not. He added that, as
the Melbourne and Adelaide Exchanges had
ceased to call the co.’s shares, and in view
of the necessity to curtail exes., it had been
decided to close the Adelaide office. At
present a small rich vein is being worked
above No. 2 level, and on the continuance
and widening of this rests the last hope of
the co.

Westralian shareholders in Edna May are
up against the suggested amalgamation with
the Deeps, and are busy framing a joint
protest for despatch to the Melbourne Board.
Some even still doubt the reported value of
Deeps’ borehole development, and are
convinced that the co. would not be so suc-
cessful with a second try. One large holder
of Edna Mays is prepared to pay the cost
of a second hole on the following conditions :
Drilling to commence from same point as
the first one and extend for 243 ft. in any
direction or at any angle that the Deeps’
Board nominates; drilling to be under the
supervision of an independent expert.

Claude De Bernales has passed on Chaf-
fers (W.A.) to the Lake View and Star,
through its agent, Sid l r eo. at a small profit.
The new owners’ general manager, Vail,
roughly estimated the ore in sight at 93,162
valued at 295. per ton. The profit
on this if raised and flying-foxed or trammed
to the Lake View mill should if the tonnage
and grade are right pay .for the purchase
consideration several times over.

Associated Northern (W.A.) is nibbling
at the Slippery Gimlet, whose workings are
not far from its sick Victorious mine at Ora
Banda. About three years ago the State
Mining Engineer reported on the Gimlet in
favorable terms and estimated that there
was £64,000 in sight. They then wanted
£25,000 for the show, but are now prepared
to take a good deal less.

From an old battler in those remote parts:
Bewick, Moreing - and C'o. took ovei' options on
the leases at Wairiedar, near Field’s Find (W.A.),
on January 31 of this year, and since that time have
done a lot of work in erecting machinery and boring-
and sinking for water. Want of water has caused
no end of anxiety, but they now have what they
reckon an ample supply located, and anticipate profit-
able returns in about two months’ time, when they
will have the pipe line and pumping plant installed.
It is computed that on the Mug’s Luck and Aurum
leases there are about 60,000 tons of £3 ore more
or less developed, and a shaft (down 180 ft.) is
70ft. in sulphides. They must have spent about
£6OOO to date, and that is hopeful. A 10-head
mill has been completed, grinding pans, self-feeders,
ore bins and hauling gear installed, and a cyanide
plant and slimes plant arc in course of erection.
Several outside shows have sprung up, and give
fair promise. New roads have been made from
Yalgoo, and the field now has a mail service once
a week and a motor-car service twice a week, both
run by Cobb and Co. It is about 67 miles by the
new road from Yalgoo.

The rise in copper has done wonders for
the State-subsidised smelter at Phillips
River (W.A.). The first shipment of
matte realised £20,000, and two later ship-
ments have returned £50,500, or £70,500 in
all. A second run is now in progress and
is turning out equally well. To date the
Government lias laid out £51,000, including
£19,500 advances on ore. Before the State
and the war came to the assistance of local
leaseholders, ore assaying less than 10 p.c.
would not pay for mining and treatment.
Now profits are being made out of much
poorer stuff.

Augusta (W.A.) has ended its misspent
life. The linish had to come sooner or later,
and it would have come much sooner had

certain for any sane co. to tackle.

Adelaide Enterprise (W.A.), with 8700
shares on its register, has lately earned a
little money from the treatment of a shal-
low deposit of 20s. ore, and now needs to
hold on to some of it. In the last few
months the Board has distributed two Is.
dividends, and has left so little iu the bank
that if the co. suddenly bumped against a
snag in the shape of a decrease in grade or
a rise in costs, both of which are likely, it
would find itself in a bad way, and would
probably have to sacrifice decent prospects.

Round Hill, 80 miles south from Devon-
port (Tas.), is being made ship-shape by
John Craze, ex-manager of British Mon-
tana, Zeelnm. Old cavities ahd stopes are
being mullocked up, old passes pulled out,
and new timbering installed in the main
drives preparatory to ore winning. A new
mill is being erected, and tramways and ore
bins are being built. The mine looks to have
900 ft. of backs, 400 ft. long and of a varying
width of from sft. to 60ft. of galena ore,
with rich patches.

The South Aus. Oil Wells Co.’s report
affirms that Dr. Wade’s tw'o chief arguments
for denying the existence of petroleum iu
S.A. have been disproved by the drill. The
manager says : —-
The two main points in Dr. Wade’s condemnation
were the absence of folding- and the fact that the
“surface cover” is but a thin sheet over an older
landscape. Hence he said the sedimentary beds
could not be deep enough to contain oil. As regards
the first point we know now that the shales are
folded at a steep angle, which fact argues the pre-
sence of anticlines and synclines. As to his second
point, we have already penetrated 1575 ft. of the
“thin sheet,” and are beginning to think that, after
all, it may be a thick one. No signs of the “older
landscape” are as yet visible. The two foundations
of Dr. Wade’s report having thus been upset we
can afford to disregard the conclusions there ex-
pressed.

Except for a cleaning gang most Rand
mines are now worked day shift only. Some
are still stopped—by want of compressed
air in most cases—from following suit, hut
the entire abolition, of night labor on the
field is coming. The annual 10 days’ holi-
day on half-pay to all underground men,
agreed to after the 1913 strike, is proving
a blessing to those concerned, and much
smaller boons have had far more importance
attached to them in Australia.

“F.1.J.”: The Tasmanian State Govern-
ment has received an offer from the Com-
monwealth Defence Department to buy
5000 tons of shale oil per annum at between
£3 and £4 a ton. The Defence Minister
says he will need 10,000 tons yearly. Con-
sidering there are contracts running now for
the supply of Yankee oil to the Australian
Navy at 90s. and 955. a ton, Jen-
sen is not doing his very best to encourage
the development of the manufacture of oil
from shale at Latrobe (Tas.). If the local
navy wants fuel oil, why give 15s. a ton less
for it to local people than to aliens in the
U.S.A.? The fact is the navy must have a
certain supply of oil within Australia inde-
pendent of outside supplies, and if it costs
£6 a ton to distil oil at Latrobe it must be
done by the Government from sheer neces-
sity.
Antimony has had a phenomenal rise, be-
cause it is used in making shrapnel. “Star”
antimony is up to -£<SO, and common sul-
phides are !)s. .'ld. per unit of 50 p.c. ore,
which pans out £24 odd. Years ago anti-
mony smelting works were established in
North Queensland, but foreign competition
soon put an end to that foolishness. The
high price has given things a start again
at Ilillgrove (N.S.AV.); in nine weeks 150
tons of ore were smelted there for 50 tons
of regulus.

INDIGESTION, DYSPEPSIA,
GASTRITIS,
THEN ULCERATION.
WHY MAGNESIA SHOULD BE TAKEN
AFTER EVERY MEAL.
A flushed face may be the first noticeable
symptom of indigestion, but disregard this
warning and soon there is unmistakable pain,
for indigestion is a progressive ailment. At
first the symptoms may be allayed by pepsin,
bismuth or soda, but these things do not
overcome the acid in the stomach, which is
usually the underlying cause of the trouble,
and consequently the acid accumulates and
the occasional attack of indigestion becomes
chronic dyspepsia. The dyspeptic is always
particularly liable to gastritis, and gastric
ulcers in the stomach are only too often the
forerunners of peritonitis and death. That
is why physicians lay such stress upon the
importance of keeping the stomach free from
harmful acid, and are continuously advising
chronic dyspeptics as well as those who only
experience occasional attacks of indigestion,
to keep a little pure bisurated magnesia
handy, and take half a teaspoonful in a
little water after every meal. Local chemists
stock bisurated magnesia; in fact, _ they
have lately been making quite a speciality
of it, and we would certainly advise readers
having any form of digestive or stomach
trouble to* obtain a supply, and give it a
trial. Remember, though, that it is bisu-
rctcd magnesia which physicians recom-
mend : the oxides, citrates and sulphates of
magnesia, or crude mixtures of bismuth and
magnesia, would probably do more harm
than got d.— AdvT.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, December 13, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
The new destroyer Swan took her morn-
ing bath sharp on half-past 11 on Saturday.
One ferry-boat, with a fringe of launches,
carried the visitors to the sun-tanned yards
at Cockatoo. The tough old tar, Rear-
Admiral Creswell, was handy when Mrs.
Admiral flung the wine at the Swan’s grey
beak. Wrapped in the Union Jack it failed
to break; whereat some tactful person re-
marked that it was hard to smash anything
with that bit of bunting round it. The Cres-
well dame put more muscle into the next
attack, and it was all right then. But in
the excitement of the moment the streamers
that held the bouquet were forgotten, and
floated off with the launched craft. A
carved box held the tool the Admiral’s lady
hammered into the bit of stage mechanism
that freed the water-bird. This is to go
with the Creswell heirlooms.
Even the small Swan-party had to be
harassed _ with the etiquette of seidlitz-
powder tickets. Thus, women press repre-
sentatives, with white cards of admission,
were of course rejected of the pink stand and
not eligible for the blue stand, while they
just missed having the only pattern of white
placard that gave the freedom of the official
eyrie. . An intelligent policeman waved an
arm towards the perpendicular ladder the
male photographers—who prefer to be skied
—climbed like cats. Another luminous intel-
lect under a blue helmet pointed blandly to
an almost equally inaccessible loft farther
along. Thanks to a naval frill, who “took
the responsibility,” the invited presswomen
were allowed to go_ up the easy stairs that
were trodden by the* political hoof.
“Speech, speech !” came from the dockyard
boys when Prime Minister Hughes loomed
against the skyline. But “Billy,” who looks
as if he had been working long hours, was
coy, and subsided into his hat behind the
spruce figure of Navy Minister Jensen.
Burly Senator Gardiner, who used to be
“Jupp” and a popular footballer, tossed a
vote of thanks to the lady who presided at
the font. General Finn and his slender
missus, Attorney-General Dave Hall and his
larger half under the brim of a shady hat,
manager King Salter, and a stray consul or
two hung over the rail to see the Swan shake
the spray off her sides. Little Mrs. Shimizu,
all smiles, flashed a pair of sparkling eyes
behind a white lace veil in the official pen.
The report that Captain Leslie Wilson is
a prisoner of war in Germany is followed by
a hum of regrets here. He was adored by
our Best Suburbs when he stalked behind
bluff old Governor Rawson, and heartily liked
by the Australian man as a good sport. His
own branch of the service was the Marines ;
but after his marriage with one of the
affluent Goderich Smith girls, he went on to
the reserve list, and entered English politics.
As a result of his Australasian experience,
his maiden House of Commons speech was
on “Defence of the Empire” ; but there was
too much ginger in it to please the placid,
well-fed gentlemen who were giving Britan-
nia a daily dose of chloroform. This was
months before the war. They know better
now.
Leslie Wilson, by the way, was men-
tioned in despatches, and won the D.S.O.
as a lieutenant during the S’Afriean war.
The fight for next use of the Sydney
mayoral rabbit skin settled down to a duel
between Hagon and Meagher—the one
Spencer Brunron’s nominee and the other
Thomas Barlow’s. The first round was a
draw—l 3 votes each; and so the matter
stands, with at least a dozen hungry eyes
on the seat and the £lOOO which is waiting
to be spent in the next 12 months. Even
Mayor Richards, though he has lost his place
in the Council, has been wondering whether
there isn’t a way to creep back for a third
helping. The Mayoress’s Sewing Guild will
drop the covers on its treadle machines on
December 21 and take a holiday, and there is
much wrinkling of foreheads as to who will
be Chieftainess when the stitches are picked
up again.
Osmer B. Ward, of the Block 10 mine at
Broken Hill, with Mrs. Osmer 8., passed
through last week on their way back home
from a twelvemonth spent on one of Papua’s
islands, where a gold proposition looks good.
Some weeks back Mr. Ward had the bad
luck to fall down a shaft and injure a limb.
There was nothing in the surgeon line within
a couple of days’ steam, so first-aid had to
do its best till the patient could be shipped
south for repairs.
Admiralty House is still a kind of inter-
mediate base for official wanderers. Just
new the roomy old house at Elizabeth Bay
which is occupied by successive naval mag-
nates from Garden Island, is getting a hearty
slap of fresh paint. So Captain (now
Commodore) Henderson and his sister are
occupying the Kirribilli cabin.
Frank Clarke, once of the Federal House,
came back home by the Changsha last trip
from the centre of the Northern Territory
to have his health overhauled. Two of his
boys are tailored in khaki; one of them is
already in the thick of things with the
Light Horse, and the other is getting his
range with the Field Artillery.
At last the Government has smiled upon
the feminist party’s efforts to lead the sex to
civil-service desks. But the usual blow fell
when the extent of the Public Service
Board’s approval was stated. Women are
still, it seems, “an experiment.” Hence the
bland notice that they will be paid less than
male clerks of the same status. Women’s
clubs are threatening to do something tre-
mendous in oratory to meet this crisis.
“Tith’s” farewell benefit lacked both the
presence of the old actor—serious illness
being the bar —and the enthusiasm of a big
house. Nevertheless, when Walter Bentley
read the touching goodbye of the sick man,
the audience showed its feelings in an ova-
tion. Still more heartily did the gallery
bang the floor to express its pleasure at the
hint of financial splendor in the Caledonian’s
oration. The audience was told that, owing
to the number of subscriptions, the cash
surplus couldn’t be judged by the attend-
ance.
The programme had some good undercuts
from many theatrical sirlions. “Nobody’s
Widow” gave us a taste of Muriel Starr so
careless in enunciation these days that
“Speak up!” came clamant from the gods.
Grace Palotta, in dreamy blue, wore her hair
so close to her head in this scene that she
gave us the hard-boiled-egg coiffure of the
moment. Vera Pearce, a strapping Venus,
had an accompaniment of smaller Venuses,
very lightly clad in a little insertion and
pink silk. Thelma Raye, also from the
Tivoli; an act of “The Old Guard”; a dance,
with Pintel at the piano and two eccentric
skyrockets on the floor —these were the chief
ingredients of the fare.
The “Joan of Arc” matinde, which pro-
duced Mrs. Boult’s drama, drew a satisfac-
tory audience. A number of convalescent
soldiers present got immense joy out of
the clashes of arms. The rattle of old-
fashioned ironmongery—notably the inverted
soup-tureen-armor in which Harry Thomas
(otherwise Armand) fought for the Maid of
Orleans —was vociferously applauded. When
one combatant, mortally wounded, carefully
laid himself out to die comfortably on his
stomach, subdued assistance came from re-
turned Gallipoli boys. “Turn him over,
Miss!” they counselled. “He’ll never last
the night that way!” Queenie Boult was
much above the average amateur standard in
the long part of Joan. Netta Lawson was
another satisfactory amateur in a cast that
may be stated (with exaggeration) to be a
quarter of a mile long. The dresses anc
stage management were good. And so was
the cricket. When the pseudo King tried
to trick the Maid by jumping into King
Charles’s royal millinery, he dropped his
crown but caught it like a ball and hur-
riedly banged it on again. Toys and sweets
as Christmas gifts for the orphans of fallen
soldiers are the result of Mrs. Boult’s effort.
Australia Day Amelioration Committee is
working in the sweat of its brow these warm
days. But it is lucky to have a cave-like
fastness in the old Education Building,
Loftus-street. Here Miss Evans, of Mos-
man’s Voluntary Aid Detachment, pours
out tea for returned soldiers. This room
is not a lounge for the hearty man on leave
from Liverpool. It is solely for convalescents
who call to see the committee. The dona-
tions of cakes and other light luxuries are
not coming in quite freely enough to meet
the needs of over a hundred visitors a day.
For goodness sake don’t send biscuits—
they’re dead-tired of biscuits in Gallipoli!
Hospitality is offered free, so the ladies
behind the counter ask for more buns
to eat and more easy-cushion chairs for war-
battered men to rest in.
This year the Wynne Art prize goes to a
sculptor. The successful J. C. Wright is a
serious young Scot with a brilliant student’s
career behind him. He collected various
scholarships and medals in Scotland and
England before starting for Australia in
1912. Now he butters his crust —sculpture
being a side-line while the guns boom—as
art lecturer at Blackfriars Training College.
Surgeon-Colonel Stokes is now P.M.O. in
this Military District—“provisionally for
six months.” In plain English, he
has to show what kind ot a I .M.U.
ho makes before he settles down to a
billet that needs a first-rate organiser.
Another Dr. Stokes —from Taree- has a
much less pleasant job. He is chief medical
officer at a populous segregation camp winch
occupies an island in the Hawkesbury. lint
we never mention that.
The Movie Gazette showed last week the
welding of two hearts at a village church
somewhere in England. The parties to the
wedding were Joan Innes-Noad of this spot
and Corporal Eastman. The bride s
getting-away garb stuck out all round in the
mode of to-morrow, and didn’t come within
a foot-rule of Mother Earth. The groom s
travelling clothes were the ones he wears all
the time now.
“Mr. James,” head of the house of Fair-
fax, and senior partner in the S. M. Herald
firm for half a century or so —his father
“admitted” him 60 years ago was
surprised the other day to find that lie
begins to get an old man. He has kept his
nose hard to the grindstone till now; but
the doctors tell him that he can’t do it any
more.
Newtown, where you can now hardly drop
a hint between the shops and houses, had
till last week a resident who was there early
enough to gather kindling wood from the
present site of the Town Hall. Mrs. Dolan
she was. Her husband was once stuck up
by Frank Gardiner, the bushranger with a
mysterious family pull. But Dolan was a
hard-up subject, so Gardiner gave him £1
to help him on the road. Some other body’s
pound, of course. That was the occasion
Frank struck an heroic pose and declared he
never robbed the poor. No doubt the hum-
bug had discovered that it wasn’t worth
while.
Mrs. Carson, of Elystan, Woollahra, will
be out of town till the end of January.
But the 2nd Battalion depot, at 39 Pitt-
street, will still open its maw for parcels,
barring Christmas week.
Depots for soldiers’ comforts are not
standing any nonsense from careless
packers. A sharp notice that some-
one who left a parcel for so-and-so
will “oblige by calling at once to
repack same,” has a smack of the regimental
sergeant about it. Ladies whose lumpy
knitting has to be unpicked in order to save
the wool are likely to get even shorter
shrift.
Hugh Ward came home the other day.
Amongst the theatrical props he brought is
the old Gaiety favorite, Connie Ediss, and
her mountain of baggage.
The J.° B. Christian family, or what is left
of it, go to Leura for the summer. They’ll
put Tudor, their water-side nest at Eliza-
beth Bay, into camphor in consequence.
Two daughters, Mrs. Sid Christian and a
sister, are in Egypt. A third. Mrs. Ted
Antill, is due for a holiday after a year’s
work at the War Chest depot. The fourth
sister, Mrs. Harry Morris, has her own cot
on a Leura hillside.
Mrs. Charles Regan, lately widowed, is
putting in the summer at Cronulla. That
sandpatch shows no signs of a slump this
season, and trippers are spreading their
canvas as in peace time.
What innocent and unsuspecting things
wo women are ! A fluffy, chattering contin-
gent went out to a military camp one night
to celebrate with food and music the open-
ing of a regimental mess-tent. Some days
previous to the visit their warrior hosts
(Ihe Fourteenth Centaurs) had quelled
some trouble amongst the Greenland Halber-
diers, and the Halberdiers were looking for
revenge. On the night of the fluffy concert
the Halberdiers had gathered secretly with
venomous intent on the hills overlooking the
Centaurs’ lines; but the alert Centaurs,
aware of the fact, had taken all sorts of
precautions, including pickets and search-
lights on carts. In addition every Centaur
carried a waddy to the concert and held
himself ready to jump. But the precau-
tions were too complete, and the only noises
of the night were the melodious ones sup-
plied by the performers, not one of whom
suspected that a hostile army 2000 strong
was ready to rush on them at any moment.
What a desirable thing well-timed ignorance
is!
That broth of a boy, the Rev. O’Reilly,
now rector of St. John’s, has, of course,
been shaking things up since he took hold.
He has been inquiring into the merits of
vacuum cleaners and other household trea-
sures, besides getting fresh amusements for
the young gentlemen in the front parlors.
A new library, a piano, and the bang of
brooms all mark the opening months of the
reign of O’Reilly.
A Chatswood girl, Pansy Simpson, is to
wed E. James Davidson on the 22nd in the
local church. P.ansy’s elder sister, Amy,
was a popular ballad singer here years ago.
Then she went to London for polish and
remained for pay.
Allies’ Day had a postscript in a launch
party, at which Mrs. George Black was
hostess. The picnickers, who included
Allies’ stall dames, retaliated with spirit,
and handed the Chief Secretary’s missus a
gold wristlet timekeeper, which flashed a
diamond circlet.
A Queensland man, Norman Christensen,
of Colinton, has put the usual question to a
Slosman girl Miss Nankervis. O*W«J
pere has interests m Brisbane and Den
maik.
Premier Holman’s wife comes home in
ample time to order the Christinas dinner,
She has been bustling through “the States
with Mrs. Hugh Mclntosh. I understand
both ladies have been feasted by Personages,
and they bring back the usual “impressions,
Enthusiasts who barrack for the children
0 f mean streets found their way to the
backwoods of Wentworth Park the other
afternoon. Attorney-General Hall knew
more about it than other pilgrims. In
opening the new and handsome bungalow
built on a small grassless patch of this
dreary-looking city lung, the lean legal limb
described his infantine gambols there. “In
those days it had an open sewer running-
through it,” said Davie, who lives and pros-
pers to tell the tale of this unpromising start
in life. John Mackay and Mrs. Francis
Anderson chortled with glee at the happy
consummation of a long struggle for official
sanction to build on a public park. lhe
circumstances are exceptional, else the citi-
zen might well bring his quills to attention,
The Qafe Chantant at Wentworth Hotel

rain dripped occasionally on the outdoor
show, then pulled off after stirring those
present to rush for gamps. The Albert
Gould dame was president of the committee,
Indoors Society played bridge or poker with
a glow of virtue—for wasn’t it in Patriot-
ism’s cause? In the hotel garden swinging
shaded lights, with a fierce white blaze here

included singer Gladys Hay, just back from
rusticating in New England, W. J. Coad,
Grace Stafford, and the very-popular Wool-
wich Pierrots. Later on Clarence Bridge’s
large and genial countenance rose behind an
auctioning of odds and ends,

is a Grace—a niece of the cricketer who died
the other day. She warbles in the Garden

Pretty Lizette Parkes recently lost her
father, who was Aaron, for long years eon-
nected with local orchestras. The girl can
claim to have owned as parent one of the
least aggressive musicians m the State. His
way was so devoid of incident that his
only big advertisement was his funeral. The
fraternity laid the quiet old musician to rest
to the strains of Chopin s I uneral March,

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, December 18, 1015.
My Dear Yabrie, —
The Rutter Clarkes’ Merriwa fete cleared
£lOOO between two o’clock and midnight, and
Rutter said he was glad; but I hear he sat
in the fowlhouse and groaned when fat
suburbanites dug their careless heels into
his flowerbeds. The first stall-holder to
arrive was Mrs. Henty, with material for
her stationery shop. The old cab-horse carry-
ing the load got suddenly frisky and tipped
stationery and Mrs. Henty into the creek-
gutter outside the gates. Then the giddy old
nag rolled on his back amongst pink blotting-
paper and scented envelopes. The lady was
not hurt, merely annoyed.
Mrs. Tallis worked brilliantly with her
retinue of theatricals. They sang and
gagged from a balcony, and the jolly, fat
suburban neighbors came and stared up at
them as if they were more than human.
Ethel Dane, under an ice-cream hat and
some frills, ran a Kaiser Aunt Sally, which
had to be repaired several times. The best
of the fun was in the evening. Mrs. George
Chirnside revelled beautifully in cinnamon
color, with a hat full of ospreys. She ap-
pointed herself chief assistant to organiser
Tommy Cochrane, and supplied a carload of
fixings and props from her Werribee home.
Tommy’s auctioneer’s rostrum had a Per-
sian rug on it, and after selling everything
from a bottle of tomato sauce to a block of
land, he nearly auctioned the rug with Mrs.
George clinging to it. It was a narrow
escape. An Early Georgian bowl (bought
in Bourke-street for Sd.) sold for guineas.
People quickly caught the infection and bid
for anything.
Roma Clarke (who “lights up” well)
wore an ostrich farm on her head, peered at
her buying-victims through a lorgnette, and
added the American-touch to her gown by a
“low-neck” below her hat. Mrs. Derby-
shire played accompaniments till she became
limp from exhaustion. Mrs. Sanderson —
in black —looked and sang well. Lady Helen
called in for a brief half-hour and was
nearly smothered in the crush. She bought
an iris like a white butterfly from Rutter
Clarke himself for a big sum.
Toorak’s first line loyally motored to the
show; and the plain hedge suburbanites
shoved and trampled them in the
friendliest way. The Baillieux were
there in force—all except Clive and
his wife, who were welcoming a new 7 baby.
Harry Hill, as modest and hard-working
an amateur actor as ever strutted, did suit-
able things, and Florence Vie sold strips
of blue concert tickets. Walter Butler and
a dozen Frenchwomen ran the French vil-
lage fete down in the gully. Boffard made
a gorgeous and excited mayor. The
commander and a number of cadets
from the Belgian training ship wandered
about. One of them brought along a
Uhlan’s helmet, which was duly auctioned.
Rich squattress Eva Robertson turned out
her sovereign-purse for a gold-tipped
vanity-box presented by Mrs. Tallis. The
Rutter Clarke children sold strawberries on
the drying lawn, and occasionally adver-
tised their own wares by eating them.
Gregan McMahon stage-managed an
effective old English reading within the
clipped yew hedges of the sunken lawn, with
flaring torches here and there. They called
it “The Masque of Gloriana.” Miss Kiddle
took the name-part.
» The Oriental Hotel cafe chantant in aid
of the Lady Stanley appeal was crowded
to suffocation —with women. There were
men present, but one needed a lantern and
a search warrant to discover them. The
cinsh of heavy, barebacked matrons round
the gambling tables was terrible; they
staked their threepenny bits with tragic
expressions when men would have trifled
easily with half-crowns and more and made
their wives pay for it afterwards. People
crouched round small tables and were fed
with ices by honorary waitresses. The girls
had to dodge aside when the musical items
came on. One large, fair girl with her
plump back well exposed couldn’t be
bothered, and just knelt through each
number.
The question of naming the little stranger
who arrived at State Government House six
weeks ago is engaging the attention of the
Stanleys. Three Christian names have
already been decided on, but the infant’s
parents are resolved that it shall have at
least four. According to the very latest
communiques it is to be Lyulph Henry Owen
Stanley. The first is after its paternal
grandfather. Lord Sheffield; the second in
honor of its maternal grand-dad, Henry
Evans Gordon; and the third is an old
name in the Stanley family. The important
young person’s fourth name is to form a
sentimental link with the country of its
birth, and the family is at present torn
between Victor and Melbourne. When it
comes to the christening Mrs. Henley, the
Honorable sister of her Ex., will act as
godmother,
On Friday the massed Melbourne artists
will show the plain gardening citizen what
gay Parisian dogs they are—-in public. There
will bo a pageant, "War and Peace,”
and the populace will stand on the side-
walks and gape at the Latin Quarter-ings
made of cardboard and kerosene-tins and
paint and cleverness. The original trading-
label was “Artists’ Day” ; but Gaud Mayor
Hennessy came in, and it was changed to
“Remembrance Day.” There will be stalls and
she-bushrangers everywhere, and cartoon-
ist Low will make sketch-portraits in public
and see them sold by auction, and other well-
known artists will do silhouettes.
Pretty little “Possum” Clarke, whose
marriage in London “Rosna” told you all
about a few weeks ago, is so like her mother
(now Lady Grey-Egerton) that mamma’s
old beaux couldn’t take their eyes off her
when she visited us two or three years ago.
Rupert gave his girl away—and if he per-
formed as generously as he did when daugh-
ter Phyll was wedded at Rupertswood. the
bride must have been a vision of delight.
Phyll got the usual house, furniture, slieep-
statiom etc.; but her discerning dad added
heaps of trousseau treasures and ivory and
silver-toilet trifles that only a clever caterer
for feminine luxury could have thought of.
Any old father can go and buy the expen-
sive obvious things; it takes a sort of
paternal genius to select the delicious vani-
ties a petted woman loves to have about her.
One defect in the Rest Home scheme is
the snobbery of some of the honorary girl-
lielpers. The silly little things seem unable
to rid themselves of the idea that they are
doling out charity. The “Here-you-are-my-
good-man” air with which they hand round
cups of tea brings a humorous twinkle to
the eyes of the self-reliant Australians whom
they condescend to serve ; but a little of that
sort of amusement goes a long way, and the
men soon get out of the habit of calling.
If is easier to patronise an archangel than
most of our fighting fellow-countrymen ; but
tlie dear girls haven’t the sense to realise it.
Henry Andrews, who was able to afford
a motor-car up to the very last, died the
other day after a prosperous career in the
“Lane.” He was a Malvern citizen of
considerable weight, though he never took
himself seriously as a social-dasher.
Grosvenor, where he died, belonged origin-
ally to i a once well-known Bourke-street
draper named Meares. Andrews married a
Meares daughter and they presently inherited
the dwelling and the estate which is over
tin.' road from State Government House.
Emily Sheppard, a sister of Hal Shep-
pard, of the Stock Exchange, died last week.
Of late years Miss Sheppard had been the
mainspring of a convalescent home at Wai-
ora, the old house occupied by Bowes Kelly
before he went to live splendidly as a neigh-
bor of the State Governor. Some 20 years
ago Miss Sheppard was a missionary in
India for a time, but that game was too
strenuous for a single lady of her nature,
and she came back to Melbourne. Her
father was the late Sherbourne Sheppard,
who had a squattage on the Goulburn.
Shepparton township was named after him.
Unless the rabbi took the wrong turning
on Iris way to the ceremony, architect
Plottel a day or two ago married his little
Rachel at the appointed hour, and they are
now living happily ever after. Last week
Mrs. Plottel was Dr. Rachel Gross, a
pocket-size among the feminine compendia
of medical facts yearly turned out in in-
creasing numbers by the Melbourne Univer-
sity.
The well-nourished Angelo Peppas, of
Italy, who runs the pretentious Blue Bird
Tea Gallery, has now bought a hotel on a
Swanston-street frontage of some 20ft. The
cash paid, which went into the estate of the
late Chief Secretary Gillott, ran to about
£lOOO a foot. Over the way from the Blue
Aviary, Anthony Lucas the Greek has
vacated his Paris Cafe, the freehold of the
block (part of the Dr. Howey estate) hav-
ing been acquired by Glen’s music-shop pro-
prietary. The price: £llOO a foot. Every-
thing at the Paris, down to the last fork
and pigbucket, was auctioned on Tuesday.
Lucas has bought Glen’s old shop, adjoining
the Vienna Cafe, and the whole thing is to
be knocked into one splendid trough for the
Truly Stout. Considering the fact that it
has for years been Melbourne’s most exclu-
sive restaurant, the Vienna has never lived
up to the honor, as far as size and appoint-
ments were concerned. Now we shall see.
“Bob” Strong, who gallantly' testified for
the respondent in the Wallace divorce-case,
is now Captain Robert Strong of _ the
R.A.M.C., in charge of an immense hospital-
oufit alleged to be bound for Servia. After
the Wallace case Captain Strong commenced
practising at Brunswick, where he went to
live under the parental roof. Last August
he arrived in England and was sent to Aider-
shot.
Napoleon the Boffard introduces a touch
of novelty into war concert business by
organising an entertainment at the Town
Hall as a “complimentary” to himself in
consideration of 20 years’ services to charity
whilst featuring the promise that all the
proceeds will be given to the French Red
Cross and French Baby funds. The affair
happens on Thursday, and the pre-
sence of vice-royalty is going with its pat-
ronage. A strong array of musical talent is
on the bill, and Charlotte Hemming will
pronounce the Benediction.
Forward Adelaide !
11. L. Raynor, the new Rhodes scholar, hails from
Glenelg’, and is the son of a Congregational parson
who used to be at Homebush, Sydney. In 1908 he
entered Prince Alfred College, and became a sort
of safe deposit for scholarships. The Government
medical bursary took him to the University and
launched him on his medical course at the beginning’
of this year. As expected, he came top and annexed
the Elder prize, lie is a moderately fine scholar
and a finer athlete, and at 21 is a couple of years
younger than most Rhodes scholars from here have
been.
The recruiting campaign opened at the Town Hall
on Monday, and the news is once more broken to
every man present that his King and country need
him; but some of the men who should be on band
to listen don’t attend, and the women, old men and
small boys who occupy their chairs can’t profit by
the good advice. Lord Derby’s scheme is said to be
proving a success —at the eleventh hour when the
Other Thing is at hand, and the voluntary madness
has robbed many of us of brothers, killed because
Britain didn’t have a decent army ready and a few
had to attempt the impossible.
A Returned Soldiers’ Association is being formed.
An annual parade is to be held on April 2d, and
there is to be an annual re-union. A preliminary
meeting was presided over by Major Baker, who is
on the road to recovery and has been appointed
officer in charge of troops on a transport.
Mr. McGlew has given up the Russian consul-
ship and become a full private in the S. Australian
Expeditionary Forces. He is a pillar of the Standard
Castle Salt Company and a girder of the Chamber
of Commerce.
J. H. Reed, who has retired from the manager-
ship of the Adelaide branch of the Bank of Aus-
tralasia, was farewelled at the South Australian
Hotel the other evening and given a tea service and
salver for himself and a wristlet watcli for Mrs,
Reed.
Professor Perkins, our State Director of Agricul-
ture, has been appointed to the late Barr Smith’s
place in the University Senate.
At Medindie on Saturday, E. J. Hector began the
Long Journey. He arrived in Sydney from Scotland
in ’35 with his father. For a time they settled on
Tillega station on the Patterson River, and in ’47
moved to this State. The place evidently has some
attractions.
A kindergarten and parish hall has been built at
Walkerville in memory of Archdeacon Dove, who
had lived there from 1862. The Archdeacon was
another stayer.
Friday was Sandbag Day, and produced about
£lOOO in cash and between nine and 10 thousand
bags. A bomb-proof shelter was put up
at the foot of the national memorial and at the
rear of the Clieer-Up Hut there were practical
demonstrations in trench-digging and parapet build-
ing. Mrs. Crawford Vaughan was the guiding spirit
of the movement.
Queensland maple was the stuff finally decided on
for the honor board which is to be hung in Adelaide
G.P.0., to take the names of the post-and-telegraph
men in S. Aus. who have gone to the war. it
measures 9ft. x 71ft., and will hold 250 names, two-
thirds of which are already there.
When the azaleas bloomed in the Botanic
Gardens this year there was no Mrs. Guii-
foyle to give a tea party. The Guilfoyle
son is now a lieutenant of the Flying Corps
in England, and his proud mother (wife of
the late curator of the Gardens) lives close
handy to the flying ground and far from
the hospitable teapots. The flying soldier
is engaged to Mary Taylor, daughter of the
Rev. Gould-Taylor, of Hawthorn.
Thelma Pharez Phillips has made a son
of the late David Davis, of Christchurch,
happy. Both families are so rich that merely
solvent people become bad-tempered when
they think of it.
Tewkesbury of the Oriental is worrying
about his wife and daughter, now marooned
in England. The travellers were in the
torpedoed Arabic, and ever since their nerves
have been too frayed for sea travelling. The
plump schoolgirl daughter is said to have
lost two stone since the adventure.
Nothing but the Day of Judgment will
stop the Greens’ Ball. It leaped and
whirled this year as usual, and the balcony
entrance-money was raked into the yawning
hat of Charity. The smallest children (the
ones that look about the size of eggs)
started their manoeuvres at seven o’clock,
and thereafter there was always something-
pretty happening. The little elves and
fairies were so gracefully natural that a
meeting of onlookers was held and a resolu-
tion passed that adults found dancing in a
public place hereafter should be decapitated.
All the trick dancing of the past year was
cleverly repeated by the pocket editions. But
how soon the bloom is rubbed off! I over-
heard one flapper say mournfully: “This is
the first ball I have missed for years. I
always danced a solo, and sister Betty made
my frock. But now the dresses are so fear-
fully expensive I have to give it up.”
Commodore Dagg (of the Royal Yacht
Club) and the yachting-mayoral people of
Williamstown are giving a salt-watery spree
on December 18 to welcome some of their
own returned wounded.
Linda Young, a Sydney singing flapper
with large brown eyes shining behind large
round spectacles, has been visiting Melbourne
for the past six months. Linda is the owner
of a soprano voice, and Melba thought so
much of it that she brought the young per-
son over with her and introduced her to all
the people who mention comnosers’ names
in a solemn hush. A Young song-recital is
threatened in a few months’ time.
The girls of the public schools intend
to do all they can for the wounded. Last
week they started a continuous sports cal
nival at the Warehousemen’s Ground,
St. Ivilda-road. There was a tennis tour-
nament on Thursday, Friday and Satinu,.,
and half the youth and beauty travelled
in white dresses, panama hats and nutten
silk scarves. And if one solitary n a ppe
out of the lot forgot to visit and circle t
IJlock in the course of her pilgrimage,
would like to have her name and address
for future reference. If she exists she will
be a cross-eyed deaconess in a home for lost
dogs.
Golf-champion Wliitton, who used to hit
white pills incredible distances, is oft to
bunker the King's enemies. i,ast year he
was asked to stay in England and use his
knowledge of wool to unravel some trade
problems. Now he is going to collect the
hides of hostile strangers.
Secretary Blackstock, who came with
G.-G. Ferguson, having been snatched from
the vice-regal circle by the Broken Hill
Prop. Co., is busy flat-hunting. Little Mrs.
Blackstock once governessed Lady Doris
Blackwood. She belongs to an ancient
Scottish clan, and, I am told, is a cousin of
her former pupil.
Marshall Lyle, the picturesque Melbourne
solicitor who leaped into fame years ago by
defending murderer Deeming, is said to be
at. work on a play dealing with criminals.
Lyle is a keen criminologist, and when actor
11. B. Irving was out here the two spent
many pleasant hours together discussing the
worst people they had ever known. Lyle's
other claims to notice are his infuriated
cravats and his staunch support of the Ke-
pertory Theatre.
Having crawled right off the sick list,
V.R.C. chairman Dick Casey is going to
convoy his wife to England to visit the
captain-son who is convalescing after a Gal-
lipoli illness, and admire young Dermot. who
is off from Eton to Sandhurst to qualify for
a commission. The pair depart by the Nia-
gara.
Australia is to send 13 million pounds of
jam to the British armies ; and I hope the
shippers won’t make it all plum. Lecturing
on the food-value of vegetables, Professor
Osborne begged for the fighting men as wide
a choice as possible, quoting the now-famous
example of plum-gorged heroes who had to
stop fighting in order to express their
vitriolic sentiments.
Some important Fatmen (all Fatmen are
important) were stung to a frenzy of imita-
tion last week by the example of certain
squatters who load their own wool. The
city Fats looked round to see what they
could do to prove their mettle, and decided
to raise a real working man’s perspiration
by helping the Hennessy dame pack sugar-
bags loaded with Christmas goodies for the
Gallipoli trenches. Every person who wit-
nessed their exertions feared for their strain-
ing hearts; but the event passed off without
a corpse.
Suburban matrons now rush about the
streets with bundles of calico sheets in
their arms. You see, the brown-paper par-
cel convention is dead, and sheets are the
latest craze in Red Cross sewing. So Mrs.
Pomp simply bundles up the evidence of
her industry when she wants to slip over
the way to run up the hems on Mrs. Cir-
cumstance’s machine.
An Australian stage-girl who recently
visited the U.S. and acquired a ready-to-
wear U.S. accent is on the straight road to
social unpopularity. While trying on the
accent she shed some of her Australian
common-sense and lost her geography book.
The locals were not aware of her loss until
some dames of Toorak asked her to visit
them at their homes. “Whaure is Toorak?”
questioned the great actress. Impious hussy !
The white-feather stimulant was not very
popular here, and is practically abandoned;
but sweet-girl patriots in Melbourne have
hit upon another notion and are sending
gifts that carry with them a base insinua-
tion. The hale bachelor who receives a pair
of knitted bed-socks by post is not as a rule
slow in seeing the connection between foot-
warmers and cold feet; and then there are
words, words, words. One young politician
admits having received IS pairs of the com-
forts. And his feet are still cold !
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

OH, it’s “God for King and Country !”
When Bellona mounts her car.
And the old men. fervor-drunken,
Send the young men out to war;
But it’s Devil help the women,
The gaunt, grey, toiling women,
Poor official “next of kin” —
Aye, it’s Devil help the Avomcn,
The lean, blood sweated women,
When the cripple-ships come in!
Yes! It’s “God for Right and Freedom!”
When the troops are on parade,
And it’s “Honor for the Heroes,”
Though be Death’s, the accolade ;
But it’s Devil help the Avomen,
The thin-flanked, straining Avomen,
Over-laden, toil-distort—
Aye. it’s Devil help the women,
The lion-hearted women,
When they tow the wrecks to port!
To the God of man’s law-givers,
Through the strife-lines slaughter-barred,
Pray the faithful for His mercy—
“ Favored convoy for His ward.”
So Ave pray you help the women.
Good Sir Devil, help the Avomen,
Poor official “next of kin” ;
Help the Want-cowed, driven Avomen,
Help the dumb, exploited Avomen.
W T lien the wrecks come crawling in!
To the throb of drum and trumpet
They are marching in the street;
Oh, you ravaged hearts of women,
Muffled drums that scarcely beat,
Is there none to help or hide you?
No strong power to help or hide you
From the wrath that is to be
W’hen your soul-ships, launched full-freighted,
Lust of “God” and man have sated —-
When your Avrecks come oversea?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ¥ AM quite sure,” said Mr. Salter, care-
fully brushing an atom of chocolate-
cream from his vast whiskers, and let-
ting the skirt of his frock coat modestly cover
his bony knees, “that the.blessing of Provi-
dence does not rest on speculation.”
“Not Avithout good management,” said I.
“Not even with good management! No,
I’m convinced of it! Let me tell you all
about it. It Avas after a vestry meeting that
the damage was done. A well-known and
highly-respected brother came to tell us that
he had made £6B .15s.—nearly £69 —in one
day by having but six Aveeks before invested
£lO in a prospecting Syndicate in Westraiia.
On the morning of the day of our vestry
meeting ucavs came that the syndicate had
obtained a gold-mine.”
“You mean, pegged out a lease on land
which could, might, should or Avould contain
gold.”
“Pegged out, I think, is the term. And the
shares Avent to £6B 15s. that eAmning.”
“How much are they noAV?”
“I believe nothing, but I have not inquired.
It is an accursed business. Well, this dear
brother sent off a prospecting party. Two
miners went west to find a neAV —Great Boul-
der I think they said Avas the name. We
formed the company that night. Nobody had
a share except our own brethren.”
“I see—share list exclusively of the an-
ointed.”
“One might put it that Avay. Yes ! We
had a capital of £350. after paying the regis-
tration fees of the syndicate, and on account
of my versatile knowledge I Avas elected secre-
tary. We purchased four horses and a strong
and serviceable conveyance to ship to Fre-
mantle.”
“I see. All the horses in Westraiia were
dead !”
“Not at all! But Ave decided not to trust
two comparative strangers, as these prospec-
tors were, with a great deal of ready cash.”
“But they were to be trusted with the
Oreat Boulder if they found it!”
“If you interrupt me I can’t tell the facts
of the case.”
“All right. Fire .away !”
“We gave them their passage and £4O, and
paid the freight on the horses, vehicle and
supplies. Then we heard no more of them,
but by the process of telegraphing many
times to the goldfields Ave discovered a ter-
rible condition of affairs. They had never
stirred from the township.”
“Drink?”
“You have guessed it. Alcohol! It appears
from information subsequently received that
these two persons expended all their money
on the ship. They told somebody, in some
deplorable spirit of braggadocio, that they
had consumed Avitli certain disreputable and
reckless acquaintances forty bottles described
variously as ‘bubbly’ and ‘foolish water,’
which, however, I found on inquiry to be
some aerated and fermented wine known as
champagne. A crime indeed to use money
which was practically church money, as it
Avas the substance of churchmen, in such a
reprehensible Avay. At Fremantle, having
little funds, they telegraphed us for a further
supply of that commodity, but which we in
error sent to the goldfields. It Avas a very
good error, though unfortunate for the
widow.”
“A widow in it now, eh! What widow?”
“I had neglected to introduce her to her
proper place in the story. They stayed at the
hotel of a widow in Fremantle and sold her
two of their own shares.”
“Ah, that Avas bad —horrible. Men are fair
game, but to eat the widow’s mite wasn’t the
cheese.”
“But she kept an hotel, and was it not
infinitely more reprehensible to take the
money of the congregation?”
“It might as well have been any other
gambler’s money to fit the theft, but I sup-
pose it had no marks on it.”
“We couldn’t mark it, as we paid the ad-
vances by cheque. But to resume. They
re ached the goldfields and sat doAvn to do
nothing—beyond more drink. When they
found Ave would send them no more they sold
and drank the four horses —which was a
pity, as they Avere very fine animals. Indeed
they were about to drink the vehicular appa-
ratus Avhen we appointed a local solicitor as
power of attorney and seized the turnout
and supplies. Arid then we wound up the
syndicate.”
ALLIES.
KIDDIE : “Who are those two ladies, mother ?”
MOTHER: “Oh, they belong to the Salvation Army!”
KIDDIE (whose father is in the military): “Are they on our side, mother ?”
“You could have prosecuted them. They
were plain impenitent malefactors.”
“If Ave had done so the vestry meeting
would have been brought into unpleasant
notoriety, do you see?”
“I see. So then you abandoned the specu-
lation for ever?”
“No —not till later. We had already
formed a syndicate to work guano in some
islands on the north of Australia. Manure
is not gambling, or even speculation, such as
mining is.”
“You can find a Avild cat in grocery shops.
Every game lends itself to mad speculation.
Even the manufacture of elothes-pegs can be
overdone and ruin a whole Band of Hope.”
“We did not think that manure mining
could be anything but blessed, It is inti-
mately connected with the ancient occupa-
tion of tilling the soil and making the earth
fruitful and —ep—multiply, you see; and so
Ave considered that there could be but a bene-
diction on our endeavors to salve the manure
of these sea-fowl, and bring it per sailing
ships to put new life into the more or less
exhausted or even partially wearied fields of
our fair Commonwealth.”
“I see. It was called the Altruistic Syn-
dicate of Benefactors, then?”
“Not at all! lls title was The North
West Guano Islands, Limited. The capital
was £lO,OOO, of which £50.00 was money,
and £5000”
“Was hot air and water!”
“No, promoters’ shares, and the bulk of
it went to the discoverer.”
“I remember the man —straight as a die!”
“And so was his proposition. And then
we considered we had all the essentials of
success when we engaged Captain Bagum as
supercargo.”
“Had he ever been a supercargo before?”
“He told us that he had and we believed
him. We all felt that at one time he had
led an unregenerate life.”
“That’s a degenerate one !”
“Probably it is ! But he had been an active
church worker for some three and a half or
four months, and that decided us.”
“Ever see his captain’s ticket?”
“We did not. We shipped him as super-
cargo, with power to vary the terms of the
charter. Our only protection was quite
adventitious —the signing on as assistant
supercargo of a young man, the nephew of a
church member, whose appointment we at
first opposed because we did not regard him
as a fit and proper companion for Captain
Bagum, seeing that there were tales of some
wild doings one evening at Port Melbourne,
which involved an assault with saveloys or
some such things on the keeper of a coffee-
stall, who Avas, I am given to understand, a
very irate person indeed. For this reason
we, as I say, opposed the appointment till
it was shown to us that this young man,
although not a church member, might be
won back by association Avith Captain
Bagum.”
“And, of course, the young man you were
all frightened of turned out the best of
the bunch.”
“Now, how could you possibly know that?”
“Well, it ought to happen that way, be-
cause it generally does, and I don’t like the
name of Captain Bagum. It sounds too
much like a schoolboy trying to swear.”
“Hush! Hush! But, strangely enough,
it was very much like the way you mention.
We chartered the Ocean Bride, a three-
masted ship, of 1000 tons capacity. Cap-
tain Bagum said it. was 1000 tons at any
rate, and we believed Captain Bagum. We
all went down the bay from Williamstown
to see the Ocean Bride depart. She was a
beautiful ship—at least she looked beautiful
to us then' —freighted as she was with all
our hopes, our fears, our anticipations.”
“And . the boodle of all the church
workers ?”
“Precisely! Poor fellows! Ah, the end
was unfortunate ! There was no blessing on
our undertaking and we did not increase our
store. We heard nothing of the ship foi
four months, and then we had most dis-
quieting intelligence of Captain Bagum. It
appears that after much trouble the Ocean
Bride reached the islands. Captain Bagum s
manner for some days before, we were in-
formed, had been strange. He had seemed
to shun his fellow creatures, and for quite a
week had remained almost continuously her-
metically sealed in his cabin.”
“Squareface ?”
”1 beg your pardon?”
“Squareface gin. It’s very cheap up
there.”
“You are again right. It was alcohol.
Captain Bagum, only four short weeks after
leaving the Harvest Festival of the Church
and putting to sea, had delivered himself to
the Demon. He was supercargo and they
hesitated to take from him the command of
the expedition. The assistant supercargo
landed on the island and found the guano —
—er —very prolific. The birds, he states, were
in millions, never ceasing their cries of rage
at; his intrusion. He states that the noddy-
terns tried to bite his feet off, and Ihe wide-
awakes were ready to swallow him whole ;
but this we decided —after consultation —to
regard as somewhat in the way of an
exaggeration.”
“Nesting noddies are vicious!”
“Not half as vicious as Captain Bagum.
The ship lay there, not loading, because
Captain Bagum had not completed the par-
ticulars of the charter, and I grieve to say
that when he did his condition was not lost
sight of, and advantage was taken of it to
insert the port of discharge as a port on the
eastern or southern coast of Australia instead
of specifically the port of Adelaide, the name
of the port having in the first place been
left blank that we might decide on the best
market. By the time the ship had been
there three weeks without loading there was
demurrage to the extent of £l6 13s. Id. per
diem against us, and then Captain Baguio’s
nerves suffered so much by the screaming of
the birds —that and the alcohol he had im-
bibed—that he persuaded the captain to land
him at a Dutch island where the drink of
the country, called—er”
“Squareface!”
“Squareface—thank you —was plentiful
and purchasable at a reasonable cost. So
Captain Bagum disappeared out of the story
at a moment when most of our capital was
either expended or committed to be paid.
With the aid of the new supercargo the ship
was loaded with excellent guano—rich in
phosphates of excellent nitrogen content —and
the long voyage east and south was begun.
One morning, to pay intense surprise, I was
informed that the Ocean Bride was anchored
off Williamstown, with its figurehead pointed
directly at the opposition works along the
Saltwater River. I went out to the ship and
refused to take delivery except at the port
decided on by us —which was Adelaide —but
the captain was very difficult and uncom-
promising indeed.”
“I see. Bagum and the Squareface had
ordered him to Melbourne?”
“Precisely! We fought him with solici-
tors’ letters, but he repeated his first rude
remark that he would not carry the con-
demned fowlhouse a mile to sea. Then, we
decided to wear him out. Ah, my dear sir,
in the result it was we who were worn out.”
“He had the ship and cargo. Of course
he was all right!”
“Demurrage again commanded the situa-
tion—£l6 13s. Id. per diem for a perfectly
unconscionable number of ridiculous days.
At the end —well!”
He lifted his hands with a despairing ges-
ture and let them fall helplessly upon his
knees.
“They got all!”
“More than all! Nine hundred tons of
guano disposed of at the forced sale rate of
£3 2s. 9d. per ton could not cover all our
liabilities. We were driven to liquidation
only to learn that by a further dereliction
of duty on the part of Captain Bagum the
conditions of our lease of the island had not
been observed, and the leases were therefore
cancelled. Is it not strange that in two
cases our church members should have met
serious financial loss by reason of alcohol in
that particular form you called —er”
“Squareface!”
“Squareface is the name! I shall never
forget it. In future I shall see that my in-
vestments are made with non-church mem-
bers. They are the only investments on
which there seems to be a blessing—although
I am almost convinced that money made by
speculation is much more likely to be
accursed.”
“It’s a case of getting back to work?”
“Indeed, yes, and with gratitude! For
work is blessed in itself and guano that is
got by water goes with the wind.”

of “De Reszke” Cigarettes to his Flagship, H.M.S. Iron Duke.
Since war was declared we have also received orders from nearly

King George V., etc., etc.
In the British Navy “ De Reszke ” Cigarettes outsell all other high-grade brands
—twenty to one.
There can be but one reason for this— superior quality.
During the war there is no reason why you should smoke cigarettes of inferior
Quality when you can always get the De Reszke. One box will be sufficient to
make you want them always. Remember De Reszke Cigarettes are British
made in a London factory.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Gurui” : The tiger snake that “Bareoo”
wants some information about is the only Australian
member of the family, as far as 1 know, that shows
fight unprovoked. With a cattle pup.l met one on
a pad, and in the subsequent melee the pup was
bitten. Time from bite to exit, a shade over 30
minutes. This encounter was on a rocky place in the
Burnett (Q.). In the same locality 1 once lost a
dog from blood-poisoning after he'd killed a big
carpet snake. This legless brute frequently consumes
carrion, and the poison, which is transmitted from his
teeth, doubtless accounts for the frequent legend
that the carpet is venomous. Whatever relations
“Bareoo” has with the latter, let him beware of the
tiger. That devil is twin brother to the captain of
a German submarine.
THE HERO.
MR. MEEK: “Splendid daring fellows tram conductors!”
FRIEND: “Oh, I dunno. How?”
MR. MEEK: “Why, one just told my wife to hurry up, please, AND SHE DID.”
“Long Bill”: “Bareoo” (B. 28/9/T5)
was wrong when lie said avoid sugar and you are
immune from bareoo sickness. It will occur when-
ever flies are bad or whenever fruit is eaten out of
season. Worcester sauce is the only cure that I
know of. Take about a tablespoonful with a little
water when the sickness is coming on. It will relieve
if it doesn't cure.
“Milo : \\ illie of Potsdam was not the
first to use poisonous gas. The bombardier, a nume-
rous member of the ant family, very much like a
cross between an ant and a cricket, used it for
defence purposes long before the Hun employed it.
Probably one of the numerous German spies stoic
the secret from the little Australian beast. While
prospecting at Pambula (N.S.W.) I turned over a
stone and found one of these insects underneath. I
prodded him with a stick, and in an instant there
were several sharp reports, and he discharged from
his body with each report a cloud of greenish-white
mist which hung about like smokei Sundry other
ants and crickets which were in the vicin-
ity rushed for their respirators and got out of the
misty zone in quick time. The bombardier looks like
a creature that the hand of every other creature
would be against, and for his defence nature provides
him with the noxious gas, the smell of which isn't
afraid to meet even that which arises from a dead
alligator. Pambula is the only place 1 have encoun-
tered him, but I’m told he is fairly numerous in
Gippeland (Vic.).
* * * *
“Bareoo”: This week I was introduced to
the electric-motor-driven sheep-shearing machine, and
we are going to be fast friends during the balance
of my shearing career. The power is generated by
a small dynamo driven by a petrol engine, the size
of engine and dynamo being in proportion to the
number of machines. The current is conducted on
insulated wires to small motors hanging from any
old beam or nail above the shearer’s stand. Any
make of shearing handpiece will work, and work
more successfully than by the old methods of driving
power. The friction and consequent vibration gener-
ated by the driving wheel acting on the friction
pulley for the motive power in the old headgear is
done away with; likewise the expensive headgear.
The pace is set and does not alternate as with steam,
especially when Sandy is snoozing behind his engine.
The gear runs cooler, is easier to handle, and this,
with the other advantages, means 25 sheep on an
average added to my daily tally.
* * * *
‘Act’: Re Sarto’s” (B. 4/1 l/’I.V) com-
plaint of a mysterious epidemic carrying off horses in
the Rivcrina district. I should like to know if Ihe
post-mortems were systematic or just done in any
old way. If of the latter variety perhaps the post-
mortemcr failed to examine the spleen. A parasite
called Spiraptera, while ordinarily harmless, or
comparatively so, occasionally has a nasty habit of
causing ulcers or perforations of the stomach wall,
which perforations allow certain bacteria to get into
the spleen, where they raise trouble in the shape of
abscesses. These splenic abscesses have been killing
numbers of horses in parts of the country, the
slightly-abncrmal spleen being about the only post-
mortem sign. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get
such drugs into the stomach as would teach Spirap-
tera better manners.
“Yarrum”: I had always thought the
death-adder was never longer than 2ft. until I
killed a reddish-colored one between Wyee and
Catherine Hill Bay (N.S.W.) that measured 27in.
Since then bushmen have told me they have killed
them up to 3ft. in length ; but 1 hardly ever believe
bushmen, especially when they wear patent-leather
boots.
A SAFEGUARD.
MRS. OTOOLE (pawning iced ding
ring): “Sure, Cohen darlint,
couldn’t ye lend me an ould
brass ring to wear till I get me own
out agin? If the bogs see me
widout one they'll be thinkin’ I’m
a spinster, an’ Oi’ll hev no peace
at all, at all.”
The - following telegram tore into The
Bulletin office the other day :
End of the Northern Territory drought. Darwin’s
accumulated wealth in snake juice is now being
retailed—white rum (manufactured from r.ice and
peanut oil) 12s. 6d. per pint bottle; cockroach
square gin. 355. bottle; whisky, 40s. bottle, but now
unprocurable excepting at Government House. Agi-
tator’s syrup, decoction of kerosene, painkiller and
essences of guava, can be had at 15s. per bottle;
Old Jock Brandy (pandanus nut-juice and frilled-
lizard gall), 225. per 'drachm; unionist club lager
decoction (hops, arsenic and yam), ss. bottle. A
most up-to-date beverage is now being distilled and
will be put on the market as graveyard blend
(manufactured from Warrego bilge water, Leich-
hardt palm oil and construction store debris), price
yet unfixed.
“Saint” : The ancient question as to when
a man may reasonably be called drunk was satisfac-
torily answered at Masterton, one of Maoriland’s pro-
hibition towns, the other day. A convivial gentleman
was charged at the police-court with having tco much
of a load on in a railway carriage ; and while admit-
ting the slight exhilaration, denied strenuously any
greater lapse. But the evidence of the guard was
fatal. He stated that the convivial soul, being in
the-possession of two bottles, one full of beer and
the other empty, cast away the full one and retained
the dead marine. Convicted immediately, and may
the Lord have mercy on his soul !
“Te Pana : Tapa cloth beaten from the
bark of the “paper mulberry” tree is common to
most of the Polynesians in the Pacific Islands. The
Ilawaiians, until the civilisation of the U.S.A. struck
them, dressed extensively in this natural-bark cloth.
The dress of the women consisted of the pan, about
half a dozen yards in length and width, passed
several times round the waist and extending below
the knee. The depss of the men was malo, which
corresponds with the lulu or puree or lavalava. In
Samoa and other coral deposits the wearing of tapa
apparel is still common. So popular was the fabric
in the former place that a few years ago an enter-
prising Hun sent samples to the city on the Spree,
where they were carefully imitated, and whole belts
of tapa design in rotten cotton were returned to the
Isles to gladden the heart of Losa. Hori seems to
be the Only one of the Polynesian family that forgot
to plant his bit of paper mulberry in the back-
yard. The Maori was always a casual beggar; and,
anyhow, blankets were cheap a hundred years after
he hit the Rickety Isles.
* * * *
“Rakau”: Talking of feet, the Auckland
papers tdl of a Niue native now in camp with the
Maori contingent at Takapuna who couldn’t get boots
big enough to fit him ; his feet ran to 131 inches,
with a beam in proportion. Until a bootbuilder could
be called in to lay down the keel for a special pair
the Savage Islander had to remain barefoot. Which
reminds me of Tom Adamson, Major Kemp’s pakeha-
Maori, and he took the trail with the Government
scouts in many a Maori-war expedition. He threw
off his trousers with much joy when he left camp or
barracks, and in the bush marched much as the
brown men did, in shawl-kilt, with a tomahawk
stuck handily through the belt at the small of the
back. He always marched barefooted, for the suffi-
cient reason that he could never get a pair of boots
big enough to enclose his pediments, which measured
14 inches by the stop-watch. The big scout some-
times wore flax sandals, Maori mountaineer fashion,
but he preferred, like the Niue man, to go without.
Also and by the way, he carried his turned-up ends
with a fearless daring which won him the M.L.
Cross for a specially plucky bit of work during
Whitmore’s march through the Urewera country in
’6O.
“-T.G.” : As the snake season is round
once more, 1 wish to point out that a lot of
risky mistakes are made regarding the most com-
mon variety of poisonous crawler found south of the
Dividing Range (Vic.). About 11 persons out of
every dozen persist in calling this the black
snake; hence not much notice is taken of it, as
that variety contains very little poison in its
hollow tooth. The snake that is called the black
in south Victoria is not the black at all, but is
really the copperhead, one of our most poisonous
reptiles, and capable of dealing out death nearly as
quickly as the tiger, which in turn is almost as bad
as the Indian cobra. The true black snake is coal
black on the back and bright pink underneath, and
the copperhead is slaty black on top and whitish-
yellow underneath, with a tinge of bronze about
the head. The only reason the copperhead provides
so few corpses is that it is about the most timid
and least offensive of all local snakes, and will not
strike unless it cannot escape. The true black shows
fight at the first opportunity, whilst the tiger is
always ready for a scrap, and is the most dangerous
of the Vic. collection.
* * * *
“Pat O’Riot” : In reply to "Jaques” (B.
4/11/’l5), who asks how to rid horses of bloodsuck-
ing flies, my own experience is that oil of penny-
royal beats the rest into a cocked hat. Attach
flannel to the harness at the most convenient spots
(strips one inch wide will do) and saturate with the
oil. I’m surprised that phenyl failed ; also, I’m
surprised a horseman used it. It’s cruelty.
“T.F. ’: Recent fires in the Dorrigo
(N.S.W.) brought down some tallow-wood giants.
One of the family measured 30ft. in diameter at
the ankle, and stretched upwards 200 ft. When the
local bullocky gets this log to the mill the hun-
dreds of thousands of feet will bring in a decent
cheque. However, there are still armies of giant
hardwoods in this fertile stretch which reaches from
the Bellinger on the Coast Range along the Macleay
Range to New England. When the job of picking
our the more classic timber (rosewood, white maple,
white cedar, myall, marblewood, ash, etc.) is over,
there will still be years of work before the miller
packs his duds for a new “pit.”
(Continued on page 26.)
THE NEW DEITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was the ebb of battle,
The sun sank in the west,
And back we brought our captives,
Old Ahmed with the rest.
Poor Ahmed’s face looked downcast,
His hatless head was bowed,
He seemed of all the captives
The saddest in the crowd.
Wo asked him of his sorrow.
Said he: “No human rods
Pain as the whips of doubt do —
Of doubts about one’s gods.
This morn we held our trenches ;
This morn at dawn of light
We made our call to Allah —
You hold the trench to-night 1
Oft in the midst of conflict
We called for Allah’s aid,
For faith was in our bosoms,
And we were unafraid.
We called for Allah’s succor,
And yet your strength prevailed ;
You see in me the sorrow
Of one whose gods have failed.
He bowed his head still lower,
A passive slave to Fate.
“We beard you call on Blanky.
The Christian gods are great!”
N.S.W.
HAMER.
WAR ON WOMEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He loved a girl when his hair was brown,
And his heart was young and tender,
And she took him up and she took him down,
So lie’s got no time for that gender.
He's a “whaler” now with a patched-up boat,
By a Murrumbidgee station,
With an old hc-dog and a William-goat
And a cat of the Thomas persuasion.
There's a Nanny-goat’s skin with the head and horns
On a gum-tree tall and shady ;
And hair like a long-lost gin’s that warns
The native dusky lady.
There’s the skin of a female dog as well,
And, nailed up a little bit higher,
The skin and tail of a tortoise-shell
They used to call Maria.
There is also a tale with the station gins,
Who are scarcely ornamental,
Of a shot-gun charged with the coarsest salt,
That “went off accidental.”
So he lives in peace, with his patched-up boat.
By that Murrumbidgee station—-
And his old lie-dog and his William-goat
And his cat of the Thomas persuasion.

Four Features of
The Vocation
The Sound Box
which produces a rich, mellow and
rounded depth of tone and does away
with all suggestion of nasal stridency
The Symphonetic Horn
which preserves all the subtle tonal
characteristics of different instru-
ments and voices, and produces for
the first time from an instrument
even such delicate effects as the wist-
ful “string-beauties ” of violins and
the mellow “wood-tones” of flutes
and clarinets
The Automatic Stop
a new triumph of simplicity and
efficiency ; only two movements are
required to “set” the record to stop at
any place desired and start it playing
And the Wonderful Graduola
which confers the wholly new privi-
lege of perfect and artistic tone-
control
It lets you play the instrument with
all the musical feeling you possess.
If an interpretation suits you or has
not yet become monotonous, you let
it play itself, as it does on other
models. But at any moment and
on any record you can introduce just
the subtle variations needed to make
it sound freshly new and to express
your own individuality, as well as
the artist’s
Added to these advantages is a sim-
ple dignity of line and finish wholly
unapproached in instruments before
and impossible to convey in a mere
illustration

“Senex”: I’ll lay 10 to one on North
Queensland jitto to beat “Mulga’s” (B. 14/10/’l5)
ironwood for hardness, heaviness and uselessness; but
it will burn —with a furious white heat, green or dry.
It never is more than a foot or 18in. in diameter,
but it’ll take a good quarter-hour, chopping very
gingerly, to get one down. Then your axe is a very
fair imitation of a saw. I guarantee it to take the
edge off the temper of any man and the edge and
the temper off any saw.

“Verdad,” concerning an animal that
would be useful to Australia if this continent were
as high as it is wide: —•
The llama (no, don’t pronounce it that way ; it’s
wrong) of the Andes shows a good all-round record
of usefulness. Its wool is very long and strong, and
makes excellent suitings, much better than ordinary
wool. Its flesh is moderately good eating, but the
Indians consider the animal too valuable to kill for
eating when they’re hungry; so, as a rule, it is only
used for meat when it dies. Its dung, called taquia,
makes first-class fuel, in a country where fuel is
scarce; and the llama most obligingly makes its
deposits in selected spots. It is a fair pack animal,
carrying a hundredweight about 10 miles a day, and
flourishing meanwhile on stones and -ether odds and
ends —it is 'never fed, but picks up enough food
from the scanty vegetation growing at an altitude of
anything over 10,000 feet. Below that level the
llama does hot flourish. It also serves another use
that residents in the Andes know of, but of which I
refrain from giving particulars here.

“Enzedder” : The friends of the automatic
pistol say a lot in recent Bulletin pars, about its
power being superior to that of the revolver. Writer
thinks this is no advantage, although he is a believer
in the superiority of the pistol. Both are essentially
short-range weapons. It doesn’t matter whether the
weapon carries 100 or 1000 yards so long as it stops
a man before he reaches you. And for this pur-
pose there is nothing better than the old lead
bullet, such as is generally used in revolvers. The
high-velocity, nickel-coated bullet is not so good,
although it travels farther and has greater penetra-
tion. Automatics would be. better if they used the
round-nosed lead bullet, which flattens out and
knocks your man down. Nickel-coated, pointed
bullets may go right through a man and not
stop him, and it is not much comfort to you, after
being killed, to know that you have mortally
wounded your adversary.

“D.F.”: There is a glass factory some-
where in space, and some time or other a big shower
of the output hit the West Coast of Tasmania, and is
now lying loose on the surface or scattered through
the soil to a depth .of nine or 12 inches over a strip of
country nine miles long by 20 chains wide. Running
parallel to the North Lyell railway are thousands of
fragments of natural glass ranging from the size of
a pin’s head to pieces 2} inches long and nearly an
inch wide. The prospectors who first noticed it
called it petrified kelp, but when Assistant-Geologist
Hills got hold of a few specimens he saw that it was
neither petrified nor kelp. He submitted several
pieces to Professor F. E. Suess, the leading authority
on cosmic glasses, who inclined to the opinion that
the substance was of meteoric or extra-terrestrial
origin, though he thought it might possibly be vol-
canic glass. The latter alternative is, however, ruled
out both by the chemical composition and by the
conditions under which the glass is found. Therefore
the theory of a meteoric origin holds the field. The
most striking feature shown by the chemical analysis
is that the glass contains 89 per cent, of silica, which
is higher than had previously been recorded for any
glass, whether natural or artificial. A curious thing
about the distribution of the stuff is that while it
is persistent over a strip of country nine miles long
running along the lower slopes of a range of hills, it
NOTHING NEW TO HIM.
“You seem to he a cool hand in danger!”

is nowhere found near the summits, 'its
upper limit being marked by a line about 1200 feet
above sea-level. Save for a couple of sporadic in-
stances further west its existence, as far as is known,
is confined to this long, narrow strip. Ardent search
has been made for a supply of natural beer which
might have been spilled when Jove threw out the
bottle, but with no success so far.
“Barcoo”: In this best-timber argument
no one seems inclined to champion Vic. red gum, the
best and most versatile of them all. Amongst other
things, it serves as naves of wheels, wheel-spokes,
furniture, railway sleepers and the very best hard-
wood boards for building, and it out-lives its next-
best relative, jarrah, as piles, etc., submerged in
sea-water. A pile of red gum some years ago was
drawn out from a breakwater in Port Adelaide after
being submerged for 46 years, and was found to be
just nicely preserved. Jarrah beside it showed
signs of decay. Red gum makes the very finest of
fencing timber when split. Dryrot and white-ants
it treats with contempt. And in the wheelwright’s
shop it serves every purpose, except where pine is
essential,, especially as shafts for vehicles of heavy
draught.
* * * *
“Jobber”: If it’s not too late I’d like to
poke my head out of a tent in Egypt and butt into
this hard wood argument and introduce the lapunyah
(not too certain of the spelling, but that’s the way
it’s pronounced). I’ve cut mulga, myall, gidya and
one or two other kinds, to keep “barbel’s” busy in
the back country, but when I want really solid toil
I’ll look for lapunyah. As they say in the army,
“It’ll do me.”
■* * * #
“Nick Bottom”: If it’s not too late for
the wood-for-fuel-cim-all-purposes stakes I would
like to enter Australian teak, or, as it is called in
Queensland, crow’s-ash. I have seen this timber
burning in the open during a spell of wet weather
that was a holy terror to ducks, and, what is more,
I’ve heard its praises sung by a cane-cutter’s cook.
No further testimony is needed. As building timber
it is hard to beat, and is extensively used for
scantling, and weather-boards. It is also used for
“wire” posts, and stands the weather (Tweed River
weather at that) better than any other timber I
have seen. After a couple of years’ exposure it
becomes as hard as the Devil’s bargains. A teak
“windfall” is just about as tough a proposition as
any bushman cares to tackle with an axe, while it
is about as easy to saw as cast-iron. I’ve tried
cutting it down, but next time I’m going to have a
shot at pulling it up by the roots.
“Swamp Oak”: Re “De Oriel’s” par (B.
4/11/’l5) about the late Professor Davis, snake-
charmer. I can vouch for the efficacy of his anti-
dote as applied to himself, but I never heard of
anyone else using it effectively. When I met him I
was chief musician (accordeon) to a small circus
run by Martini, of the buckjump show. It was at
Burnie (Tas.), and I saw the Prof, bitten by a tiger
snake that had previously killed a pigeon in lmin.
30sec. He showed his bleeding arm to the excited
audience, and then went out of the tent for about
five minutes while two local doctors guarded the box-
containing the reptile. On Davis’s return the snake
killed a pigeon in less than a minute. But the boss
was all right. However, step up anyone who knows
(not hearsay) of some person saved by these snake-
charmers—such as Fox, Davis or Morrissey. Strych-
nine barred.
“Pick”: “Paroo Joe” goes nap (B.
11/11/’l5) on mulga as the champion cattle-fodder
tree. My trump card is an unnamed jungle brush
tree which clothes the poorer soil regions about Mt.
Dromedary and all South Coast (N.S.W.) ravines.
It has a slender, pithy stem and a flappy leaf, green
above and light brown beneath. The plant may be
eaten to the ground every month in the year during
droughty times, but springs up more bunchily after
each successive assault. Cattle fed upon it appear
to prefer it to the best grass, and they rush it on
every opportunity. Indeed, the only animal that
seems to undervalue the plant is the cocky, who
roots out acres of it where nothing else will grow
and uses it for bonfire effects.
“Wandi”: The crow is a cunning fowl.
You may shout at him in a tree, .or clap your hands,
and he will look down with one eye half-shut and say
“Gur-r-r-r!” But point a stick at him or anything
that resembles a gun, and he recollects another en-
gagement right away. His rascally brother, the raven,
is even more cunning. He knows a poor horse from
a fat one, and will dance on the animal’s back, squint
around at its eyes to ascertain the state of its health,
peck it here and there and comment on the pro-
bable quality of the meat, and crack jokes about it.
He knows a bushed man, and as he follows from tree
to tree, noting the man’s bewildered demeanor, his
gibes are quite sarcastic. He can tell a sick sheep at
a glance, and will hang on the poor brute’s neck and
peck its eyes out, and then dig a hole through its
back and feed on the innards. Watch half a dozen of
them walking along behind a feeding lamb, talking
to one another! They will follow a dingo on the
warpath for miles. They are up to his game, and
know well enough they will come in for the pick-
ings. In central parts the flood-bird jumps the nest
of the crow, throws out the latter’s eggs, and deposits
its own. The crow hatches the latter, and feeds the
young flood-birds until they are pretty we ® ’
by which time Mrs. Crow begins to have suspi • •
When these are confirmed the little aliens aie ro »
and wrathfully fired out to battle for
pink-eared duck also appropriates the nows
raven’s nest, constituting thereby a remarkable
anomaly in bird-life, for the crow’s sharp eyes a.re
always on the lookout for eggs secreted in sue 11 *7',
as the average duck makes in rank grass, hn re
flood-bird, the pink-eared duck turns the crow out
and hatches its own eggs. A duck laying anc si
ting in a twig nest built on the branch of a tree
is in itself a curious departure from the habit of t e
family.

“Barcoo”: Let me say to “Jas. Stewait
(B. 28/11/’l5) and his water-divining boy prodigy
that any so-called diviner in the district mentione ,
Windsor (N.S.W.), would be quite safe in picking any
likely spot as having water at the bottom of a hole,
say, 65ft. deep. Anywhere about there, except
from the top of a hill, water can be tapped
at or under that depth. Strange that the operatoi
always chooses a likely-looking locality before getting
to work with his' fake, knowing that the betting is
about 50 to 1 on that soakage can be found if the
hole is deep enough. Stranger still, one never heai s
them publishing their failures, which are numerous
and generally costly to the other chap. If the credulous
believers in the divining cult will read up the early
records of the trick they will find that it was prac-
tised by the Druids in the British Isles a thousand
years ago, when the aborigines roamed the bush. The
camp was only pitched after the head serang had
gone through a mysterious ceremony with his willow
wand. He was just as great a confidence man as
his descendant is to-day, and a little more blindly
believed in.
“Jacaranda”: Re “Bandy Andy’s” re-
marks on the fact of clear glass changing color
when tying exposed along the river banks in West
Queensland (B. 4/11/M5). The same thing is
common in other parts of Queensland, in the River-
ina, Broken Hill and Darling River districts of
N.S.W., on the Outback goldfields of Westralia, and
in Tasmania. In Tasmania I have seen glass squares
that had been let into the pathway to give light to
underground rooms being renewed because the origin-
ally clear glass had changed to purple. About five
years ago a chemist found some in the Northern
Territory that made him think he was on the track
of big radium deposits, because salts of radium has
the same change-of-color effect on crystal. As far
back as 1905 an interested Sandgroper had speci-
mens submitted to Mr. Soddy, lecturer on radio-
active matter in the Glasgow University, and one of
the highest authorities in the world on radium. He
decided that, not radium, but ultra-violet rays were
mainly the cause of the coloration. These rays are
more intense in the sunlight of high altitudes, and
consequently the change takes place more quickly in
such places, which might account for the fact that
some well-colored specimens of glass were picked up
around Coolgardie only about 12 years after the
discover}' of the field. Identical color effects are also
produced by X-rays (as in a focus tube which has
been in long use) and the ultra-violet rays of the
mercury lamp. In all cases the color disappears on
heating, which can be easily proved by anyone
interested placing some of the violet glass on a
shovel and holding it over a fire. The reason the

THE CRITICAL FRIEND : “I saw them, dear
hoy, I saw them. Bat they were quite

danger!”
glass in window-panes does not change color is
because the ultra-violet rays do not strike it at the
right angle. The roofs of glass houses do change
color. According to Mr. Soddy they even change
color in England, where there is no sunshine worth
talking about. The presence of manganese in glass
has also probably something to do with the change,
and the reason why it has only been noticed during
the last few years might be due to some compara-
tively recent change in the process of glass manu-
facture.
PICTURES
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Can’t be bothered with pictures!”
She said it just so,
And passed some brief strictures
On ones that I know
Are perfectly splendid. Then, in the
same breath:
“Can’t be bothered with pictures—they
bore me to death!”
At her own sweet reflection
She smiled (little cat!).
With grave contemplation
She patted her hat,
And happily sighed at her image so true:
“Oh, pictures! I think they are silly—
don’t you?”

That Awful
Agonising'
BACKACHE
s
-y
Oh!
my Back
Backache means one thing and one thing only —Kidney Trouble —which is most cer-
tainly on the increase. Thousands and thousands of people in the towns and villages of this
country are in terrible danger of deadly kidney disease, if they only knew and realised it.
This insidious disease creeps on, gradually getting a firmer and firmer grip, until when
it is too late the poor sufferer discovers he has Bright’s Disease. Have you kidney trouble?
Do you know how to recognise whether you are suffering from this or not?
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney disease: Aches and pains in various parts of
the body, nasty taste in the mouth first thing in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness and irritability, puffiness under the eyes —these
are all
Symptoms o/ Kidney Trouble
And then people who suffer from backache, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gray el, stone
or pains in the bladder, muscles and joints are all suffering these pains through weak or
diseased kidneys, for these are the sure and certain symptoms of kidney trouble.
All these things mean that the kidneys are weak and diseased. They need strengthen-
ing and making healthy.
Don’t Avaste a single hour. Go at once, and get a box of De W itt s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, which are made expressly for kidney and bladder troubles. They will cure
every one of the above symptoms no matter how long or lioav badly you have suffered.
To cure. Kidney Trouble of any kind you must positively get rid of the cause—the
poisonous [Trio Acid. Remember, to do this, a real remedy must pass through the kidneys
and the bladder and not through the boAvels, as most kidney pills do. When you see the
urine change to a muddy, bluish color—a feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills from all
others—you know beyond all doubt that they have put their healing touch on the right spot
the kidneys and the bladder. And the cost is so small. Do not put off, because Aveak kid-
nevs very often mean Bright’s Disease in the end, and then it will be too late. Be Avise in
time. But when you buy the pills be sure you get DE WITT’S, in large, Avhite boxes printed
in blue and gold —AA r itb a blue AA r ax seal on the top of the bottle. Refuse any of similai nam< >
without this special seal.

“Ami’s” send-off: —
Exit .Toe Winter, of the Advocate. Sam and -Toe
were brothers, and entered printing offices as young-
sters. Sam, married at 20 on a pound a week, had
to hit out. The task he grappled with was almost as
difficult as Prime Minister’s Hughes’s. Of such
stuff is success made. Sam began as compositor with
W. H. Williams and Co. At 25, on Duffy’s advice,
he joined the weekly Advocate, an R.C. organ.
O’Reilly failed with the rival Victorian. Soon Sam
became the most notable Catholic layman, next to
O’Shanassy and Duffy, and was president of St.
Patrick’s Society. Then he turned attention to the
evening Herald, as part-proprietor and manager,
developing into editor also when Jim Middleton had
been his warming-pan long enough. He passed over
the Advocate to brother Joe, not so large in body
or mind, but large enough. Sam, indeed, lost the
Advocate degree of religious intensity, and became a
Liberal, like Chief Justice Madden, who had been for a
brief time his schoolfellow at St. James’s, Richmond.
Joe remained quite within the fold. It would not be
fair to hint that such an admirable man knew on
which side his bread was buttered. As the David
Syme of the Advocate, though with easy sailing,
only to go round the machinery, literary and other-
wise, with the oilcan, Joseph Winter evinced an
ability which ranks him not so very far behind
lirother Sam.
* * * *
“Nemo”: The Advocate, Joe Winter’s
paper, was started away in the 60’s of last
century by Michael O’Grady, who was secre-
tary to a Melbourne insurance co. and an
M.L.A. He could not well appear upon the
surface as the. proprietor, so he got S. Y.
Winter, the overseer in a Melbourne print-
ing office, to be visible boss.' “S.V.” took his
brother James into the new R.C. weekly as
accountant, and his other brother Joseph as
publisher and general rouseabout. Years after
this, Mick O’Grady and a few others bought
the Melbourne evening Herald, and then
S.'V. Winter was shoved on to that. Joe
was the last of the trio to go. He ran the
Melbourne R. C. organ for 40 years or so.
He was not a bright journalist himself, but
he knew a capable man when he saw one, and
he always managed to have a couple about
him.

“J.F.H.,” from London : —-
Our Press Club has been giving a dinner and
making presents to one of its founders and patri-
archs, a veteran sub-editor named Collingham, who
has scored 80 and is still going strong. He has
spent 50 years on Fleet-street without a break, 45
of them in the service of the Morning Advertiser,
the daily mouthpiece of “the trade.” This is the
most curious of the London morning papers. It is
seldom if ever seen or read by the general public,
its circulation is almost entirely confined to brew-
eries and pubs. It bears the imprint: “Printed and
published by the Society of Licensed Victuallers, the
proprietors, at 127 Fleet-street.” All its profits go
to the licensed victuallers’ charitable funds and
asylums. It was established in 1794 by a combina-
tion of publicans and coffee-house keepers, but the
latter soon dropped out. To a non-alcoholic reader
the Morning Advertiser is anything but an exhil-
arating production. It caters so exclusively for the
tastes of the trade that even the war has to sneak
into a back seat in its pages.
■ “Verdad”: South America has some good
newspapers. The Buenos Aires La Prensa
(The Press) is an outstanding example, but
I know the Chilean journals better. El
Mercurio is published in Santiago, Val-
paraiso and Antofagasta, a different edition
for each place. The first of these is written
in pure Castillian —a strange thing in a
country that speaks Spanish worse than
even tiie Yanks speak English. Some of its
articles are models of literary Spanish. It
lias its own cable service for war news, and
has retained some of the foremost Spanish
writers to send articles dealing with the
war. It aims at giving impartial news from
a neutral's standpoint, but has decided pro-
British and pro-French leanings. It is
published seven days a week, and has an
afternoon edition on week days, called Las
Ultimas Nottcias (The Latest News).
The price is 10 centavos Chilean —a little
less than one penny. It is about the size
of the leading Sydney dailies. It receives
most of its cables in English, and publishes
any very important British news in the
original English as well as in Spanish. This
was done, for example, with Sir Edward
Grey’s masterly reply to Chilean protests re
the sinking of the Dresden by the Glasgow
in Chilean territorial waters. Incidentally,
this violation of Chilean neutrality did more
good to the British cause in Chile than a
strict observance of Chile’s rights would
have done. Grey’s reply was so cleverly
worded that Chile’s amour propre was
flattered, without any loss of British dignity.
Chile was proud that England had treated
her as an equal. In effect, she could boast
to the other South American Republics that
she alone had received an apology from the
great British Empire—an honor far above
their wildest hopes. Illustrations in
Chilean papers and magazines are generally
very poorly reproduced. The value of large
pictures is not understood ; nearly all views
are too small. They are great on horrors.
There are always photos, of the victim —
after death —in any accident or murder
case. Views of the execution of criminals
—this is done by shooting—are often shown.
Some of the country papers are interesting.
Ei. Tiempo (The Times) is published in
Potosi (Bolivia) about five times a week,
but suspends publication when the owner
and editor goes for a holiday. It costs 20
centavos Bolivian —about 4d.—and consists
of four pages. It seldom troubles to
follow up its news. For instance, it
published a cable one Christmas Eve that
King George had been assassinated in India,
and then - it never mentioned the subject
again, and left us wondering.
“Musketoon”: When Allan Campbell
Wood passed out the other day, after pilot-
ing the Yass (N.S.W.) Courier through
close on 50 stormy years, there was a danger
that the old rag would fade into oblivion.
But the reins were taken by the chief’s
daughter Ida, and the situation was saved.
In N. S. Wales several women run
country curlpapers. Mrs. Gilmartin has
the Liberal, Crookwell; Mrs. Leatham, the
Express, Molong; and Miss Reynolds, the
Chronicle, Young. In former days I saw
old man Pinkstone’s daughters setting type
at the Herald office, Cootamundra, and
Spencer Grove’s,.girls did the same at Tumut
(N.S.W.). The just-departed Allan Wood
was the worst copy-writer I have ever seen,
and comps went baldheaded in trying to
decipher liis strange characters.

“ Jobber” : This is how I find Australian
literature introduced to a newly-interested
public. I’ve been to every bookshop in
Cairo in search of a copy of Adam Lindsay
Gordon’s poems, but there is not one to be
had. Of course there is nothing in that to
write home about, but in all these shops 1
saw books with weird pictures of ladies on
the cover, each one with a “Don’t-beat-me-
to-night-.Tim” expression on her dial. On
examining these I found -them to he “works”
on the white slave trade by our old friend
Nick Willis.
* * * *
A libel action by a newspaper and against
a parson is not often threatened, but
Adelaide Register has been talking of one
against Donald McNicol, who seemed to
suggest from the pulpit that the war cables
were unreliable through local faking. How-
ever, on being given by a lawyer a chance
to prove it, he got out by expressing “deep
and sincere regret” and so forth, whereupon
action was abandoned. The Register now
triumphantly waves its tail, remarking that
to accuse a paper of faking its news is just
the same, in the eye of the law, as accusing
a grocer of putting sand in the sugar, and
that in future “prompt and vigorous pro-
ceedings will be taken against all slanderers,
malicious or otherwise.” So as “all slan-
derers” are to get it, S. Aus. may yet have
the joy of seeing The Register vigorously
prosecuting itself for the silly slander of
describing every individual Laborite candi-
date as “Socialist.”
“O’Phimerty”: As Australia’s most pro-
lific book-writer I enter F. W. Boreham, a
Baptist parson of Hobart. In a little over
three years he has produced four volumes,
averaging 300 pages each. Ilis work, all
published in London, is mainly semi-
religious, and’sells as well as anything in
its class. Boreham also does a little leader
writing for Hobart Mercury.
“Will G. Buck” : The editor and propri-
etor of the • Georgetown (Q.) paper, the
Mundic Miner, the other day took it into
his head to do his bit against the Turks,
and straightway went about g^J®
readers are still waiting, but tb Kp | a i n
that won’t hurt them and he 11 e- 1
things when he comes back.

From a confirmed sub-editor:
Leaving out the question whether w£ ( r . y _
pondent Bean’s stuff is mostly tripe or not, -
one who has had to handle his stuff m the ioup
knows that he has mighty little idea of w ti =
telegrams, and it would pay the Commonwealth to
send someone over to lick his messages m o P 1
cabling form. A cablegrammer wlio puts the '
“stop” at the end of each sentence has too low a
opinion of the intelligence of cable editors. inert
he lugs in all manner of superfluous phrases, a
which cost the Federal Government or the newspapers
something. Thus his account of the torpedoing o
the Southland states that the last boat to leave that
vessel • carried a General and officers who, he
solemnly affirms, were “travelling by the vessel.
As to the general value of Bean’s stuff it .is su ’~
picious that his defenders generally weigh in wi
something about his carrying the wounded to shelter
or walking about unmoved under a hail oi hie.
Good for him ; but what on earth has it to do with
the value of his messages?
At present a person who sues f° r
libel can bring bis action against the
owners of the machine on which the alleged
libel was printed, although they may have no
responsibility in the matter. This makes
jobbing printers chary of publishing journals
that incline to be outspoken, unless they sive
given substantial indemnity against loss ; also
the struggling country newspaper which
wants to get its plant on terms is given the
cold eye by suppliers, who don’t care to run
the risk of losing the but lialf-paid-for outfit
owing to a libel action. It is mainly to give
the country press a lift in this matter that
a handy Bill to amend the Defamation Act
has been introduced to the N.S.W. Parlia-
ment.
* * * *
“Sr”: The lifting of phrases without
acknowledgment, of which complaint is
made against O’Malley, is a practice
amongst politicians more general than colds
in winter. Deakin’s “necklace of negatives”
and many of Billy Hughes’s epigrams are
“lifts.” Even Dick Toutcher in his out-
break against Peacock for not giving him a
portfolio came out with: “You can’t put a
Liberal cow-rug on a horse and expect milk.
It was a lift from a bit of recently-published
doggerel about Germans always being Ger-
mans. I’ve noticed that the steals are most
frequent when the House is in committee
over some copyright legislation or a Protec-
tion of Patents Bill.

THE RULING PASSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We often sling the Turks a bit of rhyme.
—Queensland soldier’s letter.
The Turkish shells fell thick and fast,
Our heroes stood undaunted,
Although by death and hell their trench
At time was truly haunted.
Bill looked at Jim and Jim at Bill
Beneath the smoke of Krithia’s hill.
They crouched within their dugout low,
Nor dared to cut a caper,
But Jim with eager hand laid hold
On pencil and on paper ;
Ho ran his fingers through his hair—-
His eye was lit with frenzied glare.
Then down he dashed with lightning speed
The thoughts that through him darted :
“You blanky Turks, just draw your dirks,
It's time fair fightin’ started ;
This shooting, Ah., is poor and tame,
Just try your bay'nets, if you’re game!
“For Jim and me will meet you fair
In any decent tussle,
And show you quickly what's the worth
Of tough Australian muscle;
So, if you come, you’ll find us home....
And, till you do, accept a pome!”

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call, them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

NEVER MASSAGE YOUR WRINKLES.
MASSAGE ONLY STRETCHES THE SKIN, MAKING IT MORE LOOSE AND WRINKLED THAN EVER. PLASTERS

Wow to tighten loose, inelastic and flaccid skin without any of these harmful and dan-
gerous methods, f amous beauty at last reveals how she permanently banished everj
trace of line or wrinkle in a single night. Any reader ca ido the same by means
of this accidental discovery, a jealously-guarded secret no longer.
By ELEANOR LAWTON.
Years of trouble, worry and ill-health had
seared and seamed my face with deep, repul-
sive and disfiguring wrinkles. My skin hung
in loose, flaccid folds which not only marred
my appearance, making me look nearly twice
my real age, but I realised that they were
constantly growing worse, and would greatly
interfere with my success, because a woman’s
success in life, either socially or financially,
depends to a very great extent upon her ap-
pearance. The plain, unattractive woman
whose face bears a network of tell-tale lines,
proclaiming that youth has long since
departed, must indeed fight an unequal battle
in competing
with her
younger and
more attrac-
tive sisters.
Almost in
despe ration
therefore I
bought and
tried various
kinds of skin
foods, and
massaged my
face with
most con-
stant regu-
larity, hoping
to regain my
former youth-
ful appear-
ance. But the
wrinkles sim-
ply would not
go. On the contrary, they seemed to grow
deeper, and my skin was stretched more than
ever. Next I went to various beauty special-
ists, who assured me they could easily rid me
•of my wrinkles. I paid my money in each
case and took the treatment. Sometimes I
thought my face looked better, but after
spending all the money I could afford for
such treatments I found I still had my
wrinkles. So I finally gave up in despair,
and concluded I must carry them to my
grave.
But: one day a friend of mine made a sug-
gestion that gave me a new idea. I immedi-
ately set to work making experiments and
studying everything I could find on the sub-
ject. After several long months of almost
numberless trials and discouragements I
finally discovered a method by which, in a
single night:, I banished every trace of line or
wrinkle from my face. In a short time I
noticed that the skin was no longer so loose
and thm that it would separate from tissues
beneath when I pinched the skin between my
fingers On the contrary, the skin seemed to
fit tightly again, feeling quite thick, and
attached to tissue beneath like a young child’s,
so I then realised that it could not form sharp
creases and wrinkles again, for it lay firm

not a single wrinkle has ever returned. Facial
expressions now simply cause my skin to
torm in soft, gently rounding curves, and I
no longer have the least fear of wrinkles.
In a single night, therefore, twenty years ap-
peared to be taken from my age, and naturally
1 was delighted beyond expression.
I next offered my treatment to several of
my intimate friends, who used it with sur-
prising results, and as not a single one failed
to succeed I have now decided to have 500
more ladies try it, with the understanding
that if it proves entirely satisfactorv—not
otherwise—they will write me a confidential
letter to that effect, and agree to recommend

it to their iriends. Then when the treatment
is offered to the public I will have indis-
putable proof that it is practically infallible,
and the method will also be well introduced
by the recommendations of the ladies who
receive it through accepting this introductory
offer.
Mrs. A. Chester, of Belfast, writes: “My
wrinkles have all disappeared and my skin is
smooth and clear. I really cannot speak too
highly in its praise.” Mrs. McVittie, Carlisle,
writes: “The inip rovement is really wonderful.
It does take the wrinkles out so I look

Mrs. 11. Glynn,

POWDERS AND SYRUPS

COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM
PELLETS PROVED THE EFFECTIVE
REMEDY.
“I am only too pleased to tell you what
a splendid remedy for Worms Comstock’s
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets are,” writes Mrs.
C. Fuller, of 40 North Terrace, Hackney.
Adelaide, S.A. “I had occasion some 12
months ago to procure a medicine for my
little, boy, who was much affected by worms.
I tried many powders and syrups which
different chemists recommended me, but they
were of little use, and only checked the
complaint temporarily. I only wished your
remedy had occurred to me sooner, for after
giving the child one packet they completely
eradicated this unpleasant ailment, and for
this remedy I am truly thankful. It is 12
months now since they cured him, and the
worms have not made the slightest reappear-
ance. You may publish this if you desire for
other parents’ information.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal prepara-
tion for the eradication of worms in children
and adults. For sale by all chemists and
storekeepers, price 3s. 6d.. per packet, or

POLITICAL
POINTS
Observing that a proposal to tax bets has
been made in N. S. Wales, Snowball, a ATic-
torian M.L.A., has rushed Peacock with a
similar suggestion for his State. If bets
can be taxed, argues wowserdom, there will
be no need for the dreadful tote, which
“makes gambling legal.” The fact that bet-
ting must be legal to be taxable, and that it
is now legal in the places where the tote
would be “immoral,” does not embarrass the
wowser intelligence. If Snowball’s proposal
is ever carried out, wowserdom will have
assisted the State in a clumsy plan for rais-
ing revenue by “legalised gambling,” with a
distinct injustice to the punter, who will pay
the whole tax through the shortening of the
odds by the bookmaker. With the tote the
tax'would be raised in a neat, just, business-
like manner. Snowball, being a lawyer,
must see that there are really only two hon-
orable things to do —to bring in the tote or
abolish the bookmaker. The fact that it
would be well-nigh impossible to do the lat-
ter, except by also abolishing racecourses or
bringing in the tote, should not blind Snow-
ball’s followers to the rank injustice of the
bet-taxing hypocrisy.
THE DESIRED RESULT.
ANTI-CONSCRIPTIONIST : “But, my dear
fellow, conscription would put us on a
level with those bally German blighters,
what?”
THE OTHER: “Well, there ain’t no points in
being behind them, are there?”
The explanation was quite simple:—
Yes, I know it is bad. But consider my position.
Here we are with a department loaded up with in-
competents whom we are unable to get rid of and
cannot make do their work properly.. The only thing
we can do is to pay them their wages. Their incapacity
is leading to an annual loss of scores of thousands of
pounds. That leak must be stuffed up somehow.
Therefore the public will have to pay more for a pub-
lic service which I know is exasperatingly inefficient
and not worth the extra money.
The manager of a State railway in China?
The deputy sub-director of the national
camel-manure brickworks in Timbuctoo?
Not at all! It is the Postmaster-General

Australial
The usual old row lias arisen in S. Aus.
over the purchase of estates for closer settle-
ment. A select committee has been inquir-
ing into one particular deal and finds that,
though £6 10s. an acre was paid (and of
course borrowed) for it, “the estate is not
one suited for closer settlement, an opinion
which is confirmed not only by the evidence
but by the fact that the land has not been
taken up.” But while this land wasn’t
taken up, the fact that the Government
paid £6 10s. for it is pretty certain to have
stiffened the price demanded for other land,
so that instead of promoting settlement the
wretched State repurchase system actually
retarded it. There is only one way. and it
yields revenue instead of merely debt to the
State. That way is a land-value tax.
THE MAN WHO STAYED AT HOME.
COPENHAGEN, Wednesday.—A giant wooden statue
of Admiral von Tirpitz has been erected at Wilhelms-
haven.
A fine lift is being given to an already
flourishing local industry by the S. Aus.
Parliament. Pub bars are to be closed at
six, as decided by recent referendum. “Can’t
a man have a drink with liis dinner ?” asked
all hotelkeepers and most travellers. “What
about our wine industry?” said the many
interested in it. Thus a compromise was
suggested, and the present popular idea is
that Australian wine may be served at the
meal-fable of a hotel up till eight o’clock,
but, of course, not in the bar.
There has been a mild uproar in S. Aus.
over the decision of the Craw-ford Vaughan
Government to drop the £ per cent, sinking
fimd which Treasurer Holder established
nearly 20 years ago. It really doesn’t mat-
ter very much. The thing has been a fraud
most of the time. A per cent, sinking-
fund, though modest, would be splendid if
the Government left off borrowing. But no
country will ever get out of debt by paying-
off £5O and borrowing £lOO.
Since that sedate printer, Robert MeCut-
cheon, accepted an lion, position in the Vic-
torian Cabinet, Norman Bayles seems to
have lost hope of ever becoming a Minister.
Boyles was one of the 20 Liberal intriguers
who in October shook the then Peacock
Cabinet to its foundations. But when
McCutcheon came out of the corner and
accepted favors from Peacock, the thing put
Bayles quite out of his stride towards an
ornamental position in an ideally-Tory Cab-
inet. Now a sort of resigned irresponsi-
bility marks his demeanor in debate. What
is the good of being affable in one’s best
Toorak manner if the effort is to lead
nowhere —not even to the doubtful honor
of making one in a crowd of honorary Min-
isters?
We are still going on capturing some-
body else’s exports. Imports to Australia
from July to October, 1914, amounted to
£23,756,663; during the same period of this
year to £27,761,085. That represents
£4,004,422 extra pianola and necktie and
flowers for the spring millinery and all the
rest of it. From July to October, 1914,
exports (other than gold) amounted to
£15,517,933; this year, £16,891,003. We
have to export enough to (1) pay for our
imports ; (2) pay interest on our public and
private debt held abroad. But in this period
we didn’t export enough to even pay for
our imports. We were £10,870,082 short.
To square things we borrowed to some
extent. For the rest tve iveakened our
national finances by exporting no less than
£7,593,052 of our accumulated gold. In
tha corresponding period of 1911/ we
exported only £536,591/. There can be only
one end to that sort of thing, and Australia
is being rushed towards it with appalling
speed.
Those farmers who have been raising
a howl about the Commonwealth wheat
scheme —mainly moved to hostility because
it represents a proposal of the Labor
Government, and is therefore, of course, a
kind of relation of the A.W.U. log—are
getting their eyes opened by a study of
freight charges. Wheat freights from the
Argentine to Britain, which used to be
12s. 6d., have advanced to 1055.; and on
the same basis the freights from Australia
would hoyer somewhere about 150 s. In
getting freight at 955. Hughes has done re-
markably well —especially if he has got
■ enough to go round. What would have
happened to cocky if he had been “left
alone,” as some of him asked to be?
The scramble for the Drummoyne seat in
the N. S. Wales Assembly is helping to
show up the innards of the Party machine.
Labor, having no chance, stands aside, and
about a dozen Liberal has-beens a A
struggling for the nomination. At a meeting
the other day a handful of people suddenly
decided to resuscitate the defunct Liberal
League and two hundred names were
handed in for membership. The qualifica-
tion for membership is payment of Is.
Apparently the “election” will not be de-
cided at the ballot-box, but at dead of night
in the Liberal League’s room, and by the
person who can produce enough supporters
at a bob each. Had the local league been
kept alive by a band of enthusiastic workers
in the party cause, there might be some
vague excuse for allowing them to exercise
the unexpected privilege of a party choice.
But what excuse is there for hastily form-
ing a mock-party tribunal composed of par-
tisans hurriedly roped in by various candi-
dates? Far better to let all comers go to
the poll and have an indecent public
scramble, in place of one more indecent if
privately conducted.
“481” ; This struck me as the most pitiful
thing we had to do in the trenches at Anzac.
While waiting for the reinforcements that
the voluntary system never sent us, we had
to march slowly along our firing line, with
fixed bayonets showing above the parapet.
After traversing our section of trench we
had to double round the back in quick time
to repeat the march. So we circled time
after time, the poor little trick being in-
tended to make the enemy think that we
were being strongly reinforced, whereas we
were pitifully few and desperately weak. I
doubt if the object was achieved, for the
Turk is no fool, and probably reasoned that
if we were reinforced it would be secretly,
and certainly not with bayonets showing
above the parapet. And away back at home
—well, yon know best what was going on
away back at home !
“SOME GOOD IN ME, AFTER ALL.”
Only a few weeks ago Mr. Asquith, a lifelong Free-
trader, definitely announced his conversion to Pro-
tection.-The AGE.
There is one blot besides a couple of
smudges on Hughes’s wheat scheme —it gives
no encouragement to Australian manufac-
turing industry. A better-thought-out plan
would have provided a smaller commission
on wheat and a larger one on flour exported.
This would have had the treble advantage
of saving ship space, keeping the needed
offals in the Commonwealth and giving more
work to millers and their employees.
The N. S. Wales politicians having spent
several millions of Cohen’s cash on Yanco
and landed the whole thing in a bog, the
announcement is now made that someone
will have to be imported to put the thing
right. Apparently these politicians reckon
that nobody in Australia can lift a thing
out of the mess in which they are capable
of putting it. And for once this paper be-
lieves they are right. (P.S. —It believes
that the N.S.W. Labor politician is capable
of bogging Cohen’s millions so that no
foreigner can get them out either.)
“W.G.8.”: The A.W.U. nominees lost by
15 votes in their run for municipal honors
at Port Darwin. They are howling now
that the Chow vote beat them, and it seems
to be the fact. This election is the first
under adult franchise. Now what sort of
White Australia rule is it which gives the
balance of power to Chinese —a people who
never have, done any good for the Territory
and never will?
THE FOSTER MOTHER.
There is a widening and thoroughly justified dis-
trust of Parliaments in Australia. The Referendum
with the initiative will restore to the people the
right to govern themselves, will make them supreme
over Parliament instead of allowing Parliament to
be supreme over them. —Sydney TELEGRAPH.
Something really brilliant in the way of
excuses was called for when it was the
other day admitted that the Victorian Coun-
try Roads Board had bought a roller from
the Australian Metal Co. as late as Sep-
tember 80, 1914. An Australian tender
was only £23 over the other, but the Board
preferred to buy from a foreigner, who is no
doubt busy filling good Australians with the
lead which he bought with the proceeds of
similar previous sales. Every week makes
the lesson plainer—nothing but a tariff wall
will stop these bad Australians.
The State Government of the Speck has
£BOO on the estimates to pay for an inquiry
into means of combating syphilis,
For a start it has got Dr. Elking-
ton, Federal Quarantine Officer in
Queensland, formerly Principal
Medical Officer in Tasmania, to put
in a pleasant holiday working up a
report on the subject. As far as
Queensland is concerned Elkington
has pronounced in favor of whole-
hog measures. But maybe he knows
Tasmania well enough to doubt
whether any whole-hoggism would
ever be put into force there, even
if he recommended it.
“F.N.T.”: Little Laurie Cohen,
assistant secretary to the Trades
Hall Council of Victoria, who at a
recent interview with Webster,
P.M.G., threatened “fight if you
want it” and recalled “what hap-
pened to old Spence,” has really
done much less for Labor and has
much less influence than his lan-
guage would indicate. Cohen is a
shoi-t, narrow, clean-shaven person
of uncertain age, with a bushy eye-
brow out of proportion to the rest
of his face. His trade used to be
cutting inscriptions on tombstones.
Various ill-judged utterances have
given him more notoriety than has
fallen to the lot of any Victorian
Labor legislator; but the verbal
antics have done little more than
to embarrass Labor supporters.
Webster put the thing in a nutshell
when he said that Cohen seemed
to consider himself the Labor move-
ment. What Labor must do is to
remove that impression from
Cohen’s mind—not for Cohen’s
good (blow Cohen !), but for the
good of this country, which the thoughtful
Laborite is trying to benefit.
AUSTRALIA’S PRIDE.

NOTIONS
This tax on N. S. Wales bookmakers is
not going' to hurt MaeShortodds; the only people
likely to suffer serious injury belong to the tribe
who keep the game going. Isaac will become more
usurious than ever, and that will be the beginning
and end of the thing. The tax ranges from .£5O on
fielders doing business (and the Gentile) in the
paddock at Randwick to £2O on the St. Leger
rooks and £2O and £lO on operators at suburban
and country meetings. As over 400 books are open
at Randwick and about half that number at subur-
ban' races and pony flutters, it is estimated that the
revenue to be raised by the State from the direct
tax. and the 25 per cent, to be appropriated from
the fees charged by the clubs will be about £lOO,OOO
a year plus whatever the yield may be from the Id.
tax on each betting ticket issued. This Id. ticket
proposition looks a queer thing. The State will
get a penny when someone takes a ready-money bet
of half a crown, but the brown won’t be collected
when someone else nods up a hundred to five-and-
twenty. Someone has been complaining that the
burden of the brown will throw some of the “small
men” out of action. Rubbish ! But if it did make
them work, what reason would there be for squeak-
ing?
The fact is that this tax proposed by Ikey’s good
friend Holman will sidetrack the tote and leave
Judah in possession of the spoils. Ho far as Hol-
man’s windy observations on the subject could lie
understood, Ids objection to the machine has been
that his soul revolted against the State deriving
revenue from “the gambling of the people.” It
looked a flagrantly dishonest pose at all times : and
what can the humbug sav about it now ? Where
is the moral difference between the State raking in
ducats from an Ikey with a loud voice and
sovereigns front a mechanical lkey? Only this —
that the introduction of the totalisator would have
driven a mob of parasites to toil for a living, have
yielded a much greater revenue to the State and
have given the public a fair deal. These bear the
appearance of being points of first consideration.
They have not been so regarded by the Holman
gang. Why ?
“Mujik”: Anyhow, whether the book or
the tote is on tap, the punter deserves nobody’s
sympathy. He is just an idiot and as full of con-
ceit as the Noses are of cheek. Consider him in
general or in particular. In 99 cases out of a
hundred he doesn’t know the first thing about a
horse, to start with. Next, he doesn’t know any-
thing about form. He knows less about riding and
nothing about breeding. He spends laborious hours
plodding through “training notes” which are mostly
meaningless and for the rest misleading. He listens
to the futile chatter percolating through training
stables and barbers’ shops and bars. Then armed
with this vast stock of misinformation and a handful
of quids he rushes out to the course to talk in a
loud, confident tone about every prad on the card
and measure his intelligence against the ring’s and
all the factors which enter into the decision of a
gallop. And because he generally gets on the wrong
'un his mouth is filled with wailing about having
been taken down, or had a cross put on him, or
been on a stumer or something. What an ass lie
is! Backing horses is the most dangerous game in
the world even for a man on the inside running
with a cool and well-informed head. For the rest of
men it is plain madness. I was standing in the
paddock at Riccarton (M.L.) long ago talking to
G. G. Stead and Derrett. Up prances a friend.
“Your horse worth a sovereign in this, Stead?” he
asked. “Well, she is a good filly, and I expect her
to win; but no horse is ever worth backing,” was
the answer. “And what do you think, Bob?” said
the other, addressing Derrett. “I have ridden every
horse that is in this race,” was the reply, “and
my own sovereign stays in my pocket.” Now
Derrett was a rider of long experience and a rare
good judge of form and pace. Stead was as good a
judge and a very wealthy man. And that day his
filly was just snuffed out on the post, and the
punters wagiged their narrow heads with great
solemnity and whispered to one another that she
“wasn’t trying.” Another day a well-known horse-
man was getting ready to climb on his mount for a
steeplechase at Hawkes Bay. “What yer think’s
going to win, George?” asked someone. “Look
here,” he hissed, “do you think that if I knew what
was going to win this race I’d be risking my neck
for a fiver?” But, outside, the crowd of shop-
assistants and hayseeds had everything measured up
to the last stride.
* ' * ♦ *
“Beeritus” : That race at Menangle Park
(N.S.W.) which had to be run twice reminds me.
At Broken Hill some years ago it was discovered
after the Trial Stakes had been won by a mare
named Lady that as the judge had not been in his
box during the race no winner could be declared.
The stewards ordered the race to be re-run and all
bets to stand. McShortodds ■ laid heavily against
Lady in the second try, as the favorite had been
badly left in the first run and pulled up just after
the start. But Lady duly came to light again, and
a great wailing ascended from the camp of Israel.
At the Cock burn meeting soon afterwards the
starter sent the field away from the five-furlong
post in a six-furlong race. The mistake was not
discovered until the tote had commenced paying out
on Speed On, when someone drew attention to the
official time, lmin. ssoc. Thereupon the tote was
closed with a bang- and the race re-run. As Speed
On did not arrive in time oil the second go the
mistake cost the club a lot of good coin and
language. The first steeple ever run at Broken Hill,
by the way, hasn’t been finished yet, and it started
25 years ago. Neither of the only two horses that
entered could or would climb over the obstacles.
The turf commissioner, rather dull in the
ears, met a punter friend the other day. “And
what’s doing on the rails?” he asked with cordial
interest. “Doing!” cried the other; “why, I’m"
right on the rocks. How about a caser?” He was
directed to try the opposite ear, and when he got
there the inquiry was lifted to a quid. “Better get
back to the five-bob side,” counselled the listener, as
he started to feel for some silver.
Sydney horse-owners who are urging the
suburban clubs to put a hurdle-race on every pro-
gramme have a good case. At present these clubs
only provide a jumping race each month from April
to September, an arrangement which results in a
hurdler usually becoming a horribly expensive
animal. Yet the class of horse that can be put over
fences is worth consideration for many reasons, and
where the competition in these events is anything
like good the public finds the race with obstacles in
it considerably more interesting than flutters over
five and six furlongs. In Victoria and Maoriland
hurdling- is on a much higher level than in N. S.
Wales merely because this branch of the game is
reasonably provided for. Around Sydney it is
treated as something scarcely worth bothering about.
How does this stand for a place
in racing records? At the recent Bowen (Q.)
meeting all five events on the card were appro-
priated by the prads of A. W. H. Cunningham, and
Powell was on top of each winner.

-“Merrigal”: “Belar’s” 114 miles from
sun-come to sun-go takes some beating, but —well,
here’s mine. Two once-well-known N.S.W. western
sports, Bill Frost and Ted Terence, matched their
respective hacks, Colonel and Barmaid, for £5O
aside, with the starting- post at Dubbo and the
judge’s box at Orange, a distance of 96 miles hv
the ancient Cobb and Co.’s route. They left Dubbo
at 6 a.m\, and Colonel made the pace so lively that
the mare had had enough some, miles short of the
destination. The other showed off her paces in
Orange sufficiently early to admit of a feed and rub
over before 6 p.m.
FRANCIS TURTLES and his travelling
companion, Wowser.
The cup of bitterness was swigged to its
depths by Charlie Simpson at Melbourne Stadium
on Saturday night, when, after nine successive wins,
he had to hand over the Vic. featherweight title to
Bert Spargo. It was a clean, fast scrap, without a
single clinch from box-on to the last trump, bull-
headed fighting- cum insatiability going- under to
boxing plus hard hitting plus the art of pushing off
elsewhere when trouble loomed. As he had only
won their previous encounter by the skin of his
teeth, Simpson decided to chance nothing, and in
the opening skirmishes laid it on thick, causing
Sparg-o much uneasiness of mind. Then Albert
unearthed a new brand of bother, in triplicate—a
straight left to the basement, a sudden left jab to the
top-storey and a vigorous right clout just under the
roof. The continuous application of this wallop
would have satisfied any ordinary pug, but Simpson,
mostly rubber and reinforced concrete, just licked his
lips and bogged in harder than ever. The fifteenth
round brought on high fever in the crowd as the
two lads became almost' undistinguishable in a willy-
willy of whirling arms, glistening pelts and dust.
Thence to the end the pleasantries continued with
even greater gusto than in the first half, Simpson
fighting as strongly as ever, but out-boxed by his
more scientific friend. A few finaAcially-interested
strafed when the referee anointed Spargo, hut tin-
crowd threw its hat in the air and disported itself
generally like a Chinese New Year.
* * * *
When Herb McCoy and Fred Delaney
not into the i ing at Sydney Stadium on Saturday
McCoy found himself up against a stiff proposition,
for the Englishman cut loose and insisted upon
fight. Before the first round was over he had shown
himself a very rugged customer indeed, as willing
to take punishment as anxious to give it. It too'k
McCoy a long while to find out the weak place in
the newcomer’s armor, and meantime lie was badly
handled and narrowly escaped the knock that counts.
But when he discovered that Delaney’s defence
against the left used- in clinches was painfully weak,
McCoy worked the infighting - for all it was worth
and gave the other fellow a bad time. It was- a.
hard, gruelling scrap all the way through, in which
McCoy fought with courage, endurance and judg-
ment against a rough, heavier opponent who
crowded in on him with tireless resolution. It
was McCoy's best performance so far, and yet he
would not have won had Delaney brought his brains
out with him and applied them to the simple job
of blocking the sinister glove which reached his
jaw nearly every time the two hung together. As
it was McCoy won well. His hitting was cleaner,
his timing better, his defence smarter, his general-
ship far the best.
Tlie fierce argument about the relative
merits of Messrs. McGoorty and Darcy will be
carried a stage further on Boxing Day, when the
twain will meet at the old address for purposes of
biff. And when tlie disturbance is over the argu-
ment will rage with greater fury than ever, and the
dying year will be drowned in the howls of bar-
rackers who have lost a couple of bob. Meantime
the writer of this paragraph won’t lose tuppence,
and that's what he thinks of it.
Introduced at Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day, “Knock-out” Brown, of Chicago, Fred Gilmour,
of ’Murka, and Blew Edwards, featherweight cham-
pion of England. Edwards, a fair, mild-looking-
youngster, meets Jimmy Hill on Saturday. Brown,
a stockily-built, hard-featured smiter, will bring his
bashfulness to bear on Darcy in tlie middle of next
month. Gilmour is to interview Tommy Uren.
“Yan”: In khaki and full of pothouse
valor lie swaggered . into the tramway waiting-shed
at 2 a.m. Mistaking a withered old man for a Turk
he challenged him to mortal combat, and when the
ancient declined the invitation the air was filled with
words of burning reproach for all persons with cold
feet. The only human being about was snoring
loudly in a corner, but being' roused by the uproar
staggered to bis feet and walking over to the blas-
phemer confidentially asked: “Is it you that wants
to fight?” “Yes, I do,” wildly assented the chal-
lenger of old men. “Oh! Well, just stop this,”
the other advised, and a hand as hard as a piece of
road-metal fell on a militant nose like, the crack of
doom. “Perhaps a cove’ll be able to get a bit o’
peace and quiet now,” reflected the disturbed sleeper,
as lie went back to liis corner and instantly started
playing the bugle again, while the withered old man
applied first aid and the Midnight Patrol wondered
what lie had struck. It happened to be the remains
of a once-famous featherweight, now chunky and fat
and a grandfather, and on his way home from work.
How about heavyweights getting a job as
ballet dancers? Up at Glen Innes (N.S.W.) the
other day there was a high-kicking match between
•I. 11. Penrose (Gunnedah), 6ft. and 17st. 101 b., and
F. O’Donnell (a local man), 6ft. 4in. and 17st. lib..
After a strenuous contest Penrose lifted his hoof
7ft. 4in., an inch higher than the other chap could
manage. Incidentally, the pair booted £4O into the
war chest, and more will probably follow as
O’Donnell is being pursued by multitudinous chal-
lenges, and long, lean leapers are frantically search-
ing for records.

After tlie big charity match at Melbourne
during the plum-pudding season Cricketer Macartney
will take off his pads and get into khaki. Since
Mac. put up 177, when 15 years of age, in a match
at North Sydney he has gone on amassing runs at
a rate almost _ amazing. For the 14 test matches
lie has played in against England his average stands
at 26.39.- Good luck to him with gun and bomb !
He is easily one of Australia’s best.
Wicketkeepers made the bright spots in
Sydney grade cricket on Saturday. Carter (Waver-
ley v. Sydney) never sacrificed a run (the only
sundries being five leg-byes in a total of 208), and
stumped and caught one. Shirley (Petersham v.
Middle Harbor) and Ratcliffe (.Bahrain v, Redferh)
each stumped three and caught one: Another cheery
effort was put together ’by Taylor (Glebe), whose
safe bands gathered four catches.

There was some tall smiting in Moore
Park (Sydney) cricket on Saturday, when, in about
four hours, a club (Dailey) smacked together 472
runs, of which Storey banged 245.

“Nyren”: Re “Jackar’s” par. (B.
9/12/’l5) about, the late W. G. Grace. It looks as
if the disturbance between Grace and W. Bruce,
president of tlie Bendigo United Cricket Club, which
Occurred during the match against 22 of Sandhurst
at Sandhurst, has been given a modern setting. Here
are the facts of that business, from the Bendigo
Advertiser : “At the luncheon Mr. Grace did not
make Iris appearance, and Mr. Bruce, who presided,
gave his surprise at such a seeming act
of discourtesy, , After luncheon Mr. Grace returned,
and seeking ait interview with Mr. Bruce, asked him
to publicly-; apologise for his remarks. Mr. Bruce
declined to do so, whereupon Mr. Grace threatened
to'wring an apology out of him, and he was desired
by Mr. Bruce to commence at ofice. Nothing further
took place until tlie conclusigu of play, when in' the
dressing-room Mr. Bruce went, to Mr. Grace, and in
a frank manner stated that if Mr. Grace considered
anything he had said required an apology he was
perfectly willing to apologise. Instead of accepting
this in the friendly-spirit in which ft appeared to
be offered, Mr. Grace turned round and said: ‘You
acted in a d —d ungentlemanly way.’ To which
Mr. Bruce responded: ‘lf you say: so, you are a
d- —d blackguard.’ Mr. Grace made .a motion with
his clenched fist to strike Mr..JM'uce, but several
of the bystanders interfered, sSyhigC that he was
wrong, and that he ought to have’ accepted Mr.
Bruce’s apology.”

“Adelaide”: “J.D.” reproves me (B.
9/12/’l5) on two test-match points,, and he is right
on both, once obviously and the other time on
statistics. Of course, 1878, date of the Australians’
first visit to England, was not “over” 20 years
after anything in the ’6o’s; blame the writer —or
possibly the printer. On the 1882 test-match team
(which was merely called “young,” and not “kids”),
“J.D.’s” sledgehammer method of producing - birth-
certificates all round shows them a fair average. But
figures will prove anything. The five men of 30 or
over pull up the average. The original words, “a
young English team being skittled out by Boyle
and Spoffortli after \\ r . G. seemed to have the game
won,” seem to put the case fairly enough. I had
the four Cambridge men in mind, all fine bats. Two
of them were still undergraduates, I fancy—a very
rare thing in test matches. I can still ‘see Lucas
and Lyttelton just keeping their wickets up when
(as Maurice Read put it in Australia later) a couple
of vigorous strokes would have settled the matter.
Steel and C. T. Studd were the others, and any of
our men will tell you that at least one of those'two
had to be dosed with brandy by his captain before
going in—to fail at the pinch. . It was youthfulness
that lost England the match.
“K.Q.” : “Will G. Buck’s” par. concerning
Australian beaches (B. 2/12/’l5) incites me to ad-
dress the meeting about the edge of Stockton
(N.S.AV.). It is not a. registered, racecourse, but
many a horse and bicycle race is run there, all tlie
same, as the sand is unbroken along the whole stretch
of 25 miles to Port Stephens. Owing to a breakwater
the deadly undertow is unknown for several miles.
Therefore I nominate Stockton as the safest beach
for surfing in Australia. From a point about three
miles from Stockton there are “holes” teeming with
black bream, and lying between the sand dunes and
the ti-tree scrub, at about a quarter of a mile from
the edge of the Pacific, are a chain of fresh-water
lagoons, which provide other sport in moderation.
“Verdad”: Does anyone know how the
average sea temperature off the Australian East
-Coast compares with the average air temperature.
The current that' flows southwards down the coast
continues on its course until it reaches Antarctic
regions, then turns east till it reaches South
America, when part of it turns up the West Coast
of that continent. By this time the _ current is
ice-cold, and remains extraordinarily frigid right up
into the tropics. It then turns west, and by the
time it reaches Australia is well wanned up, so
that its temperature is probably higher than the air
temperature here. It is this current that makes
surf-bathing the. popular sport in Sydney. On the
coast of Chile, even as far north as Antofagasta and
Arica, in the tropics, the water, on the other hand,
is so cold that bathing- is almost impossible, except
in a few sheltered places where the configuration of
the country diverts the current and allows the
water to remain stationary long enough to get the
chill off.
G-. Hansel, the Ma State champion
sprinter, was in fine form at East Sydney on Satur-
day, winning 100yds. (10 4-ssec.) and 220yds.
(24lsec.), second in hop, step and jump, and third
in broad jump. Another effort worth enthusiasm
was put up by a St. Joseph's College schoolboy,
J. B. Ryan, who won throwing the discus and put-
ting 121 b. shot, and finished third with the javelin.
Both are young Australians, and likely to make a
name in future championships.

Sydney baseball on Saturday was the
real thing-. In all three first-grade matches there
was only a point between the teams —a record never
excelled. The surprise was the uprising of St.
George against Waver ley, and the tog-doggers just
squeezed out by seven runs to six. It was Waver-
ley’s closest call of the season. From the rapidly-
growing- army of barrackers at 'ball it looks as if
the new game suits the appetite. In fact, it is the
only live sporting sideshow in Sydney this season.
The season’s championship of the Sydney
Flying Squadron was decided on Saturday in a
healthy nor’easter. The heavy puffs suited the hard
weather boats, and the result was left to that por-
tion of the fleet which loves a blow. Kismet, with
everything turned up for the conditions, danced
home in front. Many of the others never saw her
after the first round. The 18-foot championship lays
itself open to serious criticism in so much as the
winning- of it depends on the whims of the weather.
A more rational way of deciding the event would he
on points spread out over a series of races. Some-
thing of the kind Would have been done long ago if
it hadn’t been feared that it would knock the
bottom out of the season’s handicap programme.

Victorian road champion E. Tamme con-
tines to plug along the pathway that leads to cycling-
glory and varicose veins. Recently he won Vic-
torian Cyclists’ Union 25-mile championship in
68min. lOsjbc.—--which taking the roads into consid-
eration was a- great l-islc of life. In a dozen starts
this season, Tamme has gathered eight “fastest” and
four “place” prizes, and is probably enjoying him-
self immensely.
W. It. George, “father of cycling” in X.
S. Wales, heard the last bell on Saturday at 83.
ITis enthusiasm for the sport dates from 1879, when
a hike like the hind wheel of a buggy was known as
a velocipede and cycling- was as dangerous as high-
diving. He. founded the first bicycle club in N., S.
Wales over 40 years ago, • when everyone was an
amateur, and he keenly protested against the irrup-
tion of professionalism which followed the invention
of the pneumatic tyre. George was nominally patron
of his old club to the very end, blit the limitations
set by advancing years prohibited him from taking
an active part in the sport.

There are 30.000 motor-car drivers on
service at the British Front in France, carrying-
supplies and ammunition. This does not include
hospital corps, ambulances, armored cars, etc., but

of that' part of the big- job.

Three Australian motor-car performances
stand out bv themselves—Murray Aunger’s Mel-
bourne-to-Adelaide (594 miles) drive, 14hrs. 54min. :
A. V. Turner’s Melbourne-to-Sydney (565 miles)
run, 19hrs! 2min. ; and the recent Fremantle:Sydney
record via Adelaide and Melbourne (2899 miles),
eight days 23hrs. 40min., by Armstrong-, Fraser and
party. From a speed point of view good judges give
first place to Aunger’s record, but from a mechani-
cal point of view—that is, as a test of steel and
tyres—the long- Fremantle-Sydnev run takes the
rock-cake. For motor-cycles, the finest performance
yet recorded is J. Bolger’s 23hrs. 41min. from Mel-
bourne to Sydney, put up in competition for a gold
watch given by the Dunlop people to the first
motor-cyclist to get from Sydney to Melbourne in- a
day.

“Didger” Waley. who has presented a
motor-car to the A.M.C. and enlisted as . a driver, is
the last of the 1912 crew that won the Challenge
Vase at Henley to enlist for active service. His size
precluded him from joining the infantry. He steered
the Sydney University to victory in the years
1907- when they did the hat-trick and put up a
record. Also, he steered the 'N.S.W. crews in the
inter-State races of 1908-9-10-11-13. They won in
1908- and on the first occasion named Ma’s
crew got home ahead of the other States after having-
failed to do so for 15 years. Among- Waley’s other
associations with winning- crews was when he steered
the champion eight N.S.W., 1908, and the Aus-
tralian Olympic International Crews at Henley and
Stockholm in 1912, when they brought the Henley
Challenge A'ase to Australia. He has always been
able to cox a crew weighing under Bst. 121 b., and,
although now settled down and the father of a
family, he weighs no more than he did in those days.

by IV. Webb for the Ricketty Isles championship)
and “Billy” Fogwell (N.S.W.). The tussle is listed

THE BOOKIE AND THE SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some gentle bookies full of quids—
For favorites had all “gone down” —
Well-dined, amusement-seeking Yids,
Each parting with his half a crown,
One night turned in to have their fill
Of what they all termed “vordervill.”
The show was going well and strong,
Until a vocalist appeared
To sing a new recruiting song,
And then the rude Olympians jeered.
Not at tlie sentiment —oh, no !
The singer’s voice annoyed them so.
All through the first verse was he guyed,
That hapless warbler of the war;
He stood it, and the gods defied,
Unmusically calling for
Recruits to end the Teuton bane.
Shirkers were present, that was plain.
lie started on the second verse.
“Don’t sing,” one cried. “We will be good!”
The noise in front got worse and worse;
The singer stopped, in silence stood ;
And then a bookie yelled : “Don’t fuss
About it, Sonny. Owe it us!”

Remarkable Motor Record
FREMANTLE TO SYDNEY in 8 Days 23 Hrs. 40 Mins.
GREAT TYRE TEST!
The finest transcontinental Motor Car drive yet accomplished in Australia,
is that just recorded by Messrs. P. Armstrong, H. Fraser and T. Collins,
who left Fremantle on 10th November, and reached Sydney (2899
miles) on 19th November, The Records of the Trip are as follows:
Fremantle to Adelaide (1763 miles) 5 days hrs., Fremantle to
Melbourne (2334 miles) 7 days 11 'A hrs., Fremantle to Sydney (2899 miles)
8 days 23 hrs. 40 min. Such a performance is as astounding as it is remark-
able for the demonst ation of tyre service given. In fitting Australian-made
DUNLOPTYRES
for this strenuous journey, a wise selection was made. It was a gruelling
test for car and tyres, and the latter in particular. Through rough bush
country, over rocks, sand, stumps and ruts, the “ Dunlops ” were dread-
fully abused for nearly 3000 miles, but “ Dunlop ” quality and workmanship
stood the test. That is one of the finest features of these Australian
made tyres—the strength to stand up to continuous hard work ; they are
unrivalled in this respect, hence their popularity with Australasian
motorists. Our claim, “Use‘Dunlops’—it pays,” has again been
publicly vindicated, and in no uncertain manner. When such tyres are
obtainable why buy imported goods? OBTAINABLE ALL GARAGES.

Dead in England, Stephen Phillips, after
Yeats the finest weaver of verse discovered
in the British Islands for a generation.
Phillips was a grandson of Wordsworth, and
tried to make a living in a good many ways
before taking to poetry as a habit. He
tried acting with indifferent results, and
army tutoring brought him bread-and-butter
when he could eat it for the nausea the occu-
pation produced. A small income of the
unearned sort enabled him to chuck cram-
ming-, and he settled down to make words
rhyme and lines scan. He didn’t, for all his
literary success, draw heavily on the purse
of Bull; but then he didn’t write the sort
of stuff Bull really feeds on. A Tennyson
who can be national and popular, and still
at times show himself a rare artist, doesn’t
come along every day.

A NERVE TONIC.
Iu many severe nervous disorders the best
remedy .is often a tonic. The most active
tonic treatment is recommended by the high-
est medical authority to arrest the progress
of such diseases.
It is impossible to reach the nerves
directly with medicine. Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills are a nervine tonic, but they act on
ilie nerves through the blood, enabling the
blood to carry to the nerves the elements
needed to build them up.
Neuralgia, sciatica, sick headache and a
number cl’ more severe nervous troubles are
propertly treated by building up the blood
with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills and are often
entirely corrected in this way.
If your are nervous you can help yourself
by refusing to worry, by taking proper rest,
sleep and vacations, by avoiding excesses and
by taking out-of-door exercise. For medi-
cine take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, the non-
alcoholic tonic.
Sufferers from nervous disorders who have
been taking treatment without benefit should
investigate the tonic method. Write to-day
to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney,
for the booklet, “Diseases of the Nervous
System.” It will be sent free on request.
Your own chemist sells Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, or they will be sent by mail on re-
ceipt of price, -s. 9d. per box, six boxes
15s. 3d. — Advt.
Constipation or Comfort?
There can be neither comfort nor good
health where constipation exists. Most
people suffer from this cause at intervals;
many are chronic victims.
The mistake many people make in treating
this complaint is in adhering to the old-
time nauseating doses of some powerful pur-
gative that leaves the condition worse than
before. In the new laxative. Pinkettes, is
presented a dainty sugar-coated oval that is
free from unpleasant effects, does not upset
the stomach nor gripe, but simply gives
nature the - needed assistance. You can get
a free trial sample by mentioning The
Bulletin and applying to the Dr. Williams
Medicine Co., Svdney; or any dealer will
sell you a full-sized bottle for Is.—Advt.

SHOES are exquisitely cool and light in the
hottest weather, yet none of your dowdy,
canvas shoes either but smart, elegant, in
the fore-front of fashion. Most Australian
women will have sighed for such shoes, and here
they are in the latest shipment of Bostocks. The
model illustrated is delightful even in picture
form. But think of it in reality, a light, grace-
ful shoe of finest moire, built in that new, short-
fronted shape so thoroughly French, and made
with a dainty Louis heel. If ever there was
an ideal shoe for smart wear in hot weather, it
is certainly this one. Then for other tastes,
there are other shoes equally charming in this
Bostock selection. The shoes are unmistakable,
and have the name Bostock stamped on the soles.

“Ivaniva”: “Stargazer” on “Paul .Tones”
(B. 11/11/’l5) mentions Fanny Liddiard,
Suazelle, Geo. Leitch and Johnny Gourlay.
This was the second production, in Novem-
ber, 1890, the first being in March, 1890,
when Marian Burton, with the glorious
voice and physique, played the name part.
There have been four Pauls —Marian Bur-
ton, Fanny Liddiard, Nellie Stewart and
Florence Young. Of these the first and last
come in that order of merit. “Stargazer”
makes a curious error when he calls Gour-
lay a sprightly little American. He was a
Scot. I saw his first performance in Mel-
bourne, in 1866, when he appeared with his
father (John Gourlay) and mother (Susan
Goddard) at L. L. Smith’s Polytechnic Hall.
Bourke-street, in “Mrs. McGregor’s Levee.”
Young Johnny’s next visit to Melbourne was
in 1877, when he came with Salsbury’s
Troubadours.
“First Old Man”: Somebody mentions
“Jim the Penman” in connection with the
recently-deceased mummer Willard. I was
present at the first performance of Sir
Charles Young’s play at the London Hay-
market, when poor Arthur Dacre appeared
in the title-part. It was one of the best
things Dacre ever did; but Willard, of
course, was the better actor. “Jim” was
only put up for a matinee originally —a trial
trip. Amazing that such a good drama,
with so many excellent parts in it, should
have been hawked—all over London and
funked by nearly every manager. The Hay-
market was doing pretty badly when Young’s
piece came along. Two estimable men—
Bussell and Bashford —had been running
the place, at a loss, for several months. 11.
A. Jones had just weighed in with a frost
called “Plaid Hit,” which aptly described
the condition of things. “The Penman”
changed all that. Its success was imme-
diate. It was put in the evening bill as
soon as possible. Some of the members of
the matinee cast had engagements under
other managements at night. Their parts
had to be given to different mummers. Thus
Beerbolim Tree had the reversion of Baron
Ilarfeld, originally taken by “Mons” Marius,
who came to Australia with Mrs. Beere. As
played by Marius the Baron was a French
character, naturally. Tree Potaslied and
Perlmuttercd it, also naturally, Tree being
of German-Jew extraction. When he man-
aged the Hay market subsequently (“Jim the
Penman” having made so much money)
“drawing-room melodrama” was his specialty.
Hence Iladdon Chambers’s “Captain Swift.”
“C. Orkney”: Threatened authors live
long. Here’s our old friend Hall Caine
popping up again in London as though he
had never b- n warned. He has just per-
petrated a new play for the Frohman man-
agement, “The Prime Minister.” Not con-
tent with that, his “Christian” and “Pro-
digal Son” have just been revived at the
Lyric and Aldwych respectively. Nothing
further need be said to prove how difficult
it must be to get good English plays in
England at present.
J.C.W., Ltd., has in hand “Baby Mine,”
though it is held up until the cast can be
favorably filled. The thing, of course, comes
from U.S.A., where it made a stir. Some
critics called it a great play. Others de-
clared it positively indecent. The publie
went to Daly’s to judge for itself, and kept
on going for nearly two years. The central
figures are a young married couple, of won-
derful simplicity.
“Kaniva”: An old property man named
George Ward celebrated his 90th birthday at
Dunedin (M.L.) recently. He was pro-
perty master for the late Sir Wm. and Lady
Don, whose famous theatrical career in
Australia commenced at the Theatre Royal
(Melb.) in January, ’6l. Don died in
Hobart, and the Lady finished a brilliant
career by passing out in London in shock-
ing poverty. George Ward’s brother Charlie,
one time a well-known clown, was property
master to the late W. S. Lyster, who in ’6l
brought the first fully equipped opera com-
pany to Melbourne.
“Stargazer” : There is a great danger of
the repertory play descending into sheer
stupidity, as a result of the repertory play-
maker’s determination to be natural at all
costs. Elizabeth’ Baker’s “The Price of
Thomas Scott,” played by McMahon’s ama-
teurs, is natural, the people are natural,
the situations are natural; but the play is
uncommonly dull, and its moral —so far as
a. moral is discoverable —is that there is
splendor in a cowardly reverence for the
religious convictions of an old linen-draper
whose intellect is hardly emerging from the
cabbage stage. People who like plays of the
calibre of “The Price of Thomas Scott” are
recommended to visit local morgues and
police courts. They will find the real-life
incidents staged at the City Court and at
coronial inquiries absolutely natural, and
just as devoid of the strain of literary grace
as this particular repertory play is, while
the acting is much more “natural” and the
plots are far more diverting.
Rosemary Rees, the Maorilaud playwright,
was lately appearing in England in a one-
acter of her own, “Will You Walk Into My
Parlor?” The playlet, which had already
won her royalties in the fried-nigger repub-
lic, was' pht on as a curtain-raiser to 11. A.
Yachell’s highly-successful “Searchlights.”
GOOD, BETTER, BEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. , after a long and useiul, if not con-
spicuous, career, as an actor, is leaving the stage
for good. —Daily paper.
Of all the actors I have known
A full three-quarters could
At any time have packed and flown,
And left the stage for good.
And that is why I never grieve
When pros, decide to rest,
Remembering that when they leave
They’re acting for the best.
’Tis good to pass; but better ’twere
Had they but heard the call
Some years ago, and best if ne’er
They’d trod the stage at all.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. So
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Thirty yrs It.: Surely there is no cause
to growl now? The print has been twice enlarged
during the past 10 years. But we simply can’t get
the AVild Cat tables in big type. .. .Hak: M.L. mort-
gagees can’t “insist” on mortgagees’ Indemnity
policies. The fact simply is that their security is
jeopardised by the employers’ liability law, and for
a very trifling premium the State and other offices
issue an indemnity policy. .. .Paddymelon: AAe’ve got
room for anybody who knows more about anything
than the rest of us. But we haven’t got room for
talk about coke-making from a man who proposed
to take southern coal up to Cliillagoe and coke it
there... .Aramnlio: Well, send the romance about
casein, not a dry, marrowless bone. .. .Samuels: No;
Roumania took no part against Turkey, in the recent
Balkan war. Her only move was against Bulgaria
after the fight with the Turk had come to an end.
... . A.M.C.: Far too rough and not very original....
G.G. (Melb.) : The hash-tower suffers from loose joints
and is a bit steep. Keep going. . . .Fram: Unsuitable.
No plain liars to-day Fothie: It's
very proud, but shaky on its legs. .. . J. 5.11.: A
literary cobweb. .. .Anabasis: Now shrieking some-
where in the abyss. .. . J.A.O’D,: Brisk jingle only.
Too cheap B. (S.A.) : Revenge story very green
literature. . . .John R.: You and the basket can figbt
it out between you. (P.S. —AVe will back the
basket).... .G.F.A.: Not interesting' as you have
served it up. .. . L.C.C.: Ilate to disoblige you, but
it isn't good enough. Send her a box of, chocolates.
If she is a girl of sense and discernment she will like
them better. . . .H.D.: It takes you a long time to
arrive at your impossible joke. .. . Bellerive: Your
AVild Cat poem :
.. . . G.R.H. : Promising, but on the feeble side. The
ass is too much of an ass. .. . Pegaway P.: You don t.
puncture Ford brilliantly.... G. Bennet: Both brands
unsuitable R.D.AV.: The song-words have not the
quality of good verse. . ..T.E.R. (Canada): Its been
better done before. .. .Lilian II.: Not the bird -the
basket P.R.J.: Tobacco has inspired some fine
things, and you are not strong enough to compete.
....York: No good to us. Don’t waste postage on
the other hundredweight. . . .Ali II.: Thanks for the
advice about tarts with hot-colored hair. . . .W.0’8.:
They’re only in the honorable-mention class....
K.C.M.: Received with loud yawns. You can’t im-
prove our minds to-day. ■ • .T.H.: We made that
recommendation for your protection and our con-
venience. The note may become separated from the
unsigned MS., but the MS. can never become separ-
ated from itself. We hate to have orphaned poems
on our hands Bertie B.: A trifle frowsy, don’t you
think?. . . .Will F.: It misses. .. . J.R.O. (M.L.) :
Sorry —all is over. .. . J.McC.: Let it f10p.... II-
Spall: Sufficiently dull -to ensure rejection
W.J.S.: Reciprocated.... Fragile: The B. has no
use for mere curses at the German. Its pieseut job
is rather to curse a few British and the ,\v icked
ideas with which they have inoculated Australia.
. ...0.G.A.: As between the two, Grahame’s plan is
the more sensible. He evidently knows that it is
simply impossible to stop trafficking in wheat 01,
anvwav, wheat certificates. Why, already in the
country there is the start of a trade in i ig'hts.
That is- to say, the storekeeper is offering the farmer,
cash for his right to something more than the 2s. Bd.
per bushel he can draw on delivery. That is one
reason why the State should part up every penny it
safely can at the first pay.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORR MS PON DENTS.
P. Linn: You took on an enormous contract. Don’t
think it would have a chance elsewhere.... Lois I.:
No use to us Baritone: Don’t recommend that or
any other correspondence school to teach that art.
.. . .Cecil D.: Don’t send us any more tin people. .. .
K.F.: If ever you see a small boy like the one you
have drawn, climb a tree.... Ernest J. B.: Horrible
diagram MLR. (S.A.) : Did you design tapestries
in the Dark Ages? E.R.F.: The management of
Paradise would certainly sue us for libel if we pub-
lished your Peter. Bad egg joke intolerable
More work waiting for Australia when it
gets sense
Typewriter platens (the big rubber-covered rollers),
are dutiable at 35 per cent, plus 10 per cent, of
value. When the complete typewriter comes in the
duty is 10 per cent. That is what the man who
repairs and rebuilds typewriters, and thus becomes a
mechanic, is up against. The present duty on
platens is simply a device for collecting revenue.
With that duty on I can land them far cheaper than
I can get anyone to quote for making the. rubber
covers here. Any maker of rubber goods in Aus-
tralia can turn out the covers with a little practice,
but the grinding of the rubber, to its proper
diameter is skilled work and requires a special
grinding lathe which must be very accurate. Now,
I am a skilled man at platen grinding, and would be
willing to import the special tools necessary, (I
am compelled to import these, as there are only two
makers of grinders in the world, one in U.S.A. and
one in Germany.) If the tariff was, say, 1 5 per
cent, or 100 per cent. I guarantee Australia could
collar the whole of this business in no time, and,
what’s more, the price would not for a start be
more than 10 per cent, above what the imported
article now costs, with every chance of a gradual
reduction as the business grew. And the quality
certainly ought to be better, because there are few
worse things to drag across the world than ground
rubber.
•Tabez Wriglit, who brought a lot of its
native grit from Broken Hill to N.S.W.
Assembly, knocks nails into the party coffin
nightly. He is too downright to advocate a
thing he does not believe in, so he heaves
chunks of truthful disapproval at many of
the acts of the Holman Government. Then
he says: “As a loyal party man, however,
I will, of course, vote with the Government.”
And so he advertises the immoralities of a
degraded system of government which re-
quires him to violate his principles contin-
ually.
RECOLLECTIONS OF A PROSPECTING FAILURE

AVe shouldered our swags
And to Woodspoint we went,
Upon the banks of a river

AVhere we labored and lived
Upon damper tough
But struck no gold

As Shakespeare would hive said:
“ Which tyres to fit, that is the question ;
44 Whether 'tis better on the road to suffer
41 The bursts and punctures of outrageous tyres ,
44 Or to take arms against a sea rf troubles,
44 And, fitting Michelins , end them,"
It is undoubtedly to the motorist’s advantage to fit
Michelin Tyres,
for Michelin’s experience in the manufacture of pneumatic tyres f_r
automobiles is greater than that of any other manufacturer.
The result of this experience is that Michelin is now able to offer
Australian motorists a tyre which will give satisfactory results even under
the most arduous conditions, and whose quality has never been so good
as it is at present.
Our ambition is to manufacture the best
tyre in the world, and all our efforts are
directed to this end*
We confidently assert that the Michelin Tyre is the cheapest tyre
per mile run, and if you are not a user of our tyres we ask you to try
them and prove the truth of this statement.
Our policy, as always, is
One Quality Only, The B:st
Michelin Tyres and Accessories can be
obtained from all the Leading Garages.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).

lom O’Sullivan, Queensland’s prize lucky
politician, is again the darling of the fickle
goddess. O’Sullivan entered the Leg. Coun-
cil in 1903, became one of Arthur Morgan’s
Ministers almost immediately, and only once
in a lengthy Cabinet career represented a
constituency (Warwick) for a brief spell of
about two years. To-day the Labor Gov-
ernment has placed him on the District
Court Bench by way of softening his fall if
the Council should be abolished, as appears
very probable. In O’Sullivan’s Parliamen-
tary career of some dozen years he never
once got dirty and dusty in battle, and never
once made an enemy. This was doubtless by
way of atonement for the career of his
father, the famous and pugnacious Paddy, to
whom enemies were a daily diet and fight the
very breath of his nostrils.

IN BANANA LAND
“Viking”: A wounded soldier had been
invited to the forthcoming meeting, and the
matter was mentioned at a meeting of the
Progress Association. “Is he an orator?”
asked a member. “No. He’s a private,”
explained the chairman.
Johnny Haw : Of the Light Horse camp
at Chermside “Pag” remarked (B.
18/11/’Lj) : “Meals are still dirtily pre-
pared in antediluvian ovens, or any old
thing.” In a recent Arnold Bennett article,
written when that cheerful author was in
the North of Prance on the pressmen’s
famous tour of the lines, absolutely the only
criticism offered of British methods was one
relating to the cooking of meat. Bennett
stated that there was an amazingly plentiful
supply ; but there was no scientific cooking,
and the waste was awful. Isn’t it nearly
time we left off copying the methods of the
most notoriously wasteful army in the
world ?
Concerning a bad smell :
hen someone whispered in the Law's ear “Black-
lock,” the Bananaland Criminal Investigation Dept.,
which had been sniffing aimlessly round the “Xylite”
case, suddenly lifted up its nose and dashed off
along a trail which soon got hot. In fact, it got
red-hot. Xylite, really Zvlite (Royal Artillery—
Xantippe), was a black animal with a white star,
bred by the Thompsons in 1911 at Rylstone (N.S.W.),
and owned by Hebden, a well-known Sydney sports-
man, who died about three months ago.. The horse
had injured one of his legs, and after being turned
out from June to September, was sold at auc-
tion for £25 by Chisholm and Co. on September 6.
Three days later he was sold privately through the
same firm for £3O to a person who called himself
“Jones,” and alleged he was “acting for a Mrs.
Cleary.” For about another week Xylite remained
in a stable at Darlinghurst; then he disappeared into
space for a while, but on the 24th an animal called
Xylite was unloaded from a steamer at Brisbane, and
on October 9, wearing a well-trained look, he
started in the Fourth Division Handicap at Albion
Park, and won with ridiculous ease. About £lOOO was
lifted from Ikey by “a 3’oung lady in black,” who at
once stepped into a motor and left the course. But
before the smell of the petrol had evaporated another
aroma commenced to assert itself, and the owner-
trainer, who gave the name “Arnold,” was asked for
explanations about Xylite, a four-year-old with a six-
year-old mouth, and a white patch on the wither
dyed black, and a place on the forehead from which
a white star had been removed. After “Arnold” had
been heard the horse was impounded, and when the
police went to have another yarn with him they
found he had vanished. He has kept on vanishing
ever since, and “the lady in black,” who is waiting
trial on a charge- of conspiracy, doesn’t know where
he is. This lady is Mrs. Cleary, otherwise Vera
Cleary, latterly a Sydney barmaid and daughter of;
a once-prominent racing man. ,
The horse called “Xylite” was clearly a ringer.
What is, its right name? The whisper about “Black-
lock” led to discovery of this: that the black horse
Blacklock, disqualified with his trainer, Alf Hardy,
at Richmond (N.S.W.) in June last, is alleged (1)'
to have been turned out at Burren Junction, but
could not be found there lately; (2) to have been
kept in racing condition at Rockdale until Septem-
ber 20, when trainer and horse disappeared. Mean-
while, Alf Hardy cannot be found, nor can “Jones,”
nor “Arnold,” and all three bear a striking resem-
blance to each other. Which is, temporarily, a pity
for Mr. Hardy, as until he has explained things and
shown how it is that Blacklock disappeared from
Rockdale and “Arnold” arrived four days after at
Brisbane with “Xylite” (which wasn’t the Xylite
purchased for Mrs. Cleary by “Jones”), people will
reckon that the smell is fairly loud. Meanwhile,
where is the real Xylite? Except that the animal
is alleged to have been trucked from Sydney to
Burren Junction, where Blacklock’s owner happened
to liye, the hag has passed from human ken. He
wouldn’t be a very healthy sort of animal for anyone
to have about the premises just now, anyway.
A well-known South Brisbane citizen lost a
son in Gallipoli some months ago. Last
week he learned that he had just lost
another. “Time I was doing my little bit,”
he said, and straightway enlisted.
Mrs. W. H. Groom, widow of the old boss
ot the Toowoomba Chronicle and Speaker
of the Queensland Assembly away back in the
seventies —and he was no chicken then —is
still hale enough to go round to local festivi-
ties. Witnessing a corroboree at a recent
‘ Queen’ -crowning, she recollected, just casu-
ally, that she had attended another cor-
roboree on the same spot 50 years ago.
The extension of the principle of State
subsidies leads to some unexpected results.
Bananaland pays foster mothers so much a
week for children supported, and insists, of
course, on State inspection of their homes.
Now, natural mothers, if widows or deserted,
and helped with the same pecuniary allowance
as the foster mothers ; wherefore a Parlia-
mentary group begins to argue, quite seri-
ously and logically, that the homes of these
natural mothers should be subjected to the
same inspection. The need for this is all
the more apparent from the fact that State
officials have more than once reported that
A DISAPPOINTMENT BREWING.
HE : “I’ve been joking the wife that I intend enlisting.”
SHE: "She doesn't believe yon mean it, surely?”
HE: “Yes she does — he, he!”
SHE: "My! Won't there be a row when she learns the truth!”
Queensland foster mothers, on the whole,
bring up the youngsters better than that
time-honored institution —Ma.
“Rangan”: Ryan soon got busy on the
unwritten plank of the Labor platform. All
departments, bar one, have sent up expenses.
The increases for the first five months of
this year read like this: Railways, £31,800;
Education, £10,600; Mines, £7448; Justice,
£5182; Lands, £3814. The trust funds are
going out at the rate of £2,000,000 a year ;
the loan funds at a trifle over £3,500,000.
Last month £301,925 of loan money was re-
quired to run this State of less than three-
quarters of a million inhabitants. For the
current financial year Ryan proposes to bor-
row £2,707,749. Meanwhile, J. Bull has
taken down the sign, “Business as usual,”
and displays instead, “Take a pull.” Also,
drought has Bananaland once more by the
throat; immigration is at a standstill; men
are being killed at the war —and a State
which already owes £BO per head, coolly adds
on another £4 and hands the bill to poor
little Posterity.
Ex-Minister Macartney :
There is a great deal of patriotism to be found in
the House, but it is not on the Government side.
The fact is Government supporters have sent
no representatives at all to the Front; the
Opposition has sent one. Neither side has
much to brag about. Out of 144 legislators,
one man (Col. Rankin) has recruited —-
something less than one per cent.
Prime Minister Hughes to a Brisbane
Trades Hall deputation that protested
against “compulsory” service :
You as unionists speak to me about compulsion.
Why, the Labor movement is based on compulsion.
In the very city where they then sat, hadn’t union-
ism at some period shown on what it was based?
Hadn’t every organisation shown that it stood on
compulsion when the occasion arose? They spoke to
him about compulsion, and evidently were not aware
that the party’s platform had for nearly 10 years
had as a basic plan military training.
Well, why doesn’t he?
“Bareoo”: Forty-three “Tucker Bills” —
latest for shearer—cleaned up 8976 sheep
in ordinary working hours at Terrick Ter-
l'iclt, Blackall, the other day. And just

Downs, 18 men shore 8900. This is the
shed at which Jack Howe, world’s champion
' '' -
blade-shearer, shore 321 in eight hours, cer-
tified to by the affidavit of Arthur Whit-

• The Queensland John Hop is trained to
duly reverence his official betters, and an
omission to properly salute the Commis-
sioner in the street is punished with a ten-
bob fine. Now the question arises, What is
Jennie Hop to do?
Queensland police are now organised into
a union and it is proposed to allow the St.
Helena (gaol) officials to do the same. The
next step will be to encourage the prisoners
to follow the good example.
Eighty on the 7th, pioneer Island mission-
ary George Brown, who now suns himself
at Gordon, near Sydney. Ilis youth was
not exactly religious ; he was outlawed from
his first pursuit of medicine for boyish pranks
with chemicals, and admits a juvenile know-
ledge of smuggling. A few years at sea
bi ought him to Maoriland, and there, when
only slightly over 20—an early age to
reform”—-he got under the influence of Pat-
terson and Selwyn, and became a missionary.
The Islands gave him all the excitement any
reasonable man could want. Like Lawes,
of Niue and New Guinea, he throve on cli-
mate _and queer diet, and is a hale man still,
m spite of his years.

QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP
Brisbane, December 11, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
The Karoola hospital ship, which arrived
here on Wednesday, had on board Sister
Ralston, who was formerly matron of the
Lady Lamington Hospital. Sister Ralston
has been ill; hence her transfer to transport
duty.
The week has been tilled with shrill re-
joicings from school children. On Wednes-
day night All Hallows’ Convent held its
annual concert and prize giving. The two
Grammar Schools followed on Friday. The
Governor presided, and forgot to mention
the fact —of which the old school is proud
—that over 400 Grammar boys are at the
Front.
At the Tivoli to-night “The Woman in the
Case” is being played. Vera Ramee slightly
reverses the usual order of things by loaning
to the heroine the auburn locks that
usually are the portion of the villainess,
Nellie Fergusson is Claire Forster, Aug-
ustus Neville is Julian Rolfe, and Roy Red-
grave is the lawyer. The whole show proves
that an Australian co. delivers the goods in
just as satisfactory a manner as an im-
ported one.
The Brisbane Musical Union gave “The
Messiah” at the Exhibition to-night before
a sparse audience.
To-day wa - a day of penitence and
prayer, but that did not affect the attend-
ance at the races. Perhaps the penitence
came afterwards, and the prayer later still,
when you tried to raise the tram-fare home.
Some very pretty garments were on the lawn.
Mrs. Jack Thomson wore pink, Mrs. Ryan
cream lace, Mrs. Stuart Hyslop Assam silk,
Mrs. Charlie Buchanan white, and Mrs.
Stanley Chapman mole color. There were
others, but you didn’t look so long at them.
Miss Brockway, whose father is a colonel
and a doctor, and in charge of a hospital
ship, is going to England, and probably will
be discovered in a military hospital later
on. She just wants to be an orderly, and
so free some man for work with gun and
bayonet.
A concert for the Russian .Jews’ Relief
Fund brought in good cash on Wednesday
night. Yesterday small girls in weird cos-
tumes and nimble ladies in their ordinary
Friday clothes pursued us all with collec-
tion boxes for the same fund.
At a benefit matinee at the Empire on
Wednesday afternoon £BO was raised for
the widow of the late Percy St. John. Stan-
hope’s Revue co., King’s Dramatic co. and
several unattached artists helped the pro-
gramme along.
The Soldiers’ Comforts’ Fund packed
another 20 case's for Gallipoli Bill this
week. Ninety cases were sent before the
Fund had been alive six weeks. Beat that
if you can !
Gwendolyn Stanley and Bill Grant, two
popular artists, tied the knot this week.
They can now pack their brushes in the
one box and steal each other’s cobalt blue.
Gwen does portraits and figure work, and
Bill is strong on landscapes, so that their
work won’t clash. Slaves of the pen and
the brush have been saying they wish they
had the luck.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

SELECTED RECIPES FROM HERE AND THERE. —THINGS EVERY WOMAN WANTS
TO KNOW.
The Magnetism of Beautiful
Hair.
“Applied Arts.”
Beautiful liair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men aud women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
lookout for any harmless thing that will
increase the natural beauty of their hair.
The latest method is to use pure stallax as a
shampoo, on account of the peculiarly glossy,
fluffy and wavy effect which it leaves. As
stallax has never been used much for this
purpose it comes to the chemist only in lib.
sealed original packages, enough for twenty-
five or thirty shampoos. A teaspoonful of the
fragrant stallax granules, dissolved in a cup
of hot water, is more than sufficient for each
shampoo. It is very beneficial and stimulat-
ing to the hair, apart from its beautifying
effect.
Permanently Removing
Superfluous Hair.
“Toilet Gossip.”
How to permanently, not merely tempo-
rarily, remove a downy growth of disfiguring
superfluous hair, is what many women wish
to know. It is a pity that it is not more
generally known that pure powdered pheminol.
obtainable from the chemists, may be used
for this purpose. It is applied directly to
the objectionable hair. The recommended
treatment not only instantly removes the
hair, leaving no trace, but is designed also to
kill the roots completely. .
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
A simple, old-fashioned, home-made recipe Will make
the greyncss disappear.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to a
natural color in a perfectly harmless manner.
You have only to get an ounce of fammalite
concentrate from your chemist and mix it
with four ounces of bay rum to prove this.
Apply this simple and harmless lotion tor a
few nights to the hair with a small sponge and
the greyness will gradually disappear. lhe
lotion is neither sticky nor greasy, and has
been proved over and over again for genera-
tions past by those in possession ot the lor-
mula.
To Have Smooth, White
Skin, Free from Blemish.
“Boudoir Gossip.”
Does your skin chap or roughen easily, or
become unduly red or blotchy '! Let me tell
you a quick and easy way to overcome the
trouble and keep your complexion beautifully
white, smooth and soft. Just get _ some
ordinary mercolised wax at the chemist s and
use a little before retiring as you would use
cold cream. The wax, through some peculiar
action, flecks off the rough, discolored or
blemished skin. The worn-out cuticle comes
off just like dandruff on a diseased scalp, only
in almost invisible particles. Mercolised wax
simply hastens Nature’s work, which is the
rational and proper way to attain a perfect
complexion, so much sought after, but very
seldom seen. The process is perfectly simple
and quite harmless.
Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous remedy for blackheads, greasy skin
and large pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now _ coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very simple,
harmless and pleasant. Drop a stymol tablet,
obtained at the chemist’s, in a tumbler full
of hot water. After the effervescence has
subsided bathe the face in the liquid, using a
j small sponge or soft cloth. In a few minutes
dry the face and the offensive blackheads will
coine right off on the towel. Also the large
oily pores immediately close up and efface
themselves naturally. The greasiness dis-
appears and the skin" is left smooth, soft and
cool. This simple treatment is then repeated
a few times at intervals of four or five days to
i ensure the permanence of the result. H

One noted firm of pill-makers advertises:
Don’t send useless things to your sweetheart at
the Front. Send him a box of our pills. The
human system becomes very irregular after a few
days’ hardships in the trenches.
What you might call a moving appeal!
“G.S.K.” puts another view of the case
from London :
If you want to keep a good opinion of the English-
man and “the British spirit” and a few other things,
don’t come here at present. I go to recruiting meet-
ings, and after hearing the slang-whanging I come
away asking myself, “Great heavens, are these the
people I’m supposed to be proud of belonging to?”
Waata Wiremu Hipango, an ancient
Maori who headed for the Happy Hunting
Ground at Putiki (M.L.) recently, was the
last of the little, band of brown men who in
the early GO's of last century were selected
by Hori Grey to receive the blessings of
European education at Wellington (M.L.).
Grey’s scheme for completely altering the
destiny of the native race was a partial
failure, wholesale absorption of knowledge
being found impracticable except in rare
cases, and old Hipango’s wasn’t one of them.
In January, 1908, less than a score —14
to be exact —bold men went along to the
Sydney Trades Hall and formed the since
greatly-grown and rapidly-growing Clerks’
Union. Others offered their sympathy ; but
in view of the fact that the meeting was
advertised, and employers were alleged to
be on the lookout, they did not attend. Those
14 were the foundation members, and the
ninth of them to enlist went into camp last
week. The others are all family men with
numerous little good excuses for not enlist-
ing. Nine out of 14 is a good record, any-
way.
“D.F.”: There was a surprise packet
among the letters to his Ex. of Tasmania
the other day. It was from one John L.
Taylor, of Sorell, who deposed as follows: —
I call on the Sorell Council, in God’s name,
to answer to your Excellency for the wilful destruc-
tion of gates, finger-post boards and fences, and to
answer to your Excellency for the following abomi-
nations which have been permitted for so many
years: Sheep-stealing, house-breaking, house a,nd
fence stripping, perpetual thieving, dog-shooting,
splitting, wasting and destroying timber without
license, trespassing, stock running at large, death-
traps on roads, neglect of roads, allowing workmen
to keep their own time, unfair inspection, suppress-
ing letters, cheating, bribery, ballot-box stacking,
loafing, drink-shouting, boasting, bating, backbiting,
discharging firearms on the public roads on Sunday,
persecuting reformers, refusing to erect information
boards, contempt for the poor, contempt for the
sick, contempt for the Almighty. 1 feel sure that
your Excellency will uphold that high position which
God has given to you with honor.
Then his Ex. took the longest breath he can
remember and knocked off for the day to
contemplate the job.
“Customs Agent”: A feature of recent
shipping-lists is the number of small Yankee
schooners with names like Geo. Iv. Sniggins
arriving and listed to arrive. These small
craft, 400 to 800 tons register, are employed
staggering across from the Pacific Slope with
cargoes of Oregon and redwood. They are
eagerly chartered (our State timber-yard has
snapped up a small fleet) at 90s. to 955. a.
thousand super feet. Load lines aren’t
known in the U.S.A., and these small dug-
outs come into port with deck cargoes half-
way up the rigging. It is calculated that
any one of these schooners that waits to
load back freight to ’Frisco can earn her
market value in the round voyage, but with
soaring freights in Puget Sound _ and else-
where many choose to run back in ballast.
Verily, the Susan J. Gubbins is having the
time of her life.
“F.I-L”: The Australian tailor, for one,
begins to feel the pinch. Money is dear, and
many Australians are learning that it is
better to do without a thing than to order
it and have it “put down.” Also, over a
hundred thousand Australian young men are
wearing Government suits. The most bitter
moment of all, though, for Scissors is when
he sees one of his good customers wearing a
suit left behind by Brother Jim, gone for
a soldier. And he sees him very often.
“Jaques”: In two clever robberies that
have taken place recently the operators in-
tercepted cheques posted to a Sydney pro-
duce co. One was an open order for £5B
and the other a crossed cheque for £29. How
the robbers managed to obliterate the cross-
ing on the latter and cash it is a mystery,
but it goes to prove that the usual “not
negotiable” is no safeguard, and other means
ought to be adopted by the various banks
in Australia to protect themselves as well
as their depositors. I suggest that they
should agree on two distinct standard
cheques, say a blue form for open cheques
and a red form for “bank” cheques. If
anybody has any fault to find with the idea
let* him take the. pulpit before I go round
with the plate for a bonus.
Some years ago MelDourne was mildly
startled by the exploit of a Gippsland girl,
Miss Eve Waddington, who, fascinated by the
skittish city hansoms, hired one of the
Vehicles from a suburban livery stable and
A rove it round town. Inside was a demure
girl undergrad, of Melbourne University,
who afterwards became a dentist" and mar-
ried a pressman. Now Bendigo comes to
the front with a cab woman who is on the
job in earnest. Mrs. Charlotte Jackson’s
husband was a cabby, and when he went
into camp his wife succeeded to the box-
seat. Their only son is already fighting.
The-lady drives a two-horse growler between
the city and the camp. But that’s in the
afternoons. In the mornings _she raises
pigs, fruit and chickens, and when time hangs
heavy she knits socks.
John Berry, who went out the other day,
got a good 'helping of adventure with his 90
years’ lease. At the age of" 14 he fought
in the battle of Acre and was decorated for
conspicuous bravery. Later he had more
fight in the Maori war. But the event of
his life was a voyage in the Buzzard in
search of Franklin, and the old man will he
best remembered as the last link with that
expedition. For nearly three years the Buz-
zard hunted the Arctic, going as far north-
ward as Point Barrows, and incidentally
discovering a plantation of onions. r lhe seed
had been sown by the crew of the Blossom in
’2G. Berry got frostbitten on the voyage
and was apparently improved by the bite.
Anyway, several people who had never been
bitten are known to have died at 89.

. You may think it’s kidney trouble every time you have a
backache, but most likely it is your digestion which is wrong.
It is probably your stomach trying to put part of its work on your
kidneys, and they refuse.
The proper thing is to make your stomach do its share of the
work, which can easily be done by taking Chamberlain’s Tablets
for the stomach and liver.
They cleanse your bowels of all impurities, thus relieving
your kidneys by natural methods which never fail to restore you
to perfect health. For headache, biliousness, indigestion and

Manager, Watworth Co. Samlgate, Qld.
Dear Sir, —When I wrote you in July last my niece was rapidly improving under
your treatment. She was then over 15 stone in weight, blit has since been reduced to
truly genteel proportions, and is now a very pleasing figure. She continued her usual
diet while under treatment, and was in no way inconvenienced, and I am truly grateful
to you for the result, for, before the treatment she was absolutely devoid of any semb-
lance of a figure, a burden to herself and friends, and unhappy generally. She has
reduced considerably over three stone, and her health lias improved to a splendid
—Yours respectfully, M. CRAJIB.
NOTHING LIKE PROOF TO CONVINCE!
Girilambone, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs, —I am quite satisfied with
your wonderful treatment. It has made a
new woman of me. I have lost weight
wonderfully, and my breathing is all right
now. Sinee taking the Ti-Sarkin I can
do my work without a bit of trouble. I
will never lose an opportunity to praise
and tell everybody that needs Ti-Sarkin
about your marvellous treatment.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) Mrs. JOHNSON.
3frs. C. SCHULTZ, of Albury, writing,
says
“After being fat and uncomfortable for
years, your treatment has reduced me won-
derfully. I have taken in my clothes three
times since starting its use.”
Mrs. Ij. JOYCE, of Adelong, writes:—
“During the six weeks I have been using
Ti-Sarkin my bust has decreased by 8
inches, waist by 4, and hips by 7 inches.
A truly marvellous result.
"TI-SARKIN”
r. '
positively removes excess fat and will restore'your spoiled
figure to decent and "pleasing proportions f it is always a
sure and lasting cure for obesity and corpulency. A few
doses improves your breathing wonderfully, and the course
of treatment will cure you. It is the only successful, and,
at the same time, harmless fat-reducer that has ever been
discovered. Its efficacy has been undeniably demonstrated in
thousands of successfully treated cases. It is totally and
absolutely non-poisonous, and can in no wise work any
injury to the general health, even though it often reduces
excess of weight by as much as a pound a day. On the
contrary, improved conditions in the general health become
noticeable in less than a week after its use is begun.
“TI-SARKIN” PROVED WONDERFUL.
Mt. Warrenheip,
To the Manager, Victoria.
Watworth Co.
Dear Sir, —Yours received, and I am pleased to he able to tell
you that there is a decided improvement in my figure and
health since using “Ti-Sarkin.” In addition to the consider-
able noticeable reduction in size, my flesh is much firmer.
All my friends tell me I am looking splendid. lam perfectly
satisfied that your treatment is as wonderful as you said it
was, as I know of a couple of other women who have been as
greatly benefited by its use as I have been.
I shall always recommend it to my friends or acquaintances,
and hope to he the means of bringing considerable business
your way, as I feel so pleased with what it has done for me.
Yours faithfully,

No

In every household there
comes the sudden emergency
when a child is seedy— a
husband is home late—
a wife has to be put on a
specially light diet. That is
the moment when Horlick’s
Malted Milk comes in so
handily. It is no trouble
to make, always proves
palatable, and can be given
with impunity to sick child,
tired husband, or dyspeptic
wife unhesitatingly, as it has
all the required ingredients
(Milk, Wheat and Malt) to
meet each case.

“Hamer”: Shoplifting is a twentieth-
century profession, and most of the larger
fluff stores find it necessary to employ pri-
vate detectives ; and now the habit of lifting
meals is alleged to be growing. There are
numerous ways of pursuing this industry;
and if the worst comes to the worst the
practitioner can simply brazen it out. The
money owed for a meal is a civil debt; and
if the restaurant-keeper wants to recover it
he has to proceed by summons, which is,
comparatively speaking, a costly, lengthy
and unsatisfactory method. Mr. Bung .is
on a better wicket, because the law which
places upon him the necessity of providing
the public with refreshment allows him to
give the defaulting lodger or diner in charge
as a vagabond.
* * * *
“Nobby”: Talking of ancient craft, we
have a couple of arks at Newcastle that will
take some beating. .T. A. Brown’s paddle
tugboat Bungaree was built 54 years ago
and is still doing nearly all the firm’s harbor
work. As she was fitted with new boilers
about six years ago I expect she will run
long enough to earn the old-age pension.
She is not much use for sea work, but for
smooth-water there are not many boats in
Australia with as much towing power. The
Government pilot steamer Ajax has also
been running for over 50 years. She was
originally a tugboat, but an economical
Government had an upper deck put on her
in ’97 to give more accommodation.' Part of
the duty of this patriarch, by the way, is
to hobble out with the lifeboat when the
latter craft is called for. It sounds almost
like a joke, doesn’t it?
* * * *
“Lee-oli” : The last of the old-timer Island
schooners, the Ysabel, blows in and out of
Auckland Harbor with almost the regu-
larity of a steamer. The Ysabel wasn’t
built for copra-carrying or for her schooner
rig. More than 40 years ago she started out
in life as the Melanesian Mission’s steam
barquentine Southern Gross, with a coffee-
mill of an engine that gave her as much as
six knots an hour when a Solomon Islander
sat on the safety-valve. A quarter of a cen-
tury’s tramping about with missionaries and
hymn-books and Kanaka converts fairly
earned the old hooker a pension and a halo ;
but the impecunious mission sold her to the
ungodly traders, who changed her name as
well as her face. The skipper gave her a
handier rig, bundled the old contraption of
an engine out of her, and for all her narrow-
gutted crank-looking steamboat build he has
found her a stiff and reliable craft in the
worst weather that ever struck a South Sea
schooner. And, made of heart-of-kauri, she
seems good for another 20 years.

“Cripps Clark” : “W.C.M.” (B. 18/11/’l5)
is still unconvinced that his amusing
scheme of co-operativd' shearing and wool
marketing for coekies is unworkable. • His
retort to my remark that if jumbuck’s over-
coats were all alike it might be managed, is
that “similar sheep on similar country pro-
duce similar wool.” Quite so, but my con-
tention was that coekies’ flocks are anything
but similar. If he visited a big store-sheep
market —say, Goulburn —he could see sheep
sold from runs not five miles apart at prices
varying from ss. to 20s. Now, can one
imagine how sheep with this wide range of
value are to be shorn and the wool marketed
in a lump to the satisfaction of the
various owners? It is all very well
to speak of the advantage of selling
20 bales of first-combing wool under
one brand against 10 lots of two bales
each ; but how about the cookies who have,
say, half a bale of “bellies” and a quarter
of a bale of “locks”? Would the unhappy
classer have to weigh each fleece before
putting it into the bin and credit it to the
owner? Would the haughty shearer be ex-
pected to identify every sheep he hauled put
of the catching pen as belonging to Smith,
Brown or Robinson? “Simply a matter
of book-keeping,” says “W.C.M.” Yes, but
it wouldn’t be simple book-keeping.
“F.H.” i To those familiar with the
gloomy tree, it may come as a surprise to
learn that, for cabinet-work, myrtle is full
of gladsome color. A Melbourne firm has
lately completed what the assistant-polisher
calls a boodwar-sweet of this wood, and it
is enough to make any Australian-native
rise up and give three loud crows. Among
the articles is a cheval-glass which is most
likely the nearest approach to pink marble,
in timber, yet seen in this country; and a
rosy shade permeates the whole of the
material in the suite. This piece of work is
part of the furniture in the Percy Owens’
Australian-timbered house at Ashburton,
over at the back of Malvern, and is the first
of its kind to be put together in the State.
* * * *
“Moana”: In one respect, anyhow, the
big Exposition at ’Frisco is unique. The
mortgage that had the concern and the pro-
moters by the neck was paid off and publicly
burnt three months ago. A smaller exposi-
tion at San Diego, lower down the Cali-
fornian coast, has also been a colossal or a
gigantic or some other U.S. sort of success.
There the promoters paid their debts during
the first week and have been dressed in
smiles ever since.
SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The breakfast hour had struck at Bloom’s,
And fat Rebecca bore
The curly kiddies from their rooms,
Called Ikey from the store.
“Come, Ikey Bloom, id's geddin’ late” ;
And, “Vait,” said Ikey—“can’t you vait?”
Three minutes passed. She called again.
To still his wife’s appeal
Ike condescended to explain:
“Shoost keeb avile der meal;
A fi-ure iss, der peoble say,
Ad Minsky’s shob across de vay.”
Another minute passed, and. Ike
Came in with joyous face.
“A splentit fi-ure, if you like,
Across at Minsky’s place.

Und for our prealcfast ve’ll haf toast!”

Are you Worried about Baby ?
HOW to feed Baby is often a great worry to
mothers who are unable to nurse their
babies themselves. Ordinary cow’s milk—
however prepared at home—is not a suitable
substitute for the mother’s milk. It is acid m
reaction, contains harmful germs and forms
dense curds in the stomach that cannot be
digested. Decide to use the ‘Allenburys’ Foods
which are the only series of Foods scientifically
adapted to the growing requirements of the
child. You will be delighted when you see
how well your baby thrives on this Method of
Infant Feeding. The ‘Allenburys’ Foods are free
from all dangerous organisms; they are portable,
being in powder form and packed in sealed tins.
The Milk Foods Nos. 1. and 2 require the addition
of hot water only to prepare them for use.

Unsolicited Testimony-
A Mother in South Australia writes:
“1 see by your circulars you have pamphlets on infants feeding and
management. Kindly send me one, it may prove very helpful now or
in the future. I have a beautiful boy fed on your foods since infancy,
we tried other foods (not knowing of yours) and they almost killed
him, he became so thin and old looking that I felt compelled to htive
the doctor’s advice. Directly he saw the child he said he was being
starved, he was nothingbut bone ; he told me to try Allen & Hanbury s
foods and see how they would act. I did so with a marvellous result,
in a week there was a big change, he is now eleven months old and
such a big boy—not flabby fat but proportionate. He is just starting
to walk and has eight teeth so you see his illness has not made him
backward. I feel I cannot say enough for your foods and advertise
them all I can. Trusting you will send the pamphlet I asked for,"
Yours ever grateful,
Mrs. H. Pearson.
A Doc'or In New Zealand writes:
Gentlemen,
“It may interest you to know that your Infants Poods are largely
prescribed by us out here and are found to fulfil all they promise
to do. I find the No. i Food most invaluable. The young mother of
to-day seemTquite unable to nurse her offspring.”
I am, faithfully yours,

TWO FAVORITES-
Gwen Burroughs and Rexona
Rexona .Pty. Company,
SYDNEY.
Dear Sirs, —You have heard
that I have been using Rexona
and Rexona Soap. This is quite
true, and I want to tell you
what I think of them. They
are both simply excellent. I
always keep a pot of Rexona
on my dressing-table, and con-
sider it simply indispensable.
I always use it after surfing,
and find it simply splendid for
sunburn and for preserving the
skin.
As for Rexona Soap, it is
wonderful how lovely it makes
the hair, so soft and silky,
and it is so refreshing. I
think every girl should use
Rexona Soap, and 1 am sure
I shall never miss an oppor-
tunity of recommending both
Rexona and Rexona Soap.—
Yours sincerely,
(Sgd.)

BURROUGHS.
(From a photograph.)
Miss Gwen Burroughs is an accomplished actress as well as a beautiful woman.
Her Iris in “Ben Hur” is well remembered as a fine study of the East. Miss
Burroughs’s appearance in “Within the Law” and “Joseph and His Brethren”
was delightful, and she is now making a big hit as Bess in “Kick-in” at the Cri-
terion (Sydney). Miss Burroughs is a strong advocate of Rexona and Rexona
Soap ; she has used them both.
| EVERYBODY’S USING IT NOW. i
Rexona Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone who values
a pure and healthy skin. Rexona will at once heal all the minor injuries to the

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
morning, muffled steps were heard,
Soft rustlings in a passage-way,
While wan lips framed a magic word
There in a room where all was dark ;
The blinds were drawn against the day !
The blinds were drawn ; the very air
Hung like a veil about the place
Heavy with perfuming; and there
The mysteries of joy and pain
Alternate lingered on her face.
Soft brown hair dusking on the white,
And pale cheeks on the pillow set;
The blinds were drawn —yet there was light
Within her soul to flood the world.
White fingers plucked the coverlet!
Oh, tender, loving Motherhood!
What wondrous miracle is this
To-day my heart hath understood?
Take kiss for kiss, take tear for tear!
These are my tears; this is my kiss!
MAOEILAND.
BOYCE BOWDEN.
The Harp that Once.
AN IRISH FANTASY IN FIVE ACTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Note. —The harp that once Amergin, the oldest of
Irish bards, played in a golden age was lost, buried
under the darkness of centuries of sorrow. The
modern revival of Celtic literature marks the finding
of the harp again. It is discovered where Synge,
Yeats and Stevens looked for it —in a peasant’s cabin.]
Act I.
A hill slope covered with whin hushes. In
the background is seen a cluster of ancient
stone buildings. The sky is overcast and a
cold wind moans along the hill.
Keefe : ’Twas surely the wonder of the
high gods, the music that was made.
Alt : The wonder, surely, for the harp that
was silent for a long time, sang the old songs
that it had learned when it was young, and
him not moving the strings at all.
Keefe : And the old king had a good death,
for all his years and the black sorrow that
was on him.
Alt : A good death, surely, with the brown
sword of him in his hand, and him with his
face to the open door and the high moun-
tains where the mists are.
Keefe : Ay, he will be with the mists now,
and him a mist also, wreathing about a
stone or a bush of heather, with only a long
thought of other days that were better than
these days.
Amergin, the bard, comes in carrying his
harp. He leans heavily for support on a
loutish, half-witted boy who carries a brown
copper bow shaped to hold the harp. The old
bard’s thin white hair is blown by the wind,
Alt : What is it the old man would be
doing now? Surely he is very old, and in a
short while he will be with the king.
Amergin (in a, quavering voice): Do you
go now for the spade; for it is here that we
will bury it out of sight of them that have
made the green world red with true blood.
The boy goes out, and the old man stands
on shaking limbs fondling the black wood of
the harp. Once he touches a string, and a
strange wild melody fills the air as with
tears.
Alt : He will be burying the harp now, for
he will play on it no more; and it is not
right that another should touch what was his
so long.
Keefe: It is the ending of the world,
surely, for there will be the Great Music no
more.
The boy returns with a spade.
Amergin : Do you dig here now at my feet
while I make a long thought towards the
high gods; for it is surely the burial of the
green world’s best friend.
The boy digs.
Do you set it in the hole that you have
made, and throw the brown sods upon it.
that it may sleep well till the high gods will
need it again.
The boy lays the box in the hole. As the
first clods of earth fall upon it the harp sends
forth a long plaintive note.
Farewell, child of my song !
As he speaks the harp strings murmur once
again, The boy fills up the hole, beating
down the earth with the spade. The old
bard, bent and trembling, leans on his shoul-
der and totters feebly away.
Alt : The kingdom is destroyed ; the king
is dead ; and the Great Music that was the
high men is laid in a small grave.
Keefe : It is surely the end.
Act 11.
The same place after a lapse of .1/000 years.
The old buildings are gone, but Kelly’s cabin
has been built near where they once stood,
and beyond the cabin is a road, shut in on
either side by high, straggling, hawthorn
hedges.
Kelly is lying on the ground near a whin
bush, snoring loudly. Mrs. Kelly conies out
from the cabin, climbs the sod wall of the
garden, and looks around until she sees
Kelly's huge boots protruding from the
bushes below. She comes down and shakes
him roughly by the shoulder.
Mrs. Kelly : Is it two shillings and a
threepenny piece was all you were after get-
ting for the black pig, and it fat for killing?
Kelly (half asleep, but sitting up): Is it
no more than that w’as in my old coat when
you took it off?
Mrs. Kelly : ’Twas no more, surely. Had
you_ no more money at all ?
Kelly : ’Twas what I got for the pig,
surely, and maybe a small sup or two of
potheen.
Mrs. Kelly : Troth, you made a fine bar-
gain, and me and the three childer to go
out^ on the bare road this day.
Kelly : Whisht, woman, for you have a
bad tongue. Have we not two pigs more?
Mrs. Kelly : Can you sell two pigs this
day, and you foolish in your wits, having
drink taken? Is it not this day the black
agent man—bad cess to him—will be com-
ing here for the rent?
Kelly (getting on his feet): Troth. Norah,
I forgot. ’Tis myself is the great fool this
day. Och, the head of me, and it going
round. Show me the agent man. Put you
and the childer out in the road ! Och, ay !
Will you show me this agent man, Norah
Kelly. ’Tis myself will hit him a kick he
will not be forgetting for a short while if
he puts his round nose in at that door this
day.
Mrs. Kelly : Whisht, whisht! ’Tis drunk
you are still, surely. Lie down a while and
sleep more, for ’tis shamed I will be before
the neighbors, and you not decent.
Kelly (lying down): I will sleep a small
while yet, for my head is not right. But the
agent man will not put you out and two good
pigs to sell.
Mrs. Kelly looks at him for a few
moments, and as his snoring is renewed
walks away to the cabin. A cart goes noisily
down the road. Kelly sleeps on.
Act 111.
The same place later in the day.
Kelly (starting oat of his sleep): The
wonder of the living world! (Rubbing his
eyes.) Och, ’tis dreaming I am, and me
feeling my hands in yellow gold up to the
shirt-sleeves! (Looking down at his feet.)
Surely, ’twas more than a dream ; for I dug
down there where my two boots are, and the
spade hit hard on the box lid. Will I not get
a spade and try?
He sits looking at the ground for a minute,
then rises and walks to the sod wall. lie
reaches over and gets a long spade.
’Tis the fool of the world you are, Dan
Kelly, to be taking work from your own
dreams, and no pay for you at all.
He comes back to the spot where he had.
been sleeping.
’Tis the good shape of myself I have made
in the grass, and me sleeping out with the
goats for the potheen in my hot head.
He begins digging and throwing out the
earth. Presently the spade strikes loudly on
metal, and a long, strange note rings out
from the hole he has dag.
Holy Saints! ’Tis the glory of Ireland!
’Twas the dream that told me. Dan Kelly,
you’re a made man.
He capers with delight on the edge of the
hole, then renews his digging with greater
energy.
A fine box, surely, but a queer shape. ’Tis
copper it is with the green on it from being-
long in the ground.
He lifts the box out of the hole and ex-
amines it. Then, using the blade of the
spade as a lever, he bursts it open and
reveals the ancient harp of Amergin.
The black curse on my luck this day ! ’Tis
not gold at all but an old black fiddle thing.
Och, Dan Kelly, but your dreams make you
a worse fool than the potheen itself!
He takes up the harp and touches a string
with his rough finger. It is the middle
string. At once a subtle, intoxicating melody
fills the air. It is as if the soul of all good-
ness and. fine comradeship had been turned
into sweet sound. The thought of all his friends
and neighbors rushes in upon him with great
kindness; and he longs to take the world in
his arms and dandle it like a crowing child.
He touches another string and a new melody
floods him with changed feeling. Every
separate string has an appeal to a different
primal instinct.
Gold was it, gold I wanted? Och, ’tis
more than gold. ’Tis like the kisses of seven
fine girls on the mouth and potheen in the
throat. ’Tis like wakes and graves, and a
fine joke a man will be making, and a jig-
dancing on the wind in summer-time, and a
long, hard fight with two big men and them
not able to beat you. Och, ’tis the wonder
of the world !
He lies at full length on the ground,
slowly fingering the separate strings.
’Tis myself will be the first fiddler in the
green world. Sure, I am learning to know
the music that is in it, and never a man to
teach me at all.
A cart rattles down the road and stops at
the cabin.
’Tis the big string for fight. I will leave
that one alone maybe. ’Tis the little string
for laughing. Och, and, sure, they will
laugh well to my bold fiddle. ’Tis the one
with the silver twist on the end of it that
draws the tears out of you; and ’tis the
next one would set the goats themselves
dancing. But, och, ’tis the middle string of
all that makes the music of the good heart.
’Tis a sweet string, surely, for the devil a
bad thought would there be at all with that
one trembling all the time. Dan Kelly, is it
mad you are or dreaming still, or have you
dug up the key of Heaven and Hell from
under an old whin bush? Troth, and I’ll
go and try it a small while on Norah.
Act IV.
Inside Kelly's cabin. Music of the harp
heard without.
Mrs. Kelly : ’Tis a strange sound and a
sweet sound. Och, where is it coming from
at all?
She dabs at her eyes with her apron.
Sure, ’tis the sorrowfullest sound ever came
up this black world. Bad luck to the music.
Och, ’tis worse than two funerals in one
day and them both burying my mother.
She sits down and weeps bitterly. The
tune ceases. A cart stops at the door and
O' Flanagan comes in.
O’Flanagan : ’Tis the fine phonograph
you have, Mrs. Kelly, and it playing all the
tunes of the world.
Mrs. Kelly: ’Tis no phonograph at all I
have, O’Flanagan. Can you tell me now
where the sound comes from?
The harp begins again with a new air.
and they are filled with an uncontrollable
desire to dance.
O’Flanagan : Up. woman, up!
Mrs. Kelly: Och, ’tis the lightest heart
I have this day.
They face one another across the room,
arms on hips and chins in air, and begin to
dance a furious jig on the uneven earthen
floor. The music suddenly stops.
O’Flanagan : ’Twas the queerest thing the
way the tune got into m,v heels.
Mrs. Kelly (wiping the perspiration
from, her face): ’Twas a fine tune, surely.
Kelly comes to the door carrying" the
harp.
Kelly: ’Tis myself is king of the living
world !
Mrs. Kelly : ’Tis mad drunk you are,

with the potheen not out of your head.
( Seeing harp.) Where did you get that/
Is it yourself is making the music, and you
buying a phonograph for a pig and not let-
ting on to me that is your own wife? Was
ever the like heard for alack folly, and the
rent to pay this day?
O’Flanagan: ’Tis no phonograph at all,
Mrs. Kelly. Sure, a phonograph is a box
with a handle and a spout for the music to
come out at.
Kelly (smiling) : Whisht, till I tell you
a piece of a small joke I’m after hearing
at Banagh fair.
He touches the small string, and all three
are immediately convulsed with merriment.
Mrs. Kelly fails half across the table and
shrieks with laughter. O’Flanagan is
doubled up, holding for support to the door.
Kelly capers round the room waving the
harp and shouting wildly in great gusts of
mirth. The tune stops suddenly, and the
laughter dies as quickly as it began.
O’Flanagan : Sure, ’twas a great joke.
Will you be telling me again, Kelly? I
have no head for remembering; but ’twas
the fun of the world.
Mks. Kelly : What was I laughing at at
aii?
Kelly touches another string, and as the
music throbs through the room Mrs. Kelly
As transfigured. She seems ten years
'younger. Her eyes have grown soft with a
great tenderness, as of one who would be
mother to all the ivorld. O’Flanagan’s
broad face is wreathed in good-natured
smiles, and he seems to expand and breathe
kindness through the room.
Mks. Kelly : Och, Dan !
O’Flanagan : Sure, Kelly, you’re the
devil of the world and the best man God
ever made. Och, wait now, boys! ’Tis
myself must go down the road a piece. Sure,
there’s them must hear your fiddle, Kelly,
with their own two ears. ’Tis too good a
thing to have and not show them all.
He goes out quickly, and the cart is heard
to rattle away.
Mrs. Kelly : Och. Dan !
She stretches her arms yearningly
towards him. A loud knock is heard at the
door, and the landlord’s Agent comes in.
Agent : A fine day, Mrs. Kelly. The rent
is due. ( Catching the effect of the music.)
Why, certainly, certainly. Next week will
do quite as well. Don’t mention it at all.
By the way, Mrs. Kelly.
He goes close to her and presses a handful
of money into her hand.
Now, please, don’t say anything about it,
ma’am. Merely a trifling gift that it is an
honor to make to hardworking people like
yourselves. Spend it on the children. Oh,
and, by the way—that matter of reducing
the rent. I’ll see what can be done. I’ll
try—that’s the best I can say.
Kelly changes the tune quickly. He
steadies himself on a stool and touches the
dancing string. Airs. Kelly and the Agent
dance a jig until they are on the point of
exhaustion, and Kelly then suddenly moves a
finger and dissolves them in tears. The door
opens and O’Flanagan comes back bringing
with him four or five neighbors and Father
Doyle.
Father Doyle : Who is it is dead at
all? Sure, I was never before as sad as I
am this day.
Kelly: Och, cheer up, Father; for tis
myself has a good ploy to tell you would
make a cat laugh, and it eating herring.
' He touches the laughing string. and the
whole company is intoxicated with mirth.
Then the music and laughter end together.
Father Doyle : But what was the joke
at all. Kelly? ’Tis dying 1 am with laughter,
but what was it you said?
Ket,t,y : There is no joke at all, Father,
surely. ’Tis the queer old fiddle that makes
the heart glad or sorry when it plays.
Father Doyle looks at the harp.
Father Doyle : ’Tis a strange instru-
ment, Kelly. Where did you get this?
Kelly : ’Twas out of a hole in the ground
that I dug it this day.
Father Doyle : An ancient Irish harp,
surely, and clean and perfect. Now wait a
bit, now wait a bit. There is a word written
on it in Irish that I should be able to read.
He takes the harp to the door and slowly
puzzles out the antique writing. The others
stand round waiting in wonder. _
’Tis a strange word is written on it, Kelly,
and I doubt it is a hard one for you.
Kelly : Will you read it to us, Father ?
Father Doyle : I am not sure of every
stroke, but there is no doubt about what it
means. Here it is: “The man that plays
upon me, and keeps me, and makes not the
Great Music of five strings shall surely die.’
Can you make the Great Music of the five
strings, Kelly?
\ Kelly : ’Deed no, Father.
Father Doyle : Och, well, maybe ’tis but
an old heathen word that you need not heed.
Kelly ( trembling ) : ’Tis a great fear is
come on me this day.
Father Doyle : There are two ways you
can go. Either you must learn to play the
five strings for the Great Music or find a
man that will take the old harp from you.
Kelly: O’Flanagan, will you have the
harp? ,
O’Flanagan : ’Tis not for the likes ot
me with six children and a horse to keep. .
Kelly (to Agent): Will you take it, sir.
Agent : What should I do with the thing i
Present it to a museum if you want to get
Kelly : Och, what will I do ? What will
1 do?
Father Doyle: Maybe, Kelly, tis no
matter. Many an old curse is dead with
the long years. „ ..„
Kelly (wildly): Is the old fiddle dead.
Is it not able to talk? Och, surely the curse
is on me. What will I do? What will I
do? . T
Father Doyle (sighing) : When 1 was a
young man Och. well, no matter. I
am an old man, and maybe not so head-
strong, but no wiser. But there is surely a
young man somewhere in Ireland this, day
would laugh in the face of black death itself
for a chance to plav the five strings of that
harp to make the Great Music.
Act Y.
Kelly's cabin at night.
Kelly: ’Tis surely a dead man I am this
night, and me not knowing.
Mrs. Kelly : ’Tis a widow I will be if
you sit here and do nothing.
Kelly: Och, Norah!
A knock is heard at the door. Mrs. Kelly
rises and opens it.
Voice at the Door: Is it here that the
old harp is that was dug up from the
ground ?
Mrs. Kelly : Will you walk in, stranger,
for ’tis here that the old harp is, surely,
with the black curse on it.
The stranger comes in.
Kelly: Good evening to you, sir. Is it
the old harp you would be wanting to see':
The Stranger : It is the old harp that I
would hear; for it has been in my dreams
always these long years.
Kelly takes the harp from the corner and
brings it to the table.
Kelly : ’Tis the wonder of the world for
music, but the curse is on me black this
night.
The Stranger : The curse ? What curse
is there in a great fount of ancient music?
Kelly : ’Tis written upon it in Irish, for
Father Doyle read it off this day.
The Stranger : And what may this
curse be?
Kelly : “The man that plays upon me
and keeps me and makes not the Great
Music of five strings shall surely die.” ’Tis
those words are upon the black wood of it.
The Stranger : I see the inscription,
but I am too poor an Irish scholar to read
it myself. May I touch the strings?
Mrs. Kelly: Och, sir, can you play the
five strings together to make the Great
Music? Surely you will bring the curse
upon you that is on Kelly himself.
The Stranger: I do not fear the curse.
Kelly : Will you take the harp, young
man, if I give it to you?—for, surely, I have
played it with my own hand, and a great
fear is on me.
The Stranger: Why, man, do you know
what this gift means? Do you know that
in that black frame, and in those five tight
strings, is all the mystery and wonder of the
years—the wild, sweet ache of love; the
pure pain of the world; the lift and run
of the flying clouds; the great scent of
green summer rain ; the joy of warm life in
the white sun ; the laughter of young chil-
dren far down in a yellow valley ; the glory
of woman’s beauty that comes over a strong
man like a mist full of small singing stars;
the morning look of flowers when the honey
is in them; the long, dark marvel of birth
and death; the lapping of slow river waters
and the night anger of black seas with no
shore?. .. .Man, man, would you give it all
to me? Surely it is too great a gift lo
take! .
Kelly : Och, maybe it is for the likes ot
you it was meant. Take it with a man’s
kindness; for surely it is a great thing if
you can play it and miss the curse.
Mrs. Kelly: You will take it, surely,
stranger; for it is glad we will be to see it
going out at the door.
The Stranger: I will take it, surely.
He fingers the strings , and a faint, subtle
melody comes from the harp , which suddenly
changes to a ivild and curiously painful dis-
cord. .
Kelly: Och. what have I done? lis tne
fearful thing I have taken from my own
shoulders to lay on yours; for, surely, it is
no music you make, but a bad sound like
the breaking of the curse itself.
Mrs. Kelly : Och, can you not take it
away, young man, and learn somewhere to
play it? —for you started right, and the first
sound was sweet.
Kelly: No, but will you give it to some
older man that can maybe play it? ’Tis
little you have touched it yet, and the curse
is light on you still.
The Stranger: I will give it to no other
man till I make the Great Music or die in
the trying. But the wonder will not die in
the old strings ; for another will take it when
I fail, and another after him ; and the Great
Music will be heard at last.
Kelly: ’Tis little fear you have, surely.
The Stranger : Man, I do fear. There
is a fear upon me this night like the cold
thing that creeps out of the dark mist and
sets its two thin hands on your hot heart
when you hear a voice like a small child
crying far out on the black bogs, and know
that there is no living child there. There is
a fear upon me like the sharp wind in the
cold morning before the sun with one small
star only, and it setting, when the whispers
come up out of the grass and say the fear-
ful words that no living man may under-
stand, but the dead tremble at when they
turn a little in their graves to hear the
black sods above their heads speaking to
the Something below that knows the worst
of all. ,
Mrs. Kelly shudders and breaks into a
low wailing. Kelly moves away from the
stranger and pokes the turf fire into a blaze.
There is a moment's tense silence.
Kelly ( hoarsely ) : Do you give it back to
me, and I will walk through all the green
world till I find a man that has no fear at
all. ,
The Stranger: llow would there be the
Great Music without the great fear? Will
I give it up? You have set it in my hands,
and I will yield it to no man while there is
life in me to seek to be its master and its
slave. I am not afraid of a curse that is
only a curse of death. It is the curse of life
I fear; to hold in my hands the treasure of
song, and, maybe, never to make the Great
Music. , , ~
Mrs. Kelly : ’Tis you have the bold
heart.
Kelly: ’Tis you, surely, will lift the
curse with a fine stroke of your long fingers ;
for you are the brave man.
The Stranger : I will go now. Good-
night to you, my friends. If I die, you will
never know ; but if I make the Great Music
you will hear it where you are. It will
come down the wind and out of the sky and
across the rivers and loughs, and you will
feel it in your own hearts and understand
what it is. Och. Ireland, my country, you
are a grave where a dead man dreams long
in his shroud; but the resurrection and the
life is come! Och, my ten fingers, my ten
fingers! Is it the Great Music for you?
Is it the Great Music for you?
He goes out. and as he passes through the
door the night wind breathes on the harp
and sends out a long, low strain of triumph.
