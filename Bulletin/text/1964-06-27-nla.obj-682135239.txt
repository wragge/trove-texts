“PATRICK WHITE’S OPERA”
Sir,
I believe an article has appeared in
your paper under the heading “Patrick
White’s Opera”. I should like to say at
once that the announcement is prema-
ture and inaccurate. lam not working
on an opera, I may not work on an
opera, but if I do, it will be known as
Sculthorpe’s opera; no libretto was ever
more than the peg on which to hang the
coat.

CORRECTION
Sir,
Sieg heil and all that rot —damn scan-
dalous all this nonsense I read about
myself. I shall inform you now, as I
have informed the stormtroopers in the
past, I have not been convicted of 22
crimes; I have been, in fact, convicted of
56. You were only partially right; I had
been convicted of 22 crimes by the time
I was 18 years of age. Please correct
this matter in your next edition. Should
you not be prepared to do this my
“dozen” stormtroopers and I will come
down and put Zyclon “B” in your water
supply.
We grant you this —we need publicity
and could not thrive without it. You
know it and we know it.

STATE AID
Sir,
In his letter on the subject of State Aid
to Schools (13/6/64) Mr Bernard Martin
was not aware that the original letter
published in part in a previous issue was
distributed to all Federal parliamentari-
ans and dealt largely with the consti-
tutional legality of using “public money”
for denominational schools. Our claim
that “the State schools are in need of
help” was directed to parliamentarians in
the belief that it is within their power to

correct it. This society holds that the
community in its present state of afflu-
ence can adequately provide and that
the existing state of affairs is due to
several factors, one of which is mis-
management.
It is our belief and that of many
others that to make a law to give money
to any religion for education or any
other purpose is towards establishing
religion and therefore contravenes Sec-
tion 116 of the Constitution. The Sec-
tion has not been challenged on these
grounds in Australia before and many
people are not properly aware of its
significance.
If Mr Martin has studied English his-
tory he would realise the threat to the
freedom of religion where there is an
establishment of any particular religion
or sect. He could also learn the fate of
minority sects where there is a State
religion.

[Section 116 reads in part: “The Com-
monwealth shall not make any law for
establishing any religion . . .”]
Sir,
Bernard Martin’s letter manages to
evade the crucial point by the usual
objectionable double talk which has to
be used when no reasonable argument is
to hand.
The term “public money” is quite
justifiably used in this context. All
parents in Australia are entitled to the
education provided for their children by
the State in State schools. Consequently
parents who for any reason opt for a
private school education for their child-
ren can hardly claim to be a poor per-
secuted section of the community. They
reject their rights by choice.

“ILLEGAL APPARATUS”
Sir,
The article “Inside the Communist
Party”, by Fred Wells (13/6/64), de-
monstrates the professional zeal applied
by the party in its endeavors to weaken
every facet of our social system.
One item in the very interesting or-
ganisational chart of the party is quite
intriguing. This is the “Illegal Appara-
tus ” section under the jurisdiction of the
Disputes Committee. Just what consti-
tutes “Illegal Apparatus”? As the party
proudly claims to be a legitimate politi-
cal party, protesting loudly its right to
exist along with other political organisa-
tions, perhaps Mr Wells, as a former CP
member, would be good enough to ex-
plain this apparent contradiction from
his knowledge of this peculiar section
which has such sinister implications. It
certainly warrants an explanation which
was not forthcoming in his article.

FILMS; “NO LOCK-OUT”
Sir,
In Batman's “Around Melbourne”
dealing with the Film Festival (13/6/64)
the following statement appears: “Local
theatres, too, have staged almost a com-
plete lock-out”.
I do not know whether he means by
this that (a) local theatre proprietors
have refused to make their theatres avail-
able for the purpose of the Film Festival
or (b) local theatre proprietors have re-
fused to screen foreign films of the type
shown at the Festival. If he means (a)
then he simply does not know what he
is talking about. Any number of local
theatres could be made available for
the purpose of the Film Festival if the
conditions of entry of the films in ques-
tion into Australia permitted those films
to be shown to a larger number of
people.
If he means (b) he should be assured
that any foreign film which has any rea-
sonable chance of successful commercial
exhibition in this country will certainly
be imported and screened here. If, how-
ever, a film has very little chance of
making money, then it is obviously not
a sound proposition for the distributor
(importer) to pay the substantial import
duty, primage, etc., on that film.
Whichever meaning he intended, the
suggestion of a “lock-out” is ridiculous,
and shows a complete lack of knowledge
of the film industry in Australia.

ABORIGINES RIGHTS BILL
Sir,
Your editorial “New Look at New
Guinea” (30/5/64) makes reference in
its opening paragraphs to the Northern
Territory’s Aborigines Rights Bill having
been enacted. It is surprising to find a
journal such as yours so ill-informed as
to refer to a piece of legislation which
has never existed. I presume the refer-
ence was intended to be to the Social
Welfare Bill which passed all stages at
the meeting of the NT Legislative
Council held last month, and which now
awaits the Royal assent before becoming
law. Whether it does, in fact, receive
that assent depends on whether the
Government is prepared to accept
amendments introduced by members of
the Council other than official Govern-
ment members.
Your editorial claims that the Bill does
not automatically “solve the many
problems of the Aborigine”. It would
have been happier wording had it said
that the Bill did not automatically solve
all the problems of the European popu-
lation of the Territory, for assuredly it
will be the Europeans rather than the
Aborigines who will be faced with the
problems. The Social Welfare Bill, in
essence, grants nothing to anybody, but
by virtue of the fact that one clause
providing for the repeal of the Welfare
ordinance removes restrictions which
have previously been imposed on people

NEW
ROAD
TO
MANDALAY
In the rugged gorges of the Avon Valley, north-east of Perth, men and machinery are carving a new
highway from the rock-studded earth. There is an excitement, a sense of urgency about their work, for
this will be a segment of the transcontinental standard gauge railway line that will link South Brisbane
to the port of Fremantle.
New road to Mandalay? Yes, and more than
that ... a new highway to the export markets of
the world; for along this way will pass increasing
volumes of manufactured goods and primary pro-
duce to supply the needs of the growing Afro-Asian
markets.
The recently completed Melbourne-Sydney
standard gauge line demonstrates the value of
railways in the mass volume transportation of
goods at high sustained speeds, and at rates no
other form of land-based transport can match.
The current building of the Broken Hill-Port Pirie
link, and that between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle,
is a further vote of confidence by Australia in the
destiny of her railways. A transcontinental railway,
of common gauge, will prove the broad and
enduring road down which the nation will progress
to an even greater future.

of pure Aboriginal blood. Protection
and assistance for those who need it,
whether they be of Aboriginal or other
blood, still remain. So that the repeal
of the old Welfare ordinance might be
made effective, the Government intro-
duced at the same time as the Social
Welfare Bill other Bills intended to
amend a host of other ordinances which
were dependent on the Welfare ordi-
nance.
One vital factor which should be
remembered by observers in southern
States is that all the problems with which
the new legislation hopes to deal are
those associated with Aborigines—NOT
half or quarter castes or any people of
mixed blood but purely and simply the
full-blood Aborigines.

BLACK & WHITE
Sir,
In your issue of June 6, Les Tanner
asks What’s Happened to Black &
White? The question is answered in
the pages of The Bulletin today— not
a worthwhile humorous drawing. The
illustrated jokes were an attractive fea-
ture of the old “Bully”. The reproduc-
tions on pages 38 and 39 do them far
less than justice: a poor selection. If
there were a market for humor expressed
in black and white there would be no
lack of sellers.

“RED UNIVERSITIES”
Sir,
In his article on “Red Universities”
(13/6/64) your correspondent claims it
was the intention of “The Crucible” to
expose “Communist infiltration of Aus-
tralian universities”. As editor of that
particular issue of the ANU Labor
Club s broadsheet, since resigned on a
matter of principle, I would like to
emphasise that the concern of the
article was with events in the Society
for the Study of Labor History. It was
The Bulletin, not “Crucible”, that
mentioned the academic posts of those
referred to in the article.
Further, your correspondent's concern
with the article's intentions and with its
supposed reflection on the motives of a
number of academics contrasts greatly
with the clarity of the points made and
the documentary evidence quoted in
“Crucible’. When your correspondent
does come finally to state what were the
facts of the situation, there also he is in
great error.
It is simply untrue to say that the
Sydney chairman. B. Nairn, "recognised
some months ago that an attempt had
been made by the Communists to seek
influence in the ASSLH. The fact that
B. Nairn had denied these attempts, and
that on this point E. C. Fry, R. A. Gol-
lan and J. Hagan agreed with him, was
the reason for the Sydney meeting in
the first place. On May 21, Nairn had
met Gollan in Sydney, where Gollan
had emphatically denied any Communist
moves, and so Nairn continued to refuse
to entertain information from Canberra
to the contrary.
On another count, it is clearly untrue
to state that while Fry, Gollan, Nairn,
McFarlane, Wells and Hagan were meet-
ing in Sydney, “Crucible” was only
then being printed. Two copies of this
“Crucible” were sent the day before to
F. Wells, the Sydney secretary. Steps
were taken to ensure Wells got a copy
by that afternoon, and, furthermore, the
contents of “Crucible” were communi-
cated to Wells verbally at 4.45 p.m.
Wells’ questioning at the meeting on
Saturday, May 30, would obviously be
influenced by the evidence “Crucible”
contained and by the knowledge that it
was in print.
What happened at the Sydney meet-
ing your correspondent does not com-
mit himself on. What were the decisions
made that in any way alters the situa-
tion outlined in “Crucible”?
To conclude, it is a sad day when
the publication of a documented case
about Communist attempts at control
of a body such as the ASSLH should be
characterised as “verging on McCarthy-
ism”, and when those who find them-
selves at odds with the case presented in
“Crucible should not feel any compul-
sion to answer it point for point.

JOHN POPE HENNESSY
Sir,
The review by Geoffrey Scott of
Verandah by James Pope-Hennessy
(14/4/64) was of considerable interest to
Queensland historians principally be-
cause no reference can be found in the
Queensland State archives, or in any
other Government papers and documents
of the Executive Council, to the appoint-
ment of Sir John Pope Hennessy as
Governor of Queensland and to the can-
cellation of his appointment because
Queenslanders objected to a Catholic
governor.
Some weeks ago I wrote to the Public
Record Office in London, asking whether
they could provide verification of the
statements made in the biography. I
have received a reply from "that office
advising that no mention of Governor
Pope Hennessy is made in the Colonial
Office Records (Queensland) in the Pub-
lic Record Office. The office approached
Mr James Pope-Hennessy and he sup-
plied extracts bearing on the purported
appointment which the Record Office
enclosed with the letter. These included
extracts from his grandfather's private
papers, and from "the Colonial Office
Records (Mauritius) in the Public Record
Office. The letter stated: “Mr Pope-
Hennessy also believes that he found a
further distinct reference in one of the
Mauritian newspapers when he was
working on the archives in Port Louis,
but could not find his note.”
There does not seem to be any doubt,
on the available evidence, that the offer
of Lord Kimberley to Sir John Pope
Hennessy of the Governorship of
Queensland was made and accepted.

National Notebook
Long Hair
Tn our day, of course, a long-hair was
a classical musician. Such as Mr
Artur Rubinstein. When we talked to
Mr Rubinstein a few days ago he was
lamenting that his hair supply was quite
meagre by the standards of today. How-
ever, Mr Rubinstein at 75 seemed pretty
remarkable in every way.
Mr Rubinstein is making his first visit
to Australia for nearly 30 years and it
is a literal fact that he was whisked out
of Sydney within 24 hours so that his
visit would not coincide with the return
of the Beatles. It was inevitable that at
every turn he was asked what he thought
of the English singing group, but
although Mr Rubinstein is a lively con-
versationalist, on the Beatles he could
merely say with most of us that he knew
they had long hair but he couldn’t find
out what they did.
Mr Rubinstein is tolerant of most
types of music, “as long”, he said, “as
it is invented music”. But he has waged
a lifelong war against plagiarising the
classics.
“Why should someone get a million
dollars for stealing?” he demanded.
“And for doing something
that I could do when I
was four. At four I could
take a theme of Mozart
and turn it into a waltz
tum-di-di, tum-di-di
and all I got as a reward
was a piece of chocolate.”
Mr Rubinstein recalled that in 1920 he
began collecting signatures on a petition
to ask the US Congress for legislation to
bar plagiarising classical music. “Then
Tin Pan Alley struck,” he said, “They
said, if you sign that petition, you will
have no more concert bookings, no
orchestras, no income. So one by one
supporters dropped away and I was left
with my cause.”
Mr Rubinstein admitted that he was
under no financial necessity to perform
now, although he felt money was never
the first consideration. “Often I have
forgotten to pick up the cheque,” he
said. But although it was nice to come
to 75, be feeling well, eating well and
sleeping well and have a seven-year con-
tract ahead of you, he was inclined to
think that suffering was the hallmark
of supreme genius. “Think of Mozart,
dead of starvation at 36,” he said.
“Think of Schubert! But then I think
of Paderewski. He was a fine pianist,
had a long life and died wealthy.
Wealthier than I am, because that was
before income tax took 90 per cent of
your money.”
Soapless
Suddenly this month some thousands
of Sydney housewives were cut off
from their “source” of daily opiate, the
radio serials. Only the ABC’s “Blue
Hills” escaped the attention of the
narcosis squad, and it appears that no
station escaped the wrath of the addicted,
who telephoned all around to complain
to anyone who would listen.
It was fitting that the deserialisation
should have occurred the week the
Beatles arrived, because we understand
that they had quite a bit to do with it.
Some time in the past year, as the
Beatles did earlier, one Sydney radio
station put on a new front, adopted the
personality of a harmless “good guy”,
and played rock and roll to the teen-
agers until it ran out of their ears.
The result was a dramatic leap from
midway to the top in the ratings, and
as nothing is more likely to be copied
than success, the station with the serials
threw them out in favor
of, among other things,
more of the Beatles and
whoever their successors
may be.
However, the removal
of Sydney’s last serials is
not the end of the world,
as suggested by Richard (“Autumn
Affair”) Lane, president of the Radio,
TV and Screen Writers’ Guild, when
he stated that it would be a death blow
to the whole industry, affecting produc-
tion companies, actors and script writers.
Sydney is not the whole of Australia.
The serials will continue to be heard in
other States, in the country, and in New
Zealand. Some are exported even
further. If the Sydney action leads to
anything, it may be something better
than the eternally ruminative soap
operas. Already some of the stations
are planning better music, more public
affairs programmes, and a more intelli-
gent and intelligible sound.
Somewhere in that area there would
seem to be room for production com-
panies, actors and script writers to con-
tinue their industry, on a higher level,
and not necessarily in expensive studios
with built-in fake sound effects. Speak-
ing of radio commercials, but with a

possible idea for the industry, an
American expert has remarked that
much of the future lies in the possibility
of “a couple of talented guys fooling
around with a tape recorder”.
It is hard to join in any regrets for
the recession in the soap opera business.
In fact it seems one- good reason to wel-
come the Beatles.
However, 2CH later capitulated, and
announced it would “test the market” by
running two serials, which had been
broadcast before, five times weekly.
Enthusiasm
PFhere was a time, long before the
A Australian invasion of every repub-
lic, principality and monarchy of Europe
began, when the more lowly State border
inspectors mistook the designation “Aus-
tralian” for “Austrian”. The former was
a remote spot somewhere “down there”,
Austria they understood; Mozart, Strauss,
Alt Wien . . . Today the Australian over-
seas image is an inflated one and not
only Neville Cardus believes we live in
a world of art and the classics.
But that we should ever grow to
closely know the Austrian Republic is,
on the face of it, a more remote possi-
bility. If we do not, galvanic Austrian
Consul-General Gerhard (Gery) Richard
Felser will feel sorely at fault, and he is
not a man who takes failure easily.
Besides ministering to fellow expatri-
ates, he has brought a near missionary
zeal to the more formidable task of
developing local enthusiasm for things
Austrian. Since he came to this country
in 1938, he has been an ardent propa-
gandist for Austria. Recently his
government rewarded him with one of
the highest national honors for pro-
moting friendship between Austria and
Australia.
Besides his work as Consul administer-
ing to 5000 Austrians in NSW and terri-
tory to the north, he runs a thriving
business as public accountant, produces
two or three plays a year for a German
language theatre group (and has done
since 1942), collects stamps which won
him a silver medal at the Melbourne
International Philatelic Exhibition, makes
and produces short films and is an en-
thusiastic radio ham, operating station
VK2ZGF.
Peak achievement in his bid to bring
cultural exchanges between the two dis-
similar nations was the formation in
1942 of the Austrian-Australian Cultural
Society, which has Sir Charles Moses as
patron and honorary president.
He hopes to visit Austria soon to
begin work on the Austrian activities of
the society and he expects local support
can bring about creation of the Austrian
counterpart with very little difficulty.
But he is equally enthusiastic about the
country of his adoption. “I arrived here
with 10s. in my pocket and there was
no migration scheme to help us in those
days,” he said. “I’ve done very well,
and that despite the fact people were
not as tolerant as they are now.”
He finds Sydney still lags behind
Vienna in sophisticated living. “But it
would be impossible to imagine anything
else. What is remarkable is the great
progress already made. The wine cel-
lars here serve food and wines very
close to the quality of those to be found
in most places in Europe these days. And
one refreshing thing—the Australians
have never become snobs about it.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Dreamworld of Labor
TTIE Labor Party is in a mess for
A which there are a number of ex-
planations. Each of the factions
now fighting so bitterly and in-
effectively for power within the
ruins of a once great movement
has its own particular theory to
which it clings with stubborn
ferocity. In the absence of a
modern, professional party sec-
retariat, which might apply itself,
among other things, to a scientific
study of the reasons for the party’s
sad decline in power and prestige,
one guess looks as good as another.
Those looking for answers might
have found one by spending 25
shillings on a ticket to the New
South Wales ALP Ball held in
Sydney’s baroque Town Hall the
night before the ALP’s annual
conference. At this scarcely glitter-
ing reception in the heart of Labor’s
one remaining mainland strong-
hold, the NSW Premier, Mr Ren-
shaw, stood dutifully at the end of
the hall to receive debutantes. This
rather pathetic, second-hand social
exercise indicates all too clearly the
flabby state of the ALP which Mr
Calwell later described as the party
of revolution.
The plain fact is that the ALP
is not a party of revolution and
has not been one for a very long
time. It is now a conservative party
and on certain issues it is a party
of reaction.
It wants to preserve a society in
which the unions have won a place
of privilege, in which farmers and
manufacturers shelter behind a
tariff wall to share the loot with
their employees, in which the sort
of girls and boys from the industrial
suburbs who were presented to Mr
Renshaw can join the affluent
society in striving for bigger and
shinier cars, for more costly and
more comfortable homes.
There is nothing wrong in
wanting cars and houses or in
wanting bigger and better ones. But
there is something wrong with say-
ing that you want a social,
political and economic revolution
when you clearly want something
a good deal less. Like those who
suffer from schizophrenia the party
has lost contact with its environ-
ment. And as comfortable as
many find their Labor dreamworld,
it offers only immanent satisfac-
tions.
Where are the boundaries of
Australian politics today? Where is
Labor’s New Frontier? Not in
nationalisation. Even if some in
the Labor Party mean what they
say, there is every reason to
believe that Mr Calwell has sold
that pass. It was no great loss.
Labor Party planners can no longer
believe in rescuing the working
class from poverty, for affluence
and acceptance of the welfare state
by all political parties have already
seen to that. Those areas of
poverty still to be mopped up are
marginal. A party of progress
let alone revolution! has to find
something better than a thirty-year-
old plan for dealing with a situa-
tion that no longer exists.
T'HERE is a good deal of progress
A being made in Australia in
fields like racial and religious toler-
ance, in learning to live in an ex-
citing new sort of society where
many people will have vocations
rather than jobs, in accepting and
enjoying the leisure which is the
fruit of our technology. Increasing
numbers of Australians now have
the sophistication and cultivation
of taste —and the money to indulge
it —previously possessed by only a
minority.
But who leads the way into this
brave new world? Not the Labor
Party. It pushes hard for Aborigines,
but boggles at any other colored
skin. What could be more schizoid
than a political platform which
denies racial prejudice or any sug-
gestion of racial superiority but
insists on retaining the offensive
label “White Australia”? The
ALP is the only party in Aus-
tralia which still retains the phrase.
Who gives a lead in toleration
of religious differences, in positively
encouraging differences in the
recognition that it is the right of
free men to differ? Not the Labor
Party. When the New South Wales
Labor Party took one tentative step
towards State Aid, the Federal
Executive rushed to Sydney to stop
it. Sir Robert Menzies’ reputation
for catching the tide is undoubtedly
well earned. But what did he have
to beat?
And so the story goes on. We
already know enough about the
effects of automation to realise that
another industrial revolution is upon
us. The Labor Party talks about
automation, but where are the
pamphlets which will educate pub-
lic opinion, the trade union leaders
who have educated themselves and
their political counterparts by in-
tensive study and are in turn
educating their rank and file?
Where are the detailed blueprints
for the changes to come in the way
in which we earn our livings? It
should be an exciting prospect, a
chance for most people to avoid the
drudgery of the past, but Labor sees
only threats to established skills
and entrenched privilege. Instead
of Labor leaders we are offered
Luddites.
Saddest of all is the spectacle of
Labor’s young adherents—the men
and women who will compete for
the right to govern in 2000 AD —
entertaining tawdry ambitions and
second-rate ideas. Of all people
they need a cultivated taste, a sense
of what our society has to offer. It
boils down to providing people with
a choice, to allowing them a chance
at all the alternatives; it means
working for cultural as well as
social mobility. If the Labor Party
could stop keening about the
deprivations of the past it might
more profitably turn to the needs
of today.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ALP
Premier Renshaw
Speaks Out
NSW stands alone?
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
F. E. CHAMBERLAIN
Warned off
Tndications emerged from the Queen’s
Birthday weekend NSW ALP Con-
ference that NSW is preparing to fight
back against the disastrous ALP Federal
control which has helped keep Labor
out of office federally for 15 years, and
reduced NSW to the lone Labor Govern-
ment on the Australian mainland.
Premier Renshaw only thinly disguised
his antagonistic feelings towards the form
of present Federal control in his address
to the conference. He commended the
view that Federal Labor leaders, Mr Cal-
well and his deputy Mr Whitlam, should
be at Federal ALP Conference and exe-
cutive meetings with full voting rights—
a view which Conference overwhelm-
ingly endorsed.
But he went much further. In an
oblique but unmistakable “Hands off
NSW” warning, he said bluntly: “From
time to time there has been intrusion by
Federal Executive in matters strictly of
State concern.” Obviously he was think-
ing of 1963 when, armed with Federal
Executive authority, Federal ALP
“strong man” Mr F. E. Chamberlain
from Western Australia, the ALP Federal
Secretary Mr Cyril Wyndham, and ALP
Federal President Mr J. Keeffe marched
into NSW to tell the State Government
that, in helping parents in low income
brackets with children at private schools,
NSW was breaking Federal policy which
opposes State aid for denominational
education.
“Somewhere along the line I believe
we should determine where responsibili-
ties start and where they finish in rela-
tion to the States and Commonwealth on
a Federal Executive level,” said Ren-
shaw coldly. “Last year we saw a situa-
tion where, in determining Federal
policy, decisions were made contrary to
State legislative enactments involving
State funds. I suggest that . . . Federal
Executive should make determinations
on policy only to the extent they relate
to the Federal Government’s responsi-
bility in the matter of making funds
available.
“But when State funds are used for
any purpose—education or health or any
activity of government—then it becomes
the responsibility of State Governments
and State Executives.”
Renshaw is no fool. Though com-
paratively young, he has been in associ-
ation with the ALP hierarchy, both
Federal and State, for a long time.
So Renshaw went a protective step
further. He threw into the brawl one
of his most capable operators, NSW
Attorney-General Reg Downing, an old,
shrewd fox of Labor politics, who is
credited with being one of the major
behind-the-scenes factors in keeping
Labor in power in NSW for more than
20 years. He did this by having Downing
nominate for a position on the delega-
tion of six which represents NSW at
Federal conferences. As might be ex-
pected with such backing, Downing won
a position as one of six.
With Downing on the,NSW delegation,
NSW ALP President Mr C. T. (“Char-
ley”) Oliver (who has fought NSW’s
battles in both the Federal ALP Con-
ference and ALP Executive for years,
often with the odds heavily against him)
will be in a much stronger position. An
AWU official, Oliver is tough and stub-
born. But he has been up against ruth-
less men, who have gone to lengths to
thwart him and the NSW viewpoint, and
he has needed ruthless, able assistance
to match their manoeuvres.
Paradoxically, however, NSW could be
starting to fight back at a period when
its Federal power could be at its lowest
ebb in recent years. Hitherto South
Australia has generally tended to support
NSW on ideological issues such as unity
tickets in trade union ballots.
But when South Australia rejected the
proposal that NSW overwhelmingly en-
dorsed, that Mr Calwell, Mr Whitlam
and the Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party be given representation and voting
rights on the Federal ALP Conference,
it suggested that South Australia is
moving Leftwards.
Whether, even with Downing on its
delegation, NSW has the strength to
combat the present domination of the
Federal ALP by the Leftist States
Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia
and possibly now South Australia re-
mains to be seen.
BEER
The Commonwealth and
Carlton United
Restrictive practices at Jindera?
From a Melbourne Correspondent
HThe Commonwealth Attorney-General,
Mr Billy Snedden, cast his shadow
over Victoria's Royal Commission into
the Liquor Industry last week.
His"interest in the proceedings became
apparent when the Royal Commissioner,
Mr P. D. Phillips, QC, heard an appli-
cation from Mr L. F. Fowler, of the
Commonwealth Crown Solicitor’s office,
for a copy of the transcript of evidence
given by a Jindera (NSW) publican
early in June. Mr Fowler, however, was
unable to give any reason for his
department’s application. He said he had
no instructions as to the reason for the
request.
Mr Phillips said that his instructions
from the Victorian Treasury seemed to
exclude anyone other than parties to
an inquiry from receiving copies of the
transcript. He said he had already re-
fused a similar application from a tem-
perance organisation, although he knew
of their interest in the matter. He said
he based his refusal on the grounds that
they were not parties to the inquiry.
Mr Phillips characterised the applica-
tion by Mr Fowler in these terms: “I
want to apply for a copy of the tran-
script. I am not in a position to say
what my interest is or why I want it.”
In the circumstances he felt obliged to
refuse the request, but he agreed to an
application by Mr Fowler to reserve the
matter so that it could be reviewed at
a future date.


Jindera is just over the border, near
Albury, in an area which traditionally
receives its • beer supplies from Mel-
bourne, or more particularly from Carl-
ton and United Breweries. Mr Rowan,
who owns the hotel there in partnership
with his wife, appeared at the Royal
Commission early in June and described
the CUB manager, Mr R. G. Fogarty, as
an “irascible, pedantic dictator”. He told
Mr Phillips that when he took over the
hotel in August, 1962, a brewery repre-
sentative explained that he would have
until Wednesday to pay for beer de-
livered on the previous Friday. Soon
afterwards a guarantee form arrived
from the brewery’s chief accountant
asking him to provide a guarantor for
£325, this sum being based on a normal
three weeks’ supply of beer to his hotel.
On legal advice Mr Rowan rejected
the form on the grounds it was super-
fluous under the credit terms on which
he was buying his beer. Instead he
offered to leave a cheque for £325 with
the brewery but was told by its chief
accountant, Mr P. R. Power, that this
was not acceptable. He was told that
even if he entered into the guarantee, he
would still not receive beer supplies if
he had not paid for the previous week’s
supply by Wednesday.
At this stage Mr Rowan intimated
that he would get beer from other
sources. He said he was then told that
CUB had a trade agreement with the
breweries in NSW under which they
would not supply each other’s customers.
In April, 1963, his beer supplies were
cut off by CUB and Mr Rowan kept
going by buying beer from other publi-
cans. Since April of this year he had
been able to obtain beer from Miller's
in Sydney under a temporary arrange-
ment.
Last week Mr Phillips, who has been
hearing evidence from CUB, said that he
did not consider there were any grounds
for criticising CUB over its credit terms
to hotel-keepers. There were, he said,
many matters on which he had reserved
his opinion because of the likelihood
that further evidence would be presented.
However, after hearing from Mr Power
and CUB’s sales manager, Mr A. W.
Wootton, he was satisfied on this issue,
and on the terms relating to the return of
spoiled beer.
Mr Phillips said that the evidence
showed that less than three-tenths of
one per cent of CUB beer was returned
to the brewery with claims for spoilage.
“This seems to me to demonstrate what
I think is the most bitter complaint which
the temperance forces have in Victoria
namely, that this brewery manu-
factures very good beer.”
TASMANIA
No Change in
the Orr Dispute
All the ingredients of a cliffhanger
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
S. S. ORR
Champerty
A mid the flurry of statements in the
quadrangle of the University of
Sydney on that late December afternoon
last year which seemed to mark the
end of the Orr affair, no one took much
notice of a suburban solicitor wearing
a Rotary badge. He was Don Champion,
Orr’s legal adviser, who had been kept
waiting outside during the day’s talks.
Mr Champion did suggest forcefully to
some reporters who lent him an ear
(until they discovered he wasn't a pro-
fessor) that the whole agreement was of
dubious legal validity.
The question now—months later —is
whether Mr Champion was right. This
year has been marked by intermittent
rumors that the whole settlement had
fallen through, but it was only last week
that the first public statement since
December dragged the affair back into
the public arena. It came from the
chairman of the Philosophers’ Associa-
tion, Professor Stout, in their journal.
Professor Stout’s article said that no
terms had been presented to the Philo-
sophers’ Association or the Staff Associa-
tions’ Federation, but that he had seen
those presented to Orr in January “which
have a place for the signatures of rep-
resentatives of the Philosophers and the
Federation, as well as for Orr’s sig-
nature”. These terms, according to
Professor Stout, were “materially dif-
ferent” from those submitted last
December and “one clause at least seems
of very doubtful legal validity”.
The statement did not give in detail
the objections, which come under three
headings. The first relates to the pre-
amble to the agreement which in the
philosophers’ view commits them to
agreeing to the notion that it is too late
to re-open the Orr case and thus to a
compromise on principle rather than
allowing them merely to note the pre-
amble as the University’s opinion.
The next two objections to the terms
as put forward come under two legal
headings. One arises out of the fact
that a withdrawal of Orr’s libel action
against the Vice-Chancellor, Professor
K. Isles —for statements in a pamphlet
that was part of the paper war over the
years—is laid down in the terms of
settlement.
has raised a fine legal point, so
-*■ fine that for many it is difficult to
see. Professor Stout hinted at it when
he said in the journal “we may not have
sufficient interest to take part in pressing
for a settlement of Orr’s claim . . . with-
out becoming entangled in the law
relating to maintenance”. In law “main-
tenance” and its relative “champerty”
have their origins in medieval practice.
They have come into currency in the
Orr case through the suggestion that
the Philosophers’ Association renders
itself liable to either civil or criminal
action for interfering in the Orr v. Isles
libel case.
The second possible legal objection is
that Orr cannot sign an agreement bind-
ing him not to apply for a job at the
University of Tasmania because it would
be a contract in restraint of his trade or
practice.
A compromise formula, alleged to be
approved by Orr, could solve the first
objection. The University of Tasmania
is now prepared to put forward a pre-
amble to the preamble which would say
“whereas on a certain day the University
did publish . . .” It is this point that
seems to pose the real problem of
principle in the hitches that have arisen
and if it could be established that the
agreement does not form a surrender by
the philosophers, it would be a major
step towards agreement.
The legal points are still open ques-
tions. One proposition put forward to
solve the deadlock over “maintenance
or champerty” is that there should be
five separate documents to be signed at
the same time instead of all parties
putting their signatures to one document.
(Maintenance and champerty are
probably paper tigers, even though they
have been discussed very seriously. The
Full High Court in March, 1961, in their
judgment on an appeal by Peter Clyne
cast severe doubt on “maintenance” as
an offence of any kind today when it
noted that the “reasons for its import-
ance (as a crime) disappeared centuries
ago”. The Full Court then questioned
whether or not maintenance as a civil

offence “ought not to be regarded as

The second legal objection to a con-
tract in restraint of trade or practice is
perhaps more complicated. Although
such contracts are common their validity
differs from case to case.
Legal objections aside, there is plenty
of gossip that the dispute was only a
delaying action to allow the libel case
to come forward and give Orr a chance
to gain damages that might exceed the
£16,000 settlement figure. On the other
hand, in the last few months there have
been suggestions that there was an
element of deliberate ambiguity in the
settlement proposals put forward by the
University of Tasmania last year.
But between the Stout article, the
official silence from Hobart and the new
University of Tasmania Council there
is some hope of fresh talks. However,
these are unlikely to come off before the
Council of the Philosophers meets in
August. The Orr case is neither re-
opened nor closed.
THE SERVICES
Behind the Pay Rises
The pension question still unsettled
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
the well handled publicity for
the pay rises covering Services per-
sonnel last week it might appear churlish
for anyone to ask questions about
Service conditions. But in the hangover
after the Thursday night celebrations
there were plenty of questions being
asked in the mess on Friday morning.
Firstly the statement of the Minister
for Defence, Senator Paltridge did not
give a hint of reform of the Defence
Forces Retirement Benefit Fund, which
has been a source of dissatisfaction rank-
ing equal with the concern over the pay
lag.
Nor, understandably, did the state-
ment give any clarification on the issue
of the right to resign while the High
Court decisions on the two outstanding
cases are pending.
The problem of resignations (and
there has never been any official denial
of claims that 1 in 20 Army officers
have their resignations in) had certainly
loomed large in the calculations of those
who worked out the rises. The most
substantial rises came in the late captain
and early major range where the heaviest
wastage of officers has been.
But at the same time, although the
rises were designed to counter that wast-
age, they showed a fundamental policy
change in the pay for more senior majors
and lieutenant - colonels. Where pre-
viously there were rises on 6, 8 and 10
years after promotion to captain or
major, now there are to be no rises
after 6 years unless there is promotion
to the higher rank.
The pay rises are, naturally, partly
liable to be eaten up by taxation and
by increased pension contributions. Rents
paid by Army personnel (up to 15 per
cent of salaries) will also help take up
part of the increase. Calculations showed
that, for some more senior captains, taxa-
tion, increased DFRB rates and higher
rents could cancel out increases.
The trouble at this stage is that in
the muddle of the DFRB scheme nobody
can be quite sure what his payments
under the increased salaries will be.
Under present systems of calculation,
senior majors and lieutenant-colonels are
likely to be confronted with drastically
increased DFRB payments but at the
same time they lose the old two-yearly
increments.
Even the offer on housing is less
attractive on examination, because one
of the main complaints on housing has
been its quality as well as its availability.
It takes only a little arithmetic to work
out that the average cost of a home on
figures supplied by Senator Paltridge
will be only £3913.
The rises are calculated to keep
an officer in the Service until his interest
in DFRB becomes too substantial for
him to risk its loss by resigning before
the normal retirement zone in his early
fifties. Certainly the other ranks come
out of the rises badly.
Their overall rise is £3 Is. lOd. but
that includes 19s. lOd. to cover the basic
wage rise recently. This will do nothing
to stop the wastage of sergeants and
warrant officers although it might help
with recruiting. In the controversy over
officers the very real problems of the
higher NCOs —traditionally regarded as
the backbone of the Army —in their
contributions to the DFRB has tended
to be overlooked. It is not uncommon
for a warrant officer to have to pay
£7 10s. a week out of a weekly salary
of £32 to ensure security after retire-
ment.
While the rise announced for Service
officers of the equivalent rank of major-
general was £9 a week in the Senator’s
statement, this did not take into account
the fact that on May 11 they got an
increase of £345 a year backdated to
December 23. Last week’s increases
were not backdated.
While the question of the DFRB re-
mains unsettled there will still be dis-
content among all ranks in the Services.
While the rises of last week go some
way towards settling the problems and
complaints of all ranks they show too
many signs of being hasty.
THE UNEMPLOYED
ffij&ulCetCa
80 Years Ago: June 28, 1884
For some time past the papers have
been full of the Unemployed.
We have watched their processions,
and heard the speeches at the Statue
and elsewhere. We also notice that
the Government has invented work
for them at five shillings a day. Now,
this paper is the last in the world to
speak hard of poor fellows who do
not know where to get the means of
earning bread. Howling vagabonds
make the speeches; loafing scoundrels
and a few poor hungry fellows make
up the crowd. There is no mistaking
the men who are there, eager to work,
but helpless, and the Sydney scum
eager for idleness—working hard so
as to do nothing. When the big pro-
cession filed up Hunter Street, the
gabblers were in front, the hard-up
men scattered here and there, and
the whole sprinkled with noisy vaga-
bonds, whose sour and villainous
faces we have noted for many a day
hanging round the wharves, or stand-
ing at opposite sides of a street,
whistling their thievish hints when a
country yokel or a tipsy civilian
heaves in sight. “Five bob a day ain’t
no good to me, says he. Should
think not. As long as there s a watch
t° g ra b, a drunkard, or a till, or a
clothes-line to rob what s five bob?
people sent by the Melbourne
“Age” to New Guinea on the
second expedition are the right sort
of explorers. They were not long
since attacked by cannibals, but
escaped. We mean the cannibals
escaped. And very lucky they would
think themselves if they knew as
much about Melbourne reporters as
we do.

UNIONS
Queensland’s
Industrial War
Both employers and employees?
From a Brisbane Correspondent
/Queensland is in the midst of its
** greatest industrial strife for at least
10 years and there is no end in sight.
Building trades, metal trades and rail-
ways are mostly affected by a strong
drive by unions for higher wages.
Last week, protest stoppages were
forecast for the building and metal trades
following inability of unions and em-
ployers to agree on union claims for a
£3 a week pay rise.
Union executives believe their mem-
bers are being paid much less in Queens-
land than in southern States. This has
been highlighted, they say, by the growth
of industry in Queensland and the
migration of many southern workers to
the State. It is claimed that the same
organisations are paying their employees
more in the south than they pay their
employees in Queensland.
The unions have an advantage over
employers in that there is a shortage of
tradesmen for the State’s burgeoning
industry. The unions, to a certain extent,
can call the tune, provided members
are willing to put up with loss of pay.
But many employers have contracts to
meet, and unions can play on this.
Stops in the middle of concrete pours
are common.
Earlier this month a compulsory con-
ference was adjourned after employers
had offered 225. 6d. a week for metal
tradesmen, instead of the £3 sought.
The Brisbane City Council was
brought into it last week when more
than 100 building trade workers em-
ployed by the Council marched on the
hall to see Labor aldermen. They saw
some rank-and-filers, but could not get
near some top aldermen who were in
the hall.
A shortage of key workers like
boilermakers is certain to be intensi-
fied as the construction work on two
big refineries at the mouth of the
Brisbane River gets under way.
The heat and bitterness on both sides
whipped up by a Communist-dominated
Trades Hall and the leadership of Gerry
Dawson, ACTU interstate executive
member and local boss of the Building
Workers’ Industrial Union, shows no
signs of subsiding.
Last month State Industrial Com-
missioner Harvey commented, “Let me
say without heat that both employers
and employees are doing an effective job
to destroy arbitration in this State.”


CENSORSHIP
No Challenge on
“The Group”
bat one on “The Song of the Red Ruby”
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
ARTHUR RYLAH
Standards
A fter many weeks, during which it
took legal advice and held lengthy
consultations with publishers and book-
sellers, Victoria’s Freedom to Read
Association has decided that it will not
try to initiate a test case around Mary
McCarthy’s novel, “The Group”. It
was the ban of this novel, and the public
debate surrounding it, which brought
about the flash-point leading to the
formation of the Association. Reluc-
tantly, therefore, the Association has
abandoned “The Group” and looked for
other fronts on which to challenge the
State’s obscenity laws.
These laws have already come into the
election campaign in a minor way. The
Labor Leader, Mr Stoneham, in his
policy speech, has promised support for
the establishment of a Censorship Board
on which both the Commonwealth and
the States would be represented, to-
gether with an Appeals Tribunal. Mr
Stoneham said that the control of litera-
ture should not be left to policemen or
politicians, but made no definite promise
to amend the existing law in Victoria.
On the Government side, the Chief
Secretary, Mr Rylah, has said that he
favored a uniform censorship code and
revealed that some talks had gone on
between Victoria and the Commonwealth
on the matter. Mr Rylah made this
statement on the eve of the election cam-
paign and emphasised that Victoria
would not abandon its standards merely
for the sake of uniformity.
The Association is taking advantage
of the election campaign to lobby the
main parties on the need for reform.
It is also planning a one-day conference
in September at which interested groups
will be able to put forward their views
on the obscenity issue. On the Associa-
tion’s committee it is felt strongly that
any bans on books should be the out-
come of hearings in a court or some
other public tribunal and not as a result
of action by either the police or the
Government of the day. Many members
also feel that a change in the legal de-
finition of obscenity is called for.
Legal opinions suggest that Victoria’s
definition of obscenity derives from that
laid down in the Hicklin case in England
some years ago. In the intervening
years, Britain and the United States have
considerably liberalised their concepts of
obscenity. Two British landmarks along
the way were the acquittals in the cases
against the publishers of “The Philan-
derer” and the Penguin edition of “Lady
Chatterley’s Lover”. The effects of these
decisions have obviously not flowed
through into Victoria, nor for that
matter into Australia.
Meanwhile, in the Melbourne City
Court last week, Miss Aileen Frances
Franklin, a Russell Street bookseller, was
charged under the Police Offences Act
with selling an obscene article, “The Song
of the Red Ruby”, by Agnar Mykle. She
was further charged with having 24
copies of the book and was ordered to
show cause why they should not be
destroyed.
Senior Constable Tunstall told the
court of how he had bought a copy of
Mykle’s book for 7s. 6d., and returned
later with other constables to seize the
remaining stocks of 24 copies. The
Crown Prosecutor, Mr A. E. Woodward,
said he would submit that the book
tended to deprave and corrupt members
of the community open to such influ-
ences, and that it placed undue emphasis
on matters of sex, thus constituting a
breach of Section 5 of the Police
Offences Act.
For Miss Franklin, Mr R. H. Dunn
submitted that detailed description of
sexual intercourse was an integral part
of the novel, “it is a book which gives
a message and can’t give a message with-
out a detailed description of sex,” he said.
When Mr Dunn said he intended to
call evidence from three prominent liter-
ary men, the case promised to be
interesting. However, the Magistrate,
W. M. Murray, SM, adjourned the hear-
ing until June 26 so he could read the
entire novel.
FOREIGN INVESTMENT
That £19.2 million
GMH Profit
£135m. in the Commonwealth kitty
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
HAROLD HOLT
Good points
/General Motors-Holden’s £19.2 mil-
lion profit last year made the headi-
est commercial reading for many a day
but Australian investors gnashed their
teeth at the thought of the £8.2 million
dividend which goes to the company’s
US parent. Local investors’ only con-
solations were that: The pay-off for the
parent was the lowest remittance since
1958; GMH’s best year yet swelled the
profits of its wide range of Australian
suppliers; the company’s ploughback of
£ll million together with its £7.3 mil-
lion depreciation for the year helped the
results of local companies assisting in
GMH’s huge expansion programme.
In a year when GMH’s annual over-
seas remittance was a drop in the ocean
of our balance of payments, the Federal
Treasurer, Mr H. E. Holt, could make
light of the view that the operations of
such overseas-owned companies impinged
on long-term prospects for the reserves.
Reserves are actually going gaily up
towards the £9OO million mark. But
there could come a time when the “Jot
of nonsense" Treasurer Holt says is
talked about overseas investment in
Australia could prove to be not such
nonsense after all.
Nonetheless, at a political meeting the
other night in Toorak, where most of
the audience looked to be investors, Mr
Holt made some good points on GMH's
handsome contribution to the Treasury
and to the economy in general. One
thing, he said, was that most overseas
developing countries competing for
foreign capital offer periods of tax-free
operations, whereas we do not. Since
it started in 1948, GMH has paid about
£135 million in taxes direct to the
Treasury and is paying Bs. company tax
on each pound of profits as well as heavy
withholding taxes on its overseas dividend
remittances. This is not to speak of the
revenue the Treasury derives indirectly
from the company’s profits in sales tax

LAW
In Search of
Justice
A 16-year fight for a fair price
From a Melbourne Correspondent
Mrs Jane Mudge, the Mildura widow
1 who successfully fought the Crown
to get fair compensation for her resumed
property, is dead, but the battle of her
fellow Mallee settlers to get equal
justice on their claims lives on. In one
way or another it has been proceeding
since 1948 when the Victorian Govern-
ment introduced a resettlement scheme
in the Mallee under which 88 settlers
forfeited their 600-acre blocks for the
miserly sum of £lO5O apiece.
In the end the Board of Lands
and Works awarded Mrs Mudge
£2937 10s. Id. for her two blocks, but
the strong Ex-settlers’ Committee says
this was accepted under protest as being
well below that required by the principles
laid down by Mr Justice Smith in his
Supreme Court judgment in her favor.
Since then 18 of the remaining 87 claims
have been settled, but, according to the
committee, on a similarly low basis.
Apparently, however, the legal titles of
these 18 were suspect on certain tech-
nical points and the Crown had indicated
it would contest each of these separate
claims if brought to court.
This leaves 61 of the original claims
still unsettled. Offers on a similar low
basis have been made on these by the
Board of Lands and Works but have
been turned down. In the view of the
Ex-settlers’ Committee these offers are
a third below the amounts required
under Mr Justice Smith’s principles, the
total shortfall on the 61 claims, in its
view, being around £lOO,OOO. It fails
to see any consistency between the
individual offers arrived at by the Board
and even suggests the variations may be
due to faulty arithmetic and in some of
the settled cases of non-committee mem-
bers to political pressures.
The committee wants the remaining
unsettled compensation claims taken out
of the hands of the Board of Lands and
Works and dealt with by a special
tribunal of two assessors, one nominated
by the Government and the other by
itself.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Lands,
Mr Turnbull, has written direct to the
various claimants offering compensation
on the terms already refused by the
committee, whose chairman, Mr J. M.
Curran, told me he also sees a ray of
hope in the possibility of an Ombudsman
being appointed to see justice done for
the victims of what he calls the “biggest
land grab in Australia’s history”.
Such an appointment may not be far
off. The Bolte Government has the
Parliamentary Statutory Law Revision
Committee working on it with the idea
of introducing the necessary legislation
in October. And in case Mr Bolte loses
the election, there is no more vocal a
supporter of an Ombudsman than Labor
Leader Mr Stoneham.
BUSINESS
Not Going
Far Enough
Restrictive trade legislation
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Tn the light of the Federal ALP’s
i reticence on the Barwick restrictive
trade practices proposals, it is surprising
to find Mr Stoneham so forthright in
their favor. His complaint is they won’t
go far enough and even that they will
not materialise. “If this proves the case
a Victorian Labor Government will
legislate against trade practices which
impose a penalty on business, the public
or the economy; collusive tendering will
also be stopped.” Again, he “would
honor the undertaking of the States’
Attorneys-General to pass uniform legis-
lation to control trade activities against
the public interest.”
Apparently Mr Stoneham, like Mr
Snedden, hasn’t been listening to the in-
formed public’s debate on this question.
The well-documented Victorian Labor
Leader’s policy speech touches the
business world at this and nearly every
other point with heavy anti-monopolist
overtones, growls about takeovers, com-
pany crashes, overseas capital and the
concentration of industry in the capital.
No reference to unemployment. Of
course, because there is none to speak
of. Its emphasis is on the uneven and
inequitable employment of material
resources.
There are plenty of good ideas mixed
in with the poor ones, some for the
redistribution of resources, some for the
employment of more resources. There
is no discussion, though, of inflationary
implications of the proposals or where
the additional resources, rather than the
finance, will come from.
In Mr Stoneham’s book a tougher
line than Mr Bolte’s in Canberra will
produce the money. He would outdo
Mr Bolte in parochialism, which is say-
ing something.
Mr Stoneham is at his best on de-
centralisation and would bend the whole
economy of the State in that direction.
He sees no merit in Mr Bolte’s efforts
in that direction, e.g., the planting of
Alcoa at Geelong, BP at Westernport.
The idea is right. But what of the
inducements Mr Stoneham would offer
to industry in the country. In one of
these, cheap finance from the State
Savings Bank, he neglects the hard
lessons of the Rural Bank in NSW as well
as the Bank’s own future as a Savings
Bank. His suggestions to equalise costs
by transport and other concessions have
not done the trick in attracting industry
to country areas so far, but more of
them might if the funds could be found.
Another, the establishment of industrial
estates, is good and so also is the idea
of joint State-private projects.

When you choose industrial rubber products durability
is of prime importance. Illustrated are seven striking
examples of the lasting qualities of Goodyear products.
But that is only part of the story. The
choice of a Goodyear product may
begin with many other aspects of its
use: extreme temperature conditions;
the need to withstand prolonged ex-
posure to weather; an unusual use
calling for a special design.
Goodyear meets such demands with
unrivalled world-wide experience in
industrial rubber. It comes to you
through the G.T.M. (Goodyear Tech-

OUT AND ABOUT
Pop Goes the Culture
Beatling around with the Beatles
By Our Reporters
In Melbourne Batman got the overall
picture of the Beatles’ visit:
There were many reasons why Mel-
bourne went berserk over the Beatles.
For one thing, they arrived on a Sunday,
and Queen s Birthday weekend at that.
t j ■ tvt
There is so little to do in Melbourne on
a Sunday that if anyone stood on his
head in Collins Street he would draw a
crowd of 5000.
Then, radio was quite a help. 3UZ
~ ~
more than a month ago started to whip
„ • r+ a. i 11 , c
up Beatlemama. It started all sorts of
„ .... T ,
Beatle competitions. It gave away 400
, D ' Ti
reserved tickets to Beatle concerts. It
„__ . _ .
gave away 100 pairs of eatle stockings
and 100 Beatle wigs. Sunday, June 14,
. , ~ , ,
always was described as B -Day, and
announcers were instructs to g.ve out
the slogan. 3UZ, Beatle Headquarters.
Then the grand training for field opera-
tions on B -Day was unbelievably
thorough. The staff began outdoor
rehearsals a fortnight beforehand until
everything was tested and perfect.
On the 24 hours of “B”-Day itself,
3UZ, “The Station with the Nicest
Listeners”, played 114 Beatle discs. To
cover the arrival they had 12 announcers
p , aced a|ong , he route; th had flve
f „, , .
mobile cars for broadcasting, plus a
Ct _ . , , .
Cessna alrcra , also broadcast,ng, to
f v ? “l 6 overaU P lcture ' Altogether 3UZ
had 40 outside technicians and an-
nouncers on the job.
_ , , , , , ,
But here s the point. Nobody knows
, , , J
how many people turned out to see the
_ tl / 1 F .
Beatles. Some say 300,000, but, if there
, ’
were that many, 200,000 had transistor
. a■ t n , .
radios. And as radio followed their
movements so the excitement built,
The climax came with the 15,000-
odd outsjde [he Southem Cross Hotel,
and nothing quite |ike , hjs has ever
happened in radio before. Don Lunn
0 f 3UZ had an outside broadcast
position at Ireland’s florist shop, right
opposite the Southern Cross. Now,
remember he was broadcasting, everyone
had transistors. He called out: “Can
you hear me out there?” Back came the
roar: “Yeah, we can hear you.”
So a conversation went on between
the announcer and his huge outside
audience. “Let’s all sing ‘WE LOVE
THE BEATLES’.” And so it went on,
“We Love John, We Love George, We
Love Ringo, We Love Paul.” Then
there was the announcement that they
were almost here. They were coming
round the corner. The excitement was
too much to stand and hysteria took
over.
The “Sun-News Pictorial” said that
350 were treated for fainting, hysteria
and minor injuries in the foyer of the
Southern Cross. Then the mounted
police came through, magnificent on
their greys, picking up swooning girls
here and there, laying their limp bodies
across the saddle. All this was on live
television, and it was maybe the best
show Melbourne has ever seen.
It all looked much more frightening
than it actually was. There were no
serious casualties, except that one lady
burst a blood vessel in her neck from
screaming too loud. Most of them were
treated by Dr Ivan Markovics, a Sydney
gynaecologist who was staying in the
hotel. He said he treated only one
girl who was genuinely ill. She was
suffering from exhaustion and lack of
food from sitting up all night. At least
25 per cent of the others thought faint-
ing was a magnificent way of getting
into the hotel to see the Beatles.
The Press conference, some 20
minutes later, was an embarrassing ex-
perience for the newspaper men and
women. For one thing they did not know
it was all being televised. For another
the Beatles had a deft habit of never
quite answering a question, and the
questions soon died. They were asked,
for example, were they worried by the
appalling scenes which had just taken
place in front of the hotel. “No,” said
John Lennon, “I’m only worried they
might stop.” Or this: “How do you
think Australian rock groups would go
in England?” Paul McCartney: “By
plane or boat, I suppose.”
But one devastating remark came from
John Lennon. A newswoman said:
“Why don’t you ask us some questions?”
“Yeah. If you have only three news-
papers in Melbourne, how come you get
50 or 60 at a Press conference?”
The crowd never quite left the front
of the Southern Cross. All day Mon-
day they were there, and they tried
desperate ruses to get in touch with the
Beatles. Some used a clever group
system. One would come on: “This is
long distance, one moment please . . .”
Another: “London, we are connecting.”
Another: “Would you mind waiting, Mrs
McCartney wants to speak to her son.”
The first show started in Festival Hall


at 6 p.m. Monday. The general opinion
among all critics was that the screaming
throughout was so loud it was impossible
to hear the music. “The Age” said the
prolonged scream was pitched somewhere
between an air-raid siren and an auto-
matic towel dispenser.
A newspaper cartoonist reported:
“Honestly, if a Boeing 707 had been
testing its engines at full power in Festi-
val Hall you wouldn’t have heard a
damned thing. In the end I couldn't
stand it. I stood up and shouted ‘SHUT
UP’. Then some bloke grabbed me by
the sleeve and said: ‘l'd sit down if I
were you, mate. If those sheilas in the
next row think you’re anti-Beatle they’ll
do ya’. I sat down.”
The next major performance was the
civic reception at Melbourne Town Hall,
and here again the Beatles received an
honor only accorded to Royalty. The
trams 1 stopped and Swanston Street was
blocked off for more than two hours.
Nobody actually fainted at the reception;
450 were present, and for the first time
in the 129-year-old recorded history of
Melbourne civic receptions the guests
squealed, giving out the classic auto-
matic paper dispenser noise. Four
potted shrubs were knocked over, the
Lady Mayoress was pushed to one side
while one female flung her arms about
Ringo, and from many a triumphant
matron there were cries of “I touched
him”.
★ ★ ★
T>ut for those interested in Beatle lore
there was an interesting phenomenon,
and it happened once before in London
at the launching of John Lennon’s book.
The Lord Mayor, Cr Curtis, said that
the night before, Paul McCartney had
attended a party, and for some consider-
able time he had impressed on a young
lady the fact that he couldn’t stand civic
receptions. The young lady happened to
be the Councillor’s daughter, so as an
act of penance he would call on them
to make speeches.
John said it wasn’t his turn, so he
asked Paul to take over. Paul said it
was a wonderful reception and dried up.
George mumbled four or five words of
thanks and Ringo’s speech in its entirety
was: “I wish you had the reception a bit
later instead of getting me out of bed
this early.”
As a performance it was most unim-
pressive. The one occasion when the
Liverpool sound turns into a beautiful
silence is when the Beatles are called
upon to make a speech.
★ ★ ★
Tn Sydney, Patricia Rolfe went, tongue
A in cheek, to the Press conference:
Like most of my generation I react
very strangely even when I hear the
Beatles’ name mentioned, much less
see their pictures in the papers or hear
them sing. It sounds awfully silly and
I do fight against it. But I don’t see that
it does such a great deal of harm,
although the psychologists say that it’s a
form of mass hysteria and gets pro-
gressively worse unless checked.
Of course, the youngies are always
criticising our generation but I feel that
if only they’ll have faith in us we’ll grow
out of it. The time for responsibilities
comes soon enough. By the time I’m
shuffling the cane chairs around on the
verandah of the old women’s home, I
won’t even remember who the Beatles
are.
★ ★ ★
I>ut at the moment I feel quite dif-
ferently. The Beatles are undoubtedly
the greatest thing that has happened to
pop. journalism since Malcolm Mug-
geridge began his Royal soap opera.
I only have to think about them to
begin babbling about the musicological
significance of their unresolved leading
tones. Or dreaming up a piece about the
sociological and psychological effect of
the Beatles on girls in the sub-teen
group. And I’ve discovered not only
Joycean rhythms and Lewis Carroll
echoes but Dostoyevskian overtones and
Brechtian undertones in John Lennon’s
“In His Own Write”. Given enough time
I’ll find nuances of the NSW Govern-
ment Railways Timetable in it.
Then I ask myself “Why is it that Sir
Alec Douglas-Home or alternatively
Mr Harold Wilson, or possibly Mr Joe
Grimond can rely on the Beatles to
win the British general election for
them, while this country hasn’t yet pro-
duced a guitar-player who could win
the Parramatta by-election for Menzies?
I ask myself that sort of question and
the answer I get is that Australia is
culturally immature and politically un-
sophisticated, and I could fill two pages
with that any day of the week. At the
moment I’m working on a piece drawing
parallels between the boyhood of the
Beatles and the growth of the Welfare
State, and tracing their sexual appeal
back to the orange juice and rose-hip
syrup they were issued as babies under
wartime rationing.
So humming a few phrases built
around unresolved leading tones, and
clutching a rolled-up copy of “Encoun-
ter” to ward off fans (theirs, not mine),
I hurried to the Beatles’ Press con-
ference at the Sheraton Hotel in Macleay
Street, Sydney, bent on a rewarding dis-
cussion on the mixolydian mode or the
significance of recent British by-election
results.
The room where the reception was
surged with the sort of journalists who
obviously don’t know an unresolved
leading tone from a Beatle’s foot. As
soon as the Beatles arrived, there was a
rush towards them. “Push, son, push,”
said that experienced Beatleman, disc-
jockey Bob Rogers. “You’ll never get
anywhere in life if you don’t push.”
As Paul McCartney said, it’s only the
oldies at the concerts who can’t hear the
music above the screaming. It was pretty
much the same at the Press conference.
The youngies could hear, simply because
they’re better trained in scrums and can
get themselves to the front quicker.
★ ★ ★
J asked Paul a pretty searching ques-
tion about the tendency of their
songs to precipitate the ear into a false
modal frame that temporarily turns the
fifth of the scale into the tonic, but he
apparently didn’t understand, or, as the
youngies would say, “dig”. He went on
talking to a heavy-breathing blonde
from one of the “Under 21” sections
about the secret of his sex appeal.
I could see there wasn’t much for me
there so I moved across to John Lennon
and asked him how he thought the
British elections would go. “I don’t
follow politics,” Lennon said. This
seemed a fairly interesting reaction, as
the election depends on him, but just
then a disc-jockey thrust a microphone
at him and remarked, with some origin-
ality, that the Beatles had had a wet
welcome. “I’ve never seen such rain in
my life,” said Lennon, “except in
Tahiti.” “Oh,” said the knowledgeable
disc-jockey. “Does it rain in Tahiti?”

Like little girls and ice cream, mod and aluminium packaging are natural partners
From baby foods to caviar, from orange juice
to cheese more and more good things to eat
and drink are being safely, attractively con-
tained in aluminium. The most delicate flavour
is perfectly preserved and the food is
guarded from vapour and moisture. The small
aluminium cap on your milk bottle forms an
attractive hygienic seal and foil-cooked foods
are more nutritious and flavoursome. With
beverages too, subtlety in flavour is all im-
portant— and overseas processers are now
specifying aluminium cans. Proud of their
product, they know that aluminium will pre-
serve natural goodness.
For over half a century, aluminium has been
used increasingly in food production, packag-
ing, capping and cooking. Aluminium utensils
are used extensively in hospitals and food
manufacturing plants throughout the world.
“Friendly to food” aluminium causes no dis-
coloration in food. It is unusually resistant to
fatty acids (a great advantage in handling
meats and oils). Aluminium is non-toxic and
carefully conducted tests prove that cooking
with aluminium (in contrast with certain other
metals) helps conserve vitamins. Food is kept
safely and cooked safely in hygienic aluminium,
truly the metal of the Twentieth Century.

By then I was rapidly running out of
Beatles. 1 approached George Harrison,
hoping to get something of sociological
significance, but another microphone
was thrust forward and a voice said:
“George, I’m Andrea and I do a pro-
gramme for the Mums and Dads. Would
you say hello to the Mums and Dads
for me?” So George said “Hello” for the
Mums and Dads.
The whole thing was pretty dispiriting.
Those of us who are working in the
overcrowded field of making popular
culture unintelligible to the masses must
ask ourselves: Do the Beatles take the
Beatles seriously enough? Do they under-
stand the significance of the Beatles? I
haven't got the answer yet, but when I
do I think I’ll get another article out
of it.

And Charles Higham went to the
concert at the Sydney Stadium:
All afternoon the Beatle crowds had
clustered in Macleay Street, defying the
people who flourished “We love you,
Artur Rubinstein!” banners with huge
red Beatle hearts. Tomatoes splashed
on the windows of the crammed student
cars which, honoring culture above
crude commerce, flaunted messages in
praise of the pianist as they drove past.
Yet later, at the Stadium itself, the mob
was astonishingly ruly: moving into the
huge wooden rotunda in sober lines like
bus queues, girls talking about dresses,
everyone smartly got up, and not a
hair-tearer or a carpet-chewer in sight.
Nobody need have worried about
bringing a self-defence kit. Seats were
taken without fights, programmes quietly
unfolded: one might have been at an
old folks’ benefit. And the feeling of
monumental calm didn’t desert the
place even when the actual performance
began: predictably, a power failure kept
the opening bandsmen, the Phantoms,
silent for appreciable minutes of what
was apparently the entertainment, there
were despairing jokes from the stage,
lame jokes, and suddenly the whole
evening threatened to resemble Saturday
night at the RSL. Even the absurd, im-
possible Phantom outfits —sky-blue suits,
spangled from head to toe with sequins,
and pillar-box red guitars—didn’t pro-
vide compensation. The screams that
followed the Phantoms’ final performing
of a fistful of tired rock-’n’-roll numbers
were dutiful rather than orgasmic.
Anyone on stage before the Beatles
is usually bound to grovel for acclaim,
but after this embarrassingly feeble
opening Johnny Devlin leaped into the
spotlight, grabbed the microphone, and
carried the audience off in a rare fit as
though this were 1958 instead of 1964.
Introduced by a flabby compere named
Alan Field, Devlin looked fat, well past
the dreaded bourne of 30, and far from
the condition that once won him the title
of Mr West Coast of New Zealand,
Nevertheless, he was, for my money,
unquestionably the best performer of
the evening. Clad in pitch-black leather
from toe to tippet, he looked at first
like an animated suitcase, then he un-
zipped, screamed, shook from top to
toe, and turned into a blackberry jelly
with legs. This surrealist demonstration
was followed by a ferociously animal
rendition of the venerable “Six O’clock
Rock”, white jersey bared, arms flung
high, shivering in his elastic-sided boots,
and ready to bring down the house
with “A Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin’ On”,
which he climaxed by lying flat on his
back on the stage and trembling in a
fashion which rather belatedly at least
set a standard of showmanship for the
evening.
★ ★ ★
T\evlin, old war horse though he is
for this kind of thing, once again
asserted himself as the best hipswinger
in the country, and probably one of the
best in the world. But excitement was
followed with bathos as Johnny Chester,
wearing boots the color of cherries with
pointed toes, a pallid suit and a cerise
tie, sang “Fever” (a poor substitute for
Peggy Lee if ever there was one) in the
dark, with luminous blue cuffs and a
face that, because of some trick of the
lighting, now matched both boots and
tie. A whey-faced combo called Sounds
Incorporated, with a leader—or chair-
man—who addressed us as brethren and
had a collapsible spine, played some-
thing called the Brontosaurus Stomp
with suitably prehistoric technique, and
then it was time for the Beatles, not a
moment too soon.
Policemen in the almost - deserted
bleachers had stood in a stiff ring around
the audience; now another circle was
formed to prevent the crowd getting
on to the stage. Three of the Beatles—■
John, George and Ringo—looked dis-
tinctly nervous as they hit the spotlight,
grotesque figures like escapees from a
Beardsley illustration to the Yellow
Book, respectively solemn, ravaged as
though by mice, and greedily lupine.
Only Paul, an attenuated choir-boy with
licorice eyes, seemed at all assured, and
for the rest of the evening he was in
charge, simpering at-the girls, dispensing
the light patter that ran between the
numbers, doing most of the singing, and
proving easily the nimblest of the quartet
at grappling with those snake-like micro-
phone cords which seem, each time one
goes to the Stadium, to have achieved
a more unnerving life of their own.
The Beatles’ appearance, certainly, is
their strongest suit. The hair-fringes,
by Ish Gebibbel of the old Kay Kayser
band out of Larry in The Three Stooges,
curtaining the dead-white faces, the
funeral suits of tight grey, black ties
and elastic-sided boots, look at once
mannered and not too riskily unlike
their (British) audiences. They seem at
once shy and sly, bold and simple, with-
drawn and cheeky. Their arrangements
and singing—whatever music critics may
be paid to say about them —are strictly
routine rhythm-and-blues, rather below
the level of, say, the Joy Boys. They
move in a very limited way, evoking the
loudest screams only when they make
deliberately sexual gestures with their
phallic guitars. Their legs move slowly
and jerkily, like those of marionettes.
Only Paul, jolly and enjoying the
applause, seems to be alive and having
fun. The others look tired, jaded and
old.

The girls, showering jelly babies and
streamers on to the stage, clearly couldn’t
have cared if the Beatles had stood there
doing tatting. The screams were extra-
ordinary injurious, one imagines, to
the frailer eardrums present, they were
more like the shrilling of cicadas than
human sounds. But it was all like an
insect chorus required for the occasion,
not, as I had expected, an autoerotic
unleashing of vicarious pleasure. The
girls jumped up, grinned, waved, but
none I could see groaned, twitched,
sobbedAfainted or began imitating a Der-
vish. When the Beatles finally left the
stage and their huge shadows on the ceil-
ing disappeared, everyone just calmly
walked out. And there wasn't a single
prostrate body to step over, or even one
chewed-up handkerchief on the floor.
The Beatles in Adelaide
Give way, square city named for a dull, dead queen,
Bulge like the trousered bottoms of squealing sixteen.
Sag like their sweaters, elegant old verandah
Of the hotel where Schnabel and Menuhin once were seen
And whispered on by black-tied and jewelled guests at dinner.
We want Paul! “We love George!”, from the marble
Steps and columns of Parliament House, where the gargle
Of politicians spat out lengthier platitudes.
O level-headed city of ornate feuds
No knife will settle, unscarred by bomb or machine-gun,
Make room for your first revolution.
In your straight streets the barricades are out tonight;
The horses of the police could be the color of fright.
O city of parks below the Founder's bronze finger
Ordering the plains between the hills and sea,
Rock to the clap of hot hands and the tears of hysteria.
But already, sidling behind the hotel into Hindley Street
The idols (with a ring-in drummer) are vanishing into cars.
The night pulsates with amplified guitars
As if someone had just plugged in the electric stars
And given the hymning firmament a new bold beat.
Inside the Centennial Hall, where in summer cold feet
Shuffled under the silent islands of exam desks
The girders are heaving like lovers, and the whole floor
Bounds under boots and the voices screaming “More!”
The neat grey figures with their medieval hair
Strum and shout to themselves in the focused glare;
Perhaps they cannot even hear themselves
For they twitch like wound-up dolls on remote shelves
While the audience is performing, shrilling on ear-drums,
Clapping, while into some favored ones there comes
The stiffening rapture, saints seeing glory unafraid.
And it is a mystery, by what presence they are swayed
Like great flocks of birds that suddenly wheel
As one, to let fly together one screaming squeal
That makes the thousands one. One in four,
Who exit (in flesh only) to the frenzied “More!”
A few ancients in their forties there, remembering that war
Is first declared in unconditional surrender,
See shiveringly through the hot idol-incense the tender
Youth of Germany, once rigid with such ecstasy.
But these are nice kids in another city.
God Save The Queen” cuts all their screaming short.
They stand to attention. It was not as rough as sport.
No one was hurt. No Adelaide policeman's corns
Would tolerate a jackboot. The cry is “Love”. The horns
Of cars could never turn to bugles. They stand,
Still humming “I only want to hold your hand'’.
But say, to a steady beat of drum and guitar,
Paul, Ringo, John and George all shouted “War”,
Or “Kill”, or “Bomb”, or “Rape’’, or “March”, or “Hate”,
What one of us, or them, would know our fate?

THE AWFUL PRESS
The Two Beaverbrooks
1 . - “Under the sixth tree from the Piccadilly gate of the
Green Park ”
By JOHN GORDON
(Former Editor-in-Chief of the London “Sunday Express”)
Mostly I write with pleasure. But
today I write with reluctance.
Heavy sorrow touches me. For
Lord Beaverbrook, who for more than
40 years —a little less than half his life
span and a little more than half mine—
has been the vital force in my life, is
gone.
Never again shall I hear that familiar,
rasping voice on my telephone. Never
again shall we softly discuss the pro-
blems of life sitting on the terrace of
the Surrey home he loved, where tensions
relaxed under the spell of one of the
most magnificent views in Britain. Never
again shall we exchange, at sentimental
moments of memory, letters expressing
in a few words the affection we had for
each other. “We have walked or run
together from small beginnings,” he
Wrote in the last one of all.
Gently, but irrevocably, a door has
closed. The quality I remember most
about him was his courage. It was of
Churchillian stature. He never flinched
in days of strain, stress and tribulation,
and I have been with him on many such
days.
The last weeks of his life were the
most courageous of all. In celebration
of his 85th birthday Lord Thomson of
Fleet offered him a dinner. A vast and
distinguished affair with a guest list of
nearly 700. To the surprise of those
most closely in touch with him, Lord
Beaverbrook accepted the invitation.
Without a moment’s hesitation. Yet
those around him knew that he was a
dying man. He knew it himself. His
doctors warned him with vehemence that
it was utterly impossible for him to face
such an ordeal. All he said was, “I’ll
go.”
For nearly two years he had lived a
life of pain tha* at times came close to
torture. The medical treatment periodi-
cally necessary was almost unendurable,
Physically he was unable to walk more
than a few steps. Even that he could
hardly do without a supporting arm.
Only the will-power generated in his
fantastic brain kept him alive.
He set himself to prepare a speech
worthy of the occasion. A speech which
he knew would be his last. For three
weeks he worked on it with an intensity
almost cruel to see. He was determined
to make the occasion one of the most
memorable in his life.
In the final days of preparation he
tried to make a recording of the speech
so that the guests could hear him if in
the end he could not be with them. The
attempt was a failure. His voice could
not do it. “No matter/’ he said. “It
won’t be needed. I’ll be there.”
Early on the day of the dinner he
went to the hotel in which it was to be
held, and rested. Shortlv before the din-
ner he was brought - down to a small
private room close to the dining-room.
There he sat, still resting. His host Lord
Thomson came to lead him to the seat
of honor.
“Let's go,” said Lord Beaverbrook,
and rose from his chair. Then an aston-
ishing thing happened. For many
weeks, as 1 have said, he had been un-
able to move more than a few yards
except in a wheel-chair. A chair was
waiting to take him into the dining-room.
He never even looked at it.
Taking the arm of his son, Max, this
amazing man walked slowly but steadily
across the entrance hall ot the hotel,
across the broad reception room in
which the guests had been taking cock-
tails, and across the full length of the
vast dining-room along the crowded
tables.
You could sense in his indomitable
eyes as he passed by what the still
dominant brain behind them was saying:
“This is the last time. 1 will walk to my
place even if it kills me.” To those who
knew the condition he was in, those
moving moments seemed an impossible
miracle.
An hour later he made that magnifi-
cent final speech of his life, so brilliant
in content, so effective in delivery that it
will be an unforgettable memory to all
who heard it. Then, again on the arm
of his proud son, he made the long walk
back to the hotel entrance. There, after
a brief rest, he entered his car, and was
driven 20 miles to his Surrey home
where he went to bed, never to rise
again. Courage of that quality is given
to few men.
Next to his superb courage I shall
remember his tremendous, inexhaustible
energy. His brain was in perpetual tur-
bulence. It spouted ideas, suggestions,
news, information, praise, criticism with
the thrust and drive of a throbbing
dynamo. It was a sort of Etna in
eruption. It was stimulating, energising,
invigorating beyond all normal standards.
As the torrent poured over you, in
some magical way it poured strength
into you. That is, if you could take it.
What had seemed impossible to achieve
you went away and did. And when you
had done it, you didn’t seem surprised.


Lord Beaverbrook’s life was literally
a series of explosions. In youth he ex-
ploded into the tough financial world of
Canada with such violence that he be-
came a dollar millionaire in his early
twenties. Talking to me of those days,
one stormy December night nearly 40
years ago as we tossed in mid-Atlantic,
he said it had been his original ambition
to make a million dollars and then
retire. But having made the million
dollars so soon, he decided that it was
so easy that he might as well make it
a million pounds. In another few years
he had made that million and more.
The great failure
rPHEN he moved to Britain to explode
-*■ almost simultaneously into politics
and newspapers, with the same violence
as he exploded into Canadian finance. I
have read that he wasn’t much of a suc-
cess in politics. I don’t think I would
quite go with that. In any case most of
his critics haven't much of a success re-
cord themselves. What most of them
have against him is that he upset their
political apple-carts. As an upsetter of
apple-carts he was supreme in his day.
And bless him for it!
His one great failure was that he could
not establish his dream of a British
Commonwealth knit into a strong eco-
nomic unit. His opponents still rejoice
at that failure. But I think that had he
succeeded, the strength of the Common-
wealth and the power of Britain might
have been more comforting today than
they are.
I lived with him ffirough most of the
newspaper explosions. And what times
of excitement, glory and achievement
they were.
I first met him in 1922. He asked
me to come to tea in the glass box of a
flat he had built on top of the rickety
old office so that he could be on the job
day and night. I found him wrapped in
a sheet, a barber cutting his hair. He
sat within a circle of electric fires which
I found almost suffocating. He was
kindly and charming. A valet brought
in tea, poured out a cup for Lord
Beaverbrook, which he sipped as the
hair-cutting went on.
Between the sips he put me through a
question session on journalism as relent-
less as a High Court cross-examination.
He was then learning journalism. And
learning it mighty fast. The ordeal went
on for an hour. Then I left. Without
tea. Some time later he telephoned
asking me to go to one of his City
offices, meet the financial editor, then
come back and tell him what I thought
of him.
I went. I found the gentleman prone
on a sofa from which he never rose. He
told me very bluntly that he wasn’t
interested in Lord Beaverbrook or my
visit.
When I went to Lord Beaverbrook's
house to report, he was in his bath. So
I sat on the edge of the bath. “Well,”
he said, “how did you find him?”
I said: “I found him rude, insolent
and arrogant. He made it quite clear
that in his view he knew more about
finance and the stock markets than you
did and didn’t want any advice from
you.”
“Fire him,” said Lord Beaverbrook.
And he was fired. To the considerable
advantage of the organisation.
Lord Beaverbrook’s worries were then
immense. He had sunk an enormous
sum of money in the “Daily Express”.
Then started the “Sunday Express” on
the whim of the moment in the teeth
of the advice of all around him. Just
as the “Daily Express” looked like
steadying up, the “Sunday Express” was
draining money away at such a rate that
his entire fortune could well have been
wiped out. Nobody believed he could
survive except himself. I don’t think
he ever lost confidence. Slowly he
gathered a team of young editorial and
management experts round him.
I am the last survivor of that original
band. And upon me he laid the burden
and responsibility of solving the problem
of the “Sunday Express”.
“Baffled”
TTe confessed frankly that it baffled
him. I wasn’t too confident that it
wouldn’t baffle me, too. The paper was
selling with difficulty about half a mil-
lion copies every Sunday, while its chief
competitor, the “Sunday Dispatch” was
selling 1,300,000 —a tremendous sale in
those days.
Moreover, the “Dispatch” had behind
it the resources of the rich “Daily Mail”,
then more powerful than the “Daily
Express”, still living on a shoestring. I
remember saying to Lord Beaverbrook
with the optimism of a man who didn’t
really understand what he was' talking
about that it seemed to me that with a
population of 11 million on our doorstep
a clean, lively enterprising paper ought
to be able to sell a million. To which
he replied: “If we ever sell 900,000 I'll
be more than satisfied.”
Well, eventually we did rise to sell
more than four and a quarter million.
We not only beat our powerful compe-
titor, but we gobbled him up. Yet I’m
sure Lord Beaverbrook died still unsatis-
fied.
How did we do it? We worked night
and day with a fury and ruthlessness that
seems unbelievable when I look back
upon it. Always Beaverbrook was the
leader, working harder than anyone.
Then somehow, with a swiftness I still
find it difficult to explain, the tide sud-
denly turned. Sales didn't move slowly
up. They soared. Revenue poured in
upon us. We became in a miraculously
short space of time the dominant and
richest newspaper in our field.
Through all those times of worry and
exacting toil I never heard Lord Beaver-
brook say one angry word to anyone of
the team. They made mistakes, as all
men must. He brushed them aside. He
spoke no word of blame. He demanded
the earth, and he got the moon as well.
He never had an office in the ordinary
sense of an office. Or a desk. He
worked standing at a high lectern, a
habit he began in his earliest days in
Canada, saying that a business conver-
sation held standing up doesn't last too
long, but get down into an armchair and
you don’t know how long it might last.
He lived incessantly on the telephone.
He was the most effective ender of a
telephone conversation I know. When
he had heard all he wanted to hear it
was “Goodbye to you.” And down went
the receiver, even if you were in the
middle of a sentence.
He loved to do his talking while
walking in the open. Some of his sum-
monses to walks were a little startling to
those who did not know him. Once
while I was getting a visa at the US
Embassy in Grosvenor Square, a flushed
embassy girl secretary came running up
and said: “Lord Beaverbrook has tele-
phoned and says will you meet him in
10 minutes under the sixth tree from
the Piccadilly gate of the Green Park.”
I must not give the impression that
Lord Beaverbrook was a man whose
interests were so narrow that work
absorbed him wholly. He had wide and
sometimes unusual relaxations. He
loved fun of an impish sort. He could
laugh, easily and explosively. He loved
to gather good conversationalists round
his table and shone with the best of them.
He never missed a Gipsy Smith revival
meeting if he could help it.
We used to do much cinema-going
together in the days before he had a
cinema in his home. Always in the
cheapest seats. But he wasn't the per-
fect companion in a cinema. With a
boyish zest he would dig me in the ribs
and tell me what was coming—especially
if it was a knockabout film—in a voice
that rang across the auditorium, evoking
a chorus of protesting hush-hushes.
The empty flat
'C'arlier in this piece I wrote of the
glass-sided flat he built for himself
on top of the office. Years later he shut
it down and wrote a touching article
describing how he closed the door, locked
it, went down the stairs, and was now
retired. He retired at intervals and most
retirements barely lasted a week. But
he never reopened the flat. It remained
shut until the war came, when it was
beautifully refurnished in case he might
need it.


He returned to it only once for a
short hour. I remember that night so
well. He telephoned me about midnight
and asked if I had seen the flat since it
had been restored. I said, No. 111
come along in 10 minutes and pick you
up and we’ll go and see it,” he said.
We looked out from its wide windows
across the darkness of London, the lights
of which the war had put out. “How
different,” he said. We looked round
the room in which so many dramatic
things had happened that had left their
memories with us. “How nice it is,” he
said. But his face was tired with care
and sadness. Then the telephone rang.
He picked it up. Suddenly the care,
the sadness and the years slipped from
his face.
“It’s Max,” he said. Max, his fighter-
pilot son, reporting that he had° just
completed his final mission before being
grounded for the usual rest spell and
was safe and well. The father who
walked out of that flat with me a little
later was a sprightly, gay, happy, very
different man.
There, in these few impressions, is my
picture of the Beaverbrook I knew so
well. I shall remember him not so
much as the great restless creator and
driver, but as a man of tremendous
courage: a man whose charm could be
irresistible, whose kindness never failed,
whose charity was immense and whose
sympathy for those in trouble was
boundless,
Peace be with him.
2. - Myth and Reality
The dwarf whispering obscenities in the emperor's ear''
By a Special Correspondent
There were two Beaverbrooks. There
was the myth, elaborately con-
structed by his own newspapers, of
hero and statesman. And there was the
far more intractable reality, in which
hero and villain, malice and generosity
were woven together into a figure of
great complexity and impact. As a
politician, he had two periods of great-
ness in the two world wars. For the
rest, it was a record of unsurpassed
fatuity. He saw himself as a tragic,
evangelising figure whose gospel of
empire fell upon stony ground. But
that was part of the hero myth which
he propagated about himself. The
policies he advocated were for the most
part silly and were based -on a narrow,
ill-considered and outmoded concept of
the old white-dominated Empire. It is
much to the credit of the public which
relished the entertainment of his news-
papers that their central political mes-
sage was ignored for the irrelevant rub-
bish it was.
In the Second World War his
achievement was unique, though here
again the myth intrudes. It is true that
few other men could have brought to
bear the demonic energy and iconoclasm
which smashed the production bottle-
necks of 1940 and 1941. But it is
equally true that nobody else was given
a comparable opportunity. Churchill,
having chosen his man, gave him carte
blanche to lay waste everything that
stood in his way. The result was a de-
cisive victory on a narrow but crucially
important front—and increased difficulty
for those who had to soldier on in the
less publicised sectors of the industrial
war.
The legend that Lord Beaverbrook
has created about his time at the Ministry
of Aircraft Production is true up to a
point. But it does less than justice to
Churchill, who took the basic decision
to let loose a freebooting commando, re-
gardless of the wider consequences. Out-
side the Ministry, Beaverbrook was a
reckless and injudicious member of the
War Cabinet: his Labor colleagues, who
worshipped Churchill and admired Eden
and Lyttelton without party rancor, saw
Beaverbrook as a malign influence. Hugh
Dalton’s savage assessment that Beaver-
brook’s relation with Churchill was that
of “the dwarf whispering obscenities in
the emperor's ear” may have been un-
just. But it is true that, once he had
played his great role in the early crisis,
he became a symbol of mistrust and
disunity.
That postscript to 1940 does not
figure in the myth.
As a newspaperman, Beaverbrook was
probably the most successful of his age.
He inherited the revolution of North-
cliffe and transformed the stumbling and
inadequate popular news-sheets of the
’twenties into the most flamboyant (if
not the most potent) expressions of the
mass-entertainment industry. To Hell
with balance and enlightenment: there
was a newly-literate and socially-insecure
mass-readership ready to lap up the
superbly-packaged mixture of greed,
envy, uncharitableness, personal ven-
detta and social reassurance which the
“Express” newspapers have so brilliantly
and profitably purveyed. What damage
he might have done if newspapers had
remained the dominant factor in mass-
communication can only be surmised.
In fact the rise of State-controlled broad-
casting, charged with objectivity and
political balance, largely offset his in-
fluence and reduced him to the status
of a great public entertainer.
This essentially trivial role was per-
haps the great cross he bore. Surrounded
to a deplorable extent by sycophants, he
genuinely thought of himself as a great
prophet, and the chained crusader was
the myth that he sold himself. Yet the
role of entertainer—violent, funny, cruel,
irreverent, irresponsible and from time
to time capriciously magnanimous—well-
fitted his curiously captivating persona-
lity. When the full balance-sheet is
read, Beaverbrook will presumably be
remembered by posterity for his news-
papers and his wartime achievement.
But his contemporaries will think first
of the man. He was held in real affec-
tion by most of those who knew him.
They liked him not because of the puffs
he had printed about himself in his news-
papers, but because there was an attrac-
tion, which many found irresistible,
about his idiosyncracies, his passions, his
wit, his shameless egocentricity and his
almost total irresponsibility. Because, in
a word, he was larger than life and
because the comparatively mature
society in which he lived had frustrated
his passion for power and rendered him
impotent. It is not a verdict which he
would have enjoyed. But he was too
important and contradictory a figure to
be consigned to purgatory with the con-
ventional British valedictions of de
mortuis nil nisi bunkum. From the

How much did you pay for peas today, Fred?
The market price of peas may not immediately affect the factory cost of a locally
manufactured product, but the proximity of your plant to modern efficient
shopping centres can affect morale and general efficiency. In Mackellar County
there are many modern shopping centres, the biggest of which is the new £6
million Warringah Mall. Set in the centre of ample parking areas are local branches
of major city stores, and in the pleasant alfresco arcades, small stores, shops and
cafes. Mackellar County’s annual retail expenditure is in the vicinity of £22,000,000.
These facilities constitute just one of the reasons for selecting Mackellar County
as the ideal site for your new factory or ccmmercial enterprise.
Mackellar County encourages industrial investment.
The industrial areas are only ten miles from the heart of the
city, yet surrounded by unspoiled bushland. Careful inter-
relation of industrial and residential areas close to main
highways, public transport, schools and shopping centres
have put this county years ahead in area development
planning. Mackellar County provides an efficient system of
arterial highways...plenty of space for growth and expansion
...pleasant surroundings for greater plant efficiency...estab-
lished residential areas for both executives and staff.

The Jews in
Australia
Zionism on the wane?
By SAM LIPSKI
(Concluded from last week)
/Compared with the excitement it could
arouse in its crusading days the
Zionist movement now seems on the
wane. Its public affairs are conducted in
a remarkable mixture of unexamined
propaganda and ancient stereotypes. It
has had one sort of influence, setting
much of the tone of any public meeting
by the constant use of “declarese” (the
English translation of Israel's Declara-
tion of Independence), in which much
Zionist discussion is couched. Like
Zionism, the Bund had its origins in the
Europe of the late nineteenth century.
As a lewish socialist party it was a real
political force in Poland. In Australia
it is fighting a losing battle against the
times. The children of its youth move-
ment are taught Yiddish. But among
themselves they speak English, as almost
certainly will their children.
The Bund adds a touch of color to
public life but the most optimistic esti-
mate of its membership would be 250.
In the overall development of Australian
Jewry its real impact has been minimal.
All this is part of the Jewish community
and part of Jewish expression. There
are internal conflicts. Temperament,
ideas, need for funds, countries of origin,
contrasting European experiences, all add
to the fluidity of communal development.
“Jewish community” is really an abstrac-
tion; at the r oment it has no coherent
form or solid outline. (Pace Mr Ash-
kanasy.) But it is neither religion nor
ideology which expresses the image of
the Jew within his own community.
The great Jewish-American historian
Salo Baron has seen the fund - raiser
taking the place of the priest in Jewish
life. In Australia one look at the round
of dinners and drawing-room meetings,
the hosts and hostesses’ luncheons, brun-
cheons, cocktail parties, the publicity and
propaganda, the endless campaign meet-
ings, the prestige attached to the pre-
sidents of appeals—and one can under-
stand why Baron saw all these as taking
the place of the elaborate rites of devo-
tion set forth in the book of Leviticus.
The young Jew who is in revolt against
the materialistic values of his general
society reacts even more sharply when
he sees them reflected in his own com-

munity. The appeals certainly reflect
them. The Jewish Press, with occasional
exceptions, is parochial in outlook. It
is now going through its yearly propa-
ganda drive for its biggest fund-raising
effort —the United Israel Appeal. In
giving, the Jew in Australia can see his
most attractive and least attractive
features. In sheer quantity the Jew gives
generously to a whole range of causes.
Last year Melbourne Jews spent
£450,000 on education within the com-
munity and donated a similar amount
to other causes—to Israel and to social
services, covering old-people's homes and
sheltered workshops. The amount is
quite disproportionate to their numbers
and relative economic condition.
But the values which the community
seems to encourage with the appeal and
its ancillary functions are the values of
the big giver. Money is often the mea-
sure of success. The explanation for this
is simple and complex at the same time.
The maintenance of a separate Jewish
identity with all its ramifications is a
costly business. There are few intellec-
tual assimilationists who would disagree
with the goal. Yet the methods look
like becoming endemic. Jews are in a
hurry “to arrive” in Australia. In a
hurry to succeed in business, in profes-
sions, in their techniques of raising
money for their own needs. They have
spared little time to think.
Identification with Israel
T do not want to paint a picture of un-
qualified affluence because it would
not be entirely true. Jews are dispro-
portionately represented in the adminis-
trative, professional and business sections
of the economy. Many are small busi-
nessmen, self-employed. With young
Jews proportionally attending universities
at between eight and ten times the rate
of the general population, their repre-
sentation in the professions will increase.
At the same time the Jewish Welfare
Services daily deal with problems of un-
employment, economic hardship, especi-
ally among some more recent post-war
migrants and housing.
The social and cultural expressions of
Jewish life in Australia occur nearly
wholly within the framework of the first
three categories—the religious, the ideo-
logical and the philanthropic. Transcend-
ing them all is the identification with
Israel which ranges from encouraging
one's children to join a Zionist youth
movement which will aim to recruit them
for settlement on a kibbutz in Israel
(with limited success) to the psycho-
logical kick a Jew derives from reading
that Israel has jet planes, beauty queens,
an army, a cabinet, kibbutzim. The
existence of Israel has consciously and
unconsciously made Jews in Australia, in
common with Jews throughout the world,
more secure in their being Jewish.

*We are. you see. beyond
Mr. Rylah's jurisdiction.
What do Jews feel about anti-Semitism
in Australia? The Executive Council of
Australian Jewry, roof body for the
various state boards of deputies to which
are affiliated the whole range of Jewish
religious, cultural and philanthropic
groups, generally takes the view that
anti-Semitism is not a major threat in
Australia, that it is restricted to the
lunatic fringe, and poses no serious pro-
blems.
The ECAJ is the official spokesman for
Jews and acts on their behalf in relations
with the Government. Yet of the eight-
man executive on the ECAJ none, in the
words of one former Buchenwald inmate,
has seen a Nazi, been in a concentra-
tion camp or carries a tattoo on his
arm. Official leadership sees anti-
Semitism differently from many of the
post-war migrants who say they know
only too well the dangers of minimising
any anti-Semitic outbursts. But they,
too, would generally agree on the lack
of anti-Semitism in Australian public life.
Most have not yet reached the stage
where they seek entry into those golf
clubs which still bar Jews.
There are signs of panic, however,
when there is a major outbreak of
swastika daubing and to some Jews the
memories of twenty years ago are still
vivid. Panic over, or exaggeration of,
anti-Semitism is not confined to migrant
Jews. Third and fourth generation Jews
are just as likely to react strongly to
anti-Semitism by calling for legislation,
police action or deputations. Their re-
action can best be summed up in the
words of an Israeli visitor who said that
every Australian Jew he had met, from
the most assimilated to the most intensely
Jewish, regarded anti-Semitism as a dog
of varying ferocity. All, however,
acknowledged that while it sometimes
slumbered, it would never die.
Anti-Semitism in Russia
nPHE biggest event in the 1960 s for Aus-
A tralian Jews has, however, not been
their reaction to anti-Semitism in Aus-
tralia but their reaction to anti-Semitism
in Russia. It raised two fundamental
questions which recent events suggest
have still not been resolved. The first
was what should Jews in Australia do
about the discrimination against Jews in
the Soviet Union? The second problem
which arose out of this was what should
be the role of Jewish leadership in Aus-
tralian political life, or more specifically
was there a conflict between party politi-
cal affiliation and one's responsibilities to
the Jewish community?
The results of the conflicts raised by
these problems may be summarised
briefly. Despite doubts and protests the
Victorian Jewish leadership led by
Mr Maurice Ashkanasy, QC, and Public
Relations Officer, Mr I. J. Leibler, saw
the fruits of their initiative in action
taken by the Australian Government
which protested against Soviet discrimina-
tion in the United Nations.
Late in 1962 Sydney and Melbourne
boards of deputies saw a rift open be-
tween them which has not yet closed.
Relations are not as strained as they were
two years ago but they are not very
much better. At the time Sydney’s Mr
S. D. Einfeld was President of the ECAJ
and also a Labor Parliamentarian. His
open clash with Mr Ashkanasy and Mr
Leibler has left its mark on relations
between the now Melbourne-based ECAJ
and Sydney's board.
The basis for Mr Einfeld’s anger and
Sydney’s support of Mr Einfeld, was, on
paper, that the Victorian leadership had
broken “channels of communication”,
that in doing so it had alienated the
Labor Party, that its publicity methods
had further alienated the Labor Party
and had led to the bitterness over Senator
Cohen’s opposition to the move for a
United Nations’ protest.
The events were certainly traumatic
for Jews in their public stance and the
repercussions continue today. The for-
mer “special relationship” which both
Labor leaders and Jewish leaders believed
existed between the Jewish community
and the ALP has probably suffered.
Is there a Jewish vote? Jewish leaders
behave as if they shudder at the possibi-
lity. Obviously because of small num-
bers it is nonsense to take this discussion
too seriously.
The “special relationship” between Jews
and the Labor Party has rested on the
activities of Dr Evatt in the United
Nations in relation to Israel, the role of
Mr Calwell as Immigration Minister
during the immediate post-war years, and
a traditional preference among Jews for
parties left rather than right of centre.
How this preference works in Austra-
lia is hard to pin down because of the
rapid social mobility of Jews. Never-
theless it is clear from overseas research
that Jews tend to vote for the left of
centre parties in contradiction to their
economic position as middle class or
higher. It could be assumed that cer-
tainly the majority of new settlers would
vote Labor. Against this must be set
the fact that electorates with large Jewish
populations like Isaacs in Melbourne and
Philip in Sydney do not necessarily
always return Labor men. In fact the
opposite trend is clear.
There are many ways of looking at the
events surrounding the Soviet Jewry
question. One way is to see them as
expressions of the Jewish quest for iden-
tity. The ghetto, whether walled or
unwalled, has created an attitude of mind
among Jews. The American psychoana-
lyst Bruno Bettelheim puts it this way:
“A certain type of ghetto thinking has
as its purpose to avoid taking action”.
The avoidance of action is because the
Jew must not offend the goyim, the non-
Jews.
The printed word
rpHE most disconcerting aspect of Jew-
ish defensiveness is the Jew’s con-
ditioned reaction to the word “Jew” in
print. It is almost impossible to explain
why a Jew, whether he be second, third
or even fourth generation, still reacts a
little abnormally to the mention of Jews
on television, in print, or in public life.
There is a feeling of having to create
an image, so that when the word is
mentioned it should be w'ith the right
“connotations”. So “public relations”
has become soqiewhat of a magic word
in Jewish circles with every Jew his own

to do things. Most Jews would probably
prefer it if there was not mention of
Jews at all anywhere in public. It would
be the ultimate realisation of the tacitly
accepted, but rarely articulated, agree-
ment for an organised silence about what
Jews are really like.
This is a defence mechanism. What
many Jews yet fail to realise is that it
is not a very effective one. In the back
of their minds, because of their historic
experience, is an awareness of the way
mass media can be manipulated.
The controversy over Soviet Jewry
was in this sense, at least, a watershed
development. Together with some recent
events at both Melbourne University and
Sydney University where Jewish students
have shown some heartening tendencies
to break out of their parents’ mental
ghettoes on this issue, it has led slowly
to a new realisation that Jews need not
fear the mass media but can learn to
live with them.
The future
And so what of the future? Perhaps it
is this new deghettoised Jew who
neither apologises for his Jewishness nor
feels that it is somehow a sign of his
being chosen to suffer, who also creates
some optimism about the future of
Jewry in Australia.
And yet specifically Jewish questions
torment every Jew—what sort of Jewish
education should his children get? Should
they go to a day school or will this cut
them off from their non-Jewish world?
Should he and his wife join suburban
discussion groups? Should they attend
appeal meetings? How do they explain
that despite rebellion they have ended up
with an almost exclusive circle of Jewish
friends?
According to many Jews there are
dangers to Jewish survival in Australia.
Freedom has replaced the persecution of
Europe as the main threat. With better
economic opportunities and community
acceptance has come intermarriage,
loosening of ties and oblivion.
It is only part of the picture. Contrary
to the expectations of sociologists and
warnings of rabbis, many Jews are be-
coming more Jewish in Australia despite
a very low birth rate among Jews which
will have to double just to keep up
with the national average.
Those Jews who seek the intellectual
idea of Judaism as a civilisation of dis-
sent, of non-conformism, bearing witness
to the whole world and not just the Blue
Box functions of the Jewish National
Fund are disappointed in the quality of
Jewish life. And Jewish life reflects it.
Nevertheless, Jews in Australia, in or out-
side the ghetto, are speeding up their
own search for themselves. The answers
of the next generation to the questions
being asked today will be interesting and
probably different.


SPORT
All That Sunshine and
Two Doubles Too
The seductions of Doomben and Eagle Farm
By DISCUS
The big races in Brisbane command
most of the attention at this time
of the year, when even thinking
about the north has its points on after-
noons with the thermometer at 40 or
50 and the wind off the snow. Those
Queenslanders have been very cunning,
too. Their carnival is not merely the
usual double event such as we have in
Sydney and in Melbourne. They offer
the keen racegoer two doubles, and all
that sunshine.
Eagle Farm has had its two days.
Doomben's come next. But on the same
weekends as the leviathan punters are
trying to make up for their Eagle Farm
losses, the bookmakers are making their
hay in the sunshine, and the jockeys and
trainers are polishing up their excuses
for the Ten Thousand and the Doomben
Cup, hardier souls in big woolly over-
coats will be training their glasses on
the fences at Flemington, where the
jumpers compete for the £4OOO Grand
National Hurdle over three miles and
the £6OOO Grand National Steeple over
three miles one furlong.
The prizes seem hardly worth the
bother in these days of £25,000' flat
races, but Victorians disagree. And if
the biggest prizes are small, owners from
Adelaide. Melbourne and all points
between can pick up some reasonable
change in the minor Hurdles and
Steeples on almost every, programme
during the season.
Jockeys probably bless these very
English survivals too, although in their
case it must be a mixed blessing, a
refuge for the overweight silk, if he can
stay out ot hospital. Two and three
miles are long ways over the jumps and
broken collarbones are the minor
hazards of the business.
For the punter, nothing else in the
world has the glorious uncertainty of a
Steeple or Hurdle, although unfortun-
ately the odds never reflect it. A few
weeks ago, for instance, hurdler Blue
Pelt started 13/8 favorite, came home
30 lengths behind the winner, and the
next week won by 20 lengths at 6/4. At
his next start he was 2/ 1 favorite against
Ross, who had beaten him, and Aravino,
whom he had beaten. In came Aravino,
Ross, With Discretion . . . and Blue Pelt.
For some reason, the books took a
set against Aravino, which seldom runs
a bad race, and he was 16/1. Later he
ran a 5/1 second to Hot Sun. To add
to the confusion, Sir Chester Mani-
fold's four-year-old Pattering bobbed
up to beat a National fancy, With Dis-
cretion, in a race in which Lusillo fell,
so that no one could have a line on his
more recent form. He was shaping well
early in the season.
In the Steeples, last year’s GN
winner, Sir Cameron, has been showing
up well, and in Adelaide Devon Boy,
second last year, is finding form; but
who can select the chances while many
of the best GN Hurdle prospects are
still in the Steeple field?

man who preferred Sydney’s
weather to Brisbane’s during the
holiday weekend must have regretted it
a little. When the jockeying for chances
in the Stradbroke was in full swing, one
Athol Mulley expressed grave doubts
about the value of a journey north.
“There are plenty of mounts in Sydney,”
he declared, and when the field left the
barrier at Eagle Farm, Athol was in
Sydney having one of his worst week-
ends in a long time.
He managed to win one race, but
even that was a dead-heat with Jack
Thompson. On Stradbroke day Mulley
rode two thirds, and on Brisbane Cup
day he scored two seconds and four
thirds. His shared win was in a £7BO
welter.
It will be interesting to see whether
he decides to buck that kind of luck
and ride in Sydney again on July 4.

J>ugby, the amateur game, has some
new rules designed to encourage
more open play, and who seems to be
taking, the fullest advantage of them but'
New Zealand, which has swung around
from a hard, dour style of football to a
sparkling open game which should gain
the code some more followers if Aus-
tralian sides are as enterprising.
The New Zealand Colts have finished
a tour of four States unbeaten, partly
because they were an excellent team,
and partly because they played to the
full with the new rules. First they over-
ran the southern States by 56-3, in
Hobart, beat Victoria by 58 to 3 despite
Bryan Palmer’s coaching, then went on
to beat a NSW under-23 side, which in-
cluded six Wallabies, by 16-0. Last
weekend they played the new game in
Queensland, with the Wallaby selectors
on hand to scan the local team for
Wallaby potentials.
The Wallabies will tour New Zealand
in August, and this visit by the Colts
has been a shock. Whether it’s a bad
one for morale or an incentive to better
football will depend on events when the
Wallaby trials take place in July.
While the sparkling Colts-NSW game
(crowd 8000) was going on at Sydney
Sports Ground, an equally one-sided
match was in progress next door at the
Cricket Ground (crowd 20,000), where
Australia gave the French Rugby League
team another drubbing. But at least
that time France had some weight in
the forwards, and they used it with
determination. I think if they had per-
sisted more in bulldogging their forwards
through with the ball they might have
scored at least one try. But they passed
to their backs who were too light and
too slow to penetrate, and in fact lost
ground more often than not.
Just as the New Zealanders have
switched to the open game to the
mystification of those who used to be
its specialists, so Australia has taken
and improved the open French game in
Rugby League, and with our young,
heavy but very fast backs, it will take a
good team to stop Australia's Kangaroos
for some years to come.
* ★ ★
Tn Sydney the Australian code staggers
on, not helped a bit by the annual
drubbing the NSW side gets in the inter-
state carnival matches. But there may
be some cheer in NSW’s defeat by 109
points to 59 at the hands of some
Queenslanders who played powerful
football. It backs up the feeling that
the code is doing well in Queensland.
Next weekend Victoria meets Western
Australia, and this is regarded as the
testing match for Victoria, which has
already downed South Australia. But
from now on Queensland will have to
be taken seriously, too, and that would
seem to be all for the good of the game.
After all, Victoria’s Soccer team
which had the fewest goals scored
against it by Everton and was regarded as
a certainty to beat Queensland- —received
a healthy shock defeat in Brisbane.


OVERSEAS
The War in Borneo
A 10-year struggle, possibly, and costs running into nine figures
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH in Kuching
As final details for the withdrawal
of Indonesian terrorists in Sarawak
and Sabah had been negotiated,
security forces here are in fact bracing
themselves to defend these Malaysian
territories against intensified attacks. For
President Soekarno is confidently ex-
pected to cheat despite the Summit.
Almost on the eve of the Summit talks
a group of Indonesian raiders, between
50 and 100 strong, had infiltrated into
East Sarawak while others had burned
down a frontier village at the other end
of the State, and there ate indications
that at least half the men in future
marauding bands may be Indonesian
regulars.
This week I saw why Britain must
expect this to be a long war unless a
political solution is found.
Dominating the choppy green sea of
the Sarawak jungle, the last and highest
crest loomed above the bubble of the
diminutive Hiller helicopter and the
pilot beside me suddenly swung it in a
tight turn to the left. For up there,
shimmering in the damp tropical heat,
was the border with Indonesian Borneo.
No more than five miles beyond the
watershed lay the safe jungle camp from
which the Indonesian armed terrorists
launched their raids into Sarawak and
Sabah killing, burning, occasionally
penetrating deeply in an attempt to set
up a “liberated area”. But the 10,000-
strong British and Malaysian security
forces defending the North Borneo
States may not cross that one-way start-
line to destroy the enemy in his tanta-
lisingly close bases or harass his long
communications.
“We can only defend. And since
that means we can never win,” an officer
told me dryly, “all we can do is to lose
as slowly as possible.”
It is not easily done. Laconic British
soldiers or wiry Gurkhas are flown for-
ward in helicopters, bundled out at some
precarious landing site—perhaps a 50-
yard clearing in dense, mountain jungle
—and set out on five-day patrols in the
border area. Each man carries more
than 60 pounds of rations and equip-
ment. A file of figures in sweat-soaked
jungle green, these patrols may not cover
more than three miles a day in thick
underbrush.
For efficient interception of the hide-
and-seek enemy, scores of helicopter
landing sites must be cut, and for this
men armed with saws and explosives
must first be winched and roped down
into the jungle gloom from helicopters
hovering above a screen of trees that
may be more than 100 feet high.
And the threatened frontiers of Sara-
wak and Sabah, the narrow strip that
caps the otherwise Indonesian island of
Borneo, are 970 miles long.
Across this border there are more
than 4000 Indonesian regular troops
and armed irregulars. But they do not
apply the only pressure to the thin, red
dotted line of security forces. In the
coastal swamps and estuaries British
soldiers paddle unfamiliar boats down
yellow-brown rivers or struggle through
huge thickets of waterlogged nippa
palm in order to trap cells of the Sara-
wak clandestine Communist organisa-
tions whose militant cadres train eager
recruits with dummy weapons in hidden
camps. If allowed to flourish and
acquire arms from the Indonesians, this
local subversive movement could put up
to 4000 men into the jungle, it is
estimated, and compel Britain to strip
her forces in Germany to suppress them.
It took 12 years and 23 battalions to
end the Communist emergency in
Malaya, where there was no external
Indonesian threat.
Coastline Shackleton planes and mine-
sweepers armed with radar, and an
incongruous collection of vessels all
designed for other jobs naval stores
ships, landing craft, armed native trading
boats and rubber rafts fitted with muffled
outboard engines patrol endlessly to
prevent a secret seaborne landing.
About 10 battalions of British,
Gurkha and Malaysian troops form the
backbone of this complex defence
system, and in some cases one unit must
protect a stretch of border more than
150 miles long. At least one British
battalion is on its third tour here since
the December, 1962, revolt in Brunei.
Theoretically, ultimate relief for Britain’s
hard-pressed tourist Army lies in the
build-up of Malaysian security forces.

But these must be drawn from a nation
of only ten million, and their ex-

spread.
Moreover, no reinforcements can
operate effectively if there are no heli-
copters to lift and supply them. Troops
have been known to return to base in a

that took three days on the ground.

In this makeshift war in which only
heat and jungle are not in short supply,
the British other rank learns “to lose
slowly” with the professional stoicism of
the near mercenary. In the past two
years he has been landed in Brunei,
alerted for Zanzibar, pushed into Aden,
pulled out of .Germany, flown into East

far removed from the concept of “Queen

jungle hilltops officers and men at
company HQs sleep opensided in
bashas on short stilts, thatched with
palm and floored with split bamboo. In
a tin-roofed mess as hot as sin, junior
commanders stripped to the waist talk
of Sarawak as a splendid training ground
in jungle warfare, a sort of equatorial
Salisbury Plain. But the acute frustra-
tion emerges', the angry itch to cross the
forbidden Indonesian border and hit
the enemy on his own ground. Senior
officers keenly sympathise, and there
are also inelegant names for the planners
who tie down 52,000 troops in Germany
for a war that will never be fought and
allow five much-needed battalions to
idle on the beaches of undefendable
Hong Kong.
Meanwhile the maids-of-all-work are
here indefinitely. The helicopters evacu-
ate native border villages, lifting pigs
and chickens, jars, gongs, and cholera
victims. A medical orderly in an up-
river company position treats 30 native
Ibans a day from nearby longhouses.
Soldiers give chocolate to grinning

How long will the slogging match last
and the British soldier remain? Perhaps
10 years, say some responsible officers
without hesitation, and the cost could
run well into nine figures.

Australia Can Now Compete

New loader at Port Kembla will boost the industry
This diagram of the new £5 million coal loader at Port Kembla shows: (1)

reclaimer; (5) ship-loading conveyors; (6) ship-loading gantries.
solidified its position in the
Japanese coal market last week with
the commissioning of a coal loading plant
at Port Kembla, equal to the most
modern in the world.
The loader enables the largest bulk
carriers to be filled within 24 hours
instead of, as previously, three or four
days. The £5 million plant, capable of
loading 2000 tons an hour (compared
with the old loader’s capacity of 5000
tons a day) was undoubtedly a deciding
factor earlier this year when Japanese
buyers renewed expired five-year con-
tracts for a further three years and for
increased tonnages.
While the plant does not mean any
great saving in loading costs, it does
mean that ships will incur fewer charges
because of their shorter stay. This in
turn means shorter delivery times and
more attractive prices to overseas buyers.
Although the loader was not officially
opened until last Friday it is already
paying dividends.
These figures speak for themselves:—
In the first five months of this year (the
loader has been in operation since Janu-
ary and, despite teething troubles, has
been working almost full time) 552,000
tons of coal—an annual rate of 1.32 mil-
lion tons —have been loaded on ships at
Port Kembla destined for Japan. This
compares more than favorably with the
1,005,000 tons loaded for Japan in the
last calendar year—an improvement of
nearly one-third.
The faster loading facilities at Port
Kembla mean that in two to three years,
Australia will rank equally with the US
as the largest coal supplier to Japan.
The lower cost of NSW coals at Japanese
steel mills is now so attractive to the
buyer as to justify multi-million ton
contracts.
Promptings for quicker loading and
turn-round of ships came from the
Japanese themselves who, on coal
missions in 1958 and 1961, said that
coal-loading facilities would have to be
improved if a big trade was to be
developed.
Coal and coke are carried to the
loader either by road or rail. Road
vehicles can be emptied two at a time
into a 65-ton hopper that channels' the
coal directly to dumps or the ship. Rail
cars are emptied by being inverted bodily
through 360 degrees. Conveyor belts
carry the coal to dumps or the ship. The
coal is carried from dumps by bucket-
wheel reclaimer-fed conveyor belts on
to two gantry-type travelling loaders
which load into ships’ holds at the rate
of 1000 tons of coal, or 400 tons of coke,
an hour.
Eventually NSW loading facilities will
serve nearly all coal-producing areas
and provide loaders covering 140 miles
of the NSW coast. A third loader is
planned at Newcastle where harbor
alterations are already under way.
Prime exports from Newcastle will
probably be soft coking coals for Japan
which, although it is relying principally
on home production at present, is con-
sidered likely to satisfy most of its global
quota from the Newcastle area.

COAL SUPPLEMENT
A Transformed Industry
“Economy of the country was near to collapse ”
as a topic of conversation —or
even of interest hasn’t attracted
much attention from Australians in
recent years. Vaguely, from time to
time we’ve been conscious of mines
closing, of the displacement of mine-
workers, of talk about new export mar-
kets and of competition from oil. But
ask most people where their electricity
comes from and they’ll say, “A power-
house’’. Likewise, steel comes from a
steelworks.
The black —but now washed and no
longer grimy—mineral that provides 52
per cent of the total energy consumed
in the nation, and without which industry
would collapse, has never seemed to
evoke much excitement.
It was hardly surprising, therefore,
that the doings of a quartet of enter-
tainers from a much older coal-producing
country captured public imagination a
good deal more than did the official
opening at Port Kembla last Friday of
a high-speed coal loading plant costing
around £5 million.
But for those with memories long
enough to recall the strangling grip coal
had over industry and domestic life in
the early post-war years, the automated
Port Kembla loader could have been a
symbol of probably the most remarkable
transformation in any key sector of the
national post-war economy.
The fact that the coal industry, having
once tottered on the brink of catastrophe,
no longer figures largely in public aware-
ness is a testimony to just how com-
plete the transformation has been.
That it took the combined legislative
and financial resources of the Federal
and New South Wales Governments and
the investment of close on £lOO million
to effect the change, points up the size
of the task.
Tucked away in the labyrinthine re-
cesses of Sydney’s Parliament House, a
Joint Committee of the Assembly and
Council is currently studying the indus-
try to learn of its past and assess its
future. By Joint Coal Board Chairman
B. W. Hartnell, it has been told that in
1947 when the Board was established by
the two Governments “the coal-mining
industry was in a backward, chaotic
state, when relations between proprie-
tors and mineworkers were poisoned
with bitterness, and when the industry
was unable to meet the country's coal
requirements; in short, when this great
industry of basic importance to the
economic life of the country was near
to collapse’’.
He was putting it mildly. The mines
were described as hell holes of near-slave
conditions; industrial warfare was being
waged on the coalfields with a hatred
never approached in any other industry,
and a post-war surge of manufacturing
development that wanted to gulp great
quantities of steel, power and cement
found itself hamstrung by a pick and
shovel fuel supplier.
Those were the days when households
were monotonously plunged into dark-
ness while the evening meal stood half-
cooked on the stove, when gas, trams and
trains were rationed and when coal from
South Africa and India kept the lights
of Melbourne and Adelaide only faintly
aglow.
The answer of the two Governments
was jointly to set up a coal board with
powers so sweeping that it could vir-
tually do what it liked with the industry.
It could close any mine with a stroke
of the pen, or open new ones of its own.
It could fix prices and control distribu-
tion, lend money or buy an insurance
company—and it did all of these things.
Equally vital was the appointment of
one man, Mr Justice Gallagher, to be
called the Coal Industry Tribunal, with
wide powers to deal with all of the indus-
trial problems of the industry divorced
of formality, jurisdiction and demarca-
tion. As a result, the 1949-50 figure of
14.28 per cent of man-shifts lost through
industrial disputes was cut to 1.29 per
cent in 1962-63.
This, taken together with widespread
The Ross Cape, the largest dry cargo carrier ever to enter Australian ports,

modernisation and re-organisation of
production, has brought a result that
must be the envy of every other industry
and a text-book case study of manage-
ment practice.
Though average wages have risen sub-
stantially (they are up to £2OOO a year
at the best mines, and around £l6OO for
the whole industry), the average price
per ton of coal at the pithead has fallen
from 635. ten years ago to 525. 6d. today.
Production of New South Wales coal
that was just over 11 million tons in
1950-51 will reach an'all-time record of
20 million tons for the year ending this
month. And at the same time, the num-
ber of men employed by collieries has
been virtually halved.
In other words, the industry now pro-
duces twice the coal with half the men,
while paying higher wages and selling
at a lower price.
HPoday, according to Mr Hartnell, the
New South Wales coal industry is as
efficient as any in Australia and is more
highly mechanised than any other coal
industry in the world. Except for the
segment producing coal of a type directly
affected by competition from oil, it is a
profitable industry and, over-all, its mar-
kets and its production are expanding.
Coal, of course, still has its problems.
For purely steam-raising purposes it is
under severe price-cutting competition
from cheap fuel oil and there are de-
mands for a national fuel policy that will
make the best use of Australia's indi-
genous resources of energy.
The industry already has gone a long
way towards reshaping itself to changing
conditions and, in this, the emergence of
a market in Japan for about one-sixth of
the New South Wales production has
been invaluable for the southern mines.
Research, too, holds promise as a
means of widening coal’s market, and a
recent agreement between the Common-
wealth, the States, producers and con-
sumers will lift expenditure on research
to more than £1 million a year.
One of the most encouraging pointers
to coal’s future, however, lies in the new
eagerness with which investors are look-
ing to it as a suitable field for capital
expenditure. So long as it continues to
attract large-scale investment (£67 mil-
lion has gone into New South Wales
mines in the last 10 years) managements
can be expected to back their outlays
with the vigor and imagination needed
to meet new challenges.
No one in the industry expects the
going to be easy, but the great sheet
anchors of power generation and steel
production, plus the prospect of greater
exports, are expected to ensure a con-
stant rise in the total demand for coal.

COAL SUPPLEMENT
Still Major Source of Energy
Industry in sound position
\ lthough the march of technology
has caused some industries to turn
away from coal as a source of energy—
a development common throughout the
world —coal is still by far the major
energy source in Australia. It is clear,
however, that coal will not continue to
hold its present 52 per cent share of the
energy market.
According to Joint Coal Board figures,
the main competition has come from
petroleum products, such as fuel oil, and
from hydro-electricity. The share of the
energy market held by oil products that
are directly competitive with coal has
risen from 10.7 per cent in 1953-54 to
15.2 per cent in 1962-63. Hydro-electric
power has doubled its share in the same
period to 6.4 per cent last financial year.
Two traditional markets for coal—
railways and town gas—are symptomatic
of the change to the use of petroleum.
What worries the JCB most is its con-
viction that the oil industry deliberately
reduces its prices for oil in areas where
oil has no intrinsic technological advan-
tage.
Between 1958-59 and 1962-63 produc-
tion of motor spirit rose by 34 per cent
while furnace oil rose by 73.7 per cent.
The percentage of motor and aviation
spirit has declined from 36.8 per cent of
the marketable products to 33.4 per cent
while the proportion of furnace oil has
increased from 31.6 per cent to 37.2 per
cent.
The JCB does not consider nuclear
power a possibility within NSW for at
least 25 years. However, in its annual
report it quotes a report of the United
States Atomic Energy Commission
which says, in part: “Concern has been
expressed lest conversion to nuclear
power might cause severe dislocations in
the (American) coal industry and hence
on transportation, especially the rail-
roads. This is definitely not the case”.
Competition from hydro-electricity has
come mainly from the Snowy Mountains
scheme whose contribution towards the
energy market will increase in years to
come as further stages of the project
become operational.
Despite a declining share in the energy
market, the NSW coal industry is in a
sound position with sales increasing and
the likelihood of much larger export
markets just around the corner. Perhaps
competition from the oil refineries is a
little tough, but coal is winning its
battle in areas where fuel oil is hard put
to compete at any price.

Mechanisation in
NSW is
Highest in World
T>robably the most significant factor
in the rebirth of the NSW coal-
mining industry has been the extremely
high degree of mechanisation achieved
in the 91 mines now operating.
When the rehabilitation process began
15 years ago, only about 35 per cent of
the 11 million tons then produced annu-
ally was mechanically won and loaded
in the mine. Extremely arduous manual
labor produced the balance.
Today, 94 per cent of the 20 million
tons mined in NSW is won mechanically
either by machines known as continuous
miners or by a combination of coal cut-
ters, borers and shotfiring. Continuous
miners, which eat into the coal face and
then load the coal on to transport
vehicles in one operation, now account
for two-thirds of the coal produced
underground.
In loading the coal after it has been
won, mechanical equipment handles 97
per cent of the total coal loaded.
Mechanical transport of coal from
underground working places to the sur-
face has also done much to cut costs.
In NSW, 87 per cent of coal won under-
ground begins its journey to the surface
in a rubber-tyred, electrically-driven
shuttle car. The remainder is trans-
ported from the face in conveyors, mine
cars or small skips.
Once the coal reaches the main haul-
age system, 60 per cent of total produc-
tion travels on continuous belt conveyors.
Another 25 per cent is transported partly
by belt and partly by mine car, loco
haulage or rope haulage.
In the science of coal preparation, the
NSW industry, under the spur of com-
petition, has taken full advantage of the
latest technological developments to
supply consumers with a product that
conforms to tight specifications. In
1963 about 70 per cent of coal was
washed before use—an unusually high
figure in view of the use of unwashed
coal by electric power stations.
“These figures mean,” says Coal Board
chairman B. W. Hartnell, “that the NSW
coal industry is more highly mechanised
than any in the world.”

Large Export Earnings in
Next Three Years
Japan becomes our most important market
Australia’s coal export earnings in
the next 12 months are estimated at
£l6 million, rising to £23 million by
1967. Most of this will come to New
South Wales from Japan.
Emergence of a major market in Japan
has been a comparatively recent develop-
ment. In 1958 Australia supplied to
Japan only 390,000 tons, or 8.4 per cent
of total Japanese coal imports.
For 1964, the Japanese steel industry
estimates that its imports of Australian
coal will be 33 million tons, or 34.5 per
cent of total imports. By 1967, the
Japanese estimate that coal imports from
Australia will rise to 5,150,000 tons, or
41.9 per cent of
their imported sup-
plies.
The great bulk of
these tonnages will
be shipped through
Port Kembla and
Balmain, with no-
tably smaller quan-
tities coming from
Queensland.
Adjusting itself to
changing market
conditions has been
the NSW coal in-
dustry’s biggest
problem in recent
years, but while mines in some areas
have suffered loss of sales, over-all pro-
duction has been rising steadily. In fact,
the industry will sell this year about
1,500,000 tons more than last year.
The industry’s total sales in 1962-63
amounted to 17,090,000 tons, but for
1963-64 an estimated 18,510,000 tons
will be disposed of, comprising
14,370,000 tons consumed within NSW,
overseas exports of 3 million tons and
interstate sales of 1,140,000 tons.
To achieve this saleable tonnage, the
industry will produce an estimated
20,130,000 tons, the difference being
accounted for mainly by rejects at coal
preparation plants.
The significance of interstate exports
has been diminishing steadily. This
market, at just over one million tons for
1963-64, is now less than half the 1954-
55 level.
In the same period, exports overseas
have expanded tenfold to three million
tons, with no less than 2,440,000 tons
of this quantity being supplied by mines
in the Burragorang Valley and on the
South Coast, mainly to Japan and to a
small extent to New Caledonia.
Dominant in the market are the iron
and steel industry and the generation of
electricity. Between them they account
for 72 per cent of the coal consumed in
NSW, and their future plans are for
greatly increased consumption year by
year as new productive facilities are
brought in.
The iron and steel
industry, for in-
stance, will consume
5,480,000 tons in
1963-64, which is
304,000 tons higher
than in the previous
12 months. Just over
80 per cent of this
coal will come from
mines owned by the
steel industry itself.
Electricity genera-
tion in 1963-64 is
expected to consume
about 4,880,000
tons, or 625,000 tons more than in
1962-63. About 64 per cent of this coal
is currently delivered from mines owned
by State authorities.
Major expansion of the huge power
generating stations now being developed
on the coalfields south of Newcastle will
in the next few years require supplies
well beyond present consumption.
The influence of the new loader at
Port Kembla is already showing in the
size of forward contracts. Shipments
to Japan from that port in 1962-63 were
832,700 tons, but for the full calendar
year of 1964 shipments will total
1,400,000 tons.
New contracts already entered into
for shipments up to 1966-67 indicate
that by then Port Kembla shipments to
Japan will be at least 1,763,000 tons.

Japanese Delegation’s Advice
Labor costs and ash content dangers
Tt was fitting that the opening of a
coal-loading plant, built partly be-
cause of Japanese prompting, should be
attended by one of the biggest Japanese
steel industry delegations ever to come
to NSW.
And so it was at Port Kembla on
Friday, June 19, when representatives of
the Japanese steel industry, trading and
shipping companies watched Premier
Renshaw open the £5 million loader
one of the most modern in the world.
The coal loader has been built partly
because of hints by Japanese purchasers
who warned Australia that she must
remain competitive or lose markets.
Japanese steel industry representatives
said on earlier missions to Australia that
improved coal loading facilities were
essential if Australia were to compete in
the Japanese market.
The delegation arrived on June 17,
and, waiting for the official opening of
the loader, concerned themselves with
business in and around Sydney. Leader
of the group is Mr T. Tasaka, vice-presi-
dent of the Fuji Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.
He is the liaison between the Japanese
steel industry and Australian coal
producers.
Mr Tasaka said he expected that
further expansion in the Japanese steel
industry would lead to increased Aus-
tralian coal exports. “Japan is the third
biggest iron and steel producing country
in the world, following the US and
Russia,” he said. “Our output surpasses
that of West Germany.
“The expansion of the Japanese steel
industry will continue and I am
optimistic that requirements of coal and
coke from established Australian sources
will expand with us.
“The total imports of coking coal for
the Japanese steel industry now total
about ten million tons and one-third of
this comes from Australia. In 1959 we
imported 611,000 tons from Australia.
Last year we imported more than three
million tons.”
This, Mr Tasaka added, was evidence
of increasing trade and friendship
between Australia and Japan.
While Australia is increasing its coal
exports to Japan it must take into
account two factors which, despite the
new loader at Port Kembla, could
reduce its competitiveness on the Japan-
ese coal market. “These are,” said Mr
Tasaka, “a high ash content which some-
times exceeded contract limits, and a
high labor cost. A solution to labor costs
is hard to see, but more stringent checks
on the ash content could prevent penalty
charges being incurred.”
H. C. Sleigh Helped to
Build Exports
/Commencing with the first shipment of
coal to Western Australia late in the
last century, H. C. Sleigh Ltd has since
been closely connected with the coal
business in Australia.
Association with coal producers en-
abled the company to develop markets
for both New South Wales and Queens-
land coals in Japan, New Zealand, and
Central and South America.
As other opportunities occurred and
overseas markets developed, Sleigh has
rendered an increasing export service to
the coal industry. During the 12 months
ended June, 1963, the company’s coal
export trade totalled 900,000 tons. In
the current year this trade has increased
still further, and today Sleigh handles
approximately 40 per cent of all coal
exported.
Executives of the Export Division
make regular overseas visits to consoli-
date and extend export markets and
many new ones have been recently estab-
lished.
The value of the company's exports to
June 30, 1963, amounted to £5,870,000.
Besides coal, these included frozen meat,
dairy products, animal by-products and
merchandise of a general nature.
"Australia now
Really Active”
Qir Edward Warren, chairman of the
Australian Coal Association, said
the Federal and State Governments were
to be commended for building the Port
Kembla loader.
“Reports from overseas indicate that
the new terminal will substantially assist
in lifting coal exports from the southern
coalfields,” he said. “The installation is
of world standard and has been accepted
abroad as evidence that Australia is
really active in her drive to increase
exports.
“I feel that we should now hurry
along with plans to build an adequate
loading plant at Newcastle to further
trade between Australia and Japan.”

“Mud crabs are for boys, crayfish are
for men, but he who aspires to be a
hero eats scallops.” You must under-
stand that something rare and beau-
tiful has happened. Very likely it is
the best thing that has happened to
Melbourne since Baron von Mueller
designed the Botanic Gardens.
We have become the headquarters
for the scallop industry. If you’re
really crafty the thing to do is get
down on Mornington Pier at dusk,
just as the scallop boats are coming
in, then get those scallops which only
a few hours before were contentedly
scalloping on the floor of Port Phillip
Bay, take them home, fry them in
butter, and, for pure mouth-drooling
ecstasy of the palate, they have few
equals.
Until now Melbourne, apart from
the local crays, has been a wretched
place for seafood. Our oysters, alas,
have never been Sydney oysters, and
Port Phillip Bay has been good only
for snapper, mussels, herring, pilchard
and the odd flathead. Our staple diet
has been flake, the genteel piscatorial
name for shark. At times the shark
has been accused of eating Austra-
lians, but the reverse is the true story.
The ratio is at least one million
sharks to every human consumed.
Five years ago the Victorian Fisher-
ies and Wildlife Department started a
three-year survey of the floor of Port
Phillip Bay. The department charted
18 scallop beds around the bay, with
a sort of magnificent scallop head-
quarters off the shore of Dromana.
The truth of the matter is that for a
lifetime we have been getting our
scallops from Tasmania, and they
have disappeared down our gullets
mostly, and rather regrettably, en-
tombed in fried batter.
Last year the famed scallop beds
of Tasmania’s famed D’Entrecasteaux
Channel failed to yield their succu-
lent harvest. The Tasmanian scallop
boats had the encouraging news about
the Fisheries Department’s survey, so
they decided to come to Port Phillip.
At first they came in ones and twos,
and we even had such famous scallop
hunters as “Bacteria Bill”.
Words can hardly describe the un-
believable growth of the industry. It
was all rather like the gold rush of
the ’sixties. This time last year there
was just a handful of boats. By
October there were 20, and now there
are 90 boats equipped to dredge
scallops in Port Phillip. Of these at
least 50 are in action at one time.
We have been told that the scallop
industry is now making for our
fishermen £190,000 a year. We have
been told that they are scooping out
of Port Phillip five million scallops
a month. An international market
has begun with various shipments to
the UK and USA, and at this stage
France looks like being a very good
customer.
"VTaturally, all this has strained our
relations somewhat with Tasmania.
After all, Tasmania gets ugly treat-
ment at any time. Several weeks back
the London “Economist” produced a
splendid supplement on Australia.
It had very complete sections on
every State except one. “The Eco-
nomist” erred. It gave no recogni-
tion to the fact that Tasmania existed.
On the scallop affair the Chief Secre-
tary, Mr Rylah, was cruel enough to
point out that our Port Phillipian
scallops were sweeter and tastier than
Tasmanian scallops.
But this year Tasmania is fighting
back. Before, the scallop season was,
indeed, a season. It started in May
and went on for three months. But
the Victorians (always hungry) found
that their scallops maintained quality
all the year round and so hunted them
all the year. Now Tasmania, instead
of concentrating on the D’Entrecas-
teaux Channel, is going to the ocean
beds off the east coast, and the hope
is that these will make a year-round
market. The word is that the east
coast scallops—oh, let us mention it
in small type —are fatter and better
than the Phillipian scallops.
Of course, the agonising point is
this. How long will the beautiful
bonanza last? The scallop in the
raw is an attractive creature, even
better than an oil company advertise-
ment. It is a classic two-piece, fan-
shaped shell; one side flat, one curved
and hinged at the base of the fan.
It belts along by snapping the shell
open and shut, gulping in and ex-
pelling water, making a foot at every
snap. He is far from difficult to
catch.
But, according to the Fisheries
Department, monthly catches con-
tinue to rise, and at this stage there
is no sign of any depletion in the
fields. However, the department is
trying hard to keep check. In recent
weeks departmental officers have been
suffering the agonies of the bay by
skin-diving and tagging scallops in the
same way that they tag the chestnut
teal ducks and the occasional blue-
winged shoveller. Furthermore, the
department is offering rewards. For
every tagged scallop shell you find
the reward is four shillings. From
this information the experts hope to
discover the growth rate, population,
density, mortality and migration.
On your behalf I have tackled the
experts to find the best way of eating
this beautiful Melburnian delicacy.
Here is their suggestion. Buy a long
French loaf. Hollow out the soft
bread inside. Fill it with fresh scal-
lops and pieces of bacon. Put your
French loaf in the oven until it is all
sizzling and cooked. Have a bottle
of Moselle ready. Take out the French
loaf, start at one end, and quietly
chew your way through to the other.
But scallops are not the whole story.
Just recently divers have been finding
the delectable abalone around the
rocky shores of Point Cook, Mt Mar-
tha, and from Point Nepean to Won-
thaggi. This has caused such a re-
markable change that, heavens above,
quality seafood restaurants are begin-
ning to crop up around town. At
St Kilda there is the Beachcomber,
which has a dish called “The Fisher-
man’s Feast”, consisting of fillets of
fish, fried scallops, prawns and
oysters. Then at Glen Iris there is the
Bouillabaisse, where, if you order it
several days beforehand, they will
serve the genuine name dish. It's a
dreamy, gutsy, soupy, fishy stew, and
as splendidly thick as ready-mix con-
crete.

The Sphinx with a Secret
The permanent image of Greta Garbo
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Garbo Festival. Liberty Theatre.
Sydney.
The Cardinal. Director, Otto Premin-
ger. Lido and King’s Cross Metro
Theatre. Sydney.
Lilies of the Field. Director, Ralph
Nelson. Embassy Theatre. Sydney.
Ane always approaches the revival of
a Garbo film with misgivings—how
sad if she suddenly seemed outdated and
absurd! But she invariably casts her old
spell. The current season of reissues
reminds us of the durability of her
special magic. Though none of the five
is a great film, all are expertly produced,
with the lavishness and technical gloss
that were always an MGM trademark;
all have highly professional supporting
casts. Above all, they offer a showcase
for Garbo’s many-sided talent. A pity
they are such a standard and over-
familiar choice. All with the exception
of “Queen Christina” (a positive of
which was especially imported) have
been shown regularly, and at least two
have been on television. It would be
interesting to see some of the star’s less-
known vehicles, “Mata Hari”, of which
we got a tantalising glimpse in a recent
TV Garbo compilation, or “Two Faced
Woman”, for instance.
Though Garbo’s name is still synony-
mous to most people with the term
“Hollywood star”, she got there almost
by accident. The famous Swedish silent
film director Stiller refused a Hollywood
offer unless his protegee was also offered
a contract. The unwanted, unknown
Swedish actress became a legend; Stiller
returned to Sweden and obscurity.
After becoming one of the great silent
stars, Garbo easily made the transition
to sound films, which ended so many
careers. When she spoke her first line
in “Anna Christie” —“Gimme a whisky
• —ginger ale on the side, and don’t be
stingee, baby,” in her deep, musical
voice, her fans relaxed with a sigh of
relief.
She kept her high place through the
1930 s and early 19405, finally retiring
by her own choice. Recurrent rumors
that she is considering a comeback, the
last only a few weeks ago, have come
to nothing.
What is the secret of her lasting
attraction? First, her physical beauty has
nothing to do with changes in fashion;
her looks are still striking, whereas the
more modish film beauties of her day
(who featured plucked eyebrows, fluffy
permanents and black lipstick) now look
rather comical. Also Garbo's own
haunting, indefinable personality still has
its mysterious appeal.
she is an actress of remark-
able sensitivity and range; though
usually associated with romantic tragedy,
she shows in “Ninotchka” a genuine
comic flair. Above all, her profound
sincerity ennobles any script: the senti-
mentalities of “Camille” or “Anna Kare-
nina” (the film version is more reminis-
cent of “East Lynne” than of Tolstoi)
become high tragedy in her hands, and
even in the light comedy of “Ninotchka”
she gives a moving picture of a woman
awakening to love.
Though in her heyday many studios
hopefully imported enigmatic foreign
actresses, Garbo never had any success-
ful imitators nor, in her own particular
field, any serious rivals. She was, and
remains, unique.
Otto Preminger’s mammoth film “The
Cardinal” has his usual strengths and
weaknesses. His style is always pedes-
trian, but he chooses stories so full of
incident that one can usually overlook
the ponderous development.
Here there is almost a plethora of inci-
dent, for Henry Morton Robinson,
author of “The Cardinal”, seems deter-
mined to include every possible human
experience with the exception of being
shot out of a cannon. The priest in the
film has to face among other things
Fascism, race prejudice, the problems of
mixed marriage and the question whether
in the case of a dangerous pregnancy
the life of the child or the mother should
be spared—the last complicated by the
fact that the woman in labor is his sister.
Preminger is obviously not committed
in a religious sense to his subject, and
concentrates on telling his story without
comment, only showing personal en-
thusiasm in the scenes of internal
Vatican politics politics of any sort
being one of his few genuine interests.
Tom Tryon was hardly an inspired
choice for the title role, and meets all
his tribulations with an unaltered ex-
pression of monolithic calm. Of the
rest of a highly competent cast, John
Huston's rumbustious portrait of an
Irish-American Cardinal is outstanding.
Ralph Nelson’s “Lilies of the Field”
again has a religious background, but
it's concerned more with human love
and interdependence. This story of a
Negro drifter who almost unwillingly
helps a group of refugee nuns to build
a chapel is oversimplified and senti-
mental, but has genuine charm; and
the script has enough astringent lines to
prevent it from being unbearably saccha-
rine.
Most of all, Sidney Poitier's perform-
ance gives it value. He gives astonishing
solidity to a character which could easily
have been a mere stock sketch of the
comical, decent Negro.
Urgency and
Escapism
Eleventh Sydney Film Festival. Uni-
versity of Sydney.
HThe conventional comment on the 1964
Sydney Film Festival was —as usual
—that it was not as good as in other
years. This view may have gained im-
petus from the fact that the best feature
films did not come on to the screens until
the second weekend. But, seen as a
whole, I think the programme stood up
well against those of earlier years.
The last few days of the festival pro-
vided Stanley Kubrick's brilliantly out-
rageous “nightmare comedy” about
nuclear war, “Dr Strangelove”, and a
gently poetic domestic semi-comedy from
Japan, Ozu’s “An Autumn Afternoon”.
Both of these were eminently festival-
worthy, and to them should almost cer-
tainly be added Antonioni’s “II Grido”,
which I was unable to see but which
reliable witnesses tell me was one of the
major experiences of the festival.
Then there were those feature films
whose success was less absolute, but
which still had merits that made them
well worth looking at and talking about,
such as “Hands Over the City” (director,
Francesco Rosi), an Italian drama which
took up the subject of municipal cor-
ruption with convincing realism but


Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OF IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on — the strain gets tougher
-—• the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder — so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life — tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol — often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins — B1 in
particular — which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly

failed to find a sufficiently firm dramatic
structure.
One of the disappointments of the
festival was the mainly unexciting repre-
sentation of eastern European feature
films, occasioning the trite but inevitable
observation that the film makers of the
Communist countries seem to have all
the talent and technique one could wish
for but are sadly restricted in their
subject matter.
The urgent topicality of “Dr Strange-
love” and “Hands Over the City” was
in sharp contrast to the Polish, Czech
and Hungarian retreat to World War II
subjects (“Eroica”, “Passengers”, “Trans-
port from Paradise”), social struggles of
the past (the Hungarian “Land of
Angels” and fantasy (as in the often
charming but too slow and lengthy Czech
film “That Cat”). The one field in
which the Russian and satellite film
makers always seem to score, the trans-
lation to the screen of literary classics,
was represented only by Wajda's “Sibe-
rian Lady Macbeth”, already reviewed.
In one respect at least, I feel, this
festival programme topped previous ones:
that is in the quality and variety of the
best of the short films. These showed
the extent to which non-fiction film
makers have cast aside the earnest docu-
mentary in favor of fantasy, satire,
visual poetry or sheer nonsense. I would
single out —not necessarily as the best,
but as representative of various cate-
gories—the Polish “Labyrinth” for in-
genuity, the Brazilian “Skin of a Cat”
for humanity, the Dutch “Sailing” for
visual beauty and the English “The
Apple” for simple goonery.
This is not to suggest that all the
non-feature films were good; inevitably
there was a proportion of junk, and em-
barrassingly an unequal proportion of
this was Australian. It was baffling, for
example, that Australia's Commonwealth
Film Unit should be represented only by
a dully functional compilation like
“Music in the Making”. And even
those Australian films that could be
called worthy and promising still seem to
be decades behind those from other
countries in style and expertise.
In a prosperous country of 11 million
people, much in need of telling the world
of our existence, why can't we make
films that are at least half as good as
those from, say, Denmark?

spiritual father. Kemp, French, Craw-
ford, Johnson and Senbergs as a school
provide the first alternative to the image
in Melbourne painting. They are a
strong group, concerned with style and
the expression of ideas often mystical.
Among them Senbergs more than holds
his own for he achieves communication.
Senbergs’ symbols are not so per-
sonal that you need him to explain the
meaning of the picture to you. We can
recall the worlds of his pictures and
test his ideas. He uses shapes—long,
blocky, arched, domed —to comment on
three inter-relating worlds. One is
peopled by tight family groups, rigid,
authoritarian and uncommunicative,
about which you wonder. Another relates
to those people as individuals.
Senbergs paints a patriarch that is as
well the top part of a machine, but is a
tower ruling a town. This would be
clever but nothing at all if it were not
for the genuine sense of mystery you
feel before these paintings. His ideas
are first bounded by drawing and then
further controlled by the restraint im-
posed by the quick-drying enamel
medium. This restricts the gestures
he may make with paint, imposing
its rigidity on forms in the pictures.
Senbergs’ recent paintings have become
looser, less hard-edged, and paint, tone
and color are used more sensuously than
before.
In tone the pictures are dark. The
few light colors in them act on the
general scheme of blacks and browns,
giving richness. The pictures relate
closely to his silk screen prints and to
the technique in printing, of using one
flat color over another. The smooth
enamel of Senbergs’ 1963 Rubinstein
entries has given way to a rougher,
tougher surface quality. His new pic-
tures are painted over a built-up ground
of Polyfast. Ridges beneath the surface
catch the light and where he does not
want the surface to shine he dulls it
with powdered pumice.
Senbergs has everything in his favor.
He is a young, serious painter working
in a strong school. He is producing
pictures whose tough poetry retains its
quality from one picture to the next,
and should endure in any particular pic-
ture for a long time.

A Matter
of Language
Much Ado About Nothing. William
Shakespeare. Genesian Theatre.
Sydney.
The Duchess of Malfi. John Webster.
Recently at Wesley College. Sydney
University.
Oeeing these two productions on con-
secutive nights brought home to me
very forcibly that drama, especially
Elizabethan drama, is above all a matter
of words. To “speak the speech . . .
trippingly on the tongue”, as Hamlet
requested the Players, is more important
than anything else. We Australians, with
our flat, unmodulated voices and charac-
teristic inarticulateness, have great diffi-
culty in speaking feelingly, which is the
essence of dramatic speech. Returning
to Sydney after a number of years in
Melbourne, I have noticed that the Syd-
ney voice is much flatter than the Mel-
bourne voice, so that the standard of
speaking in amateur dramatic produc-
tions is correspondingly lower in Sydney.
Margaret Rieneck’s modest but careful
production of “Much Ado” had the vir-
tue of being clearly spoken. It also
obeyed the second axiom of Shake-
spearean production: that the action
should be rapid and continuous, unim-
peded by elaborate scene-changes. Most
of the action was played against a
pleasant backdrop by Alexander Rieneck
picturing a harbor complete with Eliza-
bethan sailing ships.
“Much Ado” is one of those plays of
Shakespeare in which the arbitrary events
of fairy-tale or “romance” are strangely
mixed with vivid realism. Beatrice and
Benedict and the comic citizens —Dog-
berry and the Watch—seem very much
alive, but Claudio, Hero, the Prince and
his brother, Don John the Bastard, are
stylised characters having a mediaeval re-
moteness. The fact that Coralie Camp-
bell gave us a very lively Beatrice, well
matched by Laurie Butler’s Benedict,
only emphasised the unreality of the
others, who were not well played, with
the exception of Mary Pusey’s Hero.
This production, the first in a series
“The Three Faces of Shakespeare”, cele-
brating Shakespeare’s Quatercentenary,
has now been replaced by “Richard III”,
which will be followed by “Antony and
Cleopatra”.
“The Duchess of Malfi” is a ram-
shackle melodrama, lacking in psycho-
logical or moral coherence, but shot
through with the diamond glitter of
poetry. Rarely produced, it presents for-
midable problems, but one thing is cer-
tain: the play must be well spoken, so
that not one metaphor is missed. But,
with the exception of H. Leventhal as
Bosola, the melancholy villain, and
Kerry James as Cariola, the Lady-in-
Waiting, the standard of speaking of the
Wesley College Players was appallingly
low.
David Ferraro’s production was highly
ambitious, but in spite of the evident
energy, enthusiasm and ingenuity of all
concerned, it seemed ,o me to be almost
wholly misguided. The platform stage
in the middle of the stately Wesley
College Dining Hall should nave per-
mitted a rapid and uncluttered perform-
ance, but I have never seen a production
so much in need of a picture-frame stage
to hold it together. The platform was
augmented by two Elizabethan “houses”.
Apart from the absurdity of the charac-
ters running up and down these struc-
tures like the mouse in "Hickory,
Dickory, Dock”, the effect on audibility
was disastrous. Worse still, ladies and
gentlemen of the Court of Malfi stood
about the hall in front of the audience,
blocking both sight and sound. It felt
more like audience obliteration than
audience participation. And yet, al-
though this was an example of how
not to produce “The Duchess of Malfi”,
there was something heroic about the
attempt.
These amateur productions should
shame the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
which, in this year of world-wide cele-
bration of Elizabethan drama, has man-
aged to stage one Shakespeare play!

Hoarding up the Past
Elizabeth Bowen and the theme of her transience
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Little Girls. Elizabeth Bowen.
Cape. 265.
Bowen has a long and dis-
tinguished record as a novelist. “The
Death of the Heart”, with its precise
and penetrating analysis of personal re-
lationships, and its finely drawn moral of
the world, the flesh and the devil, is per-
haps her most memorable achievement.
Yet even “The Death of the Heart” did
not translate her into the rarefied atmos-
phere of academic distinction. Surely
one of the oddest and most inconsistent
critical habits is that of conferring aca-
demic status upon certain novelists.
Joyce, Lawrence and now Faulkner are
unquestionably “in”. Virginia Woolf
and Forster at the moment seem to
be losing some ground; and there
may yet develop between them an
undignified shuffle for a place. Joyce
Cary hovers uncertainly on the edge of
respectability; whereas Hemingway’s
claims, which year by year appear more
flimsy, have never been seriously chal-
lenged. And now Patrick White has
successfully elbowed his way into the
austere society of authors upon whom,
year after year, examination questions
have to be set.
Why not Elizabeth Bowen too? Per-
haps it could be that she at least gives
the impression of following where others
have led. Technically speaking, “The
Death of the Heart” is accomplished
without being “experimental”. Miss
Bowen has profited by the more daring
attempts of her predecessors and con-
temporaries, but at the same time has
sought, and I would suppose found, a
wider audience. In her most recent novel,
“The Little Girls”, her technical re-
sources seem to me to have failed her;
the direction of the novel is not so much
obscure as uncertain; and one’s interest
in the plot and characters flickers on
and off like a light globe at the end of
its life.
“The Little Girls” begins promisingly
enough underground, where Dinah Pig-
gott is busy collecting from a wide circle
of friends and acquaintances “things (a
dozen from each) which they couldn’t
have normally borne to part with.” Her
object is to seal them up in her cave for
posterity. Or, as she puts it, the objects
are “Clues to reconstruct us from. Ex-
pressive objects.” And she asks “What
really expresses people? The things, I’m
sure, that they have obsessions about:
keep on wearing or using, or fuss when
they lose, or can’t go to sleep without.”
Some people, she discovers, are very
happy to part' with their “expressive
objects”, glad, as she suspects, to get
them out of their systems. From
this fanciful beginning the novel
begins to move back into the past.
Dinah, at the end of her day’s acti-
vities in the cave, is suddenly posses-
sed by that familiar sensation of having
experienced all this before. She recalls
that as a child of eleven, she and two
school friends buried a box, and with it,
apart from a few bones, a message in
an Unknown Language, and a few other
trivial objects, a secret personal object.
Now, over forty years later, Dinah be-
comes obsessed with the notion that she
must find her friends; and that she must
disinter her own past and theirs, and
the relationship in which they stood to
each other.
do meet. They feel their way tow-
ards a shared past acros the wilder-
ness of years that divides their maturity
from their childhood. Some of the most
convincing chapters in the novel are
those in the middle section (the book
is divided into three “movements”)
where Elizabeth Bowen recreates their
school days and tells the story of the
burial of the coffer. In this section she
creates the curiously distorted world of
childish observation; the world in which
certain sensations and objects which in
later life may not even be recalled, are
of overwhelming significance; the world
in which the mere glance of an adult
may communicate to a child knowledge
beyond its years.
In the end the three witches (“Mac-
beth” is more than once invoked) dig
up their ancient coffer, to find it empty.
And little remains for the plot to do. We
are told what each girl buried —one a
copy of Shelley, one a toe (her own,
since she was born with six on one foot,
and had kept the amputated relic in a
bottle), and Dinah herself, a revolver,
which she found in her mother's drawer,
but which was not used as a suicide
weapon by her father, who instead threw
himself under a train. Finally, as a
result of her investigations, Dinah has
what is described as a nervous break-
down, the external sign of which is an
enormous bruise on her forehead.
It is not difficult to make suggestions
about the theme of the book, which
might be seen as a series of questions.
What is change? Answer (on p. 177),
“there is seldom anything convulsive
about change. What is there, is there;
there comes to be something fictitious
about what is not”. What is the past?
Is it like the coffer, empty? How do
people feel? Answer (on p. 193),
“People are glad to feel anything that’s
already been fabricated for them to feel”.
Would it be better to have no record
of the past? Answer (on p. 195), “It
might be better to have no pictures of
places which are gone”. Do we all need
some shelter against ourselves and
others? These are good questions, and
there are more of them. But their
answers are not built into the novel; they
lie, exposed and somewhat self-conscious,
on its surface; and not even the strenu-
ous efforts of Miss Bowen to provide
them with a verbal covering can hide
their nakedness.
The impression left by “The Little
Girls” is, then, one of strain. Sentences
are tortured and twisted out of shape,
so that often even the simplest state-
ment becomes syntactically ambiguous.
“Successful search having been made for
tea-cloths wherewith to grip the now
red-hot handles of metal teapots, a
brimming cup, or for juniors a mug of
milk, soon found its way into every
hand.” It is difficult to escape the feel-
ing that Miss Bowen has thought less
about the substance of her statement
than about how to decorate it; and that
the many technical flourishes point to
confusion rather than profundity. One
of the symbols in the novel is a butter
knife, bought by Dinah from one of the
girls. She appeases the gods in tradi-
tional fashion by exchanging a coin for
it. And she writes to her friend, “And
you need not worry if it is a symbol,
as practically everything is, as we now
know. Certainly everything is in your
witch’s kitchen, as your customers
know?” Miss Bowen's customers cannot
easily forget that they are buying sym-
bols by the dozen —caves, knives, dogs,
coffers, bones, chains, and even, I sup-
pose, that pickled sixth toe. But they
might be pardoned for wondering, as
they hand over their money, whether
they are not having their legs pulled as
well.

and for long perhaps the coldest and
most unwelcoming Royal residences in
Britain. Also the most enduring.
William the Conqueror selected the
site at Windsor, with a steep escarp-
ment on one side and the Thames on
another, for one of his strategic earth-
work fortresses guarding London.
Henry II rendered it in stone but in its
original butterfly form —a lower and
upper bailey centreing on a middle ward
with a mound and donjon keep, the
whole guarded by palisade and moats
on the sides on which there was no
cliff and entered by inner and outer
drawbridges. Edward 111, building the
Round Tower as a refectory for the
Round Table about which he intended
to gather a new Arthurian chivalry,
completed its original rather disparate
form and gave it mystical significance
through making it the temple and habitat
of the Order of the Garter with its
25 Knights and Knights Attendants, its
canons and its Dean housed in the
Lower Ward as they still are round the
Chapel of St George and the Albert
Memorial (Henry Vll's) Chapel.
St George's Chapel owes its glories
with the quaintness of the adjoining
Horseshoe Cloister to Edward IV.
Save for interludes in which Engleard
de Cicogne defended it for King John
against the onslaughts of the barons’
catapults, the Wars of the Roses, the
Civil War of the Stuarts, the events of
Windsor’s long history have been in the
main those of jousting and pageantry, the
chase and human tragedy with some
comedy thrown in. It has seen King
Henry II at tourney, King John feasting
his guests on eels and almonds and 6000
gallons of wine at Christmastide. It has
seen the splendid ever-changing, but
basically enduring ceremonies of the
Garter year after year for centuries.
It has visioned the Black Prince
coming home from the wars, and Prince
Philip cooking his own breakfast in an
electric frying pan and going off to
Ascot with a transistor in his grey topper
so as to be able to furtively “listen to
the cricket”. It has heard the trumpets
of the Angevins, George 111 playing his
flute and Queen Victoria her piano. And
almost everybody who has been great
in Europe and who has come to England
has walked its corridors. It has welcomed
Czars, Shahs, Commissars, Fanny Bur-
ney, the gifted authoress of “Evelina”,
and African lions.
It entombs some of our greatest kings
in varying circumstances—Edward IV
in some pomp, Henry VIII drawn in
regal splendor by eight black horses at
the head of a four mile cortege all the
way from Westminster; Charles I, head-
less, borne furtively through the snow
into St George’s Chapel in the dark of
night.
A long line of Surveyors of Works
have tended it —William of Wykeham,
Chaucer, Wren, Wyatt and the ultimate
Wyattville who did credit to the Regency
by rendering it out of a tatterdemalion
state —brought about by disorderly
carving up and pulling down and re-
building—into a Gothic whole, despite
the howls of Parliament at having to find
the million pounds his Royal Master, the
“first gentleman in Europe”, had him
spend upon it. He gave it machicola-
tions when there was no longer need to
pour boiling lead from the towers upon
visitors and drawbridge slots when
drawbridges were out of fashion. He
even incorporated the painted glass from
demolished Carlton House graciously
offered to him, remarking that he “cud
pleace soom of ut, though ’ee ’ad not
joust thin dixed wheer”.
]Y|R Hibbert is more concerned with the
denizens of Windsor —some of them
could scarcely be termed inhabitants
since they were about as savage and un-
controlled as the feral animals in its
zoo —than with its structure though he
sketches its reconstructions and its
periods of dilapidation and neglect. Cer-
tainly he has had no lack of arresting
material in the Courts of Elizabeth, of
Charles the Second living there with Nell
Gwynne and Lady Castlemaine and his
tiny Queen at one and the same time,
and with George 111 in his various roles
of Farmer George and Mad George and
his extraordinary sons who brought all
their mistresses and offsprings to live
in the Castle, as occasion seemed to
demand, and are two a penny in Wind-
sor’s history. Royal epileptics, Royal
man-mountains and mountainesses who
had to be hauled up staircases with
“machines” or let down through trap-
doors in ceilings, Kings who kissed their
male staffs with ardor, but who univer-
sally proved how dull vice and kingship
can be, move through his pages in swift
succession. Scandal and lechery join
hands in the tale with simple kindness,
and naive beneficence, eke with blackmail
and wanton extravagance and splendor.
Mr Hibbert is even able to produce one
Georgian Prince strongly suspected of
murdering his valet, and residents who
themselves were suspected of being
murdered.
At a moment when it is being sug-
gested that Royalty may be driven from
its modest setting at Buckingham Palace
by crowds and the overlooking of win-
dows in skyscraper flats to make Windsor
its permanent home, the great thirteen
acre series of palaces and chapels, of
state apartments and vast walks and
gardens, has a special interest. With its
twenty towers, from the tallest of which
it is said that twelve counties can be
seen on a clear day, it is a staggering
treasure house of art, a museum of
which sightseers from all over the world
never tire as they plod its opulent rooms

Mary Baker Eddy. Her Communica-
tions from Beyond the Grave to
Harold Horwood, AMIEE, through
the mediumship of Ursula Roberts.
Max Parrish. 15s. 9d.
A staunchly anti-Wesley congregation
in the eighteenth century cast a new
church bell bearing the noble inscription:
“Hurrah for the Church of England and
down with Enthusiasm”. I knew per-
sonally the illustrious Australian scholar
who offended an eminent C of E bishop
with his remark: “Sir, I am not a
Christian. I am an Anglican”. Were
there not a profound core of truth in
anecdotes like these, people like Mary
Baker Eddy would either remain pious
members of their natal religions (Con-
gregational in her case) or win as fol-
lowers a mere handful of cranks—their
alleged new religions would perish with
them.
Norman Beasley’s biography dis-
closes a very remarkable woman. Her
own ability as a “healer” cannot always
be lightly dismissed, and she (and her
followers) have managed to transmit, or
foster, “healing’’ powers in succeeding
generations of Christian Scientists. Some
of their claims are easily explained away
by sceptics like me, but apparently
authenticated cases of overnight cures
of indubitable fractures are more diffi-
cult to account for. Mrs Eddy was also
notable for charm, intelligence, energy; a
shrewd and far-sighted grasp of events
and human behavior and business affairs,
and for dignified showmanship along
with genuine simplicity.
Mrs Baker Eddy was fortunate in
being born in the best place and best era
for the propagation of her ideas. The
American middle-classes of her time
were no more ignorant than their British
counterparts, but, as a whole, less sophis-
ticated. Dickens’ novels can remind us
of the “bone-pointing” atmosphere in
which our forebears lived. Not only
fragile consumptives died in Dickensian
declines, but guilt-ridden he-men. And
despite great surgical advances their
physicians knew too little of pathological,
let alone psychological, causes to help
them much.
Mrs Eddy arrived on a scene already
well supplied with quacks and faith-
healers, bone-setters and homeopathic
doctors, and had it not been for her over-
whelming Christian convictions she
would probably have attained some local
fame and fortune as an honest lay healer,
but have been forgotten after she died.
She differed from most of her contem-
porary confreres not only in honesty but
in her firm belief that when Christ
ordered his disciples to “heal the sick
and raise the dead” he meant exactly
that. She believed that healing by belief
in God's ability to perform seeming
miracles through dedicated human be-
ings was an exact science. “Mrs Eddy”,
Beasley says, “never permitted the taking
of notes by students. She learned early
that words of instruction could not be-
come careless words. Inasmuch as she
was teaching a science, an exactness in
language was a requirement . . . Holding
a Bible in her left hand, using her right
hand and her voice for emphasis, and
slowly walking back and forth in front
of her class, Mrs Eddy never closed an
instruction period until every question
was answered correctly. To make sure
the student understood, no matter how
long it took, she called the roll and
repeated the questions, one by one, until
she was satisfied with all the answers.”
Beasley's biography is not a model of
its kind—although himself not a
Christian Scientist he is a warm apolo-
gist for the religion and I imagine that
his accounts of civil and religious
calumnies, litigations, splits and factions
are reasonably full and correct. What is
probably correct, but a good deal less
than full, is his account of Mrs Baker
Eddy as a person. (Her adoption of an
adult as her son is dismissed in a foot-
note.) Her relationship with her own
son, tragically parted from her in his
infancy but far from lost to her ken, is
very inadequately sketched. One could
multiply instances. Beasley is strong in
careful accounts of her writings, her
organisation of the new Church, and so
forth. Her constant amendments to
her basic teachings, all aimed at greater
precision, are well described and inter-
esting to read. By the fiftieth edition
of “Science and Health (1890)” most of
her writing was stabilised, but she altered
two chapter titles: The erstwhile
“Christian Science and Spiritualism” be-
came “Christian Science versus Spiritua-


lism” and “Animal Magnetism” became
“Animal Magnetism Unmasked”.
I have not read “Science and Health”
but I assume from these alterations of
chapter titles that Mrs Baker Eddy would
have found “Mary Baker Eddy—Her
Communications from Beyond the
Grave” as silly as I do. The medium
here has spirit guides called, if you
please, Ramadahn (an Eastern philoso-
pher) and Mananaman (a Central
European purveyor of personal messages
to those present at the seances). Mrs
Eddy was known to those spooks as
“Mary”. I had marked numerous idiotic
assertions to quote here, but as convinced
-spiritualists can never be unconvinced
by any logic, and as the whole thing, on
looking at it again, is exceedingly boring,
I shall spare Bulletin readers and end
here.

Asian Annual
1964 Year Book of the Far Eastern
Economic Review, Hong Kong.
Anybody interested in East and South
Asia will read with great interest
this comprehensive and detailed review
of developments. The emphasis is mainly
on economic and business developments,
but the important social and political
changes are also dealt with, since they
provide the framework within which
business and the economy is carried on.
In the survey of the region as a whole,
special chapters deal with shipping,
aviation (a spreading network), tourism,
foodgrains, oilseeds, sugar, tea, jute,
rubber, mining (steady progress, bar
Indonesia), oil, textiles (the first
“Geneva” year) and money and bank-
ing. Each of the twenty-five countries
is discussed under the headings of poli-
tics, foreign relations, social affairs, eco-
nomy, finance, trade, agriculture, in-
dustry and power and transport. In the
Trade sub-section the latest statistics are
set out with some analysis by partner
and commodity group. Monthly econo-
mic indicator tables for the fourteen
major non-Communist countries give an
excellent picture of developments of the
last three years.
There is a short review of the work
in 1963 of the United Nations Econo-
mic Commission for Asia and the Far
East (ECAFE) and of the work done
under the Colombo Plan; the various
projects and cultural co-operation of
the Association of South-east Asia (ASA)
which unites Malaysia, Thailand and
the Philippines are also dealt with.
This highly informative and easily
readable 1964 Year Book has more than
sixty photographs, well over 120 tables
and charts, and a great number of inter-
esting and up-to-date maps.

Today and Yesterday
KING THE ADVENTURER
HThe Postmaster-General, Mr Hulme,
announced in recent weeks the
issue of two new postage stamps—one
for £1 and the other for 7s. 6d. bear-
ing respectively the portraits of
Captain Cook and Rear-Admiral
Phillip Parker King, the eldest
legitimate son of Governor Philip
Gidley King who gave him his first
name after Governor Phillip who be-
came his godfather. King the elder
had founded the settlement at Nor-
folk Island at the end of February,
1788. Two years later he was sent
post haste to England via Java to
apprise the Home Government of the
sad state of the New South Wales
settlement following the failure of the
Guardian storeship to arrive and the
wreck of HMS Sirius.
He returned to the island in 1791,
voyaging out to Sydney in HMS Gor-
gon (Captain John Parker) with his
new wife —his cousin Anna Josepha
Coombe —whom he had married on
March 15 just before they sailed at
St Martin's-in-the-Fields. They were
convoying the Third Botany Bay
Fleet. It was a race between Norfolk
Island and young Phillip Parker King
who was eventually born in the
draughty twenty-four by twelve
Government House a fortnight after
they had somehow rowed his mother
ashore through the turbulent surf that
hemmed the island in. He spent his
infancy there till his father took his
gout and his family back to England
in the Britannia and Contractor in
1796. There he stayed at school with
the Revd Peter Burford at Stratford
until he joined the Navy as a volun-
teer, fifteen years old in 1807.
Young King’s early life in the Navy
was adventurous. He established a
reputation for daring and gallantry in
boat actions in the Channel off the
coast of France in 1808-9, became
a master’s mate in the Hibernia in
1810, and went on service in a very
lively Mediterranean.
He was commissioned lieutenant in
HMS Trident in 1814. Lord Bathurst
three years later chose him to com-
plete the surveys of North and North
West Australia begun by Flinders.
In the next four years King made
several historic voyages, taking with
him at the outset, among others,
Allan Cunningham, Roe and the
quaint Bungaree who had sailed with
Flinders and who was to be seen
about Sydney later in one of Governor
Macquarie’s old uniforms, imitating
his courtly bow.
King surveyed the North West
Coast and discovered Port Essington
for a start. He visited and surveyed
Macquarie Harbour discovered by the
adventurous Kelly. He traversed the
Australian East Coast to the Torres
Straits from Sydney, deducing en
route the existence of the Tweed
River and amplifying Flinders’s sur-
vey of the route to Torres Straits
inside the Barrier Reef of which he
became the first champion against the
claims of the open sea route through
the Coral Sea.
Tn subsequent voyages in the 170-ton
Bathurst he discovered the Liver-
pool River, Hanover Bay and King
Sound where Derby stands, later
named after him-by Lieutenant Stokes
of the Beagle. His two volumes
describing his extensive surveys
covering thousands of miles of Aus-
tralian coastline published in 1827
are collectors’ pieces today.
He was next sent to command the
Adventure in which, with the Beagle,
he surveyed the coasts of South
America. His narrative of this service
he and Captain Fitzroy published in
1830, the year he retired with post
captain’s rank to Australia. Later he
became Resident Commissioner of the
Australian Agricultural Company’s
vast domains. He established a
family connection with the company
which persisted through his son, who
succeeded him, and his descendants
for over a century.
He was a member of the Legisla-
tive Council from 1839 onwards and
died in February, 1856.
He was the first Australian-born
Fellow of the Royal Society, the first
also, 1 think, native Fellow of the
Linnaean Society and the first native
of the continent, first officially men-
tioned as Australia in connection with
his initial voyage of discovery, to
become a Rear-Admiral in the Royal
Navy.

More Marriages in Motors?
The struggle for motor markets in Europe has been given
a new wrench by American Chrysler which offered to
purchase one-third of Rootes’ ordinary shares and 50 p.c.
of the non-voting shares. The logic of the proposed merger
—with Chrysler able to sell the Imp and Sunbeam Alpine
in the US and the Simca and the Sunbeam Alpine in Europe—-
could stimulate further amalgamations in the motor industry.
Chrysler can offer its very successful Valiant to bolster
Rootes’ 10 p.c. share of the UK market and gain a much
wider distributorship for all vehicles," including a foot in the
European Free Trade Association camp of seven countries
and another foot in the Common Market camp of six (and
possibly seven) nations.
Automatically, the question is asked if Rootes (Aust.) Ltd,
whose 10s. shares languish below par, will gain by any asso-
ciation with Chrysler in Australia and so avoid the heavy
capital expenditure required to broaden its manufacture of
local components, as it currently relies heavily on the import
of completely knocked-down vehicles. The parent companies
doubtless could arrange some economies in Australia without
an actual merger of local interests.
If the Kennedy Round succeeds in breaking down the
29 p.c. tariff on cars now existing in the Common Market
area, Chrysler will want to share some of the spoils with the
other big two, General Motors and Ford, which already hold
12 p.c. and 32 p.c. respectively of the UK market and 24 p.c.
and 16 p.c. respectively of the German market.
Chrysler, which gained a controlling interest in Simca last
year, has a good launching pad in France, where it already
holds 22 p.c. of the market.
Ford saw the possibilities in
1960, when it gained full con-
trol of Ford UK and planned
to use it as a base for Common
Market exploitation when Brit-
ain joined tne EEC. Although
Britain did not join, Ford
hasn’t done so badly with its
UK-produced models, illustrated
by the excellent sales of the
Ford Cortina, which has been
shipped to America as well as
other markets.
General Motors, which also
gets up early, is doing the same
thing with the British-built
Vauxhall Viva, which is ship-
ped to overseas markets, in-
cluding Canada.
The small-car field has be-
come intensely competitive, as
has been startlingly evident in
Australia these last couple of
years, and Rootes certainly
should not lose by a tie-up with
Chrysler The advantage will
extend to the integration of
Money Market Dealers
The Reserve Bank has removed the limit on toral loans which
may be accepted in the short-term money market. Individual
dealers’ acceptances will be geared to their shareholders’
funds. The graph shows these funds (at last balance date)
for five of the nine market dealers , set against the book value
of authorised securities held. This would correspond closely
to the volume of loans able to be taken. (See story, page 58.)
Dodge trucks with Commer and Karrier trucks, a trend
already exploited by Massey-Ferguson in Britain.
This rationalisation trend is expected to extend, and there
have been reports from London that Chrysler is not finished
yet with its merger offers.
Some of the others may attempt to close ranks and it has
been suggested that BMC and Leyland could very well join
hands, or that either of them could make overtures to Jaguar
and Rover. There is no end to the speculation, including
efforts from some of the remaining US producers (like Stude-
baker and American Motors) to make a grab for a European
partner.
Back home in Australia, the Commonwealth Government's
moves to encourage 95 p.c. use of local components in vehicle
manufacture could cause an integration of assembly and manu-
facturing plants, so the trend is definitely towards bigness and
togetherness for economy’s sake.
The Kennedy Round
in Circles
Tf ever a prospective conference on tariffs was floated on
-*■ doubts, ifs and hot air, the Kennedy Round is it. Every-
one seems to be clutching grimly to his purse, fearing the
worst but hoping for the best.
Agriculture is a keystone to any liberalisation of trade,
because the primary-producing nations cannot afford to buy
manufactured goods from the big industrialists unless they
get a fair price for agricultural
items.
And the agricultural policy
ot the Common Market cur-
rently is up in the air, follow-
ing this month s failure by the
EEC Council of Ministers to
fix a target for European grain
prices to operate from 1966-67.
The decision was postponed
until December, but the Ken-
nedy Round begins shortly.
The West Germans won’t
agree to a reduction in grain
prices (probably noi before the
1965 elections) This not only
causes some back-biting in the
Common Market (with France
wanting to be the cheap grocer
in Europe) but it is now being
suggested that, unless the Ken-
nedy Round of tariff reductions
is placed before Congress by
the end of 1965, it could go by
default.
Meanwhile, if the trade
negotiations are discussed with-
out some agreement on agri-


culture, it is difficult to the primary-producing nations
committing themselves in the dark. They will not be inclined
to believe there is something in this for everyone.
Short-term Money Market
Under New Rules
HHhe short-term money market has behaved quite sedately
since the Reserve Bank took away the limits on accept-
able funds early in June. At that time, one or two practition-
ers felt a little apprehensive lest some highly competitive
empire-building for deposits would begin among some of the
nine authorised dealers.
They are now willing to admit that, in the face of a still-
flourishing liquidity throughout the economy, the Reserve
appears to have relaxed conditions at a seasonally correct
moment. No immediate snowballing of loans is now to be
expected.
Indeed, last week, total funds in the market dipped by £4.7
million to £158.3 million —well below the previously permitted
£IBO million, which amount may have been occasionally reach-
ed in trading.
Though the restriction over bank funds allowable in the
money market has also gone, the Reserve’s continuing dis-
cipline directly affects the individual dealers. Their possible
acceptances are geared to the volume of shareholders’ funds.
At present, a moderately flexible ratio of around 25 to one
will apparently be applied. This looks tolerably close to the
level which most dealers have recognised in the past, as the
graph on the previous page, covering five dealer-companies,
suggests. It should be remembered that the graph is based
upon balance-sheet details as at June 30, 1963.
The market mostly contains call money and observers are
waiting with interest to see the effect on term deposits of the
banks’ recently acquired capacity to pay up to 3J p.c. for
deposits of £50,000 or more made for periods between 30 days
and three months.
Just after the latest relaxations, some financial sources again
flew a kite for the discounting of commercial paper by the
short-term market. The market now is limited to holding
Government securities with currency three years or less.
The extension looks some distance away yet, most operators
seem to think. The banks will presumably remain the prin-
cipal discounters of commercial bills.
Some money-market operators, however, envisage the grad-
ual development of an- unofficial bill market, which will ulti-
mately be given Reserve Bank approval and support.
Indonesia Weaves Erratic
Economic Path
HPhe affair of the Vauxhall buses is but another example of
Indonesia’s economic tightrope act, already more than
sufficiently complicated by Malaysian confrontation, the pro-
claimed goal of nationalising foreign-owned businesses and a
fearsome pressure from domestic inflation.
To vociferous UK Press consternation. Britain’s Vauxhall
Motors, now wholly owned by General Motors of USA, has
secured a financially-impeccable contract to provide Indonesia
with 1000 lorry and bus chassis. The deal comes through
only six months after the pro-Malaysia British Government
succeeded in convincing two large English companies, Decca
and Westland, not to supply equipment for the Indonesian
Army.
As if further to confuse the outsider (or potential trader),
news is at hand from Djakarta that a Dutch group, Van
Doorne’s Automobile Fabriek, proposes to establish an
Indonesian motor industry. Van Doorne makes both cars
and commercial vehicles. The company has already discussed
details with Indonesian authorities.
Resumption of extensive commercial connections between
Indonesia and Holland looks quite likely at the moment. A
particularly striking instance is furnished by Philips Incan-
descent Lamps’ agreement to help an Indonesian electrical
industry produce not only lamps, but television, radio and
telecommunications equipment. Philips, of course, suffered
Government confiscation following Indonesian independence.
All Indonesian international dealings are bedevilled by a
great lack of credit, apart from any extreme political gestures.
Even here the Dutch Government seems willing to guarantee
some £3O million, backed by private insurance, provided
Indonesia will honestly discuss eventual compensation for
nationalised Dutch holdings.
Nationalisation still hangs over British businesses. The
hopeful Dutch attitude might also be wrecked by the erratic,
blow-hot-blow-cold nature of Indonesian economic policy.
Exports Up, but the Usual
Wipeout from Invisibles
XTo one will deny that 1963-64 has been a wonderful export
year for Australia, with boom prices for meat, sugar,
strong prices for wool (at least to March) and remarkable
windfall sales of wheat. Yet, at the end of 11 months, the
excess of exports over imports is only £193.7 million and
invisible items such as freight, insurance, etc. will more than
offset this surplus. So, after all the fuss, Australia should
end 1963-64 with a net deficit on current trading account.
There was a net deficit of £125 million for invisibles in the
six months to December compared with £256 million for the
year to June, 1963. This suggests a repeat of the 1962-63
figure of invisibles, thus wiping out the trading surplus.
Australia's increase in international reserves, therefore, has
come from capital investment, overseas borrowings and un-
distributed profits of overseas interests.
Japanese Steel Industry
No. 3 in World
Tapan has become the world’s third-biggest steel producer,
** having displaced West Germany from that position. The
two leaders are USA and Russia.
The growing place of steel in the Japanese economy lends
particular point to the voracious demand for coal, as expressed
throughout The Bulletin’s Coal Supplement on pages 39-46
of this issue.
Another survey mission now in Australia also emphasises
Japan's reliance on overseas iron ore. Both of these crucial
raw materials need to be extensively sought from a great
variety of outside countries.
Actual production of crude steel by Japan reached
34,080,000 tons in the financial year ended March 31. A
remarkable 50 p.c. increase in the output of special steel
brought that figure up to 2,460,000 tons.
The Japan Iron and Steel Federation believes special steel
production should move above 4,000,000 tons in 1970, when
the Government's current income-doubling plan is due for
completion.
Not unlike the present Australian situation, much of
Japan's steel-making buoyancy can be ascribed to a vigorously
expansive motor vehicle industry. Other world producers will
not need to be reminded that Japan has enjoyed healthy and
highly competitive exports.

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Theory of Inflation
Professor Hagger’s views discussed
Tn bringing out Dr A. J. Hagger’s “The
Theory of Inflation” on the morrow
of the increase in the basic wage, the
Melbourne University Press could con-
ceivably be credited with a sardonic
sense of timing. For in 1951, the year
following the last occasion when the
basic wage was increased by £l, retail
prices in Australia rose by 24.2 p.c.
However, Dr Hagger, who is a Reader
in Economics at the University of Tas-
mania, is not speaking to the madding
crowd in Australia who may be fearful
that the Arbitration Commission has
embarked them on a dangerous excur-
sion so much as to academics in a wider
audience familiar with the literature on
the theory of inflation. Others may well
dip into this book without reaping any
clear rewards at all, especially those
with weak stomachs for algebra.
To do full justice to Hagger’s brilliant
analysis, whose field is not so much to
outline his or anybody else’s theory of
inflation as to pinpoint the gaps in the
general body of theory, and to suggest
lines for its future development, one
cannot also easily project it for general
appreciation. In plucking useful threads
for the public consumption from this
complicated weave, the merit of its
simultaneous equations must be left aside
for judgment by his fellows in the
stratosphere of higher mathematical
economics.
One doesn't know of any toilers in
this field having ever sat on the Arbitra-
tion Commission’s bench, but at least
present members of the bench have
shown themselves aware in their recent
written judgments of the importance of
“wages drift”, one of the elements in
inflation which looks to be the most
intractable to have raised its head on
the Australian scene, and one the Com-
mission curiously declared itself help-
less to allow for in its latest decision.
ITagger has a pretty good look at this
wolf, wages drift. The pity is that in
the general viewpoint he gives only the
quickest glimpse of the creature in
simpler clothing before proceeding on
an algebraic foray into current theory
on the concept. However, this is
sufficient to indicate that wages drift is
a complicated even if definite thorn in
the side of wage fixers. It emerges that
three definitions are in use among
theoretical economists.
In looking at the various economic
theories analysing the part played by
wages drift in inflationary processes,
Hagger puts his finger on several deter-
minants but thinks that tw'o theorists,
Hansen and Rehn, are right in neglecting
some as being of secondary importance
and concentrating attention on two main
causes w'hich are very familiar to us in
this country.
These are, first, changes in the level
of earnings of time-workers resulting
from a divergence between the rates
actually paid and those prescribed in the
relative collective agreements (including
Australian Arbitration Commission
awards) which form the basis for the
wage rate index used to measure the
changes in the level of negotiated wage
rates.
The other is changes in the level of
earnings of piece-workers resulting from
changes in labor productivity.
T>ut in justifying a third cause
changes in the extent of overtime
working—as being of secondary impor-
tance, one must strongly contest that
Hagger is right apropos the situation in
Australia. Moreover, a recent correspon-
dent of The Bulletin, Mr John Patter-
son, w'ho has been Mr R. J. Hawke's
shadow at the basic wage hearings this
year, also appears to have underrated
its importance in criticising what he calls
The Bulletin’s “partisan line” on the
wage cases. Mr Patterson made this
statement: “It is wage rates, or the
amount paid for an hour’s work, which
are matched with productivity.”
This is pure fiction in conditions
reigning now in Australia. A simple
example is sufficient to demonstrate this.
Take an employee who works on normal
award rates within standard hours and
is paid one and a half times normal
award rates for, say, one hour after
normal hours. Does the employee’s pro-
ductivity suddenly become one and a
half times greater than normal as soon
as overtime begins?
That in effect is what Mr Patterson is
implying. No, we are not being con-
fused, as he stated, about “the difference
between working longer hours and re-
ceiving more pay at fixed hourly rates,
and working the same hours and getting
more pay from higher rates.” The con-
fusion is in Mr Patterson’s mind. .
Indeed, in current conditions of acute
labor shortages, underlined more strongly
than ever by the May unemployment
figures, it is clear that wages drift caused
through the proliferation of overtime
working in industry -is now a more
critical factor than Hagger’s analysis
would seem to suggest in the prospect
for the development of inflationary
pressure.
Moreover, both overtime working and
the two other factors seen by Hagger as
the main determinants of wages drift
work not only through the process of
cost inflation but also through the
creation of excessive spending power in
the economy.
Incidentally, Hagger gives an admir-
■*" able summary of the various types of
inflation and examines these at some
length, quoting Bowen “ ... It is no
longer fashionable to speak simply of
‘inflation’; instead one must specify
whether he means ‘cost inflation’,
‘demand inflation’, ‘excess-demand in-
flation’, ‘wage inflation’, ‘money in-
flation’, ‘structural inflation’, ‘log-rolling
inflation’, ‘buyers’ inflation’, ‘sellers’ in-
flation’, ‘mark-up inflation’, ‘administer-
ed-price inflation’, and so on.”
Anybody who is confused by all these
names will find Hagger a good guide,
particularly on the general distinction
between cost and demand inflation.
As to the general importance of
excessive demand for labor in the pro-
cesses of wages determination and, by
that route, of inflation, Hagger finds this
one of the big unsettled issues in the
theory on the subject.
He says there is a sharp division of
opinion among writers. Some like
Lydall and Turner believe all the
essential features of the behavior of
average wage-earnings under inflationary
conditions can be accounted for without
reference to the extent of the excess
demand for labor. Others, like Hansen
and Rehn. believe excess demand plays
a critical role both at the collective
bargaining and workshop levels.
As to the nature, rather than the
importance, of the role played by excess
demand for labor, some writers—Kaldor
and W. G. Bowen, for instance—argue
that the state of profits, not the level of
excess demand for labor, is the key
determinant of movements in average
wage - earnings, and that any close
association between excess demand and
movements in money wages will, to a
large extent, merely reflect a high
correlation between the level of excess
demand and the level of profits.


“CROESUS”
Savings —The Key to Stability
A ticklish task for Mr Holt
week the “Investors’ Chronicle”
(London) publishes a chart plotting
the movements of ordinary share prices
and the yield on old consols for the
last 20 years, with arrows pointing to
particular stretches of the graph covered
by the ruling monetary trend or event,
such as devaluation, inflation, dear
money, big bank rate changes and so
on.
In this 20-year period inflation occurs
three times, and in each case it is named
after the reigning Chancellor of the
Exchequer, two for Labor—Dalton’s
spanning 1946-47 and Gaitskell’s in
1949-51—and one for the Conservatives
• —Butler's in 1955.
In the journal’s calculations little in-
flations don t count, though Selwyn
Lloyd must have barely escaped an attri-
bution for 1960-61 and Maudling for
1963-64. Presumably an inflation must
be a galloping one to qualify.
If we ran a similar graph for Aus-
tralia covering the same 20 years, Labor
and LCP Treasurers would have one
each—Chifley’s spanning 1948 and 1949
when the “C” series index of retail
prices for the six capital cities rose by
23 per cent, and Fadden's inclusive of
1950, 1951 and 1952 when the price
rise was 55 p.c.
Fadden would also have one “little”
inflation, in 1957, when prices put on
6 p.c. and Holt also, in that in the three
years ending 1961 the consumer price
index added 7 p.c.
VSfiTH every Treasurer in his time
straining to avert inflation and so
many extraneous factors contributing to
inflationary pressure, it may be a bit
hard to nail particular Treasurers as
owning inflations.
True, it is up to the Treasurer to
institute anti-inflationary measures, but
when, as in 1960, Mr Holt shovelled his
anti-inflationary bricks on the economy
and certainly stopped prices running
away, he was pelted on all sides. So was
Sir Arthur Fadden in 1951, but by the
time he got round to his “horror” Budget
of 1951-52 inflation had already gal-
loped so fast that it had almost come to
a stop and the economy required a
different sort of treatment.
Though the present Treasurer can
look back over the last three years with
pride in the maintenance of price stabi-
lity, even he would admit that extraneous
factors have been working strongly in
his favor. The big question he has to
ponder now is whether they will con-
tinue to do so in conditions which
otherwise point to the need for excep-
tional measures on his part —a recon-
sideration of the whole of his expansion-
ist fiscal policy which has allowed the
economy to cut unemployment to hard-
core dimensions.
In his position one would at present
be looking not so much to the outwork-
ings of his financial policy, but to the
basic foundations on which that policy
is based to see what the chances are that
they will be preserved. This brings up
immediately the question of savings, or,
more particularly, to the propensity to
save.
is not only a fundamental element,
but the key one in considering
whether Mr Holt could follow Mr Chif-
ley and Sir Arthur Fadden with a place
on my imaginary graph as owning a
big inflation.
The decision whether to save or spend
is an individual one, and thus far in the
cycle which has taken us up from the
recessed level of income generation of
1961-62 to the present position where
incomes are at flood levels and are now
to get a gratuitous rise of something like
£lOO million a year from the basic wage
increase alone.
The mass of individual decisions have
not wavered from the cautious attitude
towards spending engendered by the un-
certainties of the recession.
It might have been expected that full
employment would weaken the propen-
sity to save. There were indications six
months ago that this might be happening,
but these have not been confirmed by
the subsequent savings figures.
According to the latest estimates of
national income and expenditure, per-
sonal savings in the first nine months of
1963-64 amounted to £642 million com-
pared with only £471 million in the same
period of 1962-63, an increase of 36.6
p.c. In the same nine months of 1961-
62 personal savings came to £406 mil-
lion.
For the March quarter this year the
total was £175 million, compared with
£122 million and £9B million in the two
previous March quarters.
Again, taking the combined figures for
savings bank deposits in March and
April for the last two years (rather than
the April figures because Easter fell in
March this year and in April last year)
this year shows a rise of £22 million as
against last years increase of £13.2
million.
For the four months since December,
savings bank deposits have ciimbed by
£60.5 million compared with only £42.9
million in the same period of 1963.
Even discounting the rise in incomes
this year, there is no evidence in these
comparisons of the saving motive weak-
ening.
True, there has been a substantial lift
in spending this year, and the latest
figures show expenditure on retail goods
in general to be rising at a more rapid
rate than last year.
The combined figures for March and
April for retail sales were 5.5 p.c. higher
than for the same two months last year,
which in turn were only 3.6 p.c. up on
March and April for the recession year,
1962.
On top of that, spending on new
motor vehicles in these two months this
year was running at 23 p.c. above that
of the same two months last year, com-
pared with the latter’s increase of about
17 p.c. over the like months of 1962.
The overall rise in consumption ex-
penditure is, perhaps, better seen in the
national income and expenditure sta-
tistics. These show an increase in
national personal consumption expen-
diture of just short of 6 p.c. in the first
nine months this year.
The Arbitration Commission has
thrown an additional £lOO million a year
into the incomes ring, which in any case
has been expanding at something like
8 p.c. in recent quarters. The big poser,
therefore, is whether this sort of increase
in disposable incomes will spark off an
increase in prices big enough to weaken
the propensity to save.
A ssuming for the moment that the
propensity to save is unchanged, the
effect on prices from the demand side
will be decided by the impact on the
stream of goods and services of that
part of their additional incomes which
the public decides to spend.
On the assumption that propensity to
save stays the same, this fraction will be
roughly as before, but, of course, in
terms of spending power it will be
greater roughly in proportion to the
increase in incomes.
The critical question for the economy
at the moment is whether the increase
in spending will be big enough to lift
prices sufficiently to cause the propensity
to save to weaken. If it does, then any
weakening will set off further price rises,
Which, in turn, would further weaken the
propensity to save and in the process
alter the prevailing pattern of prefer-
ences for liquidity and non-money assets.
This would, of course, aggravate the
inflation.

The Indian Wool Market
Transference from tops to raw, greasy wool is predicted
By P. KOFLER
many years India has been a
dominant market for Australian
wooltops. However, current develop-
ments in the local Indian textile industry
indicate that this market may eventually
disappear. It is contended that India will
transfer her purchases from tops to raw,
greasy wool.
The following table shows Australian
wooltop export trends to India:—
Table I - AUSTRALIAN WOOLTOP EXPORTS

June 30 India Exports Total
1960 3985 22,743 17.5

1964 9 months 2266 20,223 11.2
to March.

Statistics.
Current Indian wooltop purchases are
well below previous buying trends. This
situation is attributable largely to in-
creased imports from the United King-
dom. Indeed, from April to December,
1963, British tops exports represented
9.8 m. lb. Is the same declining pattern
prevalent in the raw wool sector? In-
formation is contained in Table 11.

Statistics.
The above data show substantial in-
creases in Indian raw, greasy wool pur-
chases.
With a total population exceeding 430
millions, India offers a vast wool market
potential. But this region can only be
approached from the long-term view-
point. Per capita wool consumption
approximates 0.4 lb., while average
cotton usage is 4.2 lb. Indeed, total fibre
consumption does not exceed 5.0 lb. per
head. The principal factors determining
Indian wool usage are: (1) Low personal
incomes; (2) Unsuitable climatic con-
ditions; (3) Wool import restrictions;
(4) Synthetic fibre advances.
During 1960-61 the annual average
Indian personal income was £A3I.
According to the third Indian economic
plan this is expected to reach £A36 by
1965-66. The populace simply does not
possess the money to purchase wool
clothing.
In 1965-66 the population will
approach 500 million people. It is
doubtful whether personal incomes can
exceed this growth rate, let alone equal
it, particularly in view of past economic
results.
Climate is an important determinant
of Indian wool demand. The northern
provinces present the greatest, market
potential. There the winters are bitterly
cold. Unfortunately, the major propor-
tion of the Indian populace is located in
the southern areas.
Sample surveys reveal that highest
wool clothing expenditure occurs in the
north-west and the lowest in the south.
More consumption patterns are given in
Table III:

All fibres - 6.90 6.50 6.11 6.19
These figures do not include man-made fibres.

A salient feature of the above data is
the higher consumption rates in cities
compared with other areas. It follows,
therefore, that the rural/urban popula-
tion ratio has a distinct influence on
wool consumption.
Available information indicates a -drift
from the rural sectors, although about
80 per cent of the population is still
located in rural regions. Other things
being equal, as this trend continues so
the demand for wool clothing must rise.
It appears difficult to comprehend that
India is both an exporter and importer
of raw, greasy wool, but that is precisely
the paradoxical situation. Indian wool
production trends for the past six years
are presented in Table IV: —

Production has been static. Most wool
output is of the carpet type, being coarse,
springy fibres totally unsuitable for use
in apparel. The overall effect is that
India has to import her apparel wool
either in the raw, scoured or tops.
The situation becomes more acute
when one realises the perennial Indian
balance of payments problems. Wool
consumption has been adversely affected
by frequent imposition of wool import
restrictions. This is a problem which
Australia can overcome with long-term
credit, particularly in view of the recent
establishment of long-term credit facili-
ties.
At the present time trained Austra-
lian personnel are ' assisting the wool
industry by teaching the indigenous
people wool classing methods. Trade
reports have revealed that a higher pro-
portion of locally produced wools could
be used in apparel manufacturing, if
correctly classed.
The tremendous growth of the Indian
man-made fibre cannot be ignored. Pro-
duction increased from 25 m. lb. in 1957
to 61 m. lb. in 1962, representing 62 p.c.
of total requirements. Government
national plans aim to further enhance
the significance of this sector.
Not only does the industry create
more employment opportunities, but it
also attracts foreign capital, augments
technological developments and reduces
synthetic fibre imports. Efforts are being
made to obtain locally the synthetic fibre
industry raw material requirements.
What of the Indian wool textile in-
dustry itself? The sector is composed of
many diverse segments. The large spin-
ning and weaving mills dominate the
industry, although a fair proportion of
wool is utilised in villages where spinners
and weavers work in their homes or at
communal centres in small towns.
In view of past Chinese border threats,
local industry production has been geared
for defence purposes.
Table V summarises the current con-
dition of the Indian wool textile industry.

Actual plant utilisation has averaged
little more than H shifts a day. The
industry is in need of modernisation,
trained personnel and greater machine
utilisation. The International Wool
Secretariat has already sent trained
technicians to assist the industry.
There is little doubt that if India is
to become a large Australian wool mar-
ket the indigenous people will have to be
taught how to help themselves.

Big Money in Beer
WA and SA breweries reveal record profits
fThiE remarkable performance by the
Swan Brewery during the current
decade moved to new heights in the latest
year to March 31. There is obviously a
strong connection between the expansion
of its home State, WA, and the growth
of the company’s financial stature.
With four breweries, in Perth, Kal-
goorlie, Darwin and Stuart (not all in
WA, of course) and a chain of hotels,
the company cannot help but progress
further as WA pushes on, expanding in-
dustry and population.
The latest accounts from the group
must establish the company as one of the
most successful in Australia, so share-
holders have every reason to toast their
good fortune by cracking another can
of that famous Swan Lager.
Profit of £794,000 was, of course, a
record. It equalled 19.2 p.c. on ordinary
capital, the best percentage since 1949-
50. It compares with 12.3 in 1960,
14.1 in 1961, 15.2 in 1962 and 17.5 last
year. The dividend has been held at last
year’s higher 15 p.c. rate. Dividend in
1960 was 10 p.c.
In the same year reserves of £3.8
million exceeded paid capital of £3.5
million. At March 31 last, both these
figures had grown to £4.2 million to give
shareholders a colossal £8.4 million
equity in all the assets of the group
which total £lO million.
This decade has also seen big gains
for shareholders on the market itself.
In the calendar year 1959 the scrip sold
between 10s. and 15s. but current prices
are approaching 30s. Combining this
factor with the one-for-seven bonus
made in 1961-62, it would be safe to
say that those who have held an interest
since 1959 have at least doubled their
money.
Even an investment at current prices
would probably double its value by the
end of the ’sixties. If WA’s growth
does slow down during this time, the
company’s vigorous export policy (46
countries at present) will undoubtedly
help to maintain performance. But as
exports are continually increasing and
expansion in WA is more likely to see
an up-tempo in the next five or six
years, Swan’s outlook is decidedly
cheery.
The South Australian Brewery Co.
also has a future with plenty of promise.
Its results for the year to February 29
were released last week. Profit rose
from £534,000 to a record of £601,000.
This is equal to 12.5 p.c. on capital and
gives a better cover than last year’s 11.1
p.c. for the steady 10 p.c. dividend.
Breweries and several hotels are run
throughout the State, where the com-
pany is the sole manufacturer and dis-
tributor of draught beer.
Like Swan, the shareholders have a
gigantic equity in their company—£B.4
million out of total assets of £10.4 mil-
lion. Of this equity, £4.8 million com-
prises paid capital.

MARKET POINTERS
Solid Old ICIANZ
A lift in earning rate by chemical
giant ICIANZ Ltd from 12.2 p.c.
to 13.2 p.c. for the six months to March
is not as spectacular as the 22.1 p.c.
increase in group profit, and it all goes
to show that shareholders should not be
dazzled by big leaps in profit.
The larger average ordinary capital
was the deciding factor.
Nonetheless, a higher earning rate
from ICIANZ should bring joy to share-
holders because it wasn’t so long ago
that the chemical boys were complaining
about unfair import competition.
Since then there has been some tariff
adjustment and last year’s full dividend
of 7 i p.c. looks in no danger if the
group maintains a 13.2 p.c. earning rate.
In fact, there will be hopes of some lift
in dividend.
Buyers of the 20s. shares at around
535. obtain a yield of only 2.7 p.c., but
also are buying conservatively stated
assets of 575. a share. The market price
reached 595. 6d. earlier this year and,
with current figures providing some hope
for a dividend increase, there is no doubt
that investors who like heavyweights in
the ICIANZ class will be prepared to
buy a few shares to lock away. Unspec-
tacular maybe, but solid definitely.
YS/ouldn’t it be nice to own some
ordinary shares in Goodyear Tyre
and Rubber Co. ( Aust .), whose earning
rate was 96 p.c. for the year to Decem-
ber?
At the same time, it would be a bit
of a shock to see ordinary dividend cut
from 85 p.c. to 40 p.c., which is what
happened this year when the Goodyear
parent of Akron , USA, paid itself a
dividend on the £l.7m. ordinary capital.
The motor boom certainly has helped
the tyre manufacturers, but it wasn’t too
many years ago that tyre selling was ex-
tremely competitive. It still is, but the
market has expanded considerably.
Even if motor registrations taper off,
as many people anticipate, a strong mar-
ket is available. But the manufacturers
have geared production to current de-
mand and would not welcome any back-
slide.
Dunlop, at round 535. to yield 3.5
p.c., should continue to do well, but
buyers of the shares would be looking
for that extra benefit. Unless you can
pick the right time to anticipate such a
benefit, there appears to be more scope
in some of the up-and-coming companies
in other fields.
★ ★ ★
VS/hat other companies, for example?
The fertiliser companies, despite
their inflated share market values, appear
to have big prospects ahead with buoyant
farm incomes permitting extensive pur-
chases of fertiliser.
★ ★ ★
VI/’ith tin prices so buoyant, and fore-
casts of a continued shortage,
supporters of Aberfoyle Tin at 14s. 6 d.
say there is something left in them yet.

"VTewcomers like A. J. Dawson, the
automotive engineer of Sydney,
could continue to gain support at 14s.
as it becomes better known.

A ND ’ if you are looking for rights
issues, the very pricy James Hardie
Asbestos rights, preferably below £5 10s.
(with 20s. to pay on the new shares),
may prove a long term winner. There
could be more rights on the market when
entitlements are issued later this month.
It takes courage to step in at these
prices, but the company’s expansion pro-
gramme, combined with internal strength
and an undoubtedly high (if conserva -
tively stated) earning rate says a lot in
its favor.
Jetting back to the old uncle of the
South Seas—Burns, Philp—the gilt-
edged supporters say that the regularity
of recent bonuses suggests another five-
year “putaway”, with a lashing of Burns,
Philp (South Sea) for good measure.
Also, they see no reason to neglect
W. R. Carpenter, even at today’s high
prices, because this company already
controls 142,000 shares in Burns, Philp,
apart from its other profitable interests.

T. & A. Gilbert, the Holden dealer,
” came out with a nice result. The
market has kept the ss. shares at a high
level, but recent prices of around 17s. do
not look so bad for a company with such
a high earning rate. Only trouble is the
fear of an increase in vehicle sales tax
in the next Budget.


INVESTMENT SECTION
Wages and the Share Market
Another crack at motor industry?
A Melbourne stockbroking firm
moved very smartly to express its
opinions on the basic wage increase
which was announced on June 9. By
June 11 the clients had in their hands
a circular which indicated what effect
the 20s. increase would have on the
performance of the various groups of
listed companies on ’Change.
Although the argument was rather
broad and generalised, in that it did not
name any particular companies, what
was put forward should be valuable as
an overall guide to the share market in
consequence of the economy's increased
spending power.
After the new wage has been extended
to State as well as Federal awards and
to all unions, the broker estimates that
the national wage bill will rise by about
£l6O million a year. On top of full em-
ployment this will have inflationary ten-
dencies. But the broker emphasises that
there are two types of inflation—“cost”
inflation and “demand” inflation.
The Government has already em-
ployed certain deflationary measures in
an effort to contain the latter by using
such weapons as transfers to Statutory
Reserve Deposits and increasing bond
rates. The broker feels that further
action may be taken along these lines to
help combat the latest threat.
However, according to the broker, the
Government can do little to prevent the
onset of further “cost” inflation. There-
fore, the wage increase will have a two-
fold effect. Those companies which can
pass on the increased wages bill should
do better (presumably because of any
increased demand which eventuates).
This group, the broker says, includes all
services, such as retailers, and those
manufacturers not in competition with
imports.
On the other hand, those who cannot
pass on the increase may be caught in a
squeeze—between a ceiling on selling
prices fixed by import competition and
an increase in their own costs as a result
of the wage rise. This group includes
local manufacturers who sell in direct
competition with imports.
The position of this group will not be
improved by the fact that few import
controls are in existence at present. If
demand rises above local supply, the
excess can readily be obtained from
overseas. This would be detrimental
mainly to manufactured goods, but bene-
ficial to the economy as a whole in the
sense that imports will act as a “safety
valve” for excessive demand.
The broker goes on to warn against
investment in the automotive industry.
It says the Government is concerned with
its “tremendous boom”, shown by record
sales and production. There has already
been talk about further tariff restrictions
on “all-imported” cars and there are aims
for locally produced and assembled
vehicles to have a 95 p.c. Australian
content within five years. For these
reasons, the industry may be singled out
for further attention by August’s Budget
in an effort to reduce the present boom.
The broker would not be surprised if
sales tax on cars “received attention”,
as this measure has often been used in
the past to control the motor industry.
In summary, it is suggested that
shorter-term investment be directed out
of those companies which are already
in severe competition with imports and
those engaged in automobile distribution.
Selective share investment in services,
and chose companies not in competition
with imports, looks sound as a hedge
against forthcoming “cost inflation”.
Feather in the ICIANZ Cap
HpnERE is no stopping the dynamic
ICIANZ organisation. Over the
months of 1964 the group has an-
nounced several big expansion pro-
grammes and at present subscriptions are
being collected for Australia’s biggest
ever unsecured note issue.
The latest feather in the ICIANZ cap
was last week’s announcement of a big
profit lift from £1,906,000 to £2,328,000
during the six months to March 31.
Last year's full result came out at
£3,649,000 and this will certainly be
topped in another year of incredible
growth.
However, the more important earning
rate will not show such big increases. In
the first place paid capital will be higher
this year. The £1,906,000 earnings in
the first half of last year equalled 6.1
p.c. on the average ordinary figure of
£30.6 million. The big increase to
£2,328,000 in the first half of 1963-64
is only reflected by an earnings move to
6.6 p.c. on higher average capital of
£34.7 million.
By the time the books are ruled off
on September 30 the group will have to
take account of substantially higher in-
terest charges from recent borrowings
before calculating profits. As these
charges will be higher than in the March
half, the profit earnings increase in this
second half may not be as big as the
present results indicate.
All these figures back up the opinion
expressed in “Security Analysis” in
The Bulletin of June 13 that the
possibility of a dividend increase this
year is doubtful and that, at current
prices, the scrip is for the long-term in-
stitutional investor. It will be some time
before all the current expansion is fully
reflected in the company’s earning rate.
The 64-Dollar Question
IV/Jelbourne-based general grocery
and produce merchant Permewan
Wright really produced something out
of the box when its results for the year
to March 31 were announced last week.
Investors were expecting a sizeable pro-
fit lift anyway, but nothing like the
jump which was revealed from
£273,481 to £374,767.
In a preliminary statement released in
May, directors had indicated that the
result would be a record and said that the
percentage of net profit had been “fully
maintained” on turnover which had
risen from £lB million to £2l million.
Thus the warning was out, but few could
have realised just how lucrative opera-
tions had been.
The 64-dollar question now is: Will
the dividend be increased? Most tipsters
and market observers say yes. Last
year the payout was 123 p.c., comprising
a 5 p.c. interim and a 73 p.c. final. Earn-
ings equalled 19.3 p.c. on capital.
This latest result gives a wider cover
with earnings of 22.7 p.c. An interim
payout of 5 p.c. has already been dis-
tributed but, at the time of going to
press, there has been no announcement
as to the size of the final payout. The
fact that this was not given with the
profit results possibly indicates that the
board is at least considering the matter.
“Buy Ozapaper”
rpHE “buy Ozapaper” tip suggested by
-*■ The Bulletin (p. 59) last week
came good earlier than anticipated. The
day before the issue hit the street, the
directors announced that a share issue
would be made sometime this year.
The size will depend on the outcome
of the takeover bid for Sydney’s Max
Wurcker (Holdings) Ltd. Originally
there was competition from a UK paper
maker, William Nash Ltd, but for an
unexplained reason this firm decided not
to proceed. So Ozapaper is now await-
ing acceptance to its nine-for-five share
bid.

31. Earning rate is a modest 4.4 p.c.

The Parking Investment Fad
VTew indoor bowling company floats
■ were all the rage among investors a
couple of years ago. The latest fad
seems to be city car parks. When a
Melbourne daily recently reported that
Australian Parking Ltd would join the
public list, the handling broker, Frank
G. Irving & Co., received preliminary
requests for shares exceeding 300,000.
This was rather remarkable in that the
company has nowhere near as good a
history, or predicted future, as such
recently listed companies as A. V. Wehl
or Colin Martyn. The colossal response
to these listings, did not really come until
after the prospectus was issued.
Last year, City Parking Pty Ltd,
which operates the park, earned only
11.8 p.c. on the proposed paid capital
of £175,000. There was some improve-
ment in the latest December half-year,
however, when results, on an annual
basis, equalled 14.1 p.c. Dividends of
10 p.c. are expected.
City Parking was half-owned by Pro-
ject Development of Sydney, the rest
being in the hands of smaller Melbourne
interests. These tw'o groups are selling
half each of the 300,000 ss. shares.
Australian Parking now owns all the
shares in the operating company, and it
is gaining public status through a place-
ment which, to make matters less en-
couraging, is subject to a premium of
Is. Bd. plus brokerage and stamp duty.
To warrant the investors’ response,
earnings will have to go much higher
than the current 14 or 15 p.c. Although
the park has one of the best positions in
the city, on the corner of Bourke and
Hardware Streets, only two minutes’
walk from Myers’ in the shopping hub
of Melbourne, and just as close to the
Little Collins Street business centre, earn-
ings will be limited somewhat until ex-
pansion elsewhere is executed.
On this point the chairman, Mr A. H.
G. Clarke, has said that group policy
will be to expand parking operations in
other directions. But this will take time
and study if expansion is to be successful.
Jas. Hardie’s Caution
/Chairman of James Hardie Asbestos
Ltd (Mr A. Thyne Reid) says pro-
fits in the year to March 31 showed a
substantial increase over 1962-63 (about
32 p.c.) but it would be imprudent to
expect this rate of growth to continue.
A high volume of sales (the actual
turnover is not given in the annual
report), plus increased manufacturing
efficiency as a result of past capital ex-

FCA Goes to Malaysia
A ustralia is becoming too small for
some of the finance companies. Fol-
lowing last year’s lead by Australian
Guarantee Corporation Ltd, the South
Australian-based Finance Corporation of
Australia Ltd is moving into Malaysia.
It will subscribe 45 p.c. of the initial
paid capital of one million Malaysian
dollars in a new company, Malaysian
Australian Finance Co. Ltd. The other
subscribers are Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking (30 p.c.) and Malaysian in-
vestors (25 p.c.).
FCA’s initial investment in the com-
pany will be about £67,500.
The company will operate along the
lines of FCA, lending money on real
estate, leasing industrial plant and equip-
ment. discounting mortgages and com-
mercial paper, and providing hire-pur-
chase facilities.
FCA is well entrenched in South
Australia, and is 40 p.c. owned by the
Bank of Adelaide.
CSR’s Confident Predictions
Tn attempting to answer shareholders’
A natural enquiry as to whether the
large profit increase for 1963-64 was
“abnormal”, the directors of The
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd pre-
dicted that 1964-65 results would be
approximately the same as last year.
They could see no basic weakness in
the market price, as there was no dan-
ger of world over-supply in 1964. And
the present world price of £stg46 for a
large proportion of exports was satis-
factory to millers as a component of the
overall market for home consumption
and export sugar, especially when the
crop and tonnage of raw sugar were
large.
Directors expect a 17 p.c. increase in
the output of CSR sugar mills this year.
Their estimate is 765,000 tons, or
113,000 tons more than the record
achieved in the 1963 season, with further
increases planned for 1964 and 1965.
Improvement in profits of the building
materials activities is continuing, and
sales of industrial chemicals are still
buoyant, although pressure on prices
persists.

Profit From CRA Brick Co.?
is every chance that 1964 will
be the first year in which Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia will see the benefits
of the trading results turned in by Rio
Tinto Brick Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned
subsidiary. In the current year it will
be producing bricks for a full 12 months
for the first time.
The company was originally created
by Rio Tinto Mining Co. of Australia,
before its merger with Consolidated Zinc
Corp. into CRA. Site preparation for
the £2 million plant at Campbellfield,
near Melbourne, started in August,
1961, after 15 months of intensive study
in Australia and overseas. Early in
1962 work began on the tunnel kiln
plant which was to have an annual
capacity of 25 million bricks.
Production on the 120-acre site
started as early as July last year, but
commercial production did not come
until November. The annual report for
the 1963 year, recently released, said
operations were now close to full
capacity. Eventually there are plans to
install a second tunnel kiln to double the
annual production to 50 million bricks.
According to the report, the clay
deposits on hand are sufficient to ensure
this production rate for more than 50
years.
The product is described as a “high
quality face brick”. It comes in a wide
variety of colors and textures. To date,
they have met with an excellent market
response, and demand has exceeded
original expectations. This backs up the
statement made last July by Sir Maurice
Mawby, CRA chairman, that a demand
would exist for all the 25 million annual
output.
The annual report shows that 1963
showed a loss of £193,000 —in line with
directors’ expectations. The chances of
a sizeable profit this year are high as
they expect the “encouraging demand”
so far to continue through the rest of
the year.
Just as important, however, is the fact
that tax will not be taking much of a
toll because of losses to date. Moreover,
the company was formerly engaged in
mining exploration projects as Rio Tinto
Southern Pty Ltd and, under this name,
losses of £909,000 were recorded.
At balance date, December 31 last,
issued capital was £2.1 million but, after
allowing for accumulated losses, share-
holders’ funds were only £996,787.
Total assets were £1,788,302 and total
liabilities £791,515. Of these two figures,
current' assets and current liabilities took
£120,560 and £311,515 respectively.
Larke’s Japanese Concession
F arke Consolidated Industries Ltd
of Sydney is contracting for the
Australian supply and manufacture of
vehicles produced by Prince Motors Ltd
of Japan.
It will first import the vehicles, and
later, when sales justify it, build them
up from completely knocked down
parts with an increasing Australian con-
tent.
Larke does not propose to distribute
the vehicles itself, but will appoint in-
dependent distributors in each State.
Prince vehicles were very successful in
the Japanese Grand Prix held last month
in Tokyo.
K. Harris Absorbs Tom-A-Tol
Tn a deal worth in market terms
£176,375, Keith Harris and Co. Ltd,
Sydney essence maker, acquired • the
Tom-A-Tol group of proprietary com-
panies.
Consideration was the issue of 85,000
ss. shares bringing paid capital to
£311,375, including £15,000 in prefer-
ence shares.
Tom-A-Tol, a Sydney company, pro-
duces seasonings, flavoring essences, food
additives and allied chemical products
complementary to the Harris range of
products.
Softwood Settles with Kauri
HPhe best feature of Softwood Holdings’
report for the nine months to March
31 was not that profit had exceeded
budget estimates but that the £900.000
debt still owing to Kauri, following last
year's purchase of that company’s Mt
Gambier operations, is to be paid off by
June 30. This is much more indicative
of the group’s success.
Under the original contract of sale,
the debt had to be settled, through a
series of payments, by the end of 1969.
This means that settlement will be made
four and a half years before the due
date.
To be able to do this, the Adelaide-
based pine plantation owner, timber
miller and processor, must be making
profits considerably in excess of its divi-
dend needs, although it is more likely
that its excellent trading position has
enabled borrowing on very favorable
terms. Of course, some of the bill will
undoubtedly be met with a portion, if
not all, of the proceeds from the recent
premium placement of 100,000 shares
and a one-for-three shareholders’ par
issue. Together they will raise around
£320,000.
An increased earning rate seems in-
evitable this year. The fact that profits
are above budget augurs well but, more-
over, the six Kauri subsidiaries will be
operating for a full year under their new
owner for the first time. And their con-
tribution will be nothing to be sneezed
at. Although they were only purchased
in May last year, they were already inte-
grated by November after making a
small contribution to the 1962-63 result.
Profit in that year jumped by £37,000
to a record £124,000. This equalled
27.1 p.c. on capital from which 10 p.c.
went out as ordinary dividend. This
year's interim was 5 p.c.
Although 1963-64 earnings will pro-
bably cover the same payout even more
heavily, the prospects of an increase are
diminished by the fact that an issue has
already been made and by the burden
which must be borne in eliminating the
Kauri debt. Once cleared of these, the
prospect for a lucrative 1964-65 year is
virtually unlimited and shareholders are
sure to see further gains coming their
way.
Investors should not forget the bene-
fits which Kauri will get from early re-
payment. At a time when the company
is regaining its feet after extensive recon-
struction, an extra £900,000 in the bank
will prove to be a real shot in the arm.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A Market of Many Rises
Don’t let the share index sway you
are still a lot of people who feel
A that the whole market is dead. Per-
haps they have been hypnotised by a
very steady share index. But behind this
index is the story of many individual
share rises.
Naturally I’m most interested in the
shares in my own portfolio. This week
Conquip put on 9d. to 10s., F. W.
Williams new shares rose 2s. 3d. to
345., and James Hardie is now equiva-
lent to 1655.
However, the group of shares rising
most strongly is tin. The increase in the
world tin price to £stgl2so again has
not been accompanied by the flurry
experienced earlier in 1964.
It is, in fact, a more dramatic move-
ment. There no longer exists the
question of the proposed plan for the
disposal of the stockpile of tin by the
US Government. With a jump of over
£lOO in less than a week, there’s bound
to be a reaction. Nevertheless, the out-
look appears extremely promising.
I’m already in Tableland Tin at
365. 6d. The price of this share has
been a little slow to react, probably
because the dredge is being overhauled.
While that will affect this month’s pro-
duction, it doesn't alter the chairman’s
prediction that 3000 tons of tin should
be recovered in the next three years.
Based on the world price (then a little
under £900) this would give an after-
tax profit of £571,000. If, instead, you
worked on an average price of £llOO,
this would bring the profit up to
£1,000,000.
To increase my interest in tin, I
bought 500 Western Titanium. You
might argue that Western Titanium is
primarily an ilmenite producer and you
would be so right. However, it does
have a 20 p.c. interest in the Aberfoyle
Tin Development Partnership (Green-
bushes). Furthermore, it plans to
reserve for shareholders a major portion
of its one-fifth share of the capital of
this new company.
Currently, Western Titanium is doing
well from its ilmenite production. An-
ticipating the increased world demand
from pigment producers, the company
has concentrated on increasing pro-
ductive capacity. As a result, production
of ilmenite is expected to rise from
105,000 tons last year to 135,000 tons
this year.
So, carried away with tin, I almost
missed out on buying 2000 Pioneer Con-
Crete rights when they came back to
3s. 3d. After shorting them at 2s. 6d.
only a couple of weeks ago, this seems
like a complete change of face.
I must strongly defend this right of
flexibility. “If you can’t beat them, join
them,” holds true with most share
situations. The stiff l-for-4 issue at
7s. 6d. premium, payable in full, did
weaken the market fractionally after
my shorting. But forces were marshal-
ling and the share price was turned at
2s. 3d. From here they went to a peak
of 3s. 7d. This was such a steady but
firm rise that any reaction seemed a
good buying opportunity. Thus the
purchase at 3s. 3d.
As usual, I find less interest in selling
than buying. First of all was the sale
of 200 Pioneer Sugar at 70s. ex dividend,
giving a profit of £52. It’s been difficult
to keep up with this investment. Instead
of the bonus issue so widely expected,
directors decided to have a premium
issue. The market immediately dropped
from 70s. to 655., only to recover the
fall in the next few days. Big things are
still expected from this company so I'll
probably be back into it before the end
of the year.
The other sale, R. W. Miller, resulted
in a small loss of £l5. It proved to be
a share more suited to the patient
investor.
The week’s transactions were:
SOLD
200 Pioneer Sugar, 70/- £7lO
500 R. W. Miller, 18/8 £467
BOUGHT
2000 Pioneer Concrete rts, 3/3 £342
500 Western Titanium, 8/9 £225
The week's transactions temporarily
got the debit down to £B3. Then the
F. W. Williams’ application money
pushed that debit up to £686.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Woolworths and Its Great Rival
Long term investment just a toss up
VI/’oolworths and Coles are in the
same line of business and, looking
at their price graphs, there can be no
doubt that the prices over the last 18
months at least have moved in a remark-
ably similar fashion. However, Coles’
shares started from a lower base at the
beginning of the 1963 calendar year
(about 135.) and rose much higher (to
about 19s. 9d.).
The prices of both rose steadily to
mid-September, then declined until mid-
October to rise steadily again until the
second week in March, 1964, since when
they have both fallen again. These peaks
and bottoms occurred roughly as
follows:
Woolworths Coles
January, 1963 13/8 13/-
September, 1963 17/2 17/4 Theoretical
October, 1963 16/- 15/11 ex Rights
March, 1964 18/7 19/9 18/8
June, 1964 17/4 18/2 17/2
The higher price of Coles in March
and June, 1964, is due to the anticipation
and subsequent announcement of the
l-for-10 issue at 7s. 6d. It is, therefore,
preferable to look at the theoretical ex-
rights prices. But looking at these figures
one might get the impression that either
dividends or earnings per share were
identical. In fact, this is not the case
for during the period Woolworths was
paying a dividend of 7.2 d. per share
while Coles was paying a dividend of
6.6 d. per share.
During 1963 Woolworths’ earnings
per share amounted to 7.5 d. so far as the
market knew, while up to August the
market regarded Coles’ earnings as 9.1 d.
per share and after that date 10. Id.
Since February, 1964, Woolworths per
share earnings have been 8.9 d.
The table above could therefore be
shown in terms of dividend yield (after
making the adjustment for the Coles’
next issue) as in Table A herewith, or
in terms of earnings yield as in Table B.
TABLE A
Woolworths Coles
January, 1963 4.4 4.2
September, 1963 3.5 3.2
October. 1963 3.7 3.5
March, 1964 3.2 2.9
June, 1964 3.5 3.2
TABLE B
Wool worths Coles
January, 1963 4.7 7.0
September, 1963 3.7 5.8
October, 1963 4.0 6.3
March, 1964 4.0 5.4(a)
June, 1964 4.3 5.9 (a)
(a) Assuming that the earning rate can be
maintained on the new capital to be
issued next August.
Looking at these three tables one can
only get the impression that the prices
of the shares have been equal for most
of the period in absolute terms and,
referring back to the graphs, this has
been roughly the situation since April,
1963.
It may well be that this is the only
way to price the shares of these two
successful companies, for, as pointed out
here three months ago, it would seem
that if anything Coles has a somewhat
better record of shareholder benefits
than has Woolworths over the last seven
years.
However, over the last three years
Woolworths’ per share earnings have
increased at a slightly greater rate than
Coles despite the fact that Coles have
not made any major acquisitions during
this period while Woolworths have
acquired assets of the original Rock-
mans, Ashleys and Chic Salon clothing
chains of stores.
It may be helpful to look at net profit
before tax, depreciation and interest on
fixed loans as a percentage of sales over
this period and for this purpose Wool-
worths’ sales will be assumed to be
roughly £lOO million in 1961, £ll7
million in 1962 and £125 million in
1963.
Again it must be pointed out that the
two companies balance on different dates
and while “1963” means the year ended
on June 30, 1963, for Coles, it means
the year ended January 25, 1964, for
Woolworths.
Net profit before
tax % sales
Year 1961 1962 1963
Woolworths .... 4.4 4.8 5.6
Coles 5.8 7.1 7.6
In absolute terms, Coles seems to be
making more profit from each £1 of
sales, and also the rate of increase in
the profit per £1 seems to be slightly
greater than in the case of Woolworths.
But while Woolworths’ sales have in-
creased by 25 p.c., Coles’ sales have
increased by only 7 p.c.
It is unfortunate that we do not have
figures which include, so far as Wool-
worths is concerned, the sales and profits
of the “dress shops” for the whole period
so that a more appropriate comparison
could be made. In any event the figures
used for Woolworths’ sales can only be
regarded as approximate.
In the article on Coles of three
months ago, an incomplete series of the
ratio of net profit before tax, deprecia-
tion and interest on long-term debt as a
percentage of total capital employed was
shown. This series would appear as
follows now that we have the full
accounts for Woolworths’ “1963” year:
AVERAGE 1956-1958 = 100
Year Woolworths Coles
1959 102 72
1960 94 80
1961 80 74
1962 96 88
1963 106 89
From this series, one can gain the
impression that Woolworths’ return on
capital employed has been more stable
and it might also be mentioned that
Woolworths’ rate of return has been
increasing faster than Coles over the
last three years.
But despite all the pros and cons
few people would be disposed to select
one of these stocks in preference to the
other. It seems fairly clear that both
are ably managed and in the long term
their results have probably not differed
materially. Both are household words
in Australia; Coles better known in Vic-
toria and Woolworths better known in
NSW.
For the long-term portfolio where
short-term price movements are not im-
portant, equal holdings of each are
recommended.

Takeover in the Air
For Metro
VI/'hat company is negotiating with Melbourne’s Metropolitan
" Industries with the view to making a takeover bid?
More importantly, how much will it be worth if it eventu-
ates? These two questions were plaguing shareholders, inves-
tors, stockbrokers and finance journalists in Melbourne last
week. By the time this issue of The Bulletin reaches the
street, the answers will probably be at hand but, at the time
of going to press, all one can do is speculate on the matter.
The varying opinions on the value of the offer have been
indicated by the market price. The news had obviously
leaked in the first place, as Metro shares jumped Is. 9d. to
10s. 9d. on Friday, June 12, before the directors announced
that a bid was expected within seven days, and they had not
moved from this price when trading finished.
After brooding over the problem during the long weekend,
buyers decided to take the scrip up another 3s. 6d. to 14s. 3d.
on Tuesday, June 16. This brought an influx of profit takers
in on Wednesday, who cut the price back to 13s.—nearest
ever to the asset backing on each 5s. share of 12s. lOd. On
Thursday, the day before the bid was due, a recovery was
made to 13s. 9d. before a settling-back to 13s. 6d. Brokers
were advising clients not to sell at this level as there were
strong rumors circulating that the offer was worth 14s.
As to the identity of the bidder, Mayne Nickless was the
most strongly favored. Metro's refrigerated transport and
cold storage services could be integrated very profitably into
the Mayne Nickless transporting set-up.
How to Go Under
in Business
TVIR Norman Routley's copious experience as company
director and chartered accountant gave him plenty of
authority to talk to the Sydney division of the Australian
Institute of Management on business failures. Lie cast his net
wide, making it quite plain that bankruptcy is not the only
form of failure: “Not being successful is another form”.
Some company failures obviously lie beyond managerial
control. Mr Routley mentioned factors like the decline of
a traditional retailing area, the rigors of “too hot” competition
and changes in fashion for certain commodities.
But he was convinced that the main reason resided in one
blunt phrase: “managerial incompetence”. A fascinating sur-
vey by Dun and Bradstreet in America disclosed this principal
cause in about 44 p.c. of the sample examined. Lack of
experience and unbalanced experience produced a fair pro-
portion of failures as well.
The failure rate was highest among retail and construction
firms, and collapse came most often to enterprises under
five years old.
Mr Routley added a litany of 10 “important” reasons for
failure. They really provide a constant touchstone of business
backsliding. The catalogue comprises: Incomplete records,
poor knowledge of costs, lack of stock control, inadequate
sales policies, inadequate credit control, costs of manufacture
too high, failure to use budgets, inadequate use of plant,
poor financial management, and insufficient use of expert
advice.
Geneva Trade Conference
Debate Continues
HThe United Nations Trade and Development Conference has
A labored mightily at Geneva for three months to bring
forth another permanent appendage to the UN itself. On
the surface, nothing very much was done to change the eco-
nomic relations between developed and developing countries.
True to its rather detached status in the middle zone,
neither developing nor industrialised developed, Australia
refrained from voting on many plenary resolutions but played
an active part within the sectional committees. The Federal
Government expressed nominally liberal views on such ques-
tions as improved access, lowering of tariff and non-tariff
barriers, preferences and commodity agreements.
A gradual solution of those pressing matters still remains
to be tackled by the new UN body, the Trade and Develop-
ment Board, whose eventual decisions must then be approved
by the General Assembly. The Board will meet at least every
three years, though an executive committee can convene twice
a year.
Tremendous compromises were needed to get the Board
established. Yet the final acceptance of a “one nation, one
vote” principle could probably lead to much the same trouble
as frequently occurred at the main conference.
The richer nations, responsible as they are for about 80 p.c.
of world trade, not unnaturally refuse to bend before block
majority pressures from the under-developed, who, one com-
mentator advises, should learn the “art of possible achieve-
ment”.
It is not too hard to see what might happen on a 55-member
Board composed of 12 African countries, 10 Asian, 18 Western
European, US, Commonwealth and Japan combined, nine
Latin American and six Eastern European.
One valuable attitude which emerged from the conference
may, however, continue to exert a good effect. The old
East-West struggle apparently gave way to recognition of a
more fundamental trading division—that between the rich
industrial northern countries and the largely poorer southern.
While refusing to depart from the primacy of GATT and
its current efforts to liberalise trade through the Kennedy
Round (referred to elsewhere in this section), the developed
nations have been made to face the trade gap with the deve-
loping countries more clearly.
At Geneva, also, the finance committee did succeed in
attaining agreement on practicalities like capital flow and
suppliers’ credits. It was unrealistically optimistic to expect
quick and fair solutions on aid, commodity arrangements,
regional planning, for instance. Geneva guaranteed that the
debate can go on with somewhat more co-operative feeling.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Test Year for Mark Foys
Have all difficulties been overcome?
TVrectors of Mark Foys Ltd, Sydney
retailer, are still of the opinion that
their rehabilitation plans for the com-
pany will begin to show their full results
only in the year to February 28, 1965.
This was stated in the directors’ re-
port to shareholders on trading for
1963-64. Reading between the lines of
this report it is evident that directors
are very much aware of the chronic
nature of the company’s ills (based
primarily on the location of the main
Piazza store) and have no great hopes
for a return to the more buoyant condi-
tions of the ’fifties. (Record profit of
£163,867 was earned in 1954-55.)
Result of trading in the latest year to
February 28 was a profit of £53,376,
compared with the previous year’s
£60,996. No tax was payable for 1963-
64, although the provision in the year
before was £16,323. Depreciation was
reduced from £26,191 to £16,267.
The persistent decline in the business
area at the southern end of the city has
led the company to a policy of consolida-
tion and leasing of surplus space. The
furniture building was completely con-
verted and let at satisfactory rentals. The
fifth floor of the Piazza store was let as
office space, and the lower ground floor
was let as a restaurant in November,
1963.
The parking station has experienced a
decline in revenue over the past few
years (no doubt assisted by the erection
of the Council’s Goulburn Street park-
ing station) so that the Foy parking
building was let to a Car distribution firm,
while at the same time customer parking
facilities were maintained.
Sales of the Piazza store fell 5 p.c. in
1963-64. Fashion departments main-
tained their figures, but other depart-
ments, particularly home furnishings,
were unable to do so.
Losing trade in the city, Mark Foys
has endeavoured to compensate with
branch shops. These are located in
Double Bay, Rockdale, Eastwood,
Pymble and Northbridge (Sydney
suburbs) as well as King Street (city) and
Canberra.
All branch stores traded satisfactorily
in 1963-64. With them all operating for
a full year in 1964-65, plus the £lOO,OOO
receivable from rentals, directors expect
to be able to recommend a “substantial
restoration in the dividend rate”, given
reasonable trading conditions.
From that statement investors can take
it that the old 124 p.c. dividend rate will
not be restored in a hurry.
Reserves were used in 1962 and 1963
to keep up that rate, but in the year just
ended directors decided not to recom-
mend a dividend which would absorb
more than the profit. The 1963-64
earning rate of 6.8 p.c. allowed a divi-
dend of only 6+ p.c., including a 24 p.c.
final.
Sale of the Target Woollen Mills at
Rosebery for cash resulted in a
£170,000 capital profit. The company
had arranged a long-term loan on mort-
gage of the Piazza freehold but almost
half of this was temporarily suspended
when funds from the mill sale were in
hand.
The company has no liquidity pro-
blem. It has settled its faction fights, and
has been realistic about its surplus city
freeholds and constructive in its subur-
ban expansion. The current year will be
a real test of the company’s merchandi-
sing skills under ideal economic condi-
tions.
Investors who are prepared to pay
Bs. for the ss. shares (income yield
4.1 p.c.) must be confident that the
company’s difficulties are at an end.
(They are also paying tribute to the high
asset backing per share of 13s. 7d.)
As an investment Mark Foys shares
are strictly for income (there has been
no capital benefit of any kind for 45
years) and a 6 p.c. return would be a
reasonable expectation from such a stock.
A 10 p.c. dividend is required to
approach this return, and Mark Foys
could be straining to pay that rate in
1964-65.
GLEN IRIS BRICK HOLDINGS LTD
What of the Future?
Oince listing in November, 1961, the
history of Glen Iris Brick Holdings
Ltd has not been particularly encoura-
ging. Although the current buoyancy
in the building industry augurs well for
the company’s 1964-65 year, it would
still be unwise to expect anything better
than ordinary as regards profit and
dividend performance.
With the lone subsidiary (Glen Iris
Brick, Tile & Terra Cotta Co. Pty Ltd)
brickworks are run at Bulleen and Oak-
leigh (Vic.). The Bulleen w'orks produce
wire-cut bricks which have replaced to
a certain extent the old machine-pressed
bricks which are turned out at Oakleigh.
The 1963-64 year to February 29 was
the first full trading period at Bulleen
in which the European clay preparation
plant and brick making plant were inte-
grated and operated in conjunction with
the tunnel drying system.
A glance at the table shows just
how unfortunate operations have been
so far. Profit in the latest year barely
covered the reduced dividend require-
ment, but a capital profit of about
£2OOO on the sale of fixed assets allevia-
ted the position somewhat.
It must be remembered that the result,
as in 1962-63, was not subject to tax
because of the 20 p.c. investment allow-
ance granted on the new plant. In all
probability, this will not be the case in
the current year, so the outlook is de-
cidedly dimmed.

Probably the most crippling factor,
however, will be a lack of working
capital. Even if the company stands to
benefit from increased demand, it can
make little use of its position without
liquid cash on hand. Since listing, the
group’s working capital position has been
favorable at only one balance date. This
was February 28, 1962, when the figure
was £BB,OOO. In all other years it has
been negative.
The table also shows rather uneven
trends in the growth of fixed assets
which have gone up one year and down
the next. The big growth in the overall
total of loan capital also gives cause for
concern, especially as reserves and paid
capital have remained virtually un-
changed since 1961.
Of more direct concern to the share-
holders, however, are the earning rates,
dividends and share prices on the mar-
ket. Earnings have declined every year
since listing. The dividend was only
barely covered during its two-year stay
at 10 p.c. and this cover was just as
narrow in the latest year although the
payout was reduced to p.c. More-
over, share prices have slowly but surely
declined from between 10s. and 11s. to
the present prices of about ss. 3d.
What, then, of the future? Generally,
it seems that the finances of the group
are inadequate at present to enable any
vast recovery, all other factors being
favorable. The most probable forecast
is that the buoyant demand existing at
present will facilitate the establishment
of a solid financial structure on which
bigger and better performances can be
built in future years.
"C\)R those shareholders who are inter-
ested in the long-term, it would pro-
bably be to the good if directors omitted
dividends for a year or two in an effort
to build liquidity and reserves. But
having regard to their dividend policy
so far this is unlikely. So it could well
be the stock may prove to be a good
income investment—present yields are
in the vicinity of 7 p.c.
On a more specific basis, the group
should lift profits this year because of
economic conditions and the experience
now backing it after operating the new
plant at Bulleen over a full year. At
the annual meeting on May 7, the chair-
man said trading in March and April
had been steady while, at Bulleen, orders
on hand were better than in the previous
year at the same time.
Because of the experience at Bulleen,
and the fact that most of the early pro-
blems of the new plant have now been
overcome, wire-cut brick production
should run more smoothly this year.
Difficulty was also found with the pre-
paration of the hard reef clay but new
techniques have indicated that these will
shortly be overcome.
If profit does rise this year, the
achievement will not be without pro-
blems. In the first place, wire-cut bricks
have replaced' machine-pressed bricks to
the extent that production at Oakleigh
now exceeds demand. This must inevi-
tably mean price reduction and com-
petition with other manufacturers, many
of whom are much stronger than Glen
Iris.
The current shortage of skilled and
experienced labor in industry generally
will undoubtedly have some effect on the
brick industry also.
So, all in all, these factors and the
probability of tax charge this year indi-
cate that any gains will be purely mar-
ginal. If an investment in the shares
has any future, it definitely lies in the
medium to long term field. Short-term
prospects are extremely poor except for
the possibility of takeover and the fact
that directors apparently intend to pay
whatever dividend the earnings cover
each year.

REED PAPER PRODUCTS (HLDGS) LTD
Two Years of Hard Going
A one-for-two bonus from Reed
Paper Products (Holdings) Ltd,
though seemingly generous, will mean
only a small increase in dividend income
to shareholders.
The new dividend rate is 14 p.c.,
which is equivalent to 21 p.c. on the
pre-bonus capital, compared with past
payments of 20 p.c.
Source of the bonus is share premiums
(they stood at £120,176 on June 30,
1963, but have been augmented since)
and part of the surplus arising from re-
valuation of freehold properties and in-
vestments.
This revaluation was recently effected
after expert valuations showed that
values of properties and investments
were greatly in excess of book value.
(At June 30, 1963, land and buildings
were shown in the books at £531,653
after a depreciation provision of
£101,161 and leasehold amortisation of
£8338.)
Directors advised shareholders in their
notification of the bonus that the balance
of assets revaluation account after the
bonus would be £506,919. The issue of
1,032,964 ss. bonus shares brings paid
capital to £774,723.
Shares of the company were first listed
on Sydney Exchange in June, 1961,
after a 15 p.c. shareholding formerly
held by Reed Australia Pty Ltd was
placed with the public.
Reed Australia Pty Ltd was a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Albert E. Reed and
Co. Ltd, the largest maker of paper and
packaging materials in the UK.
Ownership of Reed Paper Products
(Holdings) Ltd was then 15 p.c. by the
public, 5 p.c. Edwards Dunlop and Co.
Ltd, 8 p.c. CSR, and 72 p.c. by Reed
and Associates Pty Ltd. The share-
holding in Reed and Associates was 22
p.c. CSR, 7 p.c. Edwards Dunlop and
71 p.c. Albert E. Reed.
Albert E. Reed, therefore, had direct
and indirect control of 51 p.c. of the
shares, and provision was made in the
Articles to maintain this percentage.
Manufacturing activities were con-
ducted by Reed Paper Products Pty with
plants at Waterloo (NSW) making corru-
gated and solid fibre containers, cartons,
paper bags and playing cards, and paper-
bag plants at Brisbane, Adelaide and
Newcastle, and by Reed Paper Products
(Victoria) Pty, with a corrugated and
solid fibre container plant in Melbourne.
A 25 p.c. interest is held in Tas-
manian Containers Pty, which makes
corrugated and solid fibre containers in
Launceston and Hobart, and a 50 p.c.
interest in Fibreboard Containers Ltd
making similar products in Adelaide.
In 1962-63 E. C. Blackwood Pty,
paper-bag manufacturer, paper wrap-
pings and stationery distributor of South
Melbourne, was acquired for a cash con-
sideration, and E. E. Sturgess and Sons
Pty, paper-bag manufacturer and dis-
tributor of West Melbourne, for cash
and shares. In November last a Sydney
paper-bag maker and distributor, Priest
Bros Pty, was bought for cash.
Despite the distinguished patronage of
the UK group, the Australian business
has not had an easy time in the last two
years. Profit slumped heavily in 1961-62
due to declining demand by established
customers, competition from imports
and from the local packaging field
crowded by new entrants.
Earning rate fell accordingly from
35.4 p.c. to 22.3 p.c. and made partial
recovery in 1962-63 to 28.1 p.c.
Profit for the year to June 30, 1963,
was £145,050 after providing £70,028
for tax and £115,937 for depreciation.
Interim report for the December half
of this current year told of higher sales
and profit, and an interim dividend of
10 p.c. A final 7 p.c. will be paid in
October on old and new' bonus shares.
On a pre-bonus market price of 31s.
the shares should reduce to 20. Bd. ex
bonus, giving an income yield on the
new dividend of 3.4 p.c. and earnings
yield of 4.5 p.c.
The low yield on which the shares
are habitually rated is more a mark of
respect to the parent company and its
relations with CSR and Edwards Dunlop,
plus the technical factor that there are
not many shares available, than to its
performance so far on the public stage.

How the Cookie Crumbles
Turning rate of George Weston Foods
Ltd, English owned bread, cake and
biscuit group operating in Australia and
New Zealand, was 9.3 p.c. for the year
to December 31, 1963.
Profit was £933,684 after tax of
£604.416 and depreciation of £999,380.
It includes results for 14 months from
Millmasfer Feeds Pty. for nine months
from South Coast Bakeries Pty (both of
NSW), and for four months from
W. Thomas Industries Pty and
W. Thomas and Co. Pty. Amvlo Pro-
ducts Pty and A. McAulay and Co. Pty
(all of SA). Results from the 14 WA
companies were treated as pre-acquisi-
tion profits.
The group has 62 subsidiaries in Aus-
tralia and eight in NZ. The company
was incorporated in May, 1962, to take
over the Australasian interests of Associ-
ated British Foods Ltd of the UK.
During 1962 it acquired N. B. Lev*
Industries and through its Tip Top
Bakeries subsidiaries extended bakery
interests by buying up businesses ru-
Canberra, Sydney. Melbourne, Brisbane
and Auckland. The chain was
Australia-wide by purchases in SA and
WA during 1963.
Comparisons with trading results for
1962 are largely invalidated by 1963
acquisitions.
Although the company is not publicly
listed, its activities are of special interest
in view of the recent struggle between
Nabisco of the US and the Australian
Biscuit Company for the crumbling
Swallow and Ariell business.
Furthermore it could one day achieve
public listing in Australia, although its
present financial structure does not
impress.
Capital is £lO million, supported by
revenue surplus of only £59,360. Good-
will appeared in the 1963 accounts at
£4.350.000 (1962, £4.700,000) although
£857,961 of 1963 profit was used to
write down this account.
Fixed assets grew' over the year by a
net £3,507,000 as a result of acquisitions
and expenditure on new buildings, plant
and vehicles.
Record sales were reported, and Tip
Top products particularly cakes and
pastries—are receiving wider acceptance,
A very significant proportion of the
profit increase was from biscuits and
millings. Unsatisfactory bread margins
and restrictions on baking hours still
trouble the company.
Major developments in 1963 were the
acquisition of flour mills in Victoria,
SA and WA, and of seven bakery com-
panies in WA.
The company told The Bulletin that
during the original battle for the biscuit
market fought by Arnotts (now part oi
the Australian Biscuit Co.) and Swallow
and Ariell, Weston increased its share
of the market by a “considerable pro-
portion and that this percentage has in-
creased regularly and without inter-
ruption for ten years . . /’
It also made the point that, without
reflecting on the management of the
Australian Biscuit Co., the history ol
Nabisco in the US has shown the im-
possibility of any company maintaining
a very' high proportion of the biscuit
market for any length of time.
Weston thus makes it apparent that
it believes the Australian Biscuit Co.
(now r incorporating Swallows, and con-
trolling nearly 80 p.c. of the biscuit
market in this country) has more to
fear in an invasion by Nabisco than
have Weston or Peek Frean.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Beef Crisis Helps Australia
Confusion between UK and Europe
From R. J. SCHOLFIELD in London
Tn the past few weeks the roast beef
1 of old England has been more in the
public eye than the public mouth.
Beef became news when the Press
noticed that French buying in English
markets was putting up the price of beef
to British housewives and virtually drag-
ging them in among the dizzy food levels
of a Common Market from which the
self-same country had only two years
ago excluded them.
The subject has been fraught with
contradictions, exaggerations and politics
arising from the interaction of Britain’s
low-priced free market and the high-
priced Continental one that is normally
walled off by tariffs but which has now
opened its gates.
One newspaper says prices are rocket-
ing to £1 a lb. Another says they have
fallen. Some blame the Tories, some
Labor.
Professor John Hammond, world
authority on animal production, predicts
that beef will soar for the next 18
months.
A top farming journal thinks there
is much ado about nothing.
The broiler industry is fattening on
doubts, and housewives are being told
to buy more lamb. The Government is
being pressed to recover subsidies on
British-produced meat that is exported.
Soames, Agriculture Minister whom
some blame for the crisis through
discouraging home production, refuses
to disturb the freedom of the British
Market. Some consumers are boycotting
beef. Others are carrying Britishly on,
seeing no change. And BBC television
founds off the confusion by taking its
cameras to Paris and proving that
Bfench shoppers are paying less for
fillet than the French butchers who
bought it in Norfolk.
Amid the confusion, the British Gov-
ernment has stated that one of the objec-
tions to deterring Continental buying is
that to do so would divert overseas beef
direct to the Continent, putting even
more strain on home supplies and defeat-
ing the purpose of a system designed to
provide cheap food. So far as Aus-
tralian beef is concerned, the diversion
has already begun.
The Australian Meat Board’s Euro-
pean representative, Mr D. B. Muirhead,
is in no doubt that a world meat short-
age exists. Last November it began to
show up in Europe, where consumption
a head has risen much faster than
expected, especially in France, Italy and
Greece.
TI/lost of Europe’s beef conies from its
dairy herds. France and Yugoslavia
are exceptions, but even here the per-
centage of dairy-produced beef is high.
Because of world dairy surpluses, there
is a reluctance to increase dairy cow
numbers. Increases in beef production
thus depend largely on the growing of
more male and unwanted female calves
to heavier weights.
In some parts of Europe, Govern-
ment policies have not encouraged
farmers to do this and total cattle
numbers have remained static or
declined.
Towards the end of last year it be-
came evident that Argentina, largest and
cheapest source of beef for most Euro-
pean countries, could not even maintain
its present volume of exports, let alone
cope with the shortage that was develop-
ing in Europe. So prices began to rise.
The European situation was aggra-
vated by the severity of the 1962-63
winter, when farmers, faced with high
costs to feed stock, let numbers dwindle.
It was also worsened by the shortage
of pigmeat in Europe, although bacon
and pork are now catching up and will
soon ease the pressure on beef.
Yugoslavia reduced supplies to the
British market, on which as a newcomer
she had made some impact in recent
years, and directed them to Italy, a
traditional customer and a country
where the drift of workers from the
south to the higher living standards of
the industrial north was lifting meat con-
sumption faster than anywhere else in
Europe.
At this time most of Australia’s beef
was going to the United States, but
American production had risen to the
point where pressure was being applied
to curb imports and agreement had been
reached between the two Governments
that Australia should limit shipments.
At the same time, prices were easing in
the US for the small proportion of Aus-
tralian first and second quality cuts
reaching that market, so Australian con-
signments of this class were tending to
move back to the UK.
The shortage of beef in Europe and
the failure of Argentina to meet it
focused the attention of France, Italy
and Greece on this Australian meat, and
both official and commercial delegations
from these countries have been visiting
Australia in the past six months, giving
us worthwhile outlets in Europe for the
first time. As an answer to the American
squeeze, the upsurge of European
interest could not have been better timed.
In Greece, Australian meat exports
have been helped by a restriction on
Argentinian and Uruguayan exports
through foot-and-mouth disease. The
opening, valuable as it is as an additional
solution to the American problem, has
presented Australian exporters with the
challenge of adjusting to specifications
of cut and trim. Not that they are
entirely without this kind of experience.
Following a recent survey by the Meat
Board in the United Kingdom, supplies
now sent to that market meet definite
specifications for cut, trim and fat cover.
Since last Christmas, Mr Muirhead
has spent much time on the Continent
telling European importers about Aus-
tralia’s potential and helping to put them
in touch with Australian exporters. He
has been on the spot when shipments
arrive so that he can report back on their
reception and say what modifications, if
any, are needed.
“I am confident,” Mr Muirhead said
last week, “that Australian exporters will
meet the challenge here as well as they
did in the US in 1959-60.”
But he thinks the sooner liaison is
established between Australian exporters
and their customers, the better it will be


because such contact is needed to ensure
that supply and demand are properly
matched.
One adjustment that may be called for
is a reduction in the amount of fat that
has customarily accompanied Australian
beef.
The world shortage of beef is palpable
enough to the Australian Meat Board,
but how long will it last? It could be
years before reaction to the shortage
once again balances supply and demand.
The Australian beef industry has got
its hoof in the door of Europe. Which
side it will be on if the door finally
closes again will depend on how well
Australian exporters meet the special
needs of their new markets.
Manipulating Wool Prices
Grazier-statist blames UK buyers
Wool is at the moment coming out of
a dip in prices which, during May,
looked ominous. From 146 d. for clean
average 64's in February the price drop-
ped to 119 d. in mid-May.
The general view now is that this was
a minor recession and that the overall
figures for the year will be quite good.
But it depends on how you look at it and
to what extent you are involved.
If you are a big woolgrower (selling,
say, 100 bales and upwards) you pro-
bably would be able to refrain from
selling during the low period or you
might sell in, say, three consignments
spread over the year.
But if you happen to be one of the
80 per cent of woolgrowers who sell 50
bales or less a year, then May could
well have been a black month.
You might, if you were a 30-bale man,
for instance, be down £5OO just because
your wool happened to reach the auction
floor in May instead of February. If
a 90-bale man —down £lsoo—you might
not be able to get that new tractor.
Man On The Land, along with many
observers, accepted the view that the
drop was caused by withdrawal of
Japanese interest brought on by mone-
tary restrictions imposed by the Japanese
Government.
This seemed an eminently feasible ex-
planation. But that dedicated crusader
for marketing change, Mr Lawrence
Simpson, of Nowranie Pastoral Co.,
Oaklands (NSW), offers another' expla-
nation. And once again, because he has
his claim backed up with facts and
figures, Mr Simpson is difficult to refute.
Moreover, reports this week indicate
that the Japanese are buying again and
that they, therefore, might reasonably be
supposed to have held off during May
just to see how low the market would
drop. When a market is falling it is a
natural reaction of any buyer to hope it
might fall lower still.
Simpson puts the blame for the May
recession fairly and squarely on the
heads of the United Kingdom buyers.
They manipulated it very cleverly, he
says.
From his sources of information in the
UK (he is a most precise collector of
data) he has learned that stocks of
Merino wool in the UK were reduced by
over 16 per cent between the end of
January and the end of March. This
happened in spite of the fact that the
consumption of Merino wool for
January-March was ahead of that of last
year.
In other words the higher prices for
wool had not stopped people buying
woollen garments.
This reduction in stocks amounted to
9.7 million pounds or, in round figures,
about 48,000 bales.
As Australia and South Africa are the
main suppliers of Merino wool, with
Australian leading seven to one, this
means that some 40,000 bales of Austra-
lian wool w'ere used from stocks held
and not purchased during this period.
This is 5000 bales of wool a w'eek not
purchased here in the auction rooms.
By partially withdrawing from the
market the UK, therefore, depressed the
market, says Simpson, who believes that
the UK will replenish its stocks when the
price suits.
It is a parallel with 1961. In that
year UK stocks were reduced from May
to November by 26.1 million pounds at
a time when consumption was the high-
est then recorded.
The UK wool manufacturers were
then able to replace 13.7 million pounds
of their stocks at the lowest levels of
the year and 14d. a pound below the
price that was ruling in May.
Simpson suggests the same thing will
happen again this year. The market
will come back but slowly. Once de-
pressed, recovery always takes time.
During this recovery period, the buyers
will be able to replenish their stocks at
the reduced prices.
Simpson is borne out by figures from
another source which suggest that in
mid-February the return per bale was
around £9O. Taking into account the
May recession, the season figure is expec-
ted to be around £BO a bale average. (At
the peak Geelong topped £lOO a bale.)
Simpson asserts, of course, that this
manipulation of the market is strong
argument for a reserve price scheme so
that growers are not victimised by the
low points of the season's selling.
It is yet another argument for market-
ing first and promotion second.
He continues to assert that the fear
that synthetics will oust wool is a gim-
mick dreamed up by the public-relations-
conscious Australian Wool Board and
International Wool Secretariat; that
whatever happens to wool, the world is
going to need synthetics because wool
cannot meet all the growing world de-
mand for apparels.
Significantly Simpson, working alone
from his sheep station in the Riverina,
got hold of the figures of the UK stocks
reduction whilst no mention of this
phenomenon came from the big IWS
set-up located in London.
It is not without interest that Simpson
is an old antagonist of the UK wool
manufacturers. Some years ago—even
before he launched his main attack on
the Wool Board, in fact—he made a
private survey of the UK companies in
wool manufacturing, and produced some
illuminating figures right down to the
amounts distributed as directors’ fees.
Some of them were quite staggering.
One company made a profit in one
year of 310 p.c. and, on an ordinary
capital of £240,000, distributed £36,000
as directors’ remunerations.
“Outdated machinery" etc., may not be
the only reason that the UK is slipping
behind Japan as a wool manufacturer.
Simpson and the other campaigners for
marketing changes are anxiously awaiting
the Wool Board's marketing committee
report on July 16-17 in Canberra.
Of interest is the report of the chair-
man, Mr T. C. Trumble, at the annual
general meeting of Younghusband Ltd
(woolbrokers and stock and station
agents) recently.
He said: “Next month we are to be
advised of the lengthy and wide investi-
gations by the Wool Marketing Com-
mittee of the Australian Wool Board.
Any change or variation recommended
to the present method of disposal will
not be introduced prior to the com-
mencement of the 1965-66 season, but
there is a deal of interest and specula-
tion as to what their report will say.
“I have confidence in the committee
to fairly judge all aspects of their im-
portant assignment, and await the result
of their deliberations with interest.”
Sugar Record Tipped
HHhe director of the Bureau of Sugar
Experiment Stations in Queensland
(Mr N. King) estimates that the 31 sugar
mills in that State will crush a total of
13,290,000 tons from 469,000 acres
during 1964.
If this estimate is realised, 1,913,000
tons of 94 net titre sugar should be
produced. This would exceed the 1962
Queensland record of cane tonnage by
1,200,000 tons.

Only a Matter of £2000
Tractor-testing station could be saved
rTHE tractor-testing station at Werribee,
subject of much stormy debate over
the last six months, may win through
after all.
All States have agreed—through the
Australian Agricultural Council —to con-
tinue their present annual payments to-
wards administrative costs (about £BOOO
a year) provided an additional £4OOO is
available for the testing committee to
buy tractors at random and sell them
after testing.
Victoria's Minister for Agriculture,
Mr Chandler, has said that Victoria will
provide half this extra £4OOO if the
Federal Government will do likewise.
Although there is a matter of a State
election on June 27 the Victorian offer
appears unlikely to be imperilled on this
score.
It remains for the Minister for Pri-
mary Industry, Mr Adermann, to de-
cide if Federal funds can be provided to
the tune of £2OOO over and above the
Federal share of the £BOOO administra-
tive cost of the station.
It is hardly an amount for anyone to
get excited about. So it is likely that
the “buy and test” idea, mentioned be-
fore in these pages, will get a chance.
It will remove the big handicap the
station has had to date—-namely, the
reluctance of the tractor trade to support
the station.
The station, administered by Mel-
bourne University, has held strongly to
the idea that it must be able to select
tractors at random for the tests to mean
anything . . . “the sort you can buy”.
The tractor trade has claimed that
this is unrealistic and unfair . . . “when
you buy a tractor you have it tuned”.
Both sides have made some good
points and both sides appear to be fur-
ther from agreement than ever.
Meanwhile, a far more comprehen-
sive testing idea has been put forward by
a group known as the Agricultural
Equipment Committee.
This group estimates that if all farm
machinery were tested —at an outlay of
about £40,000 a year—the savings to
Australian farmers could amount to
£960,000 a year.
The Agricultural Equipment Commit-
tee is made up of representatives of the
Australian Institute of Agricultural
Science, Australian Primary Producers’
Union, Graziers’ Association of Victoria,
and the Victorian Dairyfarmers’ Associa-
tion.
The suggestion has been forwarded to
the Australian Agricultural Council
which consists of the Department of
Primary Industry and the Agriculture
Departments of the States.
Most of the Agricultural Equipment
Committee’s figures are based on tests of
farm machinery carried out in Canada.
This is in itself interesting and is yet
another example of the lead Canada is
giving us in so many matters related to
agriculture.
Only a few weeks ago Mr Adermann
visited some of Canada’s extension cen-
tres in Ontario Province and was repor-
ted as being most favorably impressed.
Many of the younger university men,
including the head of the veterinary
school at Melbourne University, Profes-
sor Douglas Blood, have studied in
Canada.
The farm machinery testing plan is
likely to be discussed by Mr Adermann
with the Agricultural Council when it
meets in July.
The Agricultural Equipment Commit-
tee does not in any way suggest that
tractor testing at Werribee should be en-
compassed in this wider ideal, but obvi-
ously the two matters are likely to come
up together.
How can a testing scheme like this
be related to savings to the farmer?
The Agricultural Equipment Commit-
tee claims that the biggest saving would
be related to durability of machinery.
Independent test-reports could help
farmers choose the right machine and
the right implement.
Safety, convenience and ease of
maintenance would also come into the
testing programme.
Tests would be functional —how well
the machine works and how long it
works. There would be both on-station
and on-farm tests.
The plan envisages a staff of 16 in-
cluding a £4OOO-a-year director.
Only a Jeremiah would throw cold
water on this plan of the Agricultural
Equipment Committee. It is a good
plan just as the tractor-testing station
is, whether it remains independent of
the wider scheme or not.
But the question must be asked —why
should the Government, and the tax-
payer, have to pay for all this?
If the reports on machinery will save
the farmer as much as is claimed, should
not the farmers be prepared to pay, say,
10s. each for one annual report? This
would more than meet the cost.
Or, alternatively, should not a small
levy be put on the purchase price of
every implement and piece of farm
machinery (already free of sales tax) to
pay for testing?
Logically the burden of payment for
testing belongs to the buyer of the items
tested.
