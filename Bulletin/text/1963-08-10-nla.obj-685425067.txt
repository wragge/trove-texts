Understanding Each Other
national language of Indonesia
-*■ spoken by 110,000,000 South Asians
is not taught in NSW secondary
schools despite the fact that at the Uni-
versity of Sydney the number of stu-
dents taking Indonesian and Malayan
studies has doubled each year for the
last three years. This year first-year stu-
dents number 170.
The NSW Education Department is
out of touch with the times. The WEA
and the Sydney Technical College both
run well-attended Indonesian language
classes. A WEA student who is also a
Commonwealth public servant was re-
cently sent to Indonesia to establish re-
lations with the equivalent Indonesian
department. There are two firms in Syd-
ney doing extensive business in Malaya
which now send their employees to
Malay language classes.
One problem arising from the Educa-
tion Department’s reluctance to teach
Indonesian in the schools is that of
Teachers’ College scholarships which
only cover those subjects in a student’s
final year that he is going to teach. There-
fore as Indonesian is not taught in
secondary schools a student who wishes
to major in Indonesian and Malayan
studies must do so at his own expense.
Even if the Department decides to in-
troduce Indonesian into secondary
schools there will be a delay of three
years before a sufficient number of
teachers of Indonesian can be provided
and yet another four years 1970
before a significant number of Indones-
ian language students pass out of the
secondary school system.
Quite apart from the obvious advan-
tages of learning Indonesian (virtually
identical with Malay), provided the stu-
dent does his work it can be learnt
more quickly than French or German,
principally because nouns are not de-
clined, verbs are not conjugated and
spelling is phonetic.
“Playboy” Being Scrutinised
T>umors swept Melbourne last week
that the June issue of “Playboy”
was about to be banned by the State
authorities. In fact, late on Friday the
Acting Attorney-General, Mr Hamer,
and Crown Law officials were examin-
ing copies of the magazine. More par-
ticularly they were looking at the eight-
page “The Nudest Jayne Mansfield”
feature, showing the actress in a series
of bubble-bath and boudoir poses. When
The Bulletin went to press a ban was
believed to be imminent. By this stage,
it would have been quite superfluous,
since hardly a copy was to be found for
sale in Melbourne.
All issues of “Playboy” have been
banned in Queensland but the H.M.H.
Publishing Company is contesting the
ban in the Supreme Court.
Copies of the magazine, have been
selling like hot cakes in Sydney for the
past week or so.
Organisation
barrage of eggs and flour-bombs
which greeted Sir William Gunn
when he opened the campaign for the
increased wool levy at Hamilton (Vic.)
last week was far from spontaneous.
Several days before Sir William spoke
stories were circulating in Melbourne
about the eggs and flour packets being
stockpiled.
A Hamilton identity, it was claimed,
was foraging the countryside in search
of emu eggs for ammunition. One Mel-
bourne newspaper took the reports
sufficiently seriously to arrange for a
picturegram transmitter to be sent to
Hamilton. As a result, it was able to get
into its editions a fine picture of Sir
William coated in flour. The organisers
of the Hamilton hooliganism ran com-
pletely out of steam after their initial
effort. All of Sir William’s subsequent
meetings have been orderly and free of
this yahoo-type direct action.
Balinese Ballerinas
A tour of the Dancers of Bali has
been on again, off again, for several
weeks, mainly because the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust didn’t have suitable
theatres free at the time the dancers
were available. The dancers are now
expected to begin their tour on Sep-
tember 2.
Part of the cost of the tour is being
met by the Shell Oil Company. There
is no political significance in this, nor
has it got anything to do with Shell’s
early interest in Indonesian oil. It is
part of the Elizabethan’s plan to try to
get industry and business to underwrite
culture. Newspapers have been the main
contributors to this year’s opera season
and there isn’t much connection between
papers and opera.
Waking audiences up
Carroll’s production of the
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical
“The King and I” has come 11 years
after the first Broadway production,
which is a pretty long time even for Aus-
tralian audiences to wait. However, it is
following its successful Melbourne run
with good houses in Sydney.
It may be a case of if you wait long
enough anything will come back into
fashion. Canadian actor Bill Yule, who
was choreographer for the production
as well as taking a part in it, pointed
out to us that in the meantime the
“problem” musical, the “West Side
Story” type of thing, had come and
gone.
“You can’t get away for long from
the fact that people go to the theatre to
be entertained,” he said. “Most people
have eaten and drunk well before they
get there. They want a bright overture,
with plenty of brass, to wake them up
before they even begin to take in what’s
happening. A musical comedy can’t
teach people what it might take a life-
time of lectures to do.”
Yule said he knew “West Side Story”
had been a failure in Australia, but
it hadn’t been a financial success in New
York. He had toured in “West Side
Story,” beginning in Florida. “In the
southern States they couldn’t care less
about a musical on the color question,”
he said. “They just don’t know what all
the fuss is about. We played in a theatre
in which the Negroes in the case couldn’t
use the restaurant or bar, and to segre-
gated audiences. In the whole run in
the south not one Negro saw the show.”
Yule said, however, the Actors’ Equity
in the United States always insisted on a
clause in actors’ contracts that they need
not play in any segregated theatre unless
they wished.
Yule said it was essential for musicals
in America, even after a successful
Broadway run, to go on tour for the
production to begin to make money. An
exception might be something like
Lerner and Loewe’s “Camelot,” which,
coming after their “My Fair Lady,” had
such terrific advance bookings that it
could keep going for months, whether
it proved good or bad. In his view, it


wasn’t terribly good a pretty pre-
tentious, solemn bore.
Loss to Music
the last Saturday in July, the Mel-
bourne “Age” carried a review of
a new work for violin and viola by
Dorian le Gallienne. It was the first
work to be published by the Melbourne
University Press in a series of Australian
compositions, and represented something
of a break-through for local music, since
the bulk of our music printing consists
of simple teaching pieces. On the same
day Dorian le Gallienne died after the
short recurrence of an old illness. At 48,
he was still a young composer, whose
creative work covered barely 20 years.
Our Melbourne music critic, Kenneth
Hince, writes: In the late ’forties le
Gallienne was appointed to the teach-
ing staff of the University Conserva-
torium, and retained this post until his
death. This work made great inroads
into the time and energy he could give
to his own composition. Some of his
best pupils have left Australia one at
least is teaching in London so that the
result of his teaching will probably be
dispersed and not concentrated in Aus-
tralia. From this point of view it would
have been to our advantage had le
Gallienne confined himself to composi-
tion, since the body of his work, while
remaining a major contribution to Aus-
tralian music, is fairly small.
For a radio performance of “Othello”
in the later ’forties he composed several
short but attractive incidental pieces, and
for a Union Theatre production of “Peer
Gynt,” about the turn of the decade, a
much more substantial suite of pieces for
chorus and orchestra. Several of these
movements appeared on the programme
of a concert of his own music which he
gave in the early fifties, shortly before
leaving for England for a period of ad-
vanced study.
The concert was in itself a remarkable
event. It was for one thing the first
one-composer concert of local music
which we had heard for a great many
years, and the quality of its work was a
token that Australian composition was,
in le Gallienne’s generation, coming to
terms with international creative music
on fully adult terms.
Le Gallienne returned from England
with, one suspects, a more confident
understanding of the problems of orches-
tral composition. Shortly afterwards he
completed the E major Symphony, and
within a few years the “Sinfonietta.”
With the Symphony of Robert Hughes,|
and apart from music still unperformed,!
these two works remain the only Mel-
bourne landmarks in the symphonic com-
position of this generation.
Soon after his return from England
le Gallienne was offered the critic’s posi-
tion with the Melbourne “Argus”, and
moved from there to “The Age” in 1957.
This work, and his writing for the Coun-
cil of Adult Education, took further time
from composition, but they have almost
certainly made the burdens of other
local composers a little lighter. For le
Gallienne was at no time a man to push
his own barrow. His own affairs made
it possible for him to compose without
looking to composition for a living; and
his temperament allowed him to con-
sider the artistic and financial troubles of
other composers without thought of his
own gain. His death is as much a loss
to Australian composers as it is to Aus-
tralian composition.

THIS AUSTRALIA
ALP CONFERENCE
A Party Drained
of All Energy
The iveird story of Labor’s new defence policy
FROM ALAN REID IN PERTH
[?]. E. CHAMBERLAIN
Hareing off
TPhe basic weakness in the ALP was
revealed during the proceedings at
:he Federal Conference held in Perth
ast week. The Right wing was not in
eontrol. Nor was the Left wing.
Neither side was in a mood to antago-
nise the other side. Policy decisions were
so ambiguous that they were open to op-
posed interpretations.
This current weakness of the ALP
showed up particularly on defence. The
ambiguous nature of the resolutions that
were to come were forecast by the
Federal Parliamentary Labor leader, Mr
Calwell, and the ALP Federal president,
Mr J. Keeffe, who is State secretary of
the Left-wing Queensland ALP, in their
major addresses.
Calwell hinted timidly that he
would like for electoral purposes a
modification of ALP policy insisting
upon the recall of Australian forces in
Malaya. Keeffe, titular head of the
ALP Federal machine, said precisely the
opposite. -
Neither Right nor Left wings were
in a fighting mood. It was almost as
though the fiercely-fought special ALP
March conference in Canberra had
drained delegates’ energies.
Delegates from both Right and Left
wing States leaned over backward to
avoid friction and conflict. Whereas in
Canberra in March votes were being
deadlocked 18/18, vote after vote last
week went 33/3 in favor of official
recommendations. But the official
recommendations were both ambiguous
and colorless, as they had to be if they
were to secure the support of NSW,
South Australia and Tasmania on the
Right-wing side, and Victoria, Queens-
land and Western Australia on the Left-
wing side.
The defence decisions were so vague
that even after they had been made and
handed out to the Press the ALP
Federal Conference was not sure what
they were. Only when pressmen asked
if the announced decisions meant that
the policy obligation upon a future
Labor Government to recall Australian
troops in Malaya still stood that the con-
ference realised it did not have a
decision on this issue.
Mr Chamberlain is reported to have
gone hareing off to key figures at the
conference, as a result of which there
was an anxious thumbing-through of
policy decisions made at former con-
ferences and an examination made of
the present status of such decisions.
This homework revealed a mess. At the
March, Canberra, conference, NSW
ALP president C. T. Oliver had moved
a resolution which could be interpreted
as allowing a future Labor Government
to send troops overseas under certain
conditions, though, typically, there was
no compulsion upon any hypothetical
future Labor Government or ALP
machine controllers to give it this in-
terpretation. Against this, Clyde
Cameron, MHR, at the Conference as a
South Australian representative, had
moved an amendment reiterating
that Australian troops must be recalled
from Malaya. Both Oliver’s and Camer-
on’s motions had been defeated 18/18
at the Canberra conference.
Oliver seized the opportunity. Though
there has been no shift in power
within the Federal ALP Conference
since the Canberra conference, when the
Right had for all practical purposes 18
supporters and the Left also had 18
supporters, the confusion this time
strengthened Oliver’s hand.
Something had to be done. It was
done. His motion was endorsed. It was
decided that this motion should replace
the earlier unmistakable and unequivocal
demand for the recall from Malaya of
the Australian troops.
Five hours after Mr Chamberlain had
issued Labor’s defence policy, and some
of the most senior ALP officials running
the Conference had insisted that ALP
policy continued to be the recall of Aus-
tralian troops, Mr Oliver’s motion was
put out as the new Labor policy.
Actually the new policy is so
ambiguous that it suits both sides while
helping Labor electorally. It can now
be said that Labor is not flatly against
troops in Malaya. Yet, if the Left wing
ever gets a majority on the ALP Federal
Conference and Executive, it will be able
to justify the recall of Australian troops
under its terms when a Labor Govern-
ment comes to power.
The defence resolutions, and the way in
which they were produced, were typical
of the way that, at this Conference,
Labor has balanced between the stools
of Right and Left wings on the tightrope
of ambiguity, obscurity and, to some
degree, the tiredness left over from the
March, Canberra, fight.


THE SECRETARIAT
Wyndham Moves
to Canberra
His voice will grow shriller
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Dr H. V. EVATT
His recruit
A ppointed last week as the ALP’s first
full-time Federal Secretary, Mr
Cyril Wyndham, 33, is already appre-
hensive about his impending shift to
Canberra to take up the £3OOO per an-
num job. Some, though not all of his
worries, stem from the slender financial
margin left to operate the new Federal
Secretariat after providing for his own
wages and those of two female secretar-
ies at £lOOO and £6OO per annum re-
spectively.
There is enough in the kitty to see the
Federal body through its first couple of
years, but after a lifetime as a servant of
X, .. , , A . T , ..
the British and Australian Labor parties,
™n 4 , ’
Mr Wyndham l.kes to look further ahead
than that. He realises that the recent ex-
pulsion of Mr W. O Brien from the Vic-
torian ALP for Unity Ticket offences
may set off a chain of events which could
ultimately hit the finances of both the
Victorian and the Federal ALP. With Mr
O’Brien found guilty, logic points to the
expulsion of up to eight other ALP mem-
bers who committed the same offence in
the same Railways Union election.
ARU spokesmen have already hinted
that they may disaffiliate the union from
the ALP if the Victorian Executive per-
sists in its belated application of party
rules on Unity Tickets. The ARU, paying
fees of over £lOOO per annum, is the big-
gest union contributor of ALP funds in
Victoria. It would probably not disaffi-
bate alone, either, but would almost cer-
tainly stage a walk-out with other big
unions (Tramways and Wharfies, for
example) which are run by Unity Ticket
tea ™ s ' ... . . T _ ~,
The Victorian ALP would be hit finan-
• , ~ , . x .
cially and would be in no position to
contribule its agreed share to the new
Canberra Secretariat
There are other reasons why Mr Wynd-
ham is uneasy about his coming shift to
Canberra. Neither he nor his wife, a
former Pymble (NSW) girl whom he
married in 1959, make friends easily.
They are lonely, isolated people in Mel-
bourne and the move to a strange capital
does not appeal to them. In the two and
a half years he has been Victorian ALP
Secretary, Mr Wyndham has gradually
won respect for the hours and energy he
has devoted to his work. He is obviously
happy when referred to as “the mighty
atom”, but he is not a good mixer and
has never used the informality of a few
beers to lubricate the wheels of the party
machine. “You could never say his pleas-
ing personality has helped him in his job.
His drive and energy are the things people
around him admire,” was the comment
of one close colleague.
Apart from a period of national ser-
vice and a year at the London School of
Economics on a trade union scholarship,'
Mr Wyndham has been continuously em-
ployed by either the British or the Aus-
tralian Labor machines since the age of
17. In London, he climbed the ladder
at Transport House from clerical hand to
become an assistant to Mr Morgan
Phillips, the party’s then General Secre-
tary. Dr Evatt, visiting London in 1956,
took a liking to young Cyril Isaacs, as he
then was, and invited him to become his
Press Secretary. The young Englishman
had no apparent qualifications for the
job and subsequently indicated little flair
for it, either. After Dr Evatt's retirement,
he worked as Press Secretary to Mr Cal-
well until he was appointed Secretary of
the Victorian ALP in 1960, barely three
years after arriving in Australia. By this
time he had adopted his present name,
Wyndham, by deed poll. He claims he
made the change from Isaacs after ALP
friends told him it was advisable in the
Australian political atmosphere.
Mr Wyndham has not been identified
with any particular faction in the Vic-
torian party. He is always at pains to
point out that he is a civil servant of the
party whose function is to carry out pol-
icy, rather than make it. Nevertheless he
has grown very close to the party’s pre- ’
sident, Mr Bob Holt, and there is little
doubt that in recent months the two of
them have been fairly firmly in control
of the Victorian branch. One result of
the Wyndham-Holt axis was the expul-
sion of Mr O’Brien, another was the
purge of the Oakleigh Councillors on a
“State Aid” charge.
Mr Wyndham’s own political thinking j
is best reflected in the report he drew up ’
in 1962 on Victorian ALP organization.
He found the party much more dependent
on the unions than similar parties he had
studied abroad and obviously did not
care much for this state of affairs. “An
imbalance has developed, which is de-
trimental to the branch or individual
membership of the Party. On the part of
some trade unionists there is the feeling
that the party is for them and them alone
.". . a few trade unionists are not ready to
defend the integrity of the party.” This
was a veiled attack on Unity Ticket
ENGLAND MADE THEM
80 Years Ago: August 11, 1883
At the very moment when the
united voice of the Australian
colonies sounds a strong protest
against the French authorities for per-
mitting the scum of their penal estab-
lishments to flow upon our coasts, and
peremptory appeal is being made to
the Imperial Government to protect
us from this infliction at any cost, it
is not a little shocking to discover that
those same Imperial authorities have
been simultaneously doing, on their
own behoof, the very thing which we
have asked them to prevent others
from doing. It is not strange, it is
revolting to observe that the S. M.
HERALD calms down into a whin-
ingly apologetic tone when to injury
a disclosure of hypocrisy is added by
the Imperial authorities. The surrep-
titious dispatch of Irish murderers to
these colonies is an act of infamy.
These men participated in the murder
of officials; they gave their con-
federates to the hangman; and, above
all, they strangled the liberties of their
country. But for them and such as
they, Ireland might now have been
enjoying a measure of freedom won
by the constitutional efforts of the
PARNELLS and REDMONDS, and
other heroes of the moderate party.
Fated wretches, let them die where
they have lived. England must bear
her own burdens. There is only one
thing worthy to be done. Ship the
scoundrels back to the scoundrels
who sent them.

OBITUARY
A Man To the End of His
Forceful Fingertips
The end of an era
FROM ALAN REID
E. J. WARD
The old school
John (“Ned”) Ward was the
Federal Parliament’s last survivor
of the old Lang-bred school of tough
politician that dominated NSW politics
from the depression years onward. Ward
was ageing, his health, once superb, had
not been as good over recent years; but
to the last he could still top almost any
ballot in the Labor Party, outside that
for the leadership, on his personal popu-
larity and his indomitable courage and
tenacity.
In the House he was an ogre. He
could pull down the corners of his mouth
and set his face in a scowling mask,
intimidatory and savage. He would fix
speakers across the Chamber with a flat,
unwinking and unwavering stare that
would throw them nervously off balance.
But outside the House he was a delight-
ful man, with a magnificent sense of
humor and, particularly with women,
beautiful natural manners and a very
real charm. I have on occasion intro-
duced him at public functions to ladies
who were Liberal voters and who spoke
of him as though he were the devil in-
carnate, and then watched, amused, as
they succumbed to his very real dignity
and charm.
The House of Representatives, in
which he had been a prominent person-
ality since he entered it as a young fire-
brand from East Sydney in the depres-
sion ’thirties, will not be the same without
his fast talking, fearless, often contro-
versial presence. But, oddly, the loss will
be personal rather than political. Despite
his relative youth for the age at which
he died is not old in politics he had
somehow outlived his political age.
What he had over recent years was a
personal rather than an ideological in-
fluence. He was neither Right nor Left
in the modern usage of those words. He
always described himself as “a good
Leftist,” which, indeed, he was, in the
traditional Labor sense of the word.
But his radicalism had few of the
international overtones that go with
the modern ideologies. It was an in-
tensely Australian radicalism. It owed
little to outside sources.
Because of this his death leaves a big
gap in the Party, but it is a personal
thing, not a power vacuum. The group
that always, come hail, rain or shine,
were dedicatedly and unashamedly loyal
to him because of the associations that
went back to his youthful days, or just
because he was “Ned” and a unique but
distinctively Australian personality, will
now drift off to line up w'ith the Right
or the Left. For them, as for many in
Parliament, some of the zest will be gone.
For it was “Ned” whom this group fol-
lowed and worshipped rather than his
political views, which they accepted pure-
ly because they came from “Ned”.
Ward may have had faults, but they
were a man’s faults. He lived like a Spar-
tan. He did not drink nor smoke and
made no pretence of being other than
a dedicated family man. But he lived
life richly, with enjoyment, zest, and un-
flagging energy, ready at any moment for
a jest or a scrap and delighting in both,
but always with a quick, ready sympathy
for the underdog and under-privileged.
He was a man to the end of his forceful
fingertips.
ABORIGINES
Segregation
A Town like Merredin
FROM A WA CORRESPONDENT
VI/ords like segregation and integra-
" tion have been cropping up in
Western Australia in the last week. They
have been aired over an attempt by
the Native Welfare Department to in-
tegrate reserve-dwelling natives into the
white community in several country
towns.
In the large wheatbelt town of Mer-
redin, land had already been chosen and
housing plans approved by the local
Council for two native houses in the
township when a ratepayers' petition
from 50 residents caused it to change
ground, and withdrew its approval.
Native Welfare Minister C. Lewis,
a Country Party parliamentarian, im-
mediately fired off a blast at the Coun-
cil, accusing it of racial prejudice. Shire
President G. F. Telfer fired right back,


saying that Merredin was being used
for an experiment which would never be
permitted in Perth and inviting the
Minister to absorb natives into better-
class city suburbs like Dalkeith, Floreat
Park or Nedlands.
The basis of the Council attitude was
that only one of the native families on
the reserve was ready to live in the
white community, despite the fact that
the Native Welfare Department had
chosen three it considered ready for in-
tegration. One Councillor, Mr C. R.
Davies, accused the Department of in-
efficiency in caring for natives on the
town reserve.
Under such criticism, the Minister
wilted and said he would not build the
two houses if the Council protested.
“It would be futile to go ahead if it
produced antagonism in the town,” he
said. “It would be an unhappy position
for any family, native or otherwise, to
have to live in an area where the natives
were unfriendly.”
Twenty-four hours later he somer-
saulted again, and said he had not scrap-
ped the housing scheme but had decided
to hold it in abeyance till the Council
reconsidered its decision. In the mean-
time the Department would proceed with
the acquisition of the land. . . .
WOOL
Big Bill Gunn in the
Wild Western District
Men and Sheep
FROM A HAMILTON CORRESPONDENT
SIR W. GUNN
“I shall return”
Oefore the night of July 29, 1963,
Hamilton, in the middle of Vic-
toria’s lawn-lush Western District, was
famous for superfine Merino wool (and
as the birthplace of the Ansett trans-
port empire). But the events of that
night have assured Hamilton of a place
in Australian history maybe in the
section reserved for such incidents as
Eureka Stockade and the Cessnock coal
strike.
Unlike Eureka, there were no troopers
—or even ordinary beat pounders
on the night of July 29 at Hamilton’s
barn-like Town Hall. And if there were
any coalminers they were disguised in
West of England tweed. But there were
1300 Western District graziers and the
chairman of the Australian Wool Board,
Queensland grazier Sir William Gunn.
Sir William flew into Hamilton with
a team of Woo! Board public relations
chaps suitably wool-clad from their
socks to their narrow-brimmed Stetsons
—to convince the Western District that
a rise in the levy of 10s. to 445. a bale
was not too much to pay for wool pro-
motion.
There were whispers of a fruit and
egg attack somebody said emu eggs.
But nobody, least of all Bill Gunn,
listened too much ... after all, this was
Hamilton where millionaire w'oolgrowers
were chauffeured to town for a beer in
Rolls Royces, where Geelong Grammar
ties and accents were worn with elastic-
sided boots.
Then the big man got a shock. A
leading local grazier refused to shake
hands with him in the pub. “I won’t
shake hands with a parasite like you,”
he said. While Sir William and his
entourage were digesting this morsel of
Western District hospitality with a
steak dinner his audience was crushing
into the Town Hall, They came in
muddy Mercedes - Benz, Buick and
Jaguar cars, as well as Holden station
wagons. They brought dozens of
home-made signs denouncing Gunn
as a “Commo” and a “Fascist” and
demanding a new marketing system.
When the Town Hall caretaker, VC
winner Ted Kenna, tried to rip some
of the signs from the walls he was frog-
marched outside.
At last Sir William pushed his way
onto the stage to a fanfare of deafening
shouts and booing. He looked slightly
bewildered, but got straight into his
speech. He hadn’t gone two minutes
when he found that the talk of eggs
and fruit was true . . . they came whiz-
zing and splashing at him from all over
the hall rotten eggs (hen size),
tomatoes, lemons, flour bombs and
wads of paper.
Sir William ducked around a stage
wing until the barrage subsided—leav-
ing a local radio station microphone to
cop a direct hit. He reappeared, covered
in flour, to shout down the crowd.
For the next two hours he ducked
an occasional egg and continual derisive
roars. After three hours he sat down.
“I must say I have enjoyed myself,” he
said. His smile was triumphant.
The last half-hour of the longest,
stormiest speech he had ever made and
one of the most violent meetings ever
held in Victoria won Big Bill Gunn a
lot of support. The Wild Men clapped
tiredly as he strode alone from the
hall. It was 11 p.m. Everybody was
hoarse and there were many sore throw-
ing arms.
Next morning, before flying on to
Naracoorte, SA, Sir William promised
to return to Hamilton. “They made so
much bloody noise they couldn’t hear
what I had to tell them,” he said. “But
they couldn’t make me run and the
people who organised the demonstration
lost a lot of sympathy . . . they’ll listen
to me next time and I’ll bet they support
me.”
"Things were probably different in those days. They didn't pay to be
hit with a whip."

Louisiana Purchases
Over to the Investigators
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
STANLEY KORMAN
11 investigations
"jyiEEKLY taking his cue from the audi-
■*•*■*■ tors’ startling suggestions of mani-
pulations in the Reid Murray group,
Victoria’s Attorney-General, Mr Rylah,
swooped on the whole nest of Kormnn
companies last week, appointing official
investigators into eleven of them and
throwing in Testro’s little but high-sound-
ing “trustee” company (of no fixed abode
and no telephone number) for good
measure.
To some this looked a bit like shut-
ting the stable door a little late, what with
Hong Kong gentlemen here to pick up
Chevron Sydney for a song and bidders
urgently being sought for the bits and
pieces of Factors and so on. But it is
not too late for the investigators to ex-
pose the authors of any salting away of
funds that may have taken place on the
companies’ various roads to ruin and for
the Government to bring them to book.
The high living of some of the former
principals of the group appears not to
have been interrupted by their losing
so many millions of the public’s money.
Until last week there was a haunting
suspicion that manipulations along the
long line of Reid Murray’s 200 or more
subsidiaries might have contributed to
the group’s downfall, but this was
prompted more by the fact that the Vic-
torian Government had appointed official
investigators for 71 of the companies of
the group rather than any questioning
of the bona tides of former directors.
The auditors’ report on the group
accounts has turned suspicion into accu-
sation, and even if on its evidence only
a small fraction of the £l3 million ex-
pected loss on liquidation is likely to be
attributable to the manipulations men-
tioned, one director, a Maltese migrant,
Mr R. L. Borg, the former managing
director’s 32 year-old real estate prodigy
whose rise from rags to Toorak residency
and racecourse riches neatly spans the
period of Reid Murray’s own rise and
fall in Victoria, will have to come up
with some convincing answers for the
investigators.
The improper arrangements attributed
by the auditors to Mr Borg follow an all
too familiar pattern. For instance, there
was the purchase by Payne’s Properties
Pty Ltd (Borg was managing director
of the Louisiana group of building com-
panies owned by his relatives and their
nominees). To quote the auditors: “On
November 13, 1962, Payne’s Properties
acquired all the issued capital in Penn-
sylvania Services, Louisiana Building
Enterprises, and A. B. Smith and Sons.
The balance sheets of the companies
drawn up as at November 12, 1962, dis-
close, when consolidated, net tangible
assets of approximately £BO,OOO. The
consideration paid by the company was
£150,000 in cash. We are informed that
the vendors of the shares are all relatives
or nominees for relatives of Mr R. L.
Borg.”
The fact that the writing was on the
wall for Payne’s Properties by Novem-
ber, 1962, adds poignancy to this arran-
gement. Mr A. J. O'Grady, the former
managing director of RM, commenting
on this, declared that in fact a revalua-
tion of the assets of the three companies
had brought net tangible assets up to
£120,000 at the time of the sale. That
would still leave £30,000 to account for.
Then there are these cases in which
Mr Borg, in 1955 the unsuccessful appli-
cant for a part-time job at Payne’s Bon
Marche in Bourke Street, is in the next
few years lending substantial sums to
Reid Murray subsidiaries at very hand-
some interest rates.
The auditors say: “Mr Borg in his per-
sonal capacity advanced the sum of
£7600 to Payne’s Properties and £15,000
to Reid Murray Properties. During the
year to August 31, 1962, interest of
£3558 was paid on these loans” (the
rate of interest works out at 16.2 per
cent!).
Or take the mystery surrounding an
amount of £46,881 commission accrued
to Mr Borg for his services with Payne’s
Properties, of which £11,319 had been
drawn by August 31, 1962. Of this the
auditors say: “There is no agreement in
existence establishing any entitlement to
these sums, and there is no director’s
minute of either Reid Murray Holdings
or Payne’s Properties authorising the ac-
crual.”
But in their comment on the auditors’
report Mr J. O’Grady and Mr K. N.
Wilkinson say Mr Borg’s commissions
(at the rate of 5 per cent of net profits
before tax equal to about 8 per cent
on profits after tax) were authorised by
O’Grady and the unpaid amount of these
commissions was to be offset by the
£30,274 advanced to Gisborne Pastoral
Company (the Tax Commissioners will
be interested in that arrangement).
As for loans of £140,604 made to
directors and employees for the purpose
of acquiring Reid Murray shares, the
auditors say: “We have ascertained that
several of the former directors and em-
ployees deny any liability to make repay-
ment, furthermore, as a result of legal
opinion, it now appears that the loans
made to directors may have been made
in contravention of the Companies Act
and are possibly irrecoverable by legal
action.”
HIROSHIMA SUNDAY
War on the Peace Front
Pro-Peking Trotskyites v. Pro-Moscow Communists
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
A s well as having two Communist
Parties to choose from, we now
have two peace movements the pro-
Soviet Peace Committee for International
Co-operation and Disarmament and the
increasingly Red China-oriented Cam-
paign for Nuclear Disarmament. There
are a few smaller groups, but these two
more or less share the field between them.
This year’s “Peace” activities—centred
as usual around “Hiroshima Day”, the
anniversary of the dropping of the first
atomic bomb on that city—will take
the form of peace vigils, radial marches
to mass meeting points, etc., culminating
in the descent of a planned 1000 delegates
on Canberra on August 15.
The delegates plan to interview Fed-
eral MPs, stage a march through Can-
berra, hold a silent protest demonstration
outside the French Embassy, send deputa-
tions to embassies of those countries hav-
ing nuclear weapons, and present a
National Peace petition to Parliament.
This is the form these things usually
take. It is the fights beneath the surface
that are of interest.

and ex-Senator Morrow, joint secretar-
ies) is the direct descendant of the origi-
nal Communist Peace Council and this
year as a result of the Communist Party’s
sw'itch from a “hard” to “peaceful” line
and its reassumption of the role of cham-
pion of Peace and Democratic Rights, the
Moscow domination has become more
apparent. But so has anti-Moscow influ-
ence in the CND.
The Peace Committee has tended in
the past to look on the CND with amused
tolerance. However, the publicity the
CND captured recently with its “Spies
for Peace” stunt (see The Bulletin,
July 6), and the fact that the Trotskyites,
arch-enemies of orthodox Communism
but at the moment supporters of the
Chinese Communist Party, have been
working their way into leading positions
in the CND, have caused the Communist
Party to sit up and take notice.
At one recent Peace Conference held
at Thornleigh, NSW (June 14-16), attend-
ed by Mr R. Gould, secretary of Sydney
CND and lately suspended from the ALP,
the CND made a direct challenge for
leadership of the whole “Peace” move-
ment. The CND has continued its
attack, stepping up its activities and in-
creasing the size of its monthly news-
letter, “Sanity”, to 20 roneod pages.
“Sanity” has boasted among other things
that CND has increased membership 600
per cent. The CND also decided to have
some of its own contingents, marching
as a separate entity, in the Communist
Peace Committee’s Sydney radial march
of August 4.
The Communist Party has retaliated
with counter-infiltration tactics, and mem-
bers of its youth front, the Eureka Youth
League, are now joining the CND and
attempting a takeover from within. Al-
ready the Communists have gained some
measure of control in the Sydney Uni-
versity CND group.
To counter the appeal of the CND to
youth and at the same time to minimise
any divisions on Sunday, August 4, the
Eureka Youth League planned a coun-
ter-attraction for Saturday, August 3.
Called “Bombs for Peace,” it called for
a youth-driven cavalcade of old bombs
(cars).
POLITICS
Why the Cabinet
Met in Albury
“No decadent city”
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDENY
J. B. RENSHAW
No political motive?
A lbury is a city of two States, politi-
cally of New South Wales but linked
to Victoria by closer bonds than the
bridges on the southern side of the
town. For a start the city is within
the domain of Carlton and United and
the beer baron of Melbourne, Mr Fog-
arty. Then it is an Australian Rules town,
importing stars and trainers from Mel-
bourne. The bricks of Albury’s houses
tend more to the lighter ochre color of
southern bricks, giving it something of
the appearance of a Victorian town.
Most Australians would know this
provincial city only by its dreary rail-
way station. Russel Drysdale in an early
painting captured the stark desolation
of Albury station at night. It was across
the wasteland of Albury station last
week that the Cabinet Ministers of New
South Wales came burning with a zeal
for “de-centralisation.” That sacred
political word was put forward as the
reason for the Cabinet meeting at Al-
bury, the third country meeting in a
year.
While the Acting-Premier, Mr J. B.
Renshaw, solemnly affirmed that there
was no political motive in the visit,
it wasn’t hard to find some motives other
than “de-centralisation,” for the visit to
the traditional Libera] seat of Albury.
Dudley Gordon Padman, a quiet un-
spectacular member, has represented Al-
bury in the Legislative Assembly since
after the war. But with Mr Padman at 74
the rumors of his impending retirement
current in Albury could well have some
basis, even though he personally avoids
the question. He was a Mayor for many
years before entering Parliament and the
question being asked last week was how
far his majorities of up to 4000 over
the years had' contained a personal ele-
ment which could swing if he retired.
Labor men in New South Wales still
remembering their victory in Lismore
a few years ago when they took a blue-
ribbon Country Party seat see any coun-
try seat as vulnerable.
v The visit was a good piece of public
relations for the Cabinet. The local
leaders were flattered, some money was
distributed.
But seats are still won by candidates
and the miracle of Lismore, which lurks
in the mind of Labor politicians, was
made possible in large part by a very
good local candidate, whereas in Al-
bury it emerged during the Cabinet
visit that Labor has not the best of
candidates. The man who has lost at
the last two elections to Dudley Padman
is Bob White, a publican president of
the local branch of the Australian
Hotels Association, who is reputedly
one of the richest men in Albury. To
make matters more difficult he is being
blamed by drinkers for a recent decision
to put up the price of beer by one
penny a 7oz. glass.
The other factor in the political equa-
tion of Albury is the non-party Mayor,
Alderman Cleaver Bunton. Alderman
Bunton is a man of somewhat varied ac-

Alderman Bunton provided some light
relief for the Cabinet by his firm
statement that Alburv was not “a de-
cadent city”; he added a touch of
philosophy in claiming “we are all
creatures of the State” and of theology
in calling electricity “God-given ” He is
a candidate who could win Albury with
Party endorsement.
PUBLISHING
The Threat of the
Government Printers
A test case?
FROM A SYDENT CORRESPONDENT
DR C. RODERICK
Captured the contract
spectres are haunting the Austra-
A lian printers and publishers, more
than one of whom came through with a
loss over the last financial year: the
arrival of American publishers to work
over the all-important textbook market;
the threat of Hong Kong and Japanese
printers undercutting Australian printers
in the Australian market; but, above
all, the emergence of the State Gov-
ernment Printers as competitors with
private printers strong, even irresist-
ible competitors since they print at cost
—no profits, no losses.
Already the WA Government Printer
is printing textbooks, and it looked re-
cently as if the Queensland Printer was
entering the business until Dr Colin
Roderick of Angus & Robertson made a
dramatic flight to Brisbane to capture the
contract for Halstead Press.
But by far the biggest fight is the
decision over the new NSW “Science for
High School Students” textbook. In this
case not only are all Australian publishers
deprived of any share of the profits, since
the Nuclear Research Foundation is act-
ing as its own publisher and will take all
the royalties, but so are all private print-
ers since the contract has been given to
the NSW Government Printer.
The printers and publishers see this as
the thin end of the wedge—an end with a
war-head on it. So concerned are they
that it has even been suggested that they
would be willing to chip in and print the
book for nothing in order to put an end
to the Government Printer’s ambitions!
The fight first became public (see The
Bulletin, July 27) when Professor
Messel rejected an offer by Brisbane’s
Jacaranda Press, a subsidiary of the Mel-
bourne printer Wilke & Co. (printer of
“Time”, “Reader's Digest” and the tele-
phone book) to publish the book at 15s.
less than the Nuclear Foundation's price
of 655. He refused because he had
already contracted with the Govern-
ment Printer five months before,
after inviting private tenders, and be-
cause he wants the royalties to go to the
Nuclear Research Foundation, a non-
profit-making, publicly administered
educational body, not to a commercial
publisher. Royalties have been estimated
eventually to reach <£2 per copy, but
Professor Messel also points out that the
Foundation is running the risk: if it
does not sell the book it will still have
to pay the 32 writers, the artists, the
Government Printer, the production costs,
and bear all losses.
The parry and thrust between the
Foundation and the publishers continue
daily. The book trade now claims that
the Government Printer has not “a hope
in hell"’ of getting the book out in time
for the next school year; to which the
Foundation replies that the book is al-
ready printed—the Pilot Edition after
all has been out for three months, and
certainly less than 30 per cent will have
to be revised. (Rubbing salt into the
wound, it also points out that the Gov-
ernment Printer produced the 900-page
Pilot Edition in 10 weeks and how many
commercial printers could have done
that!) The publishers then come back
with the claim that even if the printing
is done in time, the Government Printer
cannot possibly bind over 100.000 copies
in time. But even if this is true, say the
Foundation’s supporters, he can sub-
contract for some of the binding. But
what if a commercial printer did sub-
contract for some of the binding and
deliberately was late in delivering the
goods. . . ! So it goes on.
Meanwhile Dr Colin Roderick of
Angus & Robertson has written a long
private letter to the Premier, in the course
of which he criticised the Nuclear Re-
search Foundation (“Impertinence!” say
the Foundation’s sympathisers) and the
Australian Book Publishers’ Association
has threatened to take its case to the
Opposition when the NSW Parliament
reassembles this month.
The debate must rest there for the
time being, Messel standing firm on the
right of the Foundation tc royalties and
the publishers and printers fighting for
their lives in a test case against the Gov-
ernment Printers —a threat given increas-
ed vitality by the possibility that the new
Sydney University Press will try to cut
its costs by giving some of its contracts
to the NSW Government Printer.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Labor’s New Negatives
OERHAPS, after all, the retiring
A ALP Federal Secretary, Mr
F. E. Chamberlain, was wise to ex-
clude the newspapermen by mak-
ing impossible conditions for their
attendance at the ALP’s Perth Con-
ference. As a result of no one’s
really having been able to study it,
the new defence policy adopted by
the Conference has had a far bet-
ter Press than it deserves. If there
is any advance in “realism” it is
indeed small.
How much, after all, does a nega-
tive resolution mean? “The ALP
does not believe that Australian
forces should be committed over-
seas except subject to a clear and
public treaty which accords with
the principles of a declaration
which gives Australia an effective
voice in the common decisions of
the treaty Powers.” Right - wing
Labor spokesmen and most Press
commentators have assumed that
this means that a Labor Govern-
ment would be in favor of joining
a Malayan defence treaty and, as a
corollary, that it would be willing
to station troops there. But this is
to read a lot between the lines.
The ALP is still bemused by the
United Nations and appears to re-
gard that organisation as the reposi-
tory of all wisdom and justice in
international affairs. What sort of
realism is it that does not recognise
that the UN is dominated by Pow-
ers whose views could conflict
sharply with our interests? Never-
theless, the Conference advocates a
regional defence pact of UN
States in South-East Asia and the
Indian sub-continent. It is safe
enough to imply that Australian
troops could be sent abroad in such
circumstances because a compre-
hensive regional pact of UN Pow-
ers is impossible, requiring, as it
does, that they should abandon the
neutralism and non-alignment that
have served them so well in terms
of help from both sides in the cold
war.
In any case, unless the Confer-
ence is misreported (and that would
be its own fault), there is a curious
phrase that needs explanation. This
is that “mobile voluntary defence
forces equipped with modern
weapons” would be formed to be
ready for any operations under the
UN regional pact. This would ap-
pear to mean that, as in the last
two wars, no one could be sent to
fight overseas who did not volun-
teer to do so.
The fact is that ALP thinking
about defence is still old-fashioned.
There is only an ambiguous accep-
tance of the fact that our defence
interests could require Australian
troops to fight overseas, as opposed
to making a last - ditch stand on
Australian soil, and there is still
the old faith in the citizen soldier.
The CMF are, of course, im-
portant under the Government’s
policy, but any idea that they are a
substitute for regular forces is non-
sense. A war at the modern pace
could be over before they were as-
sembled and embarked.
It is true that there are signs of
more advanced thinking in the
phrase about “modern weapons
with a range and strike power to
deter an aggressor”. But on in-
spection this turns out to be no
more than is to be expected under
existing policy. Labor promises
to order a bomber. So almost cer-
tainly will the Government as soon
as it has considered the report of
Air-Marshal Sir Valston Hancock’s
mission to inspect the types avail-
able overseas. For the Navy there
is no promise of the new aircraft-
carrier which would give it a strike
capacity.
The other contributions are the
abandonment of the nuclear deter-
rent in the Southern Hemisphere,
and the conversion of SEATO into
a cultural and technical alliance—
two pieces of folly which apparently
remain.
The Price of Unity
TTIERE is no concealing the gen-
A eral disappointment over the
latest revision of the list of books
banned by the Federal Customs
Department. A few books have
been released that should never
have 'been banned at all, such as
John O’Hara’s “Butterfield 8” and
Celine’s “Guignol’s Band”, but
Vance Bourjailly’s “The Confes-
sions of a Spent Youth”, Vladimir
Nabokov’s “Lolita”, the “Kama-
Sutra of Vatsyayana”, Henry Mil-
ler’s “Tropic of Cancer”, and
D. H. Lawrence’s “Lady Chatter-
ley’s Lover” remain banned. James
Baldwin’s “In Another Country”
has even been added to the list.
Since the latest revision was ob-
viously no more than a bureaucra-
tic tinkering with censorship and
not the occasion for further steps
ahead, it is now clear that we are
still in a prolonged period of “con-
solidation” after the liberal break-
through in 1957.
What has happened to the liber-
alism of 1957? There is no doubt
of the liberalism of the Minister,
Senator Henty; it seems clear from
his published statements that his
standards of book freedom are
equal to those in the United King-
dom and United States. As for the
Literature Censorship Board, one
knows it, too, is liberal in temper;
it released “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover”, for example, only to be
overruled by Federal Cabinet. So
one must assume that their enlight-
ened attitudes are checked by an
over-cautious fear of what the wow-
ser element of the public or a
chicken Cabinet will tolerate. It is
not so much a matter of liberalism
now; it is a matter of courage.
One other significant develop-
ment here is the annual censorship
conference between the Federal
Department of Customs and the
Attorneys-General of the States.
These unfortunately give the rep-
resentatives of Queensland and Vic-
toria the opportunity to put regu-
lar pressure on the Customs De-
partment. Some short-sighted “pro-
gressives” have always demanded
“unity” of censorship between the
States and Customs; they have got
it now. Let’s hope they enjoy it,
because opponents of censorship
certainly do not.

Bill McMahon
From “Christus Veritas ” to the Department of Labor
An Interview with PETER COLEMAN
P.C. Minister, did you go into politics
because of some major personal deci-
sion, or had you always assumed you
would go in?
W.M. It seemed natural. From my
earliest childhood I’d been immersed in
a political atmosphere. I think my only
clear memory of my father was when
he contested the Labor seat of Camper-
down for the Liberal Patty about 50
years ago. He was beaten by his own
articled clerk, Stewart Robertson.
P.C. Why was this your main mem-
ory?
W.M. My parents died when I was a
child and I was brought up by several
relatives, though mainly by Sir Samuel
Walder. He was Lord Mayor of Sydney
and one of the vice-presidents of the
UAP. I remember helping in his poli-
tical campaigns even when I was a
boy.
P.C. Did your interest in religion
take shape in those years?
W.M. Yes and no. My family was
divided over religion. My father’s family
was Catholic, though he was a rational-
ist. My mother’s family was Anglican.
There were religious differences between
some members of the family, though
Sir Samuel Walder was a very tolerant
Anglican. Religion hardly affected me
until I was about 16 or 17. I never
went to Sunday school for example. But
I was “twice-born”, as John Robertson
puts it, and I developed a keen interest
in dogmatic theology when I was 17. I
still am interested, though not with the
enthusiasm I had up to five or six years
ago when politics became too absorbing
and I just couldn’t find the time.
P.C. Which theologians influenced
you most?
W.M. I think William Temple. His
“Christus Veritas” and “Christ’s Revela-
tions of God” can be read and re-read.
Also Moss’s “The Christian Faith” and
Cyril Garbett’s “Church and State”.
But my reading has been pretty cosmo-
politan, including G. S. Lewis, J. B.
Phillips and lately John Robinson’s
“Honest to God”. My own view is that
religion is intensely personal and it’s
unwise to try and mix it with politics.
The dangers of insincerity and hypocrisy
are too real.
P.C. Are you a good churchman?
W.M. Not as good as I should be, but
I am a practising Christian.
P.C. After you left Sydney Grammar
you went to St Paul’s College where you
had a reputation of being one of the
wild students of the time. When you left,
for example, the College magazine
Pauline referred to your “fondness for
night-life” and your “clattering about
the corridors when you returned in the
small hours.” It also, incidentally, de-
scribed you as “cheerful, rowdy, extro-
vert” with “a swaggering gait, spluttering
utterance, grin from ear to ear, and a
nose that bore testimony to considerable
boxing experience.” It said you “would
talk volubly and hyperbolically on most
subjects, with or without any knowledge
of them”?
W.M. Well, that was 30 years ago.
But it’s true I have usually gone my own
way and am inclined to be iconoclastic.
Luckily I have been able to pursue my
interests as a student these included
ballet, theatre, music, art, as well as
some attention to my studies in law and
later economics. I’m supposed to be
awfully serious now. Many people have
expressed surprise at the so-called trans-
formation.
P.C. What about sport?
W.M. When I was younger I was very
keen on rowing and football. I rowed
for the Sydney Grammar eight and play-
ed halfback for the school. I raced a
couple of horses for a while and I did
a bit of skiing before the war. These
days I play mainly golf and squash.
P.C. How far did you take your
youthful artistic interests?
W.M. I kept up a real interest in
ballet for some years I suppose I was
a balletomane. But I didn’t build up
much of an art collection; after all I
live in a small flat I’m not married—
and where do you hang a collection?
But I’ve kept in touch.
P.C. What contemporary artists do
you like, or dislike?
W.M. For my sins I don’t understand
John Olsen—or for that matter Patrick
White and I’m no great admirer of
Sidney Nolan. But I admire the vitality
of Dickerson and Blackman, and in the
plastic arts, Tom Bass, Gerald Lewers
and Douglas Annand.
P.C. Did you keep up your interest in
music?
W.M. I keep a pretty comprehensive
library of music, but my interest fell
off. It’s returning now.
P.C. What composers?
W.M. Oh, Mozart, Brahms, Tchai-
kovsky, Verdi, Puccini. I used to be very
enthusiastic about Sibelius. I’m not now.

P.C. How would you compare the
cultural life of Sydney in the 1930 s
with now?
W.M. I think there was more cultural
vitality then, particularly in art, ballet
and music. I’m thinking of the orches-
tras and ballet companies we had the
tours by Malcolm Sargent, the Ballets
Russes de Monte Carlo. But something
of that vitality is returning now, parti-
cularly with the avant garde painters
following Dobell.
P.C. Where did politics fit into your
student activities?
W.M. Well, I kept them up. In any
case as a law student 1 was articled to
Allen, Allen and Hemsley which has
always been in the forefront in constitu-
tional and civil liberties cases. When I
was there they handled the Privy Coun-
cil case to stop Jack Lang abolishing
the NSW Upper House. Later they acted
in the Banking Case when Mr Chifley
tried to nationalise the banks. Arthur
Hemsley in particular and Norman
Cowper influenced my political thinking
at the time: they both have the sort of
generous liberalism that I admired.
P.C. Did any of your law teachers
influence you?
W.M. Yes, Sir John Peden who taught
me constitutional law. He seemed to me to
stress the duty of the lawyer to protect
the individual against the State. This
has been one of my fundamental politi-
cal beliefs.
P.C. Did any other teachers influence
you?
W.M. Not then. After the war I
returned to Sydney University to do
Economics and studied Public Adminis-
tration under Armand Bland whose
teachings jelled with those of Sir John
Peden’s. He revived my interest in
liberal philosophies, after five years in
the Army. I was particularly impressed
by his views on free men and free insti-
tutions. I’m an ardent supporter of free
enterprise, and the foundation of this
is free banking.
P.C. What were your war years like?
W.M. I can’t be pretentious about
them. I was in for 53 years, mainly in
a staff job. I suffered from a slight deaf-
ness then it's since been cured and
that made it difficult for me to com-
mand troops in a battle line. But getting
back to intellectual influences I don't
want to exaggerate the influence of any
particular individuals on my thinking.
There have been no great crises in my
intellectual life and my ideas have really
been absorbed from the liberal move-
ment rather than from any outstanding
teachers.
P.C. When did you decide to stand
for Parliament?
W.M. It just happened really. I’d been
more or less immersed in politics for
some time and during the war when I
was in the Army I was invited to con-
test a seat for the Liberal Party in
1943. I came down to Sydney but the
notice was too short and I didn’t relish
standing for pre-selection against the sit-
ting Liberal Member. I spent about 18
months in America and Europe refresh-
ing myself mainly interesting myself
in political trends there.
P.C. Was this your first trip?
W.M. No. I'd been overseas two or
three times before the war. On this trip
I was particularly interested in the
future of Democracy and the threat of
Communism. 1 have always been interest-
ed in Marxism as you can see from my
bookshelves. Then back home I did the
four-year Economics course in two years
and stood for Lowe in 1949.
P.C. It was a Labor seat then?
W.M. Yes. It was a redistributed seat.
On the figures I had to win 600 votes
and of course redistribution hasn’t
favored me since then. It’s probably
the most mixed electorate in Australia
with a range of suburbs from staunchly
Liberal Strathfield to strongly Labor
Mortlake. We have won with increased
majorities each election up to 1958.
P.C. Your present portfolio is Labor
and National Service. It must be a com-
pletely different proposition from your
earlier portfolios Navy and Air Force,
Social Services and Primary Industry.
W.M. Yes it is. I liked those port-
folios and naturally I was pleased with
many of the policies we pushed through
reconstructing the RAAF on Com-
mand lines, liberalising the means test,
getting the new Department of Primary
Industry going, the five-year wheat agree-
ment and so on. But they were not really
complex in the same way the Labor port-
folio is. The politics were different. You
could decide on a policy and carry it
through, and you had the satisfaction of
knowing you had done something to help
someone, particularly in Social Services.
There was not the wide and almost in-
evitable conflict of interests and of per-
sonalities that you have to deal with in
Labor and National Service. Its work
is intensely personal and can quickly be-
come political. It's oriented to the ACTU
point of view and I think it should be.
After all you're dealing with industrial
groups and individuals and with con-
stantly changing situations. The impact
of what you do can have nationwide
repercussions and affect our prospects in
a way that is incomparable to what is
done in other Departments.
P.C. You inherited the portfolio from
Mr Holt in 1959 when unemployment was
becoming a serious issue for the first
time. This obviously made your work
much harder.
W.M. Yes. You can be sure of that:
it did. Lately the waterfront has been my
biggest problem. Conditions changed so
much with the death of Jim Healy, and
with the loss of Joe Hewitt, Chairman of
the Stevedoring Industry Authority. We
have had plenty of problems and you
could never be sure you were right.
P.C. Do you think you'll get lasting
peace on the waterfront while the Com-
munists still control the watersiders?
W.M. It will be difficult as the Com-
munists have a different scale of values
and morality to ours. As you know a
working party has been looking at the
problems of the waterfront and I have
no wish to be provocative before its
report is fully examined. But the long-
service leave legislation has been a
major achievement. It has had a
stabilising influence, particularly since we
removed the penalties which were often
used to justify stoppages and in any case

were, for the older men, like a red rag to
a bull.
P.C. Speaking generally, do you be-
lieve your Department should intervene
in all labor questions?
W.M. Definitely not. We should watch
everything but not try to do everything.
We should intervene only when the pub-
lic interest is involved and then we should
do it precisely, as on the waterfront. The
Government as a government should not
be too intrusive: politics ought to be kept
out. If possible problems ought to be
settled by the unions and the employers,
the Arbitration Commission, the Public
Service Board, the Stevedoring Industry
Authority and so on. These authorities
should be, and be known to be, inde-
pendent.
P.C. Does that mean that you oppose
the idea of the Government working out
a definite wages policy so that you can
tell the Arbitration Commission precise-
ly how much you think workers should
be paid instead of simply summarising
the economic situation?
W.M. Yes. We haven't got the consti-
tutional power for a “wages policy”, and
there’s lots of loose talk about this.
There’s no point in having a wages policy
unless you have a total incomes policy,
unless you can also say what all personal
incomes or company profits should be;
and you can’t do that without something
like total controls. Even if we tried to
do it in a liberal way, a Labor Govern-
ment, following our precedent, would
do it in a very different way. At the
moment we give the Arbitration Com-
mission our view of the state of the
economy and our ideas on major prin-
ciples, and leave it to them to decide.
I am opposed to excessive intervention
by the Department or the Government.
P.C. Won’t the proposed Restrictive
Practices Tribunal raise special prob-
lems for your Department? After all
dargs, restrictions on output, are restric-
tive practices.
W.M. No. The proposals do not apply
to industrial relations and awards.
P.C. Do you feel your Department
should have more say in labor questions
in New Guinea, instead of leaving it all
to the Department of Territories?
W.M. No. The authorities in New
Guinea should be responsible for mak-
ing these decisions. We don't know
enough about the special conditions that
exist there and New Guinea is outside
the scope of my portfolio. In any case
Mr Hasluck is very punctilious about
getting our advice if he thinks it can
be of help.

P.C. But do you think, for example,
that Australian-style compulsory arbi-
tration would work there?
W.M. This is really out of my field.
Each country has its own special prob-
lems and has to develop those institu-
tions best suited to its needs. This is a
decision for the Minister for Territories
to make. He knows the facts and the
psychology much better than I do.
P.C. You’ve been very active in the
International Labor Organisation which
has recently excluded South Africa from
all ILO meetings except the annual con-
ference, because of apartheid. You also
have major interests in international is-
sues such as Communism, and you were
once Acting Minister for Territories. Do
your ambitions include getting the Min-
istry of External Affairs?
W.M. It is a fascinating portfolio but
I have enough on my hands at the
moment and I don’t believe in letting
my imagination run riot or even to stray
to the pleasant but presently unattainable
things in life, either in foreign affairs or
anywhere else.
P.C. Turning to the Liberal Party
generally, you were Chairman of the
Liberal Party Policy Research Commit-
tee for some years and one of those who
rewrote the party platform a couple of
years ago. Do you think that the Party’s
official commitment to federalism is
outdated?
W.M. I am a believer in federalism,
but there is no point in ignoring a
general weakening of the will for feder-
alism in Australia. And there are some
areas where the Commonwealth should
have additional power. I think, for ex-
ample, that the Commonwealth should
have more power over interest rates and
should try to co-ordinate the State’s
arbitration and conciliation powers
including power over wages and con-
ditions of employment. A change to
avoid deadlocks between the Senate and
the House of Representatives is also
desirable, and I think we should have
some amendment to the Constitution to
permit an increase in the size of the
House of Representatives without in-
creasing the number of Senators.
P.C. Do you still oppose any kind of
economic planning?
W.M. As I said I’m against controls
unless you can prove a good case for
them. There is scope for increased Com-
monwealth planning without physical
controls. Housing and education, for
example, are two of the bees in my
bonnet. I foresee increasing Federal ac-
tion here. We are doing an enormous
amount and too little is known about
what is being done. We have already
made the break-through in education,
particularly in university education, and
the Universities Commission is looking
at the whole field of tertiary education.
P.C. What about our relations with
America and Britain?
W.M. We should foster closer links
with America being and demonstrat-
ing to the world that we are friends.
Americans and Australians think alike,
act alike, and our principles are at
heart the same. Naturally we should
also retain our links with the United
Kingdom but it would be a brave man
who would not forecast a weakening
of our traditional ties.
P.C. If and when Sir Robert Menzies
retires, do you see the Liberal Party
taking a new direction?
W.M. No, not on principles. As I
said, with new personalities the emphasis
must change and I suppose there will be
some changes in direction and an in-
creasing activity by the Commonwealth
Government in fields where we’ve for-
merly had little or no responsibility;
that’s inevitable. The secret of success
for any liberal-minded person is an
avid reception of new ideas and a will to
put them into practice.
P.C. You are not a conservative then?
W.M. Definitely not. I have few idols.

Dear Little Pets
Dogs’ dinners are big business
By SHEILA PATRICK
madam,” the shopkeeper said.
K “Kitty Salmon is for cats”. “I
don’t care, my dog loves it,” the
well-dressed, elderly dog owner said. “I
don’t let him see the tin, so he doesn’t
know”.
The pet-shop proprietor shrugged and
wrapped up the cat food.
Makers and retailers of pet foods
agree that there are not only more dogs
and cats about these days, but that their
owners, who once used to sling them a
hunk of meat and a plain biscuit, have
taken to giving them specially prepared
dog-and-cat foods and fancy English
medicines. Many owners are feeding
their pets expensive baby food. Dogs are
becoming as faddy about their food as
their owners are.
Mr Bill Bray, who has run the Pets’
Pantry, Mosman, Sydney, for nearly 20
years, said that in 1943 when he started
his shop, he only sold horse meat, one
kind of dog biscuit and a few dog med-
icines.
“I opened up towards the end of the
war”, he said, “when people used to
queue for horse meat. I was the only shop
between here and Palm Beach. Now there
are so many varieties of pet foods I can’t
stock them all. And I would guess there
are 20 pet-food shops between Mosman
and Palm Beach today”.
With horse meat at 2/6 lb. for fillet,
2/2 for steak and 2/- chopped scraps,
kangaroo 1/10 and butchers’ beef be-
tween 2/- and 3/- for chopped bits, the
nourishing dry meals at 1/6 lb. are be-
coming increasingly popular both with
owners and their pets.
Five years ago there were eight manu-
facturers of dry dog foods in Australia.
Now there are 15, all with greatly in-
creased turnovers.
Brawn sausages and liver is also on
sale for pets at 1/6 lb. Cats are catered
for with tinned fish dinners, the most
popular being Kitty Salmon from the US
at 1/9 a 6 oz. tin.
Mr Bray said that tinned pet foods
were not as nourishing as the fresh meat,
but much cheaper. A popular brand
retails at 1/3 a 15 oz. tin. Chain stores
sell it for less. There are also dehydrated
dog foods made from meat bits and other
ingredients at 1/6 lb. and other brands.
The variety and range of dry pet
foods has increased more than 100%
over the past five years, and there is a
small but growing export market develop-
ing. There are at least 20 varieties of
dog biscuits on the market today. They
come in flavors such as meat, charcoal,
fish, wheatmeal. Some are shaped like
bones
A leading dog-biscuit maker, who turns
out some 12 varieties of dog foods, said
they make biscuits for every age. There
is the Teeny-Weaner for the puppy which
is being weaned. This is mixed with milk
into a mush. Puppy Crunch is for the
dog over three months and then they go
on to Ken-L meal.
“Many owners like to give their dogs
different kinds of dog biscuits in the
mornings to exercise their gums and
teeth”, he said. “And there are the lollies
of the dog world, Munchies, which are
extra and given as a reward for tricks
and good behavior”. His firm also makes
bird seed, cat food and fish meal.
“All our products are tested at the
Veterinary School, Sydney University,”
he said. “And we are doing so well we are
opening up good export markets in the
Far East, New Guinea, Fiji and Malaya.”
Sydney’s largest horse meat suppliers
say they are selling less horse and kanga-
roo meat today than previously. “Not
only is it often hard to get,” he said,
“but the price cannot compare favorably
with the dry foods. Horse meat was
popular when it was Is. a lb. That was
the main attraction of it.”
A well-known breeder said that the
idea of faddy foods often comes from
amateur breeders who were giving pups
Farex, Pentavite, egg yolk and tinned
baby food. “These amateurs get hold of
a good bitch and think they can make
a lot of money because they hear that
a well-bred pup can fetch up to £50,”
she said.
She said that by the time these ama-
teurs pay the service fee, and vets’ fees
and lose half the litter through inexperi-
ence, they are, more than not, down on
the deal. “Not only has the price of
pedigree pups fallen from an average
of £2O to about £B,” she said, “but
these people give out typewritten diet
charts which are all wrong. They even
advocate finely chopped fillet steak.”
Another Sydney pet-shop owner said
that fashions both in food and breed
change with pets all the time. “For in-
stance, TV and radio can bring a fad
for a certain breed,” he said. “The Jackie
Gleason show had a basset hound in it,
and this breed, which hasn’t been around
for years, suddenly becomes popular.”
“It is also difficult to predict what will
be popular with pet foods and medicines.
Advertising doesn’t always do the trick.
Word of mouth at dog shows, and breed-
ers telling their customers what to give
their animals, is often the best way.”
He said, for instance, some time ago
the makers of a vitamin supplement for
a skin complaint in dogs put out a
very handsome advertising booklet, pro-
moting their product. This booklet was
rather technical, and in it they men-
tioned in passing that while handling
the dog with the skin complaint, the
owner should wash his hands in Phiso-
hex, which medical people know well
as an antiseptic. “I sold hardly any of
the vitamin supplement but the sales
of Phisohex soared,” he said. “Dog
owners, for reasons known only to them-
selves, were washing their animals in
Phisohex to cure the complaint. See
what I mean?”
He said another craze was for skin
and blood pills, and for kidney and
bladder pills. “Suddenly the fashion for
these pills changed,” he said. “We
hardly sell any today.”
The very latest in dog medicines in
Australia is English herbal medicines. A
number of English breeders and show
judges have been coming to Australia
during the past few years and apparently
brought the idea with them. There is
a whole shelf of these herbal remedies
couch grass, iodine, treebark, wheat
germ, leaf plasma, seaweed and garlic
tablets.
There are Birth Aid tablets for the
bitch having difficulty in whelp, and


for the dog off his tucker there is Royal
Relish at 4s. 9d. a 4oz. tin. This is
smeared over his evening meal.
Shampoos retail at as much as 16s. 6d.
a bottle and most pet food shops stock
dogs’ clothing and accessories. Nylon-
lined with flannel, coats are 305., and
quilted red velvet or suede jackets are
£2 12s. 6d. Silver and blue lame, pre-
sumably for evening wear, is £3 7s. Od.
A tiny sailor jacket, bright blue with a
red-and-white striped collar and a hand-
kerchief to match in the pocket, was
small enough for a chihuahua and cost
495. 6d. Naval and military coats with
badges and brass buttons were £3 3s. Od.
Comfortable wicker baskets were sel-
ling from 395. 6d. to £6 and collars,
ranging from a plain silvered chain at
6s. 6d. up to studded leather with beads
at £4 and real gems up to £4O. A
bath at the local bath club costs from
15s. 6d. to 18s. 6d. according to the
size and dirtiness of the dog. Shampoo-
ing and nail clipping is included.
The bird and fish story is a very dif-
ferent one from dogs and cats. “TV
has stonkered the fish business,” Mr
Bray said. “In the old days, folks seemed
to listen to the radio and play with
their birds and fish. Today, they sit
looking at TV and when the birds and
fish all die, they don’t replace them.”
“We used to have a big fish business,
two rooms filled with tanks, and two
rooms filled with birds. Only three or
four years ago, people would pay up
to £5O for a pair of fancy finches.
African Weaver birds too could fetch
up to £5O a pair. Budgies were popular
and £l2 was not uncommon for a
good pair.
“We still sell a few birds, and quite
a bit of bird seed, but even pigeons,
parrots and canaries have gone off in
popularity. Children don’t seem to keep
birds and fish much now either.
“Still, I’ve noticed a slight increase
in the fish market lately. Perhaps they
are getting used to TV and hankering
after a few fish to watch again. I hope
so.”
Disneyland-on-the-Clarence
Something tropical , lush and mid-Victorian
By PETER GREEN
Artist Donald Friend has always
had an enormous love for every-
thing that is lush, tropical and
exotic. He has also a love for Victoriana
and Edwardiana. Seeing that all these
things are to be found in North Queens-
land in large measure, he painted them
very beautifully.
When I found him then he was with
Margaret Olley. They were painting an
enormous mural in the best Taubmans
enamels around the walls of Brisbane's
Lennon’s Hotel. The theme was as tropi-
cal, lush and as mid-Victorian as all
hell.
There were ladies in peacock chairs,
ladies chasing butterflies, absurd Queens-
land houses and, of course, a great
illustration depicting the national diet
of goat and galah.
At one time, Friend went off to ex-
ploit another lush, tropical area. He
stayed in Ceylon for five years but he
has settled once again in Sydney. Now
he is on to a theme right down his
bridle path, so to speak.
Baillieu Myer, second son of the late
Sidney Myer, commissioned Friend to
do a series on Yullgilbar castle. The
show opens at Brisbane’s Johnstone Gal-
lery this week. You must have heard of
Yullgilbar Towers. It's like something out
of Grimm’s fairytales or Disneyland at
the very least. There was never any-
thing quite like it in this country.
Baillieu Myer commissioned the pic-
tures to celebrate Yullgilbar’s 100th an-
niversary. The castle, Moorish, so we’re
told, is on a cattle property in a bend
of the Clarence River, 40 miles north-
west of Grafton. Mrs Baillieu Myer in-
herited it from her father, the late Sam
Hordern.
Well, Donald Friend’s pictures,
painted on gold leaf he’s always
adored gold leaf tell the whole story.
Edward David Stuart Ogilvie and his
brother Frederick, sons of a Royal Navy
lieutenant who served under Nelson,
came out here in 1840, explored the
northern rivers and took up 200,000
acres of land. There was a trial of
strength, spear-throwing, wrestling, run-
ning against the Yullgilbar natives to
form an Ogilvie-Yullgilbar non-aggres-
sion pact. The bouts are depicted in
Friendian style on gold leaf. The Ogil-
vies prospered and in May, 1860, Ed-
ward started to build his castle. He
wanted something that would stand for-
ever as the family seat of an hereditary
colonial aristocracy.
The building he put up was enormous.
It was three storeys high with 40 rooms.
The main wing was 91ft long by 85ft
deep and there were two battlemented
towers 40ft and 50ft high, fit to hold
off the hordes of Genghis Khan. Ogilvie
imported workmen from Germany. He
baked 110,000 bricks. He worked a
quarry for 1000 tons of freestone. There
was a lovely inner courtyard 40ft square
surrounded by cedar balconies. There
were canvas awnings, palm trees, a cen-
tral fountain.
Naturally, there was a separate wing
for the footmen, butler, kitchen staff and
stuff. Legend has it that Ogilvie dressed
the aborigines in liveried uniform com-
plete with powdered wigs. Donald
Friend has made extensive investiga-
tions but he has been unable to find any
proof of this. However, nobody would
want a good legend like that to go to
waste so he has painted a delicious pic-
ture titled “Yullgilbar butler’s day off.”
And there’s the poor fellow visiting the
humpy in his wig, stockings and all with
his mates looking on sore amazed.
What else? There was a marvellous
landscaped garden. A long drive swept
up to the gates, guarded by stone lions.
There was a croquet lawn, a boat house
and the tennis court had net posts with
the tops carved into miniature battle-
ments matching those of the turrets
behind.
Things were done very nicely at Yull-
gilbar. Spare suits of tails were kept
for guests who arrived without correct
dress for dinner. Friend depicts all this
good life. One picture which pleases
me shows a very genteel Miss Jessica
Ogilvie with her grey pony. Miss Jessica
is holding a red book and, if you look
carefully, hell's bells, it's titled “Karl
Marx.”
Not long after the turn of the cen-
tury Yullgilbar changed hands and it
became too expensive to maintain. After
the 'thirties it was even unoccupied and
it was easier to live in the station home-
stead nearby. So now, nice, old Yull-
gilbar Towers has collapsed beyond re-
storation and the Spanish courtyard is
overgrown. Vandals have ripped up the
marble paving and at least 2000 people
have embellished the place with their
interesting autographs. It has been re-
ported, too, that a great Moreton Bay
fig is slowly overwhelming the turreted
thick walls.
Yullgilbar is not all in this exhibition.
Half a dozen Ned Kelly pictures have
been snuck in. These clearly are Friend’s
friendly blockbusters aimed directly at
Sid Nolan. There’s a picture which
shows Ned leaning against the door of
the shack. He’s holding a rifle and wear-
ing that perfectly rectangular, black
Nolan-Kelly helmet. Inside, Kate Kelly,
looking utterly delightful in pink crino-
line and long white frilly panties, is
serving tea. She holds out a cup to-

wards Kelly and the title of the picture
is “Two Lumps, Edward?”
Furthermore, the walls of the. shack
are decorated with some nice, but fiend-
ish, Leda and the Swan pictures. There
are several pictures ot the Kellys having
their family portrait taken. Edward,
arms akimbo, stands in the middle, nat-
urally in his helmet, over the door you
can read “S. Nolan, Licensee. Crowds
and Scenic Effects.” Look through the
door and you see Tucker’s PVA Hotel.
PVA undoubtedly stands for poly vinyl
acetate and the symbolism would appear
to be that where you find Nolan, Mr
Tucker is not far behind.
A good exhibition; as Cole Porter
might have said: “Yullgilbar is truly
wunderbar.”
The Reluctant “Playboy”
A ban on brogue
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Irishman Mr Joe McColum was
brought very reluctantly to “The
Playboy of the Western World” which
he has just successfully produced for
the Old Tote Theatre, Kensington,
Sydney, making the fourth • and final
success of the theatre’s first season. “I
felt that otherwise I would be made to
do ‘Juno and the Paycock’ and that w'as
not to be borne,” he said.
Although he came originally to the
National Institute of Dramatic Art 18
months ago wfith the prestige of Dublin’s
Abbey Theatre behind him, Mr Mc-
Colum is fighting against being con-
sidered a producer of Irish plays. But
he admitted he has, with possible future
production in mind, looked at “Stephen
D.,” based on Joyce’s “Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man,” and looked at
“Bloomsday,” an adaptation of part of
“Ulysses” and rejected it as “too
strong” for Australian audiences.
Mr McColum said that he had had
no intention of doing “The Playboy”
with Irish accents, although, actors
being what they were, there now seemed
to be strong traces of stage Irish in
their voices. “What you call brogue,”
he said disparagingly. Early in re-
hearsals he had scored the whole play.
In this way he felt he had achieved a
fairly uniform rhythm of speech, which
seemed to him the main thing. There
are no Irish people in the cast. “I was
afraid to have any,” he said. “One
Irish accent would show up the rest of
the players.” Only about four words—
all Gaelic had been changed in the
dialogue.
Since his Abbey Theatre days, during
which he met Hugh Hunt, a meeting
which indirectly led to his coming here,
Mr McColum has worked in the theatre
in Israel and Czechoslovakia. The
Abbey these days, he said, was a
mausoleum, a prestige activity to
attract tourists, rather than a living
theatre.
“There are still plenty of playwrights
in Ireland, writing plays, mostly cottage
comedies, in the Abbey tradition,” he
said. “They are always funny, and done
in the Abbey way of underacting they
are very effective entertainment. But
these writers are not saying anything
new.”
Mr McColum said that “The Play-
boy of the Western World” was never
played while he was at the Abbey. “I
think it would be unlikely that it would
be done even now, ‘in case it might
offend someone’,” he said. “Synge’s
‘The Tinker’s Wedding’ was banned
because there was a scene in which a
priest was trussed in a sack.” (Students'
of change in language might be in-
terested to know that the violent protests
and riots following the original produc-
tion of the play at the Abbey were set
off by a line in the third act referring
to “maidens in shifts.”)
Mr McColum said the Abbey had only
a small subsidy, but the subsidy, which
began in the ’twenties, was the start of
its decline. “A director was appointed
who was a fanatic for the revival of
Gaelic,” he said. “When he couldn’t
teach actors Gaelic, he tried getting
Gaelic - speaking people and teaching
them to act. I remember one time an
actress dried up and, ad-libbing, walked
across to the prompt corner. Nothing
came from there, so she picked up a
cue and carried on. Later it was found
that the girl holding the book could
speak English but couldn’t read it.”
After six years in the theatre in
London, Mr McColum went to Israel
in 1950 and stayed there two years. His
job there became producing plays at
the kibbutzim. He did about 20 pro-
ductions, including Shaw, Shakespeare
and plays by young Israeli writers.
Most of these, Mr McColum said,
were based on Jewish history. “You
know, the Maccabees, and so on,” he
said. “I did one play at a fishing kib-
butz in Caesarea, in the open air, and
set in Caesarea in Biblical times. It
was very thrilling.”
Mr McColum said he lound some-
thing of the enthusiasm among his Aus-
tralian students that he had found
among young people in Israel. “There
is a feeling here of new beginnings,” he
said. “You can make terrible mistakes
in the theatre in London but it doesn’t
show. But everyone who puts a finger
into the theatre here will leave a mark.”
Mr McColum seems determined to
see w'hat mark he can leave. In his 18
months here he has acquired an Aus-
tralian wife and a firm determination
to live and work in the theatre here, but
not, he hopes, as a stage Irishman.


OVERSEAS
America’s Image of Britain
Watching Britain’s performance and being unimpressed
From GODFREY HODGSON in Washington
Many US newspapers featured on
their front pages a week or two
ago a delightful photograph. It
showed President Kennedy playing golf
in the informality of Cape Cod with
three of his intimates: his brother Teddy,
his brother-in-law Steve Smith and
British Ambassador Sir David Ormsby-
Gore.
The day before a weekly magazine
showed on its cover a big colour shot of
the White House dwarfed by a huge
Union Jack. Inside, a light-hearted article
addressed itself to the question: “Are we
becoming too British?” and decided in
a jocularly shocked tone that “more and
more Americans are dressing like
Englishmen, living like Englishmen,
drinking like Englishmen, behaving like
Englishmen and worst of all wish-
ing they were Englishmen.”
In view of this one might suppose
that the touchiest Briton this week could
look upon his country’s diplomatic re-
lationship and cultural image in
Washington and find them good. Any
such supposition would be sadly wrong.
Many kinds of news from Britain in the
last few weeks have shaken Americans:
reports, prominently featured here, of the
demonstrations against the Queen during
the Greek royal visit simply made
Americans think that Britain had gone
off its head.
It is true that, politically, the “special
relationship” between Britain and the
US is not the hollow mockery that
General de Gaulle and the British Labor
Party like to suggest. It is true, too, that
Mr Macmillan keeps in close touch with
the President, and that there is effective
daily co-operation between Britain and
America on a dozen problems around
the world.
But it is also true that the President
is sufficiently perturbed by the series of
storms in Anglo-US relations to have sent
one of his most valued personal advisers,
a man who could have held high office
in his Administration but refused it, on
a discreet mission to London. His brief
is to find what went wrong between the
two Governments from the moment the
cancellation of Skybolt became inevit-
able.
It will be a long list. There have not
only been many policy disagreements;
that is inevitable and normal. There have
also been mutual suspicions of bad faith.
There was the Skybolt issue. American
officials believe, and tell reporters, that
the British Government knew that Sky-
bolt was dead, and deliberately faked
surprise in order to extort Polaris in
return. On the British side there is
the feeling that Britain gave up her own
missile programme, not as is so often
said because it was too expensive, but
on US urging and because it made better
sense for the alliance, and that the Ad-
ministration tried to use Skybolt to ease
Britain out of the nuclear club.
There has been constant friction be-
tween the Pentagon and Britain’s Minis-
try of Defence on the question of the
conventional strength of Nato, with
US officials accusing Britain of using an
untenable strategic theory as a pretext
for not spending more, and British
officials claiming to be bewildered by the
changes of doctrine in the Pentagon as
well as admitting in unguarded moments
to be almost as annoyed by the Penta-
gon’s style as Congress is.
There have been subdued recrimina-
tions about the multilateral force. Here
the Americans believe that Britain has
backed down on a commitment; the
British that the Americans have been
squeezing, and using some pretty dubious
tactics, to achieve a scarcely-avowed
political end to surround General de
Gaulle.
There has been bad feeling about
joint Anglo-US aid to fndia. More im-
portant, there has been the constant sug-
gestion here, both from officials and in
the newspapers, that Britain’s whole ap-
proach to East-West relations has been
motivated mainly by the Conservative
Government’s political interests. “The
Prime Minister desperately needs a diver-
sion ... to rescue the sagged fortunes
of his Conservative Party.” That laconic
imputation, from the chief London cor-
respondent of a major US newspaper,
sums up the sort of interpretation of
British motives on the test ban issue that
US officials have been putting out and
US reporters have been faithfully re-
cording.
Finally, there has been the ugly little
business of the British security scandals,
with reports on both sides of the Atlan-
tic that American officials have been
planting stories about the unreliability of
British Intelligence in order to renege on
the Nassau agreement to sell Britain
Polaris. It is significant that, although
the Administration has made it plain
that Britain would pay not only the full
production price but also a share of
research and development which the
Americans have to do anyway for the
A-3 Polaris, the word used here is always
“give” not “sell”.
It is, in fact, almost unthinkable that
senior US officials have in fact done such
a thing with such motives. I do not
believe, after careful checking, that they
did so. But the unfortunate and in-
escapable thing is that it is not quite
unthinkable: not after the series of inci-
dents between this Administration and
Mr Diefenbaker’s Canadian Administra-
tion; not after the President’s telecast on
the eve of the Nassau conference; not
after some of the evasions and half-truths
to which British official spokesmen have
had recourse on vital Anglo-US ques-
tions. This is the measure of what has
gone wrong.
Of course, these signs of US im-

patience with Britain and British sen-
sitivity towards America are simply the
surface manifestations of changed ratios
of power. Nothing if not realistic, the
able, confident men around the President
have watched Britain's performance in
the world for two years and they are
unimpressed. This is not simply a ques-
tion of Governmental incompetence
though there was a feeling here that the
Macmillan Government does not take its
responsibilities seriously enough, even
before the Profumo affair confirmed it.
It is also a question of economic power
and performance, of social cohesion, of
the widespread belief in America that
a nation should have a will to power,
and that Britain does not now have such
a will.
No doubt many of the estimates cur-
rent here of Britain’s problems are false
or exaggerated. There is a tendency here
to argue, for example, that X million
Germans producing Y,OOO million dol-
lars per annum is proof of “assertive self-
confidence”, whereas an almost identical
number of Britons with an almost iden-
tical output is living evidence of deca-
dence and sloth.
US newspapers splashed the demon-
stration of the unemployed outside the
Houses of Parliament this spring, when
unemployment in Britain was half the
US average, and the same newspapers
did not find space to mention months of
rioting and disorder in the Appalachian
coalfields, where unemployment is three
to four times higher than in the blackest
spots in Britain.
Time Magazine recently featured a
big article on Britain, in which Britannia
was portrayed sinking into the waves.
The article described the “surly shop-
keepers, sleezy architecture, lunatic
liquor licensing laws” in Britain: an
Englishman m the US was left staggered,
wondering whether the writer had ever
bought anything in New York City, tried
to get a drink anywhere south of the
Mason-Dixon Line, or opened his eyes
in Los Angeles.
And so one could go on. But the im-
portant thing is £us image is actually
held. The American people are receiving
too much confirmation at the moment
of their two-centuries-old suspicion that
the British, who tend in any case to be
identified here with the Anglophile snobs
of Long Island, are finished. Their
pragmatic leaders, paraphrasing Stalin,
and asking: “How many divisions does
Britain have?” know the answer
“only two, and not so well equipped as
they ought to be.” (ofns.)
Barry Goldwater—Some
Are Taking Him Seriously
Fewer obstacles on the road to “this President thing?”
From MURRAY KEMPTQN in New York
June found the supporters of Barry
M. Goldwater a sect; it seems to
have made them the dominant
faction in the Republican Party.
The Senator from Arizona once set
down what then seemed to him the
“ideal” platform for a candidate for
President of the United States:
“I do not undertake to promote wel-
fare, for I propose to extend freedom.
My aim is not to pass laws but to
repeal them. It is not to inaugurate
new laws but to cancel old ones that do
violence to the Constitution or that have
failed their purpose or that impose on
the people an unwarranted financial
burden.”
He is proud, then, to announce him-
self the candidate of all those Re-
publicans whose consuming purpose is
vengeance on Franklin D. Roosevelt.
This is an amateur aspiration; the
dream of repealing history is not one
for which professional politicians have
much time. They are grateful to Barry
Goldwater for stirring the troops and
they are just as grateful because, until
now, he has shown so little disposition
to lead them.
They assumed that Goldwater would
come to the Republican Convention the
only candidate with any claim to the
devotion of ordinary delegates he
always does — and that he would exer-
cise that claim by delivering his follow-
ers —he always does —to whatever
disguised agent of Wall Street and the
New Deal the professionals chose as
their nominee.
For they cherish Barry Goldwater
peculiarly because he can be trusted to
surrender the way a professional sur-
renders and from the desire to serve
more than from the hope to gain, since
the impulse of self-sacrifice acts upon
him as the impulse of self-preservation
acts upon ordinary men. He speaks for
the unreconciled; yet no man in our
public life is easier to reconcile; his
partisans are conspicuous for rancour
and his person for its absence. To be
a Goldwaterite is ordinarily to oppress
every detached observer with how
seriously you take yourself; yet Barry
Goldwater does not seem to take him-
self seriously at all. One of the most
sophisticated of his partisans once said

that, when he first met Goldwater, he
thought him the stupidist man he had
ever seen. The Senator would be the
last to dispute this judgment; he has
too much respect for the intellect to
imagine that anyone so humble as him-
self could possess one. Show him a
doctor of philosophy who composed a
high-school study of Adam Smith and
he is on his knees to Edmund Burke.
A journalist suddenly aware of the
need to take him seriously spent a day
with Barry Goldwater a few weeks ago.
At its end, the old interior laughter was
too strong, and this visitor said: “You
know, Barry, this is a very complicated
world and the President of the United
States has immense problems. A lot of
people are not quite sure you have the
brains for the job. Do you think you
do?”
“When you put it that way,” Gold-
water answered, “I wonder.”
Yet less and less does there appear
to be any lion in his path to what he
calls “this President thing” except the
enormous presence of John F. Kennedy
himself. Barry Goldwater’s handicap
has always been that he thinks precisely
the way an ordinary delegate to the
Republican Convention thinks. But
ordinarily national convention delegates
are wise enough to save the country
from themselves; they seldom permit
themselves to nominate one of their
very own. But no alternative is visible.
Governor Rockefeller is still immobile
from the shock of discovering that, even
in this century, it is possible to sacrifice
all for love; and the position of the
Eastern progressives he represents is too
delicate for them to offer any automatic
substitute. The centre of Republican
passion and capital is shifting to the
South and the West; the party is really
strong only where the population is un-
corrupted by bookstores.
The South and West had been re-
signed to Rockefeller; yet the outrage
produced by his remarriage is evidence
of how many Republicans were desper-
ate to find some excuse for disliking
him except their ancient grudge against
the East, the international bankers and
the liberal Establishment. Every pro-
fessional argument against Goldwater
seems to them an argument for the true
faith he represents; the Senator’s image
is so alien to Eastern moderates as to
menace every Republican incumbent
who has to run with him in the great
industrial States; but the defeat of men
whom the South and West think of as
quislings in any case would seem to
them only a dividend. They may lose
an election, but they are sure to gain a
party.
And the professionals, against all
their traditions, show increasing signs
of acceptance of that which they see no
way to avoid. Senator Goldwater stands
for the repeal of all prior changes in the
America of the ’twenties and resistance
to all future ones.
He is, in this posture, the candidate
of the Southern resistance to the Ken-
nedy civil rights programme, and his
promise is to carry the South for the
Republicans. The Republican delega-
tion to Congress has been surprisingly
distant towards the Administration’s Civil
Rights Bill; this attitude is a response to
the abdication of Rockefeller and the
potential anointment of Goldwater; one
business of an American legislative
opposition is to make the record of its
presidential candidate.
The Senator spent Independence Day
leading a frontier parade in his native
Phoenix, Arizona; some 9000 of his
partisans came to Washington to shout
at a “Draft Goldwater” meeting. It had
been conceived at a time when his
nomination was inconceivable; it was
being played out after events had made
his nomination most plausible. Events,
of course, cannot alter habit; the Gold-
waterites, now a power force, cannot
leave off acting like a sect. Their
loudest boos were for Harvard; their
loudest cheers for the playing of
“Dixie.” Their buttons wore devices
like “Repeal the Income Tax” and
“Keep Prayer in the Schools.” Observers
noted two facts which, under ordinary
circumstances, define any political
gathering as of persons who are going
nowhere: everyone in the audience
seemed either under the age of twenty-
three or over the age of sixty-five; and
the chairman announced the size of the
crowd from the platform.
But June had rendered these con-
siderations irrelevant. There is every
sign that this was the last display of the
amateur spirit and that henceforth
Barry Goldwater belongs to the pro-
fessionals, to be shaped as best they
can. That is unbelievable, but that is
what seems to have happened. And
even if believable, the Senator remains
untranslatable.
There are few referents within the
American tradition and I can think of
none outside it. Who can conceive of
a Poujade who is pleasant, a Beaver-
brook who is humble, a de Gaulle the
single expression of whose intellect was
the invention of a pair of under-
drawers covered with ants, to be worn
by men with “ants in their pants,” an
anachronism who flies a jet aircraft?
Yet that is what the Republicans seem
resigned or determined to give us.

Profile
JAMES BALDWIN
A voice for Negro bitterness and passion
Small and frail, a Negro writer walks
into a Harlem club. Above the up-
roar a man announces that James
Baldwin is there, and the dancers and
drinkers cheer the neighborhood hero
who has become a spokesman for his
people. They may not have read his
novels or even the brilliant autobio-
graphical and polemical essay on the
Negro question, “The Fire Next Time”.
But they know Baldwin as a man who
represents their bitterness and passion,
and who articulates the new heightened
temper of the racial crisis in America.
Baldwin’s occasional hysteria also
mirrors their condition. Like him, they
have lost patience with white liberalism.
They believe him when he says that
Robert Kennedy does not understand
Negro attitudes.
Actually, Jimmy Baldwin is not often
in Harlem, or even in New York. He
has long found the United States an
impossible country in which to write
anything more important than magazine
articles. In his role as artist rather than
polemicist, he needs to travel to Paris
or Istanbul or Puerto Rico, where color
creates no barriers. London is fof him
as intolerable as New York.
When in New York he lives at the
opposite end of Manhattan Island from
Harlem, in one room decorated by
Negro artists, with jazz on the gramo-
phone, Scotch whisky usually in his hand.
And here he talks until 5 a.m. with
an incantatory kind of eloquence which
reminds one that he began life as a Holy
Rolling boy-preacher.
His mannerisms make him seem an
improbable prophet. He is restless and
extraordinarily sensitive to the mood of a
conversation. He is constantly suspicious,
on the edge of withdrawal until con-
vinced he is not being patronised or
indulged. But then his alertness and his
self-awareness make him one of the
best talking writers. Like a fledgling, his
eyes widen when he wishes to emphasise
a point. What he has to say is not always
as clear as his rhetoric is stirring.
He was born 38 years ago in Harlem,
the oldest of the nine children of a
Baptist minister. The house in which
he was brought up is now one of the
worst slums in the world, with obscenities
scrawled on unlit landing walls. Then it
was little better. Poverty and discrimina-
tion seemed the endless condition of
the American Negro. Baldwin writes
and talks often of his youth in the “wine
and urine stained hallways,” of being
beaten by the police for fun at the
age of 10, of the neighborhood pimps
and whores, of Negro women trying to
straighten their hair.
Jimmy joined the Holy Rollers and
became a boy-preacher. Congregations
ate from his hand in Philadelphia' as
well as Harlem. “I was never young,”
he says, not simply because he went so
early into the pentecostal pulpit, but
because so much of his youth was spent
helping to bring up his brothers and
sisters. It was not all disagreeable. “There
was in the life I fled,” he says now,
“a zest and a joy and a capacity for
facing and surviving disaster that are
very moving and. very rare.”
For all that, he fled to Paris in 1948
and, for the first time in his life, felt
free. There, no one cared that he was
colored; at least no one arrested him
just because he was colored. He began to
write.
"TN ANOTHER COUNTRY"—
A the long awaited, contro-
versial novel by American Negro
James Baldwin—has been placed
on the banned list by the Com-
monwealth Customs Department
on the advice of the Literature
Censorship Board.
His work has not been exclusively
about the color problem, although what
he has to say about that has inevitably
attracted most attention in the gathering
US crisis. But his novels have the
same theme as his polemical writing.
It is the need for understanding and
love, the importance of a respect for
the individuality of man. In “Giovanni’s
Room” the argument is for a better un-
derstanding of another minority the
homosexuals. His most recent novel, “In
Another Country,” is intended as an
appeal for white and Negro to under-
stand each other better by having a
deeper apprehension of themselves.
Baldwin believes that the solution to
the color question is a moral rather than
a legal one. He finds a situation in
which the white Americans make con-
cessions to Negroes, in which Negroes
are “accepted,” contemptible. Current
American society is, in his judgment,
not worth having. His view is that white
Americans bar Negroes because the
“white man’s unadmitted and appa-
rently to him, unspeakable—private fears
and longings are projected on to the
Negro.” Because whites do not love one
another, they need the Negro problem.
Thus the solution lies in a transfiguration
of the American soul or, at least, per-
sonality; Americans need to recognise
that theirs is not a white civilisation.
But it is not for his romantic and
rather unlikely solution that militant
Negroes look to Baldwin. Some even are
disappointed in it, having hoped that
he might have been the practical leader
who could organise a coherent mass as-
sault on the trembling white citadels.
They, like Baldwin, know that the
Negro will not much longer tolerate
white supremacy and that it is the ap-
palling conditions of life that have made
the anti-integration Black Muslim move-
ment so powerful, rather than the elo-
quence of its prophets. And so they like
to hear Baldwin proclaim: “Time catches
up with kingdoms and crushes them,
gets its teeth into doctrines and rends
them; time reveals the foundation on
which any kingdom rests and eats at those
foundations.”
Baldwin says he has no truck with
the separatist aims of the Muslims. While
he has been called a racist, often by
white liberals angry at his attacks on
them, he goes to great pains to refute
the charge. He explains that he believes
that in Negro ghettoes everyone sym-
pathises with the Muslims, even when
they do not support their racist argu-
ments, and that the whites have asked for
whatever is coming.
But he stands against race hatred.
“Whoever debases others is debasing
himself,” he says. He wants freedom
for Negroes but he is also concerned
“for their dignity, for the health of their
souls, and must oppose any attempt that
Negroes may make to do to others what
has been done to them.”
Baldwin’s achievement as a polemicist
and, in a more limited way, as a novelist,
has been to offer to the American Negro
a shock of recognition and to whites
an insight into a foreign state of mind.
He has been drawn into the political
struggle against his will, for he sees him-
self as an artist.
He is a writer of rare power, has a
sense of the tragic and detests cant. At
the same time, he seems ambivalent in
his attitude to white people, often de-
testing liberals whose company he once
enjoyed. Ironically “The Fire Next Time”
first appeared in the “New Yorker” and
a Guggenheim grant once sustained him.
It may be that Baldwin’s bitterness is
an obstacle to his becoming the kind
of novelist he wants to be, because it
blurs his vision of people. Perhaps he
misreads the American crisis, confusing
his personal position and special dif-
ficulties with those of less isolated
Negroes. But at least, in this latest work
of his to reach us, James Baldwin helps
us to understand why the fires of race
conflict are burning in America, (ofns)

Getting Out The
Budget—l963
Treasurer Holt’s tricky problem in judgment
By J. C. HORSFALL
Next week Harold Holt will be de-
livering his fifth Budget speech in
a row and after missing his target
by such a wide margin last year he will
be anxious to make amends,.not only to
save his own face but also the Govern-
ment’s in the light of a possible election
in the current financial year and the
need to create a new image of growth
and full employment.
The Budget season is a strenuous
one for any Treasurer and, trying too
hard perhaps, Mr Holt cracked up un-
der the strain a couple of years ago.
A Treasurer can also feel friendless,
very lonely. As Mr Reginald Maudling,
the new British Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, said before he brought down
his first Budget last April: “Before the
Budget you can’t talk to your friends
and after it they won’t talk to you.”
In my book, Mr Holt has been an
indifferent sort of Treasurer, though ad-
mittedly he has been plagued more by
the economic elements than any Treas-
urer since strong man E. G. Theodore
held the post under the Scullin Gov-
ernment in the early ’thirties. It has
often seemed in the last five years the
Treasury has been a couple of steps
behind the economic and financial situa-
tion in Australia. When it has tried to
catch up with events it has sometimes
had to take precipitate actions, such
as the measures of late 1960, while
being on the wrong foot so often in the
last year or two it seems to have lost
a lot of its nerve, holding to the straw
of stability as the supreme justification
for its negative attitude towards the
central Government’s role as one of the
main income generators. If Mr Holt, in
fact, has the right qualities in him for
being an outstanding Treasurer, he
surely would have made his last two
Budgets winning posts for expansionist
theories.
As it is, his cheerfulness has been
a pretty poor substitute for positive
expansionary action. For when the
business world has cried out loudly,
its pleas for such action have seemed
to fall on deaf ears, as if Mr Holt
was not hearing them at all that their
cries were simply being lost on the
bushland air of ACT. If- Mr Holt knows
what makes the business world go, he
certainly hasn't reflected this in his
Budgets thus far.
At school, where I knew him, it was
easy to envisage Holt as a future Prime
Minister but not by any long chalk
a Federal Treasurer. Determined and
efficient though he was, he didn’t seem
to have a sum in him in those days.
Yet put him up to debate or on a court
or cricket pitch and the theatre in his
blood came rushing. But time and poli-
tics have weathered Holt. All this is
still there but he has now mastered
arithmetic and even if he cannot talk
as convincingly on economics and fin-
ance, say, as Reginald Maudling, who is
an economist first and politician second,
one wouldn’t underrate his understand-
ing of such matters.
Unless a Prime Minister is his own
Treasurer, like Chifley, whose Secretary
to the Treasury was a mere tool at
the master’s convenience, or in special
circumstances as in the 1930 s with the
Prime Minister more or less a puppet
when Casey managed to make an in-
dividual though not very inspiring im-
pact on a series of Budgets, one strongly
doubts whether a Federal Treasurer can
impress his own image or even ventilate
his own ideas on a Budget in Australia,
say in the same positive way as is
traditional in Britain where Chancellors
are held personally accountable for
Budget themes.
Holt followed eight years of Sir Ar-
thur Fadden who, for all his account-
ancy experience and qualifications, was
only allowed to steer the roughest of
courses between the Scylla of Sir Robert
Menzies’ economic and political intui-
tion and the Charybdis of Sir Roland
Wilson’s professional expertise. One well
remembers Sir Arthur’s hapless reliance
on Sir Roland at a Press conference in
1952 at the Savoy Hotel in London.
When Fadden was asked what he
thought of Australia’s economic situa-
tion and replied “b awful,” Wilson
stepped in quickly to say, “What the
Treasurer really means is . .
Holt has also been a victim of Wil-
son’s strong personality and also, it
seems, of his own special position in
the Cabinet where, though hard on the
heels of the succession, he is inclined to
shelter from the awkwardnesses of con-
trary opinion under the wing of the
Prime Minister. Some of the big mis-
takes of economic and fiscal policy gen-
erally attributed to Holt in the last few
years owe something to these circum-
stances.
For instance, when the warning lights
of inflation were flashing early in 1960
Holt publicly acknowledged them and
it appeared that effective steps might
be taken to prevent the boom developing
further. However, Holt was sat on in
Cabinet, his strong anti-inflationary pro-
posals were squashed and the boom al-
lowed to proceed, with the inevitable
result.
Also, when called upon to burst the


bubble in November, 1960, Holt was
again the victim, this time of Cabinet’s
acceptance of the Treasury’s proposal
to disallow interest as tax deductible
in an attempt to nail the speculative
borrowing of finance companies. Fur-
ther, the disinflationary policy accom-
panying this ill-advised measure and the
squeeze on internal demand it entailed
in the interests of rescuing the balance
of payments, was clearly the product
of Sir Roland Wilson’s and other Treas-
ury thinking. Although there is no rea-
son to think Holt, or the entire Cabinet
for that matter, didn't subscribe to it,
neither the policy itself nor the subse-
quent slowness in pushing ahead with
recovery measures can be blamed en-
tirely on the Treasurer.
Miscalculations
/Getting a little nearer the present, there
is the additional example of the
out-turn of the 1962-63 Budget whose
estimates were based on a Treasury
judgment that the harvest from the loan
market would be considerably less than
in the previous year whereas, as it turned
out, without having a cash loan as is
usual in May, loan raising exceeded the
previous year’s by no less than £77 mil-
lion. In that instance, Holt was simply
the victim of his Department’s mis-
calculations.
While it is obviously wrong to regard
a Federal Treasurer as merely a figure-
head in Budget and economic policy-
making, one who makes the speech but
doesn’t necessarily know what it is all
about to the last detail, there is some-
times a whiff of truth in this. However,
nobody who had heard Mr Holt deliver
a Budget speech will question his grasp
of its subject matter nor his close ac-
quaintance with the niceties of economic
argument. Nor will anybody who, three
years ago, heard him give a masterly
exposition of the state of the economy
to a group of Melbourne businessmen,
using no notes at all, forget him. Though
the Minister for Labor and National
Service would probably not agree, Holt
was not all that bad a choice for Treas-
urer. At any rate, for better or worse,
next week will be his fifth Budget and
like the other four he will defend it to
the death, that is until he packs his
bags early on in the debate to attend
the World Bank and IMF meetings over-
seas as he is wont to do at this time of
the year.
His task this year is not made any
easier by the fact he is being pressed
on all sides to bring down a “bold and
imaginative Budget” which, by giving
liberal tax reliefs, would impart new
life to business and industrial activity
and so initiate a new round of economic
expansion. Nor has Mr Holt helped
matters much by echoing this optimism
from his side of the fence, committing
himself to a Budget based on pros-
perity and expansion. All this sanguine
talk, coupled with the knowledge of a
bulging kitty in the Treasury, has
brought public expectations of tax con-
cessions to a high pitch, as witness the
pre-Budget buoyancy of share markets.
So the Budget will have to measure up
to the highest hopes or run the danger
of falling flat, just as Mr Maudling’s
British Budget, for all its widespread
reliefs (£267 million sterling in all),
did in April. As sustained revivals in
business’s and consumers' confidence are
the missing links in today’s prosperity
chain, that would be a most regrettable
result.
Yet, and here one comes to a crucial
point in calculating how far it is pos-
sible for the Treasurer to go in measur-
ing up to the community's pre-Budget
expectations, Mr Holt is not the absolute
master of all the elements affecting the
Budget but rather like a puppet master
without strings to all his puppets.
It is generally conceded, for instance,
that in one way or another consumer
spending needs to be stimulated quite
strongly so that it can be translated into
bigger orders for industry and in turn
into the absorption of the considerable
deadweight of surplus industrial capa-
city and thus open up new vistas for
fixed private investment. It is also recog-
nised (as is obvious from the slow in-
crease in retail sales) that nothing has
so far succeeded in breaking down the
caution in consumer spending which
has persisted for more than two years.
Neither the four months of concentrated
tax reliefs in March to June last year
nor the recent increase in margins has
succeeded in doing this.
The Treasurer must be so frustrated
at this that he will be very sorely
tempted to make personal tax conces-
sion on the grand scale in this Budget.
However, before jumping to hasty con-
clusions one must recognise that Treas-
ury officials fear what the full-dress
basic wage case coming up next Feb-
ruary may do to increase personal in-
comes. Coming on top of the recent
10 per cent increase in margins now
being applied (somewhat unevenly, bank
officials say) through the wages struc-
ture, this could put paid to price (and
also cost) stability. Now Mr Holt must
wish he had a controlling string out to
the Arbitration Commission.
But that is not the only consideration
for him to weigh in this matter of
stimulating consumer spending, for prob-
ably the biggest imponderable of all lies
in the future attitude of the community
towards savings. Quite apart from the ex-
tent to which new additions to disposable
incomes will be spent or saved, what
are the chances of a big switch of funds
out of existing savings banks accounts
(these increased by £2OO million or more
last year, far and away the biggest yearly
increase ever)? The same fear haunted
Mr Maudling last April. As the “Econo-
mist” put it, “he laid emphasis upon the
large margins of error in his calcula-
tions of the trend of effective demand
which can go awry, for example,
through the slightest shift in the propen-
sity to save.”
One would say that this imponderable
is probably the biggest on the Treas-
urer’s plate on the eve of the Budget
and even bigger in fact than it was for
Mr Maudling in Britain in April. The
latter said "the final decision on how
much extra demand is to be infused by
the Budget must be an act of judg-
ment.” And so it must be for Mr Holt.
This is such a tricky judgment to
make that Mr Holt will have to be
very careful not to build too many in-
flexible tax concessions into his Budget,
but rather make reliefs as flexible as
possible in case saving becomes un-
fashionable again too quickly for the
comfort both of the Treasury and the
economy as a whole.
A leaf from the UK Tax Book
T>earing this in mind, one would think
there is a stronger case than anybody
seems to have conceded so far in Bud-
get discussions for concentrating the
main personal tax concessions on in-
direct taxes such as sales tax and ex-
cise duties, particularly on beer and to-
bacco, and giving a clear warning that
the new rates could well be revised in
the course of the year. This would be
taking a useful leaf out of Britain's tax
book which introduced a 10 per cent
either way regulator for indirect taxes
some time ago. In his April Budget Mr
Maudling took powers to make the 10
per cent regulator easier to reduce in
case of need.
This is not to say that persona] in-
come tax should not be reduced but
if reductions in indirect taxes* on con-
sumption were strong enough it
is probable that a further 5 per cent
cut in personal rates would be sufficient,
particularly if this was calculated as an
average cut in the revenue estimate for
such taxes and achieved mainly by con-
centrating relief on the lower and middle
ranges of income and not on a flat
basis that is where the March-June
1962 tax reliefs went wrong as a method
of stimulating spending. People in the
higher income ranges, whose 5 per cent
per annum cuts (actually 15 per cent as
concentrated into the four-month per-
iod) amounted to so much more than
the same percentage cuts on small in-
comes, were bound to save most of the


relief whereas the latter were more
likely to spend most of theirs. The
Treasurer should find new scope along
these lines for giving worth-while re-
liefs to special sections of the com-
munity, especially families and for edu-
cation.
Nor does this mean that pensioners
should miss out and reports from Can-
berra suggest that they won’t. However,
one would be somewhat reluctant to
increase child endowment at this par-
ticular time because once a rise in this
is written into the books nothing on earth
will ever erase it. It is an illogical hand-
out in that the rich do not need it at
all and the poor could do with more
of it. However, if the Treasurer con-
centrates on indirect taxes for his re-
liefs and weights his income tax re-
ductions in the manner outlined above,
the poor would do better from the
Budget than anybody, which would be
a good thing anyway. And, incidentally,
it should be remembered that there is
a strong link in Treasury minds between
child endowment funds and payroll tax,
which was originally introduced for the
purpose of financing child endowment.
To them it would be most illogical to
raise child endowment rates and at the
same time reduce payroll tax as they are
being persistently urged to do. But more
of that in a minute.
Dovetailing measures on all counts
Tf, with the propensity to save so inde-
A terminate and with the prospect of
another basic wage increase looming
up, the Treasurer is puzzled at the
likely trend of disposable incomes and
finds it difficult to measure the scope
for cuts in personal taxes, the same
is true for business taxes.
The Treasurer has two inter-related
tasks to perform in the latter field, one
to bolster business confidence, the other
to give a decisive fillip to private in-
vestment. He can take definite steps
directed to accomplish both these tasks
but success will also depend to a large
extent on what decisions he takes
directly to increase personal incomes
and spending. Above all, he has to dove-
tail his measures on all these counts,
giving the right emphasis to each in
relation to the existing pattern and likely
responses of the various sources of
income generation, so that the economy
doesn’t start firing too rapidly on all
cylinders and so develop boom con-
ditions. There is a distinct danger that
an all-out Budget would generate such
conditions before the full year has run
its course and the Treasurer must there-
fore beware lest he overdoes his con-
cessions.
To get a decisive lift in business con-
fidence, it is fairly obvious from the pre-
Budget advice given to the Treasurer,
at least from secondary industry, com-
merce and the stock exchanges, that he
will fail unless he gives substantial
taxation reliefs to businesses, that is
company tax (now Bs. in the £ on public
companies), the equivalent taxes on
private companies (including the 35 per
cent maximum for profit retentions) and
payroll tax (now 2i per cent on all
businesses with payrolls exceeding £l2O
a week).
What does one mean by “substantial”?
In this context the business world would
probably settle for a reduction to 7s. 6d.
in company tax, simply because it
doesn’t expect any greater cut.
Some people seem to think the
Treasurer could afford Is. with equiva-
lent relief to private companies coupled
with a lowering of payroll tax to 2 per
cent (equal to a 20 per cent reduction).
Such a cut in payroll tax should be
coupled with the intimation that it is
only the first instalment of cuts in pay-
roll tax (the most obnoxious and worst
tax from the viewpoint of businesses and
also of the economy as a whole) which
will eventually do away with the tax
altogether.
As it would appear that even yet the
company world is not availing itself
very actively of the 20 per cent invest-
ment allowances introduced two years
ago, a rise in this allowance would not
have a decisive effect on business con-
fidence.
Given the substantial relief in business
taxes required to boost confidence, it is
by no means certain, however, that this
would prompt the strong revival sought
in private investment which has eluded
the authorities thus far in their efforts
to implement full employment of re-
sources available to the economy. The
snags here are the existence of so much
surplus capacity in industry, the re-
tarded rate of writing off old plant and
the inadequacy of effective demand
which dampens expectations of the
profitability of putting in new plant.
It is fundamental to moving this
block of surplus capacity for the
Treasurer to concentrate his attention
on stimulating effective demand.
For that reason one would leave in-
vestment allowances at their present
level in this Budget because they will
offer a strong enough inducement to put
in new plant once unused capacity is
progressively brought into production
from the flow of new orders to be
expected from the stimulation of
eifective demand.
On the other hand it would certainly
help to clear away a lot of old wood in
industry if the Treasurer could devise
some sort of obsolescence allowance.
He could do this in fact by offering
further depreciation allowances on plant
that has already been fully written off
for tax purposes. The effect on private
investment of such a measure could well
be quite startling.
Increases in Expenditure
|"|ne of the fascinations of pre-Budget
advice to the Government in this and
most other countries is that it invariably
relates mostly to ways to relieve the
burden of taxes. Much less advice is
received on how the Government should
dispose of its revenue, though plenty of
words are usually spilt in the cause of
increasing hand-out for pensions, social
services and other benefits.
However, it is very pertinent to the
possible scope for tax reliefs this year
to acknowledge that in quite a number
of directions the Government is up for
substantial increases in expenditure. To
name a few: defence, payments to the
States both for tax reimbursements and
in non-repayable grants, departmental
costs (wage increases will lift these con-
siderably), pensions (strongly tipped for
a ss. a week rise), child endowment
(increasing anyway from new births and
immigration but possibly due for a rise
in the weekly payment rate) and road
grants.
- All these come within the Consoli-
dated Revenue and Expenditure Ac-
counts. But that is by no means the
whole story. In recent years the Budget
has become a composite affair em-
bracing revenue expenditure on both
Consolidated and Loan Account and
the Budget’s cash surplus or deficit is
determined by the net amount the
Treasury has to resort to short-term
borrowing to pay its way over the year.
This brings one to probably the most
crucial task of the Treasurer in framing
the Budget, that is to estimate the extent
to which the economy will need a
stimulus from an overall cash deficit
financed by a net increase in the
Government’s short-term debt or a
dampener engineered by a net repay-
ment of short-term debt over the year.
This is largely a matter of economic
judgment. But having made his estimate
one way or the other, it is quite another
matter for the Treasurer to arrange
things to get the desired surplus or
deficit and this has become all the more
difficult now that all Government ex-
penditure and revenue from all sources,
taxation, business undertakings, loans


and otherwise, are lumped together in a
composite cash budget.
There are any number of niggers in
this great pile, though the blackest in
recent years, particularly last year, was,
of course, the .Treasurer’s estimate of
loan proceeds, which turned out to be
so inaccurate that instead of the
estimated “cash” deficit of £llßl
million budgeted for, inter alia with the
idea of giving this much additional
stimulus to the economy, the final
Budget out-turn was a £l6 million
surplus or, to that extent, a dampener
for the economy.
Naturally the Treasurer will bend
over backwards in next week’s Budget
to incorporate in it a more accurate
estimate of loan raisings. In fact his
estimate on this will have a critical
bearing on the rest of the Budget, the
extent of tax concessions in particular.
From all accounts the Treasury is very
optimistic about the prospects for its
loan harvest from both the local and
overseas markets this year, quite the
opposite to the view it took incorrectly
this time last year. However, if
estimated loan proceeds are of the order
of those actually raised last year, it is
quite possible that the estimated “cash”
deficit to be announced in the Budget
will turn out to be much less than last
year’s estimated £llßi million, though
this does not mean that the Treasurer
will necessarily be niggardly with his
tax concessions.
However, if the Treasurer goes for
only a small deficit he is quite likely to
come under heavy fire from Mr. R. J.
Hawke in next February’s full-dress
basic wage hearing because the trade
unions’ advocate has a pet method for
measuring the stimulus imparted by the
Budget, that is, by the degree to which
the deficit of the latest year exceeds the
deficit of the previous year. One doesn’t
subscribe to this theory but it raised
quite a lot of dust in the Justices’ eyes in
the Arbitration Court earlier this year.
Nor is a “small” deficit likely to
please the Melbourne “Herald,” which
prefers to extract all Federal Govern-
ment expenditure on capital works from
the estimated deficit. Thus it con-
sidered that the estimated <£.1183
million deficit last year was in effect a
surplus of £IOO million.
The various interpretations—and there
are others —of the Budget sums only
go to show that these days this key
document in the economic scheme of
things has become far too unwieldy
and complicated for the ordinary lay-
man to comprehend. He can’t be
blamed if next week he sums up Mr.
Holt’s latest effort in a biting phrase
or two, judging it on the straight-out
criterion of whether he is up for more
or less tax. With a little bit of luck it
could be quite a lot less.
Letters

editore
M. H. ELLIS AS CRITIC
Sir,
Mr M. H. Ellis would be the first per-
son to deplore deviousness in a reviewer,
whether it take the form of distortion,
inaccuracy, or omission. His review of
the Oxford booklets on King and Bourke
(Bulletin, 27/7/63) is all the more dis-
tressing to such professed admirers of his
great historical biographies as myself. He
must have known that these booklets are
for children and geared to higher
primary school level. A review of any
competence would have assessed how
well or badly they fulfil this educational
purpose. But the better to lambast his
enemies, M. H. Ellis has failed to mention
this fact, describing the booklets vaguely
as “brochures”. It is therefore a cheap
and cheapening trick to quote deadpan
from Dr King’s own words to create
the impression that Dr King writes
normally in a primary school style.
I do not propose to draw Mr Ellis’
fire by suggesting that inaccuracies are
permissible in history for children. Far
from it. I have in my time criticised
other titles in Oxford’s admirable series
for incorrect emphasis alone. But with
due deference to the author of that
great work “Lachlan Macquarie”, I
would suggest that he is reducing his
undoubted intellectual integrity to the
appearance of splenetic obsessiveness by
attacking his enemies with weapons more
suited to the debating tricks of the less
gifted of our Federal politicians.

“DEATH OF A CIRCUS?”
Sir,
Charles Higham is to be complimented
on his article on the present problems
facing Australian circuses (27/7/63)
Very few journalists have ever gone to
the trouble of collecting correct data on
our circuses without branching out into
stories that are really only partly true.
Circus fans believe that Australia is
facing a similar problem to that of the
United States in 1957, when the mighty
Ringling concern folded as a tent show
and became an indoor circus. Now, in
1963, we see Ringling’s about to put a
second unit on tour in Europe and, as
John Ringling North put it, “It will give
tangible proof that circus is more alive
than ever, and thereby prove beneficial
to the business of all circuses.”
Again, if Charles Higham had been
shown a copy of an old Wirth programme
he may have seen an interesting little
paragraph under the heading, “Will the
Circus Survive?” It reads: “So long as
there are children there will also be the
circus. For children are the inspiration
and life of a circus. And even though
there are two to four adults with each
child in Wirth's audience that changes
the situation not at all. For when Wirth’s
circus comes to town these adults are
still children at heart, therefore the cir-
cus will survive for all time.”
Let us say then that Australian circus
is just passing through a period of re-
adjustment, and will one day soon return
to days of greater glory.
JAMES T. FOGARTY

Sir,
In “Death of a Circus?” (July 27) I
referred to Sorlie’s Revue, now run by
Sole’s Circus, as “a seedy vaudeville
show in the sticks.” I’m sorry to hear
this has caused Mary Sole some distress.
Sorlie’s Revue is doing good business
in North Queensland, I’m told, and
Miss Sole assures me (and I accept her
statement as true) that the show is not
“seedy” at all.

“CHOICE”
Sir,
‘"What’s sauce for the goose is sauce
for the gander.” Dr Parish was not ex-
actly inoffensive when describing us
(without provocation) as brash, naive,
intellectually and plainly dishonest, etc.,
etc., but he squirms when taken to task
by our Deputy Chairman, Dr Epstein,
under great provocation. Had Dr Parish
discussed the workings of Comparative
Testing with us before publishing his
report he could have saved himself a
lot of embarrassment.
Our Canberra branch did not secede
from ACA; it was encouraged to form
itself into a Local Group by ACA and
with ACA’s financial help. The group
is doing an excellent job with local
emphasis. ACA is promoting similar
Local Consumer Groups in other cities
in Australia.

QQQQRALIAN WINES IN UK
Sir,
In fairness to myself I hope you will
allow me a little space to explain to
Mr F. D. Daniel of Seppelts (20/7/63)
that my original letter of 13/4/63 did
go on to mention appreciatively my dis-
covery of his company’s wines at some
London retailers, and the wide range
now obtainable at the Australian Wine
Centre, which I both know and often
recommend. I acknowledge that de-
mands on space justify the use of the
editorial scissors, but the curtailment of
my letter did make me appear rather
too churlish!
My point was, and is, simply the wish
to see the better Australian wines known
and widely bought here. I will trouble
to go into Soho because I know the
products; the Englishman doesn’t.
Anonymous advertising of “Australian
Wines” seems likely to lead people to
the more easily obtained poor wines
rather than to the good. After 25 years
where does the name “Seppelt” rank in
the English consciousness? By the quality
of their wines it should be high. Is it?

FOREIGN INVESTMENT
Sir,
I could not agree more with Don
Henderson’s article on the “Perils of
Foreign Investment” (27/7/63). Our
need for foreign investment is not that
great that we have to give our natural
assets, the birthright of future Australians,
to foreign financial consortiums.
A typical example is Consolidated
Gold Fields of South Africa’s mining of
West Australian iron ore to sell to Japan.
Barring small royalties and the small
labor force employed, the only final asset
Australia will receive will be a defunct
port, railway line and mining town. The
surprising fact is that the Australian tax-
payer is not paying for the port and the
railway line. The generosity of the chair-
man (Sir George Harvie Watt) in allow-
ing a little Australian participation in
shareholding in our own iron ore was
really condescending and heart-warming.
We can encourage foreign manu-
facturers to bring new industries and new
techniques, but let us have a share in
these.

“RUBBAGE”
Sir,
In Mr Bobby Nelson’s article (27/7/63)
describing the “summer of the gun cane-
cutter”, he twice uses the word “rub-
bage”. I have searched the shorter OED
with diligence but have failed to discover
it. Does he mean “rubbish”, “garbage”,
neither or both? If it is his idea of a
neologism it is quite pointless, as the
meanings of the two words are so close. I
suggest that this sort of literary affectation
be left to the James Joyces of this world.

THE GARDEN ISLAND STRIKE
Sir,
Your Special Correspondent, writing
on the “strike” at Garden Island
(20/7/63) is so biased with McCarthyism
that he attempts to present a genuine
industrial dispute as a threat to security
with completely false inferences of “sabo-
tage” and “espionage”. In the first place
the dispute in HMAS Supply was not
a strike, but could be accurately de-
scribed as a lockout. Up to 152 union-
ists were suspended or dismissed for
refusing to work in Supply or in its
machinery spaces after the management
had refused to meet their claim for four
shillings per day special compartment
rate for work alone in machinery spaces.
At all times the men were willing to per-
form other work, and in fact the man-
agement did recall some suspended men
during the dispute and give them other
work.
Since 1957 the special compartment
rate has been the main disability rate
payable to (partially) offset bad working
conditions in ships’ machinery spaces.
It has been paid in every ship (including
merchant ships) under refit at Garden
Island since its inception by agreement at
that date, and despite your Special Cor-
respondent, but thanks to the action of
dockyard workers, it is now being paid
in Supply.
With this background in mind is it
any wonder that dockyard workers made
a stand to retain what they considered
was their just entitlement, when con-
fronted with the Navy Board refusal to
apply the rate to Supply, which in effect
was a wage cut of £1 per week to many
of them?
As every unionist knows, the function
of union officials and job delegates of
which the Special Correspondent dis-
approves so strongly, is not to meekly
accept wage cuts but to organise resist-
ance to them and where possible force
wages up. Now because the unions at
Garden Island conducted such a defen-
sive struggle, with a considerable measure
of success, they become a threat to
security!
If the Special Correspondent, hiding
behind his cloak of anonymity, is as close
to Garden Island as his knowledge of the
details of the dispute would suggest, he
would know that Garden Island workers,
including delegates, have a very large
percentage of ex-servicemen amongst
them whose loyalty in defence of this
country has been tested and proven, un-
like the Special Correspondent, whose
record is an unknown quality.
In this dispute the unions exercised
considerable discipline, despite provoca-
tion, and refrained from extending the
dispute to other ships and other unions.
It was only after their bitter and futile
experiences before two examples of arbi-
tration, a compulsory conference before
a Conciliator and a Board of Reference,
that a strong deputation to the Navy
Minister led by the Labor Council of
NSW was held and a limited break-
through was made.
After a lengthy conference, and con-
fronted with the partially dismantled
Supply in Captain Cook Dock with an
immediate and total black ban hanging
over it if the management attempted to
shift it, the Navy Minister stated he was
convinced the unions were most sincere
in their application and agreed to pay
the 4s. per day “without prejudice” back
to the start of the refit, reinstate all the
suspended men without loss of privileges,
and negotiations to continue with the
Labor Council around future application
of special compartment rate. These ne-
gotiations are proceeding and the “Spe-
cial Correspondent’s” vitriolic attack has
not helped the Navy Board's case at all.

REVIEWS
MUSIC
The French Style
Georges Tzipine’s Energy
By JOHN SMALL
Tzipine's recent series of Syd-
ney concerts, if they provided noth-
ing else, gave audiences an opportunity
to make up their minds about the
strengths and weaknesses of the French
style in music, of which Tzipine is a
representative exponent. So representative
is he that it is hard to assess him on his
own, as it were; one has continually to
refer to the musical tradition to which he
belongs, and make judgments about it.
Tzipine’s faults and virtues belong not
so much to him as to French music, and
whether or not one responds favorably
to Tzipine depends on the attitude one
has to French music in general.
Of the works that Tzipine conducted
in Sydney, Beethoven’s Seventh Sym-
phony was probably the least success-
ful. However, its faults were illumina-
ting. Largest amongst these was the
treatment that Tzipine gave to the
work’s rhythms, which accorded with
the practice that French composers and
executants have followed for at least
250 years and probably longer.
The French are more interested in
rhythm’s significance for musical form
than in its expressive or propulsive
properties. Hence, French rhythms
often sound a little stiff and inflexible,
and the accented beats seem to mark
stages in the progress of the music,
dividing the melody up into a series
of small discreet units which are or-
ganised into a carefully worked out
pattern. The complement of this is a
tendency to short-windedness in melody
a vice to which most French com-
posers seem to succumb at one time or
another.
Beethoven's Seventh is about as far
removed from this conception of
rhythm as one could imagine. In Tzi-
pine’s account of it this “Dionysiac orgy
of vast proportions,” as Lang calls it,
seemed to have lost a great deal of
steam. Its enormous energy seemed to
be held in check by the rhythmic pulse,
instead of finding expression in it. The
melodies, most of which are hyposta-
tised rhythms, seemed to be hemmed in
by the strictness of the metre.
Tzipine’s way of compensating for
this was also typically French. He set
about infusing the work with that gal-
vanic energy which seems to be the
standard French substitute for what one
might call musical virility. So that what
one heard was a somewhat effete and
tensed-up version of Beethoven’s orig-
inal work. The fact that most French
conductors treat Beethoven in much
this way gives Tzipine excellent pre-
cedents and excuses for doing as he
did, but it does not make his treat-
ment of the Seventh Symphony any
less unfair to that composer.
Tzipine’s treatment of rhythm squares
with other facets of the French ap-
proach to music. Like many other
French musicians, Tzipine is not very
concerned with inner significance or
musical metaphysics. He prefers to con-
centrate instead on more palpable aspects
of music to cultivate beauty and even-
ness of sound, regularity of metre,
soberness of diction. He has little taste
for the grand gesture or the heroic
pose, which is not to say that he eschews
virtuosity. He is more concerned with
style and balance than with using music
as a vehicle for a message or for emo-
tional display.
These traits are considerable virtues
at some times and severe limitations at
others. They were no help at all in the
Seventh Symphony or in Bach’s Third
Brandenburg Concerto, the latter of
which was made to sound very brisk
and rather trivial. They were consider-
able assets in the performance of the
accompaniment to three Verdi arias
sung by John Shaw. Verdi is one com-
poser whose music comes through
sounding just right if only the performer
takes no liberties with it, and does no
more than play what is written. Tzi-
pine’s attention to the qualities of the
music as sheer sound was just what
was needed to bring out the expressive
qualities of Verdi’s scores, so that
Shaw’s strong, resonant baritone was
provided with an admirable foil.
But Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,”
which many French conductors have
conducted superbly, was not a success,
for reasons unconnected with Tzipine’s
musical provenance. Tzipine's besetting
fault in these concerts —• a purely
personal one was his seeming in-
ability to keep the orchestra playing
at a high level of proficiency for very
long. Some very fine playing near the
end of the first half of this work was
offset by instances of badly co-ordinated
and inaccurate work throughout. Tzi-
pine is capable of getting the orchestra
to play very well, but only in patches;
and the demands made on the orchestra
by this work were just not consistently
met. On the showing Tzipine made in
these concerts one would not think that
he had won the Grand Prix du Disque
three times. But it is possible that Tzipine
needs more rehearsal time than is avail-
able for the normal orchestral concert,
and that we have not yet seen him at
his best.

T/Try little on show in recent months
T remotely approaches the quality of
this collection of Thai art, if indeed
any comparison can be made at all.
Since it is drawn from one of the
world’s golden ages in art history,
superlatives seem redundant, and Thai
art is undiscovered territory for Aus-
tralian gallery - goers. This exhibition
helps to fill a big gap in our knowledge
of a fundamental activity which affords
more than ordinary insight into the mind
of one near neighbor. Like other South-
east Asian countries Thailand developed
Brahmanic and Buddhist cultures; Siva
and Buddha both are represented here
in sculpture with, of course, the greater
emphasis on the latter.
Since images were made from models
of tested spiritual worth, gesture and
feature were fixed, but as in the tonal
patterns of Indian music innumerable
interpretations were made, so here each
sculpture reflects one of the infinitely
subtle attributes of Buddha himself.
From the playful vigor of the Dvaravati
style (6th-11th century) with its pro-
nounced Gupta aesthetic to the national
or Ayodhya style (15th-18th century)
the themes underwent considerable
transformation. Universality was ach-
ieved through accepted symbol and
iconography and its expression in a
form characteristic of racial type. This

Technically, the chiselling of such

JOHN HENSHAW
THEATRE
Spanish Steps
Fando and Lis. The Two Execution-
ers. Fernando Arrabal. Union
Theatre. Sydney.
Oydney University Dramatic Society
is taking a lot of pride in itself for
staging such a determinedly avant-garch
piece of current theatre as “Fando and
Lis,” by Spanish writer Fernando Arra-
bal, and perhaps just a little of the
pride is justified. One can salute the
courage and the effective direction of
the company, whilst refusing to go
along with the producer’s high regard
for the playwright or his two short
plays.
In “The Two Executioners,” a
mother denounces her husband to the
law and two executioners flog him to
death, just off-stage. With her two sons,
one loyal to her come what may, the
other not, she indulges in a monologue
of self-justification. She upbraids the
disloyal son, but bars the other from
striking him. She breaks off to pour
vinegar on her husband’s wounds.
Finally, after the bloody corpse is car-
ried off, through her room, the other
son is reconciled with her, too.
The moral is, I suppose, that even
mothers can be wrong —or perhaps
that Mother is always right. Mr Arra-
bal’s piece didn’t show me a clear way
to his thoughts at all.
Fando and Lis are a young man and
his crippled girl, bound on a journey
to Tar a place that never appears.
Fando carries Lis, or pushes her in a
pram. He loves Lis but hates the burden
that she is. They will never get to Tar.
He ill-treats Lis, chains her, puts her
naked on the roadway, and finally
beats her when she is sick. Lis dies,
Fando goes to her grave, with a flower,
and a charming dog. Three men under
one umbrella discuss it all.
To tell the story thus baldly is no
disservice for that is all it is. A
simple love-hate tale that simply gets
one nowhere. Nothingsville in neo-
Spanish.

ting. Secondary Teachers’ College
Dramatic Society. Melbourne. Wild-

Theatre. Melbourne.
Tn “A Penny For a Song” John Whiting
A has shown both how to write a play
and how not to write one. The year is
1804 and Sir Timothy Bellboys, whose
house stands on the Dorset coast, is
hourly expecting a French invasion led
by Napoleon. Having decided that the
Government is doing nothing, he has de-
vised a plan to save England himself,
single-handed. Sir Timothy represents
that mixture of public-spiritedness and
eccentric individualism which is so
characteristically English.
But into this gay and gentle comedy,
admittedly a period piece, but neverthe-
less essentially realistic, John Whiting
has introduced two entirely symbolic
characters. There is a blind soldier,
who has just returned from France and
is going to London to ask the king to
stop the war. His guide is a little orphan
boy who is on his way to Bethlehem be-
cause he has heard the story of the birth
of Christ. He does not know that it
occurred 1800 years before he was born,
and he has not heard of the Crucifixion.
These characters represent abstract ideas
idealism, innocence in a sentimen-
tal and undramatic way. John Whiting’s
orphan child, in particular, reminded
me of the kind of simplified and senti-
mentalised version of Biblical stories that
are inflicted on children at Sunday school.
The misguided but heroic efforts of
Sir Timothy Bellboys to save his fellow
men are presented entirely through the
action of the play and handled with a
very light touch. But the parallel figure
of the blind soldier, also trying to save
his fellow men by a misguided but heroic
effort, seemed at once heavy and insub-
stantial.
Ron Danielson’s delightful production
followed the advice of the playwright
and made full use of stage machinery.
Humpage, the lookout, was ensconced in
his tree along with spy-glass, bell and
signals. The well, with its bucket by
which Sir Timothy descended, worked
very convincingly. But the pieces de
resistance were the beribboned balloon
dropping gaily down with its cargo of
false Napoleon and the beautiful little
red fire engine.
“Wildcat” is a sentimental musical
Western, with a sheriff, but without any
baddies, which is a pity. It is quite
pleasantly nostalgic of childhood Saturday
afternoon matinees at the pictures, but
much, much slower.
Toni Lamond is pretty and bouncing
as Wildcat Jackson, the heroine, who is
determined to strike oil by fair means or
foul. Gordon Boy is suitably rugged as
the hard-drinking Joe Dynamite with
granite face and custard heart. Joe is
fixated on an ultra-feminine creature
called Angeline. “Dopey” Angeline, as
Wildcat so aptly describes her, is the
subject of a number of very tiresome
sentimental lyrics. The direction by
Milton Lyon and the well-disciplined
playing by all the cast seemed to me to
deserve a more sophisticated vehicle,

eat, what to buy in Paris, New York or Tokyo ... or Bangkok and Teheran, for that matter.
“Airlines? As I said, I’ve travelled all over the world, and I’ve flown a lot of airlines. One airline
stands out —Qantas. They do things the way I expect them done. They’re courteous, friendly

FILMS
Star Boarder
The L-Shaped Room. Director, Bryan
Forbes. Embassy Theatre. Sydney.
TJryan Forbes, who directed “The L-
Shaped Room,” also made the
screen adaptation from a novel by
Lynne Reid Banks, the story of a young
woman, estranged from her family and
pregnant after an unenthusiastic love af-
fair, who takes a room in a sleazy Lon-
don lodging-house and decides (against
all reason and advice) to bear her child.
At first lonely and revolted by her sor-
did surroundings, she finds friends and
comfort in her seedy fellow-lodgers and
landlady.
Lynne Reid Banks’ novel had an irri-
tatingly breathless, starry-eyed attitude
to out-of-wedlock pregnancy that made
it hard to take. Bryan Forbes’ film is
still sentimental, but it manages not to
slip into the soap opera class. The
dialogue has a rough realism and humor
and, however weepy the plot may
become, it is firmly based on genuine
human motivation; the temptation of a
facile happy ending is mercifully re-
jected.
Much of the film’s success is due to
Leslie Caron’s endearing performance,
which makes apparent the misery of the
girl’s situation while never presenting
her as a fragile broken blossom.
There are, of course, any number of
cliches in this film. The lodgers are a
stock lot (the good-hearted whore, the
broken-down vaudevillian, the struggling
writer, the over-sensitive Negro you
name them, “The L-Shaped Room’s”
got them) but there is enough indi-
vidual characterisation in the script to
make them a little more than stereo-
types, and a splendidly competent cast
to get full value from it.

Lust for Gold
Politics in a boom decade
By M. H. ELLIS
The Golden Age. Geoffrey Serle. Mel-
bourne University Press. 70s.
things are clear from Dr Serle’s
well-illustrated new book: how rich
a field outside the years of the convict-
period lies virgin for prospecting by
competent Australian historians; and how
rich a crushing even one decade can
yield to somebody who is prepared to
turn over the wash dirt assiduously and
get right down on to the true bottom
with pick and dish.
Victoria had a particularly fortunate
start in its race for development when
the real search for gold began. As a
centre of white settlement the little patch
of eastern Australia south of the River
Murray, and embracing only 87,000 sq.
miles or three per cent of the surface of
the continent, was only 16 years old.
Yet it had accumulated 77,000 settlers.
It had felt the impact of the Hungry
Forties far less than the rest of the
colonies. It already held two-fifths, or six
million, of the sheep in Australia and
was producing about one-fifth of all the
British imports of wool. The Hungry
Forties had not had the same disastrous
impact on it as north of the Murray.
Its population was not only phenomen-
ally large for its age and area, but it
consisted substantially of men of good
county or yeoman families, Scots and
English, experienced in animal and farm
husbandry. It was attracting both re-
sources and men from all directions in
a steady stream. Its capital city was
organised both in form and growth.
Melbourne was certainly the most civi-
lised town in the Australasian Antipodes
and suffered none of the disadvantages
in relation to the productive backlands
of its hated neighbor, Sydney, to the
north. No Blue Mountains shut it off
from its pastoral areas; no rocky ranges
spread their barrenness around it in a
wide swathe, dividing the productive
land from the city by long stretches of
mountain track, negotiable often only
by pack bullock and horse.
In 1851 this earthly paradise of the
south suddenly achieved two things at
once. Within a week of each other came
separation from New South Wales and
James Esmond’s discovery of payable
gold in the Midlands of Clunes. The
clamors of rejoicing over self-govern-
ment and the discovery of payable gold
in two places rose into the air together
on July 15-16, 1851.
The aftermath covering the next
decade somewhat resembled an ex-
plosion in a mint in the middle of a
political riot; a few rioters were
showered with gold, but though for
this minority, and for towns and trade
and transport, wealth was created in
quantity hitherto undreamt of in the
Antipodes, poverty, lawlessness and
political disorder were the lot of the
majority and had impacts on the whole
of the rest of Australia.
The discovery of gold in Victoria pro-
duced results differing widely from the
discoveries in other colonies. In New
South Wales, Queensland, the Northern
Territory and Western Australia the
finds were in remote places for the
most part and in areas unsuitable for
urban and industrial settlement.
Tn Victoria they were made around open,
rich grazing and farming land, in a
climate congenial for Europeans, with
the means of growing food all about,
civilised towns and ports at the very
doors of the fields. Wealth dug from the
ground, therefore, tended to stay where
it was and paid for a highly civilised and
prosperous economy on the spot.
In the rich fields of Araluen, of those
west of the Blue Mountains and in
Queensland’s remote north the exploita-
tion of gold left little in its wake but holes
in the ground and memories of a rough
existence.
The concentration of the Victorian
discoveries in an arc mainly from 15
to 50 miles from Melbourne had another
effect in conjunction with the ease with
which rushes could develop from one
field to another. It held together a vast
but disparate population of all ages and
most uncommon racial and social vari-
ety, in a comparatively small space full
of hysterical eddies and currents and
activated by the noisiest collection of
ambitious magsmen and confidence men
the white world perhaps has ever seen.
These were controlled only by an ele-
mentary sort of government with an
inexperienced police force and a mili-
tary backing accustomed only to beat-
ing down the heathen before the latter
did the beating down.
That anything evolved from this boil-
ing pot of avarice, inefficiency and (of-
ten misdirected) ambition except whole-
sale murder and mayhem is one of
the great mysteries of the universe. But
in the decade which forms Dr Serle’s
terrain the processes consequent on gold
discovery and exploitation remade Vic-
toria, and peopled it with men of more
diverse talents, skills and backgrounds,
and perhaps more vigor, than Australia
had yet seen. They also enabled Higin-
botham, Berry, Syme and Duffy to take
their places in Australia and brought
here the parents of another genera-
tion: The Deakins moving from Ade-
laide, Monashes from Eastern Germany,
the Isaacs and the parents of J. F.
Archibald, Viscount Bruce, Dame Nellie
Melba, Will Dyson, W. G. Spence, and
even the grandparents of Menzies and
Arthur Calwell.
Also, the decade after gold discovery
founded a school of practical politics
which did more to teach the people of
Australia to govern themselves after
their own fashion and according to
their own needs than all the other poli-
tical battle-grounds of the continent put
together, save perhaps Queensland.
Dr Serle’s accounts of events and
trends are sometimes exciting without
being pretentiously descriptive. They are
generally well-balanced and arranged
and easy to follow. It is a treat to be
able to read a careful, consecutive and
analytical account of, say, the Eureka
Stockade affair, one unbedevilled by the
distortions of Marxist interpretation or
by Hibernian obsessionism which gives
the event the same flavor of shamrock
as was apparent in the Irish convict
rebellion on the Hawkesbury in 1804,
The author does not, however, neglect
the political and industrial significances
of the shabby incident. Goldfields con-
tentions and mob-frustrations were great
social levellers, apart from the lessons
learned by participants in the practical
art of political organisation and the
handling of hostile government agencies.
Victoria, having begun the first decade
of the gold era with under 80,000
people, ended 1861 with nearly 550,000.
From its peak year of 1852 in which
taking Coghlan’s figures it pro-
duced just on 4.2 million ounces of
gold, its gold yield was many multiples
per annum that of New South Wales:
27.5 million ounces for the decade.
This gave what The Bulletin used
to refer to as the “Cabbage Garden”
below the Murray River a flying start
over the North and made Melbourne
the social centre of Australian life and
the financial capital of the continent.
Dr Serle’s book is bound to suffer
some correction by the author before
it reaches its next edition: every work
built on such a concentration of detail
is subject to such correction or amend-
ment through unearthing of new mat-
erial or rectification of human error.
But it is well and thoroughly docu-
mented, has an excellent bibliography
and appendices and a sound, if not
copious, index.

Ostrich-land?
A State of England. Anthony Hartley.
Hutchinson. 375. 3d. Encounter.
“Suicide of a Nation” issue. July,
1963. 6s.
ARE British intellectuals irritated, un-
sure and lethargic? Anthony Hart-
ley’s “A State of England” marshals
convincing evidence to show that some
of them at least are depressed, while
others are hectically chauvinistic
through a kind of over-compensation. In
explanation, politicians on the Left can,
and do, point to a decade of Conserva-
tive rule a decade of breathtaking in-
competence in most governmental fields.
Suez, Cyprus, the will-o’-the-wisp “in-
dependent nuclear deterrent", teachers’
pay, inflation, deflation, unemployment,
and always the threat of economic crisis.
There’s no denying that it's an impres-
sive catalogue of failure and dis-
honesty. (Did Profumo’s lies really shock
anybody who remembered Suez, with its
seven different Front Bench explanations
in 11 days?) But over this same decade,
what of the Labor Movement, if, as
Anthony Hartley asks, anything so static
can properly be called a movement? If
British intellectuals are migrating to the
United States and Australia to escape
depression, one cause may well be the
feeling of helplessness radiating from a
House of Commons whose debates catch
the newspaper headlines but make not
the slightest difference to policy.
Labor, admittedly, cannot be blamed
for the kind of bland inertia that pegs
the old-age pension while businessmen
make whoopee with uncontrolled expense
accounts. As Professor G. M. Carstairs
suggested in last year’s Reith Lectures, a
loss of public concern for the less well-
off seems to be one of the things haunt-
ing Britain’s “national consciousness”
and lack of concern is a Conservative
speciality, part of unflappable Mac-
Wonder’s basic stock-in-trade. But for
some years now the close similarity of
Government and Opposition has been
inescapable. In “A State of England”,
Anthony Hartley argues that popular dis-
trust of governments is now a world-
wide phenomenon. This may be so, but
he still underestimates the discouraging
effect of House of Commons Butskel-
lism. He also misrepresents that chaotic
but (in Britain) basically logical move-
ment, CND. It was bad luck that his
book should go to Press just before the
Macmillan Government had to give up
the manufacture of British nuclear
devices exactly what CND had press-
ed for. But there is still no excuse for
his clubman’s-eye-view of the Alder-
maston - Trafalgar - Square - Wethers-
field demonstrators. He depicts them as
woolly-minded romantics irresponsibly
wrecking democracy in general and the
Labor Party in particular.
Encounter's “Suicide of a Nation”
issue also undertakes a survey of current
British attitudes and difficulties. Its
special editor, Arthur Koestler, sees
England as part-lion, part-ostrich, rising
magnificently to the occasion in times
of emergency but, between crises, bury-
ing its head in the sand. “Hence,” says
Koestler, “the alarming title and the
hopeful question-mark.”
When 18 authors contribute to a book-
length symposium on a topic so complex
as the state of England, you would
expect fairly wide divergence of opinion.
Occasionally, here, you get it. But what
is surprising in these essays is their broad
unanimity. From the cap-and-bells word-
spinners at the beginning (Henry Fairlie,
Malcolm Muggeridge) to the cap-and-
gown economists further on (Michael
Shanks, Andrew Shonfield, John Vaizey),
nearly all the writers agree that Britain
has ignored her major problems for too
long. If she is to save herself from bank-
ruptcy and mental stagnation, she must,
in these competitive 19605, define and
attack her shortcomings - and quickly.
Despite a recurrent drift towards im-
pressionistic, evasively retrospective
writing, the “Encounter” essayists pin
down several of these national problems
firmly and finely. This is especially so
with the six articles showing the effect
on British morale and the British
economy of a perpetuated class war.
While Management cultivates the art of
gentlemanly incompetence, Labor
cherishes a Trade Union system whose
ramification, rigidity and general inep-
titude are almost incredible to visitors
from (say) Sweden. Britain’s archaic
system of apprenticeship, like the de-
marcation strikes it brings about, would
be richly comic if it were not so tragical-
ly wasteful of skill and energy.
In a middle group of “Encounter”
essays, Hugh Seton-Watson and John
Mander look at Britain in the wider
context of European and world politics.
By some unexplained accident of group-
ing, this section also includes Lord
Altrincham's case for the drastic reform
of Parliament.
Finally come the articles which for
want of a more precise word must be
called sociological. The authors here are
Cyril Connolly, Marcus Cunliffe, Alan
McGlashan, Elizabeth Young and John
Vaizey. Just as in Anthony Hartley’s
book though in vaguer terms the
main attack is on Britain’s education
system. This, as Koestler says in his
summing-up. “tears the nation apart and
provides, generation after generation, a
new crop of unwilling combatants for
the cold class war.”

J'Fhese books have in common strange
A and distant settings and a strong
documentary interest: the best of them
have besides a serious concern with a
serious human problem. In none of them,
I think, is the concern with a social issue,
a strange society or an unfamiliar land-
scape happily integrated with the fiction:
the story is stuck on to the documentary;
the events do not emerge fully and
freely from the backgrounds; the plots
do not illustrate the themes. The con-
ventional nature of many of the
episodes in these books is best illustrated
by the love scenes. Sexual intercourse is
adumbrated usually with Henty-ish
reticences in all these stories, many
times in some of them. Only in ‘‘Jangara”

Powell. This saga of America’s last
frontier wilderness the Florida Ever-
glades is the work of an expert tech-
nologist. The standard ingredients are
exactly weighed out and carefully blend-
ed. There s even a little artificial grit and
roughage, so that our mental bowels feel
they have something to work on, but it’s
all pre-cooked, pre-digested, and utterly
conventional: the intellectual equivalent
of Rice Krispies
’
Gwyn Griffin is a much more formid -
able professional writer. “Freedom Ob-
served” is a very competent, almost slick
tale about the end of colonial rule in
French Equatorial Africa. It has a sour
disillusion in the earlier chapters as one
after another the groups involved are
shown as foolish, incompetent or utterly
self-interested and unscrupulous. The
United Nations observer is everybody’s
fool, the erudite President a stuffed
shirt, his Prime Minister vicious. But the
deepest villains are the French adminis-
trators in their rivalries and their efforts
to maintain France’s power and prestige.
The novel may not be true in its presen-
tation of colonial politics but it is con-
vincing.
Naomi Doudayi’s “Street of the Four
Winds” is by contrast a little amateurish,
beating up a frenetic jolliness at times
in the early pages but maintaining
throughout an unselfconscious moral
decency. The interest is in the tensions
between Jews of different cultural origins
in the difficult years before and after the
British left Israel and the new State
came into being. The plot is a string for
the documentary,
u,„,, , c . .
Jangara, by John Sawkins, again is
concerned with the clash of cultures and
the end of colonialism, in the Sudan this
time. The situation is more complex, and
the exploration more profound. A central
character is Helliwell, a new kind of
Englishman in Africa, an academic an-
thropologist on his first field trip, decent,
intelligent, narrowly educated and
emotionally limited, but observing, and
struggling to understand and sympathise
even while he stands rather aloof. He
couldn’t write a novel, but for the rest
perhaps he resembles the author. In
“Freedom Observed” disaster came from
impurity of motive and dishonesty in
action. In “Jangara” most of the charac-
ters try to act for the best, from Mansour,
the Arab Angelo who is the first Sudanese
District Commissioner, to the naked
Dinka tribesmen in the distant province
he is sent to govern, but disaster comes
all the same. The plot strains at times,
and a central cog in it, the half-Dinka,
half-English girl Dia, is hardly credible
but all the same, one can without
embarrassment, mention “A Passage to
India” in the same paragraph.


Olaf Ruhcn’s “The Flockmaster” is the
only one of these novels by an Australian
writer. It is much simpler than all the
others in action and character. The Liv-
ings family trek with their flocks from
somewhere near the rocket range to take
up new land to the far north-west. Father
dies, the three children continue, picking
up a bushed couple on the way, emotional
tangles come gently to blood-heat, across
the desert they find good land and settle,
in a sudden outburst of violence the
Gordian knots of passion are cut by two
deaths and a birth. Ruhen is a very
good descriptive writer, an exact and
sensitive observer of the natural world;
his simple plot provides a garnish for
this documentary of a trek through the
interior.

Polio
Margin of Safety. John Rowan Wil-
son. Collins. 345. 9d.
PTYns is a book, basically factual, about
the development of vaccines in the
US to control acute anterior polio-
myelitis which used to be called infantile
paralysis. It is written by the assistant
editor of the “British Medical Journal” in
a readable, quizzical style. He sketches
in the sociological perspectives behind
the events, the personalities, and the
philanthropic and commercial institutions
which were concerned. The result is a
fascinating account of the way a vigorous
people set about correcting by private
enterprise a biological disability which
revealed itself in their society.
In a way, the Americans felt that
polio was their disease. Their first great
epidemic of 1916 affected 27,000 and
killed 6,000, 2,000 of them in New York
City alone. It is a disease of those peoples
who value plumbing, sanitation, and the
hygienic preparation of food, those very
things which are a national mark of a
high standard of living and which control
so many other epidemic infections. In
1921 Franklin D. Roosevelt contracted
polio and the influence of this was far-
reaching, leading in 1938 to the creation
of the National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis, perhaps the most famous and
controversial private charity ever known.
In the years to come it was to collect
630 million dollars. Perhaps, as Dr Wil-
son says, it will stand for ever as a
monument to what ruthless and energetic
fund-raising can do, for good or evil, if
allowed to run riot.
Today, polio vaccination is a reality.
The Americans succeeded, there will be
further improvements, and we all benefit.
Success justifies a lot. This wide-awake
book shows how that success was
achieved.

old man’s head emerges from a
A bulky fisherman’s sweater. On the
crown perches a red pixie cap. From
beneath heavy brows, the eyes focus on
a page of print through gold-rimmed
spectacles. The index finger of the right
hand rests lightly and ambiguously on
the lips. The portrait of Sean O’Casey
on this book’s cover is in many ways an
accurate signpost to the essays that lie
within. They never allow us to forget
O’Casey’s working-class-background and
his continued allegiance to popular
ideals. They are full of puckishly im-
pudent jibes at all sorts of conventional
beliefs. Both fierceness and elegance
mark the writing, which reveals the
deepest beliefs of a long life but enjoins
no one to secrecy.
O'Casey describes Part Two of the
title essay as “a reverie” and the descrip-
tion is exact. But these musings have not
been set down simply for their author’s
private delight. At one and the same
time they turn inward to the writer and
outward to the world. They turn in on
O'Casey’s own beliefs and experiences
for their subject matter; they turn out
in their often aggressive rhetoric, their
undisguised intention to persuade.
The chief subjects of “Under a
Colored Cap” have long preoccupied
O’Casey. There are three of them:
religion, literature, and (especially by
way of the theatre) the relationship be-
tween culture and community. Essays
like “Immanuel” and “Merrical of
Miracles” represent a sustained and
bitterly hostile rejection of any kind of
supernatural religion and, in particular,
of Christian doctrine. O’Casey finds
Christianity irrational, unverifiable, and,
in its practices, socially and psychologi-
cally repressive. His critique is sometimes
that of a naively rational materialist; it
recalls the atheist heckler encountered
by George Orwell in “Down and Out in
Paris and London”, who sought to dis-
comfort his opponent with such ques-
tions as "Can you show me God? ’Ave
you touched ’im? ’Ave you shook ’ands
with ’ini?”
O'Casey’s own position is perhaps most
soberly stated in these words: “My
mind,” said Edison the scientist, “is un-
able to conceive of such a thing as a
soul. I may be in error, and man may
have a soul, but I simply cannot believe
it. Nor can I, though, God knows, I
have many reasons for desiring it to be
true . . .” For O’Casey, man’s most
important (and probably only) business
is to live successfully here and now. To
do so involves meeting the world with
the full resources of the body, which
houses the senses as well as the mind.
O’Casey aligns himself with those
writers who, even in registering the
bitterness and forror of the world, could
still raise a cheer for the beauty of
human Jife: Shakespeare, the Elizabethan
dramatists, Milton, Keats, Tennyson,
Whitman. He places a high value on
popular literature, the strong and im-
mediate appeal of folk art: “ ‘Lambeth
Walk’, ‘Boomps-a-Daisy’ or ‘The Blarney
Groves’ have a place in our lives as deep
as the Parthenon, Westminster Abbey or
Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’.” In O'Casey’s
eyes, literature should not belong to a
highly cultured elite, but should be the
property of the people.
“There is happiness in things done,”
he writes in “The Green Crow Caws,”
“in the fixing of a fuse, the cooking of
a meal, the hanging of a door . . .
These in their simpler ways are as
triumphant as the creation of art in any
form, and it is by these gifts that we
live, move, and have our being.”
Such an unscientific belief in the joy
and goodness of fundamental human
experience is the unargued (and perhaps
unarguable) axiom by which O’Casey
lives and writes. It is an axiom which
sustains all the other views expressed in
“Under a Colored Cap.”

Bargaining with Japan
Blunt Economic Facts Must Be Faced
The Minister for Trade (Mr McEwen), now in Tokyo,
is eagerly ready to put the finishing touches on Aus-
tralia’s trade treaty with Japan. Mr McEwen’s visit
culminates discussions which have been proceeding, in almost
complete secrecy, since last November.
Practically no leakages and certainly no official pronounce-
ments gave any hints about the tenor of the preliminary talks.
Everybody remotely interested just realised that commercial
relations between the two countries had changed fantastically
since the old agreement was negotiated in 1957.
That general situation, however, could not be the only
factor determining a
new treaty. Even dur-
ing the currency of
the Canberra meetings
Australia’s principal
customer, the United
Kingdom, did not gain
a desired admittance
to the European Com-
mon Market.
More recently an
assembly of GATT
signatories has pointed
up profoundly altering
conceptions of world
trade, especially for
under-developed areas.
Then, too, the great
trading nations face
next year the “Ken-
nedy Round” calling
for considerable linear
cuts in their tariff
structure.
In the face of all
those complications,
Mr McEwen managed
to sound remarkably
optimistic before his
departure. “I do not foresee any stumbling blocks,” he said.
“Accord has already been reached on most matters set down.”
Mr McEwen also confirmed the widely recognised impres-
sion that existing relationships between Australia and Japan
are harmonious and considerate. “Japanese businessmen accept
that they have to trade without harming Australian industry,”
he said.
In very bare detail the new treaty is to deal with the
export of wool, sugar, coal, wheat and other agricultural
produce to Japan in return for industrial products which do
not clash with Australian industry.
That latter phrase emphasises one of the cruxes so far as
Australia is concerned. Beyond all the platitudes of this
country’s increasing direction towards Asia, a major primary
producer (for the present treaty) has to negotiate with a major
Australia’s Trade with Japan and the Commonwealth
The diagrams above illustrate the changing pattern of Australia’s trade
with Japan and all Commonwealth countries. Both exports and imports are
shown as percentages of total exports and total imports for the years con-
cerned.
Since the first Japanese trade treaty was signed in 1957, overall trade
with Japan has increased; that with Commonwealth countries has fallen.
industrialist and at the same time not place its own growing
industry in hazard.
There is no need to reiterate Japan’s industrial stature. It
has become more striking and more ambitious since 1957,
to say the least.
Japan is now the world’s largest shipbuilder and manu-
facturer of motorcycles; the second largest maker of bearings,
cameras, radios and television sets; the fourth biggest pro-
ducer of steel, machine tools and pharmaceuticals; the fifth
largest car maker. A sophisticated bunch to deploy on an
export drive and to make some impact on an adverse balance-
of-payments situation.
It’s just as well that
Japan remains continu-
ally hungry for raw
materials for our
main export commod-
ity, wool —and that a
rising standard of liv-
ing appears likely to
encourage a greater de-
mand for some of our
food products.
These blunt economic
facts must above all, in
the forthcoming treaty,
accommodate them-
selves to . a modified
joint trading pattern.
Australia cannot simply
repeat that the stars
in their courses are
turning Japan into a
best customer.
The accompanying
diagrams show clearly
how much the pattern
of trade is moving away
from our traditional
Commonwealth part-
ners. If it also shows the accelerating importance of Japan,
it equally demonstrates Japan’s plainly adverse balance in
respect of Australia.
Mr McEwen possesses a thoroughly rational explanation:
“No one can expect a country of 11 million people to buy as
much as a country of 92 million. Further, the raw materials
Australia sends Japan produce employment, while the manu-
factured goods which Japan sends Australia are liable to
run into conflict with employment here.”
The Japanese, within their tactful consideration, may appre-
ciate the full weight of those observations, yet must at the
same time urge somewhat relaxed entry conditions for
manufactures.
Australia has obviously to meet the request and this time
without the benefit of the notorious GATT Clause 35 permit-


ting unilateral discrimination against Japan. Japan is inter-
nationally respectable, without a doubt. Indeed, on the verge
of Mr McEwen’s trip it was admitted as the first Asian
member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. A “liberalisation” policy, in spite of internal
stresses, has paid off once more.
Nothing in Japan’s destined customer status with Australia
can absolve us from continuously chasing export trade, par-
ticularly for industrial products, wherever and whenever it is
available. The Bulletin has previously mentioned that in
many places throughout Asia Australia will find Japan a
tenacious and efficient rival. An export drive is many-pronged.
Whatever recompense the Japanese treaty brings for our
declining European trade must never convince us to lean
heavily on one major partner, big though its appetite for
primary commodities will be. Miraculous growth economies
are still subject to recession and the related unwillingness to
import. The risks have always to be spread.
Last year’s Japanese recession did strike those very in-
dustries highly dependent on imported raw materials, such
as steel, non-ferrous metals and textiles. As the treaty nears
completion it is good to learn from the latest White Paper
published by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
that Japan’s overall dependence on imports is rising.
The White Paper is really worth a separate examination.
At this juncture it is well to know the general trade outlook
is regarded as fairly favorable. Overall, Japan hopes to earn
more than it spends a deficit on trade account receiving
compensation from capital incomings.
Under this kind of climate Australia must push every ad-
vantage possible its closeness in respect of coal and iron
ore, for example. Both these commodities face, many rival
suppliers, so the bargains will be driven hard.
The news of near-resolution of the treaty talks sounds very
good. Its importance cannot be exaggerated. But it does not
allow us to cheer the lessening significance of erstwhile major
customers. Even with the way Commonwealth trade appears
to be going, there’s a little matter of New Zealand and all the
old mechanism of mutual protection which may soon call for
extremely close attention.
How To Develop
A State
A week or two ago The Bulletin remarked that Hamersley
Holdings, the Conzinc Riotinto-Kaiser Steel iron ore com-
bine, could be pressing the Western Australian Government
towards an agreement on the capacious Pilbara deposits. As
things have turned out some of the boot may have been on the
other foot.
In recent years the Government has vigorously chased every
prospect that smacked of development. The State’s iron ore
resources have enabled it to play this particular hand from very
strong trumps.
With Hamersley a bargain has been driven which, if it. goes
all the way, finishes up by giving WA “the basis of a second
steel industry for Australia”, as the Acting-Premier (Mr C. N.
Nalder) puts it.
A quite conscious governmental aim was “firstly to clear the
way for the financing of development by encouraging exports;
secondly, to build into our agreements a requirement for up-
grading or other processing that will increase local employment
and add value to our exports; thirdly, to create a setting for
full-scale industrial development that will give us maximum
employment and economic value from our mineral deposits.”
Naturally the time scale is fairly extensive. WA might not
see the beginnings of iron and steel production from Hamersley
until 1992! But the programme has been laid down.
Should the company not reach the upgrading or steelmaking
stage “the Government has the right to seek other companies
to take over and, then, to terminate the agreement. If the
agreement is terminated, all the company’s fixed assets in the
area associated with the project become the property of the
State, without compensation.”
Agreement details also go into conditions governing iron ore
shipments to other Australian States—not to exceed one ton
for every two tons processed in WA. Coke or coking coal
must come from these other States: “there is an economic need
for the ships that bring it over to backload with iron ore.”
Many years and an estimated minimum £7B million ex-
penditure must pass before the integrated iron and steel industry
is attained. But Hamersley itself recognises the scheme as a
natural step in economic development.
By the way, the sharemarkets have taken kindly to their
local contact in the move. CRA, The Bulletin’s “stock of the
year’ for 1963, has been moving up lately and won even
further attention.
Used Cars Match New
In Spending
appear to spend just about the same amount
on used cars as they do on new cars. We always thought
that the new car market was bigger.
But figures given by the Commonwealth Statistician since
July, 1961, show that there is not too large a difference
between the respective markets provided that cash sales
are much the same.
And, on examination, cash sales would be fairly equal
when greater unit sales in the used market are equated with
the higher prices on cash sales in the new car market.
Anyhow, finance sought on the two markets gives a slight
edge to the used car market.

Mr W. Corner, of Coorparoo, Brisbane, who makes bagpipes
from kangaroo hide, is developing an export trade for them
and a Scottish piper, using one of his bags, has won a piping
contest in Scotland.
Mr Corner makes about 250 bags a year, according to the

A Case Against the
Restrictive Trade Bill
No.2 Expansive private enterprise should be free
By ROGER RANDERSON
SIR GARFIELD
As a minimum requirement for the
support of Parliament and the
electorate, the Federal Attorney-
General should have to prove that
private enterprise in general is failing
to serve the public —in their over-
lapping capacities as employees, con-
sumers and investors. Unless he can
do this, there is obviously no case for
his elaborate scheme to create a new
bureaucracy for restricting business
activities.
It is significant that neither Sir Gar-
field Barwick nor anyone else has
made a satisfactory attempt to provide
this elementary justification for a vast
extension of administrative powers.
For reasons that I intend to indicate,
he would find it impossible to do so.
Australian private enterprise is func-
tioning as well as can be expected, and
has no reason to be ashamed of its
record.
In passing, it should be noted that
even if the existence of widespread evils
requiring correction could be demon-
strated, Parliament would still need to
be satisfied on further points before
authorising the proposed scheme.
Would the Barwick plan, in fact,
eliminate or substantially reduce so-
called restrictive practices and monopo-
lisation? Would it do so without
destructive side-effects from a proposed
cure which is worse than the disease?
These are practical questions to which
no convincing answers have come from
official sources or zealous academics.
Australia’s private industries, taken
as a whole, have a productive per-
formance that is quite beyond challenge,
when all the handicaps imposed on them
are taken into account. Such handicaps
include high and rising labor costs and
Budgetary and monetary restraints.
There is absolutely nothing in the
Barwick scheme to encourage the
private enterprise system as a whole to
improve its productive performance.
It is a proft and loss system —not, as
some critics innocently believe, simply
a profit system. Profit is the incentive
to improve efficiency and increase out-
put, while loss is the penalty for failure.
The fact that many businesses operate
for long periods at a loss while stepping
up their production is too often over-
looked. Business failures involve some
social losses, but they are far more off-
set in the long run by the release of
capital, labor and other resources for
more profitable and productive pur-
poses.
HThe significant truth is that Australian
A industries, whether operating at
profits or losses, increase their total out-
put of goods and services year after
year. This occurred in recent years even
after official action had been taken to
repress private business activities.
Statistically-minded people can check
this by reference to the increases in the
gross national product during 1960-61
and 1961-62, small though they were,
and the increase of almost eight per
cent in 1962-63.
ROGER RANDERSON, author of
this the second of a series of
articles on the proposed Federal
legislation on Restrictive Trade
Practices and Monopolies, has been
for many years a leading financial
journalist and economist. Mr
Randerson recently resigned as
editorial adviser on economic
affairs to the “Sydney Morning
Herald’’ to resume legal practice.
There is nothing restrictive about the
productive performance of Australian
private enterprise. But the proposed
scheme would be grossly restrictive of
private business decisions designed to
avoid wastes of capital and other re-
sources, including human skills, as
stabilising factors to swell production
in the long run.
Prices are a fertile ground for
economic fallacies, and most of the
requests from seemingly learned quarters
for this kind of legislation are based on
shallow theories of the relationship of
prices to highly complex business pro-
cesses. In some instances, it is also re-
grettable to note, wishful ignorance is
even coupled with malevolence towards
a free society because of inevitable
human inequalities.
/Contrary to popular misunderstand-
ings, Australian private enterprise is
steadily making goods and services
cheaper to buy. This statement may
appear startling at first sight. Never-
theless, it is correct. For almost any
product that can be named an ever-
decreasing part of a man’s working time
is needed to obtain the spending power
to pay for it.
Recognition of this truth is largely
obscured because the post-war increases
in money wages and in paid leisure time
have exceeded additions to the nation’s
productiveness.
Money prices must reflect such ad-
ditions to the costs of production. Yet
the money price of most goods has
increased less than the rise in labor
costs during recent years. Some goods
have been reduced in price despite the
rise in labor costs. The prices of many
more have been held steady with
marked improvement in quality, packag-
ing and servicing—which is equivalent
to reduction in prices.
Herein lies one of the great and in-
adequately acknowledged achievements
of Australian private enterprise. Some
of the benefit from the investment of
large amounts of capital has been passed
on to the consumer to offset the rise in
labor costs partially. Obviously, before
this can be done the major part of the
earnings of this additional capital must
go in meeting the costs of interest, main-

Consumers have received some of the
offset to rising labor costs from wide-
spread unremitting efforts to improve
methods of production, and from efforts
to increase the market by exporting.
Careful researches by the IPA, Vic-
toria, show the cheapening of goods in
terms of labor effort between 1950 and
1961. I quote a few of their examples
in support of previous statements.
The average adult male employee in
1961 (receiving 10s. an hour compared
with 4s. 6d. an hour in 1950) could
buy a refrigerator with the earnings
from 220 hours of work, whereas he
needed to work 600 hours for the same
purpose 1 1 years before. A “Holden”
motor car had been cheapened from
3770 work hours in 1950 to 2210 in
1961.
Less Work Buys More
The table below gives further
examples of the cheapening of
goods in terms of labor effort re-
ferred to in the text. Whatever
the rise in prices has been, the
average employee is clearly better
off than 10 years ago. Private
enterprise is doing its job.

Any allegations that the consumer is
being exploited are ridiculous in the
light of these figures. Such allegations
are often supported by reference to
arbitrary notions as to “reasonable”
levels of profit. This, however, is quite
irrelevant to the present discussion.
Even if it were relevant, one could point
to the undoubted “profit squeeze” of
recent years. Abundant evidence is
available from the Stock Exchange
annual report and from national income
white papers and Reserve Bank publica-
tions to show that the average return
on capital resources has fallen drastically
in recent years.
Those economists and lawyers who
fail to acknowledge the above un-
deniable facts —especially the cheapen-
ing of goods in terms of working time
•—and advocate the proposed legislation
on the ground that prices are excessive
should tremble at the support they are
thus giving to dangerous demagogues.
Sir Garfield Barwick does not fall
within the latter category. It is un-
fortunate that he has ventured too far
into an unfamiliar field, after his
immense achievements in directing the
introduction of uniform Australian laws
concerning marriage, divorce and com-
panies. He has there proved his states-
man-like quality.
Even in his present dubious proposals
the saving grace of the Attorney-General
is that he has actually invited the
criticisms here expressed.

appear next week.]
Ford Foundation’s
Research Grant
HThe Committee for Economic Develop-
A ment of Australia (CEDA) has been
given a strong shot in the arm by the
grant of 75,000 dollars from the Ford
Foundation (New York) to carry out
special research, discussions and inter-
national exchanges as a prelude to mak-
ing recommendations on Australia’s role
in development assistance and trade pro-
grammes in Asia.
The project now under notice will be
carried out in close co-operation with
the American Committee for Economic
Development (CED) and also Keizai
Dokuyaki, the equivalent organisation in
Japan.
Though the project may seem rather
far reaching to some people, this is how
CEDA sees its role and the hope will be
that solid recommendations on trade
(especially trade) and aid will come out
of it. It may be hoped also that CEDA
doesn’t regard this effort as a part-time
job.
Two of CEDA’s main research studies,
“Investment in the Public Sector” being
done by Professor Russell Mathews and
“Australia’s Export Potential” by Mr
D. H. Merry, are said to be well advanc-
ed. These form part of a central pro-
gramme of six projects embracing the
whole of Australia’s economic problems.
The other four are “Private Investment
and its Contribution to Economic
Growth”, “Tariff Policy and Procedures”,
“Population Growth and the Age Dis-
tribution”, and “Wages Policy and Pro-
ductivity.”
While these will all be published as
studies, the intention is to
draw from Them a final survey of the
basic economic policy required to pro-
duce a rate of growth appropriate to the
circumstances of the Australian economy.
Presumably, this is what the Govern-
ment’s own economic inquiry also will
be doing. What a pity the two committees
are not working together!


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Economy on Budget Eve
An Uneasy Sort of Balance
Tn bygone days “balance” was synony-
mous for a satisfactory state of
affairs pertaining both in the economy
and in Federal finances. Indeed, even
these days many people would not think
a Federal Treasurer reactionary if he
preened himself for having restored the
economy to an even keel, balanced his
Budget and added a tidy sum to over-
seas funds.
But to an increasing number of
people in recent years mere “equilib-
rium” has become synonymous with
“stagnation” a dirty word almost.
To them the question of balance is
secondary to expansion. They want the
economy to be going full steam ahead
and, if necessary, with a Budget deficit
to match. Last year’s increase in the
national product, they say, should not
be mistaken for expansion, but is to
be explained simply as recovery.
Basically, of course, this is the old
conflict between classical and Keynesian
economics, the one fixing its sights on
equilibrium irrespective of the degree
of employment of available economic
resources, and the other seeing the
main objective as the full employment
of resources.
/"In the eve of the Budget the Australian
economy is as near to balance
in the classical sense as the die-hards
could reasonably hope for and the Key-
nesians might despair about. For in-
stance, take the traditional measure of
the level of prices. Although an increase
of .7 p.c. in consumer prices (all groups
weighted average of six capitals) over the
last year shows that we have moved out
of the price deflation of the year before,
when consumer prices (1952-53=100)
actually dropped from 125 to 124, even
after the rise last year, prices in the
latest June quarter were still .2 points
below the level of June, 1961.
Admittedly this result is somewhat
deceptive as a guide to what may be
immediately ahead on the score of
prices. For one thing, price equilibrium
last year owed a lot to special factors,
because a rise of 7-8 p.c. in gross
national product in one year would nor-
mally be associated with rising pres-
sure on prices. In fact, the income to
exert such pressure was big enough, but
to a great extent was offset by the low
propensity to spend maintained almost
throughout the year in fact, the
propensity to spend seemed to shade a
little after the effect of the concentrated
tax reliefs (March-June, 1962) and
tax rebates wore off and the Treasurer,
embarrassed by the response to his loans,
withdrew the stimulus he promised in
the last Budget to the economy and which
it needed from public sector investment
and spending.
As well as these two main influences
weakening the impact of rising (mainly
from wages) private sector incomes on
prices, several others associated with
the recovery process played an import-
ant part, notably intense competition in
industry and trade, a ready inflow of
imports, rising stocks and a universal
reluctance in business to let go pro-
ductivity gains by spending more freely
on less essential items.
All these forces operated throughout
the year with the exception of imports,
which became patchy once the follow-
through to the recovery failed to mat-
erialise. Imports have not yet signalled
the long awaited economic expansion.
(June imports of £90.5 million this year
were the lowest for three months).
It is conceivable, of course, that last
year’s moderate .7 p.c. rise in con-
sumer prices (concentrated mostly in
the second half of the year) though quite
understandable in the light of the above
influences, marks the end of the road
for price equilibrium. But, even with
current wage rises stemming from the
metal trades’ margins award, this could
be a wrong reading. These wage in-
creases will certainly have a cost-push
influence and so a depressing one on
the economy, but without an increase in
the propensity to spend they could have
only a very marginal effect on con-
sumer prices.
For all that, the state of our over-
seas accounts is equally as impressive
as the stability of prices. Though we
had a deficit of £214 million on current
account in the year to June last, a £2BB
million surplus of net apparent capital
inflow enabled us to add £65 million
to our international reserves and con-
tribute a further £l2 million to the In-
ternational Monetary Fund.
On the other hand, for all the basic
strength of the position, the Keynesians,
looking at the glaring evidence of un-
employed resources labor, capital and
industrial capacity, the huge pile of
overseas funds and so on say that
f in putting a premium on stability Mr
Holt has missed the boat of opportunity.
In his turn the Treasurer could say
that he intends to go all out for ex-
pansion from now on, and that he ha*
the necessary ammunition in unem-
ployed resources to ensure success.

he could usher into use is uncomfort-
ably imposing. For a start, there are
about 80,000 unemployed and a great
deal of unused industrial capacity. We
have not made much of a dent in either of
these two over the last year. Admittedly
the absorption of school-leavers and new
migrants was accomplished satisfactorily
and, also, substantial new additions were
made to industrial capacity; but taking
the latest (June) figures we still seem
to be stuck on both these fronts.
For apart from the stickiness of em-
ployment, production suffered a setback
in June (25 out of 35 of the Common-
wealth Statistician’s groups falling) after
having levelled off in the previous three
months. How much higher it is now
compared with the level this time last
year is problematical, though it cannot
be much more than 4 p.c.
/"In the other hand, the provisional June
statistics from the Commonwealth
Statistician show that in 14 of the in-
dustrial groups production was below
the June level of the year before, the
main laggards being durable consump-
tion goods, textiles (except man-made
fibres) and such things as beer, con-
fectionery and tobacco. That is evidence
enough of the continued tightness of
consumer spending.
Although the figures for stocks move-
ments for the full year are not yet avail-
able, going on the rise of <£ll9 million
in non-farm stocks in the first three-
quarters of the year compared with a
net drop £5l million in these stocks
in the same period the previous year,
it is quite apparent that a sizeable part
of the increase in production last year
was for the re-building of stocks in the
expectation of a big spurt in consumer
buying, which, as it turned out, has
not eventuated.
It could happen, therefore, that with-
out the necessary revival in retail spend-
ing to encourage new orders, and in-
dustry being reluctant to add further
to its stocks, production could slip back
further.
So, while a rundown of the physical
elements in the economic picture re-
veals a balance, it is an uneasy sort of
balance. Without considerable financial
help from the Budget the scales could
very easily tip the wrong way. It is to
be hoped therefore that Mr Holt means
what he says in pre-Budget messages
that he is going for expansion this
time and sticks firmly to his intentions
throughout the year, unless, of course,
his Budget is so expansionary that he
finds a consumption boom on his hands
not impossible, but hardly likely on
his previous Budget showings.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Learning from History?
What the auditors saw in Reid Murray
Tt may sound peculiarly unsympathetic
but The Bulletin once more repeats
that further inner details of the Reid
Murray collapse, released last week, still
possess mostly an historical interest.
A welter of receiverships, special in-
vestigations and now an acutely worded
auditors’ report make only too clear the
sorry fate of shareholders and other in-
vestors. They also leave the matter of
possible recourse still looking somewhat
vague.
If all these probings do eventually lead
to obvious amendments in the Companies
Acts, the agony will give genuine and
lasting commercial compensations. Even
that benefit, like the complete resolution
of Reid Murray’s exact position, is going
to. take a long, long time.
Such a pessimistic conclusion must not
be allowed for one moment to detract
from the efficient and surgical job per-
formed by auditors Fuller, King and Co.
The firm speedily overcame various legal
hindrances delaying the separate release
of their report. Though actual publica-
tion was of necessity limited, shareholders
are advised to seize every opportunity to
examine Fuller, King's observations.
They will perhaps continue to boggle
at a situation where the belatedly dis-
closed loss for 1961-62, £5,386,425, does
not bring the last word on earnings, or
the lack of them.
“The loss for the year in the con-
solidated statement of profit and loss is
understated.
“But because of the inadequacy of the
accounting records of Reid Murray
Acceptance Ltd., and the lack of evidence
as to the value of certain of the lands and
other property of Payne’s Properties Pty.
Ltd., it is not possible to determine the
amount of the misstatements.
“Because of the items which are in-
correctly stated, the consolidated balance
sheet and consolidated statement of profit
and loss do not give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the group or of
the results of its operations for the year,”
Fuller, King qualifies.
For a proper glimpse of affairs as a
whole, it surely cannot mean much that
some items “are in accordance with the
provisions of the 9th Schedule of the
Companies Act, 1961, and are truly and
fairly stated as at August 31, 1962.”
The old menace of questionable inter-
the world of business
"Problem solved! We've just discovered that our brand name is a rude
word in five Asian languages."

company accounts and indeterminate
assets valuation crops up again. To cap if
all, “of the 218 subsidiary companies and
partnerships, 185 were reported on by
other auditors.”
A regular friend, “instalment debtors
and the related provision for unearned
income,” also puts in yet another appear-
ance. The provisions “were incorrectly
stated and the profit for the year was
incorrect.”
Reform of such technical details, and
the establishment of adequate standards,
are probably well within the immediate
capacity of the auditing profession and
governments. Possible moves should not
be avoided by either group.
From the Fuller, King report share-
holders will doubtless seize upon sundry
deals made through the use of the Payne's
Properties subsidiary and the family
companies of erstwhile director Mr. R. L.
Borg. They can learn too about previously
unknown commissions to executives, tied
to profits.
It’s all historical. We've passed this
way before.
Professor Kenneth Galbraith’s book
“The Great Crash 1929” could be allow-
ed to have the last word and draw a
risky moral:
“So some day, no one can tell when,
there will be another speculative climax
and crash. There is no chance that, as
the market moves to the brink, those
involved will see the nature of their
illusion and so protect themselves and
the system.
v “The mad can communicate their
madness; they cannot perceive it and
resolve to be sane.
“There is some protection so long as
there are people who know, when they
hear it said that history is being made
in this market or that a new era has been
opened, that the same history has been
made and the same new eras have been
opened many, many times before. This
acts to arrest the spread of illusion.”
Doubt Over Retailers
There's more than one investor who
A considers the current level of about
225. for David Jones shares is top-
heavy. Several put options have been
taken out lately.
Puts, which are far outnumbered by
calls, have also been taken out on Mark
Foys at Bs. 9d. and Anthony Horderns
at 13s.
Paper Progress
A 28 p.c. uplift in Australian Paper
Manufacturers’ profitability brought
a record result for the year to June 30.
Earning rate on the bonus-inflated
capital increased marginally from 11,9
p.c. to 12.2 p.c., and dividend is again
8i p.c.
Tax provision was almost £i million
higher, and depreciation was also greater.
APM’s pleasing news closely followed
a report from Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills Ltd that all its mills were running
at full production, and demand was good.
Associated's results for the year to
June are not usually published until the
end of August.
A Move Foreshadowed
TJ. G. Palmer, under MLC’s roof, is
tidying up its household by offering
to buy out shareholdings in Hire Pur-
chase Securities Ltd for 75., the recent
market price. The possibility of such a
move was suggested in The Bulletin
a few weeks ago.
Hire Purchase Securities considered
expanding its operations beyond the
Palmer organisation, but believed
profitability would fall in today’s com-
petitive conditions, without bank or in-
stitutional affiliation.
As Palmer can now borrow at much
lower rates it could no longer continue
to feed business to HP Securities.

Tin Snags
A rdlethan Tin seems to have run
into an unexpected snag with the
cost of its pipeline from the Murrum-
bidgee, originally estimated at £BO,OOO.
Northern Riverina County Council en-
gineers now place the cost at £151,620
and a statement from the company is
awaited.
Meanwhile, world tin prices give
every appearance of settling at quite
high levels again after shock reactions to
Washington’s decision to step up sales
from official stockpiles. At the time of
writing, the spot mid-price has gone
to £stg. 8951 a ton.
Overseas sources agree that Wash-
ington most likely will allow prices to
range between £stg. 850 and £stg. 910,
regarding the latter as an absolute ceil-
ing. This range represents the middle
sector of the International Tin Agree-
ment’s price structure. The position must
still be influenced by current consump-
tion demands, which continue well ahead
of current output.
Producers complain that prices be-
low £stg.9lo a ton make it uneconomic
to seek new deposits. Ardlethan’s com-
ments would be interesting.
No Freeze Here

Holdings can hardly express its confid-
ence more openly than by the just
completed bonus issue. The present 10s.
shares are to be split into ss. units and
shareholders given one new share for
every two held on July 26.
With the popular motor lines, as well
as agencies for tractors, farm machinery
and Lambretta vehicles, the company
must feel nicely situated in an up-and-
coming State. Directors give no sense
of rushing their fences in venturing upon
a bonus so soon after last year’s recovery
from drooping 1960-61 results.
For 1961-62 earning rate was lifted
from 7.1 to 19.8 p.c. A 10 p.c. dividend
has been paid since 1958. Apparently
this rate should be held, since directors
believe the higher capital can be “satis-
factorily serviced”. Earnings to June 30
could provide a reasonably accurate
guide.
The bonus takes £-225,000 from a
£242,012 share premium reserve, resi-
dual of a one-for-two cash issue made
in 1955. Those shares were issued at
100 p.c. premium.
Recent sales have been around 235.
“Steels” the Limelight
A one-for-five bonus now dis-
tinguishes William Atkins Hold-
ings Ltd from run-of-the-mill steel and
aluminium distributors.
Others may have stalled during the
“squeeze” period, but this company
braked only slightly and almost all of the
ground lost in the last two years has
now been recovered.
Profit for the year to June 30, 1963,
of £90,911 compares with the 1959-60
peak of £95,319.
William Atkins has made only one
faux pas in its public history, and that
was in 1953-54 when the trade suffered
a severe depression.
Bonus, from share premium reserve
created by issues to shareholders and
others for assets, will bring capital to a
manageable £600,000. (The last bonus
was a one-for-two in January, 1959.)
News of William Atkins’ prosperity
follows that from William Adams a few
weeks back. Others in the industry to
report this month are J. Blackwood
and Son, Brambles, and Martin Bright
Steels.

ONE TO BUY
A Consistent
Woolbroker
As Mr McEwen is currently in Japan
to sign a new trade agreement, the
accent today is on the export of primary
products. The investor’s motto could well
be “back to basics”.
Choice of “One to Buy”, therefore,
falls this week on the Geelong wool-
broker and stock and station agent,
Dennys Lascelles Ltd.
Handling about 2.6 p.c. cf the 1961-62
wool clip, Dennys is way behind the
recently amalgamated giants Elder Smith-
Goldsborough Mort and Dalgety NZ
Loan, but this does not worry the man-
agement.
In fact, at the 1962 annual meeting
the chairman made the point that these
firms had effected mergers to eliminate
overlapping of costs, but Dennys was a
small firm trading in a restricted and
safe area, and could see few if any ad-
vantages for Dennys shareholders in a
merger.
Directors were convinced there was
plenty of room for the small woolbroker.
The 1962 profit of £139,008, giving
an earning rate of 18.1 p.c., is the second
highest on record. Dividend has been
hoisted from 12i p.c. to 14 p.c. The final
payment of 10 p.c. (2s. per share)
includes 4 p.c. bonus.
The company is especially strong in
the rich western district of Victoria, and
also serves the northern part of the State
and the Riverina, areas where the rain
is more reliable than most sheep country
in Australia.
This is reflected in the consistency of
the company’s earnings performance
over the years—the only loss in the last
35 years was in 1931.
In good years, shareholders are more
generously treated by the company, but
dividends have been at a minimum rate
of 11 p.c. in the last 16 years.
There have also been three par issues
in the post-war period the last a two-for-
five in 1961.
Australia’s wool cheque for the year to
June 30, 1963, was 6 p.c. higher than in
1961-62, although receipts came from a
smaller disposal. In 1963-64 wool pro-
duction is expected to ne another 6 p.c.
higher in quantity terms.
The stage seems set for another ex-
cellent year by woolbrokers, and Dennys
Lascelles would be an excellent repre-
sentative in anyone’s portfolio.
The 20s. shares are widely quoted in
Melbourne at 555. 6d. buyer, 60s. seller,
and the last sale at 555. 9d. yielded 5.0
p.c. on the new dividend. The investor
would be justified in going to 625. to
secure a holding.

Profit Prospects of
the MLC
A purchase of MLC 20s. shares now
at £7 4s. Od. gives an income
yield of 1.8 p.c., and earnings yield of
3.2 p.c. If earnings accelerate the way
a leading Sydney sharebroker figures,
current purchase will give an earnings
yield of 4.4 p.c. in 1968.
In an analysis of the company, this
sharebroker projected earnings for the
next six years. At his most conservative
estimate, earning rate on capital of
£3,636,213 would be 31.5 p.c. in 1968,
and perhaps as high as 34.4 p.c.
Basic assumptions for the minimum
projection were:
© An annual increase of 10 p.c.
in profit from the ordinary and indus-
trial branch of The Mutual Life and
Citizens’ Assurance;
® Allocation of 2i p.c. in 1963 and
2i p.c. thereafter from the ordinary
branch surplus, to MLC shareholders.
© Allocation of 3.5 p.c. for the next
two years, 3.0 p.c. for the following
two years, and 2i p.c. in 1967 and
1968, from the industrial branch sur-
plus to MLC shareholders;
© A steady surplus of £200,000
from the general branch.
A dissertation on life assurance in
Australia is included in the broker’s
brochure. It draws attention to the
10 p.c. annual rate of growth in prem-
iums received, and decides that so long
as the Government continues to recog-
nise premiums as personally tax deduct-
ible, the life assurance business will
grow at least at this rate in future.
It has been calculated that H. G.
Palmer will earn an extra £125,000
profit for every 1 p.c. reduction in the
cost of borrowing under the MLC um-
brella, and it is obvious the Palmer
profit will grow by natural progression.
But for the purpose of this exercise, the
broker estimated Palmer’s 1968 profit
at a most conservative £548,104.
Taking the dimmest view possible,
MLC’s profit must reach £1,145,000
by 1968.
The analyst pointed out The MLC
had 363,787 20s. shares left for take-
over purposes before it needed to seek
shareholders’ permission, so similarly
lucrative acquisitions might be made.
An offer for Hire Purchase Securities
Ltd has since been made for a cash
consideration.
MLC shares are essentially a lock-
away proposition, and therefore hard to
come by. The Palmer takeover has,
however, freed scrip for quantity in-
vestment by newcomers attracted by the
considerable enhancement of MLC’s
profit prospects.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Big Scope for a Small Company
HThe stock market is always slow in
recognising, via appropriate share
price movements, the good performances
of the smaller listed companies, since the
reasoning 1 seems to be that a favorable
result is just as likely to be followed by
an adverse result, especially if the com-
pany is operating in an industry noted for
its instability (quite apart from the size
factor).
This is indeed the position as regards
Burns Consolidated Ltd, a company
operating in the textile industry, which, of
course, has never been a stock market
“favorite” industry.
Burns’ history as a public company
dates from the beginning of the 1957-
58 financial year when the shell of Aus-
tralian Wood Pipe Co. Ltd was acquired.
This latter company had made losses in
13 of its last 30 years of activity, and,
following a resolution made in Novem-
ber, 1957, all assets of the company re-
lating to concrete and wood stove pipes
were disposed of, shortly after the pre-
sent directors joined the board.
On January 8, 1958, the name of the
company was changed to its present form
and approval was given for the company,
to acquire the whole of the issued capi-
tal of Burns Dye Works Pty Ltd, a
company principally engaged in textile
dyeing and enjoying successful trading.
As a result of these changes a small
profit of £1984 was earned for the year
ended June 30, 1958, by Burns Con-
solidated Ltd and its subsidiaries. How-
ever, as a trading loss of £4939 was sus-
tained up to the date of the discontinu-
ance of the concrete and wood stove
pipes activities, this means that the textile
dyeing company made a profit of
£6923 which, on paid-up capital at that
time of £37,600, represented an earning
rate of 18.4 p.c. per annum.
following financial year, the first
full year of trading since the acquisi-
tion of Burns Dye Works, the aggregate
net profit for the year was £9,120, or
24.2 p.c. on paid-up ordinary capital,
though the consolidated profit and loss
account still had a (now reduced) debit
balance and no taxation had to be paid
before arriving at the year’s profit.
In the boom 1959-60 financial year,
the company earned 52.7 p.c. on year-
end ordinary capital, still partly aided by
a light taxation provision. Although the
consolidated profit and loss account now
had a credit balance of £15,728, no
ordinary dividend was yet paid in view
of the period necessary to consolidate
the new activities.
In addition to serving the Australian
textile industry in the dyeing of various
yarns, for the first time in the 1960-61
years the company, through its other
subsidiary, Burns Distributors Pty Ltd,
acted as sole distributor for the acrylic
yarn under the name of “Cashmilon”
which is manufactured in Japan.
The importance of this ’activity may
be judged from the results achieved by
Burns Consolidated in 1960-61, which
of course was a bad year for companies
in general, and for textile companies
(among other certain industries) in par-
ticular. On ordinary capital increased by
a one-for-five issue at par in November
1960 (when ordinary shares previously
held by Burns Dye Works Pty Ltd were
offered to shareholders), the company
earned 27.8 p.c.
company said that the difficult year
A in the textile trade resulted in the
reduced level of activity of the dyeworks.
However, the subsidiary with the sole
distribution right of the “Cashmilon”
yarn greatly increased its activity during
the year, so that the overall result was
very comparable with that of the pre-
vious record financial year, especially as
in the year ended June 30, 1961, the
taxation provision was for the first time
since the reorganisation at the beginning
of 1958 an approximately “normal”
amount.
For the purpose of providing extra
working capital to finance the increased
volume of business being undertaken by
the company, a one-for-two par issue
was made in March, 1962. However, the
company achieved a record profit, so that
on 50 p.c. higher capital the earning rate
on year-end capital rose to 36.3 p.c.,
thereby enabling the dividend to be raised
from the 10 p.c. paid in 1960-61 to 12+
p.c. in 1961-62, in addition to which the
final dividend of 7i p.c. was also paid
on the new shares issued in March.
In September, 1962, sole distribution
rights were also obtained for “Cash-
milon” tow, the raw material which is
now being spun into yarn in Australia.
Thus as success seems to be breeding
success, Burns Distributors could well
gain further distribution rights for ad-
ditional suitable materials for importing
into this country, and this could continue
to augment the profits obtained from the
also successful commission dyeing busi-
ness.
Thus, the history of Burns Consolidat-
ed over the five years since its formation
has been one of greatly expanding
profitability and financial strength.
Operating income has increased by over
200 p.c. and earnings per share by 132
p.c. despite an increase of 81 p.c. in
ordinary capital, all of which had been
issued to shareholders.
In March this year the company again
made a one-for-two cash issue at par,
thereby raising ordinary capital to its
present level of £102,000. In addition,
the directors indicated a 15 p.c. dividend
rate by raising the interim payment to
p.c. last April. As in the previous
financial year, the directors are confident
that the final dividend will also be paid
on the larger capital.
In its interim report in March, the
company announced substantial turnover
and profit increases over the correspond-
ing period of the previous year, and
directors expected the 1962-63 profit to
show a considerable improvement over
the record in 1961-62. Indeed, the
recently announced record profit by Pres-
tige Ltd tends to confirm the improved
trading conditions at present.
JgECAUSE of rapid profit growth and the
high dividend cover (even on the
basis of present paid up ordinary capital
and last year’s consolidated profit), it
would seem likely that it will be not so
long before the dividend rate is again
raised.
Thus, at around 15s. to yield 5
p.c. from the current 15 p.c. dividend
rate, Burns Consolidated represents good
buying, both on the basis of immediate
dividend yield and the bright prospects
of a further dividend increase in the
near future. Foe example, if in 1963-64
the dividend rate were increased to 17i
p.c., then the shares at around 17s. 6d.
would still yield a high 5.0 p.c., thereby
giving some indication of the scope for
possible future capital appreciation.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Will Swallows Be Swallowed?
HThe revolution in retailing of food has
produced some alliances amongst
manufacturers, and some unexpected
falls by the wayside in the last few years.
Swallow and Ariell Ltd of Victoria,
which dates back to 1888 registration,
has now had two years of unprofitable
trading, although directors refer to the
latest loss of £34,901 as “a significant
improvement” on the deficit of £87,251
for 1961-62.
The only explanation for the previous
big lo,ss was “a marked decline in sales
during the year in which very difficult
trading conditions were experienced.”
Directors currently report that in-
creased sales in 1962-63 accompanied a
reduction in costs, to reduce the rate of
loss.
Ordinary shareholders have missed out
on dividends for the last two years, al-
though holders of the cumulative par-
ticipating preference shares, who re-
ceived 12! p.c. in 1959 and 1960, and
8 p.c. in 1961 along with ordinary share-
holders, have been paid the basic 6 p.c.
dividend in 1962 and 1963.
Sale of fixed assets brought a capital
profit of £12,599, but this was almost en-
tirely negated by writing off £10,603 for
works development costs.
Swallow and Ariell makes biscuits and
plum puddings. Its name was also asso-
ciated with ice cream, but following
heavy losses in this department in 1956,
the company sold it to Peters Ice Cream
(Vic.) Ltd.
The chances of Swallow and Ariell
making a successful come-back on its
own look pretty slim, although directors
aim to return to a profitable basis
this year. Apart from the ice-cream
failure, the company has made a
couple of expensive tactical errors. It
ignored a gentleman’s agreement between
biscuit makers a few years ago to invade
the NSW market, thus inviting William
Arnott to retaliate by invading its own
home territory. It also stood by while
Arnott’s took over South Australian
company, W. Menz, and Victorian T. B.
Guest.
A new factory was built in 1961 in
Hobart for the Tasmanian subsidiary,
Swallow Haywood Pty Ltd. Its produc-
tion had to exceed Tasmanian consump-
tion to be economical which meant
transporting goods back to the main-
land. Since 1963 balance date, this plant
was sold for £120,000. Improved trans-
port between Tasmania and Victoria will
now permit concentration of manufac-
ture at Port Melbourne.
The major line-up in the biscuit market
today is the Australian Biscuit Co. Pty
which emerges as a result of the marriage
of Brockhoffs and William Arnott, and
controls about 70 p.c. of the market, the
two UK groups, Peek Frean and George
Weston (about 10 p.c. each), Swallow
and Ariell (about 8 to 9 p.c.), and the
rest.
Swallow and Ariell’s strong reserves
position vis-a-vis the present market price
of the shares (265. for both ordinary and
preference shares) makes it an attractive
takeover proposition.
The US Nabisco group has been ex-
amining the Australian biscuit market,
but so far has no biscuit-making plant
here, although it bought out the Purina
cereal group in 1960, and the NZ bis-
cuit maker Griffin and Sons Ltd last year
There are thoughts, however, that
Nabisco joined the Arnott-Brockhoff-
Guests-Menz field by purchase of a sub-
stantial holding in Australian Biscuit Co
(This has not so far been confirmed.)
Even so there are potential bidders
for Swallow and Ariell in George
Weston which is known to have Aus-
tralian biscuit ambitions, other overseas
giants not already here, and last, but
by no means least, the local flourmillers
(Its main suppliers of flour are John
Darling and Son (Australia) Ltd, Robert
Hutchinson Ltd and F. B. Quickhard.)
Swallow and Ariell shares, listed on
Melbourne and Brisbane Exchanges, are
supported in the market by the high assets
backing and these takeover possibilities.
The ordinary shares are of 30s. par value,
but there is 10s. uncalled liability on
these. The 20s. preference shares rank
equally with ordinaries in surplus assets
in the event of a wind-up.
Holders of 7 p.c. 20s. unsecured notes,
issued to ordinary and preference share-
holders in 1959, have the right to con-
vert to fully paid 20s. ordinary shares
on April 30, 1964. (They participate
meanwhile in cash issues, but not bonuses,
and there is no provision in the Trust
Deed for a takeover.) As there are at
present no 20s. ordinary shares issued,
this will add a new class of ordinary
share to the lists, unless the 10s. liability
on the 30s. shares is cancelled.
Swallow and Ariell has had too good
a record in the past, and the food market
has seen too many fruitful alliances in
recent years, for holders of any stake in
the company to give up their interest
lightly.

BROOKLANDS (Holdings) LTD
Insulated Against Shocks
T>rooklands (Holdings) Ltd, Mel-
bourne distributor of automotive
components, lifted dividend for the year
to April 30, 1963, from its customary
rate of 12! p.c. to 14 p.c.
Record sales and profit were a fitting
climax to 40 years of successful trading
by the original subsidiary, Brooklands
Accessories Pty, and 30 years’ represen-
tation of Joseph Lucas Industries Ltd by
the other principal Victorian subsidiary,
Starting Lighting Ignition Pty.
The NSW subsidiary, Brooklands Ac-
cessories (NSW) Pty, made steady pro-
gress, despite intense competition. It has
a substantial share interest in Wipac
(Australia) Pty, which also had a suc-
cessful year, although Brooklands di-
rectors indicated that overseas competi-
tion could affect future profit.
Net result was an increase in profit
from £102,035 to £132,098 after tax
of £74,000 (1962 £66,000) and deprecia-
tion of £29,019 (£.26,083). Earning rate
of 26.5 p.c. gave plenty of cover for
the increased 14 p.c. dividend.
The company has a sound profit
record back to at least 1938. The year

1960-61 was a troubled one for the
whole automotive industry, and Brook-
lands was no exception, but the 12i p.c.
dividend was not endangered.
Last capital benefit to shareholders
was participation in a two-for-five con-
vertible note issue in 1960. Prior to that,
formation of the holding company in
1955 gave (in effect) a one-for-two
bonus to shareholders. A one-for-two par
issue and premium issue and a one-for-
four bonus in 1951 complete the record
of issues since 1950.
The Brooklands group distributes for
many of the world’s most important
companies in the automotive supplies
field: GMH, Ford, International Har-
vester, Champion Spark Plugs, Balm
Paints, British Automotive Products,
Marvel-Schebler, Lincoln Electric, Wil-
lard Storage Battery, Wico-Pacy, Lewis
Berger, SKF Ball Bearing, Union Car-
bide, Tillotson, Joseph Lucas, CAV,
Girling, S. Smith, Siemens Henley and
EMI.
Management declares that success in
Brooklands’ type of business depends
primarily on stock availability. Stock is
tightly controlled and valued consis-
tently.
The <£54,046 increase in group
stocks to £835,088 was called for by
the heavier demand. Debtors also were
higher.
Sales for the opening two months of
the current year are ahead of last year,
so the portents are good.
The consistent profit record and fre-
quent capital benefits present an attrac-
tive picture to investors. Although an
automotive stock is necessarily subject
to economic shocks, these seem to be
fairly well insulated in Brookland’s case.
The immediate future is promising,
so the present price of about 14s. Id. is
not excessive. The yield of 5.0 p.c. from
die higher dividend rate is superior to
that of manufacturers of automotive
parts.

KINNEARS ROPES (Aust.) LTD
Solid But Unexciting
11/hile no growth in earnings has been
'' evident in the last nine years, Kin-
nears Ropes (Aust.) Ltd showed it had
not stagnated entirely, by taking over the
business of Frank and Bryce Bentley Pty
Ltd and its subsidiary during 1962-63.
Kinnears Ropes was formed in 1954
to take over the business of Geo. Kin-
near and Sons Pty, which had manu-
factured rope, cord, binder twine, ship
and sewing twine, sash cords, jute hemp
and flax yarns, and shoe threads since
1910.
Trends towards bulk handling of
primary products and other changing
customs have robbed Kinnears of some
of its traditional markets, so it is neces-
sary for the company to move into allied
fields to advance.
The manufacture of industrial mops
and buffs was therefore undertaken as
from 1956 by a wholly owned subsidiary
B. D. Mops and Buff. In the latest year
to February 28, this subsidiary experienc-
ed keen competition.
The new subsidiary, Frank and Bryce
Bentley, makes rope cord and thread in
NSW. Its subsidiary, Marine Accessories,
catering to the fishing industry, was care-
fully scrutinised by Kinnear management
as its business is keenly competitive.
Net result of operations for 1962-63
was a better profit of £158,283 (last year
£128,314), after greater provisions for
depreciation at £74,913 (£52,429) and
for tax at £107,135 (£67,000). The earn-
ing rate on enlarged capital edged up
from 11.8 to 12.0 p.c., as against a
steady dividend rate of 9 p.c.
The new subsidiaries contributed to
profit for only eight months of the year,
and as their incorporation occasioned
non-repeating expense, group earnings
should rise in the current term.
The demand for industrial yarns
for flax canvas, jute carpet and carpet
pile improved appreciably, but direc-
tors are disturbed at the danger of jute
yarn imports, especially from India. A
second approach to the Tariff Board for
protection could be necessary.
The rope-making departments worked
overtime during 1962-63.
A new member of the board of direc-
tors is Mr W. E. Luke, chairman of
Lindustries Ltd, one of the largest thread
manufacturers in England. This is view-
ed as an important bond furthering the
close co-operation which already exists
between the two companies, especially in
the field of synthetic threads.
Reserves were augmented during the
year to the extent of £116,250 for share
premiums relative to the takeovers, and
an item of £124,843 in the 1962 balance
sheet for goodwill was wiped out and
replaced by a £30,610 surplus on con-
solidation.
Kinnears took over a long-term liability
to the then shareholders of Erank and
Bryce Bentley, for £390,830, which will
be repaid on favourable terms. Liquidity
is very sound, in directors’ opinion. Book
debts are stringently controlled, inventor-
ies rationalised, and redundant assets
(particularly NSW properties) are being
liquidated.

Admittedly the company’s steady divi-
dend record was gilded by a one-for-five
bonus in July, 1959, but in the last two
years the earning rate has been at a
much lower level. Net tangible assets
backing was this year bolstered from
14s. lid. to 16s. 5d., but unless group
earnings this year show a substantial re-
covery, the prospects of another bonus
are limited. The market has taken the
shares quite high enough, on evidence
available to date.

SA BREWING CO. LTD
Bonus for 75th Birthday
Ohareholders in South Australian
Brewing Co. Ltd are still very much
in the dark as to the real worth of their
investment.
The new Companies Act was not pro-
claimed in South Australia until July 1,
so this company need not, until next
year, conform to standards of reporting
generally accepted elsewhere as sound
accounting practice and good public
relations.
Provisions for depreciation and taxa-
tion have never been disclosed, so that
shareholders have no evidence in which
to examine directors’ profit revelations.
The taxation provision in the balance
sheet is thrown in with trade creditors
and accrued liabilities, preventing
observers from drawing any conclusions
from this liability.
Profit for the year to February 28,
1963, rose 15.6 p.c. from £441,211 to
a record £534,569. Dividend once more
reverted to a 10 p.c. payment, suggesting
that another bonus could be in sight.
At least a building up to this dividend
rate has been the pattern before two
earlier handouts (in the ratio of three
for five) in 1959 and 1955. South Aus-
tralian Brewing is now in its 75th year of
operations, so that a bonus would be an
appropriate form of celebration.
September could again be the month
for its announcement, when results for
the half-year are in directors’ hands.
Three par issues had been made in
earlier post-war years.
The company, which dates back to
1888, has a total paid capital of
£4,827,295 including £83,132 in em-
ployees’ shares. Reserves total
£2,496,138, of which £1,115,967 rep-
resents assets revaluation.
The company‘s accounts are marked
by a negative working capital position
(common to brewers) which does not
seem to impede its progress.
The most important changes in the
1963 accounts were a £285,411 increase
in freeholds to £6,571,131, a £159,200
increase in debtors to £607,046, and the
£101,924 increase in investments. This
latter change no doubt reflects the ex-
change of shares with the other SA
brewer, Cooper and Sons Ltd, whereby
South Australian Brewing now holds 25
p.c. of Cooper’s capital. This was
interpreted as a defensive move when
the UK Charrington group was on the
prowl for an opening here.
The chairman ascribed the company’s
success in 1962-63 to the investment in
new hotels and remodelling of old ones,
constant attention to production pro-
cedures, and South Australia’s growing
population.
The Warradale hotel is now under
construction, the Rose and Crown will
be begun at Elizabeth later this year,
and another hotel is planned for con-
struction in Morphett next year.

EXPORTS TO S. AMERICA
Australian exports to South America
in the first half of 1962-63 were
valued at <£l.9m., equal to the total for
the previous 12 months. The increase
was due mainly to the Government’s
trade drive in the area.
The main commodities being exported
are wheat, tallow, steel, agricultural
machinery, wool tops, butter and zinc..
Shipments of files, drills, automotive
spare parts, tractor parts and general
hardware items have also been made.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Two Towns in a Tug-of-War
Turbulence Over Wheat Research
several years Victorian wheat-
growers have been engaged in a
tug-of-war with their State Government
over where to put a new research centre.
Now they have given an extra hard
jerk, and it remains to be seen whether
they will pull the Government with them
or fall on their faces.
In the matter of choosing a site, the
Government, through the agency of the
Department of Agriculture, has dug its
heels in at Horsham. The growers,
through the Victorian Wheat Research
Foundation, have propped at the smal-
ler town of Dimboola, 22 miles to the
west.
Now the Victorian Wheat and Wool
Growers’ Association has defied Gov-
ernment and department by instructing
the Victorian Wheat Research Founda-
tion, which it was charged with forming,
to go ahead with the purchase of two
Dimboola sites it has tagged for the
proposed Wheat Research Institute of
Victoria.
Proposals to expand wheat research
in this State have been accompanied by
a turbulence that seems out of keeping
with work so innocent and worthy.
Part of the price is that Victoria is now
lagging behind other States, such as
New South Wales, that for years envied
its scientific advances in wheat, which
brings the State some £.37 million a
year.
wrangle that has culminated in
the wheat-growers’ defiance goes
back seven years to when the Australian
Wheatgrowers’ Federation's plan to levy
growers id. a bushel for research first
saw light.
Objections from Victorian growers
centred on how the Wheat Research
Committee that would preside over the
work was to be composed. The organisa-
tion affiliated with the federation The
Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers’
Association insisted that only such an
affiliated body should represent growers
on the committee, pointing out that this
principle had been adopted in other
States. In the face of the objections the
Government appointed to the committee
a man from the rival and unaffiliated
Australian Primary Producers’ Union.
Subsequently, the Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture announced its pro-
posals for the establishment of a Wim-
mera Wheat Research Centre, for which
£153,000 of growers’ money has been
ear-marked to buy an experiment farm
and a small town allotment.
The institute’s work would include
agricultural chemistry, plant nutrition
and physiology, milling and baking
quality of wheat, plant pathology, ento-
mology and plant genetics and the agro-
nomic studies normal on a research sta-
tion, such as Longerenong Agricultural
College, seven miles from Horsham,
now carries out.
ThtE idea was for the industry to buy
the property and the department to
staff it. The department said it wanted
the institute to be somewhere in the
area of the Wimmera triangle with
apexes at Horsham, Dimboola and War-
racknabeal.
Then followed discussions on owner-
ship, the Government insisting that it
should be handed over as a gift and
the growers demanding that it should
be held in trust for them. The committee
instructed the Victorian Wheat and
Wool Growers’ Association to set up a
Wheat Research Foundation to keep the
properties in trust for growers.
It was agreed between the foundation
and the department that some 30 proper-
ties in the specified area should be
inspected and one selected by mutual
agreement.
The Foundation chose the Dimboola
sites and the department of Horsham
ones, and since then argument has raged.
The growers say Horsham district is
already well served in wheat research by
nearby Longerenong College. They
maintain that Dimboola has the better
soil type for an institute and that it
is more typical of Wimmera wheat-
growing than Horsham.
Ostensibly at least, the department’s
preference for Horsham rests on the
argument that it is the only Wimmera
town large enough for the institute to
obtain and keep staff.
Impatient at the delay, which had
threatened to become a deadlock, the
State executive of the Victorian Wheat
and Wool Growers’ Association, after
a nine-hour debate, recently instructed
the trustees of the Foundation to pro-
ceed with the purchase of the Dimboola
properties. Further, it decided that if
the department failed to conduct re-
search as agreed, the trustees should
adopt “alternative means” of running
the institute.
The issue was introduced by the chair-
man of the Foundation, Mr E. E.
Nuske (of Dimboola), who had under-
taken to present to the association a
proposal by the Minister for Agriculture,
Mr Chandler, that a third party, con-
sisting of representatives of either
CSIRO or the Melbourne University or
both, investigate the recommendations
for location of the institute.
proposal was not welcomed
warmly, for the Foundation mem-
bers did not want to place themselves in
the position of having to abide by an
arbitrator that would possibly rule against
them when the department could still
insist on Horsham if the decision went
the other way.
The chief president of the association,
Mr P. J. Meehan, is certain the Govern-
ment will not agree to sites other than
Horsham, and has urged growers to lay
the baby in the department’s lap by
buying the Dimboola properties and
handing them to the department as a
gift.
If the Government accepts the grow-
ers’ challenge by refusing to staff the in-
stitute, much pressure can be expected
to be put on it by all political parties
to force a change of mind.
Some think the Government’s stand
for Horsham is not entirely altruistic.
It is not hard for a schoolboy to see
that by transferring the experimental
side of the work at Longerenong Col-
lege to the institute and reducing the
college’s role to that of teaching only,
the Government would shed a burden
without depriving the area of the re-
search to which it has become
accustomed.
Some growers, mindful that the Foun-
dation’s latest tug might leave it with all
the rope, console themselves with the
thought that if the estrangement be-
tween growers and department con-
tinues, the institute will be built quickly
by private contractors instead of suffer-
ing a protracted birth at the hands of
the Public Works Department.
But this is small balm for the in-
dustry’s exasperation at the delay, which
is serving, among other things, to excite
the ambitions of other Wimmera areas.
The longer it continues, the more
chance there is of wholesome little Wim-
mera wheat-growing centres turning into
political jackals.


SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The Market Seen From “Kossy”
TTello there! Guess where I’ve been?
I’ve been to Thredbo with Nola
and Marcel. What a fairytale place this
is.
The Stock Exchange was well rep-
resented and I had an interesting chat
with a visiting member of the Madrid
Stock Exchange, Senor Valdej.
But what’s this got to do with the
share market and my portfolio? Noth-
ing, except, perhaps, that one of the
companies operating in the area —Lend
Lease, Publishers, United Motels, or
even Anse.tt —might have something up
its sleeve not known in Sydney.
In the meantime Paynter and Dixon
caught my glassy eye. I’d been toying
with the idea of buying them for some
time and it was the result (announced
recently) that finally did the trick. An
already healthy earning rate of 32.8
p.c. last year moved up to 35.3 p.c. On
top of this is the record amount of
work on hand.
Although the company offers a com-
plete building package deal, even from
the site selection and purchase, most of
the work is sub-contracted. As a result,
there is a minimum of direct overhead.
This has been the secret of its steady
growth throughout the rises and falls
in demand in the building industry.
Buying simply on a good result is
often buying at the top. But further
good news may follow when directors
consider the dividend rate next month.
Buying 400 Paynter and Dixon and
meeting the application money on the
Walton’s rights puts me well into debt
again.
While the rest of the market has
been revelling and the delights of
Thredbo keeping pace with its liveliness,
I hardly think that my Australian Motel
Industries look like matching these
excitements. So I decided to drop the
lot at ss. 3d. In this heady atmosphere
the loss of £.2 Is. Bd. drifts away with
the snowflakes.
All the same, in the cold light of
dawn, it was very nice to contemplate
the behavior of W. J. Manufacturing.
The 10s. shares, bought at 17s. 6d.,
jumped very quickly to 19s. 6d. with-
out any benefit of chair-lift. The ensuing
profit on the sale was £.7.
Transactions for the week were:
