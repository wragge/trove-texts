SECURES SOUND WHITE TEETH AND A HEALTHY MOUTH.
Some practical reasons why Hudson’s Eumenthol Tooth Powder
should be used for Cleansing and Preserving the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues
that have made Eumenthol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but
cleanses mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the teeth so wonder-
fully, and wards off decay as no other preparation for the teeth
can do, or will do, without affecting the Tooth Enamel.
BECAUSE the Committee of the British Dental Association
recommends Powder in preference to Pastes, Liquids or Soaps for
cleasing and preserving the teeth.

HYMN TO THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW
POETRY.
... .If thou must turn round to number the
bacMcards links of the chain
which fastens' thy thought to the bones of the
dead and the more than dead
thou wilt only Jose the strong thread which
holds thee to life.
Cast thy song, then, 0 man, through dilated
lips
on the wind of to-morrow!
I too have loved women and ancient grave-
yards :
Then poetry was
to sip the aiuemic and delicate gall of the
spirit
along the large open pages of mouldering
tombstones
in some necropolis, safe amid perfumes of
violets and of memories
and the tender hair of dead women
such things as brought tears to the eyes and
felicitous rimes to the mind.
But now I feel a new sunlight shining upon
my heart,
and a marvellous song in the deep.
Therefore it is lovely to sing
as the madman sings
who, close in his tiny cell,
uplifts from morning till evening
the sobbing .spring of his soul
and casts it
in a rapturous jet to his brothers the,
stars ....
And this poetry is daughter of the wind of
the Alps,
It is white with their snow, it is blue from
their sky, it is red icith the blood of the
sun.
It is true; not reckoned by feet, but made
without measure,
like the freedom of Life unincarnate
or like the adorable Void.
Hast thou ever computed
the number of feet to the scansion
of a jagged segment of lightning?
How many caesuras
break the beat of a gust of the wind?....
We race.
We rise.
We must sing a new song of our speed.
We must chant a new hymn of ascent....
O mankind of yesterday
you may bury a spear in your bosom!
Born is the race that shall leave you behind
by a leap into Heaven, the men
who tread you like ants, and crush.
Follow us to the peaks of the mountains,
climb to our airships!
Throw up your souls like rubber balls,
No, higher! Oh, higher! And send
the shout of your rage and your love!
Salute us in volleys of praise and of death!
For life is becoming
a, Vertigo.
Will you have yourselves, sluggards! still
seated
on your chairs, carried into the Heights?
—Paolo Buzzi.
AGAINST THE EARTH.
Oh the Earth, and its symmetry, and the
curves of its geometry
and its walk of a lazy donkey
which, blindfold, drives in a circle
the flaring wheel of the sun; and it draws
for evermore,
adulterated light out of the depth of
space....
Oh the Earth!. Oh the Earth!... .Alas,
the nausea of living
crouched on its shoulders: we are like per-
forming monkeys
frilled and adorned and ' brought to the
fair.
Destroy ! destroy! destroy !....
For no beauty exists but alone in the sound
of this savage command
which is keen like the blade of a guillotine,
destroy! destroy! destroy!....
—F. T. Marinetti.
THE CLOCK.
....O man, all ye men,
you carry a watch in your pockets and cannot
tell
all the things about you it must know,
it will not fail to record,
and will not ever repeat.
I looked at the clock and I thought:
Marker of time, thou knowst
all about me, tell me the hour at which I
shall die.
Is it two? Is it five? Is it three?
One minute past three? Two minutes past
three?
God! now I felt myself die,
die every minute.
In the face of that vile clock
I heaped and I hurled all my rage,
every object that chanced to my hand
I threw.
Insults and spittle and lew dities,
boots and shoes and inkpots.
And it stopped, and it stopped,
and it stopped at six.
At the moment it seemed
that now I was free of it. ...
But the following day
from the stroke of that hour
I looked at the clock,
and out of its stern immobility
understood it teas six
was the fatal hour
beyond any escape.
Every day I was doomed
and must die at that hour:
that hour of impending sunset,
or of the Ave Maria....
Now in my desperation
I rushed upon the timepieec,
Disembowelling it....
0 men, you icho know not the way to ho
born,
nor are even aware by yourselves hoio to
die,
you cherish so dear on your breast, on your
heart,
that machine which knows that hour of
yours,
and will not tell you, and every day
beats it out on your bosom: you notice it
not.
I bless that wise man who knows Ms hour
to die
and I kneel at the feet of the man who can
kill himself.
Wherefore do 1 wait?. ...
Oh from the highest of towers
to give one’s Self up to delight of the void,
to fall into space,
leaving only one stain
of crimson behind on the earth!
And thou clock, thou foreknowing,
that hour is inscribed on thy visage,
thou, maintaining thy sloiv x>ace,
shalt quietly mark it,
quietly pass on.
While 1 shall not know, nor guess:
it was that, that which made me shiver,
every day that hour which went by unob-
served,
that hour, that unknowable hour.
.No! I will build myself up a tower on a
hill
and tvill mount it at my oivn hour
the one I have chosen....
And I shout to thee: Clock, now mark, for I
spring —-
Then I spring.
Ha! I heard something snap!
It was thou, great fool, thou hast signalled
the hour
believing it that one already.
Ahahahahahah !
No, it was not that one.
but another I know of, I!
Henceforward it is I who command,
and I will dictate the moment to thee, thou
base clock.
It is mine to find in my throat,
and utter out of my belly
the most mad, most obscene bursts of
laughter,
the unscemliest jokes
and bitterest howls of mockery,
so to keep thee waiting
another five minutes.
Ai.no Palazzeschi.
(Freely rendered into English by Harold
Monro, in Poetry and Drama.)
These abbreviated examples of the Futurist
poetry of the Italian Futurists appear in
Poetky and Drama (Devonshir e-street, Lon-
don), the half-crown quarterly published by
the Poetry Bookshop. The editor devotes
much of his space in one issue of this recog-
nised organ of modern poetry to this new
portent in verse: he even proclaims himself
a futurist —with two planks in his platform:
(1) To forget God, Heaven, Hell. Personal
Immortality, and to remember, always, the
earth. (2) To lift the eyes from a sentimen-
tal contemplation of the past, and, though
dwelling in the present, nevertheless, always,
to live in the future of the earth. The
Italian book of The Futurist Poets, an
anthology selected from the work of 10
Futurists, from which the above examples, or
screeches, are taken, is now in its 35th thou-
sand. No Futurist, we learn, makes any
claim for recognition on posterity; every poet
with all his works must be swept away, in
turn, to the wastepaper basket. “All author-
ity, every right, and all power must be bru-
tally torn from the dead and the dying, and
given to the young of from 20 to 40 years.”
Theirs is verse for the ear, meant for imme-
diate and wide circulation and declamation
in large assemblies. No modern movement
can do without advertisement; and the very
extravagances of the Futurists are deliberate
—part of a clever advertising campaign.
Without these glaring excrescences the move-
ment would not have been so widely ridi-
culed —nor so widely advertised. This poetry
is almost frankly propaganda. It is poetry
for the populace—verse that is meant to be
read with the excitement that one reads the
latest war news, or declaimed at public
meetings." “Futurism chiefly asks of man
that, instead of walking backwards with eyes
of regret fixed on the past, he turn round and
walk face forward, in love of the future.” And
its vigor, its frenzy, its self-consciousness, its
tiptoe exaltation, are in themselves valuable
and virile elements to inject into an art that
has become stereotyped in the hands of
“rolled-gold” poets. The Muse, instead of
dawdling along the dreary pathways of the
past, must go into training and set out after
records. And that lazy nag, Pegasus, will be
entered for the Melbourne Cup. What is he
given wings for if not to fly?
However, the Futurist movement has
progressed since the publication of
these examples of its message. The
latest book by Marinetti bears the name
or title of Zang Tumb Tumb, but unfortu-
nately it has not yet been translated from
the Italian. His aim now is to forge a style at
one time “polychromatic, polymorphous and
polyphonic, that may not only animalise,
vegetise, electrify and liquefy itself, but pene-
trate and express the essence and the atomic
life of matter.” The use of the wildest
onomatopoeic words, mathematical signs and
numbers, and a free and expressive use of
types, are alleged to fulfil some of the neces-
sary requirements and to give to the poems
written in. this medium their “geometrical
and mechanical splendor.” London Times
gives an example of the later Marinetti’s
pictorial style.

Ia an interesting article in a recent Fort-
nightly Henry Newbolt happily attempts to
put the raw material of Keats’s “Ode to a
Nightingale” into Futurist form. Marinetti
would, of course, not have used for his title
so traditional a word as Ode. Possibly he
would have titled his poem “Bi-Planing.”
Anyhow, here it is :

We have contributed nothing to the Futurist
movement in poetry. This page will give a
guinea to the best Futurist poem—not
to exceed 30 lines—received by October 10.
Competitors can choose their models—basing
their poems either upon the models first
quoted in this article, or upon the geometri-
cal design of Marinetti’s latest Italian poem,
or upon no models at all —for Futurism is
bound by no conventions.
Sexual Ethics
The primary aim of Robert Michels, in
Sexual Ethics (Scott, per Dymock’s
Library), is to wage war upon all fig-leaves.
This new volume in the “Contemporary
Science Series” is written by a Basle Pro-
fessor ; and its secondary title, A Study of
Borderland Questions, enables the author to
include within his ambit almost every aspect
of modern sex problems. In speaking of
the need of sexuaj enlightenment of the
young, the author insists that it is impossible
to lay down general rules. “The writer of
this book would by no means pledge himself
to place it in the hands of his own daughter,
to whom the work is dedicated, as soon as
she is grown up. For it is impossible to
deny that such a book as the present one
may arouse the desire in one whose mental
state is unwholesome, to skim its pages,
caring nothing for the writer’s lofty moral
aim, and to make use of it as corrupt boys
often use the Bible (which indeed lends
itself to this purpose), in search of stimu-
lating mysteries. The question whether a
serious, honest and sincere book, such as
this, should be given to or withheld from a
grown girl must be decided in each case on
its merits.”
The author’s conclusion on prostitution is
that “the great majority of prostitutes enter
their profession as a direct consequence of
economic pressure. It is a fact of observa-
tion that where women’s wages rise prostitu-
tion diminishes to a proportionate'degree.”
The whole question is exhaustively examined.
He deduces the ingenious conclusion that
the prostitute is the “old maid” of the pro-
letariat. The phenomenon of the “old maid”
is practically confined to the bourgeoisie.
Among the proletariat it is almost unknown.
In the working classes the mature woman
who remains a maid, in the strictly physio-
logical sense of the term, is an altogether
abnormal phenomenon. “With rare excep-
tions” —he is speaking of the European pro-
letariat —“among wage-earning women, such
as factory and agricultural workers, over
30 years of age, we find none unmarried
and bachelor workmen are few and far
between.” It is from the unmarried adult
women of the proletariat that prostitutes
are recruited. There are few old maids
among the working classes ; first, because the
male worker needs a wife to look after his
home —a need not so strongly felt by the
well-to-do male; and, secondly, because the
unmarried women who would otherwise
become old maids have another profession
open to them —that of prostitution. In
addition, in Europe, there is a large over-
production of women, the logical outcome of
which is the existence of prostitution.
“Thus the social order of to-day, as far as
sexual relationships are concerned, gives rise
to two social phenomena in total conflict
with women’s nature, conditions analagous to
those of the most depraved epoch of Asiatic
antiquity- To the unmarried middle-class
girl love is forbidden, even when she desires;
upon the unmarried proletariat girl, on the
other hand, erotic intercourse is imposed, even
when she has no desire for it. In other
words, the present social order denies to the
bourgeois girl the right to sexual love, and
simultaneously denies to the proletarian girl
the right to renounce sexual love—a proof
that the system whose outcome is such a
social order is grossly oppressive, not only
to both sexes of the proletariat, but also to
an extensive proportion of women of the
middle classes From the ethical point of
view, prostitution is equivalent to a slap in
the face for the whole world of womanhood.”
“Nevertheless, the vociferous cry, ‘Down
with Prostitution!’ raised by so many moral-
ists of the last and the present generation, is
at once stupid and laughable. For all the
anger of the world is merely an idle waste
of energy, unless the institution against
which that anger is directed has been thor-
oughly analysed and understood, and until
the causes of which that institution is the
inevitable outcome have been discovered and
uprooted The St. George that will slay
the dragon of prostitution, as v/e know the
monster to-day, must be the complete
economic and cultural equality of all .mem-
bers of the community, without distinction of
sex.” Which sounds suspiciously like that
awful thing called Socialism.
With regard to the question of the value
and the limits of chastity, as applied to men,
the author holds no brief for the chaste
unmarried male. “It must . honestly be
recognised that sexually abstinent young
men, as they present themselves to-day, can-
not offer to girls any guarantee of happy
marriage—if we except those few sincere *
Christians or genuine idealists who have
led an austere or intensely intellectual life
under the shadow of the paternal. roqf, and
have thus been preserved from all impure
contact; and if we except also young men
who are too shy and awkward to assume
the initiative. Generally speaking, the men
who remain chaste are men of little worth.
The man who has remained pure simply
because he is engrossed in business affairs
and devoted to the pursuit of gain, will
continue after marriage to prefer money to
his wife, and if he succeeds in gaining the
wealth he desires he will leave his wife
to that life of idleness which will throw
her into the arms of the first alluring
woman-hunter that comes along, while he
himself is growing prematurely grey in the
dull routine of his office. The young man,
on the other hand, who is chaste because
careful of his health, is likely to be no less
eccentric, egoistic and cowardly as a hus-
band The desire that one’s daughter
may marry a man as pure as herself is one
that may lead to profound disillusionments.
Even if to-day the demand for chaste young
men is extremely restricted, the supply is
yet more so, and the article is of such an
inferior quality that in actual practice the
attempt to satisfy this desire is likely, to
lead to disappointing results. Notwith-
standing all this, it is impossible to deny
that masculine virginity prior to marriage
is in itself a good thing.”
The volume shows abounding evidences of
careful and curious observation in little-
known by-paths of the psychology and socio-
logy of sex. It is written frankly and
cleanly, and is elaborately documented with
quotation and foot-note. It is not a work
for the immature, nor for the merely curi-
ous. Neither of these classes will find in
the volume what presumably it would look
to find.
Peeps into the Past; Pioneering Days on
the Manning, by F. A. Fitzpatrick (Cum-
berland Argus, Parramatta, 25.), claims
no acquaintance with literature ; but amidst
much verbiage are to be found interesting
records of the early days on the Manning.
Most of the inhabitants of that region are
centenarians, or have merely lost count of
birthdays: many of them have 250 living
descendants. Portraits of the Methuselahs
adorn the pages, and poetry adds another
grace. This sort of poetry;—
Ninety-four, and still proceeding — give a
cheer, and touch the gong,
In the Race of Life he's leading — Abbott,
John, of Kolodong.

Self-Loading Shotgun
12 GAUGE, TAKE-DOWN
Since its introduction, sportsmen
have subjected this gun to almost
every conceivable test. In no
fair trial has it failed to stand up
or prove its supremacy. Its
Nickel Steel construction gives
strength to shoot maximum loads
with safety, and its reloading
system the ability to handle the
lightest or heaviest loads without
tinkering the action. In this gun
the “kick” is minimized to the
last degree. It has other dis-
tinctive features to recommend
it, as an inspection will show.

Your Tongue never fails

a lifetime—enables you to
master any horse —to tell the
disposition of any horse at
sight—to add many dollars to
the value of every horse you
handle—and my students are
all good traders.

A WOMAN’S BIRTHRIGHT!
A CORRECTLY RII ST I
DEVELOPED ■ ■
Every woman can have a perfect figure. A deficiency in bust is
readily corrected by Dr. Fallieue's Flesh-Food treatment. The best
evidence is that of those who have used it. It is never-failing. See
what MRS. K. WINGROVE, of Gympie, Queensland, a skilled nurse,
says of its efficacy:—
“After leaving- off your treatment I waited several months
to see if the results were permanent before writing you, and
1 now wish to say that I think the treatment is absolutely
marvellous. Before adopting it I was only skin and bones,
hut now I am one of the best walking advertisements you
could have. It did all you claimed for it and really more,
and the results were startlingly ahead of my fondest expec-
tations. My health and appearance have improved most
satisfactorily, and I now thank you for urging me to have
the treatment.”
We haven’t room to give you more letters here like this one, but we will send you scores of
them upon request. We possess thousands of grateful testimonials.
Many cases gain as much as 51b. a week, and improvements up to as much as ten inches
have been made in the bust measurements. Guarantee given in every case.
Put up in tablet form, it is pleasant to take, and palatable. It leaves no unpleasant after-
effects, and the results are permanent and lasting. It can be taken secretly.

We want you to know just what FLESH-FOOD is, and will gladly give you a free sample.

The Expert.
Yes, I am the military critic;
With calm, callous pen analytic,
I explain and dissect
And expose and detect.
Observe me ! —the military critic !
This week I am moving vast numbers
Of men. I was last on cucumbers
The next crops and so forth;
Now away in the North
My paper artillery lumbers.
I’ve been learning the job while I’ve been
Telling you all about the Machine;
Now I know quite a lot
About powder and shot,
International law and gangrene.
My rank they will never detect
Who read me with humble respect,
For I suddenly rise
’Fore their wondering eyes
And they guess I’m some colonel select.
I’m a popular fraud—more or less,
But the people’s respect for the Press,
And the general rage
For some light at this stage
Keeps me going by hazard and guess.
My editor —such a good chap!—
Says : “Nothing to-night! Will you wrap
It up well, if you can?
I’m too busy, old man.
If you’x-e short you can give ’em a map.”
When it’s over you’ll see me no more ;
I will flicker out just like the war;
But you’ll meet me again
With my hard-working pen
As an expert on old Hebrew lore.
And I hardly need say
(This, of course, by the way)
I know nothing of old Hebrew lore.

Lane Cove.
If she be maid or wanton I never yet have
known,
She draws your heart from others to follow
her alone,
Her pointed red-roofed jetties, her long blue
curves and green,
Her broken links of starshine, the broken
bays between.
If she be maid or wanton I never quite shall
know,
She lies across a memory of sunset’s after-
glow ;
The shadows clear and colorless, the deeps
festooned with foam,
As some swan-shapen steamer churns
through the waters home.
The gum-trees nestle to her, the wharves
have clamped her knees ;
A dream of wild flowers flickers as gold dust
down the breeze,
At night Mort’s Dockyard flaming is like a
threat of Hell
To men who through their lusting are held
beneath her spell.
If she be maid or wanton, I do not think I
care —-
She tricks the purest moonlight to snood her
sweeping hair.
She flings a jest at Sydney with brown arms
in the sea,
“O hungry lips and empty breast, men leave
your bed for me!”
If she be maid or wanton, no man who meets
her cares!
For she has wound a mesh of weed about
him unawares,
A thing of kissing laughter, of tender, croon-
ing cries,
Of dawns of quivering shimmer, of nights of
moon-blanched skies.
If she be maid or wanton her fame goes far
and wide,
For every ferry carries a cargo for her tide —
Past Moftiington, Valentia, past Woolwich
dock, and so
With Cupid crouching at the helm....an
arrow to his bow.

Onward!
Wo are faring towards the Sunset,
We are marching from the east—
We, the greatest and the bravest,
We the meanest and the least.
Let us shout a song together
As we tramp the destined way;
Let us on with dauntless bearing—
We the creatures of a day.
What had shining morn to offer
But a pack of aches and ills?
What had noon but thirst and hunger
And a searing heat that kills?
Look behind —our tracks are reddened
With the thorn-wounds of our feet;
And the sweets which life had promised—
Oh, we found them bitter-sweet.
Where, large-hearted, in the morning
With the hope that youth instils,
We looked forth for level-faring.
There were hills, and hills, and hills.
You. the king—and you, the caitiff.
When your blood was passion-fired,
Had you all your mind ambitioned?
Had you all your heart desired?
Ours the pilot-star that faded,
Ours the hope unsatisfied;
Lo. we ran—our feet were shackled!
Lo, we fought—our hands were tied !
Look the sunset burns with splendor
In the hollow of the skv;
Let us shout a song together.
Fellow-farers. you and I.

“THE BULLETIN” HAS A CENSOR
ON THE PREMISES.
In these days of storm and stress the
Censor has become a familiar feature on
every Australian paper of any size or im-
portance. The Bulletin naturally has one
of the species. By good fortune, he is the
best one. Even “The Old Soldier,” who is so
old that he fought at Sebastopol and helped
to bash the Sepoy in his lair at Delhi, says
so, and he knows things of that sort. The
Censor inspects all pictures, and reads all
proofs, and passes judgment thereon. Dur-
ing the first week of his tenancy he cut the
Editor’s leading article to pieces, and the
Editor, a proud and inflated and bald person
who makes no pretensions to beauty, put up
with the disaster as best he could. It being
the day when the paper went to press, he
didn’t go to lunch as usual at Beach’s cafe,
which is next to Gooch’s liairdressery, but
sent out Frank, the junior, who is a cadet
in his spare time, for a sandwich and eight-
eenpennyworth of whisky (from Pfahleut’s
Hotel), also some soda (Schweppes). Then
lie re-wrote the article during the time usu-
ally devoted to extraneous refreshment. It
passed at the second attempt. The Literary
Editor found his page of reviews and poetry
and discussions on the Higher Culture
severely ruined, and in bitterness of spirit
he fixed up a new page. He refused to share
the Editor’s room and the eighteenpenny-
worth of whisky (Dewar’s whisky) and
the sandwich, so that they might jointly
repair their wasted literary goods. His
excuse was that he didn’t drink, which was
a lie. He was simply too wild to drink.
There was a distribution of language—in-
cluding the language of the Sporting Editor
(of the “Rail and Semaphore” tales) —which
was unpublishable. And the Editor reluc-
tantly handed back to the second Sub-
editor a set of war verses, with the intima-
tion that the Censor couldn’t possibly pass
it because it contained reflections on Mon-
tenegro, and that it wasn’t worth while
showing it to him. The author was asked
if he Could re-write the lines so that they
would refer to Simon Bolivar’s campaigns
in South America, or the execution of Queen
Mary of Scotland. In response lie dashed
his magnum opus in the basket. “Kodak.’
also, Sub-editor, rescued it, and presently
had an inspiration. He re-wrote the work
as a few inspiring lines on Julius s
invasion of Britain. It all vaguely recalled
the unsaleable picture of young George
Washington cutting down a cherry tree
the one which found a market when George
was made an executioner, and the tree was
bent over and turned into Anne Boleyn on
the scaffold.
* * * *■
Right here, and to prevent any omission or
misconception, The Bulletin desires to
say that it likes its Censor. He is a clever
and courteous gentleman, and does his
utmost to make things easy for the staff.
Even when he ruined the Editor’s pet leader
about the alleged drinking habits of a cer-
tain allied potentate, he did it in a way
at which the oldest and bitterest editor
couldn’t take offence. The Censor sits in a
room up two flights of stairs. It is usually
“Hop’s” room, but “Hop” has been away on
a well-earned holiday. There is a narrow
lane at the back, and on the other side of
the lane is the compositors’ room, supervised
by a man of the highest character and capa-
city, with an equally estimable second in
command. At the end of the lane is
a base creature who sells fowls. He
has no connection with the office.
When “Hop” resumes work he and the
Censor will argue about the posses-
sion of the room which looks out on the
back lane adjacent to the premises of the
miscreant who sells fowls. On the other side
of a partition is the sanctum of the Manag-
ing Director. It possesses a commanding
view of over the way, and is situated within
a minute’s walk of the corner of the street.
* * * *
As already mentioned, the entire
Bulletin staff gets on well with the Censor.
No man could be more considerate. Even
the boy who brings up the proofs has
described him as an “all-right bloke.” Still
the fact remains that the Censor is there to
prevent The Bulletin making injudicious
remarks about a war which is half the globe
away. This is a big globe, and it is the
only globe we know. If Australia was the
self-contained continent it should be —if it
did all its own manufacturing, and supplied
all its own requirements, and floated its own
loans, and generally hustled for itself as it
should do—it would take very little interest
in the clamor at the other side of the globe,
and would feel little desire to say anything
about it that a Censor could object to. For
the sake of the Race and the Language it
would assuredly help in the scrimmage. But
there would be no hysteria as there is under
the present Foreign-trade and Foreign-
importing and Foreign-loan policy. There
would be no sudden rush of unemployed, no
closing-up of industries, no arising of red-
rag revolutionaries who want to upset things
in general because they think the bottom is
falling out of things in general, and that
the lid has blown off the top of things in
general. The community would be as calm
and business-like as if it lived in another
planet. No paper would run wild, or feel
any desire to run wild. In the narrow back
lane below The Bulletin Censor’s window
are two obscene tanks for the reception of
waste paper and bottles. Periodically men
(mostly by the name of Smith) who use
loud, subversive language come to remove
the ruins. Their speech is not pleasant for
the Censor to hear, and but for the miser-
able inefficiency of the tariff there is no
reason why he should hear it. With a suffi-
cient scale of duties Australia would be so
busy exporting locally-made pianos to Ice-
land that it would have no time to speak
unkindly about even the King of Montenegro
or the Moderator of the Scotch Presbyterian
Assembly. Consequently there might be
tanks but there wouldn’t be dissension. At
the same time The Bulletin, despite its
Protectionist principles, is almost prepared,
for. the first time in its life, to forgive the
tariff for the sake of the Censor’s company.
This point is mentioned again in case it
should have been overlooked. His billet may
be a matter of some difficulty, but the holder
of the billet is a man and a brother.
Australia is sending away troops, or col-
lecting troops for local defence, or assem-
bling cadets, or borrowing money or some-
thing. The Bulletin frankly admits that
it has no special or exclusive information as
to what anybody is doing or where anybody
is going. After spending some good money
—which might have been much better em-
ployed in raising the salary of the capable
and attractive lady who runs the Woman’s
Letter one floor above the Censor’s office, or
the man who looks after the stiffened horse
and the muddied oaf, or the hard-working
and conscientious mechanical staff buried in
the basement, or the brilliant and artistic
creature who is located at the extreme top
of the premises—after spending this money
in search of special knowledge it got no reli-
able special knowledge whatsoever.. Of rumors
it acquired many, and the worst-looking of
them was that Switzerland had declared war
against Bolivia. Just at this crisis The
Bulletin was informed in pencil on 2in.
of paper by the Censor’s Head Office that it
must not, on any account, give away the
secret. It hadn’t any secret. The beastly
thing doesn’t exist.
* * * *
If you emerge from the Censor’s door and
absent-mindedly take two turns to the right
you may wander through an opening and
fall a great distance into the lane already
hinted at, and on to the head of a person
who owns a dray, two horses, a whip and
many coarse epithets. This scurrilous
ruffian represents Foreign Commerce. He is
trying to deliver imported paper at the
door of the machine-room, presided over by
a man whose good qualities are too numer-
ous to mention. Australia doesn’t make its
own paper in anything like sufficient quan-
tities. If you go right ahead on leaving the
Censor’s door you walk across a dimly-
lighted space into the office of the Literary
Critic. From his window you can look
across George-street to a vacant allotment.
And there or thereabouts is generally to be
seen the Oldest Person on Earth trying to
sell bootlaces out of a mouldy perambulator.
He also represents Foreign Commerce, for
the bootlaces are imported. Australia doesn’t
make enough bootlaces to supply its own
needs. (Incidentally the very, very old and
faded merchant always refuses charity, and
declines to reveal his past. It is supposed
by some that he is James IV. of Scotland,
and that he wasn’t really killed at Flodden,
but went into retirement.) In the dimly-
lighted space already referred to —the one
between the Censor’s door and the Literary
Critic’s door —is a poet trying to borrow
3d. He stands for Ilis-h Finance—for the
great Loan Policy. They are all appro-
priately placed. They are the embodiment
of the indirect yet potent influences which
drive this community Jo “lose its block’’ at
the first sound of strife; and cast mad asper-
sions on the legitimacy of the Shah of
Persia or the table manners of the Akhoond
of Swat. If the profane person at the back
and the venerable person in front and the
threepenny-borrowing person in between
were all killed —or, rather, if the poli-
tical principles they embody were killed
—The Bulletin would receive its
Censor’s resignation in his present capacity.
Then it would offer him a permanent posi-
tion on the staff rather than lose him alto-
gether. This may seem like repetition, but
the truth is mighty and will assuredly pre-
vail. It can’t prevail too often.
[James Edmond, 214 George-strcet, Sydney.]
THE SKIN OF THE BEAR.
Dear Bulletin, —There is a worn-out say-
ing—it never was much of a saying even
when it was new—that the above-mentioned
article shouldn’t be sold until the angry
meat inside it is dead. The proverb is good
up to a certain point, but then it fails. The
other side of the case is that no wise hunter
goes after his bruin unless he has some idea
where to find a market for the skin.
Failing that, it is policy to make
the best possible peace with the enemy,
and meet it half-way, and to let not
the sun go down on the beast’s wrath.
In the present great European upheaval of
five nations against two it would be prema-
ture to say that our alliance will win, but it
assuredly looks like winning. And if there
is a decisive victory it is certain that the
map of Europe will be torn up and recon-
structed in a wholesale fashion, such as
hasn’t been dreamed of since the garish days
of the Big Napoleon —not the short-legged,
dreamy little Napoleon, of dubious parent-
age, who came after him. Assuming the bear
to be dead and skinned and left lying as an
uneatable object amid the dust and the ants
of the roadside, a whole lot of interest gathers
round the hide.
“ * * * *
Russia threw a memorable brick into the
enemy’s camp when it announced the recon-
struction of Poland —the rebuilt State to
have its own language and laws and its Parlia-
ment and army and religion, with a Russian
viceroy as the sole link between Warsaw and
St. Petersburg. The great ambition of
Poland, now cut up in three divisions under
three foreign rulers, is to get together again
and to secure all the freedom and self-govern-
ment and national identity that it can. It
is ready to throw in its influence with the
State that bids highest in these respects. The
Austrian Emperor couldn’t invite Russian
and German Poland to break away from then-
masters and unite under his wing, for that
would have meant a declaration of war
against his one and only ally, the Kaiser at
Berlin. Germany couldn’t buy Polish sup-
port by inviting the Russian and Austrian
fragments of the old so-called “republic” to
come in with it and be free and united and
glorious. That would have been a declara-
tion of war against its solitary ally, the Old
Man at Vienna. But Russia, with both
Kaisers against it, could play the game of
Polish nationalism for all it was worth. By
doing so it might make things a lot better, and
it could hardly make them any worse.
Apparently the scheme caught on, and the
Poles are now pro-Russian to a man. In
Germany and Austria they are just as valu-
able supports to the Government as if they
were a horde of maddened Israelites in Egypt
before Exodus.
Exactly what is meant by a reconstructed
Poland is hard to say. If the term implies
the restoration of the old kingdom, or “re-
public,” as it was in its prime, there will be
a marvellous slab cut off both Prussia and
Austria, and the remains of them will pre-
sent a surprising aspect on the map. But as
Poland once held a sort of suzerainty over
practically all Prussia, and its territories
extended northward till they joined on to
Sweden and eastward till they approached
Asia, the complete restoration and recon-
struction would be too gigantic a job.
Whether Poland will remain contented and
enthusiastic under the new order of things,
provided the new order is established—that
is to say, assuming it is the right bear
that dies, and that it dies dead enough, and
that the hide is sold in a rising market—is
another matter. Probably it won’t remain
either contented or enthusiastic. There
will, most likely, be a period of dazzle and
applause and flag-flapping, during which it
will be -impossible for a Pole and a Russian
to meet without buying drinks for each
other. Then there will be a period of settling
down and cooling off. Next will arise sus-
picions and recriminations. Finally there
will be a repetition of the case of the British
colonists of New England and Virginia, who
objected as bitterly to -the easy-going British
rule as if it had been a serpent or an Inqui-
sition ; or the case of the old vice-royalty of
Mexico, where a kindly, feckless, well-mean-
ing, slovenly set of Spanish governors thought
they had gained the undying affections of the
people, and discovered that they had only
acquired vast public disapprobation. Fifty
years hence—or 20 years hence—a revived
and regenerated Poland may possibly be
clamoring to its old Prussian tyrants to help
it in the work of bashing its regenerator.
The Poles are an unstable race. When one
of their best kings came back, wounded but
covered with glory, after saving the country
from what looked like imminent destruction,
a large section of the Diet expressed a hope
that he might die, because such a strong man
might be "a danger to the nobles and the
blessed Constitution. And when about the
worst of the imported kings fled because he
couldn’t stand either the climate or the
society, he was chased right to the border
and even home to Paris, by a deputation
which wanted him to come back. The depu-
tation said that Poland couldn’t enjoy either
its sleep or its victuals in his absence.
* * * *
Italy has cheerfully and off-handedly
abandoned its allies of the Triple League.
It will presumably come in—on the
other side —and try to annex the whole
of Austria’s coastline. If that hap-
pens, the less sai 1 about the remains of Aus-
tria the better, for it isn’t likely that rest-
less Bohenra. and Hungary and Croatia will
then stand to it much longer. All the
Austrian coastline is described by fervent
Italian patriots as “unredeemed Italy.” The
country thereabouts was part of Italy in
Homan times, and some of it was part of
Italy during the great days of the Venetian
republic. The whole Balkan peninsula is
unredeemed Italy if we go back to Roman
days. Likewise a great part of Greece is
unredeemed Italy twice over, for long after
the Romans lost it the Venetians regained
it, and lost it again. Likewise the Balkan
peninsula is unredeemed Greece, and Servia,
and Turkey and Macedonia, for it has been
owned by almost everybody in turn. And a
great part of the land vaguely described as
Macedonia once belonged to Lombards
from Italy; and a great part of Greece was
possessed for quite a while by the French;
and Constantinople was once owned by a
Belgian king—he was called Flemish in
those days. It is sarid that the Bulgarian's
cut off his feet and hands and rolled him
down a gully. Also, if one goes back to
the very old records, London and Paris and
Madrid are unredeemed Italy, and Berlin is
a lost fragment of Holland, and Holland is.
a lost fragment of Germany—not the new
Germany of Berlin, but the old Germany
of Frankfort, or possibly Vienna. In fact,,
almost every place in Europe belongs to
somebody else, or to everybody else, if the-
grey-haired stories are hunted up. The:
essential fact is that any place belongs to
anybody who can take it. Italy’s claim to>
recover its unredeemed provinces will be
good, if Italy bumps manfully into the fight
against its old friend Austria when the oldl
friend is used up. Austria has only the
smallest possible bit of coastline, while-
Italy is almost all coast; but that makes no>
difference to the fact that Italy wants Aus-
tria’s scrap of shore.
* * * *
And if Unredeemed Italy is recovered,
the balance of things, so far as the boot-
shaped kingdom is concerned, will move a
little further east. Therefore Venice may
begin to dream of being the capital instead
of Rome. Venice has no very great use for
Rome in any case. Some of its people—
gondoliers and hotel porters and other
robbers—even expectorate violently when the
Eternal City is mentioned.*
If the bear —the joint bear of Central
Europe—is really killed, and the pelt is
fairly divided, France will, of course get
back the territory it lost in 1871. Whether
it will get anything more is a different
question. It would be a great idea if
France acknowledged that its republic is a
stodgy, uninspiring, middle-class affair, with
an uninspiring green cotton umbrella under
its arm. It might pay France to become a >
monarchy again, and elect Albert of Bel-
gium as its king, and thus unite the two.
countries, just as England and Scotland!
were united when the big State accepted!
the shambling monarch of the small State •
as its ruler. Later on the big State ejected!
the descendants of the shambling monarch i
who came from the small State, but the-
union still held good, and the device had!
served its purpose. It was rough on the;
posterity of the shambling monarch, which-,
might have held on to one kingdom and!
instead lost three; but the grandsons of bow--
legged and ineffective potentates have to
fight their own battles.
* * * *
It isn’t likely that Denmark will get any
spoils out of the present scrimmage. The
three German duchies wirreh it lost to Prus-
sia after the war of 1864 may like Prussia
none too well, but they certainly like their
old Danish tyrants no better. Whether
the southern States of the German Empire
—the States which always sympathised more
or less with Austria and always hated the
Prussian “junker” with a very solid hatred
—will stand by the empire when the star of
Kaiser William Hoiienzollern sets, or
whether they will break away and set up
for themselves in the old fashion, is an
open question. The Prussian is hardly a
German in reality, and his domination of
Germany has never been popular. He was:
still “the Prussian heathen” when all the rest
of Europe was more or less civilised. The small:
respectable States that lead a decent life,,
and don’t drink, and go to bed early, such;
as Holland, Norway, Sweden and Switzer-
land. have no great hope of collecting loot..
No large accessions of territory are looked!
for by Andorra or Monaco —the latter is;
the place that lives on the profits of the-
Monte Carlo gamble. In the Balkans the
last remains of the Unspeakable Turk are
liable at any moment to be eaten on gen-
eral principles—he and his palace and his
harem and his fez and all his goods. AVhich-
ever way things may go there will certainty
be a new. map of Europe and a great re-dis-
tribution of colonies. Also, there will almost
certainly be a great disarmament, and a very
great saving of money, and a great peace.
Amid the general cahn the Jews will recover
Palestine, and put Solomon Isaacs on the
throne. They will build the Hebrew fleet —
the last one having been lost in the harbor of
Ezion-geber in the days of Jeiiosiiaphat.
And just as the Hebrew fleet is raising its
anchor for its first voyage some Buriat or
other bad character in Asia will learn that
Europe has disarmed, and he will come and
take the country. Whereupon Europe will
remark, in its last moments, that per-
haps peace may be overdone, after all. Still,
whichever wav things may go, it is worth
while to be alive just now, despite the high
cost of living. It would be a dreadful thing
to be buried and miss all these happenings.

Incidentally it may be remarked once more
that the bear isn’t dead yet.—Yours, etc.,

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The High Prices of Imports.
The proposal of N.S.W. Premier Holman,
tliat prices shall be regulated by Act of
Parliament while the unlucky war lasts, is
one of those cheap devices to which that
clean-shaven man of show and frill is much
addicted. He quoted, as the reason for his
proposition, that trade figures, in a number
of lines, have already been boosted out of
reason. But all the articles he quoted were
imported goods, so the country is faced with
two alternative explanations, which really
boil down to one explanation. Either the
importer, whom Holman, the Foreign-trader*


I:as always encouraged, is a mercenary
scoundrel who lakes advantages of the coun-
try’s necessities to needlessly increase his
demands in a moment of excitement because
we haven’t learned to manufacture for our-
selves. In that case he shouldn’t be encour-
aged. Or else the import system, which
Holman, the Foreign-trader, has always
approved, is a failure, because so soon as the
factories of Europe are crippled through men
being called away to war, our people, not
having learned to make the goods themselves,
are afflicted with scarcity. Australia hasn’t
seen a hostile soldier or a hostile ship. It
hasn’t heard a gun fired in anger. It
has lost neither a town nor a man nor a
jumbuck nor a rabbit nor a blade of grass
because of the gigantic upheaval in Europe.
It hasn’t been despoiled of a ship ; and, in-
cidentally, it has gained some ships, because
German vessels which weren’t furnished with
wireless telegraphy have wandered unwit-
tingly into its ports and been seized. It has,
so far, not paid an extra penny in war taxes.
Yet on account of its easy, lazy, loafing,
swollen-headed Foreign-trade and foreign-
loan habits, it is already getting into a bad
way. It finds a shortage of foreign imported
goods, because some 7,000,000 or 9,000,000
men who used to make these goods have gone
to the war. It couldn’t pay for the goods
if it got them, because the foreign loans
with which it used to pay for them can’t be
floated at this time of stress. A whole lot
of the raw or partially-prepared materials
which should be finished in Australia by Aus-
tralian artisans, and afterwards used by Aus-
tralian citizens, are now a dead loss, the
German buyer to whom we have grovelled
so long on Foreign-trade principles being, for
the time, off the market. Again. Australians
are out of work because the German can’t
pay cash for the roots and ores which we
ought to employ in our own factories. The
materials are all here, and the possibilities
are all here, but the common sense isn’t here;
so this great, rich, gold-producing continent
promises to be in a bad way. At this crisis
Premier Holman, as already indicated,
comes along with a crude, hulking supposi-
tion like an enlarged blowfly, to the effect
that the merchant who doesn’t supply a tin
of imported fish or a parcel of foreign
chiffons at the old price shall fall in heavily.
Considering all the circumstances it might
be more to the point to enact that unless
Holman imports loans at the old price he
shall fall in heavily and get 12 months’ gaol.
The Foreign-trade policy of which the
N.S.W. statesman is an apostle has made
Australia equally dependent on imported hats
and petticoats and on imported money. Hol-
man is the biggest single importer in New
South Wales. The spectacle of that person
reproving the small importer because prices
have ascended is calculated to make the
angels howl.

About Prices.
Dear Bulletin, —When you see a trader
put up the price of anything the proper
thing is to yell at him. You are supposed
to finish the argument in triumph when you
point out that he had bought the stock before
the w T ar, and now he wants 20 per cent,
over his old price. This, besides proving
him to be a brigand, throws a dark cloud
on liis patriotism. Generally he makes a
lame excuse —-probably mumbles something
about “law of supply and demand,” which
lie has been taught to hide behind on all
occasions. He could make out a far better
case for himself if he knew how. As he
doesn’t know how, he goes on charging the
extra money, and feels more like a worm
every time he picks up his morning paper
and reads the alleged truth about himself.
It probably doesn’t occur to him that he is
getting a mighty poor penn’orth from his
daily paper these times. Before the war
the news-runner used to reduce his prize
geranium to a wreck with a 24-page mass
of literature. To-day there’s a slender
eight-page bomb, and his evening paper is
down to four sheets. Why? Simply because
stocks of paper are very short, and the
news merchants don’t know when they will
be able to get any more. True, they still
charge the old penny; but they give
much less for the penny. Yet they had their
present stocks in hand when the war started.
Brigands! Unpatriotic scoundrels! Don’t
they know that England still has command
of the sea? What are they worrying about?
What is aui/body worrying about? That’s
the theory of it, at any rate. The practice
of it works out like this. A trader (it’s
an actual and typical case) had a fair stock
—not a big one, for, like thousands of others
the firm has its balance and stock-taking
at June 30. Four consignments were on
the water to him. None of them has yet
•arrived. Two are hung up in other Aus-
tralian ports, one is in Java (in the Boon,
which skedaddled north), the fourth is he
.doesn’t know where. He paid for those
things in London. Interest and other
.charges are adding enormously to the cost,
: and some of the goods won’t be any use
•when he gets them. Meantime he is empty-
ing the petty-cash box in paying for cables.
:He asked America for goods when the war
and America quoted prices so dizzy
(that he couldn’t see the top of them, and
(even then wouldn’t guarantee delivery within
anv specified time. When the Admiralty
said all was well at sea, he turned to Eng-
land. He found (as most other merchants
have found) that quotations had jumped
about 20 per cent., delivery uncertain.
Throw bricks at the trader, if you like, on
general principles ; only give him an assur-
ance that when the war is over you’ll cheer-
fully go on paying the 20 or 30 or 50 per
cent, extra that the stock he then has on
hand will have cost him. Meantime, ask
the virtuous newspaper, which is shocked
these unpatriotic tactics, why it isn’t

The Banks, the War, and the Out-of-
Works.
We have heard nearly enough about this
.country’s magnificent gold reserves. The
.country’s magnificent gold reserves, like its
magnificent natural resources, are no use
(unless they are made use of. And they are
not being made use of to their full extent.
They are mostly lying in the banks, because
the banks will not set them spinning. The
banks, no doubt, are protecting themselves.
They know very well that there need be no
visible run on a bank to send it to the wall.
The idea that a smash only results from a
clamoring crowd demanding gold money for
paper money is quite foolish. The process
that these institutions have to guard against
is more silent and insidious. In the larger
cities there is what is called a bankers’ pool
—a gold fund contributed to by each bank in
proportion, generally, to its turnover. When
Jones draws a cheque for £lO payable to
Smith, Smith’s bank (to which it has been
sent for collection) puts it and a score or
hundred others into the hands of a junior
clerk, who takes it to the pool. There
Jones’s bank has £lO debited against its
proportion of the pool, and Smith’s bank
gets £lO credited to it. Obviously if
Jones’s bank was giving credit freely, while
other banks were sitting tight or “keeping
dry,” there would be so many transfers from
its gold in the pool that its funds there would
run out; and before that happens it would be
called upon to replenish. No two or three
banks can therefore risk giving credit freely
while the others are giving little or none;
it would simply mean that, while the gold
reserves which we have heard so much about
lately would be in the aggregate just as great
as ever they were, the two or three banks
would be bled white. In the absence, then,
of a general agreement between Australian
banks to come to one another’s assistance and
prevent the failure of any of them, the insti-
tutions are husbanding their resources. They
don’t know what demands may be made upon
them presently: in order to save their best
accounts they may later on have to pay out
freely. Until then they are mostly “dry”;
and that accounts for the stoppage of works
wholesale. The Bulletin doesn’t suppose
that the banks are at all times wholly
responsible. Customers who are faced with
the spending of money which they must
presently repay may want a few days to
think things over. But in a time like this
it seems to be the duty of the banker, not
perhaps to go out with a lasso as in the old
days of the boom and drag the borrower in,
but at least to take the initiative and offer
a means of carrying business on as usual.
That there has not, so far, been much of this
disposition is pretty well proved by the
general stoppage of work at Australian pro-
ductive mines. As has been reported already,
the Commonwealth has undertaken to go to
the assistance of the banks when help is
needed, and supply them with legal-tender
money to the extent of three times the amount
of any gold they may lodge. This is an
excellent scheme, and if put into practice
would relieve the banks of the necessity for
exercising that extreme caution which they
now seem to believe the occasion calls for.
But something more than that is required.
The Commonwealth does not make this offer
to the banks merely to ensure the latter’s
comfort and safety. It rather offers them
a means by which they may give ' much
greater help to the manufacturing, produc-
ing and other interests of the country. Tf
they can give that help without recourse to
the Commonwealth, well and good. But, one
way or the other, they are plainly called upon
to give help. And the sooner it is realised
that every factory closed, every productive
mine idle, and every payable job stopped, is
prima facie a reflection on the banking
system of this country, and the men in charge
of. it, the better. Their business in this
crisis is to carry things on. If they want
the help of the Commonwealth’s credit, they
have only to ask and they will receive. If
what has been offered is not enough, nothing
is surer than that more would be forth-
coming. But if they don’t ask they cannot
hide behind the excuse that they did what
they could.
Chorus Girls and Their Troubles.
The “respectability” of small wage earners
(mostly smart young women) in the theatri-
cal trade will always be under grave sus-
picion as long as the managers are permitted
to remain outside the radius of labor legisla-
tion. Stage hands and workers in front of
the house have their union, likewise the
orcliestrians, who are a comparatively well-
paid section of the polite industrial class.
But the chorus and ballet-girls are at the
mercy of the paymaster. Supply of labor ex-
ceeds demand in this unique trade, from
which all considerations of fair play have been
' banished by the employers’ union. Equally
from an economic and moral point of view,
the conditions are scandalous, and it is only
because Capital offers the gratification of
human vanity to its bedazzled servants that
this exploiting of selected talent and physical
charms can be continued. The living-wage
law which gives the worker a measure of
protection in other industries is not enforced
in the public-entertainment manufacturing
trade. Nominally the wage of chorus and
ballet-girls is 50s. a week during a co.’s
seasons in the big cities, and 555. a week
when it is on tour. Needless to say that a
panto, or comic-opera repertoire season is the
girls’ best time. A panto, will run, perhaps,
many weeks in a city where the home of a
fatuous fairy is located, and, although she
has to give four weeks’ services in prelimi-
nary rehearsal ere her salary begins, she is
doing fairly well. Touring is another matter.
Moreover the panto, and comic-opera girls
are the favored members of the sisterhood as
compared with the extra ladies of a dramatic
company. The metropolitan seasonsof the latter
are short, and their tours are long. The days
spent in travelling, like the weeks spent in
rehearsal, are financial blanks to the girls.
Their boat and railway fates are paid, but
for the luxury of a sleeping-berth on a long
railway journey they must pay their own
10s. a night out of the salary which is sus-
pended for, perhaps, a week. The sea-jour-
ney necessitates tips to stewards, for the poor
chorus girl is not exempt from social obliga-
tions. Maybe the boat trip extends from
Melbourne to Fremantle, and after six
salaryless days on the water the co. arrives
on a Wednesday. The girls cannot start
work in Perth before Saturday, and on the
following Friday they get the first 555. they
have seen for a fortnight or more. Another
non-productive time of travel is impending.
Meanwhile they have incurred 10 days of
boarding expenses at the cheapest pub where
they can get any change at all out of their
555. In the case of a broken week the life of
these struggling tourists is sometimes embit-
tered by a dispute with the management. Biz
has been sickly, and the treasurer offers the
girls fl for three nights’ work, before being
shamed (or worried) into paying what is
really due. All along the line the girls are
defenceless. They have no contract, nor, for
that matter, can any but the foremost actors
get contracts in this country. They can be
fired out of the job at a week’s notice, and
they are likely to be fired if trade is slack.
A case could be instanced where a co. was
engaged by a certain manager on a vague
verbal promise of six months’ employment,
but after two nights’ trial of the piece the
week’s notice was pasted. The co. gave
weeks of rehearsal for an engagement which
lasted only eight nights. It not infrequently
happens that some of the girls and men hired
for chorus parts on a big spectacular produc-
tion are thrown out of work in a week or
two, after losing a month in rehearsal. The
piece is a frost. Expenses are cut down.
Towards the end of the Second week the
crowd on the stage and the fiddlers in the
orchestra are fewer than before. The dis-
charged girls have bfeen paid about £4 for a
job which kept them at the theatre several
hours a day for six weeks. When the girls
are “resting,” they can’t afford to be lazy
and lose their suppleness. They must keep
in practice and pay dancing fees to their
teacher. It is she who gets applications for
girls to fill vacancies, and her paying pupils
get first consideration, of course.. For the
girl who goes into this rotten business with
the set purpose of getting a living there is
nothing in it but chronic impecuniosity. or
chronic disrespectability. For the others
there is disillusionment and disgust. For all
there is gross injustice.
War, the Peacemaker.
War is a ghastly calamity, but, evidently,
when it gets going on a really big scale, it
may be productive of much good. It sweeps
away, if only for a time, all the frauds and
shams and things that don’t matter. _ The
last few weeks have seen a holocaust of imbe-
cilities which had lasted so long that they
had grown to institutions. The first to go
was Party Government. Party Government
is about as popular just now as Anarchy.
W. A. Watt, ex-Premier of Victoria, came over
to Sydney last week and made a few harmless
remarks concerning the alleged difference
between the Labor and Liberal policies—
remarks which a month ago would have been
acclaimed as perfectly correct by every daily
paper. He had forgotten that the new spirit
was abroad. He was immediately jumped
upon from every imaginable direction. He
was accused of being “paltry,” “unworthy”
and “incapable of rising to a great occasion.”
W. M. Hughes, the “irresponsible Socialist”
of previous elections, was held up before him
as an exemplar of level-headed patriotism.
All these intolerable rebukes because Watt
had raised the Party issue. The people who,
in normal times, spurn the idea of Elective
Ministries —a system, namely, under which
the most capable men of all parties shall
administer the affairs of the country are
now solemnly warning the Federal candidates
that whichever side wins on September 5,
there must be a coalition. In other words,
since there is serious work to be done, the
country requires what amounts to an Elec-
tive Ministry. The last, lingering Anti-
Defenceite vanished with the declaration of
war by Britain. The more property he
had the more utterly he departed into
oblivion. No one has a word to say against
what some people call “Conscription” now.
The only regret is that the folks who
denounced it as “un-English” six years ago
Avex-e allowed to hold the movement up to
such purpose that to-day the oldest of our
compulsory trainees are still boys. Of the
local navy, the S. M. Herald was impelled
to speak as follows (19/8/’l4) :
One thing which the war has established beyond
dispute is the wisdom of the policy which created
the Australian navy. Not only has our navy relieved
the mother country of. the responsibility of defending
our' local trade and coastal cities, but if the Aus-
tralian fleet had not been built the position of this
continent would have been anything but pleasant.
So one may take it that the theory that
Australia is best defended in the North Sea
has been scrapped for good, and that the
subscribers to the Dreadnought Fund realise
that the creation of a local fleet was the best
insurance that was ever effected on ' their
properties. The current issues of the Lon-
don panel’s are full of sensational, howls
concerning the impending “Rebellion in
Ulster.” A month ago the rebellion story
was on the verge of being taken seriously.
At the first breath of serious trouble the
bogus agitation fell completely dead, leaving
Nationalists and Ulsterites boon com,panions-
in-arms, and the Home Rule question to be
settled amicably by peaceful means.
Genuine rebellions, causes Avhich are really
vital, don’t blow out in that sudden fashion.
The Great War has tested the Ulster agita-
tion, and the latter has emerged from the cru-
cible a mere party row, of about the same
status as Disestablishment or Land Taxation.
Before the war The Bulletin insisted,
over and over again, that the soundest
patriotism, from an Imperial standpoint,
was for Australia to see that its meat went
to Smithfield, in preference to Chicago.
This paper’s theory was that once the beef
and mutton of this, the only meat-exporting
country which is free from the control of
the U.S. Beef Trust, started in large quan-
tities for the States, it would be a black day
for the meat-consumers of the United King-
dom. Before the war the cattle kings of
Australia could see no virtue in that theory.
Last week Kidman, the largest of them,
attended in person before the Meat Com-
mission, and urged the Commissioner to pre-
vent further supplies of meat being sent to
the U.S., pointing out that enormous con-
signments had already been arranged for,
that more orders were pouring in, and that
Britain was going to suffer in consequence.
And when the Commissioner explained that
he had no powers in the matter, the big beef
man was both shocked and grieved. Before
the war the fixing of prices was regarded as
visionary Socialism. At the present moment
prices are being fixed everywhere. Before
the war Peace Societies flourished. To-day
no one is so humorless as to discuss the
Palace at the Hague, in connection with its
old associations. Industrial troubles have
ended all over the world. Class bitterness
has decreased. The French Government has
invited the expatriated nuns to return and
resume their old job of attending to the
wounded. Wherever one looks —so long as
it is not in the direction of a battle-field —-
there is an atmosphere of kindliness and
toleration and common sense. Will it last
when the tragedy is over, or will it go the
way of those good resolutions which people
make when they are ill, and enthusiastically
abandon as soon as they get better?
[John Bede Dalley, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
The Bulletin endeavors to keep calm in
this time of stress, and to do its duty to its
country. Yet there are times when it feels
inclined to curse the Government of its
country with no small energy and a very
large amount of denunciation. One of the
great essentials in war is a good supply of
gold, because gold speaks all languages, and
if Australia has to send out an expedition
one of these days to help our Russian allies
in the defence of Omsk or Tomsk or Tobolsk
or Irkutsk there must be actual coin with
which to pay the army’s way in foreign
parts. Therefore a great deal is said —but
unhappily very little is done—about the im-
portance of conserving the local gold supply
by the use of notes. On Wednesday last
week a Bulletin man explained at the
Federal money-order department in Sydney
that he would take the amount of the P. 0.0.
in Federal 10s. notes, and he couldn’t get
them. On Thursday the same man was
drawing a few pounds out of the Federal
Government Savings Bank, and it proved
that the institution had seven Federal 10s.
notes on the premises. Even these were only
found after a struggle. The customer took
six of them, and bade the Department keep
the odd one on the chance that it would
grow. Now, if the Australian Government
won’t push its own currency, or even make a
decent pretence of having its currency on
hand when wanted, does it expect somebody
else to do its work for it?
According to State Premier Holman
(N.S.W.) the stock of gold in the Australian
banks is a record, and the financial outlook
is “most reassuring.” If the basis of this re-
assurance wasn’t hollow, then all would be
well. But during the first half of the prer
sent year Australia imported goods to the
value of £39,592,309. And in order to pay
for these goods it exported to the value fof
only £35,058,610. That is to say, it paid
for over £1,500,000 worth of its imports out of
foreign loans, and it paid all the interest it
owes on its public and private foreign debts,
and all the rents it owes to absentee landlords,
and all the dividends of foreign shareholders
(roughly estimated now at £16,000,000 per
annum when the lot are added up) out of
foreign loans. So the country, aided by peace
and good seasons and good prices, prospered
considerably. Working hours were shortened.
Wages went up. Money accumulated. Australia
was in the blessed position of a country
which owned some £300,000,000 worth of
public works which hadn’t cost it any of
its own capital, and yet it was a country
which paid no interest and had an income
coming in. In other words, it was living at
the rate of £lO,OOO a minute on other
people’s funds. But if the war makes an
abrupt ending of the loans there will be- a
period of long hours and hard work and bitter
economy ahead, and even then the garish
stock of gold about which the egregious Hol-
man prates, as if he had supplied the gold
out of his own pocket, will almost certainly
diminish very fast. Supposing .the foreign
loans ceased, the stock would last about a
year. Supposing they diminished so far that
Australia was called upon only to pay its in-
terest out of its own earnings, the much be-
lauded pile of sovereigns would last a little
over two years. Holman belongs to the
class of politicians which sells posterity into
bondage in order to buy votes. When his
financial curse comes home to roost he will
disappear and be never- more heard of, except
perhaps at the soup kitchen. And there are
others of his sort.
♦
Arthur Kidman, a gentleman in the dead
bullock trade, appeared the other day before
a Royal Commission in Sydney, and proposed
that, while the war lasts, the export of food
from Australia to foreign countries should be
stopped, so that the people may have inexpen-
sive victuals. It is a showy and cheaply
patriotic proposition, but how does Kidman
suppose the miserably indebted country is to
keep solvent if anything of the sort happens?
It has to pay for its imports, which, in pro-
portion to the population, are the biggest
on earth. It depends on outsiders for steel
rails and ships and for a thousand other
things, including most of the clothes which
conceal its nakedness. It has also to pay
about £16,000,000 a year as interest on its
old debts, which are the price of its old
dissipations. And, apart from a completely
insufficient output of gold and silver, the only
things it can pay with are wheat, flour,
butter, cheese, ham, bacon, beef, mutton.

I shout no song of a blood-stained Flag
Or a Navy’s vaunted might;
Of no brave feats of arms I brag
In fights I did not fight.
But when I hear “God Save the King”
By friends and comrades sung
My heart beats time
To the tawdry rhyme,
For “King” to me, in this far-off clime,
Spells “Anglo-Saxon Tongue.”
The waves I’d have Britannia rule
Are the waves of thought and sound ;
I’d have our language taught in school
The whole God’s earth around.
The brotherhood of speech I preach
To children old and young:
For nations still
Shall war and kill
Till time has worked .TeiiovaiTs will—
One world, one creed, one Tongue.
From Britain’s shores, south, east and
west
The seeds of peace have blown :
Where birds of freedom build their nest
Our Language builds its throne.
And all and each these words may reach,
From Pickwick pen outflung,
Are subject to
A monarch who
Has done great work, and more shall do.

they have discovered. Phormoid possesses
astonishing properties for feeding the nerve

becoming excessively fat under this treat-

anybody to accept the lOU’s. The proposal
to stop the export of foodstuffs to foreign
countries during the war, so that this coun-
try will have plenty of cheap provender,
means blank insolvency. If failure to pay
the interest bill, and the consequent creation
of a huge panic and downfall in the United

[James Edmond, 214 Geovge-street, Sydney.]
“Bumper” writes: —
The High Court by majority (Griffith, Duffy and
Rich) dismissed the Crown appeal in the case
against Ravenscrdft, owner of a slot machine which
traded cigarettes on a Manly steamer on a Sunday.
The Chief Justice, in the majority judgment, found
that the slot business, being a mechanical act, did
not import a personal deed or omission on the part
of a human actor (in other words, that the owner
wasn’t liable for the performances of his slot
machine). It was further held that Section 61 of
the Sunday Observance Act held good only in regard
of something involving Sunday labor on the part of
some person. Justice Isaacs dissented. He gave, in
my humble opinion, a lucid exposition of the false
reasoning of the majority of the Court. He could
not see any reason to prevent (if the case was pushed
to its logical conclusion), shops, streets, arcades,
etc., fitting up slot machines to sell on Sunday every-
thing that the law at great pains has laid down
must not be sold on Sunday. It seems to me that if
a man can do by mechanical means on the Day of
Rest what he cannot do by personal means, he should
be within his rights to sell beer after 11 p.m. per
medium of a mechanical barman. The slot machine,
now crowfied with the halo of righteousness, could
dispose of adulterated goods, and the law would have
no redress against the owner or person who reaped a
profit thereby. If a slot machine can legally do
what it likes, when it likes, how it likes, while the
person or persons collecting the takings is above the
law, then it is clearly time for the law to get a
hammerlock on the slot machine and teach it better
manners.
Some one ought to advertise, in these days
of stress and tumult, for Miss Rose Scott,
of Sydney, and the other Peace Society folk,
and the Quakers, and the Non-Resisters.
Always and most strenuously they have
preached the doctrine that Defence is a sin
and an absurdity, and that nobody will ever
attack us if we are decent and friendly, we
being the one people on earth who can, by
any chance, commit any offence against an-
other Power. If we walk the chalk-line of
rectitude —we being the only aggressive folk
on earth—everything, they hold, must be
right. Now Belguim, a little State which
never declared war on anybody, is fighting
for its life. And the Germans are demand-
ing huge indemnities from its cities —such
indemnities as, if they were required from
Sydney and Melbourne, would compel Miss
Rose Scott and her friends to sell their
spare clothes and their boots and their furni-
ture and their bread and cheese and their
bedding in order to make up their share of
the exaction. It is a great thing to be
peaceful if the other fellow will be peaceful
also. If the other fellow won’t be peaceful
the Peace Society lady has to be very
humble to him when he comes along, and has
to pawn her hat and her umbrella, and her
frills so that she may contribute to the
enemy’s war expenses. The theory that no
elephant ever treads on a worm unless the
worm attacks it first may be very beautiful
and very pious, but in the end it is very bad
for the worm. Australia much requires an
Act of Parliament providing for the deporta-
tion of Miss Rose Scott and all her tribe
to Liege or Mulhausen—the places where the
Real Thing is happening.
Some jests and blunders are immortal. As
a case in point, Granville Ryrie. M.L.A.,
a Tory of N.S.W., included this item in a
long shriek of denunciation which he directed
against the Federal Labor party in last
Monday’s Sydney Telegraph :
If Mr. Fisher had had his way we would have been
the laughing stock of the world, because his proposal,
which he did not even endeavor to give practical
effect toV was to build a flotilla of small boats of the
river type, which was rightly styled “Fisher’s mos-
quito fleet,” and which would have been worse than
useless in the present crisis; one German cruiser
would have blown the whole lot of them out of the
water.
Even at this late hour it apparently hasn’t
come to Ryrie’.s knowledge that a “River”
ship, in naval lingo, isn’t a craft intended
to potter about a river, but one of a certain
type which, in the British navy, are named
after rivers. Most of them have .apparently
dropped out now, but there is still a Shannon
of 14,600 tons, and a Sutlej, of 12,000 tons,
on the list. Now, who was it that first in-
vented profound ignorance?

Brethren, our lesson to-day will be taken
from the parable of “The Sledge Hammer,”
in the first chapter of the Book of the
Sydney Adelphi according to St. George
Willoughby. And behold, one Matthew Der-
rick, who had two sons, Simon and Jacob
(he also had a wife, but she died before
George met the family) took unto himself
a second wife named Martha. She bore
him another son, Everard, who was to be
the hero of the show. And Simon and
Jacob hated Everard because lie wore golf
trousers and socks. Matthew, their father,
knew it, and to make things interesting
died of heart failure about two paces from
the footlights. Then Jacob and Simon and
their step-brother Everard became posses-
sors of Matthew’s property. But it came
to pass that Martha was about to take unto
herself another husband named John,
whereupon Simon, Jacob and Everard were
sore oppressed (the first two for financial
reasons and Everard because it afforded him
an opportunity to make a fine speech and
be applauded by the gods). So on the
night of the same day Simon and Jacob slew
their step-ma; and Everard, hearing the
shrieks, hastened to Martha’s chamber, and,
having laid hold of the knife with the
blood-stains fresh upon it, came out of the
room just as the whole police force, Simon
and Jacob and the rest of the town came
in. And he was condemned to die accord-
ingly. But Rose, who was to become Ever-
ard’s wife, made love to Simon and Jacob
and extracted a confession from Simon, even
as Jacob entered the room. Thereupon
Jacob fell upon his brother Simon with a
sledge hammer and would have smote him
mightily had not Simon also taken a sledge
hammer and fallen upon Jacob. Then there
followed a very well-rehearsed battle
between the two brothers, and behold Simon
was knocked out, whereupon Jacob slew
him with a mighty blow. And again the
village police force, Everard (who had
escaped from prison), and the rest of the
multitude came into sight. And on the
morrow Jacob got it in the neck. And,
finally, dear brethren, let me warn you that
“The Sledge Hammer,” from which my ser-
mon is derived, will be taken off to-morrow
night, and replaced on Saturday by “Under
Two Flags.” Amen.

Those merry and bright entertainers, Le
Roy, Talma and Bosco, will be at their trade
at Sydney Palace to-night and to-morrow
night. On Saturday those who desire to see
the show are hereby warned that it will not
be at the Palace, but at the Little Theatre.
On Monday, also, it will be at the Little
Theatre. On Tuesday it will be on its way
to Queensland, so the public had better get
a move on.
THE KNOCK-OUT IN THE SYDNEY
A DELPHI SLEDGE-HAMMER FIGHT.
“Within the Law” retires from Sydney
Criterion this week to make room for Muriel
Starr as “The Chorus Lady,” another im-
portation from the U.S.A., the land of
machine-made drama.
“The Girl in the Taxi” is continuing her
lengthy joy-ride at Her Majesty’s, Sydney.
The meter has registered immense prices
night by night, and the souls of the pro-
prietors of the J. C. Williamson garage are
filled with joy in consequence.
Sydney Royal will open a rather cob-
webby front door on Saturday night, when
Nellie Stewart starts a season of Belasco’s
“Du. Barry.”
Cinquevalli (pronounced by various people
Sank- Chink- or plain Sink- E. Vaney)
opened at the Sydney Tivoli on Saturday
night, and anything that The Bulletin says
about him would have as much effect
on his tremendous reputation as a pea-rifle
would have on a Dreadnought. Suffice there-
fore to mention that he is the same Clnnk-
Sank- or Sink- E. Valley as he always was.
The rest of the programme—which now
includes a ragtime Baroness and a first-class
burnt-cork comedian —is everything that a
Tivoli programme should be.
The big shriek at the National Amphi-
theatre (Sydney) this week is Henri French,
who can depict the joyous spirit of the happy-
go-lucky, intoxicated citizen better than the
intoxicated citizen can depict himself. Some
people resemble themselves, and some people
are better resembled by other people, which
is a large saying and calls for heaps of con-
sideration. In aid of French are Clement
May (who animates famous characters from
the books of Dickens), and Tiie Bulletin’s
awkward friends, the maniac bulldogs. As
bulldogs they are the goods, but as maniacs
they are disappointing. Their difficulty is
that they are unable to read the special war
editions of the daily newspapers.
The following message was received by
The Bulletin’s blood and battle sub-editor
when the censor was sharpening his axe in
“Hop’s” room: —
The Germans have been defeated once more. They
are now falling back on the Imperial Palace de Luxe.
For Imperial Palace de Luxe read Imperial
Salon de Luxe, and Sydney will understand
the message.
Adelaide Royal has been trying, per the
Anderson co., a new melodrama, “Her Luck
in London.” The talented author of “While
London Sleeps” knows just how to concoct
this kind of thing, and his story of the
girl who took a dubious Turning but got
back home all right, though it is not as good
as it might be, is much better than many
recent things of the kind. Anyway, it gives
a good chance to the virtuous Conway, and

the villainous Stanford, and the dubious
Olive Wilton, and they all rise to the occa-
sion. Beth Tate, a real little artist, is still
singing her quaint songs at the Tivoli, where
also are the graceful Pillions, the revolving
Omegas, and the bright, versatile Thornley
Dodge. Also De Dio of the spectacular effects
is just coming in. At the King’s, the long-
expected Josephine Gassmann and her imps
of darkness really have arrived at last, while
the Deaves marionette show continues as
before, and Brent Hayes still brings solid
melody from his banjo. The clever “pink”
Dandies —Ford Waltham, Brennan, the
Fitzgerald girls, etc. —are at the Town Hall.
Wondergraph has the tremendous Italian
film of “Nero,” acted regardless of expense
or of (apparent) bloodshed. It is proved
once more that one big story is the safest
draw in the kinema business. West’s special-
ises in an Asta Neilsen drama, and
all of them put up such warlike photos, as
are available. At the Pav. there is a differ-
ent kind of fight. Carpentier v. Smith did
not last very long in fact, but at the Pav.

The Covent Garden Ball, which was to
happen at Her Majesty’s (Melb.), on the
night of Friday, the 28th, has seemingly
been rolled away into the future. The
arrangements were made. As soon as the
audience had left the premises on the last
night of the Gilbert and Sullivan Opera
season (27th), 300 carpenters were to rush
in and build a dancing floor over the stalls
and pit, level with the stage. Also, a stair-
case was to be placed from the front stalls
to the d.c., to enable revellers to reach the
foyers and the refreshment buffets. All
this was to be carpentered in 12 hours, so
that the decorators might leap on to
the scene and make the auditorium
look lovely before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The price of dancing tickets was a
guinea, and lookers-on were to pay half a
guinea, or less, for seats in the d.c. and
amphitheatre. After the ball was over,
after the hop was done, all the temporary
fittings were to disappear in time for the
panto to be revived on Saturday night. But
the war came and blew out the Covent Gar-
den Ball scheme. Instead of the intended
feast of carpentry and flow of tango there are
to be two matinees at Her Majesty’s • on
the 28th, in aid of the Australian Patriotic
Fund —a morning performance, beginning
at 10.30 a.m., and an afternoon ditto, begin*
ning at 2.30 p.m. Two “all star” pro-
grammes will respectively be headed by the
State Governor and the Federal Excellency
who will deliver stirring harangues from tlie
stage. Prices will range from 10s. down-
wards. Moreover, each performance is to
have the charm of a lottery added to its
other attractions. The prize offered to
morning ticket purchasers is a £2O cheque,
presented by Mr. and Mrs. Harry Plimmer’
and jeweller Gaunt will donate a gold wrist
watch to be raffled among the after-lunch
audience.

MAJESTY'S.

“Pinafore" was staged for the last five
nights of the G. and S. season at Melbourne
Iler Majesty’s on Saturday. The show was
fairly strong in male chorus work, and the
amateur salts of the good old craft made full
and melodious use of every call that they
received to the quarter deck. The very tol-
erable warbling of the feminine support
also sweetened the business at rarer inter-
vals, but the principals were not tuned up
to a high pitch of efficiency. Chas.' Walenn.
as the official boss of the King’s Navee,
wasn’t especially droll or striking, and in
his vocal efforts he often employed his bari
tone to hide his meaning. Frank Wilson’s
Bill Bobstay and the; portly Kavanagh’s
Deadeye were unsensational creations, call-
ing neither for bricks nor laurel wreaths.
Ralph Rackstraw, as conceived by E
McKeown, was something like -an hidalgo
of the quarter-deck with one or two Julius
Napoleon attitudes and both eyes draped
in heavy mourning. He was tuneful, for
the most part, though in one wild attempt
to reach a high note he almost tore his tenor
out by the roots. G. Villiers Arnold, as
Captain Corcoran, was satisfactory through-
out. Miss Morrison, as Little Buttercup,
was a vision of rosy and rounded comeli-
ness; but Miss Lincoln- wasn’t always on
singing terms with the role of Josephine.
“Pinafore,” which is succeeded by the ser-
viceable “Trial by Jury,” is advertised to
conclude its innings to-night. On Saturday
next a brief revival of “The Forty Thieves
will precede the first appearance m this
city of “Gipsy Love.” The said appearance
is due on September 5. • ,
“The Glad Eye,” which has started its
Australian tour-de-farce at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, is one of those wild stage stories
of connubial infidelity that might as well
have been called “Off the Chain,” or Ihe
Loose Leg,” or “The Gay Deceivers ’ or any
other familiar phrase to the same effect.
It is the story, multiplied by two, of the
giddy husband who often gets away from
luxurious domesticity in the country to
spend a costly time with another gul in
town. There are two husbands and wives
in this case, and whereas the men are birds
of a feather the women are distinct types,
one being suspicious yet philosophical,
whilst the other is artless and _ emotional.
Also there is one silly old father-in-law who
plays with spiritualism and keeps a fraudu-
lent male “medium” on the premises, and a

private inquiry agent who masquerades as
a titled aeronaut until the real Count turns
up to straighten things out. The farce has
no mother-in-law, nor any moral, but every-
thing in the way of complication which can
be crammed within its limits of improba-
bility is neatly packed therein. Humorous
situations are dovetailed in “The Glad Eye,”
and from every nook and corner of the nar-
rative a ridiculous incident is extracted.
It differs from a hundred other English ver-
sions of French farce in being anglicised
only as regards the dialogue, and in being
supremely funny in its knock-about business,
lhe glimpses that the audience gets of a
tall, thin husband dealing violently with a
short, stocky husband behind a draoed balus-
trade are the most shriekful dumb-show
entertainment this paper can remember.
I lie knock-about fun may be crude in char-
acter, but the method of obtaining a human
l unch and Judy effect, with the gallery of a
chateau library for the stage, is a master-
piece of applied art.
* * * *
The company, mostly imported for the
purpose, keeps “The Glad Eye” bright
enough for nearly three hours. T. Shelford
and H. J. Ford do good character acting as
the two husbands, and their clever footwork
in their rowdiest scene is quite remarkable.
Miss Ethel Dana, as Iviki, the girl from
Paris, who is always mercenary and never
obtrusively improper like the ordinary
sprightlv demi-mondaine of cerulean comedy,
plays her part to the life. Miss Ham-
ilton and Miss Whittaker are a satisfactory
pair of overdressed young matrons. Frank
Bradley and Landor make good as the old
man and his “medium.” Vernon (the pro-
ducer of the piece) is extravagantly foolish
in hjs sinful designs upon Madame, whilst
R. Kenneth, Gilbert Emery and Shirley give
valuable assistance. Two stage sets —in-
teriors—are reminders of the Princess’s
palmiest days.
The peaceful comedy of “Bunty” con-
tinues to get along as well as could be
expected, or even more so, at Melbourne
King’s. After inhaling germs of war fever
and whiffs of battle smoke in the outside
world it is good to drop into the King’s and
breathe the atmosphere of a Scawtch Saw-
bath in the kirkyard at Lintiehaugh. In
the kirkyard one notices how the company
lias recovered its easy self-possession since
the first nicht in Melbourne. Weelum puts
a truer touch of simplicity into his perform-
ance, and the venom of Antie Soosie is more
quietly expressed. After listening to the
altercations _ in the kirkyard you feel that
Divine Service has done no real guid to any-
body except the collie dogs, who lay down
and dozed meanwhile.
At Melbourne Royal, where Napoleon and
Josephine will sigh and suffer until further
notice, the force of circumstances continues
to come to the management’s sup-

port. While the call to arms is ringing round
the Empire ( vide advt.) eager citizens flock
into the Royal to see how these British bull-
dogs fight on canvas, and hearts beat faster
with the hope that they will fight on as
victoriously as they are painted. The fact
that they have changed their enemies and
allies since Waterloo doesn’t really matter.
Florence Smithson, the new “star’
vocalist at Melbourne Tivoli, is unlucky in
coming so soon after Ada Reeve, who turned
her little bit of warble to good account in a
wide range of descriptive songs. Miss Smith-
son is a siiiger of much higher class, but her
well-trained voice is only a light Soprano,
and her descriptive method of delivering such
things as Tosti’s “Good-bye” has all the
affectation which the more finished actress
carefully avoided. In fact, affectations mar
the sweetness and grace of Miss Smithson’s
turn. Her gestures are few and studied,
and even her diction is somewhat artificial.
Tom Kelly is another recent arrival at the
Rickards Tivoli, but Thomas came due on
Monday, and judgment on that Irish
comedian is deferred for a week.

The contortions of Juno Salmo still dom-
inate the proceedings at Melbourne Bijou,
and Ed. Blondell continues to distend his act

ton Max, the ventriloquist, nor the Strattons

recent newcomers include Rellami, the
accordeonist, and the Casselli Sisters, who
are skilled leg-wavers from S’Africa.
The star film at Melbourne Majestic on
Saturday was “A Woman’s Triumph,” a
hasty but not uninteresting abridgment of
the Effie and Jeanie Deans drama, in Scott’s
“Heart of Midlothian.” The other drama
was a slab of morbid and heavy fiction called
“Living a Lie,” and the remaining features
embraced “A Rash Revenge,” “Sunny Jim
at the North Pole,” and a warlike item
showing the recruiting of Australians for the
war —if there is one.
From London: Eille Norwood, Australia’s
old friend, is scoring well as the husband in
a revival of Sardou’s “Scrap of Paper.”
Critics complain of the inconsistency which
puts the characters into crinolines and then
makes them say such up-to-date words as
“ripping” and “rotten.” The sudden death
of Carlotta Addison gave Nellie Mortyne a
chance in Shaw’s “Pygmalion,” but after a
week she was replaced by Alma Murray.
The Referee says frankly that Nellie was
admirable in the part, and was sacrificed to
the demand for well-known names. Among
the many utter failures of the season is an
interesting “old-time revue,” which showed
Kemble, Garrick, Mrs. Siddons, the infant
Roscius and others in bits from their most
famous parts. Among the big successes are
“Mr. Wu” (200-odd, and going strong) and
“The Great Adventure” (500). Stanley
Houghton, author of “Hindle Wakes,” is
to be commemorated in his native Man-
chester by—so the bishop at the head of the
Memorial Committee states —a scholarship
at the Grammar School, “to stimulate the
serious study of dramatic literature.” It
seems an odd subject to set schoolboys on to.
A canon conducted the memorial service for
Lawrence Irving and his wife, and the King

is K. L. Duffield, of Adelaide.
AT POVERTY POINT.
So Mrs. Charbonnet-Kellerman is dead.
Alice Charbonnet, as she was prior to her
marriage, was born in Cincinnatti (U.S.A.),
and after studying music in Paris went
with her father to New Caledonia, where he
held an official position. She was then aged
18. In May, 1878, she made her debut in
Sydney at the old Masonic Hall in York-
street, where she gave 14 concerts. After-
wards she toured Maoriland, then went to
Melbourne, where she remained until 1882.
She returned to Sydney, married and settled
there. In 1899 she sang farewell to Sydney
and went to Paris, where she was secretary
to the Alliance Franco-Britannique. Of
her children born in Sydney, Maurice is a
professional musician in America, and
Annette is the expert swimmer and physical
culturist, now showing in English music-
halls.
“Harrison O.” : The present writer for one
—no doubt there are others —is not inclined
to accept Francis Cellier’s statement in his
reminiscences (mentioned B. 13/8/T4) that
“Ruddigore” was financially the most suc-
cessful of the Savoy operas. “Ruddigore”
was put on in the Fog in 1887, and quickly
succeeded by “The Yeomen of the Guard.”
It was never revived. When on the opening
night one of the ghosts spoke the line, “Fal-
lacy somewhere,” the reply of a gallery
critic: “You’re right, there is,” was received
with approval, for it was the general opinion
that the opera was distinctly below Savoy
standard. B. W. Findon (a relative of Sulli-
van’s, who was on intimate terms with the
composer) says of “Ruddigore” in his book,
“Sullivan and His Operas” : “It was the least
successful of the series.”
The “profesli” throughout the world is
invited to subscribe to a memorial to Laur-
ence and Mabel Irving, who were lost with
the Empress of Ireland. The provisional
committee asks that subscriptions from Aus-
tralasia be sent to hon. treasurer Dennis
Eadie, Royalty Theatre, Dean-street, W.
London. In a private note Tiie Bulletin
is assured that the memorial will not take
the form of a statue. For that much the
paper’s blessing is on the scheme.
“Mascotte”: “Melb’s” statement (B.
18/8/T4) that “The Mikado” opened the
existing Melbourne Princess’s Theatre, in
1885, is incorrect, as that house started
business in December, 188 G. The first per-
formance of “The Mikado” was at the
Royal in February of the same year. As
to McKeown being the best tenor we have
heard in Gilbert and Sullivan, that’s a stag-
gering opinion from one who has written
of Beaumont a few lines earlier. Beau-
mont in the ’Bo’s at that! I question much
if the present tenor could grapple for a fort-
night with the arduous part of Arnold in
“William Tell,” as Beaumont did, and finish
fresh for some of the easy Sullivan melodies.
Then, what about Charles Harding for a
voice? Certainly, these two had no oppor-
tunity of playing a round of Gilbert and
Sullivan parts, but of those who did I put
my hand on the heads of Bracy and Ken-
ningham.
Gallito, the boss toreador of Spain, who
had done more than any other cattle-sticker
to brighten the faded glories of the bull-ring,
met his fate last month. The bull tossed
him twice, and he came down the second
time with a ripped chest. Domestic dis-
turbances had queered his nerve, no doubt.
Not long ago he married a prima donna of
Madrid, and a little later he got a divorce
from the lady. Probably his Carmen
snapped her castanets at him and hoped
the bull would beat him next time, which
would be an unpleasant incident to remem-
ber when he started out to murder the fiery
beast in the arena. Anyhow the bull won
and Gallito was buried.
“Coot” : An account in this month’s num-
ber of The Strand magazine of the “pro-
perty” horse, which, when bounding across
the chasm with the fleeing heroine on its
back, stuck half-way, its mechanical legs
working furiously backwards and forwards
as it pawed the atmosphere, reminded me
of an incident at the Melbourne Royal when
George Rignold was playing Henry V. Rig-
nold used to appear on the stage on a fine,
upstanding, live, white war steed, which
nightly created uncensored applause. One
evening, however, the noble horse declined to
show more than its head, and not all the
efforts of the King’s men-at-arms and pur-
suivants and attendant nobility could per-
suade it to advance. The language of the
monarch was, as those who knew Rignold
can understand, quite unhallowed, but it
spread a great joy amongst the audience.
The same night one of the massive cannon,
used (for the first time) at the Battle of
Agincourt, bumped up against some of the
scenery, with the result that the heavy piece
of artillery toppled over, with a sound like a
watermelon falling. It was a great night
for the weary.
“Melb”: The best things in “A Royal
Divorce” have never been witnessed in
London. These are the tableaux of “The
Retreat from Moscow” and “Waterloo.”
When the piece was first in rehearsal in
Australia, Williamson said to scenic artist
George Gordon, “Don’t you think it wants
lifting somehow to secure good curtains?”
Gordon: “Certainly,” and he devised the
tableaux. Gordon had a large share in
designing the Melbourne Princess’s, with the
eminent architect Pitt. Gordon said:
“Hitherto Australian architects seem to have
rejoiced in giving half of the audience only
half a view of the stage. Let us secure a
full one for everybody.” And they did. He
was second to no London scenic artist.
When the Bancrofts produced “The Mer-
chant of Venice” at the tiny Prince of
Wales’s Theatre, formerly known as the
Dusthole, Tottenham Court-road, they sent
Gordon to Venice to glean inspiration for
the scenery, even as, in after time, Irving
and Hawes Craven went to Nuremberg to
get inspiration for “Faust.”
“John P.”: A novel moving picture was
made in Maori]and the other day. It is
based upon the legend of the beautiful Maori
maiden Hinemoa, who is alleged to have
swum many miles across Lake Rotorua to
her marooned lover, Tutanekai. This Maori
Romeo and Juliet business was acted by a
troop of Maoris at Rotorua on the actual
ground where the legend says the original
performance took place. G. A. Tarr, an ex-
perienced theatrical man, staged the show,
and, of course, made the most of Lake
Rotorua and all the geysers, boiling lakes
and mud ponds at Whakarewarewa. Brown
men and maidens proved to be fairly good
subjects for flickergraph work. The picture,
which runs to 2500 ft., has turned out a very
fine piece of animated photography, and
should prove a world-wide advt. for Maori-
land.
From London : G. R. Sims has been recal-
ling a few of the horrors he has stumbled on
in his 40 years of dramatic authorship. One
was the tragedy of Arthur Dacre and Amy
Roselle. Dacre and his wife took with them
to Australia a play of Sims’s, “A Wife’s
Ordeal.” Five weeks after news of the
tragedy reached London by cable Sims re-
ceived a letter with the Sydney postmark.
It contained a bank draft for author’s fees.
Dacre must have posted it last thing before
ringing the curtain down. William Terriss
played the hero in most of Sims’s plays at
the Adelphi. He was murdered at the stage
door by an actor named Prince, who had
previously played a similar part on the stage
in one of Sims’s plays. Sims has another
sort of collection of “In the Ranks.” An
actor-manager named Vernon was negotiat-
ing to take it on tour, when Sims received
this telegram: “Sorry cannot complete
arrangements for tour. Have unexpectedly
succeeded to a peerage.” That ex-actor-
manager is still sitting in the House of Peers
as Lord Lyneden.
A fine old N. S. Wales citizen passed out
last week in the person' of Normand Mac-
laurin, doctor, knight and chancellor of the
Sydney University. He stood for most of
the things which this paper abhors —
Foreign-trade, the State Rights gospel and
vehement Toryism amongst them—but his
political honesty was as transparent as
THE LATE NORMAND MACLAURIN.
his commercial and social probity, and he
was the kindliest and most courteous
of opponents. He was born and edu-
cated in Scotland, put in 13 years as a
naval doctor, and at the age of 37 began
practice in Sydney. He married Miss
Nathan, daughter of the big surgeon of that-
name, and leaves five sons, who are doctors,
barristers, soldiers and so on. He held all
sorts of important billets in his time, from
the Vice-Presidency of the Legislative Coun-
cil to the Presidency of the Bank of N S
Wales, and held his end up in all things as
a capable, strenuous Scot should. He was
a Unificationist of sorts —about the only
respect in which his views on a political
question jumped with those of The
Bulletin.

PRACTICAL PRESCRIPTION AGAINST
STOMACH ACIDITY.
BY A SPECIALIST.
“Nine-tenths of all cases _of stomach
trouble nowadays,” says a leading specialist,
“are caused by too much acid. In the begin-
ning the stomach itself is not diseased, but ir
this acid condition is allowed to continue the
acid is very likely to eat into the stomach
walls and produce stomach ulcer or cancel,
either of which may render a radical suigical
operation necessary, even to prolong me.
Therefore an ‘acid stomach’ is really a dan-
gerous condition, and should be treated seri-
ously. It is utterly useless to take pepsin
and ordinary stomach tablets. The _ excess
acid must be neutralised by the administiac-
tion of an efficient antacid. For this pui-
pose physicians nearly always recommenc
taking half a teaspoonful of bisurated mag-
nesia in a little water after each meal.
Larger quantities may be used it necessaiy,
as it is absolutely harmless. But be sure to
get the bisurated magnesia, as other forms
of magnesia have not the same action in tie
stomach as the bisurated, and frequently UO
more harm than good.”*
SOCIETY
Something more should be heard of the
grievance of Helen Davis, a Melbourne pen-
woman who was knocked down, whilst cross-
ing the road to catch a tramcar, by the
motor of a local medico. The victim, having
received injuries to the head, looked for
reasonable compensation from the doc. He
gave medical attention to his own particular
accident case and paid nursing exes, but
finally he repudiated all responsibility for
her injuries, on the ground that she was
not capable of taking proper care of herself
when the motor hit her. But he didn t
venture to put this in his defence when the
indignant penwoman brought her action for
compensation against him. She could pro-
duce no eye-witness of her accident, whereas
the doc. had the occupants of the car on his
side. The learned judge sided with the doc.,
and now the crushed plaintiff is making
what seems like a hopeless endeavor to
bring the question which affects her char-
acter under the notice of the Attorney-Gen-
eral and get it tried in another court. For
the doc. did, under cross-examination, admit
that he made the charge which she is
anxious to disprove.
“0.K.”: There has been always too .much
sword-and-scabbardashery about the Her-
man press, the posturing Kaiser and the
swanking Teutonic armies. Take a recent
article in the Berlin Lokal Anzeiger:—
When the German sword again slides into its scab-
bard everything we hope and wish will be consum-
mated. We will stand before the world as its
mightiest nation, which then, at last, will be in a
position, with its moderation and forbearance, to give
to the world peace, enlightenment and prosperity.
The sword is a ridiculous implement of
modern warfare in comparison with even
the bayonet, which German troops are said
to fight shy of. On the rare occasions when
cavalry get fairly within striking distance
of infantry nobody can do with a sword
what he couldn’t have better done with a
battle-axe in the stirring times when Philip
Augustus or Manuel Comnenus sat on his
horse. Moreover the comparison still holds
good. If a mounted soldier can find foes
near enough for him to smite at let it be
with a handy battle-axe or a 3ft. spike.
Then the popular German jingo figure of
speech would pass out of print. It is a rotten
old mischievious gag, adopted by military
officialdom (which alone carries the dangling
weapon that fools, fight duels with) for war-
like speech and inflammatory press purposes.
An official “surrendering his sword,” or
waving it, is a play-actor, like Captain Massa-
kroff in “The Chocolate Soldier.” To h —l
with all sword-and-scabbardashery !

Downside College, near Bath, West of Eng-
land, has been celebrating its centenary. It
helped to mould Australia’s first vicar-
general, Dr. Ullathorne; also Sydney’s first
Catholic boss prelate, Archbishop Polding.
Dr. Davis, first Bishop of Maitland (who
never lived in Maitland), likewise came from
Downside. Dr. Polding kept him in Sydney
as a sort of irregular coadjutor. Dr. Vaughan,
second Archbishop of Sydney, completes the
quartette of eminent members of the Benedic-
tine Order educated at Downside and
despatched to Australia. Curious that with
such a good start the Benedictines should
have failed to take root in Sydney. A con-
vent of Benedictine nuns and St. Benedict’s
Church in George-street are about all that
remain tot remind present-day Sydneyites of
the pioneer religious order in the Common-
wealth. The failure was due to racial antip-
athies between Irish and English Catholics
(the former being a big majority), and to the
bad tactics of Archbishop Polding. His con-
version of St. Mary’s into a monastic chapel
and his attempt to work the whole of Syd-
ney from this centre on Benedictine lines,
were obviously foredoomed to failure. On
appeal to Rome, Pope Pius IX. decided
against Polding, who wanted to resign, but
was persuaded to stay on. While the Eng-
lish Benedictines have died out in Eastern
Australia the Spanish Benedictines have in-
creased and flourished in the West. New
Norcia is a remarkable monastic township
and aboriginal mission station. A recently-
published life of Sir Frederick Weld, Gover-
nor of Westralia and Tasmania, contains a
very good description of it in the form of a
despatch to Lord Carnarvon. ex-Secretary of
State for the Colonies.
AN INVIDIOUS METAPHOR
DANCING YOUTH (who is “spelling” to wallflower): “I'd ask you to dance, you know ,
only there realty isn't room to swing a cat.”
A TRIFLE MIXED.
INEBKIATED GUEST: “Shay, o[?] fier, who’s that foot makin’ such a (h.c) dain' ass of
Imself n your right.”
N.S.W. law made rather an ass of itself
t’other day over an Adelaide youth who had
left a girl in Broken Hill. Its long arm
easily hauled him before an Adelaide police-
court, where he admitted responsibility for
the recent infant, and said he had a good local
billet and would pay whatever was demanded.
Ilis lawyer suggested £5 for preliminary
expenses, as being the S.A. tariff, and thought
the £2O Broken Hill demanded “must be tor
triplets” ; but the young father was quite
amiable, and offered £lO cash and the rest
to follow. The Hill, being technically in
another State, had to be consulted by tele-
gram, and proved inexorable. So he was
“remanded to Broken Hill” ; which means
that he was dragged out of his good billet
and reduced to earning nothing, so as _to
ensure lus paying a lot. The Adelaide
Police Magistrate would have accepted the
cash offer —this is where the foolishness
comes in—but the footling State-boundary
prevented him having a voice in the matter.
“0.K.”: Miss Emily Vaughan Jenkins,
one of the science picnickers from Britain,
makes a few rude remarks concerning Aus-
tralian “flappers,” and offers a suggestion
for dealing with their Happiness:—
In the life of a great city there is no healthy out-
look. One is not surprised to find the flapper type
in a place like London, but it is deplorable to see so
many first cousins to the London flapper among the
girlhood of this country. I consider your flapper a
menace to the community. Possibly the only way of
arousing her moral sensibility would be on the
broad educational lines of sex hygiene, by which
she might come to realise the sacredness of her
womanhood and awaken to a sense of self-reverence
and -respect.
All the same, Emily Jenkins is in favor of
the suffrage for women, including flappers
who have reached the age of 21.
“Rule Nisi”: Justice Powers, sitting at
Sydney on August 19 iu the Federal Arbi-
tration Court, gave an important ruling in
a case brought by the Engine Drivers’ Asso-
ciation against J. and A. Brown, the coal
peers of Newcastle. If there is any chance
of going to law about anything you can
trust John Brown to find it out. The
engine drivers’ award rate is 12s. a day,
calculated at Is. 6d. per hour for eight
hours. The defendant firm argued that this
gave them the right to employ a man by
the hour, and to pay him Is. (id., 35., 4s. Gd.,
65., up to 12s. a day, according to the num-
ber of hours Worked. The plaintiff asso-
ciation maintained that if a man was
employed for one hour on one day he was
entitled to a day’s pay, and Justice Powers
upheld that contention. Clearly any other
ruling would mean chaos to all industrial
unions. To get his 12s. a man would have
to be assured of eight hours’ work every
morning he started business, _ and would
never know when a cheeseparing foreman
would order him to knock off. The system,
extended to other branches of labor, would
really mean piecework, with hours as units,
a system certainly not provided for in exist-
ing industrial legislation.

Curious nowadays to recall that, at the
time of the Crimea, the bandsmen of each
British regiment attended in their own rough
fashion to the field ambulance work. Before
going into action at the battle of‘the Alma,
Campbell, in command of the Highlanders,
warned his men not to bother about their
wounded comrades during the heat of the
action, threatening that, if any man did so,
“his name shall be stuck up in his parish
church.” The Turks, during the recent per-
formance in the Balkans, were just as badly
off, for they possessed no ambulances or
stretcher-bearers; so, whenever a man was
wounded, two or more other soldiers woulu
knock off fighting in order to help him over
the long, groaning miles to Chorlu. And
most of the helpers weren’t sufficiently inter-
ested in the disturbance to come back and
see it out. As the Bulgarian shrapnel
merely wounded an extraordinarily large
number of Turks, it was really more effec-
tive in a fighting sense than if the unlucky
ones had been outed altogether. _ An old-
time commander of Campbell’s calibre. might
have saved the situation by threatening all
volunteer first-aiders with a severe washing
i'n the Bosphorus.

The gem sentence in Kitchener’s 200 wonls
of advice to the British Tommy is: Be
courteous to women, but not nrnre than cour-
teous.” It suggests a new wheeze for sogers
on inactive service in towns abroad,, and at
home: “Now, then, Chorley, you’re a-gittin
too Icorchous /” It is a paradoxical warning
which disturbs the respectful lover in his
most poetic mood. The tenderest courtesy to
women is perceived, on reflection, to _> e
inspired by man’s desire to be extremely

THE STRATEGIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If every man will do what little he can in his
own line of industry, instead of drawing diagrams in
beer on the bar-counter of a pub, showing the posi-
tion of the Belgian army, he will be a better patriot.
—Bullutin (20/8/’l4).
He drew a diagram in beer
Upon the private bar,
And set his pot down saying, “Here
Is where the Belgians are ;
They are 'the fellows with the guns:
They’re there —just where this beer-stain runs.”
He took a piece of soapy cheese
And two stale gingerbreads,
And set them down, and said, “Now, these
Are Germans —see their heads
They’re rolling up the Belgian rear. . . .
Thanks ! ’Ere, Miss ! Mine’s another beer ! ”
He grabbed his pot and set it back
Where Belgium’s army lay ;
Then drew a nail along a crack
And said, “The Frenchies stay
Along this line —they’re mountings, mind ;
The Germans must come up behind.”
And then he seized my whisky quick,
Before I could prevent,
And slammed it down like some old brick
And said, “That’s Mons and Ghent ;
My word, the fights round Liege were small
To what we’ll see when them towns fall!”
I took my glass back —half was spilt—
And swiftly drank my drink ;
He seized a knife below the hilt;
I saw the free lunch shrink ;
He cut a large, thick slice of meat
And said, “That’s ’ow the Belgians beat!
“Now, / oiler me ; this bread-crust, there,
Marks where our blokes ’ll be;
Them German sossidges won’t dare
To face ’em on the sea;
This celery will do to show
The British Fleet on sentry-go.”
He laid a strong and ancient pipe
Beside my empty glass;
“Let that,” he said, “stand for the type
Of croosers wot can’t pass
The shallers of the Skagyer Back
To ’unt them blanky Germans back!
“Yes —Dreadnoughts; that’s right, Mister;
thanks ;
I don’t mind if I do.
I know most of the leadin’ ranks,
And ships Well, ’ere’s to you!
I’m sorry for them Germans, now ;
That Kiser, ’e’s a’ awful cow !
Wot chance ’as ’e wif blokes like us?
It’s blood wot alwis tells!
Wot lager-drinkin’ Deutscher cuss
’As got a ’ope? They yells
About a Dutchman over all,
But ’Umpty-Dumpty ’ad a fall.”
He bit the Belgian army hard
And chewed it to a pulp,
And swallowed it, with slow regard,
At one colossal gulp ;
And then he tore the British Fleet
In pieces ; crumbs dropped round his feet.

DISORDERS OF THE MIDDLE-AGED MAR.
After the age of fifty even the most healthy
of men find it necessary to make some changes
in their of life. They can no longer
eat and drink whatever fancy dictates, and
they require regular hours of rest and sleep.
Some little weakness begins to develop. It
may be dyspepsia in one of its multifarious
forms ; gout, or some uric acid disorder ; or,
worst of all, a nervous breakdown. What-
ever form the disorder assumes, it comes so
gradually that it is oftentimes well advanced
before the busy man realises its significance.
In all modern works on medicine, one fact
is made abundantly clear —that nearly all
disorders of this kind have their origin in the
digestive area. It is too wide a subject to
discuss here, but broadly speaking, we poison
ourselves by absorption from the intestinal
tract. It follows that if the digestive organs
could be kept in a healthy condition to
perform their functions naturally, many of
the worst disorders of middle age might be
avoided. The seat of the m"st serious of
these disorders lies in the intestines, and
therefore ordinary digestive remedies are of
no avail because they do not reach the
intestines at all. The most useful, all-round
remedy in these intestinal cases is petroleum,
because, unlike animal oil, it passes through
the stomach unchanged, and exercises its
soothing, lubricating disinfectant action
directly upon the intestines.
The original and standard pr.paration of
petroleum for internal use is Ang.er’s Emul-
sion. In this preparation the petroleum is
purified by a special process, and combined
with hypophosphites in the form of a perfect
emulsion that is pleasant to the palate and
acceptable to the most delicate stomach.
Apart from its soothing, healing properties,
Angier’s Emulsion exerts a marked tonic,
invigorating influence, which makes it of value
in a wide variety of disorders. Of all chemists

Dear Bulletin, — I don’t see why the daily
paper tacticians should have this war all
to themselves. Their job is a simple one,
which any writer who ' possesses nerve,
imagination and the capacity to study the
cables can undertake. Considering the facts
that there are no war-correspondents at the
front; that the message of to-day (assum-
ing it is in any way stirring) is usually con-
tradicted by the cable of to-morrow; that
most of our local experts have never been
to Europe or had anything to do with war-
fare ; and that in any case no one in
authority has time to supply contradic-
tions —considering all these things, I say,
the following appears to me to be a very
satisfactory collection of information :
IN THE FIRING-LINE.
Our Warsaw correspondent cables that, the 17th
day having now arrived the Russian mobilisation is
complete, and a force variously estimated at from
three to seven million men is concentrating on the
German frontier, near Breslau. As we predicted
in a previous issue, the Germans in the affected
area are becoming considerably perturbed. This
is not intended as a reflection on the courage of
the enemy. The prevailing disquietude is a matter
of the food supply. As von der Golz pithily put
it in his standard work “Blutwurst am Mainz,”
‘‘thirty or forty army corps take a bit of feeding.”
One of the things which contribute to make the
Russian unpopular as an invader is his habit of
feeding as he goes along. Kraut has well termed
him (see “Lieber-bier,” vol. IV.) “the goat of
Europe.” He can eat anything. At the present
moment he is probably doing himself well on the
boots, saddles, etc., which are among the staple
manufactures of the towns in Eastern Prussia.
The extraordinary speed with which the nominally
gradual Northerners have travelled has baffled mili-
tary experts in countless trams, bars and ferry-boats.
The writer cleared up this mystery at lunch yester-
day, and all present, including the waitress, ad-
mitted that it was a new one on them. The fact
is, as we predicted from the first, the immense turn-
ing movement, whose ultimate object is to round up
the inhabitants of Eastern Germany and drive them
via Austria-Hungary into the Adriatic, has been
entrusted to Prince . Issilvitch. A consummate psy-
chologist, he has long been famous for heartening
his men by means of harmless little ruses. A map
was designed by him,'some time ago, for the purposes
of the present war, and distributed to every man
in the Russian Army. It shows the southern half of
Europe, with the Mediterranean, Black Sea, Adriatic
and so on qorrectly enough, but in the place where
the TEgean appears on non-military maps, this
subtle tactician has 1 inscribed “Sea of Vodka.” The
soldiers are thus convinced that they are marching
THE ALCOHOLIC PRESENCE
OF HIND.
BOOZER ( indignantly, to old lady he
has cannoned over): “ Well, and
wadyathinkcryershelf?”
in the direction of the source of their national
beverage. What wonder that their step is light and
their advance rapid?
According to a Paris message, “30 French soldiers
are preparing to repel the Germans in Bel-
gium.” This is indeed news. It means that an
exceptionally powerful Gallic force is ready, or will
shortly be ready, to engage the insolent invader on
Belgian territory.
I can dash off this sort of thing with the
utmost readiness, so if there is any market
for it let me know, and I will weigh in with
as much as you are able to stand, week by
week. —Yours, etc., Hannibal Smith.
INNOCENCE.
SHE: “Say, what do men mean when they whistle at what is said?"
HE: “Oh, well—er —it sometimes means that the conversation is rather warm. Why?"
SHE: “I was merely telling uncle some of your funny stories, and several times he
suddenly whistled."
A modest little demand for £6OOO as
damages for slander is causing a flutter in
Maoriland. It is being handed out by a
Hr. McEldowney, of Fogland, to a lady named
Martha Buttimore, of Gisborne (M.L.). It
is alleged that on or about April 5, 1909, the
lady falsely and maliciously made a state-
ment concerning him to one Gibson, of Gis-
borne, and that as the result of this state-
ment Gibson was induced to alter his will
(which up till that time contained a provi-
sion bequeathing property worth £6OOO to
McEldowney). Gibson passed over recently
and the fact was then discovered that Me.
had been cut out. So he wants damages to
the extent of the amount he has missed. The
lady is now trying to remember what it was
she said over five years ago. and an army of
lawyers are licking their chops in anticipa-
tion.
The most gallant achievement of the war-
like larrikins of Melbourne up to date has
been the firing of bullets through the plate-
glass window of a Collingwood wine-shop,
kept by a Swiss. It is not quite clear
whether the besiegers mistook the unfortu-
nate citizen for a German, or were under
the impression that Britain and Switzer-
land are at war. In the Boer war days an
enthusiastic Sydney softgoods man dis-
charged a Peruvian clerk on suspicion of
being born in Amsterdam. Thus does
patriotism break out in unexpected places.
Our motor casualties look paltry by com-
parison with Europe’s war-casualties, and
yet the. former are so persistent as to call
for notice. Take last week. On one day
in Melbourne a motor-car overturned at a
corner, damaging four occupants. Another
crashed into a post at Brighton Beach, with
two casualties. Another swept along the
side of a tram dummy, injuring eight indivi-
duals. Another raced a train over a level
crossing and met in the middle—one dead,
one injured. And two motor-bikes met head-
on in the M.C. Club’s 25-mile road race
near Wallan. This race was 12J miles out
and home, and one bikist had made the turn
and got up speed for home when, in a cloud
of dust, he ran into another coming out.
As both were doing over 60 miles an hour,
the individual rate of impact was about 125
miles an hour, and when they came to a
nnal stop they were 150 ft. apart, and as
dead-looking as mutton. Why can’t the
motorist hasten a trifle more gradually?

Nick”: Apropos of Billy Blue (B.
13/8/T4) and his Sydney harbor ferry, how
many people know that Lavender Bay also
derives its name from a member of the old
North Shore ferryman’s family? The bay
was originally known as Hulk Bay, and was
so called, up to the latter ’6o’s, because the
old convict prison hulk Phoenix was moored
there during the ’3o’s and ’4o’s. The super-
intendent of the Phoenix was one Thomas
Mackey, and the boatswain was George Lav-
ender. This latter married Billy Blue’s
daughter Susannah, and when' the old ferry-
man died he left his daughter portion
of his 80 acres at the head of the
bay. There Lavender built a house,
and, when the hulk was done away
with, Hulk Bay was changed to Lavender
Bay. After Lavender’s death his widow
married William Cliuter, who built and kept
the Billy Blue Inn. On the death of Mrs.
Chuter the property was sold and passed out
of the family.

“Three Cheers”: There seem to be vari-
ous sorts of patriotism. I used to live in
and stumble over the Sydney suburb of
Mosman, where the council is paid heavily
by the ratepayers for neglecting the roads.
At the end of every goat-track and cow-
wallow are ratepayers who groan in chorus
and look forward to the glad time when there
will be something like a civilised way to
their red-roofed homes. They don’t go out
with guns and destroy the local council;
they just pay their rates and groan and
hope. But the revolution nearly arrived
when war broke out and the council stuck
out its proud chest and got itself on the
patriotic honor-roll by announcing that it
would help the Empire by keeping some of
the roads in order! To earn the same sort
of Hooray I’ve decided to help my country
by cleaning my boots. (P.S. —The wife ha’s
given me the money for the polish 18 times,
but up to now I’ve been spending it on “sun-
dries” —the same as this precious council.)
The present war is a chance for the young
professional military officers Australia has
been training at Duntroon (close to Can-
berra), as Kitchener advised. It comes a
bit soon, the first lot who joined the college
being now in their fourth (and final) year;
but the whole of these have been given the
rank of lieutenant and dispersed to help in
organising the forces. As they have been
studying nothing but war since 1911 they
ought to be useful. There are over 30 from
the different States, and another dozen from
Maoriland —which wisely arranged to feder-
ate for this particular job, instead of going
to all the expense of a similar training col-
lege for itself. And as many more will be
turned out, skilled in all the science of war-
fare —theoretically—each year. It was
intended that each should have a year with
a British regiment, to put a final polish on ;
but this first batch may get a glimpse of real
war instead.

The fact of a drought is definitely recog-
nised in South Australia at last. Even
Adelaide’s splendid double-barrelled water
system is under suspicion. If there comes
no more rain—and July, the usually wet
month, is over without result—water will
give out next January, just when most
needed. So last week the edict went forth
that for the present gardens must go with-
out. And Adelaide is a city of gardens.

Rome was then a very unhealthy city.
Adelaide’s veteran R.C. Archbishop
O’Reily is unable, from failing health, to
carry out all the duties of his office, and has
been given a “coadjutor,” R. M. Spence, of
North Adelaide (and Cork). Prelates from
all over Australia attended the ceremony.
South Australia has a smaller proportion

he married last year is of the Old Roman

BICE , Chief Secretary (S.A.).
The wife of Richard Teece, general man-
ager A.M.P. Society, died at her home,
Turramurra (N.S.W.), last week, aged • >!)
years. She was a daughter of Alderman
Benjamin Primer, who was Mayor of Sydney
in 1875-76. In the first ’so’s be kept The Swan
With Two Necks, on the corner of Park and
George streets, and later the Liverpool Arms,
on the S.W. corner of Pitt and King streets.
There, in 1855, he issued a token which
passed current for one penny. It is difficult
to write up these old identities without a
public-house creeping in somewhere.
Royal families breed queer dissensions in
patriotism. Two sons of his late Serene
Highness Prince Teek (brothers of Queen
Mary) have gone to fight against the
country their gay old dad came from.
Of the last 12 royal persons who were
made Knights of the Garter seven wore
murdered—according to a London journalist
who inquires into such matters. Vacancies
in the “Garter” order are very occasional,
and it took 32 years for the dozen of kings
and princes to be duly installed, the late
Archduke of Austria being the twelfth. The
previous six who came to a violent end had
gone to prove that royalty is an unhealthy
business, but their deaths didn’t lead to all
round disturbances among the nations. The
late Archduke K. G. will shine in
history as the gay spark who unconsciously
caused the biggest explosion of gunpowder
this world has known.
HOCH!
The man who set fire to his own house.
Randolph Bedford writes :
The deceased Gregor McGregor was one of the
best men Australia ever called across the sea. Every-
thing outside of himself seemed against him. Yet he
won through, as much by his qualities of heart as
by the prodigious memory, which is the father of
genius. He was a bricklayer’s laborer when blindness
found him 30 years ago. As scon as darkness came
he took his belt up a hole and went to new work in
new conditions. He went into State politics,
and was a Senator at the beginning of the
Commonwealth in the Year One. He beat
his blindness with his memory and the help
of his wife and children, who read the
politics of the day two or three times until he
memorised them, and that heeled him for his opponents.
As Vice-President of the Executive Council he led
the Senate, carrying Government Bills through, rebut-
ting often Quilpish opposition decisively and suavely.
A kindly, honest, humorous, thorough, patient gentle-
man was Gregor McGregor, and one of the best men
Labor politics gave to Australia. It takes but one
McGregor in a party to balance the foolishness of
many undesirables like O’Malley and Meagher. And
how does this steadfast blind laborer compare with
Joe Cook, the ex-republican, ex-Protectionist, ex-land
taxer; with Willie Kelly, the terrible, example of a
little man who didn't have to work for a living; and
Bruce Smith, the portentous futility of the Addi-
sonian phraseology and the political opinions of 34
b.C. ?
The doyen of the Australian Civil Ser-
vice, J. J. Calvert, Clerk of the Parlia-
ments and Clerk of the Legislative Council
of New South Wales, will celebrate his
84th birthday this month, lie joined the
N.S.W. Service in 1853, and transferred his
services to the Parliaments on the inaugura-
tion of Responsible Government in ISSG,
when he was Clerk of Committees of the
Assembly, lie became First Clerk of the
Council in 1850, Clerk Assistant in 1860, and
Clerk of the Parliaments in 1871. He has
seen something like 400 Legislative Coun-
cillors sworn in, and about 350 pass out.
If he has luck he’ll see the other 50 go. lie
talks of resigning presently. At the Suttor
dinner recently he mentioned the fact that
he had served under all the presidents,
Alfred Stephen, J. 11. Plunkett, W. W. Bur-
ton. W. C. Wentworth, T. A. Murray. John
Hay, John Lackey and F. B. Suttor. and
that he is the sole survivor of the members
and officials of the first Parliament under
Responsible Government. He was a guest
of Henry Parkes at a dinner of 12 surviving
members of the First Parliament, on May
23. 1887. There were 21 of the members
then living. Three were in Fngland, one in
Queensland and 17 in N.S.W. All are now
dead, and their address is unknown. Calvert
lias put up another record. He has been
president of the Rugby Union of N.S.W.
. fi r 40 years.
“Chasuble”
Leo. XIII. was an aristocratic statesman, Pius a
simple democratic priest. He took more forward
action than ever Leo did, but probably none of it
will endure. His tulminations on church music are
already a dead letter ; those on.marriage and modern-
ism will become to. Glancing' back to the election,
we find Rampolla with every light to the Papacy,
humanly speaking'. As Leo's Prime Minister he had
virtually been Pope for long. The tipsters, all over
the world, put him first on their lists. Yet the
Cardinal-Archbishop of Cracow attended the Con-
clave with a fulmination in his pocket from the
Austrian Emperor. This was, in essence: “If Ram-
polla is on the point of being elected, step in with
my prohibition.'' He was the Conservative candidate.
The Liberals had two, Gotti and Vanuutelli, the latter
a superb figure, who afterwards led the Eucharistic
Congresses in London and Montreal. Probably he will
consider himself too old for the Sydney Eucharistic
Congress next year. 1 n the Papacy struggle he
quickly yielded to Gotti. However, the Rampolla
men were unmistakably ahead, and progressing to
the necessary two-thirds, when Cracow inteivened.
Rampolla made a bitter speech. His supporters swung
over to the unthought-of Sarto," and the Gottites
yielded. The new Pope did wisely by making the
comparatively young Spaniard,' Del_ Val, a Cardinal
and his Prime Minister. It can easily-be gauged in
what acts Pius X. overbore this sensible diplomatist.
The Pope must be Italian, so Del \al is out of the
running.
At a dinner given to Francis Bathurst
Suttor, President of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales, to cele-
brate the 75th anniversary of his
birth, that gentleman gave some inter-
esting family particulars, Parliamentary
and otherwise. His grandfather, George
Suttor, was a protege of Joseph Banks,
the godfather of Australia. He settled
at Baulkliam Hills, and was loyal
to Governor Bligli, for which “offence” he
suffered six months’ imprisonment in the
smellful hole known' as the Sydney gaol in
Lower George-street. He had his revenge,
however, when he gave evidence at the
court-martial on Lieutenant-Colonel John-
ston. He had five sons and four daughters.
Two of the sons, John Bligh and William
Henry, entered political life. The latter
was one of the first members elected by the
people to the first —or mixed—House in
1843, and sat, also, in the first six Parlia-
ments under Responsible Government. John
Bligh Suttor, who was a younger brother,
was in the sixth and seventh Parliaments.
William Henry Suttor, jun., was in the
eighth and ninth Parliaments and for
many years in the Legislative Council. John
Bligli Suttor was also in the Council for five
years. Francis Bathurst Suttor himself has
the longest Parliamentary record of the
family. He made 17 appeals to the free and
independent, and was successful in 12, and
lie held office under four different Premiers,
lie is the son of William Henry, the third
son of George Suttor, who married Charlotte
Augusta Anne Francis. They had 12 chil-
dren, 11 of whom still live. All are married,
all have children, and all, save one, grand-
children. There are 70 children and 57
grandchildren, making a total of 138 direct
descendants from the union of William
Henry Suttor and Charlotte Francis.
THE FALL OF MAN.
Here endeth the first lesson.
Mrs. Jessie Ilore, good pioneer and relict
of Andrew More, died on August 19, aged
87 years. She came to Australia as a girl
in 1829. With her husband she settled in
the Upper Murray district, 64 years ago.
Her first child was taken to Melbourne to
be baptised, the journey being made in a
bullock-dray.
THE ARISTOCRACY OF LETTERS.
WILLIAM BATESON, Professor of Biology,
the newly-elected president of the British
Association.
“T. 0.1.”: Laid to rest in St. Thomas's
Cemetery, North Sydney, Mrs. C. Lavinia
A. Finch (widow of Edward J. Finch), aged
97 years. The Finchs are of ancient resi-
dence in New South Wales. One of the
family, Charles Wray Finch, was in the 17th
Regiment when it was stationed in Sydney
in the 30’s of last century, and in 1855 was
elected member of the mixed Legislature
for Wellington and Bligh. He was Sergeant-
at-Arms from 1860 to 1873. Then he died,
and the job of throwing out the raving legisla-
tor passed into other hands, and the raving
legislator was kicked by younger feet.
Some State Parliaments take themselves
very seriously. The other • day Pea-
cock and co., of Victoria, seriously
inquired what steps would be neces-
sary if any untoward and sudden cir-
cumstances should render it advisable to pro-
long the life of the State Legislature for a
year or two, it being due for decease next
month. They learnt that it would take a
special Act of the Imperial Parliament to
do it—and Britain has no time for Aus-
tralian sub-Parliaments just now. But what
possessed anybody to imagine that the
Peacock Legislature might be suddenly and
especially wanted V
Willy Watt’s platform tactics may meet
with the approval of bitter partisans of the
Tory side, but they leave a nasty taste in
the mouths of those who can still appreciate
fairness, even in politics. Speaking at
Ballarat the other night, he said: “No man
of the Labor party is man enough to come
forward and argue this out with me, face
to face.” “I will,” promptly said one of
the audience, stepping forward. “I said a
man !” retorted Willy, and his admiring
supporters applauded his larrikinism to such
an extent that the subsequent remarks of the
challenger were lost.

larat, Victoria.]
It is not long since Prime Minister Cook
railed at the Maternity allowance and derided
it as a “bangle bonus.” When Orchard fought
the Nepean in the Cook interest, in 1913, he
used the same designation. Attorney-General
1 rvine has never concealed his hostility to the
grant. Nowadays, the Liberal candidate
vigorously denies that he is opposed to the
Maternity Allowance, and declares, with his
tongue in his cheek, that it is really a
Liberal measure, although introduced by a
Labor Government. Apparently a time will
come when every Liberal except Bruce Smith
will be a Laborite, and B. Smith will be so
wild at the general defection that he will
become a red revolutionist.

THE EXTRAORDINARY HERO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He never heard the bugles blow nor saw battalions

But grimly to his awful task he stuck beside the

And now upon his swelling breast he wears a
splendid string
Of medals. Not the treasured ones presented by
the King,
But ones evolved by staggered friends who saw the
work he did,
And knew how for immortal fame he’d made his
private bid.
Not his to lead the cheering columns o’er the shmi-
d’ring Rhine.
He read them in his home instead ! —he read them! —

The half-year’s profit therefore includes
18469 transferred to the two depreciation
funds. If it is necessary to write off that
much against bumps and barnacles and gen-
eral decay, then the true profit was £8497 ;
and even that allowed for a tidy margin
after paying the dividend at the reduced
rate of 7 p.c. The co. has never erred on
the side of extravagant distributions. The
next table puts a few of the items into
groups:—

Liquid assets . . . . 42,473 55,068 62,379
Liabilities . . . . 32,150 42,025 44,416
So in the past five years the book value of
steamships, freeholds and other non-liquid
assets has grown by £115,015, while the
surplus of liquid assets has moved on from
£10,323 to £17,903. -Meantime capital has
been increased from £170,000 to £204.000,
and £6BOO was received as premium on
shares ; total new capital got in. £40,800. Thus
the company lias spent £115,015 on ships, etc.,
and has £7640 more linuid assets after
providing for its debts. Of the £115.015
paid for vessels, etc., only £40,800 has
come out of the shareholders’ pockets; leav-
ing £74,215 to be provided by the business.
And at the same time £7640 of other assets
have been accumulated. This total of
£81,855 is in excess of the dividends. Even
allowing that depreciation for five years has
to he met out of this, it seems fairly clear
that the dividend has not been larger than
the circumstances justified. In 1909 the
total of the big item including steamships,
freeholds, leaseholds, etc., was only £225,643 ;
so more than one-third of that lot (including
freeholds) has been provided nominally for
depreciation. Wear and tear may be rapid,
but it is hardly as rapid as that.
The company was formed by the amalga-
mation of three comparatively small firms,
and for some time the shares were in few
hands. No doubt this explains the fact that
they were given a denomination of £lO. It
is now proposed to split them up into tens;
at the same time the capital is to be in-
creased from the present £204,000 to
£250,000, but only a portion of the 40.000
new shares are to be sent to market. They
are to be offered to present shareholders pro
rata , first payment to be not earlier than
October 1. The money is to go towards the
purchase of a new steamer now under order.

The company’s concession from the N.S.W.
Parliament was for 28 years, and this is
Hie 48th half-yearly report of the company.
That gives it four more years. But they
arc not going to he of such prosperity as
the co. has hitherto enjoyed. After wait-
ing 15 years too long the N.S.W. (Govern-
ment put through a Bill authorising a public
service for the big mining town at a cost
of about £300,000. The dam across the
Umberumberka Creek has been completed,
and notwithstanding the drought on the
Barrier —less than eight inches fell in 18
months —there is about four months’ supply
in that reservoir. The main (wooden pipes)
has been laid to the town, and the slow job
of reticulation is in hand. Broken Hill hav-
ing been hard hit by the stoppage of metal
exports, is clamoring for relief work, and
if the Government can find the cash pro-
bably this street work will be expedited.
In any ease it is doubtful whether tnis pri-
vate company will have throughout another
summer the extremely profitable job of sup-
plying the mines with water. Although it
may have the far smaller demand from the
town to attend to. Within 12 months from
now Umberumberka will be the main source
of supply. And this company’s service will
be little better than a stand-by. Its only
hope for anything better lies in the possi-
bility that some of the mines will not accept
the Government agreement submitted to
them. They are at present understood to
he sparring for better terms.
During the greater part of its life the
capital of the Broken Hill Water Supply
was £200.000, in £1 shares. Three-fourths
of this was repaid a few years ago. At
the expiration of the 28 years the works
are to be handed over to the State with-
out payment. On June 30. exclusive of
works, plant, tools and meters, the com-
pany's assets were valued at £81,430. Lia-
bilities were £4529, leaving a net surplus
of £76,910, equal to 7s. Bd. per share. Prac-
tically the whole of this is liquid, mostly
bank deposits. A trifle extra may be derived
from materials, etc., to which the State will
not be entitled. Nobody can tell what
profit from ordinary trading the company
will make in the few years left to it. Ordi-
nary working expenses are small, though
the outlay has been much larger than usual
of late, owing to the necessity for renewing
mains, etc., which naturally when first laid
were not designed to last much beyond the
28 years. The, officers reckon that this extra
expenditure is now done with. If so the
co. will no doubt still be able to pick up a
few crumbs well worth the eating.

This company was formed between three
and four years ago to take over a business
which was suffering from want of capital.
The terms were rather unusual. Instead
of paying ihe usual extravagant amount for
the goodwill of the business the vendors
practically paid the new co. a substantial
bonus for putting up the money. Conse-
quently, instead of beginning with the usual
deficit representing goodwill and prelimi-
nary expenses, there were reserves to start
with. The earlier results looked rather dis-
appointing. That, however, was due mainly
to dislocation of trade following upon a
change of premises. In 1912-13 the com-
pany got down somewhere to normal con-
ditions, and had the further advantage in
that and the past year of a better under-
standing in the wholesale drug trade than
had previously existed. No fireworks need,
however, be expected from the very sober-
sided management (Adam Forsyth, chair-
man of directors). The capital is £75,000.
There are £25,000 of 5 p.c. debentures and
other debts amount to £24,569. Against
this £124,569, there is stock in trade, £75,111,
and book debts (less provision for doubtful
debts, etc.), £46,335. There is plenty of
scope in these two items for such writing
down as would approximately equalise the
profits. On the other hand, no doubt, profits
might be overstated by overvaluing these
assets, but it doesn’t look the sort of man-
agement from which that error might be
expected. Provision is also made for the
depreciation of plant and fixtures. These,
with the freehold, are valued now at £20.061,
as against £20.106 12 months ago. The
company’s liabilities are the same to within
a few shillings as they were at June, 1913.
The profits which have been visibly reserved
have gone into stock, along with about
£l4OO, by which book debts have been re-
duced. Altogether, though there is nothing
effervescent about the accounts, they leave
a very pleasant taste behind them.

This Victorian Western District business is
now 57 years old. E. H. Lascelles, the
present chairman and general manager, did
not come into it until a mere 46 years ago,
though he had previously been in the late
C. J. Dennys’s service. After being 50
years in the business, 35 of them as general
manager, Mr. Lascelles invited his friends
and clients to come and join him. The
average profits for the preceding six years
had been £13,198. On the strength of that
he asked £50.000 for goodwill. This amount,
plus preliminary expenses, appears in the
table as a deficit; that is to say, it is capital
not represented by anything tangible. Not
only did the vendor agree to take the pur-
chase price in shares, but he also guaranteed
the 7 p.c. dividend on the full capital of
£150.000 for five years. The co.’s first year
was particularly unfortunate, especially in
the districts bordering on the Mallee, and in
the Mallee itself. Instead of the average
of £13,198 being reached the profit fell
about £lOOO short of the amount necessary
to pay the guaranteed dividend. The past
year was much more favorable, and under
the terms of the prospectus Mr. Lasoelles
gets his £lOOO back. It is typical of Ihe
spirit in which the business as between the
vendor and the company has been con-
ducted, that when the question of income
tax on dividends was raised Lascelles
settled a doubt which had arisen by under-
taking that the guaranteed 7 p.c. should be
free of tax. To some extent no doubt he
is protected, because during the five years
the dividend may not exceed 7 p.c. : accu-
mulated profits at the end of that time are
to be applied in reduction of goodwill. For
the ensuing year prospects are only mod-f
erate. owing to the extremely dry season in
the Western District, the Wimmera and
the Mallee. Both the grain crop and the
wool clip will be light. Places for grain
will no doubt be fairly high, which will
m(an extra commission earnings, but so far
iht' future as to wool is gloomy. The United
States and Japan may be buyers to an even
larger extent than hitherto, but they will
be largely free from the competition of Bel-
gians, French and Germans. And that is
going to make a difference in their bids.
As with most of these wool and grain
broking cos., Dennys, Lascelles have to
finance their clients pretty considerably.
Total liabilities at the end of the year were
£125,240, as against £117,336 12 months
previously. The bulk of this money is
represented by “sundry debtors £113,875”;
there are also bills receivable £26.150. With
I he debts to the company bundled up in this
way, it is impossible to even guess at the
risks carried. The advances may be safe
ones on wool and grain, etc., in store, or
much riskier ones on the security of Mallee
property and stock. Of the company’s own
capital of £150,000, £75.314 is in warehouse
and other freehold property, £50,000 in the
above-mentioned goodwill, and the balance
in plant, stuck and sundries.

-Besides paying a dividend for the third year
on end the directors are quite cheerful. The
output, they say, was a record, and yet the
demand was greater than the supply. If
things go on like this they will have to put
in additional plant, and they look forward
t.-> that cheerfully, because an increase in
the output would not mean a proportionate
increase in standing charges. By the time
the new plant is called for the dividends
may be attractive enough to secure new
capital from the shareholders. The trouble
with this, as with so many other Australian
manufacturing concerns, lias been that the
tariff protection was too small and too pre-
carious to justify the promoters in asking
for enough money to start with. Then when
they had made a start they usually, as in
this case, strained themselves to show a
decent profit, and among other things
neglected to make sufficient provision for
renewal and replacement of machinery. The
competition of the foreigner compelled them
to get in new plant or hold larger stocks
than they had figured on, and this meant
running to the bank for an overdraft. Fol-
lowing some such course this very deserving
Queensland Woollen Co. found itself in
extremities seven or eight years ago. It
was doubtful whether anything at all could
be saved for the shareholders. For a start,
and to break things gently to them, half
their capital was written off. That left
£23,340 nominally to their credit. The
banks’ interest in the concern at the same
time was £22,945. The business was
reorganised, and an attempt at direct deal-
ings with the public was abandoned. Profits
came very slowly. There is, however, a
tremendous lot of public spirit of the prac-
tical sort in Queensland. For instance,
there are men who make a point of insisting
on Queensland tweeds for their wear. This
and Queensland’s steady growth in pros-
perity enabled this co. to gradually raise its
chin off its chest, until now, as remarked at
the start, it begins to think that the world
isn’t such a dreary place after all. Steady
purchases have been made to improve the
plant, and have been paid for out of earn-
ings. Almost an exact £lO.OOO has gone in
that direction in the past six years. Mean-
time the debt to the bank has been worked
down from £22.945, as at .Tune, 1907. to
£15.150 at the end of the last half-year. It
would be a great deal better, of course, if it
were down to that many pence, because a
bank has an unpleasant habit of calling for
its interest, no matter whether the prin-
cipal has been having a bad time or a good
one. Apart from that the outlook is now
distinctly promising. Quite a lot of people
who will from this out ask for Australian
goods never thought a small thing like that
of any consequence hitherto. The fact that
German William is able now to put an army
of 3.000.000 men into the field, largely as
the result of their purchase of made-in-Ger-
many tweeds, etc., begins to have, for these
hitherto-bad Australians, an entirely new
significance.

As usual this co. has done a tremendous lot
of work for a comparatively small profit.
Of its own ore it extracted 147.577 tons. The
greater part. 139,991 tons, went to the lead
* mill, where it produced 24,059 tons of lead
concentrates. Old tailings were also put
through the regrinding mill, and 3336 tons
of concentrates were harvested. This makes
a total of 2L395 1 ns lead concentrates from
the co.’s own me. apart from the lead pro-
duct of the flotation plant. The company is
also a very large purchaser of other mines
products, hence the total quantity of concen-
trates and slimes fed into the smelters at
Port Pirie was 8(5,434 tons. It, therefore,
seems probable that the purchased material
was at least equal to the company’s own
output. In addition, there was a very large
draft upon the old stocks of tailings for toe
zinc (flotation) plant. To make its profit
of £1 (50,21)2, the company used up 147,5‘ s'
tons of its own ore plus probably 100,000
tons of old tailings, and also smelted the
purchased concentrates from say, 275,000
tons of ore. And at the same time, it carried
on as sidelines the production and sale of
sulphuric acid and spelter. Plainly, not-
withstanding the favoiable metal markets,
there was.little profit in the ore-purchase
business, judging, at any rate, by what other
Broken llill cos. are able to make out of
their ore and zinc tailings.
The least satisfactory feature of the busi-
ness (apart from the comparatively poor
financial result in general) is the miserable
proportion of zinc concentrates handled at
the zinc furnaces. The total output of metal-
lic spelter from the distillation plant was
2043 tons. The great bulk of the concen-
trates are still shipped to Europe—presum-
ably to Belgium and Germany. The attend-
ance on zinc retorts is not a pleasant job, yet
there are very few other unpleasant jobs
which Australians have not successfully
tackled. Probably as the result of the pre-
sent liolding-up of the business, an even
more determined effort will be made to in-
crease this very lucrative business of zinc
smelting in Australia. If the company
wants any assistance in that direction from
the Commonwealth Government it will, doubt-
less, now be forthcoming. Australia can see
more plainly the practical consequences of
building up the German metal trade.
The mine itself is still a good deal of a
lame duck. No estimate of ore reserves is
made, but there is probably something in the
neighborhood of 2,000,000 tons available.
That is five or six years’ supply at (he pre-
sent rate of extraction. Further efforts have
been made to locate parallel bodies, but with
negative results, and the limits of the mine s
resources have been practically determined.
Nor have the efforts to find other sizeable
mines given much result. The I’atosi. a few
miles north, is still being pecked at. but it
does not look as though it will give much of
a meal for this co.’s big plants. The future
beyond five or six years ahead rests mainly
with the Port Pirie lead and spelter plants
and the iron and steel works now getting
near completion at Newcastle. On the latter
works the eo. has spent £486,470, bringing
up the total outlay on this new national
enterprise to £651,400. besides considerable
sums spent at the source of iron ore supply
near the head of Spencer’s Gulf (S.A.). In
order to raise funds for this business there
was first an increase of share capital, and,
latterly, an issue of £600.000 of 6 p.c. deben-
tures, "which was over-subscribed. Although
this is expected to see the present plans
through, the Board lias decided to hang on to
the last dividend declared ; and the directors
intimate that they will continue operations
until they are, absolutely compelled to stop.
The fact that they produce metallic lead and
silver is. of course, in their favor. Of the
output of 40 409 tons of lead sold last half-
year 12.968 were sent to China. India and
.Japan, and of 22.341 sent to Europe the
greater, part is understood to go to England.

After showing a profit of £163,184 for the
half year the B. 11. North was one of the
mines which shut down almost as soon as
the trouble started in Europe. This sort of
thing is a national misfortune. The country
needs to produce every pound’s worth <>f
wealth it can at this time, in order to pay
for the absurd heap of imports and to meet
the inevitable interest bill on Australia’s
huge public and private debt. If it cannot
produce merchandise for the purpose it will
have to draw on its stock of gold. But though
gold is always good, silver is an unstable
metal. The working account of the N. 8.11.
shows that the output for the six months
was worth £300.995. Of this amount the co.
spent in wages £139.070, and then sent its
output of zincy tailings to the Amalgamated
Co. for further treatment, and that meant
probably another £65,000. To continue
operations of this character is one of the
first needs of the moment.
The North occupies in relation to the
Broken Hill lode much the same position on
one end as the Smith does on the other,
though it is scarcely so great a property.
.Nevertheless they had this in common —they
did not develop their best resources until
they were comparatively deep mines. The
principal work apart from sloping has lately
been at the 1400 ft. level, where a good deal
of opening up has been done during the six
months. In crosscuts well apart the body

is here from 110 to 112 feet wide, and the
average value appears to be 10 p.c. lead,
lOoz. silver and 11 p.c. zinc. This com-
pares very favorably with the average value
throughout the mine. During the term 156,020
tons of ore was milled from all parts, worth
H).l p.c. lead, 7.60 z. silver, 13.5 p.c. zinc.
Ihe zinc contents alone of the bottom level
are a trifle less than the average, but the
siiver values are considerably better. Fur-
ther, there is nothing to suggest that the
ore is a more refractory milling proposition.
In this respect the North has always been
well favored. Apart from slimes the mill
makes three products—lead concentrates,
which go to the smelters direct; zincy tail-
ings, which are sold to the Amalgamated
Co.; and quartz tailings, which are the refuse
and are used for underground filling. The
separation is so good that the quartz tailings
carry only 2.7 p.c. lead, 2.50 z. silver and
No p.c. zinc. This means that 05.9 p.c. of
the lead, 91.8 p.c. of the silver, 85.1 p.c. of
the zinc in the original ore are saved in
products which go on for further refining,
bt course the ultimate recoveries are less
because of losses in the flotation and smelt-
ing processes. Nevertheless, as a record in
preliminary concentration., the figures are
something for George Weir and his associ-
ates to be proud of.
i ir° es^ma te °f ore reserves is made this
lalt-year. Six months ago the directors
io4i el ' e , were 2,000,000 tons above the
- i , anf a Probable 1,300,000 between that
and the 1400 ft. As the 1400 ft. crosscuts,
etc., have borne out the bore results, the total
figures may now be reasonably accepted. The
ore milled in the six months was 156,020
ions. This means that, with an extraction
continued on recent lines, ore developed is
'qual to 104 years’ supply, and there is no
reason whatever to suppose that an ore body
110 ft. wide at 1400 ft. cuts out suddenly.
, 10 n f°r the half-year was equal to
I, ,s - lid. per ton of ore. This, however,
allows nothing for depreciation of plant;
tbe odd lid. would probably cover that for
the half-year. If a profit per ton of £1
irtuld be depended upon there will thus be,
say, £3,.,00.000 in sight, equal to £5 10s. per
snare. the moral markets cannot, however,
be depended upon to be always so favorable,
lhe lowest price for lead during the half-
,\ear was £l7 2s. od., whereas the average
lowest price for the preceding six years bad
been £lo is. Od. The lead contents of the
lead concentrates and the zincy tailings pro-
duced in the six months were 21.937 tons.
Assuming, then, that the average lead market
is to las. lower than it was for the past six
months, Ihe profit under average conditions
would be about £82.000 less—that is from lead
ulone and assuming, further, that the co. is
paid for all the lead. This would mean cut-
tmg the profits in sight in halves—a pretty
a H indication of ihe enormous influence
winch fluctuating metal values have upon the
profits and capital values of such under-
la kings.

The directors of Mount Lyell, Broken Mill
and some of the North Queensland mining
cos. met m Melbourne last week to evolve
a uniform scheme for keeping their mines
going. Nothing much was done, as appar-
ently each company has to fall back on its
banker as of yore; and the banks are sup-
posed to be feeling a little better at pre-
sent because of the arrangement whereby
they get three Commonwealth £1 notes for
each £4 of gold they hold. As long as the
banks can clearly see their way to finance
me ruining cos. over a long period, say, 18
months, the arrangement might be quite
good enough. All that one can say at this
juncture is that the arrangement is quite
satisfactory to the banker. He’ll carry tin'
risk so long as it appears quite safe to
mm. and then one may expect that the
mining cos. will be thrown upon the Gov-
ernment for direct support. On the face
ot it,. direct support seems inevitable, unless
a fairly free market is available for the
products. day fresh indications pro-
sent themselves that the chief industry of
lhe world is for a time likely to be war, and
industrial markets, in the strict sense
ot the term, will be quite suspended. As a
result of the mining cos.’ conference all that
seems to be known is that lead smelting will
continue in Australia. The B. 11. Prop.
Co. s works at Port Pirie will share with
he Sulphide Corporation’s Cockle Creek the
leady concentrates produced on the Barrier,
lhe ± ort Pirie works will, as usual, refine
the lead and silver, and it may be expected
that Cockle Creek will continue to ship its
silver-lead bullion to England for refining.
But what of the zinc concentrates? It may
be that an outlet will be found in the
united States; but before Australia begins
negotiations with a new man to do its zinc
smelting and refining, the Government might
well say that the concentrates could be
stocked here for a time, and see if somebody
could not be induced to seriously begin the
business here. It is well known that Aus-
to-day has an opportunity to say to the
zinc interests of the world: “We are going
to take the hand in this business that we
are entitled to.” If the Government began
to stock zincs here the zinc world at the end
of the war would find, for the time at all
events, that Australia held the big hand.
And Australia would then have to be reck-
oned with. Up to the present it has been
merely toyed with. This is an opportunity
which should not be allowed to sup. It is
certain the arrangements which have been,
or are being, made with the various bankers
will prove an expedient of practical use only
if the war is of short duration. Further,
the number of mining cos. which are capable
of making the arrangement with a bank is
very limited, because the banks will take
practically no risk. The copper mines whose
product contains no precious metals were
almost all cancelled right from the jump,
and so the scheme is but half a scheme after
all.
So far The Bulletin sees nothing which
is better than the idea set out in last issue,
vis., that a conference be called between the
Government, the Opposition, the Labor
people and the various mining cos., to settle
a scheme whereby all the reputable mines
shall be kept going by putting in stock for a
time all the products that cannot be satis-
factorily disposed of. Meanwhile, a special
Government paper issue would provide the
wherewithal to pay for the cost of produc-
tion.

The Mammoth (N.Q.) has had a worse bit
of luck than usual. Just before William
unsheathed his sword and set out on a
personally-conducted tour to Paris, the
mostly-Scotch people who own the properties
had an agent busy in Germany. The scheme
in his head was to form a new company with
a capital of £300,000, including £lOO,OOO of
7 p.c. debentures. One of the big German
banks which specialise in industrial concerns
had undertaken the debenture issue on condi-
tion that £lOO.OOO of share capital was
raised. And half of this latter had been
underwritten when the bottom fell out of
things. The Scotch people and their Aus-
tralian friends already had visions of £lOO,OOO
in cash and £lOO,OOO in shares as their slice,
the visions being all the brighter because of
the very favorable reception given by a big
London-Melbourne crowd to a proposal that
they should be responsible for the other
£50,000 not taken in Germany. Everything
is off, including the working staff at tin*
mine. The smelting campaign stopped with
a sudden jerk when the before-mentioned
William bared the also previously-mentioned
cutlery.
Occidental Gold (N.S.W.) cyanided 1731
tons of slimes for 4870 z. gold, and the mill
produced 15 tons of concentrates containing
150 oz. So the fortnight’s run gave approxi-
mately 5370 z., or an average of slightly over
7dwt. per ton. Assays taken from 1441 tons
hauled during the fortnight averaged Bdwt.
Sgr. per ton. The usual extraction is 85
p.c. of the assay value. From No. (i level
796 tons were hauled, averaging from 6dwt.
to 7dwt. Sgr. per ton. At Mitchell’s stope
the limit has been reached at the north end,
but further south there is an ore-body 30ft.
wide. They have made a start to sink
another winze from No. 5 level, and have
advanced the north drive at No. 6 level
(640 ft. vertical) to 185 ft. from the crosscut.
This drive continues in good ore, worth
14dwt. per ton, but the payable ore here-
abouts is narrow. A rise, which is being
put up from this northern drive, is up 17ft.
above the back of the level. This work pro-
duced 16 tons of stone, worth 14dwt. per
ton, which also indicates rather a narrow
lode compared with other places in the mine.
Llanberris No. 1, Ballarat East (Vic.),
manages to make both ends meet at a time
when the closing of the Stock Exchanges
threatens call-paying with extinction. The
last mine tally was 33210 z. from 12,045 tons
crushed, and pyrites worth over £lOOO. Go.
breaks stone from 1030 ft. and 1130 ft., so it is
putting up a fair record when it can earn
profits and at the same time test the big
block of ground to the north by driving at
1030 ft. After all, such mining is a despair-
ful relic of the policy generally followed in
Ballarat. There the formations are suffici
ently assured to be developed ahead and
beaten out in style, and every time a few
pounds are earned in profits they are paid
away in divs. The result is a constant
scramble to keep the flag flying, and the
scramble ends very often in a reconstruction
and a great effort to get a bit more cash
until another payable patch can be found.
It takes a pretty strong magnifying glass
to pick out results at the Easter Monday
mine, Blackwood (Vic.). Co. has what if
terms a big make and a little make. As
about 130 tons have to go to get a color of
330 z. from the bulge of quartz in the big
shoot, there isn’t much of a margin left.
Profit, therefore, must come from the little
make. This would serve if it were not so
microscopic, for the stone goes 18dwt. per
ton. The present-day trouble is that there
is no evidence that the battery can be kept
going, or whether this gem of a reef carries
its richness down in the tricky Blackwood
country.
* * * *
More excuses have been written over the
Cassilis (Gippsland) than over almost any
other show in Victoria. Formerly it was
plant troubles, or want of gold, or too-
refraetory ore. Now it is dry weather. So
stiff has been the drought that the directors
couldn’t take all the Government grant held
out to them. The Board even lets manager
Lilburne publish the Bulletin advice,
given in Coote’s time, that the Cassilis could
never rely on regular power until it con-
served a decent water supply. So far. all
it has done has been to put up £21.500 for a
hydro-electric plant that stands still for half
the year. This want has driven the co. back
£2815 for the last six months, whereas if
Power had been available only bad manage-
ment could have kept profits from being
earned. Developments below No. 6 level on
the Cassilis reef, and the prospect of getting-
on a decent stone on the Ceresa reef, furnish
reasons why Lilburne’s recommendations
should be followed. Costs would fall at
once, and, as profits came, a look-in at the
other reefs on the property could be
attempted.
During ils last half-year to June 30, Mount
Bischoff (Tas.) sold its tin at an average of
£lO2 Bs. per ton, and handled its crude ore
at os. 4.24 d. per ton, so it can only reason-
ably account for its miserable profit of
£13,509 by owning up that its milling
material follaway in grade. With a profit
of only £13,509 there was little to justify a
distribution of more than 20s. per share, but
the shareholders were spoon-fed with 355.
per share (£21,000). In boom times Bischoff
had got into the habit of paying 10s. per
month, which required £30,000 a half-yea 1 *
and it was on the strength of these dividends
that shares boomed to £OO, for it was appar-
ently imagined that the luck would hang out
for at least 10 years. Bischoff's reserves
total 1.902,000 tons, which is enough to keep
the mill running up to its full capacity for
eight years.
Kulamadau (Woodlark Island) finds it
necessary to make a call of 2d. per share.
The return for six weeks ended July 15 was
401 oz. smelted gold and 38 tons ilewt. of
concentrates ; 800 tons of sand for 91oz. made
the total value approximately £2248 from
1738 tons of stone, an average of nearly
265. per ton. And this in six weeks from
a low-grade mine encumbered with a big-
swag of shares isn't sufficient, particularly
as it has always been alleged that there are
wide faces of pay ore. No. 5 west level,
for instance, is in 120 ft., with 7ft. of ore in
present end. A low-grade mine should have
a mill capable of handling a large tonnage,
and if Block 10 takes over the Kulamadau
some improvement in the mill and the water-
supply will have to be considered. Although
the climate thereabouts is generally very
damp, the mine has experienced a shortage
ot water, and -'erliaps that helps to explain
a loss of £1142 for the half-year.

were treated during that period for a return
of £133,807. Expenditure absorbed £126,477,
and the balance was mopped up by a 6d.
dividend and sundries. The merit of the

averaged only a shade over odwt. Ore re-
serves are siiil estimated at 173,383 tons
worth 51dwt. and 92,120 tons of partly-
developed sj'dwt. stuff. On the whole, the
year’s developments are considered by the
Board to have been very satisfactory. Good
lengths of ore of higher average value than
the reserves have been exposed at one point
in the main and at two points in Morty’s
or western workings, one stretch at the
1000 ft. level of Morty’s being estimated to be
worth Oldwt. over sft. for 84ft., with an
additional 7ft. of high-grade stone in one
of the walls of the drive. Co. is so pleased
with the past few months’ results in the
South Kalgurli lease that it is now turning
some attention to the northern portion of tho
Hainault, which is unprospected ground and
is said to show good indications.
Westralian Chamber of Mines gives the
State Government a bump over mining acci-
dent statistics for 1913. It alleges (1) that
accidents classed as serious in the Mines
Department’s report for that year are inaccu-
rate and consequently unfair to the industry,
and (2) that there is good ground for assert-
ing that much malingering on the
part of the men claiming to have
been disabled is responsible for such
inaccuracy. It venomously adds that
since the Workers’ Compensation Act, 1912,
came into force a large number of trivial
cases have been made to extend for the
statutory 14 days so. as to claim compensa-
tion from date of accident. Finally it up-
braids the Mines Department for adopting
a system that might cause those unacquainted
with the actual position to view it with
alarm.
“Oof Bird” (W.A.) : Seven small items:
Minister Collier and the Chamber of Mines
have mediated successfully in the Yuanmi
contract system dispute ; the Whim Well Co.
has forked out what it owed to its staff and
men; the derelict Golden Eagle and North
l’ole formerly held by the busted Westralia
United Goldfields Ltd. is on offer to anyone
seeking bankruptcy ; a further 13440 z. from
402 tons has been won from the Nil Desper-
andum at Laverton ; and the Adelaide Enter-
prise is confident that its Kalgoorlie show
will confound its critics. Impossible.
Chaffers is well forward with the reorganisa-
tion of its sulphide plant, and expects to
turn out gold again in September. Several
of the Kalgoorlie mining cos. have curtailed
development in order to conserve their stocks
of explosives and cyanide.

In all 20 men were killed and 741 in-
jured in Westralian mines last year. Eight
deaths were due to falls of rock, seven to
accidents in shafts, four were classed as
“miscellaneous,” four were the result of
surface mishaps, and machinery and explo-
sives accounted for the other three. Of the
741 disabled men who escaped with their
lives 542 were hurt while underground and
.199 on the surface. Of the totals 11 men
were killed and 403 injured at Kalgoorlie.
The Bulletin again asks when is that
Westralian Miners’ Accident Fund coming?
The thing has had a dozen years’ experience
now in N. S.-Wales, and has done so much
good and been worked with so little friction
that the failure to extend it to Westralia is
one of the unpardonable sins of the Scaddan
Government.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 24, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
The Sydney Mayoral hop to the Men of
Science will give these bewildered lions
every opportunity to show how little they
know of official Lancers —as a non-com-
ha tan t evening amusement —this (Monday)
evening. As my letter is gummed up before
the event you won't hear this week, Arini.
whether Sir Oliver Lodge can or cannot
dance the one-step ragtime.
The arrival of the Scientists by rail from
Melbourne was chopped into three sections.
It was mostly an affair of sorting out biolo-
gists from mathematicians or zoologists, and
rushing them off to their right pigeon-holes.
Sydney hosts and hostesses lined up to track
their particular lion or lioness (the latter
was rather a negligible quantity in the
recent invasion), and hunted them with fair
success. The difficulty of giving a hearty
greeting to a person you have never seen in
your life before led to minor complications.
The spectacled brigade grappled with all its
lighter baggage, while Professor David’s coat-
tails flew round the scenery as he pounced
on absent-minded-looking gentlemen with
Nonconfoi mist whiskers and handed them
over to their temporary owners. Mrs. Ash-
burton Thompson was on the platform in
search of something that was to step out of
the last special cars. Professor Warren —-
leaving his bulldog at home —set forth early
to catch his prey, the Professorial Coker.
Aides Wakeman and d’Apice, with the Gover-
nor's official Secretary, Mr. Budge, lurked
round to run down anything that looked like
the Bateson party—the large biologist and
his upstanding British matron —and Sir
Charles Lucas. The latter, a mild old gentle-
man who was here as an official feeler from
the Colonial Office a while ago, acted as a
signpost to the Bateson identity.
We haven’t seen such a line display of
whiskers for years as the Men of Science
produced at Government House garden
party. Neither they, simple learned folks
(with none of the pomposity of some of our
local ’Varsity clique), nor their wives seem
to care a straw for the mere wrapping up of
the human animal. They dress for warmth,
with a certain deference to modern fashion
-—the males in wearing hats not more than
20 years behind the millinery of our gilded
youths. The Scientific ladies so far unbend
as to be aware, in the person of Mrs. Bate-
son anyhow, that the female head is fre-
quently covered at fashionable entertain-
ments with a flat straw plate rolled down
towards the ears, and stuffed with a thick
undergrowth of artificial herbage.
The Stricklands, surrounded by a glitter-
ing staff’, laid in wait for the garden-party
crowd on the Cranbrook lawn that overlooks
the sunset. The spectacled brigade mingled
with local society immediately after its arri-
val, and stared amiably at the gewgaws of
our Best People. The tall Mrs. McMurray
beat her own sartorial record at the Bateson
lecture (silver and black creation) by her
garden-party drapery of cream lace. * Mrs.
David Hall, in purple, with a dash of fine
linen or lawn at the throat, was another
comely Australian who caught the absent-
minded gaze of a learned butterfly man. The
arrival of Mrs. Premier Holman in a tango
frock contributed a streak of color, which
was challenged by the gorgeous green gar-
ments of Mrs. Phil Morton. The learned
dames’ contingent—Lady Schafer, in bright
blue, made the most vivid attack on color—
was mostly clad in the nondescript mouse
tints so dearly loved by the middle-class
British matron. The botanical Miss Saun-
ders, however, let her fancy stray to a more
lively combination of fuchsia tones. Miss
Louisa Macdonald, M.A., of the Women’s
College, the Anderson Stuarts (who house the
great Schafer and his lady and the Profes-
sorial Haliburtons), the Schofields, and the
extreme length of Prof. Fawsitt, made a
solid helping from the local Uni. centre of
Academic frills. There were so many tons of
amateur war critics at the party that the
gamp of Universal Peace, unfurled in a
few soft asides by Miss Rose Scott, didn’t
wave worth half a pound of “Rule Britan-
nia”—-as served out by the band. Chamber
of Commerce President Braddon. refusing to
be drawn into a Peace argument, urged the
necessity of feeding our fighting material
from the start.
President Bateson, of the Science Con-
gress. opened the whirl of learning here witli
an illuminating lecture on the power of
heredity. The learned and the unlearned
clasped their red or green tickets and
splashed through a muddy night to drink in
tlie wonderful Tale of Man in all his moods.
The speaker didn’t pitch his voice quite high
enough to dumbfound the Town Hall echoes.
The audience at the back complained that
it heard nothing. By its patient silence,
therefore, the great biologist can know that
we are a reasonably polite people. Some
of the Science delegates who were weary
after the jolt by Melbourne express that
morning slept peacefully in the body of the
hall, while the Bateson voice floated over
the front seats. Fierce indignation, how-
ever, has since been expressed by a group
of Sydney searchers for biological know-
ledge, because one of the famous Whiskers
party snored so loudly that he drowned
some of the lecturer’s deductions.
Bateson argues that you can improve the
human stock up to a certain point, and hints
that the introduction of Welsh singers, etc.,
might even, in course of time, make Eng-
land a musical nation. “But,” said he,
“could a nation so changed be still classed
as the same people?” There are cer-
tain strains in the vegetable and
animal kingdom that will never, under
l lie best conditions, give the best results.
Briefly, the Man of Learning seemed
to boil down his remarks to a technical ex-
planation that you can’t make a silk purse
out of an ox-tail.
Sir Edward Schafer, rising up to reply
to a vote of thanks, said: “Though
there are many who may not agree
in full with all we have heard in Professor
Bateson’s magnificent address, far be it from
me to dare to differ from him. I read in
an evening paper that he has a wild, blue
eye, a brown moustache, and is likely to be
of a truculent disposition. Still I would
like to say that the wildness of his eye, when
the reporter saw Mr. Bateson at the station
this morning, was due to the fact that lie
was looking for his luggage.”
The Bulletin’s invaluable “Hop” has
come ashore after a five months’ trip abroad
intact, except for an injured finger. This
digit, which came to grief on the voyage out,
is almost convalescent, or hopes to be so very
shortly. “Hop,” who was disappointed in
the American press of to-day, was lucky
enough to meet record fine weather for some
motor trips through the south of England. He
met in London the Sydney violinist Leila
Waddell, who does very well on the other
side.
“Music,” says “Hop,” who can growl on
the ’cello himself, “has reached a much
higher standard in London since I was
there last, and clever trick or vaudeville
fiddle turns are actually necessary to financial
success, if quite good violinists, for example,
are to attract notice in the plethora of
talent. News of. the war was flashed to us
on board the Tahiti in mid-ocean. AVe had two
or three American Scientists on board, and
they were apt to mistake A r enus for the
searchlight of the enemy’s cruisers. I may
say that we never saw any other sign of the
enemy except our old friend A r enus. This
was officially reported to the captain when
low on the horizon (the captain wasn’t low
on the horizon) by one of our learned fellow-
passengers. I believe he would like to have
placed the planet under arrest, out of regard
for our common welfare.”
Captain AA 7 allis, lately of the Strickland
Help Department, dashed overland to Mel-
bourne, after a slight mishap, which delayed
the craft that was to have taken him to join
the European fray. In Melbourne he is
likely to join the Australian overseas force,
as Staff Captain and Orderly Officer to
Colonel McCaju a militia warrior who is
booked for service. This is not an official
ultimatum, but it is a reliable rumor. When
the argument with Kaiser Bellicose is over,
the sporting Irish Wallis hopes to return to
his peaceful billet in the Strickland kinder-
garten.
The general meeting of the Girls’ Realm
Guild was held in the sub-regal ballroom the
other afternoon, with the Strickland lady-
ship—whose health seems to be improving—
in the chair. Mrs. David, in her most con-
vincing school-marm manner, was the Guild’s
mouthpiece. The G.R.G. is now forming
itself into a unit of the Red Cross organisa-
tion. and is up to its neck in bandages and
ambulances lectures. Mrs. Macarthur Onslow
handed it £5 to go on with. The Cullen lady
murmured her approval. The meeting, which
was supported by practical helpers like Mrs.
Curlewis, Mrs. Tom Hughes, and Mrs. John
Fell, from the backwoods of Lane Cove River
—with Agnes Mowle as the voice of the
Cranbrook girls’ centre —munched the sar-
dine sandwich of peace after recording its
profound conviction that it would be There
when wanted.
“Supposing,” said a lady bandager at a
recent ambulance meeting, “you had a very
tall man to bandage, and a very short strip
of stuff to do it with — er—ivhat would you
do next?” “Good gracious me. madam,” said
the irate medico, “you don’t bandage a man
ali over because he’s got a broken leg!” Then
he whispered softly to himself —not for pub-
lication.
The Little Theatre matinee for the Red
Cross funds will have collected most of its
cash before this strikes you all of a heap.
Walter Bentley as Macbeth (very Scotch),
in two scenes from that gloomy murder-
play, was magnificently kilted and studded
to his knees with large brass knobs. Ihese
ornaments glittered like door handles as
Macbeth prompted Mrs. Macbeth (Mrs. Bob
Mac-kinnon) in a deep, -bass whisper. Mrs.
Alex. Gordon, a long way below her usual
form, sang “Land of Hope and Glory. it
the amateur accompanist, during this effort,
had been rushed into a corner and firmly
requested not to interfere with the singer,
Hope , and Glory might have dragged them-
selves to the front as if they hadn’t been
beaten up with a thin wire whisk. The best
performances of the afternoon were contri-
buted by Pianist Laurence Phillips and H.
R Roberts. Dr. Reuter Roth, a tall pillar
of St. John Ambulance, made a few remarks,
and regretted the absence of Mrs. George
Earp, who helped to push the matinee into
shape. The Admiralty lady cautiously felt
her wav into a seat when the lights were
low. Mrs. Wilfred Docker, in the audience,
remains as persistently cheerful as Mark
Tapley in spite of things in general and
special editions in particular. The Neville
Maymans were firmly entrenched near our
municipal mother, Mrs. Richards. Mrs.
Ted Antill lent her aid to the phalanx of
lady bushrangers who sold flowers and
sweets for “anything you like to give.” The
programme ended with a mixed prayer
“God Save the King and Country.”
The most graphic daily paper reference
to the late and great Pope was written by
that joyous pagan, Randolph Bedford, who
once gripped the gentle papal hand in his
cyclonic list.
Artist Arthur Streeton, though he lias
stumbled on a difficult patch for Art just
now, exhibits about <SO samples of bis method
in oils this week. There will be 40 water-
colors besides —so the choice for buyers is
wide. The Streeton show begins on Thurs-
day, August 27 —a private view day : —and
goes on (ill about September 10. Panels
depicting scenes on our blue water front —a
Sydney line that sells readily in Melbourne —
are included in these wares, which hang < n
the R. A. Society’s walls, in Vickery’s
Chambers.
Magistrate Stephen Murphy and his wife,
who hail from the rose gardens of Strath-
field, are still in Britain. He is a Chil-
dren’s Court authority when he is a
“Washup” hereabouts, and his business is to
peer into the motives that incite small boys
to stone windows, and arm themselves with
pea-rifles for piratical purposes. Mr.
Murphy is pursuing his hobby on the other
side, by picking up first-hand information re
British methods of suppressing crime in
knickerbockers and flagrant acts of dis-
honesty done by infants on the feeding-
bottle.
Misclia Elman’s brilliant attack on the
fiddle the other evening gave the encore
fiends every excuse for demanding double
value for their money. The huge Concerto
in G Minor by Max Bruch incited the Rus-
sian prodigy to turn himself into a whole
orchestra, and carve out magic music by the
yard. The famous “Faust Fantasie” again
introduced the mixed company and the smell
of brimstone in that opera to an ecstatic
audience. Warbler Eva Gauthier flung the
French language at the rafters in our Town
Barn, with a few sparkling glances to close
the argument. Her black coiffure now
climbs half a foot or so high, in a stiff Red
Indian mop that makes the gay little face
under it look like a very small threepenny
bit. Percy Kahn, at the piano, hits that
long-suffering instrument with a velvet touch
as accompanist.
Frank Grimley—of the AVoolwich family
so much addicted to sonatas —sends a joyful
line to say that two daughters who were in
Berlin just before the row began are now in
London. They didn’t wait for their luggage, or
it was lost in the general upheaval. The
Woolwich damsels will return, as per in-
voice, via America.
The Girls’ Realm AVild Flower Show has
to go on as arranged, though the times, as
someone remarked in blank verse a long
while ago, are out of joint. To disarrange
ibis fixture means a dead loss of £lO0 —
representing deposit on Town Hall rent, and
other outlay incurred before Europe got into
a furious rage. So a big helping of ambu-
lance work and other topical subjects will
be bandaged round Australian flora. The
opening day is September 3. The malinee
in Her Majesty’s for the Patriotic Fund is
now booked for the same date. Organising-
secretary Grace Burrows is pulling her
forces together after this blow, and hopes to
tramp forward to steady business in the
Girls’ three days’ campaign for cash.
Young David (of the Sydney Uni. house-
hold) is going to the fray, wherever it may
be. He is a newly-fledged Sawbones, and a
smart youth besides, who’ll give a good
account of himself when wanted.
Our youngest alderman (so far as I
know), Jack Playfair, of the AVaverley
Council, is arming for the crusade. He has
had some training in the cult of fireirons.
etc.
The Freddie Shipmans changed their
plans quite twice, owing to the prolonged
Dufault season here. These blithe birds of
nrissage will almost certainly leave for the
States about: the end of this month.
Mrs. Mick Dalton, the pretty, grey-eyed
Irish girl who married one of the Orange
(N.S.W.) Daltons, is still in Britain on a
visit. When the last mail fled headlong
out of London, Mrs. Mick was going to the
Emerald Isle to see her mother.
F. 0. Dunstan, a son of the late J. 11.
Dunstan (Adelaide) and editor of the
Australasian Record, a Sydney publica-
tion, has persuaded Mrs. Florence Ivnowl-
man to say the same old affirmative. The
attractive widow, who has recently returned
from the other side, was a one-time Mayor-
ess of Goulburn.
The lion, director of the Barmaids’ Homes
(London), Mr. William Baker, sends along
a plea for The Bulletin’s interest in its
work. A portion of its illustrated annual
report is pegged out as space for the letters
in which ex-barmaids, boys and girls, write,
mostly from Canada, of their steady tramp
to a decent livelihood. (Just here I find the
keyword is “Barnardo,” not "Barmaid.")
Tlie Barnardo charter is, "No destitute child
ever refused admission.” The homes are
likely to need elastic-sides during the coming
year', and any spare coppers from Aus-
tralia will be accepted with enthusiasm. The
head office is 18-26 Stepney Causeway,
London East.
The large Irishman, Denis McSweeney, of
the twinkling diamond scarf pin (it was a
presentation from some Noo Yark citi-
zens, and it illuminated the McSweeney
presence while in Sydney), writes
from Gotham City. lie is a per-
sonal friend and general watchdog of
John McCormack’s interests when the tenor
is raking in the shekels on tour. Concern-
ing John’s recent golden harvest in America,
the McSweeney says: "Forty-seven concerts
in three months, the gross receipts £33,000 —
not dollars. McCormack returns for another
tour —November to May. Already the lowest
amount guaranteed for any one appearance
is £460. In Toronto he is getting a guaran-
tee of nearly £lOOO for one concert.... Dur-
ing one part of the last McCormack tour we
had the chastened joy of gazing on the ther-
mometer at 47° below zero. This was at a
place called Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada.
. . . .Other experiences during this trip found
John held up for 48 hours in a train in
Southern California —floods. He was snow-
bound in Minnesota for 30 hours, was shaken
up in a railway wreck on the path
from I thick to N. Y. City, and sang
next evening to 1000 people, with
his arm in a sling, at Paterson, New
Jersey... .American dollars are. so big and
plentiful as far as McCormack is concerned
that it is unlikely we’ll see Australia again
for quite a few years.”
Alice Grant Bosnian, formerly The
Bulletin’s Adelaide correspondent, is
responsible for a new novel called "Miss
Bryde of England.” The clever Australian
girl, whose book will shortly emerge from
the linotypes of publisher Andrew Melrose,
has been turning out a lot of magazine
articles and short stories since she settled
down to the Inky Way in London.
Gordon Inglis, who used to be a Sydney
pressman, gave the Australasian tennis team
a glorified snack at the Savoy Hotel before
the white-flannel brigade left England for the
U. States. Norman Brookes and A. F. Wild
ing replied to the speeches in praise of their
prowess. Tennis —let us rejoice over the
fact —is a peaceful game. The crowd from
Paddington or Collingwood doesn’t slay the
umpire. No one fires off cannon and fill:',
the trenches with dead. The lion lies down
with the racquet and the lamb eats the ball,
and everything is peace.
Scientist Oliver Lodge, who is a good-
looking likeness of Darwin, with less whiskes.
is as gentle as a cooing dove when he talks
of the Mysterious Beyond. The Lyceum Ilall
was packed beyond its limits for the Lodge
lecture on Sunday afternoon. The good man
was mildly perturbed to see women folk
standing at the back, and mildly surprised
that so many citizens should rush his
remarks. Lodge, like most shining lights of
learning, is most tolerant of every opinion
however antagonistic to his own —and looks
over the material hedge at the ether beyond,
as meekly as a school kiddie at his first
primer.
Another wedding that was bustled along
last week in consequence of the bridegroom
packing up his kit for active service was the
knot-tying of Miss Katie Palmer, a daughter
of Mr. O. Palmer, of North Sydney, and
Mr. Arthur Fisher, from the same huge
suburb.
Word drops in that Miss Barlow, the only
unmarried daughter of the naval Barlows, is
engaged to a son of Government Astronomer
Cooke.
The Wild Life Preservation Society is
clamoring to the Inter-State Commission for,
a stricter censorship of the feathers that we
inport from other countries. The startling
statement that ladies who fondly think they
are swathed in marabou fluff are really
decorated with the fluff from our barn-yard
cacklers, is another surprise. Government
Analyst Hamlet may insist on marabou
coming under the Pure Foods Act of some-
thing similar.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Melbourne, August 24, 1014.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Last week my remarks about a suburban
charity hop became involved with a desciip-
tion of the Gaud Mayoral Science Congiess
entertaiumeut. To my unspeakable rage, I
was made to represent the G.-G. lady as hay-
ing attended a suburban children s dance <n
a red, white and blue hat. The responsible
party, or idiot, may either have been the
Censor, or the person who sub-edits my liter-
ary efforts, or the comp. All I want to men-
tion is that it was not your faithful Johanna.
There is a gentlemanly way of being
utterly ignored, which some of our native-
born big-wigs would do well to study. At
the Government House party of welcome to
the British scientists, the just-arrived mem-
bers had to line up and abase themselves
before vice-royalty, while nice, clean-looking
Scotch footmen held back the surging mass
of ordinary beings with a fat, woolly rope.
The G.-G. and his lady awaited the multi-
tude on the blue plush dais, also State
Governor Stanley. Each scientist bobbed
reverentially to the Fergusons as he (or she)
passed, but there was nary an obeisance for
the State representative of the Throne and
Person. It is sickening to have to mention
that most of the researchers cut him dead.
He took it splendidly. Very few could have
survived the withering snubs hurled at him
by the guests. One sort of important' person
would have collapsed and hidden himself
tearfully in the turquoise and gold folds of
Lady Helen’s skirts; another would have
snorted audibly and so spoiled the recep-
tion (loud snorts being inimical to an atmo-
sphere of loyalty) ; and a third variety
would have incontinently burst. Let it go
down in the proud annals of our race that
Governor Stanley looked neither more
excited nor less bored than if he had been
listening to a series of hymn-tunes sung by
a choir of village children.
A man who knows all about troop trans-
port work has given me a tip concerning
presentation literature. lie deprecates the
habit of unloading cheap magazines and
trashy novels on our departing braves. They
are necessarily travelling light, on luxuries,
and so the chances are that sacks of
these well-meant presents will have to
be dumped overboard. Of course, in
the long, forced waits in camp, books are
devoured. A man reads things in such cir-
cumstances that would bore him stiff in the
pining times of peace. The Bible is read
for fun. Shakspeare’s solidest play becomes
as absorbing as a picture show. The best
line for book-donors is to pick out one good,
long, and yet compact, classic —the sort that
will stand reading and re-reading—and fire
it along. That type of volume goes the
whole round of the force, and often has a
second circulation, and is an uncountable
blessing in every way. Better in war-time
a pound or so of Scott or Dickens than half
a ton of Marie Corelli.
Beatrice Day has started a B.D. Copper
Fund. Collectors will frequent or lurk
about the precincts of the theatres and beg
coppers from the amusement-seekers. It is
hoped and trusted that the latter will be
ashamed to refuse, under the peculiar cir-
cumstances, and that a large sum will
thereby be garnered in. Of course if the
crowd insists on giving silver, or even gold
coins or notes, there will be no objections
from the B.D.C. organisers. The first shot
was fired into the Allen Doone crowd at the
Princess’s, and the devastation was awful.
The bombardment will continue for some
weeks.
The Bridges family will await the Major-
General’s return from the wars in a Toorakian
villa. The girls, who aim at being not
merely Beautiful, but Good and Useful to
boot, go daily to the Town Hall and help to
reduce mounds of wool and woollens into
garments for the boys who are going to
travel in the battle line of business.
Ned Steven, the only child of his parents,
is off to the cannon’s mouth, where the
bubble reputation has its dwelling. He is
a versatile youth, who can draw, write and
do half a hundred other things. I shouldn’t
be surprised to learn that he knits and is a
domino champion. Ilis originality is aston-
ishing. Take his whiskers. Not even his
dearest pals can bet with certainty on his
wearing, a month from any given date., a
moustache, a beard, Dundrearies, an im-
perial, or a clean shave. The Girl He
Leaves Behind Him, Edie Lockley, is tiny
enough to fit into the young giant’s knap-
sack.
Last week the Austral Salon, which adores
lions, caught Melba, and the triumphant joy
of the huntresses was a pleasure to witness.
They absolutely gloated. The occasion was
a concert-tea or eafe-cliantant, or voice-trial-
cum-refreshments, and the Salon was filled
to the muzzle. Walter Kirby, who was to
sing, arrived with miraculous punctuality,
and was heard bleating down the aisle, “Has
the Deeva come yet?” As a matter of fact,
she hadn’t, and for a brief minute or two
Walter bore a pitiful resemblance to an
alien enemy who lias had his hank account
garnisheed, lhs agitation and mental stress
were terrific. During the afternoon the fol-
lowing paraded their art before Melba:
Gertrude Johnson. Wynne Maeoboy, Joy
Phillips, Natalie Dawson. Violet Parkinson
and the Magpie Orchestra (this last is blessed
by vice-regal peltings and patronage.) The
Personage herself was clad in a spring-like
way in a garment of apple green. She had
been lunching with the Munro Fergusons at
Government House, which accounted, possi-
bly, for her almost unnatural punctuality. 1
am assured that the parritch is on the Munro
Ferguson breakfast-table on the stroke ot
eight ilka morning, aiblins the immigrant
fuitmen, my fegs—but here am I drifting ott
into the Scottish tongue. As I was saying,
Melba was led with much gush up
the narrow Salon stairs and loaded with
flowers and praise and other superfluities.
Mrs. Charlie Mitchell followed, wrapped in a
black-and-gold motor wrap; also a young
girl, to me unknown, who showed a fine back
view and a pretty neck-nape under her tip-
tilted liat.
Sassiet.v is muttering darkly: “What ot
Laura WTnter-Irving’s wonderful Yon-Some-
thing German matrimonial catch now?
The general idea is that the fair Melbourne
girl ought to have seen the international row
coming, and, with a species of anticipatory
patriotism, turned her Teuton admirer down.
But the Blind God was ever a poor seer.
An interesting member of the Science
crowd is one Luigi. As to whether that is
his first or last name I am in doubt, my
Italian having been neglected in infancy, and
treated like a dog in later life. Suffice to say
that he answers to “Luigi” as another man
might to “Bill.” His face, though good and
kind, affords a peerless subject for carica-
ture. The features more resemble mountain
scenery than the component parts of a face.
The chin, nose and forehead stand out at
sharp angles, like half-bricks flung carelessly
on to a footpath, and a pair of fierce mous-
taches lend dignity to the whole. The
possessor of these endearing charms is. the
world’s expert in designing fortifications,
lie is the kind of man who is. allowed to ring
up for a warship or a special escort of
cavalry for his personal use in the same way
that an ordinary citizen might order a taxi
or the attendance of a policeman.
The seeing-off of the Scientists was a
notable social event. They left Spencer-
street in a special train, and the amount of
brain, home-grown and imported, on the
platform was a thing to marvel at. Gover-
nor Stanley and his lady (she looking much
better, though still a little thin and pale)
personally farewelled their guests, Sir ('has.
Lucas and Sir Bverard im Thurn, on the
platform. Archibald Strong. Prof. Sugden.
ex-Premier Fisher and loads of excitable
sciency souls waved miserably and trod on
the toes of the porters as the train moved
out. The scientific brigade has made itself
popular. Most of the members seem almost
human. Few look really wild, except one
old dear who sciences in a mustard-colored
Norfolk jacket with the belt trailing behind
him like a tow-rope, an old canvas fishing
bag slung over his shoulder, and a good
month’s growth of wispy hair. He’s what
I should call the real genuine article, worth
bolting your food to say good-bye to.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
On Saturday the A.R.C. Grand National Meeting-
opened at Victoria Park under the watchful eye of
the Governor. Also present were Mrs. Alan McFar-
lane and her daughter, Mrs. Sydney Rvmill, Mrs. Allan
Bowman —but you know the list of old. The most
horrible thing about the meeting was the weather.
As a matter of fact, the weather is causing nearly
as much hostile comment, just now, as the war. It
hasn’t rained for about 11 years, and from Monday
onwards anyone who waters a garden, or has a bath
in anything but a small basin, will be fined £5.
The S.A. Ladies’ Rowing Association held its first
annual meeting t’other evening with a mere man,
Mi*. A. E. Broadbent, in the chair. It seems to be
booming in a calm, unemotional sort of way, and
on most afternoons you can see a feminine crew seri-
ously practising on the Torrens.
The Wattle Day League held a “rally” on Satur-
day evening. W. J. Sowden did most of the rallying,
and, under the excitation of his remarks, it was
decided to celebrate the Day on the 29th in an
unprecedentedly elaborate manner.
The “Tuesday Club” met this week (Mrs. Free-
bairn, one of the vice-presidents, in the chair), and
discussed “Modern Dress.” One member said that
she had seen more immodesty of dress in one morn-
ing in Rundle-street than she had ever noticed in
London or Paris. Rundle-street has enjoyed a curi-
ous vogue ever since, but I have not heard of anyone
being satisfactorily shocked. What a collection of dis-
appointments Life is!
Over six hundred children took part in the Chil-
dren’s Fancy Dress Ball in aid of the Children’s
Hospital in the Exhibition Building on Wednesday
evening. The festivity is expected to show a profit
of £lOO or more.
Mr. Henry Dutton, who has been laid up since Sun-
day last at Anlaby, is no better. The H. H. Duttons
and their two children are still in England.
The H. P. Gills are due in Adelaide in the middle
of September, and Di*. Lendon and his daughter are
also hurrying back. Meanwhile, various European
trips that had been booked from this end have been
cancelled. Our “summer resorts,” where boarding-
houses have been springing to life like young rabbi s,
will gain what the Cold World loses.
Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Cave have gone for a trip to
Melbourne. Since the sale of their place at Second
Valley they have lived at Ruthven Mansions.
The first few minutes of “The Glad ibje,
at the Princess’s, were full of embarrass-
ment for Miss Alice Hamilton, the lady : n
green satin. Her first walk across the
stage was an astounding revelation of slit
skirt and glad limb. The cleft in the
raiment extended to the extreme height ot
last season’s fashion. The house laughed—
mostly. Then the lady sat down, and nobody
could see any cause for merriment or
amaze until she came across and got
a move on her. Another burst ot
rude hilarity followed, after which shouts ot
exclamation from the amphitheatre threatened
to interrupt the proceedings, until the vision
in green made her first exit. When she
reappeared her gown had been closed up
with a safety-pin, or stitched. The leg was
seen no more. But some of the subsequent
dressing suggested that “The (Had Bye” on
the stage was looking for sympathetic
responses from the male half of the audience.
Florence Rodway’s show of 40 portraits
and studies in pastel seems to be dragging
the right people up those Athenamm stairs.
Of the few pictures offered for sale the first
to go was No. 15, and then two or three
commissions were booked by the artist, who
has the alert Mr. Gill looking after business.
Her method of making the drawing in
oblique, wavy strokes gives one a first im-
pression of looking at the portraits through
tinted rain, but when all the 40 pastels have
been looked at, the sense of realism in the
faces —children, women and men —masters
the effect of monotony. The Rodwayian art
is most beautifully expressed, perhaps, in the
group of children —“The Intruder” (No.
40) and “The Green Fan” (15), but there
isn’t much to choose among 20 of the most
attractive subjects. “Hazel” (10) is _a
simple delight. The “Study in Grey” (15)
is startlingly effective from any viewpoint,
and this is for sale at a modest 15 guineas.
Some of the pictures that can be bought for
the price of three Paris hats need only a
more important frame to make them look as
valuable as a sealskin coat.
From “Rosna,” for the moment of Lon-
don :
The latest menace is the plush bowler for men.
These horrors are in all the art-shades of the rain-
bow, from pale blue to match the eyes of Clarence,
to a delicate blush pink to tone with the dimpled
cheeks of Algernon. No one has been seen in the
streets in these head coverings yet, but the outrage
may occur at any moment, and the multitude is
silently filling its pockets with stones, half-bricks and
similar protests.
“Gabby” Ray, who was divorced from Eric Coder
the other day, turns out to have abided with him
exactly 10 months out of the two years, or more, that
they were married. She is famous for her teeth
(which make her a favorite subject with our post-
card kings), for her diminutive size, and for her
frugal habits. She was granted her decree during a
morning session, which fairly resounded with well-
known names. Their owners included one of the
younger Sassoon matrons, Mrs. Crawshay-Williams
(whose M.P. husband found an affinity in the wife
of a fellow M.P. last year), Mrs. Dudley Ward (who
was Maidie Hope, another footlights beauty), Julia,
Lady Affeck, and the wife of Colonel Swire. All the
petitions were granted with Costs. It was a heavenly
time for Costg,
Yours sincerely.
JOHANNA.
H. Y. Braddon, ex-chairman Chamber of
Commerce, who has been Sydney manager
of Dalgety, Limited, lias been appointed
general inspector for Australasia in the
company’s interests. He is son of the late
Edward Braddon. of Australian finance
fame (author of “The Blot”). 11. Y. is an
Indian by birth and a nephew of Miss Brad-
don, whose novels were once the beloved of
the boudoir.
“Taieri”: “Tam” Duncan, Legislative
Councillor in Maoriland, and ex-Minister of
Lands in Seddon’s Cabinet, who crossed
over to join his old chief in Gabriel’s chorus
t'other day, had the rugged honesty of the
Scotchman, but he was belated on the road
to preferment and never cut much ice as a
Minister. When Seddon passed in his
cheques and lon Ward was called to the helm,
he dropped Duncan in readjusting his
Cabinet furniture. The old man was
beaten by Lee, an Oamaru barrister, at the
next elections. After that the Upper House
swallowed him.
At this time of strife and boil-over people
begin to remember a notable Federal Tory
politician who once held a job in a Federal
Tory Cabinet —Clemons, of Tasmania. Old-
man Clemons hated the idea of Clemons,
junior, mixing in compulsory service with the
sons of the common Australian democrat; so
he represented that his sons were unfit for
service. The Commonwealth area officer
subjected the youths to the medical officer,
and that functionary, having certified their
fitness for drill, they were ordered to the
ranks. Then Clemons decided to help his
sons to escape a citizen’s duties by sending
them to be educated or mentally disabled in
England. What bad Australians are these
great Imperialists and flag-flappers!
When this issue went to press the nations at
war included the British Empire (which, of
course, implies Australia, Maoriland, South
Africa, Canada, Newfoundland and many
other places) ; the Russian Empire (includ-
ing {Siberia, Turkestan, etc.) ; the German
Empire (with all its colonies) ; Belgium
(including the Congo State) ; Fiance (which
embodies New Caledonia, Algiers, Tunis,
Sahara right down to Tiinbuctoo, French
Guiana and some other items) : Austria,
Servia, Montenegro; and Japan (Japan
covers also Formosa and Korea). It
is difficult to realise that, in a legal and
technical sense, Parramatta and Timbuctoo
and Smtzbergen and the Falkland Islands
arc fighting shoulder, to shoulder with their
friends of Ghent against Bosnia, but the
fact holds good. War makes us acquainted
with remote bedfellows.

“0.5.8.” : The Pope who died last week was
not a great man. lie was not even a clever
one. lie was too pious and sincere to do his
Church much service in a worldly sense.
As a matter of fact, his uncompromising atti-
tude in various higjdy contentious respects
drove thousands of practising Catholics into
a sort of irritated indrfferentism. Take his
pronouncement on mix< d marriages. Assum-
ing that the Protestant party to the pro-
posed contract was a person of ordinary self-
respect,'the Catholic was''given the option of
abandoning the marriage or the Church.
Frail human nature is such t\iat it was the
Church that usually got the bird. France
would never have been lost to Rome under
a more pliant Pope—say, a Leo XIII. But
Pitrs X. could not appreciate- - the advisa-
bility of putting up with a little evil in order
to ensure a great deal of good. In the
essentials, of course, France is as strongly
Catholic as Belgium or Italy or Austria.
The Protestants of the Augsburg Confession
amount to a mere handful. The agnostics or
atheists, who represent the vast majority of
non-Catholics, are mostly earnest Republi-
cans of the well-to-do middle-classes, whose
anti-clericalism is largely a class- and politi-
cal-protest against the Royalist section. Had
Pius X. possessed the smallest trace of the
Vicar of Bray quality in his intellectual
make-up, had he known how to bargain,
and, where necessary, to yield, the Church,
would have been richer by as much as is
represented in the official spiritual control
of France. The dead pontiff has been an
asset to Rome chiefly as an exemplar. Ilis
simple holiness and benevolence silenced the
bitterest anti-clericalist wit from the time
when his personality became familiar to
Europe. He was the nearest thing possible
to the world’s conception of a saint, and it
is a tremendous advantage for a modern
church to have one who is suspected of being
a saint at the head of affairs for a decade.
N.S.W. Premier Holman has got his State
Parliament to vote £lOOO for Belgium.
There is nothing wrong with the principle;
for Belgium is, to all intents and purposes,
ruined. Unfortunately, to vote £lOOO to this
erstwhile prosperous little kingdom is, in the
present circumstances, very like offering a
man who has had a £lO,OOO house totally
destroyed, twopence-ha’penny as a means of
pulling himself together. It will be years
before the factories and works about Liege,
and in the Walloon country, get going again,
to make no mention of the standing crops
that have been destroyed wholesale. Bel-
gian industrialism is mostly confined to the.
devastated area. Bruges and Ghent, and
the other Flemish towns of the West, have
been dead for 300 years. Antwerp is a
great port when it is open, but it is the port
of the Rhine, and therefore German, not
Belgian ; and, when the war is over, Rotter-
dam will serve the Rhineland as well as, or
better than, Antwerp as a port. The
British and French Governments are reported
to be pouring £10,000,000 apiece into the
empty Belgian coffers, but even those vast
sums will be tragically inadequate. In
brief, they are merely to meet the indemnity
demanded by the destroyer.
Died at Melbourne, last week, Wolfe Fink,
a remarkable man of a remarkable family.
One brother was 8.J., who could finance a
bank on a desert island and in most other
places. Theodore made a big mark in
politics and as a reformer of education, and
would have been a greater political success
but for the Fink humor —a sense of humor
being the one thing the public never forgives,
unless it be humor of the red nose and slap-
stick variety. Another brother is Mark
Wilmot Fink, an incurable optimist, who
has been within cooee of more fortunes than
many other men in Australia, and who is
still a boy for all his gout. Wolfe was a
barrister, but wrote a great deal for Mel-
bourne Herald —which has no politics—so
that on public questions the Herald’s atti-
tude was W.F.’s, one of quiet, good-tempered
satire. Wolfe Fink was a very lovable man.
with a persistently youthful quality like
that of his brothers —the quality that belongs
to ability, for only the dull people grow up.
He died a bald boy of 62, with that good,
quiet smile on his face and the sure and cer-
tain hope that he would get up early and
walk to the foot of the rainbow —to-morrow.
There were many rainbows in the Fink
family.

IF BILIOUS OR CONSTIPATED TAKE
“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless “fruit” laxativ cleanses
stomach, liyer and bowels without
griping or discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its work.
“California Syrup of Figs” is a deliciously
refreshing fruit laxative which is always in
season. You can keep it at hand, and it
will be an unfailing friend whenever the
tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, as safely
as you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of “California Syrup
of Figs.” Directions are with it for adults
and children of all ages. This pleasant
laxative is good for all, and cannot possibly
harm even the most delicate, but you must
ask for “California Syrup of Figs,” and look
for the name and trade mark of the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. All leading chemists
sell “California Syrup of Figs.” 1/li and
1/9 per bottle.

ABORIGINA-
ALITIES
“The Cold Land”: Evening Echo
reports the discovery, at Derrinallum (Vic.), of a
number of native wells, some of them from Bft. to
13ft. in depth. In the peaty mass, caused by the
rotting reeds of centuries, were a great number and
variety of native weapons. In the bottom of one
well was found a broken cocoanut-drinking vessel.
Whether the eocoanut was taken there by one of the
early white explorers or was the property of the
abos. is not known. Professor Spencer, who will
probably make a visit JoThe find, may give a decision.
* ' <» - * *
“Gquger”: One Gf ! the best-known resi-
dents in.Townsville for many years was an immoral
old billygoat. On a thirsty day the goat would
make the round of the pubs, following parched men
in as they breasted the bar for a drink. Should the
men be strangers, and fail to. notice the patiently-
waiting goat, the heast would retire to the door,
measure his distance, charge, and with unerring
aim butt a man who was just downing a long beer
exactly on the handiest place.
The publican would then
explain matters, and the
injured party', after feeling
his • rattled bones, would
invariably “shout.” %So fre-
quently did this happen that
it pains me to say the goat
was, four days out of seven,
hopelessly inebriated. The
other three days he spent in
sleeping off the effects. A
totally different breed of
goat once roamed the streets
in White Cliffs (N.S.W.).
He had an absolute loathing
for a drunken man. Should
the unfortunate recipient of
this hatred he lying para-
lytic the; goat would again
and again butt him in his
helplessness and elsewhere.
I have seen maudlin drunks
blubbering pitifully on the
neck of a policeman, and
asking him to save them
from the teetotal and
Rechabite goat. At last,
however, the animal met the
wrong end of Waterloo. His
last victim came out of. hos-
pital quite sober, and,
catching the Rechabite alone,
tied a plug of gelignite to
his horns with a short fuse
attached. Then there was a
crash, and the heavens were
rent asunder, and the town
blew apart, and
went up, and later on
things began to come downy and there was a steady
drizzle of broken goat.,for three days.
“Nomad”; I’m at Alice Springs, and we
have only just got of May 28, so I
could not tell you sooner why a bull objects to the
color of Daisy Jerome’s hair. I’ve never seen Daisy’s
hair, but presume it is auburn if you’re affable, or
red if you’re a plain brute. A bull objects to this
color because it is the color of blood. I work
amongst cattle, and that’s how i think I know. I
was drawing water on a cattle station 16 miles east
of Charlotte Waters a while ago, and a calf came
into the troughs to drink and go on the burst. He
had been badly mauled by wild dogs, and blood was
all over him. The troughs were pretty crowded (it
was a hot, dry time), and as soon as the crush
sighted him they started to bellow like mad, and
then charged him in a body. He cleared out towards
the sand ridges (about 100yds. on either side of the
well, which was on a box flat) and that was the last
of him. He never came back. They went mad and
settled him. I’ve heard that most animals act simi-
larly.
“N. or M.”: A young 18ft. bottle nose
whale, with a complexion like a patent-leather boot,
has shipwrecked on the mud-flats of Ralph’s Bay
(Tas.), where the canal is to be. The purblind
brute blundered in after a shoal of fish and was left
stranded by the tide, after the manner of his kind.
The finishing touch was supplied by a Chow, who
went down ; from Hobart for the gall, to “make
medicine.” It is a wonder there are any whales left
to collide with 20th-century beaches; but Norwegian
whalers (whalers are mostly Norwegians now) say
that “fish” are more plentiful than ever, in spite
of indiscriminate killing. That, by the way, is going
to make trouble later. What prevents the industry
booming is the low price of oil. Whaling was
whaling when towns were lit with sperm lamps, as
Hobart was within the memory of old inhabitants.
All the old shipowners who struck oil when oil was
worth striking—Kelly, Sea], Crowther, McGregor
and the rest—are gone now ; nevertheless, among the
long-lived cetaceans, whalers stil come across signs
of old times. It is only three or four years since
a whale killed off “the Cape” was found to be
carrying one of D. Crowther’s harpoons. I can't
say how long ago the casualty occurred, but
Crowther came to Tassy in ’24, so the bit of iron is
fairly ancient.

“Winter”: They lay in beauty side by
side, Bill and his room-mate, Jones. .Tones had the
toothache. Sleep he couldn’t. He bore it for a
long while in silence; then there was a long, low
moan. Bill woke. “What’s up ?” he asked. “Oh,
I,got a tooth giving me rats.” “Go to sleep,” said
Bill. “Can’t,” said Jones. “Try counting sheep
jumping over a fence,” advised Bill. “That send
you to sleep?” asked Jones. “Yes, you’ll be'cff
in no time,” answered Bill, and turned over. The
carts were rumbling along to the creamery. “Bill,”
said Jones. Bill opened his eyes and yawned.
“What’s up?” he asked. “Say, Bill, what do you
call it after you get to nine hundred and ninety-
nine billions?”

THE SAVAGE.
They live the exceedingly simple life. They go about stark naked—men, women and children alike.
They know nothing about dress. —Swedish scientist Mjobery on North Australian aborigines.
MRS. SUBBURS: “I see the North Australian blacks know nothing about dress."
MR. SUBBURS (sighing): “Ah, welt, I suppose we’ve got some advantages, after all.
With us dress may cost a lot, but it at least covers you.”
“Terefa”: Biughi round Arnheim Bay
trusts a white man about as much as he would a
black snake, lie seems to think that a white man’s
one delight is shooting nigs and stealing Mrs. Nig.
This idea has been put into his head by the Macassars
and Malays, who, until recent years, were trepanging
round the coast. A strange nig. coming to the
camp with trade is ready to break at any moment.

“Wiorubi”: “Machete” (B. 11/6/’l4)
writes of a “bore” or tidal wave in the Fly River,
Papua, as being 9ft. or 10ft. in height. In no
Papuan river is the bore at any season of the year
higher than sft. The Turama River has the highest,
closely followed by the Bariiu River. That in the
Fly River has never more than an altitude of 18in.
at any point, and then it is only to be met with
at spring tides at a fixed period of the year. The
writer spent 589 days and nights on the waters of
the Fly, and many weeks on the other Gulf of
Papua rivers, and found that, while the bores are
dangerous, they are not anything like the formid-
able affairs many writers try to make out. I
remember on One trip to the Bamu River, some
years ago, I struck the bore at a point where it
comes up the river and a second wave meets the
first one round the top end of an island. The
tumult was tremendous, yet even at this point the
wave did not exceed 4ft. at its highest.

If the Backbloeks ever change the bit of
religion they’ve got they will turn into cloud-
worshippers. Out in the Far West and Sou’-West

nearly two years. In the past eight months there
has been less than 3in., and in 20 months only 7|in.
fell. And it fell in such thin wisps of moisture
that it was of no account. The crows had two-
thirds of this year’s lambs almost as soon as they
were born, and a whole lot of mothers died before
they could earn the bonus; also of those that are
left, a Lower-Darling squattage reported the other
day, many are too poor and weak to stand the
racket of mustering and shearing. Yet on the very
day when this dreary story dropped in on top of a
pile of other cheerless news the Victorian Govern-
ment Statist sent out his report of the things done
by one small patch right in the heart of the drought-
stricken wilderness. This place, Mildura, no better
and no worse than millions of acres of country which
couldn't at present fatten one rabbit to the' mile,
happens to have water pumped on to it out of the
Murray; and from only 134 square miles of it 1980
tons of raisins and 3858 tons of sultanas and 2581
tons of currants have just been made from the
past year’s crop of 29,600 tons of grapes. Still, there
are quite a lot of people who talk about “private
rights,” and demand that the precious moisture
shouldn’t be poured out on the sand, but should be
allowed to trickle down so that a dozen or two wool
barges may have a clear run with their precarious
cargoes of dead Wool and sheep’s bones.
According to a story told by Perou, a
French naturalist who visited Sydney in 1802 with
Commodore Baudin’s scientific expedition, Australia
owes a lew millions to a prize taken in the wars
that soaked most of the early years of last century.
The majority of writers on the history of the wool
industry of Australia have asserted that the Spanish
sheep, brought from the Cape in the Reliance and
Supply in 1797, were the only muttons in stock for
many years. Peron, however, remarked:—-
With respect to the sheep of the Spanish breed,
which form the principal stock of the numer-
ous _ flocks of N.S.W., they proceed from a
considerable number of fine merinos which the
British Government has transmitted to Port
Jackson at different periods; and 30 rams of
the most beautiful kind, sent, by the Court of Spain
to the Viceroy of Peru during the last war, form a
part of this invaluable stock, they having been taken
by a British ship within sight of the port at which
they were to be landed.
If German William has a mob of pure Angoras that
he can spare, he is urgently requested to ship them
to his Papuan colony. Also, we could do with a
flock of pure-bred ostriches and a couple of pairs
of the C.O.D. fowl.

“Gus Gosh”: Mention of the Ivalgoorlie
(W.A.) woman who went to bed to escape arrest
for non-payment of debt (B. 6/8/'l4) reminds me
of another goldfields woman. This one and her
husband (a doctor) were a litigious pair, and
thorns under Authority’s fifth rib. The local
sergeant was sent to raid the house in connection
with a contempt of court or some such charge. When
he knocked at the front door the lady, who was
alone on the premises, cautiously applied her eye to
a peephole, and a glance showed her the brass
buttons of the Law. By the time the sergeant
had given his second knock the garrison was well
forward with its plan of defence. “You can’t coine
in,” she called excitedly. Thereupon the officer
thundered, “Open in the name of the Law,” or
words to that effect. All he got in reply was a
loud feminine screech: “Go away! I’m undressed!”
But duty was duty, and with typical police resource-
fulness he sneaked around to a window. llis loud
footsteps gave him away, and the lady was waiting
for him. Directly he laid a hand on the sash the
curtains were pulled aside and an expanse of bosom
glittered through the glass. The lady was rather
attractive, too : but the cop was a married man with
responsibilities at home, so he forced his eyes away
and set out for another window. Again he was
thwarted, and his blushes grew lurid. Then he got
angry. “Open the door, woman,” he shouted, “or
I’ll burst it in.” A shrill jeer answered him.
“Break it open,” he heard, “and you'll see me in
the passage with nothing on.” And as he was still a
married man with a wife at home lie gave it best
for that day—which wasn’t as bad as the experience
of Brown, the old-time Sydney bailiff, who went to
arrest Lola Montez just as the vessel was sailing
frem Miller’s Point and found that she had taken
the precaution to undress and go to bed. Brown
had to lose his quarry for good.

BOOZERS’ EXCUSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. Clarence Godfrey, medical officer of Lava Insti-
tute for Inebriates (Vic.), has been taking an in-
ventory of his patients. He finds that 394 ascribed
their melancholy failing to “sociability." The next-
biggest contingent (94) said heredity did it. The
smallest bunch (three) blamed “sudden prosperity.”
For very many reasons men
Are drinking whisky, wine and beer;
There was an honest period when
The cit. confessed, with nought of fear,
He drank the boose his thirst to quell
Because he liked good tipple well.
But nowadays dishonest Brown,
Who fills his tank with beer or stout,
Until the liquor gets him down,
And spiders tumble round about,
Insists the trait is one he had,
Perforce, from his lamented (iad.
Another party is content
To blame his appetite for beer
On a neurotic temperament.
Still oth.er men from whom we hear
Assert that business ..worries are
Impelling them' towards The bar.
But strangest of the lot is he
Who drains the swelling cask because
Of love of sociability.
jßlue devils come ; the jimjam claws ;
The,.d.t. imps. He greets the clan
Because he is a friendly map.
The Taptods' tumble on the floor,
Thgjgriffins scuttle up the wall,
And grinning goblins half a score
' Dance round responsive to his call.
He drinks for comp’ny day and night,
And gets the company all right!

“Tiaki”: There were many tricks played
on Henare in the “Rood old days,” in order to
divorce him from his land. Old Mao., one of the
wealthiest squatters in Hawkes Bay, coveted a certain
rich slice. After pondering the thing he sent home
to the land o’ burgoo for a number of gaudy rugs
and blankets. These he hung on his front fence.
One day Renata Topoi happened in casually. “Py
korry! Me hawa te tream ras’ night, Mao. Te
pi-i-g tream.” Silence. “What you dream, Renata?”
inquired Mac, disinterestedly. “Me tream you
guvum me some dem kahu on te fence,” replied
Topoi. “Oh, all right, Renata. You take what
you like. You the big chief.” “Py korry!” said
Renata, “now I know you te proper rangatira.
Kapai, kapai!” A month after, while Renata was
parading “the block” in the gaudiest blanket, he diet
Mac. “Tena koe, Renata,” said the Caledonian.
“By golly, I had the bi-i-g dream las’ night.”
“What you tream ?” asked Topoi. “Oh, I dream
you give me that land on Moumoukai” (indicating
a couple of sheep-farms with a wave of his hand).
“Oh, no good, no good,” grunted Renata. But
Mac knew the native custom. Renata having
accepted a gift, could not, according to “rangatira”
'code of honor, refuse the donor what he asked in
exchange; so Mac got the brace of sheep-farms and
Renata got the blankets and the had taste in his
mouth. Both parties are long since dead; but Mac’s
people still hold the sheep
country—or did quite
recently.
SLOTH AND FAILURE.

“Billy T.”: We were passing Hoban’s,
going out to Bingall’s lease, and we came upon a
woolly man, with a wild, unseeing eye, sitting on
top of a high gate-post. He had a long, slim prop
in his hands ; to the prop was attached a length of
line; to the line a fishhook large enough for alliga-
Jtors. He was fishing into the void. Every half-
minute he jerked up his prop, and took an imaginary
item from his hook, and put it in a bag hanging
from the side of the post. Sometimes the non-
existent object escaped from the bag, and got into
, the fisher’s whiskers. Then the man held the rod
his knees, while he fought with the visionary
creature, and restored it to the bag. “Jimjams?”
I said. “Yes,” said Scott. “Don’t you think it a
terrible thing?” I ventured. Scott did not seem dis-
tressed. “Oh, I dunno,” he said. “Hoban can afford
to keep ’em—he’s won a Tatt.’s.”
MISTAKEN.
M ISTRESS: “I thought I heard a man's voice in the kitchen.”
M AID: “No, indeed, mem—you teas mistook.”
“Pick”: I would caution “K. Cy” (B.
6/8/’l4) not to book too many beers about the
Chillagoe district (Q.) being the most metalliferous
spot on earth. In the sunken valley of the Shoal-
haven (N.S.W.), between Oallen and Talwong—a
"stretch of country, as the aero-crow flies, 15 miles
by four —in addition to nearly every one of the
minerals he mentions there have been unearthed
to my knowledge arsenopyrite, alum, hematite and
limonite, chromite, cobalt and gold. Also, the
region contains slate, limestone, blue and variegated
marble, chalcedony and at least two kinds of mineral
waters. Chillagoe, however, may keep the distinc-
tion of being a good grassland for horses. The
Shoalhaven flats are tipped sheer up on end, and the
only way the fossickers can feed their mokes thereon
is to hang them over the edge in their breechings.

“Moana”: Saw a bush carpenter cut a
sheet of glass into two pieces the other day, with-
out a diamond or any kind of cutting instrument.
First he got a big tub full of water and placed it
handy. Next he laid the sheet of glass on the table
and drove in two nails, one at each side of it, in
a line with where he desired to sever the trans-
parency. He put a teaspoonful of whisky into a
saucer and soaked a piece of worsted in it for a
few seconds. This worsted he squeezed fairly dry,
and then he stretched it tightly across the glass by
tying it to the nails. After a brief period of repose
he lighted a match. The stuff burned for some
time, and when the worsted broke the carpenter
quickly seized the sheet, plunged it deep into the
water, and, with a quick snap, broke it cleanly
along the desired line. After that he drank the
remains of the whisky.
“Y.Z.” : I have made a discovery. For years
we have had from the fatted press persistent sermons
on the working-man’s shocking contempt for his job.
The alacrity with which he downs tools on the tick
of knock-off time has been a theme for passionate
homilies and a subject for club-footed humor. The
worker’s lack of honest pride in his task that impels
him to give what he is paid for and no more has
wrung scalding tears from the virtuous press and his
pastors and temporal masters. It has been my mis-
fortune to have to deal much with contractors and
large and medium employers lately, and my flabber-
gasting discovery is this —the boss has even less
respect for his task than the workman has. He is
more prompt and decisive in knocking off. He is
punctiliously assiduous in giving not one hair more
than has been bargained f..r. If he has contracted
with you to build a house, he will leave it in an
uninhabitable state if the contract has not specified
every detail. No honest pride in his work will
induce him to drive a single nail or lay one brick
that isn't in the bond. If you are buying furniture
the boss will ring in shoddy wherever shoddy can be
hidden. How comes it, I ask you, that the mechanic
is condemned and derided for having lost pride and
joy in his craft, while the boss, who is equally a
loathly and comic object, escapes without a gibe?
“Sundown Jack”: A football team from
Npmurkah (Vic.) t'other day went to play the black
boys at Curramagunya Mission. The game was fast
from the word go. By half-time the pale-faces, were
all out, but the darkies kept the pace going. At
three-quarter time Numurkah could hardly crawl, but
the mission team was as frisky as ever. Final scores:
Currama (etc.), 35 ; Numurkah —don’t talk about it.
It wasn’t till next day that Numurkah took a tumble.
They had played four teams instead of one—a fresh
team each quarter. The dusky ones were all so
dusky and so much alike to unskilled ej'es that no
one noticed the changes and differences.
COUSIN JACK RELATIONSHIPS.
CAP'N: “Art thee a son to John ’Ockin’ wot
used to sing in choir ’ome Redruth?”
BILLY: “Iss, Cap'n.”

father for ’ears and ’ears.”
.I e 1 anti . \V as over the entrance to
the Diving Cave at Vavua (Friendly IslJs) the other
day. Marnner, in his “Tonga,” published earlv lad
century, mentions the hole. Stock, in one of lis
Island yarns, makes use of the place as a retreat for
his dusky, heroine. The entrance to. the cave is.about
6ft. under the surface at low water, and clearlv lis
cernible from a boat. The natives are at
diving in through the narrow channel, but few white
men care to tackle the proposition. The last one I
heard of (a young naval lieutenant from a survev
snip) hit his head on the reef and gave up the
ghost. 1
“Eddyson” : “The disate iv the wnmin !"
said Flynn. “’Tis borrn t’ them, ’n’ never a taste
iv schoolin’ do they nade in shlyness ’n’ diception at
all. There was Annie Slathery, f’r instance, brought
up ’n’ educate here in Bungaree, ’n’ she a thritle iv
a Bhma.ll girrl wid gowlden hair ’n’ big, tinder eyes
full wid wonder ’n’ misundtherstandin’ iv the world
’n’ men ’n’ the ways iv tin 1 same. 'Twas Annie tuck
lit in her head Providence intended she would marry
wid Mick Hannan, him bein’ six feet ’n’ a fine man
t’ boot. So ut happened be accident V premedita-
tion the two ldm together a great deal. Would
Mick go abroad at all there was Annie Slathery
gatherin' thrifts iv flowers be the way. Did Mick
pay a neighborly call for a mile round, ‘twas Annie
would be visitin’ the same place, to her great V
endurin’ surprise. Annie cud meet Mick tin times
a day, ’n’ be sthruek wid amazement at the strange
adventure ev’ry time. The pair had got maybe I'
the stage where a man would sit be a girrl, ’n’ have
a holt iv her hand an hour be the clock, whin Mick
was called away to a stiddy job in Milbourne. He
held Annie be the hand wan hour longer,' V then
wint off widout it seemin’ necessary to him t’ dwell
on future arrangemints ’iv’ developmints. There's
silence fer a fortnit, whin a letter arrives be post,
gayin’ Mick is in his billet, ’n’ Milbourne's a grreat
place, ’n’ the weather’s fine t’ middlin’. Miss
Slathery composes a dockymint which intimates that
the pitatee crop is promisin’ better than symptims
might iv led wan to expect. She sez da’s leg is not
as shwelled ’as it was; ’n’ ma’s gettin’ over her
pleurisy, but there’s a sort iv diprission in the atmo-
sphere; ’n’ the place ain’t what it wanst was. She
concludes wid a casual remarrk that what’s ailin’
her is probably a matther iv slnnall consequince t’
be shook off in a wake —a touch of consumption,
maybe, no more. Mick replies wid some talk iv
Bourke-shtreet, ’n’ the moon risin’ over the Yarra.
Annie gives an aftliernoon to ut, ’n’ infuses sadness
into four pages iv prattle, concludin’ wid the shtate-
mint he’ll know how will ’n’ happy she’s lookin’
alone in Bungaree, wid no one t’ care for a ha’porth,
be the iihotygraft inclosed. Now, ez a matther iv
fact, that photygraft is showing Annie most depressed,
wid a sad, far-away look to ut, ’n’ a thrifle iv hol-
lowness t’ the cheek, ’n’ a sort iv haste-t’-the-funeral
atmosphere generally. This inaugyrits a series iv in-
threstin’ shtudies iv Annie in var.vis stages iv de-
cline, aicli more pale ’n’ haggard than the wan pre-
cedin’—Annie’s brother havin’ tuck to phptygraphv—
’n’ aicli wid a lether writ shpritelv, but wid a cer-
tain ondefinable sadness. Manewhile Mick is writin’
no more iv scenery ’n’ life ’n’ the methropolis, but is
askin’ what Annie is takin’ for her complaint, ’n’
Bondin’ remidies fer wastin’ disase ’n’ lung throuble,
till presently comes a letter which sez Annie is feel-
in’ that, afther all, ’tis p’r’aps best wan is not long
fer this worrld —‘see inclosed.’ Inclosed is a por-
trait iv herself that haggard ’n’ depressed yid think
her. burvin’ was Chewsdee noon. Mick trows down
all immejit affairs, ’n’ goes for home. ‘The poor
girrl’s dyin’ fer the love iv me,’ sez he, ‘V I’ll niver
permit the same,’ he sez. He sits ’n’ looks at the
photygraft all the way t’ Egerton, ’n’ there’s wan
tear on his nose tip ’n’ annother chasin’ it ivry min-
ute iv that time. Mick comes sthrait at Annie where
she’s sittin’ in the garrdin, thrimmin’ herself a hat,
’n’ she ez rosy ’n’ ez plump as anny well-fed girl in
the six States. The facts iv the case is plain. Miss
Slathery have docthored her face up wid stage
thricks t’ look worried ’n’ wobegone ’n’ depressed,
wid delibrit intintion t’ disave. Mick looks at the
photygraft. Mick looks at Miss Slathery. ‘Annie!’
sez he, ‘what's happened yeh, ve’re so well agin all iv
a suddint ?’ Then that shmall, innocent, oneducated
girrl, cot all onexpectit, looks at him wid her grreat,
wonderin’ eyes, ’n’ sez she: ‘Mickle, darrlin,’ she
sez, ‘the voice iv the shyiirit in me was saying “He’s
cornin’ back !” ’n’ hasn't me hearrt been glad these
two days, so it seemed the Lord might wish me t’
live, afther all!’ *’N’ what happened?’ sez you.
What else? He tuck her in his big; sthrong arums,
’n’ he sliwore he’d never lave her annother day t’
pine ’n’ die, ’n’ they had a most cni.vable weddin’
within the month. Which is the right ’n’ proper’
indin’ to all love schemes, honest or treacherous ’n’
invidyiss, I’m thinkin’.”

“Alrich”: I would like to know the in-
gredients of a particular brand of snake-juice that
the .Taps have popularised in the pearling industry
at. Broome ( W. A.) and elsewhere on the west
coast. It is known as “corpse reviver,’’ and by the
beard and feet of the prophet's grandmother, the
name is no misnomer. On several occasions I have
seen apparently asphyxiated Malay and Jap. divers
brought back from the banks of the Styx in a sur-
prisingly short time after the administration of the
dope. In fact, the Japs, believe they can resusci-
tate any suffocated diver, provided they can get him
up before the pressure of blood breaks the bones in
his skull apart. It was tried on one occasion on a
white diver who was all but out There must have
been something wrong with the dope, or the method
of administration, because at the autopsy the doctor
couldn’t find the man’s stomach. What use is a man
when he has lost his stomach ?
“Ed.” : They tell you in the district of
McPhee, Bungaree, that Teddy Wheelan died and
was put in his coffin, and left on the parlor table,
waiting the coming of the hearse from Ballarat.
Foi an hour lie was alone, and when the sorrowing
widow went in to him, wondering had he any wants,
or need of a candle maybe, she found Teddy sitting
up in his coffin, smoking the old colored pipe they d
lefr by as a comfort and consolation to deceased.
And Teddy took his pipe from his mouth, and said
lie: “’Tis a qua re bathtub .viv give me, Mary Whelan,
Cod forgive yeh ; but if it is a bath yer moanin’, I’ll
have water wid if n’ thank you kindly.” In corrobo-
ration I can prove that Teddy Wheelan is still alive

ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A number of gentlemen of a wowserish east of
whiskers are repudiating football’s claim to be
considered a desirable sport on the ground that it
only tempts the masses to further indolence, since
where 36 men play 25,000 are content to look on.
The players were upon the green ;
The classes filled the lofty stand ;
The humbler kind of folk were seen j
In barracking, benighted bands,
With trifling brickbats in their hands;
The busy umpire ran about.
The “Magpies” piled a noble score.
With frightful oaths the vulgar rout
Expressed the hatred that they bore,
And hinted at a taste for gore.
There came a burst of thunder sound,
The mighty crowd was all aflame 1
Twelve thousand strong it rushed the ground,
With sticks and stones, its simple aim
To give ni?.v color to the game.
They chased the players to and fro ;
They belted them most grievously ;
They maimed a fat John Hop or so ;
They made a turmoil grand to see,
And chased the umpire up a tree.
They tore the tents ar.d fences down,
They did the cat'rer for his beer;
In vans were carried back to town
The stricken players, tier on tier.
Now, wowsers, be of better cheer—
Your words are not without avail,
The people hear and mark the same!
They doff their sloth, and in they sail
To wipe right out your cause for blame,
By taking some part in the game!
VICTORIA.

“T. 0.1.”: A widow of Ulladulla (N.S.W.)
applied lately for a new hotel license at
that place. Having quoted section 24 of
the Liquor Act, which provides that the
calling of the applicant must be stated in
the application, the sub-inspector raised the
point that “widow” was not a calling. On
a previous application he had successfully
raised another technical objection, and the
Bench upheld this one, too. In spite of the
fact that in innumerable legal documents
females are designated “spinsters,” “married
women” and “widows,” these may not be
“occupations” or “callings.” But -where is
the sense of these technicalities? The pub
is needed or it is not needed. If it isn’t
needed why not say so openly? If it is,
why block it with technical objections?
They mean waste; and the sooner we drop
to the fact that we cannot afford to waste
anything the better.

The Salv’army has had the fight of its
raucous life. A Liverpool lady left it
£33,800. A couple of near female relatives
contested the bequest on the ground that
the Salv’army was more of a trading
concern' than a charitable organisation.
Their lawyer had no difficulty in proving
that the Army carried on huge wholesale
and retail stores, a bank, an insurance office,
a benefit society, many newspapers, a tourist
agency and various other peezness concerns.
Also it was proved that the late General
Booth claimed and exercised “absolute
power” in dealing with the funds, and that
he drew no fine distinctions between the
charitable and the trading activities. The
Judge thought hard, but finally gave the
Army the benefit of the doubt and decided
that the Liverpool crank’s gift “was a good
charitable bequest.” Still the Army may
not have such remarkable luck next time.

“Tiaki”: The advertising shark doesn’t
miss much. The boomlet which the alleged
Maori “king” lately enjoyed when he went
to London to talk to the other sovereign
about his “wrongs” gave one crowd the
chance to advertise “Maori cigarettes” as
the one sure cure for asthma. As a matter
of fact Henare and Meri have no special
“shigarette” ; they make none of their own.
and suck at any old imported thing, mostly
lighting the summit of one at the base of the
other. And as for asthma, they are no freer
of it than the Dead Sea is of the unsatis-
factory substance that Lot found his missus
was made of.

“T. 0.1.”: The Saturday Half-Holiday
Association was started in Sydney in 186!).
Soon afterwards it published a list of the
shops which closed at one o’clock on Satur-
days. The three big drapers of that period
headed the list —David Jones & Co., Farmer,
Painter and Pope, and Thompson and Giles.
Among the 35 names on the list were six
jewellers, four tailors, nearly all the iron-
mongers and ship-chandlers, two music-sell-
ers, two saddlers and various fancy-goods
dealers. Of the 35, David Jones and Farmer’s,
three of the jewellers (Flavelle, Hardy Bros,
and T. T. Jones), two of the tailors, both
of the saddlers, the two music men, and
most of the ironmongers still flourish.

Engineers are pointing out just now that
the Great Eastern, built of wood in 1858,
was safer than most modern steamers.
Brunei, her builder (one of the most versa-
tile engineers the world has ever known),
planned to build a - perfectly safe ship, and
lie succeeded so well that the Great Eastern
survived acquaintance with a submerged
rock that tore a hole 80ft. long by 10ft. wide
in the outer skin. It had an inner skin,
carried up to a point well above the water-
line—a hull within a hull, with a space of
about 3ft. between. In case a blow should
rupture both skins he subdivided the vessel
into no less than 51 separate compartments,
with strong bulkheads between them, reach-
ing to the top deck. The ship proved costly
to run and was a financial failure, but that
was because it was ahead of its time. There
wasn’t sufficient business then to keep the
monster buzzing.

The first “private bar” in a Sydney hotel
was established in 1850 by Edward Samuell
at the Liverpool Arms, on the sou’-west
corner of Pitt and King streets. lie .adver-
tised that “a great complaint has long been
made in Sydney that there was no room in
which gentlemen, after the business of the
day, could enjoy their otium cum dl unit ate
without fear of being incommoded by the
smallness of the apartment, or the number
of its occupants.” With a view to remedy-
ing this “crying evil” Mr. Samuell had been
“induced at great expense to build and fit
up for the use of his numerous patrons a
room which he was proud to say had been
pronounced by all who had done him the
honor of visiting it as the most spacious,
elegant and complete thing of the sort in
the • colony.” Mr. Samuell based his claim
to the patronage of the gentlemen of Sydney
upon three points, in each of which lie
maintained that no other house could in
the slightest degree compare with his—viz..
(1) that the room was matchless as regarded
comfort, elegance and convenience; (2)
that the liquors supplied were of the most
varied, recherche and superb description;
and (3) that among its frequenters would be
found the elite of the gentry of Sydney.
“Y.” : In some things law had more sense
in early Sydney than it has in the city of
to-day. Instance the auctioneers who roar
in their marts in most of the crowded streets
forenoon and afternoon. Their jewellery is
often brummagem, falsely-stamped; their
“unredeemed pledges” are often faked; and
the “sales” they make are confidence tricks
and swindles. Yet the police are practically
powerless. They must wait for a victim to
complain. In 1828 the infant N.S.W. placed
an Act on the statute-book ordering that at
the close of each day’s sale every auctioneer
must submit his books to the law, and pay
over 14 per cent, of the total takings. The
revenue amounted to something; but more
valuable still was the chance which the Law
had of detecting fraud and imposition. It
was a hard, cold time for the “snide” sales-
man and his confederates who purchased
trinkets at 10 times their value merely to
encourage the mugs to bid up.
“Moana” : If you drop anything overboard
in mid-ocean and want to find it after many
days, the best place to go to is Mason’s Bay,
on the west coast of Stewart Island (M.L.).
This bay catches the tail-end of the main
drift current that sweeps in from the south-
west. If you hurl a bottle overboard in the
Indian Ocean it will probably end up at
Mason’s Bay. All kinds of things are finally
tossed up on the beach, including shrieks for
help from the imported dredge that never
arrived. There is a lonely settler there
named Adamson, who has a 2000-acre sheep
run. and in less than four years he has raked
in £3OO from the sale of ambergris found on
tlie beach. The other day he took to the
Bluff a piece of the stuff weighing 20oz. and
several small pieces that brought his find up
to 50oz. He says he couldn’t live on the
farm if the beach wasn’t thrown in. *
“Darley”: It does not appear to be as
generally known as it ought to be that pro-
ceedings for offences under the N.S.W.
Stamp Duties Act may be taken by any
“common informer.” (A person who merely
supplies information to the police upon
which proceedings are taken, but does not
himself file an information, is not deemed
to be an informer). A country butcher
gave a receipt for over £2 without attach-
ing the required duty stamp thereto, where-
upon the person who received the unstamped
receint laid an information for breach of
the Stamp Act. The magistrate, in impos-
ing the maximum fine of £lO with costs,
gave half the fine to the informer. ( I don’t
want to encourage the industry of “inform-
ing” ; I merely want to suggest that it is a
dangerous game to try to save the tuppence.
BULLETS AND BILLETS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Utterly Demented Feline Mine closed down
to-day. As :i result, 200 men have been thvown out
of employment. —Regular news item.
“Ev’ry bullet has its billet.’’
But this also irks my soul:
O’er each billet, now, the bullet
Hovers like a ton of coal.
Europe offers endless billets
To the men who care to fight—
But it also offers bullets
Which are not so pleasant quite.
Local workers may have bullets
Fired at them by German foe,
Or be fired from out their billets.
Which is worse, I do not know.
N.S.W.
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
LOVE SONGS OF TRADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Butcher sings:
O Love ! my heart for yours is sausage-meat,
And, like fresh tripe, I tremble as I hear
Your tiny trotters patter down the street;
No primest cut of fillet steak could beat
The tenderness that unto you I bear;
Without you, love, life were not worth a button,
But with you it were choice merino mutton.
The Grocer sings:
You are dearer, love, to me
Than the special brand of tea
I sell to swells at three-and-six a pound ;
And I ask no more of Fate
Than to have you as my mate
While I cart the weekly groceries around.
Oh, just wouldn’t it be grand,
You with sugar, I with sand,
To mix them so no customer could tell!
Be my own, my honey, do!
You will find my weight is true,
For without you, love, were Wages Boards and
Hell.
The Barman sings:
No shandy soul is this I offer thee,
But Three Star Special, bottled from the wood.
When first T sipped your lips and found them
good,
I knew they smacked of real old Barley Bree,
Redder than Red Chartreuse and choicer far
Than any brand that stands behind the bar!
So love me, gold-topped magnum, and be mine,
And get thee drunk with love instead of wine.
The Linendraper sings:
A Great Spring Exposition’s in my heart
When you, beloved, walk from squad to squad.
And when you take your leave, O Ichabod,
The profits flap their gold wings and depart!
Yet what care I? As dreary and as stale
As some poor Ten Per Cent. Reduction Sale,
That drags a whole month through and draws no
trade,
So is my life without you, lovely maid.
But share my soul—my shop, my laces, stays,
My ribbons—all are yours for all your days!
The Bottle-0 sings:
Ain’t she a bonzer, with ’er eyes as blue
As them there poison bottles use ?
An-’ carn’t she kid yer ! Wot’s a bloke ter do
W’en she jus’ says she wants a pair o' shoes?
Yer ’as ter get ’em somewhere, an’ yer does —
Nor she don’t arsk no questions if they’re ’ot.
(Pinched ’em? Of course! —’ow else could they
be got,
With ’orsefeed up an’ ’undreds at ther game,
So now yer takes orl day ter git a load !)
An’ when yer lobs ’em ’ome she’s down th’ road,
An’ fists yer silver so as yer won’t blow it!
She’s a shinin’ cobber, Liz is—an’ I know it.
The Baker sings:
I’ve known a batch of women in my life,
Some was too yeasty, others not enough;
Some good for fancy tarts, but not for wife ;
Others too ropey, more again too rough.
But Mary takes the biscuit and the cake;
Like pure malt extract is her hair deep brown,
Her skin is like the almond bread we bake
To dazzle by its whiteness. If she frown.
The yeast of life won’t work, and well I know
That all the cake I bake will just be dough,
But if she smile —well, Heaven must just be so!
The Pawnbroker sings:
Rebecca vos as lot'ely as pure gold,
She vos a diamond of the finest water.
Them lilies vat did Solomon behold
Vos not so fine as Isaac Cohen’s daughter.
Her hair vos black, her nose vos very long,
Her fingers vos just made for vearing rings,
And Isaac Cohen vos ten thousand strong
Mit shares in discount banks and other things.
But vot’s the good—Rebecca vos not mine!
She lof dat dirty scoundrel Guldenstein —
De dog! De cow! De low-down, lazy svine?

“My son had been attended by a legally qualified doctor,
who pronounced him to be suffering from Pneumonia and
Pleurisy. In spite of the doctor’s treatment the child gradually
got worse, and the doctor pronounced the case hopeless.
He told me that the child could not live. At this stage I
obtained HEARNE’S Bronchitis Cure, and gave it
to the child, according to the directions which accompany
each bottle. The child improved after the second dose.
He continued to improve each day from each dose of
HEARNE’S Medicine alone, and within three
days he was free from the Cough, Pneu-
monia and the Pleurisy. He was out
of bed at the end of a week, com-
pletely recovered.”

ANEMIA
and Weakness
in Men, Women, and Children
Dr. ANDREW WILSON writes :
“It can be definitely stated
“that Iron ‘Jelloids’ constitute
“ the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poor-
“ness of Blood. The sufferer is able
“to take Iron ‘Jelloids’ without danger,
“ even with pleasure, and with the sure
“knowledge that benefit will accrue.”
and re “ MEN AND TONICS.”
“ There is a curious notion entertained by
“ the General Public that Iron Medicaments
“ are necessary for women only, and not for
“Men. This is an erroneous idea. Now I
“have found the form of Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ put
“up with Quinine (called Iron ‘Jelloids’
“No. 2A) to be an excellent tonic for men,
“and may be specially recommended.”
Breathing, hurried and gasping, on the slightest exertion, pale cheeks
lacking the ruddy glow of health, bloodless lips, a general feeling of weari-
ness —accompanied maybe by pain after food, indigestion—constipation,
listlessness, inability of application to any pursuit or even train of thought
depression of spirits, and irritability of temper. Such symptoms indicate
Anaemia, and should, on no account, be neglected.

will remove the causes and symptoms of Anaemia. Iron is
what your system requires. By taking it in the form of Iron
‘ Jelloids ’ the not uncommon disadvantages of other Iron
tonics are avoided. No ill-effects are set up. No constipation.
No “rust ”in the stomach. No danger of non-absorption.
No fear of injury to the teeth. If you would have radiant
health, an elastic step and well-braced nerves, you must
have healthy blood. To improve and strengthen the blood
take Iron ‘Jelloids,’ commended by Medical Men, and

easy to take.

Horomoua’s Testimony.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the usual up-country barracks,
and the officer-in-charge was a plain,
earnest-faced little woman who gave
one the impression of having passed the
first part of her life in waiting for a hus-
band who never came (just as some people
wait the results of their “Tatt.’s” tickets),
and, in despair, she seemed to have made up
her mind to devote the rest of her life to
the “work.”
Iloromona was the latest soul added to the
list, and (lie “Captain,” proud of her cap-
ture, was just foaming to present her col-
ored exhibit to a cynical audience.
“Now, Solomon, you stan' up air tell the
people what the hoard lie do for you,” said
the sad-faced officer encouragingly.
“I too proomin’ sy” (shy), replied the
brown warrior.
“Oh, don't mind the people. Speak out
straight for (lie hoard and tell us what the
Ilarmy done fer you.”
Then Iloromona rose to his feet, and after
the manner of his oratorical ancestors,
flooded the hall with his eloquence.
“Werra, my fren’s, I te werry krad I
telioin te Sarrawasin. I krad I kive my
haat te Hoard, He te proomin’ tecen’ ferra
ora same, I tella you.”
(Cries like an angry goose of “sh-h-h-h.
You mustn’t talk like that, Solomon,” from
the skipper.)
“Pe-fore I tchoin te Sarrawasin I make-a
te trink; I make-a te swear; I pray te
pirridd, I go te racis—Oh, py Krise, I te
hot stuff —I too anything—l toan’ care what

‘Rook here, Horomona, t’is Pakeha he wan’

terrim ‘Huh. I pray ’im. Prurry quick too,
if he rikeit.’ Py korry, I make-a te big

Pefore. Not now. Now I kot te ruve-a-
Ivrise in my haart I nava wake te pray te

(Thum-thum-thum-thum on the Army
drum and cries of “Praise the Loard! Glory
be to ’im!” etc., etc.)
“Tat te way, too, pefore, I pack te race-
horse. Gett-a te tam’ pig tivvy, too, some-
time’, I terra you, on te tote. Ten I go

(More drum solo, shrieks of laughter from
the congregation and cries from the plat-
form of “Yais. Loard ! To Thee we give hall
the praise.”)
“Tat te way, too, pefore I tchoin te Army
I prav te foot-a pall. I te prurry good for-
ward‘too. I terra you. Werra near I prake

(More drum music and cries of Ilalley-
luver! ’ls is the praise!”)
‘“Yon know, t’at te way, too. pefore !
ketta te save.’ py korry. if I see te nice-
rookin’ waliine go down te street, py korry I

( Solomon’s better half was supposed to be a
bit flighty! “I summon te cow an’ he get te
fine t P quid. You see I know te raw.”
(Shrieks of laughter smothered in a rollinsr
chorus of “TTalley-lu-yer ! Hal-ley-lu-yer ! I
count dear Loard on Thee-ee-ee-ee.”)
Then the meeting broke up in some dis-
order’

She only thought of him as one more chappie.
He thought a lot of her—the silly muff!
fust the old business, when a minx is pretty;
'Thought her an angel, couldn’t do enough ;
Ran on her errands all around the city.
Painted her. lovely, as a woodland elf:
Wouldn’t exhibit, for he couldn’t spare it;
Hid a wee picture of his own sweet self.
Almost went balmy when she wouldn't wear
it.
She went on making him the same glad eye;
He went on worshipping and getting thinner.
Bought her the best his little dibs could
buy,
Worked like an ass, and went without his
dinner.
Pate is a funny wench, and has her joke
Even with donkeys, like our painter Johnnie ;
So that, like Byron, one fine day he woke,
Found himself famous, making pots of
money.
Likewise, this undeserving artist cove
“Came into” money, more than he could

Then swore he’d dedicate his days to love ;>
Adding the rider, “Damn me, if I marry !”

“Gazeeka” : Maoriland is full of the Rule
Britannia variety of patriotism, just now,
but the real sort is less apparent. Most of
Ihe merchants have subscribed to the various
patriotic funds, and the ones that haven’t
have at least joined in patriotic songs when-
ever possible. However, these things have
not prevented them from deciding that, owing
to the gravity of the crisis, prices must be
raised. Flour has gone up £2 per ton, although
there is enough of it to last till April
and flour is a local product. Also there has
been a general rise of 10 per cent, on other
lines. Thus is fulfilled the old confidence-
man’s injunction, viz: On no account let
your virtuous right hand know what your
left hand stealeth.
When poor old excited Kaiser William
received the Japanese declaration of war
last week he probably wasn’t worried. lie
lias got used to that sort of thing now.
Probably he just told the Hereditary Cham-
berlain or the Grand Falconer or somebody
to put the thing on tlie file with tlie rest of
the troubles, and to put the file away in the
pantry along with tlie sauerkraut and the
lager beer.
By C. A. Jeffries, 214 George-street,
Sydney (in conformity with the Act) :
The Liberal “rally” at Sydney Town Hall was a
somewhat sordid attempt to identify the cause of
Liberalism in Australia with that of the British Em-
pire in a world of contention. With great dignity
Senator Millen proceeded to paste his party’s elec-
tioneering .placard on the hindquarters of the British
Lion. Patriotic songs, such as “Hearts of Oak,”
“When the Empire Calls,” and “Sons of the Sea,”
were sung, and a band blared forth martial music.
Between the bursts of splendid melody the voices of
Watt and Millen cooed to the electors. Senator
Millen denied that the Labor party was responsible
for the existence of the Australian fleet: “It was the
outcome of tlie advice of one of the finest experts in
the world that the Deakin-Cook Government approved
of what was known as tlie ‘fleet unit,’. ” declared
Senator Milieu. The statement evoked loud cheers.
A RE L ONGA, VITA BREVIS.
While standing by all we have written on the in-
decency of political wrangling at such a time, the
fact remains that the elections, rightly or wrongly,
are to be held, and that places upon us the necessity
of entering into the contest and fighting it out in
the usual way, and by the usual methods.
Sydney TELEGRAPH, recently.
"I mighter bin out on a bonzer flag-flappin'
jag wiv me friend Bruce now; but dooty
is dooty......Well, here goes!"
where it should have been met with half-bricks. The
first mention of an Australian fleet was in the policy
speech of Andrew Fisher at Gympie in 1908, when
lie proposed a much larger and more efficient affair
than we have to-day. Cook bitterly opposed the idea,
lie spoke of it as “a toy fleet,” and also “a tinpot
fleet.” Some of the proposed cruisers were to be of
the type known as “the river class,” meaning thereby
that they were to be ocean-going cruisers of a. type
which, in the Imperial Navy, were all called after
British rivers. Cook was moved to such scorn that
the resources of the English language were inadequate
for its full expression. “What rivers,” he asked,
with a snort and a roar, “were these wretched boats
to operate on ?” But the Fisher Government perse-
vered with its scheme, and the British Admiralty
heartily approved of it. Senator Pearce, Labor Min-
ister for Defence, had his gripsack packed to attend
a conference in London on the subject of Dominion
fleet units. Cook and the Liberals were still raging
against the plan, and the Dreadnought foolishness
was booming. Cook was roaring that the fate of
Australia would be settled in the North. Sea and
not the Pacific. Fisher had assumed office Nov. 13,
1908. His Ministry was defeated June 2, 1909, and
Deakin became Prime Minister, with Cook as Minister
for Defence. On attaining this high estate Cook
made the horrible discovery that the Admiralty, the
War Office and the British Government approved cf
■the Labor scheme of defence by land and sea. The
“tinpot fleet and kid army” were earnestly desired
by the Imperial authorities. So the Deakin-Cook crowd
adopted the idea. It could do nothing else. The
British Government wouldn’t have its ridiculous
Dreadnought, and was anxious to see the Fisher scheme
pushed on. Pearce did not attend the conference in
London, the Deakin-Cook crowd meanly cancelling his
commission. Later on, Cook, as war lord, toiled
round She country in pain and excruciating anguish,
in the train of Field-Marshal Kitchener, who came
out specially to lay down the lines on which the “kid”
army' should be constructed. Certainly it was the
advice of Admiral Henderson and Lord Kitchener that
enabled the snarling Cook to swallow his own previous
remarks on the scheme, turn himself inside out, and
adopt and develop what he had previously condemned
in toto. It enabled him to do it just as the strong
arm of the irate mamma suddenly pushing the recalci-
trant kid into the bath, feet first, enables that imp
to perform his ablutions.
The Sulnev Telegraph supplies wonder-
ful information these days. For instance it
was slated in ail article last Saturday:
During the whole of last century the sanctity of
treaties was inviolable.
Most certainly! Napoleon I. never broke
treaties. There was no breach of faith about
the downfall of the German Confederation of
1848. No one ever guaranteed the integrity
of Denmark and then stole nearly half its
territories. The idea that the Orange River
was fixed as the boundary between the Briton
and the Boer is mere delusion. In fact,
pretty nearly everything, including the break-
age of the Convention of Gastein, and the
other evidences that Bismarck was a very
swift customer, was delusion. Tlie 19th cen-
tury was a time when everybody was honest,
and nobody dreamt of playing it low down on
anybody.
"Moana” : Apropos remarks (B. 30/7/’l4)
about the way the Sydney alderman deals
with the dog and the garbage of the city.
Many years ago Christchurch (M.L.) built
an up-to-date destructor in the centre of
the town to minimise cartage. There it
burnt the refuse of the city, including the dog
and the deceased cat. The heat
so produced was used to gener-
ate steam, which was harnessed
up to a bi ,v electrical plant that
supplied hundreds of big con-
sumers with light and power,
and returned a big profit to the
Council. The steam was also
used to heat the water in tin
municipal swimming bath
Christchurch, where visitinj
comedians always earn a roai
by remarking that everythin;,
except Free Love is controlh <
by the Council, is a fine adver-
tisement for municipal Social
ism. It is the cleanest and best
conducted town in Loan Land,
its streets are well kept, its re-
serves and gardens are a credit
to it. The fine electric tram-
way service is owned and con
trolled by the people; and the
same system of management i
about to be adopted with milk,
bread, fish and vegetables. Also
the Flat City is an example of
what can be done under an anti-
borrowing policy. Auckland,
Wellington and Dunedin have
borrowed money right and left in
recent years, and their city debts
are awful to contemplate.
Christchurch has always set its face against
this mad policy, and vet to-day, although
its municipal debt is only about one quarter
that of any of the other large cities, it is
the best-kept and managed town of the four
and has the best public facilities.
John Bull has taken a vow. He has taken
it on his tall hat, and his beer, and his bull-
dog and his roast beef. According to the
more or less reliable (able intelligence, all
able-bodied British tourists who were found
in Germany at the breaking out of the war
were set to work in the fields as harvesters.
And the swear which Bull lias sworn by his
cheap loaf and his top-boots is that, should
he capture the Kaiser, the said potentate will
be made to cart 200 loads of manure before
he recovers his freedom.
After all the bygone wars and tlireatenings
of war, with the avowed purpose of preserv-
ing the Dardanelles Strait inviol-
able from invasion by foreign
warships it was a matter for bitter
public derision that two flying
German battleships were able to
take refuge there the other week
with the friendly sanction of the
sick old Turkish Government. Evi-
dently German diplomacy has made
good in Constantinople, and the
“neutrality” of the Turks has a
strong _ bias towards the side
which is agin their old enemies, the
Russians. What are treaties and
declarations worth, anyhow? When
a Government signs a treaty of
alliance which is not endorsed by
national sentiment, as in the case
of Italy’s nominal compact with
Austria and Germany, the docu-
ment doesn’t amount to a row of
beer. The forming of the Triple
Alliance was a solemn farce. The
Turkish Government’s declaration
of neutrality is already proved to
be a half-lie, and the nature of the other
half is under grave suspicion. The Sultan’s
pachas are only waiting to see whether they
have pinned their faith to the right horse or
the wrong one.
Not only does Gregor McGregor’s death
give Liberalism, a Senate seat unopposed, but
by reason of the probable closeness of the
voting for the S. Australian Senators, Labor
may easily lose the other five seats. The
only way to avert this calamity is for the
party to couple the least reactionary Fusion-
ist with the Labor five and stick to that plan.
It may place the chosen enemy away at the
top of the poll, but it should leave the other
five Fusionists at the bottom.

not Government paper, but private bank-
notes. Repayment of mortgages can’t be
demanded till the war is over. The Govern-
ment has assumed power to suspend pay-
ment of ordinary debts by proclamation.
The export of gold is prohibited—but not
(alas!) the export of lOU’s and debentures
and Government securities. So, apparently,
no matter how badly Britain wants a half-
sovereign. Maoriland, in the wild flush of its
’oyalfy, won’t supply the article.
POLITICS.
YARRAM, Friday.—Mr. Bennett addressed a meeting-
in the Yarram Mechanics’ Hall last evening. He
stated that be had received a message from the
Prime Minister, who had requested him to inform the
electors that residents of other nationalities were to
be treated with the greatest possible courtesy.
WUN H I: "All li’ , Missa Cook , me savee
politics. My wife gottem vote. You come
in si’ kissee my baby?”
“Historian”: Some modern philosopher
has laid it down that the leopard cannot
change his spots—he can only change from
one spot to another. Kaiser William was
generally supposed to have grown into a
sort of domestic tabby ; but underneath his
veneer of common sense he was the same
old international larrikin who, in 1890,
said: “There is only one master in this
country, and I am he. I shall suffer no
other beside me. I see in the people and
the land which has descended to me a
CAKRIED UNANJMOUALY.
The Trusts can safely he left in the hands of the
Liberal party.— General election statement.
talent entrusted to me by God, which it is
my duty to increase. Those who will help
me I heartily welcome; those who oppose
me I shall dash in pieces.” He is now doing
his imperial dash and bursting his buttons
in a terrific struggle to get out of his own
national front door. Somehow it doesn't
seem to be the sort of struggle an attempted
world-conqueror should have to engage in
for a start. Immediately opposite the front
door is the gutter of oblivion, and a com-
pletely exhausted person is liable to fall
into it.
THE CALL OF THE NATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When members had taken their places in the
Legislative Assembly the Premier rose anti said : “The
circumstances in which we meet to-day are known to
all of us. ...It is impossible to compose ourselves for
the minor matters of politics and legislation. We
think, therefore, that the House will, agree with the
appropriateness of an adjournment to this day week,
and I move accordingly.— Melbourne Age.
The Nation and the Empire call.
To serve one’s native land is sweet,
Wherefore with boldness let us all
Go firmly forth our Fate to meet
With ready hands and steadfast feet.
[Singing. ]
The Nation calls, and we must obey.
Gome, fit us be earning our sov. per day
By knocking off work in the usual way !
[Outburst of loud cheering, confined entirely to State
members.]
The guns go by (oh, cheer and yell!),
The flag flaps forth upon the breeze,
And though we know that war is I fell,
Who cares, when movements such as these
From toil the legislator frees?
[ Roaring. ]
Properly this is the patriot’s lot,
Loyally lounging around to spot
The latest posting of news-or-not.
[Further cheering, at six sovs. a week.
With cheers and groans the welkin rings
For Gallic pal and German pig, :
While every day the. cable brings
More rumors grave arid portents big—
The dove of peace has hopped the twig.
t Whooping.]
Oh, war is wine to the patriot’s brain,
When, yelling, he yelleth not in vain;
Three cheers, ’n’ six quid, ’n’ let’sh do it
again!
[Continuous cheering, mingled with patriotic cries of
“Wosh yoursht” and “Haveanmzer!”]
For darker days we must prepare.
The blood-wet finger on the wall
Traces a crimson warning there,
So in loud war-songs let us all
Lift up our voices now, and bawl!
[Screaming.]
To blazes with counsellors mild and meek !
Scalps and the spilling of gore we seek.
Leave us our jobs—-and a war a week !
[A few more cheers,“hear-hears” and beers, after which
6b M’s.L.A. presently retire to 65 armchairs to
read the war-news in the evening papers.]

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The financial ghost in the N.S.W. Cricket
Association’s cupboard is not such a hideous affair,
after all. The present season blows off with a credit
balance of £1943 11s. lid., which, with library,
furniture, etc., lifts the gross assets to £2064 4s. sd.
The Association dropped £ 501 19s. lid. last year, and
with only an inter-State bill-o’-fare ahead, the out-
look for the treasury isn’t too bright for the season
to come. The new blood in the Association, how-
ever, may knock the anaemic pastime into the good
graces of the public. Cricket hardly remembers what
it is like to be in public favor, and a change would
be for the good of its health and pocket generally.
The Lacrosse Associations of Victoria and
S.A. —probably the two strongest in Australia —are
conducting a vigorous quarrel, caused by, of all
unlikely things, the war in Europe. The South Aus-
tralians, due to visit Melbourne, asked, at a few
days’ notice, to call the match “off.” In fact, they
said they couldn’t, and wouldn’t, go. The Victorians
reply in a pained manner that this is unfair treat-
ment, and may lead to a permanent breach. The
Adelaide men simply can’t understand that point of
view, especially as iaerosse travellers mostly have to
pay their own expenses. “Is this a time,” they ask
pathetically, “just when half of us are uncertain
whether we can hold on to our various billets, to
draw our little savings out of the bank and approach
the boss on the subject of a holiday ?”
This paper has been deluged of late by
inquiries as to which is the stronger, benzine or
petrol spirit. There seems to he an enormous amount
of betting on the subject throughout all Eastern
Australia. They are practically the same thing.
Petrol spirit is derived from petroleum or petroleum
shale, and benzine is distilled from coal, which is a
distinction without much difference. Some benzines
may be stronger than some petrols, and vice versa.
The most powerful spirit known is the petrol obtained
from Australian oil shale; but as benzine has not
been made from Australian coal it is impossible to
compare them.
The Dunlop Rubber Co. is organising
two patriotic contributions, to he known respectively
as “The Motorists’ Patriotic Fund” and the
“Cyclists’ ” ditto. There are over 25,000 motorists
and 200,000 cyclists in Australia, and most of
them have a hoi) to spare. The Dunlop co. requests
them to send along what they can right away.
Seventy-five per cent, of the moneys will go to the
Australasian Patriotic Fund, and 25 per cent, to
the British Red Cross Society. It is a good cause,
so everybody is requested to get busy with postal
notes. Money can be sent direct to the eo. at 255
Clarence-street, Sydney, or he paid in through any
local motor or cycle agent. The eo. itself heads the
list with £lOOO, but wfll not ho angry if anyone
donates £2OOO or even £lO,OOO. But it relies
mostly on the half-crowns and dollars of the average
cyclist and the pounds of the army of motorists.

To give any adequate idea of tin' splendor
and magnitude of the tattoo and carnival being
organised by Reginald Baker, of Sydney Stadium
fame, would occupy the whole of this page. It is
going to he the biggest thing of its kind ever
organised in the city. It is to he naval, military
and athletic. It will commence with an enormous
parade through the city to the Agricultural Ground,
where a variety of weird and amazing evolutions will
he gone through by motorists, motor-cyclists, men on
horseback, men on foot, and men who walk on their
hands in order to save their hoots. There will ho
athletic displays and contests. There will he mar-
tial music and wild dances hv men in kilts. There
will he everything and anything that will interest
and amuse and give an excuse to provide cash for
patriotic purposes. In the evening there will he a
grand assault-at-arms at the Stadium itself; and
the fun will be fast and furious. The day—der tag
—is Monday, September 7, the anniversary of the
surrender of Copenhagen in 1807. It is also the
anniversary of Borodino, when the Russians put up
an almighty scrap against Napoleon, also of the cap-
ture of Warsaw by flic Russians in 1831, and the
revolution in Brunswick- which ended in the flight
of the Duke in 1830, and many other important
events.
Some day, unless the future is wonder-
fully kind, the thousands who watch Melbourne’s
hoofball on Saturdays will themselves be playing a
sterner sort of game, even as Europe’s peaceful
toilers of a month ago are now playing Moltke’s
war game. And when that day comes it is to be
hoped the battlers will be better trained than the
C'ollingwood Magoies, who threw away most of their
“final” chances for a mess of pottage or thereabouts.
They got back from Brisbane the night before, and,
tackling the fairly competent and decently-trained
men from South Melbourne, found their holidav
relaxations too much for them, their wind hopelessly
short and their kick in a- awry. So they went down by
36 points to South’s 57, thus nutting the latter into
third place beyond hoDe of eviction. The only other
game that mattered was Geelong’s upheaval against
St. Kilda. it being necessary for the Seasiders to
win to hold their chance of reaching “the four.” They
stuck to it in the end by 61 points to St. Hilda’s
45. ’Wood and Geelong, level in the scores, meet
next Saturday to decide which shall stay in the fourth
place, and it is to be hoped the League will abandon
its foolish last week’s caper of putting a brand new
umpire to control an important match. It doesn’t
give the man a chance, and it annoys those who have
paid in the hope of seeing a good game. For the
rest, ’Roy downed the Students by 127 to 38 ; Carl-
ton smashed Essendon b' r 71 to 50, and Richmond
wiped the paddock with Melbourne by 105 to 58.
On the East Melbourne ground the Vic.
Football Ass. brought its bogging to a final close, in
a blaze of blinding dust, much enthusiastic endeavor
and a ton or so of “Blime!” The scufflers were
North and ’Serav —last year’s premiers—and the
episode was cheerful and ornamental until the last
quarter. Then North’s superior system prevailed, and
’Scray “did its block” —which is the equivalent of
“went baresark” —to a certain extent. This, of
course, helped North all the more, and last year’s
runners-up ultimately grabbed the pennant by 86
points to 51. Pending the arrival of the cricket
season a month hence these unemployed boggers-in
are earnestly recommended to try practising with a
smaller ball—a nickel or steel one, heaved out of
a barrel at a much smaller goal.
Sydney football has been considerably
upset by the enlistment of many prominent players,
who have started out to sack and burn Berlin. As
far as the Rugby League is concerned the' affair came
too late to make any real difference. Even Kaiser
BStl, with all his legions, could not alter Hie destina-
tion of the League premiership. South Sydney was
ahead by one point, gained by the defeat of Newtown
two or three weeks ago, and that advantage it main-
tained. Although South has won the championship
the deciding team was that of Balmain. But for the
fact that it stamped down Newtown that memorable
afternoon, Newtown would have worn the laurel
wreath instead of occupying the position of runner-
up with 22 points to South’s 23. Eastern Suburbs, last
year’s premier team, was a long way out of it, and
shared the third line with Balmain, each with 16
points to its credit. Glebe had 15, and North Sydney
11. and Western Suburbs and Annandale six and three
each. Eastern Suburbs came to grief on Saturday at
the hoots of Balmain, which looks likely to win the
ri(\- Cun, a sort of consolation trophy for the,teams
which have lost the premiership. Balmain went
baresark from the jump, and at half-time was leading
by five to two. The opening of Ihe second half saw
a fine effort by East to level the score. But Balmain
pulled down every charge, and lifted the winning
record to seven to two. Then despair gat hold on
East Sydney, and it struggled to avoid an utter rout.
And although Balmain, which, by the way, is the
undefeated team of the second round, scored another
field goal, the rout was avoided. Still, the walloping
(nine to two) was severe. But it might easily have
been worse. South Sydney had an easy task with
Annandale. and squelched the defence with 14 points
to five. Newtown smashed up North Sydney by 20
points to 12, and Globe overthrew Western Suburbs
by 13 to five.
In tbe Sydney Rugby Union division there
is only one more round to go, and at present Glebe
is on top of the A division with 24 points to the
22 of South Sydney. Eastern Suburbs and Univer-
sity have 17 and 14 resnectively. In the B section
Western Suburbs is top dog (17 points), with St.
George and North Sydney racing close behind
(15 each). Randwick lias 12, Newtown 10, and
Balmain and Manly six and four. Saturday was a
day of heavy scoring. Glebe trampled over Eastern
Suburbs to the tune of 20 to seven. Western Suburbs
smashed Balmain by 18 to three. St. George rushed
Manly to the cemetery by 17 to eight, and North Syd-
ney dog-walloped Randwick by 26 to 12.
Only one match was played under the
Australian code on Saturday,, and it was a row
between Central Western and Newtown (o decide
which should qualify for Hie semi-finals. Central
Western won, by 72 points to 33.
A BUSTED VISION.
Herb McCoy's dreams of lightweight laurels
vanish into thin air.
The Soccer hoofball game in Sydney is
like the war. It is almost impossible to follow on
account of the numbers engaged, the vast area they
are spread over, and the variety of objects, premier-
ships and trophies that are being contended for.
There was a struggle between Y.M.C.A. and Lith-
gow Thistle on Saturday for a look in at the final
struggle for the State championship. The Good
Young Men were too much for the hard-swearing
heathen of Lithgow, and by good combination and
straight kicking landed the ball in the not three
times in the first half. Lithgow succeeded in accom-
plishing this trick only once. The second half found
both sides beastly aggressive, but neither of them
skilful enough to break through, and when the
whistle blew the Y.M.C.A. was still on top with
three goals to one. In the First League Premiership
contest there are eight metropolitan teams, repre-
senting the crowded area that lies between North
Sydney and the iron-working suburb of Granville,
The iron-workers head the list with 26 points. Bal-
main, which also works considerably in iron, and
occasionaly builds ships of it, comes second with 18
points—which is a somewhat long second. Sydney
District has 15, Annandale 14, Canterbury 10, and
three other clubs have only single figures, wherefore
the veil of merciful secrecy is thrown over them.
“Bilrock” (from London): John Bull,
London’s hard-hitting weekly, launched a bomb into
the midst of the fistic world in the shape of an
article exposing an alleged fake by that bombastic
boxer, J. Johnson, Esq., in connection with his recent
collision with Moran. Unlike the anarchists, the
journal heralded the approach of its bomb by plas-
tering town and country with thousands of posters
bearing the following startling legends: “Jack .John-
son, the Crook,” “Good-bye, Johnson —for ever!
“J. Johnson, Boxer, Braggart and Swindler,” and
the paper sold like hot saveloys on a cold day at
the races. John Bull supports its allegations by a
printed statement from the pen of Johnson s manager
and secretary, Henri Wolf; and displays at the
foot of the article an alleged copy of the signed take
agreement. It seems that the black pug. has been
under deep suspicion amongst the boxing fraternity
•for some time past. Always bragging of liis prowess,
he evinced a strong disinclination to defend his
title, and it was only after great difficulty that Dan
McKetrick, hv clever strategy, dragged him into the
ring to meet Moran. If the story of Henri AVolf is
true the nearer the day of the tight approached the
stronger grew Lil’ Arthuh’s desire to back out.
Finally the champion approached McKetrick, and in-
sisted that there should be a clear understanding
that he must win the fight—that Mac should con-
firm an agreement by which the nig. would receive
60 per cent, and Moran 40 per cent, of the gate, pro-
vided the AYhite Mope agreed to lose inside eight
rounds. McKetrick felt that the end justified
the means, and afterwards confided to Wolf that he
would promise anything to get Johnson into the
ring. The signed agreement, a facsimile of which
John Bull reproduces, runs thus:—
"MATCH JOHNSON-MORAN FOUR LE CHAMPION
AT DU MONDE.
June 27, 1914.
I hereby agree to divide the receipts of my contest
with Frank Moran oil June 27 on a basis of forty per
cent, to Moran and sixty per cent, to me, provided
that Frank Moran loses inside of eight rounds.
Jack Johnson.
Then follows a sentence in Lil’ Arthuh's handwriting:
“After fight must return this receipt.” Come to
think of it, there was ample indication of some sort
of a fake in that mill, for, as I stated in my report
of the scrap in a previous issue, time and again Moran
came in wide open to the knock-out, and it was
clearly by permission of Mistah Johnsing (after he
had piled up sufficient points to ensure the win) that
the white man stayed the 20 rounds. A dog-weary
public is now awaiting developments. Meantime, a
long ebony streak of humanity is turning Paris
upside down in a vain effort to find a gent named
Henri Wolf.
“Bilrock”: Brief though it was, the col-
lision between Bombardier Wells and Colin Bell fur-
nished a ding-dong mix-up, in which hard slogging,
as exemplified by the Australian heavyweight, bumped
up against scientific boxing delivered by a vastly-
improved Bom ardier. Although Hell’s efforts suf-
fered by comparison with the undoubtedly brilliant
display of Wells, the Bombardier was never quite
safe until the end of the mill. Had any one of the
Australian’s- terrific punches, which Wells always
cleverly managed to deflect, happened to make a
straight contact, the Englishman's name to-day would
have been Mud. There is only one adjective that can
describe Wells’ winning hit —Boshter. It was a clean
hit, perfectly timed, that “went through,” and it
would have felled a bullock. Next week Wells will
appear twice nightly at the Oxford Music llall
(London), where he will endeavor to demonstrate on
certain sparring partners the punch with which lie
outed Bell, and it is rumored that applications for
the said positions of sparring partner are as scarce
as dust storms on the summit of Kosciusko. The
world’s championship lightweight contest, which
went the full 20 rounds and resulted in an un-
qualified victory for Welsh, was something to write
home about. Ritchie is no sluggard, but the speed
of Welsh was a revelation. liis judgment of time
and distance was nothing less than amazing. He
fooled the Yank at every point of the compass. He
came in, smote, and cut loose again before Ritchie’s
thinking machinery could evolve a counter move. He
iabbed, stabbed, sliced, jolted, knocked and shocked
the Amurkan to a standstill. At times it fairly
rained welts, and Willie Ritchie was always right in
the middle of the dowi pour; hut he took it all as
gamely as if he had been suckled on uppercuts and
spoon-fed on jabs and jolts. Time and again the
crowd cheered William for liis plucky stand. Towards
the end of the fight his face looked like a full-blown
lose that a fat girl has sat oh between dances. -
- Throup-hout it was a wonderfully fair fight, fought for
the greater part in silence, the crowd evidently real-
ising that the man who got the wrong end of the
. verdict would lose not only the title but an assured
income of anything- between £lO,OOO and £20,000
per annum. At the final gong there was hardly any
necessity to indicate the winner. The crowd reared
itself upon its hind legs and yelled, and some 3000
Welsh sports who had journeyed down from Wales
in half a dozen “specials,” greeted the victor with
the Welsh National Anthem, which, to a sensitive
person, is worse than 10 upppereuts, one occipital
wallop, and a half-arm jolt on the solar plexus.
Westralian boxer Michael King now holds
the middleweight championship of Australia, having
scored three successive victories over all comers. He
smacked Nat Williams twice and banged Evernden
once. Crimps, who till recently held the title, refused
to leave his farm to defend it, and the King-Kvernden
scrap was for the forfeited honor. In the ninth round
the online saved Evernden from the knock-out. Darcy,
the Maitland blacksmith, is looked upon as King’s
next opponent, and will probably do battle with him
at, Sydney. King belongs to the tribe which hits;
solidly and all the time, but, somehow, he seems to
lack the convincing sort of punch which nuts the
defeated man out of his misery in short order. His
knock lacks the decisive finish that is associated
with the full reach of a mule’s hind leg.
Jeremiah the prophet, otherwise Jerome,
the Queensland a' original bruiser, was given a return
match against Jules Dubourg, the Frenchman, at Bris-
bane recently, and got into the ring in worse con-
dition than ever. He was hog fat. Jeremiah never
will train properly, and this time his Lamentations
of tissue were not only nil, but he had apparently
piled on flesh while he thought he was preparing for
the scrap. The result was that he winded himself
trying to reach the wary Gaul, and was so done up
in the ninth chapter of the Book of Bang that the
towel was sent in to save his boiler from bursting.
This will probably be the last fight of Jeremiah, the
prophet. He is getting too old for the game. He
owns up to being 44, and as his mother did not pre-
serve his birth certificate, he may be more. On the
other hand, he may be less. Anyhow, whatever he
is in years he is a wonder, and the fights he has put
up without proper training have been a glory to Aus-
tralia. He has had few knock-outs registered against
him, but one early in his career was verv decisive.
He always tights with considerable paunch. Or.
rather, he takes a considerable paunch into every
battle with him, being unable to tear himself awav
f'l'oni it. To protect it and keep it out of harm’s way
he always adopts a crouch and lopes round the ring-
more like, a lower animal than a man. In one battle
against some fighter this scribe disremembers his
paunch rolled round into the forefront of the arma-
ment and stopped a wild left swing. Jerry dropped
his guard, and grabbing his bingy with both hands
rolled on the floor. When the referee got to eight
Jeremiah found his voice and gasped: “You can
count a plurrv hundred, but I’m not getting up!"
And he didn't.

The long-looked-for scrap between llughie
Mehegan and Herbert McCoy, lor the lightweight
championship of Australia, at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night, was a stubborn, rugged battle from
beginning- to end. McCov had the skill and Mehegan
had the wallop. McCoy did not display his usual
speed, and -Mehegan was quicker than he has been for
a long time, lie weighed 9st. 841 b. to McCoys 9st. .
7:{lb., but looked bigger and stronger, and he had’l
the advantage of reach. I-larald Baker was the third
party to the disturbance, but had an easy time of
it. The boxers obeyed implicitly and promptly.
Mehegan never gives any referee trouble, and is the
fairest tighter imaginable—too fair for his own
advantage sometimes. The hard-hitting started from
the word go, and McCoy used a straight left prettilv
and with considerable effect; but suddenly discov-
ered to his dissatisfaction that Mehegan had culti-
vated a particularly dangerous uppercut which, in
the very first clinch, narrowly missed ending the
battle. McCoy did not try to be elusive, but stood
up and mixed it. Mehegan had. thrown away his
crouch, and stood in Jem. Mace style, and had lie
only used a straight left this writer is under the
impression McCoy could not have reached him. But
he was more inclined to hook and chop than drive.
In the third session Mehegan landed a left of some
tonnage on McCoy’s commissariat, and followed up
with the right to the jaw. McCoy was badly rattled,
but managed to hang on till the end. He came out
.of his corner_and tried to carry the war into his
enemy in a literal sense, by forcing liis glove down
Mchegan’s neck. Hughie’s face seemed to split, but
whether he was smiling or not is hard to say. It
might have been a smile, but it might have been
anything. The round developed into a wild rally,
in which both parties got hurt. McCoy began to
feel that llughie was crowding him too much, and
kept making room lor his opponent in a most polite
manner; but, in order that he might not feel-too neg-
lected, he would occasionally rush back with a straight
left that bent Mehcgan’s head backwards. lint
Mehegan was tough, and he kept on hitting hardei
and harder. One blow of Mehegan's was as destruc-
tive as three of McCoy’s. In the eighth round
Mehegan almost got his plucky adversary, lie bored
right in and let fly soul-shaking lefts and rights to
the body and the head. In spite of the battering
McCoy came back and strove to even up the points
He used his straight left again and once more, and
Mehegan could neither guard nor dodge it. In the
10th McCoy had another narrow escape. He was
fencing very prettily when Mehegan charged like
a hull and hurled his fists in front of him as In-
charged. lie banged McCoy against the ropes and
battered him till tile gong stopped the action. Then
Mehegan began to tire, and seemed to lose the
instinct to hurl his fist at the'other fellow. McCoy,
who had recuperated wonderfully during the spell,
got all over him. Mehegan kept finessing for an
opening instead of battering his way in in his
characteristic style, and when he got the opening
McCoy would lightly, brightly skip away. In the
13th Mehegan suddenly recovered his hitting- power,
and great was the smash he gave Herbert, but
Herbert, though somewhat groggy, survived it.
McCoy was in danger of a knock-out all the time.
The Ifitli brought the beginning of the end: Out
of a wild mix up Mehegan sent a heavy one to the
jaw, and McCoy, turning his back on him, reeled
towards the ropes and held himself up. The chival-
rous llughie looked at him instead of following him
up, and only the wild roar of the delighted audience
roused him to a sterner sense of duty. McCoy had
slightly recovered, and alternately clung like an
oyster and fought like a dazed tiger-cat, till the gong-
saved him. He came out as fair and warlike as
ever and made a gallant show. But, his legs were
trembling and he was all but done. Mehegan stood
right in and mixed it. There was a flutter, and
out of the melee McCoy lurched sideways, fell
on his side and rolled over face downwards. The
voice of Harald Baker, counting the seconds as
they flashed redly from the clock, was drowned in
the din of applause. As the referee threw out his
hands in sign of “Finis” Mehegan bounded in, bent
down and carried his opponent to his chair. Then,
natural elation getting the better of him, he walked
hack io the centre of the ring, and for five seconds
drank the milk of Paradise. Half an hour later lie
shared a bottle of champagne with his fallen rival
and assured him that he hoped the mantle of the
lightweight championship of Australia, when he
hurled it into space, as he intended to -do shortly,
would fall on the shoulders of Herbert McCoy.

“Bilrock” (from the ground ) : Fight-pro-
moter C. B. Cochran is smashing all British records
with his “gates” at Loandon’s big Olympia. The
Bombardier Wells-Bell scrap drew a crowd that all but
’ filled the huge horse-show building at prices ranging
from 7s. fid. to £2 2s. Things looked so-rosy that
in the following week up went the prices for the
collision between Ritchie and Welsh for the light-
weight championship of the world, and it was thought
by some that Cochran was courting the anger of the
gods of biff. But London’s “Mclnstoush” knew his
crowd. The public arose with the lust of battle in

The Corps of Veterans in Adelaide brought
up a few stirring memories at a patriotic
rally the other day. It produced a Crimean
veteran, a Zulu lighter, and one of the few
remaining who defended Lucknow. There
was a Frenchman who fought against Ger-
many in 1870, and the Roman Catholic
chaplain, Le Maitre, claimed to have taken
part in a little civil war in Belgium about
1890, and to know all about the Liege forts.
Then a corporal remarked that he was not
only the only Australian-born one among
them, but the only veteran fit for active
service, and he proposed to go to Europe
with the force now forming. (Loud cheer-
ing. )
“Murkah”: As an operator I’m tired of
so-called wireless miracles, especially Ameri-
can ones, which are one-hundredth part fact
and ninety-nine-hundredths Yankee hot-air.
For instance, one night when about a thou-
sand miles out of San Francisco, I was asked
to relay a message. It was from the ship
Mongolian, but was given to me by the
Missourian, so it had already been relayed
once. I pushed it off to San Francisco.
Next day the ’Frisco Call weighed out with
a column, headed “Cong Distance Wireless:
Japan to San Francisco,” speaking of the
message as a direct communication. In fact,
which isn't the same as fiction, the greatest
distance from its source that a “wireless”
wave has been detected is about 6000 miles.
That was from the high-powered Transat-
lantic “thunder house” at Clifden Island to
the lofty aerial of the installation at Buenos
Ayres.

Convinced that there is no section of the Public in Australia that is more
patriotic and willing to assist in the collection of an Australian Patriotic
Fund, for the sustenance of our citizens who, in consequence of the War,
are deprived of means of livelihood, we have decided to appeal to Cyclists
throughout the Commonwealth to subscribe to a
Cyclists’ Patriotic Fund
which will be subsequently apportioned as follows :--75 per
cent, to the Australian Patriotic Fund, and 25 per cent, to the
Red Cross Society. We have donated .£lOOO to the Cause.
Cyclists! Here’s the chance to show collectively and individ-
ually your patriotism to the cause. We feel confident that
you will help swell the fund, and make it worthy of Cyclists
in this part of the world. If every Cyclist in Australia gives
according to his means, a large sum will be collected—that’s
something to work for, and something that Cyclists can look
back on with pride, and the knowledge that they have helped
—when help was needed for the Empire’s cause.

TOILET
DISTRESSING lack of hail - will mar
the most beautiful face, and aftel - all
there is really no need to have poor or im-
poverished hair if a few common-sense rules
are observed. First of all, hair tonics must
be freshly made in order to obtain the best
results, and thousands of women, and men,
too, are now making tip their own lotions
with most satisfactory results. For this
purpose they obtain from the chemist’s one
ounce of boranium and mix this
with 1 -pin t of bay rum, quite a
simple formula, and according to
all accounts remarkably effec-
tive. This simple, home-made
lotion quickly removes all dan-
druff, and creates a growth of
new, healthy hair which will
gladden the heart of any woman.
One word in conclusion. I)o
not experiment with your hair,
long suffering though it may be.
Nature will surely revolt if you
continue to subject the hair and
scalp to all kinds of fanci-
ful treatments. Employ a tonic
by all means if such is required,
but, having found a satisfactory one, use no
other.
OW about shampoos. Is it reasonable
IS to expect that one particular make will
suit everybody? Certainly not. Some folks
have dry and brittle hair, others have tresses
which are excessively greasy'. Each requires
a different grade of shampoo, if one is to
obtain the best results. . The writer’s notice
was recently bnought to a substance called
stallax, which_can.be obtained from most

Grow Hair.”

chemists. It consists of small granules,
which, when mixed with a cup of hot water,
make the most charming mixture imaginable
for shampooing the hair. According to tne
quantity used, so the strength is graduated to
suit all conditions. There is one drawback,
however, and that is stallax can only be
obtained in ilb. tins, _ which cost about
half-a-crown, but as this quantity is sutn-
cient to make 25 to BO shampoos it is
really very economical in the
end.' It leaves the hair a little
too wavy and fluffy for some
tastes, but this can always be
avoided by rubbing a little olive
oil on the _ scalp previous to
its application.
A FEW remarks on face
creams may not be out of
place, and, at the risk of being
put down as a little old-fash-
ioned, my advice on this subject
is to leave well alone. Do not clog
the pores with greasy concoctions
which not only prevent the skin
from performing its proper func-
tions, but usually result in en-
couraging a growth of hair on the fact)

“Hamer”: “Paddy” O’Brien, secretary of
tlie Professional Musicians’ Union, holds the
most lieavily-gilded union job in Sydney —
probably in Australia. Recently his organi-
sation raised the screw to £6OO, a height of
affluence which is staggering to most union
officials. Seeing that “Paddy.”- whose name
is not Patrick, but “Alfred E.”- —was in
charge while the union grew from a poor
little weak thing to a wealthy organisation
which talks about excluding foreign
musicians and spending £20,0.00 on new
club-rooms, and even mentions £(» a week
for work for which less than £3 was paid
not a decade ago, and also considering that
O’Brien’s job includes the management of
the Union’s Club, £6OO doesn’t seem so tre-
mendous, after all. If the man who suc-
ceeds Russell French at the Bank of N. N.
Wales can double hist bosses’ income, they'll
think him cheap at £lO.OOO. All the same,
there are some queer ideas in the Trades
Hall, where the statement has been sol-
emnly made that the man who handles more
than £4 a week gets out of touch with the
workers and can’t help taking the same
view of things as Rockefeller and Lord
Rothschild.
“S.T.S.”: “Giovanni’s” indictment (P>.
23/7/T4) of the “false pretence” of stage
ladies who are “overcome” by the comedian’s
comicalities only touches one side of the
subject. The fact is that an audience just
loves to imagine it is seeing something
which last night’s audience didn’t and to-
morrow’s won’t see; and for the actor to
take advantage of that weakness is natural,
even excusable. Maurice Farkoa and his
partner of the moment used to put up the
very finest bluff of this kind. First-nighters
went about telling everybody : “It was dead
funny. Instead of a stage embrace he
started the real thing—hugged and kissed her
all over the place. The poor girl was all
broken up. She didn’t know which way to
look, and they couldn’t go on for a bit.”
Then one went in on the second evening,
or the 22nd, and saw exactly the same thing
again. But, after all, why complain? It
is. obviously, the very perfection of acting;
and what else does one go to the theatre to
see?
“J.F.H.” (from London) : Stanley
Houghton’s premature passing-out at 32 is
the most serious loss the English stage has
sustained during recent, years. Had lie lived
the author of “Hindle Wakes” and “The
Younger Generation” was the most likely
man to contribute some badly-needed original
plays to the British theatre. His collected
dramas, stories and miscellaneous contribu-
tions to the Manchester Guardian have
been issued in three volumes from the house
of Constable. There is a prefatory memoir
by Harold Brighouse. This brings out the
fact that Houghton owed something of his
success as a playwright to his zeal as an
amateur actor in Manchester. He assumed
some 70 characters in the course of a decade
—studied and acted them seriously, and did
not regard the business as a mere recreation
like the average amateur actor does. But
this meant burning the candle at both ends.
He worked from 0 a.m. till 3 p.m. in his
father’s cotton business, and after that toiled
lili midnight on his literary and dramatic
ambitions. He left several manuscript plays
that have not yet been staged, but soon will
be.
“C. Ockney”: All the recent musical-
comedy successes, much to the disgust of
British librettists and composers, have been
of Teutonic origin. There is, however, likely
to be a slump in these goods until the har-
mony of the European concert is restored.
It. seems strange that the long-familiar label,
“adapted from tbe French,” should have
given place to “made in Germany” in con-
nection with comic opera, but in a comic-
opera world all things are possible. Paris,
as a “gay city.” isn’t in it with Berlin-on-
the-.Tamboree—or wasn’t a few months ago.
“The Girl in the Taxi,” now at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney), was adapted from the
.German. So. also, was “Mam’selle Tralala.”
now running at Ihe Lyric, Shaftesbury
Avenue, where the “Taxi” lady came from.
Robert Courtneidge’s latest Shaftesbury hit,
“The Cinema Girl.” is from the same source,
and the music of all three pieces is by the
same composer—Jean Gilbert. Tt onlv needs
Gilbert, the musician, to find a librettist
named Sullivan and the topsy-turvydom of
the situation will be complete.
“Vagabond”: A London co. has originated
a bright way to give the amateur playwright
a first-class chance of getting his work
staged and sold. The co. advertises that it
wants bright, snappy, one-act plays—wants
them badly and wants them in heaps. You
know you have just the bright, snappy play
they want, and you send it along. Next
you get a polite letter enthusiastically prais-
ing the play and saying it only wants to be
seen to be rushed by eager mr lingers, the
usual rate paid the fortunate writer being
10 per cent, of gross takings while the play-
let runs. The co. is willing to produce it
at a West End music-hall and charge only
a bare £2O for doing so. More than that,
it will give the author £2O worth of tickets,
which he can sell to his friends and so get
his money back. The music-hall mentioned
is one of the best known in the heart of
London theatre land, and the scheme looks
good—especially if you’ve enough friends to
buy up the tickets at ss. each. If you send
along your £2O your play is produced right
enough—at a special matinee performance,
along with five to 10 other similarly hnoked-
in plays. The show is not advertised, and
nobody is in the house except the £2O worth
of each author’s pals. The author lias the
pleasure of watching his stuff played and
drinking the applause of the audience and
tin congratulatory wets of his pals. That’s
all. Thereafter no anxious manager chases
any of the authors with an agreement and
a fountain pen to sign up on the 10 per
cent, basis. The whole performance costs
the co. exactly the hire of the theatre, and
as it books the place when it would other-
wise be wasted, it doesn’t pay much for the
hire. The rest is all bunce to the co., for
the “actors” are roped in on the same terms.
In fact, some are induced to part up for the
privilege of being allow* d to play and to
gain the prospect of booking an engagement.

Dear Bulletin, —I knew there was some-
thing wrong about this war. Where is
Bud. yard Kipling’s poem re the Absent-
Minded or Mentally Absorbed Mendicant
who is going back to Waterloo V—-l ours, etc.,
Solomon Malapkop.
“Croson”: I recently met the twin-sister
of “Rule Britannia’s” loyal British nation
(B. 0/8/T4). A loyalist, and a sound
church woman, to the back teeth, she had no
fears whatever, in the matter of Luropean
complications involving the Umpire, the
burden of her splendid optimism being.
“I’m sure our King is too good a man to
no to war.” The other day she had the
misfortune to meet a violently Il( T" bll can
immigrant, who announced, that Oueen
Mary was to blame for the whole trouble.
I don’t know what he meant, but the effec
on my friend was the same as though she
had said that the Archbishop of Canter-
bury had mortgaged the famous cathedral
to the hilt to pay his gambling debts.
“Paddock-Marshal”: Before a large, bil-
lowy army leaves its dinner-table behind it
and surges towards a frontier, the com-
manders should see that it has got its
appetite to some extent under control, it
seems to me a rash thing to march straight
on to the hungry field of battle a few million
men who are accustomed to get then tine
good meals a day with (probably) a sub-
stantial supper to tide them over until
breakfast. The German vanguard is
alleged to have fought indifferently and to
have surrendered in batches because it had
been without its indispensable sausage for
three whole days. Field-hardened troops
might have survived the test; but it appar-
ently was too much for the Germans, fat
and soft with the sauerkraut and lager of
peace. Kaiser Bill is reported to have
promised his men that they would be
“marching through a smiling country. But
what is a smile to a hungry man > Merely
an irritating show of teeth! Much better
to have a-country howling with rage and
something hot on a dish.
Parson 11. -T. Rose, who has divided • a
30-years’ chaplaincy between two campaigns
and a long stretch as senior sky-pilot (not
aviator —or perhaps it should be “heavenly
aviator”) to the N.S.W., forces, is a man
who should know something about the job
to which it has pleased his Creator to call
him. He is evidently under the impres-
sion that he has the knowledge aforemen-
tioned, and last week he wrote interestingly
in the Sydney Telegraph on some of the
qualifications for it. Scribbled he: “I see
that many ministers and clergy are offering
themselves for active service. . . .May I be
allowed to suggest what sort of parsons may
be likely to do the soldiers good.. We do not
want either deadheads or ecclesiastics. The
former are too expensive a luxury. _The
latter are all right in time of peace. Your
average ecclesiastical functionary is harm-
less and safe. We do not want
smirkers and gushers ; above all, we do not
want fuss-cats. You can pay your money
and take your choice of both sorts.’’
Great snakes! “Deadheads.” “smirkers.’
“gushers.” “FUSS-CATS” !! ! What an
array of titles for the cloth ! Verily, a Phili-
stine appears to have crossed the threshold !
Seven weeks ago, when the question of the
British Admiralty’s dealings with the Anglo-
Persian Oil Co. was under discussion in the
House of Commons. Winston Churchill
assured the House that the Admiralty then
possessed “an oil reserve sufficient for all
war purposes for months to come,” and that,
even in the event of war, the Navy could
command a supply of the fuel. Apparently
the Admiralty has scored a triumph in tm
much-debated oil transaction. It asked tor a
or ran t of £2.200.000 to buy control of the
V pO. Co. before the oil Trusts had got
hold of it. The only political objection to
the scheme was. and is. the fact tiny
150 miles of oil pipes, running through
a rugged country where tribes of law-
less Omar Khayyams divide sovereignty
with the lizard and the wild ass. may need
a lot of .protection from anti-British acquisi
tiveness. But of all the Powers involved i '
the present European rumpus Russia is the
nearest to Persia's heart, and Russia and
Britain are just now joined together in
bonds of mutual war. So the Government
investment in the Anglo-Persian Oil Co.
looks as wise and timely as Beacon sfield s
famous purchase of Suez Canal shares.

Health & New Life for the Weak & Ailing
Get well the ‘‘Wincarnis’’ way —the quick,
sure, safe way to new health. QUICK
because the benefit begins from the first
wineglassful. SURE because it has given
new life to countless thousands of sufferers.
SAFE because it contains no drugs as do
other Wine Tonics. “Wincarnis” (the
Wine of Life) is a Tonic, a Restorative,
a Blood-maker and a Nerve Food—all
contained in one clear delicious beverage.
Are you Run-down ?
Do yon feel listless, low-spirited and weary of
everything? Do you find your work irksome and
your recreation exhausting? If so, you are “Run-
down” and “Out-of-sorts.” But a few doses of
“Wincarnis” will quickly put you right. Take
a wineglassful of “Wincarnis” in the middle of
the morning, and another the last thing at night.
You will be delighted with the new vigor and new
vitality it will give you.
Are you Anaemic ?
Is your face white? Are your lips and gums
bloodless? Are your eyes dull? Does your heart
palpitate? If so, you need “Wincarnis” to fill
your veins with new , rich red blood. Take
“Wincarnis” three times a day.
You will feel better from even
the first wineglassful—you
will feel the new, rich blood
dancing through your veins.

Are you “Nervy”?
Do you “jump” at a sudden sound? Do you feel
irritable? Are you nervous? Do you get head-
aches ? Do you have' neuralgia ? Do you suffer
from nervous debility? That is because your
nerves want “toning• , up.” You need a short
course of “Wincarnis.” “Wincarnis” is a power-
ful nerve builder, Avhich acts directly upon the
nerve centres; and thus transmits new vigor and
new life to the nerves all over the body.
Are you Weak?
Do you feel incapable of exertion ? Does your
work exhaust you ? Do you feel intensely weary
in all vour.limbs? If so, take “Wincarnis” three
times a day, and it will give you new strength and
new vigor. And each day more strength and.
more vigor, until, step by step, it rebuilds your
weakened constitution and recreates your lost
•vitality.
Begin to get well
TO-DAY.
To-day is the best day to begin to get well. Buy
a bottle of “Wincarnis” from your Wine Merchant,
or Licensed Chemist or Grocer, and take advant-
age of the new health and new life “Wincarnis”
oilers you.
But be sure you get “Wiu-
carnis”—don’t waste your
money and risk your health by
accepting a substitute.
THE "1.H.C." ENGINE MAKES EASY WORK
OF ALMOST EVERY FARM JOR.
O WAD AYS, when high wages rule, the cutting down of manual labour wher-
ever possible is not only desirable, but positively essential to the profitable
working of the farm.
With the right power, jobs which were formerly laborious and expensive
are made easy and cheap. If it’s Cutting Wood—Running Separator—Cutting Chaff—Shelling
Corn —Pumping Water, or such like work, then that particular job is one for the “ 1.H.C.”
Gaso-Kero Engine—an Engine that makes good on any work you put it to —requires a
minimum of attention, and costs considerably less for fuel than most other engines.
This fuel saving is due to an im-
portant device— found only on the “ 1.H.C.”
—and by means of which the engine
is enabled to use very successfully a
low grade of Kerosene costing less than
one-half as much as Gasolene.
The experience of “1.H.C.” Engine
owners has been so satisfactory that
their recommendation has caused far
more of these engines to be sold in
Australia than of any other kind.
Write us the nature of your power
work, and the return post brings you
details of the size and type of “1.H.C.”
Engine best suited to it, together with
descriptive catalogue, prices and terms,
etc.
“1.H.C.” Horizontal Gaso-Kero Engines are built in sizes 4,6, 8, 10, 12. 15
and 20 h.p., and are supplied In both stationary and portable types

Brisbane, August 22, 1914.
My Dear Tiiai:go4iini)Aii, —
The town is still in a ferment of Patriot-
ism. Red Cross meetings flourish, and the
chink of the collecting box is not still by
day, nor by night, nor at cock-crowing, nor
in the dog-watch, nor at any other time.
The Patriotic Ball on Tuesday was a
notable success. The Arthur Morgans and
Mayor and Mayoress Jenkinson were. there,
accompanied by about 350 other citizens.
The supper, mostly contributed, was a sub-
lime rite, and the music (donated by the
perspiring bandsmen) was a tribute of devo-
tion to Empire. The four promoters (Mes-
dames William Collins, Cecil Palmer, E. Iv. *
Tully and Ross Munrof were anpbng the
best-dressed of a fashionable gathering.
Mrs. Collins encased her shin person in
a heavily jetted ninon gown, over black
crgpe de chine. Mrs. E. K. Tully wore rose-
colored chiffon taffetas, shot with gold and
patterned with blurred roses. Mrs. Cecil
Palmer’s fair complexion agreed with her
emerald green gown, and Mrs. Ross Munro
looked handsome in mole crepe de chine.
On Wednesday afternoon the Thespians,
at H. M. Theatre, auctioned some of the
seats for the forthcoming war-chest matinee.
The audience was chiefly remarkable for
its determination not to bid, and had evi-
dently come to hear the free concert that
preceded the sale. Derek Hudson, Olive
Godwin and two of the girls from the
Dandies gave songs, and Jack Cannot got
rid of some convulsively funny imitations
of Caruso, Paul Dufault and Talleur
Andrews. The audience liked this, but when
the business of the afternoon began it either
shrank back coyly into its seat or else
evacuated the trenches.
It seems almost impossible, but of the
£l4O raised in the afternoon only 11 bids
came from the reluctant public. The rest
of the money was stumped up by the
theatricals who were giving the show. I
feel so enraged, Thargomindah, that I could
rush out and attack a German band with
my brolly. I must say that two of the
members of the squatter Anning family,
who were in the stalls* paid up like men,
and between them spent £26 in a few
minutes. The Byrnes, who own the theatre,
gave £45 for the pleasure of sitting in their
own box.
“Princess Caprice” was staged here on
Thursday night by the J. C. Williamson eo.,
for the first time in Australia. The music
is not so enticing as that of many other
musical comedies of recent years, but the
frocking and staging were exquisite. As a
picture, the dainty trifle was wholly success-
ful. Jack Cannot, as the Prince Regent,
and Derek Hudson, as the music master,
were well cast, though one could not help
wishing that the latter had worn less im-
petuous stripes on his trousers, and .had not
arrayed himself in a red velvet coat. A
magenta macintosh would have met the
requirements better. The principal ladies
were Elsie Spain, Dorothy Brunton and
Olive Godwin. All were charming, and,
apart from a weakness for raw onion's at
supper, that is the end of every principal
lady’s desire. Little Novotkna and her
partner gave us a new and uncommon dance,
with the ballet as an effective auxiliary.
Among the parties of the week were a
motor-boat picnic given by Mrs. Costello
Shaw on Tuesday; and tea and edibles by.
Mesdames Rankin (Baroona), Todmann
(M.L.), Johnson (Sydney), and Fletcher
(Eurella).
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

rumor to every square yard. But on the
borders of Russia and eastern Prussia and
eastern Austria there are few roads and few
railways. The tel<feraph is either cut or is
off duty. Now and then a vague whisper
comes to the effect that the Russian has met
his enemy, and planted his great hind foot
on him, and plodded one more stage on his
'road to Berlin, but" detail is scarce* The
Russian is the last man to start fighting and
the last man to leave off. He is slow and
heavy and tremendous. Also he is very
silent. Possibly when the French and British

wanted something to drink, and would burn

"want something to drink in an enemy’s
country it is cheaper to hand down the

The disturbance in Europe appears to have
driven Sydney Telegraph; quite £fine. In
its issue of 24/8/’l4, it placed its fiscal bell-
topper on the ground and deliberately
upended itself and, its hallowed convictions
in these words :
Out of the evil of the war, unspeakable as it may
be, at least one good thing for Australia is likely to
come. The people are getting a valuable lesson in
the virtue of self-help. Hitherto we have been accus-
tomed to rely mostly upon the Old World for making
up our raw materials, and also for providing us with
the bulk of our capital for developmental enterprise.
We now have the European market for metals, wool,
hides, tallow and other products partially closed, and
if the war lasts for any time we may find ourselves
with accumulated stocks Of these commodities, at the
same time a large number of workers out of employ-
ment. There is also in the Commonwealth a consider-
able amount of dry money, for which investment has
to be found. The combination of these facts must
result in the starting of many new industries. And
such industries may, in the natural course of things,
be expected to attract the skill necessary for develop-
ing them to their highest state of perfection. Europe
is now such a comfortable place to be out of that
Australia may expect a large increase of immigration
as soon as the facilities for coming here, which the
wav has interfered with, are again available. And as
there is no part of the world where property is safer, a
corresponding influx of free capital should accomffSSy
it.
And, gazing at the middle-aged, purple-faced
paper, with its spats in the air and the small
change falling out of its pockets and falling
into its whiskers, the staggered spectator
realises that there are only two possible com-
ments. One of them is “Thank God !” and
the other “Good God !”
r ♦
Liberalism lost another chance of display-
ing its well-known sporting spirit, and pro-
duced a fresh example of the futility of the
Party Government game, by ignoring George
■Pearce in connection with its war and
defence preparations. Pearce, distinguish-
ing himself when Defence Minister as a
civilian authority on departmental matters,
gained the respect and confidence of the
forces’ “gilt-spurred roosters” in a manner
probably never approached by any previous
Minister. Australia at large is well aware
of this fact. Liberalism has its own hoggish
idea of the proper thing to do, and is doing
it.
Royal Commissions are futile affairs as a
rule, still there is room for a new one-now
and again. A point on which the patriotic
daily papers are very strong is that em-
ployers should make a great effort to keep
all their “hands” on the salary list, even if
the war has somewhat diminished business.
In the circumstances there might, with some
show of reason, be an inquiry as to the
number of men whom the daily papers have
sacked because the advertisements have
fallen off. According to that lying jade,
Rumor, the number is appalling and the
notice has been shorter than a pig’s tail.
The capture of the “Black” German
steamers Altona (Melbourne) and Ber-
lin (Sydney) brings up the total number
of prizes of war seized in Commonwealth
ports to the respectable number of 23 —-19
cargo steamers and four sailing ships. While
perhaps early to speculate on the ultimate
decision regarding the captured fleet, one
result not outside the realm of possibility is
that the vessels may form the beginning of
the Commonwealth-owned mercantile marine,
which is one of the objects of the Austra-
lian Labor party.
From Edmund Fisher, 369 Collins-street,
Melbourne :
In the Commonwealth’s military college at Dun-
troon the fiery spirit of adventure is suffering consider-
ably from wet blanket. A lot of young officers are
boiling with indignation because they can’t go to the
war as volunteers. That they are being educated at
the Federal Government’s expense for the purpose of
officering an army of defence, which also is not going
to the war, matters nothing to these ardent spirits.
lan Hamilton, when he was leaving the Duntroon
collegians, said: “Well, boys, bloody wars and lots of
promotion!” and they take it for granted that the
war now in Belgium ought to be their job. The
chaps in the first-class ars to go along with four of
the imported officers in charge, as the result, appar-
ently, of a threatened strike. But the juniors will
have to stop at home and scorn the name of Millen,
Minister of Defence. At Duntroon the name of Millen
was Mud even previous to his refusal to let the
school break up and go to European blazes. Which
is not a remarkable fact considering that all the
time he was in office he never visited the college in
his official capacity. And, in any case, “Mud” would
have been an appropriate term of distinction for
Millen, who couldn’t possibly do, or Say, a right
thing in other than a wrong way. It will be a
national calamity if the coming election leaves the
Minister of Offence to resume his duties.
An Elegy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Deceased was of a cheerful disposition. She often
said she wished she was dead.
—Brisbane Courier (19/8/T4).
She was a blithe, dejected miss,
With merry, mournful eye,
And living seemed such doleful bliss,
She laughed, but longed to die.
She wept with joy, and groaned with glee,
And smiled with dismal mirth ;
And melancholy gaiety
Infected her from birth.
The morgue she always much preferred
To pantomime or play ;
In cemeteries she averred
Each grave made her feel gay.
The undertakers’ picnic she
Attended every year,
And chanted dirges joyously,
Qf shed the merry tear.
Alas ! Hooray ! Another sphere
Has claimed this maid perverse,
She’s had her last amusement here:
A -joy-ride in a hearse ! >

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Perhaps when Armageddon has subsided we shall
initiate at last the Reign of Peace.— Brisbane daily.
In Europe’s ancient garden ground
(The sound of marching all around)
We played at building magazines!
Magazines ! Magazines!
We built them broad and thick and high ;
We made them kiss the very sky ;
We stuffed them full of deadly dust
(To show the Lord our hope and trust) ;
We linked them up with wond’rous wire—
(A touch —and all would belch in fire).
We planted mines below— and then
We sang with joy : “Goodwill to Men !
We made ourselves an armed police,
And on the walls we painted “Peace.”
And when we’d used up all our means
We rested on our magazines!
Magazines !
There came a spark from out the sky,
And all was thunder far and nigh ;
The Teuton store was first a-fire, .
The Austrian flamed in menace dire ;
Above the Franco powder-show
You saw a fierce and liellish' glow ;
Then came the Slav—the sport to raise,
And threw a pyrotechnic blaze
Amid the maze of crash and boom
That ushered in the Day of Doom
To hearths and homes —to wives and weans
That slept among the magazines!
Magazines! Magazines!
And when that Hell had smouldered down
To ruins burnt and black and brown;
And We, a handful, lingered on
To tell the tale of what was gone,
We cast aside the skulls and bones,
And gathered sticks and stocks and stones,
And set to work with might and main
To build us magazines again!
For now ’twas doubly clear and plain,
If Peace should come and Right should reign,
The Only Way we could secure
Her sway and lay foundations sure >
Was : Fill the land from east to west
With massive piles where arms could rest,
And ev’ry kind of warlike store
That we had kept in stock before.
And so we chose us kings and queens,
And flags of lovely reds and greens,
And filled anew the spacious scenes
With Magazines!
Magazines ! !
Magazines!!!

By *' ICat-ar-ah” Treatment'
the Nose and Throat are
treated effectively with
Medicated Oxygen inhaled
direct to the afflicted mem-
branes.
**.Kat*ar*ah ** Treatment has
a direct influence upon
the catarrhal poisons of the
body and conquers the
disease by removing the
cause.
Are You a Victim of
CATARRH ?
You know what Catarrh is, with its humiliating and discomfort-
ing symptoms.
A slight cold develops into a stubborn and protracted one, while-
the discharges from the nose are most offensive and annoying.
As the inflammation extends further up into the head and the-
delicate mechanism of the ear is attacked, there is a continual I
buzzing and ringing in the ears, and frequently the-hearing is ;
partially or totally lost. Headaches are almost:constant, with:
sometimes acute pains in the eyes, and the nose- becomes so>
plugged up that the patient must breathe through the mouth,,
while the slimy secretions are forced back into the throat: re-
quiring almost continual hawking and spitting to dislodge tliemi.
At certain stages of the disease the odor of i the breath. beomnes '•
very bad, to the mortification and embarrassment of the suffer-
ers, and the disgust of all who come nearrthefn. Gradually the'
mucous discharge finds its way into the c internali organs, and a
most miserable form of Dyspepsia, or of.[ the Stomach, is)
the inevitable consequence. The blood becomes, contaminated by/
the catarrhal poisons and unhealthy matter, and; these are)
distributed through' the body.
Catarrh is then a deep-seated, dangerous, constitutional or sys-
temic disease, and its effect upon the general health and system
is soon apparent - appetite and strength are gone, weight is lost,
despondency takes the place of confidence, and the disease
frequently settles in some vital organ or terminates in Bronchitis,
Asthma, Neuritis, or dread Consumption.
Trial Bottle of
“Kat-ar-ah” Inhalant
FREE.
A SENSE of satisfaction is experienced
every time one wears a pair of
Bostock boots, and from this con-
sciousness of their fine quality springs a
natural and legitimate pride. One feels
that they will contribute to ease and
elegance on the most exacting occasions,
and one knows that their high quality
will be recognised every time they are
handled. This sense of satisfaction is
the inevitable effect of the choice leather
and beautiful work so conspicuous in
every pair of Bostocks. They are the
cream of imported shoes.
Special shipments have recently arrived at
the leading stores, and ladies should call before
the choicest styles are sold.
C' : ‘ ; \ *;• * * •• " \ • -
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to try a sample bottle of “Kat-ar-
ah” Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic compound of certain valu-
able medicaments, and is supremely beneficial in its influence on the mucous-
membrane. It lias a distinctly soothing, healing and aero-sanative effect,,
sufficient to disintegrate and dislodge the slimy mucous accumulations.
“Kat-ar-ah” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing effects are simply'
marvellous. You can notice an improvement immediately after beginning;
its use. It quickly takes up its work of killing the disease germs, of mini-
mising a*nd eventually stopping the discomforting mucous discharges in;
the nose and throat—mucous that is finding its way into your stomach;
and poisoning your system.
I will supply you with a Trial Bottle of “Kat-ar-ah” Inhalant, FREE OF'
CHARGE, if you will send me your full name and address, together with;
3d. in stamp ’to cover cost of postage. AVrite address plainly, state whether •
Mr., Mrs,, or Miss, and besure to mention this paper. Send for your bottle-

Colin Clout: Please don’t drag the war
into every paragraph. Last week an Abo. item about
a dead snake was the only one in which the dreary
old subject wasn’t mentioned or hinted at
H.S.: Outback some gums live for hundreds of years;
close in to, say, Sydney, about 60 years... .Wowser:
All right; if you object to being called a beginner
we’ll describe you as a plagiarist. The phrases, “My
ambitious effort,” “since I wrote you last,” “from
good authority” and a string of others have been
used by 13,000,000 different writers. If that’s all
you can send along after covering 3000 miles of the
western parts of Queensland give up the pen for the
pickaxe.... J.V.: Your query :
Am I a worm to writhe and squirm
At my country’s earnest call ?
To groan and sigh with sullen eye
Lest discipline’s duties gall?
If you are, you are the only worm that groans The
Bulletin is aware of R.G.H.: “Geographical” not
done well enough.... Arthur S.: You ask us to
“explain what a Constitution and a Beef Trust are.”
Well, a Beef Trust is a combination of business forces
to exploit the public. A Constitution, such as that
of the United States and Australia, is a special invi-
tation to a Beef Trust to get busy.... Grono Park
(U.S.A.) : None worth print. .. .Pom : That’s pro-
hibited... .Larnook: Wliat’s it all about, anyhow?
... .Hogan: Will put the point to some of them....
J. (Sydney): Your bonnie lassie isn’t all the
warld an’ mail - tae u 5.... Walter M.: They are not
worthy of our columns. Our columns marched over
them... .W.R.McA,: Why not wire Willie direct?
If he has any sense at all he will go back to y0u....
Hubert G. L.: Have some doubts about your poem
beginning, “I never was ruined the sad maiden
said.” If she were trying to clear her character it
would be all right, but she seems to be complaining
abdut it.... Harrigan: Outward bound for the basket.
....Unregen: Prosy verse. .. .J.M. (V.): Verse
plainer than an elderly barmaid. .. .Wowseristic
Willie: For full explanation of that poem see 114th
chapter of Job. The point may be a bit obscure to
you, if you are a layman. Any minister should be
able to explain... .Ankarri: But they are not going
to argue with the Allies, you ass !... .Simon S. (V.) :
You must not bite your enemy’s ear—except, of
course, in a financial sense. Disable him in a civil-
ised manner Ethel L.: It doesn’t score Clara
E. M.: “What is this mystic something stealing?”
It is the basket, Clara!.... Kaiser B.: Don’t want
your war-song G.V.L.: Seek out the enemy and
read it to him Ben B.: Don’t care for the gradual
sort of story that begins this way: “On a fine, frosty
morning, in August, 1852, a young man might have
been seen wending his way from the wharf to which
the migrant ship Highland Savage had just tied up,
after a trying passage of 152 days from Liverpool.
This young man” (careful description of young man)
“was no less than the grandfather of John Smith,
the hero of our story.” And, after all, the story is
found to refer to a purely transitory dog that Smith
found in his wash-house in Balmain during the winter
of 1893. Life is too hurried nowadays for this sort
of literature.. . .A.C.D.: But why should you try to
pass such stuff off on an old friend?. . . .H.S.W.: Read
your poem. Stop rotating and have a long drink of
water. .. .C:A.U.: It’s fairly flabby in a literary sense.
B.: ' Unsuitable.... Q. J.: “Flower” isn’t our
sftyle. Why didn’t you attach your name and
address? Edward H.: You write such a difficult
hand that we don’t know what you are saying. We
have an uncomfortable suspicion that it isn’t worth
while trying to find out. .. .M.C.: And neither of them
ever suspected that he or she was the other one who
had run away before he (the third one) had come on
the scene to burst up the life they had led jointly
with each other prior to his hated appearance 1
Surely you don’t expect us to swallow that! If
you don’t, why don’t you set the facts out clearly as
above ? R. 8.: Don’t want the tale Bunyip :
Heavy-footed humor Silvo : Merely a story outline.
L.J.V.: Your manuscript will attend your next
literary at-home if you send a stamp. But why should
you send a stamp? You don’t own a post-office, do
you? Thistle: Let us wait until they are definitely
on the run.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
M.R.8.: Outrages drawn with a fine nib in the
dark by an inartistic savage. You almost demand
a punitive expedition... .R.S.: Strained humor, and
the ’roo is badly drawn... .Arthur T. J.: Ghastly....
K. : Peade is out of order A.S.: Tidy dead
art. ... J.K.: It’s badly applied.
“Gazeeka”: Maoriland Parliament jibbed
on the second reading of the Licensing Bill,
and the clause providing that a 55 per cent,
majority could shut up every pub in the
Isles was cast into oblivion. However the
wowsers immediately rushed into oblivion
after the clause and brought it back, and the
Government was asked to have it re-inserted
in the Bill for further consideration. Alcohol
is apparently aided by Fate, Providence or
some other mysterious power, as the War
has ruined any chance of the elusive clause
being added to the present Bill for final con-
sideration. Contentious legislation is to be
avoided daring the crisis, and there is no-
thing in M.L. that is contentious in the
same wild and woolly way as a Licensing
Biil.
“Moana” : Premier Massey had a hurried
time in Wellington (M.L.) when it became
known that John Bull had decided to get into
the ring in Europe. Everyone in the Pawned
Dominion who had anything he could offer
to the Government, and all those who had
nothing to offer, dashed to the nearest tele-
graph office and rushed Massey with all
kinds of fighting material from motor-cars
to bulldogs and carrier pigeons. The Maoris
danced hakas and shouted: “Kapai te plurry
scra’p!” and then forwarded a long, poeti-
cally-worded wire offering to fight anything
on two legs anywhere. The only people who
weren’t heard from were the anti-defence
crowd, and they had taken to the bush. It
isn’t safe to be anything in lOU Land,
unles's it is anti-German. Anyhow, the
trouble in Europe has made everyone in
Maoriland realise the urgent necessity of a
local navy, plus plenty of land defence. So
even Bill the Kaiser has his uses.

Announcing the New Regal
The ■ four things that make the
successful car are here.
The great motor-buying public has
long desired to get five definite things
in a motor-car at a popular price.
1. A car that will really hold five
people comfortably. The tonneau
doors are full 23 inches, or 58 c/m,
wide and the rear seat is 48 inches, or
122 c/in—with just the right angle for
utmost comfort.
2. Seven years of high reputation
for Regal Motors has been outstripped
in the new Regal—a motor that will
go up the hills and take punishment on
the roughest roads without a quiver.
And the Rushmore Electric Starter, act-
ing directly on the fly wheel, _ is the
simplest, most efficient ever devised.
3. Lightness—Easy Riding—Low
Upkeep. These three are one in the
new Regal. The use of pressed steel
and forgings instead of castings makes
a stronger as well as lighter car.
Less gasoline, smaller tyre bills.
4. Completeness. A full equipment
of every accessory and convenience
necessary to motoring comfort. You’ll
find them all in the new Regal. Regal
brake drums are 12 inches or 31 c/m
almost big enough for a car twice the
size of the Regal.
What Full Equipment of a Regal Means
Rushmore Direct Electric Starter.
Electric Lights with “Dimmer.”
Electric Horn.
Simplified Electric Wiring.
Removable Motor Head.
. Gasoline-Saver Valves.
Extra Size Brakes—l 2 inches or 31 c/m.

48-inch Rear Seat, or 122 c/m.
Adjustable Windshield.

Use Big Ben all day long
Big Ben not only gets you up on
time every morning, but he serves
the whole family all day long as a
reliable clock to tell the right time by.
He’s really two good clocks in one
—an excellent time-keeper and a
splendid alarm.
He can ring you up in the morning
just when you want, and either way
you want —five straight minutes or
every other half minute for all of
ten minutes.
If you’re a light sleeper, turn on
the half-minute taps before you go
to bed. If you sleep heavily set the
five-minute call and you can slumber
then without the get-up worry on
your mind.
Then when you’re up and doing,
carry Big Ben into the living room
so that the whole family can use him
to tell the right time by. He stands
seven inches tall, and his great big
open face can be seen distinctly across
the largest room.
Big Ben is triple nickel-plated and
wears an inner vest of steel that
insures him for life. His big, bold
figures and hands are easy to read
in the dim morning light. His large,
comfortable keys almost wind them-
selves. He rings five minutes steadily
or ten intermittently. If he is oiled
every other year, there is no telling
how long he will last.
Big Ben is made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S.A., by Westclox. His
price is 12/6, postage 1/- extra. If
you cannot find him in your town,
send a money order to the makers’
Australian office, Westclox, 63 Pitt
Street, Sydney. They will have
one mailed to you by the nearest
jeweller.

Truly, these are strenuous days. Even
the London Times was so pushed out of
its old accustomed calm that it issued a
Sunday war edition —three Sunday editions,
in fact. It was the first occasion when the
orderly old paper was too much hustled to
take its umbrella to morning church.

“Union Poet”: The hungry soldier may
put up a poor fight, but it’s the hungry
poet who does the work that makes women
weep and keeps the dusty literary societies
babbling for years. When I have had too
light a lunch and am going home in the
evening with a concave waistcoat and a sick
feeling at the pit of my stomach, my mind
is filled with sad and beautiful thoughts,
and eadenced lines of exquisite pathos swim
before my eyes. Then I get home, have a
comfortable meal, and at once feel so cheer-
ful, that the sad and beautiful poems chim-
ing faintly in the distance merely sound
silly. So I light my pipe and finish up by
writing something cheerful and undignified
about tripe and whiskers, and the immortal
fame that should be mine never arrives.
“Harrison O.”: Katherine Prichard, who
used to run Melbourne Herald’s women’s
page, but for the last few years has been in
the Fog. had a playlet, “For Instance.” put
on by the Actresses’ Franchise League the
other day. It told how a Cold Country fac-
t'ry tart got both a living wage and a vote
by emigrating to Australia. The leading
character, an Australian fact’ry ’and. was
played by Inez Bensusan, late of Sydney.
Katie Prichard made her first appearance
as a stage writer when “The Burglar,” a
one-act piece, was put on at a “Billy”
Moore drama night in Melbourne. The
chances are that the energetic young lady
is at present beseeching London editors to
give her a job as war correspondent. She
tried hard to get to the Balkans when there
was trouble there, but the great Fogtown
dailies unanimously informed her that her
ambition was “most unwomanly.”
“J.F.H.” : Old haunters of the Inky Way
in Melbourne will recall Richard Egan Lee,
who got into trouble more than once for
issuing journals of the pornographic order
—or rather the same journal under different
names. I find him figuring conspicuously
in a book just published in London. “Charles
Dickens in Chancery”—the story of
Dickens’s legal struggles with the fleet of
pirates. Lee was one of the worst, and. the
most truculent of the lot. He reproduced the
“Christmas Carol” in his “Illuminated Lib-
rary” under the slightly altered title of “A
Christmas Ghost Story.” Dickens, furious,
brought him into court, where Lee had the
sublime impudence to allege that he had
“made very considerable improvements” in
the story, and furthermore that Dickens had
cribbed the original idea from his precious
"Illuminated Library.” Of course Lee fell
on his ear. In fact, you might say that
falling on his ear was almost a hobby of
his.
“R.R.T.” : The cable man on a big paper
is probably responsible for more “howlers”
than the rest of the staff put together. And
no. wonder, for he is expected to know every-
thing, from the name of Tottie Highkiek’s
latest. mash to the output of the Feral Feline
mine in Equatoria. Add to which, the reports
are appallingly laconic and sometimes are
mutilated in transmission, so that the cable
man has to guess his way out. When the
English nag Ob won the Canterbury Plate
six or seven years ago, the Westralian papers
fell in badly. The cable ran : “Canterbury
Plate Ob Dean Swift.” Most of the cable
men jumped to the conclusion that Ob was
an abbreviation of “obituary” (cablese for
“passed, out”), and proceeded to kill off all
tin l Swifts they could dig up out of Who’s
Who. The Perth Morning Herald
announced the death of Dean Swift, “the
custodian of the Canterbury Plate”: while
the West Australian had a nice little
obituary notice of Benjamin Swift, the novel-
ist, author of “The Canterbury Plate”;
which was quite correct, except' that Ben-
jamin’s real name is Paterson, he isn’t a
Dean, and he hasn’t written anything about
Canterbury. The worst blunder the writer
ever made while holding down the cables
was in misreading a shipwreck story from
The message started off like
this: “Wreck seen Bishop lighthouse led
launching lifeboats”: and went on to tell
the story of the rescue of crew and pas-
sengers. The writer, not knowing that the
Bishop was a lighthouse, took him for a
portly prelate, and drew an affecting picture
of the heroic bishop leading the' lifeboat
crews to the rescue. As this was in a min-
ing town, where cousin .Tacks were plenti-
ful. the writer heard about his “howler”
later—several times, in fact.

THE MAXIM SILENCER
For Attaching
to RIFLES.
HOW IT WORKS
Improves Your Markmanship.
Ensures Noiseless Shooting.
The Marvel of the (Shooting World.
The use of the MAXIM SILENCER has developed several heretofore
unknown facts regarding shooting. Knowledge of some of these facts will be
found to increase the pleasure of using the Silencer.
The Silencer checks the muzzle blast. Instead of the powder gases being liberated into the
air instantaneously when the bullet emerges from the muzzle, as in the ordinary gun, the gases
are caught by the Silencer.
They are made to whirl around inside the Silencer. This whirling forces the gas to' fly
out from the centre by centrifugal force, leaving a central space, just the same as when water is
whirled around in a set bowl, a hole or space forms in the centre. This leaves the space for the
bullet to make its passage. The gas cannot pass through this space until it slows down. This
causes it to discharge into the atmosphere gradually. This absolutely prevents, report noise and
also reduces recoil over two-thirds:
As the hole in the Silencer is much larger than the bullet the latter does not touch anything
in passing through, and consequently accuracy of flight is just the same whether the Silencer is off
or on.
HOW MUCH IT REDUCES THE NOISE.
The Silencer absolutely annuls all the noise of the report, as can easily be understood from
its construction. It also reduces the recoil over two-thirds. The reason for this is that there is
a very strong tendency for the Silencer to be blown off the end of the gun. This tendency amounts
to a forward pull on the gun barrel. This forward pull counterbalances part of the backward kick
of the gun barrel.
The only noise the Silencer does not control is the noise made out in the air beyond the gun
by a high velocity bullet in its flight. This noise is a “crack” like the crack of a whip and not
a “whistle” or a “shriek” as is commonly supposed. The noise is made in the wake of the
bullet, and is caused by the same thing that causes the air to crack when a whiplash is snapped.

I THINK YOUR REMEDY A FINE ONE
Writes MISS MURIEL STARR.
This Brilliant Actress says she will never again travel
without a bottle of Dr. Sheldon s New Discovery.
Miss Muriel Stark’s appearance in the
American drama “Within the Law” is
one of the sensational successes of the
Australian stage. She has had a wonder-
ful career of star-roles in America. Her
Mary Turner in “Within the Law” has
afforded Australians merely an idea of the
work she is capable of doing. This re-
markable actress writes to the Sheldon
Drug Co., Ltd., as follows:
SHELDON DRUG CO., LTD., Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —
I have been using your Dr. Shel-
don’s New Discovery for the past
week, and, although I have never
given a testimonial for anything before
in all my life, I feel that it is my duty
now to write and tell you what a splendid
Remedy I think Dr. Sheldon’s New Dis-
covery is.
I had such a nasty little cold, and it
bothered me so much and affected my voice
when speaking. I never was so annoyed before,
and I could not seem to get rid of it—some-
times it was a little better and then much
worse. At last I was told to try Dr. Sheldon’s

A Squashed Crisis and Some
Enthusiasm That Didn’t.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The aged Voter relates the story of the stirring
Federal Elections, which were not held in Sep-
tember, 1914.
old man wiped his whiskers as the
I grateful draught went down:
“My blanky oaf! We’ve seen some
wild elections in this town ;
The ’leckshuns in them days ’ud make you
young Australians stare!
I mind the night 'when Bloggs came up and
I was in the chair.
“They’d advertised that meetin’, too, for
weeks and weeks before ;
I mind it well, ’cos it took place the same
week as the War.
You’ve ’eard about that War, of course? It’s
all wrote in a book —
Them ’leckshuns, if I don’t fergit, was on
for Joseph Cook !
“Thanks. I don’t mind another, Mister,
though it seems rather queer.
The beer they gives you nowadays don’t seem
like our old beer... .
Well, as I was a-sayin’, things looked crisis-
like and black,
An’ they told us we’d be ruined if Joe Cook
did not get back !
“Now, it’s strange I disremember wot them
’leckshuns was about,
But I knew that Cook was Premier —’00 the
’Ell was it was 0ut?....
The excitement was tremenjous, as I think I
said afore—
Leastways, it would ha’ been so if it wasn’t
for that War!
“Our candidate, Aloysios Bloggs, could talk
like one o’clock,
But w’en ’e gits into the ’all ’e likewise gits
a shock!
W’y, barrin’ me, as was persidin’—me bein’
the Mayor—
An’ Bloggs hisself, the candidate, there was
on’y one bloke there!
“The bloke sat in the gallery, close ’andy to
a light,
A-readin’ of a noospaper with all his
bloomin’ might.
I looks at Bloggs, an’ ses to ’im: ‘I think
we’d best a’journ.’
‘No, no !’ ’e ses. Tin ’ere to teach w’ile one
man’s ’ere to learn!’....
“Thanks, Mister. .. .fill ’er up agin !. . . .Ah,
Bloggs ’ad lots o’ pluck ;
The War it knocked ’is crisis out —you may
say rotten luck !
The great ’eart of the country, wot should
fill them hempty seats,
Was rushin’ through the town a-talkin’
battles and defeats!
“I told yer Bloggs was plucky, an’ I tell yer
’e could stay!
’E spoke till ’arf-past ten, or so, about the
cornin’ fray—
’E ’arst ’is aujience to arise, an’ vote ’im
strength an’ might,
An’ send Joe Cook right back agin, an’ things
’ud be orl right!
“’E said the present crisis was the greatest
ever known,
An’ if we didn’t vote for Cook it might upset
the Throne—
We must be up an’ doin’ —but I disremem-
-ber who —
And ’e wot shirked ’is juty was a traitor
through an’ through!
“’ls langwids-e was that eloquent, an’ mov-
in’, an’ all that.
I clean forgot I was the Chair, an’ cheered
an’ waved me ’at!
And, every time Bloggs turns to me, I claps
an’ ses “Ear! ’Ear!'
And stamps like mad to make the gallery
get up an’ cheer!
“Not ’im! ’E seemed a wooden man; ’e
’ardly moved at all,
Excop’ to turn ’is paper—which it rustled
through the ’all;
W’en Bloggs sits down, exhausted-like, but
smilin’ still, an’ brave.
The hloke up in the gallery hep' silent as

“I yells to ’im—’e never moves; I waves
and ’oilers “Ere !
A vote of thanks to Mister Bloggs!'....
Thanks, Mister; mine’s a beer....
The bloke up in the gallery ’e puts ’is paper

Just as I waves me ’and agin and catches

“’E came right down into the hall. Ses
Bloggs: "Oi'i was my speech?

’E sorter smiles an’ ses to Bloggs: ‘I don't

“Well, ’ore’s luck. Mister.... Poor, ol*

Enter Rumor Painted Full of
Tongues.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAVE observed during the past weeks
old. respectable and careful Titt-street
Sydney permitting his tongue to wag
ns carelessly as if he were Argent-street of
Broken Hill in 1888, or Hannan-street of
Kalgoorlie in 1595. Those years saw the
height of the booms of silver and. the four-
and five-ounce ore of the Golden Mile —mad
years, with the hope that is the income of
the fool calling the optimist to ruin. Men
ran wildly to one another through hock-deep
dust; touched one another like foraging ants
telling the ant community that there is a
beautiful dead locust just behind that stone;
said “I say,” and in many eases went on
without saying anything. In other eases
they told large and unimportant lies, at the
rate of 200 words to the minute, of IO.OOOoz.
ore at the Great White Lead ; of 50ft. of a
payable lode in the l'otosi, and native silver
by the ton at the Chimborazo and the Moor-
kail. And having screeched and unwit-
tingly perjured themselves they went on to
tell taller stories, leaving a new liar to repeat
the exaggeration at the top of his voice.
I’itt-street, in that first fortnight of war,
might have been the place of the wildest
boom in the most feverish mining camp.
Men who are ordinarily decent citizens lied
like gas-meters.
“There’s been a tumble engagement in the
North Sea," said one well-meaning liar,
and went on to give details of an
“engagement” which had proved so
destructive as to amount to a marriage.
“Thirteen German Dreadnoughts sunk and
eight British—no five British ships—but
there’s been no British lives lost. The Ad-
miral’s Bible was wounded. He carries his
Bible next his heart and a bullet went
through from Genesis to Haboakuk. That
saved his life”. . . .“Yes, I just heard it from
a man in the navy. Fifteen Germans sunk
and eight British —20,000 lives lost. Yes,
in the. North 5ea....1 forget the names of
the ships....but I was told that the Skager
Rack and the Cattegat have both gone
down... .Tumble, isn’t it?.... A mora-
torium is to be declared. Yes! It means
that you don’t have to pay your debts....
I’m goin’ to collect what’s owing to me any-
how. . . .The Australia is engaging four Ger-
man Dreadnoughts at New Britain... .The
Parramatta was spoken by the Bombala off
Cape Moreton. She was looking for the
Condor and the Planet. .. .The ports are all
closed.... They’re searching for a German
ship loaded with war material. She’s in
the harbor now', and the Admiral came back
in the Melbourne to make the search. .. .But
I believe the Seydlitz had the arms and has
cleared out with them. .. .Tumble, isn’t it?”
In an hour the 13 foundered Germans and
the five British ships have increased to 29
and nine, with a loss of 50,000 lives ; and the
Cattegat has been rammed by the Riga Rail-
way ; and the Dogger Bank and the Skager
Rack sank with the crews drawn up in battle
array on the listed decks —5000 men going
down to a watery grave crying “Hoch ! Der
Kaiser” until the sea choked them. Every-
body in the world desires to lead a story-
book life —especially in a time of stress; and
the next best to having had the limelight of a
battle, and having escaped, is the lying
thereof. It also makes new material for the
gaiety of nations, for the noble army of leg-
pullers follows Rumor as she enters painted
full of tongues.
One man in earnest can hold up 100 who
are not in earnest, and Bill holds up men of
all sorts, including naval and military folk
whose faint words of incredulity are silenced
by a confident voice and a bold mien and
details of service which never yet was done
on land or sea, and are too flagrantly manu-
factured to consecrate the dream of any poet
on the green earth —the confident voice and
the bold mien being helped out by the fact
that most men will swear to a lie rather than
admit their ignorance of anything that looks
like fact.
The spoof story of Dreyfus has been done
by Bill ever since the persecuted Frenchman
went to the Devil’s Isle, but he suspended
its continuous performance a few years ago.
When the war arose he began it as a con-
tinuous show 7, and there are men since
returned to Gunnedah, Wagga and other
foreign parts who have taken back to the
bush a new international history.
“What do you think of that sensational
cable just received by the daily papers?”
asks Bill, and five men ask as one: “What
about? When?”
“Just now. You remember the Dreyfus
case?” and they reply, without reference to
the finite character of memory:
“Yes, yes.”
“You remember that Dreyfus was
cashiered from the French Army and then
re-instated and afterwards dismissed again.”
“Yes, yes.”
“You remember that Colonel Dumont
committed suicide in the Hotel du Louvre
nine years ago?”
“Yes, yes.”
“He went to the Hotel du Louvre, and.
being pursued by gendarmes, he suicided to
prevent documents incriminating a British
general in the conspiracy to overthrow the
French Republic falling into the hands of
the authorities.”
“Yes, yes.”
“Before committing suicide he passed the
incriminating documents, which included the
Isidorian Decretals, on to Colonel du Henri
du Paty du Clam. You remember that.”
“Yes, yes.”
“You remember, then, that the British Gov-
ernment denied the complicity of General
George Moore, commanding the fourth army
at Aldershot, in the conspiracy against the
Republic.”
“Wait a minute,” says the retired British
Army officer of the group. “I never heard
of a General George Moore at Aldershot.”
“What! You don’t remember a General
George Moore who commanded the Fourth
Army for nine years?”
The others regard the incredulous officer
as if with sorrow for his ignorance, and
he flushes and hastens to remark that the
name ltad slipped his memory for the time.
“Well, yesterday Count Esterhaz.v and
General Picart drew swords in the Boule-
vard de Sebastopol. Picart having again
alleged French complicity.”
“But”
“Now you remember that the whole Court
of Cassation, including the First Divisional
Court, impugned all the evidence in the
first Dreyfus inquiry regarding the exposi-
tion of the secret dossier and the private
bordereau of Lieutenant-Colonel du Henri
du Paty du Clara.”
“Yes, of course.”
“When the matter was first mooted Lord
Salisbury, then Prime Minister of Britain,
pledged the honor of the British nation
that no British officer was concerned in
the conspiracy against the French nation.”
“Yes.”
“Well, now the incriminating documents,
including the Isidorian Decretals, have
been found on the corpse of Colonel du
Henri du Paty du Clam at 14 Rue Saint

Needs Zamßuk
THE. EVER-READY HEALER.
Every mother realises to-day that a handy pot ot Zam-Buk is a
priceless boon. Zam-Buk is not only world-famous for its heal-
ing. soothing and germ-destroying qualities, but gives us for the
first time an ever-ready “first-aid,'” uniting simplicity, effective-
ness and safetv.
Simplicity. Because it requires no previous preparation
———; ; needs simply to be taken out of the pot
with the clean finger-end and rubbed gentlv over the cut or sore
when the fine juices sink into the, tiny pores in the skin and “<-et
at” the harmful germs that are lodging in the under-tissues. *
Effective. because Za m-Buk is prepared by methods en-
— tirely diifereut and ahead
ot mere ointments and cheap salves or
creams.” Because it is composed of pure
jmces and oils, scientifically refined and skil-
fully combined. The uniform success of
Zam-Buk shows that the ideally effective
balm has been discovered at last.
S&X©. Because Zam-link's active constitu-
________ cuts contain no trace of rancid animal
tat, mineral irritant or poisonous, acid. Because
Zam-Buk achieves its exceptional results
by methods quite different from fatty
ointments and cheap salves. Zam-Buk is
so pure that it suits the frailest invalid
and the youngest habe. It is the one and
only Zam-Buk.
Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk
a daily need ; and its instant ap-
plication on cut, sprain or sore
is a sure safeguard against blood-
poisoning- germ diseases and all
the common complications of ac-
cidents and skin diseases.
A MOTHER PRAISES ZAM-BUK.
Mrs. S. M. Burgess, of 34 Cambridge
Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says: “For
such injuries as cuts, .abrasions and
festered sores, and for children who are
always falling and hurting themselves,
Zam-Buk shcii d be kept on a handy shelf
in every home. For chapped hands and
cracked lips caused by the bitter, winter
winds, Zam-Buk is a splendid remedy.”

A Remarkable Remedy.
Few medicines have met with more favor or accomplished more good than
Chamberlain's Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy.
It has relieved more pain and suffering and saved the lives of more people
than any other preparation in use. One or two doses of it is enough to relieve
an ordinary attack of colic or diarrhoea. It has been used in many epidemics of
dysentery with perfect success.
It relieves bowel complaints in their most severe forms and is especially valu-
able for diarrhoea and summer complaint in children.

bore throat.
You may not look upon it seriously, but a sore throat indicates a
weakness in the bronchial tubes. If neglected it will soon develop into
some chronic complaint. People who are troubled this way are most
susceptible to influenza, contract pneumonia readily, and fall easy victims
to consumption.
To remove this irritation, soothe and heal the inflamed tubes, there is
nothing equal to
Iff
\ COUGH EEMEBY
It gives tone to the weakened tissues of the throat, strengthens the bron-
chial tubes, and at the same time builds up the system. When the throat
is healthy influenza or consumption germs cannot obtain a foothold.
Above all things never neglect a child’s throat for it may mean years of
suffering for it in after life.”

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Devil—and the Woman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BENTON was the devil with women,
lie was also skipper of the steam-
propelled oddity known as the Beauti-
ful Belle. In those days the Amalgamated
Shipping Co. ruled the Fast Coast. To be
sure, there was the Pakeha Parliament at
Ponelce, which made many laws, but it was
a poor thing and without mana —on the
Coast. By virtue of his job Benton was a
person of importance. His whiskers were
the symbol of law without order. He settled
disputes and levied tribute and did many
things which the Pakeha Parliament said
were unrighteous. As a side line, he was
agent of the South Pimlico Missionary
Society.
There was French blood in the veins of
Pita Hilaire —and the blood of many ranga-
tiras. It was this combination which drove
him from the kainga of his boyhood to the
forecastle of a Yankee whaler. There he
encountered the color line —and Gehenna.
Pita saw’ many lands before a tramp steamer
bore him back to his own. He had made
good. His chest contained a mate’s ticket
and the evidence of seven years’ steady sav-
ing. But in his heart there was bitterness
against the Pakeha. Pita had not been
allowed to forget the fact that lie was not
wholly w’hite.
The Belle’s w r as a mixed crew. Ability
to pull an oar in the surf-boat, to keep afloat
wdien the boat couldn’t, and to work 18 out
of the 24 hours, were the requisite qualifi-
cations. Benton and Death thinned out
the weaklings. At the steer-oar Pita Hilaire
was without equal. That fact kept him
his job. There wei'e several reasons why
Benton hated his mate. Not that he showed
his antipathy. But in his own room, remem-
bering the half-caste’s unvoiced scorn, Benton
fed his hatred with promises. Naturally it
thrived. Chief among Pita’s sins was his
handsomeness. For it was that attribute
which had brought him the admiration of
Ngaio, daughter of old Ruapaka, the tohunga
of Tiritiri Bav. Before Pita’s advent Ben-
ton had considered the girl as his—when he
deigned to ask. When realising the drift,
he had sought her, it was too late. Not
all the beatings, which Ruapaka, in his fear
of the potentate, administered, could reform
the recalcitrant. By way of warning Pita
had advised the skipper of his approaching
marriage. Benton had congratulated the
prospective bridegroom.
One day the Belle tied up at Wellington
wharf and Pita went ashore. He had many
purchases to make. It was no ordinary
establishment that the Belle’s mate was going
to set up at Tiritiri Bay. The pride of the
successful lover, and the greater pride of the
successful native, were his. Joy glowed in
the heart of Pita Hilaire. At the tail-end
of a long day Pita climbed the gangway of
the unbeautiful Belle. He was met by two
strangers. It was the old story of broached
cargo. Some of the missing articles had
been found in the room of the chief officer.
His committal for trial at the Supreme
Court was inevitable. There Pita listened
to the very complete evidence for the prose-
cution. In a 15-minutes speech the learned
judge touched on many subjects. Then he
examined the scales of justice Avith a bilious
eye and handed out a sentence of 12 months’
imprisonment. Later Ngaio became as
many of her kind.
* * * *
At 85 Briarly was a failure, with a beau-
tiful AA’ife. In that he had annexed Lillian,
his wife, he was not a complete failure.
Maybe environment was responsible for
Briarly’s non-success. Briarly thought it
Avas. Because he believed the bush to be
lit setting for his ability, and because he
wanted to make good in the eyes of his wife,
the bush lured Briarly. So at 35 he made
a fresh start. He had the moral support
of Lillian, the sought-after. With the last
of his capital Briarly acquired nominal
oAvnership of Matai Bay.
Briarly picked up the burden of a heavy
mortgage —and staggered. If Avas not the
romance he had dreamed, this Avinning a
livelihood from the bush. Part of Matni
Hay was cleared and grassed. Thereon
sheep fed. Most of it was heavy hush.
Kriarly hewed and sawed, under-scrubbed
and burned. At the end of six months the
result was hardly appreciable. Or so it
seemed. If hope did not stimulate Briarly’s
labor, the labor itself was beneficial. Physi-
cally he became a man. In time the con-
quest of the bush brought its own joy. In
Lillian’s case it was different. Viewed from
the deck of the Beautiful Belle Matai Bay
had charmed the aesthete in her. On closer
inspection, the decrepit house and slovenly
menage had at first dismayed and later dis-
gusted her. The Maori help, culled from
the neighboring kainga at Ohau Bay, was
hopeless. And Lillian was no capable
housekeeper, to instil virtue in the virtue-
less. If she did not complain it was because
Briarly buoyed her with false hope. But
the monotonv of the life appalled her. Her
one recreation was riding. Mostly she rode
to Ohau Bay, where the kainga afforded
opportunity to study the brown people in
their native squalor. By way of diversion
Lillian began to learn the Maori language.
Thereafter she was more cheerful. Because
of that Briarly sang as he toiled.
Once a month the Belle’s anchor rattled
down into the sand of Matai Bay. From
the first Benton played to win. Each visit,
he brought books and bundles of newspapers,
and the small-talk of civilisation. lie had
the magnetism of the strong man, and he
knew women. His visits became tin festal
days in the Briarl.vs’ lives. Benton played
with patience. Only at night, when Lillian
sang and her husband dozed, did the hunger
show itself in his eyes. Always lie returned
aboard cursing Briarly, whom he called
friend. In his own room he planned many
schemes. The husband awoke. The cause
was a note of assignation, in a man’s
handwriting. Whilst Briarly raved Lillian
swore her innocence. Benton. whom
she had begun to hate, was importunate.
Briarly cursed himself or his blindness.
Next day. when he returned from the un-
ceasing struggle, his wife was gone.
On the second day Briarly came up willi
the Belle at Ilewa Bay. Behind him. at
intervals, were two blown horses and
many goggle-eyed natives. Whether he
had eaten or slent he did not know —nor
care. As he rode he talked to himself.
C-hieflv the talk was of the revolver which
bulged the pocket of his torn coat.
On the Belle’s deck Briarly faced his
enemy. The first shot went wide. At the
second Benton fell forward, unhurt. Then
half a dozen of the steamer’s crew fell on
Briarly. They bound him securely and
deposited him in an empty cabin.
From the deck of the outward-bound
’Frisco mailboat Lillian, the aesthetic, and her
lover. Pita Ililaire, sometime a fisherman of
Ohau Bay. looked shoreward and speculated
on many things.
W. R. SINCLAIR.
The Travellers’ Hut.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is an old pine hut on an outback run
That the station built for a Shelter
Shed ;
But the men knocked off when the shell was
done
So the hut lacks table, or seats or bed.
Through the yawning gaps in the ten-inch
pines
The moonlight streams o’er the earthen
floor
And the box fire leaps where I sling these
lines
Till the mate comes back from the station
store.
There’s a legion lost have their names dis-
played
On the manuscript of the walls and door;
As a pledge of faith to the same we’ve made
Two names—deep cut with a penknife—
more.
And we glean fresh news from the carvings
rude
That Plunger’s gone to the Castlereagh,
While a hieroglyph on a plank of wood
Says Splinter is breaking for Lockhart way.
It’s a temple frail for the Bush Brigade
From Germanton to the Back o’ Bourke.
It is a sanctuary for the Christs of Trade —
They’ve bred by the pace that the shearers
work.
We dump our swags when the West burns
red,
We lift them up in the dawn and go.
From the old pine hut to the last lone shed,
O’er the long, dry trail that the Bushmen
know.
There are times I have-seen her a blaze of
light,
When the sheds cut out, and the shearers
spelled,
And the bush songs rose on the breast of
night,
And the rafters shook as the chorus swelled.
Derelict, Rover or Toiler find
A welcome warm at the wild bush spree.
For the Blackleg only of all mankind
Does the Shearer treasure an enmity.
I have seen it too in a mantle white-
Of pallid frost in the moonlight glare.
And a suicide in the ghostly light
Hung limply down from the rafters there:
While an old man lay in a corner cold.
Turned out of the hospital to die.
Had it gift of speech could the hut unfold
Strange tales of the plains where the Dead
Men Lie.
Where the heat waves dance o’er the blind-
ing Plain,
And the dust storms swirl from the stock
route brown.
She is Port o’ Storm swinging out again
When we’ve done our dash in the station
town.
When the grass grows damp in the summer
camps,
When the hoar frost pierces the gum’s thick
shade,
