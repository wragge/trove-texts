The Red Page
The Book of Proverbs
In the immortal words of D. H. Stouter,
this Page “counted* one thousand one hun-
dred and ten, and when he woke up he’d to
count them again.” The general impression
is that the Australian does not run to pro-
verbs. Many of the contributors and also
this Page were doubtful about the existence
of any authentically Anzalian proverbs.
“Volumnia” puts the general impression
thus: —
Our picturesque expressions have not had the time
to mature into proverbs. Proverbs are the hoardings
of a past colloquial literature, the treasured and oft-
repeated epigrams of a people no longer able to
produce smart phrases for commonplace expressions.
A producing people mouths no memories. I say
“people” advisedly, for the proverb is the-' peasant’s
epigram. There are no ' authors of proverbs. No
matter where the phrase originates it only becomes
canonised a proverb in the mouths of the people.
If a famous author or best-selling novelist were to
produce an acceptable phrase it would be swamped
in the mass of magazine matter contemporary with
it. The written stuff drifts through the maundering
heads of the, library public producing a slow general
change with the times. It is the spoken word tossed
from mouth to mouth of a. single-minded people that
becomes moulded into the form that later is worth
using as a proverb.
The Australian people is single-minded and apt
with phrases. “From magpie to mopoke” might
have become a proverbial phrase for a working day
but for the Arbitration Court and the I.W.W. destroy-
ing its meaning. How apt we are at phrase-making
our troops abroad are teaching those they come into
contact with.... Put off your competition a century.
The time is not ripe.
And W.S.T. aptly remarks: —
When you come to think of it, Australians do not
run strongly to proverbs—they are too prolific of
speech, and have not time to sit back and dream out
concentrated philosophy. The Jobs of the back
country, boils and all (Barcoo rot) devote their
mental equipment more in the direction of commi-
nation services, and would rather invent new oaths
than proverbs.
But our Jobs do more than curse.
A proverb, as will be seen in the list of
those in general circulation, must be short
and terse. This cuts out probably a third
of the contributions. It must be capable of
universal application : it must embody in a
homely or picturesque phrase a sentiment
common to mankind. “Proverbs are the
economies of conversation” (W.T.C.). Many
competitors made the mistake of submitting
epigrams or aphorisms. Thus “Australia’s
birthright depends on her birth-rate” (Ed-
ward G. Parker), or “A nation can arrive
at greatness only on the wheels of its peram-
bulators” (J.D.C.), or “Love is as spon-
taneous as the chorus of the kookaburra—
and as whimsical” (Ruby C. Pavier) are
clever and epigrammatic, but they are not
proverbs. Parodies of overseas proverbs are
ruled out. “Too many crooks spoil the
course,” or “Where there’s a swill there's a
sway,” though apparently both are somewhat
general, cannot be classed as indigenous.
Many competitors failed to put their excel-
lent ideas pithily ; e.g., “A knowledge of the
track and the distance to the next water is
a poor substitute for a full waterbag” (“Bill
Badd”). An excellent sentiment like “Only
two of us live to the square mile. Bog in!”
(Simon Hickey) is not a proverb: “Bog
in!” may be. “If you leave your cheque in
the . bush pub to be cashed in the morning,
go and earn another for that Sydney trip”
(Steve Hart) is wisdom in too large a
mouthful.
It is impossible to declare that any pro-
verb is original. All proverbs were invented,
originally, by that modest but prolific bloke
“Anon.” No doubt the original of many of
these made-in-Australia proverbs will some
day be found stamped on a brick in the rums
of Babylon, or quoted in the folk-lore of
Thibet. But for the purposes of this com-
petition the entries have been tentatively
divided into five classes: (1) Aboriginal pro-
verbs, Australian and Maori; (21 that
large class of sayings that sum up the ex-
perience of the bloke or the kid Outback.
These while stating a simple fact can have,
and usually have, a wider application, but
seldom a universal application. These say-
ings are classified as Bush Lore; (o) Quo-
tations from the works of Australian poets.
(4) Proverbs already in general Australian
use. Some of these have been submitted by
more than one competitor; (5) Proverbs
manufactured by individuals at this 1 age s
lequest. ABORIGINAL provf.BßS.

Quotations from Our Poets.
The most widely quoted poet is C. J.
Dennis, five competitors forwarding 11 quo-
tations ; though one contributor submits 26
proverbs from the works of Wm. Biock-
sidge. In Dennis’s lot these were twice
backed: —•
’Atiny never paid no dividends.
The common end of most of us is — Tart.
Life’s wot yell make it.
Lawson and Paterson score two quota-
tions each :—•
No matter what a mate may do, a mate can do no
wrong. (Lawson.)
Names have little to do out-back. (Lawson.)
Remember, it’s seldom the pigeon can pick out the
eye of the crow. (Paterson.)
The very best tip of the lot is to watch the com-
mission go on. (Paterson.)
Ogilvie and Gilbert Murray have one quo-
tation apiece, Ogilvie’s being a misquotation
from his “Mulga Maxims,” the point being,
“Never take any man’s dust.” •
Wm. Bloeksidge’s list, submitted by “Me
Judice” contains much thought hut few
proverbs:—
Whatever we take from the skies we find again in
the heart of man.
Look upward, but not off the earth.
Man is possessed by his possessions.
Six foot of earth holds nothing.
Proverbs in General Australian Use.
Many of those submitted are obviously
suspect. “A shut mouth catches no flies”
(F. Saunders and “Mark Lane”), though
especially applicable to Australia, has a
long overseas lineage. “You are barking up
the wrong tree” (G. R. Humble) is probably
of U.S. origin. “It’s a long lane that has no
pub” (E. Cantlon) is an obvious parody.
But the following seem autochthonous: —
Ever'v man’s dog is the best—until judged.
(W. T. Clemans.)
You never know till the numbers go up.
(Maratini Tapa and F. Christie.)
What won’t fatten will fill up. (Used by the
hungry way-backer when the meat develops live
stock or food is otherwise spoiled. G. R. Humble.)
Never go to a goat’s house for wool. (Evidently
an adaptation of “silk-purse—sow’s ear.” “Im-
primatur.”)
Blast it! (“Eve.”)
Take a pull. (When exaggeration is about.)
(0. A. Partlin.)
Your cork’s bobbin’. (When something in con-
versation is to be avoided. C. A. Partlin.)
What’s the use of talking when you’re stony-broke
—and walking? (M. Roche.)
An ounce of kid-stakes is worth a ton of bounce.
(G.W.)
If your neighbor quotes Scripture, brand your
calves early. (X.Y.)
Never throw away dirty water until you have
clean. (Margaret Birmingham.)
These are Outback similes, not proverbs:
As miserable as a bandicoot. (A.G.)
As lousey as a bandicoot.
As cunning, as a dingo.
As noisy as a mob of cockatoos.
As active as a nest of ants.
As slow as a worm.
As fast as a flying doe [kangaroo].
As weird [or melancholy] as a curlew.
As startling as the scream of the giant owl.
As lazy as a cut dog.
(All these by H. W. Ford.)
Manufactured Proverbs.
In the- final class are also included much
Bush Lore that has a wider application, and
proverbs that may already be popular. Our
classification is rough, since many of the
competitors neglected to make it clear
whether their entries were meant to be origi-
nal or not.

The prize is awarded to
“If your neighbor quotes Scripture, brand
your calves early.”
The first competitor to forward this was
“X.Y.,” whose name is A. McDonell, 143
Phillip-street, Sydney.
Arthur Wright, our native Nat Gould,
with a circulation of Australian sporting
stories alleged to be 100,000 copies, is also
alleged to be the best-seller of the N.S.W.
Bookstall Co. He has had ten Australian
novels published, and produces one a year.
These are week-end books, since he has to
earn his living (with the Fort Jackson
Ferry Co.), and support a large family dur-
ing the other days of the week. Frankly he
admits that he turns out the sort of book
that the market demands ; the thing he does
not admit is that he-turns them out. excel-
lently well.' The rewards of sporting litera-
ture in Australia do not, in his case, suffice
to enable him to give up his job and settle
down to literature. This, our best racing
writer, does not go to a racecourse more
than once in 12 months; and the only Nat
Gould's he has read were two novels that he
came across in his boyhood. His latest
novel, The Breed Hold's Good, into which
Wright has put some excellent work, is sell-
ing well. But while his market demands
the sport of l, Arthur
Wright is agreeable to go on supplying it
with racehorses and jockeys. It will be
interesting to note whether his audience
wants anything better —and The Breed
Holds Good is something better.
Gwen Cruiekshank (aged 10) : I did love the tale
about Uncle Billjim. I wonder if it could be made
into a book with the rest of the Bully Australian
Nursery Rimes and sold for the little war orphans.
May Gibbs could draw the Gumnuts (I do love her)
and Lionel Lindsay Billy Bluegum. But I don’t know
who will do the Bunyip. But I think David Low
could, because h 6 used to make such funny things
about poor Mr. Hughes. D. 11. Souter could do
Uncle Billjim well. Normap Lindsay could do the
Kookaburra, but I like May Gibbs’s Jaeky in the Gum-
nut Babies better than Norman Lindsay’s in the
Australian Nursery Rimes. But I don’t like leaving
him out, beeausH he did such good cartoons for Con-
scription in The Bulletin. If you do make a book
don’t leave “Ten Little Rabbits” out.
P.S.—Dad says you will "put this in the W.P.B.
War
After John Masefield's masterly history of
Gallipoli, his new book. The Old Front Line
(Heineinann, per Angus and Robertson,
Sydney), is a modified disappointment. It
is not Masefield’s fault: his colorful and
vibrant style dignifies this book as it did
that other ; but his subject is tamer. Mase-
field has set himself merely to describe, accu-
rately and painstakingly, the old British
front line as it was when the Battle of the
Somme commenced. Useful, as he claims;
but for such a subject a lesser pen would
have sufficed. ‘-All wars end ; even this war
will some day end. and the ruins will be
rebuilt and the field full of death will grow
food, and all this frontier of trouble will be
forgotten. When the trenches are filled in
and the plough has gone over them the
ground will not long keep the look of war.
One summer with its flowers will cover most
of the niin that man can make, and then
these places, from which the driving back of
the enemy began, will be hard indeed to
trace, even with maps....ln a few years’
time, when this war is a romance in memory,
the soldier looking for his battlefield will
find his marks gone.”
Masefield admits that it is difficult to-
describe this line without monotony: he is
tire one man for the task. And “if the
description of this old line be dull to read,
it should be remembered that it was dull to
hold.” But nothing that he writes could be
dull. And throughout it must be remem-
bered that all the advantages of position and
observation were in the enemy's hands, not
in ours. ‘‘They took up their lines when
they were strong and we were weak,” and
“almost in' every part of this old Front our
men had to go up hill to attack.” It is a
desolate picture —this abandoned old posi-
tion ; it is pitted with villages that must
have looked as villages did during the Black
Death. “The village is dead; the grass is
growing in the street: the bells are silent;
the beasts are gone from the byre and the
ghysts from the church. Stealing about
among the ruins and the gardens are the
cats of the village, who have eaten too much
man to fear him, but are now too wild to
come to him.”
The soldiers who held this old front line
saw nothing but grass and wire for many
months. “It was the limit of their world,
the horizon of their landscape, the boun-
dary.” Then came the advance into that
unknown country. “For a moment they saw
the parapet with the wire in front of it, and
began, as they ran, to pick out in their minds
a path through that wire. Then, too often,
to many of them, the grass that they were
crossing flew up in shards and sods and
gleams of fire from the enemy shells, and
those runners never reached the wire, but
saw, perhaps, a flash, and the earth rushing
nearer, and grasses against the sky, and
then saw nothing more at all, for ever and
for ever and for ever.” How bravely and
how gravely beautifully Masefield’s prose
rhythm runs!
It is to help those whose men were killed
in this battle to form an image of that long
graveyard that Masefield writes. It is a
narrative of desolation, “a mass of mud
bedevilled and bewildered. . . .strung and
filthied over with broken bodies and ruined
gear.” And when the shell craters, that have
become pools of filthy water overflow, “a
noise of water rises in that solitude which
'is like the mud and water of the beginning
of the world before any green thing
appeared.”
At some places the parapet of the front
line has been built up by thousands of sand-
bags ; and though Nature has begun to
change those heaps, “they will be there for
ever as a mark of our race. Such monu-
ments must be as lasting as Stonehenge.”
And our improvised line, seldom more than
a couple of sandbags deep, still bears the
impression of having been hurriedly con-
structed by amateurs with few tools. “Like
the old, hurriedly built Long Walls at
Athens, it sufficed, and like the old camps
of Caesar it served, till our men could take
the much finer lines of the enemy.”
This noteworthy book closes with a won-
derful description of the preliminary bom-
bardment before the battle. Readers will
look eagerly for the “account of our people’s
share in the great battle,” with which, Mase-
field hints, this book will be followed.

“Arthur R.”: Australian Nursery Rimes show a
distinct ■ improvement on the imported stuff; and
already “Tinkle, Tinkle, Telephone,” and “Three-
ha’pence for Tuppence” have, to a large extent, re-
placed “The Oat and the Fiddle” with young Aus-
tralia. A significant fact -is that since Aus-
tralian Nursery Rimes has been published a larce
number of old rime books have made their reappear-
ance in the bookshops. Perhaps some of the old
school are iealous of the new arrivals, and are doing
their best for a revival of the ancient stuff.

A MESSAGE OF
9
M these days, when everyone is feeling the pinch of
war-time conditions, and extreme scarcity of many
lines which in the gone by could be purchased
abundance, our immense resources and the big stocks
at the New Palace Emporium go a long way to lessen
the burden of war-time costs.
in
When we quote prices we mean business, but in this
the fourth year of a World War prices cannot stand for
any length of time. After present stocks are exhausted
and new supplies come to hand —bought in many cases
at an increase on to-day’s retail prices in Sydney there
must be still higffer prices. And while these increases
are likely to be considerable, it is probable that innumer-
able lines cannot be duplicated.
The wisdom of buving now will be apparent to all
purchasing future requirements to-dav from stocks that do
not carry the full burden ot war-time costs is an investment
that will prove a profitable one. Our reputation for fail
trading stands behind this statement,

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by _ a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes tlmt awful agonising pain of back-
ache, rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get fid
of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you se.e the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others—you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms, no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

Redland Bay.
Roads of flaring Indian-red lead to Redland
Bay;
Green of bush flanks all the tracks and
scarps down to the sea;
Stradbroke Island purple in the blue and
golden day,
And again comes love aland to storm and
glamor me.
Red roads out from Cleveland on the south
and sea-edged lines,
And Redland’s red road ending in the cool
gloom of the pines.
Green of pine and papaya and banana groves; .
Green of custard apple, and the green of
bunya pine;
Red roads, like to dusted blood, whereon the
swift car moves,
Transilient as the meeting of the blood of me
and thine ;
The island’s jewels in the bay and jewels are
thine eyes,
That change to dewy stars when night and
her thick stars arise.
Red roads coiled in the plantations, through
their green and fecund grace,
As passion coils and ribbons the cold pru-
dence of a man ;
And the red road and the green bush bring
an absent piquant face,
The misty eyes of love, in trouble since the
world began;
And the red road and green forest, these shall
always find a way
To face and form whenever I shall think of
Redland Bay.
The flowing of our river, and the eastern
hills beyond,
The siekled silver reaches curving through
the close-cropped lawn,
Are a memory dear and tender, close and
intimate and fond,
As if we saw the river gilded still by fifes
of dawn;
But the mental eye can visualise, as if ’twere
yesterday, :
Love in the green raths, by the blood-red
roads of Redland Bay.

Nostalgia.
I want the sun-drenched»sea,
The curve of tropic beach,
The palm-fronds flung against the sky,
The lilt of island speech.
The long white coral roads,
The rain-trees overhead,
The clink of anklets in the dusk,
The myriad barefoot tread ;
The sudden tropic rain,
The evis’ breath at night,
The gleaming swords of sugar-cane,
The sense of space and light.
The trams go clanging by,
The motors hoot and screech; '
I want the tropic sky,
The curving island beach.

Youth is too elate to walk,
Speeding out to clasp
Joy that hangs on slender stalk
Ripening for its grasp ;
Foot and horse are ail too slow,
Youth is tempest kinned ;
Like the vapors it must go,
Riding on the wind.
Wind of love or wind of hope,
Wind of poesy
Bridled with a spider’s rope,
Spurning land and sea ;
Age may foot it with a frown
Trudging travel-thinned,
Youth laughs by like thistledown
Riding on the wind.

HOW ABOUT DELIVERING THE
GOODS?
With solemn contempt for humor, Prime
Minister Hughes persists in talking about
his scheme for the “organisation of industry”
on the basis of red tape and Government
billets. The reason for this gaseous per-
formance is, of course, clear. So long as he
blows off hot air about nebulosities he can
let the practical work incidental to his job
slide. The trick of starting a violent argu-
ment about something else instead of sawing
up the wood dates from the birth of the first
loquacious shirker born into a weary world.
If it were possible to take Hughes and his
jaw 7 seriously, there would be justification
for pointing out to him several circumstances
which make all this talk about “organised
industry” sound like a bad joke. It might,
for instance, be mentioned to him that,
though he has had practically a free hand
and an open purse to organise shipbuilding,
the only visible results are slabs of printed
language. It might be shown to him in
simple terms that, after vociferously assert-
ing his intention to organise a scheme of
repatriation, the first elements of the thing
are in a state of chaos so hopeless as to be
a jest from Flanders to Canberra. And he
might be told that the organisation accom-
plished in the Defence Department under his
auspices raised a suspicion in the public
mind that as an organiser he was an ad-
vanced Bolshevik. But to make remarks of
this or any other character in the vicinity of
Hughes is about as useful as remonstrating
with Pearce for being a messer. Both have
the delusion that they can undertake any-
thing and finish it off with triumphant
success are so puffed up with vanity that
the plainest evidence of failure and inepti-
tude only spurs them on to achieve greater
distinction as muddlers and distribute fur-
ther calamity. Having botched the ship-
building business so long that it is just a
question if it now matters 2d. whether any-
thing is done or not, made a ghastly mess
at the Defence office, organised a war policy
into shreds and patches, made some atro-
cious arrangements in relation to metals and
wheat, and set up a hideous record of what
can be accomplished in the way of w 7 aste and
evasion, it is only natural that Hughes
should yearn to try his bungling hand on
fresh material rather than explain why lie
has failed with the old.
The Bulletin is not concerned about
arguing with this little word spinner; but
it suspects that the time is nearly ripe for
the people who are concerned
about the future of Australian industry and
the financial stability of their country, as
distinct from stalling and manoeuvring for
votes, to realise that between the produc-
tion of words and the production of wealth
there is a vast difference; further, that un-
less the issues piling up on the national
doorstep are approached with softie thing
more effective than a mouthful of the dic-
tionary our experiences are going to be very
distressing. The future of the Common-
wealth, so far as the determination of it
rests with the inhabitants, turns upon the
readiness and ability of Australia to produce
things required by the people in this and
other countries. It is no use jabbering
about “our great natural resources” and “the
home market” and all the rest of it if the
capacity to utilise those resources and satisfy
that market is missing. Nor is it much good
expecting that politicians who make hash of
public undertakings and waste the public
credit can be relied upon to do anything but
the same thing over again when they widen
their field of activities. If Australian in-
dustry in the past had been run on the lines
pursued by Hughes in building ships and
Pearce in running an army, the country
would, long ago have been bankrupt and the
people have become paupers. The clear busi-
ness now of the politician is to learn how to
discharge the job he is paid for with reason-
able efficiency and give the people oppor-
tunity to make good on the actual work of
wealth-production. And the duty of the
people is to impress upon the politician that
unless he does this he will be fired out. The
spectacle of Parliaments notoriously incom-
petent to discharge their legitimate func-
tions, and of Ministries convicted over and
over again of the grossest ineptitude, maun-
dering about organising industry and simul-
taneously refusing to give the people the
chance to do some organising for themselves,
is enough to cause wonderment to a gohanna.
* * * *
If the Federal Ministry, instead of giving
sanction to the eternal talk of the Hughes
rdgime, would explain why it does not
organise a working policy for tropical Aus-
tralia, and why it omits to mend the leaks
in the cashbox, and why it cannot discover
what is meant by repatriation or shipbuilding
and numerous other things, Australia would
have something to be thankful for. And if,
after having made these explanations, the
Ministry proceeded to take off its' coat and
tidy up, and while the job was proceeding
announced that it had no time to waste talk-
ing about other things, there would be some.-
thing to say for it. But a:- Government
which does none of these things—which allows
the whole national outfit to : drift off down
stream, hustles the tariff away into the bush,
and through the mouth of a windy time-
server burbles a mass of verbal camouflage to
cover up its administrative and political
nakedness —this is no ordinary sort of
menace. The tragedy of the thing is that
an at least considerable section of the people
know this to be so, and yet are content to
see nearly everything that counts in the
national life either side-tracked or made the
sport of an agile tongue.
AT PISTOL RANGE.
The American troops are armed with automatic
pistols, which they have been using with deadly
effect in recent raids.
Four years ago it would have' seemed almost
impossible to any person who had been
watching the mighty war preparations of
the nations that troops should ever again
come to such close quarters as to make the
use of a pistol possible. The tremendous
range of the guns, the increasing perfection
of the rifle, the development of the far-seeing
aeroplane, and a hundred other thihgsj''4l^ :
seemed to point to the fact that Efiropeanj|
battles would be long-distance affairs, with,
death leaping out of a cloudless sky and
men facing mysterious powers that were
unseen and almost unheard. The first war-
wind on the Western Front blew the whole
notion away. The great guns roared muzzle
to muzzle, the trenches were dug within
speaking distance, and the rifle became often
of less account than a well-aimed' jam-tin
full of explosives. Knee to knee and hand
to hand the millions of the nations have
wrestled amid an uproar such as.the world
never before heard. The idea that troops
could not approach guns or come on in the
open against rifle-fire was a mere' dream of
the parade-ground, where there is more
stupidity than almost anywhere else in the
world. The new weapons were as deadly
as any had supposed, but the / chances of
attackers getting through even the most con-
centrated fire had been under-estimated. The
decision of the field has rested with the
actual fighters to a far greater extent than
could have been believed; and now 7 it is
quite possible that before the year has run
its course the automatic pistol may prove to*-
be the most valuable weapon in the whole
armory of death. For that automatic
pistol" is really a miniature machine-gun
for use at closest range; and once it has
been proved that the enemy may really come
through the fire to a point where the thing
will hit him, it looks a lot more valuable
than the whirling jam-tin or the anarchistic
bombs w 7 hich had hitherto held pride of place
in trench raids. “As men shorten their
weapons they increase their dominions”
passed as an axiom in days, when war was
a glorified football match; and it may be
that a pistol can blast the w 7 ay to peace
more surely than a fifteen-inch howitzer.
* * * *.
But the closeness of the modern war-
i range has an application of a sterner sort
than any mere consideration of the inches
of the weapons could suggest. In the old
days kings and Prime Ministers fought long-
drawn-out campaigns at a range which meant
absolute personal safety for the real war-
makers. The armies fought, the nations
looked on and hooted or applauded; but
nobody ever seriously 7 thought that a war
could get up against a throne or thrust
explosives into a Cabinet Council. In very
old days, of course, kings and their friends
did get right into the thick of the turmoil,
partly for sheer love of the excitement and
partly from the antiquated notion that it
was really a king’s job to be in the most
dangerous spot in defence of the rights or
ambitions of the mob over which he ruled.
But such ideas had long gone by 7 the board.
The person who threw down the glove in
the wars of the last century or two took very
little risk. He might be about when a battle
was being fought; but he was always on
the other side of the hill. The same thing
applied in a general way to the ruling upper
class. A few of the younger members of the
top families got into the mess because it was
a fine adventure and a great game; but
nobody forced the war upon them and they
could take the glory and blood or leave it
just as they pleased. Now all is changed.
The conflict is at pistol range ; not only has
The' war~iTorfor “swept right through the
homes and hearts of London, Paris and
Berlin, but it lias struck and struck hard at
places as distant from the scenes of action
as Vancouver and Balmain. Nations are
really fighting whisker to whisker as they
never fought at any previous time. A Ger-
man submarine torpedoes violently the
breakfast-table of a retired linen-draper at
Hampstead, and on the rebound hits a picnic
party in a glen near Katoomba. The rifle-
fire that crackles along the hill-slopes beyond
Ypres makes holes in hearts as widely sun-
dered as Cornwall and Collingwood. Modern
war, as the huge game is being played to-
day, has wiped out distance and brought us
all into absolute touch with the ruin. But
in a still more deadly sense the war gets
right up against those who make and wage
it from what was once a skin-safe distance.
The splendid vision of the Kaiser dangling
from a rope urges on the rank and file of the
Allied peoples to fresh sacrifices ; no doubt
the people who hunger in Berlin have as
cheerful a fancy about the ultimate finish of
the British Prime Minister or President
Wilson. The great capitals are actually
at grips, and the men who hold the battle-
pens are pushed, willingly or unwillingly,
right into the firing-line.
All this is at once strangely disquieting
and strangely suggestive. A German raider
was near Sydney the other day with an
areoplane which might easily enough have
been employed to drop bombs on the missing
mailbags at the G.P.O. A German trader
is at this very moment preparing silent
bombs with a view to a grand raid on the
wealth of Australia. We are in the world
firing-line as really as if explosives were
tearing up-the pavements of Collins-street;
and- the automatic pistol is never many feet
awhy from our easily-moving jaws. The
only pleasant suggestion of the close and
tangled fight is that once the fighting is over-
men will never allow their real enemies to
get to close quarters again ; the disquieting
side of the whole thing lies in the fact that
the fight is so near and so bitter that an
alleged peace will not end it. but that the
close-range rage of strife .will go on after
the doves have roosted. The enemy knows
us all as he never knew us before, and may
be expected to take the fullest advantage of
that knowledge. The straight and direct
remedy would seem to be the automatic
pistol. That weapon is a distinctly citizen
affair. It is made not only for close fighting
but for personal fighting. The voting power
of an elector of the Commonwealth is, in
point of fact, his automatic pistol—the thing
that stands for his own personal defence and
for the best fight he can put up when the
enemy comes right at him. The big guns of
the seven Parliaments of Australia may
roar, the machine-guns of office may splut-
ter, there may be a more or less effective
political rifle-fire; but when it comes to the
last and the trenches are really endangered,
the automatic pistol which operates through
the ballot-box is the most important weapon.
Australia is in very great danger. Our big
guns are almost silenced, the machine-gun
fire is badly directed and the rifles are
mostly aimed at points that matter nothing.
114 is the moment when, if the country is. to
-be saved, the citizen pistols in a million
hands must begin to speak. We have trusted
the larger machinery and the more power-
ful-looking weapons, and as a result the foe
is sw r arming all over No Man’s Land. Democ-
racy as a fighting weapon was subverted
when the war flames, started, and a sort of
despotism has been established for the
alleged purpose of winning the war. It is
not winning the war —not winning any of
the wars, military, economic or moral —and
despotism having failed, it is necessary for
sheer national existence to give freedom and
democracy a show again. We are at pistol-
range from verv fearful things, and we must
go under unless eacli individual citizen stays
the enemy rush by his own efforts. The
other fellow, in whom we trusted, has ceased
thinking and fighting for us; we must think
and fight hard for ourselves.
FINLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The little Finnish boat, nearly a week out
of Hull, slugged along at five-knot speed
through a channel marked by stakes, some-
times edging so close to the spruce-clad
islands that the tall trees seemed to tower
over its decks. Even with the sun shining
brightly the air had a tang of cold in it,
as though it had blown off fields of ice.
Blue water r- sparkled, and among the
sombre green of tile firs and spruces showed
the red-roofed chalets of the rich people from
Helsingfors who make this archipelago
their summer playground.
We were bound for Abo. on the west coast
of Finland, and had to thread through the
80 miles of stakes that make the passage
like a narrow canal. The crowded decks of
the little tub were piled with the belongings
of returning emigrants, mostly young men
whose felt hats, wide trousers and knobby-
toed shoes spoke of the Chicago department-
store. They were over-well provided
with mouth-organs and concertinas, and the
air vibrated with discordant noises and
sounds of jubilation in a strange, harsh
tongue, oddly flavored with Yankee slang.
They were going home to Finland, but to
one traveller, at least, that did not seem
anything to make a song about.
That was before a world-war had
taught geography to suburban grocers.
Finland had been associated in my
own mind with snow and reindeers,
and it was surprising when the little
tub edged into the wharf of this unknown
port to see an electric-car waiting, and all
the other appurtenances of civilised life,
such as advertisements of liver-pills and
soap. Indeed, the only primitive things in
evidence were the heavy, wooden houses and
the manners of the Russian officials, who
ransacked our belongings for firearms and
seditious literature and bullied us about our
passports. But even this seemed more novel
then than it would to-day. The powers of
government broaden slowly down from pre-
cedent to precedent.
Finland, instead of being an isolated
region of eternal snow, is a very up-to-date
country indeed. The towns have that aspect
of bright modernity that seems to go with
electric-light. All over the southern part
of the country there are endless chains of
lakes and cataracts, and the quiet of the
spruce-clad hills is broken by .the whirring
of countless dynamos. Cheap electric-power
has scattered industry all over the country-
side and brought the cost of production
down to a minimum. There is probably no
country in Europe where the ordinary com-
forts of modern life are so widely distri-
buted and so cheap. The equivalent of a
couple of shillings will procure you a
spacious room in one of the big hotels in
Helsingfors, with hot baths handy, electric
light and a telephone at your bedside. True
cheapness is not the only good, and it may
be merely relative, after all: but there is
no denying that cheap power is a good basis
for industry.
Whatever the figures may say, Finland
gives the stranger an impression of unosten-
tatious comfort and prosperity. Travelling
about in trains one is conscious of a certain
mental alertness on the part of the people,«
especially those of Swedish blood. The book-
stalls flare with cheap translations of the
literature of all countries, modern England
being chiefly represented by Conan Doyle,
Jerome and W. W. Jacobs. Bright, aggres-
sive women in felt hats, eyeglasses and
tailored clothes pursue you with questions
about your own remote country, correcting
your facts when you romance and keeping
you firmly tethered to solid realities. They
were the only Europeans who five years ago
betrayed more than a fugitive interest in this
end of the earth, perhaps because they also
are conscious of being new. For they are new
in all essentials, at any rate, these smart,
efficient women who fill the banks, the post
offices and the civil service, and venture
gaily into the muddy waters of politics.
Sitting on the busy boulevard of Helsing-
fors, watching the stream of afternoon traffic
pass by, you forget about the pictures of
reindeers in the schoolbooks. There cer-
tainly is a winter here, but it is hardly as
severe as that of Canada, and is alleviated
generally by a hard, bright sun. There was
no reason to doubt the Finnish journalist
who shared my cabin on the boat and told
me he was going home because he could not
stand the London climate. On the boule-
vard here in summer there is as brave a
show as anywhere in the world. People
promenade to see and be seen: there are
comfortable seats under the trees, and talk
and music floats over from the cafes on the
sidewalks. Yet underneath there is always
the assurance that the crowd is not merely
a leisured and fashionable one —that it knows
about work and business as well as the art
of playing peacock in the sun.
It is the tragedy of Finland that it has
hitherto been split into three parts. It
takes three languages, Finnish, Swedish and
Russian, to keep people from spitting on the
pavements or leaning against carriage-doors.
The old Finnish stock is of Mongolian
origin and still carries traces of the brown
buttonhole eye and the clear, oily skin. From
this race come the sailors, who are alleged
on every sea to have the power of casting
spells over heavy-fisted bo’suns or bringing
up storms at the wrong moment. What the
superstition derives from it would be hard
to say. Perhaps from the fact that Finns
are not a gregarious folk, but are distri-
buted singly, like black cats, over the ships
of the world. On land, at any rate, they
are a likeable people, hospitable and kindly.
The bourgeoisie are mainly Swedish-
speaking, and under the old regime the
official language was Russian. Now
Swedish and Finnish languages have to fight
for mastery. Thus there is more- than an
element of racial war in the battle between
Red Guards and White. The White Guards,
whose defeat in arms is always sympatheti-
cally described in the cables as a “mas-
sacre,” consist mainly of Swedish-speaking
students and young men of the upper classes
who have had training in the German army-
It is absurd to suppose that they have any
friendship for us. What unites them
is their autocratic and military con-
tempt for the working-class Finns. But the
difference in language does not altogether
correspond to the difference in blood.
Swedish is the language a Finn dons when
some aptitude for business or increase m
wealth carries him into middle-class snon-
bery. , *
For some time in Helsingfors 1 stajea
with a little saddler from Marquette,
U.S.A., who was a member of the older
race. We had been thrown together W
accident for a few days and he had msis e
on taking me home with him.. Though
and his wife had lived for six years in
America, and the three children were bo
there, he - alone could speak English,
short, heavily-built man, with brown ey s
and a quiet manner, he talked at gre
length in the evenings about his mtner
and his father’s father, pursuing an honest
family of woodcutters nearly back to
days of Gustavus Vasa. But when n.


talked of the future there was always the
same queer note of irony : .
•• \h yes, the Swedish bourgeois will help
us get’ rid of the Russians. But who then
will protect our rights against the Swedish
bourgeois?” . , , _ ,
No one, of course —unless it be the Red
Guards. The Finnish Republic is born into
a world that is not so liberal and humane
as it used to believe in the old, sentimental
days. The struggle for self-preservation has
left the air harsh and raw, and there is no
sympathy for the fledgling until it can show
the color of its feathers. The new republics
will have to come into being fully equipped
for the fight or perish in the nest.
VANCE PALMER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
John Redmond.
Gone to Heaven, John Edward Redmond,
leader of the Irish Parliamentary party, and
-sane, forceful voice of Ireland for nearly a
generation. The fierce agitation during the
leadership of Parnell forced upon Glad-
stone and his English Liberals the neces-
sity for dealing with the Home Rule ques-
tion ; but it was the long constitutional
struggle, maintained with quiet tenacity by
Redmond, that caused the measure to be at
last placed on the Statute Book. Red-
mond’s fine contempt for the noisy vapor-
ings of that cheap person, Edward Carson,
and his reliance upon the British sense of
fair play, made him the ideal leader for a
cause that was no longer a forlorn hope.
Then the war came: all things were thrown
into the melting-pot again; and Carson, by
much noise, exalted himself in the eyes of
the Nortiicliffe press and secured, under
cover of the German guns, what he had pre-
viously yelled his intent of getting by
treason. Redmond agreed to the postpone-
ment of Home Rule until after the war. His
loyalty to the cause of freedom led him into
what turned out to be a fatal mistake; for
behind him rose the Sinn Fein movement —
a reckless outburst on the part of a nation
which was convinced that. it had once more
been tricked, and that England never could
be trusted to play the game. Some of Ire-
land’s contempt for the bargain-breakers over
the water made Redmond its target; and,
dying, he told Father Bernard Vaughan
that his heart was broken. It might well have
been. In all the long succession of Irish
leaders this man had most nearly achieved
success. His life-work resembles that of
Henry Grattan, to whom in his personal
loyalty to constitutional methods he was
also spiritually akin. Both men saw Irish
freedom an apparently accomplished fact;
and both saw the prize snatched away by
forces over which they had no control. What
Redmond’s place may be in history it is
hard to even guess; but if the love and
esteem of his countrymen and the hearty
respect of his bitterest foes is any guide, he
will • be remembered everlastingly as a great
and good man.

Fat Animals and War Bonds.
One of the arguments used against the pro-
posal to prevent local prices for meat con-
tinuing above export prices is that, if the
grower cannot get more for a jumbuck sold
for consumption in Australia than for a
similar animal destined for mastication in
London, he will “find it more profitable to
keep his stock for the wool.” In some cases
where the breeder is under-stocked this may
be so. But so far as the argument applies
to the majority of properties from which
sheep are turned off for the knife, it is un-
true. The difference between the price
for stores and fats, calculated on the
price realised for export, is much too sub-
stantial to induce the proprietor to retain the
meat on the off-chance of losing it while
waiting for a growth of wool. If the argu-
ment had any serious force, how comes it
that, in spite of the allegedly ruinous prices
given for export, sheep have been pushed
forward for the freezer in. increasing num-
bers? The indisputable fact in relation to
the sale of animals in the bulk is that the
market is stripped by the export buyers at
a relatively low figure, or forced up by bids
fiom export interests whenever the local
seller of flesh comes in. The business has
been brought to a pretty fine point, and,
though there are various terms by which it
may be described, “fair competition” is not
one of them. That it “pays” many people
to see mutton sold at famine rates cannot be
doubted. But it will certainly not pay a
Government to let the general population be
thus fleeced. The state of mind in which some
of the defenders of a system which makes
the export of meat a means by which the
local inhabitant can be squeezed was quaintly
illustrated the other day when an infuriated
dealer proclaimed that “interference” would
mean disaster to the War Loan and calamity
to the finances of Australia. How it helps
national finance or the War Loan for a
citizen to sell a carcase of meat cheaper to
someone who will send it out of the country
than to an individual prepared to consume
it on the spot is a problem that could only
be answered in Heaven. As a general thing
this paper views the official price-fixer and
all his works with sour mistrust; but the
absence of this individual from the neighbor-
hood of the leg of mutton is no reason why
Private Enterprise should be allowed to block
the small-saver from buying a War Bond.
This consideration may possibly serve to
keep Hughes's feet warm, though he seemed
to be looking round for a funk hole the other
day.
Reprisals.
Before the war has run its course civilisa-
tion will be painfully interested in the philo-
sophy, morality and practical value of what
are called Reprisals. The word means many
things. From a medical point of view the
next-morning headache is Nature’s mildest
reprisal. A parson suggests that pangs of
conscience, are reprisals on the evildoer, and
that Hell is the last reprisal of all. Nemesis
is the representative reprisal-monger, as a
reasoning world understands the word. But
in Germany, which isn’t reasonable, the
word was impudently Teutonised at the
very outset of the war. When the crews
of only a few British merchantmen had been
murdered in cold blood by Hun cruisers, the
British Admiralty announced that any cap-
tured pirate crews would not be treated with
the consideration shown to ordinary naval
prisoners who had not been concerned in
acts contrary to accepted rules of warfare.
Then was the moral flabbiness of the
Asquitii Government revealed. Germany
threatened “reprisals” on certain aristo-
cratic English prisoners who had been cap-
tured at the Battle of Mons: if a distinction
was to be made in British treatment of
naval prisoners, said the Chancellor of the
Kaiser, special “punishment” would be in-
flicted on a selected dozen lords held captive
in Germany. Whereupon aristocratic and
pro-German influences paralysed the will of
the British Government and over-ruled the
nation’s sense of fair play. A proper and
crushing reply to the German bluff would
have been a threat to do unto German non-
combatants in England what the Huns were
doing to British non-combatants on the seas;
and the word “reprisals” would, .have been
dropped by the Kaiser like hot coal. At
that time, and for months afterwards, the
balance of power as regards prisoners was
in favor of the Huns, hut with a long war
ahead of them they would hardly have dared
to raise a cry of “No quarter.” Now that
the balance has turned decisively against
them they talk no more of reprisals on our
men in prison camps. They reserve the word
for the intimidation of other combatants in
a weaker position. As for instance: —
The Paris newspaper llomme Libre states that 1000
hostages were selected from prominent French people,
including refined girls, taken from their homes and
sent to Holzminden camp as a reprisal for air raids on
German towns. They were exposed to scandalous
treatment. When 30 of the girls refused to make
sacks for the enemy they were locked up without
food and light for over a month, and the mattresses
and bedclothes, and even their woollen underclothing,
were taken away from them. They were only
released when a Spanish inspector arrived on a visit
to the camp. The Germans attempted to hide the
outrage, but the inspector learnt the facts.
Here is an exasperating illustration of the
German pretensions to enjoy a monopoly
of aerial offensives. With childlike faith in
the efficacy of his Zeppelins the Kaiser
started the war on the assumption that if he
was not promptly victorious in the field he
could rain down sufficient destruction on
enemy towns, far behind the lines, to set the
populace whining for peace on German
terms. Hun airmen were dropping bombs
on open towns almost as soon as the first
design on Paris had failed. The German intro-
duced Frightfulness from the air as a new
and unimpeachable system of warfare. But
with the advent of the airmen who could
drop bombs on German towns, as the Zep-
pelins had dropped them on enemy, towns,
came the Ilun-hog grunt of “Reprisals!”
Having possession of nearly a third of
France the Huns can put their bully threats
into action, and will continue to do so (call-
ing their victims “hostages”) until them-
selves are bombed into submission. English-
speaking countries continue to acquiesce,
practically, in this Hun system of putting
the screw on their civilian captives, though
it might be promptly checked by a counter-
move. Germany openly professes to regard
this as a' war of nations in which the
Hymn of Hate is its war song. But we —-
well, Hamlet might have said of us: —
We, dull and muddy mettled people, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of our cause,
And can say nothing.
We are waiting, it seems, for the Americans
to come with a fleet of aeroplanes and a
backing of hard commonsense to teach the
Huns what “reprisals” really mean. The
logical answer to Zeppelins is to be uttered
by the one combatant country that never
came within Count Zeppelin’s dream of
Frightfulness in the days, not so long ago,
when the Kaiser publicly extolled the blood-
thirsty bladder-maker as the greatest Ger-
man of the Age.

Brown Brother and the Annexation
Mania.
Possibly on account of reluctance to throw
clods at the doctrine of self-determination,
questions of a practical nature regarding the
German colonies are for the present being
carefully shooed off the stage of public dis-
cussion. The explanation is, of course, that
these questions raise others that are infern-
ally difficult. But in Maoriland the local
statesman is not going to stand any non-
sense from the German or anyone else, and
he has about as much time for self-determi-
nation as for cheap butter. For his part,
Massey strongly contends that Maoriland
is entitled to “have” Samoa because “our
boys took possession of it” ; while Joseph
Ward has his Imperial eye on Fiji, and
declares that he will fight to the very
utmost “the proposal to hand Fiji over to
Australia, because the natural country for
those islands to be attached to is this.” So
far as Australia is concerned, the all-con-
quering Maorilander can have Fiji. Aus-
tralia lias quite a big enough job on hand
without being cumbered with a group of
islands 1200 miles away. Meantime, how-
ever. it appears to this paper that the black
man’s cry of “Fiji for the Fijians,” if inter-
preted in terms of the self-determination
war-aim, is entitled to considerably more
respect than the yearning of Ward and
Massey to do a bit of diplomatic filibuster-
ing. And “Samoa for the Samoans” has at
least as respectable a sound as “Belgium for
the Belgians.” To look upon the decorative
citizen of Hapaii and Levuka as the German
looks upon the neighboring Slav implies sen-
timents that are specifically disowned in
every rational statement of Allied war
aims, and gives a lead in the direction of
plunder in the Pacific which the most vital
interests of Australia demand should have
no countenance. If there is any justification
at all for the British occupation of Fiji it is
that this occupancy is merely a preliminary
to self-government by the local people. To
say they are unfit for the task is rubbish —
and hypocritical rubbish, which is worse.
The fact is that Fiji has been “held” for
the exploitation of the Fijians’ land and
India’s labor —the latter so gross an out-
rage upon the peoples of India that it is
now stopped. Unless Maorilanders have a
hankering to perpetuate this double exploita-
tion in some form or other and pine for
getting tangled up in more war, what do
they want to “have” Fiji and Samoa for,
anyhow ?
Ghosts and “Other Causes.”
The 'Senate committee appointed in Mel-
bourne to consider the alcohol traffic in its
relation to the army accidentally roused up
a ghost which wasn’t on the bill of fare.
The Drink Curse is one of the recognised
assets of parsondom, and a certain pleasant
atmosphere of wowserism breathed round the
proceedings until a military witness drifted
away to the subject of syphilis and venereal
diseases in general. This is a matter on
which wowserism preserves considerable
silence, save in vague allusions. The
young are not informed about it because it
would be rude to do so, nor warned how to
avoid it lest the bloom should thereby be
rubbed off their ignorance—otherwise
described as innocence. Therefore it didn’t
seem strictly in accordance with the intent
of the bill of lading when a testifier stated
that, so far as could be estimated from the
examination of recruits, one-fifth of the male
population of Melbourne suffered from vene-
real complaints. Now it wasn’t alleged that
Melbourne is worse than other cities, and
seeing that the worst cases of disease weren’t
likely to volunteer and thus come under the
notice of the military doctors, it is probable
that the one-fifth was an under-estimate. It
was added that syphilis was vastly more
important than beer, and that so far as the
Victorian camp figures went the great
majority of the diseased (60 or TO per cent.)
were teetotallers or very moderate drinkers.
When a comparison is made between dipso-
mania and syphilis the latter wins the race
easily. No teetotaller need fall down in
the street with a bad hiccup because his fore-
bears w r ere consumers of wet goods, but the
most moral teetotaller may be a monstrosity
—deaf or dumb or blind, more or less im-
becile, stunted and otherwise reoulsive —
because of the razzles of the man before him
in company with Raiiabs who died ere he
was born. And even if his ancestors had a
clean bill of healtn and he himself has
abjured Rahab or managed to avoid the
consequences which her name suggests,
venerea] disease can be acquired at second
hand even by children, in infected baths or
lavatories, by the use of infected towels, and
in a multitude of other ways, and the conse-
quences may last in greater or less degree
for life. The man who occasionally wears
whisky-leaves in his hair may be quite wel-
come in society; but nobody welcomes the
syphilitic subject save through ignorance.
Any private hosnital will take in the hard
drinker if he can pay his way and has no
worse cnarge against him; and the most
meddlesome wowser will take him by the
hand and call him his poor fallen brother.
The sufferer from synhilis has to herd with
his kind in a place of his own lest he should
contaminate the drunk; and the average
wowser, if he has a concern for his health,
regards him from a safe distance. Further-
more, the drinker is a diminishing evil,
while the victim of contagious disease is
suspected of being, until recently, on the
increase. Perhaps he is still on the increase.
Taking all points into account there was
justification for raising at the Senate’s drink
inquiry the srhost which wasn’t exactly in
the catalogue. Tnere are two spectres that
especially haunt the white races, and the
fact that it is generally considered imnelite
to even allude to the worse of the pair has
caused a world of misery. Even some Gov-
ernment Statisticians describe it among the
deaths as “other causes.” These men will
probably put the present war among “other
causes.”
The Government Appoints Another
Commission.
It almost looks as if the procrastinating
creature at the top of Federal affairs has
got into such a state of mind that he
couldn’t chase a strange dog out of his
garden without first appointing a royal com-
mission to inquire as to
(1) Whose dog it is.
(2) What breed it is.
(3) How it got into the garden.
(4) How long it intended to remain there.
(5) Its object in coming.
(6) What plans, if any, it had made for providing
a means of retirement.
(7) Its reason for being a dog.
(8) Any other matters relating or pertaining to
the dog that may arise.
In pursuit of his usual habit, Hughes has
appointed Chief Justice Griffith, a busy
man with his own work to attend to, as a
Commissioner to “examine the records of
the Defence Department”— Pearce’s De-
partment, which has already been examined
and denounced in three reports, two of
which, at time of writing, remain unpub-
lished. Also —and this is where the supreme
jest comes in— -Griffith is to state “the
number of reinforcements that should be
embarked monthly.” Of course, if Griffith
is to decide this point according to the in-
formation derived from an overhaul of the
tangled Defence records, it will be some time
before lie can say to a split hair how many
men should be sent monthly, even if he sus-
pends his proper work entirely. It is as if
he was sent in great haste to Adelaide via
Papua. By the time he reports the great
battle in Flanders may be over and done
with. Further, the report, whether it comes
to-morrow or next year will never be worth
much, for no one can tell how many gaps
there will be to fill after next battle or any
other battle. Also the Lord only knows how
many gaps there are in the Defence Depart-
ment’s information. But meanwhile the Pro-
crastinator can postpone the work of finding
recruits on the plea that he is awaiting the
results of the Commissioner. In his utter
lack of the organising faculty the Stipendiary
Delayer finds it as hard to get a recruit as
to get a ship. In the part of the Man Who
Doesn’t Know How he is without a rival.
If, however, Hughes must set another man
(whose job it isn’t) to find out what he
(whose job it is) ought to know, then The
Bulletin suggests this obvious proceeding:
('ll Appoint Griffith to ascertain how many
recruits are wanted.
(2) Meanwhile make a rough estimate of the
number required.
(3) Send that number.
(4) If Griffith decides that more should have
been 'sent, then make up the deficiency.
(5) If Griffith says that fewer would have done,
remark that it is a darned good thing we left a
margin. , . ,
(0) Shake hands with Griffith and wind up the
Commission, charging the cost of it to loans.
When the Gorillas Came to Paradise.
The Iluns have done a wholesale bombard-
ment of Venice from the air, and presum-
ably they will come again and again, unless
the Allies dispose of their air fleet, till the
queen city of the Adriatic is a pile, ot ruins.
Venice appealed to the Ilun instinct. It
was unfortified and ungarrisoned, because
it lias been understood for many years that
an undefended city was exempt from bom-
bardment and fire and sack and other forms
of military destruction. The Italians had
a passionate desire to save their
paradise from the horrors of war. To tear
down its ancient glories in order to make
barricades was sacrilege, and to undermine
12 centuries of marvellous history in order
to dig trenches seemed an act worthy or
perdition. So Venice took its chance and
relied on the usages of civilised nations, and
the Hun came to it like any other orang-
outang coming to any other masterpiece ot
art, and put his great coarse paw through
it. He gained nothing except the pleasure
of breakage and the satisfaction of being a
Hun, as he always has been. Venice knew
him of old. It was Hun territory for some-
thing like 60 years, and no place has more
cause to remember the blessedness of
“kultur.” In Venice within the time of
people still living, ladies were arrested and
imprisoned for systematically staying away
from the theatre. It was well known that
they stayed away because Austrian officers
swarmed at the theatre, and the dames of
Venice objected to seeing them, objected to
surrendering their seats to them on demand,
and objected to rising as a mark of respect
when ' some great Austrian potentate
entered. Men were similarly treated; also
they were flogged or shot for not saluting
private Hun soldiers in the street, and if
a Venetian gentleman and his daughter met
an Austrian officer, and the Hun had a
fancy to kiss the daughter, the father
objected at. his peril. In those days the
Austrian prisons were full of Italian
“political offenders,” and though the sur-
vivors wbre supposed to be released when
the Hun was chased out of Venice in
1866-67 it is suspected that numbers
remained unaccounted for. All of which
was strictly in order —Hun order. The
same sort of thing, including the flogging
of the girls and women of Sydney and Mel-
bourne and Australia in general, will hap-
pen here if the war goes utterly wrong from
any cause —perhaps through famine among
the Allies, largely contributed to by a Gov-
ernment Which Won’t Build Ships to carry
our six or seven or eight million tons of
surplus food to the place where it is so
badly wanted. It is a peculiarity of the
Hun that wherever he has conquered another
race he has been loathed at the beginning
and loathed to the end. He has made no
friend in the wide world. As late as the
middle of last century one of the petty half-
Austrian princes of northern Italy, finding
it advisable to flee from his loving subjects,
had all his political prisoners, who in-
cluded the best of his people, first flogged
and then shot, after which he bolted with a
carpet-bag and a light heart. There was
only one public Hun whom Italy ever
regretted— Maximilian, brother of the late
emperor Francis Joseph, known as the
“Son of the Gallows.” Maximilian, as
viceroy of Austrian Italy, showed himself
an insufficient flogger and a very poor hang-
man. He was recalled by the infuriated
Son of the Gallows, and lost all his employ-
ments. Then, by devious devices, this weak
vain man with much pomp and whiskers
was induced to be a candidate for the billet
of Emperor of Mexico. He was a puppet
set up by bis brother and Napoleon 111.
and supported by foreign troops. He could
neither rule well nor fight well. When the
Republicans of Mexico captured him after
a bitter war they tried him on a charge
of “pretending to be an emperor,” and not
being Huns they only shot him politely
against a wall. And the verdict of Venice
was that he was a good sort of man—for a
Hun —and a very bad poet.
A Department of Commerce.
Tiiep,e were voluble persons and institutions
before W. M. Hughes, which is a blessing,
for it saves the Commonwealth the disgrace
of being the inventor of unlimited conversa-
tion. Boanerges (in the Scripture)
might be quoted; also Chadband and the
Shepherd, and the wild waves which dis-
coursed to Little Dombey (Dickens) ;
Talkative (Bunyan), Bartoline Saddle-
tree (Scott), the Cockatoo (Aboriginalities
column), the brook (Tennyson), Jawbone
Neild (N.S.W. Hansard), and Skakke the
Long Winded (Norse legend). Still,
Hughes takes a high place. For instance,
this is part of a recent column of verbiage
about the new department he proposes to
create: —
Its function is not to produce ( anything except
expenses and reports), but to consider (Diogenes in
his tub was a great considerer) and advise ( advice is
cheap and generally bad ) upon all the circumstances
of the industry (whether it be belltoppers or cocoanuts
or boots or agricultural implements), including pro-
duction, distribution, sale and finance ( which pre-
sumably means a loan and a deficit). The Associa-
tion will ascertain exactly the position of the in-
dustry in relation to home and foreign markets (it
must hurry, for the position isn’t nailed down and
is always changing), promote its welfare, encourage
its development (a blessed word like Mesopotamia),
assist the individual to produce at the lowest mini-
mum of cost ( not the highest minimum , please
observe), and dispose of his product ( such as wheat
and rabbits) so as to give the best return. The (1)
Association will act (with the same velocity as
Hughes's shipbuilding job) through (2) its council,
which will be directly in touch with (3) the General
Council of Science and Industry, composed of repre-
sentatives from all industries, and (4) the Depart-
ment of Commerce and Industry under the presidency
of (5) the Minister for Commerce and Industry (it
suggests five deadbeats sitting close together for
warmth).

How Yankee Labor Sees It.
From the address of Frank J. Hayes,
President of the United Mine Workers of
the U.S.A.. at the biennial conference at
Indianapolis:—
Shall we be found wanting in this present emer-
gency? There can be but one answer by free men, and
let us in this convention firmly resolve that every atom
of energy we can contribute to the winning of the
war will be given gladly, freely, and in the same
loyal spirit as those who go out to give their lives,
if need be, for the peace, freedom and security of
the civilised world. Let there be no mistake about
this war and its relation to the great humanitarian
movement in which we are engaged. It must be
evident to every close observer that the triumph of
the Central Powers means the menace of militarism
throughout the ages—means a world in turmoil and
agony for centuries to come. What chance would
labor have against the edicts and pronunciamentos
of military autocracy? A philosophy based upon the
right of a few to rule and conquer can find no place
in the minds of liberty-loving men. It is a matter of
particular pride that approximately 20,000 members
of our organisation have enlisted in the military
forces of our nation. Our hearts go with them across
the sea, and we know that these heroes of ours,
who have faced the perils of the mines year in and year
out, will not be found wanting when they face the
foreign foe. While we are earnestly desirous of
peace, wo recognise that it is unattainable as long
as the German emperor and his cohorts seek to
dominate and force upon the world the creed that
might makes right.
And let there be no doubt about the charac-
ter of this Miners’ Federation. Of these men
the radical Public of N’York —a paper so
revolutionary that it usually talks of “the
conservative Bulletin” —lately said :
These are the men who bought rifles in the open
market, issued a call to arms, and then forced
ItocKEKELiiKR’s gunmen to sue for truce in the days
following Ludlow. They are the men who have
increased coal production by 50,000,000 tons, and
who would have produced the other 50,000,000 tons
of excess required this year if cars had been forth-
coming. They are men who can fight industrial
tyranny in America and Prussian militarism in the
world at the same time, men who can and will
nullify a medieval Supreme Court decision and whip
tftill other industrial autocrats here at home while
lending valiant aid in the struggle against a Euro-
pean manifestation of the same dark forces. They
are the men who compose our greatest labor organ-
isation, our one great union organised on industrial
lines.
Dark Shadows.
Far more important than the news received
lately about the resumption of fighting on
the Western Front was the report of a
speech made in the House of Commons at
the end of last week by Bonar Law. It
seems to this paper that he was preparing
the public to hear about the evacua-
tion of Salonica, and probably also some-
thing different about the campaign over
beyond Jerusalem and Bagdad. Whether
the Allies can continue to feed the army at
and around Salonica, and whether they
could reinforce it to carry on against an
enemy offensive of any magnitude, have for
a long time been problems to which the
answers of officialdom have not been very
cheerful. What appears to be reasonably cer-
tain now is (1) that the collapse of Russia
and Roumania in the North have made the
Salonica enterprise futile; (2) that if the
army at Salonica is withdrawn the position
in Palestine and Mesopotamia will have to
be reconsidered. Bonar Law appears
anxious to have this noticed, and, though
he tries to dilute his language by mention-
ing that it had never been hoped to make
the Mesopotamian campaign “decisive”
unless transport was uninterrupted, the bed-
rock of the thing is that transport is inter-
rupted. Though we are no doubt entitled
to feel comfortable about the great German
attack alleged to be pending on the barbed
wire in France and Flanders, it would be
foolish to overlook the patent fact that else-
where Germany has every reason to be satis-
fied. And this, too, it would be foolish to
overlook: from the first Berlin has turned
its eyes towards the Black Sea, Asia Minor
and the Indian Ocean. The Western Front
is much, but it is not all. Tremendous in-
terests elsewhere are at stake. Among other
things, Australia is at stake. Germany’s
face is turned this way. If the Allies are
defeated on the Western Front anything
may happen anywhere else.

From the outset the Defence Department
has made poor use of the professional men
of Australia, medical men perhaps excluded.
There are in this country some of the best
engineers and chemists in the world; but
though they have been in most cases anxious
to put their highly-trained services at the
disposal of the nation, they have had the
greatest difficulty in getting any recognition
of their special qualifications. Recently an
Order was issued that no more army commis-
sions would be granted in Australia. Gener-
ally speaking, the decision is a good one ; it was
little less than a scandal that men with no
special qualifications, but with social influ-
ence, should he permitted to hang about for
a year or so preparing themselves for a job
which could be much more safely entrusted
to men who had climbed up from the ranks
in active service. But it is both absurd and
wasteful that this Order should apply t»
men who have taken their professional know-
ledge and experience as engineers into the
Engineers’ Training School. To pack them
off as N.C.O.’s or sappers is no more ridi-
culous than it would be to first invite surgeon
Alexander MacCormick into the Army
Medical Corps and then send him away as a
stretcher-bearer.
♦
Wonderful how deeply the Freetrader has
to think before lending a hand to Australian
manufactures. Minister Millen is going to
inquire into the woollen industry—appar-
ently after 23 years of political life it is
still a closed book to him —as an occupation
for returned soldiers. But he holds that it
would be “criminal to train returned
soldiers to an industry unless there was a
reasonable assurance that there would be a
steady demand in the established industry
for their labor.” Well, the raw material is
here. No country is better supplied. , The
demand is here, for Australians wear clothes.
If Millen can’t see how to bring the
demand and the supply together when they
are living next door to each other and pass
each other in the street every day, his salary
is wasted. Certainly there is the loony War
Profits Act, which levies a special war tax
of 75 per cent, of his profits on any man
who starts a new woollen factory ito use
Australian material and employ Australian
labor, and this, with other taxes, about
absorbs all the earnings, perhaps part of the
capital as well. Then the duty on imported
woollens doesn’t nearly counterbalance the
higher wages and shorter hours in Australia
as compared with some of its competitors.
Apart from these things, what is there for
Millen to inquire into? Why shouldn’t he
give his cubic yard of brain a rest?
From the Gallery :
Hughes asks for nothing better than Irvine’s con-
tinued advocacy of Conscription. Whilst the Iceberg
pursues the topic he is hardening the feeling for
Hughes among the Nationalist waverers who, in any
other circumstances, would be looking kindly in his
direction. Irvine’s attitude is achieving no benefit
for the community and is arousing the sort of irrita-
tion which finds relief in personal recrimination
and suspicions of honorable motives. You will now
get insinuations about Irvine’s designs on the Prime
Minister’s salary. You will also hear a vast revival
of the scoff that a man possessing a safe seat, who
has contributed comparatively nothing in blood and
treasure to the Great Cause he advocates, and still
further enjoys life without any visible shrinking of
personal pleasures, is not fitted to lecture the com-
munity on patriotic conduct. The gibe is no less
stinging because it is equally applicable to other
members of Iceberg’s party. Pearce, Groom, Web-
ster, Watt and Glynn—to mention five of the
Cabinet alone—resemble Irvine in having no son at
the Front, and, also like him, are not suffering
the shortage of fox-age and income that afflicts many
thousands of worthier Australians. . Contrast the
theatrical discoui-ses of those whole-hog Conscription-
ists with the quit* conviction of conscientious but
mistaken voluntarists like Tudor, Chai'ltou, Peter
Bowling and other Laborites who have sent all
their eligibles to the conflict, and you get all the
disparity between Bathos and Pathos, totem-worship
and the Christian religion. Yet Iceberg and those
others still consider themselves qualified to rule the
country that has ignominiously rejected the principle
they stand for. Indeed, far from resigning to
show an honest man’s indignation with a hopeless
position, Irvine has become associated with a rebel-
lious and mentally negligible Nationalist corner that
can only shift Hughes with the help of Tudor’s squad.
If Irvine has any sense of humor, he surely cannot
help smiling. The situation is soaked in irony.
“F.K.E.” : There is a rather bad historical
blunder in the finding of the Vic. Leg. Coun-
cil in the Sachse case. The members state
that the city of Halle, as far as they could
find out, belonged to the kingdom, of Saxony
before 1815. It never had any connection
whatever with that Saxony. From 965 to
1648 Halle was under the powerful arch-
bishops of Magdeburg, who held vast terri-
tories as secular lords. In 1648, at the
Peace of Westphalia, the archbishopric (and
with it Halle) was merged with Prussia
(then termed Brandenburg). With the ex-
ception of the period 1807-14, when Halle
was included in the short-lived kingdom of
Westphalia, the city has been under Hohen-
zollern control since Luther’s time, as even
five of the last six archbishops were princes
of that family, and they resided at Halle,
which has always been an ultra-Prussian
place. The confusion re Saxony is due to
the fact that Halle is situated in the Prus-
sian Province of Saxony.
Leslie Stuart, of the Lincoln Stuart pro-
prietary, bought up the premises which his
firm occupies in Flinders-street, Melbourne,
the other day, together with Bradshaw’s
Business College adjoining. He had to pay
£B5O a foot for it—£so,ooo for the 00ft.
Truth is stranger than fiction, and a great
deal more probable. Witness this from
Sydney Telegraph’s summary (8/3/T8) :
The Australian Cup was won by Defence at 6 to 1.
The time was 3min. 59sec.
Mr. Ball is hopeful of pushing on with it.
Ball is a sort of Minister for Public Works,
and in the general rage for useless inter-
ference he is evidently going to run behind
that horse next time.
“V.” tries his hand at prophecy:—
A few more days and the numbers will go up for
the Bananaland elections. The Labor party will be
returned, probably with an even more unwieldy
majority than at present. Of the seats at present
held by Labor, Townsville, Charters Towers, Windsor,
Enoggera, Bulimba, Ipswich, Bremer and Merthyr
are likely to prove troublesome. As against those
possible losses is placed the winning look of Logan,
Carnarvon, Burke, Mirani, Nundah, Rosewood, Cun-
ningham and Lockyer. Flinders will, of course, go
to Labor, ex-Senator John Mullan being the holder
of the endorsement for the pub-strewn electorate. At
the jump off there were going to be about 20 three-
cornered contests, but the Nationalists cracked the
whip and the hounds came to heel. On nomination-
day there were nine electorates with more than a
party pair, but final acceptances saw the number
down to five, and before the start it’s likely that two
more will have bowed to the Party joss. It is an
uninteresting campaign. Labor is trading on its
record, which is positively brilliant alongside the
inaction of Hughes in the Federal arena. Liberal-
ism, or “Nationalism” as it has camouflaged itself, is
casting suspicions on Ryan and Fihelly, and in an
ashamed manner is making sporadic attempts to blow
the wind of life into the skeleton of Win-the-War.
But Liberalism or Nationalism is so hopelessly in-
capable and tremendously unintelligent, if the elec-
tors can judge by the candidates, that Labor will win.
It may even be a debacle.
The Commission appointed to inquire into
the business side of the Defence Department
last week had a taste of what the press of Aus-
tralia has had to put up with for three years
and more. The members having submitted their
report, the document was passed on by the
Minister to certain officers, presumably those
who were responsible for whatever further
muddles have been disclosed; and those
officers having rfeplied, telling the Commis-
sion that it dididt know its job, the report
was returned to the Commission. Chairman
Mcßeath’s answer came promptly: after pro-
testing against the grossly improper course
adopted by the Government, he said that the
Commission declined to do any sub-editing.
In the case of a newspaper, of course, though
it may be as absolutely sure of its facts as
this Commission is, it is simply told : “This
article is untrue and its publication is pro-
hibited.” There are times when the Depart-
ment is foolish enough to add some observa-
tions of its own; and if the observations
made to the Commission are as unconvincing
as those usually made to the press, it isn’t
surprising that the Commission merely
snorted. Even that consolation isn’t allowed
the newspapers, the Department’s reply
being always “confidential and not for pub-
lication.”
“Bows” adds his protest:—
Apparently in reply to a request by the Merchant
Service Guild of Australia that Australian masters
and officers be employed in Commonwealth-owned
vessels, Sydney D.T. states that Prime Minister
Hughes says “it has not yet been determined whether
or not the vessels now building in America shall be
manned by Australian seamen.” As the present
Commonwealth-owned fleet of 15 vessels can boast of
only one Australian master and five officers, out of
a total of 50 or thereabouts, the chances of Aus-
tralians finding berths in the fleet now under con-
struction seem remote. On every side we hear of
the shortage of certificated men to man purely
British vessels; yet we have a Government here
drawing from the undermanned British vessels and
fleet to the detriment of good Australians, many of
whom, having wives, families and Australian homes,
cannot go abroad to look for employment.
When the numbers went up in connection
with a by-election at Wellington (M.L.) the
other day Premier Massey ascended to a
high place with a view to making a few
well-chosen remarks about the joy of the
Government at getting its man in on a
minority vote. But the assembled prole-
tariat had no time for Bill, and raised loud
yells of wrath and counted him out and
otherwise misconducted itself. Whereupon
Massey did what Prime Ministers usually
restrain themselves from doing. Putting his
thumb to his nose he publicly waggled his
fingers at the multitude and gracefully took
himself off. The interpretation put upon
this weird performance is that William in-
tended the masses to understand that he was
determined to carry on the war to the bitter
end and would make vulgar gestures in
Berlin at the finish.

‘‘Mrs. Dot,” Somerset Maugham’s genial
comedy presented at Sydney Criterion last
week, may be described as First Aid to
Widows. When a charming relict wants a
particular man, she has usually learnt enough
of the gentle art to use the right bait —and
plenty of it. In Mrs. Dot’s case the odds
are all in her favor: the victim hasn’t a
chance. She is fabulously rich, being a
beer-widow, young, vivacious, pretty. Also
her victim is in love with her, though, unfor-
tunately, engaged to another girl. Add a
nice man who falls in love with the
girl; and a managing mother’s pertinacity,
even when aided by the hero’s absurd sense
of honor, is doomed to defeat. Believing that
the young man, poor but of course allied to
the aristocracy, is in love with her, Mrs. Dot
Worthley proposes to him. Then comes the
disclosure that he has become engaged to
marry a flapper. He is on the point of escap-
ing this bond, owing to his poverty, when
he suddenly inherits a title and vast estates.
Naturally the girl’s mother won’t let him go.
The smart comedy’s climax is given away in
the first act: everybody knows that when
Mrs. Dot wants a husband she is going to
get him—and there will be no doubt about it
if she has the help of brilliant Marie
Tempest. The only fresh interest in the
slight comedy lies in the methods by which
the widow marks down her prey. Every
widow in Sydney should take a First Aid
course at the Criterion.
* * * *
The comedy is packed with wit, though
humor is lacking; and one character, desig-
nated as a cynic, delivers himself of much
cheap snarling. But in the third act a
perfectly ludicrous, almost farcical, scene is
inserted, in which the old cynic, ordered by
Mrs. Dot to make love to her, for her own
fell purposes, and implored to put more ardor
into his make-believe, convinces her that he
really is in love with her. That, and the
succeeding scene, where Mrs. Dot, having
“MRS. DOT,” AT SYDNEY CRITERION
Blenkinsop (Graham Browne) declares his
bogus passion to Mrs. Dot (Marie Tempest).
discovered that he is pulling her leg, pulls
his in turn, are screamingly funny burlesques
of stage love-making. (Stage love-making is
funny enough, anyhow.)
* * * *
Marie Tempest brings to the characterisa-
tion of Mrs. Dot her wealth of finished
comedy. She repeats herself sometimes,
especially in her gestures and vocal
inflexions; but what actress, appearing in
such a range of quite similar characters,
wouldn’t? Graham Browne nobly sacrifices
his personality by making a quiet cameo of
the elderly cynic. The inestimable conse-
quence is that the burlesque love-making in
the third act is presented by two great artists
in pure comedy. lan Maclaren, as the
worried hero, does fairly well as that unsat-
isfactory individual. He has little to do
but to scowl and clench his hands, and he
scowls and clenches nobly. As an ingenuous
youth Roger Barry is to be congratulated
upon his study of calf-love. Though she does
well enough, Nancye Stewart does not help
him very much. Ethel Morrison is admir-

“Aladdin” must have had to rub the Lamp
hard and pay the Slave of the Ring over-
time to crowd the big Tait-Bailey show into
Sydney Palace, which wasn’t designed tor
such proceedings. But spite of being somewhat
cramped, the panto, keeps bright and busy in
a battery of costumes through 19 scenes, and
will crowd the little theatre for weeks.
There is enough of the simple old nursery
yarn left to swear by, and when money is
dashed about by Aladdin it is minted com
by the bagful. This will show the bright
modern kid that it isn’t Yank crookadrama
and belongs to the golden age before the
war. Barry Lupino, droll and acrobatic,
cleverly plays Abanazar, a brisk, bald pill-
fakir who sells medicine by the (bass) drum
and patters into some censored Oriental place
invented by the Clints, to sing and dance
.with the distinctively European Widow
Twankey, who is “Dad” Bailey, strangely
subdued and fashionably dressed. The virile
personality of the Australian actor cannot
be obscured altogether by his various dis-
guises and feminine tricks ; but lie does his
absurd job well. When he settles himself
m a loose wrapper to do some shewing, how
motherly he looks! A parody of “Going
Home” is artistically sung, and advertises
the fact that Dad knows how to use his
deep voice.
* * * *
Singing isn’t the strong point of either
Lalla de Baere (Prince Pekoe) or Winifred
i.a France (Aladdin). They get through
with good looks, costumes and the dashing
air that goes with tights. Olive Godwin
(Princess Badroulbadourl is a gracious
spectacle and a clear voice singing in the
painted wilderness. Higginson makes a
good-looking but husky Emperor, and, later
on, an ideal young Admiral. Fayette Perry
(Nieee) is a delightful big-little girl in the
well-contrived toyshop scene, and Leslie
Donaghev is joyouslv inane in a grinning
part. Zola Terrell, the temperamental
young person who can make her white arms
wriggle like powdered snakes, does two in-
teresting dances and makes a classic final
appearance at bouquet time in a sort of
draped Greek robe. Bonnie Quinlan hits the
joyous note in her solo dance, anu the sup-
porting ballet girls do their duty gracefully.
Florence and Alice Wilson and Lucie Oluff
are acrobatic in their revels. The comedy
scene, where the Widow Twankey’s kitchen
is wrecked by the renovators and the smallest
plumber is forced to sit on the burst water-
pipe, goes with a rush and a yell, and makes
all the grown-up kids regret that the harle-
quinade can’t be done at night.

When “Within the Law” was first pro-
duced at Melbourne Royal there was more
powder and shot in Muriel Starr’s voice
than is there nowadays. Outside of her voice
Miss Starr has no dramatic force to speak
of. She can’t strike a lone attitude on the
stage and thrill the house with a couple of
glances. She doesn’t cut a strikingly pic-
turesque figure in action or repose. Her
husky voice has ever been her all-important
asset, and it is most valuable in rapid repeti-
tion. Muriel can say “I do, I do, I do” or
“I don’t, I don’t, I don’t” as effectively as any
actress. Also she can catch her breath
between utterances, and speak with a sob in
her throat as convincingly as any. But her
tone has weakened, and some of the previous
outburst of indignation in her appeal to
Gilder, the Emporium boss, is wanting in
the revived effort. In both the climax to the
first act, where she threatens vengeance on
the bloated business man, and the climax to
the second act, where she proclaims her pos-
session of his offspring and his name, Miss
Starr was less strong than of yore. In minor-
details of naturalism she was a little more
adept last Saturday night. Two of the other
characters- —Aggie and Lawyer Demarest—
were more fully played by Miss Norma
Mitchell and Frank Harvey. Kimball, too,
made an admirably fresh and ingenuous
young Gilder, and was weak only in the
absurd burglarv scene, where he has to sit
on a couch and talk love to his soiled dove
whilst four crooks are standing silent in the
background waiting for the intruder’s pre-
sence to be explained. Styan is a larger and
more majestic Dad Gilder than his prede-
cessor, and George Bryant is _an entirely
new edition of Burke, the police-inspector.
When Piumer took the part the Inspector
was like a huge, arrogant Yankee drummer,
seeking whom he might ruin in the lag
trade. His tricks for entrapping suspects
appeared contemptible because he never
struck a note of human sympathy himself.
He put the police in a worse light than the
crooks. Bryant reverses the position. His
Inspector Burke has notions of benevolence
as far as a policeman can entertain them,
and although he knocks a crook down in his
office he doesn't play the brute in his manner
of bluffing a confession of murder out of Joe
Garson. Stage-manager Morrison has put
three more coats of melodramatic color on
his picture of hysterical Joe without making
it look less artificial. Harold Moran, as the
“stool pigeon,” utterly fails to account for
the value that Burke attached to his services,
and James Hughes presents Sergeant
“YOU’RE IN LOVE,” HER MAJESTY’S,
MELBOURNE.
Percy Pinklove the boatswain (Field
Fisher) tells Aloysius Wix (Alfred
Frith) the sad story of his life.
Cassidy as a.would-be funny man, rather
than a cold, morose cop. The whole effect
of “Within the Law” is considerably altered
by these changes of cast. Perhaps a com-
plete reproduction of the old show would
have been less interesting Ho the multitude
that remembers it.

The revival of “You’re in Love” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s reminds this writer of
“Lady Frederick,” the charming comedy
that Ethel Irving introduced to Australia.
When Paradine Fouldes had come a long
journey to visit his sister he consumed a lot
of dinner and promptly forgot it. His valet
assured him that he had chosen much food
from the menu. Paradine merely remarked:
“Strange; it has left *0 impression.”
“You’re in Love” is like Uncle Paradine’s
dinner. It leaves no impression. One swal-
lows the performance and forgets what it
was all about. The present revival reminds
one that a ridiculous marriage contract was
the only pretence of a plot, and that Maud
Fane’s slippers were, in a way of speaking,
transferred to the entertainment’s feet of
clay. Chorus and ballet (especially Madge
Elliott as solo dancer) serve to distract
public attention from the hollowness of
Connie Ediss’s claim to lay down inhuman
rules for Maud Fane’s hbneymoon. For the
rest there are the principals who either sing
or talk. Some of them even talk their songs
for the most part, and Fred Maguire would
be less often out of tune if he talked the
whole of his one ballad and half of a duet. The
least brilliant conversationalist in the party
is Field Fisher, whose character of an
ancient mariner must have been dragged in
to till up time. As an unnecessary interrup-
tion to the bustle and incoherency of a well-
dressed musical comedy poor Field Fisher
ought to be dragged out again. But “You’re
in Love” fills a want. Something of the
sort was required to supply the craving that
an annual pantomime creates, and the depar-
ture of the panto, was this show’s oppor-
tunity. The charms and vivacity of its
numerous Australian girl are not entirely
wasted on it. They might have been em-
ployed in trying to make the thing go at a
less propitious moment.

Bill Anderson brought his panto, of “Jack
and the Beanstalk” to Melbourne Tivoli on
Saturday. It is a rather tepid diversion,
with few inspired moments for hero Jack,
and the Giant is mostly out of work. Also
the Demon is on the- half-pay list, while the
Fairy is an intermittent damsel who has
a minute or two of muffled speech and then
retires gracefully into the gloom. The only
real appeal to juvenile fancy is provided by
a ponderous effigy of the heavy villain who
drags his unlovely hoofs about and roars in-
fanticide through a huge property head. That
bit of misdirected energy lasts five minutes
or so; then Jack prods the monster in a
vital spot and the vast corpse is removed by
the miniature Rego on his shoulder. The
largest share of the entertainment falls to
Mabelle Morgan (Jack), Dame Farrow and
the female chorus. The girls wave their
limbs with the unanimity and aplomb that
come from long practice, and they also have
the merit of making one forget some of the
songs they support. Mabelle Morgan, as
Jack, bulges from the hero’s waistbelt with
prima-donna effects, and her deep-seated
soprano gives every ear a full helping of
song. Dame Farrow needs increased lung
power to blow the fog from his utterance,
and is further disqualified hy a humor that
has become wizened with long usage. Ethel
Bennetto’s Princess is a bit bashful in the
upper register, and Vera Benson’s Alice has
nothing better to offer than a pleasant
Semitic profile and colorless amiability.
Rego and his partner, Welch, are desultory
shrieks of mirth in some business that has
become rather monotonous with Welch’s
eternal beer. Daisy Sylvester is a sprightly
Columbine with a nimble Harlequin (Yorke
Gray), and Ricardo and Smith are effective
partners in Jessie the Cow. None of the
others merit dishonorable mention ; but the
scenic artists, Ricketts and Robins, demand
a word of mild censure for a series of freez-
ing, unimaginative backgrounds that tend to
lower the pulse of the whole performance.
** * *
Sydney Majesty’s advt. crackles with proud
statistics. “The Bing Boys” have been rag-
ing for 11 weeks, the ffOth performance
happens next week, and over 155,000 play-
goers have paid to see and hear the joyous
irrelevancy. Facts like these tick-tack for
themselves.
* s[s * *
A few new lines have been dropped into the
“Samples” revue at Sydney Tivoli. But the
best news is that Renee Adoree, the stylish
little Parisian dancer who has been ill, will
presently whirl on to the bill again with her
American partner.

Norma Talmadge plies “The Devil’s
Needle” at Sydney Crystal Palace, and
wrecks so many lives that the insurance
cos. begin to despair. Then she repents,
and you see Norma Talmadge unpick-
ing the stitches. In “Red, White and
Blue Blood,” at the Globe, Francis X.
Bushman mixes it with bandits, vil-
lainous counts, drownings and other excite-
ments, and emerges victorious with all the
good things enumerated in the last chapters
of Shannon Fife’s novel. At Hoyt’s and the
Haymarket, Olga Petrova goes into Exile
with a beast of a husband, while an obliging
young man waits in the offing as a sort of
salvage party. When the fun begins Olga
parades her emotions in the usual gorgeous
gowns.
“WITHIN THE LAW," MELBOURNE
ROYAL.
Mary Turner (Muriel Starr) on her way to
prison escorted by Cassidy, of the Noo
Yark Police (James Hughes).
A commendable Australian photo-play
was tried before an invited audience at
Sydney Royal last week. “The Enemy
Within,” written by Roland Stavely, features
“Snowy” Baker in a plot dealing with
I.W.W. machinations in Australia. The open-
ing scenes are much too slow; but when
“Snowy” Baker' begins his Douglas Fair-
banks stunts the tempo quickens. The
climax comes in a high dive by the hero
from a cliff to rescue the heroine, who (with
the usual foolishness of the villain) is lashed
to a rock whicfy the rising tide will sub-
merge. Why villains don’t kill the lady
straight off and save further worrj r is
known only to the writers >of photo-plays.
“The Enemy Within” is admirably photo-
graphed ; and with lavish cuts should take
its place on the Australian bill.

“The Six Maniacs of the Wire” are on
the job. They are not related in any way to
Australia’s censorship, but belong to the
other circus—Wirths’, opening at the Hippo-
drome (Sydney) on Saturday.
To-morrow will see the last oil the Royal
Strollers at Sydney Playhouse. On Saturday
evening The English Pierrots will carry on
the tradition of smart entertainment.
At Melbourne King’s the conversion of
Muggs and Gilly continues to invite the
patronage of the Salv’army. They “go to
meeting” and join in the chorus of “Gather
at the River,” after which they sin no more.
The S.A. can ask for no truer moral drama
than “Turn to the Right.” It is a story that
the late General Booth might have loved if he
had lived to see it, and the Taps’ advt.
seems to be missing a point in not calling
attention to the fact.
“Empty Pockets,” adapted from a story
by Rupert Hughes, is the latest speechless
drama at Melbourne Majestic. It features a
murdered millionaire with a penchant for
red-haired females, and asks five of the
favored type to account for his death. It is
a great mystery for amateurs in detective fic-
tion, and has enough excitement to pull the
eye out of focus. “Because of a Woman,,
with Belle Bennett as star, is the r l riangle s
current contribution to the thrills of the pro-
gramme. It measures seven reels, and every
reel is a knock-down in the unexpected.
“Exile,” another of Olga Petrova’s love-
affairs, is in action at Hoyt’s Melbourne shop
this week. Olga is the depressed missus ot
a Portuguese schemer, and encounters a
Yankee financier who has charms and cash
enough to smash the marriage-tie. Even
Olga’s loveliness, however, is ineffectual
against his armor-plated propriety, and he
won’t yield to her beguilement until he can
marry the lady. But the virtuous denoue-
ment arrives so late in the film that the spec-
tator has plenty of time to expect something
else.
Bert La Blanc’s Travesty Stars are still
thronging the second half of the programme
at Melbourne Bijou, While Thurber and
Thurber, the Alerts, Carlton Max, Billy and
Doris, and Jack Martin help themselves to
the applause in the first hour of the evening.
Of the bunch the Alerts are the most arrest-
ing with their skilful balancing of swords and
other factious ironmongery. Next Saturday
the foregoing leave the premises and the
“Robinson Crusoe” panto, will take the stage.
Adelaide Majestic has a nearly-new bill,
with the mysterious Phrozo at the head of it.
Rose and Dell, delayed by illness, have
arrived at last, and made themselves popu-
lar at once; also Reo and Helmar do some
fine hand-balancing. At the Tivoli the old
“Never Too Late to Mend” has gone as well
as ever, giving Lesley Adrienne a good chance
as the persecuted boy. The March Show
was responsible for a good Adelaide Orches-
tra concert (Winsloe Hall conductor), and
on the other side of North Terrace the Eng-
lish Pierrots” have had a warm farewell after
a long open-air season. Tim Royal, is having
a good time. Advanced booking for the Dick
Whittington” panto, is heavy; while, as tor
Evelyn Thaw, in the “Redemption picture,
manager Myers advertises with pride that
the crowd pretty well wrecks the vestibule
and the ticket-box in its eagerness to get in.
The disturbance has now been moved to the
Town Hall.

From an Adelaide critic:
The collection of Old Masters now hung in the
Adelaide Art Gallery has been lent by the Public
Trustee, administering the estate of P. J. Cels, critic
and dealer, who died here lately from the effects of
gassing received in the defence of his country. They
are all of the Dutch or Flemish school, and at the
opening it was suggested that S. Aus. ought not
to let them get away again. The Adelaide Gallery’s
present fine collection is entirely modern, and to
secure a few of these would make it more attractive.
But to buy them in the mass would be a waste of
money, even supposing S. Aus. could afford half the
£70,000 or so they are supposed to be worth. Quite
a lot of the 31 pictures are of the type that may be
seen in any dealer’s shop in any European capital,
“attributed to” Raphael or someone else. Assuming
the genuineness of this lot, the most effective is a big
“Peasants going to Market,”, by Rubens. They are
heavy Flemish types, the woman especially, and an
attractive group, especially a very human small boy,
and a swan who is exchanging a few brisk remarks
with a dog. A regular gallery picture ; value, de-
pendent on war-time and the local circumstances.
The other most attractive pictures are portraits, of
the Burgomaster type, three by De Keyser, and one
possibly by Van Dyck, though this is arguable;
another is the striking portrait of a youth, artist
unknown. Cuyp has a valuable stable-interior, and
Brouwer a realistic tavern-brawl which at once
recalls Meissonier. Others are boors carousing, clever
portrait-studies of types, and some rough stuff which
is out of place. At the opening, W. J. Sowden,
president of the Gallery, made a strong appeal for
Government help in buying, pointing out that of the
£75,000 or so in the present collection, private
generosity has found all but £12,000. Jackson,
replying for the Ministry, promised a favorable ear
to “any reasonable financial proposal,” recognising
that the State’s picture-gallery is an “essentially
democratic” thing.

“Gron” tells the story of a consignment
of Anzacs:—
Birdie was a bright A’ictorian lad of the original
Division who had the bad luck to lose an eye early
in the game. He was sent to England to recuperate,
and in due course was put in more or less good
order and given charge of 100 other patehed-up
Anzacs to deliver in good order at Alexandria.
He took delivery of his party in Plymouth on the
night prior to sailing and addressed them in these
fatherly terms: “Now, you dinkums, we’re pushing
off at nine ack emma to-morrow. Never mind
where we’re going; but it’ll be a of a long
time before you’ll have another chance to get blithered,
so make the most of it to-night. Keep together in
parties, so that the red caps won’t be able to pinch
you. And, my God, don’t let one of you be late
in the morning! Now Pip O.Q. [Push off quickly]”.
THE HOLIDAY.
"Here for your health! Gracious —I thought
you were healthy enough!”
“So I am, but I knocked myself out making
enough money to get down here!”
“Hoo-blankv-rav!” yelled the blokes as they pipped
off Next morning at 8.30 Birdie lined ’em lip and
discovered that his party had grown to 120. The
surplus had heard about the bonza “loot” who told
his Billjims to get shiekered while they had a
chance. On arrival at Alexandria, Birdie again
delivered his pious injunction before the night’s
revel. They were to embark for Anzac on the
morrow.
Next day to the tick of time there were 150 gal-
lant Anzacs on parade. Birdie shipped ’em all with
a grin. It was only on the beach at the Cove that
he commenced to wonder how he’d account for the
additional 50. He told me about it afterwards.
“I was beginning to get the wind up in a most
colossal fashion when damned old Beachy Bill
dropped about three hundredweight of H.E. in the
middle of us and stonkered 50 of the poor blighters,
so I was home and dry.”
A pukka Tommy officah who was absorbing some
hops at the next table surveyed Birdie with amaze-
ment. Birdie hopped up and remarked cheerily,
“You don’t believe that, do you, you sceptical old
Scorpion ?” Whipping out his glass eye he dropped
it with case, precision and delicacy in the amazed
Majah’s malt and hops. “Ever try an optical cock-
tail?” They got very drunk together that night.
“Whist”: A nmn never hears the shell
that gets him on its full flight. Sound
travels at 40ft. per second; the muzzle
velocity of an h.e. shell is double that. You
hear it passing over your head, and at the
same time you see it bursting a hundred
yards beyond. This gives no chance of
ducking or dodging. Still, by ducking into
a shell-hole when one hears the sound one
may escape the hail of splinters, etc., sent
out by the explosion.
Surely “Somebody” (B. 7/3/T8)
is exaggerating. I was studying female con-
tours for two or three years and I never
heard unkind or personal remarks addressed
to the various duchesses who consented to
sit for us. For some months I was doing
the “nood” at the Yic. Artists’ galleries, and
I declare that the proceedings were as placid
and uneventful as gentlemanly artists and a
generally respectable model could make them.
Methodists will doubtless consider “respect-
able” ridiculous, but I affirm that the almost
invariable respectability of the models was
responsible for the solemn decorum of the
sittings. Occasionally a girl of another sort
might consider her position justified free
and easy behavior, but if she became demoral-
ising in her gaiety she was promptly fired.
Similarly if students were lacking in ordi-
nary courtesies to the Venus on the throne
they were just as promptly suppressed. It
is obvious that no life-class could endure if
the art director tolerated rudeness on either
side. Posing for artists, which “Somebody”
prefers, -is, of course, a different matter. In
that case the behavior of the model usually
depends on the behavior of the artist.
* * * *
“The Pariah”: “Kari’s” appeal (B.
21/2/T8) for some means to stop the adop-
tion of little white Australians by colored
people has my backing. Some years ago I
was a teacher at one of the biggest schools
in a British port in Asia, and here are three
instances within my own knowledge of white
boys whom 1 have every reason
to believe were Australians
that had been “adopted” by
Chinese. A, aged about 12,
lived in a sampan in Macao.
He couldn’t speak English,
and didn’t know how he came
into the Chinese family. Ah
Sam Pan protested that he had
bought the boy in Sydney. B,
aged about 14, I found work-
ing in a padi field a few miles
above Canton. He could speak
a very little English. He
remembered seeing his mother
receive money from a Chinese,
and after being given some
food went to sleep. He woke
up on a boat. He said he
came from “Chinnee.” He
had been badly treated, and
will carry for life the scars of
beatings he received. C, a
wizened specimen who might
have been 14 or 40, spoke
lurid broken English. He said
he was sold by his father for
opium. The web of his fingers
had been burned away—-he
said through repeated burn-
ings with lighted sticks as
punishment. He had also suf-
fered a horribly clumsy
attempt at castration. This
poor wretch was addicted to
opium, and once got to my
beer and whisky, stealing so
much that it all but killed
him. From what I could
make out he came from Broome. 1
traced also a 15-year-old girl, who had had
her left breast removed. She even recog-
nised a picture of Sydney. Poor kid —I
wonder what’s happened to her in the last
five years!
IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.
ST. PETER: “ Hey, mate, what have you there under your arm?”
MIKE: “Share, ’tis nothin’ at tal, at tal —only a bit of a fire-extinguisher in case you
draft me into the wrong mob.”
There are other ways of getting a' title
than by promising a Prime Minister not to
be a nark. Lately a London music-hall man-
ager named Tozer was knighted ; and while
the public was still wondering why, Oswald
Stoll, the Australian, best-known and cer-
tainly most successful of music-hall
in England, supplied a possible answer:—
I wish to place on record that since the year 1908
I have been repeatedly approached with proposals
which were to eventuate in a knighthood. In vari-
ous eases £lO,OOO, £12,000 and £15,000 respect-
ively were specifically named by different touts as
the sum at which the matter could be carried
through. Another proposal was that I should dis-
count two bills, each for £5OOO, the bills not to be
met should the honor be conferred before the due
date.
But the business ought to be put on a
better basis. That one broker should be
able to j)ut the little matter through for
£lO,OOO, C.0.D., while another asks £15.000,
indicates great lack of organisation. They
really do need Hughes in England, after all.
Cook’s River-road, a notable institution,
has enjoyed a mention by N. S. Wales’ Upper
House. The road is very long, very narrow,
very crooked, as brown as a drought, as
dusty ,as a whirlwind, and so far as con-
cerns the height of its buildings, painfully
stumpy. There is nothing really wrong
about it except the almost complete lack of
redeeming features. It resembles nothing
to be found in the Louvre or the Vatican,
and the Roman Coliseum doesn’t resemble
it either. Some people say that even pigs
shouldn’t live in it; others that it should be
full of pigs. Most of the buildings ought
to be burned down. There are many muni-
cipalities along the road and heaps of
mayors and aldermen, but they can do
nothing of any value if they wanted to,
which they don’t, for it would be too much
trouble and perspiration. Even if one
council made its bit of the road a leafy
avenue 140 ft. wide, with palaces on each
side, the bulk of the grievance would remain.
And Cook’s River-road can’t be avoided like
some eyesores. It is the way out of the
city for the traveller bound for the beauti-
ful South Coast, so the traveller holds his
nose and takes his life in his hands as he
skirmishes by the double tramline, and goes.
The road isn’t a very rich proposition from
a landlord’s point of view, despite the
traffic, for whatever the rent of a building
may be thereabouts it ought to be less.
Rank and fashion don’t go shopping in this
great artery of Australia’s greatest city;
the peerage avoids it, and the royal family
has never been seen there. The remark
made in the Legislative Council upon the
subject was that, as the many municipali-
ties can’t possibly agree to do anything, and
there is no Greater Sydney Council with
power to do things—that G. S. Council, like
the Harbor bridge, has got no further after
many years’ discourse —dhe patient Govern-
ment should take the work of renovation in
hand. But somebody said that the time
wasn’t ripe, or words to that effect.

“Peter”: I take up “Myola”(B. 21/2/'IS)
on the subject of comely models. It is not
valuable to an art-student’s education to fill
his eye with the agreeably monotonous con-
tours of chorus girls. All life is good train-
ing for eye and hand, and it is of no conse-
quence whether the model has the figure of
an ironing-board or is the latest descendant
of Venus di Medici so long as the artist is
considering her as an artistic problem. In
my own fairly extensive experience I can
only recall two models who approached the
pictorial effervescence of Yank magazine
illustrators, and I deny that I would have
received any greater artistic enlightenment
by looking at a whole gallery of Vera
Pearces. Beauty in bulk is terribly weari-
some. If some of our fresh girl-poets and
other adorers of the sex could only take a
course in a life school they would have some
rapid and necessary exercises in disillusion-
ment, and learn to put Lovely Woman in her
proper place in imaginative creation. One
of the merits of the late Rodin was that he
never looked at Beauty from the conven-
tional point of view. Among his great
masterpieces is a bronze of a nude grandma
with Old Age ravaging her pitiful form; yet
that wonderful study is of more value to the
artist than a chorusful of the piffling pul-
chritude that drives “Myola” to such heights
of rapture.

“7043”: The tin-lid is worth having. Dur-
ing the October stunt near Polygon Wood I
was stunned by a splinter from a shell which
burst 20 yards from me. On gaining cover
later I found that the helmet had been struck
and bent into an arc fully an inch in depth.
The splinter had then glanced upward,
grazed the crown, and gone on. On the other
hand, I once saw a soldier suddenly halt and
fall in a heap like a pithed bullock. He had
been killed by a small piece of shell which
had penetrated the brain through the crown
of the helmet. The hole made in the metal
would not admit a thin lead-pencil. That,
of course, was a direct hit; but, given any-
thing less a right-angle for approach,
the lid will do its work.
“J.D.8.”: “Pot Jostler’s” kick (B.
14/2/T8) against the unfairness of classing
Billjim as immoral reminds me that com-
mentators on the Boxer trouble
gave the Australians a very
high character. The same wasn’t
passed to all the other troops
who withstood the famous siege
of the legations. On the side
defended by the Russians was
the compound for the native
women refugees. The Russians
hatched a- plot. One night they
began to retire on the com-
pound, firing as they went.
Their delight in the pantomime
got the better of their discre-
tion and they fired so heavily
that a British squad was sent
out hurriedly to support them.
The bluejackets arrived just as the bars of
the compound were being withdrawn, and of
course the bottom fell out of the plot. One
of the senior Russian officers suicided to
escape the ridicule.

“Wolgite”: I agree with “Myola” (B.
21/2/’18) when he says that perspective
should be taught to Vie. National Gallery

low are, in the minds of most people, the two
strongest draughtsmen in Australia. Re-
garding female models, promiscuity in selec-
tion is one of the evils of the present system.
The short-term engagement of models, while
it may be desirable for artists, is very unde-
sirable for students. A few well-figured
models, male and female, should be secured
and retained as a permanent staff —as was
done in my time at the Ecole des Beaux
Arts, Paris.

How a woman can poke out her tongue at

paratively new, was shown in the Criminal

“Ripeka” : In the multitude of war deco-
rations there isn’t one that approaches in
rarity Maoriland’s own
medal. Only 23 of these
Crosses have been awarded,
all for conspicuously gallant
services in the Maori wars
of 1863-71. Three natives
who fought with the British
(one of them old Major
Ropata) had the distinc-
tion pinned on their blue
tunics; the other heroes
were pakehas. To-day
there are only seven sur-
vivors of the little squad.
One is the much-medalled
Rowley Hill, of Auckland,
who served his guns in the
old-time Navy in the Baltic
and before Sebastopol,
fought at Delhi, Cawnpore
and Lucknow in the Indian
Mutiny, and stopped a
stray bullet as a freelance
under Garibaldi; then
forest-ranged under Von
Tempsky and saved the
day at Jerusalem pa on
the Hawkes Bay coast in
’69. Another isi. William
Lingard, one of John
Bryce’s cavalry. His
special bit of gallantry
was hauling out a comrade
from under a shot-down
horse in front of the fire-
spitting Hauhau palisades
at Tauranga-ika. Captain
Gilbert Mair, another of
the old brigade, put the
fear of the Lord into Te
Kooti in 1870 by chasing
him over the Rotorua
plains, with only a couple
of dozen or so men, against
the rebel’s two hundred.
and himself killing the Ilauhap’s best, fighting
man, the half-caste Baker McLean. Mair
is a physical marvel in his old age—fit and
keen and badly disappointed at not being-
given a chance to deal Fritz one to go on
with.
A South Yarra (Melb.) maiden of 14
had a day out last week. There was nothing
doing at home. Things were dead slow. Also
mother found fault with the bored damsel
for not paying enough attention to her luxu-
riant crop of hair. So the little lady went
forth into the world and cut her hair short,
returning home at eventide with the news,
that some bad men had chloroformed her,
clipped her locks, dressed her up in boy’s
clothes and left her at large to recover her
skirts before she went back to mother. On
the strength of this news her parents sent
for the police. Of course that was the end
of it. Nevertheless, Lizzie’s effort to relieve
the monotony of existence was a brilliant
success. In the dead-slowness of her present
and future, whilst she is getting her lost
hair back, the young adventuress will have
a Past to live upon. She can just sit and
think of the exciting day when she invented
the brutal men, and the chloroform, and the
change in the sex of her garments.
Twenty-five or 30 years ago the maiden
aged 15 to 40 who went walking at dusk on
a quiet road and was rushed at and tied to
a tree by from one to 18 men was quite
common. Generally they tore her blouse
and in desperate cases were known
to steal her boots. They also took
her long distances in different vehicles
and left her at different places after
swearing her to secrecy. There were occa-
sions when they broke into a house during
the absence of the family; and despite the
desperate resistance of the general servant
or the cook or the flapper or whatever soli-
tary girl it might be, they made a wreck of
her collar, mussed up her hair something
dreadful, and left her fastened to the bed-
post by a bit of string. Occasionally articles
of small value were missing and occasionally
they weren’t. Heavy furniture was never
removed. As a rule the ruffians did no seri-
ous harm, but at times the victim swore that
they did. and in those primitive days the
Law lent an ear to the tale, and sometimes
served out hangings and other long sen-
tences. But either the little lady isn’t as
persuasive as she used to be, or the Law is
older, and probably has troubles with its
own wife, and its ear is not so easily bor-
rowed. *

“H.G.T.”: The Majali happened along
early the other morning and passed an
orderly carrying a couple of pails.
Realising the difficulty of giving a salute
with two handfuls of buckets, the orderly
“carried on.” The Majah, however, wouldn't
stand it. He invited the orderly to put down
the buckets and salute. I don’t know how
much time is wasted at other places in this
way; but this little farce stands to the
credit of Keswick (S.A.).

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Neurasthenia has robbed the Federal
Opposition of Charlie McDonald’s fire and
eloquence. The poor man is now incapable
of a big mental effort and spends much of
his time in trying to dodge his malady in
the peace of his home. McDonald will be
badly missed by the Laborites, for, before
he rose to the Speakership, he was one of
the best of their light artillery. In style
he resembled the late Fraser and Roberts,
and like them wore his nerves to shreds.

Brig.-General Johnston, of Melbourne, is
to go to Itabaul to represent the Common-
wealth Government, vice Pethebridge,
deceased. Johnston has had quite his fair
share of active service: he joined up in Aug-
ust, 1914, and his last command was the fifth
division of artillery in a place where the
mud is deep and the going willing. He was
one of the few old militia officers who had
the permanent man’s passion for polished
metal, and the only growl Billjim had about
him was that, whether they were in the line
or resting (his crowd didn’t have much rest-
ing), he was always liable to have them
whistled out to make something shine. A
lirm administrator and an experienced busi-
ness man with a saving sense of humor and
no swagger, he ought to do good work up
north.
From the Federal Gallery:—
The disembodied spirit of John Murray has found a
refuge in Jens August Jensen, Minister for Customs.
Jensen is socially at his best when he has bent him-
self into a U with a cushion behind one extremity
and a table supporting the other. He rarely sits ; he
lounges like a grotesque mastodon trying to shift
the centre of gravity from his stomach. I have seen
him using the front bench as a hammock ; and there
is mute pathos in his constant but unsuccessful hunts
for the most recumbent position. Besides resembling
Yawn Murray in his inability to maintain a
thoroughly wakeful attitude with perfect bodily
repose, he recalls the Victorian in his love for a good
story. Fasten Jens to an expensive cigar after a
decorative dinner, and he rapidly becomes a Curate’s
Guide to Knowledge.
“LIGHTING MAG," Captain-phaplain. of
the Fourth Battalion.
A returned Auzac, asked who was the
most popular officer in the Fourth, replied
“Foightin’ Mae ivery toime.” “Mac’’ was
born in Scotland more than half a century
ago. His family emigrated to Australia in
the ’seventies, took up land in Queensland
and prospered ; but the youngster wanted to
see the world and he succeeded. But, as
the doggerel puts it, “at the Cross he came
a cropper,” joined the Salvation Army and
has been one of its leading lights ever since.
He went with the Fourth Battalion as chap-
lain-captain, and the story of Gallipoli is
sprinkled with references to Mac —the big-
souled padre who never ducked and never
preached, and just because of that was the
guide and friend of the men who most needed
“a hand from home.”
The universal chorus of Australian praise
over John Redmond’s grave recalls that
when he was in N. S. Wales 35 years ago
various J’s.P. who had dared to sign an
address of welcome to “the rebel Irishman”
were struck off the roll.
Let Melbourne not forget that the late
Brassey was the first person with a large
voice to suggest the improvement of the
Yarra bank on the south side of Princes
Bridge. In Brassey.’s time that portion of
our world was a collection of marine store
bric-a-brac affording a natural Forum for
Comrade Fleming and other Bolsheviks, and
Brassey used to pass it often with eyes and
nose closed to its peculiar charms. * At a
Mayoral spread he proposed the conversion
of the offence into a garden, whereon the
Age took it up and hammered away at the
idea, whenever a few inches could be made
available. “Bill” Admans, now of Federal
Hansard, was the staff-man ordered by
David Syme to shout for the reform of the
landscape, and as Admans was a gardening
enthusiast there was a punch in every para-
graph.
Passed at 68, Bob Norman, one of the
best-known Sydney labor men of the early
’nineties. He went West when Coolgardie
was booming, and was the first Labor candi-
date to run for Kalgoorlie, but failed to beat
the then sitting member, C. J. Moran. That
was in 1597. He made several other at-
tempts to get into the Westralian Parlia-
ment on the Labor ticket, but never suc-
ceeded. When the Labor split occurred he
sided with Hughes, and has been a sad man
for many months past.
John Symott D’Arcy, Secretary of N. S
Wales Navigation Department, was a fine,
brainy battler. His father was a policeman
who had climbed to sex-geant and in that
rank had settled down at Mudgee to bring
up his family. Young Jack kept on at the
local public school as a pupil-teacher, and
read till he got his B.A. and was admitted to
the Bai\ He became the Navigation Depart-
ment’s Secretary in 1010. Outside the shop
he was the Public Service Association’s
chairman, a Public Sei’vice Board’s official
examiner, a cricket and football enthusiast,
and chairman of the Board of the University
Club, which he helped to establish.
Old J. H. Howe will fade out of S. Aus.
politics before the coming elections. He has
been in the State Parliament since 1881, with
a single break of one year, representing his
solitary defeat at the poll. Now, at the age
of 79, he thinks he has earned a rest. A
well-to-do grazier who began life as a
police-trooper (like his old colleague the late
Speaker Coles), Howe has seen things from
various angles, and has always been useful.
He was Minister for Lands in various
Cabinets under Downer and Cockburn ; but
perhaps his best work was done in the
Federal Conventions of 20 years ago, where
he was a hard-headed Scotch business man
among the politicians.
“Paddy Star” : In 1881, when John Red-
mond was in Queensland, he was invited by
Dr. K. I. O’Doherty to dinner at the officers’
mess at Lytton Camp. O’Doherty was on
the medical staff. The visit caused as much
commotion as a cat would in a canary cage.
I l’ode up to Brisbane —about 12 miles —
starting at midnight, with Redmond, and
found him a charming companion. Next
morning we went up to Goodna —Willie
Redmond being of the party—and John laid
the foundation-stone of the R.C. church.
When John Dillon came to Queensland, later
on, a little dinner was given to him by the
late Paddy Perkins. Dillon, talking with
me, advised that Australians should not in-
dulge in locally-elected Governors, as they
would be likely to lean to their political pals.
Redmond was not a fast speaker as a rule,
but there were times when he climbed up to
180 words a minute.
Wounded four times, gassed once, D.S.O.’d,
mentioned in despatches more than once, and
still on duty—that’s the record of Major
Jerry Selmes, who in private life was an
accountant in Sydney. He is a son of Cap-
tain Jeremiah Selmes, of North Sydney, who
followed the sea for close on half a century.
Though the major isn’t 40 yet he has seen a
lot of fighting. He went through the S’Afri-
can trouble, and when the Big Scrap started
left with the First Division. Three of his
bi’others are also serving with the guns, and
the fourth brother has reserved a bunk on
one of the next transports.
Gone aloft at Battery Point, Hobart, at
81, Elizabeth Banks Smith, the widow of
Canon George Banks Smith, the last of the
skypilots in Tasmania to draw Imperial pay.
The old lady was a sister to the late Wil-
liam Walker, M.L.C., of Windsor (N.S.W.).
She was the last of the original Walker
family.
Mary Gilmore, whose verse is an unusual
mixture of strength and tenderness, will be
the next Australian writer to get between
covers. Angus and Robertson will publish

Heart.”
“Macliaon’s” Book of the Browns :—•
The old hands of Newcastle would chuckle if they
could read in the asbestos edition of The Bulletin
about the fuss that is being made over Jimmy and
Sandy Brown, the founders of the coal firm of J.
and A. Brown. Jimmy and Sandy were well-known
characters in Newcastle in the middle of last cen-
tury. They were a pair of Scottish “wabsters,” and
came to the colony to work at the Stockton Cloth
Factory, which was founded in the early forties of
last century by the Donaldsons, one of whom is
still flourishing on the shores of Lake Macquarie.
Newcastle had in those days a population of 2000
and Maitland 6000; Sydney had 35,000 and Parra-
matta 10,000. Yet with that small population to
work on Donaldson’s Cloth Factory was prosperous
and was proud of its products, and it is recorded
that a billiard-table cloth 10 yards long and six
yards wide was made there at Christmas, 1845, for
the Northumberland Hotel, West Maitland. Mr.
Donaldson was then the leading man in Newcastle.
He owned, besides the cloth factory, saltpans and
ships, and worked a coal-mine in competition with
the A. A. Co., while Jimmy and Sandy Brown were
yet working weavers at his Stockton factory.
The story the “old hands” would tell of the
historic lawsuit which ended the A. A. Co.’s coal
monopoly, and in which Jimmy Brown figured as
defendant, was that the rich Dumaresqs and others
put Brown forward as a man of straw. Probably
Jimmy Brown had not enough money to fight a police-
court case, let alone a Supreme Court action and a
Full Court appeal. A Scotch “wabster” is not a
man of means, and Jimmy Brown came here on con-
tract wages. Nor could he have got much money
with his wife, for she was a miner’s daughter and
earned her respectable living as a servant at
Donaldson’s house. Sandy Brown lived and died a
bachelor. It is most improbable, then, that the
Browns would have risked the few pounds they had
been able to earn at weaving in fighting the rich
Australian Agricultural Co. Later on in life they
certainly were a pair of money-grubbers, pure and
net very simple, and .they left no single record in
Newcastle of anything attempted or done for the
benefit of the city or the citizens. So the old
hands would probably be right in their statements
that Jimmy Brown was a mere catspaw used by
the rich Dumaresqs to grab the coal monopoly out
of the hands of the A. A. Co. in 1846.

and the settlement of Port Phillip, on the

H. POPE(W.A.),
lately invalided home.
day that
“T.0.1.’5” r e-
marks were pub-
-1 i s h e d (li.
2S/2/1S) Alex-
ander Wilson told
the Vic. Histori-
cal Society that
Batman’s “dis-
coveries” were a
fable —that Bat-
man never came
to Port Phillip in
1835. One of
Wil s o n’s chief
points was that
the departure of
the Rebecca, in
which Batman is
alleged to have
tripped across
from Tasmania,
was not recorded
in the papers of
the period, nor
was its return
noted; while in
Batman’s map of
Port Phillip he
included creeks
and other fea-
tures which didn’t
exist. Batman,
according to Wil-
son, was merely a figurehead in a Tasmanian
land-grab syndicate.
On the day that his tenth child was born
Jack Wiltshire, a councillor of the Walpeup
(Vic.) Shire, got word that his eldest son
had been wounded at the Front; so he
went and enlisted to fill up the gap. His
brother Bob kept his end up through the
Gallipoli row, and after it was all over a
bolting horse ran into him and killed him
as he walked down a street in Cairo.
Forty months of active service without a
single day in hospital was part of the record
of Lieut. W. T. Watson when a piece of
high-explosive shell ripped a nine-inch slit
in his equator. A N. S. Wales and Aus-
tralian Rugby Union football forward, he
was playing with Newtown, Sydney, when
the war whistles called. The first transport
out of Fort Jackson carried him to Rabaul;
then Egypt and Gallipoli; and finally France
and a D.C.M. during the Somme offensive.
“Billy Blue” adds a footnote to history:—
John Black, the pioneer of the Black family
(there’s a grandson, Reggie, still in the N. S.
Wales Leg. Council), was the first merchant captain
to sail a vessel through Bass Straits, earlier skippers
sailing south of Tasmania to get to Sydney. Captain
Black, in command of the Harbinger brig, of 56 tons,
from the Cape of Good Hope, arrived at the mouth of
the Straits on January 1, 1801. He had no chart,
but believed there was a passage, and pushed in.
He got through without a mishap, made a chart of
his track, arrived in Port Jackson on January 12 and
reported his success to Governor King, only to find
that lI.M. sloop Lady Nelson, in command of
Lieutenant Grant, R.N., had gone through the Straits
during December. Governor King purchased the Har-
binger, changed her name to Norfolk, armed her, and
placed her under the command of William House.
This was the genesis of the Australian navy. The
little vessel was armed with six small guns and
carried a crew of 20.
GREETING: EASTER, 1918.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now when others speed good wishes to the loved
and living only
In the far lands, on the sea-ways, or wherever they
may roam,
1 am sending you a greeting lest your spirit should
go lonely
In the Halls of Highest Heaven for a loving word
from home.
I irst, I send you love most loyal (though on earth I
shall not meet you)
From the land you loved, and died for, that is robed
in summer sheen;
And I think that you will listen when my love goes
out to greet you,
Though I may not hear you answer, for the star-
ways lie between.
Know the things you loved recall you; for the well-
known gully’s holding
Moss and fern and flickering shadow, as when we two
wandered there;
And the rills go singing ever, and the woods are
green and golden,
And the sweep of misty mountains at the dawn is
still as fair.
And at night the grey road stretching where the
moonbeams shift and glisten
Still is fringed with silken grasses, as when we two
walked thereon;
And the dark pines o’er it whisper as they whispered
—do you listen ?
AVhen we strove to catch their meaning on a night
forever gone.
Oh, I think 3'ou know, as memories of the dead days
gather o’er me,
That I speak your name this morning with a
passionate pride ; and yet
Bitter tears of hopeless longing blot the blue hills
out before me—•
Pride is mighty, Ileart’s-Beloved, but it cannot curb
regret.

| '""tlh E relation of price
l 1 J to value varies a
great deal.
When a man has to clothe him-
self out of a limited allowance for
dress, he invariably thinks more
about the price he should pay for
a suit than anything else.
But the fact that his spending
must be limited is the very reason
why he should consider what he

The cheapest in made-to-measure clothes is nearly
always the lowest in quality —is cheapest, as a
rule, because something of quality is sacrificed
consequently is of doubtful value in relation to price.

be purchased to a price low enough to meet the
demands of the man of limited means who wants
to appear well-dressed. And by virtue of the

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Bulletin has hitherto tried to get the
Commonwealth Treasury to do three things
in connection with War Loans: —
(1) To refrain from prejudicing tlie future of
Australia by issuing' tax-free loans.
(2) To make some arrangement with the banks
by which people could lend their future savings.
(3) To sell annuities.
(1) In connection with the present loan
lenders have the option of taking either 44
p.c. tax-free loans- or 5 p.c. loans subject
to income-tax. It is an unsatisfactory
arrangement to this extent: that 44 p.c.
tax-free is still worth a good deal more
than 5 p.c. to the very rich taxpayer.
Watt, Federal Acting-Treasurer, who is
handling the present loan, announces,
however, that this Government will not
issue another tax-free loan. This should
produce some big subscriptions. (2) An
arrangement has been made with the
banks by which they will advance to approved
clients 00 p.c. of the face value of the new
loan, charging 4 p.c. for the accommodation,
the advances to be for periods up to IS
months. Two years would be better ; and
it may be possible to arrange for that in
special cases, though the matter will not
rest wholly with the banks, for they, of
course, have had to arrange to get this cheap
money, if they should need it. Whether
some of them will be able to finance sub-
scribers for periods in excess of 18 months at
the 4 p.c. rate depends therefore upon
whether the Commonwealth Bank will give
them backing. For, of course, it is the Com-
monwealth Bank that is standing behind the
new scheme. This plan for helping would-
be lenders to subscribe future savings will be
of special value to insurance offices, which
can tell in advance pretty well what their
accumulations for the next two or three years
will amount to. As a matter of fact the
Mutual Life and Citizens’, which has already
subscribed four and a half millions and is
now putting in for another two millions, has
adopted this plan throughout. It didn’t have
all the money. But it was as sure as any-
body can be of anything in the future that a
certain amount would flow in, in premiums,
etc., during the next two or three years. (3)
Nothing has yet been done in the way of
selling annuities; yet this plan would prob-
ably suit thousands of people who have a
certain amount of capital to live on and
would be quite satisfied to invest it in return
for an assured income during life. With a
live man at the Treasury something will be
done with this proposal in the future if it
becomes necessary to float another loan.
Meantime, however, it is some satisfaction to
know that two out of three of this paper’s
pet ideas in connection with War Loan flota-
tion have already been either wholly or in
part adopted.

But the increase of foOOO-odd over the
figures of a year ago does not necessarily
mean that the pint-pot is being filled more
often. Last year the metropolitan breweries
combined to do a little price-fixing. First
of all, in conjunction with the_ licensed
victuallers’ associations, they fixed the mini-
mum retail liquor-prices for hotels, the
arrangement incidentally providing that
supplies, would be denied the price-cutter.
The breweries, having created the machinery
whereby Bung could make a little more,
naturally didn’t forget themselves. And, no
doubt, the increased profit for the past half-
year is principally due to that mutual
arrangement between brewery and pub.
That something had to be done is shown by
the increase in expenses during recent years:

In IDI2 wages, charges and management
exes, absorbed 05.1 p.e. of gross profit on
brewings; in 11)17 the cut had leaped to
almost 84 p.e. Now. however, on the in-
creased profit the percentage has been got
down to 80.3.
In spite of the effects of six o’clock clos-
ing and increased costs. Toohey’s is not
going into mourning. Take two five-year
comparisons:—
1908. 1913. 1918.

Book debts . . . . 112,954 147,965 143,067
Cash 6,624 3,074 9,859
In five years to 11)13 the co. improved its
liquid assets by £57,330, and, besides making
additions to plant, added £43,281 to proper-
ties, etc. During the past five years the
liquid position has been bettered by £57,793,
and £34,170 has been added to properties,
etc. For the first period the dividend aver-
aged almost 0 p.e. p.a., and for the past
five years almost 8 p.e. p.a: So if Cold Tea
thought six o’clock closing was going to
prove a smashing blow to the breweries it
was mistaken. As a matter of fact, some
inquiry ought to be made to find out exactly
what has been the result of early closing:
whether it has not turned every brothel into
a sly-grog shop, and thus indirectly in-
creased the ravages of venereal disease.
Still, the beer industry is under a cloud.
And the future cannot be foretold : anything
might happen when the present arrangement
lapses six months after peace is made. The
no-liquor party is still very active —only the
other day the Hotel Sydney, one of the
city’s most important residential pubs,
acquired a license by permission of the
Court, and Cold Tea has promptly lodged an
appeal against the transfer. But in the
liquor referendum there were many who
considered early-closing merely as a win-
the-war necessity; and there is no telling
how they will view the question later on.
Apart altogether from the matter of restric-
tions, there will be many a parched tongue
when we commence to pay our war bill;
so the future for breweries is not at all
bright. Wherefore this co.’s 16s. shares,
which were worth 275. in July, 1914, can be
had now for about 18s.

To be quite frank, this page doesn’t think
much of the table it has constructed with
difficulty. To begin with, the first little co.
—Pearson, Law, Ltd.- —paid £7OOO for the
goodwill of the Pearson-Law business and
something also went in preliminary exes.;
but this paper doesn’t know exactly how
much, because it doesn’t know* what profit
was made during the first few months of the
co.’s life. The business, with a lot of
energy behind it, had got a good start before
the war came to give it a further lift. The
original capital of about £35,000 was soon
insufficient; and the ordinaries, which the
old proprietors had accepted, left the profit
in the concern for three years. In 1916, to
make up for this, they took £5664 in shares.
Then, as extensive advertising had thor-
oughly introduced the co.’s “Pelaco” trade-
mark, it was decided to re-form the co. and
give it that name. The capital as at Dec.,
1916, and Dec., 1917, compares this way:—
1916. 1917.
Cum. pref» “A” (7 p.e.) . . £29,736 £29,736
Preference “B” (9 p.e.) .. 48,000
Ordinaries .. . . . . 19.824 40,000
£49,560 £117,736
Less uncalled . . . . . . 36,000
£49,560 £81,736
Some of the shares were evidently issued
against goodwill; for the old goodwill item,
which had been reduced to £2OOO net, has
sprung up to £17,051; and underwriting
commission and preliminary exes, stand
among the assets for £3435. Also there
was a special dividend on Bept. 20 last
probably to pay for some of the shares.
For the period since Sept. 20 the div. on
ordinaries was at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a. At
that rate, the ordinaries and the prefs. (with
£12,000 paid on the 4 ‘B’s”) will call for
about £7150 a year. But as the co. still
owes about £25.000, no doubt more of the
pref. money will be got in. though at 9 p.c.
it is pretty expensive. There certainly is
some patriotism about a co. that will apply
for £5OOO of 44 p.c. War Loan, as this co.
has done, when it is getting in money at
9 p.c. to reduce its liabilities. However,
profits iire good; and if the tariff is made
really Protective, they will continue good;
for there will be a few more tens of thousands
of men back in Australia presently to wear
the co.’s products. And when Australia makes
up its mind that it wants all the work it
can provide for its own people, and conse-
quently settles down to a policy of effective
Protection, it won’t be necessary to offer a
9 p.c. preference in order to get capital.

But don’t attach much weight to the figures
for any single year. The co.’s properties,
Thurulgoona and Bundalear, are away out
in the south-west of Queensland, where
nature goes on dreadful sprees. One year
there is a drought; the next, with a fat
rainfall, there is an excess of everything
except stock. In the 24 years from the
middle of 1913 to the end of 1915 there was
only 164 in. of rain, and most of that was
in little lots that did hardly any good, so that
for 1915 only 4030 lambs were marked.
After that there was no rain worth men-
tioning for another six months, and in 1916,
not only was the lambing a failure, but in
the drought and the early weeks of the rain
23,500 sheep were lost. With the rains came
the blowfly pest; and that and the short
supply of stock have been the past year’s
troubles. At the end of 1913 there were
107,791 sheep on the run; by the end of
1916 the number was down to 49,708. At
Dec. 31 last the tally was 63,014, and with
ordinary luck the end of this year should see
the flocks pretty well restored to the end-
of-1913 figure. It is a wonderful business
this. There is no other in the world, per-
haps, where the man or the co. that can
hang on can make so quick a recovery.
As the profit is to a very considerable
extent governed by the increase or decrease
of stock, a better idea of how the business
has panned out, so far as actual money is
concerned, can be got from this comparison :
1907. 1915. 1916. 1917.
Liabilities.. ..£44,075 £1,031 £1,114 £652

Cash, etc. . . 103 33,665 16,635 27,969
Thus in 10 years liabilities have been reduced
by £43,423, while cash, etc. (the etc. is now
War Loan), has been increased by £27,866;
total improvement £71,289. Meantime share-
holders have had £134.000 by way of divi-
dend and bonus. (This includes the 1907
dividend, but not that for 1917. which had
not been paid as at Dec. 31.) This is on a
capital of £292,005. The dividend has thus
averaged 4J p.c. and the improvement before
mentioned is equal to nearly 24 p.c. p.a. more.
That isn’t so bad, especially as throughout
the shares have been at a heavy discount.
There are, however, three huts in this case:
(1) Since 1907 the co. has lost about a
fourth of its holding; (2) the lease of the
other 1018 sq. miles will expire in 1935 or
thereabouts; and (3) though with good
seasons—and on the law of averages a couple
more are due —breeding-up will be rapid, the
holding has still less stock than it had 10
years ago. On the other hand the woollies
are probably worth more; and neither they
nor the clip are likely to be low-priced for
years to come. Because of the reduction of the
holding and the running out of the lease the
directors advise shareholders to regard any-
thing over 34 p.c. they receive as return of
capital; and when a couple more two-
shillings are paid they will probably have
the capital written down from 60s. to 50s.

Better than this paper figured on 12 months
ago. “If,” it said then, “the co. can aver-
age a net profit of 7d. per lb., which seems
a fair figure to assume, the total for the
current year should be about £1780, which
is equal to just about 8 p.c. on the very
moderate capital of £22,431.” Both the
factors—output and profit per lb.—were
rather better than the estimate: the co.
Siived 04,2S41b. instead of the expected
01,4501b., and the profit was very nearly
It ought to be more by this time; at
any rate, exes, ought to be less. But the
Federated Malay States, are not putting the
bill for everything on to the file; hence,
according to the directors’ statement, the
co. had last year to carry extra taxation
amounting to only a shade under 4d. per
lb. of rubber —equal to very nearly one-
third of the gross profits. Still, if we pay
now we shall not have to pay presently.
There is no dodging the bill altogether.
The estate consists of 808 acres; plant-
ing was commenced in 1010, and this shows
the progress:—
1910 .. 36 ac. 1914 .. 251 ac.
1911 .. 175 „ 1915 .. 21 „
1912 .. 40,, 1916 .. 172 „
1913 .. 69 „ 1917 .. —
So far only the 1010-11-12 trees have been
tapped. It would be possible to pick up a
few in the 69 acres (1913 planting) this
year; but there isn't enough skilled labor
t-> dodge about, and this lot will be left till
next year. Then 820ac. will be tapped, and
there will still remain 444ae. to tap. They
should be returning 2501b. to the acre in
the seventh year. By 1921 the co. ought
therefore to have a nice little harvest. Mean-
time, having planted all its area, it is looking
round for other worlds to conquer, but
hasn’t yet found any in the neighborhood.
The labor trouble is less unsatisfactory than
it at one time promised to be, and appar-
ently it hasn’t been found necessary to per-
severe with a former intention to introduce
Javanese. The other uncertain quantity in
estimating probabilities is the rubber mar-
ket. When the co. was formed the stuff
was worth very nearly 5s. per lb., find had
been more. Last year the average price
was 2s. 1.3d. Singapore; and, though there
has been such an enormous increase in the
use of rubber, the price has been still lower
lately. There is an interesting little story
hanging to that, by the way. The two great
Powers in the rubber-growing Malay Penin-
sula and Archipelago are Britain and Hol-
land ; and the Dutch-controlled production
continued to go to “Continental ports”—
Oh, no, not Germany! However, though
the Hun lied manfully about his famine in
rubber, etc., and though the Censorship
encouraged the English-speaking public to
swallow the Hun’s lies, finally the Allies
were driven to take action to control the
shipment of rubber to “Continental ports.”
As soon as this was done, the old market
being gone, rubber flowed in on Singapore;
and that and the scarcity of shipping to
get it away has made the market very limp
for the time being.

But the figures for any one half-year don’t
tell truly the results of mining operations in
that term. If, for instance, the mine were
closed throughout the current half-year, a
considerable profit would still be shown at
the end of the period. The Sulphide Cor-
poration is the only Broken Hill co. which
does its own smelting. The others now send
their silver-lead concentrates to the Associ-
ated Smelters at Port I’irie —the old Broken
Hill Prop, works which general-manager
Deiprat managed to get rid of by one of the
shrewdest deals ever made in Australia.
The Associated Smelters have contracts with
the mining cos., which receive at once 90 p.c.
of the metal value ; for the purpose of this
preliminary settlement lead is at present
taken at £25 and silver at 2s. The final
settlement is made on the basis of the aver-
age values of the metals in the half-year
succeeding delivery. During the past half-
year lead has been kept steady at about £29,
while silver has been as high as 45,, and is
still over 3s. 9d. Now, in the half-year to
June, 1917, the North mine produced 111,290
tons of ore, yielding in concentrates 14,770
tons lead and 500,4000 z. silver; so there was
a nice little surplus to be collected on that
lot—nearly £5 a ton for the lead and, say,
Is. 6d. for the silver. For the current half-
year the surplus will be much less, because,
mainly owing to the strike which laid the
mine idle for _ ll weeks, only 64,030 tons ore
were produced, containing in concentrates
7414 tons lead and 270,4(X>0z. silver. That,
of course, doesn’t mean that the total profit
for the current half-year will be less than
last term’s, because on present appearances
this term’s output will be much greater.
The profits, despite the strike, are daz-
zling. As mentioned above, the output for
the half-year was 64,030 tons ore. The
profit, after striking off £11,592 for depre-
ciation, and without including some small
reserve-fund accretions, was £209,838. This
was equal to £3 ss. 7d. per ton of ore. Now
go back to the corresponding half of 1913,
the last accounts issued prior to the war.
The profit, computed in the same way for
that half-year, was £134,583, and the output
was 154,829 tons; so this pre-war profit was
17s. 4d. per ton. There you have the war
profit—the difference between 17s. 4d. and
£3 ss. 7d. per ton. Yet, according to the
advices which the cos. have received, this co.
will not have to pay one penny on account
of war profits. The Hughes Government has
done hardly a thing besides talk and pass
this war-profits tax. And that is the sort
of tax it is.
Even 17s. 4d. per ton is above the normal.
Computed over a long course of years the
average Broken Hill profit has been under
15s. per ton; and certainly no more than
that can be relied upon for the future.
Spelter (zinc) is now well over £5O per ton;
a normal price is about £23. The ore re-
serves above the 1400 ft. level are estimated
at 2,750.000 tons. At 14s. that lot is worth
£1.975.000. Besides that, the co. has a sur-
plus of liquid assets as follows :
Dec., 93. June, ’l7. Dec., ’l7.
Assets apart from mine
an<l plant .. ..£234,718 £763,154 £862,504
Liabilities . . . . 25,677 261,669 270,960
Surplus ..£209,041 £501,485 £591,544
These assets include 200,000 shares in the
Associated Smelters, against which the co.
now owes £179,400 of the original £200,000
of debentures. Excluding the share holdings
on the one side and the debentures on the
other, the co. has a liquid surplus of
£558,143. Add that to the £1,975,000 above-
mentioned ; total, £2,533,143, divided among
600.000 shares = £4 4s. per share. But it
will take, say, 10 or 12 years to work out
these reserves and pay the dividends. On
the other hand, the mine doesn’t end at
1400 ft. During the past half-year the main
shaft was deepened to 1624 ft., and prepara-
tions made to drive a level at 1550 ft. The
lode has not been explored at that point;
but at 1400 ft. it is 85ft. wide in section 15,
and though it is an irregular body, a lode
that width isn’t likely to peter out in a few
feet. As to metal contents, take last half-
year’s figures:—
lead Silver Zinc
Tons. p.c. oz. p.c.
Total ore.. .. 64,030 14.9 7.5 12.9
Ore from 1400 ft. . . 16,338 15.0 8.1 12.4
So the ore going underfoot is well up to the
average. The zincy tailings from the mill
go to De Bavay’s; but “arrangements have
been entered into with Minerals Separation
and De Bavay Processes Co. for a license to
use its patented processes; but until the
expiration of the agreement with the Amal-
gamated Zinc Co. that license will be limited
to the treatment of slime.” The agreement
referred to runs to April 30 next year.
Occidental, Cobar (N.S.W.), during its
last half-year treated 8018 tons of lO.lGdwt.
ore for a profit of £1022 ; but the position is
not as satisfactory as the profit suggests.
From the beginning of this year the manage-
ment was handed over to J. Weir, and this
is what he says :
Whilst the body of ore is undoubtedly there and
contains payable value, it has been left in such a
way that advantage cannot be taken of the position.
Instead of having the reserve of broken ore that is
absolutely necessary to work large stopes, I found,
when I took charge on January 3, that the mine
was almost stripped of ore, and the struggle now is
to build up this deficiency and keep the battery
going. Mullocking of stopes was also a long way
behind. Development work has been entirely
neglected, and if this policy was persisted in much
longer it would either mean a drain on the share-
holders’ pockets or a suspension of operations. That,
shortly, is the position ; and though it appears gloomy
it has its brighter side... .There is no reason why this
mine, with its large body of ore averaging about
lOdwt., should not with judicious handling be made
to pay.
The same old story; but what were the
directors doing to allow the mine to get into
such a state? And what are the share-
holders doing?
Great Cobar is applying for suspension of
labor conditions on its Cobar (fold and
Chesney leases. Not that it matters very
much to labor, because the Chesney is filled
up with water to 20ft. above No. 2 level, and
the only men employed there Are two or three
who are demolishing the £BO,OOO flotation
plant. The co. is selling odds and ends and
using up parts, etc., to keep the stores
accounts down to bedrock at the Great
Cobar. The Cobar Gold Mine has about four
men underground when there is nothing for
them to do on top, and the water is being
kept out of the property. Shortage of basic
ore for the smelters appears to be the
trouble. But the bailiff and the black cat
are considering things, and may possibly
decide to create a sensation in the near
future. A fine staff is still maintained on
Great Cobar, which continues to look well.
By sluicing 364,000 cub. yds. last half-
year, Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), did
almost as well as in the previous term, in
spite of floods. Yields showed a nice im-
provement, Id. per cub. yd. more gold being
got and fid. additional tin. During the last
two runs the plant strayed into ground on
the north side of the big paddock, thereby
proving that there is good wash outside the
limits assigned by Moline as the probable
boundary of the pay dirt. That fact makes
Cock’s look a .better market tip than ever
before. Altogether the co. won 17id. per cub.
yd. in tin and gold, against 15.171 d. per cub.
yd. in the previous half-year. But costs
shot up to 94d. from S.9d. in the previous,
term. The merits of Cock’s Pioneer to-day
are that there is more ground up-stream
than is shown on Moline’s plans, and with
shallower and less broken ground costs should
be lighter than heretofore.
* * * *
Stawell (Vic.) has annexed John Couch-
man from Maldon to run Sloane and Scotch-
mans. With costs up because of dear sup-
plies and labor, it didn’t take Couchman long
to quit Sloanes as too poor to pay just
now. Still he talks of getting a payable
go out of the old Magdala within six months.
To do this he will draw solidly on the decent-
grade dirt showing round the 1200 ft. level,
where he has 25,000 tons to play with. Ilis
further intentions are to dig after the stone
bored into ahead of the “M” crosscut and as
soon as possible to unwater the mine to
1500 ft. Then he will hunt after the exten-
sion of the Magdala shoot under 1400 ft. So
Stawell. has dreams of better days.
* * * *
W. L. Baillieu, talking to the fatmen of
the Victorian Leg. Council, says he was one
of the syndicate that brought out the Ger-
man experts before the war to sample Mor-
well brown coal. Thus goes to the wall
the yarn that W.L. hadn’t a finger in the
importing of that clever quartette. W ith
usual skill in picking out the right track,
Baillieu recommends the State to make sure
that big users of current like the Melbourne
City Council and the Melbourne Electric
will take power if it goes to work at
Morwell. Nothing easier, should the Fat
Men agree to make the State the wholesale
supplier, as in Ontario, Canada. That is
not going a step further than the recom-
mendation of the Coal Conservation Com-
mission of Great Britain, of Avhich engineer
Mertz is the chairman. It proposes that
England and Scotland shall be cut up into
16 supply districts, with huge central power-
stations. These are to displace all private
isolated stations, with a saving in coal of
SO million tons annually, besides furnishing
cheaper power than ever was dreamt about.
Such a scheme means industrial revolution.
It is this that drives men like City Electrical-
Engineer Harper and other brown-coal en-
thusiasts into preaching Morwell as Mel-
bourne’s salvation. The issue put by W. L.
Baillieu is either a private monopoly in
electricity or a State one. The Bulletin
knows into whose tender mercies it would
prefer to put the power for the manufac-
turing industry of a State.
* * * *
Chairman T. Iv. Fairthorne put Mount
Bischoff shareholders in a pleasant frame of
mind at the 89th half-yearly meeting by
hinting at a further ss. dividend this month.
Thereupon the retiring directors were re-
elected without opposition, and the directors’
fees were increased from £859 to £675 (the
directors got £750 in the old days when
shares sold for £6O and paid 10s. per month
in divs.). General-manager Millen told them
that everything at the mine was looking well,
the new batteries were doing all that
was expected of them, and incidentally the
timber which had been sold from the sawmill
had practically paid for what had been used
in the mine.
Mt. Bischoff Extended (Tas.) has
struggled for years to make 1 p.c. tin from
narrow lodes pay exes., but now that 1 p.c.
pure metal is worth 60s. the show has a
better chance. So the plant is to be re-
modelled and 10 head of heavy stamps put in.
* * * *
The Queenslander, the only working mine
belonging to Etheridge Gold Mines Ltd.,
Forsayth, has its days numbered. Available
ore will be exhausted in eight months
or so. The reef is not cut out, by any
means, but is strong underfoot; and what
is more, it is the best-defined lode on the
Etheridge field. It is 700 ft. long and aver-
ages 3ft. in width, with loz. gold and a
silver-lead concentrate to help. To sink the
shaft and open up No. 4 level the co. sold
its fine electrical plant, and since then
no development has been undertaken. When
this bit of ore is removed the To-let notice
will be posted up, as the co. has no more
plant to dispose of and cash is its weakness.
Costs per ton of ore milled amount to 625.
7d. Mining the stone costs 265. 2d. per ton,
milling eats another 20s. The balance is
made up of charges for marketing the con-
centrate (11s. 7d.) and transportation of
ore from mine to mill by horse teams (4s.
10d.). The ore is treated at the Havelock
mill, about three miles from the mine. Dur-
ing the wet season the problem is to get
sufficient ore to keep the mill going one
shift.
* * * *
Mt. Cutlibert (Q.) has struck a 6sft. ore
body in the Orphan mine at 180 ft. giving
10 p.c. copper. A few weeks ago a smaller
ore body was struck in the crosscut at the
140 ft. level. The Orphan is near the famous
Dobbin mine arid is connected with the rail-
way.
* * * *
Having paid the second instalment of
£7OO to the vendors, Golden Butterfly (W.A.)
announces that the shaft on the optioned
Blue Streak lease at Tuckabianna is to be
sunk to 150 ft. “in order to prove the mine.”
It is a pity the co. could not have withheld
payment of the instalment until the value of
the show at 150 ft. had been determined, as
some experts who ought to know are very
dubious about the permanency of Tucka-
bianna shoots.
* * * *
Several favorable comments have been
made recently concerning the Eastern-financed
Mount Rankin Co.’s latest acquisition, the
old Day Dawn. Eighteen years ago this
show was taken in hand by a local syndicate,
but at 200 ft. water became troublesome and
refractory ore was struck. This was more
than the syndicate could bear, so it gave in
after spending £12,000. It is alleged that
the sulphides exposed carry payable gold,
and that something might be made out of
the arsenic they contain. But the Mount
Rankin crowd had better go warily.
* * * *
Very little happens at Ivanowna (W.A.)
nowadays, but the few remaining inhabitants
worked themselves into a fever of excitement
a week or two ago over a gold discovery
within the town boundary. A number of
allotments, including one on which the Pres-
byterian Church is built, were pegged, and
according to reports the outcrop can be
traced a long way. But it will take a good
shaking-up to arouse Kanowna.

FOR WOMEN WHO HATE ROUGE.
A TOILET HINT.
Ladies who suffer from pale, sallow, bad
complexions, yet who quite naturally object
to the “loud,” coarse and “made-up” appear-
ance almost inevitably associated with the
ues of rouge—which also, by the way, is
often distinctly harmful to the complexion
—will be interested to learn that they can
easily regain the velvety, child-like fresh-
ness of their complexions by using a simple,
inexpensive lotion composed of 2oz. of rose
water, 1 dram tincture of benzoin and 2oz.
of flowers of oxzoin. Shake well before
applying with a soft cloth or sponge. When
dry brush lightly with a soft cloth or a
piece of chamois leather. If you will do
this whenever you go out you will always
have a soft, natural refined color, of which
your friends cannot be suspicious and _of
which you need not be ashamed. This lotion
is also exceptionally beneficial in relieving
and preventing chapped faces and hands, as
well as redness due to exposure to weather.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 11, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
The Easter show brings the girl-astride
into the helter-skelter over the hurdles, and
there will be hardly a side-saddle in the
whole high-jump kit. There’s still a Women's
Industries section, though it is more of a
weakling than ever since the war came down
like a universe of curses on the crochet quilt
and knobby patchwork cushions. As for the
wax flowers, no one has yet been able to get
Secretary Somer’s honest opinion on the sub-
ject.
Miss Henderson, sister of the commodore
who was in command of Port Jackson for a
while, is now perambulating sec. for the Aus-
tralian Board of Missions. She’s the lady
who couldn’t get a passport to return to
England, and has been hon. sec. to the
sailors’ wives’ social affairs here, with after-
noon parties at the Naval House as fluffy
interludes. If the capable woman orates
with the same telling force for Black Brother
as she does for the Red Cross, that casual
person’s Bible fund will get a great move-up.
Leichhardt Park was a human antbed on
Saturday afternoon. The lads of the village
played cricket on the green—as in the peace-
ful days of old —and a big concourse of other
lads gave their applause. Later on, a khaki
band played a large motor on to the oval, and
the joyful cricketers moved out of the way
to a more secluded side of the park. But the
crowd found time to cheer the long grey car,
built so that a wounded soldier can stretch
out if necessary. This handsome chaise, the
gift of Leichhardt, Rozelle, Haberfield and
other interlocked suburbs, was then handed
over to the Broughton Hall Military Hospi-
tal. Mrs. Laidley represented the Red Cross.
Mayor Blackmore, the local municipal parent,
made a few remarks, and Hoskins, M.L.A.,
gave his benediction to the men who have
fought for us.
At the Town Hall on Saturday evening a
huge audience watched brass-band conductor
Kerry lift his finger for “God Save.’’ Soprano
Lillian Mitchell has brought back from
Britain a pure and well-trained voice, and the
a pure and well-trained voice, and the
frank and boyish manner of a cathedral-
choir angel. But she was very nervous
at this her first appearance in her native
Sydney for nearly four years. And a
husky little imp in her throat—the cold of
the moment—made her less effective in the
operatic snippets than in one or two delight-
ful ballads. Various ushers lent their aid to
pass the flowers—a waggon-load—over the
platform’s edge. Lilian Frost was at the
organ, and a good concert company, includ-
ing Staell and his fiddle, supported the singer
who dared to take the Town Hall in these
war-worn days.
Easter-week races won’t attract Mrs.
Harry Osborne, Lesley Madden and other
well-known members of the family of the
kindly Victorian Chief Justice, John
Madden. His sudden death brings a sheaf
of reminiscences and regrets.
Frank Coffee, of Chatswood, had a boy,
another Frank, who was among the very first
Australians to leap ashore at Gallipoli ; but
at the Evacuation he was lying in the shadow
of a wooden cross. Naturally father wanted
the grave to carry a more permanent mark,
and applied to the Pope, through the Austra-
lian Apostolic Delegate, for help. “To the
most zealous efforts made 1 v the Apostolic
Delegate at Constantinople,” Cardinal Gas-
parri reports, “the answer of the German
naval authorities was as follows: ‘The erec-
tion of a marble cross on the grave of Lieut.
Coffee can only be effected by express order
of the High Command of the Otto-
man Army and by Turk workers or
soldiers.’ ” Then a better idea hit the
Cardinal: as it would be very difficult to
maintain a cross on the grave, even if per-
mission could be got to put it there, why not
have the body x - emoved? The Turk and his
lord the German agreed, and there’s a good
Australian lying now in the R.C. Cemetery
at Constantinople, and a more contented
father waiting in Australia till he can go
and wipe away a tear alongside it.
Before leaving for Maoriland to use that
extra two months’ holiday, the Chief Justice
and his lady gave a chatx-iotic garden party
at Tregoyd—“to meet the Governor and
Lady Davidson.” Therefore all and sundry
who go down to their depots with knitting
or swarm round pyramids of Red Cross
oacking, were summoned to the party.
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Kemp, who bought
Lilianfels, the one-time home of the Darleys,
on the eyebrows of a Katoomba gorge, have
persuaded Governor Davidson to open their
Red Cross fete on Easter Saturday. Lady
Davidson, when she was Miss Feilding, once
spent a few days there with the first owners.
Since then the scenery has acquired a thatch
of tin hats, and mountain cots are plentiful
as blackberries.
Our new sub-regal lady generally wears a
diamond cluster ear-ring in each pink lobe—
nothing else, as a rule, in the way of gems
for daytime functions. In spite of the short-
age in dyer’s delicate colors, she manages to
wear shoes and hose in the exact shade of
her favorite grey gowns.
Lieut. Norman McKeown, actor, author
and soldier, lately married his ex-command-
ing officer’s widow. Another son of the
Waverley parson has been invalided home.
Norman —he wrote “The Muck Rake”—finds
time between shells to still turn out a little
light literature.
On Friday afternoon Excellency Helen
presides over a big meeting that’s summoned
to Her Majesty’s Theatre. The object is to
reach woman’s ear in the interests of Red
Cross Day.
Danger Owen, K.C., and daughter Gladys
are back from Maoriland after a few weeks’
rest from their Red Cross and recruiting
sacrifices.
Governor Davidson had a look at the
Miller’s Point Free Kindergarten and play-
ground the other day. The playground—the
land was given by the Harbor Trust —is an
oasis in a desert of bricks. To Mrs.
Francis Anderson, wife of the Uni. profes-
sor, goes most of the applause when there’s
a mention of these lungs for the babies of
the crowded places —her hobby for five-and-
twenty years.
For the Titbits show in the Repertory
on March 30 and April 1 one fascinating
young matron has already sold 80 guinea-
tickets. Society is ambushed behind the
affair, which is to raise funds for the Light
Horse and Camel Corps boys in the desert.
The Women’s Hospital (Crown-street)
having got a recent lift has acquired adjacent
premises called “Hillerest.” This will give
temporary shelter to some of the nurses.
Later, when the Nightingales get into decent
quarters of their own, the waiting patients
will be domiciled in this building. There’s
to be a general meeting to wash up the
report and balance-sheet with tea and music
on March 22.
The Journalists give their first 1918 lunch
at Farmer’s this week. Our New-found-
(land) Excellency will be the guest.
Save your fat! Kitchen fat, I mean. The
Red Cross pickle factory is now a dripping
depot. Here Mrs. Joscelyn and her V.A.D.
girls are rendering down the dripping that
goes to our half-starved prisoners-of-war in
lib. tins. The Commissioner’s abroad now
advise smaller tins so as to spread the sus-
tenance over a larger surface.
John Longstaff will
be well represented
at the coming Loan
Exhibition. Happily
Sydney possesses in
perpetuity the fam-
ous Victoria n’s
“Lady in Black.”
whose serene face
and haunting eyes
arrest the gaze of the
most casual visitor
to the Australian
court. There are
many great portraits
besides, notably that
of Henry Lawson;
for Longstaff, whose
precocious genius won
the first Victorian
travelling scholar-
ship with “Breaking, the News,” has been
twice in Australia since Europe claimed
his brush. During the earlier visit he
shared Sid Long’s studio in Sydney. Here
he slapped on the gorgeous color in Chief
Justice Frederick Darley’s portrait. His
last visit was less satisfactory to the artist,
though it filled the business man’s pocket-
book with cheques. He worked at the high
speed of one who had so many acres of
canvas to cover before the short winter days
closed in. Commissions poured upon him.
He painted social celebrities —the artificial
elegance of Lady Dudley, turned obediently
to catch the right light as John in his
butcher-blue overall (which he grew to hate
as part of the rush) visualised the lady’s
delicate aquiline nose and chocolate-brown
eyes. He painted Prof. Andy Stuart’s por-
trait, gay as any macaw in plumage of stiff
red and blue silk and that added another
picture to the National Gallery’s Australian
court.
Mrs. Aldous C. Arnold, a Sydney woman
whose husband commands the Australian
Camel Field Ambulance, is doing war work
in England. She’s a sister attached to
Queen Mary’s Hospital for Armless and Leg-
less Soldiers and Sailors —a billet that needs
all the Australian sunshine one of its daugh-
ters can infuse.
The cards are out for Nancy Chisholm’s
wedding. The happy soldier is Ivan Young,
lieut., not so long home from the Front. It’s
to be on March 20. Nancy is one of the
Goulburn sisters who have been amongst the
city’s most persistent Red Cross workers.
The Australian V.A.D.'s who left here 18
months or more ago—-Enid Armstrong and
Adele Brennan were with those white aprons
—recently got a Red Stripe of Honor apiece.
This badge of efficiency is the British Mili-
tary Hospital’s recognition of devotion to
duty. They’ve been attached to a haven for
wounded in Leicestershire.
Here is a little
photo, of a busy man
who makes a recrea-
tion of writing books
about Australian
timber. It. T. Baker
is Curator and Eco-
nomic Botanist at
the Sydney Tech.
Museum, and has a
crowded lair in a
dusty purlieu of
Ultimo, where he
does simply tremen-
dous things not only
for economic botany
but for Australia.
After 25 years he has
almost got us to be-
lieve that our forests
are fit for soniething
besides the firestick. “In hardwoods we can
beat America,” he says, tenderly handling a
specimen in the big timber court; “and for
tannin, thanks to the black pine, we are
independent of the world. The essential oils
and other qualities of the eucalypts of East-
ern Australia, embracing about three-fourths
of our big vegetation, make this genus of
plants the greatest forestry asset of the
Commonwealth. When the average Aus-
tralian learns to see a towering gum with-
out itching for an axe to chop it down, he
will have become a true lover of his country.”
An authority jOn timbers, the Gov.-General,
is making a collection of Australian woods,
and when in Sydney the Tech. Museum is
one of his haunts. When the war eame,
Germany, looking (as usual) ahead, declared
pit-props contraband. This was a blow aimed
at Britain’s coal-mines. Soon the shortage
showed signs of becoming acute, and many
British timber plantations gave up their splen-
dor. Amongst the biggest hauls was that
which carried a cheque for £50,000 to Sir
Ronald Ferguson. Yet the forest of Douglas
firs that brought this sum was a stony Scot-
tish hillside 40 years ago.
Lady Galway’s son, Lieut. d’Erlanger, is
due in Sydney. He was invalided home to
mother in S. Aus., got better and is shortly
off to have another whack at Fritz:., This
time he’s going to drop souvenirs on that
furriner’s thick head.
Little Madeline Clarke, the Brisbane press-
girl who went to China and Japan and
thereabouts with the Freddy Shipman vaude-
ville eo., is home again. She’s in town for
a day or two before going back to Queens-
land. Madeline, who is five-feet-notMng in
her .dippers, was the first woman to “go
ahead,” alone, in China and Japan'. “The
East” opened its almond eyes a trifle wider
when the small bundle of energy arrived in
out-of-the-way towns and started to get things
ready. “But the kindness of everyone (I
loved my job, mind, and never knew nervous-
ness) and the special courtesy of British
consuls —why, I couldn’t tell the tale in a
week,” enthuses Madeline. Mrs. Shipman, a
devoted daughter, got a cable from Chicago
to hurry her home owing to her father’s ill-
ness. So she had to leave us at Shanghai.”
The company went where it listed at the end
of the contract. Madeline booked for home
and mother, but stuck for about nine days
on a coral reef ISO miles north of Cooktown.
After being hauled off, the steamer met the
full blast of the Townsville tropichl disturb-
ance, and did about tw T o knots an hour? But
all’s well now.
There’s a new hon. matron at Rose Hall
convalescent home for sojers. Miss Fox, its
first and only chieftainess hitherto, gives up
after a long spell of hard work. The just-
appointed head is Miss Preston.
Home on short furlough, Flight-lieu t.
Kingsford Smith, a Mosman boy, ,only 20.
owning a Military Cross and a foot-wound.
Young Smith saw Gallipoli as a private, but
the air service caught his fancy, and he now
has wings in the R.F.C. A brother is secre-
tary to the O.C. of Garden Island. ,
About two years ago Dr. Charles Lloyd,
an English musician, came this way as
examiner for the Royal Academy, jgince
then a brilliant Sydney pianist, F. S, Kelly,
has been killed in action. Lloyd, who was.
as precentor at a big English school, in touch
with the Australian’s boyish aspirations in
music, has written an Elegy to his
memory. This was the “special” played by
Ernest Truman at a Town Hall organ reci-
tal the other afternoon.
Billjim’s younger brothers, Australia’s
first batch of midshipmen, are now well
established with the Grand Fleet. They are
split up amongst five ships, and most of
them have been chosen for special duty,
while one has already kept his last watch.
They don’t like the North Sea winter, but
revel in their work. One of them, follow-
ing a period of mine-sweeping, went to Lon-
don and voyaged across the Big Smoke
many times by balloon during his aerial
observation course. He was subsequently
sent to the Lucia, a submarine training-ship,
and describes the work as “priceless.”
The success of girls in the “hardier” sub-
jects at the recent Sydney leaving certifi-
cate exam, has caused a rustle in the high-
schools. At botany 16 girls took all the
honors; in geology four girls had the only
passes; at zoology three girls took the
honors; and one youth who shared honors
with four gii’ls in physiology was a novelty.
And there is a girleen who took honors in a
country exam, recently in agriculture and
farm work !
A Sayidali Revue—it catches its title from
the Arab greeting—is part of the April cam-
paign for the Red Cross. It is booked for
the King’s Cross Theatre, Darlinghurst, on
Tuesday in Easter Week. Minnie Everett
is hon. adviser to the amateurs who are to
do the Sayidahing; and Mrs. Ashton, Helen
Macarthur Onslow and Anthony Street are
the hon. secs.
Prawn parties are local sassiety’s latest
recreation. There was one at Rose Bay a
little while ago, when our loveliest got into
glorified surf-costume and waded into the
water that lapped the foot of the garden.
Hefty young “sports”—carrying lanterns—
also stemmed the current with their brawny
limbs. A fair haul was the result. The
prawners then retired to cook the little shell-
backs as part of the entertainment. Some-
one inadvertently blew up the bath-heater in
the course of warming-up after the chill sea-
weedy wade.
“Pompoms everywhere,” says an ecstatic
Australian overseas, after glueing her fea-
tures to London shop-windows. This means,
of course, the fluffy knobs on the winter hats,
and the same as a finish to the new coat-
mantles. But may the plump be preserved
from the folly of a pompom on their expan-
sive corsages!
“Newfoundland” still rolls off the Gover-
nor’s tongue if he isn’t watching himself,
and “this great State of New—found-land”
came tripping along in one of his Ex.’s
recent Hospital speeches. (Jiggles brought
a hurried New —South Wales to the rescue.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

GOOD DIGESTION WITHOUT
MEDICINE.
UNIVERSAL ADOPTION OF ANTACID
THEORY.
In the old days pain in the stomach after
eating or inability to retain food, variously
known as dyspepsia, indigestion or gastritis,
called for the taking of powerful pain-killing
drugs or useless and expensive artificial
digestants; the usual result being big medi-
cine bills and an irreparably damaged
stomach and intestinal tract. Modern en-
lightened research has changed all this. It
has shown conclusively that acid and fer-
mentation, which irritate and inflame the
delicate stomach lining, is the direct cause
of most of the trouble. Specialists therefore
nowadays, instead of giving medicines and
drugs, follow the more logical plan of neu-
tralising the dangerous acid by taking imme-
diately after eating, in a little water, half a
teaspoonful of a form of magnesia prepared
especially for stomach use, and known among
chemists as bisurated magnesia. This
quickly neutralises the acid, stops food fer-
mentation, and makes the food contents
bland and sweet, thus permitting the stomach
to proceed with its work without hindrance
and under normal conditions. Try it and
see for yourself, but be sure that you get the
genuine bisurated magnesia.—Advt.

My Dear Yabrie, —
The old Chief Justice went as he would
have wished. There were no long farewells,
no moaning at the bar. In the midst of a
game with the children—he was in some
ways still a child at 1 4—the Messenger
called. John Madden died practically with
little baby Jowett on his knee.
Before leaving for Sydney, the stormy
Mannix, quieter than a lamb these balmy days
of early autumn, has been spending part of
his three months’ holiday at Queenscliff.
There he distinguished himself from other
visiting sky-pilots by invariably wearing his
canonicals, in season and out of season, even
when right amongst the neck-to-knee contin-
gent on the beaches. Somebody asked the
archiepiscopal bodyguard if his Gracious
wouldn’t like to tear ’em off now and again
and take a dip. “Ah, no,” was the solemn
reply, “the Archbishop never bathes.”
Mrs. Merson Cooper and Mrs. Barry
Thompson did a little preliminary bushrang-
ing at Menzies’ last Thursday for Our Boys’
Day. They sold dowers and kewpies at
Kelly Gang prices to. visiting racing men.
Please drop a line to the anonymous sender
of the dowers and thank him (or her) for
his (or her) beautiful donation. Sam Hor-
dern, Captain Waters and the Bruntons were
easy marks; and Sam Mackay, from West-
ralia, dung down a fiver for a tiny bottle of
scent.
The Stock Exchange is usually invaded by
pretty bushrangers on patriotic days. This
time, for Our Boys’ Day, ’Change means to
take a hand itself. ’Change members, with
Mrs. ’Change helping, will have a kiosk out-
side and a theatrical entertainment indoors.
The principal stars have promised to shine.
Mrs. Bail lieu and Mrs. Fred Knight will
supervise the kiosk.
The last night of the Whittington panto,
went off with a fizz and a bang for a packed
house. Bob Whiting, with his diminutive
spouse, and Rupert Clarke had a pen. The
Geoff. Symes, with a representative collec-
tion from their nursery, snuggled down in
the opposite box. The aftermath of the Nan
O’Hara-liill wedding wandered in about
half-time, and scattered through the
house were Mrs. Norman Ealkiner, Mrs.
John Osborne and Mavis Thiel, Gordon
Chirnside’s fiancee. Plump and debonair
Eeonore Eddington had a khaki escort.
Maggie Dickinson’s “Cheer Oh” stunt evoked
whirlwinds, and the cast came in for much
cheering. The usual floral finale eventu-
ated, and the cost of the vegetables would
have stocked a Y.M.C.A. hut for soldiers.
Vera Pearce stood in a lily-starred doorway,
with “Our Vera” plastered on it. Maggie
Dickinson and Sidney Yates scored two
kewpies dressed a la vogue, whilst other
bouquet recipients tried for that “didn’t-
know-it-was-coming” expression—and failed
badly.
A social tragedy of last week was the
death of Dr. Cairns Lloyd’s young and
pretty wife, who collapsed on the operating
table. She was a daughter of late wealthy
woolgrower Scott, who formerly owned the
William Leonards’ Toorak home. After
their parents’ death the two younger Scott
chicks went to London to live with a
married sister. The elder of the pair re-
turned a few' years ago as the bride of Dr.
Cairns Lloyd, who is a nephew of Mrs.
Robert Harper. She leaves a small son and
daughter.
Mrs. William Officer passed out very sud-
denly at her husband’s squattage the other
Saturday. She had been in bad health for
years and died in her sleep. The deceased
lady, who, in the ’Bo’s was famed for her
beautiful figure, was a sister of V.R.C.
starter Norman Wilson. She leaves two
sons. One married shortly before war broke
out, and the other wears a reject badge.
The youngest of the late Admiral Bridges’s
chicks has been tied up in Blighty with a
Canadian, Colonel Wilson. The Bridges
widow was a Wilson, but daughter Marjorie’s
soldier belongs to a different tribe. The
bride is dark, pretty and well-dollared. Her
wedding happened just a few weeks after
sister Alfreda changed her name to Share.
Nan O’Hara was altared to Mrs. Hill at
Christ Church last week. She walked through
her part in a long-trained white satin gown
trimmed with silver and lace, and sister
Betty wore a veil over her bridesmaid's
frock. Only relations were invited—but the
O’Hara relations are legion. Elder sister
Mrs. Rowan (she is a large likeness of Clara
Butt) was a prominent help in the cere-
monies. Big bluff surgeon dad wept tem-
peramental tears at parting with one of his
colleens. The bride and ’groom got away
quietly and the wedding party went out en
masse to the races, where they lunched and
afternoon-teaed merrily, and created a sensa-
tion at one of the theatres in the evening.
Pretty little Nan’s man is a Bananalander.
His station is adjacent to sister Mrs.
Rowan’s place, so the Melbourne girl will
not be lonely.
Gwen Warnock is now Mrs. Wharton, of
Bananaland. She was married in the chapel
of the English Grammar School on the wet
(sth to her returned soldier. Eieut. Wharton
had another returned soldier, Captain Fusel,
as groomsman, and 20 more returned men
formed a guard of honor for his bride. They
made an arch of their crossed swords (ail
the swords had been carried to battle, if not
actually used). The bride was the prettiest
thing—dark as a gipsy. She wore a soft
Georgette dress of a very faint pink tint,
pleated in flat straight pleats into small
wreaths of embroidered baby-roses; also a
big Gainsboro’ hat. (The wedding was
at eight in the evening, but that old
fashion-note of St. Paul’s about women’s
covered heads has never been repealed.)
Sister Leila Warnock, in a duck of a dress
all pinks and blues, and a big black hat, was
the only bridesmaid. The church was full of
khaki.
Mrs. M. M. Phil-
lips’s novel, “The
White Feather,” is
making a hit. The
scene is laid in Mel-
bourne and suburbs
—a territory which
the writer has good
reason to know, since
her grandfather got
in by the early door,
and her father,
Angel Ellis, was
bo r n here. Angel
Ellis died about a
year at the age
of S 3. He remem-
bered the first subur-
ban railway, and
was one of the pas-
sengers in the first
—they all had to get out and push.
Mrs. Phillips has been writing short-stories
for years and getting them published under
the name of “Philip Ray,” and The Bul-
letin, Lone Hand and Australasian have
all written their favorable criticisms of her
work on cheque forms. Her sister, Ada Ellis,
a talented woman who wrote much, was one
of the first Melbourne girls to get her Uni-
versity degree. “The White Feather” is
Mrs. Phillips’s first effort at a long story.
An attack of appendicitis was followed by
weeks of convalescence on a verandah, and
the energetic woman employed the enforced
rest in finishing her big work. Her husband,
to whom the book is dedicated, is chief clerk
and taxing-master of the Supreme Court, and
in his spare time a well-known figure in
Shakspearean circles and literary rings and
combines.
It is a good job there is some use for
swords. Until the other day (and I suppose
it is so still) every Australian officer was
supplied with a blade—and the thing with
its fixings must cost three or four pounds.
Of course nobody nowadays ever employs a
sword in action ; the use of the encumbrance
is purely ceremonial, and for that a man
can always borrow. So one of the first
things the non-swanking Australian officer
did when he got to Egypt in the old days
was to mislay his sword. You could find the
wretched things hidden under carpets and
buried in the sand. That’s where some of
the £200,000,000-odd which the war has cost
us has gone.
Madam Adelaida’s inset:—
The Auditor-General’s overhaul of the Repatria-
tion Fund accounts brings to light the fact that the
Returned Soldiers’ Toy Factory, which cost £9OO to
establish, dropped £538 between October, 1916, and
the following June. If somebody would now deter-
mine where the work of the South Aus. Soldiers’ Fund
ends and that of the Repatriation Fund begins, he
might help the cause of economy by eliminating
overlapping.
Frederick Halcomb, M.A., clerk of the Leg. Coun-
cil, is about to retire. He is 82, and he and good
health have lately not been on the best of terms.
His successor, J. C. Morphett, is 74. Alfred Searcy,
64, and J. P. Morice, 61, both take a step up. There
is no “too old at 40” about the S.A. Parliamentary
officials.
Greece has still her stalwarts. Behold Demetrius
Emmanuel! In Hindley-street on Saturday night he
attacked a fellow countryman’s fish-shop with a limb
torn off a tree, shattered both windows, battered the
fish to pulp, and, when arrested, valiantly fought
eight policemen more or less successfully from Hind-
ley-street to the watch-house. Horatius would have
made things even more willing at the bridge if the
good Demetrius had stood by his right hand.
Peter Dawson has announced a farewell concert
about Easter, and his friends and relations are pre-
paring a reception that will be a theme for the
oldest inhabitant in time to come. Peter was born
in Adelaide, and in his young days was more noted
for divilment than voice. Still, even as a very small
youngster he was in St. Andrew’s choir. You know
he is going into camp very soon. Though he has
been a star for a dozen years he is still on the right
side of 36.
To the Catholic Federation on Wednesday Arch-
bishop Spence, referring to Dr. Mannix, said that
“they might travel not only the whole of Australia
but the whole of the wide world and not meet a
more peaceable man.” And his Grace never batted
an eye, either.
After a four years’ hiatus the Royal Agricultural
and Horticultural Society is holding a two-days’ Show
in exceptionally fine weather. The town, is full of
Mallee cousins, and the shops are reaping harvest.
Frederick Young, our retiring Agent-General, has
joined the London Board of the Bank of Adelaide.
Perhaps London fogs suit his rheumatism.
The hotelkeepers of South Aus. have presented the
V.A.D.’s with a cinematograph plant for use in the
large shed at the Outer Harbor. The Film Supply
Co. will provide films, and Wondergraph and West’s
will detail operators. It is a little compliment
(costing £3OO, by the way) that the V.A.D.’s well
deserve, their work being too little appreciated.
H. S. Power, who did all his early work in
Adelaide, and has a horse-picture in the Gallery there,
has also a battle-painting on its walls just now, lent
by Surgeon-Major Bollen. It shows an Australian
advanced dressing-station on the Somme, all plastered
earth (rather roughly painted) in the foreground,
and battle-smoke at the back. . Heavyweight men,
with Lindsay faces, are giving or receiving attention,
and German prisoners file out of a trench bearing
more wounded. With unusual restraint, Power has
allowed himself only one horse, and naturally it is
the best thing in the crowded picture.
Major Jack Dyer is now in command of
the A.I.F. Engineers’ Depot, at Brittlingsea,
Essex. At the end of 1917 he received his
D.S.O. and gave a diamond ring to a pretty
English girl who hails from Northampton.
Mervyn Forrest, son of David and nephew
of Bigjohn, is on honeymoon in Melbourne
and has promenaded with his bride »t Flein-
ington. He married Madge Corthope, a
Westralian lassie. They have already
'mooned in the Apple Island and Sydney,
and are now returliing west.
There was great to-do over a christening
at St. Pat’s last week. Captain and Mrs.
Forrest’s first-born appeared in an all-lace
robe and cap made for him by the nuns of
the Abbostford; (Convent. Grandmother Mrs.
Forrest, from Charters Towers, was a proud
dapie. She was one of the recognised beau-
ties of her day when she came from Ireland
to marry the Bananaland doctor, and she has
not lost her good looks. She stood god-
mother to her grandson, and grandfather
Michael Monaine was godfather.
Mrs. Harold Russell came over from Syd-
ney for the races, and suffered an appalling
loss during the journey. Her luggage dis-
appeared, and she had to rush round Mel-
bourne and buy ready-made clothes. A real
tragedy when you see the way the Sydney
women dress to kill their Melbourne sisters
with envy. The late John Downer’s dame,
who was one of the Russell girls, is over for
all events from Adelaide.
The deferred Australian Cup, washed off
its sacred Tuesday by oceans of rain, was
run in perfect weather on Thursday. Pal-
freyman (he owns, or partly owns, Defence
and races under a nom-de- Flemington) was
in high fettle, and became the willing victim
of the women who were bushranging for Our
Boys’ Day. His donations were quite regal.
The Downer lady (Adelaide) was out, and
Mrs. Harold Russell, from Sydney, looked
charming in pale-green duds, in spite of lost
luggage. Young soldier Lewis was there
without mother, though Elliott Lewis is over
from the Apple Island for the races. Mrs.
Sam Mackay, from the West, looked about
18 in a soft dark dress and a big shady hat.
The Motts, from Bananaland, were with a
big batch of men from Cloncurry way. Squat-
ter Dick (six-foot-six in his socks, but, of
course, he had his boots on) excitedly dis-
cussed with them the results of a Meat Price
deputation he had led that morning to the
Minister. Cattle Kidman, solemn and grey,
genially distributed prize bullocks to busy
workers for Our Boys’ Day. Mrs. Pohlman
got one. Mrs. Burragh pocketed another, and
Mrs. Rogers Tompson collected a third.
Racing Shepherd’s daughter was with Mrs.
Sternberg. Muriel Forrest North chanced a
cold and a new cloth costume, and went
without Auntie and Uncle Bigjohn. Dr. and
Mrs. Osborne were over from Sydney. Sister
Mrs. Wilkinson wandered over the lawn in a
Glory Quayle sort of dress of blue stocking-
ette in the new “jumper” style.
Mrs. Waters, from Sydney 5 strolled in the
simple glorv of a white Parisian gown, and
wore her famous necklace of pearls. The
gaud has 68 peas of special splendor and
lustre. The beautiful thing is a temptation
to every jewel thief in Australia and the
envy of all women. Hubby is a pearl enthu-
siast and has gathered the gems for his lady
because she scorns other jewels. No other
woman caught so many eyes on the lawn.
Stewart Brunton was with his wife in white
cloth. The frocky Denison lady returned to
Sydney before the postponed race could be
run.
Flemington was crowded for the third
afternoon of the meeting. It was a Satui’day
holiday crowd, dowdy and domesticated.
Children were sprinkled about the fashion-
able grandstands, whei-e they munched fruit
and biscuits and made all tilings feel like a
glue-factory. Even the size barred in
theatre advertisements wei’e there, woollen
shawls, squalls and all.
The fashion abroad kept mostly to the
saddliug-paddock. Mrs. Danvers (W.A.)
carried an acreage of eye-veiling tulle round
her neck and wore an embroidei’ed tunic di’ess
and a hat topped with dyed emu feathers.
Mrs. Lowry stewed gently in a duck of an
ermine cape, while her husband’s Desert
Cold gave a flying exhibition in the Gover-
nor’s Plate. Mrs. Fi-ed Thiel wore brown to
match her eyes. Daughter Mavis, fair and
debonair in chintz and blue print, accepted
congratulations on her engagement to Gordon
Chirnside, who is away in France. Mrs.
Geoffrey Syxne was a cool picture in pale
pastel ninons. Mrs. Aubrey Campbell was
in the much-favored chocolate color. Mrs.
Mills wdi-e a bright-green hat on top of a
fawn dress; but Mrs. Jack Wallace had a
paddy-green hat that was even brighter.
She backed Wallace Isinglass in silk stock-
ings of the Wallace plaid. Mrs. Waters, fi-om
Sydney, was a vision in heavy blue serge
tailorings and a glorified Tam-o’-shanter with
a pink-purple thistle embroidered in wool
clamped on to her golden hair. The vice-
regal pen was handed over to disabled khaki.
Mrs. Leslie Stuart’s dance on Australian
Cup night was the sensation of race week.
It began as an informal “telephone” frivol
for young people just to say good-bye to
Char Crespin and Bill Baillieu, who are
going back to the trenches after a spell.
Every girl who didn't get an invitation was
pouting all through the races.
Ida Rentoul Outhwaite’s show of work
was due to begin on Tuesday. Black-and-
white and colored drawings are in the bill.
Ida was responsible for the designs of the
Butterfly Ballet in “Dick Whittington.”
Yours sincerely.
JOHANNA.

THE TOP NOTCH SCOTCH
A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“6262”: This is the way to get a good
edge on an old blunt razor. Open it and attach one
end of a piece of string about 3ft.. long to the heel
of the blade in such a manner that it will balance
horizontally with the cutting edge downwards. Tie
the other end of the string to your gas bracket, or
to the ridge-pole of your tent, and let the razor
hang there undisturbed. If not influenced by wind
or by the twist of the string (which can easily be
teased out) it will come to rest finally with the
blade pointing to the magnetic north. A mass of
metal near it may, however, deflect it. Leave it for
two or three days, and it will then be ready for
comfortable use without stropping.
A MERE TRIFLE.
WWARDSMAN : “ ’Ere you are , mate, hop into this bed. The bloke that had it died this
morn in'.”
SICK SOLDIER : “What did he die of?”
WARDSMAN : “Oh, nothing serious.”
“Tarlton II.”: Nobody has yet explained
clearly to a recent inquiring novice how to distin-
guish the male magpie from the female during
infancy. So here’s the dinkum recipe. Observe the
shade of grey on the back and the shape of the
bill. The male is darker until he survives the moult,
when 12 months old ; the back then becomes white.
The female is lighter-colored, with a white edge to
the grey behind the head, but the back never alters.
Both have dark bills for the first five months, then
that of the male pales rapidly and at nine months
ia white with a blue-black tip. The female cannot
blanch her bill under 12 months. In section the
male’s picker is oblong, whereas the female’s bill
is almost square. Even when hungry Jack makes less
noise than Jill.
“87": Be “Billy Blue” (B. 18/10/T7) and
Ills Bullocky Bill with the box of tampered brandy.
I know a similar case. When my unit left the Nile
and pushed into the heart of the desert to catch the
Senussi army in the rear, I was left behind as
C.Q.M.S. A week later two men came back by
train (a narrow-gauge railway probed the desert for
70 miles) with a letter from my 0.0. instructing me
to give the bearers two cases of whisky. The men
returned with the medicine the next morning, but
the train was slow and the thirst great, and the
Billjims helped themselves to a bottle out of one of
the cases. Instead of pulling out the cork in the
usual way, they broke the bottle over a billycan and
replaced the broken glass in its straw envelope.
Another bottle was treated in a similar manner.
Later on water was poured over the straw. At the
journey’s end Bill explained that owing to the rock-
ing of the train a case had fallen overboard and
the contents were, he was afraid, badly damaged.
The officer was probably thankful for what rem lined.
* * * *
“F.Y.7”: That yarn about the swaggie
who was treed with his dog for four days by the
Rockhampton flood recalls the case of Mrs. Flynn, of
Donga mail change, Southern Queensland. When the
Balonne and the Warrcgo come down together a great
dampness is apt to prevail in that part of the
country. Recognising this, when the waters first
put in an appearance in ’93, Mis. Flynn, who was a
very large and capable Irishwoman, took to a tree
which had previously been well provisioned. The
domestic live-stock, including two rosella parrots, two
small black pigs, an odd lot of fowls and Mr. Flynn,
were also installed in the tree, which was a big,
straggling coolabah, and there they all remained for
nearly 10 days until the waters subsided. The missus
rather enjoyed it, and used to say that but for the
trouble given her by the pigs and Mr. Flynn, who
were continually complaining; she wouldn’t mind
another holiday just like it.
“G. Arden Hill” ;• Plagues of mice, grass-
hoppers, weevils, locusts, etc., are common enough
in Australia, but a plague of bees is unusual. South
Coast (N.S.W.) cordial manufacturers have lately
been complaining bitterly of the depletion of their
syrup stocks owing to the depredation of such insects.
Nor is this all. A Wollongong cordial manufacturer
declares that he has suffered a serious loss of trade
owing to 11 of his employees having been incapaci-
tated at times through stings. He advances the
theory that the exceptionally heavy rains on the
coast (25in. fell during January and February)
have washed the honey out of the blossoms, and the
bees have no alternative but to raid his premises in
order to replenish their tanks.
FORCE OF HABIT.
NEWS SUB-EDITOR (to cable ditto who has had a belligerent visitor) : “Great Scott he
has knocked you out.”
CABLE SUB. (ex-war-correspondent) : “Not at alt. He merely gained a temporary
advantage—of no real value—at enormous loss to himself.” (Collapse.)
“Griff”: Add another to the list of cures
for tick-fever in eats and dogs. Give the sufferer
a drench of a teaspoonful of painkiller in milk
when he is seen to be getting weak in the hind-
quarters, not forgetting, of course, to remove the
ticks. Two or three doses of this will set him up.
I have cured not only cats and dogs with this
remedy, but on several occasions foals as old as 12
months. As with griped horses the battle is prac-
tically over when the pain is beaten.
“Steve Hart”: Now that some Billjims
are getting on to the land I’m doing a good turn
by introducing. them to the tree lucerne as the best
utility scrub to grow. It is ornamental anywhere;
flowers profusely in the winter, providing bees with
honey when they want it most; the flowers drop
millions of seedpods, which provide the fowls with
a good egg-producing food; and at any time you can
take the axe to it and give Cherry and Brindle or
the jumbucks a succulent fodder, which they eat
greedily and do well on. It grows high enough to
give a good shade, and will sprout anywhere, except-
ing in a wet situation. It grows very quickly.
Seeds are cheap and require boiling water poured
over them, then left soaking for 12 hours. Plant
in flower-pots, jam-tins or any old thing from which
they can be transplanted to permanent quarters.
* * * *
“Church Street”: Swans and ducks are
following the example of the human race in Vic.,
and leaving the country for the city. Swans fish
for their living among the motor-boats and smells
in the Yarra, and Richmond goes shooting swans
and ducks in the quarry-holes. It’s a dangerous
sport, too; one citizen who had shot a swan in a
quarry-hole at South Richmond was drowned while
he was trying to get it out the other day.
* ' * * *
“Douglas T.” : While trying to coax a fin
out of the river at Barham (N.S.W.) I noticed, in
a red-gum, a symmetrical-looking nest. I wanted
to shin up that old gum at once, but climbing is a
lost art at 80. Next morning I ascertained it was
a magpie’s nest, made almost entirely of the thin
wire used in tying up sheaves of hay. But to get
back to fish. It is strange that the Fisheries" De-
partment does not give greater encouragement to the
destruction of cormorants. These pests consume
five full meals every 24 hours, and in these times
when everything eatable is of importance it seems
criminal to let the gluttonous divers get so much.
A party of five men on the Wakool (an outflow «f
the Murray) seme time ago killed nearly 1000 in
trees where they had made nests. A small
allowance is, I believe, made by the Department, but
it is not enough to tempt anyone to waste time and
cartridges. I’ll tell you about the fish later on.
“Konini” : Flies have a sense of color, and
in my experience they damn blue. A friend of mine
in Taranaki (M.L.), who lives for his cows, dis-
covered that in one shed which had a decorative
scheme in blue the madames' were not fly-pestered.
So he painted all the sheds with this solution: 20gals.
water, 101 b. slacked lime and lib. of ultramarine.
That, lie declares, settled the fly curse.
“Ritasun” : How many young ones does a
black snake have at a birth ? While fishing in the
Big Trickle the other day an Elmore (Vic.) returned
soldier killed-, a lady of the species who had corked
up 45 snakelets, one of them with two heads. The
freak is being sent to the Bendigo Museum, in Billy
Hughes's constituency. Freaks are a great institution
with the Bendigo people.
“Bad Australian”: The ignorant South
American is doing his level best to encourage the
growth of the very tree that the scrub Australian
cockatoo regards as a curse and impediment to pro-
gress. It is only about 20 years since the euca-
CAMOUFLAGE.
lyptus was planted to
any extent in S. America,
but during that time the
plantations both for or-
nament and utility have
increased to an astonish-
ing extent, particularly
in Chile and Argentina.
Go where you will in the
southern part of the
country you are rarely
out of sight of a grove
o f gum-trees, which
seem to flourish a s
well as in their
native soil. Even in
Southern Peru, Bolivia
and Paraguay the
eucalypts do well, and I
have seen one blue-ghm
nearly three feet in diam-
eter in a little oasis in
the Desert of Atacama,
its topmost branches wav-
ing at just about 9000 ft. above the Pacific.
* * * *
“Hard Up, Esq.” : Add this to the collec-
tion. In front of the Foresters’ Hall, Broadmeadows
(Vic.), is a hollow iron lamp-post with a small hole
about 3ft. from the ground. Five months ago a
swarm of bees took possession of the cylinder, and
have since been perspiring to get together a shipment
of honey. Also, under the flooring of the local police-
station a tribe of bees have hived for some years.

DON’T DRUG YOUR NERVES.
IF THEY ARE WEAK TAKE PHOS-
PHATE WITH YOUR MEALS.
Some drugs lessen the sensitiveness of the
nervous system so that the brain acts slowly,
the nerves do not respond readily to the
directions of the brain, and every function of
the body is retarded. Others act as a lash
to the nerves, so that the user is fired tem-
porarily with feverish energy. Both are
equally dangerous, for there is the inevitable
reaction which leaves the sufferer far .worse
than before. Therefore, don’t drug your
nerves! Get to understand them and study
their needs. Nerves give way because they
are weak, and they become weak through
lack of food and nourishment. The futility
of thrashing a starved horse is obvious, and
it is just as futile and just as foolish to
lash weak, exhausted nerves by the adminis-
tration of violent drugs. Nerves feed on
phosphate, which they extract from digested
food, and the fact that your nerves are weak
proves they are not obtaining sufficient
phosphate for their needs. You can remedy
this serious fault by providing your nerves
with phosphate in a readily assimilable form,
a most suitable and convenient being bitro-
phosphate, which most chemists stock in the
form of 5-grain compressed tablets. Take
one of these small tablets immediately after
every meal and you will soon note a decided
improvement in your health. Your neiwes
will become steady and strong, your brain
will act quickly and clearly; your app°t : te
will improve ; you will sleep better, a u 1 wake
un br ; ght and refreshed, charged -v m an
abundance of vital energy snffi- io y
you through the most strenuous day.-Any T.
“Azack”: Can any apiarist explain why
it is that when bees leave the hive it is the custom
to ling a bell or belt a tin-can in the middle of the
moving mass? It is asserted by those who follow
this procedure that the noise causes the bees to
swarm again, so that they can be recaptured. * This
explanation appears to be wanting when it is known
that bees have no sense of hearing (entomologists
reckon so, anyhow). One story is that in ancient
days, when a swarm of bees left their hive, the
owner kicked up some kind of a row for the purpose
of letting his neighbors know that some of his
property was on the move, whereupon if it swarmed
on their property he was entitled to reclaim it, hav-
ing given notice. This yarn seems as good as any
other that offers.
“Leo Lear” : These are open to competi-
tion: (1) A ewe owned by Sandy Graham, Milltown
(West Vie.). In eight consecutive years she in-
creased the birth rate by 2,3, 4,2, 3,2, 3, 3—22 in
all —and would have had four this year if she hadn’t
died before the event. (2) A Beach Forrest sow
belonging to O. W. Jackson. In four years she has
mothered six litters numbering in all 101—12, 16,
20, 16, 16, 21. Finally (3) on Mr. W. Hawkin’s
farm, Trafalgar, three cows which have each had
twins; and they all blame the same gentleman !
* * * *
“Barcoo”: It’s correct that Brookong
(locally called Bluegong) shed in Riverina (N.S.W.)
had 104 stands in the early ’Bo’s, the good old blade
days. There were other sheds that had just about
a hundred men on the board —and one, at least, con-
tiguous to Brookong, had 101. Those cumbersome
gangs went out when the machines came in. Large
sheds were cut down 50 per cent, in stands. North-
ampton, on the Barcoo (Q.), put in 70 machines, and
the first year the barbers threw 10,800 jumbucks
down the chutes in one day—a record —and well on
to 10,000 every full working day. Wool was piled
in heaps as high as the shed in all directions, and
the operators were repeating their performance at the
next shed while the pressers cleared the accumula-
tion. Bowen Downs (Q.) was turning off between
8000 and 9000 woollies every day. It was quite
unnecessary, and very few sheds run 40 machines
nowadays.

“E.S.S.”: I heartily endorse “Jimmie
Pannikin’s’’ observations re planting Australian trees
and flowers in school grounds (B. 14/2/’18). Most
of these dust-heaps are a disgrace to the Department.
If native trees, the glory and pride of our land,
appreciated and admired the world over except by
the Bumbles here, were planted round the boun-
daries, what a transformation there would be!
Besides being beautiful and useful in providing shade,
they would be instructive, and in time a valuable
commercial asset. I have a wild cherry-tree growing
in front of my house, and I don't think there is
another vegetable in Sydney that attracts so much
notice from passers-by as that good Australian. At
Undereliff (Sydney), where many workers have
made natty homes amid the rocks and scrub, the
fronts are planted with Christmas bush, banksia,
waratah, tea-tree, blueberry, wattle and others lifted
from the neighboring bush. Long may they live!

CAMBEWARRA BILLY: “Good day, Missus!”

CAMBEWARRA BILLY: “Baal Misser Edxoards
gentleman. Baal that phella raise it hat
long a my Mary!”
I would plant native trees along all the main roads
wherever timber is scarce. We owe some such repara-
tion to posterity for the vast wealth that has been
fired, ringbarked and otherwise destroyed.
A CORNISH MAN’S HOLIDAY.
“Ded ’ee go to poor Billy’s funeral last week, Josiah?”
“I ded.”
“What soort turnout ded ’e ’ave?”
“Bootiful! There teas seventy-one carts, leavin’ out the ’earse, and twenty-nine singers,
’eludin’ meself. I tell ’ee, I doan’ knaw whenever I enjoyed a funeral more.”
“Malaria”;: Wanted, a recipe for keeping
malarial fever at a distance. I’ve been trading to
the Tropics for years, and had a spell of five months
(ashore and afloat) in the Papuan Government ser-
vice. During that time, which in-
cluded the rainy season, I visited
many places on the Coast and ad-
jacent islands, and went up every
river and creek of note. I’ve camped
in the bush and on seashores where
the mosquitoes were as thick as rain-
drops, and I’ve been in those early-
morning tropical mists that I’ve read
are deadly, yet not once did I show
any traces of malarial fever, and I
did not take any quinine to ward off
possible attacks. Then in ’l4 I went to
Rabaul, and was ashore for only an hour
one night when I fell down to malaria
and stayed down for a week. Last
November I again visited Rabaul,
Everything went O.K. till we struck
cool weather on the way back, when
I was off duty for four watches with
the old complaint. When it started
I imbibed a 20-grain dose of bi-sul-
phate of quinine and several hot
drinks, and covered me over with five
blankets. Sweat did the rest. On
the next trip, from the day we struck
tropical weather till the day we
quitted it, five and sometimes 10
grains were my daily dose of quinine,
and I had no trouble at all. Now
it’s on the subject of quinine-dosing that I’m
looking for tips. Some men dose themselves
every day, and malaria gives them the go-by ; others
refuse to dose, and they fare the same; others, again,
dose themselves moderately, and still they’re not free
from trouble.

“Leo Lear”: The native bear makes one
of the tamest and most affectionate pets of any native
animal we possess; but all bushmen know that its
life in captivity is short. I often wondered why.
Now I know. Norman Lindsay's pals die of appen-
dicitis. Darwin says they possess the longest appen-
dix known, sometimes three times the length of the
little fellow’s body.
“Melos”: When tired of pate de foie gras
and other minor delicacies try a serving of fried
gohanna or roast porcupine. The former tastes some-
what like first-chop chicken, the latter even better.
Black brother prepared the dishes in this way. The
go’ was slit from throat to butt of tail, small sticks
inserted in the opening to keep the flaps, well apart,
and the carcase placed on live coals. The two rows
of fat were sufficient for the frizzling, and the hard,
horny hide served the purpose of a pan. The pore,
was merely covered with glowing coals and roasted in
his juice.
* * * *
“D.F.”: The pearly nautilus is a very rare
shell in Tasmanian waters, and when it comes ashore
it is, as a rule, battered or broken. But there’s a
little half-mile beach at Lagoon Bay (Wilmot Harbor
on the maps), on the east coast of Forestier Penin-
sula, which makes a specialty of these shells. More
seem to > come up there than on all the other much
bigger beaches put together. And they are generally
in good condition.
* * * *
“Shepherd”: A while ago a’ previously
unknown tribe of Binghis visited the Violet Valley
abo. station (W.A.). The local abos. called them
“saltwater blacks.” They wore no clothes, not even
a loin-cloth, and could not understand English. It
is remarkable how these little congregations have
managed to exist without discovery. Only a ; few
years ago a tribe was discovered in the mallee-and-
spinifex country near the sou’-west corner of N. S.
Wales, though that territory was occupied long
before Burke and Wills passed through.
“Jackdaw”: Here’s the last supper for
sheep-worrying dogs. Shoot a wallaby. Cut him
through to the backbone. Drag the mess over your
tracks for one mile to the haunt of the thief. Steep
your boots in the mix-up. Strip wally. Stand on
his shirt. Hang the carcase to a tree by putting
one hind-leg through the hamstring of the other
around a limb just out of easy reach of Mephisto-
plieles. Cut out and poison the pluck. Drop it
under the decoy. Cover slightly with rubbish, using
a stick. Walk away, trailing the skin behind. 1
know of a £2O and have heard of a £5O bonus
earned this way.
* * * *
“C.C.P.”: “Machete” (B. 31/1/T8) is
quite right in believing that cannibalism was pretty
common in South Queensland. The greatest author-
ity on the local blacks, the late Tom Petrie, told me
that though the natives never killed their kind for
food, they most certainly never failed to eat anyone
killed in fight, and always ate a “turrwan” (great
man), no matter how old he was or what was the
cause of death. They had some strange ideas about
the body of a great man. They explained that they
ate it out of pity and consideration; that “they
knew where he was then” and “he won’t stink.” As
for the old tough gins, no one troubled to eat them;
their bodies weren't of any importance and had no
pity shown them. On the other hand, a young,
plump gin would always be eaten; likewise anyone
dying in good condition. As to the bunya feasts, it
was once stated by an early-day casual observer that
the blacks grew so tired of nut and vegetable food
during this period that to satisfy the craving that
grew upon them for animal food they terminated the
meeting by the sacrifice of one gin or more. This
was quite untrue. On their way to and from these
great gatherings the natives travelled along the
coast as much as was possible, and got fish and
oysters; also while there they hunted for ’possums,
carpet-snakes, eggs, etc. They, however, grew quite
fat on the nut diet. After the corroborees and cere-
monies were over a fight always ended proceedings,
and someone was sure to be killed. Then all parted
the best of friends. People speak of the great num-
ber killed in fight, but the truth is that the dead
were but few, though wounds were plentiful enough.
Singeing and skinning and dividing a corpse prepara-
tory to a feast was quite a ceremony.
“Te Whare”: In 1837 the New Zealand
Land Association published a report of its doings, in-
cluding, inter alia, an interesting account of the
trade in tattooed Maori heads. According to the
document this traffic was very profitable. The skulls
were sold in Sydney as curios. Finally, one ship’s
captain brought to market 10 heads of chiefs. That
settled it. While the grisly relics were being offered
for sale old parson Sam Marsden obtained an order
from Governor Darling declaring the practice un-
lawful ; and so a flourishing little industry was
summarily squelched.

that a soft tough rubber

HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS
= CURE =
IS THE FINEST REMEDY IN THE WORLD FOR
COUGHS, CROUP AND COLDS.
THOSE who have had occasion to take Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure are
astonished at its Wonderful healing Power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Pain or Soreness in the (
Chest, Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Stuffiness,
Asthma, experience delightful and rapid relief. This
medicine is particularly valuable to those who are sub-
ject to Colds on the Chest, as it Strengthens the Lungs,
and renders them less susceptible. It is most comfort-
ing in allaying Irritation in the Throat, and giving
Strength to the Voice, and for this reason is thoroughly
appreciated by Clergymen, Public Speakers and
Singers. It does not allow a Cough to become
Chronic, and in this respect is absolutely indis-
pensable in preventing a cold from developing
into Bronchitis, Asthma, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,
or Consumption. No house should be with-
out a bottle of this Wonderful Remedy, as
taken at the first indication of a Cold, a
dose or two is generally sufficient. A
Cold should always be “nipped in the
bud,” or serious illness may follow.

“Cross-Cut”: “Myola” made one mistake
(B. 14/2/’18) in describing the La Perouse
(Sydney) porpoise industry. “Acres of
hides,” he said, “are thrown away to feed
the sharks. We prefer to import our bootlaces
and other porpoise-leather goods from the
North Sea via Europe.” It’s a very old
fallacy about the waterproof qualities of
porpoise skin. The so-called “porpoise-liide”
is simply a trade name for a good-quality
close-grained horse or similar leather, very
suitable for shooting-boots used in wet coun-
try. It has a reputation for being waterproof,
gained principally by the trade name “por-
poise.” The skin of the real thing is quite
worthless. If “Myola” can show the tan-
ners how to make any kind of leather from
porpoise, shark or even whale covering, he’ll
soon lind the fishermen bothering to take the
weighty objects to Sydney. By the way, did
"Myola” ever try to skin a porpoise?
“Squills”: M.L. is beginning to turn its
hydro-electric power to good uses besides
driving street cars, lighting the cities and
running factories. Some chemicals, which
since the war have swooped up to prohibi-
tive prices, are likely to be brought down to
normal or thereabouts by the development
of the Lake Coleridge (Canterbury) power.
Sulphate of iron, formerly imported for
purifying gas, has been replaced in Canter-
bury by hydrate of iron, obtained from old
tins. Caustic soda (it cost £l2 per ton
before the war and now costs £45) is about
to be manufactured in Christchurch by the
electrolysis of' common salt; same with
hydrochloric acid. Also, preliminary work
is being done on the direct electrolysis . of
water, to yield oxygen for acetylene welding
and hydrogen for the hardening of fats.
Birks, the expert in charge of the Coleridge
scheme, reckons that hydro-electric power
will enable the Shaky Islands to evaporate
enougti sea-water to produce all the common
salt the inhabitants want, at a very low cost.
For another thing, the water-power will
enable M.L. lo manufacture all the calcium
carbide it needs, all the ammonia, and all the
explosives required to strafe an invader. So
far only the Canterbury alpine lake is har-
nessed, but there is a vastly greater volume
of power waiting for the turbines in the
Waikato River and Lake Waikaremoana.
During the last Melbourne heat-wave two
workmen tapped an lSgal. keg of beer at
Flinders-street station. On' the Beak saying
it would cost them £lO apiece, one of the
beer-suckers complained bitterly that when
his turn had come at the bamboo it wouldn’t
reach to the beer, and he got none. But Jus-
tice wouldn’t even knock off the price of a
pint.
“Bluegum”: The old-time Maori had a
measuring-rod, called a rauru, on which the
owner’s arm-span and other measurements
were marked. But each brown man
was generally his own yard-measure. When
Timi wanted to find out the length of a ship
or a whale or a palisade he would lie down
at full length alongside the object, with his
arm stretched out, make a mark, then get up
and keep going till he had finished his reckon-
ing. Naturally there was room for argu-
ment with a tomahawk when a-bantam and
a six-foot-three cannibal compared notes with
regard to, say, Timi’s new war-canoe.
“Try Fluke’’: No need to import Irish or
other moss into Maoriland when the sea-
shore rocks for hundreds of miles are thickly
coated with exactly the substance that strafes
bronchitis, sore throat and kindred troubles.
The vegetable is called by the Maoris
karengo, and it is a palatable and nourish-
ing addition to pork and spuds. The natives
scrape it off the rocks at half-tide, squeeze
it into small lumps, and dry. it in
the sun as a preliminary to the
pot. I am told that there is practically
no difference in essentials between this
karengo and the carageen moss which is
gathered on the Irish coasts. A curious
point also is that Pat O’Flaherty’s and Hone
te Kooti’s names for the stuff should so
closely resemble each other. Here’s a bur-
row opened for the comparative philologist
to go nosing into.
* * * *
“Silas Snell’’: Not so long ago I struck
a far-east Gippsland family of five, all
grown up, not one of whom had seen a rail-
way train, so I can believe Tomlofty’s story.
Tomlofty is one of the many travelling re-
presentatives of a familiar sewing-machine
co. Late last year he conceived the
idea of taking a sample machine on the
razor-edge of a mule, and penetrating to
recesses into which no sewing-machine agent
had ever yet insinuated himself. It was in
the course of these explorations that he dis-
covered the McCances. He talked with
McCance about his miraculous machine, and
McCance was interested. “I’ve heard tell of
’em,” he said. Tomlofty said no family
could afford to be without the implement.
“What figger?” asked McCance. “Ten
quid.” said Tomlofty, chancing it. “Ten
quid?” drawled McCance. “Bring ’er along,
V let’s have a look at ’er.” Tomlofty un-
strapped his sample, and carried it into
McCanee’s kitchen. The sale he reckoned a
dead cert. McCance looked the apparatus
over. “Yes,” he said, “she looks pretty, ’n’
she seems all right, ’n’ I’d like to have her;
but blow me if I can see how you're goin'
to put in a crop with a machine like that!”

“Birregurra”: Melbourne firms have evi-
dently spotted a new method of dodging war-
time profits tax. An epidemic of premises-
renovation has set in round the city, which
reeks of paint and varnish. The other day
I counted 10 newly-decorated buildings in
one block.
“Suwarrow” : Outside the premises of the
Commonwealth Bank at Melbourne there is
a large sign urging Australians to be patri-
otic and pour their good Australian cash
into the War Loan. All the timber of the
framework to carry this appeal to be patriotic
is—imported Oregon !
* * * •*
“Wong” : The Primary Industries Develop-
ment League is a better infant than “Henry
Horsecollar” (B. 21/2/’18) thus far thinks
it is. It is joyously and frankly an organisa-
tion to boost, and has no time or room for
the stinking-fish whiners who have done more
to retard Australia’s progress than anything
else. Taking a leaf out of America’s book
of success, it aims at advertising and boost-
ing different country districts that have
sufficient self-confidence to put up some of
the expense of making Australia seem a
desirable place in the eyes of war-weary
white people overseas, our own and other
countries’ Billjims, and their like. And
it hopes to set the Government red-tape
bureaux an example by having a definite
proposition to put up to these newcomers,
and not allow them to wander around Sydney
spending all their oof before they know
where they are. Anyone who knows any-
thing of our immigration and land-settlement
methods of the last 10 years would not deem
a business-like organisation preparing to
tackle the job, openly and aboveboard, an
“unaccountable.” If “Henry Horsecollar,”
good Australian as we know him to
be, would wander round to the at present,
modest office of the League, 16 O’Connell-
street, Sydtiey, and put the acid on the scheme
I reckon he would withdraw the epithet.
* * * *
“Mirrool” : Ordinary coal-gas now pushes
almost all large cars and commercial lorries
in England, where severe restrictions are put
on the use of petrol. It certainly doesn’t
add to the beauty of the car. A platform is
built over the body, and on it is mounted a
cylindrical container. Gas cos. have estab-
lished refilling points along the main roads,
and the gas is sold at a rate which gives
cheaper haulage that petrol ever did. Inci-
dentally, the small boy finds great joy in
puncturing the gas-bag with barbed darts. It
is ever so much more sudden fun than push-
ing a pin into an inflated tyre.

A waggon piled with furniture was trailing
through Sydney one day lately, when some-
body stopped the driver and asked him where
he was taking the bushfire. The astonished
charioteer looked behind, saw swirling clouds
of smoke and fell off. Then a load of firemen
clattered round the corner and doused the
blazing caravan ; after which insurance man-
agers had another interesting item for their
Book of Instructions to Canvassers.
The magistrate of Tower Bridge, London,
has been fhaking known his theory, formed
from long experience, that the honesty of a
crowd depends on the time of day. “It is
not a question of drink at all; a subtle
change se|ms to come over the character of
people with the later hours.” If he hap-
pened to drop 10 sovereigns in a crowded
street any time before midday, he would
expect to get back about eight of them, and
at the later hours a steadily decreasing
number, till at midnight he would be lucky
t-' recover two. It sounds ingenious, but
if you went to the right place you could
get your pocket picked just as easily at 10
a.in. as at midnight. The character of the
crowd in the street changes mostly because
the crowd changes.
* * * *
“Quidam”: The country resident, particu-
larly the non-travelled variety, possesses
weird ideas regarding prevailing high prices,
his settled conviction being that they are the
fault of the local storekeeper. As a matter
of fact, no one is more injured by the pre-
sent prices than small country tradesmen.
Whatever the profiteering, and whoever is
doing it, they are not benefiting by it, for
they are frequently unable, by reason of the
poverty and crass ignorance of their clients,
to pass on as much of the increased prices
as they are entitled to. A long-established
country blacksmith I know does his own
work and has enough to keep him pretty
busy, too. Most of his customers accuse him
of exorbitant prices, and allege that he is
coining money; yet for a month’s steady toil
of himself and his 18-year-old son his' tak-
ings were £2B, out of which £l4-odd went
for material, so that the wages of the two
workers barely amounted to £3 10s. a week,
with upkeep of shop, tools, etc., to come
out of it. Yet he recognises that it is im-
possible to raise his prices further, as the
local people couldn’t or wouldn’t stand it.
Undue profits would be snipped off sooner if
people stopped blaming the -wrong man and
started looking for the right one. To culti-
vate the idea that one of their own fellow-
villagers, whom they have known for years
and always found a decent chap, has sud-
denly developed furious rapacity, is a silly
sort of business that diverts attention from
much larger persons who are making much
more indecent profits.

“Baro”: “Bill Bowyang” (28/2/T8) is
on the right track when lie repeats a two-
year-old call of The Bulletin and urges
the Defence Department or the Mitchell
Library to collect the journals published on
hospital ships and transports. Of late they
have been mostly printed in Durban or Cape
Town while the ship coaled. The Cape
Times office has laid itself out to produce
“rush” editions. We took our copy for a
10-pager to the printer at 2 p.m. on Friday,
and got the thousand copies with illustra-
tions at 10 next morning. There are over
100 different productions on file in the office.
The Cape Public Library is collecting them
all. and I am sure a request from the autho-
rities here would bring a copy of everything
issued .to date. On ships having printing
plant on board Billjim journalism has also
flourished. On a White Star liner, for in-
stance, Transport Jottings contained the

Judges often have to discuss the differ-

says both, various printed copies differing

the original signed copy of the Act has dis-
appeared ; possibly it may be in London at
the Colonial Office. So nobody can say
whether the Law reo.uires both “consent and
order,” in certain cases, or if either “consent
or order” is sufficient.
“S.T.S.”: It is pleasant to find, in
Hardy’s last book of verse, an Australian
turn of speech, “that cow Oblivion”- —and a
fair cow some ambitious people have found
it. P.S. —On a second look this cow turns
out to be a verb. The idea is that there are
in Shakspeare “harmonies that cow Obli-
vion,” whatever that may mean.

The Christmas literary supplement of
London Times has a complaint to make
about the lady storytellers of Australia and
Maoriland. They “barely touch upon the
fringe of the many experiences a vivid
description of which would be both new and
helpful and vastly entertaining to girls of
this country.” Isabel Maud Peacocke’s
Maoriland yarn, “Patricia Pat,” and Mary
Grant Bruce’s Victorian bush-farm story,
“Possum,” are the text of these remarks.
Still, Possum is an example of “courage and
unselfishness in simple conditions which it
is quite worth while for English girls to
know.” The Times complaint has a lot of
justification. But why confine it to the
women? One of TriE Bulletin’s major
tribulations is that, while it is hungry for
the local color of places further afield than
the outer suburbs, the man or woman who
lives in Central Papua, or on a northern
canefield, or in a far-west boundary-rider’s
hut, will persist in writing stuff that'the city
literary tradesman can turn out just as well
in his factory. On the whole, in fact, this
paper’s experience is that men are more
prone to do this than women.
Jack _Maher, a well-known sporting writer,
is assisting Ballarat pressman Monty
McCallum in the compilation of “Victoria’s
Who’s Who.” dealing with deeds and mis-
deeds of public men, sportsmen and others.
McCallum recently published a special edi-
tion in Ballarat and appreciably improved
his banking account.

From Pearson’s :
Possibly you’ve heard of the Sydney Bulletin.
Those interesting young men in slouch hats orna-
mented with rising suns are fond of mentioning it.
It is, of course, the one and only paper worth pub-
lishing and readin-'-- that is their universal opinion.
But there is an exception and the other dav we met
him. “Believe me, dinkum,” he said earnestly, “there
are not three men on The Bulletin to-day who
could write ‘Hamlet’!”
Oh, well, neither could Shakspeare.
* * * *
“II.H.”: That man up Narromine way
who took fire with fatal results while sleep-
ing behind Dobbin in lus cart was remark-
able,. but a stranger occurrence once nearly
got into print in a provincial paper. It was
a pity that the editor found out in time to
kill it. A dissipated reporter was doing
“accidents and offences,” and the general but
hazy effect of his best effort seemed to imply
that the carburetter blew up, and in conse-
quence the horse bolted and Mrs. Smith,
being thrown out against a tree, died of
ptomaine poisoning. This attempt to con-
dense three happenings into one wasn’t
approved, and there was an aching void on
the staff that night.

Ambrose Pratt has taken hold of the
Mining Standard. Critchley Parker’s
humorous fad of calling it also the States-
man has been dropped ; it is now the Indus-
trial and Mining Standard, and promises
to be a sane and vigorous fighter for the
development, as distinguished from the ex-
ploitation, of Australia.


“AtAMAX"
• - 7 -i- t : .
Asphaltum Roofing
has been tried and tested in this country
under every conceivable condition, on every
class of building.
It has successfully met the most exacting
roofing demands —that is proved by its use
in these big contracts.
“Adamax” Outbid All Competitors
in These Jobs.
Murrumbidgee Irrigation Commission —Lee-
ton Canning Factories, 20,000 sq. yds.
Messrs. Tipton & Co., Ltd., Factory, Alex-
andria, Sydney.
South Australian Wheat Board Buildings,
42,000 sq. yds.
W.A. Government Freezing Works at Wynd-
liam, 13,200 sq. yds.
The Public Works Dept, has “Adamax” on
its approved list; contracts to the N.S.W.
Railways for 1917-18 were secured by
“Adamax.” There are many other instances
of this almost universal preference.
Needless to say, the most exhaustive tests
were conducted before “Adamax” was
accepted for these contracts.
“Adamax” Costs One=tHird
the Price of Galvanised Iron
Railage charges are also reduced one-third.
“Adamax”. will not Rust, Rot nor Pinhole.
Neither will it sweat. It needs no preservative
naint. “Adamax” reduces the temperature of
houses 12 to 14 degrees in Summer. There are
many other superior features of Vital Interest.

"KLARO”
The Water Clarifier
. “Klaro” achieves in a few hours, and at
trifling expense, what lias been almost
impossible heretofore—the clarifying and ■
purifying of water in Dams, Tanks, etc.
Conserved water, especially in country dis-
tricts, quickly becomes contaminated. To
drink such water exposes one to grave danger
from disease.
‘‘Klaro” Makes the
Water Supply Safe.
It is extremely simple'in use, yet absolutely
effective in all cases. The desired quantity
is simply thrown into the tank or dam and
then well stirred. In from one to two hours
all the sediment, mud or fine vegetable
matter will be precipitated to the bottom,
leaving the water crystal clear and pure.
“Klaro” is quite harmless and has no dele-
terious effect on the water whatever.
For stock or household water supplies
“Klaro” is indispensable.
All good storekeepers sell “Klaro” in lib.,
31b. and slb. boxes. If not stocked in your
town, post us 35/-, by cheque or postal note,
and we will forward a 151 b. case direct.
“Klaro” is supplied to storekeepers in one-
sized case only, containing 561 b., made up of
lib.. 31b. and 51b. boxes.
o
“ADAMAX”
Has also been
selected by the
N.S.W. Railways
for their require-
ments for 1918-
1919. This is fur-
ther proof of its

WATCHES at PRE-WAR PRICES
We have some hundreds of gentlemen’s
Silver and Metal Watches that we bought at
a large reduction from a firm closing their
business down.
These watches are all 3 Levers, with 15
jewels, and have compensated balances. In
short, they are really reliable timekeepers
and strong. So much so that we guarantee
them for 15 years, and keep them in order
without charge for two years, breakages
excepted.
Owing to the Italian and French railways
being congested with w'ar work, Swiss watches
have been held up on the Frontier for months
past, and some houses are profiteering in
consequence.
We are selling all the above-mentioned
watches at pre-war prices.

DESTROYING THE DANDRUFF
GERM.
HOW TO GROW THICK, GLOSSY
HAIR.
The large increase in hair troubles within
the last year has become alarming, so much
so that almost every other person, whether
aware of the fact or not, suffers from hair
trouble of some kind or other from time to
time. In many cases the trouble gradually
increases and becomes chronic. The result
is probably falling hair and premature
baldness. One of the commonest and most
deadly of hair troubles results from the
presence of the dandruff germ. A reliable
hair tonic that will destroy this germ is
absolutely essential, and should be used by
everyone noticing the slightest sign of
dandruff or scurf. Many different prepara-
tions have been tried from time to time, but
the formula which is said to produce the
best results is the following: 3oz. bay rum.
loz. lavona de composee, and J-drachm men-
thol crystals. These ingredients can be
obtained from the chemist and easily mixed
at home, and if the tonic is well rubbed into
the scalp night and morning it will quickly
eradicate every trace of scurf and dandruff.
It will also allay irritation, stop hair falling
out, and make dull, thin, straggly hair grow
thick, long and lustrous once more.—Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
As soon as Billjim, returned invalided, gets
his ticket lie passes into the presence of the
Pensions Magistrate to do one of the most
important bits of business of his life. As a
rule, he doesn’t know much about business—
is hazy about the regulations and his rights;
and even if he wasn’t hazy, nine times out of
ten he wouldn’t know how to make out his
case. Further, his training in the army has
unfitted him for arguing with “superior
authority.” He takes what is given him —
and growls about it afterwards. And un-
fortunately he mostly does his growling
among possible recruits, which isn’t good for
recruiting. Three years ago the lawyers of
some parts of Australia did fine work for
Billjim—and for recruiting—by establishing
Red Cross Information Bureaus. They can
DINNER-TIME.
THE CHEF: "Well, no, I haven't exactly
cooked anything yet, but I am compiling
an excellent cookery-book.”
do better work for Billjim and recruiting
now by undertaking to see him through the
Pensions Court. And they ought to'lose no
time in setting up in every capital an agency
for the purpose.
“Senator Pearce- Stands Firm” was a
heading in a last week’s daily. It should
have been “Senator Pearce Wobbles All Over
the Place,” or “Senator Pearce Totters On
Both Feet.” The subject was the trouble at
Lithgow where the four barrel-straighteners
(a small group of highly-paid specialists
whose habit of sending an ultimatum to the
management is chronic) went on strike.
Australia’s very essential war industry was
paralysed, and 1100 men thrown out of work.
The grievance is alleged to be that the barrel-
straighteners objected to official military in-
spection of their output. In the interests of
Australia and the empire and of the civilisa-
tion which the Ilun is wrecking, it was
Pearce’s business to squash that strike with
the utmost rigor of the War Precautions
Act and to promptly redress the grievances,
if any, afterwards. Instead he only Stood
Firm with his Mouth. lie stood just like
Postmaster-General Webster’s lost letter-
bags, which ought to be travelling to their
destination, but aren’t.
A conference of unions is to meet shortly
and grieve ovsr the high cost of living. One
reason is the multiplicity of strikes, almost
all illegal and many of them trivial and
purposeless. In 1916 (latest complete
figures) the Common wealth lost 1,678,930
days’ work, worth £967,604 in wages. That
means, in the end, £967,604 added to the
scarcity of things and consequently to the
aggregate cost of things. Incidentally
£674,064 of the loss and scarcity and in-
creased cost was in N. S. Wales alone.
W. M. Hughes holds one record which is
likely to be good for a long time. He has
led four consecutive Ministries. The day
he retired he came back, so Hughes (going-
out three times) bumped against Hughes
(coming in) on the doorstep. Henry Ayers,
of S. Australia, who was his own successor
in two pairs of Governments, is next best.
“Canuck”: It is soothing to reflect that if
the Federal Government isn’t Winning the
War it is at least considering some people’s
interests. While the Victorian housewife is
so hampered by the alleged shortage of
sugar that she has had to abandon her
annual jam-making outburst, the breweries
have somehow contrived to obtain full sup-
plies. It is likewise pleasing to note that
owing to tons of good fruit being thus wasted
the pigs are having a birthday. We are at
least fattening our own hogs.
There are men called William who look
so important that one hardly dreams of call-
ing them Bill in a friendly way, but this
paper is going to call William Irvine Bill
for a change. Lately
Bill suggested that the
Government should ig-
nore the Referendum
just as Hughes ignored
his promise to retire.
It should, said Bill,
introduce a compul-
sory-service proposi-
tion and stand or fall
by the issue. There-
upon Sydney Tele-
graph spoke to Bill
and asked if, after such
treachery, the promise
of any politician
would be believed.
But politicians get on
pretty well without
being believed. For
instance, the Holman
crowd attained office
in N. S. Wales on a
promise to reduce loan
expenditure (whi c h
was a little over
£1,000,000 in the year
when the promise was
made) and to spend
loan money only on
works which would
pay full interest and
sinking fund. The
loans were rushed up
to £9,000,000 in the
worst year, and the
interest and sinking
fund idea went to the
bosom of Jonah. Yet
though the solemn
promise of Holman
and Co. on a big finan-
cial question was re-
pudiated, the public
not only keeps them
in office but accepts
the signature of the
repudiating crowd on millions and millions
worth (face value) of bonds, and even the
Telegraph hardly complains. So why
should Bill (any Bill) be more righteous
than his neighbors?
Hughes at a British Empire League’s
luncheon in Sydney :
How many votes would a man get who stood on the
hustings and expressed himself in favor of German
goods, or any other goods, coming into Australia free
for the next 10 years?
But why should a man be such a clumsy
fool? It is far more profitable for him to
talk magnificently about patriotism and
winning wars and so on while he’s letting
the sliprail down for the foreigner.
The change of Government in Victoria
has given one or two progressive minds a
chance to shake up the skeletons in
the State cupboard. One of the
loudest rattles has been caused by
Treasurer McPherson investigating
the Compassionate Allowance Fund
established in one of his mellow
moments by the late T. Bent.
McPherson has found it to be “prac-
tically a secret pension fund”; in
one instance, £1 a week was being
paid to an ex-Government servant
with two married sons, one with a
screw of £750 and allowing the old
man ss. out of his weekly £l4. The
Treasurer is going to abolish the
fund, if he can, and leave the State-
aided “benevolent” societies to do the
necessary compassioning. It seems a t
painful alternative, yet the Govern-’
ment can’t go on showering private
blessings around while it can only
meet its public obligations by tap-
ping the pawnshop.
In spite of the official decree that
wooden ships are of no use to Aus-
tralia unless they are built in the
U.S.A., Tasmanian shipbuilders per-
sist in turning the things out. Not
satisfied with the 400-ton schooner
already under way, Hobart ship-
builders are laying down a 000-ton wooden
sailing vessel, and they will build it, too,
unless the Pliewsion Government stops them
—as it stopped the Broken Hill Prop, when
it wanted to build steel ships. The biggest
vessel turned out in Tasmania in the old
days was 562 tons register.
PEACE ARRIVES: 19 ?
Just when it was definitely understood
that the Federal Government should build
ships at Walsh Island (N.S.W.) instead of
the State Government, as originally pro-
posed, it was suggested that the State Gov-
ernment should build ships at Walsh Island
(N.S.W.) instead of the Federal Govern-
ment as proposed after the previous proposal.
Whereupon Mr. Watt in Victoria discussed
the matter with Mr. Hughes in Victoria and
telegraphed to Mr. Holman in N. S. Wales
asking him to come to Melbourne in Victoria
and thresh the matter out. And now the
Lord only knows what will happen next.
This subject has all the dodgy capacity of a
Hea.
If Pearce has a Commission straying
about he might ask it to call in at Adelaide
and investigate the workings not only of the
Defence Department there but also of the
agencies set up for the assistance of returned
Billjim. There is, for instance, a Provi-
dent Soldiers’ Fund which is really an Im-
provident Soldiers’ Fund, and its operations
have the effect of confirming them in their
improvidence. One result is that it is
becoming more and more difficult for re-
turned men to get employment in S. Aus.;
and as that is most prejudicial to recruiting,
there is very good reason why the suggested
Commission should poke an inquisitive nose
into the matter.
The ancient judge slumbering on the
bench with one deaf ear in the grave is a
scandal, and N. S. Wales proposes to retire
his Honor (with a liberal pension) at the
age of 70. A protest was entered by two
legal members, who said that the measure
should only apply to “future” judges,
“present” judges not having bargained for
compulsory retirement on an age limit. They
talked largely about “keeping faith.” But
never a word did they say about keeping
faith with the litigant who didn’t bargain for
losing his case and a heap of money simply
because he was supplied (having no voice
in the matter) with a learned ruin who
hardly knew whether he was a plaintiff or
a hardened offender.
THE PIPE OF PEACE.
Chief Justice Griffith has been given a
Commission to find out how many reinforce-
ments are wanted. Well, and suppose he
does find out? In August, 1915, nearly
three years ago, Griffith’s colleague Rich
was given a Commission to find out how
things might be improved in the administra-
tion of the Defence Department. He
reported :— ■
In this war between nations the time is fully ripe
for organising the services of all classes of the com-
munity. Business men might well be employed in
matters where their training and experience would
be of the greatest advantage to the military authori-
ties, e.g., in connection with ordnance and on finance
committees.
After a few millions had been wasted, Justice
Rich’s recommendation was more or less
adopted in February , 1918. There really
seems to be room for only one more Commis-
sion. The German camps might be asked
to suggest the personnel, and its job would
be to tell the Ministers whether, in the
Commission’s opinion, they have left undone
anything that might help the Kaiser.
The loudest squeal over the Federal Gov-
ernment’s price-fixing of meat was that of
Edmund Jowett, M.P. According to this
excited but vague meat —er —consumer the
“proposal to reduce the prices of Australian
meat for local consumption to the prices
fixed for export would prejudicially affect
the people, not only of Australia, but of the
whole empire. It would mean a loss of
£45,000,000 to the stockholders of Aus-
tralia.” But why not turn it upside down
and say that it will mean a gain of
£45,000,000 to the people of Australia?
Meantime what are Jowett’s brethren going
to do to him for being so frank about the
size of the attempted steal?
LIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The cable is the most ingenious system of lying
ever invented.”—lf. M. lluglics.
It lies, it lies! The trembling word that quivers
About the world beneath the pulsing sea.
To think of how it lies gives me the shivers.
It lies, it lies —and, worse, it lies of me!
fn all the lands and over all creation
My venomed enemies forever lurk,
The vantage ground of every cable station
Affords their malice room for evil work.
Naught I can do, naught I can say protects me.
Some twisted shame their thoughts must still
devise.
The very city that with pride elects me
Ts fed forever with their cabled lies.
What’s that? The censorship is mine to handle!
Great is the glory of the pencil’s blue !
It is the light, the torch, the glowing candle
To win-the-war and lead the people through 1
Hut still those lies are always in the cable
That quivers underneath the pulsing sea ;
And not the boldest censor’s fist is able
To camouflage the words that speak of me.
Ties and more lies! But keep the old flag waving!
We yet may get a grip upon the news;
And by suppressing all may come near saving
The splendid name and high repute of Hughes!

COMSTOCK’S “DEAD-SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE SPECIFIC FOR
THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN CHILDREN
AND ADULTS.
The general symptoms of worms are a
tendency to pick the nose and a sensation of
itching in the anus. Other symptoms are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, and grind-
ing the teeth, sudden starting out of sleep as
if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the, eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children, and symptoms resembling
water in the head have been ascribed to
worms, and have ceased on their expulsion.
The long round or stomach worm is the
commonest kind of worm from which man-
kind suffers, and is of a light, transparent
color, resembling the ordinary ground worm,
except that the extremities are more sharply
pointed than the ground worm.
Young people are more subject to these
worms than middle-aged or elderly people.
They live in the bowels, and sometimes make
their way into the stomach and throat, caus-
ing sickness, vomiting and choking. Gener-
ally one or two would be the most a person
would be afflicted with, but sometimes a
much larger number is met with. The length
varies from four to eight inches, but young
ones an inch to two inches long are also
found. The first thing to do is to rid the
system of the worms, and Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according to
directions, are an effective remedy for the
thorough eradication of the long round or
stomach worm —the common enemy of the
child, the youth, the middle-aged and aged.
A light, nourishing diet, out-of-door exercise,
and, if possible, a change of air will greatly
improve the general health.
*
Threadworms or pinworms are of very
common occurrence in children. They are
very small, from one-sixth of an inch to half-
an-inch in length, and resemble cotton
thread—they are sometimes called seat
worms, and reside in the lower bowel. The
chief symptom of this worm is severe local
itching, restlessness and irritability, and a
frequent desire to urinate, picking at the
nose; loss of appetite and anaemia are also
observed. To get rid of the worms and their
eggs their nests also must be removed, and
that requires a specific remedy. Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according
to directions, on an empty stomach, followed
by a dose of opening medicine, will succeed
where others fail.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are packed with full directions, and
are for sale by chemists and stores
generally at 3s. 6d. per packet, or six
packets for 205., and if unable to obtain
locally will be mailed post free on receipt of
price. Prepared only by The W. H. Comstock

AN AUSTRALIAN PRODUCT.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS have been manufactured entirely in Australia
for the past fifteen years, and it is safe to say that nowhere in any country is a better pill
made, both as regards high-grade ingredients, splendid efficiency’and general appearance. They
are packed in the well-known Amber Bottle, not in cheap wooden or cardboard boxes, and there-
fore are unaffected by climatic changes and reach the public in perfect condition. It may be stated,
also, the ownership of this preparation is all British. It is not for these reasons the merits of
Dr. Morse’s lndie.il Root Pills are urged on the attention of the public (although good
in themselves), but rather for the reason that they are a high-grade preparation, effective for all
classes of the community, both rich and poor. A millionaire can get nothing better at any price
to aid in the digestion and assimilation of his food. They cleanse the system, purify the blood,
and are a safe, certain and reliable remedy for all complaints arising from over-eating or over-drink-
ing, or from any other cause that has dislocated the digestive machine. They are sold at a price
within the reach of all.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Australian Cup race was a one-horse
affair for about 1} miles, Prince Bardolph being the
lone quadruped. Then it seemed almost a sure thing
that Defence would catch and pass the leader;
finally, when Defence had fulfilled expectations after
passing the distance post, Star Comedian came with
a bit of a rattle and ran Defence to a neck. Bar-
cjolph was only a length behind the second horse, so
lie may be said to have battled it out as bravely as
the two lighter-weighted ones. Fifteen other horses
never gave their backers a suspicion of a thrill.
Wallace Isinglass figured as chief offender. He was
.last when the field passed the judge’s box first time
/round, and not much better at the finish. In such
moderate company the vaunted son of Wallace ought
to have made a show at some point of the race, but
somehow he ran like a duffer all the time. His drop
back in the betting before the start was only a sug-
gestion of what was going to happen in the race.
The lather heavy going made the long - , long Cup
procession a very genuine test of stamina, and the
victory of Defence pleased most people who didn’t
back the second or third. The crowd remarked that
the old imported animal had been run without any
idea of bringing off a surprise. He earned a 71b.
penalty a month or more ago, and won another event
on the Saturday previous to this best race of his
life.
Star Comedian’s second in the Australian
Cup was a rather odd coincidence. The runner-up
in the preceding race was Tragic Star.
* * * *
Defence was not the only imported nag 1 to
make the most of a light weight in heavy going
at the late V.R.C. meeting. Blackwood won the
Autumn Handicap on Saturday like an honest old
stayer. It wasn’t much of a triumph for English
horseflesh, considering that Bronzetti was trying to
give the aged gelding 121 b. ; but taken in conjunc-
tion with Defence’s running over long distances it
went to prove that the average imported horse is
comparatively better as a stayer than as a sprinter.
Of late years the fastest of the imported ones have
been absurdly uncertain. They never sprint twice
alike.
* * * *
An interesting item of the postponed Aus-
tralian Cup Day racing at Flemington was the re-
vival of Tinto, an old chestnut timber-topper. Tinto
hadn’t won a race for four long years, and was
down to 9st. 31b., or nearly the lowest mark in the
weights. The has-been was whispered to be in some-
thing like his best form, but punters remained
sceptical, all the same. Perhaps the heavy going
favored the ancient. Anyhow, he won in quite
commanding style. Nor was he favored by luck.
People say of steeplechasers that they are “bound
to win if they stand up.” In this case all 11
starters stood up.
* * * *
Cetigne emphasised his quality by winning
the mile w.f.a. at Flemington last Saturday, beat-
ing Whiteficld, Wedge and the apparently unripe
Panacre. This time he was meeting Wedge on 81b.
worse terms than in the Newmarket, but the luck-
less Wedge had probably gone off a trifle since he
won the Futurity, whereas Cetigne was still at his
top. Later in the afternoon Desert Gold ran away
with the Governor's Plate in champion style, doing
the 12 furlongs in 2min. 35Jsec. On paper it was
picking up money to lay seven to four on the Maori-
land mare in a field of four, but the aroma of his
Spring reputation clung to imported Lanius and
brought him many backers. Lanius failed badly at
the finish, so it really looks as though the great
November disappointment might as well be retired
from public life and put to matrimony. He is a
noble-looking animal, and his record indicates that
he should get stayers if he is promptly sent to the
stud.
# * * *
The Maorilander was beaten again on
Monday at Flemington, this time by Wallace Ising-
glass at w.f.a ; and if this does not send the fickle
chestnut out a loaring favorite for the Sydney Cup,
then there is no such thing as certainty in the wide
world. There were only three starters in the King’s
Plate —Desert Gold, Wallace and the tender-footed
Lingle—and the race turned into a match from the
turn into the straight between the mare and the other.
As usual, Desert Gold ran away with the lead, and at
one stage had a break of half a dozen lengths. Four
furlongs from home Wallace closed on her, and they
larded into the fairway together. Both were ridden
to the distance, and there the mare began to falter.
She was clean out, and Wallace ran in a winner by
a length and a half, Lingle a long way astern.
Whereupon an opulent colliery proprietor was so
full of joy that he was detected trying to grin.
# * * *
The once-boomed Sir Amyas gave unmis-
takable evidence of what’s the matter with him
by his in-and-out running at the V.R.C. meeting.
On the first Saturday he appeared to be home and
dry for the Brunswick Stakes when he led the field
into the straight. But it wasn’t his day for strug-
gling, or perhaps the mud worried him. A couple
of hundred yards from home he began to stick
his toes into the mud, and he -finished fourth
instead of first. A week later, on the same course,
the imported cocktail carried a stone more, and
won generously (from a weaker field) in ssec. faster
time. Sir Amyas may be nothing to write home
about, but he is at least a horse.
“0.K.”: Rather late in the day it has
become obvious to all Flemington racegoers that,
save in the dryest weather, the outside of the straight,
nearest to the judge s box, must necessarily be better
going than the inside, where a mob of horses is
being jostled in the ordinary way of racing for posi-
tions near to the rails. As regards sprints down the
6-furlong straight, the public always had a suspicion
that the outside horses had a pull over the crowd
that followed the beaten track. 'The Maribyrnong
Plate, for instance, was frequently won of old by a
youngster that ran on the outside all the way. The
Newmarket Handicap of recent years has rarely fallen
to one of the inside-railers. But the exact reason
why the outside division had an advantage in sprint
races was not generally considered. The public,
being used to noting the fact that horses on the
inside of the circus track had less ground to cover
than the outsiders in long-distance events, or in
sprints with only one turn in them, overlooked the
fact that the shortest way round was also the softest
way home, except in very dry weather. The course
may be levelled and rolled and rolled and levelled
after a day’s racing, but the side that suffers the
more kicking about must always be the side that is
comparatively softened by repairs. It is doubtful
whether, in wet weather, a horse gains an advantage
by saving ground at the turns.
Of late years very little had been heard of
little Tommy Sanders, who won a Melbourne Cup on
Dunlop in the distant past. He came into the lime-
light again at Flemington last Thursday. Dunwil,
an unknown 2-year-old colt trained by him, won
the first and last races on the programme. A clever
coup. The youngster won both events easily.

Next to having a nag that drops into the
soup when it has the cash aboard, the most exasperat-
ing thing that can happen to an owner is to have one
which arrives in a hurry and snatches the stake when
he thought something else was going to do it. This
happened two or three times at Rosehill on Saturday.
The imported Snow King was one of the culprits.
His performances generally have been as cheerful as
a recruiting scheme; and when he went out for the
Flying on Saturday among a fairly slick lot, the fact
that he ran nowhere in slower company a fortnight
before made him an unmarketable commodity. It
was something the same with Dame Acre in the
Rydalmere Mile, the supposition in this case being
that the journey was too far. But they both turned
up at the right end amidst frantic applause from Ike.
Dame Acre won without effort, and as she ran the
distance in “4,” with Bst. 121 b. on top, it looks as if
the stable idea about six furlongs being the end of
her tether wanted overhauling, and that with Bst. in
the Doncaster the lady may be entitled to respectful
consideration. Snow King has 7st. 101 b. in the Don-
caster, and the record of having run last in the
Epsom, for which he was a solidly backed second
favorite with Wedge.

No sports-meet, automobile accident or
ice-cream sociable is complete in Hobart without
Tommy Tabart. lie is waylaid by tailors, who
endeavor to get wrinkles from his unwrinkled
clothes, and by the
scions of the most
antique families, who
allow him three letters
of his Christian name.
Possessing the assurance
of a High Court Judge,
he is manager of a dozen
industrial and mining
companies, as well as
secretary and chief talker
for the* Speck’s leading
racing body. His boxing
ability prompts him to
butt in, and at the
recent Cup meet he
personally bounced off
the course a couple of
stubborn undesirables.
He was a solid back
when the Speck’s foot-
ball was in its heyday,
and captained more
than one inter-State
cricket team. His own
gee-gees have a habit of
running second ; and last
year Royal Pride filled
that place in the Hobart,
Launceston and Delo-
raine Cups.
TOM TAB ART, Jun.
Secretary of the
Tasmanian Racing
Club.
They stick to the job of trying to get a
race out of the Cooper stable’s expensive importation
Redfern with a persistence worthy of the barrowload
of cash the animal cost. Latterly he has been gallop-
ing soundly enough on the tracks, and on Saturday he
was given a fly in the six furlongs at Rosehill. There
were preliminary yarns about the race being a cer-
tainty, and misguided punters courageously swallowed
them and took 6 to 4. At no stage of the subsequent
proceedings had they a hope.

If John Wren started Lansell in the
Maiden at Rosehill last week to get a line on his
Doncaster prospects, there was nothing in what hap-
pened to encourage anybody to back him. A big
commission was unshipped on the colt—and it stayed
where it went. He just scrambled into a place.
* * * *
The hurdlers produced on Sydney sub-
urban courses are often a queer lot, and the things
they do are queerer still. This paper thinks fondly
of being there someday when a field is started
and the rest of the hours are spent waiting
for them to get lifted over the timber.
On Saturday at Rosehill there were 14 starters.
One ran off. Another jerked his rider out of
the saddle. A third inflicted fatal injuries on himself.
And the winner, who wandered forth absolutely
unbacked in the ring, cut the journey out in record
time for the course. The second horse was a dozen
lengths behind, the third about 50 yards off, and the
remainder sprinkled over the landscape like a string
of tired cows. Between an unappreciated record-
breaker, well-backed animals that fell down and
others that looked as if they wanted to, the event
had a variegated aspect. #
Weights for the Doncaster and Sydney
Cup kick off with Cetigne in eacli ease. He get 3 9st.
121 b. in the mile and 9st. 51b. in the distance. Solid
helping though this be, there is not much to grumble
about. But the handicapping of Wedge to within
lib. of Cetigne in the Doncaster seems a rather
uncalled-for proceeding. And there might be reason
for lodging a caveat against placing Panacre above
King’s Bounty and counting horses like Quarale,
Kennaquhair, Hitachi, Rebus and Norbury to be sub-
stantially better over a mile than Petalster or the
Epsom winner Satin Bird. Delivered at the start fit
to do his best, Wolaroi (9st. 51b.) would in all pro-
bability show anything that wanted to win good
reason for being in a hurry. But there are others
likely to be in better form on the day. On paper
nothing looks much better than Wedding Day, Petal-
ster, Frank E and Satin Bird among thri first half.
Taking those on the other side who have done some-
thing, Franzae 7st. 31b., Hem 7st. and Yellowmun 7st.
are possibilities at any rate. Hem with 7st. 91b. won
the Christmas Handicap (eight furlongs) at Randwick
in “38J” without being pushed. The Cup field will
be more understandable when the likely starters can be
noticed and they begin to explain how they like the
faster work of the next fortnight. Lingle 9st. lib.,
Thana Bst. 101 b. and Itandos Bst. 101 b. are not badly
treated, though the time ought to be nearly ripe for
Red Pennant, 7st. 91b., to do something if he is ever
going to.
* * * *
There were 146 horses in the Doncaster
Handicap and 103 in Sydney Cup, and there are
nearly 15,000 ways of grouping them in doubles.
Obviously more than half can be ruled out right
away as certain non-starters. There are probably at
least 60 in the Doncaster that at this stage are pos-
sible triers and certainly a couple of dozen in the
Cup that can be described in the same way. Now,
even if the double-pickers limited themselves to these
—which they don’t —just consider the double mer-
chant on a £lOOO book. He was last week laying
them at 200 to 1. Of course it looks long odds, but
the cold fact is that the figures are miles away from
the chances taken by the punter. In a week or two
numerous takers of these odds will reckon they have
a good bet going, and they will be right. But com-
pared with the number whose bet will have evaporated
or be quotable at a heavy discount, they will be as
about 1 is to 100. The worst-off dealer in doubles is
the individual who selects a couple of rank outsiders
to start with. If 20 to 1 chances win the double, £1
would win £4OO on the day. For the Rosehill Flying
and Handicap on Saturday 100 to 1 could be got
about some of the rough Tins; and if a punter had
backed the first winner arid played up the lot on the
next, he could easily have taken out £2OO or more.
* * * *
Racing prophecies, except the llth-hour
ones, must be always based on the assumption of
firm going. What is called the best form of a racer
is the best performance it has accomplished in a
fast-run race. : The fact that it may have done com-
paratively better on a muddy track merely suggests
that its opponents may have done worse than usual,
owing to the weather. Weather in Australia is nor-
mally favorable to good, sound going, so form is
understood to be calculated on normal conditions.
Therefore the calculation is rather differently based
to that of the English form of imported horses, or
even M.L. animals that have never raced a mile on
ground as hard as iron. On any soft track the size
of a racer’s feet may be as much a matter of import-
ance as its style of action. The moral of which is
that form, the least uncertain guide to punters, is in
itself uncertain, and the odds laid by the bookmakers
are sinfully unequal to the uncertainty. Luck,
roguery among jockeys and the mistakes of trainers
in underworking or overworking their horses for the
races in view are thrown into the game to make it
the more ruinous to outside punters, whereas inside
experts are at least good judges of a horse’s condi-
tion on the day of a race, provided they have no
personal interest in it and are not blinded by
prejudice. Some trainers are notoriously shrewd
tipsters regarding everybody’s horses except their
own. Here and there a jockey has a fair capacity
for comparative criticism, but jockeys mostly remain
“boys” in judgment all their days. Owners, as a
rule, get all their ideas from the trainer and jockey,
who may be equally lacking in judgment. Indus-
trious touts are, perhaps, the best class of tipsters.
They go with frayed edges to the legs of their
pants because they are always betting, and luck
plays them many dirty tricks. They back horses for
crowded races round circular or semi-circular courses
where Luck gets many opportunities to operate. Bad
start, bump, “shut in,” stumble, interference, etc.,
are always probabilities against the punter who backs
the good thing, and in favor of the bookie who lays
it. The laws of chance forbid habitual punting.
Ikey Mo is the law-abiding person who lays ’em.

“W.A.C.”: The most exciting item at a
Bananaland bush meeting is the draught-horse race.
Conditions —distance one mile; winner to pull a ton
100 yards. At the Dryrot meeting recently I was invited
into a tip-dray to make up the necessary weight. The
rest of the ton was local Cocky. Dobbin stepped out
to encouraging howls. Then what we didn't expect
happened. When I emerged from the heap of whis-
kers, boots and curses someone whispered in my ear
that he knew the person who loosened the tip-bolt,
and was going to find him. Judging by the crowd in
pursuit of a fleeting form around the track he didn’t
have the secret on his own.
* * * *
“Pick” : The most diminutive jockey ? At
the ’9l Pambula (N.S.W.) race meeting Blackbird,
owned by J.' P. Seceombe, and generally regarded as
an outsider, was so persistently backed to win the
Town Plate that Ikey smelt mice, and started to
lay poison. Seceombe got a whiff of the proceedings
and communed with himself. Then he loaded the
mare with a big stock-saddle and lead, and hoisted
his 31 stone, six-year-old son Edgar on top with
instructions to rush to the front and stay there. The
police began to talk when they noticed the infant
aboard, but as Seceombe claimed he could do as he
liked with his own property, the foorce retired to
read up the law. The race was a pursuit of Black-
bird, and at the finish Israel was smitten with woe.

Davon was a big man, six feet four and
about 25st. weight. On the night before the races
at Moonee Valley he and some friends had made a
good dinner at Menzies’, when one of the party
remarked that he had a • pass to the meeting
which he was unable to avail himself of. Was it
any use to Davon ? “Just the identical,” said
Davon. Next day he duly handed the disc to the
gatekeeper, who promptly staggered. “Man alive,”
he gasped, “there are no elephant races here to-
day ! ” Davon’s friend had palmed off on him a
jockey’s nass.

“Spreader”: Carbine blood is in the
heavily-backed topweight, as well as the lighter-
weighted actual winner, of the Australian Cup.
Whenever any of Carbine’s descendants get into the
limelight members of the Clerks’ Union and other
horsey men refer in terms of respectful admiration
to the magic Musket strain. They are all wrong.
Camel is the horse that deserves all the credit,
through his daughter Brown Bess. Carbine’s sire
was out of a daughter of Bess. His dam Mersey
was by a son of the same mare, and as Mersey
threw a first-flighter to Musket and another (Car-
nage) to a son of Musket, it looks as if there was
something, after all, in the scientific Brown Bess
nick. The other quadrupeds produced by matings
of Musket and Mersey were such a poor lot that it
would be a shame to include them in any decent
theory on breeding.

From Malmsbury (Vic.) comes breathless

When Fred Berry (N.S.W.) tried to put
up fresh motor-cycle figures between Sydney and
Melbourne he smashed the forks of his machine at
Wodonga (Vic.). As he was running just on schedule
time he looked about for something to kick for his
bad luck. Nothing being handy, he went on to Mel-
bourne, and after a rest decided to have a tilt at the
record from that end. Last week, with C. Sainty in
a side-car, Berry started on the 565-mile trip, and
despite a 40min. block at Gundagai, pulled the figures
down to 22hr. 20min. Jim Bolger put up the pre-
vious record (23hr. 40inin.) on a solo machine. Berry
was aboard a 7h.p. Harley-Davidson, with Barnet
Glass tyres.

With two rounds to go in Sydney premier-
ship cricket, Petersham, Balmain and Waverley each
have a chance of hitting the top. The season has
been a see-saw between Petersham and Balmain, each
having won seven matches and lost three; but Waver-
ley, with six wins and four losses, is in the rosier
position with only Gordon to play and a bye. Mean-
time Sydney, which took the prize last year, is giving
Middle Harbor a hand to hold up the tail.

C. V. Grimmett (South Melbourne), who
has stirred Victorian cricket this season by taking 40
wickets averaging 13.4 each, was in Sydney in other
years. In premiership matches he took 28 averaging
10.64 during ’l4-’l5 (the best was 12 for 65 against
Redfern), 59 averaging 20.72 in ’l5-’l6, and 20 at
a cost of 17.3 last year.


There is a WAY to Perfect
Health.
That way is open to you. Will you travel it ?
The only way to improve Nature is through NATL RAL
methods.
Drugs and apparatus usually show no results and are oiten
injurious. Under my method 15 minutes each day in your
own room is sufficient. I have thousands of students in all
parts of Australia and New Zealand who are now enjoying
good health. Previously a great number of these people
were sufferers from indigestion, constipation and other dis-
orders which are the direct result of the internal muscles
being much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health'? Then why not
write to-dav for full particulars of my

“Dear Sir, —I have practised the third set of exercises,
together with the other sets, and feel stronger than ever.
I have increased 91b. in weight.
“Yours faithfully,

Many hundreds of letters from pupils throughout Australia

CONSTANT HEADACHES
People with thin blood are much more sub-
ject to headaches than full-blooded persons,
and the form of anaemia that affects grow-
ing girls is almost always accompanied by
headache, together with digestive disturb-
ances and constipation.
Whenever you have constant or recurring
headaches and pallor of the face they show
that the blood is thin, and your efforts should
be directed towards building up your blood.
A treatment with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
will do this effectively, and the rich, red
blood will remove the headache.
More disturbances to health are caused
by thin blood than you have any idea of.
When the blood is impoverished the nerves
suffer from lack of nourishment, and you
may have insomnia, neuritis, neuralgia or
sciatica. Muscles subject to strain are
under-nourished, and you may have muscu-
lar rheumatism or lumbago. If your blood
is thin and you begin to show symptoms of
these disorders, try building up the blood
with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills and see if
the symptoms do not disappear as the blood
is restored to normal.

the Nervous System,” to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Box 594 G.P.0., Sydney.

pills, or they will be sent, post paid, at 2/9

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

Mr. Edison’s
Secret
It will mean more to you and your, family
to possess a New Edison than any other
musical instrument you could name.
The NEW EDISON
has a true-to-life tone.
It brings out all those overtones and fine shades of sound that give volume,
purity and richness to the tone ; it does what all music-lovers appreciate —
it Re-creates the living voice—or any instrument—exactly as originally
rendered.
Commenting on a tone test recently made by a world-famed artist, singing
in comparison with her own voice, the Cleveland Leader reports:—
“Christine Miller herself and Christine Miller on The NEW EDISON sang
side by side. The two voices were so identical that when one or the other
was stopped it was impossible to detect it in the audience. .. .which was
composed of the most cultured musicians.”
Hundreds of such reports have appeared in large, influential and conserva-
tive newspapers.

Things seem to be going nice and smoothly
now with this co., except, of course, that
the war has disturbed the foreign market
into which it was steadily pushing, and in
which, in course of time, Australia ought to
be a very large factor. There was an old
story that Australia couldn’t make leather
because the climate doesn’t suit. But that
excuse for loafing is nearly played out. It
nearly choked off the sheep-breeding busi-
ness in Australia in the first place, and it
did choke off the butter business for many
years—and then Queensland and the N. S.
Wales North Coast, the places which of all
others ought to be the most unsuitable
according to the old lie, proved themselves
easily the most suitable. Now and again,
of course, we get nasty knocks, because the
Australian workman is an independent per-
son who has some opinions of his own, and
we scold him for striking. But we don’t
want to get it into our heads that that is the
end of all our hopes. It may do us a bit of
good sometimes to reflect that in many cases
the qualities that produce strikes are the
very qualities that make superior workmen.
The placid, pattering, pottering Indian
doesn’t strike. The Australian wouldn’t,
either, if he was no better than the Indian.
We have been magnifying our strikes lately
to make political capital out of them ; and
that is no good. Indeed, we have come .to
this point: that the anti-Labor political par-
ties are promoting and intensifying indus-
trial troubles and difficulties for political
purposes. Australia will have to watch this
development very carefully and stamp upon
it hard whenever it shows itself.
The old-established Ludowici’s capital is
£56,644, and its liabilities on all accounts on
December 31 were £11,262. It is a business
in which not much capital is required for
plant (premises and plant run to only
£20,430) ; but stock in various stages takes
£46.353 to support it. The balance of about
£11.500 is in book debts and War Loan and
other investments.

W. 11. Twelvetrees, State Geologist of
Tasmania, has published an excellent circu-
lar on “The Search for Petroleum in Tas-
mania.” The history of the hunt for oil is
stated from the first finding of bitumen on
the West Coast to the failure to strike oil
at North Bruny Island with a drilling rig.
The monograph sums up the Tasmanian oil
situation thus: —
The two fields which offer the best off-chance of
discovery of native oil in Tasmania are, as far as at
present known: —•
(1) The Launceston Tertiary basin, in which
rapidly alternating beds of sand, clay and lignite
recur to a proved depth of 900 feet, and probably
persist for a few hundred feet deeper. The organic
muds of these beds are potentially favorable for oil
genesis.
(2) The Gondwana sand beds of the midlands,
where salt-pans are known to exist in various locali-
ties.
Up to the present the Department has no definite
knowledge of undoubted indications, but in view of
the benefits derivable from the opening of a petroleum
field in Tasmania, and in view of the reasonable
assumption that there is nothing exceptional in the
physical characteristics and conditions of sedimenta-
tion which would militate against the formation of
oil, it recommends renewed search for surface evi-
dences, and invites prompt communication of any
discoveries made, in order that no time may be lost
in visiting and examining the sites of alleged finds.
Altogether it is the most encouraging docu-
ment so far issued by any of the Australian
State Geologists about petroleum.

“Oof Bird”: An association has been
formed in Perth to revive Westralian mining.
Prospectors, leaseholders, investors, specu-
lators and others who want to see the in-
dustry livened up are invited to join. One
of the main objects is to agitate for the
removal of the disabilities under which those
opening up mines now labor. Affiliation
with the Primary Producers, otherwise the
Country Party, is suggested, but nothing
definite has yet been done. In my opinion
the Association should free itself entirely
of the Melbourne and Adelaide company pro-
moter. Let small syndicates of speculators
be formed to go into mining for themselves.
Why should not the public in Perth or Ival-
goorlie or Cue deal direct with a lease or
group of leases at Tilgarn, East Coolgardie,
Mt. Margaret or the Murchison? These
syndicates must have no vendor’s interest
and should be possessed of substantial work-
ing capital, and their formation on such lines
would probably do more to revive mining
than anything else.
* * * *
The high cost of mining in Westralia is
gradually shutting down the low-grade
mines, and these are a few of the already-
deserted or almost-deserted towns: Peak
Hill,' of Darlington-Simpson fame ; Nannine ;
Jasper Hill, where Hans Irvine’s bubble
burst after six months’ crushing • Day Dawn,
where the Great Fingall is languishing; Mt.
Magnet, where the Morning Star. St. George,
etc., are now closed down; Sandstone (Black
Range and Oroya) ; Lawlers (Great East-
ern) ; Warriedar. Mt. Morgans. Yalgoo
(Emerald). Yum (Yuin Reef; under exemp-
tion). Leonora (now existing on the Sons
of Gwalia), Menzies. Kanowna. Soutl ern
Cross. Cue. Coolgardie. And the list could
bo extended by many others.

Collins-street is being offered interests in
molybdenite shows at Everton. near Wanga-
ratta (Vic.). The mineral occurs in quartz
and granite gangues, and rich specimen stuff
is being passed round by those who cot in
early. This is not the first time of offering;
but hitherto investors have been coy, as word
got about that the field was patchy. Most
molybdenite shows are.

Mary is married
Jacks' at the front
A ND the many happy evenings you used to
spend en famille are gone—never to return.
Even when Jack’s booming baritone once more
fills the house—he will miss Mary’s accompani-
ments. You know he never could get past ragtime.
In the meantime you and mother
are dreading the silent evenings of
the coming months. They stretch
ahead in a seeming eternity of
ennui. You have both so long de-
pended on the “youngsters” for
amusement that any talent you once
possessed yourselveshas rusted away
into uselessness. But there is a
way—the Beale Player way—to
realise all the enjoyment that you
think you are going to miss. The
“Beale” Player-Piano has every
attribute of the straight Beale-Piano
—including the steel tuning system
—together with a Player mechanism
of faultless technique. It also
excels in tone control. Thus it
enables anyone musically inclined
to give full rein to their musical
thoughts. On the “Beale,” one
plays almost instinctively—the
mechanism is so sensitive and
instantly responsive to the delicate
controlling devices. Informal
concerts held dafly.
Call and ask to hear a favourite composition
played the Beale-Player way. It will open
up a wonderful field of enjoyment for you.

A little talk on the
care of your lamps
FILL daily—with “Laurel”- so that the reser-
voir may be nearly full when the lamp is
lighted. Not too full —oil, when warm,
expands; allow for expansion. Don’t fill the
lamp when burning.
The contents of the reservoir
should be emptied at least once
a month to remove dust and
settlings.
When the lamp is not burning,
see that the wick is turned down
below the top of the wick tube.
Keep the burners clean— the com-
mon causeof odour is the clogging
of the tiny air holes at the base of
the burner under the cap, and the
crust which forms at the top of
the wick tube. These openings
must be kept free, because they
supply the air, without which,
there could not be proper com-
bustion.
I f the air passages become clogged
the flame will fail and emit an
unpleasant odour.
Boil burners occasionally in a
solution of sal soda and water,
which will soften and aid in re-
moving the crust.
Be sure the wick fits.
For lamps with flat wicks, trim
the wick daily, cutting off the
burned portion evenly across the
top with sharp scissors, and also
slightly at the corners.
The wicks on lamps with a centre
draught, or taking a circular wick,
should not be cut. Turn the wick
up till only the charred portion is
exposed, and rub off evenly from
left to right, always in same
direction.
Wicks should be replaced once a
month, or as soon as they become
dirty. A new wick should be
thoroughly dried before putting
it in the lamp.
If your wick is too short to reach the oil, never put water into
your lamp to raise the oil. If the water reaches wick, it Will
moisten it and prevent proper burning.
Use good kerosene. The best brand is “Laurel
the soft, white light.
Don’t ask for “Kerosene” —say “Laurel ” It is our
new trade mark name for the highest. quality
American kerosene ever sold in Australasia.

To give the Huns more for their crime ;
So straight was their line Wally counted for nine ;

For settling the Hun’s gun and killing its crew ;
And also a bar to the Military Cross,
For the officer said he was worthy of it, he knew.

Ferret: Sorry, wholly unsuitable for illustration....
D.D.T.: Quite true; but it is merely illustrative™
it doesn’t preach a sermon, as a cartoon should.
More about medical fees,«from “Dr. Nil”
this time: —
“A.11.A.” (B. 28/2/’18) wants payment of med-
ical men “by results,” and stoppage of all payment
during illness of patients. I don’t know whether
the lady is aware of it, but this method is laid at
the door of the Chinese monarchs, who have always
been krtown as the most progressive aristocracy in
the most scientific country in the world. Their
example alone should be sufficient to show that
“A.H.A.” is right. But she says at the end of her
letter: “Doubtless there are details that I have over-
looked.” There are ! There are, indeed !
Under the present system the more trifling ail-
ments that people call in the doctor for, the more
will be the bill. So they prevent malingering. Who
in “A.II.A.’s” scheme is to prevent malingering?
It would be to the family’s interest to promote it,
because this (unless bowled out by some independent
tribunal) would secure a stoppage of payment of
all fees to the doctor.
Now, if father is well but drinking hard, and if
mother is well but about to be attended in a con-
finement by a Mrs. Gamp (all risks thrown on the
doctor), if Ethelbert is teething and Ethelberta is
suffering from the attentions of an abortionist —ye
gods, tell me what is the poor man who only lives to
cut up his fellow-idiots to do? Ethelbert’s teeth
would stop poor Pillgarliek’s screw from that family !
As for operations and the cost being borne by
the “family physician,” no medical slave would
think of doing one outside of a Government hos-
pital, where the visitation of God could not always
be revisited on the poor man who must get up at
1 a.m. and dash off to give little Tommy his castor-
oil, even though the barber-surgeon (to this he will
have been dragged back by “A.11.A.”) is ill him-
self and has never been paid by Tommy’s (reputed)
father.
These are only a few of the “details that I have
overlooked.” One other, for instance: What would
the Coroner say if it were implied by con-
tract that it was the doctor’s fault every time a
patient died? Let “A.H.A.” imagine herself that
unknown bird, a woman working a screw-cutting
lathe in Australia. And what would she say if
her wages ceased because there were bubbles in
the castings?
And a lot more.
“L.E.A.” (London) : I take off my hat to
the Australian mother who called to-day to
see about the transfer of her soldier son to
a neutral country. He chased the Hun so
hard that he was prisoner soon after the age
?f 16; a second boy was 16 when he arrived
in London with a later contingent; a third
son, at the age of 15, is in the Navy, and
a smter has gone into a military hospital
Their father was a British officer.

This Tyre Will Suit Your Needs
Consider the requisites for an
ideal motor tyre —the quality
of materials needed, the ex-
pert construction, the type of
labor, and the manufacturing
equipment necessary to weld
them effectively together.
Besides these, consider the
factors that have part in the
making of every Goodyear
Tyre—the care spent in
choosing materials, the ex-
perience behind their construc-
tion, the skill of Goodyear
workmen, and the great fac-
tories in which they labor.
We believe you will find the
two —the ideal and the real
—astonishingly in alignment.
We believe you will find
Goodyear Tyres to come
nearer your wish in all things,
than you believed possible.
We build them to embody all
the quality material that we
are able to command through
our vast organization and
improved practice.
We build them to serve in a
manner befitting a product on
which is staked the present suc-
cess and future development of a
great institution.
Through intensified factory me-
thod, and nationally effective
distribution, we are able to mar-
ket them at a price companioning
economy with satisfaction.
Now and henceforward Goodyear
Tyres should be on your car —
by every reason of efficiency and
value.

WHICH IS BETTER? Sometimes Books, Sometimes Tote.
THE TOTEX, a new invention, tells at a glance without calculation which
is better in each case before the race for any horse, any race, any time, no
matter how many runners, or whether one, two or three dividends paid, or whether
tickets 5/-, 10/-, £l, or £5.
THE TOTEX also tells whether favorite to win or any other horse finishing
second or third is the better investment.
THE TOTEX also tells after the race the approximate dividends payable
for first when one dividend paid, first and second when two dividends paid, and
first, second and third when three dividends paid.
THE TOTEX thows light on investing, and each investor knows which
institution will pay best in each case before the race.
THE TOTEX is indispensable now it is an accomplished fact. No more
careless waste of money in taking 6-1 from the books when the Tote paid 9-1 as
in Bombita’s Squatters, and Tote 6-1 as in Pah King's Clibborn, when Books gave
12-1.

THE TOTEX is the only book of its kind in the world. It tells you without fail

of no assistance to the actor’s stomach.
The film rights of Dennis’s “Sentimental
Bloke” have been disposed of for a sum
running into four figures.
“Cockaigne”: Forbes Robertson, engaged
by Hugh Ward for Australia, was notably
associated with the Bancrofts and Irving,
and developed slowly into a star. His Ham-
let was the best on the English stage after
the retirement of Booth and Irving. Sym-
pathy distinguishes him; wherefore his
trump card has been “The Passing of the
Third Floor Back,” introduced to Australia
by Matheson Lang. Robertson made a for-
tune from this in the United States. Another
trump is “The Light that Failed,” not seen
in Australia for a long time. He will draw,
although he has retired from the English
theatres. His wife, Gertrude Elliott, is
Maxine’s sister.
The Maoriland Government has appointed
veteran Tom Follard adviser to the Minister
of Inteimal Affairs in regard to the censor-
ship of cino films. The first job he had was
to fix up a scheme for exhibiting the official
war pictures, which have hitherto been in
the hands of the Y.M.C.A. without conspicu-
ous success. The old general’s appointment
seems to have pleased everybody. It is the
second time he has been in Government show
employ. He was Director of Entertain-
ments in the M.L. International Exhibition
of 3906-7.
“W.P.T.”: Peter Dawson’s enlistment re-
minded me of poor old Tom Dawson, whose
grave is in France. I’ll never forget when
he was up for promotion. “Come out and
drill this squad,” said the 0.C.; “I’ll see
how you shape.” Tom was told to open the
squad out. The word of command is,
“Odd Numbers Front Rank, Two Paces For-
ward ; Even Numbers Rear Rank, Two Paces
Step Back; March.” Tom got slightly
mixed, but threw his chest out and shouted in
his best voice: “Odd Numbers Front Rank,
Two Paces Forward ; Even Money the Rear
Rank.” He got his stripe.
The names of IS members wbo figure in
the cast of the war drama are inscribed on
an honor board which was unveiled at Mel-
bourne Greenroom Club by Bert Bailey.
Two of the number —Max Clifton, who took
part in a hundred stage scraps, and comedian
Tom Dawson—will never return to the
footlights.
“Fax”: Emile Vanderveldt tells the story.
Five thousand Petrograd factory hands, who
were already getting three times their former
wages, demanded of the firm that the in-
crease should date back to the beginning of
the war. The total back pay was 36 million
roubles, and the hopeful workers brought
13 sacks to the conference. These were to
be filled with cash within 24 hours, other-
wise the honest unionists would fill them
with the 13 directors and throw them into
the Neva. But whilst they were locked in
the directors sent a message to the Minister
of Labor, and he came round and convinced
the 5000 workmen that the retrospective rise
was an impossibility. Whereupon they
politely withdrew their claim and begged the
bosses’ pardon for their little mistake. It
reminds me of two showmen, long dead and
gone, who had to deal with a little crowd
from Switzerland. Pete Hughes and Jenkins
brought the Jungfrau Kapelle jodellers to
Australia on a contract which guaranteed
them return passage to Europe at the end
of the tour. There was no specified length
of time ( for the tour, but it turned out an
unexpected boon and lasted a year or so. The
Swiss rustics in velveteen and cross-garters
had never before earned so much salary. The
only cloud on their happiness was the loss
of one of the brethren, who had died before
he was able to earn much salary, and was
duly buried by the management. When,
at last, they came to receive their return-
passage money a spirit of unrest was ap-
parent among the musical aliens, and Hughes
and Jenkins wondered what was in the wind.
They quickly found out. As soon as the last
songster was paid off, the jodellers all re-
turned to the office in a deputation to
demand the passage-money of their defunct
comrade!
“0.K.”: “Turn to the Right,” according
to managerial ad., “comes like a breath of
fresh air from the mountains.” Quite so.
The prologue consists of conversation con-
cerning gaol and burglary between three
young men in a pawnshop, two greasy old
Jews being in the background. The Ist Act
ends with a droll case of safe-breaking and
pocket-picking, followed by the departure of
the “crooks” to a prayer-meeting. Act 2
terminates in the arrest of an educated felon
for persistently robbing his old man. The
drama is full of mountain air.
Reg Wykeham sends a cheerful tip (end
of 1917) from France, where he has had a
long spell of soldiering:—
Loved ones ’neath the wattle-trees
Cull this message from the breeze:
Next year from across the seas
Christmas brings us home.
No one ever caught the ex-actor without his
optimism—not even when he ran a pub at
Beira. Portuguese East Africa, where the
Ten Commandments are not exactly insisted
upon and a civil w 7 ord is apt to be mis-
understood.
“F.H.”: Back to Melbourne, after spend-
ing one-seventh of his life at the Front and
sharing the glory of Messines Ridge and
Broodseinde, young Bill West, a Wesley
boy who earned his pre-war crust with the
A.M.P. Bill belongs to a family which has
made a vast amount of mixed music in its
time. Dad Hautrie West holds the record
as long-time double-bass player at the Tiv.
- —-22 years of it. Nowadays he is at the
Princess’s. Uncle Haydn West has a useful
reputation as a piano-practitioner and writer
of tone-poems; while grand-dad Hautrie
West, of Ballarat, teaches the young musical
idea how to shoot in the big-organ gallery.
Dad and uncle both did orchestra work with
Marshall Hall in the kultured days of the
old Conservatorium.
"THE ENEMY WITHIN ,” AT THE
SYDNEY STRAND.
Snowy Baker qualifies as an Australian
movie hero by throwing half, a dozen
traitors about.
“Ancient Prompter”: Australia’s old, not
to say venerable, footlights friend Nat
Goodwin has come to light again on the
American stage. He is starring, in a comedy
entitled “Why Marry?” Nathaniel, who
has been married and divorced more times
than any man on the boards, knows how to
make the best of his misfortunes.
“Bluebeard”: Whilst away from Aus-
tralia, Muriel Starr acted “on Broadway”
—every mummer’s ambition. She was
Lady Langworthy in May Martindale’s play,
“Gamblers All,” at the Maxine Elliott
Theatre. The authoress is the daughter of
the writer of “Jim tbe Penman,” made popu-
lar in this country by Harry St. Maur.
Ronald Squire, an English actor, and Muriel
got the best notices of May’s poor play,
which hobbles round a woman gambler in
difficulties. Daisy Belmore, who was in
Australia with Wilson Barrett, and married
one of the local Waxman family, was also in
the cast. One New York critic’s idea of the
show: “A prehistoric ark afloat on an ante-
diluvian flood of prattle.” It hqfl a short
but stormy voyage.
“Lab”: A recent par. about a much-
travelled veteran mummer led me to search
for a flimsy green handbill, and a night of
drizzle came back to me. Mr. and Mrs.
were billed to give a performance on
the only famous goldfield in India, and two
Cornishmen and I tramped three miles to see
it. The place required special advertising
to secure anything of a “house,” a fact
evidently unknown to the visitors. We
arrived to find that we three would probably
constitute the audience; but after a time
two or three Eurasian lads came along.
Under the circumstances w T e had given up
all idea of a performance, and had not both-
ered to go inside. We sat chatting
on the doorkeeper’s table (there was no
doorkeeper) waiting for the drizzle to stop.
About the time when the show should have
started, the veteran joined us, and that
man was a sport. He hadn’t a grouse about
him —merely said in a pleasant way some-
thing about bad luck. We proceeded to
explain local conditions and how the game
ought to be played. There was no hotel,
and one of the dressing-rooms was obviously
being used as such. After allowing any pos-
sible late-arrivals a feyv minutes’ grace, the
mummer suggested that it was time to be
“getting on with the show.” We said we
would not hear of it, and were quite content
to go and let him get to bed (in the dressing-
room) ; but he was not prepared to agree to
that, and after some argument, very pleas-
antly conducted, suggested that we should
toss for it—the winner to do as he liked.
He won the toss, and said, with cheerfulness
apparently : “Well, that means we give the
show.” So the audience of six trooped in,
and the mummer and his wife (the only
attractions billed) conscientiously went
through the programme. The audience was
very appreciative. Since then I’ve often
wondered whether he was so fond of getting
blank-yerse off his chest that any old oppor-
tunity would do, or did he (poor soul, I hope
not!) need the money?
“J.F.11.” (London) : “The Maid of the
Sunny South” is announced as the principal
Christmas production at Manchester; and as
Oscar Asclie is the producer there may be
something Australian in it. But more likely
there isn’t, Spain and Italy being the Sunny
South from the viewpoint of the Fog. Asche
produced the enormously successful “Maid of
the Mountains” at Daly’s, London, so its
boss, Robert Evett, naturally secured his
services for the similar Manchester show.
THE ACTOR’S AVIARY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Said Hyphen-Howler, once a star, but now
A dim, obscure and faded satellite:
“They will not have me act, but, anyhow,
I am an artist still; I can recite!
“Since melodrama uses me so ill,
A lower plane my art shall glorify;
Pll quit the stage and take to vaud-e-ville I
Yes, Bernhardt did it, damme! So shall I!”
A scone from Shakspeare, passionate, profound,
A fitting medium for his turn supplied—
llis turn! He shuddered at the very sound!
And so did all the managers he tried.
He kept on pestering them from day to day,
Till one, more sympathetic than the rest,
Promised a trial at a matinCe,
To put his great recital to the test.
At making ready for the fateful hour
Old Hyphen-Howler happily perspired,
And sought the menial —misanthropic, sour- 1 —
Who furnished any “properties” required.
“My man,” said he, with condescending grace,
“I’Ve here the list of props, you must supply !”
The caitiff made an impolite grimace,
And scanned the paper with a bilious eye.
“ ‘Best furniture. Some statues. Rugs,’ ”he read—
“ ‘A handsome carpet, covering all the stage.
Rich curtains. Pictures.’ Very well!” he said,
“But, bli’-me, Mister, you’ve forgot the cage!”
The actor frowned. “What need I with a cage?”
Then Props, relit a damaged cigarette.
“You’ll need a big ’un, matey, I’ll engage,
You’ll want it f’r the bird you’re goin’ to get!”

THE HYPOCHONDRIACTRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though on the stage, unknown to fame
Was Mary Jones, who seemed to lack
All talent; but she made a name
By turning hypochondriac.
We had not heard aught of her art
Until we read about her ills;
The lady really got a part
By taking Screecham’s Liver Pills.
Next simple citizens were told,
Beneath her photo, in the press,
That she was ne’er without a cold
Till Scottish Moss cured her distress.
Her name was blazoned far and wide
As one who suffered from catarrh ;
Then Podger’s Nasal Douche she tried,
And very soon became a star.
Craig’s Bunion Plasters helped her, too;
Tubb’s Magic Tonic did its bit;
Each week her public larger grew,
Till now she’s an undoubted “hit.”
Though it may cause all thinkers grief,
Playgoers have, in point of fact,
Been “drugged” into the quaint belief
That Mary Jones can really act!

In the Overland Big Four-cylinder touring
car and the Overland Light Four-cylinder
touring car, the luxurious and the practical
are in proper balance to produce lasting satis-
faction.
The Big Four is finished in a deep rich
brown, while the colour of the Light Four is
a beautiful shade of gray.
These two models exemplify the remark-
able values made possible by tremendous pro-
duction.
Size does not of itself constitute greatness.
An industry is as great as its service to
the public.
But size does usually constitute oppor-
tunity for service.
In the case of Willys-Overland, size origi-
nally was an indication of foresight and courage.
It constituted an opportunity to establish
new values in motor cars was a service.
Growth came as a reward of this service,
and with growth came opportunity for further
service—further revision of values.
Today’s immensity means experience,
facilities and resources, plus the public con-
fidence, which gives these things stability for
yet greater service.
The Willys-Overland ideal of service is in-
tegrity of value in • the product throughout
the whole life of that product s service.
The Willys-Overland Motor Cars which
we have to show you exemplify this ideal
and constitute the most comprehensive range
of models ever built by any one motor car
producer.

Simple and Effective Methods.

London, Eng.
The Killing of Superfluous Hair.
It is easy to remove superfluous hair tem-
porarily, but to remove it permanently is
quite another matter. Not many women
know that for this purpose such a simple
substance as powdered pheininol may be
used, applied directly to the hair. The recom-
mended treatment is designed not merely to
instantly remove the hair, but also to event-
ually kill the roots entirely. Almost any
chemist could supply an ounce of pheminol,
which quantity should be sufficient.
Renewing Complexions by Absorption.
If your complexion is marred with eallow-
ness, moth patches, pimples or freckles, it is
useless to potter with powders and paints,
lotions, creams and things in an effort to get
rid of the trouble. Unless you have some
ability as an artist, you will mar your ap-
pearance still more. The new and rational
way is to take off the complexion itself, with
all its offensive marks. Just get some pure
mercolized wax at the chemist’s and use at
night the same as cold cream. Remove next
morning with water and soap, following with
dash of cold water. The mercolized wax
absorbs the half-dead scarf skin in flaky
particles, so gradually that no one guesses
you are treating your face—unless it be by
(lie result, which is truly wonderful. There
is nothing like it for bestowing a natural,
healthy and beautiful complexion.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly
corrected by a unique new process. A tablet
of stymol, obtained from the chemist, is
dropped in a tumbler of hot water, which will
then of course “fizz” briskly. When the
effervescence has subsided the face is bathed
with the stymol-cliarged water and then dried
with a towel. The offending blackheads, of
their own accord, come right off on the
towel, the large oily pores immediately con-
tract and efface themselves naturally. There
is no squeezing, forcing, or any drastic,
action. The skin is left uninjured, smooth,
soft and cool. A few such treatments should
be taken at intervals of three or four days
thereafter in order to insure the permanence
of the pleasing result so quickly obtained.
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often down-right injurious. Pew people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless man-
ner. You have only to get two ounces of
taramalite concentrate from your chemist and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum to prove
this. Apply this simple and harmless lotion
for a few nights to the hair with a small
sponge, and the greyness will gradually dis-
appear. The lotion is neither sticky nor
greasy and has been proved over and over
again for generations past by those in pos-
session of the formula.
About Shampoos.
To quote an eminent London beauty
specialist: “The slimy egg cannot dissolve
the scalp impurities, but only adds to the
trouble by completely choking the pores with
animal matter.” The substance sticks, de-
composes, thereby causing the hair to assume
a dead, “dull color.” , Avoid eggs (and soap
too) on your hair. Try the delightful pre-
paration made by stirring a teaspoonful of
stallax in a cup of hot water. It will bring
out new beauty possibilities in your hair,
will clear and prevent dandruff, and leave
that fine fluffy effect so much sought after.
It also removes excess oil or greasiness. [1

14th March, 1918. FORREST, Treasurer.
Norman Marshall, son of Melbourne’s
reverend doc., who went into Broadmeadows
as a recruit in 1914, is now a lieut.-colonel
and wears the M.C. and D.S.O. He was
married last year in London to a daughter
of Dr. Black, of St. Kilda-road. For a son-
in-law Dr. Black has one of the most popular
men in the A.I.F.
“R.W.” from a sloppy trench: —
We’ve just heard the result of the Referendum.
Lord knows what’s going to happen now ! I suppose
we’ll just have to keep on splitting up until there's not
enough left to split, and then turn it in. Some wag
said that they’d only need two ships to take the
Australians home —one for the staff and the other for
the identification discs.
Donald Mackinnon, M.L.A., Director-Gen-
eral of Recruiting in Victoria, has stated in
the Botanical Garden of Ballarat that any-
body who obstructs Australia’s war work
must go. Well, the prize obstructionist is
something of a goer. He goes out in the
Government motor-car. He goes to the
country now and then. He goes the pace
in the matter of loans. He goes the whole
hog in the matter of speeches. He goes
almost everywhere to see if a royal com-
mission is needed. He goes into details to
show that the country can’t do without him.
And once he did go—but it proved next day
that he wasn’t gone.
The crackling successes of General
Cbauvel, of the Australian Light Horse,
recall the part his father, C. H. Chauvel,
owner of Tabulam, played in a smaller
shooting drama in ’6B, at Drake (N.S.W.).
“Yarry” and “Neddy,” two aboriginals,
charged with the murder of a white man
on Bonalbo, were in the lockup on remand.
The constable, on drawing the bolt to give
the prisoners their breakfast, was over-
powered, and the blacks made off for the
scrub. A young bushman gave chase and
promptly shot both fugitives dead. Three
J’s.P., Chauvel, Robertson and Ellis,
solemnly returned the verdict, “Shot in self-
defence by T. Marsh.”
“Hamer”: There are periodical shakings
of the military tree to jolt the hundreds of
shy soldier-birds from their snug English
nests, and get them over to France. But
it’s a heartbreaking job. The official shaker
goes into orderly-rooms, stores, offices, cook-
houses, post offices, mess-huts and canteens,
and the slackers tremble —until they get
used to it. Just when it seems that a gun-
shy flock are caught at last, a crop of harm-
less new jobs springs up, and, with sighs of
relief, the slackers fall back into them.
Amongst the other things that have just
been found necessary in one Australian
training group in Britain is a concert party
—members to be given exemption from ser-
vice for three months. Oh, why didn’t I
persevere with my singing lessons years ago!
How long does it take to learn the bones?
“Maphsu”: Here is a tale of two Russian
Jews, a chemist and a dentist respectively.
They were in America at the time the Czar
lost his job, and, with high hopes of finding
a free Russia, started off to reach their
country via Japan. When they arrived in
Nippon, however, Russia had run wild, so
they decided instead to come to Australia.
The passports issued to them in America by
the consul of a Russia that was then officially
republican, were vised by the British em-
bassies in Hong Kong and Japan. When
the travellers reached Sydney the other day
they were practically broke. Now what
stupid official is responsible for -what hap-
pened next? Their passports, vised, were
dishonored, because they did not bear the
Russian Imperial arms! The two men were
not allowed to land and are to be sent back
to' Japan as steerage passengers.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant” :—•
Apropos the burial the other day of Melbourne’s
patriarchal undertaker Apps. The pioneer of the
gloomy business in the city was Robert Frost, car-
penter and joiner, who commenced to look sad in
Collins-street at the end of 1838, This Bob Frost
married the widow of John Shanks, who kept a pub in
Flinders-street. Frost was alive, to my knowledge,
in the late ’sixties. The next was Samuel Crook,
who put on the weepers in January, 1840, in Wil-
liam-street, near the wharf. He built a hearse,
which he announced would be let out on hire. Then
came Thomas Croft, who, as his “card” said, “com-
bines the office of sexton and undertaker and per-
forms funerals on the shortest notice and most
reasonable terms.” He added a “mourning hearse”
to the equipment. After him came Tom Jennings,
who kept at it till 1884. In the first ’fifties Crook
took a partner, John Sleight, and that name con-
tinues to this day. About the same time came John
Daley, who had all the R.C. business. The late
Apps’s big competitor was William George Raven,
of Fitzroy and Collingwood. He “worked” the
friendly societies.
Made his last flight, in Mesopotamia, on
February 19, Captain C. A. .Parker, M.C.
and bar. He was a Launceston (Tas.) boy,
but being in Queensland when Germany
decided that the time was ripe he enlisted in
the Light Horse. He was with the First
Division on Gallipoli, and then after a few
months with the Artillery was picked by
Birdwood for the Flying Corps. In this work
he gained his captaincy, the M.C. and bar,
and was then transferred to the R.F.C.
Special Reserve for service in Mesopotamia.
He was the only son of Erskine Parker, the
T.T.C. handicapper, and was just 26.
How an Australian padre died
On November 7 the infantry failed in an attack
on Sheria, some six or eight miles from Beersheba,
and the Light Horse were ordered to attack. During
the charge a number fell, and one, Trooper Foster,
was seen by the chaplain, W. J. Dunbar, to rise and
attempt to I'egain the lines. In doing so he
drew the Turkish fire and almost immediately fell.
Once more he struggled to his knees. Then Dunbar,
calling for a stretcher-bearer to follow him, charged
out to bring the struggling man in. Before going
many yards the padre himself was dropped, shot
through the thigh. Managing to rise, however, he
again pushed on towards Foster. He reached him,
too, but found him already dead. Just as he and
the bearer were on the point of returning, a machine-
gun was turned on them. Dunbar fell, riddled.
Dodd, the stretcher-bearer, was also wounded, but
managed to get back to the lines. This padre
Dunbar was a native of Orange, and was shepherding
at Tilba Tilba before he got into khaki—as a pri-
vate to begin with. To panegyrise a man like that
is superfluous. His record is the only praise he needs.

FROM PORT AUGUSTA MR. BURTON LEFT THE BEATEN TRACK, via Adelaide and Melbourne, and
struck out across the desert and WASHOUTS FOR BROKEN HILL. The nature of this country can be
imagined when it is shown above that it took 38 hours to do 404 miles on an average of only 10.6 miles per hour.
It is worthy of note that the only spares carried by the motorists were a Crown heel, a Stub Axle and two Main Spring Leaves, none of
which were needed. They depended entirely on their Electric Installation for Lights.
The whole performance speaks volumes for Hupmobiße Reliability and Service.

THE thing that the people should have
been allowed to realise from the outset
is that WE MAY GET A LICKING. We
still may get a licking. Are you, going to
let the Ravisher of Belgium win without
lifting a hand?
J. L. Williams, Under-Secretary of N. S.
Wales Justice Department, is now a captain
and a weird thing called a Deputy-Assistant-
Judge-Advocate-General.
One Queensland candidate, Lieutenant
Little (Nationalist), is blind and crippled
through wounds received at the war. Inci-
dentally, a number of others are blind and
crippled, though they didn’t go to the war.
G. H. C. Meyer, an old identity of
Adelaide, came from Hanover in his early
days, and on his recent death an ancient will
was found to leave, after a lot of bequests
to Adelaide charities and to Australian
friends and relatives, the residue to people
in Ilunland. Of course they won’t get it
while the war is on; what happens when
international law is restored remains to be
seen.
A dreadful thing has happened. There
are two episcopal aprons in Gippsland—one
the Anglican Bishop of Gippsland’s; the other
the R.G. Bishop of Sale's. Now, a local
Anglican flock, having decided to replace its
old wooden temple by one of brick, called
in “Gippsland” to lay the foundation stone;
and it wasn’t till it was all over that some-
body noticed that, according ,tp the inscrip-
tion, the job was done by' the Carthlic
potentate —the Bishop of Sale.,
Major W. A. D. Smith, of Molong (N.S.W.),
who has got the D.S.O. after good service in
Gallipoli, Egypt and the Holy Land, is a
son of Wallace Smith, who was the fifth
son of John Smith, M.L.C., who married
(September 12, 1842) Mary, eldest daughter
of “Parson” Tom, one of the earliest Metho-
dist local preachers out West. John Smith,
Cornishman, gave all his sons fancy names —
Fergus Ja'go (M.L.C.), Lancelot Noel,
Edwin Ambrose, Claudius, and Wallace
Arabin. The eldest of his daughters married
the late Justice Innes.
Captain Burkett, the Victorian recruiting
spruiker, has a bright young brother, Lieut.
T. Burkett, in John Bull’s Flying Corps. The
lad lately won the Military Cross for a
pretty bit of work over the German lines.
Getting cut off from seven companions, he
seemed a safe subject for Frightfulness by
a covey of German machines that rose from
the ground. But young Burkett became
rude, shot down two Huns after skilful
manoeuvring, and though he and his observer
were wounded, managed to sneak his little
’plane back to safety. Burkett was a gunner
in Gallipoli and France before be developed
a fancy for a higher existence.
“Centurion” : While the Horse regi-
ments were on Gallipoli, their nags in Egypt
were looked after by native syfes, bossed by
“Old Ali,” head jemadar, ex-Soudamesh
N.C.0., who had served with Hicks Pasha
and Gordon, and later with Kitchener. Ali
was an expert at the diagnosis of malinger-
ing, of which there was more than plenty.
The Walers were fat as butter and fresh,
and there were some casualties; and Ali
seemed to separate them from the frauds
mainly with a vast rhinoceros-hide koorbash.
Three were paraded before me one morning.
“Well, Ali,” I said, “what do you think’s up
with this lot?” Ali spat. “All damn right,
sah. Only Mahomet he musquash [no good],
Achmet he magnoon [idiot], and Abdul, this
one, he fool.”
“0.K.”: Speculation as to the origin of
the popular cockneyism, “I don’t think,”
brings one up against the fact that “rotten”
is a very ancient term of abuse. Every
pedantic person within the past 40 years
has railed at the inanity of such as spoke of
“a rotten day” or “rotten luck”; and no
university professor has failed to gird at the
slangy creatures who describe most things
and conditions of life as “rotten.” Yet the
modern vulgarian rarely stretches the mean-
ing of the word as far as Shakspeare did.
And the Immortal Bard didn’t use “rotten”
as a mere colloquialism. He put into a
sonnet: —
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
.And matte me travel forth without my cloak
;r Bo let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,
Hiding thy bravery in. their rotten smoke?
That’s Immortal William singing to the sun,
if you please! I’m not yet On the track of
“blooming,” but I have a notion that Noah
often referred to the Flood as that sort of
nuisance.
“Narroc” : A while before the war I was
travelling to the Fog on a famous liner,
whose skippah was the snobbiest of his
breed. Two of the passengers, one an old
squatter and .the other a quiet sort named
Smith] got more than their fair share of
insults from the captain. When we arrived
at Gib. the naval bosses signalled the ship
to stop, as they were sending a launch out.
The skippah was dashed annoyed, at the
impertinence and was going to find out who
ordered the outrage. Smith quietly re-
marked : “I did, Captain.” “You, Mr.
Smith! You!” snorted the captain. “And
who are you to give such orders?” By this
time the launch had arrived and the officer
in charge showed profound respect to Smith,
who with the old squatter was preparing
to go ashore. They kept the blessed liner
waiting nearly three hours before they re-
turned. Then someone got a tip from one
of the launch’s crew that “Smith” was
Prince Louis of Battenberg.
A varied citizen passed out in Tassy a
-few , days ago. Lewis P. Collins was a
native of England, and was apprenticed to
a surveyor in London. Next he appeared
in Tasmania and did some farming on the
North-West Coast. Then he managed the
Launceston Examiner’s branch office at
Burnie. From there he moved to Launces-
ton, and had a spell as sub-editor of the
Examiner. Turning from the Inky Way,
Collins entered the debt-collecting business,
joined Tinning Bros, and took over the
Launceston branch of the Tasmanian Trade
Protective Institute. Later on he founded
Collins’s Mercantile Association, and pre-
pared such an intelligent system that ; the
defaulter had very little chance. In spare
time, Collins was a bowler, many years secre-
tary of the Launceston Bowling Club, prac-
tically the founder of the Tasmanian Bowl-
ing Association and its first secretary. He
was 61 when the clock stopped. A few
months ago his second son. Vivian, after
passing through Duntroon, was killed within
a brief day or two of his arrival in France.

Pen of Mine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PEX of mine, pen of mine,
I will give you ink for wine
And white paper for your play
All a merry, windy day,
When pond waters come lip-lapping
On the grass
And the little leaves are tapping
On the window as they pass.
I will give you ink for wine
Till you dream a fancy fine,
Ben of mine, pen of mine!
Pen of mine, the world js grey,
Making dead men all the day,
Stamping sorrow in the clay ;
And a bitter chorus runs
From the muzzles of the guns—
Death is early, death is late!
In his garments of black hate
Running youth and beauty after,
llow he slays the mirth and laughter
Of the day!
Let us play,
Pen of mine.
1 will give you ink for wine
Till your starry fancies shine
With the lilt in every ray.
Pen of mine, peri of mine,
We’ll go gipsyipg again
Over lands and blowing brine
To our castles in old Spain,
To the places that we know
Where the yellow lilies grow,
And the little lutorStrings quiver
To the dimples of the river,
While the old delicious note
Pulses from the whitest throat
All the night till morning-shine.
Pen of mine, pen of mine,
There is laughter in the wine !
Pen of mine, the days return ;
Happier suns are still to burn.
Of our years the (latest comer
Shall bring back the first white summer.
Shrill your pipes forever, Pan,
As when pinkest dryads ran
Blowing kisses red and rude
To the satyrs in-the wood
And the frolic thought went free
Laughing over A ready.
Pen of mine, pen of mine,
Drown the Gadarean swine!
Pen of mine, the Spanish Main
Sees the silver ships in train.
Fare we forth from Bristol town,
Bold to take and bold to drown.
Swings old time upon its hinge—•
Philip’s beard is good to singe;
Drake will answer to his drum
Where they serve the reddest rum.
Westward ho ! and eastward ho !
Kiss me thrice before we go !
Homeward bound ! The Asian air
Tingles to the spices rare.
We shall find an Arab tent
Wider than a continent
Till, with all our canvas free.
We round the bend of memory,
Seeking with our jolly crew
That first music laughter blew.
Blow, Pan, blow! And here’s the Devil
Come hot-foot to grace the revel
With the clown and pantaloon
And elfin dances ’neath the moon,
Orpheus and the muses nine
And Venus smiling from the brine,
With Prester John and Paul and Peter
And Rosamund, with Hal to greet her,
And jolly friar and modern ranter
And Quilp and Punch and Tam O’Shanter—
Blow high, blow low!
The world shall go
To the mad dance it used to know!
For pen of mine, pen of mine,
There’s wine in ink and ink in wine.

Trouble.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
METCALFE knew there would be
trouble: there always was when
Harrison was absent. The premo-
nition was born at San Jos6 railhead
when Harrison turned in his tracks and
went back to Buenos Aires, obediently to the
Chief’s laconic telegram. It grew with the
inexplicable death of two pack mules and
the desertion of three peones two nights ago.
Bad luck, bad luck!
He stood at the flap of his tent,' the dark
foreboding beside him and all about him the
Argentine night. Velvet-thick, black; a
swooning dust of tangible stars six inches
from a man’s head; the sullen glow of
Santa Maria’s lights a mile away, and to the
right Challis’s tent and the bundle of rags
and sticks that was the habitat of the
peones. And sand —and more sand.
Over the windless waste of hellish heat
and sand the new line to Neuquen was
to run, tying up that prosperous centre with
San Jose, taking the Uriburi estancias and
the Schofield group on its way. It would
carry much profitable freight, this new line,
over this waste of sand. Sand in the central
pin socket of the only theodolite, sand in his
ears and eyes and hair; sand surely by now,
he thought, in his immortal soul —red sand
that would find for itself a way within the
shell of an unlaid egg. Damn the place and
the job and the railway! Damn the lot!
Young Challis was the best chainman in
the service—quick and eager; good head-
piece ; strong as a horse; work from dawn
to dark in 120 deg., and do it for months
laughing. A qualified assistant-engineer, he
followed Metcalfe into the interior- —all be-
cause of a row one night down by the Boca, at
a dirty cinema show of which Challis had ex-
pressed his opinion rather freely in bad
Spanish, having dined also rather freely. The
sudden Spanish knife had shone for a second
in the moonlit side street and buried its
gleam in Challis’s shoulder. Metcalfe, who
had not dined freely "and who spoke better
Spanish, got out of a passing cab, and in a
few words and in a few moments had emp-
tied the street., lie took Challis to his rooms
and dressed the superficial wound —and
talked. And at the end of his talk Challis,
a lonely boy, under a five years’ contract
with the Railway hopefully signed in Lon-
don and bitterly repented in Buenos Aires,
would have walked barefoot into Hell at
Metcalfe’s nod.
The qualities that make the successful
engineer on “interior preliminaries” are an
unusual possession; the combination of all
of them is miraculous. A man must be of a
gay courage, ready and quick on his feet in
incredible emergencies. He should work
urbanely and courteously, with violent death
o:a both sides; he must know his business,
that no hint of uncertainty reach the rank
and file ; and he must work hard that no pos-
sibility of their working less hard enter
their minds. Above all, he should have the
trick of popularity, of the regard of his fel-
lows, above and below and on his own level,
white and black and mixed.
Most of these qualities Challis had in good
nieasure, added to buoyant youth ; and Met-
calfe was glad to have him with the camp—-
very glad. He filled a place in Metcalfe's
mind (in his heart, if you like) that should
have been otherwise filled ten years agone.
If a man wander the waste places and there-
in build, no fireside is his, no quiet beloved
voices, no e-rowing minds to watch.
When the expedition reached Santa Maria,
a dirty little half-baked desert town, with
the usual Spanish distractions to offer, Chal-
lis in buoyant youth had “subbed” twenty-
five dollars and leave of absence for the
evening. The Head Office rule forbidding
“subs” was religiously and consistently
broken on every expedition whenever a town
or a village or a collection of huts was
sighted; it was a rule quite impossible to
keep, Metcalfe knew —quite impossible. If
leave and “sub” were refused, the men bor-
rowed from the peones and took French
leave, the morale of the camp disappearing
automatically.
The leave was given very reluctantly, but
without comment. Metcalfe was not a fool
-—he knew how far he could go even in the
boots of the “engineer-in-command,” and he
knew very well that any “advich” would
defeat its object.
Challis became drunk, of course; that was
to be expected. Men in buoyant youth do
not endure the hardships of an Argentine
“preliminary” without looking gluttonously
on the rare fleshpot. He came stumbling
and singing over the sand at break of dawn,
with a long fumbling, rambling story of a
woman and a dinner and sundry auventures,
more or less creditable, and all apparently
humorous. The cream of the joke, he con-
fided to Metcalfe, was that the lady was the
Mayor’s wife, and that the Mayor had per-
sonally interrupted the (more or less credit-
able) adventures.
Metcalfe grabbed Challis and steadied him
past the peones' camp into his tent; ripped
off his collar and coat and threw him on to
tlie stretcher; went back to his own tent re-
solved that no “back-sight” or “fore-sight,”
no “rise” or “fall” should keep the camp
long by Santa Maria, lie had rushed through
the absolutely necessary work, and now all
was in readiness to strike camp at crack of
day—they would push on with all possible
speed, he tnought; and the dark foreboding
turned and looked at him again.
The heavy night shimmered and burned
about him; the horrible stars leaned on his
skull with intolerable weight. The place
was pregnant with menace, throbbing with
some evil buried here with an Aztec sinner
long agm Santa Maria winked and leered
dully across the mile of sand; the peones
chattered and quarrelled over some idiotic
card game. Challis still slept the deep sleep
of the tired riotous, and the night boiled and
stifled about the camp, like a hot wet hand
about a man’s windpipe.
Metcalfe cursed the place and the job
again roundly, as he turned back to his
tripod table and maps. Better chuck it up
altogether after this job was done, he
thought. He v r as getting old or had the
wrong temperament —had lost his nerve, or
something. Sick of it, sick
A cry shuddered up into the night, tear-
ing its way in agony through the stars,
leaping, leaping upward, and fell silent in a
sudden strangled gasp. The unmistakable
last call!
On his feet instantly, Metcalfe grabbed
the first weapon to hand, a short hide-whip,
and in a moment was at the other tent.
“Challis! Challis!”
No word from Challis. No words any
more from Challis.
He stumbled across the tent, bumping the
pole, and found the stretcher and the prone
figure—felt the warm blood on the boy’s
mouth and on his shirt; the bright lad; the
bright, strong lad.
The camp was silent now. The chattering
voices at the back had ceased ; but no man
came to help—the peon does not interfere in
an affair of the knife. A swishing, whisper-
ing sound came to Metcalfe’s ears, as of
someone running desperately in the loose,
clogging sand. He caught the man half-way
to Santa Maria, wrenched the lifted knife
out of his hand and thrashed him. whipped
him, scourged him into Santa Maria ; threw
him into gaol there, a tangled mass of dust
and blood and sand, half-naked and weeping
bitterly. Metcalfe registered a charge of
murder, and went back to the camp, disposed
his “evidence” as reverently as he could, and
watched beside it until the dawn broke.
“I will make it my personal duty, Seiior, to
see that the matter is examined very closely.
I regret it —regret it very much—indeed.
Such events—crimes of this nature —are of
very rare occurrence in Santa Maria. We
are peaceable, Sefior Ingles, peaceable and
law-abiding.”
Thus the magistrate in his room, very cold
and calm, with the strange, still indifference
of the Spaniard in authority. ..Metcalfe
could see that there was not much hope.
(Continued on next page.)


DO YOU LOOK SO WELL AS YOU ONCE DID?
Do you look so well as you once did ? Do you feel so well ? If not, have you sus-
pected your kidneys as the cause ?
The uric acid and poisonous matters kept back in the system by disordered kidneys
soon tell on the looks—soon age the suffererthe skin becomes sallow, the eyes lose
their lustre and become bloated, the cheeks are sunken. The disposition, too, is quickly
affected by kidney poisons ; the sufferer grows moody, listless, irritable, feels in every-
body’s way, and can’t be cheered.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills succeed in all cases of Kidney and Bladder trouble
because they are a true kidney medicine —they don’t act on the bowels, but give all their
healing powers to the kidneys, helping them in their great blood-purifying work. Doan’s
Pills begin at once to strengthen and fpne up the tired kidney membranes, and help the
kidneys to drive out the clogging kidney poisons that cause aching back and pains in the
loins, urinary troubles and gravel, nervousness, dizzy spells and heart trouble, dropsy,
and the fatal Bright’s disease. Our neighbors’ word, given here, is good proof of how
truly the genuine Doan’s Backache KidneTy Pills will help the sufferer.
A WOMAN’S CASF.
Mrs. E. L. Wood, IS Abercrombie Street.
Redfern, Sydney, says:—“As the result of
my kidneys being out of order, I suffered a
lot from backache, and at times was in such
pain that I could hardly move. If I stooped
the agony was almost unbearable, and it was
as much as I could do to stand up straight
again without assistance. Backache is a most
trying ailment, the pain never seems to leave
you day or night; at any rate, that was my
experience. After using all kinds of medi-
cines without deriving any benefit I saw
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised,
and the thought occurred to me to try them.
I got a bottle at once, and by the time I
had finished it I felt ever so much better.
Thus encouraged, I continued taking the
pills, with the result that four bottles cured
me completely. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and recom-
mend them to other sufferers with every con-
fidence.”
Proof
for
Sydney
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Henry Adams, 44 Edith Street, St.
Peters, Sydney, says :—“For a long time I
suffered from pains in my back. I got little
rest at night and would toss and turn for
hours. I began using Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills and they gave me relief almost
at once, and a course of the remedy com-
pletely banished the pain. They have proved
a marvellous medicine, for it is eighteen
months since they cured me, and I have
ever suffered with my back since. I am
glad to tell others what Doan’s Backache
Aidney Pills have done for me.”
Nine years later Mrs. Adams confirms the
above and says“My husband's cure has
proved permanent. He has had no return of
backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured him, nearly eleven years ago. He
always keeps a bottle in the house, and takes
a dose now and then ; for he thinks the kid-
neys need a tonic sometimes.”

“However, I will see that all the evidence
is collected and that every effort is made to
find the offender. As for that poor cabaUero
the senor so maltreated last night, inno-
cently and in good faith, I know” —he bowed
—“it is incredible, impossible, that he could
be the guilty person. The man is my own
cousin.”
Metcalfe looked up suddenly, but the
magistrate still stared coldly at his fingers
drumming on the table.
“It appears that he was returning from a
visit to some friends”
“Some friends in the Argentine desert,
Senor?” interrupted Metcalfe bitterly.
“I believe so, Senor,” said the magistrate
with a cold disregard of Metcalfe’s obvious
meaning. He rose.
“A full report shall be furnished to the
Senor on his return, if unhappily the crimi-
nal is not discovered by then,, or to the
Ferro-Carril in Buenos Aires, or to any other
authority whom the Senor shall name.”
He walked to the door and held it open
f-.i Metcalfe. Very suave and bland, but
with sinister, implacable eyes, he said :
“I am the Mayor of this town, Senor, and
I know all my people well. I regret this sad
event very deeply: but I fear that our search
will be unsuccessful.”
Metcalfe gave in. He had talked until he
was sick and silly in a vain attempt to break
this wall of indifference, only to find that
this bleak stone of a man, this sole authority
in Santa Maria, was the sinned-against of
the night before last!
He went back hopelessly to bis waiting
camp, buried his dead with a wooden cross
at the head (which would disappear when
the north winds came), struck camp, and
went on into the interior, following that sad
vanguard Destiny.
Metcalfe told me the story at the
Strangers’ Club one boiling day in Decem-
ber.
“How did you manage without a chain-
man V” I asked.
“I found a drunk Irishman in Santa
Maria, a sodden vestige of a chap,” he said.
“And I hauled him into camp with me. How
he got stranded in that hole, God knows! He
was quick and clever enough when the booze
was sweated out of him.”
He threw his cigar-butt into his cup.
“Incidentally, he was blind sober for five
months ; and that hadn't befallen him in 20
years.”
“I suppose there was a hell of a row when
you got back to Buenos Aires,” I said.
“Oh, yes, all that,” he said grimly. “Old
Wilson went raving mad. of course —cursed
me, body, soul and breeches. Not that that
mattered much !”
His voice trailed down drearily to a note
of pain.
“I Avent to see the boy’s mother in Chelsea
on my next leave,” he said. “That mattered
a good deal.”
HILARY LOFTING.
Confessions of an Untoothed
Shark.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JACK WATERS moved away from the
crowd under my office verandah and
came across the road towards me. He
had red cheeks, white whiskers and blue eyes,
and was kn®wn in Tauwhata as Union Jack.
Jack was bursting with news. He always
did know the latest.
Ellison, manager of the Southern Stock
and Produce Company, was in trouble and
things were serious. After the big dealing
sale at Maori Flat a large collection of notes,
cash and cheques had been placed in the com-
pany’s safe, of which Ellison alone had the
key. When the safe was opened in the morn-
ing it was empty. The company’s auditor
was up to investigate, and Ellison was sus-
pended.
Stories came thick and fast during the
morning: Ellison had bolted; Mrs. Ellison
had left him after a terrible scene; Mrs.
Ellison’s father had been seen motoring
away with the children; Ellison had shot
himself, and Doctor Badger was up there
now.
I felt annoyed with Ellison. He was a
cheery, likable chap. His wife was well off,
and I could not understand it. Anything of
this sort was not good for me, either. I did
not like suspicions being aroused about any-
body who was apparently in a sound posi-
tion. It was the end of the month, too,
and the mail was depressing. There was a
multitude of accounts and odds and ends,
and a peremptory demand from a finance
company for some (jocpmtmts. I looked at
the heap gloomily f when a knock at my door
startled me. It was Ellison.
His story was very concise. He said flatly
that he had nothing to do with the missing
money, and had no idea where it was. No
one else had a key to the safe, and his only
explanation was that someone had picked
the lock. What puzzled him was that the
safe was secure when he went to open it in
the morning.
We walked over to the Imperial Boarding-
house (known as the Mafeking Arms before
Tauwhata carried prohibition), and had a
drink. Under my cross-examination he
simply got irritated. I came to believe that
he really nothing. The mystery was
genuine.
In the morning I had to appear for Joe
Burrows, #who was being prosecuted for lay-
ing the odds. He had been the recognised
bookmaker in Tauwhata for years, and every-
one was in the habit of his billiard-
room to see the latest results from every-
where, which always showed on the pool-
slate. However, a pertinacious wowser cor-
respondent to the local paper had made
things too warm, and an information had to
be laid.
As both J's.P. on the bench were, in Joe’s
words, "on the sheet for a middling dollop,”
he hoped to get off with a £2O fine. lie had
also spent a tenner on what he called “bread
on the water,” and felt fairly sure, of a light
report from the sergeant. His optimism
proved to be well grounded. Aftef I had
addressed the Bench to the effect that this
betting transaction was obviously an isolated
one, and that it was well known thajt the
citizens of Tauwhata would not be parties in
general to such a surreptitious breaking of
the law, the Bench fined Joe £lO and Warned
him not to repeat the offence. He cattle
back to the office to settle with me. He was
full of surprises, but he outdid his previous-
best effort when he remarked casually across
the table while I was writing the receipt:
“I wuz talkin’ this mornin’ to the kewpie
that ’ooked the Produce Company’s dough.”
“Good God!” I said,. “Then it wasn’t
Ellison?”
“That poor mug!” snorted Joe. “He
couldn’t barber a deener. He’s only fit ter
mind goldfish.”
I thought I saw a chance to earn hand-
some costs and do a turn for a good fellow
at the same time. I explained Ellison’s fine
points to Joe at length, and entreated him
to see if anything could be done.
Joe listened solemnly to my eloquence,
commented thoughtfully on my being such
“a strong gee” for Ellison, and promised to
see his cobber.
While mixing my evening spot that night
the doorbell rang, and Joe came in with' a
redheaded youth whom he introduced as Bill
Wheeler.
Joe had wrestled to some purpose with his
friend, for Bill, after carefully looking me
over with a pair of small, sharp, grey eyes,
explained his modus operandi without more
ado. He had simply gone to Ellison’s house
and picked the pockets of the trousers that
were hanging on the bed. Then he had
slipped down to the office, gone through the
safe, and, returning to Ellison’s house, had
put the keys back in the trousers pockets.
Ellison slept soundly throughout, and Mrs.
Ellison, said Bill, was “a cow to snore.”
Bill had one yellow tooth at the top, and
it showed momentarily when his smile of
pride slipped on.
In face of a nerve as wonderful as this I
had some difficulty in putting my proposition
for restitution. However, Bill was a busi-
ness man only. “What’s it worth?” he
asked.
“That’s all very well,” I said, “but can I
he sure that you will get Ellison out of it?”
Bill nodded, and Joe Burrows asserted that
I could bank on it. “Stone blanky ginger
Bill is,” he said.
Bill named his price, and I said I would
pay Joe, wnom I asked to stay behind.
When we were alone, Joe, with that cheer-
ful recognition of my methods which
annoyed me sometimes, said :
“I suppose there’ll he room for you and
me in this somewhere between Bill and
Ellison ?”
I agreed that there might, and kept at my
point about Bill’s reliability.
Joe was sure that Bill was all right. “He’s
a bloke of class, Bill is.” lie said, "lie isn’t
one of these scrap-uv-paper blokes.”
I rang up Ellison, and he came down.
He decided to “give it a go,” and arranged to
pay the amount I mentioned. I allowed
ample room for myself and Joe; but once
Ellison’s mind was made up he was not
difficult over the matter of price. Besides,
his position was perilous. The auditor was
an officious sort, and had made the tour ot
the town to find out how much Ellison owed.
He was notoriously careless in the matter of
his trade accounts, owing to his wife being
so well off, and the auditor was in high glee
at the long list he had gathered. So Ellison
was very tractable.
Next morning I had another visit from
Joe Burrows. Bill, it appeared, wanted it
made quite clear that his - copyright method
of burglary was not to be disclosed or men-
tioned in any way. He had seen a city 1).
in Tauwhata, and would have to “make a
getaway” at once.
I gave the necessary assurance, and Joe
said: “Well. Bill’s done it. 1 told you he
wuz right, didn’t I? W’y, Bill’s as honest
as you or me.”
I looked hard at Joe for a moment, but
his face was quite expressionless.
Ellison was round quite soon, in high glee
and choking with laughter.'
The contents of the safe had gone again!
They had been found, carefully put in a box
along with the proceeds of the original rob-
bery, wrapped up in the auditor’s brown
hat! The sergeant had discovered them this
morning, resting on' the steps of the police
lock-up.
The auditor was in a fearful state. He
had fitted up a new lock on the safe at
great expense, and was the only person who
had a key.
It was not long before Ellison was re-
instated. and we heard that the official
explanation was that Someone had made
copies of the keys.
Joe Burrows, when we were dividing the
profits some days later, said:
“That, there brown ’at was a good touch
of Bill’s. Fer a ’armless, good-’earted little
cove like Bill is ’e’s a real Keystone when
he tries.”

“Indispensable”
—a word largely used in these days—may be said to accurately express,
in so far as any single word can, what is the careful and considered
conclusion which has been arrived at by many people who use
Beeeham’s Pills. They consider that Beeeham’s Pills are “indispen-
sable” to their health, and, as a matter of course, to their happiness;
and they never allow themselves to be without a supply of this valuable
medicine in their homes. This latter is an excellent idea, and one
worthy of imitation—for there is no doubt whatever, that, as a preven-
tive medicine—one that may be taken with confidence when perhaps
only an “out of sorts ” feeling is experienced and before any definite
ailment has developed—Beecham’s Pills are a positive boon. They do
good all round;—they tone up the stomach, correct the action of the
liver, regulate the bowels and are a powerful agent in purifying the
blood. It is certainly a good plan never to be without
