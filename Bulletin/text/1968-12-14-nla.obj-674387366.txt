TALKING OF THE SAD
NEWS WITH MENZIES'
MAGNIFICENT LADIES
YOU MUST have heard the regret-
table news. Menzies Hotel closes after
Christmas, the auction takes place on
March 10, and the wrecker gains pos-
session in April. The auction catalogue
is beautiful, with over 100 pages of
illustrations, plus a cover in Menzies’
tartan, Hunting Tartan, naturally. There
are over 3000 items and it will be the
biggest auction ever seen in this town.
The auctioneers plan to do it in the
Chandelier Room and the show will run
for five days. There will be seats for
800 and 25 TV sets spread around the
room. You see, it will be a closed-
circuit TV show and the camera will
start on the sixth floor and work down.
Meanwhile business is still brisk at
Menzies, waiters still rushing hither
and yon in their tartan jackets. This
week your correspondent went there to
discuss the matter with two old friends,
Prudence and Phoebe. They are
magnificent ladies: proud, topless,
bronze, and full-breasted, they hold up
lights on either side of the landing.
Self: It’s on. They’re closing the
place after Christmas.
Prudence: They must be mad. Every-
body knows this is the finest hotel in
the colonies. The “Argus” said so when
we rebuilt in 1867.
Phoebe: Yes, I’ve always remembered
the beautiful line the nice “Argus” boy
used —“Unique, but by no means
outre.”
Prudence: Yes, two billiard-rooms,
eight private sitting-rooms, a music-
room, a drawing-room, and a bathroom
on every bedroom floor. That killed
’em, didn’t it, Phoebe?
Phoebe: Did it ever. And all done
for that charming Prince Alfred, Duke
of Edinburgh, such a good-looking boy
with beautiful brown side-whiskers. We
had special gas illuminations out for
him. I can see them now, the huge
letters A.E.A. for Alfred Earnest Albert,
and flaming stars. Such • tone his visit
gave us. ■« •'
Prudence: Tone, my eye. I have it
on very good authority that apart from
coming here he paid visits to Sarah
Fraser’s estarninet in Stephen Street, a
house of ill-fame, no less. When he
left here she even followed him up to
Sydney.
Phoebe: Hush, Prudence. Can’t you
be rpore discreet. This man’s from the
Sydney “Bulletin.” You know what
that publication’s like. No sense of pro-
priety. It’ll be published everywhere.
Prudence: See if I care. If they’re
pulling the place down this man should
know all.
Phoebe: Well, you should give him
the correct facts. The place was put up
by David Mitchell, a most competent
gentleman; he did most of the big ones
like the Exhibition Building.
Prudence: Ah, yes, he used to have a
daughter who sang a bit. What was
her name?
Phoebe: Nellie.
Prudence: That’s right. She was
expelled from PLC for . . .
Phoebe: Be quiet. That has nothing
to do with our story. Then in 1896
we added two floors.
Prudence: Yes, they had built that
flash Federal Coffee Palace down the
road, biggest temperance house the
world had ever seen. Everybody had
to come to good old Menzies to get a
drink. Business was fantastic.
Phoebe: As I was saying when I was
interrupted, at this stage we put electric
bells in every room and we created
history by providing electric curling
tongs. I shall quote to you a line or
two from our 1906 brochure: “The
suites are exquisitely toned to satisfy
the most fastidious. The reading-room
is hand-painted with the ferns and flora
of Australia and fitted with double
carpets, red velvet divans, heavy silk
portieres, and tables covered with dark
red tapestry interwoven with broad gold
ornamentation.” Young man, I assure
you that we set the pace.
Self: I understand that you always
attracted a very nice type of person.
Phoebe: Naturally. After all, we did
have the band on Saturday nights. The
squatting families always came “en
suite,” don’t you know, with at least
one personal maid, the children’s
governess, and usually a valet. Evening
dress was always worn at dinner.
Nobody would dream of wearing any-
thing else.
Prudence: Not like some of these
little bits that have been in here for
the Cup this year. Archibald Menzies
wouldn’t have stood for it. Did you
see them, Phoebe? Naked, utterly
naked, from the thighs down. And
“Typical! The only decent topless
show in town and they’re gonna
close it!”

Glass: makes outdoor living a year-round pleasure.
Around your pool or outdoor living
area, a beautiful screen of glass keeps
out the wind but lets the sun come
through.
Somedays a breeze can be annoying.
Glass will stop it. Glass is the perfect
windbreak; the ideal sun trap.
A sheltered pool adds weeks to your
swimming season. When winds keep
neighbours from their pools on other-
wise fine, sunny days your family will
still be enjoying your pool.
Clear glass outdoor walls let you
keep your view in sight. Figured glass
guards your privacy. And maintenance
is easy. Just wash it down with a hose
now and then. Simple. Glass won't rot.
Or warp. And you don't have to paint it.
Put up a glass screen wall around
your pool or outdoor living area. It
adds value to your home, comfort to
your leisure time. And if you haven't an
outdoor area now, create one with
glass. It's easy. Glass makes beautiful
sense around your home.
For some bright ideas on how to use
glass in your present home or new one,

Phoebe: I know, I blushed a pale
shade of copper.
Self: You must have had some
awfully important people here.
Phoebe: Oh, everybody really. Where
else would they stay? We have had
Alexander Graham Bell, Herbert
Hoover, Mitchell’s daughter, Pader-
ewski, George Augustus Sala, General
MacArthur, Toti Dal Monte, Fritz
Kreisler, and that good-looking
Richard Nixon. It was nice to see him
get on. And we had Mr. Anthony
Trollope. He said: “I have never put
myselt in a better inn in any pare of
the world.”
Self: Yes, but Paderewski didn’t
say that.
Prudence: He wouldn’t know, a
nasty little Polish man. Mmm, 1904,
wasn’t it? He called over the head-
waiter and demanded: “Tell me, who
is your chef? Is he a chef, is he a
tailor, or is he a carpenter?”
Self: You must have seen a lot of
changes.
Prudence: Most of them for the
worse. There’s a bathroom to every
bedroom. Such nonsense. And they
wonder why the city runs out of
water.
Phoebe: Prudence, you always did
have a nasty tongue. Tell the gentle-
man of the good things we still have.
The drawing-room is still there a
place where gentlemen can retire and
smoke their cigars.
Prudence: And tell their dirty
stories.
Phoebe: Hush, girl. We still have the
Governor’s Entrance at the side. That
used to be the entrance for the
original proprietor, Archibald Menzies,
and his family.
Prudence: The fact is, they called
it the Governor’s Entrance because
H.E. needed a discreet place where
he could come in at the side. Oh, no,
it wasn’t done to be seen walking into
a place where they sold spirituous
liquors.
Phoebe: Prudence, it was always an
honor to be seen coming into Menzies.
Prudence: I suppose so. And now
there’s to be an auction. We’re all to
go under the hammer like a slave
market.
Phoebe: You don’t want to put it that
way. I understand people from all over
the nation are already making requests
for items from Menzies. I don’t know
about you, but I’m sure someone will
bid for me and I’ll go into a very nice
type of home. Why, I hear that one
gentleman has put in a request for a
picture he remembered that was in
his honeymoon suite.
Prudence: Gawd, that’s why Men-
zies is going down. What a honeymoon.
Fancy even being able to remember
seeing a picture.
Phoebe: That remark is just typical
of your vulgarity, how you ever . . .
I rankly, I didn’t like the turn of
conversation and it seemed better to
depart. But please watch this space in
March for further exciting news of
Phoebe and Prudence.

Mr. Milne's Bond 7.
If you pay for freight instead,
you're a sassenach
No fool, William Milne. He knew the cost of shipping
whisky 13,000 miles from home. So he imported himself
instead, all the way to Glen Osmond, S.A. There he set up
the Colony’s first distillery. The very beginning of Bond 7.
Rich. Mild. Malty. Mature. And free from the freight charges
other good whiskies have to bear. Bond 7 is probably
the most popular whisky enjoyed by Caledonians down under.
Because good whisky doesn’t depend upon place of birth, but
on breeding. The breeding? Good grain, rich malt, clear
water, old casks, and time. Bond 7 is the spirit a Scot could
proudly put his name to. And, for that matter, his glass.

THEY COULDN'T
SEE THE DOLLARS
FOR THE TREES
GOING UP in the lift at Farmer’s a
woman is saying how stifling it is, her
nerves are frazzled, she is not terribly
in the mood for tonight. And on the
ninth floor fixes on a social smile and
disgorges with the rest into the old
Blaxland Gallery for the Black and
White Committee’s “Christmas Trees of
the World Exhibition” in aid of the
Royal Blind Society of N.S.W.
It is Nola Dekyvere’s last public
appearance this year as president of
the Black and White Committee. It
is the Blaxland Gallery’s last public
exhibition before conversion to a store-
room. All things considered, it is an
evening that will be remembered; in
some quarters more than others.
So into the melee goes the woman
whose nerves are frazzled and she joins
a couple of hundred others busy calm-
ing theirs with champagne and
savories. The party’s been going half-
an-hour. It is 6.30 p.m. or so, and one
or two of the less loyal guests are
expressing some disappointment as to
what they’ve paid $5 to view: that is,
27 assorted shaped and sized Christmas
trees from foreign parts which are to
be auctioned later on, gift-wrapped
presents, scattered round their bases,
included. Roughly, the disappointment
registered is that everything’s so plastic
and . . . well . . . lacking in grandeur.
At this moment a party of matrons
sitting round a tree munching chicken
sandwiches are saying it’s bliss to rest
their feet, and they wouldn’t half mind
the presents on this tree. Rumor has it
they include a typewriter, Sekers silk,
and something exciting from Harry
Miller. You know, the one who puts on
all that daring theatre, darl. There is a
large fat trad plastic tree from New
York which Jerry Lapin’s yearning for
to fill a large fat gap in his Caprice
Restaurant decorations. And architect
Neville Gruzman has his eye on the
Qantas tree, made by the boys in the
overhaul shop at Mascot Jet base “. . .
from redundant aircraft parts, includ-
ing compressor discs, muzzle guide
vanes, and light beacon.
All the gang is here, including L. J.
Hooker, the property magnate, who is
trying to look inconspicuous; he hates,
he says, the limelight. • And some
Qantas hierarchy, and some Farmer’s
hierarchy, and the Dean of the Diplo-
matic Corps, His Excellency Mr.
Mariano Ezpeleta, a diminutive man
wondering what on earth to say when
he opens the exhibition, he ,had no
idea . . . and a couple who glide in
like leaders of the cool gin set and are
later revealed as Charles Widdy who’s
in menswear in the city and Julie
Bolton who’s in girlswear. Yes, well,

they always dress up to the nines, says
someone.
The hierarchy go forward with Mr.
Ezpeleta. Someone introduces him and
he says “. . . most people pull things
when they open exhibitions, I have
nothing to pull . . .” It is immaterial.
He opens it with suitable Christmassy
thoughts, muffled in places by raucous
guests, and Nola with a burst of clarity
that shatters them all announces that
His Excellency has travelled 200 miles
from Canberra, he is going on tomorrow
to New Zealand, so it is par-
ticularly nice of him to have fitted this
occasion in. Isn’t it? Everyone claps.
And up jumps Geoffrey Gray with a
confident smile to commence the
auction.
It is clear within minutes that though
this may be Christmas and it may be for
charity, it is for charity. Nevertheless, it
is apparent that it is going to take a lot
more than Mr. Gray’s professional skill
as auctioneer up there to extract dollars
easily from those down here. Maybe
people should stand back? So they can
see what trees Mr. Gray is offloading?
Nola and minions move in with deter-
mination. Nola shushes everyone to
keep quiet. Perhaps it was a mistake to
give whisky and gin as well as cham-
pagne “. . . what am I bid for the
Tahiti tree? $100? $5O? $3O? Do I
hear $2O? Free gifts thrown in. They’re
worth $2O alone, oh, come on . . .”
And so on. Slowly, through 27 trees.
Through the noise, which is deafen-
ing, Mr. Gray’s voice can be heard like
a sergeant-major fighting for is honor
. . . Come on, Leslie Walford, what
offer? A centrepiece for your shop? . . .
Robert Shaw? To Robert Shaw, thank
you. The rich Mr. Shaw buys two and
says he’s crucified. Jerry Lapin gets his
tree from Brooklyn and another acci-
dentally, from Germany. Mrs. Lapin
says he must throw that threadbare shirt
away when he gets home. Julie Bolton
gets the Fiji tree . . . Now come on. The
Qantas tree from redundant parts. Mr.
Hooker? Leslie. To Leslie, finally, for
$l5O, and he’s gonna find L. Hooker
and see why he didn’t go on bidding.
Mr. Hooker didn’t bid at all. He was
roped in. Finally, it is all over. Nola
rises and shushes once more into the
microphone. She just wants to say “. . .
you were all terrible. But sweet. To
come. You may like to know Mr. Gray
raised between $l3OO and $l4OO for the
trees.”
Actually, it’s not quite all over.
Spanish music throbs out, last drinks go
down, last sandwiches, top, and through
it all someone is heard telling someone
she is a silly, spoilt girl for unwrapping
all those parcels, she will rewrap them
immediately; and someone is saying she
certainly won’t, she was told she could
undo them. Drops champagne glass at
Nola’s feet. Exits, scrunching, with
shattered companion. This is followed
at 8.30 sharp by “God Save the Queen.”
Going down in the lift the man who
put on the Spanish music said he’d
no idea what it was called. Anyway,
the BBC supplied it and, personally, he
thought it all a bit silly.

On the gentle art of port sipping
There’s a revolution happening in
Europe particularly England
right now. The traditional picture of
a port drinker as a cantankerous old
gouty club dweller is going . . . going
. . . gone. Because the young world
has discovered port. And, what’s
more, the sophisticated young men
and women of Britain have made
Port their favourite drink. It’s not
hard to understand why. And I
believe this will happen here, too,
particularly when there are so many
very good ports available at quite
reasonable prices (our Royal Reserve
Port costs about 80c sometimes
less and is an excellent port.) Why
should you sip a port ? my answer
is that any wine that takes as long to
make as a good port, deserves to be
approached with respect. And sipped
gently and enjoyed to the last sip.
Especially with a dry biscuit before
going to bed.
On the styles of white
table wines.
Notwithstanding the number of dif-
ferent wine brands available, in
Australia we have a wide range of
white table wine types from which to
choose. I would like to quickly enu-
merate them, and briefly describe
the differences so you will have a
better idea of what the names mean
next time you buy a white wine. (Be-
cause I know them best, I have based
these descriptions on the Dalwood
range, but what I say can be broadly
applied to white wines generally).
Dalwood Riesling is light and re-
freshing with a grapey, crisp finish.
Hock is similar, but with a more pro-
nounced bouquet and flavour.
Chablis has a tangy, flinty, character,
while White Burgundy is soft and full
bodied. Other white table wines are
Moselle (like Eden Valley Moselle)
which is light and delicate with a
trace of natural grape sugars, and
Sauterne which is sweeter. If you
like Riesling, you should really try
Minchinbury Rhine Riesling. This is
different to ordinary rieslings,
as it is made from the Rhine
Riesling grape which gives
this wine a pronounced
fruity flavour that places it
in a class of its own.

PONDERING THE IMPROBABLES
Comment by ‘Observer’
IF the Australian Government had
announced last week that within a
decade it planned to spend 10 percent
of GNP on defence and run up an
army of more than 250,000, even those
who disagreed with the decision would
at least have seen our Government as
capable of bold, independent policy.
Yet, last week, Cabinet was still discuss-
ing a “defence review” that has received
a great deal more publicity than it has
received Ministerial attention, and it has
not yet decided what it should say to
Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, and New
Zealand about Australian intentions
after the British leave in 1971.
It was the Government of Singapore,
a nation of less population than Mel-
bourne, that was ’making the decisions
last week, when it announced its inten-
tion of bringing defence expenditure
up to 10 percent of GNP within ten
years, and establishing an army of 45,000
(which is equal to more than 250,000
for Australia if the same proportion
were kept for our population). It was
the Government of Australia that cast
aside the question of the disposition of
one Australian battalion.
It is reported that the Prime Minister
is still delaying matters because he is
pondering imponderables. Since impon-
derables are imponderable, this could
mean that he could go on not making
his mind up for as long as he remains
Prime Minister. To wait for the Paris
peace talks to end might take years.
To wait for further clarification from
the British is to wander in a circle,
since their clarifications wait on ours.
To wait for a talk with President Nixon
is to wait for a talk in which the Ameri-
can President will ask the Australian
Prime Minister what Australia intends
to do. And even if imponderables
became ponderable, some new uncer-
tainty would crop up. To seek certainty
in foreign policy or military planning
is to seek the impossible.
This is not to say that one shouldn’t
try to be as careful as one can. But is
it a fatal risk to say to the governments
of Singapore and Malaysia, who have
asked us to stay on, in their countries
after the British leave, that as far as
we are concerned the British departure
does not end our interest in our own
neighborhood and that we will stay on,
perhaps with certain qualifications, not
for ever, of course, but over a transition
period? There are risks, of course. But
are they as great as the risks of going
at the same time as the British?
To do so would make us look like a
colonialist appendage. It would
weakened, perhaps fatally, our influence
and credibility in the region in which
our comparatively great wealth can
make us a significant power. And to
equivocate in the meantime is to run
the risk of damaging morale in Singa-
pore and Malaysia, of lessening what-
ever interest the British are likely to
show in the area, of lessening, or at
least failing to help maintain,
American interest in South-East Asia,
and of proving ourselves tricky custo-
mers whose trickiness comes not from
guile but from mindlessness.
The question comes back again to
basic questions of how we see ourselves
in the world. Can we go on, being
merely the loyal little ally of some
great power, incapable of significant
independent action? The answer
would seem to be “no,” since America,
the only great power now available to
us, is no longer likely to want such
an association. Is it then back to the
old fortress? In, the sense that we are
not a fortress, nor likely to be, the
answer is again no. But even if we
bristled with military strength, by
turning our back to the future we
would degenerate into various kinds of
crumminess.
If the answer is that we see our-
selves as a prosperous small power in
the world at large and a prosperous
significant power within our own
region, it is not enough to just yammer
away about our increasing involvement
in South-East Asia. Involvements come
from what you put up in the way
of money, military strength, or
propaganda. And they come not from
choice but by circumstance. It is all
very well for Mr. Whitlam, for
instance, to urge involvement in general
terms but to be against military support
for Malaysia and Singapore. This
happens to be the particular involve-
ment that is on the agenda. It is the
involvement we have been asked for.
And—not only in Malaysia and Singa-
pore—-our attitudes to it will be taken
as the test of our sincerity in claiming
a regional role.
THE SHOWDOWN WITH MR. McEWEN
Comment by Alan Reid
THE REBEL FLAG has been hoisted
in the Country Party. Four Country
Party parliamentarians last week were
signatories to a publicised letter which
virtually repudiated the tariff views of
Country Party Leader John McEwen.
The signatories were Senator T. L.
Bull (N.S.W.), Mr. J. Corbett (MHR,
Qld.), Mr. R. S. King (MHR, Vic.),
and Mr. D. W. Maisey (MHR, W.A.).
Signatories with them included a
number of people, such as Mr. T. M.
Saint, president of the Australian
Wheatgrowers’ Federation, and others
whose influence upon McEwen’s bucolic
voters is considerable.
The signatories refused to accept
McEwen’s thesis expressed in the House
of Representatives that the Tariff Board
consisted of a lot of second-raters whose
comparatively low remuneration re-
fleeted their worth, and who ought to
be ignored when they expressed the view
that there would be overall economic
advantage to Australia in having in-
flated tariffs examined, and resources
and manpower steered to lower cost and
in the long-term more productive enter-
prises.
Said the signatories: “As the objective
(of the Tariff Board) is to promote a
better use of the nation’s resources—of
capital and manpower by directing
r . , . , °
them away from areas with the lowest
real productivity and into ventures more
sut'ed to Australian economic realities
the Tariff Boards proposals (to re-
examine the situation of Australian
industries enjoying a more than 50
percent tariff protection) should benefit
all sections of the community except
a small group of highly protected manu-
facturers.”
The -showdown between McEwen and
a section of his Country Party followers
had to come. It has been inevitable ever
since Cabinet agreed after the British
devaluation of sterling in 1967 to
rationalise uneconomic rural industries.
It was impossible for McEwen to main-
tain without challenge from within
his Party a position in which un-
economic rural industries were up for
rationalisation, while possibly un-
economic secondary industries were to
escape scrutiny.
McEwen has avoided a showdown up
to now only because of the shrewdness
with which the Government pro-
grammed tariff debates for a time and
an hour when nobody would give them
real and thorough attention, and the
trust that his followers had in his sound
political judgment and sagacity,
Politically, jobs are an emotive factor
with the voting public. They are not
particularly concerned about esoteric
economic arguments. They do not
understand them. But they do under-
stand that a job means a pay packet in
the worker’s hand each week. If some-
body creates the fear that they will be
without that pay packet each week, they
vote ., °, r th s; man who guarantees
that it will be there on time at knock-
„ . v
off time on Inday.
McEwen can undoubtedly influence
sufficient of the general electorate, with
its ves t e d interest in full employment
and j ts f ears that even a few close
downs of uneconomic industries could
be the forerunner of more to come, to
his viewpoint to ensure an electoral

majority for the Government if his
viewpoint is accepted as the official
viewpoint of the Government.
But his real problem is to sell his
viewpoint to his parliamentary followers
and the mostly rural voters who send
his followers to the Parliament.
The Country Party is traditionally a
free-trade Party. The secondary indus-
tries which enjoy tariff protection in
excess of 50 percent the industries
which the Tariff Board have nominated
for critical examination are just the
industries that primary producers
believe, rightly or wrongly, add to their
costs.
Once this did not matter as the
gap between production costs and
market returns was wide enough to
enable everyone to get a nice slice out
of the national cake. But with the gap
between production costs and market
returns closing, particularly for wool —•
still Australia’s major overseas-currency
earner there is not the same com-
placency.
Only Bull, Corbett, King, and Maisey
of the Country Party parliamentarians
signed the letter repudiating McEwen’s
tariff approach. But there are others
within the Country Party whose mood
is not pleasant, and they could easily
join these four in open rebellion.
Even Deputy Country Party Leader
Doug Anthony has shown himself
publicly as in sympathy with the Bull-
Corbett-King-Maisey outlook. At a
meeting of the Farm Writers and Broad-
casters’ Club in Sydney last year,
Anthony, the guest speaker, was asked,
“How are we going to get people to
realise that the industrial section is
trying to kill rural industries (because
of primary industry’s rising costs)?”
Cutting right across McEwen’s tariff
line, Anthony said, “I don’t think there
is enough awareness . . . this message
. . . just goes right over their heads.”
Country Party Whip Winton Turnbull,
from Victoria, and lan Pettitt, from
N.S.W., have also publicly questioned
the wisdom from the viewpoint of the
primary producer of some McEwen
policies.
Quite considerable bitterness has
been aroused by the Government’s
wheat stabilisation scheme, which,
according to Maisey, threatens not only
to damage the wheat industry long-
term and to reduce wheatgrowers’
returns at a time when their costs are
rising but to raise prices for bread,
eggs, and other basic foodstuffs to the
Australian consumer generally.
This, in turn, has created hostility
to McEwen, who is regarded as the
architect of the new stabilisation scheme
in the Country Party Parliamentary
Party. By speaking only sparsely on
tariffs, McEwen has for a long time
managed to repress the uneasiness
within his own Party. But now it is
out in the open for the world to see.
It is going to be interesting to see
how McEwen, easily the most able
political manoeuvrer in the Country
Party, will handle what is undoubtedly
a serious rebellion in the ranks of his
one-time solid parliamentary group.


One more week
DEVELOPMENT
WHAT is a developed country? That
query comes out of the news that
Ethiopia has been asked to provide
finance to sewer Queensland’s Gold
Coast, and, what is more, is prepared
to put $24,000,000 into the scheme.
Apparently, the matter was first raised
when Emperor Haile Selassie was here
on a State visit.
LOBBY JOB
MRS. JONES is coming to Canberra.
That is the word as a new $25,000
lobby job for “a consortium of
several major Australian public com-
panies” is being hawked round.
Mrs. Jon.es was the central character
in Marrickville Margarine’s massive
public-relations effort during 1966 to
get quota restrictions removed. The
campaign, on which $1,250,000 was
spent, was a great failure. Margarine
manufacturers simply gave up and
went quiet for a while. Now they are
moving back into the lobbying business
in a new way. They are refurbishing
the defunct National Margarine Manu-
facturers’ Association, seeking an execu-
tive director, and offering up to
$25,000 plus perks.
The margarine interests have gone
to remarkable lengths to put a veil of
secrecy round the search for a lobbyist.
Even applicants — there are said to
have been 250 of them so far — are
not being told who their potential
employers are. They have been, given a
roneod screed which says: “Any leak-
age would quickly get to the Press and
premature publicity could be harmful.”
The sponsors of the new PR cam-
paign are Marrickville Holdings and
Unilever, with the advertising agency
Hansen Rubensohn also involved. Evi-
dently they fear that the abortive
efforts of Mrs. Jones and the fierce
personal attacks on N.S.W. Premier
Askin which were made by Marrick-
ville Margarine during the previous
campaign will deter candidates.
The screed being given to potential
executive directors of the new mar-
garine lobby group makes it clear that
the $25,000 man will have the job of
taking over where Mrs. Jones was laid
off. “There is certain existing legis-
lation which must eventually be
CENTRAL ISSUE
THE LITERARY CONTROVERSY
of the past few weeks has been who
is or who isn’t an Australian; this
battle has been waged between Mr.
Patrick White (born London, arrived
here at the age of six months) and
Mr. Douglas Stewart (born New Zea-
land, arrived here at the age of six
Mr. B. M. Snedden, MP...a more
important question
months) following the award of the
Britannica Award of $lO,OOO to Mr.
Stewart.
A much more important question
which might have been occupying the
literary world at this time is whether
Communists are eligible for grants from
the Com'monwealth Literary Fund. This
came into question when the Leader
of the Opposition, Mr. Whitlam, who
is a member of the grants committee,
declared when opening the Professional
Musicians’ Annual Conference in Can-
berra last month that the fund was
“precluded from making grants to
people who were or had been Com-
munists.” This was followed by cryptic
letters to the editor from the Society
of Authors and the Fellowship of
Writers.
It is now clear that who everyone
had in mind was Mr. Frank Hardy,
back a week or so ago from a 3J-month
trip to Russia, Czechoslovakia, Britain,
and the United States. Mr. Hardy
applied for a grant this year, the first
time he has done so. He wished to
write a novel on the dilemma of his
generation of Communists, to be set in
Sydney, Moscow, and Prague.
Mr. Hardy, the author of the noted
“Power Without Glory” and whose “The
Unlucky Australians” was published
last year, says he applied “because he
needed the money to buy time.” He
assures us that without financial help
it will now be impossible to give the
book the undivided attention essential
to create a long novel.
We believe that the advisory board
of the Com'monwealth Literary Fund
recommended that Mr. Hardy get a
six-month grant of $3OOO. The advisory
board of the Fund comprises Sir
Grenfell Price (chairman), Professor
Inglis Moore, Mr. Ken Slessor, Mr.
Douglas Stewart, Miss Kylie Tennant,
and Mr. Geoffrey Blainey. The board
puts its recommendations for grants and
other matters to the Fund committee,
which consists of Mr. B. M. Snedden,
representing the Prime Minister, Mr.
Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition,
and Mr. Philip Lucock, who has repre-
sented the Country Party on the com-
mittee for some years.
The advisory board’s recommenda-
tion on Mr. Hardy was turned down
by the Fund committee, which has the
sole say on who should or should not
get grants. Mr. Whitlam’s remark at
the Professional Musicians’ Conference
must fairly obviously be based on his
idea of what happened at the meeting
of the Fund committee and the advi-
sory board: that one of the committee
made it clear that his objection to
Mr. Hardy was because of his member-
ship of the Communist Party. He may
even have suggested that there is a
“rule” against giving grants to Com-
munists or ex-Communists.
Mr. Lucock is the veteran of many
discussions on grants to writers. That
leaves only Mr. Snedden who has only
this year deputised for the Prime
Minister, Mr Gorton.
It is- hardly likely that this attitude
is to be Mr. Snedden’s basic contri-
bution to the workings of the Common-
wealth Literary Fund. It seems more
likely that he had done his homework
imperfectly. In 1962 there was a fuss
over the exclusion of the Left-wing
magazine “Overland” from the list of
subsidised magazines. “Overland”
received a special subsidy in 1963 and
has received one since; at present it is
$625.
An earlier incident was in 1952
when Miss Kylie Tennant, now a
member of the advisory board, received
a grant. So did noted Melbourne
Communist writer Mr. Judah Waten.
Mr. W. C. Wentworth, MP, protested
in Parliament about “grants to Corn-
munists.” Mr. Wentworth later with-
drew his charges against Miss Tennant,
offered to waive parliamentary privilege
so that she could sue if she wished,
and apologised. Miss Tennant returned
her grant but was persuaded by the
Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,
to accept it.
The Commonwealth Literary Fund
works in, almost complete secrecy. The
original reason for this, which remains,
is that its object, when founded in
1908, was to provide pensions for
writers in need. These, obviously, are
the business only of those who get
them. Also, in general, unsuccessful
applicants for grants may not want to
have their lack of success publicised.
The Society of Authors’ suggestion is
to make the advisory board an execu-
tive board which makes its own
decisions.
On the question of Mr. Hardy, it
may for the moment be charitably
assumed that a mistake was made. If
so, there is every reason for the Fund
to accept the recommendation of its
advisory committee and give the grant
to Mr. Hardy prompty. Time means
money to a writer.


changed,” it says. He will have to
influence the mass media and also do
“Parliamentary lobbying.” “If he hasn’t
already got good political contacts, he
must develop them. He must under-
stand the forces and self-interest which
motivate politicians” the screed
continues.
It hopes to get a man of the stature of
Sir William Gunn of the Wool Board,
so they say. An impressive list of desir-
able qualities is given: “force, judgment,
and dignity” and the “ability to carry
off the role of a public figure while being
a dedicated fighter for his cause.” The
screed sums up: “One way of describing
this man would be to say that he is the
type of man that one of the major politi-
cal parties would choose as an electoral
candidate in a vital seat and mark
down for future Cabinet rank.”
Perhaps the most interesting depar-
ture from the Mrs. Jones campaign is
suggested in the insistence: “He must
deal in facts. The greatest damage to
his cause can come from publishing
or quoting facts which can be proved
to be wrong.”
It appears that the organisers of the
new campaign are learning from the
failure of Mrs. Jones’ campaign because,
as The Bulletin pointed out in several
articles in 1966, the margarine interests
that time published so'me very
inaccurate material in their advertise-
ments. They spoke, for instance, of an
“oilseeds explosion” and described
safflower as a wonder crop. In fact,
it has failed badly, and far from there
being a surplus of safflower oil because
of quotas, there continues to be large
imports of the product. And though
butter is heavily subsidised, the raw
materials used in margarine are equally
heavily protected in other ways.
In Canberra the speculation was that
margarine consortium was approaching
people in the Department of Trade.
After all, the Mining Industry Council
and the Australian Industries Develop-
ment Association have a pair of former
deputy-secretaries of the department as
their lobbymen. There have been
suggestions that the 'margarine people
were after the departmental head, Sir
Alan Westerman, but he would probably
only go to something more glamorous:
to an international shipping consortium
perhaps or an ambassadorship in Europe
or North America.
TAKEN BY THE BEARD
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT
has again shown its sedulous concern
for the moral well-being of the people
by raiding a flat to have the script of
the American play “The Beard”
declared obscene. A similar alacrity
was shown in Melbourne three months
ago, when the Vice Squad appeared at
the opening night of “America Hurrah”
to warn the Contact Theatre Com-
pany that it may have been about to
present an obscenity on the stage.
These actions are officially justified
by a prevention - is - better - than - cure
argument. A senior civil servant told
us that the Vice Squad’s vigilance could
be compared with that of a policeman
who saw that somebody was going to
park in a no-parking zone. It was
better to warn the man that he was
going to commit an offence than to
allow him to park his car and then
book him. Certainly the penurious
theatre companies which stage off-beat
plays will be glad of a warning and the
analogy is faultless — if you regard
free parking and free speech as being
on a par.
PLEASANT SUNDAY AFTERNOON
SO MANY important anniversaries in
Australia are celebrated in half-hearted,
lack-lustre fashion that to revive a
memorial day once it has been decently
buried seems to be unwise. Mr. Michael
White, of Ballarat, a 17-year-old
student, has sent an account of the
commemoration of the Eureka Stockade,
which was revived in that town this
year, on December 1, after it had lapsed
for four years.
“This year the Eureka Progress
Association revived the commemora-
tion of the Eureka Stockade and the
proud inheritors of the Eureka League
were called upon to attend in their
numbers, to ‘come in your car’ and, as
an ultimate tribute to the city’s
conscience, to ‘see and hear from your
car,’ ” Mr. White writes.
“Still, even without a car one could
gaze at the band of the Royal Aus-
tralian Armored Corps on the island in
the middle of the very muddy pool
which has been made the focal point
of the Eureka reserve. Admittedly, to
some it did seem strange that an Army
band should be present when, on
December 3, 1854, it was the Army
that stormed the stockade and 22 miners
were killed. But the secretary of the
Eureka Progress Association had
already noted that ‘the basis of the
afternoon would be a pleasant Sunday-
afternoon band concert,’ and so the
band played on with ‘Mammy’ and
selections from ‘South Pacific.’
“Meanwhile, at the actual monument,
about 100 yards away, the forces of
radicalism gathered. Members of the
Connolly Association of Australia were
there to honor the part of the Irish in
the struggle. (The Connolly Associa-
tion members follow the teachings of
James Connolly, the Irish Socialist
Republican executed following the
Easter Rebellion of 1916.) There were
Italians, honoring Carboni Raffaello,
who played a leading part in the
Eureka affair, and some Portuguese and
Spaniards.
“Speakers urged their small crowd to
remember the historical significance of
the day, 114 years ago, and a few
cheered. The secretary of the .Ballarat
Trades Hall Council spoke of Eureka,
the Spanish Civil War, and the situa-
tion in countries such as Spain, Portugal
and Greece. The Irish had the largest
contingent in the stockade, but no one
mentioned that the Americans had the
second largest; still there was one
smiling lady from the Connolly Associa-
tion with a banner protesting against
imperialism in Vietnam.
“And the band played on. The guest
speaker, Mr. Dudley Erwin, MHR,
seemed to be a trifle late, and down at
the pool the natives were becoming rest-
less. The Labor contingent then move
to the side of the pool. One man,
armed with a Eureka Republic flag
(blue with a white cross and stars)
emerged from the group and made his
way across the bridge which led to the
island. Emboldened by his success, three
more flag-bearers (Irish Republic,
Portuguese, and Spanish Republic) fol-
lowed him.
“Members of the Eureka Progress
Association decided that no more
should pass, and when a Knight of the
Southern Cross tried to cross the bridge
he was forced to return.
“Then Mr. Erwin arrived with the
Mayor of Ballarat. The official party
ignored the interlopers, although sitting
in front of the Spanish Republican flag
may have somewhat unnerved Mr.
Erwin. Decorum was carefully observed,
and the flag-bearing radicals sat stoic-
ally through the speeches, bravely
stifling their yawns. Mr. Erwin talked
about universal suffrage, the Mayor
about next year’s celebrations. As the
official party left the band was playing
‘The Impossible Dream.’ ”

AUSTRALIA
Defence: Cabinet begins to cohere
THE WORD being put around after
last week’s Cabinet meeting on the
much-publicised “strategic reassess-
ment” is that members of the Govern-
ment are at last getting closer to agree-
ment on defence. Prime Minister
Gorton was said to be slowly coming
around to the view that Australia must
retain ties with Malaysia and Singapore
by maintaining military forces there,
while at the same time Defence Mini-
ster Fairhall and External Affairs
Minister Hasluck, who have favored
initiatives in the region and a larger
defence establishment to back these up,
were said to be reconciling themselves
to delays and an unspectacular rate of
improvement in Australia’s defence
capability.
Some further announcements making
more positive the nature of Australian
commitments in Malaysia until 1971
should be made before Christmas,
according to Government sources, and
within the first six months of next year
there are expected to be two further
developments: an interim purchasing
program to remedy acute equipment
deficiencies in the Services and some
definition of defence policy beyond
1971.
Mr. Gorton’s main contribution to
last week’s Cabinet discussion of the
strategic paper was to emphasise the
large number of imponderables and
uncertainties facing Australia. He
seemed to believe that it was impossible
to lay down any definite policy until
these had been clarified. Some other
Ministers, however, feel that policy has
to be devised to cope with imponder-
ables and uncertainties, and that it is
impossible to go on without any guide-
lines. One of them was bold enough to
ask Mr. Gorton when he thought these
uncertainties would be clarified.
The Prime Minister’s reply, re-
portedly, was: “Quite early in the New
Year.” This then became unanimously
the basis for a collective Cabinet view
that after Mr. Gorton had had a chance
to speak to U.S. President-elect Nixon
the Government should resume work on
its protracted reassessment. By that
time, according to Mr. Gorton and his
supporters, the trend of the Paris peace
talks should be clear and it should be
possible to make a firmer assessment
of the likely outcome in Vietnam. It
would also be closer to the British
elections, and an assessment might be
possible of whether the Tories really
have a chance. The Conservative
Leader, Mr. Heath, was evidently taken
very seriously when he promised on his
visit to Australia earlier in the year
that he would send British troops back
The Prune Minister, Mr. Gorton, with
his Press secretary, Mr. Tony Eggleton,
buys a button for charity outside Parlia-
ment last week
into the Indian Ocean area. This possi-
bility is at least being used as an argu-
ment for holding Australia’s own situa-
tion until the possibilities of the British
election are clearer.
Some Ministers are confident that
Mr. Gorton is firming up on defence
policy, and it appears that the growing
Press criticism of Government procrast-
ination has caused the more-timid
Ministers to think again. One Minister
who has been rather critical of Mr.
Gorton’s approach to defence in the
past last week described him as having
been “more realistic” than at any time
since he had become Prime Minister.
Some. Ministers expect Mr. Gorton
will be able to make a major defence
statement when Parliament resumes in
the New Year, and denied the need for
him to see Mr. Nixon: “We know very
well what the Americans are thinking,”
he said.
The new defence purchases are likely
to be concerned almost entirely with
meeting deficiencies in the equipment
of the Services at their present man-
power levels. The Navy is tipped to
get a better deal than previously: a
new type of patrol boat is certain;
there will be several new escorts, though
not of the same sophistication and
expense as the DDGs at present being
received from the Americans, and
several new maintenance and support
ships. The Army is due to get replace-
ments for its utterly worn-out armored
personnel carriers, and to get light tanks
and more artillery. The Air Force wants
helicopter gunships of the sort the
Americans are using with such fear-
some results in Vietnam, and also
heavy-lift helicopter transports. Later in
the year orders will probably be placed
for transport aircraft and plans finalised
for Australia’s next aircraft project: a
supersonic close-support plane.
TAKEOVERS
GORTON'S NATIONALISM
MR. GORTON demonstrated his
nationalism again last week by moving
against foreign takeovers of local firms.
The Government in Canberra has no
constitutional authority in the field of
company law, but it can swing plenty
of influence. So last week the Prime
Minister, in a joint Press statement with
the Treasurer, said he had called the
president of the Australian Stock
Exchanges, Mr. C. Looker, and in-
formed him of the Government’s views.
These are that companies should be
able to restrict voting rights in their
shares to Australian citizens, enabling
them to ensure that control “remains
in Australian hands.”
The proposal represents a consider-
able change in policy toward foreign in-
vestment. Until Mr. Gorton came to
the Prime Ministership, the Government
generally supported the liberal Treasury
view which held that control of Aus-
tralian resources by foreign firms was
not something to get worried about:
such firms, like Australian businessmen,
were interested in making money, and
would be likely to behave in much the
same way. There was, therefore, no case
for discrimination against them.
Of course, there has always been a
strong emotional popular feeling against
foreign takeovers, the feeling that they
cannot contribute anything, while losing
the nation assets it previously had. In
the past, the Government’s reply to this
was that whatever the nominal owner-
ship, all fixed assets in Australia were
effectively Australian: employing Aus-
tralian workers, buying a good deal of
Australian materials, paying Australian
taxes, and producing largely for Aus-
tralians.
The Government put its view most
emphatically against interference in a
White Paper in 1965, when it said of
the consequences of such takeover bids:
“Much turns on what the overseas in-
terests acquiring a firm intend to make


The Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, talks to
the American Chamber of Commerce
luncheon in Canberra last week
of it. Maybe they intend to do nothing
in particular with the firm but just let
it run on more or less as before. Taking
what profit they can out of it, but try-
ing neither to expand nor to contract it.
On the whole, however, that would
seem to be a rather unlikely premise
since, in all probability, the buyers will
have had to bid fairly high, and unless
they do something to build the firm up,
they may not get much of a return on
their investment. If, on the other hand,
expansion is their aim, they may well
bring in more capital and perhaps new
processes, equipment, and managerial
methods and, from an economic stand-
point, that will be a gain to us.” It
has also been argued that takeovers may
often be necessary to enable an exces-
sively fragmented industry to be ration-
alised and given financial viability.
Anyway, whatever the merits, the
Treasury’s views are being rapidly
thrown overboard by Mr. Gorton in
favor of the more narrowly nationalist
views of Country Party Leader
McEwen.
Mr. Gorton is determined to make his
mark as a nationalist, and it helps his
relationship with his Country Party
colleague to take this line. Mr.
McMahon, as Treasurer, was of course
closely associated with the Prime Min-
ister in this latest move, and he is
powerfully backing his Prime Minister
in defending it. Mr. McMahon worked
hard on the project over several days
last week, but the statement itself is
attributed to the Secretary of the Prime
Minister’s Department, Mr. Len Hewitt.
It was not considered by Cabinet. There
is speculation that Mr. McMahon’s
motive in involving himself with the
new policy was largely to ensure that
nothing more extreme was done against

EXPENSIVE SPECTACLE
WHEN MISFORTUNE hits the oil
industry it is usually as spectacular as it
is expensive. The crisis at the $lO-
- Marlin drilling platform con-
tinued in that tradition. The drama has
been manifold: human, financial, and
geological, all played against the back-
drop of a debate about Australia’s oil
policies, the proportions of which
mirrored the scale of events at Gipps-
land.
Australia’s first concentrated illustra-
tion of the magnitude of oil develop-
ment costs began at sea off Victoria’s
east coast on Monday afternoon last
week. A tremor seemed to hit the huge
drilling platform and immediately
afterward gas burst to the surface in a
furious turbulence. Hours later the
somewhat promethean figure of “Red”
Adair was on a plane to do something
about a gas leak in one of the world’s
larger off-shore oilfields.
“Red” Adair began to symbolise the
risks and the profits involved. His
price for the job was variously estimated
at $lO,OOO a day, $500,000 for the
completed job, and at a few lower
figures. The general impression that it
cost Esso-BHP hundreds every time he
Natural gas hisses up from the seabed around the Marlin drilling rig in Bass Strait
blew his nose was probably just as
accurate. Having drunk with the locals
before the attempt to board the plat-
form began, Adair, who told them he
wore white asbestos underwear, not red,
was destined for undying fame.
What was just another job to him
was for the Esso-BHP consortium a
serious hold-up in the exploitation of
the Gippsland oilfield. Having already
invested $73 million in the field, they
are planning to lay out a further .$2lO
million for delivering and processing
oil and a further $55 million on further
development of the Halibut, Marlin,
and Kingfish oil-bearing structures.
The Marlin crisis has been proof to
many that the cost of an indigenous oil
industry will continue to be enormous
and the risks continuous. Sir Henry
Bolte found the opportunity to say that
Marlin had justified his long-held con-
viction that risk capital in great quan-
titles would be needed for development
and that a he attitude to foreign
investment would mean the death of an
Australian oil industry,
Although blow-outs are a common
occurrence in the world s oilfields—they
average about 40 a year major rig
disasters are not so frequent. In the past
18 y ears > 30 “major rig disasters” have
occurred, 20 of them involving the
destruction of the rigs. In total this cost
the oil ex P ! ° rers about * 95 million -
Sir Henry s point was echoed by the
°P industry. The words of Sir Colin
Syme, the chairman of BHP, were
recalled. He had told the shareholders
that the consortium was “operating on
tBe frontiers of technology and that
there were no certainties in the industry,
One estimate has Australia spending
$7OOO million over the next 20 years
merely to maintain self-sufficiency,
And on the day after the bubbles
erupted to the surface at Marlin the
exploration manager of Esso, Mr. J. D.
Langston, was also trying to contain the
flow of scepticism from some members
of the Senate select committee on off-
shore petroleum.
He refused to disclose the production
costs for the Gippsland oilfields, saying
that the consortium used the cash-flow
method of costing these long-range
investments, and he denied the sug-
gestions that his company would be
getting oil for nothing once capital
investment was written off. Mr. Lang-
ston said the high risk and high opera-
ting costs required that profits, when
they occurred shoidd also be high,
‘"Economists should not try to work
out production costs,” he said, “but
take geological surveys and find the cost
0 f exploring, producing, and developing
oil. They would then demonstrate by
putting the figures together that a viable
industry could be built in Australia, but
not without incentives.”
Rather breezily he said the chances of
finding commercial oil in Bass Strait


had been 50 or 100 to one. “If the risk
is 100 to one, then the profit should be
100 percent,” he said.
A week after the Marlin gas bubbles
began to rise the second round-table
talk in Canberra between the Common-
wealth Government and the representa-
tives of the oil industry tackled
the outstanding difficulties in Mr. Gor-
ton’s oil policies. The “cratering” caused
by the escaping gas on the Marlin sea
floor was paralleled by attempts by the
companies other than BHP to dig some
of the ground from under the detail of
Mr. Gorton’s policies.
Criticism that the Government’s
policies were being framed on an ad hoc
Above, the man of the moment, Mr.
“Red” Adair, discusses plans with Esso-
BHP executives, and, below, the Marlin
rig before trouble struck
basis and apparently mostly for Esso-
BHP’s benefit did not make the situa-
tion any easier. Nor did the general lack
of knowledge about Australia’s oil and
gas reserves make resolution of the
problems simple. The extent of the
Marlin field is the key to the volume
of production of the “lighter” Austra-
lian crude oil in 1970, when the contro-
versial import parity price comes into
force.
WOOL
ALL OVER AGAIN?
THE FIRST reaction in Canberra to
news that the Wool Industry Confer-
ence had at last reached agreement on
marketing was astonishment. Wool-
growers have for so long been fighting
among themselves that many officials
and Parliamentarians have come to take
internecine warfare in the wool industry
for granted. No one can remember just
when it all started, but they speculate
that some time in the mists of the past
someone on a sheep station put to the
bloke on the property next door the
idea that they might beat more money
out of the woolbrokers and buyers
by clubbing together. Perhaps they
could simply get together to hold their
wool off the selling floor until the price
was right. Perhaps they could destroy
the nerve-racking auction system
altogether.
Anyway, it appears they have been
arguing ever since. At least from then
until last Friday week. In Country
Party circles in Canberra, the news that
the woolgrowers seemed to think they
all knew what they wanted was greeted
with mixed feelings. The Country
Party has always felt that woolmen are
suspiciously Liberal Party in political
orientation, and as a result hasn’t felt
like doing much for them. And, of
course, as long as they have been
brawling among themselves the Country
Party hasn’t needed to do anything for
them either. So now that they seem
to agree, there is apprehension in
Canberra about what the new proposals
may cost.
Nevertheless, the offices of Primary
Industry Minister Anthony and Country
Party Leader McEwen are putting out
the line that they will look with favor
on the new scheme when it is put to
them. "There shouldn’t be any trouble
if it is only $6 million a year,” said one
Minister’s spokesman. “That’s chicken-
feed compared to what we dole out to
other industries.” But elsewhere in
Canberra there seems to be intense
scepticism about the value of the plan.
In essence, it is a very watered-down
version of the reserve price scheme
which was rejected in a referendum in
1965. Under that scheme, a marketing
authority run by the Government was
to buy up wool which didn’t fetch a
certain reserve price at auction. What,
the critics asked then, would
happen to the wool the authority
bought? For a while it might simply
be stockpiled, but eventually it would
have to be sold, and then it would
depress the market. People in the
Government wondered what would
happen if the reserve price was set
rather high and the authority had to
sell off lower than it bought. The
Government would have to foot the bill
on these trading losses, and with some
$lOOO million worth of wool being
traded each year, that could become
a big bill: so there would have to be
strict Government control. Since in
New' Zealand a similar scheme was an
unmitigated disaster, it was little wonder
that woolgrowers and the Government
rejected the idea.
The scheme just agreed to is a
weaker version of the rejected reserve
price system. It is based on exactly the
same theory, that somehow a bureau-
cratic authority with a manager and a
staff of researchers can accurately fore-
cast the fluctuations in the market and
outwit the commercial traders. But the
new version has a new name: “supply
management.”
The opposition to organised market-
ing has collapsed because this new non-
statutory authority looks like being a
“paper tiger.” Since it will be non-
statutory, it won’t be able to tie up
large amounts of money by extravagant
exercises in market manipulation. It
won’t be able to enforce its policies
because dissatisfied woolgrowers will
be able to by-pass it by negotiating
private sales. The whole scheme is so
hemmed around by financial and legal
restrictions that it will be unable to do
much damage. On the other hand, it
can’t do much good either. For this
reason it may still not get Government
or bank support.
In fact, the “supply management”
system may work like a reserve-price
system in reverse, since it is supposed
to follow the market from day to day.
If prices are tending down, the
authority will find that it is doing more
selling than buying in order to prevent
an excessive stockpile accumulating;
but in the process it will be accentu-
ating the price fall, and accentuating
the degree of market fluctuation. So
what’s in it for woolgrowers? The
general conclusion in Canberra is that
Wool Board chairman Bill Gunn, in his
gargantuan efforts at ending the war,
has come up with such a funny settle-
ment that the fighting may start all
over again.
Sir William Gunn...another fight
ahead?


ABORIGINES
BEER ON TAP
OP ALL THE MATTERS covered by
the 1966 Royal Commission into the
South Australian Licensing Act, the
recommendations made concerning
Aboriginal drinking rights have proved
to be, in the long run, the most con-
tentious. South Australians have
accepted ten-o’clock closing, extended
restaurant drinking hours, and limited
Sunday drinking with a minimum of
fuss and remarkably mild protests from
the teetotal community. With Aboriginal
drinking, however, familiar problems
emerged as the State’s Aboriginal
population took advantage of an almost
total lifting of drinking restrictions. The
only two areas where restrictions still
apply are on the Coober Pedy and
North West reserves.
Most criticism of the lifting of restric-
tions came from welfare workers faced
with what they see as an increasing
incidence of Aboriginal alcoholism, the
most distressing effect of which is mal-
nutrition among a large number of
Aboriginal children. From the west
coast and the township of Ceduna, in
particular, came stories of disorder and
threatened violence to white women
and children by drunken Aborigines.
Subsequent investigations by the
Department of Aboriginal Affairs found
that to a great extent these stories were
more remarkable for their color than
their facts, though there had been minor
incidents of the kind to be found near
any beery suburban pub on a Saturday
evening.
However, reports of widespread
Aboriginal drunkenness have recently
been renewed, and one Government
backbencher has been prompted to
argue that “disaster had overtaken all
but a small proportion of the State’s
Aborigines since they were given free
access to alcohol.” Aboriginal Affairs
Minister Millhouse said that although
things were getting better there was no
doubt that since the lifting of restric-
tions there had been a great deal of
suffering. However, he did not intend
to withdraw the drinking rights, since
“this would only take us back to the
old days of illicit drinking and illicit
supply of liquor.”
Reflecting both the concern of local
welfare agencies and the complexity of
the problem, last week the South Aus-
tralian Licensing Court granted per-
mission to the Lutheran Church of Aus-
tralia to operate a wet canteen at its
Aboriginal mission, Yalata, some 150
miles from Ceduna. It is thus probably
the only church in Australia to hold a
liquor licence. The licence is to operate
following the completion of a $20,000
recreation hall, which will have the
canteen at one end, “just like an RSL
hall,” a church spokesman said. It will
serve a mission population of about 200
adults and is designed to be “flexible
and experimental,” with patrons being
served two opened cans of beer per
person per day at 33 cents a can.
With a total population of between
300 and 400, and served by a school,
medical centre, general store, workshop,
and administration centre, Yalata is a
small but active mission community.
The Aborigines earn an average weekly
income of $8 each from the manufac-
ture of boomerangs and their artifacts,
which the church merchandises on their
behalf, and from occasional station and
farm work in the area. Most of the
Aborigines live by choice in bark
wurlies near the mission area, and it
has been a practice among some to
pool their resources and trudge the
150 miles into Ceduna or the 80 miles
to Penong to buy large quantities of
cheap wine, which would be sub-
sequently drunk in one explosive sitting.
The mission hopes to teach the
Aborigines to drink more rationally.
If the mission succeeds, the Govern-
ment has indicated that licences may
become available for other reserves and
missions. But in its wisdom and experi-
ence in these matters the Licensing
Court itself was possibly wondering if
hardened Aboriginal drinkers would be
satisfied with a mere two-pint daily
beer ration. Certainly its judgment did
not sound over-optimistic. “We con-
fess,” it said, “to some doubt that the
effect of the licence will be as bene-
ficial as the sponsors hope.”
NEW SOUTH WALES
BREATH OF LIFE
THE BILL introducing Professor
Borkenstein’s instrument for blood-
alcohol analysis—the breathalyser—into
New South South Wales passed its three
stages in the Legislative Assembly last
week amid one of the rowdiest scenes
for many years—with words like ‘'rotten
liar,” “guttersnipe,” and “mug” being
freely, if briefly, bandied about the
chamber. The violence, however, was
due less to the passion with which prin-
ciples were entertained than to the
Government’s application of the gag
and the interruption this caused to the
Labor Party’s Christmas party by call-
ing Labor Members back into the
Chamber to vote on the gag. This week
the Bill goes to the Upper House and
the new Breathalyser Squad should be
operating Professor Borkenstein’s
instrument before Christmas.
Transport Minister Morris has relied
on Queensland figures, showing that in
about half of all road deaths alcohol is
an important contributing factor. Every
year about 6000 N.S.W. citizens are
fined for driving under the influence,
but now a new offence will be intro-
duced of driving or attempting to drive
with a blood alcohol content of 0.08
grams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of
blood. This should catch many
dangerous drivers who are not neces-
sarily obviously driving under the
influence.
The N.S.W. system will follow the
Queensland and British system. There
will be first a roadside test in which
a policeman may require a suspected
driver to blow into a plastic bag. If
the crystals in this bag turn green up
to a certain point, a compulsory breath-
alyser test will then be required. The
suspect will be escorted to a police
station, where a member of the Breath-
alyser Squad will give the test. The
suspect will be required to wait 20
minutes before being tested to allow time
for alcohol in the body to get into the
blood. (You can drink quite a lot of
whisky which will not show on a breath-
alyser for at least 20 minutes). If the
test shows that the suspect has 0.08
grams of blood alcohol in 100 millilitres
of blood, he will be charged. If the
driver challenges the accuracy of the
test he may ask for a blood test to be
taken, but at late hours of the night
he will need to be lucky to find a doctor
willing to come to give the blood test.
The Labor Opposition supports the
introduction of the breathalyser, but
demands three main changes in the Bill.
It wants the Victorian system, which
N.S.W. Minister for Transport Milton
Morris behind the wheel of a driver-
training car
does without the roadside plastic-bag
test. It claims that English figures show
that fewer than 25 percent of drivers
whose roadside tests are positive are
found in the subsequent breathalyser
test to have the prohibited amount of
blood alcohol. This means that they are
arrested for up to two hours before
being released on passing the breath-
alyser test. The Opposition also claims
that the plastic-bag kits often fail to
operate correctly and that the roadside
system will encourage the police-
hounding of motorists. The police will
not be empowered to engage in random
roadside testing; they must first be satis-
fied that the driver appears to be driv-
ing with the prohibited amount of blood
alcohol. However, the Opposition con-
siders that some policemen will wait
near hotels at closing time and will be
able to safely indulge in random testing
while appearing to follow the letter of
the law.
The Opposition further demands that
the men operating the breathalysers be
civilians from outside the police force,
as in Queensland, where the tests are
administered by doctors. Thirdly, it


demands that a driver who passed the
breathalyser test should not be liable to
be charged with driving under the
influence. Mr. Morris has agreed to
examine this last suggestion.
The Bill clearly places new restraints
on N.S.W. motorists. But the Govern-
ment maintains that if any citizen
decides to enter the road game and
propel a heavy lethal weapon along the
roads he must be prepared to accept
special rules to protect life. Mr. Morris
modestly hopes that his Bill may save
120 lives in N.S.W. next year.
COMMUNISM
AN AARONS PARTY?
THE MOST unpopular man in Aus-
tralia in the Russian Embassy in
Canberra is now Mr. Laurie Aarons,
leader of the Australian Communist
Party, which in its internal party
structure has become one of the most
liberal, if not the most liberal, of the
world’s Communist Parties, with some-
thing like a two-thirds anti-Stalinist
majority.
The reason, for the Russians’ detest-
ation of the Australian Party is obvious
enough. It was the first Party to attack
the Soviet invasion of Czechoslavakia
and its criticisms of Russia are con-
sistently embarrassing. The Russian
reaction to this is also obvious enough.
They have cut off much of their finan-
cial help to the Party. Previously this
was provided in dealings in books and
other publications, and in. other ways;
now there is not much of this kind of
indirect financing. The position is so
serious for the Party that it is now
taking functionaries off the Party pay-
roll; they are getting jobs in Communist-
controlled trade unions instead.
This may not be the end of the
matter. There is some evidence that the
Russians may be so fed up with some
of the “reformist” Parties of the West
-—in particular the British, French, and
Australian Parties • —• that they may
get round to setting up new Communist
Parties in these countries. They would
find- it easy enough to find leaders for

opening?

dor Tarakanov
their own Party from among some of
the dissidents in the Aarons Party.
What would then happen is hard to
say. There would be a Peking Com-
munist Party, a Moscow, Communist
Party and an Aarons-led Australian
Communist Party. An independent
Aarons Party would have much
'greater political flexibility and there-
fore potential political strength than
the other two, but it would lack all
external support, both material and
the kind of psychological sustenance
gained from connection with a super-
power.
Mr. Aarons himself would probably
look for an opening out toward the
Left Wing of the Labor Party, and
more generally to all kinds of indivi-
duals and people within the Commun-
ists who see themselves as “Left” or
Marxist without wishing to be sub-
jected to the old Party disciplines. One
interpretation is that there would then
be a considerable penetration of the
Labor Party; a quite opposite interpre-
tation is that Mr. Aarons and his asso-
ciates might prefer a Party of their
own, if more broadly based than the
present one.
If this were to be so, there could be
significant defections from the Labor
Party which might change its whole
nature, so that it could again become
an effective Opposition and a credible
alternative Government.
GAMBLING
KEEP VICE OUT
OF TASMANIA
MANY OF TASMANIA’S 145,000
voters, especially the 50,000 or so who
live in the north of the island, are
wondering why they should have to
vote on December 14 on whether there
should be a gambling casino at Wrest
Point in Hobart. Presumably they have
to because the issue, stated basically
from some pulpits as Materialism or
Morality? has sharply divided all
groups who have discussed it, including
both Houses of Parliament, on non-
Party lines.
The State Labor Government, very
much for the casino sin.ee Federal
Hotels Ltd. first proposed it almost a
year ago, could not overcome dissent
within its ranks to force a Bill through
Parliament, so it opted for the refer-
endum, trusting that self-interest would
swing Tasmanians against the usual
Australian inclination to vote “No” at
referendums. The “Yes” or Materialism
case had strong public backing from
the outset, notably from the combined
Chambers of Commerce and all others
connected with tourism, who felt the
casino would bring no new sins to
Tasmania, but would bring many more
international tourists and their money.
The “No” or Morality spokesman
said as firmly that the proposed casino
would attract the worst kinds of
criminals to Tasmania, with vice,
drugs, and prostitution. Alternatively,
Reece ...for the casino
it would demoralise ordinary people
simply by creating opportunity for
them to gamble at will. And the “No”
spokesmen set all this against possible
State income from casino gambling
royalties, which might be as little as
$40,000.
Two weeks ago both cases were ham-
mered down to 1000 words each at
meetings of “Yes” and ■ “No” sup-
porters in two chambers of the Parlia-
ment. Then they were submitted to
Premier Reece and, finally, to the
Chief Electoral Officer, who had them
published twice in Tasmania’s three
daily newspapers. Details of the Wrest
Point Casino and Development Bill
were also published.
In passing the Wrest Point' Casino
Licence and Development (Refer-
endum) Act, Parliament also laid down
that electoral rules should apply; that
all posters should bear the name and
address of authoriser and printer, with
a penalty of up to $2OO, or up to six
months in jail; that anyone displaying
illegal posters was liable to up to $4O
or two months; that advertising must
cease on referendum day, and that
canvassing would be prohibited within
100 yards of polling booths. But last
week, in the heat of the campaign,
these regulations were being breached
wholesale.
Health Minister Everett took one set
of posters to the Commissioner of
Police in Hobart, alleging they were not
only breaching the regulations but
were also criminally libelling him. As
they propagated the “No” or Morality
case he felt moved to add, “Such
tactics are not consistent with the
moral views which many opponents of
the proposal have expressed.”
The “No” supporters were not
relying on posters, however. They held
State-wide doorknocks on the two
Sundays before the referendum to
drive home the message, implicit in
their air media advertising “Keep
vice out of Tasmania.” In reply, their
opponents were holding to a line best
expressed by the solid black heading
over Tasmania Tourist Council manager
R. E. Clarke’s letter to the “Examiner.”
It read: TOURISM PAYS.

INTERNATIONAL
Britain’s pull-out becomes real
AT AN OFFICIAL ceremony on Sun-
day, Britain gave up the great naval
dockyard in Singapore, her biggest base
overseas, as part of the east of Suez
rundown which is to see the last British
soldiers gone by 1971.
But as the Singapore State Enter-
prise, which is to convert the dockyard
to commercial use, took over the
civilian staff from the Navy, eight giant
Vulcan bombers of the RAF flashed
into the Tengah airfield, after flying
27 hours “westabout” from the United
Kingdom as a demonstration that
Britain would still be capable of com-
ing to Singapore’s assistance against an
aggressor even after all permanent
forces have been withdrawn to Europe.
Eleven jet transports of the RAF
served this flight of Britain’s “nuclear
bats,” carrying the ground maintenance
teams, the spare crews, the equipment
and the heavy-lifting machinery that
would make the whole group self-
sufficient on arrival and ready for
action. But they could equally well
have brought in a full battalion group
of infantry and supporting arms, plus
command vehicles, jeeps, and armored
cars.
Early next year the RAF will follow
up with a high-speed “eastabout” flight
from England of supersonic 1500 mph
Lightnings, which will refuel in the
air. Moreover, the Army advisory
group in Singapore is already working
on a major combined services exercise
in 1970, which is expected to involve
switching a full brigade of fresh troops
to these territories under emergency
conditions. Britain could also keep a
mixed force of warships and carrier-
based commandos at sea in these
waters, which could be maintained by
Singapore’s commercial dockyard under
contract (provided the price was right).
Britain’s promise to fly to the rescue
will be meaningless, however, if there
is no operational air base to fly into
and no effective technical organisation
on the ground for providing the local
co-operation which incoming men and
machines will need to wage war. Can
London’s pied-a-terre strategy therefore
be taken seriously?
The horizon has brightened in the
past six months. The Singapore Gov-
ernment of Premier Lee Kuan Yew has
ordered 20 Hawker Hunter jets and
16 Provost trainers from Britain and
Alouette helicopters from France, and
Singaporeans are now undergoing
training in both countries. It has
snapped up Air-Marshal Sir Rochford
Hughes, now commander of the Far
East Air Force, to organise Singapore’s
own fledgling service when he retires
from the RAF next February. It is
opening a technical school for ground
crews, for which staff are now being
trained abroad, and it has already estab-
Singapore’s
Goh Keng
Swee...
10 percent
on defence
by 1971
lished a flying school. Singaporeans
will take over traffic control at Seletar
airfield when the RAF ceases opera-
tions there next April and they have
started to move into Tengah, Britain’s
finest RAF base overseas, which is
expected to be a central turntable for
any joint Commonwealth defence
system of the future in the Far East.
Singapore trainees are also working in
the big radar complex on the island
which complements the other main
installation in North Malaysia.
It is expected that Britain will mainly
provide sophisticated air and naval
support for Malaysia and Singapore
against any invader after 1971, and that
they themselves must contribute most
of the ground forces. In his pug-
nacious budget speech last week, Dr.
Goh Keng Swee, Singapore’s Minister
of Finance, disclosed that this pocket
republic would spend nearly $lOO
million on defence this year—sso for
everyone on the island—and he expects
to devote 10 percent of the gross
national product to the armed forces
by 1971.
Next year Singapore will have two
infantry brigades with ancillary arms
and an armored unit in training, sup-
ported by four auxiliary defence bat-
talions. By 1979, 30 reserve battalions
will be available for immediate mobi-
lisation. Malaysia has some 34,000
regulars under arms, supported by
23,000 men in highly effective para-
military field companies, and has also
warned that defence expenditure will
be increased.
Although no serving British per-
sonnel are supposed to remain behind
after 1971, seconded and retired officers
and technical warrant officers will con-
tinue working with the local armed
forces under contract.
VIETNAM
WHY KY WENT TO PARIS
THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE delega-
tion has arrived in Paris for the peace
talks believing that the Saigon Govern-
ment has won major concessions from
the Johnson Administration. But it is
still hoping to avoid any major deci-
sions until President Nixon takes office
and until Mr. Averell Harriman has
been replaced as chief American negoti-
ator in Paris.
The Saigon delegation also expects
hard fighting in their homeland during
their absence, hard bargaining with both
First of the South Vietnamese to arrive in Paris, Nguyen Thieu Nhon


the Americans and the North Viet-
namese at the conference, and a spec-
tacular propaganda struggle with the
Communists. Certainly, as the peace
talks begin, American and Vietnamese
officials expect the Communists to
maintain and quite possibly escalate
their policy of “fighting while talking.”
What form the fighting may take is a
matter of debate. Some American
soldiers predict another concerted Com-
munist offensive. But some political
observers believe that the Communists
will revert to guerilla and terrorist
operations. It is significant that Presi-
dent Thieu has begun a review of the
current pacification program.
The political developments in
South Vietnam which finally brought
a Saigon delegation to Paris must be
viewed as a continuation of the heated
palace discussions that took place before
President Johnson announced the bomb-
ing halt on November 1. Only a few
hours before that announcement, Ameri-
can officials had rejected a last-minute
•compromise proposal by Vice-President
Ky that Saigon should send a delega-
tion to Paris to talk directly with
Hanoi but only on procedural ques-
tions. The Americans rejected this
proposal on the grounds that such pro-
cedural discussions would take months,
and Washington, being in a hurry,
wanted something much more substan-
tial to be discussed. Only then did
President Thieu refuse to send a dele-
gation to the Paris meeting on
November 6. In the following weeks,
the Thieu Government managed to get
the substance of that last-minute pro-
posal by Vice-President Ky accepted
by the Americans. Specifically, the
Americans agreed to direct discussions
between Hanoi and Saigon on any
future political settlement. And,
initially at least, the Saigon delegation
bas gone to Paris simply to discuss
procedures. That stage in the dis-
cussion, some South Vietnamese officials
predict, may last as long as three
months.
The Americans also used the tradi-
tional carrot and stick approach to
Saigon. The big stick was the threat
made by the Secretary of Defence,
Mr. Clark Clifford, that Saigon might
find itself left out in the cold. The
carrots were the conciliatory manners
and concessions made in Saigon by the
American Ambassador, Mr. Ellsworth
Bunker, who sweated out seven drafts
before the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment approved the final statement.
This statement gave the South Viet-
namese Government not only face-
saving devices but the political assur-
ances it had long wanted: no auto-
matic American approval for a coali-
tion Government in the south (which
Saigon officials, including reputedly
even President Thieu, suspected the
Johnson Administration had already
tacitly agreed to with Hanoi), no terri-
torial division of South Vietnam, direct
Saigon-Hanoi talks on the future politi-
cal settlement in the south, and explicit
and public definition of a two-sided
Paris conference j-ather than the four-
sided conference that the Communists
had been pressing for. As a result,
President Thieu’s own Government is
more united than it has ever been
before and its domestic prestige has
been enhanced.
AFRICA
DAME ZARA'S GAFFE
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY of Dame
Zara Holt, widow of the former Austra-
lian Prime Minister, has produced an
angry row in Commonwealth capitals.
The Australian Government is to be
asked to put the record straight on a
particular passage which occurs in
Dame Zara’s book “My Life and
Harry” which has caused greatest
offence. [
Writing of the 1966 Commonwealth
Prime Ministers’ Conference, which
took the crucial decision on No Inde-
pendence Before Majority Rule in
Rhodesia, Dame Zara says she remem-
Mr. Holt and Mr. Wilson at the 1966 Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Conference
bers “poor Harry” coming back after
each session complaining that the Afri-
cans all talked too long and showed no
real sense of responsibility toward other
Commonwealth members.
The offending passage recounts how
“one particular man” stood up when
Rhodesia was being discussed and
shouted “Kill, kill, kill,” a cry “taken
up by practically every African Prime
Minister from then on.” Participants in
the conference all agree that none of
the Prime Ministers at any time used
the words “Kill, kill, kill.” The sug-
gestion that this was the theme of
most of the African leaders is dis-
missed as entirely erroneous.
But the dilemma for the Common-
wealth Secretary-General, Mr. Arnold
Smith, is that since all Prime Ministers’
Conferences are confidential he has no
authority to put the record straight.
The British Government feels itself
bound by the same constraint.
These explanations, though accepted
by Commonwealth African Govern-
ments, do not satisfy their feeling that
there is a need to correct the damaging
effects of Dame Zara’s recollections.
Kenya’s High Commissioner in London,
Dr. J. N. Karanja, one of the African
representatives who attended the 1966
Conference, has proposed to his Gov-
ernment that further action is required.
There is general agreement in Com-
monwealth circles in London that the
only way out of Dame Zara’s diplo-
matic gaffe is for the Australian Gov-
ernment to take the initiative in put-
ting the record straight. It is thought
that the misunderstanding in Dame
Zara’s account arose from the demand
often expressed at the 1966 meeting that
Britain should use force to deal with
the Rhodesian crisis. It is possible that,
speaking colloquially, Mr. Holt inter-
preted the demand for British force
to be used as a cry for “Kill, kill,
kill.”


FRANCE
MARCH DEVALUATION?
France’s Foreign Minister, Michel Debre (centre) is now the most influential voice
favoring devaluation of up to 25 percent
GENERAL DE GAULLE has won the
first round in his battle to save the
Franc, but he has not ended the
devaluation debate still being thrashed
out inside the Government. A strong
body of opinion there is thought to be
building up in favor of a “big” devalua-
tion—of the order of 25 percent—in the
early spring.
The most influential voice now urging
detailed contingency planning for such
a move is believed to be that of Foreign
Minister Michel Debre, one of the
General’s most loyal lieutenants, who
has previously served him as Prime
Minister and Finance Minister.
In support of a February or March
devaluation, the “Debre school” is
thought to argue that:
' (a) President Nixon, whom the
French now portray as a friend of
France with “sound” views on gold, will
then be in the saddle; (b) careful plan-
ning will ensure the maximum success,
and (c) a pump-priming operation at
that moment will powerfully aid the
Government in its sticky confrontation
with the unions over tbe whole range
of national wages scheduled for next
March.
Some Ministers argue that nothing
short of a spring devaluation and a
vigorous economic upswing can head
off an explosion of social unrest next
year. Indeed, the Government’s imme-
diate worry is whether this week’s
budget-slashing and price- and wage-
pegging will not be overtaken by dis-
turbances before the winter is out.
Last week, de Gaulle’s most vocifer-
ous Right-wing critic, Maitre Tixier-
Vitnancour, predicted that devaluation
would come “within a hundred days of
the return from Elba.”
There have been rumblings of trouble
in schools, universities, even factories,
but these cannot be specifically linked
to the new austerity package. At
Renault, the French industry pace-
maker, a strike is threatened. At the
University annex of Nanterre, seedbed
of the student revolt, riot police moved
in this week following ominously
familiar scuffles in which the Dean was
knocked down by young revolutionaries.
Very heavy reinforcements of gen-
darmerie are now stationed in the Latin
Quarter, the long columns of parked
police trucks lending the streets some-
thing of the sombre tone of last spring’s
insurgency.
The Government is obviously jittery,
but the overall impression is that people
are only now waking up to the implica-
tions of the General’s spectacular deci-
sion. Every day brings a batch of
decrees spelling out the programs to be
axed, the new mechanics of price con-
trols, and the traps to catch foreign-
exchange speculators.
The unions seem defensive rather
than offensive. They are worried about
unemployment, but their main objective
is to preserve for their members the
substantial social benefits wrested from
the Government last June. Few union
leaders want to risk the charge of being
unpatriotic by complaining of the Gov-
ernment’s belt-tightening.
RUSSIA
WHAT'S IN A NAME?
SINISTER MEMORIES must have
come back to many Russians when they
read last week’s Tass announcement
that the Ministry of Public Order was
to revert to its old title of Ministry of
the Interior —or MVD. The assurance
that the ministry would continue to
work according to the “strictest observ-
ance of socialist legality” may not have
entirely reassured those who associate
the MVD with the dreaded name of
Beria, even though the security police
were removed from the control of the
MVD soon after Beria’s death.
The reason given for the change of
name is that the title Ministry of Public
Order does not adequately reflect all the
functions carried out by the ministry.
There is no way of telling at present
whether that is the only reason. All we
have been told is that the ordinary
police, or militia, who are controlled by
the MVD, are to have more pay and
better conditions of work and equip-
ment; and that a better type of person,
with a more advanced political educa-
tion, is to be recruited into the force.
The ostensible aim is to strengthen
public order, which includes a multi-
tude of sins from petty teenage hooli-
ganism to large-scale speculation by
“social parasites.” It remains to be seen
whether the militia are to extend their
activities into the political field normally
covered by the KGB, or security police
—helping, for instance, to stop the dis-
semination of underground literature.
In any case, Mr. Khrushchev’s
attempt in 1962 to improve the public
image of the militia by giving their
ministry a new name has apparently
been abandoned. Whatever the full
motives for the change turn out to be,
Mr. Brezhnev and his colleagues were
evidently not worried about giving the
Russian people a severe psychological
shock. Perhaps that is what they meant
to do.
THE BALKANS
SHADES OF GREY
BOTH President Tito and Mr. Dean
Rusk trod delicately along the path of
deterrence at their recent meeting.
There is no direct Russian military
threat to Yugoslavia at present and
neither wishes to provide the' Russians
with an excuse for posing one. But
both President Tito and the American
Secretary of State know that Warsaw
Pact manoeuvres in Rumania next year
are probable.
This must worry the Rumanians as
much as the Yugoslavs. President
Ceausescu felt obliged to let a Warsaw
Pact military conference, with Marshal
Yakubovsky, the supreme commander,
in the chair, take place in Bucharest
earlier this month. But in a speech
to the Rumanian national assembly
immediately afterward he explicitly
rejected the theory that the common
defence of the Warsaw Pact countries
“presupposes the limitation or renun-
ciation of the sovereignty of a member
State”; and if he does have to allow
Warsaw Pact manoeuvres to take place
in his country he will want to get the
date of the departure of the Russian
troops firmly buttoned up first. So will


the Yugoslavs. But, having carried out
a dry run in Czechoslovakia before the
invasion, it would be in keeping with
the cautious nature of Soviet military
thinking for the Russians to practise
an approach march to the Yugoslav
borders, just in case they ever decided
to make one in earnest.
So, at his Press conference after the
meeting with Mr. Rusk, President Tito
insisted that there was no need to over-
dramatise the situation; at the same
time he made it plain that in the event
of aggression Yugoslavia would fight to
defend its independence. As Yugoslavia
had sufficient forces of its own, he said,
to defend its sovereignty, “there would
be no need for us to call on anyone to
help us.” The grey zone in Europe, he
added, stopped at Yugoslavia’s borders.
But, as all politicians and diplomats
know, there is a world of difference
between ex ante and ex post requests.
In a television interview the next
day, Mr. Dean Rusk went off along
much the same tack. He denied that
NATO had extended its obligations at
the Brussels meeting in November, but
he added that things can happen out-
side the formal treaty area which “can
affect the security of NATO.” In other
words, the military balance, though
Mr. Rusk did not specifically say so,
could be altered as much in the Balkans
as it already has been in Central
Europe—and NATO would have to do
something about it. And in private talks
with other NATO ministers Mr. Rusk
admitted that he had had to refer to
“possible specifics.”
One of those “specifics” must have
been what the Western Powers might
do if Yugoslavia were to be invaded
and called for help. At the political
level, deterrence is often pursued
through such mights and maybes. But
in military planning they have to be
turned into something more concrete.
No formal plans concerning Yugoslavia
are being drawn up in NATO at the
moment. Nor are they likely to be, since
some of the smaller NATO Powers are
clearly unhappy about the grey area
concept. But what has emerged, how-
ever temporarily, is a common mode
of thinking among the Powers most
intimately concerned with Yugoslavia.
They include the United States, Britain,
Italy, and Greece.
Their belief appears to be that any
invasion of Yugoslavia would have to
be mounted from Rumania as well as
Hungary and that, before long, the
Yugoslavs would be forced to resort to
guerilla operations in the mountains.
In that event, some of the Western
Powers, if called upon to help, might
be prepared to consider shipping and
flying supplies in to the Yugoslav
guerillas. That would mean that the
NATO Powers would at once have to
establish firm naval control of the
Adriatic (which in particular would
involve the deployment of the American
Sixth Fleet) and be prepared to defend
their own aircraft and bases.
“Keep the Russians guessing”, seems
to be NATO’s motto today. Such think-
ing plays on Russian fears about the
Tito...no over dramatisation
possibility of a military confrontation
with the West. That could have some
deterrent value. But, in thinking this
way, the Western Powers court the risk
of being sucked through the door as it
swings wider on its hinges. They would
want, it seems, to avoid committing
ground troops to direct support of the
Yugoslavs. But if they were prepared
to supply arms and supplies, they would
almost certainly have to deploy land
force in neighboring NATO countries.
Not all the NATO Powers might
agree to that. And, even if they did, the
troops, hardly in abundant supply in
Europe, would have to come from some-
where. The lead could come only from
one country, the United States. There,
so Mr. Henry Kissinger says, “one of
the legacies of the war in Vietnam will
be a strong American reluctance to risk
overseas involvements.” When Presi-
dent Nixon takes office and Mr. Kis-
singer becomes his assistant for national
security affairs, will such a writ run in
the grey areas of the Balkans?
TONGA
STRUCK OIL
TONGANS HAVE brought the com-
plex business of oil exploration down
to grass-roots level, and in typical
south-seas fashion. While big-time oil
company executives bustle in and out
of Nuku’alofa, the capital, the local
citizenry are digging for it in their
gardens. The Tongan Government has
advised people there to prospect with
crowbars, sticks, and hoes. The sug-
gestion came from Mr. J. C. Grover,
Director of Geological Surveys of the
Fiji Government. He advises Tongans
to make small holes in the ground and
insert a coconut frond. If oil is present,
he says, the frond will come out
dripping with oil and water.
Of the nine confirmed oil finds to
date, seven of them are in Nuku’alofa
(the other two are on Eua Island,
where the original oil seeps were
sighted), and all are only a foot or
two below the surface. Mr. Grover has
described the rocks from which the
oil is coming as “dense vugual lime-
stone,” which means the oil is flowing
through tiny channels in the rock. His
department’s analyses show the crude is
between 13deg. and 20deg. API gravity,
of a semi-bitter asphaltic type. He says
there also are indications of pressure in
the oil.
Air-charter firms in Fiji are reaping
much benefit from the Tonga oilrush.
Oil companies’ executives come winging
into Nandi International Airport from
Australia, the United States, and
Canada, then quickly charter a small
aircraft for the three-hour flight to
Tonga. One Texan was actually on
holiday in Fiji when he read the news
in the local paper. He left his family
sitting on the beach while he flew off
for a two-day investigation in Tonga
after having telephoned his company
in Houston to say: “This thing’s too
hot to sit on.”
Some of the companies who have
been to Tonga in the past couple of
weeks are British Petroleum, Mobil
Exploration, Shell Oil Co., Republic
Mineral Corp., of Houston, Texas,
Canadian Superior Oil Ltd., France’s
Aquitaine Group, even Texas Eastern
Transmission Corporation, whose repre-
sentative did not agree with the sug-
gestion he was being a trifle premature.
Reports from inside the gingerbread
wooden palace in Nuku’alofa suggest
King Taufa’ahau Tupou is enjoying the
attention. But it is noted, too, that His
Majesty is preparing to be hard-headed
when the time comes to get down to
brass tacks. “He’s done a terrific amount
of homework on the oil industry,”
according to one friend. The King is
said to spend days and nights poring
over books, articles, and foreign govern-
ment’s legislation concerning oil. A
European in Fiji who is relatively close
to the King says: “If any oil company
smartie thinks he’s going to pull any
fast ones on the King, he’s in for a big
surprise. Tongans may be delightfully
simple people, but the King is going
to bargain hard.”
To ensure he doesn’t miss any good
offers, His Majesty’s Government has
extended its original deadline of
November 30 for applications to be in
to January 6. It is believed the King
will not necessarily accept any appli-
cant; that he’ll haggle for better
propositions before granting anything to
anyone.
Meanwhile, the barracuda-like
methods of the international oil com-
panies continue to function. One or two
of them have had geologists examining
maps of Fiji’s remote and enchanted
Lau group of islands. The group lies in
the same basin Tonga’s islands. In
fact, the most I 'Southerly of them are
nearer to Nuku’alofa than they are to
Suva. Detailed maps and charts of the
area are being prepared, and now Fiji,
too, waits for the oilmen.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
President Johnson. .. what now?
LBJ's FUTURE?
THE FUTURE plans of President
Johnson have been the subject of much
conjecture in his native Texas. He has a
myriad of offers to go into business,
banking, ranching, teaching, writing, and
lecturing. It is highly unlikely that he
will retire to the LBJ ranch on the
banks of the Pedernales, although he is
wealthy enough to do that if he chose.
At least ten Texas banks have asked
him to serve, in varying capacities from
president down. Four universities have
asked him to return to his first pro-
fession, teaching. Trustees of the
Houston “Chronicle,” the largest news-
paper in Texas, want to sell him the
profitable publication. Many Texas
politicians want him to run for the
Senate again in either 1970 or 1972.
President Johnson has two major
private businesses which could take up
most of his time. One is the Texas
Broadcasting Company, a radio and TV
syndicate worth about $10 million,
which the President started in the early
1940s by acquiring a radio station for
$17,000. His wife and two daughters
own 85 percent of the shares of Texas
Broadcasting. The President’s heart is
probably closer to his cattle ranches,
estimated to be worth $2 million, which
he has constantly been expanding
through major purchases of real estate.
He is expected to donate the LBJ
ranch, the “Little White House,” to the
Federal Government one day. Mean-
while, he is building a new home on
12 acres he owns in downtown Austin,
the capital of Texas.
A DUBIOUS EQUALITY
ROY INNIS, national director of the
Congress of Racial Equality, last week
startled an international conference of
intellectuals at Princeton University by
presenting a plan for a separate Negro
nation composed of the ghettoes of
American cities.
“We want a social contract between
blacks and whites sharing the same
piece of geography,” Innis said. In
order to control their own destiny,
Negroes did not need “integration” but
“the separatism of islands immersed in
land.” Those islands, he explained,
would be the Negro ghettoes of the
major U.S. cities, linked politically as a
nation “totally autonomous of the U.S.,
like Mexico or Canada.”
The CORE director said the Negro
nation would contain 24 million persons
and have a Gross National Product of
$U.S. 40,000 million, larger than that
of many existing countries. Because of
modern technology, Innis pointed out,
the widely scattered components of the
proposed Negro nation would find it
easier to communicate with one another
than the original 13 States did.
Some of the delegates to the confer-
ence (organised by the International
Association for Cultural Freedom)
expressed puzzlement at Innis’ proposal,
which they likened to apartheid. Innis
denied his proposed Negro enclaves
would resemble semi-autonomous native
regions of South Africa, because, he
said, American Negroes have greater
resources and ability than South
Africans, and because the enclaves
would be designed to liberate the black
population from white control. Ameri-
can delegates labelled Innis’ plan
impractical, immoral, or racist.
TRUDEAU'S FIRST SIX
PRIME MINISTER Pierre Trudeau
last week minimised the threat of Ameri-
can domination of the Canadian
economy, in an interview marking his
first six months in office. He said that
Russia dominated some European coun-
tries and Japan dominated some Asian
countries in a similar manner, through
economic investments. “These are facts
of life and they don’t worry me,” he
said. “I think what is more important
is the technology that comes in with
American capital. I am not an economic
nationalist. In the case of American
investments in Canada, I believe it is
more important for us to use our sav-
ings to invest in the future rather than
to use these savings to buy up the past
and try to buy out the American con-
cerns which are here now.
“So I’d like to try to skip a genera-
tion and say, well, they own the auto-
mobile factories and many of the paper-
pulp mills and so on. Let’s not use too
much of our savings trying to make
these things Canadian. Let’s make sure
that the industries of tomorrow will be
Canadian. This is where Canadians can
prove whether they are entrepreneurs
or not, and whether their assessment of
the future is as good as the Americans’.
“But we have limited resources, intel-
lectual and manpower and financial.
Therefore, the great problem for a
government of our size is to know
where we will invest those resources
most resources for protecting our
identity. In most areas I’m prepared
to let the consumer decide and let the
forces of the market play.”
Mr. Trudeau said NATO member-
ship was particularly “useful” to
Canada, because “it permits us to talk
to other people than the United States
when we’re talking about global
military problems . . . for instance, we
can assess the events in Czechoslovakia
or the happenings over Suez or the
developments in Berlin, not merely by
talking to the U.S. but by asking what
the English, French, Italians, and
Germans and all the rest of the NATO
'members think of a given thing.”
However, Mr. Trudeau questioned
“some of the basic premises” obtain-
ing when NATO was created in 1940.
Since then, China had developed into
an important power. He said: “It’s
obvious that Russia’s greatest fear in
the future will be China and not the
U.S. Perhaps there would be something
to be said for the U.S. or for other
members of NATO to act more along
the lines of this new reality. In the
long run, I think, perhaps it is in the
interests of China to be friendly with
America rather than with Russia. And
if you can develop this line of think-
Trudeau. .. among the people
ing, then you cease to be as afraid of
Russia in Europe as we are now. By
the year 2000 Japan will be one of
the greats in the world, along with
Russia, Germany, and the U.S. This is
going to spell out a whole new set
of realities in the Pacific both in the
military and economic sense. I’d be
interested in making sure that Canada,
as a Pacific nation, is asking itself
questions about that.”
Explaining why he liked to get out
and mingle with the public informally,
Trudeau said: “I want people, and
especially students, to understand that

Ifou’ll either envy, or own it.
The Isuzu 1600 Florian. It’s the kind
of car that will make your friends wish
they’d waited. You may feel guilty but
the alternative’s worse. Imagine riding in
someone else’s Florian.
Appearance
Clean, elegant lines. Definitely inter-
national. You can take your Florian any-
where and know you’re being envied.
Square headlamps. Curved glass win-
dows making a beautiful profile. A great
looking car.
Comfort
Inside, the Florian is your kingdom. It
gives you space instead of fitting room.
Space for four envious passengers. And
you. Space for shoulders, legs. Space to
sleep (the bucket front seats fold right
back level with the rear seat). And when
night does fall switches and knobs and
ash trays light up for easy locating. Even
the weather is made to order the fresh
air system operates even when all the
windows are closed. There’s also a 3
speed heater demister for both front and
rear windows. Radio. 2 speed wipers.
And carpet throughout. That’s Prestige.
Quiet
Exceptionally. The Florian is too refined
to intrude on your conversation. You
won’t hear a thing. Not from the engine,
not from the road surface. And the wind
becomes a whisper. The Florian respects
your privacy.
Safety
This is where we boast a little. We must
be the safest car on the road. Its safety
features more than fulfil the stringent U.S.
Government regulations. To name a few
padding of interior and elimination of
sharp protrusions. Child safety catches
on doors. Zone-toughened glass. Very
reassuring.
Maintenance
The Florian does its own. Non-lubrication
joints and brakes with auto-adjustor see
to themselves. The motor is most oblig-
ingly accessible to even the fumble fin-
gered. And the Mitsubishi network in
Australia is huge. So there’s always
someone to answer your questions.
Performance
We saved it till last. 100 m.p.h. But
silently. Your friends will weep. Accelera-
tion oto 1 /4 mile in 16.4 seconds. Vroom!
Other cars in this area can’t do it. Fuel,
42 m.p.g. The Florian doesn’t splash it-
self around. It doesn’t have to.

there is no great authority called the

RUSK ON ISOLATIONISM
ON THE EVE of leaving the office of
Secretary of State, Dean Rusk seemed
last week to be in two minds. On the
one hand he feared changes. On the
other hand he thought that things
would remain the same.
As a change-fearer, his privately
expressed view that the United States
may go “isolationist” under the Nixon
administration received wide publicity.
Rusk believes it would be a “national
disaster” if America moved away from
the collective security arrangements,
such as NATO and SEATO, that have
marked its post-war foreign policy.
“Today there are signs that the lessons
of the past are being ignored,” he said
in a recent speech. “A trend toward
isolationism has appeared, not only in
the United States but in other Western
nations. If we are in the opening stages
of a great debate on the subject of
how to organise a durable peace, I
welcome it. If the idea of collective
security is not a satisfactory answer,
by all means let us find a better one.”
But Mr. Rusk’s fears are qualified
by his other private view — that his
successor as Secretary of State will be
forced by circumstances to follow the
same fundamental policy Rusk carried
out under Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson. He has pointed out to friends
that John Foster Dulles, who served
under President Eisenhower, was criti-
cised for following too closely the
policies of Dean Acheson, Secretary
under President Truman, and that
Rusk himself was attacked for fol-
lowing a “Dulles line” on foreign
policy. Rusk predicted that his suc-
cessor would be similarly criticised.
He believes that the basic fact is
that American world responsibilities
and power drastically limited the free-
dom of action of any Secretary of
State, barring a return to old-fashioned
isolationism. “America cannot flit in
and out of world problems like a hum-
ming-bird, tasting one flower today
and another tomorrow,” he is quoted
as saying.


Black Africa’s guerillas strike from Zambia
THE RARELY mentioned but per-
sistent guerilla war between black
African nationalists and the remaining
white-ruled nations on that continent
has been hotting up lately. It is war-
fare with three objectives South
Africa, Rhodesia, and the Portuguese
territories and, not unn.aturally,
Zambia is in the middle of it, both as
the country being used as a safe refuge
by the guerillas and the possible target
of a white nation’s strike to end the
guerilla menace.
On one prong, the Caprivi Strip, a
narrow corridor of desolate bushland
which juts out from South-West Africa
between Botswana (Bechuanaland) and
Zambia, has become the latest target
of African guerilla fighters in their war
with white-ruled southern Africa. Cross-
ing into the Caprivi Strip from Zambia,
the guerillas—members of the banned
South-West Africa People’s Organisation
(SWAPO) —have been attempting to
recruit support among the local African
population for a planned uprising
against the South African authorities
who control Caprivi directly from
Pretoria.
The South African Government
believes that the Caprivi Strip is being
used as the build-up area for a new
wave of raids on South Africa. About
60 people in the Strip have been
arrested, according to the South
African police, and more arrests are
expected. The Strip, which borders on
Angola, Zambia, Botswana, and
Rhodesia, has a special strategic signifi-
cance. It provides South Africa with
a well-placed base from which to
launch an attack against Zambia and
other black African States if this was
ever decided.
About 16 miles south of the border
with Zambia, at Mpacha, the South
African authorities have established an
extensive air base. Although they
maintain that the base was built as an
emergency landing strip for their own
airline jets which have to make a long
detour round black Africa, the Mpacha
base poses a potentially serious threat
to Zambia’s security as well as playing
a key role in South Africa’s desire
to effectively control the Caprivi Strip.
In the past, guerillas have left the
Strip undisturbed, using it only as a
corridor to reach the main part of
South-West Africa beyond. They
wanted to avoid clashes with South
African security forces too close to the
Zambian border which might embarrass
President Kaunda’s Government. But
the attempts to infiltrate South-West
Africa were unsuccessful. The guerillas
often arrived exhausted after a hazard-
ous journey of several hundred miles on
foot, and quickly fell prey to the wait-
ing South African forces. Those that
used independent Botswana as an entry
route were pursued by the police there
before they even sighted their homeland.
Now, with an upsurge in guerilla
activity all round Zambia’s borders, the
guerillas, less concerned at the danger
of repercussions on Zambia, are ready
to strike at targets more easily within
their reach. Since July, about 30
guerillas have entered the Strip,
according to SWAPO’s office in Lusaka,
to mobilise the sympathetic locals there.
But they have been equipped with few
arms and are poorly trained.
In a second prong, direct conflict
between Zambian and Portuguese forces
is developing along the borders of
Angola and Mozambique as the
guerillas, using Zambia as an entry
route to the Portuguese territories, step
up their operations. In the latest
encounter, a Zambian Army unit on
patrol in the Katete district, not far
from the Mozambique border, opened
fire on Portuguese troops who had
entered Zambia possibly in pursuit
of guerillas or probing for information
Zambia’s
President
Kaunda:
trouble on
all sides
on guerilla movements along the
border. A Portuguese officer was killed
and four other soldiers wounded.
This incident followed a series of
bombing raids and air-reconnaissance
missions which the Portuguese forces
have been carrying out for some time
along the Mozambique and Angola
borders with Zambia. Several Zambian
villages have been destroyed or
damaged. About 12 Zambians have
been killed in these attacks and many
more injured. The Zambian Govern-
ment is becoming increasingly con-
cerned at the ease with which Portu-
guese forces can attack targets in
Zambia without fear of retaliation.
Although the Zambian Army is con-
stantly on the alert along the Mozam-
bique and Angola borders, its forces are
too limited to cope effectively with the
widespread areas which the Portuguese
can invade.
Zambia’s borders with the Portuguese
territories run mainly through remote
and inaccessible bushland for some 850
miles. The Air Force has no combatant
aircraft to deal with the threat of
Portuguese air raids and not even
sufficient planes to keep a regular
watch on border areas. On several
occasions, news of a Portuguese attack
on Zambia has reached the Government
only after a delay of several days.
Zambia is particularly worried at the
number of vulnerable targets in the
country, such as bridges, power lines,
and railways, which the Portuguese
could attack with little difficulty if they
wanted to try to deter Zambia from
lending support to the guerillas.
Both Frelimo and Coremo, the two
Mozambique nationalist organisations,
which have offices in Lusaka, Zambia’s
capital, intend to step up guerilla war-
fare in the north-west area of the coun-
try. In defending the Angola and
Mozambique border areas, the Portu-
guese aim has been to create a depopu-
lated zone along the borders with
Zambia to enable them to catch infil-
trators. On occasions, Zambian villages
have been destroyed in the process, but
the Zambian Government has been able
to do little more than make ineffectual
protests at the United Nations. For this
reason, and because of the threats of
attack from Rhodesia and South Africa,
President Kaunda has been anxious to
acquire either fighter aircraft or ground-
to-air missiles to protect his country.
Finally, a third prong of guerilla
activity thrusts at Rhodesia. The leaders
of the two exiled Rhodesian nationalist
parties which organise guerilla opera-
tions from Zambia are convinced that m>
agreement devised by Mr. Wilson and
Mr. Smith will be acceptable to them,
and they are prepared to carry on with
guerilla tactics against the Rhodesian
authorities indefinitely.
Both the Zimbabwe African People’s
Union (ZAPU) and their rivals, the
Zimbabwe Africa National Union
(ZANU), have written off all hope that
Britain will eventually decide on a solu-
tion which they consider to be just.
They want nothing less than Immediate
majority rule.
The Rhodesian nationalists, however,
are finding difficulty in sustaining the
level of their guerilla activities in
Rhodesia. After three major offensives
in the past 16 months, the size of their
trained guerilla forces has been seriously
depleted. Several hundred guerillas are
believed to have been lost since fighting
started, at first sporadically, in 1966.
Although there are still more cadres
of trained guerillas in the pipeline in
Zambia, Tanzania, or elsewhere, both
ZAPU and ZANU face serious difficul-
ties in keeping up recruitment to meet
their long-term plans for guerilla war-
fare in Rhodesia. With recruitment of
Africans inside Rhodesia for military
training abroad seemingly impossible,
the guerilla movements were forced to
turn to the mainly unwilling Rhodesian
African population living in Zambia as
the most readily available source of
supply. This led to a wave of kidnap-
pings of Rhodesian Africans, and the
black Rhodesian community in Zambia,
numbering over 60,000, became terrified.
The scale of the kidnappings reached
such proportions that the Zambian
Government intervened, deporting 56
members of ZAPU and ZANU to
Tanzania.

FIGHTING
FIRES WITH
SCIENCE
By GEOFFREY PEREGRINE
Aftermath of the Blue Mountains
fires ... burnt-out cars and debris are
tipped into a ditch, all that remains of
90 homes
THE IDEA is simple enough. Use the
technology of “brushfire” war to fight
brushfires themselves. And it seems to
work, too well, that is, outside Aus-
tralia. A startling new range of tech-
niques and equipment is coming into
use in places such as the United States
and Canada to first forest and brush
fires. An incipient blaze is likely to be
picked up first on an infra-red detection
apparatus, deluged within the hour by
gallons of water from the skies, and
finally mopped up by either parachut-
ing “smoke-jumpers” or plain ordinary
firefighters ferried to the spot by heli-
copter.
Earlier this month, looking at the
menacing rush of bushfires near the Blue
Mountains and right into the heart
of Sydney’s North Shore suburbs, these
techniques were once more suggested.
A correspondent of the “Daily Tele-
graph” even suggested converting
RAAF Hercules transports for use as
water-bombers to bring the fires under
control.
The fact that we don’t use these
methods makes us look somewhat back-
ward, as though poor-mouth Australians,
lackadaisical and amateurish, prefer to
remain in the dark-ages of firefighting.
These methods have glamor, appeal.
Why, we even see the rugged smoke-
jumpers on television (or you might if
you stay up for that late, late resurrec-
tion of almost-forgotten Hollywood
indiscretions).
But the analogy of firefighting is war
a similarity that cliches like “brush-
fire war” and “firefighters battling
flames” recognise. If so, let us com-
pare our firefighting efforts with, say,
American efforts in Vietnam. Our
firefighters are amateurs and volun-
teers. American soldiers are largely
conscripted professionals. Our bushfire
officers seek to tackle a fire with strong
manpower in either a lull or at a weak
point like a track or firebreak. Ameri-
can soldiers seek to accomplish their
aims by heavy use of ammunition and
firepower. For us, equipment is scarce
and valuable. Americans use up aero-
planes and helicopters as if they were
going out of fashion.
The important thing is that both sets
of tactics our similarities in war and
firefighting and the American similari-
ties—accomplish their objectives. If a
fire is controllable, we do it. So do the
Americans. But we don’t parachute
smoke-jumpers into the jaws of death.
We don’t deluge from the skies. We
don’t depend on exotic and sensationally
sensitive infra-red detectors. We find
the human eye, particularly when edu-
cated, more discriminating and practi-
cal.
Our tactics are based on our condi-
tions, our resources, and our tempera-
ment. The Americans and the Cana-
dians base their tactics on exactly the
same circu'mstances as they apply to
them. It then follows that what is good
and works in America doesn’t neces-
sarily apply here. That is lesson one.
Let us clear our minds of films and
spectaculars and inapplicable garbage.
Let us look at the work being done on
bushfires in Australia and the way we
can adapt and use these techniques in
our conditions.
Our bushfires are more dangerous
than most of those that occur in the
northern latitude pine forests. The
North American fires burn much slower,
with less intensity. The explosive blow-
up conditions that we know so well
here do not exist in these regions,
around and approaching 50 degrees
north. Even in the brush areas of
Southern California and the forests of
the southern United States, where temp-
eratures are much war’mer, the volatiles
and “fuel” which exist in an Australian
forest are not found.
You can measure these fire-danger
variables and assign numerical values
to all of them. These show, for instance,
that a fire situation can be six times
more of a hazard in the Australian bush
than in a Canadian forest. Reported
observations show that a typical Cana-
dian fire, starting at a point, will burn
comparatively slowly for some time.
After half an hour, the fire will have
spread to about a tenth of an acre. In
Australian heat-wave “blow-up” condi-
tions, with high temperatures and strong
winds, fires have been observed to
“crown” (that is to rush through the
treetops at express-train speeds) within
six minutes and to have engulfed 1000
acres within that first vital half hour.
These sample observations are just
one aspect of bushfire research in Aus-
tralia. This work is centred on the
Commonwealth Institute of Timber and
Forest Research in Canberra, the State
Forestry Departments, and various uni-
versities, some of which are associated
with specialised aspects. Monash, for
instance, is interested zoologically in
the ecology of the fire environment.
Most of the Government forestry
bodies have “protection” divisions with
professional officers concerned to vary-
ing degrees from basic research into the
behaviour of bushfires down to the
applied technological level of develop-
ing and testing new forms of equipment.
The field is not a big one, but its
importance seems to be officially recog-
nised and it is building up its own body
of tradition and disciplines.
Mr. G. A. McArthur, of the Canberra
Institute, estimates that in addition to-
the full-time professional science gradu-
ates already engaged in the field in
each State, there are probably 30 or 40
young scientists co'ming into the field.
/ Mr. McArthur, in Canberra, and Mr.
Athol Hodgson, of the Victorian
Forestry Department, are recognised
authorities internationally and have
been consulted by international bodies
and organisations, particularly in the
United States. The combination of
Australian conditions and temperament
has established us as a world leader in
this field of research. When, these
people make judgments and recom-
mendations, they not only deserve a
hearing from Governments and the
public; it must be assumed that until
proved otherwise their judgments and


recommendations are the best available
in the Australian environment.
This applies, particularly, to the
brochuremanship and propaganda of
the pedlars of instant panaceas like
water-bombing. Massive water-bombing
and the use of aircraft do work in North
America, particularly, in Canada. But
under present conditions and “state of
the art,” it would have no measurable
effect in large-scale fires in Australia
and would cost tremendous amounts of
money. These could far better be used
for basic strengthening of our
traditional firefighting organisation.
There is a case, however, for the
use of aircraft in very specialised
instances in Australia, and, as in so
many other things, Victoria is pointing
the way to this. We have also pioneered
new forms of using aircraft in what is
known as a “hazard-reduction pro-
gram,” which has attracted world-wide
attention and will probably be adopted
in other countries (with little acknow-
ledgement given to its originators in
this country).
The major proponents of water-
bombing in Australia are the agents
for the manufacturers who make these
aircraft, and as they propose Canadian
solutions for Australian problems it’s
best to look at how aircraft are used
in this capacity in Canada.
Despite what we have heard to the
contrary, there is no unanimous body
of opinion on the best form of water-
bombing aircraft in North America. A
paper published earlier this year by
J. Knox Hawkshaw, Chief Engineer of
the Field Aviation Company of Malton,
Ontario, is an advocate of the small
load, accurately placed. He recommends
450 gallons at a time. On the other
hand, Paul Gagnon, of the Department
of Transport and Communications in
the neighboring Province of Quebec,
quotes the findings of computer models
of fires to suggest that the optimum
load is 1000 gallons. In fact, he says
(in the same publication): “If an air-
craft with a capacity of less than 600
gallons is used, a number of fires would
be left out of control; that is, they
would not be under control after eight
hours.”
Possibly influencing these individual
viewpoints is the fact that Hawkshaw’s
company does fire-bombing conversions
of the smaller Twin Otter while Gag-
non’s experience is in the conversion
of the familiar Catalina flying-boat and
the recommendation of the new CL2IS
utility amphibian. It is the CL2IS that
Is recommended for our trial use here,
at a lease cost of something like
$34,000 an aircraft a month.
In the Canadian environment, this
new aircraft is an undoubted success.
It could well find a use here eventu-
ally, particularly if it is able to be
used for most of the time on some
other form of service, such as trans-
port or “utility” operation. But
the key to its success, very plainly, is
not the quality of the aircraft. It is in
the Canadian environment.
Again I quote Gagnon: “Although
there is a shortage of roads in Quebec,
A Canso amphibian plane releases 800 gallons of water during a fire in Quebec
Province, Canada
the same does not apply to water. One
study has shown that there is a
90 percent probability of finding a lake
1.5 miles long within seven miles of
an.y point in the Province.”
Some estimates make the same claim
for N.S.W. and Victoria, or rather,
being more general, saying that “suit-
able bodies of water are located within
ten miles of any fire point.” My
research on this, while it has been
limited to a ruler and an oil company
map, shows this claim to be fairly
unlikely. While the Australian claim is
a rather good example of brochure-
manship as opposed to a scientific
evaluation, it doesn’t stand up for long
if you add a few conditions:
1. In a drought year (fires don’t show
the consideration of breaking out when
large bodies of water are available
from natural or artificial sources).
2. Offering safe operation. A big
dam in a valley surrounded by high
mountains is a flying risk that we do
not permit in Australia. Similarly, the
open ocean is a pretty hairy place for
seaplanes when they are expected to
operate in the gusting 40-knot winds
that are typical of a fire emergency.
3. At approximately the same level.
It’s not much point depending on a
distance claim of ten or 12 miles when
you have to operate from sea level and
then lift a 12,0001 b. load up and over
a 2500 ft. ridge to bomb a fire in a
deep valley just behind the crest. Your
flying time is equivalent to a far, far
greater distance.
The secret to the operation of these
big water-bombers lies in their ability
to make repeated runs over a small
fire outbreak, dropping the equivalent
of a 1200-gallon water-tanker on each
run. The first essential is being only
minutes away from the water source.
The second is that it has low
approaches so that the aircraft can
come in at a flat angle, skim the sur-
face at 70 knots or so to load the
water, take off again within less than
1000 ft., be over the fire again within
minutes, and dump the load from a
fairly low height.
The designers of the CL2IS and the
water-bombing conversions of the De
Havilland Beaver and Otter range have
developed an inspired way of doing this.
The water is stored in tanks in the
main hull of the CL2IS and in float
conversions of the De Havilland aircraft.
They do not “land” on the lake surface
as they pick up a fresh load, but merely
skim it without settling. A retractable
probe scoops up the water and pulls
back automatically when the tank is
filled to a predetermined level.
Over the fire, the bottom of either the
CL2IS hull or the De Havilland aircraft
floats is snapped open and the water
inside falls in a carefully designed
pattern for accurate aiming and maxi-
mum effect.
In the tank, the water can be auto-
matically mixed with chemical agents-
designed to assist the action of the water
in specific burns. For instance, there’s
a napalm-like jelling agent which clings
to leaves and branches and increases
the effective life of the water employed.
There’s also a wetting agent available to
carry the water quickly through a forest
mat of pine needles to a deep-seated
fire. Monsanto Chemicals have also
developed a fire-retarding agent called
Phoschek, which should also be capable
of use in this fashion. This agent is
the one that is arousing interest in
Australia.
Apart from the logistics of finding
water handy, the main thing that
nullifies water-bombing in Australia is
the rapid spread and intensity of our
fires. A Canadian fire typically spreads
over a tenth of an acre in the first half
hour, while an Australian fire can
reach 1000 acres in the same time under
fire - emergency conditions. During
typical weather, there will also be a
high wind, and this disperses water
dropped from the air, reducing its
effectiveness.
If you want to experiment yourself
without putting up $34,000, try a simu-
lation of the possible effectiveness.


Figure showing water-pick-up operation by the Canso amphibian plane used in
Canada. The operation takes about 15 seconds
Choose an area about seven yards by
seven yards of inflammable dried grass
and gumleaves. Set this alight on a
dry day (and you might be risking a
$4OO fine here, so stand by with a high-
pressure garden hose). As the fire starts
spreading, come in upwind against it
and drop a dessertspoonful of water on
it from a height of about a foot and
carried from a bucket about ten yards
or so away. Just keep carrying and
dropping and watch what happens.
This doesn’t give you an exact simu-
lation, but you do get some idea of
the problems. You will find that when
you have acquired some skill you can
put the fire out if you hit it within
seconds of lighting and very accurately.
But when it has the wind behind it and
is racing across your little area you
just won’t be in the race. And chances
are that unless you lace your trial area
with kerosine it won’t be nearly as
inflammable as 100,000 acres of Aus-
tralian bush after two years of drought,
with bark curled off the trees by 100-
degree heat and battered by a 20-knot
westerly.
Fire-bombing is also carried out in
the United States under somewhat
different conditions, and these have
more application in Australia. The
Americans use mainly land aircraft,
often converted World War II types,
and drop fairly heavy loads of chemicals
like retardants to try to control the
spread of fires within minutes of their
first being spotted. Ground parties can
either go in or be parachuted in to mop
up. But although the American brush
often has a much faster burning rate
than the Canadian forest (particularly
in the Los Angeles area) it is still not
as serious as the Australian bush com-
bustibility.
The Canadians and Americans have
also come up with some interesting
ideas for fire location and detection.
These depend on the detection of infra-
red radiation, the invisible light waves
that come from hot objects. Vietnam
and satellite reconnaissance have seen an
outstanding leap forward in the develop-
ment of these devices. A unit mounted
in a high-speed patrolling jet plane at
35,000 ft. can pick up hot areas in
forests even before they burst into
flames. Cigarettes and points of fire
like matches are a sitting duck.
The big advantage of these is in
areas like the Los Angeles basin, where
the smog that develops during periods
of fire-danger weather makes visual
detection of fire difficult or impossible.
In all that exhaust haze, you just can’t
see a specific “smoke.” The airborne
alarm system, covering the whole of a
mountain range, provides that vital
early warning.
Both the Americans and the Can-
adians also use infra-red photographs
and viewers in direct firefighting appli-
cations. These can penetrate smoke
and haze and show clearly where the
fire front is located. More importantly,
it will also reveal in the smoke and
confusion if a burning brand has been
swept forward of the main front and is
causing a spot fire. This situation not
only multiplies the spread of a big blaze
but also threatens lives of those likely to
be trapped between two fires.
We in Australia have developed and
used similar equipment. At this stage
our experts consider we do not need it
for detection, so they have used a
different-frequency “window.” Lookouts
and volunteer observers spot outbreaks
as quickly as any airborne surveillance
system could do so. But infra-red
observation has already proved its worth
in firefighting. Last year at a big out-
break near Myrtleford, the Victorian
Forestry organisation located a major
spot outbreak ahead of the main fire at
a critical time and controllers were
able to send crews to the scene to grab
it before it got out of control. From
now on, infra-red will be a confirmed
weapon in the hands of our firefighters,
at least in Victoria.
If we don’t plan to use large-scale
water-bombing, if we have our doubts
about infra-red detection in what
way is our science and technological
effort aiding the fight against bushfires?
Our work is in three specific fields:
1. Basic fire-behaviour research.
2. Prevention.
3. Operations.
Research has also indicated a fourth
area which crosses several disciplines
the cyclical nature of Australia’s
weather. Apart from bushfires, this also
has important bearing on weather
research generally, on agriculture, and
probably in every aspect of our national
life to some degree or other.
Weather cycles were once tremen-
dously fashionable. They are still seen
in the long-range forecasts put out from
Crohamhurst Observatory in Queens-
land by Lennox Walker, a disciple of
Inigo Jones. These are officially scoffed
at, but many individuals and organisa-
tions still think enough of the long-
range cyclical forecasts to back Walker
with a little money. Crohamhurst has
amassed a wide range of Australian
weather records and represents a
tradition that has persisted in this
country.
Now, in a few backrooms mainly,
cyclical weather studies are coming
back into prominence. The feeling seems
to be that if only our records extended
back far enough and could be exhaus-
tively analysed by computers, the
cyclical nature would become apparent.
It’s not a matter of saying that every
X years bushfire conditions will occur.
McArthur, in Canberra, points to a
major cycle of 13 years west of the
Divide in N.S.W. and 11 years east of
the Divide. However, on top of this are
various shorter cycles and possibly
much longer phases as well.
When we begin to understand these
and plot them, we will probably be
able to look ahead to a period when
a number of cycles will coincide, point-
ing to a year of maximum danger.
We could then plan ahead organisa-
tionally and, by using preventive
measures, lessen the danger at these
times. Don’t for a moment think that
we will be able to look ahead and
say: “1998 will be a terrible year for
fires.” We might, however, be able to
say that: “In 1998 we can expect the
climax of several dry months following
a build-up of fuel in good years. There
is a probability of serious fires under
these conditions.”
And this, in fact, is what our experts
did do for 1968—only, of course, over
a much shorter range of time. Fire
authorities and the Government went
on record with predictions of severe
outbreaks this year. They were disas-
trously right.
The second field is prevention.
Ideally, we should be able to impress
on Australians that they and not nature
cause most of the fires and motivate
our people to take more care. Chances
are that by spending more time and
money on education we can make
people more fire-conscious.
But the ultimate origin of this
year’s mountain fires in N.S.W. was
almost certainly inexpert burning-off
some months ago, and we have to ask
why these people burned-off round their
homes and farms. We can minimise the
future danger from these areas by not
allowing individuals to have the right
to burn off and by operating not by the
calendar but only after a careful study
of bush and weather conditions.
This field, called “Controlled Hazard
Reduction,” marks our biggest contribu-
tion to the science and art of bushfire


research and control. The theory, obvi-
ous to anyone who has been in the
bush over the past few months in the
coastal areas, is that a huge build-up
of vegetation has followed rain in recent
years. This dried out during the drought
months to become what the experts call
“fuel.” The body of scientific opinion
in Australian bushfire research holds
that we should destroy this fuel by
controlled burning-off months ahead of
times when we can expect serious fire
threats.
It is in fact being tried and it does
work. The key example this year is an
area of 25,000 acres experimentally
burned last May near Bega. In the
N.S.W. South Coast holocaust, this area
has been the one to escape. The vulner-
able towns of the district have not been
threatened. Similar burns took place
earlier this year in Victoria and Western
Australia.
Our people have made a close study
of this technique and have developed
many refinements, which only now are
being taken up in other parts of the
world. The 'most interesting of these is
the use of aircraft for really big burns.
Burning can obviously be done only
when conditions are exactly right. The
object is to remove the fuel some of
the bush-floor litter and the build-up of
scrub between the big trees. Conditions
have to be such that the fire will do
just this and no more, that it will not
become wild and race away, and also
that it will not burn out the material
to be removed.
In the aerial technique, experts care-
fully observe the target area measuring
the combustibility of the bush and
weather conditions. When their figures
show conditions are right (and one of
the products of basic Australian re-
search has been that guesswork has been
removed), they plot exact flight lines
over the area. A light aircraft like a
Cessna flies over these at fairly low
height and observers drop out small,
cheap incendiaries to start a number
of fires at exact intervals. The incen-
diaries, incidentally, are like giant
matches, about seven inches long, with
a striking head, a slow fuse, and a ball
of 'matchhead material where the
wooden stick normally would be.
These “point” fires spread down-
wind until each little fire runs into
an area that another has burned out,
stops, and goes out. In this way, a
small team can cover thousands of
acres a day, burning out the dangerous
fuel. The technique has aroused a
scream from the fundamentalists of
conservation who hold that fires should
always be kept out of an area. But
the preventive-fire advocates say the
Australian bush, in fact, is a fire
environment and without fire coming
through regularly it degenerates.
“You have a choice,” one research
worker told me. “Either you have a
really serious hot and wild fire every
ten or 12 years or you have a cooler
and less harmful one every five or
so. Which is likely to do the least
damage to native plants and wildlife?”
Visiting American conservationist
Edwin Komarek, of Tallahassee,
Florida, brought the controversy into
the open during a recent Melbourne
interview on “This Day Tonight.” He
said fire was a natural part of the Aus-
tralian bush and most of our plants
and animals had, in fact, adapted to
it. “This controlled kind of fire is
not detrimental to wildlife, but is
beneficial,” he said. “Professional con-
servationists realise now that fire is
an essential tool. But amateurs feel all
fire is bad. Fire is an integral part of
wildlife management.”
Komarek went a lot further than
Australian workers have so far publicly
done. But Australian observations have
shown that the bigger animals like
wallabies and kangaroos have an
instinctive, perhaps genetic, under-
standing of fire. They can size up a
fire situation and escape being trapped.
And, of course, in a relatively slow
and “cool” preventive fire, they have
a much better chance than in a raging
“wild” one.
Smaller animals can take refuge in
logs or tree trunks. During periods of
controlled burning, these are usually
damp and safe. Insects burrow beneath
the forest litter. Only the very top
layer is burned or scorched and obser-
vations only a fraction of an inch below
the surface have not shown any disturb-
ance when a fire of this sort has passed.
Scorch height is limited to about 10ft.,
so tree animals and birds survive.
As for plants, many of these depend
on fire for regeneration. Some species
have fireproof seeds and need a burn
to allow them to grow.
In Victoria, this problem of the effect
of controlled burning on the bush
ecology is under fairly intensive study.
Only disinterested scientific observation
and measurement can show whether the
fire school is right in all respects, but
the evidence is mounting that controlled
fire reduction of fuel hazards, to give
the program its full title, offers the
best way of protection from horrors
like those of the present year.
Research into actual firefighting,
development of new techniques and
improvement of old offers another way
of benefiting Australian efforts. Despite
the lack of enthusiasm which water-
bombing has met here, the technique
has not been ignored in Australia. The
Victorians advocate using Phoschek
bombing in specific cases, such as hand-
ling fires caused by lightning in remote
areas. Observations have shown that a
single storm can cause up to 75 light-
ning strikes.
These do not race away in their early
stages, particularly if the storms have
accompanied a cool change and brought
some rain (one wonders, if the
preventive-fire-school people are right
and fire is part of the Australian bush
environment, was lightning the origin
of natural preventive fires). Often
it could take a land party some hours
to penetrate to the place where the
fire had started and completely extin-
guish it. Spot bombing with retardant
holds it back to buy this time.
The Victorians are using land air-
craft, usually converted crop-dusters
which are generally based near the
threatened areas. To improve efficiency,
they have built landing strips in three
key places (including one at 5200 ft.,
claimed to be the highest on the Aus-
tralian mainland). Phoschek installa-
tions are ready at each.
The Victorians also put aircraft up
for visual spotting during periods of
maximum fire danger and, of course,
during the outbreaks. A fire chief has
aircraft laid on, just like water-tankers
or back-up facilities like camp kitchens
or reserves of men. A helicopter is also
on permanent charter during the
summer. This mobility is of the utmost
value during tactical firefighting
situations, particularly when the infra-
red viewer is available to penetrate
smoke.
Authorities in several States believe
aircraft will increasingly be used for
pinpoint fire control, for spotting, and
for ferrying men and supplies. Troop-
carrying helicopters, as used in Vietnam,
could put sections of firefighters to
within half a mile of a young outbreak
within minutes and these minutes
are critical. They would also allow more
efficient mopping up, for instance in the
situation which occurred in N.S.W. last
week. The fire had been beaten back
from populated areas but still burned
in inaccessible spots. During lulls, men
could have been lifted in and whisked
out of danger if the weather looked
like becoming dangerous again. On
foot, as it involves movements of several
hours, it’s just too risky to march men
into deep valleys to “black out”
surviving flame pockets. This helicopter
function could well be a responsibility
of the RAAF and possibly the Army.
It is also likely to be the only con-
dition under which a standing corps
of professional firefighting specialists
could be used in Australia. Mainten-
ance and deployment of, say, 1000
men, would be far beyond the
resources of any State. But airlifting of
specialised volunteers for this mopping-
up phase and as a mobile relief could
well provide a valuable reserve.
If the Commonwealth Government
is interested in major Australian prob-
lems, it could make seed money avail-
able for specific studies and possibly
men and equipment as standby
reserves in emergencies. I would
recommend two areas for funds:
1. A full investigation of the con-
trolled burning program, including its
ecology and an indication from the
best available sources of its long-term
effects.
2. A long-range program to gather
and evaluate cyclical data.
Neither of these by any stretch of
the imagination can be said to be a
State responsibility. They need to be
met by the nation as a whole. For
expenditure likely to be well under a
quarter of a million dollars, they offer
the chance for understanding, control,
and, above all, management of our
Australian bushfire problem.


SYDNEY’S SECOND SYDNEY?
By DENIS O'BRIEN
WHEN Barry Wilde went to live at
Parramatta 18 years ago, he liked the
green that was around him, and the
fresher air, and the comfortable sense
of separateness that Parramatta had.
He still has an unshakable devotion
for the place; has served it as an aider-
man for the past nine years, and has
been Mayor for the past two. But
he now rationalises the depreciation of
original virtues. That there is less green
to be seen is, he says, the price of pro-
gress; true, Parramatta now suffers
occasionally from smog, but the prob-
lem is not as bad as it is in Sydney;
separating Parramatta from Sydney’s
western sprawl might be difficult for
the uninitiated eye, but not for those
who guard its identity.
The trouble is that Parramatta has
never quite been able to grow from
Australia’s second oldest settlement into
a distinguishably attractive entity. It
has become a city in local government
terms, but a large, traffic-strangled
outer suburb in character. Always a
satellite of Sydney, it is now being
drawn on State Planning Authority
maps as a sort of second Sydney before
it is even a distinctive Parramatta.
In the SPA’s Outline Plan for the
Sydney region between 1970 and 2000,
Parramatta becomes a critical compon-
ent of the “closely related urban com-
plex” to extend from Newcastle to Wol-
longong. It is vital to the proposed
north-south “communications corridor”
linking Newcastle, Gosford-Wyong,
Campbelltown, and Wollongong, is
drawn as a new urban centre servicing
a. population of 500,000 or more, and
has the responsibility of easing the pres-
sure on Sydney by siphoning thousands
of white-collar workers out of the city.
Reconciling that small part of the
SPA’s grand plan with the reality of
Parramatta’s knotted development over
Proposals by the Planning Authority
in N.S.W. envisage a population of
7,000,000 living between Newcastle and
Wollongong by the year 2000. One of
the areas involved in the necessary
urban expansion is Parramatta.
the past 179 years falters when you con-
sider the “how” of it all. Just about any
projection for the development and
expansion of Newcastle and Wollongong
is easily conceivable. They have recog-
nisable form as cities and each has
built-in growth potential. It is possible,
too, to visualise an urban centre rising
out of Gosford-Wyong; anywhere with
space to spare comfortably accommo-
dates the visionary scheme. But, in
practical terms, it is difficult to see
Parramatta being shaped as a major
urban centre on an expressway to some-
where else—and at the same time keep-
ing what individuality it has left as the
city of Parramatta.
The State Planning Authority Outline
Plan has been motivated by increasingly
urgent necessity. Unless Sydney is to
break down under the weight of popu-
lation, it must break out. Yet of all
the Sydney region areas mapped out
to take the overflow, Parramatta alone
looks as if it will be smudged into a
Sydney megalopolis in contributing its
convenient geography to the solution.
Perhaps that is the price of its failure
to assert its character over the years.
Without investing the State Planning
Authority’s rather hazy script for Parra-
matta with too much literal significance,
it is not easy to find where the planners
have really felt the pulse of the place,
taken more than token account of its
history, or considered it in such sym-
pathetically detailed terms as some
of the new dormitories it will serve.
These are the three paragraphs which
outline the future Parramatta in the
Authority’s report:
“Parramatta will be near the geo-
graphical centre of the enlarged Sydney
urban area, and at a focal point on
the communications system. It has
played a historic role in Sydney’s
foundation and development. It is the
most important shopping centre outside
the metropolitan centre.
“It is proposed that steps be taken
to expand the Parramatta centre to
become a very major [sic] commercial
employment centre. It is proposed to
encourage the location there of regional
uses such as major hospitals and other
institutions in order to reinforce the
role which the centre is expected to
play in the future. An expansion in
office employment of the order of
50,000 has been adopted as a desirable
objective.
“This proposal will require compre-
hensive planning and redevelopment
calling for boldness, imagination,
vigorous action, and the utmost
co-operation from local interests, the
local council, and others concerned, if
it is to succeed. The consequential
changes to the communications system
to improve the approaches to the new
Parramatta city centre have still to be
further studied and defined.”
Neither Parramatta past nor present
is much apparent among that prose.
The picture of the future is evocative
of high-rising concrete people
using Parramatta for what they can get
out of it. The proposals are not neces-
sarily bad simply because they suit
a purpose, but it is a pity that the
progress mapped for Parramatta seems
only to order a change from the cir-
Parramatta today ... grace,
ugliness, traffic strangulation,
and generations of unpainted
carelessness


cumstantially bad to the necessitously
better without a pause for consideration
of character.
At noon, in the middle of the Great
Western Highway where it becomes a
junction of Parramatta’s main shopping
thoroughfare, it might be impossible
to believe that change could do
anything but good for the place. All
of Australia’s urban traffic problems
appear to be there in microcosm.
Parramatta was the first planned town
in Australia, but that dubious advan-
tage was long ago skittled by the com-
bustion engine. Chaotic is probably too
strong a word to describe the result of
too many motor vehicles using Parra-
matta’s horse-and-buggy roads. Intol-
erable is better. For the sake of its
survival, Parramatta should have been
by-passed years ago. Now, all of its
debits its claustrophobic ethos, its
only casual regard for its history, its
straggling untidiness, its failure to rise
distinctively from the surrounding
sprawl all of them are compounded
by the fact that Parramatta stands in
the middle of an arterial route between
Sydney and the west.
Clogged as it is by transients, Parra-
matta seems more a place to escape
from than live in or meander through.
It is still rich with a heritage of early
Colonial buildings, but it is becoming
more and more difficult to sense that
here was where Governor Phillip, in
1788, planted the first inland settlement
to grow food for the hungry convicts
and marines on Sydney Cove. Or
where Macarthur established the Aus-
tralian wool industry. Or where James
Ruse harvested the colony’s first wheat
crop.
Such historical abstracts are only
ever truly evoked by atmosphere. And
Parramatta is becoming short on
historical atmosphere. Not even its
legacy of brick, stone, and mortar is
quite enough to represent the import-
ance of its past. Its history isn’t
attractively set-off. Too many of the
relevantly old buildings have to be
searched for without much help from
signposts. When they are arrived at
they seem to be either fiercely displayed
or accidentally preserved. Lancer Bar-
racks, Australia’s oldest military estab-
lishment still in use, is shadowed by a
characteristically drab and ugly
Australian railway station and has to
struggle to keep its significance among
backstreet buildings; the National
Trust has painstakingly preserved
Experiment Farm in Ruse Street, but
the surrounding concrete is too care-
fully overdone; Hambledon, a house
once occupied by Penelope Lucas, a
governess brought from England for
Macarthur’s daughters, looks to have
been renovated out of historical
context. Only St. John’s Church, in
the heart of the city, seems to stand
as a comfortable survivor of the
Colonial days, and if Parramatta ever
had the chance to redress its
unattractive faults it might well take
its key from the pleasant mixture of
modern retailing and Colonial grace
that surrounds St. John’s.
As the State Planning Authority has,
almost parenthetically, stated, the
accomplishment of the redevelopment
proposals involving Parramatta calls for
boldness, imagination, vigorous action,
and the utmost co-operation from
just about everybody. When planners
talk like that, one is tempted to re-
examine the feasibility of their plans.
But Parramatta is not entirely
without willingness or the signs of self-
help. Macquarie Street has begun to
acquire a tastefully dressed facade; an
architect in Marsden Street has most
skilfully shamed surrounding careless-
ness by making the gracious best of an
old two-storey house; the new David
Jones’ store puts a smoothly soothing
side to a quiet stretch of the Parra-
matta River; Fred Smale, the city’s
chief engineer and town planner, talks
freely of the need for a pleasant
environment, and has begun opening
up the congested commercial heart of
Parramatta with the hope one day of
having shopping plazas closed to traffic.
None of this, though, is immediately
relevant to the Parramatta envisaged by
the SPA, any more than the State Gov-
ernment’s proposal to put a $4O million
hospital there is likely to make Parra-
matta a better place to live.
Right from the beginning, the man-
made environment at Parramatta has
been slowly diminishing the virtues of
the river setting. For all the proud
“firsts” it has contributed to Australian
history there is something forbidding
about its legacy of grim architecture
to house the criminal, the recalcitrant,
and the mentally ill. The jail, the
home for delinquent girls, and the
sprawl of mental care and rehabilita-
tion buildings seem somehow to have
influenced generations of development
there. It is as if the presence of
hardship and misfortune has engen-
dered a sort of puritanical ugliness
a puritanism which has drifted into
unpainted carelessness down the
generations. Only when the jacarandas
bloom in November is Parramatta
softened. Then, little old streets like
Fleet Street, which neighbors the
jail and the North Parramatta psychi-
atric centre, become mellowed in the
way that Parramatta never has in all
its 180 years.
Stabbed through as it is by main
roads to somewhere else and lying at
the western end of Sydney’s heavy
exhaust, there doesn’t seem much that
Parramatta can do for itself before
the State Planning Authority’s hard-
edged vision for its future becomes a
reality. Yet there are efforts being
made. Town planner Smale is trying,
for instance, to improve the river fore-
shore not only to make it more
beautiful, but to open up more of it
for public use than is now easily
available. The scheme was prepared for
Parramatta by the University of New
South Wales School of Architecture and
Building and proposes to transform
hundreds of acres of foreshore east of
Rosehill racecourse, but it stays as a
plan because the sort of selfless
co-operation which the SPA insists is
necessary for a better Sydney region is
baulked by the tenancy of a variety of
public service departments: the Navy,
curiously enough, has a depot standing
on a large part of the foreshore, and
refuses to budge.
And Parramatta’s own town plan,
which might have encouraged a more
personal concern for the place if it
had been enforced when it was drawn
several years ago, still awaits the State
Government’s approval. Still, Mr.
Smale endeavors to work effectively
within his limitations. His office looks
down on a civic square which is a little
raw but has space to breathe; his finger
points to ugliness which must be
checked “Those hoardings . . . they
should never have been allowed”
and to an environment improving
simply by the widening of a street here
and a street there.
Parramatta’s shop and office woik-
force is increasing independent of the
SPA’s scheme; all the Outline Plan
can really do is stimulate its accelera-
tion. The AMP Society, the Common-
wealth Tax and Social Service Depart-
ments, and the State Government
Insurance Office all have moved large
administrative staffs into the city in
recent years; the foundations are going
down for a 12-storey $5 million
building for the Prospect County
Council. The development gives the
city a share in the sense of an expand-
ing Australia, but doesn’t altogether
reduce the harshness of the place.
Ultimately, all consideration of
Parramatta’s preservation and improve-
ment comes back to the problem of
the inadequate roads which threaten
to strangle it.
Mayor Barry Wilde dwells on the
problem, has an intimate knowledge of
it. Five days a week he commutes from
Northmead, Parramatta’s northern
next-door neighbor, to Sydney, where
he works in a bank. In broad terms he
is one of the State Planning Authority’s
thousands who somehow have to be
moved out of Sydney.
“As a local government we now have
a responsibility to see that the desires
expressed in the Parramatta aspect of
the Outline Plan are not frustrated,” he
says. “We now have to consider a high
policy approach to the question of
adapting ourselves to the situation.
But we need a better roads system. It
is now essential that State Highway
13 be deviated away from the centre
of Parramatta to permit commercial
development. At present, State highway
traffic goes straight through our heart.
And although the cost will be substan-
tial, it is essential that the County
roads system is designed to bypass
traffic around Parramatta. And we
will need loan funds to put at least
two more bridges across the river.”
In themselves such demands sound
selfish, but without their satisfaction
Parramatta, by the year 2000, will be
not so much a city, more a graveyard
of misspent opportunities.


These barrels hold the reasons
whv Mildara Three Star Brandy
will taste the same this year,
next year, even ten years hence.
Fine Brandy is the sum of many different factors. The quality of
the original grapes. The skill of the distiller. The type of still.
The cask oak. The time of ageing. And, above all, the skill
of the blender. He subtly blends brandies of varying
ages to produce a consistent style which will not
change from year to year. Barrel One for example,
was laid down in 1936. Barrel Two in 1944,
Barrel Three, 1950, Barrel Four,
1961, Barrel Five, 1963 and Barrel
Six, 1966, the youngest spirit
allowed by Excise. There are many
other brandies of differing years
which, with the Blender’s art,
produce Mildara Three Star
Brandy. Consistently good, no
matter when you buy it.

The splinter that grew into a tree
Senator Byrne
Senator Gair
Senator Little
By PETER SAMUEL
WHEN REMINISCING, DLP Federal
Secretary Jack Kane now admits he
once suspected that the Labor men
were right when they said that the
DLP had no political future and would
quickly wither away. But DLP men no
longer talk in terms of mere survival.
They have broken out of the ghetto.
Now they talk the politics of advocacy
and influence.
Suddenly the DLP is at the centre
of things in Canberra. The Leader,
Senator Gair, complains he cannot get
a moment to himself in his office in,
Parliament House from the constant
stream of visitors: Government or
Labor Party MPs coming to do deals,
deputations of lobbyists, journalists.
The opportunity for this newly purpose-
ful political activity is the strategic
position the DLP has won in the Senate.
Even in 1967, as a two-man team, it
swung a great deal of weight. It took
the initiative in preventing the Govern-
ment prematurely raising unpopular
postal charges before the Budget. Com-
bining with Independents and the
Labor Party, it forced the Government
through the agonising process of com-
ing clean, on its use of VIP planes.
And it gathered political kudos by
being Opposition to a Government-
ALP coalition move to amend the
Constitution to break the “nexus” so
that the House of Representatives
could be expanded without enlarging
the Senate. But the great accomplish-
ment of the year was in doubling its
numbers to four with strong votes in
Victoria and Queensland, giving it a
true balance of power in the Senate.
And yet it has not been the use of
this power which has forced attention
on the DLP most recently; it has been
the DLP’s new criticism of the Liberal
Prime Minister and its move toward a
selective preference policy in, elections.
During the months of August, Septem-
ber, and October when Mr. Gorton
encouraged speculation to continue
that he would call an early election,
the DLP took the running from the
Labor Party as the key opposition
element. The DLP got more attention
an.d publicity in those few months than
ever before in its history. It called the
shots in a protracted war of nerves
against an election, and it won. An
angry Prime Minister, admitting defeat,
said he greatly missed the opportunity
of a fight with the DLP. Outsmarted,
his emotions made him want to punish
the DLP for having thwarted his plans.
He felt humiliated. But his rational
political judgment told him he couldn’t
afford elections as an exercise in
retribution against the DLP.
What Mr. Gorton’s colleagues were
telling him during the decisive week in
mid-October was that the DLP swings
a great deal of weight at House of
Representatives elections, even though
it cannot get any of its men elected.
It wields this power partly through its
propaganda. The Government Parties
have so long left it to the DLP to
make the really telling points against
the Labor Party that they have for-
gotten (or never learnt) how to make
them themselves. They have tended to
adopt the pose of being above the
political struggle, leaving it to the DLP
to discredit the ALP, or, as they often
put it, tip the can. However much it
may make intellectual sophisticates
wince, it is a fact that a vast majority
of Australian voters see “Communism”
as a danger B9 percent is the latest
survey figure and it has been the
DLP which has done a disproportionate
amount of the propaganda spadework
in linking the ALP with Communism
in the minds of electors. Unity tickets
at home and neutralist, retractionist
policies abroad have been driven home
to the electorate as a threat to Austra-
lian. security.
Through every medium—television,,
radio, pamphlets, newspaper ads, and
public meetings—the DLP has said
loudly and clearly, in the past, that the
Labor Party cannot be trusted. They
have repeatedly got the Government
half a million preference votes, many
of which have been decisive in electing
Government Members, and they have
also won an unknown number of
primary votes for the Government. At
different times between ten and twenty
Government parliamentarians have
owed their seats to DLP preferences,
and it was the intention of the DLP,
just recently, to redirect some of its
preferences selectively away from Gov-
ernment candidates which made an
election impossible for the Prime
Minister. He couldn’t afford the risk
of an early election at which he might


throw away half the Government’s
majority in the House of
Representatives.
The immediate reasons for the DLP’s
survival as a force in Australian
politics after the 1954-1955 Labor
Party splits were quite simply that it
took with it some of the Chifley Labor
Party’s most able leaders: Vince Gair
was the most prominent Labor person-
ality in Queensland, and, of course,
Premier at the time; Frank McManus
was Victorian secretary; and Jack
Kane, N.S.W. assistant secretary. Right
down the line the Labor Party was
stripped of some if its most competent
politicos, after Dr. Evatt suddenly
found it politically convenient to dis-
cover an “Outside influence” working
through the industrial groups in 1954.
Another factor was, of course, the
“outside influence” itself, Mr. B. A.
Santamaria, and his remarkable poli-
tical machine, known since 1958 as the
National Civic Council. Mr. Santa-
maria, the real initiator of the Labor
Party’s “industrial groups,” whose
principal objective was to wrest control
of trade unions from the Communist
Party, threw the resources of his
organisation behind the ALP (Anti-
Communist) as the DLP was first called.
The NCC, an organisation of Catholic
laymen, has about 6000 members of
whom an active 1000 are dedicated
enough to work at least one evening
a week and contribute a proportion of
their personal income by bank order
to the NCC. With a budget of about
$200,000 (about a half derived from a
publishing enterprise), the NCC sus-
tains a full-time staff of around 30.
National headquarters are in a large
suburban house in Riversdale Road,
Hawthorn, three miles out from the
centre of Melbourne, and there are
small offices in Sydney, Wagga, and
Townsville. Most of the staff specialise
in union affairs, but also are sporadi-
cally active in universities and in intel-
lectual circles through providing forums
for seminars and lectures.
Recently it has rhaintained a man
full-time in South-East Asia to estab-
lish and maintain contacts and report
back. Its magazine, “News Weekly,”
produced by the staff, has a circulation
of between 15,000 and 20,000, and
communication of information and ideas
is also provided through a considerable
flow of mimeographed material and
pamphlets.
At the time of the split which
spawned the DLP, Mr. Santamaria’s
movement had a considerable degree
of official Catholic Church recognition,
in Victoria, at least, and Mr. Santa-
maria was probably the closest friend
Archbishop Mannix had. Some of the
Catholic clergy were therefore actively
involved in helping Mr. Santamaria’s
movement. But that has gradually
ended, with the death of Dr. Mannix
and the disinvolvement of the Church
from politics.
The DLP-NCC relationship has for
a long time been treated by sympa-
thisers and opponents alike as something
rather disreputable. It is said that for
older Australians, brought up in a very
British Australia, Mr. Santamaria’s
very European name evokes powerful
prejudices, and opponents have
attempted to capitalise on this. (In
fact, of course, Mr. Santamaria is
Australian-born.) His movement did in
the early days operate with a consid-
erable degree of secretiveness, and Mr.
Santamaria admits that this was a bad
public-relations mistake. The dual
character of the NCC-DLP organisation
has a complexity in which suspicious
people can find something sinister.
But it is quite easy to see why the
two organisations are not merged.
There is first the fact that they are run
by separate people the NCC by
Mr. Santamaria, and the DLP by
Senator Gair. Both, like other people
in politics, are keen to retain the power
they have. They think alike on most
major issues and co-operate closely,
but their organisations retain separate
identities. The NCC has become less
exclusively Catholic in the past three
years, its working contacts with
non-Catholics have increased consid-
erably, and it is far less preoccupied
with narrowly Catholic doctrine, but it
remains a Catholic lay organisation.
The DLP, on the other hand, is non-
denominational. More than two-thirds
of its voters and perhaps three-quarters
of its activists are Catholics but this
means that it is no more Catholic than
the Liberal Party is Protestant.
About 80 percent of the NCC’s acti-
vists are supporters of the DLP, most of
the rest being members of either the
Liberal or the Country Party. A very
small number remain in the Labor
Party, though they are forced to keep
their NCC connections private, because
it is a proscribed organisation. In many
places NCC people are the driving
behind DLP activity, since cross
membership is considerable. *
In Victoria, for instance, the NCC
has about 300 active supporters, about
three-quarters of whom belong to the
DLP. Since the DLP in that State has
14,000 'members keen enough to pay
$lO a year subscription, it is apparent
that the NCC cannot simply dominate
the Party. There are a number of NCC
policies which the Party has repeatedly
rejected: a compulsory national savings
scheme for young unmarried employees
and various decentralisation proposals.
The Party is also rather more equivocal
in its advocacy of nuclear weapons than
the NCC. To put a label on it, the
DLP is rather to the “left”- of the
Council. On nationally contentious
issues with some potential for shaking
the solidity of the DLP there are simply
no differences of opinion. A DLP man
said si'mply: “About the only real
quarrels we have with Bob and his boys
are over dough. We find occasionally
he’s going to people we think are our
supporters, and he sometimes accuses
us of poaching in his territory.”
Mr. Santamaria is very much the
ideas man and dynamo. He and his
30-man full-time staff inevitably swing
a considerable amount of weight. The
DLP has eleven full-time workers in
comparison: five in Victoria, two each
in N.S.W. and Queensland, and one in
W.A. and S.A., and 25,000 'members
throughout Australia. It is comparable
in size with both the Liberal Party and
the ALP, its great difference being that
it doesn’t have the business and union
backing of these two major Parties. In
Victoria it is the largest of all political
Parties in terms of active membership,
having over 200 branches, but it is
surprisingly strong in N.S.W. and
Queensland, with 40 branches regularly
meeting in those two States.
For most DLP members the NCC’s
“News Weekly” is a major source of
news and views, and Mr. Santamaria’s
“Point Of View” television commentary,
broadcast in Melbourne, Canberra,
Sydney, Brisbane, Townsville, Rock-
hampton, Launceston, and Hobart, is a
major source of DLP inspiration. It
must be added that, since it is watched
by over half a million viewers each
week it is obviously an influence far
beyond the DLP. Increasing numbers
of Liberal voters evidently see it.
The DLP has a variety of less im-
pressive publications: “Democrat,” a
rather old-fashioned, badly laid-out bi-
monthly newspaper which, however,
claims an extraordinary circulation of
30,000 in Victoria alone; “Focus,” pub-
lished by Federal Secretary Jack Kane,
a small, modern monthly news-sheet
circulating about 5000 copies in N.S.W.,
Queensland, W.A., and S.A.; and
“Spectra,” an irregular theoretical
publication. There are suggestions that
“Democrat” and “Focus” may be
merged to produce a more impressive
monthly magazine, in which case Mr.
Santamaria’s “News Weekly” will have
a serious rival.
If it is true that Mr. Santamaria and
his considerable organisation often take
initiatives which the DLP follows, it
most certainly does not follow that
the DLP is a tail wagged by the NCC,
as often alleged by critics. It isn’t any-
where near as simple as that. The DLP
Senators Gair, McManus, Little, and
Byrne are independent-minded men
with plenty of self-confidence and
ability to initiate new lines of policy.
They operate with complete indepen-
dence, and no more than occasional and
casual co-operation with Mr. Santa-
maria in the Parliament. He has been
unsuccessful on several recent occasions
in which he has suggested policy lines
to them. Being more of a decentraliser
than the DLP, he has urged them, for
example, to consider taking up the com-
plaints of State Premiers about the
financial deal they are getting from
the Commonwealth. But they have re-
jected that. Initiatives are sometimes
taken by the DLP team, with Mr.
Santamaria coming in behind. The most
notable example of this was the adop-

If you think QANTAS fuels on Ampol
only because it's Australian...
how come Canadian Pacific and KLM do the same?
Qantas awarded Ampol a five year contract in 1965 for supplies
of jet fuel. Each Qantas 707 eats 600 gallons in take off alone
and uniform quality of that fuel is essential. International
airline agreements specify critical standards for aviation fuel.
Ampol won this contract with fuel supplied from its own
Brisbane refinery. Not only because Qantas wanted to support
another Australian industry. But for the same reason that
K.L.M. and Canadian Pacific refuel on Ampol it's the best!
It's good to know the best is Australian.
So why go past the Australian company?

The Savoy Plaza is one of Melbourne’s most popular hotels,
right at the centre of things. Across the road from the major
interstate rail terminal, a few minutes from the airway
terminals, just a step from the city’s commercial hub and a
leisurely stroll to Collins Street, famed for its shops, restaurants
and theatres.
It has a brand new Convention Centre and everything that
goes to make for well organised, smooth-running conventions,
big or small.
The Savoy offers top class accommodation and round-the-
clock room service seven days a week, with liquor at bottle
shop prices between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. Mondays to Saturdays.
On the spot there’s the exciting atmosphere and superb
entertainment of the Rainbow Room Restaurant and for
something a little more active the Bavarian heartiness of
the Keller.
With all this, no wonder the Savoy Plaza is popular.
A phone call to your nearest Federal Group hotel will bring

tion of a selective preference policy.
As early as July, Senator Gair and his
colleagues decided that Mr. Gorton’s
defence policy (or lack of it) was so
unacceptable to them that they might
select a number of seats in which they
would give preferences to the Right-
wing Labor men rather than to Gov-
ernment candidates. Mr. Santamaria
was not convinced of the wisdom of
this until early into October, and he
did not manage until later still to per-
suade all of his NCC colleagues of the
feasibility of the new Gair strategy.
Liberals, indeed, were putting the
word around that Mr. Santamaria
wasn’t backing Gair after he had, in
fact, come around. It was to discredit
this rumor of disunity that Mr. Santa-
maria so unequivocally put a DLP line
on the undesirability of an early elec-
tion in his “Point of View” commentary
just before Mr. Gorton finally decided
against it.
ANU political scientist, Alan Hughes,
says that, by all the measures he can
find, the DLP is Australia’s centre
party cn most domestic policy issues. It
is somewhere between the ALP and
the Government on most matters of
“socialist content,” its supporters being
somewhat more favorable to Govern-
ment business enterprise, to enlargement
of social services and redistributive taxes
than Government supporters, but
somewhat less “progressive” or “radical”
than ALP people, in this respect. On
matters of what Mr. Hughes describes
as “conscience radicalism” like
capital punishment, economic aid to
underdeveloped countries, white Austra-
lia policy, and Aboriginal rights he
finds they are decisively the most pro-
gressive and “Left-wing” of all the
political Parties. On foreign policy they
are not unexpectedly most anti-Com-
munist, and they rank it more highly
as a priority than supporters of other
political Parties for whom domestic
issues rate more highly.
Mr. Hughes’ survey work finds that
DLP supporters are the most politically
conscious—a higher proportion regu-
larly talking politics than Labor and
Liberal voters. They are also noticeably
younger, and more concentratedly
middle-class in social origin. Another
academic, Tony Staley, of Melbourne,
who did an attitude survey of young
activists of different political persua-
sions, found the characteristic of DLP
men was strong rejection of the British'
link combined with scepticism about the
United States, and a rather nationalist
desire for an independent Australia
role in South-East Asia.
It is, perhaps, the Irish-Australian
origins of many DLP people and their
traditional irreverence toward Britain
which has fitted them better for a
period in which Australia is more alone
and independent. Whatever the origins
of their thinking about Australia’s place
in the world, it is difficult to contest
the DLP claim that their pplicies have
stood the test of time, and that they
have therefore been able to maintain a
consistency and to exude a self-
confidence about their own judgment
which neither the Liberals nor Labor
have managed. Labor vilified the
Americans only to find, embarrassingly,
an increasing need to cite them' as
exemplars. It spoke of Communist
“national liberation” as a popular
reforming wave of the future only to
find, one by one, that its hero leaders of
Asia—Lee Kuan Yew, the Indians, and
most recently Sihanouk—denouncing it.
Its neutralism has always smacked too
much of capitulation.
The Liberals on the other hand have
displayed a colonial-type faith in great
and powerful friends, thinking that we
could indefinitely avoid the nastiness
of real involvement in regional prob-
lems by token gestures.. We sent one-
and-a-half battalions to Malaysia dur-
ing Confrontation, while the British
sent 30; we have three battalions in
Vietnam, while the Americans have
over a hundred. Largely as a result of
having to carry an excessive share of
the burden of these efforts at keeping
the peace, our great and powerful allies
have felt it is too much for them.
The British are getting out and the
Americans are declaring that they are
not great and powerful enough to
carry on virtually alone.
Token gestures have failed, and the
Liberal Party is deeply split between
the isolationists who want to retract
into a “Fortress Australia,” being neu-
tral and uninvolved as the Labor Party
has advocated for years, and on the
other hand those who admit the need
to meet the challenge, to develop
greater capacity. This wing of Liberal
opinion admits privately that the DLP
has been repeatedly right in its pre-
dictions. As the DLP said so vigor-
ously from the 1961 election campaign
onwards, the British were likely to go,
and the Americans, these Liberals now
admit, no longer look like gilt-edged
guarantors. Mr. Nixon sounds like a
DLP speech: Americans will contribute
to the security of only those who
will make a real effort at self-reliance,
and who will work with their neighbors
at generating mutual security.
The future of the DLP depends very
much on what happens within the
Liberal Party in its new, continuing
debate on foreign policy. If Mr. Gorton
wins, as he may in the immediate
future, then the Government could be
moving against the feeling of the elec-
torate the way the ALP did from the
’fifties on. National opinion surveys
report that a clear majority of Aus-
tralians have believed the country
should use its military forces to combat
Communism in Asia. Only a third of
the electorate had doubts on that score.
Sixty-two percent thought “Com-
munism in Asia is a great danger to
Australia.” Fifty-four percent believed
defence spending should increase, 46
percent thought that we should “set
about getting atomic weapons for
defence now.’'
Another possibility is that the Labor
Party, in an attempt to distinguish itself
from a leftward-moving Gorton Gov-
ernment, will move further left in
foreign policy toward Dr. Cairns.
Gortlamism may be a short-lived
phenomenon. DLP people suspect this
because they think that Mr. Whitlam
cannot last very much longer in the
Labor Party. As recently as August Mr.
Whitlam’s people were talking with the
DLP of plans to hive off their Left-wing
in a row over the Harradine affair, and
of re-forming a Party in which the
DLP would provide weighty support.
But, like a dozen other plans before,
it came to nothing because Mr. Whit-
lam couldn’t carry anyone with him.
“Reunification with the Labor Party
is now more remote a possibility than
it has ever been, since the split,” a DLP
man said to me last week, ft seems
indeed that the DLP is reaching a turn-
ing point in its history. It is in the
process of abandoning the idea of going
back into the Labor Party, and adopt-
ing the third-force concept. For years
it has been rejecting this. Proposals to
rename' the Party the Democratic
Party have been knocked back time and
again on the argument that the aban-
donment of the middle word “Labor”
would signify a final breaking of links
with the ALP. “Labor” has been re-
tained in the title despite the fact that
the DLP knows it costs them votes and
that it does not really accord with their
view of themselves. They reject the
principle of union affiliation and there-
fore have no valid claim to represent
“Labor” specially. But they have stuck
with it out of hope of reunification.
In one sense the DLP has already
set itself on course as a third force by
its adoption of the selective preference
policy. There are a number of reasons
why they did this and they must be
examined. The first may have been
quite simply that Senator Frank
McManus has been out of DLP policy-
making during a critical phase, being
'on an extended overseas trip. Though
he might, in the event, have gone along
with Senator Gair’s strategy of selective
preferences, it would have been a more
difficult switch for him since he has
usually been a stronger supporter of
traditional DLP policy of patiently
acting the roadblock and waiting on
ALP reform. He has been the strongest
opponent in the past of the DLP
striking out as a third force. Senator
Gair, on the other hand, has always
been quite sceptical about the possibility
of reunification and has for long felt
the need to break out as a third force,
when the opportunity arose.
A less speculative argument is the
DLP’s view that the roadblock stance
has become increasingly irrelevant and
futile. “We acted the roadblock to
Labor for a long time, but now we don’t
need to any more. Labor keeps itself
out these days,” was the way one DLP
leader put it. A very large Government
majority and continuing turmoil,

Jouiiial
dissension and bad morale within the
Labor Party have given the DLP plenty
of room for manoeuvre.
Linally, the decisive argument for
setting out as a third force has been a
historical analogy. DLP strategists
speculate that 1968 may be seen to be
a turning point for them, rather like
that of 1954. In that year Dr. Evatt
turned upon them and faced them with
the alternative of getting out or aban-
doning what they believed in most:
policies of strong defence and positive
involvement in world affairs.
People in the DLP could have
chosen to shut up and stay inside the
Evatt Party, manoeuvring within it to
reverse the trend. Most decided to get
out and discredit those policies by
public attacks from outside. They
believe they did the right thing.
They are now drawing an analogy
between Dr. Evatt and Mr. Gorton.
They argue, that for reasons of his
own, he wants to lead his Party in a
neutralist direction. He gives defence a
low priority. Moreover, they predict
that by this shift he will, lead his own
Party into a period of intense internal
turmoil, dissension, and factionalism out
of which will come unprecedentedly
ineffectual leadership, like that which
afflicted the Labor Party after the
split.
They feel that they can no more
support this than
they could sup-
port the Labor
Party in the mid-
’s Os. An impor-
tant article in Mr.
Kane’s journal,
“Locus,” hinted at
this thinking. It said that the DLP had
for a long time criticised the Govern-
ment for being tardy and inadequate in
its action on defence: L 'But at least the
DLP has always been able to convince
its supporters that they should give
their second preferences to the Liberal
and Country Parties because the
direction of their foreign policy has
been right, while that of the ALP
has clearly been wrong. Mr. Gorton
himself is increasingly throwing doubt
on this long-standing proposition.
Whenever he has spoken of defence
since he became Prime Minister, he
has spoken of it simply in terms of
defending the Australian mainland.
“This Portress Australia mentality
appears to have more affinity to
the extreme Leftist-thinking of Mr.
Calwell and Dr. Cairns than to any-
thing his predecessors or colleagues
have been saying. Mr. Gorton’s thinking
may, if carried into effect, come to
jeopardise the Australian-American
alliance. That alliance is based
increasingly on Australia pulling its
weight in the South-East Asian region.”
It concluded with this proposition:
“Were Mr. Gorton to lead the Govern-
ment toward Evatt - Calwell - Cairns
policies of isolationism and national
weakness, there would be little that the
DLP could do to save the Government.
Even if it should still want to save it.”
The greatest hurdle the DLP has to
jump is, of course, to break into the
House of Representatives. In many seats
in past elections it has got within a
small margin of getting the second
highest number of primary votes, and
on present form it must soon fluke a
man in the House, the way Captain Sam
Benson and other independents have
got in from time to time. Its vote is
growing, as seen by Senator Little’s
amazing vote in Victoria last year,
where he was the first DLP man to be
elected solely on primary votes. The
fluking of a seat or two in the House
of Representatives combined with con-
tinued dissension within the two big
Parties and a messy sort of Labor-
Liberal consensus on a neutralist foreign
policy could have an avalanche effect
for the DLP.
If it is to work toward this, it prob-
ably has to make a number of changes.
It has to demonstrate convincingly that
its foreign policy can be sustained and
paid for. It probably has to rid itself
of the old Labor tag by becoming rhe
Democratic Party. Its domestic policy
progra’ms are midway between the con-
servatism of the Liberals and the
radicalism of Labor and simply need
to be sharpened up to have electoral
appeal. Above all, for any move into
the House of Representatives the DLP
needs powerful new personalities: Mr.
Santamaria, a liability in his present
ambiguous posi-
tion, might be con-
verted into a great
asset as leader of a
Lower House
team. And, finally,
the DLP, very
experienced in ex-
ploiting the fears of the electorate,
needs to begin to work harder on
appealing to its hopes.
Australians thinking in terms of
British and American politics tend to
dismiss the possibility of smaller Parties
surviving long. And with a Government-
Opposition. pendulum theory in the back
of their minds they tend to view
smaller Parties as a temporary untidi-
ness, which will quite soon be swept
from the scene. This, incidentally, is
probably why academics and journalists
alike have so greatly neglected the DLP
in the past.
But it is arguable that we are moving
into a period in which we have a multi-
Party system, closer to European models
than to the Anglo-American two-Party
system. In a multi-Party set-up political
habits would have to change, as they
indeed are already tending to change.
Political leaders would see their task
as being to deal with the smaller
Parties as well as with their own
internal dissidents. Party politics would
take on a more fluid character, with
shifting coalitions and temporary
alliances. Electors will inevitably come
then to recognise the potential of the
smaller Parties and see the political
struggle as being no longer a choice
simply between Liberal and Labor. In
these circumstances the DLP and the
Country Party could expand in parlia-
mentary representation..


THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Another kind of festival
where the arts chase
the cows home early
By GEORGE FARWELL
THIS FESTIVAL thing is spreading. If
we’re not careful, Australians soon will
become known as a race of anti-
sportsmen, neglecting racecourses,
cricket, and footie grounds for esoteric
spectator sports like opera, ballet, and
symphony music. The virus has now
spread to tropical Queensland, more
often associated with the brawnier arts
of growing and cutting cane.
The small sugar city of Innisfail
began its second annual festival on
December 7 with a 15-day program
that makes no concessions to “popular”
taste. Unlike Adelaide or Perth, it has
not waited on government subsidies,
solicited no charity handouts from big
industry, nor even tried to sweeten its
cultural appeal with social carryings-on.
White ties and tails obviously are out
in the tropics during December, but
Mozart, Brahms and Puccini are not.
The organisers have gone quietly about
producing a program of musical,
operatic, and ballet performances, as
well as master and student teaching
classes on the kind of budget that
would not pay for a single episode of
“Bellbird” or “Homicide.”
Former Covent Garden prima
ballerina Elaine Fifield has assembled
a company for two performances of
“Les Sylphides” and “Coppelia,” Act
II; opera director James Christiansen
has flown out from London, at his own
expense, to produce a two-act version
of “La Boheme”; while Brisbane
musicians David MacFarlane and John
Curro have travelled a thousand miles
north to look after the musical side,
which includes three concerts by the
60-player Festival Symphony Orchestra.
My curiosity in this activity was first
aroused when I saw a small country
Press item stating that a private con-
servatorium had been formed in
Innisfail. As soon as I arrived there
I sought out the young man said to be
behind it 35-year-old Rod Taylor,
a trained singer who won Queensland’s
bass championship some years ago, then
became the Queensland Light Opera
Company’s leading baritone in “White
Horse Inn” and “New Moon.”
Taylor says plans are well advanced
for making the conservatorium a perma-
nent home for music, with or without
any possible subsidies. The large, two-
storey building is also the home of Mr.

Among . the enthusiasts he has
attracted is his close friend Ronald
Maconaghie, the opera singer, who has
persuaded a number of other artists to
g° North, and who ran Innisfail’s opera
tuition last year. The total outlay that
time, including teachers’ fees, came to a
mere $1556, and the festival showed a
deficit of $209. This year financial help
has come from the Innisfail Shire
Council and the Chamber of Com-
merce, though the whole enterprise
could not have been mounted without
the support of Mr. Lewis Reid, for the
Innisfail’s conservatorium of music—“a gift from the angels”
Elaine Fifield. . .with loyalties recon-
ciled, a return to the stage
permanent use of his home is a gift
from the angels.
Innisfail always has been music-
minded. Two rather more modest
summer schools of music were staged
there in 1961-62; the ABC’s Queens-
land orchestra gets good audiences on
its annual tour of the North; while the
Elizabethan Trust’s opera company and
JCW companies have made a number
of visits. But Mr. Taylor wants to see
more than passive audiences applauding
from the stalls. He wants to stimulate
people into taking a more creative role
themselves. This was a major emphasis
in the first Innisfail festival last year,
during which the Brisbane violinist
John Curro, who has a long association
with the Queensland Conservatorium,
brought together an orchestra of 35
local people.
It has not been easy bringing them
all together, even though a Far North
Sinfonietta has now been formed on a
permanent basis. Some of the per-
formers have to travel quite a long
distance, notably farmers and their
wives living 60 miles away on the
Atherton Tableland. They had to get
their cows into the habit of being
milked early in order to race down the
mountain to rehearsals and concerts in
Innisfail. The most promising develop-
ment for the future is the number of
locals enrolling for the summer school.
Master and student classes in voice
training, for instance, are being taken
by James Christiansen, a Queenslander
who now teaches at Trinity College,
London, and has sung leading roles at


Glyndebourne and the Dublin Opera,
and who is now on a brief holiday in
Queensland. David MacFarlane, music
principal at Brisbane’s Church of
England Grammar School, is- coaching
children, and the ABC pianist John
Champ is teaching accompaniment and
the guitar.
Last year’s summer school gave 232
hours of classes to 71 students, and had
a waiting list for voice production and
piano. The three teachers involved were
just not enough, and this year’ have
been increased to five.
Mr. Taylor’s other achievement this
year has been in recruiting Elaine
Fifield, who has at last reconciled her
division of loyalties between raising a
family and appearing on stage. It is
nine years since she left Covent Garden
at the peak of her career to live in New
Guinea with her planter husband, tell-
ing the Press that “Mrs. Farley would
never dance again.” Then, in 1964, she
returned to the stage, dancing for two
seasons with the Australian Ballet before
making another home with her husband
in Cairns, where she now runs a ballet
school. The response has been so great
that she has now opened three more
small schools, one of them in Innisfail.
For her stage performances this month
she has engaged Ken McCaffrey and
other leading dancers from the newly
formed Queensland Ballet Company.
There are great difficulties in trying
to develop the arts so far from any
large centre. Innisfail has only 7000
people. To a large extent the festival
cannot help but have a largely amateur
basis, even if it is later able to secure
sbme form of government subsidy. But
the question of amateurism is beside
the point. Unlike other festivals, this
one is not trying to put on a big show
for a couple of weeks, to stun everyone
with celebrities and drain away creative
energies for the rest of the year. The
idea is to stimulate local interest in the
arts and keep it going, especially
through the conservatorium and the
Sinfonietta; in fact, to draw the
talented into performing and giving the
region its own creative life.
But, I don’t think Mr. Taylor has
any such 'messianic vision. He just
happens to love music and wants to
have more of it around. In striving for
this, he has charmed farmers away from
their cows, found an orchestra leader
in an Ampol dealer of Italian descent,
communicated with a newly arrived
Italian storekeeper and clarinettist who
barely speaks English, and persuaded a
notable graduate of the Queensland
Conservatorium, now a mother of six,
to reopen her violin case, after swearing
she would never play again.
Who knows what future talent may
be found in a sugar belt so largely
peopled by the compatriots of Verdi
and Puccini? Curiously, the keenest
patrons of the arts there, apart from
Anglo-Saxons, are the Spanish and
Chinese communities. It rather looks as
if this kind of multi-racial texture,
sometimes deplored by southern poli-
ticians, may be a creative force.

The parent is right to think some-
.. . F , 5 i•i ij , oc ,
thing is wrong when his child s clas
files on to the stage and sings Trees
m unison. A large part of the trouble
stems from the lack of music and drama
specialists working in the primary
departments. Syllabus obligations can be
fulfilled by catching the appropriate
broadcast, but when it comes to the
production of anything within the
school, the music is passed over to the
teacher who can play the piano, and
the drama to the teacher who is inter-
ested. Playing the piano is not neces-
sarily synonymous with musical taste
or ability and interest in drama is no
guarantee of theatrical imagination, and
this accounts for the tedium at these
functions which is so prevalent as to be
general.
Unfortunately, a pattern tends to
become fixed in some schools, and even
the influx of new staff has little effect,
for, too often, the ossification process is
complete. The solution of the problem
is obvious: music and drama specialists
for the primary departments, and these
specialists to have imagination, enthusi-

FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
DOING WITHOUT DICKENS
Oliver! Director, Carol Reed.
THERE WAS a time when musicals
for stage or screen had books written
specially for them. Pretty silly most of
them were, too, but at least they fitted
comfortably into the conventions of
the musical show. Nowadays they’re
generally based on an already success-
ful novel or play, whose too frequent
unsuitability prompted an exasperated
American critic to suggest that a
musical could be made of “Oedipus
Rex,” pointing out that there was a
ready-made theme song in “I want a
girl just like the girl who married dear
old Dad.”
Of course, there have been cases,
such as “My Fair Lady,” in which the
adaptation succeeded brilliantly, and
nobody could be other than beguiled by
“South Pacific” or “Carousel.”
Dickens seems to me the very worst
candidate for song-and-dance treat-
ment, for, despite his Victorian senti-
mentality and the thundering coinci-
dences by which he resolved his plots,
he was fundamentally a realist and a
social moralist. None of this, of
course, comes across in “Oliver!”—nor,
I suppose, does it have any place in it.
The scriptwriter (whose name appears
in, letters about quadruple the size of
the author’s) is airily credited with
having “freely adapted” it. He has kept
the sentimentality and the coinciden-
talism, and got rid of Dickens.
Perhaps it doesn’t matter that much.
From all I can gather, nobody ever
reads Dickens any more except for
me, and I suppose it’s foolish to com-
plain that the workhouse boys, though
Mark Lester as Oliver dancing with his
friends in Fagin’s den
clad in becoming tatters, are as rosy-
cheeked and energetic a lot of healthy
children as you’d want to see as they
sing full-throatedly of such glorious
food as “hot sausage and mustard
jelly and custard”; comestibles whose
very existence was unknown to them.
Apart from the theme, the plot takes a
beating, since Carol Reed’s concern is
mainly to make the most of the musical
numbers. Most of them are handsomely
staged but surely overlong.
Ron Moody makes Fagin a rather
more engaging scamp than, the black
villain I remember, but it’s an enter-
taining and highly professional per-
formance. Oliver Reed often conveys
the barely leashed, brutish violence of
Sikes; this performance and the very
short appearance of Peggy Mount as
Mrs. Bumble have some of the authentic
flavor. Mark Lester is a suitably pretty
little martyr as Oliver.
So, if you can get Dickens out of
your mind (an almost automatic
process with most people), “Oliver!”
is lively enough entertainment, very
handsomely photographed in color.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
GASP OF SPRING
Breath of Spring. Peter Coke. Inde-
pendent Theatre, Sydney.
THE LAST TIME I saw this plot-
line, some eight years ago, it was
supporting Athene Seyler and Terry-
Thomas in a modestly amusing little
film called “Make Mine Mink.” I
assume it was derived from “Breath of
Spring,” which, now more of a gasp,
cannot be much less than ten years
old. It’s the one about the genteel gang
of elderly eccentrics who steal furs for
thrills and give the proceeds to charity.
This hobby brightens up their lives
somewhat and the play is at great pains
to point out that there’s a lot of life
in the over-fifties and that you’re as
young as you feel. Unfortunately, the
selfconscious repetition of this harm-
less message produces the impression
that the play was expressly designed to
accommodate an elderly cast and
reassure a moribund audience.
Despite the fact that she finds
“being” Lady Beatrice “loads of jolly
good fun,” Anna Russell did not
impress me as being entirely at ease
perhaps because the part, singularly
devoid of comic invention, does not
permit her to communicate much of
the fun. What there is of it comes
mainly from the supporting carica-
tures: Bunney Brooke is the “butch”
voice teacher (the Hattie Jaques part);
Betty Lucas is the incompetent por-
celain-mender (an Esme Cannon
derivation); Redmond Phillips is the
retired brigadier (rather less animated
than Terry-Thomas). Alan Davis, “the
original London director,” who “has
flown out specially to direct the play,”
provides those amusing groupings,
carefully disposed bits of business with
fern-baskets and fast curtains, which
are such an essential part of this sort
of undertaking.
The play was described deprecat-
ingly by Miss Russell in a curtain
speech as “our little farce,” but even
on its own terms it seems a very dull
piece of nonsense.
THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
PUSHING DOWN WALLS
A Day in the Death of Joe Egg. Peter
Nichols. Melbourne Theatre Com-
pany.
FOR SOME years screen-writers, par-
ticularly in Britain, have been discard-
ing trad plots in favor of mod
momentum. The artificial structuring
of the conventional scenario has been
replaced with an exhilarating informal-
ity, expressed in either the discontinuous
images of “A Hard Day’s Night” or the
free-wheeling narrative style of a “Billy
Liar,” “Morgan,” or “Georgy Girl.”
This idiom of carefully simulated
spontaneity popped up recently in
Calder Willingham’s script for “The
Graduate,” and is now fairly common
in both dramatised documentaries for
television and fringe theatre produc-
tions for cult audiences. Now “Joe
Egg,” a play by the author of “Georgy
Girl,” brings the discontinuous style to
the conventional theatre, an.d it is more
than welcome.
Peter Nichols is himself the father of
a spastic child, and his play is almost
as cathartic to watch as it must have
been to write. It is completely informal
in structure, and in the excellent first
act dispenses with all the usual and
usually inhibiting dramatic conven-
tions. The so-called fourth wall is
rejected in favor of direct addresses to
the audience, and when the parents
re-enact key scenes from their ten-
year tragedy they are not in the usual
form of flash-backs. Instead, the scenes
are played for laughs, in conscious
and effective parody. From these re-
enactments we learn of the elaborate
defences built up by each parent. In
fact, we not only learn of these defences
but are told of them directly by the
characters themselves.
However, for all its deft delineation
of the parents’ character, the first act
of “Joe Egg” is basically a dramatised
documentary on the facts of life with
a helpless, hopeless spastic, and where
theatre usually universalises this play
particularises, and communicates a
great amount of straight data.
So far so good. But things start to
go wrong in the second half when
Nichols introduces three other actors.
Two of them play middle-class stereo-
types, and the third plays Bri’s suffo-
catingly possessive mother. If only
Nichols had chosen to let Bri and
Sheila portray this trio just as they had
the rest of the characters. But with their
entry there is an inexplicable and
damaging regression to a conventional
dramatic format. The second act raises
some important issues, including the

artes studios
inevitable question of euthanasia, but it
does so with such heavy-handed melo-
drama that it seems a second author
has taken over. While Nichols sustains
his verbal flair, stylistic momentum is
lost and the artificialities of the plot
intrude.
However, even with this nosedive,
the play is still vital, and George
Ogilvie’s production is a good one,
although I would question the casting
on a number of counts. Lyndell Rowe
is an intelligent and honest actress,
but she seemed far too young for the
wife, just as Virginia Vagg seemed far
too old for the child. And, while the
role of Bri’s mother was badly written,
Leila Blake gave a surprisingly sloppy,
poorly judged performance. Robin
Ramsay, who played Bri, seems to have
been heavily influenced by his associa-
tion with Barry Humphries, but that’s
not to denigrate his performance, as it
would be hard to imagine anyone play-
ing the part an atom better.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
WIDE-EYED TO BATTLE
NEVILLE CARDUS once said he was
convinced that every second person in
Australia played the piano, and, what
is more, played it well. Allowing for
the element of romantic overstate-
ment in this dictum, it is, nevertheless,
an observation which is germane and
salutary to the contemporary musical
scene. I must admit that my heart
is saddened at the spectacle of so many
talented young people charging wide-
eyed into the rat race of international
pianism. The present Professor of
Psychology at the University of Sydney
was a pianistic prodigy, and the Pro-
fessor of Mathematics at the University
of New South Wales can play the leg
off an iron pot, and, although one can’t
expect the current crop of young
pianists to achieve such spectacular
success in such diverse fields, one
hopes that they will keep a few eggs
aside from the main basket of their
dreams.
In the space of two months or so,
we have had recitals from three able
Sydney pianists who plan to go over-
seas for further study, undoubtedly
with the intention of breaking into the
concert field. All three, Charles Glenn,
Daniel Herscovitch, and Diane Selmon,
have excellent potential and lack
nothing that age should not cause to
blossom or the years to adorn.
As usual they all assayed major
works with qualified success and
revealed distinct flairs in lesser compo-
sitions. Charles Glenn’s Debussy was
evocative and sensitive as was Daniel
Herscovitch’s Chopin group, the
latter’s recital also containing a
remarkably accurate reading of the
Liszt Sonata.
Diane Selmon’s recent concert at the
Conservatorium was probably the most
rewarding of the three, yet here again
the most obviously successful playing,
discounting the charming Bartok Folk
Song arrangements, was in the three
movements from the “Iberia Suite” of
Albeniz, which opened the program.
In these evocative pieces Miss Selmon
displayed a beautiful legato and splen-
didly balanced dynamics; only when
fully technically extended did the
spirit tend to be lost, for the pianist
at these times was exclusively occupied
with the business of getting all the
notes in. That she managed to get
through these diabolical passages with-
out making obvious tempo concessions
was indicative of a formidable tech-
nique even at this early stage of her
career. However, this is not unusual,
these days, when youngsters play works
at their diploma examinations which
were the province of a handful of
virtuosos in the not-so-distant past.
The most significant pointer to the
future in this recital was the F Minor
Sonata of Brahms, for here Miss
Selmon seemed completely at home,
realising the epic if somewhat youth-
fully prodigal nature of the work and
at the same time holding it together
throughout its inordinate length with
only one minor lapse of concentration.
I could not help thinking that these
youngsters will be doing very well if
they play the piano with the vitality
and panache of Muriel Cohen, who was
the soloist with the ABC Symphony
Orchestra in the “Burlesque” of
Strauss in a Sunday Night Free Concert
at the Sydney Town Hall.

HELPING THE BOYS
NOW IS the time for Bob Hope to
take his bandwagon on an annual
pilgrimage to the world’s front lines
. . . “Dear Mom — well, Christmas
and old Ski Nose are with us again
over here . . . and wow! those girls
he brought along.” Which is to repre-
sent the sometimes almost non-existent
lines between entertainment and lust
when the show goes on in a sort of
sexual limbo.
The problem isn’t without its
students. One of them is the Rubens-
built actress, Raquel Welch, who was
quoted by the “Far East Economic
Review” after a recent trip to Vietnam.
“Sending girls like me to Vietnam to
entertain, the troops is like teasing a
caged lion with a piece of raw meat,”
she said. “I’m not criticising our boys’
thoughts or feelings one bit, I’m just
telling you what I know was going
through their minds ... As long as the
U.S. Government is going to send kids
like that off to an unpopular war, the
least it could do is take care of their
sexual needs. If the Government can.
organise college kids into a Peace
Corps to serve the needs of the poor
and uneducated, then it can also
organise prostitutes into Piece Corps to
serve the needs of the poor, sex-
starved GIs in Vietnam.”
JILTED BY CANBERRA
A TART comment on relations between
Australia and New Zealand is provided
by the recent experience of N.Z.’s
highly rated TV “Compass” team in
seeking interviews with Australian
Cabinet Ministers. “Compass” has the
greatest impact of any current-affairs
TV program in New Zealand, and one
of its teams has just returned home
after a month filming in Australia.
They wrote in advance, seeking inter-
views with Prime Minister Gorton on
Australian foreign policy and trade. Mr.
Gorton’s Press secretary, Tony Eggleton,
told the team that Mr. McEwen was
better qualified to talk on trade and that
the Prime Minister didn’t feel able to
give an interview on foreign policy to
the N.Z. team when he had ten similar
requests from Australian programs. The
team’s four days in Canberra were spent
waiting for these verdicts. By the time
they had the brush-off from Mr. Mc-
Ewen it was too late to arrange
substitutes.
The jilting “Compass” received in
Canberra contrasted with the help given
to “Four Corners” when it made a
program on New Zealand.
THE SPEECH NIGHT SHOW
UNABLE to accommodate all its boys
and their parents in the main hall for its
annual speech night, Sydney‘s Knox
Grammar School solved the problem by
the action through closed circuit
television to lawns outside and the
library underneath. Parents who had
to settle for the vicarious experience re-
ported that their greatest problem was
deciding whether or not to stand up for
the hymns. The conditioning influence
of leisurely TV in the home had them
nonplussed.
WHERE THE ACTION IS
A SURVEY last week found that
Melbourne was the “undisputed art
capital” of Australia in that of more
than 12,000 works of art in Australian
public galleries, 38 in every 100 were
painted by Victorians. While such
reasoning is extremely dubious, it is
worth considering all the artistic
endeavor that has surged forth in
Melbourne in 1968.
The city now has Australia’s best art
gallery, tbe most proficient and adven-
turous professional drama company—
and the only four-year film course in
the country. The film course is housed
in the Swinburn College of Technology
under the direction of Brian Robinson,
and might well form the basis of a
National Film School, which is expected
eventually to emerge under the sponsor-
ship of the Council for the Arts.
Also, Melbourne this year has pro-
duced Australia’s only truly indigenous
feature film—the Eltham-Senior pro-
duction, “2000 Weeks,” which is to be
distributed commercially by Columbia.
In the lighter or livelier arts, “Homi-
cide” and “Bellbird” are both produced
in Melbourne, as is most of the best
Australian pop music. Sydney, by rela-
tive comparison, is stagnant.
JOBS FOR THEIR OWN
PERTH seems to be showing the ad-
vantages of its annual arts festival.
Instead of observing a sort of cultural
close - down between festivals — as
Adelaide appears to do — Perth is
beginning to expand its artistic life.
For instance, visitors to the 1969 Festival
(from February 1) will find not one
Hole-in-the-Wall theatre, but three;
commercial art galleries are beginning
to sprout; the University of Western
Australia now has a complex of theatres
second to none in Australia.
The way in which the small Hole-in-
the-Wall Theatre has expanded is,
perhaps, most significant. This year the
company has built up a payroll of 51
actors, technicians, and front and back
of house people to serve the original
theatre and two branches (Music Holes)
which are catering most successfully for
theatre-restaurant audiences. The point
is not so much that Perth has begun
tapping what is now a fairly common
public taste in the eastern States, but
that it is overcoming the disadvantages
of its isolation by exploiting all its
opportunities to employ its own
theatrical practitioners. j

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
How to keep Australian companies Australian
AFTER THE near-hash-up of the
MLC affair, Prime Minister Gorton’s
latest move on economic nationalism,
this time in partnership with the
restraining force of Federal Treasurer
McMahon, has been an exemplar of
how government, when it can contain
itself no longer, should handle the
business world diplomatically.
Coincidence or not, the presence of
the president of the Associated Stock
Exchanges, Mr.xC. T. Looker, in Can-
berra last week was a good opportunity
for discussions on how Mr. Gorton and
Mr. McMahon felt about the latest
string of takeover bids for Australian
companies by overseas interests, and
takeover procedure in general. The
outcome was a suggestion that Mr.
Looker might care to discuss with
members of the Associated Stock
Exchanges amendments to their listing
requirements which, for the moment,
strongly disapprove of anything other
than equal voting rights for all shares
of the one class, for the purpose of
ensuring that the control of Australian
companies, exercised through the voting
powers of the shareholders, remains in
Australian hands.
Restrictions on the share-voting rights
of overseas shareholders are no new
deal here. Precedent was first estab-
lished on the suggestion of the Govern-
ment in 1914 when Amalgamated Wire-
less Australia came under attack by
Telefunken. As late as 1960, Australian
Paper Manufacturers restricted the
voting rights of overseas shareholders
for no more specific a reason than to
shield its vulnerability to possible take-
over by one of a number of overseas
paper companies.
Under its new articles, APM provided
that no share held by a person who is
not an Australian has voting power at
a poll at general meeting, and not less
than two-thirds of the director's of the
companies shall be Australians: “For
the purpose of these articles an Aus-
tralian means an Australian citizen as
defined in the Nationality and Citizen-
ship Act of the Commonwealth of Aus-
tralia at the date of the adoption of this
article or (where the context permits) a
corporation or company incorporated in
Australia which corporation or com-
pany is controlled both directly and
indirectly by Australian citizens within
the meaning of the said Act.”
Further clauses tighten the provision
of a set of articles which, for eight
years, have incurred the displeasure of
the Stock Exchanges, the broking frat-
ernity, and the majority of commenta-
tors on the business scene. APM insist
that they did not infringe any Stock
Exchange ruling, so ’ presumably its
home Exchange, Melbourne, gave
approval. Sydney insists it never gave
its approval, but APM remained listed.
Arguments against such restrictive
moves as APM has made, and which
the Government is suggesting every
company should be at least completely
free to make, start most basically at
the Exchanges and the broking houses,
where any move to restrict or even
dissuade the inflow of portfolio invest-
ment from abroad is by definition a
bad thing, because it is bad business.
lf the Stock Exchanges meet the
Government’s immediate wishes, it is
probable that a slight brake on portfolio -
inflow will be felt, but only on that
which is intended as the first move in
an eventual takeover, and that is pre-
cisely the sort of portfolio investment
which the Government would like to
stop. Conceivably, but unlikely, a few
of the more righteous overseas investors
would object on principle to having
Treasurer and
Prime Minister. . .
“diplomatic”
nationalism?
their voting rights removed, so,
theoretically, being deprived of a say
in the running of the company. But,
as far as London is concerned, non-
voting shares are a common enough
concept. And just how many of the
overseas shareholders, who sent more
than $4OO million here last year, ever
exercised the votes they had, anyway?
The majority were interested in capital
stability and appreciation, not company
control.
Local shareholders, most particularly
those that speculate heavily, will also
have cause for complaint that they will
be deprived of the possibility of some
fat capital gains.
It can also be argued that what the
Government is suggesting is yet another
layer of cottonwool for the incompet-
ents of the Australian industrial scene.
That has some validity. But it must also
be remembered that the overseas
activity we have seen in the takeover
field here over the past few weeks may
well only be the first trickle of a flood
which is to come. Members of even the
competent, strong, and successful board-
rooms could well then have to start
holding on to their seats. The outcomes
of recent onslaughts on the markets
have more than adequately demon-
strated that the local talent is not yet
a match for the professional tricks and
tough determination of the overseas
operators. Why else did the companies
that have now gone to the wall not fol-
low the course of APM in changing
their articles to save themselves? Did
they leave it too late? Did they become
confused in the rush? Or did they
simply not care?
Concrete Industries (Monier) Ltd.,
pursued by Redland Ltd. U.K., have
decided to wait no longer and are pre-
paring to call an extraordinary general
meeting on January 3 to alter the
articles of association, to limit the vot-
ing rights of overseas stockholders, and
escape the clutches of Redland. Con-
Crete Industries intend to limit the total
number of votes which can be exercised
by non-Australians and non-Australian
companies at any general meeting of the
company to 20 percent of the votes
capable of being cast by all the stock-
holders.
On the surface, the Government’s
latest exercise on overseas portfolio in-
vestment seems to have been a complete
non-issue. But could it really add up
to such a tiny ripple in a teacup? Mr.
Gorton, in his joint statement with Mr.
McMahon, made passing reference to
the purchase of shares by nominees,
first come-first served offers “and other
such measures designed to avoid the
v need for discussion with the company


concerned.” The general abuses of take-
over practice as laid down in company
law, by local- or overseas parties, seem
to have been the subject for discussion
with Mr. Looker. As in the recent case
of the Pergamon-News of the World
assault on the spirit of the takeover
code in London, Governments threaten
first and, if the business world does not
set its own house in order, move later.
The Stock Exchanges will undoubtedly
lift their disapproval of voting restric-
tions. But far more interesting would
be any other moves that they may make
in the weeks ahead.
MEN AND MATTERS
THE DRINKS WERE SOFT and
cool, the competition to sell them hot,
at times, even rough. Mr. R. John
Moore, the 44-year-old New Zealander
marketing manager of Coca-Cola
Bottlers (Melbourne) Pty. Ltd., which
has the franchise for Melbourne and
environs for the Coke range of drinks
and which was acquired along with a
couple of other softies by British
Tobacco a few years back, was filling
in the background to the half a million
dollars it is costing to launch the group’s
new lemonade into Australian throats.
From where Moore sits (in a spanking
new all-panelled suite in the depths of
Melbourne’s newest industrial jungle at
Moorabbin), the central object of the
marketing manager’s exercise, in what
he considers is one of the faster
growing markets for anything in Aus-
tralia, is to increase his company’s
share, not simply to hold on to the
considerable slice it’s already got.
Dunedin-born Moore has been a
Coca-Cola man n.early all his working
life. He got into the soft-drinks busi-
Bob Blackburn
John Moore
ness twenty years ago through answer-
ing a two-line advertisement in a Wel-
lington paper for a job with the local
branch of the Coca-Cola Export Cor-
poration (U.S.), which then had an
embryonic operation (boxes for office
seats and that sort of thing) in that
part of the world. After five years
helping Coke to grow up in Welling-
ton, Moore was moved north to Auck-
land to be sales manager of the
province’s Coca-Cola bottling com-
pany, and in the next few years estab-
lished five new bottling plants in the
area before coming to Melbourne in
1959 as sales manager of the Mel-
bourne outfit. In 1962 he was sent to
the States on an overseas manager’s
course at Atlanta and a general run-
round of the Coca-Cola set-up in
America. Mr. Moore was treated to a
similar trot on getting the marketing
manager’s post three years ago, but
this time he was put through an. inten-
sive Harvard Advanced Management
Course.
These deep but brief excursions into
higher formal education have come
rather later and in strong contrast to '
his early educational experience. The
New Zealand Air Force claimed him at
the tender age of seventeen, when still
studying for matriculation, and he
spent nearly four years with it on
overseas training (Canada) and opera-
tions (Europe). When Moore returned
to N.Z. from that lot, the jobs to
hand were not all that compatible with
his inclinations. After a spell with a
wool firm came the opportunity to get
with Coca-Cola.
TWO KIWIS who have made the
feathers fly since they moved into the
Australian financial scene some four
years ago are Messrs R. A. (Ron)
Brierley and R. J. (Bob) Blackburn.
Their activities last week centred on
New Redhead Estate and Coal Co.
Ltd., on which they served a first-
come-first-served bid in September. At
a tense annual meeting, the chairman
and two members of New Redhead’s
board were preparing to resist the
boarding party of “the Brierley group,”
who sought representation on the
board, when they unexpectedly
received a takeover offer from
Hookers.
Messrs. Brierley and Blackburn were
the first in Australia to use the first-
come-first-served technique of gaining
influence in or control of a company,
when they took over the Citizens and
Graziers Life Assurance Co. Ltd.,
which, being a private company, did
not attract much attention at the time.
This company had not paid a prefer-
ence or ordinary dividend in the 40
years of its existence so, according to
Blackburn, the preference shareholders
were “utterly enchanted” to receive $7
for their shares, including 40 years’
arrears of dividend.
Since the Citizens and Graziers deal
at the end of 1964, the Kiwis have had
a host of company skirmishes —Hawkes-
bury Development, Harbour Lighterage,
Stack and Co., South Coast Estates,
Chapmans, Swans, Minerva Centre,
Indooroopilly Toll Bridge. Some have
been successfully taken over, some not;
but all, according to Blackburn, have
brought benefits to shareholders.
The vehicle for these bids has been
the Melbourne listed investment com-
pany, Industrial Equity Ltd., which the
Brierley group bought out via the
Citizens and Graziers, in June 1966. Its
shares are currently quoted 55 percent
above par. Some of its battles go to
the law courts, which Blackburn regrets
for the cost and the delay involved.
Blackburn (now 46) and Brierley
(31) first came together in New Zealand
when Blackburn was a joint managing
director of the first public superannua-
tion fund for self-employed persons.
Brierley was one of its representatives.
They are both “uncompleted account-
ants,” for they were too busy practising
to qualify. y
TARIFF CONTROVERSY
"BLACK JACK" SIZZLES
GOVERNMENT TARIFF policy is
going to be an even more controversial
topic than ever following Trade
Minister McEwen’s sizzling attack on
the Tariff Board. Only last week four
senior members of his Party banded
together to sign a strong letter defend-
ing the Tariff Board and indirectly
challenging Mr. McEwen. The letter,
directed to the “Financial Review,”
said, inter alia:
“It is natural to expect manufac-
turing interests enjoying protection in
excess of 50 percent to mount a
vigorous campaign against any pro-
posals to examine critically and rigor-
ously their privileged position. In many
cases, this position was acquired in the
absence of a Tariff Board inquiry. In
other instances it was the result of lax
investigations conducted in the guide-
line-free environment of years past.
The Tariff Board is in a position to be
more acutely conscious of the deficien-
cies of past tariff-making practices than
almost anyone else in this country.
Their courage in acting on their
realisation is no mean feat and deserves
a far broader measure of support than
it has enjoyed hitherto . . .
“In a rational world, we feel the
overwhelming advantages of what the
Tariff Board proposes to do would
brook no serious opposition . . .”
It is worth recalling the dilemma
which faced Mr. McEwen in Parliament.
With the Chamber of Manufactures
meeting in annual conference in Can-
berra, the new champion of industry-
in-trouble, Dr. Jim Cairns (Labor, Vic-
toria), really turned on a sparkling
protectionist performance in the Parlia-
ment. The manufacturers thought he
was just marvellous. It was not just that
he himself tore into the Tariff Board
for the umpteenth time. He obliged
the manufacturers by putting on the
star protectionist performer, Mr. Jack
McEwen no less. For the best part of
a year now the manufacturers have
been missing their old favorite. With his
Party infected by terrible liberal ideas,
and the tariff reformers gaining all
around, Mr. McEwen played it safe and
shut up to the anguish of
manufacturers-in-trouble and their
lobby groups. .
During his Leader’s disastrous censure


debate three weeks ago, Dr. Cairns
forgot the general Labor Party attack
on the Government and worked
systematically to draw Mr. McEwen
into the debate. He taunted him, called
hun chicken, a has-been only interested
in honeymooning these days. But Mr.
McEwen kept his temper and refused
to be provoked. He kept out of trouble.
But now it was a different matter.
Dr. Cairns worked meticulously to
prepare the debate and get a line-up
of Labor speakers. Still the Govern-
ment was putting in its lightweights
only and the indications were that Mr.
McEwen wouldn’t speak. At the last
moment, just before the debate was due
to begin, Dr. Cairns went to the Gov-
ernment Whip, Mr. Dudley Irwin, and
threatened to call the whole Labor
team out unless Mr. McEwen would
speak. And he repeated his charges of
cowardice into the bargain. That did
the trick.
“Black Jack” was finally provoked,
and he went right back to the pro-
tectionist position. It started like an
election speech with a recital of the
growth and development of the
economy under the benevolent guidance
of the Government and its policies. But
as it proceeded it converted into N a
vicious rubbishing of the Tariff Board
and the threat that, unless it stuck to
the old tailor-to-fit industry by industry
tariff-making, the Government wouldn’t
take any notice of Board recommenda-
tions. He rubbished the Board, saying
its members were not eminent men and
that this could be seen by their salaries.
The Government had seen fit to reject
the recommendations of the Vernon
Committee, which he alleged was
staffed by men of greater stature. So
why should it respect the Tariff Board?
He raised the old furphy that “the
future of the entire structure of Aus-
tralian primary and secondary industry”
might somehow be threatened by the
Tariff Board’s new procedures and
criteria.
But there was Party disunity every-
where. Labor’s Bill Hayden, the obvious
replacement for the tired Frank Crean
as shadow-Treasurer, disagreed strongly
with Dr. Cairns’ opportunist line. He
made a thoughtful speech supporting
the Board, and he was followed by Mr.
Tony Street, a Victorian Liberal, who
said he was “seriously disturbed” by
the implications of Mr. McEwen’s
attitude. He made our point that Mr.
McEwen appeared to have diverged
from the Prime Minister’s statement
of Government policy. Then came
Labor’s Tom Uren, to challenge his
colleague Mr. Hayden and his opponent
Mr. Street, and finally reformer Don
Maiscy, of the Country Party. Poor
Andrew Peacock, Liberal, wanted to
get in and attack his colleagues Street
and Maisey, but the Speaker gagged
the debate. It would have all been much
more orderly if Party labels had been
abandoned and the two teams lined
themselves up as Reformers and
Reactionaries.
Speculator’s Diary
STRAYING AGAIN FROM
THE GOLDEN RULES
ON OIL INVESTMENTS
ONE OF THE GOLDEN rules in old
Speculator’s almanack is that you
should always invest in an oil-searching
company just before it starts drilling
and sell just before the well reaches its
most interesting levels. This is based
on the view that there is no oil in the
well, anyway, but that the market’s
hope that there is will be enough to
push the shares up. A refinement of this
approach, for those who have faith (or
for those who would kick themselves to
death if there really were oil down the
well), is to sell enough shares to cover
costs after they have moved up a little,
but then to hold the remainder for
nothing. This way you make a lot less,
if there really is oil there, than if you
had held on to them all; but you also
lose absolutely nothing if the well turns
out to be a duster. And let’s remember
that all but very few of the hundreds
of oil wells dug in and around Australia
have failed to find oil. Plaving said all
that, it’s worth wfhile pointing out that I
ignored my own advice in the case of
Oil Search earlier this year and paid
the penalty. There are now' 3000 Oil
Search shares in my portfolio at an
average price of 88 dents compared
to current prices of 58 cents. This $9OO
loss should have been enough to keep
me to the straight and narrow.
But not a bit of it; I’m straying again,
because I’m a little surprised to see
how r quickly the Woodside group is
getting along with its new' Dampier well
off the Western Australian coast. I was
too hasty a couple of weeks ago w'hen I
sold my Woodside at $1.95, for I had
not imagined that the well could be dug
at the rate of 1300 ft. a w r eek, which
was its performance last w'eek. At this
rate, the w'ell will probably be getting
around the level of Barrow' Island’s
Windalia sands in only a couple of
weeks. There seems every chance that
it will strike at least something at round
about the 3500-4500 ft. zone. As with
the successful Legendre well, the
operator will probably simply report
having struck some traces of hydro-
carbons and go on to complete the w'ell
before testing any interesting levels. This
may all take quite some time, but I’ll
bet that a simple announcement of
discovery of some hydrocarbons will be
enough to kick these shares along quite
a bit, now that the market understands
what this sort of announcement really
means.
It could be quite a nice Christmas
present, so I’m going to ignore my own
advice once again and will hold on to
this stock as the well gets deeper. The
reason I picked Mid-Eastern rather than
Woodside is simply because of the
mathematics of the operation in this
offshore area, and I’m completely
the other interests of the group
or the financial backing of the com-
panies. After Woodside’s one-for-one
issue, it will have 58 million shares
covering a 25 percent interest in the
area; Mid-Eastern has just about l-3rd
as many shares covering an 8 l-3rd
percentage holding in the area or
exactly l-3rd of Woodside’s holding. In
other words, Woodside and Mid-
Eastern are roughly equal in their stake
per share in the well now being drilled.
But it costs a lot more to buy Woodside
shares than it does to buy Mid-Eastern.
For instance, one Woodside share at
$2.30 entitles the holder to another
contributing share on the payment of 10
cents. So, for a total of $2.40, a holder
ends up with two shares (one fully paid
and one contributing). Ignoring the
contributing element, this means that
each share will have an average cost
of $1.20 (with another 40 cents to pay
on the contributing shares!).
In order to pay the $16,032 dividend
that was declared in last week’s annual
report, there has had to be so'me fairly
drastic disposals, some of them of stocks
that I was reluctant to part with. In
reducing the portfolio back down to
$lO,OOO, out went such stocks as Mt.
Isa, at a loss of $5, half my holding
of Associated Continental Petroleum at
a loss of $127, l-3rd of my 1 holding
of Alliance Petroleum at a profit of
$ll, half my Western Mining Corpora-
tion holding at a loss of $lO3, the
remainder of my Concrete Industries
holding at a profit of $378 (making
this one of my more profitable ven-
tures), International Resistance at a
profit of $37, McDonald Industries at a
profit of $22, Metals Exploration at a
profit of $65, the remainder of my
Exoil options at a profit of $l5O, and
the balance of my Genoa options at a
profit of $133. The net result of all
these sales was a profit of $561.
Kitty now stands at $306 in the red.

BRIEFLY
The economy ; Playing off the top of the bat, and to a
very mixed reception, the Prime Minister, Mr.
Gorton, and the Federal Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, jointly
declared the Government’s belief that “shareholders of
an Australian company should have the right to amend the
company’s articles of association for the purpose of
ensuring that control of the company, exercised through
the voting power of the shareholders, remains in Australian
hands.” Mr. C. T. Looker, president of the Australian
Associated Stock Exchanges, is to present this view
to the Exchanges, which have up till now frowned on
restricted voting rights.
For the first five months of the 1968-69 year, to
November, Australia’s overseas trading figures are showing
a deficit of $197 million, against the corresponding
$71.5 million for 1967-68; in each month of 1968-69,
the deficit has moved above $3O million.
October saw 15,400 permanent settlers arrive in Australia,
suggesting that total immigration may reach some 160,000
in 1968-69 the highest since 1945.
The markets: Bids, counterbids, and sundry defensive
moves still provide the main provocation to excitement on
Australian share markets. Outside their ambit, most
investment sections appear rather quiet, although the
moderate strengthening of second-line industrials is
continuing. Miners and oils still look variable.
Investors perhaps over-reacted to the Marlin trouble,
but will have more to wrestle with in Esso-BHP’s new oil
forecasts; over the week BHP went down 45 cents to
$19.20. Other declines included Western Mining $10.40
(down 50 cents), Peko $9.76 (22 cents), and CGFA $7.60
(20 cents). King Island Scheelite put on 30 cents to
reach $16.40.
Drug Houses stayed at $2, while Slater Walker lost
30 cents to finish at $5.70. General Industries slipped back
5 cents to $1.65; Pitt Son kept up, adding 28 cents and
closing at $2.40. APA, well in the line of fire but blazing
away, rose by $2.68 to $9.80.
Equities seemed reasonably steady in London; gilts,
however, are taking heavy knocks.
After three losing sessions, Wall Street bounced on to
a Friday rally with good economic prospects ahead.
Companies: The first-come-first-served technique knows
no bounds, for it struck the hyper-solid in the shape of
life assurance and money market group APA Holdings,
asking for 10 percent of its capital; the unknown bidder
and a defensive buyer, however, met reluctant shareholders
and a board which opposed by means of a 1-for-l
bonus issue . . . Under siege to the U.K.’s Redland, which
has already secured 40 percent of its shares, Concrete
Industries will try to limit the voting rights of foreign
shareholders; Redland describes this as “a futile exercise”
. . . On the more orthodox front, London-based Australian
Mercantile Land and Finance, fighting back against
Mr. Gordon Barton’s Tjuringa Securities skyrockets its
assets to £stg.9 million more than book values and
well above the bid ... A formal bid by Kempthorne Mistral
for Lawrence and Hanson turns out to be 16 cents a
share less than KM’s original first-come-first-served
offer . . . Suffering from, an Industrial Equity first-come-
first-served, which captured about 25 percent of capital, New
Redhead Estate and Coal now has a cash bid from Hooker
Corporation worth $1,627,134.
The extractors were somewhat cast down by Esso-BHP’s
Marlin blow-up and at the week’s close had to face a
sharp cut in estimates of oil output from both Marlin
and Barracouta fields; the partners now plan to start
delivering oil in August, 1969, and not the previously forecast
March . . . But BHP’s Groote Eylandt manganese
production will be expanded from 400,000 to one million
tons a year, the extra being mostly destined for
export ... A plethora of expansion for EZ Industries may
call for the spending of around $5O million over five
years, so a share issue will probably “be related to the
overall timing of our plans” . . . Ardlethan Tin can’t pay
an interim dividend as a consequence of a loss for the
“20 weeks ended November 16,” despite some
improvement in tin prices . . . The Pleasant Hills gas
field may happily become the biggest in the Roma
(Queensland) region, Associated Continental Petroleum
shareholders learnt at their annual meeting.
Financial institutions haven’t been backward ... A
healthy advance in underwriting surplus helped Queensland
Insurance send earnings up by 3.3 percent to $2,208,656;
almost without saying, the share portfolio’s market
value jumped by $6,517,826 to $26,336,405 . . . Next year
is to see the long-bruited flotation of United Dominions
Corporation (Australia), now wholly owned by the British
United Dominions Trust; the Australian equity will be
between 25 and 30 percent
Earlier expansion has obviously benefited Commonwealth
Industrial Gases, whose profit went from $3,111,954 to
$3,384,779, enabling dividend to move up by 1 percent to
12 percent after a l-for-5 bonus which takes the
final 6| percent ... It was retreat, however, for ACF and
Shirleys Fertilisers, where earnings dropped from
$838,377 to $687,347, bringing earning rate down to 9.1
percent to support the 8£ percent dividend . . . Austral-
Pacific Fertilisers is all confidence and proposes to launch
its $62 million phosphate fertiliser plant two years ahead
of program . . . Capital spending and expansion lead Dunlop
Australia into a l-for-7 par issue and a $l4 million
debenture issue, in which shareholders get priority; total
raisings become $20,350,000.

THE FIRST-COME
FIRST-SERVED DEBATE
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
THE SHEER AUDACITY of the
anonymous $8.50 a share first-come-
first-served bid for about 10 percent of
APA Holdings Ltd.’s issued capital has
focused the sharemarket’s attention on
this method of market raiding. In the
case of APA the directors moved with
commendable speed and skill to thwart
the first-come-first-served raider. They
announced plans for a 1-for-l bonus
issue, with a small inci'ease in the
effective dividend rate in terms of
present shareholdings, and this should
provide them with powerful backing.
The bonus issue, the first share issue
since 1964 (which was also a 1-for-l
bonus), and the new dividend rate of
9 percent on the doubled capital
(equivalent to 18 percent a year on
present capital compared with the cur-
rent rate of 17 percent) will ensure
overwhelming support for the board at
this week’s annual general meeting.
Market prices also rose steeply, once
touching $10.30 for each $1 share,
blocking the move. Prompt and spirited
defence and sharemarket reaction seem
to have totally defeated the raider.
However, it is likely that first-come-
first-served (“FCFS”) attacks on the
more vulnerable companies will con-
tinue. The first-come-first-served form
of market raiding is relatively novel to
Australia, but it is certainly catching
on. Following the “FCFS” raid on
Strata Development in June, 1967, there
have been 25 similar bids on the Aus-
tralian Stock Exchanges.
The companies raided include Astor
Hotel Motel, H. C. Heathorn and Co.
(Tasmanian motor vehicles distribu-
tor), Palladium Investment, Australia
Hotel, Sterling Henry, Co-Operative
Motors, Direct Acceptance, Lithgow
Valley Collieries, Vanderfield and Reid,
Rigneys Holdings, Talcott Factors,
Endurance Tin, Perpetual Insurance, A 1
Consolidated, Duro Travel, Chapmans
Ltd., York Motors, New Redhead
Estate, Lawrence and Flanson, Casben
Productions, City Bricks, and some
others.
It is pretty clear that most of the
share market views “FCFS” tactics with
obvious displeasure and suspicion,
ranging all the way to frank, and almost
mystic, abhorrence. The fact that the
City of London takeover code disallows
“FCFS” methods has little more to do
with the situation in Australia than
the fact that it was formulated after
many years of experience and that
historical and emotional ties with
London are, naturally enough, still
strong on the Australian Stock
Exchanges. However, it is pointed out
that “FCFS” puts the boards and share-
holders of the raided companies at a
disadvantage of such proportions as to
be considered unfair.
In the first place, the first-come-first-
served buying order is not really an
offer but merely an indication that the
broker acting for the bidder will pur-
chase a certain number of shares at a
certain price if they are offered to him,
and that the shares will be bought
strictly in the order in which they are
offered. Usually, but not necessarily,
the identity of the principal for whom
the broker is acting is not disclosed.
This helps to create an atmosphere not
only of extreme urgency but also builds
up considerable tension, since the
“FCFS” bids are usually made at a
price which is above the ruling market
price at the time. This can stampede
the shareholders into hasty decision, at
the same time subjecting the board to
very intensive pressure.
Moreover, since these bids are usually
made only for a fraction of the capital,
only the most alert shareholders keenly
observing market moves are likely to
get full benefit of the higher prices
offered by the bid. Such factors as mail
to country areas and other delays in
the news of the bid reaching all the
shareholders begin to play an important
part. Another vital point is that, despite
the fact that a “FCFS” bid is usually
made for a relatively small percentage
of the total capital, its final effect may
be a takeover of the company con-
cerned by an anonymous bidder.
And, of course, the “FCFS” method
can be used to avoid the strict takeover
provisions of the Companies Act.
On the other hand, there are other
relevant points which must be con-
sidered. Apart from the fact that any
novelty inevitably provokes unfavorable
conservative reaction, most of the com-
panies which have been subjected to
“FCFS” raids so far fall into a definite
pattern. They are small- to medium-
sized companies with a high formal net
tangible asset backing for their shares
but often relatively low and static
market price, fairly low earnings, and
a conservative attitude to shareholders.
At least ten of the victims did not pay
a dividend in the financial year just
before they were raided. There are
notable exceptions from this pattern,
APA being one of the most obvious, but
the majority seem to fall into the
“market plodders” category. This makes
them vulnerable to takeover bids, any-
way. In the case of “FCFS” raids, the
high asset backing compared to the
market price of shares seems to be an
essential factor.
In some cases a proportion of share-
holders in the companies raided have
been given a chance to sell their shares
at a price which has averaged out at
about 40 percent above the ruling
market price. In some cases the market
price has followed the “raider’s ceiling,”
and more shareholders were able to
dispose of their shares at a higher price,
probably the only chance they had for
quite some time. This violates the
principle of equal opportunities for all
shareholders, but at least in some cases
these opportunities did not really
amount to much before the raid.
In most cases it is true that an
efficient, well-earning company whose
shares command a good market price
is an unlikely target for “FCFS” bids,
THE CHARTIST SAYS: GENERAL INDUSTRIES LTD. was first
reviewed with the electrical group in 1966. It was then pointed out that the worst
appeared to be over and it was forming a base with a strong resistance level about
$1.45. Prices continued to fluctuate, and the low point of $1 “tested” a long-term
support line. Very heavy turnover has moved prices up to a high of $1.95 in recent
weeks, and there is usually a reaction back to a flat top resistance level, which
now becomes a support level. There are targets of approximately $2.20 and $2.50
for this stock, and after that it would be a case for trending. Last sale price on
5/12/68—51.65.

although the APA case disturbs this
pattern.
The practice, despite all the reserva-
tions against it, is legal under present
legislation. The question is whether the
legislation should be amended to tighten
it against “FCFS” moves. This may be,
as yet, a bit premature, as the practice
may in due course work itself out into
becoming a method of acquiring the
whole or part of such companies as are
“better dead than alive” through the
action of normal, healthy market forces
alone. APA’s vigorous counter-action
will both benefit its shareholders and
also help ward off similar plans against
efficient and healthy companies.
However, even now it is worth con-
sidering whether a means of enforcing
compulsory identification of the bidder
need not be found. Unfortunately, this
once again rubs on the festering prob-
lem of nominee companies and can
hardly be decided unless this whole area
of sharemarket activity is critically
reviewed by the legislators.
MELBOURNE EXCHANGE
THE FLUCTUATING YEAR
IN THESE DAYS OF swinging and
exciting share markets, annual reports
of the various capital city Stock
Exchanges bear more of a historical
look and flavor than they did when
Australian money markets were less
sophisticated and financial reporting less
adventuresome and interpretive. If
they dared to cast their minds back
over the year to the end of September,
for which the Stock Exchange of Mel-
bourne issued its report last week,
investors would come up with memories
of speculation running riot, of for-
tunes won and lost. The fact that, as
the report recounts, the market value
of shares listed in the oil search and
mining section of the market was 78
percent higher at the end than at the
start of the year would, for brokers
and clients alike, have little significance,
camouflaging a multitude of highly
fluctuating experiences.
At the end of the year, market
capitalisation of industrials (the bread-
and-butter section) at $12,327 million
(an increase of 27 percent) was still well
over double that $5396 million (up 78
percent) for minerals shares. If the bulk
of the year’s business was transacted in
these two dominating areas, it was also
highly satisfactory that sales of deben-
tures rose by 46 percent to $24.8 million
—the highest since 1954. Against this,
turnover in bonds dropped by 5 percent
to $2167 million, which is rather sur-
prising in the light of the bigger hold-
ings of the short-term money market
over the year. As it happened last year,
the number of new companies listed
just about cancelled out the nu'mber
dropping out of the lists, leaving the


total number listed one lower at 889,
for which there were 303,003 - separate
securities whose market value at end
September was $28,202 million, or
nearly double their nominal value.
Sketching in the economic influences
behind last year’s market performance
and looking a bit ahead, the report
naturally highlights minerals discoveries
and capital inflow, and points a warn-
ing finger at inflationary tendencies
which need watching in view of the
balance of payments position. Pointing
out that, in the last five years, annual
net apparent capital inflow has more
than doubled (from $496 million to
$1136 million last year), the report
finds the more than trebling (up 325
percent) in the sa'me period of the
turnover (by value) in mining and
industrial shares on the Exchange no
mere coincidence.
UNITED PACKAGES
COMFORT IN CANS
THOSE WHO HAD predicted a steady
market appreciation for United
Packages Ltd.’s 50-cent ordinary shares
have been modestly vindicated. This
year’s closing bottom level for the
company’s shares is $1.20 a unit, only
a couple of cents below the 1967 “high”
of $1.22, while the 1968 peak price has
risen to $1.48. Seeing that one time
in 1967 UPL’s shares could have been
acquired for only 93 cents, this is not
a bad performance for an industrial
stock paying a dividend of 11 percent
and backed by $1.04 of conservatively
valued net tangible assets for every 50
cent unit.
The margin of market-price variations
has narrowed down somewhat, making
it harder to make a quick profit, but the
medium- and long-term investors can
feel comfortable with some UPLs in
their portfolios. The “one-year buyer”
also has little to complain about when
making an annual review of his stocks
just before Christmas. One would be
rather tempted to hold on to UPL
shares and go as far as buying into
them even now with share prices just
below the 1968 “high” at about $1.46.
Since 1964-65, consolidated net
profit has lifted from $910,432 (18.4
percent on paid ordinary capital) to
$1,242,114 (22.3 percent), with one
minor retreat in 1965-66 (16.6 per-
cent). Taking 1961-62 as the starting
point, the compound annual growth
rate was 11.2 percent. At the present
market price of $1.46 the capital issue
is priced at 13.8 times the 1967-68
earnings and is yielding 3.8 percent.
The 11 percent annual dividend is 1.9
times covered.
Known for a long time as Queens-
land Can before its name was changed
to United Packages Ltd., to reflect its
growing nation-wide interests, the
company is characterised by constant
attention to diversification and a sound
investment policy of acquiring hold-
ings in its customer companies. Mainly
known as a producer of cans, a field
with a high expansion potential, UPL
is also a large manufacturer of
various types of collapsible packages,
paper, fibreboard and plastic containers,
and of PVC building sheets. Its
customers include Queensland’s old-
established biggest brewer, the mighty
Castlemaine Perkins Ltd. (the XXXX
brand). Turnover for the first four
months of 1968-69 has increased by
14 percent, compared with the previous
corresponding period, and the company
is entering 1969 with excellent
prospects for high earnings and further
expansion.
The fact that about 14 percent of
UPL’s capital is held by nominee com-
panies—with the board knowing only
some of- the principals—is a factor to
keep in mind, but the company seems
GROUPED HOLDINGS AUSTRALIA LIMITED
MERCHANT BANKERS
Mr. A. C. Goode, at the Annual General Meeting of Grouped Holdings Australia Limited held on the 19th
November, said, inter alia:
"During the financial year which ended 30th
June, 1968, there was a period of further expansion
for the Group of Companies controlled by, or
associated closely with, Grouped Holdings Australia
Limited. Although the non-recurrent disturbance
caused by devaluation and the consequental fall
in security prices, coupled with other international
uncertainities, temporarily reduced profits earned
by the Official Short Term Money Market com-
panies in Australia, earnings by the other operating
companies increased and the consolidated profits of
Grouped Holdings Australia Limited showed little
change. The current year has opened on a good
basis for the Official Money Market companies in
Australia and in New Zealand, and income from
merchant banking activities should be good. It
would appear that fiscal 1969 should be favourable
for Grouped Holdings Australia Limited.
Last year's downturn in the earnings of Short
Term Money companies, coupled with the need for
funds for group expansion, led the Directors of
Grouped Holdings Australia Limited to omit the
bonus of one percent paid in the previous year,
while maintaining the basic dividend of 8 per cent,
which was easily covered by earnings on ordinary
capital of 14.3 per cent. As a matter of general
policy at this stage of rapid growth in the Aus-
tralian economy, the Directors would prefer to lift
earnings rather than dividend payment, because the
Group can make considerable use of retained profits
in present conditions to finance continued growth
without recourse to shareholders.
As indicated earlier in the Address, the Directors
look with confidence to the results of the current
year, whilst stressing the very uncertain nature of
Western World finances."

far too dynamic and well managed for

attacks.
The last capital increase was a one-
for-ten at par in 1965-66 and the last
bonus issue was a one-for-five in Decem-
ber, 1961. It appears that the question
of a new issue may have to be con-
sidered reasonably soon by the board.
More capital is needed for expansion,
and shareholders are entitled to hope
that they would be given an opportunity
to contribute to any future major fund-
raising. This would both enhance the
company’s attractive image and serve
a warning to potential takeover bidders
from whom hardly any company in
Australia seems immune at the moment.
Takeover fears in respect of UPL
appear preposterous at the moment,
but the company’s very dynamism,
earning capacity, and managerial skill,
coupled with the fact that it operates
in several strategic fields in the
packaging industry, point to the need
of constant vigilance.
Even a modest issue to shareholders
—-who have been well looked after—
could be a wise and generous move
viewing the company in the perspective
of the next year or two.

ITS ON THE LIST NOW:
A PICTURE OF
HAWKSTONE'S PROSPECTS
THE ADVENT of Hawkstone
Minerals to the Sydney list a few weeks
ago was accompanied by very little
publicity. Shares in the company had
previously been quoted on the Perth
Exchange for a few months and the
chairman’s address released just prior
to listing provides a fairly compre-
hensive picture of the company. Hawk-
stone Minerals held petroleum leases
off the west coast of Western Australia
and assigned these to Abrolhos Oil in
return for 1,922,000 Abrolhos Oil
shares. Subsequently, Hawkstone
changed its name to Hawkstone Min-
erals and directed itself to prospecting
activities in the west.
With a team of four geologists, it has
obtained mineral claims and options over
claims covering a number of prospects.
In the Weebo area, 11 mineral claims
totalling some 3300 acres are currently
held under option. Surface geological
mapping, sampling and assaying on a
large occurrence of ultra-basic (serpen-
tine) rocks in conjunction with meta-
morphics, has confirmed encouraging
indications of nickels and some copper
mineralisation, and a greatly expanded
program for the detailed examination
of this area is now under way. In the
Lake Raeside area, 2 mineral claims
comprising 600 acres are currently
held under option; these claims are corn-

pletely surrounded by areas held by
International Nickel Southern Explor-
ation Limited and the company’s
geologists have been carrying out a
preliminary appreciation of the area.
In the Nepean area, south of Cool-
gardie, where Metals Exploration is
currently drilling, the company holds
an option over one mineral claim and
has several others under offer, while
in the north of the State it has been
offered a 50 percent interest in a small
silver/lead mining operation, east of
Ex’mouth, which is the subject of a
feasibility study, while in the Pilbara it
is also prospecting for manganese and
other minerals. The company itself has
been offered a 15 percent interest in
Longreach Manganese, which has
recently purchased the assets of the
Mt. Sydney Mining Company. This
property is one of the major manganese
ore producers of Australia and has
been operating at Woodie Woodie in the
Pilbara district since 1954, extracting
since that time almost half a million
tons of high-grade metallurgical man-
ganese ore. Contracts are held for the
export of ore to Japan, and it is likely
that Longreach will develop the area
by increasing production facilities and
proving up further reserves, which at
present encompass one million tons of
indicated ore plus 1.2 million tons of
inferred ore.
Part of the assets purchased from the
British Metal Corporation, previous
owners of this operation, include 18
mineral claims at Ripon Hills, some 70
miles from Woodie Woodie (as the
crow flies), which have been estimated
to contain some 60 million tons of
ferruginous manganese ore i.e.,
manganese ore which has a high iron
content. The average grade of the
Ripon Hills deposits has been sampled
at 22 percent manganese and 24 per-
cent iron. While marketable ore requires
grades of 30-35 percent manganese and
18-22 percent iron, Longreach appears
fairly confident that it can upgrade the
ore by getting rid of the fine material
which contains a high proportion of
the iron and other impurities and hopes
that the Japanese steel industry will
provide a market for this product. In
this regard, it is to some extent hang-
ing its hat on further development of
the Pilbara district by people such as
the Mt. Goldsworthy Iron Ore venture,
and more particularly the extension in
some years’ ti'me of the 'Goldsworthy
railway to iron-ore deposits farther to
the south of its existing operation; at
the present time all that the company
will be doing is to increase production
from the Woodie Woodie deposits to
200,000 tons per annum over the next
three years and further prove up the
large low-grade deposit at Ripon Hills.
Prior to the formation of Abrolhos
Oil, Hawkstone had a relatively
modest capital which moved up to
$263,000 in 25 cent shares. To finance
its mineral operations, particularly the
interest in Longreach Manganese, a

interest in Abrolhos Oil and thus joins
the Longreach Group which now
consists of Longreach Oil itself, Long-
reach Metals, Abrolhos Oil, and Hawk-
stone Minerals. The four companies
are to share management and technical
staffs to a large degree, and it is
expected that there will be joint parti-
cipation among the members of the
group in. any new ventures.
Longreach Oil itself is in the middle
of an issue to shareholders (on a one-
for-two entitlement basis) of shares in
Longreach Metals. This corhpany is
acquiring all the mineral interests of
Longreach Oil and is issuing 7,000,000
shares of 50 cents paid to 25 cents to
shareholders of Longreach Metals
(Longreach Oil retaining a further
11,000,000 shares). The main prospect,
apart from the manganese areas held
by Longreach Manganese, are the
copper deposits in the region between
Mt. Isa and Cloncurry, where several
small deposits have been encountered,
containing up to 10,000 tons of oxid-
ised copper ore. The area itself is an
important copper province and con-
tinued work is expected to encounter
further deposits of a size sufficient to
service a central treatment plant.
Longreach Metals’ other prospects are
at Pine Creek, 140 miles south east of
Darwin, where a gold prospect is
being investigated; in northern Queens-
land, near Mareeba, where the com-
pany is to test for alluvial and under-
ground tin; and inland from Bowen,
where the company has already relin-
quished half of a lease held some 130
miles inland. The 110 square miles
retained could possibly turn up small
but rich mineralisation capable of
supporting small mines close to a
central plant.

18 percent. This assumes no improve-

ex-accountant, Mr. Donald Junor, is
capable of stretching itself to produce
a more attractive result than that.

solidly founded on food manufacturing
(and there is nothing more basic than
that), with vertical integration into its
packaging, and engineering. Mr. Junor
is keenly aware of opportunities within
the industry and his planning is geared
to take advantage of them. His most
important move in a long time was the
exchange of shares with the Islands
trader, retailer, and investor Burns
Philp, which was interpreted firstly as
expansionary, secondly as defensive.
The 18 percent equity which Burns
Philp now holds in Mauri Bros, should
stave off any cheeky takeover bids, and
Mauri Bros.’ 9.2 percent stake in
Burns Philp apparently gives that larger
concern some comfort, too.
Although many of Australia’s food
manufacturers have been swallowed by
American and British companies, there
are plenty of small ones ready to seek
protection and deliverance from the
tax man and creditors in Mauri Bros,
fold. In the past few years Mauri has
bought out the stock, fixed assets, and
goodwill of a number of private (and
public) firms, chiefly in butchers’
supplies and drinking straws.
The company suggests that most of
these acquisitions are initiated by the
vendor, but it did, anyhow, make the
first move in the takeover of Captain
Products, which had been the subject of
takeover rumors earlier. The fish pro-
ducts of Captain fit nicely into Mauri
Bros.’ range, and could boost Mauri
Bros.’ profits by $371,000, judging
by 1968 performance, which was a
good improvement on past years.
Captain, with tight capital of $928,000
and a record of high and growing earn-
ings, was a tasty morsel. It was a pity
that Mauri Bros.’ organisational struc-
ture prevented it from using its share
premium to full advantage by settling
the purchase fully in shares.
Since 1965 Mauri Bros, has operated
through divisions rather than subsidi-
aries. The chief operating company,
Mauri Bros, and Tho'mson (Aust.) Pty.
Ltd., had to offer $4.05 cash per Captain
share, a total $3,758,400, while the
holding company offered to allot seven
shares for each Captain share at par,
which on current market price of $1.84
for Mauri Bros, is worth another $l.BB
per Captain share. The $650,000 which
would be received from Captain share-
holders will partly offset the cash to be
paid out, but the net cash payment for
Mauri Bros, is still a hefty $3,108,000,
with a continuing dividend obligation of
$65,000 a year. Part of the bait in this
fish story is Captain’s own cash riches.
Captain’s 1968 balance sheet was not
released, but on the 1967 showing there
was $f million in listed investments,
$643,000 in secured loan, $lOO,OOO in
deposits, and a working capital ratio,
not counting these, of 4.4 to one. It is
understood that the 1968 position
showed a slight improvement on this.

say, $1.5 million of Captain’s invest-

trading arrangements (no increase in
creditors), Mauri Bros.’ indebtedness to
bankers (which had grown from $3
million to $4.86 million last year) might
be lifted to $6,268,000. (Against the
$3.1 million payment to Captain share-
holders, the company has $200,000 com-
ing in from employees for shares.)
The company is not acting as if it is
short of cash. In Nove’mber, Mauri Bros,
bought for cash Henry Jones’ 50 percent
share in the Australasian Pickle Co.
Nestle is its partner in Champion’s
Vinegar and Crane Packing Co., of
Illinois, and Tube Investments, of
London, in John Crane Mauri Pty. Ltd.,
which has a plastics division in Victoria
and makes industrial seals and packings,
and fabrilon in N.S.W.
Mauri Bros. denies considera-
tion of a share issue or long-term bor-
rowings, and declares that all planned
expenditure will be financed internally.
At least its capital commitments, con-
tracts entered into but not paid for by
balance date, show a big falling-off for
the current year. At 1965 balance date
the figure footnoted in the accounts was
$1,330,000, $1,066,000 in 1966,
$993,000 in 1967, and down to $451,000
in 1968. The big expenditure, on
which very little has been said, was the
purchase a couple of years ago of 239
acres of land at Altona, to relocate Vic-
torian manufacturing activities. This
area was designed to serve the com-
pany 100 years ahead. So far only five
operations with outmoded or outgrown
premises have been relocated to indi-
vidual buildings at Altona, with one
more to go this year. The thinking is
that a multitude of small operations is
more manageable and therefore more
efficient than a big complex. This
principle has certainly proved effective
for this group in the past. The net
increase in book value of undepreciated
freehold and leasehold properties in the
two years 1966 to 1968 was $2,154,000
to $10,819,000, although there have
been sales of freehold, notably in 1968
when a surplus of $96,000 was realised.
There was a net increase in undepre-
ciated plant, fixtures, and motor-
vehicles of $463,000 in the past year,
and $1,208,000 in the past two years,
so the greater expenditure has been in
property, rather than plant where there
would have been investment allowances
for tax purposes.
In the course of time there must be a
relocation of Sydney manufacturing and
engineering activities also. The largest
single operation, PMU Products, is at
Newtown, while the refrigeration works
are at Waterloo, flavorings and
aromatics at Homebush, and so on.
Partly boosted by the takeover of
PMU in 1961, and Winn Food Products
and Greig’s Honey in 1965, the Mauri
Bros.’ product range now includes rye
flour, citrus juice, fruit drinks and
essences, yeast, pickles, vinegar, honey,
ginger, fruit peel and cherries, sauces
and canned foods. Additionally, it
supplies mild- and stainless-steel equip-

ment and refrigeration to the food and
beverage industries, and crown seals to
the bottling trade. (The trend to
canned drinks has not yet affected
Mauri’s seal business. Mauri thinks
that, although there has been much
publicity, cans have not made much
headway.) Unlike Heinz and Rosella,
who handed over their can-making busi-
ness to the canners on a plate, PMU
makes all its own cans.
Mauri’s reticence and conservatism
are well known. Until the new Com-
panies Act, group profits and tax pro-
vision were not divulged. The printed
accounts are models of brevity. The
company obviously has no thought of
building an Australian image with the
consumer public, and consumers would
be hard put to it to identify the com-
pany, although its products go into
most Australian homes. The balance
sheet is streamlined by the elimination
each year of any goodwill that arises
from takeovers, and to date the com-
pany has never borrowed from the
public. The properties are entirely
unencumbered. Plant is depreciated to
34 percent of cost.
With predictable regularity, the com-
pany makes bonus issues when the
dividend gets up to 11 percent. Asset
revaluations provided the means for
the one-for-two bonus in October, 1956,
and the three one-for-four bonuses in
December, 1960, September, 1964, and
September, 1968. The interlocking
arrangement with Burns Philp ties
Mauri to a 10 percent dividend for 1969,
although on past patterns the company
might have been expected to revert to
9 or 9| percent. Possibly Mauri’s divi-
dend policy and attitude to bonuses will
in future be influenced by the association
with Burns Philp. The two companies
have a lot in common—respectability,
conservatism, solidity, and little appre-
ciation of the virtues of public relations.
Burns Philp’s widespread channels of
distribution in the Islands, in N.S.W.
country stores, and through a major
shareholding in G. J. Coles, do com-
plement Mauri Bros, manufacturing
and packaging interests in Australia and
New Zealand. Mauri Bros, is quick to
point out that Burns Philp is not tied
to them, so areas for their early
co-operation are not immediately
obvious, although both parties expect
considerable financial benefit over the
years. And they are both shrewd
parties.
The exchange of two million Burns
Philp $1 shares at $1.25 for five million
Mauri Bros, shares at 50c appeared to
favor Mauri, for Mauri saw an immedi-
ate paper profit of $7.5 million on its
investment, compared with Burns
Philp’s $7 million.. With both com-
panies on a 10 percent dividend, the
$250,000 dividend involved is can-
celled out. The new shares do not rank
for current year’s interim dividend,
which is some consolation for existing
shareholders, feeling that their equity
has been watered, and chances of a
takeover virtually eliminated. Mauri’s

capital will be enlarged from $8.6
million to $14,116,000 by the Septem-
ber bonus, the issue to Captain share-
holders, to Burns Philp, and $200,000
to employees.
As the Captain takeover is not yet
finalised, a good part of its 1968-69
profits will be pre-acquisition profits
for Mauri, although the second part of
Captain’s year including Lent is prob-
ably the more profitable. No indication
is given as to the company’s current
trading, apart from the chairman’s
quiet optimism.
Shareholders in the past have had
to have a fair amount of blind faith
in management, and this is still true
today. If an investor insists on seeing
where his company is heading, he
should seek another stock. The associa-
tion with Burns Philp may bring long-
range benefits to Mauri Bros, but the
immediate prospects for other share-
holders seem diminished rather than
enhanced. The shares normally move
within a narrow price range and they
will not be depressed by the small
issue in respect of Captain, so there is
no quick dollar to be made.

WIGMORES' HAPPY RIDE
ON THE WEST'S
MINING GRAVY TRAIN
THE 19th-CENTURY goldrushes
made many men poorer but wiser.
Storekeepers who set up shop on the
diggings were already wise, and con-
sequently became rich by supplying
the miners with goods. I see a lesson
in that for modern investors. Today the
mighty mining bonanza in Western
Australia is making a fortune for those
backing companies with good mineral
and oil strikes, but a lot of the in-
experienced have lost money and found
only fools’ gold (or perhaps fools’
nickel?). Investors in Western Aus-
tralian industrials, though, have no sad
tales to tell. At present their stocks are
being drawn along by the mining gravy
train, and doing very nicely in the
State’s overall boom. Even so, some
Western Australian companies still look
undervalued to me, especially Wig-
mores, which reported earnjngs of
42.3 cents per $1 share for 1967-68 and
have a current price/earnings ratio of
12.8, based on the current rights issue.
Wigmores have varied interests in
the West, including shipping, Customs,
cartage, and insurance agencies, general
merchandising, and fertiliser distribu-
tion, but by far the most important
aspect of the company’s operations is
in tractors, agricultural machinery, and
earthmoving equipment. Wigmores have
the Western Australian franchises for
Caterpillar products, agricultural
machinery produced by David Shearer
and John Shearer & Sons, and have
recently obtained distribution rights for
Ford agricultural tractors and mach-
inery in six W.A. branch areas. I under-
stand that between 80 and 90 percent
of group profit comes from Caterpillar
sales, with around 3 percent from agri-
cultural equipment and the balance
being provided by shipping, insurance,
and other trading activities.
The present company was formed in
1938 to acquire the business of H. J.
Wigmore & Co., a general merchant
dating back to 1916. In 1958 the group
established two subsidiaries, Wigmores
Tractors and Wigmores Machinery, to
handle earthmoving machines and farm
equipment respectively. Shipping
activities are based on the company’s
position as Australian agent for Kawa-
saki Risen Kaisha (“K” line), one of
the two big Japanese shipping com-
panies on the Japan/Australia run,
but Wigmores are also Western Austra-
lian agents for Clan Line Steamers,
Scottish Shire Line, and West Hartle-
pool Steam Navigation. Clan Line
is in the top three on the U.K./Australia
service. In line with overall develop-
ment, shipping is showing spectacular
growth in Western Australia. In
1964-65, the State’s overseas imports
and exports totalled $404.8 million, but
have since shot up to $680.7 million in
1967-68, an increase of 68 percent in
three years. Shipping leads logically to
Customs, cartage, and insurance work,
and the group also acts as chief repre-
sentative in W.A. for Mercantile Mutual
Insurance.
. Group results for 1967-68 show
record sales for Wigmores Tractors,
including delivery of a large number
of Caterpillar machines to iron-ore pro-
jects in the Pilbara region, where $660
million is being invested in four major
projects between 1965 and 1995.
That’s big money, but still appears
relatively puny when related to the
total underway or planned for public
and private capital investment projects
over the same period. The W.A. Gov-
ernment and other public agencies have
developments listed worth $766.9 mil-
lion, while private interests expect to
invest a cool $1348.8 million. Not all
projects will involve the use of earth-
moving machines, but the bigger ones
certainly will. For example, a record
$36.3 million is being spent by the
State Government on roads in 1968-69,
adding 712 miles of sealed highway to


NCR has solved the inventory problem.
’Tis the reason to be jolly.
If this fellow runs out of the right
merchandise this holiday season, a
lot of little people will lose faith.
An NCR Retail Automation System
for retailers makes being “out of
stock” old fashioned any time of the
year. As an automatic by-product of
recording a sale, NCR Control Regis-
ters capture essential merchandise
classification data. Then the journal
tapes from those registers are pro-
cessed at an NCR Data Processing
Centre. Your merchandising man-
agers are supplied with the up-to-the-
minute computer printed reports they
need for efficient merchandise con-
trol.
That kind of scientific inventory
control is only one advantage of an
NCR Retail Automation System. It
will also supply reports telling you
what merchandise is providing the
best profits ... or causing losses . . .
which of your bright young sales-
people is selling the most . . . and a
variety of essential management aids
too numerous to detail.here.
The surest way to avoid being
caught “out of stock” when custo-
mers are most numerous is to install
an NCR Retail Automation System.

With developments of this magnitude in
the pipeline, there seems to be rapid
growth ahead for Caterpillar equip-
ment, which is used extensively in
mining, for road building, and in
general construction. On the spare
parts side of the business, Wigmores
will also do well, as many projects are
set down for rugged country where
machine life is not expected to be more
than about three years. Replacement
the cost and profitability to the group,
sales.
Wigmores Machinery suffered a slight
downturn in 1967-68. Although the
company has not given detailed reasons
for the decline, I suspect it is related to
Wigmores’ decision surrender their 19-
year-old franchise for sole distribution
of John Deere products in Western
Australia. Following an examination of
a new agreement with John Deere and
the costs and profitability to the group,
the dealer contracts were terminated at
September 30, 1967. The recent agree-
ment with Ford should help the machin-
ery division improve its position in rela-
tion to the rest of the group. Farmers in
the State are having difficulty in com-
bating rising costs, but the value of
rural production continues to increase.
Gross value of rural production in the
West in 1967-68 rose to $431,868 million
from $412,188 million in the previous
year. Since 1964-65 the upsurge has
been in the region of $135 million.
Wheat is the West’s biggest rural earner,
and reports now coming to hand indi-
cate that W.A. is heading for a record
harvest this year. The range of Shearer
products distributed by Wigmores
covers tillage, seeding, and harvesting
machines and implements.
After the new share issue of l-for-5,
at a premium of $1.50, Wigmores will
raise capital to $2,592 million and have
a share premiu'm reserve of $930,000.
As I expect earnings to grow for some
years yet, it seems to me, and this is
only my hunch, that a bonus issue is not
far away. Investors who get in now can
probably look forward to good rewards.

a sound growth stock.


Highlights from

■M > 8 >»«««*£;
The Bank’s IBM System/360
Model 30 Computer has been de-
livered and installed in a special-
ly completed area in the new Data
Processing Centre being erected
for the Bank in Lansdowne
Street, East Melbourne.
Financing Australia’s deve-
lopment. Like other youthful,
growing nations we are hungry
for capital to use for many differ-
ent purposes. We are making a
great effort to help ourselves. In
fact, we are devoting a higher
proportion of our income to capi-
tal investment for the future than
other comparable nations, with
the exception of Japan.
Need for overseas capital.
A vital contribution to our deve-
lopment is also being made by
overseas capital. It is helping to
expand and modernise our manu-
facturing and other industries, in-
cluding the great, new mineral
enterprises. With this inflow
comes overseas “know-how” and
technical advances which are aid-
ing productive efficiency, and the
training of Australians in modern
techniques developed abroad.
We must continue to welcome
overseas capital, for we shall be
looking for a large inflow until
the end of the century, if our
country’s development is not to
be prejudiced.
Australian equity desirable.
Having in mind the excellent
prospects of our country, I be-
lieve that where practicable it
would be wise for overseas con-
cerns to provide for an appropri-
ate local sharing of interest. I
would not for a moment suggest
any form of compulsion, but it
would be a clear-sighted policy
and something which we, as Aus-
tralians, might legitimately ex-
pect.
Government borrowings
less flexible. We are fortunate
that the great bulk of overseas
capital is essentially business in
character. Government borrowing
overseas for certain purposes,
notably defence, is very neces-
sary, but its repayment, even if
predictable, has an inflexibility
which does not attach to the
great bulk of the private capital
inflow. Also, about 40% of the
earnings on private capital is
“ploughed back” into business
and kept here to help meet their
need for funds.
Drought affects savings.
The banking system is an excel-
lent repository for the savings of
•individuals in particular. Although
they are generally relatively small
in amount, banks offer complete
capital safety and the individual
is assured that his or her savings
are used productively in accord-
ance with national economic
policy. Personal savings had been
trending up until last financial
year, when the severe drought
took toll. With a restoration of
farm income, and possibly as a
result of higher wage levels, sav-
ings should increase substan-
tially in 1968/69 and act as a
bulwark against inflationary pos-
sibilities.
Liquidity and the Reserve
Bank. We are not unsympathetic
with the many problems of the
Reserve Bank, but we believe that
the low liquidity position of the
trading bank system is making
forward planning anything but
easy. More flexibility is needed,
because these days the system
has to cope with big, unavoidable
fluctuations which occur daily,
weekly and seasonally.

The geometry of fleeting emotions

t rS ln th dl , Sp ay , ° f ? spect ?
a ad an liG, the last showing, at
Garran Hall, of the Scandinavian
design exhibition, which has now visited
all capitals; and the painted wood and
iron sculpture by Edival Ramosa at the
oo rarely appreciated Australian Sculp-
ure a ery. .
Seeing once again the sparkling
Scandinavian show, I had a sombre
thought: that bad design corrupts taste
and corrodes sensibility more than bad
sculpture or bad painting because it is
not only bad but is also antipathetical
to art itself.
Edival Ramosa, a Brazilian who first
became really creatively stimulated in
Italy in 1962 when on leave from the
Brazilian UNO forces at Suez, might
look like a designer at first; the painted
sculpture is clean and clear-cut, the
uninflected matt or shiny color, whether
vivid or powdery pastel, is most accept-
able, and the forms are bold and simple.
These features, with some mild optical
ploys, could be the ingredients of polite
Bauhaus-derived design, but amid all
the calculated geometry and bland color
lurk metaphors of feelings. A clue is
given by the small Object, made of
eight movable blocks in radiant yellow,
c ' ims °"’ "ft and " ith
designs emblazoned on them and owned
by the Brazilian Ambassador, Senhora
Marganda Guedes Nogueira,. who was
responsible for bringing this exhibition
and that of 16 Brazilian printmakers to
Australia. When the gaudy blocks are
pulled apai% a hollo w h / art sh is
rev ealed, and that is the heart 0 f the
matter . Ramosa wants to capture the
geometry of the feelings, to make some-
thing solid, massive, and enduring of
fleeting emotions like joy, or transient
ecstasy and ephemeral euphoria.
It is not for a joke, then, that he
calls five pieces, Toy for Leonardo, and
one New Line of Joy; blocks and wheel-
like discs might look like the basis of
mere toys, but he wants to make some-
thing formidable of the emotions asso-
ciated with toys. Toy for Leonardo IB
(sft. high, $750) is formed from two
thick wooden discs that cut through
each other at right-angles, and in doing
so divide a box in the centre into four
equally sized square boxes; it is painted
with a thick, smooth, shiny light yellow
enamel and either casts sharp shadows
on itself or softens whole areas into
misted yellow. The circles, swinging
around with a sense of eternal joy, stop
to savor the pleasure, as it were, when
they meet one another and the four
cubes seem treasure boxes to store the
abundance of happiness. Toy for
2A of matt crimson-red and
Toy for Leonardo 3A (each $300) of
matt turquoise so slice up a sphere
between the two discs at right-angles
that from some aspects the sphere
becomes an ovoid—a subtle ambiguity
that goes along with the notion of these
firml * formed S but so f t -surfaced works
as s / mbols of the integrate d passions,
In Teorama (Bft. high, $1040) the
firm forms have been spftially separated
to emphasise the integration: a pile of
sweetish green discs in diminishing size
has been cut in two; one half, with the
widest disc at the top, has been placed
in the middle of a wall, the other half,
cut into quarters, is placed in two
corners with the widest quadrants on
the floor. The centre piece thrusts down
with extraordinary power while the
side pieces dance upwards with easy
steps; the achievement is a combination
of emotional equilibrium with exact
geometrical balance,
On the other hand, Toy for Leonardo
3B (4ft. high, $625), in brilliant, glossy
crimson-red, with the usual two discs
cutting at right-angles and with small
discs, seeming about to flap against the
large discs and inserted at 45deg., must
be about the containment of sheer,
glorious rapture. But the most sue-

The folk-art touch in “Urra Pele!”
separates it from hard-edge austerity
By ELWYN LYNN
cessful work, Urra Pele! (Bft. high,
$1200) takes the greatest risks, as it is
sweetness epitomised. It consists of five
spheres of wood, each balanced on the
other, the top one slightly smaller than
the others. Except that each sphere is
sliced and a dark green wedge thrust
into the slice, Urra Pele! would re-
semble a fantastic Italian ice-cream, for
bands of sweetest yellow meet bands of
sweetest pale greens on the spheres, and
the centre sphere is baby-pink. Just
because the soft, powdery pastels con-
tradict the firm shapes, the severe,
repetitive outlines begin to melt like ice-
cream. Though, like some recent
sculpture in Czechoslovakia and Yugo-
slavia, this is a subtle and sophisticated
piece, it shares with such sculpture a
folk-art love of varied color and honest
bulkiness; it is the folk-art touch that
separates it from hard-edge austerity.
Talking of Yugoslavia, Canberra has
Yugoslavian Paul Mlakar, who arrived
in Australia in 1965 and was assistant
to the celebrated three-dimensional,
optical artist Agam in Paris from 1963
to 1965. Mlakar produces brilliantly
colored works of long triangular prisms
of wood that show different surfaces as
you move by; most are tantalisingly
vivacious and demand a wider audience,
just as, we hope, Urra Pele! might
obtain a permanent audience in
Australia.

UKRAINIANS WHO
REFUSE TO BE
SWALLOWED WHOLE
By PATRICK MORGAN
Internationalism or Russification? Ivan
Dzyuba. Edited by M. Davies.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $6.30.
The Chornovil Papers compiled by
Vyacheslav Chornovil. McGraw-Hill.
$6.25.
SOME OF THE strongest pressure on
the Kremlin to invade Czechoslovakia
came from a man little known in the
West: Pyotr Shelest, the Stalinist First
Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist
Party. He and his Moscow bosses feared
the effect of the Czech freedom on
Czechoslovakia’s eastern flank, the
Ukraine, where a growing nationalist
feeling has been evident during this
decade.
The Ukraine has its own language,
culture, and tradition; it is as big in
every way as the most important coun-
tries in Western Europe—yet it has
been reduced to a mere ad’ministrative-
geographical term by 50 years of Soviet
imperialist domination. This history of
forced Russification is given in great
detail in “Internationalism or Russifica-
tion?”
Ivan Dzyuba is one of a new type of
young Ukrainian intellectuals who is
resisting the suppression of his own
culture. In 1965 he addressed and sent
this book to Shelest, was arrested,
removed from his job, and subjected
to the customary vilification in the
Party Press. As he has incurable TB,
he has since been returned to his post.
Lenin wrote in favor of sovereignty
and autonomous development for the
nationalities, and strongly attacked the
Russian great-power chauvinism of the
Tsars. Stalin, however, completely
reversed Lenin’s policy in what Dzyuba
describes as “one of the greatest
tragedies of the Ukrainian people in its
entire history.” Ukrainians were forcibly
deported while Russians were Imported
into key administrative positions. The
Ukrainian language was scorned and
Russian became essential in educational
institutions; publications in Ukrainian
diminished. Dzyuba provides evidence
of frightening physical and cultural
extermination, and shows how the
Russian colonisers have actually identi-
fied their views with their Tsarist pre-
decessors.
Younger Ukrainian intellectuals are
now objecting to the continuation of
these policies under Khrushchev and his
successors. The regime accuses them of
being narrowly chauvinistic rather than
being good Communist “international-
ists.” Dzyuba replies that “their
(Russian) ‘internationalism’ is the ‘inter-
nationalism’ of the robber who has
seized the choice of morsels and does
not want to hand them back.” The
Ukrainian nationalist 'movement is “a
nation’s ‘self-defence’ in the face of a
clear prospect of disappearing from the
human family.”
What catalysed Dzyuba into action
was the sudden rounding-up of the
Ukraine-conscious intellectuals in late
1965. Hundreds were warned, and scores
were interrogated, secretly tried and
sentenced to years of hard labor in the
notorious Potma camp in the Mordovian
“Autonomous” Republic. (This is final
proof that their country isn’t independ-
ent, the Ukrainians claim: Ukrainians
sentenced by Ukrainian courts are
imprisoned in another Republic.) In
his book, Dzyuba says of the interroga-
tion methods used by the secret police
in these closed trials: “Anyone who has
anything to do with it could tell quite
a story. If necessary, a good-sized note-
book could be filled on this subject.”
Someone who did have something to
do with it was doing just this, and his
“good-sized notebook” has now been
published in the West—“ The Chornovil
Papers.”
Vyacheslav Chornovil is a 30-year-old
journalist who was asked to inform on
his colleagues while covering the secret
trials:
“I declared that I would not give
any evidence at a closed trial, because
I did not wish to participate in a
flagrant violation of Soviet law, and,
at the sa'me time, I presented flowers
from their friends to the people unlaw-
fully condemned. Then the prosecutor
jumped up and in a high-pitched voice
called me an enemy who had no right
to speak of socialist legality. Soldiers
were ordered to remove me from the
courtroom, and they performed their
offensive operation with such lightning
speed that I did not have enough time
to open my ’mouth.”
Chornovil got 18 months hard labor
for this, but he managed to smuggle
out, page by page, his “White Book”
on the Ukrainian trials, just as in
Russia Alix Ginsburg, who was also
jailed for his troubles, collected and
smuggled out the “White Book” on
the Daniel-Sinyavsky trial.
The Chornovil and Dzyuba books
complement each other. Chornovil
describes contemporary illegality, and
Dzyuba fills in its background and
history. Dzyuba’s book is an argument,
Chornovil’s is a testament.
The first half of “The Chornovil
Papers” contains the author’s petition
to Shelest and the State authorities. It
consists of sections, each of which
describes a step in the process under-
gone by the “criminal” from initial
discovery to final hard labor. Each
section begins by quoting the appro-
priate sections of the Constitution and
criminal code, and then gives evidence
of what has actually happened in
individual cases, which clearly and
flagrantly breaches the law. Chornovil’s
description of a closed trial (in itself
illegal) exposes the sham of “Socialist
legality”:
“A closed trial resembles the closed
cage of a boa constrictor who is given
a small rabbit for his breakfast; before
the rabbit is devoured he is allowed to
present before the hungry predator all
the arguments of his innocence.”
The second half of the book, entitled
“This Misfortune of Intellect,” com-
prises the documented case-histories of
20 imprisoned Ukrainian intellectuals.
They consist of short biographies,
trial transcripts, sentences, appeals,
petitions, letters from camp, and short
extracts from their work. A constantly
recurring theme in this section, is the
similarity between today’s unchecked
illegalities and those of the Stalin
terror of the 19305.
The most heroic figure, the only one
mentioned in both books, is older than
the others: Syvatoslav Karavansky,
now 48, to whom the last 60 pages of
Chornovil’s book are devoted. Origin-
ally sentenced to 25 years hard labor
in 1945, Karanyansky was amnestied
in 1960 after having served 16J years
in camps. Undeterred by this experi-
ence, he wrote petitions to the authori-
ties protesting against violations of the
nationalities law. In 1965 he was sud-
denly rearrested and returned, without
trial, to complete his sentence in. the
labor camps, from where he continues
to send out a stream of carefully
argued petitions and appeals; he
remains unbroken by the further pun-
ishments, such as solitary confinements,
which he is being subjected to inside
the camps for doing so.
The courage of such men, as Kara-
vansky gives some hope to Dzyuba’s
belief that “the Ukrainian nation will
not become an outcast of the human
race.” So, too, does the remarkable
fact that it is those brought up entirely
within the Communist system who are
most resistant to it. Chornovil asks:
“Who is put behind bars in Ukraine
today? The authorities are trying
mostly young people who grew up
BAMBOO GROVE
The small valley between tall hills
Is plumed with yellow-green cockades,
A rustling wetness on long springs
Of bending stems thick as my arm.
Tender the strength, articulate the grace
of dripping crest, inflexibly flexible,
Suspended waterfalls of leaf
That fan each other with jostling sighs.
Under that roof of waves
The leaning trunks, like weeds
Anchored in rocks and moss,
Stir in a secret undersea.
I shift like an ocean diver
From bole to bole, grasping
Their yielding confidence that does not
yield,
Their force that does not fight.
Clambering barefoot a slender pole
Segmented like a lissom telescope,
I sway with it, bow with it, drench
Its green shadow with my darker tears.

NOT ALL IN THE PAST
By SANDRA HALL
Wowsers. Keith Dunstan. Cassell,
Australia. $5.00.
“WOWSERS” WOULD BE a funnier
book if you could regard it in the spirit
of its art nouveau dust jacket—as a
fine collection of Victorian anecdotes
on which to look back a little patron-
isingly from a more enlightened age.
But the fact that one of its more
absurd stories six-o’clock-closing
saga is also one of its most recent,
takes some of the fun out of it some-
how. Keith Dunstan treats it all in a
gentle tone, thinking, quite rightly I
suppose, that the incidents he sets
down speak eloquently enough for
themselves without additional com-
ments from him. Yet he could have
speculated a little longer about the
forces that, in 1968, keep so many of
us from reading the books we want to
read and from seeing the plays and
films we want to see, even though we
live in a nation, with none of the
religious intensity of Ireland or the
political conflicts of the USSR. It’s
only recently that we’ve begun gradu-
ally to end the traditional Sunday
silence, while government attitudes to
prostitution are still as befuddled and
head-in-the-sand as they’ve always
been..
In his introduction, Dunstan says he
has not deliberately set out to attack
wowserism, but “if there is any malice,
it comes out when wowsers turned
political, for in trying to mould every-
one in their own image, often they
created evils greater than those they
were trying to cure.” He might have
added a word about violence, too, for
the threat of the horsewhip was one
the wowser was fon,d of invoking, while
the ferocity of the police raids against
“sly grog” dealers on the goldfields in
the 1850 s turned self - righteousness
into unhealthy farce.
Yet, however intrinsically unattrac-
tive wowsers are, Dunstan has found
some colorful thunderers among them
like the Rev. John Alexander
Dowie, who waged a vigorous campaign
against the theatre, taking in every-
thing from Greek drama to “Uncle

1876. After it had been pointed out
by the Opposition that Sunday news-
papers did not involve sabbath labor,
the Government was left with the
argument that the cries of newsboys
would annoy churchgoers. And on
that, the Bill was passed.
But if it’s true that people get the
politicians they deserve,, they also get
the laws they deserve, an undeniable
fact about the introduction of six-
o’clock closing here. Dunstan recalls
that shorter hotel trading hours were
established because of an excess of
fervent but illogically expressed patriot-
ism in 1915, sparked by King George
V’s example in banning liquor from the
royal household for the duration of the
war, and fanned by accusations that
anyone who voted against six-o’clock
closing did so because of “selfish palates,
greedy pockets, and unpatriotic inter-
ests.” And in a referendum in New
South Wales in 1947, the six-o’clock
campaigners won again, despite the
generally admitted absurdity of the “six-
o’clock swill.”
Even when ten-o’clock closing came
to N.S.W. in 1955, it was by a small
margin—902,532 to 892,740. What could
have prompted a State full of the
world’s most enthusiastic beer-drinkers
to impose this unnatural reign of self-
denial on itself —just a general antipathy
toward change of any kind or a vague
fear of some sort of violent spirit in
itself which might suddenly wake if
allowed a drop after the magic hour
of six?
Dunstan records the reactions against
the excesses of the young colony and the
power of the Non-Conformist churches
in the last decades of the 19th century,
but it’s hard to understand the dura-
bility of such influences.
Naturally enough, his research is con-
centrated on Victoria, where he has
mined the richest store of wowserisms,
and the chapter which points up Mel-
bourne’s individuality in this regard is
the one about the early days of public
bathing. By 1911, Sydneysiders were
already dedicated surfers, but Melburn-
ians were still inhibited by beaches
divided into separate sections for men
and women, and laws forbidding swim-
ming after 10 a.m. each day.
The “Argus” railed heartily against
these restrictions, but, rather curiously,
took a different stand on the 'matter of
sunbathing. Anticipating all those
modern commentators who’ve written
about the significance of sunbathing as
our national pastime, and about the
cult of the tan, the “Argus” deplored it
because it encouraged idleness.
Its devotees were almost fanatics,
neglecting their responsibilities “in their
blind enthusiasms for the sun . . . With
such people, indeed, the gradual brown-
ing of the skin under the sun’s rays
appears to constitute half the fascina-
tion.”
Dunstan has been assiduous in his
search for the off-beat, and many of the
anecdotes he’s chosen have an - irony
which makes the book fine entertain-
ment. One story to be classified as rare
is the fact that the N.S.W. branch of
the RSL once defended a book banned
as obscene. Admittedly, it was Lawson
Glassop’s novel about the men of
Tobruk, “We Were the Rats,” but at
least it’s a start.

Selected Poems 1942-1968. David
Campbell. Angus & Robertson. $3.75.
THE ONLY disappointing thing about
this volume is that there is not enough
of it. One would have preferred a
“collected” to a “selected.” A number
of poems have been omitted, including
the very haunting ballad “Hogan’s
Daughter.” It is perhaps an indication
of David Campbell’s modesty and
high standards that he should have
pared his poetry down to 128 pages.
A few details about Campbell’s
background may explain the difference
between his poetry and the type of
poetry current in the British and
American scen.e. Born in 1915, Camp-
bell was educated at King’s School,
Parramatta, and then at Cambridge,
and played international football for

Eyes smarting, wildly dancing

Campbell...with a Scots edge
England. As a pilot in the RAAF he
was awarded the DFC and bar, and
now farms a property near
Bungendore.
He is heir to the warrior-farmer-bard
tradition, a tradition unfortunately
becoming rarer as more poets are
speaking from academic podiums or
doing paperwork to earn themselves a
crust. It is not possible to turn the
clock back to the psalms of David, and
it is obviously unhistorical to imagine
that most of the major poets in the
past were men of action. However,
when a David Campbell can be a
David Campbell he deserves a cheer.
Another irrelevancy (perhaps).
Watching the film “Culloden” a couple
of years ago and the tall, blond Scots
who took part in the film, I was
reminded very much of how very
Scottish David Campbell is in appear-
ance, tall, golden and very dashing.
With such an appearance he could get
away with writing vast, loose Nietz-
schean hymns to the sun. In fact his
poetry is modest, ironic an.d gently
romantic. It has a Scots edge.
His work includes frankly hedonistic
love poems, finely polished poems about
the cold Monaro country where he
lives, war poems; these are some of his
themes. In “Winter Stock Route” he
writes:
But where my skis trace
Their transient snow furrow,
For generations both
Man and beast will follow.
Now in this winter passage
I cross the deserted stage.
“Windy Nights” shows him in his
ironic mood.
O what do lovers love the best,
Upstairs naked or downstairs dressed?
Windy nights and hot desire
Or an old book and a steady fire?
Ask your mistress. Should she pause,
She has a lover out of doors.
David Campbell is a minor poet in
the very best sense of the word, and in
the way in which, say, De la Mare is a
minor poet. Many minor poets achieve
far more in the way of poetry than a
lot of would-be major poets ever get
near. Campbell is concerned with
pleasing his reader and providing enjoy-
ment, a meal for the mind and the
senses. At the same time he is not a
banal optimist.
There is a hardness under the decep-
tively light surface, rock beneath the
snowdrift. In fact, David Campbell’s
art is a very difficult and demanding
art. It is not easy to write in the
simple short rhyming lines he uses.
Longer lines and more complex
language can disguise lapses. In the
type of poetry which Campbell writes
the lapses stick out like an undone
bishop’s garter.
Sometimes the poems do come out
with a technical burr here and there
in the fleece. In his first book, “Speak
with the Sun,” there is also an occa-
sional brashness and topicality which
jars. However, these faults decrease in
his later work.
There seems to be a point at which
Australian poetry branches off from
English poetry and follows a line of its
own,. Australian poetry has tended to
be a development and consolidation of
the Georgian tradition (in the way in
which Frost develops and deepens it).
Modern British and American poets
have, however, reacted against the
Georgians. While our country has not
produced anyone as major as Frost, we
have produced a great wealth of minor
poets, some of whom one hesitates to
call “minor.”
David Campbell stands well within
this Australian Georgian mainstream,
In poems such as “The End of
Exploring,” “Winter Stock Route,”
and “Night Sowing,” he has produced
some of the finest lyrics written in
this country. In “The Miracle at
Mullion Hill” and “The Australian
Dream,” which is his very celebrated
poem about putting up the royal
family for the night, he has shown the
ability to produce poetry of a high
order which is also extremely funny.

“Biff Mark,” as Tasmania called him,
was one of those criminals who for
one reason or another win a kind of
wry affection from the general public.
He was, as the sub-title claims, a
burglar, but not a great one.
Jeffrey’s burglarious career in Eng-
land was comparatively brief and really
quite unnecessary no starving city
worker or downtrodden rural laborer
was Big Mark, but a young man who,
with his brother Luke had built up a
respectable Cheap Jack business-
they were travelling pedlars whose
takings were high income for those
times Mark was a good boxer who
could usually win a purse or find
employment as a navvy or as a skilled
and experienced farmhand.
The Jeffrey lads had respectable
brothers and sisters. Mark and Luke
ran away from home in 1840, when
Mark was sixteen and Luke three years
younger. Home had been pleasant,
prosperous, cind comfortable until their
father, a gardener, who had saved and
who owned two houses, took to drink
and to beating his wife and children.
As the old broadside ballads warned,
“gay roving blades” despite ‘parents
who reared me tenderly” too often
drifted into “bad company ’ and met
their “downfall.” Mark and Luke were
no exception. Drink, gambling, and
“pretty and fascinating” women lured
the money from their pockets. They
made close friends of two brothers, John
and Thomas Hart, hawkers of brooms
and ornaments, who were also thieves.
At first Jeffrey resisted the tempta-
tion the Hart brothers offered, but
eventually he and Luke joined in the
robberies, with Mark inventing fancy
touches like the disguise of “a ghostly
costume ... as I imagined that it would
have the effect of striking additional
terror to the hearts of those with whom
we came in contact during our
expeditions.”
Big Mark was 6ft. 4in. tall, vigorous,
and perpetually hungry. His own
account (which prison and other records
confir'm) displays his constant preoccu-
pation with food. Prison rations were
short enough, but so corruptly allotted
that some convicts literally starved.
From the earliest days of his imprison-
ment the pattern of Jeffrey’s life
emerged: hunger, violence, punishment,
hunger, violence. “One day, when more
than usually hungry and exasperated, I
seized an additional piece of bread from
the turnkey as he was serving out the
allowance. ‘You have one piece,’ said
he. This was provocation enough for me
in the condition I then was, and I
immediately retaliated by knocking him
down. For this act I was sentenced to
three days’ solitary confine’ment.”
Transported for 15 years, Jeffrey dis-
embarked at Hobart in 1850 and was
sent to Norfolk Island. At first it seems
as if Jeffrey were going to make good
fairly quickly, but his violence got the
better of him: “I will admit, however,
that many of the miseries I suffered
were the fruits of my own passionate
temper and stubborn nature.” Mean-
while, Luke and Tom Hart, who were
transported to Western Australia, were
model prisoners who each received his
ticket of leave in 1851. No doubt they
were saner men than poor Big Mark,
who grew to fear his own lack of
restraint. At Norfolk Island, in Hobart,
Launceston, and in Port Arthur and
other prisons his record is consistent. He
was feared, but seldom hated. Many
officials, a clergyman, surgeons, and
jailers went out of their way in attempt-
ing to help and reform him.
By middle life, although by then the
conditions of the Penal System were
greatly improved and far more humane,
Jeffrey’s troubles were compounded by
dreadfully ulcerated legs, possibly a
consequence of wearing leg-irons so
often. He walked with the aid of heavy
sticks and used them as weapons even
at a time when, as one ex-warder
re'membered, “all the vim had been
knocked out of him.”
Jeffrey was convicted of murder in
Tasmania. His fellow prisoners feared
him as much as his jailers did. Yet,
despite the frank revelations of his auto-
biography, perhaps because of his lack
of self-pity, he was by no means uni-
versally disliked in his time, and it is
impossible not to like him now in the
pages of this well-produced, well-edited,
and interesting book.


THE LAND
Wanted: a prospectus
of rural demand
THE RECOVERY in wool prices
this year has put everybody in the
industry in a better mood including,
apparently, the economists at the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat, who’ve been
looking into the market prospects for
the staple as far ahead as 1980 and
come up with the suggestion that Aus-
tralia will be able to sell all the wool
it produces at that time. Unfortunately
the report is a secret one not yet even
circulating within the IWS and may
never see the public light of day. This
is a pity because, on the face of it,
such a finding could be read as giving
the green light for expansion of wool
production here. On the other hand,
considering the serious profit margin
squeeze which has dogged the industry
in recent years, it cannot be read in
isolation. To get a more balanced view,
at the very least the report would have
to say how prices will look in 1980 and
in the intervening years, what qualities
and types will be in best demand, and
so on. Maybe it does this, but will we
ever know? And even more, it would
remain for the Australian industry to
inquire very deeply into the likely
trend in, their costs before embarking
on expansion.
If the Government were to contem-
plate expansion on the basis of the IWS
finding, it would have to take a much
closer look than it has so far at the
role it expects the wool industry to
play in the overall economy and as a
contributor to overseas exchange. As
with the rest of rural industry, wool
has been left in the dark on these im-
portant fronts, the more so since the
spotlight turned on minerals as the
coming star on the exports stage.
At a time when the wool industry
is seeing itself more than ever as a
marginally profitable one and many-
small growers, especially, are barely-
making ends meet, it is rather a pity
that only bits of the IWS report have
been leaked. It is tantalising to dangle
the carrot of assured future sales up to
1980 in front of them without reference
to the price and cost pitfalls on the
path ahead. In any case, a report on
demand prospects in isolation can be
very misleading, especially when de-
mand is construed in a world context.
In face of the costs-prices squeeze, a
lot of woolgrowers have been turning
away from sheep to other things in
recent years, some even getting out of
farming altogether - operating, as it
were, a voluntary restriction scheme
which could, in itself, help to prevent an
oversupply of wool to world markets.
A broad generalisation that demand is
going to be all right, many years ahead,
is net going to reverse this process.
Wool is not alone among rural in-
dustries looking for assurances on future
demand prospects but, willynilly, most
of the others (covering a variety of
products including wheat, fruit, vege-
tables, cotton, tobacco, dairying, and
even meat) are still expanding in spite
of this. In some of them, notably dairy-
ing and fruit, dark clouds hang over
future demand prospects and they’re the
sort of clouds that are not going to blow
lightly away, say, should we get a
more competitive dollar in the event
of foreign governments removing “tem-
porary” import restrictions as in the
case of beef in the U.S. In some of
these particular rural industries, there’s
a good case to be made for restricting
output and, certainly, to hold up ex-
pansion until the future demand pros-
pects are clarified. While in some of
them restriction is being forced by the
costs-prices squeeze, in others, like
wheat, the effects of this squeeze have
largely been negatived by stabilisation
arrangements which encourage growers
to make up on the quantity swings what
is lost on the world-prices roundabouts.
Levels of output in particular rural
products are at present entirely a matter
for the industries concerned (and the
seasons, of course). True market pros-
pects play some part in the decisions,
but there’s an urgent need for them to
be guided by the sort of future demand
prospectus drawn up by the IWS for
wool, even if it has to be admitted that
to be of any use for practical purposes
these would have to project the pros-
pects a lot closer than 1980. One has
not heard of anything of this kind
being made available to the various
rural industries, say by the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics or the Aus-
tralian Agricultural Council, who could
try their hand at them. In the event,
the main thought of most of these
industries facing uncertain export
markets and low prices is to go for
higher outputs as a way out of their
costs dilemmas.
Over the long term, the true arbiter
of the level of production should be
the balance of profitability, realistically
determined. To get this it is necessary
to throw in the full measure of Gov-
ernment assistance, including the
elements arising from Government
guarantees for home market consump-
tion. In Australia this makes the
‘'balance of profitability” an artificial
concept, as it does in most countries
where agriculture is highly protected.
The Government does, in fact, deter-
mine in co-operation with the indus-
ries the degree of artificiality, but this
doesn’t relate all that closely to the
Government’s own value judgment of
the usefulness of the particular industry
to the economy, mainly because of his-
torical factors entering into it. Latterly,
however, the Government has become
more exacting on this score, as witness
its removal of the old cost of produc-
tion formula from the new Wheat
Stabilisation Agreement.
As a matter of fact, the Govern-
ment has the ball at its feet even more
surely than its recent actions might sug-
gest. If it came to the point of want-
ing to restrict wheat acreage in Aus-
tralia over the heads of the States,
whom it might find awkward to get
to agree, it is suggested by F. R.
Gruen, Professor of Agricultural
Economies at Monash University, that
the simplest \yay to do it would be
to announce early in the year (say by
March) that the first advance to wheat-
growers on the next crop would be
reduced, say, to 75 cents a bushel, with
a two to three years’ wait for the
remaining payments.
AGRISEARCH
TAPPING NEW GENES
WE HAVE heard some discussion
recently about the desirability of estab-
lishing a $9 million maximum-security
laboratory for the study of exotic virus
diseases of livestock. It has been
claimed that such a facility could
increase our efficiency in stamping out
a new disease should an outbreak occur.
This subjunctive argument is not likely
to impress livestock producers over-
whelmed by the continuing cost-price
squeeze. They are more likely to be
attracted by schemes that promise
prompt and positive alleviation, such as
improvement of the inherent produc-
tivity of their animals. Thus, their
more pressing need is for a maximum-
security quarantine station through
which new ovine, bovine, and porcine
genes can be safely introduced. Unfor-
tunately, the scientists are not canvass-

ing this proposition so keenly, although
it would cost far less and soon result
in adding millions of dollars to the
annual value of production from these
industries. Farmers and stud breeders
themselves should lobby for a system
which will permit them to tap the
genetic material available in at least
the cleaner parts of the world. Later,
perhaps, when we are completely satis-
fied with the safety of the procedures,
we could make the whole world our
hunting ground, not only for the
uniquely valuable genes, but also for
those that would simply add variety.
These might often provide a source of
hybrid vigor when crossed with our old
blood lines.
To raise the growth rate of a herd of
beef cattle by an average of half a
pound per head per day would prob-
ably take about 20 years where the
breeder can only select within the
existing population. Through the intro-
duction of new animals already possess-
ing this degree of superiority, the goal
for the herd would be achieved in about
a third of the time. By all accounts the
Charolais has at least this much advan-
tage over our cattle, and in Britain, the
U.S.A., and elsewhere is setting the
standard in beef growth rates, feed effi-
ciency, and carcass quality. At the
U.S. National Beef Show this year, for
instance, Charolais or Charolais-cross
carried off ten of the top 12 awards.
This show, incidentally, is judged on
realistic criteria. Appearance on the
hoof is scarcely considered. Almost all
the points are won or lost after
slaughter, when various measures are
applied to the carcass. The grand
champion carcass of the show came
from an Angus-Charolais steer which
weighed 10751 b. alive and yielded a
6881 b. carcass after having gained at
the rate of 1.61 b. dressed weight per
day of age. It had a 13.8 square-inch
eye muscle with only 0.3 inch fat
covering.
Other frustrating examples of the
effect of our current quarantine
arrangements are the Finnish Landrace
sheep and the Danish Landrace pigs.
The prolificacy of these breeds could
probably never be equalled by selec-
tion among the blood lines presently
available here. In dairy cattle the
American Holstein is years ahead of
our best. We have an infant sheep-
milk cheese industry, but the yield of
the sheep being used for it cannot be
compared with that of the East Friesian
milk sheep. The breeds mentioned are
just a few of those with outstanding
advantages that all come from countries
with very high standards of animal
health. Ceylon boasts a breed of swine
that has 32 teats, with which it com-
monly raises litters of 25. The intro-
duction of more African and Asian
cattle would no doubt speed the de-
velopment of strains better adapted to
our expanding northern beef industry,
but we would need to hasten slowly in
bringing in genes from such disease-
ridden areas and only do so after
experience with the introduction of
European and American stock.


Cellar notes
from
Lindeman’s
When selecting gifts for friends and
relatives at Christmas have you ever
considered wine? With the ever-
increasing awareness and appreciation
of table wine in this country, a bottle
or two of suitable Dry White or Dry
Red makes an ideal present. More and
more people and companies are taking
note of this trend, and suddenly finding
the solution to their gift problems.
Lindemans reputation for quality
makes their products the obvious choice,
and eliminates any doubt as to whether
the bottle or bottles will be appreciated
by the recipient.
We suggest that with quality wine it
is not particularly important to know
the exact preferences of the recipient,
and that the donor can rest content in
the knowledge that his or her tastes are
beyond question.
Broadly, table wines fall into five
groups, viz. Dry Red table wines
(Claret and Burgundy), Dry White
table wines (Riesling, Hock, Chablis,
and White Burgundy), Fruity White
table wine (Moselles), Sweet White
table wines (Sauternes), and Sparkling
Wines (Champagne, Sparkling Moselle,
Sparkling Burgundy, etc.).

almost 30 years of Tullochs wines.
And what a row. Brother Bill
Dunstan had attended a like tasting of
Tahbilk wines, and having been a
devotee of Tullochs for some time, and
having collected numerous vintages of
theirs, thought wouldn’t it be a good
idea? Wouldn’t it, indeed? So Johnny
Walker helped with other bottles and
Max Lake and I contributed a couple
of ancient heirlooms and there we were.
I only hope the book lasts and retains
its flavor as long as some of the wines.
To start at the wrong end, the older
wines were quite superb. The 1929
bottled by Caldwells had an incredible
flavor, a mixture of Hunter and Beaune,
a light yet intense and complex series
of taste sensation. The ’32 I would
pick as French any day. This showed
magnificent wood; one can only assume
the cask was new however big it was,
for these were days before small oak
maturation in this country. This oak
character had so mingled with the fruit
flavors to make a noble union that one
could only be amazed at the wine. I
haven’t seen anything like it from Aus-
tralia before. Pity you can’t go and
buy five dozen just down the road.
By comparison, the 1931 was just an
old Hunter. No French character, no
depths of unexpected complexity. It
tasted bloody marvellous, as a magni-
ficent old Hunter in top condition
should, and that was about all there
was to it—which is quite enough for
me. It indicates that if you do get a
top Hunter of a good year and keep it
for years and years you get your
reward. Those of you who have, for
example, the Drayton 650, the Tyrrell
Vat 9 of ’66 and Vat 85 of ’67, and
the McWilliams Mount Pleasant Phillip
of ’65 and ’66 will have your day some
years hence.
These were incredible old wines.
Although not as good, the two examples
of ’45 were, as you would expect, in
some sort of good order. Both seemed
to contain pressings, though this could
have been due to the big year that ’45
was. But one was porty and had a very
strong tarry quality. The other was
much better, softer, and more delicate,
though the big, tarry sort of flavor was
still there.
Fro’m 1952 on there was some sort of
continuity. These definitive tastings
prove again and again that one must be
guarded about cellaring wines. Some
improve marvellously and some not at
all. Though there was a strong thread
of character through the various vin-
tages, not all have repaid the care and
attention they have received. I have
tasted better ’s2s. The ’54 was a stan-
dard line, pleasant, developed, of good
character without being anything
special. Later I tried the famous
Private Bin Pokolbin Dry Red. This
was as magnificent as ever, a fan-
tastic old red, still big and firm, but
with a tremendous flavor and nose. A
great old Australian wine that will still
go for years arid years. The ’55, not
considered a great year, was surprisingly
good. Well balanced and soft, with a
lesser degree of the tarry-flavor style
that the bigger wines have. This lighter
degree of flavor is sometimes referred
to as a “sweaty saddle.” “Tarry,”
“sweaty saddle.” We shall have to do
something about wine words.
Of the next four vintages the ’59 was
best. The ’56 was slightly unbalanced
and rather hard. The ’57 I liked for
flavor and bouquet, but this wine was
also marred by a hard finish. The ’5B
seemed to be fading a bit and the fruit
was not evident enough through the
wine. The ’59 was one of the best wines
there, round and soft with plenty of
flavor and style and a clean, smooth,
lingering finish. The bad years of ’6O,
’6l, and ’62 were reflected in the.wines.
They were not bad wines exactly, but
all lacked complexity and character.
There was just not enough to them.
The ’63 was better, being light but
having pronounced Hunter Valley
flavor. I didn’t think this would last
for many more years. The ’64 was
very good, light, balanced, intense. This
wine will go for years and will build
up flavor and bouquet. The ’65 Private
Bin counterpart was almost as good, a
bigger wine without quite the finesse
of the ’64. The ’66 has everything, a
good young wine, very full bodied with
big fruit flavors, round and soft in spite
of its youth. This is another keeper
and is the one currently on the shelves
—Tullochs Pokolbin Dry Red Private
Bin, 1966. Buy it and forget it. The
Hunter character will dominate after
two or three more years and will give
the wine real style and quality. The
’67, though lighter, has also plenty of
quality and the Hunter flavor is already
apparent.
Another wine of interest was the ’65
bottling of the Glen Elgin Home
Paddock wine, a big, full-bodied,
complex-flavored style that will live for
30 years and needs half that to be
drinkable. I also looked at the two ’67
straight bottlings, one from Fordwich
and one from Glen Elgin. These wines
both took Golds in Melbourne last
year in the young Burgundy class. They
will be sold as straight Pokolbin Private
Bin Dry Reds.
Tullochs have a special place in the
hearts of so many of us, and I was
delighted to attend this comprehensive
tasting of their wines, especially when it
coincided with my mate’s whopping
book on Wowsers. It’s a strange life,
and I wouldn’t be missing it for quids.

Abortion law
To clarify a point in “The Blind Eye”
(8., November 30), “Abortion Law
Reform?” by John Bennett, is published
by the Victorian Council for Civil
Liberties, but was given to N.S.W. State
Members of Parliament by the Abortion
Law Reform Association.
Some reasons for advocating reform
are: that a law which cannot be
enforced is by definition a bad law, e.g.,
probably one-quarter of married women
have had an abortion and are “liable
to penal servitude for five years.” A law
which, if enforced, would disrupt family
life and the national econo’my is so
stupid it weakens respect for law in
general. That, in family planning, con-
traception is the method of choice, but
abortion is a necessary back-stop.
Termination of pregnancy in the first
12 weeks is simple and safe (statistically
four times safer than childbirth in
countries where the operation is legal).
That we carinot force a mother to want
her child even though we force her to
bear it. A Swedish social study of chil-
dren born after their mothers had been
refused abortion found a significantly
higher-than-average record of psychi-
atric illness and anti-social behaviour.
The UN Secretary-General, speaking
on Human Rights Day, said: “The size
of a family must be based on the
decisions of responsible parents con-
cerned with the dignity and well-being
of their children.”

I must decline the status of being “one
of Australia’s leading experts on abor-
tion,” kindly conferred on ‘me (8.,
November 30).
There cannot be any “experts” on
morality, hence none on the moral
aspects of abortion. On the technical
and scientific aspects, the evidence is
very spotty, and top men of goodwill
are deeply divided. I doubt whether
abortion is a subject for which the
notion of expertise is appropriate.
As to my own work, it is compara-
tive, not just confined to Australia.
You report that some say I’m “sitting
on the fence.” If this means that I’m
trying to be analytical, I plead guilty.

The franc
“President de Gaulle, by refusing to
devalue the franc,” says your “Inter-
national” columnist (8., November 30),
“seems determined to bring the world
monetary system crashing down.”
But President Johnson and his finan-
cial adviser, Mr. Fowler, praised Presi-
dent de Gaulle unstintingly for not
devaluing the franc. Perhaps, however,
they were kidding. They really wanted
“to bring the world monetary system
crashing down.”
The funny thing is, though, that on
page 17 of the same issue of The
Bulletin another contributor wrote that
if the French franc was devalued the
U.S.A. dollar might have to follow suit,
and that if the franc and sterling went
down the indications are that the Aus-
tralian dollar would be devalued, too.
This, no doubt, is what your “Inter-
national” columnist would then describe
as stabilising the world monetary
system!

The article “The Single Life” (8.,

the many thousands of lonely, mentally
disturbed, troubled single people about

"May"
In “One More Week” (8., November
30) Miss Rolfe is right to say that it
is hard for anyone to understand what
SUDS was in its heyday under Miss
May Hollinworth. It is very hard for
me, at least, because I have never
heard of Miss Hollinworth.
It is also hard for me to understand
the suggestion that drama presentation
at the university is moribund. It is
easy to realise how the ladies and
gentlemen of the Press have formed
this view, since my Society wastes
upward of a dozen complimentary
tickets for the best seats in the house
on the Press for each of its productions.
No one ever comes: but then to say
that the drama is moribund at the
university must be rather ostrich-like.
I should say that it would have been
possible this year to go weekly and see
a production of a different play. I
should also say that the productions
are of the best amateur standard. I
would also point out that our produc-
tion in 1968, although it had a cast of
ten, involved well over a hundred
people, most of whom would never
have any other contact with the
theatre.
There is also great variety in the
productions—they are not all “student-
type” plays Graduate Theatre did
Bernard Shaw, the Women’s College
did Congreve, we did “Charley’s Aunt,”
and St. Paul’s College did Joe Orton.
For all these reasons, I for one find it
very hard to see how drama in the
university can be called moribund.
