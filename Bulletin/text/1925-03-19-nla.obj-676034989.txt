A Children’s Library
In a very drab part of London there is
an ugly little house announcing itself as
“David Copperfield’s Library.” There
Dickens lived as a boy; and by a very happy
thought the place is now, for book-
starved urchins of Somerstown, a treasure-
trove such as Dickens himself as a boy
must many a time have dreamed in vain of
finding. We were in this little old house
cue day, loving the idea behind its conversion
and yet thinking of the thousand and one
ways in which it could be made really beau-
tiful, when the thought struck us: Why not
have a Children’s Library in Surry Hills,
Sydney? Underground railway posters would
make an excellent wall-decoration for the
main reading-room, so forthwith underground
posters were acquired. Thus far did the
idea develop in 1922. The winter of 1923
saw much making of cushions, big floor
cushions and tiny things for the little chairs
which we were to have some day, of aprons,
quaint ones in all manner of colors and
styles, for the children whose thronging to
this dream-library was never for one moment
in question. For years Elsie Rivett had run
a kindergarten on Sunday afternoons and a
small club during the week in Surry Hills,
and we knew the big need of hundreds of
girls and boys for just some such thing as
we hoped might grow out of our library idea.
And as the promise of this growing seemed
somehow so certain we sent off for an initial
£4O worth of books, the nucleus of a collec-
tion—and a very charming one it is—that
now numbers about 700 volumes. Happily
there arrived most opportunely a lovely
bundle of grass mats from the islands; and
what more is needed for a Children’s Library
besides books, and floor-mats, and cushions,
and charming aprons, but a building?
And here the Society of Friends proved the
good fairy, for very generously it put at our
disposal the large basement room of its
meeting-house, at 119 Devonshire-street,
with no attached charges save that of care-
taker’s remuneration. The decoration of the
room began forthwith with the children’s
friezes, and our posters (since increased in
number by the welcome gifts of other col-
lectors). Some charming reproductions of
Viennese children’s work have been added,
several little water-color panels kindly done
for the library, two Cecil Aldin prints, and
rather an attractive set of Robinson Crusoe
pictures. A number of small chairs and
tables were lent to us by the Devonshire-
street _ Kindergarten committee, and the
majority of these we later on bought at a
low figure. The floor we had stained a
warm brown; and the library to-day is a
bright, colorful spot in drab Surry Hills.
Brown bookshelves with their shining rows
of books, the low chairs and tables scattered
about, the floor cushions, the cool grass mats,
big, bright bowls always filled with flowers,
which each day the children take home, two
tiny “bathrooms” on either side of the door,
with the aprons hung over low screens, alto-
gether make a very sweet picture. The
Kindergarten committee has most kindly lent
us its piano for a while, and we have a
gramophone with a record cupboard which
is not too full yet!
The library was started on February 26
of last year, and since then it has been open,
except for a Christmas spell, on three after-
noons and two evenings each week. To begin
with it was purely a reading library, but
now the older girls and boys take books
home. During the afternoons the children
either read to themselves or are read to or
told stories individually or in groups. To
the number of people who will come so to
read or tell stories we should welcome big
additions. In the evenings from 7 to 8.30
o’clock are clubs for children over nine years
of age, with a tiny club on Thursdays
from half past six to seven o’clock for the
smaller ones. Tuesday’s club is for the
girls, Thursday’s for the boys. Some children
prefer to read and a few to play games
during the evening, but for the majority
crafts” are the attraction.
Each club numbers about 50 children in
regular attendance, except that of the tiny
children in their weekly half-hour of rhythmic
games, which is a smaller affair. On Sun-
day afternoon all the children have songs,
and there is expression work, in wax, with
chalks, paper-tearing and so on, in connection
with stories told. In December we had a
little exhibition of the work the children had
done during the year. Really, the library
with its associated club activities (and these
somehow proved the natural adjunct of the
library) has started well. But though a
fine baby, it must grow, and grow, and grow
And as there is no dearth of children it is
people to help of whom primarily we stand,
in need. From 60 to 80 children come to
the library each afternoon, about 200 alto-
gether being connected. And many more
need only to know what is being done to
swell the numbers in attendance very con-
siderably. _ One thing of which we want much
for the children is music; so even if regular
coming to the library ivere impossible, any-
one who should drop in just occasionally to
play or sing for half an hour would be
most welcome.
For the children fully to get what the
library has to give ever so many people are
needed to help them in their reading; to take
the wee ones into picture-book and nurserv
rhyme and fairy-tale land, to open to the
older ones the magic gateways to the wonder
of history, of travel, of nature knowledge,
of myth and legend, of fiction, of poetry, of
play. Witt! enough people to help marvel-
iw 3 i^ 1 ? 88 - c ? n be (Jone : ha PPy Play-acting
lot histoncai scene or imaginative tale),
with the assistance of a really exciting pro-
perty box: the making of miniature stages
and scenarios; little by little the writing of
poem, story and play by the children them-
selves, and their appropriate illustrating,
vor once the imagination is really fired
creation must * follow, and does. These
and a thousand other happy plays could
spring go sweetly and easily from the child-
ren s minds in the setting that already is
prepared if only the magicians to call them
lorth would come in sufficient numbers. Some
magicians we already have, several of them
trained kindergarteners, and almost all
people who lead very full and busy lives
apart from the time so generously and
happily given to the library. ' Anyone who
can bring anything of joy or beauty will
indeed be welcomed.
So far about £250 has been spent in con-
nection with the library, mainly in the pur-
chase of books and craft materials (all help
is, of course, voluntary). Of that amount
we have received £195, largely in small sub-
scriptions. If an assured income were pos-
sible we could expand mightily; and we have
thought that perhaps many people, unable
to help in other ways, would be glad to give
an annual subscription of a guinea, or half a
guinea, or less or more as might prove indi-
vidually possible. Should 200 friends do this
we could immediately clear off our deficit,
have the necessary funds in hand for the
big outlay which the re-commencement of the
clubs this year will mean within the next
week or so, and for the future we could be
sure of enough money to meet the constant
expenditure necessary for the upkeep and
expansion of the library and of all its attend-
ant activities. If any are able and should
care to help the Children’s Library in any
way at all, by activity or by gift, we
should appreciate their kindness. And
should any care to visit it they will be very
welcome on any Tuesday, Thursday or Sun-
day afternoon, or on any Tuesday or Thurs-
day evening.

Criticism and the Feminine
To be a true critic it is necessary
to be impersonal. In this connection it is
frequently said that the critical attitude
involves a divorcement of pleasure from
experience; but such a view implies both an
exaggeration of the joys of egoism and
narrow interpretation of the functions o::
criticism. Some emotional absorption is ce
tainly lost, since a measure of detachment s
essential to any analysis, but a greater, mor
lasting intellectual pleasure is surely gainec.
To feel that we like a person or thing un
reservedly is forcible but transient. T
require reasons for that liking makes i;
ours always; for not only does the labo
of expression leave it indelibly impressec
upon our minds, but avenues are opened u
revealing gardens of richer, rarer beauty a
W'e search. Oddly enough man must forge
himself before he may find himself. Biolog
cally speaking, justice is the last evolve
of human characteristics, and no one ca
be just who is not first impersonal, and n
one can administer justice who is not cap
able of effective criticism.
A sense of /humor is usually allied t
analytical impersonality also, and indicate
an abiding recognition of incongruity exist
mg between personal pretensions or action
and the ideal or infinite. It is in these cor
related and impersonal attributes of justice
humor and capacity for criticism that woman
as compared with man is lacking, and this
fact throws some irradiation on the other
wise (to the male mind) inexplicable con
struction of the popular novel. Living
largely on her emotions (suitably sacchari
fied) and her intuitions (which mainly
means her guesses), woman is usually in
capable of reflective introspection. She criti-
cises, yes, but it is a parasitic or reflex criti-
cism of appearances and externals. As
critic of dress, decorum and ceremony, man
lags far behind his bitter-half. She prac-
tises idolatry, but has no ideals, seeks to
act her part rather than live it, and silences
her soul with sentimental narcotics. She
enthusiastically embraces the psycho-
analysis craze, not because she desires to
look herself squarely in the face (that is
the last thing she wishes to do) ; but, being
a sex specialist, any creed that seeks to
interpretate life almost solely in terms of
sex cannot fail to have her approval. She
has all the primitive awe and love for cere-
mony and ritual, and takes a barbaric pride
m personal adornment, so the churches bene-
fit, and the adept tickler of feminine literary
palates writes accordingly.
Now, since the majority of readers are
feminine, the popular novel almost invari-
ably represents an extension and intensifica-
tion of feminine psychology. This dispro-
portion of female to male readers is fre-
quently deplored but is easily understand-
able. For one thing, woman’s occupations
have never been as absorbingly difficult and
interesting as man’s. There is the greater
drudgery, but her mental faculties are not
fully exercised. She, therefore, seeks in her
reading that romance and adventure which
man finds m his sport and work. Certainly
woman is learning now to do much of man’s
work, but this generalisation still holds good,
nevertheless. . Further, because woman is
mimetic of mind (which is why she excels
man m dramatic art and no other) rather
than critical or creative, she seeks for some-
thing to imitate. She finds this in an in-
tense state in her novels, strives to apply
it m her life, and often ends by blaming her
life partner (so-called) for his failure to live
up to the hero that existed only in the novel
that convinced her he should exist. Mean-
while she is blissfully unaware that she has
failed to reach the standard set by her hero-
ine. An intensely personal attitude to life
is almost inevitably accompanied by an abid-
ing belief in the invariability and definiteness
or human character. Einstein has proved
that time and space have no definitely sepa-
rate existence; only time-space is true. But
we do not need Einstein to tell us that there
is neither absolute hero nor villain, only a
hero-villain. But this will not suit my lady.
Virtue and vice are not to her interdepen-
dent and correlated as they are to the analy-
tical mind, but rather two definitely different
and warring forces. Which may partly
account for the sometimes astounding manner
in which she retains her sex purity.
The result of these things is that the novel-
ist who caters solely for circulation must
produce, not characters, but caricatures.
Lacking in a sense of humor or justice"
femininity demands intolerance towards her
book enemies and favoritism towards her
book friends, and she desires both to be

distinctly labelled. An author who preserved
a critical attitude towards his creations she
would not tolerate. She scans the Births,
Deaths and Marriages” first in her news-
paper, and insists upon a similar stressing
of the importance of persons as opposed to
ideas in her novels. “You are either for me
or against me,” she cries. “But, might
respond the analytical person, “I seek to
understand you, and that state partly ex-
cludes any definitely consistent adopting or
either of the former two.” ’Tis not good
enough. She must have a definite discrimi-
nation as between the sheep and goats, which
is probably why Heaven and Hell have
always been more popular institutions with
women than with men. But life, continu-
ally in a state of flux and transition, denies
definiteness, and femininity’s static symbols
are foredoomed to failure. ....
It may be that woman’s non-critical. in-
tensely personal attitude to life has a biolo-
gical justification. Only fanaticism will call
forth the self-sacrifice that the cares ot
children impose through long weary years.
There is a wisdom in her emotional excesses
—a wisdom that is reckoned not by logical
reasons but by results.
T. JASPER.
The Theban Eagle
Pindar is reading only for a few, and the
most of those few need the commentator at
hand. And yet, for all that, it is hard to
sec how one can dispense with him alto-
gether. Some of the glory that was Greece
shines on ns only out of the golden gloom
of his verse. When the imagination of the
world closes its eyes to the launcliing of Argo
and its ears to “the thunder of Pontic seas,
then the fourth Pythian may be forgotten.
As long as the Centaur haunts our art we
must visit the third Pythian for the wise,
mild majesty of Chiron. Both Gray and
Matthew' Arnold have “conveyed” the shin-
ing prelude to the first Pythian, the lyre
ringing through the courts of Heaven and
the enemy of Zeus writhing beneath the
weight of Etna. It is, by the way, remark-
able how Arnold, who contributes a magni-
ficent touch to the picture of Typho—
Letting the sea-stream wander thro’ thy hair —
should have utterly ruined the opening
The lyre’s voice is lovely everywhere,
that, distressing dissyllabic “lyre” followed by
“voice”! With Gray and Arnold and Arch-
bishop Trench, and with many a passage of
many a poet, there is enough Pindar in our
own poetry to make him still indispensable
to us. But there is one thing which it has
vainly been sought to transfer or “convey
—the “ample pinion” of Gray's exact and
memorable phrase.
It cannot be done. Let Gray and Swin-
burne print the terms “strophe” and “anti-
strophe” in their margin as much as they
please, the Greek “turn” and “counter-turn”
refuses to inscribe itself within the more
rigid “stanza.” We cannot escape from the
Provencal forms; the ring of rhyme marks
off different lengths of one and .the same
measure; abandon the rhyme (as Shelley in
“Queen Mab,” or Southey), and there is only
formlessness. But Pindar begins with cer-
tain ultimate metrical figures, which he can
combine into greater figures of varying com-
plexity and volume, out of which again he
builds the members of his triads. Add now
the powers of an inflected language, the
correspondence of far-flung units of the one
phrase, and you will admire, with Jebb, Pin-
dar's “way of gathering up word after word
into the sweep of his advance.” Most
splendidly, perhaps, does this _ self-high-
powered potency of language, as identity of
double movement, sense-design and musical
phrase, come out in Pindar’s magnificent
resumptions. Here is one right at the open-
ing of the first Pythian (bare literal trans-
lation will be our best aid towards some
adumbration) ; “Thou dost quench ever the
warrior levin of everlasting flame, and the
eagle sleeps on the sceptre of Zeus, his swift
pinion on either side relaxing.” It is done;
the eagle’s wing-tips brush the ground, the
sense is run out, the strophe is complete.
And then, a surprise ever gloriously new,
the counter-turn picks up with the grandiose
apposition, “Lord of all birds,” and carries
his sleep on for half its own scope. For such
effect, frequent in Pindar, there is only one
adequate description; it is to be found in
Keats’s “Hyperion” :
Saturn’s voice from thence
Grew up like organ that begins its strain
Afresh, when other harmonies, fall’n mute,
Leave the dinn’d air vibrating silverly.
It was not meant for Pindar, but it fits
exactly; and we must be content with it as
with Gray’s “ample pinion” and Jebb’s prose
equivalent for that.
The special Pindaric quality of poetry can,
then, only be “transfused” on another lan-
guage by a poet of kindred genius. But per-
haps something might be done for the general
with a little book of “Tales from Pindar”—
he abounds in such splendid tales —not in
the style of the so-called prose translations
(Heaven forbid!), but rather employing to a
better end that paraphrase to which they,
too, are driven. Far be it from me to offer-
the following as a specimen; I have only be-
thought me of inserting it here lest Pindar
should suffer wrong. If he has the ample
pinion of the bird of Zens he has also its
swift pinion. He is not always delaying
his advance, not always massing up “the
turgid stanza.” The narrative that ends the
tenth Nemean (the placing is exceptional)
shows that he could match the great pinion
of the “Iliad” itself for ease in getting his
story under way and swiftness in the rush
of action.
The sons of Leda share their immortality,
day by day in turn, for “so Polydeukes had
rather live than be altogether a god and dwell
in Heaven after Castor had perished in war;
for Idas in some quarrel about oxen” (how
the otiose, though necessary antecedent, is
despatched!) “had wounded him with the
spear’s brazen point.” A few lines tell how
Idas’s brother Lynceus (the lynx-eyed) had
spied him out; they caught him alone and
laid him low, “and suffered a dire thing by
the contrivance of Zeus, for straightway the
son of Leda came in pursuit. They turned
to meet him hard by their father’s grave,
and from it they tore up the thing conse-
crated to the nether-god, the carven stone,
and flung it on the breast of Polydeukes.
Him they neither crushed nor checked ; but
storming on with swift javelin he drove its
brazen tip between Lynceus’s ribs. And
Zeus hurled on Idas the smouldering levin-
fire • and together all alone they burned
awsv.” How. every detail comes, precise
and vivid, just at its right point, no more
holding up the narrative than the rush ox
Polydeukes could be checked by the tomb-
stone which the sons sacrilegiously tore from
their father’s grave before the terror ot his
advance. And, worse than the lonely death,
to be burnt “all alone,” with no friend near
to perform the due rights, consumed by the
avenging fire. To the end the narrative keeps
its swiftness; Zeus gives Polydeukes Ins
choice, “and he had no double counsel in
mind but loosed the eye and then the voice
of Castor, the brazen-clad.” Not Zeus, as
the English translator has it: Zeus speaks
and Polydeukes stays not to think; without
a word he turns to his brothers corpse,
and
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
“Phoenix” and a Use for Critics
When Bon Jonson took a deep gulp of
the sack, banged on the table, making Drum-
mond’s sensitive nerves jump, and voci-
ferated “Shakspeare wanted Arte,” he be-
came the Perfect Critic, the type and symbol
of all the critics and reviewers to follow.
For he was applying the static criterion of
a decade’s aesthetics to the elusive vital .ty
of living works of art that moved outside
that decade’s perceptive powers. The capa-
city to detect the “futurous” elements in
contemporary work is rare. We find in
general two types of critics: one who praises
everything that submits to certain tempor-
arily accepted Aesthetic standards, and one
who praises everything that upsets those
standards. And both are really the same
mind; or, rather, one is the other inside-
out. Neither can see where a work moves
by some inner quickness of construction
into a new area of definition. The two
most significant productions of modern fiction
are “South Wind” by Norman Douglas and
“Antic Hay” by Aldous Huxley. Yet both
of these books are almost unknown, not only
to the general reader, but to the ordinary
critic. That critic is still fumbling about
between the dead, already putrescent for-
mulae of naturalistic fiction, an inheritance
from the arid French dicta of the Flau-
bertian era. finally entombed in the dusty
sociology of Galsworthy on the one hand,
and on the other the apparent revolt in
such modernistic writers as D. H. Law-
rence and Eugene O’Neill, who are really
only the last decrepit state of the forms
they seem to disrupt.
Lawrence’s reputation is based on the
extraordinary monotony and wretchedness of
his style. In all his works there is not a
single definition of character which shows
the hand of other than the most mediocre
of draughtsmen; and only those _ who think
that to have read Krafft-Ebing is to know
all about psychology could ever be deceived
by the pretentious and shallow dullness of
his tortuous analyses of consciousness. His
mysticism could be attained by anyone, who
read Blake for five minutes and a simple •
text-book on the Gnostics. In all the
tormented creatures of Lawrence’s mind
there is not one who is not either a patho-
logical subject or the merest puppet. The
immense assumption of profundity with which
he writes convinces the usual serious-minded
reader that he is in the presence of some
new vision, while he is only viewing the
last dim discursive palsy of a dying tradi-
tion. Similarly O’Neill is only a Pinero
gone wrong; his plays are Victorian melo-
drama written very badly. Even “Emperor
.Tones” is but the famous old melodrama
“The Bells” modernised, its appeal to fear
just as childish. In O'Neill also there is
no character-projection. The problem is
evaded by a pretence at “symbolic realism.”
Huxley has a delightful parody of this type
of play in “Antic Hay.”
Douglas, on the contrary, created in
“South Wind” a completely new method.
He re-stated a score of the novelist’s tech-
nical problems l ; by this one book he re-
orientated the whole future possibilities of
the novel. As far as I know, not a single
critic saw anything in it more than a
pleasant and scholarly production. The
vitality of a work is to be tested, however,
not by its effect in reviewers’ columns, but
by the manner in which it builds towards
the future. Huxley has taken over Douglas’s
method and applied it with a liveliness,
vivacity and range of character that goes
far beyond the latter’s reach. As a result
the Times’ Literary Supplement was annoyed,
the London Mercury undisturbed, and the
comments by Australian critics were either
that the story was not interesting or that
the characters were not life-like.
Still, one must admit a certain use in
critics. When one gets to know them well,
one can often detect by a certain kind of
abuse that a book is worth reading. Thus
I owe it to .T. C. Squire that he put Aber-
crombie’s “Phoenix” into my hands, and
Squire is the deadliest mentality at present
operating in England—l say this with full
knowledge of the claims of Middleton
Murry to be considered Chief Stultifier of
the Earnest.
I suppose it is necessary to state the
fact that Abercrombie is the greatest poet
writing in England to-day, for in Australia
we are too busy trying to keep up the idea
that a mixture of Mrs. Hemans and Swin-
burne is the true Parnassian breed to be
conscious that poetry, wonderfully good, if
not great in the highest sense, is being
turned out on the other side of the world,
and that the men who are doing it are not
Masefield, Drinkwater and Alfred Noyes.
When I call Abercrombie the greatest there
I mean that he alone has been able to apply
his imagery directly to the action of life.
“The End of the World” published about
eight years ago gave him this position, but
for a while after that he seemed to decline
in vigor, his last w r ork before “Phoenix”
being a rather silly thing called “Ham and
Eggs.”
Rhodope, whom Squire thinks false in con-
ception, is a thoroughly charming girl. There
are no contradictions in her being: she is as
completely “one” as she is completely desir-
able and alive. In theme and feeling the
play comes out of Shakspeare’s “Troilus and
Cressida” —a work to wdiich the modern mind
seems curiously responsive—but in itself is
wholly original. It comprehends in treat-
ment and style all that is best in the modern
variation of dramatic intonation and charac-
ter, and in the modern development of blank-
verse rhythms. Amyntor, the old man trying
vainly to recapture the dream of youth and
youth’s liberation from the sense of time; the
jealous wife; Phoenix, the rowdy boy full of
his own adolescent bravery, stumbling on
manhood through the kisses of Rhodope—all
these are defined deftly but clearly. Rhodope,
however, gives the play; greatness, for Aber-
crombie has infused into her a rare gaiety, a
happy charm of flippancy and of light desires
and laughters that is not to be found in our
literature since Congreve’s girls adjusted a
beauty-patch. She is the lineal descendant
of Rosalind and Cressida, of Charmian and
Iris; with Rosie in, “Antic Hay” she repre-
sents the first return to the true happiness of
sex since the Elizabethan spirit uttered its
last mockeries in the Restoration dramatists,
and later in the lonely figures of Burns and
Byron. The charm of these two girls anni-
hilates all those dreary wastes of our litera-
ture where the authentic gesture of love
simply does not exist, where no perfume of
femininity, no unalloyed delight in the loveli-
ness of the Spring’s desire, is to be found.
Abercrombie pelts Rhodope with light and
fascinating imageries, and the play is thick
with strokes of humor and merriment—the
rough wooing of the soldier; all Rhodope’s
retorts. Minor felicities crowd on the pen.
Never was Squire’s instinct more correct
than when it told him to attack this play.
For here is every quality that outrages a
critic. The work is original in form, taking
the shape dictated by Abercrombie’s mind:
it is new and happy ; life is bright and glad
in it; it is not a problem-play, for there are
no problems to the man who realises that
joy in life is the only reason, excuse or vindi-
cation for art —there are no problems, there
is only life. It is light-spirited and yet
built on a foundation of grand form. Let
all such works perish, for either they or the
Squires must. I have my own opinion as to
which will ultimately go under, or, indeed, as
as to which has gone under. But this
article is not intended as a prophecy. It is
merely an expression of thanks to Squire.
JACK LINDSAY.
A Satchel of Books
Heather of the South, by Rosemary Rees (Herbert
Jenkins). A simple story told in a straightforward
manner. It deals with love and misunderstanding
and final rapture all on a Maoriland farm.
Forty-two Fables of La Fontaine, translated by
Edward Marsh (Heinemann). Not, in any sense, a
students’ “crib,” but La Fontaine up to date. The
reader will find many little homely thrusts to set
him guessing.
Mostly Moonshine, by Madeleine Nightingale
(Blackwell). An attractively got up book of verse
by an author whose name has been attached to earlier
collections. Her work is not marked by any distinc-
tion, but is graceful in its commonplaceness. It is
illustrated with woodcuts by C. T. Nightingale.
The Man in the Brown Suit, by Agatha Christie
(John Lane). A creation with the crimson thread
that fills this lady’s spools. In an ingenious mystery
story murder and diamonds are the dice with
which men play, while a detective flapper looks on at
the game, seeing more than is meant for her pretty
eyes, A gripping yarn.
The Pearl of Fortune, bv T. R. St. Johnston
(Selwyn and Blount). The Colonel who is The author
of this novel served in various official capacities in
the South Seas and during the period collected much
information relating to the customs of the islanders
and their folklore and legends. He thus comes well
equipped to the task of story telling, and with a
reputation well earned by “The Islanders of the
Pacific” and other publications. “The Pearl of
Fortune” is a story of adventure, showing a more
than usual acquaintanceship with the conditions ot
life in the South Pacific.
The Same Star, by E. V. Lucas (Methuen). The
reading public has wandered in Lucas’s delightful
company through'old London, through Paris, Venice
and Florence, through the world’s great galleries of
art. Now for the first time he comes forward as
dramatist. After reading this comedy in three acts
his old readers will regret the adventure. It merges
into burlesque, and, though affording amusement, falls
short of the author’s standard.
Blind Man’s Buff, by Louis Hemon, translated
by Arthur Richmond (Macmillan). By the author
of “Maria Chapdelaine.” A brilliant book with a
blessed symmetry about it which distinguishes it from
most psycho-analytical novels. It is a study of si
young irishman working on the London wharves
who hears the socialist millennium preached and then
the Christian, and when neither arrives turns on
the nearest symbols of oppression, the police, and
goes out in a gory battle. Quiet satire and fine
pictures in a severely classic frame.
What the Devil Told the Doctor, by Vaughan
Bateson (Tetley & Son). A doctor’s account of the
exploits of his comrades in the Camel Corps, and at
Gallipoli. What the doctor asked the Devil was:
“Whatever good can come out of all this hell, this
murder of brave boys, this pain and agony here and
at home? Tell me that!” The Devil, who is
gifted to the limit of boredom with flowing speech,
replies at great length, the general effect of his
answer being that humanity is inclined to over-rate
its importance in the cosmos; that, after all, the
scattering of a little cosmic dust doesn’t matter
much, here or there. But the doctor has the last
word, and finds a solution in the vision of universal
brotherhood.
Missionaries and Annexation in the Pacific, by
K. L. P. Martin (Oxford Press). The trader, the
missionary and the Imperialist go into the dock.
The German firm which fostered inter-tribal war,
supplied arms to both sides and crushed competition
with the help of native chiefs, is an example of the
trader; the Rev. W. S. Baker, who became Prime
Minister of Tonga and was finally deported, is an
example of the unrestricted missionary; Lord Derby,
who snubbed Australia’s requests for British annexa-
tion, is an example of the dilatory Imperialist.
Eventually Germany got into New Guinea and
France into the New Hebrides and other islands.
The British Foreign Office can be blamed for that;
but our own Government must take its share for
permitting the latest interlopers into the Marshall
Islands.
To the Frozen South, by A. .T. Villiers (Davies
Bros.). In November, 1923, a Norwegian fleet of
six vessels entered the port of Hobart to finally pre-
pare for a voyage to the South to hunt for whales.
The old fishing grounds have in recent years become
depleted, so Norway has turned its attention to the
region of the South Pole. The fleet was divided into
three sections, the assembling ground being the
river Derwent. Capt. Carl A. Larsen was in com-
mand of the expedition, and among the crew was a
scientist and naturalist representing the Royal
Museum of Stockholm. The writer of this interesting
account of the expedition shipped as a working hand
and took part in the labor of the crew, at the
same time making notes for 15 articles subsequently
contributed to Hobart Mercury. This amply illus-
trated book is a reprint of the articles. A graphic
account of the modern system of whaling is given.
“Quiet.lv and surely” the skipper of one of the fleet,
“took long and careful aim at the interminable grey
flank slowly turning before him. At last, his fore-
finger twitched ever so slightly and, with a boom
and a roar. .. .the great shell-pointed steel harpoon
flew out, and in a flurry of boiling foam the stricken
leviathan sounded in a terrible effort to rid himself
of the burning steel. But his doom was sealed.”
There is fascination for adults as well as youth in
the chronicle.

In the Country Home not served with electric
current the lady in the home is still working far
harder than necessary. She needs more time to
devote to her children and to make her home more
comfortable and beautiful.
She needs equally as much as her partner, and
perhaps even more, the freedom from drudgery
that electricity brings.
Consider the value of correct lighting alone.
Good lighting in the farm home and in and
around the farm buildings probably contributes
more to the comfort and happiness of all members
of the family than any other single convenience.
Every member of the family uses this convenience
in all hours each day, and more days of the year,
than any other one thing— even including the
automobile.
The value of sufficiently bright lighting pro-
perly located and protected, and instantly avail-
able by tipping a switch, can hardly be over-
estimated. Oil lamps burn the oxygen out of the
air, making it unfit to breathe, and thus often
cause ill health.
The comparatively poor light they give discourages reading
and study, and if used extensively may impair the eyesight. With
them there is the ever present danger of fire.
Electric lighting is odorless, consumes no oxygen, and gives
the most flexible kind of artificial illumination with the least danger
of fire.
It is of such great value to rid the country home of the fire
danger of oil light that it cannot be estimated. The (g) Home
Light and Power Unit supplies this medium. In addition it will also
drive the electric clothes-washer, electric dish-washer, electric
vacuum-cleaner and electric iron, electric toaster and electric
percolator.

To a Child.
Little pink maid
With stars in your eyes,
You are so dimpled and soft and wise
You are not afraid , ,
To speak to the world with two words only.
I think the trees and the birds were lonely,
Tired of green and tired of song
With waiting so long
To hear your laughter
Come chasing after
The sweet of the day.
Only you say, “I see ! I see!
But that is enough for a bird and a tree
To keep them good on the old earths knee;
And that is enough for all the seven
Great angels standing tip-toe in Heaven
And surely enough for me.

Three Songs.
I.
Oh, I would sing.
Oh, I would sing
Of the hot sands in the sun,
The little white waves that one by one
Up to the ti-tree swing,
Of the coarse sea-grass
And the clouds that pass
O’er the dunes on shadowy feet,
And the wind’s cry,
And a lad’s cry,
And the gulls with their little red feet!
11.
My song shall be of apple-boughs
That still as moon-light stay,
Red-fruited ’gainst a Summer sky
In brilliant applique. _
With arms as brown as nuts I lie
Below that filmy blue
And feel the sun ’mid crisp young leaves
Come greenly filtering through.
Once, long ago, old apple-boughs
Patched burning skies for me—
Oh, far away that Summer day
When in the orcliard-dceps I lay
In fairy Brittany!

Oh, I would sing a splendid song
Of my love, but I’have no words!
I have left my lyre, where its strings be-
With° the fresh, sweet earth, and the sky
above,
And the shy little bushland birds.
I would sing a song of my first white love;
But I have no words!

Treasure-Gathering.
Having lights of gold in plenty,
Summer is a lavish spender;
Wherefore, thankful of his largesse,
When the seeking-fit is on me,
Light of heart I go a-faring
To some scene of sylvan splendor.
Such a scene to-day I witnessed.
Having travelled bush-ways rooty,
Bracken-covered hills and hollows;
Such a scene as Nature colors
When she works with mood impassioned
Thrilled and all-possessed by beauty.
And such music! Oh, to hear it—
Sunshine gilding, shadow greying
Aisle and alley—was enchantment!
Now grey thrushes were its makers,
Now ’twas distant water-voices,
Now a breeze through leafage straying.
Gold I gained that was not minted,
Wine unbuyable I tasted,
Sense enchanted, soul uplifted ;
Having gathered so much treasure,
Banked such riches to my credit.
Who shall say my day was wasted?

The Spirit of Beauty.
Spirit of beauty! They who seek it know
That dawn and dusk are woven in the spell
Of witchery and color ecstasies,
Blue lilied pools, star-eyed anemones
And autumn-tinted leaves that whisper low
To umbrous palms where satin bower-birds
dwell.
Who would be freed from its enchanting
power ?
It bids us all our sorrows to forget
The morning’s dewy feet are crimson tinged,
Her gorgeous trailing mantle, golden fringed,
Catches the mountain crest, the fretted
tower
And ambushed in a rose’s heart is set.
Its purple grace is in the passion-flowers,
Silk of hibiscus, scarletly aflame,
The orange gold which vests the setting sun,
The opal threads with which fair dreams are
spun.
To splendid youth, in blue and silver hours,
The poetry of motion breathes its name.
It lies in the solemnity profound
Of night, wdien, trembling on her golden
throne —
A white flow r er, leaning o’er the violet air—
The moon-maid listens-in to music rare
Broadcasted on the frailest waves of sounu,
As pulse by pulse the azure notes are
blown.
All color and all life must end in death
To live anew; and beauty still will sit
Upon the pinnacle of earthly things,
Painting in ravishing emblazonings
Fresh seas of color when we yield our breath
To seek some place of dreams more exqui-
site.

HIS ONLY HOPE.
“Mr. Baldwin’s speech deeply impressed the House of Commons. He pointed out that employer and employee carried a h u ge responsibility. Whatever form evolu-
tion was taking it must be in the direction of closer partnership, the terms of which could not be laid down by statute. They might be called cowards, ) but were confident
that their desire for peace would be re-echoed, and that there were many in all parties who would join in his prayer, ‘Give peace in our time, O Lord.'"
THE PATIENT (to Doctor and Nurse): “I think you might pull me through if you worked together, instead of spending half your time tying
to poison one another.”

THE SECESSION TALK.
It was assumed in earlier and more san-
guine days that the permanency of the Com-
monwealth was a matter of course. Now the
question is raised, not only whether it has
come to stay, but whether it will stay long
enough to save its original arrival from being
ridiculous. In Westralia there is an un-
doubted and probably a growing secession
movement. It is based largely on pomp and
vanity, but that doesn’t prevent it being real.
The separation movement of Jeff Davis
and his “chaffy seceshers,” as the scornful
described them in 1860-61, was to a great
extent pomp and vanity, yet it was very
real. Westralia is inflated by its size, and
by the pride of its golden past, and by the
sky-scraping quality of its record debt. Its
politicians blame the Federal tariff and inter-
state freetrade too exclusively for the indus-
trial decline which really ended in 1917 and
was succeeded by a remarkable recovery, and
they give mighty little consideration to the
fact that the Westralian factory employee
insists on being the best paid in the Com-
monwealth, and gives in return the least
value. The State is aggravated by the opera-
tion of the Navigation Act, which certainly,
as it has been turned to account by anar-
chistic cranks, has been calculated to em-
bitter the holy angels; and it makes small
allowance for the fact that it was supplied
with a great railway at the general cost, to
make it partly independent of the sea and
the Act. Having got all the special conces-
sions that seem immediately available, the
West shows increasing signs of a willingness
to secede, presumably taking with it the 454
miles of Federal line which lie inside W.A.
territory, and possibly taking also its share
of the Federal debt. Provided the liability
was adjusted on the basis of present popula-
tion it should be a very small amount per
head in the future, for the possibilities of
accumulating inhabitants in so great a space
are very large. Tasmania, of course, gained
no Federal railway, and, in fact, barring a
petty subsidy, it gained nothing from the
Commonwealth, while it suffered the loss of
much of its shipping business through the
operation of the Navigation Act, and had
spells of complete and disastrous isolation
when somebody like Walsh was defying the
law, and those in charge of the law lacked
the nerve to defy Walsh. In Tasmania talk
of secession is common enough. And there
are times when South Australia feels sore
enough over the Commonwealth’s default in
the matter of the Northern Territory railway
to secede with a light heart.
* * * <
The Commonwealth has ceased to be an
inspiration. There is no reason why it
shouldn’t resume being one on a better scale
than ever, but that will only be when it is
run by big men with Australian ideas. There
was a vision that Federation would lead to
early settlement in that vast area of the
country where the need for it is most urgent.
The vision has proved a dud up till now.
The western North is just about where it
was. The middle North, which is the Com-
monwealth’s own Northern Territory, has
retrograded because of a Prime Minister who
handed control over to the A.W.U. and the
Communists, and sluggish successors who
allowed matters to drift. The extreme east-
ern North has progressed in ipoderation,
partly because of the Federal aid given to
the cane-sugar industry. At the end of 1923
the northern division of Queensland, which
is purely tropical, contained 138,939 inhabi-
tants. That was eminently respectable by
comparison, but not otherwise. Like every
other tail-end of an over-large State the place
is governed from too far away. The Com-
monwealth hasn’t acquired or attempted to
acquire the authority to make new States.
Its rulers haven’t endeavored, by persuasion
or otherwise, to induce the over-large States
to cut themselves up, though subdivision in
return for concessions should be a possible
policy with diplomatic handling. And the
Commonwealth has done nothing with its
own State — the middle North, with an area
of 523,620 square miles —to set a brilliant
example which the self-governing sections of
Australia might be constrained to follow. A
few days ago Prime Minister Bkuce was
quoted in this strain :
Referring briefly to the remark made on Saturday
in London by the former Secretary of State for
the Colonies (Mr. Tiiomas) that there were 50,000
prospective migrants ready to go to the Dominions,
and that it was not the fault of Britain or the
Colonial Office tfmt they had not left, “there has
never been any trouble about getting suitable
migrants for Australia,” said Mr. Bruce. “So far
as the Federal Government is concerned the trouble
has been to get the various States to take the
migrants. The Commonwealth cannot itself bring
migrants to Australia. It brings them only on
nomination or on requisition from the States.”
That is a helpless, not to say boneless, atti-
tude for the head of a Government which
has been entrusted with the sacred duty of
peopling 523,620 square miles of Australia.
* * * *
In the days before so many persons began
to grow tired of the Commonwealth an idea
prevailed that it would do things to keep the
community alive and interested. A great
deal of uniform legislation was expected, as
provided for in the Constitution, to simplify
existence and diminish legal charges. Some
eventuated, largely of a quite surprising sort.
There have come to pass a uniform compul-
sory voting law in imitation of the one which
contrives to bring only 82 per cent, of the
electors to the poll in Queensland; a uniform
baby-bonus law, which was guaranteed to
raise the birth-rate, though the only visible
result, after the expenditure of enough money
to provide a cross-Australia railway, has
been a shocking fall in the rate; and a uni-
form Arbitration law, which, duplicated with
the State laws, has made endless expense
and confusion. A uniform law about the
signing of political writings at Federal elec-
tion times was apparently devised for some
small and cat-like purpose which is hard to
identify, and the uniform Navigation statute
has destroyed the shipping of the Northern
Territory, and has greatly reduced that of
Tasmania, while in Westralia it begins to be
quoted as sufficient cause for secession. But
the unused powers of the Commonwealth still
include uniform statutes dealing with bank-
ing, insurance (including some protection
against the shady little premium-hunting con-
cerns that now swarm after the manner of
rabbits), with companies _in general, mar-
riage and divorce. There is a uniform bank-
ruptcy statute, but it is in suspense, like
the transcontinental railway, pending the day
when the mandarins of the land get their
speed up. The consolidation of the State
debts, by which the Commonwealth might
create and maintain a uniform sinking fund,
remains a dead-letter. A dozen millions or
so have been dissipated on a Federal ship-
ping line, which isn’t in the bond, while the
army (and defence is in the bond) has prac-
tically disappeared.
* * "
There lies ahead a possibility which coiild
be relied upon to bring about the dissolution,
or a very serious attempt at one. That
would be the advent of a Labor Government
which took in earnest its policy of unifica-
tion and the abolition of the Senate, and was
sufficiently strenuous over the matter to
create alarm. The vanishment of the House
in which the three dissatisfied States hold
half the membership would leave them with
22f per cent, of the voting power instead of
their present 314 per cent., and reduce them
to the status of Ireland in pre-Home Rule
days. They would certainly prefer to resign
the balance of their voting power and quit if
a revolutionary change of that size appeared
imminent, and the clatter of fools may make
it appear imminent.
MERELY MARY AND THE FUTURE.
Foretelling the future has not yet become
an exact science. Most of those who have
worn the mantle of the prophet have
been either wild guessers or persons whose
utterances were too vague to be regarded
with any confidence; but when an inventor
with the remarkable record of Dr. Fournier
d’Albe tells us what he sees in lorg-distance
imaginings it is at least respectful to take
notice. A thousand years hence, according
to this man who has photographed sound and
clone other feats of modern wizardry, the
world will be happy, ‘‘freed of wai, disease,
poisonous insects and other ills." Cooking
will become a pleasant art;. clothes will be
strong, but "so light that six suits can be
carried in a handbag”; and all the world
will be under one Government and speak one
language. It is almost 2000 years since
Virgil told the Romans a fairy tale of the
same pattern; but the man from Mantua
was wiser in that he named no date. Had
hr. fixed it at 1000 years and been wakened
at the correct time, he might have, been
excused for promptly dying again of disgust.
He would have found a l'Jurope sunk in
ignorance and dirt, and a ragged Rome living
on religious alms amid the ruins of the old
buildings. Instead of a productive earth of
little labor and boundless harvests he would
have found fretful peasants scratching for
bare life in small corners of what had once
been fruitful fields. The prophet of to-day
may be better or worse than the prophet
of Rome; but a thousand years is a long
time and guessing at the shorter range of
half a century might be safer. It is by no
means difficult to say that certain things
will be done in the art of flying, in the
development of wireless and in the increase
of facilities of intercourse; but all these
things are dependent upon a certain stability
in political relations. The mistake of a year
may be paid for in 10 centuries of loss.
* * * *
Not only does the course of mankind run
backwards and forwards over great periods
of time, but there are constant movements
of advance and retreat. We make no gains
without some corresponding loss; and in
striking the balance from generation to gener-
ation it is by no means easy to be sure that
progress is maintained. The Grecian of
Alexandria had no doubt that he had far out-
distanced the earlier Greek of Athens, lie
had made great progress in building, in
mathematics, in the area over which Greek
was spoken, in his knowledge of geography,
in organisation, in the spread of education
and in his extended commerce. He was much
richer, able to travel more comfortably, lived
in finer houses, wore better clothes and had
abandoned many superstitions. Very natur-
ally he considered himself in the van of pro-
gress ; but we, who have perspective to aid
our view, know that he was already far on
the downward road. Similarly, declining
Rome had no notion of its own decline. In
our own case we can point to great gains
and serious losses, and the balance which
would show us where we are is hard to
strike. In the matter of we eat much
that our grandfathers knew nothing of; yet
it would be a bold man who said we were
better fed than our grandfathers. The
improvements in the machinery of the world’s
textile industry have given us things to wear
out in great quantity. Yet our cloth is not
as good as the old produce of the hand loom;
and though women clothe themselves for the
hour in beautiful fabrics, the old laces and
embroideries preserved from a less produc-
tive age are always acknowledged to possess
greater worth and beauty tlian the best
achievement of the machines. Ours is an
age of books and general education; yet the
average quality of the books read has greatly
declined in the last 80 years. In the clos-
ing days of the seventeenth century any book
of real worth was certain to find publication
by the booksellers, who knew they had a
market for such work: to-day books are
actually declined by publishers because they
are too good for the public. In the great
sum of things facts like these may or may
not count; but in striking a balance it is
necessary to take note of them. We can
travel faster from land to land; but that is
not proof that we travel with better purpose.
The world’s increased knowledge is at our
command; but that is not proof that the
fuller knowledge is being put to better use
than the slender volume of accurate informa-
tion possessed by our grandfathers.
* * * *
In any attempt to forecast the immediate
future it is the seemingly little things that
count rather than the matters over which
much noise is made. It is upon the little
things that life is built; and the sum of all
the little things makes the progress or decline
of the age. Far more important than the
flight of the aeroplane—though not neces-
sarily unconnected with it—-is the condition
of home life. On that home life the progress
of the race has been built; and any progress
upon another foundation must be of another
kind. Communism, when not wholly con-
cerned with destructive effort, has outlined
a condition of common life in which the
home, as i we know it, could have no place.
Communal nurseries for infants, communal
kitchens, communal eating places and even
communal dormitories have been fore-
shadowed —all of them with the single pur-
pose of reducing labor and making life
easier. Under such conditions it is clear
that all home life must disappear and a
routine —perhaps labor-saving, perhaps the
reverse —take the place of all the cares,
anxieties and real interests of our present
forms of domestic life. The reply to all such
pictures of communistic society would seem
to be direct and convincing. Tens of thou-
sands of people are to-day living in hotels,
boarding-houses and service flats with all
the advantages which the communistic sys-
tem could offer and few of its disadvantages;
and the general result is loss. The people
—other than a few of the very wealthy who
can command comfort under any system—
invariably regard it with bitter distaste. The
privacies, intimacies, joys, hopes, failures,
successes, plans and individual fancies and
exercises of taste are all narrowed and re-
stricted by the substitution of a machine for
a home; and the desire for houses instead
of flats is a marked feature of the last few
years. A privately-owned house, whether
small or large, is not necessarily a home;
but it would seem to be the only possible raw
material out of which a home can be made.
Certainly all the homes of the past were
houses, even if only bark humpies or walled-
in caves; and the future must break largely
’ T ith the past if it is to find another founda-
cion for family life. Yet in trying to see
the future it would be futile to ignore the
fact that there has been a definite break with
the past in one important direction. All the
house-homes of the past depended for their
upkeep on the willingness of people to assist
others in domestic duties. The young women
who formerly made the household wheels
turn fairly smoothly are more and more look-
ing to other avenues of employment. With
their disappearance the home affairs must
take on a new shape. After a prolonged
struggle to secure the necessary aid to keep
houses formed on the pattern of the past
going, the inevitable return to the cottage
home of early European life must be the
rule in every white man’s country—that or
the all-round social slavery of a communistic
system. Far from seeking to fight against
such a change, it should be frankly wel-
comed. Invention has made the home tasks
easy; enthusiasm can make them a joy. The
little lazinesses of life are at the root of most
of the world’s despairs; the little energies
of life can probably do more in the way of
genuine reform than all the Arbitration
Courts and communistic theories.
SHIPS.
The roadstead of Singapore, where the Aus-
tralian flagship now lies with the warships
of Britain’s China Fleet, has been for thou-
sands of years the highway between East
and West. Through it, or 'the narrower
strait between the island and Johore, passed
the early Greek and Roman merchants, Ibn
Batuta and the Arab proselytisers, Fa
Hien and other Buddhist pilgrims from
China. The shrewd eyes of seamen have
conned each other’s rigs in those waters for
unrecorded ages; and one can still see there
the ships and styles of half the world and
of all history.
From the Malay West Coast comes the
most primitive, of all. It has a single square
sail exactly like those of the Egyptian vessels
depicted on the Tomb of API, 2000 b.c. The
Malay East Coast goes a step further. It
uses two of the same type as the West
Coast, the foresail being useful for running
off a wind and taking the strain off the
helm. The later Roman ships that carried
the tributary corn from Alexandria to Rome
were its twin brothers. It is the ancestor
of our European jib and staysail, which is
only three centuries old.
The towering bow and stern of the classi-
cal craft still survive in the fo’c’s’le and
poop of both the modern steamship and
the Chinese junk. The junk has been run-
ning down from China on the one monsoon
and returning with the other for hundreds
of years, and has never learned to work to
windward. It is a museum of antiquities.
The battens on the huge lateen sails, the
complicated network of the sheets, the single-
fluked wooden anchor, the great double rud-
ders hung in slings, the handspike and the
capstan, even the eye painted on the bow
which endows the ship with sight—all these
have their counterpart in the ancient ships. In
those wonderful passenger boats, crammed
with as many people as a Sydney ferry,
which thrash up the Whangpu River at
Shanghai, one sees the elder brother of the
modern rater. Even the humble sailing sam-
pan has some ingenious features. Its rudder
is perforated, apparently to let the dead
water escape, and it has a curious prolonga-
tion of the sides which form, with the tran-
som, a chamber open at the stern. In fun-
ning before the wind the chamber fills as
the boat mounts a wave and prevents her
running off; then as the stern lifts it empties
and leaves her ready for the next. Who-
ever the obscure architect was, he has solved
a problem for which Western yacht designers
still have no solution.
Easily the worst-built boats and the clever-
est seamen come from the little Sultanate
of Brunei, three days’ sail from Singapore.
Although the Sultan has a collection of
rusty bicycles presented by well-meaning
foreign diplomats, Brunei has only a hundred
yards or so of road, and water is the people’s
natural element. The great three-decker
Illanun prahus, that used to scour these seas
propelled by captive slaves, often with white
men amongst them, are gone; but occasion-
ally a big pakarangan, manned by sea gipsies
who never sleep ashore, puts in on dubious
business. The neighboring island of Pulau
Daat used to be their headquarters. A
lagoon with a narrow entrance penetrates
deep into the island, and the pirates, when
pursued, took their boats up to the head
of the lagoon, and, dragging them across a
strip of sand, launched them unseen on the
other side and escaped to seaward.
Harder to handle than the Brunei craft
are the beautiful little fishing-boats with
double outriggers which set out daily in their
thousands from the Java coast with the land
breeze, returning in the evening in the lap
of the sea breeze, like market-women with
arms a-kimbo and baskets full of spoil. If
the sea breeze fails hundreds of them may
not come back for weeks, but seek shelter
on whatever islands lie to leeward, some of
them finding there new homes and new wives
and gathering new families about them.
What an enormous revolution the discovery
of how to sail to windward must have
worked in the ancient -world, as important
to mankind in its day as the invention of the
Diesel engine! Who was the first magician
that, amidst the jeers of sceptical fellow-
villagers, set out with the new rig and hull
against that hitherto invincible gaoler, an
adverse wind, and conquered him? Such
is the crushing force of tradition that all
around the Java Sea, despite the example
of foreign vessels, the fishing-boats lie hauled
up like dead grasshoppers along the beach
for half the year because nobody has dared
to alter the ancient rig and build a boat that
will work out against the wet monsoon.
To such a landsman as I the sea is simply
a street procession which is looked at from
the pavement; nevertheless it leaves a few
indelible pictures on the mind: of a full-
rigged ship ramping through a flock of native
craft in the narrow waters of the inland
sea in Japan; Thames’ great mouth yawn-
ing in the grey of a wartime morning with
ships of all the world walking in and out
of it; Australia’s first Armada passing in
the Red Sea —November, 1914—0 n its way
to Egypt and the epic tragedy of Gallipoli;
and Kampong Melayu in the evening when
the white-winged dukongs are returning,
their graceful tall triangles of sail swaying
from side to side and their long, black out-
riggers streaming through the water snakily,
their helmsmen having some to-do to get
through the crowded channel between the
black heads of swimming children, women


groping for shell-fish and the statuesque Jala
throwers, and every arrival making a fresh
point of vividly-tinted animation on the
crowded beach. For the student of the evolu-
tion of the ship, however, no place in the
world is so fascinating as the great road-
stead of Singapore.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Financial Wrecks and Unfinancial Ships.
Complications and rumors of complica-
tions accumulate around the Commonwealth
shipping line. A recent statement was to
the effect that the Seamen’s Union had taken
alarm at the threatened sale of the fleet,
which would have meant the retirement from
business of the most lavish paymaster in
these seas. The union’s treatment of the
paymaster may not have suggested gratitude
for the lavishness, but that is a matter by
itself. The tale went that Walsh’s insti-
tution had gone so far as to offer a cash
deposit as security that awards would be
observed and job-control abandoned for the
future, provided the Federal ships continued
to ply on the old conditions. Even _ if the
offer was wholly authentic certain difficulties
stood in the way of acceptance, these being
the most obvious :
The deposit might not be large enough.
Any attempt to forfeit it in case of an alleged
breach of the contract would probably lead to more
expensive law proceedings than the amount was worth,
and would certainly be regarded as a casus belli of the
most virulent description. Also the first Labor Gov-
ernment would be relied on to refund the lost deposit.-
To maintain the service on the present money-
losing scale, or even on a modified scale of loss,
as payment for not breaking the law, would be too
much like the case of Ethelred buying off the Danes,
and no one has much respect for poor old Ethelred.
He has been at a discount for 909 years.
And it wouldn’t be dignied for the Government to
provide for its own safety while leaving other
shipping concerns in the lurch.
For these and probably other reasons the
Prime Minister announced that he would
stick to his plan of selling the luckless little
shoal of arks on conditions; and these con-
ditions are bound to make it impossible to
get for them the price of unconditional arks.
The buyers, according to Bruce’s present
ideas, are to keep the vessels. on the Aus-
tralian track, whereas other lines have the
world to choose from. They are to join no
ring or combine, but to be non-unionists at
sea. And they are not to raise fares and
freights. On this basis Bruce is prepared
to deal at a fair price, but not otherwise.
But what is the fair price of a collection
which is sure to incur the animosity of the
unions if it cuts off privileges and frills in
order to save money, which will enjoy the
animosity of the shipping combine, which is
leg-roped to a particular run so that it can't
flee from the animosity, which can’t take
full advantage of a boom in freights, and which
can’t be traded off except to non-unionist
owners? Even if a sale is effected on terms
satisfactory to the Government, the advantage
of all this fuss may be small. As
the ships wear out, or burn out, or sink out,
they are likely to be replaced not by vessels
of this line, but by vessels of some other
line belonging to the same owners, and one
which has no embarrassing conditions
attached. If business calls for more ships
the new craft will also belong to the other
line—the one with no awkward conditions
attached. There may be some idea of
specifying that the ex-Commonwealth line
must be kept up to its existing strength, old
ships being replaced by new ones under the
same terms, so that it will be a hampered
and tied-up institution till Judgment Day,
but in that case offers are likely to be very
scarce. To stipulate for the enlargement
of the fleet by the addition of more leg-roped
ships is beyond imagining. One probability,
therefore, is that the concern will be left
on the Government’s hands, with all its draw-
backs. Another is that it will be sold at
a low price because of the drawbacks, and
that the service acquired by this sacrifice
will be short-lived, either through accidents
of the sea which dispose of many unprofit-
able ships, or by accidents of the law which
dispose of many bargains that were thought
to be waterproof.

The Golden Dole.
This office has been enriched with a printed
copy of the case for a bonus on gold, pre-
sented to the Royal Commission which went
to Westralia to learn all about the suffer-
ings and losses of that State through Federa-
tion, and its claims on its neighbors for more
aid. The bonus is required, so it is alleged,
to save the gold industry from “irretrievable
loss and perhaps final ruin.” though, as gold
isn’t an annual crop like sugar or wool, nor
a constant one like the output of a factory,
the “final ruin” is assured in any case when
the deposits give out. Finally, it is urged
that there is nothing parochial or local in
the demand, for gold-mining “does not belong
to one State only, as does the heavily pro-
tected sugar industry of Queensland.” On
the figures supplied, however, there is a dis-
tinctly local aspect about the scheme, and
it is difficult to imagine why there should be
such a purely local demand for the bonus
otherwise. The proposed payment is fl
per ounce, which, the writer estimates, would
be £670,827. according to last year’s output.
Therefore, the whole population of the Com-
monwealth would contribute about 2s. 3d.
each per year towards the good work. An
above-the-average contributor to the Federal
revenue like S. Australia will pay more,
and a below-the-average one like Westralia
will pay less, but 2s. 3d. Is about the general
figure. And the distribution of the money is
to be like this: —
Recipients of Proposed Gold Bonus.
For each Inhabitant
For the State. of the State.
Westralia .. £485,035 £l6 9
Queensland .. 95,703 2 3
Victoria .. 67,167 10
Tasmania .. 3,450 4
N. S. Wales.. 18,675 2
S. Australia.. 787 • i
Queensland would come out about level.
Westralia would gain £442,170 per year if
the output remained stationary, and would
be the onlv gainer. The other four States
would contribute that amount to the Trea-
sury of their big neighbor, and be the only
losers. If the Commonwealth decided to pay
£670,827 per year as a bonus on copper in-
stead of on gold, the money would be more
widely distributed, and Tasmania, which
really could do with a pound or two, wmuld
win a little instead of losing; but no one
seems to have thought of copper. An argu-
ment advanced is that when Kalgoorlie gold-
field dies the place will become wilderness
again ; but that appears equally probable in
the case of Broken Hill (N.S.I\.) and
Queenstown (Tas.). A subsidy, it is claimed,
would postpone the break-up; but nothing
short of a living wage for all the unemployed
population would wholly avert it. No one
suggests that the Golden State should do
anything in return for the £1 per oz. bonus,
such as surrendering the northern half of
its unwieldy property, so that the Common-
wealth may make a new State out of it.
What is proposed is a wholly one-sided trans-
action. It might be a good investment, but
there is need for a library of evidence.
«
Taking’ Risks with the Public.
Melbourne newspaper opinion is inclined
to regard as SoLOMON-like the sentence
passed by the Chief Justice on a woman
motorist for the manslaughter of that useful
citizen, 11. Iv. Walker. He was knocked
down and killed by her car when, startled
by the nearness she had just been to running
over someone else, she had collapsed at the
steering-wheel. Nobody would suggest that
any drastic punishment was called for in
the case; none the less the C.J.’s decision
that the accused should enter into a bond
never again to drive a motor-car did not meet
the requirements. The penalty is merely that
which economic conditions enforce upon hun-
dreds of thousands of Australian women who
have never had any charge preferred against
them; and such praise of the judgment as
the Age offers in a sub-leader is surely pre-
posterous :
In the stem warning to reckless motorists, in the
reminder to them of their responsibility to the com-
munity and of the punishment inevitable on their
conviction, and in the very nature of the decision,
the Chief Justice has offered a salutary and sorely
needed lesson and a lead in disciplining these menaces
to public safety.
To call the sentence “a stern warning” to
others is palpably absurd. Whatever sym-
pathy there may be for the offender, a nomi-
nal —or less than nominal —sentence amounts
to a condonation of breaches of traffic regu-
lations devised to ensure public safety, at a
a time when the recklessness of car-drivers
is producing a “red roll” of tragedies. The
woman, who had no license, was taking the
risk of driving across one of the busiest in-
tersections in the world without any
adequate guidance—her husband, the only
person in the car with a license to drive,
was in a back seat. Even to conform to the
regulations he should have been sitting next
to the learner, where he would at least have
a chance to rectify her mistakes. Both hus-
band and wife were taking grave risks, and
to allow sympathy to interfere with insist-
ence upon their responsibility for their acts
is a dangerous weakness rather than a stern
warning.
Another Government Housing Scheme.
There recently arrived at this office, “with
the Attorney-General’s compliments,” a re-
print of a newspaper article which suggested
that the S. Aus. Labor Government was a
genuine wonder-worker in the housing line.
The writer told how the Government had
decided that suburban Adelaide should have
a thousand more homes ; how Joseph Timms,
the contractor, had undertaken to build the
whole thousand in 12 months for £636 15s.
apiece;-and how for £25 down or payable in
instalments and 17s. 6d. or 18s. 6d. a week
—a lot less than the private landlord now
demands —a family man would be placed in
possession of a dwelling which would become
his own property in 42 years. And no jerry-
built shack on a pocket-handkerchief allot-
ment either. “The houses are built of brick
throughout, and have either five or six large
rooms, with bath, gas, electric light, sewerage
and water service, an additional 400-gallon
tank for rainwater, and a Cyclone fence.
There are 14 designs, mainly on bungalow
lines, and successful applicants are given
their choice, with the proviso that no two
adjacent houses should be of the same design.
And each of the houses stands on a block of
land 50ft. by 150 ft.” The rliapsodist con-
gratulates the successful applicant on the
bonanza he has struck —“a six-roomed house
w r ith large rooms for £636, and the land cost-
ing £1 a foot, within four miles of the G.P.0.,
at the base of the foothills and close to
Brighton-on-Sea; and if the six rooms are
insufficient the contractor will build another
for £50.” Of the Governor-General it is
related that he was “amazed at the value
given for the money,” and that he “asked
for pamphlets and photographs” so that the
good news might be sent to .T. Bull. Also
Bowden, recently Minister for Defence, is
recorded to have “expressed his astonish-
ment at what he saw” since “the £lO5O
houses erected by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment at Canberra were much inferior to the
£636 homes under the Adelaide scheme.” And
the miracle was being accomplished without
robbing the contractor (“massed production
is the secret of his success”) or the work-
men : “the bricklayers, of whom there are
350, receive 255. a day, most of the carpen-
ters 235. 6d., plasterers 2s. a day more than
award rates, and laborers 17s. lOd. a day
and fares,” all for a 44-hour -week. “Here,
indeed,” wrote the enthusiast in a final
transport, “is a practical demonstration of
how to cope with the housing problem which
other Governments and municipal bodies
might well study.” It is to be hoped that
the practical demonstration will be studied
in all its bearings, for the crisis which seems
to be inevitable in Government undertak-
ings of this description arrived last week.
Remarking that he was sorry but it would
have to be done, the contractor closed down
the works and the men were paid off. Pre-
mier Gunn, in an agitated statement, spoke
of “vital delays,” and mentioned that, fail-
ing “immediate rectification,” the contract
would “either be determined or carried out
at the contractor's expense.” The prospect
of screwing any money out of an elderly
individual who ceases operations in the ninth
month of a £637.600 contract, with only a
few score of the thousand houses completed,
is too remote to be w T orth talking about. The
job has been thrown on the Government’s
hands, to be financed at the general cost,
and finished with as much expedition as the
Government stroke will permit. And when
the accounts are made up_ the taxpayer will
be extraordinarily lucky if he hasn't to foot
a staggering bill for the difference between
the price agreed upon with the purchaser
and the actual cost. The las.t Commonwealth
Minister who dealt w r ith the dismal story
of the war-service homes, which also had a
general stoppage early in the piece, estimated
the losses at £1,800.000, and said they would
be more. It will perhaps never be known
what the chaotic operations of the N. S.
Wales Housing Board cost the Ma State.
The Auditor-General, in his last report,
stated that he had just received the accounts
for 1920, ’2l, ’22 and ’23, and that the con-
tents were “so inaccurate as to hold out no
hope of their being certified by me without
drastic amendments.” Anyhow, a Parlia-
mentary Select Committee recommended the
Government to get out of the housing busi-
ness, even to rush out. After taking volumi-
nous evidence, and leaving dozens of willing
witnesses unexamined, it reported “gross mis-
management. carelessness, incompetence and
improper conduct,” as a result of winch
“large sums of money have been lost to the
State, and further losses must inevitably
occur.” It is in no wise astonishing that
these doleful fiascoes should have been wasted
on South Australia’s present rulers, for
Labor Governments have c, contempt for ex-
perience, and are nothing if not cocksure.
What is remarkable is that the Gunn .Min-
istry should have sent out a fantastically
absurd description of the venture only a
couple of weeks before the crash. It must be
precious raw.
O
Making the Pace.
The hesitations of the Fuller Ministry, of
N. S. Wales, would fill volumes. On a
recent day it hadn’t decided whether to make
some new appointments to the Upper House,
with a view to ensuring the passage of the
long-licsitated-over Marriage Amendment
Bill, or not. It hadn’t decided how many to
make if it made any. It was half inclined
to let the Bill slide till next Parliament. It
couldn’t make up its mind whom to appoint
to represent N.S.W. in the Senate in place ot
Power, deceased. After struggling with the
problem till it looked like a haunted skeleton
it half resolved to hang the matter up till
Parliament met, and half resolved to do
something else, and didn’t half know what
the something else might be. It is no closer
to deciding how to reform the Upper House
than it was at any previous time. It will
shortly have on its hands the report ot the
New States Commission and that of the
Sydney Corporation Corruption and Moral
Decomposition Commission, and it is evident,
from Ministerial utterances, that both will
find the Cabinet at a loose end and seated
on the habitual rail. There was no reason
to appoint either body save that the Premier
is incurably addicted to shirking a while
longer. All the first Commission could find
out was that some people believed in the
New State idea and some didn’t, and some
cared and some didn’t; after which the matter
would be summed up by a minor Judge, who
has spent his life in the big centralised city
that the New Staters object to, and imbibed
his traditions and his unconscious bias there,
and who knows no more of the subject than
the next man. As for the Municipal Decom-
position inquiry, it was obvious and noton-
ous, by reason of the big, glaring jobs that
were done or attempted in the light of day,
that the time had come for reform or aboli-
tion. The obliteration of the much-
manipulated lodger vote would have been
an obvious device, but it was easier to take
refuge for a time behind the superfluous
Commission, and let the party of corruption
get back to the loaves and fishes in the
meantime. The Fueler crowd still has ideas
about abolition or drastic alteration of the
Fair Rents muddle, which has practically
stopped the building of small houses for rent-
ing purposes, greatly increased the flat or
incipient-tenement-house habit, and driven
multitudes into the purchase of the shoddy-
exorbitant shack on the basis of ‘ small
deposit, balance as rent.” The ideas are
cloudy, but it hopes to act one of these cen-
turies. Progress would be possible, and
might even be rapid, if the head of a com-
posite Ministry had the knack of making it
clear that he had the casting vote, or several
casting votes if necessary, and that too
much argument would lead to resignation
and a new deal. There have been Premiers
who took up that attitude, though they could
ill afford to part with office. And there have
been and are rich Premiers who take no
chances, and are prepared to sink almost
everything lest the community should lose
the blessing of their services.

Sun Yat-sen.
“Feng-Siiui” goes to the funeral: —
The other morning I watched an impassive Celestial
climb out of an attic-window and attach a flag to the
halliards of a mast. It was the five-barred emblem of
the Republic. Everything Chinese is done the other
way round, and so the flag which was being hoisted
as a sign of mourning for the death of Sun Yat-
sen, first President, went right to the top. It was a
fitting symbol of the Chinese Revolution, which was
unlike any other revolution the world has ever
seen. Although the Republic has lost its founder
it still has an Emperor. It is not usual for Republics
to have emperors. They generally dispose of them in
a mock-legal way, as in the French Revolution, or :n
a mean, untidy fashion, as in the Russian. But
China is proud of Hsuan Tung, and, though some
extreme republicans insist on calling him Mr. Ching,
after the name of the dynasty, it is quite an illegal
thing to do, as his titles have been secured to him
by law. Except for a small but active section who
have listened to the doctrine of government by
violence introduced from Moscow, the people of
China are ruled by the Golden Mean that the
sage Confucius taught and are permeated with the
philosophy of Kung and Lao, who preached that
gentleness brings victory to him who defends, that the
best soldiers are not warlike and the best fighters
do not lose their tempers. Acting on these preempts,
that few Caucasians could summon the self-contrbl to
apply, the Chinese republicans hatched a revolution
which, if it had been allowed to take its course,trrtight
have provided a model and enhanced the attractions
of revolutions for other countries, depressed by the
Russian example. Acting on the principle, however,
that the poor man profits by a riot, Japan and other
foreign countries refused to allocv the movement to
follow a bloodless path, and it was not long before the
revolution became involved in complications which
13 years of intermittent warfare have failed to
straighten out.
Nevertheless, through all these distractions, the
Chinese republicans remained true to their unortho-
dox ideas about revolutions. After slaughtering a
mere handful of the hated Manclius, they rested on
their arms and gave their rulers the opportunity of
making a graceful exit. The Imperial letter-writer
v'as set to work, and composed a series of decreed
that will go down as probably the most remarkable
documents in Ihe history of revolution. “So long,”
says the first edict, “as the form of government re-
mains undecided, so long will the disturbed condition
of the people continue. It is clear that the minds
of the majority of the people are favorable to the
establishment of a republican form of government,
the Southern ai,id Central provinces first holding this
view, and the officers of the North lately adopting
the same sentiments.” This was a masterly sum-
ming up of the situation except that, far from a
majority of the 400 millions of China wanting a
republic, the greater proportion of them had never
heard the name, and were quite unaware- that the
thing was under way. However, the decrjee con-
tinued : “I, the Empress Dowager, together with the
Emperor, hereby hand over the sovereignty to be
the possession of the whole people, and declare that
the Constitution shall henceforth be Republican, in
order to satisfy the demands of those within the
confines of the nation, hating disorder and desiring
peace, and anxious to follow the teachings of the
sages.” The spectacle of a deposed monarch stipu-
lating the form of government the successful rebels
against his authority should adopt caused no laughter
in China.; nor did a smile flicker over the impassive
visage of the nation when the Empress Dowager pro-
ceeded to appoint Yuan Siiih-k’ai “with full powers”
to organise a provisional Republican Government in
agreement with the heads of the army, so that there
might be “complete integrity of the five races,
Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans and
Tibetans, making together a great State under the
title Chung Hua Ming Kuo, the Middle Flowery
People’s Kingdom.” Thus the meticulous lady even
supplied the revolutionary State with its proper title.
Nevertheless she could not resist having her little
joke. “We, the Emperor Dowager and the Emperor,”
she goes on, “will retire into a life of leisure, fret
from public duties, spending Our years pleasantly
and enjoying the courteous treatment accorded us
by the People, and watching with satisfaction the
glorious establishment and consummation of a per-
fect Government.” This is satire to which the
Bourhon king’s “Apres mot, le deluge” was brutal
chaffing. Another edict provided for the upkeep of
the Son of Heaven. He was to retain his titles and
the honor due to a foreign ruler, plus an annual
subsidy of $4,000,000; and he was to continue in
the Imperial City to perform the annual sacrifices
on which the security of the Empire and the
prosperity of the crops depended.
Until a few months ago the Revolution, which
has been pre-occupied with a civil war consisting
mainly of bloodless manoeuvres and foreign loans,
remained faithful to its bond. The Manchu boy
was allowed to grow to manhood amidst the iron-
capped princes, ladies, eunuchs, pomps and puerili-
ties of the Imperial Couxt. Once he was forcibly
(Ragged out of his palace by a general anxious to
set him up as the puppet of a counter-revolution;
but when the attempt failed the Emperor was
allowed to retire again, pursued by the apologies
of the revolutionaries at having had his august
repose so thoughtlessly distui'bed. It was not until
Feng Yu-hsiang, the famous Christian general, found
himself by an act of treachery in power in Peking
that the bond was broken and the Emperor forced
to leave his capital and seek Japanese protection in
the foreign concession at Tientsin. This move
marked the ascendancy of Russia in Peking. Sun
Yat-sen, whose administration in South China had
been frankly Bolshevistic, hurried to the North to
join a coalition whose curious object was to invite
the Soviet to reproduce in China an edition of
their own brand of Sheol and then take over the
ruins as a going concern. The old-fashioned way
of conducting the business seemed doomed to give
place to more bloody and efficient methods, when
Sun fell ill—which is also Pekingese for poisoned. The
inauguration of the Russian brand of revolution is
therefore postponed, but the scheme remains hung
up in a handy place for future reference, should the
omens become more kind.

Bosh, Bananas and Battleships,
“X.N.0.”: Vice-Admiral Sir Allan Everett
is reported from Singapore to have said that
the conference now sitting at that place will
no more discuss the proposed naval base than
it will the price of bananas. Any intelli-
gent naval officer could have told the public
that months ago. Coincident with Admiral
Everett’s “hot-air and bosh” interview- •
how breezy these admirals do get, to be sure ! ■
comes an account, of a protest b> Lord Wim-
borne, a Liberal member of the House of
Lords, against the spending of anything at
all at Singapore, because a Pacific boil-over
would “cause tension in Europe” and pre-
vent ships being sent East. It is rather hard
to follow the noble Lord's logic: Lord Hal-
dane was more intelligible when he said that
the development of Singapore would cause,
and was causing, distrust and suspicion in
Japan. Unless the Japanese can be genuinely
convinced that the British Empire has no
designs, and never means to have designs, on
Japan or her possessions, Lord Haldane is
quite right. Japan has not yet got it into
her head that “Defence, not Defiance” —
meaning really “Defence, not Aggression ’
is the motto behind the British Navy;
and until Nippon is so convinced, she is
bound to be suspicious when we contemplate
a naval station as near her front door as
w e can possibly get it without infringing the
Washington agreement. Recently, however,
an event occurred which may at some future
time have a very unfortunate result, and
which certainly in part justifies Japan’s sus-
picions. Some few months ago Admiral
Eberle. the U.S. Operations Chief, an-
nounced the plans for the much talked of
Pacific naval manoeuvres, and in the course
of his statement he unblushingly threw aside
all diplomatic considerations, and referred
openly to Japan as the possible enemy against,
whose dispositions the manoeuvres were
directed. Doubtless the statement was made
intentionally, and in order to obtain some
effect. If the U.S. thought it would frighten
the Japanese their judgment is very con-
siderably in error, and the only result up
to date'is the refusal of Japan to permit a
friendly visit by some of the American ships
to Japanese ports. If Smith were to mount
machine-guns on the roof of his house and
put a barbed wire entanglement across his
front door, and were then to announce to
the press that these precautions were taken
so as to be in readiness in case Brown over
the road were to attack him. he would pro-
bably have sufficient tact to avoid asking
Brown next dav if he could drop in to dinner,
especially if he and Brown were not too

£ood friends to start with. But except that
a Yankee-Jap war would be only a bit more
undesirable than a war between any other
countries, these things would not really con-
cern us very much if the U.S. hadn’t taken
the trouble to drag us into it. In the same
statement Admiral Eberle foreshadowed a
junction with the Australian Fleet as soon
as the Japanese had been disposed of. Not
one word of public protest has been uttered
by Australia to counteract the very bad effect
that this piece of international impertinence
must have had. Can the Japanese come to
any other conclusion than that Australia is
a party to America’s anti-Jap manoeuvres?
Of course not; and when on top of that
England proposes, with help from Australia,
M.L. and the others, to build a naval base
as near Japan as possible, then the Japanese
are entitled to be just as suspicious as we
were 20 years ago, when Germany started
to do exactly the same thing the other side
of the North Sea. If we are not to be re-
garded by Japan as hypocrites, steps must
be taken to absolve this country from the
consequences of America’s international dis-
courtesy. We have not yet been officially in-
formed of the U.S. Fleet’s forthcoming visit.
\\ hen we are the Prime Minister should ex-
tend the required invitation only on condi-
tion that America “tells the world,” to use
one of their own expressive phrases, that
Eberle’s connection of Australia with the
anti-Japanese objects of America’s manoe-
uvres was made without our approval and
against what our wishes would have been
had we first been consulted.

Wool.
Once more Australian sheep-growers count
themselves fooled. Wool values have
tumbled from the peak rates to the extent
of anything from 25 per cent, to 35 per cent.,
and deflation still goes on relentlessly. Wool
values, when they bolt, are like the progress
of a motor-car. A man may poke along at
2U to 30 miles an hour, and if he hits a
stone it gives him a bit of a jolt and that is
all; but if he is going at 50 to (50 miles an
hour and he hits the same stone, he is liable
to fall a long way in a little while. When
wool values are soaring, a very slight check
will cause grave results. Nevertheless, the
innocents turn round and ask—“ But how can
it be when there is such a shortage of wool?”
True, the world is using nearly three-quarters
of a million bales of wool more than it is
producing each year; but there is a limit to
the price at which it can be used, and when
the buyers find that they have paid more for
the material than they can trade it off at,
and have become financially exhausted, the
recoil is apt to be sharp. Any man will pull
his fingers out of the fire as quickly as he
can. Furthermore, if there are many that
have been scorched, there is likely to be a
rush to be first in getting the selfsame
fingers into the oil. And so a stampede
occurs. This is exactly what has taken
place since we were overpaid for our wool in
November last. The result is that we are
now getting less for our staple product than
if this foolish buying had never happened,
and, though many woolgrowers consider they
have lost money which they never owned,
there are many traders who have lost solid
cash in purchases which they wish they had
never seen. There is no more exact natural
science than economics, and it is foolish to
talk of “rigged markets,” “Bradford bears”
or unnatural interference with the law of
supply and demand. There are two sides
to this law, and when the demand side
becomes overburdened with price, it will turn
the scale against supply with a bump; or, to
vary the simile, when prices rise they will
gradually cut out demand, as surely as a
properly constituted battery will automati-
cally cut itself out when the cells on which
it operates are fully charged. If the battery
fails to cut itself out, there will be a mess,
as any engineer will tell us. High prices
for wool are justified, but when they are un-
naturally forced up a recoil is bound to
occur. We are still in a good position with
our wool, and, provided we keep our heads
and refrain from hysterics, all will be well.
The woolgrower might, however, remember
that he would not buy sheep, not matter how
scarce, if he could not see a profit in them,
and he must allow the other fellow the same
rights with regard to wool.

A Country that Needs a Tonic.
The war was fought to “make the world
safe for democracy,” and one visible result
is that it isn’t nearly so safe for a citizen
to be out after dark in Melbourne or Sid-
ney as it was before the great event. The
gaol population isn't increasing, but it
should be, and the mass of crime for which
no one seems to be responsible is piling up
m an alarming fashion. In Melbourne a
tendency is said to be growing for owners
of stolen property to disclaim all knowledge
of it, if the scarce and underpaid “force”
does make a re-capture. This is because of
a way the New Criminal has of conveying
an assurance that if the robber gets into
trouble on the evidence of the robbed the
latter’s harp and crown will be ready for
lu'm. Having much faith in the efficiency
of the thief-organisation for attack, and very
little in that of the Law organisation for
defence, the loser inclines, like the Yankee
of 1854, to vote the Know-Nothing ticket.
Plenty of reasons are forthcoming for the de-
moralised state of affairs, these being some
of them:—
The police force is too small, and the pay and
pensions are not commensurate with the risks.
The administration of the statutes, especially in
Victoria, is too much in the hands of J’s.P. wfio
often know remarkably little about them. J’s.P.
are as liable to be intimidated as other unarmed
and unaggressive citizens, and, having neither salary
nor pension, it isn’t worth their while to chase the
gentle art of making enemies. A small unpaid judge
with no regular jh° urs too much resembles an
undersized honorary constable who goes on duty in
plain clothes when he feels like it.
The Children’s Court business and the First Offen-
der trick are both overdone. Some of the children
are too large and fierce, and some of the first
offenders have been dodging apprehension too long.
Too muc(i is heard of the maximum sentence in
cases of violence and not enough of the minimum.
For some offences, especially those perpetrated or
attempted with that hideous apparatus, the bottle,
six months should be the least. Australia’s national
weapon requires to be put down for various reasons,
one being that it can disguise itself so easily as a
harmless container of refreshment, whiqh the gun
and the boomerang can’t.
Australia not having a law, as Canada and any
number of sane countries have, for the prompt and
AN ENTENTE CORDIALE.
“Prohibition authorities in U.S.A. are at their wits’ end how to store the 17,000,000 gallons of
contraband intoxicants seized during the last 12 months.”
FIRST DOSSER: “’Eve's Uncle Sam don't know how to store 17.000,000 gallons of
smuggled booze.”
SECOND DOSSER: “Cripes! Lead me to it!”
almost informal deportation of Communists and
such-like not born in the country, these pests Swarm
here. They not only practise common crime in
many cases, but they run schools of crime in which
the young are taught to regard civilisation as a
temporary evil, and law as a thing to be despised.
Governments which are the last word in passivity
take no measures with these folk, who beard his
Honor on his own bench with complete impunity.
Some day one of them with a foreign name will
shake his Honor in his own bench.
Further, there are too many flabby humanitarians
who hold that tjhe criminal, provided he is suffici-
ently horrible, is always a moron or ■ person of
undeveloped intelligence is in no way responsible—
that, at the worst, he should be put under mild
restraint amid pleasant surroundings, and not worked.
Where the police and courts are highly efficient prac-
tising morons are scarce, but they multiply as the
legal apparatus decays. Quite recently 14 morons,
armed with palings, appeared simultaneously in a
paddock or park in Sydney, and battered a stranger
almost to death, there being no police in the
vicinity. This was a large gathering of the feeble-
minded, but not unprecedented. It showed the usual
brisk intelligence in getting away.
Doubtless the extensive substitution of loans
for productive work has helped to bring
about a general slackening of the national
fibre. Government and tire administration
of justice are about the weakest things in
the Commonwealth to-day. A year or two
ago the price of beef for export made a
good third, but beef has strengthened, while
the other pair continue to fade.
Arbitration Judge Powers rashly came out
into the open with a complaint that State
Attorney-General Bavin had spoken of him
or his Court with disrespect, which is really
the thing that most people speak of them
with ; and Bavin replied {hat, after perusing
his Honor's remonstrance, any disrespect he
had felt remained in full bloom. The atti-
tude of the Court was that it wouldn’t de-
register the Seamen’s Union because that
body had quitted its evil ways and was
observing the award, and that to deregister
in that case would cause “bitter industrial
war for a long time” —a view in which Tom
Walsh concurred so warmly that it almost
sounded as if he was warning the Court to
keep off the grass now that it was off. As
a matter of fact, the union was only obeying
the law in spots—such spots as it pleased—
and it is doing that to this day. At times
the spots seem to become further apart.
Wherefore the chartered Commonwealth boat
Volumnia continued to be held up until it
liad completed four months’ idleness. And
when it got round to Sydney like a thief
mil it was only to be declared as
black as ever or murkier, and to find a
Westralian warrant awaiting the skipper for
leaving his strikers behind him. Wherefore
people continue to regard Justice Powers as
a rather unloaded weapon, and something in
the way of a blotting-papery tower of refuge.
xou can t come here and talk nonsense
like that, said Federal Justice Starke the
other day to the Seamen’s Union counsel in
another case. “It may do for the Arbitra-
tion Court.” In saying which Starke pos-
sibly barked out more of his mind than he
intended.
♦
Concerning a thief and other matters:—
Tins Bulletin has just had proof of the bright
memory of Australians. On March 5 it printed a
Btory, “My Hospitable signed “A.P.,”
which had been sold to it as original matter by
an old contributor. Before n a.m. on the day of
publication the first news came that “A.P.” was a
thief: the message to that effect was from a city
library. At noon a wire from Dubbo said the same
thing. By the afternoon mail three letters reported
the discovery. Within the next 24 hours Melbourne
and the back country were heard from. On Monday
morning the first Queensland letter on the subject
arrived —from Beerburrum; and the mail has been
busy ever since. The earliest correspondents could
only remember having read the yarn ; the first man
to definitely “place” it was ex-Attorney-General
Arthur Robinson of Victoria, one of the most
omnivorous readers alive, who remembered “reading
it in the Strand 20 years or more ago.” Next it
was traced to Tillotson’s, the literary agents: eight
or ten years ago they sold the Australian rights to
a firm which prints and publishes supplements for
country papers. Probably that is where The Bul-
letin’s thief got it. He tells the usual tale—that
a man (since dead) handed him the MS. and
assured him it was original. Needless to say, ’The
Bulletin doesn’t believe him and has put him upon
the Index. The Bulletin regrets that it imposed
on its readers, and thanks all those who communicated
with it on the subject.

“Fugue” : There is likely to he a brisk tight
over the new organ that is to replace the
instrument burnt in the Melbourne Town
Hall fire. Importing cranks are taking it
for granted that the new instrument must
be brought from overseas; but the Australian
Industries Protection League has got in early
with a demand that it shall be locally made.
The organ in the Melbourne Exhibition
Building—bigger than the Town Hall in-
strument and much more satisfactory— was
made in Australia; the new organ at All
Saints’, St. Ivilda, a local production, is a
masterpiece; so is that in Scots’ Church.
The old Town Hall organ was an importa-
tion ; and there was always trouble about
its pitch—it was largely responsible for the
weaknesses in a recent Philharmonic
Society’s production. The local organ-
builder knows how to meet local climatic
conditions; and that in itself gives a heavy-
weight backing to the demand that the work
should be kept at home.

It a given amount of drink is poured into
a given number of people, how full will these
people be in a given time, assuming that they
were empty to start with? That is one of
many U.S. problems. During 1924 the ap-
proaching liquor captured at sea amounted
to 1,700,000 gallons, and large quantities
were seized by the coastguard on landing.
Yet, despite losses and enormous expenses,
enough millions of gallpns got ashore to make
the trade pay, and the' fleet, carrying all the
Spring fashions in illicit rum, was lately
described as the biggest to date. Presumably
the manufacture of liquor ashore is also on
a big scale, like most other things there-
abouts. The “wave of crime” in the big cities
(whether a sober wave or a drunk wave or
a drug wave) has created something akin to
a panic, and it is said to be 35 times easier
to be murdered in Ncav York or Chicago than
in London. At a recent legal conference
held in New York it was alleged that the
law isn’t much good, and the courts aren’t
up to the mark, and the police force is pretty
dreadful. Advanced humanitarianism, it is
further alleged, has made the prisons of
New York State rather pleasant places, where
the confinees “can see the best theatrical
performances, enjoy baseball and the movies,
dine in a cafeteria, and work three or four
hours per dnv.” Drink is said to be tiro-
curable “inside”; and the “Parole Board”
spends its time in forgiving prisoners and
letting them out on their promise not to do
it again. A rum fleet roaming up and down
the coast seems a mere incident amid all
this gaiety.

“Feng-Stiui” : The decision to man the
Singapore Base exclusively with white
troops comes on the tenth anniversary of
the Singapore Mutiny. That upheaval
scarcely made itself heard above the larger
uproar in 1915. but the white inhabitants
of hundreds of British outposts all over the
world slept less easily because of. it. A
regiment of Punjaubis. informed by interned
Mermans that the British Empire had col-
lapsed and the hour for the holy war had
struck, took service rifles in their hands, and
for some hours had the whole white com-
munity on the run. Most of the women
and children were removed to vessels an-
chored in the harbor, and one crowd of re-
fugees got an involuntary trip to Port Darwin
when the ship they were on was suddenly
ordered away on a cable-repairing job. The
usual prompt materialisation of a fleet of
Allied warships prevented a massacre, but
for days scattered bands of well-armed muti-
neers. were being hunted by volunteers and
blue-jackets through the thick jungle in the
interior of the island. The execution of 17
ringleaders under the silent gaze of thou-
sands of Asiatics of every race ended the
proceedings. Amongst those killed—he lost
his life in an attempt to save his wife from
being riddled with Punjaubi bullets —was
George Wald, a S. Australian, and a mathe-
matical genius of incalculable promise, who
at the age of 28 had talked fourth dimension
with Oliver Heaviside on equal terms. Two
other victims were H. Woolcombe and his
wife, of Nelson (M.L.). It is. this affair
and the growing unrest in India that has
decided the Admiralty not to trust the de-
fence of Singapore again to Asiatics.

POLITICAL
POINTS
As far as the British Empire is concerned,
the Geneva Protocol is as dead as the Solemn
League and Covenant. Austen Chamberlain
formally rejected the .thing last week on
behalf of his Government, remarking that
Australia, M.L., Canada, S’Africa and India
were against it. This statement has been
disputed, as regards Australia, by Clumsy
Macdonald, apparently on the authority
of Matthew Charlton. The theory is that
Matthew mistook the echoes of his verbosity
(he is the only out-and-out Protocol man in
the Commonwealth) for the voice of the
people.
The tormented soul of Sun Yat-Sen having
departed to the Yellow Springs, the Chinese
Government, which fought him all his life,
has bestowed posthumous titles on him and
accused Heaven of an unmerciful act in
depriving the Republic of his services. As
he was on the point of instituting Bolshevism
in China when he died, this may be taken
as the usual polite expression of a vast relief.
Heaven, however, may regret its precipitancy.
Queensland Premier Gillies tried to justify
the malodorous Brennan affair by alleging
that “a very great number of appointees to
the Australian Bench have been anti-Labor
politicians, many of them violent partisans,”
whereas not one Labor Parliamentarian had
reached the Bench. It would be a squalid
argument even if Gillies could cite specific
cases of Judges who got their jobs because
they were tenpence party politicians and
twopence lawyers, and he was careful not
to go into particulars. Anyway, his facts
are wrong. One N.S.W. Judge, the choice of
a Labor Government, was a Labor Minister
for two years; and Justice Higgins, though
never a pledge-and-caucus man. was
Attorney-General in a Labor Ministry before
he was raised to the High Court. Certainly
Higgins was a leader of the Equity Bar
and an authority on constitutional law,
whereas Brennan was merely the man who
was under the tree when the fruit was
dropping.
In Queensland last year there was a lot
of silly Labor chatter about cutting refer-
ences to the A.I.F. out of Government school
literature. Now it is proposed by the West-
ralian Labor Government to prohibit the
customary addresses to the children in the
State schools on Anzac Day. There are not
many Westralian youngsters who hadn’t a
father, a brother, an uncle or a cousin in the
Peninsula. To pretend that the few or the
many are in danger of becoming “militarised
by being told once a year what those fathers,
brothers, uncles and cousins did or helped to
do is a peculiarly hoggish sort of imbecility.
Labor is ill served by clumsy men of peace
who rush into boorish outrages on public
sentiment.
Now that the Reds of Vic. Farmers’
Uni oh have been sufficiently licked to enable
the State Ministry to continue in office,
Allan, Peacock and co. will begin on March
23 to frame a programme for next session.
Rural bank, maternity wards, gas control,
city bridges and high schools,_ road-buildmg
and maintenance, redistribution of seats,
training and classification of mental defi-
cients, apprenticeship regulation, secret
ballot of industrialists before a strike, and
amendments of the Police Offences and
Crimes Acts will be some of the planks. Ihe
session will not open till July.
The Regional Plan Convention, which pro-
posed to make Sydney a fit place for patriots
to live in, has confessed its failure to achieve
anything, and incidentally has passed an
unspoken criticism on the One Bloated City
fetich. If N. S. Wales had a number of
cities competing for its trade, the inefficient,
congested and ramshackle ones would lose
business, and the well-planned ones would
attract it. The town-planner would then
be recognised as an indispensable official.
Sydney can afford to give an expensive and
poor service to the State because there
are no other cities handy to challenge her.
Speaking in the House of Commons on
the Trade Union Political Levy Bill, Prime
Minister Baldwin said it was unjust that a
man, being in a union by compulsion in
order to have a chance of work, should have
“SOS!"
“Alarmed at the Government’s threat to disperse the Commonwealth steamers, the Seamen’s Union
has promised to honorably observe agreements in the future if the deal is called off.”
THE SQUEALER: " Save me, somebody—save me, quick! I’ll even drown me cobber if
somebody'll only save me!”
to subscribe to the election fund of the local
Labor candidate, whom he might heartily
detest, or else be thrown out. AVhen it was
a choice between contributing to the party-
machine candidate or hunger, Baldwin ad-
mitted that Freedom was a twisted institu-
tion. At the same time he opfposed the bill
because lie didn’t want to “piSsh a political
advantage” or to ‘‘fire the first shot.” ‘‘Give
peace in our time, O Lord,” he said in an
agitated whisper, and fell dramatically into
his seat. The supplication may sound pious,
but it is selfish and mean. A prominent
agnostic is credited with a more manly senti-
ment. : “If evil must come, I hope it will
be in my time and not in that of my
children.”
From the reporters’ table :
Never had Melbourne Temperance Hall housed a
more intemperate throng than the 350 delegates to the
Cocky Conference. W, J. McCann, the chairman,
would have been a lot less uncomfortable had he
mislaid his acousticon. The acousticon suggested
Hughes—it was the only thing about the chairman
that did —but it is questionable if even
Hughes at his zenith could have disciplined
that crowd. Hill and Gibson, Commonwealth
Ministers, achieved a Pyrrhic victory over P. G.
Stewart regarding the Bruce-Page pact, but Stewart
reckons Ik n il's are even, because the bargain is
bounded by next election. Premier Allan, however,
had an unquestionable win, and it was a very proud
Farmer John who bowed to his cheering supporters
when a motion denunciatory of the State Composite
Ministry was knocked out by 36 votes. But what a
pandemonium accompanied the taking of divisions!
What taunts, what displays of animosity! That such
an organisation should be called a Farmers’ Union
is as humorous, after a fashion, as the official state-
ment that the fall in membership from 19,000 in
1922 to 8000 in 1924 was due to the subscription
being raised ten bob a year.
Holman, Iv.C., who lias appeared at great
length to “assist” the N.S.W. New States
Commission, was reported in Sydney Tele-
graph (13/3/’25) :
Mr. Holman submitted that history had no record
of a movement towards subdivision of a State. The
supposed benefits of homogeneity, localised effort and
proximity to the seat of government were all illusory,
and equally so were the supposed economical advant-
ages of increasing secondary industries, hydro-electric
generation, and growth in numbers.
I-lolman himself keeps fairly approximate
to the seat of government; he was at Wya-
long once, but soon thought better of that.
But, anyhow, there is mental refreshment
in meeting a man who sees no good in second-
ary industries or in cheap electric power,
who has no use for increased population
even in the thinly-peopled outskirts of a big
State, and who never heard of “a movement
towards subdivision of a State.” Rehoboam
heard of it a long while ago, and the idea
kept cropping up in all manner of places,
including empires and vice-royalties, till it
even cropped up in the original State of
Botany Bay. For that matter, if there is
no record of a State subdivision movement,
what is the movement that Judge Cohen is
on now? In the U.S. New York State was
subdivided once. Massachusetts once, North
Carolina once, Louisiana at least once, Vir-
ginia twice and Georgia twice. But perhaps
Holman wouldn’t call these movements.
Ni S. Wales Premier Fuller has been talk-
ing again about his untiring efforts in the
cause of decentralisation. Among the other
efforts of his Government: —
It has taken a number of important preliminary
steps towards a more widespread and effective move-
ment. It has sought to set up a greater and more
practical community of interests among the people
and country centres. Local bodies have been given
the opportunity for a greater exercise ot their
initiative and enterprise.
And there was much more about the Min-
istry’s labors in shovelling rainbows and
carrying around boiled ice in sieves. But it
didn’t appear that a line lias been built,
however short and cheap, to. give access to
any outport; or that any railway rate has
been re-adjusted to give a preference to the
smaller towns, in order to make up for
many years of discouragement; or that the
shifting of population and factories to the
city has diminished: or—or, in fact, that
anything at all is perceptibly altered.
Cleland, K.C., Hannan, Parliamentary
draftsman, and Denny, the lawyer Minister
of Housing, all helped in compounding the
statement issued by S. Aus. Premier Gunn
regarding the stoppage of work on Adelaide’s
thousand-homes scheme. And then the docu-
ment, which referred to “vital delays” and
placed the responsibility on contractor
Timms, left people wondering. Former Labor
Premier Verran, now tally clerk for Timms,
told the men before they were paid off that
it was a case of “financial difficulty.” Yet
Timms’s son affirms that “there is no finan-
cial trouble, as will be seen later.” Mean-
time prospective owners of houses are won-
dering where they will find shelter for the
winter.
The N.S.W. branch of the Australian
Clerical Association, which was the means
of bringing to light one of the famous A.L.P.
ballot-boxes with sliding panels, had an
election the other day with the now familiar
trimmings. The returning-officer reports that
of 773 ballot-papers returned to him (1000
had been issued) 408 were forgeries:—-
An addressed envelope accompanied each ballot-
paper posted to the member, but quite a number of
papers were returned in plain envelopes, some con-
taining as many as 12. Envelopes were also received
bearing the State Parliamentary seal; in some cases
these contained as many as six ballot-papers. On
examination of the papers received in this manner
a high percentage proved to be forgeries, and a
number of forgeries were also received singly. On
a number of papers received in one envelope my
initials had been forged. I then interviewed the
printers.. . .After examination they had no hesita-
tion in pronouncing that 408 of the ballot-papers,
although they bear the imprint of the Worker press,
had not been printed there, and were consequently
spurious.
Yet the “Nationalist” Government is quite
satisfied that the gentry who forge ballot-
papers, fake ballot-boxes and impersonate
unionists and A.L.P. branch members are
incapable of playing similar pranks on their
opponents at general elections. At least no
precautionary measures are proposed.
The mercantile marine of the Northern
Territory consists of the John Alee (80
tons) and the Huddersfield (one knot). The
two craft have been given the sack as little
or no good. As a newspaper report put it
after the rupture of relations: —
Cabinet, without delay, will consider the question
of calling for tenders for a new service. There is,
however, no need of immediate action, as during
the rainy season, now on, coastal communication
is suspended.
But births and marriages and deaths and
accidents and wrecks and wars happen even
in the rainy season, especially if Fate has
come out without its umbrella, and it is well
for this great continental Government to have
at least an official skiff ready for sea on the
1040 miles of N. Territory coast. But it
always reckons there is no need of imme-
diate action in the N.T. ; in fact, haste. is
only called for in fixing up a reciprocity
treaty with sharp men in Canada.
From the lobbies :
It will not be surprising if the Federal Parliament
takes over some of the furniture and fittings used
either in the Spring-street edifice, Melbourne,
which it now occupies, or in the temporary State
Houses at the Exhibition Building, for the Canberra
caboose. The Speakers and Presidents of both
legislatures have had a preliminary look at the
trappings with a view to bargaining. Possibly a
selection will be made from both establishments.
Vic. Parliament will, seemingly, go back to its old
home next year, and it does not want two sets of
expensive furnishings. There will be no lamentations
in Melbourne (except perhaps in the five daily-paper
offices) at the departure of the 111 Federal lawmakers.
Vic. Parliament thinks that its status will be raised
when its rival goes north.
There are 81 United States District Courts,
and one of them has made history. It has
decided that the seizure of a Dutch drink-
boat, valued at 200,000 dollars, was legal
though Mynheer van Schnapps was five
leagues off shore, which was 12 miles beyond
the old three-mile limit of jurisdiction, and
three miles beyond the present 12-mile limit.
The ruling is that liquor heading for Uncle
Sam’s prohibited country can be seized any-
where on the high seas. This seems to con-
tain the germ of a row, especially if all
drink moving in a north-easterly direction
across the Pacific is interpreted as being
bound for the U.S.
SHIPS AND KINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The was to have left at noon with passengers
and cargo, but at sailing time it was found that a
fireman was missing. After waiting, etc
It was a grey and ancient man
And ripe and rank seemed he;
The senile tears unending ran
A-down his drapery.
He walked the wharf with steady tramp
That hid a trembling knee,
And moistly as a misted lamp
His red eye gleamed at me.
Then, solemn as a bygone seer,
His nodding head shook he,
And wafted on a breath of beer
His words came wearily.
“Alas!” quoth he, “the day is done;
The dwindling sands run free,
And wealth ana worth and glory won
Mean little now to me.
“But I have known as few may know
The careless mastery
Of man and matter, weal and woe,
And time’s eternity.
For at my will Fate’s mighty wheel
Might spin or cease, you see;
And at my whim ten hundred kneel
For ‘aye’ or ‘no’ from me.
“For this might kings come, cap in hand,
And uncontented be,
For power the like have none on land
And very few at sea.
’Twas even such a mammoth ship
That waited by the quay ;
That waited” —wet his quiv’ring lip—
“ That waited but... .0n... .me.”
“Then who are you, you grey old man?”
So weak and poor seemed he,
And mignty as a mountain’s span
That vessel’s majesty.
“All wealth could not of this boat’s time
A moment hold in fee ;
So, who the devil are you?” “I’m
A fireman, son,” said lie.

for a command, let me settle all bets regard-
ing the port of registry of infants launched
at sea. As soon as the youngster has raised
its plaintive squeal on a British ship, the
fact is entered in the vessel’s official log, to-
gether with the particulars regarding parent-
age required ashore. A copy of the joyous
entries is then made on a form known as
the B. and D. 1 paper, and this duplicate is
handed in to the Shipping Master or British
Consular or Colonial Officer at the first port
touched at. for transmission to the Kegistrar-
General of Shipping and Seamen at Tower
Hill (Bond.). Having been noted by that
gentleman, it is sent to Somerset House
(Bond.), and a copy can be obtained from
there if desired. As Somerset House is in
the parish of Kensington, the child will find
that its home-port is not tainted by the Bast
End stigma of Stepney. If an Australian

the local authorities send their °wn form

case a copy could be secured from them, but
that would not alter the fact that officially

On this subject the Board of Trade, states .
“Masters are reminded that they have no

mony is performed by them the marriage

“Acagey” • It was an affiliation case. Plain-
tiff said that, after giving defendant the glad
eve, as she thought he was a boy she knew,
he invited her to the pictures. At half-time
they left. In cross-examination the lady was
asked • “Do you mean to say that you per-
mitted intimacy on the first occasion on
which you met this man?” ‘Yes, I did,
was the reply, “but not without an argu-
ment.” *

“Woorook”: Casual bridegrooms? In the
early days of Dundas mining field (Tas.)
parsons were few and far between. But the
lady in the case was insistent on some sort
of ‘ceremony, so her soul-mate had to
acquiesce. “Righto! Next time a parson
lobs along you get hold of him.” The parson
chanced to “lob” when the prospective groom
was on day-shift, so the lady hauled him
along to the cathedral pile of the poppet-legs
just on crib-time. A message was sent below
and the casual one came aloft, nursing lus
lunch. He continued to devour it through-
out the ceremony; when proceedings were
concluded lie addressed the bride. “Righto!
See you later.” Then he stepped into the
cage and sank into temporary oblivion.

“Kowsara”: At Townsville (Q.) Licensing
Court the other morning 30 thirsty citizens
had to pay £5 3s. Gd. per head for being found
on licensed premises on the Sabbath. Only
one waxed indignant over the penalty. He
was Scotch, and his grievance was that he
had not been allowed to finish off his drink.

“Miro”: The domestic affairs of Elijah,
our old ferryman, have been disturbing the
district for weeks. After a bachelor life
of GS years Elijah decided to plunge into
matrimony; but he did nothing rashly. With
a foresight well in accord with mature years
he had a succession of ladies
sent up on trial from a city
marriage bureau, and pas-
sengers as they crossed in
the ferry were regaled with
his experiences. “None of
them has been suitable yet,”
Elijah told us with decision.
“The first was no kind of a
cook, so I sent her packin’;
and the next one had no
manners. Another wanted
to bring'her children, so she
went; and the next threw
tlie clock at me when I asked
her to get a bucket o’ water
from the river. There’s an-
other come up to-day, but I
don't like her looks. She
ain’t stayin’.” That after-
noon the parson rode down
to protest against the odor
of scandal that was becom-
ing associated with the ferry,
and that may have influenced
Elijah’s decision. Anyhow,
next time I hurried aboard
I heard a shrill voice yell-
ing: “Elijah, before you go
fetch me a bucket o’ water!
D’ye ’ear me? And then go
up to the store and get some
tea!” “This one staying?”
I asked, as we started off.
“Seems like it,” said Elijah
gloomily. “And she’s easy
the worst of the lot of ’em.
I mighter saved meself the
trouble o’ choosin’. She just says she won t

“Feng-Shui”: The latest proposal of the
guardians of Australian morals is to substi-
tute solo dancing for the double arrange-
ment now in vogue. Dancing apart is not
anew idea. It is obligatory in most Mo-
hammedan countries —in those lands where
women gcf veiled and have a status below
the beasts; where men are encouraged to be
libertines at home, and private debauchery
goes hand in hand with public decorum.
Amongst those races that Mohammed stifled
with his deadly creed, no woman who valued
her reputation would be seen dancing in
public; her place is taken by professional
dancers, usually prostitutes, who revolve
slowly round and round while their partners
take their turns in gyrating with them, but
never offering them the insult of a touch.
Here, then, should be the ideal measure;
but actually it is more voluptuous than any
European dance. Behind the mask of rice-
powder on the danseuse s face her eyes gleam
hotly, there is insidious appeal in the
stealthy movements of her limbs; the man
prances like a gamecock or writhes and ges-
ticulates with every refinement of obscene
allusion —and there is usually only one end-

ing to the significant performance. It is
curious that this method should be advo-
cated at a time when the most somnolent
step that has ever been invented is in popu-
lar favor. A glance at the gloomy faces and
dragging feet of a roomful of jazzers,
promenading to the maudlin rhythm of the
Blues, will convince any unprejudiced ob-
server that the old-time waltz was aphrodisiac
by comparison. # ,
“Bart” : It is stated that the Gyro Filpt,
automatic steerer, with which the motoi ship
Aorangi is fitted, has given wonderful re-
sults, the vessel’s wake even in rough weather
having been practically a straight line.
A straight tip that, beyond dispute.
Nothing could well be clearer.
When next I go upon the scoot,
I’ll wear a Gyro Steerer.

“Red Lamp” : Fate has been playing queer
tricks in Melbourne. A child, running across
Fitzroy-street, St. Kilda, was knocked down
and killed by a motor-car on Friday; early
the next morning a 17-year-old boy named
Bent was found shot at Lilydale. Ihe child-
ren were cousins. An elderly woman slipped
at a stairhead and, crashing down, broke her
neck. The shock to her daughter, who wit-
nessed the fall, brought on the premature
birth of her child; and both mother and
infant died. Urgently called to the bedside
where birth and death were both occurring,
the husband picked up his eldest son on the
way, and whilst racing out in his car met
with an accident, the son being killed. An
elderly woman had just received the news
of the death of her married daughter in a
country town, when another telegram arrived
that her son had met with an accident and
was not expected to live. She dropped dead
of heart failure, and, as I write, her aged
husband lies in hospital suffering from shock,
and making a feeble fight with Death.
“Machete” : A witness told a Sydney police
court the other day that included in some
money she had given a man to put on a
horse was a ten-shilling note bearing the
pious inscription “God Send You Back to
Me” Which recalls that one rarely sees
a banknote bearing an aspiration of this
sort nowadays ; a generation ago they were
common. Probably the Commonwealth Bank
destroys notes when they return bearing
such irrelevant adornments. The old private
bank issues enjoyed a longer run, even though
some of the endorsements were of the kind
one usually sees on the walls of secluded
retreats. A Brisbane bank teller had. a
book in which he used to copy note inscrip-
tions which he deemed worth preserving.
The neatest of the publishable ones was
line from Kipling’s “Song of the Cities :
“Last, loneliest, loveliest.”

“Sixenate”: In the days before the Wages
Board was born numbers of people from
cheap-wage countries made fortunes by ex-
ploiting unsophisticated relations whom they
brought to Australia. Sydney had a German
hand whose members received merely cheap
hoard and pocket-money. A now wealthy
Melbourne merchant used to meet his Rus-
sian compatriots at the boat and bind them
down to hawk his goods for ss. per week and
the poorest board and lodging; and sweating
in the Greek and Italian palaces of da oyst’
and da banan 1 was common. Apparently
some of it still goes on. A Greek who was
brought here last May by his brother and
set to work in the latter’s shop has just
given a Melbourne court some particulars
of the Hellenic brand of brotherly love. The
newchum rose at 5 a.in. and worked till 11
p.m., and had no holidays; and all the wages
he received in eight months amounted to a
little over £5O. Then some nark told him
about the Wages Board award, and worked
it out that kind brother owed him -
wages and overtime. The sweater was fined
for evasion of the award; but his worst
trouble is yet to come. Claims for over £5OO
are out against him for the back wages ot
his brother and others —one of them a niece
he had brought from Greece in the same
philanthropic spirit. Her little claim is for
£IS9. She didn’t know there was so much
money in the world.

“Centurion”: According to a copy of the
Gazette de Biarritz which came to me
the other day, Abdel Krim, the successful
leader of the insurgent Riffs m Morocco,
has evolved an economical plan of war pen-
sions. It boils down to this. All Riff bache-
lors have been expressly instructed to marry

“Do you believe in mixed marriages?"
“Good gracious, no! Why, my husband would
be shocked if I even thought of such
a thing!”
one or more war widows, and married Riffs
are asked to take at least one of these be-
reaved ladies on the staff of their present
establishments. From which it is clear that
not all the bitter aftermath of war has been
the Spaniard’s portion.

ANOTHER DISTRESSING CASE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“His Honor, who showed some emotion, said that
he thought the accused was too good for gaol.
Although it was a clear case, he would extend me
provisions of the First Offenders’ Act.”
The Justice and the bigamist
Were sighing face to face;
“Your Honor,” cried the bigamist,
“Just think of the disgrace!”
“I do, indeed,” His Honor sobbed;
“This is a painful case.
“If I award you seven years,
As on the facts I should,
Do you suppose,” the Justice said,
“That it would do you good?”
“I doubt it,” sighed the bigamist;
“I feel that I should, brood.”
“A flogging, then, and four years’ ‘hard,
As an alternative?” —
The Justice queried tenderly—
“ That sentence I might give.”
“I hope not!” cried the bigamist;
“I’m sure I should not live!
“Your Honor, don’t mistake my case;
I am not steeped in vice;
And when a boy at Sunday-school
The teachers thought me nice;
And, after all, what did I do?
Just merely married twice.
“I trust,” resumed the bigamist,
“Your Honor’s wit contrives
Some exit out of this impasse)
It may affect our lives.
And please consider that I have
Three mothers and two wives!”
His Honor here broke down, and wept;
And tears began to flow
From counsel’s eyes ; while all in Corn t
Became convulsed with woe;
And Sergeant Scroggs unlocked the dock
And let the blighter go!

“Sixenate” : The yarn is told that one of
the men hit by the recent decision of Mel-
bourne magistrates to send drunken motor-
ists to gaol managed to escape the penalty.
When he awoke the morning after to a real-
isation that he was in for it, he recalled
a cousin who bears a remarkable physical
resemblance to him. This impecunious scamp
had hitherto been regarded as a nuisance,
but he proved useful when for a considera-
tion he answered his cousin’s name in court,
and duly “went in” for the allotted term.
The real drunk, who reckons his time worth
large figures, considered, altogether apart
from personal convenience, that it paid him
to hire his cousin, even at fancy rates, to
serve his sentence; and the cousin was well
satisfied.

“M.G.”: There are several extraordinary
features about Maoriland’s epidemic of in-
fantile paralysis besides the fact that it
attacks fair-haired, well-nourished children
from the well-to-do homes of Oriental Bay
rather than the crowded slums of hungry
Newtown, and that except for one case it has

of noisome swamps. Christchurch (South
Island) reports that its bees have adopted
the go-slow policy, and the Government
apiarist says that it is due to a form of
paralysis which, although it is not directly
connected with the human pestilence, may be
produced by particular conditions that favor
both outbreaks. To add to the puzzle, at
Auckland (North Island) paralysis has seized
the hind legs of calves, causing death within
24 hours. One farmer has lost ten animals.

“I’d love to, but I forget what we quarrelled about.”
“Billy See”: The boss lumper was in
reminiscent mood. “The things a man sees
through the port-holes of a big liner !” he said
reflectively. “People get so used to being
at sea that they never think of the coal-
hulk lying alongside at night. They just
rush into their berth and switch on the light.
Of course a man shouldn’t look, but his eyes
will wander. The best joke we ever had
was the work of a stewardess on an Orient
liner. She had the lights on and the port-
hole open. She had about half stripped, and
work was slackening a bit as the nearest
lumpers watched developments. Then she
came to the port. ‘Good night, Coalies,’
she said as she switched off.”

“Bouragi”: What “X2X” styles a new,
and suggests is an improved, method
of hanging (B. 19/2/’25)
—the mode whereby the
patient is jerked up-
wards instead of being
dropped down—has been ex-
perimented with in places as
far apart as Papua and the
Klondike, where the N.-W.
Mounted Police employed it
with most satisfactory re-
sults. It was an ex-Ivlon-
diker who recommended its
adoption in Papua, but it
never got beyond the experi-
mental stage there. The
person to be operated on
stands on the ground, being
spared thereby the misery of
a door opening suddenly
under his expectant feet. On
a beam or bough overhead is
a heavy weight to which one
end of the rope is attached,
the other of course being
round the leading man’s
neck. Pushing the weight
off the beam jerks the con-
demned upwards with the
necessary velocity. The
N.-W. M.P. were in the habit
of using a 2001 b. bag of flour
as a weight, and though
there was one decapitation,
the idea worked admirably
when they got the hang of it.
so to speak. In Papua we
experimented with several
601 b. bags of rice, having no
flour. Unhappily, one of
these fell off the beam dur-
ing the trials and landed on C. A. W. Monck-
ton, who was taking an interest in the ex-
periment, and the matter was hastily
adjourned sine die. Which in the Papua of
those days was always translated “to the
pub.”
“Uramao”: In an Otago (M.L.) township
there was a Mayor who on visiting the city
invariably went on the rampage and over-
stayed his leave. On one occasion his bout
was so prolonged that fellow-aldermen
thought some public censure was merited,
and down it went in the minutes. At the
next pieeting the Mayor cast an eye over
the record. “Who proposed this motion in
the minutes?” he demanded. A councillor
stood up and owned up. The Mayor walked
round, and with a straight left floored him.
“Who seconded this motion?” he bellowed.
After a prolonged silence his Worship
finished with : “The motion, not having been
seconded, is informal,” so it was expunged.
“Envee”: I know at least one man who
squared liis account with the Anzac Provost
Corps. It happened at Sutton V'eny, where
a young lieutenant
with the Dental Corps
had just been pro-
moted from rank of
staff-sergeant. One
morning a batch of
Anzac Jacks were
paraded for dental in-
spection. The new-
made “loot” seemed to
take a particular in-
terest in one of the
war - winners, and
singling him out
piloted him into the
chair and carefully
examined his mouth.
Then he briskly an-
nounced that four
tusks needed extract-
ing. The next minute
the air was thick with
gurgles and groans,
while the wrenching
forceps did their work.
The patient was out-
side rinsing his mouth
when the tusk-extrac-
tor, wiping his hands,
cheerfully remarked:
“And that’s that!”
On inquiry he in-
formed me that the
teeth were as sound
as a bell, but “the
blankety-blank lugged
me off to Warwick-
square clink one night
in my non-com. days,
just because I was a day overdue from leave.
“And,” he chuckled, “there was no cocaine
in that blanky needle either.”

“Ex-Dig.”; The latest in juvenile war
heroes is a new arrival in Australia who
claims that he became a soldier at 14 by
bluffing the recruiting officers about his age,
and that after gaining
several medals in France, he
saw some sharp service in
Russia. His two brothers
and his sister, who, being
older, had got away to the
war ahead of him—-the last
as a nurse—all lost their
lives, and when he got back
to Canada he found his
parents had both died. It’s
a big heap of tragedies to
swallow. But anyway, John
Llewellyn P'ugh was a
younger soldier —he was in
the line at 13. He turned
up in Egypt # as a stowaway
on a transport, and was
adopted as a mascot by some
of the A.I.F. In France he
was put with the A.S.C., but
got away and joined an in-
fantry battalion. He was
never officially an Australian
soldier, and was supposed to
keep •out of action, but
didn’t. He was making a
living with a boxing show a
couple of years ago. I never
met him until after the war.
The youngest soldier I per-
sonally knew in France was
a boy named Baker, who,
although but 15, was well
grown enough to dodge the regulation, made
in 1917, that Diggers under the age of IS
should be kept in camp in England to mature.
He was killed after being in France a few
weeks.

From a wandering Australian: —
One of the strangest manifestations of the Church
Militant is thrust on the traveller arriving in the
city of Portland (Oregon) after dark. Towering
high above surrounding shop and office buildings in
the busy part of the city, an out-size in electric
signs flashes out an invitation. Underneath a gleam-
ing five-pointed star the word “Jesus” appears in
letters of fire—letters sft. high and of the most
intense crimson; and as the full message is flashed
on in white intermittently, the whole sky becomes
illuminated with the words “Meet Jesus Below.”
Later on I followed that star until I came to a
modern office building. On the street-level was an-
other sign “Meet Jesus Upstairs.” So up three
flights I toiled, finding myself eventually in a large
bare room holding perhaps 500 people in the throes
of a religious revival. Helped by a large orchestra,
a big negro headed the congregation in a fervid
rendering of passionate hymns. “We preach Christ!’’
shouted a tall, good-looking young man who appeared
to be prayer leader, orchestra leader and exhortcr-
ln-excelsis. Striding up and down the platform he
shouted above the tumult, and, as he finished, the
roomful of converts knelt and testified in a shouting
singing, happy throng that at least one church was
not dead and that modern methods produce results
even in religion.

“Wealsman”: The Hobart “black” beer
boycott, which lasted through a 12-days’
drought and looked like becoming a per-
manency among the waterside workers, seems
to have ended. At any rate, the drought
has ended, the landlord of the historic Ship
Hotel, a free house, having decided to break
away from his fellow-Bungs and hand out
the desired 12oz. beer for sixpence to all
comers. So many customers called to con-
gratulate the Ship’s captain that the gang-
ways became blocked and it took frequent
relays of hefty men to keep the pumps
going hard enough to avoid disaster. When
the mail left the L.Y.U. was understood to
be preparing a manifesto, in vermilion ink,
declaring the Ship black.

“Harold Hardupp”: The breeze has been
blowing banknotes in the Melbourne suburb
of Canterbury. A man was working in his
garden when he discovered a tenner affixed
to the prongs of his gardening-fork. He was
speculating where the precious paper came
from, when another note fluttered to his feet.
Then his thoughts went to an advertisement
which enabled him to demonstrate to a
neighboring householder that there is at
least one honest man in Melbourne. The
neighbor had made a safe deposit of his
chimney; and the draught, getting busy, had
sent the root of all evil into the air—it pro-
bably rested on the roof until a blowy day
sent it further. Another of the flimsies was
found by a boy in a hack yard; and one way
and another the man who was so carelessly
careful about his money got the whole lot
back.

“FY7”: What happy days in Roma a
wire from there recalls —Roma, in South-
Western Queensland, always owning the repu-
tation of being a hot shop, especially in the
days when it disputed with St. George the
honor of being Queensland’s cattle-duffing
metropolis! Just before a recent heat-wave
someone put a pie-disli full of eggs (whether
liens’, emus’ or snakes’ is not stated) on
a Roma pantry-shelf, and there it stayed,
forgotten, for a couple of weeks. Then came

the heat-wave, and when the butler or some-
one entered the pantry the eggs had all
been hatched. The wire is maddeningly
silent as to what was hatched. But it
couldn’t have been jim-jams. They are far
too common in that part of the country to
wire about to the southern press.

“Keppel”: Queensland railway depart-
ment has put all its previous accomplish-
ments in the shade by losing a five-roomed
house. The structure was pulled down at
Mount Morgan, trucked and addressed to a
station near Mackay. Weeks passed, and
it failed to turn up at its destination; the
department, after a deal of correspondence,
finally admitted that it didn’t know where
on earth the darned thing had got to, but
professed to be doing its best to find traces
of it. Six weeks after its despatch, when
the bosses of the department were just going
grey, the house was found on the Darling
Downs, at a station past Toowoomba, about
700 miles from the place it was consigned to.
SWAT THAT FLY!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas Bavnabe Googe who, on a night
Now centuries gone by,
Saw flitting in the candlelight
A “simple, sely Fly.”
And full of pity for the pain
That wit inflicts on men,
He of her carelessness was fain
And wished she had his pen.
His terms paternal, void of rage,
And innocent of doubt,
Bespeak the easy-going age
Ere men and flies fell out.
Ere Science came with terrors weird
Man’s timid steps to dog;
When nerves were neither known nor fearer
And germs went round incog.
To us, too wise, the buzzing fly
No pleasant fancy brings ;
We see a wretch corrupt and sly, j
Contagion upon wings.
The fruit is eaten, Eden’s barred,
And ’gainst the yearning hope
A grim professor stands on guard
With flaming microscope.
Lambs shall lie down with lions yet,
The prophecies avow ;
And, faith, the stage is partly set—
The lion’s ready now 1
But not until in sweet relief
The Golden Age arrive
Shall lambs o’ercome their disbelief
And men make truce with flies.

the position that the question arises whether
the growth of beef for export is worth sen-
ous consideration in Australia. In the case
of the Q.N.P., sheep have saved the situa-
tion from being worse. Their value m the
books is £30,000 more than it was a year
ago, and £32,250 better than in 19-^; and
the improved value of the wool must have
represented a tidy proportion of the year s
profit. Here are livestock details: —
1920. 1921. 1923. 1924.
Cattle .. £492,228 £402,161 £383,918 £349,392

The Q.N.P. is related to the Q.N.B. When
the financial storms of the ’nineties had
passed, the Q.N. Bank ruefully surveyed the
heap of properties in its hands. There was
only one wise course: to dispose of what it
could and nurse the rest. Millaquin bugar,
a half-million proposition, provided an out-
let for the more important of the sugar lands,
and the pastoral properties were handed over
to the Q.N.P. This latter was floated m
1915; but, as in the case of Millaqum, the
Bank has not lost its interest—the presence
of Q.N.B. directors and the general manager
on the Board indicate that. In its first
six years the promise of the prospectus to
“pay and maintain a dividend giving a fair
rate of interest” was fulfilled; but since
then there has been a four-year drought for
ordinaries, and immediate prospects are not
promising. Nevertheless the balance-sheet
position is still comfortable: —

The co. owes sundry creditors (£26,693)
£3053 more than it did a year ago ; but
whereas it was leaning on the Bank tor
only £40,974 in 1923, last year the amount
was £101,924. However, the co. is m the
fortunate position of having a banker on
the premises, so to speak. Accepting the
book valuations there were net tangibles (in-
cluding leaseholds) for £863,823. on December
31, after providing for the dividend; this
was equal to £3 9s. per pref. share, or Dust
over 20s. for every £1 of capital. Ihe co.,
realising the limitations on the export of
beef (even the southern markets, with their
recent high prices, are not readily available,
distance being the bar), and aware of the
other factors mentioned, is seeking a way
out in sheepbreeding. Two stations Luck-
now and Cork —are in process of improve-
ment for sheep, and, although the operation
costs money—£Bo.ooo is to be spent -the
outlay, even if wool prices go back a few
points, should be justified. Meantime the
Board is continuing its policy of cutting
down cattle values; but whether the cut
has been sufficient is known only to those
inside. The composition of the Board is the
best guarantee in that matter.

Last year’s profits of Melbourne’s beer com-
bine should move the dullest Dry speaker to
flights of oratory—or send him to .the Stock
Exchange in quest of shares. Ihe Board
did its best before striking the net profit: it
provided for bad and doubtful debts, income-
taxes, maintenance and depreciation ot
property, machinery, etc., and doubtless
slipped in a little extra here and there to
make quite sure. Then it declared a div.
of 15 p.c. on all shares (the pref. minimum
is 7 p.c., but they share with the ords. point
for point above that figure), and sent
£106,1515 to reserves. It could have paid
20 p.c., but it had to draw the
line somewhere, even if reserves did
present a bloated appearance. Plainly
Carlton and United has perfected its
organisation. Formed in 1917, it took over
McCracken’s, the Carlton, the Victoria,
Castlemaine, Shamrock and Foster brewing
cos.. McCracken’s and the last three were
closed, the key which turned the lock being
a consideration of £2500 annually for 2o
years. In the introductory table that an-
nual £2500 fills the gap between appropria-
tions and the reserves total.
The Combine’s early years were not bril-
liant, although prefs. got their div. regularly
and even a little more on occasions, and
ordinaries, after a 4 p.c. in 1917, went from
point to point on the upward track. The
15 p.c. of the last two years has been a
simple matter, and profits could shrink
£lOO.OOO without necessitating a move from
that rate. In the past three terms £338,418
has been added to reserves, which now
amount to 69 p.c. of capital. A co. in that
position can stand a few bumps. _ Reserves
are, however, headed “Nominal” in the in-
troductory table because of the goodwill in
the purchase consideration. The item as it
appears in the sheet is: “Purchase considera-
tion (including goodwill, trade and business
connection of the vendor brewing com-
panies, trade names and marks, and right to
tied trade and option to purchase breweries
and other properties), £800,000.” Which is
mostly air. In the early accounts it over-
shadowed the whole balance-sheet ; but its
proportions are now, relatively, less bulky.
Balance-sheet figures have moved in this
1919. 1923. 1924.

The expansion of deposits moves one to re-
mark that building societies, which are doing
valuable social work, find it almost impos-
sible to obtain such funds.
• •••••
Victoria’s thirst is growing, if balance-
sheet movements are any test. An almost
50 p.c. expansion in book debts is the most
notable increase in the year, although hotel
freeholds went from £24,021 to £126,486.
These freeholds, as well as the brewery
property and plant, are in the books at much
under their real value, for there have been
in recent years extensive additions to brew-
ing property and plant, most of it charged
to revenue. Breweries, of course, need re-
serve strength, both visible and invisible. The
Trade has side-tracked the Cold Tea Army
for five years—the 1922 Act provided that a
State-wide vote on prohibition shall be held
once in eight years—but the cohorts will
probably put up the father of a scrap when
the gong goes. The present betting is all
in favor of the breweries so long as they
keep the trade free, from abuses.
Visible reserves are within £41,308 of the
composite goodwill item. The liquid position
is strong, there being cash backing for
£34.510 of deposits, with liquids and semi-
liquids amounting to £803,859 to account for
the balance (£68,013) and the £168,078
owing on open accounts. Judged by recent
experience the 15 p.c. div. can be paid with
the greatest of ease, and the fact that there
is practically no likelihood bf any further
competition in the field removes one disturb-
ing factor. In fact, the tendency is strongly
to the contrary, as Carlton and United has
within recent weeks absorbed some of the
larger of the country breweries. About the
only thing which need go between share-
holders and their sleep is a doubt as to when
the Board will decide upon a capitalisation
of reserves or an issue of new shares or
both. Incidentally there seems no reason why
the co. should delay making its balance-sheet
available until seven months after the close
of the accounts.

That table tells part of the story. With
£1462 live capital and £1827 forfeited, in
3906 the 10 p.c. div. was pleasant enough.
Then reserves, which had been piling up to
relatively huge dimensions, were capitalised
and assets written up on a reconstruction;
and in 1910 shareholders got a return lb
times greater than they had the year before.
Apparently some few things were overlooked,
and there was an issue of bonus shares next
year, so that in 1920, without having put
a penny more into the business, shareholders
got £8493 in dividends where two years be-
fore they had got £l46 —equal to 240 p.c.
on the old capital. At one time the show
was semi co-operative, but those days have
passed. Following the reconstruction the co.
branched out into refrigeration and cold-
storage, which necessitated an issue at par
of £15,000 ordinary capital in 1921. In
the two succeeding years big additions were
made to plant, and £30,000 in 8 p.c. prefs.
was offered in 1922. Last year, on the
29 600 which were taken up, £3935 was still
callable. Here is a comparison of balance-
sheet figures:— „

External liabilities at December 31 totalled
£74,096, of which £17,983 was sundry credi-
tors ■ and the total of liquids, including
stocks, was £33.952, less the div. Reserves
are all in the business. Keen competition
and price-cutting kept down profits during
the year, but the co. has such a splendid
organisation that it maintained its business
to the good effect shown. Not that the div.
is out of the ordinary—in fact, considering
the volume of reserves, it is on the small side
—but in consequence of the gift issues _ of
five or six years ago old holders are getting
a wonderful yield.

A slackening in the building boom plus the
growing popularity of concrete is reflected in
the year’s accounts. That the difference is
not greater is due to the other side of the
co.’s activities: tile and pottery making.
Still, eten the most optimistic of shareholders
can hardly have expected an encore of the
1923 div. rate, particularly in view of the
20 p.c. issue of bonus scrip that year. Not
that shareholders have received very much
for their money. Over the past 10 years the
div. has averaged only 7.8 p.c. p.a., notwith-
standing that substantial reseryes have been
helping capital. The transfer in. 1923 lifted
capital to £192,528, so that last years 12i
p.c. was worth 15 p.c. to all but recent
buyers of the scrip. But had the Board fore-
seen the development of the two factors* men-
tioned —slackening in construction and _ in-
creasing utilisation of concrete —it might
have held its hand.for a_ while.
Including the holes in the ground and the
other properties and assets at their book
valuation, there are net tangible assets of
245. 3d. for each £ of capital, and the posi-
tion is solid: —

Prospects for trade in the products handled
by the co., despite the adverse factors, are
respectable if not brilliant. Building activ-
ity may ease, but there still is plenty of work
in Melbourne suburbs, and slackening in the
city would affect concrete more than brick.
Further, the strong understanding in the
trade will prevent price-cutting, and the
steadily increasing cost of house-building
timber is a help.

The directors do a lot of regretting. In
five out of the past seven years they have had
to regret not being able to pay any div. to
ordinaries, and three extra regrets have been
thrown in for pref. holders. The co. has
been installing a system of water Humes by
which it is hoped to save £lO,OOO per annum.
One was built in 1923 and a main flume was
started last year and is still under construc-
tion. It is expected to be in operation before
the close of the current term. Meantime the
year’s loss is put down to trade conditions.
Needless to say the balance-sheet position
isn’t improving:—

The debenture debt is backed by assets in
the books at £272,006 and the balance has
to cover £16,683 of liabilities and the £66,315
of prefs. (Prefs., by the way, are non-cum.)
Just what is the real value of property and
plant is hard to say, but the chain of profit-
less years makes any figure an object ot sus-
picion. Certainly there is not much to repre-
sent the 262,940 10s. ordinaries when liabili-
ties and the prefs.—in all £135,794 have
been provided for. The Board places hope
in the water flume floating the co. on to a
profitable basis. If the anticipation is not
realised a few questions ought to be asked.
Has trade been bad? If so, why? The
quality of the coal is said to be good: why,
then, cannot markets be won? Is labor
exceptionally unreasonable? The . reports
don’t stress the point. That there is some-
thing wrong is plain. What it is should be
ascertained and the remedy applied. lor
even if the anticipated saving of £lO,OOO p.a.
is realised, it will not give ordinaries more
than a mere smell of a dividend unless there
is an improvement elsewhere. It can’t be
pleaded that earnings have been going m
improvements. Apparently all capital expen-
diture has been charged to capital, and
nothing was written off property account last
year notwithstanding that 109,554 tons ot
coal was taken from the mine.

The Accident Insurance of Australia,
Ttd issues an amended prospectus in Syd-
ney." Nomina? capital is £200,000 in 50,000
8 p.c. cum. prefs. of 10s. and <OO,OOO ordi
naries of 55., of which the prefs and half
the ordinaries are offered for subscription.
The co. proposes to specialise m accident
and sickness-insurance business; also, lite
and fire, marine and general if the directors
think fit. Accident business, however, is to
bo the co.’s best girl. “From the shareholders
viewpoint accident insurance is recognised
from a profit-bearing source, to be the ; most
lucrative form of insurance investment, the
prospectus says, and adds that this kind ot
insurance is practically in its infancy, and
the field is unlimited. The first statement
doubtless means that, of all branches of in-
surance, accident is the most profitable, it
is not, although it has proved a valuable side-
line Also, it is not in its infancy, and the
field is not unlimited. That class of life
which is most liable to accidents is m the
overwhelming majority of cases covered by
the Workers’ Compensation Acts of the vari-
ous States. And the competition from at
least 60 cos. at present handling accident
business would not make a new co. s position
easy The prospectus paints a picture to
help probable shareholders in making up
their minds: —
On perusing your daily papers, what do we find?
a ]i s t of accidents—and it has been proved tune
and again that not one person in every 500 injured
had been insured against accident. Then, again,
sickness conies to most of us so be prepared.
It is excellent advice. It is especially advis-
able to so select your investments that they
will give you no anxiety on your sick bed.
Judging by this very ill-presented prospectus,
the Wild Cat regretfully concludes that more
peace of mind could be found elsewhere than
in the Accident Insurance Co. of Australia.

In Timor Petroleum Co., Ltd., one recog-
nises an old venture in a new dress, before
the war some Victorian graziers, header! by
Arthur ,T. Staughton, of Terang, took a
prospecting party to look for petroleum on
the southern side of Portuguese Timor.
The co. was managed from Sydney
in those days, and cost its supporters about
£2O 000 hard cash. The promoters hold
about 4465 acres under licenses and in pros-
pecting blocks. The cost of converting the
prospecting areas into leases at Lisbon will
hr £3OOO. The vendors call themselves Timor
Petroleum Holdings, in which the moving
spirits seem to be Frederick Nomens, ot
Glenferrie (Vic.), and 11. C. Macfie, of
Martin-place, Sydney. Nomens is to get
10,000 fnlly-p.aid £1 shares and Timor Petro-
leum Holdings £lO.OOO cash and 50.000 fully-
paid £1 shares. Besides these payments a
concern called Timor Oil, Ltd., will get 2
p.c. royalty on all the crude oil produced,
while the Portuguese Government will take
-1 p.c. royalty. Timor Oil, Ltd., also has an
option over 10,000 shares at par for 12
months after oil has been struck. The direc-
tors may go to allotment when five shares
have been applied for at 10s. This makes
the allotment of the vendors’ shares a dead
certainty. There is a report from Dr. Wade
dated Oct., 1924. When his engagement
with the Government terminates he will
organise and commence operations and pick
the staff. His report deals cliieily with the
seepages he saw, and very little is said about
the anticlines away from the coast. The old
plant is to be used by the new adventurers,
who are not lacking in optimism: they ex-
pect to bring in oil for an outlay of £lO,OOO.

Great South Comet is a Melbourne float
to take over an old lead-zinc mine near
Zeehan (Tas.). Reports by A. M. Reid
(Tas. Govt. Geologist). T. 11. Palmer (B. H.
Junction North) and D. V. Allen agree that
over 70,000 tons of high-grade ore are avail-
able above present workings, Insuring at least
a four-years’ run on a treatment basis of
4i j tons weekly, and they figure on a weekly
profit of £528 with lead and spelter at £25
a ton—conservative figures, both. Palmer
recommends the erection of a plant costing
about £9OOO to treat 40 tons per shift ana
producing zinc concentrates, leadies and
leady-zinc middling. He thinks £lOOO should
open the mine and that £6OOO should be
available for general expenses. Another
£4OOO will be necessary, however, if the
anticipations of facilities and cheat) hydro-
electric power should go wrong. The lead
ore is reported by Palmer to assay 30 p.c.
lead. 20oz. silver and 12 p.c. lead, and the
zinc ore 10 p.c. lead, lOoz. silver and 30 p.c.
zinc. Reid’s figures are a shade low r er. Of
the capital of £35.000 in shares of 10s..
20.000 go to the vendors and nromoters and
40.000 are offered the public. While the new
mill is going tip it is proposed to set the
old plant at work and so take advantage of
high markets, thus relieving the contribs.
of calls. On present prices or anything like
them the proposition looks good.

F. T. Whimpney does well to keep the
Rose. Thistle and Shamrock shaft (Vic.)
moving on. The little hill claim cannot
count on any length of shoots, and therefore
any other policy would muck up the show.
Stoping has been going on at the 180 ft.
level south, where over an ounce was squeezed
out of every ton broken, so that a profit
was shown. The underlie shaft is carrying
good gold with it down to the next lift. The
story is that the lode has widened, and that
values are better. If these conditions con-
tinue in the level, the Rose, Thistle and
Shamrock again will be able to lift up a very
droopy head.

As a pup North Morning Star (Vic.) lived
because of the Morning Star alongside and
George Dickenson’s optimism. In cash
£8550 was put up to give it a start; £5220
lias gone in development, and £4200 in plant,
etc, so that trade creditors and the bank
have had to find some of the sustenance for
the show. As the co. has 20,700 shares for-
feited, the only chance to keep going is to
get in fresh blood, and Dickenson is the
right man for such a forlorn hope. lhe
dyke has been drilled, and it is because two
or three quartz floors have been proved which
should link up with the old-time famous
Hope workings that the job should go on. It
is a gamble, but so were A 1 and the Morning
Star.
« * * *
If John L. Wharton were alive and were
asked to tell why six months’ work down the
gutter in his old show, the Cock’s Pioneer,
had landed the co. in a loss of £7-08, he
would say that bores in drift often lie. That
lesson was learnt at Adelong and in tin
wash at a score of shows. When the upper
section of the lead was nearly worked out by
Cock’s Pioneer, systematic boring done on
the lower section proposed to be attacked
showed such favorable results as to astonish
old-timers. Hugh Falconer opened out 4500 ft.,
west of the old paddocks on a line of good
bores, but 442,000 cub. yds. of drift averaged
only 3.28 d. for gold and 1.55 d. for tin, which
isn’t good enough. Result, a loss of £7208.
Falconer’s argument is that he couldn t go
elsewhere in the face of the bore sampling,
nor could he change work in the new pad-
dock until he had seen how the usually reli-
able 70ft. run of gold shaped. It takes about
Bd. or 9d. a yard to pay under present-day
conditions. Now he is to cut up stream for
all he is worth so as to get to where “evi-
dence of the bores and previous work on the
lead suggest that values should be more
regular and of a payable nature.” The worst
feature of the position is that the banker
has his toe in the claim to the extent of
£17.252. Of course there are liquid assets
on the other side, but not to that amount.

“Fine Gold”: Westralian Chamber of
Mines has abandoned its opposition to a
gold bonus, and with other interested parties
is whooping for £1 an oz., 25 per cent,
of it being bait for the Bruce
was told when passing through Kalgoorlie
the other day that the £1 would result in
the opening up of many mines now idle,
prevent others closing down, increase pro-
duction and population, and perhaps be
the means of finding another “Golden Mile.”
The same tale with variations was told him
in Perth, and every member of both Federal
Houses is to be circularised to the same
effect. Later on they are to'be buttonholed
in Melbourne. So far every mining witness
that has appeared before the Federal Dis-
abilities Commission except Harry Gregory
has favored a bonus on gold, and every West-
ralian goldfields and metropolitan paper
except the West Australian is support-
ing it.

Westralia has had some curious mining
ventures, and one of the queerest is on a
white-gum flat on the eastern slope of the
Darling Ranges. A Scotch crowd interested
in a large area there is drilling regardless
of expense, but what for no one seems to
know. Gaunt gum-trees grow on the sur-
face, and the rock below is basalt.

A. E. Broue stands by Dr. Clapp:—
Commenting - on Dr. Clapp’s condemnation of the
area controlled by Freney Kimberley Petroleum Co.,
Chairman Nicholson is reported to have stated that
Dr. Clapp was never on the co.’s block. Dr. Clapp
was on block 84-H and cabled to me in Maoriland
that he did not believe anything of value would be
disclosed in Westralia. I had reached an agreement
with Freney Kimberley Co. for Dr. Clapp to examine
their block at a fee of 2500 guineas. Feeling that
I could not honorably take the fee from this co.
in the circumstances, I showed the cable to Mr.
Hamer, who is a director of Freney Kimberley Co.,
and he cabled his co. stating the fact. I have
refrained from entering into any controversy con-
cerning oil, but I think it is only fair to Dr. Clapp
and myself to say that it is my intention to issue
a statement shortly concerning my activities in con-
nection with oil in Australasia. Further, the February
issue of the Petroleum World, the recognised voice
of the petroleum industry, prints Dr. Clapp’s report
fully and is satisfied that his findings are correct.

Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) hopes to have its
Gladsome-Sand Queen mines at Comet Vale
drained in a few weeks, and to have opera-
tions in full swing a little later. As stated
by The Bulletin some time ago, these
shows produced a lot of gold, mostly from
above 400 ft., and were then flooded out. A
fair-sized shoot is said to be under water in
the bottom. To get at this Bullfinch raised
fresh capital and installed a pumping plant
to deal with a sea of brine. Now it is about
to search for ore which may not, as in the
case of the Sand Queen section of the pro-
perty, prove payable at depth.

Borneo Oil Option Syndicate hastens to
assure the “Wild Cat” that it is doing every-
thing possible to protect the interests of its
shareholders: —
We appreciate your statement (B. 26/2/’25) that the
Shell is keen to grab anything worth while, but so far it
has had no opportunity of acquiring the concessions
over which this co. holds the option. With regard to
jour suggestion that inquiry should be made as to
title, royalty, etc., the necessary action has already
been taken, and the directors are assured by high
legal authority in Java that the title is perfect. The
directors have been advised that the royalties payable
will not exceed those paid by the producing companies.
Further, the Commonwealth Government has been
given an opportunity of sending a capable geologist
to investigate the syndicate’s affairs in Borneo, and
it is the intention of the directors to request the
Westralian Government to make available one of its
geologists, at the expense of the syndicate, to in-
vestigate the concessions and confirm or otherwise
the report of Geologist Hogenraad.

In 10 years’ uphill fight South Aus. Oil
Wells Co. has spent £55,642, solely from
shareholders’ capital, without a £ of subsidy
or any kind of help from any Government.
Field-superintendent Dod’s contribution to
the annual report conveys the news that in
No. 1 bore at Caroline, just west of the
boundary between Victoria and South Aus.,
an oil sand 400 ft. thick has been proved.
The attempt to bring in the oil from this sand
has been arduous and difficult. Breakages,
replacements, wet weather, hard bands in the
strata of the bore, a broken core-barrel and
a fishing job, all were encountered and over-
come. The layers of upper water had to be
shut off and a powerful flow of gas made
the job harder. The strata have been corre-
lated with those met in the first bore at
Robe, GO miles north. The presence of
crude oil and natural gas in the bore is
now an established fact, and H. C. Dod
expects to bring in a wet gasser, one with
petrol in the gas, in the near future. The
possibility of the hole becoming a gusher is
mentioned optimistically. “Our chances of
success have never been so rosy,” says Dod.
A few facts of technical value are mentioned
in the report—the use of a double core-
barrel has proved satisfactory, and a Mans-
field magnetic oilfinder liis been usefully em-
ployed to survey an anticlinal fold. No. 2
bore has been spudded in with a percussion
plant and a light rotary plant with a mudding
system has been used at No. 1 borehole.

Mining in North Queensland has been
hampered during the past six weeks by
heavy rains, which have flooded mines and
impeded transport. This accounts for de-
creased returns lately, but fine weather will
unleash much new mining enterprise. _ The
Marvel tin-mine, Emuford (N.Q.), is one
of the chief sufferers at a very inopportune
time. Fred Reid, on behalf of the co., is
negotiating for a battery, and the Gurrum-
bah is under offer, but terms are too stiff.
The co. expects good returns from the ore
already at grass, and will probably pay a
dividend on it. When work stopped about
7ft. of medium- to high-grade ore was show-
ing in the bottom at a depth of about 40ft.
As the co. has several other strings in the
vicinity, the outlook is bright.
* * * *
There is a possibility of Mt. Garnet (N.Q.)
re-opening soon. The promise of the zinc
ores there has attracted the attention of
the Zinc Corporation. The mine was bailed
lately and a Z.C. official is sampling. Garnet
is regarded as a large potential supplier, but
other shows are being looked at as probable,
complementary sources. The N.Q. table-
land is rich in zinc, but it has hither-
to been regarded as a nuisance. Most of the
State mines around Cliillagoe are pretty rich
in the metal, but none of it is being saved.
State control will, however, keep this group
out of consideration if the Z.C. decides to
establish a separation plant in N.Q.
* * * *
A few feet of driving on the big lode in
the Great Northern, Herberton (N.Q.),
shows the ore hody to be thickening; at pro
sent it is 12ft. wide. All hands have been
put on tliis, but further sinking and driving
are necessary before it can be written up as
very big. Values are a shade lower and it will
probably not go over 2 p.c. However, the
stuff can be very cheaply mined and milled on
the spot. Since January 15 the mill has
treated only 150 tons, half from the mine and
the balance from the dumps. It yielded
2 tons 14cwt. tin concentrates. The mine is
capable of feeding the battery better than
this, and with a bit of push the old G.N.
may yet gladden the hearts of shareholders.
Nawng Pet (F.M.S.) needn’t apologise for
its February yield of 34 tons tin oxide
from 34,500 yards treated. A revenue of
£5500 from this bite of 221 b. ground is only
eaten into for £758 of working expenses,
leaving a mine profit of £4742. The return
from the other dollar concern, Rawang, con-
trasts unfavorably. Here the 14in. electric
plant ran through the whole of January and
February for 65 tons oxide from 140,000
yards, the first pound ground recorded. Work-
ing costs were £%200 and mine profit was
£(ilB3. Putting it another way, average
profit was £3091 a month for 2,000,000
dollar shares to divide, against £4742 for the
500,000 dollar shares in Nawng Pet.

The Misima Gold Mining Go., handling
the mine on which the old Block 10 Co. lav-
ished and lost so much, produced 2510 tons
for the four months Sept.-Dee., valued at
£3GO9. or £1 9s. 6d. per ton. Costs have
averaged about £l, but Dec. figures were
under 195., and manager Gilbert Wilkinson
expected January to be lower. Capital is
only £2950, so that the group who took over
the show are getting a good return. The
co. expects to pay its first dividend in April.
Some nice patches of ore are being opened
up, and it now looks as if the life of the
mine will be longer than had been estimated.
The most pleasing feature is the value being
recovered without reduction of ore.
Lucknow’s veins live and make their gold
in the diorite, the richest ore usually being
found as the serpentine is approached.
Already 40ft. has been driven, following No.
4 vein at the Pups, and the vein is still in the
diorite. A drive is also opening up another
section of the vein where an assay of 6oz.
per ton was obtained. Both drives are break-
ing stone called Lucknow seconds, which is
useless without rich stuff. The formation is
carrying some arsenical pyrites, whose
improving quality is indicated by latest
assays of 7oz. 7dwt. and Soz. 3dwt. gold per
ton. On any other field these assays would
make a mine, but the formations of Lucknow
are not long, continuous bodies, and would
scarcely pay to mill without rich ore of the
lOOoz. per ton type.

As forecasted last month, Carpathia
fN.S.W.) has declared a sixpenny—the first
since last October. But there is a very tidy
balance, and profit is working out just now
at about 3d. per month.

The long-standing uncertainty about a
new Agent-General for South Aus. has been
settled by the appointment of J. L. Price,
son of the State’s first Labor Premier, lie
is 42, but doesn’t look it. having kept an
alert, almost boyish manner, and many traces
of the debating society which first put him
on the road to politics. He has had a safe
seat for Port Adelaide since 1915, and wasn’t
even mentioned for the London job until the
other day.
Adelaide has lost James Marshall, one of
its business pioneers. Born in Scotland in
1844, he learned the drapery business in a
hard school, came to Australia GO years ago,
aud in 1879 went into business with Taylor,
Porter and Fry. The little Rundle-street
shop has since eaten up most of a whole
block, including the old Globe Hotel. He
never touched politics, but was on the gov-
erning bodies of a host of religious, philan-
thropic and sporting institutions. Most of
the present directors of the co. are sons of
the original firm. Like most similar Adel-
aide affairs, it has added manufacturing to
its importing business.
“See Bee” : Old hands among the 350 dele-
gates to the A.N.A. conference at Ballarat
recalled that the Golden City was the

Wainwright’s grave were in Ballarat the
lelegates would have made a pilgrimage to
it in gratitude for the way in which he sacri-
ficed himself for the A.N.A. So poor was
the association when it shifted its head office
to Melbourne 40-odd years ago that it could
only rent a single room on the seventh floor
of Prell’s buildings as an office and meeting-
room for the directorate. Now it has a suite
of rooms on the third floor, and there are
34,134 members, with funds totalling
£770.000.
One of Sydney’s most noted sportsmen,
Peter Moore, heard the last saddling-bell go
on Sunday at 70. His father was Patrick
Moore, and an uncle, also Patrick, settled
in 1812 on the land that became known as
Moorefields. Peter laid out a racecourse on
the old Moorefields farm in 1887 and owned
it until he disposed of it to the present racing
club, of which he was chairman for many
years. The A.J.C., Tattersall's, and the
Royal Agricultural Society also knew his
genial presence. He ran some good horses
of his own at one time and another.
On March 28 Alec Peacock, Treasurer and
Minister for Education, will have been 36
years a member of Vic. Assembly. From
1889 till 1904 his constituency was called
Clunes and Allandale, and since 1904 Allan-
dale. He has been in 14 of the 22 Govern-
ments that have ruled the country since
18S9, and his aggregate service as Premier,
Treasurer, Chief Secretary, Minister for
Labor and Education has been more than
20 years.
Burning oil now instead of coal, the

Roy Colvin, the first Bananalander to win
the M.C., has passed out in the Corinda
(Brisbane) Military Hospital, at 31. A
Rockhampton man, a jeweller by trade, he
was one of the first to enlist, and landed at
Gallipoli with the 9tli Batt. He served in
France with the 49th Batt., receiving a com-
mission for bravery at Pozieres, and being
mentioned in despatches many times. He
never properly recovered from his war
wounds, and since returning had been to one
sanitarium after another in search of health,
He leaves a widow and a year-old baby.
G. T. Clarke, who died last week at
Wollstonecraft (Sydney), aged 72, was a
bright light in local government and Odd-
fellowsliip for half a century. A Melburnian,
he hopped into municipal politics in M.L. in
his twenties, and when he came to Sydney
40 years ago he couldn’t shake off the habit.
It wasn’t long before North Sydney made
him Mayor. He was 10 years an alderman
also in the City Council, and wore the rabbit-
skin in 1912. In his lodge he collected all
the high-sounding titles, and represented
Australia at an international conference of
Oddfellows in America. He followed account-
ancy for a crust, was keenly and very use-
fully interested in friendly-society work—
he and J. B. Trivett and a few others drew
up the Friendly Societies Act of 1899 —
and did good service for the North Shore
Hospital.
In an “Aboriginalities” par. a few years
back “Wee Bobbie,” well known to Bulle-
tin readers, wrote of the impulse to kill that
even the most docile native gets at times,
and spoke of the risk a white man takes
when he walks in front of any native. Now
word comes from the Solomons of the brutal
murder of John Scott, manager of Inus Plan-
tation, Bougainville. He was last seen walk-
ing towards the plantation with one of his
copra-cutting boys, a large Buka native. He
did not return at night-time, and his worried
cook-boy found his master’s body at daylight,
horribly mutilated, in an isolated corner of
the plantation, his one arm (Scott had lost
the other) hacked through to the bone. His
head was split open by an axe, and the
body carried nine knife wounds. “Wee
Bobbie” and John Scott were the same man.
Besides his “Abo” contributions, he had
written a few yarns and sketches of very
considerable merit —one of them gained a
place in the last Christmas Bulletin.
William Burford, just dead in Adelaide,
was born in 1845 at the East Terrace fac-
tory where his father had just begun to make
soap and candles, previously imported from
Tasmania. In due time most of the work-
ing-up of the business fell on him. The old
place went up in a glorious blaze in ISSS,
and the new one in Wright-street in 1919.
Since then the smelly work has been done,
on a much larger scale, at Dry Creek. Bur-
ford was a deeply religious man, and did
good work on the Boards of the Y.M.C.A.
and Adelaide Hospital, as well as the
Chamber of Manufactures and Licensing
Bench.
E. A. Shrimpton, Maoriland’s chief engi-
neer of telegraphs, mended a faulty cable
between the South Island and the storm-
swept Stewart Island the other day, using
a local oyster cutter. The cost was £2OO
as against £2OOO if the Pacific Cable Board’s
repairing steamer had been chartered. An-
other feat of his was to ferry an overhead
cable across a swollen river by the simple
device he had seen the Maoris use to keep
their fishing-lines out against a stream.
Shrimpton is a practical man without the
practical man’s usual contempt for the
theorist; hence the Shaky Isles enjoy modern
telegraph equipment used efficiently. Their
service, on the whole, is laps ahead of what
Australia suffers meekly.
Thomas Coombe, father of the knighted
showman of the West, has died at Perth. He
settled in the Sunset State 34 years ago,
joining in the exodus from Broken Hill, and
became a member of the firm of Coombe,
Wood and Co., timber merchants. Later the
firm became merged in Millar’s Timber and
Trading Co. A cheerful old chap with a
neat, grey beard, he was active long after
lie had passed the allotted span, and could
be seen driving his own car up to a few
weeks before his death. Local charities will
miss him badly.
“The Deacon”: Towards the close of his
varied career, J. H. Smith, just dead at S 2,
was a victim of departmental redtape. An
outstanding candidate for a school’s inspec-
torship, he was duly recommended and ap-
pointed. By some blunder another Smith
was gazetted, a man with no pretensions for
the job; but the stiff-necked department re-
fused to admit the possibility of error, and
the other appointment stood. As a result
J. H. Smith—known to successive genera-
tions of boys in the Nepean district
as “Badger”—taught on at Penrith for 20
years prior to his retirement. Before he be-
came a teacher he had been in turn parson
and apothecary.
Charles Edward King, who put in the
last 40 years of his life at Bowral (N.S.W.),
was one of the relief party that went in
search of Sir John Franklin’s P'olar Expedi-
tion. He was within five of his century
when he crossed the bar.
Hayed his last gambit, at 78, James Joseph
Glynn, one of the oldest and best chess-
players in N. S. Wales. His reputation as
a composer of problems was world-wide, and
since his retirement from pedagogy he had
been the S. M. Herald’s chess expert.
A genuine Crimean veteran was Peter
Wedd. He gained the medal and bar of
Sebastopol in 1854, and when the wars
ended he took passage with his wife to Aus-
tralia in the windjammer Sarah Jane, a
leisurely lady who spent 12 months over it.
A further six weeks went in the attempt to
reach Iloskin Town, now Canberra (N.S.W.),
per bullock-waggon. After joining the
Little River gold rush, Wedd started mixed
farming at Durra Durra, and was still at
it when death took him at 96.
John Quinlan, “father” of Yea Shire
Council (Vic.), has served for half a cen-
tury on that body, and isn’t tired of it yet.
He has been president several times, and
always kept a cupboard.
Just died at Auckland (M.L.), James
Dickson Greig, aged 73. His last job was
manager of the Bank of Australasia in Auck-
land. He came from the National Bank of
Scotland in London to the Bank of Aus-
tralasia in Melbourne, and was with that
bank at Beechworth when the Kelly gang
was operating in the neighborhood.
Said good-bye to Westralia recently, Canon
Percy Umphraville Hinn, M.A. A school-
master of the old classical type he first set
foot in W.A. over 25 years ago. His great-
est work was the influencing of a fellow
Englishman to build the school chapel at
Guildford Grammar School, of which he was
headmaster, at a cost of over £40.000. “Old
Toke,” as he is known to all Guildfordians,
has tried his hand at poetry, too, and a few
months ago brought out “The Dying Bush-
man and Other Western Australian Verses.”
His successor at Guildford is Philip Hinck-
ley, M.A., M.C., late of Christ’s Hospital,
England.
Heard the call, at 84, Michael Fahey, genial
Irishman and well-known West Queens-
lander. Although he could neither read nor
write, Mick added a store to his original
hotel venture, and made a success of both.
On one of his occasional visits to the coast
he was accosted by a couple who claimed
an old friendship and a present acquaint-
ance. Slightly deaf, Mick forced his friends
to talk rather loudly when making their re-
quest for a trifling loan. When he eventu-
ally understood what they meant, he an-
swered: “Shure, I'm sorry, bhoys, I have
no change on me. But get you up to me
pub and tell the bar-woman to give ye a
couple of drinks apiece.” “Thanks, boss,”
they chorussed, preparing smartly to move
off—“where is your pub?” “Ah, sure, I
thought ye knew me. Well, then, ye must
know me pub is up in Ky-noony.”
J. N. WILLIAMS, the Melbourne man who
manages the affairs of the Retail
Grocers' Association of [?] and
half a dozen similar bodies.
The adventurous life of H. Y. S. Gurcy,
journalist and other things, has ended sud-
denly in Adelaide. When lie .came ro Aus-
tralia in 1920 he claimed to have been a;:
various times, on Methuen’s staff in the Borr
War, secretary to the Duke of West min-
ster’s Cheshire estates, dramatic critic of
London Daily Telegraph, chairman of the
Primrose League and a major in the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers through the Great War.
In Adelaide he was on the Advertiser staff,
editor of the Digger, and at the time of his
death editor of a new venture, the People.
When Joe Harris, member for South
Yarra, was edged out of Vic. Assembly on
the recasting of seats in 1904, lie was
72 and regarded as an old man;
but he lived till last week, and was
going strong till the end. For more
than 25 years he was horticultural editor
of the Australasian, and until a few years
ago was on the Council of Agricultural
Education. In Parliament he was Conserva-
tive, but something more than a mere brake
on Radicalism. lie never had a taste of
office during his 21 years in the House.
Had he been as pushing as some of the
present-day members with less capacity, he
might have been a Minister in more than
one Government.
“Alphabetical” Reid is having thrust upon
him the honors which he longingly sought
in the days of his dead youth. When he
drove his baker’s cart round Penrith 35
years ago he rehearsed the speeches that
later w r ould be heard by the groundlings. His
one Parliamentary candidature in those days
was disastrous, but now he has reached his
second life. Three or four years ago he got into
the Assembly on preference votes which were
probably never ifitended to reach him. Then
lie was beaten ; but now, through the retire-
ment of Arthur Cocks, he has his old seat
given him. And, finally, as a sitting member,
he automatically takes his place among the
Nationalist candidates with all the prestige
of a seat-holder.
“Alastor”: Fred Dickson, Queensland’s
Crown Prosecutor for 40 years, is still going
strong, though his feet are in the shadow
of the 70th milestone. A keen and witty bar-
rister, he has acted as Judge of District,
Supreme and Arbitration Courts; but as he
was not in the political limelight when per-
manent appointments to the judiciary were
made, the powers that be passed him
by. Dickson is a son of the man who was
Premier of Bananaland when Federation
was adopted, and his reminiscences go back
to the trial of Ned Kelly in Melbourne, which
he listened to as a law student.
“M.”: “Adamascus” (B. 5/2/’25) is wrong
about a writ being served on Judge Lutwyche
50-odd years ago. I lived in Brisbane at
the time of the Duke of Edinburgh’s visit,
and remember the circumstances. The com-
mittee of entertainment refused to pay the
caterer’s claim on the "round that the menu
was not in accord with tender, and the
caterer sued the committee, not the Judge.
Lutwyche tried the case, and being a great
gourmand busily cross-examined plaintiff.
For instance, regarding the pigeon-pie, he
asked, “Caterer, did you leave the pigeons’
feet sticking through the crust?” “Yes, your
Honor.” Verdict for plaintiff, with costs
against the entertainment committee.
COMMISH!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Witness said he supported himself by organising
Art Unions, etc., for t haritable purposes.”
I'm a tender-hearted sort of a chap.
When | hear of a tale of woe
I draw up a new subscription list
And into the job I hoe
Of raising cash for a bloke that’s down,
Or aiding a widow’s wish
To purchase a nice little corner pub—
On a twenty per cent, commish.
It may be a struggling two-up school
That has got behind with the rent,
Or a perishing punter who followed the trots
Till his old man’s wad was spent.
But, whether it’s chapel, or church or pub,
All that enter my net are fish ;
And I’ll set them free on a solvent sea—
For a twenty per cent, commish.
When I hear the call of an SOS
In Charity’s sacred name
I'm always -ready to add a score
To my cash-collecting fame.
No matter whether it’s sinner or saint
Who falls in the charity dish.
You’ll find me ready to help him out—
For a twenty per cent, commish!

BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Silcx” : Two grey thrushes have for many
years reared their young in an African boxthorn at
the end of my garden. Of the last brood, one infant
had shown a disinclination to leave the nest, and
had been a cause of much noisy solicitude on the
part of mum and dad. Recently, there has been
such squawking and clamoring that, with the aid
of a pair of steps, I decided to investigate. I
found the nest partly demolished and the overdue
fledgling securely tethered by a tingle of sewing
cotton which had formed part of the nest lining.
Immediately the prisoner was released, the parents
set to work rebuilding with the old material; but
they carefully avoi Yd the thread that I had left
hanging on a near-by branch.
“Gougor ’: I know a flash .Tap cruising
the Barrier pearling seas who
was just a bit too shrewd.
From the abos. who shipped
under him he learnt many
native customs and beliefs,
particularly those appertaining
to witchcraft. So one fine
day', when shell was not com-
ing in plentifully, he an-
nounced to the divers that
they were lazy and useless,
and as punishment he’d call
on the spirits to teach them
to dive better in future. The
bucks were interested but
sceptical. They’d never had
a Jap wizard them before and
reckoned he couldn’t do it.
He did. First with an over-
dose of Epsom salts, and then
with threats that the “sick-
ness” would continue until a
substanital increase in shell
was brought about. He con-
tinued the treatment and the
boys dived and dived and
dived. From the first streak
of dawn until dark they dived.
Sundays and all. What with
fear and overwork, they were
soon just living skeletons, but
they filled the schooner with
shell. However, the Jap had
overdone it. When he tri-
umphantly anchored, fully
loaded, off Thursday Island,
the boys crawled off that boat
like plague rats. They spread
the news ashore that Shika-
shima was the very devil of
a witch doctor and any boy
who shipped with him had far
better be dead. And Shika-
shima had long, unpayable
cruises among the islands be-
fore he eoulcl pick up half a
crew to work the boat.
“TeW.” : That accusation against the death-
adder of springing at the person it wants to bite prob-
ably arises from the fact that it may be brought back
looped around a stick used in striking at it, as the
stick is withdrawn for another blow. The reptile
does, in attacking, bring its head and tail smartly
together; in one recorded instance it jambed the
horny tail-point, as well as its fangs, into a man’s
boot. In death-adder execution the stick should be
drawn back after each blow, not lifted as is done
in the case of other snakes. As a rule the killer, unless
an old hand, is excited, and tries to get his blows
in in record time, and thus the adder may be lifted
on the stick.
“Barcoo's” last paragraph :
It is the female emu that watches over the destinies
of the young birds once they are hatched. Of course,
she it is who lays the eggs, father hovering about
near, mostly acting in the capacity' of a decoy, to
encourage any trespasser away from where his mate
is doing her duty ; but once this is attended to the
male bird’s real troubles begin. The female is the
boss cocky of .her family circle, and, with her duties
completed, father has to attend to the incubation.
MOTHER WAS NOT A VEGETARIAN.
“Give me ’alf a pound of ’emp seed, please, and will you enter
it up?”
“Is it for your mother?”
“No, it’s for our canary.”
Woe betide his hide if he shirks his job, as she
will hustle him back on to his perch on top of her
setting. TJie mother bird is at this period very
savage indeed, and jealously guards against any-
thing approaching where the nest is cleverly camou-
flaged. Stock that she cannot inveigle away from her
treasures she will attack ; viciously kicking with one
foot after the other, she soon makes a clearance. If
sheep are being driven towards the nest,
the male bird will get off the nest and assist his
better half in proper style. Anyone who has been
within range of the bombardment can testify that
the thuds can be heard half a mile away. It is not
generally known that two lady-birds often collabo-
rate ; thus nests containing from 16 to 26 eggs are
sometimes located. How the two females draft out
their respective families after the pairs of husbands
have hatched out. the brood beat me, but they do,
as 10 chicks are the most recorded as following
one fowl. In every setting there are two or three
eggs in which the young do not materialise. Those
eggs crack open simultaneously witjh the coming out
of the chicks, a job which takes from two
to four days to complete. It is from those duds
that the young chicks get their fodder while in
the staggering stage. They pick the ffiells clean of
every vestige of yolk before Ma can encourage them
afield. But they soon get their legs: the second day
out from home they can run like fiends let loose.

“Light Horse”: There is no need for
“Clio” (B. 19/2/’25) to worry about the scarab
beetles imported from Syria becoming a pest in
Australia, like the rabbit, Tom Walsh, prickly pear
and other parasites. The beetles’ activities are so
highly beneficial to any community that one hopes
the imported scarabs will increase and multiply.
Not till synthetic milk, mutton and beef have banished
sheep and cattle, and the motor-car and tractor have
pushed the horse over the horizon of yesterday, will
hunger threaten the scarab’s existence. Even then
the pony races will probably persist, and there he
will be able to eke out an existence amid congenial
surroundings.

“Bouragi” : “W.J.O.’s” theory (B. 26/2/’25)
that the N.O. abo. did not rise to the conception
of a Supreme Being, because life was too easy, is
ingenious. So is his postulate that the Asiatics, liv-
ing in terror of carnivorous animals, were forced to
evolve the idea of a benign protector, or an evil
spirit calling for placation. But the rule doesn’t
hold good. Just across the water from North
Queensland is the Papuan, even better provided for by
Nature than the N.Q. abo., anti, like him, in no
danger save from his fellow-man and an occasional
crocodile. Yet the Papuans, and especially the
western tribes contiguous to Queensland, have most
elaborate beliefs as to the existence, not only of a
Supreme Being, but of a regular hierarchy of gods
and demons. “W .J.C.’s” remark, too, that “courage
is foreign to Binghi” is very wide of the fact, in
m.' opinion; and 1 have known Black Brother inti-
mately since my childhood. The Australian abo. is
not the only individual who whistles when walking
through the churchyard. His physical courage is
beyond question.
* * * *
“A eronal”: Until quite recently I had
always looked upon the wax-bill, or red-browed finch
(vulgarly “red-head”),
as a harmless but rather
useless little fowl, al-
though he incidentally
disposes annually of
a considerable quan-
tity of weed seeds. A
party of the dapper
olive-green birds, how-
ever, turned up the
other day busily comb-
ing white ants (ter-
mites) out of decaying
timber, and thus help-
ing to reduce the num-
bers of this most des-
tructive and insidious
pest. This finch builds
a retort-shaped nest of
fine grass lined with
soft feathers—usually
including some bright
ones from parrots among
the interior upholstery.
As the clutch may
number as many as six
pure white eggs, it is
probable that more than
one female lays in a
nest. The “diamond
sparrow” (spotted-sided
finch) is much less pro-
lific and is not social-
istic in habit. Cuckoos
instinctively avoid the
nests of finches, as these
birds, being seed-eaters
mainly, would not
supply the young cuc-
koos with suitable
board, though the lodg-
ings is quite O.K. The
finches often feed in
gardens, and I think
are quite cute enough
to avoid poisonous
flower-seeds, such as
those of larkspur,
though domestic chick-
ens are not, and somc-
times die from the poison which these seeds contain.

“X2X”: Bleeding from the nose in a
horse is not so hopeless as it might seem from
the remarks of “Dingo” (B. 19/2/’25). In most
cases adrenalin hydrochloride solution is of permanent
use only when the haemorrhage has a local origin, as
from damaged capillaries or something like that;
it should then be used in the strength of about
one part in ten thousand or less. When, however,
the cause is a general one, the fault will usually
be found in the blood itself, which 'probably is
deficient in one of the thrombin or thrombinogen
bodies which bring about coagulation, thus resulting
in a variety of equine haemophilia. In such cases
the best remedy is calcium lactate administered intem-

ally in doses of about 30 grains. It has the effect
of restoring to the blood properties whose absence
brings about the hemorrhages. As a rule, a short
course of it is sufficient to banish the bleeding, even
when the latter is a condition of some years’ standing.

JACKSON'S BRIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A woman came from clown below, from clown by
Sydneyside;
A woman came to Dorrigo, a young selector’s bride.
Her cheeks were pink as roses and her hands were
clean as snow,
W'e reckoned she would hardly stand the strain
of Dorrigo.
His clearing was some thirty miles by bridle-track
from town ;
Through ghostly, ringbarked forest aisles, past
streams that flooded down
In yellow torrents when the rains swept hill and
gulch below,
And lightning wrought its vivid chains high over
Dorrigo.
W'e said she wasn’t of the breed to stand the life
out there;
Her little, jazzy heart would bleed where pleasure
was so rare.
W’e knew the lesson she’d be taught, the plot she’d
have to hoe—
And so we grinned when Jackson brought his bride
to Dorrigo.
The women didn’t grin so much; they said it was
too bad
That any one should go to such a place as Jackson
had.
They added that he had a hide, and said they’d like
to know
W'hy Jackson 'didn’t pick a bride more used to
Dorrigo.
W'e watched them riding down the track and lost
them round the spur.
W'e said they’d soon be riding back —at least, that
we’d see her,
Before a year had passed away, go south with tales
of woe
And with a curse upon the day she rode from
Dorrigo.
THEN THE FUN STARTED.
“Tork about er hinsult! She ses, ‘Do you know ’ow
much a sponge weighs when it’s soakin’ full of
beer?’ an’ quite perlite like I ses, ‘No.’ ‘Well,’
she ses, ‘’ere’s a penny, go an’ weigh yerself!’”
She came Back into town all right before a year
ha/1 run.
The horse she rode was streaked with white, herself
was nearly done.
She asked us for the doctor’s place—-“a tree had
fell on Joe.”
She’d ridden at a racing pace from there to Dorrigo.
We didn’t cheer for Jackson’s bride, though she
was worth a cheer —
We saddled for the dreary ride; the doctor brought
his gear.
Then over rugged mountain tracks we let the echoes
know
Bush horses are not pampered hacks—at least in
Dorrigo.
We wondered as we spurred along how Jackson’s
bride came through.
The rains had swelled each mountain stream; the
tracks were poor and few.
With dripping branches overhead and jagged paths
below
\\ e hastened on and little said of her or Dorrigo.
We found him where a swinging tree had caught
him in its fall;
Nor did it call for much to see that that had ended
all.
W e took him up into the shed they knew as home;
and slow,
With twinkling stars high overhead, we rode to
Dorrigo.
Poor Jackson’s bride has headed south as we fore-
told she would
Who saw the softness of her mouth and little
understood
The great heart beating in her breast, the heart
we didn’t-know
Till, riding homeward from our quest, we came to
Dorrigo.
They hushed our voices at the door of Wiley's pub,
and we
Then heard a voice unknown before in that old
hostel ry....
They said that both were quite all right, though
she was somewhat low
Whose babe was born at eight the night she
rode to Dorrigo.
W'e faced the bar, an awkward rank, and scarce
a word was spun,
But it was understood we drank the health of
Jackson’s son.
And then in silence, side by side, we laid our
liquor low—
The toast was simply “Jackson’s bride, who came
to Dorrigo.”

May we talk to you about the phonograph in
your own home? Just how’ much does it mean
to you and the family?
The full glory of music, you know, is not its
tunefulness nor its massed harmonies, but its
exquisite richness in qualities almost too subtle to
be given a name. If any part of these are left
out, then it is music with the soul gone —and
music with the soul gone is just imitation music.
It is unfortunately true that the music of many phonographs is but
imitation music—they are interesting for the faint hope of what
might be accomplished some day. Of course, such a machine
enables you to call upon your imagination—but when it comes to
falling passionately in love with what it has to give—well, it can t
be done!
Listen in critical mood to the instrument in your own home—ask
yourself whether any quality is lacking that was present in the
original? And if the answer is "Yes!” then is it not time to
change to a phonograph whose production lacks nothing of the
performance of the living artist?
In the New Edison we offer you “the phonograph that has ensnared
the soul of music;" more than this, we offer you the opportunity
of hearing it in your own home in direct comparison, side by side
with any other machine, that your own ears may be the judge.

12/5/’25) that horses’ legs might be protected from
prickly-pear thorns by guards is a lot older than
the Zane Grey novel he credits with the idea. The
Bushveldt Boers of the Northern Transvaal practised
the dodge long ago, and at least one Australian
mounted regiment in the 1899-1902 business copied
it. The Bushveldt is overrun with the thorny
acacia known to the Dutchmen as the wacht-en-bitjc.
Horses ridden through the grass are pricked on
the coronet by the seedling growths of this acacia,
sepsis, laminitis and often permanent lameness
resulting. The Boer use'd a guard of greenhide
coming well down the hoof and going up to the
fetlock joint. It had to be carefully cut, but, put
on wet, gripped the hoof and was kept firmly in
position by its own shape, plus a simple lace at the
back.
* * * *
“Speargrass”: Saw a big mahogany
chopped down in N.Q., and embedded six inches
within the wood was an old-time tomahawk, handle
intact. Some long-forgotten pioneer whose body is
dust must have buried the blade deep in the tree
and forgotten it or the tree’s whereabouts, and the
bark and growing wood reached about the encum-
brance and simply “swallowed” it. I’ve often
known horseshoes hung on limbs to be engulfed in
this way. A little more difficult of explanation are
the tiny frogs that are occasionally found encased
deep within living wood. In such cases no crack is
open for air or tucker, and how the frog got there,
and why the tree does not completely close in the
tiny chamber that fits the living mummy’s body, I
have never heard explained.
* * * *
“Up Top” : A wonderful sight is the even-
ing flight of the glossy starlings to their island
camping-grounds, off the N.Q. coast. Far up over
the mainland they arise in small flocks, which unite
until they form huge, dense clouds. As the strag-
glers come in the main clouds fly in great
circles, which suddenly drop low, to rise again in
a long, spiral column, looking like an upward wind-
A SPOIL SPORT.
P.C.: “Ye blackguard — man-handlin’ yer poor wife like that! I’m
goin’ to run ye in.”
POOR WIFE: "Oh, don't do that, constable — you’ll 'interrupt me
honeymoon!”
ing cloud of black smoke. Re-forming into
one cloud they rise higher and higher, circling
and sweeping, sometimes almost invisible in the
sky; then they move for the island in one enor-
mous black flight as the last sunrays shine on their
massed backs. When they near the land they swoop
low, skimming the water with wonderful speed and
roar of wings, to crash in a shrieking mass into the
mangroves.
“Dry” : I left my william-can at home one
day. The prospect of a dinner without tea did not
appeal to me. Fishing in the tucker-bag, I found
a sound paper-bag. Making a fire, I propped the
bag full of water near it. By constantly pouring
water into the bag, the top of it was prevented from
burning. The water boiled, the tea was made, and
there was no prouder man in all the land than I.
THE BANKRUPT.
JACK: “ Bill looks scared — he’s not frightened at getting married, is he?”
MAC : “No, the fact is he’s just done the wedding fee in at two-up and doesn't know how
to chat the parson about it.”
“James B.”: I was attracted by what I
thought was a green leaf waving to and fro on a
vine. In an hour I returned and found it still wav-
ing, but very feebly. It was’ a green caterpillar four
inches long, neatly spiked on a dead twig. The
spike entered the body near the tail, came out again,
re-entered an inch nearer the head, and thence pro-
jected for about four inches. He could not have
impaled himself, and there were no children about.
I have read of birds storing their food in this way,
and there were two tiny blue wrens nesting in the
vine. Still I doubt if they were strong enough to
handle so big a beast.
“Wingella”: At
a big N.T. eorroboree I
noticed that one young
buck was not dancing,
and asked him his rea-
son. “No more bin
makum young man yet,
boss,” he said. “You
bin makum young man
long time,” I retorted.
“Two wet season you
bin makum young
man.” “Yowi,” he
answered, “only I no
more bin makum
young man longa me.
Mate longa me him
close up bin makum
young men, him bin
die quick-fellow, no
more bin finish makum
young man. King
bin talk, ‘You come
on, makum young man
longa your mate.’ I
bin makum young man
longa him, no more
longa me. Bymby, two
more wet season come
on, 1 makum young
man longa me, plenty
savvy dance then.”
This boy has a wife,
a young lubra, and has
had her for the last
six years, to my know-
ledge, but until he is
“made 3 T oung man”
the marriage cannot be
consummated, and sbe
still remains with her
father. I’m still won-
dering how Sambo will
be able to go through
the ceremony (circum-
cision) a second time.
Is it customary for a
boy to take a dead
mate’s place in this
affair ?
‘‘Centre”: Is there any animal, wild or
otherwise, that makes and follows a straight track?
Every pad and path I’ve come across in Australia
and elsewhere has been crooked, weaving from side
to side with no apparent reason, often over perfectly
level and clear ground leading to drinking places.
I’ve a few cows, and morning and evening, when
coming in to be milked, they follow the same old
zigzag up to the bails. The horses do the same
thing, following their own particular track day after
da - v - Thel ' e must be fully 20 trails leading to the
waterhole at the further end of the paddock, but
every one of them is as crooked as a dog’s hind leg.
The same Puzzle exists with insects. Ants seem
incapable of making straight runs; a termites’ nest
doesn’t contain two straight inches in all its hundreds
of feet of passages.
“Iveppel”: Cotton-growers in my part of
Queensland have been troubled with a worm like
a grey slug, as thick as a man’s finger, and about
2in. long. One grower had his plants destroyed
as soon as they broke the surface of the ground.
Having killed the plant, the worms burrow into
the soil and a dozen or more can be found at each
root. It has been found that if the seed is washed
before planting and soaked in a mixture of lysol
and water for about 12 hours, the plants will not
be attacked. Can the Council give it a name?
* * • •
“Hayband”: There is a cockatoo at Rooty
Hill (N.S.W.) whose original owner used to give
him lumps of sugar out of a brass bowl. Fifteen
years _ ago that owner died and the bowl was
mislaid. A week ago it turned up, and as soon as
the bird saw it he set up his old-time chant “Sugar
for Cocky.” He was never very fond of sugar, and
in all the 15 years had not mentioned it.
* * * #
“Larrapinta”: “AdeL” (B. 12/2/’25) may
rest assured that the cod (he means yellow-belly,
I presume) found in the lagoons of the N.T. and
Queensland isn’t the only fish that buries itself in
the mud when the water dries up. I’ve seen the
blacks dig up bream (red and black), piebry, yabbies,
frogs and leeches. If fish did not preserve them-
selves thus in times of drought, the lagoons would
soon cease to interest anglers. But what puzzles me
is where the fish in the Finke River (Centralia)
hide. They can’t burrow into the mud because there
is none, the bed being all rocks and sand. Yet
a few hours after a heavy rain the pools are alive
with the small native trout, and, if a flood comes
down, the water teems with fish in a week. Now,
where do they come from?
* * * #
“F.N.W.”: Soon after the Barrabool had
left the Cape on her last trip, I saw a compact
little crowd of our passengers surge down the boat-
deck ladder. I followed rapidly in their wake,
hoping someone had gone mad and was giving away
money. On the promenade deck I found one of the
immigrants sitting on the hatch with an outsize
in albatrosses closely cuddled in his arms. The
nautical flapper had a spread of nearly 10ft. and
seemed quite at home. Although disdaining the
bread and jam offered by the kids, he made no
effort to escape and kept his formidable beak at
rest. The possibility of the loss of an eye or
finger never occurred to the prospective Australians,
and it was with reluctance that they took my advice
and gave the bird a fresh start in life over the
ship’s rail. This is the first instance I have seen
where the flying visitor has not endeavored to start
a “rough house” with his captors.
* * * •
‘ Akran”: Another hardy Australian,
though only a handful. He’s a Clifford of Mon-
gogarie (Upper Richmond, N.S.W.). Mustering
+ " r| the ranee he was thrown from his horse,
the bone in one leg being broken in two places.
Knowing that there wasn t a chance of his being
picked up where he fell, the boy crawled a mile
down the side of the range to the road. There he
was found by a passer-by, and taken to hospital.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “W.J.C.” (B. 12/2/’25) shows
ignorance in denying the whole theory of hybridisa-
tion, which is the pollination of plants of different
species. He will perhaps admit the pollination of
different plants of the same species, which is
accepted as being more beneficial than self-pollina-
tion. The rhododendron and azalea are common genus-
hvbrids This type of hybridism was known to
florists in the seventeenth century, and graft-hybrid-
ism is still very common. For example, the
bizzarria is a cross between the citron and the bitter
orange. Cross fertilisation is found also among vege-
tables ; I have often seen a pumpkin-watermelon
hybrid. “W.J.C.’s” mention, by way of ridicule, of
a cross between a periwinkle and an iguanodon is a
heavy, dragging missile. Perhaps he doesn’t know
that the star-fish and the sea-urchin have been
crossed, likewise the goat and the sheep, and the lion
and the tiger. No need to tell him of the origin
of the mule.
* * * *
“B.I.Iv.”: In the days when old Jim
Underwood brought cattle in to Butterbone, on the
Macquarie, he once had a mob of 3000 head on
hand from out near Longreach. They picked up a
wether weaner near Blackall, and he chummed up with
the outfit and went along with the cattle. He cut
himself out in the evening, took to the nearest tree
for a camp, and was always the first up in the morn-
ing ; and though they had a couple of stretches of 50
miles from water to water, he never knocked up. The
trip took the best part of a year in those days, and
he was a very fine wether when they got to Butter-
bone, where the boss pensioned him off for his
friendly intelligence.
* * * ■*
“Wombat”: The common belief that death-
adders do not measure more than 2ft. 6in. in
length is wrong. On Saturday last I was shown
one in F. H. Dowell’s office, Braidwood, which taped
3ft. Olin. This adder was killed by Mr. Hain at
the foot of the Clyde Mountain, near Nelligen.
Adders, by the way, vary in color: those found in
granite country are quite unlike those at Long Bay
(near Sydney) in that respect.
* * * *
“Moe”: Although Soudan grass at certain
periods of the year is extremely poisonous to stock,
one curious feature is that it is always the second
growth of the vegetable which causes the damage,
while another is that it is seldom fatal or even dan-
gerous |to young stock, but only to full-grown ani-
mals. Recently, near Parkes (N.S.W.), a number of
cows and calves were turned into a paddock in which
there was a fair growth of the grass. Within a
couple of hours all but the calves were so seriously
affected that even bleeding failed to do them any
good; but the calves showed no ill-effects whatever,
and continued to eat the grass as though they derived
nourishment and pleasure from it.
* * * *
“Larrapinta” : About a year ago a member
of the Council wrote concerning the prejudice some
people have against eating the Murray catfish on
account of its appearance, though it is quite equal to
the cod as food. Recently I met a similar prejudice
against the rare golden mud-carp, sometimes called
the golden bream. I was at Wellington, on the
Murray (S.A.), with a fishing party, and when I
hauled in one of these gleaming beauties my mates
advised me to throw it away, as it was useless.
Knowing better, that night I persuaded them to try
HIS LUCK WAS IN.
“’Ullo, Shorty, who’s been givin’ you a
hidin’?”
“I dunno. It ’appened in a crowd.”
“You’re lucky. Now you won’t have another
trying to get even with the bloke that
gave you that one.”
a bit of the despised fish, and they were unanimous
in declaring it first-rate. This fish at his best weighs
about 41b., is of a gleaming gold color, with very large
scales, and cannot be mistaken for the imported gold-
fish by anyone who knows the latter. Who started
the insane prejudice against this beauty, and why?
A BUSHMAN BROADCASTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old mate, I’m listenin’-in —a new affair
That’s got the flamin’ joker in the pack!
it sends a message broadcast through the air
To any bloke that’s humpin’ it Out Back.
They asked me if I’d like to let one go—-
“Greetin’s,” I ses, “from Jim to Mulga Joe.”
Old mate, I wonder if .you’ve pitched your camp
(Bush freeman still and loyal to the right)
By western creeks where wild scrub-cattle stamp
And curlews cry their longing to the night,
Or if, as I, chained by unpityin’ Fate,
Captive you pine within a city’s gate.
South Austkalia.

Conventional ideas about what a Shaks-
pearean audience should be w T ere shattered
by the crowd that filled the New Palace to
welcome back Allan Wilkie last Saturday.
The vice-regal Forsters lent the show their
countenance, but the most distinctive feature
was neither fashion nor intellect, but the
multitude of youths, some of whom came
in school parties. The acting may have been
intended to be educational, but the young-
sters were determined to enjoy themselves,
and their applause was boisterous. In
the one interval which Allan Wilkie allows
the boys tumbled into the vestibule to drink
the soda-fountain dry. The noise caused a
lifting of some eyebrows which take their
Shakspeare as a very solemn thing.
The Queen’s Hall was well filled on Thurs-
day night when violiniste Isobel Langlands
and pianiste Rene Morrissy combined and
got elocutionary help from Alba Zacutti.
Both the principals were at the top of their
form, but their opening number, Tartini’s
G Minor Sonata, was too long to
hold the attention of any but the
elect. So was Alba Zacutti’s effort;
not even a Bernhardt could have kept
an audience interested in her story of a
nightingale, a red rose and a lovesick stu-
dent. Lady Forster, in her favorite blue,
gave the recital her vice-regal blessing. Isobel
Langlands faced the house in blue georgette
with a short, flared tunic bristling with
rosy ostrich fronds; slim Rene Morrissy
wore cyclamen pink.
The Stradbrokes are returning in units to
their homeland. First it was young Keith,
then little Peter, and after them son, George.
Now Lady Helena Rous has left by the
Maloja: she will drop off at Port Said,
and will be introduced to the Pyramids
by Lord Allenby and his wife. After that
she may go on to England, but the chances
are she will come back to Melbourne.
A good deal may depend on a fairy-film
which Brandon Cremer is making for the
Carrolls. One of the bright ideas regarding
the new Athenamm was that it might be util-
ised in the afternoons for picture entertain-
ments designed entirely for children.' The
films shown would be fairy and children’s
stories with a little natural history-—some-
thing entirely different from the hectic offer-
ings which children see at ordinary picture-
shows, and of which that good Australian,
the Rev. Chas, Strong, says (unanswerably)
that “they fill the young mind with false
and distorted ideas of sex, and make it fami-
liar with crimes of violence.” Inquiries in
America and England showed that a supply
of pictures on the lines desired could not be
assured. So if the Brandon Cremer experi-
ment succeeds, Australian production will
have opened up a promising field in which
there is not likely to be competition from
Hollywood.
The dear old Women’s National League
celebrated its coming of age by mobilising
its branches in the Town Hall. St. Kilda,
the suburb where it was born. The League’s
colors and yards of bunting clothed the walls,
and musical items decorated the talk. With
the present “heads” on the platform were
four of the original six foundation members
—Mrs. A. E. Clarke, General Fred Hughes’s
wife, Mrs. P. Douglas and Mrs. W. Kidgell.
Mrs. Crocker filled the presidential seat, and
amongst those who testified were Federal
Attorney-General Littleton Groom and Chief
Sec. Stanley Argyle. Loyalty to the throne
and the Liberal party are the League’s
slogans, and no petticoated aspirant to Par-
liamentary honors need apply for its sup-
port. At any rate, she will have a pretty
hard scramble to get it.
Mrs. Chris. Cowper beckoned her friends
to Menzies’ to chin-chin daughter Lila over
the teacups. Lila forfeited the return-half
of her steamer ticket last year, while tripping
in London, to marry a British naval “loot,”
Crealock Price, and has since been living
in China. Mrs. Cowper how-d’-ye-do-ed the
company in cinnamon crepe dashed with
rust-red and a black hat crowned with
ospreyish ornaments. Mrs. Price had clad
her slimness in white with red embroidery
edging the front pinny, and smiled from
tinder a wide-brimmed thatch of apricot.
Beryl Cowper, in vivid red topped by a black
hat, helped to see that no one went short
of cake or strawberries. The chatter was
backed by the music of a stringed orchestra.
Winchester’s former headmaster, Dr. M.
J. Rendall, who as one of the members of
the Rhodes Trust is circling the world to
see what the Dominions have to teach him,
suffers from deafness when the suggestion
of throwing open the scholarships to women
is raised. The founder, he says, never con-
templated such a step; but he is willing to
acknowledge that when woman proves her
worth in the field of public life she will have
established her claim to assistance of this
sort. Rhodes, he says, wanted neither ath-
letes nor scholars as such, but men with good
brains, sound bodies and, above all, character.
The distinguished pedagogue is accompanied
by two Oxonians as unofficial advisers, M. R.
Wright and C. Dalby. He had been looking
forward to the meeting in Melbourne with
his brother, Charles Rendall. Charles founded
Haileybury College at Brighton, and only
retired from the headmastership a few years
before his death, which happened just before
the doctor left England on this trip.
Admiral Creswell’s dame presided over the
first gathering of Sailors’ Wives and Mothers
for the year as understudy to Admiral Hall
Thompson’s wife, now tripping in the
Dominion. The Independent Hall housed the
tea and music. The old admiral’s lady, who
is a skilful racontcnsc. talked informatively
about her recent S’African experiences, tak-
ing her listeners over the wide spaces of the
Karoo and through the Kimberley diamond
mines, stirring their souls to envy with her
picture of swarms of Kaffirs always wait-
ing to do the household chores. She further
told them of the .To’burg firm which built
daughter Noel’s bridal gown, and of how it
used the remnants to dress a doll as a replica
of the bride, exhibiting the trifle later in its
shop window. Finally the lady called for
funds to put a headstone over the grave
of Naval Bos’n Punshon, of the Hood,
who died while the Special Squadron was in
Melbourne.
Our Housewives’ Association president,
Mrs. Glencross, and her sister committee-
women gave an At Home in the Queen’s
Hall, with the N.S.W. Housewives’ president,
Portia Geach, as principal guest. The tea
and chatter w r ere reinforced with songs by
Mrs. T. Blackburn and Mrs. O’Keefe, and
with some bright details from Portia about
the recent conference of the of
Women’s Clubs at Los Angeles. The gather-
ing included the Vic. Association’s first presi-
dent, Mrs. Herbert Brookes, daughter of
late Priminister Alfred Deakin.
Mrs. Esmond Lillies, the winner of the
Sun’s five-shilling frock competition, is the
elder daughter of our Health Minister, Dr.
Stanley Argyle. She has always been noted
for having fingers as deft with a needle as
with a tennis racquet ; and as Inez Argyle
she was one of the million listed as Edward
P.’s favorite dance partner. Australian
girls, like their French sisters, are gifted
with a dress sense. From the Toorak damsel
to the factory hand, they realise that it is
not so much the gown that matters as the
way you wear it; or the material as the way
you cut it. The hundreds of frocks, costing
five bob or under, which have been overflow-
ing the Sun’s competition shelves, prove the
truth of this. The cut and style of the win-
ning trio might move a Paris dress-builde.r
to shrugs of envy.
The bright-faced damsel in this Broothorn
picture is Gertrude Gray, one of the song-
birds from the East Melbourne Con. aviary,
who warbled
so sweetly in
the recent
grand opera
chorus. Her
fine mezzo-
soprano was
shown the
way it should
go by Anne
Willi a m s.
Since the pass-
ing of the
opera she has
been “on the
air” in broad-
lasting studios,
chiefly in Syd-
ney, and now
has decided to
settle down to
teaching. Ger-
trude is a St.
Ivilda girl, and
daughter of
Major Gray, a retired gunner.
A popular Pensliurst girl, Edith Greig,
played principal girl at a ceremony in the
local Scots’ kirk the other day with an ex-
Indian Army officer, Harry Stansfield, as
leading man. She dressed the part charm-
ingly in ivory brocade with green leaves
girdling her wedding veil.
Like Oscar Asche, the Bates Post couple
take the pleasures of the table seriously.
Friends asked in to feed at a select little
dinner soon find themselves moved to talk
about the food instead of over it. At their
very first dinner-party here, served at
the Oriental, the invited spilled notes of
exclamation over every course. After the
coffee Mrs. Guy sang to her guests. Walter
Kirby seconded her, and the actor-host dis-
closed Stephen Leacock’s recipe for making
husbands out of champagne bottles.
Geelong Grammar boys got the thrill of
their young lives the other morning, when
Cuthbertson House went up in smoke before
their eyes. Boarders manfully choked back
their sobs as they watched their wardrobes
going, followed by the savings bank, con-
taining a whole hundred pounds. Only a
handful of the most speedy managed to sal-
vage clothes in the pyjamaed flight for safety;
but to demonstrate that no one was down-
hearted some nimble-minded youths dragged a
gramophone on to the scene to cheer the
crowd with ragtime. In the excitement no
one appears to have thought of using the
chemical extinguishers. It will cost the
school fifteen thousand pounds to repair the
damage and six months to do it in.
This is J. B. Cooper, a good Australian
who has had a chequered career along the
Inky Way. He has two novels, published
by llodder and Stoughton, and one play, pro-
duced in Syd-
ney, to his
credit; and his
two-column de-
scription of a
dog - fight in
Hobart Town,
contributed to
The j Bulle-
tin, is now a
classic in “Fis-
tiana” scrap-
fa o o k s. He
tramped over
France and
Paris after the
war, an d
found the
Latin quarter
as respectable
as Toorak, and
M o ntmartrd’s
Rohemianism a
fake readied
up for Ameri-
cans. He finds compiling local histories pays
better than writing fiction or chasing news,
and he is to-day the official municipal re-
corder of Prahran, St. Ivilda, Brighton and
Malvern. Posterity will owe him something,
hut that does not trouble “J. 8.,” since he’ll
be past debt-collecting. He says his prin-
cipal exercise in the field of literature in
these days of his ponderous respectability is
“chasing the oldest inhabitant.”
Hobart Society is mourning for little
Ethel Ewing, the 18-year-old daughter of
Justice Ewing, who was killed by a fall
from her horse while riding along the banks
of the Tamar. She was a bright little ray
in the household when her father was acting-
Governor, and her dances were second to
none in popularity.
Something more has been heard from
London about the Romney brought to
Hobart many years ago by the late
Francis Butler —a picture of a woman,
the gift of a relative, a great-aunt.
Her idea was that it was a portrait of the
beautiful Emma Hamilton, Nelson’s devoted ;
and her excuse for keeping it with its face
to the wall was that “it was the picture of a
very wicked woman.” It hung in the dining-
room of the Butler home for many years,
till recently one of the family took it to Eng-
land for verification. Christie’s examined
it, and pronounced it a Romney; it w r as
offered for sale and brought 3300 guineas.
The Butlers have also two family portraits
by the painter-poisoner-murderer Waine-
wright, who served his final years in Hobart
Gaol, but w T as allowed to conduct a studio
under supervision.
A Melbourne girl who was married a few
days ago had one previous thrill. A few
years back she went for a trip to M.L., and,
when returning, shared a two-bertli cabin
with another young woman. The latter com-
plained of being a poor sailor, and kept
to her bunk all day, though now and then
she would go for a stroll on deck after dark.
She never mixed with the other passengers ;
she was, however, well looked after by the
stewardess, and her young cabin mate became
excellent friends with her. On arrival at
Sydney one of the first to get off the boat
was the sick lady; and the Melbourne girl
a few hours later was waited upon by a
number of detectives keenly interested in her
late travelling companion—who was a bank
manager wanted urgently on an embezzlement
charge. His disguise enabled him to make
a perfect escape.
Mrs. Bob Knox, who sheltered two Tassie
cousins, Ronda and Zeeruste Clarke, for the
autumn race season, wound up their visit
with a young people’s jazz. Mrs. Knox flew
red georgette, fringed with ostrich fronds,
cousin Ronda fluttered like a dewy leaf in
beaded green, and cousin Zeeruste added
vivid orange to the riot. All the best-known
young things had been bidden, and amongst
the lookers-on were Senator Frank Guthrie
and the Russell Clarkes.
Austral Salon members foregathered last
week for the first dispensation of tea and
music in their new parlors. Beams of appre-
ciation played on the new committee room
with its cosy furnishings and blue iand
brown upholsterings, a color scheme which
overflows into the reception-room. The star
guest was Doris Ross, the budding pianist
who is leaving the ’Varsity Con. to study
across seas, and who helped Mrs. Quinnell's
programme with two charming solos.
Having taken her science degree at the
local Uni., Margaret Cunningham, a niece
of the Argus’s editor, has crossed to Sydney
to shoulder the job of welfare superintendent
at Anthony Horderns’. During her ’Varsity
days she took a keen interest in the Student
Christian movement, and in 1922 was sent
to China as Victorian delegate to the world’s
conference, held in Pekin, a conference, by
the way, that provoked a counter movement
amongst non-Christian Chinese which still
goes merrily on, and hopes to drive Christian-
ity out of China. There is no need for Mar-
garet to butter her own crust, but she is an
independent soul who likes to fend for her-
self. Her dad, Charlie Cunningham, who
earned the rank of major while looking after
the Anzac post office in Gallipoli, and after-
wards in France, has just sold his Toorak
mansion to trip to England with his wife,
son and step-daughter.
Mrs. William Laidlaw will flutter a cheque
for £l5O or more into the District Nursing
►Society’s building fund because of a garden
ffite staged in her picturesque South Yarra
home, Botanic House. As the matron and
her feminine helpers had footed the bill for
initial expenses, all the takings went to the
cause. Bridge-players were in the parlors,
and amateur salesladies, on the lawns; and
the Blind Asylum Band made music in the
offing. Sybil Nicholls had decorated the in-
terior of the house as her contribution, and
the tea came out of Mrs. Laidlaw’s caddy.
The local polo clubs epilogued the Strad-
broke Cup contests with a dinner to the visit-
ing teams at Menzies’. During the evening
it was unanimously decided to wind up next
year’s polo contests in fitting style with a
ball, proceeds to be handed to a charity.
Ada Casey, who accompanied niece Wilma
Berkeley to London about two years ago,
had the ill-luck to fall on the sick-list, but
is now taking notice again after an opera-
tion. Wilma faces her first London audi-
ence in the Wigmore Hall this month, and
has been booked for a preliminary warble
at one of the Duchess of Rutland’s at-homes.
The fan which the Duchess of Atholl,
M.P., fluttered in the face of the Father of
Parliaments —the very first to be used in
those sacred precincts—has been acquired
and presented by somebody to the Perth
Museum (Scotland). Visitors who used to
gaze reverently at Marie Stewart’s green
slipper at Drummond Castle will doubtless
now hurry past to feast their eyes on the
Duchess’s fan.
The Civil Ambulance Ball has been dated
for American Fleet Week —July 23, to be
precise. Gertrude Rennie will again drive
the pen.
Sister Adelaide’s observations :
The National Council of Women is sending its
secretary, Miss Jude, to the Washington Conference.
Hence a bundle of farewells, including one at the
Liberal Club with Mrs. C. R. Morris as hostess. Miss
Jude has rendered her party good service, and has
for ages run one of its strongest suburban branches. '
The Harold Cards, who made their name here with
the amateur grand opera co., have been singing to
the Cold Country, and had Oscar Asche and Lily
Brayton among their audience when they were
trying the musical numbers of a new show by Percy
Fletcher, the producer of “Cairo.”
The Anzac Arch, doomed long since but reprieved
for sentimental reasons, is to go at last. Spanning
the main exit from the railway station it was erected,
when Anzacs were first granted furlough, as a trium-
phal arch under which returning troops might be
reviewed. It was never intended to be permanent,
and a suggestion that a facsimile should be built in
concrete seems to have lapsed.
There are rumors of an Elder Conservatorium Asso-
ciation to give a helping hand to musical interests in
this State. It will be open to past and present
students at 2s. 6d. a head. Meanwhile the Con.’s
director, Or. Harold Davies, put in a convincing plea
on art as an essential to life at the opening social
of the 1925 season.
The engagement is announced of Mrs. Arthur
Hughes, just sailed for England, to Dr. Telford, of
Ballarat, once of Port Lincoln, in this State.
Mr. Glover’s fund for giving band instruments and
a silver shield to H.M.A.S. Adelaide finds itself with
over £l7O in hand after paying everyone. The
ship is to have another £lO for music; then, if the
subscribers are willing, the balance is to buy addi-
tional instruments for the orchestra of the Royal
Institution for the Blind at North Adelaide.
The usual crowd of admiring relatives and flappers
saw St. Peter’s make their red and white rivals bite
the grass with a nine to six win at the Oval tennis-
courts, with the Saints’ captain, Sangster, as the
hero of the games.
At the Cheltenham races the club’s president, R.
M. Hawker, just back from England, did the honors
at lunch, flanked by a brace of State and Federal
politicians, and handed out trophies and congratu-
lations to winners afterwards, while his daughter
kept a hospitable eye on the feminine official party.
It was a warmish day, with cool georgettes and
crepe de Chines as the most successful wear, topped
by a kaleidoscope of giddy sunshades.
St. Mark’s College, our first step towards residential
University life, began work this week. Public sub-
scriptions bought the Downer home on Pennington-
terrace, and a fete at St. Peter’s College furnished it.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Penwoman Eva Clarke, who goes to Mel-
bourne to join The Bulletin’s staff there,
has been caught up this past fortnight in a
hurricane of good-bye parties. One ol the
most modest of women, she is still running
her eyes with surprise over these popular
demonstrations. Sister presswomen, just as
this Letter slips into its pinny, are staging
a lunch in her honor at the, Wentworth, and
on the same afternoon nearly 200 women
friends are foregathering to her glory m the
ballroom of the Australia. _ A fur coat, a
soldier-woven rug, a travelling trunk and a
cheque are among the parting gifts she will
have to find houseroom for in Melbourne.
And the bell has been nearly worn off her
Macquarie-street flat, by special messengers
laden with florists’ boxes and the mysteri-
ous gifts that are felt but not seen. Miss
Clarke is a native of Brisbane, and her
father was one of the Northern State’s early
artists. For 10 years she has written the
Sydney letter for the Brisbane TELEGRAPH,
and during that period has been associ-
ated also with Sydney publications. She
has written hundreds of paragraphs for The
Bulletin, has on several occasions been
understudy for this Letter-writer, and. until
last week had edited the woman’s section of
the Freeman’s Journal very attractively.
For the second time Wollongong was
chosen for the scene of the L.G.U.'s fore-
gathering in the interests of country golf.
Eighty women, equipped to the teeth and
with a look of deathless determination in
tlieir eye, have inhabited the pretty nine-
hole links for seven days, and man in those
parts has been mostly consigned to the club-
house verandah, where distracted females be-
tween rounds devour the more-or-less-made-
by-themselves tea, and the toothsome cakes
supplied by local members, casting meanwhile
an observant eye over rivals playing off on
the ninth green. From this anchorage one
overlooked a multitude of striped Fuji frocks,
elbow-sleeved, and some new-season knitted
woolly suits, of which the cinnamon browns
and stone-greys won the popularity vote
among the male lookers on. A sharp con-
troversy, carried on in undertones on the
rival merits of skirts and plus-fours, resulted
in a verdict for plus-fours allied to the well-
turned country champion, Miss Poidevin r
and one-time champion of Queensland, Miss
Green. But a roving eye over the course
saw upstanding ladies of other architecture.
The South Coast Championship was the
bauble all were after, and it will be worn
this season by Mrs. Neill. Other well-known
players were Miss Trevor-Jones, all over
black and white stripes ; the two Misses Lee,
one of rhem the champion of Wollongong:
Miss Banks, of Balmain ; and the tall cham-
pion of Beecroft.
These links are wide to the breeze from
the Pacific. One of the greens is cunningly
entangled amid the sandhills, and if a player
has eyes for anything beyond a ball he may
glimpse these autumn days a cunningly-
woven nest here and there in the hedge re-
plete with all conveniences and three tiny
blue eggs. The coach down there is the son
of George Lowe, an old celebrity in the
golf world. With Morris he helped to lay
out the famous English course Hoylake, and
afterwards himself designed the links at
Pau, the first in the south of France, as
well as the first links in Italy, close to Milan.
Of the hundreds at the Ambassadors on
Monday night not one female wore a really
long frock. Knee-caps were much worn, and
many girls were dressed in breadth without
length. Lots of bright lasses had pinned
their faith to a remnant of 40-inch material
which they had gathered about them, adding
a postscript of gold tissue, silk fringe, color-
ful rabbit or any other frieze design most
in harmony with their hose. The rally
was under Dot Brunton’s banner for
the babies of St. Margaret’s. Dot her-
self couldn’t come till late. She was
Battling Butler in the early evening, and
finally arrived in a black satin frock that
was the background for Royal Egypt’s
family-tree worked out in beads. With her
fluttered in the Charles Heslop couple and
John Kb ,y; and then everybody’s cup of
happines was filled. Presently it brimmed
over when Mrs. Stewart Dawson sent around
a note to say that she was giving 50 guineas
to'the hospital funds, and that her daughter,
Mrs. Verralh just arrived from London, was
adding another 50. Then Stewart Daw'son,
not to be outdone by his womenkind, had
a word in secretary George Fitzpatrick's ear,
and that word was xvorth £5OO. Then he
added that, if the committee could raise an-
other thousand, Stewart Dawson’s cheque
would be written for a further £5OO. Hugh
Mclntosh put up £100; and immediately two
other kind hearts dropped a hundred apiece
into the hat. It looks as though the £lO,OOO
without which the St. Margaret’s people
won’t start building will hatch itself within
the next few months.
The Mosman Golf Club hasn’t yet suc-
ceeded in making much of a course, but from
George’s Heights it has glorious views of
harbor and ocean and foreshores, and on
its scenic crown it has spent many thousands
or. a club-house. The golf it can offer not
being yet attractive enough to put the wide-
verandahed premises to good use, a series of
dances is projected; and the first of them
drew close upon 300 jazzers and putters on
a star-strewn evening of last week. Colonel
Sands organised the revel.
It’s been a long, long trail of red carpet,
bouquets, banquets and civic receptions for
homing song-bird Elsa Stralia from Fre-
mantle to Sydney ; and now the City of the
Pacific offers a tawny smile, and starts the
whole programme over again. The Austra-
lian singer deserves a few home-grown bays,
for she brings an armful of laurels plucked
in foreign lands. The associate artist on
the tour is the Madonna-faced Bessie Grif-
fiths, whose cello, as this Letter has several
times murmured, is of royal descent, and
whose art has woven a golden arabesque
over the greyness of a post-war Europe.
Bessie, who has not seen Australia since
she left it as an infant prodigy, is having an
equally loud cymbal of welcome struck on
her behalf. From March 26 to April 9 the
two will repatriate themselves at an impos-
ing list of functions that include a civic
reception, a Feminist luncheon, a press-
woman’s party and a Musical Association
dinner.
Very cosy and intimate is Louis McCub-
bin’s art-show in the vestibule balcony of
the Australia. Here, while the hotel-dwellers
write letters of love or cold duty, scenes of
a smiling earth vibrate spring green and
autumn gold above their bent heads. Shadowy
shallows, their yellow browns and greens
flecked by filtering sunlight, have an attrac-
tion for the artist and a soothing effect
upon the mental sunburn of these days.
There is keen woodland sense in “The Willow
Limb,” priced modestly enough at 10 guineas;
and for 25 there’s a vision of “Spring in
the Gardens” that is as youth-giving as a
gland operation.
Pretty and charming and altogether com-
plete Essie Ackland is steadily consuming
the cream-puff and the chicken Maryland of
goodwill and good-bye. Last week she
snatched a day off from festivities to sing
farewell to her soldierffriends at the differ-
ent war convalescent homes about the city
—the wholesome thought of a girl in whom
success only discovers fresh graces.
Mrs. W. N. Gillies, wife of the new Prcr
mier of Queensland, has made many friends
among all sections of the during
her husband’s political career, for she has
a gentle manner and an endearing person-
ality. Among
her principal
interests are
the domestic
science depart-
ment of the
Central Tech-
nical College,
and with this
she has main-
tained close
personal touch
through he r
position as
president of
the Advisory
Board. She
also takes an
active interest
the Hospi-
tal for Sick
Children, and
is a member
o f the com-
mittee. Born
in Australia, Mrs. Gillies is the mother of
a grown-up son and a daughter, the latter
Mrs. Eric George, who has one infant,
Yvonne. The Gillies home is Allynbrook,
Toowong; and, whatever her public position,
the lady can be trusted to put the family
nest first.
Sydney is buzzing with marriages among
the young, and with rumors of marriages
among those who have exchanged youth for
place and power and an elastic bank over-
draft. Even if there is nothing in the
rumors, think of how many hundreds of
suburban teaparties they have saved from
boredom during the wilting days of February.
One marriage that actually was launched
raised scarcely a ripple—that of Nena Bray
(she was Mrs. Gordon Bray before the
divorce) to Ralph Sayers, of North Sydney.
Nena is a daughter of the Julian Win-
deyers, has a shoal of relations among Mel-
bourne’s best if not brightest, the Windeyer
determination, and a pair of violet-blue eyes
of saucer-like dimensions. It is the ’groom’s
first plunge into matrimony. He comes from
the Sayers clan that has pinned its faith to
banks and banking and found the same
justified.
The piano and the vacuum will live in
harmony under the roof-tree of the newly-
united Drysdale couple. Until she whis-
pered the right word at St. Stephen’s the
other night the lady was Bessie Robertson,
the piano-player; and the man in the case
is a lean North of Englander who some time
ago came to Australia with the heart-burn-
ing query: “What is home without a
Hoover?” The wedding frock was worthy
of a special note of exclamation. It com-
bined an ivory-satin foreground, coruscat-
ing with pearls tangled in a glistening
cobweb of diamente, with a trailing rear
effect of gold lame.
R. C. Padre Bond has a name that should
attract those about to be knit in holy matri-
mony. With Father O’Farrell to help him,
he tied one knot efficiently last week, when
Grace Carew, of Bellevue Hill, and John
McFadden, of Rose Bay, poured the usual
vows into his ear at St. Mary’s. Friends
and clansmen came from Melbourne, Albury
and Launceston.
• Judith Fletcher has made this interesting
picture of Theo Cowan, one of the most
graceful and imaginative sculptors Australia
has produced. Lately the lady spent some
months in the
Solomon
Islands visit-
ing her sister,
Mrs. Syming-
ton, of Gavutu,
and the color
and poetry of
the island life
so enthralled
her that she
recorded many
of its most
glowing mo-
ments in color
—both oil and
water. These
she will ex-
h i b i t at
Swain’s Gal-
lery on the
24th and for a
fortnight there-
after. This is
the first time
Tlieo has exhibited the work of her brush,
and those who have seen the poetry and
nobility of her bronzes and marbles are
anxious to watch her expression in the more
fluid medium.
Patrick Desmond Fitzgerald Murray.
B.Sc., youngest son of Papua’s Governor
Hubert Murray, gave his arm to his bride
in St. Mary’s Cathedral on Saturday after-
noon. She' is an attractive Summer Hill
girl, who is also followed by the letters
B.Sc. —Marjorie, the only daughter of the
G. T. Hollands. Frocked in white georgette,
with fluffs of ostrich-feather trimming, a
shimmer of pearl embroidery and a long
cloud of drapery held in place by a little
rosebud maiden—Moira Pinney, niece of the
bridegroom—the bride, who has the dark
eyes and slender ankles of a gazelle, carried
a low coronet of orange-blossoms round her
soft brown hair. A youthful matron of
honor, Mrs. J. M. Byrne, B.Sc., wore powder-
blue embroidered in silver leaves, and a dash
of blue tulle on her head. Bridesmaid
Kathleen Connolly, B.Sc. —this was a ’Var-
sity affair, with brilliant Pat Murray as the
head of the class—was in tender tones of
pale lime georgette.
In the evening the wedding party had
floral decorations at the Hotel Mansions.
Mr. and Mrs. Holland and the ’groom’s
mother welcomed a crush of friends, with
and without learned tails to their names.
Private Sec. Leonard Murray and another
Papuan visitor, Government Sec. Champion,
brought the sun-tanned complexions of Port
Moresby to the party.
Another wedding of last week worth a
P.S. made Dorothy Hornidge, of the North
Shore, responsible for the shirt-buttons of
Keith Davis, of Young. The bride trailed
a froth of ivory georgettes moored to earth
by a long satin train, over which the misty
folds of a tulle veil cascaded. Hilda Davis
’maided, in lilac georgettes and gold accom-
paniments. St. Philip’s blessed the nuptials,
and the Mary Elizabeth harbored the cheerio.
Three just-engaged damsels joined in a
discreet two-step at a recent subalterns’ hop
in Victoria Barracks. They were Mona
Houston, who has accepted a ring from
Lieut. Tom Taylor, of the Herald survey
ship; Claire Glasgow, of Vaucluse; Colonel
McCall’s eldest treasure, who has said yes
to a sheep-man in the Queanbeyan plains.
An engagement that is fluttering the buds
of the North Shore line is that-of Georgie
Law, of Gordon, whose father was until re-
cently the B.N.Z.’s manager at Newcastle.
The man in the case is James L. Broun,
baronet, who is the lucky possessor of land
and flocks and herds up Gunnedah way.
Sailed last week by the Aorangi singing-
girl Nellie Leach and violinist Leila Waddell.
They are descending on New York, where
a 12-months’ engagement awaits them.
Nellie’s aunt is with the party, and the
two clever and popular girls took aboard a
miniature floral fete and a “Hop” caricature
of each.
There was a wedge of earnest souls at
the Australia the other morning for the
benefit of the Girl Guides and the Boy
.Scouts. It was decided to help the male
and female of the species by a riot on April
14, the same to be hereinafter called the
Easter Ball. The committee is gilt-edged.
Mrs. Geoffrey Fairfax, of the cameo profile;
Mrs. Kelso King ; the Premier’s lady; Mrs.
Sydney Herring—-these are a few of the
leaders of the hunt. But there’s one thing
Sydney would spend nearly its last farthing
on, and that is to provide the Girl Guides
with a more attractive costume. Only slim
17 can pass muster under those appalling
hats; and when you see several together you
no longer wonder why we won the war. A
nation whose women will voluntarily get
into these togs for the good of humanity
could be daunted by nothing.
The widow of the late Dr. Sydney Jamie-
son and her daughter Anne are among the
outward-bound Maloja’s passengers. The
mother of the well-known medical man, 84
years young, still lives with daughter Cissie
at Elizabeth Bay. Her husband was John
Story Jamieson, for over 40 years Austra-
lian head of the firm of Prince, Ogg and Co.,
whose premises were on the present site of
Martin-place and reached from Pitt-street to
George-street. A one-time roof-tree of the
family was at 157 Livcrpool-street, now the
site of Mark Foy’s. Mrs. Jamieson has been
50 years in Australia, and in the early days
brewed many a cup of tea for Henry Parkes,
who was one of her husband’s intimates.
Lovers of Mabel Forrest’s work will be
enthusiastic over the projected screening of
her novel, “The Wild Moth.” Mrs. Forrest
has sold the rights to the Australian Film
Productions.
A man was laughing uproariously in front
of a wide-opened magazine suspended in
tnid-air above a ferry news-stall. The maga-
zine bore its title, the Australian Home,
across the top of the two pages ; and, under-
neath, the sheets were filled with pictures
of gaols—Bathurst, Goulburn, Parramatta
and such!
A P.S. from Brisbane
After opening the Oakey show our Excellency
hastened to Toowoomba to attend the entertainment
arranged by Mrs. Frank Merritt in aid of the Bris-
bane Women’s College. A hilarious little comedy,
“The Bathroom Door,” was staged by Maxwell
Mahon, he and his wife taking the leads.
Before his Ex. went to Toowoomba he laid the
dedication-stone of the Clayfleld Memorial School of
Arts, and put in a good word for Australian authors,
many of whose works should find a home here.
His Ex. was also at the second annual meeting
of the Country Women’s Association. Nearly 200
bush visitors have been welcomed at the city rest-
room during the year, and two archbishops, Sharp
and Duhig, spoke their praise. The practical Duhig
suggested that the association might help towards
getting better houses for out-back wives and kiddies.
He thought a scheme might be evolved for reduction
of timber freight on the railways.
For bride-elect Hilda Walsh Dorothy Booker had
a party at Lennon’s amid a setting of gerberas.
The tea-sippers included Cecily Cadell-Garrick, Enid
North, Mary Power and Nora Halford.
The long-empty His Majesty’s filled with a rush
when Muriel Starr brought “East of Suez” to this
village. Heavy rainstorms have since damped the
queues, but not their enthusiasm.
Pretty Ray Corden, second of the Malcolm Cor-
den girls, of the Commercial Bank, Stanthorpe, has
accepted the usual gemmed token from Lex Mac-
naughton, Judge Macnaughton’s only son.
Before the National Council of Women in Albert
House, Freda Bage painted bright pictures of Den-
mark, and told how they welcome the Spring in
Hans Andersen’s country on Beech Sunday.
Alison Webster, daughter of the late A.B. and
Mrs. Webster, of Whinstanes, promised to love,
honor, etc., T. J. Cullen, of Emerald Downs, son of
a late surgeon-general of Cheltenham (Eng.). Amid
white lilies J. B. Armstrong tied the knot. F. Web-
ster gave away the bride, who was in ivory French
wave-satin, with a georgette train held up by little
Joan Parry-Okeden and Nancy Persse. The small
things had attendant squires in Alec Parry-Okeden
and Alec Webster, and W. B. Cullen best-manned.
The wedding cake, decorated with gun-carriage and
models of the units of flocks and herds, was cut on
the lawn at Whinstanes.
A quiet wedding took place on the same day at
St. Mary’s, Kangaroo Point, the principal conspira-
tors being Loue Edwards, of Mackay, and Dr. Erbe,
son of T. C. Erbe, Granville, Sydney, who go to
live at Coonamble.
Mrs. Ted Theodore hostessed an at-home for Mrs.
Gillies in Lennon’s ballroom, which was done up with
yellow' blossoms. The hostess was in white taffetas
with black stitchery and an artistic touch of cerise
camellias. Mrs. Gillies displayed black marocain,
and carried a posy of red rosebuds presentedr -by
Mrs. Ted. Welcoming speeches to the new Preiriier’s
lady were handed out, and some 60 guests applauded.
Archbishop Duhig motored up from Brisbahe *66
officiate at the joining of pretty Manie O’Sullivan
and Dr. Frank Lukin, at St. Pat.’s, Toowoomba.,
Only palms were used to decorate the beautiful old

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A great deal of nonsense is written about
the losses of the pore bookmaker, but up to the last
race at Rosehill (N.S.W.) on Saturday' the alleged
victim of circumstances was really having an unhappy
time. Four favorites (the two-year-olds Vaals and
Italian Knight, the three-year-old Hazel Boy and
the four-year-old King Cyllene) and four second
favorites (the three-year-olds Meenah and Loquat,
the hurdler Spearbank and Polycletan) had won.
And then McShortodds got out of it, for the English
horse Golden Knight, trained by B. It. Payten for
J. S. Love, was friendless in the ring for the Rydal-
mere Mile, and the few who specked him on the
tote (newly-arrived immigrants some of them) got
£l2 11s. for each 10s. staked. At the distance it
looked 10 to l on the Queensland filly' Mountain Song,
who was a 2 to 1 favorite, but the imported
chestnut stuck to bis job much more tenaciously than
his appearance and the forlorn odds suggested, and the
Queenslander lost by half a length. She is a nice-
looking bit of stuff who will do better with a few
more gallops, but it is a pity the winner is not in
one of the big handicaps. He is obviously a good
horse.
Polycletan landed a big stake for Dan Lewis's
stable when he outstayed Sunburst and Giggle in the
first division of the Ilighweight Handicap, for he was
backed from 20 to 1 (in places) to 4’s; Matthews,
one of the few plucky ringmen on Sydney courses,
laid £lOOO to £5O. For a horse who beat Bally-
mena in a middle-distance handicap, at a difference
of a few pounds, a week before the M.L. gelding
took the A.J.C. Derby, who defeated Purser and
Spearfelt in a 12-furlong event at Rosehill (he had
7st. 131 b. then) and who went on to win the
Metropolitan with 7st. 41b., the Poly crates —Falling-
brook gelding is remarkably well treated by the
bandicappers. He has Bst. in the Doncaster and
7st. 121 b. in the Sydney Cup. Perhaps two miles
is a bit farther than he really cares for, but there
are Randwick watchers who aver that he can stay’
all day. And now that he has outpaced some decent
sprinters (the seven furlongs were covered in lmin.
27Jsec.) he has come into favor for the Doncaster,
especially as his stable-companion Valdoona is reported
to have gone amiss.
Ridden by a more powerful boy than at Moore-
field, Loquat (3’s) lifted the second division of the
Highweight, but Hamilton, a four-year-old black
gelding by Reputation—Cisco Queen, who looks like
developing into a useful plater, made the finish inter-
esting, and Encre, David’s sister, was not far
away. Bardoleur, the favorite, cracked up at the
turn, Royal Dighton having carried him along too
fast for his liking. Royal Dighton is now a very hand-
some horse, but it is doubtful whether he can be
got ready for the two miles on April 13, although
be ought to be fit enough to run a brisk mile in the
Doncaster, in which he has 7st. 101 b. Reports that
Meenah (s’s) had done little fast work kept many
from backing her for the 10-furlong Rosehill Handi-
cap, but Miss Clift’s game filly travelled kindly for
Toohey and was going away at tbe finish from
Solidify and Mount Erin. Solidify, who was piloted
by an apprentice, was many lengths behind the field
during the greater part of the race, and too much
was asked of him in the straight. If the stable
can get hold of a horseman who can ride strong at
7st. 31b., and overcome the colt’s disposition to loaf
for the first six furlongs or so. it mnv take nut the
Warwick Farm Cup on April 3. Vaal (2\s), a
chestnut colt of commanding appearance by Valais—
Galtee Queen, made the others look commoners in
the first division of the Nursery Handicap. Owned by
E. Moss, known for his heavy punting on Stony, the
youngster will assuredly come into the A.J.C. Derby
betting if he winters well.
» * * *
Drongo, who had galloped ten furlongs
on the sand in 2min. IBsec. two days before, was
reckoned a fair thing for tbe £lOOO St. Kilda Cup
at Caulfield, particularly as he had been unlucky
in his two races at Flemington. Seven to two was
the best quote on Saturday, but at the finish
McShortodds was anxious to go on. There was
plenty of money for Backwood (s’s), Spearage, Val-
wyne (both 6’s), Suomi (B’s) and sundry others,
one of the neglected ones being Jackstaff (20’s),
although the old ’un's recent form had been by no
rneans bad. As it happened, the veteran was never
further back than third, and when O’Sullivan applied
the whip he finished too fast for Valwyne and Spear-
age. Drongo, striking trouble, as usual, early in
the proceedings, just missed a place. His per-
formance must have aggravated his party, for he
has been taken out of the Sydney Cup, yet this is
a race that should have just suited the solid plugger ;
last year, when a three-year-old and not quite at
his best, he was a very’ close fourth after Lewis had
been twice disappointed in the straight. The three-
year-old Validus (6’s), another Valais chestnut, won
the South Yarra Handicap, six furlongs, in lmin.
12jsec., and O’Sullivan didn’t exert him over the
lasrbit. It was a performance strikingly reminiscent
of \ aliard’s Newmarket. Perspective, the runner-up,
shaped like a possible winner at Randwick, for
she can be improved. Manacre proved his Fleming-
ton form all wrong when, with 9st. 91b. up, he
cleared away from a good batch of youngsters in
the Orrong Two-year-old. He was favorite at 7 to 4.

“Hasen”: Why don’t the racing clubs
protect their patrons by announcing the ground for
a protest, as well as the fact that one has been
lodged? Recently, when a protest was entered against
Peithias in the last race at Fleinington, his backers
heard Mac Cohen offer “Four to one Wild Oats; I’ll
halve Peithias tickets.” Then O’Solomon chipped in
with “Fifteen bob in the pound Peithias tickets;
five to one Wild Oats.” O’Solomon could do no
business. But returning to the ring later I was sur-
prised to see him laying Wild Oats freely at 3’s.
There seemed to be a mild panic amongst the
previously calm backers of Peithias. I wondered why,
until 1 heard O’Solomon tell a friend, huskily but
quite audibly, of a rumor that the winner’s apprentice
rider had claimed too much allowance. But, also, I
thought 1 saw O’Solomon wink. I stood by my
ticket. Protest dismissed. The evening papers in-
formed us that the protest was lodged on the score
of interference ; and I’m still wondering who started
that rumor about the apprentice’s allowance. I still
think I saw O’Solomon wink. And I’m still con-
vinced that there would have been little laying-off
if backers had been certain of the reason for the
protest.

“Macann”; Until I had spent a day fol-
lowing the hounds with a Victorian hunt club, 1 held
the opinion that this splendid sport ought to be
encouraged in Australia. The red-coated business
turned out to be a cheap kind of artificial nonsense,
with about as much excitement in it as cultivating
PLUS FOUR AND MINUS ONE.
“Tow never see him and his wife out on the same day.”
“ No. I’m told they have only the one pair of knickers.”
cabbages. After leaving our train we rode leisurely
along till we came to a panel in the roadside fencing,
about three feet high. There an army of press
photographers, who had evidently been to a hunt
before, were already in position. We took thrill No.
1 one at a time; those who failed went a little further
up the road and passed in through an open gate.
Once the hounds found a scent, things livened up,
and the game was getting almost exciting when we
struck another fence. Here all hands halted while
a scout went off in search of another easy panel,
which was duly negotiated, the photographers having
again comfortably forestalled us. It would take
more ink than I have to spare to follow the dreary
business right through, but it worked Out something
like this: Fences jumped, 15; gates used, 28; photo-
graphs taken, 694; foxes sighted, 5; foxes killed,
nil. Will any Bulletin reader swap a set of chess
for a hunter’s" outfit ?
No one who had seen them at work was
astonished when the Maoriland eight, the first to
row in Australia, won the N.S.W. champion eights
on the Parramatta River last Saturday, beating Mos-
man by three lengths, with something in hand.
Drummoyne and Leichhardt finished in that order
a long way back, while University swamped. M.L.
sees little eight-oar rowing, and the conquerors of
Mosman had only been boated together for a couple
of months. With a little more experience they would
make a great race of it with the Westralians and
Murray Bridge. The All Blacks showed a beautifully
clean catch, with the weight going on with the
leg drive simultaneously. So perfect was the re-
covery, with every man steady and straight, that
there was no perceptible roll, and the boat ran on
without any apparent check. Mosman, good crew
though they are, had no hope after the first mile, and
their slightly faster stroke —they used 32 as against
the visitors’ average all through of 30—seemed
choppy by comparison. St. Clair, the M.L. sculling
representative, carried off the State amateur sculls
with ridiculous ease, defeating the second man, C.
Lorimer, of Sydney, by 25 lengths. With great
reach and power, St. Clair, though no stylist, can
make his shell travel without noticeable effort. He
was never seriously troubled, though Lorimer battled
on bravely to the finish.

A worthy successor to “Slip” Carr came
to light at the N. S. Wales A.A.A. championships on
the Sydney Sports Ground in H. D. Ferguson, a 20-
year-old member of the East Sydney club. He won
the 100 yards in lOsee., the 220 in 22 4-ssec. and
the 440 in 524 sec. It will be interesting to see
how the youngster gets on with the Queenslanders
Grehan and Parker, who have been running well in
Maoriland ; with Carr out of the game there is no
one else in his class. D. W. McKay, of St. George,
registered new Ma State figures for the broad jump
(23ft. llin. instead of 22ft. 6lin.), and Parker, the
policeman, cut 29 l-ssec. off the previous State record
for a three-mile walk, 22min. 45 l-ssec., while
Winter, the Olympic champion, got to 4jßft. 9,jin.
in the hop, step and jump. Not so good as his
Paris achievement, but better than those of the
winners at Antwerp in 1920 (47ft. 7in.) and at
Stockholm in 1912 (48ft. 54in.).

Schlesingcr gave the crowd a surprise on
the final day of the M.C.G.’s tennis tourney, which
spread itself over a week, by obliterating' O’Hara
Wood in the final of the singles, 6 —3, 6—o, o—6,0 —6,
6—l. Wood had previously defeated the in-and-out
Hone in straight sets, but his form against Schlesinger
was very poor. With Patterson, however, he bent
Hawkes and Hone after a tough go in the doubles,
9—ll, 6—4, 6—B, 12—10, 6—2. Young Haege
was in evidence again. In the final of the under-21
singles he took matters easily, reserving himself for
the special singles, in which, by beating Dr. Noske,
he won his second championship in one day. Cricketer
Hendry appeared as a tennis winner, too —he ran off
with the C-grade final.

“Past Grammar”: As was here forecasted,
the British Football
Association has been
unable to induce the
big proprietary clubs
to release their high-
priced stars for the
Soccer team about to
visit Australia. Of
the side as first cabled,
only seven are First
Division playess, five
coming from the
Second and the balance
from the twin Third
Divisions. The only
regular first-eleven men
of the seven first
leaguers seem to be
Spencer, of Newcastle
United, an inter-
national half;
his club mate Seymour,
an outside left for-
ward ; and Foreshaw,
a Liverpool centre for-
ward. Later news sug-
gests that the latter
is not coming. The
most striking feature
of the selection is that
only two of the 15
Northern clubs, of the
22 in the First League,
have contributed play-
ers. Indeed, of the
old and famous Lan-
cashire clubs, Liver-
pool is the only one.
Blackburn Rovers, Bol-
ton Wanderers, Ever-
ton. Preston North
End, Manchester City,
names to conjure witii
in Soccer history, are
missing, as are others
of the great Northern
and Midland clubs.
Nevertheless, profes-
sional Soccer has
reached such a pitch
of perfection in Britain
that the combination
of the visitors will
probably be superior to
anything we have yet
seen in Australia.
A painful impression that at least one of
the “fighters” was looking for a soft place to fall
on pervaded the small audience at the Uren-Pelkey
engagement at the Melbourne Stadium. In the
eleventh round of a trying business Pelkev, who is a
Filipino, collected a couple of blows on the body and
went down. Rising at “nine” he took» delivery of
a punch on the jaw and dropped again. The
full 10 seconds had been counted when he rose and
walked briskly to his corner, precisely as he did in
Sydney opposed to the same man. 'He needed no
assistance on leaving the ring. If the affair can oe
regarded as a fight it was a very uninteresting one;
if it is better classed as vaudeville, both performers
are dashed bad actors.
De Leon, another Filipino, has a real appetite for
stoush. While Pelkey was going through his tire-
some act at Melbourne, De Leon, who is a bantam
was knocking skin and hair off Harry Gordon at
Sydney Stadium. Poor little Gordon took a dreadful
hiding before the police stopped it in the sixteenth.

“Tren ’; The bidding for footballers that
caused so much scandal in Melbourne years ago, when
the League and the Association were at open war will
certainly recommence now that the two bodies have
smashed their agreement and resumed hostilities.
Under cover of the truce. League teams enjoyed the
club-loyalty and harmony that the flat rate of
payment brings. Carlton, the only club to continue
paying big money for big names, finished low on the
list because of a woeful lack of enthusiasm on the
part of men who didn't get the big money. Now
the flat rate is in danger, and stars are on the
market. Reputed League champions with no great
wish to leave their present teams, but a fixed pur-
pose to amass much cash while the collecting is
easy, are seeking inducements from Association com-
mitteemen for use in the right quarter. Two-ten
for a strenuous Saturday afternoon, many grumble,
is not nearly enough; much more cash and beer
are to be had for an easy game in the bush. Associa-
tion people have decided that their shortest cut to
revenge is to carry off prominent League players, and
they have already captured several of the best. So
footballers will soon be able to dictate their own
terms again, and the game threatens to sink to the
level of pony-racing.
“Shrewsbury”: “T.V.T.’s” statement that
the English R.U. controlled the travelling arrange-
rs for the All Blacks (B. 12/3/’25) is at variance
• mt e j^ s °f. the original agreement as published
in M.L. and British newspapers. The English people
certainly mapped out the itinerary, and no doubt
suggested hotels, but these, with all other details as
to travelling and accommodation, were considered and
agreed to by the M.L. authorities before the tour was
commenced. As to the trip to France not being
made by aeroplane, I can only say our own news-
papers published long screeds about an alleged trip
of this sort, including the fact that the unexpected
weight, of the players necessitated the use if an
extra plane. Some journals went so far as to
publish photographs of a thing that “T.V.T.” says
chdu’t happen. As to hotel accommodation being
only fair,” it must be pointed out that not every
hotel cares to put up teams of travelling athletes —
Sydney hotels included. Further, with wide experience
of football travel in England, Maoriland and this
country, I have never heard even of one which sup-
plied special food “suited to men playing football,”
and am puzzled to think of what that food consists,
other than the good, plain tucker which is the
standard of every decent caravanserai. Yet again, we
read in the cables that the All Blacks were given
special accommodation at such expensive winter
resorts as Bournemouth a week before their important
fixtures, such as the match with England. As to
the whine about third-class train travelling, one can
only say that the vast majority of England’s popu-
lation travels third-class as a matter of course, and
has done so for many years. This includes such
allegedly swank teams as those from the great Uni-
versities. First-class passengers are mostly Americans
and other inflated visitors, or the newly-rich. Any-
way, third-class accommodation on the big English
lines has nothing to learn from the best of our
first-class stuff in Australia.
* * * »
The Englishmen concluded their tour
rather ingloriously with a 10-wickets’ walloping at
Adelaide. The State put its best team into the
field, but Gilligan tried to do without Hobbs and
Sutcliffe, and the handicap was too much for a side
with so many passengers to carry in the batting
department. Winning the toss, the visitors batted
first, and made a wretched showing. Sandham, who
opened the innings, and whose wicket was the last
to fall, compiled 59 laboriously in just about 3
hours, but he got little assistance save from Hendren,
whose bright 38 included five fours, and Tate, whose
30 included three fours and a six. G. Palmer and
Arthur Richardson, with 4 wickets for 50 and 5 for
42, were the bowlers who had most to do with dis-
missing the side for 179, the smallest total scored
against any of the States.
South Australia started a bit shakily, losing A.
Richardson and Gun with hardly a dozen on the
board. After that things improved materially. V.
Richardson and Pritchard added 80 before the captain
was dismissed for a useful 37. Pritchard’s was an
even more vigorous display; his 87 included ten
fours and a six. The Englishmen’s total was passed
with only four wickets down, but the real thrills
were still ahead. Rundell and Rymill, coming to-
gether, pasted the bowling all over the field. The
former had put up a spirited 90 before he was
caught in the slips off Tate; the latter went to
146 before he ran himself out through being a trifle
too venturous. The quality and power of his hitting
are best gauged from the fact that he took less than
three hours to get his runs. Grinunett (39) bright-
ened up things at the close. Tate was the most
successful bowler, with 4 for 105; six others were
tried with scant benefit to their analyses.
England started their second venture 264 behind
—and that was the precise figure they were destined
to reach. Yet Whysall (101) and Sandham (64)
gave the visitors an exceptionally fine start, putting
166 on the board before being dismissed in quick
succession. After the first-wicket stand, nobody
reached double figures except Hendren (59) and
Tyldesley (14). Grimmett was the destroying angel
this time. lie took 7 for 85, and A. Richardson
secured the other 3 for 86. The Croweaters were
left with one run to make to win, which was duly
obtained off Howell’s first ball —leaving the innings,
one might hazard, the absolute shortest on record.
Aniong the casualties on the English side were a
pair of spectacles for the debonair skipper. Consider-
ing his season’s form with the bat, the wonder is
this hasn’t come sooner.
“Midford” : George Giffen is down in the
sporting reference books as having been born on
March 27, 1859, but the veteran, who is on the eve
of retiring from the Adelaide G.P.0., is quite em-
phatic, according to the Registeb, that this is a
mistake and that he is two years younger than the
printed word has had it for so iong. If this is
sc. and seeing that, according to the same books,
the great all-rounder first played for S. Aus. in 1876,
he must have begun his career in big cricket at the
age of 15 —surelv the most notable of all his records.
Even “W.G.,” I have an idea, was 16 when his
achievements first won him a place in a “Gentlemen
of England” team. Has any cricketer in the world
bloomed as early as Giffen, on his revised birth
record ?
* * * *
“Slip”: Passing along a ribbon road in
a Perth suburb I interrupted a single-wicket match
at an exciting stage. Tbe stumps at on- ;nd con-
sisted of two rusty kerosene-tins, and at the other
of a big stone dug out of the side of the road.
“What game do you call this?” I inquired of the
bowler, a perspiring urchin of about eight. “Cricket,
o’ course,” he replied scornfully; then softening,
“I’m playin’ England.” Pointing to the nipper at
the wicket, whose hair! stuck out in a tuft through
his broken boater hat, he added enlighteningly,
“That’s ’Obbs.”
A LITTLE TOO HIGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. F. C. Toone, the manager of the M.C.C.
team, in a farewell message to the Board of Control
fairly dripping witii treacle, remarks that to win
games is very nice, but to lose them in battles of
true sportsmanship and come up smiling is still
nicer.”
Whatever be the game whereat you're meeting
Opponents, when ’tis proved you cannot win
’Tis fine to show that you can take a beating
With gameness and, if possible, a grin.
Intrepid spirits no reverses crush,
But oh! beware of overdoing the gush I
One dlde must lose—a thing that’s clear as dinner
Ale-—when the rubbers to a finish go.
Well for the loser who can grip the winner
And honestly felicitate the foe.
But to suggest you really like being whacked
Is unctuous flapdoodle—that’s a fact.
Shades of past giants oil old fields contending! -
Grace, Harris, Stoddart, Murdoch, Darling, Trott -
Say, can you picture one of these descending
To this unquestionably greasy rot ?
They fought to win, whatever was the cost.
And didn’t pretend they liked it when they lost.
Farewell, then, Gilligan and Co. ! Not quite up
To England’s hopes, though sparkling now and then,
Withal you put a good and plucky fight up
And took your medicine like sports and men.
We liked you for it. You’re departing soon ;
Until you’re all aboard best muzzle Toone.

Milk at night.
Milk is known as a food of especial
benefit to all. Yet to many it proves
difficult of digestion: more so when
taken at night. This is because the milk
forms into indigestible curds when it
meets the natural acid of the stomach.
If the bed-time milk whether for
child, invalid or athlete is made into
Benger’s Food this formation of tough
milk curd is avoided.
Two tablespoonfuls of Benger’s with
a pint of fresh milk becomes a pint of
delicious food cream, pleasing to the
taste, soothing to the stomach, sleep-
inducing, and highly nutritive.
Benger's Food is sold by Chemists, etc., eoerywhere.

THE INKY WAY.
. Uramoa”: TV. H. Graham, for 40 years assistant
editor, leader-writer and other things on the Christ-
church Press (M.L.), died a few days ago. His ready
pen used gallons of ink in keeping the Massey
Government afloat.
A N.S.W. South Coast pioneer who mixed many
callings successfully was the late Iviama native,
! w Harvison. In 187 S he took on the Moruya
1JN.0.W.) LVamink H, and combined journalism, horse
lacing, auctioneering and cow cockying till Abraham
gathered him to his bosom at 77.
. TVhatsthis”: After refusing several lOin.
cigars from the Yankee millionaire K. TV. Scripps,
who is touring in the yacht Ohio, one Melbourne
scribe excelled himself. “His father,” he wrote,
was a newspaper proprietor, but he points out with
pride that his grandfather was an Englishman.”
. sub-editor to succeed Dr. Sheehy on the staff
of the Sydney Catholic Press is a Bendigo
native, Frank O’Loghlen, who learned the business
on the Bendigo Independent. Followed a long spell
in Bathurst, where he held a job on the Advocate ;
and latterly he had been editor of the Dubbo
Despatch.
Amity”: Henry Brett, veteran M.L. journalist and
proprietor of the Auckland Star, has turned author
in his leisured old age. His book, “White Wings,”
deals with the vessels that brought the early colonists
to Maoriland, and the experiences of the journalists
of those days in securing the latest information. As
Brett always had a passion for accuracy, the book
should stand as a fine historical record of pioneering.
“Kyda’ ; There was for years a cherished item
pasted on a pillar of the reporters’ room of the
N.Z. Herald at Auckland, until a wowserish director
chanced across it and insisted on its being scraped
off. It was a birth notice, and ran thus
"One June 11, at The Parsonage, Waimoana, to
the Rev. John Pennington and Mrs. Smith—a
daughter.”
After managing the Sydney Worker for eight
years, Albert Hineheliffe has retired. Born in the
Cold Country, he was caught by Australia when a
yearling, and began life as a shepherd boy in
Queensland. Later he worked as a comp, on the
Darling Downs Gazette, under Traill, who later
edited The Bulletin for a few years between the
first and second reigns of J. F. Archibald. In
1890 Hineheliffe helped in founding t,he Queensland
Worker, published as a monthly. For these and
other activities Labor elevated him to the Upper
House in 1904, and he voted for its abolition in
1922.
“P.X.”: Tom Coombe, who died at Perth a few
days ago, was one of the backers of the Barrier
Miner, of Broken Hill, in its perilous infancy. The
time came, however, when he and his co-guarantor
got cold feet over the paper’s independent attitude
towards the big mining cos., and, suddenly with-
drawing their support, nearly committed infanticide.
Fortunately the paper had by this time acquired a
strong financial head in a good backblocks Austra-
lian, O. Von Rieben, and to the surprise of every-
body the child was saved to grow into something
very lusty.
“Seebee”: When Jack Edgar was the star reporter
of Melbourne Evening Standard, Sam Whittaker, chief
of staff, sent him to Frankston to see if Chief
Justice Madden, who was rusticating at his country
home, would comment upon the upsetting by the
Privy Council of one of his decisions. Of course
the C.J. refused, but Edgar didn’t come back empty
handed. Somebody had whispered to him that a bull
had chased ’s’Onor across a paddock and that the
Judge had gained the fence and “won by a coat-tail.”
“It wasn’t a wasted day,” was Whittaker’s comment as
he read Edgar’s half-col. description of the thrilling
chase. And Madden used to smile as he nodded to
Edgar every time he met him in the street afterwards.
Edgar, who afterwards joined the Argus, would have
gone far if typhoid had not cut him off.
Fitchett, president of the Methodist Ladies’ Col-
lege at liew (Vic), was handed a bouquet by the
Methody Conference the other day for his work as an
educationist and character-builder. Incidentally he
was complimented on the literary status he has
attained. Fitchett said that he had found literature
a recreation. That may be so, but probably he has
not such pleasant recollections of his experience of
running a daily paper. For a time he was editor of
Melbourne Herald when the McKinley crowd took it
over just after the death of the Daily Telegraph.
TV. T. Reav served under him for a while before
taking his place when Sam Winter regained control.
As a writer Fitchett has been more an echo than a
voice, but a rather pleasant echo that has made
many explore for the voice.
“P.X.”: Following the water-waggoning of Tommy
Walker, Speaker of the Westralian Assembly, in the
Eastern States, a story is being printed teiling how
Tommy went West, young man. According to this
tale, when the bottom fell out of things for Tommy in
Northumberland (N.S.W.), he crossed to W.A. to edit
the Sunday Times. Actually the counterpart of the
Nationalists of to-day found Tommy so embarrassing
in Sydney that they sent him out to Broken Hill to
fight for a perfectly hopeless seat, and when it was
over Tommy was not only well and truly licked, but
stranded also. Then his party at Broken Hill
did exactly what his party in Sydney had done—put
its hand in its pocket and sent him on. To Walker’s
great credit he made good ; and there isn’t a water-
waggoner in Australia who is entitled to be listened
to with more respect.
“Seebee”: Tom Gilchrist, Clerk-Assistant of Vie.
Assembly, who is accompanying the five members of
the Parliamentary Board on Handling Grain in Bulk
to N.S.W. on March 23, was formerly political
roundsman for the- Argus. When the publishers of
the Australasian and the Age w r ere hauled to the
bar of the Assembly in 1899 and ordered to pay
£lOO each as “fees” for contempt in publishing and
commenting upon the report of a select committee,
Gilchrist gravely asked George Turner, who was then
Premier, if he would take the Wilson-Mackinnon fine
out in “Encyclopaedia Britannieas” ? The Argus was
then co-operating with the Times in trying to trade
off the ponderous tomes in sets. Turner was tickled
at the idea, but the Standing Orders Committee took
the matter out of his hands by deciding that the
£2OO was a perk to which Upward, Sergeant-at-
Arms, was entitled. So Upward got the coin, and
Gilchrist, 25 years later, collared the job Upward
would have liked better. Upward died while he was
a Senate table-officer.
“Crotchet”: After holding on to the skirts of
the S. M. Herald for over 30 years, Gerald Marr
Thompson is about to let go and take a little trip
to England. Everyone connected directly or indirectly
with musical and dramatic affairs in Sydney know 3
the dapper, courteous, little gentleman who, holding
I pince-nez in fingers, looks so appealingly at the
prima donna or the leading lady. And a right good
fellow, too, is Gerald Marr, with the best qualities
of his English ancestry I first met him some time
in the mid ’eighties, when he was raw from the old
land, and newly attached to the D.T. We shared a
tent at a military encampment, detailed by our res-
pective newspapers to describe an elaborate “sham
fight.” We swapped ignorances and made up for
what we didn’t know in the affairs of Mars by
reporting what the officers didn’t know. I recall
vividly Thompson’s horror and indignation at having
to make his bed for the night on a bundle of hay
and a couple of horse-rugs. Perhaps it was a bit
stiff on a new chum, but he made the best of. it,
as he has ever done, and soon worked himself into
the texture of our “rough island story” with genial
courage and philosophy. In or about 1890 he took
over for the Herald the work of looking after music
and the drama that had been done by old Mrs. Carl
Fischer, whose personality made subject matter for
Phil May’s pencil. Although not a skilled executant,
Thomspon is an accomplished musician, with all
the musical lore to be found in Grove’s dictionary
at his pen’s point—and probaby more. He is brother
to the late Dr. Ashburton Thompson, who in sombrero
hat and poncho landed in N. S. Wales
from Queensland, where he had seen Government
service, also about the mid ’eighties. The Doctor
became a notable personage in the Public Service, an
expert in small-pox and bubonic plague, and eventually
head of the Public Health Department. Gerald Marr
plans to return to the State after about six
months’ absence.

By slipping the strop through the razor head and moving it to and

Just think of the blade economy that the Valet provides.
There is no removal of the blade either for stropping or cleaning.

account of its power and penetration, is quite as

“Kid Boots,” having its first Australian
run at Adelaide Royal—indeed, its first run
anywhere off Broadway—starts with two
advantages over other recent shows. It is
not about a working girl marrying into the
dollarstocracy. And it has not a meaningless
title of the “Hello” or “Good Morning” type.
It is of the class of “Going Up,” though
without the stroke of genius which there
made the sentimental hero the leading com-
edian also. “Kid Boots” resembles it in the
heavy wagering on a match, golf this time,
the heroine’s hand to go as the prize, and
in the watching of the match by an excited
crowd, with runners bringing interim news.
The “book,” by McGuire and Otto Ilarbach,
is all about golf, and the eight scenes are
all in and about a club-house. The hero is
a young millionaire posing as the club pro-
fessional, and he loses the all-important match
through using an untrue ball meant
by Boots, the caddie-master, for the other
fellow’. But, of course, the fraud is exposed,
the cup renounced, and the girl handed over.

Brian Strange (Roland Ward) tells Lady

Allen and a big handsome American new-
comer, Jean Newcombe, a lady doctor who
manhandles him cruelly. Appealing little
Josie Melville is the least reticent heroine
that ever lived; her emotions, whether of
love or jealousy, are obvious to and freely
commented on by all-comers. Adele Crane
both looks and sings well as the object of
her jealousy. George Vollaire is too much
the complete gentleman as the supposed
hero; he needs to let himself go. Gaston
Mervale, Field Fisher and other good men
are more than competent for their support-
ing parts. Joseph McCarthy’s lyrics sound
good when heard and Harry Tierney’s music
catches on rapidly. The scenery is delight-
ful, the costumes are gorgeous. And it will
have its reward; for though not as arresting
as “Going Up” it is well in that class.
* sk * *
“The conceited man stinks” is an Oriental
saying which may be applied to the central
figures in the two comedies that divide the
evening into unequal parts at Sydney Cri-
terion this week. It is the inability of both
parties to detect their own perfume which
causes all the trouble. In Barrie’s “The
Twelve-pound Look” the vanity of the suc-
cessful Sir Harry Sims drives his wife to
“save up” until she is able to buy a type-
writer, when she leaves him to earn her
own living; he is happy in the belief that
she has left him for some other splendid
lover until she disillusionises him; and the
curtain falls with his second wife inquiring
about the price of typewriters. In “Mr.
Pirn,” by A. A. Milne, the conceited man
is a country squire round whom a domestic
circle revolves with the inevitability of a
planetary system, until an eldefly passer-by
with a bad memory upsets the force of gravi-
tation by letting drop that he has just re-
turned from Australia with the first hus-
band of the conceited man’s wife, supposed
long dead. He remembers later that he has
got hold of the wrong name, but in the mean-
time tlie conceited man’s universe has been
shattered and has to be remade in the last
act by the sacrifice of large chunks of his
self-esteem.
* * * *
Henry Latimer, as the conceited man of
the curtain-raiser, burlesques his part nearly
to the point of buffoonery; but C. M. Hal-
lard in the second play is subtle and con-
vincing. Irene Vanbrugh, as the twice-
married woman who has plumbed the depths
of man’s egregious self-satisfaction, puts up
with her second disillusionment with tol-
erant good humor. The performance of these
two is a highly-polished piece of art. Dion
Boucicault is a lovable old dear who wan-
ders in and wanders out in a cloud of
whiskers, oblivious of the consternation his
doddering memory has caused. Janet Eccles
and Roland Ward arc two spirited young
things who have much love to make and
make it passing well; and Mrs. Robert
Brough is a capable Aunt Julia. Ethel Wel-
lesley is a sparkling first wife to Henry Lati-
mer in the curtain-raiser, and Phyllis Best
is a suitably down-trodden second.
Maurice Moscovitch is still busy demon-
strating in “The Outsider” at Sydney Royal
that a man may be a supremely successful
healer without any of the training and
acquirements that give him the right to hang
his shingle in Macquarie or Harley streets.

At Sydney Opera House “Mr. Battling

“Wildflower,” though well into its fourth
month at Sydney Majesty’s, shows no signs
of wilting or running to seed.
There is a touch of the circus about the
aerial gymnastics of Kay, Hamlin and Kay
at Sydney Tivoli. Following the custom of
the trade, the most ridiculous-looking of the
trio is the best. Gertrude Mitrenga and
Errol Addison are the finest exponents of
the classic dance seen here for many a day;
and the Two Rascals have revised their
songs and chatter and continue to draw
in even the passing policeman from his beat.
Irene Magley, who was the first to advise
Sydneyites to “Cut Yourself a Slice of
Cake,” is giving her breezy manner an out-
ing in songs with a kick.
If Fullers’ New Theatre, Sydney, doesn’t
buck up, the annual Sunday-school concert
at Mangrove Swamp will beat. it. There is
one exception to the general dulness: George
Wallace has evidently had a heart-to-heart
talk with his company, and it is putting
much better work into this week’s revue,
“At the Cross Roads.” Marshall Crosby's
fine baritone, as usual, wins half the battle.
From Friday next onward, till long past
the season for consuming hot-cross buns and
prawns. Wirths’ Circus will be berthed at
the Sydney Hippodrome, and already a thou-
sand uncles are asking a thousand nephews
if they’re sure they wouldn’t like to go.

Will Ashton’s monologue entertainment: —
Will Ashton has been industriously seeking the
same sovt of weather in various parts of Europe,
Africa and Asia, and the meteorological record of
his wanderings is now on show at the Hordern Gal-
leries, Sydney. He uses the formula of 15 years ago
but with a firmer hand. Applied to his old stamping-
ground, Paris, the method is brilliantly successful;
but he missed, or his brush libelled, the soft Spring
days which make the far wir.g of the Louvre a
palace merging into dream while the near end re-
mains solid and abiding. And it was not the
weather but a certain heaviness in the paint that
makes his fountain at St. Peter’s, which most people
know is robed in tender spray, look as ethereal as
a model in plasticene. No. 56, “The Blue Bay,” is
a sparkling picture, and so is No. 6, “Canal Labia ;
but the artist is more at home in the clean sun-
shine of Seville and of Holland than in the trucu-
lent dazzle of the Cairene afternoon ; and in “Mount
Lavinia, Ceylon” (40), his failure is no more com-
plete than that of thousands of others who have
tried it before him. It is rather in the mosaic of color
than in arrangement of form that he excels, and about
a score of laughing canvases attest the fact. “Notre
Dame” (31) and “Avignon” (52) are, however, mono-
tones with a red skirt and a red door to hold the
roving eye. In 34, “The Grand Canal,” the houses
are alive, but are all engaged in an unseemly
struggle to get into the foreground at once. Several
compositions have already been improved by the
red tab in the left-hand corner.

The performance of “Twelfth Night,”
which opened the Allan Wilkie season at
the Melbourne New Palace last Saturday,
was a robust interpretation with too much
emphasis thrown on the comedy aspects.
Wilkie’s own interpretation of Malvolio was
on grotesque lines, an obvious play to a
gallery which had a large smattering of
youngsters. The liner points of the character
of the man who, mentally and morally the
superior of the wastrels who work for his
undoing, is unbalanced by his own conceit,
“MR. BATTLING

so that he becomes their victim, were
neglected. Malvolio was just the conceited
fool who deserved the misfortunes that fell
upon him, and he carried none of the sym-
pathy that should attach to the steward in
his humiliation. The method, with the stress-
ing of the comedy by a good deal of “busi-
ness,” naturally helps the youngsters who
are there for mental culture to bear the load
joyfully. Augustus Neville made a workman-
like character-sketch of Sir Toby Belch, and
Hamilton Henry’s Andrew Aguecheek im-
proved on acquaintance, until towards the
end it was worthy of the best applause; but
Milton Sands can only be regarded as a
disaster as the clown, Feste—a part given
him. no doubt, because of his ability to
warble the ditties. That clown, a delightful
opportunity for the few who can play it, is
a hard proposition for the man who can’t.
Kiore King made Maria the lively young
woman she ought to be; and Jean Athol as
Viola was charming and reasonably effective,
although amateurish. Miss Hunter-Watts
(Olivia) is letting her heavy staginess be-
come more and more pronounced. She deals
out lines, with excursions into the graveyard
for some of her tones, as if it were all a solemn
duty; and it is difficult to get the feeling
that she really loves anyone. Ellis Irving
gave a manly rendering of Sebastian, and
Claude Sounder presented his bouquet of
poetical lines well, without putting much
life into the passions that Duke Orsino is
supposed to feel.
Allan Wilkie, given a rousing welcome
back, stilled the applause at the end of the
performance to blend into his speech of
thanks the announcement that at Easter-
time his company intends to depart from the
straight course of Shakspoare by staging
three classic comedies —“School for Scan-
dal.” “She Stoops to Conquer” and “Lady
Windermere’s Fan.” These will be grafted
into the company’s repertoire. He likewise
intimated that he hopes to add two new plays
per annum to his repertoire, so that in eight
years he will have achieved the record of
having staged every one of Shakspeare’s 37.

In a vague sort of way “Betty,” who is
at present keeping the dust off the seats at
Melbourne Majesty’s, has been given notice.
“Primrose” is under rehearsal, and as it
took four people to make the piece—two to
write the “book.” one the lyrics and the
fourth the music—it should be a “class”
show. Anyway, the usual announcement
that the settings are lavish and spectacular
and the costumes gorgeous gives the impres-
sion that “Primrose” is no modest flower
blushing by the river’s brink.

America and England continue to find
one another’s better points at the Melbourne
Royal, where Joan Crossley is now in the
part which Beatrice Day took during the
opening week. Gladys Webster struck anew
publicity line by getting herself bitten by
a tiger cub the other day. but she still man-
ages to contribute to the cheerfulness of
“So This Is London!”
There is a hint of the early close of the
“Cappy Ricks” season at the Melbourne
Athenaeum. The success of the production
has brought good fortune to Ward Lyons,
who is to go to London and re-create the
name-part in the foggy city ; and the manage-
ment’s desire to get him over there as early
as possible is the reason given for the hinted-
at close. The sudden exaltation of an Aus-
tralian mummer long doomed to wanderings
on the minor stage to the position of star in
a London production must be unique in Aus-
tralian theatrical history.

Last Saturday “Cinderella” said a bright
good-bye to the New Princess’s in Melbourne,
and gross darkness has fallen upon it for a
space. As to what gross darkness is The
Bulletin’s best authority is an old Ballarat
“local” preacher. “Friends,” he said, “you
know what darkness is. Well, gross darkness
is one-hondered-and-foorty-foor times darker
than that.”

Melbourne Bijou audiences have taken Wee
Willie Lancet to their hearts. The success
of Wee Georgie Wood in his child sketches
is responsible for Wee Willie’s appearance
in similar stuff; and, if his performance in
some respects falls short of that of his pre-
decessor, the midget is a more believable
youngster. In spite of his 29 years he has
the legs of a kid —it was Georgie Wood’s
legs that most indicated his real age—and
it is very hard to believe that he is not a
youngster in his teens. Stiffy and Mo have
taken their broad-comedy effects to some-
where “In Spain,” where things happen that
would considerably surprise the Dons and
hidalgos of that romantic country.

“The Lights of London” are twinkling at
the Melbourne Majestic. George R. Sims’s
drama makes a good film, the incidents being
elaborated in a manner impossible in an
ordinary stage production. v ‘The Tenth
Woman” is the other main bill. Pola Negri
stars in “The Forbidden Paradise” at Hoyt’s
De Luxe, Hoot Gibson providing subsequent
excitement in “Hit and Run”; and .Tack
Dempsey is shown in another of his “Fight
and Win” pictures.
The first of a series of c’oncerts under the
auspices of the University Conservatorium
was offered last week at the Melba Hall; and,
with Goll, Heinze and Hattenbach mixing
the musical cocktail, a programme was ren-
dered which gave the series an excellent start.
Debussy’s rarely-heard piano and violin
sonata in G Minor was a choice morsel of
the evening. The Brahms Op. 101 in C
Minor was a confusion of strident sounds in
the first movement, but compensation came'
later with very delicate treatment of the
theme. Beethoven’s Op. 97 in B Flat was
the popular success.

Statler Sisters, posers and dancers, brightens

About a family party:—
Oils and water-colors by Alex. Kerr and sculpture
by Margaret Kerr are on exhibition at Melbourne
Athenaeum Hall. The paintings are undistinguished,
and some of them amateurish; nevertheless, earnest
work is reflected with some success in such items as
“Waterhole,” “Rain Cloud” and “The Valley.”
Amongst the sculpture the proposed memorial to
Adam Lindsay Gordon strikes rather a fine note;
it is by far the most intriguing example of the
lady’s work.

CARRYING A GOOD THING TOO FAR.
ARTIST (to N. Pekk, who has come to see
portrait of his wife for the first time):
“It’s going to be even better than this.
You shall see, sir! I’ll make it a speak-
ing likchess.”
N. PEKK: “Oh, n-n-no! If you please, I'd
much rather you didn’t!”
“Flaming Youth”: Ward Lyons, who is
now Cappy Ricks at Melbourne Athenaeum
and is to make the part in London, has had
some previous visits to metropolitan theatres
sandwiched between adventures in country
towns and the suburbs. He was stage-
manager for the George Willoughby co. which
gave the public what it Avanted, including
“The Kelly Gang,” at the Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, at the latter end of 1914; Jack Kirby,
who is also going to London in search of
further fortune, and Jean Robertson (now
with Moscoviteh) Avere both with the show
at the beginning of their theatrical careers.
And—an interesting addendum to a recent
discussion on former stage salaries —Miss
Robertson’s screw was £2 10s. per week.
That Avas all she received, too, when she
went with the co. to Westralia. When she
protested that she could not possibly man-
age the trip on such small money she was
told that as a beginner the experience would
be invaluable to her, and that argument pre-
vailed.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : An absence of prelimi-
nary boost in Melbourne about Wee Willie
Lancet rather incensed the little man. He
stands something over 4ft. in his boots, and
looks much more like a real kid than Wee
Georgie Wood did; but he is a more ver-
satile and experienced performer. In 1910,
when lie was 14, he made his first appear-
ance at the Argyle, Birkenhead (Eng.), as
an acrobat, and his “variety” runs to broad
comedy sketches and female impersonation.
Seven years ago Ben Fuller tried to get
him for Australia, but he was booked ahead.
During the war lie was twice called up for
service, but, the British Army being Avell
fitted with mascots, he Avas excused when
he showed his size in the recruiting offices.
With this record it was rather annoying
for the 29-ycar-old man to find himself press-
noticed as one who was “working Avhen lie
ought to be at school” or described as “an
evidently well-brought-up boy.”
“Charlik’s” memories of Gilbert:—
Neither the music nor the libretto of “The Grand
Duke,” the final effort of Gilbert and Sullivan, reached
the standard which the great collaborators had set up.
The critics agreed that the book was “labored,”
and that Sullivan’s music lacked the spontaneity and
melodic beauty of former compositions. All the same,
the thing is superior to many comic operas by other
authors, and it is to be hoped that some day it
Avill complete the set, Avith “Euddigore,” in a G. and S.
revival in Australia. There is a superstition that it
is unlucky to bring theatrical business on to the
stage. Very few plays dealing with it survive. The
principal characters in “The Grand Duke” are
members of an opera do., travelling in an .insignifi-
cant German State. During rehearsals we players,
appreciating the wit of the dialogue, would laugh,
and Gilbert frequently remonstrated. “Please don't
laugh” he Avould say. “If you do, you may be
certain the audience won’t” ; and so it proved. Most
of the fun which was delightful to us in the
business Avas not understood, and what Ave thought
would be received Avitli a roar Avas passed over in
silence. 1 had a song describing a manager’s diffi-
culties Avith his company. We thought it droll, but
the audience didn’t. Near the end the three prin-
cipal male performers—Barrington, Passmore 1 and my-
self-—had to enter clad in solemn black. We were
“officially dead,” and this helped to kill the piece.
Afterwards, G. and S, quarrelled again, each blaming
the other for the failure. Incidentally, I asked Gil-
bert Avhy he called the character I represented “Dum-
kopf” (“Fathead”)? He replied, “Why, aren’t you
a theatrical manager?”
“Topee”: The ukulele and the steel guitar
have become the Hawaiian national instru-
ments in comparatively recent years. I saw
no signs of either during a six weeks’ stay
at Honolulu in 1876. The ukulele is actu-
ally the Portuguese machette, much used in
Madeira and the western islands. Nearly all
the American whaleships that used to call
at Honolulu carried “Kyar”-guese amongst
their crews, and these may possibly have
left some specimens behind. The whining
horror known as the steel guitar could only
have emanated from the country which has
become crazy about the saxophone.
“R.K.D.N.”: One wonders, after reading
The Bulletin par. (12/3/’25). whether the
alterations made in “The Outsider” by
Maurice Moscoviteh would be approved of
by the author. Miss Brandon’s play had
quite a respectable run at the London St.
James’s two years back, and the Russian
actor was not then in the cast. Neither did
lie appear in the American production, in
which, by the way, Ragatzy was played by
the late Sam Mackay’s son-in-law, Lionel
Atwill. remembered here as a promising
juvenile lead in “The Whip.” It would
be interesting to know whether the present
“Outsider” differs from the English and
American versions.
“Hamfat”: The Belle Bilton romance (B.
12/3/’25) had an Australian setting. When
the Clancarty family discovered that the
young Lord was hopelessly gone on
Belle, they sent him on a trip to
this country with a tutor, Geoffrey Robin-
son. But Clancarty converted Robinson
to a belief in Belle, and the wedding took
place directly after the pair returned to Eng-
land. Clancarty was a nice boy in those
days. I can remember his delight in the
milking of the cows at Ashworth’s dairy at
Waverley (N.S.W.), and the bonhomie with
which he paid a kiss for a glass of milk —he
had gone with me (aged five) to back an
order for poultry and cream. His marriage
with Belle Bilton set a fashion in the peer-
age, and there are crusty old members of
the nobility who curse him to this day.
“Minim”: Though “His Excellency” lias
not been done here (B. 5/3/’25), Australia
has heard some of Osmond Carr’s comic-
opera music. He provided the score for
“Morocco Bound” —probably the best thing
he did —for which some sprightly lyrics were
Avritten by Adrian Ross, the “book” being
by another hand. Ross and Carr were jointly
responsible also for an excellent burlesque
of “Joan of Arc,” in which Arthur Roberts
and Charles Dauby (here with the Gaiety
Co.) put in some fine comedy work.
“L.H.P.”: “The Two Gentlemen of
Verona,” revived in Melbourne, was first pro-
duced in Australia at Melbourne Royal on
.Tune 3, 1859. The cast included" G. V.
Brooke as Valentine, and Ellen Mortyne as
Silvia. George Ireland, for many years a
prominent amateur, made his first profes-
sional appearance as Eglamour. George was
the father of Harrie Ireland, long a member
of the Bland Holt Co.
“8.V.E.”: I don’t doubt that Maggie
Moore played a mouth-organ in “Struck Oil”
NOW, WHAT DID THE GIRL MEAN?
JOHN : “Yes, I write verse occasionally, you know, but I tear it
up as soon as I write it.”
JILL: “Just fancy! But there—I always thought you were clever!”
(B. 19/2/’25), but the instrument in the
usual Punch and Judy show was (and is)
known as the Pandean pipes. “8.5.” gets
his information from woodcuts and the like.
I got mine direct from an old chap who
played the Pandean pipes 60-odd years ago
with a P. and J. show in London. This
veteran, by the way, is a living example of
the horrors of the Queensland climate; he
is 93, and 57 years have been spent here.
Only to-day he rode 12 miles to the mailbox
to bring my Bully.
“Lysander” : An interesting member of the
Allan Wilkie co. is Stanley Love, a young
Englishman, who found the job of Anglican
parson in Australia cramp his style, lie
sought the kindly refuge of the stage when
the limelight of a court case became an em-
barrassment. starting with a walking-on part
in a Hugh T. Ward show. He played minor
roles with Mulcaster during that mummer’s
season, and then joined Wilkie. His clerical
training gave him a knowledge of how to
use a naturally good speaking voice, and
his experience in chanting a service stood
him in good stead when he bad to sing in
antiphon with Ellis Irving in “Cymbeline.”
“Goldilocks”: The luck of E. J. Carroll
has been consistently good. In his hands
ventures which few other showmen of his
tonnage would have touched have turned up
trumps —witness the “Gappy Ricks” experi-
ment at Melbourne Athenaeum and the
Hawaiian entertainment, which seemed the
sort of novelty that might run for a few
days and was a money-spinner in Melbourne
for several weeks. The Carroll enterprises
are growing, in Queensland especially, where
the firm is interested in show-places in all
the principal towns. But E.J.’s luck gave
him a nip in one instance. A manager,
about to start upon a near country tour,
assailed him with a story of hard luck and
good prospects, and extracted a tenner which,
he declared, was all he needed to reach the
good prospects. He wrote back glowing let-
ters about his success, and mentioned that,
the Carroll tenner seemed to have been a
talisman; but the only reference to repay-
ment was in his third letter. “I attribute
all my good fortune to the fact that there
is Carroll money in the show,” he said, “and
as I don’t Avant to part with my liick I hope
you won’t mind if I don’t return it.”
“Peter P.” : Why do we never see the name
of Gwen Dorise on the playbills nowadays?
A favorite in melodrama, the lady showed she
was capable of other things when she got her
chance with the Firm in “Damaged Goods.”
And talking of “Damaged Goods,” it is
strange that Brieux’s other well-known play,
“The Three Daughters of M. Dupont,” has
never been seen here—in a “commercial”
theatre, at any rate. It has far more drama-
tic interest than the talky “Damaged Goods.”
The 1918 revival at London Ambassadors,
with Ethel Irving and C« M. Hallard in the
leads, lasted 159 nights.
“Hamfat”: One of my enjoyable evenings
in London was
filled in with a
visit to the Ele-
phant and Castle
Theatre, wher e.
“Tommy’s French
Wife” Avas played
by a company
known to the audi-
ence as ’Arry, Bill
and Daisie. The
house became bois-
terous at every
striking exposition
of goodness or evil,
and then were,
heard the voices of
the ushers calling
for “Border, genT-
men, please!” En-
thusiasm reached
its limit when the
villain—a stage
doctor, who had
been offering to
commit murder and
other crimes all the
evening suddenly
recalled that the
ethics of the pro-
fession did not
permit him to de-
stroy the sight of
the hero, upon
whom he Avas to.
perform an opera-
tion. In the tumult
the lady next to me
withdrew a lump
of toffee from her
mouth and hurled
it at the doctor's
sister, who had
been recommending
the blinding. It
missed the villain-
ess but lodged on
the back scenery,
which was sup-
posed to be a study
when it wasn’t a
hospital vestibule,
and remained there
till the end of
the inspiriting performance.
“Cfesar’s Ghost”: Some day I expect to
see a prompter come right on to the stage
to deliver a forgotten line to the offending
mummer. Such an incident would only he
a little more absurd than the off-stage read-
ings, plainly heard by the audience, so com-
mon to-day. The art of whispering a line
so that the “prompt” may reach the player
but not extend beyond the footlights is evi-
dently dying. In old-time shows it was not
thought essential, except on first nights to
have a man constantly “on the book.” An
actor now in Melbourne was once slated
by a manager, his employer, when he put
the responsibility for a hitch upon the
absence of the prompter. “I pay you to
know your part,” thundered the manager.
It seemed a good opportunity, and the mum-
mer pointed out that the great man did not
pay him—there had been no ghost-walk for
weeks. “Well, then,” retorted the man-
ager with dignity. “I owe you to know your
.part!” That finished the argument.
“E.T.” : Following William Archer’s lead,
another critic-playwright lias launched a suc-
cessful piece in London. This is W. A. Dar-
lington. of the Datt.y Telegraph, whose
farce-comedy, “Alf’s Button,” is now in the
bills of the Prince’s. The author has already
scored with the story in book-form, and as a
film in its latter guise it got as far as Aus-
tralia. Prominent in the cast as the Slave
of the Button is versatile George Ide, who
was the Cassius in an Oscar Asche produc-
tion of “Julius Caesar” here.
“T.P.”: When a visiting singing-master
cheerfully dictates to my young school hope-
fuls the words of their next song, I invari-
ably scan their “copyin’-down books” for
howlers, and am seldom disappointed. The
very latest is another insult to Ireland. The
opening of “Eileen Alannah” appeared as “I
lean a ladder, I lean a saw.”

THE choice of a dentifrice
is no small matter. It will
make all the difference to the
well-being of your teeth and, con-
sequently, to your general health.
Ask your Dentist what he recom-
mends. He will tell you Kolynos
because he knows its wonderful
efficiency and that—unlike so many
—it is entirely free from all grit.
Grit wears away the enamel and
speedily brings pain and decay.
That’s why you mud be so
careful. Take your Dentist s
advice and start using Kolynos
now. Pleasant, economical, effi-
cient, it will keep your teeth in
perfed condition.

Days that fill you with blissful content —that make

wonderland,
VIA
The Canadian Pacific Railway
All your dreams will surely be fulfilled —your dreams of a
glorious holiday, spent either in a Bungalow Camp in the
Rockies, way above the clouds, or in a luxurious hotel in some
other beauty spot—if you travel by this great route.
Through tickets for the trip are obtainable in connection with
the Canadian-Australasian Royal Mail Line _ to Vancouver,
whose quadruple-screw Motor Passenger Liner “Aorangi,
together with the favorite s.s. “Niagara,” afford an unrivalled
service.

Commonwealth 6 per cent.
Loan for States
£5,400,000
The interest is 6 per cent, per annum and a bonus or discount
of £l is allowed on each £lOO subscribed.
Any person may pay money into the Loan by lodging the sum at
any Bank, State Savings Bank or Money Order Post Office, and in
respect of each £99 lodged will get a Commonwealth Bond or
Inscribed Stock for £lOO.
The interest of 6 per cent, per annum will be paid half-yearly for
a period of five or ten years (at the option of the subscriber to be
exercised when filling in his application) and at the end of the
period of five or ten years, the subscriber will be repaid £lOO in
respect of each £99 originally paid by him into the Loan.
Subscribers have the option of lodging the whole amount at
once or making payment by instalments as follow:
25 per cent, on or before Ist April, 25 per cent, on or before
Ist May, and 49 per cent, on or before Ist June.
When the whole amount is paid up on or before the Ist April,
the interest will run as from the date upon which the money is
lodged by the subscriber at the Bank or Post Office, as the case may
be. So that where money is falling into the hands of an investor
at any date he may re-invest it in this Commonwealth Loan without
the loss of a single day’s interest.
Persons who hold securities of Victoria, South Australia,
Western Australia or Tasmania, maturing up to the 30th June,
1925, may surrender their holdings and in exchange will get bonds
or stock of this Commonwealth Loan. The interest at 6 per cent,
will run as from the date of maturity of the State securities.
In addition, persons who so convert their holdings will be paid
a cash bonus of £1 on 15th May, 1925.
It is most important to note that State Income Tax cannot be
levied on the interest.

William C.: “Peace” article wants to go
through the wool-press... .H. Mack: Certainly you'll
support the ’bus if you think it is better to put
money into somebody else’s pocket rather than your
own Gerald D.: Off our beat 0.8. A.: Bumps
worse than the tram cars that are sent out to
the Sydney suburbs when they get too violent for
George-street.... Law: Sorry, but we can’t advise
y0u....T.J.; “Woman Pays” is a faded bouquet....
Docent: Thin gruel. It is worth only a dozen lines.
Crosscut: Good swing ■ but it calls for a bit more
sandpapering. Too many lines have been too obviously
dropped in to make rhymes R.M.8.V.: Claim
worked out. You’re not a bad digger, though....
C.F.R.: Not bad jingle; beaten only by a nose....
Bernard F.; Sorry, but don’t quite follow your
argument... .E.G.A.: The mirth is of the heavy kind.
... .Wanderfau: The mere description of a place is
not likely to carry enough interest Sixteen: You
have a long way to go. The verse is very crude.
Read the best you can Giron: Very ragged stuff.
R.V.L.: Not nearly Rosella: An old theme
and not well handled... .S.V.D.: Not enough in the
yarn... .John P.: “The Wanderer” is a very common-
place sort of straggler James H.: The idea is
good, and deserves better handling. Try again....
R.A.S. : Nearly Alan W.: That coal hulk is one
of the most regular visitors at this office; and it
doesn’t improve with age L.J.C.: It has a little
ingenuity, but only strings out commonplaces....
Gerald H.: Very poor T.N.C.: Stirring as a saw-
dust epic of the adventures of a sand-hill E.E.D.:
That method of telling a yarn is bad ; and you have
very little yarn to te11.... J.J.M.: Falls heavily over
its own feet Kunai: Too slight M.H.H.: Noth-
ing there Augustus W.: We like the new and
joyous note:—
Love Serenade, with your Veil so blue,
you smile at me with bewitching glow;
you give me Love and hope as well;
I adore you my sweet world Blue Bell,
the Sun and Moon belongs to you,
and the stars show that you are true;
When I am downhearted and out
I to you, my Love Serenade, will shout.
But when Clouds come over your face
with Silver lining and a Rainbow lace,
then I look through your tears of Rain
towards my lucky star. I would Reign.
I would make it a paradise my home,
Gold and Rainbow color would be my Dome;
O Love Serenade, you would be my Queen;
what might have been if your Veil were green 1
. . . .Wyndon: Same old sunset in the “balmy breeze.”
. ...J.8.8.; The verse is thin and weak, but there's
a hint of something better .J.F.G.: Says nothing
fresh... .J.E.P.; The little lament doesn’t move us.
.... Rouseabout: Too old a theme.... Arth. L.: ft
would have been too lumpy for use if sent along at
the time ; now it is years behind.... H.K.W. ;• Doesn’t
strike us hard enough... .Doris M.: Even sweet seven-
teen can hardly excuse that... .Mac: Lame exposition
of a small matter A. J.H.: Feeble little flutter
Clara N.: The mirth is hard to find... .A.C.H.: As
wooden as a crutch.... Len M.: As tame as the office
cat.... Scribo: The “Sol” sketch is thin....O.W.
(Ipswich): Misses D.P.F.0.: Don’t know quite
what it means ; but it is unusual:—
How joyous is
The rolling, bowling, frolicking of the waves
As they rush ; —and then wash upon the shore,
How merry they are!
As they play their games like saucy knaves
Without e’er a murmur for more.
Oh! but just list
To the mumbling, grumbling humans that we are
As we strive after gain (’tis no doubt our bane)
Without hut a thought for “e’er more.”
O let us be wise and do not despjse
The beauties that God gave us here.
... .I.H. (North Sydney): The monotony of the
refrain chokes it... .A.M.S.: You ought to learn more
about verse before you write it.... Mary M.: The
translation is hardly worth a place.... Madsudan:
Too extravagant and hysterical.... L.W. (Boonah) :
Shows only a trace of thought... .AV.D.F.: “Con-
fession” doesn’t read true.. .Garvoc: He went away a
young saint and returned from the war to make some
mildly rude remarks. Doesn’t seem an excuse for so
many foolscap pages R.D.: “The Intruder” is far
too long and not very convincing... .G.M. (Oamaru) :
Not enough interest... .Leslie T.: Doesn’t make a
yarn... .M.G. (Coff’s Harbor) : Not the meat for this
pink sausage... .W.E.8.: “The Brute” is too confused
an animal for us Hugh K.: Little interest at this
time of day... .Z.V.W.: Not up W.J.T.: The
Spanish sailor says nothing fresh... .Frances T.:
“Contrasts” begins well; see if you can’t keep up to
that level. The others miss, but not by miles....
Alisco: P00r... .Craigie B.: We must find room for
one verse of your soul-throb:—
She’s sailed away into the glowing
The pearl within my heart;
With her parents going
To visit foreign iparts.
. ...L.R.D.; That’s a quibble. It is plain that if
there were no “secondary” industries in Australia
we should be an exporter, not an importer, of popu-
lation ....Muttonbird: Pretty dull. And why don’t
you write of the little things you know about ?....
Adam S.: Missed the ’bus. And, anyhow, it was
overcrowded. Croton: What you most need to do
is to comb out your brains before you start to
write. You’ve got good stuff, but in no order.
. ...E.J.W.: You have made poor use of your
material... .W.M.S.: Your ear wants tuning....
Dingo: Not good enough. A Bulletin article has to be
packed tight with hard facts; yet they must be
presented in such a way that the public will forget
they are hard facts while it is lapping them up.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
H.D. (East Kimberley): Moving pictures of life
in the great North regretfully refused... .V.D.:
Three are the feeble efforts of immaturity; the
fourth is quite a finished work. Your rapid develop-
ment is highly commended—also darkly suspected.
....Miss C.: Far too many studio tricks and too
little observation in them.... H.W.T.: As strange,
unexpected and original as an election manifesto....
G. 8.5.: Frankly, we don’t think it would be worth
your while to take such lessons. You are young
and may get over it by less expensive means....
W.H.W.: The death-cart removed it....A.F.: More
malformations. .. .11.P.M.: A passable gag, but with
no visible means of support... .A.L.C. and F.W.W.:
They don’t find us in.

“Hamer”: Another of the best-known of
Melbourne pubs, Hosie’s, is going to exalt
itself. An 11-storey building (that is
about all that can be got into Melbourne’s
height-limit of 130 ft.) is to tower where
now stands the old-fashioned tavern which
was regarded as quite a swell building when
Melbourne was a village. Hosie’s at one
time set out to emulate Young and Jackson’s
in having a picture gallery, but the artistic
side of the business was not persevered with.
* * * *
“Weaver”: The Germans still maintain
their reputation for inventiveness. Recently
I analysed some sample German fabrics and
found the weft entirely composed of paper
“yarn.” A class of weave was adopted to
bring up the warp threads and cover the
weft or filling yarn. While the goods were
somewhat stiff and “boardy,” there is no
reason why the cheap innovation should not
work on non-washables like webbings, etc.,
in which the harder-twisted warp threads de-
cide the strength.

“5.N.0.”: At Paddington (Sydney) Police
Court a woman running a grocery sued an-
other of her sex for a long-overdue account,
and secured judgment. Shortly afterwards
the defendant came to light with an un-
stamped receipt for £2, given her by the
judgment creditor several months before. The
fine just about soaked up the proceeds of
the previous verdict. Surely in such cases
a Court might reasonably hold the informer
equally responsible with the informed against
unless the information is laid, say, within
a month of the issue of the unstamped
receipt.

“The Rumpus” : A bright idea in crooked-
ness came to a W.A. man. lie attended the
drawing of one. of the numerous motor-car
raffles, and, taking notice of a ticket-holder's
name and address (chosen at random among
the also-rans), ducked out, hopped into the
unguarded car and drove away to inform his
victim that he had won the car. He was
depending on- the naturally impulsive gener-
osity of the Australian to shell out a couple
of quid to the person first in with the glad
news and the prize. But his luck was out.
His man was away at work and heard the
false tidings by ’phone only.
* * * *
“Hopalong”: The turtle-soup cannery on
North West Island (Q.) has finished opera-
tions for the season ; this year’s output was
about 46,000 tins, some half of which has
been taken oyer and shipped from Glad-
stone. _ As the greater part of the plant has
been installed only a few months, even
better results are anticipated next season.
At present demand has outrun supply; one
TJ.S. firm alone would have taken 30,000
tins if it could have got them. Besides the
turtles that supply the company with its
raw material, over 300 were shipped alive
from Gladstone to the southern cities.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: The N.Q. mail and passen-
ger air service was recently extended from
Cloncurry to Camooweal. ADe Haviland 4
machine left Cloncurry at 6 a.m., and with
a passenger and sundry goods (including
281 b. of butter and 301 b. of ice) arrived at
Camooweal two hours ten minutes later.
After a shivoo in honor of the new transport
service, another passenger and bag of mail
were taken on. and the journey back was
started at 30.10. Cloncurry being reached at
just on 1 o’clock. Under'the old regime 10
days was considered good time for the there-
and-back trip; by ’plane it took just seven
hours.
* * * *
“Nitric”: The sugarmill at Plane Creek
(N.Q.) has been selected as the site for a
£50.000 plant for the manufacture of power
alcohol. At last the State Government is
being backed by the Federal one; the
molasses hitherto wasted or put to the poor-
est uses will now be converted into alcohol.
But the molasses itself will not provide suf-
ficient raw material, so crops such as cassava,
sweet potato and arrowroot will be planted.
A bonus of 4d. divided into three portions
has been asked for —Id. for denaturing, lid.
for the grower and lid. to be held by
the company to cover any error in estimates.
If labor gives the new industry a chance it
ought soon to push out a good many thousand
gallons of foreign petrol and, besides pro-
viding a new source of employment, make
Australia a lot safer in time of war.
* * * *
“C. Mac” : Australia’s wretched telegraph
service (B. 19/'2/’25) is unlikely to be satis-
factory as long as the Department’s miser-
able system of . paying for overtime is con-
tinued. Before a telegraphist is entitled to
claim overtime he has to work 37 minutes,
and has to exceed that before he can claim
for one-quarter hour. In other words, he
must work three-quarters of an hour for one-
quarter’s pay. If the job takes under 37
minutes—and a score or so of operators can
get through an enormous amount of business
in that time —the Department has the ser-
vice gratis. Owing to understaffing, the
operators have to work so hard in their ordi-
nary shifts that they cannot give anything
like their best in overtime, so the service
slows down anyway. But when, in addition,
there is unremunerated time to be killed, the
dashes chase the dots over the wires like
aldermen running away from bribes.
* * * *
C. A. L. Morant’s word in reply:—
“Tee” attacks me for saying before the Tariff Board
that Australian timber is quite unsuitable for fruit
eases (B. 26/2/’25). He goes on to say that West-
ralia for the past 12 years has been using jarrah.
But evidently he is speaking of fresh fruit, whereas
I was speaking of dried. London advices are unani-
mous in emphasising the necessity of Australian
dried fruit being packed in attractive packages, and
our competitors, both European and American, use
good-quality white wood cases. Dried-fruit packers
would gladly use Australian timber if suitable, but
the only native timber that can in any way be con-
sidered as such is specially selected Queensland hoop-
pine, and the price for this is prohibitive. South
Aus. dried-fruit packers have repeatedly tried using
locally cut timber, but always with unsatisfactory
results, and they have reluctantly come to the con-
clusion that to get timber of suitable quality and
accurately milled it is necessary to import it. Aus-
tralian timber is generally used for the local fresh,
fruit trade in bushel cases, but here there is no
foreign competition to be met,

To all lovers of outdoor sports, a dip in the roaring breakers on
a summer s day is indeed romance. Next day the sunburnt, blistered
hands and scarlet face are painful realities. Why suffer such distress
and disfigurement from sunburn when it can easily be avoided by
US Rexona Soap when you have your shower and then applying
a little Rexona Ointment, the cooling, soothing and healing balm?
If you want to make doubly sure of avoiding sunburn, also apply
a little Rexona to the exposed parts. This prevents both the action
of the salt water and the sun on the most delicate skin.
If this is done there will be no after effects from exposure to
the sun, no regrets after a happy day, for the skin, soothed by the
wonderful influence of Rexona, the Rapid Healer, will quickly
regain its normal temperature and comfortable coolness.
You will find Rexona Skin and Facial Soap ideal as
a shampoo for the hair after your dip.
Rexona Soap and Rexona, the Rapid Healer, in its
dainty pot, should stand on the toilet table of all who
indulge in outdoor sports.

THE NEW MAYFLOWER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Rum runners landed a cargo of spirits at Ply-
mouth Rock.” —Daily paper.
They drove their prow to Plymouth Rock
Across the wintry sea.
Content to bear the tempest's shock,
These men of sturdy British stock
Risked all for liberty.
They broke the laws that men had made
And dared to take their chance
Where none could make their souls afraid.
Within the dark untrodden glade
They strode in time’s advance.
But fate and change are over all;
New manners make new men.
Earth listens to another call;
And some would leap their prison wall
These days as well as then.
They drive their prow to Plymouth Rock
While wireless signals hum;
The hireling slaves of law they mock
Because they bear a priceless stock
Of red and precious rum!
N.s.w.
C. O. M.
“V. McC.”: Australia’s model boy has
turned up at Chinchilla (Q.). Fifteen years
old, he has been attending the same school
since he was five. In those ten years he
has never missed a day (poor kid!), never
been late and never been punished.
Talking of ancient Diggers. ‘‘.lock” Leach,
recently drafted from Caulfield Hospital to
the Macleod Sanatorium, was one of Admiral
Charley Beresford’s matelots at the bombard-
ment of Alexandria. At 54 he reversed his
tally and enlisted in the tunnellers. He is
rising 64.
Dr. Sidney Fielder, who had become an insti-
tution in the Gosford (N.S.W.) district, laid
down the pill-box the other day. In an un-
obtrusive way he very nearly worked miracles
in eliminating the mosquito and other disease-
carriers along the mangrove-infested fore-
shores of his circuit.
Like Minogue, his predecessor, Pitt, Vic.
TJnder-Treasurer, has a sense of humor. He
was, therefore, merely tickled when he
learned that a junior in a sub-department of
the Treasury had left a memo, for his chief
that “Pitt, the undertaker,” had rung him
up on the ’phone.
ATc. Richardson, who has captained S.A.
at football as well as cricket for several
seasons, has announced his retirement from
the winter game. His club, Sturt, is top in
cricket so far this season, but is bracketed
with Glenelg, which district has the weird
record of never having won a football
match in its life.
Passed out, at the Launceston Home for
Invalids, George Green, who claimed to be
105. He was a seaman who blew up on the
beach in Hobart many years ago, came to
Launceston, married, and settled down as
a storekeeper. One of his daughters married
an O’Sullivan, of Pollard’s Opera Company.
The old man was hale until 12 months ago,
when the ’flu got in.
AA 7 liile John Macarthur was the pioneer of
the woolgrowing business in Australia, his
wife blazed the way for the amateur pianists.
In a letter written on March 7, 1791, she
mentions that their new house was orna-
mented with a pianoforte belonging to AVor-
gan, the surgeon of the Sirius, which he had
arranged to leave there. She had begun to
study the instrument and had done wonders
in being able to play “God Save the King”
and Foot’s minuet.
“ Japhetli” in search of a grandmother: —
Re the passing of an old resident, Mrs Frances
D’Ariietta, of Punchbowl (N.S.W.), mention is made
(B 26/2/’25) of Captains Rossi and D’Arrietta having
been rewarded for their sendees to George IV. with
grants of land and passage paid. It is said that a
third party (a woman) came with them. Can anyone
oblige with her name, the situation of her grant of
land, or whether she was recompensed with a monetary
consideration? It was said she came from Spain
and lived in Hunter-street.
“Gustave Guttersnipe” : Botany, a thickly-
populated Sydney suburb, has had its ghost
scare. Queer lights were seen flitting across
a large paddock at a speed that seemed to
put human agency out of the question. Just
when people with imaginative minds were
beginning to tell yarns of strange appari-
tions being encountered in the dark, it was
discovered that the paddock was covered with
heaps of broken bottles which reflected the
lights of motor-cars turning a corner on the
main road a mile away.
“A.M. J.”: For years past there has been
a steady removal of houses from Kalgoorlie
and Coolgardie to Perth and the country
districts of W.A. One of the last to go
is the “Old Camp’s” “paper”-house, imported
from England 30 years ago by mining-engi-
neer J. W. Archibald. It was known to every
old goldfielder, with its resemblance to grey
stone. It consisted of several comfortable
rooms and a large hall, the whole bungalow-
roofed. It proved a successful heat-resister,
and the fact of its re-erection in Perth after
30 years is good evidence of its durability.
“Simon” : Robert Harris, whose resolution at
the old Sydney Trades Hall in ’9O was respon-
sible for the creation of Labor Leagues and,
incidentally, the Labor party, lectured in
Ashfield’s School of Arts recently on Labor
ideals, past and present. The veteran, now
over 70, brought along an interesting array
of manifestoes and ukases, plat-
forms and planks long since law. The ideals
of Labor then and now are so different that
he finds himself quite comfortable amongst
the local Nationalists, whose League he
helped to form on the conscription split
in ’l6.
“Wart”: Launceston (Tas.) has a pub
which has kept the same name for a hundred
years. When Gov. Arthur first visited
Launceston, in 1824. he stayed at “The
Camp,” which seems to have been the Bris-
bane’s first name. Host Jim Quigley lias
just become possessed of a document (dis-
covered among a mountain of papers when
the old gaol was demolished some years ago)
authorising the transfer of the “Brisbane
Hotel.” It was dated July 26, 1825, signed
by P. A. Mulgrave, J.P., and mentioned that
the rental was £l5O per year. That fixes
the change of name to within a few months.
Since Gov. Arthur stayed at the Brisbane
practically every visitor of note has put up
there —Prince of AVales, Gov.-Generals and
State Gov., and various other celebrities.

Lower the roller enclosures of
the New Studebaker Duplex. In
30 seconds—without getting out
of the car —it becomes a snug,
comfortable enclosed car.
Raise the enclosures and you
have an airy open car!
The airiness—the freedom —the
conservative weight of an open
car, plus the protection of a
closed car —yet at no greater
cost than a strictly open car!
This dual convenience is obtained
only in the new Studebaker cars,
for only Studebaker builds the
Duplex body.
Power
As swiftly—as smoothly—as a bird in
flight, the powerful New Studebaker
cars negotiate hills, sand, mud and
bush roads with an ease which com-
mands admiration.
That’s because they are powered by the
famous Studebaker six-cylinder engines
—now more powerful
flexible and smoother
than ever before.
The new Studebaker
engines are economical,

Make Peace with
Your Stomach!
YOU CANNOT FORCE your stomach to do work that it is
unable to do. It has been tried time and again, with always
the same result. The stomach is a good and faithful servant,
but when pushed beyond the limit, it rebels. Some stomachs
will stand much more abuse than others, but every stomach has
its limit, and when that limit is reached it is a very dangerous
and unwise proceeding to attempt to force it into doing further
work.
THE REASONABLE COURSE, and the most sensible, is
to procure a substitute to carry on the work of digestion, and
give the stomach an opportunity to recuperate and regain its
lost strength.
DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES digest what
you eat, and are the only perfect substitute to take up and carry
on the work of tired, worn-out stomachs. They are natural and
easy in their work and cause no disturbance in the digestive
organs. They contain all of the essential elements that make
up the gastric juice and other digestive fluids, and will digest
any food that a strong, healthy stomach will, and do it in the
same time and in the same way. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive
Tabules are sold in two size tins at 1/9 and 2/9.

Storm Ride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIGH up, stripped boughs bend break-
ing in the night;
A towering wind goes lurching
through the dark.
Wrenched roots lie gaping, burst and over-
thrown,
And black clouds hug the blotched horizon.
Hark
How the slant rain against each roof is
blown.
Ami far away the muted sea makes moan ! .
Who rides along the ramparts of the
storm ?
A phantom wild, begotten of the fray!
’Tis Odin, the All-Father, riding back
Upon eight-footed Sleipnir, gaunt and grey,
Hunting the dead souls through the driven
wrack
Across the heavens with his howling pack!
Odin is out, and with him his lean wolves,
Freki and Gori, fed by his own hand!
lloi! Iloi! The hunt! Behind the hell-
hounds crowd
The few, dim clustered stars. A shadowy
band,
Snuffing the wind and baying long and loud,
They tear the edge of every dumb, dark cloud
Heavy with rain. The Valkyrs rake the
sky, _
Urging their snorting stallions to the race,
Their hair wild-hanging, and their breasts,
moon-white,
Bent over, in the ardor of the chase.
Odin is out-1 The split sky is affright
And naked fury flaunts on every height!
Over the forest and the frowning peaks,
The ridges where the stark pines smear the
sky,
Far. far above the vague plains drowned in
dread,
Speeds Odin’s spectral pack with yelp and
cry.
And as the leaves from barren trees long
shed
Lise whirling up, the pale souls of the dead
Flee on before that flurrying cavalcade,
Wailing a wild immeasurable woe
And filling all the places of the air.
The hunt is up! Ah, whither shall they go?
The hunt is up ! There is a laughter where
The Valkyrs hide their faces in their
hair!
Look to your house, O frightened ploughman,
look
To every lifted latch and loosened bar!
Seek not the rain-ribbed step, but draw
around
The smouldering turf-built fire and hear
afar
The cry of hunted soul and seeking hound —
The backward-driven surge of hellish sound.
Listen, and stop your ears! Oh, take no
heed
Of tapping twig and blown insistent leaf!
Out in the fields, before the first big rain,
Hid you not leave upon the earth a sheaf
For stamping Sleipnir leading down his
train
And in the barn a measure of gold grain?
Look to your crazy door. O ploughman, lest
Some nameless evil fall upon your head ;
Lest when the hunt is over, and the pack
r Along the forest fastnesses has fled
Tou find upon the ashy hearth, a black.
Mis-shapen dog that rubs its bristling back
Along the wall and will not go away!....
At home in Asgard cool-eyed Frigga spins
A web of gold ; but the world’s bastions
quake!
Down on your knees and cry your coward
sins!
Odin has set the jangling skies ashake.
And death and awfulness are in his wake!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Channel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A BREATH came gently from the east,
and the little boat moved forward
with languid grace.
The steersman gave no attention to liis
task. Ilis head drooped ; his lips moved as
if framing thoughts too intense to be entirely
repressed. At intervals, when he looked
ahead and saw the lines of foam that edged
the distant channel, his eyes would open in
a wide stare, his face grow grey, the hand
on the tiller tremble limply or clutch the
slim bar with rigid grip.
A tall man emerged from the little cabin.
He was followed by his son. In height,
figure and dress they were alike. In all else
they differed completely. The father moved
forward carrying a cushion. The son turned
to the man at the tiller.
“Won’t you go and have something to eat
now, Uncle?”
“No, no; not yet. Later, perhaps.”
His tone was gentle, and he tried to smile,
but the words came nervously, and he flushed
as if taken in some unworthy act.
The youth settled down to read. But the
book was dull. Soon his roving attention
alighted on his uncle. All day he had seemed
a little strange. While watching the sports
his interest in the most exciting events had
been rather forced. Even during the furious
whirling contest of the gum-diggers, tliqugh
his eyes were fixed on the flashing spades,
his attention had wandered so that in the
end he did not know who had won.
And now, as they moved homeward across
the broad bay in the beautiful calm of sunset,
he sat in brooding silence, or lifted a face
which, when his glance reached the channel,
turned as livid as the froth that flecked it.
Bid he fear the crossing?
“What an erratic wake, Uncle! Isn’t she
answering?” •
Again that start, the guilty flush, a glance
behind.
“Yes, yes; she’s all right. I just wasn’t
attending.” He smiled affectionately till his
eyes encountered that sinister streak far
ahead. Thesi ""the smile fled before a grey
cloud; his band shook more pitiably than
before.
“Dear Uncle, you look squeamish. The
beat’s been awful to-day. Won't you go
®nd lie down for a bit?”
“No, no., I might later. You can dis-
play your seamanship crossing the channel.”
“Is it risky?”
“Not in this boat. It’s very deep, of
course, and when the tide turns the water
goes out with a terrible rush.”
“I suppose that’s why one finds so little
around the bay?”
“Ah! You search the shores of the bay?”
“At first I liked to, butt I find nothing.”
“Nobody does. Everything is swept to sea.
Nothing comes back.”
“Doesn't the dark come quickly here!”
“It will be very dark crossing.”
“I suppose the wind gives you the direc-
tion then?”
“Oh, no; the wind and currents are always
changing. The teacher at the Maori school
leaves his lamp burning when I am out.”
“That little crippled chap? How romantic
your life is here! We’ve had a great holi-
day. I’d like to chuck everything and come
and dig gum, and live with you always,
Uncle.”
The man’s heart thrilled in its desolation ;
but only a little sound like a moan came
from his lips.
Thickly over the dreaming waters the
shadows gathered. The hills kneeling around
the bay were blotted out. The- youth grew
silent. But presently the commotion of the
channel, no longer visible, came faintly to
their ears, and when he got another glimpse
of his uncle’s face its pallor seemed almost
ghastly in the gloom. A sort of frozen
horror gleamed in the wide-staring eyes; the
man’s agitation was so much beyond control
that the teeth chattered.
From Mesopotamia the uncle had brought
a mysterious malaria, as well as wounds,
but never liked either alluded to. He was
particularly sensitive about the “malaria,”
and allowed nobody to see him during
attacks. But the nephew could not restrain
his sympathy.
“Do go and lie down, Uncle. I’m sure
you’re going to have an attack of—of
illness.”
“Well, but perhaps he wouldn’t like you
steering?”
“Oh, Dad’s all right. Curled up on his
cushions. Asleep probably.”
“And you’re not frightened to tackle the
channel?”
“Since you say there’s no danger.”
“None. We shall cross at its worst, and
the current will be terrific; but a strong
breeze always blows there, and it is delight-
ful to feel haw proudly the little boat rises
to the occasion.”
He rose slowly while speaking, and the
youth took his place.
“Don’t worry, Uncle. Have a good sleep.”
But the man did not even lie down. He
sat on the narrow bunk of the cabin, now
dark as a cave, and leaned forward on the
table, striving to subdue the agitation of his
body. But the longer he strove for calm the
more violently he trembled. After a time he
drew from his breast-pocket a small packet
that lay always against his heart. It held
the last letters of the twin sister who had
been his companion from babyhood till her
sudden, secret and incomprehensible marriage
with a man whom he could not endure sent
him to wander mateless in the Old World.
He said he would be back soon, but it was
seventeen years before he returned. He was
still solitary; and with what eagerness he
now turned to his sister! Always they had
remained a pair of lively children with each
other. But in the hour of re-union they
could only cling together in speechless an-
guish, appalled at the change the years had
made. On him wounds and the ravages of
fever had written their signatures for all to
read; but what could have turned the beau-
tiful sister to whom he had said good-bye
into the haggard women whose shrunken
body, worn features, greying hair and trem-
bling, broken utterance filled his heart, as
he clasped her to him, with a suffering more
hopeless than any it had ever known?
Of her seventeen years of martyrdom a
few hints, delicately, even humorously, ex-
pressed, wei’e all that had escaped into her
letters. They had just sufficed to puzzle
and disquiet him momentarily.
His unsuspecting eyes were suddenly
opened by her tragic death. At last he knew.
Hate filled his life. He thought of nothing
but vengeance; his whole being clamored for
action swift and pitiless. But he could not
bring her only son to shame by an open act
of violence. Patiently, therefore, and with
infinite deceit, lie schemed to bring the object
of his hatred within his reach.
And now, after many months, he had him.
A few yards away. Curled up on cushions.
Alone. In a lonely bay. On a pitch-black
night!
“And I am afraid to strike!” He whis-
pered the words to the darkness.
But was it fear? Had not life already
tortured him to the full, and for so long that
any cessation of suffering must seem like
death? What, then, could he fear? He
cared nothing for himself. The methods of
the assassin were forced on him. And he
willed this deed. Believed it right. A duty.
Strained to have it done.
But murder, cold-blooded and premedi-
tated, is not lightly achieved by a man whose
life has been one long exalted passion for
the noble, and compassion for the weak. The
very thought convulsed him afresh.
“How cowardly I am!” he still whis-
pered to the darkness. “And yet, in battle,
after the first awful moments, no one was
more self-controlled than I. It is not really
I who now falter. My soul urges this deed.
My conscience acclaims it. My spirit wills
it. Only this miserable, quaking, fever-sapped
body recoils as from a crime!”
He began to unfasten the packet. He
knew the letters bv heart, and at the touch
of his trembling fingers every word flamed
forth in the darkness as if written in fire.
Especially those last words, a little inco-
herent from dread of saying too much:
“Above all, dearest brother, take care of my
dear son, who is so like what you used to
be in appearance and disposition. Save him
from inflicting or receiving that terrible
selfishness in the world that preys so cruelly
on happiness and kills it.”
The world that had tortured her through
seventeen terrible years—oh, there was no
mistaking!
And he lay above. Curled among cushions.
Alone. “And I am afraid to strike!”
The weapon was at his hand. It was a
club fashioned like a mere. He had shaped
it himself from a piece of swamp kauri lon°-
ago to carry at the fancy ball he had at-

Have you suspected
your Kidneys?
Are you dragging along day in and day out with a dull,
throbbing backache?
Do you feel lame in the morning, tired all day; suffer sharp,
torturing twinges at every sudden move? Then there’s something
wrong!
You may never have suspected your kidneys, yet often its
the kidneys that are at fault. A cold, strain, or overwork congests
the kidneys and slows them up; poisons accumulate in the system,
and many mysterious aches and pains result.
You may have headaches and dizzy spells, too, with perhaps
some annoying bladder irregularity. Don t wait for more serious
trouble. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They have helped
many Sydney folks. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY
Mr. A. B. Cowell, who lives at the corner of Park Road
and Hardy Street, Mascot, Sydney, says : —“Some months ago I
was suddenly seized with a terrible pain across my back, just
above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought at hrst it
would, but, on the contrary, it got worse, and I was soon so baa
that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled and
even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain, i
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in tact, no
position was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment. I tried different
remedies, but they gave me no relief whatever. One day a
friend suggested I should take Doans Backache Kidney Bills,
and it proved to be good advice, too, for three bottles cured me
completely. I feel splendid now, and my recovery is due solely
to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Four years later Mrs. Cowell says:—“My son is still well,
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills having completely banished all
signs of kidney trouble.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle, or from Foster-McClellan Co.,

DOAN’S OINTMENT.
SYDNEY PEOPLE TESTIFY.
A WOMAN’S WORD.
Mrs. W. Membrey, Como, 79 Sim-
mons Street, Enmore, says :—“For
three years I was a martyr to Piles,
and I don’t think any ailment causes
more suffering and loss of sleep. I
used Pile remedies, and was treated
by a doctor, but nothing gave me any
relief. After so many failures I
thought there was no cure for this dis-
tressing complaint, but I was mis-
taken, as a treatment with Doan’s
Ointment proved. A short course of
this wonderful preparation cured me,
and I advise sufferers to give it a
trial.”
Eleven years later Mrs. Membrey
says:— “Doan’s Ointment cured me of
Piles over eleven years ago, and I
have been free of the complaint ever
since.”
A MAN’S WORD.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street,
Erskineville, Sydney, says : —“I used
Doan’s Ointment for Itching and Fro-
trading Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previously
I had tried all kinds of Ointments, but
they gave me little or no relief. I was
suffering terribly when I first applied
Doan’s Ointment, and had little hope
of it doing me any good, but itssootu-
ing and healing effect was noticeable
almost at once, and by the time I had
used one pot I was completely cured,
* all signs of Piles having disappeared
entirely. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known.”
Twelve months later, Mr. Francis
says ; —“i have not been troubled with
Piles since Doan’s Ointment cured me.’

tended as a Maori chief. Afterwards, be-
cause it was both ornamental and useful for
stunning sharks, he had hung it in the little
cabin. Even now, as the boat gathered her-
self to enter the channel, the club began to
tap-tap against the wall as if impatient to
be used. .
“And I am afraid to use it.
His soul seemed to wrench itself free; to
sit apart from the abject body, appealing,
urging, reviling. But the hand recoiled, and
would not grasp the club. His legs refused
to lift him from the seat.
The minutes were flying. How the waters
raced around the little boat! They must
be ’mid-channel. This was the moment so
long desired, so carefully planned. And he
was unequal to it. Coward !
But ever in the darkness the letters flamed,
and while the soul was denouncing the. body’s
weakness, his eyes, reading them again and
again, seemed insensibly to have absorbed
the very power of which lie had despaired.
Suddenly lie realised that his limbs no longer
trembled. Ilate, cold, triumphant, was
diffusing its energies through every fibre.
Carefully he replaced the letters. Like
an electric light turned out, their fiery lines
faded from his vision. The throbbing ceased
in his brain. Ilis thoughts were clear, his
nerves steady. More impatiently than ever
the club tap-tapped to be used, and, when lie
reached out his hand, seemed to leap with
intelligence into his firm, strong grasp.
Outside the night was almost as dark as
the cabin from which lie stepped.
Lithe, invisible, noiseless as a beast of
prey, he passed forward. His plan was
exquisitely simple and complete. The languid
figure would be induced to lean over to wit-
ness some phosphorescent effect in the water.
Then a swift blow would stun, a firm push
deliver the body to the torrent now rushing
in mad panic from the bay.
But perhaps he would be asleep? Or lie
might decline to rise from his cushions? In
that case— —
Fate anticipated his immediate wish. In
front of him the detested form was drawing
itself up. He saw it slowly outlined against
the sullen waters. Now it was leaning well
out —balancing carefully—stooping—vomit-
ing.
* * * *
Remorse assails murderers. Terrors pur-'
sue them. Especially in the dark. He had
read all that. But why were they nearly all
so stupid? Infallibly leaving some clue to
bring them to the gallows? No wonder they
went around filled with fears! For his part,
though he sat once more in the little dark
cabin, it was not to fortify his spirits but
to restrain their elation.
How admirably he had done it! Not a
cry. Not a groan. The splash lost in the
clash of the waves. The little boat had
seemed to shy like a sensitive mare, to shud-
der from stem to stern, and it was a jiity he
had let the club slip overboard ; but, all the
same, it had been admirably done.
Remorse? Terror? Drivel of fiction all
that!
As soon as he could keep the exultation out
of his voice he would go un and congratulate
his nephew on the skilful way he was
navigating the channel. Night would mask
anything that might remain of his previous
struggle. Morning would find him in com-
plete control of himself, ready to meet any
inquiry about the missing club.
The strain on the boat relaxed. They were
entering calmer water. He must go up at
once. Pity the club had slipped over.
If his voice seemed to sound too joyous
he could explain that his high spirits came
from having got rid of his fever.
But malaria leaves depression, never
buoyancy. Well, whatever it was he had
slept it off. Pity about the club slipping
overboard like that.
He drew back and made a clattering noise.
No need to embarrass the boy at such a
felicitous moment.
The channel was now well in the wake.
The waves were peacefully lap-lapping on
the bows. Away on the hill, where the little
teacher sat among his books, the lamp burned
with a soft, faithful radiance.
He cleared his throat. How would his
voice sound? But he need not hurry. He
thought again of the club, and was conscious
of a little tremor. But the beloved nephew
was saved from that joy-consuming hypo-
chondriac. What a mate he’d make! How
happy they’d be together!
Oh, it was impossible to keep the jubilation
out of his voice; but what odds?
“Cheerio, nephew! How goes it?”
“Oh, you’re awake at last! Our budding
Jellicoe got sea-sick and wouldn’t have you
called. So I took the tiller. You’ll find the
devoted nephew somewhere for’rd —feeding
the fish.”
BLACK WATCH.
In the Delta.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A sound like the report of
a rifle. Sergeant Gibara raised his
head, rose noiselessly to his feet and
slipped a cartridge into the breech of his
carbine.
“Be not afraid, taubada,” said old Sabadi,
“the people are killing a pig.”
“Crack!” Again the report rang out. The
throbbing, sinister note of a tom-tom filtered
through the night,, followed by the whine of a
bull-roarer, and the sonorous, booming tones
of a conch-shell blown three times in quick
succession. There was a short silence; then,
from somewhere in the darkness, a piercing,
agonising scream, half animal, half human,
brought me to my feet with a gasp of horror.
I could hear my cook-boy, a youth from
Eastern New Guinea, whimpering in the
room behind me, and I sensed rather than
saw Sergeant Gibara standing at my side
with his carbine at the ready. For the space
of a minute we stood tense, expecting we
knew not what. Then old Sabadi broke the
spell.
“It is as I say, taubada,” lie said—“the
men are killing a pig in the ravi (club-house).
It is the custom of my people to make a
ceremony when pigs are killed -for a feast.”
I sat down, feeling rather foolish. Gibara
lighted a cigarette with exaggerated uncon-
cern. but I saw that the hand which held
the firestick was trembling. He caught my
eye and grinned sheepishly.
“The old man speaks true, taubada,” he
said. “It is the fashion of these people to
kill pigs in the way they killed their ene-
mies in the old days.”
We were camped in the rest-house at
Maikari, in the Purari Delta. It was one
of those black, opaque Papuan nights,
humid and sweltering, an hour before the
rise of the moon. A hurricane lantern cast
a fitful radiance over the narrow verandah,
throwing odd shadows on the wrinkled face
of my friend Sabadi, the ancient village con-
stable. He had discarded his uniform and
wore the pubic shell and twisted grass
sporran of his tribe. A polished bone was
thrust through the septum of his nose;
around his forehead was a circlet of dogs’-
teeth, and on his breast he wore a magnifi-
cent half-moon plate of glistening mother-
of-pearl. Below us, in the black, evil-
smelling mud, village pigs wallowed ob-
scenely, stirring up the age-old ooze and
poisoning the air.
Gibara tossed the butt of his cigarette
over the verandah rail, and spat disgustedly.
“la, taubada!” he grunted, “this is an
evil place!”
Sabadi grinned, displaying toothless gums
stained, with blood-colored saliva, for he had
been chewing betel-nut.
“It is my home, Sergeant,” he said, and
was the home of my revered ancestors, in
the days when the men of Maikari were
fighting men—mighty head-hunters and
eaters of their enemies.”
“So the people were iaunimanimn ama-
tauna (cannibals) before the Government
came?” I suggested.
Sabadi threw me a sidelong glance. ‘Why,
surely, taubada !” he replied simply.
Gibara shuddered. He came of a Gulf
tribe to whom cannibalism was an abomina-
tion, and who loathed the old-time figlitiiig
peoples of the Delta, man-eaters for centuries
before the coming of the white man.
“Tell me about the old days, Sabadi,” I
pressed. “About the days before the Govern-
ment came and how the Maikari people came
to be eaters of men.”
The old man took a betel-nut from a twine
bag slung about liis neck, bit it in halves,
and, taking lime from the gourd on an ebony
spatula, commenced to chew.
“This is the story I had from my father,
who was an old man and a wise,” he began.
“In the old days there was a powerful chief
in Maikari, and his name was Dohumi. One
day lie took his young men on a hunting
expedition up the river. They were away
many days, and slew many pigs and casso-
waries. Then Dohumi, the chief, fell sick
and died. The young men were sore dis-
tressed. They sat about the chief’s body and
wailed, as is our custom, for they knew that
the chief’s kindred in the village would make
trouble when they returned. And a stranger
came amongst them, and laughed at them,
saying, ‘You are fools, oh men of Maikari!’
The young men were afraid, for they saw
that the stranger was a god—some say he
was Kanibu, the spirit of the mountains;
but of this lam not sure.” _ .•
Sergeant Gibara made a clicking noise with
his teeth.
“This is evil talk, taubada,” he muttered.
The moon was rising slowly, washing the
river and its nipa-lincd banks with silver.
Half-naked figures dodged furtively from the
ravi, and squatted before the rest-house jn
the shadow cast by a giant jack-fruit tree.
Their breast ornaments glittered eerily m
the dim light, and the dogs’-teeth frontlets
about their foreheads rattled as they urged
Sabadi in hoarse whispers to continue.
“And the stranger said, ‘Why do men eat
pigs, oh men of Maikari?’ And one an-
swered, ‘That they may be strong like the
wild boar!’ ‘And why do they eat casso-
wary?’ Another answered, ‘That they may
bo fleet of foot, even as the cassowary is
fleet!’ Then the stranger laughed. ‘Then
cat the body of the chief that you may be
powerful fighting men and terrors to your
enemies, even as Dohumi.’
“So they cut up the body of the dead chief,
at the ankles and the knees and the hips,
as pigs are prepared for a feast. And some
they ate: and some they smoked and packed
in nipa leaves. Then they returned to the
village. The women met them dancing, sing-
ing and blowing conch-shells, and when they
tasted the new food they said. ‘This is good
food; it is better than fish, better than pig,
better than cassowary ! Ia! It is the food
of men!’ ”
The moon rode high, throwing into relief
the squat, nipa-tliatched huts, and the grim
bulk of the ravi stretched above the mud like
a giant, many-legged alligator, guarding the
ancient mysteries of the tribe.
“So it was in the old days, taubada,” he
whispered, “before the Government came and
the police with their rifles. The men of
Maikari had pigs and cassowaries, fish sago
and taro —but their real food was man !
\ cool breeze blew up from the distant sea,
rustling the fronds of the nipa palms. Gibara
sniffed the familiar tang of the salt water.
“la, taubada!” he muttered. This is evil
talk, and Maikari is an evil place. Send
the people home that we may sleep.”
TAUWARRA.
Autumn.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My lady Autumn now draws nigh.
Chill grows the wind and eerily
The trees against a sullen sky
Fling out their ghostly arms.
She wears a gown of trembling gold,
Leaf sandals, russet-brown, are set
Upon her feet, and none have told
The glory of her yellowed hair.
The lane is like a living flame,
The bending fern is all afire;
Since she has crossed it death became
A splendor on the moor.
By slopes of meadow sweet with bloom,
Through purple mists among the hills
She bears her secret in the loom
That weaves her pageantry.
