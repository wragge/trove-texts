Truth in the Melting Pot
One of the most eminent of living pro-
fessors of philosophy, F. C. Schiller, of
Oxford, begins a controversial essay with
this confession :
On almost every question the discussions of
philosophers have become a byword. The most
diametrically opposed views are advocated with
conviction and enthusiasm as the only rational in-
terpretation of the facts. ... Asa class they seem
to be constitutionally incapable of seeing both
sides of a problem at once. Or rather having seen
one side of it, this perception forms a distorting
haze through .which they interpret everything else
into agreement with it.
The ordinary man has had a suspicion that
formal philosophy was mostly fudge, and
cordially endorsed the definition of a meta-
physician as “a blind man looking in a dark
room for a black cat which isn’t there.” The
light literature of several countries reflects
the popular conception of a professed philo-
sopher as a tiresome and foolish person. .
William James, brother of Henry the
novelist, is one of a number engaged in the
philosophy business who are trying to justify
their existence by giving a rational and
practical meaning to philosophic principles.
His Pragmatism followed Professor Schiller’s
Humanism in setting forth a definition of
Truth which strikes one as sensible and work-
able, but which has been ignored since the time
\of Protagoras. That early Grecian was ex-
tinguished by a plausible medicine man
named Plato, who tried to persuade every-
body that man was made for ideas, not that
ideas were made for man and by man. The
misty idealism of Plato held the field for
many centuries, and its supporters of the
present day are bringing all their guns to
bear on the new and deadly foes led by
William James in America, Schiller in
England, and Bergson in France.
S!>
The fiercest attack has been made upon
Jaujes, for his essays are so simple and per-
suasive in style that they make converts
rapidly. By the way, what a pity Henry
did npt collaborate with William when
writing some of his novels ! How much
clearer William would have made that pro-
blem, The Sacred Format! In The Mean-
ing of Truth (from * Dymock’s) William
replies to the attacks on Pragmatism,
and restates. his case in a variety of ways.
That true ideas are those which we can assimi-
late, validate and verify, false ideas those
that we cannot—seems a common-sensible
proposition. Instead of referring back to
some imaginary standard of verity, the prag-
matist would have us go forward to the facts.
Instead of considering whether a belief
squares with some other belief or set of
beliefs, James says that any belief is true so
lpng as it holds good. “All that the
pragmatic method implies is that truths
should have practical consequences.” The
humanists go further and say that the truth
of any statement consists in the consequences,
and particularly in their being good conse-
quences. “At each and every concrete
moment truth for each man is what that
man ‘ troweth ’ at that moment with the
maximum of satisfaction to himself; and
similarly, abstract truth, truth verified in
the long run, and abstract satisfactoriness,
coincide. ”
The earlier logicians searched in vain for
absolutely certain premises from which to
deduce their conclusions. What was theo-
retically the essential condition of truth was
that to which in practice no human truth
could ever attain.
“ As I understand the pragmatist way of seeing
things,” says James, “it owes its being to the
break-down which the last 60 years have brought
about in the older notions of scientific truth. ‘God
geori'etrises,’ it used to be said; and it was be-
lieved that Euclid’s elements literally reproduced
his geometrising. . . . Up to about 1850 almost
everyone believed that sciences expressed truths
that were exact copies of a definite code of non-
hunian realities. . . . Now we hear scientific laws
treated as so much ‘conceptual shorthand,’true
so far as they are useful, but no farther.
James, Schiller and Co. may not have
satisfied all opponents, but they are bringing
about a change with regard to the meaning
of truth which in its consequences may be of
greater importance than the revolution
wrought by Darwin.
Spooks Seriously Considered
In Psyche's Task, J. G. Frazer surveys the
superstitions of the past, and finds that many
of them rendered service to humanity. They
were workable; they held good to their
believers; they were true while they lasted.
It matters not that we do not regard them
as true now. The beliefs we hold may be
equally absurd to the next generation.
In the same way, though the chances of
fake are considerable, the interviews of
Julia with the spooks may be true for Stead.
The extent to which spook literature has
been accumulating of late and the unimpeach-
able character of some of the authors make
the scoffer pause. Hamlin Garland, whom
we have known as a vigorous, open-air
novelist (Rose of Dutcher’s Coaly, Captain of
the Grey Horse Troop , etc.), recently pub-
lished The Shadow World, which he states to
be a faithful record of some marvellous
spiritualistic phenomena which had come
under his own observation. In it he men-
tions a sitting he once had with a young
man wherein the invisible hands removed
his undershirt while his coat-sleeves were
nailed to the chair.
“ Oh, come now, you don’t expect us to believe
a miracle like that, even on your serious state-
ment ?” remarked Miller (a scientist). “I cer-
tainly do not,” I responded readilj’. “ I wouldn’t
believe it on anyone’s statement. That is the dis-
couraging tiling about this whole business: you
can’t convince anyone by any amount of evidence.
A man will stand ou.t against Zollner, Crookes,
Lodge and Myers, discounting all the rest of'the
great investigators, and then crumple up like a
caterpillar at the first touch of the Invisible Hand
when it comes to him directly.
Let us be prepared to crumple when the
Hand comes.
Miss Katharine Bates, who was in Aus-
tralia in the ’eighties, tells the story of her
psychic experiences in Seen and Unseen
(Greening and Co.) with a light touch and a
certain amount of humor. There are a num-
ber of more serious works on the subject
which are criticised from the standpoint of
the Church in the Dublin Quarterly Review for
October’. But by far the most important
contribution to recent spook literature is
After Death — What ? by Cesare Loinbroso
(Sydney Book Club). The English edition
was published on the day before Lombroso
died, and is a remarkable conclusion to the
life work of the great criminal anthropologist.
I thought it my-predestined end and way and
my duty to crown a life passed in the struggle for
great ideas by entering the lists for this desperate
cause, the most hotly contested, and perhaps most
persistently mocked-at, idea of the times
W
Lombroso starts by saying that “if ever
there was an individual in the world opposed
to spiritism by virtue of scientific education
and by instinct, I was that person.” But
certain hypnotic phenomena which mani-
fested themselves in a girl of his acquaint-
ance shook his beliefs and set him at work in-
vestigating further; This girl became a sleep-
walker, and lost the power of vision with her
eyes ; but as a compensation she saw with
the same degree of acuteness at the point of
the nose and the left lobe orthe ear. Her
sense of smell was transposed, and later on
became located in the back of the foot.
Next appeared phenomena of prediction and
clairvoyance.
This was fairly startling, and Lombroso
mentions a number of similar cases. Ex-
periments with the famous medium, Eusapia
Paladino, are fully described, and there is a
mass of corroborative evidence gathered
from ancient and modern sources. The
bare details of some of the incidents, more
or less authentic, are more extraordinary
than any invented ghost yarn ; but the
bald statement does not evoke a thrill.
Herein is shown the superiority of Art to
super-nature ; for there are not a few ghost
stories which would give a brass image the
creeps.
The most depressing part of the business
is that the spirits never seem to do anything
really worth while. Lombroso mentions a
servant drowned near the villa of his master
who reappears by night and rinses the
bottles and water jugs of his employer.
Even Eusapia could not predict the winning
number of the lottery, though she did some
fine work in table lifting and materialising
uninteresting phantasms out of the ether.
If the spooks wish to be taken seriously it
ought to be easy for a gang of them to Work
some ,big miracle, such as shifting a moun-
tain—as the people did by faith in Stephen
Reynold’s story, The Holy Mountain. The
pragmatic method would grant the truth of
the existence of spirits to those who believe
in them. Far be it from us to deny any
,state of ethereal existence; but we would
respectfully point out that, on the evidence,
it is not worth while swapping the present
state for Spookland.
He now publishes a prose description of
the place, in which poetry bursts out at in-
tervals under the strain of enthusiasm.
Across Papua (Angus and Robertson) is an
account of a voyage round and a march across
the territory made by Colonel Mackay in
1906, when he went as chairman of a com-
mission appointed by the Federal Govern-
ment to report on the condition of things in
British New Guinea. This book does not
enter into competition with the Official
Be port, though it gives all the facts neces-
sary to any intending miner or planter who
wishap to get the measure of Papua. The
place is not so black as it has been painted.
“ The fact that odd missioners, officials and
traders have been killed, and in rare in-
stances eaten,” sometimes because they
deserved it, in other unlucky cases because
some white predecessors deserved it, “helped
to supply the color for a painting of this
daughter of the coral seas.” There is now
very little danger of the visitor being eaten.
The natives never did like the white man, as
he is too .strongly flavored with tobacco.
Hop’s cannibals probably belong to some
remoter island.
The march across Papua was a fairly
strenuous one, the Commissioners acquitted
themselves well, and the story of the trip, as
told by the Colonel, is worth reading.
Further information about New Guinea
may be obtained from The Trader , by Cecil
Ross-Johnson (Sydney Book Club). The
author is, we believe, a N.S.W. native, <lnd
his story looks as if it is largely a record of
personal experiences. It is a good yarn,
with plenty of action and horse-sense in it.
Part of the trader’s business, it seems, is to
create wants among the natives. Originally
they wanted little here below; but the white
man has added a taste for tobacco, red
calico, tomahawks and treael#. “Thus we
sought to teach the savage the nobility of
labor, to wean him from that ignoble sloth—
which threatened to keep our hold so
empty.” Some of them have as much cun-
ning as the heathen Chinee. They used to
bring india-rubber to the trader in good-sized
balls, and it was purchased by weight. By
a fluke the trader found that the untutored
savages had been bringing in balls of rubber
with stones in the middle !
Papua
In Songs of a Sunlit Land Kenneth Mackay
printed some staves of respectable verse
about Australia’s tropical dependency :
Broad-fronded palms and regal vines
Hang as a ramee round her,hips,
Hibiscus bloom her hair entwines,
The blood of summer paints her lips.
Her fruitful breasts rise full and round
Free to be woo’d by shower or sun ;
She sits and waits by reef and sound,
A mistress worthy to be won.
The Poems of Oscar Wilde
Six volumes of the new edition of Oscar
Wilde’s works have now been issued by
Methuen and Co. They are sold separately
at 6s. here, and include the Poems, the
original edition of which has been practically
unobtainable for years past. The new
volume in handsome format is cheap at the
price, as it contains The Sphinx , Ravenna
and The Ballad of Reading Gaol, in addition
to the whole contents of the volume of 1881
and most of the previously uncollected
poems which appeared in the limited edition
last year. Amongst the latter was the trifle
first printed in The Centennial Magazine
(Sydney), for which the ynwary proprietors
had to pay Wilde a fancy price :
SYMPHONY IN YELLOW.
An omnibus across the bridge
Crawls like a yellow butterfly,
And, here and there, a passer-by
Shows like a little restless midge.
Big barges full of yellowy hay
Are moved against the shadowy wharf,
And like a yellow silken scarf,
The thick fog hangs along the quay.
The yellow leaves begin to fade
And flutter from the Temple elms
And at my feet the pale green Thames
Lies like a rod of rippled jade. » .
Some of the best of Wilde’s poems have
already been printed bn this page. The two
following appear for the first time in the
new volume :
DESESPOIR.
The seasons send their ruin as they go,
For in the spring the narciss shows its head,
Nor withers till the rose has flamed to red;
And in the autumn purple violets blow,
And the slim crocus stirs the winter snow ;
Wherefore yon leafless trees will bloom again,
And this grey land grow green with summer rain
And send up cowslips for some boy to mow.
But what of life whose bitter hungry sea
Flows at our heels, and gloom of sunless night
Covers the days which never more return?
Ambition, love and all the thoughts that burn
We lose too soon, and only find delight
In withered husks of some dead memory.
PAN. *
0 goat-foot God of Arcady !
This modern world is grey and old,
And whatremainf to us of thee?
No more the shepherd lads in glee
Throw apples at thy wattled fold,
O goat-foot God Of Arcady !
Nor through the laurels can one see
Thy soft brown limbs, thy beard of gold,
And what remains to us of thee ?
And dull and dead our Thames would be,
For here the winds are chill and cold,
O goat-foot God of Arcady !
Then keep the tomb of Hejjce,
Thine olive-woods, thy vine-clad wold.
Bat what remains to us of thee ?
Though many an unsung elegy
Sleeps in the reeds our rivers hold,
O goat-foot God of Arcady !
Ah, what remains to us of thee ?
Ah, leave the hills of Arca ? dy,
Thy satyrs and their wanton play.
This modern world hath need of thee.
Nonymph or Faun indeed have we,
For Faun and nymph are old and grey.
Ah, leave the hills of Aready ! *
This is the land where liberty
Lit grave-browed Milton on his way.
This modern world hath need of thee !
A land of ancient chivalry,
Where gentle Sidney saw the day,
Ah, leave the hills of Arcady !
This fierce sea-lion of the sea,
This England lacks some stronger lay,
This modern world hath need of thee !
Then blow some trumpet loud and free,
And give thine oaten pipe away,
Ah, leave the hills of Arcady 1
This modern world hath need of thee 1
If anyone is thinking of becoming a
journalist in London he should first read
Percy Gibb's The street of Adventure (Heine-
mann). It is the best story of the life of
newspaper men and women yet published,
and we shpuld think thatitisa faithful picture
of modern Fleet-street. The Liberal of the
story is apparently the shortdived Tribune ,
on behalf of which the Rev. Harold Rylett
visited Australia some years ago. One
striking contrast with American stories of
the same kind is that it is free from techni-
calities. There is some advice which any-
body can understand. It was given by the
chief editor to the hero when starting as a
reporter:
“Don’t wear your hair long. Don’t wear a
bowler hat with a tail coat. Don’t use a foreign
word when there is an English one in the
dictionary. Don’t have serious convictions on
any subject in the world. There have beep more
pressmen ruined by serious convictions than by
drink.” “ Are there atiy more don’ts ? ” said tbe
young man. “Yes,” said Bellamy, “Don’t have
any political op nions. A pressruau must write
from a brief, not from his soul.”
It is,- of course, mere assumption that a
pressman has a soul. The Salvation lass in
Phil May’s cartoon knew better. She
asked the man if he was saved. “I’m a
reporter,” he replied. “Oh,' I beg your
pardon,” she said.
In The Danger Mark (Geo. Robertson and
Co.) R. W. Chambers returns to the theme
of The Fighting Ghance, and makes a read-
able story of New York society and an
inherited taste for drink. In these days of
rapid production, Chambers is a record-
beater. Naturally you cannot expect any
innards in a story written at lightning speed.
Ambrose Bierce is being re-discovered in
England, and a new edition' of his remark-
able tales, In the Midst of Life , has just been
issued by Chatto and Windus. Three or four
of these, are amongst the masterpieces of
short-story writing; and once read are not
likely to be forgotten. A later collection,
published in America under the title of Gan
Such Things Be. contains, nothing new in
style and nothing approaching the earlier
volume in quality.
The R.A.S. Annual , compiled by H. M. Somer,
is better than usual this year. The photographs
of stock, etc., are excellent. The book deserves a
wide circulation in the country. • ":. • '■ . -
Australia To-day for 1910 is a fine budget of
pictures?, articles and stpries—oue of the best for
sending to anyone abroad. Louis Esson has a
good article on Australian literature, and William
Moore another on Australian art. There is a
poem by Bernard O’Dovrd which is not a bit like
him. and there is the prize poem by F. Williamson,
which is like most other prize poems. Bedford,
Brady, Dyson, Sorenson and Jose are amongst
the contributors.
COULD I.
Could I butt spell—
Could I butt spell, the world would seem much
sweeter,
And my decisions more infallibell,
And.all my manuskripts would look much neeter—
Could I butt spell!
Could I butt spell! The editorial scratches
Become by that dear art divinely rarer ;
Maybe,’twould minimize rejected batches
Of manuskripts that trouble me and Sarer.
Could I butt spell—oh, dream beyond my cap-
ture !
Biographers would have a tale, to tell
Of ope caught on the crested wave of rapture—
Could I butt spell !
Could I butt spell!—
II always was dead rotten at the game,
And mother says its injuring my fame 1
Ah, well, perhaps the nearing by-and-bye
Will make of me a different sort of man,
When, on the 30th of April, I
Am married to a little maid who can !

Clements
Tonic.
READ THIS TESTHVIONY.
This letter is worth reading upon a fever case from
the pen of the well-known cosmopolitan journalist,
serial writer and traveller , Mr. H. F. WICKHAM,
whose records of travel and adventure may
be read in Australian journals. This letter
was written 'o the Clements Tonic Co. after a
severe atp'.ck of malarial fever in the tropics.
Here is his letter :—
“I have pleasure in testifying to the benefit received from Clements Tonic.
For Brain-fag and Lassitude, from which most brain-workers suffer, I have never
found its equal. For the lingering after-effects of malarial fever, contracted in
tropical countries, it is without a rival. One of the features of malarial fever is
that it often permanently affects the liver. After two severe attacks of this
complaint I thought mine was beyond cure until I was induced by a friend to try
Clements Tonic. This I did, and in a surprisingly short time I attained most
beneficial results. At present, whenever I feel the slightest indication of the well-
known symptoms, I resort to this medicine, and in no case has it ever failed to give
me relief. I recommend it to all troubled similarly.—Yours truly, H. F. Wickham.”

the Summer Months. IT HERALDS HEALTH.

Bonningtons is a special process
for compounding Carrageen or Irish Moss
(Chrondrus Crispus), obtained from the
West Coast of Ireland. The Irish Moss
in its crude state has many uses but it
was left to that skilful chemist—George
Bonnington—to so combine this product
with other ingredients to produce the
splendid chest medicine known as—
BONNINCTON’S IRISH MOSS.
This remedy has a world wide reputation for the cure of Coughs and Colds
and Aftections of the Chest, Throat and Lungs. It has been in constant use
for upwards of 45 years. The most persistent cough will yield to its influence
and be permanently cured. It has proved its worth to other people—let it
do so for you.

VRIOVS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though Nought Abides.
Joy is upon the earth—
Flash of wing and melody—
When the flower has come to birth,
And the green is on the tree.
Then the lad may go his way
With his heart’s own by his side,
And love may say its say,
Nor fear to be denied.
The whole round sky is kind,
And the whole blue sea is sweet,
And a calling in the wind
Puts a spirit in our feet.
And the old man’s limbs grow young,
And the young man goes on wings;
And with lusty throat and lung
The faring fellow sings.
Then dawns are wondrous bright,
And noon of day is brave ;
And the stars that light the night
Kiss their sisters in the nave.
O, the wonder of it.all !
O, the magic more than gold !
And to think that leaves should fall,
Love grow grey and youth grow old.
Hath the bird remembering
Of the green and golden day
When its one-time glowing wing,
Autuinn-hued, is grave and grey?
More than light of plume, perchance,
Is our love serene, sublime;
But Romance is just Romance,
And it passes in its time.
For all the vows we swear—
The love-words true and brave,
The troth of lasting-wear—
We but kiss across the grave.
Leaf of rose and laugh of eye
They are turned, when autumn’s grief
Goes a-weeping ’neath the sky,
Into falling tear and leaf.
Met, in spite of warnings drear,
Let us take what Fate shall send,
And enjoy the moment’s cheer,
And be blithesome to the end.
N.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.
Blind.
Here at the corner of the street —
The stony pavement for my stand—
Where Wealth and Fashion meet and greet
And Youth goes gaily hand in hand,
I've felt Life’s seasons hasten by
Till Autumn flinsrs her leaves behind,
Still sounding to the world my cry—
“ Blind, good people, blind ! ”
But, though my eyes be as the night,
Glad with one black unbroken cloud,
Old Time has brought me other sight
Wherewith to scan the passing crowd ;
And, as the swift years lengthen out,
My heart grows kinder and more kind,
There are so many round about
“ Blind, good people, blind ! ”
I hear men talking as they go;
I hear them laughing as they talk ;
I see beneath the laugh and knosv
What phantom forms beside them walk.
And Fear is ever hurrying by—
A present fear so well defined
Men often stop to curse my cry—
“ Blind, good people, blind !”
Lti«t lingers leisurely at hand,
And wantonness is ever hear ;
Crime quickens at low Greed’s command,
And Death too often follows Fear.
Cunning, Deceit and Treachery
With Hate a-maiiy victims bind ;
Oh God ! that I could make men see !
“ Blind, good people, blind ! ” >
From me, Pain has no hiding place;
And, walking side by side with Care,
D sease goes by, with eager face, /
To greet the spectre called Despair.
And Mockery, the cynic sprite,
Conies sneering with his scornful kind,
Till, sick at heart, I mourn my plight—
“ Blind, good people, blind !”
But simple Love at times draws nigh,
The loyal love my heart holds blest;
And Sympathy that does not sigh ,
And Faith in sober garments drest;
And Truth and Honor and the strong,
Brave spirit of the Unresigned ;
Ah ! many miss them in the throng—
“ Blind, good people, blind ! ”
Yea, I have dealt in Charity,
And this of men have come to know—
Whether they live in luxury
Or tread the paths of Want and Woe —
It is a past or present pain
That teaches people to be kind ;
The happy scarcely heed the strain—
“ Blind, good people, blind ! ”

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiik Bulletin would, oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
m ethods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good, thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right, to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where practicable,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence" column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
twe columns in length, or, say, HOOO ivords, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs, Betters, or N ewspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when the
address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But no
MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these conditions
are observed. When MS. is forwarded without stamps
for return it will be understood, that the ' copy is to be
destroyed if not acceptable. Personal applications for
return °f MS. cannot receive attention. The Bulletin
desires, further, thpse sending MS. to distinctly under-
stand that it is not. responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.

Anyone supplying to The Bulletin original humorous

merit and interest and adapted for direct reproduction, or

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1909.
THE BIGGER THINGS.
The session just concluded has been the most fruitful
of all the Federal sessions to date, and has in every way
justified the Fusion which made it possible. It began
amidst storms, which hurtled about our heads for some
time —“the heavens raged furiously.” But the storm
eventuallv blew itself out, when it was seen that the
Government was determined to maintain its position
and get business done. The result is that we have to our
credit, as the result of five months’ work, a list of things
accomplished which ought to be regarded as eminently
satisfactory. For the first time in our Federal history we
have moved amongst the bigger things for which the
Federation was set up.— Joseph Cook.
So the Fused Government goes proudly to the
country on the record of its achievements. It has
been doing the Bigger things. Questions which
had hung fire for years have been settled, and
matters which had lain unfinished since the
beginning of the Commonwealth have been fixed
up, or a specious pretence has been made at fixing
them up. But, after all, the man who ends a
long-standing question or settles a long-enduring
problem isn’t always a person to be proud of.
Long-standing questions are settled quite as
definitely by cowardice and a humble accept-
ance of defeat as by courage and the achievement
of success. Darius 1., great soldier and states-
man as he was, didn t settle the outstanding dif-
ferences between Persia and Greece; it was left
for Godomanus to end IGO years of strife by fleeing
wildly from the battlefield and leaving his king-
dom to be annexed bodily. Similarly, the Austrian
general Mack settled his troubles in a few days by
surrendering to Napoleon- -at Ulm; whereas
Austria’s hero of the time, Charles the Arch-
duke, never wholly settled anything, though he
did a heap of hard and brilliant fighting
and kept his end up till the last. I he
history of the Fused Government has been one
long series of settlements, achieved by taking
the line of least resistance and giving the other
fellow all he asked, and the other fellow must be
very unreasonable indeed if he doesn’t settle when
everything he asks comes liis way. Where courage
and strength were wanted, and mere abjectness
wouldn’t fill the bill, the Fused Ministry just left
the thing unsettled.
* * * *
Probably the matter of which the present
Federal combination is proudest is the settlement
—so far as such a thing can be done until the
necessary referendum is taken —of the financial
relations between the Commonwealth and the
States. Under the Brad don clause three-fourths
of the Customs and Excise revenues go to the
State Treasurers until the end of 1910 ; after that
date they are. according to the the
sole property of the Commonwealth; and the Com-
monwealth, with its defences and its transconti-
nental railways and its other great works to
provide for, requires them all. There was really
no question to be settled here, for the Common-
wealth had merely to wait till the end of 1910 and
then take what legally belonged to it. But the
State Premiers clamored for charity, for tip, for
backsheesh—clamored like sturdy beggars for
what wasn’t theirs, and heaved impossible
threats at the terrified Deakin as to what they
would do if the tip and backsheesh weren t forth-
coming. So the Government settled the question,
which was no question at all, by promising the
State Treasurers a bonus or bribe of 255. per
inhabitant per annum for ever. Thus it moved,
like a caterpillar, among the Bigger Things. OF
course, the promise can’t be kept. When foreign
borrowing has to cease because Uncle Cohen will
lend no more, then Australia must manufacture
more and import less, and its tariff revenue must
drop. When things get down to a normal level,,
there is no reason to believe that Australia s con-
dition will be widely different from that of Ger-
many and the United States, both rich countries
with high tariffs, where the whole produce of
Customs and Excise taxation is only about 15s. or
20s. per inhabitant annually. The Deakin-Cook;
Government knows perfectly well that 255. can t
be paid out of 20s. ; but it holds that sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof. So it settled the
financial matter —though it is pleasing to reflect
that next April’s referendum may unsettle it
again. In other words, it caved in for the sake of
peace, like any other humble object.
•* w * *
Then, again, the Fused Government fixed up
the long-standing Federal capital question,
though next election may unsettle that also. It
took the site which Gregory Wade ordered it to
take, and after it had obeyed his orders, Wade
altered the site, and commanded it to accept his
new arrangement. It did that also. I he lederal
capital territory is to be in two pieces, situated
about 100 miles apart. The alleged Federal port
has no catchment area to supply the town with
fresh water,, and as its coast-line ends at high-
water mark, it won’t even have enough salt water
to float a toy boat. In fact, it isn’t a port, lhe
Federal citv is so short of water-power that autho-
rity is asked for to bring power, at immense cost,
from a State river—the Snowy—loo miles away,
but as the State Government reserves control of
the Snowy, this alleged supply of power is like the
p or t_a mere pretence. There are some fairly
decent streams about Canberra, such as the
Queanbeyan and the Murrumbidgee, but the
State Government reserves them for its own use;
so they are of no value to the Federal city. With
no sea outlet save by the permission of Wade, no
railway land connections save by the sufferance of
Wade and no water-power except by the good-
will of Wade, the new Federal city is merely
Wade’s backyard. But the Fused Government
has, at least, the credit of deciding a vexed ques-
tion of long standing. By unmanly cowardice, by
surrendering the interests of Australia at every
point, by doing exactly what it was told, by being
the flunkey and menial of Wade and the Sydney
morning press, it disarmed opposition, and endeji
a long-drawn-out conflict. It was thus in a
position to say with pride that it had established
much better relations with the State Government
at Sydney than prevailed aforetime. It did the
Bigger Things.-' Unfortunately, it did them m
the Smaller Way—in fact, it did them in the
Smallest Way.
■*.-**■*•
Then the Fused Ministry waded manfully into
the Defence question. The Defence idea was in
the air, and something had to be done. At the
same time the Fuse believed, as usual, in taking
the line of least resistance and being affable to
everybody. Its military scheme deals with a per-
functory training of boys with antiquated rifles of
a pattern which Britain already finds ( of very
little use, and a mere “registration” of its
alleged troops after they emerge from boyhood.
There is hardly even a pretence of making
a real army for the protection of Australia.
And the naval defence consists of a scheme
for building a microscopic squadron with
borrowed money. Unless the Fuse had the cour-
age to lew a,progressive land-tax or to reject the
pTratical d'emands of the State Treasurers for tip
or backsheesh or blackmail, it simply had to bor-
row money, cind &s the Fuse h?icl no couiiige &t.cill
and was scared of its own shadow, it naturally
decided on borrowing. The naval loan is to have
a sinking fund attached, but the fund is so small
that even if nothing happens to the pathetic
little squadron it will probably be dead of old age
before it is paid for. If the squadron runs up
against an active enemy it may be dead 15 years
before it is paid for. Yet the Government, by
much eloquence and high-falutmg, lias almost
persuaded the community that it is doing some-
thing large and tremendous and self-sacrificing in
the Defence line, and the community is pleased to
think that it can be an awful devil of a patriot at
no perceptible expense. Thus the Fuse moved
some more among the Bigger Ihings, stepping
lightly and apologetically as it went lest it should
break something in its progress.
* » * *
It tackled the Northern Territory question also,
and the matter of the two transcontinental rail-
ways. Alfred Deakin fixed up an agreement
wherebv South Australia was to hand over the
Territory at the mere price of the insignificant
local debt; was to transfer its line from Oodna-
datta to Port Augusta, in order that the Common-
wealth might own the railway from sea to sea
with a Federal port at each end ; and was to
permit the construction of a Federal railway
through S.A. territory to Westralia. But the
Deakin-Cooic Ministry hadn’t the courage to
stake its existence on this agreement; in
fact it hadn’t even the courage to put
up a good fight for it. Eastern members
who held that everything must come at whatever
cost to Brisbane and Sydney and Melbourne,
were allowed to mangle the measure almost with-
out protest. In the end it was quite a different
scheme from the one which Deakin drew up m
consultation with the S. A. Premier, and quite
different from the one which was accepted by the
S.A. Legislature. Therefore, it is wholly value-
less unless the S.A. Legislature accepts it, of
which there is very little probability ; and the
transfer of the Territory and the building of the
two railways are really no further advanced than
they were 20 years ago—or 50 years ago for that
matter. Still, while taking the line of submission
and non-resistance, the Fuse has been muddling
among the Bigger Things, even as any small
animal might fuss around among the Pyramids,
and it takes no small pride in the fact.
* • * *
The appointment of a High Commissioner to
-represent Australia in England would have been
an important work if the best man had been
selected for the post. But the Sydney Foreign-
trade and Tory dailies demanded the appointment
of a certain dull old jester from N.S.W., and
Cook lives on the support of these dailies, and
Deakin lives on the support of Cook. George
jßkid is old, slow and heavy. He is not a highly-
educated man. He is not a finn.jier. He is not
a social ornament. He has no great knowledge of
-books, and not too much knowledge of affairs. He
is chiefly a heavy eater of sweets, a sleeper in all
manner of places, a maker of incredibly bad jokes,
and an incurable lecturer to school-children. But
■Cook owed him a debt of gratitude because he
retired and made room for the notable Labor
renegade at the head of the anti-Australian party.
The importing class, of which the S. M. Herald
and Telegraph are the representatives, owed him
a similar debt because he labored for many years
to hinder the progress of Australian industries
in order to make rOom for foreign imports. And
it was worth while to get him out of the way, lest
the old place-hunter should get tired of obscurity
and start to undermine the Deakin-Cook combi-
nation. So democratic and Protectionist young
Australia is to have, as its first representative
abroad, an old, lazy, sleepy, imported Foreign-
trade Tory who hasn’t one idea in common with
the national sentiment of the country for which
he is to speak. In appointing him the Deakin-
Cook Ministry shuffled, as usual, along the easiest
track. Then again, in its struggle after Great
Deeds, it passed a Bill authorising the Common-
wealth to take over the State debts. That ivould,
be a great deed if the Bill also explained how the
thing was to be done—how the problem of equit-
ably lumping Victoria’s £42 per head of liability
and Queensland’s £75 was to be met. But as the
Fused Cabinet shows no sign of having the least
idea how to manage this, its Bill seems to be no
more than a vague announcement of its good in-
tentions.
* * * *
The Deakin-Cook Government has indeed
moved among the Bigger Things, even as a sheep
might go weeping bitterly amid a great range of
mountains. It has broken some of the Things, and
dirtied some of them, and trodden on the rest. Its
cowardice has been appalling. Its subservience
has been a record. Its truckling to the meanest
parochial jealousies has been beyond words. Its
readiness to sacrifice the interests of Australia
every time, to secure its continuance in office or
else to save itself trouble, has been utterly dis-
graceful. It has done a lot in some directions to
establish goodwill between itself and certain State
Premiers —by the simple process of pandering to
their worst political vices. It has sold Australia’s
future in return for a wrinkled smile from Wade
and a pat on the head from KiDSXON. Affability
has been its strong point; it is so affable that it is
anybody’s dog and everybody’s office-boy. There
is no tight in it; it would even take off its hat to
a cow and apologise for walking past the animal.
Under its policy of perpetually “ consulting Mr.
Wade,” the Federal authority has become a mere
shadow, and the harsh and incapable political
lawyer at Sydney has grown to be the real ruler
of Australia. Any power which doesn’t lie in his
hands seems to belong to William Kidston —
John Murray, of Melbourne, being, except at
rare intervals, too tired and slouchy to count for
much. It will take years to rescue the Federal
authority from the contempt into which Deakin
arid Cook have dragged it j and, unfortunately,
the strong man who is to do the rescue work
doesn’t seem to be in sight at present.
THE TERRITORY; WHAT NEXT?
Nothing has been heard so far as to the next steps
to be taken with regard to the Northern Territory
and thepairof transcontinental railways. Probably
enough, there will be no next steps at present,
and the Senate’s insane rejection of the Dkakin-
Price agreement will end the matter, at least for
the lifetime of the present Ministry and possibly
for the term of many future Ministries. It has,
unfortunately, come to be understood that if there
is anything going which can be divided among
three States it must go to N.S.W., Victoria and
Queensland. If there is anything going that can
only be shared by two States it must go toN.S.W.
and Victoria, or else to N.S.W. and Queensland.
If there is anything going that can only belong to
one State, N.S.W. must have it, and it
must be placed as near Sydney as possible.
Thus N.S.W. demanded the Federal capital (to
be placed as near Sydney as possible), the Federal
arms factory (also to be as near Sydney as pos-
sible), the Federal naval station (to be at Sydney,
despite the utter unfitness of a crowded commer-
cial port for naval purposes), the Federal ship-
building yards (also to be at Sydney), and the
Federal transcontinental railway (which, it is
urged, should take a long, costly circuit through
the absurdly dry country of south-west Queens-
land, in order that it may end at Sydney, though
an attempt is made to capture Victorian votes by
the publication of a map which shows an exten-
sion, via Broken Hill, to the Victorian border).
On the same principle it has been earnestly urged
that the transcontinental line from Perth should be
carried through a specially dry region to Cobar, in
order that it may also go direct to Sydney; and
on similar lines certain blatant fools in the N.S.W.
Assembly raised Cain over the proposal to employ
one or two men at Adelaide in the production of
Federal postage stamps, and talked secession un-
less all stamps were printed at Sydney. So it was
quite in the natural order of things that the
parochialists of the eastern States should decide
that the Northern Territory may go to the Jap or
the Chinaman or the Devil unless the railway,
which is its only possible means of defence, comes
round, at an absurd extra cost, through their own
bit of country. Yet that deviated railway wouldn’t
bring either Sydney or Melbourne any closer to
Port Darwin. 'The demand for it merely repre-
sents the craving to have everything dragged into
“ our ” State.
■* * * *
The eastern deviation party puts its case
cunningly enough. It simply demands that the
direction of the transcontinental line shall be left
open, and that the Australian Parliament shall
be entrusted with the job of selecting the best
route. And it asks with joyous frankness whether
the Australian Parliament can’t be trusted to
select the best route. To wnieh South Australia
naturally replies, with emphasis, ‘‘No.” When
the Federal capital question was at issue, N.S.W.
politicians simply demanded possession of the
capital —-not on the plea that they had a better
site to offer than any other State possessed, but on
the ground that, they wanted the capital and were
darned well going to have it. They flatly refused to
trust the Australian Parliament with the selection
of the best site, and S.A. has no more faith in the
Federal Parliament than they had. They de-
manded possession of the naval headquarters and
the Federal shipbuilding yards and the arms
factory on the same comprehensive principle.
When it was shown that stamps were printed
more cheaply at Adelaide than anywhere else, the
cry went up that these things didn’t go by cheap-
ness or convenience or suitability or anything like
that; the Ma State had a right to even the
stamp-printing job because it was the Ma State,
and things would smash if it didn’t get the stamp-
printing job. In the face of these experiences,
the South Australians would be an exceedingly
foolish community if they took anything for
granted outside the letter of their bond. Prob-
ably enough, even the bond would prove delusive,
and after South Australia had surrendered the
Territory on the assurance that the straight line
would be built, an amending Act would shift the
line to the eastward after all. Solemn pledges don’t
count for much with a certain class of parochial
politician. No agreement could have been more
binding on the national honor than that by which
the Reid Government invited the other States to
join in the Federal movement some 15 years ago.
Yet it was broken as shamelessly as any spy or
thief or informer might break his pledged word,
and the man at whose instance it was broken
represents N.S.W. in Parliament to this day, and
doesn’t seem to have the faintest idea that he
ought to be an object of public scorn and contempt.
» * * *
The action of the Federal Parliament in reject-
ing some of the main features of the DeaklN-
Price agreement not only puts an end to the
arrangement for the transfer of the Northern Ter-
ritory to the Commonwealth and the building of
the line to Port Darwin, but also to the building
of the railway to connect the Bast with Kal-
goorlie and Perth. All these matters have gone
overboard unless S.A. chooses to make some
new arrangement. And the proposed line from
Port Darwin through the eastern States has, of
course, gone overboard with the rest. The
question now arises : What should S.A. do in the
matter? If it refuses to enter into any new
negotiations, and resumes, in a slow fashion, the
building of the line to Port Darwin out of its own
scanty resources, it is plain that it will be much
longer than need otherwise be before the defence-
less North gets the railway connection which is
essential to its protection.. On the other hand, if
S.A. surrenders its point, and hands over the
Territory, and allows the eastern railway devia-
tion to be built, it will end all reasonable
chance of the transcontinental railway being
connected with the northern part of Westralia,
which is just as empty and vulnerable,
aiid in need of means of communication
as the Territory itself. Also it will give
a fresh impetus to the policy of con-
gesting all Australia’s population into the
eastern corner of the continent, and leaving the
rest of the land without people to defend it.
Unless some State takes up arms against the insane
icea of dragging everything to Sydney and Mel-
bourne, Australia will consist of one bloated ex-
crescence in the south-east and an illimitable
wilderness, and S.A. is the only State which is in
a position to protest effectively. The theory of
Sydney and Melbourne, that the north-western
half or three-fourths of the continent doesn’t
matter a straw, is the curse and disaster of
this nation. Probably the best thing that S.A.
can do is to promptly resume the building of its
great railway northward, however slow the
work may be, and trust to Providence. As soon
as it can struggle with its line across the southern
border of the Territory and into the mineral
country of the Macdonnell Ranges, the work will
almost certainly become a paying proposition, and
further extensions will become easier. As for the
line to Kalgoorlie and Perth, that apparently will
also have to be done by the two States interested.
The present Fused Government is a flabby affair,
and great national undertakings are evidently
beyond it. Some day when it is dead and, like
jEHOrAKiM of Judah, has been buried with the
burial of an ass, a Ministry may arise which lias
the courage to think in continents ; but that is a
matter for the future.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Lost Cause.
The Labor party in the N.S.W. Legislature is
getting the reward it might reasonably have ex-
pected in the shape of the Wade Government’s
anti-strike legislation. It is the peculiarity of
the mismanaged N.S.W. State Labor crowd that
it' only fights people like Wade and Carruthers
when there isn’t a ghost of a chance of success.
As a purely Labor organisation, only putting up a
real battle on purely Labor questions, it knows
perfectly well that it has no liopp. It can tell
that by counting its pledged supporters. As a
National Australian party and a party of honest
finance, with a Labor programme attached, it
could rake in so many more supporters that it
might have achieved the political extinction of
Carruthers and Wade long ago. If the Labor
push had gone in solidly and honestly for an
anti-borrowing policy, and had put up a whole-
souled fight against bogus surpluses and sham
balance-sheets, it could almost certainly have got
enough support outside its own ranks three years
back to put it in power, and, if it lived up to its
principles, to keep it. there ; but apparently it
preferred big loans and prospective bankruptcy
to the attainment of office. If it could have got
away from the purely parish-minded view of things
—if it could have learned that there is such a
place as Australia, or even that there is such a
place as N.S.W. apart from Sydney—it could have
shoved the Carruthers-Wade gang out of its job
over and over again; but it always refused the
chance. When Carruthers did his insolent act
of rebellion against the Australian Government
over the wire-netting steal, office was simply
waiting for McGowen and Holman ; but they
thought it better to be impertinent and nasty
to the Australian Cabinet than to seize the
chance of putting the Tory party out of
power and getting an opportunity to carry
out the Labor programme, so they did
nothing of any importance. In all Wade’s
long career of impertinence and aggression
over the Federal capital question and the
tariff revenue question and other matters in
all the quarrels and squabbles and petty mean-
nesses of his dealings with the Australian Govern-
ment—the State Labor party, instead of taking
up the cause of Australia, strove to be even
smaller-minded and more parochial and more anti-
Australian than Wade himself. It kept the
Carruthers-Wade gang in power over these
matters, and when, the other day, it put up a
hopeless fight over the coal-strike question, on
which it couldn’t command a single vote save that
of its own direct following, it got the repayment it


might have expected in the shape of Wade s boot
and Wood’e contempt. Wade’s security lies in
the fact that he knows the smallness, the narrow-
ness, and theparish-mindednessof McGowen and
Holman, and is perfectly well aware that they will
never attack him except under hopeless circum-
stances. If they become too aggressive and too
dangerous, he can always disarm them by doing
something paltry and anti-Australian and anti-
Federal, and then they become so filled with
admiration for him that the.y lay down their arms.
The cause of the Newcastle miners wasn’t lost
last week. It was lost some years ago, when
the leaders of the State Labor party were
so filled with petty anti-Australian and anti-
Federal sentiment that they couldn’t bring them-
selves to make a whole-souled attack on Joseph
Carruthers over his amazing wire-netting insur-
rection. Rather than be good patriotic Aus-
tralians in 1907 they abandoned their chance of
being in power to-day, and consequently it
is Gregory Wade instead of James McGowen
who is dealing with the coal problem, and
the results are only what might be expected. The
chances of the miners were lost, too, over the
Federal capital question, and the borrowing
question, and the 255. subsidy agreement. Proba-
bly the miners themselves didn’t pay much atten-
tion to these matters ; yet it was inattention to
them that buried their hopes and their oppor-
tunities. The successful politician needs to look 10
or 20 or 50 years ahead ; the regrettable fact is that
McGowen and Holman don’t seem able to look
more than a month or a week ahead. For years,
in their narrowness and parochialism and anti-
Federalism, they have been strengthening the
hands of the N.S.W. Tory party, and now when
they bump against it they are surprised at the
Tory party’s strength, and can only rave im-
potently, while the Tory Ministers whom they
created grin in derision and move that “ the
question be now put.”

A True Tale from South Clifton.
One of the South Clifton (N.S.W.) coal-miners
talked to The Bulletin
“ Give us eight hours bank to bank, and I believe the
Southern men would go back to work to-morrow. Down
here in Sydney most people think we’ve got the eight
hours already. * All miners have it, they say. When you
tell them that more than a third of the hands are in the
mines for 10 hours a day they won’t believe it. Then
they say ‘ Oh, I know what you want. You want to be
paid for the time you’re walking back and forth.’ And
that’s wrong too.
“ It’s this way. We are back shift and front shift.
One goes in at seven and comes off at three ; the other
goes in at nine and comes off at five. That’s the
miners. But there are wheelers, clippers and the other
boys—little bits of fellows some of them, not much taller
than that paste-pot. They go in at seven and they don’t
come out till five. Same with the shiftmen—they’re day
men who are laying roads and putting in timber and
doing odd jobs. They work 10 hours, too.
“It’s the boys that we want eight hours for most.
Ten hours is too long in a mine. They say we’re never
satisfied. -Well, what we’re fighting for first and fore-
most doesn’t in one way affect more than a third of us.
But it affects our boys. A nipper goes in with his father
at seven o’clock. The father comes out at three—the boy
has to stay two hours longer. That isn’t right; the
father wants to see the boy come out of the mine when
he comes out himself. You know what a coal mine is.
Maybe you know what it is to have a lad, too. Let us all
go in together and come out together, and I believe the
owners will get just as much work done as they do now.
“ The only difference it will make to us miners is that
it will be safer for us. It stands to reason when I go on
at seven and work alone for two hours, and then my mate
comes and he works alone for two hours after I knock off,
that it can’t be as safe as if we went in together and
knocked off together.
“ Of course we’ve got our own little special trouble at
South Clifton. You know about that. We’ve been
out now nigh on three months. The owners asked us if
we would let a couple of men or so in on off days, when
there wasn’t work for the mine, just to clean up bits of
pillars and so on. See, perhaps there’s only a few yards
of a pillar left, and if it isn’t taken out and filled away
the roof’ll come in, and the coal is lost. The lodge said
‘ Certainly—it was reasonable.’ But they broke faith
with us. Instead of cleaning up old pillars, they started
opening up new ones, and things like that. Near on 40
men went in. When we saw that, we didn’t like it, and
had a meeting. We decided that any man who went in
on off-days should be fined lOs.
“ How did it affect us? This way. On those off-days
there’s no hauling. We just break the coal and fill the
skips, and they’ve got to be taken to bank before we can
get a start next day. It wouldn’t matter with only two
or three men in ; but with 40 men in they filled so
many skips that when we did go in we couldn’t get
skips for our coal, so we couldn’t earn much more than
half what we could if the empty skips were there for us.
It meant making the wheelers handle two days’ coal in
one day, see. So, as it was a breach of faith, too, we put
on the 10s. fine. After that 11 men went in, and the
lodge fined them. Seven paid, two left the district, and
two stayed and defied the rest. If they’d thought the
lodge was wrong in fining them, they ought to have
appealed. That’s the rule. Why, one of them, William-
son, was one of the lodge officers that made that rule and
signed it. When he saw how things were the
manager told the two they couldn’t have lamps.
But they came down to Sydney, and Mr. Wadk
got in his fine work—they' saw the owners before lunch
and Mr. Wade after lunch, and the next we knew was
that these two men turned up at the lamp cabin. So the
men sat down on the grass and had a talk about it. These
men hadn’t only defied the lodge, and wouldn’t do what
they had agreed to do, but since then they nad refused
to pay their dues. You know what that means. I don’t
want to say it. So the shift didn’t go in, and we haven’t
been in since. They’re still there ; and they say they’re
going in. If they do—well, I don’t think we will.
“ That’s our own little trouble. So if the eight hours
is fixed up all right, vve’ll be up against these two men,
and if we swallow them we’ll have to swallow all our
union principles too. And even Mr. Wade can’t make us
do that.”

Tlie Dry Bread Country.
Will Grooks, British M.P. for Woolwich, who
recently passed through Melbourne on his way
back to England, is a fairly interesting talker till
he gets on the fiscal question. Then his dreary
old superstition gets him down and bites him.
This was the message that W. Crooks left behind
him in Melbourne :
I do not believe that a man or woman would for a
single instant dream bf Protection or Preference that
would make the BREAD OF THE POOR dearer. They
would scorn the idea.
It is a grievous thing, this constant moaning of
the British Freetrader about the bread of the
poor. He never talks of the butter of the poor,
or the meat or eggs or bacon or cheese or fish or
tea or coffee or sugar of the poor—only of the
bread. He doesn’t even talk of the clothes or
home or furniture of the poor. When there is a
fiscal battle on hand the British Freetrader carries
round a beggared banner on which he has depicted
a big loaf and a small one, and he cries out about
bread—dry, dry bread. He is a resigned person.
In almost the richest country on earth he accepts
poverty and dry bread as the necessary concomi-
tants of his fiscal creed so far as the multitude is
concerned. Seeing that he leaves the clothes and
home and furniture out of his tale, the inference
is that he depicts the happy domicile of the
British worker as an unfurnished room in which
naked Freetraders sit on the floor around a big, un-
buttered loaf, without even a herring to adorn the
landscape. In Protectionist Australia dry bread
doesn’t loom up and obliterate the horizon as it
does in England. This, for instance, is Cogiilan’s
latest estimate of the annual food bill of all Aus-
tralia :
Meat .. £19,920,000
Milk, butter, cheese, etc. .. 12,102,000
Vegetables and fruit .. .. 8,752,000
BREAD 7,357,000
Other foods .. .. .. 7,710,000
Sugar 3,796,000
Miscellaneous farm produce ... 2,100,000
Tea, coffee, etc 2,004,000
Soft drinks 1,758,000
£65,499,000
In a country where the pale, innutritious, tasteless
crust only stands for one-ninth of the food supply
this British bread-obsession is difficult to under-
stand. It represents a point of view which Pro-
tectionist Australia can hardly realise. It is
only in a country where the masses live
in dire poverty that cheapness—the saving
of half a farthing or so on a single damp,
indigestible article of diet—-is of such stupendous
importance that it looms up and obscures every
other consideration. Yet bread has gone up hor-
ribly inßritain. First thatcountry wentin for Free-
trade in order to get cheap bread. Then Free trade
so ruined local agriculture that a land which once
grew enough food for 24,000,000 people now only
supplies about 4,000,000. Then Yankee wheat
rings, finding that they had Britain at their
mercy, skied the price till the cheap loaf became a
thing of the past. And wages are low in Freetrade
Britain; to take only one example, Whitaker’s
Almanac for 1908 (page 666) sets down the average
pay of the British railway employee at £66
2s. lid. per week, while in Protectionist N.S.W.
(Official Year Book of N.S.W. for 1907-8, page
296) they are estimated at £ll2 11s. With it all
the Briton gets his loaf no cheaper than the
N.S.W. person, though, being a slow-moving per-
son who takes a long while to realise things, he
still thinks that he does. And he is so unable to
pay for his loaf that last year the London County
Council had to supply 4,546,771 meals to
school children because they were too famished
to be able to attend to their lessons without
eleemosynary sustenance, and this year things are
so much worse that it is estimated the free meals
to the empty-stomached school-kid will number
7,702,506. With all this the British citizen is the
most heavily-taxed person on earth. His loaf isn’t
taxed, but his home is—to an incredible degree.
He has the most costly defence system on earth—
partly because, Freetrade having almost ruined
his agriculture and thrown his agricultural popu-
lation out of work, he has to maintain almost im-
possible sea armaments to prevent his imported
food supplies being cut off. But, amid all his
struggles, all his misery, all his starvation and
growing pauperism, he remains the same self-
satisfied British person as of old, and sends
abroad people like Crooks to lecture on the
advantages of dry bread and heaps of imports.
And he can’t realise that the awful mess he has
made of his own affairs should disqualify him from
giving advice to people who have managed their
business a lot better.
Strikes, Vends., etc.
The present N.S.W. Ministry has done a good
many astonishing things, but it broke its own dis-
graceful record last week when it bludgeoned its
Anti-Strike Bill through Parliament without
letting members see the Bill at all. No member
was allowed a copy of it for careful examination,
and even Wade’s blind majority hardly knew
what kind of measure it was passing. The
law, as it transpired in due time, declares
that coal, gas. water and ordinary articles
of food are “necessary commodities,” and it sets
forth that wherever two or more persons are
gathered together (as if one person could gather
together!) to instigate, aid, abet, manage or
direct a strike or lock-out dealing with any neces-
sary commodity the bobby shall be in the midst
of them, and they shall be liable to 12 months in
gaol, Also the police may burst into pre-
mises where they imagine such meetings
are .being held, and may seize people and
documents. Therefore it seems that the force
may rush the office of the Worker, or the
Star or The Bulletin under a suspicion that the
editor and the financial editor and the sub-editor
have gathered together in a room to discuss the
details of a pro-strike leading article which is to
be written by one of them. But it seems to be
quite certain that Wade’s frantic law is only in-
tended to touch one class of strikers. When the
aggregate miner or some such person announces
that he will no longer follow his calling as a coal-
digger unless he gets concessions equivalent,
perhaps, in the aggregate to Id. a ton in cash, that
is a strike, and it is always called one. When the
aggregate coal-dealer or some such person declares
that he will no longer follow his calling as a coal-
supplier unless he gets concessions equivalent, per-
haps, to 2s. a ton, that is also a strike; but somehow
it is never called one. And the new law evidently
doesn’t intend to call it one. True, there has
been inserted, for appearance sake, a clause which
puts the employers who engineer a lockout on the
same level as the men who engineer a strike ; but
then there is never any such thing as a lockout.
When the combined employers desire, for any
reason, to bring on a complete and abrupt stop-
page of work, they just reduce wages or introduce
new and vexatious fines and penalties and regula-
tions until the men are driven to take the initia-
tive. Furthermore, there are clauses in the Act
which make vends and such-like combinations in
restraint of trade illegal, but there is a curious
difference about these clauses. For instance,
where the striker is liable to 12 months in gaol,
the illegal combination man is only liable to be
fined £5OO, and £5OO isn’t much to a vend. Again,
while the police may burst into any building
where they suspect “ two or more persons ” to be
talking strike, and may seize whatever documents
are necessary to a conviction, there is no such pro-
vision in the case of a vend or other combination
in restraint of trade. Therefore it will be very
difficult to convict it unless in a wild and deranged
moment it hands over its own papers, And these
spells of madness are not frequent with vends.

The Loan Fleet.
The Fused Federal Government, in its eternal
search for the easy down-grade road which leads
to perdition, has decided to build the first instal-
ment of Australia’s fleet with borrowed money.
And, doubtless, it intends that the second and
third and all future instalments shall be built in
like manner. The first haval loan is to be for
£3,500,000, and it is proposed to establish a sink-
ing fund of £175,000 a year (not to begin till July,
1912) which, it is expected, will wipe out the loan
in about 1(5 years. By this arrangement the
Deakin-Cook Government saves itself the worry,
heat, annoyance, perspiration and responsibility
of raising the wind per medium of a progressive
land-tax. The progressive land-tax would
break up big estates, provide land for the
people, and make room for a great in-
flux of new taxpayers and new defenders;
and, incidentally, it would probably furnisii
enough money to pay for the first consignment of
ships’ as soon as they are ready; but it would
annoy big landlords and cantankerous State
Premiers, and Deakin and Cook these days would
apparently rather see the country in perdition
tfian annoy big landlords and cantankerous State
Premiers. Besides it would be hard work, and
would make Deakin hot and Cook sour and tired.
By.postponing the beginning of the sinking fund
for three years Deakin and Cook avoid immediate
worry; probably they will be out of office in three
years. Also the question of finding the interest
on the naval loan won’t come along for a while,
and the question of maintaining the squadron is
some distance ahead; and the Fusion will very
likely be out of office before these troubles arise
also. As already mentioned, the ships are to be
paid for by the time they are 16 years old —that
is to say, by 1928. Even if a warship doesn’t
strike a rock, or a fatal storm, or another ship, or
an enemy’s fleet, it is a very very old craft after 16
Among the 30 battleships on which Ger-
many relies the oldest is only aged 11 years, and a
Gerptan ironclad aged 12 is classed among “ships of
questionable fighting value.” TheFatherland’sold-
est armored cruiser is aged nine years ; its oldest
protected cruiser is aged 13. Apparently the .Austra-
lian warships will be dead before they are paid for,
even if nothing happens to them and they never
fire a shot. It is a lazy, shiftless, helpless business
—the work of lazy, incompetent political wasters.
A live Government would have started by setting
aside at least £1,000,000 a year now towards the
cost of the first squadron and towards the building
of subsequent vessels as they are wanted. If Aus-
tralia can’t pay anything per annum to-day towards
the building of its ships, how does it expect to
manage in (say) 1913, when the annual bill for
maintenance, interest and sinking fund will be
about £BOO,OOO ? On the other hand, if it can pay
£BOO,OOO in 1913, and a great deal more afterwards
when the fleet grows larger, there is no reason,
save the desire of Deakin and Cook to postpone
all possible trouble, why it shouldn’t start paying
at once, and thus make things easier for the future.
The only reason for having a fleet is that war
must come some day. War is desperately expen-
sive ; it requires big loans at short notice,
and Bull won’t be lending money abroad
then, for he will want all he has. So Australia,
with its railways and ships and almost everything
else unpaid for, with its interest probably in
arrear through inability to get its wool and
other produce to Europe and turn them into cash,
with its credit temporarily burst, and with not a
penny of a fund with which to pay even for extra
stores and repairs, will probably be hardly able
even to get its borrowed-money fleet to sea. It is
a dismal outlook for Australia, but it is probably
right enough for Deakin and Cook. They will
eo to the country and say: “Are we not the
thoughtful, sagacious people who managed to get
through without laying new tax burdens upon
you?” and a voice will answer “Yes.” Then
they will say : “ Are we not also the enterprising,
vigorous people who started to create a fleet?’’
and again a voice will answer “Yes.” And the
vision of Posterity struggling with the bill will
pass quite unnoticed. What does Posterity
matter ?

The ink on the Bill fixing the Federal capital at
Yass’oerra was scarcely dry before another move
was made in the game for further congesting
Sydney and the railway lines that run into it.
It is proposed to connect Boinaderry, the present
terminus of the N.S.W. South Coast line, with
Jervis Bay, and the State’s Public Works Com-
mittee is collecting reasons for doing it. Among
the witnesses was F. Morton, M.L.A., who said
straight out why he wanted a railway to the
alleged Federal port: —
His particular' reason for believing that the work should
be a railway and not a tramway was because of the prob-
ability of the Commonwealth Government constructing a
line from the Federal capital at Canberra to Jervis Bay ;
and by the State Government constructing a railway from
Bomaderry to Jervis Bay, the two systems would be con-
nected, and trade from the district around the Federal
capital would be brought to Sydney.
Of course, “the trade from around the Federal
capital will be brought to Sydney.” Where else
can it go? The Federal Territory is to end at
high-water mark at Jervis Bay, so the Common-
wealth can’t make the place a port for oversea
shipping and send its sea traffic that way. The
State Government, which owns the alleged
Federal harbor, doesn’t purpose to make it a port
—its haste to push along the South Coast line
proves that. Therefore the trade from around the
Federal capital must be brought to Sydney,
which, of course, was one of the reasons why
Sydney fixed the capital at Yassberra.

“ San Rbmo ” writes :
Joseph Cook was asked in the House last week if Aus-
tralia’s cruiser battleship was to be of the Lion type, and,
as usual, he didn’t know. What be doesn’t know
would fill a crater. I answer the question in the
negative. Australia’s cruiser battleship will be of the
Invincible type. The Lion represents the very latest
species of giant armored cruiser or cruiser battleship—
-20,000 tons, with a speed of 27 knots, engines to develop
70,000 h.p. The Invincibles had a guaranteed speed of 25
knots, but have logged as high as 27 knots, while, with
the Admiralty bonus on speed in excess of the registered
contract, it is possible that the Lion ships will register 28
or 29 knots. The Invincible class of cruiser carries a
primary battery of eight 12in. guns.
The armament of the Lion type is kept secret so far,
but it seems likely that an extra two or four big guns
will be added to the eight of the Invincible. The German
giant cruisers carry a battery equal to Britain’s Dread-
nought battleships. The British Admiralty is still con-
servative in the matter of gun power
Since the Dreadnought era German warships have main-
tained a preponderance in gun-metal over contemporary
British vessels, nor can the British vessels show any com-
pensating advantage in armor plating to make good this
weakness. When the British cruiser battleship bumps a
German cruiser that carries a heavier battery, Bull
will realise that he’s right up against it. And when Aus-
tralia’s eight-gun cruiser collides with a Jap having 10 or
12 guns, the captain of that ill-fated vessel will not even
have time to curse the kind of Defence Minister who
couldn’t answer a simple question.
When a highly-probable enemy like Japan has 10-gun
ships, it’s a poor policy to attempt the defence of Aus-
tralia with an eight-gun type, and if the Fused Govern-
ment sinks £4,000,000 of Australian money upon ships
which do not represent the very latest improvements in
naval construction, then it deserves to be kicked into the
Pacific.

WADE’sUpperHouseinN.S.W. joyously knocked
the bottom out of his Bill providing for the re-
sumption of large estates for closer settlement; it
was a very poor Bill at the beginning, and it was
a hopeless beggar of a Bill at the end. Murray,
in Victoria, had even worse luck. The Assembly
passed his Progressive Land Tax Bill; but the
House of Landlords humorously knocked out
every item of it except the clauses providing for
a valuation of land. They cheerfully proposed that
a great deal of money should be spent on valuing
land, not in order to do anything with the valua-
tion, but simply that the valuers might enjoy
the open air and have a look at the scenery.
The futile Deakin refused to hear of a Federal
progressive land-tax, but he promised to call on
the States to unlock their big estates “as they
had never been called upon before.” So far
nobody has heard Alfred calling louder than a
chicken’s sneeze, and he must be a desperately
vain man if he fancies that any call he can make,
even if he calls like a howler monkey, will avail
when the demand of a large majority of the
people’s Chamber only arouses the Landlords to
a wild laugh of derision. If Alfred ever begins
to call the only people who need conversion—
the members of the Vic. Upper House—won’t go
to hear his silvery oration, nor will they read it
in the paper next day, and if anybody tells them
that the great Talker has been on the flute they
will vawn heavily and say, “ Dear me, how foolish
of him ! ”
»
Three weeks or so after the coal-miners’ strike
started. Treasurer Waddell gave the N.S.W.
Assembly a little inconspicuous information con-
cerning the vastly cheekier strike of coal-mine
owners. Some of these owners had contracts with
the Railway Department ; yet no sooner did
the strike start than the contracts were sus-
pended, and, instead of getting the old 9s. sd.
or 9s. lOd. per ton, the cos. demanded
and got 40s. per ton from the Railways.
This coal hadn’t cost the cos. a penny more to get
than usual; in fact, it was all broken before the
strike. Yet as soon as the trouble happened, the
cos. went on strike, not for an extra tuppence a
ton, but for an extra 31s. per ton. In other
words, supposing they made 2s. per ton profit out
of the coal as a general thing, they now demanded
a profit of 335. per ton. They struck, in short,
not for a 5 per cent, rise, but for an 1100 per cent,
ri se—and, they (jot it. In the 10 days between
November 10 and 22 no less than 9900 tons were
bought at 405., and some of it wasn’t screened coal
either. No wonder the cos. weren’t in any hurry
to finish the trouble. It isn’t every day they can
clean out their rubbish dumps at a rise of 1100 per
cent, on their ordinary profits.
♦
Some of the Victorian coal-owners look as though
they wouldn’t mind having a strike on their
hands too. The Gippsland mines at present can’t
turn out much than 2000 tons a week, of
which the railways take 1500; and, as the con-
tracts are in arrear, the department is just now
collecting the whole output—at the contract price
of 12s. a ton. Private Enterprise was very glad to
get those contracts when they were made, but
now that coal is about 40s. a ton in Melbourne i I
isn’t so anxious. In fact, it is dour and dis
gruntled. As Tait insists on having all the coal
he can claim, the only way for Private Enterprise
to escape the contract is to engineer a strike, and
then try to work its mines with non-union
labor, as it did a few years back. It would
not get a great deal of coal out; but it
has a notion, apparently, that 500 tons at
40s. would pay better than 2000 tons at 12s.
Anyway, it is trailing its coat in the dirt at every
opportunity, and asking the miners to tread on
the tail of it—as, for instance, when the J um-
bunna Co. the other day refused to allow a ballot
for a check weighman to be held on the lease, and
declared that it would close down the mine before
it would recognise the Victorian Coal Miners’
Association in any way.
♦
The land-grabber is so used to grabbing the un-
earned increment that even when the Law says
he shall not be entitled to it the authorities don’t
seem able to bring themselves to believe that the
law can really mean what it says. Thus Mines
Minister Mcßride, of Victoria, lately bought
320 acres for the expected township at the Powlett
coalfield at £l5 per acre, notwithstanding that the
Powlett land, like much other public land, was
originally sold with a condition that the State
could resume it for railway, irrigation or other
purposes at 15s. per acre. And all that Mcßride
can say in defence is that it is splendidly situated
land, and he’ll probably be able to quite easily
pass the extra price on to somebody else.
Steel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A shipment of 15,000 tons of steel rails has been dis-
patched from Sydney, Nova Scotia. It is to be carried
around Cape Horn to Prince Rupert and used in connec-
tion with the railway extension to that port,— Standard
of Empire (London), 8/9/'O9.
An interesting shipment recently passed through
Winnipeg. It consisted of a train of 28 cars loaded with
steel for the Lulu Island swing span, which is under con-
struction at New Westminster, British Columbia. The
whole shipment consisted of huge steel girders, which, as
far as is known, are the largest ever produced, being
232 ft. in length and weighing 78 tons each. They are the
product of the Canada Foundry Company, of Toronto,
and are a splendid example of the enormous development
of Canadian industries during recent years.— Same paper,

The Wade Government decided last week to
take to itself yet another member, and even the
S. M. Herald (21/12/’O9) set up a faint moan of
protest at the idea. N.S.W.’s million and a half
inhabitants have already to find or borrow the
cash for the punctual payment year by year of a
Ministryextensiveenough toruntheUnited States.
Since the beginning of Federation, the post, tele-
graph and telephone systems have been under the
control of the Australian Government; so have the
Customs; so has Defence. The Local Govern-
ment Act removed a large share of responsibility
from the central administration and handed it
over to the shires. The position of the N.S.W.
State Parliament at this time of day is really
no more than that of a glorified Shire Council.
The N.S.W. public indicated its appreciation of
the increasing unimportance of its State Legisla-
ture by voting whole-heartedly, when it got the
chance, for as much reduction of State member-
ship as it was allowed to. It is not seriously dis-
puted in any quarter that, if the electors were
accorded the chance, they would cut the
Macquarie-street talking-shop down even further.
Under these circumstances the idea of raising the
number of Ministers to 10 —it used to be nine in
Robertson’s day when Defence, Post Office,
Customs and Excise were all State concerns—
shines out, like a burning lunatic asylum. No
doubt Wade is overworked, but he needn’t be
overworked; it is only because of the energy he
wastes in fighting innumerable hopeless law
cases and getting the State thrown out with
derision and Costs, and because of his immense
labors in the way of being nasty to the Common-
wealth and meddling with Commonwealth affairs
that don’t concern him, that he is the tired man
he happens to be. It is notable that the new man
is to be Solicitor-General; there is to be a
Solicitor-General as well as an Attorney-General.
This; great rush of law to the Cabinet suggests
that Wade means to fight hopeless law cases with
more fury than ever. And what does N.S.W.
get out of Wade’s frenzy for law ?
o
One of the heaviest missiles which struck Gregory
Wade, of Sydney, last week was a letter by Alex.
Kethel and Co., coal merchants. Kethel and
Co. are outside the coal vend, and naturally
they; didn’t feel good towards it and
rather sympathised with the miners during the
present disturbance. Premier Wade, who seems
to hold a brief for the vend—which is plainly an
association formed in restraint of trade—spoke
violently in the Assembly about Kethel’s people
as individuals who had a fore-knowledge of
the strike, and had loaded themselves up
with coal which they sold at a great
profit, being thereby enabled to clear off
a burdensome overdraft. Kethel’s reply was
that they had laid in no extra supply of
coal, as alleged (they gave exact details of
their stocks just before the strike and on the
first of every previous month for half a year
previously), that the alleged large overdraft
was an invention, and that the alleged repayment
of it jyas false. It short, they broadly hinted that
WADfe had used the security of his Parliamentary
position to meanly slander a firm which was
outside the vend and which professed a certain
sympathy for the coal-miners. It isn’t a nice
thing for any Premier to have said about him. Is
Wade going to do anything?
♦
Two recent reports have uplifted once more that
emtankerous nightmare, “Divided Control,” to
the scoff of a weary world. In report No. 1 the
Sydney Harbor Commissioners pointed out that
they are responsible for the management of the
port, but that when they try to go ahead with the
business they find themselves in the fairway of
some other authority, and are asked wherein Sheol
they are steering. As an instance, they quoted a
case in which an oversea vessel drove its bowsprit
violently through one of the principal traffic
regulations. The Commissioners reached for
the skipper, but on appeal the Supreme
Court told that mariner he could depart in
peace, because his ship was in charge of
a compulsory pilot when the event happened.
As the Commissioners had no power to talk to the
pilot—-he belonged to some other portion of the
Divided Jim-Jam—they just had to let it go at
that. In report No. 2, the Sydney Water and
Sewerage Board remarked that it was doing its
level best to keep the city’s water catchment area
free from pollution, but it couldn’t make much
progress while the Government Tourist Bureau
was advertising places on the area as magnificent
holiday resorts, so that the open-air fanatic and
kindred nuisances might be encouraged to go
there, and deposit the potted-ham tin and other
trifles. Also the report mentioned that there are
four cemeteries on the area, and the Board’s
doubts as to the efficacy of four cemeteries as a
water-purifier appear to be grave. The Board
can’t do anything to the four cemeteries by reason
of the Divided Fantod above-mentioned ; but it is
asking “ Whaffor?” in a very loud tone of voice.
As the folk in the graveyard are dead and the
Government is deaf, there is no answer to the
Board’s query.
♦
“Sydneyite”: The failure to keep ten bar har-
bors clear in spite of dredging and costly break-
waters shows that the N.S.W. Harbors and
Rivers Department should adopt some other
policy. The only way out of the difficulty is to
concentrate all effort on to two or thfee ports cap-
able of receiving vessels of the largest size, and feed
them with railways; while such rivers as the
Tweed, Richmond, Manning, Hunter and others
should be left to Nature. Brisbane is undoubtedly
the proper port for the Tweed and Richmond
River districts, if only it were connected by rail-
way. Coff’s Harbor could be made to do duty
for another district, including the Bellinger, Clar-
ence and Macleay ; and Port Stephens would save
the lives of many gallant ships and men if it were
to replace the death traps of Port Hunter and the
Manning. Of course, such a scheme would meet
with a storm of violent disapproval from certain
coastal shipping companies and many Coast resi-
dents, and from those who want everything
hauled, dragged, pulled and propelled to Sydney ;
but it would prevent the railway congestion which
is an everyday complaint, and would stop the
further gorging of a bloated and overgrown capital
at the expense of the man over the dividing range.

Consider the gentle missionary how he is alleged
to mish. Says the Fiji Times
Whpn the London Missionary Society’s yacht, John
Williams, left AUutaki (Cook Islands), on October 13, after
proceeding eight or 10 miles it was discovered that a
stowaway' (a native woman) was on board, who wished to
visither friendsat Rarotonga, 140 miles distant. There
being a very stringent rule against carrying passengers,
the steamer put back, and it is alleged put the woman
into the sea outside the reef, five miies from the main-
land. The woman had to swim over the breakers on to the
reef, and wade over broken coral for some distance, when
she was discovered by a fishing canoe and carried safely
to the shore.
And not very long ago another disciple chained a
convert black girl to a post up north and belted
seven devils out of her. Seems as if the Church
were getting its punch back. If the police force or
the Law or the Union Jack doesn’t get in an upper
cut soon, the chances are that the white chokered
syndicate in Queensland or the Islands will put
fried nigger on the menu.
Lloyd-George, Chancellor of the British Ex-
chequer and a strong Freetrader, assures Britain
that if his crowd gets back to power the people
will “ have the highest wages, the lowest hours of
work and the cheapest conditionsof life inEurope.”
Cobden and his followers have been saying the
same sort of thing for two generations, and it is
time the promise materialised. There is room for
improvement. On the same day that Lloyd-
George’s garish promise was published a Sydney
paper reported General Booth as saying that
2000 homeless folk sleep out at night on the
Thames Embankment alone. The General added:
The majority of these men would work if any work
were offered. Why, look what happened in the winter of
1905-6, when there were exceptional snowfalls during the
night. A call for extra street-sweepers was sent to men
lying in our great Blackfriars shelter. Men were aroused,
and of the hundred selected volunteers—many of them
rushed naked from bed rather than lose a chance—only
one was found unsatisfactory. He had just got a little
too far. He toiled as long as he could that day, but
dropped, and was carried to the hospital.
These people have two at least of Lloyd-Gkorge’s
promised blessings—short working hours and
cheap living. And they don’t seem satisfied.

It is a solemn reflection on the farmers and land-
owners of Australia that the Victorian Govern-
ment, urged thereto by irrigation expert Elwood
Mead, is about to send an agent to California to
attract irrigationists this way. Mead says he has
room for 30,000 practical agriculturists with their
families, and he has no hope of getting them in
the Commonwealth. The example of successful
irrigationists would do more to stimulate Austra-
lian farmers than any amount of speech-making,
wherefore he wants to quit talking and get in
some living lumps of eloquence. Our land, he
declares, is one-third cheaper than in California ;
it is equally productive, and the winters are shorter
and less rigorous. But one important thing seems
to have been overlooked. Production isn’t every-
thing : the present profits of fruit-growing
in Western America are large because the
system of distribution is organised, and there
is a large home market reserved to the
producers. Still, giving thatin, Mead has merely
bumped against the same trouble that struck the
State when it put up the Maffra beet-sugar factory
—farmers will not give their energies to close
cultivation on small areas so long as they can get
big areas for wool-growing and stock-raising.
Only a large increase of population, a disruptive
land-tax, and a large, reserved home market can
correct that tendency. When these things arrive
the day of the close cultivator will come, and he
will make money.

“ Poneke,” from Maoriland
Though Hori Grey and others took part in the earlier
Federal Conventions, Maoriland grave only scant atten-
tion to the matter when the Constitution was being
finally fixed up. It did nothing, in fact, beyond appoint-
ing the usual commission to" inquire into the matter,
which meant bringing down the same old report —
“ Things ain’t as bad as they might be ; so let’s keep on
as we are.” The truth was that just at that time God’s
own country was suffering mightily from swelled head,
owing to a “ prosperity ” that was due, in part at least,
to the construction of railway and other public works
with borrowed cash. Thus the natives acquired the
habit of gazing pityingly on any poor stranger ; and the
idea of joining with a country which: suffered from
drought and had no hot springs was too ridiculous for
words.
But that was some years ago. To-day, Maoriland is
waking up, and many people are beginning to think that,
after all, they at least might have given Federation a
little more attention. The fact that the Dominion is to
have the glory of being associated with the Chow-British'
naval squadron has raised considerable dust, which is
annoying not only to the man in the street but also to
that section of the press which isn’t wholly given over to
the “one flag, one Hempire” fever. These people are
beginning to have a suspicion that a strong Australasian
squadron, in which Maoriland would have some say,
would be the proper thing, and that the present fool
arrangement assures the Dominion no naval protection
at all. There isn’t any definite movement yet towards
undoing the foolishness of the past, and negotiating with
Australia ; but with the birth of a straight-out Labor
party that movement won’t be long before it starts.
DIPLOMATIST AND FOOL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Well,” said Mr. Hughes, “ I see nothing for Congress
to do. Mr. Wade has taken charge. He is like Louis XVI.,
Vet at e’est moi—l am the State, lam the Congress. He
is everything. He is the Pooh Bah. Let him run the
entire show. I have very much pleasure in nominating
Mr. Wade —I invest him with full control of the strike,
and I will retire, like Cincinnatus to his plough, and go
back to my cow.”— Sydney Telegraph (Sl/131’09).
The Diplomat was fuming at the capers of the Fool;
He waved one arm unto the sky, the other tore his wool.
“ This is,” he cried, “ disheartening ; I never knew such
rot.
When me and Peace is makin’ friends we both gets
knocked to pot.
The Cow ! The Cow !
. I wish I had him now—
I’d belt him good and hearty
For being such a smarty
As to try and ape my part. He
Is a Cow !
“Well, then,” he said, disgustedly, “ the Fool can run
the show —
He can drive her to the Devil ; I will let the ribbons go ;
Let her tumble down the hillside ; give the blessed thing
her head —
What’s the good of steerin’ careful when the Fool is never
dead?
Here’s how ! I bow
To the everlasting Cow !
To the she-bull calling madly ;
Oh, it wants attention badly ;
I’d kick the blighter gladly—
Curse the Cow !
“ I have the greatest pleasure in stating loud and clear
I’ve found the Gifted Leader, and to Glory he will steer !
He’s the long-sought four-leafed clover; he’s the fancy of
the flock ;
And he’ll point the way to Heaven, and its gates he will
unlock.
The Cow ! The Cow!
The milk pail and the plough I
No more I’ll graft and hustle
To hold Peace by the hustle,
I’ll go and use my muscle
On the Cow ! ”

“The Catch of the Season,” which was
staged on Saturday at Her Majesty’s for the first
time in Sydney, possesses the innocuous shadow-
plot of its kind. It is based on the fairy-story of
“Cinderella,” which, when one comes to think of
it, is just the sort of story on which a musical
comedy ought to be based. The two main attri-
butes of every fairy tale—viz., incredibility and
entire absence of anything resembling passion-
are also inseparable from musical comedy. The
iieroine of "The Catch of the Season,” Miss
Angela Crystal, is a charming school-girl who
is despitefully treated by her step-mother
and step-sisters. Lady Caterham, a truly amazing
specimen of the aristocratic British female, event-
uates. In so far as her exuberantly genial tem-
perament permits, she expresses disapproval of the
scurvy treatment that is meted out to Angela by
her relatives. She prances to a bell, operates
upon it, and a stage-footman appears. After
executing certain gyrations before the immobile
figures of this strange being, Lady Caterham
prods him smartly with a poker and urges him
to usher in a bevy of musical shop-girls. These
enter cheerfully, bearing milliners’ boxes. The
boxes contain wearing apparel for use by
Angela at the Dowager-Duchess of St. Jermyn’s
forthcoming ball. Angela is not to go to the
Duchess’s entertainment as herself, but as one
Mollie O’Halloran, an Irish maiden with a severe
brogue. Lessons are given to Angela in the correct
method of saying “ bedad,” “ begorra ” and other
phrases from the Erse speech, after which she is
adjudged fit to deceive the world in the capacity
of an O’Halloran, The shop-girls break alertly
into a dance and retire.
* * * *
Angela and the Duke, who have already
met and fallen aloofly in love with one another,
meet some more and assure an unconvinced audi-
ence that they are even more delirious on the
subject of each other than heretofore. She sings
and dances; he sings and dances; they sing and
dance together; the entire co. follows suit;
individual members of the company step from the
ranks and sing and dance, now on their own, now
with the Duke, now with Angela. And so on
till the hour of the theatre tram or boat draws
nigh, when the Duke and Angela are married
amid a blaze of light and color and song.
* * * *
The construction of “The Catch ” is hope-
less. The Characters meander on mostly by twos
and threes, and conduct lengthy chats which are
rarely funny enough to excuse the fact that
they hold up such action as the piece
possesses. To redeem the show from inanity
it is necessary that the principals should
be extremely good. The majority of them
are. Andrew Higginson doesn’t exactly suggest
the Duke of the society novelist’s dreams, but he
is none the duller for that. As a matter of fact,
what he does suggest is a cheery, waggish, full-
blooded young indent-clerk at the annual picnic
of the firm which employs him. He radiates quips
and smiles and Cockney gags and nervous energy.
Every now and then he breaks into a comic song.
He is a perfect devil among the girls; but he is
so absorbed being humorous that he has little time
for love-making. When he has to love-make he
goes through with the business in a perfunctory
manner, as one yearning to get back to his
proper metier. He does all these things in the
briskest possible fashion, and uses his fine baritone
voice as capably as he does his unimpeachable
legs. Miss Fanny Dango is so appealing a little
Angela that it is hard to picture any real-life step
or other relations behaving inconsiderately to her.
One imagines that she would only have to float up
to the churlish ones with her toy rabbit in her
arms and carol a stave from her wide repertory
to bring them to her feet in abject repentance. She
is the most graceful and alluring circumstance in
the show. Her sister, Miss Lydia Flopp, who plays
Sophia, has the family gift for dancing and so
forth, and acts nicely. Miss Florence Vie makes
her first appearance in Sydney as Lady Caterham.
She is a robust young woman with a robust
acting method that is effective in this part. Miss
Fanny Bauer “ walks on ” after an absence of
years, and sings Messager’s “I am waiting ’’ very
charmingly. Fred Leslie, Victor Gouriet and
baritone O’Connor play minor parts well enough.
A clever youth is Roy Seaton, who achieves the
rare feat of making a low-comedy page genuinely
amusing. The music of “ The Catch ”is sorry
stuff for the most part, arid the chorus-singing is
below the Williamsonian average.

On and after the 28th “The Climax” is
to be run at Her Maj. as an afternoon show.
** * *
At Sydney Royal on the night of Boxing
Day, Julius—he of the incomparable presence,
calves and voice—is to re-appear in a revival of
“ The Corsican Brothers.” He will portray both
brothers. There is but a brace of brothers in this
fine old play ; otherwise Julius would portray
more, the number of brothers whom he is com-
petent and willing to represent at a pinch being
practically illimitable. In the afternoon of the
same day Miss Florence Young will, at the same
playhouse, burst or explode upon Sydney in
serious drama. She proposes to do.this thing in
“The Climax,” a more or less musical thriller
of N’Yark extraction.
“The Girl Behind-the Counter” arrives
at Sydney Criterion on Boxing Night. The
management, which is old and experienced ,enough
to know, claims in its newspaper advts. that this
Girl is “all that she ought to be” —a comforting
notification. This musical outburst will be in the
nature of a swan song. When it is a co.
which has fractured more hearts and cheered more
florists than any that has operated in Sydney for
years will drop dead—which is to say disperse
and go away. It is too sad to bear thinking
about. Apropos of which a grand or Mammoth
Musical Festival will transpire at the Cri. on
Christmas night. Anyone who is of a devotional
turn of mind, and, withal, possessed of either 35.,
2s. or Is., may force an entrance.

George Marlow’s company announced on
Tuesday that it would no longer Marry the Wrong
Man at Sydney Palace, and that it was going to
finish up with “East Lynne,” which might be
described as “ Bolted with the Wrong Woman.”
For when a healthy villain and robust murderer
like F. Levison flees with a beautiful but
weeping scrap of chiffoned humanity like
Lady Isabel he becomes an object of regret, and
the human hat ought to be passed round for his
benefit. Fortunately, the days of “East Lynne”
will be short in the land, and on Boxing pay Hugh
Ward and Grace Palotta and Rose Musgrave and
Celia Ghiloni take possession of the Palace with
“A Bachelor’s Honeymoon.”

The film is rapidly becoming a disease—
the writer feels the insidious progress of it himself.
Unless the pictures have been visited at least
once in the week, there is a sense of emptiness be-
fore meals, the craving of an appetite unsatisfied.
Spencer, at Sydney Lyceum, has a fine series
of films, one of the best of , which repre-
sents the raid of Napoleon’s troops into
Germany to capture the Due d’Enghien,
and the subsequent murder of that inoffensive
branch of royalty. It is hard to say whether even
that brilliant film attracts more than the atmo-
sphere of sunlight and wind-swept water that
pervades the series showing the 18ft. cham-
pionship on Sydney Harbor a fortnight
ago. It is a charming picture; so is
the splendid fake-film in which the aerial
warfare of the future is demonstrated. West’s
Pictures at the Glaciarium are also drawing huge
crowds which dote upon the doings and adven-
tures of one Jim Blackwood, a jockey. It is a
stirring yarn. So is the scientific film dealing
with the wonders of nature, a series that is calcu-
lated to reduce the swelled head of humanity
to an unusual extent. It is, in fact,
a crusher to the man that has hitherto
regarded himself as the hub of the universe.
Down at the renovated and vastly improved
‘Bijou the programme is exceptionally well varied.
The management runs its show on the sandwich
line, and a slice of douching pathos is interlarded
between two slabs of broad comedy. The effect
is good.
** * *
The new Williamsonian panto., which
dawned upon Melbourne at Her Majesty’s last
Saturday, is a crowded incoherency with Japanese
trimmings, weaker in construction, but not less
gorgeous in effect than its notable predecessors.
A pantomime, in the first place, is what the
management makes it; secondly, it is controlled
by the principal performers; and thirdly, the
nominal author has a say in the matter. First im-
pressions of “ Aladdin ” are distinctly favorable as
regards the management’s efforts. The mumming
strikes one as being very open to development,
whilst the “book” is obtrusively foolish. Its
banalities are irritating ; its maltreatment of the
old fairy tale has no redeeming circumstances of
broad humor or quaint turns of fancy. Worst
fault of all in this strange eventful history
of Aladdin is a violent transition of the
Japanese hero from the shadow of the Pyra-
mids to the Australian Bush. Being tempo-
rarily disconnected from his wonderful lamp, the
shapely female son of Widow Twankay proclaims
himself a devoted child of the Commonwealth,
and sings his readiness to meet the Yellow Peril,
if necessary, what time a number of sweet girl
scouts ascend an ingenious wooden scaffolding in
the neighborhood of Flinders-street station or
somewhere, and unfurl themselves into a brilliant
representation of the Australian flag. The one
thing wanting to complete the national character
of this startling interpolation is a figure of George
Reid, hanging angelwise from the clouds and
spreading his sheltering wings over the back-
ground. Finally, Aladdin returns from Melbourne
to Japan, and celebrates his nuptials with the
inevitable Princess amidst the glories of a Chry-
santhemum Fbte.
* * A' *
One of the comic things that happen
irrelevantly in the first half of the panto, is a re-
setting of the old bathing-machine joke. Aladdin’s
mother and his uncle and others, likewise his
faithful donkey and the Emperor of Japan retire
to undressing rooms in a Turkish bath and frivol
somewhat tediously. A pretty entr'acte effect is
a balloon freighted by Miss Nance Maher, who
warbles a sentimental ballad in a strenuous
soprano. The bright particular incident of the
second half, and the most artistic feature of the
whole performance, is the acrobatic “turn” of
Price and Revost. One of them jumps and somer-
saults with remarkable grace, whilst the other
appears as a paralytic scarecrow and practices
every conceivable method of tumbling off a table.
Their joint entertainment, though not novel, is
surpassingly adroit and excellent. For the rest,
there are ballets, processions and what not—
beautiful assortments of legs, changes of raiment
and schemes of coloring. Nothing is quite so
refreshing as the summer-to-winter ballet in
“Jack and Jill,” but there is much to charm the
eye and tickle the emotions.

wards and upwards from her bounteous measure-

Abanazar in a purely commercial manner, with a
passionless American accent; but perhaps he will
begin to be funny when Harry Phydora comes to

Phydora from the turmoil on Saturday, and.

THE BRUTES.
THE GIRL : “ Jones’ wife died last and I
saw the notice of his death in this morning's
paper."
THE BOY : “Poor chap! His joy was short-
lived."
The dusky potentate at Melbourne Royal
was to have slain Mrs. Othello for the last time on
Wednesday night, and up to the moment of going
P re §f this paper hadn’t received an urgent wire,
notifying any change in the bloodshed pro-
gramme; therefore it may be assumed that
to-pight Asche will, for the first time, demand his
lib. of Gentile meat in “The Merchant of'
Venice.” This evening’s production of the play
is to enable dearly-beloved patrons to view “ The
Merchant ” before stealing away on a Christmas
holiday; also it will have the purpose of
saving “ Othello ” from further senseless objec-
tions from sensitive people. Of late the terrible
fifth act of the tragedy has caused a' little
feeling, and the culmination of anguish was
reached when a Melbourne paper suggested that
the act should be toned down, or cut away alto-
gether. To tone it down would be to tone down
the Moor and imply that his tint is only the
cork-smudge of a Christy minstrel. But to cut it
out would be an unpardonable act of assassination.
It would leave the play dead and purposeless, and
shear the frenzy of its climax.

These are the last nights of “ Hamlet ” at"
Melbourne King’s, The drama has not been a
strong allurement to the fastidious patrons of
William Anderson ; nor has it aroused the serious
students of William Shakspeare. The lovers of
the first Bill prefer blood, corpses and comic
relief; and the adorers of the second would like a
more intimate acquaintance with their divinity,
and a more finical taste for scenic reality. Yet,
despite these solemn portents, Bentley and Co.
will produce “ Macbeth ”on Boxing Night. This
is to happen at the Princess’s Theatre, as the
King’s playhouse is already engaged for the
Andersonian panto., “ The Babes in the Wood.”
“ The Babes in the Wood ” is to appear on Boxing
afternoon, and will refute any disgraceful sug-
gestion that there is Wood in the Babes. For
Nat Clifford is to effervesce after a long absence
from Australia; and Miss Lilian Lea, a recently
imported principal boy, is to display a voice and
bearing said to be as unsurpassable as her instep,
which was lately photoed in the papers.

Other holiday attractions in Melbourne
will include shows at the King’s and Royal on
Christmas Night, and at the Town Hall and Bijou
on Boxing Night. At the King’s, “The Life of
Christ” will be unrolled by means of the flicker-
graph ; and at the Royal there will be a festival
of music, song and story. At the Town Hall
wrestler Hackenschmidt will reappear, assisted
by “ Gooner ” Moir and several others ; while the
Bijou will present the turmoil of being “Married
to the Wrong Man.” This matrimonial common-
place is being furiously advertised by pictures of
the marriage and the subsequent events. One
picture depicts Mrs. Newlywed with such an
agonised mien that it is supposed her hus-
band has been eating biscuits in bed and the
crumbs have made an acre of couch uninhabitable.

At the Melbourne Temple of Rickards
some fresh idols are urgently requested. The
only really first-class deities in the place at pre-
sent are the Kremka gymnasts; Franco Piper,
the banjoist; and, perhaps, Bert Terrell, whose
girlishness is either a marvellous affectation or
else a very queer disorder. Smaller deities, or
godlings, are Harry Marte, the Wheelers, Brown
and Robinson, the Two Bells, Walter Emerson,
and Gwennie Hasto; but they are none of them
capable of working wonders.
Spencer’s Theatrescope opened its Mel-
bourne branch at the Olympia on Saturday
evening. A huge concourse was present to bless
the proceeding, and was fed on a programme of
music, picture and chronomegaphone. The last
was probably the chief attraction, but it was soon
shown to be of plebeian gramophone ancestry, and
not of patrician birth at all. At intervals it re-
leased the voices of Harry Lauder, Albert Whelan
and Frank Stanley, what time those comedians
capered on the screen, but as its enunciation was
not perfect its show-value is less than its name
implies. As regards the pictures, they comprised
some imposing glimpses of waterfalls in Idaho
(U.S.A.); some dramatic studies much to the
taste of the congregation ; some comedy films, of
which “Three to Chose From” was a capital
item ; and, lastly, the much-boomed version of
“Othello,” which would be better if Othello
didn’t pretend to cut his throat with a wooden
dagger.
Amy Castles and her strong little vocal co.
have started some seasonable oratorio at Adelaide
Exhibition, with the local Choral Society in sup-
port. The Tivoli show, or most of it, has moved
on to Westralia, but Athmore Grey remains.
Opinions vary greatly about her dancing; some
find it thrilling, others improper, others merely
dull. (The present writer is one of the last-named
crowd.) Athos has arrived to skate, and Hassan
to do magic things, but the well-beloved seals
have left a gap that takes a lot of filling. Ander-
son is crowding the Royal with “Gipsy Jack ” at
cheap prices, the strong-jawed Mounier and Franz
are at the Empire, and innumerable schools are
ending up their year with concerts. Also the
Pierrots at Glenelg have (broken out into comedy.
The old punning “Hook and Eye” is their first
venture in that line.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Silas S.” : Witnessed the bitter disappointment off a
disused actor man in a Melb. suburban bar or* a
recent Saturday night. He entered, but with the
undeniable air of the footlights about him. “Gentle-
men,” he said, in sepulchral tones, “if you willi
give me the small sum of threepence, I will recite for,
your edification ‘ Denver’s Dream.’ ” Brown, the book-
maker, drew out a “tray-bit.” “Hold hard!” ejacu-
lated Jones, the slightly inebriated lawyer’s Clerk, “ I’lll
give you sixpence if you won’t.” The bookie was hurt..
He banged the counter. “ I’ll give you ninepence to,
recite ‘ Denver’s Dream,”’ he said. Jones stood his
ground. t “ Eighteenpence not to,” he said firmly. “Two
shillings for the recitation ! ” cried Brown. “Half a
crown ! ” said the lawyer’s clerk. “ Three shillings ! ” bid
the bookie. “ And sixpence! ” said Jones. The Fore-
most Hamlet of his Day went pale with expectation, and
the bidding continued briskly. “Three and six!” said
Jones. “Four!” “Four-six!” “Five!” “Five-six!” The
recitation was run up to 10, and then the lawyer’s
clerk funked on it. “No,” he said, “it’s cheaper tO'
run!” And he fled. The bookmaker, noting the
absence of competition, fell back upon the alleged law of
supply and demand, and holding out a tray bit, said,
“ Here j'pu are, 3d. for the recitation.” We got it for 3d.
“ Oby ’’: The Royal Hotel, in George-street, Sydney, in,
the vestibule of which so many of the city’s early dra-
matic performances were given, did not ambition to be a
hotel at the beginning of its career, as has been recently
stated. The house was erected as a theatre, but when,
it was ready Governor Darling refused to issue a license,
fearing, as he alleged, the appalling degradation that-
would ensue if actors and actresses were encouraged. The
proprietors therefore turned the place into a hotel.
When it had pubbed awhile Governor Bourke consented
to license it as a theatre, but the drink business was so-
profitable that only part of the premises was given over
to the Thespian job or industry. Darling was not so
very far out with regard to some of bis apprehensions.
When, nearly 80 years ago, Dr. George Bennett visited,
the theatre in the Royal Hotel he found the “Heir at
Law’’being played to about 150 persons. Actors and
actresses gagged so freely as to completely distort the
text, and behaved with open indecency. The spectators-
in pit and boxes (there was no gallery) helped with ribald
remarks, and now and then broke into free fights. How-
ever, Dr. Bennett records that he got out without his.
pockets being picked, which encouraged him to hope that
the drama would see better times in Sydney.
A tragedy has engulfed Sarah Bernhardt in Paris, and
the gay capital is threatened with violent eruption. The
divine one is a wholesale user of the local “ worst tele-
phone service in the world,” it seems, and when it was a
bit worse than usual she “managed to be pretty rude,,
but not as rude as I could have been ” to one of the atten-
dants. Her service was instantly cut off with a laconic
official intimation of “For ever.” Sarah says she has:
lost the joy of her life, and Niobe isn’t in it with her for
grief. It is expected that the stricken mummeress’s-
threat to instantly retire from the stage will bring the
Government to its senses.
“Melb.”: Judkins’s last theme at the Wesley Church
“ Pleasant Sunday Afternoon ” was “ Who is Responsible
for Sunday Concerts?” My reply is, “You are.’’ He
says “ The Government.” Listen to my case : The
Wesley Church “Pleasant Sundays ” launched the whole
business. They have an orchestra of 20 playing operatic
and dance music. In my casual visits I have heard the
following there on Sunday : selections from the operas of
“Carmen,” “La Favorita” and “Lucia di Lammer-
moor”; the ballet music from the opera of “Robert
le Diable,” and a gavotte. Also the song of
“ Sweet Spirit, Hear My Prayer,” from “ Lurline,”
taken by the audience to be a hymn. All very
innocent, you will say. Just so. But when entrepreneurs
offer such innocence on Sunday nights, there is an out-
cry. However, Parliament is to decide. We are not
going to be stoushed, as in Sydney. I will admit the
necessity of raising the standard in some of the Sunday
shows. But there they stick. Sabbath desecration is
bosh. The right expression is a decent Sunday. The
most extraordinary Sunday show ever I saw' in this coun-
try was when John Wren granted the Ascot Racecourse

ing concert by the Cinderella Pantomime Co. Ten
thousand people went, and I thought I was in Chicago.
“ Harrison O.”: A retrospect of the work of the Aus-
tralian theatres for the past twelve months isn’t calcu-
lated to make one cheerful. Until the arrival of the
Asche-Brayton co. an irritating mediocrity reigned
supreme. It found expression in “ The Flag Lieutenant,”
which w'as a good sample of the super-Hi nglish play of
to-day. London has had a glut of them, with such
calamities as “ Mrs. Dot,” “The Fires of Fate ” and “ The
Explorer,” to name a representative trio. Other plays,
even lower in the scale than “ The Flag Lieutenant,” have
breathed the same distressing mediocrity. “Sweet
Kitty Bellairs.” “Lucky Durham ’’and “ The Breed of the
Treshams ” —none of these can be condemned as really bad
plays when one considers the depths of inanity to which
the drama has in the past descended ; yet the most benevo-
lent critic could not describe any one of them as good.
The only new plays of any note that w T e have had the
chance to inspect during the year have been “An English-
man’s Home ” and Henry Arthur Jones’ “ The Hypo-
crites.” . The last-named has made us wish for more
Pinero and Jones and, if possible, Shaw, and less Walter
Howard. Maugham, Belasco and the rest. It is a painful
circumstance that Pinero has, during the last three years,
written three more or less notable plays—“ His House in
•Order,” “ The Thunderbolt” and “’Mid Channel,” and
we have not had the opportunity of witnessing even one
of the three. And as for a Shaw season, it seems about
as remote as the millennium. As it was in 1908, so also
in 1909, the best productions were revivals. We have had
“ The Silver King,” “ The Village Priest,” “ She Stoops to
Conquer” (“improved” by the insertion of new and
original “ gags ”) and “ The Bells.” Other revivals of less
merit have been “Sweet Nell of Old Drury, “ Struck Oil ”
and, of course, “A Royal Divorce.” Besides Oscar Asche,
Walter Bentley and Nellie Stewart have exploited the
Bard during the year, and for their sins are hereby for-
given. There have, as yet, been np signs of the growth of
a National Australian Drama, but Jo Smith (“ The Bush-
woman ’’), Duggan (“ The Man from Outback ”), Lee
(“Out on the Castlereagh”), and Randolph Bedford
<(“ White Australia”) have shown that they can turn out
tripe that is equal to the best imported cow-stomach of
the kind. Of the year’s batch of bellow-drainmers and
musical comedies, the least said the better.
“The Whip,” Williamson’s latest acquisition for Aus-
tralia (which seems to ’indicate that the Firm intends
taking up the discarded garment of Bland Holt) is a
shocker of the old Drur.v-iarie type. The show revolves
round horse, after Nat Gould’s illogical and improbable
style, and the “sensations” include a motor-car smash,
a railway collision, a realistic representation of Tussaud’s
Chamber of Horrors (wherein the comic man, imper-
sonating' a horror, overhears the villain’s fell intentions),
a real horse race, a big hunting supper, and a scene at
the horse show (with real horses). The Bulletin is
pleased to hear that the funny man is a horror. The
.funny man seems to have found his level at last.
THE NOBLE ROMAN.
WADE THE MISOU[?]KH : “ Liberty and Freedom!
Tyranny is dead! ”
The Sydney Liedertafel burned the last ember of its
season at the Town Hall on December 15 in a smoke con-
cert. Members attended in larg-e numbers and sat smok-
ing in groups at tables scattered over the sawdust-strewn
floor, while in the galleriesdheir women folk drove off the
smell of burning weeds with swinging fans. Smoking and
Liedertafel don’t seem to go well together, and even the fre-
quent intervalsdid not result in removing a feeling of unfit-
ness. Either it should have been Liedertafel in the Town
Hall, biled shirts, ladies and no tobacco, or smoke-concert
in the back room of The Blue Duck, Fred Bluett’s songs
with all joining in the chorus and a bob in for drinks.
However, taken as a musical programme, it was a treat;
all the singers were in good voice, and the strong choir
was melodious as ice tinkling in amillion glassesof nectar
upon the counter of the gods.
“Melb.” rambles re pantos.:—Williamson’s forthcoming
production of “ Aladdin ” recalls to me the performance of
H. J. Byron’s “Aladdin, or the Wonderful Scamp” at
the old wooden Princess’s. On this version all succeeding
“Aladdins” have been based. The cast included : Alad-
din, Julia Mathews; Princess, DOII3' Green; Widow
Twankey, Fawcett; Emperor, Rogers; Abanazon,
;Stewart. (Coppin acted the Emperor many years after,
in a revival at St. George’s Hall, while the Royal was
being rebuilt after the fire.) Fawcett’s widow was
amazingly clever. Julia Mathews was the little Fairy
Star. Her song from Wallace’s “Lurline,” “Sweet
■ Spirit, Hear my Prayer,” drove the young bucks of the
■day crazy. Explorer Burke was her infatuated
■ adorer. She- it was who caused his mad rush over
this continent? Her father and mother were terrific
.lynxes. She married, ultimately, one Mumford, in
Maoriland. Later, at Oovent Garden, London, she
appeared as the Original English Grand Duchess of Gerol-
stein. Though she was a little woman with a little voice,
and had to sing in a vast barn of a playhouse, she scored
a big success. Arr early Melbourne Christmas pantomime
was “ Harlequin Conundrum Castle,” by Akhurst, at the
Queen’s, in 1854. The Royal opened the next year, and
its first panto, whs “ The Magician’s Daughter, or Harle-
quin King of the Goftien Island of Australia.” At the
-same time Coppin’s Olympic had “Harlequin LSD, or
the Demon of the Gold Mine,” and the Queen’s had
“ Harlequin King Blear.”
The smallest possible thing in the show line was men-
tioned last week in a Sydney court. The exhibition was
called '‘the three-legged Scotchman,” and the charge for a
view' of this Highland tripod was Is. It happened that the
Scotchman had only two legs ; but an extra man sat behind
a screen, and his bare leg projected and commingled
with the exhibit’s real extremities. The accused person—
the man who stood outside and urged the public to pay
up and enter—got off, on the ground that he u'asn’t a
member of the firm but only an employee. The balance-
sheet of that show should be interesting. After the rent
and the bill for properties and fittings had been paid, and
the “ firm ” had got its board and lodging out of the busi-
ness, and the man behind the screen had been mollified
with remuneration to prevent him suddenly withdrawing
his bare leg at the busiest time of the day, and the
Scotchman had been pacified to prevent him rising sud-
denly and walking aw'ay on two legs and leaving the third
leg sticking through the hole on its lonesome, how much
was left for the spruch-sprecher at the door, and which
terrace of houses did he buy with his savings?
D.”: The “old Mo” passed unobtrusively out of
London’s knowledge last month. It, together with the
land on which it stands, was bought at The Mart, Token-
house Yard and shops are to be erected on the site. The
Mogul, or Middlesex as it was latterly known, was the
last of the humble Caves of Harmony, or Halls, which
foreran the Empire, Alhambra and other luxurious haunts.
As recently as 12 or 14 years ago I remember being mildly
amazed by the discovery in this quaint place of an old-time
Thackerayan M.C., who sat on a raised chair in the centre
of the auditorium, announced the artists, kept
order, and drank with the favored patrons of the estab-
lishment. Already the aged place was on the down-
grade. A shilling admitted one to any part of the house.
The drinks were indifferent and the performers worse.
The tobacco consumed by regular frequenters was un-
speakable as to odor and pungency. Things were
not always thus. In the neighborhood of half a
century ago this hall attracted affluent audiences,
and the “ profesh ” deemed it an honor to appear there.
Dan Leno, about the only genius that the variety business
has evolved, performed for the first time on any stage at
the “ Mo.” He showed originally, curiously enough, not
as a patter comedian, but as a clog-dancer of extra-
ordinary skill and grace. G. H. Macdermott
sang his historical “By Jingo ” 1 there to rapturous
crowds of London “ swells,” and George Leybourne, a little
while afterwards, made the hit of years with “Cham-
pagne Charley.” Perhaps there has been as much bad
music, air, beer and tobacco absorbed within the four
walls of this doomed old playhouse as within any other
four roof-props in the Empire, and yet, somehow, an un-
reasoning pang afflicts me at the thought that the tainted
building is to be razed.
“L.H.P.”: W. S.. Gilbert, now aged 73, is announced
in the Fogland press as the librettist of a new comic
opera at the Savoy under Workman’s management. The
music is by German, whose “Emerald Isle,’ 1 ! “Merrie
England,” etc., are fairly well known. Gilbert has re-
peated the dodge he did in the case of “Princess Ida”
(founded on his own comedy of “The Princess”), and
has gone back to his fairy comedy, “The Wicked World,”
produced at London Haymarket in 1873, for his material.
“The Wicked World” failed to draw, and was the last of
Gilbert’s fairy comedies. These elf pieces were charm-
ingly original—“ The Princess,” “ The Palace of Truth,”
“ Thespis ” (the germ of the Savoy operas), and,
best of all, “ Pygmalion and Galatea ” (if it could
be fairly included in the list); but the vein was
a shallow one, and was soon exhausted. Still, for a while
after Sothern’s popularity had waned, they helped to keep
the Haymarket and John Baldwin Buckstone financially
afloat, and make Mrs. Kendal’s reputation. She was the
original Galatea and Zeolide (“Palace of Truth ”). “ The
Wicked World ” contains some fine writing, particularly
a speech (too long to quote here) on the privilege of Love.
“L.H.P.”: Oscar Asche, in his stage version of
“ Othello,” cuts out the first street scenes in Venice, and
the street scene in Cyprus showing the murder of
Roderigo. The latter idea may be commended as an
economy of time, for trams and ferry-boats wait for no
man ; but the omission of the first two scenes, so neces-
sary to a proper understanding of the play, is incompre-
hensible. Many people who do not know their Shakes-
bacon are in a fog as to what it’s all about.
This is probably the first time in its stage his-
tory that “ Othello ” has been so condensed.
By dropping these items Asche does the play in four
“sets”—viz., the council, seaport, courtyard and bed-
chamber—surely a record in stage production, and an
economical one too, as it saves the painting of three
scenes. Rignold, in his great production at Sydney
Criterion in March, 1899, did the tragedy in seven
scenes, and introduced the herald incident (omitted
in most acting versions) in Act 11., which he,
like Asche, devoted entirely to a “ set ” representing
“ A Seaport in Cyprus.” Irving, who often overdid his
Shakspearian mounting, broke this act up into three
scenes, labelled (1) “The Port of Cyprus,” (2) “A Street
in Cyprus,” and (3) “The Court of Guard,” the latter
showing.Cassio’s fall. But there is really no necessity for
this, as the one “set” can do duty for all the incidents
of the act. Wilson Barrett, who, like Rignold, did his
version in seven scenes, followed this idea ; but he cut out
the. Cyprus street-murder scene. Irving made this
incident a big feature, and put three scenes into
the fourth act : (1) Othello’s Castle, (2) A Street,
(3) Before lago’s House. But his version of nine
scenes was unwieldy and unnecessary. A curious
thing about all the above-mentioned managers is
that they would, in defiance of Shakspeare’s explicit
directions, “ Before the Castle,” place all the incidents of
Acts 111. and IV. in the interior of the castle. Edwin
Booth, in his second London season, in 1881, made the
seaport “ set ” do duty for the second, third and fourth
acts, until the London press jumped on him for the
absurdity of Othello letting loose his jealousy in a public
spot. Then he substituted a garden “ set ” for Acts 11.
and 111.
“Dagonet” Sims has been falling foul of “Arsene
Lupin,” the new French play with a Raffles-like hero. He
says that these gentlemanly burglars, besides being im-
moral, defy the probabilities. Cecil Raleigh, melodra-
matist, replied in London Daily Mail that “ plausibility
is not an absolute quantity that is either present or
absent. That is where the skill of the dramatist is
shown —in telling the story in such a way
that the public receives it. Could one say
for instance, that a story in which a ghost follows a
young man about, urging him to kill his uncle, was a
plausible story ? Yet that is the plot of ‘ Hamlet,’ and
Shakspeare made it plausible.” A story may not be
plausible ; but if the writer plausibly gives it an air of
plausibility, who can ask for more? Littlechild, the
great ex-detective, agrees with Sims. He says burglary
is a low branch of the profession, and the burglar is
almost invariably a low' type of man. Incidentally, Little-
child implied that the only romance of crime that is not
“far-fetched and fictional ” is that of Sherlock Holmes,
and that all detectives might read it with advantage.
The London music halls are steadily gathering in high-
class actors from the “ legitimate ” stage. According to
his own account, Seymour Hicks will spend 35 weeks a
year in the halls for the next two years ; the rest of the
time he will be back in his theatre. “ Why so much
variety work? Because it pays. At present one gets
more paragraphs than pounds in the theatrical pro-
fession. And when syndicates come in at the stage door,
art flies out at the dressing-room window.” Arthur
Bourchier, who goes in for heavier drama than
Hicks, argues that the late hour of starting
has driven the one-act play out of the theatre.
Not even the pit and gallery patrons now come
in time for a curtain-raiser, no matter how good it may
be ; and so managers “ put on somebody with a piano
and a few wheezes.” So “ because I find that I cannot
produce certain clever one-act pieces at my own or any
other regular theatre, Mrs. Bourchier and I have accepted
the offer of a fine engagement at the Palace.” Music
halls in England have been places where one could smoke
and drink during the performance ; and they have been
prosecuted (by theatre managers) if they gave any
dramatic piece that lasted more than 40 minutes. But
the present tendency is to w’ipe out the arbitrary dis-
tinction between theatre and hall, and let each house
give just whatever kind of a show it pleases.

THE PAUPERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Reading aloud bores the male inmates of the Woolwich
Workhouse, and at the next meeting of the guardians a.
sub-committee will recommend that the practice, which
is costing 12s. a week, be discontinued. . . . The most
thrilling romances, the most baffling detective tales, the
most enthralling stories of adventure left the pauper
listeners dull and listless. They yawned at Rider Hag-
gard. suffered Conan Doyle in gloomy silence, and were
indifferent to the charms of Wilkie Collins, Dickens,
Harrison Ainsworth, Captain Marryat, Clark Russell,
Rhoda Broughton, and Marie Corelli. —Daily Mail (Lon-
don, VB/10l'09).
The performance oV plays by London companies at
Windsor Castle have become regular annual events in
each recurring November since King Edward’s accession,
. . . Not more than 200 persons, including royalties, are
present on these occasions. The performance is given to.
an almost silent audience.— Same paper, same date.
The Pauper lolls upon his bench and yawns behind his:
hand ;
A menial with the latest book before him takes his stand,
And reads aloud in studied style
Of heroes great or villains vile,
The Pauper merely tips his tile—
And spits.
The Zulu fight that Raggard paints so faithfully and well.
The sleuth-hound scent of Sherlock and the Blood upon
the Bell,
Are all received with sniff and snore ;
Each tale of love, or sin, or gore,
The Pauper votes a beastly bore —
None fits.
Yet blame the listless pauper not for this unseemly thing;
The fashion at the workhouse is the fashion of the King.
When by command the players rave,
How does the audience behave ?
His Nibs is silent as the grave
At night.
When Henry V. at Agincourt calls loud on English pride,
Or Hamlet stalks to stab the Cow who stole his father’s-
bride,
Does Ed arise and wave his hook,
Or clatter as a laying chook ? f
Nay ; like the pauper, so the duke
Sits tight.

DANGEROUS OLD FASHIONS
Not to be Followed.
Old habits are often better than new
ones, but not always. For instance, the
old-fashioned method of cleaning the
teeth and mouth with tooth-powders
and tooth-pastes is a complete mistake.
Brushing the teeth with tooth-
powders and tooth-pastes can never
safeguard them from tooth-destroying
microbes; for the simple reason that
the parts which are most liable to
attack, the backs of the molars and the
fissures and interstices of the teeth—
the very parts where the microbes live
and thrive —are not
purified because .
they cannot be
reached by/
tooth - powders J
and tooth- 1
pastes. Only a
liquid dentifrice
can penetrate every-
where, and when it
o
is antiseptic it destroys all the enemies
which attack the teeth. Odol is such
a dentifrice, and has such a practical
antiseptic effect, that it effectively
arrests all bacterial inroads and fer-
mentation processes.
The complete disinfection of the
mouth and teeth resulting from the
use of Odol is especially due to a
remarkable property which this pre-
paration possesses and which causes
ft to be absorbed by the surface of the
mucous membrane and in thediqllows
of the teeth, so that it here deposits a
store of antiseptic matter whose action
continues for some hours. By regular
cleansing with Odol healthy teeth are
kept absolutely intact, and teeth
already impaired are preserved from
further destruction. For this reason
Odol must certainly be regarded as
the best of all known preparations
for cleansing the mouth and teeth.
SOCIETY
Sydney Evening Mews announces that
the coal strike is causing a dearth of tourists on
the N.S.W. South Coast. Going into detail, the
paper remarks :
One lady received a letter from a city gentleman engag-
ing a cottage for a month, but hearing that the miners
were referred to as a lawless class, he cancelled the
engagement, intimating at the same time that he was
given to understand that as soon as he landed on the
platform his food would be taken from him.
This illustrates the extremes to which the revolu-
tionary working classes will go. Think of it! A
poor stout gentleman, snatching a month or so in
which to rest, packs a few provisions into his
pocket to see him through his vacation—an onion,
a small piece of cheese, a crust, mayhap a flask of
whisky. So fortified, he hurries to Clifton with
all the elation of a simple, trusting child on holi-
day. On the train journey his joy in the smallest
thing is unbounded ; he throws a kiss to a chirrup-
ing bird, tips the guard a shilling. And all the
time hislittleround stomach wriggles at the thought
of the feast stowed away —that tantalising onion,
that white-fleshed crust! Clifton at last. The
banquet will be soon spread now, and—the little
fat man shrinks from the ring of vvolf-like faces
that surround the carriage door. His hands close
upon the pocket where his food is as a dozen
talons grasp him and shred his clothes for some-
thing to eat. His fat wallet is thrown aside, for
even famishing wolves cannot get nourishment
out of bank-notes; but tears, pleadings and
grovellir.gs save not for him the onion, the
crust. All his food is taken, and there upon the
platform a gang of lawless ruffians gorge them-
selves and pass the flowing flask while the cottage
engaged for the month and the landlady weep in
each other’s arms.

There used to be a union in the wholesale
rag trade of Sydney, but the members got quar-
relling among themselves, and the union burst.
While it continued burst that part of the public
which the rag merchants deal with had a pretty
good time, and got cash discounts and all sorts of
things. The rag merchants still made very fine
profits, but they knew that if they put their
heads and pockets together they could make still
more ; so Albert Borchard, the accountant, went
union-organising. He was a good organiser,
and at last, about six months ago, he got all the
big merchants linked up again into a happy family.
The first thing the happy family did, of course,
was to strike—it announced that it wasn’t going
to follow its lawful occupation of rag-selling any
longer unless it got more pay; and it didn’t.
There wasn’t any noise about it in the papers; all,
in fact, that the general public was ever told about
the strike was that “the reorganisation of the
Softgoods Warehousemen’s Association had been
successfully completed,” and that “to mark their
appreciation of his efforts, Mr. Borchard was yes-
terday presented with a handsome service of
plate.” Which shows the difference between
being an organiser of a fluff-merchants strike and
of a coal-miners’ strike. In one case you get a
brief buttery notice in the “Personal” column
and a hundred-guinea gift (the size of the gift
showed the success of the strike); in the other
you get lampooned in the papers and have a fair
chance of 12 months’ gaol.

“ Senga ” : I plodded into one of the N. S.
Wales coal areas some time ago, and struck
a “private township” for the first time. There
was no accommodation in the town, for every
“spare” room in the miners’ three-roomed
cottages was already occupied. So I decided
to build; and, selecting a site on the
40,000-odd acres embraced by the octopus,
I began to split the slabs for the humpy.
In the meantime a temporary shelter was made in
the scrub close by. After eight weeks toil 1
moved into the new home. On lining up for
pay (6s. Bd. a day) on the fourth pay Saturday,
I found myself docked Bs. for ground rent,
reckoned from the time of sinking the first post-
hole to date. A week or two later I put up
another bunk, ship fashion, to accommodate a
mate who had arrived. Next “ pay ”my ground
rent was sent up another shilling a week for the
boarder ! It is wonderful how promptly some of
these companies hear about it when you take in a
boarder. Assuming that the cp. was charging me
4 per cent, on the value of the land, it must have
reckoned the capital value of its bit of bush sur-
face at about £960 an acre.

One bumptious creature who turned up to
give evidence against Peter Bowling and co. testi-
fied that he was manager of a N.S.W.
mine which “employed” 80 or 90 men.
The men had only a verbal agreement.
This mine worked “some days every fort-
night.” Some weeks it only worked one day.
The other five days the men had no work and no
pay. He expected the men, though they had only
a verbal agreement, to give 14 days notice before
leaving off work. All the sp-me, he sometimes left
off work five times a week without giving any
notice. And the important person seemed quite
hurt when lawyer Gannon called his mine a
“ rotten hole.”

There was a greatly-puzzled jury at the
trial of J. W. H. Dennis, a South Australian
station-manager who brought out a gun to show
it to a cabman after a midnight drive home and
somehow shot him dead. The first verdict was
“Guilty of the careless use of firearms,” and his
counsel claimed that that meant “Not guilty” on
the murder charge. The jurymen were told to
say something more definite, and came back with
_“ We are agreed there was no criminal intent.
We think there was a certain amountof carelessness
in handling the firearm.” Everybody knew that al-
ready, and the Judge told them they really must say
“ guilty ” or “ not guilty,” accident or otherwise.
So they compromised on “Guilty of the careless use
of firearms —which, we take it, amounts to man-
slaughter—with a recommendation to mercy.”
Even then the Full Court had to be called
together to settle what that verdict amounted to ;
so°Dennis said he would rather accept it as man-
slaughter, and take anything the Judge thought
right. And the end of it all was a formal “ bind-
ing over” for 12 months and a fine of £35, the
cost of the trial. Dennis had already provided
for the dead man’s family.
A DEEP REVENGE.
“Sir, I told him that my representation of the
villain would make strong men curse and
women weep; and then the scoundrel insulted
me.”
“Ha! In what way!"
"He offered me 20s. a week to keep a curb on
my villainy.”
“ Did you strike the wrc[?]ch ! ”
“No, sir. I accepted his offer."
THE MUSICAL GAME.
SIGOR F[?]DKLINT (professionally engaged for juvenile party): “Is [?]s zee house of zee
child's play? ”
The snarl of Acting-Justice Docker in the
Sydney Criminal Court last week against disagree-
ing juries calls for some sort of snarl in reply. In
the case which produced Docker’s snort, the jury-
men, after a long consideration of the evidence,
announced that they couldn’t come to a decision.
Whereupon s’Honor said he remembered when
jurors were kept locked up until they did
agree. If Docker’s cure is good for jurors
who cannot agree, then it should also be
good for Judges who cannot agree. So
when the Full Court, as it may at any time, finds
a decision of Docker’s not in agreement with its
view of the facts or the law, Dock’s cure could be
given a fair trial. His ’Onor could be lined up
under the Sheriff's official, yelled at to answer to
his name, and then locked in a 10 x 12 room by
himself till he came to a better frame of
mind—that is, till his own opinions were tired
enough or hungry enough to prostitute them-
selves to the Fuil Court’s opinions. Then, if
Docker stubbornly chose to maintain his judg-
ment as being correct, he would die in his box of
old age, and while the public might commend the
deceased for his devotion to principle, it would
certainly condemn him for waste of expensive
Judge. It might possibly strike Docker that a
jury of 15 and a majority verdict would be a
simpler device. Compulsory agreement isn t
tried in other lines of business. If no member
could be elected until the constituency was
unanimous and no Bill could pass until Parlia-
ment was unanimous, the business of the country
would be bogged even worse than it is at present.

The N.S.W. Law Courts have been of late
engaged in settling a dispute between cabby and
his fare, the fare protesting against the charge
made by cabby. The High Court has just de-
livered a ponderous judgment on the dispute,
which originally arose over a matter of half a sov.
And you could buv droves of wild and tame cabs
out of the Costs. In melodrama the ownership of
the disputed estate is referred to the policeman
at the corner, and he looks at the documents
under a Street-lamp and decides right there. The
plan has a lot to recommend it.
“ W.J.8.” shakes his fist under a bishop’s
nose
At a recent Anglican Congress a bishop preached from
the text, “ If Christ came to Australia He would, as a
Colored person, be denied admittance ” ; and the sermon,
with alarming accretions, is still travelling through the
Commonwealth. I challenge the Congress, or a whole
boiling of Congresses, to a fair go to a finish in this matter.
Let them set forth, in language intelligible to the ordin-
ary layman, replies to the following questions :
(1) What chapter and verse of the Bible is there to
support Congress in its assertion that Jesus Christ was a
black man?
(2) Is not Christ represented in the religious paintings
that have been preserved, from the oldest known down
to Holman Hunt’s notable picture, as a white man of ex-
ceptionally fair complexion ? Has the Church discovered
any new evidence that justifies the reversal of this con-
ception ?
(3) Are Jews a black race ? Is any Congressman game
to tell an able-bodied Australian Jew that he (the Jew) is
a colored person? How many Jews have been refused
admittance to Australia on the score of their color ?
(4) The Church declares that the father of the Re-
deemer was the Holy Ghost. Was, or is, the Holy Ghost
bluck
(5) Will that bishop, or any other bishop, point out any
Act on the Australian statute book which excludes
colored people. He can’t, for there is none. Certainly
there iS an Act which provides an educational test, but
surely it is not that to which the bish. is referring. Even
the most blasphemou’s bishop would hesitate, one would
think, to declare that a mere educational test would shut
out the Omniscient.
(6) The Church tells us that the Redeemer was all-
powerful, a worker of miracles, one who could make Him-
self invisible and walk upon the waters. And at the same
time it speaks of Him as one who was so absolutely mortal
that a mere Customs officer could shut the door in His face
with impunity. Has the Church no faith at all in its own
teachings?, Does it believe that its doctrines are all
false pretences ?
Will any congress or boiling of congresses oblige
this gentleman with a reply ?

The private trustee, as compared with the
trustee co. or public trust office, got a very bad
advertisement the other day, and _the matter
seems to have given complete dissatisfaction all
round. Twenty-one years ago the late Alexander
Oliver and a Sydney business man named Russell
were looking .after the affairs of a cer-
tain infant or certain infants. They invested
£lOOO of the money on mortgage of land at
Dora Creek in the scrub country near Newcastle,
Sunday Brunker being the valuer who certified
that the security was good. Oliver also nad a
personal knowledge of the land. The security
didn’t keep good—in fact, the slump was terrible;
and the beneficiaries claimed, the other tniyin the
Equity Court, for their lost money. Oliver is
dead, Brunker is too ill nowadays to do busi-
ness, and Russell, who apparently never had any
personal knowledge of the property, had to do his
best to explain the 21-year-old transaction, ihe
judgment was for £ll7l, lost capital and interest,
against Russell and against Oliver’s estate—that
is to say against Mrs. Oliver. It is especially
rough on the last-named, and it is a sudden
reminder that a widow is liable to be ruined
by the unexpected resurrection of old for-
gotten trustee transactions which she had
never heard of, and which, probably, even
her dead husband had forgotten in his lifetime.
Altogether too much of the private trustee is
divided into two classes—the dishonest profes-
sional individual who spends the cash himself,
and the honest amateur person who muddles
it away and is then dragged into ;ourt and
ordered —personally or by his widow—to make the
loss good. Both are very unsatisfactory to the
orphan, and neither is very satisfactory even to
himself.
GOD IN HIS PLACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Dean of Newcastle telegraphed to the coal mine
proprietors (14/12/’O9), asking them if they would be will-
ing, in view of Christmas, to grant a truce of God tor a
specific time. . . ...
Mr. Learmonth, the following day in an interview with
the daily press, said he had sent a reply to the Dean ot
Newcastle that the Government was now taking action,
and so it was better to leave the matter of the settlement
of the present difficulty to them. The proprietors did
not believe in taking any action that would hamper the
Government in any way.
The Parson dropped him to his knee, his hands high in
the air ;
He looked upon the Bitter Fight, and raised his voice in
prayer,
Not unto God, but unto Fat-
Yes, it has really come to that —
They keep God waiting on the mat
Outside Fat’s lair.
“Coal Lords,” the kneeling Parson said, with lowly voice
and look,
“ Would you a truce of God accept, according to the
Book V
The Holy Day is come again,
The Birth of Christ and Mary’s Pain,
Just for a little raise your bane ...”
The Coal Lords shook.
They shook and trembled on their thrones above the
people’s head,
But it was rage, not reverence, that tinged their faces
red :
“ We want no bluff from Him on High ;
We’re in with Wade—he’s quick and fly
To give us what we want. Old guy,
You’d best go dead.
“ We do not want to interfere with Charlie Wade at all,
And if the Lord comes fooling round, He’s riding for a
fall ;
So there you have our solid views,
And, if you will advice excuse,
Try God His truce on Billy Hughes—
He’ll need it all.”

“Amoy ” lets down his pigtail and writes :
There is a deal of nonsense written about the Chinese
army. I have seen it in type that 500,000 men are being'
trained in China. This is a mere running-on of imagina-
tion. Foreign writers argue as to what must be, but it
is very different from what is. With all respect, Wolseley
was deficient in local knowledge when he said about 20
years ago that China and the United States were the
great coming Powers. The more or less efficient modern
Chinese army is about 70,000 strong. It is not being in-
creased: The Manchu dynasty is still regarded as a
usurping family by the bulk of China. The dynasty
doesn’t want to arm the people. The German Emperor,
in talking about the Yellow Peril, simply does not know.
Japan and China are hostile. The Japs are not taking a
lead in China, even in military affairs. To be sure, there
are thousands of Chinese students who have been in Japan.
At one time Tokio held 10,000; nothing- like so many
now. The wise men of China think Japanese influence
bad. Now, about the, army. Chang organised an army
and navy on a composite Chinese and European system.
Japan smashed this concern in 1894. After the peace of
Shimonoseki General Yuan was appointed, with European
aid, to make a modern army (there is another prominent
Yuan). The General did remarkably well. The soldiers
were all Northerners, tolerably big fellows, not smaller
than average Australians. Modern uniforms, with rifles,
artillery, telegraphs, and every appliance modern. Here
the pace, in drill and outfit, was kept with Japan.
When the Boxer troubles of 1900 came, Yuan
had 30,000 good men. He sat on a rail—neither
helped the Boxers (who had the sympathy of the
Empress) nor did he help the motley Waldersee force.
With the outbreak of the war between Russia and Japan.
Yuan was, of course, on the qui vine, and largely re-
cruited. Brought the Army up to 70,000 men, where
it remains. Both Russian and Japanese authorities speak
highly of it. Some arduous work was imposed upon it in
Manchuria, after the war. When the Chinese Emperor
died, Yuan was deposed from the generalship. Sus-
picion attached to him through not being a Manchu.
Before me are a dozen photos, of the latest field
manoeuvres by the Chinese army. At all events they look
equal to Germans or French. The Chinese railways are
now 3700 miles in working, 5000 more authorised, with
about one-quarter under construction. The railroad con-
nection of the German Kiao-Chau with Pekin is being
pushed on. There is railway communication right from
Harbin (Russian) to Hankow, via Pekin. So Pekin is
joined with Moscow and St. Petersburg. The connection
of Shanghai to Pekin is in progress. I have a railway
map of China, a remarkable study indeed. Observe the
pushing out for India, both via Burmah and Tibet.

From a man in Fiji: “I’m not much on
Little Bethel; but I reckon the harder you can
make it to get opium in Australia, the less popu-
lar will Australia be with the Chow ; and that’s
why I whisper in the ear of the Customs —‘Watch
the Fiji boats.’ You can get a bucketful of the
drug here any time you like ; yet people who
travel into Australia from Fiji are not keel-hauled
to any extent worth mentioning by the men whose
iob it is to smell out contra-
bind. And while they
are about it they might
keep an eye open for
smuggled Chow as well
as smuggled drug,
though as to that,
the Lord knows this
piebald island
doesn’t seem to
be losing any
of its
scum.”

The old house called Goderich, in Bays-
water-road (Sydney), a mansion built in the early
’thirties by Thomas Macquoid, is being demolished.
Mr. Macquoid, who was High Sheriff of New
South Wales, then including Queensland and
Victoria, suicided on the premises in October,
1841. His ghost didn’t haunt the property, or
else a clerical successor, Bishop Broughton, threw
his shovel hat at it and caused it to disappear.
Captain Smith came afterwards, and when he
;steered for the heavenly shore the old place was
: sold to the house-murderer.
WORSE STILL.
BLOBBS (gloomily): “ This place holds sad memories for me. My poor dear wife was
drowned here."
DOBBS: “ But — eh —yon married again, didn't you?”
BLOBBS (more gloomily): “ Yes. And nothing will induce my second poor dear wife to come

South Aus. Criminal Court has at last
booted out a foolish local practice that had sprung
up, nobody seems to know how or why, of
stating the occupation of every accused person as
“ laborer.” When a doctor and a station-manager
were labelled “laborers” within one week, Judge
Horn burg mildly asked “ Whaffor ? ” The Crown
Prosecutor could find nothing better to say than
that it “ has always been the practice”; where-
upon his Honor remarked that somebody might
take a day off and try to change it.
Sydney streets have a reminder of the fact
that Lord Augustus William Frederick Spencer
Loftus was once Governor of N. S. Wales.
The reminder is in the shape of the cab-
riolet which carried the old fowl-fancier in
his ambassadorial days in St. Petersburg;
When Augustus retired from Sydney 24
years ago he realised on everything,
from harness to hens. His ancient shay
is generally occupied nowadays by a
venerable lady, who is content to pro-
ceed at half the regulation pace. It is,
even at this late hour, a well-preserved
vehicle. By the way, the carriage
occupied by Lady Mary Fitzroy, wife of
Governor Fitzroy, when she met a tragic
death in a bolt in ’Parramatta Park,
was purchased by the late
Mr. Draper, of Redbank.
near Molong (W est e r n
N.S.W.). It was stored for
years in a shed, whence por-
tions of it were begged,
borrowed or stolen by curio
and relic hunters, until
neither a dash-board nor a
wheel remained for the fowls
to roost on. The pecu-
liarly designed silver handles
of the carriage doors were, however,
iiung on to by the Draper family.

The pretentious Rhodes scholar-
ship scheme is coming to be under-
stood even by the worshippers of
the plutocratic diamond-grabber.
London Fortnightly, looldng at
it from outside, designates it “A
bleeding of the intellect of the
countries that come within its
scope”—meaning thereby that the
youths who are taken away as Rhodes
scholars don’t go back to their native land.
Looking at it from the inside imperial standpoint
the Fortnightly argues that Rhodes would have
succeeded better in imperialising the dependencies
had he devoted his money to sending British
youths, educated in Imperial ideas, to official
positions in outlying parts of the Empire. Any-
way, there is no doubt that the Rhodes scheme
has tended, as far as it has gone, to bleeding the
intellect of Canada, Maoriland and Australia.
The Victorian Education Department has
won the prize for long-distance lethargy. Lately
it was asked to attach a head-teacher’s residence
to the State school at Meredith, and replied that,
“ owing to the present state of the Department’s
funds, consideration of the erection of a residence
has been deferred.” Which might be a reasonable
reply if it hadn’t been deferring the same question
ever since 1877. The people of Meredith, after
pounding on the Department’s lethargic door for
32 years, begin to realise that that branch of the
Government refuses to be hustled.
The restless housebreaker has struck a
regular bonanza at Yarraville (Vic.). Every
week for the last few months a list of robberies
from dwellings at Yarraville has appeared in the
Melbourne papers; but, up to the present, devil a
burglar or a portion of one has been seized. A
few nights ago some residents almost caught a
couple of marauders ; but very soon the pursuing
Yarravillians found themselves dodging bullets,
and by the time O’Callaghan’s heavy-footed forces
had been roused out of their lethargy the burglars
had had time to get away out to Box Hill or
China. Then the papers which described the
affair finished up with the stock remark : “ The
police have the matter in hand.” That seems to
be the trouble with the Yarraville police. They
have so much matter in their hands that it over-
balances them when they make their belated
attempts to capture, or seek out, evil-doers.
What the Yarraville residents would like to see
in their huge “ dooks ” is a trifle less matter and a
lot more burglar.

The ingenuity of people against whom
claims for damages are brought is inexhaustible.
In Maoriland there is a scale in the Compensation
for Accidents Act—so much fora lost leg, so much
for an arm, a finger, and so on. Labor Minister
Millar reckoned this would simplify things, and
enable the injured to obtain their rights without
the expensive and harassing litigation usually
involved. But the new scheme is combated at
every point possible by employers and insurance
companies. If a man gets a leg hacked off by a
machine, all the lawyers and doctors procurable
are brought to the court to prove that it wasn’t
much of a leg at any time. It appears that the
claimant’s lost limb was never reliable, that his
father and his great grandmother suffered from
all the complaints to which legs are heir, and that
if the machine had not taken the leg it must in-
evitably have dropped, off sooner or later. But
the limit was surely reached at Palmerston North
the other day. A drover had a valuable dog run
over and killed by a motor-car. He sued for
damages, and it was urged on behalf of the
motorist that the dog was on the wrong side of
the road ! The magistrate indicated that there
was no wrong side of the road for dogs, and
ordered the ear pilot to pay damages and costs
amounting to over £2O.

“ Petifi ” : I’m glad to see that at last a
Judge has been found sane enough to bring
down a timely fist on the finger-print fetich. A
Melbourne youth was recently charged with
burglary and annexation of a cash box. A
detective produced photographic enlargements of
the impressions of a thumb and middle finger
found on the loot receptacle; also photos, of the
impressions of the accused’s thumb and middle
finger. He was proceeding to say that the im-
pressions had been made by the same person
when Chief-Justice Madden horned in gently
to the effect that the statement couldn’t be
accepted as sufficient evidence of identity.
He made a similar remark to the jury, and in the
absence of any evidence apart from the finger
print the youth was acquitted. There are just
three serious doubts about the finger-print busi-
ness. (1) Certain people say that no two sets of
finger prints are alike, but as they haven’t
examined the fingers of the 1500 or 1600 millions
of people on this earth, they can’t know it, and it
seems very unlikely that Nature could contrive to
work so many perceptible variations in so small a
space. (2) It is just possible that finger prints
may be forged. (3) Even if no two prints are
alike, some of them must be so nearly alike that
only a gigantic intellect can spot the difference.
And policemen haven’t gigantic intellects. They
couldn’t be hired at the current rate of bobby-
remuneration if they had. Probably a sufficiently
large intelligence could prove that no two pieces
of blotting paper are really quite alike, but where
is the owner of that stupendous brain-tank?
“ San Remo ” : Where Randolph Bedford
made the mistake in his wool-sale story (B.
18/11/’O9) was in not explaining to the uninitiated
the reason for all the madness and excitement.
The first buyer to belch out the highest bid has
the lot knocked down to him. If 20 men leap to
their hind legs and roar out “Twelve,” and no
higher bid is forthcoming, then the first lunatic
who opened his battery in the rush gets the line.
The auctioneer has to keep his wits about him
when the bids are rattling out like the crackle of
a Maxim gun in action. I’ve seen a wool sale in
Brisbane with the thermometer IGOdeg. in the
shade. Lord, how the sweat poured out of those
foreigners, particularly the burly Teuton buyers !
When things got properly warm it just rained
ties, collars, handkerchiefs, coats, vests —even
shirts went by the board—and the once immacu-
lately dressed stood up in singlets and pants
shrieking their bids and trampling foreign under-
clothing to ruin.

Drew near, and looked in mine.

One never hears of a strike in Japan. Wages ! Yes,
the mothers and fathers receive about Is. 6d. for 12 hours’
work, the children (and more than half the labor is done
by the little children) receive about half this sum. The
fact of a mother having two children (infants) strapped
on her back is no impediment whatever. Crying babies
are unknown in Japan. At the tender age of three and
four they are employed in passing the empty little coal-
baskets back to the lighters for refilling.— Edifying item
from S. M. Herald.
Home of the fair and facile little Geisha,
Hub of the wakened East,
Symbol of Britain to the hordes of Asia
And scenic beauty-feast,
Your picturesqueness brings on mild aphasia—
Your habits are a Beast.
Here or in England, where so e’er men gather
Whose skins are white, they dog
With drastic penalties the type of father
Who has the heart to flog
His little ones to toil—holding that rather
The conduct of a Hog.
No cheers delight a member of those nations,
Which bound yours on the West,
Whose wife and babes are forced to earn their rations
’Mid navvies and the rest.
In fact, that sort’s held up to execrations ;
He is adjudged a Pest.
The thought of using babes for coal-removal-
Fills normal whites with heat,
Oaths deep and long—and likewise square and oval —
Would follow such a feat.
In one place only would it score approval—

Snakes are very plentiful this summer in
the Western Plains (Vic.) wheat country. Two
Bolac farmers recently went into their crops to
cut; a few thistles out of the way of the strippers.
The first man cut five thistles and five snakes, and
the second man had to slay four snakes while
negotiating three thistles. After that they
reckoned the open country was healthier. These
snakes will] make harvesting dangerous this year
for both the men and the horses. So the farmers
are proposing to insure their horses. Horses are
valuable.
ONLY SLIGHTLY
INTERESTED.
“ Here, girl, there’s a button in
the salad howl.”
“ Yes, sir! I noticed the cook
tying up his waistcoat with a hit of string."
“Terence”: Here’s an example of horse
memory that has come inside my own experience.
A three-year-old gelding was taken away from
his native Mudgee district, and ridden over the
Blue Mountains, via Penrith, to Wiseman’s Ferry.
For 13 years he wandered up and down the coast
between Sydney and Cape Hawke, staying a year
in one place, two or three years in another, and so
on. After 13 years’ absence he was driven back,
via Denman and Goulburn River. The night he
arrived he was turned into a well-grassed, securely-
fenced paddock near the house. The next morn-
ing he. was gone, and, after some time, was found
in a paddock three miles away. This paddock
was his old run. This horse could jump some, but
to get to his old run he had to climb over three
fences. The only inference is that he remembered
where his old beat lay, and, knowing he was handy
to it, decided to get back to it.

“ J. Skimp ” takes some riding and other
exercise:—
The 2300 miles of German wire-netting that has been
stretched across Westralia at a cost of about half a
million, and is called a rabbit-proof fence, though there
are rabbits on both sides of it, has produced the loneliest
boundary-riding job on record. The. outer-barrier fence
stretches from Starvation Harbor, in the south, to
Broome, in the north, and is divided into boundary-
riding sections of from 40 to 60 miles. The first four or
five sections from the South Coast are done on horses ;
then bike sections run to within 30 miles of Barrambie,
on the Murchison ; and from there north only camels are
used. On the horse or bike sections the men sometimes
have a chance of a “pitch”; but the camel man, who
takes a fortnight to do his beat, sometimes goes for five
or six months without meeting another white pfeller.
hast autumn I travelled along about 1000 miles
of the fence, mostly in the camel country; and
I met some remarkable hatters. In the extreme
North, where there are two men in each camp to prevent
the niggers raiding the tucker, the fence hands are of the
same type as scores of other bushmen and prospectors
scattered through the great tract of scantily-peopled
country in the nor’-west—men who take a lively interest
in Australian affairs, even though their news does arrive
a few months late. I met the first of the hatters south
of the Lake Nabberoo country, and camped with him for
the night. He was a magnificent listener ; his end of the
argument consisted of “ Yes. Goon!" Next morning,
when I went to go on, he altered his argument to
“ What’s-yer-hurry ? ” He was typical of the crowd.
Day after day mobs of emus fled in front of me. They
absolutely refused to turn off, and every day four or five
dropped-from thirst and exhaustion. A boundary rider
asked me to kill any that fell, and drag them away from
the fence before the sun made the job less pleasant for
him to do. I tried to oblige him with the first one, but I
had no luck. The beast had found the punch that Bill
Squires lost, and as a dying.gift presented it to me. I
had not enough time to go through the same performance
four or five times a day. So I left the rest for the
boundary rider.
Every five miles there is a trap, with a wing running
out at an acute angle. Into this corner more or less of
the mob of great floundering birds would rush, breaking .
through the fence, and sometimes nearly levelling the
wing to the ground. A great cloud of feathers arose from
the chaos. So the emu keeps the boundary rider busy at
repairs, and is therefore being exterminated wholesale
with cyanide. T saw scores of carcases and smelt hun-
dreds —a good judge of smells might say thousands.
After passing the silent camel-men, I met a “rider” of .
the other sort. He talked well into the night; and when,
tired after a severe day’s plugging, and feeling very com-
fortable in the warm sand, I would fall asleep, be was
that talk-hungry he would wake me up and curse
my sleepiness. Next day I had to have a violent row
with him to get away at all.
The rest were as hungry to hear another fellow talk as
this one had been to hear himself ; and a man hadliterally
to tear himself away from some of them, there was such
pleading in their, “Oh ! camp a bit! What’s your
hurry?” It was that way all along until I struck the
Magnet-Black Range track, and turned off into com-
parative civilisation.

“S.S.S.” :• In the Torres Strait Islands
the spearing of a first dugong is the raison d’
litre of a mighty kai-kai (feast) and much rejoicing.
All the spearer’s women-kin are bidden ; but none
of his men-folk. The latter stay away because
they are supposed to be grateful to the dugong for
permitting Ambon or Mooka, as his name may be,
to slay it, thereby conferring upon him the patent
of hunter-hood, and making a man of him. Being
grateful to the animal, it wouldn’t be decent pf
them to help in the eating. So the men-folk repair
in splendid solitude to the back of the island, and
fast. North Queensland dugong, or sea-cow, is,
say some, the mythical mermaid of once-upon-a-
time. It is a strange-looking fish-animal, with a
head something like the one a hippopotamus
wears. It has piggish eyes, protected by bristles.
About its nostrils are thick, short hairs, like
brushes, with which it tears up the
sea-grass. On the upper jaw are
two ivory tusks. In the male
they are about 6in. long ; in the
female they are smaller. On
either side, near the neck, are
two short flappers. Thence
the body tapers off to a
torpedo-like tail, with which
Dugong propels himself at a
surprising pace. Full-grown
fish are some 10ft. long, and
weigh half £ ton. They
travel the strait and coral
seas in schools of 12 or there-
about. Every three minutes
they rise to the surface to
breathe. This breathing pro-
duces a strange soughing
sound, caused by the disten-
sion of the snout and then
the sudden closing of an air
val ve. Europeans catch them
in nets; the natives spear
them as they rise to blow.
Dugong oil is much prized as a
rub-medicine in rheumatism,
and . mixed with an equal
quantity of crude turpentine
it is considered something
special for the curing of divers’
paralysis. Doctors give it
internally for wasting diseases
such as consumption. The meat
tastes rather like beef, and is
highly nutritious. Dugong hide
makes splendid shoes. And, lastly, the Japanese
who man the pearling fleets spend half their
spare time in carving cigarette-holders and rings
from the dugong’s beautifully-grained ivory tusks,
and the other half in taking charts of boat pas-
sages in the reefs for future reference.

“Spring” butts into the drowning snake
controversy:—
During the recent sudden floods in the Hunter River
(N.S.W.) an ancient resident of the Maitland district
stalked a hen which was warming up some eggs. He
had nearly fascinated the eackler off the eggs when the
flood struck both him and the box containing the nest.
Struggling gallantly, the snake succeeded in clambering
aboard the box and coiling up in the nest.' With his head
hanging over the edge ,of the box he beheld his wife and
family drowning before his eyes (what became of the ben
is a mystery), and himself drifting into the centre of the
stream. He was buffeted and swept along 1 towards the
sea, but he still hoped .that something might' turn up.
Once he was nearly wrecked on the carcase of a cow. He
was frequently almost beached, and gleefully gathered
himself up to spring for the shore, butevery time something
spoiled his chance. Gradually the waters got steadier but
wider ; he was.coming to the river mouth and to the sea.
Certain cormorants were fishing for catfish just inside
the breakwater at the entrance to Port Hunter. They
had been fishing for about an hour with not much luck,
and had become.hungry, fierce and argumentative. Cat-
fish are hard gentlemen to depend upon for a living, and
are armed with a poisonous dagger at the butt of the
neck. Only' expert cormorants possess the knack of
swallowing them with safety. The largest and most
expert fowl took a long dive. If he didn’t catch anything
he was going to knock off and go home and whack his
wife. He chased a big catfish; but after exhausting
himself in the pursuit he had to give up. He rushed
back to the surface so quickly that he bumped against
the box in which the snake was floating, accompanied by
the eggs. The snake was spilled out in the water. The
cormorant thought this was the biggest cat-fish he’d ever
seen, and he grabbed the' monster near the back of the
neck. For a little while the snake was too dazed to do
much, but when he came back to earth, so to speak, the
fishing ground became a boiling cauldron of hisses and
curses. The other cormorants dashed into the maelstrom.
The original bird exerted his great strength artd lifted
himself and the snake out of the water. This gave the
reptile an opportunity. He lashed out with his tail and
stunned cormorants right and left. Then he started to
strangle his own cormorant. The cormorant had never
been strangled by a catfish before. The pair fell
into the water amidst tremendous applause from the
other cormorants. They disappeared below. About five
minutes afterwards a nearly dead cormorant kicked on
the surface, and received the congratulatory pecks of his
mates. The snake crawled ashore, spitting feathers and
seaweed. A drunken Norse sailor took him for a fantod,
and dropped 1401 b. of rock on him, and that finished him.
Then the sailor died of alcoholic poisoning. Thecormorant
was killed by liis mates. The hen is still missing. The
eggs died young. It was a tragedy.

is 13 miles. These nags are grass-fed, and gallop
all the way. I saw one lot do 13 miles in three-
quarters of an hour.
THE FAITHLESS FANTODS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill Barcoo was a station ’and—’e was a station ’and,
And grafted all the year like Pharaoh’s Jews.
But all'is pay, 1 grieve ter say; ’e blewed—you under-

This station ’and
Was drinky in his views ;
■An-’ ’e was wont ter lash it up on booze.
Fer Bill ’e wandered once a year—exactly once a year—
Ter bust his cheque at Casey’s Bush ’Otel ;
An’ drank the stuff—more than enough—that Casey sed

An’ it wus queer :
When ’e wus on a spell
’E used to ’old'’is sides an’ larf like ’ell.
No doubt yer’ve ’eard of Casey’s beer —of Casey’s fightin’
beer, ; ~
An’ Casey’s Three Star Blue Gum Brandy too,
The stuff .that makes the crimson snakes when you get on
yer ear.
Such visions queer
Were known ter quite a few ;
That’s why they called the shanty “ Casey’s Zoo.”

An’ sich weird sights disturbed the nights of such poor
bushman bloke
; As ’ad a soak
In Casey's famous blend—
In Casey’s fierce an’famous Bushman’s Friend.
But, once a year, Bill struck the spot—’e blithely struck
the spot,
.An’ slung across the bar ’is ’ard-earned cheque ;
Then started in to bust ’is tin an’ make things fairly ’ot
Until’e got

An’ then Bill looked a proper sort er wreck.

An’ one is blue,
An’ t’other’s sort er green.

But t’other, Jim,

One time, when Bill was on the spree—a real ole rorty

■ ’E larfed the ’ole blame time till ’e wus thro.’
We wonders wot noo sort ’e’d got, ’e wus so full er glee.
“ You oughter she 1”

“ Why, blowed if my ole Jim ain’t courtin’ Sue ! ”
Bill ’ad but one spree after that—just one more after that.
An’ sich another sight I’d grieve ter see,

THE VETERINARY SUPPLY STORE,
“ Ben Sun ” : Mallee shoots' exude honey
in early summer, especially after a rainy spring.
Where the roots have been submerged for some
weeks I have seen shoots pouring out honey so
freely that the ground forisome distance around
them was coated with it. It had a rather pleasant
flavor, and provided a good time for ants; but
bees didn’t patronise it. Such profusion, how-
ever, only occurs after the roots have been under
water, and that amount of dampness doesn’t often
happen to the Mallee. Most years active, velvety-
looking flies and the usual ant are hungry and
healthy enough to get away with the toothsome
stuff before it gets thick enough to bog bullocks,
“Wang” libels an old arid respected
Geelong clock : .
In Geelong an ancient clock perches like a fat owl on
the top of a brick tower something like a stout chimney
stack.
The timepiece has been perching there for over 50
years, and it is about the slowest and most bogged thing
to be found in that town. It is generally doddering in
the rear of the time ball, and its efforts to strike the
hours are painful to listen to. There is ample time be-
tween each stroke to enable the old clock to regain its
breath and gather sufficient energy to deal another blow.
The effect on a stranger toiling in the vicinity when he
hears it for the first time strike 12 is remarkable. At
the first boom the toiler drops his tools, and reaches
for his tucker bag. Then comes another boom from
the clock. The grafter sits up straight, arid asks himself
what the Devil’s up. Surely to Heaven it’s not two
o’clock ! He grabs his tools again, and gets hurriedly to
..-raft. Then, boom 1 again. Three! ’Stfewth 1 He tells
DROVIN' ON THE MOONIE.
THE COOK (vehemently): “Every time I shouts
'Gee-up! Gee-up !' an the old horse pits a
go on, about two thousand frogs croaks alto-
gether, Whoa-up, wo-wo-up! ’ an’ he stops
dead. If I ’adn’t stuffed two pounds of muck
into his ears I’d ha’ bin there yet!”
himself he must knock off the booze: He can’t afford to
lose his dinner and several hours’ work.
Boom ! ! Holy Moses ! Four ! !
He Bucks in frantically, determined to make up some
of his leeway, and tells himself between breaths that he’ll
have to get back to Melbourne, where he can work and
not go to sleep at it.
Boom ! !!
FIVE ! ! !
Gord! Knock off time !
He puts on his coat, throws his uneaten dinner to a
dog, and with a dazed look staris off home, when the
sixth hesitating note sprawls on the shuddering air.
Vague doubts assail his mind and haul at his coat-tails so
that he stands irresolute. Then, slowly and heavily, the
other half-dozen of noon fall out of silence, and the truth
is revealed that one o’clock is still Some 60 minutes
ahead. A town like Geelong shouldn’t own anything
more uproarious than a sundial.
BE CAUTIOUS AT ALL TIMES.
OLD HAND: “Hear him cooeyin’ ! The fool's bushed again. Why doesn't he blaze a track
to the camp ?”
NEW, HAND: “ But wouldn't he set the bush on fire this dry weather ?”
“Nomadic,” from Alice Springs: “Alec
Zander” : tays “the man who said that horses
will dig a soakage for themselves lias vine-leaves
in bis hair.”. Well, I haven’t, got vinedeaves in
my hair, and I say that horses will dig soakages
for themselves. In fact, I owned a horse that
Would do it. Also, you don’t need to show him
where to dig; he knows as well as the best man
oh the roads. Brumbies must do it to subsist
When surface waters dry up. Donkeys on the
Finke, : in Central Australia, will dig until their
; bodies -are -wholly beneath the surface. “Alec”
evidently doesn’t know much about the bush-
horse, and from his remarks I’m inclined to think
he knOws less about soakages.
“ Edyson ”: Furthermore, Concerning the
force of habit in cookies’' horses. It was Berry
drove me from Crowbar to Cook s
Siding on two occasions, and I
noticed that the old bay horse
stopped both times at two par-
ticular spotb on the track. On
the second trip I questioned
Berry. “What does the horse
stojo here for)” T asked. Berry dis-
played no feeling m the matter,
but replied, “ Well, yeh see,
mister, this is,where Carter’s-pub
used to be.” I was enlightened.
“ How-long is it since the pub
waS removed?” I asked. Berry
reckoned it was a matter of four
years. At the second Stop I in-
vestigated further, and Berry
pointed to a humpy through the
trees. “Feller in there used t’
do’ a bit 0’ sly-grog ; seHing,” he
said. “ But I can’t convince ole
Hector he’s dead.” Hector was
the horse. From this point on-
ward Hector betrayed great im-
patience under control. Again
I appealed for enlightenment.
“Fact is,” Berry explained, “I was’ gen’ally
asleep in the straw by this, ’n’ ole Hector’s got
accustomed t’ grazin’ his own way home.” A
remembeisome horse was Hector.
A letter from “Albatross,” the mariner
I dropped in at Esperance Bay (W. A.) t’other day for
the first time in 10 years, and on going ashore got a
shock. It was like walking through a graveyard. The
town'Was dead-very dead. • As no humans were visible, I
concluded that the community had thrust its collective
cat into the backyard, slammed and bolted the back door
of the town and turned in for an indefinite' period. The
roads, well looked after in the days of “ the council,” are
now,overgrown with grass and weed, and form the prin-
cipal, pasturage.- Although the adult population cannot
exceed '4O or 50, three pubs eke out a precarious liveli-
hood ; but, sad to say, om bung is forced to supplement
hhs income per_medium of a horse and dray. The brewery,
once a thriving factory, has been demolished; bpt two
stores still remain. The most : conspicuous thing in
Esperance is the Word “Theatre” written on the roof of
an edifice in letters a fathom long ; but I fear me it
will be a long time ere J. C. Williamson eventuates here.
The fire brigade station and fire engine are dropping into
• a sordid state of disrepair, and the dense undergrowth of
silence makes one itch, to climb the tower and ring the
bell like h—l. Esperance is dead all right; yet a few of
the oldest inhabitants still hang on, believing implicitly
in its ultimate resurrection.
Esperance Bay is a fine sheet of water. It has two
jetties capable of berthing vessels up to,24ft. draught.
Nevertheless, it is dead. On the other hand, the Phillips
River is very much alive. The principal gold and copper
fields (smelter included)are in the hands of Germans, who
are pushing things along with Teutonic energy. If the
plane continues as it is going, the people will need to.look
around fora port. The present “port,” Mary Ann
Haven ,or Hopetoun, is open to all weathers, the only
breakwater, being a few straggling reefs, forming a half-
moon, a quarter of a mile from the jetty. There is miser-
able accommodation at the jetty for dug-outs of Bft. or
9ft. draught, and there is no hope of dredging, for the
bottom is solid rock covered with a thin layer of sand.
In the offing (if you know where that is) there is 16ft. of
water, and hardly room to swing a cat, let alone a ship.
Some people favor Doubtful Island Bay, 40 miles west of
Hopetoun, as a deep-water port. It is good; but what
about Esperance, with its two already-built deep-water
jetties? I must shut up now, or it will be thought that I
am barracking for the Esperance-Norseman line, which,is a
tabooed subject. Poor old Esperance !

A BUSH TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
the sun hung over Emu Peak
Through banks of dark cloud blurring,
As o’er the plain by Jones’s Creek
A man came swiftly spurring.
A woman stood by Jones’s gate,
Her hands her dark eyes shaded,
She watched the man come urging on
His dusty horse and jaded.
A magpie carolled from a limb
Of latent joys denied her, ...
What time the sunburned bushman drew
His bridle rein beside her.
He said, “ I’ve come a thousand miles
To keep my pledge unto you ;
I love you, Mary—love you.still.”
She curtly answered : “ Do you?
“ Two years ago you went away,
Of love and such-like .prating.;
The fact is, and I’ll tell you so,
That i got tired of waiting.
“ I’m now no longer Mary Jones,
But Mrs. Mary Ivellow."
“ You mean to tell me that,” says he
" Wot, that there one-eyed fellow ?
“O show me where’s the nearest pub
That I may drown my sorrow. . .
I’ll pick the cattle up again
The day after to-morrow.”
Then from the fence his bridle rein
With sunburnt hands he lifted,
And turned his horse towards the plain
And out across it drifted.
The sun went down o’er Emu Peak,
With banks of dark cloud blurring;
As far away from Jones's Creek
A man went swiftly spurring.

Socialism is being “tried practically” every day—in

JOHN BULL AND JOHN CHINA.
The reception by King Edward, of Chinese Commis-
sioners sent to England by the Chinese Government for
the purpose of studying the organisation of the British
Navy, is one of the most convincing proofs yet given that
China is indeed waking up. In due course, no doubt,
Chinese naval cadets will be enrolled and taught their
duties on English ships just as Japanese naval cadets
were taught three or four decades ag0.... British tradi-
tions of naval leadership, and British methods of seaman-
ship and gunnery are all being used to develop the
strength of two nations which possess conjointly one-
fourth of the population of the entire inhabited globt.—

It used to be said that the first news of
the illness of King Leopold of Belgium would be
the sign for some hurried repairs and enlarge-
ments in Hell, and the wholly disrespected old
person did take ill last week. He was so bad with
a feeling as if someone had built a fire on his
stomach that the sacraments of the Church were
adininistered, after which he was supposed to
be forgiven and at peace with all mankind. While
he was in l this beautiful condition his two eldest
daughters, both of whom he had thrown out,
begged to see him; but he was as venomous as
ever, and refused to let them gaze on the dreary
mullock of his countenance. At latest advices,
the despised old party is dead.
The deceased King of the Belgians lived
74 years and reigned 44. The chief things
oi which he was accused during his reign
were murder with tortuie, murder without
torture, plain torture, robbery with violence, rob-
bery without violence, forgery, embezzlement,
larceny as a trustee, making away with national
property, tyranny, extortion, lying, keeping
gambling-houses and brothels for profit, gross
immorality and associating with unmentionable
characters. For many years the British royal
family and most of the other royal families of
Europe didn’t see Leopold when they met him in
the street; nevertheless, 12 days’mourning has
been ordered at the British Court because the
royal brother is no more.

There is now only one State pensioner in
S. Aus. That is ex-Judge Boucaut, who draws
£l3OO a year. The State saves an equal amount
owing to the death of ex-Judge Bundey, who had
drawn the pension for just six years. None of
the present S. A. Judges except Chief Justice
Way is entitled to any retiring allowance.
Coneybeer, M.L.A., who was Whip to the
Price Government and then for a while was Edu-
cation Minister, is likely to be the Labor nominee
for the Federal seat, empty through James Hut-
chison’s death. Coneybeer, who sings comic
Songs but has no other flagrant vice, is a capital
organiser, and was named as Premier in succession
to Price; but Peake declined to continue the
coalition, so Ooneybeer’s Premiership was off.

Mrs. Eliza Sophia Hungerford, wife of Rev. Septimus
Hungerford, who died at Mosman (Sydney) on Sunday
week, aged 83, was a daughter of Henry Incledon Pilcher,
an old-time solicitor, who was in practice in Maitland in
the early ’thirties, and perhaps even before that. The
Rev. Septimus, 'who is 84 years of age, is the son of
Emmanuel Hun'gerford, of Farley, near West Maitland,
who was a lieutenant in the 32nd Foot, and afterwards a
captain in the South Cork Militia. Emmanuel emigrated
to Sydney in 1828. Rev. Sep. has drawn £lOO a year as
“State aid to religion ” since 1853—50 long years.
A considerable fuss is being made about
an “impudent impostor” who has been borrow-
ing small sums in England on the pretence that
he is a son of Hume Cook, M.H.R. As his
cards set forth that he is from “Melbourne,
South Australia,” he seems to be a very
poor impostor ; but John Bull’s invincible igno-
rance of geography carried him through. Almost
any plausible and well-dressed person from Syd-
ney, Turkey, near Patagonia, can raise a trifle in
England.
Oroson’s ” send-off’ to a patriarch :
The Baptist persuasion in Melbourne loses an old sup-
porter in the humorously-named Cornelius Job Ham,
sometime city councillor, alderman and Rich Landlord,
and tiieson of the Rev. John, first pasior of “ Collins-street
Baptist.” He represented Latrobe Ward for 39 years
without advantage and without disaster, and he occupied
a cushion in the Upper House for 22 years without once
reaching a front seat, except as Hon. Minister in Munro’s
temporary Government. It was as a land-auctioneer he
was best known. C. J. and T. Ham once got all the
State’s land-selling business, and these two Hams were
It and All in.land matters. In Leg. Council elections
money talks ; for the Assembly the candidate must do
the chatting—and Ham couldn’t. I remember him
speaking once at Richmond Town Hall for a Tory candi-
date. The pleasant-looking, Father Christmassy old boy
arose, was introduced, and squeaked out a dozen words,
in a high-pitched, penny-in-the-slot voice—and the heart-
less democrats roared. Then the hoys started mimicking
him, and the show was over. Ham had about a dozen
votes for Richmond in those days, hut he killed his man’s
chance for all that. Ham’s brother-in-law, Henry Cooke,
started the Age, and his brother, Jabez (think of being
called Jabez Ham !) was one of its first editors.
The deceased William Des Voeux was a
numerous Governor in his day, but he never rose
to the higher grades of the business. He spent
his days pottering round small dependencies, and
did the Excellency job at the Bahamas, New-
foundland, Hongkong, Trinidad, British Guiana,
Fiji and such places. He was once High Com-
missioner of the Western Pacific, which is a sort
of water police job at best. Also, he never got to
be anything more dazzling than a knight, though
his elder brother was a baronet. The brothers
were descended from an ancient member of the
Irish Parliament.
Speaker Coles (S.A.), who has just put up
what is said to be a world’s record in the chair of
the State Assembly, and who has never missed a
sitting of the House for 20 years, is a native of
Sydney. He was horn in George-street on .Tan.
19, 1842. He received his education at the Blue
Coat School, London, and since then he has been
various things, including police trooper and
auctioneer. During the whole of his long service
in the chair—l 9 years—he has managed to please
all parties in the House, mainly by being a Speaker
who very rarely speaks. All last session he didn’t
make one remark from the floor of the House, and
he only voted about twice in committee.
“ Jimmie Pannikin ” on a fruitful N.S.W.
family and a river that ought to be fruitful but
isn’t.;—
Re “Starfish” and the Officers of kindly Killara, of
the'Outback. Two he mentions—one who has just con-
structed the first motor-boat to skim along the Darling ;
the other the naturalist who, a while ago, went hunting
up weird things in the Islands for the Melbourne Museum.
But he doesn’t mention that third member of the family,
Edward Cairns Officer, the artist, who painted the finest
Outback pictures yet seen in Australia—such as “An
Australian Creek,” “ Winter Evening in the Bush,” “ A
Grey Day in the Bush,” “Wind Swept Plains,” and
‘’Sheep Watch, Moonlight." These and other splendid
sand and saltbush paintings were exhibited in the gallery
of the Royal Society of British Artists in London, and
made a sensation. Their trueness to the spacious life of
Outback must have made many an exile in Fogland long
for the freedom and fresh air of the open spaces. I
cordially agree with “Starfish” as to the awful evil
wrought by the near-sighted policy of letting this mag-
nificent Darling run to waste. Some day, when dreams
come true, the locking and weiring of the river will add
a beautiful and fertile province to Australia. Only those
who have done time Outback understand what a perma-
nently navigable Darling means. Provincialism and the
Congested City Curse have terribly handicapped the
western Cinderella.
Ex-Senator W. G-. Higgs, good Australian,
good Protectionist and good Radical, is out for
the Capricornia (Queensland) seat in the Laborite
interest at next Federal elections. During a
strenuous career he has been successively printer,
editor of Labor papers in two States, Brisbane
alderman, State (Q.) member and Senator—he
topped the Q. Senate poll in 1901 with 29,450
votes. He went down before Reid’s bogus Anti-
Sosh clamor in the 1906 elections, and has since
directed the Queensland Government Intelligence
and Tourist Bureau, which job he has abandoned
to take, on the new campaign. Archer, Capri-
cornia’s present rep., is a Freetectionist, low-wage
Tory. He voted with the Nationalists for a pro-
tective duty on sugar—sugar is an important in-
dustry in Archer’s constituency. Also he voted
for an import duty on cattle, horses and sheep—
Archer is a squatter. On the other hand, he helped
the Foreign-trade crowd to reduce the duties on
wire netting, soap, stearine, fish, confectionery,
apparel and attire, boots, glassware, ironplate and
a hundred other articles which only need adequate
protecting to ensure their manufacture here.
Archer vvas one of a “Liberal” deputation to the
Minister of Customs which thought that sugar-
workers’ wages should be reduced from 30s. a week
and found to 255. a week and found. He claimed,
blandly, that in the “off” season in this industry
225. Gd. was “an extreme rate of wages.” Cupri-
cornia has a show next election to replace an
unusually undesirable Tory representative with a
sound Nationalist, and if it fails in that plain duty
it should make haste to kick itself severely in
several places for its foolishness.

An Australian — a University Professor
tells The Bulletin how he found a feather float-
ing in the cap of Commonwealth Statistician
Knibbs in far-off Switzerland :
When I had recently occasion to see the director of the
Ecole de Commerce at Neuchatel —a charming man—he
told me at once that the best report in respect to pri-
mary, secondary and University education had been com-
piled by a very learned man, a Mr. G. H. Knibbs, for the
Government of New South Wales. Said the director :“ I
have it always on my table” ; and there it was, with the
marks of daily use thick upon it.
By the Oldest Inhabitant :
A daughter of the late Alexander Oliver, president of
the N.S.W. Land Appeal Court, was lately married at St.
Peter’s Church, Cranley Gardens, Loudon, to the Rev. H.
Norman Burgess, vicar of St. Anne’s, Sheffield. His
Gaiters of Colchester, cousin of the bride, performed the
ceremony. The late Mr. Alexander Oliver was a
native, born in 1833, his father, Andrew Oliver, being a
clerk in the Waterloo Warehouse, and his mother a
milliner and dressmaker at 21 Castlereagh-street, where
Alexander happened. A couple of years afterwards
Andrew Oliver and wife joined T. W. Smart in a drapery
business in Pitt-street, and when Andrew Oliver died Mr.
Smart married the widow. Smart became wealthy,
was in Parliament for a time, and was Treasurer in two
of the Cowper Ministries. There were five Cowper
Ministries.
William Camphin, ex-superintendent of
detectives, who died at Paddington (Sydney) on
Sunday, aged 73 years, saw a good deal of active
service in his young days. He was with Senior-
Sergeant Stephenson when Lowry, the bushranger,
was shot, at the Limerick Paces public-house, and
read prayers, at the dying man’s request, on the
road to Gouiburn. With Detective Elliott, he
was instrumental, in the early’seventies, in arrest-
ing Nichols and Lester for the Parramatta River
murders. At one time, Richard Elliott, William
Camphin and “Paddy” Lyons may be said to
have constituted the detective force of Sydney.
Lyons is the last of the trio living.
It is again hinted in the papers which sup-
port Wade that that person ought to climb shortly
on to the N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench. But
surely a legal individual who has had such bad
luck at law is about the last to whom a
position of the kind should be given. Wade
lias sooled the 'N.JS.W. Government on to
fighting on every possible occasion. There
was hardly a person, however humble, with
whom Gregory wasn’t ready to do battle in
the courts over any small sum of money if there
was a ghost of an excuse for doing battle. And
the results have been very poor. Either Wade’s
knowledge of law is about as bad as it can Vie, or
else he fights cases for the sheer love of fighting
even when Vie hasn’t a case. Either way, the
idea of 0. G. Wade as a Judge seems a screaming
joke.
The Oldest Inhabitant writes an old-
Sydney paragraph without a pub in it: —
Mr. William Long, wine and spirit merchant of old
Sydney, left much valuable city property to his son,
W.A., ex-M.L.C. (now in England), and his three daugh-
ters —Isabella, wife of Chief Justice Martin ; Mrs. W. B.
Dailey, and Mrs. George Oheeke. Mrs. Dailey has been
dead some years ; the Chief Justice’s widow died early in
1909, and Mrs. Oheeke—a widow—resides at Cheltenham,
England. Mrs. Martin’s interests come under the ham-
mer in February. Among the places to be offered are
two ancient houses in George-street, near the Post
Office, originally, it is understood, the property of Mrs.
Reiby, who died in 1855. The houses are very old, but
the iand is about the most valuable in the city. There
are three other shops in George-street, near Hunter-street.
The properties are being sold, so that the money may be
divided amongst the lady’s children, who number 10.
But for his wife, the Chief Justice would have left an
enormous Blue Mountain pile on the lady’s hands.; He
contemplated a mansion at Numantia, and while his wife
was in England he had the foundations laid with money
raised on mortgage from Dan Cooper, but when Mrs,
Martin returned she vetoed the gigantic mansion. And
in this matter the lady was supreme ; for the Chief had
nothing but his salary, and the expense of the building
and its upkeep would have had to come out of William
Long’s property. Martin already had a cottage in the
hills, and Mrs. Martin thought that that was quite good
enough for “Jimmy” and his pals.

Sydney is as pleased with its new Archbishop as a child

Give us a Bishop who will bish
Upon a new and stirring plan ;
’Tis not for sanctity we wish
So much as true, emphatic Man !
Take it from me —Australia loves
The strong, right-sinewed Christ-i-an|
Give us a Bishop-bloke who shoves
His church like some enormous van !
This land is tired of parson-blokes
Who lack all vim and strength and grit;
Saints drifting round like dreary mokes,
Who seek Australia’s thripny-bit!
We yearn for one who plainly spurns
The dreary, old, well-trodden track ;
Who lashes out like Tommy Burns,
And flings the Devil on his back !
A long way up, North Queensland way,
There is the sort of cliap we wish ;
He tramps beside the bullock-dray
Where curses rage and whip-thongs swish
And all the lean Australian coves,
Whose dollars rattle in his dish,
Remark in large, admiring droves—
My oath, this cove knows how to bish !
“ He does not whine about our souls,
Nor sadly tell us we are lost;
You’ll find him rigged in bloomin’ moles,
A-holdin’ of his Pentecost;
A blacksmith’s shop will do for him
To publicate his Message in ” ;
That’s how they talk—Long Bill and Jim—
About his ways of fighting Sin !
"He don’t come moochin’ sadly round
A-wailin’ long, despairful hymns ;
He’ll sit upon the bloomin’ ground,
Arid never mention clierubims !
The Bishop-blokes that came our way,
Before his time, were dreary glims
Who’d barely give a chap ‘ Good-day ’—
Not carin’ if yer sinks or swims !
“ A man like him, who knows his job
And slings the time o’ day to us ;
He’ll rake the Lost off Satan’s hob,
And make Old Nick perform and cuss 1
But parson-coves that puts on side,
And wants a bloke to make a fuss ;
Take it from me—us chaps don’t ride
In his pretentious gospel-’bus !
“ This blanky Land,” you’ll hear men say,
Up there where all the world is new,
“ Wants bishop-coves who’ll bish their way
On lines like his, and shove things through.
A bloke who’ll put some meaning in
His few remarks will fetch the crew ;
Although they call us tanks of sin,
I bet he’ll shift us —me an’ you !.”
Give us a Bishop, then, who’ll bish
Upon a new, soul-stirring plan ;
’Taint for the sound of hymns we wish
So’ much as plain, hard-punching Man!
Take it from me—Australia cheers
'J’he strong, athletic Christ-i-an.
Give us a Bishop-bloke ivho fears
To cheat his God —no charlatan
Will do for us. To Him who steers
This world we pray : “ Give us a Man 1 ”

Westralia proposes to borrow harder than ever.
The State leaned on Cohen last year to the extent of
£1,026,405 ; for the current year it proposes to lean on
him to the extent of £1,693,899. The population is about
265,000, so Newton Moore wants to borrow £6 Bs. per
head, man, woman and child. And then he announces
that his watchword is “ Courage and caution”! There
are not many things that Newton Moore won’t borrow
for. For the vague thing described as “ the develop-
ment of agriculture” he has put down £202,283; for
the equally vague “development of the goldfields and
mineral resources” the figure is £96,000. Roads and
bridges, which won’t return a penny, are to be paid for
out of borrowings—provided that Cohen will lend—to the
extent of £33,344 ; and public buildings, which also won’t
return a penny, are to cost £99,881 of Cohen’s money. Of
course, seeing that all these things won’t yield any re-
venue, while for every pound that he lends Cohen will
have to be paid, the increased interest must be met out
of taxation ; and Westralia’s capacity for dodging in-
creased taxation amounts to a disease.

Profits are smaller than they had been for a few previous
terms because the bank has had to pay more for its own
horrowings ; and, though, to counteract that, lending
rates may have firmed a trifle also, the advances have
been reduced in bulk. They were previously no doubt
too big ; they were so big that 12 months ago the bank
actually did not have in liquid securities enough to pay
20 per cent, of its total liabilities. Since then things
have improved, and the proportion of liquid assets is now
about 25 per cent, of liabilities—and even that is cutting
things very fine. Depositors and other creditors are, how-
ever, concerned not only with the proportion of liquid
assets, but also with the proportion of liabilities compared
with shareholders’ funds. From this point of view the
position is very much stronger ; for every £1 of its own
money the bank has less than £3 of the public’s, so that
the shrinkage in the value of the assets would have to
be very severe before the public’s money would be in
danger. Considering how comparatively little public
money the bank has the use of, the earnings are very
good. Calculated on capital and reserves combined, the
profits have lately worked out as follows:
Nov., 1905 ..£6 4 1 p.c. May, 1908 ..£9 2 0 p.c.
Mav, 1906 ..6 2 3,, Nov., 190 S .. 813 3 „

May, 1907 .. 913 5 ~ Nov., 1909 .. 712 2 „
Nov., 1907 .. 8 19 3 ~
As explained above, this recent reduction is no doubt
partly due to the very proper calling in of advances, as
shown (with a few other things) hereunder :
Nov.,’oB. N0v.,’09.

Premises, etc 27,214 27,556 Inc. 342
The progress of the business for many years past could
have been much more rapid without being furious. Ten
years ago the advances totalled £496,100 ; they are now
£627,079, an increase of less than 30 per cent. Current
account deposits have moved only from £237,538 to
£261,587. This may not be so much the bank’s fault as
its misfortune ; it confines its business to the least pro-
gressive of all the States, which is so much prouder of its
sheep than of its men that it crowds the men out to
make room for the sheep ; wherefore banking business
suffers along with the rest, because even a 50-prize sheep
rarely opens an account or wants an overdraft.

Customers of the A.J.S. Bank are getting a
circular from head office, telling them that the new bank
(the Australian Bank of Commerce) will take the shutters
down on January 3, and inviting them to send in the
necessary authority for changing their accounts to the
new concern. The most cheerful intimation, however,
is that “ the new bank will commence business under the
most favorable conditions, being absolutely free from all
the difficulties which for many years past beset the old
bank, and with an increased capital and inscribed deposits
together amounting to nearly £3,000,000 the bank will be
in a position to offer greater facilities to its customers.”
Taking it all round, there isn’t a more profitable class of
business in Australia to-day than banking ; and in view
of that and of the connection the A. B. C. Bank has al-
ready got, and of the severe writing-down of the old
assets, nothing but shockingly bad management or some
shocking Australian misfortune should keep the new
concern from being a big success.

less will make all the difference. For 11 years,
however, this co. has managed to keep on the right
side, though its loss 12 years ago was bigger than
any subsequent single year’s profit has been. But
though it has had this very fair procession of profits,
the co.’s additions to reserves haven’t been as substantial
as they might have been. No doubt the management
could answer that the position is stronger now than it
was 10 or 11 years ago, because the net premiums (and
therefore presumably the risks) are practically the same
now as they were then, while the reserves are about
£20,000 stronger. But if a co. hasn’t been able to increase
its business in the past 10 or 11 years there is obviously
something wrong. Always the Stinking Fish cry with
regard to Australian fire and marine offices is that they
are so small; and the best way to drown that cry is to
heap a big weight of reserves on top of it. But even
without bigger reserves the co. is quite strong enough to
take much more risks than it has been carrying, assuming
that the present risks are of the ordinary character. For
every £1 of premiums it received last year the co. has
over £6 of paid capital and reserves, and that’s more than
twice the average of the leading British companies.
Whether the co. is taking full advantage of the strength
of its position is by no means certain. Its head office is
in Hobart; and Hobart doesn’t seem exactly the place
from which to direct a progressive Australian concern.

The comparison of premiums received is depressing;
they were actually less in 1909 than in 1900. The
expense rate, though recently increased, is still not
very high ; the figures for 1909 do not, by the way, in-
clude the expenses of turning the co. into a limited
liability concern. The weakest feature of the accounts is
the excessive proportion of the funds sunk in mortgages ;
no less than £86,985, or considerably more than two-thirds
of the money, is invested in these securities. Possibly the
directors know or suspect something not too favorable
in connection with some of these securities ; anyhow,
they have transferred £20,000 to a contingency fund. At
present this is included with the reserves, though when a
Board creates a contingency fund it is usually fairly safe
to look for a crack in the floor through which it will pre-
sently fall into a bottomless pit. Still, even if there is
this shrinkage, and if the whole £20,000 were wiped right
out, the co.’s position, so far as insurers are concerned,
would still be much stronger than the average.

This Maoriland public office does a good deal more than
the ordinary trustee co. The trustee co., though it does
excellent work as a rule by managing your affairs for
you after you are too dead to manage them for yourself,
won’t guarantee any return upon your investments. It
won’t even guarantee that your investments will not go
broke and be worth less than nothing in the £. This
public office will. If a testator leaves the investments to
the discretion of the office, the office (which means the
State) will guarantee that the beneficiaries will get 20s.
in the £of the principal. The return it doesn’t guaran-
tee : the interest payable on these investments is only
fixed from time to time, and not for very far ahead. If
the investments chosen and guaranteed by the
office yield a trifle more than the amount thus
fixed and guaranteed temporarily, the office takes the
surplus, and passes it to its own reserves ; for the time
may come when its guarantees will cost it a lot of money.
The next step will be to guarantee interest. At present
a Maorilander making a will Can say—“ Now I know that,
unless the State blows out, I can be sure that every penny
I leave for my widow and children will reach them, less
very moderate charges.” But at present he can’t say—
“ I’ve got £lO,OOO, so if I die my family' will have at least
£350 a year from interest.” The trouble is thatSSjn office,
not knowing what the earning power of mone/will be 30
years ahead, would have to assume a ' very low
interest rate, just as a prudent insurance office does ;
and probably the trustee office of the future will do that,
and undertake to distribute any surplus interest earnings
in the shape of bonuses, just as insurance offices also do.
That, however, has yet to come.
To get back to the Maoriland Trust Office. The
revenue, as mentioned above, is derived partly from
surpluses on investments ; the other part comes from
ordinary commissions and tf-ifles. Of the total revenue
of £36,804 last year, £17,323 came from surpjiis interest.
In the past two years, it will be noticed, large
have been written off. These are sums spent on new office
buildings ; and there is no obvious reason why they should
have been wiped out. They are apparently good assets
which don’t merely replace other assets that have been
destroyed. Costs of managing the private estates cannot
be taken out, because the Department manages also a
host of other funds and estates. Such estates as are con-
trolled in N. S. Wales by the Master in Lunacy are, for
instance, managed in Maoriland by this expert office ;
also the Police Provident Fund, the Coal-miners Relief.
Fund, the native reserves of land, the State’s wretched
little sinking funds, and many others. The business so
far as it relates to private trusts is steadily increasing. In
1903 there were 744 estates in hand, valued at £1,279,743 ;
this year there are 1533 valued at £2,504,614 ; and these
are exclusive of intestate estates, which pass automatic-
ally into the control of the office.

The co. is going ahead fast, although even front the
beginning—it was hatched in 1892—it had more to do
than most young trustee cos. The average trustee co.
has to sit down as patiently as it can and wait for its cus-
tomers to die ; and until they do die it hasn’t very much
work. In this matter even a trustee co.’s best customers
are most inconsiderate; they won’t hurry up. But the
Westralian co. evidently had a good deal of agency busi-
ness to do for absentees, Westralia being a place where
that curse thrives luxuriantly. Now, however, after 17
years, the co. is getting much more trustee business;
so the total credit balances of the estates, etc., in hand
have increased thirteen-fold in 8£ years. This and other
details are set out below :

The co.’s dividends have all this century averaged 15 per
cent. In view of the very rapid growth'/tdihe risks—for,
roughly, the risks increase in proportion to tlie trust in-
vestments—it would have been better had the dividend
been kept at 10 per cent. It is quite clear that this co.
doesn’t take the same serious view of its liabilities as
some trustee cos. on the eastern side ; the difference pro-
bably is that they have been through a bad slump in
property values, and therefore know, while that experi-
ence has yet to happen to this co. For that’s
when the trouble is apt to hit a trustee co.
—when beneficiaries doffit get what they ex-
pected to get, and consequently set some hungry lawyer
looking round for a pin with which to fasten the respon-
sibility on to the trustee co. And as many wills and
similar documents on which the co. has to act are vague,
and may in some place or other almost as easily mean one
thing as another, the pin can very often be found. It is
pretty certain that this co. will strike that trouble sooner
or later; wherefore it ought to resist the temptation to
keep its dividend beyond 10 per cent.—anywaj*, until the
reserves are much stronger. The capital is only £lO,OOO ;
and the whole of that and £2OOO besides is sunk in pre-
mises. The balance of the funds is mainly out on mort-
gage. The co. has no liabilities—not of the sort, anyway,
that can be shown on a balance-sheet.

In 1893 this society had a “ permanent ” paid capital of
£137,790 ; and it owed—shareholders, £14,318 ; deben-
ture-holders (mostly named McTavish, of Glasgow),
£72,850 ; depositors, £28,991 ; and the bank (apart from
a mortgage on the office premises), £55,277. All this
money had been put into boom advances ; naturally, there-
fore, there was trouble, and, as the table on top of this
suggests, the trouble hasn’t been completely got rid of.
There isn’t, however, a great deal left of the old debt.
The debentures are down to £24,455 ; the depositors have
been paid; so is the bank ; even the mortgage on the
premises has been reduced by more than half. McTavish,
previously mentioned, didn’t take things altogether
kindly, so the court had to be appealed to some years
ago in order to fix up a scheme of repay-
ment. The arrangement then made was that no
dividend should be declared until all the debentures had
been paid off; and that accounts for the absence of a
dividend column in the foregoing list. The last of the
debentures are payable in 1911; and by that time, unless
something serious and unexpected happens, it should be
easy to arrange matters. It is true that the society
hasn’t been accumulating the cash necessary to pay off
the last McTavish; though large sales of property
have been made, no doubt most of them have been
on time-payment, and what cash has come in has
been lent out again. Still, so far as one can judge by
published figures, the position has improved very
much. The properties, etc., were so severely written
down a few years ago that the sales have brought in more
than the written-down values; and from that it looks as
if the present capital and reserves were worth all of 20s.
in the £. Now, capital and reserves total £61,464, while
the total debt (including debentures) is only £44,673. As
mentioned above, it shouldn’t therefore be a hard matter
to exchange the debentures presently for some other sort
of debt; and then the shareholders, after a very long
wait, will begin to have a look-in. The progress since
the writing-down in 1903 is further shown hereunder

The small amount in vacant land is a good'feature. The
office freehold hasn’t been written down further lately,
but as it is bringing in 4£ per cent, it probably isn’t at
all overvalued. The capital (“permanent”) is now
£48,486 in £1 Shares. It used to be represented by £5
shares ; but, after many shares had been forfeited, two of
£1 were issued at the last cleaning-up for every one of
the old denomination. Far too much of the capital is re-
presented by the office freehold, and far too little by
advances ; and while this lasts anything in the way of
hjg returns is oufeof the question. Still the society can
reasonably look forward to moderate dividends on the
severely written-down capital before long.

The year’s profit is made up this way From ordinary
business, £57,368; profit on sale of assets (credited to
contingency fund), £8,299. The reserves, with the addi-
tions made to them during the past year, are as follows:

£114,188
The £9360 shown as written off is made up like this :
Shares in other cos. written down, £2922 ; depreciation
on mills, £5931 ; ditto, rolling-stock, £507. The item
“ Depreciation on mills, £5931,” is taken from the profit
and loss account; apparently, however, judging by the
balance-sheet, it includes the depreciation of standing
timber, on account of the hole made in the supplies
during the year. For many years nothing was written
off on that account at all ; then (to comply with
the Victorian Companies Act, it was said) something
was written off annually. In 1907-8, however, the
timber assets were re-valued, and it was then
declared that, mainly owing to the increase in the
value of kauri, what was left was worth practically
just as much as the whole lot had been at the beginning.
In 1907 the timber reserves, etc., were valued at £382,510;
after being drawn upon for 12 months they were then
re-valued at £547,112. Other purchases have since been
made, and the item now stands at £625,272, less £3207
depreciation for the year. The capital is £585,000. Half
of this is in shares fully paid to 335. ; the other half is in
450,000 shares paid to 15s. For many years the co. did
very poorly, and in 1898 7s. per share was written off
all round. Up to that time, and for some years later,
the co. carried a heavy burden of debentures. With the
improvement of trade in Australia this co.’s position also
improved; but the extent of the improvement wasn’t
visible until a couple of years ago. In fact, the real
strength of the position wasn’t hinted at until the re-
valuation of assets was made in 1907-8. Up to that time
the management had allowed the public and shareholders
to assume that the timber reserves, etc., were worth con-
siderably under £400,000, whereas (if the valuation is
sound) they actually were worth about £600,000. Pretty
well everything depends, no doubt, upon that valuation ;
and there is no means of checking it. Apart from timber
lands, timber and mills, the co has £77,279 net of assets.
This shows the movement with regard to liabilities and
liquid assets (including book debts): —

The surplus of more or less liquid assets has thus been
drawn upon to the extent of £49,010 during the past year.
Apparently this money, and a good deal besides, has gone
into new vessels, plant, or purchases of standing timber;
for the composite item which includes these and other
things has sprung during the year to the extent of
£74,953. The liabilities do not nowadays include any
debentures; the chief item is the co.’s liability to con-
tractors for logs.

This co. has had numerous changes. It was formed in
1889 to takeover the business of E. Rich and Co.— princi-
pally a N.S. W. back-country business. In 1898 an Eng-
lish co. took over the concern from the Australian co. The
new co. was in 162,207 shares of £1 each, fully-paid ; the
purchase price was £lOO,OOO, of which £70,000 was in
shares. The business of the Queensland Mercantile Co.
was next incorporated, and the paid capital went up to
£198,037 in £1 shares. From the beginning Dalgety and
Co., Ltd., was understood to have more or less control of
the English co. ; and the registered office was in Dalgety’s
London premises. For a few years it also looked as though
it would stay there ; the drought almost flattened the
co. out in 1902-3, and in those years and in 1904 no
dividend was paid. Then things improved rapidly ; and
as they improved J. Bull let his shares go, and Australia
picked them up. During the past year the majority got
on this side ; and then the head office was shifted from
London to Sydney, though the registered office remains
at Bishopsgate St. Within, which is some distance from
Bourke and Brewarrina —too far to walk, anyway. Still
that doesn’t matter so much nowadays, because the Bourke
and Brewarrina branches have lately been sold. And that
suggests that the nature of the business has changed to
some extent. In the beginning the Bourke district and the
country out that way was the co.’s stronghold ; and very
distressful country it has become. But the co. covers a
wider field now, and it has some valuable city agencies as
well. Future droughts may not therefore knock it quite
as flat as past droughts have done.
Three points in the published accounts call for
attention. First, the reserves are very small for a co.
which has been in existence 11 years. Yet the position
in that respect is better than it looks. Accounts beyond
1904 are not available; but in that year there
was a goodwill item of £lO,OOO, and that has
now been wiped out entirely. In that year there
were also book debts of £70,746 ; and the chances are
that that lot took some writing down. The co. has there-
fore done more than merely accumulate £4577 in 11 years.
The second point that sticks out is—“ Sundry debtors,
£68,531.” This is exclusive of bills, £23,168. There are,
of course, risks in that item ; much depends on the
earnestness with which provision is made for doubtful
entries. Then, finally, stock stands at £104,875 ; and
much the same has to be said about that. On
top of these things, and in view of the small reserves,
it is not pleasant to note that the amount divided
this year is greatly in excess of the year’s
disclosed profits. There may be some good excuse for
doing this. Thus very heavy writing-down of old
accounts may have been done; but there is no sign of
that in the published sheets. The co.’s own liabilities
now amount to £35,110 ; and considering the size of the
business, that may be regarded as a very modest total,
and not likely to cause serious trouble even if things
don’t go quite as well as the recent increased energy of
the co. deserves that they should.

Charters Towers is having one of its dull times, so it
doesn’t stay up late at nights counting up its dividends.
In fact, for November, there was for the whole field only
one small dividend to count up. This co. went on paying
10 per cent, muchTtoo long; and when the old
rate was too much even for a Charters Towers Board
to recommend, it couldn't bring itself to mention a
smaller one, but threw the responsibility on the share-
holders ; and the same thing happened again in the past
half-year. It will be noticed that nothing has latterly
been written off to cover depreciation : all that is being
done is to keep the thing patched up. And that gener-
ally means trouble in the end. Since a goldfields’ end
often comes much earlier than it is expected, and in view
of this co.’s lack of cash reserves, the whole of the divs.
paid or to be paid by' this co. can’t be regarded as divi-
dends : some of them must be regarded merely as return
of capital. Before the div. was paid the liquid assets (ex-
clusive of stocks) totalled £l9ll ; and the liabilities were
£312, leaving a surplus of £1599. The paid capital is
£20,000.

There was a scatter in the Perth City Council
at the recent elections, and the ex-Mayor, who had been
pushing on the preliminaries for taking over the Gas
Co.’s business, was bumped out. As the new Mayor
(R. P. Vincent) favors the National Ass., some people
reckoned that the co. wouldn’t be disturbed for a while.
But the new man says he is just as much in favor of
taking over the business as the old one was. Anti-Sosh
is all very well in theory ; but when it comes to practice
it’s an animal of a different complexion.
It takes a long time for some Boards to find that
they have been getting too much money. Ever since
1852 the English, Scottish and Australian Bank directors
in London have been drawing in all £3OOO a year free of
income-tax. On an average the tax probably meant £2OO
a year. Now, however, it is discovered, after 57 years,
that there wasn’t any express authority for the-directors
to pay the income-tax out of the till; so a new article has
been passed giving that authority, and a special resolu-
tion has been passed ratifying and confirming all the pay-
ments that have been made ever since the beginning of
things.

The prospectus of the Stockowners’ Meat Co.
of Central and Northern Queensland, Ltd., has been sent
out, apparently as a sort of feeler. The idea is to issue
10,000 shares of £25 each for the purpose of carrying out
a resolution adopted at stockowners’ meetings held in
Melbourne, Longreach and Sydney'. The promoters don t
seem too sure of profits; but they say: “The stock-
owners would only need to get 6d. per head more for their
sale-cattle and ljd. more for their sale-sheep to pay in-
terest on their investment, even though the works did not
pay at all.” In fact, it is proposed to carry the pretty idea
of the Sydney Meat Preserving Works into the North, and
provide a means to keep the market stiff whenever it looks
as though the local public might get cheap meat. The co.
isn’t at all sure it will make any profit out of the ‘ sur-
plus” to be exported; but it will get “the fullest

possible value ” for what it does export, and somethin?
more than it gets now for the meat it supplies to the
Australian consumer. As a neat scheme for up-
setting- the law of supply and demand it beats
“Peter Bowling’s mines” hollow. And yet no-
body mentions conspiracy ; and if anybody sug-
gested that the idea was to strike against the Austra-
lian public, and that the promoters might get 12 months
hard if they lived in N. S. Wales, Senator Simon Fraser,
one of the provisional directors, w-ould probably be quite
annoyed about it. Yet the principle of the two schemes
is just the same: Peter calculated on getting a big
price for coal by limiting the output, and Simon calcu-
lates on getting a bigger price for beef and mutton by
limiting the output of those things—the output, that is,
so far as the Australian market is concerned.

Broken Hill is on the edge of another water-
famine, and trains have been fitted up ready to drag
along a domestic supply from dams down the line.
There is probably a month’s supply left in the bottom of
the Water Co.’s reservoir; but it isn’t exactly water—it
would be hard to say what it is ; by the end of the month
you would have to drink it with a fork. Meantime the
local inhabitant isn’t praying for rain as might be
expected. In fact, if he’s praying at all, it is to the effect
that the tap will be kept turned off for another couple of
months, so that a loud enough howl will go up to drive
the Government to some action. The matter of a supple-
mentary supply has been referred to the Public Works
Committee. One or two mines have a fair quantity of
mine-water ; but most of them are desperately hard up.
The size of the Sulphide Corporation’s business
at the Central Broken Hill mine nowadays can be judged
by the fact that in a recent three weeks —from November
20 to December 12—the despatches of lead and zinc con-
centrates totalled 20,738 tons.

Litigation over the zinc-flotation processes isn’t
finished yet. The owners of the Potter patents—the
Potter Sulphide Ore Treatment, Limited—have during
the past 12 months scored victories over the Mineral
Separation, Limited, in three patent-amendmehtcombats ;
in the last one a judgment was given in their favor by the
Privy Council. Now the co. has hopes that it will score
a fourth victory in the N.S.W. Equity Court against the
Sulphide Corporation. This co., in association with
the Minerals Separation, Limited, has for some years
past been treating large quantities of zinciferous tailings
by a flotation process which is alleged to be a modifica-
tion of Potter’s. The owners of the Elmore patent rights
(The Ore Concentration Co., Ltd.) have also commenced
an action in the N.S.W. Equity Court against the Sul-
phide Corporation for an alleged infringement of their
patents.

In 592 ft. of driving in the bottom level of the
K.vloe (N.S.W.) 1554 tons of ore were broken, averaging
10-94 percent, copper : and this works out at 170 tons of
metal. The north drive, giving 756 tons, averaged 13 - 41
percent.; and the south drive, with 798 tons, averaged
8-61 per cent. The average has varied a good deal from
week to week: yet for only one week was the pro-
duct under 6 per cent. Towards the present ends,
though they are 600 ft. apart, the values have
been only slightly less than the average for the
whole: working ; the last 105 ft. to the north gave 332 tons
averaging 11-53 per cent., and to the south 110 ft. gave
475 tons averaging 7-7 per cent. What will happen at
the next level nobody, of course, knows ; but as at each
level so far (the bottom one is at 400 ft.) the shoot has
been longer,than in the lev-el just above it, there are
bright anticipations for the future. Certainly the shoot
will have to begin to pull in at some level
or other-it can’t very well go on expanding in-
definitely—and though, therefore,, no ore below the
present bottom can be counted in with the proved
reserves, it is reasonable to expect that there is a good
deal of it below 400 ft. For if the shoot is longer at 400 ft.
than anywhere else, it isn’t likely that it will cut out
from 600 ft. to nothing all at once.

It looks as though the Harden (N.S.W.) has
struck a poor patch at the new No. 5 level. The two
ends are now 112 ft. apart, and nothing of any value has
been found in the lode throughout that distance. Fortu-
nately the shaft is deep enough for another level; so a
plat has been put in at 750 ft., and things are being got
ready to go out and see what the reef at that depth is
made of. Meantime, however, the No. 5 workings will be
continued ; for, though better things were expected by
rhis time, nothing rich was looked for until the drives
were further east and west.

Stannum Lode Co., formed in Melbourne during
the tin boom of 1906 to work several old and well-gouged
claims near Deepwater (N.S. W.), hasn’t had much luck.
The paid capital is only £7250, and £5OOO of that (in paid
shares) the vendors took at one bite. Two divs., totalling
£1250, were paid early in 1908 ; but things haven’t gone
so well since then, and in the past six months the profit
and loss debit balance has moved on from £1384 to
£1467. The payable tin-stone is very patchy. Lately a
few bunches have been found ; and as the co. has now
bought a small five-head battery from an even more un-
fortunate neighbor, next half-year’s results ought to be a
trifle brighter. The co. still has about £250 in cash to the
good. '

“ Marloo” : As a result of the coal strike, Lis-
imore district (N.S.W.) found itself paying any old price
tfor fuel; so the residents diverted their attention for a
few minutes from (low, and appointed a committee to
Hook round. The committee soon encountered about a
•dozen very eager farmers from Nimbin, 19 miles from
Lismore, each with a coal-seam to offer. So far the dis-
trict has been getting some of its coal from Bananaland ;
but it finds the Nimbin product far superior to the
northern goods, and very little inferior to the stuff that
comes from Newcastle. Already, therefore, vague whis-
pers about applications for Government aid can be heard
among the Anti-Sosh owners of the Nimbin seams.

Main Ridge Deep Lead (N.S.W.) has opened a
wide area of wash dirt, mostly of a low-grade, cementy
nature, below the basalt. It is an old deep lead that has
been made easily accessible by a prolonged washing away
of the surface. Tunnels and drives have been extended
for hundreds of feet, so it has been necessary to sink an
air shaft, which struck the wash at 75ft. Boulders are
sometimes troublesome, but are easily shifted in blocking
out. The wash averages about 2Jft. thick. The mill has
started running, so if the water supply can be maintained
the co. should soon know what the wash is worth. If it
turns out well, there will be hope for numerous other
cement hills in N.B.W.
The Bull-owned Mount Boppy, near Oobar
(N.S.W.), continues to do things on a big scale. For Sep-
tember the niihe produced 36060 z. and for October •
36100 z. During October 5719 tons were crushed for
lllOoz., or less than 4dwt. per ton ; 3624 tons of tailings
gave 11280 z., 1884 tons of slimes 8420 z., 1076 tons of
residues 2590 z., and concentrates made up a total of
36100 z. from 12,339 tons of various kinds of material.
More by-products are treated than the quantity of
quartz crushed; so if all the gold is credited
to the latter the return is rather deceptive.
There is this to be said for chairman Iloffnung and his
co.: though the reserves in the mine are still pretty good
and the end isn’t visible even in the distance, the co. is
putting back some of the fat divs. into the district, The
South Boppy is being prospected on an expensive scale,
and the co. has started to shake things up under a work-
ing option over a group of small neighboring mines.
Starting with December, Kalgoorlie costs will
show' a slight increase on account of the higher rate
charged for water. The old agreement expired at the
end of September, but by filling every available tank and
boiler, and storing as much of the fluid as possible, the
cos. have managed to stave off the evil day until now.

Holden Links (W.A.) has completed its deal
with the Oroya-Brown Hill and Kalgoorlie Amalgamated.
The co. issues 750,000 additional shares, making 1,250,000
in all; it gives the Oroya-Brown Hill 600,000 shares for
its plant and leases, and the Kalgoorlie Amalgamated
150,000 shares for its big area of country, and keeps
100,000 shares in reserve. The contributed working capi-
tal aggregates £36,200. The arrangement provides the
new co., which is to be known as the Oroya Links, with a
mill capable of 11,000 tons a month, and obviates the
necessity for making' an assessment for plant and develop-
ment of ore reserves. Moreover, it can start earning
profits right away.

Tindalls (W.A.) again passes round the hat.
Twelve months ago dividends were alleged to be racing
towards shareholders with the speed of Halley’s comet,
but, as this paper reckoned at the time, receipts have
fallen far short of legitimate working expenditure, to say
nothing of “ office expenses ” and the big bill run up at
the machinery store. As a result, the shareholders have
been frequently touched for sixpenny calls, and now
another one has been made to “ meet the cost of equip-
ment.” At a shivoo in August last the ore in sight was
officially estimated at 55,000 tons, worth approximately
£2 per ton ; but as somehow the mill only manages to get
a little more than half that sum out of the stone, the
people who. made the estimate must have seen double.
The coming year’s operations are likely to prove an eye-
opener to those w'ho took everything for granted and got
in at fancy prices.

The revenue of North White Feather (W.A.)
for the year ended June last amounted to £38,643; and,
after paying 20s. in the £ and taking into account the
cash brought forward, a surplus of £7123 remained. By
the end of September, this sum ; had been increased to
£9790, and something has been added since then. On
the whole, the pastyear’s developments have been satis-
factory. The ore bodies opened up, although not very
wide, are of fair length, and the grade is decidedly higher
than the average treated during the previous 12 months.
Still, there are no pickings for shareholders at present.

New Brilliant Freehold’s half-yearly meeting
passed off at Charters Towers with congratulations all
round. The half-year’s profit was £SI23, so the dividend
of Is. per share (£7500) is rather a strain on the finances.
Still the mine has only just got to the productive stage.
The directors have borrowed £9OOO to pay for a 9-20th
share in the Burdekin mill, recently purchased by Mills’
United for £20,000. Besides that, £5232 has been spent
on the branch railway and new machinery, so the mine
should be well equipped. The air is blowing through
from No. 8 Mills’ United to the N.B.F. shaft, a distance of
about 1000 ft., and with the new 20-drill compressor at
work the mine is expected to do things next year. But
Towers’ speculators have already heavily discounted
those big things. In 12 months shares have been run up
from 255. to the edge of 40s.

Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, got £9681
from 4974 tons of stone and mill by-products, and made a
profit of £2198 for the month. A run of steady returns
from such a patchy mine indicates up-to-date manage-
ment. All thrown in, the reserves are reckoned at 70,000
tons, or about 14 months’ supply. The manager says that
assay samples give erratic results, so no estimated value
is attached to the reserves. Last half-year’s profit was
£15,845 from 31,500 tons. The plant has been improved,
the mine opened to a depth of 2700 ft., and working costs
at 335. compare favorably with those of any other mine
on the Towers.

From Cloncurry (Q.): “ Cloneurry’s 1909 Christ-
mas won’t produce any wild orgies, as the Australian
mine is idle and most of the others are marking time.
Mount Cuthbert, out on the Leichhardt, is only baling.
The money doled out is barely sufficient to keep the water
down and pay managerial expenses. It would be better
to close the Outhbert altogether and spend what money
is available in developing some of the other leases held by
the co. Powerful pumping and winding machinery is re-
quired, also smelters and a railway ; so shareholders will
have to dip deep into their pockets before they get any
return from the money already spent.
“ Hampden still has a big staff on the surface and
a few miners below. The men have struck rich sulphides
in the bottom level; but how much or how little the find
amounts to has not yet transpired. The railway will be
at Hampden in a couple of months, and the co. will then
have to get a move on or show cause. The old excuses
won’t then wash any longer. The Duchess, which belongs
to the Hampden, is a good mine and well developed ; 150
men could be employed below without overcrowding.
“W. H. Corbould, at Mount Elliott, isbusypull-
ing down and re-erecting the smelters ; for the rest, the
co is ‘ resting.’ The water supply will always be a
source of trouble. Mount Elliott is almost on the divide
of the Gulf and South Australian waters, and as the
creek (Maggie’s) on which the co. depends has only a few
miles of a watershed, the chances of continuous smelting
are remote. Labor troubles are also liable to occur ; even
now the employees are at boiling point.”

Ernest Henry, the owner of Mount Oxide, the
reputed copper marvel of outermost Cloncurry, is
down having a look at Brisbane with some wonderful
specimens in his bag. Henry is now to be reckoned
among. Queensland’s exploring veterans. He was a con-
temporary of Walker and McKinley. One of his first trips
was in 1859, with G. E. Dalrymple, from Brisbane to Rock-
hampton overland, and thence on to the Burdekin. He
went in for squatting for a while afterwards, but gave
that up and took to prospecting, which has been his vice
eversince. His claim to be the discoverer of Cloncurry
is backed by good evidence. For the last four years he
has been developing Mount Oxide, which is about 160
miles north-west of Cloncurry. He says be discovered
the mine years ago, but didn’t work it then on
account of the great expense of carriage to the
coast. Even now it costs £7 per ton to“take ore from
there to Burketown or Normanton. Tapk smelting
charges on to that, and 20 per cent, ore becomes unprofit-
able. And down in Tasmania Mount Lyell gets fat on 2
per cent, stuff. Which suggests that, when copper is
mentioned, the punter needs to know something more
than the mere assay value of the ore.

W. H. Woodhead, managing director of the
British Broken Hill, where an Elmore plant is going up,
is satisfied that that process is what the Einasleigh wants
too ; so the North Queensland show is to have an experi-
mental unit to handle the low-grade ore. The high-grade
stuff—picked out on a travelling belt—will be sent to the
Chillagoe smelters as at present. The output has lately
been 100 tons a day.

Oathcart, at Ararat, has convulsed the Victorian
mining market more than any other property since Glen-
fine South sprang into the firmament, blazed for a while,
and then flickered out. Of course, there have been
Barrambie Ranges and Wheal Ellen—both Westralian
“ floats ” —but they were planets of a different order. It
was only the regular mining men who got the fever over
them, and if those people fell in they did so knowing the
risks. Cathcarts, on the other hand, have got Western Dis-
trict squatters, wool farmers and what not all in a fever.
Even Tom Luxton is said to have gone to Ararat to see and
he conquered. To what extent he was conquered nobody
knows ; for “ Uncle Tom ” is too old a bird to twitter out
loudly, if the man with the gun is near. The mine is
helping the fever to continue by making gold yields. Last
fortnight’s 7310 z. did not include bottoms, and so
was lOOoz. better than that of the fortnight before.
This ought to have been good enough, but a 10s.
flop brought to some people a feeling that something
is not right inside. The following qutstions want
answering: Is the No. 12 rise wash developing poorly?
Is the run of rich gold narrow, and the run of total pay-
able dirt as a whole less than was expected ? Why is not
the panelling staff increased? Are the big holders sitting
tight ? If one could reply to these inquiries, he could get
at the bottom of a mystery that at present troubles
dealers far more than their prayers. There isn’t a strong
specking element in the market, and it is equally certain
there isn’t any public buying going on. Nor will there
be unless Bryant toes the IOOOoz. mark and earns the
2s. div. that was to be forthcoming with the New Year.

To look at the balance-sheet of the New
Imperial, Hiscock’s, the mine would seem to be a fat
show. Capital put up, £3150 ; gold, £92,455; dividends,
£15,750; spent on fuel, £13,426; ditto on timber,
£BOl2 ; and wages, £47,594. What these figures really tell
is that the capital put up was absolutely inadequate, that
the prosperity of the mine depends on the tributors, and
that the stone opened up was not much class. The
co.’s record for the last six months is 2861 tons
crushed for the co. itself for 4600 z., and 7747 tons
of contractors’ stone for 18630 z. The co. could
hardly have made a thrum out of an average
of 3Jdwt. per ton. Therefore profits, out of which a divi-
dend was paid and some shaft-sinking was done, must
have been drawn out of contractors’ percentages. The
co. is opening out at 530 ft. With about £lOOO in hand,
and Ballarat reliance on the tributor so strongly
developed, there isn’t much chance of the mine doing
more than hobble on like a lame duck.

Even with a mining co. Fortune doesn’t often
somersault as quickly as it has done with the Woah Hawp
Canton, the Ballarat East show which a while ago passed
into the hands of a Geelong company. Eight or nine
months ago things were very sick, and there was talk of
shutting down, though the directors say they didn’t
really mean to do it. Even in the early part of the past
half-year calls were being whipped in energetically.
Then, during June, the miners who were follow-
ing the Indicator in a rise above the 853 ft.
level struck a patch, and they went on strik-
ing patches. The revenue for the six months was
£17,120, and as expenses only mopped up £4716, there
was £12,404 of profit left. So on a paid capital of £2607
the co. let out £7982 in divs., put £3500 into outside
securities to form a reserve fund, and has still £921 of a
profit and loss balance. How much of this sort of thing
the co. is going to have in the future nobody can tell, of
course; but it starts to sink the shaft another 100 ft.
with very bright #
From Ballarat: The indicator hit by the Woah
Hawp Canton has given £17,000 of gold since it was
alighted upon in June. The lucky Geelong crowd which
owns the show has fallen very much from grace in the
eyes of the Ballarat professional director. The directors
have actuallv put £3650 to reserve, while dividends paid
have only been £7982. The Ballarat guinea-pig says :
“ It’s tomfoolery to lock up cash like that,” But this
little bit of finance is doing more to give the co. a repu-
tation than even the rich shoot did. Solid mining isn’t
being neglected. The shaft is to go down instanter ;
prospecting is being done at 830 ft., and, as the indicator
is o-oing strong underfoot, the outlook is that a good half-
year is ahead. The mine has more than one indicator,
and the chance of hitting a rich patch in others is just
as great as in the principal formation.
The Paramatta mine (S.A.), of which the
French co. made such a mess, has a heap of tailings,
estimated at about 30,000 tons, on which the Wallaroo
and Moonta Co. has had its eye for a couple of .years. No
other of the co.’s copper is so cheaply produced as the
little lot it gets out of the tailings ; all it has to do is to
make a few holes in the dumps, pump on sea-water
(preferably) and throw scrap iron in trenches to precipi-
tate the metal which the water leaches out of the dumps.
Even as it is scraped off the scrap iron the copper is
almost the real Mackay. For a paper-weight, writer has
a small sealed flask of it, 98 per cent. pure. The balance
is arsenic and similar trifles. Apparently the Paramatta
wants to raise a breath of wind somehow, so it has made
a deal with the big co. for its heap of “refuse.”
The much-discussed Tongkah Co. has finished its
third year. The net loss the first year was £3278 ; net
profit the second, £B3O : net profit for the past year,
£ll 382 out of which £7687 was paid in div. and div. tax.
During the year 13,250 shares were sold at a premium,
and this premium, less brokerage and expenses, has been
passed to the credit of profit and loss account—a most
questionable proceeding. The amount (£2755) ought to
have been treated as a reserve, not to be available for
dividends. To pass share premiums to profit and
loss simply paves the way for paying dividends
partly out of money subscribed by shareholders. In
1908 the total amount written off to cover depreciation
was £650 ; for the past year the accounts show £3976
written off. Of this £lBOO is “ estimated value of new
buckets and new spare parts.” Exclusive of that the
only amount written off is £2176, although the plant (in-
cluding dredgers) stands in the balance-sheet at £40,332.
In view of the admittedly worn-out state of much of the
plant and the unsuitableness of most of it, there is no
doubt that a great deal more than £2176 ought to have
been written off. If that had been done, the net profits
would have been much reduced. It looks as though the
management has made a very strenuous effort to put the
best possible face on the finances. On September 30 the
liquid assets (exclusive of the £5OOO lodged with the
Siamese Government, and not available) were £5550;
liabilities were £2164, leaving a surplus of £3387. On
consulting-engineer Bluek’s recommendation, the co. is to
at once have three new dredges constructed, and the
engineer is now in London preparing the plans, etc. The
cost of these will have to be provided somehow ; plainly
the present dredges cannot earn the money. Also nego-
tiations are in progress to commute the co.’s
undertaking to dredge a dock and channel for
a cash payment; if that comes off, the money
will also have to be raised. The present capital
is £150,000 in £1 shares fully paid. What sort of a bargain
the Siamese Government will drive it is impossible to say;
but it is probable that 50,000 shares will be authorised
to meet that and other outgoings. It is said that the
block could easily be placed in London at a premium of
possibly 10s.
Engineer Bluck’s full report on Tongkah isn’t
published, but apparently all the salient points are. He
admits that he can’t tell the -co. much more about
the property than it knows; and it knows very
little of a definite character. He, like everybody else
who has seen it, thinks in a general way that there are big
profits in it. “ The profits will probably be very large,”
he says, “ but of course I cannot put a value in figures
upon it: that would take months of prospecting.” Some
of the other officers of the co. haven’t been so modest.
Twelve months ago, in the co.’s annual report, Captain
Teddy Miles, then general manager, concluded his re-
marks with a forecast: this included dividends of 4s. per
share to be paid in 1909!
Waihi continues to be Maoriland’s great gold-
mining stand-by. The monthly production averages
over £70,000, and the total from the start recently passed
£8,000,000. About half of this has been profit. Share-
holders have just divided £99,181 (4s. per share). Includ-
ing' this, the dividends tot up to £3,616,181. Judging by
the price of Waihi shares, the market expects the mine to
produce another £8,000,000, and pay about Bs. out of
every pound to shareholders.

Mount Elliott Limited are now reconstructing
the whole of their smelting plant, which reconstruction
means entirely new steel buildings throughout, new blast
furnace, complete new forehearths, traversers, converters,
matte ladles, double slag pot carriages, mould cars,
gathering cars and electrically operated haulage gear,
weighing machines, drilling machines, a complete new
generating set with electric cranes for transporting con-
verters and various other motors, also a complete nen
tramway system. The whole of the foregoing work has
been placed in the hands of the well-known firm of
Mining Engineers, Messrs. Walkers Limited, of Mary-
borough, Queensland.*
The erection of the new 300-ton Blast Smelting
Furnace for the Great Fitzroy mine, Q., is now rapidly
approaching completion at the mine. The dimensions of
this furnace are as follows—l6Bin. x 44in., and 24ft.
high to feed floor. It is water jacketed from top to
bottom. These jackets are made of steel plates flanged
in one piece. The furnace was designed by the mine
superintendent, and has many features of excellence and
novelty in the detail of its construction. The jackets are
made interchangeable, only one type and size of jacket
being used ; and they will further be constructed so that
they are reversible from top to bottom—thus practically
the life of the jackets is doubled. This furnace, as well as
the previous one, was built at the works of the Austral
Otis Engineering Company, South Melbourne.* [2

WHEN THE HAIR FALLS OUT
It is a sign of scalp disease, and unless it has the prompt
attention of a specialist baldness will result.
The many advertised tonics cannot possibly cure,
because they do not go to the root of the trouble.
Mrs. Cowling, manageress of the Hygeia Institute, is a
specialist of wide experience who has had marvellous
success in treating all scalp troubles. Sufferers from
falling hair, dandruff, premature greyness or other
unhealthy conditions of the scalp should consult her
at once.
One has only to read a few of her many testimonials to
be convinced of her ability.
Mrs. Cowling gives free consultations every afternoon
but Saturday from 2.15 to 4.45, and, by appointment, on
Wednesday from 6to 7. Those who cannot see her
personally should write to her, enclosing 3d. in stamps,
and she will send copies of her testimonials and a

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 21, 1909.
My Dear Arini.-
All over Australia wailings worse than those
put Up by Jeremiah are arising from women left
servantless in the joyous time that lies between
late November and early January. During this
period quite half the women servants leave their
situations and stay with parents, friends or
in lodgings. When there are young children in the
deserted households the poor missus is deserving of
extra sympathy. If you look at the ad vts. you will
note the higher wages and the other inducements
offered: “No washing, comfortable home, gas stove,
most evenings free, no stairs.” This, of course,
applies mostly to where only one maid is kept.
The “general” is vanishing off the face of the
land. In time I believe geologists will dig up the
bones of the only known specimen of the general
servant, and Mary Ann will be reconstructed
and put in a museum. Cooks, housemaids and
parlor-maids may still be got, but the latter two
are also becoming rare birds. Some months ago,
when a couple of new restaurants were opened in
Sydney, 200 house and parlor-maids left their
places to take billets as waitresses in the new food
shops. The restaurant is a better matrimonial
agency than the private house. Besides, it is a
change, and a change even for the worse is dear to
the heart of the serving-damsel.
Four years ago, in 1906, this State started to
promote the immigration of domestic servants.
In that year it brought out seven girls. Next
year 186 came ; in the third year 643 ; and in the
year just closing 528. In all, 1364 young women
have been added to our domestic labor market.
These four years have been exceptionally pros-
perous ones in Australia; and the Australian-born
worker girl has been going into factories in in-
creased numbers, or qualifying as a typist or a
clerkess. Hence the huntresses of the “general,”
the housemaid and the nursegirl find the quarry
no more plentiful than before the Immigration
Bureau’s importations.
Recruiting is mostly done in Scotland, and the
bureau the morning after a vessel arrives hums
like a beehive in Glasgow. One of the immigra-
tion officials who secured, some 18 months ago, a
brown-heath and shaggy-wood nursegirl for his
infant son, now has the fun of listening to the
child and the nurse conversing in broad Scotch.
To the parents, a meat-dish is a meat-dish;
to their small boy it is a nashet. Very
few trained servants have come here among the
1300 odd, for thequite-competent domestic worker
is as eagerly sought after in the United Kingdom
as in the Commonwealth ; but the process of weed-
ing-ont is so stringent that, as a rule, only desirable
girls are finally accepted. A medical certificate,
references as to character, and favorable discharges
from two employers are requisites. Sometimes
freaks get through despite precautions. One went
to bed directly she took her first place in Sydney,
and for a fortnight left it at intervals only to get
her own meals. “ What did you come here for ? ”
demanded her exasperated employer. “For a
rest,” replied the freak. Then she was carried out,
bed and all, and left in the garden. As fresh air
was, next to getting-up, her chief aversion, she at
once sought another rest-cure house.
It takes some time to break the importation of
the locked window habit. She locks her bedroom
window on arrival, and only opens it in the day-
time when spoken to severely. Ah open window
at night—“it is verra danger-r-ous.” A. member
of the family sleeps outside on a verandah. “He
must be mahd.”
The respective capacities for learning of the
imported and the native-born girls are about
equal; the marked difference between them lies
in the thriftiness of the strangers and the spend-
thriftness of our own. The majority of the im-
porteds hoard their wages, do with the barest and
plainest necessaries in the way of clothes, and
spend nothing on amusements. Their ultimate
aim is to go in for some business of
their own. Mary Jane Australia has gene-
rally a liberal wardrobe. Her princess petti-
coats have wide (cheap) ribbons threaded
through their devious ways ; her one-piece frock
may be (in fact, must be) of cheap lingerie, but it
is an imitation of one the missus or her daughter
wears, and is worn with taste. Her plumed or
flowered hat is fashionably perishable. Her shoes
are white or tan, and her cotton hose are open-
work. The Australian girl’s instinct for dress
amounts to genius. I have known one who
had been working amongst cows for nearly all
her 17 years of life—one who had never worn
shoes in all that time—who came to Sydney, took
a situation, started acquiring a time-payment
wardrobe, and in six months looked like a fashion-
plate on her afternoons out. Her taste in colors
and accessories was unerring, and she wore her
hats at just the angle of the milliners’models in
the Lady’s Fashion-Plate. She would read
“ the newest fashion in hair-dressing,” and then
do her hair that way as well as if she had served
her time to the work. Possibly she has found her
right place in life, and is in a swell showroom by
now, for this gifted creature was about as intelli-
gent at housework as the cows she used to tend.
A coffee-royal alliance took place last week
at Nukualofa, Tonga, when George Tubou, of
Tonga, took for his missus Princess Ana
Seine Takiho. The two were married accord-
ing to the regulations of the Wesleyan
Church, and by a European minister. The bride
was resplendent in an Empire gown and all the
appurtenances and inconveniences of civilisation.
Alas ! for the swift days of old when the
groom, arrayed in the top hat of a servant
of the Lord who had gone to the stock pot,
would have carried off the girl of his savage
heart wrapped in her close-fitting cloak of cocoa-
nut oil. No fuss, no parson (unless for the wed-
ding breakfast), no Empire gown—nothing but a
yell splitting the night as the knob of a waddv
struck the perhaps reluctant father, a swift run-
ning through the heavy scents of the darkness,
and a large, excited brown girl hastening with her
bridegroom to the hut beneath the shade of the
sheltering passion tree.
On Wednesday of last week, the day after
Furnace Tuesday when the mercury tried to get
into Heaven, was married Mr. “Kodak”
O’Ferrall, of The Bulletin staff, to Miss Tantdn,
a pretty Maorilander.
On the Tuesday already obscurely hinted at
Sydney watched its temperature climbing on its
dead self to higher things until it stood at 103°.
It might have got higher if it had any more
previous personal corpse to stand on. Mogil
went 11° better with 114° in the shade. I don’t in
the least know where Mogil is situated, but I
shan’t fix my country house in such an aspiring dis-
trict. All the same, that 103° under the tree sounds
worse than it felt. It was a dry-hot-day,and we
went about our usual crust-earning merrily. To-day
is played upon by a cool nor’-easter, and is but
70° under the pepper trees and the cow’s shed, but
most of us have got the sleeping sickness —which
mauy people mistake for insomnia. There ,is
only one thing wrong with the Athanasian Creed ;
it does not cuss the nor’-easter. Yet it is a creed
of immense cuss-horse-power.
That incorrigible yachtsman, Mr. Walter Marks,
has bought the Awanui, the professional-beauty
cutter that looks on the water (from a distance)
like a cigar with a cigarette or two sticking up,
and tablecloths rioting thereon. With this craft
Mr. Marks will frolic at the Hobart Carnival,
and later contest the Sayonara Cup.
Mrs. Harry Chisholm is back from foreign parts,
and wearing the latest in short skirts and big hats.
A departer for a Maoriland holiday last week
was Miss Edith Hill, daughter of the behonorabled
“Willie” Hill; a nice girl and considerable
heiress.
I hear that Mr. Theo Marks is adding all sorts
of wings and rooms and ancestral halls and things
to Mr. Fat Osborne’s station, in anticipation of
the arrival of bis (Mr. Osborne’s) Madden
bride. The edifice in question is more or
less adjacent to Goulburn, which is a
sporting town that boasts a racecourse of
its own, as well as a flourishing Picnic R.C. It
lies within hail of Currandooley, which is the
biggest of the Osborne places, so the good-looking
Melbourne maiden shouldn’t find a back blocks life
wholly dead. The marriage is to occur the
moment the waning of the north wind renders
Melbourne a rational place to get wedded in.
Someone living on the coast in that part of the
State that the Tourist Bureau map has painted
green because it is the belt where the Cow gets
plenty of graze, writes to tell me that a marriage
which occurred the other day at Condong, on the
Tweed River, united the destinies of Mr. Cobham
Stuart, formerly of the Powerful, and Miss Gladys
Roberts, said to be a niece of Lord Roberts. She
had come all the way from Uncle “Bob’s”
country to share her orange-blossoms with the
ex-Powerful man.
The “Mr. Fairie” whom the cable told us the
other day had coldly refused an offer of £50,000
made by the Austrian Government for his horse
Bayardo is an Australian. His rightful name is
Cox —Fairie being a mere nom-de-moke. He
made his millions at the same place and time as
our Mr. Walter Hall, and adheres to them with
the same admirable tenacity. He has only one
extravagance^—viz., cigars. Mr. Hall beats that
record by a short head, for he, worthy man, has
no extravagances at all.
Chief Secretary Wood was married to Mrs.
Telford Mackenzie Young on Saturday at St.
James’. There was no bridal pomp. Bride was
simply dressed in white with a white and helio-
trope hat.
News has reached Sydney from a strictly un-
authentic source that a well-known Sydney pair
living in London have been put asunder by law on
the wife’s petition. She was a golden-haired
belle here some 12 or 15 years ago.
In a speech to suit her hat—both speech and hat
were simple, uncommon and pretty—Lady Poore
opened the Girls’ Pioneer Club at 100 King-street
on Friday, at afternoon tea-time. She made a
phrase that sticks in my usually bad memory :
“Paralysis of the affections.” It was to be
avoided. “In thy heart the dew of youth, on thy
lip the smile of truth ” is the.ideal condition to
cultivate, and the War Lady who works for peace
has, according to her own speaking, experienced a
certain rejuvenescence since she domiciled
in Australia. Reason : Her duties have thrown
her so much into the society of girls and their
work. The club consists of three simply-furnished
rooms, and if it will attract only half the number
of girls who obstruct the traffic opposite the Civil
Service Stores every day from 11a.m. to 1 p.m.
and from 4 to 5 p.m., it will be a city by-law unto
itself.
The committee-folk of the club must be members
of pioneer families of this State, but pioneer
blood is not a necessary qualification in a
member. Miss Christine Sparke, the founder, is
of the fourth generation of her family ; Miss
Blaxland, who is on the committee, is a grand-
daughter of the explorer who helped to open up
the Blue Mountains. Miss Madge Helmrieh, of
the fine contralto voice and the musical family, is
a grand-daughter of the first mayor of Padding-
ton, then next in importance to the city. Miss
Georgina Antill’s Australian family tree starts
with Major Henry Antili, who came here as
A.D.C. to Governor Macquarie. Colonel and
Major Antili who went a-warring to S’Africa are
grandsons of the A.D.C., who could use his pen
as well as his sword.
Mr. John Lauder, whose brother, Harry Lauder
makes £lO,OOO a year chanting Scotch dialect
songs, was married at Kurri Kurri last week. He
espoused Miss Mary Bell, of the district which he
inhabits. The local Mr. Lauder is no songster,
and earns an unobtrusive living in the employ of
the Pelaw Main Colliery Co.
The Defries pair leave their Cromer flat for
Melbourne this week. The Wright aeroplane is
not the vehicle for the chronic north-easter from
which Sydney suffers during the summer, and so
it is to be given a show in the sheltered Moonee
Valley, which is surrounded by enough hills to
ward off a blizzard. Apropos, the era when all,
or nearly all of us will be flying seems to be
drawing parlously close. The London Express
(27/10/’O9) reports the first case of prosecution for
furious flying in the history of the world. Mr.
Blanck, who crashed into a crowd near Paris
a while back and did various members of it
serious injury, is the defendant. If convicted
of air-hogging he stands to be mulcted in
heavy damages under the French law; likewise
he is liable to a term in gaol. Simultaneously
with the publication of Blanck’s trouble comes
the announcement that the latest musical comedy
bride has scored an aeroplane for a wedding
present. Miss May Kinder is the lady’s name.
She was performing in “ The Dollar Princess” at
Daly’s Theatre (London) when one Henry Astlev,
a son of Lady Florence Willoughby, found her
out and wedded her. The aeroplane—a Bleriot
model—was but one of the good 'and sufficient in-
ducements for her to change her name. When
air-hogs start to appear in the police court, and
aeroplanes start to figure amongst the wedding
gifts, it is safe to say that the days of the flier are
adjacent.
Miss Nellie Stewart departed from this State
on Thursday night, in an atmosphere of iodine,
flowers, friends and medical attentions. Her last
twirl in “ Zaza ” was the psychological one. Her
ankle sprained, and ten minutes later the damaged
foot was puffed like a balloon. A nice young
man with three orchids and two bits of maiden
hair in his button-hole, stood at the door of her
sleeper at the Central Station, and gently prodded
off anxious inquirers. The doctor was within
putting the dancing foot into its travelling case
(of splints) or some such. But the artiste’s win-
some face remains with us on a Christmas calendar
just issued by the Dunlop Rubber Co.
By the same train, but sleeperless, went Miss
Beatrice Day as far as Melbourne. She looked as
bright as Halley’s comet, and as gay as a person
who has just had the collar of the worker lifted
from her. She is not going to the West to see
her apples ripen just yet. In fact, she says she’ll
wait till the trees are planted. Southern ex-
presses for this week have been crowded, princi-
pally with mother and child or children, all
travelling sleeperless. Johnson hasn’t enough
coal to haul sleepers. When the trainfarers
arrive in Melbourne they must look like bundles
of second-hand garments with moans inside.
Miss Lydia Flopp (in collaboration with her
sister Fan) is nightly and daily causing mild
spasms of excitement at the Australia, where the
pair abide. There is nothing that enthralls your
typical hotel resident so much and so often as the
spectacle of a female mime in full work wrestling
with her food—unless, indeed, it be the spectacle
of a male mime doing the same thing. (By the
way, the latter joy is also accorded Australia-
patrons just now, for Julius, looking a clean-
shaved patriarch, is there.) In one respect,
at least, Miss Flopp is drearily conven-
tional. She is an inmate of Debrett. Her hus-
band is the Honorable Tollemache Wingfield,
his father being a lord of sorts. Any lady in
the musical comedy line who is over 22 and is not
married either to a peer or to the son of a peer,
these days, is regarded by Cold Land entrepre-
neurs as almost too revolutionary an original to be
worth employing. The Hon. Tollemache is not
here. It is rumored that he has stayed behind to
get a public strangle-hold on Mr. Lloyd George’s
budget when England’s intellect proceeds to de-
liver its verdict on that much-cursed piece of
legislation next month.
Florence Young’s share (the principal) in the
new three-act opera, “The Climax,” will be Ade-
lina von Hagan, an operatic student who is
tricked out of her voice. She has a big number,
“ The Song of the Soul.” But the incidental
music of the piece is altogether a strong feature.
Roberts, Atholwood, and young Titheradge are in
the cast. Atholwood has a capital character study
—an Italian music teacher.
Maggie Papakura, the noted Maori guide, has
the most adorable whare down at Clontarf, where
the just-erected village, inhabited by some 60
Maoris, drowses by the glittering waters
of Middle Harbor. It is hung around with
kiwi mats, and dolled-up flax mats, and
greenstone war-weapons, and specimens of old
carved boxes—“jewel” cases for the holding of
uncommon shells and kiwi feathers. The roof of
the dwelling is thatched with a good imitation of
raupo, and through the thatch glistens the bulb
of the electric light! And there is a modern suit-
case (for Maggie’s best tailor-made) in a corner of
the whare. Other adorable whares there are with
earVen fronts, and twice a day the inhabitants
sally forth and give performances —halcas, poi
dances, and concerts.
“ Boh ” sends this complaint:—
I have been to the theatre, and I have come to the
conclusion that if I could only-live m.v life supported by
the limelight, it would be a lot more interesting. To be
told that your mother’s marriage was a Scotch one, and
that the irregularity makes you an orphan or a ruin or
something in France or Greece, or some old place like
that, is hard : but when the band plays a soft strain of the
Spring Song, and you stand well up-stage, where the
limelight man can get you good and fair —well, it helps
you to bear it some. And then again when Gussie calls to
tell you “ he —is—going—to marry—a good—woman,”
and the band is so sorry to hear it that the fiddles get the
“ mutes” on and play the Melody in F carefully, and the
girl that is being' presented with the mitten stands with
her back to the perfect gentleman (who wears his
high hat in her drawing-room), and clenches her
hands, and kicks back her train, and heaves her shoulders
—well, no one can deny that the accessories put a selvage
on the situation. . .... I do hear a little music sometimes.
Every morning a cheerful fiend goes past in a rattling
milk cart. He whistles “Auld Lang Syne”—and never
strikes the tune. And on washing mornings—especially
wet ones—a man plays a cornet solo at the back gate.
It’s always the same cornet, and the same solo. And on
Friday afternoons a wrinkled son of Italy grinds out
“The Lost Chord.” And on Sunday evenings, wh-n I
am putting out the cat and bringing in the mat, the girl
over the road sings bravely through her nose, “ Art thou
weary V” etc. And when I think of the long, raw week that
lies before me, I could howl, like a dog at the watery
moon—which is the only limelight I get!
Mr. Justice Sly and other bewigged gentlemen
who have the job of keeping the bandage tight
over the eyes of Justice in sections of the Matri-
monial Causes Act must often think their work
funnier than seeing a fat man sit down where
there is no chair. Last week Mr. Sly had to
adjudicate upon a divorce suit based upon great
cruelty on the part of the husband. His Honor
in delivering judgment explained that the evidence
went to show that the misconduct complained
of was committed for three months only
out; of the twelve, and that was not suf-
ficient, as it must be shown that the
cruelty complained of continued throughout
the year. He therefore dismissed the petition.
Technically and legally-speaking, the husband
had not sufficiently walloped his wife. .Aine
months of thrashings are due to her. But if she
returns to the amiable respondent, and takes all
that’s coming her way, will the nine months be
sufficient to work out her salvation ? Or will the
Judge insist when the case comes on again that
the foregone three months of poundings have
nothing to do with the fresh suit, and that she
must work out her full year? Women here
have got the franchise, and they might put it
to worse use than by working for the alteration of a
clause that demands that a wife must be ill-treated
during a whole year before getting release from
the person who had endowed her with all his
worldlv goods (he had really thrown them at her),
and assured her that with his body he worshipped
her, whereas he only whipped her.
More motor-cabs are to roam about Sydney
streets. In a few months 60 of these hooters will
be on wheel. The motor-van carrying several
tons is here, and for the sake of the poor, dear horse
let us hope it will increase and multiply in the
land. On one’s walks abroad one is always
harrowed by the sight of heavily-laden horses
straining up one or other of ' Sydney’s steep hill-
roads. The motor ought to be the horse’s joss
when he comes to neigh his prayers.
The buttermilk craze has laid hold of Sydney
as with talons. Some of the tea-rooms and all the
leading hotels now have buttermilk on their
menus and in their bars. Men especially are
making a practice of “a morning butterniilk,”

There won’t be much time for charity between
Thursday, the day you’ll see this letter, and
Christmas, but St. Brigid’s Orphanage at Ryde
is calling, and if you sprint you may send some-
thing there before the shops shut on Christmas Eve.
The orphanage provides home and education for
nearly 100 little orphaned children, and the
Sisters in charge will be glad of any little help, be
it in money, food or clothes, to provide a Christmas
treat for them.
Yours affectionately,

Five well-known members of the Reps, will
be seen no more in apolitical sense —Fysh,; Ewing,
Watson, Dugald Thomson and G. H. Reid.
And there will be other vanishments. Anyone
who looks over the lists can spot half a dozen
assured burials; in fact, he can hear the hammer-
ing of the coffin-builder quite audibly.
The finishing touch has just been given to
another monument to the Commonwealth tariff,
and 200 employees will make a start at Bryant and
May’s new match factory at Richmond (A ic.) on
Jan. 3, while 500 are expected to be drawing wages
before 1911 comes along. Safeties and brown
wax matches only are to be made, so there will
be no danger of “ phossy jaw ” or other brands of
phosphorus poison. The only article to be im-
ported will be the timber for the safeties —Russian
poplar—and that will come in bulk. When in
full swing the machinery will fire out 1250 miles
of lights per day, equal to 13,000,000,000 matches
a year.

THE MOST

PIANO SUCCESS
OF THE AGE.
MANY PIANOS have what is known as a “ local reputation.” In a
certain City or State they may be well known, but outside of a limited
area there is no demand for them.
The STECK PIANOLA PIANO has a reputation which extends all
over the world, into every country where there are cultured music-lovers. In
London, in New York, in San Francisco, in Paris, Berlin, Vienna and St.
Petersburg, the Steck Pianola Piano has a strong following amongst the most
progressive people. That is what is meant when it is said that the Pianola
Piano is the standard instrument of its class throughout the world.
It is always agreeable to know that one’s personal judgment is ratified
by those whose opinions carry the most weight.
THE STECK PIANOLA PIANO is an upright piano of the highest grade,
and, in addition, contains within its case a complete Themodist and
Metrostyle Pianola, the only piano-playing device endorsed by the greatest
living musicians.
It can be played by the fingers on the keyboard in the usual way.
It can be played by means of a Pianola action within its case.
There is nothing to move up in front of the keyboard. To change from
hand-playing to Pianola-playing it is only necessary to slide pack a panel in
the front of the case, and insert a perforated roll of music.
If unable to call, you should write for a catalogue. Simply write and ask
for Catalogue C. You will get it at once, post paid.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 20, 1909.
Mr Dear Yarrik,—
“Owing to pressure of business in both Houses
of Parliament, the garden party will not take
place.” So flew the apologetic notes last week.
Thank goodness,-political affairs were absorbing
enough for once to even block a garden party. It
rises almost to the tragic point of the Prime
Minister’s dilemma in Bernard Shaw’s “Press
Cuttings,” wherein the curate, imprisoned on
political grounds, is thereby forced to cut “10
garden parties and 12 at-homes.”
The garden party that was sacrificed to a
nation’s needs was to have been at Government
Cottage, Macedon. It would have been a sort of
sassiefy day in the country—a picnic glori-
fied , by motors instead of furniture vans
and butchers’ carts. It is a real fine run
up the steep sides of Macedon ; with fine gums
and tanglpd briar and scented underbrush thick
at the roadside’s, and beautiful gardens all along.
The’flbwers have a cool look in summer at Mace-
don. One big nursery garden spreading through
the wilderness sends flowers daily even to Sydney.
Another marvellous garden belonged to the Ellis
people. Mrs. Ellis Rowan—that famous botanist
who has wandered over the steep wild
places of the world for flora, and . who
painted a complete collection bf Australian
flowers—lived much of her girl-life in that garden.
The Government cottage, has its share of roses.
It is a beautiful dwelling, built altogether of
Australian hardwoods.- David 1 Syrne built the
place as one of his many country humpies (Syme
had homes in all directions in beautiful country
parts), and sold it eventually to Guv’ment House
upholders. There was really some sense in plan-
ning a garden-party at that. beautiful garden.
Perhaps some day the Houses will be settled
enough to allow the procession to take place.
Justice Hodges and his bride started their brief
honeymoon at Hepburn, motoring thither from
Ballarat on their wedding day. Hepburn, near
Daylesford, is the place where the mineral water
comes from, so the learned groom and lady passed
some of their hours in making pilgrimages to and
fro between the springs and the' boarding house
wliere they abided, she concealing-her blushes
under a violet-tinted sunshade the while. A
handsome pair of veterans they looked. The lady,
some years younger than her husband, is grey-
haired and “ the figure of a
girl,” to use the common expression. Walking
together on the quiet Daylesford-road, they
seemed very much in keeping with the surround-
ings ; but somehow the harmonious effect failed to
impress a drag-load of local visitors, who greeted
the Judge and his wife with a roar of applause
followed by shouts of “six months without the
option.” Probably the perturbed gentleman
found consolation in the thought .that he might
have the pleasure of meeting some of his barrackers
in another place one of these days.
Among the break-up and general smash of
schools before vacation the Farlight shivoo was
the most crashing. This school has spanked and
coddled many of the feminine grown-ups of Mel-
bourne what time they were in tender years. Miss
Chambers, the former priestess of the academy,
has sold all her rights-of-spank, etc., in girls to Miss
Henderson, a younger general in the ranks of
Moulders. Miss Chambers is taking what she
calls the Sabbath of her life, and has bought a
cottage perched on the rocky cliffs atFrankston,
where one gazes over stretches of bay and
through the Heads upon leagues of ocean. The
girls farewelled their old priestess most atfec-
j tionately, and a break-up present was a purse
that held somewhat more than half a hundred
sovereigns wherewith to buy a memento.
Gilbert remarks feelingly that at times “ a
policeman’s lot is not a ha-a-apy one,” but a
whole opera might be written round the lot of a
mayoress. Last Saturday—the final of the much-
sagged Austral Wheel Races —Mrs. Burston
christened a balloon which was to enhance
the entertainment by hauling a female para-
chutist into mid air. The balloon’s temper
had been much tried by the ups and downs
' of the weather; and when a blue-gowned
lady laughingly threw a glass of champagne in
; its face—well, it exploded. Mrs. Burston escaped
j —but more inquisitive people were buried beneath
fragments of b’loon and the grime and gas of its
inside. The Mayoress fled to pin a blue riband to
' the Austral hero who dodged the holocaust of a
general spill in the biggest heat. The latter
affair was as good as a bull-fight. The beautiful
Macgillicuddy medico dashed into the thick of it
j to patch up a tangled-mangled cyclist.
“ The strike has not affected Melbourne much,”
; said a sweet girl of my acquaintance, most think-.
I ingly. “There is only one train taken off on our
line.” Yet they say women don’t rise to the level
j of big questions.
IJnannexed Girl wails that the nurses make a
matrimonial monopoly of doctors. A fresh in-
stance has happened to show the strength of the
, ring. Dr. Arthur Morris, who hangs out a
1 Collins-street plate, is engaged to Nurse Chomley,
one of the daughters of Judge Chomley. Medico
Morris is a grandson of George Higinbotham. the
! Great, and a son of the late Professor Morris,
who, whilst chasing English words at the Uni-
versity, married a daughter of the distinguished
I George.
The £ £ Smiths are in bad luck. Their
Beaconsfield house—a fine country humpy,
; whither the family move, parrot, cat and all, for
the dog days—has been burnt to cinders. A
wandering bush fire got its tongue on it, and now
it is no more.
A girl who, for love of helpless sick bush-folk,
did Outback nursing work before district nursing
was classified, has been yarning to me. Hebe are
j some scraps of her talk :
The “nusses” won’t need to be giddy city girls, who
will run away with the squattahs and the farmers. They
i will have to be able to ride, walk, and not get “ scart” in
the bush o’ nights. Also, the district nurse must learn
' how to sterilize instruments in a teacupful of water, and-
wash her patient with the rest. If she strikes a northern
backblox in the summer it won’t he any fun.
She will, no doubt, have to milk the coo if she wants
some milk for her patient while the men are away fight-
ing a bush fire ; and her off-duty hours will have to be
spent in a woolly-mat, waxen-flowered drorin’ room—or a
bedroom “ shared” with half the “ fambly.”
If she has to go an errand she must saddle her own
moke or walk ; and she will be kept busy fighting flies on
the verandah and Syrian pedlars at the door when she
isn’t fighting disease inside the house.
One of the recreations a bush nurse will have is the
“darnce”held in the school-house occasionally, and if
she is worth her salt she will be popular, especially if she
can play the “ Merry Widdy ” waltz on the harmonium.
A cocky will, however, occasionally come up to her and
pluck her by the sleeve and say, “ Will you ? ” And if
she will, he will pull her out into the middle of the floor
and keep her there tee-toe-tumming round in a tiny
circle with his two hands firmly pressed on to her
waist whilst her two hands will lie on his shoulders.
They will look into one another’s eyes, but never speak.
Darncing is too solemn an affair for speech. Even in the
Larncers the only sounds which break the stillness are
the heavy thuds of the boots, and the cries of the M.C.,
who demands, “Gents to the centy’’—then “lydies to
the centy,” and again bids all to “ sashy ” ; and if she can
leave her patient she will do that till daylight.
Country folk are great visitors, and they will arrive by
the buggy-load and stay all day. Nurse will be expected
to feed them, and keep them all out of the sick room at
the same time.
Considering all things, a bush nurse is born, not made ;
and Lady Dudley’s idea of bush women being trained for
the position is really the only one.
The community is howling on the track of a
grey motor-car. The person who “shoved” it
ran down a man and rushed away into the dark-
ness with his implement. He who motes and runs
away may live to mote another day. The man
lies looking at death in the hospital, while a wife
and half a dozen youngsters wail for him and his
ceased wages ; and he of the grey car sits munch-
ing his four meals a day, and cunningly says
nuffin.
Pantomime and Christmas—the same hot,
uncanny sort of feeling does for both ; one is part
and parcel of the other. J. C. Williamson got in
his crash of spectacular effect first, and on
Saturday night Her Majesty’s stretched the
seven-and-sixpennv reserve right back to
the skied seats of the back circle. Phydora
strained his sense of humor, or some such part of
his anatomy, and could not appear; so under-
studies and general twist-up put the pantomime
out of gear. Pantomime has to be on. the boil,
like water for tea, or the brew is flat and
dull. The new Boy is a daisy, with rare
curves and a manner all her own—not
modelled on every panto. Boy of the moment.
The Girl is disappointing. She disguises her good
looks in a ferocious Charles 11. wig of black curls,
and hides her body in multitudinous draping-*—
which is a wicked sin in a pantomiino girl.
Possibly Australians are spoilt in the man-
ner of dancing—they are used to good dancing
among the home-grown product, and can
see no particular mirth in the type of
gambol the Girl indulges in. The Boy has not
much of a dance to do, but her legs are a joy. Miss
Boy Iris is a saucy wench, with a contradictory
reminder at times of the deVere of Olive Morbll
(now elevated to the ranks cf -..e high and motor-
carred). Brown and mouse-colored tights are the
piece de resistance of the Iris unfrocking; but a
black and white satin coat of the Newmarket
variety just knocks things. But it is waste for
Iris-Aladdin, in this rig, to make love to a Girl
swaddled in pink like a spring mummy.
A first night of a pantoni.me is often discon-
nected and disjointed, and when the theatre and
stage were plunged into black darkness—not even
the footlights being left agleam—a liorrif ed house
thought the Complete Strike had come. A lime-
light dazzler in a balloon emerged from the
nothingness and broke the strain. The airy lady
returned to black nothingness with a smile and
the mystery of Anna at the seance. It was most
telling—especially on the baldheads she nearly
kicked.
One thing about the scenery was an Aus-
tralian Bush background. That background
should go abroad—though some Australian
city c tizens need the education almost
as much as benighted foreigners. It was
gum trees —gum trees with sensitive taper fingers
and almost a fragrance, and the wattle was
in all its blurred glory—not sprigged priggishly.
Tree fern looked cool and real, and made a
shadowy background for lyre birds that fluttered
out from the dank, cool depth as a ballet. Every
other kind of bird followed, even to kookaburras
with their soft brown and white toggery. The
dances were all a success. The Fire ballet should
have had a woman shrieking the Inflammatus.
Tiie flames were all human—from big white
hungry flames that start a fire to the hot
small leaping flames that devour the last dross,
and the glowing sparks that fly upward. Cute
management got a sense of vast space by banking
the stage to its farthest back with blazing rocks.
The ballet of flames looked a small demoniacal
circle. MacCunn (who has gone off with the
“ Dandies ” crew) made the weird music.
Mouse-colored maidens, clad in a smile and a
wreath of paper-plant, made a South Sea Islanders’
dance, finishing up weirdly with a blurring of the
dancing limelights. There are enough ballets to
spread over half a dozen operas, and if the piffle
will only wake up and be lively, self-respecting
piffle, the pantomime will fill all possible require-
ments.
Here and there in the pantomime house people
hit out who took an eye even from the embarrass-
ment of gorgeous showmanship. Mrs. Edwards
had her hair mobbed like.a Fijian chief, with the
fold powder a-top of its fairness. The Carlyle
mythes perch for a brief spell in Melbourne
from Maoriland wanderings. Mrs. Smythe was
hung with Maoriland stones and draped pleasingly.
The Railway Tait three were imposing. Mrs
Hall and daughter Marie, who have been fare-
welling for Colombo for a succession of recent
boats, were still in strong First Night evidence.
A strong society strain will take its pantomime
in steady doses between its motorings to distant
sand heaps.
At race time in Melbourne Melba played
accompaniment to. Lucy Atkins’ warbling at an
At Home of the Paynes of Maritimo. Miss Atkins
belongs to Evandale'(Central Tasmania), and she
lived some time in Launceston, and more recently
in Hobart. An enthusiastic girl-pal writes that
Melba gave Miss Lucy “ a white enamel pendant
with a design in amethysts and a frock of white
ninon on a satin lining to wear at her concert, ’
and it is written with an air of finality ; as “what
more could any girl want?” Lessons and such
tripe are as nothing to the ninon and the pendant.
The Black Man at the Royal still draws his
mighty house. All his power of acting cannot
obliterate the instinctive horror one feels at the
sight of his black paw caressing the white woman s
head. He is a picturesque enough circumstance
in isolated possession of the stage. Asche has
artistically altered the redness of his mouth, and
tinted down its ruby melon-slice appearance with
dusky grease paint. The new and ugly adver-
tisement curtain still shouts its way along.
After a big scene, when one’s mind is swing-
ing with the rhythm of Shakspeare’s wording,
it is a sudden anti-climax to be urged to buy half
a pound of somebody’s ready-made pork clothes
with an extra pair of pants thrown in, or to wear
some publican’s intoxicating hat .on your feet in
order to avoid paying rent. The hoarding curtain
is not only glaring but inadequate. The feet of
the scene-shifters are flung before the footlights,
and sometimes two brown extremities in gold
Moorish slippers are revealed in a critical and
thoughtful attitude. It is very primitive, but not
primitive in a Shakspearian way.
The Dunlop Rubber people have vented their
admiration of Nellie Stewart in a sepia portrait
the size of a Dreadnought, attached to a calendar
for next year.
From " Rosna,” who is still in Adelaide :
The Dudleys passed through here on their way to
Colombo on Thursday, and the Outer Harbor had its
waves curled as a gentle tribute, and fired a gun or two at
nothing in particular. Our own Ex. snatched a moment
from the toil of handing prizes to victorious school
infants, and, hurrying down, said a breathless “ pleased-
to-meet-you.” And Attorney-General Mitchell was
also there to say the Ministry sent its love and blessing.
So naturally the Dudleys went away quite happy.
A three nights’ outburst of literary plays occurred last
week, and once more much of the population was sent
weeping away for want of space. On the first night three
fine productions were given—“ Makeshifts,” by Gertrude
Itobins, a clever little tragi-comedy in which the suburban
atmosphere is excellently caught; “Bon Secours,” by
Eva Anstruther, a strong though brief miracle play ; and
Rutherford Mayne’s “ At the Turn of the Road,” consider-
ably heavier than the others. It is a comedy of grasping
North of Ireland fanners, and here, too, the atmosphere
is excellent.
The second night’s plays were rather less interesting.
They were Lawrence Binyon’s “Paris and (Enone,” a
tame, meandering Turgenief play, in which the plot, is
deftly concealed ; and “ Hyacinth Halvey,” Lady
Gregory’s clever little comedy of a man who wanted to
lose his reputation and couldn't. Arthur Adams’
“Doctor Death” was responsible for the chief interest
on the third evening, it was a fine work finely done.
Wilfred Neill, the best amateur we have, made a capital
study of the Man. Frank Wilkinson was Doctor Death,
a whimsical and ghastly gentleman who gave the
audience the spinal shivers. George Whittle was the
friend, and Carmen Wright the girl, and neither could
have been much better. Other plays the same evening
were Ernest Dowson’s fantasy, “ The Pierrot of the
Minute,” and the much-discussed and satiric “Press
Cqttings ”by Bernard Shaw. Next year, this movement
is to wear the imposing title of “ The Adelaide Literary
Theatre,” and since so much interest is being taken in it .
on all sides and at the corners, it will .be organised on a
larger scale. Members may join at a fixed yearly sub-
scription (entitling them to peg out two reserved seats),
add they are proceeding to do the same with considerable
ardor.
Meanwhile the Appendreena amateurs have had their
periodical outburst of drama, at the VValkerville Hall.
The play was Pinero’s “ Dandy Dick,” and every chair in
the hull wore evening dress and a bow in its hair. An
Appendreena show that didn’t crain the edifice would
never hold up its head again. As usual, there were
streaks of brilliant mumming and slices that didn’t scin-
tillate, Ethelwyn Robin was the very sportive lady
whose terse phrases gave the peerage something to talk
about on the way home. Mr. Neil again shone conspicu-
ously, and Mr. F. C. Ward scored a palm or two as the
harassed cleric.
Miss Thorndyke, who has been playing to sweet Marie
Narelle’s bird notes in Westralia, dropped On these shores
last week with the news that Marie was already on the
raging brine bound for Britain. A tempting American
engagement caused the songstress to drop her Australian
tour, and depart without even flying back to farewell her
bairns.
Our fiddler child, Daisy Kennedy of the red-brown
mane, now studying in Vienna, has met Mrs. Doubleday
and Leila in that village. The Doubledays have been
kind to the Adelaide maiden ; and the two youngsters,
who are of the same age, are now doing their climb to
fame side by side.
The Castles company, without the Castles, will take
time by the front, curl and give several concerts here
after its Messiah-ing. There are to be several country
outbursts, and probably one in town, and an interesting
circumstance is the fact that Muriel Cheek, our sweetest
young soprano, has been engaged as she-vocalist of the
party. This is a feather in a deserving piece of millinery.
The C. H. Angas folk, with their small son, have just
drifted back into South Aus. Mrs. Angas has been in
the British speck for some time ; for when you have a
daughter who is a twig of the peerage, even the tremen-
dous gaieties of Adelaide fail to drag you from her side.
At length, however, the fond mother has been persuaded
to leave the twig in its motored?grange;and come back to
view the family’s other prize asset —the jumbuck that
frisks about Lindsay Park.
Apropos jumbueks and ,such\rural matters, a bush fire
has devastated half of Anlaby run, belonging- to Squire
Dutton. The thing didn’t even confine itself to the Ser-
vants’ Walk or the Tradesmen’s'Entrance, but penetrated
the Vice-regal Avenue and the Visitors’ Drive, and
threatened to smudge the countenance of the palatial
residence itself. Fortunately it was suppressed before
this supreme impertinence could be achieved.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
The sort of Outback note that drops in
on The Bulletin; every day of its life (this one
comes from Mossman, N.Q.): —
A lot of us Australians are getting very sick of this
“ everything for Sydney.” (By-the-bye, who keeps the
pub there now?) Who is running this continent of ours?
Sydney—or the National Parliament ? What claims has
Sydney more than any other town in Australia? We
hear a lot about a chap called Wade who is always poking-
his nose into Australian affairs, i Who the —— is he more
than any other Australian? jit’s about up to us, it
appears to me, either to shake things up or change the
name of this country to Sydney. Is there a railway to
be built? It must lead to Sydney. Are we to ba\e a
naval dockyard ? It must be in Sydney. Should ammu-
nition factories or ironworks be started ? Sydney is i n
place. Should we decide to build a capital, its supplies
must go through Sydney. And should the little
Monkey pay us an official visit, I expect we shall be a_ke l
down to stand by Sydney. Damn Svdnt.y .

scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanently it is essential to cleanse the affected
tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while allaying all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies thoroughly.
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wound 3, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases in cases of long standing.
This famous Ointment is now manufactured in
Australia, and will h- sent post paid to any
address upon receipt of price— 3/6.
Please note— Chase’s Universal Ointment is
always supplied in glass jars to avoid contact
with metal.

An Extreme Case of St.
Vitus’ Dance.
A Grateful Mother’s Statement
for the Benefit of Other
Sufferers.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have restored to per-
fect health a young lady born in Newcastle, nowa
resident of Sydney, whose health and happiness
were completely shattered by that insidious
disease, St. Vitus’ Dance. Hospital treatment
failed to benefit her, and for fifteen months she was
a helpless, speechless cripple, unable to utter a
word. The value of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills as a
nerve tonic has never been shown to greater ad van-
tage. Here is the account of her cure, given by
her mother, Mrs. J. Wright, off King Street,
Newcastle:—
“ A number of years ago my daughter Edith,
who was then twelve years of age, developed St.
Vitus’ Dance. A blow while playing with
children so frightened her that she began to have
terrible twitchings. She was treated for the com-
plaint, but grew worse, and had no control what-
ever over her body. Her movements were
terrible to witness. She finally lost all power of
speech. For fifteen months she couldn’t utter a
word. We finally decided to send her to the
Newcastle Hospital. She was so bad that she had
to be carried there. She was six weeks in the
hospital, where she had to be screened, owing to
herterribletwitchings. The doctors said that it was
one of the worst cases they had ever seen. When
she came out of the hospital she was little if any
better, and was not able to speak. A friend,
Miss Payne, advised us to try Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, and after using them for a time we began to
notice a great improvement. She regained her
strength, and the twitchings left her, while she
became stronger in every'way. She removed to
Sydney, where she continued to take Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and was ultimately completely cured.”
The young lady in question is now Mrs. Edith
Gibb, 23 Levy Street, Chippendale.
Remember only the genuine Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills cure. Don’t be gulled into taking something
said to be just as good. Of all dealers at 2s. fid.

POLITIACL
POINTS
Despite all the reductions in the N.S.W.
railway service during the coal-hunger, Johnson
never dared to lay a sacrilegious finger on those
special morning trains which rush the Herald
and Telegraph out early that they 1 may arrive in
time to cut the throat of the country paper. The
man who interfered with them would touch the
Ark of the Covenant, and the anger of Whiskers
Ward would go forth against him, and he would
be consumed.
In New York the sufferings of those who
sing the Song of the Shirt have so moved certain
wealthy ladies that they have joined the Blouse
Makers’Union and are agitating for better con-
.ditions. The daughter of Pierpont Morgan gave
way to a burst of pathos at a public meeting, and
said that when women could only earn 325. a week
there was indeed something wrong. And so there
is—but how much is wrong in Freetrade England
where the Song of the Shirt only brings in about
Hid. a day ?
OUR DRY COMMISSIONER.
George Houston Reid, K.C.M.G., yesterday received
from the Prime Minister a formal offer of appointment as
the first High Commissioner for the Commonwealth of
Australia in London, and during the day sent to Mr.
Deakin a formal acceptance of the position.
The appointment, according to the terms of the Act,
is for five years, and carries with it a salary of £3OOO per
annum, with an allowance for residence of £2OOO per
annum.
George: “ Why, Half red, of course I will; but
only as a mark of very great friendship. I
wouldn't do it for anybody else, ?/’ know.”
It is amazing how our Tory State Govern-
ments always find that everything is wanted so
suddenly that nothing can possibly be made here,
but all things must be imported from England.
The N.S.W. Government has just discovered that
it was such a short-sighted incompetent that it
didn’t foresee the need for a new dredge till the
very last second, therefore the blessed article had
to be built in England. It could almost certainly
have been got ready more rapidly here, for a
dredge takes four or five months to crawl out from
England ; but when it is a case of discouraging a
local industry a very poor excuse is good enough.
The family stimulant—Wolfe’s Schnapps—
should be in every home. A drink. A medicine.*
The country still awaits Johnson’s explana-
tion. That eminent N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioner had a contract for Wallsend coal at
9s. fid. per ton, but as soon as the strike com-
menced he joyously paid 40s. a ton for the
coal. He had a contract for Abermain coal
at 9s. 10d., and for that also he paid 405., to
the great enrichment of the coal bosse'is. But as
regards the coal produced by the miners at mines
which they worked themselves Johnson com-
mandeered that at 10s. a ton. And any.'explana-
tion which Johnson has offered has been about as
brilliant as the light from a brown lamp.
Tunnecliffe, M.L.A. of Victoria, recently
tried to define a living wage, and to that end he
attempted to add this explanatory clause to John
Murray’s Factories Bill:
Living wage means sufficient to provide for the normal
needs of the average employee of the trade concerned,
regarded as a human being in a civilised community, and
sufficient to provide food, shelter, clothing, frugal com-
fort and provision for old age.
It is a poor definition. A living wage should not
only provide for the needs of an average employee,
but should also provide for a nice, average wife,
and not less than four average children,
“Shy Bird” writes :
We are federated without a doubt, yet a stranger within
our gates might be excused for thinking otherwise if he
read a recent case in the Victorian County Court. The
Melbourne Pigeon Homing Club conducted a race from
Wagga (N.S.W.) to Melbourne, and the first pigeon
allegedly arrived home about 70 miles ahead of pigeon
No. 2. The committee flatly refused to believe that any
fowl came all the way from Wagga in the time alleged.
In fact, it disqualified the bird. The angry owner sued
the club for the prize money; but before his Gent One
got fairly into his stride Gent Two took the point that
Wagga, being over the Murray, was outside the
Court’s knowledge or jurisdiction. The Judge agreed
that the County Court had never heard of Wagga, and
had no means of knowing that any pigeon could start
from there. Now the chances are that the corresponding
Court in N.S.W. never heard of Melbourne ; so there you
are. And yet both Courts have often asked the juvenile
witness in a stern voice if he is aware that he will go to
Hell if he doesn’t tell the truth. It is a strangely lopsided
Court that never heard of Wagga yet knows everything
about Hell.
Woeful Wade, in his amending N.S.W.
Industrial Act, included one clause that may yet
recoil with tremendous force upon himself and
the gang behind him. It is :
42a. If any officer of police of or above the rank of
sergeant has reasonable grounds to believe that any
building or place is being used for a meeting for the pur-
pose of instigating to, or aiding in or managing, or
aiding in the continuance of a lockout or strike, he may
enter such building or place, and may, if necessary,
obtain assistance and use force by breaking open doors or
otherwise for making such entry, and may seize any
documents which he reasonably suspects to relate to any
lock-out or strike, or intended lock-out or strike.
That clause gives the N.S.W. police the most
oppressive power exercised by the police of
the worst and most oppressive foreign tyrannies—•
the power of making domiciliary visits without
warrant. The Austrian or French police never
had the power even in the bad times between ’4B
and ’66. They could not search a private house
for papers or anything else without a warrant, and
such work was never entrusted to a policeman of
non-commissioned rank. It was too serious and
responsible a business.
Premier Ward, of Maoriland, is going to
have some interesting experiences with his new
Land Bill, which proposes to give the lessees-in-
perpetuitv the right to purchase their holdings at
the value the land had when they first camped on
it, plus , roughly, one-tenth of the increase in the
unimproved value. About one-third of the mem-
bers of the M.L. House of Representatives are
leasehold advocates, and practically all of them
belong to Ward’s own party; and they have
given a good, middle-sized hint that they intend
to haul .Toe’s arrangement over all the coals in the
Dominion. Bart of the Cabinet itself has a
vague idea that somebody is going to rob the
community, and unless the Boss can dope one or
two Ministers before extracting their deeply-
rooted principles, there is going to be trouble for
Joseph very close home.
Rip Van Winkle, in the shape of “ a pro-
minent Government supporter,” woke up at Syd-
ney on December 16, and was interviewed by the
Evening News. He yawned as follows :
Reviewing the events of the past five weeks, what has
struck me most has been the absolute confidence reposed
in the Government to see the public through this trouble.
And yet this was the sort of brick that the Gov-
ernment’s best supporters had just been throw-
ing at it: —
And the Government that has been placed in the
possession of responsibility seems helpless to allow the
people to carry out their self-imposed obligations. . . .
Already the community has waited long, and its patience,
prolonged beyond its natural limits by the enforced in-
activity of the head of the State, has now well-nigh reached
breaking point. It is felt that there cannot any longer
be two competing bodies of rulers, that either the strike
congress must be stricken down by the strong arm of the
law, buttressed by an unflinching body of public opinion,
or the Government may as well, at once and for all, yield
up’the reins to firmer hnnds.— S. M. Herald ( 13/12/’O9 ).
There already exists more legislative machinery for the
suppression of strikes than the Government is" able to
make operative, and any addition to the stock would,
under these circumstances, only tend to confound con-
fusion.—Sydney Telegraph (lo'lllll’O'J).
A glaring instance of greasing the fat sow
came to light recently, while the Estimates were
under consideration in Maoriland Parliament, the
animal in this case being Chief Justice Stout. It
was discovered that his Judgeship had drawn
double pay for one year’s graft—viz., £2OOO as
Chief Justice and another £2OOO in connection
with the Native Land inquiry. This unwhole-
some arrangement was fixed up in defiance of the
law, which says that Parliament shall have a say
in fixing the remuneration to be paid to Judges.
Having collected his dole, Stout was given a six
months’ holiday at the close of the land inquiry,
and went to England on full pay. In the mean-
time Joe Ward was busy figuring out how many
of the small fry in the public service could be
retrenched in order to pay for the M.L. battleship
that is to be ; stationed at China.
The fact that coal-ownership ought to be
a Commonwealth matter was illustrated the other
day when the Port Melbourne municipal council,
looking round on the local devastation, resolved
unanimously that Gregory Wade be recommended
to give the Newcastle owners 48 hours’notice to
grant an open conference or hand over their
leases. But Wade won’t lose much sleep through
that resolution, seeing that Port Melbourne hasn’t
got a vote for the N. S. Wales State Parliament.
But it has several votes for the Commonwealth
Parliament; wherefore it is clearly to Port Mel-
bourne’s advantage that the coal-mining business
should be controlled by the authority over which
it has some pull.
AT YASSBURRA.
Ist Kid: “Have a lark , Ginger ?”
2nd Kid : “ I'm. on.”
Ist Kid : “ Well, let's roll this stone in the river
and cut oft the Federal capital’s water supply.”
The Government of Jocook and Co., with
startling brilliance, has decided to call the Aus-
tralian torpedo destroyers after rivers of the
continent—“Parramatta,” “ Yarra,” etc. But
what have the mighty Molonglo and the colossal
Cotter done that they should be overlooked ?
Melbourne’s Board of Shirks doesn’t en-
courage leanings towards a public life in its em-
ployees. A State servant who aspires to the
Assembly, the Reps, or the Senate is expected to
resign on starting*his campaign; but the Board isn’t
satisfied with even that much. On learning that
one of its clerks had been selected to contest the
Corio seat, it promptly ordered him to drop the
idea or “take the sack,” although the elections
are still four months away. Possibly the fact that
he is to stand in the Labor interest had some-
thing to do with the Board’s strenuousness : had
he been a Fat candidate it wouldn’t have mat-
tered—he would probably have got a rise to go on
with.
The Yic. Closer Settlement Board seems
to have suffered a happy resurrection, and it is
now proposing to gambol about in £ s. d. with all
the vigor of its brilliant youth. Under the Closer
Settlement Act it is allowed £500,000 a year with
which to buy up any large estates that it cares to
take ; but it has been so cautious with its money
that it hasra balance of £1,500,000 unspent. See-
ing that tfcje annual half-million will still be avail-
able, it will have for the next three years
£1,000,000 per annum to throw to hungry land-
owners. A Melbourne paper announces “ that it
is understood that offers of a considerable number
of properties have been secured.” That sounds
promising, and the Board ought to have a glorious
time buying up estates at their fair value
multiplied by three.
The Old Soldier writes :
Despite the perpetual repetition of the senseless parrot-
cry about “Revolution” by the morning papers, no one
seems to have more than the haziest idea what sort of
animal a Revolution really is. No one has, so far, said a
word about setting up an Australian Republic, or depos-
ing King Edward, or even shipping off Governor-General
Dudley to Norfolk Island, though there is a precedent
for conduct of that sort in the deposition and deporta-
tion of Governor Bligh. That was a typical revolution ;an
official and military insurrection. Some of our purest pure-
merino families profited by the rising that upset poor old
Bligh, who ought, if he had his due, to be reverenced as
a victim of revolutionary violence. Revolutions are not
often the result of conspiracies, but that which deposed
Bligh was, and a descendant of one of the chief conspirators
is now a prominent anti-revolutionary politician. That
is generally the way. There was no more violent anti-
revolutionary in ’7O than little Adolphe Thiers, member
of the French Provisional Government of ’lB.
“ Billem ” and a few- Premiers
It is significant that sick Premier Wade appointed
Works colleague O. A. Lee acting-Premier. If this is the
tip as to what would happen should he call himself to the
Supreme Court Bench, then Tom Waddell and cross-
grained Wood will be disappointed. It is known that
Wood is very ambitious to head a Government; but if
his ambition ever materialised, he would he able to hold
onto its tail end for a very brief period. Any Govern-
ment he was leader of would possibly run,smoothly for a
month, and then one fine morning the public would be
startled by the shrieks of an Executive being' torn limb
from limb and pursued on its way to Gehenna by a
Premier with a blood-stained axe. Why Twaddle wants
another opportunity to worry himself with a Premiership
passes comprehension, unless it is that, having mortgaged
so many of the State’s assets to Cohen, he feels he would
have more opportunity, as Premier, of putting up
a mortgage record. Lee, who has represented
Tenterfield since 1884, succeeded Reid as leader
of the N.S.W.- Opposition when the • Federa-
tion was established ; but he chucked up the,
job in disgust owing to intrigue and internecine torment.
When Lee speeches there is nothing so dreary in the
vicinity, even if it is a deserted pub ; but he has a talent
for precise and definite statement, and is not tainted with
intolerance or mean-niindedness. If Wade sacks himself
as Premier and gives himself a job as Judge, Lee will
probably be called on to reconstruct the Calamity.
The S. M. llerald the other day chortled
over the magnitude of the Commonwealth s
external trade, and printed a list of the twelve
chief ports; after which it philosophised like
this:—
It will be noted that, whereas New South Wales,
Victoria and South Australia have only two ports each
apDearing in the above list, and that Western Australia
and Tasmania have but one each, Queensland has no less
than four. In the course of time this will probably prove
of considerable benefit to the Northern State.
If it is a good thing for Queensland to have four
ports, it must be a good thing for N.S.W. to also
have four ports; yet the Herald supports the
policv of dragging everything to Sydney, so that
N.S.W. shallbe quite unlike Queensland. When
it was proposed to make the Federal capital on
Monaro, with a big Federal port at Twofold
Bay, the poor old paper nearly burst with
anxiety lest the Commonwealth should fit up a
harbor that would take three-pennorth of trade
from Sydney. Under the circumstances, and on
the Herald’s own confession of what is good for
a State, it looks as if it doesn’t care whether the
"State gets what is good for it or not so long as the
paper gets what is good for the S. M. Herald and
the city which it misleads.
If you want to get up in the morning feel-
ing rested and refreshed, and filled with vim and
energy, take a dose of Chamberlain’s Tablets
before retiring.*
A HIDEOUS SUGGESTION.
[For Thk BulTiRtin.]
Under the heading “State Governors—Should They
Be Abolished ? ” S. M. Herald noted (16/12/’O9) that the
aholition would mean a saving-of £lB,OOO per annum in
the case of each State.
Perish the thought that the.v should go,
These folks whom we allow
Each year—be taxes high or low—
Their steady eighteen thou. !
It is unthinkable, and so
I lodge this protest now.
Picture the land bereft of Govs.,
Ye sordid ones who prate
Of saving sundry paltry sovs.
I Each year. This anguished State
AVhich all assail and no one loves,
Would be quite desolate.
Lacking a State Official Head
The festive A.D.C.
Would never visit us ; a dread
And dire contingency.
Our local heiresses unwed
Would permanently be.
No royal words of cheer would speed
To those who’d garnered fame,
Such as Boy Scouts and G. H. Reid ;
Disloyalty would flame
About the State like some rank weed,
And Sosh would do the same.
Tt makes the thoughtful burgess weep
To think, while we can splash
Round notes, from pawnshops o’er the deep,
There should be folks so rash
As not to hold State Gov’nors cheap
At any price in cash.
N.S.W.
JABEZ.
THE EDITOR’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The coal supply, in short, is to be controlled by the
miners as absolutely as though it belonged to them. No
one ever saw or read or heard of such lordly, slavery as
this. It is almost calculated to make ambitious people
who are neither strikers nor miners wish that ihey were
one or both, so that they could savor the kingly joys of
“ slavery ” and know what it is to be a truculent “ slave
dealing out disaster to the common public. —Sydney
Telegraph (15/18/09).
I sit in my eobwebbed sanctum,
And dream as the linos sing
Of the opportunities wasted,
For I might have been a king ;
I weep for the years flown past me
While I grubbed in my lonely cave—
Why was I not ambitious?
I might have been Him —the Slave 1
The paste brush slops and slithers
In the hand that has missed its chance ;
Instead of the wand of kingship
I carry the goose-quill lance.
And what are the gains of my toiling
In face of the gains I crave?
I would savor the joys of bondage—
Sup high with m’lord the Slave.
Still, I’ve done my best in the circle
That Fate has tethered me in ;
I’ve dealt it out to the public
’Til I feel I’m all but kin
To the Lords of the Revolution,
To the Knights of the Red Conclave—
Cheers for Calamity’s double,
Myself and my friend the Slave !

SPROTING
NOTIONS
Saturday last was a day of tumbling water in
Port Jackson (N.S.W.), and the wash of the wild nor’-
easter provedjtoo much for quite a number of the smaller
open boats. So numerous crews went bathing. Even
the little motor launches (of 10 miles per hour and less)
felt the fury of it away up the Parramatta River on the
run from Gore Bay to Rodd Island and back, and some of
them had to retire. The Royal Yacht Squadron, of
course, simply revelled in it, and ran off the first leg of
the Lipton Cup. This superb trophy, made in Sydney
by Hardy Brothers to the order of Tea Lipton, is a'thing
worth striving for, and the first man to get possession of
it is Mr. Crane, with Sunbeam. The race was confined to
yachts of eight metres and under, so only six started.
Mr. Trebeck’s Petrel was on scratch, and Sunbeam had
three minutes, Yeulba five, Janet and Magic seven. Little
Culwulla 11. had 30min. start. Petrel bounded away in
great style, followed by Sunbeam, Magic, Culwulla, Yeulba
and Janet. As usual in a dead thresh, Petrel broke right
away from the fleet, and reached Manly buoy nearly
2min. ahead of Yeulba, followed by Sunbeam and Janet.
The way Janet shook out the spinnaker was beautiful.
Then Sunbeam began to move through the water very
fast, and at Shark Island was closing up on Petrel, which
was passed before reaching Fort Denison, where the time
between them was 30sec. But at the Pile Light Petrel
was once more ahead with lmin. 30see. to spare. Then
came the tussle : With spinnakers aloft they raced away
to Shark Island, where Sunbeam was only 56sec. behind.
But Petrel’s skipper handled his yacht beautifully, and
managed to cross the line with ssec. to spare. When the
time adjustments were worked out. Sunbeam had won,
with Yeulba second, and the fast-sailing Petrel third.

That terrific blaze in the timber yards of Messrs.
Saxton and Binns at Balmain is responsible for the beauti-
ful Sydney yacht Awanui changing owners. As every-
body knows, Awanui is the challenger for the Sayonara
Cup, and as Mr. Saxton will be unable, owing to the
reorganisation of his big business, to spare time to go to
Melbourne, he offered the yacht to Mr. Walter Marks.
And Mr. Marks accepted it, and will now race the
Awanui for the Sayonara Cup and Culwulla 11. for the
Northcote Cup. The Victorians had no boat to defend the
Northcote Cup, and Mr. Marks could, presumably, have
claimed a walk over, but he wasn’t looking for that sort
of animal. So he agreed to a shifting of the date to
allow the Victorians to build a boat, and the vessel will
be ready to race in March next. Mr. Marks now desires
to kill both birds on the one journey and have the two
races held together. If the Victorians agree, the first or
second week in March will be an important time. Now
that he has acquired the Awanui, he has planned out
a delightful run, and will sail the yacht to Hobart and
take part in some racing there ; then head for Melbourne
for the Sayonara Cup, and then away back to Sydney—a
total distance of 1661 miles.

N.S.W. Motor Boat Club has finished its year,
and is showing signs of emerging, from the state of
lethargy into which it seemed to have fallen. The state
was inevitable. When the club burst like Minerva on
the public gaze, fully developed, with the largest tonnage
in the world, and' created in one day a practically new
sport, it was bound to create an enthusiasm that could
hardly last. There had to be a settling down, arid
when the first stage of wonder had passed away and the
first great burst of races for the championship of the
Harbor was over, the club was not ready with something
of a permanent character to sustain public interest. But
the public was intensely interested in'any sort of a motor-
boat race, and no matter how insignificant or inclement
the weather, crowds always lined up on headlands and
bluffs to watch the struggle. The real trouble
was that the club members went in more for
pleasure than racing, tand racing craft were so few
that the question of supremacy ,was soon settled. There
has been talk of introducing one-class racing, all racing
boats to be made to a common pattern and fitted with a
standard power motor, so that the actual supremacy
would depend not on the engine but the man behind it.
It is a good scheme, and would probably make for much
interest —but it is expensive. It is not so expensive as
the all-in system of racing, but motoring in any form is
costly. Still the fact remains that if the club advertised
its races more, and laid on facilities for the public to
watch the doings of such craft as are already in existence,
the public interest is still warm enough to make the sport
flourish. •

When Perth (W.A,-) is.feeling clammy and has
accumulated red dust on top of the sticky surface, it hies
away to Cottesloe and dips in the briny, and also spends
much cash in light' refreshments at the tea-rooms and
such like places. Wherefore Cottesloe Council regards
the fair fame of its beach with great jealousy, and falls
heavily on the camera fiend and other unpleasant insects
who try to disturb the dippers in their glee. Hitherto
the council has stamped flat all caitiffs who have offended
in any way ; but it has now struck its Cannse, its dead
limit, and all the rest of it. The council finds itself help-
less to cope with a nut-brown maid who jeopardises the
reputation of the place by her fearsome recklessness.
She swims away to sea right out of sight, and the unco
guid of uncertain age declare that she has an affair with a
merman. Sometimes it is an hour or two before she
swims back, and lately she has raised the hair of the
community by a wild threat to swim to Rottnest Island,
11 miles out. Anxiety about the nut-brown maid destroys
the enjoyment of the rest of the dippers, and people stay
away rather than have their feelings harrowed up by
worrying about her. The council fears that if she gets
cramp, or falls foul of a shark, or fails to return on
general principles, Cottesloe will lose its good name and
its beach be branded as dangerous, and it has asked the
police department to prevent her swimming under such
dangerous conditions. So just now the best and hand-
somest of the Perth traps are being trained to long-
distance swimming should the lady try to avoid police
interference by paddling outside the territorial limit.
The motor-car record between Melbourne and
Sydney, established by Harry .James and C. B. Kellow,
when those two daredevils flew over the 572 miles in 25hr.
40min., has been smashed. A bigger and darerdeviler
person, hight G. G. White, of Adelaide, dashed over the
distance in 21hr. 19min. in a 35-h.p. car. Mr. White also
holds the Adelaide to Melbourne record of 589 miles in
20hr. 6min. All of which goes to prove that Mr. White
has moved some.

There’s a mighty careful medico in Melbourne.
With a 16-20-h.p, car he managed to get 11,700 miles out
of one set of tyres on the driving wheels, and 18,000 miles
out of the front wheels. Considering that his car weighs
30cwt., and allowing for the broken nature of his work
and a few other things, that medico has done well, and
has been a good and faithful chauffeur to himself. If he
is as careful over his patients, he deserves any good thing
that comes his way. But, after all, it’s the make that
tells ; and the secret is in the fact that the tyres were
branded “ Dunlop.” That one word explains manj' mar-
vellous things.*

E. A. Pearson will shortly be again on the job,
to recover his lost punch, or rather the Sydney-Melb.
record that Salvana grabbed so neatly from him in
55hr. 56min. Pearson is training hard, and will probably
apply himself to the task about Eastertide, which begins
in March this year.

The meagre attendance at the Austral Wheel
Race finals clearly showed that it wasn’t bike-racing or
ballooning but the promised aeroplane flights that drew
the 20,000 the previous Saturday in Melbourne. The
’plane show had been a frost, and the parachutists and
wheelmen between them could only attract 5000 or
6000, more than half dead-heads. So the great Austral,
which started in ’B6 with trophies worth £260. and in 1905
had reached a cash value of £650, was hardly worth to
the club the advertised minimum prizes of £6O, £BO and
£lO- , Yet the few who did turn up had an
exciting afternoon. The machines skidded and buckled
on the slippery grass, and in nearly every race
somebody came down. In the Austral final, just as
Pianta and Harris broke away from the bunched dozen,
A. Lloyd skidded and A. Aplin, Eekhardt, Orlowski and
others toppled over him in a shivery mass. Luckily they
fell on grass, and only Orlowski was badly damaged. He
was taken to the hospital with a concussed brain.
Between the scene of the wreck and the tape, Pianta, who
started at 210yds., gained four lengths on Harris, who was
just as far ahead of Glencross. Time, 4min. 27 l-ssecs.
The score of Ikeys, who bellowed hard for the few bets
they took, offered 4 to 1 Davies, 5 to 1 Pianta and A.
Aplin, 6 to 10 to 1 others. The Derby was annexed by
H. W. Nesbitt, Davis second, and H. Thomas third. At
intervals in the proceedings two balloons were filled, and
Penfold and Miss Mostyn prepared to do a daring dash to
earth per parachute, but both the gasbags split, so the
ascents were off.
* * * *
The combination of cycling and aviation at the
Austral meeting at Melbourne was a howling failure from a
spectacular poiht of view. The biking was far from gaj%
and the aeroplanes planed never at all, and nary a soul
went up in the balloon. In fact, one balloon went up in
smoke and flame and the other soared on its lonesome,
so that the race back to earth between Penfold and Miss
Mostyn did not eventuate. The only excitement was
where a crowd of cyclists struck the earth with consider-
able vigor.

N. S.W. cyclist George Horder had an attempt at
Dick Mutton’s Australasian one-mile unpaced record of
2min. 6sec. recently, and equalled the figures. There
was a gale blowing at the time, and the open Sydney
Sports Ground isn’t a place to upset records upon when
the wind is high. During the season, Horder has struggled
to put up new figures at many distances, but failed ; still
as he is riding well be has yet a chance to snatch the
bauble.

“ M.P.” : Roller-skating has gripped the young
Australian from Hobart to Northern Queensland. The
old rinks of the former boom have been resurrected, and
are filled with the hum and rattle of the modern ball-
bearing skate. Many of these so-called rinks are merely
large shops and halls. In the shops, the skating is more
or less on puss-in-the-corner lines. The skaters push
their way along on uneven boards from one shop to
another through apertures in the walls. Maryborough
(Queensland) does its skating that way—-in and out of a
couple of shops. Bundaberg (same territory) has, how-
ever, built itself an open-air rink ; and Gympie glides the
evenings away in a big hall. Of the structures in this
section of the planet, none beats Wirths’ Palace, in Mel-
bourne. It has a reinforced concrete floor of immense
length, is semi-open-air, with a sliding roof and a gallery
with cushioned sit-downs. Every evening a stream of
girl and man swirls about the floor, while here and there
an ancient waves his whiskers among the best. A vermi-
celli band supplies the music—the only part of the show
that isn’t Australian.

Tennis followers are shaking their heads over
the alleged somewhat gloomy prospect of the future :
“ What’s to become of us when Brookes and Wilding
go?” they inquire plaintively. This paper cannot see
any cause for despair. This is a young country from a
tennis standpoint, and yet it holds the world’s cham-
pionship. That fact will probably boom the game, and
then we shall produce champions galore on the courts as
we have in every other branch of athletics. There are
shoals of fine young players coming on, and some of them
should some day rise to the level of Brookes and Wilding.
Dunlop and Heath, f’rinstance, although they did not keep
the Davis Cup in Australasia, were good enough to down
the visiting Amurkans. If tennis is properly fostered and
popularised by organising the game on a district basis,ino
matter how large the districts may be at the first, there
is but little doubt the Davis Cup will come this way very
often, even if it does not stay here permanently.
The cricket match between Queensland and an
eleven of N.S.W. in Brisbane resulted, as usual, in a win
for Ma’s team, this time by seven wickets. Bananalapd
knocked up 180 and 260, while N.S.W. got 380 and 63 for
three wickets. Goddard (108 hot out), Thomas (96) and
skipper Hodgkinson (62) dealt severely with Queensland’s
trundling: while most of the Northern State’s batsmen
found Docker, the Burwood fast bowler, too much for
them. He took four for 65 and five for 67. The batting
of Fennelly, who was playing his first inter-State match,
was the only thing, that made the Bananalanders feel
happy. He scored 41 and 97.
Saturday’s cricket in Sydney was- exciting, and
the most astonished club on Saturday night was Glebe.
It hasn’t yet quite grasped what struck it, hut whatever
it was it wore the disguise of one Wilcocks, who felled
seven of its wickets for 47 runs—a hideous thing, indeed.
University had left 243 on the board —a mere trifle to the
terrific smiters of Glebe. Then came the deluge. The
top score was 35, and amidst the clatter of falling
wickets Glebe saw itself being pushed down from the
position of second on the list. And this was the song of
Burwood : With eight wickets down for 409, the suburb
where George Reid used to live felt it was in
a safe place and declared. Redfern could make but
a feeble reply, and with a total of 292 found it-
self beaten by 117 runs. North Sydney also made a fine
exhibition with 373 for five wickets down, and the unfor-
tunate Balmain could make only 203 in reply. Verdict
for 170 runs with five wickets to go. Petersham bumped
Paddington with 274 in the first innings. Then Padding-
ton made 201, and Petersham started on the second trip.
It stopped with 101 for one wicket down and gave its
opponent a show, but the opponent could only rake up
151 with two wickets down. Then the shades of evening
fell and Paddington crawled away 23 runs to the bad.
Central Cumberland downed Sydney by 69 runs on the
first innings.
The chief result is to keep Burwood at the top
of the competition with nine points. Petersham is
running ciose behind with seven points ; Central Cumber-
land has six ; while Glebe, Uni. and Middle Harbor are
together with four each. North Sydney has two, and all
after that are below zero.
There was nothing particularly brilliant about
the batting, the top score being 83 by Small, of Burwood.
Small was the biggest scorer of the day. Nicholls, of
Redfern, and Mackenzie, of Waverley, put up 79 and 77
respectively ; while Mclntosh, of University, had his 75.
Among the bowlers Wilcocks, aforementioned, was easily
best with his seven wickets for 47 —and Glebe wickets
at that. Prentice, of Burwood. took four Redfern wickets
for 23 ; Moore, of North Sydney, got away with five
Balmain sticks for 39 ; and Blackman, of Sydney, took
three of Central Cumberland for 27.
* * * *
Clem Hill and D. Gehrs are the batting but-
tresses of South Australia. Against Victoria, Hill scored
176 and Gehrs 118. Against N.S.W., Hill came along
with 205 and Gehrs piled up 72. Clem retired from
cricket and took to bowls, but the joy of smiting the
ball wasn’t in bowls, and he is once again the finest S.
Australian batsman. With Ransford (Vic.), Bardsley
(N.S.W.) and Hill (S. A.) in form, Australia has three left-
handers who are capable of wrecking most bowling oppo-
sition.
* * * *
There was some refreshing batting in Melbourne
pennant cricket last Saturday when South Melbourne
whacked up 285 for six wickets against the bowling of
North Melbourne. The star batsman of the troupe was
A. Kenny, who carried his bat for 156 not out. St. Kilda
compiled 262 for eight wickets against Northcote,
Ainslie contributing a modest century to the total.
Melbourne made 291 against Richmond by grace
of Vaughan’s 144, and Richmond, at time of
writing, had responded with two miserable wickets
for 20 runs. University made 184 against P’ran, and
P’ran’s answer thereto is 85 for one wicket. At time of
writing, Fitzroy is already walloped by C irlton. It had a
miserable showing of 107, and Carlton’s record is already
114 for one wicket—so what will the harvest be? But
the surprise of the day was when Essendon smacked up
293 for nine wickets against East Melbourne, towards
which Kortland piled 117 from his own solitary hunk of
timber.

The dry bones of football are rustling, and
already there is a whisper of Maori teams. Both the
Union and the League will bring Maoris to Sydney the
coming season, and compete fiercely with one another.
In fact, the noble savages who have taken to football and
the howls thereof are among Maoriland’s chief exports
nowadays. People who take an interest in what is known
as Australian Football, which would be better entitled
Human Chess, would be delighted to hear that the Aus-
tralian League has secured the Erskineville Oval (Sydney),
and is likely to acquire other grounds during the season.
With a few closed-in fields that will yield “gate,” the
Australian game should go ahead. Possibly it might do
better if the management were better—but that is
another story.

Recently-arrived Yankee files throw an interest-
ing sidelight on the turning-down of Mclntosh’s offer of
£15,000 for the Jeffries-Johnson fight. Jeffries said
bluntly it vyas not enough, and that he would fight for
nothing less than 100,000 dollars. So far it is not on
record that anyone has offered that amount; and when
Jeffries opened his head and delivered the ultimatum,
managers one and all declared that “ this guy is trying to
raise us out of it.” The only places in the States where
the fight can be fought to a finish without legal interfer-
ence are California and Nevada ; and as the people who
run bruising in those parts hold a practical monopoly,
they are not likely to give all the gate and a bit over even
for the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jeffries lick the Big Smoke.

“Philadelphia Jack O’Brien” has broken out
in a new place, and has staggered even the sensation-sated
Yanks. He declares that all the great bruisers have been
unconscious hypnotists, and have had their victims fixed
with a glittering eye before ever the scrap began. He
declares that Jeffries is an unconscious but 50-h.p.
hypnotist, and when he meets Johnson he will work the
shining optic, and Johnson will promptly scramble
through the ropes. He himself has been developing his
hypnotic powers, and is now raging round seeking a pug
on whom he can test them. He says there is nothing in
the Queensberry rules against it, and therefore it is quite
fair.
After all, the position of colored champion pug
of the World is not a bed of roses. When Ketchell fought
Johnson the “usual formality” of shaking hands was
dispensed with. It was a weird scrap. Once Johnson
forced Ketchell on to the ropes, then picked him up
bodily, carried him to the middle of the ring and re-
quested him not to flee off the premises. In reply Ket-
chell swung a right that just missed Johnson ; had
it got home it is reckoned that it would have
ended the fight right there. After that, Johnson
did not try any more carrying acts, and contented him-
self with showing his gold-lined mouth in a wide grin.
The grin vanished suddenly when, in round seven,
Ketchell suddenly stood in close and swung a left on to
Johnson’s jaw that raised a lump about as big as a
turkey’s egg. The crowd rose as one man, and requested
Ketchell to “kill the cow.” But Ketchell wasn’t able.
The disparity between the men was terrific, and on size
Johnson ought to have eaten the white man. But to give
him his due, he said before the scrap that he would win
in the 12th round, and he did. Also he won from the
broad of his back, having been laid out by a right smash..
A curious fact was that Johnson’s famous right uppercut
was quite useless against Ketchell, and .Johnson seemed
puzzled thereat. But what astonished him more was
that the pigmy down below uppercut him. Only Ketchell
and his father know how he did it.

“ Health and Strength, Ltd.,” of London, has
published George Hackenschmidt’s “Complete Science
of Wrestling,” in which the game is described and illus-
trated from the moment you sh,ake hands till the eventful
time when you hoist the other fellow over your shoulder,
and landing him on hikhead; roll him on the mat. Hackv
is probably the kindest hearted Than who ever got a giant
swing on his fellow-creature, and is admittedly the para-
gon of gentlemanly wrestlers! But all the same his book
is a revelation of the innate brutality of wrestling. At no
other pastime is a man so likely to receive life-long injury.
In fact, an “all in ” wrestling match is a wild-beast fight
for life. An unscrupulous coippetitor can make things
fairly barbaric, as Hackenschmidt found when he met the
unpleasant person named Gotch in the U.S.A. Toe-
breaking, nostril-bursting, eye-gouging are not among
the things that Hackenschmidt tells one how to do. His
book is clean and wholesome, and well worth study.

Contrary ,to expectation, Mclntosh will not
referee the fight between Fitzsimmons and Lang. Asked
who he wanted for a referee, Fitz mentioned one by the
curious name of Damifioare ; but Lang: said Arthur Scott;
and Arthur Scott will duly officiate. Fitz grot summoned
to court for furious motor driving the other day, much to
his astonishment. Mclntosh was bringing him away
from the Stadium in the big Daimler car he brought back
with him, when the policeman at the top of William-
street held up his omnipotent hand. The car stopped
dead, and the officer demanded name and address. “Oh
put it down to Bob Fitzsimmons,” said Mac. And down
it went. For the rest of the run Mclntosh was shaken
with bursts of laughter which eventually roused the
veteran’s curiosity. “ What am I laughingat ? —you’ll be
summoned for furious driving, that’s all.” And, curiously
enough, Robert was more frightened of facing the beak
than of the wildest slugger he had ever encountered.
* * * *
If Mclntosh has done nothing else, he can claim
to have made bruising a family pastime in Sydney, and
whole families—father, mother and the kids —now hie
them to the Stadium on Saturday afternoons and watch
novices and ex-world champions deal out stoush to their
fellow-men. Of the two classes, the novices naturally
indulge in the more genuine work. They stoush with all
their heart and biff with every ounce of soul that is with-
in them. That experienced novice, Lane, on Saturday
found himself up against the toughest nut he was ever
called upon to crack. The nut called himself Woko, or
some such name; but he biffed cheerily and drove
straight drives into the middle of Lane’s dial and worried
that handsome young man considerably. Also he dodged
effectively and landed neat counters that made Lane look
commonplace. Writer would not dream of disputing the
verdict of so fair a referee and skilled a boxer as
“ Snowy ” Baker, but, all the same, he cannot help saying
that had he, the writer, been referee he would
have made it a draw. The struggle of the middleweight
division was that between Land and Smith. Smith
danced in cheerfully, and, taking his punishment in an
airy, gentlemanly manner, put it all over Land for three
solid rounds. But in the fourth Land cut loose and won
in the final rush. Had Smith had the skill to get out of
the way, or the ability to drive a straight right or left,
he would have outed Land for a certainty ; but it was
this inability that lost him the scrap.
The arrival of Burns and Fitzsimmons in the
ring was the signal for a fearsome upheaval. Both these
men appear to be popular idols —Heaven knows why.
Had a member of the Strike Congress appeared be could
not have got a more royal reception. With two such
masters in the ring, naturally there was no referee—they
were a law unto themselves; and the exhibition they
gave convinced writer that “ sparring ” is a good game—
to watch other fools indulge in. Burns, with the face of
a tiger and the apparent fury of 16 bulls, charged the old
man and dealt it out in a violent manner. He landed on
the old, old face ; but the youthful, lithe body glode
away easily and with a graceful celerity that
was beautiful to watch. And over Burns’ smashing
drives came fearsome right hooks that made the
man who looks like Napoleon shake again. Round and
round the ring they went, and as the red blood gleamed
in the sunlight pepple wondered whether it was a spar-
ring match or a world-championship fight. No genuine
fight could have looked more real. There was not a
moment’s pause, and it was top speed from start to
finish. With a terrific smash Burns seemed to open up a
great cut from the bridge of the nose away across the
forehead. “ Sorry, Fitz. old man!” he remarked as he
bored in. “ Don’t mention it, dear boy,” said Fitz bring-
ing in a right hook as Tahmmy’s drive went over his
shoulder and bringing the left up with a rip. Then, as
they swung out, the gong sounded.
The spar between Burns and Fitzsimmons
throws an interesting light on the Lang scrap. From
the jump Burns made the pace torrid, but Fitz showed
that he has amazing skill and wonderful speed. Of
course it is hard to say how 7 it would have been had both
men been out to kill. Burns was certainly hitting much
harder than Fitz. But it was very noticeable that, when
Burns became too hot, Fitz had the strength and the
ability to check him. Tahmmy got no change out of it.
Fitz demonstrated that he is quite the other man’s
equal in ring generalship, and, when he wanted it, he
had a punch that even so determined and gritty a man
as Burns had respect unto. The question is—has Lang
enough youthful stamina to weigh down the other man’s
skill and strength? Youth is always dangerous.

The A.J.C. December meeting on Saturday
brought back to Ikey Moses a little of the coin be un-
loaded through Prince Foote’s Melbourne Cup triumph,
as well as some of what, he has dropped since then at
suburban meetings. The Nursery Handicap winner,
Orodes, by the imported Persian Knight, out of Thea,
started absolutely unbacked beyond the investing of an
odd half-sov. here and there by someone who thought
such a good-looking youngster might possibly land the
money. Ambassador carried a fair amount of bullion in the
Holiday Handicap, but not nearly as much as would have
been the case had the stable fancied him. A few days
before, on the track, he went under badly to Son of the
Marsh, who shaped poorly in the Yilliers Stakes, run an
hour or so prior to Ambassador’s success. ’Twas said
that the owner only' speculated £ 10, yet his horse won
from end to end ; the red-hot favorite, the unlucky
Grey Plume, was six lengths away, t hird. Marlee’s win of
the last race of the day—theHigh-WeightHandicap—was
a staggerer, and, to a man, he of the raucous voice
admitted having had ‘‘ a,skinner.” Marlee’s preliminary
gallop discovered stiffness and soreness, and his owner
gave him no chance ; yet he, the biggest outsider of the
field and without even the semblance of brilliancy, settled
the favorite —the famous Poseidon’s full brother, Orcus,
who cost 3050 guineas as a yearling, and who, though
four years old, is still a maiden. The success of the New-
castle mare, Miss Flaneur, in the Villiers’ Stakes (one
mile) was an ey'e-opener—the easiest win seen at Rand-
wick for many a day. In the straight she completely
spreadeagled the 16 other starters, and finished only 7 Jsec.
behind the record time for the race. Miss Flaneur will
surely 7 (all going well) do greater things in the near
future. She is by Ruenalf by Paragraph, and undoubtedly 7
a splendid galloper.
The “ Marathon Fund sports at Botany
(N.S.W.) on Saturday will put a good sum in the bag
towards sending. Andy Wood and A. R. Sime to Athens
next year. A lorig and varied programme was disposed
of, and the enthusiast who didn’t see sufficient bard labor
for his shilling had a mighty 7 appetite. The dreary part
of the meeting was the eternal running of heats. It took
10 heats for the first round of the 100yds. handicap.
A BALLADE OF THE PUNTERS’ BURDENS.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The burden of the bookie, young or old,
Sharp on the hill or welsher on the flat;
Raucous and bandy, red-faced, bald and fat;
Swollen with pride, and rich with punters’ gold ;
Guzzling rare wines and puffing big cigars ;
Be-diamonded and gorgeous of attire ;
Lord of the lawn and prince of private bars :
This is the end of every book’s desire.
The burden of the tipster: thin and sly,
Ragged and rough, and wolfish in his looks ;
Glib in his speech and ready with his lie ;
Chatting the mugs and touting for the books ;
Full of times, tips, results and trial spins;
Giving the dinkum chat, the dead-straight wire ;
Scaling the drunk, biting the flat who wins :
This is the end of every tout’s desire.
The burden of the dead ’un : very dead ;
Stiffened or stuffed, and buried in the bag ;
Readied by rooks that punters may be bled,
And books reap skinners on some outcast nag ;
When morals fail and certs keep out of sight;
And jocks are crook, and owners up for hire ;
And dead birds die, and roughies come to light:
This is the end of every rook’s desire.
L’Envoi.
Punters, give heed to this most mournful rhyme
Of sore experience born and failures dire :
To books alone there comes the better time
That is the end of every sport’s desire.

KIDNEY TROUBLES.
It is not alone the aching back and the insipid
tired feeling that has to be borne; it is the con-
stant fear that greater ills will follow. Bright’s
disease, diabetes, gravel, gallstones, inflammation
of the bladder, suppression and retention of the
urine, etc., all result from diseases of the kidneys.
Those who have never been troubled know not the
misery and suffering which those afflicted undergo.
“I suffered very severely with kidney com-
plaint for a long period, ” writes Mrs. W. Cal laway,
14 Baldwin Street, Erskineville, near Sydney,
“and at last had to go to the Prince "Alfred
Hospital for treatment, but with the rnedicine
I took there, and prescribed for me in Other
ways, I found no relief. At times when doing
household duties, if occasion occurred that I
had to stoop. I could never get up without
assistance. I have been a martyr for years,
and the pains at times were dreadful. The
doctor stated that I had a slight attack of Bright’s
Disease, but, notwithstanding his treatment, I
could get no benefit. At last a friend recom-
mended me to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
and I have now taken some eighteen bottles and
found that they have' completely cured me.
Whenever I have a headache I have recourse to
them, and I find that by taking two or three they
drive the symptoms away. lam only too pleased
to give you this testimony, which you may use in
any way you wish.”*

The Old Soldier reviews an inexpen-
sive army
We have all had Switzerland held up to us as an
example for imitation. Its army only costs 3s. lid. per
head of the population, and the population is under
3,500,000, yet 200,000 drilled, disciplined, armed and
fully organised soldiers can be turned out for service in a
very few days, with 48 field batteries, each with six guns,
160 officers and men, and 120 horses. There is also an
arsenal always at work capable of turning out 16,000
artillery projectiles a week, and 100,000 infantry cart-
ridges a day. What is the real value of this very
cheap army for war? That is really the main point,
and it has been tried, and tried rather highly. Here is
an example
On Friday evening (July 15, 1870) President Dubs got
news that war between France and Germany had been
declared. In an hour the Federal Council had ordered
five divisions to be called out.
Saturday (16th) before noon the men of the Ist Division
were falling in before the Town Hall at Aarau. Early in
the afternoon they began to move off towards Basle, and
by midnight the firstdivision, 8296 strong, was in position
to cover the bridge of Basle.
By Tuesday the whole five divisions were complete, and
in the positions they were ordered to take up for the de-
fence of the country. They numbered 37,433 men and
3537 horses, with 11 batteries (66 field guns), and some of
the divisions had to march more than 100 miles in the
four days. Every battalion of infantry had its six
ammunition, baggage and provision waggons ready
packed at the regimental depot, with drivers and horses
in attendance as soon as it was known that the battalion
was called out.
The list of members’ attendances during
the last Federal session shows that Forrest, Glynn,
Groom, McDonald, Bamford, Ooon, Mathews,
Tudor, and Maloney did not miss a single sitting.
Joe Cook; Crouch, Frazer, Kelly, O’Malley and
Salmon were absent each one day ; Quick
was away two days; Deakin, Wise and
Palmer, three days ; Fuller, Hedges, Johnson,
Thomas and Wynne, four days; and Fisher,
Harper, Fowler, Mauger, Sampson, Spence and
John Thomson were otherwhere for five days
altogether. At the other end of the list, J. C.
Watson was away every day except three. Illness
caused the absence of Chapman for the whole
session, of Knox for 53 days, and of Bill Lyne for
41 days. Foxton only put in 25 appearances, but
wasn’t missed. The absences of Silly Brown
totalled 28 days; Livingston was away 32 days,
Bruce Smith 38 days, Ewing 42 days, and George
Reid 47 days. If Reid continues that record when
he gets to London as High Commissioner, he
should be found in his office at least once a month.

THE FLY PEST.
HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.
\/OU hear some recommend poisoned fly papers,
‘ some stick to the sticky papers, others even
say use Formalin; but the simplest and most
reliable means of all is
df
gd
fgd
With this powder you don’t have to invite the
fl.v to “ come into my parlor,” as the other remedies
require; you just sprinkle it where you know
Mr. Fly will go on the window sill, and at the foot
of the pane, or diffuse it in the air with the
INSECTIBANE blower.
All Chemists and Stores sell INSECTIBANE,
which, though so deadly to all forms of insect life,
including cockroaches, fleas, ants, beetles, aphis,
etc., is
HARMLESS TO MEN AND ANIMALS.
One small tin of INSECTIBANE will kill 1,000,000 flies.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Spring”: “San Remo” asserts (B. 2/!)/’0fl)
that “ the Commonwealth Commerce Act is fast becoming
a deceased letter.” His whole experience appears to
have been with the rag trade ; evidently he has not
bothered to study' the Act as a whole, and find out what it
is doing in a thousand other matters. For instance, the
wording on the labels of nearly all the brands of infants’
foods have been severely modified for the greater protec-
tion of tjie, little Australian ; the labels on headache
wafers have been"' radically altered ; hundreds of brands
of patent medicines have had extravagant claims deleted
from the screech that used to be pasted on the bottle or
wrapped round it; falsely stamped jewellery has been
dealt with; misleading remarks glued on drink
bottles have been wiped out; etc., etc. No ; the Com-
merce Act is not deceased. It is a vigorous .youth that
gives promise of an energetic manhood. Even in regard
to the correct marking of rags—the most difficult of its
functions—there has been a vast improvement, despite
“San Remo.” The present writer has personally
examined many cases Containing assorted apparel, and in
all instances about 75 per cent, of the contents have been
marked honestly and in accordance with the Commerce
regulations. They have been so marked only as a result
of the vigilance of Customs officers, who, by holding tip
previous consignments, have spread a knowledge of the
requirements of the Commerce Act amongst foreign
manufacturers and exporters. In the good old days only
about 5 per cent, would have been properly marked.
It would, however, be unfair to fine importers even now
for every breach of the Act. What is done is to make
them correctly re-mark the goods, and warn them that,
should further breaches occur, that particular exporter a
goods will be held up. Consequently the importers make
haste to warn the exporters concerned, and gradually
they tumble to the power of the Act. Still, certain Sbpfis
have been detained and forfeiture enforced. San
Remo ” is distinctly wrong, too, when be says that the
Briton is the worst brigand in his wretched rag trade.
The German is by far the worst. In this matter John
Bull is comparatively honest, though as German goods
are often marked in English letters, Bull gets a deal of
the blame which the other fellow ought to carry.
Ren mark, the S. Australian River Murray irri-
gation settlement, which spent 20 weary years in finding
out the things it shouldn’t try to grow if it wants to make
a living, and in planting the other things that it ought to
grow but didn’t try to at first, has just put upa local
record—one man netted £6OO for oranges from 12. acres.
For smaller patches there have been bigger yields per acre
—£SO from half an acre is the top notch —but this last is
the biggest orange cheque one man has yet pocketed.
Mildura, however, can still beat its down-the-river neigh-
bor : one man there has been for some years averaging
£lOO a year from an acre of lemons, and this season his
little patch nets £2OO. Without irrigation thislandis worth
about Jd. per acre per annum ; in fact, the State doesn t
average quite that much for most of its river country.

“R. 8.”: The Australian is an inventive chap,
but he can’t invent any protection to inventors. I know’
a mining engineer who, after inventing a slimes process,
has the satisfaction of seeing Americans use his in-
vention in his own country. His apparatus was for
extracting the water from “slum” so as to render it
amenable to treatment for recovery' of gold contents. He
patented it throughout the Australian States in 1902. A
fee was due to the Westralian patent-office; an agent
neglected to pay it, and the inventor, discovering the
omission in 1904, found alsp that his patent had been
cancelled. At least the patent-office should notify a
patentee direct before cancellation, as otherwise it is
open to a bribable agent to simply forget to pay
the fee. H. M. Justice, an eminent English patent
attorney, says that the negligence and fraud of patent
agents have made the new Patent Acts necessary, merely
in justice to the patentee, So far as Australia is con-
cerned all patents in force in 1901 at the date of the
creation of the Commonwealth should Vie made valid,
and not only those applied for since the establishment of
the Commonwealth Patents Office. At present on the
Yankee patent for the recovery of gold from slimes, Wes-
tralian mines treated 1,200,000 tons last year, and will
probably treat 2,000,000 tons next year. On this they are
paying a royalty of 6d. a ton ; but the real inventor is
getting nothing. The quantity treated last year by the
process was 7,000,000 tons for all the world ; and the
invention has done much in the revival of mining in
Mexico. It is called sometimes Butters’ process and
sometimes Moore’s process; but it is the process
of Askin Nicholas. Six Commonwealth patents have
been granted over the original State patents. All
the Patent Office does is to take fees, leaving the
first inventor to fight his claims, instead of examining
specifications and firing out flagrant infringements. If
any man wants to invest in a patent, let him, in the
present state of the law, invest in the piracy of it ; to buy’
the original patent means mostly that he is buying a law
suit. A patent should protect ;in Australia it doesn’t.
Further no renewal fees should be charged. The present
Commonwealth Government gives no satisfaction. The
High Court of Australia has decided that Potter was the
true inventor of the acid-flotation sulphide process, but
that doesn’t do Potter proud. Potter’s dead.
“ Marloo ” : “ Ya rr u m-’m enti o n s the Jamberoo
Mountains as a likely spot to find the illicit grog-machine.
He may be correct ; but, during the last six years I have
made acquaintance with eight of the worms, and only one
of them was among, the hills. The other seven were run in
connection with farms. I recently witnessed the un-
earthing of two from below the flooring of houses which
were under repair. Another deserted machine reposes in a
brick chimney which remained standing after afire. The
greatest difficulty in the business is not the hiding of the
still, but the disposal of the product. One operator, who
was a milk vendor, supplied his chain-lightning to the
pubs for two years without detection. At the end of that
time he bought a pub for himself. Another delivered his
firewater along with eggs and farm produce, and to
further disarm suspicion he banged the Salv’army drum.
“ CLO’—OLD CLO’!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The British import of rags for shoddy is steadily in-
creasing.—News item.
When Jacob battled for a crust
With Gentile greed and Gentile lust,
What magic word supported him
Through all his woe ?
What mascot kept his courage up,
And bade him, smiling, drain the cup?
What word of might uplifted him
When Gentile fury shifted him ?
’Twas but the song he sent along
Of “Clo’-Old Clo’.”
When British mobs in days of old
Would strip the Hebrew of his gold,
And give his roof to fire and flame
And work him woe ;
When Deutscher fury burnt him out,
When Russians, in a bigot rout,
Would harry him from house and home,
And drive him frantic o’er the foam,
His wand’ring plaint was still the quaint
One ; “Clo’—Old Clo’! ”
And now, when Bull is on the wane,
And Stunnn and Stein his markets gain,
He gazeth round him anxiously
At times, I trow ;
Above the streams of Babylon
He hangs his harp, doth weary John,
Till, minding Jacob’s olden strain,
He bids his men take heart again :
For still there’s hope and life and scope
In “Clo—Old Clo!”
And Yidsof high and low degree
Do gaze on John admiringly
And hail him as a kinsman dear,
Though one-time foe ;
The Wizard of the Rags is he,
And, like the Jews of ancientry,
His bales of scraps from everywhere
He turns to profit, fresh and fair,
And findeth pelf to keep himself
In “ Clo—Old Clo ! ”

PIANOS
THE, BEST—
The best instrumental accompaniment to the human voice is the Piano, and the best
Piano for accompaniment work is the BEALE PATENT, because of the splendid singing
quality of its tone, which sustains the voice and enables the singer to vocalise with ease and
power. Tonal quality is the most essential quality of a good instrument,',and it was for “tonal
quality and general excellence” that the Grand Jury of the Franco-British Exhibition, held in
London last year, bestowed the highest award in its power upon the Beale Pianos, viz., The
GRAND PRIX. The jury was composed of three French and two British musical experts,
artists thoroughly qualified to adjudicate upon such a question, and their judgment endorses
the testimony of thousands of clients throughout Australia to whom we have supplied Pianos.
There are over 12,000 Beale Pianos in use, and our extensive works at Annandale—now being
greatly enlarged—are kept busy turning Pianos out at the rate of three every four hours.
These facts are significant of the high regard in which the Beale Pianos are held, more than
three times as many of them as of any other makers being sold annually in Australia.
Besides the highest award for “tonal quality and general excellence,” our Pianos were
also awarded the Diploma of Honor for iron and steel work, specially relating to the Patent
Metal Wrest-plank and Steel Tuning System, which is used exclusively in our Pianos, and
makes them absolutely the most durable instruments that are made anywhere; a Gold Medal
for excellence of Cabinet Work, which guarantees a very handsome piece of furniture as the
housing of a first-class musical instrument; and a Gold Medal for perfection of the
organisation for their manufacture. You cannot get better Pianos than the BEALE. Let us
send you our fine Catalogue, showing them in their natural colors; or, if convenient, kindly
call at our Showrooms to inspect and try them.

“Australia’s Amphibians.”
WITH the summer comes the call of the
surf —and The Lone Hand Surfing
Number. The sudden development of Surf
Bathing on the littoral of this continent is
evolving for us a new type of Australian—the
expert muscular surf-shooter, and the brown girl of the beaches. Of
the sport of surf-shooting, Egbert T. Russell, himself an expert, writes
enthusiastically ; while for months past The Lone Hand photographers
have been haunting the breakers to-catch the surf-shooter in flight and
the Brown Girl in all her youthful vigor and grace. To look on
these photographs will be almost as refreshing as a bathe in the surf.
We give a few reduced photographs here as an evidence of good faith.
fg
1 The Christmas N UMBER ofT he Lone Hand might almost
be called a Girl number. The frontispiece, in color, by Percy
F. S. Spence, shows the Yachting Girl ; while J. J. Hilder has
a brilliant piece of color impressionism, called “ I he Brown
Girl of the Beaches.” And no less than eight Australian
artists depict in full-page illustrations their various conceptions
of The Australian Girl.

The Queensland Bible-in-Sfcafce-Sdhools
Referendum Act has experienced some Strange
mutations. The referendum was to be taken at
the next Federal election, but as Deakin didn’t
want the Commonwealth contest to descend into
a sectarian shindy he objected, saying that it was
a State matter, and should take place at a State
election. Consequently, the Government is now
arranging to take the vote next June, when there
will be neither State nor Federal election, and
when the only people who will roll up to suffrage
on the matter will be a few thousand fanatics.

The Never-Never.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEYOND the furthest track, the final station;
Beyond the desert sands of desolation,
On an eternal tramp
Beyond the fires of sundowner and drover
At their last camping ground—men still discover
A stage beyond this camp.
Past healing springs, past fevered lignum swamp.
And past the mulga’s weird and blood wood’s pomp,
With blood afire men wander
Froifi golden gullies where the bower-birds sang.
And far from whiz of Myall’s boomerang
To an eternal Yonder.
Back o’ the sunset, there the sky so still is,
No mail regrets Love’s passionate red lilies
'That flush Life’s lone lagoon ;
There is an end of mortal deed& and dreams,
And this illusion of the world that seems.
Beneath the sun and moon.
Beyond the sunset, newer stars and splendid,
Or none, may rise ; the weary road is ended :
Ended the soul’s endeavor.
The wonder-thirst, desire for Day’s hot light—
And men find rest, when brooding wings of Night
Enfold the Never-Never.

Beer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
are three pubs in the township,
| but the Royal is reckoned the best place to
put up at. It is a wooden, one-storeyed
shell of a place, and it is very dirty. The rooms
are divided by partitions and have no ceilings.
Above is the galvanised iron roof and the rafters
decorated with black cobwebs. There are two
stools on the verandah, one on each side of the
bar-door, and a disreputable canvas chair lies in
wait for the unwary at the verandah end.
The street outside turns into a mudpool when it
rains, and a good deal of the stuff is carried inside
on to the floors. The hotelkeeper’s wife and two
servants wrestle in a heart-broken way with the
chronic dirt and disorder of the place. The atmo-
sphere seems to stagger under the heavy smell of
molasses from the neighboring sugar mill.
The bedrooms and the dining-room are regarded
as mere compulsory adjuncts to the bar. The
meals are thrown on the table at nlore-or-less
fixed hours, and eaten principally from the end
of the knife. Most of the food is tinned—tinned
meat, tinned milk, tinned potatoes, tinned jam,
tinned fish. The back yard is strewn with empty
tins from all over the world—from America, from
Germany, from Switzerland, from France. The
district grows nothing but sugar, but it grows
that up to the very back doors.
The landlord is a great burly fellow with hairy
arms and heavy eyebrows. He spends 'all his
time in the bar encouraging business. The cus-
tomers shout for him as a matter of dutv. If they
don’t, he joins in the shout all the same. When
he is particularly gracious he says : “ I don’t mind
if I have-one with yous meself,” and he fills him-
self out one accordingly, and charges it in. No
one ever raises a protest. Now and then he gets
the horrors, and then the servants and the
boarders and the customers, and the wife and the
children escape into the street while he beats the
walls and talks violence to the wood-heap. Mean-
while the policeman stands among the group out
in the middle of the road, and lets him “ git
over it.”
A number of “hums” sit out on the verandah
all day, with their bleary eyes blinking at' the
landscape. At night, after the bar closes, they
lie down and sleep. When meal-times come they
try to rush the table ; but the girl who “ waits ”
says : “ ’Ere, you clear outer this ! ” Whereupon
the “hum” picks, his hat up off the floor and
mooches out. If he starts to argue the point she
calls out to “ the boss.” And the argument breaks
off suddenly.
Each pub has its own “hums.” The dozen orso
at the Royal include a “traveller.” He is a
young man of about 30, of good address appar-
ently. He arrived a fortnight since, found
business bad, tasted the local stingo and lay
down to it. Now he goes about without boots or
a hat, and when he sees people walking towards
the he waylays them, and says hoarsely:
“For God’s sake, shout me a drink, mates!”
Another hum is a short, podgy, fair-headed
foreigner, of uncertain, nationality’with, a mon-
strous neck. He follows a group into the bar,
pushes himself up on the outside quietlv, and
remarks, “Mine’s a beer, Boss.” The landlord
generally replies, “ Giterellouderdjs.”; A third is
a young fellow who unexpectedlv inherited
£II,OOO down south, and went through it in six
months. He is a painter by trade, and has been
trying to do a job for the publican for Weeks past,
But his hand shakes too much, and the siren call
of the bar prevents artistic concentration.
Ihe grog is powerful. A cane,-cutter came in
from an outside farm, drank two Jong beers, and
fell down in a fit in the bar. At one end of the
verandah there is “ the hospital.” When a cus-
tomer has drunk himself intri insensibility- he is
thrown into it. On pay nights “ the hospital” is
a snoring heap of victims. As they become sober,
they sort themselves out from the mass and get
into the air.
The hotel has a billiard-table. , It is a small
affair, three feet by six. Where it has been torn,
the landlady has sewn in pieces of tweed and
moleskin, and ironed them down. The cues are
tipped with umbrella ferrules, arid there is no word
in the language that can describe the shape of
the discolored balls. The table is full of ridges
and hollows, and the balls have eccentric actions
with which the skilled local player has an intimate
knowledge. The table is not licensed, but the
loser of a game shouts for the winner, and, as a
matter of courtesy, for the volunteer marker also.
The Beer is brought up from the wharf by the
sugar-mill tram-line. Once the mill manager had
much trouble through Beer interfering with his
men. He declared war on Beer, and announced
that the tram would carry no more of it. It could
not be got up by other means, and the annual
race-meeting was about to be held. Intense
excitement prevailed. A public meeting was
held and indignant pro-Beer resolutions unani-
mously carried. Deputations waited on the mill
manager; urgent wires chased each other to the
seat of government; and all local business was
paralysed. A stranger who publicly remarked
“ Damgoojob” was assaulted violently.
In the end, through the exertions of the publi-
cans and the strong representations made through
their union, and through its ally, the Brewers’
Association, and through powerful leading articles
in the local paper with which all the pubs adver-
tised, the tramway took on the stuff again, and
the ghastly Beer famine was averted.

“ F.B.”: The old tendency—the tendency
which gave birth to the Northern Separation
movements years ago—to concentrate everything
in the south of Queensland is now going as strong
as ever. The new University and the Central
Technical College are to be located in Brisbane.
of the projected railway extensions
are in the South, and 75 per' cent, of the immi-
grants are dumped into Southern Queensland.
Moreover, the approaching Redistribution of
Seats Bill will throw more political power than
ever into the part of the State dominated by
Brisbane. By the way, both Philp and Kidston
came into Parliament as staunch advocates of Sepa-
ration for Northern and Central Queensland, but
the Brisbane blight settled on them many a year
ago.
“S.R.” ; The Wages Board Act of Queens-
land provides a clause for the aged, slow or infirm
TIME-PAYMENT TROUBLES,,
"Sold a clock, did yer? But what’s happened to yr face ? ”
“I called yesterday for the,first instalments
worker, and it is being used in some cases as a
lever to keep down wages. The Act allows, >a
proportion of one backward struggler f-p-'five
ordinary workers, and Mr. James Cjjbc'o is doing
his darnedest to make use of. the.eOiicession. Ever
since the drapery trade awaracame out there has
been a rush of young fellows to get permits to
accept a lower rate of wage than.the standard, on
the ground that they are slow. Of late the
drapery trade hereabouts has been overrun with
under-paid juniors ; and when one of them gets a
hint from his boss that he had better see about a
permit, he seizes his hat, rushes round to the
Board and states that he is a perfect snail. To
the Board’s credit be it said, it has mostly
sat down hard on such applications. The
usual course taken is to ask the abject appli-
cant what his sales average has been ; but
the employers’ representatives are up in arms
against this perfectly legitimate line of investiga-
tion ; they assert it is one of the coal-black secrets
of Commerce. But how on earth can the Board
decide if it cannot get information re the amount of
work a salesman does? Of course, the- sales-beok
is not an absolute guide as to a salesman’s worth ;
the plodding salesman with a low average may be
a better stock-keeper than the smart; nailer of
customers; but, on the whole, the saless-book is a
pretty good indicator. Some strange things came
to light in Sydney in connection with the Slow
Workers’ Clause. One young fellow, from one of
the largest stores, asked for a permit. The
Registrar called for evidence as to his takings,
and found that he had a weekly average of £80
cash sales ! Now it is pretty safe to bet that £20
of that £80 was clear profit—all raked in bv one
45s. salesman. The young man did not get his
permit to work for specially low wages.
Premier Kidston’s political position is,
apparently, lapsing again into precariousness.
Last waek saw Philp, Forrest, Macartney and
Keogh all voting against the Government, and
even defeating it on the vital clause of an im-
portant measure. Perhaps this accounts for the
wild haste with which the Coalition is rushing into
recess again.
There is more trouble in the ranks of the
stormy Queensland Labor party, an excitable
body which has got to loggerheads with almost, if
not quite, every leader it ever had save the pre-
sent one (whose turn hasn’t come yet) and the one
who is dead. This time it is .Toe Lesina who goes
out. After being the stalwart and the advance-
guard and the torch-bearer of the party for 10J
years, a vote of censure was passed on Joseph,
and in great anger he packed up his political
spare shirt and collar, and shifted to a place
among the Independent Oppositionists. It is an
unfortunate fact that the Queensland Labor party
has more internal shindies than all the other
Australian Labor parties put together, and
the publicity of them is something lamentable.
Over and over again office has seemed to be
almost within its reach, and then there have arisen
fuss and recrimination and hen-cackling; and
when the dust and feathers cleared away a
diminished party has been seen scooting along
once more a good mile behind the ’bus. Even in
Federal politics the same trouble appears; the
only serious split in the Federal Labor party took
place when an angry Queensland Laborite (or ex-
Laborite) insisted on running as an extra candi-
date, and three Senatorial seats were delivered
into the hands of the enemy. The Bulletin pro-
poses that a committee of three (say, a demo-
cratic parson, adoctor and an oil merchant —the last
is suggested because the machine seems to require
lubrication) be appointed to inquire into the why-
ness of the trouble. It isn’t owing to climate ;if
the heat caused ill-temper and fury, then Queens-
land would be a notoriously criminal land,
whereas its record is exceedingly good. It isn't
owing to Queensland rum, for Labor politicians
are in the main an intensely sober crowd, and
could safely be left amid tanks of rum. And the
honesty of" the bulk of the party is beyond
suspicion. Yet it must be owing to something.
The country south of the Gulf will take
a lot of opening up, and engineer Phillips was
lately commissioned to report on the best way of
making a start. His scheme capsizes those which
have been hatched by politicians who sit in Par-
liament House and look at a map with their minds
made up beforehand that of course the traffic
must come south. Instead of Camooweal, with
the Barclay tableland just behind in the Northern
Territory, being linked with Cloncurry, Phillips
says it would be preferable to join it with the
Albert River. This would mean 245 miles haul-'
age, instead of 700 to Townsville. He favors
a line from Cloncurry to Burketown, and
thence to the Albert River. It would skirt the
eastern edge of the mineral belt for 100 miles and
pass within 20 miles of Mount Cuthbert and
other groups of mines, besides traversing the
irrigable area of the Gregory and other streams,
and materially shorten the distance to connect
the Lawn Hills mines. He also advises that a
line be built from Gregory Downs, via the Burke-
town-Camooweal road, to Camooweal. It would
pass within 40 miles of the Mount Oxide mine.
Several feeders to these lines are suggested. The
cost of doing these things—say two millions—
would amount to Is. 9d. per acre of the classified
area. Kidston is strongly in favor of linking the
Gulf hinterland with one of the ports; but with «
Philp behind Kidston and Townsville behind
Philp, the Premier doesn’t enthusiastically em-
brace the idea of taking the traffic north.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. December 18, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The heat it groweth hotter every day, and the
only person who remains unmoved is Wee Mac-
gregor, in the white clothes of a laundered life ;
but then he has so trumpeted his love of the
tropics that he could not say a word now, even if
he were boiled. His spouse, however, melts
gently but visibly; “the vision,” in collarless
garb and the biggest hat she can muster, has con-
tracted a perpetual motion of the fan-arm, and
the Scarlett aide is becoming a soft brick-red.
They’ve been having a let-up from engagements
these last few days, but the Mighty Atom will
open a fire brigade this afternoon —1 suspect he
has a private arrangement for a hose-down upon
the quiet afterwards.
The combined heat of the weather and of the
debates has been too much for part of the local
Assembly. During a sitting which lasted from
Thursday afternoon until nearly noon on Friday,
one legislator on the Government side, after trying
to howl down chairman Armstrong 'and deputy
Tolmie, came near to being put out. Ultimately
he collapsed from exhaustion, but, breaking subse-
quently into howls and groans, he was forcibly
led out of the chamber to the billiard room, where
his voice was uplifted in loud plaint. Two other
custodians of the country were more or less
affected, and in one case matters nearly came to
fists. Bishop Barnes, however, came in as the
gentle peacemaker—and nearly got plugged for
his pains. . - |
Another peacemaker has discovered that virtue
is its own and only reward. The story is long
and complicated, but briefly it deals with a pretty
lady in a seaside villa and another of that terrible
fraternity, the boarder. The pair are said to
have disturbed the early beauty sleep of the vir-
tuous man by murmuring nothings outside his
window ; whereupon he arose in his wrath and his
pyjamas, and went to the husband who was afar
off, and told him of the goings on. Then the hus-
band also arose—arose and smote the tale-bearer
hard ; so the disturbed person is more disturbed
than ever. The wife wears an injured expression,
and the boarder bolted with his breakfast in his
pocket.
The Lawless family has come back—that is,
the mother has. She walked the plank of the
Otway on Thursday. Among the flotsam and
jetsam of this (her seventh) trip are some art
studies collected in Naples. A cigarette-smoking
boy’s head is the daddy of the collection, and a
fine piece of student work it is. The coppery
skin, the pursed mouth, the contracted brows are
excellent, and the figure literally leans out of the
picture. Naples is, from all accounts, the same
dirty muddle ; but dirt seems to breed painters, or
else painters are poor and go where they can
avoid the water and sewerage rate.
Among those who have “ crept silently to rest ”
are Judge Paul and Major George Gross. The
old Judge, one of the wittiest and most popular
men of his day here, was a renowned raconteur,
and his club stories kept the Johnsonian from
stagnation. Another complete set he had for
drawing-room use; so both men and women
gatherings will be the poorer for his going. The
bee in his wig was a love of Japanese aft; he even
imported two Jap carpenters to put together an
imported Jap house for him in New Farm. The
roof looked as if it leaked, but perhaps it didn’t.
It is said that when the affair was finished,
the Judge asked his foreman if he thought
he could erect an Australian residence, and
received the reply, “I could build a box.” Old
Paul was a warm admirer of Miss Beatrice Day,
whom he declared the best comedy actress he had
ever seen. From an acknowledged critic this was
praise worth having; and, to back it up. he was
rarely absent .from the front row of the stalls
when she was to be seen in one of her really good
characters. Paul was an ornament to the District
Court Bench for over 38 years.
Major George Gross, who for something like 23
years knocked learning into Brisbane Grammar
School boys, was a soldier and a gentleman ; and
the State is the poorer for his passing. Reggie
Roe, under whose head-mastership he toiled, says
of him that he was the most resourceful man he
ever met. A native of Switzerland, he was just
the kind of Swiss Guard that would have been a
comfort alongside of you in the bad old days, and
you would have armed him with a battle-axe. A
year ago his throat became affected ; he went
south for advice, and heard his death sentence in-
stead. Then the real heroism of the man came!
to the front, and through the long days of waiting;
he was calm, uncomplaining and unselfish.
The Brisbane Town Council is upon the war-
path again. The row, boiled down, is simply that,
one disappointed section proposes to get out an.
injunction against the laying of the stone of the-
new (Town Hall by his Ex. somewhere before the
end of the present year. The Mayor, however, is.
a man of determination, and declares that he is-
going straight ahead'unless the police and the-
military hold him back and sit on his chest. The
several malcontents are, of course, backed up by
their several wards, because every ward wants the-
Town Hall in its own backyard. But why the-
ratepayers don’t rise in a body and call upon the
council to stop wrangling, and pay the dustman’s
wages, and do other sensible pieces of legitimate
business, Heaven alone knows.
It has transpired that Antarctic David has been
approached on the matter of the Chancellorship
of Queensland’s new University. Penguin-like,
he is sitting on the ice considering the matter.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.


WHAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN DO.
Local self-help in Queensland is aided by splendid
Local Authorities Acts, which constitute a
code of local government law equal to any in the
j,
wo ™.
Some of the local authorities carry on their work
T «■*••»■**•-*-*
as large as Switzerland or Denmark,
The local authorities are charged to assist the cen-
«»dcdopmMai rT *
as the provision of artesian bores, the bettering
of communication by bridges, canals, hood-
gates, locks, water supply, wells, etc.
The local authorities may own and manage com-
munal services, such as the supply of gas, water,
electricity; may provide ferries, quarries,
abattoirs, tramways, sale-yards, public baths,
museums, schools of art, picture galleries,
bands and orchestras, parks, statues, monu-
ments, fountains, etc.
The local authority may be the medium: for the
distribution of grain, plants, roots, seeds, etc.,
to farmers and settlers.
The council’s jurisdiction over public health has
led to the lowering of the death-rate below that
of any European or American rate; and
child-life is especially favored through this
cause, assisted by the glorious climate.

SELF-HELP IN QUEENSLAND.
BY J. D. FITZ GERALD, BARRISTER-AT-LAW.
As already remarked in a former article, one of
the best methods of j udging of the capacity and the
independence of a community lies in ascertaining
the state of its system of local government. Of
no part of its governmental code has Queens-
land more reason to be proud than of its
laws relating to that important part of the
domestic life of a State, and in the flourishing con-
dition of its local self-government.
It must be remembered, too, that the system of
local government which prevails in Queensland is
probably unique and unparalleled anywhere else
outside of Australia. Usually, local government
FAT STOCK FROM MOUNT BRISBANE (Q.), ON THE ROAD TO SALE-YARDS.
DIPPING SHEEP AT JONDARYAN STATION , WEST QUEENSLAND.
is supposed to apply to the complex problems of
urban and city conditions. In Queensland the
system is adjustable not only to the most complex
conditions of urban life, but also to the conditions
of the sparser settlement in the huge back-block
territory of the great Northern State. The local-
government law of Queensland is a practical code,
which contains powers that may be called into life
at the will of the people of any community in
Queensland, even the most remote. Thus we
have in Queensland areas under government of a
divisional board or shire council which are larger
in extent than Belgium, and nearly as large as
Switzerland or Denmark.
The student of political economy would pro-
bably not expect to find that in a new State, like
Queensland, devoting itself sedulously to the
development of its primitive industries, much
attention had been given to the subject of local
government; but, curiously enough, Queensland
lias been the leader of the Australian States in
the provision of an almost perfect system for its
people. Under this system not only can the roads
and the internal communication in the vast .in-
terior be provided for, but also scope is allowed
for the introduction of those civic amenities which
are the result of the co-operative life of great
cities.
Thus the local authority may take upon itself
the charge of roads, bridges, ferries, wharves and
rs^e 6 i£“ SPSsfirss:
technical schools, mechanics or youths’ institu-
tions, museums and public libraries. It may con-
hands they may have been. Then the local
authority many acquire lands and buildings to use
as pleasure grounds, gardens, libraries, museums,

music halls and gymnasiums ; and it may furnish
any building which it acquires or builds with
books, musical instruments and works of nature
or art.
It has been said that the Queensland legislators
wOre the pioneers in the sphere of modern and
scientific principles as applied to local govern-
ment. It would perhaps be too much to say that
the Local Authorities Act is a perfect me.asure ;
but it can be said that at the time the principles
of (local government were first embodied in statu-
tory form in Queensland, no other statute in Aus-
tralia or Maoriland could compare with it for
scientific draughtsmanship, fOr conciseness of
arrangement, for attention to the important mat-
ters of finance, nor for the extent of powers which
were placed at the disposal of the independent
local authorities.
It is in the institution of local government
that the intending emigrant from the United
Kingdom will find that the genius of the race has
been followed. Thus the general outlines of the
local-government system—which is as old as.
English history—have been copied from those of
Great Britain. We know that immense strides
have been taken in respect to local-government
law since Lord John Russell’s statutes in the
’thirties. England, with its tremendous aggrega-
tion of people in the cities, has had to face the
acuter problems of city government, and has
faced and solved them in such a manner as to
earn the approval of the Continental peoples and
those of the United States. Thus we find,
especially in the United States, a continuous copy-
ing of the methods of the great city governments
of England, Ireland and Scotland. Distinguished
publicists from the United States—Professor
Albert Shaw and Professor Howe are notable
examples—have spent their time studying the
mar vellous strides which the English self-governing
municipal and county councilshave madein thenew
science of civic government. The principles
which have come down from the centuries, from
the Saxon times, were carried with the pioneers
who came to develop the magnificent territory of
Queensland, as the sacred hearth fire was carried
by the Greek colonists.
But although, the model was followed by the
pioneers in their early legislation upon local
government, a new spirit was infused into the
methods of carrying out the work. This was
doubtless forced upon the pioneers by the peculiar
problems of the early settlers, But they were apt
in taking the initiative. It consists in a greater
independence of the local bodies; so that in all
things that are essential to the local work of the
cities and the interior, the local authorities are
supreme within their own well-defined sphere,
The result of this has also been a greater energy
and activity in the local authorities. The men
who have the responsibility imposed upon them
have risen to their opportunities and proved that,
even in the sphere in which the main British
stocks have set the world an example, their Aus-
tralian offshoots, under favorable conditions, are
able to give impulse to one of the most useful of
the systems whereby men may govern themselves,
It may be as well to note here that the special
circumstances of the State have been provided for
in connection with the work of the local authori-
ties. Apart from the purposes which have already
been mentioned, a smaller group of powers may
be considered here as showing how our local
government has been adjusted by Parliament to
suit the conditions of internal developments,
Power is given to the civic bodies to invest their
funds in the supply of artesian bores ; in building
bridges, canals, dams, flood-gates, locks, public
pumps, quays; in starting experimental farms,
quarries, reservoirs, sewerage works, septic tanks,
slaughter houses, weirs, wells, and so on. Many
of the towns in the interior have availed them-
selves of the magnificent supply of artesian water
which has been discovered and exploited in
Queensland of recent years. • It may be seen by
the above list that the powers enumerated com-
prise all those necessary for the enhancement of
the natural wealth of the localities and for the
conquest of the few natural defects and impedi-
ments which the people are slowly but surely
overcoming. Thus the councils, especially in the
remote districts, are able to lend the most valuable
aid: in removing all impediments which may be
imposed by the aridity of the climate upon the
developments of the vast sources of natural
wealth.
But, in addition to this, provision is made,
where settlement has advanced and urban con-
ditions have become highly developed, for the
ownership and management by the councils of
whjtt are called “the communal services,” or
those services which are in the nature of monopo-
lies. Thus the councils may invest their funds in,
or use their credit in, establishing gas works,
■hydraulic works, river or harbor ferries, quarries
for the supply of their own material for road
making,’:' slaughter houses, sewerage systems,
water works and electricity works, and so on.
Again, under special sections of the Act, the local
authority may establish tramways; and a system
is in operation by which the question of entering
upon' such a work may be put to the ratepayers,
who must give their authority before the work is
undertaken. : Upon, the acceptance of the tram-
way scheme, the local authority may raise the
necessary funds for the carrying out of the scheme*
and may also impose special rates upon the rate-
payers of the areas which come within the zone of
.betterment. Strict rules were laid down for the
keeping of accounts, in order that the communal
enterprise may be carried on on a strictly com-
mercial basis. This rule of applying business
principles in the conduct of a communal enter-
prise and the prevention of the intrusion of alder-
manic or other influences in the working of the
service was hammered in by Mr. Kidston, the
Premier of Queensland, at the opening of the
Rockhampton tramway system in June of this
year.
Then for the more populous urban areas another
set of communal activities may be employed, such
as the establishment of public baths, the provision
and maintenance of cemeteries and crematories,
gymnasiums, libraries, museums, and buildings
for public meetings; of public music, such as
bands and orchestras; of recreation grounds. In
cities the councils can establish public wash-
houses in the thickly populated residential areas,
Then again, not only the construction and main-
tenance of the wonderful network of roads
throughout the State is in the hands of the local
authorities, but also the control of order and a
good system upon those roads is retained » the
hands of the officers of the local councils. Thus
the question of impounding straying stock is in
the hands of the council, the question of opening
or closing roads in shires or in towns, the question
of gates giving access through the huge pastures
in the interior, the question of trees or posts on
the roads, and provision for the maintenance of
access roads, the prevention of accidents, the
safety of vehicular and foot-passenger traffic, of
fencing in the interests of public safety—all these
are in the hands of the local authorities.
Again we find a power which will not usually
be found in a Local Government statute, which
allows the local authority to erect and maintain a
statue or monument, or cause fountains, in the
interest of public health and convenience, to be
constructed and maintained. The co-operative
life of the community may be brightened at the
expense of the whole area by the expenditure of
money upon demonstrations, illuminations or
entertainments; but, of course, subject to a
wholesome rule that only a certain percentage of
the general rates shall be used for that purpose.
A further mark of the specialisation of these
councils is to be found in the fact that the local
authority, at the request of the Minister, may
undertake to supply and distribute amongst the
owners and occupiers of land, within its area, any
plants, roots, grain, or seeds at the disposal of
the Minister, for cultivation, propagation or such
purposes, and may guarantee the payment of
moneys received for such distribution.
The councils also have charge of the extirpation
and destruction of noxious weeds or plants. This
is a curious development of specialised power,
which is the result of and tribute to the extreme
fecundity of the soil and climate of Queensland,
where it is known that certain shrubs and even
flowers, such as the water hyacinth, have developed
with such prolific activity that in a few months a
whole water-course may be choked. Power is ■
given to the Queensland councils to deal with
such matters with promptitude. Then the
councils have large powers to deal with dangerous
and neglected structures, and may demolish
buildings which are not considered safe, or which
might be injurious to public health.
That most important subject, the care of public
health, is generally administered by the councils ;
and that their administration is active and
successful may be inferred from the fact that the
death rate in Queensland is lower than that of any
other State in the world except Maoriland and
South Australia, and that the expectation of life
for children in the .perilous first year of existence
is greater in Queensland than anywhere else in the
world except Maoriland and South Australia,
Enough has been said to show that the system
provided by Parliament for dealing with the most
vitally important branch of administration of
local government is as up-to-date as any system
in the world. It is clear that it is admirably
adapted to the peculiar needs of the vast areas
and the sparse populations of Queensland. It is
adjustable to the peculiar local conditions, and it
is elastic enough to meet all the requirements
both of the thickly populated and urban areas as
well as the comparatively empty spaces of the
North and West. It is based upon principles
which the European emigrant will find familiar,
These principles have been extended and, applied
to problems which have not arisen in the Old
World; but there is nothing startling or un-
reasonable in the development of an pld system
upon new lines and applied to a new and rich
territory.

The Inky Way.
“ J.G.” : According to The Bulletin (11/11/’O9), Johnny
Thomas, sole survivor of the Ballarat district gold dis-
coveries, is now drawing an old-age pension. The last
time I saw old John was when he was the proprietor of a
newspaper called the Buninyong Telegraph, about the
oldest-established rag in the Ballarat district. But there
couldn’t have been too much profit obtainable from it,
especially of late years. The Telegraph was established,
if I mistake not, some time in the early ’so’s by Sam
Goode, who got hold of a few boxes of type out of a cheap
sale in Chaos, and a lumbering, back-killing hand-press
(very likely an heirloom handed down from Caxtoh) ; arid
so the paper was started to shake things upon the Bunin-
yong goldfield. Old Goode was mighty proud of his local
thunderer, but scoffing diggers called it the local blun-
derer, to its owner’s huge chagrin. It Used to be a great
joke to beguile Sam Goode into a pub or somewhere, and
get somebody who had been a compositor and could
decipher type upside down, to pull out the Telegraph
and read something interesting to the party, holding the
paper wrong end up. Then somebody would call the
reader’s attention to the manner in which he was holding
the document, and he would say that was the only way
he could read the damn thing. Buninyong began to
waste away as the gold got played out, and the circula-
tion and influence of the Telegraph waned considerably.
It was a mere breath or shadow of its former self
when John Thomas bought it off Goode close on a quarter
century ago. I put in a spell in the old Telegraph office
as devil, and used to run the ink roller over the type
every time it came back from under the press, and after a
profane person had snatched a printed paper off. When
I had dabbed a roller, which I then thought weighed
about two tons, over the type, a clean sheet of paper
would be clapped on, and another swearing man would
pull the lever with a groan, and send the type back under
the old press to print another copy. It was heavy graft,
but the paper staggered out somehow.

“A Croweater M.D.” drops a line from, Salina Cruz,
Mexico:—“Travelling through a little native village
situated off the Tehuantepee railroad, which connects the
Atlantic and Pacific, I called at the local hotel for a cool
beer. I rested awhile, then asked for a bottle to put in
my bag. Imagine my surprise when I found that the
senora had wrapped it in an old Bulletin cover. How I
devoured the Red Page, even the sheep-shearing machine
ads. were delightful literature. It is two years since I
had read any home papers; and this red cover, found in
almost the last place where I would look for it, makes the
longing for the gum-leaves come back to me. Heaven
knows when this will reach you ; but here I drink to you
and to Australia—luck and a happy Christmas ! It ought
to reach you in time for that! ”

The fight between Wellington Times and the new
Dominion, of Maoriland, isn’t easing off at all. Ward and
his Government stick to the Times, and the Dominion puts
up the Opposition to ask awkward questions about the
Times’ ownership. At latest the Times had resurrected
the American idea of running a “voting contest.” The
first prize is a trip to Jerusalem, Chicago and other
places, arid the man wins it who gets most votes ; and you
can give yourself or anybody else as many as 10,000 votes
if you pay up a five-years’ subscription. Up to now the
Dominion hasn’t invented a louder shout, but there’s a
big premium waiting in the office for the man who has a
knock-out scheme concealed about him.

It is a healthy sign that the elections of officers of the
N.S.W. Institute of Journalists were fought, and a com-
paratively strong team was picked for 1910. The Institute
has cut its first teeth, and a number of people are anxious
to see the teeth experimented with. “ What’s the Insti-
tute doing? ” growl 111-paid and Over-worked? “Isn’t it
going to be anything but a billiard alley and a card joint?
What’s the matter with asking the proprietors a few ques-
tions occasionally? ” All of which is fine and large ; but
the teeth that have been cut are only milk teeth, and won’t
chew tough steak, to say nothing of tough proprietor. Still
it won’t be long before the Institute will have to stand
■ on its hind legs like a grown man, or go along to the dead-
house. As a social club solely it cannot exist; only a
very few members are interested in it from that point of
view. It apparently cannot yet be a trades union, owing
to the split opinion on that point. So it must be
a lever that will have to be used with 901 b. of tact and
101 b. of punch power. And in order to exert even 101 b.
of punch power, it must get a paid secretary. A staff-man
secretary can’t afford to risk being made a warning and
an example by a Fat Proprietor or a Swelled Manager.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ve heart! them all day in my fancy, and heard them all
nighfcp my dreams—
The voicelof the breeze on the mountains, the murmur of
wandering streams.
They were borne with a zephyr-like motion, they have
come on the wings of unrest, —
The voice of the far-away Bushland, the call of ; ly

And through the long mazes of distance, the sun and the

The calling has come till I’ve heeded—l’m going out

All day at my window I’m watching the people go hurry-

Their faces have made me unhappy, they haunt me—and
will till I die.
Ah, me, were I master of magic I’d grant those poor
mortals release
Prom the wear and the woes of the city, and give them
ineffable peace.
But I wake from my musings (how foolish, how hopeless,
how helpless, how vain !),
Yet I know I shall never forget them when deep in the

The ’writer is racing and clicking a mournful refrain in

Mad music—aye, Mammon’s mad music—the song of my

The “devil ” flits backward and forward—poor plaything

The porter of prosings and “ poems,” of paragraphs,

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and interna] organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
chem and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootpids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache —a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite

in the battle Of life. Life’s battle is a hard one, and you must have steady nerve, a clear brain, and muscles like
bands of steel. The weak man or woman must give way to the strong, the robust and the vigorous. Your health and
physical vitality should be guarded as the miser guards his gold. Dr. McLaughlin, the electrical authority, has discov-
ered the .true method of applying Electricity for the perfect cure of the ills and ailments

of mankind. Electricity is Nature’s Remedy. There is not a weak person in
this whole world to-day who cannot become strong, healthy and vigorous again if they
will only apply the right current of Electricity. We have a method of applying Electricity
for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the woi.d.
DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach
Disorders, etc., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electricity,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt, gives to every part
of the body—as it travels over the nerves—strength and vitality, and quickly
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system—not enough electricity to keep up your
nerve force—and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak
man must be made strong before he has the necessary energy and brain power to
succeed. Electricity builds up the shattered nervous system, restores strength and
vitality, makes rich, red blood ; it is the bulwark against which disease must fall. It brings
the sunbeams of happiness and health into a life which has been darkened by weakness. We have thousands of
testimonials to prove all our assertions. Our belt is simple, easy to use and is guaranteed to give a strong current.
It has special attachments fop men and women. They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up.
Beware of cheap imitations.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
Catarrh is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense-pf taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages, 'fhe discharge, passing
through the lungs.and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you

WORMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For what are we, after all, brethren, but miserable
worms ?—Quaint parsonical phrase.
I rise to hurl this rhythmic brick at a sacerdotal tale,
That should make the heart of the thoughtful sick and
even the humblest rail.
They shout the libel to-day as they shouted it centuries
ago :
“Ye are miserable, writhing, wanton worms, and ye
cannot even glow.”
And I have suspected this long time past that they only
call me “ worm ”
Because their imaginations faint in the search for a
nastier term.
They told me the story in Sabbath-school when I was a
chubby mite,
With apple cheeks and a curly head and a “ pinny ” of
spotless white.
They fired it at me in later years when I was a raw-boned
lad,
In the half-mast pants, well-patched behind, that once
had served m3’ dad.
They dinned it then into aching ears, and now that I am
full grown
Theyfkeep on bidding me, like a man, to a rotten worm-
hood own.
Ah, happy, they say, is the wormly man who asks no
n|ore of life
Than’to live to see his wormlets writhe round the knees
of his woriness wife,
Ere baring his back to the spade of Fate and bidding it
shear him through, ‘
As your passionate worm, if he’s worth the name, is
always supposed to do.
Let us squirm in a sodden abjectness, the prey of a
thousand fears,
While living the ardent wormly life through the long,
unlovely years,
For from the band (so parsons tell) of worms who trudge
in boots,
The angel throngs on the astral plane gain all their raw
recruits.
And though sceptical Science is quite agreed that piqs
can never fly,
The parson reckons that worms are good for wings —and
so don’t 1 !
MAORILAND.
SINC. S. CLARK.
A moan from Melbourne :
There are over 170 religious denominations or alleged
churches in Victoria. Among them are such sects
as these:—Relatives of Jesus, Conditional Immor-
tality, Grace-Walking Brethren, Children in God Through
Faith in Jesus Christ, Church of the First-Born, Sabbath
Keepers, The Faith Once Delivered to the Saints, Resti-
tutionists, Restorationists, Peace and Holy Love, Pure
and Undefiled Religion, Followers of Ruskin, Golden
Rulers, Universal Catholics, Providencers, Mennoriites,
Catholics but not Roman Catholics, Knowledge of All,
etc. Then there are Monists, Worshippers of Nature,
Voltaireans, Pantheists, New Lights and Peripatetics.
All of these have licenses to marry, and there are con-
tinually new “ denominations” trying for similar powers.
In Victoria, in 1905, 20 per cent, of the total marriages,
or 1792, were performed at matrimonial agencies. In the
same year there were 180 petitions for divorce, and 128 of
them were granted. The Amended Marriage Act of ’9B
restricted marriage licenses to clergymen of “ recognised
denominations,” and to judge by the list of these there
are twice as many denominations recognised as the
average ctizen has any knowledge of. The corn-,,
plete list of “denominations” includes Particular'
and Strict Baptists, Particular Baptists, English
Baptists, Unattached Baptists, Baptists, Victorian
Free Church, United Welsh Protestants, United Christian,
Free Christian, Unattached Christian, Ballarat Town
Mission, Australian Church, Reorganised Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints, Greek Orthodox, Catholic
Apostolic, New Church, Unitarian, Salvation Army,
United Brethren (Moravians), Seventh Day Adventists,
Church of Christ, Evangelical Lutherans, Concordia
Synod of Australia, Victorian Synod, Emanuel Synod,
Scandinavian, Congregational, Methodist, Welsh Calvin-
istic Methodists, Unattached Methodists, Presbyterian,
Free Presbyterian, Independent Presbyterian, Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Ireland, Roman Catholic, and
Church of England. t
“ Wang ” drinks at a few pubs :
Some of Melbourne’s hotels possess incongruous names.
The word “ View ” happens frequently. There are several
“ Mountain Views,” the only mountain in view being a
mound, with a chamois—l mean a billy or nanny goat —
careering wildly thereon, and often there isn’t even that.
Then there are some “Sea Views”—but the difficulty is
to see the sea. -Several “ Grand Views ” also rear them-
selves heavenwards, the grand view mostly consisting of
a view of over the way. There is a “Rising Sun” or two
where the sun doesn’t rise any more than usual, except
when a son of the city rises, with the aid of Policeman X.
An aviary could be stocked with Melbourne hotels.
There you may find an “ Early Bird,” also a “ Dove ” or
two, an “ Eagle,” “ Curlew',” “ Emu,” “ Magpie,” “ Pea-
cock,” “Swan,” “Stork,” “Spread Eagle” and a “Hen
and Chickens.” Of trees there’s quite a variety : “ Apple-
tree,” “Cherry-tree,” “Lemon-tree,” “ Willow-tree,”
“Beech-tree”; also several “Vines,” a “Laurel,”
“ Royal Oak ” and “ Myrtle.”
There'are several “Red Lions” crouching about, keep-
ing an eye on an “ Old Lamb,” “ White Hart,” “ White;
Horse,” a “Greyhound” or two, and such animal remnants
as “Bucks’ Heads” and “Stags’ Heads” and a “Bull
and Mouth.”
Then, again, one may gaze upon any number of
“ Queens,” whole or dismembered. There’s the “ Queen’s
Arms,” and the “ Queen’s Head,” and the “ Queen’s Legs ”
—no, I think I’m wrong there, we haven’t got her Legs.
Not far from the “ Hurling Club ” in South Melbourne
is the “ Hit or Miss” ; and a “ Horseshoe ” and a “ Battle-
axe ” are fairly handy up in Carlton.
In Colling wood is to be found an hotel bearing the
singularly appropriate name of the “Glasshouse.”
Fitzroy has a “Labor in Vain” and a “Commotion.”
Other queer names are “ The Coach and Horses,” “ Adam
and Eve,” “Anchor and Hope” (what for?), “ Beehive,”
“Harvest Home,” “New Constitution,” “O’Connell
Centenary,” “ Nugget and Woolpack,” “ Perseverance,”
“ Waterloo Cup” and “ Yorkshire Stingo.”
“ Oby ” writes
It takes the British Tory, or his relative, the well-to-do
Liberal, a long time to' focus a point outside the range of
his everyday thought ; but when he does turn
the bull’s eye on and realises the, character of that
which has neither parts nor magnitude, he gene-
rally shapes up to the object with commendable
directness. Since the recent assassination of a British
official by a Hindu student, loud and lachrymose
have been going up from ■refined England as to the de-
plorable isolation in w'hich the normal Britisher keeps
the young Hindus who visit his Country to perfect their
education. Their lives in lonely lodgings are tear,
fully described, and it has been surmised that
it is this loneliness which generates assassinations
and other outrages. Wherefore, the latitudinous in-
sist that it is the duty of the Colonial Office
to keep a list of names of cultivated English families
w'hich will be willing to receive as boarders wealthy
Indian students, and that this list shall be available to
each batch of students as they arrive. It is just here
that Bull focuses the point accurately. The Spectator.
(London) says: “It is impossible to deny that Indiaq
students look upon women and all the problems of sex iri;
a way which must make us feel it undesirable that;
they should mix freely with our women. We can treat
them with kindliness, sympathy and respect without
making them temporary members of our family.” So the
idea of regarding Chunder Sen as a real brother and equal
fellow-subject goes broke once more.
If you have indigestion and fear to eat
anything your stomach craves, take Chamberlain’s
Tablets; they strengthen the digestive organs.*
The management of the “Robur” Tea Co. is
noted for the thoroughness with which they do every-
thing. For some years past the Robur Tea Co. have dis-
tributed free calendars as an advertisement, each publi-
cation being an improvement, and this year’s series show'
such an advance that it would be difficult to make
further improvement. Two works of Art in the Sydney
and one in the Melbourne National Galleries, have been
copied. Anyone having seen “Their Ever Shifting
Home,” or “ The First Cloud ” must recognise the truth-
fulness of the reproduced copy. The Company are send-
ing a number out to each grocer, and they hope by this
means to have them distributed throughout the Common-
wealth in such a way that all who want a “Robur”
Calendar will be able to get it free.*
South Aus., which has done hardly any
railway-building since the Northern line reached
Oodnadatta, 19 years ago, has just decided on
four new lines. One, starting in Adelaide, is to
open up the populous farming country southward
to Willunga. This line, about 30 miles long, has
been talked about for nearly 40 years, and but for
a cat-fight over the route would have been built
long ago. The other three, about 100 miles each,
are to link various backblocks with the coast, and
are expected to make something over three million
acres of fairly good land available for wheat-
growing. Cohen will, of course, provide the
money—the local Cohen for preference.
“The Snake”: From July 1, 1906, to
August 1, 1908, there were 70 prohibition-orders
granted against persons residing in the No Licence
town of Invercargill (M.L.). Invercargill is the
little place at the windy tail-end of the South
Island, where the Donalds carried No License
(which doesn’t mean no grog) a few years
ago, and have been living on the fat of
the wholesale drink system ever since. You
get your liquor cheaper in Invercargill than
elsewhere, for you buy it wholesale. Every male
who feels dry belongs to a club. Every clubman
has a locker, and inside the locker is his refresh-
ment. Thp manager of the club puts in new
refreshment as soon as he has drunk the old
refreshment, or even earlier; and as the club buys
much refreshment it gets it at bedrock price.
When you visit Invercargill with a letter of intro-
duction, your friend instructs the club manager to
give you the free run "1 his locker. In addition,
almost everybody has liquor in the house. The
keg has come to due > in the bosom of the family.
In fact, an impress. on prevails that Donald of
Invercargill only voted No Licence because he
didn’t get enough liquor the old way.
MARE CLAUSUM.

To-day it is my wedding day—
Oh, tell your ghost to stay away.
It creeps beside me in the night,
And now it comes, though it is light.
And stands before me, just one pace,
Staring so silent in my face.
We loved much, yet it could not be ;
I was foresworn, and you not free.
Oh, man I love, keep far away ;
To-day, it is my wedding day.
S. S. SEVERN.


There was anguish in the N.S.W. Leg. Council
a week or so ago when the State proposed to take
the right to buy certain big estates during the
next five years and pay the full present value for
them—every penny that anybody would be pre-
pared to give to-dav. But not a Fatman’s cry of
anguish was raised when the State proposed to
take certain coal raised by certain miners and
pay for it less than half the price that
those miners could sell it for. When the
landlords go on strike and won’t sell their
land, and thus cause high prices, any attempt to
make, them take a penny less is confiscation and
robbery. When miners go on 1 strike, and won t
sell their labor, and thus cause high prices for
coal, every attempt to make them take less isn’t
also confiscation and robbery—it is just plain
common-sense. Fat’s cordial concurrence in this
will be well worth remembering in future. What
is sauce for the coi^LJgjsauce for the land.
The S. M. has solved the pro-
blem of how to serve GocNand Mammon. Edi-
torially it yells for everything to be brought to
Sydney, so that its friends, the big advertisers,
can have a comfortable bite ; but in its “On the
Land ” page it says that the policy of dragging
everything to Sydney is just plain infamous:
With the extension of our railway system is also the
necessity for connecting the railways with more sea-
ports, and making, a better use’ of at present-neglectexl,
natural facilities along our coastline. Much of the trouble
in our traffic problem, with its consequent loss to the
men on the land, arises f rom the policy that concentrates
the whole of our railway transport into the metropolis.
The Bulletin has hopes of yet seeing the Herald
printed green on one side and yellow on the other,
with a column for importers cursing Protection
and another column for manufacturers cursing
Freetrade. Finally the Fowl column will be cut
in halves : the top half will swear by Blue Lang-
shans and the bottom will pin its hopes of salva-
tion to Pink Orpingtons. The purse of Mr.
James will no doubt grow heavy, but the .editor
(if by that time it will be worth while having an
editor) will wear a worried look.

The Song of a Prison.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
~jVT"OW this is the song of a prison—a song of
\ a gaol or jug—
-1 A ballad of quod or of chokey, the ulti-
mate home of the mug.
The yard where the Foolish are drafted ; Hell’s
school where the harmless are taught;
For the big beast never is captured and the great
thief never is caught.
A song of the trollop’s victim, and the dealer in
doubtful eggs,
And a song of the man who was ruined by the lie
with a thousand legs.
A song of suspected persons and rogue-and-
vagabond pals,
And of persons beyond suspicion—the habitual
criminals.
’Tis a song of the weary warders, whom prisoners
call “ the screws ”
A class of men who I fancy would cleave to the
Evening News.
They look after their treasures sadly. By the
screw of their keys they are known,
And they screw them many times daily before
they draw their own.
It is written on paper pilfered from the prison
printery,
With a stolen stump of a pencil that a felon
smuggled for me.
And he’d have got twenty-four hours in the cells
if he had been caught,
With bread to eat and water to drink and plenty
of food for thought.
And I paid in chews of tobacco from one who is
in for life ;
But he is a debent fellow—he only murdered his
wife.
(He is cherub-like, jolly, good-natured, and frank
as the skies above.
And his Christian name is Joseph, and his other,
ye gods ! is Love !)
The Governor knows, and the Deputy, and all of
the warders know,
Once a week, and on Sunday, we sit in a sinful
row,
And bargain for chews of tobacco under the cover
of prayer— ,
And the harmless Anglican chaplain is the only
innocent there.
Staircase and doors of iron, no sign of a plank or
brick,
Ceilings and floors of sandstone, and the cell walls
two feet thick;
Cell like a large-sized coffin, or a small-sized tomb,
and white,
And it strikes a chill to the backbone on the
warmest summer night.
For fifteen hours they leave you to brood in the
gloom and cold
On the cheats that you should have cheated, and
the lies that you should have told ;
On the money that would release you, you lent to
many a friend,
And the many a generous action you suffered for
in the end.
Grey daylight follows softly the heartless electric
light
That printed the bars of the window on the wall
of the cell all night;
The darkness has vanished “hushing” when there
is nothing to hush
And I think of the old grey daylight on the
teamster’s camp in the bush.
I think of the low bark homestead, the yard and
the sinister bail,
And the shed in a hole in the gully—a pigsty
compared with gaol;
The drought and the rows and the nagging ; the
hill where a flat grave is—
The gaol of my boyhood as dreadful and barren
and grey as this.
We rise at six when the bell rings, and roll up
our blankets neat,
Then we pace the cell till seven, brain-dulled and
with leaden feet.
Bolts clank and the iron doors open, light floods
from an iron-barred arch—
And we start with a start galvanic at the passion-
less, “Left—Quick march!”
Down the crooked and winding staircase in the
great wrong-angular well,
Like the crooked stairs that of late years we have
stumbled down to Hell;
We empty the tubs and muster, with the prison
slouch and tread,
And we take to the cells our breakfast of hominy
and of bread.
The church in its squat round tower, with Christ
in His thorny wreath—
The reception house is below it, so the gates of
Hell are beneath,
Where sinners are* clad and numbered, when
hope for a while has died—
And above us the gilded rooster that crowed when
Peter lied.
What avail is the prayer of the abbess ? Or the
raving of Cock-eyed Liz ?
The holy hermit in his cell, or the Holy Terror in
his?
Brothers and sisters of Heaven, seen through the
bars in a wall,
As we see the uncaught sinners—and God have
mercy on all.
N.S.W.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Widow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS canvassing for members for a
medical benefit society, and the smart young
man who called himself “The Secretary”
used to impress upon me the wisdom of confining
my attention to the lower portions of the town.
It was only the poor, he said, who joined that sort
of society. They didn’t want any of the others
even should they be inclined to join, because they
expected a great deal too much for their money.
So I spent my days wandering round the parts of
the city that were but a little removed from
slums.
The cottage was undeniably ancient. The
stones of which it was built were branded with the
broad arrow that intimated that it belonged to the
bad old days when men worked in irons in N.S. W.
It stood far back from the street, and the inter-
vening garden was filled with rank grass, and
hollyhocks and dog daisies struggled through the
lank, dusty tangle. Rising from the waste, like
monuments in a desert, were two stone cats sit-
ting serenely on their pedestals. Altogether it
was a quaint old place.
I unlatched the gate, and, walking down the
well-paved path, knocked at the door. The sound
echoed through the place as though it were empty.
Although it was in Surry Hills it was quiet
enough a little bye-street which, strangely
enough, was devoid of children. Heaven knows
where they came from, but a couple of stray bees
were looting the hollyhocks and humming con-
tentedly at their work.
Suddenly the door was pulled back, and the
sight of a chain showed that the person within
was on guard. Then a little bright face framed
in thin grey hair, and lit up with bright black
eyes, appeared at the door.
“I don’t want a sewing-machine—l have two.
An’ me eyes are too weak to read much, so I
don’t want to buy any books. I can’t play the
piano, and I’m too old to insure me life. Which
is it?”
And her cheerful little old face was wreathed
in smiles.
“None of those you have mentioned—would
you care to try again?”
The chain was slipped off the door, and the
ancient lady came out and stood on the step,
pondering deeply:
“ Well, p’raps it’s some other musical instrument
—but I don’t want any. If it isn’t that, well it
must be the ’lection, though that’s a long way off
yet.”
“Wrong again ! Somehow, I don’t think you’d
ever guess it.”
“Oh yes, I would—it’s tea, or time-payment
furniture, an’ me house is cumbered up with fur-
niture.”
“ No, it’s a medical benefit society ! ”
Her face became interested. “How much a
week ? ”
“ One shilling a fortnight—free medical attend-
ance and medicine (barring liniments) free, all
thrown in.”
“Seems very reasonable. Come inside?”
It was almost dark, and the dame opened the
Venetian blinds. The afternoon sunlight suddenly
streamed over a gaudily furnished room. The
suite was covered with red plush. There were side-
boards crowded with what looked like fairly good
plate. Old-fashioned antimacassars were care-
fully spread over the backs of the chairs, and the
walls were crowded with sombre oil paintings.
Underfoot a high-grade Axminster carpet was
full of fleas, and table and mantel were crowded
with wax-fruit under glass cases.
“ You look tired, an’ I’m goin’ to have a cup of
tea, an’ I like company when I’m havin’ tea. The
young woman what usually keeps me company is
out. She has an aunt what went mad on the end
of the world, in Gladesville, and she’s gone up to
see her. Mary Jenkins is her name, and she’s a
well-brought-up and proper girl.”
The tea was delicious and the cups she served
it in valuable. I held mine up and looked at it
thoughtfully.
“ Nice cups, ain’t they ? Me second husband’s
father left me them. He was a very proud gentle-
man, was me second husband’s father, but very
good to me. ‘ Albert,’ he says to his son, ‘ you’ve
got a good wife. See you treats her proper, for
she’s made you what you are.’ An’ I did, too.”
“ And did he ? ” I queried.
“La, yes, till he was took. But his mother
never took to me at all. But after Albert was
took she was kinder to me.”
“ What was he taken for ? ” I asked innocently
enough, for I had discovered that when anyone is
“took” in Surry Hills, it is understood to be by
the police.
She shook her head, and poured out two more cups
of tea. Then she rose softly, and opening a door,
beckoned me to follow. I found myself in a bed-
room which was a sort of museum. The widow
opened a big wardrobe, the front of which gleamed
with copper and plate-glass, and as she opened the
door there hung in view an assortment of male
clothing of bygone ages. Trousers that must have
been almost skin-tight, “frog” silk waistcoats,
and coats with long tails. Curious old scarves,
and a variety of ancient headgear.
“ Them’s all their clothes, what they wore when
they was took.”
I gazed sympathetically, and the air became
heavy with the odor of camphor.
“ That’s to keep the silverfish out of ’em. They
eat me first husband’s blue cloth trousers and me
third husband’s frog vest. Terrible, ain’t it?”
“Dreadful!” I said, shaking my head, and
wondering how I was going to get away fr'om this
cheerful lunatic.
“Well, come and finish the tea, or it ’ll be cold,
and I can’t a-bear cold tea. Always liked me
little drop hot and strong. Soothes yer nerves,
they do say,”
She chattered back into the sitting-room, or
whatever the other room was called.
“I’ve had a sad life, Mister. I was 17 when I
got married first. He was a carter, earned good
money too, and brought it all home. So when we
came back from our honeymoon he got two days
off, an’ we went up the line a bit to a farm-house.
What was I sayin’? Oh, yes, when we got back
I made him insure his life. He said it was un-
lucky ; but I told him it would be unluckier still
if I was left without a bite or a sup for me an’ the
children.”
“ How many children did you have ? ”
“None! But, poor man, ’twas unlucky fer
him. Three days after he went to sleep on the
front of the cart, and slipped off. The wheel
broke his neck.”
The widow stopped for a moment and dried her
eyes, took another sip of tea, and resumed.
“ Well, I got the insurance money an’ put it in
the bank, wonderin’ what I’d do. A house is a
dreadful place when yer alone in it after yer hus-
band’s bin took. The loneliness got me down, an’
I just sold the carts and horses, let me house as it
stood, and gotter place in a gentleman’s family.
It was a good place, an’ I took me wardrobe with
me, an’ every night I’d open it an’ look at his
clothes, his best Sunday ones—hangin’ there just
as though nothin’ ’ad happened to him. An’
ev’ry Saturday morn in’ I used ter get up early and
take ’em out and let ’em air, an’ at night I’d
brush ’em up ready to wear like. Sometimes I’d
find meself listenin’ fer his step. An’ then I’d
howl. I was very fond of him, mister, very fond
of him.”
Again the relict dried her eyes.
“ Well, we gets over everything in time. I was
only 21, and the young gentleman of the house
took a great'fancy to me. Said I was very pretty.
He useter wait on the stairs till I was goin’ up with
me arms full of sheets, pillerslips an’ the like, an’
unable ter defend meself, an’ catch me at ther
corners and kiss me.

Sickened at Sight of Food—Many
Treatments Failed to Cure.
Mr. J. J. Higgins, of North Street, Maryborough, Q.,
tells how he suffered from that distressing complaint,
Biliousness, and how Bile Beans cured him after other
treatments entirely failed.
“About four years ago,” says Mr. Higgins, “I was
subject to Biliousness, so much so that even the sight of
cheese, pastry and the like would bring
on a sudden attack. I tried several pro-
fessed cures for Biliousness, but met
with no success. One day I happened
to receive a little pamphlet, wherein
I noticed that Bile Beans had cured
similar cases, and I decided to test their
merits in my case. The first few doses
afforded me relief, and thus encouraged I
continued the course, with the result that
I am now entirely free from Biliousness.
I can eat, without fear, items of food
previously so disastrous to my health. In
fact, Biliousness and myself are now com-
plete strangers, and I go through my
day’s work with pleasure, having lost that fear of an
attack of Biliousness coming on me at any moment of the
day, as experienced previous to my cure. I would advise
all Bilious sufferers to give Bile Beans a trial, and have
full confidence they will prove as effective as they
were In my case.”

THE
QUESTION of the DAY.
The question of to-day,
of to-morrow and of
every succeeding day is
HAVE YOU USED PEARS’ SOAP ?
If you have not, you have not
done your duty by your skin and
complexion. If, on the other hand
—that is, on both hands, and on the
face, and on the sKin generally—you
HAVE used PEARS, you can feel
happy, for you will have done the
best that possibly can be done tor
the shin’s health and beauty. There
can be no question! about that.
PEARS has been making beautiful
complexions for nearly 120 years.

Matchless for the Complexion.
“ I used ter tell him if his mother caught ’im
there’d be trouble, an’ I’d get the sack. But he’d
only laugh an’ kiss me some more. He was very
headstrong.
“ He used ter worry me to go to the theaytre ;
but I was frightened we’d be copped, an’ put him
off. But he kept on pressin’’me an’kissin’me,
an’ to keep him outer trouble I consented. He
told me where ter meet him, an’ treated me like a
real lydy. Took me down in a keb to a flower
shop, where they pinned a wreath in me hair, an’
then to the dress circle, where he bought me a
boxer sweets big as me ’ead. Afterwards we druv
to within a block of the ’ouse, an’ got in without
annybody knowin’.
“After that he was always talcin’ me out.
Used ter buy me lovely dresses an’ take me to the
races an’ places like that. Said I was pretty, but
as I couldn’t talk properly he couldn’t introjuce
me to his friends. His friends began to talk
about the pretty bit of muslin that he was jealous
of, an’ tease him. In course o’ time, of all people,
his mother heard about it, an’ laid herself out to
see the mystery.
“ She went to the races just ter see that lovely
girl her son had got talked about with. La, when
she saw me she just fainted almost. Flopped
down on a seat an’ sez : ‘ My Gawd ! ’
“I was frightened to go home and frightened
to stay, and didn’t know what to do. She settled
it for us. She sailed up like a queen an’ ordered
me home right away. He sent me in a keb, and
she an’ him followed in another.
“ Oh dear, it makes me feel shivery yet, to think
the names she called me. She said I was an
adventuress, an’ a hussy. She told, me to take off
me ‘ ill-got finery ’ and get out of her ’ouse. An’
Albert, he up an’ sez, quite angry :
“ “Her finery’s just as honestly gotten as yours
—an’ if she goes Igo with her. That’s all ! ’
“Then there was a row, an’ in the end we
drove away together in a keb. Poor boy, he’d no
idea of earnin’ his own living, an’ she promised
him he ’ud get nothing from his father ; an’ she
did rule that poor man with a rod er iron. So,
■ while the keb drove along, I asked him what he
was goin’ to do. He said he wud marry me first.
I said he’d better go home an’make peace with
his mother. He could get lots er wives but no
more mothers, I told him. He swore, an’ said he
would marry just who he jolly well pleased. In
the end I sent him to one boarding-house while I
went to another. I’d plenty of money—all me
insurance money not touched and me rent banked
ev’ry week.
“ Then I writes his mother a perlite note tellin’
her where her son was to be found, an’ how he
wanted to marry me, but that I didn’t think I
was stylish enough for him. An’ I told her
straight it was a great honor to a girl like me to
have an offer from so fine a gent, an’ that if he
pressed me I couldn’t refuse him much longer.
“She got it next mornin’, and came straight
down to see me.
“‘Ann,’ she says, very meekly, ‘ yer a good
girl. I’m sorry I said bad words to you yester-
day. Please forgive me ; I unnerstan’ better now.
Young men is very wild. You’d be very unhappy
if you was to marry ’im. No good comes of
marryin’ out of yer station.’
“ So she paid me fare up country to a township
in New England, where I gotter place an’ settled
down. It was very quiet after the races an’
theaytres, but I didn’t mind. I ’ad me wardrobe
with me, an’ useter think of me poor, dear husband.
The people on the station was very kind—
’specially the master. One day he caught me
roun’ the waist an’ kissed me ; an’ my stars, how
did he talk? Shockin’ he was—talked about a
cottage; an’ kept; hold of me all the time, he
talked till somethin’ hit me on the side of the
head, an’ when I got up I saw his wife layin’ into
him with a whip. I was fired that night, an’ got
to Sydney next mornin’. .
“ One mornin’ I was standin’ on the balcony of
the boardin’-house when I hears me name called ;
and next moment the blessed door of the room
flies open, an’ Albert bounds on ter the balcony.
“I wanted to squeal, but he caught me so tight
I couldn’t. Then he carried me inside an’ hugged
me till I couldn’t speak.
“ ‘ Will yer marry me, yo’ little devil ? ’ sez he.
“ I tried to speak, but he squeezed me too tight.
I tried to wriggle, but it was no good. An’ I was
so glad to have his arms roun’ me again I didn’t
want ter speak. So before I knew what I was
doin’ I had me hat on and was inter a keb, an’ at
a marrying shop. Then I tried to draw out, but
he said he’d get a year’s imprisonment if I re-
fused, as it would look as though he was abductin’
me. So when the parson asked me, I said
“ Yes! ’ and when I came out I was a married
woman.
“He didn’t break the news at home for a
month, an’ they kicked ’im out. He wa.s very
down in ther mouth. But I took me money outer
the bank an’ made him start a house an’ land
agency in a suburb what was growin’ very quick.
He had brains, too, had Albert, an’ in a little
while we was doin’ very well. One day his father
came to see him. He was out, so he said he’d
have a look over the house. Seemed quite ’ston-
ished to find how comfortable we was. I told him
Albert always made five pun a week, sometimes
more, and sometimes big sums. ‘ Made £7O in
one lump, last week, sir ! ’ I said.
“He stared at me. He was a nice old man.
Then he shook his head. ‘ Where did he get the
money to start ?’ he asked. I told him about the
insurance money an’ the rent. He wagged his
headagain. ‘You’ve made him,’he said. ‘Couldn’t
have got a better wife in Sydney, damned if he
could. Must see him ! ’
“So he stayed to dinner, an’ had a friendly
chat with his son, an’ we all went to the theaytre
together that night. Next day Albert’s mother
drove out in a keb, an’was as nice as she could be,
poor lady ; but it was hard on her, yo’ know. I
never could talk properly. She said she ’ud have
me eddicated. _
“Well, I made Albert insure his life. He
didn’t want to do it; but I kept him up to it, an’
in the end he did it for £5OO. Lotter money,
wasn’t it ? ’
“Well, his father wantin’ him to come into his
business to look after things, Albert sells the
agency business an’ goes to his father’s place,
which was in the wholesale line,'somewhere near
the Quay.
“ He was making good money, an’ without say-
ino- a word he takes out some more insurance,
making it £l5OO, an’ all for me. Then one day he
was took.”
The widow wept steadily for five seconds.
“For the first time in his life he come home
drunk. He’d been squiffy' before, but never real
tight. This time he was awful. I got him to bed,
and made him hot soup with plenty pepper in it.
If ever you gets on a real bender, always take
plenty soup with lots o’ pepper in it. It squares
yo’ up in no time.
“ I slept on the sofa that night, an’ early in the
morning I hears him gettin’ up. ‘Where you
going, dear?’ I calls out.
“ ‘Only fer a hair of ther dog ! he says cheer-
fully enough. ‘ I’ll only have one, an’ then come
an’ have some grilled chops. Nice ones ! ’
“ Then he went out. I jumped up and set the
table while the chops was grillin’, but he
didn’t come back. I put -’em in the oven,
with butter over ’em, an’ made hot tomato
sauce in the little pot. But he didn’t come.
I went up to his room and had a look :
his clothes lay on the floor, with the money still
i.n the pockets. The side-door was open where he
had slipped out into the lane to go to the pub.
The only thing that was missing was his best over-
coat, which had only come home a few days
before. But he never came back. He was just
took ! ”
“ But did you never hear what became of him?”
I inquired, staggered by this Elijah-like vanish-
ment. i
“No; we advertised and made inquiries, paid
detectives heaps of money, but never found no
trace. We went to the pub. but they had never
seen nothin’ of him there. He just went.”
And again the widow mopped her eyes.
“So I just put his clothes in the wardrobe —and
they’re there yet. Me father-in-law was very
good to me, an’ gave me an income; an’ me
mother-in-law became much kinder, always saying
that I was a good wife to him, an’ it was shameful
to treat me that way. They never b’lieved he
was dead ; but I knew better nor that. Strange
things happens in this world, an’ lots o’ people
have been took.
“So I lived on with the old people till the old
lady died, an’ then I kept house for the old gentle-
man till he got a stroke, an’ died too, leaving me
a rich woman. His life was insured, an’ he left it
all to me, so that in the end I never missed not
getting Albert’s money, which the swindlin’ in-
surance co. would never pay.
“It was very lonesome in the old house when
the old gentleman had gone. I stayed there for
two years, an’ then the place got on me nerves.
I sold it and came to live here in me own old
placeman’ I bin here ever since. I thought I’d
keep a boarder or two for somethin’ to occupy me
time, an’ put in an advertisement, and got a
couple o’ gentlemen for the two back rooms. I
kept the front one for myself, because the ward-
robe was too big for the back ones. One of the
boarders stayed a month, an’ then the police got
him for somethin’ or other, and that left me alone
in the house with the other, who was a middle-
aged gentleman, and of a kind disposition. He
had a bit of an income, and never did no work ;
just read books and wrote his dairies every day.
“ He was a wonderful man—had lots of instru-
ments, an’ used to study very deep.. One day he
said he must sell some books an’ papers ’cause he
wanted a microscope. I didn’t like to see the
poor man sell his things that he seemed so fond
of, an’ lent him the money to get the machine he
wanted.
“’Twas an evil-minded neighborhood, an' the
people began to talk. So one day I told him
me character was gone an’ he’d have to go, just to
clear me name. He said the place suited him
beautifully, an’ it would break his heart to go.
He said he would think it over, an’ one or two
days more wouldn’t matter. I thought the place
would be lonesome when he was away, an’ I
couldn’t stand bein’ lonely anyhow. So I told
him how I felt, an’ he said he felt that way too.
He hated boardin’-houses proper, ’cause they
always fried the chops. He’d never had such
comfort in his life before. He said he would have
liked to offer marriage, but his income was so
small. But his life was insured for hundreds of
pounds, an’ some day his dairies would be worth
thousands.
“I told him how he needn’t worry himself
about ways an’ means, as I’d more money nor I
knew what to do with. But I’d like his company,
and if we was married it would stop people talk-
ing—they dursent talk when we was lawfully
wedded. He agreed, so we just went out and got
married, and let the people talk for about six
months, when we sent ’em lawyers’ letters, and
had some of’em to court. My word, you should
have seen the way their mouths fell down when I
showed the Judge me marriage lines.”
And the widow glared fiercely with the memory
of that triumph.
“ He was a kind soul, but, like lots of others,
couldn’t stand good fortune. He just took to the
drink, and was took in the midst of his cups, as
the parson said. ,?
“But he was a decent husband when he vyas
sober, an’ he made his will all square an’ proper,
an’ I got £5OO, an’ put ic in the bank. I’ve got
his clothes in the wardrobe, too. I’ll show’em
all to you when you’ve had another cup of tea.”
And the widow rose up and, bustling round,
brewed another pot of delicious tea, which she
left to-“ draw ” while she rinsed out the cups.
When she came back with the renovated cups she
had recovered her composure and was beaming
again.
“Yes, mister, I’ve had a hard life, I have. By
the way, young man, is your life insured ?”
But I swallowed the tea hastily, glanced' at my
gun-metal ticker, and suddenly remembering I
had to be back at the office at 4 p.m. I fled. Had
I stayed, I’m sure my only three-guinea suit
would have gained a place in the wardrobe also.

Ballade of Mammon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE gods are dead !- By sea and shore,
Which 1 once resounded with their
tread.
Their old abodes lie drifted o’er
With sand from Time’s great hour-glass
shed;
Their grov.es are lost ; their priests are fled ;
None worship or libation pour ;
Their altar-fires are no"more-fed—
But Mammon lives for evermore !
The simple, ardent faith of yore,
For which the grand old Pagans bled—
The wondrous legendary lore
Which lit the world, is passed and sped—
Theology itself is dead—
Belief now centres in the Spore,
Or in the protoplasmic bed—
But Mammon lives for evermore !
Fire-flinging Jove and rugged Thor,
Osiris bright and Pluto dread,
Have disappeared, with score on score
Of gods Man’s fear or fancy bred ;
Now milk-and-water creeds are spread
In sermons that provoke a snore,
Where tepid Hells flare faintly red—
But Mammon lives for evermore !
Envoy.
Men come and go, are born and wed ;
Old gods abjure; new gods adore ;
By Fate are driven ; by Fortune led—
But Mammon lives for evermore !

“I attribute my present good health to the use of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It is now three years since I first
