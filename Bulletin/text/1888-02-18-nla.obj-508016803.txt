SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18 1888
The Impartiality of Police Prosecutions.
Statements have been made by the Sydney Press
in connection with the Mount Ilennie case which,
if true (and they are far more than colorably true),
peculiarly emphasise the almost autocratic and
tyrannical control assumed by publicly-appointed
trustees and guardians of publicly-subscribed
moneys for specific purposes, and admirably illus-
trate a mal administration cf charitable funds
which, in New South Wales at least, bids fair to
become chronic. The mother colony of the Aus-
tralian group must to the other States and to the
outside world furnish forth instances enough and
to spare to point a moral and adorn a tale when-
ever a case of breach of trust or a dereliction of
public duty shall afford an opportunity for such
an application. The Soudan Contingent and
Bulli Relief Funds are only two of many flagrant
examples of the ease, and security to the offenders,
with which the intention of the public may be sen
aside and entirely put in f o the background by the
very committees appointed by the subscribers to
give effect to their wishes. Ihe latest example, par
ticulars of which were given in last Friday’s issue
of a Sydney evening paper, the Australian
Star, is in connection with an affair which The
Bulletin alone has always consistently and
Vehemently ridiculed —namely, the raising of a
fund in recognition of the “ valour ” of a person
named Stanley, who was alleged to have ren-
dered some service of peculiar value to the girl
Mary Jane Hicks. Nevertheless, if the Star’s
statements are true, this instance more than ever
accentuates the indifference of committees to the
will and intention of the subscribers whose funds
they disburse.
* * *
In the first place, who was Stanley ? Mr
Stanley, the most important witness at the
Mount Rennie trial—chiefly on the strength of
whose evidence nine youths were sentenced to death
and four of them hanged—was a mysterious dead-
beat, an enigmatical Johnny Warder, a common
vagrant, whose oath was given in support of the
evidence of a complaisant street-walker and an
ostracised jockey. Ihe dubioui story was subse-
quently flatly contradicted on affidavit by
another witness and accomplice in tall swearing,
namely, one Brown, whose statement, it must be
remembered, is quite as good as Stanley’s, and
his recantation of his previously-rendered evidence
is probably true, as it was not the result of any hope
of gain. Through all the devious interwind ngs
of the trial one thing is immediately apparent:
the Mount Rennie prosecution was a police-made
case, in which the intelligent and vigilant officer of
the law seemed to put himself in competition with
the reporter of revolting details, and vied in
Zolaesque sensationalism with certain bloodthirsty
newspapers. In order to gra’ify the self-
excusatory theories of a selfish and indifferent
middle.-classjwhich controls the organs of alleged
public opinion and guards the avenues to official
preferment, the police sought to depict the
Mount Ronnie offenders as a set of
uniquely aggressive larrikins, who, like
the hordes of ancient Scythia, or packs of
hungry wolves, threatened to leave their fast-
nesses and assail society in its stronghold,
and to subvert the entire fabric raised
by a century of civilisation; whereas, it
is now perfectly p’ain to every unprejudiced
person that tbs offence for which four bos a were
hanged and five locked up for life, was
simply a filthy and commonplace orgy indulged in
amongst themselves by people of a filthy class.
The Bulletin does not say that any and every
woman, however degraded, is not entitled to
physical protection, but it holds that every
woman who desires the full protection and
avengement awarded by the law to female inno-
cence must comport herself as a pure woman, and
not invite attention by the tricks of the wanton.
If, as in the case of Miss Mary Jane Hicks, when a
strange cabman simply crooks his finger at her, a
woman will le ip into his vehicle, and suffer him
to drive her to some lonely and secluded spot, can
she be regarded as having the same claims to re-
dress as the decent woman who is un-
provokedly assailed by ruffians ? Virtue
Is a mental quality in a far greater degree
than it is a physiological attribute. An offence
committed by a lewd man against an immodest
and immodestly-aoting woman is a mere offence
against properly—the sort of property dealt in by
every strumpet who waffs the street; an offence
committed by a brutal man against a mode
woman who acts modestly is an offence against
noble ideal.
• * *
But to return to Stanley ! While this enigm
tical dead-beat was waifng to give his eviden
the polica supplied him with board and lodging,
was police-kept and spoon-fed until he was wante
or ratter he won d have been could the police bav
managed it, but they reckoned without the
guest. Hardly had the accused been committee
for trial than the hero of fictional invention go
drunk and disappeared, leaving no trace bshin
him, re-appearing as suddenly and as une
pectedly, just at the time a hysterical Press wa
reeking with horrible suggestions regarding th
“ hero’s ” probable fate Stanley’s tale was
the effect that wicked people had endeavoured t
do away with him, to suppress him. He hac
been hocussed, kidnapped, marooned, stranded
and left to die of starvation in Newcastle, Ne
South Wales. The police were glad to have r
covered him and guarded him more
for without Stanley there could have been n
drop-kick denouement. The “ hero’s” next sei
sational appearance was at Darlinghurst Cour
house, where he gave the evidence which assisted
in the hanging of four bo s and the sentencing I
life-imprlso .merit of five others, '1 his is the cllrna
of his story ; henceforward his path becomes
rough and thorny.
* * *
.After the executions Mr. Stanley b’gan t
reap in his reward. As the alleged rescuer of Miss
Hicks he was forthwith fashioned into a “ hero,
and, as it is now the custom for all “ heroes ” t
receive testimonials, the hat was passed round o
his behalf. Unli re the heroes of ancient days ou
modern type is not satisfied with the crown o:
parsley, he asks for the butter as well. Minni
Palmer, always on the qui vine for an advertise
merit, sent him a £25-diamoid ring|: credulous ole
maids tremblingly subscribed their little half
sovereigns, a.d the Mayor of Sydney publicly
described the recipient of all this bounty as a hero
“worthy of the Victoria Cross” But just as
the choir was preparing to sing the triumpha
cantata, and the money wa* ready for pres-nta
tion, Mr. Stanley again disappeared, this time
as wonderfully and mysteriously as though he
had never lived. There was a good and vallc
reason for his departure. He had hitherto been
maintained by the police and the newspaper-re
porters—a curious conjunction —the latter minis
tering to his bibulous necessities by the donatioi
of shillings and sixpences. But Stanley, tired o:
this very slow mode of procedure, had now
uttered a forged cheque upon the firm cf his
benefactor and enthusiastic admirer. Mayor
Riley.
« * *
The police were called upon to proceed againsi
their quondam hero. An information was
sworn against Stanley by the publican who had
cashed the cheque, which bore Stanley's endorss-
ment, a signature bearing unremarkable likeness to
the hand-writing in the body of the document.
By and bye Mr. Stanley re-appeared once more in
Sydney, and this time he told his old friends, the
evening-newspaper reporters, that he had been in
New Zealand, which was a lie, and had returned to
prosecute his maligners—which was mere ‘ ‘ bluff ”
Then a reporter who had been lending him money
handed him over to the police. When these
faithful guardians of public morality had the un-
pleasant task imposed upon them of “running
in ” a man who had made such a “ good case,”
they proved themselves equal to the emergency.
Mr. Stanley, having been arrested, had next to
be brought before the court, by which he was re-
manded for a week. At the termination of this
period no prosecutor appeared, and he was dis-
charged. Not a word of comment appeared
concerning the fact in that same Sydney daily
press which had “ boomed ” this iniquity at the
commencement, lad touted to the hangman, and
had sacrificed to the gallows.
« •
By law it is quite permissible for any man,
before swearing an information, to compound any
offence against property, but not after he has
done so. Ten thousand times more is such a
course to be opposed in a case wherein enormous
issues are at stake, involving the whole question
of the credibility of a Crown witness—for i: may
be here remarked that the forger is only the
perjurer in another form. Stanley’s credi-
bility as a witness —provided he was guilty
of what he was «harged wi.h and there is every
reason to suppose he was —is just as low as that of
the two other chief witnesses for the Crown, one of
whom, since the Mount Bennie trial, it is publicly
stated, whilst acting as a sly-grog informer
boasted of what he had done in the way of tall
swearing. Again, it has since transpired— and
there are official papers to this effect which have
been carefully suppressed by the authorities—that
Miss Mary Jane Hicks, while in the custody of
a married policeman, gave such proof of her real
character that she had, in consequence, to be re-
moved from his house. But how came “Mr.”
Stanley to be discharged ? Why was he afforded
no opportunity of clearing his character ? Why
was the prosecutor not compelled to attend?
Under the present New South Wales licensing
Act, a publican who, without notice, leaves his
premises for 21 days loses his license, so it would
hi idle for the polica to say they could not have
found this man on whom a forgery had been
passed.
* •
The Bulletin has frequently enquired with-
out effect what became of the money subscribed
to the Stanley Testimonial Fund. The query
has now received a scarfing answer, for on Friday
evening last it was stated in a Sydney daily paper
that the money was paid over to the prosecutor in
order to “ square ” the charge of uttering preferred
against the “hero” Stanley —in other words,
that a public fund was divorced from its original
intention to compound a felony. Which is to say,
that the committee, being bailees of money pub-
licly subscribed to reward valour and heroism,
and other suppositious virtue’, misspent it, and
used it to save an alleged criminal from the dock.
The gift tendered to a deity was debased to sub-
serve the interests of an impenitent thief, to cover
up an offence, and to burke justice ! Such is the
allegation.
* *
But this failure of justice, whether or not resul-
tant on the alleged improper use of the money of
the fund, is only a solitary instance of
many Such failures. Even the crime which in
the case of some of the Mount Rennie offenders
was punished by death may be openly committed
in New South Wales in an aggravated form bj
the powerfully-connected without exciting the
comment of either a venal Press or a dull-minded
public, 1 here are still hundreds of Australians
who remember a case of comparatively recent
occurrence in which a married man, a near rela-
tive of a New fcouth Wales Judge, was charged
on oath by a single woman with having, assisted
by another man, outraged her under circumstances
of peculiar deliberation and atrocity. The
v Oman’s statement was clear and dhtinot, and
the medical evidence conclusive, but the prose-
cutrix, after the case had been brought before the
Court and remanded, was allowed to withdraw
the charge, as she had in the meantime “ had a
conversation with the prisoner’s wife !” Yet, by
a curious coincidence during the very same wee r ,
at Redferu Police Court, a poor woman who hat
been beaten by her husband and wished to with-
draw the charge, was not allowed to do so, but
was deprived of the services and thrashings of hex
bread-whxner for a term of six months. Verily
do circumsta'icrs alter oases in ew South Wales 1
* *
There is a tremendous meaning in the allega-
tion that the Stanley Testimonial Committee,
which numbered among its members Sir Alfred
ST-PHffiSr, Lieutenant-Governor and ex-Chief Jus-
tice of New South Wales, the natural adviser of
the Governor of tin colony on all legal and con-
stitutional points affecting the lives and liberties
of citizens under sentence of death (and who was
probably so consulted on this very Mount
Rennie case) came forward with pub-
licly-subscribed xxxoney given for a defi-
nite purpose, and used it to enable a
notorious law-breaker to e cape the meed of his
offences. This is so stupendous and appalling an
accusation that we must emphatically decline to
believe that Sir Alfred Stephen could ever
have had the barest hint of such proceedings,
which, if they took place at all, must have been
the work of a set of those boobies who are to be
found on every public comini tee. Nor can we for
an instant at ach the slightest ere d't to the amazing
statement that Sir Alfred Stephen and others
“ who still believed in Stanley” (notwithstand-
ing that a felony had, wi'h or without their know-
ledge, been compounded on his behalf !) got up a
subscription among themselves to pay his passage
to England! The thing is grotesquely impossible.
* *
Neverthe’ess, an instant, a full and complete
statement of the manner in which the fund col-
lected on behalf of Stanley was expended Is now
most imperatively demanded. While from one
point of view The Bulletin regrets having
to advert to any phase of the most shameful and
unparalleled miscarriage of justice involved in the
Mount Rennie case, it is in duty bound to point
out that the whole matter must sooner or later
engage the attention of the New South
Wales Parliament with a view to the
rigid future maintenance of those forms of
law which constitute the safeguards placed by
centuries of growing civilisation around the lives
and liberties of British citizens. The community
ruled by the descendants and traditions of the
New South Wales Corps must be taught that a
rape committed on the sightless Goddess of Jus-
tice is an even more heinous crime than the for-
cible further defilement of a common raccrochewee.
The Queensland Liberal Party.
That the Liberal party is thoroughly discredited
in Queensland is manifest. The whole country is
discontented with the administration of affairs,
and this discontent reaches the point of virulence
in the North, which feels it is being resolutely
tied up in the interests of the quid nunes of
Queen-s'reet and the greedy f’outh Between the
North and the South comes what may be called
the dsbateable land—that strip of country which,
in the event of separation, would make up the
border districts of the two colonies. This is more
generally settled with whites than the North, and
its influence in the voting scale is, if not quite
that of the preponderating balance this way or
that way, still very considerable. The belief of
this part of the country is that plantation work is
possible for the whites, but that the rate of wages
they demand from the employers promises no
rapid and colossal fortunes, and that, therefore,
the employers are sedulously propagating the
dogma that the semi-tropics and tropics cannot
be developed without tervile labour. It was the
firm adhesion of this semi tropical Democracy
which, combined with that of the miners, in the
cry of “ Queensland for the Queenslanders,” cul-
minated in the tremendous Liberal victory which
gave Griffith his late dictatorship.
* * *
The general discontent has gained these men
also, as it has gained the other Democracy, the
Democracy of the South and of the Darling
Downs. This discontent has, as yet, had no
mouthpiece. It is general in both its feeling and
its expression, but really, at bottom, it has a
strong element of personal distrust of Griffith.
Why is it, the selecting class is asking itself, that
we obtained better and more practicable terms
from the Land Act of a Oonaervative than from a
Land Act purporting to be drawn up wholly in
our interests ? Groom, like the utterly selfish
time-server he is—Groom, the ex-publican, ex-
stock and station agent, present nigger- minstrel
caterer, and ex-several other things of a more
dubious character, has got out of Griffith what
he wanted—that genera l social. ecognitionof a man
which is supposed to be a sequent prerogative of
the Speakership, Now, therefore, Groom is
getting ready to fan the Darling Dawns discon-
tent, if le sees there is real material for the
flame, and will then once more formulate the price
of his adhesion to the victor of the elections. He
has plajed the game before and won on it, and
he will play it again, he thinks. The squatters,
who hate and scorn him, shall presently see him
cheek by jowl with their representativee in (lie
Council. There is one thing, however, this astute
individual does not calculate on. It is possible
for the Darling Downs Liberals to have a strong
element of pjrsonal distrust of other people
besides Griffith They may have a strong ele-
ment of personal distrust of Groom.
• * *
There remains one section of the voters still to
be taken into account, and it is a most important
one. Jhe urban electorates. These can be divided
into two Casses—the business men (who include
the shopkeepers), and the mechanics (who include
the workmen). The former class is dependent
to the greatest extent on the land, and of all the
Griffithia > failures the land has been the worst.
Randolph Churchill, the other day, was point-
ing out to a Pall Mall Gazette reporter that
the “ education ” Disraeli had given to his party
consisted more in making the town electorates
Tory instead of the shira and country electorates
than in his loud-trumpeted policy of “Im-
perialism.” The truth is, the businesi men every-
where are becoming Toryish without the help of
any “ education ” but their own. And the Queens-
land city business men are profoundly dis-
satisfied with Griffith; and Dickson’s treasurer-
ship has only not ruined his reputation as a
financier through his clever manoeuvre of making
Dutton and his Land Act the so ipegoat, and re-
signing—or ratting—on the force of it.
• »
Ihe Queensland city business men, with their
eyes on the swiftly approaching “ boom, ’ feel
:hat the State finances ought to be administered
oy a man with somewhat larger notions than
fiiose of a parsonical lawyer, backed by Y.M.C. A
log rol ers. They are t rel of hear.ng An stides
for ever called the Just and Griffith the Pure,
The truth la that they begin to sea that
purity, political and otherwise, is a thing to cut
tivate for all it is worth. For, look you, to the
pure all things are pure, and also to hang a dog it
is chiefly necessary to give him a bad name.
Hence it happened that, when M‘llw«aith (who
is a man of wrath and begotten in sin and like-
wise born in it) appointed a friend to a post any.
where, a howl would be raised of bribery and
corruption. But Bam can foist hundreds of his
petty elec’ioneering supporters into the Civil Ser-
vice, and exempt a whole district from an Act,
and it is all right, you know, because he is
Psalmyell the elect, the son of Jbhovah, and his
“ motives are ” (as Cabsar’s wife was not)
“ above suspicion.” That is getting rather thin
now, especially to those on the spot, and the
Queensland business men are coming to see that
Psalmyell’ s “purity” has meant very much
cry and very little wool, in every sense of the
phrase, and would like a taste of the MTl-
wraithian “corruption” now, if only for a
change.
* * *
We have yet to speak of the mechanics and
workmen. Thess were the backbone of the last
elections, the Queenslanders who were for Queen*
land and Bam Griffith and ‘ • pure administra
tlon.” W hat has resulted to them I In what way
has the late Government benefited them ? Every-
where the few struggling manufactories have had
to cljse, a d throw men out cf employment. A
mean, begrudged “ bonus ” and a patch of land
granted to the cotton industry for its first pro-
ducts was just won, and then the industry had to
collapse, while a little larger bonus, continued for
a few more j ears, not to say backed up by a small
import duty to equalise the rate of Kuropean with
Australian wages, would have made the industry
permanent. This was in the depression. In the
approaching “boom” the cotton industry would
have expanded to an incalculable extent, whereas
now the “ boom” comes and goes, and leaves the
country as it was. As it was ? Not quite that,
perhaps; for now—now that, he has played them
false in this way, till his need for their support is
again pressing— Griffith talks of “ protect-
ing native industries ” and reforming the
tariff. When he had overwhelming ma-
jorities, and could have done something
for these men who had given him the place and
power of a dictator, he would do nothing. He
preferred to trick and palter with the squatters
and rich people, their natural foes. He preferred
to shine in the petty social circle. He pre-
ferred to go home and pose in London Tory
“society” as the Queensland dictator, and
air his new-born title, and return with the
’prestige of the British Tory tyranny behind him.
There he could “pledge the honour of the coun-
try ” t>o a ooercionist Premier for a scheme of
Naval Defence which hero he had denounced.
He could do this, and then, when he saw that the
Democracy would be fooled no longer by his
bourgeois, lawyer protestations when he
needed it to once more put him into
place and power—then, and not till then,
he could talk of helping it, of “ protecting native
industries," and not leaving these Queenslanders
(for whom was Queensland) to starve. Is not this
also a trifle thin, my dear friends !
* * *
Every branch of the great and united Liberal
party which rose, Colossus like, from the late
elections, this man has coquetted with and pal-
tered witb. There is no sincerity in him. All he
cares for is himself. It the Democracy uses him,
it must use him as a tool, and a very slippery
tool. 8o far it has been the other way. He has
used the Democracy as the monkey used the eat,
and now anyone can see his pouch full of the
chestnuts which he munches. He wants more.
His chance lies in just this -that, much as the
party distrusts him, it may perhaps distrust his
rival more. Let him not count on that too much.
The MTlwraithian programme is still unuttered.
Let it be a frank declaration of great issues—
Australian Nationalism, and Protection, and good
administration —and Griffith may find himself
once more gnashing his teeth in the outer political
darkness.
After the Celebration.
We have seen tumultuous revel, we have seen
ecstatic display. We have heard wonderful
speeohmaking, and suffered exquisite headaches
from innumerable banquets, feastings, and cor-
roborees. And what does it amount to ? Nothing.
The day just celebrated has been the anniver-
sary—for the hundredth time repeated—of the
settlement of these lands by England. What is
there therein that we should rejoice ?
* • *
Our Fatherland I Perhaps somewhat less than
a third of our fathers found their origin there—
another part in the land of the gallant fects—yet
another in that section which England cruelly and
barbarously oppresses—the enslaved and down-
trodden Ireland. The statistics may show some-
what differently, but of those who left for Aus-
tralia from an English birthplace, how many, in-
deed, owed their blood to the steadfast men from
the freer and braver clime of the North or to the
dashk grace from the isle of the West? Is it
not from theie that England’s own failing bleod
has been recruited for the past five generations ?
And why did those emigrants, who freely and
voluntarily took np their lot in a land which Eng-
land had stigmatised with the badge of crime
(albeit England’s self could not escape the just
sentence for the greater crime of judicially en-
slaving, nay, even murdering and degrading in
still worss degree some of these alleged criminals,
were a Dav of Judgment to be at this moment
pronounced upon the nations)—why did they take
up their lot in the outcast land ? Was It not be-
cause they sought to escape from the domineering
tyranny of England—of the whole English system
—for seeking to amend which, on the same basis
as we in Australia enjoy to day, Chartists and
other carnest-souled reformers had been crimi-
nalized ? The flag of the nation which
enslaved these our pioneers came flaunting its
vile ignominy to anticipate their path, and shut
them out from the freedom of a new world just)
as it is now menacing and undermining their
liberties; and for this we are called upon
to reioioe Rather should we mourn that
the new and better world was not left to
itself; that its founders could nob at once
proclaim the Australian freedom—the nation’s
life that shall sooner or later vitalize the world—
at onoe upon their landing ; that those con-
demned to the chains and the lash for a disregard
of the iniquitous claims of landlordism and
monopoly could not Mien leaped to liberty,
and proclaimed the overthrew here at least of the
monster whin degraded them. And that it was


not so do we not to-day reap the most bitter
flrstfruita ? And what shall it be when the deadly
harvest is ripe ?
• • *
After so many years of comparative freedom
what do we And? A servile imitation of Eng-
land in our Courts of Law—a toadying worship of
England’s thieves fostered by the English mer-
chants among us who would be squires them-
selves —an imperial conspiracy which, as we long
ago pointed out, has for its object the utter
shelving of all questions of Australian interest—
the subjection of these lands to English naval and
military forces—and the cutting off of local pos-
sibilities of advancement, that, by personal ambi-
tion, the warlike of our population may be bribed
to seek their interests in an adherence to the
dominance —the soldier-sway—of England!
• • •
Eight glad is T«e Bulletin to see that its
hints have been taken up in earnest. When in
these columns was published a poem on the signi-
ficance of England’s refusal to participate in the
French Exhibition, we then, under the pressure
of feeling against France owing to her convict
settlements in the Pacific, stood alone. We had
pointed out how France was j ustifled in her action
so long as these colonies failed to make their
principles known— so long as they were content
to stand in the eyes of the world as a mere append-
age of England, used as a convenience for fur-
nishing her aristocracy with snug Governorships,
and for sending squeamishly loyal addresses to
the stingy woman who rolls ia wealth while the
millions starve. To-day the same note has been
struck far and wide. The leading Conservative
journals are wasting tons of ink in vain endea-
vours to controvert the daily-repeated truth. We
are sincerely thankful that our warning has not
been in vain, and that it has found a responsive
echo far and wide. But it is more than argu-
ment we seek for. It is well to know that the
Imperial octopus has its myriad tentacles out-
spread threatening directly or indirectly all that
is worth having of distinctively Australian life.
But more yet is necessary.

To the notice of the Australian Natives’ Asso-
ciation, to whose Dunolly Branch in Victoria the
idea of the present holiday on each successive
anniversary is due, we commend these words, as
well as to Australians throughout the length and
breadth of the land. Let a day be set apart to
commemorate the anniversary of Australian
self-government —the day on which, with Wes-
tern Australia, the whole continent becomes
to some extent free—let that be celebrated as
the birthday of a United Nation, as it must
come to be—and thus fostering the spirit of
liberty and national Independence, we shall be
content to let the wretched advent of crime and
oppression go by the board, unremembered and
uncommemorated. The time is at hand to mark
our desise of impressing on our annals the record
of Australian autonomy, and unless (which onr
patriotism forbid !) we are to look upon self-rule
as a mere machine for elevating a few
Duncans and Sir ’Enerys to the rank of demi-
gods, and as nought else besides, we should
hasten to express our delight at the completion of
one step in the direction of full Australian free-
dom, independence, manhood, responsible power,
and foremost Right. If we are afraid, or ashamed,
to mark this important epoch in our history, we
may as well cease the boast of our leading posi-
tion in the army of Progress, and go and squat
ignominiously in the enemy’s rear. Let us awake
to a sense of onr position, for the days are surely
not far ahead when, in the deadly convulsions
that shall shake the world, our principles and onr
courage will be put to the test.
“Death and Co."—A Profitable
Partnership.
Thebe is something new under the sun, spite of
all that Solomon said about it. Until lately no
company of a commercial character started busi-
ness with Death as their sole resource and work-
ing partner. Azrakl has, however, been found
so profitable in this character that no loss than
four other companies have been, in Melbourne,
imitatively floated with Death as their sole sup-
port in business. It is something alarming to go
into partnership with Death, but those have done
so who took shares years ago in the Trustees and
Executors’ Company. It might never have been
started had not Black Wednesday and its results
given Mr. Templeton, the veteran police-magis-
trate, freedom from the Bench. He left dealing
with Justice, which sometimes miscarries in this
world, to deal with the inevitable which never
does. He had seen the uncertainty of things in
so many ways that he took up with what is com-
monly quoted as one of the two “ certainties ” of
this life—the two being Death and Quarter Day.
* * *
And how the world—the commercial world—
has long overlooked such a profitable partner as
Death proves to be 1 Day .and night he —to give
Azrakl a masculine character —works unceas-
ingly—no sleeping partner is he. And what aid
he has from all around ! Intemperance, over-
work, miasma, idleness, doctors’ mistakes, rail-
way accidents, feve s, and diseases of all kinds
All bring grist to the mill, end charge no commis-
sion to the company. All aid Death, the working
partner, who brings all the profits and yet takes
no share of them.

Life-assurance companies have been found good
joint-stock enterprises, but they are nothing in
their profitable nature to our death-assurance one.
It receives instead of paying whe i a death occurs.
The Life A ssurance gets but a paltry part during
•life, while the 'trustees and Executors Company
take over everything at death —the amount oC
life assurance included. And then, when death
f has brought in all this property, how certain is
that possession of it which is said to be nine points
out of ten in favour of the holder ! The banks
■can tell how much remains in their chests of what
comes to ihem. The Court of Chancery can show,
also, long lists of unclaimed property, and so the
Trustees and Executors’ Company will have care-
fully to see that only right claimants, when they
come, take what is due to them, and that on pro-
duction only of all proper proof. Why was Death
never thought of before as a partner except by
the undertaker? Why have we gone boggling
■along appointing friends as our Trustees and
Executors who might die before us or not keep
their promises—when we no longer remained
to see them go back on their word ? They
flj that in six cases out of every 12, and so let
their duties devolve upon incapable people. When
these friends of the deceased did act it has been
mostly through their lawyers, the result being
‘heavy bills of coats to be paid by the estate.
These Executors and Trustees Companies are
goed things—as proved by the numbers who avail
themselves of such service. The Company never
dies or emigrates or goes bankrupt—so necos-
*Bitating changes and letting loss fall upon
the widow and orphans. Slow Sydney has
not yet got an Act of Parliament passed
empowering its one company to act, while
Victoria has five legally empowered ones in full
blast In Melbourne, one also at Ballarat and one
at Sandhurst. In the first "Melbourne one (rhe
Trustees, Executors, and Agency Co ) the shares
stand at £7 10s. on £1 paid up and the dividend is
25 per cent! But that is nothing to one of such
companies established at Cape of Good Hope, in
which the £lO shares now sell at £750 each 1 !

Let Is Stamp Chinese Goods.
An Act which savours somewhat of Protection
came into force in England last month. This
Act provides that no foreign-made stuffs shall
pass the Customs unless they bear labels boldly
marked “German,” “French,” or “Italian”
manufacture, as the case may be. Moreover, the
Customs officers are empowered to enter any
warehouse for the purpose of satisfying themselves
that all Continental fabrics bear a distinguishing
mark. At latest dates, London warehousemen
and agents were considerably agitated on this
subject, and German exporters (at whom the Act
is chiefly directed) were endeavouring to arrange
a test case in the Law Courts. French manu-
facturers, on the other hand, hare every-
thing to gain from the operation of the Act,
as German silk is habitually palmed off
upon retail purchasers as the original Lyons
article. The names of Bonnet, Jaubskt, and
others are household words with all English
women who can afford the orthodox “ black silk,”
while any other than a French merino couldn’t
find a sale. But there are no recognised popular
mat: 63 of German goods in silk or wool, although
they flood the English markets, hence the new
Act, c n the face of it, seems to have been framed
in the interests of English and (in a minor degree)
of French manufacturers. Considering the dis-
tinctly Protective character of this innovation, it
is strange that the cable has been silent about it,
aid even more strange that the Victorians
have not yet “ spotted ” such a favourable
opportunity for exultation. Not so long
ago their local Freetraders were denouncing
the injustice of compelling Chinese-made furni-
ture to be stamped. It was “ un-English,” “ un-
generous,” “ un-Christian-like,” and a few other
things. Now we have the Salisbury Govern-
ment going one better than the Victorian by
ordering all goods of alien origin to be labelled
for the information of private purchasers. If the
English public loyally take this broad hint and
demand home-made materials at the shops (always
excepting certain French specialities) they will
enjoy Protection without a Tariff.
The Sew South Wales Public Works Bill.
The Public Works Bill so laboriously built up by
Sir Henry Pahkks and his colleagues is drifting
through the New South Wales Assembly with
comparatively little display of interest on either
side. It shows in every clause the imbecility of
its originators, and it is hardly possible to imagine
that any band of human mediocrities could pos-
sibly have drafted a weaker measure to cope with
- a stupendous evil. For many years, the Public
Works system of New South Wales has been
honeycombed with corruption and fraud. Rail-
ways, which will never pay within the lifetime of
any living Australian, have been built in places
where there is no prospect of traffic, to bring the
property of influential politicians within reach of
civilisation ; bridges have been constructed where
there is no water, and dams have been excavated
alongside permanent streams, and a chronic sys-
tem of warfare between the Barnacles and the
Stiltstalkings of various highly-paid Depart-
ments has swamped hundreds of thousands of
public money, which it was nobody’s business to
save. In the Assembly, almost every member is
a son of the horse-leech who wants public money
in one form or another —money for his
constituents in order to make his calling and xe
election sure, money for himself and for his j
brothers and sons and uncles, money in the shape
of roads and railway deviations through his own
property, and the property of his father and his
grandfather and all thereat of hi* ancestors, money
in any shape and to any amount, from a cheap ,
lease of half a million acres of the public estate
down to a vote for the erection of a hog-tr.ough
painted blue outside his hotel And at last the colony
has been forced to the conclusion that all these
things are vanity, and that the entire Public Works
system must be removed from the region of poli-
tics and based for the future on purely commercial
principles. In Victoria this has been done by
leaving local improvements to lie constructed by
local bodies at the expense pf the districts which
are benefited by them, and by placing the railways
under the charge of a Board of business men
whose one pre-eminent duty it is to make them
yield a fair rate of dividend. Sir Henry Parkes, ;
however, proposes to arrive, at the same result by
a different road. Hitherto the construction of !
public works in New South Wales has ,been bossed
by a,committee of about 120 more or less—chiefly
more —corrupt politicians, each anxious to secure
the largest possible share of the plunder, but
under the new system these 120 men, who
have been trie ( d and found unworthy of
their trnst, are to elect eight of their own
number, who are no better than the rest, to sit
on a committee, and this body, supplemented by
five members of the Upper House, who are irre-
moveable and responsible to no one for their actions,
will decide on the construction of works wherever
they promise to yield the largest amount of ad-
vantage to themselves in the first place, and to the
country in the second. According to the theory
of Sir Henry Parkes, although the Assembly is
morasly unfit to bo permitted to openly scramble
for concessions at the expense of the nation, it is
eminently fitted to elect a certain number of its
own discredited members to scramble for them in
secret; but the committee having, like the As-
sembly, nothing to lose by passing, for private
ends, jobs that will pay no dividends, the ultimate
result promises to be much the same as before.
Finally, when the committee has done its work,
its recommendations will be reviewed in a grand
struggle of the whole House, and they will also be
subject to the Inspection of the Ministers, who, as
heretofore, will anxiously consider how their own
interests are concerned. This, final act of super-
vision, however, will be almost superfluous.
Hitherto it has been a cold day when a new rail-
way was constructed which d'd not run
through the property of at least three
members of the Government of the day,
and as the new committee will be elected
by the majority in the Assembly—or in o her
words, by the followers of the Mini try of the daj,
and aj the said following will vote for the nomi-
nees of the Government, it will naturally follow
.hat the chosen eight will be men on whose sympa-
thies the Government can rely. Now and then, pos-
sibly, a concession will have to be made to the
five fossils from the Upper Mausoleum, but, as a
rule, they will be readily voted down by the dead
weight of their colleagues, or else induced to com-
promise, and the jobs which have hitherto been
perpetrated in the light of day will now be put
dirough with celerity and despatch in the twilight
of the committee-room. The new Public Works
Bill is a measure which promises well to aggravate
he dire corruption of the past and to make con-
fusion worse confounded, and in this respect it is
a fair sample of the reforms which mark the track
of Henry Parkbs through the enduring Statute
Book of New South Wales,
John Van Haynes : An Australian Political
Study.
On 31st January, 1886, Mr. John Haynes, who
then possessed something which he imagined to
be a newspaper, wrote the attached diatribe
against a hoary sham called Parkbs, who now,
as Premier, bosses the political affairs of New
South Wa’es, A few months after writlrg it, he
commenced to grovel at the feet of the same
Parkbs, and is gravelling there yet. A semi-
illiterate shoemaker, named Abigail, who, though
a New South Wales Minister of the Crown, helps
to run a pawnshop called the “ Australian Bank-
ing Company,” where working men are charged
from 60 to 200 per cent on convertible securities,
is the other individual alluded to. We are care-
ful to mention this because Haynes and Abigail
now run the election business together, in place of
hitting each other on the head with a boo*~, which
latter would he the most reasonable thing for
them to do, considering how recently they de-
scribed each other as something lower than a
stolen ass, and, consequently, the public might
naturally imagine that it was another Haynes
and quite a different Abigail. The trio now form
the principal part of the New Holland party—so
called because it attempts to run New South
Wales on the resurrected ghost of old Dutch
William— and it is, therefore, interesting to note
the sentiments of these gentlemen towards each
other. Haynes speaks—the old Haynfs, not the
new one:
People who have been reading this paper will have noticed
how we've for months steadily held to the assertion that Sir
Henry Parkis was fast declining in intellectual vigour.
We showed repeatedly that since his physical breas-up,
prior to his last trip to England, he has blundered in a way
to cast a gloom over all the political work of his vigorous
days.
And now we have proof again, proof every day, in fact,
that the man is in the evening twilight of his political exist-
ence.
Only recently he presided at a Salvation Army inaugura-
tion ; and a few days ago we beheld him presiding over a
Woman’s Holy Temperance Meeting; and Mr. Nobles
goody-goody gathering of sun-dried abstainers.
Now we have him accepted as the Parliamentary represen-
tative of good, hut senseless, old ladies who pray for the
shutting of all theatres on Sunday.
And, as if to show that the aforesaid old and pious dames
were not mistaken in their estimate of the man, the pious
old war-horse has intimated his intention of asking Parlia-
ment to embody the women’s petition in a vigorous law.
Does any eme man in this community want farther < vi-
dence of the galloping con sumption i f tin brain which affects
Sir Henry Paekks?
We laugh at his irapotenoy in attempting to close the
theatres ontheSundav evenings; if he fights the battle it
will show what a hopeless minority there is in our Parlia-
ment with a religious gizzard.
Sir Henry Parkes, months ago, was run into the politi-
cal gutter for his narrow-minded treatment of Proctor, the
scientist.
And from that day he has never shown the whites of his
eyes from the steps of the Colonial Secretary’s office.
True, he has ever since been turning up his eyes, and true
it is that their whites have been reflected in the ssd and sal-
low, drawn and tightened, face of the hapless A»igail. But
that s all.
No. This country has burst the thongs of the tom-tom
beaters.
Sydney sends to the theatres on the Sunday evening ten
people to the one she sends to the churches.
The pioans of man’s eternal suffering in the depths of Hell
are drowned by the merry strains of woman’s melodious
voice and i he inspiriting sounds of music that kindle hope
and elevate the mind
Man is rising to he free. No more will ghouls point to a
black and hideous doom, and hold up to man’s distorted
vision a golden harp that is but as vapoury as the shadow on
the wall.
Millions cf such men as Parkbs are dead and rotting in
the grave. Are live men and a young country to dive into a
ooffiu and bring forth as a leader a creature that a been the
home of worms for ages ?
No !’
This burst is a feeble imitation of that great
American legal luminary who opened a case with
the impassioned cry : “ Gentlemen, at this period
of darkness and gloom, when Europe stands on
the verge of an abyss and the demons of war and
discord are let loose on the fair face of the earth,
I rise with due diffidence to defend this humble
hog-thief.” It is a weird mixture of Parkes and
Sheol; the “pseans” of eternal perdition are
hitched on to the question of onening the theatres
on Sunday, and the great Hi-Ham is accused,
amid a cataract of battered figures of speech, of
having been partly eaten by worms be cans 3 he
was endeavouring, it seems, to hold up a golden
harp to man’s distorted vision when there wasn’t
any harp there at all. Still the above is Van
Haynes’ unbiassed opinion of Van Parkes. Van
Parkbs’ opinion of Van Haynes is that he
“doesn’t want either his support or his acquaint-
ance,” which is about equivalent to saying
“take the animal away,” and Van Abigail’s
opinion of the pair probably is that his
“ bank ” wouldn’t lend them anything
without good “shecurity.” Yet they all fight
together in the grand old cause of Imperial grovel,
and the ghost of Dutch William leads a happy
family in the great crusade for a Government
billet with a good screw attached.
“ When the World becomes more Civilised.”
Judge Murray, of New fcouth M ales, is a citizen
of copious vocabulary and possesses a lot of style.
Also, he is a whale on human ty and a credit to a
civilised community, and has a large number of
morals to the equara yard. The oth r day he was
sentencing a man at Armidale to five years’ and
25 lashes, and he spread himself over the case and
tore round it, and heaved the deceased cats of
sentiment and the decaying goats cf rhetoric at
the prisoner in the following fashion, as reported
by the local paper :
I only regret that I cannot punish you in a way that would
be even greater than death—greater than life-imprisonment;
hut through absurd sentimentality on the tart rf our legisla-
tors I cannot do this. No doubt the time will arrive—when the
world becomes more civilised—that such hideous, disgusting
crimes will be punished in the manner I have sugsested.
Sensible people will know what I mean by this .
We have our doubts concerning that last assertion,
and we would urge Judge Murray not to speak
for a class of people whom he knows nothing
about. ‘ ‘ Sensible people ” will readily compre-
hend that the genial Judge is howling on the
Bench because he hasn’t authority to commit
some atrocity which would make a Hottentot
shudder beneath his life-long crust of grease and
dirt, but what kind of sickening barbarity be
wants to perpetrate he is apparently ashamed to
explain. Possibly he wants to boil the prisoner
slowly and deliberately, and then sentence him to
imprisonment for life on top of it. Perhaps he
would like to roast him over a gentle Are, and then
:ake him off when he is half done, and baste
bim with tint tore of cayenne and sulphuric acid,
and crucify him, and have him taken down
when he has been cruo’fled for an hour
or so, and cut his feet off, and then
save him flogged. Or maybe he would
iike to revert to that grand old Tartar scheme of
cutting a man in two and planting the upper half
of him on a red-hot stove —a humorous dodge by
which part of a man could be kept alive for half-
sn-hour or so after the rest of him was dead.
Or, again, the idea which he wants “ sen-
sible people” to citch on to may be that
of a certain Russian Czar who dislocated
all a prisoner’s limbs and then put him
in an oven, cr he may yearn for the
Moorish device by which a man’s bands and feet
were mashed to a pulp with sledge-hammers, after
which he was turned loose to crawl through the
balance of existence on his knees and elbows.
If Judge Murray is not utterly ashamed of the
particular plan of mutilation which he longs for
be might as well explain himself more fully next
time. It is a very inferior kind of barbarian
who, through a piece of “ absurd sentimentality, ’
can’t screw up his courage to define his own
theories, and as the judge reckons that his own
special atrocity will come into favour when the
world becomes more civilised he might as well
assist the march of that approaching civilisation
by lecturing on the enlightened hidecusness of
the future, and by putting in a diagram or two to
illustrate the way it is to be done. As a sort of
postscript we would suggest the Chinese “ ling-
chi ’ as an arrangement which ought to be satis-
factory to all parties. It is simple and amusing,
and consists in cutting slices off a lire prisoner
until there is very little left of him. Will his
alleged Honor kindly state whether this will suit ?

Why the Workman Is a Socialist.
This, from the latest i-'sue of Lloyd’s, is the kird
of thing we are eternally finding in the English
papers:—
DIE RATHER THAN SEPARATE
Mr. Cabttak held an itqueat at the City Arms, Deptford,
on Wednesday, on the body of Thomas Ansell, aged 81.
of Griffin-street, Deptford. Ann Ansell, aged 77, said
deceased was her husband, and they lived in a furnished room.
They had 3s 61, a week from the parish, out of which tin y
paid 2s. lent. They had nothing else to live upon She used
to go out with a basket and laces, but r hawkers license
expired six months ago, and she could not raise 5s to renew
it. Deceased, who was taken ill about a fortnight ago, had
not left ihe house for 12 months. It was arranged they
should go into the workhouse on Tuesday. On Bnxing Day,
however, she got out of bed to get him a cup of tea, and
then he “closed his poor dear eyes,” and she sent for a
neighbour. All she had v as a cup of tea and a piece of b:ead.
Her husband had said if he went into the workhouse he
would not live a week. The relieving offhe' had never sug-
gested that the deceased should go there. She intended to
enter Greenwich Union Infirmary now, but not before the
funeral. On Christines Day she had a little meat given to
her, but had had very little filing last week. She owed no
rent. Mrs. Murphy, the landlady of the house, said that
she let the room furnished, and reduced the rent from 3a. to
2i. The wife worked herd with her basket, but, being very
feeble, did net seil much. Ansell had told witness that if
he and his wife could be together, they would go into the
“ house '• but if they could not they would die together.
The wife was very devoted to the deceased Mr. Pilcher,
relieving officer, stated that he had told An.sell he would
be bitter rff in the workhouse but he would not listen to
it. There were wards at the bouse for old married
couples, but they were not kept together if one was
sick. He did not tell deceased he could be with his
wife ia the workhouse. A juryman said 19 out of 20
would not enter the house for fear of being separated
at the door. Police-constable Woodinhs, coroners officer,
declared on opening the door of the room that the stench
was dreadful, and he had the window opened before enter-
ing. He found Ansell lying on the bed terribly emaciated,
and concluded that it wrs ao*se of starvation. The coroner
said it appeared tohim that the case was one of shier desti-
tution and starvation, and the old man would not enter the
workhouse for fear of being separated from his wife. Mr.
Pender, a Juryman, said that Ansell had toll him that
sooner than enter the workhouse and be separated from his
wife he would die on the doorstep, be (Mr Pender) had
been ill through going into the room. The i nly food he
ever saw there was dry bread, with a little dripping, perhaps
a herring, and in season a pennyworth of sprats between the
old couple. They were married whea the wife was 21 (56
years ago)! The jury returned a verdict of “Death from
decay of nature, death being accelerated by the want of
sufficient nourishment.’'

But one and all if they would dusk the day.
We asked them for a life of toilsome earning,
They b ide us bide their leisure for our bread.
We craved to speak to tell our woeful learning,
We come back speechless, bearing back our dead.
Not one, &o.
They will not learn ; they have no ears to hearken.
Tney turn their faces from the eyes of fate;
Their gay-lit halls shut out the skies that darken.
But, lo ! this dead man knocking at the gate.
Not one, &c.
Here lies the sign that we shall break our prison;

But one and all if they would dusk the day.
Mr. Z. C. Barry, the happy owner of 210 shares
in the now notorious Gold Hill (N.S. W.) mine,
seems an unfortunate specimen of the lamb on the
stock exchange. Now that the bottom has to a
considerable extent fallen out of the enterprise in
which his hopes wore embarked, he admits that
he was loosing for five tons of gold r’ght off, and
expected to see about 100 bullocks bringing down
the first cake in a big tank, amid the hoorays of
the excited populace. Someone at the mine
pointed out to him two tanks which, he said, con-
tained 10 tons of quartz, “half of it being pure
gold,” and Z.O. figured out from this that there
was something near £1,000,000 to the good before
the mine was fairly opened. At a banquet which
was held on the same auspicious occasion one of
the speakers exp-essed a firm conviction that
there was 10 hundredweight of gold on hand,
but Mr. Barry reckoned that he had seen four
or five tons himself, and concluded that the
speaker didn’t know what he was talaicg about.
Somebody also stuffed Mr. Barry w r ith the idea
tint the manager was so much overwhelmed by
1 his stupendous wealth that he declined to crush
the material except in the presence of the direc-
tors and legal manager, fearing that £250,000
worth or so might be mislaid, and that he might
be blamed for the loss, hinally, eight months
work brought out a total of 100 oz, which has
made Mr. Barry sit up. Probably when he
has had a larger experience of gold mining
he may take things a little more calmly. The
present writer has individually owned more than
one mine that promised as well as poor Barry’s
busted vision, and he had to get away by the
dirt road on foot for want of money to pay for the
loan of a glandered nag to facilitate his retreat.
Mr. Barry would do well to make a note of this
circumstance in the days of his youth, for if he
takes a hand in a few more five-ton enterprises
the chances are that when old age comes upon
him he won’t hi able to pay for coali.


Parkes ia a Mandarin—a mandarin
Orangeman.
HISTORT OF BOTANY BAY,
There were many privileged ruffians in
early New South Wales, but none so richly de-
serve to be tieh up to the L iangles ot history and
flogged with tha “cat” of hoaost criticism as
Captain John Macarthur. He was one of our
first merchants—such merchants as the officers of
the New South Wales Corps were. Ha w- s the
founder of ths squatting order - bit his public
thefts were nob confined to the public lands. He
was the originator of the wool growing industry
But John Macarthur was a gret-t deal besides all
that. “De mortuis nil nisi bonum,” says some-
one ; but the last word is an error. It should read
“ vtrum ” instead,
* * *
Inasmuch as he opened up the wool-grow-
ing industry ho did good work. But it paid him,
To ere was no mawkish phiia-ithropy about John
Macarthur. He was as rapacious as a jackal,
and as emotionless and cold as an oyster. There-
fore his proj sets prospered well- He grew wool
just as he sold rum—to make money. He made
io ; but the persons who have written Australian
history want to make him a hero and a patriot as
we l. He was a patriot Bat it was of the Aus-
tralian brand And the Australian brand has
certain distinctive features which mate io pecu-
liar to Australia. Those who arc ignorant of
what these distinctive fe atur, a ora may glean a
fair idea by noting the char icteristics of this
worthy Captain John Macarthur. All our patriots
have a family resemblance. We will mrk this
one with the lash as he h- ngs by the wrists at the
triangles of history, so that you may know the
type when you meet it in Australian public life,
or in these pages again.
* # *
Macarthur was about 20 years of age when
he came to Bobany Bay as Paymaster and Liau-
tenant in the Corps, with the first division that
reached the settlement. If there was any doubt
as to the motive that brought his confederates to
Australia, there was never any about what
brought him. He came to make money, and he
made it. When the “ rum-selling corps ” was in
action, he was always in the van. His hand was
in everything that was going. The Corps put
him forward as its representative, and he fought
for their privilege to rob and defraud the soldier
and the convict, and called his action a defence of
the popular rights. He harassed the successive
Governors, and boasted of having procured the
recall of every one of them up to Macquarie. He
helped to chase Phillip out of the country, and,
when Hunter came, he persecuted that unhappy
person so far that he had to appeal to the Home
Government against him. “ I consider this offi-
cer’s conduct to be an impertinent, indiscreet,
and highly censurable interference with the duties
and department of the Governor,” he wrote, when
Macarthur went home to work up a feeling
against him there. When Kitg came he made
himself as obnoxious as befera, and scarcely
allowed that good sea-captain time to flog his
woman-convicts. This exasperated King very
much, and he stated his views in certain lurid
minutes to his superiors, ending with the words,
“ Should any further proof be wanting of the tur-
bulent and restless character of Captain Mac
arthur, 1 must require that the evidence of the
late Governors Phillip and Hunter may be pro-
cured. ”
• • •
Whoever opposed the nefarious proceed-
ings of the Corps came in for his unscrupulous
attacks. He had his faction amongst the settlers,
and to those who did not belong to It his name
was a cause of undisguised terror. When Judge
Advocate Atkins was not Intoxicated, he was
quarrelling with Macarthur, too. and some pretty
squabbles were the result. They took action for
libel against each other, but dropped them
promptly, doubtless for excellent reasons on both
sides. When the magistrate. Dr. Balmain, re-
fused to play into the hands of the Corps they
persecuted him, too, and Macarthur was singular
for the cunning yet shameless way in which ha
slandered the magistrate ; who replied, “ that he
would maintain tohla las , breath the character of
a gentleman, in defiance of every unmanly mode
of detraction that Mr, Macarthur is capable of
using.” When the jackals of the Corps began to
quarrel amongst themselves over the boms they
stole, Macarthur. of course, was in the thick of
the scramble. Captain Abbott, of the Corps, said
something quaint about Governor King, and
Lieutenant Marshall, of the Navy, whose proud
soul revolted at this Insult to another naval officer
from a squalid captain of this unsavoury body,
pleasantly signified his sentiments by pulling Cap-
tain Abbott's nose. They fought duels on Garden
Island in those days ; but Captain Abbott didn’t.
He thought it safer to bring a civil action Colonel
Paterson—a not unworthy officer, though in very
bad company—could not help sympathising with
Marshall. The irrepressible Macarthur there-
upon picked a quarrel with his officer, and chal
longed him to a duel. Then the Governor got dis-
gusted with the whole miserable business, and
sent Macarthur home under arrest. But he soon
came back. There was no scope for talents like
his out of a convict colony.
Why did Macarthur come into such fre-
quent conflict with the Governor and other
officials ? Simply because ha had the largest
stake In the trading operations of the Corps as
already described. He and his accomplices wera
making fortunes out of the cruelly-forced con-
vict labour, the open fraud and extortion prac-
tised on tha soldiers and settlers, and the control
and monopoly of that criminal traffic In ram which
turned the early settlement into a Pandamtmium.
It has been said that Macarthur treated his
assigned convict servants well. If he did it was
for the re urn their prison-labour might produce
him. But, fortunately, we have an explicit re-
cord bearing indirectly on this matter, which
fairly states his g md intentions for what they wera
wor h. Macarthur made a public-spirited pro-
posal to Governor Hamer to reli va him of the
care of a number of convlc s by taking thsm to
work for him. He took great credit for his
generosity in offering bread-rats for their labour.
Hunter looked up his pocket-grammar, and fixed
the patriot neatly, thus : “ Ths daily wages of a
labouring man, without furnishing food, was, at
that time. ss. or sunethlng more, and the price of
bread was about 2ji. per lb. Supposing a man to
receive two poundi a day, t at would amount to
5d.; for this might? savi >g to Government of 51,
he would have g i ei 5s in labour.” So Mr
M carthur's be evidence was b igh'od; and
nothing is here apparent to show why ula turn an
the triangles of history should be abridged by so
much as a single lash.
* # *
It was part of the plan of these officers,
and of Macarthur as their spokesman, to oppose
every measure for the amelioration of the con-
victs' lot. To secure their own ascendancy they
put forward every effort to crush the emancipated
prisoners. When a proposal was made to establish
them on small farms, so that they might have an
opportunity of living honestly by their own labour,
he vehemently opposed tha project of giving land
to what he called tha “idle, worthless poor,”
whom he said should be “ obliged to employ them-
selves In the service of an industrious and vigi-
lant master”—assisted by a fligger, ooubtless.
For the same reason, respectable settlers with
capital, coming to the country, were opposed and
persecuted. Two such men, named Ellis and
Boston, firmly but in guarded language ventured
to protest against the exclusive monopoly claimed
by iha officers, of all trade and business. “ This
irritated the whole governing despotic power of
the settlement against them,” wrote Palmar, one
of the Scotch Martyrs; “ they were refused a
grant of land and servants, and never employed.”
Bat Hunter relieved them from their disabilities
when ha arrived, and iha two men afterwards
prospered In business, and became waaithy. But
It is time to out John Macarthur down, and let
him go howling away until wa want him again.

Margarot’s evidence was given before tha
Committee of the Commons in 1812 It describes
tha state of things tha : lad up co the Bligh fiasco.
In answer to question* he said, on oath, tsiac the
morals and conduc of oonvlc s were n ;t improved
at Botany Bay, owin? to tha officers who were
sent out there. To cheir trado, in which they had
engaged “to a man,’’ and personal ignorance
alone he attributed their behaviour, which he
described as barbarous and cm el in the extreme.
“ Their trade,” ho said, “consists first of mono-
poly, and then of extortion; it includes all
the necessaries of life which are brought to
the colony.” The trade is thus described:
“ When a ship has arrived, and the goods
have been landed in tha King’s stores,
after a few days the stores aro opened to the
officers, who go in, lay their hands on everything
of value, and have their names afflxad to it as
purchasers, and they leave nothing but the refuse
for the colony ; having done so by themselves or
by their agents, they retail that, as I have said
before, at 500 per cent, profit.” Other state moats
make the profit run up to 1500 percent. “If
you offended one officer,” continued Mr. Margaret,
“ you offended the whole ; and any poor prisoner
that had the misfortune to offend any one officer,
would be sure to get a flogging from some other.”
Such was the state of the colony when Governor
Out-
Lieutenant Marshall signified his sentiments by pulling Captain Abbott’s nose.
Bligh arrived. He cams with instructions to pat
a stop as far as was possible to the traffic in
liquor, and to curtail au i check the preceding a
of the officers of tha Ne w South Wales Corps. It
was a perilous mission, for the officers had had
everything their own way for many years, and
their power and interests were by this time con-
solidated. In the light of these facts, what comss
after will ba more raadily understood.
* • •
No one has ever ventured to deny that
Bligh was a brave man, except the gallant officers
of the Corps. They were not the best judges of
courage and gallantry, but they said they cap-
tured the Governor under a bed. Bligh’s record
saems to give this statement the lie, but not more
emphatically than the character of those who
made it. He was famous before he came to the
colony. The story of the mutiny of the Bounty
has been often told, and there is little need to re-
peat here how his crew rose in insubordination,
captured the vessel, and set Bligh and his offleara
afloat in an open boat on the wide Pacific ; how
he sailed 3500 miles, and was saved, while the
mutineers colonised Pitcairn’s Island in their own
way. Bligh had also been involved in the mutiny
at t b e Nore. He had been twice court- mar Bailed,
and censured once for intf nsparate language. He
sailed with Captain Cook for four years in tha
Roso’ution. He fought under Admirals Hiwe
and Parker. He foaght at Oopenh »gt n under
Nelson, and was publicly thanked on the quarter-
deck by the great commander after the engage-
ment. He gave up the command of a 72 gan
shi )to come to New South Woles. From all this
it will be seen that he had a high character for
bravery and gorfi service, but also a reputation
for hasty temper and high spirit. This kiod of
man was not cunning or mean enough to have
any chance in the etc filet with tha officers of the
Corps, They saw his weak points, and attacked
them. They made his two court-martials and his
censure for intern Derate language their oppor-
tunity, and they roli id'on this part of his record
as their justification for the vile conspiracy into
which they ent rad in the interests ot their own
selfish rapacity and dishonest trade. Here, egain,
Mr. Macarthur co es to the front. An oppor-
tunity row offered for the play of those sinister
lalcn sin which he recall ly excelled. We must
tie him up to the triang es t gain.
A New Misery.
The Parkes Ministry has made a cheap bid for
the support of the Sydney Morning Herald.
For some time back that ponderous pillar of the
cause has shown signs of falling away from grace
—and Parkes- and it was therefore considered
advisable to make an effort to bring it back to the
fold. Consaquently, the following circular was
sent out to afl the schools in New South Wales
as a fitting conclusion to the Centenary re-
joic'ngs :
The Minister of Public Instruction has authorised the
transmission to every school under this Department of a
c my at tha Centenary Number of the Sydney Morning
Herald of this o’ate, which contains a special supplement
dealing with tha progr-ss of Australian settlement, together
with maps of New South Wales, Australia, &o The news-
paper will be forwarded to y u from the Herald offica. It
is desired that you will make known the contents of the
an iales to such pupils of the school under your charge as are
capable of understanding them, and that you will make the
best use posable of the maps.
The hideous cruelty of this move can only be
understood by a man who has devoted himself
to a prayerful study of the Herald, There are
few who. can comprehend that paper—fewer still
who can stand a proloi ged acquaintance with it
It is too undermining to the mental faculties.
Even when the Herald merely attempts to con-
vey the information that one drunk was fined 5a,,
it does it in a way that petrifies the brain, and
whan it states that a local Borough Couacil met
on a slushy night in a back street and rouldn’t
form a quorum, it fixes up the knowledge in an
ecudi e fashion which is calculated to make a
mlgtPy intellect wobble. The Ontenary Herald
was, if anything, more solemn than the average,
and many a six-foot policeman went in to strugg’e
v.ith it and was lose. Yet, for the sake ot a little
political support, Parkes and Co have ordered
that thii publication should be pounded into the
infant intellect all over New South Wales, and
sorrowful small boys with inky collars and little
girls with pinnies are now tearfully wrestling
with such items as these
Officers and teachers in the Department of Public Instruc
tion who are not subject to the regulative and disciplinary’
provisions of the Act are subject to the provisions for super-
annuation and kindred purpose According to these, offi-
cers of 60 years of age and upwards, of right, and under that
age on proof of mental or bodily infirmity, can claim a retir-
ing allowance; but where they retire on account of in-
firmity, if restored to health they may be called upon to re-
sume their duties The scale begins at 15 years service,
when one quarter of the annual salary is allowed, and one-
sixtieth of the annual salary for every additional year of
service The allowance must not, however, exceed two-
thirds of the annual salary. The salary is computed on the
average of the pavment for the three years preceding retire-
ment, exclusive of forage and travelling allowances. In case
of compel <ory retirement, where an officer is not entitled to
a superannuation allowance, a gratuity cf one month s pay
for each year ot service may be'granted. Where an officer is
incapacitated by bodily injury suffered in the discharge of
his duty, a gratuity of two months’ pay for each year of ser-
vice may he granted, and in case of death, under the same
circumstances, a grant of a like sum may be made to the
widow, children, or mother of the deceased. If an officer
die leaving a widow or children under the age of 16 in neces-
sitous circumstances, a gratuity not exceeding six months’
pay may be granted.
There are 36 columns of this kind of stuff, and the
infants are to plod through it all. Any poor,
miserable little wretch who can commit to memory
toe whole tremendous lot will deserve to prosper
in after life if he doesn’t burst with the pressure
of his own knowledge. The Herald’s notion of
history includes pretty nearly everything that is
dry, pompous, and dismal, from the year One
right down to the by-laws which govern the
driving of a dust-cart through the streets, and
the rules for the admission of a patient with a
broken leg to Sydney Hospital; it also covers the
number of tramcars run in Adelaide and the
mean shade temperature of Northern Queensland
worked out in decimals, and these joyous facts
are illustrated by copies of the maps which were
in use in the New South Wales schools a dozen
yea's ago. The publicity given to this b irge-load of
literary debris may possibly be gra’ifyirg to the
Herald, but it is a ghastly infliction on the rising
generation, and calculated to undermine the
morals and constitutions of the coming race of
Austra’ians. And, bad as the look out is
for the scholars, it is almost worse for
their instructors, and many a watery-eyed pupil-
teacher will curse Parkes in his inmost soul
when he views the 36 dismal columns which
he has to ‘’impart” to a shock-headed and bewil-
dered gathering. Moreover, apart from the insult
« ffered to the human understanding, the schools
which are maintained at the expense of the nation
were never intended to serve as vehicles for the
dissemination of the gospel of the Caliao Jimmies,
and for tho spread of garbled statistics to prove
the advisability of importing foreign goods while
Australians are starving for want of work
Neither ware they ever meant to serve as a cheap
advertisement for any paper which it suits Parkks
to grovel to. Tney have already been raked over
in search of coin for the Hr- Ham’s testimonial,
and many an infant has been hour.ced out of the
penny which should have bought her lunch and
had to go hungry while Parkks graciously took
the copper. Iho hoary sham should rest satisfied
with ihese achievements, and leave the school-
children in pe ca for the future. It he must tout
for the Herald, let him preserve some outward
semblance of decency, and canvass somebody a
littlj nearer to his own s ze, and. above all, let
him do it as a private speculation. The New South
Wales Treasury has sufficient calls upon it with-
out being used to advertise the obtrusive dismal-
ness of the Foreiga-trade Press.
CORRESPONDENCE
Co operative (Melbourne): The whole thing is
simple enough. You say that some of those who propose co-
operating in the establishment of a printing business have
plant and some m ,ney. Very well; first pay every
man, according to his srrvioes, on a scale you may yourselves
agree upon if you are dissatisfied with the rates that rule
the labour market. Then, out of the surplus, pay for the
plant, treating its owner as an altogether outside party. Get
comp tect valuators to assess its value, if you like, and then
buy it on the time-payment principle—s ) much a week with
a fair inte-eat on deferred payments. Now for the capital-
owning members of the co-operation. Treat them also as
outside parties. Re-pay their money in instalments, with a
moderate interest added. At the end of the year you may
have profits to divide. If you run the thing properly you
certainly ought to have. You have in the graduated scale of
wages already recognised the difference in the respective
values of the co-operators' labour, and the prefit is the result
of your united labour, of the least with the best-rndowed
working in harmony. Divide, therefore, equally, giving to
each a correlative fractional amount, for profit accrues from
the diligence and zaal of the whole C J.K.: Only of local
interest....A Coon: Thanks. Please send name and ad-
dress.,.. Walter Carson (Panbula): A better idea would be
for the heads of the Orange or New’ Holland party in N.S.W
to add “ Van” to their names in deference to the memory
of the pious and immortal Dutch potentate by whom they
are ruled. Van Jessup, Van Abigail, Van Henson, would,
in the memorable words of Mr. Alfred Bennett, “ take well
and give pleasure to all.” An Englishman: The mistake
is an obvious one. We know just as well as you do, and
h ave known it for many years, that the Duke of Cambridge
is Queen Victoria’s cousin, not her uncle. How men like
the H ihenzollerns must laugh at such a dumpy lump of im
becility at the head of an army! J. P. Clifford; Did you
write this ‘ love poem ’ in cold blood
Bright breaks the warrior o’er the ocean wave
Through realms that rove not, clouds that cannot save,
But cooped up here, within this awful place,
I still do see, Maria, thy dear face.
Thou lookest the same as when in Sydney I left thee
Thy absence of sense has almost bereft me.
Who broke the warrior ? Was he stone-broke, and why did
ho break over the ocean wave instead of into a jug? Also,
did you ever see realms that ‘ roved,’ and what in thunder
did you expect the clouds to save, and why do you go and
talk of Maria’s ‘ absence of sense ? ’ It is mean to
give a girl away as a prize idiot like that
Phos. (Geelong): No, it does not follow that the Crown
Prince will be Emperor of Germany. The Imperial position
of Germany is elective and not hereditary. The Empire
comp.ises four kingdoms, several grand-duchies, duchies,
principalities, and electorates, and the Emperor of Germany
is chosen by the rulers of these various States. The King of
Prussia managed to obtain his election to the post of Im
perial master of Teutondom as much by diplomacy as by
force. Prussia was in a position to enforce her claims, but
she may not be in a similar position in respect to the elective
Diet the.next time an Emperor has to be elected. The Ger
man Imperial crown was for many generations monopolised
by the Hapsburgs, the hereditary rulers of Austria. Austria
is now more a Magyar than a German State, and the Im-
perial rule of Germany seems to have taken up its abode
with the Hohenzollerns, the erstwhile electors of Branden-
burg and Kings of Prussia... .Darlinghurst: We ask

The Federal show at Sydney Academy
has revived a lot this week, but the
members of the company don’t pub on any
extra style in private life on account of this,
and still c? rry their clothes wrapped up in a news-
paper as belore The great feature of the pro-
gramme Is the glove contest between Koley
(Keenan) and Murke (Moynham), who let
their angry passions loose in eight rounds
till the ferocious exhibition ends in a blood-
thirsty draw. Both of them get severely injured
in the course cf the contest through falling down
heavily whenever they come within four yards of
each other, and not getting up again for some
considerable time, and at times they are with
difficulty restrained from getting out of the ring
and hitt'ng the spectators., The desperate en-
counter is carried out with Iolb. gloves, and, on
Saturday night, we observed wi*h alarm that the
combatants more than once came near whacking
each other on the head Exhibitions of this kind,
we consider, should not be allowed unless both
parties are under the influence of chloroform. The
rest of the programme is too numerous to mention
in detail. Faust, the white eyed Kaffir, proves,
on inspection, to be merely a thin nigger with
whitewash on his head, but he discourses sweet
music, and gets two on'■ores. Horace Bent and
Beaumont Read have compounded a sketch and
an extravaganza, both of wh'ch are wildly ex-
travagant, and the show, generally, is above par.
We bestow upon it our blessing.

“ Faust ” has got a firm hold at Sydney
Gaiety, and keeps on improving every night. Mr.
Dam pit r's Mephistopheles has taken possession of
the mul itude, and they roll up regularly to see
where they are all going to, and what sort of a
devil they will meet when they get there. For
our own part. Mr. Dampier is just the sort of
demon that we would be glad to go to if we had
to go and couldn’t help ourselves. He is gay and
airy, filled with sardonic jests, irony, and bravado,
and even in his moments of gloom he is an agree-
able companion, eminently suited for a small
dinner party. To a man of refinement it would
be humiliating in the last degree to find his boss
iu the next world a small, washed-out Individual
with a red nose and a bruised misfib belltopper
which he had stolen from some deacon who
came down with it on—a snuffy, seedy fiend,
weeping drunk and liable to have a head on him
next morning like any common mortal, and the
presence of such an individual would be eminently
calculated to make him wish he hadn’t been
d d. Mr. Dampier’s example, however,
should make the foul fiend straighten up and
flour his nose and behave himself, and if it does
he will have the satisfaction of knowing that he
has not played “ Faust” in vain.
The “ Mikado ” keeps op its continuous
riot at Sydney Royal with financial results of a
gratifying character. Ko-Ko has tacked on a
new verse which Gilbert never dreamt of to his
“ little list,” and, strange to say, it gets more ap-
plause than all the rest of the song. Perhaps the
public fancy' he wrote it himself, but we dis’ent,
being of opinion that he hooked it from a New
Zealand paper. The venerable grandmothers o:
the chorus are in good voice, and don’t look mor
than 17, and— well, that is about all this week
At Sydney Criterion the flow of oily Arabia
g»mmon will continue uninterruptedly till Satur
day, when a new comic opera will be produced
It is named “ Dick,' 1 and the responsibility of i
rests on Edward Jaoobowski. The “ Fort
Thieves ” have had rather a hypochondriac re
caption from the public, and Providence hasn’
tempered the witd to the shorn .Arab; conse
quently the ancient ghouls of Bagdad have re
solved to shift their tent. George Rignold
at Her Majesty's, runs “In the Ranks ” a
he did in the blessed days of yore, and to
all appearance he means to run it till Death shie
its flat-iron at mortality, and his audience go
be stirred up with a long pole in the region where
things never come to an end. Sydney has now
had about two months of “In the Ranks,” and
seems to be standing It pretty well, all things
considered. The Alhambra has some more new
programme, and Is so full that a dramatic critic
can’t get into it without being squeezed flat
People who have escaped from it alive, however
report favourably on the performance.

Oat at the little village of Coogee, where
the sad sea waves sing their washy song to the
crab, the winkle, and the great sea-serpent, the
Aquarium has lately been going in for unwonted
revelry. Mr. A. T. Smith, described in the bills
as the “ renowned characteristic burleeque and
scientific skatorial artist,” backs himself for £5OO
to lick anything mortal on two legs which cares
to skate against him, and, meanwhile he exhibits
his skill in marvellous slippery evolutions for the
gratification of the public. It is rumoured that
Parke? intends to take up the challenge and
deposit his bill at three months without endorse-
ment in the hands of the management, but this
report at present lacks confirmation.

The fascinating St. Maur is making things
vastly pleasant at Melbourne Alexandra, where
“ The Arabian Nights” acquires more giddy polish
as time goes on. There is so much human nature
about this accomplished actor —especially when ha
takes the ladies on his knee and practices a Grseco-
Roman hug—ttat it has infected his company to
some small extent, and made them less like an
arid desert surrounding a green oasis of St Maur.
But, considering that the Alexandra stage is a few
s'z’S too large for light comely, it is a pity this
amusing show couldn’t be set up at the Opera
House, in place of Mesmeriter Kennedy. That
canny magician continues to find employment for
a faithful band of “subjects,” who go through
the sane old unhealthy tommy-nonsense with an
ardour worthy of a nobler cause. A private per-
formance for the especial benefit of the medical
profession and the Press was arranged last week.
Kennedy threw his three staunchest adherents
into a condition which was cataleptic or acrobatic,
and proceeded to “test ’ them on a system of bia
own. These tests so far sa isfled tbe medicine-
men that they went away wagging their heads ; but
as the Press never got a look In anyho v, they
departed with a sneaking suspicion that they had
been “ had.”

his seventh month at Garner’s Theatre, and,

to go on till the day the trumpets are to sound,

An Australian Oroesus,
Writes a Melbourne correspondent
There were two incidents marking Tues-
day, Feb. 7, as an eventful day. At 5 a.m. the
richest of Australians left his golden hoards to
mount the golden stairs and at II a m. tne wires
brought the news that put the Mount Morgan
jumpers out of their misery.

The worshippers o! the Golden Oalf have
lost their idol. The death of Henry Miller will
dissipate his many millions, and one man can be
no longer looked on as beia-ij, in his own pe son.
fifty times as wealthy as any other man. Tnere
may have been a doubt as to whether this distinc-
tion cjuld rot be also claim* d by James Tyson, or
whether ths honour—if it is an honour—should
not bo divided between hem But Miller was
known as “Mmey Miller” even at a time
when Tyson was picking wool ciT the bushes and
fences, as boys pick up cigar-ends from the gutter.
The American phrase of “ a remarkable
man’' applied well to tVs dsad Ciceros. He
never took a holiday, and was careful that his
sons should imitate him In that way. To stick to
the offloe-scool for 55 years was h‘s recipe for
getting rich, as It was Sir Joseph Porter's for
getting the management of the “ Queen's Navee.”
He early learnt thai “money breeds money.”
While the squatters thrive by the breeding of
cattle and sheep, Money Miller did similarly by
adding pound to pound, hundred to hundred,
thousand to thousand, and million to million.
The progeny of the pounds appeared in the shape
of interest which could be similarly set to breed-
ing as soon as born, and became as prolific as its
parents.

The Melbourne papers were singularly
skimpy in information as to this man’s wealth
and the way of its investment. Mention was
only made of the Exchange, the Wes'ern market,
and a block of tbrse houses in Collins street,
which were bub “ a circumstance,” a mere patch
on the clothing of wealth that covered Miller.
Scarcely a street in Melbourne or any of its
suburbs but held property of his —acquired either
as buyer or mortgagee. Large estates lay outside
of Melbourne, and large squatting stations farther
afield. Young Morrison, who canoed down the
Murray, tells of his taking two days to pats the
boundaries of one of Miller’s stations.
* * *
Then he had horses and cattle, owned half
a bank and half of an Insurance Company, had
shares in the beat paying mines and investments.
GafFnsy’s Creek No. 1 mine fell into his hands,
or nearly all of it did, as mortgagee, and brought
in something heavy every month. He found
money for all large contractors, and was their
guarantor—drawing the government moneys
coming to them. He was surety for all large in-
testate estates. He was the great mortgagee of
his colony to whom all who waute i money went
for loans. They paid him commission as well as
interest—for such were his terms. His rent-roll
was the largest in Australia. His revenue from
mortgages larger still, and yet larger his in-
come from discounts and daily dealings with
money which came into his hands but never went
through them—most of it sticking to bis fingers.
* - *
It was curious to notice how different ths
fate of the two hro hers Henry and Mars. The
latter, a worthy man enough, seemed never able
to keep any money—it fled from him as water
from a duck's back, while ail money seemed to
flow to his financial brother and to stagnate with
him. He had, this Money Miller, an abnormally
developed financial ability—a gift of nature
against which he could not struggle. He cams
into the world to amass money as a bull dog does
to fight. He never paid for an offlca or kept a
clerk. No one, consequently, knew his business
or his intentions or “little games.” He pat up
daily in the hoard-room of the Insurance Com-
pany of which he was chairman and kept his
memorandum-book in his pocket and his accounts
in his head. He did that without labour which
those not so naturally endowed would have failed
to do with ail assistance. He was called a mil-
lionaire in 1853, and is believed to have doubled
his wealth every five years from that time. What
he died worth will likely never be known, as the
estates he possessed were easily transferable and
most probably re, in the main, disposed of
otherwise than by will.
* * *
He had one fancy, apart from the main
one of money-making which absorbed his life.
This was for Scott’s novels, which he is believed
to have read through once a year, and that for a
score of years in succession. And now this Vic-
torian Rothschild and Melbourne Vanderbilt has
gone under —quite in the way that a poor man
would. He will draw no more cheques in which
halfpence figured with all exscneas. His moun-
tain of money will be distributed, and there will
be none to really mourn for Money Miller the
Millionaire.
* * *
His influence was quits catching—it per-
meated through a foot-thick wall to where sat
John Linay, a clerk in the insurance cfiice, wh »
died some five years back, leaving £lO,OOO to
Melbourne ohai’i ies. Nothing but beicg daily so
near to such a money-maker as Miller enabled
Linay to do this wonder of saving out of his
weekly salary He, tco, learnt the way of setting
money a breeding and of nursing the progeny.
The saving father—the wealthy miser, has often,
too often, spendthrift sons, but such is not be-
lieved to be the case with the family of this de-
ceased Croesus. Whether there is a younger
Vanderbilt among the five sons has yet to be seen,
but if so, then the name of Miller may keep alive
the money-meaning which for 10 years has at-
tached to it in Victoria.
Another Melbourne correspondent writes
“ Money” Miller, a man whose rare genius for
getting rich was never prostituted, has quietly de-
parted this life and been duly buried. The dally
Press, usually so ready to heap grovel upon the
grave of an “old identity,” and to sing the
praises of real and personal estate, has done less
than justice to the memory of this richest of Vic-
torian pioneers. In his various public capacities
Henry Miller had made no attempts to catch the
vulgar eye and pose as a representative colonist,
yet the while he was doing more useful work than
any sixC.M.Gs. The present generation didn't
know (until it was grudgingly mentioned in
obituary notices) that the unpopular old financier
drafted the Constitution for Victoria, brought
forward the first Public Education Bill, and was
one of the promoters of the ballot in Parlia-
mentary elections. Melbourne Mint owes its
existence to Henry Miller ; the Bank of Victoria
has had no other Chairman as yet; he was tha
originator of insurance-companies and building
societies in the colony. If “ Money ” Miller
earned his sobriquet by the success of these en-
terprises, let it also be remembered that he
brought grist to other mills, and without making
any living soul a penny the poorer. Before the
days of newspaper celebrity and banquet fame—
when there was no bit ding for knighthood with
ostentatious charity, and no particular sasnety
which required to be wined, dined, and danced
Henry Miller was better known and better spoken
of. For the last 20 years he has gradually piled
up a colossal repu ation lor meanness among
people who knew very little about him, without
losing the esteem of an employe or the love of hia
family. There are those who can testify that the
shrewd old gentleman never refused to assist
a deserving case and never wanted his assist-
ance published to the world. When that
florid philanthropist, Mr. Francis Ormond,
offered to give £5OOO to the Melbourne Cathedra
Fund on condition that other gentlemen raised
£5OOO among them, Bishop Moorhouse had no
occasion to tout further than Mr. Miller's private
residence. He was asked for a portion, but wrote
his cheque for the whole £5OOO. A mere baga-
telle to a man of his wealth, but more than Her
Gracious ever subscribed towards a national
work. For the rest, “Money” Miller was a
liberal purchaser of pictures and books, who
always dropped his note in the plate, but saw no
sin in supporting a stud of thoroughbreds for the
amusement of his sons. He was too well-bred a
man to care for entertaining a sassiety that drops
its h’s about, or for toadying to the Governor and
titled globe-trotters. And no millionaire was
ever more sincerely mourned by his heirs and
assignees.

George Leitch, of theatrical celebrity, tells
a melancholy story of how he met with an ancient
relic an Levuka (F ji), and how tha relic took him
in. He was negotiating for the loan of a horse,
and the courteous innkeeper produced a ram-
shackle an imal which had strayed by accident in-
to the wide realm of zoology, and informed him
that he would find the beast friendly and reliable.
So he did. Ic tacked first for the sea and then
made for a ditch and it had convulsions every few
yards, and every now and then it fell into a con-
templative mood oat of which it scrambled with
considerable difficulty. It didn't give the eminent
actor the slightest show to view ihe scenery, and
a'ter it had fallen into a river and baea too much
astonished to get out without assistance, George
dragged it bade to its owner who inquired if he
hadn’t enjoyed himself. He had quite for-
gotten, ho added cheerfully, to mention that
the horse was quite blind of both eyes, but he
would probably find the moke perform better
in a buggy. George said he would try him in
tho buggy and so an aged vehicle was hauled out
—a rust-coloured trap with faded blue cushions
from which the ito fling pi ejected, and with rat-
holes at every corner and a general appearance of
having been welted with clubs by the infuriated
populace, and Leicoh and his host set out on a
breathless tear ro md the coast. “’Tain’t every
gentleman can beast of having a ride in this

The vacant Hew South Wales judgeship
has been filled, and Water Jug Foster has risen to
the dignity of tha Bench. Some twelve months
ago Mr. Foster resigned tha Attorney-Generalship
on the ground that he had been cozened out of
this same elevated billet, and that he could no
longer have confidence in Parkes; and Parkes re-
plied that he had also lost confidence in Foster,
and each pretty well raid he didn’t want to know
the other much any more. Bat scon another vacant
judgeship began to loom on the horizon,
and then Foster’s confidence in Parkes —
which, as defined in his memorable letter,
seems to have meant his confidence that Parkes
would give him a permanent job—began to revive,
and Parkes’a confidence in Foster—which, to
judge from his actions, meant his confldanca that
he could bounce Foster out of the job if it suited
him —also underwent a recovery. Foster, in
former days, lent to the Government that element
of godliness with which Parkes always finds it ex-
pedient to be associated, and now Sir Henry has
squared up the account for this borrowed piety,
and his old supporter has his reward. There is
no reason to believe that the appointment will,
from a public standpoint, be a success N.S, W.
has reason to be satisfied with such big-
brained men as Barley and Owen, but the
narrow-minded Foster is not of them. He is
a dull mediocrity, after the fashion of Innes and
Windeyer—- a pair who would shed far more lustre
on the billet of clerk of petty sessions or deputy-
sheriff than they are ever likely to do on their
present high offices. Mr, Foster has no right to
sit on the Supreme Court Bench under any cir-
cumstances whatsoever; his appointment only
serves to complete a trinity of pettifoggers. Hia
rise is a purely political job, though Parkes haa
lopg boasted that he never appointed a Supreme
Court judge from political motives. When
Foster was disappointed on a previous occa-
sion, he raised a dust which seriously
damaged the Ministry, and a second disappoint-
ment would almost to a certainty have driven him
into active hostility. The result of the election
which must ensue at Newtown, will show whether
this sacrifice of the dignity of tha Bench will servo
any good purpose for Parkes or not. At present
the chances are that a Protectionist will be re-
turned, and, if so, it would have bean better for
Henry of Brummagem if ho had again trusted to
the long-suffering nature of the follower who was
“ slipped up " and who might, by ajbare possi-
bility, have endured being “ slipped up (' again.

The man who edits the overblown turnip

Yet another feather in Bega’s cap. Mr. W. R. Emley, the
cordial-manufacturer of whom we are all justly proud, re.
oelved a letter from the Premier last week asking to be
supplied by him with cordials, and stating that the ginger-
beer manufactured by him is the best he (Sir Henry Parkes)
ever tasted. It is to be regretted that Mr. Emley could not
see his way clear to comply with the request, but had to de-
cline the patronage that many would reasonably feel proud

burst because Parkes, after having raked the
world in search of good ginger-beer, ordered two
dozen from this ornament of the district and

minates over the fact that the gentleman who
gives slops to the local public “couldn’t eee bis

apex of its ferocity is reached when It realises
that Parkes mnst continue to parch. Why Parkes

adequately explained—probably the order was re-

something. Times are so bad now in N.S.W. that
it is difficult to imagine any cause, short of re-

If it isn’t too late, wa would suggest that
an alteration should be made in the Queen’s Cen-
tennial “ shatter ” recently fixed up In King-street,
Sydney, and that the lady should he fastened on
a swivel. In her present position the Pre-em'nent
in Grief has to ke;p her eye all tha time on that
melancholy pile, the Emigration Barracks -one of
Sydney’s poor houses—whereas if she were ar-
ranged so that she could whiz round, she would
get a glimpse of Albeit the Gocd at one moment
and of the Beautiful Harbour the next, and would
be able to see what was going on ia the bar at
the Oxford Hotel and elsewhere. A Queen ia not
supposed to be tied down like a blessed vegetable,
and the statue should be fixed so that it can have
a fly-round when it wants it. Under existing
circumstances, the-e might be as many as tea
dog-fights going on behind her, and she wouldn’t
he able to get a glimpse of one of them. What a
bronze Agger mostly wants is variety—not abso-
lute excitement or riot, but a little change now
and then, and, above all, it doesn’t want to have to
gaze all the time on a miserable Emigration Bar-
rack or a Soup Kitchen or a lob of lawyers.
Such a monotonous life undermines a bronze
image faster than anything we know.

Up at Darlinghurat (Sydney) there is an
establishment! wish a big sign fixed up outside
from which tha words “ Home of Hope ” glare ob-
trusively at the parser-by, anltothls institution
the Prison gats Brigade brings its captives to be
rubbed down and fed, and started in the road
they ought to go. As we drifted by this institu-
tion the other morning, we observed a aeedy-look-
ing stranger, evidently a released prisoner, calmly
shoring his back against the doorpost and picking
his teeth in a meditative fashion. Kvidently he
was a rescued sinner, and, having been taken in
and supplied with breakfast, he had been fixed up
outside with a toothpick as a visible sign that
there were victuals within. The idea is not a bad
one, and yet, to speak seriously, it might be as
well if the s ! gnbo»rd atthe “ Home of Hope” were
not quite so obtrusive. It gives away the inmates
too much, and it would be better if it were fixed
in some other part of the city, so that the released
pickpocket might see It and learn the address of
the establishment, and then go there without
drawing public attention to bis movements. A
brass plate nailed outside Parliament House
would supply all the information needed and
at the same time would offend nobody's sensi-
bilities. There is no one inside the House who
was ever in gaol or who is ever likely to go there
or who deserves to go there, so the members could
afford to have a signboard attached to their pre-
mises which would seem like a studied insult
if it were affixed to the Yourg Men’s Christian
Association or even to the Law Courts. We com-
mend this idea to the chie's of the Halleluj ah band
without preiudica or malice aforethought, and
trust they will accept it in the spirit of holy calm
with which it is offered. If they will come
around we will give then a small monetary sub-
scription to serd the work along, ard meanwhile
we pray that the shadow of the Gospel Army may

One of the things calculated to strike a stranger

punishment tasks in the garish light of day and
beneath the commenting gaze of their fellow-
townsmen. At Port LyttVoa we saw the chain-
gang going to their worn u the morning. There
were two detachments, dressed in somewhat dif-
ferent uniforms These were the long and the
short-sentenced prisoners At the head of one
group tramped abroad-sho u dered, stril ing looking
man, withayellowbearda .da scar over his eye We
should know that man again amongst a thousand.
He is photographed in our mind, branded as a
felon. What chance is there for re'ormation ?
What opportunity henceforth for honestly earn-
ing even daily bread ? 1 hat man may be punished
innocently and may perhaps be proved to bo inno-
cent ; but what would that avail him with those
who have seen him marching thus to work pub-
licly branded as a felon, to those who may never
hoar of his innocence, but to whom one day he
may present himself in some character of business
or trust ? All punishments for a term of years—
either short or long—arc based upon the principle
of reclamation. They are not supposed to make
the culprit worse, but better than before ti'eir
Infliction, otherwise it would bo cruel to society
to turn gaol-manufactured criminals loose upon
it. Yet here we have the illogical instance of a
punishment intended to reclaim which in its
working precludes tte pos-ibility of reclamation.
There are so no functions which society, like the
individual, should perform in retirement.
“ How is history written ?” is often asked. It is
written in a diversity of ways. This was how
Kinglakb’s celebrated “ History of the Crimea,”
now only just completed, and of which reviews
have just appeared in the Australian da lies, was
written. In the forties, when Louis Napoleon
was a mysterious and impecunious exile in Lon-
don, he and Kinglake belonged to the same
London club. It happened that Kinglake was
spending some of the profits of his last literary
venture on the maintenance, in St, Johns Wood
(where, unlike Cologne, the tombs of the Thousand
Virgins have not yet become an attraction), of a
fair, but frail one, to whom he was apparently rather
attached. Her fairness might have been doubted,
but certainly not her frailty, when she presently
transferred her affections and herself to the
romantic future Emperor. Kinglake swore
vengeance, and a chance gave him the op-
portunity of venting it. Bis adventurous
spirit carried hi n out to the Crimea, in a literary
capacity, and there the fact of Lord Baglan s
great admiration of his first well-known work,
“Eothen,” procured him tbe Commander-m-
Chief s personal acquaintance, and, indeed, friend-
ship. When Kinglake returned home, and de-
liberately set himself to write his “ History of the
Crimea,” he prefacsd it with that bitter expose of
Louis Napoleon and Ms associates of the bloody
coup d etat of 1852 which was so wholly out of
place, however brilliant or however true, that the
cause of it utterly mystified the public then and
has since. The inevitable query of the Turkish
Emir, however, whose comment in every trouble
or disturbance was, “Where is the woman?’
would have laid bare this mystery also, and
shown us one of the ways in which history is
written.
One day last month a man, who was formerly an
adherent of Pabkes in the Assembly, and who
was some time ago elevated by Pabkes to a high
position in the New South Wales Civil Service,
was charged at a Sydney Police Court with an
act of disgraceful larribinism in a public-house.
He did not appear, however, and his case was
carefully suppressed by all the Sydney dailies,
excepting only the saintly and unctuous Herald,
and that journal saved his reputation by tolling
the worst of all lies—that which is half the truth
—and dropping one of the initials attached to his
exceedingly common name, so that the identity of
this uproarious lout remained unsuspected. When
one of Parkes’ supporters is concerned the Sydney
Freetrade Press is always dumb, though when
one of his opponents gets into trouble (as on a
recent occasion) the affair appears at length with
six head lines and an intimation that the country
is going to the dogs and the swine. Even the
Herald, whose reputation for accuracy used to
be its one redeeming feature, would now seem to
garble its reports to hide the disgrace of one of
Sir Henrv's proteges, and if the great Hi-Ham
himself appeared—which, thank Heaven, is an
impo siblo supposition- among the drunks in the
Police Court dock, it would simply state that
“John Barkks was fined ss. and costs." Long
years spent in compounding Ijiog Freetrade
statistic! have undermined the character of the
Sydney Press, and even the Police Court drudge
has to follow in the well-worn brack of A nanias
when the interests of the Foreign-trade-protoction
party aro mperilled.
The King of the Shearers has left this stage.
No more will he shear sheep ;
He laid him down on the narrow gauge
And closed his eyes in sleep ;
An engine came with a puff and a roar
(Swift as the wind it sped);
And the King of the Shearers was “ gone before,”
For it cut off his blooming head.
The King of the Shearers he dwells above
(Above means Heaven, you see).
There’s many a job’in the Land of Live
For boys as smart as he.
And though he's left this vale of tears
Never a friend need weep,
For merry’s the click of the Shearer's shears
As he tackles the angel sheep.
The King of the Shearers, we now repeat,
Is working ia the fold;
And he hears the dear familiar bleat
Within those Gates of Gold ;
The fleece of the sheep is fine and long
And cleansed with Jordan Dip—
But the poor goats’ beards, so matted and strong,
The D 1, no doubt, will clip,

Even as the grass, on tha morrow like grass we

Not so can I, for the world is a shamble of slaying ;
Round me they fall, as tha grass that is mown

Not as the grass that doth fade, to the utmost
empowered
All the advantage of living to own while it can,
But as the blades that are mown, or of locusts
devoured,
Such is tha ending of joy and of living to Man.
Wise he who lives ere the scythe or the swarm

Tainting nob joy with forebodings that mutter
of harm;
Yet, if he sees, ’twere both kindness and wisdom

Should he not waken the harrowing cry of
alarm.
What is the need of this ruthless, this pitiless
reaping?
Why should we idly laugh, letting the locusts
abound ?
Joys should be ours in the days Nature meant for
our keeping—
Why should we suffer them shorn, as the grass
on the ground ?
Wherefore the bard cries : Leave the weak present

Labour and conquer the ills, that they come not

Then shall our longer days bring happier treasures
Freely to all men, as life that is brought to the

sped,
And the painted monarch of the soil cowered with
a new-bcm dread,
As like a star he saw the vessel rise from out the
sea,
An avcvnt courier to tell a change of monarchy;
To all the world a change for weal, to him a
change for woe,
Yet they knew not what the future veiled a hun-
dred years ago.
But what see we who stand upon the summit of
those years?
A prospect bright, though tie rearward look is
not undlmmed by tears:
Strong Yeung Australia stands to day with a
gleaming in her eye
That tells to those of power to see she was nob
barn to die,
Although upon her virgin skirts the blood of con-
victs hung,
And (baser shame) grim convict laws her heaving
bosom wrung.
Aye I though she yet with heavy heart may lend
a fettered hand
To gild decaying forms of wrong, wrought in her
mother land,
Forewarned by all the old-world ills with clearer
ej e to see
Wfcat brotherhood and justice mean, and love and
purity,
The noblest of the youngest, and the fairest of the
fair,
In her panoply of righteousness, one day she ll do
and dare
More than the hoary nations did, for lack of heart
or will,
Whose wealth had silenced poverty with the man-
date, “ Peace, be si ill!”
If, crowning all her mightiness which surely is
to be,
She’ll ever wear the diadem of truth and liberty.
Say ye, her loyal sons who love to call her land
your home,
How great Australia yet shall be a hundred years
to come.

Editor Haddon, of Melbourne Argus,
celebrated his forty-ninth b’rthday last week.
Arthur Garner, of the Triumvirate, had a festivity
over his thirty-seventh anniversary, the same
day. On Now Year’s Day the portly editor cele-
brated the majority of hia editorship of the Vic-
torian Freetrader.
Supreme Court Judge Owen, of Sydney,
has a German tipstaff who is quite in love with
his master. “Do you know,” he delightfully said
to a lawyer, one day, “ vhy Judge Owen is de best
man in de whole vorld to vork for ? I vill tell you.
It vos zhouat because Judge Owen he la von per-
fect Irish shentleman.”
When the present Pope was nuncio at
Brussels he attended a dinner-party where a
nobleman asked him to admire a lovely Venus on
the lid of a snuff-box—expecting to amuse the
company at the expense of the nuncio. “ Charm-
ing 1 ” said Monsignor Pecci, quietly returning the
box, “ is it a portrait of madame la marquise ? ”
A dead-beat waited upon Bishop Byrne
(R.C.) at Bathurst, recently, and, with sighs and
tears, informed that potentate that he was tired
of the Protestant religion and wished to join the
Catholic Church, winding up with a request for
half a-orown to get a breakfast. The Bishop gave
him the coin, desiring him to get the needed
meal, but not to trouble about joining the Church.
The champion N.Z. strong man is an Irish
policeman, of Auckland—one Doyle, or something
—who oan raise 140 lbs. over his head with one
hand, and so on. Said a man to him the other
day ; * ‘ How easily you must be able to run In the
drunks? ” “ Yes,” replied Mr. Doyle, “It is easy
for a man like me to run in a drunk All I have
to do is to talk to him very soft and hold him very
hard."
The other day Justice Williams, of Vic-
toria, was hearing a case in which the Colonial
Bank was a party, Managpr Greenlaw was put
in the box, and, as usual, didn’t improve the
bank's case. When Williams came to charge the
jury he said: —“Gentlemen, when I was at the
B',r and gob briefs for the bank, I used to shake
in my shoes when Mr. Greenlaw got into the
box !”
When J. F. Hogan, of the Melbourne
Argus, author of “ The Irish in Australia,” was
lately in Birmirgham interviewing Bishop Ulla-
thorne (halt a century ago Vicar-General of New
Holland) he had an audience of Cardinal Newman
at the Bdgbaston Oratory. Curlous’y enough,
Hogan didn't a r k John Henry to explain the last
lines of “Lead Kindly Light.” Every well-in-
formed admirer of Newman does.
Says Henry Stuart Russell in his new hook
“ The Genesis of Queensland” : -“I have paced
again that Paradise, pathless, yet around that pen
if punishment; that pens! path within which
pity is but a poor phantom of rags, and pain soon
palsies the prison pulses ” The alliteration in
that sentence is a masterpiece and makes it a
worthy rival of the famous Peter Piper, who
picked a peck cf pickled pepper.
The Melbourne Herald has been getting
at poor Mr. Nimmo about some Government
boilers, lying exposed cn the wharf at Mel-
bourne. In the first instance, Nimmo protested
that the beikra were about to be moved, thru it
was announced that a rough shelter had been
ordered for them; finally Nimmo settled the
matter by discovering that .exposure to cold and
rain is just what boilers like. There ano arguing
against a teetotal Scotchman.
The other day when an Indignant rate-
payer, writing all over six sheets of foolscap
enquired for the eleventh time of a Sydney sub-
urban council why that ancient dead dog had
not been shifted from his front door, he addressed
his Worship as “ Month Black, Esq.” The Council
Clerk remonstrated and said the chief magistrate's
name was Weeks-White. The ratepayer replied
that “ho knew it was something about time and
some darned colour or other.”
Immediately a'ter the d ;ath of a certain
N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge, David Buchanan,
Judge Docker, and a number of other members of
the “ Devil's Own," were journeying (on circuit)
THE REASON OF IT.
INQUIRING FREETRADE FRIEND (to newly-elected M.L.A. in buggy): “GLAD TO SEE YOU GOT IN! BUT,

M.L.A : “WELL, AIN’T I SUPPORTIN’ A PROTECTIONIST COUNTRY!"
between Coonamble and Coonanbarabran, when
the conversation turned on the lately-decaased
official. Said Dawvid: “He was very fond of
me. he was; he told me bo him-elf." Quoth
Judge Docker, with his usual snuffle; “That
must have been when his brain was softening 1”
The following relic of the past, written by
the explorer Cunningham, was found many years
afterwards, and shows a strong feature in the
character of Australia’s pioneer :—“ In this cave
(situated about 70 miles from Bathurst) the under-
signed poor individual retreated in order to
examine in hrrmetlcal retirement the botanical
treasures discovered by him on the 23 rd April,
1817 ; journeying to the western coast.— Allan
Cunningham, H.B M.’s Botanist, 3 o’clock p.m.

Item from recently-published autobiography
of W. P. Frith, the English artist: “ Dr. Summer,
Bishop of Winchester, seemed though nearly
eighty years old, to ba so hale and hearty, that I
was tempted to ask it he had bean specially careful
about exercise or diet, and the bishop's reply was:
‘I have eaten of whatever good things were put
before me, and I have drunk a bottle of port wine
every day since I was a boy. The only precaution
I have taken has been in the quality of the wine;
for, unless It was old and good, I would have none
of it.’ ”
N.S. Wales has had five Chief Justices,
Forbes, Dowling, Stephen, Martin, and Darley.
The third and fifth still live, while portraits of the
first four adorn the Supreme Court walls. That
of Sir James Martin is in the Banco Court;
Forbes, Dowling, and Stephen shine in oil in the
nisi prius room. A coincidence in connection
with these three is that the son of one is a
Supreme Court Judge, and the sons of the other
two occupy seats on the District Court Bench of
the colony. In fact, judgeships run in families in
N.S.W.
The clever and erudite Herbert Palmer,
of the Melbourne Herald, has a habit of taking
an interest in promising lads, and a few years
ago he picked up a youth named Maguire (a
junior on the Herald; who possessed the poetic
faculty, and trotted him out a 3 aa iafant pheno-
menon in the pages of his Imperial Review.
Palmer thought Maguire was going to be another
Kendall or Gordon, but the other day the miser-
able youngster joined “the foorce” and is now
engaged in the literary work of making out
charge-sheets and compiling inventories under
distress-warrants.
One of the earliest advocates of the policy
of Protection in Victoria wai the late Ambrose
Kyte, M.L.A. for Mast Melbourne. Ambrose
boasted on the hus ings that he commenced life
as a barraw-mau, at which he earned about Bs. a
week and his “tucker,” bub he always managed
to put by 4s. a week for a rainy day. He died
wealthy. He was the originator of the expedi-
tion, commanded by Burke and Wills, wh'ch
crossed Australia in ’6l, having anonymously
given £lOOO to start the fuid. He it was who
took Barry Sullivan by the hand, and helped to
make his Australian career a success.
Morel M‘Kenzie, the London throat-
speclalisb who has teen in attendance on the Ger-
man,Crown Prince, is one of the boat-hated doc-
tors in the profession. He is not on speaking
terms with the set comprising Sir Andrew Clarke,
Sir William Gall, and Spencer Wells, of whom
he has often spoken with undisguised contempt.
He is a tall, lean, vigorous, mutton-chop-whiskered
Scotchman with the most decided manners. As
an operator he Is said to be unequalled, and his is
the only British name that is recognised by the
throat-specialists of Paris, Berlin, and, above all,
of Vienna, the first school in the world for this
branch. He charges three guineas for the first,
and a guinea for every subsequent visit, and from
60 to 80 people gather in his consulting rooms each
morning and wait for hours with exemplary
patience.
Mr James Payn, the novelist (who writes
London gossip for the Melbourne Argus) is the
edit o' of the Corniiill Magazine, and adjoining
his sanctum in Waterloo Place is the office of a
medical and surgical journal One day his door
was cautiously opened by a pale faced and long-
haired person, who, in answer to his interrogative
glanca, said slowly and dubiously: “I have
brought you a little thing about Sarcoma and
Carcinoma.” “lam sorry to say, sir,” replied
Mr. Pajn, blandly, “that we have all the poetry
on hand that we can use at present." The visitor
did not withdraw, however. “Poetry!” he ex-
claimed—“this is not poetry! It is an essay for
the medical journal on two tumors—Sarcoma and
Carcinoma” “I beg your pardor," the editor
said, unruffled by his mistake—“l thought they
were Italian lovers." The long-haired gentleman
was a medical professor, who had blundered Into
the wrong office.
The death of A. G. Jone'», formerly
M.L.A. for the Murrumbidgee, and atone time
proprietor of the Wagga Wagga Advertiser,
was lately recorded Mr, Jones was an ordained
clergyman of the Anglican Church, and a most
eccentric individual. He gave up the Church to
engage in squatting pursuits, and was formerly
the owner of considerable station property. He
was an excellent judge of sheep, and a keen hand
at a bargain. At certain times he was considered
fair game for plucking by gome of the “smart”
station-agents, bat could generally manage to
hold his own in any company. A couple of in-
stances will suffice. Strolling down Collins-street,
Melbourne, one day, after having bad an exceed-
ingly festive time, he was espied by an agent who
had a fine let of sheep to sell, suoh as Mr. Jones
had never had t hrough hii hands before, &c , &c.
An adjournment was made to the office, the
matter talked over, and half-an-hour given A. G.
for consideration. The number of sheep was
20,000, and the price 93. In half-an-hour A. G. J.
returned, closed the bargain, ani desired the
agent to hand over the sheep to Mr. So-and-so, as
he had meanwhile sold them at an advance
of elghteenpenoe a head. On another occasion he
purchased at auction, in Melbourne, station
property to the value of £50,000, and tendered his
cheque on the A, J.S. Bank for the amount to the
somewhat astounded auctioneer, who did not
happen to know his customer. On wiring to the
Joint Stock Bank to know if Jones’ cheque for
fifty thou, was good, the answer flashed back,
“Yes; quite good.” And now he has passed
away, and few so poor as do him reverence.
POLITICAL
POINTS
Abigail’s reputation has declined shixty
per ehent.
GL H Reid will be the N.S.W. Freetrade
leader, after Parkes.
Both the Evening News and the Daily
Telegraph (Sydney) ate getting ready to “rat”
to Protection.
Water-Jag Foster contributes £25 towards
the Parkes Fund. This ia returning good for evil
with a vengeance.
The codlin moth has commenced its
ravages at Bathurst, N.B.W. A iust judgment
for codlin Cords, M.P.
Three-ball Abigail styles Treasurer Burns
“his respected colleague.” We wonder if pretty
Cooky returns the compliment.
Parkes’ Breadless Home Fuad amounts to
less than £9OOO, which sum could easily have
been raised in the time for a dog-fight.
Ex-Premier Service, of Victoria, says that
“pride is not in his nature.” That's why ho
didn’t mind holding office at £2OOO a year with
Graham Berry.
The Sydney E. News says, “ The present
N.S.W. Government has lost a great portion of
the popularity it enjoyed when it came into
power, and is losing ground with the public every
day.”
There are now two Allens and two Abbotts
in the N.S.W. Assembly—one Abbott and one
A linn on either side. This being so, it would bo
well to dispense with one Abbott and one Allen,
and save a lot of jaw.
The Molong Express editor says, in re
the N.S.W. Centennial rejoicings “It would
have been more righteous had the effigies of the
official pioneers been burnt and their ashes cursed
for ever as an enduring condemnation of merci-
less, godless, and brutal tyranny."
Sydney people had to go to a Melbourne
daily to get the truth about the unveiling of the
Queen’s statue. The fact was that not a solitary
cheer went up when Lady Caring ton undressed
the muscular representation of her fat Gracious.
Tens of thousands of witnesses can testify to this.
Sir Thomas M‘llwraith, in a letter to the
Brisbane Courier, shows how the H. E. Telegraph
Co. could profitably send cablegrams for half-a-
crown a word instead of 4s. fid. He directly
charges the company with watering their stoak
and returning their gains at 6 instead of 18 or 20
per cent.
The Adelaide Seamen’s Union is both
better organised and better led than any other in
Australia. The men are thorough, and not half-
hearted tinkerers at the social problem, contami-
nated by the old, played-out, selfish, English
“ Trades'Union” spiri* l . This is the only good
thing, we reckon, that ever came out of holy
Adelaide.
Thus the “Vagabond” in re the late
demonstration of Labour in Sydney :—“ Perhaps
not even in Victoria has labour ever achieved
such a triumph over officialism. Strange to say, I
find a strong republican feeling amongst the
masses in Sydney, a feeling perhaps of re-action
against the Crown oligarchy which so long ruled
this colony."
A Protectionist Ministry has been formed
in Sweden. A few months ago Attorney-General
Wise, of N.S.W., in a Freetrade speech, which
lasted until his wind gave out, stated that Sweden
was one of the few enlightened countries which
were going in for Freetrade, and now the Scandi-
navians, with malice aforethought and sheer dog
meanness, have gone back on him.
Newspaper men in Germany have to be
very careful about punctuation. The Hofer
Tageblatt, a short time ago, said a decoration
had been conferred upon Count von Holstein. By
an oversight, an exclamation-point, instead of a
period, appeared at the end of the sentence, and
for this the authorities seized the whole issue and
instituted a suit against the editor for atrocious
libel.
Henry Harrie Cooke, by the grace of the
Orange Lodge member of Parliament for Forbes
(N.S.W ), stated in his place in the ’Ouse that the
State should part with no land, “ but the time
had not yet come for that policy !” Of course not.
Henry Harrie will sit idly at the back of Premier
Parkes and vote like the other dumb-driven cattle
until the land is all gone ; then he’ll wake up to
the stern reality and in all probability find his
occupation gone and his seat, too.
Eggs is riz. Melbourne Age perorates
thus :
There is a Socialism in the air which ia formless, for it has
not yet determined for itself exactly what its needs are. but
which animates millions of men as a conviction or wish, a
vague feeling that extremes of poverty can be prevented,
that labour can be assured of constant employment, and
that many advantages which rich men monopolise-—the com-
mand of bisuro, the opportunity of study, and the enjoy-
ment of art—may be communicated without stint to the
poor.
P.S.—Mr. Joseph Syme is still absent on his
honeymoon trip, which, by the way, is to extend
over two solid years. Yum Yum I
Sir Robert Wisdom has half-paralysed
theN.S.W. Freetraders by announcing his eon >
version to Protection, and this after living a year
or two In England! The Protectionists can do
without Wise so long as they have Wisdom. It
was announced the other day with a flourish of
trumpets by the N.S.W. Freetrade Press that
Wisdom was going to succeed Wise as Attorney-
General in the Parkes Ministry. The offer was
made. The result is the above announcement,
John Bright said In a speech at Dublin
October 30, 1886, that —
When the ancient Hebrew prophet prayed in his captivity
he prayed with his window opened towards Jerusalem. You
know that the follow ra of Mahoiqmed when they pray turn
their faces towards Mecca. When the Irish peasant asks for
food, and freedom, and blessing, his eye follows the setting
sun : the aspirations of his heart reach beyond the wide
Atlantic, and in spirit he grasps hands with the great Re-
public of the West.
And now- when that same Irish peasant asks for
food, freedom, and common justice, that same
John Bright calls him a rebel, an associate of
American dynamiters, and a murderer.

It is stated that a certain Australian
Governor ha’, of late, b:en very successful in
mining speculations into which he has been put
by hibitues of Government House. As His Ex-
cellency may not yet have had time to read up
early colonial history we do ourselves the pleasure
of stating, for his information, that the first Aus-
tralian mining boom was fixed up in the year 1788
by a gentleman named Dailey, who had somewhat
involuntarily left the dear old mother country. Mr.
D. mixed up some brass and gold filings and
told Governor Phillip that he had found a gold-
mine, The attempted imposition failed, and
in the words of the historian White, “ Instead of
receiving a reward for his gold discovery he was
taken into ous ody and examined with great
privacy and strictness, and no satisfactory eTue*-
dation being obtained from him, he was ordered
to be severely whipped. Subsequent to this
punishment—of which he was prepared to expect
a weekly repetition between the intervals of hard
labour—it was also ordered that be should be
loaded with heavy irons during the time of his
remaining in the colony." But even this did not
cure Mr. Dailey, who afterwards re-told his story
to a stern military man named Johnston, who
speedily caused him to recant by threatening to
put a bullet through him, and get him
flogged aga J n, Thereafter, when Mr. Da'ley
took his walks abroad, he bore the latter “ R ” on
his back. This may possibly afford a useful hint
to his Excellency when the mining fraternity put
him on toast one of these days.
A pathetic photograph is now being ex-
hibited ia the show-case of a Collins-street firm,
represents g the flower of ths Victorian aristocracy
fix ad up after what they fondly believe to ba
“ School for Scandal” fashion. Heaven forgive
them, for they know not what they did! The
ladies lock sweet, despite the trifling discrepancy
of a century between their headgear and their
Paris costumes, but the men —the male nobility—
are enough to make Sir Joshua Eeynolds rise from
his cold grave. The suppositious Charles Surface
sports a moustache in which many sparrows
might build their neats, Joseph carries a long
black beard, Sir Peter Teazle—in the person of
Baronet Clarke—looks historically inaccurate with
his usual moustache-beard combination. If any
man had told ns that Sir William, of Rnperts-
wood, was capable of wearing a powdered wig
with an unshaven phiz, we should have hurled
the horrid insinuation back at that man. In hta
everyday garb the only Victorian Baronet betrays
no want of taste, but rather a profound genius for
playing his part. He is neither 'orty, nor com-
manding, nor gorgeous In appearance—but he
looks peculiarly like a Baronet. Notone of Ouida’s
pattern, but a responsible British baronet of long
descent. The hang of Hsfrock-coat, the rim of his
bell-topper, the cut of hia trousers, and the ner-
vous jerk of hia hand as he walks along, make a
harmonious pic ura of old aristocracy. Sir Wil-
liam Clarke might be picked out from a crowd as
the beet-bred man among them, simply because
he wears his very unpretentious garments aa
though hia ancestors came over with the Con-
queror. His very method of faltering and fumb-
ling with a three lines speech is patrician in its
absurdity. Everything about him Is baronetty—
solid, heavy, dull, country-baronctty. Brassey
can’t kok distinguished worth a cent, as compared
with Clarke, and even Baron Bob (whose title dees
date back to the days of William Pitt) Is quite a
tawdry kind of “ toff” beside the butcher’s eldest
son. Many people don’t understand how wide a
social gulf separates Clarke from the horde of
knights who just live and die and leave no handle
behind them. But if he did get his exceptional
“honour” by a fluke, let us find comfort in the
fact that this o' herwise unremarkable personage
carries it as though to ths manner bern. There,

The Imperialistic policy of conferring
hereditary titles on penniless men is developing a
race of beings who are compelled to live upon
their wits. The Canterbury title was given to
the first holder because he had been Speaker of
the House of Commons. He had no land, and but
his pension to live on. The third holder of the
title is now an insolvent debtor. The St Leonards
title was given because the first holder —whose
lather was a barber—was a successful pol'tical
lawyer, and became Lord Chancellor of England,
also landless, and the present holder— he is pretty
we’ll known in Australia. A few days ago a
baronet died in Surry Hills in obscure circum-
stances, and we hear of another earning a preca-
rious livelihood in a neighbouring colony as a
commission-agent. This little gentleman is vain
of his title, if not of his business, and it is funny
to read a memo, after this fashion—“ Memo, from
Sir Samuel Snooks, Bart., to Timothy Twiddle.
Have a patent mangle for sale. Will suit your
missus. Time-payment; half-a-crown a week.”
And we lately heard of an Irish Karl keeping a
pub. cn the Hocks, Sydney. Verily, the unlanded
gentry of England is becoming a by-word in the
colonies.

Qaong Tart, the well-known and popular

Qaong in his own land a rank equivalent to that

Qaong’s altered status, now cordially says : “How

The gifted “ Humming Bee ” speaks in
the social columns of Sydney D, T. :
In town one's friends live in all sorts of impossible
suburbs. They each have their “days," and if one did one's
visiting duty it would be necessary to drive round and round
perpetually, appearing at the Glebe on Monday for Lady A s
reception day, at Randwiok on Tuesday for Mrs. B s. at the
North Shore on Wednesday to call on Mrs, C,
road on Thursday for Lady I), and back again to Glebe
Point on Friday for Mrs. E.
“ Humming Bee ” evidently moves in the highest
“suckles” when she puts two titled females into
a list of five acquaintances, and the cheese-
mongers’ wives who read the D.T. are no doubt
equally select. Curiously enough, too, the social
difficulty of which she complains has occurred to
us also on more than one occasion, and as we were
corning down on top of the omnibus yesterday
morning we remarked on it to a duke who was
sitting beside us, and he was so much struck with
the justice of our observation that he repeated it
to the lord inside. We didn't quite catch the
lord’s full title, but the duke called him “Bill,”
Perhaps “Humming Bee’s ” friend is Lady Bill.

(Melb.), one night last week, whan he came upon
a swest young couple, the children of swagger
people in East Melbourne, who were carrying on
in tha usual way, and that was all. ‘ ‘ Taffy ”
couldn’t run them in for “insulting behaviour”
or bad conduct, for they weren’t doing either, bub
he created a little offence to meet the case, and
charged the loving pair with “ Indiscreetness, ’
and forthwith proceeded to take the ! r names. The
fair one prayed aud besought that Taffy wouldn’t
expose her, and at length the copper was mel ed.
He “reserved judgment,” eg he observed the
judges did sometimes, and told the fair maid that
if she met him by moonlight alone, or under tha
street-lamp at the Richmond Post-cfflee the next
night he would give his decision in her case. In
the meantime, the young pair made a clean breast
of the whole affair to their pa’s aud ma's, aud the
next night Taffy waited in vain under the lamp-
post opposite Sheehy’s pub. for his fair but indis-
creet friend. The pa’s kicked up a deuced row

The nasty little Adelaide Lantern grows
blandly sarcastic :
The p:ople over in N.B.W. have gushed consumedly over
the Centennial celebrations, but the climax was reached
when Sir 'Eory Parkes, “ our venerable statesman,” exposed
his bare poll, like the knob of a wooden gate-post, to the
searching rays of the suu—the rays searched, but they could
not get a clue to anything in that ostrich egg—and Lady
Oarington theatrically held her sunshade over Parkes’ poll,
in order that tha sun might not waste its rays in a vaiu at-
tempt to warm up the Parkesian intellect The crawlers and
the sycophants straightway cheered, and the mob followed
suit because a mob always does follow a noise. The mob
would have cheered with equal enthusiasm if lady Oarington
had bounced an orange off the polished nut cf their vene--
able fraud. A mob hcs no more idea of the fitness of thir gs

According to a Northern paper, the Rev.
B. Griffith, father of Sir Psalmy ell Griffith, was
the first full-blown white clergyman in Aus ralia
who celebrated the marriage-sfrvloe between a
kanaka and a white woman. Years ago, two oily
brown vagabonds humped Ham’s anathema over
the sunny plains of Queensland, till at last they
“brought up” In Biisbane, and each mashed a
simple maiden from England ard asked her to
come along to his island home They both said
they were princes in tirair own country, and the
two little English dressmakers—who, having
been brought up under monarchical institutions,
were Prince-worshippers and Queen-worshippers
—were to have a throne and a crown apiece, and
a big palace and servants innumerable, and cocoa-
nuts without end, end ten thousand slaves to
wallop, and were to live in appalling style and
have ten new frocks every day. It never occurred
to the girls to ask why the owners of all this
magnificence were mending fences in a foreign
land instead of wearing diamonds and pearls and
golden socks, and boots studded with topazes;
they closed with the offers right away, and the
reverend gentleman in Brisbane blessed their
union and they sailed for their island kingdom in
the South Seas. But when they got there, there
were no crowns and no palaces, and instead
of sitting cn a throne they bad to hoe yams
about 16 hours a day, and the whole bril-
liant dream buret Into shivers. In piece of
getting ten new frocks every day their
clothes were annexed ly sundry brown girls
whom their husbands elevated to the throne
which should have been theirs, and the tbrone
only consisted of an upside-down kerosene tin
after all. There weren’t ten thousand slaves in
the whole place, and the few who were there wal-
loped the white women and made them fetch
water for then 1 , and there wasn’t a diamond in
the entire archipelago—only a fragment of a
smashed tumbler. Months afterwards a trading
captain managed to carry away two broken down
white girls, who were sick cf hoeing yams v ith
next to nothing on them, and of being knocked
about by a pair of native princes, who stole their
own boots and threw them at their heads. Their
husbands objected strongly, and chased them wi h
various agricultural implements, but they reached
Sydney in safety, and their crowns are now
vacant. Australian girls who hanker after the
aristocracy should take warning by their fate. It
is better to live peacefully In a shanty at Is. 6d. a
week than to be hauled round by the hair by a
monarch or a duke—whether In the Cannibal
Islands or in the “ dear old mother country.”

An Australian lady is shaking her bustle

she can he of anything in the whole world, my
dear, “ that we cannot expect to be fully under-
stood by a man who comes here for only a few
months, and moves in the higher circles of
societv.” The argry lady is not very wide of
the mark. A parson who spends his time in
silent prayer, earnest exhortation, and visits to
squatters’ town residences, wouldn’t learn much
about our wonderful land except the number of
sheep it carries during a good season. When

corn, ard wine, and oil to keep up hfs strength

Gracious Qaetn, whi’e the representative woman
wore bookmaker’s rings, and gesticulated with
ungloved hands in railway carriages. He also
found that it was a custom of the country to own

A tall, willowy spinster, scarce of hair and
teeth, and 38, if a day, who lives with her brother
In a sparsely-settled suburb just without Mel-
bourne, is now getting about again after suffering
a shock to her nervous system fierce enough to
disturb the equanimity of a stuffed horse. The
lady keeps house for her brother, who is some-
thing in the city, and often enough on fine after-
noons, when her work was done, she would take
something of Ouida’s and in the shade of a tree
growing In an adjacent paddock would sib and
commune with wild young men of noble birth end
godlike proportions One warm day last month,
as she was thus employed, came a bold, mala
creature and sate him down by her side and
engaged her in gentle converse. He was tall
and beautiful as a Grecian hero, his tones were
soft and low, and ill-concealed admiration shone
in his expressive eye. The timid little heart cf
the spinster promptly went off the regulation
beat and bobbed and wobbled at an alarming
gait. She had almost despaired of being sought
in wedlock, but hope springs eternal in the old
maid’s breast, and the thought that perchance the
long-sought suitor had come nude her as skittish
and uncertain as an unbroken filly. The bold
young man crowded up closer and tcld her in
tremulous tones that he had long admired her
from a distance. Whilst she giggled and sim-
pered and nibbled the covers off her book he
secured her hard, and as the blood mantled his
pale cheeks he told her with fervent accent and
passionate gesticulation that he adored her ; he
pleaded that she might not look coldly upon him,
but give him one glsam cf hope ; he asked her to
be his, to fly with him to a distant land, and
relga in a sumptuous palace befitting her queenly
graces. Never was maiden wooed with such
passionate fervour, such pestle ardour. The
beautiful sentiments flowed like a poem from the
lips cf the handsome suitor, but the spinster only
giggled and wriggled, and said “ Oh, go along,
do I” He told her that he was the eon of an Earl,
and a direct descendent of Juliui Caesar aud Mary
Queen of Scots; he said he had a million a year,
seven gold mines, and a tannery, and that hla
bonny bark floated on the waters of the bay, wait-
ing to bear his lovely bride to fairer lands. Tnen
he clasped her closer, and pres.-ei a kiss, hot frem
the oven, right on her virgin rase; and, with a
sigh of satisfaction, the fairy creature rested her
head upon his bosom, and let him do it some
more. It was a moment of glorious triumph, but,
alas 1 it was short-lived; two rough men cams
over the hill, and, as the maiden revelled in the
luxury of the caresses lavished by her beauteous
suitor, they bore down upon the youth, and
scruffed him, and asked her, hearts hly, “ wot she
was a-doiu’with that ’e.-e pa hunt ? ’ They told
her that her gay gallant was an escapee from the
Kew Lunatic Asylum, and thathe had a penchant
for proposing to every womm he mst. He had
proposed to his grandmother and 700 strange
females oa various occasions. They kept a dress-
maker’s dummy In the asylum which he proposed
to ten or eleven times a day when he was well.
When last the two rough men saw the spinster,
as they bore their “paehunt” over the hill, she
was lunging at high heaven with her heels, and
crying “He he I ha ha I ho, ha-o-o-o-o I” in loud
and agitated tones.

descendants of her who “ d d us all for a bite
of a golden pippin?” In this connection
there is one thing only which is remarkable and
that Is that the fair dames stop to cub the pictures
cub. We have seen the alleged journals, and
there are so many pictures in them of long-legged
marquises with phenomenal “ mustiveys,” and
slim figures in shooting-jackets, surmounted by
aristocratic frontispieces, crowned with the wealth
of brown abundant curls, my dear, and such a
wealth of fictional interest centreing round the
wicked duke with the glittering eye and the coral
lips, that the forbearance of the ladles in nob
making a single meal of the entire affair deserves
praise, not censure.

Oscar Wilde need to tell this tale, wl ich
he had receivi d from the chief actress in i- h . It
was at the time of the prosecution by Mrs.
Langtry and Mrs Cornwallis West of the low
London print, Town Talk, for asserting that the
respective spouses of these two dear creatures
were about to institute divcrce prcceedings in
which the Prince of Wales would figure as a co-
respondent, and all London was agog in the mat-
ter. Ib happened that at this juncture Mrs.
Langtry, at a certain dinner party, sat next that
late-lamented bilious prig, Prince Leopold, who
presently opened proceedings by saying in a freezy
tone: “Do ycu know, Mrs. Langtry, that my
mortaw Is very much annoyed by your name
being coupled with my brothaw’s in this way ? ”
The Lily was a litt’e taken aback, but responded
quietly : “Da you know, Prince Leopold, that my
husband is very much annoyed at the Prince if
Wales’ name being coupled with mine in this
way ? ” It was the Prince’s turn to be taken
aback now, but he came up equal to the occasion
with: “ Yas, Mrs. Langtry, but it is different
with you and with my brothaw!" And the
whole table sat listening with awe, as the
Lily guilelessly replied, “Yes, Prince Leopold,
for he is accustomed to it and lam not /” The

A N.Z, paper announces that a gi 1 in its
neighbourhood has discovered the only thoroughly
effective way of suppressing the colonial masher.
A young gentleman sighted a pretty girl in the
park and requested a kiss —what is more, too, he
got it. The young lady backed up t gainst a tree,
took out her handkerchief, solemnly wiped
his mouth, and then let him take it. Then she
wiped her mouth several times. Somehow, all
the pleasure was knocked out of the performance,
and, after taking one imprint of her lips, he went
away to think the matter over.

Sc me years ago, the Australian Cold-watt r
Party imported a bald-headed Yankee named Eli
Johnson to lecture against the accursed drink.
Eli did, and piled up the dollars in doing I’. His
lecture consisted of an exposure of the adultera-

sixpence per copy, a neat little pamph’et contain-
ing some hundreds of recipes for mak'ng liquors
out of “almost nothing.” Another fat headed
temperance lecturer was lately on the warpath in
the back blocks, ard bis advent was hailed with
delight by the publicans of a certain little scorched
township, the reason heir g that they wanted seme
more methods of making cheap grog. One of these
states that shoe he got a copy of Eli Johnson s

in London as an anonymous poet, the author of
the “Love Poems of Prcteus.” These are a
series of irr.gular sonnets descriptive of Wil-
frid's amours with several charming ladies, one
of whom is his wife, the delightfully insouciant
Lady Betty Blunt. Wilfrid was a Piccadilly
lounger of the Laurence OFphant type, and Lord
Lytton said in the Nineteenth Century that
his little book cf poems was the best of thtir sort
since Heine. The frontispiece of them is a sketch
by the author representing him buttoned up to the

The fact that the Earl of Durham has
accused Sir George Chetwyod of “turf mal-
practices ” is a scandal merely on account of the
unsavoury reputations of the parties, otherwise
there would ba no more in it than the “ blowing
of the gaff” by a tinker cn a bottle-dealer. Sir
George Chetwynd is the man who had a fight with
virtuous Lord Lonsdale—Mrs. Langtry being the
casus belli The Earl of Durham achieved
celebrity by trying to prove that his wife was a
lunatic on her wedding-day, and failing to sub-
p’antiate the self-incriminating statement. Two
such worthies might go on accusing one another
of thir gs for a week, without getting half through

Misther Donovan, of Wellington (N.Z.),

“I kem home at midnight, yer honner," he said,
“and I found her prefer din’ to be ill, an’ a baste

Says London Life : -
Mr. John Smith’s recent legacy of £lOO,OOO to Lord Caring-
ton will come in very rpportuneiy, and should effectually
place that popular nobleman on his legs again It is not
every man in Lord Caringtou s position, one of the chief
favourites of the Marlborough Reuse “ inner set," and
courted and run after by the very cream of London society,
who would have had the courage to gracefully accept the in-
evitable and retire for a decade to the outer desolation of a
Colonial pro-Ooisulship, in order to allow a once magnifi-
cent property time to recoup. It is all the more to Lord
Carington’s credit that he has adapted himself with wonder-
ful adroitness to his new surroundings, and earned golden
opinions from all classes of the community in the colonies.
Thanks to good Mr. Smith, Lord and Lady Carington will
now soon be in a position to return to England and resume
their place in London society.
This, of course, is sheer nonsense, as it is well
known at Potts Point that Lord Carington came
to N.S.W. to spend £50,000 a year, beside his
official screw, and show people how to do things
properly.

The S.M. Herald’s English special cor-

with Wa’es. He mentions the fact in his paper
A friend of mine who went to superintend some theatrical
entertainments at Sandringham was lodged at a cottage on
the est.te ; in ths everiug the Prince walked with him to his
lodging, smoki g and chatting; and, parting with him for
the nignt, emptied his c’gar-caee into his guest s pocket, and
recommended him a particular brand of whisky for his
“ nightcap.”

A CONVERSATION OVERHEARD IN
PITT-STREET
No, thanks! I never go in for gold or silver
mines. At the best, if alls square, they are but
lotteries. I like something solid and sure. The
shares of the Australasian Trust Management
Company are my only fancy. No.hing like them
for safe and increasing dividends. I took 1000 of
their first issue early lass year. Can’t get any
more of them, so I m going in for 200 of iheir £5
Guaranteed Preference Shares.
Guaranteed shares ? Wha are they ?
Why, ycu pay one-fouth (£1 5 .) per share in
cash, or by instalments of Is. per share per month,
and if you have houses, or land, tr shares, or
deposit receipts or cash, you can deposit your
deeds, shares, deposit receipts or cash as
a guarantee for the haance of £3 15s. per
share, and you continue tr occupy your house, or
to draw sour rents cr dividends, or interest pay-
able as usual on your deposited secuiitles ; crif
you guarantee by deposit of caah you draw in-
tereso thereon at Current Btnk Rates, receiving
also, in any case, a bonus of *2 per cent, ptr
annum on the amount so guaranteed, together
with a share of profits on aid from payment up
of the £1 os. per share. And you may change or
withdraw your security as pleasure.
Why, ho v can they afford to give a bonus of £2
per cent, on money they cannot employ ?
Well, you see, as they need a tig capital to
secure a special Act of Parliament and the con-
fidence of trustees, it's easier to get cut a la-ge
capital in this way, for there are thousands who,
having houses, land, or other securities, are glad
to make a second profit on them ; atd it's cheaper
to give a bonus of £2 per cent, than to pay a high
rate of dividend oa a large pria-up capital, so
shareholders and company are botn benefited;
and while the public have the guarantee of an un-
doubted capita], the company, cei g able to afford
such a solid security, attracts a good basin ess, and
makes a good return on the part paid up.
It ssems ail right; but I never heard of such
shares before !
Oh ! guaranteed shares are common in Holland
and the Cape, and you know the old Du'ch finan-
ciers are safe, long-headed fellows ; and I don’t
suppose anyone would object to follow their
good example, and make a second profit on their
securities when they have tte chance.
Well, no, if it’s safe.
Safe! Why “ trust management ’’ business is
at once tie safest and most profitable of businesses
—nothing like it for safety, and nothing has ever
equaled it for large and constantly increasing
dividends.
That’s a strong assertion. .
Well it’s true —nothing more true. You see,
being only an agency business a trust company
has no risk ; audits trainees once well started
increases as testa!ors die off to an extent which
must y eld an amount of business on which to
draw commissions very many, mar y times in ex-
cess of its capital. Toe profl sof every business
depend on doi g the largest amount of business
on the smal eat possible capital, and Trust Manage-
ment business gives this chance in the highest de-
gree.
What will they pay ? You seem to have studied
the matter.
Weil, you know I’m cautious. I r ever go in for
anything with my eyes shut, but why I know so
much abcut the matter is—you remember meeting
Mcller at my house about threj years since, when
he was on a visit to the Cape— vt ell, he expressed
turpriso that v e had no Trust Management Com-
pany here ; couldn't do without them at the Cape
he said. He told me of several friends who, or
whose widows, are now drawirg enormous divi-
derds which lad increased in 30 j ears from £8 to
£3OO per cent,, and more in one case.
That seems too good to be true.
Well, it is true ; but it has taken time, of couk e
—it’s the growth of business over many years. He
toffi me no Trust Company has ever gone wrong,
they can’t go wrong, they all make steady progress.
What has been doie at the Cape and in Melbourne
can surely be done here. Why net 1
One would think so I didn’t know they had
any such oompa ies in Melbourne.
Oh, yes, and all doing well ; one already pays
£2O per cent.
What do you expect to make?
I calculate on a certain £8 per cent, perhaps
£lO, as soon as the ccmpary gets its capital, and
I am sure I am within the mark in locking for an
increase of at least £2 per cent, per annum ; so
1 hat my wife, when I’m under the turf, will get
say 30 per cent oa my £lOOO, cr £3OO a year.
Well, it’s all very well for you, J nes —youv’e
houses and cash to depcsit—you’re a man ot capi-
tal ; I’ve no deeds to deposit. I’ve only a few
hundreds to h ve t
Ihen£l “Preference” shares, the third issue
of this company, will just suit your pocket Sub-
scribe for a few of them, and ycu will certainly
make money. You have no need to guarantee
them. They no ay be paid up in fall, *r to ss.
only, ah your option, and by monthly instalments
oi one shilling. They bear a preferer ce dividend
of £6 par cent pgr annum from payment of ss.
per share, and wi 1 certainly pay the biggesb divi-
dend ever known in a few yea a time. Take 500
for yours a] f and the wife and 100 apiece for the
children. 1 hey II ba the best provision for them.
They’ll be at a good premium in a few months, I’ll
bet. Take as many as you can and you'll never
regret lb.
Well, I think I’ll take your advice and leave
the “ Squatter Hills ” alone and go in for 500 £1
preference shares of “ The Australasian Trust
Management Cj.” Where’s their office ? .

SLAIN WITH A STONE.
No one can read the story of the youthful David,
with his simple sling and stones from the brook,
going out to meea the boastful Goliath In the pre-
sence of two armies and destroying him, without a
thrill of admiration at his bravery and prowess.
And yetsmaller stones than David used to despatch
the giant have since silently slain thousands.
The Rev. N. Pattinson, of Kcchester, Victoria,
suffered for three years from stone in the bladder.
He says his life was becoming one of misery,
and he had thought seriously of giving up the
work of the ministry, when fortunately Warner’s
safe cure was bought under hia notice by a clerical
friend, the Rev. S, P. Webber, and he took the
medicine with such good results that a stone was
pasred away, and a speedy restoration to health
followed Mr. W. F. Davies, of 5 Kennoway
Terrace, Rose Street. Darlington, Sydney, N.S.W.,
suffered more or less with stone in the bladder for
It years. Last December an operation was per-
formed on him, for crushing the stone, and for the
succeeding two months he was confined to his bed,
and in a condition mote dead than alive, and gave
up all hope of recovery. At this time he was
reoomended to try Warner’s safe cure and Warner’s
safe pills. He did so, and after taking nine bottles,
which eliminated large quantities of gritty matter,
he entirely recovered; gained three stone in weight
and is co-day a living monument to the efficacy of
the medicines mentioned Mr Samuel Hosking,
or Gill-street, Charters Towers Q., was also cured
of a s )vere attack of gravel with Warner’s safe
cure Such testimony is beyond controversy. The
gentlemen mentioned will gladiy verify every state-
ment we have made. *

Gentlemen, —I have great pleasure In recom-
mending Row’s D anelion Bitters. 1 have been
Buffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for It without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man, I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them,—
Yours,
Tamworth, August 31, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned i—
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, Indigestion, pain in the ohest, general de-
bility. feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of

Row’s Steane’s Wine
1b a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex
or children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
Row’s Steane’s Wine.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. YOUNG, LADIES can take
this when suffering from general debility. It’s
only a pure tonic. Try it.
READ CERTIFICATE RESPECTING ITS
PURITY.
“ Having carefully examined a bottle of ROW’S
‘ STBANB”S' WINE, manufactured by Edward
Row and Company, I consider them a very whole-
some tonic, suitable for persons suffering from
weak digestion, being perfectly free from any in-
jurious chemicßs, too often used in such prepara-
tions. They should become a favorite drink in
these warm climates.
(Signed) JOHN M’KILLOP, analyst.
“ Sydney, December 23, 1881.”
Row’s Steane’s wine
has also weaned many persons from the excessive
use of ardent spirits.
TEETOTALLERS will find this newly-Invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
Instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

A “respectable widow” advertises In
Sydney E. Nooze for “a husband, open a week.”
At the end of that time, if he fails to turn up, she
will take a boarding-house.
Overheard iu Ihe dress circle of Sydney
Theatre Royal. Rupert: “ Well, Bob, how did
this af eraoon’s race ?,io a pass off?” Bob: “Oh,
pre ty wad. Government House looked like a

Pastor Thomas Spurgeon, of Auckland,
N.Z —the original Spurgeon in London always
called himself “ Pastor,” and the term runs in
tne family now —committed matrimony the other
day. H s accomplice was Miss Rutherford, of
Dunedin.
Henry Collier, the Melbourne pressman
(brother of George Collier, the actor), who died
the other day ia Melbourne, had many reverses
and adventures in life. A quarter of a century
ago he was a reporter on th=) Age and dramatic
critic for the Leader (the weekly Age) under the
nom de plume of “Autolycus.” Afterwards he
beca r e sub edit r of the Age, and later rn of the
Evening Herald, Then tub. of the D.T., and
afterwards a r -porter on the E.H. After this he
drifted off the press and became a railway gate-
keeper out Caulfle’d way at 30s. a week. He
then took a readership on the age, and died in
harness —or rather “reading" a galley of elegies
and epitaphs fi r the mortuary columns of the
paper. Harry was succ eded as gatekeeper by
Cornelius Mulcany, the county-court bailiff of 35
years standing, who, in years gone by, when
Collier “did” the county court, used to give Henry
queer paragraphs picked up in the course of his
business as a bum. One morning poor Con. Mul-
cahy was on the line when a train sneaked up un-
awares, and a few minutes later when they went
to look for him he couldn’t be found. Some frag-
ments of a foxy beard were picked up on the per-
manant way, and that was all.
That dignified and decorous Victorian
Judge, the late Sir Redmond Barry, once had a
case before him in which plaintiff sought to re-
cover damages for injury to a flack of sheep by
the stampede of a mob of cattle. A very staid,
respectable-looking sheep station-overseer was in
the witness box, and his appearance and manner
had quite taken the Judge’s fancy. In his usually
halting way, Micbie, Q C., who was examining him,
put the question : “ Now, having had 20 years’
experience as a station-overseer, will you be good
enough to tell his Honor and the jury what the
effect would he of a mob of cattle charging a mob
of sheep, as these cattle are described to have
done here ? ” Rep’led the staid and pious looking
witness : “It would play h with them.’ 1
Had the reigning sovereign in Steel suddenly
presented himself in court the astonishment could
not have been greater. Michle coughed behind
his hand, and M'Donald, the very open-visaged
court-crier, stuffed his “ wipe ” into his mouth,
while Barry, ala:o it choking with rage, roared
out : “ Sir, you must net imagine you are in a
stock yard now. You are in the Supreme Caurt
of this colony, and unless you a»-e very careful
you will And yourself in the adjoining gaol.” The
witness humbly apologised.
The T. and C. Journal professes to give
a biography of the w 11-known Australasian book-
seller and publisher, George Robertson, but is
evidently not well peated in ihat enterprising
gentleman's care r and the method by which he
managed to create the colossal business he now
directs. Before he migrated to the big store in
Eiizabeth-st eet, Melbourne - next the old Age
tfiice—G. R. had a Email shop in Colllns-street,
immediately opposite the Argus office, and
acquired his great Australian reputation by simple
business tact and watchfulness. While a'l the
old book-stores tf Melbourne were crammed with
literature unsuitable to Australian readers and
shipped by agents who had never been out of the
sound of “Bo 9? Bells,” George’s London represen-
tatives were men who had gained exparienoe
bahiod the Melbourne counter, and well knew
the wants of the colonists. After a service of
three years these were recalled and their
places supplied with others from Australia ; thus
“dead” stock at stock-taking was an unknown
quantity. A few years ago G. R. brought his big
business under the Companies’ Act in £ shares,
but, finding he con d not work it as advantageously
as when solely in his own hands, he bought up all
the shares at a premium, and is now sole owner
of the largest book business in the Southern
hemisphere.

THE land is the best ever yet submitted by
subdivision around Melbourne, and it is
admittedly the acme and perfection of 'he most
fashionable, the healthiest, the most charming,
and the most romantic spot of Toorak, which, it
is needless to say, stands without a rival amongst
the suburbs of Melbourne. The Estate, which is
surrounded by Mansions, has a beautifully pano-
ramic view. For accessibility to the City the
Estate excels all other fashionable residential sites.
By road it is about miles from the Post-office;
by rail it is considerably less. The Glen Iris R it-
way branches off fram Burnley, and after travel-
ling one mile and three-quarters reaches the Rah-
way Station to be erec ed on Mr. Fergmon’s pro-
perty at the Glenferrie-rcad. This St itioa is two
minutes’ walk from the GREAT TOORAK
ESTATE. By rail the Ci y will ba reached fr m
your breakfast-table comfortably in Mte. n
minutes. The Toorak Tram, now in course of
construction, will take you from the heart of the
City to within eight minutes’ walk of the Estate
for Threepence, and the omnibuses from the Tram
Terminus to Malvern pass the Estate. Gas and
water laid on. Drags surd Conveyances will meet
Intending purchasers at South Yarra Station.

T IT AGAIN.
Plain reading, but freighted with material,
solid mean log.
Onr successors have depended largely upon bold
essay and extraordinary enterprise. No firm can
boldly declare prie s unl.ss they feel thoroughly
that they mean bus! io?s and are de erminel to
give bargains that make those who rtap thj ad-
vantages declare promptly and Immediately : -
That they are astonished That they are
pleased. That ih°y are astounded. That they
are gratified.
And can we do it ? Ah ! Can we do It ? Can
anyone else so boldly dec’are that they can bene-
fit the public. That’s the important part of It.
Well, we can do it. We can benefit tna public.
We can help them to benefit themselves. And
we recognise this important fact, that we cannot
hope to have the encouraged business thac has
been our blessed share unless we so'idly, clearly,
and unmtsakably give evidence of our ability.
We have proved ourselves eminently superior to
a’l competitors in the many special departments
upon which we have ventured. And we ask—
Who can sell Furniture with us ?
Who can sell Upholstery w'th us?
Who can sell Bedsteads with us ?
Who can sell Bedding with us ?
Who can sell Ironmongery with us ?
Who can eell Glassware with us ?
Who can sell Chinaware with us ?
Who can tell Electroplated Ware with us ?
Who can seil Earthenware with us ?
Who can sell Carpets with us ?
Who can se I Drapery with us ?
Who can sell Underclothing with us ?
Who can sell Corsets and Gloves with us
Who can sell Linens with us?
Who can ssll Clothing with us ?
Who can S;IT Hats with us?
Who can sell Mercery with us ?
Who can sell Gen's,’ Underclothing with us?
Who can sell GTothos with us ?
Who can sell Boots with us ?
Who can se 1 Shoes with ns ?
Who can sol l Laces with us ?
Who can sell Bays’ Boots with us ?
Who oan sell Boja’ Trousers and Vests with us?
Who can sell Youths’ Clothes with us ?
Who can give better value than wa ?
And perhaps in this last line the kernel of the
commercial nut may bo found cent-ed.
WBLl», HEBE IS THE SECRET ! - Content with
small profits, knowing that we must sell cheap,
WE ARE BOUSD TO DO OUR LEVEL BEST
TO KEEP OURSELVES BEFORE THE
PUBLIC ; and keep before them ve will, it the
very heavens should fall.
BEDS IBAOS—
When in the public press it is noticed that LA.W-
LERS’ have a sale on, then let the Lord help all
essayists for the dajs of profits are numbered.
Holding 27,000 Bedsteads and Cots in
stock, there is no firm in this or the old
world can turn out eo many bedsteads of
a kind as we can.
Last October ne were deluged with country-
customers requesting our bargain parce’s. Tne
town and suburbs were at it from neon till night.
The nine vans were as busy bees delivering north,
Eouth, east and west AND W 3!? Because we
offered bargains like the following IN BED-
STEADS : We essayed and submitted immense
Four-post a-d Half tester Tabular Doable Bed-
steads, together with wove wire mattress, together
with hair mattress, together with hair bolster,
together with two feather pillows, and we swore
we’d let the lot go as ounding as the value is—
we swore v e'd let the lot go at £6 12s, 61, al-
though worth £lO 17s. 6d , tho same lines.
Our immense assortment of. bedsteads, the
numerous styles, the various s zes, preclude a
clear statement of lints, but the lot aforesaid
clearly proves our ability to show marvellous
value throughout the house Remember, wa do
not choose a claptrap line to endeavour to prove
value. We went straight away for ono of our
beat lines and quoted it at our lowest price.
We would be wanting in our generosity to
single men were we to omit to quote the follow*
log extraordinary lines :
Single Bedsteads, either half-tester or four-post.
Palliasses for same.
Heavy Flock Mattress fer same.
Flock Bolster and Kapok Pillow.
The lot for £2 7s. 6J., well worth £2 12s.
Tula fate Is meant to be another of oar SPECIAL
THINGS, so that we must touch furalme And
in touching furniture we would quote special
lines :
Chests of Drawer?, for instance, 255., 355.,

T> HEUMATI3M VANISHES BEFORE IT
In proof whereof the Glasgow Herald, of
October 15, 1887, cites the following cases
Mr. Edward Peterson, electric light engineer, of
3G, Whetstone Pork, London, W.C., says:—
“ Thera can be no two opinions respecting the
value of St. Jacobs oil as a rheumatic remedy. I
was so completely used up with rheumatism in
my arms and shoulders that I was unable to at-
tend to my business. I was advised by a friend
to use St. Jacobs oil. A few good rubbings with
that famous oil drove all pain away from me. I
never saw anything like it.”
For four months Miss Marion Clifford, of the
Golden Cross, Porter-street, Hull, lay In bed with
inflammatory rheumatism. Her feet and ankles
were badly swollen, and her sufferings were in-
tense, no treatment affording any relief, until St.
Jacobs oil was applied, when a complete cure was
at once effected.
Mrs. G. Angold, 7 Maude read, London, was
afflicted with chronic rheumatism for four years.
She found no relief from medicines, atd was in-
duced to use St. Jacobs oil. One application re-
duced the swelling of the ankles atd knees, and
two more applications removed all pain.
Mr. Henry John Brrlow, of i Staples Innbuild-
ings, Holborn Bars, London, W.C., says:—“Re-
cently, during rainy woather, I contrasted a very
severe cold by wetting my feet, which resulted in
rheumatism in my feet and legs, which became so
bad that I was hardly able to walk. Learning
from a friend the value of St, Jacobs oil, I had a
bottle procured, the contents cf which applied
with several rubbings removed all rheumatic pain
atd completely cured me,”

While he is in debt for board,
With its second hand split and a top to it

In the ranks of Michael and G.

A CENTENNIAL INNOVATION.
Complaints having been made by ladies that their dresses are constantly being expectorated
upon by the occupants of the hurricane-decks of the Sydney tram cars, a scheme is here suggested
which will prevent any further repetition of such occurrences, and, at the same time, help to
bring about that long-desired consummation, the laying of the dust in front of the motor. The
subject, though not a nice one, nevertheless, requires immed'a'e attention.
I Sir C. G. Daffy is writing a biography of
his friend and co-founder of the Nation, Thomas

a cold caught after a sculling-matoh. A life size

Rather a rapid change in Sydney D.T.’a
opinion on glove-fighting took place last week :
Friday, the 10th, says,
in speaking of the
coming Foley Burke
match: —
It is provided that they
shall fight ‘ to a finish," the
plain English of which is that
the two men will batter each
other about until one or other
drops exhausted rr incapaci-
tated. In other words it is
to be a prize-fight with lightly
padded gloves.
Saturday, the 11th,
enthusiastically says:—
A good programme of box-
ing events is arranged for
decision at Foley’s to-night,
and some splendid sport is
promised. The principal item
is a fight to a finish between
Smitheis and Donaldson, and
as rumour says both have
been in training for some
time, a stubbornly-contested
engagement may be antici-
pated. [The italics are ours ]
And what the D T. is with regard to prize-fighting
it ia with regard to everything else under the sun.

The latest shark-stories are to the effect
that the Poit Jackson and Grafton sharks have
taken to chasing wager-beats—this, no doubt, with
the view of putting down “champion” sculling
by third class scullers. The otter day Burke, the
fighting-man, was out in a wager-boat at Grafton,
and was pursued by a monster which followed
him into shallow water and bit his boat when he
abandoned it. Sculler Nelson, while out pulling
near Ryde, Parramatta River, a little while ago,
was followed by a big shark which amused itself

Mons. Victor suggests that a cricket-match

The men who know everything say that
before Kemp’s match with Clifford a trial spin was
rowed on the Nepean between Beach, Kemp, and
Neilson, the two former allowing Neilson the start
he is to get from Hanlan in their forthcoming
match. They never caught Neilson, and Beach
could not shake Kemp off. If this is true, Mr.
Hanlan will have a merry time in his matches
against Neilson and Kemp. All the same, if the
form shown by Kemp against Clifford was any
guide, Hanlan can beat either of them “ the
length of a street.”

The other day a Southern sport, who is
awake so early in the morning that he is supposed
to get up overnight, took a fancy to buy a certain
racehorse. He went to the owner, and they
agreed about the price, but the owner said that
he wanted to run the horse in a certain race for
which he was entered, and that he would deliver
him after that race. The buyer did not want the
horse to win that race, as it would spoil his chance
in future handicaps, but being a very smart man
he raised no objection, and even offered to let his
own jockey ride the horse. The owner
agreed, and the boy was put on, and, accord-
ing to the seller, never gave the horse a
chance to win—pulled his head off, in fact. Then
the owner saw the dodge and refused to deliver,
and all parties are calling one another nasty names.

Can Jack Burke—the Irishman, and not

fought recently with Godfrey, the coloured cham-

Those who paid a sovereign and half-a-
sovereign a-head to see the “ champion ” sculling
match between Clifford and Kemp on Saturday
got poor value for their money. Race it could
scarcely be called, as Kemp got a length to the
good at the start and leisurely increased it up to
the winning-post. Clifford rowed hard from
start to finish, but he was too slow at the start
of the stroke to put any life into his craft, and it
was with a heavy drag of his broad bladed
sculls that he pulled the stroke through. His
preliminary spurt was rather taking, but when
the procession started, in comparison with Kemp,
it was seen that his Herculean strength was
thrown away, and his boat went through the
water as if she had a kerosene-tin nailed to her
bottom. Kemp’s style, in contradistinction to
Clifford's, is full of life and grace and is so free
of labour that even when at his bast he does not ap-
pear to the onlooker to bo rowing hard. Should
Kemp and Hanlan come together, however, we
shall go for the Canadian. Allowing Kemp is as
fast as Hanlan —which the writer does not con-
sider him to be—the Australian has hitherto
shown that when pressed he drops across a weak
Spot, and Hanlan, by the desperate race he rowed
Beach on the Nepean, looks a likely man to find
that weak spot out.

six rounds, the other evening, but failed to do it.
Had Seale been in good condition he might have
reversed the order of things by knocking out
th b
Costello. Seale all through fought at a great dis-
advantage owing to a painful foul blow being
unintentionally struck by Costello in the second
round.
Ives, the deadhead colleague of Parkea in
the representation of Sb. Leonards, contributed 10
guineas to the latter's breadless ’ome fund. This
is a beastly small sum considering that Ives
sneaked into the ’Case under 'Eary’s coat-tails.
