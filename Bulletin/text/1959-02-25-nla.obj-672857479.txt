INTERNATIONAL BRIGADE
As New Australians continue to pour
into this country so do stories about
them increasingly make their way into
Coast to Coast; and the 1957-58 issue
of this Angus and Robertson anthology,
edited by Dal Stivens, has changed
from the familiar parade of Australian
themes to a sort of march of the Inter-
national Brigade.
Which is as it should be. Not only
does it show that the short-story
writers (and the editor) are alert to
changes and novelties in the Australian
way of life; but out of the stories
themselves, partly because of the more
volatile character of many Of the
European immigrants, the strangeness
of their customs and the drama of
their experiences, come new color and
force and variety.
Thus Roy Theodore’s “The Greek”
is about the Greek proprietor of a cafe
who, as the climax of a day of
exasperations, reproves a troublesome
customer by breaking a bottle of
tomato-sauce over his head; and then,
in a mollifying epilogue, is seen recalling
his far-off happy youth in his native
fishing-village. And S. Stedman’s “The
Stroke of a Master” is about a Jewish
match-maker, famous in his original
Russian village but out-of-place in
Australia till he gets an assignment to
find a husband for the fearsome
daughter of a co-religionist, a problem
which he ingeniously solves by marry-
ing the female himself and pocketing
both her dowry and his fee for finding
the husband.
John Morrison’s pugnacious “To
Margaret” is about a Dutch gardener
who, being in love with his employer’s
daughter, sows seeds in a flower-bed to
grow in the shape of her name; and
Lesley Rowlands’s “And What Part of
Europe Do You Come From?”,
though not one of the liveliest stories,
puts the new situation very well —the
migrants with their terrible experiences
in Europe, the Australian welfare-girl
(with a tragedy of her own, though she
doesn’t care to talk about it) left to
ponder the relative tragicality of a car-
accident and a European war.
Nor is it only an awareness of
Europe and European immigrants that
is reflected in this anthology. If it is
coincidence that has given us Mena
Kashmiri Abdullah’s “Grandfather
Tiger” and Ethel Anderson’s “A
Question of Habit,” it is an appro-
priate and fortunate coincidence: all
the more fortunate in that these are two
of the best stories in the book. Mena
Abdullah’s story is about the small
Indian girl, bom in Australia, who
keeps an imaginary tiger in the bottom
of the garden until the white girls
accept her at school and she no longer
needs him. “A Question of Habit”,
beautifully mature and easy, must date
back to the days when Ethel Anderson
lived in India and, dealing with a lady-
help who simultaneously administered
arsenic to the narrator and an aphro-
disiac to her husband, is a theme that
would have appealed to Somerset
Maugham.
Yet another story looking towards
the East is Clive Morton’s “The
Walnut Bed” which, though the end-
ing is a bit too tame, is a delightful
comedy about an old Chinese farmer
in an Australian country town who
wants a new young wife from China to
warm his bones —-he talks most
appealingly about the idea, but it does
not appeal to his sons.
But the native Australian Muse is
not, one is glad to note, entirely over-
whelmed in this flood of immigration.
Hugh Atkinson’s “The Jumping
Jeweller of Lavender Bay” a varia-
tion on the Little Man story, is as lively;
a variation as its title suggests —the
jeweller, for freedom’s sake, takes
longer and longer jumps at the ferry
each morning.
L. J. Blake’s very slight “Those Green
Trousers” deals feelingly with those
men’s-wear shops where there is no-
where to put your cigarette-butt and
fhe mirrors show how incredibly
shoddy your old suit looks. Flexmore
Hudson’s comedy of a country school-
teacher reads like a promising start
for a novel. E. O. Schlunke paints a
'businessman-farmer’s “Carnival” with
unsparing irony. Bernard Hesling is
surprising with a harmless smalltown
crank who murders his wife and child
and gives them “Christian burial” in
the backyard. And Les Robinson’s
“The Vine-dweller” which, along
with some other unacknowledged
stories, was first published in “The
Bulletin”: a good many years ago—is
quite as bizarre as anything that
could come to our shores from foreign
lands.
Dal Stivens has some surprising
omissions—-Hal Porter is the first who
comes to mind—and some equally sur-
prising inclusions: Frank Bryning’s
“Place of the Throwing-stick,” about
an aboriginal who attacks the “white-
man’s monster” at Woomera with a
boomerang, is decidedly magazinish,
and E. A. Gollschewsky’s “A Clear
Case of Self-defence” is an embarrass-
ing item from this accomplished
writer. But on the whole the selection
is rich, amusing and readable.
NEW AUSTRALIAN
Here to my summer acre sometimes comes
A thought of Europe, dwindled as this
moon,
Blinking her crystals out in waiting-rooms
And now hung over paddocks, white as
bone —
Much like the boy l buried. Even now
Driving a furrow, from the running shear
Bone flows and l am wrenched, in sun-
light plough
A lunar landscape whose lost ways led
here.
The furrow turns, memory goes under-
' ground
To wait its season. While this orchard
statids,
Let its white passion and full fruit ex-
pound
The ideology of these two hands,
That my son’s sons and daughters at their
ease
May watch the moonrise through old
apple-trees.

Two for Children
Christmas comes and goes with
inconceivable rapidity, and if this
review of Judith Wright’s Kings of the
Dingoes (Oxford) and Margaret Paice’s
The Lucky Fail (Angus and Robert-
son) is a bit late for 1958 at least it
should be nicely in time for Christ-
mas, 1959. Besides, children have
birthdays.
Judith Wright’s story is not as
remarkable as, from her poetry, one
might expect. It is not a new “Alice”
nor yet, though it seems to owe some
of its warmth to it, another “Magic
Pudding.” But it is simple, natural
and enjoyable and contains some
pleasant verses which, in their unpre-
tentiousness, are precisely fitted to the
occasion:—
When winter nights grow long and
black
And dogs in their kennels are fast
asleep,
Come out, come out with the dingo
pack
And follow the trail of a tasty sheep.
It is about two dogs, a pomeranian
and a red setter, who, left behind when

WEST NEW GUINEA
AN example of what little chance a
Government has to win the favor
of certain types of pressure-groups is
to be found in the uproar against the
attitude of R. G. Casey over West
New Guinea.
Dr. Subandrio, the Foreign Minis-
ter for Indonesia, was invited to
Canberra in ari attempt to improve
Australian - Indonesian relationships,
which have not been very good.
It was inevitable that the main issue
of difference between the two coun-
tries, the fate of West New Guinea,
now in the hands of the Dutch, should
be a matter for discussion, since with-
out discussion of it no friendly basis
of agreement could possibly be
contrived.
The Indonesian Government, some-
times violently, has demanded that the
Dutch should hand over this area, rich
in oil but otherwise primitive, though
evolving into civilisation under Dutch
development and educational schemes.
Indonesia has even threatened to use
force to take the colony.
The Dutch have resisted. The Aus-
tralian Government has inade it clear
all along that it would stand by the
Dutch in the event of any attempt to
take the area over without Nether-
lands consent.
Mr. Casey has stated the position
again and again—that New Guinea is
not in the Malayan zone but geo-
graphically on the Australian shelf and
in the Melanesian division of the
world.
He has told the Indonesians that
Australia does not recognise any claim
to any part of New Guinea on the
ground of geography or race. To do
so would be to admit a claim not only
to the Dutch possession but to Papua
and the Trust Territory of New Guinea.
The Government’s position in this
matter has not altered one iota.
At the same time, subject to any
decision of the International Court,
the Australian Government has con-
ceded that the Netherlands is the
sovereign occupier of Irian and that
under international law and the United
Nations Charter it has a right to dispose
of it.
If the Dutch were to offer rights over
it to Australia and the Commonwealth
were to accept' the offer it would
naturally defend its position, even
physically. But if the, Dutch are ready
to agree to hand it over to the Indo-
nesians it is a matter between the two
countries involved unless there is
opposition strong enough and willing
enough to resist within Irian itself.
A NYBODY within the United
Nations could, of course, bring the
matter before that strange body and
turn the issue into a world affair if the
U.N. Security Council felt that it came
within the scope of the Charter. But
Tor Australia to do it would perman-
ently ruin friendly relations with Indo-
nesia and throw it into the Communist
or Moslem-Nasser camp for good. And
the betting, in terms of the U.N.
Charter, is that, apart from the per-
manent enmity of the Indonesians, it
would achieve nothing.
The United Nations cannot just
seize a piece of territory under Dutch
or any other suzerainty and place it
under trust. Article 77 of the Charter
defines clearly how trust territories may
be created. They are limited to (a)
territories held under mandate under
the Versailles Treaty; (b) territories
detached from enemy States as the
result of World War II; (c) territories
voluntarily placed under the system by
States responsible for their administra-
tion. m
This leaves little hope that the U.N.
could interfere save by the desire of
the Dutch or some representative move-
ment by the people of Irian itself,
unless violence were resorted to and
international peace menaced.
All the Australian Government has
done is. to make the obvious clear.
Good relationships with Indonesia are
dependent, inter alia, on there being no
attempt at aggression against any part
of New Guinea and no action which
would imply a general racial and
geographical claim on the part of
Indonesia to New Guinea or part of it.
The opposition to the Common-
wealth attitude has come from several
quarters. First, the more talkative
sections of the R.S.L. have intervened.
They beat the Labor party, occupied
with its leadership tangle, to the draw
by a short head. The opposition of
Dr. Evatt, backed by a show of mock
indignation and a thin chorus of
approval from confused followers, was
inevitably followed by the “Sydney
Morning Herald.”
TABOR has acted as usual on the
assumption that whatever the
Menzies Government does must be
wrong, and that it is. in fact, incapable
of doing right even when it does what
the A.L.P. has previously declared to
be right and sternly demanded that it
do.
If the Government had demanded
that Australia should be consulted on
any agreement with 'the Dutch and
rattled its sabre, then it would have
been abused as warmongering and
interfering with the rights of two free
nations to settle their differences. If
it had roundly proclaimed that it would
allow no new Power to enter New
Guinea without its consent it would
have been imperialist.
Inconsistency never stopped Dr.
Evatt or Mr. Calwell or Mr. Ward
from lambasting an opponent. Some
of them thought New Guinea of so
little importance in the last war that
they even opposed the sending of
militia there for its defence.
All of them joined in the hunt to
drive out our allies, the friendly Dutch,
from Indonesia when the Japanese-
organised Indonesian rebels took after
them.
Subsequent events have made it
obvious that Labor’s attitude at that
time, as ever, was one of pure oppor-
tunism.
'T'HE Indonesian rebellion against the
A Dutch was a Javanese rebellion
primarily. No top-leader of real influ-
ence involved in it was not a Javan.
But other parts of the Indonesian
archipelago were far from enthusiastic
about the change from Dutch to Javan
colonialism, and there are islands such
as Sumatra, the Celebes, Eastern
Moluccas and particularly Ambon,
different racially and in which
are resistant to rule from Java and
only too eager, wholly or in part, to
break away from the central Govern-
ment.
Yet where has been the A.L.P.’s
support of these efforts at self-
determination, these resistances to the
colonialism of Djakarta? Dr. Evatt
and friends have been behind Djakarta
every time, presumably because Mos-
cow is behind the idea of a united
Indonesia irrespective of race or local
inclinations. If Indonesia made a
claim tomorrow the right to take over
the British possessions in Borneo the
A.L.P. would back it, as many of its
leading members did when that mea-
sure was advocated in 1945 and as it
did Nasser’s claims on Suez.
The Communist party, like the
Kremlin, would hate to see a solution
of the Irian problem that would settle
the matter. Their aim in Indonesia is
turmoil and disorder so that Commun-
ism may take over. They are all for
violence over Irian, coupled with bad-
neighbor relationships with Australia.


JOE CAHILL'S MISHIT PARADE


PLAIN ENGLISH
Macmillan's Hard Try
The visit to Moscow of Mr. Mac-
millan has most of the usual features,
with one or two novel ones inserted by
Mr. Macmillan.
The journey apparently was his
inspiration, and the Soviet Union Govern-
ment made the gesture of welcoming him
with open arms and a goose-stepping
guard.
The preliminaries to the mission’s
departure were not heartening. On
February 18, two or three days
before Macmillan left England, Khrush-
chev gave out a statement in which he
made it clear that on May 27 he intended
to hand-over East Berlin to the East
German Government, that the Allied
occupation of West Berlin would then
have to cease, that air-bridges to the
occupation-zones of the West would not
be tolerated. He referred to the sugges-
tion that the Western Allies would resort
to arms to keep their communications
with their zones open, and said that “only
people who do not take into account the
real facts can speak like this,” adding
grimly that Soviet troops were “not
stationed in the East German Republic
to play skittles”; that “attempts were
made to frighten us that, if we oppose
them, they will start shooting.” He
added: “It is clear to all that if anybody
started shooting that would mean the
beginning of war.”
“Some Powers,” he continued, “said
that even if the Soviet Union transferred
its rights in Berlin to East Germany, the
Western Powers would not recognise the
treaty,” but he held that the transfer
would be recognised by international law,
and resistance to it would “bring great
sacrifices and destruction literally in all
countries.”
This, of course, is nonsense, for the
occupation was based on a treaty by
specific/'Powers and can only be abrogated
or altered by consent of those Powers.
In the unpromising atmosphere created
by this grim and threatening statement
Mr. Macmillan winged his way to
Moscow and found Mr. Khrushchev
and his goose-stepping guard on the aero-
drome, full of cheers and good-
fellowship.
Macmillan is making a gallant attempt
by going to Moscow “to establish some
basis of confidence or treaty,” or in some
other way remove the danger of starting
a war “by miscalculation or muddle.”
But the fact remains that the danger
of war does not depend on miscalcula-
tion or muddle ; it rests on the existence
of the cold policy of world-revolution
which is the very basis of the Soviet
Union’s system “peace through
Marxism-Leninism,” by the destruction,
by force of arms if necessary, of every-
thing in the world that is opposed to
the establishment of Communism.
Almost at the moment when the
junketing was going on in Moscow news
of the relentless progress of Com-
munist China’s plan for the conquest of
Asia came out of Peking. This scheme
of Mao’s was first unearthed and pub-
lished in 1953 and has received neither
confirmation nor denial from the
Chihese. But its stages have come about
almost inexorably. The final one was
to be the enlistment of 25-million men
round about 1960 for the subjugation
of S.-E. Asia. Last week’s announce-
ment from Peking mentioned an imme-
diate plan to enrol 30-million Chinese
militiamen for some unspecified purpose.
Blit its significance when linked with the
Berlin affair is serious.
The most dangerous feature of the
present atmosphere is the tendency to
take Soviet leaders at their face-value
when they are being smooth. The only
safe guarantee of peace with them would
be their renunciation of the international
objectives of Communism and a definite
reduction of their military forces to the
level of local defence in agreement with
Western Powers.
If Macmillan can bring back tangible
proof that the emphasis is changing, that
the Eastern European “nations” now
held down by Soviet tanks can become
free to decide their own destinies and
their people to mingle with the rest of
the world, he will have achieved a miracle.
He will have done well if he can even
make the first step towards breaking
the ice.
Parliament Opens
From the Governor-General’s speech at
the opening of the Federal Parliament
it seemed as if the Government had
taken a resolution to do during this
Parliament most of the things that it
and some of its predecessors have left
undone and ought to have done.
The general trend is towards a tighter
grip by the national Government on a
lot of activities which have been hitherto
left for regional handling by the States,
with resulting confusion and annoyance
and expense to everybody.
One of the first measures on its list
is a uniform divorce law which is as
badly needed as a uniform defamation
law —about which it has done nothing.
The bill will be a liberalisation of the
contentious Joske Bill.
Other plans are reform of the public
service, investigation by a competent and
independent tribunal of the income-tax
laws also long overdue, but scarcely
possible of achievement save with a new
Treasurer in office.
It is intended to bring the copyright
and bankruptcy laws up to date.
Defence - planning involves nothing
new. The period is evolutionary, and the
Australian defence system is involved,
like those of the rest of the world, in
the change-over from the prototype to
the practical in the missile and missile-
carrier fields, but there is a disapjpointing
lack of emphasis in the Government pro-
grammes, as set out in the speech, of plans
for training troops for routine service
and the population at large for civilian
defence in the atom age.
Much of the rest of the pro-
gramme seems to bear the finger-
prints of Mr. McEwen. The emphasis
is on the proposal to expand the
Colombo Plan, work for closer friendly
relationships with nearer Asiatic coun-
tries, and at the same time arrange trade-
agreements which are highly advan-
tageous from our point of view because
the lower standards of living of Asiatic
countries give them an entirely different
outlook to our own on balanced exchange
transactions.
_ Internal development wilt include pro-
grammes for allocation of money from
Revenue Account for State roads, con-
tinuation of the search for oil and for
alternative uses .for coal to employ miners
who have been put out of work by
mechanisation of mines, though these
are not so numerous as propaganda
would make them appear.
These are matters which will be dealt
with as their turn arrives, but priority
is being given to the reconsideration of
the banking bills defeated during the
last Parliament. They are to be got off
the sheet before anything new of real
importance is handled. Passing them
early will be a matter of tactics with
the Government, since it will get out
of the way the main matters of contention
with its own back bench.
It might have been expected that the
Opposition would have had at least some
word of praise for the constructive and
comprehensive nature of the Government
programme, but its policy is that every-
thing the Government does must be bad
and opposed to the last gasp. It is be-
cause it is this kind of Opposition that
it is in its present parlous state.
N. S. Wales Elections
Nominations for the N.S.W. election
to be held on March 21 closed on Friday,
only four days after Premier Cahill had
named the day for his rendezvous with
the people. There are 239 candidates,
compared with 232 in 1956. The Labor
party is contesting 79 of the 94 seats ;
there will be 68 Liberal candidates, 23
Country-party, 25 Democratic Labor-
party, 21 Communists and 23 Inde-
pendents.
Eleven members have been returned
unopposed. Of these, E. Wetherel!
(Cobar) is the only Labor man. The
five Liberals elected unopposed are Ivan
Black (Neutral Bay), G. W. Brain
(Willoughby), G. S. Cox (Vaucluse),
D. S. Fraser (Gordon), and V. H. Treatt
(Woollahra). Five Country-party mem-
bers unopposed are W. A. Chaffey (Tam-
worth), S. D. Dickson (Temora), L. L.
Robinson (Casino), S. T. Stephens
(Byron) and W. R. Weiley (Clarence).
In addition to these 10 seats Labor is
conceding another five to the Opposition ;
in Mosman Opposition-leader Pat Mor-
ton is opposed only by Communist W. A.
Wood, and in Gloucester, Lismore,
Oxley and South Coast the sitting Oppo-
sition members have only Independents
against them.
Although the Opposition has nomi-
nated 91 candidates, it will be contesting
only 87 seats. In Ashfield-Croydon two
Liberal candidates have been endorsed
—D. B. Hunter and R. W. Murden who
represented the two electorates which
were merged to form this new seat. In


Dubbo, Mudgee and Young there will
be both Liberal and Country-party can-
didates against the sitting Labor members.
The D.L.P. has also nominated candi-
dates for these three seats.
There will be no Liberal or Country-
party candidates for Cessnock, Hartley,
Illawarra, Kurri Kurri, Lake Macquarie
or Waratah ; in these coalfields seats
Labor will be opposed by Independents
and Communists. Waratah is held by
Independent F. O. Purdue ; the others are
Labor seats.
In addition to the three country elec-
torates mentioned the most interesting
D.L.P. nominations are for Concord,
North Sydney, Rockdale and Ryde—all
won by Labor by very small majorities
last election ; Bondi (Housing Minister
Landa’s seat) and Wagga (held by Trans-
port Minister Enticknap).
The rumored Clive Evatt party has
not made an official appearance but it
is probable that some of the Independents
may team-up with the rebel.
Damp Squib and Aftermath
If any citizen was on his bended knees
on the day the Federal caucus met to
elect a leader it would have been Mr.
Cahill praying hard that Dr. Evatt would
be defeated ; but Mr. Ward’s bombshell
proved a damp squib.
And now, Dr. Evatt having been
elected, Mr. Cahill must go to the poll
with him as a burden, for the Com-
munist leaders of the great A.L.P. financ-
ing unions have taken the game into
their own hands.
Dr. Evatt looks to have had an easy
win. The pathetic plea of the politically
expiring Senator Grant for fairplay and
a secret ballot, so that no pressure or
intimidation might be used against the
flustered voters, failed. The leader him-
self preserved a stately silence. The vote
was taken, and Evatt beat Ward by 45
votes to 32. It was not, however, a very
flattering victory to one who had been
in the saddle for so many years and was
so much extolled for his genius and
statesmanship by party organs.
Seven out of eight of new members
of the caucus voted for the wilting idol,
and thus the vote for and against him
among those who has experienced his
Parliamentary leadership was only about
50-50.
Now, apart from bearing the Federal
Opposition’s cross, Mr. Cahill must bear
the Doctor, too. He has done everything
possible to mitigate the handicap to
which is added an extra penalty in the
shape of the demand by the Communist
party that he should be its members’
first choice where there is no Communist
candidate. Equal pay for men and
women, new foundation-stones for
power-houses, more and better alimony
and some for husbands, extra holidays
for police, and small vote-buying stunts
for a host of other interests on the eve of
the poll are among his expedients. And
he has done all he can to build hazards
for his foes —the delay in announcing
the date of the poll until it was too late
for new voters to enrol; the fixing of
the date during the Sydney Royal Show,
when thousands of country voters could
be expected to be away from their elec-
torates and when the life of the com-
munity would be disrupted by the Easter
holidays. These are one or two of his
devices.
However, they seem unlikely to
succeed. His declaration of love and
affection for Dr. Evatt finished him with
the D.L.P., which is grimly advocating
that its preferences go to the Liberals.
Lack of money will make his campaign-
ing far from easy. Dissension within
the party—in the Illawarra, in Rockdale
and elsewhere —is rife.
The Liberals expect a majority of six
for the joint Opposition parties. If they
cannot get it against such an outfit,
shabby from its shoelaces upwards and
its political reputation blown upon every
day, they should disband.
Billy Graham
[From “Collins Street"]
Billy Graham and his chief helper at
his gatherings, Clifford Barrows, make
the point at some period of their ora-
tions that their crusade, with the atten-
tion it receives in the newspapers and
on radio and TV, must bring more people
to the churches; and granted that
Christianity is an influence for good in
the community, it is apparent that the
crusade, whatever reservations an indi-
vidual may have about evangelists, will
be beneficial.
Graham and Barrows make this point
not defensively in answer to any un-
spoken criticism but simply as a fact
to be remembered by the converted and
unconverted alike. It is reasonable, and,
to the open-minded, convincing. There-
fore Billy Graham is likely to be a good
influence in Australia.
I turned back from the great crowds
and lanes of cars that converged on
Melbourne Stadium for the opening-meet-
ing of his Australian crusade ; the next
meeting was not quite so inaccessible, and
I got a seat Exclusively for the Working
Press with three genuine pressmen and
others who sang hymns too heartily from
the special crusade songbook to be press-
men or presswomen.
Clifford Barrows was leading a hymn
as I walked in, and from that moment
everything went-off like clockwork, as
it does, not to be irreverent of the pur-
pose of the gathering, in a stage musical
production. Barrows, not overly in-
gratiating, was on the floral-bedecked
dais, and behind him were the Melbourne
clerical and lay protagonists of the
crusade, with special guests ; and behind
them the choir.
Every seat was filled. The Stadium
holds 7500 ; there were clusters around
every one of the score or so doors, and
2000 were accommodated in an annexe
watching on closed-circuit TV, so that
not many fewer than 10,000 were there.
They were predominantly young, and
young people listening to a call to closer
ties with the church disarm a critic
immediately. (The audience increased
on following nights.)
The production of the first part of
the meeting which leads up to the second
half, exclusively monopolised by Dr.
Graham, is just on perfect. The hymns
are confined to two verses, the speakers
to perhaps 100 words, the choir (of
nearly 500) to a few minutes, and the
songs of the bass-baritone, George
Beverly Shea, whose records are popular,
are also brief, and rhythmic, too, and
altogether pleasing to a musical ear.
The expertness of it all, and the split-
second timing, may raise a little doubt
if you are used to the occasional late-
ness or fumbling, or the boredom which
your local parson or priest, whom you
nevertheless respect very much, engenders
in you ; but the fast movement of the
production carries you on without much
time for these reflections up to the
arrival at the microphone of Billy
Graham himself.
Graham, without being a spellbinder,
holds your undivided attention. He is
perhaps a little too handsome, with a
full head of hair at 40, and his voice,
amplified from a tiny microphone con-
cealed in his tie and sleeve, magnificent.
He looks like what used to be called a
matinee idol, and he gives a performance
that might strike you as rehearsed, and
is certainly practised, but not matter how
coldly you may regard it, it is impressive.
Not one of his gestures or inflections
of his voice suggest that he is anything
but deeply sincere as he strides about
the dais, taking as his text the Bible
story of the adulteress, the Pharisees and
Jesus, berating every one of the listeners
for breaking every one of the Command-
ments, and finally asking, beneath the
fierce, white lights, for Christians pre-
pared to dedicate themselves to come and
stand forward.
About 300 did so to muted organ
music. They came from all parts of the
Stadium in the hush while the evangelist
in various thoughtful poses on the dais,
occasionally but very briefly told those
“still struggling with their hearts” that
he would wait. It was a much happier
spectacle than the faith-healing to which
Melbourne was subjected a few years ago.
As they went off, Graham retired
from the dais, a minister stepped forward
to lead benediction, and Graham slipped
off quietly, not waiting for it, and put
on a raincoat, presumably to address
those in the annexe.
There was, of course, a collection
before Graham spoke. (He was to be
heard, he said, on 1000 U.S. radio-
stations and on TV from Toronto to
Miami and from New York to Cali-
fornia.) The Melbourne treasurer said
that when the Graham organisation was
first approached to conduct a ministry
in Australia, the reply was a generous
offer to come and pay all expenses.
“That put us on our mettle,” he said,
“and we felt the necessity for raising
£56,000 to pay the costs.”
The ambiguity about Graham’s costs
is understandable. The financing of a
crusade on such a scale as this must be
expensive, and high costs, by Australian
standards, are likely to be misinterpreted,
or at least misunderstood. Only clerics
and their lay colleagues and advisers seem
to understand that clergy must eat, too.

that, with my ability to strip a pound

in ad libbing and gags while following

hard way—going around horse after
horse, at one stage five horses out from

there was the thrilling finish in which the

was continued until I got out, seven

“Carpentarian”: “Duke” Tritton’s

the interests of historical accuracy I must
mention that Feetham was not afterwards
Bishop of Carpentaria—he was appointed
Bishop of North Queensland, the big
Anglican diocese bordering Carpentaria
on its northern side. Gilbert White,
another long-legged cleric who did his
travelling round his huge diocese of land
and sea in all sorts of unconventional
ways, was Carpentaria’s first bishop, and
was followed by Henry Newton, ex-New
“Yoo-hoo, Captain!”


Guinea missionary, who gave place ia
turn to Bishop Stephen Davies. Feetham
was known all over the north, and there
are yarns by the score concerning him.
He used to wear a straw “tiger-chaser”
as head-covering, and in a loose coat and
baggy trousers, humping a canvas bag
across his shoulders, might have been
mistaken for a sundowner. On one occa-
sion, while on episcopal visitation, he
overslept in a railway carriage. As the
train was moving out startled spectator's
on the platform saw a couple of bags
flying through the carriage-windows, the
Bishop himself excitedly waving to stop
the train. English-born, he was always
eager to return to his diocese after visits
to the Old Country; some of his fellow-
bishops used to tell of his stalking along
London’s streets on a cold day, after
a Lambeth gathering, assuring them
loudly that he’d be “glad to get back
to a white-man’s country!”

“Nicotiana”: My Brisbane daily ran four
lines, headed “Smoker’s Death,” on the pass-
ing, in England, of Alfred Dunhill, who made
the pipes, but didn’t smoke them. Dunhill,
born in 1872, had already founded and severed
his connection with the firm of Dunhill’s
Motorities when, round about 1914, he set-up
as a tobacconist in Duke Street, St. James
(London). There were well-known tobacconists,
and well-known pipes on sale, in London long
before Dunhill came on the scene, but it was
Alfred Dunhill who raised the whole business
of pipe-smoking to the level of a fine art, for
the Dunhill pipe, made of specially selected
bruyere root, needed an assortment of gadgetry
(combustible fuel for bowl-cleansing, paste for
bowl-polishing, etc.) so that its name, and price
(£1 Is. to £5 in those days), might be lived-up to.
There was also a special “tailor-made” mixture
(blended to suit the customer’s palate) to go
“Still, you must admit that being so terrifically rich enables you to enjoy
SOME of the good things of life”
into it, and, because a Dunhill pipe must not
be carelessly filled, Dunhill tobacco was on
sale in miniature cartons (to fill the bowl)-
with a sort of zip-tastener to release the papei
wrapper when the bowl was charged. Later,
in 1922, Dunhill put the first pocket-lighter on
the market, and that model is still being used.
Alfred Dunhill was a first-class publicity-man
and made a fortune out of his connection with
tobacco: he himself would have laughed loudest

six-o’clock in the evening into the town
and at eight-o’clock in the morning out
of it. So to attend the bi-weekly picture-
screenings they would catch the evening
bus into the township, see the show, then
book into the hotel for the night, return-
ing the mile by bus next morning to their
flat. Asked wouldn’t it be cheaper to
engage a taxi for the two trips necessary,
they explained they had been told a bus
passed the door and were firm believers
in using public transport because it was
a lot cheaper than taxis.

“For the first time, all parties in N.S.W. will

From a soap-box once they’d spout

With the dope they handed out.
Then, should ever-moving trap
In a most forbidding map
Become a quite insufferable trial,
If with sense you were endowed
You’d move well back in the crowd
Till mercifully blurred became his dial.
Came the radio, and we found
That the politicians seized
Upon this as fruitful ground.
So they coughed and whined and
wheezed,
Hummed and hawed and backed and filled
As their woody thoughts they spilled
Before appeal to “work for them”
they’d end with.
Still, that wasn’t quite so bad,
For at least we only had
Some disembodied voices to contend
with.
Now we’ll cop impassioned appeals
On TV! Our peace departs!
Futile all the viewers’ squeals
As this horror-era starts.
Close-up cameras, do your worst!
All my twenty-three valves, burst!
Yet I feel that though they’re on their
best behavior,
Many eager to be seen
Upon the TV-screen
May find it more destroyer than a
savior!

"Hey, Mate, Len's Yer Lipstick..."
O For That He-man Odor!
By MARCUS O'HEARN
Friends, Romeos and countrymen —•
we are, it seems, about to be brain-
washed again by the Great Pan-
jandra of Gadgetry. The wheels
of a brand-new industry are slowly
beginning to revolve. Meanwhile, we are
to be softened-up with some very subtle
press-propaganda —in preparation for
another big squeeze ...
1 am old enough to remember a time
when women, by and large, did not,
apparently, use cosmetics. In those, days
the majority of women had a bath every
now and then, and were content to let
it go at that. It was reserved for the
ladies of Leicester Square (London) to
display their particular trade - mark in
the fact that they did, obviously, use-
make-up ; and, if you encountered one
of them off her beaten track, then, from
the very fact that she was painted, hair-
doed, animatedly busted, and bejewelled,
you knew her for exactly what she was.
Had anyone thought of the idea of a
wolf-whistle in those days, 1 suppose these
ladies would have sounded it on the re-
verse note, but, as things were, they
had to be content with the bestowal of
a “glad-eye” and a genteel intonation of
the words, “Hello, dearie . . .”
Maybe, in the upper reaches of the
social ionosphere in those days, a very
daring duchess or countess used to
cosmetise on the sly, but if it were done,
then it was done very judiciously. Even
well-known stage personalities had to
show to the world (of daylight, at any
rate) their own natural faces. Some way
or other the ladies did not seem to need
then the boosting - power that cosmetics
are now alleged to confer upon feminine
■morale. If their morale was about to
collapse, the ladies of my youth needed
neither lipstick nor rouge. They just
maintained a stiff upper-lip, and with a
few vigorous sniffs from a bottle of
smelling - salts their attack of the
"vapors” was repulsed.
It was much the same with smoking.
In those days we had smoking-rooms
(Gentlemen Only), smoking - jackets
(ditto), and even smoking-caps (ditto),
but no smoking ladies. Occasionally,
perhaps, one might come upon an
advanced type toying with an Abdulla in
some secluded corner —after dinner. But
they were all one-cigarette ladies, who
would not have made chicken-feed for
any tobacconist.
It was the same with drinking.
Working-class women used to go into
the local for a noggin, but, no more than
mixed-bathing, there was no mixed-
drinking. Ladies, of course, did not
drink beer then. They might toy with
a little wine at dinner, or, if they were
severely affected by the “vapors,” they

press.
might gargle with a nip of brandy.
Beyond that they just did not go—or, if
they did go, they went to bed, and had
it brought to their bedside.
T\7ell, I have lived through all that, to
* see grandmotherly types, in full war-
paint, breathing out smoke and beer-
fumes in the lounges of first-class hotels.
Their grandchildren are at it, too. They
(the grandchildren) have not only thrown :
off all parental restraint, but, like their
mothers and grandmothers, have thrown-
off most of their clothing also. They not
only paint their faces but they paint
their fingernails and toenails as well.
And now, having thoroughly cosmetised
the ladies, young and old, as far as the
capacity of their chassis will permit, the
glamorfacturers turn their mind-condi-
tioning tactics on to us !
The decree has gone out. Advertising-
campaigns and new “packaging notions”
have been geared-up. Both fathers and
sons (and grandfathers) are about to be
submerged in a new flood —of -men’s
“toiletries”"!
“A pleasing jump in men’s cosmetics”
is noted by the trade, and passed on to
an obedient Sunday newspaper. Then,
just in case we might be thinking that all
this seems strangely unlike cricket, and
hardly a necessary-, accompaniment to
“The Roast Beef of" Old England,” we
are told (by the Sunday paper) that Prince
Philip's hairdresser does not like the idea
of women buying their men’s cosmetics.’
The men should buy their own!
In that way, I* presume, they (the men)
will gradually be able to neutralise their
blushes when asking for under - arm
razors, deodorants, and eau-de-Cologne !
Any day now we may expect a wharfies’
stop-work meeting, or a shearers’ strike,
to settle the question as to how they are
to adjust their present wage-schedule to
the High Cost of Cosmetics!
T>ut —we, who are about to be de-
" odorised, do not salute the glamor-
facturers! Might 1 appeal to the wool-
growers of this country to rally round
our standard and step in for some of
the dough before it all goes to the
cosmeticians?
In days gone by, I well remember, on
the moors (the moors in Scotland, I
mean) how pleasantly Harris-tweed-used

POLITICAL POINTS
State elections will be held in N.S.W.
and 'Westralia on March 21 ; in South
Australia on March 7.
• •
On Friday night the D.L.P. officially
announced that it would not give its
second preferences to the A.L.P. except
where the alternative would be to give
them to Communists. Otherwise the
A.L.P. will be placed at the bottom of
the card.
An official statement spoke of “the
mistaken view held by some that the
Cahill Government represents a moderate
force in the Evatt party.” It condemned
Left-wing Socialism and said:
“Should Mr. Cahill be returned to power,
N.S.W. would face a situation where its
State Government would be the prisoner of
Left-wing and Communist policies and
pressures.”
The D.L.P. has nominated 25 candi-
dates, including J. T. Kane, its general-
secretary, who will lead the party in the
election-campaign, with D. Drinkwater,
candidate for the Maitland seat, as
deputy-leader.
• •
Prime Minister Macmillan is obviously
the type who believes in putting a thing
you don’t need safely away “because you
never know when it’ll come in handy.”
Thirty years ago he bought a white fur-
hat to wear on a visit to Russia. Last
week he took it out of mothballs and
wore it on a second visit —and it Was
acclaimed the hat of the year.
• •
Cahill’s policy - speech was scheduled
for last night (February 24) at Mascot;
Morton will deliver his at Mosman on
Tuesday, March 3, and will be on the
Country-party platform at Armidale the
following night when Davis Hughes fires
his first shots.
• •
When Senator Spooner proposed that
three Government and three A.L.P.
Senators should be appointed to the
Parliamentary Library Committee, Senator
Cole (D.L.P.) objected, nominated his
colleague, Senator McManus, and asked
for a secret ballot. A.L.P. leader
Senator McKenna objected to a secret
. ballot, claiming that the Senate rules
made no provision for it, but the presi-
dent, Senator McMullin, overruled him.
When the counting was finished
McManus filled the sixth place on the
committee, ousting the third A.L.P.
candidate. Nothing Remarkable about
that —except that the voting showed that
at least three A.L.P. Senators must have
voted for the D.L.P. man. But which
three?
N.S.W. Labor senators who favored
the official ticket probably made wistful
comparisons with the voting-systems used
in ballots for the N.S.W. Legislative
Council. These are also secret ballots,
but the boys who conduct them seem'
to be able to pierce the veil—as some
A.L.P. members who bucked the ticket
a few years ago discovered to their dis-
advantage.
• •
Labor’s gesture in giving the D.L.P.
its second preferences in the N.S.W.
election is no more than a gesture. It is
most unlikely that the A.L.P. prefs. will
be distributed before the D.L.P. in any
electorate.
• •
If the Cyprus agreement is to have
any lasting value it will have to be
observed in a spirit of co-operation that
has been completely Jacking in the island
for many years. That such a change
can be brought about overnight seems
almost too much to expect. Still, a fort-
night ago the chances of the Greek and
Turkish Governments agreeing to terms
for a settlement seemed as remote as
next century. Yet within a few days they
had not only reached agreement, but had
persuaded the British Government and
the leaders of the two national factions
in Cyprus to accept it.
Haylen, M.H.R., on titles in the Com-
monwealth Public Service: I have before
me a note from my- secretary of things
I have to do this week.' Let's have a look
at it. It is in this strain:
Ring Sir Patrick about your taxation
worries. Ascertain whether you can see
Sir William about that superannuation job.
Sir Kenneth may be able to help you on
a legal opinion about Mrs.” Murgatroyd.
Sir John has promised you a trade permit.
You should look him up. If Sir Giles is
still with us, see whether you can get a
telephone for the Diggers at Burwood. Sir
Walter may help you with that Digger’s
pension. If all else fails, you ean ring
Sir Roland at the Treasury, to see whether
something can be accomplished by this
means.
Later Arthur Cal well followed-up
Haylen’s remarks by proposing that Aus-
tralian citizens should no longer be
recommended for British honors. Instead,
he advocated Australian decorations,
such as the Order of the Wattle. There’d
be something rather appropriate about
Cal well, O.W.

“Ex-ACT”: Canberra’s Chamber of
Commerce is urging that “more national
conferences” should be held in Canberra,
the national capital. Trouble is it’s hard
enough to get members of the Rational
Parliament to stay there more than a
few weeks.
OUTRAGEOUS!
"Capability over seniority? Talent from outside the service? Higher
educational standards? They might as well give the country back to
the people!”


Ward’s score in the Leadership Stakes
•—32 to the Doc.’s 46 —was. the highest
ever made against Evatt, but it wasn’t
so much indicative of faith in Eddie as
of a growing lack of faith in Bert. When
Westralian T. P. Burke made a bid for
the leadership in 1954 he polled only 24
votes. A year later, after the Hobart
conference, when Evatt resigned and re-
nominated to test the confidence of the
party, Burke and Calwell were both
nominated. Burke got only five votes
and Calwell 22. The Doc scored 52.
Allan Fraser made his challenge after
the 1955 election and was beaten 58-20.

Cagey to the last minute; Cahill in
announcing his election-date (March 21)
provided for the issue of the writs at
once so that the rolls closed only a few
hours after his announcement. Still, there
wasn’t much point in the Opposition’s
complaint that this disfranchised thou-
sands of voters who were not given time
to become enrolled. In the previous two
months scarcely a day had passed with-
out speculation on the date of the elec-
tion ; the actual date chosen had been
a hot tip for a couple of weeks. Most
of those who missed-out have only them-
selves to blame.
• •
To a lesser degree the same thing
applies to nomination-day (February 20),
although four days is rather shorter
notice than is usually given. The poli-
tical parties had their lists of candidates
drawn-up ready and anyone contemplat-
ing standing as -an Independent must have
come pretty close to making his mind
up by the time Cahill made his announce-
ment. Joe certainly didn’t leave anyone
much time for thinking after he named
the day. But he gave ’em plenty before
that.

A newly-invented British device
generates ultrasonic vibrations in the
hull-plating of ships and not only deters
barnacles from attaching themselves to

In Sydney some doubts are being cast
on the legality of State funds being used
for the Opera House, but in Melbourne
the Liberal-Country Party Council pro-
poses to ask the Bolte Government to
consider holding State lotteries to permit

and cultural centre just over Princes
Bridge on the former Wirth’s Circus site.
The move illustrates the force of a bad
example.

on March 7. R. H. Curren, who was
A.L.P. candidate in 1956, wifi -also be

votes will be fairly evenly distributed
among the three men, with Curren’s
preferences deciding the issue.

The Commonwealth Government is
going to make an all-out bid for a wide
exchange of scientific
information with Japan. R. G. Casey will
make the initial overtures when he visits
Nippon in March-April this year. He.
is taking with him the principal research-
officer of the C.5.1.R.0., G. Gresford.
While in Japan, Casey will have talks
with the Japanese Government on matters
of common concern to both countries,
as the most highly industrialised areas in
the western Pacific. Canberra feels that
both countries can learn a lot from each
other, and also that they could join in
combined scientific efforts to place tech-
niques and methods at the disposal of
other countries less industrialised.

F. W, C. Rieck, who never lets an
election go by without being in it. is
one of a field of five contesting the
S.A. Assembly seat of Burnside. He's
standing as an Independent Liberal. In
1956 he stood against H. H. Shannon
(L.C.L.) in Onkaparinga and in 1953
against J. S. Clark (A.L.P.) in Gawler.
In between those two campaigns he took
a stab-at the Federal seat of Angas and
in November last tried his luck in Grey.
Other Federal seats he has tackled are
Wakefield (1946) and Barker (1951). In
1949, by way of a change, he stood for
the Senate.

According to Dr. Robert Southby,
chairman of the B.M.A.’s road-accidents
committee, accidents cost Victoria £17.5
million a year, made-up as follows:
500 road deaths a year, £5 million (based
on the Immigration Department’s esti-
mate of a migrant being worth £10,000);
£4 million for third-party claims ; £8
million for comprehensive - insurance
claims and £500,000 for patients in

The N.S.W. executive of the Labor
party has prepared a booklet, “Eighteen
Years of Labor Rule,” which, according

“Ex-ACT”: Federal Ministers Casey

ference to deal especially with problems

rubber, tin, cotton and sugan
Commonwealth Statistician Carver’s
figures of wool exports for July/Decem-
ber are gloomy reading. Although ex-
ports of greasy wool declined by only
about nine-millionjb. in weight, compared
with the same six months of the previous
year, the cheque for them dropped by
£6O million, which means that the wool-
cheque for the whole financial year may
be at least £lOO million down.

“Ardoyne”: Nothwithstanding the
high-pressure sales-talk designed to make
a family Without TV feel a back-number,
the inclusion of TV as an itern of the
c.-0.-l. index is unlikely for a while
yet. A Victorian* Supreme Court judge,
in assessing the share of a widow in the
estate bequeathed by her late husband,
from whom she had been estranged, to
a cousin, rejected a request for a sum
to buy a TV-set on the ground that he
could make provision only for the
claimant’s needs, and a TV-set was not,
in his view, a necessity.

Myer’s haven’t any misgivings about
the future. The giant Melbourne re-
tailer’s new drive-in shopping centre at
Gladstone, 10 miles from Princes Bridge,
will be a shopping city in itself, with
81 shops in a landscape setting, free
parking-space for 2500 cars, playgrounds
of all sorts, two shopping Malls, with
plenty of letting-space for competitors.
The aim of it all is One Stop and Shop.
It will cost Myer’s £3 million to build
and £3 million to stock. Work on the
project begins this week.

A.L.P. preferences in South Australia
are being allocated “for the convenience
of electors,” not for the advantage of
other, parties. This means in practice that
Labor voters will be advised to vote
down or up the card according to whether
the A.L.P. man is at the bottom or the
top of the ballot-paper. It also means
that in most cases the prefs. will go to
the L.C.L. and not the D.L.P.

A chain - store and an independent
grocer have been conducting a price-
cutting campaign at Clayton, an outer
Melbourne suburb, and the independent
fellow has been selling butter at 2s. sd.
(normally 4s. 94d.), sausages at Is. 6d.
(25.), eggs at ss. lid. (6s. 4d.) and so on.
Housewives have been wondering how
long the independent fellow will stay the
distance ; but he says he’s still making a
profit on all lines, except butter, and as
his turnover has increased so much,
everything’s fine.

“Uramao”: When the original All

Wallace was a member and C. F. Stanger-
Leathes played for Northumberland.
Recently the Englishman, visiting N.Z.,
met Billy Wallace, and the two relived
campaigns on the fields of England
over half-a-century ago, when Northum-
berland and the Enzedders met. Wallace
revealed a piece of Rugby history con-
cerning the name “All Blacks.” He said
it originated through a typographical
error. When they beat an English team
by 63-0 the local paper’s reporter in-
tended referring to the Enzedders as “all
backs,” because of their all-round
speed. The printer made it “All Blacks,”
and a later match in Somerset drew a

He thinks there are tremendous oppor-

people, since it is better to have an
economic situation that might have to
be modified than no economic situation

“K.R.”: If anyone deserved to beat
Clarrie Grimmett’s long-standing record
of the greatest number of Test-wickets by
an Australian bowler, it was Ray Lind-
wall. Few fast-bowlers have remained
at the top as long as he has. A good
fieldsman and capable bat, too, Lindwall
hit the fastest post-war Test-century be-
tween England and Australia (100, in
Melbourne, in 1946-47). A story which
shows his cricketing quality concerns a
second-class match during the tour to
the West Indies in 1955. The locals had
made 265 and had Australia 6-60, when
Lindwall, with a painful carbuncle on
his right hand, went in to join Johnson.
“Are you going to give it away?” asked
Johnson, as the game was unimportant
and as the first ball Lindwall received
obviously hurt him. “What?” said Lind-
wall. “We can’t let this crowd beat us.


I’m not getting out.” And neither he did,
till he’d made 68 and helped to save the
side. Johnson rated Lindwall one of the
finest team-men he ever played with. A
former star Rugby League footballer,
Lindwall- is a liaison-officer with the

the new Federal Treasurer, hurrying
along Portsea (Vic.) beach the other day.

caught. Evidently he had been out
in a boat on the Rip, which stretches

Alec Chisholm pays tribute to a fellow-
naturalist :
Charles Barrett, passed-on in Melbourne at
79, was about the last of the various naturalists
who began to publicise Australia’s fauna and
flora in the early part of this century. He was
the most prolific of them all, as far as book-
production was concerned, for almost 50 years.
A good all-rounder in natural-history, he
wasn't an authority on any particular aspect,
and sometimes would express envy of those
who were disposed to concentrate. But at other
times-—perhaps, when I would ask: “What’s
your branch of study this month, Charlie?” —
his brown : eyes would twinkle and he would
proclaim, gently but firmly, that the all-round
naturalist was the really useful fellow.
Practically all his life was devoted to natural-
history and kindred subjects. Joining the Mel-
bourne “Herald” as a young man, he soon
found workaday reporting beyond him, but
pulled his weight in other directions, including
the editing of a boys’ paper, “Pals,” for many
years. Later he gave lengthy service as honorary
editor of the “Victorian Naturalist.”
For all his unworldliness, Charlie joined-up
in T9t6 (Field Ambulance) and afterwards
edited a troops' journal, between whiles keep-
ing an eye on the wildlife of the Palestine
desert. Once he waxed unusually
aggressive—as he revealed later in a book—
when a stone was tossed at a desert-wagtail.
He “threatened to punch a burly sergeant-
major’s head to putty.” The disclosure quite
rocked the lads at the “Herald.”

If fewer laws mean better government
Victoria should soon be on the way to a
remarkably enlightened condition. Con-
solidation of the State’s statutes, now
nearly finished, will reduce the number
of Acts in the book from 2500 to 233.
It should then be much easier for
lawyers and laymen to find their way
about Parliament’s cumulative enact-
ments.
The legal eagle in charge is Robert
Casley Normand, who became Director
of the Consolidation of Statutes in 1955,
after he had been Parliamentary
Draughtsman for 10 years. Normand
joined the A.I.F. in 1915 as an 18-year-
old, won the Military Medal in 1917,
and was commissioned in 1918. He
practised as a. barrister before becoming
a Parliamentary officer. Knowing the
working as well as the making of the
laws has helped him in what seems to
be a remarkable swift job of tying-up
their loose ends.

ABORIGINALITIES
TU'Rom Laverton, in the dry country
n.-n.-e. of Kalgoorlie, comes a report
of a mass-migration of kangaroos, an
estimated 2000 hopping through in one
day. That’s what one man saw ; there
could have been a, hundred times as
many, because, although that country for
hundreds of miles eastward would pass
for desert in most parts of the world,
it holds patches of good pastoral country
well stocked with ’roos and dingoes.
There could be horses and donks.; too.
Forty years ago, as a kid on holidays,
I saw mobs of brumbies shot on a station
between Laverton and the Warburton
Ranges. They’d become so numerous,
following a couple of good seasons, that
they were a serious pest, outnumbering
the ’roos. But there have been some jong
droughts out that way since then, and I
think the ’roo would weather them better
than, the horse. —“Bass.”

“Flight”: One of the marvels of W.Q.
is the coming of the waterhens with the
“Do you fill it up or trigger it?”
wet season bantam-size chooks with
black feathers, red legs, twitching tails,
and energy in every movement. There
won’t be a hen for 10,000 square-miles ;
but as soon as the first rain starts drum-
ming down there’s a mighty aerial express
cleaving through the night with a rustling
of wind and an occasional cry; and
soon black dots are dancing oyer the land
and romping through the lignum in
thousands. Where do they come from?
And how do they all know at once that
Hughie is sending it down somewhere
hundreds of miles away?
“Cygnet”: Fishermen working Tas-
mania’s east coast blame the whaling-
industry for the falling-off in barracuda-
catches. Reduction of the whale-herds
has meant a big increase in quantity of
plankton on which the big fellows
feed. With such extra feed available
the ’cuda turn their noses up at the
tempting fishermen’s bait. Another case
of the balance of nature being upset.

“P.0.M.C.”: Baldy, the P.M.G. lines-
man,' had been pretty seedy all day, and,
after closing the manhole with his mate,
collapsed on the pavement. His mate
rang the depot, and Baldy was rushed
home in a staff-car. Next day, pay-day,
Baldy was stretched out comfortably in
bed when the pay-car hooted outside and
the clerk handed Baldy’s fortnightly pay-
envelope to Mrs. B. at the dodr. Baldy
had been doing his share of overtime, but
since it was his careful practice to give
his missus a fixed sum, she was unaware
of his real earnings. “What’s this?” she
exclaimed, rushing excitedly to Baldy’s
bedside. “Sixty-three pounds! I’ve never
seen so much money in me life! ” Baldy
flushed with irritation, but he was quick:
“Bloody fools!” he growled. “I told ’em
to take me mate’s pay out first before
bringin’ me mine.”

t
“Agricola”: You can still earn a quid
out in the brigalow-belt of W.Q., and
you don’t need a thousand-quid’s worth
of equipment, either. All you want
besides your roll is a Plumb or a Kelly
(B. 31/12/’5B). Landowners find it pays
to frill-ring the brigalow and kill it off
before pulling it with ball-and-chain. A
soft natural herbage rapidly covers the
ground among the dead trees. The dry
scrub burns better than if it had been
pulled green and allowed to dry. After
you’ve run -.out of ringing, you can
always „land a job picking-up sticks in
the burnt scrub. Stick-pickers are always
in short supply, possibly because nature
never intended man to get around with
his head lower than his hips. But there’s
no need to starve —the jobs are waiting.

“Murray Swagman”: The lawyer who
asked the sex of a colt (B. 19/11/’sB>
recalls G. A. Maxwell, a once-famous
Victorian barrister. He was "trying to
tangle-up a witness who was sure he
had identified a stolen colt, though it
had no brands or distinctive markings.
“How, then, could you be sure?”
Maxwell asked. “Had it any pecu-
liarities?” “Yes,” replied witness, “it had
an exceptionally small head for the size
of its body.” “How small?” asked
Maxwell ; “as small as mine, for in-
stance?” “Just about as long as yours,”
said the witness, “but not nearly as
thick.”

“Ebbu”: Gregory Peck, in Melbourne
as a star of the “On the Beach” film, is

a long way before Snowy Baker. Herbert
Asbury, in The Barbary Coast (pub-
lished in the Lf.S. in 1933) attributes them
to the Rev. William- Taylor. Taylor was
a pioneer street-preacher of the San
Francisco goldrush days. “While in Aus-
tralia in 1863,” Asbury says, “he sent his
wife several seedlings, which she duly
planted. From them came the giants
which now line the Californian high
ways.”

“J.K.H.”: The arrival of the big blue-
black koel, accompanied by his brcwn-
and-grey mate, was the signal for all the
other birds in the vicinity to mass and
make every effort to drive off the invaders.
They seemed to sense that the presence
of the intruders meant that one pair of
them was going to be chosen to hatch-out
and rear the greedy offspring of their
visitors. The pair chose a big weeping-
fig tree as their stronghold and took
cover in a thick patch of foliage where
it was impossible for their attackers to
hover threateningly overhead. From this
vantage-point the koels were able to
search every part of the tree for a nest

in which the hen could lay her egg. Fly-
ing about the enemy’s position were a
dozen peewees, several leatherheads, a few
starlings and, of course, the ever-present
pair of wagtails. When Mrs. Koel was
satisfied that she had drawn a blank and
flew off to try another tree she was chased
by the army of attackers, each taking a
turn to harass her as she flew. Pop Koel
took no part in the scrap, content to
barrack his lady from the cover of the
tree. After a lively half-hour, during
which every tree in the group was visited,
the hen called to her mate and flew off,
followed closely by that swain, while the
triumphant army of liberation winged its
way back to its domain.

“J.C.8.”: In a long lifetime of kick-
ing around the Queensland bush I have
often tangled with the stinging leaves
of the Gympie shrub (B. 14/1/’59). My
verdict: There’s nothing to equal the
sap of the bark of the shrub that stung
you. Moreover, it’s always right on hand
—which the cunjevoi mostly isn’t.

“Spin”: For as long as I can recall,
stockmen have been looking-out for
botfly-eggs on their horses’ necks and
manes and rubbing kerosene over them
(B. 21/1/’59). And I’ve had horses that
went mad if a bot came into the same
paddock with them —one in particular
being unsafe in an implement in bot
season. But I’ve never yet seen a horse
affected by them, and a vet. I once
worked for hadn’t either. There are as
many around my neck of the woods as
there ever were, so enough eggs must
be swallowed to perpetuate the species ;
but I think they’re a very overrated
danger.
“8.A.K.” : Our New Australian work-
mate is getting the hang of the slanguage
now, but the word “kick” had him
rattled for a long time. He was con-
fronted with the fact that you can get
a kick out of anything you like —liquor
with a kick in it, for example. You can
howl that a bloke’s being kicked when
he’s down, and dive into your kick to
give him a bit of a kick-along. You
can kick' over the traces if you feel’in-
clined, or kick-up a row when things -go
wrong. You could kick the mechanic
when the bus won’t kick-over or the
battery hasn’t got a kick in it. When we
, start a job we kick it off ; and eventually
we kick-out or kick-the-bucket.

Liewahlo”: Fledgling kingfisher,
harried by a couple of .magpies, flew
head-on into the wall and knocked him-
self insensible. Coming-to, he proved
himself an ungrateful little cuss, and
every blue-green feather bristle
with rage at an approaching hand. We
soon found there was little power in the
snapping beak, and for several days
forcibly fed him chopped-meat and
worms. A few days later, held arm-high,
he tried his wings and took-off, flying
into a clump of wattles. We saw two
older birds, which might have been his
parents, flying in and out of a round hole
in a termite’s nest in an ironbark. Would
that have been their nest, or a temporary
dining-room?
“You must get a snap of this to show the folks back homer!"

“C. Coral” : I see that my old stamping-
ground, Thursday Island, has had another
drought—in December rainfall was only
one-sixth of normal, and the Waiben had
to carry 200 tons of water to the island.
When in the ’seventies the authorities
were selecting a new site for the northern
outpost'in place of the old
settlement at Somerset,
various islands off Cape
York were considered,
among them Hammond,
Prince of Wales, Friday and
Thursday Islands, the latter
eventually beiig chosen,
mostly because of the
presence of fresh water.
Shortly after officials from
Somerset had removed to
T.I. under Lieutenant Henry
Chester, then Government
Resident, the new settlement
had a drought, and the
Government sloop Pearl
was ordered there with
water. Just as the ship
arrived the heavens opened
arid the skipper diced his
cargo into the harbor.


"THE FLAGS" HOTEL
[Portion of a letter from G. M. C. Dempsey,
Mosnam, N.S.W.]
My parents owned “The Flags,” referred
to on page 23 of The Bulletin,
February 11 [“Time Means Tucker,” by
“Duke” Tritton], until 1902, when they
rented the hotel and the adjacent grazing-
lands comprising some 1000 acres to
another licensee, who carried on the hotel
and resided there for several years, dur-
ing which the property was sold to
Winchcombe, Carson, Ltd.
“The Flags” itself comprised a large
residential building which included a
dormitory accommodating my eight
sisters in addition to the rooms respec-
tively occupied by my father and mother,
governess, my brother and myself, ample
accommodation for travellers as well as
men’s quarters. There was a large
orchard adjacent to the house, one 2000-
gallon tank and normal house-tanks (one
underground), butcher’s and blacksmith’s
shops, a large hall in which dances were
held regularly, and a store immediately
facing the Coolah Road.
It was not uncommon, particularly at
week-ends, for accommodation and meals
to be provided for up to 30 travellers and
guests, and on occasions during the hunt
for the Breelong outlaws (Jimmy and
Joe Governor) some 60 police were pro-
vided with meals.
1 find it very difficult to imagine that
such a place could, some three years after
we had left it, develop into a “shanty,”
nor can I believe that the person referred
to in the article as the publican would
be a party to what is now known as
“rolling drunks.”
AN "OUTBACK" DAY ?
[From Dame Mary G[?]more]
May I, as a continuous reader of The
Bulletin from its first issue (though
broken by my going to South America),
and as one who knows the bush, the
stations and the towns of “Time Means
Tucker,” thank H. P. Tritton for his
recollections, and The Bulletin for
publishing them?
This is the most necessary recording
of the history of the times and places,
and of the people who made Australia,
and gave us our outback and character.
They are Anzacs without officers or uni-
forms. But they first saw the sunburst
and wore the slouch-hat.
For this, and what they did, I wish
they could have a “day” and a march
through Sydney streets.
In regard to Alan Cunningham, the
Warrumbungles and the peach-trees from
the stones Cunningham planted, I
remember that in about 1874 my father
took us children over the Alan Cunning-
ham track to see the peach-trees grow-
ing in their scattered numbers. The fruit
was nearly ripe, but acrid and hard for
want of pruning. (The wood had gone
wild just as unpruned roses become
briar.)
Warrumbungle means “a bees’-nest in
every tree,” and I still recollect the never-
ceasing hum above our heads as we
drove under the dense bush.
But in “Time Means Tucker” there are
two things (and in such good work) that
broke my heart! One (and the worst)
is that the writer was allowed to use
“a hammer” on iron wedges for splitting
logs. Imagine the state of a man’s hands
in using iron on iron, instead of a maul
and wedges! A maul is necessary as the
wood in it cushions the blow to the
hands. The other thing is that Mr.
Tritton talked of buying “a buggy” when
he (surely) meant the kind of cart The
Bulletin artist drew for the means of
transport of the times.
The first buggy imported from the
U.S.A. was the Abbott. Up till then
there were springcarts, ordinary carts,
drays and wagonettes. All these carried
loads as well as people.
This refers to the bush. The cities and
towns had hansom cabs, carriages, Vic-
torias, gigs—and Abbott buggies.
HENDERSON OF ULIMAN
[From H. D. Mackie, Leura, N.S.w.]
T)resbyterian minister-emeritus, I, with
J. H. Dickson (B. 11/2/*59), enjoyed
“Duke” Tritton’s story of outback life,
and, with him, would like to get the
record straight.
John Henderson, as' “Duke” remarks,
was a very religious man, but (as my
outback parishioners would say), in spite
of that, he was “a hell of a good bloke.”
To get the record straight, let me correct
my parishioners and say not “in spite of
that,” but “because of that.”
Anyhow, “Duke” will be happy to
know that Henderson recovered from the
heavy blow of the hailstorm and the
mortgages of those days. I think, having
lifted the bank overdraft, he might have
spat on the banker’s office-floor. The
proof of this is that he gave a large
sum of money to my old friend John
Flynn to provide medical care, education,
friendship and other services to the
womenfolk, kids, drovers, stockmen, etc.,
READERS' COMMENTS ON
"TIME MEANS TUCKER"
in the outback of whom Tritton writes so
truthfully and kindly. They are still
getting the benefit of it.
To correct the apparent inconsistency
in that he forbade others that in which
he himself indulged—“booze was banned
on the place,” says “Duke,” “but I have
an idea that John was not averse to a
little Scotch whisky himself. Perhaps
the doctor ordered it”—let me observe
that shearing is an anxious, worrying
time. There might be cold snaps for
shorn sheep, or hailstones, and the
quicker shearing’s over the sooner.
But booze and shearing sometimes
won’t go together. The vital question is,
Does it make a man fall-down on his job?
Among employees of the station who
were his friends and co-operators in
building the wealth of Australia, Hender-
son might have preached and sung.
What’s wrong with singing, anyhow?
Did not Dutchy sing around the pubs
of the West for profit? Let Henderson
do so for pleasure, on his own dunghill!
But he had a sense of the value of
real religion in all denominations, and
thought it a duty to do what little he
could to fill up a gap in the life of out-
back people, in places such as Uliman,
where, like the outer Barcoo, the
churches are few and the men of religion
are scanty.
I confirm Tritton’s suspicions that John
was not averse to a little Scotch whisky.
On the only night I ever spent on
Uliman, many years ago, sitting by the
fire before going to bed, the old man
put down a bottle. The doctor had not
ordered it. He ordered it himself. He
ordered it for me. He would have
ordered one for Dutchy and Tritton had
they been there.
It only needed one of the good Bene-
dictine order to have blown in that night
with his assorted and Catholic contribu-
tion for satisfaction to have been com-
plete. It was a night of which I retain
grateful thoughts. Henderson had helped
me in struggling university days, unasked.
1 thank Tritton for reviving memories
of the long ago.
BUSH CHARACTERS
[From G. B. (Bin) Ensor, Toowoombr. Q.]
TTave just finished reading “Time
Means Tucker.” It' ever there was a
grand yarn (to me) this was it. As a lad
I learned to shear with “the blades,” and
have been through the life —shearing
(blades and machines), droving cattle
and sheep, racing (riding), brumby-run-
ning, fencing, mustering, branding, etc.,
— that “Duke” Tritton so vividly
describes. His portrayal of the old bush
characters is superb.
I have walked every yard and lived
every minute with him on his journey
in the outback. It’s a thousand pities that
we don’t see more of these old anecdotes.
He must be one of the last of the old-
timers.
Alas, in this atomic age life does not
hold the variety, interest and comrade-
ship that existed in the day of the
“blades,” when men were assessed on
their performance, not on their purse.
Best wishes to “Duke” Tritton. May
he get a good “stand” in the “shed here-
after.” I’m sure he’d put up a good
tally.
* * * *
[From “Bar ring unite”]
T Toed hard, “Duke” Tritton! Firstly,
Barringun is not on the Warrego
River (B. 21/1/ ’59), but half-a-mile
from, the Barringun Creek (known
in the old days as the “Stinking Lagoon”);
the country surrounding js not spinifex,
/ sand and brigalow, but open flood
country with an odd small patch of
red country. From Hungerford to
Barringun it is not spinifex country;
it includes some very heavy cypress-pine
country, and from the Irrara Creek, west
of the Warrego, right through to Barrin-
gun it is very heavy flood country tim-
bered with coolibah. By spinifex I fancy
you must mean the good old roly-poly,
which has prickles like needles.

THE FREAK UPSURGE
Arise to 555. last week in
B.H.P. shares preceded the
official announcement of a
one-for-five issue at par. At
Friday’s price of 545. 6d. the
theoretical ex-rights price be-
comes 48s. 9d., and the yield
3.4 p.c. on an 8| p.c. div. basis.
B.H.P.’s capital will now move
up into the vicinity of £64
million. Books close on April
17, and applications for the
shares, payable in two 10s.
instalments, will close on
June 15.
The sharemarket generally
was in a buoyant mood, and
most market leaders notched
records or near-records, though
the spirited bidding for B.H.P.
shares was rather exceptional.
A.C.I. at 635. 6d. and Burns
Philp at 655. were strong, and
interest was maintained right
through the share-list. If any
pattern could be discerned it
was of emphasis on the leaders
again, following a period in
which the second-liners had
experienced a good lift.
Among the second-liners,
however, interest was not lack-
ing where special merit pre-
viously unobserved was now
discernible or imagined. This
was so in the case of Allied
Mills and Johnson Leather.
The latest figures of the former
have been made available and
analysed. In the latter case
the market is acting on its own
initiative and intuition.
All concerns with interest in
TV - transmission have had
big rises. This applies
not only to Television Cor-
poration and Brisbane Tele-
vision, but to newspaper estab-
lishments with interests in TV
—there have been big lifts in
the shares of David Syme (Mel-
bourne “Age” and GTV,
Channel 9), Melbourne
“Herald” (HSV). John Fairfax
(Sydney “Herald”, and ATN),
and Consolidated Press (Sydney
“Telegraph” and TCN).
Investors are a little carried-
away with TV at present, in-
fluenced no doubt by results
of commercial TV in Britain.
But the set-up in Australia is
very different from that in the
U.K., and while profits are
generally being made by Syd-
ney and Melbourne tele-
casters, and the long-term out-
look is favorable, it is unlikely
that ihe TV ingredient will be
very important in newspaper-
co. dividends for some time.
As to the sharemarket gener-
ally, and the market leaders in
particular, immediate yields of
3| p.c. and less would indicate
that the flesh-and-blood in-
vestor is unlikely to grow fat
from investment in these over
the next five years, even though
they may suit the portfolio of
the institutional investor which
has a long term programme in
front of it.
The present sharemarket is
a freak market, the nature of
which has been explained
several times in these pages
over the past couple of years,
and investors who have
fattened from it have mostly
done so out of the pockets of
other (latecomer) investors, or
they have picked the more
meaty second-liners which are
distributing more of their
profits after completing their
expansion programmes. Some
of these second-liners have been
handsomely rewarding from
within their own efforts and
resources, but most of the
market leaders have been
ploughing-back their earnings
and showing a poor immediate
yield to investors.
As set-out in
since the beginning of the
present year, overseas share-
markets, and particularly the
U.S. market, are going through
a phase similar to that in Aus-
tralia, and for similar reasons.
Prosperity for the investor is
declared to be “just around
the corner,” like “recovery”
used to be during the depres-
sion. But in addition to this
prospect, the technical factors
are very similar to those pre-
vailing in Australia scrip-
shortage, debt-finance instead
of share-finance, institutional
buying outbidding the per-
sonal investor, and the added
inducement to holding scrip
even after it has had a good
rise—the 25 p.c. U.S. capital-
gains tax, which, of course, is
most unfair in view of the infla-
tionary element in any assumed
market profits.
Short-term Money Market
/'Aver the past two months
there have been periodic
releases of scrappy details
about the development of a
short-term money-market in
Australia, with the central
bank operating as a “lender of
last resort” to approved insti-
tutions.
From the beginning it was
anticipated that sharebroking
firms lan Potter and Co. and
J.B. Were and Son (both of
Melbourne) arid Ralph W.
King and Yuill (Sydney) would
be interested through separate
finance-companies, as well as
Development Finance Corpora-
tion, the international finance
co. which has varied interests
and shareholders, and which
has associations with Patrick
and Co., Sydney sharebrokers.
In the upshot, it has turned
out that way.
On February 17, the gov-
ernor of the Commonwealth
Bank, Dr. H. C. Coombs,
announced that the bank,
following application from
interested dealer - companies,
had agreed to enter into
arrangements with a number
of dealer-companies acting in
the short-term money-market
under which the bank, sub-
ject to certain requirements
and conditions, has established
a relationship of “lender of
last resort” in the form of a
line of credit for each com-
pany.

are:
Capel Court Securities Pty., Ltd.
(Melbourne). Delfin Discount Com-

All of these companies, Dr.
Coombs confirmed, have close
associations with sharebroking
firms whose partners are
members of one or other of
the Australian Stock Ex-
changes.
The investment-portfolios of
the authorised dealers will for
the time being be confined to
money-market securities which
have been defined as Com-

ceeding three years. The line

of credit will be made available
only against lodgment with the
bank by the dealers of money-
market securities.
It has not been stated defi-
nitely as to what interest-rates
will be offered by the dealer-
companies for short-term
loans, or what “backstop” rate
the central bank will charge if
they need “last-resort” finance.
But it would seem that the
approved dealer-companies will
have their activities restricted
at the beginning, if the state-
ment of the central-bank
governor be taken literally.
Borrowing by dealer-com-
panies (apart from “last-resort”
aid from the central bank) will
be from a variety of temporary
(sometimes seasonal) sources,
usually for a short term, but
tending to level-out at a fairly
constant figure because of turn-
over of funds. It is essentially
cheap money.
The investment in short-
term (three years and under)
Government securites will not
permit investment on any scale
in the new Special Bonds, even
though these are repayable by
the Treasury on one month’s
notice. Under the terms of
issue, no one person (or body)
may hold more than £5009-
worth of these bonds.
Puri Programme
[From L,. Owen]
TCollowing a meeting in
A London, the operating-
companies in West Papua have
decided to concentrate im-
mediate drilling activities in the
Puri area.
This decision should be
gratifying to Oil Search share-
holders particularly as the
programme includes the sink-
ing of a borehole on the Bwata
structure, which is closely
related to the Puri fold, at a
location about 15 miles north-
west of Puri. Tentatively, it is
proposed, also, to drill another
well on the Puri fold itself. All
that is sound geological and
commonsense.
As has already been pointed
out (B. 12/11 / ’5B), the oil
produced from the Puri hole
is obviously migrated—a fea-
ture common to all petroleum
manifestations (some measure-
able, but mostly consisting of
traces of “colors”) encountered,
so far, within the Papuan
Miocene.
The sequence of “wet” gas,
and condensate, and, after
acidising, light crude and,
finally, brine, from the 7460-
7508 ft. limestone zone in Puri
1 is strongly suggestive of
passage through a “tight”
material containing porous and
permeable lenses.
That passage may, quite
possibly, have been in a lateral
direction, and, if one or both
of the deviated Puri boreholes
strike the limestone outside the
tight zone, there is quite a good
chance of commercial produc-
tion. Even if the deviated-well
technique fails to strike a
porous and permeable condi-
tion, the drilling of the Bwata
well, and of Puri 2, will be
amply justified.
I hope, however, that one
or both of lhese boreholes will
be either to production

AS CANADA SEES THE PROBLEM
IN a speech to the Canadian
Club of Toronto last
month, Donald Fleming,
the Minister of Finance,
said that 1958 will be
remembered as a year when
recession was arrested and the
underlying strength of the
Canadian economy asserted
itself in a gratifying recovery.
Notwithstanding the set-
backs —abnormal unemploy-
ment and soft spots in certain
sectors of the economy —1958
had been marked by important
achievements, the Minister said.
Mr. Fleming pointed-out that
1959 has begun with many
early advantages over 1958.
The domestic improvement is
matched by an improvement in
conditions in the United States
and abroad which will un-
doubtedly benefit Canada.
Fleming termed the Cana-
dian Conversion Loan opera-
tion the most successful finan-
cial operation in Canada’s
history. Explaining the back-
ground of the Conversion
Loan, he said that a decline
in bond prices began in the
United States in April, 1958,
and was followed by a decline
in Canada.
“By the end of June,” he
went on, “the market atmo-
sphere was very unfavorable to
new financing ; yet the Govern-
ment of Canada needed large
sums of new money in the
immediate future Some
way had to be found to reduce
the heavy proportion of short-
term bonds and increase sub-
stantially the proportion of
long-term bonds.
“Fundamental to the project
was the idea that it would be
easier to sell the public long-
term bonds in exchange for
bonds which they already held
than to sell them long-term
bonds for cash. The prospec-
tive cash requirements of the
Canadian Government for
several years ahead were also
a major consideration. It was
urgently important to improve
the Government debt-structure,
to reduce the overhang of
refinancing which would have
The success of the
recent Australian con-
version - loan was a
pleasant surprise for the
Treasury.
It is interesting to
find, from the accom-
panying article, that
Canada in 1958 had
similar surprising success
with its conversion.
Other aspects of the
Canadian economy ring
a bell in Australia as
well.
to be-done in addition to new-
money financing, and to put
as much of the Government’s
debt as possible on a long-term
basis.
Conversion Loan Success
“The terms of the Conver-
sion Loan were developed on
the best advice, having regard
for the objective, the erosion
which had occurred in the
market, and the measures
necessary to attract public
investment in the long-term
sector. The Conversion Loan
was an overwhelming success.
A total of more than $5803-
million, or more than 90 per
cent, of the outstanding Victory
Bonds, was converted....
“While prices of Govern-
ment bonds have declined in
the last two months, the bene-
fits of the Conversion Loan
operation continue. I should
add a comment on the market-
price quotations on the new
Counversions bonds.
“The Government at no time
said it would support the cur-
rent market prices on the Con-
version Loan. While the Bank
of Canada, acting as the
Government’s fiscal agent, nor-


mally operates in a manner to
stabilise the ‘after-market’ for
a short period after each new
loan, it is not the Government’s
policy to ‘support the bond-
market’ over longer periods.
The Government’s obligation is
to pay the fixed rate of interest
on the Conversion Loan bonds
and redeem them in full at
maturity....”
Inflation Fears
Of inflation, Mr. Fleming
said:
“The air has been filled of
late with talk of inflation. It
is said that the fear of infla-
tion is disturbing confidence in
Canada’s financial outlook. If
it is, the condition is certainly
not confined to Canada. The
United States is displaying all
of the symptoms which are
said to exist at present in
Canada.
“I do not deplore the current
evidence of concern over infla-
tion. On the contrary, I think
it is a healthy sign that people
are showing concern for the
preservation of the purchasing-
power of the Canadian dollar.
That degree of public concern
will, I trust, assist Govern-
ments and others in grappling
with the problem. I am con-
cerned, however, that the dis-
cussion of this subject should
be realistic and balanced. The
danger of inflation exists, as it
has existed for the last 20 years.
We will not, however, over-
come it by exaggerating it
beyond all recognition.
“Indeed, just as a year ago
gloomy and exaggerated talk
about recession and unemploy-
ment actually enlarged the
dimensions of these problems
by disturbing confidence, so
we can today actually bring on
some of the feared effects of
inflation by yielding to an un-
warranted inflation psychology.
The current situation is cer-
tainly not one of overt inflation
but of the fear of inflation.
Inflation has been defined as
‘too many dollars chasing too
lew goods.’ There is, however,
certainly no scarcity of goods
in Canada. The problem with
respect of most products and
commodities is that we have
surpluses of them.
“One would expect to find
inflation reflected in the con-
sumer price-index. Tne index
in December, however, showed
a slight reduction. Over the
last year the index has risen
only 2.5 per cent. How modest
is this rise may be seen when
it is compared with rises of
6 per cent, in 1946, 15 per cent,
in 1947, 7 per cent, in 1948 and
10 per cent, in 1951. Of the
slight increase in 1958, little
was in the prices of goods—
food, fuel or clothing. The
greater part of it was in the
cost of services, especially
health-care, personal care and
recreation.
“One would also expect to
find inflation reflected in the
wholesale price-index. How-
ever, the general wholesale
price-index is the same as it
was a year ago. It is also 16
points, or 7 per cent., below the
1951 figure....
“There is no evidence in
recent events of themselves to
justify anxiety over inflation.
1 am aware, however, of con-
cern over the long-term trend.
Since 1946, the Canadian
dollar, as measured by the
consumer price-index, has lost
forty cents of its purchasing-
power. Nearly all of that loss
occurred prior to 1952; rela-
tively little of it occurred in
the last two years. The present
problem of inflation arises in
its creeping form.
“I think I have been as out-
spoken as anyone in warning
the Canadian public of the
dangers of inflation. It is a
stealthy thief, reducing the
value of savings, fixed incomes,
insurance-policies, bonds, pen-
sions, mortgages. I hope the
Canadian people will always be
on their guard against inflation.
It is well to remind ourselves,
however, that there is little
value in deploring inflation
while at the same time seeking
the illusory, will-of-the-wisp
advantages it appears to offer.
Who Is to Blame?
“It is also well for us to
jealise precisely where respon-
sibility lies in this regard. It is
temptingly easy for individuals
to place the full blame and
responsibility on the Govern-
ment or Governments. The
fact is that in a free economy
every citizen has a responsi-
bility to play his part in the
maintenance of the stability
and purchasing-power of the
Canadian currency. This
solemn duty, rests upon
employers, employees and self-
employed.
Productivity and Incomes
I repeat the stern warning
which I issued in my Budget
speech on June 17 last:
Moreover, I confess my concern
over costs of production and prices
in Canada. Only by keeping our
costs of production in line with
those of our competitors can we
hope to achieve expanding employ-
ment and progressive improvement
in our standard of living.
We are in danger of becoming a
high-cost economy. Such a pros-
pect is particularly perilous in the
case of a country like Canada, which
must sell so much of its production
in markets abroad. Moreover,
Canadian producers are encounter-
ing increasing difficulty in retaining
their domestic market in the face
of keen competition from abroad.
Many of them, under these circum-
stances, turn to the Government for
a solution of their cost problem.
In a free society there is no
simple formula by. which the
Government can maintain stable
prices, and there is a limit to what
Governments can do to assist pro-
ducers to hold down their costs of
production. A wise Government
can, of course, help to promote an
environment which is conducive to
price-stability, and this Government
gives a high place to that duty; but
to an important extent, prices are
the result of competition among the
various economic groups which
compose our nation, each striving
for a greater share of the national
product.
I echo the warnings issued by the
Prime Minister, Mr. Diefenbaker, to
all sections of the Canadian people
in appealing to all, whether
employers, employees or self-
employed, to have regard for the
general interest in the returns they
seek for their services and pro-
ducts. In a free society there is no
omnipotent arbitrator who can set
prices and wages at stable levels.
One must depend upon the sense of
responsibility of free men and
women not to demand more than
their fair share of the national
income. As 1 have said on other
occasions, increases in incomes can
be justified by increased productivity
and by increased productivity
a10ne....
“The policy of the Canadian
Government is quite clear. It
was stated by the Prime
Minister and myself on July 14
when launching the Conversion
Loan campaign. On that
occasion he said:
“ ‘One of the primary advan-
tages which will, 1 am sure,
commend itself to all of you, is
that it [the Conversion Loan]
is in every sense anti-
inflationary. It is, even more
definitely, a sound-money
policy.... I want to emphasise
again at this time that the
preservation of a sound cur-
rency and the maintenance of
stability in the value of the
dollar are matters to which the
Government attaches th e
greatest importance....’
“This remains, let it be said,
the policy of the Govern-
ment ....
“The prospects before this
country are dazzling bright.
There never was a time when
Canadians had more reason for
confidence in their country and
her future.”
Victorian Hotels
'T'jtere was a certain amount
* of cynicism when Mel-
bourne hotelkeepers first began
to complain that times were
hard. But the evidence mounts
that they mean it. Nobody
voluntarily puts up the
shutters on a goldmine. The
latest of the many in the past
year or so to announce its
imminent departure from the
trade is the old Metropole
Hotel in Bourke Street. Its
owners are trying to sell it.
They will ask to be relieved of
its licence as soon as the deal
goes through.
There are many factors—
high costs, high excise,
changing tastes—in these fold-
ings-up of familiar haunts.
City sites that can be con-
verted into office-blocks are
clearly getting 100 valuable to
sustain small or medium-size
old hotels. Nevertheless, bar
facilities are declining rela-
tively as fast as the Melbourne
population grows.
This seems to point to an
intensification of the crush in
the establishments that remain
open and popular. It points
also to the need for a rationali-
sation and modernisation of
the whole rigid, regulation-
ridden licensing system and an
overdue adult approach to
normal tastes.

The Myer Bowl
It being an important event
in Melbourne’s musical and
civic history, The Bulletin
put on its best suit and
attended the lifting of the lid
of the Myer Music Bowl, and,
having been given a privileged
seat among the mighty under
the vast fishskin-like canopy,
sat in terror throughout the
proceedings.
The night was hot and
humid, an ink-black cloud
filled the sky behind, and
thunder muttered while, on the
vast fan-shaped slope of earth
converging on the bowl or
hole or funnel sat 30,000
murmuring people, looking like
nothing so much as an immense
bed of tuberous begonias.
Being of a nervous —or, if
you like, imaginative—disposi-
tion, one couldn’t help think-
ing of what might happen if the
cloud broke into one of those
torrential downpours which
Melbourne knows how to
produce at the wrong moments.
The dusty slope would then
become a raging torrent ; the
200 miles of seats would be
converted into miniature
Niagaras; and the privileged
few and the unprivileged many
would be swept down in a
struggling mass on top of Sir
Dallas Brooks, Mr. Menzies,
Mr. Kenneth Myer, the Lord
Mayor, Dr. Subandrio, the
Melbourne and Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestras, the con-
ductor, the soloist and the
hordes of technicians. What a
setting that would provide for
Mr. Stanley Kramer! And
what a bon mot for the im-
perturbable Mr. Menzies!
It was an irrational dread,
of course. There is no reason
to suppose that the architects
and builders haven’t attended
to such a simple problem as
drainage—it is the artistic side,
if anything, they have fallen
down on.
Despite its impressive
statistics—4o,ooo cubic-yards
of earth excavated, 15,000 ft. of
cable, 6000 square-feet of stage,
two 72ft. prefabricated steel
masts looking like gigantic
cigars encased in silver sheet-
ing the Bowl is not im-
pressive in appearance. The
canopy recalls Wirth’s big-top
in process of removal to a new
stand, and the Bowl doesn’t
look like a bowl but a burrow
badly camouflaged with con-
crete and bluestone and cul-
minating in something like a
section of Sydney’s under-
ground and not a bit like a
shrine to the Muse of music.
The concert programme at
the opening was in tune with
the architecture: designed to
suit all tastes. The best things
in it were the fanfare specially
composed by Dr. Clive
Douglas, and the Essay for
“See, SOMEONE remembered what day it was!"
Orchestra, by Melbourne com-
poser Robert Hughes. The
Gershwin concerto was a very
slight thing to put before such
talented musicians as Alfred
Wallenstein, Andor Foldes,
Bertha Jorgensen, Ernest
Llewellyn and the combined
orchestras.
As Mr. Menzies, with his
flair for the felicitous phrase,
said, Sidney Myer was great
as a merchant, citizen and
idealist. Suiting all tastes may
have been Myer’s ideal for his
emporia, but it is doubtful if
it would have been his ideal
for the first concert in his bowl
of music, which was inspired by
the conclusion he came to
towards the end of his career
that happiness was not in
material things but in the mind.
However, the Bowl is there
and is wonderful, if weird ; its
acoustics —inside, outside and
on the rim—seem wellnigh
perfect, and its future is
assured.
❖ *> *l*
Concerto Festival
In the first two concerts of
the Festival, Sir Bernard Heinze
conducted the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra, and the
soloist, Hungarian-born pianist
Andor Foldes, weaved his way
through five concertos.
First was Bach’s No. 1 in
D Minor. Here the piano has
the place formerly occupied by
a group of instruments in the
old concerto grosso form. It
is given no flights of bravura,
no dominant voice: keyboard
and small string orchestra
chatter in lucid colloquy.
Foldes revealed the intricate
pattern of the work with firm-
ness, clarity and almost perfect
phrasing.
Liszt’s No. 1 in E Flat was
handled with no little spirit;
the rhythmic embroideries
were sharply pointed-up, and
the contrasting adagio was a
stream of melodic serenity.
The orchestra’s work here was
particularly attractive.
Bartok’s Second, full of
sinewy rhythms, cacophonic
outbursts and battles between
keyboard and blaring brasses,
was scarcely suited to Foldes’s
essentially classic style. It was
in the Beethoven No. 1 that
he showed his full stature. The
first movement was vigorous,
fresh and buoyant, emphasis-
ing the unmistakable Beeth-
oven boldness in a work which,
for the rest, is suffused with
the spirit of Haydn and
Mozart. In the concluding
rondo, where clarity of
rhythm and melodic outline
demand that the tempo be kept
from loosening into a gallop,
Sir Bernard showed firm con-
trol. It was as sparkling a
reading as Sydney has heard in
years, and, above all, under-
lined, orchestrally, the bois-
terous good spirits of the first
section.
The Brahms First, with its
undercurrents of tragedy,
found the pianist at his best
in the episodes of serious
dialogue with the orchestra,
though the profundities of the
slow section were slightly short
in weight. The rhapsodic
utterances were fervently
made, and the structure was
always kept within the bounds
of keyboard decorum, for this
work is anything but showy.
The orchestral fabric was
always strong.

“Moby Dick”
Sydney's Pocket Playhouse
pounders of the boards have
never been afraid to tackle
anything: this time they fill
their narrow stage with the
good ship Pequod, the mad
captain Ahab, the pacifist first-
mate Starbuck, the visionary
sole survivor Ishmael and the
powerfully imagined whale.
As the captain, Brian Farmer
realised the fineness of an inner
mania gradually rising to a
crescendo of hate for Moby
Dick. Towards the end of the
second act his portrait lost a
little of its tautness ; there was
too much general hurriedness ;
and he wasn’t helped by Bruce
Lowndes, who, as Stub the
second - mate, persisted in
grinning even in the most
serious spots. But in his final
oration, when he meets the
whale, Farmer excelled: it
seemed that all the knots in
Ahab’s disordered personality
unravelled simultaneously.
Ishmael was well played by
Donald Smith; Peter Potok
made a noble figure of Quee-
queg; Pip, the negro cabin-
boy, was a bit too obviously a
girl (Diane Sanderson); and
Father Mapple, the preacher
who periodically appears in a
front-stage pulpit, was capably
presented by Seamus Rothsey.
Production, Norman Mc-
Vicker.

“Mary of Magdala”
The most obvious quality in
Sydney Genesians’ new show
is sincerity; some individual
portraits rescue Ernest Milton’s


play from its frequent senti-
mental shallows.
The play shows Mary mov-
ing from a life of dedicated
discontent to spiritual aware-
ness ; the turning-point the
raising of Jairus’s son from the
dead. It resolves into a clash
of values: Mary is a new
but Quintus, her
protector, will have none of it.
Undoubtedly Tessa Hughes,
as Mary, captured the play's
v implications and stirred the
hearts of her fellow-actors, ofJ
whom Michael Pope, as Bod-
min the young Briton, gradu-
ally increased in confidence,
until in the last act he stood
out quite powerfully. Ron
Tunstall took the minor part
of Elkan, a youth from Naim ;
Mary’s maid Zillah< (Kath_
Scott) was a pleasing study ;
and as Quintus, Mary’s protec-
tor, James Quinn, while not as
assured as one would have
liked, had his moments—the
spot, for instance, where he
pauses and flatly denies his
belief.

Bogies /
An exhibition from the Mel-
bourne “Museum Of Modern
Art” at David Jones’, Sydney,
offers the extraordinary spec-
tacle of 20 or more artists all
paint hg, with considerable
variety of styles, exactly the
same subject—an enlarged
human head.
Why they should all paint
this one subject, or why this
one subject was selected for
the exhibition, is not stated.
Perhaps there was a competi-
tion for enlarged human heads,
and they all won it.
Or perhaps, like the fat boy
in “Pickwick,” everybody
wants to make people’s flesh
creep: in which case it is
rather a pity that someone
didn’t think of painting the fat
boy. He woujd make an excel-
lent subject.
At any rate, Charles Black-
man’s “Alice in Wonderland”
is a very striking female bogy-
man or bogygirl; Arthur
Boyd’s “The Lovers,” with one
enlarged head embracing
another under a gumtree, is a
nice double bogy; Mary
Boyd’s “Hands,” surprisingly
enough, is a Mouth; Robert
Dickerson’s “Bather” is his
usual bathing-bogy; Hester
Joy has a “Mad Girl,” a “Girl
and Hen” and also a disem-
bodied fat head strangling it-
self ; John Perceval (but surely
he also paints seascapes?) has
a bogy named “Survival”;
Gray Smith has a fossicker
who looks a little like the poet
John Masefield ; and Albert
Tucker has a bogyboy from
Fishermen’s Bend arid a bat-
eared bogy clown.
And so one comes to the
grand champion of bogyland,
Sidney Nolan’s “Ned Kelly”—
looking, as has been remarked
before, like a TV-aerial.
There is a whole set of these
Kelly paintings, with Powe£
and his peacock, and the cops
under the bed at Sherritt’s, and
Constable Fitzpatrick making
treacherous love to Kate, and
horses falling upside-down over
the clifftops, and policemen
exploding in mid-air, and
Heaven knows what not; and,
with some very nice touches of
landscape, a most charming
and amusing set they are —
as long as you take them as
a fairytale and don’t take them
any more seriously than that.
Here and there a painting
that isn’t a bogyman shines
like a good deed in this ex-
ceedingly naughty world:
Samuel Atyeo’s “Portrait of
Joan Burbury,” Josl Bergner’s
green slum, Moya Dyring’s
“Portrait,” Jon Molvig’s swirl-
ing “Coast Landscape” and a-
couple of lively pieces from
Albert Tucker’s surrealist
period—-but really the bogies
steal* the show.
Also among them are two
self-portraits of “Professor
Tipper” riding his bicycle; a
curious thing about these
attractive “primitives,” which
were discovered by the Angry
.Penguins, is how closely the
professor’s - backgrounds re-
semble those of Sidney Nolan
and Arthur Boyd.

Vanguard
The Terry Clone Galleries,
King’s Cross, has a show called
“Vanguard Painters.” This
seems a very extravagant claim 1
to make. None of them looks
in the least like a motor-car.
But quite a few of them look
like, painters: notably Reinis
Zusters, _ in his dazzling
“George Street”; John Stod-
dart, in a rich and intricate
abstract; Beatrice Kelly, in
some loose purple “Elms”;
Ross King, in some decorative
and derivative streets; and
Mary Brady, in her figures and
still-life from Cezanne.

Eights
Sydney Macquarie Galleries
has a show of “eights”:
“Wind,” by Judy Cassab;
“Venetian Still - life,” by
Kenneth Hood; “City from
Darling Harbor,” by George
Lawrence ; “Figure Study,” by
Murch ; “Towrang,” by Wil-
liam Salmon (very firm; but
his style looks a bit too
antiquated and needs freshen-
ing) and, very light and airy
from this sombre painter,
“Bush Country,” by J. Caring-
ton Smith. With some 55
others—some too dear at eight
guineas, but many a bargain.

Films
“The Defiant Ones”
This film, now at Melbourne
Capitol, is something of a
parable, simple and powerful,
on the problfem of integration.
A white convict and a negro
who are chained together
escape when the van which is
taking them from one prison
to another is wrecked. They
are chased by a sheriff who
hates his job, by police-dogs
and a police-chief who love it
and by dogs which are impar-
tial in the matter. Though
harmony is essential if they are
to avoid recapture, the chained
men hate each other like
poison. Even when they are
clambering out of the mud of
a claypit, being rolled over
rapids and sinking into quick-
sands their racial prejudices
persist, and they snarl and claw
at each other like animals.
The negro wants to go south
and the white man north. They
narrowly escape lynching.
They reach a lonely farm-
house where a woman who
has been deserted by her hus-
band helps them to cut their
fetters. They are now capable
of independent action, but they
can’t part. The woman sees
in the white man a possible
escape from her isolation, and
she offers her car —but she
doesn’t want the black man.
The white man finds that he
can’t desert the black man with
whom he has shared such hor-
rible misadventures, and their
frightful odyssey ends in their
being recaptured together.
Despite its brutality, violence
and horror, there is a gentle-
ness about this film which
makes a positive appeal. The
acting of Tony Curtis, as the
white man, is as telling as that
of Sidney Poitier, the negro.

“Stella”
This Greek film, at Mel-
bourne Savoy, has directness,
a grim intensity and stark
inevitability. The story is the
universal one of the plight of
the lover who becomes the
beloved.
Melina Mercouri, a wonder-
ful actress, is the beloved. She
is a cabaret-singer and not a
very good one, but she wants
to enjoy life and doesn’t want
to be handcuffed to marriage
Her young aristocratic lover,
unfortunately, wants to marry
her and make her into a lady.
He is not in love with her but
with what she symbolises—
marriage. When she tires of
his whining and complaining
he suicides.
By way of solace she fails in
love with a footballer, who
no doubt symbolises an
Olympic hero for her. What
he wants, however, is a good
cook and a mother for his
children. When she fails to
arrive at the church and
solaces herself with another
lover, the footballer becomes
the injured and insulted.
They meet in a public square
at five in the morning. They
walk towards each other. He
cries: “Stella, run—l am going
to kill you.” But she keeps
walking. He duly kills her, and
is holding up her body weep-
ing when the police arrive.

boy ironically chooses law as

is called to the Bar, Redgrave,
after a particularly long stretch
of “evangelism,” is wealthy
enough to retire for life to an
idyllic fishing-village.
But his inability to resist a
dabble in the aft of fishing for
inflatable rubber sharks (filled
with contraband cognac) brings
him back to the. arms of the
“church” ; and then he learns
that his son is associate to the
judge who has sent him on
many previous missions and is

Redgrave’s colleagues rally
round him, and the ingenuity
they use to keep the son away
from the trial provides a set
of rich climaxes leading to a
warm and human untangling.

with Robert Morley, whose
judge is a compelling mixture
of arrogance and meticulous-
ness.

“The Man Inside”
This crime-drama is so con-
cerned with thrills that such
matters as logic and episodic
co-ordination are largely over-
looked. It also suffers from in-
different casting. Jack Palance,
convincing enough in roles of
wolfish villainy, is here a
private-eye assigned to recover
a fabulous jewel. The trail
takes him to several European
capitals ; and though the flee-
ing thief murders prolifically to
shake-off pursuit, Palance takes
it all in the picnic spirit.
Nigel Patrick, as the
debonair clerk who plans and
executes the theft, does well
enough in his struggle with a
plot that uses enough red-
herrings to stock a fishmarket.

An organisation of the calibre of

Big as is 1.C.1.A.N.Z., it is dwarfed

imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., with

of technology and for which it acts as
selfing-agent in Australia.
The world-wide group manufactures

Group sales in 1957 totalled £463
million, and the U.K. parent’s post- tax
income alone was over £22 million.
The Australasian offshoot was formed
in 1928, post-dating by only two years
the incorporation of Imperial Chemical
Industries, Ltd., in the United Kingdom,
itself the outcome of n a merger of
Brunner Mond and Co., Ltd., Nobel
Industries, Ltd., United Alkali Co., Ltd.,
and British Dyestuffs Corp., Ltd.
The Australian public didn’t come into
the picture until 1938, and then only to
the tune of £1,000,000 of 5 p.c. prefs. No
ords. became public property until 1950,
when there was an issue of 1,006,505,
each carrying a premium of 2s. 6d. The
same premium was carried by a further
35-for-JOO issue in 1952.
A glance at the Australasian sub-
group’s results for 1957 and 1958 shows
an accommodating rise in net profit fol-
lowing the recent gathering-in of ordinary
capital.
A two-for-five issue of 20s. ords. at
ss. premium has added £4,860,000 to
paid capital over the 1957 and 1958 terms,
and during the same period consolidated
net profit made a sharp advance from
£2,371,296 to £3,007,129.
No detailed information is given
regarding the operations of various sub-
sidiaries, some of them quite large entities
in their own right, but the £2,064,638
(up £279,088) provided for taxation and
the £1,847,924 (up £276,499) charged for
depreciation on fixed assets, deducted to
arrive at consolidated net profit, seems
to accord fairly well with published
results:

Last year’s fourth-time-up 9 p.c. ord.
dividend, and the 5 p.c. pref., together
absorbing £1,50&,000, took little more
than half the net earnings. There was
£1,499,129 to be added to reserves out of
profits and a further £914,336 came by
way of share-premiums, capital-gains and
other sundries as interlined in the profit
table. Tangible reserves now total
£10,629,576 and net tangible cover for
the 20s. ords. is 325. 6d. each.
A company whose products range
from slide-fasteners and centre-fire cart-
ridges to dyestuffs and anaesthetics doesn’t
lend itself readily to a bird’s-eye view.
Explosives, fertilisers, pharmaceuticals,
plastics, synthetics—virtually all basic
industrial chemicals are manufactured
locally or imported from the parent for
resale.
Of particular note from the Australian
point of view is the steady rise in sales
of the synthetic fibre Terylene, which is
mainly used in blends with other fibres,
including wool.
Also welded into the group’s structure
is B.A.L.M. Paints Pty. (70 p.c. held),
and the Newcastle Chemical Co. is
operated equally with B.H.P.
In New Zealand the stricter import-
licensing and the elimination of
preferential treatment for imports from
the U.K. will probably haye some effect
on company sales, which last term rose
by nearly one-quarter. Manufacturing
subsidiaries —B.A.L.M. has a plant there
—will probably be able to consolidate
their position.
Balance-sheet movements are in line

There are no worries on the score of
working-capital, with more-or-less liquid
assets, £26,395,331, nearly double current
liabilities. In any case, the company has
only to snap its fingers to get in all the
fixed-interest money it requires on the
best terras available.
In its 1950-52 issue of the £6-million
of mortgage-debentures, redeemable half
in 1965-70, half in 1967-72, the company
had the best of the bargain, since it has
to find only £240,000 (4 p.c.) per annum
for interest payments, which are, of
course, deductions from taxable, income.
Under existing conditions, the £500,000,
harvested last term from an issue of 64
p.c. unsecured notes also represented
inexpensive money.
Obviously the company is sound
beyond reproach. But the same can’t be
said of the sharemarket. Even for a blue-
chip like 1.C.1.A.N.Z. the present yield
of 2.9 p.c. from a market price of 635.
is miserable. The disclosed earning-rate
on average ordinary capital has continued
to increase steadily—it was 18.2 p.c. last
year, compared with 17.9 p.c., 17.3, 17.1,
14.4 and 11.6 back to 1953—but the
earnings yield is still only 5.7 p.c. on
present values.
Amalgamated Wireless (A’sia), Ltd.
A malgamated Wireless had proved a
robust and reliable profit-winner long
before the TV-receiver began its
triumphant march into the drawing-
rooms of Australian suburbia, but what
is described as “the general acceptance
of television” rocketed the co. far above
all previous peaks of prosperity last term.
Out of the record showing, A.W.A.
was able to pay a 14 p.c. div. on a paid
capital doubled in the preceding term
by a one-for-one bonus-issue and still
send to reserves an amount greater than
the whole of the better-than-average net
profit claimed in the 1956-57 term. And,
although TV-earnings may recede some-
what, and competition continue to trim

profit-margins, there seems little reason
to expect a severe and abrupt contrac-
tion in earnings, even if the recent de-
cline in TV-sales proves to be less of
a seasonal variation than is thought by
some manufacturers. For, apart from
the impression of caution, rather than
over-optimism, given by the accounts and
the fact that, as yet, Sydney and Mel-
bourne TV-markets are by no means
saturated, the co. stands to benefit as
a manufacturer of both domestic and
commercial TV-equipment from the ex-
tension of services to other capital-cities
(within the next two years), while the
increasing applications of electronic
equipment are steadily widening the
number of prospective customers.
A.W.A. installed four of the six TV-
stations licenced in Victoria and N.S.W.
and has since secured orders for the
national stations in Brisbane, Adelaide
and Perth and for the studio-equipment
in these cities and in Hobart. More re-
cently, a N.Z. Government contract was
obtained covering radio - transmitters
capable of operating the most,powerful
medium-wave broadcasting-station in the
southern hemisphere.
In a sharemarket prepared to pay well
for first-class scrip, the f.-p. ss. ords.
bring around 19s. 6d., giving buyers at
this price a return of £3 7s. 2d. p.c. from
a 14 p.c. distribution. On last term’s
figures, capitalisation of the market-
premium would give an earnings-yield
of 7.7 p.c. Net tangible cover at June
30 last (parents accounts only) was
10s. 4d.
Interested, as either manufacturer,
distributor or shareholder, in practically
all aspects of the television and radio
industries, A.W.A. turns-out a full range
of receiving- and transmitting-equipment,
as well as radar-devices, navigational aids,
tape-recorders, etc., and a host of com-
ponents, including such basic items as
valves, picture-tubes, speakers and, in
the near-future, transistors. The co. also
markets refrigerators, washing-machines,
electric-ranges, air-conditioning units and
film-projectors, produces radio- and TV-
programmes, presses phonograph-records,
owns a chain of eight radio-stations (of
which 2CH, Sydney, is the largest) and
holds a substantial share-interest in a
Sydney TV-station, which, in turn, is a
shareholder in one of the newly-licensed
Brisbane stations.
Although the local' market is the
biggest source of income by far, A.W.A.
has been particularly successful as an
exporter of both capital- and consumer-
goods, especially to buyers in Africa,
Asia and the Pacific Islands. The use
of the co.’s equipment in the Comet 4
jet-airliner, now in regular service across
the Atlantic, Js indicative of the co.’s
standing in world markets.
The telecommunication side of the
business, on which A.W.A. was
nationalised in 1946, the compensation
received enabling the return of 11s. 6d.
per £1 share along with a cash bonus
of 575. 7d., paid capital dropping-back
to £418,845. Since then shareholders
have put-up £568,882 of new share-
capital and £376,719 of premiums, and,
over the same period, collected £1,238,136
in bonus scrip (most of which came
from the one-for-one issue mentioned
earlier). All in ords., paid capital now
stands at £2,225,863, another £774,137
of 6y p.c. notes being convertible into
ords. in June 1962.
An interesting feature of last term’s
trading was a 20 p.c. improvement in
sales of radio-receivers, but the televi-
sion side of the business was, of course,
mainly responsible for the £5.2-million
leap (to £13.4 million) in total revenue.
Lumped together in the accounts, costs,
expenses and provisions lose by £4.9
million to something over £12.7 million
and included £236,787 (up £28,491) “re-
served or written - off for depreciation”
and over £2.5 million (up approximately
*£l.l million) for rates and taxes of all
kinds.
At £671,073, net profit was 95 p.c.
(£327,575) higher than the previous
term’s effort and equal to 30.1 p.c. on
share-capital, as against 15.4 p.c. in
1956-57:

A.W.A. hasn’t passed a div. for over
30 years, last term’s payout, lifted from
9 p.c. to 14 p.c. (10 p.c. basic div., 4 p.c.
bonus), calling for £311,621. This left
£359,452, along with an £8837 capital-
profit, to swell the already-sizeable net
reserves to £2,436,485, excluding the
hefty, £1,864,352 “reserve” for deprecia-
tion.
In addition to the reserves indicated
above, the co., last term, brought to
light a £340,505 provision against
“obsolescence, long-service leave, de-
velopment, etc.” to which it added a
net £256,344 before arriving at net earn-
ings.
The bumper year was reflected in the
parent’s balance-sheet (consolidated
accounts aren’t available), not only by
the big increases in stock (up £467,311)
and book-debts (up £476,124), but also
by the fayt that these movements and

A. E. Goodwin, Ltd.
Thanks, mainly, to some fat contracts
for diesel-locomotives and an
accelerated rate of production, A. E.
Goodwin, Ltd., continued to move ahead
last term, the co., which delivered its first
Goodwin-Alco diesel little more than
three years ago, turning-out locos, at a
rate in excess of one a week in the latter
half of the year.
A. E. Goodwin has already collected
an order for 20 1000 h.p. locos, in the
current term and, as long as railway-
finances permit, there seems to be a good
chance of deriving further benefits from
the increased production-capacity.
Locos, are by no means Goodwins only
interest and, carrying-on a heavy-
engineering business established in 1926,
the co. manufactures an extensive range
of products, including coal-preparation
equipment (washers, crushers, dryers,
etc.), road-making machinery, gasholders,
floating-roof and other types of tankage,
cranes, powerhouse equipment and steel
ships and barges, as well as locos, and
rolling-stock. A sheet-metal division
produces domestic heaters, freezer-units,
hot-water services, etc., and further addi-
tions to the range of domestic-appliances
are planned.
Scrip to a par value of approximately
£250,000 was exchanged in the 1956 term

SI
Steel Works, Ltd., the co.
moving into Queensland last
year through the purchase of
the engineering- and foundry-
business of Scotts of Ipswich.
Goodwin's main - engineering-
works are on a leasehold pro-
perly at St. Marys (about 30
miles from Sydney, and on a
freehold site, still under de-
velopment, in the Sydney
suburb of Auburn. A small
shipyard and machine-shop is
located at Pt. Kembla. Had-
fields’ two plants are both in
Sydney while, as its name
implies, the newly-acquired
Queensland offshoot operates
at Ipswich, some 25 miles from
Brisbane.
Goodwins has made good
progress since it got over the
financial difficulties, -which
followed its reconversion to a
public co. in 1946, and has
gained some protection from
periodical slackness in the
heavy-engineering industry by
widening, considerably, the
scope of its activities. The
cost of developing the business
and the demands of an expand-
ing turnover (the ioco.-con-
tracts, particularly have tied-
up large sums in stocks) have
led to some big share-issues,
scrip being offered to share-
holders at par in 1950-51 (two-
for-one), 1951-52 (six-for-five),
1955-56 (one-for-two) and
again last month (one-for-four).
Holders of options issued last
term with £600,000 of 74- p.c.
notes participated in the latest
share-issue, which, when the
scrip is fully-paid, will give the
co. an ord. capital of £1,642,626
in ss. units. The new scrip is
at present paid to 2s. 6d. and
no date has been set, as yet,
for the final call. Pref. capital,
carrying a cumulative 5 p.c.,
amounts to £50,000.
After missing out for three
years, ord. shareholders came
back into the picture in 1951
to collect an 8 p.c. div., the
present, 10 p.c. scale coming
into force in 1954. Pref. divs
and 10 p.c. on an ord. capital
of £1.642,626 would absorb
£166,762, or £13,497 less than
last year’s net profit, the
highest yet turned-in by the
co.
While the manufacture of
locos, has made the biggest
contribution to turnover in the
last few years, the continuing
mechanisation of coal mines
and the expansion of oil-
refineries and bulk-petrol
depots have brought in some
substantial orders for coal-
machinery and tankage. How-
ever, apart from mentioning a
“considerable expansion in out-
put,” last'term’s accounts don’t
touch on the subject of group
turnover or its composition.
The visible improvement in
pre-tax earnings for the year
was only £2276 (to £267,809),
after allowing £29,377 for note-
interest and £44,692 (down
£5162) for depreciation, but a
big (54 p.c.) jump in stocks,
work-in-progress, etc., would,
no doubt, cover a large amount
of work on uncompleted con-
tracts, on which the bulk of
the profit would be taken into
account only on completion.
As claimed, net profit rose by
£14,026 to £180,259 covering
the pref. div. and 15.2 p.c. on
ord. capital, as against 14.1 p.c.
in the previous term, the gain
x being due, in part, to a lower
(and somewhat smallish) tax-
provision (down £11,750, at
£87,550):

A Great Medical Address
No. 155 Macquarie Street
By CATHERINE MacLAURIN
CHARLES NATHAN,
F.R.C.S.
Number 155 Macquarie
Street, one of the
pioneer medical houses
of Australia, at last
seems to have ended a notable
career which began in. 1847.
The old house has been sold,
apparently for demolition, for
the first time since Dr. Howard
Bullock bought it from the
estate of my grandfather, Sir
Normand MacLaurin, in 1914.
I am, in fact, the last survivor
of the MacLaurin family who
lived there in those legendary
days before the First World
War.
My father, Dr. Charles Mac-
Laurin, author of Post Mortem
and Mere Mortals, and a con-
stant contributor to The
Bulletin, was born there ; so
was my uncle, Brigadier-
General Henry Normand Mac-
Laurin, who died leading the
First Brigade at Gallipoli.
Number 155 has had but
three tenants in its 111 years
of life, for it was new when
my great - grandfather, Dr.
Charles Nathan, moved there ;
and it was on his death in
1872 that Sir Normand Mac-
Laurin bought it.
/Charles Nathan was the son
of Isaac Nathan, the first
musician to settle in Australia ;
Isaac was proud to have been
known as the friend of Byron,
through his setting of Byron’s
“Hebrew Melodies.”
Charles had newly graduated
M.D. from Westminster Hos-
pital when he came to Sydney
with his father in 1841, so that
he was very young when, in
1845, he was made one of two
honorary surgeons to the
Sydney Infirmary.
I believe that he was the first
doctor to hang his plate in
Macquarie Street.
-In 1847 he read in the
“Medical Review” an account
of the first operation performed
in England under ether, at his
old training-school, Westmin-
ster Hospital. What was good
enough for Westminster was
good enough for Charles
Nathan, so he copied the appa-
ratus used —an affair like a gas-
mask - and persuaded the
dentist Dr. Belisario to collab-
orate with him in the extrac-
tion of teeth under ether.
It was the first anaesthetic
to be used in Australia.
. Nathan’s neighbor in Mac-
quarie Street, and his intimate
friend,. was Charles Kemp,
editor of the “Herald,” who
secured permission to witness
the experiment, and confided
his impressions to his diary,
which survives in the Mitchell
Library:
It seems almost miraculbus that
by the inhalation of an impalpable
vapor a person should be entirely
free from the effects of pain, but
this is the case, as was evinced by
persons of various ages having teeth
taken'out, who were perfectly insen-
sible, and who, when they came-to,
would scarcely believe that they had
been operated on. Nathan deserves
great credit for having so speedily
availed himself of the slight infor-
mation which has yet reached us
from England.
Kemp followed this up with
a leader in the “Herald”
headed “The Ether Discovery,”
which brought down, a storm
on Nathan’s head. The
“Medical Journal of Australia”
immediately published a scath-
ing article called “The Ethereal
Humbug,” which triumphantly
concluded:
It may for a time serve interested
parties as a medium for puffing
themselves and for mystifying the
public by enveloping the subject
in a cloud of scientific balderdash.
We have no hesitation in predicting
for this process a transient popu-
larity ; it will have its day,
ultimately to be abandoned as use-
less or injurious.
Alas for prediction! It was
not long before the “Medical
Journal” changed its tune.
TVlathan was newly married
when he moved to Mac-
quarie Street. Harriet Fisher
was just sixteen, a sweet and
gentle maiden, who became
the affectionately submissive
wife of Victorian fiction. She
bore 15 children in her 30 years
of married life, and was the
first woman in Australia to
kpow the benefits of chloroform
i n childbirth, setting the fashion
in Sydney even before Queen
Victoria made such anaesthetic
fashionable in England,
My rooms today are-graced
by relics of Harriet Nathan’s
drawing-room in 155 Mac-
qUarie Street a feather-
picture ; a walnut table ; a
splendid Rockingham tea-set,
the delight of her descendants.

climb unaided “and a tall pair

and white, most beautifully

brightly polished they were
marked “Day” and “Night” in
black and red.
“Day” with a soft,
welcoming tintinnabulation, the
sound of which, after so many
years, yet lingers pleasantly
upon the ear.
Only when greatly daring
did a child ever venture to pull
“Night”; for it set up a
raucous clangor, lasting for
many seconds, and warranted
to drag the soundest-sleeping
doctor to the bedside of the
sick.
nPHE old house in Macquarie
Street was a most pleasant
place when Charles and
Harriet Nathan’s family was
growing-up.
It was quiet then ; no buses
drowned the cooing of the
pigeons in the Gardens oppo-
site. There were good schools
close at hand—Miss Flower’s
Academy for the girls, and
Sydney Grammar for the
boys ; and it was but a step
to old St. James’ Church on
Sunday morning.
There was much music in
the Nathan household, as be-
fitted the descendants of the
composer. When all the sons
and daughters assembled in
the drawing-room after dinner
they would play and sing, but
Father sang much better than
them all, the arias of Mozart
and Rossini. He was a jovial
companion, too, full of Vic-
torian jokes and puns, and
endless entertaining conversa-
tion. The young man who
came from England with his
father, as a rash venture, had
made a great success of life
in Sydney, and was well con-
tent.
Honors had come to him- as
years went on. In 1857 he
had been awarded an Hon-
orary Fellowship of the Royal
College of Surgeons “for the
excellence of his work and his
high reputation as a surgeon”
-—a particular distinction for
a colonial medico. On the
opening of the University of
Sydney he was appointed to
the first board of medical
examiners, and later was a
member of the University
Senate ; and he was the first
consulting surgeon to St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital. When he had
served 20 years on the stall
of the Infirmary he was
appointed the sole honorary
consulting-surgeon, with right
of tenure till his death.
He died the classic death of
the pre-antiseptic surgeon. In
1872 he scratched his finger
while operating on a “dirty”
case, and developed septi-
caemia; he was 56 years old
and at the height of his career.
His funeral procession was a
mile in length, and 70 private
carriages followed his coffin
from St. James’ Church in
King Street to the old New-
town cemetery where, eight
years before, his father had
been laid.
The private carriages held
the leading citizens of Sydney ;
but behind them trudged in a
long line hundreds of the men
and women who had been his
patients at the old Infirmary.
Many, said the “Evening
News;” were weeping, “be-
cause their generous friend and
comforter could minister to
them no more.”
HThe year before Nathan’s
death his daughter Eliza
married a Scots naval surgeon,
Dr. Henry Normand Mac-
Laurin, then visiting Sydney in
H.M.S. Challenger (he was not
the only officer who met his
matrimonial fate in the big
drawing-room of 155 Mac-
quarie Street, with its group of
pretty girls).
MacLaurin resigned his
commission in the Navy, and
settled in Parramatta with his
bride; but they were soon
back in Macquarie Street, tak-
ing Dr. Nathan’s place, and
there they spent the remainder
of their lives.
Sir Normand MacLaurin
became a leading figure, not
only in the medical world of
Sydney but in politics, finance
and intellectual life.
As a Minister in Sir George
Dibbs’s Government he con-
ceived the legislation which
mitigated the severity of the
bank-smash of 1893.
In the Federation campaign
he took an unpopular stand
when he opposed Federation,
on grounds of its excessive
financial complications. The
Bulletin made great play with
his involved financial speeches
and gloomy forecasts, and
regarded him as High Tory (in
the reproduced cartoon the
slate was for sums of costs).
Yet as the son of a poor
Scottish schoolmaster and the
descendant of Highland
crofters he held radical views
on land-tenure and taxation,
and opposed George Reid’s
Land and Income Tax Bill
because of its probable bad
effect on the small farmer, “the
backbone of the country.”
Sir Normand MacLaurin
found full scope for his
abilities as Chancellor of the
University of Sydney; there
he . spent himself without stint
and without reward.
Sir Normand MacLaurin walking to his car from 155
Macquarie Street, about 1907. -
Under him were built the
Medical School, the Peter
Nicol Russell School of
Engineering, and the Fisher
Library; he bought Challis
House out of the Challis
Bequest, a great investment for
the University.
I was brought-up to revere
him, and was properly shocked
when, in 1912, the . students
staged a demonstration outside
155 Macquare Street because
he had forbidden them their
procession, because of bad
behavior.
They came in cabs and taxis,
beating drums and blowing
horns, mocking the Chancel-
lor ; they sent a thousand
letters ' addressed to “The
Horrible Sir Normand Mac-
Laurin.”
I watched, a child sick with
shame and rage. But he was
magnanimous and just. He
forgave those who had pub-
licly insulted him, ignoring the
stern recommeddations of the
Proctorial Board. In the same
spirit he had refused to allow
Professor G. A. Wood, the
Liberal Professor of Modern
History, to be driven from his
Chair for having expressed
“pro-Boer” opinions during the
South African War ; yet he
himself detested Wood’s
opinions.
He died in August, 1914,
just as the Great War broke
out. He was 78 years old, still
in the fullness of his intellec-
tual powers. He had done a
great work for the University ;
he had lived through the
golden years of European
peace. He died surrounded by
his sons. Within a year his
pride and namesake, Henry
Normand, would fall in battle
on Gallipoli.
The last family gathering
was held in the old house when
Normand said good-bye ; none
foresaw his death on a wild
hillside in Asia Minor, of
which few of us had
heard. Already the great,
sombre dining-room, with its
family portraits, the narrow
hall, hung with prints of naval
battles, had about them the
faint, neglected look of pro-
perty about to be abandoned.
J gazed at the familiar rooms
in which for 67 years my
family had lived, striving to
preserve in memory their every
feature. I have never been
inside 155 Macquarie Street
since that sad day so long ago.

considerations, might be im-
proved in the current year if
the co. decides to mark the
fiftieth anniversary of its
founding with a bonus-div.
The three Kia-Ora offshoots
engaged in the manufacture of
canned - foods and soup,
cordials, sauces, etc., accounted
for approximately 80 p.c. of
the group’s income last term,
the balance coming from a
fourth offshoot which turns-
out corrugated- and solid-fibre
cartons, the bulk of which are
sold to outside customers. A
fifth operating-co., Lily Con-
tainers (Australia) Pty., was
added to the Kia-ora family at
the beginning of the current
term, the new co. being formed
to manufacture paper-cups and
food-containers under an
agreement with Lily Cup Corp.
of America.
Canning - operations, pre-
viously carried out in Mel-
bourne and Sydney, were trans-
ferred to the well-equipped
Bendigo (Vic.) cannery in 1956,
the container co. taking over
new plant and premises in the
same year in the Melbourne
suburb of Box Hill. Although
about three-quarters of total
sales and an even higher pro-
portion of profits are won in
local markets, the group has
built-up a considerable export
trade, mainly with the U-K.,
and is the largest Australian
exporter of tinned soup.
Food sales on the Australian
market rose by 9.9 p.c. over
the term to June 30 last, in the
face of what the board de-
scribes as the most competitive
conditions experienced in the
post-war years. However, this
gain was largely countered by
heavy selling-expenses and
“forced price-reductions” while,
in the U.K., intense competi-
tion from the local manufac-.
turers brought about a 14 p.c.’
cut in export-sales and, along
with higher expenses, appears
to have squeezed most of the
profit out of this side of the
business.
The container subsidiary-
reaped some benefit from a
14.5 p.c. lift in turnover, but
all told, the consolidated pre-
tax profit from trading tumbled
from £113,477 to ,£72,452,
after making a £13,963 larger
provision for depreciation
(£63,818), investments, bringing
in a further £16,186 (up £1648).
As a tax-provision of only
£14,000 (down £41,000) was
charged against earnings (a
similarly-disproportionate pro-
vision was made in 1956), the
board was able to write net
profit £1623 stronger at

At current rates of co -tax the

have called for a provision of
approximately £27,000 and the
extent (if any) to which pre-
vious, surplus provisions were
drawn on isn’t evident from the
balance-sheet.
As claimed, the net profit
represented 16.2 p.c. on ord'.
capital, after meeting pref.
commitments, compared with
15.7 p.c. in the preceding term
and 14.3, 14.3 and 13.6 p.c,
back to 1954.
Registered in Victoria as
0.T., Ltd., in 1909, Kia-Ora
Industries took its present
name in 1951 and followed-up
the change with one-for-one
bonus-issues to pref. and ord.
share holders. At the same
time the div.-rates on the
enlarged ord. and pref. capitals
were dropped from 10 p.c. to
74 p.c. and from 8 p.c. to 5
p.c., respectively, while a
further £175,000 of pref. money
was raised to give a total paid
capital of £600,000, including
£200,000 in prefs.
To ease the strain on work-
ing-capital arising from' an
expanding turnover and the
now more-or-less completed
programme of plant-replace-
ment and modernisation, the
parent co. borrowed £200,000
on 74 p.c. notes towards the
end of the 1957 term and last
year accepted term-deposits
amounting, at balance-date, to
£237,750. Although portion of
the deposit-money appears to
be of a short-term nature, the
whole is regarded as a deferred
liability in the balance-sheet,
and, on this basis, working-
capital rose by £184,353 to an
ample £732,105:

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
It will be surprising if N.Z.
gets through 1959 without
another burst of inflation.
During 1958 the consumers’/
price-inaex rose by 69 points,
or 6.5 per cent., to 1137. In
the final quarter of the year the
fate of increase slowed down
to only 7 points, or 0.6 per
cent., but it is very doubtful if
this improved stability can be
maintained.
Early in January the Dairy
Workers’ Union, by threaten-
ing strike action, got a sub-
stantial wage-rise. The public
service has also had a rise.
Now the waterside-workers
want another 9d. an hour. To
emphasise their claim they
stopped work in Auckland and
Wellington for two days. The
illegal strike, for that is what
it amounted to, came between
the breakdown of conciliation
proceedings and the hearing of
the dispute by the Waterfront
Industry Tribunal, fixed for
February 26.
Whatever the outcome of
the waterfront dispute, the big
question remains: What will
the Federation of Labor do?
It is expected to go to the
Arbitration Court fairly soon
seeking a general order increas-
ing wages all round.
If it does so, some increase
will probably be granted,
though the court is required by
law to consider not only the
cost-of-living but also the
economic welfare of the
country.
Inflationary Climate
There can be no doubt that
the economic welfare of the
country would not be served
by a general wage-increase at
present.
The tight rein which is being
kept on imports is, of course,
itself creating an . inflationary
climate. As stocks are liquid-
ated, demand will press more
heavily on the remaining
goods.
The Government is taxing at
an unprecedented rate and
should be able to show a dis-
inflationary surplus. But the
effect will not be as great as it
should be, because there is no
evidence of any real determina-
tion to hold State spending in
check.
In 1958, while it forced
private imports down by £2B
million, the Government in-
creased its own imports by
nearly £4 million directly, and
even by more if the goods
which are imported on its
behalf by private firm could
be taken into account.
Indicative of the Govern-
ment’s attitude are its plans
for a sharply accelerated pro-
gramme of State rental house-
construction. Last year 1500
units were built; this year’s
figure is to be 2200.
Savings Decline
Whatever surplus the Gov-
ernment does achieve will not
be entirely disinflationary. It
is pretty, plain that people have
been meeting increased taxes
not by spending less,, but by
running-down their savings.
As an indication of the
trend, small savings fell by
£8,200,000 to £373,500,000 in
the seven months to last
December.
The Post Office Savings
Bank, which is the largest sec-
tion of small savings, showed
a decrease of £1,400,000 for
nine months April-December,
1958, compared with a surplus
of deposits over withdrawals of
£13,400,000 for the same
period in 1957. (
How long this running-down
of savings will go on remains
to be seen. Probably for some
time yet.
A Post Office Savings Bank
cheque-account scheme for
non-commercial organisations,
incorporated societies and such
organisations as sports clubs
will come into force on
March 2.
The organisations concerned
will be able to keep their
money earning ordinary Post
Office interest rates (3 per cent,
on the first £lOOO and 2{ per
cent, on the balance up to
£7500), at the same time
operating on their accounts
with a cheque-book. It is
understood the Post Office also
intends to waive the stamp-
duty normally paid on cheques.
This is an obvious challenge
to the trading-banks, and it is
understood that they will
respond by offering the same
terms to the samq range of
organisations in an effort to
retain custom which might
otherwise go to the Post Office
Savings Bank.
For the first time the trading-
banks will be offering to pay
interest on certain current
accounts. They are also
expected to waive the 10s. a
year service-fee charged on
current accounts, and they will,
of course, have the advantage
of continuing to offer overdraft
facilities not obtainable at the
Post Office Savings Bank
Beer Figures
Though beer-consumption
fell steeply immediately after
the doubling of the beer-duty,
Customs figures indicate that
it has since picked-up to not
far short of normal. Human
nature being what it is, that
was to be expected.
The Government is reaping
a rich harvest, as the following
figures for total beer-duty
collections show:
£
First half, 1957 .. .. 3,245,069
Second half, 1957 3,586,170
7,831,239
First half, 1958 .. .. 3,421,174
Second half, 1958 .. 6,380,678
9,801,852
In gallons, consumption in
the second half of 1958 was
10.5 per cent, less than in the
second half of 1957.
Normally consumption rises
by about 4 per cent, over each
yearly period, so that, in fact,
the total for the second half
of 1958 appears to have been
about 14.5 per cent, less than
it would have been but for the
doubling of the duty.
This is a substantial fall;
but, as the decline Was known
to be very much greater in the
period immediately after the
Budget, it looks as if most
people are now enjoying close
to their usual quota of pints.
All very nice for the Govern-
ment! But the licensed trade
is far from happy.
Hotels in Trouble
Two of Dunedin’s leading
accommodation hotels would
have closed-down “but for the
patience of the merchants,”
according to the president of
the Licensed Victuallers’ Asso-
ciation of Otago.
He was commenting on a
report that 20 hotels were for
sale in Otago. “Every hotel
in the Otago district would be
for sale if it were at all pos-
sible to quit them,” he said.
On a 300-gallon tank of
beer costing the licensee
£146 7s. 9d. the Government
was getting in taxation £ll3
ss. 3d.
The proposal to. build a
tourist hotel in Auckland has
been abandoned, according to
Sir Ernest Davis, a director of
the Tourist Hotel Develop-
ment Company.
“It would be much easier,
in this satellite age, to obtain
capital to build a tourist hotel
on the moon than it would be
to do so in Auckland,” said
Sir Ernest. “There is nowhere
in the whole British Common-
wealth where such exacting,
unnecessary and restrictive
controls exist.
“Various overseas com-
panies sent their representa-
tives here,” he said. “Many
discussions were held but the
representatives all became gun-
shy when they found out the
state of affairs, and they all
wished us a polite good-bye.”
Tourist Hotel Development
(Auckland), Ltd., was formed
in August, 1956, to look into
the feasibility of building an
hotel.
The associated companies
are Pan-American Airways,
New Zealand Breweries, Ltd.,
and Dominion Breweries, Ltd.
TV Scare t
Alarmed by a report that a
New Zealand manufacturer
intended to produce some
thousands of TV-sets, • the
Government has issued an
instruction to all radio-manu-
facturers that they must noW
make individual application to
import television-tubes, which
formerly came in as electrical
vacuum-tubes.
Explaining the reason for
the Government’s action the
Minister in charge of broad-
casting, Mr. Boord, said it was
clear that a very undesirable
situation was developing.
“We might have seen many
thousands of TV-sets being
made in the country this year,
and if these could not be sold,
employment in the industry
might be jeopardised.
“On the other hand, by the
use of high-pressure salesman-
ship through retail channels
these sets could soon have been
in the hands of private
individuals.
“The presence of large
numbers of sets in the hands
of individual members of the
public without ample and
regular viewing facilities must
inevitably create strong pres-
sure for the early and prema-
ture introduction of the
service-pressure which the
Government wishes to avoid.”


Catch a Fish
By M. T. PEZET
Rtchard watched un-
happily as June and
Mr. Thomas swam in
the lagoon. He leaned
against a young palm, notic-
ing 'how June’s dark honey-
brown skin gleamed when she
rose and shook the water from
her face and hair. He also
noticed the way Mr. Thomas
watched her. He was swim-
ming and diving, and now and
them he'd playfully catch June
underwater, and she would rise
laughing and spluttering, her
white teeth gleaming in . the
sunshine.
It was an idyllic setting and
would have gladdened the heart
of a contented beholder. The
sky ranged from cerulean on
the horizon to a dense cobalt
overhead. Only a few flecks'of
white broke the vast depth of
blue. The water reflected the
sky in deeper tones. It was
a calm day, and only tiny waves
broke on the sweeping curve of
sand. The length of beach
was outlined with coconut-
palms whose leaves rustled
stiffly in the slight breeze. The
surf broke 100yds. out on the
the reef, with a roar 'and
tumble of white waters.
June was 17 now, and in
Richard’s opinion it was high
time she was married. He
would have asked her himself
by now if it hadn't been for
the untimely arrival- of Mr.
Thomas at their small Pacific
island. At the time it had
seemed a godsend.
The Australian mining com-
pany that sent Mr. Thomas
to the island in search of gold
paid well. Richard had had
a secondary education at the
Catholic school in Suva, and he
was very good at figures. He
had leave from the copra-
plantation where he worked,
and was engaged as Mr.
Thomas’s assistant while he
was prospecting on the island.
He thought that the wages he
was paid and his messing-
aliowance would enable him
to save enough to miarry
sooner than he had expected.
But, he thought miserably, if
he was any good at guessing
he wouldn’t be getting married.
Richard watched as Mr.
Thomas held June against him
briefly before they ran out of
the water, laughing and hold-
ing hands.
“Why didn't you stay in the
water, Richard?” June asked.
“L didn’t feel like it,” he
said.
They pronounced their
vowels very carefully, and
although they were brought-up
to speak English, to an Aus-
tralian like Thomas they
sounded as if they had just
learnt the language and had
to choose their words carefully.
There was no slurring of the
words, or running of one into
the other.
There’s no doubt about it,
thought Jack Thomas, these
half-caste girls are lovely. He
gazed openly at June’s full
figure. She looked about 20.
June saw him looking at her
and smiled. Richard’s unhappy
scowl deepened.
“What’s wrong, Richard?”
Thomas asked. “You don’t
lock pleased.”
"I’ve got a headache,” he
muttered, without looking up.
Why did this handsome
European come to their island
just when he thought June
was getting as fond of him as
he was pf her?
“Are you going to the dance
tomorrow night?” Thomas
asked Richard.
“I play in the orchestra,”
he replied. “I don’t get a
chance to dance.”
“Pity,” Thomas replied.
, “But then, that will leave June
free for me all evening, won’t
it? "Would you like to come
with me, June?” he asked.
“I’d love to,” June said.
Richard's scowl blackened.
He never asked June to come
with him. It' had always been
taken for granted she did,
even though he could not
dance with her during the
evening. And now she
accepted this Thomas’s invita-
tion. Of course, he could not
blame her. Thomas had money
to spend,- he was handsome,
and he had a way with women.
You didn’t need two eyes' in
your head to see that. And
June was a warm-blooded
.island
“Well, let’s go,” said
Thomas. “Work to do this
afternoon.”
The overtime money pleased
Richard at first, but not now.
He spent the, evenings on maps
and samples while Thomas
entertained June at the pictures
or strolled with her along the
beach, and, at supper at June’s
home, charmed the simple
island Euronesians who were
June's family.
HThat afternoon Thomas and
-*■ Richard covered a few
miles of hillside. Thomas
cursed the grass, which made
for hard walking and covered
outcrops. He had admired the
rolling grass-covered slopes
that looked so smooth, but he
found when he walked in it
that it was man-high and
piercingly rough.
Thomas became hotter as
the afternoon wore on, and
increasingly bad-tempered.
“I’ll be glad when we get
out of this grass!” he
said, as he wiped his brow
and pulled at the pieces that
stuck into his legs through the
thin socks. Soon after they
moved off again Thomas put
his foot into a mongoose-hole
hidden by the grass, and
.spr&wjed flat,. JJe sat where he
was on the ground and olirsed
at length.
Richard observed the change
in the handsome features and
thought June wouldn’t think so
much of the man if she could
see him at work. At least most
of the part-Europeans had the
easy good-nature of their
colored ancestors.
"Does it ever get cool here,
Richard?” Thomas asked him.
"Yes, about July,” Richard
replied.
"July! I won’t be here then
1 hope”; and he wiped his
brow again. His face was red
with the heat and bad-temper,
and he looked more his age.
“It’s cool on the water from
about four-o’clock,” Richard
said. “Would you like to go
fishing tomorrow afternoon? I
have a boat and we could spend
a couple of hours out. There’s
always a breeze then.”
“What about the dance to-
morrow night?” Thomas asked.
“And I hadipromised to take
June somewhere tomorrow
afternoon.'’
“Bring her fishjng,” Richard
replied. “She is used to coming
with me.”
“I think I will, thanks
Richard.” Thomas smiled.
“But we’ll be back in time
for the dance, won’t we?”

Playford Goes to the Polls
First of the three State elections
scheduled for March, the South
Australian poll will take place on
Saturday - week. Second - smallest
of Australian legislatures, the S.A. House
of Assembly has 39 members, compared
with 30 in the Tasmanian House and
94 in the N.S.W. Assembly, but eight
seats wiil be uncontested on March 7.
Government members with a walkover
include two Ministers —D. N. Brookman,
Minister for Agriculture, who represents
Alexandra, and C. S. Hincks, Minister
for Lands (Yorke Peninsula); others are
G. B. Bockelberg (Eyre), J. A. Heaslip
(Rocky River), W. W. Jenkins (Stirling),
C. L. Laucke (Barossa), and W. F. Nan-
kivell (Albert). The lastnamed goes into
Parliament without a campaign ; he won
the L.C.L. nomination for the seat on
the retirement of Sir Malcolm Mclntosh.
The only A.L.P. man returned unopposed
is C. D. Hutchens (Hindmarsh).
Including the above, L.C.L. is putting-
up candidates for 31 seats, Labor for
29, D.L.P. 15, Independents 12 and
Communists 5. Five women have nomi-
nated for Assembly seats and one of
them, Mrs. Joyce ..Steele, seems assured
of winning the safe L.C.L. seat Burnside
and of becoming South Australia’s first
woman M.L.A. Two women are among
the nominations for the Legislative Coun-
cil—Mrs. Geoffrey Cooper (L.C.L.) and
Mrs. M. J.. Scott (A.L.P.), both candi-
dates for Central District No. 2.
A feW days before nominations closed
the legal right of the returning-officer
to accept Council \ nominations from
women was challenged in the courts, it
being argued that the S.A. Acts which
gave women the vote did not entitle
them to sit in the Legislative Council.
To safeguard their interests in the event
of the ,challenge being' sustained, both
the L.C.L. and the#A.L.P. nominated
a third candidate (each Legislative Coun-
cil district returns two members). The
matter is stiil undecided, but it is rather
incongruous that after women have been
elected to both Houses of the Federal
Parliament and to most Australian State
legislatures their right should be chal-
lenged in South Australia, the first State
to give women the Vote.
Party Strengths
'"TPhe Playford Government’s control of
- 1 - the last Parliament depended on the
goodwill of two Independents P. H.
Quirke (Burra) and T. C. Stott (Ridley).
This apparently tenuous, grip on office
suggests that with a slight swing Labor
would have a good chance of victory
next week —but the grip is not quite so
tenuous as it seems at first glance. Tom
Playford has been Premier for over. 20
years, but his majority has never been
an overwhelming one—it could hardly
be that in a House of 39 members. There
have always been several Independents
in the Assembly—in 1938 there were 13
and more than once the Government
has had to rely on their support. Quirke
and Stott represent wheatgrowing dis-
tricts and both have a strong personal
following, but if they were to stand down
it is most unlikely that either electorate
would return a Labor member.
There has been little change in the
strengths of the two main parties over
the past fe>v years, but the changes that
have taken place have favored Labor.
Before the 1953 election the L.CiL. held
23 seats. Labor reduced the figure by
two on that occasion, but was unable
to make further inroads at the 1956
election—it gained Murray but lost
Wallaroo. At by-elections caused by the
death of sitting members during the last
Parliament it won back Wallaroo and
also gained Mt. Gambier, held for many
years by Independent John Fletcher.
Labor’s chances of winning the coming
election are based on hopes that this
trend will continue, but a survey of the
facts doesn’t encourage optimism.
As Labor would not be able to count
on the support of the Independents, it
would have to win four seats from the
L.C.L. before it could form a Govern-
ment —three if an Independent could be
persuaded to take the Speakership. And
among the 12 Government-held seats
that Labor is contesting there just don’t
appear to be three that offer much chance
of a swing. In fact, there doesn’t seem
to be one, and the D.L.P. intrusion
could send Murray, at any rate, back to
the Government. ;
Some Labor Promises
TVTonetheless, under veteran - Mick
' O'Halloran, who was first elected
to the Assembly in 1918 . and has been
there ever since, except for a six-year
break in the Senate, Labor is making
a valiant bid to shift the immovable
body , of Sir Thomas Playford from the
Treasury,-bench. In his policy-speech at
Peterborough, O’Halloran held out a
string of promises which, when the
limited resources of State Governments
are considered, made Dr. Evatt look like
a piker.
The list included three months’ long-
service leave after 10 years’ employment;
three weeks’ annual leave for everyone
and four for shiftworkers; equal-pay
for women; extension of free education
to University level; free school-books
and requisites ; decentralisation of in-
dustry ; co-ordination of road- and rail-
transport ; improved workers’-compensa-
tion benefits ; help for the aged ; appoint-
ment of a Minister for Housing;
mobilisation of building resources,
materials and men to solve the housing
problem ; electoral reform bne-vote,
one-value ; subdivision of large holdings
into “living-areas” for land-hungry young
men; restoration of c.-0.-l. wage-
adjustments ; Saturday-closing for
banks ; country meatworks.
The Labor leader made no attempt to
assess the cost of all or any of these
promises, and he gave no clue as to
where his Government would get the
extra revenue required to finance its
share. There was no mention of any
increase in taxes.
None of the foregoing was surprising
in a party-leader, long in the wilderness,
making a desperate bid for office. What
was astounding was to find a Labor
leader accusing a Liberal Premier, him-
self a man of the land, of favoring city
development at the expense of the
country. O’Halloran sees “unmistakable”
evidence of the Government’s design “to
extend even further the so-called metro-
politan area.” He accuses Playford of
concentrating industries and providing
housing with the object of attracting
population “and especially potential
Labor voters to areas already Labor
strongholds, such as the western and
northern suburbs of Adelaide and towns
like Port Pirie and Port Augusta.” The
South Australian electoral system is,
according to O’Halloran, the worst in
the British Commonwealth and its sole
purpose is to give the L.C.L. “a strangle-
hold on our Parliamentary institutions.”
A Fantastic Picture
Tt- cannot be denied that the S.A. elec-
total system is weighted in favor of
country electorates and that these return
mostly L.C.L. V members. It also cannot
be denied that under Playford his State
has had a period of unprecedented in-
dustrial development, most of it centred
on Adelaide or in the Pirie-Augusta-
Whyalla triangle at dhe top of Spencer’s
Gulf.' On- these facts O’Halloran has
built a fantastic picture of a Government
which favors the country against the
city in its electoral system so as to get
into power on . the country vote and
then favors the city electorates in eco-
nomic matters at the expense of the
country; which continues this policy
year after year and is still able to hold
the votes of the country people it has
neglected, yet is unable to attract the
votes of the city people it has favored.
Playford’s policy-speech didn't measure
up to his opponent’s in promises. There
was an undertaking to provide more
schools and Tibspitals ; to carry out a
programme of roadworks; to extend
the electricity network. These are routine
business rather than election-bait. So,
too, on the basis of past experience, are
the plans for the drainage of a large
area in the southeast of the State and
for the irrigation of land near the
N.S.W. border by means of a channel
from Lake Cawndilla, near Menindie
(N.S.W.), though what Mr. Cahill will
have to say about the latter remains to
be seen. The L.C.L, Government’s main
talking-point is that it has been accom-
plishing things for over 20 years, is still
getting things done and is planning
ahead. Like all Governments long in
office it asks to be judged on its achieve-
ments, but it doesn’t stand still on them.
Playford regards his past achievements
not as something finished, but as part of a
record that is still unfolding and on which
better things still are to be written


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM
Melbourne Racing
[Sad music very, very sad
music, please! > T o tips for the
main double at Caulfield last
Saturday appeared on this page
last week. For why? By odd
accident, the sheet in the Mel-
bourne man’s sheaf of copy which
had his tips on it somehow
attached itself to the bare cover-
sheet, was put aside with it, and
wasn’t discovered till a full day
too late. His selections were:
Oakleigh Plate: Gold Stakes, 1;
The Lampert, 2; Pride of
Colorado, 8.
St. George Stakes: L.ord, 1;
Prince Darius, 2; But Beautiful, 3.
So, unhonored —but not unwept—
he picked the double. If it is any
satisfaction to him, the sub. con-
cerned in the accident did not have
a razoo on either event. Out of old
racing superstition, he felt that if
he tried to profit by it he might
put the mock on the Melbourne
chap. What should really give the
Melbourne chap—and “Bulletin
readers—some compensating satis-
faction, though, is that his tips
were passed on in a letter to
friends at Concord Repatriation
Hospital. If they profited, they
deserved to —they deserve the best
that can happen to them out
there.l
For the fourth year in a
row a Sydney-trained horse
took the Oakleigh Plate when
Gold Stakes easily won this
year's running of the £4OOO
sprint at Caulfield last Satur-
day. From the moment he
jumped away well, to settle
down kindly in third place
behind New Spec, Gold Stakes
had the Plate won. New Spec
held his lead to the furlong-
post, but, whereas George
Moore was hard at work to
keep the Newtown Wonder
gelding going, Mel Schumacher,
on Gold Stakes, had only to
give his mount full rein to
dash past the leader and win
comfortably by a length and a
half. New Spec ran very well,
but he has not been lucky on
his Melbourne visits. Last year
he ran second in both the Oak-
leigh and the Newmarket.
Despite his 9.2, Gold Stakes
cut out the 5} furlongs in
1.4}, just outside the track and
Australian record of 1.3.9/10
set by both Dubbo and
Adelina in their Oakleigh
Plate wins of the last two years.
The bookies gave 9 to 2 Gold
Stakes, but at the finish he was
5 to 2. The Star Kingdom
gelding has now won nine races
from 14 starts, and earned
£9262 in stakemoney.
Any doubts that Lord is the
best middle-distance horse at
present racing in Australia
were settled at Caulfield, when
the big Targui gelding defeated
a field of the best w.-f.-a.
horses in the land in cavalier
fashion. Pitted against Lord
in the nine-furlongs St. George
Stakes were w.-f.-a. winners
Prince Darius, But Beautiful
and Wiggle, and the good colt
Sir Blink, but Lord strode to
the front at barrier-rise and
was never troubled to hold his
lead. At the finish, he had two
lengths to spare from Sir Blink,
who ran his best race this time
up.
Lord has a remarkable
record at Caulfield, his home-
track. He has won 11 times
there, and is undefeated in his
last eight races on that track.
In all, he has won 13 times
from 25 starts, to earn £16,775
"I give uppa da organ-grinding-now I catcha da fish."
stakemohey. Sydney racegoers
should see him next month
when he’s due to contest the
Chipping Norton Stakes at
Warwick Farm, and the All
Age Stakes at Randwick. Lord
is an ungainly animal, with a
marked tendency to hang out
around bends. It could be that
he will race more kindly the
Sydney way.
Many racegoers who went to
Caulfield intending to back
Hyleena must have been de-
terred by the good odds offered
against her winning the five-
furlongs Teppo Stakes for two-
year-old fillies. On form, she
looked a logical short-priced
favorite. The last time she
contested a similar event at
Caulfield —on Boxing Day —
she won very easily at 4 to 1
on. And here she was 4 to 1
against in the Teppo Stakes!
Apparently the bookies
thought she would be troubled
by her 9.5, but she not only
won comfortably, but her
59.7/10 took 2/10 sec. off the
track record. Alf Griffith,
who races the Nilo-Hyroanie
filly in partnership with his
wife, announced that Hyleena
would probably tackle the colts
in the set-weights Merson
Cooper Stakes at Caulfield
next Saturday, and if she runs
well she will get her chance in
the V.R.C.’s Sires’ Produce
Stakes next month.
Not for the first time in
recent years Melbourne race-
goers’ loyalty to their own
cost them dearly in the six-
furlongs Trenton Stakes for
two-year-old colts and geld-
ings at Caulfield. Although
the well - performed Sydney
youngsters Perouse and Travel
Boy were in the field, punters
sent the unbeaten Prince Lea
out a very short - priced
favorite. Prince Lea got a
dream rails-run at the turn,
but he could not get near
Perouse, the leader, and
weakened out of the placings.
It was left to Travel Boy to
chase Perouse unsuccessfully
to the line. It was a good
performance by the winner,
who started from 18 barrier
and ran the six in 1.11. He
may tackle next week’s Merson
Cooper Stakes before return-
ing to Sydney. Bred in Eng-
land, he is not eligible for the
Sires’ Produce Stakes.

Three weeks ago a comment
was made here on Red Pampas
and his fast-finishing sixth in
a Welter. It was suggested
that it would be a sad look >ut
for Red’s opponents the first
time he started in a jumping
race. The Black Pampas geld-
ing did not wait for the
jumping-season. Since that
comment was written he has
had two runs. He won a handi-
cap at Kyneton, and last
Saturday tackled a good-class
field in the mile-and-a-half
Bond Handicap, and put up a
first-class performance to win
narrowly. Undoubtedly his
owners, Mrs. F. Fair and P.
Grant Hay, hope to win the
Grand National Hurdle with
the gelding this year, but he
now looms as a definite chance
in the Australian Cup next
month. The Cup is not a hard
race to win, and in the Bond
Handicap Red Pampas de-
feated many fancied candi-
dates for the big race.
Until a few weeks ago only
those Melbourne racegoers
who keep an eye on country
form had heard of the three-
year-old Smokey Eyes gelding
Wheat King. Although he had
good country form, he was a
25-to-l chance when he won
the Chisholm Handicap at
Caulfield on January 31. He had
his first start since then in the
mile Manfred Stakes at Caul-
field last Saturday, and was
again at generous odds. He
showed that he is a galloper
to be taken very seriously by
bolting away from a field of
useful three-year-olds. From
15 barrier he took a while to
get into a handy position, but
in the run home he dashed
right away --a most im-
pressive performance. It was
yet another winning mount for
young Des Lake, who has
ridden four metropolitan
winners in as many weeks.
Main events at Caulfield next
Saturday, second day of the
V.A.T.C.’s autumn meeting,
will be the 7-furlongs Futurity


Stakes, carrying prizemoney of
£4OOO, plus a £250 Gold Cup,
and the £2500 Merson Cooper
Stakes over six furlongs, for
two-year-olds.
With its odd scale of
penalties and allowances, the
Futurity is one of the most
unusual races in Australia.
Although the weights range
from 10.6 down to 6.9, it is
usually won by a heavily-
weighted runner. Nine of the
last 20 winners have carried
more than lOst. It would be
hard to nominate a race that
has been won by more cham-
pions. Some of the winners:
Eurythmic, Gothic, Phar Lap,
Waltzing Lily, Ajax (three
times), High Caste, Bern-
borough, Attley and Royal
Gem. Whlliamson has ridden
four Futurity winners.
In recent years, four horses
have won the Futurity with
10.6, and that is the burden
Lord will carry next Saturday.
It is unlikely to stop him. The
danger could be Skyline, with
9.6, and possibly Vogel with
9.10.
In the Merson Cooper,
Sartorial Splendour, if he starts,
will be racing first-up from a
long spell. However, he is
very good, and may be fit
enough to win. Perouse and
Anonyme impressed last
Saturday, and both should
run well in the Merson Cooper.

Sydney Form
Fine And Dandy, top two-
year-old of the Australian
season, won his second succes-
sive race in open company
when, last Saturday, he de-
feated three-year-olds Jazz
Singer and Gabonia in the
Rosehill Flying Handicap. He
had won a similar race at that
track on January 31, narrowly
defeating Bold Pilot, one of
the best-fancied horses for the
Doncaster. The Star King-
dom gelding was toey before
the start, and didn’t get away
smartly. He had to be ridden
along to gain a good position
halfway through the race. In
the final half-furlong Fine
And Dandy was travelling
smoothly. It was a first-
class performance by a two-
year-old, and he’s now sef
for his most important task,
the Golden Slipper Stakes at
Rosehill next month. He
looks the winner. He has
started five times for a second
and four wins.
Two unplaced runners in the
Rosehill Flying put in such
fast finishes that racegoers will
be prepared for an early success
by both over a middle-distance.
They were the last Melbourne
Cup winner, Baystone, and the
last Doomben Cup winner,
Book Link. The last-named
hadn’t started since July, but
Baystone had had recent out-
ings in similar company at
Rosehill and had finished last
each time. Baystone finished
fifth to Fine and Dandy, and
Book Link seventh, in a field
of 20. As expected of stayers,
both were at the tail-end
shortly after the start, and they
were at cricket-score odds
Baystone at 250 to 1, and
Book Link 50 to 1. Both are
getting ready for the Sydney
Cup, in which Baystone has 9.3
and Book Link 9.2.
* * *
With the exception of Fine
And Dandy, and Perouse and
Travel Boy (first and second in
Caulfield’s Trenton Stakes),
most of Sydney’s best juveniles
sported silk in the Rosehill
Two-year-old Handicap. Front
Cover, winner of the Breeders’
Plate and second to Rum Issue
at Canterbury Park, was made
a warm favorite for the sprint,
and his defeat out of a place
was surprising. On the other
hand, the McCarten-trained
Noholme had an easy win.
This brother to Todman has
had three starts for two wins
and a second, and he looks like
keeping up the good work. He
will run in the Golden Slipper
Stakes. Tamberan (second to
Noholme) was uneasy in bet-
ting—however, he was beaten
on his merits, and ran right up
to form. Akimbo (third) re-
tained her consistency. She
has had two wins, a second and
a third from her last four
starts. She’s a class filly.
Ramazan’s display was below
expectations after his two
Randwick successes. Stanley
Wootton races Noholme.
Winner of eight races —five
from his last six starts —Irish
Folly is one of the most im-
proved gallopers racing on
Sydney tracks, and successive
wins over 10 furlongs at Rose-
hill have earned him a start in
the V.R.C. St. Leger at
Flemington on March 7. In
the Rosehill Handicap he
downed Lord Cortauld and
Lord Terrance. Trained at
Randwick by T. J. Smith, Irish
Folly is well up to weight for
the classic at Flemington ; he’s
in the Sydney Cup list with
only 7.11.

When Pompeii was sold at
the 1955 Randwick yearling-
auction for 2000gns. it was
expected he would prove a
worthy brother of Hydrogen,
but it was not until Saturday
at Rosehill that he won his
first race, the Second Parra-
matta Stakes (seven furlongs),
in which he appeared to have
a deal in reserve ; Doug Weir
sat easy in the saddle over the
final furlong. Pompeii, now
raced by Jack Denham, should
go on to better things. He is
a five-year-old gelding by
Delville Wood (imp.) from
Sweet Sound by Magpie (imp.).
On successive Saturdays
four-year-old Loquendi has
won restricted events at Rose-
hill ; he is still eligible for a
Graduation event. Racing in
blinkers evidently assisted in
his two wins.
The New Zealand invasion
continues, with the landing of

and last Saturday he won over
11 furlongs at Te Aroha.
Ark Royal, one of the favorites
for the Sydney Cup', is expected
from N.Z. on March 6. At
9.5 he appears to have his share
of weight in the Cup, but he
has won a number of races at

visit to Sydney. He won the
A.J.C. Members’ Handicap last
October.

Great Cheer proved him-

young pacers when he won the
final of the Youthful* Stakes,
for two-year-olds, at Harold
Park last Friday night. Favorite
at 5 to 4 on, he won by six
lengths from Skymain, who beat
Smooth Hanover three-quarters
of a length. Racing to the
front early, Great Cheer was
never headed, outclassing the
rest in record time of 2.10 f,
beating his own record, estab-
lished the previous Saturday.
Second-favorite Iwunda, who
was expected to extend Great
Cheer, broke his hobbles
shortly after the start and was
pulled-up. Friday's win was
Great Cheer’s sixth in seven
starts. His only loss was a
third in the final of the Goul-
burn Sapling Stakes after
breaking as they got away.

Peter May's Men
Peter May’s men started off
reasonably well. Though the
first two matches (against W.A
and the Combined XI in
Perth) were both drawn, the
team had good wins over
S.A. and Victoria. In its
second innings against W.A.
there was a collapse to 4-44
before Cowdrey and Bailey
held the side together—a col-
lapse engineered by the first of
the “throwers” encountered,
Keith Slater.
it was soon clear how weak
the opening-bats were, nor was
it long before England’s tail,
which rarely wagged, revealed
itself “five out all out” it
was, and those five batsmen
often went cheaply enough.
On the matter of “throw-
ing,” there are without doubt
quite a few bowlers in Aus-
tralian first-class cricket today
with jerky actions besides
Slater, there are Jim Burke,
Meckiff, the two S.A. pace-
bowlers Hitchcox and Trethe-
wey and, to some extent,
Rorke. lan Johnson had a
doubtful delivery ; so did Iron-
monger.
In all the criticism of
“throwers” one thing stands
out: no grumbles are heard if
the bowler is copping a lacing
- —it is only when he starts col-
lecting wickets cheaply that his
action is questioned.
In the M.C.C.’s first match
against Victoria Statham took

7-47 in the Vic. first innings
(six clean-bowled and one
1.b.w.). It was in Melbourne,
too, that Statham took 7-57 in
Australia’s first innings in the
second Test. Statham was the
best of England’s five pace-
men ; he only missed the last
Test through injury. Some
consider, too, that he bowled
better than did Tyson in Aus-
tralia in 1954-55, when Tyson
took the honors.
But, generally, England’s
batsmen and fieldsmen let it
down more than did its
bowlers.
The M.C.C. then played a
draw with N.S.W., after having
to follow-on 214 behind
N.S.W.’s first-innings score of
7-391. M.C.C.’s second-innings
began with an opening-partner-
ship of 170 (Richardson 87,
Milton 81), its only century-
start on the tour. N.S.W.’s
first innings featured a great
knock of 149 by Harvey and
a dull and dreary 104 by
Burke.
N.S.W. was led in this game
by Craig, who, not fully
recovered from illness, made a
duck (following a duck in a
Shield match), and then
dropped out of first-class)
cricket, withdrawing after hav-
ing been chosen to lead an
Australian XI against the
M.C.C. When the Ashes were
won, Australian skipper
Richie Benaud gave great
credit to Craig for his cap-
taincy in South Africa, and
for the part he had played
there in rebuilding Australia’s
Test-team. Craig is bound to
win his way back to big
cricket.
The Australian XI v. M.C.C.
match saw the M.C.C. domin-
ant. The Australian side, led
by Harvey, included six who
played in the Tests (Harvey,
McDonald, O’Neill, Kline,
Burge and Simpson), yet it was
ignominiously thrashed —dis-
missed for 128 and 103 ;
M.C.C. (319 and 3-257,
closed) winning by 345 runs.
May made 140 and 114.
Before the tour the M.C.C.
administrators claimed that
earlier tours were too strenu-
ous, and requested a reduction
in the number of games.
Accordingly, country centres in
various States (to their great
disappointment) lost their
accustomed games.
Long before the tour was
over, however, it had become
clear that the M.C.C. team
was the main loser —in lack of
match-practice for out-of-form
players. A batsman like
Richardson, for instance, had
to “play himself in” in the
Tests themselves.
• * • • •
The M.C.C. played some of
its cricket in heatwave condi-,
lions, particularly on its
return to Melbourne and
Adelaide for the second and
fourth Tests, and the return-
games with S.A. and Victoria.
(Despite which, the fast-
bowlers of both England and
Australia stood-up to the heat
well—Trueman, for instance,
5-46 off 18.5 overs against S.A.
in torrid weather.)
Whether or not the heat was
responsible, the M.C.C.’s visit
to Brisbane brought some of
the slowest batting ever seen
—in particular, of course,
Bailey’s 68 in 458 min. in Eng-
land’s second innings of the
first Test. But before that
“Don't snatch !”
there was Queensland’s 105
runs in a day against the
M.C.C. —27 runs in llOmins.
before lunch, 46 runs in
120 min. between lunch and tea,
and 32 runs in lOOmin. from
tea to stumps.
Shades of Macartney and
Trumper, and their centuries
before lunch!
And so to the fifth Test,
which went after the pattern
of the first, second and fourth
Tests. In those four victories
Australia won by eight wickets
twice, 10 wickets and nine
wickets. The first Test was
won with a day to spare, the
second and fifth almost two
days ahead of schedule.
One of the main features of
the fifth Test was Colin
McDonald’s 133 and 52 not-
out (out of 1-70), following his
170 in the fourth Test —
McDonald was leading run-
getter in the series.
Worth recalling, in view of
some recent yelping, that a few
years back McDonald had a
very bad “press,” particularly
in N.S.W.
Other features of play in the
final Test: the hard-hitting
partnership of 115 by Benaud
and Grout when runs were
needed ; good efforts by all the
Australian bowlers ; good
bowling-efforts by Trueman
and Laker; May’s double
failure, unusual for him ; nice
second - innings knocks by
Cowdrey and Graveney.
Touching on Lindwall’s
achievement, Ray Robinson, in
his Between Wickets, wrote
that “Of Lindwall’s 212 victims
in 55 Tests 98 were bowled,
133 were in the first six in the
batting-order and 60 were
opening - batsmen.” Of the
seven he has since taken, three
were opening-batsmen and six
were in the first six in the
batting-order—but only one
was bowled.

Highlights of the concluding
days of the Australian swim-
mi n g championships at
Hobart:
John Konrads became the fifth
swimmer to make a clean sweep
of the five Australian freestyle
titles. The last one to do so
was John Marshall, in 1949.
Konrads won two of the five, the
shortest (110yds.) and the longest
(1650yd5.), on the one day, last
Saturday.
A near-certainty for the four
longer races, his defeat in the
110yds. (in 55.95ec.) of John Devitt,
titleholder and world-record holder
for the distance, was rather un-
expected. It strongly emphasises
his all-round greatness as a free-
styler—such recent champions as
Jon Henricks and Murray Rose
were unable to compass the whole
range of distances as Konrads has.
It was left to Konrads’s sister
lisa to set the only world-record
at the championships—clipping
fsec. off her own time for the
880yds. freestyle. Her new time
is lOmin. 11.4 sec. Ilsa had also
won the 440yds. freestyle. The other
two women’s freestyle events
(110yds. and 220yds.) were both
won by Dawn Fraser, who swam
while still suffering the after-effects
of hepatitis. Dawn Fraser was
also a member of the winning S.A.
team in the 4-x-l 10yds. relay.
One or two other items of note:
Terry Gathercole won his sixth
successive 220yds. breaststroke title;
Ann Nelson, of Queensland, won
three titles (220yds. senior back-
stroke, 110yds. junior backstroke
and was a member of the team for
the 440yds. senior medley-relay);
Queenslander Rosemary Lassig also
had three wins (110yds. breaststroke,
220yds. breaststroke and the medley-
relay) ; American girl Sylvia
Ruuska’s two wins (220yds. medley
and 110yds. butterlly) and her com-
patriot Chris Von Saltza’s one
(110yds. women’s backstroke);
promising S.A. junior Dale Krieg's
two women’s junior freestyle wins;
and 16-year-old Queenslander John
Rigby’s very good seconds (behind
Konrads, of course) in the 440yds.
and 1650yds. freestyle events, and
his third in the 220yds.
Victorians, men and women,
dominated the diving events. Only
one title, for the men’s high-tower
diving, was won by a diver from
another State —in this case, Barry
Holmes (N.S.W.).


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE KRUPP EMPIRE
HThe decision of the Krupp
coal and steel combine to
take-over the Bochumer Verein,
a major Ruhr steel company,
focused world attention on the
continuing size and power of
the Krupp industrial empire
and caused some papers to
wonder what has happened to
that part of the 1945 Potsdam
agreement which committed
the Allies to “eliminate present
excessive concentration of eco-
nomic power” in Germany.
In 1953 Alfried Krupp
signed an agreement with the
occupation forces of ' West
Germany to sell within five or,
at most, seven years a major
part of his coal and steel
interests, and,he is reported to
have complied with it to the
extent of selling about £ 12-
million-worth of property. “But
in the meantime,” notes “Man-
chester Guardian,” “he has
started to expand his steel
interests, while another fib-
million-worth of his posses-
sions, due to be sold under the
1953 agreement, still remain
on his hands. By a curious
combination of circumstances
no purchasers can be found in
Germany. Even more curiously,
some of the properties sold by
Herr Krupp are ultimately
discovered to have been sold
to himself or to friendly
industrialists who will help
him in their reacquisition.
“All this has aroused suspi-
cion outside Germany, where it
is rightly held that such con-
centration of economic power
is politically dangerous. Inside
Germany these suspicions can
easily be misrepresented as the
envy of economic rivals —
particularly to the people of
the Ruhr, who look upon
Krupps as good employers and
who generally incline to the
view that what is good for
Krupps is good for them, even
though it did not turn out to
be quite so good last time.
“Lord Lansdowne rightly
insisted that the whole question
is a matter for the three Powers
and the Federal [Bonn]
Government. Perhaps they
will now decide to look at it
once more. But what can they
do? Herr Krupp has relied on
the healing effect of time, and
he seems to have proved right.”
Writing on the same subject
in Edinburgh “Scotsman,”
Sebastian Haffner remarks that
the 1953 selling-order, apart
from its legal complications, is
in practice a dead-letter —“The
occupation authorities which
once imposed it and might have
enforced it no longer exist.”
In fact, Haffner claims, the
whole industrial-deconcentra-
tion policy was of doubtful
value, because it did not take
account of the demand, made
London “Daily Express.”
“BUT THIS ONE WILL!”
by modern mass-production
techniques, for “big produc-
tion-units closely co-ordinated.”
Such empires exist in “every
modern industrial society
whether capitalist or Socialist,”
and some of those in Russia
and East Germany “surpass in
concentrated economic power
anything found in the capitalist
world.”
As for anxiety about Krupp’s
future activities, Haffner
reports that Krupp has volun-
tarily “gone out of the arma-
ments business altogether,” and
that he has even “rejected
advances from both the Bonn
Defence Ministry and some
other Nato Powers, including,
it is said, the Americans.”
Also commenting on future
possibilities, Arthur J. Olsen,
in “N.Y. Times,” claims that
“the tenacious Ruhr industri-
alists have not turned the clock
back 20 years.” They are, he
says, subject to the European
Coal and Steel Community,
which, though not opposed to
bigness as such, “is committed
to fight the abuses of bigness.”
He points also to the restraints
afforded by the Bonn Govern-
ment’s anti-cartel law and the
“co-determination law,” which
gives labor “a voice in com-
pany policy-making.”
Integration in Virginia
"Dritish and U.S. editorial
** comment on the peaceful
admission, on February 2, of
21 Negro students to seven
previously all - white public
schools in Virginia (U.S.A.):
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“For five years Virginia has
struggled to avoid complying
with the Supreme Court’s
decision that State and local
laws requiring racial segrega-
tion in the schools are uncon-
stitutional. But unlike some of
its sister States farther south
it has scrupulously limited its
struggle to ‘every legal means.’
Federal and State court rulings
which would enable it to main-
tain segregated education have
been sought and time and time
again refused. Therefore, loyal
to its Governor’s pledge to
abide the law, the historic
leader of the Confederate
States accepted the inevitable.”
The same: “This does not
mean that the struggle for
integration has been finally
won, either in Virginia itself or
in the South at large. Far
from it. All it means is that
Virginia has agreed to accept
the Supreme Court’s ruling to
open State schools to Negro
children. This will not prevent
the authorities from doing
everything legally possible to
build up a private system of
education based on public
funds which will in fact cir-
cumvent the spirit, although
not the letter, of the Supreme
Court’s ruling. Whether this
endeavor will prove practicable
is open to question. The cost
could hardly fail to jeopardise
the State’s educational
standards generally.”
* * p
“New York Times” : “This is
only the beginning. Patience
and tolerance are virtues which,
ironically enough, are en-
couraged by education. Negro
children in the South will have
a harder time to gain accept-
ance in previously all-white
schools in those parts of the
South where the schools, for
lack of money, have not been
good. Arlington is a long way
from the Gulf of Mexico, and
Norfolk is a long way from
the Mississippi River. Progress
will be slow, but what
happened on Feb. 2 —or what
did not happen—arouses new
hope that there will be progress
and that this nation may come
nearer to the ideals expressed
by a Virginian named Thomas
Jefferson and a Kentuckian
named Abraham Lincoln.”

school for the children of its
servicemen if the State did not
do its duty. More significant
still, an influential group of
Norfolk citizens—among them
leading businessmen came
out with a statement that,
although they disliked integra-
tion, they disliked having to
do without public schools even
more.
“There are other parts of
the State where resistance is
unlikely to peter-out so quickly
or so painlessly. But after
February 2 the South, which
needs Virginia as a figurehead,
no longer looks so solid.
Virginia has made a start: this
should be known in places
where the only Southern town
people can readily name is
Little Rock.*’
♦ * *
New York ‘‘Herald Tri-
bune” : “Virginia's ‘massive
resistance' laws, invalidated
last month in both State and
Federal courts, have been an
abomination to integrationists,
an embarrassment to Southern
moderates, an inspiration to
last-ditch segregationists. The
school openings marked their
final, inglorious defeat."
The same : “There has been,
and still is, massive bitterness
in Virginia, bitterness directed
against the North, against the
Supreme Court, against the
Negroes. The integrated open-
ing of schools in Norfolk and
Arlington will not wash away
this bitterness. But the way
has at last been opened for
Virginia's return to the Union.
The rule of law has been up-
held, and the recognition of
equal rights as a part of the
nation's fundamental law has
been honored. This, in itself, is
a major milestone. To Virginia,
we say ‘welcome.’ The home
of Presidents, the cradle of
our liberties, is once more a
part of the mainstream of
America.”
in the sand and refused to
recognise that things have
changed and some producers
on marginal land are having a
very tough time of it. Last
May it discussed proposals for
a reserve-price authority, but
decided that it preferred to
have the auction method of
marketing wool untramelled by
price-support measures. It
recalled that, when it took a
referendum on the subject in
August, 1951, nearly 64,000
growers were against floor-
prices and only 10,300 were in
favor. Probably if a vote were
taken today the proportions
would be much different from
that. But one could not
assume that a majority would
now support a. Common wealth
reserve-price plan. The main
body of support is in Western

“SUGAR, SIR?”
Australia, although, the idea is
finding greater acceptance in
all States.
“The opponents of the
scheme contend now, as they
did then, that floor-prices don’t
work. If they are fixed too
high (they say), there is a
danger that during a recession
so much wool would have to
be boughl-in that the stocks
held back would eventually
depress the market further. If
the support prices are too low,
they are not much use to the
grower.
“Two other arguments which
carried weight in the 1951 de-
bate were, first, that the
scheme would involve Govern-
ment control of the industry,
which no one wanted in any
degree, and, second, that
artificial measures to keep up
the price of wool would only
serve to open the door wider
to the man-made fibres. If the
consumer thought that wool
prices were being ‘rigged,’ he
would turn to the synthetics,
and this would be the worst
possible consequence for the
growers.
“Some of these arguments
have lost their force in recent
years. After seeing the New
Zealand and South African
schemes in action many more
Australian growers are taking
second thoughts, and it would
be enlightening to have another
ballot to see how matters now
stand. Recently, Mr. F. S.
Arthur, London agent of the
New Zealand Wool Commis-
sion, commented on the irony
of a situation in which his
organisation’s reserve prices
were holding up the value of
Australian crossbreds, while the
low level of Merino prices in
Australia had made the com-
mission buy-in New Zealand
Merinos and halfbreds. There
could be no better example of
the need for all three countries
to work together in this all-
important field of commodity-
price protection.”
U.K. Emigration
Tn the course of an article
analysing U.K. emigration
figures for 1958 which
dropped sharply from the
1957 peak—a London “Finan-
cial Times” correspondent
notes that “it is clear that the
U.S. and Canada claim a far
higher proportion of trained
U.K. scientists and engineers
than any other country”:
“The Australian Immigra-
tion Bureau, on the contrary,
judges that a fair proportion
of its adopted citizens come
from the artisan class. The
future of migrants’ children,
it claims, is the major reason
for changing country, and this
is borne out by the fact that
82 per cent, of the migrants
arrive in Australia en famille.
The number of people moving
from the U.K. to Australia has
been increasing slowly over the
past few years—it is one of
the few countries to resist the
current anti-immigration trend.
About 50,000 people annually
have been leaving for Australia,
but it is thought that the figure
for the /year ending June,
1959, may be as high as
60,000. The Immigration
Bureau claims further that the
percentage returning to the
U.K. for all reasons is only
6 per cent.
“One Commonwealth Emi-
gration Bureau, at least, states
that the flow of applications
can be carefully regulated
according to the amount of
advertising done, although it is
probably necessary to have
about 300,000 inquiries in
order to select 35,000 immi-
grants.”
Arkansas Turbine
Tender
'"The U.S. Government's rejec-
tion of the English Electric
Company’s tender for supply
of turbines for the Greer's
Ferry dam-project in Arkansas
—though the tender conformed
with requirements of the Buy
American Act and was
£106,000 less than that of the
American firm whose tender
was accepted brought some
lively editorial comment in
both the U.S. and the U.K.
A few samples:
London “Daily Mail” :
“Britain has received many
homilies from Washington
about liberalising trade and has
taken them seriously. She
recently freed American
machinery from import-licence
restrictions. She has also
bought implements worth
£8 million from the very firm
who pulled the rug from under
English Electric. Which is
galling. No wonder our
Government has protested
strongly. Sir David Eccles is
right when he says the rejec-
tion of this tender is hardly
consistent with the idea of
interdependence and freedom
of trade.
“That interdependence, we
would add, is not confined to
our two countries. It is
becoming more important, and
increasingly evident, through-
out the world. The days are
gone when Britain was almost
the only big exporter of capital.
Now America is by far the
biggest, but others, including
Russia, Germany, and even
China, are joining in. Britain
knew that if her customers
were to be able to buy her
goods they must be encouraged
to earn a living. It is a lesson
the U.S. sometimes seems in
danger of forgetting.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph ” .
“In spite of Mr. Dulles’s
reassurances, all the evidence
suggests that the Administra-
tion reached its decision on
political grounds. Last Novem-
ber, when the Republican candi-
date for the Senate was running
into serious trouble over un-
employment, he assured the
voters that this particular
contract, which represents
207,000 man-hours of employ-
ment, would go to an American
firm. Unlike the great majority
of other States, Arkansas
returned a Republican.
“But indignation ignores the
intense political difficulties
which any Administration
has to face over free
trade. It also ignores the
extent to which in the past the
strategy of withdrawing a yard
has enabled President Eisen-
hower to advance a mile at a
later date. He has repeatedly
used the intense ill-will created
abroad by one specific act of
economic reaction notably
the rejection of English
Electric’s bid for the Chief
Joseph dam in 1953 as a
successful argument for head-
ing-off far more generalised
attacks against free trade.”
The same : “The truth is that
the [U.S.] Administration is at
present under very severe
pressure to restrict imports of
all kinds of heavy electrical
goods on security grounds. The


Office of Civil and Defence
Mobilisation is expected to
rule on this issue in the fairly
near future. There can be little
doubt that the intense outcry
in Britain, and also in the
American Congress and press,
at this illiberal decision, could
help the to
resist the generalised demand.
If it does, this isolated setback
will have been a relatively small
price to pay. On the other
hand, if the Administration
gives way on the general as
well as the particular it will
herald a major switch in Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s economic
philosophy.”
* * *
“New York Times”: “The
issue, under the law, is whether
or not the national security is
endangered by imports of
foreign equipment. Special
application is made to areas in
which there is heavy unemploy-
ment. Sir Harold Caccia, the
British Ambassador, has pro-
tested over what seems to be
the practice of inviting outside
bids and then rejecting them.
Sir Harold finds it hard to
believe ‘that the entire national
security of the United States
will be imperilled if two
turbines were built by her ally,
Britain.
“It is evident that the Buy
American Act is one way of
raising the protective tariff a
l’ttle higher. It is also one way
of making it harder for the
British and other allies to get
dollar exchange here which
they might use to buy
American goods. In these
matters of international trade
we usually hurt ourselves when
we hurt our friends. And, of
course, the taxpayer pays the
bill.”
Martin on
White Australia
TV'ot long back in England
after his Dyason lecture-
tour of this country, editor
Kingsley Martin, in London
“New Statesman,” remarks
that “the future of Australia is
intimately connected with the
racial problem”:
“That the exclusion of
Asians as such is un-Christian
and offensive to Australians
has been stated in plain terms
by ministers of many religious
denominations. As a moral
principle, White Australia is
not tenable; as one leading
professor put it to me, ‘It is
like sin: we all know it is
wrong, but we enjoy it.’ There
are two methods under discus-
sion by which the traditional
policy might be modified.
“The first, supported in
general terms by many leading
men, including the Minister for
External Affairs, is the accep-
tance of Asian quotas after the
pattern of the United States
immigration laws. Those who
advocate this method usually
assume that the quotas would
be small; they usually hope
to escape the taint of discrimi-
nation against Asian countries
without changing the Aus-
tralian way of life, risking
racial mixture or undermining
Australia’s wage standards.
Australian Labor, which has
always taken the strongest
stand against Asian immigra-
tion, will need a great deal of
reassurance on this last point.
Moreover, it is doubtful
whether the institution of a
quota might not cause more
offence to Asian countries than
the present blanket refusal.
“The second method of
modifying the present policy
would be for Australia to
accept individual Asians on
their merits. Just as Mr. Cal-
well changed the face of Aus-
tralia by accepting immigrants
from Europe without changing
the law, so a future Minister
of Immigration might bring
about a greater revolution by
accepting Asian immigrants—
London “Daily Express.”
“HA! ANY BOURGEOIS MATERIALISM YOU CAN DO, I CAN DO BETTER!”
in so far as public opinion
permitted.
“There are now two com-
ments I would like to make.
The first is that Sir MacFarlane
Burnet spoke for all who think
scientifically when he told the
Australian Citizenship Con-
vention that Australians must
rid themselves of the idea that
all intermixture with colored
people was necessarily bad.
This was an unusual sentiment
to be publicly expressed in
Australia, but it was obviously
the truth. In the long-run it is
impossible to maintain little
white enclaves in the modern
world. Sooner or later all races
will mix. There will be neither
white nor black.
“Secondly, the application of
this principle, to Australia or
anywhere else, is seldom simple
or easy. No one has any idea
whether a large number of
Asians would wish to come to
Australia if the doors were
open; and Australians are
perfectly justified in seeking to
safeguard their living-standards.
Asian countries themselves do
not accept indiscriminate immi-
gration.
“The central question on
which this and all other Aus-
tralian issues depend in the
long-run is whether Australia is
to be developed as a great
modern country or not. Except
in areas where prospectors
have found new sources of
wealth under the soil, there is at
present little incentive to
development in the vast, almost
uninhabited, desert or semi-
desert areas. But Australians
are all aware of the change in
their position. They have been
a small technically advanced
people neighboring on Asia
but not a part of it; today they
watch with embarrassment the
rest of Asia also becoming
technically advanced. Can
they alone leave their country
undeveloped?
“Professor Oliphant has told
them that with the help of
atomic energy their desert
lands may become rich and
ready for massive development.
The possibilities unknown,
but if capital is applied to the
large-scale developments of
Australia, the 20 million to
which they now look forward
as their maximum population
would be incalculably in-
creased. In that case the doors
could not remain closed to
Asians. Probably the best hope
for Australians is that, realis-
ing in time that they cannot
remain isolated and under-
populated, they will embark on
( a policy of controlled develop-
ment in which they will accept
the co-operation of their Asian
neighbors.”
Global Poison
A larmed by the announced
discovery in Britain of
“botulinus toxin” —a biological
substance, Boz. of which, it is
claimed, could wipe out all life
on earth London “News
Chronicle” remarks that it
“shares one attribute with the
H-bomb. It is so frightful that
it is almost impossible to
believe that any nation would
resort to it. But it differs from
the H-bomb in being cheap to
make. Lack of resources need
prevent no country from using
it for blackmail”:
“The lesson of this grim
news is simple, .and not new.
The world has got to come to
its senses, not for the benefit
of Russia, America, France,
Britain or anyone else. But for
survival.
“Science is outstripping the
human imagination. Science,
which is so successfully taming
evil, must itself be tamed. The
Soviet peasant and the Wall
Street banker can surely, now,
be impelled by a common
resolve.”
A little more sceptical,
“Manchester Guardian” ob-
serves that in spite of the
toxin’s undoubted power it
“has a number of practical dis-
advantages” :
“The most relevant is the
difficulty of administering the
appropriate dose. To do this
in the hurry of war would
entail the spraying of probably
millions of tons —not merely
tens of ounces of material.
Even the resources of the rival
Air Forces would be outrun.
For this reason the interest of
biological militarists is prin-
cipally concentrated on the use
of bacteria and viruses which
can multiply themselves while
living on human populations 5
rather than on the infertile
distillates which may be
obtained from them.”


“Oh, in plenty of time. I
play the guitar in the band,
and I must be back by half-
past-six for my kana and bath.
1 must be at the hall by eight-
o’clock.”
“That should be fine, then,”
Thomas said. “I’m looking
forward to taking June to the
dance. I think I should do
all right for myself.”
Richard’s face flushed
angrily.
Thomas laughed. “Now,
now, Richard. Don’t look like
that. You’re just sorry you
didn’t take the chance when
you had it. You can’t blame
me for hoping. June is a very
beautiful girl ; and she’s look-
ing for it.”
A fter work, instead of going
straight to his lodgings,
Richard waited outside the
store where June worked, and
walked home with her. He
attempted to hold hands with
her, but she laughingly with-
drew.
“June,” Richard said, “I
want to talk to you.”
“Well, what is it, Richard?
We’re nearly home.”
Richard stopped, and June
waited impatiently.
“I’ve been able to save quite
a bit of money with this job.
The company pays well.”
“I know, and I’m pleased for
you, Richard.”
“I’ll be able to get married
on what I save.”
“That should be very nice
for you and some lucky girl.”
“June, stop pretending that
you don’t know what I mean.
I want you to marry me,
straight away if you like.”
“Why, Richard, you don’t
mean that.”
“I do. You know, I’ve been
wanting to ask you for a long
time. And I think it is time
you were married.”
“Surely I know when that
is better than you do,” June
said, exaggerating her annoy-
ance to hide her embarrass-
ment. It was true she knew
Richard had long* wanted to
marry her, and she would have
accepted him, before Thomas
came to the island. But now
she knew how much she would
miss by marrying anqther half-
caste.
“I don’t like the way Mr.
Thomas looks at you,”
Richard said.
“Well, I do,” June replied.
“At least he’s a man who
knows how to show his appre-
ciation.”
“Some appreciation,”
Richard scowled. “And don’t
think you’ll trick him into
marrying you, because you
won’t. He’s not the marrying
kind. Besides, he’s too old for
you.”
The last was called in a
raised voice because June had
turned from him and was
walking up the path to her
house.
Richard shrugged and
walked moodily ‘home.
Saturday was a beautiful
day. Richard said little as
he and Thomas traversed the
hills, Richard carrying the tape
and carefully writing the labels
for the sample-bags.
Thomas’s bad-temper of the
previous day returned. Again
Richard thought ; what a
different man June would see
when he was dressed up in his
white mess-jacket and red
sash. He’s a handsome devil
when he is not in a temper, he
thought moodily, and he knows
it. Just waiting to show him-
self off in his fancy clothes
when I have to wear a sulu
in the band.
The day dragged for
/-Richard, and he was waiting
long before four-o’clock at the
stone steps leading into the
water at the side of the wharf.
They arrived soon after four,
hand-in-hand. Richard helped
June into the boat and let
Thomas scramble in clumsily,
rocking the boat.
Richard steered straight for
his favorite fishing spot. When
they were some distance from
the wharf, he put out a spinner
and trolling-line for Thomas,
who sat in the stern with him,
at the other side of the motor.
Thomas gave a shout when the
line lifted slightly from the
water. He began winding it
in. The nylon line went close
to the exhaust, then pulled
away again.'
Richard put his hand out to
pull the line away from
it, but suddenly remember-
ing Thomas’s mottled angry
face when things annoyed him,
he pretended not to notice the
line and to be attending to the
motor.
Just as Thomas shouted,
“It’s a big one!” the line went
limp, lying lightly on the
water, with just a short piece
left for him to wind in. He
clenched his teeth, but the out-
burst of annoyance that
Richard was hoping would
come didn’t show itself.
Instead, he turned sharply
to Richard and said: “How do
you like that! It must have
been too heavy for the line.”
Richard made no comment,
but attached another hook and
spinner, and Thomas threw out
again. He soon had another
bite, but as he hauled in at the
same angle, the thin nylon ran
over the exhaust and snapped
again.
“Damn it! ” exclaimed
Thomas, his face flushed. But
he kept his temper, merely
observing to June that his luck
seemed to be out.
June looked quizzically at
Richard. Richard wasn’t a
spiteful fellow, and abandoned
hope of showing Thomas up
after letting him break his line
twice. Thomas was obviously
determined to be polite while
June was in the boat.
“It must be burning on the
exhaust,” Richard said. “Here,
“You re dead lucky—my hubby's just got back
from the bank."
try your luck over the side
of the boat.”
Thomas had no more bites,
and soon Richard anchored. A
gentle swell lifted the boat
slightly, and there was the
soothing slap-slap, of the
water against the boat. They
sat without talking, and had
caught only a few small fish
when Thomas looked at his
watch.
“Time to turn back,” he said.
As he spoke, Richard hauled
in his line with a small fish
on it. Then there was a splash
and a loud thud as a large
ongo jumped into the boat and
threshed around.
“Look out!” Richard yelled.
June gave a little scream and
jumped back.
As the ongo arched its back
and threshed near
Thomas’s leg, Thomas fell back
against the motor, and that
rocked free of its fastenings
and disappeared over the stern.
“ it!” Thomas said,
looking over the side. _ He
didn’t fancy rowing miles back
to the island.
“Mr. Thomas!” Richard
remonstrated.
“Never mind Jack’s lan-
guage,” June yelled. “Get rid
of this ongo before it takes
a piece out of my leg!”
13 ichard grabbed a bag, and
as the fierce fish leaped
at the side of the boat, he
helped it over. It landed with
a splash and the boat rocked
crazily.
Then they leaned over the
stern of the boat and gazed
at the motor, just discernible
in 15ft. of water.
“We were lucky to be over
such a shallow spot,” Richard
observed.
He took a rope and let it
over the side. He held one
end and Thomas the other.
They managed to hook it
under the engine and began
To haul it up slowly. It fell off
when it was just a few feet off
the sea-bed. Again they tried,
and the same thing happened.
“Well, it looks as if one of
us will have To go down for
it,” Richard said.
“Don't look at me,
Richard-4” Thomas said. “I’m
not going to swim in company.
You’ve told me there are lots
of sharks and ongos around
here. It’s getting late. Can’t
you leave a marker and come
back and get it tomorrow?”
Richard and June exchanged
glances. Obviously, Thomas
not only was ignorant of how
much these motors cost, but
he thought that part-Euro-
peans, who were expected to
have the same living-standards

to smell (real Harris-tweed, as
worn by “tweedy” sorts). In
those far-off days when
Colonials were real Colonials,
and Wogs were real Wogs—
Harris-tweed had a distinctive
smell. It was a smell of the
harness - room compounded
with a strong whiff of peat. A
real he-man smell pulsing with
masculinity. And it was all the
result of the way they used to
dye the cloth with natural
dyes—redolent of ye banks and
braes.
Well now, let the squatters
be up and doing! Let them
get some of the research-
scientists on the job of patting
Australian wool on the nose!
The scientists can work out a
scheme a process that will
give the manufactured wool,
in the cloth, a real Australian
smell —guaranteed to make the
wearer smell like a real Aus-
tralian male!
If that sounds too tough for
the ultra-fastidious, then let us
have cloth which will provide
us with sports-jackets impreg-
nated with eau-de-Cunnamulla,
or sports-trousers (bodgie-lined)
soused in aqua Goondiwindi.
It will have to be backed-
up, of course, by some first-
class on-the-nose press-propa-
ganda which will give both
amorous youth and glamor-
seeking age the idea that there
are plenty of datees waiting to
be dated —if only the would-
be dators can keep on smelling
like real Australians.
Then, friends, Romeos and
countrymen, the price of wool
will cease to drop, and the
cosmeteers, because of this
skilful counter - propaganda,
will be deprived of our none-
too-spare cash.
as Europeans, were always paid
at the rate that Thomas’s
company was paying Richard.
“I’m going over for it,”
Richard said. “You .watch for
the big fish.”
He dived over the side in his
shorts, and soon put the
engine in a rope-sling. He
guided it up as the others
hauled in the rope. Seated in
the boat again he sorrowfully,
took it apart.
“Don’t you think we’d better
start rowing?” Thomas asked.
“Row?” Richard said.
“Row? I’m taking this motor
to pieces right now and dry-
ing it.” .
“But dammit man, I’ve
promised to take June to the
dance tonight.”
“I’m not going to ruin the
motor for a dance,” Richard
said. “Besides, it doesn’t make
any difference. Even if we
started rowing, we would never
get back in time for the
dance.”
“And why not? Blast it, I
was looking forward to tonight.
So were you June, weren’t
you?” Thomas was losing his
temper rapidly. His face was
unpleasantly mottled and he
was shouting.
“Why can’t you look after
your blasted boat properly?
You half-caste ——s are
all the same. You’re as incom-
petent as the damn’ niggers'.”
“I’m a half-caste, too, Mr.
Thomas,” June said.
She had dropped the
intimate “Jack” and her voice
was icy.
“I’m sorry' June, I didn't
mean that,” Thomas said. His
apology was for June only,
and his voice still had a good
deal of asperity in it.
“You should apologise to
Richard, too,” she said.
“I’m damned if I will,” he
half-shouted. “Why the hell
can’t you put your engine on
properly?”
“The- pivoting pin broke
when you fell against it,”
Richard said. “It was nothing
1 could help. Anyway, I’ll get
the motor going again. It
looks like a good night’s fish-
ing,” he grinned cheerfully to -
June. “And I’m afraid there’ll
be nothing to eat, Mr. Thomas,
unless you like oily bread and
raw fish.” Richard smiled as
he rubbed the butter from the
sandwiches he always carried
out fishing, onto the motor-
parts.
“Why can’t we go back
now?” Thomas asked.
“I’ll show you in half-an-
hour’s time,” Richard said.
“You’ll be able to see the reef
quite clearly then.”
T}or six hours they sat in
the boat. June and
Richard fished, but at first
caught little. Thomas sat
morosely, saying nothing.
When the wind rose and the
waves rocked the little boat,
his occasional bad-tempered
remarks changed to agonised
groans over. the side. In a
remarkably short time, June
and Richard were hauling in
fish. Mr. Thomas was provid-
ing good burley.
When the tide had risen
enough for them to cross the
reef, they motored back. The
engine rocked crazily, tied to
the stern with rope, but it got
them there. As soon as they
pulled into the wharf steps,
Thomas jumped out and
offered June his hand.
She said “I’ll help Richard,
thank you, Mr. Thomas.”
With a surly “Good-night
then,” he strode off.
June turned to Richard. The
wharf, was dark, but she could
feel him standing beside her.
She pulled his head down to
her, and whispered into his
ear, “I’m, sorry I was such a
fool, Richard,” and kissed his
ear lightly.
“I Should say, I’m sorry you
missed the dance, but I’m not,”
he said.
And for a long time they
held each other in the dark and
said nothing.
THE STEAM-TRAM
If a dream can start the steam-tram, where the beggar
used to whine r *'
At the corner near the hoardings about “P.C. Forty-nine,”
Spitting steam around its pistons, blowing smoke out
of its stack,
As the fares blow smoke and spit from the compartment
at the back,
I’ll make the trip down Hunter Street, past Wickham,
dredging still,
Through Hamilton and Islington, up shanty-built Tighes ’
Hill,
Where, round the bend, a little way altmg the Maitland
Road,
The grocery, the butchery and the old sweetshop stood.
It’s a short walk from the tram-car, left verily in the lurch,
Up past the kindergarten, the tennis-court and church,
And against the farther hillside, with thp river-flats beyond,
I’ll find a wooden cottage in its hard-worked bit of ground:
A lawn of which my father said it never seemed to stop —-
It was time to start the bottom when he’d mown it to
the top —
And a pepper-tree full of beetles, and. a little silky dog
And, on a fence of sweet-peas, a somnolent green frog.
i
There’ll be butterflies and chrysanthemums, and snowdrops
near the hedge,
And petals of a huge white rose flaked on the grass’s edge,
And violets and snapdragons, that bloom together when
They share the single season that will never come again.
Then it’s only up a flight of steps, and a knocking at the
door:
Will the ghosts be disconcerted ? Will my welcome still be
sure ?
They are only dust and ashes; they can well survive the
shock —
What have I to. be afraid of ?' Go up, you fool, and knock.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Science and Religion
Many people will agree with
“Jas. Macansh's” views on the
relationship between science
and the Christian church (B.
21 /1 / ’59), but some will
question his statement that
“with the spread of education
in non-Christian countries the
old religions will break-down ;
and with them will go the
traditional sanctions and social
codes.”
Why should a religion such
as Buddhism, for example,
“break-down” before the
advance of education? Along
with Hinduism, it has taught
two now-fashionable scientific
theories (laws of evolution and
causation) for several mil-
Jeniums, while prominent
Western thinkers admit that the
Buddha’s psychology was sur-
prisingly modern.
As for Buddhist ethics, they
are scarcely distinguishable
from Christian ones. Indeed,
when Buddhism was first
studied in the West, some
people claimed that it was
merely a copy of the teachings
of Christ; this, of course,
before it had been definitely
established that Buddhism was
the older religion by some
centuries.
Apart from Buddhism’s
insistence on morality, unsel-
fishness, non-resistance and the
getting of wisdom, its main
plank has always been the
necessity of gaining enlighten-
ment. What can “enlighten-
ment” signify but the first-hand
knowledge of reality or “truth”
of which “Jas. Macansh”
writes? Far from breaking-
down, Buddhism today is
flourishing and may, perhaps,
already be again what it was
formerly the world’s 'pre-
dominant religion. It includes a
number of erstwhile Christians
(Westerners) among its con-
verts.
In four important non-
Christian religions—Hinduism,
Buddhism, Islam, Judaism
there are strong reformist
movements. Two outstanding
“Something must be done, Georgius, to abate this smog nuisance !”
Hindu reformist organisa-
tions are the Arya and Bramo
Samaj, both of which are work-
ing to break-down the caste
system (which is dying a slow
natural death, anyway) to
abolish temple sacrifices, to
rid the temples of images and
sacred pictures and to open
them to all regardless of
creed, caste, race or color —
who are sincere worshippers of
the fact behind phenomena.
Rabindranath Tagore, the poet-
philosopher, was a moving
spirit in the Bramo Samaj.
In Japan, though State
Shinto is the official religion,
-Buddhism has been the faith
of the majority since the seventh
or eighth century. There,
most of the latter-day reforms
have been on the surface: no-
body wished to alter the funda-
mentals. Interested in the
methods employed by
Christians, some of the sects
have opened new temples in
cities so that they may be as
accessible to people as are the
Christian churches. Services
have taken on a more “con-
gregational” character and are
held regularly- on Sundays,
while in a number of temples
belonging to the Shinsu sect
Buddhist hymns are sung to
well-known Christian hymn-
tunes. They have introduced
pipe-organs and even surpliced
choirs’! From what 1 have
gathered from friends who
recently toured the country,
there is no. falling-off of
attendances at the The
same may be said of Thailand
—though, of course, there is
a world of difference between
the intellectual content of
Japanese and Thai Buddhism.
The “57 varie t i e s of
Christianity” are unlikely to
upset either Hindu or Buddhist.
There are thousands of Hindu
sects; and Buddhism, too, has
quite a few. What is puzzling
to the Eastern mind is that
some Christian sects (not all
deserve the accusation) are
intolerant of fellow-Christians
who don’t entirely share their
views.
In my opinion, the spread of
education throughout the East
is likely to lead to greater
reforms within the ancient
religions there, but will not
necessarily draw many people
to Christianity. Education
possibly poses identical
problems for Christian and
non-Christian. Granted that
attendances at Hindu temples
and Moslem mosques aren’t
what they used to be ; but lots
of Christian churches aren’t
-exactly packed either— Maitri
(N.S.W.).
Public Service Growth
Remembering our national
leaning towards the Welfare
State, the steady growth of the
public service in numbers and
influence can hardly be con-
sidered surprising.
The cause of this unhealthy
trend lies in the demand for
social-services from cradle to
grave, and the willingness of
political parties to try to
provide them. Offered “bene-
fits” apply to nearly all classes
in nearly all circumstances of
life ; so the pay-off, naturally,
is mass support, a vote to
office —and a mounting army
of civil servants to administer
the handouts.
Politicians with no special
training, appointed to ad-
minister departments, must rely
increasingly for guidance and
decisions on their trained and
permanent departmental heads.
With more services (and there-
fore more staff), senior servants
are forced to delegate authority,
thus adding to an already long
chain. The result is that senior
or competent public servants
acquire a power that is, to say
the least, challenging.
It is undeniable, of course,
that the skilled, long-trained


and necessary public servant
does a good job worthily and
is vital to. the conduct of
essential public services. But
while ever we “let the Govern-
ment do it,” we’ll have no cause
for complaint if this means
more and more unnecessary
civil servants. Doing it our-
selves, by way of decentralisa-
tion in political and economic
life, by distributing ownership
more widely and by accepting
more personal responsibility,
has a more hopeful future.—
Xavier (Vic.).
Wool Problems
Suggestions to abandon
open auctions, introduce a
floor price, etc., to ensure’ a
better return to woolgrowers
completely overlook the possi-
bility of wool being priced
out of the market. A leading
store recently charged 275. 6d.
for a pair of short woollen
underpants and 545. 6d. for a
singlet. Similar garments of
cotton and/or synthetic fibres
were at various prices less than
10s.
Obviously, most people will
buy the cheaper articles. It is
true the bulk of our wook is
exported, but woollen goods
are far too expensive through-
out the world. Graziers’
organisations should sponsor
a complete investigation into
the cost-structure from the
sheep’s back to the shop-
counter. If growers imagine
they can obtain higher prices
by increasing the cost to the
consumer they are kidding
themselves and speeding the
search for better substitutes.

I
High Costs of the A.B.C.
Don’t know how the A.B.C.
could effect big economies (B.
28/1/’59), but a start might be
made by pruning some of the
fees paid to civil servants for
broadcasts which are part of
the work they’re already being
paid to do.
A lot of the A.B.C.’s air-
time is taken-up with rural
broadcasts ; rural matters are
commonly mentioned in other
talks-programmes; and the
Government officers contribut-
ing are paid script and broad-
casting fees. Scripts are usually
either recorded or broadcast
during normal office hours, so
presumably the officers are
given time off for this purpose.
This would suggest that the
departmental bosses consider
that, in broadcasting, the
officers are doing a worth-
while job, and I’d say
they are in fact, broad-
casting probably makes their
jobs easier and their work
more effective. If there’s an
outbreak of codling-moth in a
district, and it’s imperative that
there should be no movement
of fruit from that district, then
a broadcast from a national
station gets the news around
quicker than any ’ other
method; but if’s part of
the Agricultural Department's
duties to ,make those facts
known as soon as possible, and
the officer who does the broad-
casting shouldn’t be paid a
fee for it.— -Pieter Nuyts
(W.A.).
Teaching the Rudiments
I agree with “Orion”
(B. 28 /1 / ’59) and the retiring
Sydney professor who com-
plains of falling educa-
tional standards and university
students who cannot spell. I
have three children at school
—primary and secondary—and
I am often disturbed by their
general lack of appreciation of
art, poetry and literature.
Certainly, they seem to learn
a great deal at an earlier age
than my generation did, and
they have a wider variety of
interests than we had. But the
foundations are not so firm
and dependable. For instance,
the modern way of teaching
reading is by the “see and say”
method. Both my youngsters
simply memorised their readers
and gabbled them off by heart.
Faced with new words, they
were at a complete loss. Con-
sequently, their reading and
spelling suffered to such an
extent that this year I intend
to do some tutoring on old-
fashioned lines.
The lass at secondary school
has only a slight knowledge of
the great names in art, poetry
and literature, • and a very
sketchy idea of Australian
history, customs and literary
figures. She is keen on art, but
dislikes the crude colors and
abstract ideas of most of her
art-teachers.
Perhaps the fault lies in over-
large classes and the conse-
quent lack of individual atten-
tion and discipline. Or maybe
it is the result of an over-
crowded curriculum • and the
emphasis on sport. The greatest
trouble probably stems from
the general tendency to lower
standards in all walks of life ;
and the blame for that must
rest on adult shoulders —
Cynice (Vic.).

Faith in the
Future
With the possible exception of roads, the
Australian problem that seems to me to call
most for concerted national action now is the-
management of our water resources.
And by that I mean all departments of water
control: the mitigation of drought, the lowering of
flood risk, the conserving of run-offs.
Want of water is not peculiar to this country.
It is the main factor in limitingffand production all
over the world.
America, through which I travelled recently,
has its long droughts in some States, its destructive
floods in others.
But there are distinctions between the United
States and Australia, as relating to the question
of water. About one-third of Australia has a
rainfall lower than twenty inches. In any case, the
rich and diverse American economy is able to take
the impact of floods and droughts far more easily
than we can.
Much is being done —some of it brilliantly—
in tackling major aspects of the water problem
for us here.
Works ranging from the giant Snowy River
scheme to local dams and weirs have been
undertaken. The Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation has helped greatly
with its progress in aerial rain-making and in the
minimising of evaporation.
The Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology
is making a special survey to establish principles
that can be applied hydrologically over wide areas,
and for long periods.
These and similar activities are being
supplemented by work the States are doing in
various ways.
But all these excellent efforts, taken in whole,
still do not constitute a national plan; certainly not
one of the concentration and magnitude which I
see Australia’s expansion demanding.
A practical proof 6f our Faith in Australia
will be how firmly we face that reality now, and
how soon we marshal our able forces in an all-out
national drive for the provision and control
of water.
H. Hastings Deening


(B. 11/2/’59) is really very
simple. Since everyone on any
school teaching-staff has
“done” these subjects, it is
assumed that anyone can teach
them. So anyone usually does
teach them. An additional
reason, as regards English
expression, is that it is allotted
about half-an-hour weekly, all
told, on any school timetable.
In secondary schools most of
the English periods are con-
sumed with Shakspeare (for the
exam.) and Shelley, Keats, and
co. (for the exam.).
Another factor inimical to
clear expression in English is
the essay. A boy taking the
Senior English paper in
Queensland has a choice of five
subjects for his essay. Here is
an average five taken from
recent Queensland Senior
English papers:
Teach these boys nothing but
facts. • Facts alone are wanted in
life.
The abolition of examinations.
Young people are not what they
used to be.»
Has sport any value, or is it a
waste of time?
Juvenile delinquency—cause* and
cure.
Normally, the boy (aged
16-18) has about half-an-hour
to write about \lOOO words on
one of those subjects. Could
you do it? Who could —in
clear English ? No wonder the
examiners nowadays have
printed on top of the essay
section: “The examiners will
refuse to read slovenly, ill-
written, careless work.” —

Glen Innes Railway
The • Inverell-Glen Innes
(N.S.W.) railway-project must
hold some sort of record for
Government promises deferred.
Newspaper reports in 1891
stated that agitation had
already been going on for 20
_ years!
The plan originally was to
continue the line beyond Glen
Innes to give the north and
north-west of N.S.W. an out-
let through the thriving port of
Grafton. When the main
northern line pushed up to
Glen Innes in. 1893, and was
extended to become the only
Brisbane - Sydney rail - link,
hopes were high that at least
- the 45-mile portion, so often
surveyed, between Inverell and
Glen Innes would be con-
structed.
Came Federation, and in
1902 Inverell got its rail-con-
nection—-not 45 miles eastward
to the main northern line, but
90 miles westward to the
Moree terminus. Thus this ex-
panding town, 416 miles by
road from Sydney, is 509 miles
by rail almost as far as
Bourke.
Hope for the Glen Innes
link lingered on; in 1922 an
optimistic editor wrote that
“prospects were never
brighter,” and the agitation was
renewed at intervals till after
World War 11. Though many
official excuses were made,
none mentioned the fact that
Glen Innes, 422 miles from
Sydney, is less than 300 miles
from Brisbane, and trade
tends to flow north across the
border rather than south to
Sydney.
Fighters for better communi-
cations are now concentrating
on the completion of the new
Glen Innes-Grafton highway
and the deep-sea port at Iluka.
The railway, it is feared, will
have to await the formation of
the longed-for New State. —

The Run on the Bank
George Beesley (B.
17/ 12/’5B) challenges my state-
ment that there was a serious
run on the Commonwealth
Savings Bank in Sydney after
Lang’s bank had closed its
doors on April 22, 1931 ; and
to show that 1 am mistaken
he quotes figures . indicating
that in 1930-31 the C.S.B.'s
excess of withdrawals over
deposits was not abnormal.
Here are some of the major
developments leading up to the
two bank crises in Sydney:
As our export prices con-
tinued to fall the depression
deepened, with unemployment
mounting alarmingly.
Ip this situation the N. S.
Wales Government (which
meant J. T. Lang) implemented
part of the notorious “Lang
Plan.” Early in April, 1931,
N. S. Wales refused tp pay
interest due on a London loan.

been withdrawn earlier from
the Government Savings Bank

of N.S.W., much of it pre-
sumably by people out of yvork,
the Lang Government’s act of
repudiation really started the
run on the bank. Within three
weeks some £4 million was
withdrawn ; resources were at
an end and the bank closed,
never to reopen as a State bank.
All this is related to the run
which was made not long after-
wards on the Commonwealth
Savings Bank. As was officially
indicated later, most of the
“panic money” withdrawn
from the State bank went to
the C.S.B. ; there was, in fact,
no other N.S.W. savings-bank
in which to put it.
About this time E. G. Theo-
dore, Treasurer in the Sculhn
Labor Government, introduced
in the Reps, a number of bank-
ing and currency bills. One of
these provided for the aboli-
tion of the existing 25 per cent,
gold-reserve against the note-
issue and empowered the
Treasurer to commandeer and
export, if necessary, the whole
of that reserve to meet com-
mitments overseas.
The public (and the banks)
were at that time much more
gold-minded than they are to-
day. Although Theodore’s biff
was rejected by the Senate,
many people feared that it was
only a matter of time before
the gold-reserve would be
whittled away and Australia's
already financial
posit - 'on would become chaotic.
So. understandably but illogi-
caliy, a run on the C.S.B.
began. Depositors did not
stop to think that the Com-
monwealth Government and
the Commonwealth Bank,
unlike Lang, had a printing-
press which, if the run became
prolonged, could have 'been
used to print additional notes
until the panic ended.
The run lasted about a week,
and how many million pounds
were paid out in that time only
the bank officials knew.
Plainly something had to be
done, and promptly. Sir Robert
Gibson, chairman of the Com-
monwealth Bank Board, made
a broadcast in which, among
other things, he said that he
knew of no safer place for
people to put their money than
the C. 5.8., that the rumors that
it would close were ridiculous,
and that anyone!who wanted
to take their money out could
easily do so. This ended the
run.
Now, according to Mr.
Beesley this could not have
happened: the thousands of
depositors who created the
second-biggest banking crisis
since the turn of the century—
even Sir Robert Gibson himself
-—all were victims of their own
imagination.
Actually, the explanation of
the figures George Beesley
quotes is simple. It is pretty
certain that when the depositors
had recovered from their panic
they realised that they could
not leave large sums of money
in the old tin-box indefinitely;
they had to find a safe place.
It is also pretty certain that
most of the money withdrawn
during that hectic week came
back to the Commonwealth
Bank, probably within a few
weeks. .Therefore, percentages
of withdrawals in relation to.
deposits for the whole financial
year would be relatively un-

affected by the crisis.—J. D.

Fashions ih Cars
Social scientists, say that
people today are too ready to
conform, that they prefer the
feeling of group security to that
of being an individual. Whether
this is generally true or not,
you haven’t much chance of
escaping conformity when it
comes to buying a motor-car.
v In the first place, there’s no
longer the range of makes that
there was, say, 30 years ago.
At this year’s Perth Motor
Show there were only 21 car-
manufacturers represented
some, of course, with a variety
of models—whereas in 1922, in
England alone, there were 96
separate companies producing
cars. By 1950 there were only
32 English makers, of whom
six supplied 90 per cent, of the
market. Today, in Australia,
Holdens supply half the
market; and when Ford and
Volkswagen each complete
their multi-million building-
programmes aimed at the all-
Australian-car market, the field
will be narrowed further.
Nor are the designs as dis-
tinctive as they were. Compare
the old VB, Austin and Whippet
with three equivalent models
today and note how much
more the current models
resemble each other.
Of course, some of the
diversity of earlier decades was
due to the wider age-range of
the cars in any given district.
Few factories turned-out new
models each year; for one
thing, buyers didn’t have the
dough, and cars in those days
were built to last. So owners
hung on to their cars -for much
longer than they do now.
In fact, you used to be able
to recognise a man. by his car,
but now it’s practically im-
possible to .tell Smith from
Jones until he can see the
whites of your eyes. It’s no
wonder that youngsters go for

And More Wool
Though most of what
“O.D.W.”' (B. 4/2/’59) says is
true, why does he blame tke
grower? His first complaint is
about the high price of woollen
garments. Last year the
average price of wool wa£
around 56d. per lb. What does
“O.D.W.’s” jacket weigh?
Two to three pounds, pro-
bably and not all of
that is wool. Say it con-
tains 51b. of raw wool, of
which 50 per cent, was lost
in scouring and combing. The
grower probably got about
255. for it. Give or take 10s.,
he would receive only a small
fraction of the “15 to 30gns.”
Nor is the grower to blame
if manufacturers use reclaimed
yarn instead of new wool; for
this obviously takes away part
of his market. And it is not
the grower who decides to
manufacture garments from
wool better suited for blankets
or carpets.
It is true that a small
minority of growers, through
ignorance or indifference, con-
tinue to produce poor-quality
wool, but most are sufficiently
businesslike to strive to pro-
duce the best possible under
the conditions of soil, climate,
etc., prevailing in their area.
That plenty of suitable raw
material is available for the
large-scale manufacture of
high-quality garments was
demonstrated during both
world wars, and a few firms
stiff manage to turn them out.
It’s also worth repeating that
only Australia produces the
superfine wools used in the
rightly publicised wardrobe of
the wife of the chairman of the
International Wool Secretariat.
Unfortunately, the growing of
this beautiful stuff .(high-priced
too, but a few ounces make a
dress) demands conditions
which are found only in certain
relatively small areas. —

PROBLEMS OF THE DAIRY-INDUSTRY
[From R. A. PRICE]
'T'his seems the season for
items in the press finding
fault with the dairy-industry.
Consumers protest against the
h gh price and poor quality of
dairy-products,, especially of
milk sold in the cities. Pro-
ducers. are worried about
rising costs, falling demand, the
collapse of export-prices, low
net-returns, competition by
cheap substitutes, and the clash
of conflicting interests within
the industry itself. “Why
doesn’t the Government do
something about it?” is the
cry from every quarter.
Most of the troubles do not.
call for further technical pro-
gress. They are political—
matters for central organisa-
tion, reconciliation of rival
demands and overall planning
with nation-wide aims. The
situation is so complicated that
few people are qualified or
willing to pronounce on what
should be our aims and by
what means we should try' to
attain them,

decide on a common policy ;
when consumers are confused

when the best technical experts
are still exploring every avenue

room for the industry to ex-
pand efficiently, it is under-
standable that Governments
should be reluctant to commit
themselves and should defer
decisions in the hope of'getting
more light on the subject.
There are more consumers’
votes to be lost or won than
there are producers’ votes, but
consumers could be antagon-
ised just as surely by the
destruction of the dairy-
industry and the consequent
shortage of vital milk-products
as by .apparent favoring of
producers at the expense of the
wives and families of the
workers.
In the days of free enter-
prise, when there was com-
petition and the laws of supply
and demand operated on a
free market, farmers’ butter
could be bought cheaply in
the shops and every town and
suburb had its own dairy.
Suburban dairies, however,
were often far from hygienic,
and the free market often left
the consumers with too little at
too high a price.
Therefore, controls were
placed on the industry—for the
benefit of consumers as much
as for producers. To ensure
pure and nourishing dairy-
products there have to be
checks on quality, licensing of
producers and inspection of
farms, factories and shops.
Farms must conform to high
standards of equipment and
buildings and use methods
approved for clean milk-
production.
For a farmer to enter and
remain in an industry which
imposes so many conditions
and controls, there must be
adequate inducements, and
there must be a fair guarantee
of security. If he is not able
to build up reserves against
natural setbacks, or if his
living is at the mercy of
political whims and fancies he
would be far better off doing
something else.
In that event the country
would be short of dairy-
products, for home consump-
tion and export. No person in
the nation would find this state
of affairs agreeable. It is one
which any Government must
guard against, since one of the
main functions of government
is to guard against shortage of
food. Therefore, the price has
to be paid by those who want
the food. There is no such thing
as cheap food without the
exploitation of someone or
other—either the people who
grow and gather it or future
generations whose resources
will be so much the poorer if
we despoil them now.
Security and stability are
necessary in the dairy-industry
because its products are
essential to the health of the
nation and because its activities
and processes are necessarily of
such long range.
A dairyfarmer uses buildings
and equipment which are
expensive and at the same time
unsuitable for any other use.
His farm is often too hilly for
any crop but grass, and too
small for the more extensive
raising of sheep or beef-cattle.
The skills and knowledge a
dairyman acquires through a
lifetime in his profession are
not lightly to be discarded in
a switch to something else, and
not easily to be resumed when
dairynien are wanted again.
Nor can a bunch of raw
recruits be built quickly into a
community with the cohesion
and the joint capacity do sur-
vive and flourish which is
possessed by an established
group of dairyfarmers.
There is, however, un-
doubtedly room for improve-
ment. The fact that costs of
production on farms vary as
much as 300 per cent, indicates
big possibilities for reduction
in costs. If some of the
resources now devoted to
politcal bickering were to be
applied to making more readily
available the information
necessary to improve dairying
there would be less cause to
bicker. There is an acute
shortage of extension-officers
for general farm information,
of farm-economists, of herd-
recorders and of research-
workers for all kinds of
problems. v
• Many matters, both tech-
nical and political, are being
studied which promise great
improvements in the industry,
even to the extent of lowered
prices and increased exports.
Such studies include: improve-
ment of cattle by artificial in-
semination and by- more and
more herd-recording; work-
study and the economic
aspects of farm-management;
bulk-milk pick-up from the
farms ; total intake of milk into
large factories, which process
and market all parts of the
milk ; payment for the solids
in milk rather than for the
weight of milk or for the

butterfat it contains; deep-
freeze storing and new methods
of drying, condensing and
sterilising ; transporting whole-
milk long distances as opposed
to producing it where needed ;
short-cuts in butter- and
cheese-manufacture ; new pro-
ducts, such as ghee, homo-
genised milk and fancy
cheeses ; advertising to increase
consumption and combat cheap
substitutes ; pooling and
equalisation of marketing ; new
organisation in the control of
production and marketing.
Our most urgent study, how-
ever, is to examine and clarify
our aims.
Are milk-products to be
regarded as items of ordinary
merchandise, to be dealt in,
transported, stored, cornered
and manipulated to the com-
mercial advantage of one sec-
tion or another? Are technical
advances which improve milk's
purity and keeping-quality to
be used simply to extend the
period over which it can be
exploited commercially, before
it finally reaches the consumer,
almost stale, or are they to
result in more consumers
getting a fresh, pure and whole-
some article? Should not the
supply of such vitally necessary
foodstuffs be treated as an
essential public utility, and
removed, as far as possible,
from commercial exploitation?
Preserving a balance between
the conflicting interests and
demands of producers and
consumers is a constant political
problem, which might be eased
by a great deal more control
by co-operative organisations.
As far as world requirements
for dairy-products go, there is
no actual surplus—far from it.
Many millions of people are
short of food —particularly of
the fats and proteins which milk
has in such abundance and
these people provide large
potential markets for our
products.
r It remains for organisers to
arrange financial and political
means of supplying these
people, while the task of pro-
ducers, manufacturers and
merchants is to turn-out and
deliver as good a product at as
low a price as possible.
Fruit-fly
“Dix”: I think “Malua” (B.
11/2/’59) exaggerates when he
says it is to defeat the fruit-fly
that fruit is picked green, and
so becomes tasteless when ripe.
Any grower will tell you that
to leave fruit on the tree until
it is even partly ripe is to run
the risk of landing it on the
market in an overripe and
therefore unsaleable condition.
This applies to most stone-
fruits and even to bananas and
tomatoes.
I agree that the fruit-fly is
a menace to growers today and
that its spread is encouraged by
backyard-growers too lazy or
indifferent to take precautions
against it. However, I live in
a fly-infested area and I have
kept a fairly heavy crop of
tomatoes free from the pest in
the last two seasons simply by
using the sugar, water, D.D.T.
and nicotine-sulphate mixture
recommended by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. I haven’t
had to spray the bushes with
this either —it is sufficient to
splash the mixture on the leaves
at isolated spots every four
or five days. In wet weather,
of course, more frequent appli-
cations are necessary.
1 do not dispute that the
alternative method recom-
mended by “Malua” is effec-
tive, but prefer to keep the soil
around my plants free of weeds
and other rubbish and use the
simple mixture recommended.
On the general question of
tasteless fruit, I have found that
some varieties of peaches,
though large and well-colored,
are quite tasteless even when
allowed to ripen on the tree.
I often wonder why anyone
bothers to grow them. They
sell on their appearance ; and
for that reason, I presume, are
a paying proposition, but for
eating or cooking purposes they
are practically worthless.
Branding Problems
“Sundowner”: While the
various Departments of Agri-
culture and the C.5.1.R.0. are
still working on the durability
and scourability of branding-
fluids, the following precau-
tions may reduce trouble from
brands:
Don’t brand more than 1500
sheep to each gallon of fluid ;
the ideal is 1000 sheep a gallon.
Ordinary No. 8 gauge
fencing-wire (not flattened) or
hoop-iron on edge makes a
good branding-iron.
Brand above the rubbing-
line.
Don’t make brands too large.
A 3in. to 3iin. brand is the
ideal size.
Don’t put a woollen pad on
the bottom of the tin. Keep
of fluid in the tin and
replenish it from stock-solution
as required.
Don't mix commercial pre-
parations with fluids like
engine-oil, petrol or turpen-
tine. Even raddle can be made
unscourable if adulterated with
some of these liquids.
Footrot Control
in W.A.
Footrot in sheep probably
dates back to the earliest im-
portations, and its incidence
has plagued Australia ever
since. Various kinds of treat-
ment have been practised for
a long time ; but the disease is
so widely spread and flocks so
easily infected that the possi-
bility of its eradication has
hardly been considered.
As a result of the work that
has been done by C. R. Toop,
Chief Veterinary Officer, and
his assistants of the animal
division of the West Australian
Department of Agriculture,
footrot may in time be entirely
eliminated from the State. If
it can be done in Western Aus-
tralia there is no reason why it
should not be done-in the other
States, or, for that matter,
anywhere in the world.
In the Geraldton district,
which has a large sheep-popu-
lation and where the disease is
known to have existed for over
100 years, footrot was com-
pletely eradicated more than
two years ago. More than 600
properties in widely separated
parts of the agricultural areas
have been freed from the
disease. In the Bridgetown
district, a high-rainfall area
where the disease had a strong
grip, more than 200 properties
have been cleaned-up, and it
is hoped that footrot will soon
be eliminated.
Serious outbreaks occurred
last year in the war-service
land-settlement area of Mt.
Many Peaks, near Albany,
another district with high rain-
fall, but these have now been
brought under control, though
it is too early yet for the area
to be declared free of the
disease.
It was only natural for foot-
rot to spread more rapidly
along the south-coast and the
lower south-western areas,
because of wetter conditions
and the longer growing-period
of pastures, and also because,

over the last few years, there
have been considerably more
pastures developed there, most
of which were stocked with
sheep. Many of the owners of
these properties were new to
the sheep-industry and picked
up their stock wherever they
could, thus risking the intro-
duction of footrot into
country that is highly favorable
to its development. In spite
of this, there have been few
serious outbreaks and none
on the scale of those at Mt.
Many Peaks.
At the end of 1958 there were
55 properties still under
quarantine in the State, and it
was expected that at least half
of these would be declared
clean before the end of the
summer.
The Department of Agri-
culture’s campaign is based on
the discovery, about 20 years
ago, that the germ of footrot
cannot survive away from the
sheep for more than 14 days.
A paddock which has not been
stocked with sheep for a fort-
night or more is free of the
germ, no matter how badly
affected the sheep which pre-
viously grazed it may have
been. It can only be reinfected
by the introduction of stock
which carry the germ.
The strict quarantine im-
posed on an affected property
prevents the disease spreading
to other farms, and, wherever
possible, it is recommended
that infected sheep should be
sold for immediate slaughter.
Of course, this is not always
possible, and sheep retained
under quarantine are very
carefully examined.
As a start, each foot is
inspected and pared. Then the
sheep are walked through
germicidal foot-baths and put
into paddocks known to be
clean. This process of exami-
nation and treatment is
repeated until the veterinary
inspectors are satisfied that
every sheep on the property
is free from the disease, and
the quarantine is not lifted
until then. By that time the
owner knows that footrot will
not occur in his land again
unless he introduces infected
stock. Most of the treatment
and cleaning-up work is done
during summer, when weather
and pastures are dry and con-
ditions are most favorable.
It is emphasised that every
part of an infected property —
particularly drafting - yards,
races and trucks used for
transport of sheep —must be
regarded as infected unless it
is known that sheep have not
used it for 14 days or more.
These methods of dealing
with footrot, initiated in
Western Australia, are now
being adopted in other States,
and if they are rigidly followed,
much of the loss and suffering
caused by the disease can be
avoided.
Complete elimination of
footrot must be a long job, but
success could eventually be
achieved provided that it is
declared a notifiable disease
in every State and that proper
methods for its control and
cure are thoroughly and
drastically carried out.

Fowl-mites
“Windy”: Fowl-mites worry
poultry and also make life a
misery for those who have to
work around the infested pens
The tropical fowl-mite is a
bloodsucking parasite. By
constantly piercing the skin of
the bird to get blood it sets
up severe irritation, developing
into inflamed patches and a
watery discharge, which mats
on the surface of the skin. The
constant irritation puts hens
off the lay; birds that are
being fattened for market begin
to lose weight. If the mites are
very thick, loss of blood will
cause a bird to become thin
and scraggy, the comb losing
its fresh color and turning
yellow.
The mite can easily be seen
by catching a bird and search-
ing through the feathers, when
it will be found close to the
skin. Unlike many parasites,
the mite stays on the bird day
and night, so the best way to
look for mites is to catch
several birds on the roost after
they have settled-in for the
night.
Mites breed in cracks in the
woodwork round the pens or
in cracked or rotted timber on
the perches. They are easily
destroyed, provided treatment
is not delayed too long. One
of the simplest ways of getting
rid of them is to paint the
perches with gammexane paint,
which can be bought from any
poultry-supply house. Mix the
paint with sump-oil and work
it well into the timber with
a stiff paint-brush (a clean
brush that has worn down a
bit is ideal for the job). Paint
all parts of the roost, because
gammexane depends on its
fumes to kill the mites. As
the heat of the bird’s body
warms the surrounding air as
well as the perch, the paint
liberates fumes which spread
through the feathers and
fumigate them. To ensure that
the mites are all destroyed,
perches and other woodwork
should be painted at weekly
intervals. Once gammexane
has lost its punch, the mites
could build-up again.
The tropical fowl-mite atso
breeds on walls and other
surfaces. Timber walls, when
they begin to roughen, make an
ideal hiding-place. The sur-
faces are best treated by spray-
ing with dieldrin. Use a % per
cent, solution and force the
spray well into the surface
with a knapsack- or bucket-
spray. Dieldrin has a lasting
effect ; it needs renewing about
onqe a fortnight for a start, but
after the mites have been con-
trolled, monthly spraying will
stop them from breeding again.
Commercial poultry-breeders
should wash their clothes
regularly when mites are bad.
The parasites can breed very
rapidly in clothing and may
reinfest an otherwise clean
shed.
The Flying-fox
“North”: Queensland Uni-
versity zoologists are making
an all-out effort to save the
fruit industry thousands of
pounds annually by bringing
the flying-fox under control.
After a recent mass-shoo-t, 250
of the pests were collected for
biological examination. This
is part of a research-project to
study their habits: migration,
breeding-cycles, mating be-
havior, food-preferences and
reactions to smell, sight and
hearing. The zoologists plan to
raid all known “camps” within
100 miles of Brisbane and to
collect further specimens.
There are several species of
flying-fox or fruit-bat, but only
two can be considered pests.
The large dark-grey fox, with
a reddish mantle and breast
and a wingspan up to 4ft., is
far more destructive than the
smaller red fellow.
The foxes make “camps” in
inaccessible places, where
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(12/2/’59)
Queensland should receive heavy rains during March,
with falls patchy in the far south-west district. Flooding
is likely in many areas, particularly on the central and
north coasts and in the central-west and south-west districts.
Much of the State may expect reasonably good rains in
April.
The coastal district of N.S.W. should receive moderate
rains in March, with good rains around Pt. Macquarie
and on the coast from Sydney southwards. The rest of the
State may have only light to moderate patchy rains.
Moderate general rains should occur in April, with heavy
falls on the central and mid-north coastal districts and part
of the Hunter River Valley.
Victoria can expect reasonably good rains in March,
with heaviest falls in the central and western divisions.
Rainfall may be patchy during late autumn and winter.
Rainfall may be poor in most of South Australia dur-
ing March, although the central and south-east districts
and Murray Valley should receive moderate rain.
Seasonal rains should begin in the agricultural areas during
May.
Poor rainfall may occur in most of Western Australia
during March, although the south-east and north-east areas
should receive good rains. The south-west agricultural
areas can expect reasonably good rains in May.

thousands congregate. Sleeping
by day, they sally forth in
search of food at dusk and
often travel many miles to
find feeding-grounds. Native
flowers, especially those of the
gums, wild-figs and other
scrub-fruits, are their natural
diet, but they will attack all
varieties of commercial fruits
and waste more than they
consume.
Raiding of “camps” by
shooting-parties is never par-
ticularly successful. Only a
small percentage of the bats are
killed, and after a couple of
raids the remainder go else-
where. Scaring them from
orchards is a better method.
They fly in columns thousands
strong and follow a well-
defined path each night. Firing
a shotgun every few minutes
as they pass overhead will
keep them from alighting on
the trees.
Salt Care
“Big Billy”: At all times
ensure that farm-animals don’t
get too much salt. More than
1 per cent, in a -feed-mixture
can produce symptoms of
poisoning and other harmful
effects. The pig is one of the
worst sufferers.
If salt accumulates in the
bottom of a bin, food must
be moved to another part of
the trough or the receptacle
must be thoroughly cleaned. If
animals' show any sign of dis-
tress due to too much salt,
increase the water-supply and
cut-off mixed feed for awhile.
Closing a Flock
“Jackpot”: In her article (B.
4/2/’59), Helen Newton
Turner has presented the case
with admirable moderation and
restraint. But her question:
“Is the observed slackening in
the rate of progress (towards
higher fleece-weights) inevit-
able?” deserved a more detailed
answer, since upon it depends
the limitations of the system of
selection and fleece-testing. A
good deal has been written
about this system in recent
years, but unfortunately this
point has been by-passed.
The experience of top stud-
breeders indicates that the rate
cannot be maintained as
quality of stock increases, and
this seems to be supported by
theoretical considerations.
Individual characters owe
their expression in the animal
to the presence of the particular
genes controlling them. Fleece-
weight is considered to be con-
trolled by an unknown but
limited number of genes (call
them plus genes), each one
adding to the effect of the
others. As the number of these
genes increases, so will the
fleece-weight other factors
remaining equal.
If this conception is correct,
then there must be an upper
limit, beyond which breeding,
no matter how carefully done,
cannot produce any further
increase. This limit would be
reached in any animal possess-
ing the full complement of
these plus genes.
By mating highly selected
animals (those likely to have
a high number of plus genes)
the breeder is aiming to in-
crease the frequency of occur-
rence of these genes in his
flock.
Discussing the effect of
selection on an animal popula-
tion, the American geneticist
Jay Lush, in his book Animal
Breeding Plans, comes to the
conclusion that “selection is
most effective (the rate of im-
provement is largest) when the
frequency of the desired gene
is somewhere near the middle
of its possible range, and least
when the frequency is near zero
or 1.0.
“If the desired gene is very
rare, the increase in its fre-
quency made by selection
would be small at first, simply
because there is not enough
genetic variability in the popu-
lation. As the frequency of the
desired gene rises towards the
values near the middle of its
range, progress would become
faster and faster until it
reached a maximum. After
that, the rate of progress would
decrease.”
In the light of stud-breeders’
experience, and until some evi-
dence to the contrary is forth-
coming, it seems the wisest
thing to accept this increasing
difficulty in maintaining im-
provement-rate as part and
parcel of the breeder’s burden.
Fleece-weighing as an aid to
selection is an extremely
valuable tool (I have been
using it for 15 years), and the
increase of |lb. in average
clean fleece-weight in the
course of six years, as quoted
by Miss Turner, is highly
attractive. But only a bold
man would expect to hold such
a rate, which in 50 years would
increase the flock average by
about 12lb. greasy.
Turkey-raising
“Sundowner”: When an
owner has plenty of space to
allow the birds free range,
turkey-raising proves an eco-
nomic proposition. Youngsters
of eight weeks are able to take
a variety of food. They can
be fed mash and grain with
greenfeed to supply the
vitamins (hence the advantage
of a big area for them to get
pickings). Where green pick-
ings are limited, lawn-clippings
can be used instead. Lawns
used for this purpose should,
however, receive annual dress-
ings of complete fertiliser to
prevent the loss of nutritive
value in these clippings.
As the birds get bigger, free
choice grain and a mash con-
taining 15 per cent, of meat-
meal should be fed. Turkeys
will make good use of all
grains—barley, maize and oats,
as well as wheat. Birds up to
12 weeks, if allowed to wander
freely about the property, will
need protection against sudden
cold and rainstorms, and there
must be sufficient shade.
Eight weeks is a suitable
time to take precautions against
birds flying.- Clipping of the
outer half of the primary
feathers of one wing will
suffice. An equally effective
method, which can be put into
operation earlier, is to cut the
last segment of the wing just
beyond the pinion - joint
between three and seven days
of age. It isn’t necessary to
deal with gobblers, as they use
their wings to maintain balance
when breeding.
A good water-supply is
essential for successful turkey-
rearing. If kept in complete
confinement from eight weeks
on, 100 birds will need about
40 lin.-ft. of feeder space and
8 lin.-ft. of drinking space. As
the birds get bigger, it’s better,
though, to let them wander
freely about the farm with
feeding- and drinking-points
strategically placed and with
trees or other shelter available.
Crosscuts
“M’Lou”: Bag-sewing and
bags are now a thing of the
past on the Beulah West (Vic.)
farm of K. J. and V. T. Liston.
They have had built for them
in Horsham (Vic.) the biggest
field-bin yet seen in western
Victoria. Twenty-six feet long,
lift, wide and 9ft. high, it will
hold 500 bags of wheat.
“M a c Murick”: The
hammer-mill has more uses
than just making lucerne-meal.
An enterprising poultry-farmer
puts dry poultry - manure
through, then packages the
powder in 51b. and 101 b. bags
and retails it at a price that
returns more than the sale of
the other products of his birds.

an important part of good

Tests in the U.S.A. show that
a cow grazed for just under
two hours during the daytime
when temperatures were 90
deg. F. or higher, but the same
animal grazed six-and-a-half
hours at night.

Brief account of the legendary
Fawcett story of exploration in
South America ?
Lt.-Col. P. H. Fawcett, who had
spent much of his life wandering
around and exploring South
America, left on his last (and most
famous) trip of exploration early in
1925, setting out to discover a “lost
civilisation” in the hinterland of
Brazil. The last word from him
was in a letter to his wife dated
May 29, 1925, and brought back by
some natives, which concludes:
“You need have no fear of any
failure.” There were many subse-
quent reports of his whereabouts,
and in succeeding years several other
expeditions set out to solve the
mystery. in 1928 Commander G.
M. Dyott retraced Fawcett’s route
for some distance and claimed that
he had found evidence that the
party had been killed by Indians.
One of Fawcett’s sons, Brian (born
1906), who also spent much of his
life in South America, at last
decided to try to track-down the
truth of the story which had
fascinated his father. In 1952 and
again in 1955 he explored Brazil
from the air, and found the “lost
civilisation” —“rock-masses, caprici-
ously formed, deeply cut by long,
trenchlike defiles, or rising in ter-
races resembling the turrets of some
ruined bastion.” in Ruins in ihe
Sky (1958) Brian Fawcett prints
photographs of these rock-forma-
tions which show clearly how the
legend arose.

Information on the current acti-
vities of Sydney’s Trust Players ?
The Trust Players, Sydney’s first
permanent theatre-company, will
present a season of five plays, begin-
ning on Wednesday, March 11.
First play will be “The Slaughter of
St. Teresa’s Day,” a comedy-drama
by Sydney actor Peter Kenna. Four
plays have been chosen, two of
which are Australian, with a fifth
to be announced during the season,
and the plays will change monthly.
Second Australian play, “The
Bastard Country,” is by J. Anthony
Coburn. Included in the repertoire
are Shaw’s “Man and Superman”
and Shakspeare’s “Julius Caesar.”
A permanent group of eight Aus-
tralians form the nucleus of the
company. Among them are stage
and radio stars Neva Carr Glyn,
Dinah Shearing, Frank Waters and
Ron Haddrick.
Presentation-dates are as follows:
March 11, “The Slaughter of St.
Teresa’s Day”; April 8, “Man and
Superman”; May 6, “The Bastard
Country”; June 3, “Julius Caesar,”
and the play scheduled for July 1
will be announced later.

The original Gimcrack Stakes
was a classic race of the English
Jockey Club. It dates back to the
17th or 18th century, and is famous
because on the night after the race
the members of the Jockey Club
and the owner, trainer and rider of
the winning horse are entertained
at a Gimcrack dinner at which
members of Royalty are present.
At Randwick it is a race for fillies.

What route was followed by the
exploring expedition which dis-
covered the Canberra district, and
who were the explorers ?
There were various explorations
in the locality, Lake George being
discovered as early as 1816. The
final major exploration of the dis-
trict was undertaken by a naval cap-
tain, Mark John Currie, and John
Ovens, of the 74th Regiment. In
May, 1823, accompanied by Joseph
Wild, an experienced b'ushman, they
left Throsby Park, near Moss Vale,
to explore the country south of
Lake George. On May 31 they
camped on the river near the site
of Queanbeyan, and on the follow-
ing day crossed the Limestone Plains
and discovered a small plain which
they named Isabella’s Plain. Arriv-
ing at the Murrumbidgee River, they
were unable to cross. For the next
five days the party travelled in a
southerly direction, crossed the
Umaralla River under the impres-
sion it was the Murrumbidgee, and
on June 6 discovered fertile plains
which are now known as the
Monaro Plains. The discoveries of
this expedition were followed almost
immediately by pioneer settlement.

How to remove a tree-stump with
chemicals ?
A useful method for rapidly kill-
ing a tree, at the same time
reducing suckering to a minimum, is
to frill it and poison with arsenic-
pentoxide or arsenite-of-soda.
Experiments during recent years
have shown that arsenic-pentoxide
is the more effective compound
where timber is difficult to kill, since
is has greater penetrative power.
It is sold in a granulated form ready
to mix with cold water, and should
be used at the rate of 31b. to
sgals. water. Arsenite-of-soda can
also be bought ready to dilute with
cold water, and is used at the rate
of lib. (80 per cent, strength) to
2gals. water. A number of liquid
arsenical weedkillers are available:
most contain about 50 per cent,
arsenious-oxide and should be
diluted about 1 part in 15 parts
water.
Some landholders prefer to make
the preparation themselves; here
are general directions for prepara-
tion of poisons:
Arsenic —the ordinary white
arsenious-oxide is not soluble in
water to any great extent, so that
soda, either ordinary washing-soda
or caustic-soda, has to be used to
dissolve -it. When large amounts
of the solution are required
washing-soda is the cheaper, but for
small quantities of solution caustic-
soda is handiest. Whether caustic-
soda or washing-soda is used, first
dissolve the soda in water, using
heat, if desirable, to hasten the
process; then slowly add the
arsenic, which has been previously
made into a thin paste (as the
housewife treats her cornflour),
stirring all the time; place on a
strong fire and boil for at least
half-an-hour; stir from time to
time, being careful to stand on the
side away from the fumes, as they
are poisonous. When the arsenic
is thoroughly dissolved, the solution
may be made up to the required
bulk by adding the rest of the
water, either hot or cold. A useful
formula for quick and effective
work on all kinds of timber is:
arsenic, lib, washing-soda, lib.
(or caustic-soda, |lb.), and water,
3gals.
Best time to do the work is when
the tree is passing into the dormant
stage — i.e., when the sap-flow in the
tree is ceasing. This period varies
in different districts, but as a rule
it begins around February.
Having decided on the season and
dissolved the poison, the tree must
be “frilled”—a succession of down-
ward axe-cuts made round it, each
cut well overlapping the adjoining
ones. Cuts should be through the
bark and well into the wood proper,
and pretty close to ground-level —
say, 6in. to lOin. up. For trees
of 4ft. diameter pour about a
quart of solution into this frilling
right round the tree.
No estimate of cost can be
given; prices for arsenic, caustic-
soda and washing-soda are apt to
vary. Neither saltpetre nor any
other chemical is of any value in
assisting the burning of stumps.

Before World War II Britain pro-
duced about 31 per cent, of its
food-supply (in terms of calories
for human consumption). By 1956
this had risen to nearly 40 per cent.,
and in terms of value represented
about one-half, compared with a
little over one-third before the war.
Food and feeding-stuff's (including
oils and oilseeds) accounted for 45
per cent, of pre-war total imports
and 38 per cent, in 1956. Produc-
tion-trends since the war show an
increase in agricultural production
(of the order of 50 per cent, since
pre-war) in spite of a slow decline
in the agricultural labor-force.
There has, in fact, been a large
increase in the productivity of labor,
due to improved crop and livestock
varieties, more intensive use of fer-
tilisers, pesticides and fungicides,
and greatly increased mechanisation,
which has made possible the work-
ing of much larger acreages of
arable land. Increase of agricul-
tural production and productivity
has been a major objective of
Government policy. (2) Doubtful
if the system would work —if, in
fact, it is really necessary.

New Recordings
An Accordionist
In an H.M.V. disk titled
Roman Spectacular ( Vol. 2)
(OCLP 7539) accordionist
Charles Magnante starts right
off in “Oh, Marie” with a few
brilliant flourishes on an
instrument almost as fiery-
toned as a Spanish pipe-organ
■—the sort of introduction
reserved for virtuosi.
While the accordion is,
perhaps, too rich a solo
instrument for sustained listen-
ing, you have only to note
Magnante’s crisp and feathery
embellishments above piano
and glockenspiel in “Tra
Veglia E Sonno,” or his
piquant solo line in “Blue Skies
of Naples,” to realise that he
is a technical master.
Everywhere in the record
there is an atmosphere of both
sunshine and espresso coffee-
bars. The numbers, all popular
Italian songs, aren’t sung, but
Magnante and his players,
especially Tony Mo 11 o 1 a
(guitar) and Dick Dia (man-
dolin), easily compensate for
that. It is just the kind of music
you find in those lavishly
colored Mediterranean travel-
films.
Rossini’s “La Danza,” on the
second side, is refreshing:
shorn of a great bellowing
Neapolitan bass, the music
skitters along gracefully, with
the accordion giving point and
clarity. And in the “Jolly
Barber” Tarantella, while you
marvel at Magnante’s tech-
nique, other instruments,
notably glockenspiel and
tambourine, stand out in sharp
brilliance. One learns that
“Mattinata” is really the tune
“You’re Breaking my Heart”
(or vice versa), and that it is
treated with the same colorful
reverence as. the other Italian
fare ; and there is an “Opera
Medley,” featuring melodies
from “La Boherne,” “Caval-
leria Rusticana” and “Tra-
viata.” In “O Sole Mio” Mag-
nante just about takes your
breath away with several quick-
silver flashing descents —one in
thirds.
From the 1 viewpoint of
recording this is one of the
best high-fidelity disks writer
has heard. Surfaces are excep-
tionally good, and if you tune
your radiogram reasonably
high on the treble register
Magnante and his orchestra
seem to be there in the flesh.
Mood Music
In Lovers in the Dark
(H.M.V. OCLP 1151) Tony
Osborne and his orchestra
fulfil their intentions as the
jacket-note puts it, “Who can
listen without thinking of that
special someone?” And even
if you aren’t fortunate enough
to share the music with a
special someone, it can still be
easily digested. Osborne has
a gentle approach, and, though
he doesn’t break much new
ground (plenty of piano
arpeggio-work, muted brass,
etc.), he treats his numbers
pleasantly.
On the first side the “Two
Shadows” melody is filled-out
with some mellow saxophone-
playing ; “You and the Night
and the Music” features above
rhythm background, strings
and voices, a rippling sweep on
the piano, from high treble to
tenor —an effect duplicated in
the first number on the second
side, “The Second Star to the
Right.” AH the music is glued
to an inexorably marching
brush-drum bass.
Other melodies are: “Two
Silhouettes,” “A Kiss in the
Dark,” “When You Wish upon
a Star,” “Lovers in the
Dark,” “Whispers in the Dark,”
“Two Cigarettes in the Dark,”
“Dream Lover” 'and, as an
appropriate conclusion to
mood-music centred on night-
fall, “I’ll See You in My
Dreams.”
The voices, when they
occur, contribute little except
soothing vowel-sounds ; but
then, lovers, particularly those
in the dark, would hardly
appreciate actual words. Mr.
Osborne’s discretion is wholly
admirable, and so is the disk,
if you want a bit of smooth
after-dinner music or a pastel
backdrop to romance.

Wordless Opera
Those who like opera (or,
-rather, opera-music) will pro-
bably go for Opera without
Words (London label, HAA
2070): on one side, Leon-
cavallo's “Pagliacci”; on the
other, Giordano’s “Andrea
Chenier.”
The question, of course, is
whether opera-music can legiti-
mately be presented without
words. Followers of opera,
familiar with each work’s plot
and dialogue, might say:
“Well, what does it matter? In
such-and-such a spot Canio
goes off for a drink and leaves
Nedda to sing about the
birds.” But while the music on
this disk makes reasonably
good listening, you tend to
feel you’re missing something.
Still, opera-lovers must
admire Domenico Savini’s
direction of the Rome Sym-
phony Orchestra, even if, near
the beginning of “Pagliacci,”
his nuances are a trifle rough.
There is an exciting moment in
the crescendo drum-roll right at
the -end of the first side, and
some of the orchestral playing
sparkles for instance, the
dialogue between trumpets,
trombones and drums early on
the same side.
“Andrea Chenier,” on the
reverse side, is nearer to pure
listening-music: certainly you
aren’t quite as aware of the
absence of words. For one
thing, Giordano is more color-
ful ; he decorates a lengthy
’cello theme with harp arpeggi,
and makes striking use of oboe
and strings playing together—
the tone of the violins is rich
and wavy, and you suddenly
notice a pleasant reedy tang
behind it.
Surfaces are fair ; and there
is a bit of “clicking” on the
first side.

The High Commissioner for Ceylon,
Mr. B. F. Perera, and his dainty wife
were entertained at a luncheon at Ciro’s
by members of the Australian-Asian
Association, headed by their president,
Sir Charles Lowe, who was accompanied
by Lady Lowe. Posters illustrating
various aspects of Ceylon decorated the
walls, and on the official table was a
striking arrangement of tropical fruit.
Madame Perera’s graceful sari was of
silk in multicolored checks. Lady Lowe
chose a blue-and-white-printed silk frock
with a matching navy silk coat and navy
straw hat trimmed with white flowers.
Among the many guests were the
president of the women’s group of the
association, Mrs. R. T. Breen ; the hon.
secretary, Mrs. John Dynon, whose small
off-the-face hat of forget-me-not-blue
linen-straw went with a sheath-frock of
white-and-blue-patterned cotton-brocade ;
Mr. and Mrs. John Chaldjian ; Mrs.
John Shaw ; Mrs. Bing Molyneux ; Mr.
and Mrs. A. H. Tolley (her frock was of
navy silk-romaine, while navy lined her
scarlet straw collie-hat); Sir Albert
Coates; Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Myer
(she smart in a sailor-hat of natural straw
banded with tangerine to match her white
cotton shirt-frock, which was patterned
in beige and tangerine); and Thai Consul
H. I. Fader and Mrs. Fader, the latter
attractive in a dress and bloused-jacket of
soft-blue Honan-silk and a toque of
beige-and-white folded-satin.
Later in the day the High Commis-
sioner and Madame Perera entertained at
a cocktail-party at Royal Commonwealth
Society House in Queen’s Road. Among
the guests were the president of the
Legislative Council, the Hon. Gordon
McArthur, and his wife ; Sir Arthur and
Lady Warner, Sir John Jungwirth, Mr.
and Mrs. Murray Porter, Mr. and Mrs.
Colin Bednall and Mr. and Mrs. Jack

“Auntie Marne” made her bow at the
Princess Theatre to a large and enthusias-
tic audience. Shirl Conway, taking the
title-role with one ankle strapped, due
to a fall at dress-rehearsal, gave a lively
and outstanding performance. There
were many lovely gowns in the audience,
but the short theatre-frock prevailed and
was seen in filmy chiffons and organzas
and fragile lace. Mrs. Garnet Carroll
wore an attractive gown of lace in soft-
brown tonings; it had a peacock-
hemline and a wide decollete scalloped
neckline. With her husband, Mrs. Carroll
received Lord Mayor Thomas and the
Lady Mayoress. Mrs. Thomas wore a
short, full-skirted frock of apricot-tinted
satin and a shell-pink sari-stole. Mrs.
Keith Hattam wore one of the loveliest
frocks. Of white guipure-lace, short and
strapless, it was mounted on shocking-
pink silk-taffeta ; her wide stole was in
matching pink taffeta. Mrs. Len Buxton’s
short black taffeta frock had the skirt
cleverly draped. She was with her son-
in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. John
Stoney.
After the performance, Mr. and Mrs.
Garnet Carroll entertained 200 guests and
the cast of “Auntie Marne” at a supper-
party in the Bamboo Room at Chevron
Hotel. Fried-rattlesnake sandwiches and
a new drink, Flaming Marne, were served
—with, of course,- the other appetising
food for which Chevron is noted.
Penny Lane, eldest daughter of Mr.

ing at Glamorgan, the prep, school for
Geelong Grammar. Tall and graceful,
Penny, like her sister Barbara, is one of
the popular members of the younger set.
She enjoys tennis and sailing and hopes
soon to go overseas.
Every woman in the audience went
home carrying a presentation package
of tropical fruits on the opening night
of the Tiv.'s new show, “Tropical Holi-
day,” and with it went a recipe for
“tropical-holiday,” a delectable fruit-
drink. Noted there Sir Frank and Lady
Richardson, the latter wearing a short
black faille frock with a sapphire-blue
mink stole; Cr. and Mrs. Maurice
Nathan, she in a long-sleeved black lace
frock and white cardigan trimmed with
white fox-fur; Dr. and Mrs. W. Mc-
Dermott (her short white satin frock
patterned in autumn tonings) and
daughter Patricia ; Mrs. Frank Christie,
who chose a sapphire - and - white -
patterned frock ; Tiv. manager Gordon
Cooper and his wife ; Dr. and Mrs. P.
McCumisky; Mr. and Mrs. Norman
Lynch and Mr. and Mrs. S. G. Aarons.
Already busy with two organisations
(she’s president of Prince Henry’s Hospital
Auxiliaries and of the Royal Melbourne
Hospital Almoner Auxiliary), Mrs. W. K.
Burnside will be one of the four hostesses
at a dinner-dance to be held at Ciro’s
tomorrow night (February 26) in aid of
the Yooralla Crippled Children’s Appeal.
Mrs. S. P. Kroussos, Mrs. Jeff Macartney
and Mrs. G. R. Sheppard are the other
hostesses. Mrs. Burnside goes into action
again on March 4, when, with members
of the committee of the Royal Melbourne
Almoner Auxiliary, she will present an
Easter Bonnet Fiesta at a luncheon at
Ciro’s, during which Ronald Bernarde
will show his winter collection. Tickets
are 30s. each, and proceeds will go to
the hospital’s ambulance - fund. Entree
cards will be sent on receipt of cheque,
which should be made payable to the
Almoner Auxiliary and addressed to Mrs.
S. P. Kroussos, 517 Royal Parade,
Parkville.

CANBERRA
The formal opening of the 23rd Com-
monwealth Parliament was followed in
the evening by a reception at Parliament
House given by the presiding-officers and
Cabinet Ministers, and 900 guests were
entertained. Though officially a recep-
tion, the function had been referred to so
often as a ball in official circles that
much confusion arose in the minds of
the guests, and this was reflected in the
dressing, which was of a very mixed
variety. Formal ball-gowns were in
contrast with cocktail-frocks, while
among men the black tie was by no
means universal; many lounge-suits were
worn.
The Governor-General, Sir' William
Slim, was guest-of-honor; Lady Slim
did not attend because of an indisposi-
tion. His Excellency was greeted by
the Prime Minister and Dame Pattie
Menzies ; she chose a formal gown in
pink guipure-lace, the bodice embroidered
with crystal and silver beads. The
official party included Sir Alister Mc-
Mullin and Lady McMullin ; Mr. and
Mrs. J. McLeay; Sir Eric and Lady
Harrison; Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Casey
(her full-length frock in scarlet brocade


was worn with a matching stole); Mrs.
Harold Holt, who accompanied her hus-
band, wore a glamorous gown in
turquoise-and-gold organza.
Mrs. John Howse added a touch of
difference to her sheath gown in white
lace with a pink feather-boa. An attrac-
tive frock in pleated pink chiffon was
worn by Mrs. Keith Newman, formerly
of Melbourne. Among the many diplo-
mats present were Lord and Lady
Carrington (her striking gown in ruby-
red satin); the Japanese Ambassador and
Mrs. T. Suzuki, who will leave Australia
shortly for Rome; the Minister for
Sweden, Mr. C. Bergenstrahle. Also noted
Senator Agnes Robertson chatting to
Mrs. Charles Walton, of Sydney, who
wore an eye-catching crimson cloak over
black lace.
King’s Hall was transformed into a
ballroom where the R.A.A.F. dance-band
(up from Melbourne with Squadron-
Leader Hicks in command) played during
the evening.
SYDNEY
Catch-topics of the week included Mr.
Macmillan’s white fur-hat worn in
Moscow, which won the top fashion-
notice. (“What would you call it —a sort
of high toque?”) There will probably
be quite a few high toques in white fur
on the market ere long. Another topic
was actress Sabrina, who flew into
Sydney and flew out again to Adelaide
almost immediately, but should be back
now. The quick glimpse we got of her
indicated glamor -plus, and her determi-
nation not to disappoint the Adelaide
people, for whom she was judging a
beauty-competition, won her approba-
tion. Dr. Billy Graham’s preparations
for his visit in April impressed. About
9000 people are being trained as coun-
sellors and their aim is to have knocked
on every door in Sydney before Dr.
Graham’s crusade begins on April 12i
The counsellors have been chosen from
lists submitted by ministers of various
denominations throughout Sydney. What
is more, they will knock again on every
door after the crusade. So no wonder
one is impressed.

Crying “Heigh-ho, the wind and the
rain! ” (perhaps) various art-lovers set
out last windy Wednesday to view
divergent shows. One was the Sunday
and John Reed collection from Mel-
bourne which was opened at David Jones’
Gallery by the University of Sydney’s
Vice-Chancellor, Prof. S. H. Roberts.
John Reed said a few words, though
Sunday was back home in Melbourne.
(“Someone has to feed the cats” said
John, “there are 30 of them.”) Saw Lady
Plowman there, Mrs. Douglas Dundas,
Mrs. Joan Tillam (Clifton Gardens), Mrs.
H. J. Buchanan. They all seemed to
understand the paintings, which is more
than this reporter could.
Meanwhile, mid-Victorian paintings
were being auctioned on behalf of the
National Art Gallery by James Lawson.
The 37 canvases, which had cost £lO,OOO
in their day, raised about £5OO, and four
couldn’t find a buyer. They were alt
“story” pictures: “Savonarola,” “The
Relief of Leyden,” “The Waif,” “The
Lute Player,” etc., and all much, much
too big. Noted that St. Joseph’s College
bought four of the pictures. But, then,
“Joey’s” is a big place.

Myrtle Maggy, who died recently in
.Sydney, was a distinguished Australian
pianist and the principal exponent in this
country of the Schumann school of piano-
playing. The daughter of Percy Maggy,
journalist and music-critic, she studied
first with Sydney Moss as a child and
later in London was the student of
Matthilde and Adela Verne, who had
been pupils of Clara Schumann (one of
her fellow-students at the time was
pianist Solomon, then a child-prodigy).
Still later she studied under another pupil
of Clara Schumann, Fanny Davies. A
brilliant career followed, including a
world-tour as associate artist with the
prima donna Albani, and when she
returned to Sydney during World War I
she was appointed by Verbrugghen as
Professor of Pianoforte at the newly
founded N.S.W. State Conservatorium.
One of her students, Dorothy Gibbes,
was the first to win the diploma of the
Conservatorium, and many fine pianists
owed much to her tuition. During this
period she made a concert-tour of the
U.S.A. and Canada, and it is appropriate
that her last performance as a concerto-
player in Sydney was in the Schumann
Concerto.

lishers and agent that her three-act Aus-
tralian play “We Have Our Dreams” will
have its Continental premier at the
Theater Der Stadt, Baden Baden, Ger-
many, on March 14, under the German
title of “Regenzeit” (“A Time of Rain,”
or “The Wet Season”).
This play, which has for its setting a
Queensland banana-plantation, was first
produced at Murwillumbah (N.S.W.)
during Banana Festival Week, and has
since been presented at Rockhampton
and other centres in Queensland and
-N.S.W. It looks as though this might be
one for the Elizabethan Theatre Trust.


the family go for their holidays to the
seaside, decide to follow them. On
their way they are joined by a nicely-
drawn kelpie who has lost his boss.
Their chief adventure is that they have
to cross Big Black Mountain, where
Dirty Dick the Dingo lives—a danger-
ous creature whom they defeat with
the greatest improbability and good-
will.
“The Lucky Fall,” about a girl
named Kathy who has an aboriginal
friend.and a cubbyhouse, opens with so
attractive a picture of a little goldmin-
ing settlement in the Queensland bush
that one would rather like to steal it
from the children and have it in a
novel for grown-ups.
Margaret Paice’s plot, though,
would hardly do for grown-ups. Some-
thing seems to have gone wrong with
it. Kathy falls over a cliff and dis-
covers the gold that is going to make
everybody rich, and that is as it should
be. Only the ultimate consequences of
the great discovery are that good old
Joe, the fossicker, gets knocked on the
head, and the lovely little settlement
turns into rather a nasty town, and
Kathy, being rich, has to leave the
bush she loves and go away to the city
to school. Further, she visits the sea-
side and has adventures which, how-
ever delectable in themselves, have
little to do with the original story.
Thus the child who brings a seriously
critical eye to the construction of the
novel will be disappointed with it; but
such children, like reviewers, should be
suppressed. It is all very nicely told
and the adventures are highly adven-
turous.
Uniform Gauge
In Uniform Railway Gauge
(Lothian) Eric Harding, who began in
N.S.W. Railways, transferred to Com-
monwealth Railways, became assist-
ant-secretary of that department, and
at his retirement was Acting Perman-
ent Head of the Army Department and
civilian member of the Military Board,
has returned to one of the Australian
problems that neither he nor anyone
else has been able to solve: the joining
of our dislocated transport-systems.
His book’s first plate, of Roman
chariot-ruts in the stone roads of
Pompeii, is rather symbolical of his
theme, which seems to have been a
subject since the Caesars, and looks like
providing thought for moon-dwelling
spacemen —but the old chariot-tracks
have a more practical application: they
show that from outside-rim to outside-
rim the Roman chariot-wheels’ track
measured 4ft. which is standard
railway gauge, as fixed in England and
adopted in N.S.W. What this might
have proved if Harding had been born
in Victoria, one can only imagine.
As for Victorian and South Aus-
tralian sft. 3in. gauge, that is the Irish
gauge, adopted to enable the engines
to put more machinery between their
wheels; while the West Australian and
Queensland 3ft. 6in. gauge is men-
tioned in a chapter-head, not without
an undertone of contumely, as the
“cheap and narrow” gauge; and
indeed, says Harding, its operating-
cost in pence per gross ton-miles is as
1800 (W.A.) and 1610 (Q.) to N.S.W.’s
standard gauge’s 1280; to yictoria’s
1470; and Commonwealth standard
gauge’s mere 540.
But, skipping the melancholy, history
of commissions and committees, it
would seem that the enemies of
standard gauge know they are bad, but
are determined to sulk; 16 years after
the report of the royal commission of
1921, for instance, which provided for
6344 miles of standard gauge, S. M.
Bruce had achieved 95 miles on the
South Brisbane-Kyogle section, and
J. A. Lyons had procured 56 miles on
the Port Augusta-Port Pirie section —
“151 miles in 16 years, or an average
of miles a year.”
But Bruce and Lyons were giants of
progress compared with those who
came after. The chapter entitled “Sir
Harold Clapp’s Plan” might just as
well have been called “The Education
of Eddie,” for here we are shown E. j.
Ward, as Commonwealth Minister for
Transport, trying to strong-arm a
£44,318,000 unification project through
a conference of State Ministers and
Commissioners for Railways without
previously consulting their Govern-
ments on finance, while the Common-
wealth Co-ordinator of Works, Sir
Harry Brown, explained that he hadn’t
known what the conference would dis-
cuss, felt no progress could be' made
under seven separate controls, had no
instructions to give railway standardisa-
tion top priority, felt it should have
almost bottom priority, and con-
sidered that the man-years needed for
housing-works alone should prove that
sufficient manpower would not be
available for railway-works.
That was in 1945. In 1956 the
W. C. Wentworth committee of
Liberal M.H.R.s recommended, for
almost the same price, £41.500.000, a
much-restricted plan: Wodonga to
Melbourne (to secure standard gauge
from Sydney to Melbourne); Broken
Hill to Adelaide, via Port Pirie; and
Kalgoorlie to Perth and Fremantle.
Not to be outdone, a Labor commit-
tee recommended (no harm in recom-
mending) much the same thing. Mean-
while, Sir Harold Clapp’s plan of
1944, which, in addition to linking the
capitals, would have converted Vic-
torian and South Australian systems,
complete, to standard gauge, has
advanced in estimated cost in 14 years
from £44 million to £B4 million.
The book has an introduction by
Sir John Northcott, a photostat of a
letter from Earl Grey recommending
a uniform gauge in 1848, several pages
of plates, many sadly comic drawings,
some fortuitously comic maps and
graphs, and a beautiful big folding-map
in an envelope gummed to the back
cover.
Adventure with a Camera
Tom Stobart’s Adventurer’s Eye
(Odhams) is an exceptionally lively
book of travel and adventure, and it
might have been a mistake to subtitle
it “The Autobiography of Everest
'Film-man,” for Everest has been pretty
well covered by other writers, and
Stobart has been to all sorts of places
besides the Himalayas. _
When we first meet him he is off to
Rumania to follow a girl with whom
he is in love, just as Hitler’s war is
about to break out; and he has such
a long journey home, to dodge the
enemy, that it takes him halfway round
the world; at one point he is seen
swimming amidst sharks in the port of
Muscat, off the coast of Arabia; and
just before that, not finding the place
very romantic, he is in Baghdad.
Next he is making films for the
Army in India and, when he is on
leave for a rest-cure, strolling to the
Pindar glacier between Nanda Devi
and Nanda Cot, studying rhododend-
rons. lepers, a tiger that stalked him
at his campfire and a solitary Yogi
philosopher who asked him in an
Oxford accent for an aspirin.
Next, accompanied by a friend from
Yorkshire, he is trying to climb Nun
Kun, “a ferocious 23,000-footer” in
THE EDGE
Three times to the world’s end I went,
Three times returned as one who brings
Tidings of light beyond the dark
But voiceless stays, still marvelling.
After great p&in I had great joy
Three times that never else j knew ;
The last reflection of its light
Fcuies from the pupils, of my eyes.
Webbed by the world again 1 walk
The mazy paths that women tread
Watchful lest any harm should come
To those who journeyed back with me.
But still, as Lazarus who was born
Again beyond the edge of death,
l see the world half otherwise
And tremble at its mysteries.

ROSEMARY DOHSON.


Ladakh, the province next to Kashmir,
where he has a good time getting lost
amongst ice-cliffs in the dusk. He
promptly dashes off to the Antarctic
to make a film for the British Govern-
ment, “The White Continent,” and in
the course of the voyage notably
describes the stench of a Norwegian
whaler. On the Antarctic continent, a
very brief visit, he makes iced coffee
with snow, which makes everybody
sick.
Hardly pausing to recover his
breath, he is back in London, then off
to South Africa with Armand and
Michaela Dennis, chasing zebras in a
truck and catching them with a noose.
They also caught a buffalo, which,
when it decided to escape from theirut
in which they had imprisoned it, just
put its head down and charged through
the wall.
Still with the Dennises, Stobart is
next seen landing at Darwin —“a fair
cow,” as somebody obligingly des-
cribed it for him —and so to the mouth
of the Staten River to catch crocodiles.
They didn’t get any crocs., though
they saw a few, but they did catch a
5001 b. groper, and Stobart caught
atiKsbse in the liver, which, so he says,
the doctors up north were unable to
diagnose.
And so, still weak from his illness,
to Everest to make the film of Sir
John Hunt's expedition; and, in his
notes, and particularly in his photo-
graphs emphasising die steepness of
that mighty mountain, adding a little
to the familiar story.
The Tower
In Seven In the Tower (Faber)
Louise Collis, daughter of Maurice
Collis, history’s Dior, who takes old
times and dresses them up in full
period-costume, uses her father’s tech-
nique on the Tower of London, first
with a study of the tower, and next
with the oft-told stories of seven of its
most celebrated inmates: the two
princes murdered by Richard 111,
Perkin Warbeck, Anne Boleyn, Lady
lane Grey, Sir Walter Raleigh, the
Gunpowder Plotters and the Duke of
Monmouth.
She is most refreshingly like her
father in her treatment of the little
princes, Perkin Warbeck, and especially
the Guy Fawkes plot.
In this last—with its occupation of
a house next to the House of Lords
from which to burrow into the Parlia-
mentaiy cellars; the vacation of it
because Royalty wanted it for an
Ambassador; its resumption; the diffi-
culty of cutting through walls three
yards wide; the discovery that their
next-door neighbor was going away,
and that his cellar was directly under
the throne of the House of Lords; the
postponement of the plot for a summer
because the Parliament had risen; the
refusal of most who heard Monteagle
read out the wildly-spelt warning at his
dinner-table to believe that it was other
than a “frenzie or sporte”; the refusal,
on the other hand, of Catesby and his
friends to believe that they, in turn,
bad been betrayed Miss Collis
builds up something of the suspense
of a first-class thriller. Which, of
course, that story is, with a last-minute
gallop and a final stand in a house in
Staffordshire, and everything.
Second Thoughts: Michel Butor
(Faber). The Paris agent of an
Italian firm, on his way to Rome to
collect his mistress and bring her back
to Paris, suddenly realises on the train
that he doesn’t love her so much as
Rome and the freedom from family
worries he enjoys there, and that it
would be much better if he just kept
the girl in Rome and the family in
Paris and made the best of it. The
author sees enormous significance in
this decision. Billowing around this
skeleton of a story is an extravagantly
emotive account of the 24-hour rail-
journey—done, in the most aggressive
manner of experimental writing, in
the second-person —and a set of loose
and sometimes obscure flashbacks.
THE MAN FROM AHAMINABY
Hard to say where he came from —
Maybe the Great Divide
Where the sun like a golden raindrop
Rolls down Kiandra side,
Or down from Kelly’s high plains
With his pick-ajce over his shoulder
Or out of a hollow snow gum
Or out of a granite boulder —
Or,maybe he came from Bugtown,
That’s far enough out and further
Though there isn't any town at Bugtown
And there aren’t any bugs there either;
Anyway on his white horse
He rode down out of the hills,
His pick-axe over his shoulder,
His two black dogs at his heels.
—“A long way back to Kiandra,
Miles further than you’d think,
Where the mullock-heaps glint on the hill-
side
And the white snow-daisies wink;
A long way back to Kiandra
Over the blue sky’s brink
But here’s old Adaminaby
Where a man can get a drink.
Cool are the bar and the beer there,
And my old mates gathered round”. . .
— “You’ll wait a long time for a drink,
mate.
The blooming pub’s been drowned.”
—“Seen a high tide myself there,
The beer right up to our necks” . . .
— “She's sunk like a ship, we tell you,
With all the rest of the wrecks.
Where have you been these years
With your mare and your dogs and your
pick?
The whole town’s under the water,
Pise and stone and brick.
While you were sinking your shaft, mate,
Or shearing, was it, or droving,
They shut the old pub right down, mate,
They brought in early-closing.
The publican, more’s the pity,
Has finally lost his licence;
Chimney and shadowy door there
Drink to each other in silence.
Only the shag like a copper
Dives down to the window to peer;
Yabbies crawl over the counter,
Mud-eyes are into the beer.
At the bar door the bunyip
Lies down and scratches his fleas:
And a great wave of the Snowy
Says ‘Time, gentlemen, please .*
There s drink enough still of a kind, mate,
If your taste runs far as water,
It's over the cafe, too, mate,
It’s over the tallest poplar.
But the beer she’s off for ever
And so is Adaminaby,
It's all under water making
Hydroelectricity.”
—‘‘Hydroelectricity
Don’t make no sense to me
And there’s the whole town still standing
So far as I can see.
It runs right down to the farms there
Under the shining air
And pink the apple-trees bloom there,
Like a white cloud the pear.
She’s the old town as ever
And all my mates will remember me
When I go down as always
To drink in Adaminaby.”
— “She’s drowned, she’s gone, she’s
flooded !”
— “Ah, tell the marines,” he cried,
And called his black dogs to him
And spurred the white mare’s side
And rode on down the hillside
As he had done for years
And straight out under the water
And drank there with his peers.
