Sonnets of Singers
[The opening line of each of these son-
nets is by the subject of it, and is used
as a key-word for the other lines.]
I. —Siiakspeare.
“When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds,”
Olympian in his vision and his strength,
A sudden breeze of truth stirs through the
crowds
That jostle in the swift procession’s length
Down all the roads from youth to heavy age.
The royal pomp of gold-and-purple sings
Is naked manhood on his sunlit stage ;
And words made sharp with keen imagin-
ings
Pierce to the heart of motive and desire.
Ah, king above the kings, your retinue
Flashes with jewel lights and singing fire
Through druid forests wet with upland
dew
And colored cities passionate with tears
To crown you with the dreams of all the
years!
II. —Milton.
“Hurled headlong, flaming from the etherial
sky,”
The thunderous torrent of his music falls
In ever-echoing cadence; and the high
Immutable clear voice triumphant calls,
Sonorous as blown silver, through the deep.
And now the last reverberations fail;
The flutes breathe warmly and the shrill
reeds weep
A long -star-music exquisite and frail. '
■ The beaten timbrel leads the shepherd dance;
And every vale in England’s Arcady
Becomes a Grecian meadow, while romance
Drinks at some fount of ancient
memory....
A summer wind that sings in pines austere,
Spendthrift as ages writing one rich year!
III. —Burns.
“The toil-worn cottar frae his labor goes,”
Eased by the burden of a simple song
That, lilting heedless as the wind that blows,
Has held his heart of hearts the whole
day long
And makes his step the lighter at the end.
The lark goes circling up the yellow' sky,
The happy rushes in the meadow bend,
The drunken pedlar in his rags limps by,
And Tam o’ Shunter spurs his good grey
mare.
Sw r eet. laughing women with red lips to
kiss,
Mean folly whipped with scorn like keen
Scotch air—-
Melodious truth sang these; and could
not miss,
Through village lights and ale-house jests,
the plan
Of the world-circle in the soul of man.
IV. —Coleridge,
“Down the green, hill athwart a cedarn
cover”
Goes the strange piper making colored
rhymes.
Light is the youthful step of this world-,
lover,
Blowing on antique bronze a thought that
chimes
To echoes of dim nights bewitched with
wonder.
. Now on a mountain crag he takes his
stand.
His voice is as the wind that brings the
thunder;
And with the rebel bugle in his hand
He shrills the long, high call of liberty.
But by the haven there are quiet places,
Slow waters and blue haunts of memory,
With wrinkles of sea-care on old stooped
faces
That lighten redly as the low hearth
gleams—
Oh, ancient mariner, forlorn of dreams!
V. —Shelley. '
“There was a poet whose untimely tomb”
The young, fresh seasons wept in sunlit
rain.
Ah, spirit dying in the falling bloom !
Was it his note that filled the winds again?
Did we hear singing in that Caspian cave
; Dow at the foot of Caucasus, where yet
The white foam flies before the breaking
‘ wave
Bearing all Asia’s sighs of lost regret?
There is a poet , who is kin to all
The sweetness of the earth and sea and
sky !'
The springtime of his breath is in the call
That leaves the littleness of things that
die
And fills the valleys of the deathless air
Till the will wonders what the soul may dare.
VI. ICeats.
“Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn,”
Of flowery tales told by some spreading
tree *
When magic walked with wonder in the
morn
And tremulous music stirred in Thessaly
He knew, as poppies dreaming in the wheat
Know the blue summer and the trilling
bird.
Ills thought’s full petal lifted to the sweet
Warm light and movement of the perfect
word:
And in the ecstasy of all dear things
lie made a melody of truth and time
That drew him up above the dust of wings
By fragrant airs and sweeps of silver
rhyme-—
His pageant cymbals and his lonely fife
Lead on to that high beauty that is life.
VII. —Tennyson.
“Tears from the depth of some divine de-
spair” ' ,
Were in the muted rapture of a song
That mixed the common earth with finer air;
But;.when he willed, great notes grown
With tin 1 full soul of all the classic host
Blew his adventurous shit) of fair romance
To hays and inlets of that elfin coast
Where Virgil’s Italy and iilied France
Met under - British oaks and Grecian skies
To trumpets blown and clash of knightly
steel.
Merlin of strange, uncertain steps, but wise
In the large wisdom that has power to
heal,
Your feet were clay, your brows were bound
with fire
Of the great stars that sing a world’s desire.

DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
History in Khaki
The Story of Ansa’c, which is the first
of the 12 volumes that are to appear about
Australia’s part in the Great War, has been
published by Angus and Robertson, of Syd-
ney. It reveals a touch of genius in the
discoverer of Charles Bean. For four years
Australia knew Bean as a war correspon-
dent who was as good as the censors would
let him be. Marly in 1915 he wrote, under
orders, of the indiscipline which was damag-
ing the reputation of the A.I.F. in Cairo,
and for a while he was.one of the most
unpopular men in the force. His personal
bravery and evident zeal soon rehabilitated
him. Yet at no time did he strike the rank
and file of the A.I.F. as either better or
worse than the skilled writers who were
dealing with other efforts on other fronts,
lie was just a journalist who knew his job.
lie is disclosed in this book as curiously
different in method and temperament from
his contemporaries who have succeeded in.
the attempt to picture phases of the Great
War: and from the Australian point of
view all the differences are in his favor.
He does not. persistently mount Pegasus,
like lan Hamilton: or linger to castigate
nonentities, like Gibbs; or cause the read-
er’s flesh to creep with tales of mvstery and
imagination, like Ashmead Bartlett. He
doe_s not strive after purple patches, and his
reticence is remarkable. Tie is describing
one of the wickedest tragedies in history,
a tragedy in which many of his intimate
friends were sacrificed, yet rarely does he
allow passion to show through the ordered
fabric of his narrative. He is there to per-
form a duty as efficiently as possible, with-
out unphilosophic resentment and without
needlessly obtruding his own personality
into the affair. In short, Bean writes in
much the same stoic spirit as that in which'
the men he so admires fought. There are
no polished buttons or emu’s feathers about
his story : it wears battle-dress throughout.
How necessary it was that he should cut
out the decorative speculations which former
toilers in this class of vineyard have allowed
themselves is shown by the fact that, even
under the restrained system he has adopted,
the work runs to 600 closely-printed pages
—say, 200,000 words. Never was one in
his position offered such a mass of docu-
mented information to work on. Beginning
with the cipher message of July 30, 1914,
which virtually told the Fisher Government
that war with Germany was certain, he is
able to go minutely into every notable de-
tail of Australia’s activities at home, in
Egypt and on Gallipoli till the end of April,
1915.
It is an astonishing tribute to the far-
sightedness of General Bridges that in the
complacent days when people were talking
of marching to Berlin within a month or so
and there dictating terms of peace—at a
time when England itself had never known
what it was to send as much as a full divi-
sion overseas on the first outbreak ,of
a war—this soldier, 12,000 miles from
the main seat of the conflict, should have,
made his plans for a second and perhaps
a third Australian division. Meanwhile, he
gathered round him a staff as able, pro-
bably, as any divisional commander ever
had to begin a campaign with —men such
as White, Glasfurd, Gellibrand and Ilowse
—and an incomparable lot of regimental
officers. The miserable sentiment which had
fought the R.A.N. to the last ditch was
abroad at the time, and Bridges and his
right-hand men were viewed with suspicion
by many, while the -opinion was freely ex-
pressed that, to get the best results out of
the other ranks, company commanders and
even subalterns would have to be imported
from England. This theory was probably
the origin of a lie persisted in for years,
viz., that part of the blame for the initial
failure at' Anzac —a failure which, in a
sense, vitiated the whole campaign—was due
to the conduct of the Austra-
lians in overrunning their objective, and
that this was due to the incompetence bf
their officers. Bean gives the slander its
quietus :• —■
So far from overshooting their objective the Austra-
lian troops did not reach it, despite their gallant
and enduring effort to do so. Disordered by their
landing'in country entirely different from that which
had been described to them, and with the plans set
for them torn to shreds by the swift modifications
which their leaders were forced to make, officers and
men pressed on towards whatever points they knew —•
or whatever were said—to be their objectives. Such
rough organisation as was learnt in the Mena days,
so much of the earnestly practised methods as was
possible in their haste, they adopted. Constantly
under heavy fire, the drill learned in the desert
was conscientiously applied. Good order was by
no means possible. But with all the faith and
fiery manhood that was in them, men and officers
were striving to carry out their task. .. .Swiftly
though the Australians advanced, it is probable that
only two parties of them, those under Tulloch and
Loutit, hurrying over country only passable for strong
and fit men. actually reached their objective. None
ever went beyond it.
Glittering names appear in guises that
seem strange to-day. Major Black, D. 5.0.,
D.C.M., wlio fell leading liis men at Bulle-
oourt, is here —Lance-corporal Percy Black
of a machine-gun crew! His “number two”
is Private Harry Murray—later Lieut.-
Oolonel Murray, V.C., C.M.G., D. 5.0., etc.
But thev are merely mentioned in passing.
The only eminent fighting men dealt with in
detail are those who were eminent on the
Peninsula. Bean is no hero-worshipper,
though he profoundly admires many of those
whom he met under such devastatinglv test-
ing circumstances. One of the most attrac-
tive pictures he paints is of White
When great folk came to Australian headquarters
White was always in the background. His name
was seldom heard. Vet in the height of. his influ-
ence, during the dreadful winter of 1916 in France,
there was not an activity in the Australian force
which he did not control. During that time when
the difficulties of the A.I.F. were greatest and its

PINRETTES
FOR CONSTIPATION
Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been
expelled from the body-are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettes, the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do ; and
they do not wear out in their effects.
Taken according to directions they
assist the patient so that the use of
an opening medicine is not a con-
stant necessity.

Savage with the years,
And I crave for rest:
I shall seek the tide to-night,
Curse the world, and quench my light
Thus and thus the fool said,
Sick of feuds and fears,
As it tossed the pallid dead,
Sick of feuds and fears,
On its heaving breast,
“Tainted are my waters clean
With this thing, so foul and mean” —
Thus and thus the tide said,
Washing through the piers.

BRIGALOW.
The Slave.
Rosy with henna are her finger-tips.
Beneath the beauty of her pencilled brows
Her eyes are dark and lustrous. Red her
lips
As the poinsettia bloom. Her little feet
Bear jewelled anklets. In her dusky hair
The women weave pale blossoms frail and
sweet, ' .
With soft words tell her she is very fair.
Dress her in silk and gauze, bring milky
white
Pearls to adorn her brow and slender neck,
Her round young arms with gold and jewels
deck, , „ . ,
To make her lovely for their lord s delight.
But, ah, the sorrow in the trembling mouth,
The passionate pleading in the piteous
eyes !
A prison is this palace in the south.
Lissom and tall, among her native snows,
A sweet white flower of innocence was she.
The flower will wither when the monsoon
blows,
And drumming rains beat down continu-
ously. .
Her little head will droop. The pitiless
heat
Will dim the lustre of her lovely eyes_;
Alone, and longing for the northern skies,
Languid and slow, she’ll pass on listless
feet.
And she will dream of dewy mountain
flowers,
Finding no pleasure in her sparkling gems,
And she will hunger for the long, sweet hours
Upon the uplands. A reluctant queen,
Her rich robes mock her deep unhappiness.
Some shepherd’s tender love she might
have been,
Content and happy in her homespun dress.
But soon the arm of kindly brother Death
Will rescue her. His touch will smooth her
brow,
And still the heart that beats so quickly now,
And close her eyes, and hush her sobbing
breath.

Love’s Penitence.
Tney whispered scandal things. Of course
' —such things the Fates decree!
But maybe, dear, they wished they were as
happy as were we—
As careless of the orthodox, and just as
fancy-free!
They whispered things that burst our ears,
and yours were sweetly pink—
Pinker than all pink roses are; pinker than
dawns, I think;
Pinker than shells that open wide along the
ocean’s brink.
They whispered scandal things—yes, scores;
'but old and sour and grey
Were those who scandalised us as we walked
the sweetheart way,
Reckless of all to-morrows, and forgetting
yesterday.
They mapped the roads of rectitude —the
roads that stretch ahead,
As straight as arrows, to their goal from
where all joy has fled,
Where once-bright eyes are lustreless, and
lips no longer red.
They scheduled out the resting-seats—those
old seats archly prim ;
But we preferred the winding roads along
the river’s rim—
The roads that are the sweeter when the
daylight waxes dim.
They droned the precepts orthodox evolved
from fretted years,
Planned in their caution’s careful mould by
falterings and by fears;
But only music of our joy re-echoed in our
ears.
Each day was but a day for them —a day
and nothing more;
A dozen hours of custom. But our days
held each a score
Of hours of life —and plus the sum of all
the days before!
They said and said —but what they said
was not for us to heed :
The doctrines that drab dullness drones are
not what lovers need :
Its codes are foolish brakes upon Love’s
charioteering speed.
They whispered, and they hinted, and they
made it rudely plain
That all our hopes of Paradise in after life
■were vain....
But, dear one. now we’re sorry that we
can’t so sin again !

THE INTERNATIONALIST JEKYLL
AND THE CAPITALIST HYDE.
“Mr. Poyxton : If Australia were invaded, would
you fight?
“Mr. Considine : That would depend upon the
circumstances. Working men of any color are to
me equal, but if any nation came to take Australia
from the workers I would be with the working men.
I would fight when Australia belonged to the
workers, not before.’'
This, from the proceedings in the House of
Representatives, sounds very democratic and
humanitarian, and as an election-meeting
argument, in a centre where feeling against
the bloated possessor of what everybody else
is after runs high, it invariably proves a
smasher. The picture which the orator de-
sires to present is that of a strong, stern,
altruistic character conducting a game fight
against a social system which is intolerable
in its rottenness. The attitude is not new.
All through the ages people who believed
that their fellow-men were on the wrong
track ethically, spiritually or industrially—
believed it, that is to say, with their whole
souls—have testified to their convictions in
the only w r ay that wins disciples in the long
run. Retiring to spots devoid of the com-
forts inseparable from the capitalist system
—to the tops of pillars, the depths of caves
and so forth —they have lived frugally on a
few herbs washed down with an occasional
cup of water. If the solitary life did not
appeal to them they formed communities;
and from the Catacombs to Paraguay the
principle on which they began was the same.
Those who had divided their all amongst the
less fortunate. Such sincerity could not
avoid gaining converts, and if it had been
persisted in by the majority anywhere the
industrial and every other sort of millen-
nium would be with us now.
Mr. Considine has not attempted either
of these convincing though trying methods
of proving his scorn of the capitalistic State.
He is an M.P. drawing £lOOO a year out
of the pockets of capitalists. The latter, so
far as 40 per cent, of his income is con-
cerned, did not even contract to pay it to
him when he was elected: it is virtually
money stolen from the working classes in
the form of increased prices for their neces-
saries. He battens further on the workers
by travelling as a deadhead on their rail-
ways and tramways. Every suit of clothes,
every pair of boots he buys gives Capitalism
another lift. The water that he uses comes
out of capitalistic reservoirs, and he would
die. or, at any rate, contract serious ill-
nesses, if he refrained from participation
in the sanitary services of Capitalism. When
he goes to a theatre, picture-show or other
entertainment he helps to perpetuate the
present social system, and similarly when he
has a meal in a restaurant, or a drink, or
a shave or haircut, or a smoke. If he
divides his surplus cash, or any of it,
amongst those who do not earn the equiva-
lent of about £l5OO a year by belonging to
the most luxurious club in Melbourne, he
has been wronged to the extent that the
public is in ignorance of his consistency as
a Friend of Man. If he does not it may
be assumed that he invests it. If he has
been investing ever since he first started to
do well, financially, as a politician, he should
hay e a tidy little fortune to his credit. And
if it is in, say, the C.S.R., who is going to
blame him? If the cash is not to be distri-
buted amongst the needy and the suffering,
why should it not be put where it is safe
and likely to show a good return? Indeed
since Mr. Considine takes full advantage of
the amenities of the capitalistic State in other
directions, it would be illogical on his part if
he jibbed at associating himself with a Trust.
He refused to fight in the late war, and he
has no intention of fighting in anv war until
Australia “belongs to the workers.” It is
a gambit that the dullest can handle. Every
peacp-time soldier who played for safety
during the recent fighting knew it. They
refused to serve unless they were given
safe “jobs”: Mr. Considine refuses to
serve, unless an even more difficult conces-
sion is made. Meanwhile, like the commis-
sioned shirkers, of whom he and his friends
spoke with such contempt while the war
was on, he has no objection to reaping the
fruits of the victory he did nothing to win.
it others had followed his example he would
not iJ 3 .® drawing £lOOO a year and enjoying
an M s.P. many perquisites and privileges.
His savings would be in the hands of a
Herman administration. He would not be
talking politics for a living: lie would be
working.
* * *
One who has displayed such shrewdness
thioughout his public life, or, as the capitalist
in his materialistic fashion would put it, lias
shown such a sharp eye for the main chance,
is not likely to have overlooked the fact that
nothing in this life turns out quite as well
as might be expected. Britain declared for
breetrade, which was to make living cheap
and everybody happy. By the time the
Hreat War arrived two-thirds of the nation’s
rood was sea-borne; also three-quarters of
its wool and about half its iron. To safe-
guard the routes over which these and other
necessaries came a monstrous fleet had to be
supported, which ate up a good deal more
than the money saved by the purchase of
cheap imports; industries wilted before
foreign competition and unemployment was
created; and in 1917 the development of the
submarine campaign nearly caused the
nation’s defeat by starvation. The Hughes
Government was afraid to impose conscrip-
tion in Australia, and of course the electors
turned it down. Whereupon a despised class
known to the French as embusques crowded
here from England, America and the Euro-
pean Continent, and many of these worst of
immigrants are with us still: boys of 15 and
men of 50 enlisted, as well as many invalids
who cost the country more than they were
worth; the A.I.F. battalions fell below
strength, and men who should have been rest-
ing were sent over and- over again into the
line. Or, again, a 44-hour week is introduced.
In theory the men should work harder. Wages
go to 905., to 1055., to 120 s. In theory the
workers should he better off. In fact produc-
tion is decreasing and the workers have to
pay so much more for their needs that they
are poorer than before. Furthermore, the
new arrangement has blanketed great indus-
tries such as the steel business; and those
formerly employed in it are either out of
work or competing for billets in other direc-
tions. The man who introduced rabbits to
Australia meant well; and the people who
in different lands have wiped out egrets and
gulls did not realise till too late that they
were creating plagues of caterpillars and
locusts.
* * * *
The internationalist experiment is likely
to involve indirect results of a more disas-
trous sort to the vast majority of whites, and
especially white working men, than any of
those mentioned above, or than any of the
thousands that might be added to them.
America welcomed African blacks, and now
has a miscegenation problem that threatens
within less than a century to turn the
U.S.A. into a nation of half-breeds. In the
meantime there are assaults on white women
and lynch law. Any Australian worker can
get a foretaste of what his lot would be with
no anti-alien laws by trying to farm in com-
petition with Indians or Egyptians in their
own countries; or by taking his labor to
China, where the standard of living is .so low
as to exclude Japanese coolies; or even to
Japan, where about 6d. of our money is to
be earned ner hour for work done under con-
ditions of incredible insanitation and dis-
comfort. The welcomed yellow races would
bring here their diseases and their habits,
their diversions and their vices—no worse
than our own, perhaps, but so different as to
be unassimilable. They would share our
trains, trams and hotels, marry our women,
and first assist in our government, and then,
by weight of . numbers, control it. They
might be working men when they arrived, but
they would be Asiatic all the time. What
idiocy it is to argue that such an invasion
could be anything but the curse to the
workers of Australia that America’s negro
problem is to the U.S. workers and that the
Japanese problem is becoming to Canada!
Because he is not in the dark on this ques-
tion, the theoretically CHRisT-like Consi-
dine is no more a practical internationalist
than he is a practical communist. He has
never done a thing for his colored brother
but talk about him in an admiring manner.
In fact, he is in much the same category as
those imperialists who folded up their flags
the moment the Empire was in real peril
and were no more heard of till the danger
was past. As in their case, his motto is
the maximum of cheap advertisement with
the minimum of risk. Consiuine, as an
individual is, of course, not worth notice ; but
as a type of impostor who is to be found,
using slightly different methods, in all the
political camps, he more than repays study.
KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE.
A round-table conference has sat and com-
muned and dispersed in Sydney over the ques-
tion of lack of employment. There were
nine representatives of the employing class
and they had some ideas, but not enough, and
most or tnose they ventured to put torward
were plain stodge. Titus one, in a moment
of supreme daring, said “he would like to
see ail Uovernments stop borrowing for a
while, but they could not do that.” Yet the
Governments wilt nave to do it some day,
whether they can or not, and it might lie
more sensible to anticipate the inevitable pro-
hibition. The stoppage of loans would of
itself supply work of the continuous and
self-supporting kind, as distinguisned from
tne bunding of non-seif-supporting works
which employ 1000 men this month and have
no more use for them next half-year, the job
being finished and added to tlie perpetual
losers. For loans being stopped and necessity
being the step-mother of invention, the com-
munity would cease to farm out to the out-
sider many of its clothes-making and
machine-making and other jobs, simply
because it would lack the loan money
to pay for them. And in a rough-and-
ready but very positive way tliat would sup-
ply a great deal of payable occupation. If,
thanks to the poisonous methods of discour-
aging apprenticeship and gilding the lot of
the odd-job boy with an expert man’s pay,
the necessary artisans weren’t here, they
would come here ; and the young Australian
would have to turn over a new leaf and
learn. But the nine employers’ represen-
tatives at the round-table conference being
too timid or too stodgy, the question of sub-
stituting work for lOU’s wasn’t pushed.
Then there .were nine representatives of
the “workers,” two of them being an inevit-
able pair who have never been accused of
any kind of productive work unless the re-
tailing of the second-hand theories of Kari.
Marx, himself no worker, can be reckoned
to them for horny-handedness. This section
of the conference never alluded to work at
all- —certainly not to the doing of more work.
Still less did its members allude to economy,
to the founding of new industries, to self-
dependence, or to anything else that was con-
crete. And in the chair, swinging the
casting vote, was a well-known clergyman.
He w r as permeated, doubtless, with the Ser-
mon on the Mount; but the Sermon was
before machinery, public debt, deficits, trades
unions or the dreadful problem of raising
the money to pay for an excess of imports;
also it was anterior to depreciated paper
money, exchange problems, or the easy, sin-
ful dodge of putting the unemployed and
the unemployable on to public works in order
to buy their votes. So chairman wasn’t
a helpful or practical item either.
When the round table really got into its
stride it was decided on the votes of the
employers’ section, aided by the clergyman,
that the State should supply some work by
spending loan money on sewerage schemes.
These were described as “revenue producing”
and they are in the sense that people are
taxed to pay for the use of sewers. But
when the sewer is finished, which is very
soon, the unemployed problem is as bad as
ever. The work is ended very quickly, but
the debt, when the game is played according
to Australian rules, is a burden for ever.
Even a million sewers based on a million
loans wouldn’t alter Australia’s monster
problem bv a hair’s breadth, that problem
being mainly that Australia produces so few
of the things made by skilled labor that it
has to import far too much. In addition to
the sewerage-loan scheme the employers’
representatives and the chairman carried
proposals for the making of more loan rail-
ways, to be a burden on the people for want
of population to use them; for water conser-
vation ; for the destruction of timber on
State lands. They are all onen to the same
objections as the sewerage proposition. There
is no permanency about them. The work
comes to an end and the snectre of unem-
ployment is back at the old address. It
returns like the blackmailer \ ho won’t stay
bou°'ht, or like the Danes whom Etjielred
used to pay to go away. Further, such jobs
teach nothing. Very often they produce
nothing and they never produce much. They
leave insufferable debts to posterity. They
bring no valuable new population to the
country. And they don’t reduce by one boot-
lace, or one yard of calico, or one ounce of
snuff, Australia’s dependence on foreign
suppliers for the things that give it a right
to call itself civilised.
* * * *
The nine Labor members of the Confer-
ence, including the two who don’t labor,
opposed the loan sewerage, loan railway,
loan water conservation and loan tree-de-
struction remedies for unemployment, be-
cause they were too mild, not because they
were too futile and bubbly. The Labbrites
wanted rather to stand -civilisation on its
head, and tear all its clothes off, and empty
its pockets, and buy maddening drugs and
fireworks with the money. They aimed at
revolution : and only when their unanimous
vote failed for lack of the support of the
clerical chairman did they fall into line
with the loan propositions. Their “scheme”
was a wonderful farrago of nonsense; yet
the Labor section of the round tnble swal-
lowed the gibberish whole. It set forth that
“the responsibility for unemployment shall
be borne by the industry.” But under the
policy of loan-mongering and drift, very
many perhaps most —-or the unemployed
never had and never will have any
definite industry except odd-jobbing or
asking the Government to find a pre-
tence of work for them. Then the
organised workers” were to "proceed to tue
issue of credits.” But there is always the
question of who will give the credit; also
the question of who will pay the credit in
cash when the debt falls due. The whole
financial edilice is suggestive of that house
called Nowhere, which consisted of one miss-
mg room and a broken window, and was
built by Nemo, dealer in Unreal and Imag-
inary Estate. The "credits” which are to
be opened (but about the shutting of which
s° little is said) are to be sufficient to
absorb the bulk of surplus prime necessi-
ties. And when "further credits” have
been ‘ opened” and every able-bodied person
has given "his. due quota of work to society”
the hours of industry are to be reduced to
make production less, and wages are to be
raised to make the cost of production more,
and profit is to be abolished —which will be
easy, for it will abolish itself. But loss
won t be abolished; it will take possession
of everything and be all over the place like
rabbits or prickly-pear.
*. * * *
Dismissing all this nonsense, the hard
truth is that there is no lack of employment
in Australia—none whatever. There is
more work waiting to be done than three
times as many people could do. There is
only lack of employment on impossible
terms and conditions; and the duty of the
employers in every round-table conference
or other body is to make this quite plain.
The mining industry of the Commonwealth
is easily capable of employing 50,000 men.
But hardly a silver, lead, zinc, copper or
tm mine is being worked ; and the few that
are being worked are having their eyes
picked out to support the unnatural condi-
tions, and this means prejudicing the whole
future of the industry. Thousands of agri-
cultural farms are going out of cultivation
because of the absurd demands of the men
who are required to work them. Hundreds
of gardens are overgrown with weeds for
the same reason. Three days ago Tiie
Bulletin received from a manufacturing
stationer a letter to the effect that he could
no longer use an Australian article in his
work because the price had gone beyond
him. What we are suffering from mostly
is a cowardly evasion of the truth; and
there is no hope for us until it is told and
weak subterfuges are abandoned.
THE CONSCRIPTION OF COCKY.
Wheat-growing is a gamble everywhere,
but in no country where it is one ot tne chief
industries is it more liazardous than m JN.
Wales. Tne dominant teature ot tUe busi-
ness there is its weird uncertainty. Some-
times tlie farmer gets a crop; sometimes (as
in 1916 and 19191 he doesn’t. Sometimes
tne price is profitable (it was last year) ;
sometimes (in 191(5, for instance) it isn’t.
If tire grain is grown near rue Victorian
border ir is liable to be grabbed by tne Syd-
ney Government at 2o per ■ cent, less tnan
can be got for it beyond the Murray. That
happened in 1914. And when the Adminis-
tration commandeers tne stun it accepts no
responsibility for loss or damage resulting
from the negligence of its servants. Jiiven
when millions of bushels thus acquired are
shown to have been recklessly v'ven over to
tne mice and weevils, and the Government
is momentarily shamed into undertaking to
pay compensation—half a million sterling
was promised to the owners of ruined war
wneat —tne pledge is gaily dishonored. in-
deed, the caprices of politicians are more
trying to the cocky than the caprices of
.Nature. By fallotving and other expedients
he can provide to some extent against the
vagaries of climate, but there is no way of
insuring against the levity and perfidy of
elected persons. He never knows what they
are going to do next.
The war lowered the status of our bold
peasantry, its country’s pride. It was sub-
jected to an irksome form of industrial con-
scription. Its produce was seized and sold
—where it wasn’t destroyed or stolen —re-
gardless of its feelings. The right of
property in • “essential commodities’’ like
wheat was directly assailed. Such measures
could only have been justified by an emer-
gency like the war, and should have disap-
peared with it. But except in Victoria and
S. Australia, where Liberal Governments are
in office, the politicians are loth to let them
go. Alwavs greedy for power, they revel
in the new field of operations which the con-
trol of Cocky’s wheat has given them, and
will not relinquish it without a struggle.
The spirit which informed the compulsory
pools was preserved and intensified in the
Dooley Wheat Marketing Bill, which was
rushed through the N. S. Wales Assembly
in the Dooley way. In this extraordinary
piece of legislation private property in wheat
was incontinently abolished. Clause 6 set
forth that, on the publication of a notice in
the Government Gazette, the ownership of
all the wheat garnered in N. S. Wales passed
to the Crown, the grower’s interest in it
becoming merely a claim for compensation
under the Act. A verbal assurance was
given by the Minister of Agriculture that the
former proprietor would get a first payment
of 3s. a bushel on delivery of the goods at
the railway siding, or on January 25—it
wasn’t clear which. But if the Govern-
ment didn’t come down with the money on
the due date (it didn’t with the 2s. od. a
bushel guaranteed on delivery of the 1920-21
w'heat) the farmer would have no redress, his
legal rights having been taken away. It was
proposed to reconstitute the present W T heat
Board, which consists of a Labor M.L.C., a
member of the A.W.U. and two delegates
from farmers’ organisations, with Dunn,
the Minister, as chairman. This remark-
able tribunal, on which the representatives
of the men who grew the wheat would be
consistently outvoted by the representatives
of their employees, was to be armed with all
the powers of the King, who can do no wrong.
Sub-clause 3 of clause 11 set forth that
“compensation for any wheat acquired under
this Act shall be paid in such instalments
and at such times and on such terms and
conditions and in such manner as the Board
may determine.” In addition to this Ivath-

leen Mavoubneen provision, the Board was
to be authorised to enter into what shipping
and selling contracts it pleased, to pay vyfiat-
over it lilted to the handling gangs and the
unsuccessful Labor candidates who expected
appointments as country agents and to fix
such a local price as would giatity the de
maud of the metropolitan union officials for
cheap bread. * * *
Bv way of preparing the hardy agricultu-
rist for what was in store for him, the Govern-
ment rushed eraily into contracts and things
of that sort. A magnificent chartering and
selling monopoly was presented to Dalgety
and Co. It was arranged that one lot of
wheat-shifters should get 3d. an hour, and
another lot Is. (id. per 100 bags, above
award rates. The A.WiTJ. was also encour-
aged to demand £4 10s. a week and keep
for drivers of stripper-harvesters and reaper-
threshers, £5 2s. a week and keep for cooks,
and £4 Is. a week and keep for bag-sewers,
together with “travelling time one way, four
paid holidays or double pay instead, and
50 per cent, extra for all time worked in
excess of 48 hours a week. And although
the Australian banks fought shy of the
scheme a financial arrangement alleged
to be satisfactory (they always are) was
made with the London and W estminster
Bank. Such was the position when the
Leg. Council astonished the Government
and deranged the plans of the A.W.U.
and the cheap-bread-and-damn-the-farmer
section of the Labor Caucus by heaving the
measure out. It did so largely on the assu-
rance of A. K. Tketiiowan and other repre-
sentatives of the agricultural interest (1)
that the farmers were almost unanimously
ojjposed to the bill, (2) that they hadn’t
been consulted before it was drafted, and
(3) that, the war being over, it would be
the last word in iniquity to grab the pro-
duce of their year’s labor and hand it over
to the tender mercies of a political Board
responsible, net to those whose property,
they would be dealing with, but to unions
V’hose aim as employees would be to get
the maximum out of the pool and as cus-
tomers to put the minimum in. These are
incontrovertible propositions. All the evi-
dence shows that the farmers want either
to be left alone or, failing that, a voluntary
pool controlled by their co-operative organ-
isations (the Hughes Government has guar-
anteed a first payment of 3s. a bushel) ;
and as citizens of a free Commonwealth
they are entitled to the pool they want and
are entitled to be protected from the pool they
don’t want. This conscription of the cocky’s
labor by a tribe of politicians who profess to
loathe conscription in every shane and form
has gone far enough. Instead of “putting
the gun’’ into him a bit more, a really demo-
cratic Government would free him from the
degrading servitude of which he has been
the victim for the last six years, and restore
to him the right of selling the fruits of his
industry in the way most congenial to him.
With wheat quoted at 99 cents a bushel in
the Chicago pit, and an expected slump of
17,000,000 bushels in the N. S. Wales har-
vest, he is going to have a worrying time,
whatever happens. But a compulsory pool
of the Dooley sort run by irresponsible
Labor politicians in the interests of the
A.W.U. and the cheap-bread section in the
Bier City would be more than the poor
devil could endure.
THE NATIONALISM OF MYSIA AND
THE NATIONALISM OF HUGHES.
The Governor of Victoria journeyed to
Mysia, which is 1(50 miles from Melbourne,
last week to open a school. The odd thing
about Mysia is that it feels the same in
regard to the Diggers to-day as it did during
the war. Its population, according to the
latest official figures, is only 216. Yet it
has helped to repatriate all its returned
soldiers, with the result that there is not
an ex-Digger or the dependant of one in
necessitous circumstances throughout a dis-
trict in which practically every eligible
volunteered; and it has raised by public
subscription the astonishing sum of £6OO
for a war-memorial. This money has been
added to the Education Department’s grant
for the school above mentioned; and the
descendants of .the men who fought will be
reminded at the same time of the valor of
their forebears and the fidelity to their pro-
mises of those who stayed behind every time
they attend there. It is safe in the circum-
stances to prophesy that there will be few
shirkers amongst the young men of Mysia
next time Austi-alia is in trouble.
* * * *
The following Friday, in N. S. Wales,
was what some sardonic character in autho-
rity decided should be called “Warriors’
Day.” One of those too-familiar orgies _of
cadging was staged for an object which
would be superfluous if the Federal Govern-
ment, which has been living for years on
its Empire patriotism and its devotion to
the soldiers, possessed a fraction of the
decency evidenced by the inconspicuous folk
of Mysia. W. M. Hughes gave the move-
ment to raise £50,000 for unemployed and
destitute ex-soldiers a kick-off with the fol-
lowing unexampled piece of Chadbandism: —
I desire now to make a direct appeal to Austra-
lians who hold responsible positions in the com-
mercial, industrial and rural life of the Common-
wealth to honor the promises made to Australian
soldiers that they would not be forgotten on their
return to the homeland.
Every citizen in the Commonwealth should stand
by the soldier in this his hour of trial, as he for
five long years stood by Australia.
And he mentioned that “the Commonwealth
Government was opening the appeal with a
donation of £1000.” A thousand pounds!
Why, his Government, by the hands of its
Commission for the Reduction of War Pen-
sions, is every week wringing as much out
of the class that “Warriors’ Day” is in-
tended to help! There is only one redeem-
ing feature about the set policy which has
been adopted by Ministers in regard to the
soldiers—they are evidently ashamed of it.
On the day before public charity had to be
resorted to in N. S. Wales on behalf of the
once-worshipped fighting-men the Prime Min-
ister told Lamond in Parliament: —
In cases where returned soldiers occupying war
service homes had fallen into arrears, if the appli-
cant was in acute circumstances extended time for
payment was invariably granted. Before legal action
could be taken the authority of the Acting Commis-
sioner was necessary, and that was not given in
cases of genuine hardship.
And almost at that moment this message was
travelling over the wires from Brisbane to
the big dailies in the other States :
An order to eject a returned soldier, Edward
Jackson, from a war-service home at Newmarket,
Biisbane, was asked by James Loynes, Deputy Com
missioner, in the Summons Court, lne department
complained that Jackson had not paid any rent for
the past three months. Jackson, in admitting the
allegation, said he had a wife and four children,
tne youngest being four, who was an out-patient
of the Children’s hospital, he only had six months’
work in tne last two years since lie had been bacK
from the 1' rout.
Mr. Dean, P.M., regretfully told Jackson that he
had to administer the law as he found it. Eventu-
ally the magistrate decided to give the defendant
15 days to quit the house. The Departments repre-
sentative pressed for costs, 'the defendant protested,
saying he had no money. The magistrate allowed
£2 ss. 6d. costs, in default of payment within three
months the amount to be levied by execution.
The simple-minded inhabitant of places
like Mysia—and, fortunately for the future
of Australia, there are many more of them
than the actions of their Parliamentary re-
presentatives would suggest —is stupefied
when he comes across items like this in a
newspaper, or when he meets a desperately-
wounued man who has had his pension docked
on the ground that one with his disability is
fit for ordinary manual work; or when he
sees a T.B. case who has just been turned
adrift by the Kepat. owing to a suspicion
that his lungs were tainted before he went to
France. tie wishes he could hear the Min-
isterial explanation of what looks so like
criminal ingratitude and a cynical breach of
faith. Being the man he is he would not
be impressed if he got it. Mr. Hughes and
his supporters have better uses for the money
they take from the taxpayers than that of
applying it to the redemption of promises
made in the days when the Germans looked
like winning the war. In the first place,
every legislator must get his £lOOO a year
for, as the Age recently put it, “working for
a very few months, for a very fevfc hours, on
three days a week only.” The Taxation Depart-
ment is costing .times more for 1021-22
than it did for 1916-17. There are 2037 em-
ployees where there were 637. Joseph Cook
has just been appointed High Commissioner,
an office which was described bv his prede-
cessor as “a sinecure” and “utterly useless.’
When Andrew Fisher went to London there
were 30-odd employees in the High Commis-
sioner’s oflice, and their salaries were a little
over £BOOO per annum. Cook will have 90-
odd under him, with a salary-sheet of more
than £12,000 per annum. “Contingencies”
ran to only £l6 000 a year under Fisher ;
under Cook, after the interest of the mort-
gage on Australia House has been added, they
will be about £llO,OOO per annum. And this
sort of thing is going on, not in isolated spots,
but in every quarter where it is considered
desirable by’ the Executive to buy support or
reward a friend. Who can wonder that the
army of stone-broke Diggers is growing! The
Commonwealth Government is setting Aus-
tralia an example which is in every respect
the opposite of that which the adults of
Mysia have set to the younger generation in
their district. Meanwhile it is absurd, and
worse than absurd, to call “drives” such as
that which occurred in N. S. Wales last
week “Warriors’ Days” or by any such title.
They are Politicians’ Days; and every shilling
contributed by the public provides the Gov-
ernment with another excuse to divert revenue
that was intended to be applied to helping
the soldiers into the pockets of the political
friends and tools of William Morris
Hughes.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
It Is Up to Ulster.
For many months Australian papers of the
stamp of’the Argus and the S. -M. Herald
have argued (1) that Ireland has been
offered and has refused Dominion status, and
(2) that the 60 per cent. Unionist majority
in the “six counties” are no less Irish than
the Sinn Fein minority. A cable of last
week indicates the real position beyond
further argument. The fact emerges, in the
first place, that, as The Bulletin has been
saying for three years or more, the Sinn Fein
leaders are ready to jump at Dominion
status the moment it is offered them. The
best way for an Australian to appreciate
the very different thing that the Lloyd
George Government has dangled before them
is to imagine that the additional autono-
mous rights which the Sinn Fein leaders
require have been confiscated from the Com-
monwealth. That would mean the wiping-
out of the R.A.N. and our army. Another
A.I.F. would be an impossibility. In the
event of war our brigades would be incor-
porated in British divisions, and would
share their discipline—including, inciden-
tally, the death-penalty for “desertion,”
which in modern war is apt to mean shell-
shock. Australian industries would have to
compete on a Freetrade basis with those of
Glasgow and Birmingham, the natural re-
sult being that Australia would become what
Ireland, except in particularly favored
centres like Dublin and Belfast, was till
the war —a purely agricultural county. And
a section containing the best port and about
one-fifth of the population would be carved
out, a large proportion of the inhabitants in
populous counties or shires bitterly protest-
ing. Sinn Fein is evidently prepared to
accept a good deal less than Dominion status
(for example, it will no doubt abandon the
idea of an Irish fleet), and the Lloyd
George Government seems disposed to yield
on the fiscal point which has kept Ireland
poor for centuries. But:—
All politicians have abandoned hope that the
Ulster Cabinet intends to recede one iota from its
frequently-expressed hostility to any proposal for
amending Ulster’s position under the Home Rule Act.
We all know the party politician’s argument
in support of such a stand. It was used in
Australia in opposition to Federation, and
it w’as dragged out again to defeat the vari-
ous referendum proposals. If Ireland feder-
ates —so runs the argument—the Loyalist
State of Ulster will be menaced as the
Mother State of N. S. Wales w r as repre-
sented to be by the State Righters, as New
York was alleged to be in Alexander
Hamilton’s day. Ulster is supposed to be
threatened by the R.C’s. But on the autho-
rity of G. B. Birmingham (who is an
Anglican cleric) the Protestants and R.C.’s.
get on extremely well under normal condi-
tions in the South and West, where the
latter are in a 90 per cent, majority.
The blackest feature of the Irish negotia-
tions is, and has been throughout, that the
crowd who are best known as Carsonites,
and who have their headquarters in Bel-
fast, have no desire to live at peace with
the Catholic Irish, and are as devoid of
Irish nationalist sentiment as an absentee
Australian of a common type is devoid of
Australian sentiment. They are sojourners
for profit, place or pay in a strange land
inhabited largely by people who they con-
sider should be boiled. Their policies have
been framed in the past, not with an eye to
the good of the greatest number in Ireland,
but, it has sometimes seemed, with the object
of exasperating the greatest number. That
is the spirit that killed one Gladstonian
effort towards peace after another and
nearly led to civil war in 1914. If Lloyd
George is capable of exorcising it he is such
a magician as English history has not here-
tofore known.
Our Own Shirt.
There are cheap substitutes for wheat and
maize and potatoes, and sheep meat is a
substitute for cow meat, and fish is a par-
tial substitute for both. But no substitute
has been found for cotton, because it is itself
the cheapest thing going in its line. There
is no more economical covering known ex-
cept the blush of modesty, and that laclis
the durable quality. let cotton isn’t a
drug in the market, for there are so inanv
places where it doesn’t grow, and there is so
much human being to cover. In fact, a while
ago a panic arose lest the United States should
oner to supply cotton goods but no more raw
material, and so shut up half the factories
of the rest of the world. Britain was largely
involved, and still remembered the horrors
of one Cotton Famine; so a strenuous ap-
peal was made to people through the far-
flung empire—people with spare land, a
fairly warm climate and a thirst for money
—to grow an easy and profitable and always-
needed crop. It was pointed out that there
is nothing against the crop save that the
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin” brand of literature and
Southern United States tradition has associ-
ated it with colored labor, and that in Egypt
and India it is necessarily grown by colored
labor, there being no other available. When
one comes to think of it, potatoes and sugar
and most other things suffer from the same
disability. The multitudinous and wide-
spread colored person has cultivated so many
things that if the white person abjured them
all as tainted he would be left with little to
eat or wear save whisky. Potheen or usque-
baugh is at least pure white. The invita-
tion to grow more cotton and make money
was responded to in almost all the available
places—even in densely-crowded and already
fairly well cultivated ones —save Australia.
Australia leads the world for loans, for use-
less public works and for the cultivation of an
unskilled population which, because it knows
no trade, is largely parasitic, and it is well
up in it's supply of trades-union secretaries
and mad, feverish theories about revolution.
But when it comes to taking up a new agri-
cultural idea China is almost a Melbourne Cup
winner by comparison. It almost shudders
at the mention of a new vegetable. It was
always willing -to grow wheat as the old,
orthodox, imported convicts had done, even
though this is a country with a ™ry low
wheat yield per acre, and was willing to
keep at it even when the local demand was
overtaken and it became a matter of depend-
ence on a very distant and generally low-
priced and wholly unenthusiastic foreign
market. But it refused the most heated
and tempting invitations to do something
new, and would neither grow cotton to sell
to Britain nor to make its own clothes
and supply its own factories. Yet Austra-
lia, in a recent year of moderately high
prices, spent fully £10,000,000, much of it
borrowed money, on imported cotton eoods.
At the same time it kept the largest, or almost
the largest cotton area in the Empire vacant
of that much-needed vegetable. Still, things
are improving—slowly. Some few ex-soldiers
have tried the cotton industry up north, and,
having plenty of good sites to choose from,
the reports are excellent. The returns have
been as high as £3O per acre, of which out-
of-pocket expenses were under £lO. These
settlers were new men, but, then, the work
is simple (the nigger was quite bright enough
for it) and not heavy (the nigger wasn’t too
slothful for it). As the cotton countrv has
a regular rainy season, which the wheat
country lacks, prospects should , continue
good. In fact, there is talk of so far over-
coming conservatism and inertia as to har-
vest 15,000 acres this season, and the spec-
tacle of Australia in its own cotton shirt >may
yet be witnessed. But there is a lot of
dead-weight to be shifted first; and Craw-
ford Vaugiian and H. C. Armstrong, who
have come back to Australia as representa-
tives of British people interested in the pro-
duction of the vegetable within the Empire,
are entitled to the help of patriots in shift-

Shirking Made Honorable.
The Defence Department’s scheme of card-
indexing the technical experts for the next
war is admirable as a' matter of principle.
The last war was becoming more and more
a chemical and engineering struggle to-
wards the finish ; and by that time, co far
as the A.I.F. was concerned, many promis-
ing chemists and engineers had been killed ;
others were serving as privates or gunners;,
others were still civilians. Under pure
voluntaryism, however, an effect of the pro-
posed change will be to give able-bodied
youngsters an excuse for dodging their duty.
A line can be got by a consideration of
what happened in the medical profession
after 1914. About half the total number
of doctors in Australia served. But of
these many were elderly men whose patriot-
ism and high-spirited unselfishness were in
advance of their physical powers, and many
more were inexperienced boys who had been
rushed through their University courses to
enable them to fill the gaps. One of the
greatest surgeons in Australia —in the world
—looking after measles cases at Lemnos
when lie would have been much better em-
ployed at home; a boy of 22 performing
major operations under shell-fire in France
when his proper place was either as a com-
batant or in a medical class-room learn-
ing his profession—these were some of
the tragedies of the unscientific and hap-
hazard system the Commonwealth took over
Irom Britain. Meanwhile, in Australia, one
class of gifted young medico was frankly
cutting into the practices of his rivals who
were serving, while another type—one who
was only a doctor to the extent that he had
qualified as such —was drawing a captain’s
pay for home-service work that any debili-
tated clerk could have done. Everyone who
went through the late calamity with his
eyes open came to realise very soon that
there is a large proportion of citizens —
often the loudest Imperialists in the piping
times of peace—who, when the guns begin
to shoot, think little of their country, but a
great deal of honor with immunity from
physical danger. These sorry warriors
crowded into base, troopship and head-
quarters jobs and held them in many cases
till the end, though they were young enough
to fight, and though older civilians would
have given as good service cv better in their
positions. If the sensible and equitable
thing were done automatically as soon as
war was declared, and the Government im-
mediately imposed conscription, the register-
ing for service of all the doctors, vets.,
engineers, lawyers, University professors,
dentists and so on in the country would have
obvious advantages. In the circumstances
the only remedy is to impose an age-limit
for all the technical corps based on a years-
instead of a youth-qualification. Except in
rare cases, where discretion might be left
the G.0.C., every Army lawyer, or
chemist, or architect, or sanitary expert
should be over, say, 40 years of age. Other-
wise, inevitably, a small army of heftv
young potential fighters will find sanctuary
where they are likely to do the State com-
paratively small service.

The Ban of Unholy Church.
The arrogant priesthood of the Labor Church
has put its ban, curse, interdict and greater
and lesser excommunication on Mount Mor-
gan, probably the largest single enter-
prise in Queensland harrinv the loan
railways, and though the railways are
in Queensland they are owned in
Europe. Morgan was a profitable enter-
prise until the slump in prices and the
strike, and it could be alive again and a
large employer of labor save for the dictum
of Unholy Church. The situation is sim-
plicity itself —also it is lunacy Itself. Cop-
per, which was £59 per ton before the war,
rose to about £l3O during that mel6e, and
wages rose with it. Copper is now selling
at not much over £65, but the union rulers,
whose orders the rank and file implicitly
obey, and whose salaries go on, strike or no
strike, have ordered that wages must stay
up. In other words, a miracle is to be
worked by the employers, to whom all the
miracle jobs are left, and they are to pay as
much out of the present price as they could
out of twice that amount. Any disclaimer
of the miracle-working power is treated with
ridicule, it being an axiom in some quarters
that the “capitalist” can produce millions
out of a hat, or bring down rain, or write a
new Shakspeabe, and oply his obstinacy
prevents him. It was thought that work
might have been resumed on the basis of a
20 per cent, wage reduction (not 50 per
cent, as in the United States and elsewhere),
seeing that that would assure the employees
the entire output, the free use of all plant
and machinery, a large Government subsidy
and some further subsidy from the company’s
reserves while they last. (The wage reduc-
tion was called 20 per cent., but certain jug-
gling with the subsidy made it 13 per cent,
only.) There was to be no increase of
hours. The terms really meant presenting
the mine, plus a subsidy, to the employees.
But the persons who issue directions to
Labor and order the universe to be brought
to them on a plate, demanded their miracle
or nothing. Further, as the Court had recom-
mended a reduction of wages, as the only
alternative to no wages at all and a life of
begging, borrowing or stealing, it was decided
that strong measures were called for to pre-
vent future offers of compromise. A resolu-
tion was therefore carried that the dav the
Court’s proposal was gazetted the Black Curse
should be put on Mount Morgan. The old
employees are not to work in it, and no new
employees are to be allowed to take the jobs
the old ones don’t want, and if the owners
could work their property themselves, which
of course they can’t, they would be prevented.
It is proposed that this shall last till the
practically impossible happens, and as all
copper-mines are in the same situation as re-
gards price, and some are in a worse situation
as regards costs, the Black Curse is really to
lie indefinitely on the whole of the one great
mineral industry Queensland possesses. If
the Conspiracy’ to Prevent Work Being
Done requires further support it is proposed
that Unholy Church shall lay its ban on the
people’s railways and wharves, and make
them put Mount Morgan in a state of isola-
tion, as used to be done with lepers and
heretics. The habit of putting places and
persons under an interdict is very ancient.
Now it is industries that are outlawed, and
so accustomed are people to seeing their laws
and courts overridden by the Labor priest-
hood, that its offhand disposal of other men’s
jobs, wages, properties and freedom of action,
without any regard to other men’s alleged
self-governing rights, has become a matter of‘
course. There is no hope for this country
until such things cease to be accepted as a
matter of course.

The Law’s Delays and a Cut Throat.
In the old hanging days Arthur Bryce
Peden, found guilty on a second trial at
Sydney of murdering his wife at Tumbalong

(N.5.W.)., would ere this have been well and
truly disposed of at the end of a rope. As
he is still alive and his attorney at liberty
to go round asking the Law what it can do
about a person condemned in such circum-
stances as Peden was, the wretched man has
at least the opportunity of being thankful that
Nosey Bob no longer practises his profes-
sion. Peden —whose case was outlined in
The Bulletin on September 8, after the
failure of his first appeal—endeavored last
week to induce the High Court to grapple
with the problem of whether the evidence
against him had justified conviction. Inci-
dentally, he submitted affidavits to show that
fresh 'evidence of an important character,
bearing upon thb alleged murder, could be pro-
duced. The usual legal rigmarole followed,
turning upon whether by effluxion of time
Peden had forfeited his right to a second
appeal, and whether, since no misdirection of
the jury or admission of wrongful evidence
was alleged, an appeal could stand. Everything
having been boiled down, the Court in despair
announced that in law the application for
permission to appeal would have to be thrown
out, but that their Honors were of opinion
that “Peden’s conviction might very
properly form the subject of inquiry by the
Executive.” This is practically what the
State Full Court has said, and the proba-
bility now is that the Executive will either
direct a judicial review of the case under
the Crimes Act, or itself settle the
matter in the light of plain common
sense and reports furnished by the Judges.
Peden is in the calamitous position of a
poor man condemned upon entirely insufficient
evidence—indeed, upon ho evidence at all—
yet convicted at a trial that was in law
flawless. As one of the curiosities of crim-
inal jurisprudence his case may have in-
tense interest for Wigs; but as Peden is
still under sentence of death, this aspect
can have no special attractions for him.
It would be something worse than cruelty
if the Executive allowed delay to take place
in freeing Justice from the shackles in which
it has been bound in dealing with this man.
At the trial there were two vital allega-
tions against the prisoner—one that it was
he who found the body, and that there was
blood on one of his hands when he gave
the alarm ; the other that the wounds which
caused the death of his wife (a woman
steeped in neurasthenia and, according to
her medical attendant, having strong suici-
dal impulses) were homicidal —certainly not
suicidal. Evidence is now available that it
was not Peden who found the body; and
other evidence given at the trial has grave
doubts thrown upon it. Also Herbert Mait-
land, Sydney’s eminent surgeon, having
lately been shown the pickled head presented
by the medical witnesses for the Crown, de-
clares that, in his judgment, the wounds are
just those which might be expected in a
case of suicide. The doubt about whether
Peden’s wife was slain by any other hand
than her own is now stronger than ever;
the evidence convicting Peden with the
crime, if there w-as one, is even more nebu-
lous than before. The Bulletin has
already said there was nothing in this evi-
dence to show that I'eden was the mur-
derer of his wife —that her death could be
accounted for upon at least two other hypo-
theses. It would almost seem now as if
the evidence available not only confirms
this, but strengthens the suspicion of every-
body directly concerned in the trials and
appeals that Peden may have been as inno-
cent as the Crown Prosecutor.
The Mildura Carrot.
The easiest line in the reforming business is
to identify the rich “tyrant,” and get very
wild indeed, and demand that his property
shall be taken from him and given to the
poor. This mostly applies to land settle-
ment, and is much easier than building and
running a new factory. A recent address at
LithgQw was a case in point (Sydney Tele-
graph report) —•
Dr. Hayden, Bishop of Wileannia [which means
Broken Hill], said he had recently discussed with
Mr. Dooley the great Land Bill the Labor party had
in hand. He hoped Mr. Loughlin would be equal
to the task before him of doing something to settle
the great Western Lands question. As far back as
1901 or 1902 the infamous Western Lands Bill was
passed, whereby over 80,000,000 acres were locked up
for the benefit of .syndicates which were given leases
that would hot expire until 1944 or 1945. Was that
state of things beneficial to a great country? If
they travelled from Balranald to Wentworth they
would see some of the finest country in Australia and
no one living on it. If they went over the border
to Mildura, the great irrigation country, they would
find that Victoria had solved the problem of closer
settlement.
No doubt “some of the finest country in
Australia” does lie between Balranald and
Wentworth. In the bright lexicon of the
booster and the boomer it lies everywhere.
But these places are a long way from Syd-
ney of Melbourne, and they are a deuce of
a way from the London wheat market, and
if good land lies about Balranald small set-
tlers of sense incline to let it lie till there
is a market for produce a great deal closer.
That 45,000 acres have been set aside for an
irrigation settlement at Mildura, and that
about 15,000 acres are under close cultiva-
tion after 34 patient years, are no reasons
why N. S. Wales should throw its tenants
with curses off 50,000,000 dry acres, and then
fail to replace them. Already the Ma State
has one Mildura of its own in the iviurrum-
bidgee area; and it will be quite time enough
to talk of other N. S. Wales Milduras when
the tremendously costly works which have
been carried out at Burrinjuck are serving as
many settlers as they can serve. Nothing
could be worse for either the country or the
settlers themselves than a multiplicity of set-
tlements each overloaded with capital. Still,
one can’t reasonably expect that any such
consideration will prevent the city politician
talking wildly about “opening up’’ the remote
dry lands and throwing off the blood-sucking
syndicates which allegedly monopolise them.
The city politician is not really concerned
about the remote dry lands, and', indeed, he
mostly knows nothing at all about them ; but
such talk diverts attention from his neglect
of problems nearer home. Like Hosea Big-
low’s pious editor, he does “believe in Free-
dom’s cause as fur away as Paris is.” As
long as he shrieks about his tremendous en-
thusiasm in the great task of opening up the
lands at the back of Bourke, he can continue
to do nothing in the direction of opening up
the lands at the back of the outports. But
it is rather sad to see men who are not pro-
SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY.
“We knock off note, mate — we’ve done our 44 backets.”
“Wonder what’ll happen later on. We could hardly keep the water down when we
were doing 48 buckets.”
“Dunno; but it’s all right while it lasts.”

Notre Dame and Willie Watt.
In the Middle Ages the building of a cathe-
dral was the work of many generations;
but the original architect and the first work-
ers could die with the confidence that the
job they began would be finished in the
same spirit. There was no accident about
it. Notre Dame, Rheims, Chartre's and the
other great cathedrals did not just grow,
like mushrooms and politicians; they were
conscious, works of art, designed as delib-
erately as a statue by Michael Angelo.
The cathedral in all its glory would be seen
by the mind’s eye 50 or ‘IOO years be-
fore the last stone was carved into a cheerful
little devil. But this happened in the Age
of Faith, when people ; really believed in
something; and it is certain that no horrid
fears-haunted the pioneer workers that when
they passed away their great dream would
be spoilt by profiteering contractors or slov-
enly, incompetent craftsmen. In the Dark
Ages, before we became enlightened, people
believed in work and took pride in it, other-
wise we wouldn’t have the cathedrals. But
we have changed all that. People no longer
pretend to take any joy in labor, which is
regarded as a dreary business, even a posi-
tive curse. They do not work for the benefit
of humanity or the glory of God ; they only
do it because, like the apologetic comedian,
they need the money. Labor means only so
many disagreeable hours and so much cash.
Few take any pride in their craftsmanship
for its own sake; their interests lie right
away from their work, in skittles, or poli-
tics, or pony-racing, or picture-shows. There
is no unity of aim, as in the Dark Ages,
when the people built cathedrals, but only
a conflict of interests. On the one hand
we have the contractor to whom a job is
a speculation, and who frets and fumes and
worries till he finds how he comes out of it.
He wants it over quick. On the other hand
we have the workers, who don’t care whether
they are building a cathedral or a hen-house,
and whose chief concern is to make the job
last as long as possible, or longer. There is
no pleasure to anybody in it. The workers
don’t break _ into song because they are
happy at their job ; mostly they despise song
and go in for one-eyed economics instead.
What’s the_ good of art and beauty, for
everything is done by Economic Determi-
nism, and there is no God, and Marx is liis
prophet! If we go on like this we will never
do anything except justify Willie Watt’s
famous dictum that a man can’t be trusted
to work unless the boss keeps an eye on
him. That philosophical principle was un-
known to the carvers of Notre Dame, who
were so ignorant that they actually put in
a lot of wonderful work in all kinds of odd
corners where nobody could have been look-
ing. Probably they knew no better. They
may even have found joy and satisfaction
in their wrong-doing. Rodin once remarked
that the chief lesson the artist had to teach
the modern world was that a man might
love his work. We shall have to get back
nearer to Rodin before we set our world on
its feet again. We shall have to rehabili-
tate the arts and the crafts. We shall have
to devote more attention to the apprentices.
We shall have to enormously increase their
number. and correspondingly decrease the
number of the odd-jobbers and the white
coolies. Labor in its. sordid materialism is
doing the born-poor of the world no greater
disservice at the moment than in its atti-
tude of hostility to apprenticeship, and in
pursuing those policies which make abun-
dance of purely temporary work available
at high wages to the unskilled young, at no
matter what cost to posterity.
Australian pacifists and internationalists
and anti-nationalists and anti-“conseription-
ists'? and universal brotherhooders may pro-
test as they please against compulsory ser-
vice, but it goes on. Thus the Irish Sinn
hem Government, with a view to the pro-
bable failure of negotiations, called up the
new season’s crop of conscripts just as any
old French or German or Austrian or Italian
Government might do, and set them drilling.
There is nothing international or universal-
brotherly or Karl Marxy about Sinn Fein
It is as frankly national as the most robust
White Australian could wish, and it is for
straight-out conscription as a natural con-
sequence. As a matter of fact, there never
has been a voluntary army anywhere,
though there has often been" a voluntary
mob. Britain toyed with the optional-ser-
vice idea at times—that is to say, it tried
to fight Washington by hiring compulsory
Germans, and had Nelson’s compulsory navy
to back up Welling to n”s semi-compulsory
army. But even in the most peaceful days
of the army the scheme was all a fraud.
Going in was more or less voluntary, though
the recruit was often too drunk to know
that he was doing it. But staying in
for the full term, which was the thing the
soldier became really worried about, was as
peremptory in the British as in any other
force, and voluntary departure led to a vast
amount of imprisonment and flogging.
Neither an army, nor a trades union wili
represent voluntary service until not only
entrance but resignation (i.e., desertion) is
as free as air.
$
Bishop Hayden, of Broken Ilill, hopes that
the infamous Western (N.S.W.) Lands Bill
passed 18 or 20 years ago will be “dealt
with” by Dooley and Lougiilin, since it
has locked up wonderful areas in the hands
of syndicates till 1943. Was there ever a
20-year-old Land Law that wasn’t “infa-
mous”? The simple facts about this one are
that, prior to its passing, Western lands still
in the squatters’ hands were divided into
leasehold and resumed areas —half and half
—and for the resumed areas they had only
a weekly tenancy. The result was that tens
of millions of acres of land were left prac-
tically unimproved, to the general disad-
vantage of the country and the particular
disadvantage of Labor. It was, therefore,
with the cordial co-operation of that part of
Labor which knew the conditions of the
Far West that the Western Lands Act was
passed ; and Hugh Langwell, one of the
earliest of Labor members, was appointed
a Commissioner to administer it. The whole
purpose was to give the holders a tenure
which would encourage them to make the
improvements without which the vast bulk
of this Western land is quite unprofitable;
and it has served that purpose. Inciden-
tally, the entire area was not “locked up,”
provision being made for the withdrawal
of a portion of every holding for selection;
and nothing like the full area available for
withdrawal has yet been applied for. The
real problem so far as the bulk of the dry
inlands of Australia is concerned is how to
get them improved 'so that the holders can
stand up against the drought and other
curses which afflict them ; and the first essen-
tial is a reasonable security of tenure over
a fairly long period. Those who want these
territories developed cannot do them a worse
service than bv destroying the confidence of
the holders that the rights they have will
be respected.
“ J.P.” on a matter of history:—
Sydney Sun printed an attack on Charles
Bean's “Story of Anzac” for suggesting that Labor
was largely responsible for the Defence policy
which did so much to save Australia in the Great
War. The truth about the matter is interesting if
only as showing how far Labor has swung away
from the policies on which it reached power. Among
the sections that were most noisy against Australian
defence in those days were the members of the
“Dreadnought League”—the gentlemen who put up
£lO,OOO apiece to dish what was known in Club
circles as “the tinpot Labor party fleet.” There
were also the people whom Lord Dudley had to
rebuke for accusing his Ministers, in his presence,
or “disloyalty” because they had declared for an
Australian navy. There was Joseph Cook, who
said at Parramatta that the object the Laborites
had in creating this fleet was that it should ulti-
mately turn its guns on the Royal Navy. There
were the Argus, the S. M. Herald and the
Telegraph —all openly opposed to the R.A.N. from
the moment it was first mooted. The same sections
fought what they called “the un-English policy of
conscription” to the last ditch —that, of course,
was when universal training w-as being estab-
lished long before the war. The National Ser-
vice League which was formed in Sydney to push
on the policy that Labor approved and Liberalism
(as anti-Labor called itself at the time) detested
contained a few well-known names of Conserva-
tives who w 7 ere out of politics, like Barton, or
who, like G. R. Campbell, had never been in
politics. But the leaders of the movement were J.
C. Watson, Andrew Fisher and W. M. Hughes—
particularly Hughes. The bulk of the weight behind
Fisher when he swept the country on local defence
was no doubt Nationalist rather than proletarian,
but it had to vote Labor to express itself.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Woodrow Wilson, the academical scholar
and university professor, being no longer
President of the United States, instead of
offering the Disarmament Conference in
Washington some beautiful abstractions the
Government there put before the body at its
very first meeting concrete proposals for
doing the thing. The world has so much
wastage to make good, and the cost of main-
taining a state of preparedness for modern
war is so appalling, that any proposal is
better than none. A movement of some sort
in that direction, sooner or later, is inevit-
able; and the sooner it comes the better for
nations that already stagger under their
loads. The most outstanding feature of the
American scheme is that it refers only to
naval armament. Broadly, it is proposed
that Britain shall be allowed to have 22
capital ships, the U.S. 18 and Japan 10.
This would mean that Britain would scrap
30 capital ships, America 19 and Japan 17.
Apart from the doubt whether Britain,
having done nothing of late in the way of
big ship-building, would not be prejudiced by
this formula, the question arises whether the
limitation proposed meets the case of an
Empire so world-wide that the five seas are
its natural highway. Neither the U.S.A.
nor Japan has any overseas dominions worth
speaking about. The U.S.A., at any rate,
is almost wholly self-contained; and even
to Japan the maintenance of the sea-routes
is not so vitally necessary as it is to Britain.
And not only have those sea-routes to be kept
open to preserve the very life of Britain, but
far-separated overseas portions of the Brit-
ish Commonwealth —Australia, Maoriland,
Canada, S. Africa, India, the Straits Settle-
ments and the Pacific Islands—call for naval
defence. For we have to consider the possi-
bilities of an offensive alliance,. one section
of which may threaten the British Islands
while another section may threaten, say,
Australia.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Following on Joe Cook's appointment ais High Com-
missioner a little earlier than was expected, there. is
a revival of rumors about a projected entente with
the Corner party; and it was mentioned in the lobbies
on Friday that two portfolios would be available to
the Cockies if they wanted them. But acceptance
would involve a promise of unanimous loyalty and
obedience to Hughes —a condition that the Gumleaves
probably wouldn’t agree to without consulting their
organisations. Meantime, all eyes are turned on
Parramatta, where Pratten will have the Nationalist
nomination. But he won’t have a walkover. A. B.
Piddington, formerly of the Inter-State Commission,
will stand as an Independent, pushing his ideas about
childhood endowment; and there will be a vigorous
Labor candidate. Willie Kelly finally decided
not to run as a Farmers’ representative. The
beautifully-dressed creature’s appearance as a Cocky
might be a bit of a joke, but he would be welcome
back to Parliament in any guise. The House i=
simply hungry for a person of his sprightly imper-
tinence.
The N.S.W. Board of Trade, created for
the purpose ( among other things) of fixing
a basic wage from' time to time, lately de-
cided on the figures that the time had come
for a reduction; whereupon the Gabor
Caucus instructed tlie Government to rush
through a bill nailing down the old basic
wage for 12 months. The Caucus is quite
wrong when it asserts that the time hasn t
come to reduce wages; but it is quite right
when it inferentially asserts that the fixing
of a so-called basic wage is a legislative
and not a judicial job. Nothing would be
easier than to find a dozen Judges who,
working independently, would fix a basic
wage at a dozen different figures. _ What a
Judge might do, on scientific evidence, is
to declare the minimum amount on which
a man can be fed so as to maintain him in
working condition; but when it comes to
saying what he should have in order to
maintain him and his wife and a certain
number of children (which he mostly hasn t
got) in “reasonable comfort,” then opinion
comes in, and a Judge isn’t more qualified
to form an opinion on the subject of what
is “reasonable comfort” than a doctor or a
navvy. Parliament is supposed to be chosen
because of its opinions; and it is the only
body competent to deal with such issues.
But that isn’t saying that the principle of
the basic wage is sound; as a matter of fact,
it is thoroughly rotten. Nor is it to say
that a Party Parliament would do the fax-
ing honestly* It is much more likely to do
it quite dishonestly.
The useful Judge Ewing, of Tasmania,
who conducted the I.W.W. inquiry in Syd-
ney, should be getting his bag packed.
While allusions to Labor rule at Sydney
Town Hall were confined to remarks about
the strange craving to pay £75,000 of the
ratepayers’ money for property valued at
£5OOO, or to give £40,000 of the ratepayers
money to a professional firm for doing the
Council officers’ own work, the Labor press
treated all suspicions with lordly disdain.
But now that a definite charge of bribery
has been made, there is an impassioned de-
mand that “th§ sneers and filthy insinua-
A VERY REASONABLE REQUEST.
“What I am now forwarding is an official minute prepared by myself to Judge Beeby and I hope
for his official [re the NSW Board of Trade’s reduction of the basic wage], whatever it may
at a very early date. There nothing of an ‘influencing’ nature in the minute."-Labor Minuter

All I want you to do is to see that the pendulum swings only one way.
tions of the other side” should be looked
into which “the other side” has wanted for
a long time, and that “the Government
should step in and order an exhaustive in-
vestigation of the Council’s business. 4'? c *
who could be more exhaustive than Mr.
Ewing?
From the N.S.W. Gallery:—
Last week N.S.W. Government bullocked two mea-
sures through the Assembly—one to compulsorily
pool the wheat crop, the other to restrict the muni-
cipal franchise in Sydney to people who sleep within
the boundaries of the city. The Leg. Council threw
the Wheat Bill out on sight. The other bill was
sent up to the ancients with certainty of execution.
Both had been debated with intense bitterness. The
Ministry insisted that it regarded them as policy
measures of the first importance. Never was suen
humbug imposed upon the public. From first to
last the whole business connected with the two
wretched bills —the snuffling of Ministers about then
platform and all the rest of it—was just plain fraud.
No large number of Dooleyites wanted to get involved
in a compulsory wheat pool. Still fewer were
enthusiastic about the project to make a big,
wealthy firm a present of the juicy monopoly of
arranging all the shipping charters and selling the
harvest in London. Yet they all voted that way.
Queeily enough some of the Opposition who roared
insults at Dooley for bringing the bill along were
privately friendly to it. Thus there was staged
the paradox of a Ministry and its followers toiling
like beavers to get a bill which many of them dis-
liked to the second Chamber for assassination,, and
an Opposition struggling to strangle something
which many of them secretly yearned to see live. In
the case of the Sydney Municipal Bill, it is doubtful
whether a single member of the Assembly expected
it would reach the statute-book, and it is equally
doubtful whether a single member of the Ministry
hoped it would. The explanation of it all is that
the Ministry, which takes its policy from the A.L.I .
Executive, was given specific instructions to com-
mandeer the wheat crop and deprive tenants and
property-owners of a municipal vote. The Govern-
ment did what it was bidden to do, and now the
A.L.P. Executive is sitting down with the wreckage,
cogitating on the next step. This is what Represen-
tative Government has come to.
Vic. Liberals have dug themselves in more
securely by passing the \\ heat Corporation
Bill, which provides for a voluntary pool
with a State guarantee of 4s. a bushel. A
clause put in by the Uppah Chambah, at
the instance of Ministers—it empowers the
Government to compel the corporation to
sell at a reasonable price for local consump-
tion —is one which the Cocky party will be
none too eager to permit a Labor Govern-
ment to administer. So Lawson is appa-
rently safe for a year at least.
Respecting a feeble finisher: —
In the last phase of the fiscal controversy In the
House of Reps. Massy Greene failed to measure up
to the Kingston standard. His affability got the
better of him, and the result was a series of weak
concessions to the foreign traders in the Senate.
Particularly inglorious was the halving of the duty
of 3d. per foot on foreign cinematographic films,
meaning principally the slushy productions of the
Y'ank. Five per cent, was also knocked off the
duties on agricultural implements, and when the
same thing was done in the case of boots and
shoes even Watt looked as if he repented of the
enthusiastic things he had said about the too-
obliging Minister when the tariff was first intro-
duced. But the fencing-wire industry, in which
£500,000 has been invested by Rylands Brothers
at Newcastle (N.S.W.), and in which 750 men are
normally engaged, got the worst jolt. Evidence was
produced that Rylands are unable to compete with
the cheap Belgian and British wire with which the
market has been flooded, and that, instead of putting
on 700 more hands as they hoped to do, they have
had to close down two-thirds of their plant. It
was also shown that their profits for the past year
were about H per cent, less than their capital
would have yielded if the}' had put it into wai
stock. In face of these facts the foreign-trade Sena-
tors peremptorily demanded that the impost on
fine-gauge British wire should be lowered from a
modest 25 per cent, to a lion-protective 20 p.c.,
and the Polite Minister yielded without a struggle.
Kingston would have seen them desiccated fust.
The Treasurer of the Vic. Government,
which declines to legalise the tote lest it
be accused of offering sanction to gambling,
informed his brethren in Parliament that
many millions of betting tickets have been
issued from the Government Printing Grace
this year, and -a further three millions would
be required to .supply bookmakers demands
to the end of it. The idea of bookmakers
buying their betting tickets from a Govern-
ment which dares not “legalise’ gambling is
truly Gilbertian —a sort of Board of Health
selling bubonic plague germs to rat-
breeders.
Having been primed with facts about the
1917 referendum, in which nearly six-
sevenths of the electorates 01 out of
voted for the retention of the Leg. Council,
Governor Nathan, of Queensland, has with-
held his imprimatur from the bill abolishing
that Chamber. He has thrown the responsi-
bility on Downing-street by reserving it for
the King’s assent. Meanwhile Bill Lennon
continues to draw £B5 a month as President,
and Nevitt £5B 6s. Bd. as Chairman of Com-
mittees. And the railway passes go on tor
life, or until a Nationalist-Cocky Govern-
ment calls them in.
A sinister plot to compel Government
clerks to watch the clock until 5 p.m., and
be nigger-driven for 39] hours per week
instead of 36i, is encircling the Common-
wealth. Theodore, of Queensland, started
the nefarious business, and the Victorian
Government has followed suit. There was
a gathering of the toil-worn and oppressed
in Melbourne the other day to denounce
their tyrants. But when the Demoulins of
the Tape and Sealing-wax Department
called upon them to rise as one man and
flapper against the diabolical ukase, on the
ground that the 5 o’clock trams and trains
would be thereby “congested,” the meeting
dissolved in laughter. That impassioned
anti-climax ruined a promising agitation.
By 13 votes to eight the Vic. Uppah Cham-
bali threw out Labor-member Kiernan ,s
little bill for the abolition of Melbourne and
Geelong aldermen. Cohen, K.C., and Ang-
liss fired the heaviest shots at the bantling.
The municipal government of Sydney, Ang-
liss argued, furnished the strongest possible
reason why the existing Melbourne .system
should be continued. So the sins of Labor
in Sydney help to preserve the anachronism
under which members of the Melbourne
Municipal Council continue as representa-
tives term after term without facing the
electors and getting re-commissioned. There
might be some justification for a system
which sent to the Chamber for a term a cer-
tain number of men chosen by the council-
lors for their eminence in finance or some
branch of science or art; but it can’t be
pretended that the present system amounts
to anything like that.
The Federal Country party is far too
unanimous in its hostility to the Australian
manufacturer. W. C. Hill, the member for
Echuca, is under the delusion that most ot
our “secondary producers” are robbers who
are not fit to associate with the importer.
Wherefore it was characteristic of him to
wail the other night about being deceived
into buying “Australian rubbish at imported
prices,” and the insult went into Hansard
without a word of reproof. Hill and his
mournful friend Prowse, who merely serves
to emphasise the bigness of his predecessor,
John Forrest, slander the products of Aus-
tralian factories by prejudiced comparisons
with the foreign article at every opportunity.
Gregory and the hardened pi os.
of the squad, are more diplomatic, though
they probably mention Cobden in their
prayers every night. Most of the others
are' similarly' afflicted, and lacking dialecti-
cal adroitness are often left without a shred
of argument to support their unpatriotic
faith. , „ _ . ,
Biting the hand that voted for him has
become a habit with Danny Levy, the N. S.
Wales Speaker. With Daniel’s help the
Dooley Government made brisk progress last
week with the bill which, by disfranchising
90 per cent, of those who get their living
in the city, but sleep beyond the municipal
boundaries, provides for the permanent Tam-
manyisation of Sydney. Most of the clauses
were bludgeoned through without debate, but
the just word was got in by Tom ’Enley:
Under the Government measure the property-
owners of the city are disqualified from becoming
aldermen or Lord Mayor. But if a circus stays a
month in Sydney the clown will be eligible for both
offices provided he sleeps in a tent.
It recalls John Bright’s gibe that the Tory
scheme of fancy franchises denied the vote
to an intelligent artisan, but gave it to a
ratcatcher with four dogs. Under the Syd-
ney Corporation Amendment Bill, a city rat-
catcher will be enfranchised, even if he
hasn’t got a dog. But the Governor of the
Commonwealth Bank won’t be.
AFTER THE THUNDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The thunderstorm had boomed and burst,
The air was wet with fallen rain;
The trees, this morning mad with thirst,
Had drunk and bathed and laughed again ;
And then the sudden weeds arose
And danced on moist and eager toes.
The doubtful gardener mildly swore,
And stood his hoe against a tree ;
The yellow seasons spread before,
Behind were months of misery ;
And so it seemed to suit him best
To leave the weeds and take a rest.
This simple parable remains
Writ large in every morning paper:
The blood of the late thunder-rains
Has caused the weeds to rise and caper;
And those that do the strangest tricks
Are tall and green in politics.
N.B.W.

Exclusive of Replacement and Depreciation l'und.
It is customary, and in some States obliga-
tory, for public cos. to attach to their pub-
lislied accounts auditors’ reports certifying
that those sheets are properly drawn up so
as to exhibit a true and correct view of their
affairs. The C.S.R. does not bother to ap-
pend an auditor’s certificate. So far as
the accounts for March and September terms
of this year are concerned, the “Wild Cat”
knows of no auditor who, with a clear con-
science, could certify that they do give a
true and correct statement of the result of
operations. In the accounts and accompany-
ing reports the management has understated
profits. According to the P. and L. accounts
presented for the two terms, net earnings,
after making unspecified provisions for re-
placements and depreciation, were £155,297
and £206,201 respectively. ■ But neither
P and L. account included a trifle of £40,625
m a caine in du’s. from the Fiji and Maori-
land subsuhaiy co. Bix months ago the
directors of the parent co. distributed direct
to its shareholders an extra di_v. ot os.,

I ut another way, the parent co. shows

names m other cos., which, though admit-
tedly producing very handsome dividends,
are according to the published accounts,
earning nothing whatever. Why tie C-’ • a.
management has adopted this policy is not
tbmaHo ' 9 mnrnßt y UnqUeS "
tionable. The morality of it isn t. _
The profits in the introductory table are
those shown by the management plus the
divs. from the subsidiary delivered direct
to the parent’s shareholders. The parent
co.’s div. off its own bat was 15s. per . share,
the subsidiary provided ss.—together 124
p.c. on paid capital. But half as much as
was distributed also passed into visible re-
serves. Even then the “Wild Cat” cannot
guarantee that £246,826 was the full mea-
sure of the half’s profits; the. C.S.R. has
always been noted for the magnitude of its
internal reserves—only six years ago 3*
millions were suddenly brought to light—
and it would be surprising if in the past
very gorgeous year the management did not
continue to practise its old art and sock
away large profits. The disclosed earnings
are the more stunning, though, because
about 12 months ago £650,000 of capital
was returned to shareholders. The past
year’s disclosed profits were 17 p.c. on capi-
tal; the previous best was slightly more than
10 p.c. The subsidiary—3| millions of its
34 millions of capital are the bonus shares
issued in 1915—has apparently also been
doing magnificently: that is evidenced by
the divs. at the rate of 324 P-c. which it
is paying ordinaries (which, of course, are
the parent co.). The Fiji and Mam-iland
concern issues accounts only once each year,
and the next lot will not be available until
towards the middle of next year.

The public’s interests are practically con-
fined to £150,000 of 6 p.c. debentures,
£200,060 of 7 p.c. Ist prefs., and a quarter-
million of 8 p.c. 2nd prefs. The former
two displaced 4f p.c. debentures and 5*
p.c. prefs. held in England when the old co.
decided to avoid double taxation and other
troubles by shifting camp to Melbourne.
The £250,000 of 2nd prefs. were offered in
February last to ease the strain put on
the co. by high-priced and abnormally large
stocks, and to finance increased business.
The issue was eagerly snapped up. Ordi-
nary capital is £609,035; but the scrip is
close-held by the old proprietors, and the
market is not much interested in it. Reid’s
latest balance-sheet is one of the first out
from the big softgoods warehouses to show
how they have suffered as a result of
all-round collapse of prices. The accounts
cover operations for the 12 months to July
19, and the earlier portion of that period
brought no reverses; but in the closing-
months of the financial year prices were
skittled in an endeavor to shake free of
costly stocks and retain old connections.
So, despite the earlier handsome earnings,
the year’s net profit was only £85,799, com-
pared with £309,562 for 1920, when a
quarter-million less capital was in the busi-
ness. But that tells only part of the
story of what happened as the result of the
butchering of prices. The management
states its policy in this way:—
Your directors feel that they must place the posi-
tion before those for whom they cater in such a way
as to inspire confidence and freedom in buying at
the market price of to-day. We may stress the
point that the only two items which are unpur-
chasable and invaluable are your staff and your
clientele or connection. Both of these, especially the
latter, are the result of 40 years’ growth, and it is
absolutely necessary that the efficiency and status
of both these sections should be maintained.
So it came to this: instead of holding off
in the hope of securing better prices, stocks
have been, or will be, sacrificed so that
clients may be kept under wing and not in-
duced to cross the road to an opposition
house. To assure that, £300,000 of reserves
were extracted in July to provide for price-
carving. The result, say the directors, has
been a “most beneficial effect on trading. . . .
the position to-day is highly satisfactory,
and proves that the co. is as popular as
ever, if not more so, and that the right steps
have been taken to ensure stability and con-
tinuity.”
The full extent of the damage sustained
will not be visible until next year’s accounts
are available, but the setting aside of
£300,000 for stock losses nearly four months
after the financial year closed hints that
little of those reserves can be expected to
appear in the next balance-sheet unless the
unexpected happens. There have probably
also been losses which do not meet the eye:
the directors admit that a “very large amount
has been written off during the depressing
period” ; but visible reserves were not called
on in that process—instead, £72,709 of re-
serves, apparently hidden away in the fat
years, have been brought to light. It would
have been surprising if, in . the days of con-
tinually rising markets and easy trading, old,
conservatively-managed houses like Robert
Reid’s did not cast a suspicious eye on the
inflated values and abnormal conditions and
ear-mark some of their luscious earnings for
use at the breaking of the boom.
Notwithstanding its troubles this co. offers
undoubted security for its debenture- and
pref.-holders, At July 19 outside debts
totalled £1,164,131. Stocks (less the re-
serve) stood in the books at the huge total
of £1.363.160. Book debts were £560.435,
£70,902 of investments and cash were held,
and properties and equipment ( less deprecia-
tion reserves) had a book value of £235,896.
The surplus of more or less liquid assets over
and above liabilities was £830,000-odd. The
debenture and preference share interests to-
gether total only £600,000. The stocks, as
protected, would have to lose 23 p.c. of their
value before liquid assets alone would not
provide a cover of 20s. in the £ for the bank,
depositors and other creditors, and the de-
benture- and pref.-holders. In addition to
which is the £235,896 of property, etc.,
mortgaged to the extent of about £86,000.

Since 1918 United shareholders have had
£135,000 of bonus scrip thrown to them;
meantime 10 p.c. divs. have been paid regu-
larly on old and bonus capital. But the co.
has had such a remarkably good run that
reserves are now £40,000-odd more than they
were three years ago. The latest surplus
was so large that besides the 10 p.c. div. it
provided one new bonus share for every
five previously held, and then left for
reserves 34 p.c. on capital. Paid capital is
now £300,000; reserves total £358,122, in-
clusive of funds protecting unexpired risks
and of a reserve of £28,248 covering depre-
ciation of securities, the latter being re-
garded as a genuine reserve because only
msaster will demand the unloading of gilt-
edged securities oerore they are redeemed at
their full face value. The latest is the
United’s 59th annual report, but it has been
only within recent years that its pockets
have bulged : average annual profits for the
past two years have exceeded the paid capi-
tal of only eight years ago. The explanation
lies in this record of underwriting opera-
tions :

Those figures show an amazing growth of
business since pre-war days. Of course,
the United is not singular in that respect. Its
premium income has just about kept pace
with the general increase in business, if the
aggregate figures for N. 8. Wales are a
reliable guide. The larger income is mostly
the result of war influences, though work-
men’s compensation has also helped. Had
losses and expenses continued at the pre-
war average,, the insurance cos. would auto-
matically have harvested larger profits
because of the increased turnover. The
United’s loss rate, however, has. slackened to
such an extent that, despite heavier exes.,
its underwriting profit last year was 18.2 p.c.
of net premium income compared with 11.2
p.c. for 1914. That improvement alone gave
£19,900 more profit on last year’s operations
than would have been the case if outgoings
had been maintained on the pre-war scale.
Meantime, also, larger funds have been earn-
ing higher interest; income from investments
was £11,780 for 1914 and £32,330 last year.
Though the United’s net premium income
was a few thousands less last year than in
the year before, there was no decline in poli-
cies : gross premiums advanced from £538,709
to £595,095, but the management, influenced
no doubt by the less favorable conditions
ruling, laid-off £310,682 compared with
£251,516 in 1920. The great flood of high-
priced imports offset any tendency of pre-
mium income to sag because of the general
decline of values. It is unlikely, though,
that the recent volume of insurances will be
maintained. On the other hand, the rnr>:'d
expansion of the Commonwealth’s manufac-
turing industries has been providing new
sources of business, and there are many
lines of insurables whose value will not
decline to any extent while high wages rule.
The very handsome profits of recent vears
have helped to maintain the United’s posi-
tion in the front-rank of the Commonwealth’s
home-grown insurance offices. After pay-
ment of the latest divs. there were funds
totalling £658,000, equal to 231 p.c. of the past
year’s net premium income. That is unusual
strength : funds equal to 150 p.c. of premiums
are generally considered reasonable _ protec-
tion for policy-holders. The United’s funds
could meet claims 6f times greater than last
year’s losses. And should the worst happen,
there is £300,000 of capital callable. - The
co.’s assets are an excellent lot: of the. total
of £746,481, £532,001 is in public securities,
cash, deposits, etc., £49,368 is out on mort-
gage, £60,831 of debentures other than Gov-
ernment paper are held, and the balance of
£104.281 is the book value of freehold
premises.

Every few years Joe Gardiner’s co. has
called in an outside expert to examine
stocks: in that way the public was assured
that the value placed upon them by the man-
agement was all it should Lave been. Such an
examination was made by veteran manufac-
turer A. Louden when the staff had made
up the stock-sheets as at July 31, 1919. Mr.
Louden then reported':
I certify with every confidence that the asset-
value placed on the stocks as contained in the co.’s
stocks-sheets is most conservative, and a value en-
hancing daily under the existing conditions of in-
creasing prices of leathers. I wish to add the stock
generally is keenly bought, clean and systematically
well kept.
This hinted that, while the directors were
showing a profit insufficient by £515 to pay
a 10 p.c. div. on capital which had shortly
before been increased from £(‘>0,000 to
£BO,OOO almost wholly by reserve transfers,
they were adopting a safety-first policy of
regarding with suspicion the inflated values
of leather goods. The market continued to
rise, so the retail prices which were easily
got in 1920 showed a handsome margin of
profit on the book value of the stocks held
when the term opened and also on the year’s
expensive purchases. Owing to the opera-
tions of ’Murkan and other speculators in
the market, leather prices soared to unpre-
cedented heights, so instead of the £98,090
of stocks held by this co. at the 1919 bal-
ance, at July 31, 1920, there was £121,914
on hand—and that appraisement may also
have been “conservative” in the light of
values then existing. Everything went well
until April last, when the inevitable crash
in prices of raw materials arrived. As
cheaper manufactures got on the market
Gardiner’s and other retailers had to cut
prices, and trading losses resulted. All of
the £20,871 loss shown in the table, how-
ever, was not incurred in selling. When a
tally of stocks was made at the end of July,
the management discovered that what had
been paid for them, and the values which
had previously been given some of them,
were approximately £15,000 greater than the
cost of their replacement. So the directors
decided to regard the £15,000 as having
been lost, and in that way put stocks on a
basis which should assure the co. being on
a sound footing for future trading. The
alternative would have been to continue to
sell at a loss on old book values, and go to
the bad in the trading accounts until
cheaply-bought stocks again gave profit-
earning opportunities. The directors adopted
the only sound method of meeting the situa-
tion. They are now in the position of being
able to report that, having made provision
“which they feel is adequate,” “the pros-
pects judged by the increased sales appear
promising, and if this continues a profit on
the current year’s trading can be antici-
pated.”
Just prior to the collapse an interim div.
(5 p.c.) was paid, so altogether the accounts
show the co. to have gone £24,371 to the
bad during the year. All reserves have been
swallowed, and the current accounts opened
with a debit at P. and L. of £8417. Goodwill
still stands in the balance-sheet at £6777, so
£15,194 of the capital of £BO,OOO is not
backed by tangible assets. How very dif-
ferent would have been the position if, dur-
ing the abnormal war period, nearly £20,000
of reserves had not been converted into
scrip! Until its recent bitter experience
Joe Gardiner’s had been a very successful
concern; and over 10 vears divs. have aggre-
gated more than 120 p.c. on the total cash
put in. The co. has a wider connection in
Sydney than the use of its registered title
as a trading signboard would suggest. “Joe
Gardiner” may be a captivating trade-name
in the democratic Haymarket; but on “The
Block” and elsewhere the co. puts out a
more tony sign. The co.’s position is not
so comfortable as in former years, when
very little freehold property was held. There
are now freehold premises with a book value
of £21,245, £12,708 of which has been
financed by mortgage. All other debts totted
up £34.497 at July 31; on the other side
were £83.417 of more or less liquid assets.
Leasehold premises £2189 and fittings, plant,
etc., £6194 completed the list of tangibles.
If all the book values were right, the co.
showed net tangible assets of 16s. 2d. per
£1 share.

The timber trade has also had its troubles.
American sticks, at prices lower than had
ruled previously, poured in early in the year,
and as A. and E. Ellis were already fullv
stocked for current trading wfitli stuff bought
at higher rates, there was a compulsory sag
in the price-lists. Resides, the general de-

tion of wasting assets, £5065 was all the
profit which could be unearthed as a result
of the year’s operations. That was only
5 p.c. on paid capital, and as the directors
decided to pay 7-J p.c. reserves have been
tapped for £2500. Meantime there have
been no changes of any consequence in the
balance-sheet figures:—
1914. 1919. 1920. 1921.
Liabilities . . £34,068 £22,150 £25,050 £24,501
Fixed assets . . 61,398 50,207 57,687 59,207
Stocks . . . . 24,028 37,965 52,115 55,131
Book debts . . 27,002 17,731 28,026 21,812
Investments . . 4,000 3,500 3,500 2,500
Cash deposits, etc. 939 3,275 3,683 876
In May, 1920, paid capital was increased
from £75,000 to £lOO,OOO by a new share
issue at par. This was to hnance new tim-
ber interests and more expensive stocks, and
to extend milling and joinery activities. But
the new funds have not reduced liabilities.
However, after payment of the final div.
there was a surplus of stocks, book debts, de-
posits on contracts, etc., over and above ail
liabilities of £53,318, representing almost
10s. Bd. per £l-paid share. There is a further
11s. lOd. in fixed assets, the book values of
which appear to have received adequate
attention as to depreciation. Timber con-
cessions are held on the N. S. Wales North
Coast, in Queensland and Noumea, but their
actual value depends, of course, on the
market which the co. can find for the millings
of those areas. Until conditions become
normal A. and E. Ellis’s profits are not
likely to be fat, and there is small prospect
for some years of another State construc-
tion boom on borrowed money such as
favored the co. in recent years. But having
got through the period of market slump
without experiencing anything worse than
loss of profit, the co.’s position should re-
main fairly comfortable, even if profits don’t
glitter. Of + be £24,501 liabilities at August
31 only £4117 was bank overdraft; the
balance was due on trading accounts.
An effort is being made to revive James
Gitsham’s lead-sulphate works at Launces-
ton, and also to place the process abroad.
Backed chiefly by jam-king Jones, with
£14,000 of local capital and a promise of
£lO,OOO more from London, Gitsham con-
structed works and equipped them with a
higli-power electric furnace and other
patented plant a couple of years ago. The
English crowd, however, came to light with
only £l7OO, so the co. collapsed and the
works are now under the bank’s wing, with
Henry Jones in the offing as guarantor of a
£5OOO overdraft. In view of the world-
rumpus about white-lead, the Gitsham crowd
consider the time opportune for seeking a
hearing for their process, which gives a non-
poisonous product. Reputedly good stuff
on the market nowadays contains from 10
to 20 p.c. soluble lead; Gitsham’s goes less
than 2 p.c. So European Non-Poisonous
White-Lead, Ltd. —in 2500 shares of £5,
1000 of which go to the vendors, 1000 are
offered for subscription, and the balance
are to be held in x-eserve—is being formed
in Sydney to place the process in Europe.
It is pi-oposed to dispatch J. 11. Clegg, who
has successfully tapped Jno. Bull on several
occasions, to trade off the overseas rights.
The prospectus of the co. includes an in-
teresting woi’king account which estimates
profits from a 25-ton-per-week plant, the
figures being based on the Launceston ex-
perience. Ore purchases (at £lO per ton)
would require £250; electrodes, £107; fur-
nace labor-, £75; and power and all other
exes, (including management, depreciation,
realisation charges, etc.) £195. For this
total outlay of £627, 23 tons sulphate worth
£4O per ton and one ton metallic lead worth
£2O are expected—together giving £940.
These estimates show a profit of £312-odd.
It is proposed also to float at an early date
a wholly-Australian co. to produce locally.
This eo. is to take over the Launceston
woi’ks by releasing them from the bank’s
hold. Nominal capital will be £50.000. and
the promoters hope to secure £20,000 of
working capital.

“W’gabba”: The proposal by John Fell to
distil oil from shale in situ at Newnes
(N.S.W.) is not altogether new. It was
tried in pre-war times at one of the Elko
mines in Nevada (U.S.A.). It was not a
commercial success, though oil of a sort was
got. The idea may be “sound theoretically,”
but there are several aspects of the case
besides those mentioned by the “Wild Cat”
(B. 3/11/’2l). Pi-obably the most vital is
the character of the oil produced. The N.
S. Wales experiment may have distilled oil
in quantity beyond expectations, but com-
mercial oil-sliale retorting pi’actiee has made
it axiomatic that there must be a rigid con-
trol of temperatui-e during retorting to pre-
vent an undue percentage of unsaturated
hydrocarbons developing. It is obvious that
in fii-ing a mine the unsaturates will pre-
dominate. and, although watei’-white pro-
ducts may be obtained, the pi-ocess neces-
sary in order to get them is more expensive,
and even then they are more />r less un-
stable. resulting in discoloration. Bad prac-
tice in shale-retorting has spoiled many a
mine, and to leave it to more or less hap-
hazard firing looks like inviting failure.
The Scotch retorts distil at tiie lowest pos-
sible temperature that will decompose the
kerogen ( i.e ., the carbonaceous matter in
the shale carrying the oil), and the oily
vapors are constantly removed to prevent
additional heating. Of course, if the Com-
monwealth will use any old sort of oil it
might be made a success—not otherwise.
Haphazard firing is enormously wasteful;
there is not only the loss of inflammable
gas, which the thrifty Scotch retorter uses
for carrying on distillation, but gas is formed
at the expense of portion of the oily distil-
late if the process is not controlled. Any-
way, it seems a pity to treat the Wolgan
shales, amongst the finest quality* shales in
the world, in this fashion unless the process
can be justified by the fullest possible tests.
When the period of “gushers” comes to an
end N. S. Wales should have a big pull over
American and British shales, for, besides
their higher yields of crude oil, they are re-
markably low in sulphur as compared with
the others. High-grade oils must be nearly
sulphur-free (the British Admiralty’s limit
is 2 p.c.), and one of the unsolved problems
in shale-retorting is the elimination of much
sulphur by a commercially successful pro-
cess. This problem has kept the large
deposits in Norfolk (Eng.)—running from
3 p.c. to 6 p.c.—from being generally worked.
N. S. Wales shale, with something like an
average of 5 p.c. sulphur, will have an im-
mense advantage in the production of the
highest-grade oils when they can be commer-
cially treated on orthodox lines.
* * * *
A warning from an oil-expert:—
There seems to be an attempt to organise an oil
boom, and perhaps some Bulletin readers might
profit from a word in season.
So far as is known, except for the recent Westra-
lian find, there is no record of a surface seepage of
oil in Australia; but, even if there were, it could
not be considered as an infallible indication of the
presence of a commercial oil pool.
Lord Cowdrav (Samuel Pearson) got his first con-
cessions from the Mexican Government in exchange
for railways. The country had numerous seepages
of petroleum, but eight years of solid work with the
drill passed before the field was a proved commercial
success.
Australian D’Arcy, of Mount Morgan fame, and
his associates of the D’Arey Exploration Co., spent
thousands and thousands of pounds in countries like
Persia, where often the ground is literally saturated
with petroleum and seepages are frequent,. before
they got a commercial oil pool.
John Bull has spent £500,000 in oil prospecting
in his own country, although the first petroleum
ever treated for kerosene was procured from a deposit
in the Riddings Colliery in Derby in 1847, and at
Meir Hill, Longton, Staffs., the production of
natural petroleum kept a small refinery at work
there 40 years ago. The production of petroleum
in England is negligible.
The famous Tar Sands of Athabasca, Canada,
cover an area of 2000 sq. miles, and are saturated
with asphalt which is the residue left from an enor-
mous outflow of petroleum, the volatile parts having
evaporated and run off. There is, however, very-
little production in that district. A similar find
here at the present time would probably cost the
public millions of pounds in booms.
That there is oil in Australia is practically cer-
tain, and- likely areas have been mapped ; but the
report of any “oil expert” who has not his word
backed by an independent economic geologist or by
a Government geologist should be taken doubtfully.

On May 31 Bendigo Amalgamated’s liquid
surplus assets stood at £127,665, but when
the old no-liability co. was resolved into a
limited one, shareholders had £75,952 of capi-
tal returned. Since February a blank has
shown almost everywhere, with consequent
heavy losses. In October, 1920, Dyason laid
down the fundamental that £50,000 set aside
for prospecting was the limit of spending “to
meet losses during a possible. interval be-
tween major discoveries.” With the Con-
stellation shoot done, losses piled up from
February on in such style that Dyason now
affirms, in a quarterly report which displaces
the former monthly reviews, that only profit-
earning work, “or at least that which is self-
supporting,” is to be done. High prices of
mine supplies and big labor costs when
working on a half-scale force this decision.
Ahead is the threat of a further jump in
wages, unless Justice Powers decides against
the miners. To allow others to rove around
the field the Amalgamated has surrendered
three of its consolidated leases, including the
Murchison, Catherine Reef and Williams
United leases, as well as the whole of the
Hustlers line. Even with these shed and
the New Moon block passed on to the A 1
crowd the Amalgamated holds the best part
of Bendigo.
This sifting out of leases leaves the
Carlisle, Unity. Northern, Constellation,
Hercules and Monument mines to carry the
hod. In addition to these mines there are
fixed and floating assets which Dyason
assesses as worth £lOO,OOO. There are, be-
sides, £50.000 of liquid assets, and only
small debts. So he declares that there are
realisable worth ss. a share. That
may give some comfort, even if it doesn’t
conceal the fact that the original big amal-
gamation was in the main a dud. Carlisle,
Unity and Constellation alone have been
successes. The first is pretty well out of
assured profit-bearing stone, and the Con-
stellation is worked dry. Unity can g-ve
5-sdwt. stone from the Victory channel,
where there is room still for a surprise both
tor it and for the Carlisle. The Northern is
a stringer, but there Dyason hopes to get a
run of gold on the McDuff spurs. This is
old ground. Far more promising country is
that being broken on the Derby line north
and south of Collmann’s fauit. Some of
Bendigo’s best gold has been got there, so
that if the zone theory holds good it is a
part of the field that should be held on to
longest. Hercules has been another pearl
of the right lustre, and at 1320 ft. and 1440 ft.
the big formation being attacked looks like
putting currants in Amalgamated’s damper.
Monument Hill has 400 ft. of stone opened
up, and though the grade is irregular it is
sufficient to encourage. Dyason sums up as
follows:
It can be said that never in the history of the
co. has it had so many promising prospecting- works
m hand, and, should one or two of these justify
the reasonable expectations held, operations should
sh°w gi'Mtlv improved returns, and in due time it
should be possible again to extend the scope of the
co.’s work, at any rate, to the scale which prevailed
until the recent curtailment.
He robs this pleasant picture of most of its
rosy tints by declaring that “in order to
permit of the continuance of mining work”
substantial yields must come from one or
other of the prospects within a compara-
tively short time.
* * * *
The preliminary statement about the
year’s work at Mount Lyell is a cock-a-
whoop justification of the policy assumed
towards labor six months ago. Copper has
kept low all the year, but a net profit of
£51,830 shows against £76,007, earned in
1920, when things on the whole were better
for metals and for fuel. A fair bit of profit
came from the superphosphate business, and
improvements in smelting methods also
helped, xne dust-up with the unions was,
after all, a blessing in disguise. Most of
the Reds made for the mainland, believing
that the mine would remain idle. With
them off the job, the alternate 40- aiid 48-
hour working week has had a fair go. Re-
sults are the happiest; the men have worked
well, and the co. has been able to cut out a
wasteful half-day on Saturdays. The profit
shown above was after writing off £48,590
for depreciation of plant (compared with
£47,582 fo” 1920), and £4459 was allocated
to the prospecting and development account.
Arthur Clarke, of Cairns, has at last
succeeded in merging the Oaks and Thomp-
son’s Oaks. Tne low-grade field should
long ago have been worked by one big co.,
but the owners of the various shows opened
their mouths too wide when an effort was
made to effect a consolidation, and the Oaks
Rush float failed. Just prior to the war
Thompson’s was floated, and the directors
of both it and the Oaks co. proposed a link-
ing-up ; but war difficulties intervened. The
field has had a remarkable career during the
abnormal period; notwithstanding the low-
grade material available and high costs,
both shows have been almost continuously
at work, though tribute syndicates of share-
holders have been operating them lately. With
the five head added by its tribute syndicate,
the Oaks now has 15-head of stamps;
Thompson’s has no battery. The directors
contemplate the erection of a 40-head bat-
tery and the construction of a weir on the
Copperfield River. Other shows on the field
are also to receive attention, notably the
Oak Apple; which is expected to give big
tonnages of 4dwt. to Bdwt. ore, and this
stuff when mixed with the 2dwt. to 2£dwt.
stone from the Oaks open-cuts may put the
amalgamated proposition on a payable basis.
Also there is some 3oz. stone in the Thomp-
son bottom workings to aid bulk crushings.
Shareholders in both shows have agreed to
the amalgamation proposals. Oaks Consoli-
dated will have a nominal capital of
£75,000, in 150,000 shares of 10s. each, and
should all old holders apnly for their por-
tions of the issues—for their old scrip they
are offered a number of fully-paids and con-
tribs. —paid capital would be as follows:
34,063 fully-paids, 83,950 pref. contribs. paid
to 2s. 4d. when 4d. per share is paid on
allotment, and 28,550 more pref. contribs.
paid to 3s. sd. on nayment of 2d. per share.
That would leave 3437 ordinaries in reserve.
But not all the old holdings are likely to be
converted; the directors reckon they can
reorganise successfully if only 60,000 con-
tribs. are taken up.
The Ida and Comet lodes, on the Palmer
River (N.Q.), are to be run over with a
drill by Jim Watters to see if there is any
gold left below water-level by the old
miners. These shows have not seen a pick
since about 188 S. Boring on gold reefs can
be very misleading, owing to the thickness
of the stone and the values constantly chang-
ing. Much drilling was done on the Tow-
ers during its decline, but nothing worth
while was ever got. The Palmer was the
fourth-best field in the Northern State, and
it is hard to believe that the gold all petered
°J*t at 500 ft. There is an old battery on
the field that can be tuned up if payable
ore is struck.
North Kalgurli (W.A.) has issued a
report in London showing liquid assets of
over Bd. per share. The show lias given
about £300,000 worth of gola, but most of it
has been won by tribute parties. Share-
holders, who have had to face one or two re-
constructions, have never received anything,
and unless the liquidator is promptly called
in probably never will.
Hampton Areas, Ltd., which, backed by
Lionel Robinson and others, acquired Block
18 and other areas from the down-and-out
Hampton Uruguay Co. last year, shows re-
sources of about £70,000 (equal to 3s. 6d
per share). Nothing is said in the latest
report about the Board’s alleged intention to
acquire outright, or buy into, some new min-
ing enterprises elsewhere.
* * * *
The last nail seems to have been driven
into Gt. Fingall’s coffin. Following upon the
water rising in the workings to 800 ft., the
collapse beneath the sand dump let into the
mine hundreds of thousands of tons of resi-
dues which lifted the flood to the 7th level
<lnd nearly drowned the tribute party delving
there. Attempts were made to unwater the
show to the point where the remaining pay-
able values are, but they failed. During its
life Fingall produced nearly 1J million oz. of
gold, and paid over two millions in dividends.
* * * *
Quicksilver production in Maoriland is be-
coming an established industry. Develop-
ment work at the Whangarei mines is now
directed, under Government advice, towards
opening up a large ore reserve to justify the
purchase and installation of a Thronhill
wet-process plant to replace the present obso-
lete furnace. A considerable tonnage of the
shivery metal has been produced by the co.,
but the distillation process is very wasteful
and not suitable for the complete recovery
of the metallic content of the somewhat re-
fractory ore.

John Nobbs, one of the best-known figures
in the N. S. Wales Parliament, has gone
west at 76. He was a Sydney native, born
on Surry Hills, where his father, also John,
had a market-garden. In 1850 dad gave
up growing cabbages and took over the
Gardeners’ Arms Hotel in York-street,
which had been the property of Joseph
Nobbs, his father; and from there he went
to the Swan with Two Necks in George-
street. John, the son, was educated as a
conveyancer, a profitable occupation before
Torrens Act came in. He entered the Leg.
Ass. in 1888 as member for Central Cum-
berland, and sat for that constituency in
two Parliaments. The House saw him again
in 1908, when he was elected for Granville.
Defeated in 1913 by present-Treasurer Lang,
he was a few years later given a
seat in the Council, and held it until his
death. He hardly ever spoke in the House,
and once, when he had burst into a three-
line speech, Paddy Crick reproved him for
his loquacity. He was one of the earliest
residents of what was known as “Parra-
matta Junction,” and it was he who pro-
posed that it should be called Gladstone;
but the postal authorities objected, as there
was already a Gladstone. So “Granville”
was chosen to commemorate another English
Parliamentarian. As a colonist Joseph
Nobbs, John’s grandfather, dated back to
pre-Macquarie days.
THOMAS HENLEY, N.S. Wales M.L.A.,
who sees the Scarlet Lady in his dreams.
Before lie went into a sharebroker’s office
Peaeock, Victoria’s Minister for Education,
was a teacher at the Creswick Grammar
School, of which he had previously been a
pupil. It was as a small boy that he made
liis first speech in public—he led a deputa-
tion which saw in the birth of the head-
master’s first child a good chance for a holi-
day. And he talked until he gained his
point. It was also at this school that he met
his first reverse as an elocutionist. He was
reciting at a break-up and suddenly squashed
an egg which had been placed in his pocket.
The mushy stuff got over his hand and
clothes and so perturbed him that he lost
his lines and retired a blushing failure.
George Buckland, who succeeds Bill Lam-
bert as secretary of the central branch of
the A.W.U. in N. S. Wales, started life at
Mount Hope. As a boy he worked in a
mine near Cobar, and at 18 he became paid
secretary of the Amalgamated Miners’
Union at Wrightville, outside Cobar. At
21 he was Mayor of that hamlet. When the
A.M.A. came into the A.W.U. George filled
a secretary’s chair in Sydney, and after-
wards he was placed in charge of the
A.W.U.’s mining branch.
Pastoral and grazing families in the West-
ern District of Vic. heard with a pang of
the death of James Oman, one of an ener-
getic, enterprising and brainy quartette of
brothers. He was only 39. An operation
at a Camperdown private hospital was tried,
but it was unavailing. Governor Stradbroke
wired his condolences to his Minister of
Lands, who is another of the four.
Edwards, of the Labor party, has unex-
pectedly been championing in the S. Aus.
Assembly the cause of Goodman, manager of
the Tramways Trust of Adelaide. The Pre-
mier replied t o
pressing inquiries
that Goodman has
been and still is
ill; and an official
return showed that
leave has been
given him this
year for the fol-
lowing reasons :
Official business,
46 days; recreation
leave, 21; sick
leave, 34: leave
without salary (to
report on the
Brisbane tram-
ways), 59 days;
and he has just
started on three
months’ sick leave.
Edwards referred

EDWARD
MITCHELL, K.C.,
leader of the Vic.
Bar.
Worn out with teaching and pastoral
work, Father James O’Connlor, S.J'.,
answered the call last week at Xavier Col-
lege, Ivew (Vic.). He was known to
generations of students who went through
Xavier or St. Pat’s (Vic.) and Riverview
(N.S.W.). Most of them called him
“Dad,” and that told its own tale. He
was 44 when he came to Australia 36 years
ago, and entered the Order 60 years since.
Dr. Norman Markwell, for six years M.O.
on Thursday Island, has gone abroad to
study psychiatry. On T.I. he had about 12
official jobs, but 20 official jobs wouldn’t
have crushed his- sense of humor and dislike
of red-tape. He intends to return to Syd-
ney.
J. W. Partridge, dead in Adelaide at 80,
was a nephew of G. M. Waterhouse, famous
for having been Premier first in South Aus.,
and then in Maoriland. As a youth Part-
ridge managed his uncle’s Highercombe
estate in the Adelaide hills, but moved south
with him and was a station-manager in the
Wairarapa district and afterwards at Castle
Point. But he had been back living quietly
near Adelaide for nearly 30 years.
Publican M. Collins didn’t sit long in Mel-
bourne City Council. He got in at a by-
election a few months ago as a Labor man,
and when he had to face the ratepayers the
o,ther day he was dropped. Edward Campbell,
jun., “the citizens’ candidate,” managed to get
in front by 72 votes. As recently as August
30 Collins failed to beat Farthing for the
Leg. Assembly seat for East Melbourne. With
these tw r o set-backs he will hardly be ready
to run for the Melbourne seat in the Leg.
Council when McWliae resigns to take the
Agent-Generalship. Pearson, another Boni-
face and good Labor stand-by, will also
probably be found unwilling. L. J. Hayes,
Labor’s choice, challenged David Bell, the
retiring Liberal for Vic. Ward in the City
Council, but was beaten by 517. The news
that has come over regarding the doings of
Sydney City Council under Labor rule has
plainly scared the Melbourne ratepayers.
Not another old ’un was displaced.
“Chin Strap” : Aarons might be worth a
place bet in the alphabetical list of Diggers,
but my money is on Lieut. N. Aagaard, of
the Ist Divvy machine-gunners, for a win.
An old seaman proposes to came to anchor
at an old port. The Railway Hotel at Port
Elliott (S.A.), just outside the Murray
mouth, has been bought by Capt. Edgar L.
Adams, who did his bit in the mercantile
marine during the war, and before that was
with Douglas Mawson in the Antarctic.
Grant Hervey has become desperately
serious. He wires to The Bulletin from
Melbourne to say that he reallv never did join
in that West Sydney electioneering cornedv
which a correspondent talked about (B.
10/11/’2l). “I was never concerned in any
anti-Catholic candidature whatever, neither
have I ever joined the R.C. Church. I
have nothing but the kindest feelings to-
wards all churches,” Hervey wires; and, of
course, nothing to the contrary was sug-
gested.
Concerning a little Australian who sleeps
in Gallipoli, and who, as Bean’s book shows,
was one of the real heroes of the Landing:—
“Skipper” (B. 29/9/’2l) says that of the First Divi-
sion officers at the Landing- Captain J. P. Lalor was
the only one who hung on to his sword. No wonder !
This Lalor was a grandson of the Peter Lalor, and the
sword that he took to the Peninsula had belonged
to his grandad. An odd thing occurred when he
was being examined for the A. and I. Staff. His
French examination was nearly his ruin: he only
just managed to pass. And yet he had served five
years in a French unit—he was with the Foreign
Legion—and understood French as well as he did
English.
John Hobson, known to Sydney sub-
editors as a voluminous letter-writer, has
penned his last screed. An inventor of sorts,
he made a living by patenting such small
deer as corkscrews and dust-bin covers ; but
he had large ideas. One of the schemes on
which he set his heart was the connecting of
the Speck and the mainland by a bridge held
in air by balloons, and supported on the
south end by anchors and steel chains.
Another idea was to stock Centralia with
wild beasts, particularly lions, tigers and
elephants, and batten on the sportsmen of
the earth. He had great plans for ending
the war by hocussing the German beer sup-
ply, and expedients of that sort. But the
Censor callously vetoed them, and Hobson
lost heart.
Norman Lindsay’s schooldays were
blessed, for most of them were occupied in
playing truant and in getting out a school
paper, occupations which were often closely
associated. In the joyful manner which has
never left him he would throw his school-
bag over his .shoulder, call out “Good-bye”
to the household, leave the house ‘by
the door, and return almost immedi-
ately by the window leading into his bed-
room. Norman was editor, illustrator,
newsgetter, printer, publisher and every-
thing else of The Boomerang. A gelatine
pad was the machinery, and Norman himself
delivered copies every week to the 30-odd
boys of the Creswick Grammar School who
promised to pay a penny. Text-books were
also illustrated, and though he displayed a
complete ignorance of and an almost violent
abhorrence of dates and other dull facts
which did not stir the imagination, his illus-
trations showed that he had a greater insight
into the periods dealt with than his masters
or schoolfellows would ever possess. He was
15 then, and. had reached the period immedi-
ately preceding his departure to Melbourne
to make his fortune—or, at any rate, 10 bob
a week.
The story of the late George Robertson’s
business career was recently told again in a
Melbourne daily; but in mentioning that the
busy bookseller retired from active connec-
tion with the firm after 40 years of it, the
historian omitted one fact which might have
pointed a moral and given some gloomy
interest to the tale. George Robertson re-
tired as a widower of 65, with nothing much
to occupy his mind save the construction of
a fine, roomy family vault in St. Kilda
Cemetery. He anticipated his brither Scot,
David Syme, in a display of solicitude about
his burying-place. The vault cost more
than a thousand pounds, and its system of
ventilation was perfect. Heaven onlv knows
why a bookseller who was apparently quite
prepared to be boxed one day in a hermeti-
cally-sealed coffin should be so particular
about getting fresh air into the box-cupboard ;
but it is a fact that vent tubes ran from the
tomb to the margin of distant sidewalks.
Any initiated youth of the period would in-
vite a friend to admire the beauties of
George Robertson’s mausoleum. Then,
whilst the stranger was considering the un-
certainty of life, the youth would murmur
“Boo” into a ventilation pipe, with the re-
sult that a sound like 10 demons would
reverberate within the vault. George Robert-
son survived the gruesome recreation .some
pars, and presumably lived to catch a small
boy m the act of playing larks with hi*
tutiire resting-place. In which case he had
the satisfaction of catching the kid bending.
The squabble between Basil Thomson,

“Ali Selim” meets a monarch out of a job:
Our gallant allies the Portuguese have had their
annual revolution, but Manoel is still a king in exile.
His loving former subjects won’t have the painful
young man on their minds. I saw Manoel in London
in 1917. He was resolutely doing his bit in a
Red Cross bazaar. A tiny chap, much like a well-
nourished Charlie Chaplin, he was being toted about
by his stout, stolid German wife, who obviously had
him well in hand. Whatever the truth about his
relations with poor Gaby Deslys such expensive
ladies are quite beyond his income now. In that
respect, however, he is not much worse off than
monarchs who still sit on their thrones. Even
Alphonso, it is said, is finding it difficult to keep up
with the war profiteer in the fierce race for the favors
of beautiful but mercenary females. When Manoel was
not at the movies, for which, like Karl, late of
Austria, he has a boyish passion, he was obediently
trotting round Red Cross depfits in the wake of his
large wife and still more massive mother. Queen Anielie
was “helping” one day at the Wandsworth Hospital
and the kinglet called. “Good day,” he said to a
stolid Tommy orderly, “may I see my momma ?”
“Oo the is your momma?” replied Thomas, run-
ning an eye over the charwomen within his imme-
diate field of vision.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” harks back to
the exploring days :
Tire recent death of Mrs. William Landsborough,
at Toowong (Q.), recalls an afternoon in November,
1862, at the Melbourne Exhibition building (the Mint
is on the site), when a silver tea and coffee service
and a silver salver, valued at £5OO, w'ere presented
on behalf of his Queensland admirers to the explorer.
Gov. Henry Barkly was there in all his glory, and
members of the Royal Society were in strong force.
Landsborough had headed one of the expeditions sent
out to find Burke and Wills, and he received an
address in honor of that feat. Other relief expedi-
tions were led by liyte, Norman, Howitt and McKin-
lay, who were on the platform with Landsborough,
and they got addresses, too. liyte, I recall, was
of meagre build ; Howitt something better; but Lan-
dells (who had been a member of the Burke
and Wills party, but left it), Norman, Lands-
borough and Mcliinlay were fine men. I
saw Burke and Wills depart from the Royal
Park, August 20, 1860. I saw the return of John
King, the sole survivor, who was brought in by
Howitt. I saw the public funeral, and was present
that night in St. George’s Hall when the Explora-
tion Committee, with Barkly in the chair, gave an
account of its stewardship to a meeting that, at the
outset, was very rowdy. I also saw the bronze statue
of the two explorers cast in the studio of Summers,
the sculptor, in Colli ns-otreet, and saw it unveiled
and dedicated by Governor Charles Darling at the
intersection of Russell and Collins streets. It has
since been removed to a site in Spring-street.
In 1902 Minns did a well-remembered
drawing of two love-struck abos.—“Close
up Marry Now, Mine Tinkit”—which after-
wards was made into a postcard and sold
by the thousand. Nineteen years have passed,
and now Minns has done another front
page drawing for a Christmas Bulletin
—“Too Much Married Now, Mine Tinkit.”
There are more than two abos. in this
drawing, which will be printed with contri-
butions by Norman Lindsay, Leason, Low
and all the other best-known black-and-
white artists. And there are 25 short stories
—as good a lot as have ever been got to-
gether in Australia. The publishing date
is Saturday, December 10.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Noise of the busy kitchen,
Clatter of pot and pan,
And Margot is baking golden loaves
As only Margot can;
Slim brown arms, swift-moving,
Kissed to the same gold ten —
Ah, a woman was queen of her kitchen
Ere ever the reign of man!
But up on the hill there’s a breeze that calls,
And the brown arms halt a-quiver.
Is she sensing the slow, sweet ecstasy
That sets the grass a-shiver
With that thought in her dream-filled eyes ?
No! She’s merely forgotten to turn the bread
And is wondering if it will rise!
Gleam and glow of the candles
On silver and glass and wine,
And laughter that swells and eddies
Where youth and joy combine;
And just where the window arches
She is sitting, my wife, Margot,
Queen of the mirth and the laughter,
Tossing them to and fro.
But out of the arch of the window
The pale stars tremble and burn,
Calling the gypsy in me
To the road of no-return;
And a masterful moon is riding the skies
And tearing my heart in twain—
Ah, mate of my youth, mv Margot,
Do you dream of this sweet, mad pain,
With your restless glance on the window
And a shade on the lips that laughed,
When you ask me to draw the curtains
To shut out the “horrid draught” ?

SOCIETY
AFTER JUDGING DAY.
THE GENIUS: “I didn't mind, so much the
beasts chucking my miniature, but it
was the reason they gave.”
THE FRIEND: “What was it?”
THE GENIUS : “Insufficient wall-space!”
“Lemau”: In mandated New Guinea we
are not improving on the German method of
hanging. One thing the Germans made cer-
tain of was death, quick and painless. I
was present recently when tw-o “boys” were
to be executed. They were done to death
in different villages. The only difference
was that the first victim did not know what
was in front of him, whilst the second saw
the whole performance as a sort of rehearsal.
The German method, which we have adopted,
was to put a rope under the armpits to hoist
the victim, with a rope around the neck
to do the trick. Slack is allowed on the neck
rope to give a sufficient drop when the breast
rone is cut. On this occasion twice the boy
hit the ground owing to too long a drop
being allowed, and it was only on the third
shot that the executioners were success-
ful. True, the third drop was too short,
but the boy was strangled all right. Shoot-
ing would have been far more merciful. The
second victim made a bolt for liberty before
his turn came. Both were executed for
killing unfaithful wives, a tribal custom of
centuries standing. Under the Germans, im-
prisonment would have been their lot.
“S.C.M. Largs”: For the Queer Epitaph
Stakes this is a starter from the Pt. Victor
(S.A.) cemetery:—
A deep-rooted cancer set in my breast,
It gave me much pain, and little rest.
It baffled five good doctors’ skill,
And landed me on Zion’s hill.
* * * *
“S. Snell”: When I was a lad of 15 I
worked for a farmer named McDougal.
(Never work for a farmer named McDougal
if you can get a job as a departmental head
in the civil service.) McDougal was a dour
man with “the saving grace” strongly de-
veloped. One night we were coming
through Buninyong returning from Bal-
larat after disposing of a load of spuds
when an alarm of fire shook that primitive
centre, and we observed a mass of smoke
emerging from one of three small adjoining-
shops. Three energetic youths proceeded
to break the window of the middle shop, a
grocery, and set themselves to work saving
the stock. McDougal with great considera-
tion and remarkable alacrity joined in the
work of salvage. He rescued (if I remem-
ber rightly) a box of currants, a bag of oat-
meal, two tins of biscuits, and some candles
and tinned fish and placed the lot in his wag-
gon for safe keeping. Presently when we drove
on the salvage was still with us. McDougal
took it all the way home without discover-
ing his error, and, when we were unloading.
“Man,” said he reverently, “it’s the Loord’s
mercy it wasna all burnt awa’ younder.”
Next day came the information that there was
really no fire, and that the greatest mischief
had been done by too officious people at-
tempting to save the stock. McDougal
looked towards the goods safely stowed
away, shook his head, sighed deeply, and
said, “Ah, laddie, laddie, this’ll tak’ a power
o’ prayin’ about.”
“The Oldest Inhabitant” among the oldest
pubs:—
Another bit of old Sydney, though it wears a
new dress, has changed hands at £44,500 —the Pitt-
street front of the Royal Arcade, which is in the
estate of the late Richard and Henrietta Hill. The
Hills have been in Pitt-street for a century. Wil-
liam ran the Butchers’
Arms; George, the
Carpenters’ Arms;
David, the Wheel-
wrights’ Arms —all in
Pitt-street. Daniel kept
the William the Fourth
in Sussex-street; and
Richard, in whose
estate the Arcade was,
followed his trade of
carpenter in the same
street. Henrietta was
one of the three daugh-
ters of Francis Cox,
who, in the very early
days, had a smithy
close to what is now
Circular Quay. An-
other of the Cox girls
became Mrs. W. C.
Wentworth, and a
third was Mrs. Bloods-
worth, who kept the
William the Fourth
after David moved to
the Butchers’ Arms.
Richard Hill died at
85 in the Bent-street
property, which is still
in the family. There
is a Henrietta-terrace
in Phillip-street. That
was —1 think still is
—Hill property, named
after the lady above mentioned.

“Tin Hat”: The little gold pass supplied
to Federal members has its disadvantages.
Senator “Pompey” Elliott, on his way to un-
veil an honor roll at Whittlesea (Vic.),
flashed the medallion at the Spencer-street
barrier and hopped into a train. Melbourne
was 10 miles behind when he discovered that
he was on the Sydney express, travelling in
the wrong direction, and with the first stop
over 50 miles in front. Being “Pompey,” he
had the express halted at the next station,
where he hired a car to finish his trip. But
for once he must have wished that he had
been an ordinary bloke and bought a ticket,
in which case he would have got no closer
to the wrong train than the examiners at the
barrier.
*** . *
Another dominie differs ;
I can’t agree with “Country Ped” (B. 3/11/’2l)
that a child’s love of tragedy is “a survival of the
joy our ancestors found in slaughter.” It is doubtful
whether a child has any real affection for tragedy.
It appeals to him considerably less than comedy.
After the show ask him which picture he enjoyed
most. It’s a wheat farm to a patch of desert it
WHERE ARE WE?
“Surfing improves the figure, don't yon think ?"
“ Oh, surely! How long have you been surfing?”
wasn’t “East Lynne’’ or “The Face at the Window,”
but Charlie Chaplin. When a child thinks in
tragedy the reason can generally be found in his
environment. Environment is a tremendous factor
all through. The pupils of my class reside in a
Sydney suburb famous (or notorious) for its racing
stables and its boiling-down works. Recently I
asked for a composition on the horse. Sixty per
cent, confined their lucubrations to racehorses. Of
these two-thirds sent their heroes to spend the even-
ing of their lives in well-watered, grassy paddocks.
The remainder carted their heroes to the boiling-
down works. Investigation showed that the “happy-
ending” authors were the sons of successful trainers,
while the morbid-minded biographers were the off-
spring of trainers not so fortunate.
“Ex-Dig.”: Armistice Day produced a
harvest of A.W.L. in the A.I.F. Weeks
elapsed before all the patients in the Aus-
tralian hospitals were back again in their
wards; and one whole training depot emp-
tied itself, and had to be pacifically repopu-
lated. But the quaintest absentee was a little
typiste at A.I.F. headquarters, London.
Fluffy was an enthusiastic war worker with
plenty of money, and when the bells of vic-
tory rang she decided to give some of it a
fly. After a week had whizzed by she was
pursued with the salary still due to her and
asked the reason for her non-appearance.
A SUPERIOR ANIMAL.
“I think you're a puffed-up cat!”
“Well, that's not as bad as being a rouged-
up vixen!”
“Oh, isn’t the war over?” she asked in sur-
prise. t #
“St. Pancras” (Lond.) : It really was
time Northcliffe either went himself or sent
the Daily Mail messenger-boy to Australia.
No other paper in London talks so much
(considering the space available) about “the
Dominions” ; none knows less about them.
It “starred” the boss’s “Warning to Aus-
tralia” on Oct. 3—that was just when he
was leaving for the North —and illuminated
the remarks by a population map showing
that Melbourne has 84,309 inhabitants, Adel-
aide 32,981 and Sydney 32,104. The entire
population of the continent, you will be
glad to know, has now reached 2,168,000.

“Lex” : S.A. Supreme Court has confirmed
the finding of Adelaide Police Court that
there is no way of making fortune-telling
lawful in this State. The “Madame” in the
case had insisted on the client signing a
declaration form prepared in advance by a
lawyer—that a mere “entertainment” was
proposed. Chief Justice Murray decided
that this was futile. “To call it an amuse-
ment or an entertainment when it is prac-
tised as a means of gaining a livelihood \
not alter its character. It is the idevdeu.
evil under another name.” But beciuv e an
English decision —since over-ri '
have led the prisoner to suppos- : :
tice is safe so long as the client is ,
ally deceived, the fine was rerlrn t to
nominal figure.
Prof. Osborne solemnly announced at a
meeting of the Vic. “Head Mis-
tresses’ Association and Parents’
National Educational Union” that
there was a mild epidemic of re-
volt from the long period of repres-
sion of children. This “curious
symptom of modern psychology
might end in a scandal or in a
wave of fear and dread overtaking
the whole community.” One lady
thought infants ought to be trained
to “self-control” before they were
two, for if thoroughly broken then
they wouldn’t cause any trouble
afterwards. The situation is grave.
The revolt of woman was bad
enough when she left home, and
even banged the door in her hus-
band’s face; but that was only a
circumstance compared with the
revolt of the three-
year-olds who chyack
the old man. study
Freud, patronise only
advanced pictures and
insist on “living their
own life,” substitut-
ing for the feeding-
bottle of virtue the
ice-cream of vice.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos child answers. A
friend in charge of a small school .Bathurst
way was giving a lesson on the Creation. Hav-
ing exhausted the first six days she asked,
“What did God do on the seventh day?” Up
shot a hand. “Please, Miss, He took a
spell.”

WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Such little things I love, I love!
The silver bark on poplar-trees,
A broken boat beside faint seas,
And amber shells;
The sound of bells
At noon, the drone of summer bees;
A Wedgwood jug, a garnet hoop,
Red hops aflame upon a hill,
And leaping fires. But, better still,
The little children strong and brow u,
That come from school, and dance a-down
The road that loops before my sill!
I love their loosened hair that streams
Behind them on the romping breeze;
The down upon their dimpled knees,
Their laughter high,
Their voices shy,
As they play ’neath the almond-trees;
And just the way they kneel beside
The sunny, grass-embroidered pool,
And splash among the waters cool
To make the shining rushes shake.
And yet I think my heart will break
As they come laughing out from school.
For most of all I love, I love,
The dream-child l would call my own.
So brown her cheeks, her hair how blown !
Sometimes I feci
Her fingers steal
Along my throat when I lie lone;
And fancy ere my pulse has stilled
That in her starry eyes I see
The sky, and sun and wind set free.
I had this moment rather die

Rivals in beauty
WHY not? There are too
few years between
youth and babyhood
to work noticeable changes in a
girl’s skin. But a fresh, smooth
complexion should keep its beauty
long after girlhood’s days have
passed. Give your skin the same
care that you lavish on your
baby’s, and the charm of alluring
freshness will still be yours when
she has grown up.
You wouldn’t dream of letting a
day pass without a thorough
cleansing with mild, pure soap.
(Most mothers use PALM-
OLIVE.)
Treat your complexion in the
same careful way and the rough-
ness, the little blemishes and the
coarseness of texture which so
many women try to cover up with
powder will soon be transformed
into becoming freshness.
What Every Complexion Needs
Once every day your skin must be
gently but thoroughly cleansed
from all accumulations of dirt,
perspiration and excess oil secre-
tions. Powder and rouge must be
removed, traces of
cold cream washed
away. Every tiny
pore must be freed
from clogging ac-
cumulations so that
the network of
minute glands can
do their necessary
work.
Neglect this daily cleansing, or
depend upon cold cream alone,
and dirt, oil, perspiration, powder,
rouge and the cream itself com-
bine in an impervious coat which
smothers your natural complexion.
The result is sluggishness, which
soon results in a lifeless, sallow
skin. Blackheads develop, dirt
infections produce pimples, the
filled-up pores enlarge into un-
attractive coarseness.
Such a skin is a disfigurement
which cosmetics can’t conceal.
Simple cleansing once a day will
quickly cure it.
You M\»st Use Soap and Water
There is no other safe, quick,
satisfactory cleanser. Your baby’s
skin proves this.
Mild soap, of course, balmy and
soothing, which means PALM-
OLIVE SOAP. Its profuse,
creamy lather is the scientific
blend of palm and olive oils, the
mild gentle cleansers Cleopatra
used.
If your skin is oily apply this
cosmetic lather, massaging it
thoroughly into every
tiny skin cell until not a
trace of foreign matter
remains.
If your skin is inclined to
dryness apply a little cold
cream before you start
cleansing. This keeps the
most sensitive skin
delightfully soft and
smooth. You will like the
feel of being clean with
PALMOLIVE SOAP.

“Billy T.”: There is no longer any pre-
tence of observing the law which abolishes,
or is supposed to abolish, woman’s rights in
the betting ring at Flemington, and the
sportive dame and the speculative maiden
push their money at the Bag just as
openly as their male connections. My
friend Hammerstein had to assure one
pert miss of about 17 that 10 shillings was
his irreducible minimum, but finally he took
her five shillings cn David at sixes to one
to get rid of her. He didn’t: she hung about
till Ham. beefed out a hoarse protest. “Vy
don’t you take a little valk, miss? You
don’d vant to hank rount here bringingk der
Johns down on me—vat?” But the lass
refused to budge. “Oh, I’ve heard what you
bookmakers are,” she said, “and I am going
to stay here. And what’s more, Mr. Ham-
merstein, if you move away and attempt to
interfere with David’s jockey I shall tell
the police.” Hammerstein swallowed his
Adam’s apple and then gasped: “My tear
youngk laty, von’t you let me buy der

A story of the censorship :
In Melbourne Northcliffe flatly contradicted the
statement of Auous-editor Cunningham that the
censorship was worse here than in England. Well,
I hope it was. It was this bad, anyway. I was
in Brisbane when the Germans were making things
very hot for our chaps in France. At that time
the Darling Downs had more Germans to the square
mile than seemed necessary, even in peace time,
and it was said that all sorts of anti-Allied demon-
strations were going on. On behalf of one of the
papers, I went to the Downs to make inquiries, and,
finding that the reports were substantially true, I
wrote the first of a series of special articles. It
told how Britishers were almost daily assaulted by
bands of Deutschland farmers, how it was common
to hear “Thj Watch on the Rhine” sung defiantly
TOO MANY COOKS.
“Oh, cook, I promised mother I would help
you in the kitchen to-day.”
“I wish you would leave it until to-morrow,
miss; Eve got too much to do to-day.”
at any old time, how services in the German tongue
were held in numerous Lutheran churches —a dis-
tinct breach of the regulations—and how meetings
refused to disperse at the command of the police.
Indeed, it was the police who were dispersed often
enough. The editor was pleased. He planned to
make a display of the news and ask the Depart-
ment why it allowed such things to go on. It
was to be a scoop of considerable dimensions. But
it wasn’t. The article came hack from the Censor’s
office with the fatal brand upon it and a communi-
cation to the effect that “at this juncture it is not
considered advisable to arouse feeling against the
Germans io Australia.”
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
THE FAIR ONE: “Jack says Gwen treats him like a dog.”
HER FRIEND: “Ah, but is the treatment general or particular?”
THE FAIR ONE: “What do you mean?”
HER FRIEND: “Docs she treat him like her dog?”
A few Australians can say that they
met Hara, the murdered Prime Minister of
Japan. Among them is a young woman,
now in Nippon, who forwards a translation
of an article in the Japanese Ftjjin Sekai,
in which Ilara’s domestic life is freely dis-
cussal. liis first wife was “the flower-like
daughter of Nakai, an eccentric public offi-
cial and poet.” For a time the marriage
was ideally happy ; then Ilara fell gradually
under the spell of Asa-Ko, a geisha, who
affected the company of politicians, and poor
Mrs. Hara, after suddenly being seized with
severe hysterics, left home. Followed the
divorce of Hara from his flower-lilte wife
and his subsequent marriage to Asa-Ko.
Apparently geishas are as seductive to
Japanese politicians as our tea-shop wait-
resses to the Australian variety. Of the
10 Prime Ministers Japan has bad since
18S5 three have married geishas.

“Caversham”: At Bridgetown (W.A.) re-
cently an elderly dignitary of the Anglican
Church was married for the second
time. His eldest son performed the cere-
mony for papa, and the second son (also
a parson) was best man. The bride, quite
a young woman, came all the way from
England to wed her venerable lad.
“Tuart”: The report that a man had died
in Brisbane of pneumonic plague led Dr.
Armstrong, head of the N. S. Wales Health
Department, to state that only three cases of
pneumonic were on record in Australia —-
they occurred at Balmain in 190 G. He is
wrong. There was a worse outbreak at
Geraidton (W.A.) the same year. And all
the patients went under.

“McNorth” on two leviathans :—•
Max Assman, the little German trader who for
many years had a copra-station at Lese, Gulf of
Papua, owned a couple of small sailing craft with
histories. One was an incredibly tiny, half-decked
affair, very roughly built and sheathed with flat
galvanised-iron. She was secretly built by two
convicts in New Caledonia, who stole the iron for the
sheathing. It is not known where they planned to
escape to, but a year or so after their flight the
boat was found stranded on the beach near the
Warira River, in the northern division of Papua.
There was no sign of the escapees, and a patrol
officer learnt that one had vanished over the German
border and the other had made a meal for the local
natives. Assman bought the boat at auction and
used her for- carrying copra and sago along the Gulf
shore. She was known as the Ironclad. The other
vessel was the Sunbeam, a seven-tonner which carried
many of the miners, from Moresby to the Lakekamu
in the gold rush. She was sailed from Sydney to
Moresby by McGowan and A’Becket. McGowan was
an ex-London Times man who had forsaken the Inky
Way to go adventuring in the South Seas with
Kerry in the Ariadne, the yacht notorious, among
other things, for an episode concerning the lonely
island of Tristan D’Acunha and a shipment of Bibles
that was never delivered, Kerry had gone to London
and collected a dozen or more young bloods with
the desire and capital, particularly the capital, for
an alleged trading-and-pleasure trip to the Islands;
but when they reached Sydney the expedition broke
up and the disillusioned adventurers, with one
exception, returned to England. The exception
was McGowan. He had set out for the Islands, and
to the Islands he would go. Becoming acquainted
with A’Beeket, he purchased the Sunbeam, loaded
her with trade-goods, and the pair set out for New
Guinea. At Moresby McGowan parted from
A’Becket, shipped a native crew, sailed down the
Gulf of Papua and started a trading-station. But
the journalist was too interested in the strange new
life about him to be a success as a trader, and after
a time he sold the Sunbeam to Assman and started
a bowstring hemp plantation a few miles up the
Lakekamu River—a rotten place full of mosquitoes
and fever, where he died. The Sunbeam still sails
New Guinea waters, but Assman is no more. He
died at sea aboard her, and the native crew put
him in a canoe they were towing and set it adrift.
That was his funeral.

“William E.” : In 1917 I was a messenger
in the N.S.W. Works Department. Twice
a clay I had to stagger out of the office
under the exhausting burden of seven or
eight letters. So
did the boys from
three other depart-
men t s, and we
used to meet on
the green patch
outside the Mit-
chell Libr a r y,
where we would
pool the missives
and re-sort them,
thus reducing the
ports of call to
three or four. The
notion of a central
rec eiv in g and
clearing depot
occurred t o me,
and, after being
rebuffed by one of
the clerks, I posted
my suggestion to
the P. S. Board.
And now I hear
that the depot is
to be established
and 100 mesenger-
bo y s retrenched.
Query: Did it take
the Postal Department four years to deliver
my letter or the Board four years to con-
sider it?
“The Dispenser”: I solemnly charge my
glass and drink to the lady doctor. Every
prescription I get from her is written so
legibly that the possibility of a mistake
on my part is remote. On the other hand
the average male leech perpetrates a hor-
rible scrawl, so much so that 20 per cent,
of his prescriptions have to be questioned
on the ’phone. There is one leading Sydney
medico whose average of unreadable scripts
is SO per cent. And when you ask him to
decipher his barbarous fist, he curses
fluently. Dr. Skirtanblouse never curses.
“Friday Island” in an elegaic mood :—•
Mention in recent Bulletins of the decadence
of Cooktown (Q.) makes one compare the luxurious
coastal steam transport of to-day with the condi-
tions under which the diggers travelled to Cooktown
45 years ago. One barque set out in 1876 with
214 optimists. There were no cabins. Only one
class. Single fare £l2, for which the passengers
were provided with transport, hammocks slung in
the foul air between decks, poor water and three
alleged meals per diem, mostly salt pork and bis-
r ts ; , The bai-que anchored every night inside the
Great B arri er Beef. Time of journey from Sydney
(about 1400 miles) was three to four weeks in
e south-east trade-wind season. Principal recrea-
tions on board were cards and fights—and booze
until it gave out. Occasionally an organised man-
W ™ occurred. Once the tank water-supply ran
low The diggers elected a rep. to guard their in-
teiests in the water ration. He failed in his trust,
kor embezzling one pint of rusty liquid he was
tiled by roll-up and sentenced to be keel-hauled
Hopes were passed over both sides of the ship, and
the culprit was dragged under the ship from port
to starboard. He is nowadays to be seen in a
luxurious car in Sydney streets, and owns a station
out west.
* * *
C. Troop”: Soon after boarding a sub-
urban tram at Cairo for a run down to the
llelouan baths, the thirsty ones of our party
were inviting the compartment—soldiers
and civilians—to “ ’Ave a swig, Dig,” from
their bottles. All willingly complied except
a well-dressed non-combatant in a corner
seat. He silently refused the repeated in-
vitations, merely shaking his fair head, and
continuing to gaze dreamily at the land-
scape. This unsociahility annoyed the chief
wassailer and prompted him to make rude
remarks about • ‘igh-class Gyppos” being too
blanky proud to drink with dinkum soldiers.
Hie silent civilian still heeded not. Then
a thought struck Bottlo. “Eli! Araf, Eng-
leesi walad?” lie demanded. “Yes,” was
the reply, “I ought to be able to speak Eng-
lish, being an Englishman and teaching Eng-
lish at the Cairo College.” Bottlo thought
it over for a few seconds. Then he re-
marked, “Well, blimey, if yer pupils use it
as often as you do, they might just as well
stick to Gyppo !”
* * * *
“Advance”: Some of the Tommy meds.
had queer ways of putting things. A Digger
in Netley Hospital developed a form of reli-
gious mania, which got on the other inmates’
nerves. Numerous applications for his trans-
ference to an Aussie depot were unnoticed,
and finally the quacks grew desperate. “Send
escort for Pte. at once,” they wired.
“H is affection is becoming contagious.”
“Bio” : What has become of the old-time
hefty, mostly-Irish navvies? Are they all
in Parliament? Several gangs that I’ve seen
lately—some of them on excavation work—
wouldn’t average 32st. On looks I’d
hack any Sydney rowing club to beat them
in a tug-of-war. In a gang of over a dozen
seen to-day not one wore bowyangs, hardly
any worked in singlets, and hobnails were
unknown: those not wearing ex-military
boots sported anything between them and
glac6-kid “romeos.” And there wasn’t a

brogue in the crowd. The Irish policeman
and publican seem to be vanishing, too.
Where have they gone?
AGAINST THE STREAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The day draws on to night,
And pulsed with purple light
A far cloud lowers;
Done, too, is my day-dreaming,
My plotting* striving, scheming,
The lights and shades that, teeming,
Filled all day’s hours.
One quest I have pursued,
From dawn to dawn renewed,
Through weeks and weeks,
As one upon a river
May row with vain endeavor,
And, beaten back, find never
The cot e he seeks.
The day dies in the west,
And yet, I know, my quest
Must onward go—
That, ’gainst the current fighting,
No hope my journey lighting,
No cove ox comfort sighting,
I still must row.
Yet, this is but the fate
Of all, though small or great,
All mortal men—
Their quest at night forsaking,
When dawn conies glowing, breaking,
They start, and, broadly waking,
Take oars again.

CASUARINA.
A DELICATE MATTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I confess that I gaze with a certain amaze
On the limbs of the flapper of Georgian days.
Such legs as are Mabel’s and Nan’s of a truth
Were on billiard tables when I was a youth.
When I was a boy—in the ’sixties or so—
All the girls of an age you could kick on the shin
(At least all the girls that I happened to know)
Were distinguished by legs most remarkably thin.
In fact, ’twas a joke in Victoria’s reign
To compare with a stork’s the lean legs of Elaine.
But now ! Well, you’ve only to look on the lawns
Where our grandmothers sported as lightly as fawns
To see —No ! I’ll stop, though I’ve uttered but half
Of the thoughts that occur on the Prodigal Calf!

“Joe Collins”: Tell “Stumpy” (B.
13/10/’2l) about this. On a farm at Batlow
(N.S.W.) a mare foaled, and a week later was re-
moved to another small paddock containing only
herself and the infant. A few days later we found
a dead foal in this paddock marked exactly like the
living one. It had been born alive, but had died
from neglect.
» * * •
“Yrrah P.”: I’ve seen birds use the same
nest for a nursery again and again, sometimes even
after being disturbed. Just out of Creswick (Vic.),
off the Clunes-road, were the ruins of an old stone-
wall shelter for animals. When I was a kid going
to school, I passed close by. On the top of a part
of this wall, about 3ft. from the ground, a couple
of magpies had their home in a slight hollow be-
tween the stones. The situation was in an open
paddock and quite unprotected. That nest was used
two years in succession, and then some wandering
Bolshevik broke up the happy home. “Jim Carew”
says his experience is that, excepting very shy
birds, all will lay in a nest that has been robbed,
provided the villa itself is not injured. In the
case of the magpies the nest was not only robbed,
but I found it lying on the ground near by. Yet
after I had put it back as well as I could, posses-
sion was soon taken and a family was reared to
maturity. And next year it was inhabited again.
That made four years in succession to my knowledge.
* * * - *
“Aragun”: “Jim Carew’s” platypus (B.
20/10/’2l) was an unmannerly cuss. The one I
caught—on shrimp-bait—bit like a turtle, and came
in like one till he struck the bank. He did some
back scratching then, and tried to take charge when
landed ; but he soon gave in.
* * * *
“Dou” : I’m in trouble. I have a sulky-
mare that, the moment you stop driving her, and par-
ticularly when she is tied up, will put her head
down, get a shaft over her neck, and force it up.
Sometimes she will stand a long time in this posi-
tion ; more often she will take her head away, let
the shaft fall, and then repeat the game. It isn’t
any good for the sulky. How can I break her of
the habit ?
“W. Asp”: At Mullewa (W.A.) is to be
found the only genuine shepherd in the country.
Each morning Cailo may be seen leading his flock of
Willies and Nannies to pasture. The dbg is usually
three or four yards ahead of his charges, and looks
to neither right nor left: he is 100 per cent, busi-
ness, and no inducement on the part of the bystander
can turn him from the straight and narrow path of
duty. In the evening back comes the warrior, with
a “something attempted, something done” expression
on his face. Next morning the goats are led to
another section of the green pastures and still waters,
and all day are guarded from the sin of eating the
other fellow’s garden. I reckon Carlo will be remem-
bered in the hereafter for all the curses that might
have been hurled at the goats if he were not there
to guide them along the path of virtue.
“Weary”: Every summer somebody asks
the best way to corn or pickle mutton. Let me get
in" early with my recipe for the very best way. Cut
the carcase into convenient sizes and boil it in the
brine—put the pieces in separate vessels, if pos-
sible —for 10 minutes. Then let it stand in the
brine, and when cool a coating of fat will be found
over the surface of the liquid. As long as the
coating of fat is riot broken the meat will keep.
When the fat has been broken, either to get a piece
out or otherwise, the brine will have to be brought
to the boil again to renew the coating.
» * * *
“Winchester”: Recently a mate and I
were out shooting. At tueker-time we placed our
guns (both loaded and at half-cock) on the ground
and tackled the lunch in our bags. I had just
settled down to work when a bullet from B—’s rifle
hit the log against which I was sitting, about three
inches away from me. My mate was a few yards
off, and, thinking he might have fired the shot acci-
dentally, I yelled out the usual compliments; but
I saw that he couldn’t have touched the rifle. Almost
as soon as I had spoken “bang” went both barrels
of my own gun, and tore the dirt for yards up
the hill. To make things more complicated neither
of the primers in either the gun or the rifle were
pierced, and the hammers were still at half-cock.
Perhaps some Abo. can explain this. It beats us.
“Jim Carew” : My dad who “followed the
diggings” tells me that to call a man “Joe” on
the Vic. rushes was the surest way of buying a
fight; and to refer to anyone in authority as “Joe”
meant a charge of offensive behavior. What hidden
insult lay under the seemingly meaningless term?
“Kingking”: Please get somebody to tell
me how to stop a horse of mine from biting me.
I have tried putting on several coats and sprinkling
a liberal coating of cayenne pepper over the sleeve
of the outer one and letting Carbine have a nip at
it. This stops him for about three days, but after
that he tries to bite a piece out of anyone who
goes near, and very often he doesn’t give anyone
time to put on even an extra pair of trousers.
“Rockdale”: Only three of our bush birds
will attack man in defence of their nest. They ,ue
the willy-wagtail, the magpie and the butcher-oiid.
I think Waggy must be given the palm for down-
right pluck in view of his size; also a bigger per-
centage of these little fellows show fight. Only
an occasional Maggy or butcher will attack but
when they do they make a job of it. The snialler
fellow is the worse, I think, because he will come
full-tilt at your face, and there’s always a possi-
bility of an eye going. The magpie comes liom

behind with an open beak, which he closes just
on impact, and can draw blood through an ordinary
felt hat. Sometimes he takes to your horse’s head,
and then he becomes really dangerous. One that
last year established his family in a tree near an
awkward bit of road alongside us (Monaro, N.S.W.)
caused two sulky smashes. We . then regretfully
ended his career. However, two of his offspring
(out of three) are now assisting us in the garden.

He would attack an elephant and give it a torrid
time, too.

“Bouragi”: The Solomon Island custom
of christening a canoe with the blood of a young
woman was particularly observed in San Christoval, the
most easterly of the group, where the most beautiful
canoes in the Pacific used to be built. The late
Douglas Rannie, one of the best-known of Queens-
land Island labor agents, told me he saw a christening
ceremony at San Christoval as late as 1907, when he
was returning repatriated Kanakas from Queensland.
The girl was a young slave, and the canoe came out
to the ship with the dripping head adorning the
high stern. The Fijian chiefs, in the days of good
King Thakambau, launched their new war canoes over
the bodies of live slaves instead of rollers.
• * * .
“Jimmy J.”: “Bad Australian” (B.
20/10/’2l) is wrong. The pheasants that have
thrived in Vic. are descendants from English birds
imported into Australia and let loose in a neighbor-
ing estate. Neither did we mistake them for lyre-
birds ; English sports who were with us during a
shooting expedition a few months back were so
elated at seeing English pheasants that they were
not content until they had bagged five of the birds.
OBVIOUSLY IMMATERIAL.
OWNER OF CAR ( exasperated ): “The engine's
missing.”
PASSENGER ( reassuringly ): “That don’t
mutter. What’s the odds so long as
nobody kin see it?”
“Menlin”: Where did “J.L.” (B.
20,/10/’2l) get the idea that the okapi was a cross
between zebra and giraffe? It is merely a near rela-
tion of the giraffe and a rare creature living in the
Congo forests (Africa). Its skin when first brought
in by the natives was thought to be that of a new
species of zebra, owing to its peculiar striping;
and the matter was not cleared up until a complete
animal was described by Johnston (of “Gay-Dom-
beys” fame). The beast is rather like a small
giraffe, with a short neck and stripes. There is no
justification for the statement that it is stronger
than its relative. Incidentally, the ancients reasoned
that the giraffe was a cross between leopard and
camel, and leopard a cross between lion and panther.
A bit more of this might greatly simplify zoology.

at Mangaia, one of the Cook group, when Maoriland
took control, punished the person guilty of incest
with a ten-dollar (Chile) fine. If a man cried after
a dead woman not his missus he was relieved of 15
dollars, on the ground that tears were a proof of
improper relations. The most serious offence in
the code was stealing a pig. That cost someone 40
dollars when an owner found himself short at the
monthly muster. Under the new Gubment the crime
of brewing “bush” beer is more heinpus than theft,
so Gubment doesn’t insist on a monthly count of
pigs. It is exhausting work, and is held to encour-
age thirst.

“J.W.1.”: After recent heavy rains in
this district (Q.) frogs of all sorts, shapes, sizes
and colors (I saw two white ones) can be seen in
droves. What becomes of them when there’s no rain
about? I’ve hunted high and low, both before and
after the rains, and can find no trace of them. An-
other point that puzzles me is how they get such a
variety of colors.

“Mindarl”: I came across a clutch of
snakes on the Nambucca River one day, and on ma
giving the password they all slid down her ’
I dislocated the lady’s headgear with a gun,
opening up her hatches I discovered 27 youn; 1

“Tom Mot”: Our cows are a wic
insanitary lot when bailed up. Can any Abo
gest a cure ?

“Zanthus” : It’s a pity S. Aus. could n
have made the whole of Kangaroo Island in\
sanctuary for fauna and flora —most of it is no
much good for anything else. But it stopped at
setting aside 200 square miles, called Flinders Chase.
This is being fenced off at the- expense of John
Lewis, M.L.C. The boundary is about the shape of a
dog’s hind-leg in places, but it might be worse.
Anyway, the island is free from foxes and rabbits,
even if there are a few poachers. The Board in
charge hopes not only to preserve the island animals,
but to introduce some of the species that are being
harried out of existence on the mainland by imported
vermin and fopls with guns and things.
“Jimmy Jamtin” : Why do kangaroos when
wounded always travel in a circle? As a member
of a ’roo drive a while back I tracked one wounded
animal for miles, and when it finally dropped it
was only a hundred or so yards from where it
received its wounds. I have not found this to be
the case with wallabies.
* * * «
“Wessel”: G. K. Gaukrodger, of Alice
Downs, near Blackall (Q.), has a photograph of
an emu’s nest with 14 eggs in it. It is a partner-
ship affair, however; two hen emus used the same
nest.

“Kitty Kitty” : A laborer while brushing
at Brimsdale, Upper Manning River (N.S.W.), came
on to a huge carpet-snake twined round 32 eggts.
About half-an-hour later his mate, close by, en-
countered one nestling a prospective family of 30.
Incidentally, the bushman rarely kills a carpet-snake,
on account of its value in assisting to keep down
the rabbits, while many enjoy an unmolested exist-
ence in barns, where they are sudden death on mice.

HOUSE AND HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My house has verandahs north and south
And gables east and west,
But I’m not as free as I wish to be,
And I like the old things best.
There’s a crimson rose beside the gate
That blooms when all roses bloom;
There’s a flaring light in the hall at night
And a glare in every room.
My home is a humpy, twelve by ten,
With a well-worn earthen floor:
The walls are rough, but it’s snug enough.
And my hat hangs on the door.
There’s an open fire, and a blazing log,
And I lounge on an easy seat,
And, half asleep, with an eye apeep,
My dog lies at my feet.
My collars are stiff when I go to church,
And my clothes are dull and black;
The coat and vest have a double breast
And they’re pleated at the back.
And the parson prays, as they mostly do,
Till someone brings the plate,
And he glides around without a sound
And the pious smirk I hate.
My neck is bare when I stay at home,
And my clothes are never tight;
I read or rest as it suits me best,
And I keep my pipe alight.
I boil the billy and make the tea,
If a mate calls for a bite,
And we tramp again, by hill and plain,
As we yarn half through the night.
THE DIPLOMAT.
“Peetoee ’ere tells me you’re going to punch
me ’ead and give me a stinker. Do you
mean it?”
“Yes. But I didn’t mean him to tell yer!”
My house has a plot of grass in front—
We speak of it as the lawn—
Where the ladies chat of this or that
While the men sit round and yawn.
The ladies gush of a hat or gown—-
Oh, lies that we all forgive;
For we do not care what the women wear,
And it’s part of the life we live!
My home has a meat-block at the front,
And a pan hangs on the wall;
There’s tins and stones and heaps of bones
Where the dog has dragged them all.
My riding saddle is on the wall
And my horse is fat and sleek ;
There is water in the petrol-tin
That I’ve carried up from the creek,
ify house has a fowl-run at the rear,
And the fowls are clean and white ;
Their strain is good, and we cook their food,
And we lock them in at night.
The rooster crows as all roosters do,
But the hens don’t often lay:
They seem to fret, and we only get
A couple of eggs a day.
The fowls at my home are running loose,
And they roost on a leaning tree;
They’re mongrel-bred and seldom fed —
There are some we seldom see.
The way they scratch is wonderful,
And I’ve never seen fowls lay more;
They do not stray when they want to lay,
And I gather an easy score.
My house has an iron railing round,
With the name above the gate:
It’s facing west where the view is best,
And it’s very up to date.
But it always feels too big for me,
Though I live there now and then;
’Twould break my heart if I had to part
With my humpy, twelve by ten.

WALTER CATHRO PTY., LTD., 50 YORK STREET, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, DISTRIBUTORS.
“Alex”: I have seen thousands of wood-
duck, but “Jaekeroo’s” white one (B. 13/10/’2l)
is the first I’ve heard of. What I have seen is a
pure white sparrow. He boarded in a Norfolk
Island pine-tree in Victoria Barracks square, Mili-
tary H.Q., Brisbane. He arrived during the first
months of the Big Fight, and shamed several “per-
manent” men into packing-up for Europe.
* # * *
“Riom”: I nominate young Jack Moir as
having been the youngest holder of a registered
horse brand, His “.T.K.M.” was on a mob of ponies
in the Gulf Country when he was six. At four he
had several horses running at picnic races.
“Echap” : Although “Bad Australian” (B.
13/10/’2l) corrects “L.J.D.” re bisected shotgun
cartridges, the latter’s method of shooting is still
possible with a modern gun —a cheap, cylinder-bore
affair —and very effective at close range; but the
dreadful inaccuracy beyond 30 or 40 yards puts it
out of bounds. I pin my faith to a modern h.v.
rifle of small calibre, shooting an expanding bullet,
which inflicts even more damage than a shot
packet, very few registered hits resulting in less
than a kill.
* * * *
“Jimsey”: There is a species of dwarf
pine which grows on the slopes of Mount Pring
(Q.), and rarely reaches a height of more than 3ft.
I know of two specimens which were transplanted 23
years ago. One of them is now 2ft. 7in. high, and
has not grown at all during the last three years.
The other beats it by inches.
“Zanthus” : Sir Thomas Mitchell was more
than an explorer: he was also a pioneer in the
study of Australian birds. The Sydney Herald of
April 18, 1831, said:—
A neat aviary is building by the Surveyor-General,
Major Mitchell, at his new residence on the AVool-
loomooloo Hill for the purpose of domesticating a
number of Australian birds. This is the first erec-
tion of its kind in the colony.
So it’s only a fair thing that “Major Mitchell’s
cockatoo’’ should be named after the old ornitholo-
gist.
* * * *
“Warradulla”: On the Wangat River (N.
Coast, N.S.W.), about a mile above where the
Chicester Weir is being built, there is a swampy
flat known as Leeches Hollow. One night Jim
Bronte, a' prospector and a stranger to the district,
camped there. Apparently, having spread out his
swag, he just divested himself of his coat and boots,
threw himself down and fell asleep. Late the fol-
lowing day Harvey, a cow-cockv, was looking for
some strayed poddies, when he struck the spot and
found Bronte lying dead, with a queer little sickly
smile petrified on his countenance. His cheeks,
neck, bare arms and feet were perforated with in-
numerable blood-stained holes. A few leeches still
clung to him, and many others well-gorged and
drowsy lolled in the grass. The prospector might
have died from heart-failure, but I plump for
murder by leech-era ft.
“Ess”: Some very old men go on the road
with sheep. I saw one who could only potter along
at the tail with a walking-stick, and wasn’t worth
his salt as a worker. But he got £3 a week and
his keep, and could get a job with sheep where
younger mgn couldn’t. He had an intelligent little
animal that was worth two men at the side, and was
easily directed by hand signals. That dog was
the old man’s sole support.
THAT AFTER-DINNER FEELING.
MRS. HANDOUT: “I s’pose now that I’ve
given you a good feed you feel equal
to doin’ a bit of work for me?”
THE FEEDER: “Madam, I’m more than equal
to it. I’m sooperior to it.”
“M. 21”: “Aragun,” “8.N.J.,” “Delhi”
and others can have their several ways of trying to
prevent their moke from breaking the bridle, but
I’ll stick to my own. First, place a good strong
headstall on him, one with a ring on the chin-
piece ; a strong nose-band is essential, as if he
CABBY GETS A TIP.
DRUNK: “I say (hie), cabby, are you (hie) engaged?”
Cabby (very politely): “No, sir.”
DRUNK: “Very well (hie) —clean your harness.”
breaks it or gets away all the trouble is wasted
and he will be harder to correct. Next, get a
good strong rope with a noose in it, and fix this
loosely around his flank, with the eye of the noose
underneath, so that it will slacken off as soon us
he stops pulling ; run the other end of the rope
up between his front legs and through the ring in
the headstall, and tie to a strong post. Leave
about 3ft. of rope from his nose to the post, so
that he can’t get his front feet over it. Make him
fight it until he gives in, and I guarantee he won’t
break any more bridles.
“Centurion”: Tell “Bad Australian” (B.
13/10/’2l) that the wire cartridge is not confined
to the “old smooth-bore muzzle-loader.” Breech-
loading cartridges are still made up with a wire
cylinder holding the shot. Though useful in a
cheap gun where the bad boring of the barrels leads
to a spreading of the shot soon after leaving the
muzzle, the wire is no help to a good hand-finished
gun. In any brand of weapon it plays merry hades
with the barrels.
* * * *
“Cambronne” : “De Oriel” (B. 13/10/’2l)
says that “a man in Leith (Tas.)
set a barnyard hen upon some quail
eggs, but the birds ran for their life
when they saw their mother, and
haven’t been sighted since.” Now,
lest it should be assumed that all
quail chicks hatched under a hen bolt
for their lives when they see their
foster-mother, I will tell a story. A
woman at Winnaleah (Tas.) —I have
the honor to be her husband —set a
barnyard hen upon 22 quail eggs, the
product of two deserted nests. Re-
sult, 22 quail chicks, all of which the
old hen reared until they were able
to fly, when the ungrateful little beg-
gars basely deserted her. I don't
think the good old chookey would
have ever deserted them, she was
so proud of ’em. She would gather
the whole family under her, with,
perhaps, one or two perched on her
back. If anyone went into the
orchard where they were, the chicks
usually bolted for the long grass,
but would come out when the old
hen called them. Perhaps the rea-
son these chicks didn’t bolt when
they were hatched was that the
hatching was done in a box with
sides too high to jump over, or per-
haps it was because a woman set
'em. What does a man know about
setting eggs, anyhow ?
«■ •» *
“Invalid”: “Midgehope” says (B.
6/10/’2l) that the codfish digests the flesh of the
mussel, and that the shell is returned through the
mouth. Well, I have cleaned a codfish which con-
tained a mussel whose shell had been partly digested.
The mussel itself was alive, and as well as Jonah
was in a similar predicament.
“Alex.”: “T.0.P.” (B. 13/10/’2l) asks
how to make tank-water drinkable after ’possums
have suicided in it. Right-o! Empty in 10 gallons
of rum to every 30 gallons of fluid in the tank.
The water will then taste like as if your foot’s
asleep.
“Nod Kelly”: “Stumpy’s” cow (B.
13/10/’2l), which calved on Thursday and gave
birth to another calf the following Tuesday, reminds
me of a four-year-old Jersey on the N. S. Wales
South Coast, which a few years ago gave birth to
twin calves, both heifers, and exactly five weeks
later produced another pair of heifers.
“Rang”: At Beauchamp, in the Mallee.
25 miles from Kerang (Vic.), I recently saw a
blue wren. He was a male and completely blue,
except for a little grey patch at the back of his
head. Can anyone place him ?
“H.V.E.”: Re the lead-colored serpent
(B. 18/8/’2l and 8/9 / ’ 21) supposed to be
the grey whip-snake, but which, I think,
hadn’t the distinguishing yellow mark-
on the nape of the neck. This is,
I now believe, the lead-colored snake
< Nlegonotus plumbeus), of which,
according to AVaite, there are two
fornv. One found on the Herbert
River (Q.) measured about 4ft. This
snake is solid-toothed, harmless and
very little known. The first one I
saw was near the mineral spring at
Cambalong station, Monaco (N.S.AV.),
on a bluff covered with volcanic
stones ; the second was near the Black
Lake on Burmina station, in the same
quarter. This species is certainly
rare, as are many other Australian
snakes, also described from single
examples only, while the range of
many of them, both venomous and
solid-toothed (or harmless), is exceed-
ingly wide. By the way, it is strange
that the brown tree-snake (Dips ado-
morphus fuscus), though it has
grooved or “specialised” fangs, is
accounted harmless, the venom glands apparently
being absent in this species. Ages ago it may
have been a skilled poisoner.
“Claude”; “Mud” (B. 13/10/’2l) notes
the case of a male cat wet-nurse. The phenomenon
is not limited to cats. Haeckel records several
cases in human beings. Of the mammary gland he
says: “In the male sex it is small and inactive, a
real rudimentary organ of no physiological interest.
Nevertheless, in certain cases we find the breast as
fully developed in man as in woman, and it may
give milk for feeding the young.” Also: “Another
case has been described by Alexander von Humboldt.
In a South American forest he found a solitary
settler whose wife had died in child-birth. The
man had laid the new-born child on his own breast
in despair; and the continuous stimulus of the
child’s sucking movements had revived the activity
of the mammary glands. It is possible that ner-
vous suggestion had some share in it. Similar
cases have been often observed in recent years,
even among other male mammals, such as sheep
and goats.” In explanation, he says: “The great
scientific interest of these facts is in their bearing
on the question of heredity. As in the lower and
older mammals (the monotremes and most of the
marsupials), the whole lactiferous apparatus is only
found in the female, and as there are traces of
it in the male only in a few younger marsupials,
there can be no doubt that these important organs
"ere originally found only in the female mammal,
and that they were acquired by these through a
special adaptation to habits of life. Later, these
female organs were communicated to both sexes
by heredity; and they have been maintained in all
persons of either sex, although they are not phvsio-
logically active in the males. This normal perma-
nence of the female lactiferous organ in both sexes
of the higher mammals and man is independent of
any selection, and is a fine instance of the much-
disputed ‘inheritance of acquired characters.’ ”
“Bouragi”: Though I never saw Aus-
tralian abos. playing “cat’s cradle,” I believe they
do play it, and 1 have seen it being done by Papuans,
Pacific Islanders generally, Zulus and other brands of
Kaffir, East Indians, .Malays, Javanese and Chows.
The Papuan kiddies especially excel in the intricate
tricks, and one wonders how on earth such an
elaborate game has found its way to all corners of
the civilised and uncivilised earth. It was certainly
not introduced to the Papuans by the European.
“R.S.”: Re Binghi’s ability to count. On
the Hermansburg run, between Alice Springs and
Oodnadatta (S.A.), the Rev. C. 11. Strehlou teaches
about 60 children, between seven and 14 years of
age. They are apt at geography, writing, singing
and poetry, but as regards mathematics they are
almost hopeless. The Arunta tribe, to which they
belong, has no number-words and no clear idea of
number beyond two.

“Silas Snell” : “AYe was huntin’ coal-seams
in the hills apast Morwell there,” said Ole Joe, “and
I had me own little six-be-eight perched on the
side of the hill, about 30 yards from the others.
We was not expectin’ to be stayin’ long, and I
hadn’t bin to much trouble peggin’ her down. It
was early in the Sunday evenin’, the other lads was
down at Lefter’s farm, a coupla miles away, when of

“J.A.H.”: Talking about Brother Binghi’s
acquaintance with figures, this happened at Charle-
ville (W.Q.). Chelmsford, then his Excellency,
was coming, and it had been arranged that he was
to visit the local school. In honor of the occasion
the flag was to be dipped while the pupils gave him
a welcome. Unfortunately, during rehearsal the day
before, the halyard snapped, and the knotted end
ran up to the pulley, some 40 J 'eet. It was a des-
perate situation, and all appeared lost until the
schoolmaster thought of Charley, the black-tracker.
Seeking him out, the pedagogue explained matters
and was promised the abo.’s assistance. Charley
duly turned up next morning and was shown the

mess. Gazing up at the pole he scratcned his nut
and remarked, “By golly, boss, him high!” “Not
too high for you, Charley,” said the schoolmaster;
“how high you think ?” “Oh, ’bout six feet, boss.”
“Well, you try, Charley,” and half-a-crown was
temptingly displayed. The abo. gazed aloft again,
did some hard thinking, and then decided to tackle
the job. Shinning up the stick, he got the offending
rope and brought it down; then, taking another
squint skywards, he said: “By cripes, boss, him
more’n six feet! Mine bin tinkit him seven feet!”

Ball Bearings are self-aligning and instantly adjust themselves to shaft
deflection, speing, or load change. Equipped with SSCF" Ball Bearings
you get more power out of the same plant than you could if plain bearings
or roller bearings were utilised—not to mention saving of oil, time, wages,
upkeep and increased life of bearings and belts.

The “Home-made” Craze
WORK finished? That’s splendid.
Well, I’m afraid you ladies will
have to be idle for a little until
a fresh lot of files are ready: this comes of
‘hustling’!”
And the door closed behind the back of
the head of Department X. The four occu-
pants of the room settled themselves a trifle
more easily in their chairs. One, a slim,
red-haired girl, whipped a piece of lemon-
colored knitting from a drawer and bent dili-
gently to her needles.
“That going to be a jumper, Miss May-
field?” inquired a dark girl whose hair
tumbled untidily about her ears. Then, as
the other nodded, “you are clever: there’s
a regular craze for home-made things, but
I’m such an awful slacker. Oh, bother
my hair!” she broke off, vainly trying to
thrust back an unruly lock, “I washed it
last night, and I can’t do a thing with it
to-day.”
“What do you wash it with?” inquir■ c
Miss Mayfield. “Not Stallax, I’m sure
Ah, I thought not.”
“I do,” said a pretty fair girl who h
not yet spoken. “It’s simply splent
stuff.”
“There,” said Miss Mayfield, “I told you
so. You try it next time. If you haven’t
any at home a chemist will always supply
it. It works up into the most lovely foamy
lather and cleans your hair in no time.
Afterwards it dries quickly and crisply, so
that it can be done up at once—none of
that untidy ‘endy’ look the day after a
shampoo.”
“Well, well,” said the dark-haired one,
“that’s something worth trying. As we’re
on the subject, do any of you know a cure
for falling hair? I’m convinced I'm getting
prematurely bald; also I’ve got quite a
little patch of grey hair—overwork, of
course,” she grinned.
The head of the room, a slightly older
woman whose face was redeemed from plain-
ness by the masses of soft brown, hair sur-
rounding it, sailed into the discussion.
“I don’t think you’ll beat my recipe, Miss
Carey,” she said; “and, like Miss May-
field’s jumper, it’s home made. Get a pack-
age of boranium from your chemist, and
dissolve it ift bay rum. If you rub this
into the roots of your hair at night y
find, in a few days, that not only wi i
hair stop falling out, but it will grov mi<..
more thick and glossy. If you aren’t ing
about that grey hair I can give you a tip
which has been of great use to me person-
ally.”
“I’d be fearfully grateful, Mrs. Drewe,"
answered Miss Carey.
“Well,” said the other, “it is not unlike
the first recipe, only this time the bay rum
should have pure tammalite dissolved in it.
You should apply the mixture with a clean,
small brush, and it will gradually restore
the faded part to its normal color. Of
course, this isn’t a dye; I know nothing
about hair-dyes, for I disapprove of them
entirely. But it’s a wonderful tonic.”
“Thanks so much,” Miss Carey said; “I
ought to be a dream of beauty as regards
my hair. Seriously, though, I’m going to
try your ideas. Stallax, boranium, tamma-
lite—is that right? Thanks, Miss May-
field, what a delicious jumper that is;
but my complexion would never stand that
color. You red-haired girls are lucky, you
always have such topping skins.”
“I had anything but a topping skin a
year ago,” replied the latter. I used to
freckle and burn and get dreadfully blotched-
looking. Then a friend told me that mer-
colised wax was by far the most scientific
and effective thing she knew. If it is rubbed
on at night and washed off with warm water
in the morning it gradually absorbs the outer
skin which has become stained and rough-
ened, and reveals the fresh new skin under-
neath. It sounded rather wonderful, and
so I tried it; and I’ve used no other face-
cream since.”
“Would you believe it?” murmured the
facetious Miss Carey. “I wouldn’t be half
so bad-looking if I had Jmur skin, Miss May-
field. Is this was very difficult to get?”
“Not a bit,” said the other; “any decent
chemist has some in stock.”
Mrs. Drewe looked up. “You all seem
great beauty-specialists! I wonder if one of
you experts know if there is any way of
curing blackheads, as I have a friend who is
quite disfigured with them?”
Miss Carey knitted her brows, but the
fair girl said quickly: “I think most people
use something called stymol, which you can
buy in tablet form. It closes the pores of
the skin, or, rather, reduces them to their
proper size, and that loosens any blackheads
and prevents others from forming.”
“How do you use it?” inquired Mrs. Drewe.
“For blackheads, I believe you dissolve a
tablet in warm water, bathe them and gently
remove them with a towel. But, though-I
don’t personally suffer from blackheads I
often have a stymol face-bath. It’s so de-
liciously sparkling and refreshing.”
“Thank you so much; I am sure my friend
will be very grateful,” smiled Mrs. Drewe.
A step sounded in the corridor. “I’m
afraid this very enlightening discussion must
be postponed,” she continued. “I think that’s
the messenger with our files. Yes, here
they come. We must carry on with the
work now.” — Advt.

sufferings most acute, every branch of the force—

quick grasp and his sympathy in their enterprises

from first to last he exchanged no courtesies with
his enemy although the Empire was applauding the
German captain’s chivalry. Bridges wrote to Sena-

America’s Literary Drama
When all has been said in praise or dis-
favor of the most workmanlike productions
in American stage-plays, the fact remains
that thus far there are no stage classics
native to the birthland of the “crook and
- 1 hone dr mu Three volumes of Rcpre-
' 1 ir - I’iay by American Dramatists,
edited and introduced bv Montrose J. Moses
iDutton and Co., New York), deal with the
subject from 17ti5 to 1911, the last volume
covering- the ground from 1856, a period of
• x > yt-aiS in all. An old theatregoer, start-
r 1 these representative examples of
Lest. in the work of American drama-
tists still living in the flesh or in reputation,
is almost shocked to discover that three of
them—“ The Easiest Way,” “In Mizzoura”
and "Rip Van. Winkle” —have been ade-
quately played in this country without add-
ing aught to its literary education. True,
“In Mizzoura,” staged here by Nat
Goodwin, its original hero and producer,
influenced ' the construction of “On Our
Selection” 15 years later. But is literature
indebted to the comic romance of exaggerated
rural life which actors Bailey and Duggan
melodramatised from Steele Rudd’s story?
“In Mizzoura,” by Augustus Thomas, was
a domestic drama of American “Western”
life, obtrusively untheatrical in its day.
The action revolved around a kitchen dining-
room, and centred in the local sheriff, who
was kind and virtuous —a sheriff who, when
the villain suggests that he should kill a
dog to put it out of its lameness, answers
with a long sing-song drawl, and “an appeal-
ing look to the others” (stage instructions),
‘V hy, I never killed a man!” Cheap
bathos can no further go than in that stereo-
typed .American Western expression of a
humanity which would rather slay a human
than hurt a dog. There was nothing in “In
Mizzoura” to remember save its ostentatious
simplicity of realism as compared with the
rugged artificiality of conventional mining
melodramas, like Bartley Campbell’s “My
Partner,” commended to Australia by the
powerful acting of George Rignold. Its
inclusion in a selection of representative
American plays helps to proclaim the
poverty in stage literature of a land truly
rich in magazine fiction and picturesque
journalism.
“Intellectual” or “problem” drama ap-
peared at its American b&st, so this editor
thinks, in Eugene Walter’s “The Easiest
u ay,” written in 1908 and staged in Aus-
tralia four or five years ago. Mr. Moses
accepts it as “one of the most direct pieces
of work the American stage had thus far
Produced.... not as literary a piece in dra-
matic expression as Pinero’s ‘lris,’ but better
in effect; because its relentlessness is due,
not so predominantly to the moral down-
grade of the woman, as to the moral down-
grade of a certain phase of life which en-
gulfs those nearest.” Now, this country
found the taste of “The Easiest Way” nas-
tier in its mouth than that of other plays
wherein Muriel Starr impersonated a tem-
pestuous heroine, not because it dealt only
with sordid types of sophisticated city life,
and was fairly accurate in its drawing of
the types, and utterly disdainful
of ‘ moral uplift” in its purpose, but on
account of the plot, being falsified for the
purpose of enhancing the vicious effect.
JS one of the chief incidents in a play of
admittedly forcible characters and clever
dialogue are quite convincing, save the
visits to Laura of a cunning chorus
syren who is feathering her nest from the
plumage of an ancient goose. The incident
ot letter, for instance—the letter which
Laura s recapturer compelled her to write,
but did not take to the post himself. Left
alone with the epistle she was bound to
destroy it; yet the far-seeing cynic, know-
ing his little Laura from A to Z, failed to
foresee that. And why drag the name of Pinero
into a eulogy of “The Easiest Way”? In
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” no situation
smacks of improbability. In the “most
direct work the American stage has thus far
produced” none of the emotional crises come
about in a perfectly reasonable way.
The second work in the bulky volume is
“Francesca da Rimini,” by George Henry
Boker, born a century ago and dead these
30 years. Boker, a wealthy American diplo-
mat in later life, had genuine literary pre-
tensions, and good, sound dramatic sense.
Something of a poet in the first place, he
was a very young man when his tragedy
“Calaynos” was staged by Samuel Phelps,
the actor who kept poetic drama alive at a
London suburban theatre for a dozen con-
secutive years. There must have been good
stuff in the unknown author’s play, or
Phelps would not have bothered with it.
“Francesca da Rimini” came to light in
1553, one of many dramatisations of Dante’s
story. Not a great work of brilliant accom-
plishment in blank verse—not as poetic in
thought as W. 11. Wills, a prolific adapter
of classics for the English stage in the 60’s
and ’7o’s, could have written—but good
enough to hold an American reputa-
tion to this day, despite crude lines and the
incongruous character of its serio-comic
relief.
And what of Bronson Howard’s “Shen-
andoah,” a melodrama of the American Civil
War, staged in 1888? “One can hardly
say that, either for the theatre or the
library, Bronson Howard is a permanent
factor,” says editor Moses. Let us hope not.
The incident of a son imposing himself upon
his father as a gallant stranger is the back-
bone of the “Shenandoah” plot; for the rest
of the story it is conventional military melo-
drama, banal in much of the dialogue and
sugared with a little of the soft sentimen-
talism which American audiences thus far
demand alike of hustling comedy and
appealing tales of criminality. Bronson
Howard knew his business. His “Young
Mrs. Winthrop” might perhaps be counted
in the same class as, say, “Dr. Wake’s
Patient,” and his semi-farcical comedy of
“Saratoga,” with its title changed to “Brigh-
ton,” gave the late Sir Charles Wyndham
his first good opportunity to make a hit in
London.
Easily the brightest representative play
in this collection is “The New York Idea,”
by Langd'on Mitchell, born 60 years ago.
It reads well. All the humor turns on the
facilities of American divorce law, and
Bernard Shaw, not to mention other notable
repertory dramatists, could have been more
bitingly humorous in his treatment of the
same easy subject. Nevertheless the direct
truth of Langdon Mitchell’s genial satire
has a kindliness quite foreign to Shaw, his
model. Broadly speaking, one may say that
of the modern plays in Mr. Moses’s collec-
tion. only “The New York Idea” and “The
Easiest Way” have full literary pretensions.
“The Return of Peter Grimm” is taken
as a striking example of the art of David
Belasco, author of “The Darling of the
Gods,” “Madame Butterfly,” “The Girl of
the Golden West,” etc. But “Peter Grimm”
is a play with a fad, sombre in . tone and
marked by a mawkish che-ild interest that
forbids critical admiration for the work,
apart from its unwholesome moral. The
fondness of Belasco for new ingenuities in
stage effect, and his blindness to the border-
line between the sublime and the silly are
in a great measure revealed in a play that,
apart from its mechanical aids, might .have
been better designed and written by that
earnest brother-spiritualist, Conan Doyle.
There is a certain “softness,” a “flabbi-
ness” in the national character of America’s
refined social circles, utterly at variance
with the dollar-worship that prevails in
town . life. You get it in “Daddies,”
and in the very title of such sweet,
ladylike heroes as “Daddy Long Legs”
and “The Cinderella Man.” You get it in
Clyde Fitch’s New York society play, “The
Moth and the Flame.” Yet Clyde Fitch,
an undoubtedly clever craftsman, is said by
Mr, Moses to have “brought a vivacity to
the American stage that no other American
playwright has succeeded in emulating.” He
is likened to Pinero, whereas this represen-
tative sample of his literary quality gives
him no apparent claim to favorable com-
parison with Henry Arthur Jones, author
of “The Liars.” It is in impressive utter-
ances of worldly* wisdom, in dialogue that
creates interest in dominating characters
and gives them an atmosphere of truth, that
America’s best society comedies are want-
ing. No character in this volume of plays
has the distinction of the Duke of St.
Olpherts in “The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith,”
the shrewd young lady amanuensis in “The
Tyranny 0 f Tears,” Lord Petworth in Syd-
ney Grundy’s “Sowing the Wind,” discreet
Cayley Drummle in “Tanqueray” or the
philosophical moralist in “The Liars,” to
quote only from British plays in American
language. Nor does one find any line of
advice as pungent as that given to the
Cabinet Minister by hi.s father in Jones’s
“The Bauble Shop”: “Remember, my boy,
that it isn’t immorality which ruins a public
man ; but some d—d thing or another which
all of us do, and only one man gets found
out in.”
The volume is disappointing. With the
exception of “The New York Idea” no play
tempts one to a second reading of it.

The Inky Way
“W.E.M.”: Word of another novel by Mrs. Horace
Tremlett recalls the “roaring- days” of the ’nineties
in Westralia, when Horace Tremlett, who came from
South Africa, managed a mine in the Kanowna dis-
trict, and his wife seemed to enjoy the rough experi-
ence. But she hasn’t “written up” the Westralia
she knew, and perhaps it is a merciful thing.
“Machete”: “D.E.” (B. 27/10/’2l) supports
the contention of the writer of “Limehouse Nights”
that a man can be killed by a prick of a pin
dipped in aconitine, and quotes the case of Dr.
Lamson. But when all hope of a reprieve was
gone Lamson told Monty Williams, his advocate,
that what he had reallv done was to poison a
raisin in a cake and see that the unfortunate urchin
got the loaded slice.
“Vox”: As the war recedes the In Memoriam
columns in the morning papers shrink to their
normal dimensions. A few fond souls still versify
their sorrow, after a fashion, when the Day comes
round, but the majority have dropped out. From
the literary point of view their disappearance is
welcome. Consider the desperate triteness of
“In our hearts your memory lingers,
Sweetly tender, fond and true.
And there’s not a day, dear William,
That we do not think of you.”
And of—
“lt’s only a mother who knows the sorrow,
It’s only a mother who knows the pain
Of losing the boy she loved so dearly,
But hopes in Heaven to meet again.”
Quite 75 per cent, of the mourners who drop into
“poetry” ring the changes on dreadful lines like these.
\it even obituary verse, paid for at so much an
inch, can be simple and dignified. I lifted the sub-
joined couplet from an English paper; the subject
was a young lieutenant, an only son, who fell on
the Somme:—
“You were our pride. We dreamed such things for you.
God intervened—and so the dream came true.”
Can any Bulletin reader match it with a quotation
from an Australian paper?
“W.E.M.”: Away back in the ’eighties the Rev.
George Henry Somerset Walpole, now Bishop of
Edinburgh, wgs Rector of St. Mary’s, Auckland. It
was always realised that a brilliant future lay before
him, but probably no one imagined that his little
son, at that time playing marbles, would some day
be famous. I have read a good many of Hugh Wal-
pole’s novels, but it was only the other day that I
came across “Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill,” published
in 1911. It is a story of school-life, school-masters
and to some extent of school-boys. It is an aston-
ishing fact that “the dullest, fattest and heaviest
boy (a youngster with spectacles and a protruding
chin)” in this story (page 105) is “Somerset Wal-
pole.” Is there any other instance on record of such
a tribute paid by a Action-writer to his father?
“J.F.H.” (London) : The numerous collections of
Australian MSS. stored in the British Museum are
scattered about under all sorts of headings and
spread all over 40 or 50 different departments, so
that very few have any idea of the wealth of his-
torical information they contain. So far as Ameri-
can MSS. are concerned, the Americans took the
work of cataloguing and classifying in hand some
years ago. When is Australia going to follow ruifc?
Attention was called latelf to the fact that the
correspondence of Sir Joseph Banks is preserved in
the Botanical Department of the Museum. It is
bound in 17 folio volumes, and is not nearly as
well known as it deserves to be. Another large and
interesting correspondence dealing with early Aus-
tralia and preserved in the Museum is that of Jorge
Jorgenson, the Danish adventurer who made himself
King of Iceland for a brief and bustling period, arid
who was subsequently transported to Tasmania. But
this manuscript curiosity is better known to Austra-
lians, as (if I may be allowed to say so) I em-
bodied extracts from it in my old-time book, “The
Comical King.” Still, there is a good deal of in-
teresting and informative material in it which I
diil not use and which remains unpublished—-notably
Jorgenson’s first-hand narratives of his voyages around
the Australian coasts with Vancouver, Flinders and
other early navigators.
“Jacaranda”: When the University of Queensland
set out to supply a course for the Diploma of Jour-
nalism it fell into trouble. Lured by the nominees
of the Labor Government on the senate, regulations
were framed whereby students wishing to undertake
the course were required to apply to the Queensland
district of the A.J.A. for a certificate that such stu-
dents had served at least three years in practical
journalism. The A.J.A. executive quite naturally
refused to grant these certificates to applicants who
were not members. So a new statute provides that
“the senate may in its discretion admit as a candi-
date any person of good fame and character (a)
who is a matriculated student of the Faculty of
Arts, or (b) who has had at least three years’ prac-
tical experience of journalism and produces evidence
thereof satisfactory to the senate.” The course
extends over at least two academic years, and the
study includes English, British history, economics,
constitutional history and political science and edu-
cation. Early this year the course was commenced,
and about a dozen journalists were enrolled; and
though they find it a heavy job to study and do
their ordinary work, next year there will be a
number of fresh faces in front of the professors.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos John Lang’s “Botanv Bay”
(B. 6/10/’2l). The “N. S. Wales Bookstall Co., sole
proprietor Henry Lloyd,” published a reprint (no
date); the original was published by Ward, Lock
and Co., in London. Lang, in his preface, says that
most of the stories had appeared in Household
Words, and the remainder in the Welcome Guest;
and that all are founded on fact but with names,
dates and localities altered. There is, incidentally,
a quaint confession of youthful impetuosity in that
preface: “I would here desire to express that it
afforded me great joy to find that the prophecy in
which I indulged at a public meeting at Sydney
College, in 1842, when I inconsistently seconded
Mr. W. C. Wentworth’s resolution, that the Crown
be petitioned to grant (lie colony a representative
Assembly, was not fulfilled but falsified. 1 was a
very young (and perhaps a silly and selfish) man
when 1 propounded in public that the Colony was
not ripe for any government, save that of a pip'ely
Crown Government; and the severe handling I re-
ceived from the entire press of the Colony was no
doubt well merited.” Lang wrote another Botany
Bay book, “The Forger’s Wife,” and some others,
notably “Too Clever by Half.” His history, by
the way, is shrouded in mystery. He was a bar-
rister-at-law, and spent some time in India, but we
don’t know what practice he had.
“Moo”: In the last few months I have come across
half-a-dozen stories in American magazines by Yankee
writers in which Australian characters have ap-
peared, and in each one the Australian was a villain,
for whom no crime 1 was too desperate or too con-
temptible. Judging by contemporary American fic-
tion the average writing Yank’s idea of the Aus-
tralian is a person who goes about cutting throats,
robbing houses and talking in a language like nothing
on earth. One such character, “Anzac Pete,” is a
“cold-blooded brute, atavistically impelled to brutal
degenerate impulses,” and the talented writer makes
him say “Yus, I-li’ni er Hossie, Hi ham, gorblime,
but Ili’m livin’ hin Hamerica riaow fer keeps. Good
ole Hamerica an’ ter ’ell wiv Ilostralia, Hi ses.”
And Australia goes on admitting Yankee magazines
and novels at what is little more than a nominal
duty. It s like supplying stationery and stamps to
a person who persists in sending you offensive letters.
Cooceville, by Allen Gilfillan (Melrose). Nomi-
nally, a novel; really, a collection of descriptive and
character sketches drawn in a Vic. Mallee town-
ship with a heavy hand. Now and then, as in the
account of a bush-fire, there is some powerful writ-
ing, but these springs in a desert of detail and
wooden caricature are few and far between. A
competent sub-editor might have made something of
the thing by shortening the sentences, correcting
the punctuation and eliminating at least 100 pages
(11 are devoted to the lugubrious lines of a very
minor poet, self-destroyed—much too late —in the
last chapter), but lacking this drastic treatment it
is a book ruined by redundances and irrelevancies.
And it is badly printed on poor paper.
JAMBED!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
He jambs his lines. What though the verse enshrines
A dream of joy to shame the Philistines,
And visions of delight, the Editor
Raises the roof in wrath and smites the floor
And this pure gem of loveliness declines.
What cares he how the moon of beauty shines,
Or why the Bard has strayed among the pines!
“Typewriter’s cramp!” he mutters—“nothing more!”
In vain the Poet every phrase refines,
And Keats’s charm with Milton’s force combines.
Wild, fevered words throughout the oflice roar—
“ The same old tripe, less’toothsome than before!”
He jambs his lines! (Pause here.) He damns his
lines.

“Magnum”: Cab-drivers in France are the
most energetic in the world. I once saw
two fight with knives at Antibes, in the
south, over which of them should drive a
solitary female patron. Passers-by helped
with advice, one cocker went to hospital
with a knife wound in his ribs, the other to
prison for three months, the female patron
fainted, and the neddies of the two warriors
bolted.
* * * *
“The Wanderer” : Curious how we pro-
gress sideways, crab-fashion. Wingham, on
the Manning (N.S.W.), is rejoicing in a
weekly supply of trawled fish from Sydney.
It’s really not sending coals to Newcastle,
because the Manning fishermen (mostly
Dagoes) ship their “produce” to Sydney, just
as the oystermen do their oysters. Thus a
Manning River oyster is a luxury in Wing-
ham, and a Manning River fish isn’t much
different. #
“Ragar” : If the Scotch canning company
gets to work on the North Westralia turtle
in the fashion mentioned by “R. Trant” (B.
25/8/’2l) it won’t leave much turtle for the
next comer. Fully 70 per cent, of the eggs
hatched fail to reach maturity, the young
turtles being gobbled up by gulls and rats
during the race from the top of the beach,
and by crayfish and rock-cod as soon as they
enter the water. Those that reach their
full size are preyed on by the natives, by
whom the flesh of the turtle is considered
an essential part of every big feast. The
canning co. is said to need 2000 turtle before
it starts, and then will require a supply of
500 per week—in other words, 26,000 per
year. The turtle is a real trier in the way
of multiplying, but against that drain he
will soon become as rare as the dugong,
which was just as plentiful once.
“Murkah”: I agree with “Variometer”
(B. 27/10/’2O) that Australia hasn’t a
radio-station capable of kicking even a dot
as far as Cairo. But mere increase of power
wouldn’t solve the difficulty. Australian
wireless stations all use the obsolete spark,
and 200 k.w. is the most power that can
usefully be applied to any spark system.
At Clifden, Ireland, and at Cape Cod, 200
k.w. makes a very poor job of bridging the
Atlantic, a mere 2000 miles. From Perth
or Broome to Cairo is more than twice that
far. What is really needed is the introduc-
tion of one of the efficient continuous-wave
systems. . Cairo, Port Said and Hong Kong,
with 30 k.w., are less powerful than Sydney
and Perth (35 k.w.), yet, because of their
splendid continuous-wave transmitters, they
are audible all over Australia, while Sydney
and Perth require good conditions to throw
a signal 1000 miles.
“ Jackeroo”: Recent experiments at Dal-
mally (Q.) have demonstrated that there
is nothing like arsenic for the maggot-fly.
In a soluble form it can be used with safety
on sheep, young and old, shorn and woolly.
The strength has been increased from 0.6
to 1 per cent., and the greater the strength
the greater the efficiency. At 1 per cent,
it kills all maggots within six hours. As
soon as it is jetted on the sheep, the mag-
gots get uneasy and restless: those that can
do a break drop off, the others motion for
the undertaker. The sheep then has rest,
can feed and soon recovers. The only diffi-
culty thus far is to fix the arsenic in the
wool, and so retain immunity from further
infestations, although these are slight as a
rule if the jetting is properly done. W. A.
Russell, of Dalmally station, and W. G.
Brown, the Government sheep and wool
expert, are mentioned in despatches for their
efforts to knock out Australia’s worst insect
pest.
* * * *
“Dido”: A new spiel appeared on the
Saturday preceding the Derby in Melbourne.
In one case the rook had tracked his victim,
a somewhat inflated winner, getting away
with his load before the last race, and con-
trived to occupy the same seat in the rail-
way carriage. Then he inquired with some
little excitement of later comers what had
won the last, the Dundonald Welter. Green
Malt, he was told. At that he used a pic-
turesque oath, and producing a betting
ticket said: “There’s a bit of rotten luck!
I backed it 20 to five some days ago, and I
can’t stay to collect.” He made the affluent
backer at his elbow his confidant. He had
received a telegram on the course calling
him home to Sydney on important business.
“I can’t stay to collect,” he said ruefully.
“I’ll have to take 14 or 15 for it from the
owner of the pub where I am staying.”
Here the quarry bit. He would give 16
for it. The holder seemed reluctant, but
finally consented, and took the £l6. When
the new holder presented the ticket to the
bookie at the club that night he got no
money, and narrowly escaped being booted.
The ticket was a fake, of course.
THE GAMBLERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Farming is always more or less a gamble in
Australia.” —Daily paper.
The mastery of sod and drill is royal,
When generations of one house and name
Have yielded to the years a service loyal,
Nor sought nor asked for fame,
Save the applause of green and growing things
That mark the triumph of a hillside’s kings.
But here the wealth of the great sun is wasted
And men neglect the splendor of the rain.
The dream-fruit of the land is still untasted,
The good soil calls in vain ;
For there are places built of brick and stone
Where the worn dice of life are faster thrown.
The gamble of the land turns on the season;
Not every year the willing toilers win.
This is the obvious and fateful reason
Why for a brown coin’s spin
Men leave the bush and cluster in the street,
And give their children bitter husks to eat.
The wind and sun still gamble—more’s the pity—
But these at least will play an honest game.
The double-headed penny of the city
Is swift and sure as shame.
Who that has seen Spring’s cards would raise the
question
Between the land and that base rogue, Congestion?
N.S.W.
PAT O’MAORI.


STORAGE
You can be sure of two
things about batteries.
First, that trouble and ex-
pense originate in the wood
separators used between
the plates of the ordinary
battery; and second, that
the surest way of ending
both annoyances is to buy
a Willard Threaded Rub-
ber Battery, in which the
plates are insulated —not
merely separated.

Thomas Richardson, of Auckland (M.L.),
has just received the congratulations of St.
James’s Scots’ Church. It was his jubilee
as an elder, and there doesn’t seem to be
another record like it in Australasia.
Sydney’s Poverty Point is losing both its
favorite chaplains. As already reported,
George North Ash recently retired from St.
Augustine’s, Neutral Bay, where he had shep-
herded for 34 years; and McKeown, of St.
Mary’s, Waverley—he has two sons on tue
stage—preceded him by a few months.
This Vic. Budget may be the last with
which Minogue, the Under Treasurer, may
be associated. He is by no means elderly,
and retains much of his youthful appear-
ance. but he has had worrying work as
accountant and permanent head for 20
years. He will get at least six months’
leave of absence on full pay.
About the queerest Christian name ever
given in Australia was Abracadabra, with
which the late Canon Childs christened a
nipper on the Clarence River (N.S.W.).
The father, who had come from Cockfighters’
Creek, on the Hunter, explained that it was
the name of a favorite mare, and he wanted
the kid to have it. So the poor kid had it.
“Galleryman”: Instead of holding the
Premiers’ Conference in the big Senate club-
room at Parliament House, and throwing
the greater part of the proceedings open to
the press, the Seven and their satellites
mustered daily in the Federal Cabinet room,
or in as much of it as is outside the big
round table. Any health inspector would
have condemned the place absolutely after
cigars and cigarettes had been going for an
hour. But perhaps Premiers like that kind
of atmosphere.
Before the Victorian Red Cross embarks
on fresh activities the public, which sub-
scribes for the relief of sick and wounded
soldiers, is entitled to know what it costs
to run the organisation and what moneys
are used to pay the bill. It would interest
many to learn, for instance, what the big
Red Cross cars garaged at Government
House are used for, and who pays for the
chauffeurs, and who uses the vehicles, and
why.
“Ex-English” on a successful husband :
The Duke of Wellington has been dead close on
70 years, and would have been aged 152 if living
now; so for his successful rival in the marriage
market to have been on deck till now sounds like
a fairy story. Yet Burdett-Coutts, who has just
died in London, had that honor —and profit. He
was 30 and a mere Bartlett when the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts, whose secretary and disburser of
charity he had been since leaving Oxford, gave him
her hand and millions. This was in 1881, and she
was 67. The young husband helped her to disburse
her money sensibly, was content to assume her
name, and made her happy for the 25 years she
lived. He himself has lasted on till now. And the
Duke of Wellington ? lie had proposed to the Baroness
unsuccessfully, long before, when she was already
wealthy and still young, and when he was elderly
but accustomed to find his will law. Napoleon,
afterwards the Third, had been another unsuccessful
suitor ; but his proposal was considered sheer impu-
dence.
Creswick, Alex. Peacock’s stronghold, had
a beano at the Cup week-end. Old-timers who
had migrated and descendants who had fled
in their youth to other parts to see life or
make a crust flocked back in scores in
response to a call from the village. The
past was vividly revived by the yarns of
the old gold-digging days, of the more
modern times when the Madame Berry and
the Berry Consols mines were turning out
their heavy yields, and of the New Austral-
asian mine disaster in which 22 of the 27
miners entombed lost their lives. Naturally
mention was made of the three Creswick
brothers, John, Charles and Henry, after
whom the town was named. A.T., owner
of racehorses and pastoralist, who has had
his downs as well as his ups, is a son of
Henry. The borough lias now a population
of 1850 as compared with 35,000 or 40,000
early in ’55. Peacock got his wages-board
idea from a plan adopted at Creswick to
settle a mining strike.
“M.R.8.”: Some months ago a concern
in the Speck put up its shutters on the plea
that it couldn’t make profits and didn’t want
to enlarge its losses. Liquidation by arrange-
ment was agreed upon, and as there was
a credit balance of about 10s. in the £l, be-
sides sundry realisable assets, the creditors
looked for an early div. But nobody has
got a bean, and there is no immediate pros-
pect of a settlement. It seems that certain
stuff was marketed on a commission basis,
and the owners of this stuff claim preference.
It should be a simple difficulty to get over,
but it isn’t. Nearly all the lawyers of any
account in the State have had a go at
it, and there are just as many opinions
as there are lawyers. Even the fact that
there is a trust account more than covering
the commission liability does not clear the
way. It comes to this, that the Speck is
the only State in the Commonwealth which
has no law requiring trust moneys to be
banked to a trust account, and seemingly
also is the only country in the world in which
a trust account is no protection when it does
exist.
In return for the £ll5 per week split
among the three lawyer-politicians who share
the law portfolio—a job that in Victoria is
done by one Minister and in Westralia by
the permanent officers of the Crown —-N. S.
Wales gets some valuable information.
Sproule, the Solicitor-General, declared at
Lismore that the abolition of one-twelfth of
the working week hadn’t reduced output.
Asked in the Assembly what he proposed to
do about the swarm of illicit betting-shops
McKell, Minister of Justice, said he didn’t
know they existed, The price of sugar being
referred to immediately afterwards, some-
body inquired of Attorney-General McTier-
nan whether Fijian sugar wasn’t admitted
duty free to Maoriland and heavily taxed in
Australia. McTiernan’s answer was that
he “wasn’t prepared to answer.” That is
what comes of giving three green young men
£ll5 a week for getting in each other’s
way. It would pay Ma better to close down
their deoartments, two of which are per-
fectly useless, pool the salaries for six
months and spend the £2992 10s. on their
neglected education.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“Itellu” : The old plan of backing horses
with seven-letter names was good while it lasted,
Under this system one could select Chester, Carbine,
G'amoola, Trenton, Paul Pry, Tarquin, Wallace,
Wakeful, Carlita, Fluency, Ordella, Wolaroi, Cetigne,
Macadam, Poitrel, Erasmus and many others. This
year, of course, we have Cupidon, Furious and a
few more; but, generally speaking, the charni of
the seven letters lias gone with the fateful glories of
Wilhelm of Germany.
“Y.”: Australian sporting bodies are
thriving out of the “gate.” Last year the English
cricket team put £23,973 into the N.S.W. Associa-
tion’s till, and the Vic. Association got £20,666.
The M.L. Rugby Union now notifies that the Spring-
boks’ tour showed a profit of £lO,OOO. The A.J.C.
Spring meeting had a record crowd; V.R.C. Cup
day was also a record. Surely the bulging coffers
are an appeal for the all-round lowering of admission
charges ?
❖ * * *
“Saaedi”: The District Trot was in pro-
gress at the Wakemup sports. Coming past the
bough shed, which formed the grandstand, a bay
horse was in the lead with a grey rapidly overhaul-
ing him. Alongside the track was a drunk swaying
gently in the wind. Recognising an old friend in
the rider of the grey, he hailed him joyously: “llev !
Rill, old man, llill !” The field swept on. “Rill’s
gettin’ flash,” said Ribulus bitterly. “Wouldn’t
(hie) stop ter tork to a man.”
“Push Off”: The Swedes have a pheno-
menal swimmer in Arne Rorg, a 19-year-old youth who
pushed Reaurepaire closely in the 1500-metres event at
the last Olympiad. At Weston-Super-Mare recently
Rorg annexed the 220yds. English championship in
2min. 29 l-ssec., thus equalling Heaurepaire’s 1920
time. Later he cut out the 440yds. and 500yds. in
smin. 18sec. and 6min. lsec. respectively, doing
that is to say, one second better than Kieran s
record for the first event and 9 3-ssec. better than
the Sydneyite’s figures for the second. Borg is a
“crawl”-style swimmer of fine physique.
“0.K.”: Has any pertinent comment been
passed on the betting-market aspect of the recent
St. Leger result in England? The winner, Pole-
march, started at 50 to 1, the second at 100 to 6,
and the third at B’s. But the moral doesn’t appear
in the prices offered against the placed horses. There
might be a big field for a classic race, even at the
end of the season. In this case there were nine
starters in all. Can any wild, fanciful punter
imagine 50’s, 16’s and B’s being quoted as book-
makers’ prices against the best three out of nine
starters for an A.J.C. or V.R.C. classic three-year-
old event? Could he get 50 to 1, or half the odds,
against any honest goer with a possible chance in a
field of nine? Let him draw his conclusions from
the starting prices on the coming V.R.C. Derby,
though the outsiders, by the way, will be quoted in
Monday’s papers at twice as long as any casual in-
vestor could have obtained for his quid. Published
odds against non-winners seem designed to delude
s.p. backers at a distance.

Sister Olive was named after one of the
owner’s family of girls. He showed his good sense
in not giving the filly a name suggestive of royalty
or the stage, following the rule as regards descend-
ants of Corned}' King’s dam. Jubilee Queen, the
dam of Sister Olive, was the first Australian-born
offspring of Tragedy Queen, imported from England
when she was in foal with Comedy King. A good
friend to Fred Norman was that same Tragedy
Queen. Originally Sol Green’s clerk, the estimable
Norman had already an interest in the business
when Comedy King won Melbourne Cup for Sol
Green, and the win helped considerably to enrich
him. When Green gave up horse-breeding Fred
Norman, who had already taken over Green’s book-
making connection, bought brood mare Jubilee
Queen and bred Sister Olive from her. Or perhaps
he bought the half-sister to Comedy King before
Sol Green had retired from the game. Anyhow it
was on account of her relationship to C.K. that
Norman got possession of the brood mare.
“O.Iv.” : Within my Melbourne Cup ex-
perience I have twice, 1 think, been robbed by
accident of the pleasure of backing the winner. In
1892, the “wet” year, when slushy going enab’ed
a commoner like Glenloth to win easily under the
respectable burden of 7st. 131 b., redoubtable little
Portsea was a four-year-old, weighted at Bst. B’b.
His splendid weight-carrying capacity and staying
powers Were not yet fully recognised—his real excel-
lence was proved later on —but enough was known of
the truth about Portsea to bring his starting price
down to 14 to 1. The heavy ground was suited to
the nuggety little sticker. Portsea was beginning
to work his way towards the middle of the field
when, just as they passed the bridge over the Salt-
water River, something happened. Humphrey Oxen-
ham’s Pilot Bov fell, Portsea fell over him, and Tirail-
leur rolled over Portsea. A more exasperating mis-
hap than that which brought Portsea to grief was
the falling of Marculfus in 1915, the year when
Patrobas won. Marculfus was then a young five-
year-old with a disappointing record, and he had
struck form sure enough. Thrown into the Cup
at 7st. 41b. he was, from the stable viewpoint, a
good thing on paper. A scrimmage, a fall, and
the colors of Marculfus were seen no more. Two
days later he won the Veteran Stakes from St. Spasa,
who was trying to give him 91b., and on the Satur-
day he won the V.R.C. Handicap (If mile) carrying
Bst. 121 b. It was the week of Marculfus’s life, but
he had lost his chance of winning the Cup by the
only fall that ever happened him.
* * * *
Were there no other cause for doubting
whether Eurythmic is quite “another Carbine” the
sound objection would remain that the freak horse
is undoubtedly a somewhat slow beginner. He hasn’t
his wits always about him, and is never slippery off
the mark like the old champion, who ran a
good third in the Newmarket, and could sprint ahead
of the boss two-year-old over six furlongs, and beat
the next-best miler at a mile. Eurythmic was
unfortunate in getting a strand of the starting-
gate in his mouth on Cup day. It might be said
that there was no such starting-gate in Carbine’s
time, but it can be shrewdly argued that the know-
ing customer would have kept out of trouble if
there had. been any chance of his getting into it
The excuse of bad luck in the race was never raised
on Carbine’s behalf. No plea was ever made for him
on the score of condition save in the October and
November of his four-year-old career, when he was
beaten in four races out of five, and his poor feet
so far failed him that he finished fourth in a field of
four on the last day of the Cup meeting—the only
time he was ever beaten out of a place in handicap
or w.f.a. events. But even at that meeting Carbine
ran second to Bravo for the Cup, carrying 10 stone,
and on the Thursday he was equal to winning the
Flying Stakes (7 furlongs) from Derby winner
Dreadnought, who was an uncommon Derby winner,
bear in mind. When Eurythmic failed, at four years
old, in his first Melbourne Cup, he carried 101 b. less
than 10 stone, and finished only fourth. But the
main point in the contention is that Eurythmic
doesn’t get quickly away or always put himself
in a winning position nearing home, as Carbine did.
The freak horse was said to have done something
wonderful in winning last Sydney Cup after his
position had looked hopeless not far from home.
Carbine never left himself with a lot of ground to
make up in the last stage of a Cup race. He was
in front at the distance when Bravo came along
and beat him a length. When he bore his lOst. 51b,
ahead of 38 horses, on the great day of his great
life, he was among the leading 10 from the start,
was third at the turn for home, and had a lead of
a length or more at the distance. Then Ramage
shook his whip at Carbine and the old horse put
another two lengths of daylight between himself and
his nearest pursuers. He took the hint and flew.

The N. S. Wales Orchestra was announced
to wind up its Melbourne season with a
matinee concert to-day (Thursday). General
Opinion has nothing but approving words
for the orchestral performances. Since Ver-
brugghen was last here the playing lias
most improved where it was least sure oi
itself, and the certain results of continual
practice are evident in the ensemble.
Wagner had nearly everything to say on
Thursday night, the conductor being at quite
his best in his interpretation of that sav-
agely German master of sound and fury. But
Wagner is a very powerful drug when taken
without opera, and should never be adminis-
tered in large (loses, except in desperate
cases of insomnia and nervous breakdown,
where the prescription is Kill or Cure. A
feature of the concert last Saturday night
was the comparative weakness of the lady
vocalist, Miss Biddell, but the accompani-
ments to her arias were worth hearing. The
same cannot be said of Vaughan Williams’s
“A London Symphony,” played for the first
time in Melbourne at the Saturday matinee.
The Symphony, professing to reflec 4 : “varied
scenes of life in a exeat city from dawn to
dusk,” was not less pretentiously puny in
achievement that Dvorak’s “Amidst Nature”
overture, which preceded it. Dvorak had
no more power to depict in music a field of
turnips or a wild crab-apple tree than Wil-
liams had to suggest school life, factory life,
a rush of women to a bargain sale, a slump
in the jewellery trade or the domestic
monotony of making the beds and washing-
up. All these things are all-important
phases of city life, like toothache and going-
out to lunch. Vaughan Williams never
touched any of them. The harpist twanged
the hour of 12 and then the city went to
sleep, seemingly, whereas it was the time
when a lot of people would be thinking of
sausage and baked potato at a korfy stall.
* * £
Whilst the Gilbert and Sullivan pro-
gramme has been changing three and four
times a week at Melbourne Majesty’s the
understudies have been getting their chance,
and new vocal talent has come to hearing.
For instance, Bryl (if it isn’t a misprint
for Beryl) Walkley played Elsie in a
matinee of “Yeomen of the Guard,” and
“HER UNBORN CHILD ,” AT SYDNEY
OPERA HOUSE.
George Cross as Ted Livingstone (a name-
less orphan).
though she was but a gentle reminder of
Strella Wilson in the part, she helped to
sweeten the somewhat hard unsentimentality
of Charles Mettam as Colonel Fairfax. Met-
tam’s keen and vigorous tenor, though only
half cultivated, carries him through the job,
but his acting, like his warble, needs more
polish, particularly for the part of a Colonel
and a scholar whose first duty in opera is
to look distinguished. Besides, Miss Bryl
aforesaid was the- most brunette Elsie this
writer can remember, and she served to dis-
pel the impression thut Jack Point, tne
Jester, always breaks Ins heart for blondes.
Grace Grotty got chances during the week,
and on Saturday she was the fair plaintiff in
“Trial by Jury,” a part to which, of yore,
the decorative airs and graces of ISeliie
Stewart were particularly well suited. Miss
Grotty is not yet a brilliant exponent of
airs and graces, but she has a pure soprano
voice of pretty quality, which omy requires
to be brought forward and wisely aumon-
ished. At present it has the disposition to
lean back in her throat.
“Trial by Jury” and “Pinafore” started
the last round of the G. and S. revival, and
kept plump and not unpopular John Ral-
ston busy all the evening. John was me
only one of the principals to figure in both
parts of the bill. His work as the Bosun’s
Mate was as good as you can get in the
character. Walenn, as Sir Joseph Porter,
showed no more signs of recent sickness; but
Hay, though he brought out all the humor of
Ralph Rackstraw’s lines, failed to conceal
the fact that his metallic top note is badly
in want of fresh electroplating. The girls
carried more guns than the men principals
aboard the Pinafore, positions being re-
versed in the case of the chorus. Molly
Tyrell, except that she set the alleged rav-
ages of Time at open defiance, was a capital
Buttercup; Bryl Walkley made a charm-
ingly unassertive leader of the Sisters,
Cousins and Aunts; and Strella Wilson
went one (or three) better than her capital
Josephine of last year. Her fine, healthy
sinking voice dominated the show, her bright
intelligence was always alert to histrionic
requirements, and for such a big, bouncing
prima-donna she was remarkably graceful.
Still, Miss Wilson’s diction —in speech
rather than in song—could do with a little
refining. She is out of the bill of “lolanthe,”
which ends the season to-morrow (Fri-
day), but will be soprano-in-chief in "Merrie
England,” the opera by Edward German and
Basil Hoed, due on Saturday.
Melbourne Royal is preparing- to receive
“The Sign on the Door” in place of “Firefly,”
which declares its innings closed to-night
(Thursday). Touching “The Sign on the Door”
The Bulletin had some uncomplimentarv
things to say last week, but the voice of
truth crying in the wilderness has not
drowned the clink of the cash support that is
liable to come to any machine-made ’Murkau
melodrama with a murder in it. Besides,
the private-room scene at the restaurant in
the prologue is almost as highly flavored as
the bedroom episode in “Scandal.”
sjs :]< s;<
Marie Tempest and Graham Browne are
returning to Melbourne King’s on Saturday
to play a quick round of farewells. Before
getting on to something else they will test
the possibilities of “Mr. Pim Passes By,”
which had all the appearance, last time they
left Melbourne, of being a huge success cut
short in its early youth.
*v * *
Ella Shields, making her first appearance
in Melbourne Tivoli at the Saturday
matinee, was evidently nervous, and had
failed to get the pitch of the house; all the
same, she promised to become Melbourne’s
best girl in boy’s clothing. Her personality
is winsome, and her quiet method of charac-
ter acting has an appeal in it. She idealises
the male characters she impersonates, and
nobody will object to that. Others have
harshly realised, or caricatured, the awful
futility of the seedy impostor who lives on
the smell of an oil rag and the fumes of
gentility, but the Burlington Bertie of Bow
created by Ella Shields is a glorified ass,
with pathos in his pretence.
Melbourne remains on the best of terms
with Wirths’ Circus, where roaring beasts
of prey act as spruikers, and elephants
stand sentinel near the entrance to the inner
temple. The circus has added Flying
Lloyds to its original galaxy of world-beating
attractions, these aerial visitants being the
first to arrive of a number of people, things
and miracles that George Wirth has shipped
from foreign shores.
* >:« * *
Melbourne Majestic’s latest offerings are
“Other Men’s Shoes” and “The Gates of
Brass.” The latter, a mystery story with
Frank Keenan showing his teeth in the tight
places, is fairly striking in its sensational-
ism, but the other is devoted to the tame
theme of a rough mining man impersonating
his parson brother. Beauteous Elaine Ham-
merstein is the pick of Hoyt’s basket in
“Handcuffs and Kisses.” Though the story
becomes sultry in places, Elaine emerges
spotless and ravishing to kindle the affec-
tions of a pure district attorney. “The
Big Adventure,” which also canters across
Hoyt’s screen, is mostly remarkable for the
big ~ part played by the juvenile Breezy
Eason and his dorg. “While the Billy
Boils,” Beaumont Smith’s version of Law-
son’s classic, is the current winner at the
Melba; and supporters of the Britannia are
finding one hanky insufficient for a com-
fortable view of Thomas H. Ince’s pro-
tracted sob, “Mother o’ Mine.”
“Paddy, the Next Best Thing,” having
romped off the Sydney Criterion boards,
“Peg o’ My Heart” was revived on Saturday
by general desire of the management. It
would have been easy to find a play more
suitable for revival. Certainly there are
none of the qualities of permanence in the
Irish-American "Peg.” In a few years it
will be as dead as the dramatic pieces of the
elder Boucicault. Other playwrights have
learned the trick, or box of tricks, which
Hartley Manners exploited so successfully a
decade ago, and the humor which in those
days was pronounced full-bodied and spon-
taneous nowadays seems forced and th.n.
Comparisons being inevitable, if odorous,
Isobel Brosnan’s Peg is sprightlier and more
vigorous than that of the lady who intro-
duced the part to Australia, but she is not
so effective in the quieter scenes. There
are times when Isobel would be more pleas-
ing if she contrived to put a brake on her
boisterous spirits. Talent she has, and also
charm, but her acting is apt to be too gym-
nastic for the situation. Miss Brosnan is
adequately supported by Mrs. Brough, in her
old rsle of Mrs. Chichester, and by Doris
Kendal as cousin Ethel. Charlie Court-
neidge’s droll work as Alaric shows that he
has inherited a lot of his father’s ability.
Arthur Greenaway, Gerald Iv. Souper and
Fred Cambourne are each capital in parts
that don’t greatly matter. But good-looking
Anew McMaster is an uncommonly stilted
lover.

At Sydney Strand and Haymarket in
“Man-Woman-Marriage,” the overloaded
screen visibly bends under the strain of three
parallel stories of the sex warfare. Lyceum
and Lyric offer a heady brew made up of
apaches, crooks, stolen gems, and the refor-
mation of Thomas Meighan through the
timely inheritance of a vast fortune. Cabaret
scenes and the weird fascinations of the
Paris underworld as seen by the film man
add a dash of peppermint to the well-chewed
gum of the story, which is branded “White
and Unmanned.” Elizabeth Robins’s novel,
“The Hark Lantern,” is presented at the same
houses. Edna Ferber’s book, “Fanny Her-
self,” gets a headline at Hoyt’s, the Picca-
dilly and Australia. The title is changed to
“No Woman Knows,” and a drunk, swaying
in front of the sign on the opening night
and rocking back and forward, giggled softly.
“You got it wrong, mister,” lie suddenly
burst out in confidence. “One whiff and my
old woman can tell.”

Joseph Coyne, older than when he used to
be Prince Danilo, but full of artistry, has
had a week of a poor American farce at
Adelaide Royal. Marie La Varre runs in
and out of doors, and jumps into cupboards
and tubs, in sketchy attire, and Sydney Stirl-
ing and other clever people do their best
with the moderate material supplied by the
authoresses. At the P. of W. is a melodrama
of unusual possibilities, “The Oueen of the
Slums,” in which Leslie Adrienne is a Cock-
ney heroine educated up to the drawing-room
standard, where a young parson awaits her.
With luck this might have been another
“Peg o’ My Heart.” At the King’s is
Nadje, a shapely circumstance whether
overdressed or reduced to the minimum; also
Nellie Ivolle continues her popular appeal,

and the revue co. is the same thing slightly
different each week. The Majestic is having
a great time with the Dempsey-Carpentier
film. At West’s, in “The Cup of Life,”
Hobart Bosworth is a singularly attractive
old scamp doing business in China, and a
trained baboon provides the comic relief. In
“The Faith Healer,” at Wondergraph, is
worked something strongly resembling an
actual miracle; it is the kind of picture that
could have come only from America. A Wil-
liamsonian “English Pierrot” co. is taking
advantage of the early summer to start in
the open at Austral Gardens.

Two decorative shows in Melbourne: —
Some aspects of the fairyland' of Ethel Jackson
Morris’s imagining may be seen at the home of the
Fine Art Society. Miss Morris’s decorations recall
the work of Ida Rentoul, but she gets more vitality
into her figures, whilst her color washes are more
varied and luminous. She has a fine eye for design,
and scores heavily in subjects like “Autumn Winds,”
wherein the falling vegetation flutters in dabs of
bronze over a delicate foreground. A verse of Yeats
is illustrated in a nocturnal symphony (No. 29), in
which mystery abounds, and there are several more
of the same significance appealing in their fantasy
and pictorial quality. Her small studies of single
figures are also striking examples of her talent.
Connoisseurs of etching will be attracted by the
Painter-Etchers’ Society’s first big display at the
Decoration Gallery. The catalogue mentions 215
items, and, though the hanging committee might
have increased the artistic value of the show by a
higher standard of selection, the effect, on the whole,
is very impressive. As usual, Norman Lindsay col-
lects the largest audience with his fanciful composi-
tions. His idea of Beethoven is one of his cleverest
efforts in decorative symbolism. It is singular in
its grouping and in the masterly dexterity revealed
in the strong, forbidding foreground. “Virginity,”
another sumptuous print, might be called the sar-
donic caprice of a pagan imagination. The best
work is in the background of dim figures caught in
the first movement of a Dionysian revel. Several
familiar Spanish plates appear in brother Lionel’s
panel, and among his new efforts there is a beguiling
little study, “The Tinsmith’s Shop.” H. van Raalte’s
drypoints are marked by dreamy poetic qualities, and
he contributes a graceful aquatint in brown and
chocolate tonao —“Banks of the Blackwood.” Bruce
Robertson becomes more charming on further ac-
quaintance. His two plates of old overhanging houses
in Dinan, France, are heavily charged with person-
ality, like his picturesque conception of “The Coming
Storm, Pittenween, Fife.” Fred Campbell’s aqua-
tinted landscapes seem slight and uninviting, and
John Shirlow’s section of the wall space is mottled
with familiar visions of Melbourne architecture. The
name of Sydney Ure Smith figures on a number of
fresh achievements. He is meticulous in technique
and choice of subject, as in “The Three Barns.”
Edith Hope suggests warm color and. fine: drawing in
“Venetian Boatyard,” and Jessie Traill .scorns the
conventions of the average etcher for broad and sweep-
ing designs on a comparatively grandiose plan. Her
snapshot of a tearing river in Saskatchewan, Canada,
is a capital performance. Herbert Rose is a fairly
soulful Baedeker of Melbourne streets, whilst Henry
Fullwood has squandered some emotion in the depic-
tion of Melbourne banks. Eirene Mort is not alto-
gether successful in “The Sentinel,” and there might
be more picture and less needlework in Linbv
Richardson’s “Summer’s Day, Wellington, M.L.” The
delicate handling of Gayfield Shaw’s petite “Hillside
Dairy” is evidence of a keen sense of color valuer,
and David Barker’s quartette leaves no blot on his
reputation. Of the others, Alfred Coffey is most
conspicuous for the insistent vigor of his line, notice-
ably in “The Mouth of the Creek” and “In the
Shade of the Casuarina.”

“0.K.” on a forgotten opera:—
How comes it, I wonder, that the three-volume
edition of W. S. Gilbert’s plays excludes “Princess
Toto,” written at the time of Gilbert’s first estrange-
ment from Sullivan. “The Mountebanks,’’ written
at the time of the testy author’s second estrange-
ment, and first produced in January, 1892, is in-
cluded, although the success of this Gilbert and
Cellier collaboration was not great, and the memory
of it could have been no more satisfactory to the
librettist than that of his first attempt to find an-
other Sullivan. Frederick Clay supplied the music
for “Princess Toto,” whose London production was
in 1886 or earlier. In June, 1886, it got a chance
in Melbourne, at the old Opera House, subleased
from Rignold and Allison by a Mr. S. Moore, who
had procured the acting rights from Wybert Reeve.
Perhaps the prima-donna, Annette Ivanova, pre-
judiced the venture, for she had little sweetness in
her voice or charm in her personality. W ith un-
attractive Ivanova in the name-part, and middle-
aged Armes Beaumont as her lover, the romantic

side of the opera never got theatre-goers talking,
and although Robert Brough, as a light-comedy
Prime Minister to King Portico Kelly),
made a decided hit, he filled only a short engage-
ment before going off to England to help Dot Bouci-
cault engage principals for their own companies. So
the production made no lasting impression on the
public. There was smart and witty writing in it
that goes without saying ; in his try to establish a
collaboration with Clay instead of renewing the old
alliance with Arthur S., the librettist was bound to
put in good work. The story turned on the fantastic
forgetfulness of the Princess, which kept the Court
in a state of droll anxiety. Emma Temple, b\ the
way, played confidential attendant on her Royal
Highness, and Aggie Kelton was the only other lady
in the cast. Among the men were two members of
J.C'.W. cos. of to-day, more than 35 years later.
John Forde, who was even then an old identity,
played Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister Brough,
and Fred England was one of the also sangs.
From Moses Baritz in Manchester: —
We had a visit from a Sydney tenor recently.
His name is Cecil Sherwood. He did not appear
publicly, but vocalised in private for the benefit of
a few connoisseurs. His singing was simply sensa-
tional. He has been studying in Milan under Piera-
cinni, who thinks he has the world’s greatest tenor
in hand. Sherwood went back at the urgent request
of his agent, and had the honor of opening the new
Opera House .at Gorizia two weeks ago, singing the
Duke’s part in “Rigoletto.” His triumph was mas-
sive. As a sequel he is to be engaged at La Scala
as one of the principal tenors during the coming
season. One well-known concert-manager offered
Sherwood more money for an appearance here than
anv English tenor I know of could command. And
he" refused. This all sounds extravagant, I know;
but —wait!

“Ancient “Prompter”: In answer to
“Jobber” (B. 10/11/’2l), who says I am
“off the track” in mentioning that Arthur
Wontner made his first Australian appear-
ance in “Resurrection,” I can only say that
I was one of the Beerbohm Tree company
which, including Julius Knight, Maude Jet-
fries and Wontner, left England in July,
1903, and opened in the September following
at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, m the adap-
tation of the Tolstoi "iece.. Also I possess
a programme of mir opening performance,
and underneath Wontner’s name appears the
line “His first appearance in Australia, feo
whoever the Wontner was that played in
“Midsummer Night’s Dream” he was assur-
edly not the Arthur I spoke of.
“Nero”: Arthur Wontner (B. 10/11/21)
came to Australia with the Beerbohm Tree
Co. which opened at H r Majesty s. Mel-
bourne, in August or September, 1903, and
played “Resurrection,” “Beaucaire and
“The Eternal City.” The pieces were pro-
duced by Clyde Meynell, who was Trees
representative. The imported members ot
the co. were Maude Jeffries, Olive Noble,
Rose Pendennis, Arthur Wontner, Eardley
Turner. E. A. Warburton and Maude s
brother Norman. Later “The Darling of the
Gods” was added to the repertoire, and H.
W Yarna was sent from London to produce
it.’ During the first Melbourne season
Wontner -”id Rose Pendennis were married.
The ceremony took place on the day F.J.A.
won the V.R < . Derby, and at the conclusion
of the performance of Beaucaire the
orchestra played the “Wedding March” and
a huge bridal bouquet was handed up to the
lady.
“10-2-4” • “T.W.” overstates the case
when he says (B. 10/11/’2l) that in London
“once an artist has slanged the playgoer
from over the footlights his chances of re-
employment go down to zero.” Here, as m
other directions,
That in the captain’s but a choleric word
Which in the private is flat blasphemy.
Henry Irving (sen.), Forbes Robertson and
William Rignold all delivered rebukes to
audiences without suffering for it in any
way. On the ’Alls the practice has always
been fairly common, though, of course,
fiercely reprobated by the managements m
the case of minor stars. “Little Tich” —
extremely irritable, like all freaks—was a
notable offender, but it never cost him an
engagement. When Harry Rickards was
running Sydney Tivoli according to the
rigor of the variety-show game as played
in the West End of London, he engaged
Sims Reeves’s widow to give imitations of
the great tenor. It was an indescribably
absurd turn, and the house was highly
diverted. I had the misfortune to be in a
box, and she turned on my party and used
us as whipping-blocks for the whole audi-
ence. Rickards, outraged in every fibre of
his being as an impresario, hurried round
to apologise. But the lady was not sacked.
For that matter, G. W. Anson, whom
“T.W.” mentions, was given no indication
by any London management that he was
unwelcome as a result of his little break.
He was temperamental, and felt so wretched
after the row with his audience that, though
pressed to stay, he decided to clear out for
a while. Julius Knight, who knew him well,
told me this.
“O.Iv.”: One of the comic operas that
never get the revival due to them (being, as
a rule, beyond the strength of a modern
J.C.W. co.’s resources) is “The Rose of Per-
sia.” It is full of charming music by Arthur
Suilivan, and Captain Basil Hood’s “book
would come as a boon after the foolishness
of “Lilac Domino,” “Firefly,” “Irene.” etc.
One reason why the title of Sullivan’s last
opera soon dropped out of Australian remi-
niscence was the colored nature of the
characters. They were all dusky heathens,
with names too foreign or too long to re-
member. Maud Chetwynd was Scent-of-
Lilies and Carrie Moor" was Heart’s Desire,
the heroine being Sultana Zubeydeh. known
as Rose-in-Bloom (in brackets). The pub-
lic never speaks familiarly of theatrical
characters by names like those, though the
piece they play in may have a long run,
like “Kismet” or “Chu Chin Chow. The
Rose of Persia” didn’t have long runs when
J.C.W. produced it 21 years ago, and the
immediate reason for its comparative failure
was the weakness of the leading lady, Ada
Winston Weir. She had no punch.
Described on the bill as “Soprano, from the
Principal London Theatres,” the lady looked
and sounded rather like an amateur in dis-
guise. She left no footsteps on the local
sands of time, that Ada from the Principal
London Theatres. Old stagers still remem-
ber how Leonora Braham came from Eng-
land to play the name-part in the first Aus-
tralian production of “Dorothy” more than
30 years ago, but they have clean forgotten
the one and only exponent of “The Rose of
Persia” 20 years ago. Now, Gladys Mon-
crieff in the part would not be forgotten.
A revival of Arthur Sullivan’s opera, with
Gladys and a competent singing company,
might boom as the original production never
had a chance to do.
“Ex-Eng.”: John Dripkwater, poet and
playwright, graduated (like Pinero) from
the stage, and (unlike Pinero) likes to get
back to it occasionally. In the recent
Shakspearean season in Paris, he played
Banquo to James K. Hackett’s Macbeth;
and at the 100th performance of “Abraham
Lincoln” at the Lyceum, London, the author
himself appeared as the Chorus or Chronicler,
who knits the action together with a descrip-
tive speech before each act.
“Adelaide”: The York, Adelaide’s new
picture-house at the corner of Rundle-stieet
and Gawler-place is (of course) “the most
luxurious of the kind in the Southern Hemi-
sphere.” It is built on a small frontage—
which cost a record price—and goes a long
way up, giving room for many offices. It
has been built by Clarke, of Adelaide, but
the architects, Karberry and Chard, are ot
Sydney; also Coulter and Butler, -who have
done the interior decoration. The Greater
Wondergraph Co. owns it, and managing-
director Finkelstein gave a party to celebrate
the oDening. The house-manager is Claude
Webb. „ /T ,
“Peter”: “The Beggar’s Opera (B.
3/11/’2l) owes a lot of its recent English
success to the picturesque scenery and cos-
tumes designed by Lovat Fraser, who lately
passed out in London. By the way, a brilli-
ant new edition of Gay’s satire is promised,
containing reproductions of some illustra-
tions which Fraser had-just completed before
he died.
“Billy T.”: I once. saw. Melba betray
ordinary feminine emotions in the face of a
hearty and almost unanimous burst of laugh-
ter that greeted her appearance in a box at
Her Majesty’s. The Diva’s hand went in-
stinctively to her hair, as is invariably the
case with her sisterhood in such circum-
stances. The first impulsive demand of
woman in the teeth of apparent derision is
“Is my hat on straight?” If the hat is
absent, then it is a question of the hair
being seriously misplaced. A flushed diva
sought enlightenment in the crush room, and
there learned the explanatory truth—for
the last quarter of an hour a large part, of
the audience had been rapturously applaud-
ing another plump dame in a conspicuous
part of the theatre, under the impression
that it was she.
“Meataxe”: Hobart Royal is the oldest
theatre in the Commonwealth. Records
held by H. C. Frahm show that the founda-
tion-stone was laid by J- A rc V 5I ’ J 1 c<l\ e
Speck’s civil engineer, on 4, 1004,
and that the official opening occurred on
“THEODORE AND CO.” AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Field Fisher as Crump.
March 6, 1836. On that day about 1000
people, including the committee and share-
holders, marched from the Bird in Hand
Hotel in Argyle-street to see Morton’s
comedy, “Speed the Plough,” and “The
Spoiled Child,” and to hear the noise from
the 21st Fusilier Band.
“S.S.” : The picture of the fight between
Dempsey and Carpentier got hold of a
highly susceptible little Irishman in my
vicinity, who barracked noisily for Demp-
sey. He liked the'name. “Hit him, Demp-
sey ! Ah-li-h, give him another, Dempsey.
Kill the furrin’ bla’guard, Dempsey ! Sure,
wasn’t me ould mother one of the Demp-
seys? Huh, that’ll finish him, Dempsey.”
Then he stood up, swinging his hat and
roaring, “Dempsey ! Dempsey! Dempsey!”
Responding to a thunderous demand, he sat
down, while a neighbor whispered: “Here,
Irish, don’t be so hard on the Frenchman.
If he isn’t Irish, he is a good Catholic.”
“Is that so?” demanded Dempsey’s friend.
“Is that so?” Followed brief quiet. Then
said the excitable barracker, in mild ex-
postulation: “No so harrd, Dempsey. Dont
hit the poor b’y so harrd —’tis quite unneces-
sary.”
“Oh, the expense of running a show
here!” writes M. P. Adams from London.
“T do more work in Australia than six pic-
ture-theatre managers get through _ here.
They are drones, to my way of thinking,
but they draw £lOOO and £l2OO a year for
droning.” Adams, though, forgets to allow
for the fact that he is a whirler even among
Australian showmen. An all-round amateur
athlete before he started to hustle for a
living, he found an early vent for his ener-
gies with Wirths’ Circus; and having been
an indefatigable circus-booster and general-
business man for two years, he couldn’t let
his mental muscles slacken if he tried.
Among his hundred and one sidelines in the
early twenties of his swift career was a
rort'y little book on spielers, which, by the
way', he dedicated to “Edmund Fisher, My
Friend,” without malicious intent.
“Fax”: Talking of Ella Shields at the
Tivoli, billed as the legitimate successor to
Vesta Tilley in male impersonation, a tre-
mendous hit in that way is said to have been
lately scored by Cicely Courtneidge, now ap-
pearing with her clever husband at the
Royalty Theatre, London. A good judge
credits her with being “the best ever” m
looks and performance, and predicts a big
future for her as a “boy” specialist. W hich,
considering that she has been getting her
£lOO a week as a girl in vaudeville, sug-
gests that the Australian-born artist must
have struck it rich in her husband’s new
sketch.
“T. 0.1.”: As far back as the mid-’sixties.
after the departure of Barry Sullivan for
England, Melbourne Theatre Royal was
leased by a syndicate of actors who earned
on successfully for some time —Charles \ in-
cent, J. C. Lambert, H. R. Harwood,
Richard Stewart, Thos. Bellair and John
Hennings. Vincent died from lockjaw, the
result of a fall from a horse. Lambert re-
tired from the stage and went to end his
days at his native Wells. Harwood and
Stewart invested their savings in certain
Melbourne institutions, and commenced to
enjoy their -well-earned rest, but the boom-
burst ruined them and they had to gra
again. Bellair invested his money in *
good hotel at Wagga. John Hennings
scenic artist, had his cash safely stowed,
yet plodded on with his brush.

“The smile of the Prince has completely conquered
Gibraltar. ’ ’ —Ca lie.
The prince of old rode forth in arms,
The meat-axe clanging as he went;

Because his ways were known to fame —
He chopped them up unless they did.
The dancing-girl upon her toes
Came in to twirl her skirts at Court;
The gorging warriors sat in rows
And watched her supple limbs disport.
There to their drunken loud applause
She capered in her languid style;
And won their iron hearts because
Her chief top-garment was her smile.
The prince to-day is clad in tweed,
He walks about like other men,
But needs must pay a special heed
To certain persons of the pen.
His smile is like a tender rose,
New-opened on the breast of spring;
And by its constant use it shows
The wearer’s father- is a king.
The dancing-girl who twirls to-day
Is hardly pressed to earn her bread ;
The smiles that drove men’s hearts astray
To other eyes and lips have fled.
What wonder if with axe in hand
She lead the revolution mob,
And make the wide world understand
A royal prince has pinched her job?

How to stop the Blowfly!
Government Committee proves Jetting; effective.
So serious have been the ravages of the blowfly on Australian flocks, and so
bad is the outlook this season, that the Federal Institute of Science and
Industry appointed a special Blowfly Committee to make investigations.
The Committee’s experiments were carried out on the property of Mr. W.
Russell, the well-known pastoralist, of Dalmally, Queensland, whose sheep-
jetting race is shown in this advertisement. After endless tests, they
proved that Jetting with Arsenical Solutions gave almost complete immunity
to flocks for a period of from two to three months. It was found that, to
be successful, Jetting must be done with a high-pressure plant, combining an
efficient Agitator for keeping the heavy Arsenical Solution at the proper
strength.
One fine result of Mr. Russell’s experience is reported from Mr. Linton’s
property at Mt. Abundance, where 12,000 young ewes, badly blown, with ten
months wool on, were Jetted with a Comet Plant. These sheep were shorn
six weeks later, and, with the exception of two or three, were found free
from infestation. To the Comet Jetter, the Manager gives credit for saving
at least 900 ewes.

Comet Power
Sheep Jetter.
As a result of experience gained from pastoralists in the actual
Jetting of sheep, the Comet Power Sheep Jetter represents the
most efficient and economical plant obtainable. One man can
handle 1500 sheep a day, at a cost of about one-fifth of a penny
per sheep. There is no necessity for crutching.
The Comet Sheep Jetter is the only real preventive for blow-
fly. This has been proved by numerous pastoralists throughout
Australia. All parts are especially made to resist corrosion of
the strong Arsenical Solutions, and the Comet Agitator gives
a perfect mixture all the time.
The Comet Sheep Jetter can be supplied complete
as illustrated, with Vertical or Horizontal Engine,
or can be supplied without engine, to be driven
by ordinary farm power. Booklet with full
particulars of Comet Sheep Jetting Plants, and
complete information regarding their use, will be
sent on request.

TESTIMONIAL.
Eversham Station,
Eongreach,
24/7/1931.
We jetted about 60,000 sheep here this year, using'
one of your plants. It gave complete satisfaction,
never requiring any attention hut feeding with petrol
and oil. I consider 3000 sheep jetted properly by
two men are as many as can be put through in a
day. The sheep, if properly jetted, should be quite
safe from losses from flies for about eight weeks.

The most interesting racehorse of the
moment is Heir Apparent, a three-year-old son of
Comedy King, of whom little or nothing was known
until he beat Harvest King and others in the Bat-
man Stakes at Flemington. The price paid at auction
for the hero, three days after his unexpected victory,
was an indirect compliment to Harvest King and
others. The trainer of Heir Apparent, who ought
to know something about the real strength of the
colt’s triumph over a little lot of horses of his own
age, bid up to 3200
guineas, for himself
or a client; but H.
A. Armytage went
100 guineas better. It
remains to be seen
whether Heir Appa-
rent is worth a third
of the _ money for
racing purposes. Put
up for auction pre-
vious to the race at
Flemington he would
not have fetched a
sixth of the price. If
he be really worth all
that money it is cer-
tain that his value
was not dimly sus-
pected by the “heads”
prior to his sensa-
tional win, otherwise
he would not have
been the despised out-
sider of the field.
“TONY”

The reasonable suggestion is made that
final acceptances for a Melbourne Cup, or any other
richly endowed handicap race, should cost the owner
not less than one per cent, the amount of the added
money. For instance, the latest Melbourne Cup
had an £BOOO bonus, and the starters should have
contributed £BO each to the pool. An owner
who was not prepared to risk a final acceptance
fee equal to a hundredth part of the Club’s induce-
ment—to take, in short, a bet of 100 to 1 to the
extent of £Bo—could not have been regarded as a
genuine competitor. Under present conditions there
is too much weight attaching to the wild offers of
Tatt.'s ticket holders, who, having drawn horses
with practically no chance whatever of winning a
prize, w'ant their respective dud candidates to be
starters. The presence of duffers, that can do
nothing but cause trouble in a crowded field, should
be discouraged.
* * * *
“0.K.”: Consider the form, how it was
reversed, upset and made an utter fool of from the
first day of the A.J.C. Spring meeting to the last
day of the carnival at Williamstown. Let it be
admitted at the outset that the two big handicap
failures of David should not, perhaps, have been
as surprising as they were to the public that judged
his chances on his w.f.a. work. What did David
beat in the Spring Stakes on the first day at Rand-
wick? Syne Knight, Swift Shot, Kennaquhair, Sali-
tros, Fairy Bob and Violoncello, of whom the last-
named only was not either gone off or going off at
the time. Subsequent events showed that David
did nothing necessarily great in defeating Swift
Shot, Syce Knight and Salitros in two w.f.a. races
at the A.J.C. meeting. His victory in the Rand-
wick Plate was headlined as a “fine performance,”
but it was merely a defeat of three jaded oppo-
nents in rather slow time for the two miles. The
same trio competed with him in the Metropolitan,
and one of them —Syce Knight—was backed down to
4 to 1 when David was figuring at 5 to 2, but they
were well beaten. The facts of the A.J.C. meeting sug-
gest that David was lucky in having nothing much
against him in two valuable w.f.a. events, and was
really a false favorite, at 6 to 1, for the Melbourne
Cup, wherein he ran worse than in the Met. a month
earlier. Now, the places in the Metropolitan were
filled by Laddie Blue, Prince Sandy and Erasmus,
all of whom went to Melbourne within the next
few days, and seemingly went amiss through change
of climate. A blight seems to have fallen on every-
thing that ran in the Metropolitan, save only Wirra-
way, who also went to Melbourne and did remark-
ably well. A blight fell also on the three horses that
earned place money in the Caulfield Cup—Violoncello,
Purser and Lionel Attwill. The English stallion
certainly ran a good race in the Melbourne Stakes,
but his Cup performance w'as worse than that of
Purser and Attwill, whereas Sister Olive, who fin-
ished fourth at Caulfield, won Melbourne Cup nicely,
after which a blight fell on her and the two nags that
followed her home—The Rover and Amazonia.
Wren’s horse started at 2 to 1 for the Williamstown
Cup, and was beaten out of a place, thus complet-
ing the chapter of downfalls of favorites this season.
David went out at 5 to 2 for the Metropolitan and
finished nowhere. Tangalooma started at 3 to 1
for the Caulfield Cup and finished nowhere.
There also finished Eurythmie and his four
nearest companions in the Melbourne Cup
betting. But of all the disappointing favorites
Tangalooma was most conspicuous. A fortnight
previous to the Caulfield Cup he could have won the
race easily at his weight, yet on the day he was
a trifle off, and he finished no nearer than seventh.
A week later Wirraway beat him at Moonee Valley.
Another week later Tangalooma was stronglv fancied
for another 12 furlongs race—the Hotham Handi-
cap at Flemington—and was said to have been
unlucky in running only fourth. All the same, he
started at an outside price for the Melbourne Cup
and finished fifteenth. At the end of the same week
Tangalooma proved himself back in his best form
by romping home in a w.f.a. race, and on the fol-
lowing Monday he won Williamstown Cup in bril-
liant style from the more consistent Wirraway.
Soft going- may be supposed to have beaten him in
the one Cup, and in the other the distance was at
least a quarter of a mile too far for him.
* * * *■
Purser compensated his backers for tbeir
larger Cup losses by winning the Armadale Cup at
Caulfield last Saturday. All things considered, the
wonder was that an extra stone and half should
have put him back to 10 to 1 in the betting, whiV t
Harvest King, who also had another 211 b. to carry,
was quoted at s’s. Harvest King ran badly, as it
happened, almost as badly as Honey Bee, who evi-
dently was expected to do better on the Caulfield
course than he had done at Flemington. The handi-
cap was on a high scale, so the raising of a sturdy
five-year-old from 7st. 71b. to Bst. 131 b. ought not to
have been regarded as a matter of much consequence.
The race proved quite a good thing for Purser, the
time being a good deal farter than when Violoncello
won the muddy C.C. over the same course. After a slow
beginning Purser had worked into third place as
they rounded the turn for home, and the rest was
easy. He had only Switch and Paratoo left to beat,
and in such company the son of Sea Prince and Paper
Money is a horse of great importance. Evidently he
nas unlucky to lose the Caulfield Cup.
“0.K.”: The apology made for Tanga-
looma that he has a dislike to a large field hardlv
accounts for his in-and-out form these last few week'.
Certainly there was a small field in the Williamstown
Cup, which Tangalooma won so brilliantly, but there
was a smaller field in the Moonee Valley Cup, where
he was backed down to 2 to 1, and couldn’t make a
final effort against Wirraway. In the Herbert Power
Stakes at Caulfield Tangalooma ran so disappointingly
in a small field as to suggest the possibility of a Cup
failure which came three days later. My theory is
that the tall gelding was a trifle overstrung in the
fortnight prior to Caulfield Cup, but was not abso-
lutely stale. A little easing up in his work made
Tangalooma what he had been when he beat Euryth-
mic.

The Canterbury Cup at w.f.a.,
was a gift to “Demosthenes’ best son,” as Amythas
is styled in the Ricketty Is’es. The M.L. Cup
winner, Royal Star, was second, and Gerald Stead’s
Nassau gelding Starland third. The Maoriland Oaks
was too far for Absurd’s stock, the Clareneeux —-
Judith filly Palestrina winning the mile-and a-ba’f
race from the All Black flapper Cleasanta. The
“Gee Gee” Stead Memorial Cup (Ij mile), on the
concluding day of the Canterbury Meeting, is always
considered in Maoriland to be the champion’s race.
Bobrikoff won it twice and so did Desert Gold.
Beth Gloaming and Sasanof may yet equal then-
record. From 1911 to 1916 a three-year-old was
sue essful, and again this year. Baronet George Clif-
ford’s Derby winner Winning Hit had to break
Beauford’s Australasian record for the distance to
beat that splendid gelding Amythas. The Hawk
was third. - . :
The Derby winner Lawn Mower was a
pretty short favorite for the Bananaland Cup (2m.),
but ran up to expectations. Impeyan, this year’s
Brisbane Cup winner, was well fancied, and Golden
Sunset, who won that race the year previous, was
expected to extend the Flying Machine colt. Both,
however, ran up a lane. On Saturday, the last day,
an unsuccessful aspirant for Novice honors in the
20-1 chance, Waitacre, by Linacre, licked the dual
Derby and Cup winner in the Sandgate Handicap.
Fairy Bob, again at odds on, was downed for the
second time by Tom McCarthy at w.f.a. in the
Prince of Wales Plate. The son of Fairy Gold only
beat Serazore by a neck. The champion has evi-
dently lost heart since his Sydney visit. In the
Two-year-old, Dave Brovrn got away better than on
Wednesday, w'hen he was unlucky to lose to Elpas,
by imp. Duke Humphrey.

For Australia to score 450 v. Africa on
Saturday without the help of Macartney, Armstrong,
Carter and Pellew was a creditable feat. Collins
again demonstrated the absurdity of attributing his
successes to luck —a theory on a par with the
English one that Armstrong bowls “tosh” —by hitting
up a chanceless 203. Barring Gregory (110) and
Ryder (56) no one could stay with him, which is
a tribute to the S’African bowling in its way.
Carter, the Natal left-hander, and the youthful
Marx, got all the wickets, Blanckenburg on this
occasion proving a complete failure. He is much
more effective on matting than on a dead-easy pitch
such as the Wanderers produced for the Jo’burg
game. As often happens when a side is called on
to face a big first-innings score, the home team
found the luck all against them. The loss of
Zulch, who opened with Frank, was particularly
unfortunate. He is the most reliable performer
with the bat in Africa, and McDonald fluked him
out for 4. Nourse, the other veteran, made a plucky
64, but Gregory got the champion Taylor for 47.
On the form shown to date S’Africa is little better
than a strong English county, and it would seem to
be suffering from the chief troubles of the county
teams. That is to say, war losses and the fact that
the veterans are going off and too few juniors
coming on. The dropping of 11. W. Chapman is
suggestive in the last connection. Before the Aus-
tralian team arrived this young all-rounder was
regarded as a certainty for every big game.
11. L. Collins’s 203 is the fifteenth three-figure
Test-match innings for Australia v. S’Africa, and
ranks next to Victor Trumper’s 214 not out in 1911.
G. A. Faulkner’s 204 is the highest among eight
by S’Africa; and J. B. Hobbs’s 187 is the best
among England’s 16. On the same ground Collins
knocked up 235 when the A.I.F. XI dropped into
S’Africa on the way home.
D. G. SOUTAR, the golf professional.
Dave Nourse, the handy man of the South
African Test team, w'as born at Croydon (Eng.), and
used to be a trumpeter in the West Riding Regiment.
He first showed his ability in military matches at
Pietermaritzburg, and eventually left the Army to
play for Natal. His best record was in the season
1906-7, which he finished with an average of_ 98 for
an aggregate of 589, including three centuries; he
has rattled up good reores against the Englishmen in
Britain and at home; and he was second only to
the brilliant G. A. Faulkner during the S’African
tour of Australia in 1910-11, when he totalled 1473
(average 58).
Richmond just saved an innings defeat in
Melbourne district cricket on Saturday. They
totalled 127 in the second hits ; and this and then-
previous 15 gave them a lead of 5 runs. These
were speedily knocked up by Carlton, who thus won
by 10 wickets (O’Keefe 6 for 43). ’Cote managed
to beat ’Wood by 6 on the first innings. At one
stage ’Cote had 4 for 150 in response to ’Wood’s
216, but the other six wickets failed badly, two
going for eyeglasses (L. Keating 5 for 61 and
Griffiths 3 for 35). University scored only 122 in
their first attempt against Hawthorn-East (Mc-
Naughton 7 for 41). Hawthorn-East, declaring with
3 for 92 in their second innings, gave the students
14 0 to win, and they did it with six wickets to
spare (Bailey 74). Jones, ’Roy’s new bowler, again
discovered his punch by taking 6 of Essendon for
47, which made his tally for the match 13 for 67.
’Don expired for 136 in their second term, leaving
a deficit of 131, which ’Roy wiped off with the
loss of five sticks; North, whose second figures were
3 for 39 at the commencement of hostilities on Satur-
day, batted stubbornly against Saints, and saved
an outright win by compiling 208. The seasiders,
however, were 60 to the good on the first innings.
P’ran were unable to improve on their first-innings
margin of one run on the first hit against South,
who, amassing 126 in the second innings, left the
shop suburb too little time to score the necessary
126 for an outright victory.
R. H. Campbell’s “Inter-State Cricket
Guide” will be useful to Victorians anxious to know
what their Xl’s have done to those of N.S.vV. aid
S. Aus., or have suffered at their hands, as the case
may be. Apart from “curiosities,” to which a special
section is devoted, the industrious searcher can glean
all sorts of odd information for himself. The vol-
ume shows, for example, that M. A. Noble has made
over 1500 runs against Victoria in centuries, of
which he has a dozen to his credit.
* * * *
H. E. Burton, captain of Wellington
(M.L.) XI and about the best bat in the Dominion,
went in the other day against Our Boys with the
board showing 3 for 49. He was not out 203 at
stumps-drawn. F. S. Middleton, the ex-Sydneyite,
arrived at 4 for 133, and they put on 275 before
the next wicket fell (at 408). It is a Wellington
competition record, and smashed the 1917 figures
(254) of J. S. Hiddlestone and Wagstaffe.
The Kangaroos totted up the record score
of the tour last week in licking a weak Bramley
XIII by 92 points to 7. Potter, the Bananalander,
and Spitzer Vest, were the only two to miss scoring.
The goal-hoisting of the ’Roos was deplorable, for
the Bramley ground is small enough to allow a
decent booter to lob them over from his own quarter.
Bramley occupied but 21st position on last year s
Northern Union competition table. The ’Roos’ score
doesn’t constitute an English N.U. record, for Hud-
dersfield once scored 119. points in a competition
game.
On Saturday Rochdale Hornets, one of the finest of
the Lancastrian XIII’s, crashed by 16 points (4
tries 2 goals) to 2 points (1 goal). As usual
there were no beg-pardons, and the first to go was
Mick Prentice, who was hooking for the ’Roos vice
Pearce. Johnston followed for misplacing the leather
in the downs, and then the axe descended on
Richards. A 15,000 crowd looked on.

There is no love lost between the English
and Australian League footballers: in fact, they
hate each other like poison. The memories that
rankle on both sides are of points taken rather
than points scored; of defeats administered with
the unclothed fist rather than the booted foot. The
war-cry of the Aussies is not merely a threat: it is
intended to act as an inspiration to the singers.
The Englishmen found themselves at the beginning of
the Second Test last month with hostile feeling run-
ning high, plenty of rankling memories, and no
regular vehicle for giving them expression. The
visitors quite understood what was implied, accord-
ingly, when the Poms lined up before play began
and gave a hearty rendering of “Auld Lang Syne.”

At Sydney Stadium on Saturday night
Jack Suddington, billed as “The Canadian Cave-
man” and suitably attired in a mat of fur, crawled
menacingly from his hole after the pelt of Llew
Edwards. It was evident from the first that he
missed the simple yet effective weapons of the tribe.
For three rounds Edwards made him look more like
a typewriter than a troglodyte. Once or twice
he managed to hit the elusive Englishman, but for
the most part he pawed the air like a lightweight
bear harassed by flies. And so it went on till round
11, when the Canadian wonder crawled from his
den and hit his hairless adversary so low and so
hard that Joe Wallis could not choose but crown
the squirming Edwards as the victor. Heedless of
the uproar the caveman leant balefully. against the
ropes, licking his wounds and dreaming of the good
old stone age, until reminded by a lackey that it
was 1921 and that the fight was over.
* * * *
Harry Nathan, whom eyerybody in the
Sydney sporting world knew' and liked, died unexpect-
edly in M.L. on Friday. He was 58 when the end
came, but looked about 45. He was best known on
the turf as the owner of the sensational Sydney Cup
winner Cadonia. He was a fine amateur boxer in the
lightweight class and one of the best referees in
the world. He presided at the Burns-Squires fight,
and Burns was anxious to have him for the Johnson
massacre, which Hugh D. Mclntosh eventually
handled. He had the eye of his race for a good
picture or piece of furniture, and bought boldly
where an article took his eye ; but, unlike the aver-
age Hebrew, he had no faculty for keeping the money
he made.
# » » •
Pat Mills, the English lightweight,
improved on the form he showed against Sid God-
frey by beating Dick Johnson in a 20-round go
at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night. Johnson
was favorite at 3 to 1 on, but the other lad had
a hatful of points to his credit when the gong
sounded the “cease fire.”
The eight-oared championship of Victoria,
which usually provides a close finish, was won by
two lengths by Mercantile on Saturday. A strong
ebb-tide produced a choppy surface on the 2i-
mile course of the lower Yarra, but Mercs, were
never troubled and headed the others from the first
half-mile. Albert Park and Civil Service put up
a great struggle for second place, the latter win-
ning by about two feet. 'The annual Champion
Sculls down-stream from the Footsoray Rowing
Club to the Williamstown Ferry was the other
event of the afternoon, and J. Barton (Richmond)
captured it for the third year in succession, with-
out being driven to excessive energy by C. Collyer
(Barwon) and A. Dawson (Ballarat), who struggled
home many lengths astern.

Joe Kirkwood and* Vic East met Fred
Popplewell and Carnegie Clark at Kensington (Syd-
ney) last week. The foursome was taken over-
seriously by all parties. In the morning Kirkwood
and East finished one up, and in the afternoon Clark
and Popplewell won by 2 up and 1 to play. Kirk-
wood generally played “stale,” and his driving
lacked finish. East was plucky throughout. Popple-
w T ell was brilliant in the afternoon, when his long
driving filled the opposition with despair.
Nineteen-year-old Jim McManamey, one
of the star athletes of his generation, has been
axvarded the .first General Pan scholarship at Sydney
Uni. With North Sydney High he won a sheaf of
schools’ championships, and recently took East Syd-
ney’s 160yds. and 220yds, club championships. He
is a son of Major Jim McManamey, a former Rugby
Union stalwart, who was killed at Gallipoli.

Oxford will achieve a fine all-round sports-

leave N. S. Wales. He did well for G. P. Schools
at Rugby against Sydney Uni. and United Service',
and stroked Grammar when they won the G.P.S.
eight-oar championship in 1920. This season he
played for N.S.W. against the Springboks at home

Eight deep-keelers started for the Fairfax
Cup in the S.E. rain-storm that drenehr* Sydney
on Saturday ; the course being Neutral Bay-Shark
Island-Manly buoy-Pinchgut-South Reef and back io
Neutral Bay. The fleet ran up ballooners for the
reach to the Village, where Oenone turned with a
bare minute to spare from Sunbeam, which led the
ancient Magic by a similar margin. In the punch
back to South Reef the Logan-built Bona soon began
to assert herself, and turned into the home stretch
38 secs, astern of Scotia, which had headed Sunbeam
en route. Bona, well handled by Len Patrick, won
by nearly 4min. from Rawhiti.

Pure invention. And the Devil
Smiles to see the friendly wink
That the leaders of the nation
Always readily accord
To the sin and degradation
That surround a racecourse horde!
Reckless slanders of this nature
Are so very hard to meet,
That the nation’s Legislature
Should their promulgators treat
Without sympathy or ruth. That
Might at length produce a gleam
Of discernment of the truth that
Things are never what they seem.

Xmas Gifts Chosen at c l(andom
rarely do justice to the donor.
A RANDOM shot seldom hits the mark, and a gift chosen
haphazardly rarely gives complete satisfaction. The
— specific purpose of Farmer’s Gift Store is to obviate, as
much as possible, this dissatisfaction, and to dispe
the perplexities generally associated with the selection of
Xmas gifts. The display, on the Ground and First Floors of
the George Street Building, comprises all manner of novel,
artistic, and conventional, yet, withal, practical gifts presents
tliat will not only excite the sincere admiration of the
recipient but unmistakably reflect the good taste of the donor.

Phones central 1533, 11609.
The empty balconies and gallery of the
Town Hall at the Limbless Soldiers’ benefit
concert on Armistice night seemed to shriek
a protest at the forgetfulness of those who
swore to always remember. The G.-G., who
was there with the vice-regal lady, never got
so close to the heart of Australians as he
did in his speech in the interval. Standing
there, an impressive figure, swayed by the
memory of two sons and a son-in-law sacri-
ficed in the Great Struggle, he begged Aus-
tralians, in their desire to raise everlasting
memorials to the brave dead, not to overlook
the living. In Australia we have 800 limb-
less Diggers. And God knows how many
more suffering unspeakable things from
poison gas, whose depressing effects may be
even worse.
Community singing has been shaking this
city all the \veek. The Earl is reputed to be
very musical; but a man must expect to
have to put up with something in every job.
And, anyhow, his Ex. brought the trouble on
himself by singing in the Town Hall in
chorus with a crowd of citizens, Dame
Nellie in the lead. For this_ ceremony the
Town Hall was crowded to the doors, with
people huddled like bees on the steps, listen-
ing and wondering what it was all about.
The highest note of Music Week was
reached at the Verbrugghen concerts. These
were given shelter in the Princess’s Theatre,
where, for one thing, the seats are softer.
The atmosphere of a modern theatre is so
much more luxurious and aesthetic than that
of the usual concert-hall that in it a soulful,
cultured audience is inclined to doubt if it
really turned up at a classical affair at
All, and is almost apt to fear that it has
taken a wrong turning and blown into musi-
cal comedy or something awful like that. The
Verbrugghen menus, as a matter of fact,
were, more “popular” than usual, so perhaps
cpmfQrt did taint them, after all. It was
all music with a capital M, though: the
music that satisfies, delights, stirs even the
humblest Philistine. The tenor soloing was
handled by Antonio Notoriello, who is so
Latin in his style you expect him to break
into heartrending sobs at any moment. The
oinission of footlights created a very ludi-
crous effect upon the soloists, too. The face
of the singer was completely in shadow, odd
features just catching a high-light now and
again, which gave the impression of terrific
grimaces during impassioned passages, par-
ticularly with a singer such as Antonio, who
was seldom in repose. Another soloist,
Connie Neville Johns, tall, ruddy-tressed,
classic and sweet-voiced, stood very still,
her face in shadow all the time, and the
audience was kept wondering how beautiful
she might be if she revealed herself. But
no one caught sight of so much as a nose.
There was just a graceful fluttering of green
satin, the bowing of a shining, sunny-haired
head, and she flew from the platform with
her arms full of roses.
Verbrugghen hopes to go to Tasmania at
the end of February—D.V. and L.U. per-
mitting. His idea is to steam to Tassy
direct after the Maoriland tour.
The only Melba has never been more
Frenchily graceful and dignified in dress, de-
portment and gesture than when she took
the platform at a Liedertafel meeting the
other night, and was the first woman to re-
ceive the society’s gold badge of member-
ship. Her appearance was an education in
good style. The evening outfit was mourn-
ing, with filmy drapings over the shoulders
suggestive of shades of night, and her pose,
was as admirable as her expressive side-wave
of the hand when president Jimmy Dyer
mentioned that at a Liedertafel concert
Melba had made her first public appearance
—“when she was young.” No Frenchwoman
could have put more poetry of protest into a
gesture. Melba thanked the president, and
spoke to the audience of her having, “as a
very young girl,” gratified her ambition to
appear with the Liedertafel. Her diction
was a delight, every syllable defined as when
she sings, and with the same apparent ease of
enunciation. People went away asking one
another whether any sweet-voiced girl on the
comedy stage could talk as prettily as Melba
when the spirit moves her to do her best.
She was making a great success at that gold-
badge function, and as an artist she couldn t
help uttering each word beautifully.
On the sultry last Saturday of the Ver-
brugghen Orchestra in Melbourne, the violin
girls, not to mention the harpist who doesn t
pop in until she’s wanted, looked very hot in
their black frocks. One of them supplied a
splash of color at the matinee by forgetting
to change her walking gown of peacock-blue
or thereabouts. Even that was better than
the monotony of utter darkness on men and
women, where white washine clothes ought
to have been. Now and then one got the
bright illusion of a pair of flame-colored
whiskers protruding from the cheeks ot a
male instrumentalist in the middle distance.
It was due to an auburn ’cello in the row
behind the fiddler, who was really a clean-
cheeked man with a mo. of no color at all.
One was thankful for the illusion all the
same. It relieved the gloom of the garments
and brought a gleam of redshine into the life
of the “London” Symphony. Oh, the sadness
and silliness of that Symphony !
.Dame Nellie lunched with the Countess
at Government House on Friday, when the
other guests were pianist Cahill and tenor
George Brooke. Cahill played a composi-
tion which he had dedicated to the diva.
Melba exclaimed “Fine—that’s good!” and
wrote across the manuscript copy: “I like
this very much —Nellie Melba.” It will be
a stubborn publisher who won’t be moved by
that incomparable praise. ‘The tenor was
asked to sing, and, of course, did so; and
both the Countess and the Dame promised
letters of introduction. Dame Nellie turned
his nose to Paris, and gave him most prac-
tical suggestions of how and under whom
to study.
Was it a souvenir-hunter or just a plain,
unadorned thief? When a tally was made
of the tableware after the ball at Federal
Government House in Cup week, a silver
salt-cellar, part of a set brought from England
and said to be much prized by her Ex.,
was missed. The police were called in, and
publicity followed. Reading between the lines
there was a hint that it would cost far less
if P.M.G. Wise were asked to restore the bit
of silver than if the job was done through
Gellibrand.
The “souvenir” notion accounts for a
multitude of larcenies by professedly respec-
table members of society. The other night
an outspoken. male guest remarked to the
hostess on her extensive and varied assort-
ment of table fixings. Some of the useful
“silver” articles bore the brands of fashion-
able London hotels, and the outspoken male
wondered how the dickens these goods came
on a Toorak dinner-table. “Souvenirs,
souvenirs,” said the hostess in a matter-of-
course tone of voice. They were just items
in long lists of things filched from uproarious
supper-tables and added to the feast-giver’s
bill of costs. He didn’t thrust souvenirs
into anybody’s pocket. No doubt he used
language unfit, for publication* when charged
with the price of the thefts.
At one of the numerous dance-frivols of
Race Week, the diminutive commander of
the Chilian training-boat was standing
rather lonely. A very tall man went up
and presented his pretty daughter as a part-
ner. He bent over the Chilian w-ith an
ingratiating smile and said : “She spika da
French, da Italian and some of da Spanish.”
“Ah,” murmured the Chilian, “I am so sorry
—I am very fond of speaking English.”
This is Lambert’s portrait of Thea Proc-
tor, an Australian who, after making a liame
in London with her
lit h o g raphs, re-
turned to Melbourne
last month with a
lot of characteristic
work. Like other
returned Australians,
she discovered first
the difficulty of bag-
ging a studio in this
artist-ridden town,
and then that artists
must join a long
queue to wait their
turn for dates in ex-
li ib i tion galleries.
Lit h o g raphs she
finds more attractive
than etchings. Lon-
don is only just be-
coming appreciative
of this expression of art apart from its com-
mercialr uses. In Pai’is it is different the
Parisians are less conservative and are great
experimenters in mediums. Miss Proctor
has brought with her prints by five other
lithographers who are represented in museums
and art galleries in England—in the Tate Gal-
lery, the British Museum, the Fitzwilliam
Museum at Cambridge and the South Ken-
sington Museum. She will show these along
with her own work at the Fine Art Gallery
in Exhibition-street on December 14 and for
nine days thereafter.. Her own earlier art-
training she got in Sydney with Julian Ash-
ton. /
At the dance on the Melbourne, the
Admiral-host wanted things to be pleasantly
informal; so there, were none of the old-
fashioned programmes —just a list of the
proposed dances fluttering above the musi-
cians. One little Toorak group, however,
took the matter into its own hands. It
brought its own programmes and audaciously
stood on deck and booked dances within its
snobbish circle. The reflection on the host’s
taste didn’t matter —he will be leaving very
soon.
The show at the Athenamm Hall until
Saturday next week is a collection of paint-
ings by W. M. Whitney, of Sydney, and
china decorations by Mrs. Topp. The work
of Mr. Whitney (known to many a Bulle-
tin reader as “The Surf Poet”) is mostly
land- and sea-scape. References to Sydney
Harbor appear a dozen times in the cata-
logue. Mrs. Topp’s china decoration is not
catalogued, but each article carries its own
number and sale price. T'ne lady, daughter
of Mr. Bonner, of the Crown Law Depart-
ment, is the war-widow of an Akgus man,
the late Lieut. Topp.
Talking of the tail-end of the Carnival,
Mrs. Harry Emmerton’s parlors were a blaze
of azaleas and flannel-flowers for her Steeple-
chase Sunday tea. Tenor Brooke warbled
soulfully to the accompaniment of pianist
Edward Cahill between the orange pekoe in
the billiard-room and the strawberries and
ices on the side lawn. Mrs. Emmerton was
in white draped with black, her pretty grey
locks ynfettered by any millinery effort.
Daughter Mrs. Norman Brookes was in black
satin, with side flaps of metallic lace, topped
by a transparent lace headpiece which looked
ornamental but unuseful. Tenor James Hay.
encircled by admiring groups of girl, lan-
guished among the guests in check pants
and a cut-away black coat.
To help the Alfred Hospital Auxiliary
women-folk got up a Medley Programme at
the Princess’s Theatre last week. Some of
it won the delighted roars of the gods. A
hefty damsel danced the Dying Swan, and
made her death flop so strenuous that it
almost shook the theatre. A delicate tenor,
with a ballad voice, chose tempestuous things
like the Toreador from “Carmen.” Some
’Varsity boys put on a turn which they
enjoyed hugely. Alford, ex-Mayor of St.
Kilda, acted as an auctioneer for sweets.
Amy Castles occupied a box with sister
Eileen and Dr. Finn. Eileen, in flesh pink
with bare arms and shoulders, drooped over
the box rail twirling a red rose and looking
quite Carmenish.
The Arts and Crafts, which grows
steadily, is to hold its annual exhibition on
November 21 —80. This time »it has to go
to the Town Hall to find space for its ex-
hibits.
The voice of the Homoeopathic Hospital is
the latest to be heard crying for help. The
Homoeopathic was to have passed the hat
two years ago, but stepped back because of
more clamorous charities. Next, an appeal
was being prepared a month ago ; and again
there was a postponement, this time because
of Lady Stradbroke’s Day. The organiser
is Darcy Macdougall, a returned lieutenant
—twice wounded in France and totally blind
for a period. Despite its name, the Homoeo-
pathic is really a general hospital. Presi-
dent Dr. W. K. Bouton has alone performed
thousands of operations in its theatre.
Mrs. Moyes, widow of a Westralian
grazier who went down in the war, has been
married in Brisbane to E., S. and A. bank-
manager Montague Thomas, who is leaving
Melbourne to take over a branch at Adel-
aide. So Mrs. Thomas returns to her native
city: she is a grand-daughter of John Mac-
Rae, one of the pioneer squatters of S. Aus.
Dr. Cameron and his wife gave a wedding
party to the pair after the ceremony at All
Saints’. The bride wore pale primrose
charmeuse, and hostess Mrs. Cameron wore
the palest lilac chiffons.
Miss Viola Dickson, one of Toorak’s best-
liked spinsters, has prefaced her return home
from a Cold Country trip with an announce-
ment of matrimonial plans. An admirer has
tempted her to forsake White Australia for
Darkest Africa. The bride-elect and her
moMier, who belong to the old wool-growing
Broughton clan, are two of our little group
of Society highbrows.
Jane Mander, the Maorilander, has just
perpetrated a new book with an amazing
pillar-box-red cover, and name to match. It
is called “The Passionate Puritan,” and has
made U.S.A. critics say eulogistic things.
John Lane godfathers Jane’s books.
A complimentary concert is to be given
to Violet Somerset, who is off to London
next year for further study. A brisk com-
mittee, headed by Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
has been working up the party, which will
be held in the Town Hall to-night, Novem-
ber 17.
Mrs. Boothby (May Parker, of the Hud-
dart Parkers) had a tea-party of women in-
terested in the concert to be given to Edward
Cahill and George Brooke. During the
afternoon the whole expense of the affair
was practically shouldered; and Olive Bagot
undertook the secretary work. The benefit
is billed for December 2, and the seats will
be crowded by the Very Naicest. For did
not Lady Stradbroke invite the two young
men to lunch the other day?
For the eighth time Jennie Brenan has
dived abroad looking for something new to
show jazzing sassiety. She left on the Xar-
kunda.
Norman Godby celebrated with great re-
joicings the arrival of a daughter on C aui-
tield Cup Day—the . only girl-child in the
numerous Godby families.,Norman is a nephew
of Dean Godby, but has got far afield trom
the Church —first a jockey, then a trainer,
now a trainer who runs his />wn horses.
Brother Cecil is also among the trainers.
A few presswomen blew into Hugh
Mclntosh’s Tivoli flat on Friday for tea-
talk and creamed strawberries with the
opposite-sex * impersonator Ella Shields.
Manager Percy Crawford waited to
duce the Inky Wayfarers and then fled.
Later on Hugh D. drifted in, obliged with
a piano solo and cocktails, and then l&s
soed Claude Flemming to provide a grand
finale of song.
Lloyd Powell, of the staff of the Royal
College of Music in London, is finding out
something of the musical talent-of Austra-
lians. Appointed to
conduct this year’s
examinations of the
Associated Board, his
work has a wide
field. He is now
running the rule
over musical Vic-
toria, touring far
south in Gipnsland
(a particularly good
section for voices)
and throughout the
State as far north as
Mildura. Thence he
goes to Wentworth
and the Darling
Iliver country in N.
S. Wales, and de-
scends through South
Aus. to Adelaide.
Already he has prowled round his appointed
part of Bananaland. He found the native
talent in the North to be phenomenal. Con-
sidering the difficult distances students have
to travel for tuition, they do wonders. In
places where a piano is not often seen (as
Kipling wrote, “You couldn’t pack a Broad-
wood half a mile”) he found many violins,
and some of the violinists surprised him
with their quality. Personally Powell is
a pianist of note, and Melbourne will hear
him at a recital on December 19.
The Paterson girls are returning next
month, after diverting London and the pro-
vinces with their drawings. Betty’s studies
of kindergarten society have made a hit, and
Esther’s art has been prominent in the
Bystander and other journals. One of
Betty’s commissions a while back in Don-
don was a portrait of Prime Minister
Hughes’s daughter Helen, who threatens to
become musical, and has already demanded
a violin to accompany daddy on the trumpet.
Carmen Pinschof, who is now known in
America as Madame Carmen Pascova, has
completed a series of successful recitals in
50 cities of the Big Republic. She has also
been doing well in opera. Carmen, who
married an immaculate gentleman named
Harris, whose beautiful moustache flourished
in amateur theatricals in Melbourne, has
been done in marble in the character of her
operatic namesake. Gilbert Riswold, the
Swedish sculptor who is responsible for the
bust, regards the Australian girl as an ideal
representative of Bizet’s heroine.
Cousin Adelaide adds a note: —
Agent-General Edward Lucas, accompanied by his
wife and daughter, left by the Narkunda last week
to complete his term of office, but first fed the Chief
Justice, members of the Government and various
others at lunch at the S.A. Hotel. Another passen-
ger by the same boat was clever young R. C. Robin,
winner of the Angas Engineering Scholarship—it’s
worth £2OO a year for a couple of years. Inciden-
tally, on the winner returning to S.A. within five
years he gets his travelling exes., but not otherwise.
A dance was given on board the Sydney, prior to
her departure, in return for the hospitalities. And
you know what a warship dance is.
Mrs. Harry Taylor gave an at-home at the Grand
Central last week, to enable friends to say good-bye
to daughter Roma, who leaves by the Mantua en
route for a wedding in Burmah.
D’you know we simple folk still remember Guy
Fawkes Day? Never for years and years, the re-
tailers say, had there been such a sale of fireworks
as there was in-this first week of November. There’s
no money like paper money to burn.
By cable from London word comes that the late
husband of Marie Tempest (Cosmo Charles Gordon-
Lennox) left £139,000. Adelaide, which is getting
roady to welcome Marie back with her company,
hopes that she may still have been remembered.
News comes by cable of the death of the widow of
Talbot Bruce —Talbot, who passed out some 50
years ago, was a partner of Judge Stow and
brother of Theodore, one-time Mayor of Adelaide.
His widow has lived for very many years at Clifton,
Bristol. Mrs. Bruce was a sister of the late Edwin
Smith’s first wife.
Died last week, after a long illness, G. W. Ford-
ham, at the age of 68; he never got over the death
of his wife three years ago, following on the loss of
two of their young sons at the war. In his youth he
was in the office of late Chief Justice Way, but later
took to business and bowls.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
HOleproof
Hosiery
It is three years since that first wonder-
ful Armistice Day when the nation went
wild with delight over the prospect of peace
and having our soldiers back with us. There
were not going to be any harrowing after-
war problems for them. The best medical
care, the pick of the land and work in
plenty were to be the magic carpet that
was to whisk them into the Realms of
Plenty. But the wells of the nation’s heart
seem to have dried in the interim; and at
last, when soldier unemployment had grown
to a disgrace, a Warriors’ Day campaign
was started, and on last Friday, the third
anniversary day, the city was put to the
collection-box test. The sum total of grati-
tude at 11 o’clock that night was well under
£5OOO. Of course the weather was blamed.
But the futility of a begging campaign to
shoulder a national responsibility was
proved. Rending the pall of the two
minutes’ silence in Martin-place a cock’s
clarion call came like the last trump ; and
one remembered the saying of that other
Redeemer, “Before the cock crows twice
thou shalt deny me thrice.”
Centralisation isn’t a good thing. Martin-
place was made the hub of the day, and
with its congestion of stalls, traders and
sightseers, the mere spender had to just
about fight her way to the stalls. Dame
Alice Chisholm presided over an Egyptian
market scene, cleverly worked up as to
detail; and as she sold and trafficked,
dressed in her old Kantara canteen costume,
one remembered her computation of the
quantities of eggs cooked in that canteen
every day. “Of course,” she explained, “we
never gave a man less than six eggs,” and
then in hasty defence of her beloved boys—
“but the Gyppo hens lay such small eggs!”
“Heeltaps and scrum” was the description
given by the bright girl of the Armistice
dance at the Wentworth on Friday night.
Furlough House being the beneficiary, Syd-
ney’s Best turned out in force, and .so did
those kind-hearted who never fail to come up
to scratch when a soldier cause is in need.
The cafe bloomed with artificial poppies,
and red carnations and roses languished on
a million or so dinner-tables. The crowd
was X. 0.5., and the dancing was mostly
shuffle and dodge even when the dancers
were split- in two like a seidlitz-powder, the
left-hand siders going first, and the right-
handers heatedly following. What the
floor of the Wentworth thought about it
wasn’t overheard, and probably was distinctly
unprintable. The committee, of course, was
radiant (most of the women aren’t dancers).
Head-liners Mrs. Cooper Day. Mrs. Spencer
Brunton and the Fuller lady, in their black
robing, were as impressive as the duchesses
in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. Secre-
taries, Mrs. Herbert Ross and Mrs. Fenner
were others in sable hues; but surgeon Mait-
land’s wife, who was treasurer, was a break-
away in an exquisite blue-and-silver frock
that might have been a bit of a summer
night; the slender Pitt Rivers lady favored
soft black satin, and Juady Loughborough
was like a splash of yellow ochre in the
throng. The tall Layton pair represented
civic interests; Prince Obolenski added his
good looks; the E. J. Watts; tall Mrs. Fran-
cis, in pastel-toned dressing ; Mrs. Nelson, in
blue and gold; and Captain and Mrs. Dal-
rymple (she was a daughter of Judge Moule,
and they jazzed like professionals and won
the competition), were a handful scattered
among the perspiring throng.
His Ex., family and entourage go to
Sutton Forest on December ID. Private-
secretary Major Egerton will take Miss
Farran’s farm-house at Moss Vale for the
period of the vice-regal pilgrimage.
The vice-regal Weigalls, who are visiting
the Macarthur Onslows at Menangle, were
among the week’s visitors to the Wentworth.
With them were the Butt-Rumford couple;
Clara, very tall and majestic in Hellenic
dr apings of black georgette and ropes of
pearls, danced her slippers through, but failed
to find a jazz-steerer of her own height. One
slender partner listened to the tall lady’s
words with such attention of eye as well as
ear that he must have developed something
like a crick in the neck.
The Town Hall has been murmurous with
homing bees this past week; and even a
gilt-edged butterfly has occasionally found
a rather bewildered way among the house-
hold appliances, the demonstrations of soap-
making, fruit-bottling, fireless cookery and
the baking of eggless cake. In other
words, the Girls’ Realm Guild is back to
old pre-war form in its Household Manage-
ment Exhibition. Midway through last
week the Cullen lady, this time in French
grey, lifted the cover from the meat-dish,
so to speak, and thrust the joint of life’s
little dinner-party before the serious dweller
in cot or flatlet; and the economic Ruth
Beale talked the methods of Canada and
Yankeeland to help women solve the pro-
blems of domestic science. (And yet, and
yet—this is strictly in parentheses —America
is the home of indigestion cures and the
dyspeptic’s chewing-gum.) Grace Burrows,
Dr. Mary Booth and Miss Brace busied
themselves in the movement; and the
Housewives’ Association and the Junior Red
Cross rallied to a brisk fire of inquiries.
There are charming embroideries, and just as
you go in the door is a little sunbaked man
in rough tweeds who will L>lk electroculture
to you in the most convincing way. lie tells
you of seeds being ansemic and run down,
and how the little batteries on his table will
tone them up and revivify them. You should
just .see what a toned-pn radish seed can
do. This letter-writer for tl • first time in
her life guessed what the enterprising Jack
had been up to with his bean.
The lienwick Hospital babies’ new home
at Summer Hill was christened with tea
early last week, and Dame Margaret, newly
returned from the Cup, dashed up to be om-
cial godmother. Within the big house set
in wide gardens Young Australia chortled
and cooed, and entered a protest against this
world of ours, while grown-up Australia, in
the person of Mr. Cooper, talked about the
financial state of the Benevolent Society.
The Bulletin’s old friend Maggie
Thwaites was the heroine of the fete at the
Ryde Home for Incurables on Saturday.
Maggie, who organises this yearly money-
spinner, does all the work from her bed or
invalid chair. Last year the fete netted
£650: this year the rain fell all day long, and
many friends must have been prevented from
spending in person the money they had set
aside. But no doubt the postman will be
kept busy delivering registered letters all
the week. The wet weather didn’t keep the
vice-regal Davidsons and Daphne and Diana
away. Sir Walter wove flowery chaplets
for Maggie and the good fairy of the Home,
Miss Margaret Harris; and Dame Mar-
garet handed the overwhelmed organiser
a posy of real blooms that perhaps kindly
Fred Searl had more to do with than he
pretended. The stalls were arranged in-
doors and on the wide porch, and trade was
brisk. The Home is under the sway of
surely the most sympathetic matron in the
world; and it is little wonder that the
patients yearly blossom into tlxis exhibition
of rare embroideries and lace work. Nor
is the handwork of the men patients to be
overlooked.
“Vandorian” sends this from London :
The handsome face with the wistful dark eyes
belongs to a gifted Australian —Bessie Griffiths, ’cel-
list and singer. She was the toddler of the Griffiths
trio, which years ago left Sydney under the maternal
wing for Europe. Matrimony snatched pianist
Beatrice (now Mrs.
Walter Swinson) and
the violinist, Muriel
(now Mrs. Fitch, wife
of a professor at Perth).
Bessie is still engaged
to her ’cello, and tours
with her own little
company in the inter-
vals of giving recitals.
Her “songs at the ’cello”
place her in the front
ran k. Temperament,
technique, a rich voice
and a charming appear-
ance—-the gods have
been very kind to her.
Fluent French and
Italian are in attend-
ance. Lately Bessie has
been playing on a
luscious-toncd old ’cello, the gift of the Princess
fairy-godmother that I told you about some months
ago. Bessie Griffiths is just back in London after
a successful tour of the South of England, followed
by a holiday on the Berkshire hills. Until January
she will be busy in London. Then she packs her
songs and precious instrument for a series of
engagements in Paris. In January her mother
leaves London for Australia by the Orvieto to see
her beloveds there.
Mrs. Colvin, who became ill on the eve
of her return to India and died last week
of an internal luemorrhage, was born Dorothy
Mail*. A sister is Mrs. Metcalfe, wife of the
senior partner in the firm of Metcalfe and
Dangar, solicitors; and a brother died of
influenza after being badly wounded in the
early part of the war. She married as a
girl ‘of 18 Darcv Osborne, divorced him, mar-
ried Theo Marks, whom she also divorced,
and was in the early thirties when the end
came. She had great charm, and her gener-
osity and good nature were astonishing. She
was a tremendous reader of every sort of
literature, good and otherwise; and a book
which she published in 1916, containing her
favorite passages from her favorite authors,
was a striking index of her odd, lovable
character. Her children, a 16-year-old -girl
and a younger boy named Peter, are
Osbornes.
11. ed recently in London handsome Oro
Bensusan, well known on Sydney concert
platforms some years ago. Long-threaten-
ing internal trouble caused a sudden col-
lapse in the end. Sister Inez, who was a
bright spot in the local profession, is now
in Cologne, running a theatrical company
which is a chief joy of the Army of Occu-
pation. Oro’s married name was Hopkins.
This good-looking young person with the
quiet eyes is acting-matron of Sydney Hospi-
tal, having unobtrusively stepped into the
big job on the death of Matron Creal. Pre-
vious to that Sister Marshall had been the
strikingly-capable assistant-matron of the
institution to which
she owes her train-
ing. Her proudest
possession is her
ILR.C.; yet her
voice is very soft
when she tells you
she left Australia in
that little hatch of
eight sisters who
sailed with the First
Expeditionary Force
in 1914. She can
hardly bear yet to
speak of the terrible
unpreparedness for
our wounded after the
Landing. Six months
she served on hospi-
tal ship—26 journevs
back and forth to
Mudros Harbor; journeys that were so full
of agony that such a small thing as personal
peril was forgotten by the devoted band of
women. . After the horrors of hospital ship
France came as .something like a relief, even
though the intrepid sister lived through Vimy
Ridge and Messines. Miss Marshall de-
clares enthusiastically for the Australian
and the Canadian nurses. “A Canadian girl
with a States training takes a lot of beating
even by Sister Australia,” she says with that
fine generosity which has made her life so
full of service.
Little Dorothy Somer was married a few
days ago in Suva, looking in her pink and
whiteness and her froth of satin and geor-
gette as pretty as a high-grade French doll.
The lucky man has the heather-mixture
name of Colin Lindsay.
Dr. Charles MacLaurin, with his wife and
only daughter Katharine —she is a brilliant
University undergraduate and a successful
pianoforte student at the Conservatorium —
is to leave shortly on a year’s tour of Eng-
land and southern Europe.
Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Burns have been
comparing Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and
other Californian beauty centres with Syd-
ney. They have their passages booked on
the Niagara for the next down-Pacific trip.
Taking the quiet twilight on the North
Shore is the widow of Jacob R. Clarke, who
with his brother arrived in Maoriland in
1848 with letters to Hori Grey, then Gover-
nor. Jacob, however, came to Sydney, and
over 70 years ago established himself in
George-street as book- and print- and music-
publisher, on the site now occupied by
Nicholson’s. Mrs. Clarke was the friend of
musical and dramatic people in the ’sixties,
as the box-plans of the theatres were kept at
the George-street shop. The venerable lady
was the personal friend of the Lyster Opera
folk, and has many reminiscences of Lucy
Escott, Georgia Uodson. Rosalie Durand,
Henry Squires, the brothers Lyster, Armes
Beaumont and other notable mus.c people
of grandpa’s day.
Ure Smith, who started the movement to
link up the Society of Australian Painter-
Etchers with societies abroad, has got in
touch with those in Chicago and California,
which will exhibit Australian prints at their
shows next year. The Chicagoans have
been looking over “Australasian Etchers”
and generously allow that they can’t rake
up anything better.
Capable Cissie Jamieson had the position
of private secretary to the Rajah and Ran-ee
of Pudukota thrust upon her some months
ago. The official part of the job lasted only
through the London season, when the cor-
respondence of the Rajah and his wife was
something to stagger anyone who had not
successfully surmounted the Alps of letter-
writing that used to be Cissie’s daily lot
when she was private secretary to the late
J. C. Williamson. The season over, Cissie,
an old friend of the Pudukota couple, has
been having a jolly time with them at
Ciifton-on-Sea; but she refused to share
their South of France sojourn, feeling that
she wanted to explore England.
A recently-formed body, Sydney Medical
Women’s Association, with Dr. Biffin as
president, Dr. Margaret Harper secretary,
and Dr. Lucy Gullett treasurer, has secured
a shack for a dispensary at Lansdowne-
street, Surry Hill's. The Association hopes
soon to open in the same salubrious quarter
a hospital for women and children, staffed
entirely by women, similar to the Queen
Victoria in Melbourne.
Tom Ityan’s widow has been in Sydney
settling up her affairs, and the flat at Coogee
will harbor her no more. Queensland and
her own relations claim her for the North-
ern State.
To the Scriabin followers Sydney news
that their idol has fallen into disfavor with
London audiences will come as a blow. At
the Orchestral Concert last week Ruby Rich
played something of his that was supposed
to be simply bursting with psycho-analysis.
It was a succession of crashing chords that
made the Philistine rather glad that Death
had intervened before the composer had dis-
covered the Mystic Chord from which per-
fume was to flow. Ruby, whose playing is
masterly and whose style is for some reason
of the old-fashioned school, supplied the
piano part in the Paderewski Fantasy, and
introduced to Australian audiences Busoni’s
“Recueillement” —Busoni’s the man who looks
like a Greek god, an Australian girl from
abroad says. The player herself, who returns
to Europe in a few weeks’ time, walked to
the piano like a young priestess approaching
the high altars —an effect heightened by the
stole-like drape at the back of her greenly-
blue dress.
All the Arts went to Mrs. George
Taylor’s party at the Australia last week, to
honor the little Countess Lalli and High
Commissioner Cook’s son and his wife.
The Countess with her handsome Italian
hunband dropped into Sydney some
weeks ago. She is a small, exquisite
creature with liquid-brown eyes and
alluring dimples, and for the big hand-
shake the other afternoon revealed soothing
glimpses of olive-green under a dove-grey
cloak, hid her soft hair under a plumed
hat, and was called for after the party by
her husband and his brother —young ladies
of high Roman families do not walk city
streets unescorted even in these modern
times.
Roland Foster’s pupils frolicked through
“The May Queen” on Saturday and Tues-
day nights on a Conservatorium stage mostly
green curtain, a pruned tree and a floral
arch. Composer Alfred Hill’s daughter
Isolda sang the part of the young lady who,
judging by Tennyson, was in permanent
need of an alarm-clock; Molyneux Phillips
courted her in the love lyrics; Robin Hood
and his Merry Men made a dashing appear-
ance, as did Ambrose Bourke and his band
of Foresters; and to Renee Lang fell the
thorny part of Royalty.
It was quite a bunch of talent that singing-
teacher Mrs. Constance Roberts presented to
an overflowing St James’s audience early in
the week. One of the soloists, Iris Scott, has
a charming mezzo-soprano; and the part-
singing was excellent. The concert over, the
pupils presented their teacher with an after-
noon-tea set.
Florrie Howard, who was assistant organ-
iser for United Charities Day, has gained
another collecting triumph. Her chocolate-
wheel on Warriors’ Day cleared £250. In
the last four weeks the indomitable young
woman has wi’ested £5OO from a cold world
for Charity.
A Brisbane postscript:—
In epite of weather that left no starch in anybody
there was a good crowd at Ascot to see J. Earwaker s
Landowner collect the Queensland Derby. Jack
Earwaker, sen., is a good sport, and the win was
most popular. Our Ex. tied the ribbon on the
blushing quadruped, and later on gave a tea-party
to the very nicest taffetas and organdies. Same night
Sir Matthew went to the Hamilton Town Hall, where
a dance in aid of St. Martin’s Hospital was being
personally conducted by Mrs. Bruche, the State Com-
mandant’s handsome wife.
Cyril White, the Government Botanist, who re-
cently married pretty school-teacher Miss Clark,
was handed a dinner service one night last week by
his comrades of the Field Naturalists’ Club. Mrs.
White is one of the very few women who have
scaled Crookneck, the most difficult of the Glass-
house Mountains.
The wedding of Pym Nicoll, second daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. J, R. Nicoll, of Willowburn, took
place in Toowoomba; Harry Kemp, of Moolabah
station, was at it too. Joyce Nicoll and Beryl
Kemp were bridesmaids. The newlyweds are ’moon-
ing in Sydney.
The Toowoomba Council is acquiring the old
home of poet Essex Evans. It is just under the
Look-out, at Picnic Point, one of the most beautiful
spots in Queensland. There is a memorial to the
poet tucked away at Webb Park, and this probably
will be removed and placed on the site of his old
home. Toowoomba is very proud of Essex Evans,
and is doing its best to keep his memory green.
Bertha Florence Ryan, of Lucknow Downs, Roma,
is flying the engagement ensign. The lucky man
is Captain E. N. Turner, of Bristol (Eng.). His
daily-bread job is Commandant of the British Solo-
mons’ constabulary. The wedding takes place almost
immediately.
A dinkum Aussie in Captain Harry Hammond has
been appointed aide to Gov. Nathan. He is the
eldest son of the late Harry Warren Hammond,
formerly of Hughenden station, and the Rev. R. B.
S. Hammond, of Sydney, is an uncle. Captain Ham-
mond served in the A.I.F. from 1914 to 1919, and
on his return took up land with his brother in the
Charleville district. His mother and sisters reside
in Sydney.

Your liver decides whether
you’re fit for anything or
good for nothing
EFFICIENCY and deficiency sound
much the same. Yet, in meaning,
they are a whole world apart. The
first comes from a liver that’s doing its
work—the second from a liver that’s
slacking.
If a man gets plenty of fresh air and
exercise; eats, masticates and digests
the right foods, his organs will perform
their functions and he will extract from
his food all the elements which are
demanded by his physical economy.
But that lucky man will be only one in
a thousand. Our climate is hard on the
liver, and we need the help of Kruschen
Salts. From its use are derived the
salines necessary for healthy life.

necessity. It is the pen which
never needs coaxing, for its reliable feed
ensures a steady flow of ink the instant
the nib touches the paper. Never a scratch,
blot or awkward break in the middle of a
word; just a smooth, easy glide that’s
what the “Swan” Pen means to YOU.

Jolm: You’ll get over it, John, when
you’ve heard her do it for the ninety-ninth time
S. r.T.. Wheat, wheat, wheat —can’t Australians
think of any other vegetable? The Lord only knows
what some Australians of dubious character will do
when they get to the hot climate they’re making for
and find that sulphur isn’t a suitable soil for a crop
of Federation or Purple Straw E. Henry: Well,
as it happens, that par didn’t go through the Mel-
bourne office Tom Mot: No reason why it should
be your last, anyway Reg F.: Poor doggerel
Sister O.: A good thing spoiled by a ;few weak
phrases the penultimate line, for instance.
A. . Thanks ; but hardly of wide enough interest.
'....Home Rule: Sestina paid 23/9/’21. .. .D.
Ennis: “Suffolk” is neat. But you’re too sparing
of rhymes for a little thing of that sort Arthur:
“Friend” a bit thin.... Machinist: Thank you. Pars
telling us what we don’t know about people we do
know are always acceptable S.L.F.: Get to your
story. You fiddle about with an overture that is
longer than the real programme 141: Whiteley
King was the Pastoralists’ Union sec. in the days
when the shearers were putting up their greatest
fight for the decent conditions they hadn’t had up
‘to then; hence anything like a makeshift Matilda,
which might reasonably be presumed to belong to a
strike-breaker, was a Whiteley King. .. .Rabbit Pie:
Hundreds of them. The swindle has been worked
for years Beresford: It’s a positive sin that we
can’t print it. .. .Lance P.: You must look up back
files. The matter was recently discussed. ... H.E.P.:
We’ve got no tarantulas in Australia .Burgh
d’E.: “Tragedy” enters the poultry competition at
the second line and goes raggedly on to say nothing.
....Bertram K.: “Summer Midnight” doesn’t make
a yarn; the translation doesn’t yell for print ; and
the verse has a hint of quality, but misses. ...K.G.
(Kimbolton) : Not enough in “Unrest”... .H.G.H.:
Vivid enough ; but a nightmare of the sort is about
the easiest thing to manufacture. .. .A.II.H.: It’s
only a sort of second-cousin to verse. .. .W.A.M.:
Not up.... Geo. P.: English commonplace of “moor-
land,” “woodland” and “purple heather”. .. .C.A.J.:
Why the extraordinary mixture of language ? If
“he wingeth,” why “he streams” in the next stanza ?
....Norman C.: The fact that it is true doesn’t
make it much of a story. ... A.E.G.: Bullock yarn
hasn’t the flick....A. Stockhorse: Poor sort....Tom
E. R.: Dreadful waste of words. .. .J. McO.: Not for
us.... A.R.N.: Wobble and bump verse of the poorest
sort. . . .Daniel F.: If you want to write verse you’ll
have to take the trouble to do it. .. .Fortunatus:
Very bad.... JIN. (Sydney): Not for us. And, by
the way, two initials are not enough for identifica-
... .T.O’B.: Here it is:—
Dawn on the rugged mountains,
Dawn on their sombre peaks,
On the lowland hills and fountains
The flush of Dawn repeats.
The cattle in the meadows
Lift their lazy heads,
To gaze upon the sunshine
That wakes the flowers from their beds.
The swallow on the hayrick
Twitters his praise to the dawn;
The magpie on the gumtree
Carols his lay to the morn.
....Edwin W.: “Hobson” doesn’t make it clear
what happened. .. .M.A.M.: Not much point. And
it’s really a horrible thing. .. .Leslie K.: Sorrowfully
crude and ungrammatical.... Sagittarius: Not well
enough done....John W.: Far too much like sand-
paper.... Paula: “The Green Harp” moves rather
heavily in a metre that ought to dance. .. .L.L.
(Burwood) : “Storm” misses, but not by a mile. . . .
W.P. (Tas.) : No; the yarn isn’t worth while at the
rate of “eight bob a day”....A.H. (Adelaide):
The mark “17J years” doesn’t remove the aged
wrinkles from its face... .C.T.C.D.: “Hobart” is too
faulty for the slight treatment... .C.C.B.: You can’t
alter the metre in every line. At any rate, you
shouldn’t. ... .Delos: To read it is like going for a
camel-ride. .. .J.B.O.: The following are its chief
faults: (1) There is no tale worth telling; (2) the
telling of what there is is not good ; (3) words are
used without any relation to their meaning....
T.A.B.: You make a very fair hash of the old com-
monplaces. .. .M.R.D.: “Dreamland” has the flavor
of a very suburban album. .. .B.P.J.: Not a pulse
in it J.A.W.: Let the beautiful thing have light
and air:—•
Fierce as a Bengal,tiger ;
Reckless as a hungry shark;
“Toughies” that jib at toil,
Round the suburbs prowl by dark.
Muscular, well-fed policemen,
Out for promotion and fame,
In the shadows lurk for crooked work,
To exposeth is their game.
Grimacing and writhing demoniacally,
Such cattle are sternly “shot in” ;
Little clemency is officially shown
To men so soaked in sin.
....Arthur N.: (1) Make up your mind about what
you intend to do. (2) Take some trouble in doing it,
....Stranger: Nice idea. Give it more work....
E.R.R.: No use.. . .Allan D.: Not enough in them. ..
C.P.T.: “Old Brummy” doesn’t manage it....
L.F.M.: Can’t find the humor. . . .A.C.M.: None of
them up... Gertrude M.: Pretty, but thin.. . Edward
B. : No good....A.B. (Redwood’s): The manner is
better than the matter... .N.T.A.: But Bramston
wasn’t really the man for whom the trap was set.
Nor was Lambert. Bill has his faults—one in parti-
cular —but the itching palm isn’t among them....
I.L.I.: “Labor Candidate” wants an hour’s work with
the spokeshave. And then it would still be wood.
....Mentor: You too obviously toil over the job.
The over-abundance of adjectives is one evidence of it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC*
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.V.O.: Crude work; prospects depend on how
the youngster responds to sound tuition.... S.P.:
Hopeless; and the sill'y joke is very ancient....
E.D.G.: No thanks... .J.W.S.: Now forward the key
to the joke D.L.M.: Some promise; try again,
but first find a joke worth illustrating.... G.H.M.:
Could not be worse... .C.Y.: Hopeless... .F.N.:
Yes, improving ; but you’ll have to do much better
before the accountant makes your acquaintance. .. .
H.D.E.: Feeble G.B.: A music-hall joke, isn’t
it?. .. .R.L.N.: Cheap punning and hopeless pencil-
lings... .A.F.: Neither is acceptable. .. .A.W.: Jokes
not worth the effort; try something else. .. .C.N.:
Gent with the puce ear and split face succumbed to
the joke L.N.McK.: Shake off the stiffness and
have another go.... W.T.H.: Childish... .Max :

For Christmas
The NEW EDISON
Every member of your family will delight in
the “NEW EDISON” as a Christmas Gift to
the home. No other article costing the same
money could give as much pleasure—for
there is no other musical instrument in the
world like it.
ghjgh
The “New Edison” is the crowning achievement
of genius—the veritable recreation of music and
song at last. That there is no difference between
its recreations and the artist’s actual perform-
ance has been proved by public tone-tests over
and over again
The story of these tests makes interesting reading
—and a booklet dealing with them will be sent
post free on request. Write now —for the sake
of a merrier Christmas.

“VALET”
Safety Razor
It is easy to shave as closely and cleanly as a barber if
you have a “barber’s edge” on your razor blade. Years
of practice have taught him how to strop his razor to
the highest pitch of keenness. With the “Valet” Auto-
Strop you can obtain such an edge every morning,
without serving an apprenticeship.
Built right into the razor is a self-stropping device which
puts the keenest edge on the blade. Half-a-dozen
strokes on its strop is all that is needed. Nothing to
unscrew—no separate stropping machine-no constant
expense for new blades.
And the “ Valet ” Auto Strop is as easy to clean as to
strop just a rinse and a wipe, without taking to pieces.
THE STANDARD SET (as illus-
trated) consists of heavily silver-plated,

The Low Lighthouse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 THINK if you’ve lived the average life,
And been fair to everyone,
’Twill matter little what you have done
Or what you have left undone
When you sail by the South-West Caxie of
Life
Where the baffling West Winds blow,
By the reefs of Douot that run far out
To a Lighthouse sadly low.
The low Lighthouse,
The low Lighthouse,
To a Lighthouse sadly low.
But ’twill matter a lot the brave, wise
words,
The words that you left unsaid—
The kind, forgiving, repentant words
That you can’t say when you’re dead ;
How many hearts, and one, they’d help
You’ll surely never know
Till your pride has died when the waves
break wide
Out there by the Lighthouse low.
The low Lighthouse,
The low Lighthouse,
By a Lighthouse sadly low.
Those poor, pale ghosts of the Wish-we-had
Shall haunt while the Home Fires burn—
The kindly letters we always should
Have answered by return.
Oh, we mean to write and we meant to
write
Till it is (or seems) too late—
There’s a mail ashore where the breakers
i roar,
Ere you pass through the South-West
Gate.
By the low Lighthouse,
The low Lighthouse,
By the Lighthouse sadly low.
There were “straight-wire” scrawls from
the good old mate
And the mate that I never met;
Perhaps in an Outback hell they wait
For a line from the “inside” yet;
And I lie and think in Hospital here
With aching limbs and brow
How she begged for a sign, if only a lipp—
And I wish I could write it now.
Near the low Lighthouse,
The low Lighthouse,
Down here near the Lighthouse low.
No business to press, but we “lose the
address,”
Or pleasure—-and then we forget
Till a dark day of rain finds us searching in
vain
For his or for her address. Yet
I’m back from death and I feel the breath
Of a glorious East Wind blow,
And I’ll do my bit to make up for it
When we’ve weathered the Lighthouse
low.

The low Lighthouse,
When I’ve rounded the Lighthouse low 7 .

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
KO FUNG sat on an old box and
brooded.
He was a very yellow man was Ko
Fling, and had all the usual world-ignoring,
immovable, stoic calm of his kind; his long
stillness might have meant nothing, his ex-
pressionless face certainly told nothing, and
his slit eyes could not show the faraway
intensity of his thoughts by narrowing any
more. But Ko Fung was brooding; he was
miserable and the world was a bad world
and his thoughts were black.
Of course, he could hardly blame any but
himself and the chance gods for the loss of
his little hoard on the devilish cards some
nights before. But then, you see, all that
he had was not enough to bring him within
reasonable distance of what only he lived
for, and schemed and prayed for, and his
impatience with the slow years and his in-
born, racial love of a gamble had driven him
to the sudden high stakes that might have
brought his long-lived dream to immediate
reality, but, instead, had banished it to
almost impossible distance again.
That was bad; but Ko Fung had tasted a
worse experience. A year before, his
fortune that was all but sufficient had been
raped from his jealous guard by the thieving
mate of a tramp that he had shipped on at
Singapore in the long business of working
his passage home. That time his incoherent
accusations had caused him to be badly
beaten, and he had crawled painfully ashore
and started off again on the long quest.
And once before that he had slowly worked
to the coveted end and held heaven all but
in his grasp. That time the sudden mon-
soon had seen to the drowning of his hopes,
together with a couple of hundred coolies.
And now he was back at the beginning of
the Tantalus-trail. Truly Ko Fung felt that
there was something wrong with the scheme
of things and began to lose hope.
For it was now four years since he had
started out to win the wealth that would
make possible of realisation the love dream
that had driven him, four weary years
since he had said good-bye to peerless
little Pale Moon of the Morning, and her
black, flower-crowned head had drooped as
she waved him away with the sure knowledge
that she would watch and watch for him. It
was not much that Ko Fung wanted, but
that little had been hard in the getting and
so easy in the losing. And the world and
all seemed leagued to thwart him, and his
starved desires gnawed him, so that his soul
was become an ugly thing that snt in sullen
blackness, brooding, always brooding.
A big, clumsy figure shuffled into the line
of his set gaze, and the little eyes of Ko Fung
idly followed it as it shifted about, rattling
the pans that stood ready for the long iron
bars laid across the open cook-fire. This
was Amat, the Malay, who was chief assist-
ant and off-sider in the cooking business.
His fumbling turned the thoughts of Ivo Fung
to a path that they had followed more and
more frequently for the last few days, a for-
bidden path that yet fascinated him with its
sinister visions; for Ivo Fung was a yellow
man with certain principles and self-com-
mandments that he had always steadfastly
clung to, and at least two of these seemed
in serious danger of being jettisoned if he
heeded the visions.
And the one had to do with the killing of
a man and the other with the stealing of that
man’s goods.
After all, his own goods, which had meant
so much more to him than all the rest of
wealth to the rest of the world, had been
cruelly torn from him by a white man, even
if he were only the drunken mate of a filthy
little tramp; and it had been a white man’s
boat that had buried his hopes in the sea.
Thus, if this white man, the plantation mana-
ger, were to be sacrificed on the altar of his
dreams and to form the means of restoring
to him that wffiich was his by right and
was lost to him only by white villainy, surely
it would be fit and proper. So the soul of
Ivo Fung labored in specious argument with
itself.
But, though he could sufficiently haze his
principles to permit of his taking what he
assured himself was his own, it was the idea
of killing that always stopped him. He
could not make a murderer.
In this, though, the conscience of Ko knew
some nice distinctions. If, for instance,
this man had blundered blindly past, making
a sure but unknowing way to a waiting death
from which one word would save him, Ko
Fung would have felt in no manner bound to
say that word. Indeed, his breath would
have stopped coming and his heart beating
for fear they whispered an involuntary warn-
ing. Bather a curious code had Ko Fung.
It was in no way the difficulty or danger
of the task that stayed him. The sight of
Amat handling the pots of food had reminded
him of the ridiculous ease of it all; he had
a quite sufficient knowledge of accessible
poisons, and, apart from them, he had always
had a sneaking liking and respect for the
time-honored powdered-glass process; and,
after that —well, the key of the safe was easy
to get, and the key of the safe was the key
of Heaven.
Sullenly Ko Fung thought and thought,
and sadly Ko Fung admitted to himself that
he was not a murderer.
He rose to inspect the big pot that Amat
was just setting on the lire. As the Malay
let it go and straightened, it slipped on the
greasy bar, and the darting hand of Ko Fung
was but barely quick enough to save it. He
settled it steadily in place and then stormily
abused the other, whose right hand had imi-
tated the darting action of his own, the
clumsy list almost dashing the pot from his
grasp at the very moment of rescue. In
the middle of his angry cackle he was sud-
denly silent, and a particularly weighty curse
seemed to hang in the air; for it flashed
on him that at the moment of slipping the
eyes of the Malay had been turned to him
and, therefore, somewhat away from the pot.
And yet the clumsy, grabbing hand had been
almost as rapidly active as his own.
With half-dropped jaw and curious eyes
the Chinaman looked at the Malay for a
silent minute; then he returned to the box
near the door, his searching gaze following
every action. For a long time he sat there
like a world-old Buddha, the blank, yellow
face in which,only the eyes lived ever turned
towards the other. Then he rose quietly
and quietly moved across the floor to the
side of the big Amat, who Stood looking
dreamily at the fire.
Suddenly the hand of Ko Fung darted out
past the Malay straight at the iron bar that
glowed red over the leaping flames. Right
to the point of grasping the hot metal went
the yellow hand, and within half an inch
of it was as quickly withdrawn. Almost
simultaneously Amat copied the movement,
brown hand flashing after yellow; but the
grasping hand of Amat actually closed on
the red-hot bar, and there was the nasty
smell of burning man and the air throbbed
with the shrieks and wails of the Malay.
Ko Fung turned away with a look on his
impassive face of legitimate curiosity well
.satisfied, and it was quite a happy, self-
pleased-looking yellow Buddha that sat on
the old box and gazed in contemplative
fashion at a big, brown man who danced
wildly about the room.
The suspicion that this was something
that Ko Fung knew and had seen
before, and not in any way a matter
of accident, now held him as a certainty.
He well remembered another unfortunate
who had long furnished all necessary amuse-
ment to the house-boys at a place which had
seen the early days of his long quest for
gold and love; the meanest boy of all had
always the power by any sudden, surprising
movement to call from this man sudden, in-
voluntary imitation of which the victim was
quite conscious, but which he was absolote’v
powerless to prevent; and Ko’s mind held
pictures of the quiet nights when for long
hours the unhappy one was kept continu-
ously at ridiculous antics to the very great
amusement of all, knowing well what he
was doing, frothing and shrieking hideous
curses at his tormentors, but hopelessly at
the mercy of the will of any of them. And
this could be continued as long as any one
of them wished, or until the nerve-raw,
body-broken wretch collapsed in a quivering,
moaning mass of helpless exhaustion; and
the long evenings were thus made to pass
very pleasantly, and the tiresome days en-
livened by many such a quaint trick as Ko
Fung had already played on Amat.
This was not a unique thing that he had
happened on, but a science-known nervous
disorder usually found in that peculiarly
nerve-ridden people of Malaya. Learned
medicine men call it Lfltah and, if the name
were unknown to him, Ko had easily diag-
nosed at sight his second case and proceeded
to deal with it on approved lines, his treat-
ment showing all the benefit of his experi-
ence with the other, and also some decidedly
original touches. For his mind was in a
state that shrieked for diversion, and the
unlucky Amat was surely a Heaven-sent in-
strument of his harmless enjoyment, for
which Ko thanked the gods.

But some days later, in one of his brood-
ing fits, he remembered that the other case
had presented further peculiarities. One
of the boys had been able so to influence the
weak will of the patient as to compel him,
most unwilling, to steal various coveted foods
from the house-larder, to the great bettering
of the conditions of life.
And then, suddenly, the light of the great
idea flashed on the crafty brain. Ko Fung
took 24 hours of silent thinking, and when
he returned to his pastime it was with a set
purpose. Hours now of every day he kept
the Malay in a painful ecstasy of unwilling,
convulsive movements, often forbearing only
when the other fell, bruised of soul and body
and almost unconscious. Indeed, so intent
did he become that the whole thing sadly
degenerated into a serious matter of business
instead of the pure pleasure that it should
have been, and, though Ko Fung greatly re-
gretted this, he rather increased the rigor of
his line of treatment. lie shared the dis-
covery with no one, but labored long and
zealously with his subject, always in the
greatest privacy.
He even formed a habit of wakefulness
which enabled him to tear the hapless, nerve-
shattered Amat out of healing sleep at early
morning hours, and the results from his
efforts at such times he found well worth
the trouble. He was a patient man and
his soul was in his work, so that his un-
wearied diligence was a thing to wonder at;
and it was not for many days that he was
satisfied that the untiring torment had
brought the Malay to a fit state for the try-
ing of the great idea.
Ko Fung was reallv working out quite
scientifically one of the most fascinating
problems of latter-day medical knowledge,
the power of suggestion, and, though he
named it no names, he was peculiarly fitted
for the task by the calm, fatalistic, patient
persistence of his race.
And this was the matter of the suggestion
—that the white-man manager should die.
And this was the manner of it—that Amat,
the Malay, should hate the white man and
that Amat should bury a big knife as far
as a big knife would go between the shoul-
ders. And this was the curious part of the
code of Ko Fung—that he most certainly
wished the white man’s death; and if the
white man died by the hand of Amat, that
would be of all good things the best, whether
the idea of the deed wefie born of gods or
devils or the amokness of a Malay, or even of
the persistent “suggestion” of a scheming
Chinee. Thus it had to be; for, alas, Ko
Fung had to own to himself that he could not
do murder.
And so it came about that Amat seemed un-
able ever to get away from two narrowed eyes
and had to listen many times, usually when
dazed after a long, tortured, convulsive ses-
sion of the other’s inducing, or after sudden
awakening in the ghostly night hours, to a
dull, monotonous voice that droned to him
over and over again of the wickedness of a
white man, of the sharpness of a big kitchen-
knife that somehow always»«eemed to be near
his hand, of the bigness and strongness of
Amat, and of how Amat hated the white man
and liow easily and pleasantly a keen blade
bit into soft liesh. And always the knife
was right in front of him or in the hand of
Ko Fung, who lovingly sharpened it or ten-
derly tested it on his thumb. And often the
two sat for long stretches, chewing betel-nut,
on the raised eating platform of the dingy
room on the nibong piles, and the hot, little
eyes held like a snake-glare the fascinated
Amat as the straining spirit of lvo Fung-
swamped him with its sinister influence.
The white man came eventually to look into
the repeated complaints of Ko about the
baked clay cooking-box. Amat stood behind
him as he bent to see the defects that the
Chinaman pointed out with a big, bright-
bladed knife that he held in his hand. Then
Ko Fung stepped back to give the knife to
the Malay.
As it passed from yellow hand to brown
and the big handle was grasped firmly in the
clumsy fist of the Malay, the darting hand
of Ko Fung feinted rapidly at the stooped
back ; the broad blade gleamed as the brown
hand of Amat flashed out. The white man
straightened suddenly, and after a long few
seconds crumpled to the floor and gurgled a
bit and coughed a little blood. And the
shrill voice of Ko Fung screamed news of
another amok Malay, and Amat stared
dazedly at the big knife sticking out of the
twitching heap on the floor, and his clumsy,
great hand scratched aimlessly at his hope-
lessly confused head.
In the jumbled disturbance and noise that
followed, a quiet, little yellow man found time
to get the key of the safe that held heaven,
and he silently gave thanks for the aid of the
gods who had been pleased to let him recover
what, after all, was but his own, without
the need of smirching his soul with murder.
Nothing now remained for Ko Fung but
to take his rejoicing way to where a moon-
faced girl waited to welcome him to paradise,
and eagerly he started. His treasure was
this time well guarded.
It is an arduous business working, as he
had to, from the Straits to China, but now
he could afford to buy a passage for the last
part of it, and it soon ended ; and when he
arrived at Hong Kong it was on a day of
spring that gleamed bright as a jewel, so
startling-clear that the houses of the city
nestling on the sudden-rising mountain
seemed actually to be leaning far out to look
into the deep, blue beauty of the harbor, ar.d
even the smoke-grimed boat that bore him
took on itself some of the surrounding glory.
But all this held no interest for him.
After four long years of scheming and soul-
fret and heartache, Ko Fung had at last come
home —nicely embalmed. Possibly the pneu-
monia might not have killed him if it had not
happened that, at a time when the ship’s sur-
geon was badly needed, he was so badly
drunk; still, that’s how it was, and the em-
balming was well done, and the genial doctor
said to the mate, “Well, that’s a tenner,
anyhow !”
But perhaps the fates that fashion the des-
tinies of yellow men knew what they were
about, after all: for very soon after Ko Fung
had set out on his search for wealth and hap-
piness, the inspiration of it all, Lttle Moon
of the Morning, had seen ht to bestow her
pale light on a certain cousin of his, who was
newly returned from Australia and was a
man of great substance.
A. M. HASEN.
A Night Raid in the Solomons.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
44 EVIL of our people, look on the
9 fatted pig that lies burning on the
J * stones ; feast on it with your eyes
and let the steam rise and be sweet in your
nostrils. Killed from the family of the
cuvled-tailed pig owned by Tai Kona, best
and fattest of all the pigs belonging to your
children! Let the hands and the arms of
your people be strong on the morrow, the
day of battle, and their eyes quick when
the arrows fly, that our shields and not our
bodies be the resting place. When the hands
of our enemies are put forth to catch us,
make our bodies even as the bodies of the
eel fish.”
The fighting men of the tribe sat around in
silence while the medicine man chanted to
the devil-devil. The fat from the smoking
sacrifice ran over the hot stones and curled
into little jets of smoke that rose on the
still air of the evening. The women and
children were absent; only the raiders and
the medicine man were allowed in s.ght of
the burnt offering. A youth just admitted
grasped a tomahawk, hafted on a long sap-
ling ; his hands trembled and his eyes were
ringed white like a crow’s. The sun dropped
behind the rugged mountain spur, and the
tropical night settled down on the tree-
sheltered village. The sacrifice was over.
Silently the men went for their weapons.
Twenty old Snider rifles were mustered, each
capable of slinging a ball big enough to rip
half a man’s side out; the others carried
killie-killies —double-edged clubs of hard-
wood—bone-barbed spears and arrows, with
the long-handled tomahawk.
The fighting men spoke little as they
looked to their weapons. Satisfied, they
walked without command after the chief.
Fifty men, in single file, they wound past
the last of the flickering village fires and
disappeared into the thick darkness of the
scrub. As a blind man, the leader kept the
narrow track by touching the scrub on either
side. Down the line the raiders touched
one another. Every rustle in the bush made
the crow-eyed youngster’s nerves quiver. The
hardened old bucks chewed harder on their
betel nut as with long strides they drew
nearer to their enemies.
In the dark of the early morning they
ranged themselves around the sleeping vil-
lage. Erai, the most cunning of the fight-
ing men, was chosen to do the kill; a short-
handled axe hung in his belt, a Snider was
grasped in his hand. Not even the quick-
hearing bush mongrels of the village barked
as he drew ever closer to the sleeping in-
mates of the huts. Pushing the blade of
his axe between the narrow door and the
post, the string whereby it was fastened
gave. Gently lie thrust the door to one
side and crawled over the two-foot door-
step. The houselire, ever lit, had burned
emners. , , ,
Along the floor Erai crawled like a snake
and dropped a few chips of ro. ten-dry wood
on the faint glowing coals. As the wood
smouldered and threatened to burst into
flame the raider’s ribs expanded as if to
give more room for the violent pounding of
his heart. He listened; nothing but tae
heavy breathing of the sleepers broke the
silence of the night. Gently he blew the
chips into a feeble flame. His eyes used to
the darkness, he saw the sleeping members
of the hut. Picking one out he grasped his
axe, measured the distance with his eye to
the victim’s neck, and then —his hand halted,
A face looked over the victim’s shoulder, a
horrible grinning countenance, the visage of
a white man and yet not like any white man
he had ever seen —a fearful, leering face,
lit by the flicker of the fire. His courage
could stand no more; letting the axe fall he
bolted for his mates, and as he dived for
the door he tripped over an outstretched leg.
A yell of fear from the sleeper pierced
the night; every man in the village was
outside in a moment. A bullet from a
raider’s Snider tore across a Mary’s breast.
She jumped feet in the air, and shrieked
like a lost soul. The villagers whizzed
arrows into the bush at random; Snider
bullets smacked on the trees or went moan-
ing through the scrub; the dull thud of a
killie-killie told of another kanaka whose
troubles were over. No man knew in the
darkness who was friend or foe. A couple
of the raiders had killed a man and were
trussing him to a pole ready for getting
away with the dawn.
With the first grey streaks in the eastern
sky the raiders took to their heels, going
by a different track from that by which
they came. The defenders waited for day-
light and followed; they picked up six of
the raiders in the first half-mile who had
bled to death or unconsciousness from tread-
ing on sharpened bamboos placed upright
in the ground and opened like a pair of
scissors—the foot slipping down to the bot-
tom of the V against the razor-like edge
of the bamboo had been cut to the bone.
Seven of the villagers had been killed and
six of the raiders.
Sutherland drifted into the bay next
morning and fired the recruiting cannon.
His sliore-boys came off in a canoe to say
there were “plenty-feller” on the beach who
wanted to sign.
On board Erai told Sutherland his tale of
the face in the hut.
“What was the name of the chief?” asked
Sutherland.
“Karri Karri,” answered Erai. “Some-
fellow man, where he stop along Queensland
be-fore, call him Dick.”
Sutherland turned to liis mate. “I gave
old Karri Karri that mask in Maryborough
in ’eighty-seven,” he said with a laugh.
Erai looked at Sutherland apprehensively.
“Master, you think that devil-devil savvy
follow man along sea?” he asked.

SOME REMINISCENCES OF AN
EVENTFUL LIFE.
I am an “only child,” born at Stour-
bridge, England, in 1852, lost both parents
in infancy, and was nurtured by a beloved
grandmother at the family home at Oaka-
moor, in the romantic and lovely Churnet
Valley, North Staffordshire. Granny taught
me the first principles of astronomy, geo-
graphy and the natural sciences: and, being
evidently born that way, long before I was
twelve I revelled in the stars, and wondered
if the Jewish God was really the God of an
endless universe. As to geography, no boy
could touch me, and granny expounded the
mysteries of the “weather glass.’ I re-
joiced in Nature, and the surroundings of
the Crystal Palace, near where I went to
school, fostered my tastes. Evolution pro-
gressed. I finished classics with the Vicar
of Launceston, romantic Cornwall compelling
a love of Nature still more. I studied
navigation at Janet Taylor’s Nautical Acad-
emy in London, and went to sea for ex-
perience. I have travelled in all the six-
divisions of the world. I founded the
Wragge Museum of Ethnoghophy, Geology,
and Natural History at Stafford, England,
and gave it to the country; worked three
meteorological stations in North Stafford-
shire, and then founded the Ben Nevis Ob-
servatory, climbing the mountain (4406 ft.)
daily in all weathers. This got me the gold
medal. I joined the South Australian survey
and became devoted to science, with physical
astronomy and meteorology as very special
lines, and started the Torrens Observatory,
Adelaide, and another on Mount Lofty, S.A.,
and later on Mount Wellington, in Tas-
mania. Then I became Government Meteor-
ologist of Queensland, and travelled in duty
all over the State. I attended international
conferences and inaugurated the observa-
tories in the French colony of New Cale-
donia, also the famous observatory on top
of Mount Kosciusko, in New South Wales.
One of my main works was the issue of
weather forecasts for all Australia. Since
1903 my beloved sciences have maintained
me and given me a home in God’s Own
Country. All that time I have lectured on
the mai'vels of the universe in England, also
all over India, Ceylon, Australia, Fiji, Ta-
hiti, Tonga and New Zealand, doing all I
could to lift mankind to a nobler concep-
tion of God and what the eternal universe
really means. Radium is one of my very
special subjects, and I have splendid speci-
mens. I have published “The Romance of
the South Seas” and other works. Ifi con-
stitution I am strong and wiry as a steel
rope, but in South Australia a few years
ago I suffered temporarily from an awful
backache and kidney trouble. Somebody
said: “Try Doan’s Pills.” I did so, with
the' result that in a little while I was cured,
and have not been bothered with the agony
since. This is a simple fact. I care not
what the medicine is composed of; suffice it
to say that it is a boon to mankind, and I
very cordially and conscientiously recom-
mend it. And now in my sixty-ninth year
I have my own weather bureau, which serves
all Australasia, and take delight in working
with iron bar, pick and shovel in my beau-
tiful tropical gardens, which I made out of
a desert in my new home at “Waiata,
Birkenhead, Auckland, N.Z., and which are
open to everybody. So much tor “Doan,’
whoever he may be, and my best thanks to
him.
ITCHING PILES CURED.
Mr. James Higgins, 650 Botany Road.
Beaconsfieid, Sydney, says: —“Some years
ago I suffered a lot from Itching Piles, the
irritation being very trying, particularly so
at night and during the hot weather. A
friend advised me to use Doan’s Ointmeqt,
and knowing how good Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills were I got a pot at once, and
it proved a blessing. After a few applica-
tions I got relief, and as I continued with
the treatment the improvement was main-
tained until finally the Piles disappeared.
Five years have elapsed since I used Doan’s
Ointment, and I have had no return of the
ailment all that time. I cannot speak too
highly of this remedy, and recommend it to
other sufferers.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all chemists
and storekeepers at 2/9 per pot.
But be sure you get DOAN’S.

The Proof
of a
Cartridge
is die Shooting
YOU cannot afford to let inferior shotgun
cartridges spoil your day’s shooting.
The best you can buy are well worth the price because you
can depend on them to do the work swiftly and accurately.
This means good priming, even loads, close patterns
and —best of all —the Remington special “wetproof’*
process. All this brings SATISFACTION at the close
of the day’s shoot.
Shotgun cartridges of different brands may look alike,
but shooting puts them to the test.

THEIR success is the natural
and logical outcome of
concentrating on the attain-
ment of an ideal—to take tyre
leadership by producing un-
equalled usefulness and value.
In Australia, as elsewhere, the
acknowledged leadership of
Vacuum Cup Tyres has found solid
expression in a permanent expan-
sion of V.C. business—based upon
the best of all foundations, an ever-
increasing degree of public confi-
dence.
ABSOLUTE SAFETY FROM
SKIDDING in Vacuum Cups has
inspired that confidence—for V.C.
Safety is an established fact,
proven by practical test in the
most slippery spot many a motor-
ist has known of. ' Unsolicited
written testimony has placed this
on record.
LONG, SATISFACTORY SER-
VICE—The Super-quality of V.C.
TYRES guarantees THAT. A
markedly slower rate of wear and
tear soon becomes manifest in
lessened cost ©f upkeep—and as a
crowning economy:-
THE PRICE OF VACUUM CUP
TYRES IS REASONABLE, based
upon a fair and honest appraise-
ment of Good Value.
