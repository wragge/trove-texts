Jap Poetry
Yone Noguchi writes with charming
naiviety of The Spirit of Japanese Poetry
in the valuable “Wisdom of the East” florin
series (Murray). The ideal Japanese poetry
is the poetry without words, and Basho was
its prophet. Noguchi thinks that the Eng-
lish poets waste too much energy in “words,
words, words.” The perfect poem wouldn’t
have any words at ail.
“I always insist that the written poems,
even when they hre said to be good, are
only the second best, as the very best poems
are left unwritten or sung in silence. It is
my opinion that the real test for poets is
how far they resist their impulse to utter-
ance, or, in another word, to the publication
of their own work—not how much they have
written, but how much they have destroyed.
To live poetry is the main thing, and the
question of the poems written or published
is indeed secondary; from such a reason I
regard our Basho Matsuwo, the 17-syllable
Hokku poet of 350 years ago, as great,
while the work credited to his wonderful
name could be printed in less than 100
pages of any ordinary size.”
It is a pathetic reflection that Basho just
missed perfection by 100 pages.
Japanese poetry is never explanatory:
the reader has everything before him on
which to let his imagination freely play.
Apparently the reader is the real poet: he
has to read into the 17-syllable Hokku or
the 31-syllable Eta poems all that the Jap-
anese poet has politely refrained from put-
ting therein. “You are the outsider of our
Japanese poems if you cannot read imme-
diately what they do not describe to you.”
Yone Noguchi’s bright suggestion for" the
revival of poetry is to destroy all poems.
“Japanese poetry is really searching for
a far more elusive effect than- the general
English poetry.” Noguchi compares the
Hokku, to a silent bell in a Buddhist temple.
It rings when a person strikes it, and what
voice the bell has depends on .the striker.
But Noguchi has forgotten that the tone of
the bell depends on its founder: the striker
can merelyx command the strength of the
note, not its place in the musical scale. He
quotes the famous Hokku, the translation
of which runs :
The old pond!
A frog leapt into —
List, the water sound! -
and adds: “It is true to say that nobody but
the author himself will ever know the real
meaning of the poem; which is the reason
I say that each reader can become a creator
of the poem by his own understanding, as if
he had written it himself.” For the Hokku
(composed of 17 syllables, 5, 7 and 5) is not
an epigram. It must not be so pointed as
that; it must be “a running, living water
of poetry where you can reflect yourself to
find your own identification. Therefore the
best Hokku poem is the least translatable in
English or perhaps in any language.” And
Noguchi regards even a dozen good Hokku
poems in one’s whole lifetime as a good .crop.
He cunningly quotes Arthur Ransome’s
'definition: “Poetry is made by a combina-
tion of kinetic with potential speech. Elim-
inate either, and. the result is no longer
poetry,” but qualifies: “The part of kinetic
speech is left quite unwritten in the Ilokku
poems, and that kinetic language in your
mind should combine its force with the
potential speech of. the poem itself, and
make the whole thing at once complete.
Indeed, it is the readers who make the
Hokkn’s imperfection a perfection of art.”
The ghoulish worship of literary remains
is the English bookman’s religion. Recently
Tite Times printed two lost sonnets of Keats,
and titled the “find” “a literary event.” The
reason why these two sonnets were never
printed is that Keats did not want th Q m
printed. Surely sufficient reason for letting
them lie. . Keats and Leigh Hunt, we learn,
were “taking their wine together,” after din-
ner, when the whim (or, more probably, the
wine) seized them to crown themselves with
laurel. On visitors arriving Hunt removed
his laurels, but Keats refused. Subse-
quently he wrote these two sonnets, in
apology_ for his conduct. But they are not
couched in the apologetic vein. Their
poetic quality would not lift them into the
usual, weekly company of The Buleetin’s
“Various Verse.” To test this question the
writer submitted them anonymously to the
fiend -who answers corresnondents with an
axe, and they got it: “The printed verses
forwarded for counsel’s -opinion might have
been written by a hivhly cultured, utterly
humorless and mentally bloodless English
gentleman-poet. There is an air of gentle,
old-maidish refinement about them, but they
are stiff and pulseless—corpse-verses, io
fact.”
The Sheep and Wool Industry of Aus-
tralasia, by Henry B. Smith (Whitcombe
and Tombs, Melb., 7s. 6d.) is an excellent
handbook for sheep-farmers and wool-
classers. Every aspect of the industry is
carefully and fully covered. There is noth-
ing from the selection of sheep, shearing,
wool-sorting, manufacturing, classing, press-
ing. scouring and selling to fellmongering
and dressing sheep that is not admirably elu-
cidated and illustrated with many useful
photographs.
The chief value of Ancient and Medieval
Art, by Margaret H. Bulley (Methuen, 55.),
lies in its illustrations. The book consists
of lessons for children upon art; the lessons
are told in story form; and a useful chart is
appended, in the shape of a cross-section map
of the ages, showing, to scale, the suggested
elevations of the great ranges of art activity
and tneir relation to the centuries. But the
illustrations are even more elucidative.
Examples are shown from paleolithic art
right down .to gothic art; and the striking
feature of these photographs is the fact that
paleolithic man drew as well as historical
man, and a great deal better than many of
the civilised nations that followed him. How-
ever, the Cubists are now slowly creeping
up.
Light Literature
When you read a novel for the story it is
because the story isn’t true. The author
who merely tells a story is telling a lie. It
is the people in the story that matter. Upon
their characterisation, not upon the plot in
which they are placed, depends the truth or
falsity of the story. Here are three light
novels: Sunrise Valley (Long, per Dymock’s
Library), a novel that will be read "for its
story; The Folk of Furry Farm (Nisbet), a
novel that will be read for the telling of its
story, and Pantomime (Hutchinson, per
Dymock’s Library), a novel that will be read
for its perfume of youth. All are lightly
entertaining.
Marion Hill, author of The Lure of Croon-
ing Water, has done it again hi Sunrise Val-
ley. The same nice girl goes down to the
same idyllic U.S. countryside, where the
same strong, domineering man resides, and
the two, in the good, old-fashioned fiction
way, quarrel their way into love. Indeed,
in the last chapter engagements become
endemic; and the author wantonly over-
brims the measure of happiness by the dis-
covery of the long-lost treasure so frequently
unearthed in fiction. But the girl is
alive, if a little tainted by the absurd U.S.
worship of maidenhood ; and the school she
comes to teach is attended by real kids. If
only the country were not so idyllic and its
inhabitants were not so uniformly beautiful
and the lure of the best-seller didn’t croon
so loud!
JX
The Irish Literary Movement doesn’t any
longer believe in fairies or blank verse. It
has begun to express itself in realistic drama
and realistic prose. The Folk of Furry Farm
is Miss Iv. F, Purdon’s first venture into
prose, and she breaks new ground. The
people of the central plain of Ireland have
hitherto found no voice in Irish literature.
The peat-.was certainly worth digging; for
The Folk of Furry Farm is almost an Irish
On Our Selection. The story is a series of
slight incidents, centring round the efforts
of Mickey Heffernan to get a wife. In
Ardenoo a girl who owns a tenth share of
two calves can always get a husband of a
sort. Not that there is no romance in
Ardenoo: the Irish peasant recognises that
marriage is too serious a thing for the in-
trusion of sentiment. The charm of the novel
resides, however, in the telling. Not only do
the peasants speak Irish of the poetical qual-
ity made famous by Synge, but the book
itself is written in this delightful language.
Iv. F. Purdon lets slip phrases of this quality
on every third page :
“It was given up to Rosy that there
wasn’t the peel of her in all Ardenoo, in the
regard of looks, and along with that she
was as shy as a filly, and as sweet as a little
bird.... 5
, “Furry Farm was terrible lonesome.
There wasn’t a neighbor within the bawl
of an ass of it....
“He could build a nest in your ear, he
was that cunnings . ..
“And the mouth on him! The same as if
it was made wicl a blow of a shovel!
“It's churns and ass-loads of money he
has with him, that he’s after bringing out
of America....
“Many and many a night Margaret would
be lying awake, and would cry a sackful,
thinking of Patsy.”....
Jt
G. B. Stern’s Pantomime is a modern
fantasy of London life. It is an allegory
of youth with its splendid dreams, its glori-
ous transformation-scene and its end in the
harlequinade with its matter-of-fact saus-
ages. Nan has the yearning dreams of love
and finds her Pierrot, and the two elope—
too late. For so often had they dreamed
and discussed their elopement that the
reality proves sordid; and each runs away
from the room they had so grandiloquently
engaged in a dreary hotel. They had played
out their pantomime: there was only the
harlequinade left. Yet the story of Nan
is delightfully done. Her acquaintances in
the histrionic academy where she passes
some futile terms are pleasantly real; and
the love-letters that she and Pierrot ex-
change are just the sort that, you
remember, you wrote —and didn’t send. You
know: “One day, Girl—one day! Last
night in bed I stretched out a hand in case
fancy had become fact....” That sort of
thing, very innocent, after all —the tragi-
comedy of young love. A book for youth
and unsophisticated middle-age.

Three interesting shilling publications,
Brisbane, Old and New; Adelaide, Old and
A ew; and Victoria, Old and New (J. Feld-
heim, Melb.) show, by means of old draw-
mgs of Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and
other Victorian cities, contrasted with
modern photographs of the same views, the
progress from the foundations of settlement
to the present day. The only objection to
the books is that they are, naturally, rather
overrun with advertisements. Next year
some enterprising publisher will doubtless
get out a similar series, showing our chief
cities before and after the war. These books
might possibly be printed in another
language.
Poems Translated from the Irish
(The two following poems, of which ver-
sions have been given by various authors,
seem to have been part of one long poem.
Lady Gregory has published a literal trans-
lation, already quoted on this page.)
DONALL OGE.
Were I to go to the west, from the west I
would come not again,
The hill that is highest I would climb, at the
cord that is toughest I would strain;
The branch I would soonest pluck is far out
of my reach in the hollow,
And the track of my lover's feet is the track
that my heart would follow.
My heart is as dark as the sloe in a crack of
the mountain gorge;
Or a burnt-out, cinder fallen at the back of
the blazing forge;
As the stain of a miry shoe on the marble
steps of a palace,
As the stain of a drowning fly in the wine of
the Holy chalice.
My heart is a cluster of nuts with every
kernel dropped,
My heart is the ice on the pond above, where
the mill has stopped;
A mournful sadness is breaking over my
running laughter
Like the mirth of a mgid at her marriage and
the heavy sorrow after.
You have taken the east from me and you
have taken the west,
You have taken the path before me and the
path that is behind;
The moon is gone from me by night and the
sun is gone by day.
Alas! I greatly dread you have stolen my
God away!
By the Well of Loneliness I sit and make my
moan;
I hear no sound in the depths below from the
fall of the dropping stone;
I see the cold, wide world, but my lad I do
not see,
Your shadow no longer lying between God
and me.
The color of the blackberry is my old lover’s
color;
Or the color of the raspberry on a bright day
of summer;
Or the color of the heathberry where the bog-
grass is rarest —
Ah! the blackest head is often on the form
that's fairest.
I heard the dog speak of you last night and
the sun gone down,
I heard the snipe calling aloud from the
marshlands brown;
It is you are the lonely bird flitting from tree
to tree —
May you, never find your mate if you find not
me!
It is time for me to leave this cruel toion
behind,
The stones are sharp in it, the very mould
unkind;
The voice of blame-is heard like the mutter-
ing of the sea —
The heavy hand of the band of men back-
biting me.
I denounce loijfe; she who gave it to him is
now all urmone;
Little he understood, you black mother's son.
That my heart is turned to stone, what mat-
tered that to you?
What were you caring for, but to get a cotv
or two?
THE GRIEF OF A GIRL’S HEART.
.. . .You promised me, hut you spoke a lie to
me,
That you would he before me at the fold of
the sheep;
I let a whistle out and three hundred shouts
for you,
But I found nothing in it hut a lamb a-bl,eat-
ing.
You promised me, a thing that was hard for
you,
A ship of gold under a mast of silver,
Twelve great towns of the world's market-
towns.
And a fine white court beside the sea ....
O Donall Oge, it were better for thee I to be
with thee,
Than a high-born, arrogant, wasteful lady;
I would milk your cows, and I would churn
for you,
And if it went hard with you, I would strike
a blow with you.
Och, ochone, it is not the hunger,
Nor want of food and drink, nor want of
sleep,
That has left me wasting and weary;
The love of a young man it is that has sick-
ened me.
Early in the morning I saw the young man
On the back of his horse going along the
road,;
He did no* move over to me nor take any
heed of me,
And on mv coming home, it, is T who tcept
my fill. ...
It was a Sunday that T gave my love to you,'
The Sunday before Easter Sunday exactly;
I myself on my knees a-reading the Passion,
My two eyes giving love to you ever after...
My little mother said/to me not io speak with
you
To-day or to-morrow or on Sunday;
It is in the bad hour she gave me that choice,
It, is “shutting the door after the theft.”
And yon passed me by, dark and late, /
And you, passed me by, and the light of the
day in it;
If you would come in yourself and see me
Never a word at all would I have with you.
From “The Poem Book of the Gael” (trans-
lations from Irish Gaelic Poetry), edited by
Eleanor Hull (Chatto and Windus, Lon-
don ).
W. Douglas Newton, the author of . a
grim study of modern war, localises his
prophecy j n Ulster, in The North Afire
(Methuen), picturing the painful conse-
quences of an Ulster rebellion suppressed by
the military. For the purposes of fiction
he plac.es a British officer and his fiancee
on opposite sides, and contrives to get a
stirring dramatic climax to his sermon. In
the end military law is proclaimed, and the
soldiers who were merely doing police duty
are enabled to clean the rebellion up by the
sternest military methods. He describes
the ruin that befalls: “The Home Rulers
aren’t the only ones ruined. As soon as
the news got about the Catholics were up
t 00.... Half the country is laid waste....
Fighting through all the cultivated tracts.
Men battling over land ready for working,
that now will never be worked this year.
In Armagh town and Portadowu they’ve
had strpet fighting, and, inevitably, the
factories have been done in. In an affair
like this the first thing the linen-hand thinks
of is the factory he loathes. He either
throws a bomb into it or goes over it
thoroughly with kerosene and a torch. If
it’s owned by Orangemen, one of the
Catholic hands does the job. If the boss is
a Nationalist, all the Protestant hands com-
bine to see the work through. The North
is reaping a handsome dividend for its busi-
ness-like record of determined underpaying
. . . .Ulster was already starving.”
England is a curious place: there a man’s
private life may ruin his public one. There,
as elsewhere, the seventh commandment may
be smashed with impunity—even the
eleventh commandment, “Thou shalt not be
found out,” may be blithely dynamited—
provided the man is not a public man. He
will suffer the penalty, no doubt, but it will
be a private and personal penalty. A busi-
ness man. a professional man, a working
man, a shopkeeper, risks only his personal
concerns: his business, his profession, his
employment, his shop do not suffer with him
for his sin ; but the consequences are fatal
to politicians, vicars and even dramatists.
The vicar periodically vanishes; the certifi-
cate of the captain of the Irish Home Rule
vessel is confiscated by the orders of the
Nonconformist Conscience Board: Wilde’s
name is removed from his plays. The point
strongly stressed by Katherine O’Shea, who'
became Parnell’s wife after the divorce, in
her two volumes of Charles Stewart Par-
nell: Tits Love Story and Political Life
(Cassell, per Dymock’s Library, Sydney), is
that' the eleventh commandment is much
more drastic than the seventh. Gladstone
knew that Parnell was Mrs. O’Shea’s lover
—and used her as a convenient means of
private communication with the Irish leader
for some years; but as sdon as the facts
became public the Grand Old Spider held up
his claws in horror; and for political rea-
sons —which are usually pretty low-down
reasons —seized the opportunity of getting
rid of his troublesome antagonist. This
fact emerges nlainly from this book. The
personal and intimate view that Mrs. Par-
nell gives of the great man is highly inter-
esting ; his love-letters are freely
quoted: but all love-letters are the same
love-letters, except those written for publi-
cation ; and we learn, if we wish, all about
his hobbies, his dog and his horse, and the
methods by which he communicated with
Mrs. O’Shea without her husband’s know-
ledge.

when reliability and easy cycling will
mean a great deal more to you than the
saving of a few shillings at buying time.

MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to

Liver or Kidney Disease.

table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-

restores to health the entire nervous system,

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dead-End.
It seems the same old world, and yet it’s
not,
For. out of Europe, leaps the news white-
hot—
We are at last right in the melting pot!
Ages ago, I slowly learnt at school
Of how men fought with naked steel. One
fool
Armed with a gun could Mars’ own ardor
cool.
1 read of “great” wars, as they gauged them
in
Those old days, when a mild and smoky din
Disgraced a field or so and spoiled a skin.
But this dispute makes mighty Ca sar’s ghost
Arise and stare, while dead Napoleon’s host
Of battle spectres mock his proudest boast.
But yesterday—like many millions more—
I had my plans to make a little store.
Lost are my dreams in hurricanes of war.
Let’s burn the books and watch the flames
arise!
What shall it profit us to dim our eyes
With puny tales of Caesar ’neatli these skies?
The old world’s past is graven deep in stone.
Why should we think in blood and flesh and
bone?
Man lives to die and give Earth back her
own.
Behind us to the limit of our sight
The dead years stretch away into the night.
Before us flames the furnace of our might.
And to this end we built and toiled and won !
Behold our splendid savagery outdone!
Man's servant, god and master is—the Gun !

THE LAD AT THE FIRE.
Fat Fauntleroy.
When Gwendolyn was cold and proud
I used to steal apart,
And, book in hand, forsake the crowd
To read “The Riven Heart.”
I cannot tell how sadly throbbed
Each haunting minor line —
How charmingly the poet sobbed
In misery divine.
Ah ! never, never have I read
Such stanzas, or such free
Poetic raptures! Have 1 said
The price was one-and-three ?
But, seated in a railway-car,
I saw a stoutish man;
He smoked a large and rank cigar—
His boots were new, and tan.
His hands were lumps of formless flesh ;
His clothes were loud and spruce ;
From ardent draughts his breath was fresh ;
His jowl inclined to puce.
But still, it is not safe to judge
By outward form alone :
I hoped the stranger would not grudge
A sympathetic groan.
And so I read (the author’s name
Was Fauntleroy de Vere).
I read aloud, and hoped to claim
A kind, attentive ear.
I read a simple little thing
In Fauntleroy’s best vein—-
“Love Unrequited in the Spring—
A Melody of Pain.”
“Is it not wonderful,” I asked
“For man to write like that?’
The stranger in the sunlight basked,
And somnolently spat.
“How tortured was his turgid heart!
How poignant were his woes !”
The stranger wakened, with a start—
A fly was on his nose.
“Tell me,” said he, “How is the grub
Where we pull up for lunch?
Is it a fully-licensed pub,
Or some damn wowser hunch?”
How could I talk with one so rude,
So dead to lovely grief?
His mind ungarmented, and rude
Except for thoughts of beef!
The train was slowing up.; it stopped:
A face smeared o’er with joy
In at my fat friend’s window popped—
“ ’Vllo there, Fauntleroy!”
That fatted criminal did not
Deny it! No indeed !
He hailed with joy the other blot
And with him went to feed.
I dashed his poems on the seat
And fled that curs&d train ;
And I would rather burn than meet
Fat Fauntleroy again.

The Suicide.
They found him on a harbor beach, washed
up at early morn.
They gathered round him in a ring,
This ghastly, sodden, sightless thing,
And wondered what grim tragic weight his
luckless soul had borne.
They took the body to the morgue, where on
a slab it lay.
A haggard woman came to see.
She wept upon it piteously
And claimed it as her cherished son, her one
and only stay.
A cub-reporter who had lived a strenuous
life and true,
A youth, she said, so full of pride,
Who gambled not, nor swore, nor lied.
Ah! such a son as he had been were far
between and few.
She could not even recollect one little
youthful sin.
No cause had he for wild regret.
No foolish loves, not one small debt.
She little guessed ! His heartless rag had sent
him to “East Lynne!”

THE OLD YOUNG-MAN-IN-A-HURRY.
A man who deserves a lot of sympathy ; —
which he won’t get—in the present European
upheaval is the Kaiser of Germany. He
has apparently missed the ’bus, after waiting
for the wretched old vehicle or contraption
during a reign of 26 years. He has fallen
in, and the gulf into which he has fallen
looks as if it had no bottom. Yet it must
be remembered to William’s credit that for
26 years he kept the peace. During his
reign Britain —an allegedly harmless country
—fought a long and desperate and costly
war in South Africa, and smaller wars in
other places. Italy scrapped with Turkey,
and four of the little Balkan States
scrapped with Turkey. Then the four
little Balkan States scrapped furiously
among themselves. Russia and Japan
fought out a war which, as regards
the size of the legions involved, was the
biggest affair which any European Power
had tackled for something like 14 centuries.
Since the day when a mixed army of Romans,
Visgoths, Franks and sundries turned back
the great Asiatic invasion when it was
almost in sight of Paris there had been
nothing like it. Spain had a campaign with
the United States. Portugal enjoyed a
revolution. The Scandinavian kingdom
broke in two. The north-eastern atom. of
Ulster started to raise an army with a view
to making civil war in the British Isles.
Amid all these troubles the Kaiser of Ger-
many remained peaceful. But his pose as
the War Lord of Europe, his speeches, his
military reviews, his helmet and cocked hat
and feathers and his numerous uniforms
created an impression that he was danger-
ous. There was always a feeling that lie
proposed to knock Sheol out of the uni-
verse. And the multitude of newspaper and
magazine articles which arose out of all this
pose and cocked hat possibly went to his
head. He scurried around a good deal.
At the age of 55 he was still regarded as
the #
Away back in 1877 and 1878 Russia,
aided bv Roumania, most justifiably kicked
the feet from under the Unspeakable Turk.
The result was a considerable re-
arrangement of territory, in which Russia.
Britain, Roumania, Bulgaria and Greece all
participated, either as people who gathered in
the prizes of war or as people who collected
payment for services rendered. But as a
curious side issue of the case, Austria, which
hadn’t rendered any visible services or
carried a rifle in the trouble, “occupied”
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Unspeakable
Turk hung his battered fez on a nail when all
the trouble was over, and said that his
enemies were bad, but one of his friends was
a great deal worse. Germany got nothing
qut of the confusion.
* * * *
Thjen things drifted along until Sultan
Abdul the Damned was dethroned, and the
Young Turks and the new Sultan
MohAmmed V., who had been in a sqrt of
prison for 30 years, and hadn’t even been
allowed to see the newspapers regularly,
created a shocking muddle which they called
a_ Parliament. At this juncture Turkey
hinted that Austria should put its cards
on the table, and explain whether it had a
full hand or a bob-tailed flush. If Bosnia
and Herzegovina—the “Occupied Provinces”
—were still Turkish territory, they must be
allowed to elect members to the new Parlia-
ment, and Austria would be due to clear
out. If they weren’t Turkish territory then
Austria must take its courage in both hands
and annex them as Britain annexed Cyprus.
Baron Aerentiial, the Austrian statesman
of the moment, sat up in the bed where he
was dying of kidney disease, and did the
annexation. Britain complained, but it
didn’t complain very hard. Russia, in
its capacity of protector of the Slav,
or semi-Slav races, grew really angry.
But Russia hadn’t recovered from the dis-
asters of its last war, and was hardly in a
position to make trouble on a large
scale. Germany, personified by the Young-
Man-in-a-Hurry, put on its spiked helmet
and warned Russia to back down and be
peaceful. _ Russia backed down, and made
an entry in its diary that it would get square
for the humiliation some day. Germany
made nothing out of this deal either, except
a certain amount of glory. Since the be-
ginning of the reign of Willam, the Young-
Man-in-a-llurry, Germany has never made
anything worth mentioning out of its foreign
complications.
# » * *
A little while ago certain Servians, who
had never got over the fact that Bosnia and
Herzegovina had become Austrian instead
of Servian territory, killed the heir of the
Austrian throne and his wife. Then Austria
went into a cold frenzy, and the Emperor,
who is almost the oldest inhabitant of
Europe, drifted with the tide. It was easier
to declare war on Servia than to be shot by
his own loyal subjects, so he made war. He
is a futile old person—the remains of a man
who was once really great—and the four
winds of Circumstance blew him in front of
them. Over the border the four winds
of Circumstance blew on another ruler. No
one ever accused the present Czar of posing
needlessly as a War-Lord, of issuing any
foolish ultimatum, or of wearing the spiked
helmet of military display for the mere love
of the thing. Yet Russia began to collect
its army. Public opinion wouldn’t permit
the Muscovite’s fellow-!Slav in Servia to be
trodden on without some semblance of aid.
The treading-on business was being overdone.
It is 1000 chances to one that the aged
Austrian Emperor, who is long past the days
of ambition, would have backed out of the
Servian war as soon as his dignity was satis-
fied. So many of his relatives have died by
violence that the death of two more probably
counted for less than might have been
expected. A man who came to the throne
in 1848 couldn’t have much desire to rush
into Homeric conflict in 1914. And the
Czar would almost certainly have met him
more than half-way, if nobody had inter-
vened. Unhappily somebody is always liable
to intervene.
* * * *
The case was one which called for
the services of the most brilliant and
gentlemanly liars in the diplomatic ser-
vices of Europe. But, uphappily, the Middle-
Aged Young-Man-in-a-Hurry came on the
scene. Possibly he felt that he is getting
old —for he is older than his years—and that
he has really done nothing of importance
except be in a hurry. He is the sort of
citzen who, even if he only wanted a three-
penny drink, and had all the evening before
him to buy it in, would enter the bar in such
haste that he would bruise his stomach
against the counter. For 26 years—26 peace-
ful but rather noisy years—the third German
Emperor has been the large kitten of Europe
-—a kitten being defined as an animal that
rushes at nothing and stops before it gets
there. He has frequently been a peacemaker,
but it is complained that the manner of his
benevolence is too much like that of Dickens’s
famous Mrs. Pardiggle, who insisted on
reading the Bible to an infuriated family of
brickmakers. This brilliant but ill-ballasted
monarch took up his usual attitude, and
ordered Russia to disarm. Unfortunately
for the Hurried Person there are limits
beyond which a great and courageous
nation can’t go. The Russian Govern-
ment stood firm. Probably the most
stunned person in Europe was Ger-
many’s Middle-aged Young-Man-in-a-Hurry
when his bluff was called at last. He
couldn’t back out except by making himself
the laughing stock of Germany and Europe
in general, and giving up his pose as a War
Lord for the rest of his days. So he declared
war. and probably wished he had not been so
fresh—or else he wished that he was dead.
* * * #
The theory that Germany blundered into
the Great Trouble against its Sovereign’s
intention —that it was a mere matter of pride
and pomp and froth and bubble and cocked
hat and feathers and misadventure—is based
on the miserable lack of preparation. To
begin with, it hadn’t even been decided that
Austria should declare war in due form, con-
sequently Europe saw the amazing spectacle
of Germany declaring war against Russia on
behalf of Austria, long before Austria had
made any formal declaration on behalf of
itself. This was a strange and wonderful
business. Further, no attempt had been made
in the scuffle to find out whether Italy would
stand by its partners in the Triple Alliance
or would take the back track for home. Yet
the aid of the great Italian fleet was a
matter of supreme importance. As it hap-
pened, Italy took the back track for home,
and, as a disreputable warrior said in
Scott’s “Ivanhoe,” “a great arm was lopped
off the enterprise”—or words to that effect.
Roumania, which is a small Power but a
very strong one for its size, is supposed to be
in the German-Austrian-Italian alliancp, but
not having been consulted about matters, it
also lies low and plays its own game. Swe-
den might have been roped in by reason of its
long-standing dislike to Russia, and its help
would have been invaluable in the Baltic, but
no one had time to send a post-card
to Sweden or ring it ’ up. on. the
long distance ’ arrangement. Amid _ a
haze of doubt and a great dust of recrimina-
tion Germany committed itself to a struggle
in a cause that wasn’t its own. It went to
battle with the strongest and least" accessible
of its possible enemies, and the one from
whom it had thp smallest possible hope qf
extracting a dividend either in land or
money.
* * * *
The situation expounded the difference
between a professional War Lorjl and an
amateur one. Bismarck would have died
of old age and cold feet at the telephone
rather than plunge into strife without first
locating all his possible friends and all his
reliable enemies. When he dropped on Den-
mark in 1864 he had secured Austria as an
ally, and had made reasonably certain that
Denmark had no possible allies. Before lie
turned dog on Austria in 1866 he had
secured Italy as an ally, and collected fairly
solid assurances that neither Britain. Russia
nor the decayed French Emperor would make
serious trouble. When he fell on France in
1870 he had got all the smaller German
States on his side, had secured Russia as a
guardian in the rear, and had assured him-
self, so far as it could be done, of the
neutrality of the other great Powers. The
man who made the present German Empire
was an animal of large discourse, looking
before and after.
* * * *
Apparently, when the war with Russia
really started, through a lamentable mis-
conception of the possibilities of bluff, the
Elderly Young-Man-in-a-Hurry lost his head.
It is hard to believe that there was any
immediate need to provoke a quarrel with
France. The trouble might be inevitable,
but at a time of great possibilities it seemed
absurd to rush at the French £?4±resses
instead of letting the French rush at the
German fortresses. Also the demented policy
by which Belgium and Britain were dragged
into the complication was a case of looking
for accumulated disaster. But there is a
theory that fortune belongs to the person
who strikes hard and strikes first —which is
reasonable, provided he doesn’t strike any-
body twice his size and doesn’t strike too
many people at once. No man should hit 12
policemen at the same moment. During 26
years the Kaiser had posed—probably with
an honest belief in himself —-as the man of
action, the arbiter, the dictator, the keeper
of the peace, the prompt, decisive soldier
and a lot of other things. He was the influ-
ence who made the fuss in Morocco; the
sovereign who created the German navy;
the potentate who squashed the war that
threatened to convulse Europe in 1909; the
magnificent figure who went on a visit to
Jerusalem and had a section of the wall
torn down to make room for his entry ; the
person who cabled to Paul Kruger —for
which attention plain old Paul had no
reason to feel grateful. Yet when he was
called upon to live up to his pose, the result
almost duplicated the record of Napoleon
111. in 1870. Then it was France which
stumbled into ruin without making sure
that its friends were ready.
* * * *
This writer is sincerely sorry for the
poor, misfortunate Old Young-Man-in-a-
Hurry. He has been, all his life, a well-
meaning mass of incongruous ambitions and
scattered ideals. The war is probably far
from ended; still it is possible that the
empire which was built on Napoleon’s in-
capacity may fall through exactly the same
brand of incapacity. William bids fair to
undo Bismarck’s great work. A prophet
who once hung out in Germany foretold that
the new Empire would go to pieces about
this time, and a prophet of that sort is a
depressing creature to have on the premises.
Nobody likes either his company or his prog-
nostications. Meanwhile it is up to Australia
to remember that, even if Britain’s enemies
are scattered and Sydney isn’t shelled, and
Melbourne isn’t burned, and the Northern
Territory isn’t annexed, the matter is one of
pure luck. It may be the amazing fortune
of the moment to have for our enemy an
incompetent Old Young-Man-in-a-Hurry.
But no one can feel certain that that sort of
fortune will last.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Rotten Gun.
Party Government got the advertisement of
its life, so far as Australia was concerned,
when old Europe blazed up and almost
every country of any importance save Spain
and Italy went to war. It was decided to
practically suspend the miserable old thing
so far as N.S.W. State politics were con-
cerned. The object was to be temporarily
hanged by the neck till it was dead. Oppo-
sition-leader Wade withdrew his opposition
and was promptly offered by Premier Hol-
man a seat in the Cabinet. Wade’s action
was applauded. Holman’s action was
applauded. Sydney could hardly hear itself
eat its soup for aDplause. The press urged
other States and the Commonwealth to
follow the good example, and the Federal
Labor party promptly held out the gum-
tree of peace by withdrawing the candidate
it had put up against Mine Minister Cook
in his own electorate. Just about here a
number of people began to marvel greatly
in their innards. No one proposes to suspend
the army, or the navy, or the Church, or the
police, or the medical profession because war
has started. The education system may oe
hung up, but that sort of thing is done with
reluctance, and only when affairs become
desperate. The railways are not stopped ;
rather the staff is urged to special exertions.
And if Party Government is good for the
country it might be supposed that it would
also be urged to extra fury at a time when
the country is in need of all the good it can
get. Yet, curiously enough, large strenuous
party newsnapers rise up on the first day
of real strife, and demand that their fetich
should leave off. They are of opinion that
their political deity should, in the interests
of the nation, of the flag, of the Public
Debt and of posterity, be hurried to the
ash-barrel. They want the nearest approach
they can fret, at short notice, and under the
existing clumsy conditions, to the Elective.
Ministry. When it is proposed at a crisis
that Gregory Wade, the elected leader of
nearly half the N.S.W. Assembly, and
Holman, thi elected leader of rather morq
than half the same body,should come
together ? the scouts of strenuous party
papers split the welkin and wake the morn-
ing kookaburra before its time. Now, if
ike ficketty, racketty party machine is thus
distrusted when the country is in real
danger it fs difficult to imagine that it can
jiip of much account at any other time.’ Tiie
gun that has to be thrown away, for the
sake of the community, as soon as war com-
mences doesn’t jook a great deal of a gun.
Why not’ try the Elective Ministry idea in
the piping times of peace, and put it on a
steady and business-like basis?

Party Tactics versus Public Duty.
The Sydney Telegraph was too impartial
altogether last wpek, With naif disregard
of the lifelong habits of our party politicians
it urged repeatedly that Joseph Cook should
relinquish, “in the name of national decency
and national safety” what no one recog-
nises more clearly than he does to be the
chance of a lifetime. The paper put it this
way (6/8/’l4) : —-
Now that the Empire is involved in war it becomes
the plain duty of Federal political leaders to take
such measures as may be necessary to postpone the
elections. If that was advisable before, in view of
the danger of war, it is imperative when the conflict
is actually raging. It would be worse than ridiculous
to go on with the elections in such circumstances—it
would be politically indecent and. utterly wrong.
Several suggestions for obviating an elec-
tioneering tight were put forward, of which
the most practicable was that all opposition
to sitting members should be withdrawn,
leaving the two Federal houses to be re-
elected on the old basis. The Laborit.es
have officially announced their sympathy
with the Telegraph’s view. In fact they
have already voluntarily withdrawn their
candidate in Parramatta “in order to give
the Prime Minister the utmost time to
attend to his duties.” That is how the
Laborites put it. It may be mentioned, in
passing, that the renunciation involves no
vast sacrifice, inasmuch as a Labor candi-
date would not have a dog’s chance of
winning in Parramatta, under any circum-
stances. Cook, on the other hand, has
greeted the Telegraph’s proposal with
scorn. He would require to be a politician
of the rare Deakin breed —a thing which
he emphatically is not —to feel or act differ-
ently. A fortnight ago his chances of
bettering his old position looked hopeless.
The country is weary of Liberalism. The
party lacks the courage of its Toryism, and
so fails to enthuse the reactionaries; and
its radicalism has a chronic habit of being
a couple of years behind the times, as a
result of which it gets no support from the
Progressives. It stands obstinately for the
Machine, for the Party system, for an un-
altered Constitution, and all the other
anachronisms from which modern thought
is turning with impatience. Something
verging on the miraculous was required, as
things were a couple of weeks ago, to give
Federal Liberalism a chance of majorities in
both Houses. The miracle has happened. The
great war has begun. Tremendous things
are going to occur in Europe in the coming
few weeks. As one result the Party row m
Australia will seem absurdly beside the
point. Electioneering organisations will fall
to pieces. Candidates will cease the farce
of candidating in a country which is threat-
ened with national extinction. The working
closes will be either too harassed by the
financial straits in which they will find
themselves, or too occupied at their tradi-
tional business of defending the menaced
property of others to vote their party ticket
with anything like solidity. On the other
hand the conservative section —the people
with a little money, or a lot of it, and a
natural bias in the direction of voting “safe”
—are likely to cleave pretty strenously to
Cook, not only as a Liberal, but as the man
already in charge. The war fever has not
reached Australia yet. It is still possible
to speak of Germans as fellow human beings
without arousing the frenzy of our tap-room
loyalists. But unless the Kaiser’s forces go
down all along the line it is to be feared
that this period of philosophic tolerance will
swiftly pass. The blatant political adven-
turer who is accustomed to make a business
of what he calls patriotism will then come
into his own. By virtue of that perfectly
insane processs of reasoning which all who
have watched the mind of the war-scared
citizen at work know so well, he will argue
that those who are opposed to Cook must
be hostile to the Empire. This class of per-
son will make his usual attempt to employ
the British flag as an electioneering placard.
The first and about the only plank in his
political platform will be the National
Anthem. This sort of thing at this sort of
time will be revolting to people with a sense
of proportion and equity; but all history
goes to show that it is a good business
from the Party standpoint, since nothing is
easier than to stampede the multitude on an
issue of false patriotism. The ultimate
effect must be, of course, the return of a Par-
liament representative of nothing so much
as of that sort of vaudeville imperialism
which has brought such indignity upon the
Empire in the past.
[John Bede Dalley, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
Let Us Not Splurge.
Australia . has a great opportunity if the
present war continues for any length of time.
The thought is induced chiefly by the cabled
news that “Captain Rushall’s cadets, now
in London, have publicly burnt the effigy of
the German Emperor.” The cable didn’t
say where the gallant deed was done, whether
in crowded Bond-street or in the wider spaces
of Hampstead Heath, but in any case it was
a waste of time and firewood. The spirit
which impels normally retiring persons to
set fire to counterfeit presentments of the
Enemy, and cavort foolishly round the blaze;
and to talk of tearing out the whiskers of
the Foe; and to rise up suddenly, in silent
bars and similar places, and intone songs
about lions and bulldogs and whelps and the
rest of the menagerie, is one that a self-
respecting people could do without. It
does no good at the time, and it makes all
concerned feel foolish afterwards. A dozen
years ago a friend of the writer’s was plod-


ding homewards along Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. As he reached the G.P.O., there
came, out of the skies, an unexpected dis-
cordancy. Looking up he identified 27
postmen, who should have been employed
carrying letters about or performing some
similar service, singing “Sons of the Sea” on
the top of the building. For it was Maffick-
ing evening—the occasion when elderly citi-
zens jumped publicly upon their belltoppers,
and youths tore the tram-cars off the lines
in token of Imperial fervor —and the souls
of the postmen were riotous within their
brief official jackets. It is likely that the
more intelligent of them felt gloomy the next
morning, and wished that they had taken the
war news with more self-restraint. There
are few qualities which more become either a
man or a nation than self-restraint. That
is why, in the world of sport, good losers
and _ graceful winners are so universally
admired. Cheap emotionalism and boastful-
ness and blither, on the other hand, are
reprobated—at any rate in times of peace.
Why should it be different when war comes?
About the same time that Captain
Rushall’s young friends were incinerating
their image, a Sydney warrior was reported
in the papers as follows: “I have volunteered
to go to the front. I have the best wife in
Australia and the bonniest kids in the
country, but in defence of the Empire” .
And so forth and so on. This astonishing
domestic intimacy, this careful lugging-in of
the heart-interest, was unnecessary, also
painful. What is the matter with cutting
all such bathetic rot out in future? At pre-
sent the feeling against Germany has not
been properly worked up. The press narra-
tives inseparable from all great wars in re-
gard to the cold-blooded villainy of the
enemy have barely begun to circulate. The
public mind is admirably cool and tolerant,
arid in consequence the inoffensive resident
German is as safe from insult or annoyance
as though his swollen-headed Emperor
hadn't rushed the Fatherland into vast
trouble on the other side of the earth. If
Australia can only preserve its existing
spirit till the end of the disturbance it will
have put up a fine record. It will be able to
look back on the great war, in days to come,
not only without embarrassment but with
justifiable pride. The surest way for the
nation, as a whole, to keep permanently that
calin and self-possessed attitude which, in
the individual, is commonly taken to stand
for strength of purpose and the conscious-
ness of a just cause, is for all hands to dis-
courage the purveyor of cheap bellowdrama.
The Flag—whether British or Australian—
should be left, in a manner of speaking,
in the locker; at any rate it oughtn’t to be
trailed right and left in the sawdust of
public bars. The type of nuisance who bursts
into warlike song every time he has a couple
of beers should be given the bird by his
audiences. The politician who attempts to
make a Party plank of stump patriotism
needs to have the egg of public disapproval
aimed at him. The real patriot, the indivi-
dual who is risking his life, or who is about
to, is pleasingly devoid of truculence and
braggadacio. He sings little, boasts less,
and carefully refrains from protesting his
loyalty at street corners. It would be a
proud thing for Australia if, during the
coming weeks, or months, the rank and file
of the populace were able, whatever befalls,
to emulate his line of conduct.

There is wailing in the highways,
There is cursing on the seas—
Hear the Coward in the byways?
See Despair upon its knees?
There’s the hungry, quaking sinner,
Who his brother’s soul would sell
To be safely on the inner
And the outer game as well.
But it’s not of these I’m singing,
Who are moulting ’neath their tears,
Who have only hands for wringing,
Who have merely hearts for fears,
Who can never trust their Maker —
Never sure what He’s about—
But as some trick of a fakir,
Doubting till the secret’s out.
“When we die we’ll know the answer” —=.
That’s the beetle’s creed they hold.
Leave them to that gnawing cancer
While a man-like creed’s unrolled;.
Here’s a toast to set it going:
“God, and man, and love, and pain,
And the eyes of Her, tear-glowing,
And the sunshine and the rain.”
How shall I groan by a rose hedge?
How scratch ashes ’neath the stars?
Where find “buts” to greet a love pledge?
Why run whimpering with scars?
Let me kneel to red of flowers,
Spread my arms to star-drenched sky,
Pluck love from its trembling bowers,
Crush from it its sweetest sigh.
There is wine upon the table,
And a friend to sit beside,
And a thirst that’s clean and able,
And a hand-grip to divide.
There’s tobacco for the choosing ;
Light the pipes so that they glow,
And between the dreams and musing
Let the good, red man-talk flow.
Stand up, brothers, and be hearty,

He is just a negative.

As Life’s golden jubilee—
Then go prancing on to Glory
With your bunting flying free.

The Australian Elections.
A good deal of bald and unconvincing dia-
logue has been held in the daily papers re
the “indecency” of holding the Australian
elections while the Empire is fighting for its
life. The air has been filled with protests
■and suggestions. It has been proposed to
cancel the dissolution and call together an
Illegal or dubiously legal Parliament, whose
acts might be called in question later on to
the confusion of everybody. Yet this is a
time when the need for a wholly legal Par-
liament—one whose financial and defence
’schemes are authentic beyond all question—
seems urgent. Somebody proposed—rather
too late, unfortunately—that there should
be an extensive withdrawal of candidates:
that every member should be allowed a walk-
over for his old seat, or that, if the old mem-
ber wasn’t standing, the man whom his party
put up should be allowed a walk-over. Then
there was to be a Coalition Ministry for
defence purposes, and when the war ended
there was to be another dissolution, and the
old Pqrty row was to resupie at' the 1 old
address. This wojuld have enabled
Parliament to m,eet much earlier than is
possible in the ordinary course of events.
Still it was quite impracticable. Even if
the Laborites and Liberals came to an agree-
ment, any casual scallywag, dreamer,
Domain loafer, peace-at-any-price fanatic,
anti-defence person or red-ragger, who in-
sisted on contesting a single constituency,
would break up the arrangement, and no one
can prevent some individual of the Sort turn-
ing up. Certain wild patriots proposed that
the British Legislature should pass a hasty
Act to revive the dissolved Australian Par-
liament, so that the general election might
be postponed till quieter times. But the
British Legislature, with war at its
door and German ships dropping mines in
the mouth of the Thames, has much less time
to spare than we have. To intrude upon it
with a superfluous job when it is busy voting
£100,000.000 or so for petty cash expendi-
ture, might make it really angry. After all,
there is no reason to believe that the Aus-
tralian election is interfering with defence.
The present election is the poorest, dullest
and least inspiring one that this country has
seen, for the war intelligence takes up most
of the newspaper space, and even a promi-
nent politician is lucky if he secures a dozen
lines of print. Still the business must be
done if the. machine of State is to be kept:
in working order. There is a streak of
hysteria or cowardice in the suggestion that
our regular and ordered system of Govern-
ment should be upset because, for a few days
past, some hard fighting has been in progress
at the other side of the world. One day
Australia may have to wrestle with the
problem of keeping its legislative machine
in working order while Sydney is burning
and Melbourne is in ruins.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
The Unpleasant Performance of a
Liberal Chicken.
Another chicken, one of the brood of the
Party fowl, has come home to do an un-
pleasant thing on the Liberals’ doorstep.
When Commonwealth notes were issued, the
Liberals, neither knowing nor wanting to
know the first thing about currency, set out
to damn the work of the Labor Government
by talking contemptuously of “Fisher’s
Flimsies.” Credit is a shy bird ; and, as the
private banks, being mostly on Cook’s side
of the hedge, didn’t do anything to dis-
courage the Liberals’ contemptuous scorn
for “Fisher’s Flimsies,” a steady feeling of
distrust grew until the notes were current
practically only in the country, which habitu-
ally accepts any old shin-plaster. Of course
there was nothing whatever wrong with the
money. The paper was and is backed by
ample gold. Over 40 per cent, of the face
value was and is maintained in the Treasury
vaults. For the other 60 per cent, there was
and is the backing of the whole taxable
wealth, real and personal, of Australia. No
private note ever issued in Australia had
one-tenth or one-hundredth part of this
support. Then came the crash of war, and
anxious men began to ask about the gold
reserves* of the country. Fortunately they
are unusually substantial, as a result of
many good seasons. But there is a tre-
mendous amount of work for them to do,
unless the country is to be plunged suddenly
into a most profound depression. The Gov-
ernments, having mostly borrowed heavily
from so-called trust funds and thus antici-
pated future foreign loans which they can-
not now raise, must either discharge tens
of thousands of men, or lean very heavily
upon the bank reserves, which cannot now
be replenished. The wool sales are sus-
pended ; and that industry must be financed.
The metal mines cannot get their products
away to market, and if they continue to
work even on a reduced scale it can only
be by begging for accommodation from the
banks. Thousands of coal-miners and long-
shore workmen are idle, and will remain so,
until, at any rate, Britain and her allies
have undisputable command of the seas.
They must be provided for out of these bank
reserves, too. Had not the Liberals, play-
ing the unpatriotic party game, poured con-
tempt on the country’s paper currency, the
problem would be vastly simplified. Had
they not discredited notes which have all
Australia at the back of them —had they
treated these notes as their own great coun-
try’s lOU, taking precedence over all other
debts —the public would now be as ready to
take a “flimsy” as a sovereign. As it is, the
task of reassuring the public has to be
undertaken when confidence is most difficult
to establish, and when, moreover, the finan-
cial institutions can least afford to arouse
suspicion or distrust by insisting upon pay-
ment in notes. So the curse of Party Gov-
ernment, backed by the Liberals’ short-
sighted and utterly selfish disregard for
patriotic considerations, intensifies the pre-
sent difficulties ; and if less can be done to
relieve the-depression than the- - necessities
call for, the Liberals’ blazing folly must be
held largely responsible for it.
[S. 11. Prior, 214 George-street, Sydney.)
The ’Bus' Juggernaut.
From one who helped in Lloyd George’s
inquiry into London’s street traffic: —
There are a few tilings in the advertised scheme
for Sydney mobuses that call for less gentlemanly
reticence than the prospectus displays. The hustling
promoters lay stress on the fact that the London
mobuses “while in active competition with electric
tramways”.... had receipts of over a million and a
half sterling last year. But they omit to mention
that the London ratepayer is waking up, and asking
awkward questions about how the ’bus combine is
earning its dividends. One method is by planting
on the shoulders of its trade rivals, the County Coun-
cil’s electric trams, the expense of keeping up the
roads. This fact has its importance for Sydney,
where the cost of road-maintenance is so heavy.
Trams in London were made responsible for certain
road expenses. The poor man’s motor-car—the
mobus —came along, and at first Authority, being as
usual asleep, didn’t see how things would go. The
public was in the middle of its siesta. It used the
mobus freely, and let the old-fashioned L.C.C. tram
hang. So its own tram receipts went down while
the private co.’s revenue went up. Other things
happened. The street accident rate, for instance,
grew so freely that even Authority got alarmed, and
set a Royal Commission to sit on its head. The
cost of road upkeep rose with a jump. Thus while
the general cost of road upkeep for England increased
?0 per cent, in the six years prior to 1909, in the
“Home Counties”—the bit of jtyie Cold Country
around Jjondqn—the cost rose “by anything from 27
per cent, in Bucks to' 77 per* cent.'ln Surrey! What
line is Sydney going ]to ' take 'about this sort of
thing? The public wili go' on paying for its roads,
and Private Enterprise will wipe up’ profits in the
dear old way. And this will happen' I ' whether the
Sydney mobus runs alongside the trams or in some
other road.
On this route question look at London again. The
Commission that got busy about the corpses the
motor-’buses were strewing about the streets got at
some interesting facts. Wherever the mobus was in
competition with the ratepayers’ trams, its fares
were cheaper; but on mobus routes outside that
range the charge was far higher.
Summed up, it is simply stupid to put into the
hands of Private Enterprise a public service such as
this of passenger traffic, when the Tramways Depart-
ment could easily extend its work by running motor
services to feed its trams. A number of English
towns with their trams in the hands of the muni-
cipalities have already applied for the necessary power.
They arc running their municipal trams with success.
They think they are just as well able to run motor
services auxiliary to them, and don’t see why they
should make good roads for rival services to wear
out in mopping up the traffic. Mobuses for Sydney
give a clear case for State Enterprise; there will be
little need for experimental development, and what
there is will cost little. The Tramways Department
could start trial services in. likely directions till it
hits on the right route. There is no scrapping of
plant. The route that fails sends its ’buses to swell
the service of a popular route, or puts them pro-
specting for a better variant of the route that failed.
A Victorian Method *of “Attracting”
Immigrants. *
A tired man’s immigration policy got a bad
advertisement in the Weary State recently.
Victoria’s newly introduced citizens are
always alleged to be either farm-seekers or
farm-laborers, and a Government that knew
its business would arrange to have such
arrivals met as soon as they reached here
and despatched to work in the country. But
apparently, having got them here, the Weary
State Liberals give them the glassy eye and
let them do the best they can for themselves
—which means that they wait at the Labor
Bureau for something to turn up. The
other day the Bureau officials selected 40 of
them and despatched them to Geelong, per
boat, to tackle “construction work”- —which
may mean anything, from electioneering to
hod-carrying—at Bs. per day. The wage
offered is below union rates and below the
Arbitration Court and many Wages Board
minimums for casual, unskilled labor, but
that is a detail. When they reached Gee-
long no one met them, and they were prac-
tically stranded and bushed. After a long
wait a boy-on-a-bike, apparently on his own
initiative, told them to go to the police
station, which they did ; but the law had no
use for them and urgently desired. them to
move on. After a further long wait, without
food or shelter, they got orders to proceed
to the Geelong sewerage works —where a
strike against unduly low wages has been in
progress, or in session, for the previous 14
months. They had doubts about the wisdom
of starting their careers in anew country
by strike-breaking, and while they were con-
sidering, a trades-union official happened
along—and with him the only beautiful and
humane item about the whole disgraceful
business. He explained the position and
advised them not to ruin their chances by
black-legging, and on their agreeing the
Geelong Trades Hall officials supplied them
with much-needed meals and beds, and next
day collected sufficient to pay their fares
back to Melbourne, one of them being found
work in Geelong. The occurrence speaks
well for Victorian unionists and also for
the immigrants. So far the Peacock Gov-
ernment’s side of the case hasn’t been put.
But seeing that the Fusionists are pervad-
ing the Commonwealth declaring that their
chief yearn is for land-seeking and land-
working immigrants and that Labor doesn’t
want new citizens of any sort or shape, it is
up to Cook to seize Peacock by the laugh
and make him explain what at present seems
so contradictory and generally foolish as to
be inexplicable.

“Adelaide” introduces the menagerie :
The airman can make a place untenable, but it is
no good to him afterwards, because he cannot
occupy it in force, being only an Individual in a
crazy boat. It is already recorded that a Frenchman
has dropped bombs into the old, historic, useless,
picturesque city of Nuremberg, and presently a Ger-
man will do the same for some harmless French
town. On the other hand, the Zeppelin dirigible,
which could carry a small force of invaders, is appar-
ently going to be about as much use in war as an
omnibus. Already a single French airman has
smashed one, presumably by charging straight into
it. It seems easy to do, and impossible to prevent,
if the attacker is reckless of his own life.
The aeroplane seems to be just this country’s
opportunity. It cannot —as at present constructed—
get over the ocean to bring us an attacking force;
but it can break up any small attacking force that
comes in ships. Anyone who has seen Guillaux or
Hawker play about the sky must believe that while
a warship was steaming up the harbor (or the bay,
or the gulf, or the river) one or two intrepid fliers
could drop things that would put it out of action.
One of our poets has imagined the scene. “Lean
bats,” he calls the defenders. Snakes —flying snakes
—seems better. The aeroplane can do nothing but
sting, but that one thing it can do effectively, and
should be able to do still better very soon. Given
a defending force of highly venomous, intelligent and
reckless snakes, the attack of a few tigers could be
regarded with something like calm;

Party Government was temporarily
abolished, was suspended, was ordered off,
told, to get out of the way, and generally
requested to vanish over the horizon in
Maoriland the other day, and the Constitu-
tion didn’t explode, nor did one single citi-
zen fall down dead. The occasion of the
sudden burst of sanity was the second read-
ing of the Licensing Bill, which proposes to
enable a 55 per cent, majority to carry
National Prohibition. The Bill was reck-
oned to be so vital and important that it
was declared a non-party affair, and every
member of the House of Reps, was urged
to vote according to his conscience (if he
hadn’t mislaid that article). The division
on the second reading was interesting.
Massey and Ward voted together for the
Bill. Postmaster-General Rhodes also
said Aye, but the rest of the Cabinet saul
No, most decidedly. So party went over-
board, and for once members were honest
and straightforward and didn’t think one
thing and do something else. Now, why
can’t this same, sane principle govern thQ
House at all times? Why can’t party b<?
requested to keep permanently oft the
jfremises, and every matter that comes up
for consideration be decided, on its merits
and according to the conscience of mem;
bers?
The remarks of “0.K.”: —
The pro-German address presented to the British
Ministry by a learned and wowsorious knot of citizens
struck me as being illogical if it was inspired by
national considerations, rather than by personal in-
terest. Probably the addressors mostly had German
family connections, or particular commercial reasons
for their action. Anyhow, the reference to “Ger-
many’s intellectual culture and civilising influence
upon the world at large” was a very one-eyed form
of argument. The brainy, scholars and scientists of
the Fatherland are n little crowd apart from the
millions of jingoes who talk fight over their lager
beer. Germany }s the truculent mother of the
modern military system in Europe. Politically the
Kaiser’s empire is not highly cultured. The Govern-
ment is clothed in buckram, and is a clanking,
swanking despotic power. In liberty of public speech
and freedom of press opinion Germany is not nearly
so advanced as France, or any of the English-speaking
countries. To plead that civilisation would be
retarded by British participation in the European
revolt against German arrogance was to talk non-
sense, for the spectacled lights of Teutonic intel-
lectual culture would continue to think as demo-
cratically as before, though the Kaiser’s military
power were crippled, and the Socialist party would
be all the stronger. Advancing civilisation can never
be represented by a colossal standing army. Besides,
Germany is coupled with Austria in this war of
aggression, and no British peace party would have
the gall to describe the Austro-Hungarian Empire as
a bulwark of civilisation.
The enormous value of paper currency when
backed by the assets of a nation whose
credit is beyond suspicion has just been
shown in Britain. On the declaration of
war the Bank of England’s discount rate
sprang to 10 per cent. —a figure previously
'unknown for nearly half a century. Then,
instead of sticking to the £5 note as the
paper of the lowest denomination, the Bank
was empowered to issue £1 and 10s. notes;
and the gold thus liberated from the cur-
rency flowed in so fast that within a week
the Bank was able to reduce the discount
rate to 6 and then to 5 per cent. In
Australia ex-N.S.W. Treasurer Waddell
has proposed that the private, banks should
be empowered to resume the issue of notes
up to the amount of their paid capital. There
is a far better way of easing the position if
it should want easing, which it doesn’t at
present. A private bank’s capital may not
be intact, and in any case a bank can’t call
on its shareholders for more than the speci-
fied uncalled capital, which is nil in many
cases. On the other hand, if Commonwealth
notes were issued, there could be absolutely
no question about them, because the capital
behind them is only limited by the wealth
of Australia. If the banks issued notes
they would have to correspondingly restrict
their assistance in other directions; whereas
the credit of Australia is going to waste if
it is not used in this way.
From a N.S.W. court table :—-
The apologetic attitude of a Sydney Bench when
called upon to sentence an offender who at the time
happened to be a policeman has a parallel in the
indulgence given by several N.S.W. judges to John
Hor as a witness. This is particularly so in respect
to “statements” allegedly made by accused persons
after arrest. Even a short acquaintance with the
criminal courts suggests that every constable turns
himself into a confessor. In almost every case
where the chain of legitimate evidence against the
accused is far from complete—where most of the
people present are wondering on what grounds the
arrest was made —a constable steps confidently into
the box, and what follows is usually thus: “I
arrested John Smith on warrant, charging him with
theft of the articles mentioned. That evening I
visited him in the cells. He said, ‘I didn’t think
you’d get me. No one saw me do it.’ When I asked
him what reason he had for stealing he said he had
been learning the tango and wanted to buy an aero-
plane.’ ” The evidence is admitted and successive
John Smiths, having thus confessed theft of third-
class jewellery or old boots, are committed to hard
labor. The system is hopelessly bad and a flagrant
abuse of the law of evidence. In nine cases out of
10 the policeman’s testimony is unsupported. If
any corroboration is forthcoming it arrives through
another constable who “happened to be listening.”
The Yankee “third degree” is bad enough, but this
is very much worse. It manifestly puts a premium
on perjury of the worst kind—is a permanent invita-
tion to a constable to do what in some countries the
Supreme Court emphatically forbids. Maoriland
judges, for instance, positively refuse even to listen
to evidence of the kind. A John who offers to tell
there what a prisoner “said” to him after arrest
stands a more than sporting chance of being heaved
off the premises. The sooner the N.S.W. judges can
be made to realise that a very grave scandal exists
in relation to police evidence in their courts the
better for them and for the force. A policeman has
positively no right whatever to cross-examine a man
after arrest; nor any right to accept even a state-
ment voluntarily proffered except after warning the
prisoner that whatever he says will be taken down in
writing and may be used in evidence against him.
The prevailing practice shrieks for alteration. A
policeman is even allowed to go into the witness-box
and say: “I asked the prisoner what he (etc.), but
he made no reply.” The “made no reply” is taken
as evidence suggestive of guilt.
Among the men who have recently embraced
the tyranny of unionism in N. S. Wales are
the inspectors of bad smells and putrid sub-
stances ; and they advertised the fact in
three places one day lately. One place was
the Industrial Court, where they asked for a
wages board. Another was the press, where
they published the claims. The third was the
office of the Minister for Health, where they
appeared as a deputation to show cause why
the insDector’s nose should be under the con-
trol of the Department of Health. At
present the Government finds, if required,
half the insnector’s salary, but the Shire or
Municipal Council, in order to have sole
control, may pay the full salary itself; and

MAMMA, DADDY AND CHILDREN all
LOVE “CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless “fruit laxative” cleanses the
stomach, liver and bowels without
any griping.
A delicious cure for constipation, bilious-
ness, sick headache, disordered stomach, indi-
gestion, coated tongue, sallowness —take
“California Syrup of Figs.” For the cause
of all this distress lies in a torpid liver and
sluggish bowels.
A tablespoonful to-night means all con-
stipation poison, waste matter, fermenting
food and bile gently moved out of your sys-
tem by morning without griping. Please
don’t think of “California Syrup of Figs” as
a physic. Don’t think you are drugging
yourself or your children. This delicious
fruit laxative cannot cause injury. Even a
delicate child can take it as safely as a robust
man.' It is the most harmless, effective
stomach, liver and bowel regulator and tonic
ever devised.
Ask your chimist for a bottle of “Cali-
fornia Syrup of F'gs,” which has full direc-
tions for babies, children of all ages and for
grown-ups plainly prinled on the bottle.
Beware of counterfeits sold here. Get the
genuine, made by “California Fig Syrup-
Company.” Refuse any other kind with con-
tempt. “California Syrup of Figs” is soldi
by all leading chemists, 1/1-} and 1/9.
the sanitary inspectors allege that that sole
control is no sweeter than last year’s eggs.
In any case the enlightened aldermen reckon
that sanitary inspecting includes everything
save inspecting for sanitation; and if the
inspector does get in a little work on his own
particular job he mostly strikes trouble,
directly he tackles the premises of an aider-
man or an alderman’s friend. According to
hints let loose by the deputation the ald*r-
man is often the most insanitary thing in his
district —a fact that makes the locally-con-
trolled inspector’s job almost impossible. If
he is conscientious about his work it ceases
to be his job, and if he isn’t conscientious
the job mainly becomes something else.

“Henry H.”: The German who wrote “Jena
or Sedan,” if he is still alive, may begin
to think he was a good prophet. The Ger-
man (or Prussian) army has had most
remarkable ups and downs. Frederick the
Great made the Prussian force the most
wonderful implement of war in Europe. His
successors stuck to his system, but not hav-
ing his genius they produced a wooden
machine which went to wreck in a day when
Napoleon I. attacked it. Scharniiurst,
Gneisenau, Bluciier and co. created a
new army, which chased the French to Leip-
sic and Paris and Waterloo. By the 50’s
of last century it had again become such a
matter of routine and pipeclay that the
Prussian Government caved in before Aus-
tria without a struggle. A little‘later Yon
Roon, Moltke and Bismarck built up, for
the third time within a century, the prize
fighting outfit of the earth. They are all
dead, and the outfit seems to have petrified
again, and become a huge, well-drilled weari-
ness, full of courage and stodginess and
goose-step. The German, with an inspired
leader, is as good a soldier as the world
produces. With a dull martinet in command
he slumps marvellously, and loses hope at
short notice.
The Australian Musicians’ Union has
offered to furnish 2000 soldiers for the

Thomas McCredie, one of Sydney’s oldest

Works Office and the second half of the

N.s.w. FINAL NOTICE.
Two good industries that are yelling loudly
for more Protection in Maoriland just now
are candles and printing. Last year 28,000
boxes of cheap Burma candles were dragged
to M.L., with the result that the local article
is down and out, and a lot of valuable plant
is lying idle. On printed matter the duty is
3d. per lb., but as there are frequently 2000
jam labels, for instance, in a pound of printed
matter, the duty doesn’t do much in the
protecting line. Wherefore a howl is going
up for more duty.
Thus the Sydney Telegraph on “The
North Sea Problem” (ll/8/’14) :—
As long as Denmark, which has announced her
strict neutrality, is able to observe every German
ship as it passes up or down any of the three channels
between the Baltic and the Kattegat, and can report
that information to the world at large, it is mani-
festly impossible for Germany to utilise the advan-
tage that she expects to utilise owing to her posses-
sion of two exits from the Baltic. Her surprise
attacks can always be met by the blockader with a
superior force, as long as he knows for certain through
which of the two exits the German fleet is going to
make its appearance. As the mouth of the Elbe
IS 500 MILES FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE KATTEGAT,
THIS IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT, SINCE A SHIP CANNOT BE
IN TWO PLACES SO FAR APART AT THE SAME TIME.
Truly has it been written that no man can
be in two places at once unless he is a bird.
E. L. Maitland, a man who had fined the
casual drunk and sat on the casual corpse
in many places in N. S. Wales, died at
Parramatta (N.S.W.) last week, after a
long illness. When mining wardens were
scarce in N. S. Wales, politician Gould, who
was a family connection, reckoned that
Maitland would be a good man to settle the
disputes of a goldfield; and Maitland, who
had been in business, was willing. So he
was sent up to Mount Browne, in the Far
Nor’-West, and, making good there, was
shifted to Broken Hill. The jobs of warden
and P.M. being by that time amalgamated,
Maitland was moved around; but at GO or
thereabouts he carried his yellow hair and
his kindly, benevolent disposition to Parra-
matta, and settled there for good.

You can take “The Girl in the Taxi” in
two ways. One is to approach it as though
it were intended to uplift the playgoer in an
ethical sense. It doesn’t unlift worth a cent.
Everyone in the show is either wicked, or im-
_ perceptive to the point of idiocy, or both. Two
‘of the characters want to get married; the
chief aim of the others is apparently to get
compromised. The heavy father frequents
a Paris restaurant, filled with members of
the half-world, and there meets his son, his
daughter and her admirer, and most of their
friends. They all lie vigorously to each
other and to the incredibly-dull Baroness
(wife of the heavy father), who remains
virtuously at home. Everyone embraces
everyone else’s wife, or tries to, and is dis-
covered and is driven, in consequence, to
lie harder than ever. The erring father finds
that his only son has the same dashing tem-
perament as himself, and is the prouder and
happier for it. He meets his daughter and
the lover whom he had previously barred
as a ■ rake, at the Jeunesse Dor&e Restaur-
ant, in the early hours of the morning, and
the encounter impels him to agree to their
engagement. The lady who had won a
“virtue prize” is observed by her inebriated
husband having supper with the Baron’s
son, and is pursued by him (the husband)
sword in hand, twice round the stage. This
husband also causes the Baron and his son
to be arrested for frivolity—all that the
censor has left of the “flagrant delit” scene
which probably figured in the original farce.
If it were the sort of work that inculcates
a Lesson, it would deal Morality a blow
which the combined efforts of the Churches
could never repair. As it is all as palpably
nonsensical as a pantomime, it does Morality
no earthly harm, and makes those people
laugh who have not seen every one of the
situations exploited in other plays of the
sort a thousand times before. These are
the people to whom “The Girl in the Taxi”
may appeal, and the right way for them to
take it is laughing ; for if they cannot laugh
they will fume or openly curse, the music
being thin, though melodious, and the acting
poor, on the whole.
" THE GIRL IN THE TAXI,”
AT HER MAJESTY'S,
SYDNEY.
Pomarel (C. H. Workman) in uniform , the
bird-like waiter (Chris Wren) and the girl
with the 1914 figure (Gwen Hughes).
The stars are Miss Maggie Jarvis, who
plays Suzanne, the Virtue Prize-winner, and
C. H. Workman, who is Suzanne’s comic
husband. She has much charm and grace,
and her vibrant little voice is well suited to
her numbers. He is a comedian with
a personality, and Pomarel, in his
hands, is an amusing, and almost
human circumstance. W. 11. Rawlins
(Baron Dauvray) is an indifferent singer, but
his unctuous humor has an allurement of
its own. Fred Magnus plays the role of
the Baron’s 20-year-old son with youthful
zest, and Paul Plunkett is a good-looking
lover with a nice baritone voice. Field
Fisher and Chris Wren are a couple of
preposterous waiters. Miss Gwen Hughes
has nothing much to do but stand round "and
give an imitation of an affable virgin, which
task she performs to perfection, looking per-
fectly lovely the while. There are several
other characters of this sort —nebulous crea-
tions which float vaguely into the mind of
the onlooker, and a little later vanish for
ever. The writer almost forgot in his haste
(the same thing that David used when he
said all men were liars) to mention that the
address is Her Majesty’s, Sydney.

more or less, despite the high cost of living

Processions and flag-waving are the most
popular amusements in Adelaide at present,
and the newspapers’ notice-boards the most
popular shows. West’s and Wondergraph
and the Pav. have dug out all the army and
navy films available, and are exciting general
enthusiasm. Wondergraph also shows an
ingenious “aerial torpedo,” worked , over the
audience’s heads by (so it is alleged) wireless
influence. The British scientists, arriving
at this awkward crisis, have been publicly
entertained by the University and the Gov-
ernment, but, in the altered circumstances,
Mayor Simpson’s ball is to be turned into a
plain Reception. The Anderson co. is doing
pretty well with popular melodrama at the
Royal, “The Orphan Heiress” having just
pushed the Face out of the Window, to the
great advantage of all concerned. Beth Tate
has been added to the Tivoli bill. It includes
Phil Kaufmann, a new arrival who candidly
calls himself what he is. a “coon shouter” ;
also the athletic Villions and Weldons, and a
clever lot of comedians. The King’s stars,
Brent Hayes and his remarkable banjo, and
Hayes and Rives continue to play their
feminine illusion on a trusting public. Pianist
Bauer has given a final mntinee; a man who
professes to know is lecturing on the real
meaning of Armageddon; and the Orpen
painting is getting forgotten in the rush of
other excitements.
From an Adelaide critic :—-
Ambrose Patterson is the latest to give a one-man
show in the Society of Arts gallery. He exhibits
the Salon portrait of his father, the Royal • Academy
portrait of his brother, a pleasant study shown at
Brussels, a daring “Blue Feather” (with a bright
green dress, a likeness of one of the Dyson family),
and a very good portrait-painting of himself. As
Sowden, president of the Art Gallery, said in opening
the show, one of Patterson’s strong points is versa-
tility. He has copied Manet’s “Olympia” from the
Louvre—surely the ugliest nude on record—and
another, not ugly, by Whistler. He has a remark-
able picture of fireworks by night in an old Brussels
street. His own studio and family figure in two
large canvases. The rest of the time he paints bull-
fights, or babies, or bits of landscape, frequently
beach, with or without bathers ; and in all there is a
pleasantly assured touch, as of the man who has been
there and knows. He does not open his mouth over-
wide, and red labels are already appearing on some
frames, while the Art Gallery—which already
possesses two specimens of his work —is understood
to have an approving eye turned toward §pme of the
portraits.

Wi’ bated breeth an’ whusperin’ humble-
ness the present scribe admits to a wee bit
feelin’ o’ disappointment wi’ “Bunty Pulls
the Strings.” Mr. and Mrs. Graham Moffat
and their company of Scottish players intro-
duced the comedy of Scawtch character to
Melbourne notice at the King’s on Saturday,
and although the wholesome little entertain-
ment drew the most sympathetic audience it
is likely to get during the present season, the
prevailing interest in the novelty of it all
seemed to be faintly tinged with contempt.
In the first place, the action of the play is
dated back to 1860 in order that crinolines
and other contemporaneous raiment effects
may excite an easy laugh, as in the first act
of “Milestones.” But these illustrations of
the unpicturesque fashions of Britain’s stod-
giest and most painfully respectable age—the
age when Thomas Edison was still a news-
paper boy dreaming of inventions —are only
passing essentials to the incisive moral story
of “Milestones,” whereas in “Bunty,” which
has no incisive moral story whatever, the
dressing is a permanent appeal to the most
primitive sense of humor. Why drag crino-
lines and obvious feminine unmentionables
into a comedy of Scottish character, as
though it were a burlesque? The dressing of
what is called “romantic costume comedy”
may be a good artistic excuse for the produc-
tion. Those fashions are centuries old, yet
the stage pictures are beautiful. The hooped
skirt of Bunty and * the Sunday hat of
Weelum are unbeautiful; the Scawtch Sab-
batarian sentiment of the neriod is horribly
cramped; the ideas of all the characters save
son Rab (who does at least run away and get
wet under the inspiration of his ideals) are
prettily prosaic, or even ugly, in their way-
bac/k provincialism. Then why date the
story back to the dullest Victorian age?
Compare the warm Scawtch hairt that beats
in Lauder’s modern songs of love, lassies and
friendship with the cold to tepid feelings
expressed in “Bunty Pulls the Strings.”
Tammas Biggar. after paying the embezzle-
ments of his offspring who went wrang in
Glasgow, has blotted him oot of his affec-
tions for ever, and Bunty, seemingly, doesn’t
care a bawbee what has become of her-
brither. The present writer, to be quite
candid, doesn’t love Bunty or any of them,
bar young Rab. He can’t remember the
time when he would have cared to go
roamin’ in the gloamin’ wi’ Weelum’s
affianced bride. And even shrewd, philoso-
phical Eelen Dunlop, the elderly boarding-
housekeeper who has suffered an early disap-
pointment in life without turning sour on it
—how flinty she is compared with Mrs.
Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch!
* * * *
The dialogue of the play, except when it
treats directly of the melodramatic situa-
tions, is for the most part quietly convincing,
with many droll lines in it. The character-
isation seems true to nature. The atmo-
sphere of truth pervades the two scenes. But
the plot is the same old conventional melo-
drama adapted to unsophisticated village con-
ditions. The lurid villainess is a vengeful
spinster, who listens conspicuously to - Tam-
mas’s gratuitous confession of embezzlement
and calls upon the local policeman to arrest
the houseless citizen, without a warrant, when
he comes out of kirk. The heroine defeats
the villainess by stating that the money, has
not been embezzled, after which the villainess
overhears verbal evidence to the contrary,
whereupon the heroine routs her with a
charge of misappropriation of her fat-headed
nephew’s inheritance. Another great sensa-
tion is the collapse of Tammas in the first
act, when the long arm of coincidence leads
his deserted fiancee of 25 years ago into his
domestic circle, at the invitation of son Rab,
who wouldn’t, in a natural way of proceed-
ing, have dared to invite a dog info the
backyard when feyther was aboot. The
unrealism of the plot gives the simple
naturalism of the small talk a few nasty
bumps. The play is effectively staged, and
the acting of the Scottish co. is almost wholly
free from theatrical mannerisms. Rab (Abel
Barker) and Eelen (Mrs. Moffat) are

"A ROYAL DIVORCE," AT
MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Two old war dogs.
The noisy arguments now happening in
Europe are having a favorable influence on
business at Melbourne Royal. An ancient
drama wherein the symbolical British bull-
dog has got his teeth into the French eagle’s
hooked nose is not of topical interest, neither
is the Pomp and Panoply of Napoleonic War-
at all up to date. But any old thing with
heaps of slain in the foreground and smell-
ful gunpowder explosions at the wings, and
the “Marseillaise” and “Rule Britannia”, in
the orchestra is good enough for the spirit
of these times. So “A Royal Divorce” will
flourish until further notice, and Marie
Louise will continue to wave her infant son
in the face of Josephine.
Being insufficiently Irish and particularly
rough on the reputation of “Sherlock
Holmes” (who lias many earnest admirers),
the drama of “The Burglar and the Lady”
is giving a frost-bitten appearance to Allan
Doone’s season at Melbourne Princess’s. The
season, however, is nearing its end. A series
of six farewell revivals begins on Saturday,
with “In Old Donegal,” and ends with
“Sweet County Kerry.” As the bhrothiest
bhoy in Kerry, brother Doone will breathe
his last at the Princess’s. Before he goes

Musical fixtures last week were much dis-
turbed by the rush of unreliable news from
abroad, but the Fireflies seem to be prosper-
ing at the Athenaeum Hall, owing to their
facilities for discharging ballads of battles,
and the Taits are meeting a demand for
Patriotic Pops at the Auditorium. The only
German musical event of the near future is
Leonard Borwick’s orchestral concert at the
Town Hall, where Beethoven’s No. 4 con-
certo in G minor will be dealt with by Bor-
wick and the band. This is promised for
Saturday afternoon.
Cinquevalli, reappearing once more at
Melbourne Tivoli, is the same old accom-
plished performer with the green haber-
dashery and the worried assistant. The
well-remembered cannon and billiard balls
are. still helping him to earn his salary, but
some new tricks or some unfamiliar versions
of old acquaintances make him worth a fresh
inspection. Ted Mercell, a burlesque skater,
has come in with a lot of patter that draws
am flaws from the nuts of both sexes; and
Don and Patty continue to be a painfully
voluble Yankee duet. Thornley Dodge in a
new song appears as a humorous rival to
“Captain Ginger,” and Baroness d’Astreel is
still exhibiting the “marvellous” tenor who
isn’t insulted by being, mistaken for Caruso.
Bentzeri and Lawton, society dancers, are
two acceptable newcomers at Melbourne
Bijou, where Deaves’s Mannikins continue to
hold a high place in public esteem. The
Waldrons, “farcical comedians,” are not as
farcical as they might be, but the Seawtch
pa ttering Strattons make a satisfactory
effort to entertain the multitude. Corona,
the wandering musician, is aarain on view;
also Black and White, who piffle in song and
story with the help of a large piano.
Prominent among Spencer’s effusions at
Melbourne Majestic on Saturday was
another .chapter in the history of Rocam-
bole, a newly-manufactured “terror of
Paris,” who has been bringing much revenue
to picture merchants. The main pathetic
drama, “The Battle of the Weak,” was
honored with the Order of the Damp Hanky,
while “Gambling Rube,” the star comic,
aroused a general giggle of approval.

experience of the ballet, and an extensive
acquaintance with mixed bathers in several
States, I have never before discovered ankles
of such thickness on a living woman. Now,
if an extra eighth of an inch on the end of
Cleopatra’s nose might have altered the his-
tory of civilisation, what might have re-
sulted from a superfluous three inches round
the ankle of the Egyptian siren? .1

date) ; Sothern’s “Dundreary,” 400; “Sweet
Lavender,” 900; “Mikado,” 600. Apropos,
Bancroft says, in his memoirs, that good act-
ing will hardly last beyond 50 nights. After
that there comes a tendency to’ forget the
words and be mechanical.
“T. 0.1.”: Her Majesty’s (Melb.) was put
up at auction last week. There was very
little competition. The bidding started at
£30,000, and the lot was hammered down
to J. C. Williamson, Ltd., at £35,000. Tin;
building was erected in 1887, on an original
half-acre purchased in 1839 by George
Porter, who at one time kept the Fleece Inn
on Brickfield Hill, Sydney. Mr. Porter
gave £lOO for the corner, and it was sold
last week as “a part of the G. E. Porter
estate.” The original Porter got the south-
west corner of the same intersection for a
similar sum. Other purchases by him were
the south-east corner of Collins and Bussell
streets—a swell locality—for £2OO ; three
half-acres on Collins-street,_ between Spring
and Stephen streets, for £75 each ; half-acre
at the corner of Bourke and Spring streets,
on which now stands the old White Hart
Hotel, £75; and the adjoining half-acre
south for a similar sum. This gave him the
whole of the Spring-street frontage between
Little Collins-street and Bourke-street, then,
of course, absolutely bush. He also secured
the S.W. corner of Spring and Flinders
streets, for £B3. Exhibition-street, for the
first 40 years of its existence, was known
as Stephen-street; but as the northern end
of it became the residence of Flossie, the old
name was changed when this road became
necessarily the approach to the great Exhibi-
tion of 1880.
The dead (and decayed) limit was the
production in U.S.A. of a motion picture
play in which a woman embraces a baboon.
Portion of a scene shows her in the arms
of the humble creature, with her mouth
glued to his. The Moving Picture World,
which publishes the photograph of the kiss,
says that the baboon loves the manager of
the company, but next to him he “likes the
girls best, and he experiences little trouble
in securing their society. They think him a
dear —he is so knowing and affectionate.”
This picture would make a splendid advt.
for Somebody’s Cloudy Disinfectant. The
advt. would naturally run: “Rinse your
Mouth with our Unrivalled Compound after
Kissing a Gorilla.”
“Melb”: Julius Napoleon’s “last appear-
ances” in Melbourne recall Coppin’s alleged
dictum: “Three last appearances are allow-
able —the Last, the Positively Last and the
Most Positively Last.” He worked it that
way with Brooke. But for himself he recog-
nised no rule of three. The Melbourne Pub-
lic Library has a playbill of the Queen’s
Theatre in this city for 1846, only one year
after Coppin’s first appearance here, and by
that time he had already reached the “Posi-
tively Last.” I remember that when Bar-
num’s big elephant was dying, the veterinary
surgeon said: “Jumbo’s Last Appearance.”
“Oh, dear no,” says Barnum, and got ready
to show the stuffed skin in New York and
the skeleton in Philadelphia.
“Melb” : “The Mikado” is a reminder that
the existing Princess’s Theatre opened with
it in 1885. The Queen’s started profes-
sionally in 1845 with Nesbitt in “The Bear
Hunters” and “Black-eyed Susan,” but there
had been an amateur performance before.
Coppin took it for “The Lady of Lyons”
about three months after the opening. There
was then no new theatre in Melbourne for
10 years. The Royal opened in 1855 with
Rogers, H. N. Warner and Mrs. Poole in
“The School for Scandal.” Two other theatres
rang the curtain up the same year—Coppin’s
Olympic, with Wizard Jacobs, and Astley’s
Amphitheatre with G. B. W. Lewis’s circus.
Afterwards Astley’s was the Royal Amphi-
theatre, for drama; and, still later, Hender-
son christened it the Princess’s. Coppin’s
Ilaymarket opened in 1862 with Jefferson in
“Our American Cousin.” His first season
was at the Princess’s. The old Royal hav-
ing been burned in Feb., 1872, after the
concluding fire scene in “The Streets of
New York,” the new Royal was opened
on Cup Night with “Milky White” and “To
Oblige Benson.” Meanwhile the Opera
House, on the site of the Varieties, had
opened a month or two before, with W. J.
Holloway and Mrs. Gladstone in “London
Assurance.” The Bijou, first called the
Academy of Music, opened with a concert
by lima di Murska.
“0.K.”: Australian bards are not likcdy
to acquire any increase of fame from the
efforts of Sydney H. Tyrrell, who has lately
been giving “All Australia Recitals” in
Melbourne. Certain Sydney critics (prob-
ably out of local regard for Tyrrell’s front
name) described him as a Heaven-born
spouter of Australian verse, and they also
paid compliments to his powers of memory.
But the memory he draws upon for his reci-
tations of verse by Gordon and Dennis and
others is a calamitous possession. It
enables him to inflict his amateurish un-
forcible recitations upon a suffering audi-
ence. Pie has positively no qualification
for the job save his remembrance of the
lines he delivers so uninterestingly. Sydney
H. Tyrrell as a platform entertainer is just
about “the limit.” I’m sure that Lindsay
Gordon didn’t deserve it and I don’t think
Dennis ought to be thus ill-used.
“Hermes”: There ought to be a law _ to
prevent dowagers frequenting or haunting
theatrical box plans. They should be com-
pelled to choose their theatre seats per
deputy. Of course there are some decent
dowagers, but the bulk of them who haunt
booking offices are plain dreadful. I was
struck by one such last week, or some other
old time. She stood broadbased on her in-
sufferable selfishness, bending over the plan
for the stalls, trying to make up what passed
for her mind as to which seats she would
decide upon. She stood there 264 minutes
by the clock. First she demanded of the
booking-clerk were these seats draughty.
How far were they from the fire-escape?
Where did the fire-escape give exit to? How
far were they from the aisle, as she did not
want to squeeze past more people than she
could help. They never would move their
feet. And she wanted seats right in the
middle, so that at the interval the drun-
kards would not be squeezing past her in
their haste to get to the dreadful drink.
Was the clerk sure she could see and hear
well in those seats? But was he sure they
were not too close —she just hated to be so
close that she could see the make up. Oh,
well, perhaps she had better take those seats
—but, there was just one other thing. The
polite young man placed the tickets betore
her and gently intimated that there were a
lot of impatient people behind her. »he
placed two large ham-like hands on the plan.
There was just one other thing, were these
seats just under the edge of the dress-circle
and gallery? Well, in that case she would
change them. She had read about a man
falling out of the gallery, and once a friend
of hers was nearly killed by someone drop-
ping a pair of opera-glasses. She must
have seats under the dress-circle where no
one could drop themselves or property on
her. Yes, the same position. Was he sure
these seats were not draughty? And how
far were they from the fire-escape? Where
did this fire-escape lead to? Was he sure
she could see and hear well there? Was he
sure there was no pillar to obstruct her
view? And as she sniffed and haggled I
examined her. Her greying hair was caught
up loosely in a knot that was not Grecian in
its carelessness. Her expensive clothes hung
on her shapeless figure horribly. She was
one of the useless, selfish women, for whom
some fool of a man worked and probably
robbed. She looked like one who had never
done any useful toil in her life. And when
at last she gathered her expensive skirt
round her and waddled out the place seemed
sweeter.
From London: An Irish peer, the Earl of
Carrick, was recently playing in a one-act
piece at London Coliseum, and now an Irish
baronet, Sir Valentine Grace, Deputy-Lieu-
tenant of Queen’s County, has taken to mum-
ming as a relief, from going broke on the
Stock Exchange. His Conn the Shauehraun
is getting some praise from the critics, too.
Francis McManus, who is managing the
baronet’s company, is a descendant of that
Terence Bellew McManus who was trans-
ported to Tasmania for complicity in the
Irish rising of ’4B, and nearly managed to
skedaddle from Launceston to ’Frisco.
“D.”: A friend in the business assures
me that no less than 17 cables were sent to
overseas actors by Sydney friends during a
single afternoon of last week, as follows:
“Rumored that moratorium is about to be
declared here on account of war. Come at
once.”
Evidently hotel-keeping in a country
township has failed to impress Andrew Hig-
ginson with its desirability He has bidden
a long farewell to these shores (per
Sonoma), bound ’Frisco-wards.
“ J.F.H.”: The deceased Joseph Chamber-
lain was an accomplished amateur actor in
his early youth in Birmingham. He took
lessons in elocution, and was so far ad-
vanced in the art that he was easily the
most accomplished elocutionist in the House
of Commons —admirable in delivery, delight-
fully distinct in enunciation and faultlessly
fluent. His “Mr. Puff” and “Alfred Jingle”
were his best parts on the amateur stage.
He also shared in the Birmingham “penny
readings,” specialising in selections from
Dickens. And according to one London
paper, Herbert Tree has in his drawer a
“political play” written by the statesman
screwmaker.
Francis Cellier’s reminiscences of Gilbert
and Sullivan and D’Oyly Carte, their man-
ager, make a poor, disappointing volume.
Cellier —a brother of Alfred, who composed
“Dorothy” and was for some years with
J.C.W. —was a Savoy conductor, and ought
to have known more than he tells. Instead
of meat he supplies guff like this: “D’Oyly
Carte’s master-hand steered the ship with its
rich argosy of pleasure and profit on its
prosperous voyage”; Sullivan was “a re-
incarnated Orpheus”; and Gilbert “bridled
and brought Pegasus down from the Helicon
of unrealities to the plains of earth, canter-
ing gently without appalling the senses of
ordinary mortals.” Cellier confirms the
story that it was the cost of a new carpet
that brought about the split between Gilbert
and Sullivan. Gilbert was a martinet in
controlling the Savoy stage. Carte bought
a carpet and put it down without consulting
Gilbert. The latter became vituperative and
sarcastic. Carte responded to the best of his
ability. Sullivan, unwillingly dragged into
the quarrel, sided with Carte. After each
had tried other collaborators, with very in-
different results, they came together again;
but Pegasus wouldn’t gallop a second time.
“Ruddigore,” Cellier says, was financially
the most successful of the Savoy operas, and,
paradoxically, it is the only one that has
never been revived in London.
“Parisine” : The funniest thing going is
the quarrel and reconciliation of Sarah Bern-
hardt and Rostand. Rostand sold the acting
rights of “L’Aiglon” to Bernhardt many
years ago. Lately he sold a cinematograph
right, with another lady as L’Aiglon. Bern-
hardt protested, denouncing it as an in-
fringement of her dramatic right, but would
consent if the play were named something
else, say “The Duke of Reichstadt.” Ros-
tand declined, whereupon Sarah applied for
an injunction to stop the film. On that he
wrote to her lawyer :
Maitre, —I have the honor to inform you that I
would rather cut off my right hand than instruct a
lawyer to proceed against Madame Bernhardt. I
declare that what she wishes is always good. I
abandon to her, if this compensation may satisfy her
lawyers, my entire rights in the cinematograph repro-
ductions which are worrying her, and I embrace witli
respect and gratitude her fingers, in which a legal
summons assumes for me the grace of a lily.
Sarah Bernhardt emulated Rostand as well
as she could in a letter to the Matin. Here
is an extract: —
Mr. Rostand now says that he is willing to
abandon in my favor all his rights, which are 12 per
cent, of the realised benefits, after all expenses in-
curred in producing the film are covered. These
expenses are calculated at £40,000. In my opinion
the author’s copyright will bring him about £BOOO.
I refuse to take this £BOOO. I never wished to have
any money from Edmond Rostand. The poet’s gener-
ous impulse calls for a refusal on my part. I am
advising my eminent lawyer, M. Clunet, the advocate
of the wronged, that I cannot send blue lilies to my
poet.

THE STARVING HEROINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I love the melodrama grim;
Its infinite variety
Is moral food and drink for me.
I like the villain tall and slim ;
The hero, too, who can’t keep warm
Out in the imitation storm,
My sympathies are all with him.
But most my heart is made to beat
By pure Selina’s touching woes,
When, perishing in paper snows,
With not a scrap of food to eat.
I hear the tortured creature cry:
“Oh, help! Oh, help! I starve! I die!”
My flowing tears bedew my feet.
Her face is-drawn with inward pain.
In.labored tones the victim speaks:
“I have not tasted food for weeks.
Deatli is at hand! All hope is vain!”
The comic man runs in with bread.
“Food! Food!” she cries. “God bless you,
Ned!”
And nibbles off just half a grain!

SOCIETY
Murray, Victorian Chief Secretary, and
Sainsbury, Chief of Police, met to think out
the most effective way of preserving order
amongst the roughs whose war-exuberance
was making Melbourne a bit more lively
than a prayer meeting. Hence the order to
the young constables who were turned loose
on the city streets that they were to deal
it out with their batons to any person whose
attitude threatened trouble. One John, who
had worn his uniform for only a month
or two, carried out the command immedi-
ately he got on to his beat; but by wretched
luck his mark was a suburban police ser-
geant wearing his Sunday clothes and read-
ing a war bulletin outside a newspaper office.
When the sergeant had picked himself up
and wiped the blood off his hand which the
crowd had trampled on, and after some kind
person had offered to straighten his hat and
brush his clothes, the young cop was taken
asjele and given more earnest advice than
he 'Could keep under his helmet.

From “M. D. Kuss” : Of all the press lies
that thrilled Australia at the beginning of
the war the pearl, or masterpiece, or cham-
pion in the way of unconvincing idiocy was
Sydney Sun’s cabled message about the
French doctor, who, with four assistants,
was found by the Germans inserting cholera-
microbes into a well in Metz. Metz, though
a mighty German fortress, is, as regards its
burghers, more passionately French than
Marseilles. The town water supply is
drawn, not from wells, but from the Moselle
river, which passes right through the town.
If there is such a superfluity as a well in
Metz it is a private enterprise affair, like a
tank in George-street (Sydney). But even
assuming that a French doctor existed who
knew of some well in, or near, Metz, which
was pretty generally used, and who was will-
ing to consign a number of his countrymen
to an agonising death on the off-chance of
poisoning some German soldiers, the cable-
man’s yarn is equally incredible. When a
criminal decides upon an enterprise of this
description he does not go forth in the full
panoply of war, so to speak, and with a posse
of assistants at his heels. He does not drive
a poison-cart to the place where the infamy
is to occur and label the contents “cholera
microbes,” and hold a service, and sing his
national anthem, and bare his head and give
three cheers before transforming the water
below to so much liquid death. Rather does
he proceed warily and alone. His dreadful
property is contained in a tiny phial, which
is broken furtively upon the framework at
the top of the well, the owner having first
assured himself that there is not a soul in
sight. Well-poisoning is one of the last
crimes at which a man is likely to be dis-
covered. It is likewise about the last enter-
prise to which a civilised doctor would take,
either in an enemy’s. country or in a region
where most of the water-drinkers are liable
to be his own countrymen.
The law, as a rule, has a sacred regard
for property, but it was moved to a pro-
found disrespect for a Paddington owner the
other day. He was charged 12 separate
times with being the person who enjoyed the
rents of premises which were in “such a
state as to be, and are, a nuisance.” Just
what condition a house has to be in to be a
nuisance was not explained. There are
hundreds of places in Sydney with walls
that seem to be suffering from leprosy, and
windows that don’t exist, and floors that are
mainly dirt, and roofs that are a gamble,
and which possess every incohvenience and
lack everything else; and as the law doesn’t
regard them as a nuisance, a place which
does come within the category must be past
praying for. In each of the 12 cases at
Paddington the owner was ordered to pay
6s. costs, and told that hard labor at Long
Bay was waiting for him if he had not
complied with the municipal requirements
by August 27.

Someone recently asked Victoria’s Chief
Sec. John Weary his opinion of the U.S.
scheme of employing women as John Hops
br Jane .Cops. The statesman was non-
committal. The plan might be advantage-
ous or it might not. lie was not fully
informed on the 'qfiestidn; but would con-
sider it in its many and varied aspects and
call foD reports and opinions. He would
perhaps appoint a Royal Commission to
delve into the matters but citizens are shy
of these abominations and it is difficult to
build one nowadays. One lonely spark of
accidental humor gleamed from the reply:
“Possibly _ policewomen could make certain
inquiries in connection with criminal inves-
tigation better than some policemen.” As
though they could do as badly, much less
worse,
FAIR EXCHA NGE.
GINGER: "’Ere! Wot d’yer mean be knockin'

This is a free advertisement. Nobody
pays a copper for it. While there is whoop-
jug about wars and rumors of wars a leg-up
is due to a firm which sticks solidly
to Australian business. Amid all the
smoke and din and howl of battle Beale and
Co., of Sydney, advertise that they don’t sell
German pianos, and that their instruments
are made in this country. At one time Beale
and co. made sewing machines in Australia,
but the craving of the Foreign-trade and
Bruce Smith and Joseph Cook crowd for
German goods was so intense that the busi-
ness became hardly worth following. Bat
in the piano business Beale and Co. still
disclaim any connection with Kaiser Wil-
liam’s country.
THOROUGH.
EGBERT: "Yaas, when I proposed
to Flossie she asked me for a little
time to make up her mind.”
MARJORIE (the hated rival): "Oh!
so she makes up that too, does
she? "
“Henry Horsecollar”: This is thb first
axiom in war: Any old set of tactics is good
enough provided the right man is behind
the tactics. Napoleon I. defeated his early
enemies by concentrating his forces and
smiting the centre of their widely-extended
array like a sledge-hammer. He struck
the beginning of his supreme disaster at the
hands of Barclay de Tolly, who spread out
an inferior army over a line two or three
hundred miles long, and played the scattered
game as it should be played. The Duke of
Cumberland did Napoleon’s great concentra-
tion device at Fontenoy before Napoleon
was born, and Marshal Saxe battered his
great column as if it was a fortress and
broke it up. It was simply a target for him.
Ragohath Rao, the Mahratta, was seized
with the inspiration of planting his inferior
army on the superior enemy’s line of retreat
so that the battle must be the dead fihish of
one or the other, as each was ctit
off from home. He had the swollen-
headed idea that he was the one general in
a hundred who could take chances of the
sort. It proved that he had accurately esti-
mated his own head, for he came out on top.
I think all the books on tactics should be
burned, and every general and admiral should
start afresh. You can read 100 books on
tactics and only fall into greater confusion.
One of the best early writers on war sub-
jects was the Archduke Charles of Austria,
and he admitted in his later years that his
successes _ against Napoleon I. were gained
because, in the heat of battle, he forgot his
carefully-elaborated theories. When, in the
last hour at Aspern, he seized a banner and
led an infantry regiment in person because,
its ammunition having given out. it hesitated
to face the French batteries with only the
bayonet, he burst up all propositions
and made his elaborate military volumes
waste paper. They were never saleable pro-
perty afterwards. His only excuse was that
he Got There.
Wars may destroy nations and elections
smash up Fusions, but the Divorce Court
proceeds on its dissolvent way. and the
casual pair who married, chiefly because
there was a registrar’s office handy, and
nothing else doing, are put asunder as of
yore. A lady of this type transpired in
Melbourne lately. She had married in’o6 (after
having been destroyed), but from that dav
onwards had seen nothing of her life’s mate,
although, as a matter of fact, he lived only
in the next street. His Honor, being in a
casual mood himself that day, did not bother-
to_ inquire into the why and wherefore of
this remarkable procedure, but granted the
damsel her decree on the spot. He felt
probably that there are cases into which it
is not good to delve over deeply.
“Briner” : The Germafi steamet Pfalz hid
experienced the second hostile shot ever fired
in Hobson’s Bay. The first was seht on its
mission about 60 years ago. The circum-
stances were related to me by Thomas Cook,
who had been a cabin boy aboard the English
war brig Fantome, an old prize taken from
the French in the Napoleonic wars. His son
is a leading official in the Melbourne Public
Library. While about 400 ships were in
Hobson’s Bay, mostly detained by crews hav-
ing gone off to the diggiiigs, thete Wfts keen
competition to get sailors. The Fantome
was there, very short. The captain eagerly
scrutinised all vessels to see if any shirts
were hung up in the rigging—d sign that men
Wanted to enlist. The tfuchlent Captain
Forbes had just scratched up d crew for the
March Polo. The new men quarrelled with
him at once, and four hung up shirts. The
Fantome captain identified them and lowered
a boat. Forbes tried to get his ship away;
but the Fantome fired a gun, the merchant-
man hove to, and the four recruits were
taken off to sign on with her Majesty.

A PLEASANT TONIC FOR ANYBODY WHO IS
“RUN DOWN.”
There are many people having no serious
ailment who yet feel “run down ’’ or out of
condition. Appetite is capricious, digestion
imperfect, and there is a general feeling of
depression and lack of vitality. In most of
these cases, the trouble is due to some de-
rangement of the digestive functions, and once
this is corrected, there is an immediate return
to normal health and vigour. It may be con-
fidently stated that for this “run down”
condition and for correcting digestive irregu-
larities, there is nothing better than a course
of Angiep ! s Emulsion. This remedy not only
promotes appetite and soothes and strengthens
the organs of digestion, but it exerts a most
invigorating tonic influence upon the general
health. Angier’s Emulsion is pleasant to take,
and agrees perfectly with delicate stomachs. It
is recommended for lung troubles, digestive and
bowel disorders, and for "all run down”
conditions and wasting diseases. It is par-
ticularly successful in those "run down"
conditions associated with nervous symptoms,
and also in those numerous cases, that are
due to an unhealthy condition of the digestive
organs, with faulty assimilation. It must not
be forgotten that Angier’s Emulsion exerts its
full soothing, healing, disinfectant action
' throughout the entire digestive area, therefore
it is of value even to the average healthy
person, because it keeps the digestive organs
in a normal healthy condition to perform their
functions naturally thus making the use of
pills unnecessary. For twenty-one years it has
been prescribed by the medical profession, and
is a recognised standard remedy of proved
value that may be taken with absolute confi-
dence. Of all chemists at 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.

Melbourne City Council has been about 20
years trying to construct an up-to-date set
of building regulations. It has utterly
failed to cope with the dust nuisance. Its
inspection and control of restaurants, etc.,
is a farce, and the numerousness of its rats
is beginning to incline thoughtful people to
the view that it is entering the rodent-
breeding industry as a business. But now
and then it really acts. Thus it has just
decided to erect four drinking fountains
(imported, of course) at city corners, for
the-coming summer. And this time next
year it will probably wake up again and do
some more work on similar lines.

An Austrian officer lately in Sydney
declared that the Kaiser made an egregious
ass of himself at the last German military
play-manoeuvres. William insisted on taking
personal command of the army which was
to vanquish the other army—on paper. His
tactics were such that the generals of the
forces doomed to defeat were driven nearly
dotty by their efforts to be always getting
the worst of it. They were kept busy avoid-
ing chances to put the blessed Kaiser’s army
in a position where unconditional surrender
would have been the only alternative to total
annihilation. The Austrian moved on too
soon to explain how he felt at the prospect
of a war in which the fortunes of his own
country are bound up with those of the
Imperial megalomaniac.
THE MISSING INVITATION.
FOREIGN MINISTER FOR LAPLAND (pettishly, to secretary): "Is this to-day’s tast?”
SECRETARY: “Yes, sir.”
MINISTER (feverishly running through letters): “ Well , where's our ultimatum from
Germany? He MUST have sent one.”
Back in 1860 the General Grant, a sailer
bound to London from Australia with an
alleged cargo of gold, was lost at the Auck-
land Islands, at the southern end of Maori-
land. Numerous syndicates have since
dropped good gold to the bottom of the sea
in an attempt to salvage what was already'
there. A couple of years ago a Yankee
named E. C. May appeared suddenly in
Dunedin (M.L.), and began to talk about
the "untold millions” lying down at the
Auckland Islands. He got a license from
the Southland Land Board (which controls
the islands) to go after the treasure, where-
upon he formed the usual syndicate and
purchased a vessel to take his plant to the
scene of the wreck. Just about then an
infuriated creditor swooped down, collared
the ship and sold it to square his little bill.
May retired on U.S.A., while tiie syndicate
went into mourning. The other day he
wrote that he had got a new boat and was
heading for (lie Bluff. Someone in Jack
Johnson Land is behind him, but he has pro-
mised to let the ancient M.L. syndicate into
the profits, if there are any. He will have
to find that out shortly, for the Southland
Land Board recently gave his representative
notice that unless the boss got to work at
the Aucklands inside three months his license
to operate there would be cancelled.

“Hermes”: While busy superintending the
removal of my lares and penates from one
rack-rented tenement to another last week I
was interrupted by the arrival of a perfect
stranger in a Hugger coat, top hat, spats and
other things. His tie was like the tree the
Lord looked at sideways, awry, and the knot
of it had got round under his ear. He seized
me by the shoulder. Three times he tried
to speak and choked, but at last lie got con-
trol of the vocal apparatus, and in a series
of wild barks informed me that six German
warships were off the coast of Queensland,
that Cairns was in flames, and Rockhamptoh
“spiflieated.” He seemed to believe it, too,
and drew such a lurid picture of the atro-
cities committed by the Teutonic bluejackets
that a school youngster who was listening
burst into a loud howl and fled. He de-
manded to know what I intended to do about
it. In fact, he demanded three times, oh each
occasion growing more vehement. I declined
to accept any responsibility, bht told him I
thought things were all right, as Admiral
Tatey and I had that very morning placed
a number of very powerful magnets across
the floor of the Harbor, just inside and out-
side the Heads. These, I explained at great
length, were composed of soft iron, which,
when charged with electricity, became so
powerful that any steel or iron ship attempt-
ing to pass over them would be drawn down
to the floor and there held. He listened
attentively, got me to explain the scheme to
him several times, became quite calm and
reassured, and remarking that it was just
THE SUIT.
"What's a divorce suit, mummy , that this
paper talks about?”
“A suit of pyjamas, probably.”
wonderful what “They” do nowadays* shook
hands and departed. Poor beggar! he was
quite sober, too. He was merely the first
lunatic of the war.

From Maoriland:—
A Christchurch jeweller went to the ’phone the
other morning and was told that the female voice
at the other end of the wire was the property of
one of the Flat City’s “naicest” people. The voice
further stated that it desired to give its niece a
present, that the young lady would call during the
morning, and would the jeweller see that she got a
nice watch and charge it to the voice? The jeweller
murmured “My oath!” or words to that effect. An
hour later the “niece” . drove up in a smart car,
selected a £7 watch, which she said auntie would
pay for, and departed. Later in the morning the
original voice spoke over the wire again and said
that the niece was so delighted with the watch that
her great joy had prompted her uncle to chase her
with a present, so she would be calling again to
select another article which was to be charged to Mr.
Excessive Importance, a person of great tonnage in
the level town. So the “niece” appeared again and
selected a ring, value £5 10s.! (Not £55 10s.,
for her little, servant-girl mind couldn’t soar to that
height.) This made the jeweller suspicious, so
during the afternoon he called up Mrs. Excessive
Importance and inquired if the ring was all right.
Ten seconds later a frantic jeweller was bolting for
the police, and a very “naice” person was in fits
because her name should have been used to perform
a “vulgar fraud.” At the Magistrates’ Court the
little servant girl, who had victimised a big crop
of tradespeople with her telephone system, was
handed 12 months hard labor.
The war has brought grief to many, but
to none more than to Rev. Snowball Derry
and Local Preacher Robinson Monkey-Shave.
As an outcome of the shindy in Ulster the
Orange business was looking up in Aus-
tralia for the first time in about quarter of
a century. People who, under normal cir-
cumstances, wouldn’t have touched Orange-
lsm with a 40-rod pole were beginning to
join absurdly-named Lodges and to clothe
themselves in preposterous regalia in the
belief that in some vague way they were
thereby shoving along the cause of Empire.
Anglican clerics who had been wont to spurn
the- Yellow Pup propaganda as an appur-
tenance of Nonconformity, were realising
that there might be money in the game, and
were coming into it in increasing numbers
weekly. The churches and chapels of the
militants had begun to fill. Solvency was
staring many an indigent minister in the
face for the first time since he started toil
in the vineyard, or —more appropriately, per-
haps—-cock-pit. And then war came and
brought with it a temporary peace that was
utterly accursed from the sectarian stand-
point. The Ulsterites and the Nationalists
in Ireland realised that they were all Irish-
men whatever their political differences.
1 here is nothing so binding as community
ot peril. War has its drawbacks, but it is
a great refiner.
“Dry Toast” lias a
vision:—
I sat at a rather dull
concert the other even-
ing and fed on a dozen
or so feminine heads. I
shifted my seat during
the interval, and fed on
more heads. Most of the
older women had what
are usually described as
“good heads of hair.”
The younger ones, up
to (say) 35, were in
dire plight. I can under-
stand now the magenta,
the puce and the red
wig. Our women are
going bald. Among
those I sat near the
affectation of a careless
arrangement of the
thatch appeared to be
the most popular. Pain-
fully inadequate wisps
had been pinned in below
and plugged on above,
eked out in most cases
with fresh supplies of
side and back rolls, hot
from Madame Coiffure’s
oven. The future is clear,
and I am much elated.
Wigs are going to come
for a time into their
own and hide these ill-
dowered polls. Then —
hurrah ! —t h e scissors
will be laid at the root
of the vanishing tresses,
and Angelina will be
converted to the niddtj of
I’crfcy: A grhat burning

bf the moment will take
place, and the ashes Will
be gathered into aii urn fob preservation at Can-
berra. Gloiy be! Let King O’Maliey bfe the pall-
bearer.
The legal fratebnity thdt sb loves the
jingle of thfe nimble Bs. Bd. is having dbdiit
16 different types of tidnvtilsions in Mao in-
land jiist ndw, because A new regulation hds
comb into force under which the Public
Trustee is permitted td administer estates
under £2OO without obtaining probate df the
will. Signs a declaration and
forges straight ahead i with the dividing of
the cash. Gent. One is waving its horsehair
and yelling “Robber!” or words to that
effect. But of course the law never did
take kindly to the Public Trustee.
It is a sad business to have a well-meaning
and enthusiastic and brilliant ass for a
supporter, and the Old Man at Vienna pro-
bably felt that when he issued his belated
declaration of war against Russia at the end
of last week. The German Kaiser has never
shot off anything more dangerous than his
mouth since his reign commenced. He has
apparently always known himself for a
nervous, timid, hesitating man, yet he had
to live up to the garish Holienzollern tradi-
tion and look like a worthy descendant of
the great Elector and Frederick the Great.
So lie roared twice as loudly as a strong
man need have done. In one of his moments
of frenzy he issued his second ultimatum that
Russia must keep the peace with Austria
over the Servian trouble, and when he was
scorned and rejected he had either to go to
war or declare his true character and eat
thistles for the rest of his days. It is a
fair gamble that the Ancient who hides
behind his whiskers at Vienna had laid his
plans to get the largest possible amount of
satisfaction out of the Servians, and yet back
out with dignity before he drifted into actual
war with Servia’s backer. But his own
maddened and incoherent friend rushed) to
his aid, just as a well-meaning person may
ring up the tire brigade when an old-clo’
shop is burning and spoil the chanc„e of col-
lecting the insurance. It was probably a
bitterly profane old Hapsburg who issued
his declaration of war last week. .

—News item.
A thousand things inspire my soul with sorrow —
The memory of boyhood’s squandered years,
The thought of where I’m due to dine to-morrow,
Stray visions of some long-chucked girl in tears.
I often pass an hour in mute bewailings,
When brought to book by old-time sins and failings.
I draw myself aside and ponder sadly
On what I am, and what I might have been,
When matters go exceptionally badly.
At times like these I feel both low and mean.
(.When plunged in recollections dark and evil
1 look, I like to think, a Perfect Devil )
I also gather gloom from watching fighters
Assault each other madly in the ring,
From listening to militant State-righters,
And hearing songs about our Gracious King,
And losing ready money at the races
To raucous men with predatory faces.
But, worse than all, just now, is this reflection:
(More grief-inducing than a suicide,
More dreadful than the prospect of detection
To one whose ways in Commerce have been snide,
More hateful than a U.S. Trust to Sherman.)
/do not owe a farthing to a German.

WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the foreground streaming eyes,
In the distance battle cries.
Down the skyline blue and dim
Sinks his ship—Christ shelter him!
Just a soldier gone to war,
But —he was the babe I bore,
And I buckled on his sword
Like a soldier's mother, Lord.
Other mothers need his care,
Babes that other mothers bare,
And I were the poorest thing
'Did I grudge him to his King...,
So, with smiles, I bade him go,
Choked the sob and anguish throe;
But above the martial hymn
Wails my heart: Christ shelter him!

AND ITS EFFECTS.


WHAT DYSPEPTICS SHOULD KNOW.
PHYSICIAN’S TIMELY ADVICE.
The fact that few dyspeptics really under-
stand the cause of their trouble is probably
the reason why drugs are still used to such
an alarming extent. The practice is wrong,
however, and is strongly condemned by many
physicians.
The presence of excess acid in the stomach
is the cause of practically all forms of
digestive trouble, and this can be neutralised
and rendered harmless by the occasional use
of ordinary hi sura ted magnesia—a product
which cau be obtained of any chemist.
Physicians use bisurated magnesia them-
selves as well as recommend it to their
patients, because they recognise that it not
only overcomes dangerous stomach acid and
thus ensures easy digestion but by its use
no harmful drug is introduced into the system,
and therefore there can be no unpleasant
after-effects. Half a teaspoonful taken in a
little water after meals is usually quite
sufficient to keep the food contents of the
stomach free from fermentation and acid,
thus ensuring normal digestion.*

A miserable German gardener in Mel-

When war starts on a large scale, after
a long interval of comparative peace, the
appointment of the commanders, is a gamble.
Britain has Kitchener, whom it knows by ex-
perience to lie a hard-fighting and strenuous
man. Bulgaria, if it comes into the trouble,
has something apparently approaching a
genius in Savoll. Essacl l'asha, whose little
country may possibly get into the mix-tip.
has a bit of a reputation. France, Germany,
Austria, Belgium and Holland Lave to
depend on men who rose by seniority.
Russia lias the, lessons of the Japanese
war to guide it. These lessons are
that it possessed one very tine admiral
who was killed, one very fine general who
was killed, and a very respectable general
who is now too old to be of much account.
At stub a time as the present the country
that finds its Napoleon or its Nelson eaily
may do well, and the one that iinds him too
late often does badly. In the war of 1870 71
France dug out the best European general
of his day, but by the time Clianzy got his
chance there was nothing for him to lead
uave a mob of clerks and plougli-hoys, and
I lie control of affairs had fallen into the
hands of a patriotic but excited lawyer. The
last hope that Clianzy had of turning the
tide was mined by the strategy of the excited
lawyer.

COURAGE.
THE GIRL: “ You will, of course, go to the
war and prove yourself a man? ”
VALIANT W EED: “And leave yer for some
bloke who's funked to go! My oath, I
don't.”
“Henry Horsecollar” speaks:—
Iho common idea last week, when Europe took
hie, was that the German lvaiser is a, monster of
iniquity and a perfect demon of intrigue, diplomacy
ami underground engineering. Also, he was expected
to howl in the forefront of the battle like Uriah
(not Heep but the Hittite). I beg to submit that
the theory is wrong. During all the days of his
reign the Kaiser has worn in spirit a huge hat like
King O’Malley's. He has had the limelight on him
like George Rignold in the old days, lie lias had
a long feather hanging clown his back like Marshal
Tilly, but then Tilly was a tremendous fighter, and
had a right to wear any sort of red feather that
suited him. William 11. has seized,.the standard
and led a faltering regiment to a last stupendous
effort like the Archduke Charles at Asjvern, but lie
did it in his dreams while the Archduke did it in
reality. He has called, in his mind, on his broken
cavalry to “Come to Hell with me,” as Concha did—
but be only called in his mind, so be didn't get there.
He piled up armies and fleets and built strategic rail-
ways—and still he kept the peace till his vanity fill
on his head like a cathedral, and he drifted into
war against his will. He should have died of old
age in his uniform, like a much greater man who
went before him, and been lifted up by two atten-
dants in his last moments, and finished life with the
shout: “A King should die standing 1” The great,
noisy, peaceful, well meaning scene-shifter of Kurope
might have made a brilliant second-in-command, but
ill-fortune cast him for the leading part, and he
was never equal to it. A day came when his pose
got on other people's nerves. Then a misplaced man
was called upon suddei ly to show if be really was
another Tilly, or whether he only resembled that
strenuous anil garish gentleman in his clothes. Why
speak unkiuely of him? lie has tried conscientiously
to live up to his job. like the bee which was
appointed an honorary elephant.
“SAY WHEN, JOHN."
Maoriland lost a pioneer the other day
when W. B. Fisher passed over at Christ-
church (M.E.) aged 94. He arrived in Nel-
son from England in 1842. and was one of
the survey party that was mostly wiped out
in the Wairau massacre. 11 is life was saved
by an old Maori woman, who pushed him into
a canoe and covered him with a blanket
until the butchering was over. Afterwards
he was smuggled on hoard the man-o’-war
that was sent to deal with the butchers.
Tutor lie became famous locally as a drover,
and took many large mobs of sheep from
Nelson to Canterbury and store bullocks from
Christchurch to the big sheep stations of
North Canterbury. Then he became old
(which mav happen to anybody) and died
(which happens to everybody).
Attorney-General Hermann Ilomburg, of
South Aus., son of the judge lately dead,
has announced that the many citizens of
German extraction in.that State consider
themselves good Australians, and will behave
as such, whatever happens. Mostly* they
are descendants, in the third or even fourth
generation, of the men who left Germany
about 1848, on account of political troubles
there, and were encouraged to settle in B.A.
by G. F. An gas. The name continues, but
as a rule there is by this time nothing else
at all German about the man who bears it.
Names don’t really count for much. When,
one considers Patrick McMahon. President-
of France: and Ambrose O’lliggins...Viceroy
<>l Peru; and Bernard O’Higgins. Dictator
ol (’llili ; and John O’Donohue. Viceroy of
Mexico; and O'Donnell. Premier of Spain;
and Disraeli, the Englishman: and Brown
and Lacy, the Austrians, it really seems that
everybody bar Smith may rise to high dignity
in any country. Poor old Smith is of no
account at all.
“Penman” gives an old colleague of nearly
50 years ago a send-off:—
Henry ( til lett .emerged on the Argus as a reporter
in 1803. 11 is powers were not guessed at for a con-
siderable time. Indeed, liis soul was not in journal-
ism. Like Windsor, for so long editor of the Age, he
was ambitious to become an author Both of them,
successful journalists, were of an aloof kind. ' The
yarn went that .Gullett was bent on writing tragedies.
He took a batch to London, but failed to got a
publisher. He was in those days quaint, quizzical,
cynical, with a tinge of nrlanc'.udr. From circum-
stances in my knowledge, 1 think I may venture to
state that lie was disappointed in love. If so, he was
lucky, for he married one of the most superior
women in Australia, the “Queen Bee” of journal-
ism. Under her benign, influence the later Gullett
was a different man. We all know how cheery and
eminently practical he was in middle and past-middle
life. The little man of the little black sideboards
became him of the ample brown heard, hairy almost
up to the eyes. Yet, as with Windsor, there was
always a na-ir-on, of disappointment. Sometimes he
reminded me- of a razor cutting wood.- The Argus
kept, him a good while doing paltry police-court work.
Then he found his opportunity as correspondent at Galle,
before the cables were laid to Australia. Next he was
editor of the Australasian, until Sydney called him
and gave the thoroughbred the chance to do his
greatest work.

Paris during the siege of 1871, and is still

The WILD CAT

For Australian banks to do the utmost
that their resources are capable of, their
first step, as The Bulletin sees it. is to
enter into a general guarantee of one
another. There is a precedent for this in Eng-
land, where no one bank can now go down
through a run being made upon it. There
are at present no weak banks in Australia.
Plainly, however, there are some which
are not so capable as others of resist-
ing a pressure upon their gold resources.
Even if the position became infinitely worse
than it is at present or appears likely
to be. the knowledge of the fact that every
bank stood behind every other bank would
establish confidence.
That is for the banks to do among them-
selves. So far as the Commonwealth is
concerned, its part might be somewhat sim-
ilar to that which was played by the Queens-
land Government when it undertook the sole
issue of notes 21 years ago. The Government
then, in return for (is. Bd. in gold and 13s.
4d. in long-term deposits, supplied whatever
notes the banks required ; and the notes were
legal tender. Thus a bank with £IOO.OOO in
gold received £300,000 in legal tender, and
the Treasury took the gold. The Common-
wealth’s credit being greater, it might now
be sufficient if it held (as the law pre-
scribes) 25 per cent, (that is, ss. in the £)
of gold. With this enormous increase in the
legal tender at the banks’ disposal, there
should be no question, even under the most
adverse conditions, of the banks’ ability to
stand up against a pressure which this paper
does not anticipate, but which nevertheless
ought to be prepared for ; and at the same
time they would be in a position to give
freer assistance to their clients, and thus
help in tiding the community over this
period, with the least possible dislocation of
trade and industry.

After 55 years’ service, general-manager .1.
D. Law has retired, and George Stewart,
who has been acting g.m. of late, has been
made a fixture in the chair. Mr. Law has
stayed long enough to see practically tin* last
of the boom wreckage removed. In 1897,
when the bank had begun to shift its old
long-term deposits by heavy pre-payments,
it separated for the first time the foreclosed
properties from the other assets. In that
year they stood in the books at £241,754,
which was £26,762 less than they had cost
the bank. Though it is highly probable that
some other properties fell in later on, the
active real-estate market of the last few
years has enabled the co. to reduce the item
to £24,255. llow the operation has panned
out it is impossible to say; but. judging by
the experience of two or three other Mel-
bourne banks, it is probable that, on the
whole, more than written-down book-value
has been realised; and the chances in that
case are that the surpluses have been turned
into a contingency fund to protect other
valuations. The experiences of the last fort-
night show that an inner reserve of that
sort is a handy thing to have about the
premises. It doesn’t lake many hours for
good business to turn bad sometimes; and
there are occasions when it is an enormous
advantage for a bank to be able to make
good the loss out of an inner reserve and
sail on.placidly.
I,ike most other Australian banks, the Vic-
toria, either by good luck or good manage-
ment, lias strengthened its cash position in
the past 12 months: —

Free deposits and bills, etc., total £.’>.l4X 627.
and the liquid assets are £2.654,948. Thus
85 p.c. of the liabilities at call (excluding
the few thousands in notes which are not at
all likely to come in promptly) are repre-
sented by what are liquid assets under nor-
mal conditions. In coin, bullion, Australian
notes and cash at bankers there was
£2,081,882 at the end of the half-year, and
that was a very substantial 65 p.c. of all
call liabilities. A trifle of this may have
been in London—probably not as much as
the management would like, in view of the
big rate which call money can now earn
there.
Besides being very well placed to meet
any sudden demand upon it. the bank is
strong also from the point of view of the
fixed depositor. The capital has indeed been
unnecessarily strong for the business done:
hence the comparatively small dividends paid
on the capital. Funds belonging to share-
holders total £1,861.852: the public’s money
in the business is £7.524,142. Thus £1 of
capital and reserves has to protect only £4 of
the public’s money—an uncommonly small
risk for a bank to carry. For that reason,
as indicated just now, profits are compara-
tively small. Calculated on capital and re-
serves combined they have been lately as
follows:
Dec., 1909. .£5 17 2 p.c. June, 1912. .£6 19 Bp.c.

With solid and influential backing (the
Money Millers have always figured largely
in this bank), progress of late years has
been very substantial: —

And in spite of the set-back that the world
is giving itself now, there is no visible
reason why the progress shouldn’t continue.
Unlike N. S. Wales and other States, Vic-
toria hasn’t been booming to any great
extent on borrowed money. Its prosperity
lias been built almost wholly on good wool
clips, high prices for meat, fair wheat har-
vests, a largely increased acreage under
crop, and a tariff which has given more
assurance to manufacturers; and, though
our best markets may be lost for a while,
the world will soon want food, and we shall
probably be in a better position to supply
it than anybody else.

The capital is now £466,373, of which
£166,373 has been issued in bonus shares
during the past'eight years. I‘rior to that,
in 1899, when the present co. was formed,
the capital had been watered up from
£60,000 to £120,000. The amount made
available as bonus six months ago was
£116.666 (one share for every three of the
350,000) ; but as the capital was increased
by only £116,373, presumably the odd £293
(representing fractions, maybe) has been or
will be distributed in cash. The published
accounts allege that the net profits for the
half-year were £17.905, “after making pro-
vision for depreciation, etc.” You are never
permitted to know how much that provision
is. So far as can he made out, only £3B
has been added to the visible “reserve for
depreciation, public risk and contingencies”
during the past half-year. But after climb-
ing half-way up the table you will see that
£79.410 of hidden reserves were disclosed in
1910. and there is very little doubt that
some revenue is still being stuffed away.
The co.’s practice has been to pay some
of the bills for new boats out of revenue.
In the past three years these changes have
occurred:—
June, ’ll. June, T 4.
Assets apart from ship and landed
property .. .. .. £98,500 £75,687
Liabilities .. . . . . 6,338 12,055
More or less liquid surplus .. £92,162 £63,632
Thus liquid and semi-liquid assets have been
drawn on to the extent of £28.530, and
£61,897 of new capital has been got in;
total of the two items £90,427. For this
and probably a trifle derived from the sale
of: land the co. has provided itself with the
harbor steamers Kubu, Kirawa, Kanangra
and Kuramia, along with a horse punt and
live Parramatta River boats, though one or
two of these additions were old boats re-
modelled and refitted. On the whole, it is
doubtful whether these vessels cost a
very great deal more than the £90.427 which
was supplied out of new capital and liquid
assets accumulated prior to June. 1911. At
any rate, it is fairly certain that the undis-
closed profit put into new vessels, etc., during
the past three years has been nothing like
it was in the previous three years:—
June,’oß. June,’ll.
Assets apart from ship and
landed property .. .. £37,409 £98,500
Liabilities 2,698 6,338
More or less liquid surplus.. £34,711 £92,162
So in those three years the co. added £5T,451
to its surplus of liquid and semi-liquid
assets. Meantime it got in £77,824 of capi-
tal. Difference between the two. £20.373.
With that £20,373 it provided itself with
£13,000 worth of land and three boats,
besides making large payments on account
of two others. However, though higher
wages and other costs have, it thus seems,
scraped some of the gilt off the Sydney
Ferries’ gingerbread, there is no reason to
suppose that it isn’t still well gilded; and
the comparative calm with which the recent
increase in the charges for season tickets was
received suggests that the co. has in the
pockets of the people a reserve upon which
it may draw to equalise its dividends and
keep its private stocking well supplied for
contingencies. “A slight increase, in some
instances.” the directors call it—this “slight
increase” being as much as 30 p.c.; and it
wasn’t the first. Still they do it now with-
out a tremor; for the Labor Government
feeds out of the hand, and its nebulous
scheme for nationalising or municipalising
harbor ferries is dead and buried forty
fathoms deep.

Well, they deserved it; for they had been
starved for many years, and will probably
see lean times again. For Australian Govern-
ments, which are this co.’s best customers,
spend money only in spasms. When the
country is prosperous, and private work
plentiful, and money easily borrowed, they
create a boom by going to Cohen for millions,
and splashing it up all at once. The demand
for labor becomes abnormal; and any old
conditions are accepted. Prices then scarcely
count for anything. While this unhealthy
fever lasts, cos. like this one make a heap of
money. Then something happens. It may
be a drought; it may be a war. In either
case the supply of Government loan money
stops suddenly. Labor, which had been
absorbed by tens of thousands in Stale jobs,
has to be knocked off. Then comes the
struggle to pay the interest—a real struggle
because of the wretched value which the
State has been getting, in common with
other people. Cheeseparing economy has,
consequently, to be resorted to, and the
depression becomes as abnormal as the infla-
tion was a year or two before. In its .JO
years Walkers have seen so much of this
that their dividend climbed up to 10 p.c.
with great deliberation; and there was no
sky-rocketty division of surplus profits.
This shows how the management has used
the years of borrow and boom to make itself
snug:—

Assets other than freeholds and
Plant £24,125 £158.215
Liabilities 6,588 58,350
Surplus .. .. £17,537 £99,865
The improvement there is £82,328. From
Ibis must be deducted £5047 of capital paid
in, leaving £76,681 to represent seven years’
accumulation of profits. It does not, of
course, follow that that much net profit has
been made in excess of the dividends, because
the plant may have depreciated. But with-
out having an inventory and other particu-
lars, and being able to swear to it. this paper
ventures the remark that, on account of addi-
tions and improvements, the co.’s plant is
worth every penny as much as it was in
1007. Of the £158,215 of more or less liquid
assets shown above, £51,446 is “invested
funds” and £60.385 is “value of work per-
formed on contracts over and above progress
payments.” and to some extent that is a
matter of estimation. Still, as far as one
can judge. Walker’s, Ltd., isn’t likely to esti-
mate it on the big side. How shockingly the
business fluctuates may be partly seen by
the fact that as at June. 1007. the value of
work done on contract jobs over and above
progress payments was only £2828. The
paid capital is now £82.804. and the co. is in
the comfortable position of having the whole
of it in more or less liquid assets, after pro-
viding for all liabilities. If. then, the worst
came to the worst and the engineering busi-
ness merely paid its own wav and provided
for replacements, there should be 4 p.c. on
the capital from investments alone, assuming
that the money now owing on contracts is
got in and dropped into a safe 4& p.c. or 5
p.c. security.

The time has come for the Wild Cat to
redeem an old promise and leave off scratch-
ing for two minutes while it gives this co.
three cheers. Just 25 years ago R. & W.,
Ltd., started with a capital of £60,000, of
which no less than £57,500 was represented
by paper—the goodwill item. Little by little
profits have been accumulated until now
there isn’t a trace of the old blot left: and
for every £ of the capital there is a full 20s.
of cash, secured advances and other tangible
assets. The list is as follows -
Cash and deposits .. ..£40,976
Advances on properties .. 39,789
Book debts and oddments . . 9,740
Less liabilities . . .. . . 26,833
Net assets (30/6/’l4) .. . . £63,672
Out of that the current dividend and income
tax provision have to be deducted to arrive
at the capital and reserves shown above. In
the past eight years the surplus of liquid
assets over liabilities has grown by £44,683
a tribute alike to the activity of the Sydney
property market during these prosperous
years and to the moderation of the manage-
ment in the matter of dividends. But turn
the thing upside down, and then you’ll see
that if it took only eight years of market
activity to produce an accumulated surplus
of £44,683, it must have taken 17 years
before that to accumulate £18,989. True,
even if the market is knocked out now, the
co. won’t be in its old position altogether;
for even if the advances on properties are
unproductive, the actual cash in hand should
earn £I6OO a year at least. And there never
was a time when the business didn’t earn
something. In 1903, when things were very
bad in Sydney, the profits totalled £3BOI. of
which about £BOO was from interest; and, if
anything like that can be done now, the 7
p.c. will be safe enough—there will be £4600
available in the year. Things may be a lot
better than that; it seems quite unnecessary
at present to expect them to be worse.

This was one of the early floats of the
Sydney boom in industrials ; and there are
only two or three of the fleet; then launched
that have had anything like so good a subse-
quent history. In the first place, besides
having good technical management, it
secured first-class accountancy; and, in a
business of this sort, first-class accountancy
means a lot—there is almost certain smash
ahead of the concern which doesn’t keep
costs sheets or know what to do with them
when it has them. Herbert Priestley’s firm,
figuring now as “supervising accountants”
and formerly as “financial managers,” sees
to that part of Sargents’. Further, in buy-
ing the goodwill and paying a thump-
ing price for it, the co. at any rate bought
also the services of the Sargents who had
made the business. The distressful feature
of the case is that not one penny of the fine
profits, made in these years of extra pros-
perity has been applied to the writing down
of goodwill, which still stands in the
accounts at the old £45,000. Priestley’s
idea is understood to be that the goodwill
is still worth £45,000. The Bulletin’s is
that nobody had a right to assume live years
ago that it was going to be worth £45,000
in 1014. Priestley probably took out an
accident-insurance policy at the beginning
of last year, and ended up on December 31.
a hale man who hadn’t met with any acci-
dent. Yet he knew on Jan. 1 that he had
no right to assume that he would pass
through 1013 without mishap; and he paid
a premium accordingly. The same with
goodwill. When a co. starts it pays a
sum for a business which is liable to acci-
dent and the infirmities of old age ; and its
only proper course is to cover it with an
accident policy. In other words, it ought
to replace the intangible goodwill asset by
something hard and tangible taken out c.f
profits.
Still, if the co. hasn’t done this, it. has
done the next best thing—it has hung on
to a decent amount of profits and put them
into various reserve funds. Certainly it
doesn’t hold any large proportion of them
in cash ; but that is mostly because the
business has grown rapidly and called for
capital. Capital and reserves before the
current div. was paid totalled £142,772, and

Apart from the business as a going concern
a lot of this wouldn’t be worth a great deal;
the value of the plant, etc., and of the
improvements on leaseholds, depends upon
the business running on. If the business
went, not only the goodwill but a consider-
able value in other assets would go too.
There is, of course, no sign of the business
going : on the contrary, the co. is pushing
out further, and never made such a profit
as it did last, half-year. But the people
who run it are not immortal: and if the
men who succeed to businesses were always
as good as those who built the businesses,
no familiar old sign would ever have co
come down. Further, there are businesses
which carry on of their own momentum for
years. Bad management can’t kill them
instantly. But man will stand no trilling
with his sacred victuals. Let them go off,
and lie goes off too. For the present Sar-
gents’ profits are splendid. They may even
be good during the depression ahead of us.
But regarded as an investment the stock
plainly has its limitations.

This co. has almost the whole of the
tug business of S. Aus. in its hands. Not
only the Adelaide business, but that of
Spencer’s Gulf as well. The latter trade
includes the lightering of flux from the Iron
Knob jetty to the Broken Hill ITop.’s works
at Port Pirie, on the other side of the
water; and additions have lately been made
to the plant for this purpose, a steam lighter
having been put in at a cost of £16,761. Yet
even with this cruiser bought and paid for
the co. has made so much profit in excess, of
the dividends that the cash position has im-
proved very much in the past few years.
This shows how :
1906. 1914.
Assets apart from tugs and plant.. £17,384 £30,345
Liabilities 2,431 913
Surplus £14,953 £29,432
Meantime a hulk or two have been either
scrapped or got rid of, and the dozen steam-
tugs and launches are not as young as they
were; nevertheless the equipment has been
well looked after, and. exclusive altogether of
the steam lighter, it is probably worth very
little less than it was eight years ago. As
the profit figures show, the business is liable
to severe fluctuations, largely dependent, of
course, upon S. Australia’s erratic seasons.
The last season was generally poor in the
wheat districts; and this, no doubt, accounts
for most of the shrinkage in last half-year’s
income. The experience is bound to recur
at intervals; yet in good or even average
times the profit is so greatly in excess of the
10 p.c. dividend requirements that share-
holders are not justified in taking a gloomy
view of their prospects. In eight years
their business has paid for extensive plant
additions, maintained a dividend averaging
a shade over 10 p.c., and put by in hard cash
an amount nearly equal to one-fourth of the
entire capital; and a co. which can do that
and see no reason to expect any serious
change, may reckon itself on an extra-good
wicket.

This is another of the excellent institutions
with which Ballarat supplies itself with
home-made sweets. Its paid capital, as with
practically all trustee concerns, is small in
comparison with the amount of business
done, and also with the size of the author-
ised capital. Of an authorised £160.000 in
£2 10s. shares, only £20,000. representing
£1 per share on 20.000 shares, is paid. Of
the uncalled balance on the issued shares
£1 ss. stands as a reserve liability, designed
for the protection of clients in the last resort.
Besides the capital, there are £17,750 of
reserves; and of the aggregate £37,756 of
capital and reserves £35,290 is in public
securities and cash. Yet, though its money
is. in this class of gilt-edged investment, the
co. is able to show a profit equal to over 9 p.c.
on the shareholders’ funds. Ten years ago
the value of the trust estates in hand was
£981,021 ; now it is £1,817.893, or almost
double. Which proves two things—(l)
that people are very properly deciding in
favor of the professional trustee, who is a
fixture, rather than the private trustee who
isn’t; and (2) that this co. has a firm
hold on the confidence of the local public
who should know it last.
The prospectus of Motor-bus Services. Ltd.,
published in Sydney on August 1, has fallen
on particularly evil times for the success of
Arthur Bercival Freeman's venture. A
similar prospectus appeared in Adelaide two
months ago, and was promptly blown upon
by 11. V. McKay, the representative in Aus-
tralia of the London General Omnibus Cos.
and the Daimler chassis car; and the same
thing has happened in Sydney. The advt.
of Arthur IVreival Freeman, being headed
by a staggering announcement of the rises
in L.G.O. Cos. shares during the past five
years, might suggest to the artless investor
that the Benz motor-buses which Mr. Free-
man proposed to import from Germany are
identical with the 7500 vehicles that have
earned enormous profits for the London co.
Asa matter of fact, the Benz ’bus appears
to be unused by the L.G.O. Cos. In any
case, Freeman’s dream of profits must have
already vanished in war smoke.

As there is no hope of the early revival of
the wool sales, and as shearing is about to
start in N. 8. Wales, the selling brokers have
issued a circular inviting growers to store
as much of the clip as they can at their sta-
tions. For one thing, it. is believed they will
be able to get larger insurance cover that
way; for another, the Sydney wool-stores,
though enormously added to of recent years,
wouldn’t be capable of holding a whole
season’s clip. Obviously, also, the less ex-
pense the growers incur for railage, etc., the
less demand they will need to make on the
banks, and the more of the latter’s resources
will be available in other directions.
* * * *
For the present they are tiding over the
trouble at Broken Hill by undertaking to
work half time ; but even this will mean a
rapid accumulation of stocks. When Britain
and her allies get command of the seas
the Australian market for foodstuffs will be
fairly right again; but it is the particular
misfortune of the Broken Ilill mining in-
dustry that Germany and Belgium take
practically the whole of the lead-zinc con-
centrates not smelted in Australia, and Ger-
many and Belgium have other fish to fry at
present.
* * * *
The Broken Hill men call on the Govern-
ment to work the mines if the cos. won’t.
This is merely harassing a Government
which is very harassed already. If the men
will take their pay in lead and zinc con-
centrates, well and good. The thing can
be easily managed then. But if they want
money, then they may as well settle down
to the hard fact that the State Government
can no more make it than the mining cos.
can. In ordinary circumstances when a
State Government hasn’t got money and
needs some badly, it borrows. At present
that is out of the ouestion. So the sugges-
tion that the trouble would be ended by
the Government taking the mines over tem-
porarily is merely a childish evasion of the
principal difficulty.
* •* * *
Royal-Commissioner B. R. Wise. K.C., is
still wandering at large among the many
branches of Broken Hill mining. At latest
lie was hearing about one of the local
Miners’ Association’s quaint little ways.
Whenever a fatal accident occurs in a mine
that mine is shut down for 24 hours, so far
as the ass. is concerned. This isn’t done. it.
is explained, out of respect for the dead or
anything of that kind, but wholly and solely
to teach the co. to be careful. The co. may
have been entirely blameless ; but that doesn't
matter—it ought to be more careful all the
same. Weir, the employers’ representative
who is assisting the Commission, suggested
that every time the Sydney tramways killed
a citizen the citizens should refuse to ride
in the trains for 24 hours. It might be awk-
ward for them sometimes. But see how
careful it would teach the tram people to be!
Naturally. Wise has given the union the
straight tip to drop the practice, quick and
lively. But that’s not to say that it will be
dropped. The A.M.A. at Broken Hill isn’t
a body that thinks a “silvertail” lawyer can
teach it anything.

Melbourne Cope’s Creek (N.S.W.I came
through its half-year ended June 30 with a
debit balance of £.1072. No. 1 plant was
idle for three months, producing oulv 6 tons
7cwt. of concentrates: and No. 2 plant
handled 64.600 cub. yds. of washdirt for a
yield of 304 tons. The average pans out
1.0581 b.. costing 10.53 and. per yd. The aggre-
gate cost of tin concentrates was over £OO
per ton : and the market won’t stand that
Cope’s Creek Central for its half-vear made
a net profit of £3307. and two dividends of
Is. each took £3OOO. equal to 40 p.c. on
capital. The market has. however, gone to
pieces, and this and other Cope’s Creek
mines are to be hung up until selling con-
tracts can be arranged again.
Boulder No. 1 is thinking of buying off
the tributors on its Ivalgoorlie lease. Years
ago the co. gave up all nope of ever making
money out of the show, and removed the
best part of the plant to a lease at Magnet.
The shift proved disastrous, and now the
co. has come to the conclusion that the old
place is as good as any. Most of the shoots
picked out by tributors have been short
and narrow, hut one worth about 12dwt.
over 6ft. was recently exposed; hence, no
doubt, the co.’s anxiety to get back again.
Chairman G. P. Doolette mentioned at the
annual meeting that every effort had been
made during the past year to tind anew
property, but without success. The cash in
hand amounts to £BOOO.
Mary Mac’s tributors (W;A.) took 4208
tons out of the Lady Harriet during the
seven months ended June MO, and crushed
£10,745 from it. The co.’s royalty was
£1340 and the tributors’ profit £7300. The
party remains in the employ of the co., and
is now busy opencutting wlmt the local
paper says is a big body of high-grade ore.
Greenfinch Cos. apparently missed a prize-
packet in the Empress at Lennonville
(W.A.). It had lhe show under option 12
months ago, but after doing a little sampling
it cleared out. Since then nearly £35,000
has.been won. and the last return of £IBOO
came from a depth of 260 ft., where the reef
is said to have widened and to carry visible
gold.
* * * *
At the Fingall meeting C. A. Moreing
said that in the last three years over
£223,000 tons of accumulated residues had
been reground and treated for a profit of
£10,617. or 114 and. per ton. Various small
accumulations near the old mill had also
been scraped up, and the proceeds had added
a bit to the co.’s funds. He quoted from a
recent report by geologist Ur. Maclaren to
show (1) that recent operations at depth
have shown no geological changes or
given any indication that any are to be
expected; (2) that the factors that led him
on his first inspection of the mine in 1610
to anticipate a recurrence of ore in depth
have been in no wise modified; (3) that
the marked increase in the value of the ore
disclosed towards the north end of the No.
18 level is a most hopeful indication of a
general improvement in depth. lie adds
that, generally speaking, the old auriferous
lode has been so shattered by movements
and so completely impregnated by barren
white quartz that its gold is scattered more
than it was; but there are occasional lengths
south at the Nos. 16. 17 and IS levels along
which the old auriferous dark quartz has
been frozen either to one or the other wall,
generally the footwall, and has escaped in-
corporation with the white quartz. Some
of these, he thinks, may yield small shoots
of ore and should certainly be examined.
* * * *
Great Boulder’s hope of ever getting its
lode back from the Golden Horseshoe is
dwindling more and more. At 2630 ft. the
ore body was only 15ft. inside the Horse-
shoe boundary, but at 2600 ft. it is 65ft.
clear. Thus in the last 270 ft. of depth it
lias been thrown 50ft. further west, and
looks like underlaying still further in that
direction. At 2780 ft. it assays 565. 6d. for
a width of 16ft. in the crosscut, and at
2600 ft. the value is 765. 6d. over 15ft. Apart
from this brightening of Horseshoe’s
prospects, several enrichments have been
uncovered in the Nos. 2 and 3 lodes during
the past year. These are in the south end
of the mine, from 1300 ft. down to 2000 ft. ;
and though a lot of ore treated in the last
12 months has been extracted from. them,
they are expected to be shortly at their best.
Winzes to connect the leyels in which these
enrichments have been opened up have been
or are being sunk, and mill supplies of
a much better grade than those which the
co. has bad to use up during the past three
years will soon be available for the mill.
* * * *
Kalgoorlie mine owners have been con-
sidering what will happen if the war isn’t
ended quickly, and have come to the con-
clusion that the price of mining requisites
must soar. Most of the big cos.’ stocks are
sufficient to last for months, after which
things would begin to look serious.. Large
quantities of explosives and cyanide are
imported direct from Germany, but some of
the cos. get their supplies direct from Eng-
land ; and the position with regard to explo-
sives is awkward, because these goods, or
some of them, are contraband.
* * * *
Allan Stoneliam, of London, who had very
little money when he struck Westrafia in
1864. and has now quite a quantity, has for-
gotten the base means by which he did
ascend. Speaking at a meeting in London
of the Kalgoorlie Electric Tramways Cos., he
remarked that he “did not see much chance
of a mining revival. Few people in London
were foolish enough to provide money for
Australian mines, in view of the tremendous
wages demanded by the Labor party.” Mr.
Stoneham and his friends extracted ' the
high-grade ore of Kalgoorlie and shipped the
proceeds to London, after paying a wage
ridiculously unequal to the value of ore
mined. Now that ounces have gone down to
dwts. he would like wages to shrink in the
same way. It isn’t high wages that is
wrong with Australian mines, Imt over-
capitalisation. hot-air shares and market
ringing, which 4oz. ore could carry and
lOdwt. ore cannot look at. Anyhow, one
Australian miner is of more real value to
Australia than a hundred Stonehams talking
inaccuracies in Austin Friars and St.
Switliin’s-lane.

HOW I RUBBED AWAY A STONE OF
FAT FROM MY HIPS AND ABDOMEN
IN TWO WEEKS’ TIME.
For years I tried every possible means to
hide the excessive fat on my hips and
abdomen, it seemed as if it had accumulated
on just the two places that it would be most
noticeable. Everything that I tried failed to
make me any thinner. But thanks to a lady
friend who had studied herboristerie. I
learned the secret of a harmless plan which
enabled me to rub away with ease a stone
of useless fat in only two weeks.
The plan is so simple and- some of my
friends seem so glad to know of it that I
Ihink there may be sister readers of the
Sydney Bulletin who have perhaps been
longing for this very advice. First, get
from any good chemist 1 dram of quassia
chips and 3 ounces of cirola bark extract.
Take them home and, after putting the
quassia chips in a pan, pour over it a tea-
cupful of boiling water. When this has
stood for about a minute, strain through a
cloth and add the cirola bark extract. Then
pouf the mixture into a bottle and apply
it every night and morning with your hands
for about ten minutes, -using a circular
movement. Each time you can almost see
some of the fat melt away. At first I
thought it must be a dream, but when I
measured there was no longer any doubt. 1
soon grew too slender for my clothes and had
to have them taken in, but it was a pleasure
lo do it, and I shall feel eternally grateful
to the lady who showed me how easy it was
to regain my youthful figure.—E. L. A.*

A GRAND SPIRIT
A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 30, 3014.
My Dear Akini, : —
The lion, sec., Red Cross, e/o St. John
Ambulance Association. Equitable Buildings,
wishes to make a special appeal for medical
comforts and clothing. These are for Aus-
tralian troops either in the expeditionary
forces or for those whose defence of our own
shores may begin any moment. Write to the
address given for further details.
Iland-knitted socks for soldiers are among
the rush items of the war. Also boots would
come in handy, and almost anything except
strong drink. Enthusiastic knitters, whose
ivory needles clicked furiously during the
South African war, tell me that the most
comfortable sock —it’s a stocking to the knee,
really, with a firm turn-over top—is made
without heels. This suggests a bare patch of
male foot rubbing against the hack of the
boot in a large blister. But it’s nothing of
the kind. The sock that Tommy Atkins is
looking for is made in a long, narrow bag.
with the toe-piece as the only shape it pos-
sesses. Tommy rushes his feet into these
goods, just as Max Adeler rushed little Alex-
ander to the cemetery, and puts his heels
where so disposed, pulling up the legs with
a calm sense of well-being. Instead of try-
ing to crowd his corned soles into all sizes
in socks, this cute arrangement fits every
shape in bunions on the march. Knitters
please forward their wares to the Women’s
Club. Stanway House, King-street, city. A
committee of busy bees in the above hive is
taking over the sock war counter to relieve
the central Red Cross organisation.
The League of Girl Aids has again been
patted and rubbed down at Government
House, in view of the present state of War’s
alarms. The meeting there the other day
hurled appropriate remarks re the Uses of
the Young Person who can cook without
killing a sick man, and bandage him hard till
he cries for mercy. More cash for the
League was the object of the recent rally.
Dr. George Lane Mullins is already bringing
discipline to bear on the Girl Aid, who is
made to understand she can only throw out
her chest and present saucepans under the
command of the Red Cross authorities.
While inevitable female advertisers are
hurling themselves to the front—-the draw-
ing-room front —hundreds of busy women
are quietly sharpening their needles for the
fray. The Double Bay ambulance classes
had to call in extra experts to hold the rush
of bandages at bay. Mrs. James Ashton
is one of the persistent prodders of this first-
aid show. Mrs. Danger Owen, another prac-
tical dame who is given to deeds rather than
words, is rounding up a Wool]ahra contin-
gent for active service by the domestic
hearth. This form of warfare consists in
making or bushranging or briganding or
pirating on the high seas cardigan jackets,
jerseys, pyjamas, shirts, vests and every
confortable rag. the Man in Khaki is likely
to want.
The Dnfault concert in the Towm Hall on
Saturday eve had a wildlv-enthusiastic
crowd ready to cheer every item in the pro-
gramme. Allitsen’s “The Lord is My
Light” made the rafters ring when the
silvery-topped tenor hurled his voice against
the line —“Of whom then shall I be afraid?”
Fiddler Ernst Toy and soprano Pauline
Bindley lent their aid to the evening’s per-
formance. while Jacques Pintel was firmly
entrenched at the piano. The climax was
Ihe Marseillaise, with the National Anthem
as the last word before the lights went
out.
Commander Robins. R.N., has jumped,into
some kind of useful billet on Garden Island,
during the present uproar in Europe. His
resignation from the Stricklands’ staff, how-
ever, was a pre-war affair. The married
A.D.C., with only a snack of naval half-pay
to back up the £3OO a year _ which the
wealthy bachelor can toss about in cigars for
himself and chocolates for his lady friends,
has a stiff row to hoe. The cleavage has
been an amicable business. The capable
Robins has been searching for another situa-
tion for some time. There’s more gilt than
gingerbread in the Help Department, take
it all round.
The buckling on of warlike belts and the
hurried packing of swords, topboots and mili-
tary swags whirls Captain Wallis off the
Government House map. His regiment was
stationed at Gibraltar. If it is still waiting
on that important crag, a rush of business
may be safely predicted during the next
month or two.
Colonel Jack Antill is a busy man in these
stirring times. He is to be found under the
big clock in Victoria Barracks at certain
hours allotted to the rush of volunteers for
enrolment. The rush is so prodigious that
about SO per cent, of the younger male popu-
lation is almost breaking its way into the
official den to record its name and address
and its passionate desire to hit something.
Thank goodness, our poets are still left for
home defence.
Our Nicest Girls, with Miss Mary Strick-
land as president, are flinging off frivolities.
They are tackling the business of the hour
with a spirited notion of being Helps in time
of trouble. The Young Person in our Best
Suburbs is solemnly pledging herself to
knock off gauds and little luxuries, and
spend her pocket money on the Man behind
the gun. Florence Nightingale is looking
up, and Joan of Arc is booming, and the
Maid of Saragossa might be floated into a
company these days with 50,000 cumulative
7 r per cent, preference shares. The
Young Person of the suburbs now
sends forth her ultimatum to every
other girl in N.S.W. to fall into line.
The headquarters staff in Sydney will
also joyously acknowledge contributions to
the store of comforts they are heaping up
for those who may temporarily feel the
pinch of poverty in this State. Will girls
in remote districts note the idea of form-
ing groups in committee to receive local
offeringsV These they can then forward to
the central secretaries.. The latter now give
their hand and seal as .Joyce Allen. Merioola.

Excellency Helen M. Ferguson opened
the annual show of Arts and Grafts a few
hours before she flitted off to Melbourne.
In a voice so carefully pitched that the last
unit in the crowded rooms heard her wise
words of advice, she addressed the meeting..
Not since the days of Lady Northcote ,has
the local citizeness listened to a better ora-
tion from feminine officialdom. Private-
secretary Luttrell remained neutral, and
took up a commanding position in the rear
of the enemy—l mean the battalion of
Women. James I. called it the Monstrous
Regiment of Women, but then lie had bow
legs and seldom washed.
The R. A. Society’s rooms, where the
Arts and Grafters are still showing theil 1
exhibits, is in the same old place, Vickery’s
Chambers. Take the lift or anything else
you can put your hands on, if the committee
is looking the other way. Mrs. Baronet
Cooper, who is a vice-president of the
society, showed some fine bead necklaces,
made on a tiny hand-loom. This work,
which is like a delicate mosaic on a gold
ground, caught tin' approving glance of the
National Gallery Trustees, who were lurk-
ing on the premises. The results go into
the Arts and Grafts coffers. The trustees
spent about £lOO on exhibits. Rhoda
Wager, a comparatively new arrival from
Scotland, sold to the gallery a lot of art
jewellery, including a blister pearl ring fit
for a nabob. Mildred Creed, S. C. Sawyer
(Brisbane) and Emily Leist were also head-
lined in glass cases, “Bought by Trustees.”
Ada Newman, a china painter of local note,
had a lustre vase with a faint fantasy in
poplars, marked with the same imposing
notification. Victoria E. P. Allen snatched
first prize for a stained-glass design. Eirene
Mort was strong in original designs—notably
for a first prize notion of majolica tile
decoration. Ethel Fovegrove and Madeline
King rushed to the fore in the design sec-
tion. Gertrude S. Kinsr. with an oak
mantelpiece carved in Norfolk Island pines,
deserved something better than third prize.
Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, whose homestead
is at Yarraford, in New England (N.S.W.).
are in Britain on a holiday trip. They
intended making a stay in Yorkshire —
amongst the moors and the memories of the
Bronte family—when the last mail left;
London.
Solicitor Barry, of the Sydney firm that
includes as partner lawyer O. E. Norris, was
on the European continent a few weeks ago.
lie may still be there. The continent is a
hard place to get out of.
The musical Grimsley family of Woolwich,
which may be located at every concert of
note in this town, has a daughter studying in
Germany. Possibly the girl got away before
that Kaiser-ridden country took on Europe
in mortal combat, for the rumbling of the
storm has been notified for weeks.
The concert in aid of the Twilight House
for old ladies filled the Arthur Allens’ ball-
room with the most expensive millinery of
the season. The company paid one guinea
each for the use of a chair in that elegant,
palm-trimmed apartment, from four to five
p.m.. the other afternoon. Having nerved
itself to this sacrifice, it handed out another
2s. per head to attack light refreshments
after the event, in an adjacent eyrie. Mrs.
Allen’s sporting offer of Merioola premises
for the Cause will push a solid cheque into
the Twilight House coffers, and assist that
still illusive castle in Spain or Mosinan to
gather a few more bricks together.
Mrs. Alex. Gordon, one of the lion. secs,
for the Merioola charity show, warbled
sweetly in French, with an encore in Eng-
lish. The latter was much appreciated by
"Amongst Those Present.” (N.B. —This
portion of any entertainment is supposed to
receive a foreign language in stunned
silence.) Muriel Starr and Eric Maxon
were interesting in a piquant dia-
logue sketch. They stood (for shelter, of
course) under a large umbrella, as the scene
occurred on a wet afternoon in London. So
a fine day in Sydney had to look as damp as
it could under the circumstances. The moral
of “A Christmas Present” need not be men-
tioned in headlines, for it was dead against
Ella Wheeler Wilcox and Felicia ITemans’
best efforts. Society heard, through its
veil, the muffled truism that the Nice Woman
has a life of stodge and the Hussy gets all
the bouquets. Derek Hudson, Elsie Spain
and Jack Cannot were on loan from the
J.C.W. firm. Laurence Godfrey Smith came
to blows with the piano, which seemed to
suddenly break something in its middle, and
tinkled wildly to the end of the argument.
Mrs. Wesche and Mrs. Geoffrey Fairfax
were lion, treasurers for this expensive show.
Mrs. Hugh Ward beamed under one of the
new pancake hats. Macarthur Onslow,
M. called unon all present to sing the
National Anthem before the meeting raided
the refreshments. This was done with great
vigor, in quite 120 different keys.
Lieutenant Commander Vaughan Lewis.
R.N., a line, strapping young naval sprig
on our own Australia, was married to Miss
Georgia Neild, a few hours before the big.
grey craft slipped out of port. Tho. pretty
bride had no fancy trimmings to the quiet
wedding, and was handed over to her tar
by her tall, handsome mamma with as little
fuss as possible. A brother and a friend or
two witnessed the knot-tying by Parson
'Wentworth Shields. The late Senator J. C.
Neild, the girl’s father, was once a familiar
figure in militia circles as Colonel of the
St. George’s Rifles. Incidentally lie once
orated for nine consecutive hours iu the
N. Assembly, and his moustaches were
wonderful.
Sir Oliver Lodge, who claims to have
pierced the shrouded aura beyond the ken
of ordinary science, is going to stay at the
•Tames Fairfax mansion on Bellevue Hill
during the peaceful British invasion of this
hamlet. His wife and two daughters will
be fed and housed at the same address as
their psychological relative.
The marriage of Miss Ruth Hangar to
Commander Lewin, R.N., of the Encounter,
was hurried along in view of the early
departure of the gunboat on urgent business.
The groom used to be in charge of our train-
ing hulk Tingira, which is turning outsmart
bluejackets for home consumption. The
popular bride is a daughter of Henry Dan-
gar, M.L.C., of the pastoralist family whose
flocks are white on many N.S.W. plains.
Miss Ruth Hangar is a grand-daughter of
the late Commander Lamb, R.N.. who settled
in Sydney as a merchant in 1829.
Mrs. and Miss d’Ebro, of Melbourne,
climbed the steep ascent to Kosciusko —per
motor—a week or two ago. The daughter is
a fine, upstanding girl, who makes a dashing
figure on the snowy landscape. Another Vic-
torian, Dr. R. E. Shuler, is to be found at
the same address, and Dr, Owen, from the
Camperdown district (Vic.), where the pas-
toralist waxes fat in the land, is trying his
skill on skis on the big hillock.
Mrs. Teesdale Smith, whose hubby is
something of weight in the Port Augusta-
Ivalgoorlie railway contract business, is at
the same old mountain as I pen this line.
Guy Davenport, who is reckoned very
swift on snowshoes. is still at Ivossy’s Snowy
hostel, taking a brisk part in the carnival
doings up that way. He is an enthusiastic
Sydney youngster, and a son of the Percy
Davenports of Darling Point. From that
haughty suburb the T. M. Alcocks and Miss
Harris set forth to see the fun, while Kossy’s
bleak old pate looks like a large lump of
cotton wool.
The war may send some of the holiday
makers who were ski-ing at Kosciusko a few
days ago hurriedly back to Sydney. The
Willie Andersons, of this town, were up there
in the John See party. Anderson: jun.. is
a member of a big local naval and military
clothing firm, which is likely to be extra busy
in the present pinch of warlike circum-
stances.
R. J. Fagan, a pastoralist from Sunny
Ridge, Mandurama —somewhere in the Car-
coar country—was up at Kosciusko a few
days ago. (N.B.—lt’s too risky to state
for certain where anyone or anything is
likely to be when this reaches you.) At the
same mount was his Best Girl, the charming
Adelaide damsel. Miss Baird, who was also
included in the 1013 snow revels, up aloft in
Monaro. This engagement, by the way. is
about two months young.
Miss A. B. Spencer, a clever daughter of
Professor Baldwin Spencer, is—or was—
prominent on the white scenery. (1 am try-
ing hard to advertise Kosciusko, not because
Freedom shrieked when the man after whom
it was named fell, but because X.S.W. doesn't
know half so much as it should do about its
one superb mountain patch.) This party
has two German medicoes —Stawell and
Dunhill —ready to render tirst aid if anyone
breaks a hole in the snow with a loud thud.
Miss Moffatt, from the silver-plated suburb
of Toorak, is busy on skis in the same con-
tingent. Miss Spencer’s learned parent, by
the way, remained in Melbourne, to help out
the Victorian committee’s plan of campaign
for giving the British Blue Kooks a good
time.
Arnold It. Mote, who is respectfully fol-
lowed by a procession of letters, B.A. Syd.,
Mus. Bac. Oxon. ct Dunedin, F.R.C.O. (this
will do to go on with), gave an exhibition of
his prowess on the Town Hall organ the
other evening.
Paymaster Thomas, of the Victorian mili-
tary forces, was recently gazetted as Direc-
tor of Administration at the Duntroon Col-
lege for budding soldiers. Mr. Thomas is a
civilian, though lie’s been bumped up from
the position of Hon. Lieutenant to that of
Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel, in the weird
and swift uprising of courtesy titles in this
once peaceful land. (My great ambition is
to have an honorary creditor or an honorary
money-lender. Incidentally, a military man
of my acquaintance told me that he once
knew an honorary private.) There has been
some gnashing of teeth amongst the khaki
clan at this appointment. But I suppose Mr.
Thomas can insist on the military young-
sters cleaning their teeth and not eating
soup with their swords, while something m
the soldiering business puts the kiddies
through their drill.
“E.O’S.” writes concerning recent experi-
ences in the vicinity of Papua and adjacent
isles. “The first view of Moresby is very
disappointing. The hills which a month
before had been emerald green were burnt
and dry looking—anything but tropical....
The town consists of two hotels, five stores
and sundry other buildings, which rambb-
round without any proper direction. There
is a picture show as well, run by a local
publican and fitted with electric lights. . . .
Hoped to see a native dance in one of the
villages, but had to leave before if began. Ii
was a sort of harvest festival and the native
face was painted up under towering plumes
of bird o’ paradise. There is a big fine
and, in addition to the fine, imprisonment is
waiting for anyone who tries to export these
gorgeous tail feathers. . . .The native police-
man wears a neck-to-knee costume, and
lounges round the scenery till a pan. gun
warns him to get indoors to his own quar-
ters. .. .Samarai is the real thing in cocoa-
nut palms, surfed beaches and deep-green
vegetation. Only 80 whites are resident in
the settlement, which is close to water, and
overlooks the pearling luggers which anchor
close to the little township.... Paid a visit
to an adjacent cocoanut plantation, where
colored labor was splitting the nut to take
the milky white heart out and dry it in the
sun. As one acre is supposed to be worth
£lO a year, the 000-acre lot we saw must be
a profitable spec....At Woodlark Island, the
school-marm is a Melbourne girl, who gels
£4 10s. a week and quarters. The school
is very large for the size of the attendance
(10 pupils), and the teacher, Miss Honrnan,
has a native boy who does everything for
her, including her darning !”
The British ; Scientists, Avho have failed
upon such stormy times to come and shed
their great intelligence on Australia, are
going to be housed in innumerable
homes. A small overflow will take shelter
in our leading taverns. Consul Von Goes is
going to put up Professor Gunnar Ander-
sen. The Women’s Chatribtio Club (Bligh-
street), holds itself responsible for the home
comforts of Professor Zonia Balter —a lady
Blue Stocking. Governor Strickland is going
to offer hospitality to Professor William
Bateson and his wife and to Sir
Charles Lucas. The learned Bower,
who hails from Glasgow ’Varsity, where he
is in charge of Botany, camps with Professor
Lawson in Macquarie-street. Arthur Dendy,
D.Sc., F.R.S., who bosses Zoology in King’s
College, London, will eat the breakfast chop
with the Haswells at Woollahra Point.
Thomas Holland, a big gun in geology at
Manchester Uni., is to discuss his favorite
hobby as Professor David’s guest at Petty’s
Hotel. Ex-Governor of Fiji, Sir Everard
5m Thurn, is booked for the Arthur Allens’
roomy villa.
A side line in the St. John Ambulance
practice has been going on with frantic
enthusiasm in the Girls’ Guild lair, on one
evening a week. The subject who dropped
her skirt the other night, and revealed a pair
of riding breeches and shapely calves for
demonstration, was hurriedly bandaged more
or less successfully by a herd of young
persons in succession. Then the subject did
her little bit. Kicking vigorously she dis-
lodged most of her strappings, and clearly
demonstrated the necessity of tying up a
wounded limb so hard that the patient-
wouldn’t shed his first-aid if he had visions
in his sleep.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

LAMPS
You have four things to consider when buying
Electric Lamps. They are: Strength, Durability.
Quality of Light, and Current Consumption. On all
these points “ WOTAN” Lamps give most satisfac=
tion, as proved by exhaustive tests. They are
strong, because of the jointless filament of pure
drawn tungsten wire, which ensures long life
because it will withstand a considerable amount of
rough usage and vibration. “ WOTAN ” Lamps
give a brilliant light, but do not tire the eyes und;r
any circumstances.
No lamp takes less current than the “WOTAN,” and
its use will keep down your light bill to the
“ irreducible minimum.”
All first=class Electricians and Dealers stock
“ WOTAN ” Lamps. Ask for them and refuse
substitutes.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 10, 1914.
My Dear Yarrik. —
A great crowd went out. to Caulfield on
Saturday for the big Steeplechase meeting.
Though there are enough governors and
premiers in Melbourne just now to stock a
menagerie none of them went racing. 1
take it that they were emulating the Shire
Council above mentioned. The stewards, in
a pathetic effort to give an appearance of
life to a Vice-Regal reserve which was all
too obviously as dead as the stiffest. horse
that ever lost their patrons’ money, had
filled all the chairs in the box with fat blue
cushions.. To my vividly imaginative mind
the bloated cushions seemed to sit up and
take quite an intelligent interest in the
passing lieges and the small aides de-camp
cushions looked just as if they were absorb-
ing tips and sucking their race-card pencils.
1 got so worked up. finally, that I very
nearly sang the National Anthem to them.
1 am glad I refrained, as I suppose such a
proceeding would have aroused the comments
of disloyalists. Still the thing goes to show
how admirably the cushions filled their posi-
tion.
Byron Moore wandered about pondering
thoughtfully in the depths of his august
whiskers. At least I suppose he was pon-
dering. A man with such whiskers as his
looks as though he were pondering even
when he is under an anaesthetic or dead.
A bleak wind blew and the Best Fed
looked dowdy in baggy fur coats and bashed-
looking hats. Nothing shows the dejected,
worried look of a fashionable woman like
the angle of her hat. 1 have seen a smart
woman start a Cup meeting with her hat on
perfectly straight. Upon her losing ss. it
immediately got out of plumb. It was
further affected after she had dropped a
sovereign. When, during the luncheon inter-
val. she was run over by a motor-car, it
looked as much like a mustard plaster as a
hat, and was worn on the extreme end of
her left ear—a position indicative of misery
in excehis.
There is a very general desire to
be helpful, in a sociable sort of way,
amongst our well-to-do unemployed. Smart
Tooraketty women scarcely looked at (lie
horse parade in the bird cage, but got into
clumps and discussed sewing bees and sock-
making campaigns and nursing clubs and so
on. Aviator Harrison’s bride (she was
Kathleen Prendergast) was to be seen look-
ing solemn to a degree. It is sad to be the
wife of an aviator in war-time.
The prevailing trouble affected each
according to his or her kind. One sassiety
girl was moved to spend insufficient time
on her make-up. She had a daub of white
on her nose and a blur of red on her cheek
that gave her the appearance of a female
clown. Another decked herself in a military
cape and a cocked cap. She also waved her
race-card over her head when the band
played a patriotic air and performed step
dances on the lawn. Whether the management
paid her outright for this performance or
gave her a rebate on her admission money
in consideration of it, I was unable to find
out.
It was a great day for patriotism. A
Frenchman wore a tricolor on the brim of
his bowder hat, and most of the motors in
the paddock had Australian Hags waving
from their radiators. One car had a Union
Jack and an Australian flag. The owner
might have spread the whole collection —-
French, Russian, Belgian; Dutch and Ser-
vian. keeping the Italian ensign in the tool-
box in case of need. How few, by the way,
go to races for the racing! Two sweet,
naive girls were seated near me, and one
murmured to the other. “What a lot of
jumping races there are to-day.” Neither
seemed to appreciate that they were at a
steeplechase meeting.
The excitement over the visiting scientists
is growing as fast as the war news will let
it. The Germans of the party are said to be
delighted with the sportsmanlike and tolerant
fashion in which they are being treated by
all hands. But, as I had the satisfaction of
saying, menacingly, to the public nuisance
who commands the brass band which plays
outside my library on Tuesdays and Fridays :
“Wait till the row warms up a bit.” Mean-
while the State Government is circulating
the glad pasteboard which calls upon the
lieges to meet the foreign high-brows in the
Public Library. The encounter is to take
place on August 17.
One of them, by the way, is Im Thurm —
the knight with the Dutch name who
used to be Governor of Fiji, He is staying
with the Stanleys.
At the other Government House are Sir
Oliver Lodge and his lady and Prof, and
Mrs. Bateson. The Lodge daughters. Norali
and Lorna by name, have shakedowns in the
Quamby Club. Sir Oliver is. as you know,
a perfect whale <m psychical research, and
he is believed to have come here chiefly with
tin l idea of attempting to materialise the
ghost of Freetrade. Failing that he is ex-
pected to try and do something with the
Anti-Socialistic phantom. The G.-G. and
his staff are tremendously interested, and
have placed the famous Haunted Room, where
the spirit of the ruined importer gibbers
weekly, on British mail-days, at the famous
investigator’s disposal.
The job of housing the visiting Thinkers
has been an arduous, and in certain cases an
embarrassing, one. It devolved on Prof.
Spencer. lie was given a list and ordered
to find quarters for the persons who figured
on it. One of those who offered a room in
Melbourne was an absent-minded old bachelor
buried in deep inventive ideas. On him
Spencer quartered an Engineer, named
Zouia Baber, with about half the alphabet
to follow. llow was Spencer to know that
this great engineering expert was a woman,
and a young, unmarried woman at that?
Miss Zonia just had to be found different
quarters. Miss Miehaelis came to the rescue
and motored the lady to her St. Kilda house.
The fancy-dress ball at Her Majesty’s
Theatre promise's to roll, no matter what
happens. For one evening only the dancing
floor will extend from the stage right over
the stalls where the Baldliead sits. It will
happen on August 28, under the skilled
direction of Harry Musgrove (commonly
called The Ghost), who is to be found, tickets
in hand, care of Allans.
Our local Moltkes, Wellingtons, etc., com-
plain that the offer of motor-cars for war
service has not come up to expectations.
Certain indisputably gilded families have
offered to place their whole fleet, with
drivers attached, also themselves, their ox,
their ass, their man-servant, their maid-
servant, their dog and the stranger who is
within their gates, and even their telephones,
at military command. Considering the
awful scarcity of domestic service this tender
of Merely Mary Anne to the Government is
heroic. But a mysterious number of folk
have held off. The reason—so I am assured
by the chauffeur with whom I am “keeping
company,” or “walking out”—is that about
half the bo-motored run their petrol-waggons
on the time-payment system. They just
manage to raise the instalments and the price
of their petrol week by week, and depend
mostly on heavenly help for the garage-
repair-bill. They could not well lend
their cars to be wrecked in warfare,
or peacefully worked to death —there would
be nothing to hand back to the collector,
when the time-payments stopped.
Talking about time-payment motorists
brings to mind their companions in infamy,
the Petrol Beggars. A medico of my acquaint-
ance, who lives on a busy highway, is ter-
ribly pestered by them. They call in shoals, and
“borrow” benzine, at 7s. 4d. per four-gallon
tin. as though it were so much water. And
they never think of being so coarse as to offer
money for the goods, nor do they attempt to
return any of the costly fluid. The doctor
has now decided that he can’t afford to stand
drinks to the cars of total strangers any
further. He has accordingly got in a num-
ber of extra tins. He hands a whole tin to
each beggar, takes the number of his car, and,
if the money is not forthcoming within 24
hours, sends his chauffeur for it, or for a
fresh tin. If this has no effect as regards
checking borrowers, he proposes presently to
add to the requisition loss of chauffeur’s
time and wear and tear of tyres and petrol
occasioned in the business of collection.
Amongst the varied horrors of war is the
sudden cancellation of hops. One far-flung
effect of Kaiser William’s ill-advised raid
upon Belgium is that the 64th Infantry (City
'of Melbourne) have postponed their annual
frivol “indefinitely.” Another that the Naval
Depot Ball, which was arranged for last week,
will not transpire. The frankly-expressed
opinion of the local girl is that Wilhelm has
been overdoing the War-Lord business to the
verge of making a public nuisance of himself.
And can wo blame her?
The Innes-Noads (she is a sister of Spruce
Myth) are terribly concerned because Miss
Joan, of that considerable family, is on her
way to Europe, where the bloodshed is. Hers
is a genuine case of money being a curse.
She packed off to London at two days’ notice,
on the strength of a legacy from Uncle E. E.
Smith, and now her family is wishing to
goodness he had taken his money with him.
Another anguished heart is carried round
by Colonel Appleton, who is censoring our
press cables. The object of his misery is his
daughter Tettie, who was dispatched the other
day on a visit to her relations in Yorkshire.
I have no very clear idea as to what the
parents fear will happen to these young
women. With all the men away, on service
of one sort or another, and the North Sea
swept clear of invasive-minded fleets, their
chiefest peril would seem to me to be death
from boredom.
No more about the war, for the present,
my dear. The office is a seething mass of
press censors, and none of us knows when
lie or she isn’t going to be arrested and
publicly keel-hauled for mentioning that
Benger’s Food is gone up a farthing, or that
the knees of the Boy Scouts are redder than
ever this winter. To write a chatty letter
with the cold eye of a censor fastened upon
one’s back hair is as cheerless as early morn-
ing tea on an ice-floe.
A nice young Melbourne girl lias com-
mitted herself to the task of teaching danc-
ing at the local Asylum for the Blind. The
tuition of young pupils who cannot look
where they are going should be an interest-
ing study. Turkey trot and tango are not
in the curriculum, but the round and round
dances will give the sightless whirlers ample
opportunity to discover their affinities. Hav-
ing formed predilections for certain partners
they will presumably be able to pick them
out by the sense of mutual attraction with-
out speaking a word. Ruby will feel that
the Horace her eye has never lighted on will
ask her for the pleasure of the next waltz,
because they got along so well together to
the Blue Danubian strains. But how about
the poor blind girl who hears her best stepper
giving a rival cat a turn and can’t pass
disparaging comments on her appearance?
It’s good for love to be blind, but blind hate
in a ballroom is denied even the consolation
of w’ondering what he or she can possibly see
in the owner of the other pair of feet.
Mrs. Fred Danby, who was a musician
for fun before she lost her husband, is now
making money out of the art. She has taken
sole command of the feminine orchestra which
plays to the tannin-soaked patrons of a city
chiffon store.
The Askin Fosters, of Gippsland, have
rented the Murray Buckles’ house, “Upton
Grey,” at Malvern, for a time. The idea is
to give their twin girls a chance to see life.
This Foster was an Ormond niece, and
adopted daughter of the late lion. Francis,
who endowed the Working Man’s College.
(.’live Miller and his bride, who were to
have returned to Melbourne this month, have
been detained in London. Mrs Clive (who
was formerly Dorothv Reynolds, of Sydney)
is ill with one of those chills that London
alone knows how T to produce.
Olive, the second Rear-Admiral Bridges
daughter, has been laid up in a private hospi-
tal with a ricked back. She was consigned
to the paternal mansion at Toorak last week,
marked “Convalescent—but Carry with Care
and Use no Hooks.”
Florence Rod way, whose portrait medium
is the pastels so loved in Paris, opens a por-
trait exhibition at the Athenaeum Ilall next
Wednesday. Miss Rodway would probably
be given a chance in the Federal Worthies
Portrait Gallery were she not a woman. As
it is, a lot of men better known as scenic
artists than as portraitists seem to have the
monopoly of the Commonwealth commissions.
A reason given for the passing over of the
brilliant Tasmanian girl is the alleged
destructibility of the ’pastel medium, but
there are pastels in the Sydney Gallery
which are 200 or 300 years old, and they
still appear moderately permanent.
I would fain keep off the war—a subject
which promises presently to grow boresome —
but I can’t. It is productive of so much that
is vital. For example, a daily paper has just
heard from a small inland townlet that the
local “Shire Council has been sitting night
and day since the beginning of hostilities.”
If that isn’t calculated to strengthen the
British Government’s hand, what will?
Gerald Officer, R.N., was rudely disturbed
last week, while casting a weather eye on the
family sheen-run, by a summons to rejoin his
regiment in Ceylon. He was on board an
Orient steamer and away before one could
sing a war song at him —not, to be strictly
accurate, that anyone tried to’sing anything.
Very few people can sing, though a lot of
people think they can.
The Irish National Ball, of great prepara-
tion. fell rather flat, the petty row in Ulster
having gone utterly to pieces before the first
breath of real war. Many a bright-green
Irish speech—the work of weeks—was corked
up, and all the talk was of Empire, unity and
the necessity of kicking the insolent foe good
and hard. I don’t think these Irishmen care
much who they fight, so long as it is someone
vigorous. They are as keen on dealing it out
to the Germans now as they previously were
on getting at one another. Mrs. Maclnerney
was the chief organiser of the emerald affair.
She and her volatile husband had planned a
peaceable trip to England in November, but
the big fighting major is packing his kit for
an earlier trip in view of recent develop-
ments.
The Glaciarium tried to drown war specials
ip revelry on Friday night. The usual
fancy-dress “sets” whirled round and raised
a good pneumonia ice-dust. Snow fell thickly
from the roof with the wadding-flakes caught
by cotton threads. The effect was horribly
dizzying both to skaters and onlookers. One
fair girl lost a silver bag and a sovereign.
Rut the missing articles were the gifts of
the management and the loss was the gain
of a cute Bill Sikes.
Miseha Elman, of Russia, and Goll, of
Germany, flung themselves down side by side
at the Town Hall last week, like a musical
lamb and an harmonious lion, and played the
“Kreutzer Sonata.” The artistic tempera-
ment. knowing little of the passions of race,
can do these things with some ease. They
were not entirely successful, however. Goll
swam through his job at the piano in a
dreamy, smileful and vas-ue fashion, and
seemed to forget the violin. Asa result,
Elman, used to slave-like attention from Ins
accompanist, played.nervously, with pucker
»ttn, h k 8 i««W 1C bro & and thc combined
attack lacked sympathy. Accompanist Ivobn
turned over pages for Goll, and glanced
back with nervous apprehension at his
Master from time to time. When the
“Kreutzer” was finished. and Elman ami
Ivohn collaborated in a concerto, the audi-
ence suddenly realised the advantage of a
trained accompanist. In the midst of everv
other number the house would sit up and
prick its ears at the yells and cheers or
shrieks of extraordinary newspaper sellers.
AH things considered, it was rather cool
ot Mi sell a Elman, after cancelling two of
his concerts at the Auditorium, to show up
in a private box at the King’s on the
“Bunty” first night. Little Miseha. who was
accompanied by Eva Gauthier and attended
by his Hebrew suite, would then have been
fiddling on the Audi, platform but for the
slump in receipts at his concert on the pre-
vious Thursday. His proud spirit seemingly
would brook nothing less than a full house,
so the dearth of bookings in advance had
induced him to stop playing “in consequence
of the perturbed state of Europe,” or words
to that effect. Seeing that “Bunty” had not
stopped playing on account of the perturbed
state of Weelum, the figure of Miseha was
out of place in that box. He ought to have
been on his knees somewhere, praying for
the success of Russia v. Germany or asking
Heaven to intervene.
The war has been a great and sudden
match-maker. On Thursday Miss Byron
Moore was married to Captain Ronald
Stewart Gordon, who had only arrived in
Melbourne by the Malwa three days pre-
viously. He left next day for India, to
which tumultuous spot she will follow him
later.
The Plaza is having a Confetti and Flower
Battle to-night (Thursday), and special
artists are booked to perform the snow
waltz. The dancers will be in fancy dresli,
and £5 worth of trophy will be projected at
the best-lookers.
The Vic. Festival Choir is annomrc'|£
two performances of Coleridge Taylor’s
“Higher warfare”- —ho. “Hiawatha”—on
Monday. 17tli. and Saturday. 22nd. Mary
Conly, Phil Newbury and Horace Stevens
are booked for the solo parts.
Bertha Merfield is rejoicing over two huge
packing-cases saved from the stormy serts.
They contain her pictures that, were hling-in
flic Mural Artists’ Exhibition in London.
They are also forerunners of a big scheme
she has in mind for the competitive design
for the walls of the Commonwealth buildings
in London.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Ambrose Patterson’s show of paintings was for-
mally opened by W. .T. Sovvden at the Society of
Arts’ Rooms on Tuesday. Amongst those who cast
a critical eye on the works were the Brewster Jones,
Mrs. van ' Senden, James Ashton, a sprinkling of
Magareys, Mr. Ilowchin and Mr. Talbot Smith.
The “Mick” Newlands have arrived from South
Africa, and are staying with her people—the Porters
—at Medindie.
The scientists are pouring in hopefully, hut the
war has dimmed their glamor, and the fatted calf that
is being killed looks little bigger than a rabbit. For
example, the Mayor’s Ball is to be merely a recep-
tion and a patriotic concert. Government House has
announced its intention of doing no official entertain-
ing, and private fixtures will be of the unaggressive
order. Not that the visitors will mind, I expect.
But it is rough on the locals who had regarded them
as harbingers of social frivolity and free meals.
On Saturday all hands went to Strathalbyn to
hunt. The Lance Stirlings’ place is within easy
motoring distance of Adelaide, and the day was fine,
which accounted for the big crowd. Amongst the
latter were Mr. George Braund and his sister, the
K. L. Colleys, the Charlie Downers, the H. C. Caves
and the Cecil Brays, Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Bell, the
R. A. Sanders, and the Kenneth Milnes.
The Malwa restored to us Dr. Cudmore and his
wife, who had been cramming as much as they could
into a short trip to England.
Professor and Mrs. Hall, two of the visiting scien-
tists, came here ahead of their official time so that
they might put in a couple of weeks with the
Edward Hawkers at their station near Clare—a slice
of the original Bungaree estate, and some of the
best and most attractive country near Adelaide.
Harold Bauer had bad luck in beginning his
season here just as the worst of the cables began to
come through from Europe. Still, he has made
money. What musician doesn’t in this harmony-mad
city ?
On Thursday .Chief Justice Way came back from
Sydney, as well as might be expected, all ready to
do his duty by the Science Congress. He has” the
nerve of a youth of 20.
E. B. Jones, the South Australian Rhodes scholar
for 1912, has finished his B.A. examination, with a
first-class degree and honors in Physiology, and is
now feverishly pursuing a B.Sc. degree, and a
diploma of Public Health.
A.D.C. Hopwood has gone, via America, to rejoin
his regiment, and Private Secretary Mulholland is
left with the whole of the weight of Government
House affairs on his shoulders. So far, he has come
through the Atlas act with considerable credit.
Yours sincerely.
JOHANNA.

AVhen you look at the 15 p.c. payable on ordi-
nary and deferred shares, before smacking
your lips it is just as well to toss one eye
up to the top line and note that the present
capital represents about one-fifth of the capi-
tal actually paid, the other four-fifths hav-
ing been written off as lost. Asa matter
of fact, it wasn’t all so utterly lost as it
looked at the time. .Provision was, however,
made for this: it was arranged that, if
assets should bring in more than their
written-down book value, the surplus should
be credited to a special reserve created for
the benefit of the deferred and ordinary
shares. (The ordinary shares had been
written down from £5 to Is.) Good times
in Melbourne followed the bad times of
1903-4, when the revaluations were made and
the writing-down was done; and substantial
surpluses have been realised. This shows
the pea under that thimble:—

The directors “believe that the realisation of
the remaining properties at reasonable prices
will considerably increase” the £97,373. The
real estate on hand is now valued at only
£24,417, with £25,355 of other securities in
possession; but the balances owing on pro-
perties sold total £112,493, and, if these
latter transactions are completed, there will
apparently be something to drop into the
fund on their account too. Already there
is enough disclosed surplus to pay up the
deferred shares from ss. to £1 and the ordi-
naries from Is. to 55.; but that can’t be
done, all the shares being fully paid.
Meantime the bank, besides attending to
its undertaking job, uses its own and a little
deposit money in general advance business.

The capital and reserves total £311,805, and
the entire liabilities are £261,959, of which
£138,377 is held liquid; so there is excep-
tional security for the depositors’ money.
Current business is, nevertheless, slow in
coming back to the Deposit and Mortgage
Bank, no doubt because the general public
refuses to regard it as anything but one
of the old wrecks engaged in the mournful
occupation of selling up its battered brass
and copper. It might be a great deal more
than that if it were given the chance.

Not many manufacturing concerns, formed
to put anew thing on the market, have the
luck of (his one. And it is not a patented
thing either. Anybody may make wood
pipes; this co. merely holds a few small
patent trimniings, valued now at £572. The
wood-pipe idea at once appealed to Aus-
tralia. First, this is a country of great
distances; and timber costs far less to shift
than iron or steel. Also, the local production
of iron and steel has been negligible; these
goods are therefore dear, while timber is
cheap. Further, Australia wants things
done in a hurry; and you can make and put
down a mile of wood-pipe while you are doing
only a chain or two with the metal. So, one
way and another, the wood-pipe, dropping in
when the works boom was starting, got big
business at once, and on the very moderate
capital required was paying 10 p.c. within
a year. Further, while that rate has been
maintained, £12,390 of profit has been put
by, wiping out the goodwill and providing a
decent reserve which is used in the business,
lo reduce expense the original works in Syd-
ney have been followed by others in Mel-
bourne and Adelaide; but the plant is so
inexpensive that all told only £28,466 is in
fixed assets, including property. The capi-
tal and overdrafts, etc., amount
to £33,612. On the other side, in addition
to the fixed assets, there is £52,079 in stocks
and £27,831 in book debts and a few sun-
dries. No doubt the bigness of the stocks
and book debts is due to large contracts in
hand with the N.S.W. and S. Aus. Govern-
ments. Prospects, the directors say, are
good. All the same, and assuming that the
wood pipe has come to stay, nothing is much
surer than that (1) public works will not
be long continued at the recent rate, and (2)
contract prices will be cut when money is
harder to get than it has been lately. In
view of the profits in the business, the small
amount of capital required to go into it, and
the fact that it isn’t patented, it seems
fairly certain that nothing but a grave doubt
as to the future has kept serious competi-
tors out of the field ; and if it retains the
field it will only be because the future shows
that the business is one of severe fluctua-
tions.

This co., which owns extensive wharf
accommodation, will most likely be asked
before long to put a price on it. Then there
will be some bartering, and the State will
swallow the property, in accordance with
the Government’s settled policy to own all
wharves and jetties. (And it is a Liberal
Government, too, by the way.) The face
of the accounts is therefore booked for an
early change—unless, of course, something
unexpected happens. It is the co.’s good
fortune that the State moves in that direc-
tion after a reasonably long run of extra-
profitable years. Since the middle of 1911
the div. has been at the rate of 15 p.c.
Before that, though the distribution was
very much smaller, the profit was largely in
excess of the divs.; the idea at that time
was to wipe out a debt of £IO,OOO, which
then remained on the property. The last
of the plaster was stripped off three or four
years ago, and then extensive improvements
to the wharf, etc., were begun. The co. has
apparently written nothing off against de-
preciation of property, but it has paid
for current repairs. If the repairs have not
maintained the property at its old value,
then of course the profits are overstated, and
the reserves are not all actual. There is,
however, no evidence one way or the other
on this point.

But things may not be as bad as a first look
at the last line would lead one to suspect.
During the half-year further considerable
additions, etc., have been made to plant, and
as that item stands now at £13,837, whereas
12 months ago it was only £l3O less, it is
probable that some of the new material has
been paid for out of profit and not charged to
capital. Gas sales for the term were £2366
as compared with £2106 for the corres-
ponding period last year—a satisfactory
increase. This table shows how the
£ s. and. side of the concern has been moving
during the past 10 years:—
1904. 1913. 1914.
Liabilities .. .. £5115 £5364 £3232
Liquid assets .. .. 965 4315 2240
Excess liabilities .. £4150 £1039 £992
Of those £3232 of liabilities £3005 is owing
on mortgage. The improvement in the
decade is thus £3158. Meanwhile the co.
has maintained a regular 10 p.c. dividend,
paid for its new plant, and not neglected
renewals, etc. The only things it now has
to fear are (1) municipal electric light,
which is becoming very popular in country
towns, and (2) the Gas Act, which, however,
isn’t likely to be wholly applied to these
smaller cos. unless they become particularly
rapacious. The fear of it will, however,
keep the dividend from going beyond the
present 10 p.c.

New Salak South (Malay States) does
not seem able to pick the nuts out of the
fire, despite recent optimistic reports of 31b.
ground. Thurston Evans, who was sent
over to lay out a scheme of reorganisation,
deprecated further trifling with the top floor,
where low values and irregular occurrences
prevailed, and advised the Melbourne co. to
make the deeper ground its objective. Like-
wise he urged the remodelling of the works
and the adoption of a programme based upon
a two-stage lift, under which the idle sta-
tionary plant (of similar calibre to the
pontoon one) would have been brought into
use. This meant spending £7OOO. The co.
was still largely indebted to the vendors and
found the money market tight. Weary with
the delay, and seeing a dead-end facing him,
Evans, rather than continue a losing course,
closed down, sectioned the mine off to tribu-
tors, and cabled his resignation. The
Board, faced with the necessity of doing
something rapid, decided to put in a puddler
and continue top-floor working on the
Chinese open-cast system. Plant was duly
installed and started two months ago, but
results filter through very slowly. The
ground is of peculiar character and its value
is difficult to estimate. Between the top
and second floors a deep bed of porphyritic
clay occurs which contains lenticular veins
of “karang,” carrying high tin values. But
as these lenses are small, and as the detritus
on top carries only nominal values, the pro-
position resolves itself into one requiring
economic handling; and hand labor on the
ancient open-cast system is certainly not
in accord with modern ideas. Evans refused
to entertain a scheme of that description
when plant to grapple with the business
on a more advanced method was already at
hand.

Radium Hill, whose mine is up in the S.
Australian mulga, with a laboratory on the
Parramatta (Sydney), has had a small
sample of its goods tested at the National
Physical Laboratory in London. One
remarkable .thing about the new metal is
the tremendous difficulty of determining how
much you’ve really got after you’ve got it.
You can’t assay a sample like you can silver
or lead. The test lot weighed 11.5 milli-
grammes ; and Radcliff, the co.’s young
chemist who has been saturating himself with
radium for seven years past, estimated that
there were 10.5 milligrammes of bromide in
it. The London laboratory cables certifying
to 5.8 milligrammes of metallic radium, equal
to 10.8 of bromide. Now if somebody will
certify that there’s £19.7 of profit per milli-
gramme of bromide, everything will be just
right.
“A Man of the ’Fifties” recalls things :
Every Victorian whose beard is tinged with grey
will remember “Jack” Woods, a civil engineer, who,
in the late ’7o’s, was Minister of Railways. Jack,
who was remarkable for his energy and his disregard
for the supposed privileges of wealth, has been dead
many years, and is buried in the Kew Cemetery, near
Melbourne. In 1887 he was in full bloom in the
Assembly, and in the spring of that year one of the
chaps who wrote the sketches of Parliament for a
Melbourne paper had this: “When the Lalor Grant
Bill was tackled in committee, the Opposition made
a gallant resistance, but had to cave in at last....
Mr. Woods was the chief opponent of the measure
in committee, and he was full of blood-curdling
narratives of the early digging days when Peter
Lalor fought at Eureka. Mr. Woods was on the
Goulburn diggings, where, by diplomacy and 1500
men, he secured a reduction of licenses from £1 10s.
to 10s. This arrangement was clinched by Mr. Lalor
at Eureka. Surely, when Woods leaves Parliament, he
should have a big grant, and, when death gathers
him in, a tombstone with the inscription:—
Statesman, yet friend to Truth 1 Of soul sincere,
In action faithful and in honor clear;
Who broke no promise, served no private end,
Who gained no title and who lost no friend.
Mr. Woods wanted to increase the grant, others*
wanted to reduce. The Bill was, however, passed
through all its stages.” Now, after 22 years, jack
Woods’s widow a few days ago has had engraved
upon his tombstone in Kew Cemetery the lines
writen by “Censor,” in the long ago: “Statesman,
yet friend to truth” ! etc.
The Woman in Parliament.
“0.K.” discourses :
In the equipment of the Australian Parliament
House, at Canberra, provision will be made for the
probable election of women to the Legislature, and
the certainty that they will require sex-distinction
arrangements when they get there. Whether the
she-M.P. be fully or insufficiently provided for, time
will show. lam afraid that the plans as to dress-
ing- and retiring-rooms do not presuppose a mingling
of the sexes, in which women would form the
majority of the mingle, and Ministers would be
mostly female, with permanent departmental mascu-
line heads. But let that pass. The point is that
women are expected to enter the Legislature sooner
or later, but that nobody has considered the possi-
bility of the more numerous sex assuming control of
the national circus. A wave of suffragettish feeling
sweeping the country would soon be up against the
question whether man has really granted political
equality to his mother, or has fixed, at the back of
his mind, a limit to her political freedom and liberty.
The sexes are not less mutually antagonistic in some
respects than mutually attractive in others, and the
supposition that woman’s influence in politics could
never, under the recently-changed conditions, be more
than a leaven to lighten the whole lump, is clearly
illogical. Why should women rest content with a
trifling, negligible representation such as the Maoris
are granted in the Parliament at Wellington? The
election of one Vida Goldstein must inevitably open
the door to more Vidas, for if her frank appeal for
sex support wins a sex response, and she “makes
good” in the sex’s estimation, why not battle for
logical majority-rule in the form of Government by
women for women (and men), instead of submitting
to government by men for men (and women), as in
the past and present. The question would be evaded
if it were asked —but it never is asked —by those
men who display themselves on a Vida Goldstein
platform and profess their desire to have the atmo-
sphere of Parliament “purified” by the introduction
of the woman element. They tacitly suggest that
just a little woman element would suffice to purge
Parliament of its grossness, whereas purification, in
all things, is a process which never can be carried
too far. The sinner cannot be too much spiritual-
ised when he is qualifying himself for the Kingdom
of Heaven, and if any woman is needed for the “re-
finement” of a Legislative Assembly and Senate, a
lot of women would, by the same token, make parlia-
mentary heaven on earth. Are men in general pre-
pared to give the fair sex, so called, a chance to
exercise its sense of fairness in making laws for
mankind, and, if not, what is the fair sex going to
do in that galeret The natural correlative of a lady
M.P., elected on the sex ticket, is a lady Premier.
Every private member should carry a Premier’s baton
in his or her knapsack. Is the Commonwealth pre-
pared to accept the idea of a feminine third party
in the House —a sex-elected Caucus holding the
balance of power between Liberalism and Labor, and
prepared to fuse with either party under the leader-
ship of Lottie and Tottie? “Women are the joke
of the world,” snarls Adela Pankiiurst, ere going
on to state that she is used to being laughed at.
But this sermon is not jocularly meant. It treats
of a matter which has got to be taken seriously by
the rising generation. In fact, it is a sermon
addressed to young men.
♦
“Jeames” on a threatened visitation: —
The Night Club steadily approaches Australia. I
can almost hear the crash of breaking bottles and
the howls of over-festive youths as they are pro-
pelled from the ballroom by skilled chuckers-out —
to slightly paraphrase my revered mentor, Bright. I
forecasted it in The Bulletin some two months ago,
and the intimation that the J. C. Williamson Cos.
intends to run a Covent Garden ball in Melbourne
on the 28th instant, and yearly thereafter, consider-
ably fortifies rue in my view. A night at a Covent
Garden ball is indistinguishable from a night at a
Night Club in most of the essentials. There are the
same riotous young men and the same friendly, con-
vention-spurning girls; the same horrible drinks, the
same uneatable suppers, and the same vast army of
tip-chasing waiters. It was held to be axiomatic,
in my young days, that the man who went sober
to a Night Club, unless with the object of borrowing
money, was a fool. He was bound to feel as miser-
ably out of it as though he had gone, well oiled, to
a Sabbath afternoon meeting of Methody Elders.
The same rule applied to Covent Garden balls —and I
have no doubt still does. These balls begin at mid-
night, in order to give the chorus-girls, who are
among their mainstays, a chance to come along.
Several widely different classes patronise them. Tn
the first place there are those who go in fancy dress
to win prizes. They are mostly theatricals. Then
there are the demi-mondaines, most of whom spurn
fancy costumes and wear ordinary evening dress. In
close association with the Lost division are the more
raffish men-about-town, married and otherwise. In
the boxes are those who are too respectable to dance.
From time to time the long, low wail of a woman in
acute mental distress emerges from behind the cur-
tains —at least it would were not Londoners singularly
self-restrained. The cry signifies that some unhappy
wife, who is having an evening out with an admirer,
has detected her husband —allegedly in the distant
Midlands buying Manchester goods—fairly oozing
alcohol on the floor-space, in company with a palpable
hussy. And the peace of yet another British bread-
winner is permanently blasted. These disillusion-
ments are painfully common at Covent Garden. The
Bal de I’Opera in Paris is much the same, only rather
more so. It goes with a far greater swing. This, in
my opinion, is not due to the fact that the French-
man is less self-conscious, and hence readier to make
a public ass of himself than the Englishman, but
to the circumstance that the Gaul gets drunk much
quicker. Broadly speaking, a Fancy Dress Carnival i»
a success in proportion as it is hilariously unsober.

“THE TOPNOTCH SCOTCH.”
RING
GEORGE IV.
WHISKY.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
Gilgandra (N.S.W.) owns a man so
brittle that the other day he scored a broken limb
for the 38th time. The last accident happened as
simply as most of the others. He was out riding',
when the horse of a companion got out of hand, and,
rising in his stirrups to seize the reins, he let his
weight fall on one leg, which snapped. He has a
son who, although only seven —at which age bones
usually resemble jelly rather • than crockery—has
already scored six breakages.
ELOQUENCE.
McGINTY (of the deputation for improved railway traffic to Bullocky Flat): “And I say
that it's a disgrace, so it is, to have the traffic hung up this way, with iviry
farmer in the country literally hungerin' and thirstin' for artificial manures."
“N. or M.” : The remarks of “Pick” on tlie
domestic arrangements of his friend the magpie (B.
25/6/’l4) remind me that the swallow can plant his
adobe villa in queer corners, too. Sometime ago a
couple set up housekeeping on one of the ferry
steamers plying between Hobart and Bellerive, and
brought up a family successfully, though the nomadic
habits of their home must have been a bit of a worry
until they got used to them. During the busy part
of the day-the steamer would be at the wharf only
15min. in every hour. But the parent-in-waiting
kept his eye on the clock, and turned up regularly,
bulging with food for the youngsters.
“Moana”: Par. (R. 25/6/’l4) mentioning
how necessity (which is mostly unimproved land
tax) has caused the development of a new agricul-
tural implement in the shape of the swamp plough
of Maoriland, reminds me that another local inven-
tion has been hoisted out down at the southern
end of lOU Land, to deal with the great areas of
swamp that exist in that part. This is the drain
plough. It consists of a. strong frame running on
three or four wheels with wide tyres. In the centre
of the frame there is a strong steel knife from six
to eight feet long, with a special coulter on the
lower end of it. This knife and coulter can be
screwed down by means of mechanism on the frame
into any soft, swampy ground until the coulter is
from six to eight feet below the surface. Then
about 10 horses, or the wire rope of a stationarv
traction engine, is hitched on to it and it is draggcil
up the swampy ground from the lowest to the
highest point. The action of the coulter down
below forms a very efficient drain if the cut is made
the right way. These drains are made every few
yards, and a great amount of country can be covered
in a day, especially with a traction engine. “Drain-
ploughing,” as it is called, is quite an art, and a
man with a special plant can make good money at
it. Also, through this ingenious device, thousands
of acres of good swampy country have been brought
quickly and cheaply under cultivation.
* * * *
“Oatsunweet” : In the midst of all this
nebulosity about “town planning” I beg to move the
formation of a society for the promotion of country
planning. A lot of amiable people are much con-
cerned, or pretend to be, about the architecture of
the suburbs, the air space provided for each house,
the size of rooms, backyards and so forth. Worthy
objects, no doubt. My concern is about our old
friend, Cocky. The houses which shelter people in
town and city are often enough frowsy-looking dens,
but there are at least, exceptions, and, generally
speaking, the artisan has a fairly sound home. But
Cocky—good Lord! Thousands of him, nearly all
of him, hang out in miserable hovels, broken-down
shanties, uninviting sties. Nine out of ten are
musty to the nose, offensive to the eye. Can anyone
tell me where Cocky and his family wash? Do they
ever bath? Where does he comb his whiskers or
does he suspend them out of window when he goes
to bed ? There seems no intelligible reason why the
Coeky-infested countryside should be so horribly
dilapidated, but if there is any possible scheme of
“planning” redemption, the Time Is Ripe for making
a start. Rural housing in many parts is planned
after the ruins of Nineveh and Galway and the
exhortation to “go on the land” is really a recom-
mendation to go and live in a kennel.
* * * *
“Alarnon” : A tribe of myall blacks camped
near my Northern Territory humpy recently, and,
after their arrival small items went a-missing. One
day I sighted a nigger, named Kapok, streaking
off at my approach, and reckoned he was the thief.
So the next day, armed with a small alarm clock,
I sauntered up to the camp. “You bin stealum
somefeller tucker longa me?” I demanded ; but only
an indignant chorus of “No more!” came back. I
put the clock down on a tree trunk. “This one
dcbbil-debbil bin talk longa me,” I said. “S’pose
you come clo-o-o-se up, him sing out s’pose you bin
stealum longa me.” I marched the king up to the
clock first. No sign, and he stepped back triumph-
antly. A few lubras followed; still no sign, and the
tribe was jubilant. Then I grabbed Kapok, and led
him up to the clock. “This one bin stealum tucker
longa me?” I demanded, and at once a clamor
burst out. The following moment a terrified black
was streaking through the bush with the gait and
speed of an emu, and a troupe of frightened gins
and piccaninnies were trying to bury themselves in
the sand. Next day the tribe had vanished. But
there was a small pile of restored property outside
my humpy.
“Pick”: Weird and uncanny creatures of
the ocean are the pilot fishes which, always in
pairs, attend the full-grown blue-pointer, the West-
ralian tiger and other species of large man-eating
sharks. Their aim in life, apparently, is to scent
out prey for the scavenger that sneaks in their
wake, and to feast upon the offal he discards. They
are of a bluish color, snaky and scaleless, and
chuck the seven almost immediately when out of the
wet. But what beats me respecting them is that,
although more than two pilots are never seen in
company with a shark, if one is killed two will
again be on scout next time the brute noses around.
MRS. O'RAFFERTY: "I’ve had seven children, yer Reverence, and four are living. But,
bless yer, I’m that fond of ’em I wouldn't mind if they'd ail lived.”.
“Mrs. Lance Rawson” : In the early part
of 1881 I rescued an aboriginal girl of 14 or 15
from a shark in Wide Bay (Queensland), but not
before her right foot had been snapped off just above
the ankle. We weren’t more than 40yds. from the
shore, but by the time I had got her to safety she
had lost a considerable quantity of blood and was
unconscious. There wasn’t a chance of a doctor
within 24 hours at least, so we left her to her own
people. They stopped the bleeding with a mulch of
chewed gum-leaves. Then they put on a layer of man-
grove ashes, and lastly a covering of moist clay.
She slept but fitfully the first night, but the next
afternoon she was playing euchre. Within two
months she was stumping round on a badly-bandaged
bone, assisted by a good strong stick. For a year
that foot, or the want of it, was a source of revenue
to the camp at 3d. a peep. The following year some
philanthropist presented Matty with a brand new
artificial foot, which, when the novelty and notoriety
of it had worn off, became a rather effective weapon
of offence and a valued asset with which to gamble.
I once asked the girl why she didn’t wear it. “I’d
wear ’im all right, only the blurry thing is too
blurry proud. Him won't walk longa ’nother foot.
Me think it all the time that fella want to damnwell
show off.” .
* * *
“Nell”: I Soritlially agree with “Oimai”
(B. 1677/’l4) re the Australian blacks being indul-
gent parents. I lived close by one of their large
camping grounds on the Barwon for some years, and
I see a child ill-used. On the contrary,
they were mostly “spoiled,” their parents continuing
to pamper and wait on them, even when they (the
children) were full grown and had babies of their
own. As they treated their own, even so they treated
the other youngsters of the camp. It was a common
thing to see a gin with several of her own go off on
tours with a couple of someone else’s. No one could
tell by the treatment of the children that they were
not all one family. I have seen both the men and
the women of the camp, when victuals were scarce,
divide among the children and the very old ones
such scraps as they had, going without food them-
selves. The blacks are also very good to their dogs,
goats, etc. As for the treatment of the women, I
think it is just about a muchness as among the
whites. Some couples were always quarelling in this
camp I speak of, and I would wake o’ nights with
my hair on end while the welkin rang with the
piercing yells of Mary undergoing chastisement. In
the morning she was always more or less all right.
I think she enjoyed it. Likewise I have seen hus-
bands as well and truly henpecked as any poor
white man.
“Moana”: Up in Nine in the Cook Group
the natives have a habit oi burying their dead in
a plot adjoining a roadway, hence some of the public
thoroughfares are hedged by ornamental boneyards.
It is the custom to place on a native’s grave the
article that he most cherished during life; so if
you stroll along one of Niue’s streets you will see
A NATURAL SEQUENCE.
"How is it, Johnny, whenever I bring yon
out you always want everything you see?”
"S’pose it’s because I see everything I want.”
graves decorated with such things as a bright green
sunshade, a 4s. 6d. watch, a safety razor or a rusty
typewriter. No one ever touches any of these things.
In fact, if you have anything you value and don't
want to lose, the safest place to plant it is on a
natives grave. The average islander would rather
bite himself in a vital spot three times than touch
anything placed on his brother’s mound.
(Continued on page 26.)
THE DESERTED HUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Deep in the bush a lonely hut,
Of clay and wattle made,
Stands jet, with low, bent door long shut,
And bare, ribbed walls decayed,
A wooden chimney, earthen floor,
A poor man’s hidden nest—
t\ here thin, burnt saplings round the door
Greet but the sun for guest.
A rusty spade, a billy black,
Outside the chimney lie;
And gay weeds choke the little track
Where not a soul goes by ;
But through the smoke-hole you may see
A bed of ferns, a chair,
Naught else, nor guess what he might be
Who once was living there.
Maybe he fossicked in the creek,
Prospected many a hill,
Or crossed the further range to seek
The timber for the mill.
The creek has now but sunshine’s gold,
And, on the sawmill’s ground,
Where forest trees were bought and sold,.
There’s but a sawdust mound.
None know the story—folly, drink,
Remorse or deep disgrace;
But he was wise, I like to think,
Who chose this lonely place,
..Some old bush sage, who smiled at fate,
And came at last one day—
One quiet day, to meditate
This casual life away.
What better could the old man choose
Than this deserted spot,
Where dreams come soft as evening dews
And heavy thoughts are not,
To take his fill of earth’s desire,
And die without demur ;
Or smoke a pipe beside the fire

“Lagani-Namo”; Dr. Gerald Sharpe,
Anglican Bishop of Papua, reckons that Christianity
is spreading apace among the Papuans. He in-
stances that: —
Sixteen years ago the people of Boga-Boga used
to buy captives from other villages for three
pigs per head, and then eat them ; but now, each
month, there are 80 devout. communicants there. In
another village, where everything seemed hopeless
four years ago, there are, now 75 communicants.
Many of the people'have jo walk long journevs o
six or eight hours in order to attend ; Sunday ser-
vice. It was intended to ordain two Papuans as
deacons next month.
Well, I’m satisfied that ; the natives in 'Geralds
bishopric have got that worthy divine by his gaiter.
If the miners, traders, planters or Government patri i
parties were removed from ’the Territory to day the
Papuans would revert to their former cannibalistic
habits to-morrow, or the day after. 1 f they took
the trouble to thank Providence for anything, if
would be for furnishing , them with such well
nourished and luscious missionaries for their cook-
ing pots. As for ordaining Papuan natives and
entrusting them to expound Scripture and Church
doctrine to other natives, v it is utterly ridiculous.
I’ve wandered considerably about Papua, in such a
way as to he able to analyse these natives and their
notions, and I never came across any Papuan
capable of comprehending the so-called “mysteries of
religion,” let alone of understanding the logical
and often illogical deductions peculiar to our faith.
There isn’t a bona-fide Christian native in all Papua
—I don’t care whether you' search for shell in Angli-
can, Roman Catholic, Wesleyan or Seventh-Day
Adventist spheres of influence. The specimens who
turn up to the church services are simply Rice Chris-
tians. They don’t attend - ’ to fill their souls witli
holiness, hut to fill their innards with food, which
is directly or indirectly obtainable by any native
hypocrite.

“N. or M.”: Concerning the remarks of
“F.Y.7” (B. 16/7/’l4). Even here in Tassy, where
it never droughts to any Textent, a spell of dry
weather will bring the bandicoots, magpies and
minahs hustling to the troughs where stock is being
watered. The Tasmanian bandicoot is a friendly
little chap, and a great destroyer of pests, hut his
burrowings have given him an evil and undeserved
reputation for bandycooting potatoes, whereas, as a
matter of fact, he is an anti-vegetarian out for
grubs. lie will slip down from his bush selection on
the smallest provocation, and have a drink of milk
and a friendly set-to with the farm cats. Have seen
him and his family prospecting a neighbor’s verandah
and mafficking noisily round an empty 1 pot that he
had tumbled into in the kitchen. A good deal of our
Australian and Maoriland fauna is of a particularly
chummy disposition—f’rinstance, the hear, weka,
magpie, bandicoot. On the other hand, Hie Tas-
man devil is a devil, and no one I know of, except
Mrs. Roberts, of Beaumaris, Hobart, has been able
to tame him. She has one in a private zoo.
“Pick” : You don’t get me voting for no-
license. We were chrome-mining at Coolac
(N.S.W.). Our mate, Joe O’Donncl, was visited
by a thirst that only a three-days’ jag at Gavin’s
pub could assuage. We, meanwhile, tunnelled 20ft.
into apparently safe country. Joe resumed yakker
on the Saturday morning’s shift,' but at nine
o’clock he caved in. lie hadn’t eaten anything
but beer since Tuesday, and was weak as limejuice

“Moaua”: Some news that drifted through
recently about the sale of a mahogany log in London
reminds me that the record price so far for this type
of lumber was obtained in the Big Smoke in 1913,
when a single African mahogany tree realised £4OlO
12s. A little later in the same year three logs from
another tree were sold by the same firm, and brought
in £2477 6s. Yet there arc, or used to be, rail-
ways in Central America which had mahogany sleep-
ers and used marble for ballast.

AGED C ADGER: “Not me. Why, if a toff comes in he mightn't see it was empty.”
"Kapina” : Here’s testimony to the stories
of “Main-Bearing - ’ and other Abologists re niggers
tackling sharks and alligators. I stitched with needle
and packing - twine a leg - that had been torn by an
alligator at the mouth of the Vaillala River, in
Papua. The nigger was dragged from a canoe moored
alongside a lianuabada lakatoi, which had made its
annual trip along to the Gulf, trading earthenware
pets for sago. At the victim’s cry
the 50 or so crew immediately
jumped on the ’gator, which let go
the native and sank from sight. A
game on this principle used to be
played by the Papuan crew of the
old Merrie England. A big shark
being sighted nosing around the
ship, the nigs, would all stand
ready on the bulwarks. One would
jump into the water, whereupon the
shark would rush at him. Just as
it was about to grab its lunch 20
tons of hurtling nigger would land
on its roof. That shark never
smiled again. The late Tonares,
skipper of the Merrie England,
once joined the game, and took his
turn as the bait. The shark sped
towards him, and he was beginning
to wonder if he was unpopular with
his crew, when the woolly-headed
sports arrived with a unanimous thud and a yell
lik: the siren in the foundry of Sheol at knock-off
time.
“N. or M.” : I fancy that tick that “Zamia”
talks about (B. 9/7/’l4) was not the beef-pest, but the
gohanna’s own private and copyrighted tick. . Our
dasmaman go. (a blue-torgued lizard, not the main-
land beast) pastures a parasite of this kind which
docs not attack cattle. The tick goes for the com-
paratively soft spot under the leg joint, where it
joins the body, and the victim doesn’t worry. Once
saw two of the stolid brutes having a difference of
opinion, at least it looked as if it might be that.
No. 1 had got a good grip of the other fellow’s side
and had bitten well in and held oil. A drop or two
of blood oozed and congealed, but, for any move-
ment, both parties might have been dead. My
acquaintance with a tame gohanna goes to show that
iron administered per medium of an accidental pitch-
fork through the body does not disturb his lizardship
in the least. His claim to a place in the sun is
that he is a champion sriake fighter. An eye witness
whom I rely on has seen a gohanna, when bitten,
chew fronds of bracken and mouth the stuff into the
wound.
\ igilana : Re “Brumby’s” par. concern-
ing Crocodiles in the North (B. 16/7/’l4), and the
mention of a child being snatched by one of the
devils while filling a billy. In my travels ill Kim-
berley, the Territory and North Queensland, t have
heard of many such eases, but the greatest shock I
over got was on the Norman River, 20 miles from
Norman ton. 1 was camped not far from the river,
and was fishing off the bank. Presently 1 moved
from the spot for fresh bait, and the next ihStant
a tornado swept over the exact place where 1 had
been standing. It was the enormous tail of a croco-
dile. The water in the Norman is discolored, and
always in motion, and crocodiles will lie peacefully
nuclei it, making not a ripple while remaining prac-
tically stationary. The river is one of the most
infested in North Queensland. If it were not for the
enemies to the young, fish and birds, it would be
overrun with the foul-smelling creatures,

“I’MI.Ii.”: “Tiaki’s” par. (B. l(>/7/’14)
reminds me of twin brothers who lived near Orange
many years back. One of Suitor’s overseers hap-
pened to be on the run near the Macquarie River,
when lie heard a horseman who seemed to he in a
mirry. lie hid himself in the blanches of an over-
hanging apple tree, and awaited developments One
oi: these twins followed a mob of Sutter’s cattle
along the range, eventually. cutting out a couple of
head -ore a white, fat heifer easily sworn to. These
be drove- to Stony Creek, near Stuart Town, and
that night was arrested with the stolen cattle In
bis yard. The case seemed hopeless only for bail
which allowed a smart lawyer to place the other
brother in the dock. An alibi —a true one of
course was easily proven, and the case dismissed •
and it was some years before Suttor’s overseer saw
Hirongb the game. It was said of these brothers
that they both fought a man once, one doing a
couple of lively rounds and then excusing himself

“Gouger” : Do any of you know old Dan
Cosgrove, boundary riding on a Barwon sheep ranch
now? Some five years ago he took out the station
poison cart, but didn’t return. Next morning they
found him propped up beside a burning log. llis
leg had been broken near the ankle. Pressing
against his injured foot with his good leg, then
pulling the broken leg backwards hard, Dan had at
last got the bone to slip back into its place. A
pretty hard task for any man; and Dan had passed
his sixtieth year. Those nights were bitterly cold,
so the injured man had by inches dragged himself
backwards over a hundred yards to a dry log. The
first thing he asked for was tobacco. They got him
into a waggonette, the station carpenter being told
off to drive him with all speed to Walgett Hospital,
a distance of 18 miles. The boss gave the car-
penter a bottle of whisky, with instructions to pass
Dan a nip now and then. These instructions were
faithfully carried out, except that the carpenter
himself frequently had a nip, just to keep Dan
company. The first 10 miles went swiftly by, as
also did the whisky. The empty bottle was slung
away, and the next eight miles were done in
furious time. At each pub in the long, straggling
street of Walgett, the ambulance halted, until at
last a kindly publican, noticing Dan’s frantic
attempts to drive the waggonette into the bar,
gathered up the reins and steered the vehicle lo
the hospital, to the patient’s immense disgust. 011
Dan’s leg got better.
* * * *
“Unregen”: I’m in trouble, and it’s this
way. I have had the misfortune to lose one of my
legs, and am constantly beset by well-meaning people
who want to know all about it. They are a
nuisance, but I can generally manage to get rid of
them by telling them that I bit it off in my sleep.
The other day, however, in front of the Cathedral
here in Melbourne, at three o’clock in the afternoon,
when Mrs. Suburbs was bustling along to spend
hubby’s wages at the sales, I met a different kind,
who informed me that she was very, very, ve-r-y sorry
for me. I told her there were times when I was
sorry for myself. She then cast her eves to where
Heaven is supposed to be, and assured me that she
believed in prayer. I weakly replied that 1 didn’t
see why I should go for an injunction. Thus encour-
aged, she asked if she might pray for me. Thinking
she would go home and pray, I said it was very
good of her. To my horror, she immediately flopped
down on the cold stones. 1 made one wild grab,
caught her by . the arm and held her up, and soon
we were wrestling - according to any old rules. All
the time she Was shrilly protesting that she; must
pray for me, and ivould pl’ay for me, now and at
once, Fi Badly 1 escaped, only to meet her Oh the
F.iinders-street station. There the same scene was
repeated with a few variations. By this time I
was- able to emphatically refuse to be prayed for in
public at any time. Yet I am afraid to turn a
corner for fear of meeting an unhatched prayer, and
next time she may beat me and get her prayer in
because i can’t dodge very quickly. So I want to
ask tiie Religious Editor what 1 am to do. Shall 1
leave the prayer on the cold stones or shall t wait
and pass round a hat among- the crowd that will
inevitably gather?
PROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT,
There is an agitation in Melbourne for the em-
ployment of women police.
LADY COP: “Now, you come with me, my
man."
RESPECTABLE MELBOURNE CITIZEN (indig-
nantly): “Shertainly NOT. Mosh im-
proper (flic) suggeshion make to any
reshpecahle married man.”
“Pickliandle”: Any Abo-liars had any
experience with black magpies when poisoning
foxes? Laid a couple of nc-at trails the other even-
ing, with the best of intentions towards Reynard,
and, to guard against marauders in the shape of
crows, I have a habit of burying the baits and
covering them well. The next day I found a huge
slaughter among those scavengers of the bush, the
black magpies. They have a scent like a fox or a
dog, because they had followed the trail along,
until the whole length of it was strewn with their
carcases.

Electric Soup.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN Hongkong, Shanghai and Macao, in
Kobe and in Tokio and in most other
places in Asia where money is at call
to help luxury, beche-de-mer, by its many
names, makes a soup that is potent enough
to be called electric. Much of it, and the
best of it, comes from Australian waters
by its many names of beche-de-mer, trepang,
teatfish, lolly fish, sea-snail, sea-cucumber.
The bolothuria is picked up from the reefs
at low water or won by skin divers in the
shallows of two or three fathoms.
From the galleys of the luggers blue smoke
rises at dawn and is quickly lost in blue
air. Turquoise islands break through the
cobalt of the sea. The reefs, with organic
life teeming among their corals, sparkle in
the sunlight. The reef gatherers walk in
the shallow water as delicately as Agag, for
about the sand are the black sea urchins,
their needle-like spines ready for the hand
or foot of intruding man. There are
trochus shells upon the reefs and Tridacua
gigas, the giant clam ready to punish an
involuntary invasion with death; and
bouquets of madrepora corals, cream and
mauve and brilliant green staghorn corals,
and the opalescent tide swelling to the
flood. And in the pool depths and on the
sea floor are the trepang of all colors —
bright lilac barred with brown and spotted
in ovate gold; trepang with mammiliform
excrescences, whence the name “teatfish”;
trepang whose dried skin divides into loz-
enge-shaped areas, whence the name
“lolly fish” ; trepang 4ft. long and bin. broad
with rosette-shaped growths that make it
appear like a sheepskin when lifted from
the water. When smoked these growths
become thorns.
In these sandy brakes and sheltered pools
the trepang. grasping the sand and corals
with their tentacles, feed it into their cir-
cular mouths. The gatherer comes and
sends them to surface to be boiled for 20
minutes, gutted, sun-dried and smoked
over red mangrove fires for 24 hours until
they contract and thicken to half their
natural extended length. With the flushed
appearance of a charred sausage they are
bagged for export. Water is their destruc-
tion, and if wetted their tendency to absorb
moisture dissolves the trepang into a glue of
horrible look and odor.
Luggers of five or six tons act as col-
lectors and tenders to schooners of 50 tons,
with smoke houses and small boats.
Binghis, Papuans, South Sea Islanders and
Filipinos are their* crews, and gins clean
and prepare the trepang for the smoke
houses. *
The fish —or animal—-is collected during
the low tides in the new and full phases
of the moon, so eight or 10 days of lunar
month are lost. The work suits the
Binghis (the North Australian natives)
because it is fishing and hunting, and seems
not to be work. They return year after
year to it as a pleasure, though they have
been known to maroon a boss on a coral
islet or abandon him on a reef to die at
the lifting of these tremendous northern
tides.
The embryo of bCche-de-mer, like the spat
of the pearlshell, is tide-borne until it
settles in deep water, there to experience its
metamorphoses. When mature the trepang
cdmes to the shallows to feed, and battle with
its enemies, and withstand strong currents
and deep tides. Trepang of the marketable
varieties varies, in price from £6O to £lBO
per ton, and specially picked lots may sell
at £240. The Chinese, who represent
almost all the buyers, grade the sorts in this
way:—
Black teatfish (See Ok Sum) .. £l6O per ton.
White teatfish (Ma See Up) . . 60 ~
Deep-water red fish (Hung Hur) . . 105 ~
Surf red fish (Ba doy Hur) . . 85 ~
Deep-water crape (Chao Sah) .. 110 ~
Ordinary (Woo Sum) .. .. 85 ~
Large lolly fish (Chong Sum) . . 55 „
These are the principal varieties, but
there are many others more or less market-
able.
The Barrier Reef and its contained waters
produce a great deal of trepang, the annual
value of the fishing being over £25,000. But
for more than a century the most success-
ful organised trepangers came on the Malay
fleet from Macassar southward to the Ara-
fura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria on
the nor’-west monsoon, and went back on
the south-east monsoon after the fishing.
They were thus easily found between mon-
soons, but in the old days supervision was
merely a name until the South Australian
Customs sent officers out to hold up the
Malays and make them declare.
For many years their declared aver-
age annual take was worth £BOOO,
and in one year £lO,OOO. Four years
ago the Commonwealth Government, pur-
suing its protective policy of the
aborigines, warned the Malays off the Ara-
fura Sea and the Gulf, and the annual voy-
ages that had been made for over a century
—the record beginning from Flinders’s meet-
ing of the proas in 1803 —were ended.
Now for 2000 miles of North Australian
coasts there are nine tre-
pangers—six white men and three Maoris,
whose labor wants are all supplied by
Binghis. On all the North Coast, from
Cape Don to Wesseil Islands, there are good
trepang grounds. Bowen Straits, Malay
Bay, Goulburn Islands, Guion Point, Brown
Straits and Elcho Islanff%all practically
unfished. V
The coast has many evidences of ancient
Malay occupation—great middens at century-
old, camps, and groves of tamarinds planted
by the men of Macassar. For safety the
Malays made their».calupS" on islands, feeding
the natives as a raalfer of policy, but seldom,
if ever, working thctm They brought their
own Malay divers, and many a tragedy have
those wooded islands, in the shallows seen - -
the killing of/tfieir slaves by overwork and
beatings and the marooning of those who
were too strong to die.. Many of the crew
were paid on shares, and the marooning of
men for alleged acts of insubordination dis-
posed of all trouble in, the matter of divi-
dends or short rations, if the provisions of a
long voyage became too small for the re-
turn. There are many graves on Elcho
and the English Company’s Islands.
Every beach has its turtle coral, and the
prevailing odor of the black islanders speaks
loudly of a diet of turtle and alligator. The
blacks say that no Malay woman ever came
to Australia, but aborigines of both sexes were
taken away as slaves. There is a half-caste
Malay girl at the Wessels who is said to be
very beautiful. J. T. Beckett, Inspector
of Aborigines, tells of a wild half-caste on
the western shores of the Gulf. He is 19
years old, 6ft. 6in. in height, weighs 15st.,
and can run down a kangaroo. He should
be a good man to train for the ring, as his
punch is said to be more like the kick of a
horse than the arm blow of a man. The
settlement along our North Coast is con-
fined to blacks and the nine trepangers.
From the Alligator River, east and south
to the Roper, with all the intervening
islands of beach and jungle and belts of
Cyprus pine, there are only wild natives.
The last charting of these waters is that
by the hand of the great Matthew Flinders,
but sea movements since his day have made
the charts in places undependable. The old
documents mark nine fathoms at the
entrance, to Brown Strait, and a few months
an'o the Waihoi touched sand when drawing
6ft. To Arnheim Bay—a great, deep estuary
—an unmarked river debouches. It is a
river with an entrance three miles wide.
Turtle come ashore in quantity on every
beach, and land marked on the charts as
“low, wooded shores” shows cliffs as high
as the North Head of Port Jackson.
Along these great areas of shallows are
colonies of trepang, now abandoned to the
black men who do not want it, and to the
six white men and the three Maoris, who
are unequal to winning one per cent, of the
available quantity.
Trepang once brought to the white man’s
table will largely displace turtle as soup
stock. The Chinese have sought after it
so eagerly that the leaky proa, with the
bamboo masts and the mat sails, made voy-
ages which, centuries ago, without compass
or any instrument for finding position, were
equal to many of the expeditions of the
most advertised navigators. As may be
seen from the table of prices earlier in this
article, values are largely determined by
color. Gossip in the Gulf and at Port Dar-
win alleges that one trepanger, being in
possession of inferior fish, made them ap-
proximate to the desired red tint by tanning
them with mangrove bark. Chinese buyers
bought the trepang at top prices, but when
the fish became electric soup at Shanghai
many high-class Chinese became so ill and
revengeful as to make that prudent and re-
sourceful trepanger cut China out of his
honeymoon trip. Before the Australian in
the south prints beche-de-mer soup as a
regular item on his menu, the Pure Foods
Act will probably amend itself to exclude
mangrove bark as a condiment.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
“Moana” : The howl of the boiling scrap
of Ulster is not new. It threw rocks and
rushed madly about, breathing threats of
blood and slaughter, in 1886, just as it is
doing to-day. Ulster, in fact, although
small and insignificant, has always had a
reputation for noise-making. Just 28 years
ago, when Gladstone brought down his
famous Home Rule for Ireland Bill, Ulster
shouted for special treatment. In fact, it
asked for about 16 different things, pre-
sumably in the hope that it might get one.
It demanded entire exclusion, it wanted
separate autonomy, or at least a reserva-
tion of certain matters, such as education,
which were to be controlled by a provincial
council. Gladstone rejected all the de-
mands. The proposals in his Bill, which
he introduced on April 8, 1886, were not
really as revolutionary as some people sup-
posed they w T ere. All taxing powers would
be in the hands of the Irish Parliament, but
it was to be subject to all the prerogatives
of the Crown, was to have nothing what-
ever to do with the army or navy, or with
foreign or colonial relations, nor could it
modilf.v the Act upon which its own
authority would be based. All contracts,
charters, questions of education, religious
endowments and religious establishments
would be beyond its authority, as were
trade and navigation, coinage, currency,
weights and measures, copyright, census,
quarantine laws and several other matters.
The proportion of Imperial charges that
Ireland was to bear was placed at one-
fifteenth. A passionate and bitter debate
followed and lasted until June 3. Then
the largest division ever recorded in the
British House of Commons was taken, there
being 657 members present. The Bill was
defeated by a majority of 30, and Glad-
stone’s Ministry was down and out.
♦
From Melbourne: —
Each election provides its unconscious joke in
human form. Victoria’s contribution at the present
crisis is Dr. Kent Hughes, who is challenging that
other joyous medico, Maloney, for the Melbourne seat.
Hughes was the High Joss of the Essendon Football
Club, till his archaic ideas shocked the more intel-
lectual of the ’bailers into passing him out. His
orations, or discourses, or addresses, or lectures, or
whatever they are, seldom exceed half an hour, and
they touch, either very lightly or not at all, on
such problems as Protection, Defence, the initiative,
the conversion and redemption of the State debts
and the development of the Territory. But into one
thing the doctor probes deeply—the maternity bonus.
He thinks the Commonwealth should provide services
instead of cash. That appears to be his entire
policy. He usually expounds it passionately, until
some ribald person interjects, when Hughes bleats:
“Constable, kindly remove that elector; he annoys
me.’’ No one has been given six months for irritat-
ing Hughes so far, but though the multitude scoffs—
in fact, shrieks —he plainly expects that Justice will
yet be done.
[F. C. Jones, Elgar-road, Burwood, Vic.]
James Bennett, who is contesting Gipps-
land (Vic.), possesses a naif honesty that
will yet be his political ruin. It was in
evidence the other nie-ht, when he blandly
informed the Mirboo citizens that he believed
in Protection and the initiative and refer-
endum, but would vote against all of them
in order to save his' party from defeat. One
of the differences between this self-con-
victed dummy and his opponent, Wise, is
that the latter advocates a similar policy on
those questions and is tied to no party.

The Aged and Infirm
Are sometimes more susceptible to Coughs and Colds on the Chest than the Young and
Vigorous. When an Aged Person gets a Cold, it is of the utmost importance that not
only is the Best Remedy taken immediately, but that the Remedy is one that does
not cause any Heart Depression nor in any way weaken an already frail constitution.
In such a case, Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure is just the proper Medicine to use, as
it is the Quickest, Safest and Best— -a Remedy that makes good every time.

SANATDGEN
Let Sanatogen Make You Healthier.
You will certainly be healthier,
stronger, and more vigorous, if
you take a few weeks’ course of
Sanatogen.
“Since taking Sanatogen, I am
really better—a brighter, stronger
tone altogether,’’writes Lady Muir.
Even after the first few doses —
which, by the way, we will send
you free of charge—you will
notice a marked improvement in
your condition.
Your nervous system, in par-
ticular, will be wonderfully in-
vigorated. Witness this statement
by Madame Sarah Grand, the fa-
mous authoress of “The Heavenly
Twins ” and other well - known
novels:
“ 1 pin my faith to Sanatogen,
because it certainly restored me
to health in the worst nervous
break-down I ever had. It is a
building-up process, but not.
‘jerry-building’ —the work is done
to last.”
In Digestive Troubles,
etc.
Yes, the good which Sanatogen
does is lasting , not only in a
nervous break - down but in
various other conditions. For
example, Mrs. Kensington, wife of
Mr. Justice Kensington, Lahore,
India, writes : “ Sanatogen is the
best help for digestive troubles
that I have come across. Mr.
Kensington and I have also found
it a wonderful reviver and tonic.”
In Anaemia.
The effects of Sanatogen in
poverty of the blood are described
as follows by Dr. Ferchmin,
physician to the Czar of Russia:
“My daughter, who was very
anaemic, has been greatly benefited
by the use of Sanatogen. Her
appetite improved, her weight in-
creased, and the colour of her
skin became healthier.”
Equally remarkable are the ef-
fects of Sanatogen in the case of
weakly children of all ages.
Public Health , one of the promi-
nent medical papers, contains an
article by a well-known doctor
who says : “ I determined to try
Sanatogen on a child suffering
from really pitiable debility. The
change in her condition at the
end of a fortnight was truly won-
derful. Appetite was improved,
diarrhoea had stopped, the cheeks
were rosy, and her weight had
increased by 1-lb. 10-oz.”
Sanatogen is of the greatest
value before and after confinement,
because nothing is so effectual for
building up and strengthening
the system. It is also strongly
recommended for nursing mothers
to ensure that the milk shall be
abundant and healthy.
Other uses of Sanatogen—for
example, in Neuralgia, Nervous
Headache, and Insomnia, etc. —
are too numerous to mention here.

tioning this paper, for a

AUDITORS’ REPORT.
We have examined the above balance-sheet, made up to 30th June, 1914, and report that we find the
several items therein stated to conform to the Balances in the General Ledger and the Balance-sheets of
the respective Branches of the Bank collectively.
We have counted the cash and examined the Bills held by the Bank at the Head Office in Sydney on
the 30th June, 1914, and hereby certify that we have found them correct. We further certify that all
Vouchers, Accounts and Documents necessary for verifying the Balance-sheet have been submitted to us.
The Cash, Bills and other Securities held at the Branch Banks in New South Wales and Queensland
on the date of Balancing have been certified to as being correct by the usual documents, and the figures of
the Balance-sheet of the London Branch have been received by cable.
In our opinion the above is a full and fair Balance-sheet, containing the particulars required by the
Articles of Association of the Australian Bank of Commerce, Limited, and properly drawn up so ae to
exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the Company’s affairs as shown by the books of the
Company.
WILLIAM 11. PERRY, F.C.P.A.,
WILLIAM CRAIG, P.C.P.A.,
Auditors.
In moving the adoption of the Report and Balance-sheet for the Half-year ended June 30, the
Chairman said:—
In considering the figures of the Balance-sheet, the most satisfactory comparison to make is with the
figures of a year, rather than with those of six months, ago; as the former is the more likely to reflect
the real progress, in a country where the preparation for, and the results of, its seasons cause a certain
ebb and flow in its finances as the year goes round. On either method of comparison being applied, how-
ever, satisfactory development is shown by the Balance-sheet.
During the year there has been an increase of over £500,000 in the total figures, which have risen
from £5,733,000 to £6,237,000. On the liabilities side deposits have increased by £452,000, and now
stand at £2,980,000 —a feature which gives us considerable satisfaction.
The Reserve Fund is larger by £20,000, transferred out of profits; whilst other net increases are
incidental to the growing business of the Bank.
Taking the Assets side of the Balance-sheet, the items of coin and- their equivalent, in readily realis-
able items, such as short loans in London, Government Securities, Australian Notes, Balances due by other
Banks, and Bills receivable, amount to the substantial figure of £1,770,000, and show an increase of
£288,000 on the corresponding figures of a year ago, the strength of the Bank in this direction being
thus fully maintained. The Bank’s holding of coin, together with these readily realisable items, is equal
to over 53 per cent, of our total liabilities to the public, or, in other words, for every pound of the public’s
money we hold over 10/6 in cash or its equivalent, and the position as a whole is one of great financial
soundness.
During the year the Bank’s bills discounted, loans and other advances have increased by £226,000,
from £3,864.000 to £4,090,000, and it is satisfactory for shareholders to know that the real volume of
new business is considerably larger than the figure of £226,000 mentioned, owing to substantial realisa-
tions of old Assets, the proceeds of which have been used in new advances.
Referring again to the item of “Government Securities” it may be noticed that these words now
replace the words “British Consols,” which appeared in the last and previous Balance-sheets. After due
consideration, we decided to take the opportunity provided by a rise in the value of Consols, and realised
our holding at a price slightly in excess of the figure at which it stood in the Bank’s books. The money
has been reinvested in other high-clas3 Stocks, easy of realisation, all of which are repayable on a definite
date —the larger proportion being so repayable within quite a few years. Greater stability in market
values may therefore be expected, than is the case with Stocks for which no definite date of repayment hag
been undertaken.
We are alive to the necessity of extending the Bank’s business. The opening of several new Branches
has been appreciated in districts where needed Banking facilities have been provided, and our general
business tends to improve, in consequence.
Turning to the Profit and Loss Account you will note the amount provided during the six months for
Graduated Land Tax and Income Tax —a fairly large item. During the past half-year we have not received
the same rates of interest on our London Balances as we had obtained during the previous 3 or 4 years
—owing to a fall in the value of money there.* These items, together with the fact that extra
provision for our staff, necessary under existing circumstances, has been made, accounts for the slight
reduction in the profits for the half-year.
We are pleased to say the reports from our various Branches as to the prospects for the coming
season are of a favorable nature.
The Motion was seconded by Mr. Mark Sheldon, and carried unanimously.
The retiring Directors, Dr. G. .T. Slv and Mr. Mark Sheldon, were re-elected to the Board.
Mr. William Craig, F.C.P.A., and Mr. G. Mason Allard, F.C.P.A., were elected Auditors for the ensu-
ing year.
A vote of thanks was accorded to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers of the Bank.
At a subsequent meeting of the Directors, Sir W. P. Manning was again elected Chairman of the Bank.


WHY HAIR FALLS OUT.
THE CAUSE—AND ITS PREVENTION.
Dr. N. DUCLAUD.
Your hair falls out either because the roots
shrivel up and die, or because the scalp
relaxes and loosens its hold upon the hair
roots. This is almost invariably due to
dandruff germs which rob the hair of its
nutrition, actually starving it to death. To
atop falling hair and prevent total or partial
baldness the dandruff germ must be de-
stroyed. For this purpose, physicians and
hair specialists now invariably prescribe a
lotion composed of \ dram menthol crystals,
three ounces of bay rum, and one ounce of
lavona de compos6e. Rub well into the scalp
with the fingertips, and every dandruff germ
will be destroyed within two or three days.
The hair will stop falling out and begin to
grow at an amazing rate, and brittle and
scanty hair will Quickly become soft, glossy
and luxuriant. The results following the
use of this formula are so truly remarkable
that I strongly advise every reader whose
hair falls out to give it a trial at once.*

“Melb”: Her Majesty’s, leased by the
Williamson Co., is reported to be in the j
market. Williamson got it for a song, com-
paratively speaking, and when the lease
expires it will be worth £lOO a week, like the
Royal, or £lO5, like the Tivoli. The house
was designed by Barnet, under Joubert’s
instruction, on the model of the old Ring
Theatre, Vienna, which was burnt, with the
loss of 300 lives. Her Majesty’s is a great
improvement upon the Ring in the matter
of exits, through being handier to the
streets and not cumbered with bars.
Our theatre fires have been many, but none
disastrous, in human life, because they have
not come during performances. Still there;
have been ticklish times—many. Elsewhere
the rule is that theatre doors must open out-
wards. In Australia they are in many in-
stances made to open inwards. It should
not be. Think how readily such doors may
be forced-to by a frantic rush. Strict
regulations are called for also in regard to
variety or picture theatres where two shows
are given in a night. Sometimes you can
hardly get out of the first show’ through
the cram for the second. This caused one
of the most.. fearful . American, disasters:
people were actually struggling, to get into
the roast! -
“Stargazer”: In the booming of the Car-
pentier-Smith battle the .beauty of the contes-
tants was strongly impressed upon the public
mind. The Frenchman’s superlative attrac-
tions are his best asset, and “Gunboat’s"
good looks are of great value to him as a
public entertainer. The tendency to utilise
a pug’s lack of absolute ugliness as an adver-
tising attribute is creening in here. too. The
finish is in sight—pugs who are not as
pretty as the nice boys who “walk on” in
Cockney comic-opera, or who lack the charm
of popular tenors, won’t get a look-in. The
demand for a pleasing appearance in pugs
began in Paris. It is an instance of woman’s
refining influence. Ladies having become
fight-fans, their tastes must be considered,
and the day is at hand when a broken nose
or a cauliflower ear will be sufficient to dis-'
qualify a slugger for life. Naturally the belt
zone will be shifted to the forehead, and the
wording of the rules will remain as before.
“C. Ockney” : Sydney Grundy certainly did
collaborate with Edward Solomon (“The
Vicar of Bray” was their joint work), but
I fancy “Harrison O.’s” yarn concerning the
twain improvising an opera for the Alham-
bra (B. 23/7/’l4) is not quite correctly
spun. The librettist, it is more likely, was
Henry Pottinger Stephens. Solomon was
in a chronic state of impecuniosity, and so
was “Pot.” The latter was librettist-in-
chief to the clever Teddy in those days, and
they turned out many operas together, in-
cluding “Billee Taylor,” “Claude Duval”
and “The Red Hussar.” Grundy surely was
never hard-up enough to run round, writing
opera “books” against time; besides, his
“lyrics” always gave him some trouble.
“Pot” Stephens, on the other hand, was a
facile versifier, and like Solomon, had a long
experience of ’ the music-halls where songs
are ordered in the morning and sung the
same night. Teddy played the piano for
years at the Middlesex Music Hall (the old
“Mogul”), and “Pot’s” first big success as
a comic-song writer was “The Two
Obadiahs.”.
"Melb’: Gilbert and Sullivan come back
to us like something almost new. Taking
their work in the order of time, I have only
a dim idea of “Thespis” being performed
in Australia. "Trial By Jury” has often
been heard, the last time, I think, with
Dolly Castles. "The Sorcerer” was intro-
duced with Lingard, who was also Sir
Joseph Porter in “Pinafore.” Other Sir
Josephs have included Williamson, Riccardi,
Elton and Lauri. Memorable the presenta-
tion at the lucky opening of Her Majesty’s
on Mafficking Night. “Pirates of Penzance”
is most familiar. Williamson took the First
Bobby, Verdi (Bill Green) was the Pirate
King, and Vernon the General Stanley; Ver-
non’s big chance was as Bunthorne in
“Patience,” with Verdi as Grosvenor, Beau-
mont as the Duke, Riccardi as Calverley,
Jack Forde as Murgatroyd, Alice Rees as
Patience, and Andree Navaro as . ,udy Jane.
In “lolanthe” the Chancellors have included
the matchless Brough, Thornton and Vernon,
all quite admirable. Walenn, ' of the
present company, is rather too subdued, but
obliterates former local records as Jack
Point in “The Yeoman of the Guard.” I
think Mclveown the best tenor we have heard
in Gilbert and Sullivan. Vernon shone as
Ivoko in "The Mikado”: he studied for it in
Japan. He. Elton, Ryley, Florence Young
and Ida Osborne! are remembered in the
first cast of the galloping “Gondoliers.”
FIVE FIGURES.
POMP: “ Yes, sir, I can write my cheque for five figures and have it honored .”
CIRCUMSTASCE (wearily): "I know. I saw the cheque. It was for £I 11s. 11d."
Nellie Stewart was beautiful in “Princess
Ida,” quite her best singing part. “Ruddi-
gore” hasn’t, I think, been witnessed in these
diggings. We didn’t care overmuch for
“Utopia.”
“Billy T.” : Australia is all right. I know
it for a fact. We need not worry about a
large and expensive system of Defence; a
small army for exhibition purposes is all we
need. He was an eleventh-rate American
variety performer, and he Lad been given a
dinner by a small tribe of suburban admirers,
and was expressing his gratitude in the cus-
tomary manner. “I’m real proud,” he said.
“I guess you’ve treated me pretty well, ’n’ I
ain’t goin’ t’ fergit it, sure. When I get back
there to my country this is goin’ t’ be talked
about. America’s goin’ t’ know how Aus-
tralia’s treated me, and, by the bully gee.
when America knows that, she’s goin’ t’
stand by Australia in any trouble she may
have with anvbody henceforth and for ever.”
WHO'S LOST A GLASS SLIPPER?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Who's lost a glass slipper? The night is so fair!
What lady among you can make up the pair ?
Tliere'll be rings on the grass when the morning
lambs bleat,
But someone goes by in her bare stockinged feet.
Who's lost a glass slipper? The prince where -he
sits
Is willing to marry the girl whom it fits..
Nay, madam, your foot is a trifle too wide,
Though you might get one finger quite nicely inside;
And you, my dear lady, can scarcely contrive
To wear it instead of your own number five.
Who’s lost a glass slipper? Don’t make the prince
wait!
lie's in no end of a hurry to find out his fate.
Is it yours, pretty maiden? It seems a tight squeeze.
Just try with the shoehorn I brought, if you please.
I’m afraid it's no use, though an inch more or so
Would give enough room to get in your big toe.
Who’s lost a glass slipper? Now where is the miss
Whom the prince grows quite angry because he can’t
kiss ?
Cinderella’s gone lome, and she knows very well
Though she’s walking lop-sided her sisters won’t
tell.
She crosses the pebbles with never a wince—
Let her pink fairy godmother wed the old prince!
Who’s lost a glass slipper? One girl has lost two
For the second she flung at a cat that she knew.
Who’s lost a glass slipper? The night is so "fair!
What lady goes dancing with nothing to wear
On her little pink feet in the Tango and Trot?
Now will the prince find Cinderella or not?
Her temper is bad, but her waist’s good to squeeze—
Who’s lost a glass slipper? Speak up if you please!

The Inky Way.
“Orient” : A somewhat remarkable visitor
to Melbourne just now is Dr. Macklin, who
has spent many years as a translator of Eng-
lish books at Nankin, China. Among those
handled have been George’s “Progress and
Poverty,” Schiller’s “History of the Thirty
Years War,” Green’s “History of England”
and Motley’s “Dutch Republic.” The Chinese,
like the Japanese, dig their teeth into all the
toughest books and relish such as Buckle's
“History of Civilisation,” Gibbon’s “Decline
and Fall,” Smith’s “Wealth of Nations,” and
everything bearing on European advance-
ment. They are also fond of the biographies
of soldiers, engineers and all kinds of practi-
cal men. Here is the elephant that will sit
on this little mouse of Australia if we don’t
look out. Is the Australian population
especially desirous of instructive books? No,
Rather for the weakening intellectual pap of
rubbishy novels!
“Homo”: The Victorian Licenses Reduc-
tion Board decrees that the Adam and Eve-
llotel shall be banished from its paradise in
Little Gollins-street, Melb. The ancient pub
has borne the name of our first father and
his second wife since its erection in 185-1.
There is still the old stall where Adam Lind-
say Gordon (attracted by the name, it is
said) stabled his favorite nag. As it stood
then stands now the old bar that he and
Marcus Clarke often breasted together, and
the parlor where foregathered Gordon,
Clarke, Henry Kendall, Bunster and Victor
Daley. Hereabouts Marcus, on first meet-
ing him, advised the budding Daley, inter
alia, to beware of swapping a silk purse for
a sow’s ear. “I didn’t know what he meant
then,” said Victor in after years, “but I
know now.” In the old bar a second-rate
bruiser lurched up to Gordon, who had been
beaten in a race at Werribee the previous
day, and said : “You can’t ride, Gordon ; you
look like a goat on a horse.” With the
remark that his tormentor would look better
as a corpse, Gordon’s “auctioneer” (the
right-handed knock which he acquired from
Tom Sayers) summarily ended the discus-
sion. A.L.G., by the way. had a penchant
for debating matters in this style. Once at
Fleinington. when they Jeered him for losing,
he jumped off his horse and scattered the
jeerers to the 14 winds. The night before
lie shot himself in the scrub behind the old
Marine Hotel, at Brighton, he and Kendall
and other kindred spirits had the deoch and
doris at the Adam and Eve. Not far away
—where now stands the Auditorium—was
the old Yorick Club, another rendezvous of
the talented clique which Marcus Clarke
wanted to name the “Skulls’ Club.”
Died recently in Jo’burg, S’Afriea, W
Secular, who, with Alex. Riddell, founded
the Times, the first paper printed at Broken
Hill. Riddell had been a Presbyterian par-
son ; Scoular was a Scotch mechanic. There
wasn’t much mechanism to see to on the
Times. A few pounds of type had been
raked up, and an old printing press carted
across from a Darling River township. J. S.
Reid, who had been on North Queensland
gold-rushes, was vegetating at Wilcannia
when the silver field was found. He made
across to Silverton and established the Silver
Age, got into the Broken Hill Prop., and
soon was able to give up backblocks journal-
ism, and become a mining, magnate. Riddell
and Scoular didn’t have the same luck; and
when they sold the Times to Melbourne
people they still had to scratch for a living.
Times and Silver Age have both long since
disappeared—swallowed by the Barrier
Miner. Scoular went on to S’Africa, where
he produced a patent percussion-ore concen-
trating table, which was afterwards manu-
factured in great numbers in the I'.S.A. He
had worked at the idea in Australia along
with Jos. Miller, afterwards manager of the
Long Tunnel mine. Among other inventions
of Scoular’s was a tote machine, produced at
the investigation of the “Tattersall’s” of
S’Africa —a chum of Scoular’s in Broken
Hill’s earliest days, when he sold meat-pies.
“Moana” : Any Australian pressman who
is pining because of the dull monotony of
his job is hereby urged to try Peking. The
regulations recently issued by the new
regime under which journalists are allowed
to labor make the Inky Way in China about
the most prickly path on earth. Before a
newspaper can start, the permission of the
President has to be obtained. This is a long
and tedious process, and the necessary
bribery is expensive. The names, .ages, birth-
places, past records and present addresses of
everyone to be employed on the paper, from
editor to printer’s devil, have to be sub-
mitted. The idea is to have the press all
on the side of the revolutionary party. The
police mostly decide whether a projected
newspaper and its editor and staff are of the
right color. If you have cash and are pre-
pared to part with it, you are “all li’ ”; if
you haven’t got cash, you needn’t come
around. Having fixed up the police you
have to deposit from lOOdol. to 300d01..
according to the amount of cash you have.
If your paper is to be published outside of
Peking, you have to deposit double the
amount. (The force doesn’t like papers
published a long way off —there is too much
walking to and fro when a loan is wanted.)
The police have the power to fine you for
everything, from setting a line upside down
to being sarcastic in the sporting column,
and are empowered to deduct the fines from
your deposit. While the deposit stands the
strain, fines are frequent. Life, in fact, is
one long fine. When your deposit is ex-
hausted you have to put up another or your
publication “must cease.” When a paper
gets going it mustn’t misrepresent the pre-
sent Government (Constable Ah Pat being
the sole judge as to whether misrepresenta-
tion has taken place), or disturb the peace,
or divulge military secrets, or report the pri-
vate proceedings in Parliament, or stick up
for the accused in a criminal case. If it
does any of these things, or about 5830 other
things, its deposit vanishes, and if it can’t
rake up another deposit it vanishes, too.
MY PEGASUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, when 1 hear a poet boil
About his muse that’s dead,
Through burning of the midnight oil
Above his towsled head,
I just sit down, anil write an ode,
In case mine dietli too,
And o’er the rugged poet’s road
Urge on my weary screw.
He's rather blind, is my old nag,
And gone about the chest —■
His hoots upon the roadway lag,
And he gets little rest.
He's never wen a handicap,
Meeause lie is too slow,
Yet sometimes, in a quiet nap,
I think I see him go.
I think I see him, topped with weight,
Pass one by one the set,
Ar.d see him coming down the straight
As never hone ran yet!
I watch his sides with sweat perspire,
And cheer him to the goal;
He helps to 1 eep poetic tire
In my poetic soul.

These interesting illustrations convey a good idea of the,
rough country passed through during E. F. Reichenbach’s
recent great Cycle Ride from Adelaide'to Port Darwin
—1969 miles—in 28 days 7 mins. It can be readily under-
stood that the success of such an undertaking all depends
on the staunchness of the Tyres. They must be Strong
and Reliable. The Tyres selected by Reichenbach were
DUNLOP TYRES
‘ Thornproof ” —and were taken out of stock, there being nothing
special about them-just the same consistent high quality
as supplied to the public. What a gruelling test the Tyres
were put to, is graphically told - pictonally. We might add
that Reichenbach did not have to repair a puncture until
nearing Daly Waters (1600 miles).

REMEDY.
Mrs. M. Johnson. 135 Elizabeth Street,

express my grateful appreciation of the
value of your Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm
Pellets. My little girl, aged three years,
was very had, continually picking her nose,
and jumping about in her sleep at nights!
till she was afraid of being left alone night
or day. My husband, after bringing home
different so-called remedies and ‘certain
cures,’ all of no earthly good, decided to
give Comstock's ‘Dead Shot.’■ Worm Pellets
a fair trial. 1 smiled when I saw what he
had, as I was sick and tired of trying to
cure tln> poor child. After taking the first
dose the result was marvellous; she must
have been simply alive with worms. I con-
tinued the treatment, giving her a pellet in
the morning, and a teaspoonful of castor oil
at night, and 1 am pleased to say that she
is thoroughly cured and has had no return
of the symptoms.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
On Friday night Inst week, when the rumor
that six German Warships were off the eoast
of Queensland ran like wildfire round the
streets of Sydney, men took off their hats
to Andrew Fisher and the Federal Labor
party for that we had such a ship as the
Australia to make some show of defence.
Had the Federal Labor party never have
been in office we would have had on the
coast only obsolete craft that; an armed pas-
senger boat could have licked. So men who
had never voted Labor in their lives held
their hats in their hands and drank Fisher's
health.
[C. A. .Tkkfrihr, 214 Oovsre-slroot, Sydney.1
The State Governments have risen to the
occasion and put all their shortages, over-
drafts and Public Debts at the service of
the Commonwealth. Having borrowed and
mortgaged and pawned everything in time
of peace, that is about all they can do.
What is Joseph Cook’s attitude towards
defence finance, anyhow? Early in July he
assured the Maryborough (Vic.) Farmers’
Convention that “the man was mad who
would propose to pay for defence out of
revenue.” And before a month was out he
was telling a batch of Geelong farmers that
“the statement that the Liberals were going
to borrow for defence was an outrageous
lie. They were going to pay for defence
out of revenue (Age, 31/7/’l4). Versatility,
no doubt, gives spice to a policy, but there
is a dash too much condiment about Cook’s.

THE FISCAL ASPECT.
"Tisn't often this paper displays its patriotism
in jingoistic outbursts , but our Empire-day
artist—for once allowed to fly off the handle—
manages to combine the emotional and practical
sides of warfare in dealing wilh the possible
shortage of food in England.
If the war continues for any length of
time it will give Australians some hints on
the value of Protection and on the advantage
of being a self-contained manufacturing
nation. In fact, the discoveries of the
Inter-State Commission will be nothing to
it. Australia imports quite a lot of things
which bear the words, “Made in Germany,”
and it won’t get them now for the War Ford
knows how long. Also, it sends enormous
quantities of its products—wool, leather?
tin, etc. —to Europe. These articles will
remain a drug on Australia’s hands for the
present. And when, by-and-bye, the unem-
ployed fill Collins-street (Melbourne) and
ShaTter the opulent peace of George-street;
(Sydney), it; will be small comfort for the
Commonwealth to assure itself that none cf
these unpleasantnesses need have occurred if
its politicians had instituted the real Pro-
tective tariff they were commissioned to
frame.
What a [?] of work is man! How
like an angel !— HAMLET.
Australia’s good 10s. note, which
the Private Enterprise banks tried
so hard to boycott, is at last vindi-
cated. Great Britain has decided
to issue £1 and 10s. notes in order
to ease the financial pressure while
the war lasts. It is recognised
that the humble ten-hob bit of
paper is a great stand-by at a
crisis, and if it is a good entrench-
ment in time of stress there must
be points about it. From this day
onwards, when a Bueletin man
cashes a cheque at any bank in
the Commonwealth, and isn't
offered 10s. notes in payment, -'he
will on departure paste a, hill on
the outside of the premises stating
that the institution is pro-Boer,
pro-German and anti-British. Also
ho will allege that it is a degraded
minion of Rome or Ulster, or
something to that effect.
1.1 a.ues Edmond, -11 George-street, Sydney.]
One day last week the public learned how
many people it takes to write a Sydney
Telegraph leader. The paper abandoned
its policy of refusing to comment on Federal
polities during election time, and sighed with
all pomp and ceremony—“D. I). Rralmm.
Thomas Courtney, 11. Taperell, R. L. Nash.”
The only person who didn’t sign was the
Office Cat.
Royal Commissioner Justice Bring, who
is gazing more or less learnedly at the Boora-
bil (N.S.W.) land bother, lately observed
that he was shocked :
His Honor: You said before that von were not
in the House—not in the Chamber -when the pro-
posal was discussed.
Mr, Osborne: That is so, your Honor. The vote,
however, was taken at half-past one in the morning, and
the night previous there had been an all-night sitting.
1 was not in the Chamber when the vote was dis-
cussed, and when the division bells rang' I went, I
suppose, into the Chamber and voted. Sometimes
when members rush into the Chamber to vote at the
call of the division bells they are not fully acquainted
with the question before the House.
His Honor: That" shocks my idea of a deliberative
Assembly—for its members to record a vote not
having heard the discussion.
The Judge has this paper’s sympathy. lie,
being a mere interpreter of the law, has jo
sit and listen to both sides and decide on the
facts and Ihc arguments, whereas the
superior men who make the laws decide, not
on i lie merits of proposals, but according b
whether this man or that puts ■them forward.
Why shouldn’t we go the whole party hog
and let judges find for plaintiff or defendant,
accused or prosecutor, according to the com-
plexion of the parties or the curl of the
counsels’ horsehair?
Only an idiot would
look for a George Wash-
ington in politics nowa-
days, when the party
game makes misrepresen-
tation a payable proposi-
tion, but surely Cook is
over the odds. At the
Farmers’ Conference, at
Maryborough (Vic.), he
said that the Agricultural
Bureau Bill was blocked
in the Senate. Arthur.
M.11.K. for Bendigo, fired
in a contradiction, alleg-
ing that the Senate tried
to pass the Bill, which
the Ministry held back.
Cook presently went to
Bendigo and called
Arthur the usual old
thing, adding that the
Bill was blocked in the
House of Reps, and never
saw the Senate. When
Cook arrived at Ballarat
next night he was pre-
sented with his two ver-
sions, and asked to state
which was right. As
neither was right, seeing
that tlic Bill did reach
the Senate and was very
well received there, Cook
compromised by tearing up the question.
That is statesmanship.

Only a little over a year ago. when Fisher's
referendum proposals were before the elec-
tors, every “Liberal” in the Commonwealth
was shouting that the idea of “artificially
regulating prices” was ludicrously impossible,
and if attempted would plunge the country
into chaos. But when chaos approaches a
step or two nearer than usual, the ludi-
crously impossible idea is at once embraced
by every “Liberal” among the State, Pre-

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A delusion still cherished by many
racing mugs is that Patrick McPalestine can be
beaten by “system.” There is practical unanimity
on that point, but the systems are as numerous as
tlie mugs. Backing first, second and third favorites,
or horses at a fixed price in the betting; following-
selected jockeys or stables, or (ye gods!) certain
newspaper tipsters. Writer has seen all these and
numerous other systems in operation, sometimes with,
success for a time, but they all break down at a
crucial point and leave their supporters in the mud.
All betting systems, whether for beating the books
or breaking the bank at Monte Carlo, are variations
of the “Martingale” scheme of increasing stakes,
and are based on average results. P’rinstans, the
results for a certain period show that on an average
at least one favorite wins at each race meeting. All
that is necessary is to back the first favorite, set
one’s self to win a fixed amount each day, and stake
accordingly. If you lose on the first race, increase
your stake for the second so as to get back your
loss and a profit to boot. If. the second race favorite
also goes down increase your stake for the third
race, and “keep on keeping on” till a favorite rolls
home, when all losses will be recouped and a hand-
some profit made. It is delightfully simple, and
when the average mug first comes across it he is
under the impression that he has struck a secret
entrance to the Mint. And it is absolutely sound in
theory, too, for if von keep on long enough you
must win in the end. But the sad fly in the oint-
ment is that before the end arrives the punter is up
against an inquisitive official in the Bankruptcy
Court. The breaking-point is that all systems are
based on average results, and averages are made up
of extremes (the four or five winning favorites at
one meeting are balanced by four or five meetings
without a winning favorite), and some of the ex-
tremes would smash a system backed by the Com-
monwealth Bank. As the Martingale calls for con-
stantly increasing stakes, a succession of losses
spread over two or three meetings would demand an
investment which all the bookmakers in Australia
would not handle, and the mere attempt to get it on
would knock the bottom out of the betting market
and stiffen every gee-gee in tlie race. Writer once
followed such a system (on paper), with the result
that in four weeks, at unimportant meetings, he lost
A 87,000, strictly on paper. As to following
jockeys, a friend once confided to writer that easy
money could be made by following Bolton, who was
then in winning vein. A check was kept on Bolton,
ami he struck a bad patch and bad over 50 losing
mounts in rapid succession. It is the recurrent “bad
patches” that make system betting a delusion and
a snare. The only safe system is to back them in
the mind and bank the money.
One of the Melbourne and Caulfield Cup
entrants that passed out when first-acceptances came
clue was Marculpus. A lot of people had believed in
this handsome, sluggish son of Positano as a Cup
horse of the future; but seemingly his stable connec-
tions bad proved him to be a bit of a rogue at bis
worst and a good deal overrated at his best.^
The Australian hurdle and steeple events
at the Caulfield meeting in August hay? come to be
regarded as surer tests of the season’s. form among
the jumpers than the Grand Nationals at Flemington
in July, notwithstanding that a top-notcher or two
may get. knocked out unluckily between the meetings.
The National fields, in the first place, are more or
less lumbered with rotters or half-trained nags; there
is a Tatt.’s sweep on the Hurdle Race, and owners
of hopeless outsiders are induced to start them —bv
sweep tickets. Such horses merely go to crowd the
field, causing a certain amount of interference, and.
perhaps, bringing a likely winner to
grief. And because there is a lot of
betting on “doubles” for the G.N Hurdle
and Steeple, a few hopeless candidates are
saddled up for the latter race. Weeks
previously they have been picked with tin*
winner of the Hurdle, so the holders of
the big wagers can make a bit bv hedging
if they get a run with their forlorn hope.
Therefore they offer inducements to own-
ers. In the case of the Australian Hurdle
and Steeple there is no Tatt.’s swoen, nor
much promiscuous wagering on doubles.
Consequently the fields are smaller and
more select than at Flemington. Besides,
the distances are longer, and only nags of
proved fitness are started, as a rule. This
rear the final acceptances were 11 for
the Hurdle and 10 for the Steeple,
although the prizes are £l2OO and £l3OO
for the respective winners, and 4 '300 and
£450 to be shared between the placed
horses. Result, a clean bona-fide struggle,
with every starter worth considering-—for a place,
a nyliovv.
Guncap, selected by this misguided journal
for the G. N. Steeple at Flemington, won the Aus-
tralian Steeple, at Caulfield, instead, and is now in
Ihe proud position of having captured both events
within two years: The race indicated that Zephuron
was lucky in being permitted to run away with the
Grand National a month previously. Ho took the
lead as before, but the field mostly kept within
reasonable distance of the leader, and at the finish
Zephuron was only third, a dozen lengths behind the
winner. Meanwhile two of Zeph.'s closest pursuers
had blundered out of the argument. Coradjill. who
bad not been jumping as cleanly as usual, fell at
one of the far-off fences in the second round when
lie was second in command. Battleship was running
second in the third round, when he touched the logs
with his hind hoofs and tilted his jockey out of the
saddle. The horse went on gaily enough, whilst the
hoy was deploring the foolishness of sending a “good
thing” on such a long journey without having given
him sufficient practice over the incidental obstacles.
Hp to the moment when he lost his rider. Battleship
looked a certainty bar accidents. He had warmed to
bis' work, and was full of go, but his fencing was
not invariably safe.

Of the flat-race winners at the recent
Caulfield meeting Wishing Cap looked most likely to
annex a big handicap in the Swing. A i-lovv beginner
but a fine, determined finisher is Wishing Cap (in
Phil Hevwood’s stable), and having been let into
Melb. Cup at the bottom weight a few pounds’
penalty will not matter. Judging by his work in
mile races one would expect the son of Fortunatus
to prove himself a stayer later on.

“Galloway”: Disregard of the King's
English led to a peck of trouble at the Moorefield
(N.S.W.) on Bank Holiday. The Exchange Stakes
were for horses whose owners had not won a flat
race, 50 sovs. or over. Any number of mem—George
Reid, for example—never attempted a flat race or
even a trout-fishing competition. Owners, trainers,
bookies, punters and sports generally rushed to the
conclusion that the remark about the flat race referred
to the particular gee-gee nominated, though, obvi-
ously, that interpretation was incorrect from a literal
po«it of view. The club authorities scent to have
tumbled to the illegality of many of the nomina-
tions before the race was run, but nothing was done
until after it was over, when the first and third
past the post were disqualified, to the consternation
of everyone bar backers of the second horse. Punters’
grievance is that the race club should not have
accepted nominations which called for disqualification
on the accepted wording of the rules, and argue that
if the committee really meant the .4:50 limit to
apply to the steed and not to the owner, the clause
was absurdly' drafted. They also want the race
cancelled and re-run, but the club decided that they
could get work.
“O.Tv.”: London Referee. talking of
cricket in June, said: “llubbs lias a delightful way of
following one great innings with another. Against
Es-sex, at the beginning of the week, he made the
highest score of his life —21 f* not out. On Friday
he scored 108 against Hampshire. If he can go on
like Ibis his benefit match at the Oval in August may-
be the biggest thing of its kind we have ever had in
the South of England.” This is August, but the
South of England is not greatly concerned about any-
body’s benefit match. Ever hear the gramophone
record of C. B. Fry proposing the toast of Cricket?
“I foresee the day when, through Cricket, all the
nations will he at peace: when the only cannon
balls will be ‘Wisden s specials.’ Gentlemen, 1 give
you Cricket—the bond of union, the basis of under-

W. TT. Fagan, ex-bookmaker, of the old
school, has made his last wager—and lost. He was
perhaps the only Australian bookie on record who
could pronounce correctly the names of all the horses
he laid against. He had had a fine classical educa-
tion in Ireland—he said he had been intended for the
priesthood. He was intimate with Joe Thompson,
.J. J. Miller, Eli Jcllett, Saqui, and all the old
Bohemian lot, and was a mine of good stories of the
past. All his later years he went lame, as the result
of an injury received in the wrestling ring long ago.
In a week or so. when details begin to
dribble through the censored press, we shall hear
something of the part that motor traction played in
the wild rush of the German legions for the French
frontier. Already the dazed and staggering cable
has told how the German raiders first secured all
the motor vehicles they found in the French towns
and villages. The Teutonic General Staff has devoted
considerable attention to motor traction, and when
the war commenced had 120 automobile road trains,
each capable of carrying 660 tons of freight. In
addition, there are also 860 subsidised motor-lorries.
The motor road-trains were capable of anything
between six and 10 miles an hour, according to the
state of the roads, inclines, etc. Britain holds the
right to commandeer every motor vehicle in the
country for war purposes, and there are 426,000 on
the register, of which some 70,000 odd arc motor-
bikes. This is equal to one for every 249 of the
population. France has about 100,000 cars, or one
to every 441 people. Germany is not so well off, and
has oniy one to every 927 people.
The writer, being a modest, diffident sort of party,
would hate to tell any General Staff how to conduct
its business; hut it seems to his innate genius that
the military world has never properly appreciated the
possible value of the armored motor-car, carrying,
say, a dozen riflemen and a couple of machine guns,
Such a car, with armored walls capable of resisting
rifle lire, could charge right up to a hostile line, and
let loose sudden eternity from a couple of death-dealing
hoses. A dozen such cars would be a very awkward
problem for even a battalion to bump against in open
country. Field artillery would he the only arm such
a squadron would have to fear. Australia has a
goodly crowd of high-powered cars which could he
easilv armored, and if the War Lord Milieu was to

The amateur billiard championship of
South Aus. has changed hands. Angelo Demodena,
mandoline expert, was- the first holder, having just
beaten, last year, the Glenelg lacrosse player, Cooper.
This time, S. P. Wilson, from Mannum, on the
Murray, visited the city, and, after beating all other
comers, put Demodena down —1000 to 871. Then lie
took 150, in an exhibition 750, from the State's
best professional, and won by 500. Wilson is to be
seen in Sydney shortly.
Dead at Geelong (Vic.) B. B. Cooper,
who flourished in inter-State cricket in the 70's of
last century. He learned his game in' England, and
had partnered W. G. Grace in run-getting; was a
good wicketkeeper, and in his day one of the best
bats in Australia. His highest notch against the
Ma State was 45 J but in the times of Cosstick,
Campbell, T. J. I). Kelly, Gregory, Coates, Thompson,
Evans and Sheridan, they were big figures. His first
inter-State game (1871) was the last that Caffvn,
the cx-Suvreyjtc, appeared in. Caffvn, by the way,
still holds out, at Reigate (Eng.).
Maoriland sculling championship squabble
between Paddy Hannan and William Webb has
reached something like finality. Webb has sent the
reply to Hannan that less than £2OO a-side isn’t
worth bothering about, and that if the blustering
Paddy wants a match he will have to bog in at that
figure. As Hannan has had trouble over the stake-
money, Webb,'of Wanganui, seems on safe ground.
N.S.W. Amateur Athletic Association is
still in the throes of a monetary upheaval. So,
with a view to representation in the Australasian
cross-eon r, try championship in Victoria, the Ass,
has imposed a levy of (id. per athlete in the coming
N.S.W. five- and ten-mile events. The Association
will possibly get about sufficient to send two ath-
letes ; while the clmr.ee ot teams making (I trip Will
depend on the depths of their own pockets. It is
a sorry position for the N.S.W. A.A.A., anyhow.
Sydney lacrosse semi-finals on Saturday
were stirring. The clash between Sydney and East-
ern Suburbs was worth enthusing over, aim Sydney,
with its nose to the wheel, just struggled out by
four goals to three. At half-way Sydney led by
four to two. and though the Easts piled on another
goal in tiie final quarter they fell within sight of
victory. In the other match Petersham had a hard
race with Balmain in the (irsi half, ultd led by five
goals lo four: but thereafter the sca-sidet's
crumbled, and Peter won by nine to live. Sydney and
Peter will provide the music in the final oil the
coming week-end.
The cyclist who contemplates gathering
Australasian and international championships during
the coming season will have it fair area to disport
himself over. The burying of the axe has brought six
states aid Maoriland together hi one fold, and a
dozen championships Will he divided among them.
Mil, Victoria, South Australia and Maori land will
control two events each, while Tasmania and Queens-
land will take one apiece. Evidently cycling is deter-
mined to boom (or burst) during the coming. season.
The Summer Baseball Association is gel-
ting ill earlv with a mighty hustle, and begging
of everybody to stand clear and see what, they shall
see. flood, large crowds were drawn to the summer
baseball games last season, and the SUVA, threatens
to make, this time,, a bigger splash than ever and
a more attractive one. To push the Yankee game in
summer, and more especially to foster it among the
young, the association is forming a limited liability
company. A provisional directorate has already been
formed, and the capital is to I e £5OO0 —a very
modest sum —in 25,000 shares ot 4s. PttChi It is
proposed to provide tools or instruments of play and
uniforms free for the young brethren, and to allow
them use of the grounds rent, free. Whether all this
is being done for the benefit of the game or the
welfare of the promoters Is hard to say.

Tne wind lip of the Inter-State baseball
carnival at Petersham (Sydney), bn Saturday, was
another disaster for the visitors. N.S.W. bailers, in
rare fettle, crumpled Victoria by 10 to one, While a
second team pounded S. Australia by 10 to nil. Ihe
opposition i>Ut up a Vel*y popv fi£nt itl both matches,
and bati-ackers—-who. generally havfe an uproarious
time—never ruffled their mouths. In the previous
mid-week Victoria surprised itself by defeating N.S.W.
by three runs to one, and N.S.W. downed S. Aus. by
nine to six. The four days' rumpus, therefore, gave
N.S.W. the rubber with four wins against Victoria s
two. while S. Aus. could only account for one victim.
In the schools matches N.S.W. lads reaped a harvest
by monping up Victoria by 13 to six, and demolish-
ing S.' Australia bv 10 to nil. and throughout the
carnival never tasted the gall and wormwood Of
defeat. The Inter-State blow out throughout was
more docile than the family hat;; while the absence

The chief excitement in Sydney League
Rugbv on Saturday Was the struggle between South
Sidney, the leader iii the. competition,' aha Newtown,
the crowd that, the previous Saturday, had been so
ignominiousiy defeated by the brilliant but IncOH-
sistent Balmain team. Oh paper Newtown was a
chopping block, a teahl predestinated to slops and
deeapitatibn. But On the fifeid it, Was a vastly
different proposition—a sturdy band with first-clasS
combination and good kicking powers. When half-
time arrived it led by five to three. South Sydney
pulled itself together in theory, and the captain of
the team addressed a few vehement remarks to the
units of the back machine, and also exhorted the
forwards to put more devil into it. The exhorta-
tions failed, and there was no devil. Before the
ordered fury and systematic madness of the New-
townians South Sydney could not prevail, and at hist
could not. hold its own. When darkness came down
South Sydney fell with it. outed by 12 to eight after
a game in which it never had a chance. “So passeth
earthly glory 1” Eastern Suburbs had a strenuous
struggle- with North Sydney on the latter's oval. East
piled up• 1-1 points to nil in thy first half, but in
the second half the home team caught up without the
invaders scoring once, and it looked a certain draw.
A lucky field goal, however, just on time made it a
victory for Eastern Suburb- by 13 to 11. Balmain
and Glebe wrestled and perspired on Wentworth Park,
and did it so hard that several players had to he
carried off. But the remnant toiled on, and when
the whistle sounded for peace the score was five all.
Western Suburbs hist managed to down Annandale by
six to four. South Sydney’s downfall does not deprive
it of its pride of place. It is still first in the coin-
petition, bv one point from Newtown, which has 18.
Eastern Suburbs lias 16: Glebe lias 13; Balmain, the
erratic, has 12: and North Sydney is stuck at 11.
The rest hardly matter. They are lost in the haze
of insignificance.

The Union branch of Sydney Rugby was
held up owing to the presence of the All Blacks, who
were to meet N. S. Wales on the Sports Ground.
They did. They came, they passed. They triumphed.
N.S.W. won the toss, and the Maorilanders kicked off
against the lightest of breezes with the rays of old
Sol shining straight into their large, soft, dog-like
eyes. It was strenuous from the jump, and some of
the tackling was vimful. Three Cornstalks unfolded
a passing charge, which struck the visitors as about
the most hideous sight seen in Australia, but the
Maorilanders managed to block it, although the same
three came again, and still once more. The best
defence is to attack. Maoriland let loose a charge,
and after lOmin. of desperate work scored a try. It
was followed by a second, but owing to the inability
of this crowd of Maorilanders to kick, neither try
was converted. Still, inability to kick seems to be
their only weakness. Three times in the first half
they scored tries, and failed to convert any of them.
N S.W. scored one try, converted it gracefully, and
right on half-time potted as neat a goal as one
could wish to see. Maoriland was-nine to seven. In
the second half the Blacks woke up, put their ears
back, and tucked their hind legs under. And after
that Australia just melted, like snow in the glance of
the Lord, like Germans before Belgian machine guns,
like cool beer in a weary land; and the final figures
were 25 to 10. Brethren, let us draw a veil over
the awful proceedings. Let us forget the harrowing
details.

In the N.S.W. Soccer division Granville
smashed up Glebe by four to nil. Glebe is weak in
the Spccer game, but it was too strong for the
frantic attacks of Granville till the second half.
Then it crumpled in three pieces, and- the iron-
workers Stamped the butchers flat. Northern Suburbs
had a big- streak of luck in defeating Annandale by
two to nil, for the Scottish-titled team put up a
very stirring struggle. But a streak of luck in both
halves made the wild hillmen from North Sydney,
where daffodils grow, the lions of the day. Balmain
opened proceedings against Canterbury by charging
right through and netting a goal in short order. It
did the .same trick again in the second round, anti
then fauterbiirv took a leaf out of the hook. I'irrit
time ran out before the second leaf could be torn*
away, and Balmain was on top with two goals- to
one. Sydney and Newtown had. a great struggle, lint
which Newtown started the offensive at a gallop : ftufc
was pulled up in short order by a very
defence. Newtown did some damage, to wit, tlmee
goals ; but Svdne.v scored four.

The Melbourne football Leaguei-a being
away 111 Sydney. Some 35,000 mostly disinterested
spectators viewed the concussion of North and FisSeii-
don and ’Scrav arid ’Tflwil in the As-;, semi-fiilais.
The public mostly follows League hoofhall, an I it
came in anticipation and went away in disgust.
Tiie Ass. plays 10 men in place of 18, and the
League patrons’ idea was that the game would prove
more open, and therefore brighter to look at, but
the smaller “field” made no difference. The teams
merely abolish one back and one forward, and carry
ns numerous n “ruck” as the League, which im-
proves the game no whit. In the play North proved
to be swifter and cleverer than ’Don, and it pos-
sessed a decent system. By the end of the first
quarter the issue was beyond doubt. Ultimately
North collected 80 points to ’Don's 58. The 'Scrav-
’Town scuffle ended even more disastrously for ’Town
—-30 points to ’Scray’s 00—-but here the spectators
got at least all hour’s atnusemeht for their shilling'.

Sydney life Did he never hear of Peter Jackson, of
Slavic. of Jem Hall. Bob Fitzsimmons, Griffo and a
cloud of others? Well, if not, he had better buy him
a book, and if it is a good truthful book he will
learn from it that they fought at the Old White
Horse, And flue fights' they put up, too! There
Were champions on the earth in those days. And I
taught them. “Pendragon,” the famous English box-
ing scribe, came to the While Horse, and when he
saw my pupils in fighting gear, and beheld them in
action, he dropped his notebook and, when he picked
it Up again, he wrote in it that a teacher like Mr.
Foley came only once in a hundred years, and some-
times skipped a century. “D.” says boxing, before
Mclntosh came, was carried on chiefly in the pre-
sence of the criminal classes. Rubbish! Also, tut,
tut! Why, Lord Carrington and his staff were regu-
lar habituffs of the White Horse, belted earl and all
as he Was. Septimus Stephen, and all the rest of
tiie elite came in his train, and whenever anybody
of importance was not to be found at home nor in
his office it was safe betting that he was at the
White Horse. There were no criminal classes round
the White Horse. And the fights we had there were
historic, the company that, attended them was bril-
liant, and the liquor wc drank was true to label
and of t.be best brands.”

The scrap between Jimmy Tlill. the hard-
bitting. sprightly Sydney youth, and Frank Thorn, the
ancient of boxing days, on Saturday night, at the Syd-
ney Stadium, was to have been for the “featherweight”
championship of the continent, but as they both
exceeded the weight limit it became "a common or
ordinary garden scrap. Thorn weighed 9st. 41b. and
Hill was 9st. 3Jib. It was not till the 14th
round that either side gained any advantage, but
during that session Hill was down twiie, and all
but out. He managed to weather the gale, owing
chiefly to the fact that Thorn, who is a teacher of
boxing, could not bring himself to go in, in ruthless
pursuit of the main chance, and punish and finish
a semi-helpless man. His clemency cost him some
money that night. Hill, with his glorious gift of
youth, recuperated quickly, and came back and shook
up very severely for a few seconds the man who
bad spared him. At the end of the mill referee
Fred Baker placed a hand on each bright, head.
The declaration of a draw received the mixed recep-
tion that is becoming a regular habit of the
Stadium habitues. Although this writer would
prohablv have given the verdict .to Thorn had he
been referee, the decision was a sound one. The
men who hooted were like this scribe, prejudiced in
favor of Thorn, with his hard old face and kindly
eves, like a picture from Grimm’s Fairy Tales.
He has been so long in the game. TTo is such a
marvellous survival. As far back as this writer
can remember taking a professional interest in scrap-
ping, Francis Thorn was scrapping gaily. He lias:
seen about three generations of boxers come and ao.
and. like the blessed brook, he goes on for ever, and
he still hits as hard and as quickly as he did in his
infancy. Age has not impaired his speed. Clever
Jimmy Hill had no guard on Saturday night for
the old man's straight left. No matter what Hi 1 !
did Thorn Hit him. and kept on doing it. When Thorn's
sawn-off-looking figure appears in the ring there is
a sentimental regard for him in the heart of ever'
ancient ringsider which makes it hard to write
impartially about him. Everybody who knows
him and remembers him wants to see him win. Tl
cheers one up to see the young and rising genera-
tion licked occasionally bv the old stagers—when
one; begins to feel an old stager himself.

Novel Method for
Waving the Hair.
TOILET TALKS.
MANY a charming face is spoiled by
straight, lank, and excessively greasy
hair. Naturally curly hair gives a most
delightful effect even to a plain face, a fact
which has unfortunately been known for
many years. This knowledge alone has re-
sulted in the ruination of thousands of heads
of beautiful hair by slow torture from that
terrible instrument, the curling iron. Im-
agine, if you can, how the living hair squirms
and twists under such treatment Yet this
is the very result you aim at. Well. 1 have
no doubt that each one individually is of the
opinion that the results justify
tin' meas, but let me tell you
that the reckoning will have to
he paid, and in a manner which
will be far from pleasant. The
twists and curls created by the
hot iron are the hairs’ dying con-
tortions, and it is only a question
of lime when you will have no
hair left to torture. If it is
absolutely necessary to have
wavy hair, then there is a far
more simple and harmless pro-
cess which any woman may
adopt without fear as to the
results, (let from your chemist
two ounces of silmerine, and
pour about two tablespoonfuls into a saucer.
With a cleiln toothbrush apply this to the
hair upon retiring. You will be quite
amazed at the result, and one application
will last for many days. Damp weather
need have no terrors for you if you take
these simple precautions, and straight, wispy
tails will be converted into tight little curls,
giving a charming and pretty effect, even to
a plain face.
Noth. Silmerine has not been used to any
extent for this purpose, but most chemists
keep a small supply in stock.
NOW about shampoos. Is it reasonable
ter expect, that one particular make will
suit everybodyV ’ 'Certainly not. Some
ĥ
folks have dry and brittle hair, others have
tresses which are excessively greasy. Each
requires a different grade of shampoo, if one
is to obtain the best results. The writer’s
notice' was recently brought to a substance
called stallax, which can be obtained from
most chemists. It consists of small gran?
ules. which, when mixed with a cup of hot
water, make the most charming mixture
imaginable for shampooing the hair. Ac-
cording to the quantity used, so the strength
is graduated to suit all conditions. There
is one drawback, however, and that is stallax
can only be obtained in {lb. tins,
which cost about half-a-erown,
but as this quantity is sufficient
to make 25 to lit) shampoos, it
is really very economical in the
end. It leaves the hair a little
too wavy and fluffy for some
tastes, but this can always be
avoided by rubbing a little olive
oil on the scalp previous to its
application.
AFJ3YV remarks on face
creams may not be out o f
place, and at the risk of being
put down as a little old-fash-
ioned, my advice on this subject
is to leave well alone. Do not
clog the pores with greasy concoctions
which not only prevent the skin from
performing its proper functions, but
usually result in encouraging a growth
of hair on the face, and you know
very well what that means —disfigure-
ment for the rest of your natural days.
If it is necessary to use an emollient at
all. get some mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply in the usual way.
This remarkable substance seems to absorb
the worn and weatherbeaten outer cuticle,
and in a few days’ time the new, healthy
skin underneath peeps forth _in all its
brilliance, and is, of course, quite free from
i iin'erfection or blemish. [1

A return recently tabled in Maoriland
Parliament threw light on the growth of the worship
of the horse. For the year ended March 31, 1910,
the Government raked in £29,855 3s. 4d, on a 11
per cent, totalisator tax. Then the tax was increased
to 21 per cent., and this is the way the heap has
swelled since:—
Year ended March 31, 1911 .. £54,714 15 1
„ ~ 1912 . . 75,294 14 5
„ „ 1913 .. 88,629 2 6
„ „ 1914 . . 100,131 18 10
This means that, for the year ended March 31, 1914,
the money put through the machine must have aggre-
gated about £4,000,000. Maoriland is a small place
compared to Australia or even N. S. Wales, so just
consider what sort of a time must the bookmakers
of Sydney and Melbourne have; and what sort of
revenue are Peacock and Holman throwing away by
allowing the bag-carrier to receive the punters’ cash
instead of a legalised totalisator?
An effort is being made in Maoriland to
alter the system of handicapping and starting trot-
ting events. At present the handicapping is by
seconds. All the horses start from the same mark,
the limit horse getting away first and the scratch
nag so many seconds later. The prads really start
some distance back, aid move tip to the mark at
racing pace. Good judgment is required on the
driver's part not to get across the line too early
or too late. This system lias led to endless trouble
and bungling, for, with a big field one bad-tempered
horse is sufficient to turn the whole arrangement into
chaos. Now many sporting men are yelling for
handicapping by distance. This means that a nag
gels so many yards in a mile, is placed on its mark
by the starter like an athlete, and gets away from
a standing start. If the prad gets left no one is tjo
blame but the beast, and the driver. Also, it is not
possible for one hucephalus to gain an.unfair advan-
tage. The only objection (o the proposed method lies
in the fact that it gives hobbled pacers a distinct
advantage over pure trotters. The hobbled horse, of
course, would get a catapult start, and would strike
his gait quicker than a free and ‘pure trotter. The
solution of that difficulty seems to be to put the
hobbled freak in a class by himself. That’s where
lie should be.
Tlio Australian Half-mile Flying Start
Motor Cycle Road Record was originally estab-
lished at 26 l-ssec. by E. 10. Kester, of South Aus-
tralia. It was equalled by 13. Mayman, of Victoria,
and last week the same deed was done by a
Westralian named If. Wigmore, on a 7-h.p Twin
machine/ The ride was electrically timed, and
works out at 681 miles per hour.
The previous holder of the Adelaide to
Broken Hill motor-car record, M. S. A. Cheney, of
Adelaide, declines to be pushed into a back place by
Murray Aungcr, who spurted over the 323 miles in
nine hours and 48min. So very shortly he will make
an attack on Aungcr.’s figures. A linger drove a 35-
li.p. Overland. Cheney will again use his Ford.
Absolutely the most expensive motor-car
in the world is (according to the Auto-Car year-
book, which gives a complete list of names and
prices) an Italian make —-£1650 for the chassis
alone. The body is not included. If you are an
Indian prince, or an American multimillionaire, you
may have the upper works made of gold, set with
rubies, and painted by Sargent, so no quotations are
given for those. For £1650 you just get the run-
ning-part, of a 50-h p. Itala, four cylinders, rotary
valve, four gears. The makers thoughtfully add that
for this sum they include the tyres.
Melbourne motor hogs who mow down
pedestrians not sufficiently agile to vault over a tram and
thus get out of danger have had the law of negligence
defined for them by Justice Hodges. A woman was
recently ordered to contribute £ 5 for “having driven
a motor-car negligently, having regard to all the
circumstances, including the nature, conditions and
use of the highway and the amount of traffic which
might lie expected to be on such highway.” The
irate offender applied for an order to review, .con-
tending that the information disclosed no offence.
Justice Hodges, however, indicated that he had no
doubt about the law of the game of ninepins. No
person was civilly liable for negligence, he remarked,
unless somebody was injured ; but the Motor Act had
been stretched further, so as to deal the knock-out
to nice ladies .and kind gentlemen whose negligence
merely endangered those who dared to use the same
highway as they and their motor-ears.
Cycling is the sport at which man lasts
longest. Take the case of Paul Guignard, the crack
French pace-follower, also said to be the wealthiest
cyclist in the world. He has held the world’s record
for the paced hour since 1909, when he blew over
63 miles 255vds. He is now 40 years of age, and
is said to be riding as well as ever. He is reported
to have saved over £30,000 from his winnings and
the big retaining fees he draws. The only man who
has earned anything like this amount from racing is
Frank Kramer, the Yankee speed king, who has. been
practically invincible in America for a full decade.

No wonder the cow’s husband’s brother is
threatening to become extinct. It is stated that in
the United States alone this year £2,000,000 worth
of leather will be required in the automobile indus-
try. The average ear requires two and a half com-
plete hides, while touring cars take three whole
animals’ coverings. Some ass with a mania for
statistics h s worked out that the total area of
leather required will be 50,000,000 square feet,
which, cut into a band wide, would circle the
earth at the equator. The average cost to the auto-
mobile industry is about lOd. per square foot. Auto-
mobile upholstery is made almost exclusively from
the pelts of steers.
Like other sidelights of amateurism,
N.S.W. Rowing Association had a financial struggle
last season. The Association dropped £27 7s. 3d.,
which is rather too much boodle to slip out of the
coffers in one year. Another straw for the camel’s
back was a titbit in the annual report: “It was,
however, regretted that the standard of oarsmanship
of immediately preceding years had not been main-
tained.” That gibe stuck pretty hard in the gizzards
of members of the Association, and the matter is
thrown to a conference of the various club coaches.
It is asked to find out how to again exalt the tail
of the pastime.
A girl who has just arrived from Europe
writes: Aristocrat, plutocrat and even the superior
person are all running after the pugilist, and more
so when he has, like lovely Georges Carpentier, the
head of an Apollo and the figure we alwaj r s ascribe
to Samson. The latter, unfortunately, did not live
near a photographic establishment and had no sculp-
tors in his push. “Le Boxe” is the last word in
the correct thing according to used-up Europe. And
it is the society daines who are first outside the ropes
after the beautiful boxer. Their troubles about a
great White Hope. Theirs the pursuit—on their own
—of the white hope with temptations and flatter-
ing?. that would turn the head of a statue of St.
Antony. It was Hugh D. Mclntosh who must bear
the blame, for he set the fashion when he had the
first row boxes occupied mostly by duchesses at the
Olympia to see the golden-haired Bombardier Well?
and other lovely specimens of the male form divine.
How they gloated over the rippling of the smooth,
sun-tanned skin above the muscles as the gladiators
leaped and bounded about the ring. Gloves were
svilit in tlie frantic applause, and when the claret
flew, as it sometimes did, there were little shrieks
if it was the right man's blood; but the sight of
the wrong man's gore sometimes roused savage
battle screams such as the Valkyries might have
uttered when they waded into the scrap.

'“Moana” : Invercargill, the old prohibition
town of Maoriland, maintains three
breweries just across the boundaries
that divides it from the "wet" area.
These breweries have to pay excise
duty on every gallon of brown ruin
they brew, so the official returns for the
year ended June 30 give some idea of the
thirst that rages in no-license
districts. There are about 15,000 people i.n
Invercargill, and the moisture that flowed
in from the local serpent factories amounted
to 137,094 gallons, or about 84 gallons per
head of population, including men, women
and children. The beer is made up in casks
and jars of from 56 gallons down to two
gallons'. The handy two-gallon keg has re-
placed the casual pint that used to be pur-
chased at the open bar, Added to the fore-
going figures there is the great quantity of
beer from Dunedin, Christchurch, Auck-
land and Britain that is imported into Inver-
kegville. For the month of June alone
this totalled 10.244 gallons, which is equal
to about another eight gallons per head per
annum, bringing the total swallowed to
over 164 gallons per inhabitant. As more
than half are teetotallers (women, children
and others) the other half must put away
over 33 gallons of beer each per annum.
Then there's the whusky, and mighty is
whusky in any Scawtch community. Alto-
gether No-License seems to be a great and
glorious institution for the breweries and
for the individual with a chronic thirst.
Thirty-three gallons of moist beer per annum
per drinking inhabitant. Let us rejoice,
brethren, and hiccup mightily before the
Lord.
.
“J.P.": Tiie saddlery trade is dying in
Maoriland because of an idiotic interpreta-
tion that is being put upon the Protective
tariff. A heavy duty faces imported "Manu-
factured Saddlery,” i.e., anything that is
absolutely finished ; but if a saddle is brought
ashore with one buckle left off, purposely
and conspicuously, the article is allowed to
pass in free. The result of lunacy of this
kind is that lOU Land’s saddles are being
made in Germany or Timbuctoo. while the
saddlers of M.L. are getting a little employ-
ment at sewing on a few buckles now and
again. I don’t know what Minister, for
Customs Fisher proposes to do about it.
You seo> lie’s busy rounding up votes for the
coming elections, and there are hardly any
saddlers in his electorate.
It is an evidence of the cussedness of
inanimate objects that the World’s Peace
Congress was to have met at Vienna in
September. Now the World’s Peace Con-
gress is off, because some of its members
have taken their rifles and hurried to the
frontier, and because the railways are wanted
for the conveyance of troops, so that the
balance of the Congress would probably have
to hoof its way to the scene of deliberation.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
The man wlio managed the N.S.W. Centenary
dinner (January 26, 1888) recently stated that Henry
Parkes, with a wave of the hand, gave horders that
no hexpense was to be spared. And none was—
the banquet cost, all told, close on £5OOO. But a
still more expensive dinner than that was eaten in
Australia. In January, 1865, the Confederate
steamer Shenandoah put into Port Phillip, ostensi-
bly for repairs, but really to do a bit of recruiting.
The United States Consul appealed to the Govern-
ment to prevent any assistance being given to the
rebel vessel, and especially to stop the departure of
locally-enlisted men. He wished to lay an infor-
mation, and endeavored to obtain warrants against
them. Unfortunately, instead of going before a
magistrate, lie went to the Crown Law Offices. The
Attorney-General was not there, and the Consul,
meeting the Crown Solicitor, ‘ Henry Field Gromer, a
Sydney native, was told, abruptly, to go to. a. magis-
trate. The Consul promptly complained" that the
Crown Solicitor bad insulted .‘him. The Crown Solici-
tor: <‘l positively assert that neither in language ror
manner did I insult- him. 1 was in a hurry to catch
the train, and may perhaps have left more suddenly
than I should have done.” On the other hand, the
U.S. gentleman who accompanied the Consul de-
scribed Mr. Cromer’s manner as sneering and in-
sulting, his words being: “1 don’t care; I want my
dinner,” and lie hurried away. In the books of the
period in the U.S. Consulate at Melbourne, a mar-
ginal note was afterwards made: “Henry Field
Cromer’s dinner cost the British Government four
million pounds sterling.” This is an exaggeration,
certainly; for the entire money paid by Britain for
Alabama, Shenandoah and Florida claims was three
and a quarter millions, though the Costs were enor-
mous. To get to the milk in the cocoanut, you
must remember that Gromer was a leading member
of the Melbourne Club, which had feted and ban-
queted Captain Waddell and the officers of. the
Shenandoah.
“O.” : The armed merchant ship displaces
the old privateer. That freebooter, with all
its evil associations, was banished by the
first article of the Declaration of Paris,
1850, so far as all the great Powers, except
the United States, are concerned ; and most
of the small States have followed the great
Powers. But though the armored merchant-
ship has displaced the privateer, it is not
the old thing under a new name. The
privateer was used wholly for private gain.
It was subject to no Government control and
was free ’from all naval discipline. The
affhored merchant ship, <>n the other hand
becomes a warship, with the rights Und
liabilities attaching to that classification ;
and the commander's name must appear on
the list of officers of the war fleet. If Britain,
for instance, converts a merchant ship into
a warship it must as soon as possible
announce the conversion and include the
vessel in the list of the ships (if the fighting
fleet. Thereupon the merchantman becomes
a public vessel and flies the flag of the Navy.
From that hour it cannot claim the pro-
tection of a neutral port sis a merchant
ship can. It cannot be a warship one day
and a merchant ship the next. As to the
precise hour when it may change its status
and resume its old rights there is no full
agreement. For instance, it is disputed
whether it can change on the high seas.
Great Britain, Japan and Italy say No.
France, Germany and Russia say Yes. Ger-
many holds that if a merchant ship changes
to a warship it must stay a warship till the
end of the campaign. Other States are not-
clear on the point. Under Admiralty direc-i
tio 11s British merchant ships are armed only
for defence and resistance; they are not
intended to be aggressive. If at any time
it is decided to make them aggressive, they
must be formally converted and commis-
sioned as warships.

Like the rest of them, Digby Denham has
been ready these last few days to knock 47
devils out of Germany. It is a pity he
hadn’t previously thought of the possibility ;
of having to take a hand in this job. For
instance, if Denham hadn’t fed. Germany
with recent contracts for the Bremer bridge
and other works, when Australians were
hungry to get them, there would have been
only 46 devils to knock out; and in the last
resort the last devil is a d—l of a lot.
Two interesting slabs of evidence given
before the Meat Commission at Brisbane: —
EDWARD H. MACARTNEY, solicitor for the Aus-
tralian Meat Export Company, said the company had
never in any way, direct or indirect, contributed any
money through him to any political body. He knew
that the A.M.E. Company had never approved or
agreed to contribute a subsidy to a political organ-
isation. The A.M.E. never contributed any sum to
any political organisation. Hd had no knowledge of
any contribution for political purposes by the A.M.E.
Company. It was the policy of the company not to
take any side in politics.
Later on Digby Denham wandered into the
limelight and told his little piece. It was
brief but interesting:—
Digby Frank Denham, Premier of Queensland, stated
that he had no official position with a political
organisation controlling the State elections. He had
never at any time received from the A.M.E. Company,
or Swift and Companv, or anybody connected with
them, money for political or any other purposes.
Before the last Federal campaign he had received an
intimation from MR. E. 11. MACARTNEY that some
Liberal friend in New South Wales would subsidise
contributions to the Liberal funds in Queensland by
£2 to £1 uo to £2OOO. He advised the trustees
of the fund to collect the subsidy on the amount
collected, £9OO. In due course he received a cheque
on a Sydney bank, which he deposited in the bank.
The money came from New South Wales.
Seems to be too much Macartney.
“Hamilton Reach” : This is the story of a
loyalist who was imposed upon. One day
when the contingents were being organised
and sent away to the Baratarian War, a
citizen named Poddle had nine drinks (eight
would have been quite enough) and hurried
along to the barracks. Though usually a
retiring man, he burst into the place, asking
one soldier after another for a colonel with
whom he hadn’t the slightest acquaintance.
Once inside he started to search feverishly
for some job whereby he could help the
Empire. Nobody took any notice of him for
a time, but presently a military-looking
young man seized his arm as he went to hurry
past and said searchingly: “Do you want to
do something?” Poddle, who hadn’t the slight-
est idea he was making a nuisance of him-
self, stuck out his chest and replied with
proud fervor that he was ready to do any-
thing— any thing at all. He added that he
didn’t care what it was —all he wanted was
to be led to it. “Right!” said the young
man, and directed Poddle to follow him out
of the barrack gate. Poddle did so and
marched proudly after his guide until be
halted two blocks away, at the open gate of
a yard. “See that wood?” asked the guide,
pointing to a healthy-looking stack. “Yes,
sir,” said Poddle. “Well,” said the guide,
“that’s the General’s wood. He starts to-
night for the front and he doesn’t want his
wife to chop it. Will you do that for him?”
“Certain-ly, sir,” said Poddle, and, marching
AFTER HOURS.
THE C ONSTABLE: “I saw you come out of that side door just now."
THE DRUNK: “Yesh. Do you (hie) know who I am?”
THE C ONSTABLE: “No."
THE DRUNK: “Then how did you know it was me."
to the woodheap, began work. He had
smashed several large blocks when he heard
the band in the parade ground strike up
“God Save the King.” He put down the
axe, stood to attention and began to sing
lustily, keeping time as -best he - could.
Presently a window shot up and an angry
voice shouted, “Hey! what are you singing
in my yard for?” Poddle wheeled round and
saluted. “I’m chopping the General’s
wood, dr.” “Who asked you to do it?”
roared the face at the window. “I didn’t
ask you to chop the wood!” A horrible look
of suspicion suffused the countenance and it
added, “I don’t believe you came in to chop
the wood at all! I believe you came in to
steal the fowls! No! don’t you think you
can stall me off by singing ‘God Save the
King’! You only did that because you saw
me coming! Now you clear out before 1
ring up for the police —go on, now!" Poddle
was too dazed to argue. He tottered from
the yard a broken-hearted man. But he
often wondered afterwards what vindictive
soldier it was got him the job.
The Jest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Over the whirl of the star-dust,
Far in the measureless ether,
Ruling on high on his crystalline throne,
Sat Jahveh —the Jahveh of Moses and
Aaron,
Wearied of cherubic Hail and Hosanna,
Jahveh, the Jester of Old!'
Under him systems were flickering, dying,
Others were launched into being;
Just like a speck was the one we call Solar,
Just like a spark in the Vast and the Vague-
ness ;
Yet in its infinite littleness
Far on the verge did the Maker espy it
And to his henchman Archangel,
Michael, he said :
“Michael! The Monads who people yon sys-
tem,
Or who are lords of a mite of it,
They whom we made for a joke in our weari-
ness,
Planted one day on a pitiful pilule,
Sent it then spinning along with the
myriads,
Myriads of others that flash in the Nothing-
ness, . .
What, in the name of the Humors of Cosmos,
What do they do to amuse Us Who made
them,
There in the Night?”
“Lord!” answered Michael, “Last even I
listened,
As I was sweeping the borders of Sol
And, by the virtue of patience angelic,
And of the latest celestial invention,
Which, as You know, now empowers a seraph
To hearken to sounds of incredible smallness,
Down to the 50-quadrillionth part of,
The tiniest tone of the tiniest Cherub
Here in our Heaven —
listened, I say, till I heard a wee piping
Rise in the air that the Monads must breathe
(As t’was ordained by the Maker of Monads
And the Creator of Pilules).
And by the virtues of High Understanding
Clearly I followed the Creature—his mean-
ing,
Aye—and his pride and the Boast which his
Arrogance
Lifted in song,” _ - , ,
“What did he sing?” queried Jahveh, half-
smiling
Down on his henchman ;
“This, O Omnipotent, this was his song,
Just as I caught it at even: —
‘lt matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the
scroll,
I am the Master of my Fate, ■
I am the Captain of my Soul.’ ”
And, as great Michael intoned it there rang
Over, before him, and after,
Peals of an Infinite Laughter!
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 8, 1914.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
The war fever is in the air. Staid citi-
zens have been hanging the Jack and the
Australian flag to their motor-cars and out
of their house-windows and to their large
ears, and spending much valuable time
being a nuisance on the subject of militaiy
strategy. I know nothing the average man
(bv the way, is there an average man !)
can be so deadly dull about, especially when
he has read an eighteen-penny Life ot
Napoleon” or was at the Boer scramble with
the elephant transport, or whatever it was
they used to carry the pianos and bottled
beer.
The Mayor waved his rabbit-skins in the
breeze one day during the week while he
patriotically harangued the multitude. Also,
he opened a list of volunteers, and a thou-
sand-odd names have already been handed
in by their owners or by despairing friends
or people who owe money to them.
Mrs. Davies and her pretty daughterdn-
law, Mrs. Maldwyn Davies, were At Home
on Thursday afternoon to numerous visitors.
Pianist Gladys Frost lent a touch of melody
to the proceedings, and both hostesses were,
as always, harmoniously gowned.
The races to-day brought forth many
preUy frocks, but precious few popular
winners. After about the fourth race many
of the women punters began to wear the
thoughtful expression that betokens the
pruning of household expenses. The
Arthur Morgans occupied the vice-regal pen,
and the squattocracy surged around the
lawn. -Mrs Jaek-Thomson (who was Elsie
Forsyth, of your city) and her sister, Mrs.
Yal Macdonald, were two of the best-
dressed women there. As is always the case
on a big day, some of the sporty frocks were
fierce. One dame wore a garment that
looked like an abbreviated or epitomised
cassock, eked out with an underskirt of
tartan silk. Another female bore with for-
titude if not with grace the legs and wings
of a whole poultry crate on her hat.
The Cherniavsky boys charged into this
outpost on Wednesday. The small and ex-
citable Gaul who was the advance guard or
flying column had been bounding round some
days before. Clad in a coat that was mostly
tail, with tricolor in buttonhole, green socks,
furry hat and a few etceteras, he visited the
Town Hall and promised to the war fund
every cent realised by the first concert. Con-
sequently, all the available youth and
beauty and intelligence, likewise the Mayor
and his Mayoress, . and some 200 of
our infant defenders, filled with a deter-
mination to be loyal, went to the scene of
operations and lent an attentive ear to the
Mendelssohn concertos and other items on
the roster. At the end of the, entertainment
the Mayor made another speech and the
Cherniavskys played the Marseillaise and
the Russian National Anthem and “God
Save.”
The Red Dandies opened business at
Cremorne to-night to. a full house. Sister
Irene Vere and her ragtime songs were the
double-six of the evening, and she and the
other ladies of the co. gathered in much
fancy vegetation and elaborate encore.
Several Brisbaneites are worried about
relatives who are either shut up in the Big
Smoke or else are stranded in Europe (or
what remains of it). Among the former are
the wife and daughter of sub-editor Lewis,
of the Telegraph, the A. R. Menzies and
their little daughter, journalist Roy Evans
and various other good Queenslanders.
Premieress Denham and her two daughters
were in Brussels last time news of their
whereabouts floated this way.
Yours affectionately.
AUSTRALIAN JANE.
“Traddles” : A magnificent tribute to the
intelligence of Bananaland’s police force
occurred at Mackay not long since at an
inquiry into the sudden death of a cane-
cutter. The John Hop who attended the
post-mortem ’phoned his boss that death
was due to uric-acid poisoning. That bril-
liant Sherlock Lecocq issued instructions
for the discovery of the person or persons
who sold the uric acid. And not a black
tracker or a bloodhound-dog was available
until after the war.
“Mary Nightingale”: On the strength of
“previous experience” I wrested from half
a dozen other applicants the position of pro-
bationer in a private hospital, which job
carries a salary of 10s. a week and a
promise of more some day. Started next
morning at 5.30 and finished at 9.30 that
night, without a solitary break —except of
fasts. The second day was like unto the
first, except that two hours off were allowed,
in order that I might be sufficiently refreshed
to be at the helm during the night watch'es.
This means sleeping in a dressing-gown,
with one eye open, and responding to the
various calls from bells and babies. What
about a wages board for nurses?
Bananaland has lost a veteran journalist
in William Mcllwraith, of Rockhampton.
For 32 years he edited the Rockhampton
Morning Bulletin, and during the Kid-
ston regime mp.de it the first paper in the
North. Mcllwraith began spoiling paper on
the Ayr (Scotland) Advertiser about 60
years ago, and gradually wrote his way to
the editorship of the Dumfries Courier. In
1880 he came to Rockhampton and con-
nected himself with the Morning Bulletin.
There his hobby was agriculture, and through
his paper he rendered great help to settlers.
Incidentally, he trained many a youthful
journalist in the way he should go, and the
Inky Way of Australia is strewn with
writers who got their first lessons from him.
The editor of this paper is one of therm
Mcllwraith was aged 80-odd years, and
possessed of exceptionally clear faculties,
when the climate harvested him.
The familiar and attractive Blue Anchor
shipping flag is to disappear from Australian
ports. The P. and O. Co., when, as a result
of the Waratah disaster, it purchased the
Blue Anchor fleet, maintained the old design
for a while, but now it has decided on uni-
formity of bunting and paint. Hence tin?
white-topped blue funnel with the emblazoned
anchor gives place to plain black, and the
blue anchor flag comes down to make way
for the botch of colors that marks the cheap
nigger line.
“Harrison O.”: Australian dramatists
require to be warned against the “reper-
tory” play, which they seem disposed to copy,
under the delusion that a commercial failure
must be an artistic success. Generally, such
pieces fail in both respects. Certainly the
managerial coffers will never be reached by
constructing plays on the repertory model.
The chances of this country possessing, say,
a Bernard Shaw are remote, but there is
no reason why it should not disgorge a
Pinero. A Shaw is born; Pineros and
Grundies can be made. But instead of striv-
ing to acquire the technique—artificial, but
eminently serviceable —of the latter school,
local writers are disposed to accept the easy,
untidy technical standards of repertory pro-
ductions. F’rinstance, Mary Wilkinson’s
“Whither?” just put on in Melbourne by
Gregan McMahon, is evidently the work of
one full of Shawian philosophy and devoid
of theatrical knowledge. It is merely a dull
attempt to imitate the inimitable. The
light over the box-office may not be an in-
spiring beacon, but by keeping an eye on it
the local playwright may steer clear of a lot
of rocks.

The Danger of
CATARRH
The danger of breathing
in germs is very real
and ever-present. The
peril is doubled if you
have Catarrh. The
moist, mucous - laden
surfaces most annoy-
ing in themselves —are
a most attractive breed-
ing place for the dan-
gerous, and often life-
destroying, germs of
Tonsilitis, Influenza and
Diphtheria, and, most
dreadful of all, CON-
SUMPTION !
(W
Air-Passages of the Nose and Throat.
' KAT-Aft-AH " Treatment helps Nature put
them in good working order, in which conai-
tion it is impossible for Catarrh to exist.
You have Catarrh ! YOU can tell that by the
uncomfortable stuffiness in the nose, the constant
sniff, sniff, caused by moist accumulations, the
difficulty of breathing, the constant necessity of
clearing the throat by ‘‘hawking,” and the frequent
use of the handkerchief to blow the nose. Or
you may suffer from frontal headaches, your
hearing be affected, have noises in the head,
sneeze frequently or awake with a heavy, tired
feeling. Do not live in danger of Catarrh
developing into something worse, such as Deaf-
ness, Asthma, Catarrh of the Stomach, or
Consumption.
Free to Sufferers.
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to try a sample bottle of
Kat-ar-ah 5 ’ Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic com-
pound of certain valuable medicaments, and is supremely bene-
ficial in its influence on the mucous membrane. It has a
distinctly soothing, healing and aero-sanative effect, sufficient
to disintegrate and dislodge the slimy mucous accumulations.
Kat-ar-ah ” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing
effects are simply marvellous. You can notice an improvement
immediately after beginning its use. It quickly takes up its
work of killing the disease germs, of minimising, and eventually
stopping, the discomforting mucous discharges in the nose and
throat—mucous that is finding its way into your stomach and
poisoning your system.
You are invited to send at once for a FREE TRIAL BOTTLE
of Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant and a copy of my new and wonder-
fully-interesting Booklet, telling how to get rid of this terrible
scourge. Write to-day. Give your name and address clearly,
state whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss, be sure to mention this paper
and enclose 3d. in stamps to help pay postage, etc.

TO-DAY, particular thought should be
given to one’s shoes. Definite purpose
and not caprice should rule their
choice, since Fashion recognises their dress
value and insists that they shall harmonise
with the rest of one’s attire. Thus, by
following the lead of Fashion, a very dis-
tinctive and pleasing note can be attained.
Bostocks are designed for wear with the
newest toilettes ; they are exclusive in style
and the cream of imported shoes.
Special shipments have recently arrived
at the leading stores, and ladies should call

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Will buckjumper Skuthorpe or anybody
who knows his whereabouts communicate with Mr.
Joseph Woolf, solicitor, Norwich Union Chambers,
Melbourne. . . .L.N.: “Pants and Shirts” not good
enough.... Pickhandle: What’s all the fury about?-
Stanley was talking of gold mines, and you don’t
get iron and steel''from gold mines, do you? It’s
time a Governor or somebody heaved a truck-load of
bricks at the gold-mining fetich. The world being
foolish and wanting gold (if it weren’t foolish it
wouldn’t waste time and lives over the almost-useless
rubbish), Australia certainly owes much to the
metal. But because it owes much to the metal it is
expected to hang on for 20 years to alleged mines
that don’t pay their way, and Governments are
cursed if they don’t subsidise the unprofitable dere-
licts. For giving a baby country a start gold mining
is right enough, but if a country isn’t ready to cut
out the foolish business in 50 years (or less nowa-
days), and get to agriculture and manufacture, it is
too slow to catch the ’bus. . . .N.D.Mc: Can’t find
the information.... T.T.: Not w r orth while now....
Mimosa: Might have done something with it if you
had sent the clipping. Can’t understand it the way
you have jumbled it....H.S.: The police inspector of
the West Coast of M.L., who reported that the un-
desirables had cleared from his district “to their
homes in Australia” was wrong. They had merely
gone to have another look at the moon they’ve got
at Auckland... .E.H.B.: Thanks... .Nor-West: Don’t
know about Ireland, but there is a line between
Hamburg and Bremen. .. .II.McD.: Unable to get
that record. .. .E.L.C.W.: You start by saying that
“cablegrammed emasculations of the report of the
South African Dominions Commission can’t keep it
dark that the Randlord is damned” and go on to
show that he has the game in his pocket. That’s
kind of puzzling. .. .N. II. Evans: Please send us
your assurance that “The Red Road” is your own
work... .T.N.: “Lament” very fair in spots; but
the theme is worn to rags. . . .W.E. (Broken Hill):
Can’t use it. .. .II.M.S.: Have seen something like it
before. There is no worse complaint... .P.O.L.:
One wayside verse:—
And the folk within they were pleasant
/tnd merry (as inn-folk be)
And they set a fine store of victuals
Down for the filling of me.
God bless them !... .F.L.P.: Yes, you stopt!... .Car-
los: No....The Carbine Scribe: The noble horse
has been dead too long. Why rush in where tor-
toises would be afraid to creep? R.K.: We grieve
to say it isn’t. .. .Will S.: If you must write, don’t
write like a coy old lady... .John A.: It’s the wrong
sort of stuff for us.... I.II.: You seem to be excited
about something, but your writing is so difficult
that we can’t make out what it is... .E.L.B. (Arma-
dale, V.) : And to think that so late as 1903 you
were a cooing babe. Oh, well, here’s your war-
poem ; —■
AUSTRALIA’S ' SAFETY.
Many a power is fighting to-day,
Many a power is trying to slay.
Many a man armed with a gun,
Many brave men the battle have won.
But if Australia the guns we hear
Every man should volunteer,
Every man for his country’s sake
Every man precautions take.
And in our minds we ought to sing
The good old song “God Save the King.”
And just for good old Britain’s sake
Stick and fight at our only stake.
And now to all our fleet so wee
They would never surrender on the sea,
And on the enemies’ ships we kill
Every man with a hearty will.
And now for the women children and wives
Every man tries to save their lives
And every woman can help as well
Ask a doctor if you can’t tell.
And now to the noblest of our fleet,
If men board our ships we have a treat
So let every man fight and join now
And many an enemy to us shall bow.
.... Bilbee: Sincere but almost commonplace....
Q.J.: Very tame little story. It might find a home
in a respectable weekly with cows in its backyard.
Augustus: Amongst other things it is dull.
That’s enough. .. .Z.Z.: Doesn’t hang together as well
as a roped Alnine party. .. .Jacq: “Men” is a pro-
mising thing, but it has too many rough edges. . . .
W.E.R.: No skill. .. .W.O’S.: Anyone can string the
names of plays together. It’s a poor, cheap device
only fit for a variety-show comedian Charles
A. W.: Dentist item more gory than humorous....
Basket-Dodger: You’re not!. . ..Beejatoo: No stamps
enclosed for return.... Gladys M. P.: You are
young and, doubtless, beautiful. But the central
idea of the story is as old and as ugly as the Devil.
. . . . Vineleaf: Third attempt beaten back. Retire
in disorder... .C.B.A. (Q.) : You aim is very bad
indeed. The thing is too bad to bother about.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Rob S.: Hard and humorless.... Giz: Gags futile,
drawings no value. .. .Pomeroy: Now, why did you
waste all that time?... .V.O’L: You’re a menace to
our immortal soul A.G.: Crude M.R.B.: A
series of pictures of Joe Cook grinding out bad verse
from a phonograph? No thanks! S.J.D.: One is
an old B. gag; and the other is judged by the com-
pany it keeps, and cast out accordingly C.P.L.:
Thanks ; but the joke is hitched on to a long train
of circumstances which the artist couldn’t suggest in
a picture. . . ,P.L. (Brisbane) : It’s a wooden fight
picture, and the man who is being smashed doesn’t
look at all disturbed or uneasy in his mind....
Lex J.: Cartoon is a re-hash of an old idea, and
the deserted infant is such a degraded type that he
deserves his fate. And why rush in with a cartoon
of Holman at this early stage of his career. Who is
Holman, and what’s he done? Gee Gee: Sorry
unable to use any of the suggestions... .Spall (S.A.) :
The subject is of no interest, and we expect the
drawing to haunt us. It is terrible Frederick
H.: You are interesting in a wild, artistic way, but
you could not be reproduced—not that we want to
reproduce you L.F.D.: The gag is too obvious and
the drawing is bad. By the way, what a godsend
pockets are to the unskilled draughtsman. The Crea-
tor would have won the prayers of a lot of bad
artists if he had given man fins William C. M.:
Cartoon idea of no value to us... .C.R.C.: When you
have learnt a little about drawing and discovered a
sense of humor you will have some chance of
making a little out of humorous art... .H.L.M.:
You went to a lot of trouble, but we are not buying
trouble to-day. Nothing - in the idea....P.Q. (V.):
Sketches unsuitable.

The Rider.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The tears were all within,
The smile was on his lip ;
He sped away at noon of day
With dog and horse and whip.
The tears were in her eyes,
She did not smile at all;
For on his track a shadow black
All suddenly did fall.
What hurt their parting made
It were a pain to tell;
For twice he turned to where she yearned,
And twice he waved farewell.
It happened long ago,
And weary years have crept,
And stalwart men have died since then,
And watching women wept.
He comes no more, no more,
To ease her aching eyes;
How should he come —the dead and dumb?
How should the dust arise?
But when the slanting rai-i
Is falling through the trees,
And all is grey at end of day—
What is it that she sees?
The distance shows a shape
That sets her veins aglow—
Through mist and rain he rides again,
The youth of long ago.
The gathering shadows gloom,
The wet leaves drip and drip;
He speeds away at end of day
With dog and horse and whip.
N.s.w. Rodekic Quinn.
In forming Maoriland’s citizen, defence
force it has been found possible to a con-
siderable extent to draft the different trades
and professions into the branches- of' the
service where they will be of most use.
Thus, if a man is a blacksmith he becomes
a farrier; if he is a telegraphist he goes
into the engineers ; and if he is in the rail-
way service he joins the Transport Depart-
ment. So the army gets men ready trained
for a lot of the work they will have to. do
in the fighting force. The Railway battalion,
drawn entirely from the service, is one of
the most enthusiastic in M.R., and even the
newly-imported general manager has donned
a khnki uniform and become Colonel Hiley.
Evidently he is one of the sensible’ sort who
believes in doing something to defend the
country that pays his salary of £3000 a
year.
“Armes’ ” Maxims of War :—
The will is the man.
Naught happens but the unforeseen.
Caution in strategy, celerity in tactics. (Moltke
put it: “First weigh, then wage.”)
The moral is to the physical as three to one.
The general who never made mistakes never, made
war.
Omelettes cannot be made without breaking eggs.
Napoleon: “The Austrians never knew the value of
time. While they trifled, I overthrew them.” Crom-
well at Dunbar, Napoleon at Austcrlitz, and Welling-
ton at Salamanca conquered by seizing a moment to
strike while the enemy extended his line in front.
He was cut in two like a wriggling centipede.
The defensive must always include the offensive.
First, the will. (When Grant was besieging Vicks-
burg a general demonstrated to Mrs. Grant, a thousand
miles away, that the place could not possibly be
taken. “Ah,” said she, “you don’t know the general.
He’s such an obstinate man.”)
“The Oldest Inhabitant” describes the
building of the old home: —
Darlinghurst Gaol, which is being rapidly dis-
mantled of its fittings, was commenced in the mid-
20’s of last century, when, the Geovge-street gaob
being unsafe, the site was chosen, as being in “an
airy locality.” The foundations were laid and. part
of the wall of a very extensive building was erected ;
then funds ran out and work was knocked off. Never-
theless some use was made of the enclosure, within
which certain prisoners belonging to a “mineral
party” were accommodated in huts on wheels. In
1835 the Legislative Council voted £10,000 towards
the completion. The stone for the portion, next
erected was obtained from a quarry at the intersec-
tion of Forbes and William streets, 'fhe work of
quarrying was carried on by an, ironed-gang, of
prisoners—the “mineral, party” before mentioned.
One of the original walls still stands, weather beaten
and blackened, on Darlinghurst-road. Each stone in
it bears the number or initials or other mark of the
prisoner who “tooled” it. Six years elapsed before
the “new prison,”, as Sydney called it, was ready
for occupation. The first prisoner entered at. the,
Head of a column of , one hundred and eighteen male
offenders, chained together, and. marched from tjie
smellful abode in Lower George-strpet. The leader
of the procession and . the first prisoner to enter was
a notorious scoundrel, Paddy Curran, who was’await-
ing trial for murder. He was hanged- at Berrima in
the October following. On the day after Mr. Curran’s
eiitry, 50 female prisoners were marched along, to
their new villa, amidst the jeers and cheers of, a
typical “Cabbage Tree Mob”, of the early ’40’s.
“Supernumerary-Inspector”-: That so many
houses are burgled while the owners are ab-
sent does not surprise me; the thing that
surprises me is that' there are so few. A
gang composed of a house-painter, or, plumber
or two and a couple of bakers’, butchers’ or
milkmen’s carters could with impunity strip
almost every second house in the suburbs.
A very cursory examination of a neighbor-
hood would serve them as a, guide. The
blinds closely drawn, the doormat taken in,
the milk jug put 'out, the absence' of smoke
from the chimneys, and a dozen other, signs
would tell them that everybody washout and
the house unprotected. Then, therp’s the
architecture. Columns, piers, mouldings,
eaves and sills are so arranged that a, moder-
ately-active cripple with the aid of a whar-
fie’s cargo-hook could climb all over seven
oh,t of ten,suburban villas. To a painter or
plumber the job is a cake-walk. To further
simplify matters, what may be called the
prudery of suburbia comes in to play. Houses
are built so that no neighbor’s window com-
mands a view of the place, and fences and
shrubs further serve to make a walled-in
Darlinghurst of the premises. But even if a
neighbor can get a view, scullery and kitchen
and bay and other windows are placed in
nooks and angles that would cover half a
dozen burglars while they cut a wall, let
alone a window. The subdivision fiend has
also so mazed the lanes and streets that, in
the event of a surprise, a regiment of bur-
glars, in two or, three turns and twists, could 1
lose themselves and escape the solitary police-
man on square-mile beat. i

Once Upon a Time
there was an alarm clock
who wanted to get up in
this world.
So he had himself fitted
with a regular watch es-
capement, a light-run-
ning motor, two selective
alarm calls, and large
easy-winding keys.
Then, so they could see
him in the dim morning
light, he ordered himself
a great big dial and bold
clean-cut hands.
When he was dead sure
he could make a clean
sweep he hung out his
shingle and bid for busi-
ness.
To-day there are three and a
half million names’on his calling
list—he’s got the biggest practice
in the alarm clock business.

“Port Watch,” London: Recent false
alarms in connection with the “5.0.5.” call
helped to bring about a curious mix-up in
the re-insurances on the Empress of Ireland.
Some of the gamblers in marine, insurance
had been badly bitten over the Siberia scare
and one or two others, so when the first
news of the Empress trouble came through
there was a reluctance to whirl in on any
re-insurance gamble. Then, when someone
looked up the whereabouts of the Empress
and found she could not possibly be out of
the St. Lawrence, another cable came along
saying that the boat had butted into an ice-
berg and was a total loss. As icebergs
don’t pervade the river, the wise ones jumped
to the conclusion that the whole thing was
another Siberia hoax badly stage-managed,
and they heaped money on the gamble at
the rate of two guineas per cent. Another
cable lobbed in saying the first one was a
liar and that the boat had been in collision
and had sunk in 10 minutes. This made it
a bit more possible; still Lloyd’s—the gamb-
ling exchange—hesitated to accept the yarn,
and some more business was done at 10
per cent. Then cables began to roll in hot
and fast, the rate rose to 45 guineas, at
which heavy re-insurances were effected
until definite and official news came of the
total loss. As no less than four wirelessed
false alarms have hit Lloyd’s in the past
couple of months, and as sinister rumors
are afloat that shady work is responsible
for them, Lloyd’s are beginning to say things
about wireless.

“Moana”: Let me speak seriously to
“Iliki” (B. 9/7/T4) about the inaccuracy
of his par. apropos the M.L. Farmers’ Co-op.
Ass’n. First of all, let me ask him when this
Ass’n paid a 15 per cent, dividend, as he
wildly asserts, and when it watered its stock.
as he further avouches. The biggest divi-
dend this concern has ever paid is 9 per
cent, (on its ordinary capital), and there
is an awful gidf between that figure and 15
per cent. Usually, the dividend on the ordi-
nary shares hangs round about 74 per cent.,
and the preference shares only call for 6 per
cent. Further, the Ass’n has never watered
its stock. If he feels that way “Iliki” is at
liberty to wager that I am wrong.
* * * *
“Cazeeka” : Tradesmen who have adopted
the practice of placing on their billheads an
intimation that so much interest will be
charged on overdue accounts were ruled out
of order by a Maoriland magistrate the other
day. A plaintiff had included in his claim
an item for interest; but the S.M. informed
him that the amount could not be charged
unless he produced a written agreement with
liis customer to that effect. When plaintiff
had recovered from the shock he gasped
out: “But we’ve got it on all our billheads !”
The S.M. shattered another illusion. “Np
good,” said he. “This is a tradesmen’s
account for goods supplied, not for money
lent.”
“Hamer”: A Bathurst case shows how
necessary it is to put the time-payment
person in the same position as the money-
lender so far as usurious interest is con-
cerned. The case was one of larceny, and
the evidence of the prosecutor, who sold
jewellery, was that, while ordinarily he
would charge £4 for a ring which cost him
80s. —a massive profit which the trade
explains by pointing out that the jeweller
has to hold a large capital in goods which
move off slowly—on time payment he would
sell the ring for £l2. He declared that even
then there was not much in the business,
and probably there is not. Fools who would
make such a bargain must be rare. But
fools need protection, and it is not only fools
who make bad bargains with the T.P. man.
The trader who breathes the insidious “Why
Pay Cash?” inquiry into the ear of the per-
son who usually hasn’t the cash to pay, has
many cunning little tricks; and while there
are reputable t.p. merchants, there are others
who are in the business mainly for the
illicit profits that come out of it. This
writer was informed (rather proudly) by
an employee of one of them, as a load of
furniture was being brought into the shop,
that the same lot had been sold five times,
that on each occasion its actual cost had
been more than paid, and that the goods
were still the property of the firm. The law
has endeavored to restrain the rapacity of
the money-lender; and there is no difference
between the two, except that one advances
goods and the other money. Usually they
could even swap names and noses without
anybody noticing the transaction.
A RUINED INDUSTRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Head-hunting was the football and the cricket of
the, Solomon Islanders before the arrival of the mis-
sioners. In abolishing head-hunting the missionaries
created a problem which has not yet been satisfac-
torily solved. The natives, deprived at a blow
of their inspiration and their chief occupation, find
the time hang heavily on their hands. They have
become lazy and dispirited. —Bishop of Melanesia.
Of old the busy cannibal
Improved each shining hour
In cutting off his neighbor’s head,
And leaving him extremely dead ;
Until the gracious power
Exerted by the Christian mind
Beformed each heathen, basely blind.
When clubs were trumps, and simple faith
Than native blood was less,
The islands were a happy hive
Of industry; to keep alive
Meant shunning idleness.
But now, his occupation gone,
In sloth the savage lingers on.
He once existed by the sweat
Of his dear brother’s brow ;
But Christian teaching spread its rays,
Arid on the scalps of other days
lie gazes sadly now;
Mourning, with hunger in his eyes,
The death of Private Enterprise.

The Perplexing Case of Mr.
Homer, Pastoralist and Poet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our modern world misses the fact which was
patent to the Greek mind that art and utility must
50 hand in hand.— English paper,
A SALT girl sitting on the sea,
With round and dimpled sunburnt
arms,
Made laughter, calling Heaven and me
To witness her abundant charms ;
A soft cloud-maiden, dimly drest,
Reclined on pillows of the sky
As, surging flame, the kindly west
<irappled the hot sun to her breast,
And hooded eve drew nigh.
These things occurred in youngest Greece.
Slow from my mountain couch I rose.
The wild thyme held my body's crease,
And every greener thing that grows
A fragrance through the warm air spent
That on my. sated nostrils smote,
As though some god had sprinkled scent
As down the evening world lie went
Without his overcoat.
My sheep were sitting all around,
Calm sheep, with wondrous bushy tails-
Each wether there was worth a pound
Down at the Phrygian weekly sales.
Prime mutton for the export trade,
[ topped the market, every draft.
'Twas by the stirring songs I made
Such fat upon their ribs was laid —
The plump flock knew my craft.
Bright lyrics full of passion’s thrill
Improve the staple of the fleece,
Dramatic fragments sung Avith skill
Cause lambs to gain ten pounds apiece;
But give me still the epic strain,
The long and loud heroic flight
Of Helen loved, or Hector slain,
Ulysses’ guile, or Priam’s pain
To keep my mutton right.
Cowmen had statues; we had song;
The lowing herd rejoiced to see
The clear white marble, fair and strong,
Wrought with a subtle artistry.
A perfect Pliryne’s sculptored breast
Could much increase the butter yield,
Each lady of the dairy field
Viewed it and did her best.
The ages pass, and men forget
What useful things our hands once
wrought;
They know the morns were dewy wet,
They know to what a pitch we brought
The large achievements of our art.
I sang. They know the songs I made.
The ancient echoes round them start,
All men admit that I was smart,
My glory cannot fade.
Large kings have listened, drunk with wine,
And added hugely to my fame,
Applauding those old songs of mine,
And praising Mr. Homer’s name.
But they forgot, like all the rest.
While waving beer-mugs to the sky,
That, north and south and east and west,
The Homer mutton was the best
A Phrygian pan could fry.
Day called to day. the earth went round.
Tall gods came floating down the world !
My work remains. I made a sound
Before the years were oiled and curled.
I made a sound—in fact a row.
But where is now the flock I fed?
My peasant sheep with bushy tails.
That topped the Phrygian weekly sales,
Are absolutely dead.
A salt girl sitting on the sea,
With round and dimpled sunburnt arms,
Made laughter, calling Heaven and me
To witness her abundant charms.
I saw the damsel where she sat,
The evening wave was soft and cool —
Oh, happy wethers, rolling fat!
Well might I jump upon my hat
And call myself a fool!
The high utility of song
I never doubted, come what might;
But all my theories go wrong
When I remember that soft night.
The moon made light across the deep,
And silvered all the rippling tide,
And I who sang the years to sleep,
To get good prices for my sheep,
Was singing to a bride.
Mutton and bride have passed away,
The simple world I knew is dust,
The moons and suns are still at play,
New poets sing to earn a crust.
My world is dead, my work remains,
Dream whispers tell me this and that—
Oh, windy Troy’s immortal plains !
I dream. . . .1 wait. . . .but none explains
Why Homer kicked his hat.
N.S.W.
MARY McCOMMONWEALTH.
John Weathercock, Grocer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BOSS in, Joe?” inquired the tall,
saturnine man who had just stepped
off the tram.
The young assistant grocer hung up the
last cluster of brushware on the doorpost of
the shop, and turned round. “Yers, he’s in-
side tryin’ ter make up ’is mind about that
there sugai offer of yours. Been worryin’
about it ever since you tackled ’im larst
Thursday.”
The tall man wearily pushed his dusty
boxer hat far back on his head. “What’s
he worryin ’ about? Oughter.be easy enough
bn a man ter make up 'is mind about a thing
like that
The hitched impatiently at his
■apron. ”It on y liter be, o’ corse! But you
1 now th’ sorter man V is! Always backin’
an’ fillin’, an’ arskin’ advice, an’ never talcin'
it— ’nuf ter give yer the Timp!” He spat
with precision on the freshly-swept path and
jerked his thumb at the dark entrance. “If
.'.rr arsk my opinion. I don’t think ’e ’as a.
mind ter make up at all !” With that he
'n-ned and folded up his steps, and the
saturnine, traveller strode in the sawdusted
entrance, and observed the nervous pro-
prietor e.' eing him apprehensively round the
c rner o', a rampart of biscuit, tins. ““Tllo.
\N eathercock !’’ he Bailed.
\\ eathercock, a meek-lookiug, red-nosed
man with a ragged, irresolute mouslachc
that explored the atmosphere in all direc-
tions, came forth reluctantly and stood mis-
erably at bay behind the dinted counter.
“Nice mornin’,” he mumbled.
“Grand !” sighed the traveller, and, with-
out further preliminaries, fell upon his timid
prey. “Thought eny more about That?” he
demanded truculently.
Weathercock sucked a hollow tooth, thrust
his hands deep into his trouser pockets and
squinted sideways at the street, by way of
avoiding the traveller’s baleful gaze,
I’ve been turnin’ it over in Me Mind.”
“Well, Wot About It?”
Weathercock sucked twice. “We-11,” with
an air of intense solemnity, “I carn’t come
ter no decision !”
“W’y ? Didn’t I make it plain to yer?
Ain’t yer satisfied yet that yer gotter charnce
o’ makin’ somethin’ on yer shooger, ’stead
o’ handlin’ it fer nothin’? Wot is there
about it yer carn’t understand?”
“Oh, I unnerstand it orright!"
The traveller clicked impatiently. “Well,
w’v carn’t yer come to a decision?”
The grocer withdrew his right hand from
his trouser pocket, and, catching up one of
the brass scale weights, balanced it care-
fully. “This ’ere’s th’ sorter thing that re-
quires Thinkin’ Over. I don’t wanter make
no mistakes, yer know. ‘More ’urry less
speed,’ as th’ sayin’ is.” He seemed to get
an immense amount of satisfaction out of
this speech ; but the persistent traveller was
rendered so wild by it that he was quite
incapable of speech, and had to wrench
open a biscuit tin in search of something to
bite.
The proprietor of the shop, weight in
hand, studiously avoided his eye, as he leaned
against the counter savagely munching a
coffee biscuit. “I don’t wanter make No
Mistakes,” he repeated dully, when the
silence had become unbearable.
“You don’t make many mistakes!” jeered
the chewing traveller.
“Becos I Thinks Things Over!” droned
the grocer triumphantly.
For a little while the pair of them watched
with gloomy abstraction the busy scuffling
and dragging of the scornful young assistant
getting the shop ready for the day’s work.
It was his dreary fate to have to listen to
many such pointless discussions. He was
thoroughly sick of them, and had an enor-
mous contempt for his vacillating employer.
But he didn’t mind so long as he escaped
being drawn into the argument and asked
for his advice. Long experience had shown
him that his professional opinion, so eagerly
sought, was invariably disregarded. The
unsuspicious Weathercock always accounted
for .Toe’s reluctance to contribute a few re-
marks by saying that he “was a quiet sorter
lad—no buttin’'in, or anythin’ of that sort
about ’im.”
“You’ve ’ad two weeks now !” barked the
traveller suddenly.
The young girl who had sidled in during
the thoughtful interval for half a pound of
butter glanced nervously over her shoulder,
and turned back to the butter and cheese
counter, towards which the assistant was
now scuffling. He secretly resented the
Boss’s interminable interviews with travel-
lers while he was “squaring up” and cus-
tomers were waiting. As he often remarked
to confidants, “A man carn’t do two things
at once. Blimey, the only time the old cow
works is w’en I’m out with th’ cart.”
“It’s no good doin’ things in too much of
a ’urry!” intoned the grocer.
The traveller yawned cavernously,
stretched, and tipped the dusty boxer hat
over his eyes. “W’en’ll I call again?” he
demanded in a savagely hopeless way.
“Oh, nex’ time yer parsin’.”
“This day week?”
The relieved grocer put down the weight.
“Yers, that’ll do!”
The traveller was turning away disgustedly
when something rustled crisply in his pocket.
Before the grocer knew what he was about
he was back at the counter, had a book of
lottery tickets open, was scribbling the name
“J. Weathercock” across the butts of two,
and was light-heartedly demanding two shil-
lings for the semi-detached slips.
“I —I don’t bleeve in them things,” pro-
tested Weathercock weakly. “Never won
anvthin’ in me life!”
“’Ave another shot.” chirped the vendor.
“It’s for the ospittle any’ow—good cause,
an’ all that sorter thing. Give’s two bob.”
“One’s enuf fer me !”
“Two charnces is better than one!”
“W’y carn’t yer take th’ second yer self?
I ain’t" got so much munney ter spend !”
The traveller held out the tickets and
shook them. “I got ’arf a dozen meself
already. ’Ere yer are—Four-oh-eight-seven
an’ Four-oh-eight-eight—two bobs’ worth !”
Weathercock reluctantly dredged the sil-
ver from his pocket and handed it over, rue-
■ fully accepting the tickets in return. “Never
won anythin’ in me life!” he mumbled sulk-
ily.
“It’s for the orspittle any’ow. Ooo’-day.
ole man!” The raider went out hastily,
chuckling at his charitable brigandage, and
found outside the assistant, helping to load
tlie delivery cart. “Struck th’ Boss fer two
bobs’ worth o’ raffle tickets,” he reported in
a joyous undertone.
Joe swung a loaded case into the cart with
a crash and grunted, “Good enuf for tlr
cow!”
The traveller laughed and heavily pursued
a passing tram.
Woathfrcock could have sworn that he
had only enjoyed two days’ respite from the
traveller’s solicitations when he found him-
self once more facing his eager enemy, across
the battered counter. As before., it was
morning, and .Toe was busily shoving cases
about, and hanging things up in preparation
for the day’s trading.
“Thought any more about That?” de-
manded the traveller —exactly as before.
Weathercock sucked desperately at his
hollow tooth, groped for the brass weight,
and, failing to find it. wedged himself be-
tween the shelves and the counter. “Yers, I
been turnin’ it over in Me Mind!”
That started them off fairly. Slowly and
painfully they traversed the old, well-
trampled ground, till Weathercock made
what he considered to be one of his heaviest
scores with “ ‘More 'urry less speed,’ as th’
savin’ is.”
At this point the wearied traveller intro-
duced a bright and original touch by growl-
(Continued on next page.)


FOR
The inr mediate and continuous success of the unique Peps treatment for
coughs, colds, sore throat, bronchitis, and other throat and chest ailments
is due to the fact that Peps provide, in handy tablet form, a potent
medicine which is breathed direct into the
bronchial tubes and lungs. The dotted lines in
this diagram follow the direction of the air we
breathe, whether through the nostrils (r) or the
mouth (2). Passing over the tongue (3) the
air mingles, with the fumes emitted from
the little Peps tablet dissolving on the tongue,
and both are carried through the opening (4) to the throat.
Note that the Peps fumes pass down a separate passage (5) direct
to the lungs, not down the gullet (6) to the stomach, which is the
way all liquid medicines must go. To swallow any medicine into the
lungs is utterly impossible; and no medicine taken into the stomach
can reach the lungs.
Free from all
drowsy drugs,
always pure
and constant in
comp osition,
Peps are of
incalculable
value as a sooth-
ing, healing, re-
storing, and
germ - destroy-
ing remedy for
the throat and
chest troubles
so prevalent at
this season.

A Remarkable Remedy.
Few medicines have met with more favor or accomplished more good thaii
Chamberlain s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy.
It has relieved more pain and suffering’ and saved the lives of moreneoole
than any other preparation in use. One or two doses of it is enough to relieve
an ordinary attack of colic or diarrhoea. It has been used in many epidemics of
dysentery with perfect success.
It relieves bowel complaints in their most severe forms and is especially valu-
able for diarrhoea and summer complaint in children. J

WHY BEST FOR BABIES.
, “ I am often asked why Chamberlain 's Cough Remedy
is best for babies. Well, there are several reasons :
First: It is perfectly harmless and can begiven with every confidence to
the youngest or most delicate child.
Secondly : It contains no alcohol, opium, chloroform, morphine or any
other narcotic, and you not only have the manufacturers’ assurance of
this, but the wrapper around each bottle bears the Government analysis
showing that it has been officially declared free from all narcotics.
Thirdly : Children like it and no persuasion is needed to get them to
take it.
For the above reasons alone it is impossible to get a better medicine
for babies than

COUGH
EEMEEV
But aside from its safety it cures coughs and colds, is the best remedy
known for croup, and when given as soon as the croupy cough appears
it will even prevent the attack.’ *

ing, “Gorblessmesoul, you never ’urried in
yer life !”
The shocked grocer, vaguely conscious
that the rules of debate had been broken
somewhere, stiffened in his entrenchments,
“If—if yer mean that I never do anythin’
rush” —he began, with great dignity.
But the wild traveller shoved his dusty
boxer to the back of his head. “No!” he
shouted, “I don’ mean that at orl! What I
mean is that you keep a man messin’ about
an’ wastin’ ’is time while you make up yer
mind ! W’y earn’t yer give a man a plain
‘Yes’ or ‘No’ an’ be done with tlr d —d
thing?”
Joe hurriedly found himself a noiseless
and unobtrusive job at the cashier’s desk,
where he could listen in comfort.
Weathercock, very ruffled and alarmed,
half-heartedly tweaked at his wandering
moustache. “There ain’t no ’casion ter torlc
like that, Mister ’Arris ! I—l carn’t make
up me mind orf ’and erbout these !”
“Gorblessmesoul, ’ go’s arshin 9 yer ter
make up yer mind orf ’and? W’y, it’s d —n
near a month since I put ther p’rsition before
yer !”
“Well,” desperately, “I ain’t come ter no
decision yet!"
“’Ere! tell me this! ’Ave yer reely
thought it over at all?”
“Yes, o’ corse I ’ave! ’Aven’t I tole yer
I been turnin’ it over in. Me Mind?”
“An’ you ain’t come ter no decision Yet?”
“Ain’t I jus’ tolc yer so?”
The traveller looked him in the eye and
saw there nothing but hopeless indecision.
“Wot are yer reasons?” he implored. “Tell
us w’y yer carn’t make up yer mind ? Give
us somethin’ ter go on, f’r Gossake !”
Weathercock looked away. He was prob-
ably very near tears. “I—l carn’t make up
Me Mind!” he repeated, dull as a cow.
The traveller took a coffee biscuit and slid
his boxer over his eyes till he bore a strong
resemblance to a masked burglar. Pointing the
coffee biscuit straight at his victim, revolver
fashion, he said, coolly and offensively,
“D’ye know what T think? I think yer ain’t
got no mind ter make up! So long!” He
retired swiftly, biting at the coffee biscuit.
Y\ hen the breathless Weathercock recov-
ered, lie observed Joe burrowing earnestly
in a bin. “ ’E’s a cheeky bloke, that ’Arris!”
he called. “Did you ’ear ’im jus’ now?”
Joe emerged from the depths, bright-eyed
and dusty. “No; what was he sayin’?”
"Weathercock captured a shred of mous-
tache with his underlip and chewed angrily.
“Oh —nothin’ much!”
Joe wheeled round and smothered his in-
decent and disloyal mirth in the shelter of
the bin.
Harris reappeared a fortnight or so later
and informed a very severe and distant
Weathercock that the grocers who were sup-
porting the new arrangement were making
handsome profits. “Sorry I carn’t offer yer
th’ special discounts, Weathercock. Yer see,
we ’('ld the offer open for yer ’slong’s we
could. Still, we kin let yer in with th’ crowd
any time yer like.”
“I’m satisfied as I am,” retorted the
grocer primly.
The tall traveller smiled down condescend-
ingly. “Glad to ’ear it, ol’ man. Makin’
orl th’ munney yer want now, ain’t yer?”
“I’m makin’ enuf, any’ow!”
“Well, enuf’s as good" as a feast, ain’t it?
Ta-ta, ol’ cock.” Joe winked at him as he
dived out of the door.
Harris had some business visits to make in
the vicinity, so it was a good two hours
before lie was ready to get back to the city
with his collected orders. As he stood wait-
ing for his tram in a shady doorway, he
caught sight of a man hovering undecidedly
on the opposite corner. A second glance
showed him that it was Weathercock. Evi-
dently he had two calls to pay in different
directions, for lie kept making nervous little
runs, baulking, and returning. It was a
shameful and painful exhibition, and Harris
at last strode across and gave the irresolute
one a violent shove from behind. “Go that
way, d —n yer!” he hissed, as the astonished
grocer recovered from his stumble and looked
round.
“That — that’s a nice thing ter do!” he
coughed.
Harris, the tyrant, flourished a scornful
arm at him. “Serve yer right! W’y don’t
yer make un yer mind ter go one way, an’
stick to it?”
“You —you got no right ter do that,
Arris!”
“Well,” defiantly, “yer shouldn't mess
erbout! S’o-long!”
He swung himself on board an opportune
tram, and swept away, leaving Weathercock
still wavering miserably on the sunlit
corner.
Thereafter Harris never passed Weather-
cock’s place without dropping in to stir up
the helpless owner, who. now that his chance
had missed from him, worried Joe to swear-
ing pitch with voluntary explanations of why
he had let it escape him. These explana-
tory spasms occurred almost hourly, and
generally at the most inconvenient times.
He would indulge in gloomy reverie, and
call ins busy assistant from all sorts of jobs
merely to make some such speech as : “ You
know ’ow it is! A man comes to yer an’ sez,
‘Will yer do So-an’-So or /S'o-an’-So?’ ’Ow
am I ter know ’ow it’s goin’ ter turn out?
I want time ter make up Me Mind! I
carn’t be expected ter make up Me Mind
orf’and, can I? Well, that’s ’ow it was with
that, dashed ’Arris! Now ’ere I am still
makin’ nothing on me shooger, jus’ becos ’e
wouldn’t gimme time ter make uii Me Mind!”
Joe found hi in self, at all hours of the day,
listening helplessly to variations of the same
Passionate harangue, delivered with more or
less appropriate gestures. At last he begged
Harris to have mercy on his unfortunate
employer. “ ’Ey. ’Arris, give th’ old pot a
rest, f’r Gossake! ’E’s near drivin’ me
barmy to:kin’ about shooger!”
Harris tilted the dusty boxer and laughed
mischievously. “Not me! I got ’im fairly
goin’ now!” '
“Yors,” growled Joe. “you got ’im goin',
an’ ’e’s got me goin’! Why th’ blazes didn’t
yer make up ’is mind for ’im w’ile you was
at it?”
“Thought yer said ’e ’adn't gutter mind?”
Joe laughed shortly and turned away.
“No more ’e ain't!”
It was a hao autumn morning, some weeks
later. . -the traveller opened his morning
paper _in the rattling tram and discovered
smue interesting headlines. After the first
glance he crumpled the paper anyhow and
road hungrily the paragraph they were dc-
signed to draw attention to. When he had
read it through twice, he rolled the paper into
a ball and heaved it disgustedly out the
door. -Then he groped for his pipe and filled
it moodily with rank tobacco from his ragged
old pouch. “An’ I made ’im take th’ second
ticket against ’is will! Oh, li — l!"
Arrived in town, he captured another
tram and went straight out to see the man
who had won £(100 with the lottery ticket
lie had practically forced upon him.
He found Weathercock lurking, as usual,
behind the biscuit tins. He emerged smirk-
mg miserably. “’Ullo, ’Arris. Seen th’
paper?”
“Yers, that’s wot’s brought me out so
early. Well,” with a deep sigh. “I'm glad
yer won—though I wish ter Gord I’d kept th’
ticket meself!”
Weathercock seemed undecided as to how
to take it.
beipose you 11 be goin’ fer a trip or
somethin’ like that, eh?”
“P’raps,” murmured the grocer, drearily.
Or improvin’ th’ shop? Yer could make
tins a nice place with six ’undrcd o’ tli’ best.”
Oh—/ dunno !”
„ “Maybe,” continued Harris feverishly,
maybe you’d rather move inter tli’ noo
buildin’s?”
"P’raps,” sighed the grocer.
Harris! vaguely irritated, shoved back the
dusty boxer. ’Don’t yer know what yer
goin’ ter do with it yet? Gorblessmesoul! if
I won—v—!”
Weathercock averted his eyes and rubbed
the dinted counter nervously with the ex-
tieme edge of his apron. “I—l’m turnin’
it over in me mind ! I—well, it’s come so
sudden that, ter tell yer th’ troolh, I don't
know whether ter larf or ter cry!"
Harris was discovered later talking fiereelv
to himself in a tram He had to be asked
twice for Ins fare, and, as he handed it over,
lie told the collector., quite unnecessarilv,
that some people were mad.”
KODAK.
A Game of Chance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
George had an eye for the girls.
He watched them pass in review
order—then made his choice.
Gwynne, in tailor-made and two furred
skins as white as her own, was loaded with
£5 worth of drapery parcels. She hadn’t
enough hands.
George always made a point of embracing
opportunities—and girls.
“May I assist?”
“Certainly—take these.”
“Did you find them”
“No; I bought them.”
“I was about to say, did you find them
heavy?”
“It was not so much the avoirdupois as
the cubic contents.”
“May I call”
“You are very forward —you may not!”
“What I intended to ask was that I might
call a cab.”
“We can walk —it’s only a block or two.”
“I love”
“Not so fast, please!”
“I love- —that is to say, I like walking.”
“I do it for exercise. Father wants me
always to take the car.”
“I often do —the tram-car.”
“Your humor is presumptuous.”
“Sorry, I’m sure ! I try”
“I must ask you to stop trying.”
“I always try to be obliging. I’m not
used to cultivated ways.”
Gwynne turned away her head slightly
bored.
“I’ve made a mistake,” Harry admitted.
‘Excuse me!”
“If my Toorak friends heard of this inci-
dent, they’d cut me.”
“How keen their friendship must be!”
“In our circles —the circles of the rich—
friends are reckoned on a financial basis.”
“My sort would be worth twopence the
large bunch !”
“More vulgarity.”
“One’s nature can’t”
“Thank goodness, here we are.”
“Oh !”
“I hope father doesn’t see me.”
Harry gave a start as he saw the house.
Then he looked closely at the girl.
The pair walked up the long, grass-edged
track, Harry a little behind, like a whipped
poodle. He was loaded with parcels.
The footman answered the door. At first
lie seemed astonished, and glanced at Harry
—then half-smiled. A sort of inflated aspect
came over him. He took the parcels from
his arms. Gwynne opened her purse. She
passed Harry a shilling.
“Here’s your reward! James, take this
young man round to the kitchen and give
him a glass of beer and a”
“I can’t wait.” Harry stuttered, but he
took the coin and ran. Jeames reeled in his
tracks.
At the gate Harry looked back. No one
was in sight. He whistled to himself; then
called a passing hansom, murmuring lan-
guidly to the driver, “Menzies I”
He lit a half-crown cigar, and paid the
oriver liberally.
live minutes later the very last thing in
motor-cars sw-ept noiselessly up to the door.
A fashion-plate stepped out.
“Has Mr. Ainge called, James?”
“Yes, Miss! He” — Jeames almost choked
with suppressed emotion.
“I thought I saw him in a hansom we Rist
passed.”
“Yes. Miss. He would not stay. He
helped”— James nearly swallowed 'himself
hereabouts.
“That wall do.”
“Yes, Miss!” Jeames straightened up
with an immense effort.
"Is Gwynne home? I sent her on ahead
with the parcels.”
“Yes, Miss!” Jeames tottered on his
calves.
“Gwynne !”
“Yes, Miss !”
“Get my newest frock out, Gwynne.”
“<Certainly, Miss !”
“I intend dining at Menzies with Dad and
an old friend.”
“Very good. Miss !”
Jeames stumbled down into the kitchen
and. metaphorically speaking, burst.
