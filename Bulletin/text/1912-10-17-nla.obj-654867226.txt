The Fool in Christ
The Red Page
Like Sudermann, the other famous Ger-
man dramatist, Gerhart Hauptmann, is
turning from the stage to the novel. The
Fool in Christ (B. W. Huebsch, New
York) is the story of a simple peasant who
attempted to live in modern Germany a
life modelled on that of Christ. Hauptmann
has here, in a thoughtful novel, attempted
to answer the question, “If Christ came to
Germany?” The result is a book that re-
views the Biblical story in the light of twen-
tieth century thought, ana furnishes a credi-
ble picture of the environment that formed
the indispensable background to the ministry
of Jesus.
Emanuai Quint is presented to us as a
fool, a harmless and lovable fool, who, at
first conscious only of his pious desire to
follow in the footsteps of Christ, is led at
last to proclaim himself Christ. He makes
his appearance among a peasantry sunk in
superstition, deeply concerned with its soul,
and familiar, as few of the present Aus-
tralasian generation are familiar, with the
words of the Bible. This folk-soul of the
German peasant takes its religion seriously,
almost fanatically; it is unconsciously eager
to be deceived, it awaits with confidence the
second appearance of Christ on earth, and
is waiting at the early door to get
front seats for the millennium. In this
soil the conception of the divinity of
Quint finds congenial sustenance, and the
legend of his Christship springs up and
blossoms with remarkable vigor. These
peasants have a healthy belief in a personal
Satan, and in the bloke who is termed
Anti-Christ; and they believe that people
can be “possessed of the devil.” So the com-
ing of Emanuai Quint as Christ on earth is
accepted by them with avid belief. Only
the cultured class, into contact with which
his fame soon brings him, shows the scep-
ticism of modern thought.
£
His career began with a sermon that he
preached in a village market place. He is
the son of a peasant woman who had a
liason —it is hinted with a Catholic priest.
Her husband was a village carpenter. This
idle carpenter’s apprentice had nurtured his
soul on the Bible. At first, he had no thought
of being anything but the least of Christ’s
followers: —
He was ready to lose himself in the
Saviour.. But bis love made stronger claims
upon him and enticed him farther and far-
ther. It was not enough for his love calmly
to endure the results of a passive imitation
of Christ. It would follow the Shepherd
along all the labyrinthine paths He had
gone. Not one of the things He had suf-
fered would Quint omit. He would be like
Him in all respects, and so nearer to Him.
He would act Christ teachings, not
teach them... .Therefore it was not as an
especial teacher, or disciple, or prophet that
he wanted to go down among men. He
wanted to do good in secret rather than
openly.... He would serve all and command
none." That was the Fool’s prodigious,
wholly impracticable resolve.
But this was impossible. Already legends
of miracles wrought by this new teacher
had spread through the credulous district,
and in the spreading they were not mini-
mised.
He found himself besieged by throngs
of the infirm and the disabled. “The world
has often the experience that a false belief
will spread over wide areas like a conflagra-
tion, or a blight, or an epidemic.” But
Quint Tefused to work miracles; though, as
there was something in the man’s person-
ality that attracted every person with whom
he came into contact, faith worked the
miracles that he shrank from. The news-
papers chronicled the news off his doings, to
the embitterment of Emanual’s humble soul.
His first sermon had been taken notice of
by the authorities, but for wise reasons they
decided not to make too much of the inci-
dent, and had dismissed him with kindly
warnings. Later, however, his doings attract
so much attention that the police are com-
pelled to interfere. He is arrested and ex-
amined by alienists in the vain attempt to
prove him insane. At this stage a philan-
thropic lady takes him up and allows him
the seclusion of her large estate. But
already he has found credulous adherents,
who persist in regarding themselves as the
disciples of his divinity. At various stages
of his career he is examined by medical men,
and he is variously termed hydro-cephalic
and tubercular, a paranoiac and a cretin.
“What,” Quint asks, “is the most precious,
the teaching of our Lord, as written down
by human hands? The earthly life of our
Lord ? Or the heavenly life of our Lord ?
I believe that in the heavenly life the
drossless light of the spirit shone. In
Christ’s second life on earth, dross already
obscured that holy light of the spirit. So
how much more dross must there not be in
the third life, in the printed pages of a book,
which reproduces something related by men,
heard by men, written down by men. Or
are there persons who think that the glory
enveloping the Son of God originates in this
book? No, it merely contains a faint reflec-
tion of His glory.”
So his humble following in the way of
Christ leads him to criticism. He refuses
to attend a church.
J*
But already his disciples were giving
trouble. They met at a secluded mill, and
called themselves “The Brethern of the
Valley.” The brethern included sisters —
and from their brooding over their alleged
revelations they passed to orgies of religion,
ending in scenes of passionate sensualism.
A former member of. the Salvation Army
joined the sect, and brought with him what
Hauptmann terms the “systematised orgi-
asm” of that organisation.
The sect of the Valley Brethern, with
Quint as the secretly arisen Savior, with
its fantastic belief in the approach of the
millennium, at the basis of which was a
conception 2000 years old, resembled those
that had arisen in covin tleps numbers
throughout the long middle ages. Even in
the 19th century sects prospered the germ
of which was a much madder delusion, a
delusion often combined with deception on
the part of some hysterical leader.
After a scandalous scene among the
Brethern, Quint is summoned and sternly
rebukes them. But his personal attraction
had compelled an hysterical girl to follow
him; and when he brings her back to her
home he is accused of having lured her
away, and is stoned by the mob. But he is
unable to shake off the obtrusively ridiculous
following of his devoted disciples. He
breaks up the home of the sect, however, and
sets forth on a pilgrimage at their head.
And by now Quint scarcely saw the Saviour
in the Bible at all any more, but only in
himself and as himself. His language had
always been Biblical, but now his speech
was nothing but repetitions of the words of
Christ. His environment, the credulous be-
lief of his disciples, his persecutions—all
combined to confirm him in his fanatical
belief that he was the new Messiah. And, as
always, unconsciously he was forced to
duplicate the incidents of his prototype's re-
corded life. In a paroxysm of madness he
broke the vessels of a Catholic church, hurl-
ing the well-known words of Christ at the
priest.
■J*
And now his wanderings led him up to
Breslau, the Jerusalem of this latter pro-
phet. In an inn, frequented by the lowest
and most degraded classes of a big city, he
sat at table night after night, a sight for the
curious. And here Mary Magdalene, in the
person of a barmaid, attached herself to his
following. He is driven from the inn, and,
in a scene that resembles the great scene in
Christ’s life, he is arrested for the murder
of the poor, girl that had again followed
him from her home. Quint, eager for mar-
tyrdom, refuges to clear himself; but before
the trial comes on, the real murderer, a
fanatical disciple, who had lost faith in his
master’s mission, hangs himself, leaving a
confession. So this modern world refuses
the new Christ his crufixion; and Quint
wanders off alone. His latter history is un-
known, but a corpse found buried in the
snow on a mountain pass is believed to have
been the remains of Emanuai Quint.
The book is admirably written. Given
the, to many persons, sacrilegious subject,
it is reverently written. Christ is not the
hero, but the poor, lovable Fool in Christ.
The One-Act Play
“S.”: Re Coghlan’s outburst (“It. P.,”
10/3/T2), as to one-act plays—and advice
gratis to authors: Whatever is he talking
about? The few men who have turned their
minds, and their pens, in that direction have
been very sorry afterwards. There is no
“fame,” and, worse still, no money, In the
playlet. Here is an experience of my own,
with 25 years of dramatic criticism and
knowledge of stage requirements. Some few
years ago I constructed, wrote and com-
pleted two one-act plays—-both, in my
opinion, and the opinion of others, strong,
novel and worthy of production. At the
same time, a man on the Melb. Argus
(Chomley) also brought forward a “one-
acter,” and the three were duly offered to
all the Australian managements, J.C.W. in-
cluded. “No opening for one-act plays in
Australia,” was the stereotyped answer all
round. To sum the position up—two of the
pieces mentioned were sold right out to a
visiting Iiickardian sketch artist, and the
third went to London, where it was staged
with great success. No, if a prize or prizes
are to be offered, let them be for three or
more act dramas —that’s what managers
want, and, also, they usually spell money
with a big M, as witness “The Squatter’s
Daughter,” “The Bushwoman,” “On Our
Selection,” etc. It is Boodle v. Art every
time, and Boodle always wins. Never mind
the literary part of the play. As a well-
known manager once tersely put it: “The
Australian atmosphere is there, the situa-
tions are there, the dialogue is crisp; but
there’s something lacking—the money isn’t
there
J. O. Smith (author of “The Miner’s
Trust” and “The Bushwoman”) : I do not
agree with Mr. H. 0. Coghlan’s opinion that
Australian playwrights should “confine their
attention to the writing of one-act plays,”
for the simple reason that the one-act play
is not a commercial proposition as far as
Australia is concerned. How many times
during the last 10 years have one-act plays
been professionally staged in Australia? I
think you might count them on the fingers of
one hand. It is obvious, then, that Austra-
lian managers are not partial to this class
of play, and the Australian author only in-
creases his difficulties when he writes plays
that managers do not want. If the compe-
tition has been suggested with the idea of
stimulating Australian Dramatic Literature
by encouraging writers to try their hands at
this class of work, on the chance of securing
a public production, then it is an excellent
idea and deserves encouragement; but Aus-
tralian authors would find if they confined
their attention solely to the “one-acter” that
they would never reach production except in
a friendly way by amateurs, which earns
neither prestige nor profit.
My advice to the Australian playwright is
to keep pegging away at the stuff that there
is a reasonable chance of disposing of.
Gradually managers will realise that the
Australian public enjoys witnessing the per-
formance of Australian plays, and recent
successes must emphasise that fact, and when
I use the word “successes” I am referring to
its financial meaning, and you can take my
word for it that that is the only meaning
that counts for anything as far as those
much-abused people, the theatrical , mana-
gers, are concerned.
Therefore, fellow-toilers, keep working,
and, above all, keep believing. Don’t throw
up the coward sponge because the time is
not yet fully ripe. One of these days one
of us will write an Australian play that will
be so obviously good that our loyal-hearted
fellow Australian critics will neither sneer
at nor generously patronise it, and in the
meantime those few of us who have enjoyed
the sweets of production will have to get
what small comfort we can from gathering
in the shekels that our erstwhile failures are
daily earning for us.
Spring
Three September-poets, modest little buds
born of the September sun, all in pretty
paper covers, green or blue, all published in
Australia in the glad time of the blossoming
of the wild flowers. Dewed Petals, Lyrics
Sans Ennui, Gup Week and Other Verses —
their titles are redolent of the rising sap
and of the Cup that is cheered. But why
criticise these shy newcomers? Who dares
to dissect the wattle? Why not merely in-
hale their fragrance and chronicle the glad-
some fact that in Brisbane the Lyrics are
sprouting sans ennui, and that in Melbourne
in this glad season one may find Dewed
Petals and Cup Week? But no: these her-
alds of spring have voices; they were not
born —at a £20 publishing fee —to blush
unheard.
From the Ideal Press, Brisbane, comes
Paul Jenner’s Lyrics Sans Ennui (all rights
reserved). Why this unlyrical churlishness?
Does the boronia copyright her fragrance or
the native rose reserve her rights? Even
Paul Jenner’s “Skylark” sings:—
What is a man's world to me?
Commercial contumely!
Yet Paul Jenner reserves all rights! But
lie can surely afford to be charitable, for he
is rich in more valuable things:—
Still can I feel thy turning kiss
Given last night-—ecstatic bliss;
Can Heaven give us greater than thisf
And “Anemone” is beyond all ennui:—
I sit on the prow astride of the bow,
Where the waters are melliferously run-
ning;
There's salt on my lips and spray on my
brow,
While the waves are all sportive and
funning.
And afar is “The Horizon”:— 6
The ocean's blue,
The sky's blue, too.
And ivhere the two blues meet (eternal hiss)
The sky a little pales in its old bliss.
But Paul Jenner is patriot as well as Sep-
tember-poet:—•
The country has not set at nought,
The effort to have our own marine;
And future battles that may be fought,
By allied navies will be wrought —
And the combination will prove supreme.
Better patriot than poet, perhaps—most of
us are. This collection of verses is Ennui
Sans Lyrics.
&
Dewed Petals (Brown, Prior, 165 Queen-
street, Melbourne X will Inot be sold on the
flowdr-stalls. This little book, we are told,
is intended for private circulation. Copies
can be had only of the author, Frederick T.
Macartney. They are ratber charming
petals, and there is on them an indubitable
poetic dew. Thus in “Springtime,” Macart-
ney has caught something of her meaning:
Fare forth to the fields! Spring has come,
and she laughs into bloom
As a maiden who welcomes a lover
Wild daisies, frost-thick, fleck green knolls
with their alternate snow;
Flame-clusters of poppies appear, and lone
buttercups blow
In bare places; by shallow swamp-hollows
the pea flower sways;
And dwarf-bushes dance in a delicate hyaline
haze.
I have sinned, I have sorrowed, have trusted,
have reasoned, denied;
Have scoffed at the folly of preachers, have
scorned the cold pride
Of the scholar; have held no thought ade-
quate, found no word clear;
But a palpitant loveliness speaks of divinity
here.
And he has the sonnet knack, as in “The
City”:—
Drawing my curtain to let in the fresh
Wind of the night, I, like a giant, look
down
Upon the puny motions of the town,
Cooped in the limits of a knotted mesh
Of golden lights, and watch the coupled cars,
With lumined windows curved (as glittering
scales
On some old red-eyed dragon) o'er the rails
Creep through the smoke that wreathes the
bridgewan bars;
(An irregular octette, too confused, too
jumpy, to convey a picture; but the sestette
is better.)
And many hopes swell, many passions rise —
As if upon my shoulders were the weight
Of all men's burdens, making mine less great.
And in my eyes the tears of many eyes
Swirl suddenly; and, linked with all men's
fate,
I seek vague comfort in the scintillant skies.
But the human note sounds more virileiy
in this little “Retrospect” :—
/ wonder if the little heart I craved upon «
tree
One morning when the summer bush was loud
with melody
Grows with the trunk —or have rough storms
scarred out that sign of me?
Youth-tones already silent are, dreams golden
have grown grey.
Flowers fading, must so fair a spring so short
a season stay?
So many strings soon snapping, shall I throw
my lyre away?
No; Frederick T. Macartney is somewhat
more than a September-poet: there is some
basic thought in his verse, some hint of
poesy. If he threw his lyre away, doubtless
the spring would come again, but his melo-
dies are sweet, if thin.
Jt
For the majority of Australians spring
begins on the first week in November, and the
first spring flowers are those that blossom on
the lawn at Flemington. So come the poems of
O’Hara Wood, Cup Week, and Other Verses
(The Specialty Press, Melb.), with their
good tidings. “He tells me to write that he
is sorry to say he thinks that, for the first
time in 10 years, he will be unable to see
the Cup with you.”—From his doctor’s let-
ter. So O’Hara Wood introduces his well-
known “Cup Week” :—
Old pal, in Riverina,
Don't you hear the hum
Of the wireless message,
“ Melbourne Cup Week’s come!’!
Can't you feel the bustle
In Riverina there?
Don’t you hear the rustle
Of the Melbourne air?
Pull at Scott’s and Menzies’!
Crowded at the Grand,
At the other places
Hardly room to stand!....
All the air is breathing,
Horse and girl and gown.
Old pal, in Riverina,
Aren’t you coming down?
For the rest, one gathers that once the
author wrote a couple of' comic opera
librettos; and he reprints, apparently with
approval, excerpts from those compositions;
but “The Banjo and the Violin” (to “Banjo”
Paterson) puts pithily some criticism and
some generous praise; and there are light
verses that have humor, but little likelihood
of permanence.
1 ... , ' ;
A creditable specimen of the average novel
is Designing Fate, by John Sandes (Hodder
and Stoughton, per Sydney Book Club).
The average novel consists chiefly of plot
with little effort at the delineation of char-
acter, except by the easy and crude device of
dialects. The writing is not distinguished.
In making the statement that “The mother
of the twin babies had vanished,” Sandes
cannot refrain from three further useless
lines, embodying the tritest of similes, “as
completely as though the solid earth had
opened under her feet and then closed over
her again.” And a man returning to con-
sciousness from diver’s paralysis could
hardly be expected to, whisper thus:“Dar-
lingj you have called me back from the great
deeps.” That is the sort of speech reserved
for the people who exist only in the average
novel. The author, however, is concerned
solely with his intricate plot, in which,
starting with a man who is ignorant that
he is a father, and a mother who disappears
after having twin sons, the long dreary arm
of coincidence is so overworked that this
critic suspects that Coincidence must have
been an octopus. True, Sandes has cun-
ningly snipped off some of the octopus’s
superfluous arms by calling his novel De-
signing Fate, and allowing his heroine, in
the midst of the conventional marriages afl
round before the curtain falls, to remark:
“Yes, indeed it is strange ; but after all, it
is only the last of a series of what some
people might call the accidents that have
brought you and me together. For myself, I
find it hard to believe that we have found
each other simply through a freak of a fate.
Don’t you?” We do.

gun cartridges has been developed to a science. The
“New Rival” is the standard American black powder
cartridge and hence the best in the world. It can
always be depended upon to give the best results in
any gun, of whatever make. The next time you go
shooting, take some of these cartridges along and try them.
You will then realize what your gun' is really capable of.

The Inky Way.
“Yanco”: In a recent Bulletin, reference is made
to the word “obsessed,” and the way the daily papers
are overworking it. But lam prepared to back “dis-
gruntled” against “obsessed” for the Repetition
Stakes. Every paper in Sydney applies it as the
last word in ’ insults against the opposing political
party. “Disgruntled” (what music there is in it!)
is gradually* .spreading over the papers on the table-
lands, and travelling westward along the plains like
a stout and homeless pig. It will probably shuffle
into Wentworth, and lie down In the main street in
time for Christmas.
The empty editorial chair left by the late Judkins
at the Review op Reviews office, in Melbourne, is to
be occupied by Henry Stead, a son of the late W.T.,
who founded the paper. When W.T. went down in
the Titanic, his two sons, Alfred and Henry, took
over the London office, Alfred as editor and his
brother as managing director. But that plan was
upset by the death of Judkins, and Henry is now
coming to Australia to take over the editorial work.
Henry Stead is still young, and very much like his
father in looks and personality.
“K.0.G.”: In a recent Bulletin an Abo-liar in
South America claimed his high and windy habita-
tion as the loftiest spot on earth where the paper
with the red cover is devoured weekly. I butt in
with another claim. Manaos (Brazil) is, was, or will
be the hottest place out of Hades where the Bulle-
tin is, was, or will be regularly read. Was resident
there one time, and while frizzling to a pale brown
in that oven of exile, “Kodak” and “10-2-4” and
“Ironbark,” assisted by “Jimmie Pannikin” and
“The Religious Editor,” kept me in love with my
own country. Manaos is as close to the Equator as
anyone need want to get, but there is still an Austra-
lian there who can’t live without his “Wild Cat” and
“Answers to Correspondents.” Any Abo-liar who
knows of a hotter place is hereby invited to trot the
furnace out. Singapore and Bourke may enter, but it
will be simply said of them that they “also ran”—-
perhaps that they “walked in with the crowd.”
The £lOOO prize offered by Hodder and Stoughton
(London) for the best novel has resulted in £6OO
going to Rose Macaulay, daughter of the lecturer in
English at Cambridge University, and £4OO to
David Hennessey, described as a “well-known Aus-
tralian author and journalist.” David’s story is
entitled “The Out'aw,” and, according to the ad-
judicators, it is “certainly the best bushranging novel
since ‘Robbery Under Arms.’ ” Hennessey has been
knocking about the world during the past 10 years,
“doing miscellaneous journal Stic work and collecting
material.” Miss Macaulay’s novel is entitled “The
Lee Shore.” When she had written a third of it
she put it aside, and started another called “Views
and Vagabonds,” with which she intended to com-
pete. Then she changed her mind again, revised and
completed “The Lee Shore,” sent it in, and cap-
tured the first price. Two editors, W. Robertson
Micoll and C. K. Shorter, and a lady novelist,
Beatrice Harraden, were the adjudicators.

Maoriland working journalists are about to follow
the example of their Australian confreres, and a
Donvnion organisation has been formed. A schedule
for the improvement of conditions, based upon that
operating in Australia, has been framed, and is now
the subject of negotiation with the proprietors. In
Wellington the proprietors forestalled the Ass. move-
ment by submitting proposals to the ink-men on the
three Wellington dailies. These provided for salaries
at the rate of £8 for chief sub-editors, £7 for
first-assistant subs., £5 10s. for other subs., £7 for
chief reporters, £6 6s. for senior reporters, and £5
ss. for generals, with a sliding scale for juniors and
cadets. The Dominion organisation is asking for still
better terms, fixing the salary of chief subs, at £9;
ass'stant subs., £8; other subs., £7; chief re-
porters, £8; seniors, £7; generals, £6; and so
on. It also demands that 48 hours shall constitute
a week’s work. It is registered with a membership
of over 200, and has a warlike expression in its
eye.
Cheer-oh”: Certainly Life deserves all the borak
that Ruru” pokes (B. 19/9/’l2) at it for the bad break
it made in weeping over the imported figures it took
as the text of a sermon. But “Ruru” might have gone
a bit further while he was about it, and smacked
some more Australian (save the mark) periodicals
for their free use of the scissors and paste-pot. In
the fiction line it is especially noticeable, and the
coolest part of the thing is the cheek which some of
them have to claim to be all-wool pure Australian.
In Sydney alone there is the Sun, which takes" as its
proud motto, “ABOVE ALL FOR AUSTRALIA,” and
in its Sunday issue runs in picture jokes clipped from
the Tatler, London Opinion and other Bull journals,
and in other issues serves up regularly short stories
from the Smart Set, Munsey and various other out-
side mags. In the Comic Australian the most “comic”
and the most “Australian” parts are in the title, be-
cause its best joke lies in the habit the paper has of
calling itself such when about 75 per cent, of
its contents—letterpress and illustrations—are from
non-Australian sources, often unacknowledged. The
orld’s News, from the same office,- certainly has
the grace not to pretend to be anything rpore than
a re-hash of sensational items from imported papers.
Even the great ones of the earth, the Herald and
Telegraph,_ are throwing off daily spasms of English
written serials. The Evening News is doing the
same, and the Town and Country Journal in most
issues gives a yarn full of any characters and coun-
tries but Australian. The Sunday Times very oc-
casionally gives an Australian story by an Australian
writer. The Sydney Mail, until recently, printed
an English-written serial and an Australian-written
short story every week, but latterly it has gone one
better, and gives a serial instalment and a short
story, both Australian.
“Quarter Single”: Re newspaper Headings (B.
26/9/’l2). Monty Grover, now editor of Sydney
Sun, was an artist at fashioning them. Some of his
Argus efforts —few of them got past the sub-editor,
alack I —were masterpieces. “The Sermon on the
Mount” was how he headed his interview with the
Winning jockey of a bygone Melbourne Cup. “Run
Over By a House” was another startler—but this was
actually true, and no paradox. A house, in course of
removal, had crushed an old man who didn’t stand
clear of the wheels of the jinker. Before this, when
11. H. Champion ran his weekly, the Champion (long
ago vanquished), Grover gave him the heading, “The
Quick and the Dead” for his sporting column. “The
Old Adam and the New Eve” was his crosshead when',
as sub-editor of the Sydney Morning Herald in
later years, it fell to his lot to find a line to de-
scribe the riotous behavior of Sydney’s male citizens
towards other people’s girls one rowdy New Year’s'
Eve. “Butchery in a Bakery” strove to get int 6
print in the Argus, as the heading for a particularly
gory murder in a baker’s shop. This, for literal
appropriateness, was neck-and-neck with another un-
printed heading devised by McCulloch, then M the
Age, for the case of a youth who pretended that ho
was a pirate, and in that pretence achieved realities
which brought him before the City Court. The line,
which McCulloch wrote at the top of his copy was,
“A Bit of Kidd.”
Those who have watched the generally
dull proceedings of the N.S.W. Upper
House of late are surprised to see the fall-
ing-off in Pilcher, Iv.C. The formerly alert,
pugnacious lawyer, clear on facts, mostly
sure on law, and quite seised of the points
of the measures under discussion, is now
querulous, halting and unreliable on details.
He has made a gallant fight for 25 years
against the Legislative Council’s atmo-
sphere ; but it has got him at last. The only
survivor among the elder band who can hold
his own now is MacLaurin. Pilcher has
reached a stage of Conservative atrophy
which makes him incapable of considering
new ideas; and even the arrival in the
House of his quondam associate in the
“Prudent Federalist” ranks. Dr. Doyle, has
not made him sparkle up.

any injury to the general health; though it
often reduces excess weight by as much as a

Son and Hair.
A revival of whiskers is imminent in London,
Specimens were displayed at a recent fashionable
wedding, and young bloods are airing “side-boards,”
“goatees” and “imperials” in high places.
The Johnnie boy who yesterday
Believed himself supremely It,
And thought that he had come to stay,
With mo. and whiskers wiped away,
Is on the limit of a fit;
In London town the lordly nuts
Are training sprigs and tufts and jutsi,
Of hair upon their mouths to cling,
And mutton chops are just the thing
’Tis not good form the face to strip.
Once more the callow youth must strain
Ilis barber’s genius to equip
With tender shoots his upper lip.
The fact is, hair has come again.
And soon Augustus, deah old chap,
Will lord it in a “squatter’s gap,'
Or shake with a contented mind
Sublime “Dundrearies” in the wind.
The blithest stroller on the Block
Will have great doormats on his chin,
Or simpering little flappers knock
With his full, prehistoric shock,
Where lately whiskers were a sin,
There’ll be no takers for a kiss
That won’t remind the blushing miss
Of smothering in bales of tow,
Or scrapping with a buffalo.
’Tis right and proper; man was made
To deck his chiv with shaggy sprays
Of every texture, shape and shade ;
And, like the warhorse, unafraid,
Go clothed with whiskers all his days.
Our native state is woolly, so
Must Willie let his whiskers blow
For maiden fancies change, I vow,
■'Did Cupid has a goatee now.

—Loyal news item.
I see in Nineteen Thirty-two
A drunk who knows not soap.
(I may explain I see him through
The prophet’s telescope).
He thumps the bar all wet with drink,
And shouts at some poor dunce,
“Look at me now! You'd never think
That I had money once!
“You’d never think I’d been a nob,
An’ drove me moter-car,
To ’ear me arskin’ for a bob
In this ’ere blanky bar!”
The Simple Simon eyes the wreck
So full of rage and drink;
I see him shake his head and neck,
I see his dim eyes blink.
The beat swells up with beerish pride
And breathes upon his prey.
How can his victim step inside,
Or, stifled, edge away!
Two bloodshot eyes hold him in thrall,
A grimed hand grips his sleeve.
No shuffling now! He must hear All
For oh ! he cannot leave !
“I ’ad me ’ouse at Darlin’ Point,
Belonged to all ther clubs:
They welkimed me in ev’ry joint,
Them days I paid me subs.
“An’ I was loval too. you bet!
I stood fer King an’ Throne!
When Noo South ’ad Lor’ Denman set,
I paid ’is rent alone!
“You ’ear that, boy! I paid ’is rent!
I owned ’im, you might say!
/ was ther blanky Guvermint! !
An’ look at me to-day!”
I see him gaze on that damp wreck —
He looks extremely blue
Ard shakes his silly head and neck
In Nineteen Thirty-Two.

KODAK.
In Golden Weather.
All day long beside the river
I beheld the lucerne quiver;
Dreaming, doubtless, of the sea
Flowed the river quietly.
Green cicadas shrilling, noising
In the tall trees, and a poising
Hawk aloft in golden light
Were life’s only sound and sight.
Yet, at times, from far woods floating,
Came a bell-bird’s silver noting,
And, at times, like jewelled things,
Screaming parrots flashed their wings.
Borne on breezes stole the fruity
Scent of orchards, and the beauty
Of the river broad and bright,
Filled and thrilled me with delight.
Said I: “Hour of light and splendor,
In a rich regard and tender,
I shall treasure you—shall hold
Like a jewel set in gold.
“Here,” I said, “Dark Death disdaining
Life in gorgeous godship reigning,
Sovereign lord of great and small—
Is sole ruler over all.”
Then —red death in golden weather!
Was it fur or was it feather,
Plume or tuft, the poised hawk saw
As he swooped down, beak and claw?
Soon a chill came o’er the river,
And I saw the lucerne quiver.
Now, I wonder fitfully,
If a hawk hangs poised for me.

HALLEY Motor Lorries
J
Any Class of Body Fitted to
the Halley Motor Lorry.
CHEAPER QUICKER MORE RELIABLE.
Halley Lorries cost less to run, per mile, than horse teams. This claim is based
upon the most careful calculations. These show a good margin in favor of the Halley.
In the most important matter of speed the Halley shows a superiority of quite
four times the speed of horse teams. This brings the markets nearer, and often
means the gaining of the best prices. The Halley, moreover, does not tire. It
performs its work at the end of a long trip with an undiminished efficiency impossible
to flesh and blood traction.
The Halley in backing up to a siding uses the same full power as in advancing.
Only the “polers” of a horse team back—with ruinous results and delays. The Halley
is not impeded by rough or hilly roads.
The Halley is SIMPLE, ACCESSIBLE and FREE FROM BREAKDOWNS.
It holds Special Award and Gold and Silver Medals for these very features.
To Carry from 15cwt. to 6 Tons.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-

the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE 53 DECAYING COUNTIES OF
NEW SOUTH WALES, AND THE
MANY STAGNANT COUNTIES
BESIDES.
Certain census returns just to hand cast a
light upon the Congestion policy, or One-
Bloated-Gity policy, of N.S.W. The State
has had 34 Governments —the 34th, and
about the most disappointing of the lot (be-
cause it began with such high pretensions
and failed so miserably) is’on deck to-day.
And all these Governments have discoursed
more or less about land settlement. In late
years they have discoursed more than usual
and done less than the average. For this
the Congestion policy has been largely re-
sponsible. The people of Sydney have been
afflicted for a long while with a craze or
madness for dragging all the trade and in-
dustry of a great State to their own port,
and have preached the gospel of the One
Bloated City till it has become a weariness.
They have acquired a sort of idea that they
know everything about commerce, and that
the folk of countries like England, Scotland,
France, Germanv, Italy, the United States,
Canada, Russia, Brazil, Chili, Argentina,
etc. —who all believe in encouraging the
trade of a deep water port wherever they
can find one —know nothing. These coun-
tries receive and send out deep-sea ships
from a multitude of coastal cities. The little
island of Great Britain, for instance, which
could be put in a corner of N.S.W., reckons
that it has 24 notable inlets and outlets for
oversea trade, and some smaller ones be-
sides. Liverpool and London run about
abreast in the matter of tonnage, with Car-
diff close up, and the great port of London
is content with about one-sixth of the total
business that is doing. But certain bru-
tishly selfish Sydney papers are possessed
with an incurable desire to drag every pen-
n’orth of commission and interest and profit
. to their own office doors, and their wildly
anti-British theory is that there must
always be one central port for foreign trade,
and that everything must converge there,
whether such an arrangement be payable
to the country at large or not. The system
involves the building of enormous lengths
of not very profitable railway. It makes
industry almost impossible in the outlying
sections of the State, partly because of the
cost of dragging goods over so many need-
less miles, and partly because of the delays
that arise when practically all the trade of
a province nearly four times the size of
Great Britain is jammed into one bottle-
neck in the struggle to reach a city that lies
on a narrow and difficult peninsula. All
this sort of thing not only retards settle-
ment, but it wipes out settlement that had
been accomplished before the congestion
craze reached its present height. It pre-
vents the arrival of population. It makes
great harbors which—if they were allowed
the railway facilities which Sydney enjoys
—might be equal in value to Sydney or Mel-
bourne or Liverpool or Glasgow, remain
mere waste places contributing nothing to
the revenue, and showing hardly any more
signs of civilisation than they did when
Dampier or Pelsart or Tasman were wan-
dering _ round these shores. In short, the
policy is one of hopeless and unchristian sel-
fishness, which hasn’t even the merit of
being intelligent selfishness.
* * * *
The Congestion or One-Bloated-City
policy is producing the sort of results that
might be expected. It aims at creating arti-
ficial distances, and at making a great part
of the State as far away as possible from
any available outlet for foreign commerce.
Its purpose is to turn those places which
are too remote from Sydney to make for-
eign trade via Port Jackson possible,
into a desert. The wicked and foolish
idea of the congestionists is to destroy the
State, except such parts of it as are con-
veniently adjacent to Sydney and (inci-
dentally) Newcastle. Newcastle, by reason
of its coal deposits, asserted itself, despite
all that Sydney could do, so it has to be
tolerated as an unavoidable evil. The Ma
State is divided into 141 counties, and when
the figures of the census of 1901 were com-
pared with those of 1891, it was found that
43 of them were losing population. This
was not the first time that such a pheno-
menon had been observed, but it had never
before appeared in such an aggravated
form. The 43 counties represented 110,070
square miles of country out of the 310,700
which constitute the land of the Ma Com-
munity. The falling away, in some cases,
represented a very big failure. Barrona
lost over two-thirds of its population in ten
years. Booroondarra lost nearly one-half.
Farnell lost nearly two-thirds—and so on.
The population of the State (including
Lord Howe Island and men on board ships
in harbor) increased in ten years by 230,892
souls —at least some of them were souls
and some were Foreign-traders, and some
were mere believers in the Congestion
policy. Of this the two counties in which
Sydney and Newcastle stand accounted for
127,170, and a handful of more or less ad-
jacent districts stood for the balance. Still,
the decade included the period of the bank
breakage, the low-price era, the era of great
depression, and the worst of the backblocks
drought, so the trouble was set down by
many people to natural causes. Many
other people weren’t intelligent enough to
know that anything unusual was happen-
ing.
* * * *
Then the drought passed, and the depres-
sion passed, and the period of low prices
passed. The boom came, and with the
boom arrived an era of big loans to make
everything especially gay. New Govern-
ments eventuated, and they whooped up the
land settlement doctrine harder than any
Governments which went before them. Pro-
tection came, and manufactures grew faster
than they had ever done before, and popula-
tion began to expand at an unusual rate.
Therefore, when the census of 1911 was
taken it might be supposed that the back
country would at last show fair results.
Unfortunately the policy of dragging all im-
port and export trade to Sydney, and plant-
ing all manufactures at Sydney, and mak-
ing all railways terminate at Sydney had
grown worse in the interim. So, at 1911,
it was found that 53 counties out of 141
were losing population (as compared with
43 under much worse circumstances ten
years earlier) ; and 129,434 square miles
"(out of the total of 310,700) were being
depopulated, as against the previ< us record
of 110,070 square miles. Some of the dis-
tricts which were losing population in the
years 1891-1901 were not losing in the years
1901-1911, but so manv new districts had
got on the decayed list that there were ten
more counties and 19,364 more square miles
of country doing a perish than was the case
ten years previously. And many other
counties which weren’t actually decaying
showed such miserably small increases that
to talk of them as nrogressing was an ill-
timed jest. Thus the population of Flinders
(2415 square miles) increased by 12 per-
sons in ten years: that of Poole (2013
square miles) by 32; that of Farnell (3008
square miles) by 89; that of Selwyn (1906
square miles) by 48; Tandora (2395 square
miles) by 42; Werunda (2395 square miles)
by 10; and so on. The good seasons, the
prosperity, the high prices, the boom, the
immigration policy, the land settlement
policy—-all these had been so completely
neutralised by the Congestion or One-
Bloated-City curse that the wasting or
dying or stagnant nrea of the State had in-
creased instead of diminished. Also, the loss
of population in the dying area was almost
three times as great during the period 1901-
1911 as in the years 1891-1901. Over a
great area of N.S.W. the downhill tendency
has become chronic. There were, in 1911,
46 counties (out of 141), representing
118,713 square miles (out of ol0,700),
which had less population than they pos-
sessed 20 years previously. And some coun-
ties had less than they possessed 30 or 40
years # #
The increase in the tally of the Ma State’s
inhabitants in 1911, as compared with 1901,
was 291,888, of which the Sydney and New-
castle districts accounted for 182,297. So
the proportion of the new people who are
driven into the two cities, and most of all
into Sydney, grows steadily greater. Sydney
stands for a larger and larger percentage of
the population of the State. In 1871 it con-
tained 2734 out of every 10,000 N.S.W. in-
habitants. In 1881 it contained 2993. The
figure was 3386 in 1S91; 3590 in 1901; and
3870 in April, 1911. Probably to-day about
4000 out of every 10,000 cornstalk inhabi-
tants are compressed into the bloated
metropolis. As it bloats, with its special and
exclusive railway privileges the area upon
which population is dying out grows larger,
as already pointed out. Manufactures
everywhere outside Sydney diminish. Out-
ports like Jervis Bay, Twofold Bay and
Port Stephens used to load their
own ships for England, in the days
when there were no railways, and
when any port which had a practic-
able road to it was as good as any other port.
When the great, bulgy central city got its
railway service, and was able to deny rail-
ways to the other deep-water harbors of the
State, all that came to an end. There are
many bad features in the case, but the worst
feature of all is the steady expansion of the
area which is. being abandoned, and of the
other area which remains stationary.
* * * *
It isn’t the worst country that is per-
ishing in this fashion. The region that is
dying out certainly includes a great space
in the West —some of it good, some bad, and
some indifferent, though part even of this
region should be the garden of N.S.W., for it
lies at the meeting place of two of Australia’s
biggest rivers, and it is handy to Melbourne,
Portland, and various S.A. harbors, if parish
jealousy would only allow it means of com-
munication. But the dying section of the
Ma State also includes a large region in the
East, much of it better watered and more
fertile than any land in the immediate
vicinity of Sydney. It includes the country
adjacent to two of the best harbors in the
S tate —Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay—besides
areas in the North. There is nothing wrong
with these places except that tfiey aren’t
near enough to Sydney to trade profitably,
and the mean and hog-like spirit of Sydney
won’t let them make use of the ports at their
doors. People can be got in abundance to
settle this country, as the increased settle-
ment in the county of Cumberland shows;
but the bitter locaiism of Sydney won’t let
people get at the vacant spaces. N.S.W. has
some rare distinctions of its own. Among
all the white man’s countries that count for
much in this world, it tries to shove a larger
proportion of its population on to a smaller
proportion of its area than any other. It
is depopulating a larger proportion of its
area in the interests of Congestion than any
other. It is almost the last allegedly civi-
lised State on earth to adhere to the idea of
closed ports—the idea which the Spaniards
and such-like people used to admire two or
three centuries ago, but which almost all of
them have now abandoned. There is no
other country which, needlessly and out of the
mere cussedness of the Dark Ages, drags its
goods over so many useless miles in order
to inflate the vanity of one city and to
gratify the pride and increase the profits of
the Tory papers thereof. And it is getting
its reward in due course.
* * * *
A big city—especially one which is
crowded up against a tangle of water-ways
and can’t expand all round —presently finds
itself considering two alternatives. Its
people may live piled up like ants in huge,
suffocating tenement houses, and be near
their work; or they may spread far out, and
live decently, and spend a disastrous amount
of time and money getting to and from their
work. In the former case the race de-
generates. In the latter case there is fierce
competition for the houses that are nearest to
the business centre, and one man bids above
another till rents become huge and op-
pressive. Then the fool electors who vote
for the fool (or scoundrel) politicians who
stand for the congestion and suffocation and
high-rent policy complain bitterly because
they get what they have asked for. Every
closed port along the N.S.W. coast makes
Sydney rents higher. Every inhabitant who
is driven out of any one of the 53 perishing
counties of N.S.W., and forced to come
closer in to Sydney, so that he won’t be
ruined by needless railway mileage, makes
Sydney rents higher. Also, all these people
and influences tend to congest Sydney streets,
to block Sydney trams, and to run Sydney
into a bill for several millions for improved
means of city communication. All of this
is what Sydnev has been asking for, and the
great City of Bloat has no right to complain
It is even a question, considering the policy
it has pursued, whether its rents are as high
as it deserves.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Beginning of the War.
Montenegro, the kingdom which consists of
a few rocks, some goats, a handful of villages,
some thousands of men armed to the teeth,
and a tremenduous rerotation, has thrown
down the challenge to the wreck of the em-
pire of the Ottoman Turks, to fight to a
finish for the heavy-weight championship of
the Balkans. Somewhere near his old for-
tress of Obod that tremendous patriot and
stoushmaster, Ivan the Black, is supposed
to be still sleeping in a cdve until the time
is ripe, or the bugle calls, or the guns are
sharpened, or something, when he will rise up
and finally drive the Ottoman Lurk out of
Europe. Ivan didn’t like the Mohammedan
person in 1480, and, as that wearer of
baggy pants hasn’t improved since, either in
his manners or morals, it seems as if a point
had been reached when the old Serb warrior
couldn’t stand any more of him, and had
risen up at last to reach for him with a
straight left. Montenegro looks a very small
thing on paper. It has only a population of
311,000, and a revenue of less than £150,000
a year. Also, 77 per cent, of its people can
neither read nor write. The metropolis of
the State is a village of 5000 peasants, and
its king is not nearly as well oil as the
average person who keeps a shop in a Syd-
ney suburb. On the other hand, ever since
the battle of Ivossovo in 1359, Montenegro
has firmly and even violently declined to be
trampled upon, oppressed, or otherwise mal-
treated by any person, however big or ugly
he might be. For 500 years every Monte-
negrin has been taught to believe that the
first and foremost business for which he
exists is to keep his country free and inde-
pendent, that valor in battle is the highest
of all virtues, and that the citizen who won t
train to defend the place that gives him
bread—even if it is only black bread, and
scanty at that —is not worthy to have a
country, or bread, or any old thing. The
army has a fighting strength of 40,000, which
is only about the number with which the
Boers held on to their territory with such a
bull-dog grip; but, as every man is in the
habit of carrying his rifle with him wher-
ever he goes, and never forgets,, that his
life work is to use it, that 40.000, under
a good leader, might hurt a great many
Turks before it was counted out, or killed,
or persuaded that it would be better at home
in bed. Montenegro doesn’t shirk when it
comes to military service, doesn’t hand its
work of defence over to children, and doesn’t
find in its religious views conscientious, ob-
jections to doing its duty. Even the priests
bear arms and go into the fighting line like
any other soldiers. Indeed, the Montenegrin
priest is a very remarkable person, for he
puts in his day’s work in the field like. a
peasant, attends to his drill like a recruit,
and gets in all his spiritual effects in his
overtime. His reward for all this is the
special right to wear whiskers, and he wears
them with a mild ferocity worthy of his
mixed calling. The Balkan turmoil has
been seething for a very long time, but there
would be a sort of poetic justice, or general
fitness of things, if the one little State that
for 500 years spoke the most emphatic sort
of curse word in the beard of Islam should
be the one to raise the final uproar which
made Turks of less account in Europe than
McGowen in the N.S.W. State Ministry.
Everybody wants peace in the Balkans, but
everybody—except certain children of Israel
who hold Turkish bonds —would be delighted
to see Montenegro win on a clean knock-out
somewhere about the fourth round.

Closing Up the Industries.
The true tale of “Frank Croson” :
The closing down of the big match factory at
Richmond (Melb.) —the biggest and best-equipped
match factory south of the line—followed by the
stoppage of a smaller factory at Fitzroy, and pre-
ceded by the closing of the Oriental Timber Mills
at Geelong, and the partial cessation of toil at
Mitchell’s Richmond Cement Works, simply
yells for an instalment of the adequate Protection
against foreign competition that Australia has so
often been promised by lying politicians. The
case for the match manufacturers is that they have
sunk £150,000 of capital in the business, and they
have to earn interest thereon. Their buildings and
plant obviously cost more than similar enterprises
wo.ukl cost the foreigner, because the Australian
unionist demands ever-increasing wages. The raw
material costs more, because the person who makes
it demands twice the English rate of remuneration;
and the people who make the matches want three
or four times English rates. The manufacturers
and their employees have asked for Protection and
cannot get it. in reply to this the Foreign Trade
organs and certain Labor leaders say: (1) The
matches are not as good as imported matches;
(2) there is a combine; (3) it is a scheme to
monopolise the Australian market, and then reduce
wages and raise prices to the consumer. The first
plea is the usual one of the Stinking Fish pur-
veyor, and should be scouted by every Australian.
The matches are made by the same processes and,
machinery, and out of the same materials that the
foreigner uses; if the product be inferior it is there-
fore manifestly the fault of the, employees—Aus-
tralian men and women. Either they are loafers or
fools—that is what the charge amounts to; and if
any Labor member is game to say it openly, instead
of hinting at it in sidelong fashion, I wouldn’t give
much for his seat at next election. As to plea No.
2 : There is no evidence of any combine, and if there
were, and it were injurious, there is a law to deal
with such things. Does the Labor Government pro-
fess that it is such a dolt that it can’t deal with
combines save by destroying industries? And, any-
how, none of the 400 employees was ever known
to have refused his or her wages because the money
was combine-tainted. As to plea No. 3, if the Aus-
tralian market for matches were captured, and the
firm proceeded to reduce wages, there is the Federal
Arbitration Court to appeal to, and the State Par-
liament will accord a Wages Board for the asking;
and with the precedent of the present scale of wages
the employers would have no hope of getting a
general reduction fixed. Just, here it may be as well
to indicate brieflv what those wages were. Engin-
eers got from £3 6s. to £5 per week; carpenters,
£ 3 8 s. Girls—the bulk of the employees—got,
according to the company’s signed pay sheets for
this year, 425. 6d., 345. 2d., 28s. 4d., 525., 335., 355.,
335., 455., 365., 455., 525. 6d., 345., and so on, per
week of 48 hours. In England Bs. (eight shillings)
a week is quite common. This is the heaviest handi-
cap under which the company labors—and it finds
it can’t carry on! There is no need, to tell the
Australian, man or woman or girl, that, these are
fair wages as times go; and even if if were “com-
bine’’ money, and if the public had to pay more for
its matches than it does, the fact that 4(Jo men and
women receive those wages would still k make the
industry worth preserving. (Matches are,’ too cheap,
anyhow, else they wouldn’t be wasted as they are.)
The Australian is entitled, not only to the use, but
to the monopoly of his home market, and it is the
business of those in authority to see (3 ). that he gets
it; (2) that he adequately remunerates those assist-
ing him in supplying it—his employees'; and (3)
that he doesn’t abuse his monopoly, by overcharging
the public. As regards matches, neither lie nor the
foreigner, also alleged to be a has over-
charged the public so far; but,-in case he should
take a fancy to do so, it is the -business of
that Permanent Tariff Board that should have been
in existence by , the end of 1910, to so' regulate the
Customs duty—varying it according to necessity
from time to time—that the Australian' manufacturer
shall, while having a monopoly of (his own market,
be unable to raise his prices to any absurd figure.
Parl’ament, babbling endlessly over the whole tariff
question, could not hope to do this; but a small,
compact body of experts, acting on fhe information
of accredited agents—Customs _ officers, factories
inspectors, and the High Commissioner's and Agents-
General’s staff, could. But genirne Protection must
come first. Britain, Germany, the United States, Canada
and other countries —even Japan—have built or are
building up their industries by Protection, and Pro-
tection only ; while Australia has as yet hardly begun
to manufacture. And the few trifling industries it
possesses it is strangling, at the behest of the
importer, the fat man and the fool Laborite who
doesn’t know on which side his bread is buttered.
Meanwhile, those 400 Richmond men and women,
formerly earning wages which kept them and their
dependents in decent comfort, are unemployed, while
the foreigner works overtime. They, as well as
their employers, recently asked the Federal Govern-
ment for Protection —they suggested a minimum
duty of 2s. per gross—and they haven’t got it 1

be all right in the case of a fall of water as it is
available at Niagara. A steam plant to generate
electricity is to be installed, and the scheme is to
add to it, unit by unit, as the demand for power
increases.
Of course, the Cotter, which the Sydney
Telegraph’s fishing expert described as a
mere “chain of waterholes” won’t generate
electricity. But why quote Niagara? There
are hundreds of smaller streams—provided
a river is swift and permanent it doesn’t
require to be large —which supply towns
with electricity. Thus Launceston (Tas-
mania) has a small but hurried river called
the South Esk, and by impounding a mere
fraction of the water —not enough to make
any visible difference to the scenery—Laun-
ceston supplies itself with cheap light and
with power to run its tramcars. If the
whole of the South Esk was harnessed it
could run half the industries of Australia.
A chain of waterholes —even a big chain —
won’t run anything, but a little river in a
desperate hurry can be so employed that it
will even shift the Ten Commandments.
The Snowy, which hurries down from Kos-
ciusko past the rejected capital site at Dal-
gety, could push all the engines of N.S.W.
if properly applied. But poor old Canberra
must depend on machinery run by steam to
light its streets, and coal must be humped
great distances to it at great expense for
ever and a day. And all because a wretched
crowd of parochialists insisted on a mean
capital close to Sydney, when they might
have had, a little further away, a city
worthy to be the metropolis of a continent.
The Casual Worker.
During the recent Eight Hour celebrations
ex-Prime Minister Watson got off a remark
which. Labor should write out in letters a
foot limb. and paste in it¥ hat for reference.
He said that, despite all the increases in
wages, it is hard for a man in casual em-
ployment to make ends meet. And where
the employment is sufficiently casual, it cer-
tainly is hard. Labor should make a note
of this. There are abundance of jobs that
are r,ot casual—notably the making of boots,
clothes, hats, blankets, sheets and other plain
necessaries of life. In these lines there is
always work to be done, provided the country
has intelligence enough to take hold of it.
Whenever this work shows signs of scarcity
the tariff can be pushed up, so that it
will be the imports that will be reduced in
a period of financial shortage—not the local
output and the supply of local wages, lhe
tariff should be capable of as rapid adjust-
ment to meet sudden changes in the position
as are wages, or the interest and discount
rates of the banks, or the salaries ot
politicians. Unhappily the whole Labor
policy seems to aim at giving the
steady work to outsiders, and keeping the
unreliable jobs for Australians. . lhanks
to the system of pushing the nominal wages
up (the high wages are becoming very
nominal in some industries), while keeping
the customs duties down, the country imports
far more than it manufactures of the goods
which are always in demand. Then it is
the policy of Labor nowadays to keep the
number of apprentices so low in such skilled
industries as the country possesses that these
industries can’t expand (in fact, they must
actually die out) unless they are fed by the
importation of ready-made workmen from
England and elsewhere. Whether the in-
dustries die. out, or whether they are main-
tained by the importation of workmen, the
policy is to keep the young Australian out
of the constant jobs, and, so far as possible,
to keep these jobs out of the country. It
aims at making an absurdly large propor-
tion of the community dependent on the
businesses which crumple up like wet blot-
ting paper in bad times. Navvies and such-
like lose the number of their industrial mess
by droves whenever the loan doesn’t float.
Builders and their laborers depend largely
on the loan boom, for that does a great deal
to prop up the building boom. A big drought
has, before now, wiped out half the sources
of revenue on which shearers, cattle men and
the like rely. Professional footballers,. ath-
letes, actors, traders, speculators, miners,
pafcel-carriers, and their sort are all crea-
tures of luck and circumstance. Meanwhile
the trades that go on for ever (the wages
and profits may diminish in bad seasons, but
the work remains, and the local market
remains) are saved up with a careful hand
for outsiders —some of them very objection-
able outsiders. That fact makes the lot or
the casual person far worse than it should
be, as well as making the casual far more
numerous than he should be. And as for
the reason of it all, the Lord onlv knows.
o
Willis —a Great Man.
Dear Bulletin, —Rarely is a man a pro-
phet in his own country, nor is the most
splendid of characters a hero in the eyes of
his valet; also, none but distant hills look
recTy green. All of which somewhat trite
reflections go to buttress my view that
N.S.W. Speaker Willis is one of the few
politicians approximating to the Great Man
class in N. S. Wales to-day. A great man
is one of the hardest possible things to
define. He may be humorless, like Napo-
leon ; unintellectual and to a large ex-
tent unscrupulous, like Marlborough ;
pompous, and in many respects petty-
minded, like Johnson ; or plain demented,
like Mahomet. He may be a provincial
pettifogger, like Benito Juarez; or a pig-
dealer, like the first Obrenovitch. It is
when, despite such disabilities, . he beats
down formidable opposition and rises to the
top, in his own sphere, and stays there that
we say hi is great. And the greater the
handicaps he has to face, and the harder
the assaults made on him are, the more con-
siderable he proves himself to be, assuming
as aforesaid, that he manages to cope with
the same successfully. Willis, on his pub-
lic performances during the past 12 months,
is entitled to the style or title “great,” if
ever a local product was; and if he could
but be regarded from afar, so to speak, and
unbiassed by political frenzy, the justice of
his claim would become apparent to the
most astigmatic of Tories. He appears . to
have courage, moral and physical, of a. high
order. When the leaders of the Liberal
party were surging round him 10 months
ago, with missiles in their Lands and slaugh-
ter in their eyes, he didn’t turn a hair. Since
then he has faced the same infuriated band
or “push” on various other occasions, and
he has acquitted himself well on all of
them. As regards his moral bravery, there
can be no question. He has dared, to go
back on his partv, in what he conceived to
be the cause of duty. He has thus alienated,
in all likelihood, about 80 per cent, of his
personal friends. And he has not hesitated
to jump on a powerful daily paper in the
most forcible way on record. His achievements
speak for themselves. In the course of one
brief year he has transformed the N.S. Wales
Assembly from an anarchistic and disre-
putable bear-garden, where every one of the
rules, and. most of the decencies, of debate
were habitually fractured; where many of
the attendants were as lawless and alcoholic
as the bulk of (he members; and. where
there was practically no authority of
any sort; into a comparatively decently-
conducted institution. If he only had
power to lodge about a dozen M’s.L.A. in
an inebriates’ -home for six months or so
things would be even more satisfactory. (Of
course, given the power, there is not the
remotest doubt that he would exercise it.)
He has done all these things, in the teeth
of the most harassing opposition. Every
imaginable and unimaginable point has
been taken against his efforts in the direc-
tion ,of reform, not only in the House itself,
but the leading columns of the daily
papers, and likewise in the portions devoted
to “Pro Bono Publico,” “Loyalist,” and so
forth. It is a tribute to the accuracy and
extent of his knowledge of his job that in
the course of 12 strenuous, infuriated
months he has only definitely fallen in a
couple of times. Picture a doctor cr solici-
tor or other professional man, heckled by
40 or so experts for a year on end, on the
subject of medicine or law, as the case
might be. Would he acquit himself a thou-
sandth part as creditably as Willis? The
writer trows not. And then there is the
amazing endurance,- mental and physical,
that is represented by the Marathon con-
test which he has r>ut up. Here is the con-
fession made to his party press by an ex-
Premier; the great White Hope of N. S.
Wales Liberalism (or perhaps he should be
called the White Slope) ; a man who played
football for Oxford, and subsequently for
England; and who, later, tore burning
miners out of the flooded bowels of the
earth or tore the bowels ou't of flooded
miners or something, with his own strong
hands
“I have determined,” Mr. Wade explained, “to go
away for a good rest. Many members o i the party
have urged me to take a substantial holiday, and I
have come to the conclusion that it is a wise thing
to do. I cannot help taking this opportunity of en-
dorsing the remark frequently made, ‘How great is
the strain of public life under present conditions.
The continuous sittings in the early part of this year
—five days a week for nearly seven weeks, and each
sitting averaging from nine to 10 hours —left me
and many other members of the House quite ex-
hausted. ’ If these extraordinary and unnecessarily
long hours are to be kept, it will eventually mean
ruin to the health of even the most robust men in
politics. The frequent conflicts with Mr. Speaker
tend to exhaust one’s endurance. Some men are able
to keep their tempers; some are not so able. But
the emotional disturbance of these scenes with the
Speaker are more upsetting than a sudden outburst
which is soon over.”
Work it out as a sum in simple proportion.
If one Willis can, in a year, pulverise the
flower of Liberalism by way of a mere
side-line, as it were (for, remember, that
he had, during this time, to also engage and
defeat the whole of the remainder of that
ravening party), how many hundred Wades
would it take to account for Willis during
the same period? Viewed in its correct
perspective, the Opposition leader’s action
in “skying the wipe,” as they say at the
Stadihm, is the finest tribute a Speaker
ever had paid to him. —Yours faithfully,
Henri Singemoine.
“The Eviction”—and After.
From Sydney Telegraph (9/10/T2) :
There is little doubt that the Government is begin-
ning to realise the difficulty in which it is now
placed with regard to the utilisation of Government
House in the future. As Mr. Carmichael stated
yesterday, it is “a matter of business,” and if Gov-
ernment House is to be converted in any way into a
public resort, money will have to be spent. And it
is on the plea of economy that the eviction of the
Governor-General has taken place. What Ministers
—or rather a majority of them —would like to see
is the house used once more as the residence of the
State Governor. Lord Chelmsford has, of course,
not yet been consulted on this point, but it is
known that several members of the Cabinet hold
the view that in this direction lies the only way out
of the difficulty in which the Government is now
landed.
Vvhen the idea of resuming Federal Govern-
ment House was first broached, the average
N. S. Wales Democrat was inclined to ap-
plaud the move. He took it for granted
that the McGowen Administration had it in
its mind to put (he big place to some import-
ant public use. This view was accentuated
when members of the Ministry mentioned
variously that the house would be turned
into a hospital or a museum or a Music Con-
servatorium, or what not. For months no
one dreamt of accusing the McGowEN-ites
of mala fides in this matter. The deplorable
truth —namely, that the Government was
manoeuvring to expel the Governor-General
from his Sydney residence in order to in-
stall the State Governor there —did not
occur to one Laborite in a thousand. This
paper first tentatively advanced the theory
that the whole agitation against the Gov-
ernor-General was bogus, regarded from a
democratic standpoint, in April last; and it
suggested then that, if an admixture of
blackmail and parish-minded yearning to
embarrass the Australian Government
weren’t at the back of the disturbance, that
appearances were deceptive, not to say libel-
lous. At the time of writing the indications
are that that view was well justified. .The
McGowEN-ites have enthusiastically jetti-
soned the plank in their party platform
which declares for the abolition of the office
of State Governor. In fa'ct, by every means
in their power, they are. seeking to render
that superfluous and costly functionary a
more glittering and influential figure than
he has been any time these 10 years. Such
antics would be understandable enough in
the case of a Tory Ministry. For example,
the thought of ousting the Governor-General
from N. S. Wales, in order to bring about
a reversion to the old order of things, when
there was no Australian Parliament nor
any other institution hateful to the good
Geebung, first originated with Carrtjthers.
But a broader and more national-minded
attitude was expected of the McGowen
Cabinet. Since experience has _ shown that
all such expectations are futile, it may be of
service to expound the idiocy of locating the
State Governor in the Macquarie-street edi-
fice from another standpoint. The thing is
impracticable on purely financial grounds.
Britain has ceased to export the type of
State Governor it did in olden days. The
prestige of the job has waned, and, in conse-
quence, it is no longer sought after by the
affluent. Lord Chelmsford happens to be
so situated, one way and another, that he
could afford possibly to keep up the Gover-
nor-General’s late home during the re-
mainder of his term. But he represents the
exception to the prevailing rule, which is
that State Governors shall be indigent per-
sons, whose choice lies between living within
their official salaries and filing their sched-
ules. But possibly the McGowen combina-
tion —the combination which, as aforesaid,
is solemnly pledged to wipe out the State
Governor and the whole of his absurd en-
tourage —meditates the passing of a short
Act increasing the salary of . the official
whom it is sworn to- abolish —increasing it
sufficiently to enable the purely local Excel-
lency to keep up any old establishment in
the utmost splendor. It would be a weird
move, but not more so than many that this
astounding group of alleged Laborites has
executed in its brief period of office.
Things are going from bad to awful in the
Victorian police force, and the voice of the
sympathetic burglar is heard remarking in
the darkness that if John Hop was half a
man he would chuck up the job and try the
other game. Premier Watt’s budget pro-
mise of another 6d. a day for policemen
from Ist January next has got the old cop-
pers sarcastic, and the young coppers mad.
At time of writing they seemed all agreed
to call a monster meeting for the refuse 1 of
Watt’s half-bob with scorn and derision.
Meanwhile, Watt is up against the fact
that the force, under present conditions, is .
not worth a liberal increase in its pay.

O’Callagitan as Chief Commissioner, the
force /appears less valuable to the public
than ever it was before. Very much in-
creased wages for more active and intelli-
gent guardians of the law is the popular de-
mand. When a sergeant or sub-inspector
predicts a rush of resignations from groan-
ing constables he excites no new alarm
among scoffing members of the unprotected
community. The cry is: “Let ’em all go
and get a fresh lot.” And the desire for the
departure of O’Callaghan is specially
heartfelt. Rightly or wrongly, the man
under whose control the force has talien
into disrepute is now regarded as the stum-
bling block to reform.
Treasurer Watt’s proposal to help finance
the building and repairing of Victoria’s ne-
glected main roads by raising the license
fees on motor-cars —instead of the 225. Od.
per annum they pay now, they will have to
stump up from £2 2s. to £ll Us., according
to horse-power —has roused the ire of motor-
ists, and some are loudly threatening to sell
their weapons and go back to the moke.
They claim that they help make the roads
that iron-tyred vehicles break up, and that
the heavy license fees would be “class taxa-
tion of the worst sort and a hindrance to
enterprise.” To which Watt replies that
they need taxing, (1) because they use the
roads more than ordinary wheeling citizens,
seeing that they cover more road in a given
time; and (2) they don’t use the railways,
and he wants to get their whack out of them
one way or other. Just here is a hint of a
problem that will by-and-bye face all Aus-
tralian communities. The motor-car has
come to stay, and by-and-bye the motor
lorry, waggon, cart, etc., will also dwell here
by the thousand. Now all these vehicles
mean so much less railway revenue, so ap-
parently the day is within gunshot when
the State railways will have to be pulled up
and scrapped, and the engines and the new
Tait cars sold to the highest bidder. And
then Cohen will want to know what has be-
come of the permanent and reproductive
assets in which his monish was sunk. And
all the reply he will get will be a hollow
laugh, and the sound of a door banging in
the distance.
The provincial gait has no happy mediums.
It crawls or it bounds. Bendigo had hardly
recovered from the news that railway work-
shops were coming to its neighborhood than
some of the City Council proposed to ask
the Watt Government to grant free car-
riage from Melbourne to inland centres of
coal, iron and other raw materials for manu-
facturing purposes. The Mayor was some-
what steadied when another councillor sug-
gested that the millers in Melbourne could
as reasonably demand free carriage of wheat
from up-country, but he carried a resolu-
tion of Bendigonian hope that the Govern-
ment would take further measures “to
assure a fair and just distribution of manu-
facturing and commercial interests through-
out the various centres of Victoria.” Ben-
digo’s notion of a proper decentralisation
policy is purely inland, it seems. The
Mayor doesn’t yearn for new railway facili-
ties for Portland, or anything else in the
way of seaport-town development in rivalry
to Melbourne. Bendigo and Ballarat are
the centres where manufacturing and com-
mercial interests should be distributed by
the Government, but seeing that the Gov-
ernment. has nothing much to do —apart
from railway rolling stock —with any busi-
ness, it is not likelv to earn any more votes
of thanks from those aspiring cities.
Dr. Ashburton Thompson, President of
Sydney Health Board, got up lately for the
manyth weary time and said the
usual thing about the municipalities
which are supposed to collect milk
samples. In only three municipalities
—Sydney, Redfern and Newtown—has
sample-collecting been regularly done,
and, as a result, in these districts the doctor
reckons adulteration has practically ceased.
Some nine other municipalities “have done
useful work” ; which means that 60 samples
or so have been taken during the last eight
months. In that period some ,of the other
pocket handkerchief authorities Took a few
samples (the highest was about 40), but
16 took none at all. The gloriously-dirty
16 (they deserve a free advertisement) in-
cluded Annandale, Bankstown, Darlington,
Homebush. Hunter’s Hill,- North Botany,
Ryde, St. Peters, Strathfield and Waterloo.
It was during the time that the blessed
councils were loafing as above-mentioned
that, in one week, , 19. customers of a cer-
tain daii’y went dowm with diphtheria; Dr.
Armstrong took swabbings from the
throats of all the dairy employees, and one
of them yielded an almost pure culture of
diphtheria, though the man was not suffer-
ing from any of the clinical symptoms of
the-disease. he had no sus-
picion himself that he was infected —the
“carrier” generally has no suspicion. * The
employee was segregated, and there were no
more diphtheria cases, It was-lucky the
Health authorities got on) ft he > trail so
briskly. Had matters been left to the
hopeless municipal sample-collector, the
eases wouldn’t have stopped at 19.' Or,
possibly, at 1900. Or, conceivably, at
19.000. Talking at the councils seems as
useless as mentioning the matter in prayer
or breathing it in the ear of alcohol. What
is wanted is a gun or an axe at short rang*-
The Lands that Lag Behind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Take heed of the nerveless nations —the
lands that are Fast Asleep ;
In the camps of the Stronger Feoples there
is laughter loud and deep !
For Life is an endless cycle; and after the
years of war
Come the days when the nations slumber,
and their manhood thrills no more !
They drowse while the earth is stirring, they
sleep while the standards fly;
They dream ’neath their smoking altars
while the strong go marching by!
For this is the Law Unchanging, by the
Courts of Time defined—
Despised by the Hustling Nations lie the
Lands that Have Lagged Behind!
I watched where the broad Hyphasis rolls
down to the Indian Sea —
Where the bones of the Greeks lie mingled
with the dust of the Punjaubee.
’Twas, here that the armies halted, far back
in the stirring years,
When the sleeping East turned over, pricked
deep by the Grecian spears!
’ Twas here that the proud Iskander to his
lords gave fief and charge;
Now, where is the Great Commander, and
where is his empire’s marge?
For the Greeks in their turn lie sleeping,
while the Mills of Progress grind—
And the Land of the Macedonian is a Land
that Lags Behind!
I stood by the Delhi Gateway, where Akh-
bar entered in—
Where the throne of the Sons of Babar
was lost by the Mogul’s kin !
I watched where the Jumna’s waters are
mixed with the Ganges’ stream —
Where the realm that the Strong Man con-
quered grew vague as an ancient
dream !
And; I mused of the Darkened Ages when
Europe sighed and slept—
Ere the days of the Younger Sages, when
the pulse of the West Land leapt!
I saifed with the bearded Spaniard (and
hit keels, they were fouled and lprined')
Towards the isles of the lone Pacific and the
Lands that Had Lagged Behind!
I saw that the tide was turning, saw dawn
through the ages break;
’Twas the soul of the West Land burning
by the narrower sea and lake!
I marched with the lone white legions, while
the East in slumber sank—
While the throne of the Moguls crumbled
and Delhi’s Gateway stank!
I watched while the West, new-stirring,
reached out for its realms again ;
And I heard where the shipyards thundered
for the wealth of the Spanish Main !
The Frank and the Spaniard striving for
the Dutchman’s fiefs inclined—
And Britain, who grabbed the plunder from
the Lands that Lagged Behind!
I stood by the throne of Caesar, by the
throne where the Tarqtjins sate —
And I watched while the mighty legions
went forth from the Empire’s gate!
I saw where their camp-fires flickered, by the
banks of the English Thames —
Where the queens of the slaughtered chief-
tains breathed their lords’ last requiems !
I watched when the last lone galley crept
home with its wrecked machines,
And the Piets of the North leapt southward
o’er the wall of the Antontnes !
I saw when the Hun and Vandal through
the gates of the lined —
Proud Rome from her splendor fallen with
the Lands that Lagged Behind !
Do the lost lands wake from slumber? By
the clang of the Brown Man’s steel—
By the flame of the forges gleaming, and
the sound of the hammered keel:
By the last lone cruisers reeling, Tsu-Shima’s
sunk trireme,
I know that the lost lands waken —it is
Europe’s turn to dream!
She sinks in a death-like slumber, she sleeps
by her Western shore —
Content with her sloth-like vision of the
brave days _ gone before !
,She dreams while the East is stirring!—
O Land with a madman’s mind;
While the Mills of the East are whirring,
is Europe to Lag Behind?
VICTORIA.

A Mining Horror, with the Usual Gleam
of Light.
The North Mount Lyell mine, in Tasmania,
caught fire at about mid-day on Saturday
last. In all the circumstances the occurrence
was not surprising. The wonder is, rather,
that a record conflagration didn’t transpire
there months ago. The chamber-house, at
the 700 ft. level, where the co. kept and
worked a motor, would seem to have been
lined with King Billy pine, a splendid wood
for kindling or match-making, but the most
perilous sort possible for use in garages in
the vasty bowels of the earth. Incidentally,
according to reports from the scene of the
tragedy, the whole of the mine timber, in the
level affected, was dry and inflammable.
That couldn’t well be helped, but the King
Billy pine in the subterranean garage looks
like a needless risk. Furthermore, the cham-
ber where; the blaze originated was littered
with bagging and oily cotton-waste. What
better conditions could have been desired by
the most exigent of incendiaries? Within
a few minutes of the discovery of the fire
the mine-workings were filled with smoke
and poisonous gases. The race for safety
was fast, but the fire was fast also. At the
time of writing 80 of the miners have not
reached the fresh air, and many of them pro-
bably never will. Five bodies have been
recovered, and the countryside is a harrow-
ing spectacle of weeping women and children
and horror-stricken men. Rescue work has
been impeded by the absence of nearly all
those things which are most essential in a
calamity of the kind. Diving suits didn’t
arrive till 24 hours after the beginning of
the agony, and smoke helmets had to be sent
for to Melbourne, and even to Wontliasrgi,
the Socialistic coal-mine belonging to the Vic-
torian GoVernment. They were brought in
red-hot haste by special steamer and train,
and quite regardless of expense—-still, they
should have been on the spot or much nearer
the spot. Amid the prevailing gloom there
is the customary glittering circumstance. It
is, of course, the superb conduct of the
miners, their dogged, “two o’clock in the
morning”. bravery, their complete unselfish-
ness, their devotion to their luckless friends.
The redeeming features of the Australian
miner, like the mitigating qualities of the
British Atkins, only occur to some people
in times of stress and peril. A fragment of
Sydney Telegraph’s tribute is typical of
the rest: —
As one rescue party became exhausted, other brave
miners were ready and anxious to replace them.
At the risk of their own lives, in their desperately
heroic attempts to save their entombed mates the
rescuers penetrated the deadly fumes arising from
the ore, without once faltering, and kept at it until
beaten back, by the poisonous gases. The magnificent
spirit of self-devotion shown made the work truly
noble, and every man there was ready to rise to the
terrible and appalling occasion. Self-sacrifice was
not looked Upon as a virtue, but regarded as a duty.
These are: the same men whom, when in-
dustrial disputes rage or electioneering is in
the air, it is the Tory/custom to picture as
lazy, self-seeking and more or less worthless
citizens whose demands for better and safer
working conditions and increased wages
merit nothing but scorn. Horrors like the
one at Mount Lyell do some good, inasmuch
as they bring home to people of imagination
and decen’i feeling that high wages and the
best possible working conditions are due to
the men who ao in constant peril of their
lives in the depths of the earth, and who be-
have with such magnificent courage when
the periodical tragedv arrives. Also, they
serve to draw public attention to the lament-
ably casual conduct that Private Enterprise
is guilty of occasionally. There is just this
notable difference between the combustible
State-owned mine at Wonthaggi (Victoria)
and the combustible privately-owned mine
in Tasmania —the former had the apparatus
required for rescue purposes, and the latter
apparently hadn’t.
—♦
The Additional Protection that Tudor
Gave to Himself.
“Me. Ocky” writes: Geelong, the biggest
centre of Gorio (Vic.) electorate, which re-
turns a Labor Protectionist to the Austra-
lian Parliament, is going to lose its import-
ant timber mills because of an inefficient
tariff, which T. Tudor, Minister for Cus-
toms, declines to interfere with. He says
he can’t deal with one item without opening
the whole Question, and this highly-paid
talker and jabberer and idler apparently
can’t see that he gets his salary for opening
the question whenever it requires opening.
A. T. Ozanne, M.H.R., comes before the
Geelong electors next year, and will be hard
put to it , to explain the situation. The
owners of. the mills state that, while local
wages keep going up, they are unable to com-
pete with cheap foreign labor under the
existing tariff. So the extensive and valu-
able machinery is to be dismantled and sent
to Siberia. The mills were established at
a cost of something like £200,000. They
are fitted with the best machinery, and have
the advantage of excellent water and rail
facilities-rAhere is everything, in fact, to
enable them soon to double and treble them-
selves, provided they have sufficient Protec-
tion to counterbalance the difference be-
tween Australian and foreign wages. The
Minister won’t give them that because “the
company knew what the tariff was when it
established the mills.” Certainly it did.
But it didn’t know what the wages were
going to be. In like manner Tudor knew
what the salary was when he went into
Parliament, but when he and his friends
found expenses going up, they promptly
shoved up the salary 50 per cent, to meet
the expenses. That loas five years ago, for
Tudor and his friends were very early off
the mark in recognising that they required
some additional Protection. So their pre-
tence of being unable to see that other
people also require additional Protection is
a miserable, loafing hypocrisy.

“Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford” is still
making money for himself and the firm that
runs him at Sydney Criterion. Whether he
is a moral and advisable proposition, either
at the Cri., or elsewhere, is another matter,
and this paper takes up a neutral and
strongly fortified position on the matter.
Wallingford teaches the doctrine of Wild
Cat. He tends to persuade people that
Wild Cat is easy, and that its ways are ways
of pleasantness and all its paths are afflu-
ence. Unfortunately for Wallingford, they
are not, owinc to the absurd amount of
competition. Many a man toils all his life
at Wild Cat, and makes about one-third as
much as he could acquire in a suburban
boot-shop' with one-third the worry. The
business is overdone. It is alleged that every
woman is at heart a barmaid,
wherefore it naturally follows
(1) that every woman sus-
pects the other woman of being
an instinctive barmaid, and
(2) that every woman objects
to the other woman because
she may be an instinctive bar-
maid, and thus be over-crowd-
ing the market. In the same
way, it may be that every man
is, in his inmost soul, a Wild
Cat or a Gold Brick, and,
therefore, the man who says lie
has a rich uncle in Fiji is lia-
ble to be kicked six times by
competitors before he gets a
hearing. And when he does
get a hearing, the chances are
that his listener has either him-
self got a rich uncle in Fiji or
has nothing about him worth
stealing: ' After which moral
reflections, the writer will go
out for lunch and try to get
rid of the bad half-crown.
Clothes may make the man, but this writer
is blowed if scenery makes the play. A bad
play with , good scenery is mud, but a good
play with poor scenery is, to some extent,
bearable. “The Girl Who Took the Wrong
Turning,” at the Adelphi (Sydney), has
some very good mountings, but as a play it
isn’t worth fourpence. The villain is the
same villain who has been helping to fill
the Marlow coffers ever since Marlow had
any coffers, or coffers belonged to any Mar-
low. The bad “ woman is the same bad
woman who has been leading innocent girls
astray since the commencement. The girl
has been led astray in the same manner
millions of times before. The reformed man
has been reformed so often that it is becom-
ing a bad habit. The funny man is the
same blithering jester who has poked his
nose into every bellowdrama, when the hero
could be just as heroic and the villain just
as villainous without him. And the rich
father and his will have been keeping audi-
ences out of bed ever since the first audi-
ence had the first bed to be kept out of.
In fact, the whole show is so much like the
numerous other Marlowdramas that have
gone before it that the only thing to dis-
tinguish it is the date on the programme.
Given these few characters, it seems quite
possible to turn out an almost endless sup-
ply of plays. The only three worth mention
in this particular variation are George
Cross, as the sailor-hero ; C. R. Stanford, as
the reformed convict; and Ethel Buckley,
as a somewhat unnecessary Poppy Slater.
The piece is advertised to start at 7.45, and
the management would do well to see that
it is kept up to time, instead, as was the
case on Saturday night, of holding it up
till after S.

“Queen Bess,” a somewhat lengthy him
being screened at Sydney Lyceum, repre-
sents another step in the advance of the art
of moving picture production. With the
“Divine Sarah” (some day people will grow
weary of the hackneyed phrase, and will
cally the lady “Sally Heaven” for short) in
the title role, and her assistants from the
Bernhardt theatre in the other parts, it is
only natural that the piece is delightfully
acted and well mounted. It includes the
departure of the Armada, a representation
by Sliakspeare of “The Merry Wives,” and
the signing of Essex’s death warrant by the
Queen. The film will be screened through-
out this week.

Mozzetto, at the Tivoli (Sydney), billed
as “one of the world’s finest jugglers,” is
merely another of those too-numerous gentle-
men who do precisely the same as the
thousand’or so of jugglers who have gone
before them, and do it no better. Anyone
can, after a bit of practice, heave a cigar, a
tall hat, and a walking stick round; but
writer is waiting for the man who will
make a pyramid of an electric tram, a wax
match, Speaker Willis, a gas mantle and a
motor lorry, balance the lot on a hair of the
dog that bit him, or, if it didn’t bite him,
should have, and then drink up the dog.
Till that one happens along, this scribe in-
tends to treat this brand of entertainer with
contempt. Mozzetto’s one novel trick js to
throw half a dozen coins into the air simul-
taneously, and catch them one by one. Even
that isn’t much. If he would throw six
debts in the air ‘ and pay them one by one
before they reached the floor, it would be
much more interesting. Welch and Carbasse
are the only pair who have to date escaped
notice, and they are warned that if they
don’t use their talents (they both have
them) to better advantage, they are liable
to continue escaping. When this sees print
La Freya will be a mere speck on the hori-
zon, and her place will remain vacant fill
Saturday, when Miss Margo, “The Mystic
Lady,” or barmaid, who concocts out of Lne
atmosphere any drink ordered, and I)’Arc’s
marionettes will make their first appear-
ances.

On Tuesday next, October 22, the Sydney
Stage Society, whose excellent perfomance
of “You Never Can Tell” was, in many re-
spects, more artistic than the professional
performance that followed, has a triple bill
at the Standard Theatre—-Shaw’s “A Man
of Destiny,” Wilde’s “Florentine' Tragedy,”
and Arthur H. Adams’s “Doctor Death.”
This is the fourth occasion when the latter
play has been produced in Australia. The
production will be under the supervision of
G. Ivay Souper, who was largely responsible
for the success of the society’s recent pro-
duction.

The return season in Sydney of Jansen,
the Amurkan conjurer, sleight-of-hand ex-
pert and nasal twangist, commenced at the
Palace on Saturday. On his first appear-
ance in the bloated capital, l Jansen was man-
aged by the then Portus and Talbot firm,
and great was the boom thereof. This time
Jansen and his travelling manager, Felix
BleU are attending to the job themselves.
Business since Saturday has not caused any-
thing in the way of a panic at the box
office. It was not to be expected. To come
back on a large, dead boom is mostly as un-
profitable as the stale remains of the cham-
pagne of the night before, drunk in the cold,
dawn-grey, cigar-stained atmosphere of a
boarding-house sitting-room. Nevertheless,
Jansen is an entertaining cuss, quick as a

flash in his deceptions, and providing plenty
of showy illusions. If he would only take
his intonation to a cutler to be ground, this
paper couldn’t see its way to mention a
fault. In addition to gaping open-mouthed
at Jansen, visitors to the theatre will hear
Nelson Story play the xylophone to a stand-
still. He reckons to knock ‘‘Hail Columbia”
out of it every night. Randolph Bedford’s
“Unseen Eye” will come to pass at this
playhouse on the 26th. The reason why it
doesn’t come to pass earlier is that the Eye
has been temporarily borrowed by the Vic-
torian Police Department in the hope that
it may find an odd murderer or two —a
thing which it hasn’t done with its own eye
for so long that the memory of man run-
neth not to the contrary.
With a cash about 100 years younger, in
the aggregate; with a carefully renovated
lot of chorus maidens; and with severe re-
straints placed upon the principals in the
matter of fun-making, “Dorothy” would pro-
vide the patrons of Her Majesty’s Theatre,
Sydney, with a pleasing evening’s entertain-
ment. As things are, the delightful old opera
tends to grow boresome. Anything drearier
than some of the interminable back-talk of
W. S. Percy (Lurcher) and Miss Ghiloni
(Priscilla), it would be hard to conceive.
Sixteen or 17 miles of their stream of wit re-
quire to be lopped off or dammed or damned or
something, and the chestnuts fairly howl for
drastic sub-editing. An essential point which
none of the leading characters, with the ex-
ception of Miss Dorothy Brunton, appear
to have grasped is that they are not partici-
pating in a modern knockabout farce, but
are there to provide, amongst other ' kings',
a more or less rational picture of life in the
eighteenth century.
The familiar numbers were well sung, for
the most part, on Saturday night. Mis«
Florence Young is in excellent voice once
more, and her extraordinarily speedy render-
ing of the “Tally-ho” chorus caused the house
to become delirious with admiration and joy.
Miss Sybil Arundale looked charming as
Lydia, but by her actions she more suggested
someone named (say) Gert. No more ag-
gressively modern maiden ever took the air
on a Manly steamboat. Talleur Andrews
was at his worst for the occasion. Usually
an artistic singer, his effort in “Gueen of My
Heart,” the ballad with which Haydn Coffin
established the vogue of this opera in the
dim past, was absolutely calamitous. Victor
Prince was an impressive figure as the
owner of Chanticleer Hall, and his acting
was several degrees more restrained than it
ordinarily is, and to that extent morn satis-
factory. Miss Dorothy Brunton (Phyllis)
was, as above-mentioned, right well in the pic-
ture, and her song, “The Time has Come,”
went well. The scenery is exquisite all
through. The entire outfit is to be trans-
ferred to the Theatre Royal on Thursday
night next, as Her Majesty’s has been con-
demned to be spring-cleaned from roof to
cellar.

The Adelaide Literary Theatre has given
a brilliant evening of new short plays.
Synge’s “Riders to the Sea” is unrelieved
gloom. The old Irish mother has lost all
her sons by drowning, except one. The body
of the last-but-one has been drifting about
the coast for a week. The last one must
not go out, or he will be lost, too. But go
he does, and drowned he is (in the quickest
time on record), and his body is borne in.
And the mother is drearily content. There is
nothing left to dread, now; and, after all, if
one has a comfortable grave, and a coffin
of fine white boards (produced), what more
can a reasonable person want? This merry
little work was acted capably by everyone,
and finely by Muriel Craigie as the mother.
But the wailing of the neighbors would be
better done “off.” Conducted on the stage,
on Salvation Army lines, it may tempt the
irreverent to giggle. “By Ourselves” is a
pleasant but quite ordinary curtain-raiser.
Presumably it got in because it was from the
German (of Ludwig Fulda). The semi-de-
tached couple, awaiting their guests, dis-
cover gradually that they are really very
fond _of each other, and would be much
happier_ alone. And then no guests come—
the invitations being found reposing in the
pocket of the doddering man-servant —and
the happy pair are left starting to waltz
by themselves, and eat the lobster and
things meant for a crowd. James Anderson
and Stella. Hayes Smith dealt easily with
this light business (the acting, not the sup-
per). The gem of the Literary evening
remained: “Augustus in Search of a
I afffier,” by Harold Chapin, a new Scotch
writer. Scene, a London street that is “up.”
Time, midnight. Persons, a philosophic
watchman in his shelter, a young loafer back
from America, and an incidental policeman.
No. 2 turns out to be “wanted” by No. 3,
but works jiu-jitsu on the bobby and
escapes. Also, he turns out —very gradu-
ally—to be the wandering son of No. 1, who
never suspects it. Finally, the scapegrace
drifts away into the night, and the play ends
on a note of interrogation. The perform-
ance was a triumph for Ray Walsh, as the

The ladies are figuring largely in Ade-
laide’s amusement list. Kirkby Lunn and
Mary Proctor take alternate evenings at
the Exhibition. Both remember to appeal
to the popular understanding, and both get
their reward, and are popular accordingly.
Another fine contralto is Bessie Slaughter,
at the King’s; where are also the dancing
Brennans and the miscellaneously-musical
Corricks. At the Royal, Buckler and Miss
have been acting finely in “Sins of
Society.” Perhaps a little too finely; for,
after all, melodrama it is, and to play it
right at the„h.eads of the “gallery” is the
safest, and easily the most effectual, method.
The programme has now taken a step down
with the plain shocker, “Brought to Ruin.”
Taylor and Arnold are fooling charmingly at
the Tivoli; other effective partnership turns
are Burns and Bentley and Blake and
Granby. Other shows are the Kadina choir
and the Perth City Band, on the way to
compete at Ballarat, and, in connection
with “Manufactures-; Week,” the Govern-
ment is stimulating loyalty by giving free ,
shows of the cinematograph pictures which
are to advertise this State in Europe.
The “Florodora” revival has only three
weeks to put in at Her Majesty’s (Melb.),
so the new co. should carry the old attrac-
tion that far. There is one sparkling nov-
elty in the performance. Melbourne has not
previously seen the jiu-jitsu dance, or acro-
batic poem, which Fred Leslie and Ivv
Schilling introduce as a “Praps” item, and
this is a charming thing in all respects, es-
pecially as regards the lady. Otherwise there
is a considerable lack of power in the co.
to do justice to “Florodora.” Miss Palotta,
who has most of the smart things to say.
breathes the original spirit of the show, but
of the others there is not one who seems to
meet all reasonable requirements except, per-
haps, Leslie Holland. His Cyrus Gilfain is
at least a personality. The music is rather
too much for Miss Browne. The conspicu-
ous fault of Miss Lonnen is that she is apt
to turn her toes in and her elbows out, and
one doesn’t w r ant Gilfain’s daughter to be
so ungraceful. Higginson (as Captain
Somebody) plays the buffoon rather than the
frivolous officah, whilst Frank Greene is
weak in his warbling resources, and terribly
forced in his heroics. Some singers are said
to be “full of affectation.” The word, me-
thinks, contains hardly enough affectation to
fill Greene’s style. It yearns for more.
And the Tweedlepunch of Bertie Wright is
often painful in his labors to present a
humorous figure grotesquely. However, he
is funny enough when he twangs his harp
in the last scene. The six maidens, al-
though handicapped by tight skirts, are more
satisfactory than their clerks, and the rest
of-the chorus is moderately delightful.
At Melbourne Royal the prevailing influ-
ence of horse explains why “The Whip” is
under orders for Saturday. The big stage
is being readied for a broader and deeper
production of the railway train accident than
heretofore, and an unparalleled race for the
Two Thousand is promised by the over-
wrought advt.

The fourth week of Allen Doone, at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, finds that thin hhroth of
a bhoy behaving much the same as before, in
a somewhat different drama, entitled “Molly
Bawn.” Himself and Miss Edna are the
principal exponents of the sintiment of Erin,
and one of his mild ditties is “A Toast to the
Land where the Local Orangemen are Pre-
senting Toy Muskets at Home Rule.” Also
the ingratiative Doon sings of Molly and
Colleen Bawn, and states, in tuneful lan-
guage, that Molly’s Eyes are Irish. Un-
pathriotically considered, the play seems a
poor thing, built for the main purpose of re-
vealing the hero as a meagre ghost of
Robert Emmett at a fancy-dress ball. But
it draws Hibernian-tinted audiences, even as
“Rule Britannia” fetches simple believers in
the bulldog breed, and the orchestra’s render-
ings of “I’m Awfully Glad I’m Irish,” not to
mention “Eily Riley,” “Savourneen Deelisli,”
etc., are thirstily received. Next week will
conclude the successful chapter of Doone
with “A Romance of Ireland.” After which
comes “The Sins of Society.”
“On Our Selection” will turn money from
Melbourne King’s for only two more weeks.
The period of Dad and his remarkable family
was limited by managerial contract to seven
weeks, and the advance booking is advised
to hurry up to avoid disappointment.

Nothing new has been added to Melbourne
Opera House programme this week. The
present carper makes this statement after
having inspected the turn provided by the
Three Keltons, Yankee instrumentalists,
who put in an appearance on Saturday. A
Miss Kelton hammers out a xylophonic ren-
dition of a Liszt rhapsody in creditable style,
but the impressiveness of the performance is
not enhanced by the presence of Mr. Kelton
misconducting with a wild baton from the
orchestra well. The cool manner in which
the lady consistently ignores his quaint an-
tics should convince him that he is an
utterly superfluous father. The trick cy-
cling of Miss Minnie Kaufmann is gone
through with in business-like style, for the
lady ogles not, neither does she simper. The
perfumes of Arabia or “Florodora” are
needed to sweeten the uninteresting voice of
Miss Jessie Stuart; but nothing short of a
i “Ben Hur” miracle could make the acro-
batic turn of the Schenk Brothers more
astonishing than it is. Proprietor Mcln-
tosh is at present putting his Opera House
in order. The upholsterers and decorators
are working hard, and when they have fin-

Melbourne Majestic, burrowing into his-
tory on Saturday, turned up the story of
Pope Boniface VIII., who tired an excom-
municatory Bull at Philip the Fair of
France, and gave worry to other powerful
contemporaries. The picture includes some
ceremonious love-making between a girl and
a Colonna. who toss ineffective kisses to one
another across the battlements of a castle.
The Colonna, who was called Sciarra Scia-
tica, or some such name, is the means to
Boniface’s downfall in the end, and one can’t
help sympathising with the old gentleman,
who really expiated his follies when such
an insignificant-looking person bowled him
out for one run. Kinemacolor items largely
studded the rest of the programme, and fat-
tened the audience’s geography on glimpses
of Niagara Falls, Khartoum and other in-
convenient localities.

A bird’s-eye view of plain desert, colored
soldiers and Mohammedan morals is pro-
vided in “A French Spy,” which sprinted
at Melbourne Olympia last week. The prin-
cipal person in the film is a female with
nice facial effects, and the troubles she goes
through in search of information are har-
rowing. At one stage of her career she is
seized by a potentate with a shabby turban
and a polygamous past, and before she gains
the sanctuary of her husband’s arms, she
makes the most right-minded audience ex-
pect the worst. Attention can be disrespect-
fully directed to another subject, “The Sands
of Dee,” the tale of Mary who thought she
was to marry a little lamb, but discovered
that the lamb had the nature of an octopus.
No more need be said, though it could be
added that many, many women have been
as optimistic as Mary.

Wirths’ Circus, which opened with a blare
of brass band and a blaze of electrics at the
Hippodrome, Melbourne, last Saturday
night, is a somewhat different proposition
from the show which fed the city with mar-
vels 12 months agone. This year there is
not so much of the giddy clown who used to
array himself like some vegetable growth
and arrive at a joke by much circumlocu-
tion. Bucking bronchos and the festive garb
of cowboy Amurka now pervade the place,
and much of Wirths’ programme is mort-
gaged by Art Boden, Buffalo Vernon and
other brave characters who ride mixed
assortments of horse and bad temper, and
lasso any beast in sight. Art Boden and
co. are very good in making a sort of
garden-party show of their life occupation,

Mr. W. H. Ford, the Father of the Stage, enters
upon his 83rd year on next Guy Fawkes. Day (Nov-
ember 5). He was, so to speak, born upon the stage,
his mother and grandmother having been in the front
row at Astley’s, and he, as a child, appeared there
also. He came to Australia in the 40’s of last cen-
tury, and in the 50’s thereof he built the first theatre
at Brisbane, and did the same sort of thing at Ipswich,
Likewise he opened the first theatrical show at Parra-
inatta, in a hall attached to the Red Cow Inn. He
has played with G. V. Brooke, Barry Sullivan, Clar-
ence Holt, and most of the stars of the ’so’s, ’6o’s
and ’7o’s. Also he was a pioneer of the drama with
Clarence Holt at Dunedin, which is a damp place in’
Maoriland, and infested by wild Presbyterians.
The problem of how to guard and secure Satur-
day’s takings is becoming a serious one for the Lon-
don managers. The merry burglar has all Sunday to
burrow his way into the burglar-proof safe. He
succeeeded in doing it at the Garrick when Oscar
Asche was running “Kismet,” and now he has got
clean away with close on £5OO from the Hipno-
drome. The watchman, while making his rounds,
was seized and drugged. When he regained
the full resources of his brilliant intelligence, he
found the safe blown into smithereens by some power-
ful explosive and the bags of money all gone. This
occurred in the most police-patrolled quarter of
London, and within a few yards of a street that is
never empty. Yet nobody heard a sound. Managers
now propose to take the takings to the Zoo, and
leave them in charge of the lions over Sunday.

In the centre of the show;
When Brownlow, Ward and Kenningham

There’s a modern “Florodora,” and Palotta

Chic and clever,
Same as ever,
And as elegantly gowned ;
But the girls are not the daisies of the well-

And the man who fights for Lauri must

The recent royal command variety performance at
London Palace Theatre had a curious sequel. Certain
rev. Wowsers who run churches and chapels in the
vicinity of that theatre wrote to George Rex, ex-
pressing in Chad band-Citm-Stiggms fashion their holy
horror and indignation at learning that the per-
formance had involved a Sunday rehearsal. They
Pecksniffed at the whole business, and their wrath
stood up in Ueeps. George replied that he was
utterly ignorant (although he might easily have
guessed it) that the Monday evening’s performance
has necessitated “preparations on the previous Sun-
day.” He added his own personal belief in the “due
observance of the Sabbath,” and his regret that the
carrying out of the command performance “should
have entailed arrangements which offended public
susceptibilities or give cause for protest.” George
was quite needlessly humble and apologetic to these
kill-joys, who had no right or authority whatever to
speak in the name of the London public. The Sun-
day rehearsal—practically a preliminary performance
of the whole programme of the following night—
was well known to the Londoners in advance,' and
it was attended by a theatre-full of guests. Alfred
Butt, the Palace manager, says Sunday night was the
only one available for the rehearsal, as the performers
were scattered all over the music-halls of the country
on the week nights earning their living.
George Moore, who never seems to have revived his
admiration for Zola, has achieved a success of notori-
ety over his play, “The Apostle,” in which he has
rewritten “The Resurrection,” according to his anti-
Christian bias. George has neither time nor patience
for the story of the Redeemer’s death. Instead, in
order to build a drama with annoying theor.es and a
ferocious climax, he presents Jesus as a type of hysteri-
cal altruist who falls into a cataleptic swoon on the
Cross, and later awakes to “queer” the religious
“pitch” of the Apostle Paul. Paul, according to
the gospel of St. Moore, had gained great power and
influence through preaching the new religion based
on the miracle of the Resurrection; so he perceives
that if it gets abroad that the Lord had not died
on the fatal day, his faith is foundered, and his
calling is lost. Hence results a conflict between
Paul and Jesus, and, after a discussion in'which the
humility of the Saviour is heroically preserved, Paul
gets mad and ends his Master with an axe. Judas
Iscariot and many subsequent rationalists never dealt
with the Saviour as Moore has done, and it seems
superfluous to add that his drama has been banned
by the English censor. Yet, somehow, the concoction
contrives to be produced. Coteries of highbrows,
swellheads, and • aesthetic enthusiasts have managed
to present “’Hie Apostle” both in London and Mew
York and that has given it a sort of intellectual
triumph.
On September 21, Lillah McCarthy, who was out
here with Wilson Barrett, was about to start the
management of the Savoy (London) in conjunction
with her husband, Granville Barker. The Savoy was
built for Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and so long
as G. and S. worked harmoniously together it was a
gold mine for them and their business partner,
D’Oyly Carte. But since G. and S. quarrelled and
separated, nobody has been able to make money in
the Savoy, although a good many have tried. For a
long time past it has been one of London’s derelict
theatres. Lillah is popular and has a numerous fol-
lowing, so she may possibly revive the ancient glory.
She starts with Shakspeare—“The Winter’s Tale”—-
impersonating Hermione. Her hubby says they are
going to play it in the “rhetorical style of Shak-
speare’s own day” ; also, there is to be “no more
scenery than will be necessary for decorative pur-
poses.” Barker says “Shakspeare’s plays were written
to be acted without realistic scenery,” and he be-
lieves in playing the Bard as the Bard played him-
self, and as a latter-day parson might preach St.
Paul as St. Paul preached himself—sandals, personal
uncleanliness and all. There were no intervals be-
tween the acts in Shakspeare’s time, but Lillah and
her proprietor by marriage didn’t intend reverting
to that custom. They decided to “give the bars a
chance.”
The widow of Tom Robertson (the author of
“Caste”) died only the other day, her name* being
Mrs. John Robertson at the time. Robertson passed
out in 1871, but his sister (Mrs. Kendal) and "'the
Bancrofts, whose fortune he made by fitting them
and their theatre with the right sort of plays, are
still alive and flourishing. Mrs. K., in fact, still
plays the part of rival to Ellen Terry. Ellen is
the same age, but rather younger.
“Melb.”: The splendid new building of the Audi-
torium, Collins-street, Melbourne, opposite the Athen-
aeum, bulks hugely, twice as lofty as had been ex-
pected. What the Athenaeum will do, goodness only
knows. This Rip Van Winkly Sleepy Hollow has
only been kept alive by its hall, for entertainments.
The reading room is a resort of somnolent, mossy
fogies, of the class of Strulbugs, met with by Gulli-
ver. The frowsy library ought to be smoked out. The
institution is up to the level of the year eighteen
hundred and fast asleep. Garnet Walch gave it a
galvanic shock in the generation before last. The
voice of the sluggard was heard to complain; “Woke
too soon and must slumber again.”

Anstruther swears his star will rise.
His frown is something grim to see,
He has a pair of piercing eyes,
As black as ink, of giant size,
The which he rolls portentously.
His heavy villains win respect.
lago is his strongest part.
His work for weeks you might inspect,
And yet his secret not detect—
The eyebrow’s influence in Art.
Where others rage with strident rows
And gestures fervent and sublime,
He works the wool upon his brows,
And sin approves or virtue cows—
The eyebrow actor of all time!

Considerable interest was aroused by the reference
to the conference to be held to-morrow on the sub-
ject of the expected early return of Christ.

“0.K.” speaks a great truth :
Melbourne’s champion bag-snatcher—a 16-year-old
boy—arrested last week, owned up to sundry previous
thefts of the same kind which had been duly “re-
ported to the police.” When a Melbourne burglar,
bag-snatcher, or other such person has been several
tithes reported to the police he is apt to get careless
and : fall into the hands of a civilian.
A Melbourne carpenter, who pleaded
guilty and was committed for trial, had the
bad luck to be “potted” last week on the
charge of falsely representing himself as a
victim of the recent railway accident,
whereas he had escaped a nervous shock by
missing the train. A good many false
claims are said to have been lodged by
imaginative non-passengers, and the car-
penter happened to be a suitable subject
for a shocking example to the other pre-
tenders. Perhaps he will also serve as an
inspiration to bona-fide travellers in a
wrecked train the next time an accident
occurs. The uninjured non-passengers who
go for damages are few in comparison with
the unconsciously injured parties who make
no claim at all. Every Melbourne suburb
these times has its sad stories of local resi-
dents who have died, or become otherwise
incapable of working, in consecmence of in-
juries resulting from the Suusnine or Wind-
sor smashes —victims who thought them-
selves fortunate in escaping without the
proverbial scratch, and didn’t apply to the
Railway Department for compensation. The
carpenter aforesaid might plead that he was
merely asking for a little of the money due
to other people.

The Second Coming of Christ will be a
death-blow to the Trades-halls, seemingly.
A Mr. H. B. Denniston, talking to the Ad-
vent Conference in Melbourne last week,
stated his fixed commercial conviction that
the Second Advent is nearly due, because ’ it
had been prophesied that when Anti-Christ
reigned no man would be allowed to buy or
sell unless he had the mark of the Beast.”
And who is the Brute, dear friends? “He
(Mr. Denniston) did not wish to make any
inference about trades unionism, but he had
found from experience how difficult it was
for a man to get employment unless he be-
longed to some union.” So the Advent
may be expected at any moment. When
Christ comes to judge the world the suffer-
ers from Unionism will look around the
universe and exclaim: “What did I tell
you?” As regards the few hundred million
toilers in China and elsewhere who have
never heard of Christianity, and are pro-
foundly ignorant of the Union Beast that
worries poor Denniston, the “signs of the
times” have no visible significance. The
natives of India, for example, are not
troubled by Wages Boards and labels. And
even in Melbourne there is said to be an
Independent Workers’ Union which has no
Beastly connection. Perhaps, after all, the
Employers’ Union is the Beast that lives in
the reign of Anti-Christ. For the satisfac-
tion of the godless the identity of the Ani-
mal ought to be definitely located. The
commercial instinct of H. B. Denniston is
not necessarily infallible.

By the Oldest Inhabitant:—
The south-east corner of King and Castlereagh
streets, Sydney,. which the Telegraph has acquired,
and on which it is proposed to build a sky-scraper,
has had a variety of occuoants since it was cleared
of its primeval bush and kangaroos. It was origin-
ally owned by tone Thomas Rose, who had upon it an
inn, a well-known sporting house, named the Rose
and Crown. Rose owned a good deal of the Castle-
reagh-street front, and had a bakery and granary on
it as well as the pub. The first note we have of
this I bomas Rose is as the holder of a license for a
hous' 1 i-i ( 'astlereagh-street, in 1811. At a race
meeting held on Hyde Park in September, 1820, he
was clerk of the course. In 1827 he resigned the
horse job, and was succeeded by William Roberts.
Tn the hotel Rose was succeeded by Edward Sandwell,
m whose house horse entries were made, and the
Moses of the day settled his accounts. Sandwell had
the house up to the
late ’3o's, and he
was, it is believed, the
last landlord. The
corner had various oc-
cupants until the first
50’s, when Weeks Nor-
ton had it as a but-
chery. In the late
’5 o’s the Criterion
Hotel appeared on the
site, the first landlord
—o r ab o u t —being
John Hampton, who
had kept the Metro-
politan in Pitt-street,
the original residence
o f John Hosk in g,
Mayor. Hampton re-
named the new house
the Metropolitan, tie
was succeeded in it
by John Williams,
who was a wine and
spirit merchant at
Parramatta, and, on
Mr. Williams’s jieath
(the widow held the license for a time). Prank
Hutchinson, scribe, succeeded. The place has had
many landlords since Hutchinson’s time, and many
fortunes have been made there.
“Chasuble”: Can anything sink lower
than this? Discussing Dean Stephen’s
praiseworthy motion in the Melbourne
Anglican Synod, for the Church of Eng-
land here to be changed into the Church of
Australia, it was objected that such a pro-
ceeding would be a detriment to the collec-
tion of money in England for the Australian
Church. This abominable rattling of the
begging-box ! It has been practised, with
ghastly persistence, especially for the dio-
ceses of Brisbane, Bendigo and Ballarat.
Golden cities ! Yet they go to England with
the poor mouth, humbly begging for coin to
relieve their wretched poverty. There is no
institution on earth, barring a Christian
church, that is capable of so abasing itself.
THE MATRIMONIAL SNARE.
HE : “ Where shall we sit?"
SHE: "Well, where do you propose!"
HE: "Oh, I don't propose. I only suggest.”
By some abstruse process or arrangement
Chief Justice Madden, of Victoria, always
seems to take either the Probate and
Divorce cases or the country circuit, and
these, especially the divorce cases, give him
quite superfluous opportunities to indulge
his propensity to orate at large, but to no
purpose. The discrepancy and irrelevancy
of his orations lie in the fact that his Honor
seldom, if ever, berates the erring wife, but
comes down, like the leaning tower of Pisa
when it falls, on the peccant husband; also,
in the fact that, as a rule, he hears only one
side of the case, which circumstance makes
his remarks lop-sided, untidy and of no
value whatever. Thus, at Bendigo, early
this month, he was told of the delinquencies
of respondent Gilbert Halflide, who, accord-
ing to his wife, drank, gambled, pawned her
belongings, neglected to provide for her, and
finallv deserted her. Halflide didn’t trouble
to defend the case, so Mr. Madden only got
the wife’s version, and out of the depth of
his ignorance he straightway rounded on
the absent respondent, declared him a back-
ward ornament to the community, and a per-
son who ought to be in gaol, and then gave
the wife her decree. All this was wasted,
because Flalflide is a-wandering somewhere
in the backblocks, and is fairly certain never
to hear of it. The very next case concerned
the misdemeanors of Lily May Matthews,
who, immediately after marriage, began to
neglect her household duties and bust up her
hubby’s earnings in riotous living, deserted
him, and ultimately acquired two children
by strange fathers, in a manner of speaking.
The evidence was just as lop-sided as in the
previous case, and the subsequent wife was
just as much of a bad egg as the previous
husband ; but Madden quite forgot to spread
himself, and merely granted a decree nisi
without remarks. Possibly he had ex-
hausted himself by the earlier outbreak.

Defendant: I want £ 2 ss. a week for tip-dray
carting, or 255. per week for other work.
Mr. Murphy (warmly) : You are a lazy, worthless
vagabond. We purposed giving you three days to
allow of your getting a good cleansing and a bath,
but you can go up for three months for your inso-
lence.
Defendant: Can’t I talk? What wages will you
give me ?
Prisoner was forcibly removed.
Murphy, P.M., might explain what defendant
should have done that would have been
gratifying to the Court. As the matter
stands, Frazer seems to have got three
months hard for giving a straightforward
answer to a plain question. The report
might have been satisfactory had the last
line read: “The magistrate was forcibly re-
moved.”
“Vic.” A vicious old
cat came back a day
or so ago. Keep a
horse-shoe on your
door, and a gun be-
hind it. The gun will
load itself. Later
someone will point it
at someone else in
fun. And then it will
go off. Everything
comes to the gun that
waits. A Mafeking
cannon was presented
to the Ballarat (Vic.)
Mining School. Pro-
phetic professors
warned skylarky stu-
dents not to monkey
with it. The can-
non was triumphantly
dragged along'in Bal-
larat processions, as a
memento of the triumph
of poor little Eng-
land and feeble Aus-
tralia combined over
the Boer Giant. It was
like the Philistines with
the Ark of God. On
the afternoon of Oc-
tober 8, the students
determined to have fun
with the gun. Its bang
would startle all Balla-
rat. So they loaded it
with the noisiest explo-
sives they could make,
including chlorate of
potash. Student
McKenzie rammed
the charge home, at
the muzzle. It went
off prematurely. The
steel ramrod was shot
into a brick wall.
McKenzie’s left hand
was blown off, his
right hand badly shat-
tered, and his right eye blown out. Thus
do the Boer States hit back when they were
supposed to be dead.
In Melbourne, the other day, the Law
made another successful attempt to show
what a complication it can be when it really
tries. At the General Sessions, a man was
accused of robbing another of certain
moneys, including some bank notes. Some
notes were found on the accused, and,
though the prosecutor could not identify
them, he claimed them as his. The accused
said he got them from one Scotland Moses,
in consequence of a little transaction about
a horse. Having heard the prosecutor’s
sworn evidence, and the accused’s unsworn
statement, the jury acquitted the latter,
thereby declaring that he was an innocent
citizen, and that the notes were his. The
Judge, however, had other views. He had
to accept the jury’s verdict as regarded the
man, but the Law allowed him a discretion
as to the disposal of the disputed property—
the notes—so he ordered them to be handed
to the prosecutor, and the accused, whom
the Law had just declared to be innocent of
THE HABITUAL HUSBAND.
BRIDEGROOM-FOR-THE-FOURTH-TIME : “I've
just got married again, old chap.”
THE FRIEND: " Congratulations! But I say,
old man , I wish you would invite me to
one of your weddings some time, will you?”
the robbery, had to yield up his hard cash.
Possibly the Judge knew something; he
would have the defendant’s record before him,
if the defendant had one; or possibly he knew
nothing, and did what he did out of pure
contrariness and cantankerousness; but
whether he knew or not, the position is obvi-
ously absurd. Still, the Law is often
absurd.
THE ELUSIVE RIVER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With the building of a dam the water will he
pumped 800 ft. to Mount Strom, whence it will be
gravitated to Red Hill, overlooking the city site.
Colonel Miller says it is not intended to generate
electricity for motive purposes from the Cotter
River , which would be all right in the case of a fall
of water as it is available at Niagara. A steam plant
to generate electricity is to be installed,, and the
scheme is to add to it, unit by unit, as the demand
for power increases. The primary uses to which the
electric plant will be put are the pumping of the
water into the reservoirs.—Fine example of imagina-
tive writing in Sydney mourning paper.

The outcry against the burial of some-
body’s pet cockatoo in Melbourne General
Cemetery had a humorless spiritual strain
in it. As a matter of fact, the question of
public health was an afterthought, suggested
by the possibility of a sentimental dairyman
wanting to plant a pet cow in the human
bone-yard, and thus raise the average decay
above normal, so to speak. The first objec-
tion was to the burying of pretty cocky in
“consecrated ground,” especially ground
consecrated to Roman Catholics. A priest
denounced the interment as “an insult, not
only to the Catholic people, but to all de-
nominations and persons having beloved
ones buried in the cemetery.” Any sort of
human animal, from an atrocious sinner to
a gibbering idiot, is a fit and proper person
to be put in God’s acre to rot, and the holi-
ness of the property is not impaired, but the
invisible presence of the corpse of a toy ter-
rier or tame rabbit in the next grave is an
insult to the religious scruples of the human
deceased and his surviving relatives!_ Some
dust has no right to mingle itself with con-
secrated ground. One sort of worm is differ-
ent from another, as regards _ cemeteries.
The churches claim a proprietorial interest,
on behalf of the Lord, in the places where
miserable sinners take their long rest, and
though a bishop is a staunch supporter of
private worldly ownership in other real
estate, he will always say of church grounds
and graveyards that “the earth is the Lord’s
and the fulness thereof.”
IMPOSSIBLE TO REPEAT.
FIANCE : “What did your father say when you
told him we were engaged?"
FIANCEE: “I don't know. I had to put my
fingers in my ears."
One of the most thriving industries in
Melbourne of late years is the burgling of
suburban railway stations. The workers,
who appear to have a union, walk into the
station and blow the safe open with ex-
plosives if they can’t open it with a cork-
screw, and take any
money and postage
stamps it may con-
tain. Middle Brigh-
ton was visited last
week. A constable,
going his rounds,
found the safe locked
as usual at 3 a.m.,
but an hour later he
found the door open.
The visitors had
called during hi s
absence.
WHY HE LEFT.
“What! Lost interest in the game already."
“No, but Eve lost everything else."
The most persistent, screamed at, and
generally futile brigand that ever harried
Melbourne was walked to earth last week,
just after he had “violently attacked a lady’s
handbag, containing eighteenpence,” as a
morning paper put it. He was a spectacled
lad of about 16, and he insisted on describ-
ing himself as a laborer, though he seems to
have done nothing lately but start females
screaming by suddenly swooping at them
on his bicycle, and yanking madly at the
travelling wallet wherein every woman keeps
the red stuff she puts on her lips, the white
stuff she puts on her nose, and the pattern
for the stuff she is going to put on her back
the minute she gets the two and eleven-
pence she was promised last Tuesday week.
During his raids, he collected: (1) An old
pair of spectacles; (2) a string of beads;
(6) a handkerchief; (4) two shillings; (5)
a nail cleaner; (6) tickets for a concert in
aid of a widow and a large family. The tickets
proved unsaleable after he had worn out
much good boot leather trying to discover
some musical philanthropists. Besides acquir-
ing litter ot this kind, he was screamed at so
often and so furiously that he is probably
deaf and suffering from jumps. lie is al-
leged to have swooped like a goggled hawk
13 times; and half the time he appears to
have fled in perspiring disorder, with no-
thing to show for his trouble but a shrieking
woman with her hat knocked crooked, and a
bag of lamentable private rubbish clutched
in his hand. No reasoning person
ever suspected women of carrying round
handfuls of cash and securities in their
handbags. Women are primitive beings who
keep all their wealth tied, damned and
screwed on to their persons. The busi-
nesslike outlaw would collect it swiftly by
picking them up and shaking them violently
over an exaggerated handkerchief until
everything of value fell off. Then, by the
time the patient had recovered her breath and
was ready to scream, the operator would be
34 miles away, and busy reckoning up the
dividend. But no brigand could work on
those lines who was liable to be put out
of action by having his spectacles clawed off.
Spectacles are a great handicap in some de-
partments of crime.

The Argus says we have no idle rich in

some of the most idle rich in the world.
Some of them whom it might mention are
too idle to spend anything.
“H.” discourses generally:—
The key to the Eastern question is Russia’s deter-
mination to get Constantinople. And after all, the
Czar, as the first living descendant of the Paleologi,
the final Roman emperors, has the same right to it as
George V. has to the throne of Britain. The in-
tensely valuable posts in the world, such as Con-
stantinople, Gibraltar, Suez Canal and Panama, will
ultimately be neutralised. Shanghai is virtually thus
already. A grievance with
China, but not so acute
as that of Hong
Kong. Luxemburg, a
European rock called
the Inland Gibraltar,
is neutralised and dis-
mantled through the
violent contentions of
France and Germany
for it. The Mosque
of St. Sophia, for-
merly Cathedral of St.
Sophia, Goddess of
Wisdom, Constanti-
nople, is reported to be
falling in. May crash
any day, like the
Venetian Campanile,
and as Winchester Ca-
thedral was near doing
till the recent expendi-
ture of £lOO,OOO upon
it. Does the Mosque
of St. Sophia emblem-
ise Turkey ? Constan-
tinople, though 2000
years old, is young in
its greatness. Finest
property of any city in
the globe, from a long
range view. Statists
acree that in 40 years
Chicago will be more
populous than London.
Constantinople is going
to whip both. For-
merly Byzantium. The
original foundation was
at Chalcedon, oppo-
site, on the wrong side
of the Bosphorus,
where Scutari is now;
therefore Chalcedon
has been a by-word
for mental obliquity.
Constantine’s first mis-
taken idea was to
build on the site of
Troy, Asian side,
southern entrance of
the Dardanelles. This
was from a feeling of
sentiment. Tradition
was that the Dardans,
from the site of Rome,
founded Troy. The
Trojan remnant went
back and founded
Rome.
The Victorian Government inquiry into
the management of the Melbourne Infec-
tious Diseases Hospital was largely con-
cerned with the old question of the differ-
ence between sobriety and inebriety. A
medical gent asked for a definition ot the
term “intoxicated,” but confidently asserted
that a man who has taken only one or two
drinks is not “perfectly sober.” Being re-
quested to state whether a certain person
was sober on a certain night, the medical
authority thought “there was no positive
evidence that he was otherwise than sober.
Also, he described the person’s condition as
“normal,” without explaining whether he
was more normal when he was drunk,. or
when he was sober. This was a fine point.
Some people are normal when they are
clean or bald or shoeless or wearing kilts,
and other people are normal when they are
dirty or hairy or shod or wearing pants.
The normal attitude of a Montenegrin is
that of a man who runs after his enemy,
while a Bengalee’s is that of a man who
runs away from his own shadow. Any-
how, the practice of asking witnesses to
give a positive meaning to a comparative
term is a waste of time. The Spanish pro-
verb says: First the man takes a drink,
then the drink takes a drink, then the drink
takes the man,” but the proverb doesn’t
apply to a Bismarck, on the one hand, or a
seasoned commercial traveller, on the other.
The same quantity of alcohol that sharp-
ens Brown’s wits will excite Jones to fight
a policeman. If a man is drunk when,
under the influence of liquor, he acts as he
never acts “in his sober senses,” it doesn’t
follow that drunkenness in his case means
being the worse for liquor. His disposition,
judgment and capacity for work may be the
better for liquor. An abominably sober per-
sou may sometimes become admirably drunk
or vice versa. The Law, which is not always
a hass, makes inebriety a conditional
offence. The defendant is charged with
being “drunk and disorderly”— i.e., disorderly
because of the booze. Yet the Victorian
Government inquiry into the alleged mis-
management of the Infectious Diseases Hos-
pital started off by taking evidence as to
whether the secretary had seemed to be
“otherwise than sober” on certain dates.
Before attempting to prove that the place
had, or had not, been mismanaged, the
Court looked for one reason why it might
have been mismanaged.
“The Old Soldier”: The valedictory ad-
dress which Gaud Mayor Clarke read to
the Governor-General would seem to have
been fashioned by the Beadle, or some other
illiterate person. It drew special attention
to the “indefensible and disloyal” action of
the Government in taking such an “unprece-
dented step” as that of ejecting the King’s
representative, and it expressed peculiar an-
guish that the horror should have occurred
in Sydney’s “historic Government House.”
Little history has been made in the residence
from which the Denmans have been so
churlishly pushed. About the most thrilling
event the vast pile has known has been a
tea-fight or a hop. But that remark does
not apply to the old building in Bridge-street,
which used to be Government House before
the Education Department went to live
there, and which is now being pulled down
.without protests from any quarter. It saw
the then Sovereign’s representative, Gover-
nor Bligh, seized by his own soldiers, acting
under the orders of their commanding officer,
imprisoned, and finally deported. Some of
the actors in that bit of history were tried
by court-martial for it, and it is a diverting
fact that their descendants are among the
wildest cursers at the N.S.W. Labor Gov-
ernment’s recent move in regard to the
present-day King’s rep. By the way,
Clarke’s insistence on “disloyalty” is a
dreadful mistake from Clarke’s point of
view. There is nothing that monarchs hate
more than to be told that their people are
disloyal. It is an article of faith with
every royality that he is personally popu-
lar, and the well-meaning citizen who
makes statements to the contrary is liable
to get himself disliked, and, in consequence,
to lose the J.P.-ship, or whatever it is he
happens to be pursuing.
* * * *
“Snell” : Here in Melbourne the Churches
are striving their hardest to work up some-
thing of a to-do over the Second Coming of
Christ. We are told that all the portents
point to the imminence of the Advent as pre-
dicted in Scripture. There is great commer-
cial, political and social unrest, man is ex-
ceedingly evil, and devilment is rampant on
the face of the earth. In the course of a not
very long life I have encountered three simi-
lar excitements, and on each occasion the
Church was in low water at the time, and
sadly in need of a spiritual buck-up. The
Church is very like the theatre in its methods
of commanding public attention; when draw-
ing bad houses it stages a sensation. But
the theatre is commercially honest, it delivers
the goods, whereas the Bethel gives its
patrons only great expectations. To get
down to details —what in particular is wrong
with the poor old twopenny world just at
this moment? It is less drunk and less
murderous than it used to be. Even the Un-
speakable Turk dare not, for the sake of
public opinion, flay a Bulgarian general alive
if he captures him in war, and hang his
stuffed skin over the commander’s tent, as
he did with a Venetian general a few cen-
turies ago; and when the Unbelievable Turk
has to reform a little, things are looking up.
The Church itself is looking up. It isn’t
more than a century and a half or two cen-
turies ago that the instructions of an Eng-
lish bishop to his inferior clergy included the
statement that they shouldn’t get drunk too
often at the village alehouse. Nowadays, the
custom of carrying home a blithered clerlj
in holy orders and great personal disorders
is practically extinct. According to the signs,
it isn’t so much the Lord who is coming as
the Devil who is going away.
A MEDICAL STANDPOINT ,
PARSON : “So you liked my sermon relative to
'Sinners and loose livers'? ”
SUFFERER: “Yes, indeed, sir. And I was
only wishin' you'd chuck in a few words
about my floating kidney. Thank you, sir."
BLUE RUIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Captain Sir Francis Vane, Bart., founder of the
Royal Boy Scout movement, has become insolvent.
He attributes his failure to the losses he sustained
through his association with the scout movement.
—Tragic cable item.
The bills slip in beneath the door;
Stout bailiffs sympathise and sweat;
And swiftly up and down the floor
There strides a busted baronet.
Blue ruin blows about the hall,
And ev’ry creditor brings more;
Each time the bells electric call,
Blue paper waits beside the door.
The pictured nobles of his line
Look down with disapproving eyes;
With horses, ladies, cards and wine
They use their lands to jeopardise.
Heroic spenders one and all,
They still resent the fact that he
Should stumble to what they would call
“Ridiculous insolvency.”
Grief broods above the Broomstick Guard,
And sadly sighs the passing breeze;
But never comes the tribal bard
To sing the glory of their knees.
Night falls. The owl of ruin hoots ;
The family spectre has a fit;
The bailiffs sad take off their boots
And wonder how he managed it l

“Jimmie Pannikin” : Was driving recently
between Dampandank and Bulladelah, when I came
upon an unhappy and disconsolate parson person who
seemed to have just recovered from a swoon. He
was sitting on a log holding his head in his hands,
and looking as if he wasn’t quite sure whether he
had been struck by lightning or upset by a kick
from the hind leg of the Day of Judgment. Tender
inquiries elicited the fact that he had called to in-
troduce himself to some neighboring families, and
announced the fact that he intended to hold service
on alternate Sundays. “Oh, don’t come on Sundays,
Mister,” cried the entire population of the district;
“come any other day. Sunday’s our time of rest and
enjoyment.” The innocent remark had upset the
parson.
“Leo Lear”: I’m satisfied, absolutely.
Victoria is no fit country for a white man. Give
me the tropics every time. Of all the cursed places
for wind, perpetual and never-ending, I present the
western coast of Watt’s domain with the whole
baker’s outfit. Took lunch out one day, and on
opening the packet the wind blew the meat out of
the sandwiches. It is no uncommon sight in these
regions to see ploughing done by wind power. A
mast is rigged behind the mould-board, and a bow-
sprit run out on the head-rake. The cocky works
the main sheet and steers the outfit from the stern
of the handles. As cheap motive power I reckon
this out-Willises Willis. In an extra heavy blow the
craft heels over and throws a bow-sod breast high,
while the backbone of the continent lets out his
main sail and sits over hard on his weather handle.
An experienced hand can “ ’bout ship” at the end
of a furrow like the Shamrock in quest of the
America Cup. Sometimes when there is an old-
man gale on the quarter, the land roughs up nasty,
and a dirty kind of mud-wash sends showers of earth
over the decks. On these occasions farmers’ sons go
in front with an oil-can, the contents of which calm
the troubled sea of loam. Still, with all its advan-
tages to the cove on the land, these winds become as
wearisome as King O’Malley. In the North we do
get a blow now and then, but it advertises itself
properly, and gets into the newspapers. In this
locality the eternal struggle to keep on your clothes
compels you to glue on your singlet and run a yale
lock through the top eyehole of your boots.
“Billy T.”: I went to Gollan’s narty at
Pine Ford. It was the anniversary of Miss Annie
Gollan’s birthday, and bright the lights shone o’er
spare women and grave men. The leanness and
gravity of that party staggered me. Are there any
fat bushman beside Lord Richard Nevill? But
that’s not the point. It was about 10 o’clock when
I chipped in. At 12 we had only just warmed up.
On with the dance at one. At two we had supper,
and presently the staid, Puritanical waltz was re-
sumed. Suddenly a large, hairy, angry man arrived
at the front door, a cavity opened among his creep-
ing whiskers, and an 80-ton gun said: “Sarah 1”
“Yes, par.” A young lady stepped from among the
dancers. “Come ’ome!” Then the gun roared again.
“Phil!” “Yes, par.” Phil stepped forth. “Come
’ome!” Then there was a babel of protestation:
“Oh, let ’em stay, Mr. Jeames! Let ’em stay, won’t-
chere? We’re just gettin’ ’appy. Let ’em stay.
’Tain’t time to go to bed yet.” “Go to bed! Time
to go to bed?” roared the big gun. “No, but it’s time
to get up. Come ’ome.” “Oh, par, let’s stay.”
“What,” cried par, with hairy indignation—“what,
would yeh keep the cows waitin’ ?” Sarah and Phil
went “’ome.”

22/8/’l2) of Outbackers round places like Burke-
town and Booraloola and other spots in Queensland
and the Territory who have never seen anything
larger in the way of seething city life
than could be dug up at the nearest town-
ship of two stores, a pub and a post
office. But I’ve known more ’strordinary
cases than that. Met a family once on
a selection near the Manning River
(N.S.W.). They had a horse and some
sort of a cart, and were within an hour’s
drive of a township on the river, where
they could connect with a boat running
direct to Sydney. There were four or
five children, and they had never seen the
sea. The woman had not been into the
township for some years, and none of
them had ever apparently thought of
making a trip to Sydney. The woman
told me that once, years before, she had
half arranged to pay a visit to a married
sister in Newcastle, but “Johnnie
took the measles ’bout then, an’ what wi’
nursin’ ’im an’ that—well we’ve never
thought of it since.” In Maoriland, too,
there are hundreds of families living in
the backblocks within 10 or 20 miles
of the railway, as the crow flies, but
who have never seen the rails, never seen
an engine or train, a steamer or a surf
costume, a motor-bike or a moving pic-
ture, a tram-car or a telephone, a brick
house or a barmaid, a perambulator or
a policeman, or any of the other beauti-
ful and bountiful works of civilisation.
However, they are hardly to blame, for
the condition of their roads or tracks
makes any lengthy trip over them as serious an un-
dertaking as a journey in search of the Pole. Pro-
bably a lot of these people will see an aeroplane
before they see the other things.

“Yalgun”: Can any immigrant Aboliar
account for the loss of staying power on the part of
their brother immigrant, the fox? The performance
he puts up when chased by horsemen is very poor;
in fact, a huntsman mounted on a swift cow could
run him down. On the North Coast (N.S.W.) he
does some damage among slumbering poultry, and
local stockmen frequently pursue him to the death.
The chase only lasts a few minutes. Is the English
fox-hunting business a fraud, or can the red outlaw
really run faster than a clothes-horse or a clothes-
line in the Cold Country?
EXPRESSIVE IRRIGATION ITEM.
“Hot, ain't it?”
“Don't ars! me. The channel of me back is runnin' a banker.”
“Eddyson’’: It’s a difficult thing to stop
a country dance. You can set one going with a one-
lunged accordeon or a sciatic piano, a clay floor and
four couples, but you can’t stop it short of calling out
the artillery. There was a raffle at Long’s, and the
terpsichorean gyrations were set in action at seven in
the evening. An hour later Long’s big black bull,
Tarball, hitherto an amiable brute of a meditative
or archaeological turn of mind, infuriated by the
wailings of Meeghan’s fiddle in combination with the
new red blinds, charged the north corner of the
wattle-and-dab dining-room, and hit a hole through
Long’s humble home that you could back a cab into.
Discovering his error, when once inside the room
among familiar faces, Tarball allowed himself to be
extracted by the tail. It took seven men to do it.
One set of the Lancers was overset and sprained by
the bull rush. The rest resumed its contortions.
Long’s high hall (7ft. 4in.) was lighted by an in-
genious chandelier, designed out of two hoops off the
rain butt, suspended from the ceiling, with five
candles in the circle. These candles dripped copi-
ously, and the dancers were more or less spangled
with white warts, but no one discovered occasion to
enter an objection till the candles reached the paper
that served to tighten them between the hoops. Then
there was a terrifying flare-up, and the ceiling took
fire. Half the roof was burnt off before the fire was
subdued. Then a sieged and blackened contingent
of gladsome hoppers resumed the giddy waltz. At
a quarter past 12 the props and stays under the
western extremity of Long’s dining-room gave
way, and the floor fell in, precipitating five
pairs of happy dancers into the outer dark-
ness, where the dog bit seven of them. The
floor was restored roughly, and on went the
dance, joy being confined to the sound portions of
the tenement. At 22 minutes past one the roof blew
up, a smouldering scrap of hessian having "come in
contact with the tin of blasting-powder Long used
to extract teeth, or stumps, or something, when it
wasn’t hidden out of harm’s way in the ceiling.
Then a storm came, and daylight discovered three
couples dancing under umbrellas in the leaky barn.
They were the only survivors, all the other dancers
being more or less singed, bitten or injured. They
are dancing yet for all I know. I left after the ex-
plosion. To be more accurate, I left with it.

The fundamental gallantry of the Aus-
tralian bushman is loudly asserted by Craig. Craig
had driven a lady and her two daughters from
Caincross to Midhill homestead, and was returning.
At a spot about five miles from the station he heard
a faint voice calling, and, after a search, discovered
James Hughie among the branches of a fallen tree.
Hughie, who had been employed to clear the new
road, had just failed to side step the falling goods
and chattels, and was stricken down. Fortunately
the big timber missed him, but he was pinned by a
limb, and had four broken bones. “I thought it was
all up with me,” said Hughie feebly, when Craig had
made him comfortable in the trap. “But,” pro-
tested the driver, “I passed along here an hour ago,
why didn’t you call then?” I was thinkin’ o’ doin’
it,” answered the wreck, “but was afraid o’ dis-
turbin’ the ladies.”
“Pick”: Brother Binghi’s rare accession
to wealth doesn't always result in wild and wasteful
commissions for “baccy” and rum. At Nowra
(N.S.W.), an ancient nigger identity maintained for
years an attitude of independence by periodically
dropping into town with bits of gold, apparently
hewn from a large nugget. How sizeable the original
block of metal was, no one but the black ever
learned, and the most strenuous efforts, stealthy and
otherwise, to track him to his bank, failed utterly.
When about to finally pass in his boomerang, how-
ever, Binghi gave directions which, after much sub-
sequent searching of hills and scouring of gullies,
led not to the fount of wealth, but to an old bat-
tered axe leaning up against an exhausted-looking
tree. Certain traces on the blade led to the im-
pression that Binghi had used it for years to hew
gold out of his treasury. The treasury wasn’t in
sight, and it never has been. Certain of the ex-
plorers swore they heard a black ghost laughing in
the distance. They said bitterly that Binghi was
the prize nark of Illawarra, and the maddest man of
all threw the axe at the ghost. But when the axe
came flying back, apparently from nowhere, the
searchers said the job wasn’t healthy, and fled for all
they were worth.

SIXTEEN HUNDRED ISLE.
(A shriek from Port Arthur, Tasmania.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I, Harikari, disembowel, like Nogi,
This from my mental entrails.
It concerns Port Arthur. Not his, but Tassy’s,
There is an Isle with Sixteen Hundred buried
Convicts and Officers. The Free Men on the Ridge.
The Convicts are below. A convenience
For Gabriel in the Sorting.
The Warders will fly up.
The Convicts will bob down.
But, stay. Are there no Redeemed Fausts
Amid the Convicts?
No Mephistopheles amid the Gaolers?
No Rufus Dawes? No Captain Frere?
Gabriel will protest, and say, “Pooh, Pooh, Non-
sense !
Such yarding of Sheep and Goats won’t do.”
Last week I crossed Bass Strait
In a cockboat to the Western Coast.
Fancied I’d be bounced like cork,
Battledored and shuttlecocked. But, no,
Providence had an idea
That a Rough-cast Poet was coming.
Of the fat and sentimental order.
Therefore Stage-Managed Port Arthur into calm.
Like that of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner,
A painted ship upon a painted Ocean.
The Sea was smooth as glass,
As the glass mingled with fire before the Throne,
Oil-like, clammy, tallowy ;
Like the Ice for Skating at the Glaciarium.
The sky hazy, oppressive, cloudy,
Just the concomitants for Sixteen Hundred Isle.
Oh, I wish I was a Poet!
You’ve been at Waterloo
(Maybe you’ve been in Gaol),
Or at Wagram, Gettysburg or Bannockburn.
You dreamt at night of Ghosts,
Like the Spectral Wicked Nuns in “Roberto II Di-
avolo,”
Shimmering by moonlight through the Cloisters.
Gong! Demons jump up through traps
And drag them shrieking down
AVith poufs of red fire.
Like Mephisto saying, “Hither with Mel”
I dreamt of Sixteen Hundred Isle.
The bones, rattled together, were clothed with
sinews, like Ezekiel’s Army of the Vision.
“The wicked cease from troubling, and the weary
are at rest.
The Prisoners rest together. They hear not the voice
of the Oppressor.
AA r herefore is light given to him that is in misery,
And life unto the bitter in soul?
AVhich long for death, but it cometh not,
And dig for it more than for hid treasures.
AA'hich rejoice exceedingly and are glad
When they can find the grave.”

“George Street”: Will someone move in
the Sydney City Council to have the statue of Cap-
tain Cook, in Hyde Park, taken down ? Cook doesn’t
deserve his honors, and Laurence Hargrave knows
who ought to be standing on the pedestal in his
place. Various Spanish and Portuguese voyagers
have from time to time been credited with having
placed the first boot on Australia, but Hargrave holds
that the earliest white arrivals were the crew of the
Santa Yzabel, who, after losing or being lost by
Mendana in 1595, came on to Sydney and stayed in
the port for some years. The solid reason for their
claim is a slab of rock with marks which look like
the arms of the Santa Yzabel engraved on it. Hargrave
has elaborated the theory that at the very time when
Bill Shakspeare was writing “The Taming of the
Shrew” and “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” Spanish
sailors were busy making weird drawings of kan-
garoos, devils, sharks, archangels and other local
fauna about the shores of Sydney harbor. Everybody
has been willing to regard these rock-cuts as speci-
mens of blackfellow art, but Hargrave has found the
cross-and-circle emblem of Spanish conquest, and
something which looks sufficiently like a heart, anchor
and sword woven into a kind of monogram. The
Santa Yzabel had the latter device for her sign and
blazon, and the evidence, on the face of it, looks de-
cidedly more convincing than a Freetrade argument.
Some of the carved rocks are supplemented by
masonry, overlaid with cement, and as the black-
fellow didn’t use cement to any extent in his archi-
tecture, the discoverer argues that white men once
built a grid there for hauling their ship ashore.

‘ Tiaki” : Henare, of Maoriland, got many
surprises when he first began to investigate the white
man’s larder. Years ago, when Russell fell to the
invading brown man, a raid was made on everything
which looked edible. Tutange found a bag of lime,
and proceeded to make a round loaf with it, under
the impression that it was flour. The result was as
hard as a marble heart. Rongo knew more about the
white man’s cookery book than Tutange. He had
been in a surveyor’s camp. “You don’t know any-
thing about cooking. You ought to be scraping
spuds with the old ‘kuias.’ Why, you never put any
pekini-paura (baking powder) in it.” Piripi had
sold some land to the pakeha for real money. He
decided to banquet his nephews and grand-children.
He went to the store and purchased numerous articles
by the “indication” process—that is, he pointed to
the article he fancied and passed a piece of money
(any piece) over in payment. When the guests were
assembled, “rourous” of ship biscuits and slabs of
yellow material were placed before each feeder.
“What’s this?” snorted the youngest guest, as he
expectorated a chunk of “washerwoman’s friend”
across the dining-room. “That’s what the pakeha
calls ‘tiihi,’ ” replied Piripi. “Cheese be blanked—
that’s, soap, what the pakehas wash their clothes
with.” “Well, I’ve seen white men eat it, and if
they can eat it I can,” sneered Piripi. ■ Nevertheless,
he admitted, as he wiped the iather from his lips,
that pakehas must have wonderfully strong stomachs!
For the remainder of his days ne was known as
“Piripi kai Hopi” (Philip the soap-eater). A great
dish among the latter Maoris was “rerepi” (lillypi).
This was simply flour and water boiled, with sugar
added to sweeten. At feasts gallons and gallons of
it were poured into canoes, and the guests sat round
and ladled it into their vast interiors. At a Northern
pa, just prior to a feast, a naked youngster, whilst
gambolling around, tripped and sprawled into a
canoe full of the nourishment. Meri Waitai was on
hand, and jerked him out to drain back into the
canoe—-all lamentations and “lillypi.” When he
had thinned off a bit, Meri finished the cleansing and
saved the remainder of the rerepi by licking him
dry. A great national dish of that kind Was too
good to be wasted.

“Billy T.”: I had made ud my mind that
66 per cent, of this talk about Boss Cocky’s appre-
ciation of the gifted milker was badinage, till I
heard from Cliff. Cliff is an artist. He contracted
something Aihat began to look like lung trouble, and
was sent into the gum country to mend his respira-
tory apparatus. He put up with Hogan, of the Hills.
Hogan, of the Hills, was a man with exuberant eye-
brows, who had made affluence out of the expressed
essence of cow. Hogan had two daughters. One
named Susan was just It. The other, named Clara,
had been It, but was now far past it, being much too
buxom for high art appreciation. It took Cliff 3$
days to discover that a fresh heart trouble had ren-
dered the left lung a matter of no consequence.
Susan carried his art outfit around, and helped him
to a finer appreciation of the Australian landscape.
She played “Showpan” to him in the evenings, and
was as slim and neat as a new needle. Clara lum-
bered on the outskirts of the romance, butting in
occasionally when the call of Cow permitted. On
the third Sunday Cliff took Hogan aside, and stated
his case. “Susan!” snorted the fond father. “Now
’n’ why for didn’t yeh be askin’ me fer Clara ?”
Then he took Cliff by the buttonhole in a wheedling
way, and added coaxingly: “Bechune me ’n’ yerself,
Misther Cliff, she kin milk three t’ the other’s wan.”

“Yam”: Never knew the rabbits to go nap
on poison bait so enthusiastically as during the past
autumn in the north-eastern end of Victoria. In the
Mitta Mitta and Corryong districts the perfume of
defunct bunny blots out the scenery. Along the
Mitta it was intolerable when I travelled that way
in February, and along the Cudgewa Creek, near
Corryyong, it pursued me for miles with the ferocity
of a herd of Stinking Fishermen. The bird life, too,
has been depleted by the poison, with the result that
the country is infested with plagues of blowflies to
the serious concern of sheep men. Still, something
has to be done about brother rabbit. From Albury
to Corryong by the Murray, and back by Cravensville
and the Mitta, thousands of acres of rough country
are being abandoned to the beast which has killed out
the kangaroo grass. Occupiers of adjoining land
swear that, when: hard pushed, bunny climbs the net-
ting. They also swear—but, no; I won’t repeat
their remarks concerning the Government’s failure to
comply with the Vermin Destruction Act on State
lands. They’re too awful. '
“Thurla” : During the late drought I was
unmullocking some old abandoned workings, and, hap-
pening to break up a solid-looking clay clod, grazed
with my pick-point a frog that was firmly embedded-
in the dry substance. Evidently the thing, was
waiting for resurrection day, or to : be converted in
the progress of the ages into the curio of a live
frog in a block of stone. The amphibian had puffed
out his body when the mud was soft, probably
through taking a breath deep enough to see him
through his captivity, and when pulled out he was
like a ball of air. I regret to say that he was in no
way grateful for his release, and when I last saw
him he was looking for another tomb in which to
bury his disgust.
Who says the Maori isn’t civilised? He
can drive a motor-car as much over the speed limit
as a pakeha, takes quite kindly to the same kind of
liquids that cheer his whiter brother, and is fast de-
veloping into the aristocrat of the Shickery
Cohen-security. What it meant to be a Nor-
man in England, a descendant of the Pilgrim
Fathers in Massachusetts, or an Englishman
in India, it is very soon going to mean to bo
a full-blooded, fathers-came-over-in-the-first-
canoe Maori. At Carterton there is to be a
great gathering of the clans next March, at
which Brown Brother from the Wellington,
Ilawkes Bay, Gisborne and other North
Island districts will assemble. All these
Brown Brethren propose to place authorita-
tively on record the genea-
logies of all the more im-
portant families whose an-
cestors . came from Hawa-
iki, and they will draw up
in chronological form the
history of Aotea-roa, as
told in the legends which
the tohungas have carried
down orally from genera-
tion to generation. No
one can deny the yalue of
this work, and the great
Maori Stud Book may
stand in future history
beside the Doomsday re-
cord and the genealogical
tables of the Bible.
Happy the brown person
who has his name inscribed therein, but still
happier he who has become a big East
Coast landlord as well as a descendant of
man-eating heroes.
‘The Tramp”: One Joe Hallam, other-
wise unknown to fame, holds the belt as pilot of the
biggest load ever stacked on a waggon. With a
team of 42 bullocks, he recently steered 142 bales of
wool from the Wool-scours to Carrathool (N.S.W.), a
distance of 95 miles. The trip took less than a
week. A photo shows a man holding the telegraph
wire from the top of the load, which looks more
like a cathedral than anything else.
“Curse o’ Moses” : Re that discovery of
Prof. Stefansson of white Eskimos basking in the ice
of Victoria Island at the mouth of the Mackenzie
River. The theory that they are descendants of
persons left behind, lost, or otherwise unaccounted
for by Leif Ericsson about a.d. 1000 makes me feel
hurt and cold and sorrowful and angry. Ericsson
did great business in discovering the useful part of
North America, or Vineland, as he called it, and
the people who pulled ropes and attended to pro-
tective stoush on his expeditions deserve a better
fate. Ericsson got the surname “The Lucky,” on ac-
count of the way in which he got his ships through
dangerous and unchartered seas, and was in high
favor at the Court of King Olaf Tryggvason, of
Norway, when he could spare time to get down to
that somewhat less inhospitable country than the
one where his father lived. Any person who had a
father living in Greenland might be accounted lucky
enough to get to any old place, but the luck doesn't
seem to have held to any extent with his descend-
ants. Columbus came home from the lands of his
discovery in chains, but his fate was a kind one com-
pared with that of an adventurer who actually had
a chance to found New York and Boston and
Chicago and the Meat Trust, and become the father
of Roosevelt and George Washington and the Pil-
grims, and who only succeeded in leaving his children
to battle with rheumatism and a cold in the head
until they became plain white Eskimos, living on
b-lubber and a frosty island without hope, or heart,
or knowledge, or warmth for 900 miserable years.
The degeneration of these hardy Norsemen who
couldn’t track their way out of that prison with all
that time to look about them and consider things,
ought to be instructive to the folk who think the
white man can only flourish in 20 degrees of frost,
varied by an atmosphere of fog of 20-blanket thick-
ness. Had Ericsson struck Northern Australia, he
might have left behind a race of white niggers, but
then, again, he might have left a white man’s empire,
or republic, or community of some sort that would
have had energy enough to get round and do things.
What kind of idiot invented the idea that Hell was
hot, with places like Victoria Island actually doing
more awful business than the poor old Devil ever
thought of in his most sulphurous dreams?
“Bilbax” : Don’t want to damp the en-
thusiasm of those who have the courage to talk
mosquito-extermination, but the job is a big one. I
know something of the country between Gladstone
and Rockhampton, and it will take a lot of cash to
deal with the curse which buzzes there. With every
spring tide the rivers and creeks leave innumerable
pools of salt water on the low-lying lands; and in
The Narrows—the long sea passage between the
islands, and the coast —the same conditions obtain.
These pools are the mosquito-hatcheries, and in some
of the shallowest (which evaporate quickly, thus
crowding their tenants into small space) the larva
are occasionally to be found thick enough to be liter-
ally shovelled out. But most of the pools last long
enough to permit the little cusses to develop to the
active nuisance stage, and as each big tide refills
them, the necessary conditions for breeding are prac-
tically permanent. It would take an army of ex-
terminators to work this bit of coast alone, as their
operations would have to be repeated along the whole
line after each spring tide. It is a disputed question
here whether the skeeter breeds in the running salt
water (tidal rivers and creeks) ; but it is quite un-
likely that he does so. The larvae would be at the
mercy of the fish fry (which, by the way, though
thronging these pools when the tide is over them, are
wise enough never to be left behind). And, if car-
ried out to sea, as they certainly would be, it would
be impossible for the germs of annoyance to safely
cast skin and shake their gauzy wings free on a
rough-water surface. Providence, when fixing the in-
iquity up with its engines of irritation, didn’t intend
it to sing to ships or sting sperm whales to any
extent.

A cheap edition of the grand old vest-
ments wrangle was produced in the Maori-
land Supreme Court recently, when Taia-
whaio Te Tau, a brown bishop of the Brown
Church of the Seventh Rule of Jehovah,
sued a Catholic missionary for £5Ol worth
of alleged libel. The missionary, after see-
ing Taiawhaio officiating in vestments simi-
lar to those of an Anglican bishop, hurried
away full of scorn, and wrote that “it is a
festering disease for persons of no standing
to wear such garments.” Some of the polish
was rubbed off Taiawhaio’s halo by his ad-
mission that, two years before he was made
a bishop, he had been suspended for six
months in connection with the cronk running
of a racehorse. The jury brought in a
verdict for £5, thereby indicating that he
had won the legal handicap, but only by a
short mitre.
THE AUSTRALIAN TIGER.
A party of young men and women at Mummed
yesterday saw a strange animal coming along the
road. When it saw them it leaped a fence, landing
amongst some sheep, which scattered. Its appearance
also seemed to excite the bush birds. The animal
cleared a couple more fences. The party are of the
opinion that it was a tiger.— Daily rag.
Richard Slee, just dead at the age of 71,
came to Sydney in 1852, and a few years
later founded stove works at Woolloomooloo.
At the International Exhibition, in 1579, he
got first prize for one of the implements/on
which the missus wastes the blacklead. The
thing was afterwards placed in Sydney Gov-
ernment House, to assist in administering
Australian food to overseas Greatness.
“H.”: The N.S.W. Upper House has
acquired, in recent nominee Browne, its boss
Tory. Pilcher and Ivater and even Henry
Carey Dangar (who belongs to the old
Silurian strata of politics) look askance at
the new man. He has stolen their thunder
—all their combined thunder —and has
added to it thunder of his own. Browne
is an equity barrister. Which explains
everything—as equity men are chiefly em-
ployed in property matters, winding up
estates or administrations and big law suits
with lots of money in them —suits that con-
tinue sp long as the money holds out.
Mentioned as a remarkable fact that
Donald Melville, of the Vic. House of
Rich Landlords, will soon arrive at his 83rd
birthday. The only remarkable thing about
Donald is the comparative up-to-dateness of
his Toryism. His mind has moved somewhat
with the times, and among his younger
brother proputty-owners he ranks as “a bit
of a radical.” They don’t mean it insult-
ingly, of course. They speak forgivingly,
like a respectable old- lady who says to an
archbishop: “Oh, I fear your Grace is quite
a Socialist.”
“Chasuble”: Somewhat about Grice, of
Melbourne, whose portrait has been hung
under sub-vice-regal auspices in the cathe-
dral chapter house. When Bish. Moor-
house started the absurdly-named Bish. of
Melbourne’s fund for bush missionising,
Grice leaped into the breach with £2OOO a
year. That practically killed the show.
While Grice was raging in the forefront of
the heavenly battle with £2OOO per annum
it was plain that nobody else could get the
limelight for less than £2lOO a year. No-
body wanted to buy a very moderate
amount of lime at the figure, and the ten-
dency was to let Grice be the whole fund
while he lived. So Grice cut down his sub-
scription to £lOOO a year that other adver-
tisers might not be crowded out. The fund
is reasonably dead now. About the richest
old Melbourne commercial firm was Heape
and Grice, afterwards Grice, Sumner and
Co. Their warehouse in Flinders-street is
only just knocked down. The Grice man-
sion is at Mornington, on the bay, near
Schnapper Point, and well in view of Chief
Justice Madden’s place, Y'atala, Frankstou,
named after his father-in-law, Frank Ste-
phen. When King George and Queen Mary
came to Melbourne, in the Ophir, that shin ar-
rived on the Sunday, a day too early. There-
fore it anchored off Mornington. George and
Mary (then called May) remarked on the
similarity of the Grice House, gleaming
white _ through the forest, to Osborne, Isle
of Wight. When Honetoun received them
at Melbourne Government House they re-
marked, “Osborne again!” Indeed it'is a
nalpable imitation. The architect was
Wardell, who designed Melbourne’s St.
Patrick’s and Sydney’s St. Mary’s. '
It was in Manufactures’ Week, when
everybody was supposed to be whooping up
the local product, that Sydney learned that
the new headmaster of the Grammar
School had been appointed. He is a mere
kid from England (at least, he is i-eported
to be well under 30), and lie has : a B.A.
degree, which is humble enough. But the
fellow is English, bless his soul, and that
accounts for everything. Incidentally. Ins
name is Harold Newman Penrose Sloman.
It was Solomon Davidson who wrote in
Ecclesiastics: “Woe unto thee, O land, when
thy king is a child.” And over and over
again the accession of Artaxerxes Feeding-
bottle or Ptolemy Pap has been the begin-
ning of great trouble. But still the other
tendency can be overdone. Ferdinand of
Bulgaria is certainly not very old—he is a
gentle botanist aged 51. But Peter Kara-
georgevitch of Servia is 68; Georgios of
Greece is 07; the Sultan is 68; and the
King of Montenegro is 71. And as princi-
pal lookers-on there are the Austrian Kaiser,
aged 82, and Carol of Rumania, aged 73.
This war will yet be known as “The Scrap
of the Old Kings.”
“P.W.G.” does a scrap of biography:—
Edward Carson, leader of the Ulster insurgents or
loyal. revolutionists, or whatever the people who art:
going to shed the last drop of their blood or mud
may be, is a. rather cheap person, suitably employee!
in making a rather cheap noise. Son of a Dublin
engineer, and educated in his native city, he had
the reputation of being a pushful and assertive
person at Trinity College. Trinity doesn’t like
pushful persons pretty well, but Carson was out
after success, and didn’t worry about its opinion of
him. His chance came when, as a junior at the
■ Bar, he found Balfour’s Coercion Act of 1887 the law
of Ireland. Prior to that the distressful place had
been keeping fairly quiet, through the large confi-
dence wh ch Gladstone’s Home Rule Bill had in-
spired, but the return to coercion was Carson’s har-
vest. lie got the job of Junior Crown Prosecutor,
which abler and more prominent men, though thev
belonged to the same political side, had enthusiasti-
cally turned down. The Coercion Act didn’t act
worth a blighted shamrock. People were sent to
gaol, but came out with stronger opinions than
before, but Carson had got hs o :ll .with the land-
lord party and felt good about it.' “Pretty
Fanny,” as Rosebery called Balfour, got tired
of coercion, and tried other methods, but he didn’t
forget his former tools. The Senior Crown Prose-
cutor was. pitchforked into the job of Chief Justice—
from plain Peter O’Brien he became Lord O’Brien
of Kilfenora, which sounds rather like the Earl of
Doolan. Carson was after bigger things, than his
practice on behalf of landlords, and he passed over
.to England, under the patronage or protection or
umbrella of Balfour. In the prosecution of Oscar
Wilde by the Marquis of Queensberry, on a charge
of criminal libel, it-was the luck of; the second-rate
Wish barrister to; smash up the , erratic genius.
Wilde’s arrest followed, and Carson had made good,
"t the English Bar. The latter’ (Carson, not the
English Bar) got into Parliament as; a member for
Trinity College, made plenty , of money, and attained
the distinction of leader of the Ulster loyal insurrec-
tionists and peaceful murderers. Once the bounce and
assurance which had been his stock in trade almost
failed him. It was when lie was confronted by an
English Judge in the person of the Chairman of the
Evicted Tenants Commission, the late Justice
Mathew. Carson, however, had no occasion to
worry about a trifle more or less of contempt being
shown him. He had gained the success he de-
sired by the methods of his own choice, and has
plenty of scope for the exercise of those methods in
the political sphere. No one takes him or the move-
ment he heads very seriously. The Orange drum is
a noisy instrument, and Edward Carson is a noisy
person, but neither leader nor, fol-
lowing is over-burdened with the
material of which martyrs are made,
although they have any amount of
the material which makes auc-
tioneers.

In some respects it casts a disparagement on the

There is no doubt about it.

Another good Australian to find honor

stupendous- job like that.
A. M. HERTZBERG, OF BRISBANE.
It is not often that a private school-
master, 30 years dead, is remembered to
any practical extent; but J. L. Young, an
Englishman who dwelt in Adelaide from
1850 to 1881, left such an impress on his
scholars’ minds that they have got together
to celebrate his memory. The roll-call of
his private venture in teaching is astonish-
ing. It includes Mortimer Menpes,
painter, C. C. Kingston, Kyflin Thomas,
Sam Jacobs, and a host of other well-known
Adelaide names —Bickford, Burford, Scholl,
Verco, Wigg, Wood, Phillipps, Giles, Bullock,
Finlayson and the rest. It is probable that
a Lorenzo Young scholarship will be founded
at Adelaide University.
Colonel McAlcohol writes :
Re the late W. H. Judkins. I was associated with
him when he was boss dog of the M.L. Drought
Promotion Alliance, and editor, publisher and
printer’s devil of the Voice. The Voice was printed
on a hand press and distributed gratis. Even at
thatfigure it was exciting work getting rid of the
publication. The mildest citizen was liable to be-
come a raging maniac on finding the still, small
Voice on his doorstep. I remember being pursued
by an irate individual of pro-beer
habits and great social tonnage, who
promised murder, larceny, arson and
lese majeste if the offence were re-
peated. When the crime duly even-
tuated, the infuriated individual
threw 14 handsprings and fell on his
thicket of whiskers amidst a herd of
objurgations, exclamations, interjec-
tions and bad language. Privately,
Jud was the gentlest reformer that
ever prophesied a hot hereafter for
the thirsty. Off the platform he
couldn't rant for nuts. When Death,
who stalked him for years, first came
to grips, Jud went into retirement.
Later, he emerged as an auctioneer,
at Masterton. Masterton was then
unregenerate, and booze, football, and
making love to Next Door’s missus
were national pastimes. Jud made
the hit of his career. They reckoned
him the whitest Wowser ever. His
send-off culminated in a colossal jaj? that lasted for
weeks. For all this writer wots, the jag may still
endure.
Ex-Premier Verran, of S.A., says he
doesn’t think much of a Parliamentary can-
didate who needs a chairman to keep order
in his meeting. If a man interrupted him,
he stated he would do his own “chucking
out,” should that be needed. Rut the chuck-
ing out interrupts the speech, and makes
the entertainment rather fragmentary.
It transpires that Minister Beeby “is of
opinion that a considerable area of the
finest reserves in N.S.W. should be thrown
open for selection.” Even when the timber
famine is in sight, this sort of tendency
seems unavoidable. The man who sacri-
fices a forest gets applause to-day—from
the people who get the land. And the man
who plants a forest gets applause (if he
isn t forgotten) 30 or 40 years hence, when
the timber is grown. What use has a
transient politician for applause 30 years
hence ?
THE IMPORTED TEACHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Monday Evening.—Mr. Harold Newman
Penrose Sloman. 8.A., classical and English master
at Radley College, has been appointed headmaster
of the Sydney Grammar School.— Cable.
It was in Manufactures Week,
When everyone could see
The printed patriotic shriek—
“ Support Home Industry!”
Each show of good Australian wools,
Or tweeds, or paints, or pots,
Made patriots of blanlcy fools
And fools of patriots.
For, while they gaped, the industries
They boomed with pen and tongue
Were, often sagging at the knees,
Or often going' bung.
The ladder of high wages leant
Against the - tariff fence,
While foolish . party parrots spent
Their useless eloquence.
The foreign sweaters’ goods poured in.
For, though the fence was low,
Strong gangways waited for Ah Sin
And Dutehy, Bull and Co.
Still round the relics of their trade
Australians mild and meek,
The merits of Australia brayed—
For just one blessed week!
Imported strangers off the boats
Around the windows slid.
They asked: “Does mother get five notes
For each Australian kid?”
But one whose factory was dead,
The peace of all destroyed,
By muttering, “Five pounds a head
For future unemployed!”
Imported bishops save their souls
While home-made curates yell,
And spray with prayer the ancient coals
Of their imported Hell!
Who said, “Support Home Industry?"....
In coat-tails, specs, and spats
Comes one to stuff the ABC
’Neath our imported hats !. .. .
Is there no knowledge in this place
Where education’s free?
Or must we even Squeerses chase
Across the blamed old sea?
The patriot in manner grave
Removed his headgear sleek,
And danced it flat upon the pave
In Manufactures Week.

S. Harper: (11 Quite true that The
Bulletin used to attack that co. perhaps 15 years
ago, and doesn’t do so now. Well, what of it?
Don’t you understand that bad companies sometimes
become good, and wipe off their losses, and cut
down expenses; and that good companies sometimes
become bad. If you were running this page you
would presumably still assure that public that the
Pacific Insurance Cos., now quite dead, is a good
investment, because it looked good in its early days,
and you would warn people off B.N.S.W. shares be-
cause the B.N.S.W. was once a mighty poor concern
with a shabby little balance-sheet expressed in
dollars. (2) Goodwill items are always paper, and
always doubtful until experience proves the contrary.
Sometimes they turn out well and sometimes they
don’t. A great deal depends on the general manage-
ment, and in the case you mention the general man-
agement hasn’t been first-rate. (3) You are very
hard to satisfy. In previous days The Bulletin
spoke with great hostility of both companies. One
completely reformed, and this paper ceased to be
hostile, and you are angry. The other didn’t reform
much, and this paper continued more or less hostile,
and you are mad. Tell us, S. Harper, how we can
satisfy you, and be S. Harp about it, for time is
flying.

The business profits are the best realised for a long
while, yet the humble dividend of 5 p.c. absorbs the
lot, save a mere £124. The profit on sales is mere
written-off capital that happens to be recovered. The
smallness of the earnings is due to the fact that the
society now trades almost whqlly on its own funds.
It has £121,859 of capital and reserves, and it has
the use of a mere £31,500 of : other moneys, includ-
ing deposits (which are very small), mortgages, over-
draft, debentures and unclaimed dividends. So the
position is very strong even if the returns are less
magnificent than they might be.

New South Wales has acquired a fresh
uncle. Wonderful, indeed, is the* search for uncles
on the part of the turncoat or Iscariot Government
which got into office on a pledge to reduce borrow-
ing, and to spend loan cash only; on worlds which
would pay full interest and sinking fund, and then
went on the most unprincipled public jag the State
had ever seen. It appears to lack even that sense
of shame which makes the ordinary political Iscariot
show some signs of a knowledge of his own degrada-
tion. The jag has by this time used up the loan
resources of Australia, and the Ministry has been
breathing appeals through Bull’s keyhole for a trifle
to go on with. A few millions were secured for a
very short time at very long interest. Then, appar-
enly, Bull also dried up, and now N.S.W. has gone,
for the first time, upon the French money market.
The reception, of course, was guarded, for when a
deeply-embarrassed and not very reputable debtor
goes to anew uncle, on the ground that the old
uncles, who know him best, are full up of him, the
new uncle is apt to walk round that debtor several
times, and consider him from all points of the com-
pass. Still Paris has loads of money, and the new
uncle resolved to do business at a price. A
£3,000,000 loan has been floated. It is expected
that, when all the details are known, the interest and
sundries will be something very like 4£ p.c. Con-
sidering the condition of the State’s credit, the
unparalleled growth of both ordinary and loan ex-
penditure, the deficit —also unparalleled—worked up
during the first quarter of the financial year, the
falling away in the net revenue from public works,
the bill for Nielsen’s “expenses” in America, and the
general incapacity, it can hardly be said that
Monsieur Frog, of Paris, has been exorbitant. But
it is very manv years since N.S.W. lias been so
low either in its own financial estimation or in
that of its creditors. As far back as 31 years ago
it borrowed at about £3 16s. lid. per cent., and
gradually its credit improved until in 1898 it actu-
ally floated a loan of £ 1,500,000, which returned
uncle only £2 19s. 9d. per cent, on his investment.
The position has changed lamentably since then, and
the Hakes Progress begins to tell in earnest.
McGowen and co. have quite a heap of loans falling
due shortly, and if the Balkan bonfire blazes up in
earnest the Rake may yet have to pay 5 or even 6
per cent, to keep himself out of the Bankruptcy
Court. The present loan, costly as it looks, was a
lucky fluke. It was rushed through ala qu.et
interval, when Europe thought the Balkan scrap
would be averted after all.
Apropos of Rakes and their progress, the City of
Sydney is also in straits for money, and has floated
two loans —one of £500,000 at about £4 18s. 3d.
per cent., and one of £500.000 which will cost
about 5 p.c. It isn’t a cheerful situation, but chronic
borrowers, in times like these, have to take any old
situat.on that offers itself.
In further pursuance of the subject of Rakes, it
is rumored that Premier Peake, of S.A., will make
a personal pilgrimage to England in a few months,
.to ask Bull how he feels about a trifle of £5,000,000
or so. Peake reckons that works already author-
ised, and works that he expects will shortly be au-
thorised, will require nearly £5.700.000. so the case
is urgent. Considering the lamentable sta,te of
Bull’s own consols, it is practically certain' that
S.A. will have to pay through that which it smells
with if any business is to result.

The storm which blew fiercely in a tea-
cup over the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society,
appears to be pass.ng over, and the waves aren’t
nearly so high as they were. The directors have
emphatically denied that there is any suspicion of
unsoundness, and have demanded an official investi-
gation, and this is to be granted. The Victorian
State Government has thought better of its precipi-
tate scheme for sacking the whole directorate, and
appointing anew board, and things are to be done
in a calmer sort of way. If the investigation refutes
all charges, the Colonial Mutual will be in a better
position than ever. It will be able to deck its head
sky-scraper with a notice in black and white, with
10ft. -high letters, that will frighten the- passing
cab-horse into the middle of next week: “The Only
Office in Australia with a Government Certifi-
cate of Solvency.”

There is also a “bonus reserve,” which has been
steadily growing of late. In 1909 it didn’t exist.
In 1910 it amounted to £235. In 1911 it had
reached up to £538, and June 30 last it stood at
£947. The exact purpose or position of this re-
serve is something of a mystery. Some other figures
are as follows:

Those old-fashioned institutions like the
Commercial Bank of Tasmania, which went in for
heavy investments in British Consols because it was
a respectable, “loyal” sort of thing to do, begin to
be sorry for themselves. The Commercial of Tas-
mania holds £160,000 (paper value) of Consols/
They stood in the balance-sheet a few years ago at
£136,000. They were written down to £132,000
(£4OOO loss); £128,000 (another £4OOO loss);
and £123,200 (a further £4BOO loss). Yet even
: now they stand in the balance-sheet at £77, and on
Tuesday last the wretched things had fallen with a
crash to £72 18s. 9d. So nearly another £7OOO of
good Tasmanian money has gone into the sink.

The amount added to reserve ( £8) isn’t magnificent,
and the reserves are very small. Also, the com-
pany’s debts have grown; at June, 1911, it owed
£140,658 to jnortgagees, bankers and creditors,
whereas at June, 1912, it owed £154,985. And the

THE FOUNDER OF THE FEAST.
[For The Bulletin.]
The New South Wales Government has arranged
through the London and Westminster Bank lor a
loan of £3,000,000 in Paris. This is the first occa-
sion on which any Australian Government, wiien
raising an external loan, has not placed its secu-
rities in London. The step is something in the
nature of a new departure. We borrowed £2,000,000
in London a few months back on twelve months
terms, and shall have to renew that with some more
added early next year ; and it would have been spoil-
ing that market to have placed another loan there
now. London, too, would rather not float a new loan
this side of the New Year, and we have £2,549,350
repayable here on January 7.

Oh, say not the world is cold, hard and restricted—
Unfeeling and coarse, as by writers depicted—-
A place full of jeering and sardonic laughter,
Where each jolly Night has to face the Day after 1
Each dog has his day ; so has each doggie’s master !
Let’s send round the wine—may it circulate faster!
Well here’s happy days,... Who’s that growling?
Please hit him!
He’ll yet need a hair from the doggie that bit him !
Here’s health to that man, be he Premier or pea-
sant, -
Who tries to make everyone happy and pleasant!
And here’s to the scorner of grim, old To-morrow
Who haunts our rose-banquets and blights us with
sorrow!
Fill out the big bowls, and lay into the chicken!
Joy lives in the souls of bold men who say “Dicken!”
When croakers and canny folk utter sad warning
That deep draughts all night mean big cheques in
the morning 1
Away with such spoil-sports! The feast is not
finished^—
Though the number of barrels seems somewhat
diminished—
What a wine 1 What a hue! Like a rich, red car-
buncle !
If To-morrow does come—well, there’s always Old
Uncle!
And if not Old Uncle- —who, p’r’aps wouldn’t lend
us —
We’ll find some kind Uncle, who’s sure to befriend
us!
So round with the bottle, and drink till it’s hollow—
We’re right —and the Devil take those who must
follow!

This co. is probably more investment than trustee
or agency. Profit and loss account shows the earn-
ings this way : Interest, £11,894; rent, £1898;
commission and agency, £83. Its own share capital
is £50,000. Its liabilities on various accounts, but
mainly to depositors, swell up to £192,086. Its
visible reserves are very small; after 26 years they
stand now at only £11,556. And there is no
reason to be suspicious that there is any great quan-
tity of reserves that are not visible. In proportion
to its own funds, the company is thus carrying a
pretty heavy load. Of its resources (capital, re-
serves and borrowed money combined), £183,363 is
out on mortgage, £41,823 is in freeholds and lease-
holds, and the balance is in debentures and sundries.
The sundries include £4197'of a bank balance—a
pretty small amount with which to face, £174,644 of
deposits. Presumably, these .. deposits are all fixed ;
nevertheless, the credit of a concern suclx as this is
liable to be very rudely shaken )at times if the man-
agement stands on its rights and refuses to prepay
even fixed deposits. Fortunately, the trustee part of
the business, as mentioned above, appears to be very
small. There ought not to be any at all. No com-
pany which takes money on deposit and lets it out on
loan should be eligible for this highly important job;
its capital should be wholly available for the protec-
tion of beneficiaries under wills, etc., committed to
its administration. Most countries say so by statute,
but the laws of Maoriland, so far as they govern
public companies, are rotten.

The table shows how the dreary situation was faced
in 1903. Since then the business has been mainly
of the undertaking descrintion. and the funeral of
the old dead horse has been fairly successful. On
sales at the written-down values a profit has usually
been made. This gives a general v,ew of the pro-
, . , :

“Advances to clients” are presumably for the- most
part unpaid balances on properties sold on terms.
The 1904 balance-sheet showed: House property,
£289,136; vacant land, £53.081. These items have
now been reduced to £64,790 and £2780 respect-
ively. Having proceeded thus far with the liquida-
tion, and the prospects of new business being
apparently none too good, the society has resolved
upon the transfer of the whole concern to the Fourth
Victorian Society. “The directors have arranged for
the economical carrying on of the affairs of the
society, technically unaltered, until the whole of the
debentures are paid off.” The terms on wh ! ch the
Fourth Victorian Society takes over the business are:
Sale price of assets somewhere between £160,000 and
£ii 0,000, which, means a net return of 225. (id.
per share. The terms of payment are £40,000
to be paid on September 30, and the balance in three
annual instalments, with interest at 4 p.c. p.a.

Black tin oxide has been recently quoted
at 40s. per unit of metal, in Sydney. At that price
70 p.c. of tin concentrates are worth £l4O per ton.
The buyer who pays a: 140 per ton for a 70 p.c.
sample pays at the rate of £ 200 per ton of metal.
So, if he sells between £220 and £230, there is a
wide margin of £2O or so to cover metal losses,
freight, returning and realisation costs. The metal
market is, of course, highly speculative, and when
prices soar to the skyline that accounts for the big
margin between the figure paid for ore and the value
of the tin contents. In N.S.VV. the output of tin is
remarkably constant. The output for 1909 was 1943
tons; for 1910, 1868 tons; for 1911, 1929 tons. The
statistics bulk the tonnage of black tin and ingots of
metal. Which is absurd, for in a country producing
cheap coal it is obviously of interest to know how
much tin is smelted. Last year the value of the tin pro-
duced was £307,089, and the return would have
been some thousands of pounds higher if the ore had
been smelted within the State. Alluvial tin ore
is very easily smelted, so the export of tin oxide
has nothing to excuse it.
“Quinine” : Melbourne is the Mecca of all
exiled Australian mine managers who drift casually to
the uttermost parts, put up a gallant fight against gin
and malaria, and come home lo goou food and good
health. The latest mining stalwart to come back
is W. H. Sutton, a Bendigo native who went to
Kennedy's school a donkey’s generation ago. Sutton
has been in Joliore, Perak, Borneo, Celebes, Pahang
and Siam, struggling with jungle, battling with
new languages, beating fever and generally carrying
on a Homeric contest with fortune. Pahang and
Trengaun, the new native State annexed by the
Briiisii, or rather the Malay States Government,
Sutton says are nearly undeveloped as to tin. Siam
he ragards as full of tin and incidentally of gold.
The Australian-made bucket dredge is superior to the
Dutch article. Sutton strongly advocates looking
for more Tongkah Harbors in S'am.

There is something of the mule’s kick in
the way in which Chairman Rain handled the North
Nuggetty mine at Daylesford (Vic.). The old yarn
of £4 in divs. in the little show was merely op-
timism. Unfortunately the rich patches in the flat-
make petered out, and brought down the house of
cards. Rain now says there is £15,000 worth of
dividends in sight. In saying that the mining en-
gineer speaks, not the mining chairman. That means
only 10s. a share, but the pill is sugared with the
statement, “The position of the mine, situated as it
is in the centre of the best auriferous zone in the
Daylesford district, is considered to give it, apart
from present workings, a very considerable value.”
In the name of the Prophet, rats! This is almost akin
to the Ivlug pronouncement over what might happen
if the British Broken Hill drove north in the ore
channel. Something may be got. The prospects
would be decidedly more cheering if the Ajax and
the Central and the Nuggetty showed up better at
depth, both in the flat-makes and the vertical. The
in-and-out grade of the quartz is admitted by Rain,
who says the natural conditions prevent the giving
of an orthodox estimate of ore reserves.

Jumbunna, a Victorian coal concern, pos-
sesses a stinking fish party. Like the Outrim
Howitt, of Brother Stamp, it was spoon-fed for years
by the State in the matter of railway freights.
When Mcßride decided that the railways should have
their own colliery, the hand that had been fed was
the first to turn. J. A. Boyd, ex-M.L.A., pilots the
Jumbunna coach, and he is very upset because the
State takes the market in slack coal against his co.
His wail is that predicted profits in the Wonthaggi
venture didn’t materialise. But have any profits
materialised on any Gippsland coal mine as expected ?
Anyway, if the State coal mine had charged Bs. 6d.
to the consumer like the Jumbunna, instead of 6s.
6d. like Wonthaggi, would not the difference repre-
sent the saving to the consumer? This on 215,000
tons means £21,000.

All going well Mount Morgan will aver-
age an output of 800 to 900 tons of copper per
month, and instead of taking less ore from Many
Peaks the tendency is to take more, provided, of
course, that the stuff railed 140 miles to Mount Mor-
gan as a flux can be made to yield from 14 to 2
p.c. copper. Pyritic ore has sometimes a tendency
to become very low-grade in copper. For instance,
Mount Lyell used to mine much better grade pyritic
ore than it does now. Last month (September)
Mount Morgan produced 810 tons of copper, contain-
ing 89570 z. gold from 27,720 tons of ore, and the
revenue, helped by a clean-up of 27930 z. from the
gold reduction works, was £98,638. Revenue for
three months from all sources was £294,598 —-copper,
£152,940; gold, £141,658.

For three months the revenue exceeded working costs
by £5573, which is a shade over £l2 per ton of
copper, but this working profit is reduced by office
expenses, interest, realisation charges, expenditure
on plant, and various other items. The production of
462 tons of fine copper in three months is inadequate
for an over-weighted concern like the Great Fitzroy,
so the co. is prospecting 20 miles from Port Moresby
(Papua), and has engaged a number of men to re-
open the Laloki —a low-grade pyritic formation—
and some other copper shows. There is a good road
right up to the mine, and there is no reason why an
easy smelting proposition, requiring a low pro-
portion of coke, should not be made to pay in Papua.
* * * *
Mount Cuthbert (Q.) is a gamble. It is
practically certain that something will be done to
put the concern on a better financial footing. At the
Mount Cuthbert mine Manager Powell estimates the
reserves at 141,000 tons, containing 12,622 tons of
copper and gold worth £15,000. Allowing for a
90 p.c. extraction there will be 11,368 tons of copper.
At £55 per ton of copper, the ore in sight repre-
sents a value of £625,000. Since this estimate was
made copper has risen £2O per ton. The deepest
level is at 350 ft., where the ore is associated with a
quartz gangue, and the lower-grade stuff would pro-
bably concentrate well. Quartz in the furnace requires a
lot of flux, but the concentration finds it fairly easy
to separate. Mount Cuthbert has some ore developed
ht the Kulkadoon and’ Surprise leases, and recently
a surface prospect (10 p.c.) has been obtained from
the Warwick Castle lode. Cuthbert has nominally
240,000 shares, 80,000 of which are unissued.
* * - » *
A few days since, the Brilliant Deeps at
Charters Towers (Q.), had 6ft of quartz at the end
of No. 5 level, which is now well past the point at
which the new underlie or hauling winze will intersect
the level. In fact, a rise fr6m No. 5 is being started
to hasten the opening of another block of stone for
Stoping. The crushing of 376 tons for £2205 is
said to have disappointed speculators, but the market
has raced rather madly ahead of the 1 development
of reserves, which, on a liberal bagis, don’t exceed
30,000 tons.
Brilliant P.C. shares have been traded in
to a greater extent than any others at Charters
Towers. A trial crushing from the winze and
underlie (below 1956 ft.) resulted in 139 tons re-

In all smithing work high-class iron can be more
safely manipulated at varying temperatures than
steel or ordinary iron. It is for this reason that
Best Yorkshire Farnley Iron is preferred by engi-
neers, where toughness, great strength and close
grain are needed. Whatever the specification, Iron
of the Farnley type does not vary, but is simply the
best that can be produced from what is really
wrought iron. “Farnley” Bars of all sections sup-

For rapid and accurate sizing of samples, the
Hoover Rapid Laboratory Sizer is unsurpassed. An

would, in a very short while, cover the small initial
cost of the machine. The machine can be dressed

turning £463. The reef in the underlie shaft 150 ft.
east of the winze has had a wider make of mineral-
ised quartz, but prospects are generally erratic on
the Day Dawn extension, and shares fell rapidly after
the flutter. The Stockholm mine, which is provid-
ing most of the cash to pay for development work on
the Brilliant P.C. lease, crushed 773 tons for
£3189.

For nine months of the present year
Charters ’lowers (Q.) crushed 106,3 1 4 tons for a
return (from all sources) of £310,177. This com-
parts with £422,504 from 130,005 tons for the first
nine months of 1911. Statistics are not cheerful.
Only one mine (the N. B. t reehold) relieves the
situation with an occasional dividend.
* * * *
Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.), by selling
50,000 new shares at oos., will obtain £120,00U
(less commission), and if the option over another
50,000 shares at 565. matures, there will be a very
large addition to capital, enabling this concern (with
400,000 snares) to pursue a bold pol.cy of mine de-
velopment, and possibly of railway construction.
Some ■ enthusiastic backers hint that 10s. a year in
dividends will be a fair thing with copper at £BO ;
but 10s. on 400,000 snares ngures ZOO,OOO, which
is equivalent to £4O per ton on 5000 tons of copper,
the production of which would use up 60,000 tons of
rich 10- p.c. ore. Obviously it is a very optimistic
person who -expects copper to average £BO per ton
for five years, or for Hampden’s profits to average
£4O per ton of copper for five years. The man wno
reckons that dividends will equal £2O per ton of
copper for years ahead will be in less danger of
disappointment. At that rate Hampden would re-
quire to turn out 10,000 tons of copper to pay 10s.
per share. Rather an exacting obligation for a
concern with less than 30,000 tons of copper in
known ore reserves.

The Marmor Mineral Cos., which owns a
copper hole in the ground near Marmor (Q.), the
limestone-flux centre for Mount Morgan, sends small
parcels monthly to the smelters. For September it
sent 39.5571 tons of ore, returning 46.7845dwt. of
gold, 2317.0669dwt. of silver and 5.8730 tons of
copper. The output of decimals is abnormal, and
ought to be worth something extra.

Stanthorpe tin has been registered with
a capital of £12,000 in £lO shares. The public
issue is 500 shares; the vender’s cut is an equal
amount —fully paid, of course —together with a cash
consolation of £3OO. In return for this the co.
acquires 32 acres freehold about three miles from
Stanthorpe (Q.), and certain option rights over 500
acres adjoining, and, if it likes to pay an extra
£BOO, ic can have some more option rights over
another property of 960 acres. Logan Jack con-
tributes his favorable report—not published in time
for the prospectus —-but the following are extracts
from the report of one who appears to be the vendoi :
From 90 acres of wash, averaging 6ft. in depth and 21b.
of stream tin per cubic yard, the recoverable product
of 70 p.c. tin should be worth £103,455, with the
metal at £l9O. Dredging costs for the district are
said to be covered by £lb. of stream tin per cubic
yard. An hydraulic plant, to treat 40 cubic yards ot
wash per hour, is estimated to cost £2500. Work-
ing two shifts, the return = £lßl9 per month of
24 days; average cost = £260, therefore tiet profit
per month = £.1559, or more than enough to pay
for half the dredge in one month. The yearly profit
would thus be about 350 p.c. of the subscribed cash:
life about five years. Avery handsome return,
indeed. - ' _ .
* * * *
Zinc Corporation (Broken Hill) shares
have come into favor because of the steady yield of
lead concentrates from the South Blocks. For three
months to September 30, the output was 9231 tons of
lead concentrates from 35,399 tons of ore, and
21,850 tons of zinc concentrates from 82,899 tons of
tailings. Taking lead at £ls and spelter at £23,
the working profit averages over £12,000 per month.
Last month the estimated profit was £12,847, which
compares with the Amalgamated Zinc Cos. s esti-
mated profit of £13,581. To the Zinc Corporation,
with an average of over 3000 tons of lead concen-
trates per month, the rise in the price of lead is
of much greater importance than the increased price
of spelter, for the deductions and expenses against
lead are far less than the charges against zinc ore.
A' more potent, though a more speculative factor, is
influencing the market, because of a strike t of ore
14ft wide, of good value, in a bore-hole put in from
the South mine’s 970 ft. level. Zinc Corporation has
a total of 898,824 (preference and ordinary) shares,
which rank equally after 20 p.c. has been paid on
the preference issue.

Since 3804 Wyalong (N.S.W.) has pro-
duced gold worth £1,590,547, but the returns have
dwindled. Last year's yield only figures at £27,538,
compared with the record year (1899), which gave
£178,700. Still there is a wide extent of auriferous
country with intervening belts, showing signs of
other metals, particularly tin. C. F. McLean s dis-
covery of a rich reef while on a scrub-cutting con-
tract is a practical proof that prospectors have not
exhausted the possibi li ties of this area. McLean
acquired a 20-acre lease, and named his mine the
Mallee Hen, because that bird lays a. particularly
large egg. To date, the gold from this claim was
worth £13,418, all of which came from 154 tons of
stone. At present the nearest battery is at Wyalong,
byt. it is practically certain that the co. which has
just purchased the Mallee Hen will erect a milling
plant.
* * * *
At Hillgrove (N.S.W.) the Eleanora
mine is going through an extensive course of de-
velopment, and only recently No. 8 level has been
opened from the South shaft, which was sunk from
No. 7 through two reefs lying on each side of a sand-
stone dyke; The reef on the western side had a width
of 2ft. 6in., assaying 12dwt., and that on the
eastern side was 2ft. wide, assaying 15dwt. From
No. 7 level north a winze is down 61ft., and at 56ft.
below the brace a crosscut is in 2,5 ft. A feature. of
the development work is the length of the drive
(939 ft. V north of the South shaft; also the number
of crosscuts in search of parallel reefs. From No. 7
level, at a point 350 ft. north of the South shaft, a
chamber has been cut, and it is intended to sink a
winze on a good make of stone showing gold. The
Eleanora can command a supply of electric power
and has a practically new milling plant, so it has
everything in its favor if the deep levels develop
satisfactorily. Some time since tributors obtained
some good crushings from No. 5 level, and it is quite
on the cards that a good shoot will be picked up
in deeper ground.
* # * *
The new feature at the Junction North
(Broken Hill) is the treatment of zinc middlings
with other products. Last week, to October 5, the
mill produced 387 tons of lead concentrates (56 P- c -)
from 1450 tons of crude ore, 680 tons of slimes, 200
tons purchased ore, and 65 tons middlings. No
assays are given, so it cannot be ascertained how
much metal the big accumulated stock of zinc mid-
dlings contains. The local opinion is that the returns
will yield profits of over £ 2000 per week, or £104,000
a year. That tempts the speculator to take a risk
now that the idea is growing that the reserves will
be increased by developments at the northern end of
No. 12 level. The North co.’s lode at the 1260 ft.
level is 113 ft. wide at No. 8 section, and whatever
may turn up it is pretty certain that large quantities
of ore exist close to the boundary.
* * * *
Bonnie Dundee (N.S.W.) has a singleness
of purpose approaching re'cklessntss. It wants a
smelting plant, and has been trying for a long time
to get it. til the eiiort to persuade someone to lend
the co. offers debentures carrying interest
at 10 p.c. p.a.. repayable in two years, and as an
additional attraction, it promises to give away 10s. in
shares with each pound, of debentures bought. So.
that to raise £SOOO, the co. offers to pay baca
£6OOO in two years, and to make a permanent
present of shares having a face value of £2500.
The mine is 14 miles from the Cobar railway, it
was originally prospected for gold, but passed into
copper at about 230 ft. in depth. Deepest workings
are now 520 ft. An optimistic report states the on-,
reserves to be 25,000 tons of 4 p.c. copper, with a
little gold and silver. The future promises to be as
rocky as the past, but it is a case of now or nevu.
for copper won’t always be at the price it is.
* * * *
An option-hunting deal, found in the
prospectus of the Copeton Consolidated Diamond
and Tin Mines. The co.’s objects are to acquire 56
acres about 18 miles from Jnverell (N.S.W.). l'he
vendors have these under option as follows: (a)
Eight acres for the consideration of 10 shares in tiie
company to be formed and £IOO in cash; (b)
eight acres for five shares and £BO cash; (e) 40
acres for 15 shares and £l5O cash. The co. our-
chasing these rights has a capital of £IB,OOO in
£lO shares. The rights thus involve a cash pay
ment of £330, and a share payment of £3OO (total,
£630) ; they are passed by the vendors on to the
above-mentioned co. for £670 in cash and £SOOO
in shares, and, in return for such generosity, the
co. is to pay the original £630 out of its own
pocket. It has also to give the vendors a six
months’ option over 250 reserved shares, at a pre-
mium of £5. The public is requested to subscribe
for 700 shares.

The Bulletin was justified in its re-
fusal to be put off with the assurance that everything
was all right at the Marvel Loch (W.A.). The
second return from the new plant averaged under
18s. per ton, which is less than one-half of what
shareholders were led to expect. Expenditure proved
costly as predicted (B. 19/9/’l2), and a loss of
£650, or thereabouts, was made on the month’s
operations. Calls are stated to be inevitable, and a
lot of money will have to be spent on development
before the mine can be worked economically and keep
the mill going. Even then its ability to pay divi-
dends is doubtful. Only an unwillingness to come
into holts with the present lop-sided law of libel
prevents references beihg made to the way in which
the interests of this property have been ignored.
* * * *
Golden Poles (W.A.) has been bumped up
a little on a report that anew make of ore has been
exposed outside the old faulting area, and the local
belief that there may be “a future for the old mine.”
Tributors are being given every encouragement to prove
this to be the ease, but the chances of their doing so
are about as hopeless as the dead being brought back
to life. Some day the co. may pay a small dividend
out of cash in hand and money derived from the sale
of its remaining machinery, but that is all that
shareholders are likely to get, and there isn’t any
certainty that they will ever get anything.
* * * *
Coodardy (W.A.) bas got a set back
through the announcement that it was only some
samples of tin that returned 4i p.c., and not the 25
tons treated at the Fingall mill, as previously
alleged. The actual recovery from this parcel is not
disclosed, but it is asserted to be much less than the
figures previously stated.
Great Boulder (W.A.) is still nibbling at
the Great Victoria, but results are proving so erratic,
and averages so low, that the prospect of a deal
being effected looks very doubtful.
* * * *
Sand Queen (W.A.) has kept its end up
by showing 9ft. of high-grade ore at 340 ft., which
is the deepest level yet driven. Should a good
length of payable ore be opened up at this point,
London is to be invited to form a company to take
it over.
*■**■*
Poonah (W.A.), about whose tin de-
posits several tall yarns have been spun, has
been reported on by assistant Government Geo-
logist Woodward. He states (1) that the
gully where the first find was made three years
ago (and this is the only find in, the locality that
has so far proved stanniferous) is practically worked
out; (2) that no lode development worth mention-
ing has been done so far; (3) that the possible
tin-producing area is about four . miles long by l£
miles wide, but that tin has as yet only been dis-
covered at the two extreme ends, and upon the
eastern side. Woodward adds that the ore in the
principal leases being worked is highly kaolinised
pegmatite, varying from a few inches to 3ft. or 4ft.
There are some promising dykes in the district, but
as regards alluvial deposits there is, in his opinion,
little prospect of further discoveries.
* * * *
King of the Hills, formerly Bullfinch
West and South (W.A.), has wound up. It first
tried its ’prentice hand at Bullfinch. Failing there,
it moved to Leonora, and fastened on to the worn-
out King of the Hills. Finding it had drawn another
blank, it went to Greenbushes in search of tin, and
there it experienced another stroke of bad luck.
Now, owing to want of funds and the impossibility
of getting shareholders to find any more, it has
put its shutters up and committed suicide.
* * * *
Last half-year to September 30, Mount
Lvell (Tas.) shipped 3177 tons of blister copper.
This was far below the normal quantity; still, cop-
per is fully £2O higher than it was 12 months
since. Costs have increased, and a decline in grade
from 2.7 p.c. to 2 p.c. is a serious matter.
* * * *
The Primrose (Western Tasmania) has
pulled out of debt, and has now a credit of C3OOO.
Its shipments of lead sulphides to the Tasmanian
Smelting Cos., the contract for which runs to July,
1913, have been profitable. Last week 180 tons of ore
were shipped. At No. 3 leVel there is a zinc lode
20ft. wide, carrying high values. The Rosebery
group of mines, including the Primrose, are anxious
to turn their refractory ore into money. The Tas-
manian Copper, a big concern in 325,000 shares, is
particularly anxious, for it has a contract with the
Tasmanian Metal Extraction Cos.
* * * *
Just when Tasmanian Copper needs new
blood there is every chance of its getting it. Two of
the Clemons, including the Senator, are on a Board
of five. If some of those who have been bumping
the Clemons party in the Hercules can be credited
with charitable intentions, then the move-on clause
will be sought to be applied also to the Tasmanian
Copper. The co. is tied with a debenture issue of
£24,730, and has a suspense account of £20,000
on account of Rosebery ore sales, whatever that may
mean. The dreadful item in the balance-sheet is
“South Australian venture, £69,710, now closed.
This represents the try the co. had to make the old
Blinman mine a profit-earner, while the Rosebery
claim was incubating a process. Then it hit the bi-
sulphite, alias the Tasmanian Metals 'Extraction Cos.,
on the shoulders of which an expenditure of £BO,OOO
is being borne. Bowes Kelly and others behind the
throne seem to have the tired feeling. Hence, no
doubt, the inclusion in the report of complaint over
delay. Now the bi-sulphite crowd is to start up
with its contract as from the first of next month,
and it has to treat the co.'s ore as from January
next. Failing this finalising, out goes the old and
in comes the new. The co.’s ore is as complex as a
well-made cocktail. Gold, silver, lead, zinc, copper,
of such a value as to give the makings of a nice mess
for the metal pot. Whispers go along the ’phone
that. Bowes Kelly has the secret in his pocket, but
he won’t, unbutton until the co. gets rid of its old
Board.

The--great advance made in the construction of In-
ternal Combustion Engines has now been further
demonstrated by the fact of Petrol, Benzine, Kero-
sene and heavy Oil Locomotives being brought into
daily and successful commercial use. The machines
are thoroughly reliable, and are cheaper in very
many instances than steam or electric locomotives.
Messrs. Ironside, Son and Dyckerhoff, of London,
have supplied a great number of their famous “New
Century - ’ locomotives nearly all over the world, and
their machines are even working continuously and
safely in “gassy” coal mines. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne, will be pleased to supply further par-
ticulars. *
“10-2-4” on a theological matter: —
The recent case of the cockatoo which was buried
in consecrated ground, thereby scandalising the
authorities of the Catholic Church to such an extent
that they insisted on the corpse being exhumed and
planted elsewhere, well exemplifies the illogicality
of the truly holy. The point taken was that the pre-
sence of the bird in the cemetery amounted to an
“insult to those persons having loved ones there.”
Yet the Church has never fulminated, so far as I
have heard, against the damnably insulting practice
of keeping live cockatoos in the home. Everywhere
these noisy, useless, insolent, unproductive, loquacious,
jeering, and often revoltingly blasphemous nuisances
are to be encountered right in the middle of the loved
ones, so to speak. Their sphere of annoyance is not
even limited by the confines of the cages in which
they dwell. Their owners frequently unloose them
and allow them to waddle about the house, their
plantigrade feet absurdly out-turned, to the embar-
rassment and exasperation of such of the household s
loved ones as dislike, or are unaccustomed to, live
stock. I was sitting reading in my sister’s drawing-
room the other day, when one of these blastiferous
creatures clawed its way swiftly up my left leg.
Nothing but paralytic terror and the providential
recollection that my assailant had cost a fabulous
sum prevented me from dashing it to the floor, and
exterminating it. * As it was, 1 merely dashed it to
the door. ,
As regards insults, they may be said to be the
live cockatoo’s strong suit. About the only language
this class of pet knows is such as is calculated to
provoke a breach of the peace. And loved ones
have to bow patiently before the wordy blast equally
with duns, process-servers, book-canvassers, life in-
surance agents and persons of that sort. In a ceme-
tery the bird is dead, and hence silent. Nature has
gagged it. It no longer emits curses and four abuse,
it takes up scant room. In the vast wilderness of
mortality, where it is laid, it is of little more ac-
count than a black beetle which has fainted by the
wayside. And presently it decays, and out of its
black heart there grows, perchance, a lovely climbing
rose bush, which, in the course of time, helps to
mitigate the grotesque hideousness of the loved ones
last home. For the first time in its unsavory ex-
istence it is busily employed doing the loved mnes a
good turn. And it is at this beneficent stage that the
mightiest church on earth steps in and roots it up
on a charge of insulting behavior!
There has been something of a rush of
ruined punters of late. One notable ex-
ample last week (he was sentenced to three
years, so he will be a notable example next
week also, and for a good many more weeks)
admitted that he had put £2495 of his em-
ployers’ money on the slow horse with the
big feet, and the coin was all lost. Of
course, that sort of business was done with
the parsons’ bosom friend, the bookmaker,
and not with the tote —an institution which,
unfortunately for itself, has no money of its
own with which to buy up parsons. No-
body gets any joy in making really big bets
on the tote. If you can find a nag that is
going out wholly unbacked, you may do an
exciting gamble on it and take the pool,
unless it is a tote which pays on the second
horse also. Such wins have been made.
And in that sort of case you make a bigger
profit by staking £1 than by staking £IOO.
The more you bet on the tote the more
commission the tote takes from you when
you win, and the more you reduce the
odds. Therefore, the tote is a medium which en-
courages a man to be a happy, casual little
punter—not a huge speculator with a £2495
shortage in his cash-box. But, as already
mentioned, the tote has no reserve fund with
which to buy the friendship of parsons.
The Freetrader, when he is asked if he
wants the benefit of his silly old super-
stition for his -'wn industry, is a most
agile side-stepper. This, for instance, is a
case in point from the Sugar Inquiry:—
Mr. E. W. Knox, general manager of the Colonial
Sugar Refining Company, was called and sworn.
The Chairman: Do you believe in the policy of
Protection, Mr. Knox ? —I am a Freetrader.
Do you make an exception in the case of the sugar
industry?—THE COMPANY CANNOT BE SAID TO
HAVE ANY POLITICAL OPINIONS.
It is the fashion to be a Freetrader because
it is English—like dukes and governors and
“Rule Britannia” and so on. But even
Knox didn’t dare to say that he believed in
the blessings of his own alleged creed as ap-
plied to his own company. He was in the
same position as the Freetrade Herald and
Telegraph, which were the two maddest
rags in Sydney when the 50 per cent. Pro-
tection which they used to enjoy under the
Freetrade postal laws was torn from them.
“Dux”: Wanganui (M.L.) wants a har-
bor, and after years of battling looks like
getting it. A mere trifle, somewhere in the
region of £250,000 is required to turn the
present trickle into deep water, but one
Loan Bill after another was flung out by
disinterested Parliaments. Then Wanganui
devised a master stroke. M’s.P. were in-
vited to “week-end” at the river city. Special
trains brought the party up. Motors and
river steamers rushed them over the sights,
and the picnic was one huge blaze of food
and wine and glory. Teetotal reporters
carfully recorded the speeches of fed and
sometimes blithered politicians, and when
the M’s.P. woke up with sore heads the
next morning the local news-rags; had re-
duced to black and white what read like
promises to enthusiastically support the
next Bill which comes before Parliament !
“John Dishragge”: Our Bulgarian kit-
cheneer (age 47, weight 14st.) is leaving us
after one frenzied week to go to the front.
The night the news came through that the
Montenegrins had crossed the frontier, my
wife informed me behind closed doors that
Phyllis (I think she calls herself that to
disguise her nationality) had objected to
the late hours I kept at the oflice, in conse-
quence of which the washing up was always
delayed, and she was unable to visit her
relations at the oyster saloon, or attend the
local meetings of the Mafia —I forget which.
As I passed the kitchen, I observed the
enraged patriot giving a splendid imitation
of a burst motor-car, with a pound of steak,
the gas stove and the frying-pan. As the
lump of meat topped, and spluttered, and
gave off war-clouds, she sang a wild air of
her native mountains, beating time with
both slippered feet and the hand that wasn’t
holding down the frying-pan. Dinner was
a series of desperate skirmishes, and the
subsequent washing up sounded like a
pitched battle. The wife tearfully estimated
that the losses amounted to at least 2s. 9d.
Phyllis, otherwise Marie Orloff Shufftuski,
is now rapidly mobilising her clothes, and
has engaged a hansom to take her to the
front. I think it is her intention to veil
herself mosquito curtain, enter Tur-
key by the back gate, and start cooking a
pound of steak in the Sultan’s kitchen. If
the fuel does not give out, I am sure the
Sublime Porte will reckon that the Balkans
are going to burst, and that the Department,
of Atrocities will have to be done away if
the fez is to stay in Europe. I dm’t know
what this splendid Balkan blazer has been
doing in our kitchen practising with our
stove; but I wish she had arranged to
murder the gas Collector before she went.
These patriots that dance the sapristi before
the steak and see a camp fire in every gas
jet are too wild and fearless for a quiet
suburb.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, October 14, 1912.
My Dear Arini.—
By this time the Denmans have probably
given orders for outsizes in hats. The up-
rising of the multitude in this town to fare-
well the G.-G. and his tall lady was a blaze
of spontaneous combustion. Curiosity to
witness the spectacle of a Governor-General
chased off the premises just as if he were a
Servian King gnawed at the vitals of many
tired holiday folk. But they stuck nobly to
their end of the same old argument, which is
clothed in the Majesty of the Law, and says.
“Keep back there,” as often as the guinea
fowl in the fable. The fierce desire of a few
score of citizens to catch the 8 p.m. train to
Melbourne on the night of the Expulsion
added to the fun of the great extravaganza.
“Here,, you let me through—l’ve got to
catch the express!” would shout an enraged
person with some of his wardrobe under one
arm, a handbag clutched to his heart, and
a hat (that looked as if it had just emerged
from the under-part of a football scrum)
banged down hard on his head. “Keep bacli
there,” the Law would reply in a deep blue
voice; “I’ve got me instructions.” And then
the citizen with the bashed hat and the em-
bittered eye would swing his bags and crates
and other luggage with an obvious yearning
to bring down the whole lot on the Law’s
head. The only thing that restrained him
was the knowledge that if he did let himself
go he would lose his train. He would also be
fined, and it would be announced in the
papers that a commercial traveller named
Smith had gone mad with excitement at the
loss of the Governor-General. And a mad
commercial traveller gets few orders.
The citizens’ committee consisted largely
of Money with a small residue of Brains.
It did its worst to make the demonstration
to the departing Denmans hang fire like a
wet cracker. That it failed to wall off the
friendly crowd with a regiment of police
was due to the fact that the crowd was too
numerous for the Roberts in charge, and
burst through to add cheers to the Mayor’s
parchment. The Gee-Gee broke away from
his keepers (the Town Hall platform com-
mittee) at five minutes to eight. Before
startled officials had time to collect their in-
structions, a small, hurried figure, bare-
headed and followed by a tall, fair-haired
lady, dashed through the top hat brigade,
got outside the ticket-barrier, and plunged
into the throng. After hurling an agitated
good-bye at the “Mother of Nine,,” “Pater-
familias” (in charge of the crumbs of the
lunch-basket), and other regular contribu-
tors of “Letters to the Editor,” the Denmans
fled back to their State car. The train
jolted out, and the Law melted away into
the by-ways of Eight-hour night.
Belated chatter tears round the long
white wand that Chamberlain Nevill car-
ried at the G.-G.’s last ball in old, dead Gov-
ernment House. It is nart of the official
timber millinery of the billet, but it doesn’t
often take an airing. At the jubilee service
(Westminster Abbey) of that tired, small,
stout lady, Queen Victoria, Nevill had a busy
day keeping .the duchesses in order with a
tall, white stick. They are shown in one of
the numerous engravings of that gorgeous
event, herded together in an alcove opposite
the royal praying-stool. Aphrodite, who is
young and pert, rose out of a foam of white
drapery (at the ball) to inquire whether
the Chamberlain was wearing the real
duchess-beater or a mere substitute. There
was a time, in the long ago of England,
when the wife of a baron, in attend-
ance at Court, sometimes incurred the dis-
pleasure of a Plantagenet king, and the
king sent her to the royal kitchen to be
whipped. And, according to the evidence,
the lady, undressed to the waist and in a
kneeling attitude, was brought to the full
knowledge of the fact that she shouldn’t give
back-talk to the Lord’s Anointed.
Governor Chelmsford’s garden-party, in
race week, had some of the inconveniences of
a resurrection. Those who arrived during
the acute crisis in the fray were wedged
between hundreds of slowly-moving bodies
which packed the red road that coils round
a strip of lawn between the gates of Cran-
brook and the Presence. Two thousand five
hundred is the official poll of those
present. The motor-brigade had to descend
to earth and grit the crumbling gravel under
its heels,, side by side with humble persons
who habitually hang on to tram straps. A
thousand or so must have arrived about the
same moment, hence the resurrection mixture
of the Very Best and Common Clay. The
Clay is usually meek and long-suffering, when
its ribs are fiercely poked by the elbows of
our Nicest People in a garden-party stam-
pede. The progress from gate to vice-regal
Unger the other day, however, reduced some
of the most severely banged-about Earthen-
ware to a large crack in its temper, and a
punished expression in its best hat.
The deadly duty of shaking hands with
two or three thousand lieges ought to be
buried with judicial horsehair and other
curios. The Chelmsfords must have retired
from last week’s combat with sprained fin-
ger-nails and bruised knuckles, for they
smote the palms of those present during the
IS 1 * y °{ *at wi tb unabated
vigor. Aide de Moleyns and Sir Tom Lees
passed along the names of the dressy flock.
and Dumaresq, A.D.C., leaned on his bend-
ing spear, or some such weapon, in the back-
ground, ready to leap to his Lord’s assist-
ance.
The day of the Garden Party was • chiefly
blue and gold, heavily embroidered with dust.
The clothes were mostly of the cobweb
variety, and one or two fashionable damsels
were so transparent in their garments that
they might have posed for the nude without
tearing off much more than a few wisps of
chiffon. Mrs. Scot-Skirving, one of the most
elegant dames in the crush, swished delicate
draperies in orchid tints across the crowded
lawn. Dove grey is still a favorite plumage,
either concentrated in that beguiling shade
as Mrs. Lipscombe donned it, or mere extract
of grey, with a glint of gold under its upper
surface, as the blue-eyed Etta Norris piloted
it through the throng. Mrs. E. W. O’Sulli-
van and Miss McCarthy loomed through a
crush of this season’s millinery, which is
mostly of the floral sky-scraper blend. Vari-
ous high-class parsons added their
gaiters to the crush, including his
Anglican Legs of Sydney, Archbishop
Wright. Politicians chewed the bun
of peace in the ballroom, and quite one
column might be written about the expres-
sion of a perfect lady who had a large and
very wet cup of tea incidentally poured over
her spine.
Two fine old dames showed some of the
youngsters in last week’s calmer moments,
the Importance of Being Youthful at 80 or
so. The veteran Mrs. Curnow stepped
briskly to the garden party, and Mrs. Gil-
hooley, who mothers Mrs. John and Mrs.
Tom Hughes, took her crisp young manners
to the same event.
The Tony Horderns’ dance, under the
domestic shingle (Retford Hall), hit Society
in the right place with a hot supper. The
gorgeous decorations and other expensive
trimmings were noticed by the company, but
tjie Feed of the Season was devoured with
ecstasy and solid silverware. A special
cook-tent, supplied with oil-stoves, turned
out a midnight meal that sent the gourmets
home rejoicing. They departed, wrapped
round a cargo that included the entire dic-
tionary of French sauces and solid helpings
from Homebush.
The Australian Club Ball was smaller this
year, less by about 300 pair of dancing pumps.
Some of the older nobility (Beef and Mutton
dukes) are alleged to have been cut to the
marrow, or some other sensitive portion of
their feelings, last year, by the intrusion of
the herd inside its paling fence preserve.
The Herd, or some of its moneyed hoofs,
pranced gaily enough round the Club’s hired
ballroom a year ago, at one guinea a head.
Tickets for last week’s lily and poppy-
trimmed revel were severely sub-edited in
consequence. The Left-Out had one des-
perate resource. They gnashed their teeth
on the domestic doormat re the ducal family
tree, /-and declared that the dukes inside
didn’t own a tree, or even a sapling. Some
went so far as to declare that they hadn’t a
herb.
Arum lilies have been uncommonly preva-
lent in this season’s decorations, but the
Town Hall basement didn’t get very far away
from its original expression as a municipal
cellar at the Club ball, in spite of a gener-
ous helping of these genteel white blooms.
Unshaded lights above the supper tables flung
a merciless glare on the powdered nose, and
Beauty’s eyes sagged in their lids under the
blaze.
The Naval Drakes and Skylarks didn’t
lose much time in getting engaged to our
girls, or praying they might be. Miss Eileen
Buchanan (not one of the wealthy Kil-
larney clan) is on the list of announced
brides-to-be. Mr. Hill, a lieutenant on
H.M.S. Duck’s Husband, is the man.
Chapman (N.S.W.), in the House of
Reps., asked Mr. Thomas, the other day,
whether Australia’s Pie Commissioner was
tripping out this way, before long; and, if
so, why? This letter got a hint from
London a few weeks ago, and mentioned it
in cold print. A rumor that George Reid
had saved up his holidays for a jaunt to
this side, and was arranging to leave
the Banquet and the Fleshpots next
March, may have crossed the States in The
Bulletin and fluttered like a homing
pigeon into Parliament House (Melb.). My
corresnondent appeared to be well informed,
but the best information sometimes has a
hole in its allegedly watertight compart-
ment.
At least three society engagements are in
the air. But as everyone concerned in the
whole triplet would stoutly deny them at
the present moment, for various reasons,
they have to be handled with care. One
rumor twines the name of a fashionable
widower in a true-lover’s knot with a
smartly-apparelled maiden. They’ve been
seen speaking to each other half a dozen
times in public. This, of course, goes a
lonv way to build up a reliable news item.
A fairly definite cackle concerns another
Sydney damsel who plunged into the social
gallop a year or two ago with great beat-
ing of society drums and general uproar of
press notices. Her young man is alleged to
be on the threshold of another naval stripe,
or something of the kind, hence the alleged
halt in the usual “marriage to be arranged”
columns. This formula, by the way, used
to be reserved for Royal orange-blossoms,
which have to be arranged and disarranged
so often for political reasons that the per-
sons most concerned are generally astounded
when things sort themselves out. For
months before the fixing up of the trouble
they seem to hover between the two possi-
bilities of bigamy and perpetual bachelor-
hood.
Chief Postmaster R. B. Morris, of Christ-
church (M.L.), has been swallowing South
Sea Island breezes as a health restorer for
some weeks. He strikes this port on his
way home from the sunbaked isles of the
blue Pacific.
Mining magnate W. J. Ralph, of Huntley
coal seams (M.L.), is a racing enthusiast in
his spare moments. He happened to reach
this gay city for the Randwick fixture.
Rear-Admiral Ross, of Uncle Sam’s Navy,
is coming this way after resting his epaulets
in Auckland (M.L.). Ross has a daughter
with him. He has had 49 years’ service, so
he is now old enough to possess a vote.
The wedding of the Remarkably Rich
young Lebbeus Hordern and his pretty Olga
Monie occurs on October 17. The girl’s
bridal gown is to be a special splendor of
white satin, with a billowy train of Limerick
lace, the like of which doesn’t fall from
shoulder to floor unless the orange blossoms
have a golden lining. The groom’s presents
to the bridesmaids are alleged to be of the
record-breaking species. Clusters of dia-
monds, shooting out blue lights of the very
first water, will reward the assisting maidens
for tripping after the bridal train in the
Cardinal’s Chapel.
The Kenneth Mackays came to town from
their wool patch up Wallendbeen way, for
the Spring Meeting. Their eldest daughter,
a dark-eyed young maiden, cut her first
grown-up waltz at the Denmans’ farewell
dance. A gleam of white satin under the
usual foam of diaphanous draperies, and a
large consignment of lilies of the valley,
helped her flying feet to chase the rose-
trimmed hours.
The pretty Sheila Chisholm, who recently
had her official jump-off into the whirlpool
of race-week frenzies, achieved one of the
coats and skirts of the season, the other
afternoon. Designed in fine white cloth,
the cut of this garment made the ordinary
tailor-built woman look like an apology in
tweed. The skirt was as narrow as last
season’s tubes, but missed the leggy effect of
the. glorified bolster. Demure rows of
white crystal buttons, the size of marbles,
punctuated a perfect seam or two. A stiff
black tulle bow at the throat, and magpie
millinery, completed an outfit that looked
like Paris or Vienna. Controversy as to
the native soil of this creation, dragged forth
the breathless news that it was a local tri-
umph, and grew in George-street, Sydney.
Have you noticed what a rush of Days
bustled along through the last few months?
Mothers’ Day, Wattle ditto, and Bird Day
leap to the public memory, which is so short
that it forgets to keep up Uncle’s Day—a
prevailing epidemic in N.S.W. just now. I
hear, by the way, that we have a new uncle
—in France. The Government got
him because the uncle here, and the uncle
in England, and the uncle at Jerusalem,
and the uncle beneath the three golden
spheres of Lombardy were all worn out.
The feathered tribe had their party on
October 9, when many State School young-
sters took the pledge not to slaughter small
birds on sight, and so on. In the Tech. Col-
lege, in the evening, at a big mus-
ter of juvenile pledgers the young-
sters were mostly branded with tags of
white satin ribbon, to mark their total ab-
stinence from bush egg-lifting. They also
promise not to steal the product of the
ostrich, and the eagle (which builds its
nest out of clothes props), and the condor,
which a South American friend tells me is a
large bird that lives in the Andes and eats
horses and cows.
Scb-'H-inspector Dawson waded through
the official apologies that always open
these by-the-way shows. Lancelot Har-
rison showed some live-looking bird
slides, and sketched the home life of
feathered fry, after lending his aid to
judge the Bird Call competition. This was
the star turn of the evening. Various State
schools sent teams of small boys to make the
noises that came nearest to the notes of
bush birds. Five Dock, with a splendid imi-
tation of a nest and a gum-tree in the dis-
tance, snatched first prize, while a Hurst-
ville team of boy-birds whistled the second
reward into their own keeping. The laugh-
ing jack was profusely imitated. Imita-
tions of the melancholy Wonga pigeon, the
florid mezzo of the magpie, and the harsh
shriek of the crow made the juvenile face
writhe all over and get very red in the
cheeks. The small school comedian distin-
guished himself with a spirited copy of the
wailing “peep-peep-pip” of a chicken that
had lost its ma, and followed it up with Ma
Hen in search of her strayed or cat-eaten
offspring. He deserved to have been highly
recommended as Professor of a barn-door
ehicken-garten, or egg high school.
J. Ramsay was one of the judges of
this bird day. He’s a ferocious young
camera fiend (amateur species), whose en-
thusiasm drags him out of bed at daylight
to chase feathers on the nest or on the
wing. Gulls who are housed in residential
cliffs near this blue-water front are so per-
sistently pursued by Ramsay’s lens that
they can’t, swallow a 6 a.m. snack without
having their lack of table manners published
in the illustrated papers.
The Women’s Club packed up its hairpins
and its fixed resolve to Improve the Race
(eugenics is one of its pet hobbies) and took
up its new quarters in Stanway House the
other week.
The Queen’s Club, which runs to oak
furniture and exclusive note-paper, seethed
with lunch and tea chatter during the race
week frenzy of the frock. Mrs. Arthur
Tower, who climbed down from the family
ranch at Bankstown with two daughters,
is one of this week’s . hostesses. A girls’
Pekoe party is her affair.
Mrs. Francis Anderson and Prof. Mackay
are the pushers who pushed hardest at the
“Playgrounds for Children” movement. The
Sydney Harbor Trust gave the spare patch
of earth at Miller’s Point, which is thrown
open to infants of the Free Kindergarten
to-day (Monday). And as the land was
badly required to build houses upon, the
Trust thereby made the Congestion and
High Rent problem so much the worse, and
added another straw to the load on the
municipal council’s back.
Maggie Quong Tart, a bright youngster
with a' musical career ahead, is off to Leipsic
Conservatorium in a few weeks. She’s a
daughter of the late Sydney citizen, Quong
Tart, who was a Chinaman by birth, and a
Scotchman by conviction, with an ardent
affection for kilts. The girl gives a concert
before leaving this town.
Spencer Clay, who generally moves on
ahead of John McCormack (the man with
the look of dog-like fidelity in his eyes)
was leaving Maoriland for George Wash-
ington’s own country when the last mail
dropped in from the Dominion. He sent a
breezy letter to a friend in this city, and
gummed it up in the usual manner —with a
lick. Then he seems to have floated away
to Dollarland without worrying too much
about the address. The communication
fought its way to this port as follows:
“George-street, Sydney, N.S.W., England.”
Still things might have been worse. , The
address might have been: “George-street,
Perth, in the Northern Fiji-territory of
S.A., Tasmania, near Greece.”
The members’ stand was comfortably full
on the last race-day, and some of Thurs-
day’s garden-party gowns glode across the
sacred grass without a blush from their
owners. An orgy of clothes generally
climbs down gently at the final flutter, and
a repeat frock can be worn, twice in one
week by the. most dressy dame. Mrs. W.
H. Wood (who used to be Miss French
before she became a fascinating widow and
married the M.L.A. who is so consistently
ejected by the Speaker) was one of the
most charming looking persons on the
sacred grass plot. She tucked the black
tulle ruffle (a determined revival) with
satin streamers, round the shoulder blades
of her heavenly blue gown, and put a black
hat on her brow as a climax. Black and
white fluttered through the exclusive pen
of the Expensively Clad. Mrs. Steer Bow-
ker was amongst the first flight in the mag-
pie blend. The John Toohey dame was
also something special in raven garb with
a flick of cream. The Frank Brennans,
Mrs. Tertius Holdsworth, and Mrs. Spark
(clothed in a misty grey gown with the
phantom form of a white lace tunic lurk-
ing underneath) were out for sport, and
tore every minute of joy from the thunder
of the racing hoofs.
Large consignments of the exten-
sively dressed Osborne clan included
that pretty maiden, Kathleen of the
fair braids, who was like a slim grey streak
the other race day. Lawyer Norris was
severely snuff brown in his attire —a color,
one imagines, rather analogous to the heavy
legal tomes that form the daily diet, of the
learned argument brigade. Trafalgar hur-
ried to the front in the Randwick Plate,
and great was the joy thereof.
Randwick-road, at the recent race-meet,
was an affair of rubber-tyred dust and evil-
smelling. petrol. Its old glory of flying hoof
and racing four-in-hand has vanished before
the irritable “honk-honk” of private machine
and hireling taxi. Eight or 10 years ago
every species of horse, from the collar-proud
carriage nag to the ribby “bottle-oh” ani-
mal, dragged its little lot along the high-
road to Bookie. Huge families, including
everything from the baby to grandfather
and the sandwiches and the parrot, trundled
along in ancient gig, low basket phaeton,
or squeaking, out-of-grease cart. The most
sorry-looking eohippus in the procession could
usually flap his tail and catch the germ of
speed for lOmin. or so. As a spectacle, the
horse is passing out. When the last cab-
rank hack has been stuffed for a local
museum, . perhaps the generation which is
now cutting its first teeth will run mechani-
cal hoofs for heavy mechanical stakes, and
the steam horse, and the air horse, and the
electric horse, and the submarine horse,
and the subterranean horse, and the impal-
pable horse that is urged on by telepathy
or mental suggestion, also the dead horse
and the horse that was of another color will
fight out the battle among them.
Magenta, a hideous survival of the crude
color that, used to be chiefly dedicated to
glazed calico for the heathen, or worn by
humble blooms of the petunia family, boldly
flaunted its eye-racking shade at Randwick.
Not often, but even once is a sufficient
offence in these days of delicate pastel tones.
A magenta feather waggling on a race hat,
and followed up by a drape in the same
angry color, made the wearer look like the
beginning of a Balkan insurrection.
Yours at the tail of the Horse parade,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 14, 1912.
My Dear Yaerie, —
Last Saturday, the V.A.T.C. began the
annual horse frenzy with the Caulfield
Guineas. The sun blazed fiercely and unex-
pectedly after a cold spell, and hax-dly a
woman had a summer dress ready. The con-
sequence was that the frocking was very
patchy, and any lucky female with a suitably
light costume enjoyed the envy, rage, morti-
fication and hate of hundreds. G.-G.
Denman was clad completely in grey from
the roof of his immense hat to the bandages
round his boots. He seemed to enjoy the
racing, and looked so eager that I am sure
he would have stood on his hat to get a
better view if there had been no danger of
the roof collapsing and precipitating him
into the depths. A flight of aides braved
the dust of the roads in a big, ooen car, and
arrived in a rather frazzled state. The new-
est specimen (the golf-playing one, who
feared he would not be able to get a game in
this remote backyard of the Empire) tipped
a high, white-washed belltopper on the back
of his head, and spent most of the day chew-
ing a lead pencil. Lady Fuller, in creamy
white and a black Gainsborough hat, made
a good foil for Auntie Phipps, who blazed in
red, white and blue. Chamberlain Nevill
wore the neatest thing in grey ties. It went
nicely with his slightly greyed hair, his grey
clothes, and the grey look of the betting
sportsman.
Tall Yera Clarke Landale supported high
cerise feathers like soaring fireworks. The
earliest of the visiting wool men studied
their race-cards closely, and hurried
about as if bent on getting the
fleeces off the books, who, of course,
don’t possess any, being mostly wolves and
bald-headed vultures. The Grey-Egerton
lady was stared at ravenously by the whole
grandstand. She spread a neat mustard-
color dress on the green lawn, and carried a
great paddy-green parasol. The Grey-
Egerton miss looked rather dowdy as viewed
from my private hat-inspecting biplane. A
great purple bow sprawled all over her head,
and seemed inclined to drag its moorings.
The Clarke maiden “Possie” (diminutive
for was the gladdest sight to be
seen. She is very pretty, and she sported a
smart green dress with a jaunty little white
hat secured on her well-groomed head, with
two large-knobbed silver skewers. Mamma
had to call “Come on!” several times from
the depths of the family coupe before the
bright youngster could drag herself away
from her numerous friends.
During a recent golf orgie on the San-
dringham links, a pair of players found two
loitering male figures in the line of smite,
and, in accordance with the usual custom,
howled “Fore!” with great ferocity until
the way was cleared. A little later, they
again found the non-playing strangers just
where they wanted to hit. This time they
yelled so furiously that the strangers leaped
like startled antelopes, and gave every' sign
of having been thoroughly shocked. The
players were about to resume their "ame,
when a dazed and horrified caddie, or ste-
ward, or footman rushed up and broke the
news that the obstructers of play were per-
sons of breathless importance—in fact, one
of them was so important that it might im-
peril the concert of Europe if he was to be
howled at promiscuously. Then the players
tore off their hats, sang “God Save the
King.” gave 14 cheers, and solemnly pro-
mised not to throw clods at him if he got in
the way again.
The habit of living in layers is spreading
rapidly. The hotel in Domain-road, facing
the peaceful and dove-haunted Botanical
Gardens, has been purchased by some squat-
ters, and is to be converted into a pile of
flats, which will have the additional advan-
tage of a liquor license at ground level. The
Camperdown Manifolds are interested in the
project, and will, presumably, be their own
tenants to the extent of a flat or two when
the edifice gets froing.
Mayor Bowley, of Camberwell, gave his
official vassals a surprise the other day by
inviting them all to attend church, r>t 11
o’clock on Sundav, and hear the Word ex-
pounded. The invitations did not menti«r?
the customary Sunday roast and pudding to
follow, nor was there any announcement
that collection-plate coins would be supplied
to guests. An authenticated roll call is not
yet to hand.
One of Victoria’s heiresses is booked for
a period of fairly strict economy, whilst her
business advisers are repairing the financial
damage done by a too generous heart and
hand. The saving life will be lived out of
Australia, or, at least, tried until it has been
got used to. Probably the future will be
made gilt-edged, if not golden, by judicious
management.
Civil war is threatening in a local flat-
tery. A rich matron who leases about three
acres of floor-space has. had her maid al-
lotted a room on another floor, the popula-
tion of which is recoiling in more or less
bogus horror from the menial, while the-
menial herself is recoiling in real honest
rage from neighbors who wash their pet
dogs in the only available bathroom. The
management of the social ant-heap might
get out of the difficulty by installing a
special dog-washing apartment. Then the
menial could be scornfully handed the key
of the original bathroom in token of sole
possession, and all the noble dog-owners
could go off together in a herd with their
animals and take turns with the soap.
Spasms of economy or something seem to
attack the rich at inappropriate moments. A
matron of the gilded classes managed to
avoid paying the modest shilling admission
to the Whernside fete in aid of the Babies’
Home by rustling past the amateur gate-
keeper with the brief remark: “I’m calling
on Mrs. Miller.” Mrs. Miller had adver-
tised for a month or more that her whole
house and household, grounds and time were
dedicate on that date to the Babies’ Home.
But, of course, the caller may not have read
the advertisements. Or, again, she might
not have been able to read, or had got rich
so suddenly that she couldn’t stop to look
up days at home.
The Babies’ Home fdte at Whernside
drew the Best People in carloads. Arch-
bishop Clarke, bland and beautifully serene
in his short frock, Fauntleroy sash and
black puttees, blessed the opening, and im-
mediately departed on foot to the distant
tram car so that the downpour of blessings
would not ruin his lovely costume. Lady
Fuller, with water lilies in her hat, was sol-
emnly conducted to the Maggie Stirling con-
cert in the ballroom. Her Ex., Mrs. Miller
and the Forrest dame occupied three arm-
chairs before the platform. Cold, chaste
lilies stood resuectfully in large bowls
against the gilded oak panelling of the
organ, and some carefully-brushed girls
. sang sentimental songs. Down the terrace,
on a far strip of grass, a band brayed lust-
ily, while croquet balls were knocked about
the sunk laWn at so much a head, or hand.
Refined piracy was practised in every cor-
ner. Mrs. Fairbairn, with a gang of rela-
tions in attendance, served refreshments.
The Forrest dame, Mrs. Ledingham, and
Mrs. Lockyer were also in the catering
business; and Mrs. David S.vme and daugh-
ter-in-law Mrs. Geoff sold cakes. A
McGlashan, ef the Lane softgoods
firm, sold butter eggs and poultry; and
the widow of Henry Butler end Mrs.
McHarg provided baskets (at a price) in
which purchasers might carry the eatables
away. Mrs. Davey and Mrs. Agar Wynne
sold hardware provided by themselves, in-
cluding the washing-day copper tongs in-
vented by Mrs. Wynne’s sister. Clive Fair-
bairn. Stanley Burston and Harry Prell
helped the daintily-attired Tulloch misses
to run a merry-go-round. Mrs. Willie Robb,
with her daughter and the Nyulasy girls,
sold sweets out of a cradle, which implement
had only been discovered after much tele-
phone hunting. One after another the Very
Best mothers murmured over the wire: “So
sorry, but I don’t use one. Baby slept in
the lid of my dress basket, you know.” The
stall people made their sweets into cradle
and baby shapes, and sold dainty domestic
dusting caps made out of cambric handker-
chiefs. The sick president, Mrs. Staugh-
ton, sent her regrets—about the only un-
saleable things received. Mrs. Roystone
Davey, the secretary of the financial skir-
mish, pervaded the scene with enormous
glass buttons on her grey tailor-made. Mrs.
Kirkpatrick, gowned in black, strolled in
the midst of a crowd of pretty young daugh-
ters with red rosettes in their hats. At in-
tervals men dashed up in motors, dashed
round the show dashing money, and then
dashed out and away. Plainly they had
taken solemn oaths to attend and spend a
certain amount of money. I mentally
awarded the prize for fastest time to a stout
man in a perfectly blinding belltopper. He
went round in Bmin. 4545ec., and fell into
his waiting motor like a ruined elephant.
Bachelor medico Nyulasy did his bit
towards the Babies’ Home by broiling all
day in a hot sun at the gate of Whernside,
collecting tickets and side-stepping tips
from the short-sighted rich. Some of them,
during the hurry of departure, hurriedly
ordered him to call their cars. Once
he ran an errand to the house with
a parcel, and some of the brigands who knew
him laid an ambush and captured him.
He had to pay a ransom of half a sovereign'
to get back to the gate, where a stout lady
was clamoring for his instant attendance
and acceptance of a worn shilling. I forget
what he was expected to do for this reward,
but have an idea he was to run behind
her motor and pant like a dog.
Clarke’s Cliveden, now remodelled into a
refuge for flat-dwellers, had a private view
last week, when a flock of visitors wandered
from the ground floor to the breezy roof gar-
den. Tea was subsequently poured in the
lounge, when the guests fed themselves and
exclaimed at the electric bread-cutter, the
electric dun-ejector, the electric bore-stunner
and the wireless haircutting machine. A few
days later the last workman was shooed
off the oak-panelled premises, his footprints
broomed off the carpets, and the John Madden
family took possession of their ground-floor
domain. The splendid oak-panelled staircase
has been left untouched amidst all the altera-
tions. There are also hanging lamps made
of beaten brass, and other impressive fittings
that belong to the solemnly magnificent days
when the family and their retainers partially
inhabited the vast pile. A rush of the
Maryannless wealthy has set in, and the two
sets of electric automatic lifts are hoisting
them continuously to comfort and the sloth
that passes all understanding.
Vera, of the beknighted Clarkes, and hus-
band Landale are now the possessors of a
fashionable summer refuge. They have
bought Derriweit, the Gerald Buckley home
at Macedon, with the surrounding garden
and all the beautiful shrubs whereon the
travelling caterpillar collapses and expands
like a silent concertina.
George Chirnside and his small fair wife
have entrenched themselves in a new house
at South Yarra. They have bought Airlie
and filled it with cheque-book trophies from
foreign parts. The lady of the house is
well supplied with foreign-made clothes for
the racing season.
In the fixing-up of the new flats at Clive-
den, in East Melbourne, the management
wisely called in a woman to assist. Miss
Joan Dow was the adviser in the selection
of furnishings, Mass, china, etc. —etcetera
being a large iterq. Only expensive people
need apply for house room at Cliveden, for
the number of tenants is limited to 47.
The widow Staughton, who lately suffered
an attack of pneumonia, is recuperating
amongst the wattles at Gisborne.
Cedric, the good-looking elder son of
squatter John Campbell, drops out of the
list of Toorak dancing men this Cup season.
He is hurrying off to London with a pretty
sister on his arm. on a biz-c#m-pleasure trip.
On Sunday last, big Bowes Kelly, of the
Mt. Lyell mine, smiled again after a period
of anxiety. The great metal burrow, lately
alleged to creep and rock like a ship in a
gale, had been acquitted by the two Judges
appointed by the Miners’ Union, and the
heart of Kelly was at peace. And then
came the tragedy of the fire in the North
mine, and the heart of Kelly was not at
peace. By the way, one of the Bowes Kelly
flappers is called Lyell, after father’s pet
mine.
The Alston Wallaces, who have been rus-
ticating at their country place in the Wan-
ganella district (N.S.W.), have hurried
back to their spacious Toorak lodgment for
the coming frivols.
Mrs. Kendrick Brodribb has decided to
cast her eye over the knot-tying of Noel
Brodribb, in London. She and the girls
leave here in December, just in time to
gather a few marriage garments in foreign
parts.
The Lachlan Mackinnons and their , small
fry will board the London-bound Morea,
which leaves towards the end of October.
The dame, who has preserved some of her
Scottish accent during her years of exile,
has a longing to see the heather in bloom
on her native heath, and the heather, having
been duly notified of her desire, will bloom
as before.
Napoleon Boffard, the plump, sentimental
tenor who has carolled numberless love
songs to Melbourne audiences, gives a con-
cert in the Athenaeum, on Friday, October
18. Amongst his helpers are pianist Zeplin,
f the long hair, and baritone Claud Schil-
ling. Yioliniste Neruda-Steele will make her
debut, and Agnes Caples will attend to the
accompaniments.
The Fan Dango stepdaughter, a dimpled
and plump miss just emerged from the flap-
per stage, is waving a farewell to her girl
chums ere departing for England. She hints
darkly at stage aspirations. Mumming is a
dangerous complaint to introduce into a
household. That is to say, the girls are
pretty sure to take it. You seldom hear of
a boy rushing on to the stage because his
father dragged his stepmother off it.
The widow Julie O’Brien, who cast aside
her weeds for musician Ernest Goll, is com-
ing back to _Australia. Goll gave a success-
ful concert in London, and made up his mind
to stay in the foggy city; but the small
O’Brien baby had other plans. The young-
ster travelled With grandma in the honeymoon
train, and howled and wept for Australia
when grandma returned. Mrs. Goll could
neither have England deafened nor do with-
out her child ; so she stilled the loud protests
by starting for home, and hubby has to fol-
low.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Miss Martha Bruggeman has been singing at the
Queen’s Hall “proms” (London), and the critics
have aimed no hr cks. On the contrary, in fact. Sir
Henry Wood and Botihy are jointly guilty of the
musical side of her. Australians roiled up in force,
and Ada Crossley, the Nitschkes, Daisy Kennedy and
“La Serena” Kleinschmidt were amongst those who
laid or flung vegetable tributes at her feet. She ap-
pears in the Bremen Liedertafel in November.
A branch of the Commonwealth Bank is to occur
in the Royal Exchange Building in King William-
street. So far, this structure has failed to fulfil the
promise of its youth. It was planned on an elaborate
scale, but rapidly degenerated into a dreary, stuffy
erection, where dirt and the aroma of stale tobacco
were plentiful and business was dull. Now it is to
be given a new lease of life, and there is a rumor
that in addition to the Fisher Banking Company it
is to house a new tea-room —the said tea-room to be
on an elaborate and artistic scale. Moreover, the
Tivoli, which is hard by, is to be rebuilt at a cost
of £13,000 ; so that a hitherto poverty-stricken sec-
tion of our “main street” will look comparatively
decent. Mr. Mclntosh’s plans are stupendous, and a
new hotel is to rear its head as well as a new Tivoli.
By the way, the deal was consummated on Friday,
September 13. Rickards, who had the truly sailor-
like superstition of the born pro., would have jibbed
hard at so perilous a step. Not so the fearless
Mclnstoush, who dreads neither portents nor pugs.
Talking of Rickards and superstition, he went aloft
on a Friday, the 13th of the month.
At Government House, on Tuesday evening, there
happened a kind of Clerical-ctm-Parliamentary-cam-
Navy (the Psyche is here) reception. Also, a few
mere citizens battled their way in. Lady Bosanquet
wore cream brocade, opening over panels of soft
blue, veiled in lace; and her daughter was in cream
satin, with touches of floral chiffon on the bodice.
The other charmer is away in Sydney, alack ! Mrs.
Chief Justice Way embellished her cream frock with
panels of rose brocade, and Mrs. Duncan was in
orchid-mauve satin, with drapings of beautiful lace.
Mrs. Mayoress Parsons was smart in an artistic blend-
ing of blue and maize color, and Mrs. Duhst {he’s
the member for Wooroora) wore mingled cinnamon
ninon and primrose satin. Mrs. Frank Fisher and
her daughters, Miss Howard, Mrs. J. R. Anderson,
Mrs. and Miss Box, Mrs. Herbert Rvmill and Miss
Dutton Green were amongst the “unofficials” who
prattled to clerics and M’s.P., and assumed a keen
interest in Church and State for the moment. Supper
somewhere about 10 o’clock and cabs half an hour
or so later brought all hands back home at a decently
sober hour. None knows better than our vice-
regalities the danger of turning uncurbed clerics
loose on the town when the hotels are closed and the
spirits of frivolity and lawlessness are abroad.
Members of Parliament, or their wives, are begin-
ning the usual old weep re the increased cost of
living, and member Cherson, of Port Adelaide, has
tabled a notice of motion > demanding an increase of
salaries. The measure will be voted on, I hear, irre-
spective of party—very much irrespective of party, in
fact.
Mrs. Warden (Miss Mabel Fisher) left for Eng-
land by the outgoing mail. Miss Dutton Green sails
next week, and doesn’t know how long she mayn’t
stay. The chances are, if the Labor party doesn’t
mend its ways, she will never come back at all.
The S.A.J.C’s Spring Meeting was entirely suc-
cessful on Saturday and Wednesday. On Derby day
the totalisator receipts were a hundred or so ahead
of those for the previous year. Mr. McFarlane se-
cured both the Morphettville Plate and the Sturt
Handicap, and Koepenick and Luger gave the divi-
dends of the day, £l4 14s. and £l9 6s. The Gov-
ernment House party included Lady Bosanquet, who
veiled her pale blue frock with an overdress of helio-
trope ninon, Miss Bosanquet and Mrs. Row. The
coat and skirt, which is getting to be a monotonous,
if sensible, uniform for races, held its own with most
other women, though Mrs. Tom Barr Smith, Mrs.
Jervois, Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Varley clung to
“frocks.” The first-mentioned was hostess at an after-
noon tea given on the course.
On Wednesday, Steeplechase Day, the Governor
came unaccompanied by either Lady or Miss Bosan-
auet, and saw a good day’s racing. Mrs. Smeaton.
Mrs. Arthur Ardmore, Mrs. Nat Campbell, Miss Fisher
and her cousins, the Misses Culross, Miss Jean Pete
and Mrs. Tennant were among those who watched the
sport. The train accommodation was more vile than
usual—the five-mile iourney being accomplished in an
hour or so, with discomfort, squash and blanky
infinite.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

HOW TO ELECTROLYSE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR
WITHOUT GOING TO AN EXPERT.
Some ladies in this country have latelv heard
from Mme. Tensfeldt, of 120 a Princes Street, Edin-
burgh, Scotland, the well-known expert, that she has
perfected a self-acting apparatus which any lady can
use for herself, in her own room. It will destroy
the roots of every hair. There is not the slightest
possibility of the hair growing anew, and the thing is
quite easily done. It causes no pain and needs no
skill. A lady has only to sit before a mirror in a
good light and select the first hair which she proposes
to eradicate. In about five seconds the hair either
drops out, or can be brushed off by a touch; and it
can never grow again. So with every hair on the
face or arm. Mme. Tensfeldt guarantees satisfaction.
The apparatus costs £5 55., carriage paid, and can be
easily sold second-hand when dope With. Mme. Tens-
feldt will take it back within six months and re-
turn £1 ss. for it if desired.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
The British suffragettes have advanced
two new ideas. One is a hunger strike of
women—all persons who wear skirts are to
leave off eating till they get the vote. The
other is a march of women from Edinburgh
to London. The food-stoppage or empty-
stomach business, if it comes off, is to start
at midnight on December 25, and by JNeW
Year’s Day England is to be covered with
the dead bodies of emaciated females. But
such a large proportion of British women
are accustomed to hunger that they will
take a long time to die, and a lot of them
will last out to the end of January, or even
later. A hunger strike among the poorer
classes in England would be very much like
a strike against Christianity among Turks
or a sheep strike against wool.
Speaking on the Maternity Bill, Dr.
Maloney, M.H.R., said, mysteriously: —
I could sometimes forgive anyone for swearing at
the High Court when he hears of some of its de-
cisions. I had three afternoons before the High
Court, and I wouldn’t trust a Newfoundland [why
Newfoundland?] dog to it. I heard from the other
side of the House a gentleman, who is at present _ a
member of the Tasmanian Parliament, state facts in
reference to the High Court which, if they were
generally known to ,the people outside, would lead to
a desire to sweep some of its members from the
Bench.
And then, just as the House was wonder-
ing where certain members of the High
Court had planted the body, and how many
girls they had abducted, the subject
dropped. That awful dropping of the sub-
ject is a public misfortune.
IN TOPHET.
WHAT'STHISUS : “ What has happened to old
Assts?"
IT'STHISUS: “ The High Court compelled him to

“Copper Gouger” speaks:—
Re the trouble at the Mount Lyell mine. Last
year the Tas. Government passed an Amending Mines
Bill, which gave miners power to elect two of
their members to make a thorough inspection of the
mine, accompanied by the manager, when any part
of the workings was considered unsafe. Last July
the miners at Mount Lyell appointed two miners as
check inspectors, and the Engineer-in-Chief was noti-
fied. He refused to allow the inspection, and the
matter was hung up for a time. The members for
Darwin were consulted, and were satisfied that the
miners were within the limits of the Act. The man-
agement was again given notice of the miners’ in-
tention, but they refused, and passed them on to
General-Manager Sticht. At an interv ew Sticht held
that the Act was not laid down to his satisfaction,
and asked why the miners worked in the mine if
they considered it unsafe. On October 2 the men
held a meeting at the change of shifts, and two of
them went to the underground foreman and told him
that they objected to work in a certain stope which
they considered dangerous. They were given their
choice—work there or go. They went. This, fol-
lowing on the death of three miners in the Mount
Lyell, brought matters to a head, and at the meet-
ing it was decided not to go below till the manage-
ment allowed the inspection. In cases of this kind
arbitration fails. In the agreement between the Lyell
branch of the F.M.E.A. and the co. there is a clause
providing for grievance committees, but a man who
has a complaint to make must continue working
while inquiries are made, even if in a dangerous
place.
THE LITTLE FOSTER-MOTHER.
“An' th' worst of it is, th' more 'e grows the
'eavier 'e gets, an' the more 'e costs t'

“Clarence O’Hagan” writes: —
I shouldn’t like to be left out altogether in the
rush for King O’Malley’s prize of a long boiled-milk
for the best name for Gas-Oan-Borough. Please ask
him to select from the following: Condenserville,
Fryorfreeze, Dessicata, Dustanash, Dryville, Deserta,
Drearyole, Bottleton, Tankopolis, Norain, Swindleton,
Ikemo, Cohensheim, Loanville, Fraudonus, Hatterton,
Roosterton, Brotherton, Diddleton, Otasell, Dryasell,
Ellsgate, Whooshville and Jerrabilt. 1 may say that
I submitted this list to two town-faking experts—
the Rev. Henry Horsecollar and the of
Faulconbridge. His Grace (who is, I belieye, Nor-
man Lindsay’s uncle, twice removed—once from
Botany and once from Iloly Orders) said that his
predilection was for Otasell, as being both musical
and descriptive. The Rev. Horsecollar chose Swin-
dleton, with Norain for a place. My own preference
is for Cohensheim —but The O’Malley needn’t study
my preferences. If anybody’s feelings are to be con-
sidered they should be the Archbishop’s. He may
have to archbish. there.
“G.V.W.”: Maoriland’s Public
Service Commission reported, amongst
other strange things, that there is a
strong tendency noticeable in each Gov-
ernment Department to deify itself
and utterly ignore the existence of
the other fellow. Correct. Look. The
construction of new railways is under
the control of the Public Works De-
partment, which considers that any
old grade, even to 1 in 40, will do.
Times beyond count the Railway De-
partment has protested, pointing out
that anything steeper than 1 in 80
means the straining, foundering and
premature scrapping of the engines.
The locally made 90-ton engines
working the 1 in 40 grades of the
Main Trunk central section are con-
tinually being sent in for repairs.
When this frequent event occurs the
ever ready bray of the Tory press
anent the superiority of the imported
engine is put into print. Also, it has
been laid down that no roads should
have a steeper grade than 1 in 16,
yet the P.W.D. has constructed roads
with grades of 1 in nine. To nego-
tiate these, local settlers are striving
to evolve a breed of horses with hind-
legs ISin. longer than the forelegs,
and blacksmiths are planning the manufac-
ture of shoes with grappling hooks attached.
“Gee”: The three chief guests at the
manufactures’ week banquet in Sydney
were, divertingly enough, Hughes, Holman
and Senator Millen, anti-Federalists, and
about the most bivoted Freetraders in Aus-
tralasia to-day. They must have felt awk-
ward in view of the extraordinary growth
of manufacturing in N. S. Wales and the
boom that has been raging in the Ma State
of late years—something like a tipster who
finds himself drinking with an army of
clients, after every one of his vaticinations
has been discredited.
“Briner”: Senator Best, supporting the
Navigation Bill, showed that the Aus-
tralian Steamship Federation owned 133
vessels, employing 5000 men. The manning
scale of the Bill would mean £45,414 to
the Federation in increased obligation.
Oversea shipping, in coastal work, .must be
on the same footing. The White Btar
liner Medic paid £685 a month wages. At
Australian rates it would be £430 more.
The steamer Barralong, with crew signed
on outside Australia, competed with coastal
steamers. Wages on the Barralong, £1948
a year, while the coaster Cycle, of the same
size, paid £3996 a year.
A letter has - poured in from Nielsen,
M.L.A., per his assistant, Quinn, and the gist
of it has been published. It contains two
statements —one that the price of meat is
going up in the united States, as it is every-
where else; the other that population in
the U.S. is increasing faster than wheat
supply. The latter fact has been known
for many years, and has been mentioned
in many books of reference, also The
Bulletin gave a mass of figures on the
subject in last Christmas number. A wiser
Ministry than McGowen’s wouldn’t pub-
lish these scraps of old platitude. In fact,
it would never, never mention the name of
Nielsen. It was a bad enough scandal
when that hostile colleague was removed by
being sent to America with £4 or £4 4s. per
day for “expenses,” and his Parliamentary
salary to boot, and a mission to inquire into
the cause of a bit of string or something of
the sort. But it is “rubbing it in” to Keep
reminding the public by letters of this sort
of how little value it is getting for its hard-
earned money. The Nielsen affair stands in
a category by itself. There has been no-
thing exactly like it in N.S.W. for a genera-
tion.
“The Old Soldier”: Re the upheaval in
the Balkans. There is one factor that no
one has, so far, taken into account. None
of the four potential battle-allies in the
Peninsula do any manufacturing to speak
of. They are all what the S. M. Herald
calls “primary producers,” so they have to
import arms and warlike stores,, and even
cloth for their soldiers’ uniforms. The
European winter is nearly due now, and
these four one-horse States are going to war
short of nearly everything they will want.
The European discord will probably take
care they will get nothing from the big
manufacturing countries in the west. The
cable has already told us that the Servian
army lacks uniforms for the men it is put-
ting into the ranks, and that they are going
into bivouac with neither great-coats nor
blankets. That will mean indescribable
suffering by-and-bye, as the weather gets
colder. Manufacturing industries cost a bit
to get going, in the first instance, but there
comes a time in the life of every State when
the nation finds that their absence or other-
wise represents the difference between utter
misery and the worst sort of peril, and com-
parative comfort and safety.
OUT!
The Minister of Customs was not inclined yester-
day to discuss the closing-down of the match factory
of Bryant and May and Bell and Co. Prop't’y, Ltd.,
of South Richmond. When it was pointed out that
insufficient Protection was alleged to be the cause, he
contented himself with the remark that “the firm
knew what the duties were when they established the
industry.”
Yes! And Tudor knew what the salary was
when he took on the industry of being a Federal
member. But, finding the figure unsatisfactory,
he and his friends shoved up their little bit of
Protection by go per cent.
There is unrest these days in the fish-
shops of Australia. Already the last unfor-
tunate scrap between Turkey and Geese has
been forgotten, and the man who sells the
oyster is bursting for another fray. So he
waves the fish round his head, and gives
three sneers for his ancient enemy; and if a
Turk comes in for a plate of pork. he is
almost wild enough to empty the sauce
bottle surreptitiously down the Ottoman
back, and then run for his life, while the Un-
speakable pursues him with curses and much
cruet.
PAHNSHOP POLITICS.
Labor is frightening capital away. —Tory press.
THE LIBERAL AGENT : “Now, if you take my
advice , young man, 'eie's somethink much

The Commonwealth has at last had a
streak of luck in the High Court. The
law re the signinv of political articles at
election times has been held to be constitu-
tional ; and Melbourne Argus, which bucked
up against the statute, has had Costs
dropped on its dishonored head, and pro-
bably feels as if a tower had fallen on it.
“Henry Horsecollar”: So Griffith, of the
N.S.W. Ministry, says he “isn’t afraid of
piling up the public debt”; that he “isn’t
keen” about a sinking fund; and (this was
a very old and brutal Irish joke) that he
had no special enthusiasm about taking
pains to leave the country in a good finan-
cial state for' the benefit of posterity, be-
cause, said Griffith : “I don’t see what pos-
terity has done for us.” Probably Griffith
thought he was very smart when he said
that. But if he lives to be a rich and
miserable (or a poor and miserable) old
man, he will expect a lot from posterity
during the last 10 or 20 or 30 years
of his life. He will expect it to fight for
him if necessary; to do police work for
him; to protect his wealth and to make laws
which will prevent it being snatched away
from him, though it might well be snatched
on the ground that a person who couldn’t see
that posterity had any claim on him, had
no claim on it. Then if he strikes ill-luck
towards the end, he will expect posterity to
pay his pension. He will look to it to run
for the doctor to attend him when he can’t
run himself. He may consider it posterity’s
duty to trundle him to the hospital,
and give him medicine, and sit by his
side at night. And he doubtless expects
that, when he is dead, and doesn’t own a
penny in all time or eternity'—-for the dead
own nothing—posterity will take him to a
decent resting place, with a decent pretence
of sorrow, and put a nice stone above his
head with some nice remarks upon
it. He probably wouldn’t like the
idea of being “buried with the burial
of an ass,” like Jehoiakim of Judah
- —apparently Jehoiakim was left in a
nude condition on an ash-heap. It is
well to remember that by the time the pre-
sent generation of Griffiths reaches the age
of (say) 60, posterity, through sheer
force of numbers, will have sufficient
power, should it feel so inclined, to pass a
Gas Bill declaring the old man in general
to be effete and disqualified. It could take
his money from him by Act of Parliament
on the ground that he was too ancient to
make any good use of it, and it might finish
up by sending him to the Benevolent Asy-
lum as a gummy encumbrance. It is foolish
to be rude and scornful to posterity, because
the latter has so many chances to retaliate.
And it is rotten policy to talk as if pos-
terity deserved nothing but a debt and a
scoff. It is open to it to decide that the
man who talks that way isn’t worth look-
ing after in his later years. Yet he may
have a great manv later years, and may
want a lot of looking after.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 bought a pair of British shoes
With money from my hard hoard ;
The pair of shoes I went to choose
Had soles composed of cardboard.
A slice of leather, thin as ham,
Those wicked soles were glued o’er ;
I tested them and muttered “Dam,”
And carried them to Tudor.
Said I: “These are not fit for wear
In any sort of weather.
A mere delusion and a snare
Imported here as leather.”
The Minister for Foreig-n Trade
My charge could not refute ; he.
Remarked: “The Tariff has been made

Said I to him: “You ought to do
Your duty to your neighbor ;
A Tariff built for Revenue
Is bad for local Labor.”
Said he : “I love the workers still;
But, still, I can’t befriend ’em
As you suggest—well, not until
We’ve passed the Referendum.”

“The Trader is one of the most fascinating books of adventure yet published, and some of
the chanters would be hard to beat for tense dramatic, situations and vivid word-painting,
the ™® r Q s ul " ou^ st U ralian explorers who invade New Guinea in search of pearls, copra and

captured by cannibals, is worth the money itself; and the story of the tiader who has been
dynamited beyond recognition, and who prays his comrades to put an end to offering,
opens up some fine points regarding legal murder and common-sense humanity. Altogether a

ACUTE INDIGESTION.
LIKE A KNIFE THRUST, ALARMING
CONDITIONS. RELIEF OBTAINED
FROM DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT
PILLS.
“I had recently a most severe attack of
indigestion,” says Mrs. Leah Slingsby, of 88
Abercrombie Street, Redfern, ‘‘a large lump
seeming to settle in the region of my chest,
and I became alarmed, for I felt as if my
time bad come at last. I had previous at-
tacks, and did not know what they were,
but this attack was the worst. It was like
a knife thrust, and I could scarcely breathe.
A friend of mine gave me four of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, and persuaded me to try
them. I did so, and I was astonished at
the result, and the day after I was relieved
from all pain, and, on taking a few more, I
became quite well, and now I very seldom
have any symptoms. I have beard that they
are good for rheumatics, of which I occasion-
ally suffer, and I intend to take a course for
its removal. You may use this if you desire
for publication.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
“The Pqnter”: If Duke Foote wins
the Melbourne Cup the G.P.—meaning General
Public or , General Paralysis, either or both —
will not have great cause for rejoicing. The
gents, who are waxing fatter than ever in lay-
ing the early odds (now that publication thereof is pro-
hibited by friendly legislatures) had Duke Foote at
starvation prices for the big handicaps some weeks
ago. The illicit lists published last month (they
are ancient history now, and the present odds are
better buried in oblivion) quoted “Mr. Baron’s”-
bit of hot stuff at three to one for the Met., 12 to
one for Caulfield Gup and five to one for Melbourne
Cup. No previous horse‘has ever been reduced to
five to one for a Melb. Cup six weeks before the
race, and it goes without saying that punters at
large have not taken any Duket Foote thus far, and
are not likely to “go for a gobd win” on him be-
’ tween now and the time for hoisting the result. If
the five-year-old continues in full health and hap-
piness up to the day, he will probably start at prices
that, will look like sudden death, and a lot of it. The
dark Revenue of yore went out at only six to four
against for the Melbourne Cup, which he duly won;
but bis pfice had not been prohibitive during the
previous week, and his backers were numerous. Of
course, Duke Foote has long been recognised among
the cognoscenti as a chamoion of champions. Rheu-
matism was his trouble, and with that stubborn com-
plaint exorcised, his trainer reckoned, upwards of a
year - ago, that there was no handichp horse in Aus-
tralasia to boat him. Whether he wins the Cup or
not is probably a question of whether or no the
rheumatics are dispelled.
Of all the three-year-olds entered for the
Melbourne Cup, nothing looks less, unpromising than
Harpist, who ran like a stayer in the A.J.C. Derby,
and might have actually won a faster run race.
Weighted at 6st. 121 b., Harpist surely has a chance
of repeating the Lord Nolan trick, unless the'three-
year-olds are a very poor lot. Even on their form
in the Derby as it was run, Harpist should beat
Cider (7st. 71b.) in the Cup, for the latter didn’t
appear to: give the son of Sir Tristan a 91b. beating.
S.A. Derby is not a big stake —a sub. of
£5, with £5OO added —but it is much prized locally.
R. M. Hawker’s Tadanga was supposed to have it
settled, but J. James’s Puringa, who always had the
measure of her as a two-year-old, but has been un-
accountably off this season, won comfortably. The
filly was hacked down to six to four on. Now, what
price would the next best be in a field of six, with
bookmakers? Three to one, perhaps. The totalisator
gave Puringa a £6 Is. dividend—a shade better
than five to one, and lie was second favorite. The
stewards felt bound to inquire into Puringa’s run-
ning. as lie had done so badlv of late, but the ex-
planation was satisfactory. It was helped by the
fact that Tadanga was apparently off-color, the little-
known Friar Perfect beating hef for even second
place.
* * * *
The big chestnut horse, Uncle Sam, scored
his fourth successive win by capturing the Toorak
Handicap, as expected. The field was moderate but
the time was good, and Uncle won by a length with
Bst. lib. up. His Caulfield Cup weight, including
penalty, is onlv 7st. 61b., and with him .and,- Captain
White and Flavian in the stable, Mark Whittv has a
first-class chance of landing the big stake next
Saturday for one or other of the three different
owners. Rumor picks Captain White as the “pea,”
but Rumor is an untrustworthy beast. Anvway, it
speaks mysteriously also of the speedy Mountain
Princess. Lochana and others. The wr»*er -fancies
Beverage and Wilari among Tie top weights; Royal
Scotch, Uncle Sam, Hallowmas, Mountain Princess
and Captain White among the middle marks, and no-
thing weighted below 7st. Uncle Sam for choice.
He, at least, has got into a way of coming at the
right end of the journey, and his light weight and
willingness to jump off shoiild ensure him a good
position before the final turn for home.
* * *
The first day of Caulfield Spring Meeting
had some interesting happenings after all. The defeat
qf Lady Medallist in the Stakes' seemed to dispose
of that fancied mare’s chance for the Cup. Her run-
ning, considered in the light of her thickened ap-
pearance, suggests that she is not nearly “wound up,”
and though she may be ripe hy Melbourne Cup time,
she is; probably off the cards for next Saturday’s
event. On paper, Royal Scotch, after winning the
Stakes so easily from end to end, is entitled to first
favoritism' fbr the difficult Caulfield Cup race, in
which, by the way, the most fancied one rarely does
the trick. Wilari and Eudorus performed best of
(he anil the first-named is. Without a doubt,,
in condition just now to run the race of her life.
Time has done a good deal for Wilari since she so
luckily landed the V.R.C. Derby last year, though it
doesn’t seem to have made hef quick off the mark,
an important consideration in a big field of bump inn-
triers. As often as not the Caulfield Cup finish is
fought out, by those only that have been well-placed
all the time. Therefore, the spry Royal Scotch meet-
ing Wilari on 171 b. better terms, is very likely to
beat the mare again if he can stay the 12 furlongs
at pressure. And there are others.
The Guineas. result gives promise of an
interesting V.R.C. Derby. Burrawang and Rath lea,
the only local three-year-olds with anv visible preten-
sions (leaving Wolawa out of the reckoning) to pace
with the best that will, equip from Sydney, were backed
at six to four and three to one respectively. Tbev
finished in their market order, and the long stride of
Burrawang was very impressive as he swept down
the straight. Maybe “Dick” Bradfield’s colt will
prove too good for Cider. He is bred for stamina on
the dam’s side, and his native Australian name is
nothing against him. Unfortunately, Burrawang is
not entered for the Melbourne Cup.

The wiping-out for 12 months of Che-
vally, the crack Victorian steeplechase jockey, came
as a shock to uninitiated followers of what is com-
monly regarded as the cleaner branch of racing
“sport.” Yet it was no. reflection on the intelli-
gence of devoted followers of Chevally’s mounts.
The arrangement in The Wave scandal assured vic-
tory to Chevally, unless his gee-gee fell, in whieh
case the “squared” riders would presumably have had
a go. But The Wave didn’t fall.
* * * »
To any ordinary individual, Duke Foote
would be a boon and a blessing, but to coal baron
Brown his financial scooping is a mere drop in the
barrel. At the A.J.C. Spring Meeting the Duke’s
fleetness brought £502 in the Spring Stakes dead
heat; £4069 as first in the Metrop. ; £1516 first
in the Craven Plate—or a total of £6087 10s. in
less than a week. Verily a case of Fortune greasing
the fat pig.
“Blaekbutt” speaks : Although Duke Foote
had a successful time at the A.J.C. Spring Meeting,
and accounted for the best of Australian horseflesh
(or rather a lot of it) at almost level poundage in
w.f.a. events, it must be remembered that none of
the events were over 12 furlongs. So, even on his
splendid performance, there is no reason to go into
ecstasies over his chances for the two-mile bump-
ing match yclept the Melbourne Cup. When there
was a chance to measure the brute with Trafalgar
in the two-mile Randwick Plate, the coaly baron
saved his neddie’s legs certainly, and possibly his
face, by leaving the field to Trafalgar; and thereby
helped Ilolimoses to further cramp the odds. In
last Melbourne Cup the Duke shut up suddenly after
a mile and,, five furlongs. Therefore, brethren, even
as the Scripture sayeth, “put not your trust in
Dukes, for it is doubtful if they can stay 16 fur-
longs.”
* * * *
Trafalgar went out for his fourth succes-
sive Randwick Plate, two miles, on Saturday, wear-
ing a ladylike bandage low down on his near foreleg.
There was a strained tendon, caused, it is believed,
bv his having been taken too soon, and while below
his best condition, from the tan to the harder tracks.
His owners told the stewards that the leg might go
at any time during the race. The whisper got round
and the champion eased from three to one “on” to
seven to four “on,” in a field of four. John Brown,
the man who came to town to buy clothing, withdrew
Duke Foote, and Aurofodina shortened from fives or so
to five to two against. So Duke Foote’s record at
two miles therefore rests on his Melbourne Cup. And
in the Melbourne Cup last year, with only 7st. 71b.
up, he was nowhere. Trafalgar’s bandaged'leg did go
during the race—quite as fast as the other three, and
the whole four limbs moved rapidly; so rapidly that,
after indulging Aurofodina with a mild lead to the
half distance, he swept past Merton’s nag and collared
1108 sovereigns freshly minted at Maequarie-street.
Cadonia was pipped hy half a length, and in turn just
pipped Aurofodina for second money. Trafalgar fin-
ished strong, and seemed to have something left in
reserve. Slow pace over the first quarter-mile made
the time 1.33, or six seconds slower than Trafalgar’s
Austral'an record in last year’s Randwick Plate. For
a cripple who, apart from his leg, was known to be
some way off being properly wound up, Trafalgar’s
was a mighty fine performance. Duke Foote, if he has
secretly developed into a w.f.a. two mile top-notcher,
might have beaten the three-oarts-fit champion on the
day, but had the Duke been there the race would
have been differently run, and Trafalgar might not
have “busted hisself,” having three good Melbourne
events in view. The “aged” nag has to be run with a
caution not needed for a five-year-old.
Dropping surmise, however, two facts remain.
Jacamar returned to scale before the gates closed for
the night: and Trafalgar limped a little as he came
in. Prolonged jubilant roars greeted the iron chest-:
nut, and one Sydney scribe was so overcome that he
wrote of the reception as resembling “w : nd-lashed
waves beating upon a rock-bound coast.” Trafalgar
has been increasingly popular in Sydney for five sea-
sons now, but last Saturday’s 25.000 made but small
sound compared with the roar of 120.000 when Car-
bine won the Cup. Sundry scribes wrote of the slight
limn of Trafalgar after be had changed from a fast
gallop to a slow walk, as “the beginning of. the end,”
and “a breakdown deplored by many thousands.”
Mere sensationalism ! Notb'ng so interesting as a
general dving in the moment of victory .and a fine
racehorse busting his boiler in one last splendid win.
It is the trail of the melodrama, for which Bland
Holt will one dav have to answer. In all probability
“the leg” will disapnear. and the horse start at Flem-
ington for the Melbourne Stakes, 1| miles, w.f.a.. on
Derby Day; Melbourne Cup. and C. B. Fisher Plate,
11, miles, w.f.a. And. accidents, this writer
will expect to see him still going at Flemington and
Randwick next March and Anril. Cur>s have often
been won by cripples, and gamblers who want odds
about the “deplorably broken-down” sample can easily
get a score of them th : s week.
Trafalgar’s complete record to date is as follows:—-
Un-
Starts. Wins. Seconds. Thirds, placed.
At 2 years 1 ■— 1
At 3 years .. IS 6 2 3 7
At 4 years 10 2 3 2 3

Total: 59 starts, 24 wins, 11 seconds, 6 thirds, 18 un-
placed. Winnings: £22,111. Average per start,
£374 15s. 3d. Started in 12 handicaps for three
wins, one second, two thirds, six unplaced. Started
in 44 w.f.a. events for 21 wins, 10 seconds, four
thirds, 12 unplaced. Also unplaced in Caulfield
Guineas, ATc. Derby and V.R.C. St. Leger. Won at
three miles five times, at two miles nine times, at 11
miles five times, at lj miles three times, at one mile
one furlong twice. At Randwick, 13 wins; at Flem-
ington, nine wins; at Caulfield, one win; at Adelaide,
one win. In addition to his inter-State journevs Tra-
falgar has travelled in his 59 starts. 98 miles 31 fur-
longs. Of that distance he has galloped 25 miles 41
furlongs without winning a bean, so that he amassed
his £22,111 from (1, 2,3) over 72 miles seven fur-
longs.
“The Mug” supnlies a Sydney view of
next Saturday’s Caulfield Cup. The Maorilander,
Royal Scotch, was favorite for the Caulfield Cup
before he left the Dominion. On October 5, he ran
unbacked and unplaced in the V.R.C. October Stakes,
lj- miles, the even-money favorite, Lady Medallist,
winning from Captain White and Wilari. For last
Saturday’s Caulfield Stakes (nine furlongs), Royal
Scotch was the veriest of outsiders : —but he won from
Mousme (W.A.) and Eudprus, with Wilari close up.
Lady Medallist was seven to four favorite, but finished
sixth this time. Royal Scotch has s nee’ then been a
hot favorite for the Caulfield Cup. History is appar-
ently repeating itself. It’s the sprinting Maori-
lander, Pink ’IJn, and his fellow-country boss. Abor-
igine, over again. The former, with a record over
short, distances, was a piping-hot Caulfield Cup favor-
ite, while all the time Aborigine was the Dominion
pea, and he dead-heated with Blue Book, Fink Un
being unplaced. ltoyal Scotch has shown no l£ miles
form anywhere. Lady Medallist, with 9st. 31b. to his
7st. 91b., should lose him on Saturday. But there
are others. Wilari (Bst. 71b.), by Wallace from
Murna, won last season's “triple crown’’ (Victoria
Oaks, Derby, St. Leger), and she’s ripen ng to hit her
top on the day. Westralian Doolette’s Mousme (7st.
131 b.), by The Echo from The Geisha, was second in
the Perth Cup, two miles, and won the W.A. Imperial
Stakes, of 14 miles. On last Saturday’s late run, and
her shrewd ownership, she must be given a show,
though she has only 6st. 121 b. in the Melbourne Cup
and can stav two miles. She may go for both. Mer-
ton’s Aurofodina (9st. lib.) was third, last year, with
Bst. 71b. He’ll run forward under W, 11. Smith.
Sculley’s two—Cisco (Bst. 71b.) and Lochano (7st.
71b.) —did nothing at Randwick, but they are both
in Melbourne and have accepted. Flavian (Bst. lib.)
should beat his stable mates Captain White and Uncle
Sam. Trafalgar’s half-brother, Gillamatong, is being
resurrected, and reads better with Bst. 51b. than
Flaith (7st. 91b.), from the same establishment. Kar-
riattan (7st. 71b.), fourth in Sydney Cup, may give
trouble. Wilari should collar the lucre from a tangle
composed of one of Scully’s, Lady Medallist, Mousme
and Aurofodina.
* * *
“Another Mug” : My shrewd suspicion is
that the horse that wins Caulfield Cup, and more so
Melbourne Mug, will be the one that carries least
public money.
* * * *
Ideal cricketing weather bestowed itself
on the concluding half of the first round for the
V.C.A. pennant, consequently the skippers who had
gone in on the first (and wet) Saturday had either
to play for the draw or reap defeat. East Melb.,
with the assistance of E. V. Carroll, younger brother
of inter-State player E. L. Carroll, who compiled
124, put together 225 for nine wickets, and then de-
clared', leaving the premiers, Nortlicote, a very brief
time to crowd in a victory. In fact, the pace was
so breathless that the entire team fell over itself for
a mere 121 runs, thus losing the game by 104 runs.
Carlton, with six sorrowful ducks embellishing its
scoring-sheet, toilsomely acquired 103 in all. ’Var-
sity rushed them up swiftly for the loss of two
wickets, after which ex-College boy Park amused
himself till he had acquired 83 ; the Shop’s total
being 168 for five wickets. South rattled up 226 for
nine against Essendon’s 80, then declared, and set
out to polish off ’Don , again, but time and the
stonewallers blocked the Southerners from their
three-point outright win. P'ran's first innings’ tally
of 79 made it a gift for ’Roy, the total being reached
with the loss of six wiekets. St. Kiida, having made*
28 for one wicket the week before, apparently set out
with the express intention of making a draw, its
batsmen stodgily and carefully compiling 170—of
which Sundries made third highest score, 36. Then
Richmond bogged-in, and had collected 104 runs for
nine wickets when the umpires closed the discussion.
The Melb.-’Wood relaxation was chiefly notable for
the uprising of a youthful ’Woodsman, T. Erring-
ton, who hastily put together 113 out of 269 against'
the bowling of Callender, Warwick Armstrong’s little
brother Tom, and two trundlers named Johnstone.
No bowler startled himself during the' afiernoon,
though ancient Bob Mitchell, of ’Cote, took four for
29; Anderson and Willis, of ’Varsity, four for 37
and three for 11 respectively; and Marcow, of
Richmond, four for 50 ; but it is too early yet to say
whether these outbreaks were feats or accidents.

The second round of Sydney first-grade
cricket commenced on Saturday. Weather was warm
but ideal, and some of the performances likewise.
S. Moore, of North Sydney, astonished the natives
and bewildered the bowlers by smashing and driving
205 before Andrews clean bowled him. He built up
a sky-scraper of 115 before giving the ghost of a
chance; and then feeling that he could afford to
take risks, he took every darned thing that was go-
ing. He was the third man to go in, and when he
arrived at the crease his side had accumulated 16
for the loss of two wickets——which was far from
inspiriting. He was the sixth man to depart,
leaving the score at 346. His performance included
30 fours and five sixes: and-he piled up h r s score
in 24 hours. The next star batsman was D. A. Gee, of
Middle Harbor, who threw together 114 in 65
min’ tes, and whose effort inch died five sixers and
16 fours. He was as stiff as a rusty hinge afterwards,
and apparently succumbed to sheer exhaustion. These
were the two bright particular stars of the afternoon,
and the only men to put together three figures. E.
P. Barbour (of University) had the bad luck to be
pipped at 94 bv Dnlv off Folkard. Cody, of Pad-
dington, was also going strong, but got thrown out at
92; after which there is a hiatus in the string of gems
till Collins, of Sydney, scintillated at 83. Below
him they straggle off to the 51 of Tozer, of the Uni-
versity. Among the bowlers 'Bowden, of Gordon,
where the weary Titan, Wade, comes from, was easily
best with seven wickets for 44 runs, lie bowled 16.5
overs, and sent along four maidens. From h's
figures to the seven for 76 of Mailev, of Redfern, is a
long drop. Mailev sent down 17,4 overs, blit only
on» maiden. That o-ood old reliable trundler, Folk-
ard, whose capabilities have never been recognised in
the right quarter, took six gorgeous University
wickets for Balmain, for 81 runs, sendrhg along 23.3
overs, but no maidens. Cullen, of Glebe, bowled 17
overs (one a maiden), and took five wickets for 51
runs. Dnpain, of Bnrwood, did not make 5 so big a
splash, but what there was of it was high quality. He
sent along eight overs (no maidens), but of the
five wiekets that fell during the afternoon, he took
three for 21 runs—and it’s mighty good work. So
much for the individual.
As for the machine: Sydney did 215 against Gor-
don, which replied with two wickets for eight—which
is just plain putrid. Paddington’s record was 247
off Glebe, and never did the Butchers get a chance
to respond. Middle Harbor, in spite of Gee’s 114,
accumulated only 198 aga'nst Waverley, which replied
with 177 for the loss of three wickets. Middle Har-
bor seems to be in the mud, and a team which leaves
the getting of 114 to one man, and then only adds 74
for the other 10 men, deserves to be op the tip, or in
the municipal garbage destructor, or some such place.
North Sydney, thanks to Moore’s mighty score, piled
up 473 for the loss of eight wickets against Peter-
sham. Rumored that Petersham has taken to drink.
Burwood, the haughty Western suburb, could only
show 151 aga’nst Redfern, where! the Syrian com-
patriots reside; and the Syrians replied with 84 for
the loss of five wickets. University biffed 216 in the
first innings, and Balmain banged'4s. but lost two
wickets while doing it. But, after all, ’twill be all
the same in a century—in fact, it will he all the
same after next Saturday night. Nothing matters so
long as the batsmen were happy and the bowlers in a
state of delectation.

“George Street”: Philadelphia (TJ.S.A.)
has always plaved a certain amount of cricket, and
somewhere in the early 80’s of last century a team
from that Quaker-founded city visited Fogland and
tried conclusions with a few minor English counties
and Universities and things. Philadelphia is not
the sort of church or community or locality in which
you would expect to find the “greatest all-round
cricketer in the world,” hut Bert Kortlang, who cer-
tainly is entitled; to speak on the subject,; declares
that just there and nowhere else the champion of
champions is to be found. His name is Bart King.
Kortland declares that he is the fastest bowler in
the United States, takes a run of about 15 yards,
leaps high in the air, and, with a “double overarm
swing” (whatever that may be) causes his lightning-
speeded ball to swerve from either side. It sounds
a pretty terrific business, and ought to make a good
music-hall turn if it can be done to limelight and
cheerful music': Kortland also declares-that - ivmg is
a brilliant bat, with a fine variety of strokes on both
sides; but the prize statement of all refers to a
game in which Kortlang himself took part. King
ordered everyone off the field except myself, and me
he placed at fine leg. The umpires made some demur,
but decided that there was no rule to prevent a side
fielding short.” Then the demon bowled with all
the acrobatic grace he could muster, and knocked
the leg stump clean out of the grqumj. . When asked
why he left the Australian in the field, the cham-
pion replied, “Oh, merely to pick up the stump.
Whether Kortlang is pulling the cricket public s fine
leg, or merelv pulling its leg finely, or simply re-
lating facts on which he is prepared to swear his
solemn curse is not much clearer than a bush um-
pire’s decision on a beery afternoon re a vexed ques-
tion of l.b.w.
* * * *
Let all Australians, especially
ians, make a joyful noise before the Lord, for Alf
Grenda, the burly Apple-Islander, has set a halo pn
his bike-handles by overthrowing a big field in the
race for the World’s Mile Professional Champion-
ship. The tussle took place at Newark, in the land
where they burn n ggers and sell convicts into
slavery. E. A. Pve, of Victoria, also made a wild
dash for the spoil, but' went under to Friol, of
France. Maorilander F. Wells had the luck, or mis-
fortune, rather, to meet Frank Kramer in his first
effort, and scored only second place. He was in verjy
much the same • position as the mayor of a Devon-
shire town, who was so popular that the people
unanimously elected him ex-Mayor next year. But
in the end Grenda cleaned up the field of heroes and
gave Tasmanian eyei ng circles good and sufficient
reason to go on a howling burst.

Wanted: A society for the extermination
of motor cvclists who hang. round the vanguard Of
push-bike races. F’rinstans, E. S. Perrett, the actual
winner (on performance) of the Dunlop Gold Clip
Road Race from Camperdown to Melbourne (116
miles), has now been disqualified for receiving motor
pace during the contest. The position of Perrett has
been awarded to E. Barrie, who fimshed second. The
trouble is that the motor cyclist who caused the
trouble goes scot free. Every long-distance bike race
is now attended by these motor-bike hogs; many of
whom apparently lay- odds against some favorite win-
ning. To make sure he doesn't, they blow along On
their motor-bikes, and by riding along just ahead of
him, make him pace unconsciously. And the result
is a protest, and then the “pacer” collects his money
but the rider loses everythin o ' —including his rermija-
tion. A society for the kicking of the intruding
motor-bikist might fill the bill —-if he can be caught
to be .kicked. If he travels too fast, then let the
shanghai hurtle his death charge through the inter-
vening space. A shanghai is a weapon of civilisa-
tion.
* * * *
The Mclntosh-Musgrove Tug-of-War was
a success, and just, about the same crowd rolled up
each night to watch the tussles. “Tugging” has its
votaries; and they are enthusiastic, not to say fan-
atical. The Mclntosh has some of the stuff in him
of which generals are made —he is a terror for dig-
nity and the frill that makes for mighty effort. Frill,
properly managed, counts for a lot in the affairs of
this world. F’rinstans, when a British force gets
the devil knocked out of it, and has to retire, but (he
enemy is not strong enough to follow up—like the
Boers at Majors •ontein —the bringing-in of the
wounded is a sacred rite. The whole army stands to
the salute and sings “Hail to the Mighty!” as the
shattered soldiers are carried past. But all that
sort of pomp and circumstance was a (rifle com-
pared to the dignity with which a tug-o’-war team
enters the Stadifitfr. It comes in single file; the
band plays crashing music; and the captain carries
the team's banner with a stately tread. The men
mount the platform, and march right round it in
single file, and all suddenly collapse on their sides
after the captain has struck his gonfalon in the
earthen floor and taken up his position. In the final
struggles'things became very strenuous. Three Aus-
tralian teams had to decide among them which should
represent the Continent against the little countries
of Europe—Hcckenbergs’ Parramatta Australian
team; Fitzpatrick’s Australian team; and the Carl-
ton (Melb.) Brwery Australian team. Fitz's team
outed the Heckenbergs by nine inches the first night;
and then the Carlton crowd, full of malt and hops,
hauled Fitz’s team into an upright position. At the
last the Beer Team of Australians met the Scotch
team —a Splendidly handled and captained agglomera-
tion—and hauled it into a sitting posture after a
fearsome struggle. It was a mighty concentrated
and altogether heave, and it caught the Scotehies
just between the acts, and suddenly jerked the Piets
into a sitting posture, and caused each man to curse
in Gaelic. Against beer-fed Australians the foreign
nations had no hope. They were chaff opposed to
solid lead, or a forest devil, or something of the sort.
One great outstanding feature of the tug is the over-
throw of the Fitzpatrick system of tugging in favor
of the six-inch cleat of the Melbourne beer-makers.
In Fitz's method your tugger lies down on his side
and hauls for his life, but has to change the position
of his hands on the rope—which means that after each
haul, the team that has gained anything has to let
go the rope to get a fresh purchase. The Melbourne
Hop Malt style has small cleats ranged six inches
apart, and the men never let go the rope. They hang
on to that all the time, and get their purchase by
working their feet from one cleat to another.

SCIENTIFIC EXERCISES AID NATURE.
gd
It’s natural for you to be healthy.
But you cannot retain your natural healthy state, unless you
aid Nature by keeping your system thoroughly toned up. .
In your everyday habits there are certain groups of internal
muscles which you scarcely ever use. Nature intended you
to use them, and unless you do use them—they will gradually
wither—-they then cannot do their work —-and upon the condi-
tion of your internal muscles your good health depends.
Imagine how much better you’d feel if your weak spots were
made strong. How much more you’d enjoy life if all your
important muscles were thoroughly and systematically nour-
ished. And just imagine yourself having only to do 15 minutes’
scientific exercise daily to accomplish these beneficial results.
You will assuredly get these results from my Postal CotiRSE
op Health Exekcises, because you will receive exercises
specially suited to your physique—scientific exercises which
will bring into use every muscle in your frame.
This is an extract from a pupil’s report:—'
“I am very pleased to inform you that. I am in the best
of health and am gaining strength every day from your
simple and wonderful exercises. The muscles of my arms,
back and stomach are developing rapidly. Your cpurse,;
has proved to be exactly what you claim.”
C. U., Beaconsfield, Ta,s.
Think how much your health means to you, and think how '
easy it is to retain or regain it when you go about, it
in the common-sense, natural way—-the base on which the
Baker Postal Course op Health Exercises is founded.. .
You ought to write for further information and fees for my
Postal Course op Health Exercises. An 18 page, interesting
folder, entitled, “Physical Instruction by Post,” will be sent
you. Write now. c,,;

Hansard Land.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With glasses on nose, and big scissors in
hand,
I browse through the paddocks of Hansard-
Land;
Where each blade of grass is a little, black
type,
Which, added together, make columns of
tripe,
Such as: —
Mr. Higgs asked the Minister of Trade and Cus-
toms, upon notice: —
(1) Whether it is a fact that in certain timber
areas in Queensland the whole of the tops of pine
logs now left in the bush to rot, can be used for the
manufacture of wood pulp for paper-making?
(2) Will the Government favorably consider the
question of granting a bonus to encourage the manu-
facture of wood pulp? ■
Mr. Tudor: The answers to the honorable member’s
questons are:—
(1) I believe that to be the case.
(2) Yes.
Yes! —by-and-bye ; but the time isn’t ripe!
Most HANSARD-uand paddocks are horribly
dry—
Full of dreary, brown verbiage, seven feet
high !
And the skulls and the bones of dead Bills
are concealed
In the tangle of speeches that covers each
field,
Such as:—
Mr. Kelly : My motion and other motions to which
I have referred are all in the direction of extending
fair dealing and liberty. On the other hand, the
honorable member for Melbourne proposed to deny
pressmen the liberty to conduct their profession as
they themselves think fit, regarding, apparently, the
necesssity to provide an article with a name as of
such paramount importance that the liberty of the
journalistic profession should be further whittled
away. There is a motion on the paper in regard to
the butter trade.
— Butter? Alas! These dry cows never
yield !
Here and there —but seen rarely—the
stranger will pass
A thin trickle of humor amid the dead
grass;
But the water is brown, and half-brackish
at best;
Yes, the flavor is flat in the HANSARD-Land
jest,
Such as:—
Mr. King O’Malley : The answers to the questions
are :
(1) It is considered that the Local Option Laws of
New South Wales have ceased to be applicable to the
Federal Capital Territory, and are no longer operative
therein.
(2) The matter will be borne in mind.
(3) At present there is only one public house in
the Federal Capital Territory, some miles away from
the city site.
— Only one pub in the Waterless West!
Some HANSARD-Land paddocks have grass
that is green,
Where I much love to rove with my scissors
so keen!
There the cows are quite active, and moo!
with much spite,
And their bellows and tramplings give
Pressmen delight,
Such as:—
The Speaker: The honorable member must with-
draw and apologise.
Mr. Blank : I won’t withdraw! Why should I
apologise ?
The Speaker: The honorable member is again dis-
orderly. He must withdraw and apologise.
Mr. Dash : Mr. Speaker, I would ask
The Speaker : Order! The honorable member is
out of order! He will resume his seat. Does the
honorable member for Duck-egg withdraw?
Mr. Blank :No ; I don’t! Why the should I
withdraw ? Do your worst!
Mr. Dash : That’s right. Give the cow fits!
The Speaker : Sergeant, remove the honorable
member!
(Some disorder, during which the sitting was sus-
pended. )
—Any old House where the members show
fight!
N.S.W.
O. C. CABOT.
The Wrongs of Longwincl, K.C.
The Bulletin has received this letter, and
referred the matter to its solicitor:—
Mr. Justice Bulletin, —Y’r Honor. I appear (in-
structed by Messrs. Thick and Graball) on behalf
of my learned friends, Mr. Longmin >. K. 0., and Mr.
Briefsnatcher, to demand apologies, withdrawal,
explanation, reparation, humiliation, damages and
costs from all those sneering satirists, beginning
with the late esteemed W. Siiakspeaße, and ending,
for the time be ng, with your unesteemed self, who
have been in the habit of throwing off at my educated
pals as responsible for the “law’s delays,” “the
waste of time in the courts,” and so forth. By
reason of the said aspersions my clients have suffered
grievously in estimation, reputation and feelings, and
I propose to show that they are not as tar-colored as
they are painted. That is to say, I will tender evi-
dence that my cultured cobbers are not, in the main,
responsible for the evils laid to their charge. I
direct your attention to. two matters only, which are
at present in more or less public prominence.
Item 1. You have probably observed that the
solicitor for what is known as “the Coal Vend,” has
recently publicly explained, apropos of the costs to
which his clients have been put, that Mr. Justice
Isaacs occupied three days, or the best part of that
time, in the mere' delivery of his judgment, during
which time a whole row of gents.—a dozen or so-
sat and listened in solemn silence at a cost, we are
gravely told, of £5OO. The lawyer who has to
compile the bill says so, and he should know. It
is obvious that this was sheer waste of time and
talent (for you will at least admit talent on the
part of my friends, Briefsnatcher and Co.). The
judgment was, of course, written out, but Tradition,
or Etiquette, or some other untamed prehistoric beast
required that this performance of oral delivery
should be solemnly gone through. The Judge, who
had doubtless labored hard and long at composing it,
dictated it to an amanuensis, revised the proof, and
re-read the copy, must have been pretty full up of
his own composition and the sound of his own voice,
and have rather yearned for a phonograph to give
it to the world. But he had to solemnly unburden
himself of it viva voce for three solid days—and the
costs were £5OO. The learned gents, who earned
that sum by sitting steadily in their chairs, had
“briefs to hear Judgment.” That is the usual thing,
and you must understand that it is a discourtesy
or insult to the Court, not to be wiped out in apolo-
gies, blood, or costs, for counsel to stay away when
his Honor is delivered of his finding. On a delivery
of judgment there is in general nothing for counsel
to do but wait patiently until the end, , and then
jump up and demand costs out of the other side, or
out of the estate, and it seems a tremendous price to
pay for that, even when the extra fees do not total up
to £5OO. Judges have, by the way, a curious habit
of finishing up a delivery of judgment by blandly
inquiring of one counsel or the other: “And what do
you say about costs, Mr. ?” Then ensues, in
any ease, a lengthy argument, dispute or wrangle, on
a subject upon which the Judge has probably made
up his mind already (or should have, anyway).
The obvious thing for Mr. Justice Isaacs to do
was to send a copy of his judgment to the learned
gents, on each side, and, as the Immortal Bard here-
inbefore cited observes, “there an end.” At the
least, they might have been informed beforehand that
the delivery of judgment would begin on (say)
Monday, and told to come up on Wednesday after-
noon if his Honor wanted them to talk about costs,
instead of wearing out the court furniture, at £5OO
remuneration.
Modern Instance No. 2. A State Judge of the
highest tonnage lately sat for six days adjudicating
on a commonplace squabble between two cockies
about the sale of a farm, apparently a pure question
of fact. A couple of local, grass-fed arbitrators
would probably dispose of the whole contention in
a less number of hours and with as reasonable a
probability of doing substantial, if not refined, jus-
tice. But the logical answer, of course, is that this
is what courts and Judges are constituted for, and
so the highest court of the State sits day after day
tediously extracting evidence from two sets of wit-
nesses. It is tedious, and herein is the point of my
gibe. The whole of the evidence is being taken down
by a typist in court—nevertheless, the Judge also
takes it down laboriously, with elaborate detail and
endless correction. A specimen of the proceedings.
A witness is called, name John Jackson.
His Honor (taking it down) : “Jack Johnson.”
(Interval of five minutes for correction, and great
laughter over his Honor’s innocent inquiry, “Who is
Jack Johnson?”)
Finally the tangle is straightened out, when the
Judge inquires of the witness how he spells his
name, whether with a “t” or a “y,” because he re-
members that a family of that name once, etc., etc.
(Ten minutes time for reminiscences about the old
family). The witness explains that they were pro-
bably his mother-in-lawls uncles twice removed.
More delay barking up wrong, trees about people in
the misty past, whom the Judge thought he had
identified, and didn’t. Then the witness is asked a
question, and answers: “I went into the bar to get
a drink.” His Honor (taking it down) : “I went
into the bank to get Why did he go into a bank
for a drink ? I recollect that in the early days the
manager of the bank used to keep a bottle of
rum under the counter for” (More explanations
and correction by everybody, and further ancient
history smothered by -the witness, who repeats his
answer in a loud voice.) Tlis Honor (coming at the
fence again) : “Oh, ah, yes-—the bar. I went into
the —ah —the bar —I went into the bar —to g'et—ah—-
to get—ah—l went into the bar to get—ah—to get
—ah”- Until everyone is itching to yell at him,
“a drink 1”
The typist, of course, had it all down five minutes
ago. Nevertheless, this traction-engine or Clydesdale
style, of chirography has to go on laboriously, with
its constant interruptions, : and shying and baulking
at obvious words. : Heaven knows what is done with
the typist’s copy, unless . they use it to stoke the
court radiators. One: may remark, in passing, that
a Judge should be in a position to take a bird’s-eye
view, of the evidence, instead of the worm’s-eye view
of the insect : who is painfully tracing it on paper,
especially when the expert worm is actually there spank-
it out on a tynewriter. By the time his Honor had got
down the word “drink,” he remembers some inane
remark once made to him bv Lord Audledegge
in the course of a casual conversation, and proceed-
ings ' are - held up accordingly. My complaint about
all this 'is the tedium imposed on my unfortunate
learned mates, for they are paid to work, and not to
endure the boredom of three-day judicial speeches,
and pretend an interest in the Judge’s ancient remin-
iscences, and the flatulent observations of his dis-
tinguished friends, even at the rate of five hund— — 1
But enough! -My point is made! Why should
you heap contumely, reprobation, mud and borac on
my long-suffering clients as “time-wasters,” “costs-
builders,” etc., when all they are guilty of iA an
occasional yawn. I confidently look for an apology
from your crimson sheet, at least equal to prominence
and extent to the stings of the outrageous criticism,
you have from time to time published. A wnoie
issue of the B. devoted to it would be about, adequate.
—Yours threateningly, Bill o’ Costs.
A Cry from Panama.
“J.R.” : Thus Charles Markham, on the
famous Cuelebra Cut, the bugbear of the
Panama Canal directors :
The measures are hard, and require a tremendous
amount of blasting and drilling, but as soon as the
rock is exposed to the atmosphere it crumbles away
to dust, and in a few weeks’ time trees and shrubs
spring up on land that had previously been buried
400 ft. or 500 ft. deep. In the bottom of this huge
chasm countless numbers of men are at work....
With a depth of cutting so vast, it will be readily
understood that difficulties would be experienced with
the slopes. The deeper the cutting the more ac-
centuated does this become, because great slips are
continually pouring down into the bottom, and the
ground is developing great a mile away,
showing that the whole of the hills are on the slide.
How deep these cracks may go, or how far back, is
a matter of conjecture, but all are terribly afraid of
the serious nature of the trouble that lies at this
point.... There are several soft layers of clay which
allow the rock to*, slide. There are also one or two
huge faults, which break up and disintegrate the
measures. . .-.lt is verv probable that the cutting will
be five miles across at the top before the sides cease
to run in, IF EVER' THEY DO, for the rock in the
bottom cut of all turns to mud in a short time when
in contact with water, and the wash of the propellers
will suck this mud away.
The cut is not yet filled with water, and pre-
sumably is not likely to be till the sides
cease slipping, and no one even pretends to
know when that is likely to be, since they
are now always at it. It is said to be quite
a common thing for the railway lines, with
long trains of waggons, to slide down side-
ways into the cut. Two breakdown trains
are kept constantly under steam to deal with
accidents, one with a 100-ton, and the other
with a 75-ton crane to lift overturned loco-
motives, and set them on their wheels again.
It is not a question of engineering lore. The
canal is absolutely unique. Nothing at all
like it has ever been attempted before, and
there is no past experience to guide the con-
structors. The peculiar geological forma-
tions —the rock that crumbles to dust as
soon as it is exposed to the air, and becomes
a nice, friable, fertile soil; and the other
rock, found in the bottom cut of all, which
dissolves into mud when water is let in on
it—are' tremendous handicaps in themselves.
If the canal ever really is opened,; and the
traffic proves nearly up to expectation, that
mud ; will be very effectually churned up by
the propellers of the liners passing through
the cut, and carried down from lock to lock
in the staircase at each end, and so into the
harbors in each ocean, silting them up and
calling for constant dredge work. The _ en-
gineers themselves admit they have no idea
what will happen when the water is let into
the Cuelebra Cut, which will have to’be the
first section-of the canal filled. The possi-
bilities are so serious that they dread to
prophesy.

WICTORIA PARK, on Race Day, holds
* the same attraction for sporting enthusiasts
as Epsom on Derby Day. The racing is keen,
exciting and thoroughly disciplined.
VictoriaJßark has the honor of running the
largest fields in the State, as many as 30 to 38
horses being frequently dispatched by the starter.
From an artistic point of view, Victoria
Park leaves nothing to be desired. The lawns
are trim and well-kept, with a profusion of
flower-beds, now in full bloom, the har-
monious blending of vari-hued flowers present-
ing a picture of unsurpassed beauty.
The Racing Tracks are oval in shape—
every detail tending to make perfection being
attended to. Four tracks in all, with a levelled
grass centre used exclusively for coursing con-
tests.
The next Race Meeting will be held on
Wednesday, October 23. Zetland trams from
the Railway (id. Section) or Circular Quay, run
at frequent intervals. De Groen’s Vice-Regal
Band will play on the Lawn during the after-
noon’s sport.
First Race 2 p.m.

HOW “ANTINEURASTHIN”
REMEDIES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
It is, in the first place, essentially a food —not a
drug stimulant.
It is a food that feeds the whole of the nervous
system with those elements the lack of whieh in the
structural tissues constitutes the neurasthenic con-
dition.
It is so easily assimilated that in one hour it is
fully absorbed, thus creating- quickly a renewed
mental and physical vigor. This is not mere stimu-
lation, but is really the sensation produced by the
actual assimilation and storage of those refined ele-
ments necessary to nerve comfort and vigor. This
is not—as in the case of tonics and stimulants—a
mere transient whipping up, but an actual addition
to the nerve structure and nerve strength of the in-
dividual. A FREE TRIAL

plaints, and containing analysis ; of Antineurasthin,

Kenneth Neill: You say (among other
things) The Bulletin “doesn’t seem to realise” that
“Great Britain, as a manufacturing nation, must get
the bulk of her raw stuff from countries of primary
production, and the U.S.A. is one of the chief of
these." Aren’t you a trifle behind with your views,
and do you fully realise that it is no use depending on
the facts you learned at school ? Circumstances change
so fast that you need to read up your subject afresh
every year. Nowadays (1) the United States is
nearly three times as great a manufacturing country
(judged by value of output) as Great Britain. (2)
The United States now exports more value in manu-
factured goods than in raw material. (3) It imports
more raw material than it does manufactured goods.
(4) Britain is also an exporter of raw material.
The second biggest item on its export list is that
irreplaceable raw material —coal....Sick Demo: (1)
The trouble isn’t about “the hustlers who are graft-
ing for the retention of Government House as a resi-
dence for the G.G.,” to use your own words. It is
rather about the hustlers who are trying to turn
out the Governor of Australia, in order to make
extra space and extra glorification for the State
Governor, despite the fact that they are pledged to
abolish State Governors. Of course the Three
Stomachs of Hunter-street were a magnificent and
foolish jest, but that doesn’t make the effort to
exalt the State at the expense of all Australia any
less unpleasant. (2) You say you would lay big
odds that a certain bank manager (whom you don't
name) has an interest in The Bulletin. * Well, if
you are not a cur, come along and lay the odds.
Every person who has an interest in The Bulletin
is a working member of the staff with one exception,
and that exception is the founder and long-time
editor of the paper, now retired through ill-health.
It is a curious thing that people of your sort always
howl “corruption” if a paper doesn’t fall in with
your parochial views. Do you judge everybody by
yourself ?.... Blut Wtirst: Poem herewith:—
AN UNHAPPY EPISODE.
From her home in Sunny Kent
a Fair young Assisted Immigrant went
And came to Sunny australasia.
Many Years before her Lover Bold
had gone out there to seek for Gold
But having failed he would not facer.
Having no one to meet her the Unfortunate
Emmigrant wept Bitterly over her fate
And asked God to Defend.
An officer in the immigration Department
Taking Pity on her and with Evil intent
Did pretend to be her Friend.
He took her to a house of Name Unclean
and Often went to see her there I Wean
He wick’dly told the Unfortunate her Lover
had just sailed to England with another.
Hearing these words the poor Assisted cried
And I so soon to be a Mother?
The immigration Officer’s wrath was roused
And shrieking have I a harlot clothed and housed
He pushed her from the door
To wander the streets ever more.
She asked God with her Dying breath
To help her Babe avenge her Death.
He grew to be a man the strongest ever seen
and he sought and found that immigration O.
and killed him with a Dead marine.
....Abel H.: The best excuse for “Lines at Eve”
is that you were drunk when you committed them.
When the drink is in—and when there is a large
quantity of it in, and all of it bad —the Muse mostly
goes! on a dreadful jag. .. .H.B: Can’t decide, in the
absence of the Office Cannibal at the A.J.C. races,
whether you should be boiled for your drawings or
fired out on account of your gags. Call in at any
time after 9.15 next week, and we will formally
deliver judgment... .P. Tighe: You write —“I want
to know why you so constantly leave Queensland
out of your ‘Plain English’ column (or any other
column) ? And we answer—-We don’t. On the con-
trary, we devote a page to Q. affairs almost every week.
As regards your statement “that you have been buy-
ing The Bulletin for 27 years,” we can but deduce
that you are either (a) an illiterate or (6) a liar....
Bunsen: Basket.... Albert F.: Have an idea it was
just before he went into the owl-boiling business....
F.C.B.: “I’d Sing to Thee” is a sort of poet’s pros-
pectus. It promises immense things, but neglects to
mention where the works are situated... .Concertina:
Rather wheezy verse. .. .S.J.R.: Gloomy story about
goats, Chinamen and tainted water turned down
Bellbottom: “The Murder” brought joy to the office.
Some of it: —
Then swift by the hair
He dragged her out.
And with kicks and push
Did bash her about
Till mad with the drink,
And revengeful,
He caught up the ax
And smote dreadful.
One blow with the head,
Killed the poor wife.
Her blood flowed like mud,
From Etna’s strife.
He reddened his hands,
In her clotting gore,
And rubbed all his face,
And cursed some more.
Then said; ‘oh my wife,
I’m sorry sad,
I shall end my own life,
I’m terrific mad.’
He wandered around,
Like a wild bull.
And his hair now red,
Hard did he pull.
He seized a knife-long,
Drove it with shout,
To his black heart deep,
For police to pull out.
Write some more like that, but don’t soften it down
so much. We like it with all its natural blood and
horror... .F.J.F.: Gory and immoral verse useless...
C.O.S.: “The Miner’s Day Out” might have made a
story if it had been about something and decently
written. Filthy MS Primus: Very poor attempt.
Percy Vere: And all that to say you : got
wet through when out with your best girl in the
mountains! G.S.E.D.: “The Swagman” is no
good Tomcatiline: “Holy Willie’s Wail” would be
fairly good if the ideas were a little brighter, the
rhythm a lot better and the general atmosphere
cleaner ; but the birth bonus, as a subject for topical
verse, has been dead for several weeks. May it keep
dead... .H.E.: “A Wanderer’s Lament for the Bush”
is lamentable enough verse to be an elegy on a dead
camel, or even an epitaph to a very dead camel....
Gumleaf: You may talk it over “in some distant
time and star,” or in some near time and pub, but
you won’t talk, sing, or observe it in this paper,
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
D. Appelbe: The drawback is that in each case
it is just one person saying something to another.
And almost any person might say that sort of thing
to almost any other person. Thus, a Bulgarian
might say it to a whaler, or a Jew to a footballer,
or a congenital idiot to a Baptist, or a dwarf to an
American duke, or an Assyrian to a grocer, or a
Jebusite to a suffragette. So you just draw two per-
sons—one with the mouth open to show that he or
she is speaking, and one with the ear turned round
to show that he or she is listening. And then you
put your joke—the thing the thug said to the chess-
player—underneath H.T.G.: Picture horrible.
Joke old and horrible. Almost all sea-sickness jokes
are horrible, and most of them are old. Man began
to study the subject early. .. .G.A.C.: Heaven only
knows what these characters are you have drawn. Is
one a cocky and the other a pterodactyl?... .P.W.H.:
Drop the Baby Bonus joke. It never was much of
a joke....Syd Lendon: A variation—and not a very
varied variation either—of an ancient jape.

HAVE YOU A BAD LEG
with Wounds that discharge or otherwise,
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your tinger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
If so, under the skin you have poison which
defies all the remedies you have tried. Per-
haps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolo ed, or there
may be wounds; the disease, if allowed to
continue, will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hos-
pitals, and been told your case is hopeless,
or advised to submit to amputation, but do
not, for I can cure you. I do not say per-
haps, but I will. Because others have failed
is no reason I should. Send to the Drug

“0.K.”: The old Baconspeare controversy is being
warmed up again in London, and some interesting
contentious splutter from the frying-pan. Among the
Bacon partisans, one William Smedley instances a
Hamlet speech to his former chums, Guildenstern
and Rosenerantz, as being a notable specimen of
majestic English prose, and argues that one of
Henry V.’s. speeches “reveals all the subtlety of a
legally trained mind.” From these he suggests:
“It is impossible to believe that a man who could
write such prose would confine himself to the small
portions found in his plays. Where are Shakspeare’s
prose writings?” But it may be reasonably assumed
that if Shakspeare was the actor and manager he is
said to have been, he was kept too busy with poetic
play-writing in his spare time to be able to do
much prose, and that any prose he may have written
was not thought worth publication by that practical
showman. A staunch believer in the genuineness of
the Immortal Bard argues that “the method of Shaks-
peare was essentially that of the artist, whereas the
method in all Bacon’s .English writing is that of a
scholar. The two are quite different. Whoever
wrote Shakspeare’s plays was a showman. This is
evident in their dramatic texture, and in the way in
which song and dance are introduced whenever there
is a danger of the dramatic interest flagging. The
plays are full of scholastic inaccuracies, which I can-
not believe any scholar would have allowed to be pub-
lished.” Which latter familiar clause in the in-
dictment of Baconcrankery seems always good enough
to swear by. Bacon’s prose writings prove him to
have had too much learning and not enough poetic
inspiration to have been responsible for the faults
and fancies in William’s writings for the stage.
“S.S.”: Ever notice that the true coon on the stage
does not black-up, no matter what shade of yellow
he may be? When you see pitch darkies on the cor-
ners, you may be certain they are dead whites. An-
other manifestation of the mummer’s immemorial
dissatisfaction with things as they are—the sort of
tendency which impels comedians to play Hamlet and
open fruit shops; causes stout, bald men to mas-
querade as juveniles; and drives seat-holders of dis-
cernment jto the nearest pub.
“Vulcan” : The high wage curse again ! “The Pink
Lady,” after running to full houses for four months at
the London Globe, has just incontinently skied the
wipe. Mark Klaw, the producer of the show, explains
that, with Yankee chorus girls at anything from £5
to £8 per week, and the rest of the cast drawing
salaries in proportion, there is no money in musical
comedy under English conditions. The theatres are
too small, and the prices for seats too low. He hints
guardedly, that good business can only be done, in
this connection, by employing ladies at 30s. per week,
who are able to run Limousine cars, West End
maisonettes, maids and similar luxuries out of their
earnings. And the U.S. doesn’t seem to export large
consignments of this class of female goods.
London papers, reviewing the dramatic season
which came to a close in the middle of August, agree
that it fell considerably below the average in pros-
nerity. But the Daily Mail, extravagant in every-
thing, takes an unduly pessimistic’ view when it says
that “the losers came in battalions, scores of players
losing from one to ten thousand pounds apiece.”
There is certainly evidence of a slump in the long-
popular musical-comedy business. As the West-
minster Gazette remarks: “In nothing is the change
more clearly shown than in the musical pieces and
in the number of failures of works which a few
years ago would have made money.” Arnold Bennett
is acclaimed as “the most successful dramatist of
the year.” His “Honeymoon,” “Milestones” (writ-
ten in collaboration with the author of “Kismet”)
and “What the Public Wants” are all going strong.
Scotch comedy has achieved a prolonged success in
“Bunty Pulls the Strings,” which is nearing its
600th performance.
“Monkbarns”: It was in 1845 that Mr. and Mrs.
Coppin and their company came over from the London
Theatre, Launceston, per schooner Swan, to the
Melbourne Queen’s. The old house was owned by
Jacky Tommy Smith, Melbourne’s Whittington, who
was seven times Mayor. This civic person owned
the pub next door, a place of refreshment which is
selling beer even to this hour and minute. The
Queen’s had been opened three months before the Cop-
pins came. The first performance was by amateurs,
and the first professional company to show there was
the Nesbitt affair. Nesbitt plaved “The Bear
Hunters,” and followed it up with “Black Eyed
Susan.” Coppin’s company appeared to be all hus-
bands and wives. The old bills show a pair each of
Rogers, Youngs, Thomsons, Watsons and Hambel-
tons. There were no misses in the crowd., Megson
was orchestral director, and Opie scenic artist. The
show opened with the “Lady of Lyons,” and that
"'ad drama was followed by the “School for Scandal.”
Mrs. Young must have been very young indeed then.
She was a-daughter of the Thomsons, and the London
stage knew her as Mrs. Vezin.
TERRIBLE BURN ON PALM OF HAND.
“One night I struck a match and the whole box
went off in my hand, burning me across the palm,”
says Mr. J. R. Worseley, Margate (Tas.). “The
pain was awful. I went to the store and looked
round for something to relieve me. 1 saw Chamber-
lain’s Pain Balm, and noticed the word ‘burns’ on
the label. I rubbed it on my hand, with the result
that the pain quickly disappeared, and I was able to
go to sleep. In the morning I found the skin
whole, and the burn quickly healed without even
leaving a scar.”*
MARTIN-PLACE, SYDNEY-
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The crash of the cars, the scream of the horn and the
glimpse of a pretty face,
The sound of a hundred hurrying feet and a gleam
of ribbon and lace,
A pleasure-loving, pliable crowd, with a sense of
nothing to do,
A rollicking, scented, Southern breeze and a flutter
of gold and blue 1
A babel of voices loud and shrill, “Vi’lets and jon-
quils, Miss!”
And “Daffodils, a shillin’ the lot,” or “Sixpence a
bunch like this!”
A smile from a girl in a “sunshine” hat, with eyes
of a tender grey,
With the life and light and the spirit of Spring that
go to make up a day!
As a pa:an of praise for plenteous days and the joy
of life, from the tower
Fall the chimes and the mighty boom of the clock
proclaiming the mid-day hour.
The “clip-clap-clop” of a hansom cab and the creak
of a loaded van,
With a thousand undefinable sounds to gladden the
heart of man.
Oh! the crash of the cars, the scream of the horn
and the dust from hurrying feet,
The bustle and crush and noise to me are indescrib-
ably sweet!
Though I have journeyed in many lands, I vow there
was never a face
To compare with the girl’s who passes me by at the
corner of Martin-place !

IN BANANA LAND
W. L. Rodgers, maintenance engineer on
Bananaland’s Central Railway, died recently
at Rockhampton after 46 years of continu-
ous service. He never started a new reli-
gion, or ran a revolution, or chased the wild
ass in Persia, or caught whales with a rod
and line, or did battle with painted canni-
bals. But he helped to lay the first joint of
the great railway that now spreads out wesfi
trom Rockhampton to Longreach, and which
will spread further in days to come till it
joins on to the Port Augusta-Port Darwin
transcontinental and ropes in a whole heap
of western trade. So Rodgers was a useful
sort of pioneer in his day.
. Kobbi : A strange looking long-haired
individual, representing some religious sect,
is disturbing the monotony of Central
Queensland these days. He alleges that he
has been sent out (by parties not specified
and from some place which I badlv dis-
remember) to find the Lost Tribes of Israel
How Lost Israel came to Central Queens-
land is beyond my comprehension. The
apostle s wife does the canvassing from door
to door, and offers Pamphlets printed in an
amazing profusion of capitals on poor paper
I gave 2d. towards the finding of Israel!
though I have a mighty poor opinion of
any sort of Israel that can be found for 2d
i wouldnt even think much of an Israei
that could be found for lOd. These people
move from town to town on the vegetarian
ticket, and preach in the street with an
American accent. They are teetotal, and
avoid hotels,. but they accept, bed and tucker
trom Christian Endeavorers and such-like.
iJ j t l iey have a far-away expression—the
kind that people are liable to get through
always gazing over the plains in the hope of
seeing Israel on the horizon. My own idea
is that the kangaroos are the Lost Tribes.
They acquired the bounding habit while flee-
mg from their enemies, and the pouch is
what they used to put their money in.
On Strike.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Refusals to attend drill are becoming more fre-
quent every da daily.
A weedy youth of tender years was he,
In Khaki coat and Khaki bags arrayed.
The Girls would chaff him should they
chance to see
The figure quaint he made.
Our men refused the duties of defence;
Our, rulers backed their coward attitude;
And so this youngster, in his Pants im-
mense,
For something noble stood.
One thing at least this budding warrior
meant —
In all his rawness and his warlike gear;
Whene’er the foeman comes on Plunder
bent,
He’ll find a welcome here.
And so, while young men in their hefty
prime,
Dreamed in their dawdling way of sport
and fun.
This stripling did his duty to his clime
By marching with a Gun.
And We, his elders, thanked our lucky stars
The Kiddy did the goose-step for his dad ;
So that while grown-ups lingered round the
bars
The Land looked to the Lad.
It was, in truth, a paltry sort of game—
That stalwart men should loaf and drink
and toy
And leave, without the slightest pang of
shame,
Their duties to the Boy.
But now —another murmur travels round ;
. A whisper fraught with omen dark and
ill:
“Your coming force is but a cymbal-sound—
The Boy has dropped his Drill!”
And spineless rulers, cravens every one,
A Ministry of Milk and Mary Ann,
Decide: “If Jimmy wants to drop his gun
And spin his top—he can.”
And bearded men who hid wlren Country
called,
And stopped their ears to Duty’s loudest
claim,
Now listen to the news and find appalled—
The Boys have done the same.
So that Australia on her seagirt throne,
This message sends to alien vale and hill:
Ive failed to rear a Race that holds its

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 12, 1912.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
The Excellent Macgregor is still honking
through the backblox, admiring the cabbage
tree and the cabbage loyalty and other sur-
plus vegetables. He is expected back in Bris-
bane on Tuesday, when under-study Arthur
Morgan will hand over the blotting-pad,
rubber stamp and other implements where-
with vice-regalitv earns a crust.
On Thursday said A. Morgan, with
Paget, of the Railways, visited Lytton,
where the local branch of Australia’s kid
arrny has been perspiring under the weight
of its wooden popgun for the past fortnight.
All hands were found to be well and hearty
except the cook, who had blistered a finger
stirring the chicken broth.
Another consignment of bowlers has
reached us. This time they are from New-
castle (N.S.W.), where the Coal Vend
wasn’t born to blush unseen. They (the
bowlers) were fed at the Clayfield courts,
AN UNMANNERLY INTRUSION.
MILD GENT: " You might have had the decency to knock before entering .”
on Monday, by president Preston and wife.
Almost immediately afterwards, they
showed what they thought of the local team
by defeating it by 20 up and two to
go, or 15-6 and one for his nob, or some-
thing. On Wednesday night, at New Farm,
the Crimson Ramblers calmed the visitors
down with songandance, etc., and on Thurs-
day evening the Dandies carried on the
good intentions of the opposition show.
Monday evening found the tourists going
the whole animal at a euchre party, with
one Tyler, of Newcastle, in the lead. He
won the most games, and, in addition to
being awarded a prize for that, was over-
whelmed with a ham presented by John
Reid for the visitor who made the highest
score. The only trophy more inaopropriate
would have been a hindquarter of elephant
or “The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire.”
To-day Premier Digby Denham opened a
church bazaar in the Valley. [Name of
valley not mentioned, but no doubt it was
the same old valley of the Shadow of Debt.
—Ed.]
Penleigh Boyd, the* Victorian artist, and
Edith Anderson, of Brisbane, are to be
married in Paris next Wednesday.
Miss May Vivienne, once an actress of re-
pute, and now an authoress of tonnage, who
has already successfully placed two books
in the literature market, and is expecting a
third to leave the publisher in a few days,
is in Brisbane gathering copy for yet a
fourth.
Mrs. Holmes a’Court gave a coin and
competition tea at her Mary-street home on
Thursday, for the benefit of the District
Nurses’ Home. Lady Morgan, Premieress
Denham and the Mayoress were among
those who lavished silver on a good cause.
The Cambrian Choir lifted up its accumu-
lated voice at the Centennial Hall on Tues-
day. Tessie Mulcahy brought along her
deepest contralto notes as a special contri-
bution, and the large audience which filled
the hall pounded hob-nailed applause with
a lavish hand.
Mrs. Maggie McSweeney Moore played
here all this week, but did poor business.
For the first time since the tour began Mrs.
Mac and the twins failed in their appeal
to theatre-goers. Most of the spare cash
goes on the horse at this time of year, and
where Israel reapeth there shall the Gen-
tiles be stone-broke together.
The National Council of Women met yes-
terday, and listened politely to a paper,
read by one of its members, dealing with
the educational methods of Plato. No doubt
Plat’s methods are somewhat in arrears,
but I’ll lay two hat-skewers to a safety-pin
that his remarks would be right up to date
if he was introduced to a shemale who de-
sired to sub-edit Homer and carve the Iliad
in its tenderest places.
Charlie Turbayne, the popular Goondi-
windi bank manager, will pass the gold band
of matrimony to Fanny Rosendorff, one of
the musical clan, early in November. It is
not anticipated that the proceeding will
meet with any strenuous opposition.
Everybody’s backyard has been blown
away in the gale, and I subscribe myself,
Yours gloomily,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
M.L.A. Breslin, whose ups and downs
during the recent election were the wonder
of Bananaland, has just been repeating his
painful and varied experience before the
elections tribunal. One day saw Breslin
neck-and-neck with the enemy; next day
saw him one ahead ; the third day put them
level again until the assessors sensibly
agreed that the wisest thing was to put the
whole situation into the melting-pot again.
A fresh election consequently awaits Pt.
Curtis.
The upholders of the legend that the
Spaniards landed on the Queensland coast
centuries ago still struggle over the supposed
rums of a Spanish ship that are supposed to
have been once seen by somebody undefined
on the east coast of Facing Island or else-
where. Lately it was decided that the per-
son who saw the debris was Colin Archer,
and the date of his find was somewhere about
1856. But Colin Archer writes from Nor-
way to say that, though he was around in
1856, he found no Spanish wreck, and he
has no reason to believe that his brothers,
who were also around, did either. Nor does
he know of anybody else who did. So the
position apparently is that there are' no
records to show that these earlv Spaniards
ever came to Queensland, or that any of
them were wrecked there, and that nobody
has found any traces of them, or has any
reason to expect to do so either now or at
any other time.
Last week John Bell, Central Banana-
lands oldest inhabitant, gave up the hope-
less struggle to continue' living in a climate
which, as a matter of notorious fact, no
white man can stand. He was aged 82 at
the time, and had been battling with the
deadly conditions of the Northern State for
60 years. He took up country behind Glad-
stone when there was hardly anything to be
behind. Rockhampton hadn’t occurred
m those days, the time not being ripe, though
the Archers had settled in that inoffensive
but terribly dead locality-—Gracemere. Bell
made money, and had some stirring adven-
tures. He lent a hand to bury the Mount
Larcom folks who were slain by the niggers
v n ’•Jl“T one woman and three white men.
In 57 he helped to inter four more. De-
ceased remembered the Canoona rush, in
1858—an, event which led to a little gold
and some terribly bad poetry.
The Lazy Land.
“Locust” : The fragrant fisherman who says
that North Australia must be worked by the
gentleman with a dusky complexion and a
variegated handkerchief ought to look for
the results of the "awakening of the South
in the United States. The awakening
chiefly shows itself in the fact that the
white man has dropped on this: that he can
make more money by getting up and work-
ing himself than by sitting on a fence in a
white coat and watching a nigger work. We
in Australia, by the White Australia policy,
are determined to keep ourselves out of the
clutches of colored labor. In the Southern
States, the new policy is to emancipate the
white man from colored labor. All labor
employed in connection with cotton —the
Southern States’ staple—was colored a few
years ago. To-day, half the cotton is pro-
duced and handled by white men. In whole
tracts of Texas, cotton, sugarcane and rice
are worked exclusively by white labor. The
old theory that white men couldn’t work in
the fields of the South is knocked kite high.
It was a lie and a curse and an ass. They
can and do, and they make big profits, and
the prosperity of the formerly woe-begone
and nigger-infested South is advancing by
kangaroo leaps. The former failure of the
Southern States was the result of an idea
which permeated the country, viz., the idea
that the white man couldn’t work in the
fields in the tropical climate, while the black
man could. The ancient view was that the
way to make sugar or cotton pay was to
have a big plantation and a lot of niggers.
We once had the same delusion in Queens-
land. The cure in both cases was a realisa-
tion that the small, compact holding, worked
by the labor of the white owner, is better
than the big tract worked or loafed over by
the black serf. White men are getting better
results from their own labor in the Southern
States than under the old slave system or
the later black labor contract system. The
result upon the moral fibre of the “lazy
Southerner” has been to make him arise and
awake. Having left off depending on the
African, and started to do things himself,
the Southerner has made his country hum.
It is the first time it has hummed. He
sends 47 per cent, of the total exports of
the United States to foreign countries. He
produces £650,000,000 worth of grain, live
stock, vegetables and fruit; £670,000,000
worth of manufactured goods; £110,000,000
worth of forest products, and £70,000,000
worth of minerals. And all because he got
over the idea that Bruce Smith wants us
to adopt in Australia. Philip TCf,t,t, ar, an
eminent authority on the South, sums up
the change in the American Southern States
in this way :
One of the most serious handicaps the South has had to
overcome has been the almost universal belief that
her climate is a lazy man’s climate. That has pressed
clown upon and around her like a limiting band, to
keep her from making better use of her great natural
advantages and resources. A big step was taken to-
wards the loosening of this band when the old plan-
tation system began to be discarded, and the modern
system of small, compact, highly cultivated farms
was introduced. The lazy man’s country is where the,
lazy man is. The lazy man is disappearing rapidly
from the South, and with him is going the idea that
the South is a lazy land.
The miserable manipulation invented
under the Kidston-coalition rdgime of 1909,
wherebv a surplus of two or three hundred
thousand pounds is shown in the annual
statement as a surplus of £5OOO only, is
again alluded to by the Auditor-General.
His report says: “I would again bring
under the consideration of Parliament the
urgent, desirability of an amendment of the
Audit Act so as to require the Treasury
books to be finally closed on June 30 of each
year, leaving any outstanding expenditure
to be charged to the appropriation for such
outstandings, on the next year’s Estimates.”
Will the hint be taken? Not the least
danger.

PRELIMINARY NOTICE
Important Cattle Sale
BUSHY PARK STUD HEREFORDS,
KAI IWI, WANGANUI,
NEW ZEALAND.
'THIS FINE HERD was founded upon Mr. James
* Stuckey’s renowned TE RANGITUMAU HERD.
It has even been still further improved from time to
time by importations from the best strains of Great
Britain. Its present owner, Mr. FRANK MOORE,
can confidently claim that it is unrivalled in the
Australasian Colonies for EVENNESS OF TYPE,
CONSTITUTION, EARLY MATURITY, and GRAND
RICH DARK COLOR.
The whole of these FAMOUS CATTLE are to be
sold by PUBLIC AUCTION in APRIL, 1913.
ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT RESERVE.
The Sale is a Genuine Clearing one, and is NOT
merely a reduction for culling purposes.

five Heifer Calves this season.
29 HEIFERS, two-years-old. They will be in calf
at time of sale.
23 HEIFERS, yearlings.
5 COWS, old, in calf.
These latter are the only OLD cows in the lot.
The foregoing constitute an aggregate of
203 FEMALE STUD HEREFORD
CATTLE.
To this total must be added a
LARGE NUMBER OF STUD BULLS
of different ages. The majority of these will be rising
two years at time of sale.
These MAGNIFICENT CATTLE are practically all
eligible for entry in the ENGLISH HERD BOOK,
and they will be in splendid condition when sold.
The Sale of the BUSHY PARK STUD HERE-
FORDS is a unique opportunity for New Zealand

The Japanese may have spots of western
varnish upon him, but underneath he is the
same old Jap. Thus a petition is being
largely signed among the brown people for
presentation to the late Mikado’s physician
asking him to kindly commit suicide.
Europe couldn’t understand that point of
view, but it seems quite natural to Eastern
Asia.
The N.S.W. Redistribution of Seats Bill,
which was to have been passed a year ago
so that Parliament might promptly dissolve
and go to the country, as per Holman’s
agreement with Speaker Willis, is not to
the fore yet, and there is a suspicion that
it won’t appear this session. After all, it
matters very little. It is becoming so diffi-
cult to remember any pledge that the
McGowen Government hasn’t broken that
nothing it can do will make its political
character much worse. And there isn’t
time now to do anything that will make its
political character look much better.
Rev. Dr. Rentoul, of Melbourne, de-
nouncing the Australian defence system be-
fore the General Presbyterian Assembly the
other evening, demanded passionately: “Why
should Lord Roberts be quoted? A military
man is a military man.” True, and a par-
son is a parson. Each man is supposed to
know something of his own business. Roberts
doesn’t give Rentoul advice about how to
save Australia from the Devil. Rentoiil, un-
less he can show better qualifications than
he has done, shouldn’t be so wildly cock-
sure that he knows best how to save Aus-
tralia from the Asiatic.
So far, the Northern Territory is struggling
along, not only without a railway, uui a±su
without an immigration policy and a land
policy. The Fisher Government’s first idea
re land was perpetual leasehold, with so
many possibilities in the way of reappraise-
ment of. rent at. almost any moment that
the thing looked more like a weekly tenure.
It was pointed out to the said Government
that it was trying to impose on its tenant
harder terms than those of private Fat, and
a Government which thought it could screw
more out of its tenants than Fat did was
too sanguine for this world. So the pro-
posed arrangement was dropped. As nothing
has taken its place, the White Elephant
State which would be a beautiful and
profitable elephant if it only had half a
chance —is still very much where it was.
And that is away at the back of the north
wind, on the edge of nowhere, with Ala-
hornet s coffin for company.
“Mr. Justice Ocky” writes :
Victorian policemen have been lingering with theii
jobs in the hope that Watt, in his Budget proposals,
would announce better things for the future. The
Budget has come, and wich it a despairing groan
from the force; for the extra 6d. a day promised,
as from January first, MIS, will still leave these in-
telligent, strong and zealous people with shockingly
had pay and conditions. Once the pride of the place,
the Hops of Victoria have been deteriorating for a
long time, until .now they are the most inanimate
and utterly full-up crowd in all Australia. No
reasonable person nowadays would expect to purchase
intelligence, brawn and zeal at 7s. 6d. a day, yet
that is what the Watt Government is asking. Good
men are gradually going out, and in their place the
service has been getting mostly an undersized, small-,
tooted, dont-care brand of policeman. Watt's Bud?
get was a sorry thing from a police point of view,
there was no provision for pensions to the younger'
men, and the proposal that a hundred or so more*
policemen are to be put on (at 7s. 6d. a day) is a
joke, for they won’t be offering unless the physical
and educational requirements are further reduced.
Let Watt alter the height qualification to sft., chest
measurement to 23in., and knock out the education
test—then he might get a few. A sergeant at Gee-
long didn t wait for the Budget. Probably he had
inside information about it, and, worried by his‘
tedious work, he scattered his brainsi'dn the day be-
fore Watt rose to give his speech in the House. It
was a hint.
Slowbart published some time
ago a letter from a Kerristian Fusionist re
tile Maternity Bonus. It was a profoundly
toolisli letter which, after alluding to rife
profligacy and Divine decrees, went on to
say, “It appears that the Federal Labor
Government intends to deliberately en-
courage degenerate men and women to
continue in their debauchery.” Such

“Looking Backward”: Victorian Geologist.
Dunn has prepared for the Mines Depaßt-
non ° n big: nu^ets - It slioAs
that Id ot IOOOoz. gross and over are known
to have been found in Victoria. Dunn con-
siders that only half the finds of nuggdts
were recorded. “Conditions in the early davs
were sometimes such as to make it more
prudent for discoverers of rich nuggets to
keep their finds secret.” This recalls al
least a dozen stories of Ballarat nuggets hav-
ing been sawn in halves and quarters, and
then rediscovered as smaller and less sensa-
L on /l mas^ es . ln wi dcly scattered places, so
that, the digging public might not be “nut.'
wise. The best nugget was the 28440 z
spec or germ unearthed at Dunoliy. in ’57.
Ihe average of the 15 .recognised monsters
was 16,0f0z The Sarah Sands, from
Ciinadian Gully, Ballarfet, in ’53, and an-
other from the Same place in the same year
started the biggest of Ballarat booms. They
also started a controversy in England as to
the origin of the word nugget. From the
periodical literature of the day I find that
the consensus of opinion was that it was a
Corruption of ingot. If this were so, the
Australian digger did not corrupt the word
for in Roger North’s life of Sir Dudley
North, published in 1750, occurs the words:
“There was a marvellous great mass of trea-
sure in niggots of gold.” But “nugget” did
not become current as a word until the Aus-
tralian discoveries. Before that time news-
papers in England used to print it between
apologetic quotation marks.
“Singemoine” : I used to imagine fondly
that the female’s alleged lack of reasoning
power was a fiction invented by the manu-
facturer of jokes for the cheaper comic jour-
nals of the United Kingdom. Apparently I
erred. The disability would seem really to
exist, and in stark defiance of mature years
and the careful intellectual training which,
presumably. accompanies great wealth.
Consider the following from last Friday’s
Sydney Telegraph ;
Miss Eadith Walker is not a supporter of the
proposal to erect an expensive monument to Shak-
sveare. In a letter read at the memorial com-
mittee’s meeting she remarked that both her time
and resources were at present freely engaged. “You
express a hope,” she wrote, “that the memorial to be
raised may be worthy of the city. . . .In the 'present
state of Sydney the money would be far more use-
fully employed in improving and cleansing its
streets.”
What a priceless sample of feminine incon-
sequence ! She will not subscribe to the
Shakspeare memorial because the streets
are dusty. In the same spirit I propose,
when next I am importuned for a small
silver coin at a bazaar or what-not, to
decline on the grounds that the Putamayo
horrors still continue and the scrap between
the Unspeakable Turk and the Hurried
Dago rages unabated. And the next per-
son who essays to touch me for a hospital
subscription will edge off discomfited, with
the intimation ringing in liis ears that the
thing is impossible owing to the unclothed
state of the heathen in Nigeria, combined
with the persistent tendency of the baser
sort of citizen to become blithered on'public
holidays. The main advantages of this
class of repartee are (1) the countless
changes that are capable of being rung on
■jt’, ( 2 ) the stunning, and in fact almost
lethal, effect which the wild unexpectedness
of it produces on the coin-seeker.
Sydney Telegraph lately, in its financial
column, preached a sermon, with Canada
as its text, on the blessings of High Pro-
tection. Between 1900 and 1910, it stated,
the number of Canadian factories increased
by f3l per cent.) ; employees by i
1f2,6<1 (51 per cent.) ; value of work done
per year by £71,266,731 (163 per cent.) ;
while the avei-age wages per employee (men,
women, boys and girls all included) rose
from £6B 3s. to £96 Is. per annum. There
seem to be points about these figures some-
where. Low-tariff Australia can show
nothing to equal them.

ALBERT SON, 137*9 King Street, Sydney
ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
I?
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
.can.

HER LITTLE GIRL’S
HAIR ALL CAME OFF
Trouble Like Ringworm. Very Itchy.
Could Not Sleep. Tried a Lot of
Remedies to No Avail. Had Not
Used One Pot of Cuticura Oint-
ment Before She Was Cured.
“The trouble that affected my little girl
started in her head like ringworm Then it
went all over her head.
The head swelled and it
went in the l'orm of mat-
ter and all the hair came
off her head. It was very
itchy. She could not
sleep, and I began to
think she would never
get better. I tried a lot
of advertised remedies,
but all to no avail. She
was like this for over
three months until I
tried a pot of Cuticura
Ointment. I had not
used that pot. before she
was completely cured. The hair grew again,
and you would never know that there had
been anything wrong with her head.”

If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
*' half*' will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIQ STIR AMONG HAIR SPECIALISTS.
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Orowing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed' growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair On my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

“Lantana”: Some people have all the luck. Re-
cently one Corduroy was spinning along on his motor-
cycle on the Parkes-road, Wellington way (N.S.W.),
when he fell and broke his leg. He was discovered
by a good motoring Samaritan and taken to the
hospital. But that wasn’t the point. Corduroy had
taken out an accident policy the previous day for
the first time in his life. The accident insurance co.
doesn’t see the finger of Providence in the business,
but Corduroy does.
From a recent S. M. llehald :
“WANTED, Good General, light house work,
one who can play piano pref., four boarders,
wages 10s.”
The sloppy carelessness of these advertisers! There
is no hint as to whether a Wagnerian Marianne or
one with a profound knowledge of (say) Brahms, will
have the better chance of snaring the 10 bob a week
job.
“Werrimee”: While the bush has the sundowner, the
city has the sundown woodman. Just when night is
setting in there is a great disturbance at the back
cate. The ladv. going out, finds a seedv-lookin"- in-
dividual contemplating a melancholj' moke, which is
attached to a wheeled relic of ye olden times, and
lamenting his misfortunes, lie has a barrowful of
wood in the cart, the tailboard is down, and some of
the firing material is spilled on the road. He has a
pitiful tale to tell, this man, and he tells it better
than Bland Holt. The wood was intended for a
party two blocks away, but his horse is knocked up,
and he wants to get home, so he will sell the lot
dirt cheap. “It’s real good dry box, lady. Look at
it!” He almost shoves some of it into her arms.
“I’m losing on it, lady, honor bright,” he adds,
while there is a pathetic, appealing look in his
eves. “If it it, wasn’t that I’m fair done in, an’ the
horse is dead beat an’ won’t pull another yard, I
wouldn’t sell it. As I said, I’ve a customer waitin’
for it.” She hesitates for a moment, then remem-
bers that she Jias been taken in before in after-dark
wood-dealing, and tells him that she has just bought
some from Ms brother. As the gate closes b« straightens
up his outfit, takes hold of the reins, and the knocked-
up horse walks straight away. He is a by-product,
this sundown woodman, for it’s sundown before he
starts out.
“Carmine”: The prices given by millionaires for
pictures in the first seven months of this year make
it seem pretty good business to be a dead artist or a
descendant of the early patrons, duns or thieves, who
acquired his canvases cheap. Six Rembrandts
fetched £59,590; 13 Corots, £64,180; 14 Raeburns,
£70,981. One Turner brought £25,800, and the
top price, £29,500, was paid for a Mantegna.
Rembrandt touched £19,800 for one, and last year
that artist’s picture, “The Mill,” brought £lOO,OOO.
There is a commercial side to Art after all, and even
the combined genius of Mclntosh, Johnson and
McVea could hardly devise, arrange or create a mill
which would bring the price of Rembrandt’s.
“George Street”: They have a nice little cash
saving device in the Vienna streets which is going
to be given a trial in Paris. Anybody who has a
penny about him is invited to drop it in a penny-
in-the-slot machine, and draw out a receipt for the
coin. The receipts can be turned into cash again
by application at a Government Department. The
idea is cheerful, and many a soul sorely tempted to
part with a brown which he ought to take home to
buy coals or dresses or a piano or something, may
be saved from frightful extravagance by the sight
of the slot which rescues him from himself. All
the same, unless the Austrian Government is a
particularly uncertain proposition financially, it
looks as if three of the bits of paper drawn from the
machine would buy a pint of beer just as readily
as three brown counters which had been duly minted.
What is really wanted is a machine which would col-
lect the penny and add it to a cash account, from
which only the butcher, baker, grocer, piano man,
laundry and other allegedly useful, and always in-
sistent, people could be paid. Personally, I" think
there should be two sorts of money, one of which
would not be legal tender for beer, stout, oysters,
crayfish, supper, theatre tickets, church collections,
charities, whisky, bets, borrowers, ice-creams or
anything at all savoring of the world, the flesh and
Zoroastrianism. If a penny-in-the-slot contrivance
would yield a currency proof against all forms of joy,
it would be a boon to many persons not specially
prone to Wqwserism in its most fatal form.
THE BEAUTY CANVASSER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The faint and weary organ ground
Its barrel music to the day,
The varied dust a lodging found
Within my whirling whiskers gay,
The tram-cars with a heavy sound
Clanged bells to scare delight away.
A restless, breezy, moving noon,
All wheels were turning in the street,
Nor wight nor damsel paused to spoon,
But went hard-eyed on rapid feet,
As if they knew that very soon
The lunching world must pause to eat.
And here and there some dripping beer,
Dank from the cask, went swiftly down
Some throat that seemed as hot and sere
As love beneath a Wowser’s frown,
When all the tortured hemisphere
Is grey except where it is brown.
A sordid place the city lay,
Full as of breath of elder pork
Breathed by cold duns I could not pay,
I seemed as with a knife and fork
To feast on slabs of toasted hay
All intermixed with coke and cork.
And then wind-whisked you softly came,
Blown on the sportive zephyr’s breast,
A large pink rose without a name
Lying upon your hat at rest,
And all your feet with languor tame,
And all your beauty featly drest.
I think it is a feat to care
For frills and lace on days like this,
And dainty clothing wrought to snare
The heart in strands of silken bliss—
I would that I had naught to wear
Except a single rosy kiss.
(Provided that the kiss were yours,
Lent me for hot and sure return)
Though such a uniform insures
A maximum of bite and burn,
Being so airy that it lures
Woes that a covered hide might spurn.
Which does not in the least imply
That such a kiss was ever mine,
Although I looked you in the eye,
And felt my happy soul entwine
With dreams of yours so sweet and shy
They seemed like roses drowned in wine.
But you are gone, and all I hold
Is just this paper left with me,
The little thing a piece of gold
Caused thus to flutter soft and free,
The fateful ticket that you sold
Inscribed with four eights and a three.
If I should win the highest prize
I should achieve no sudden pile
Of cash, for I am somewhat wise
In matters of Art Union guile;
But for the picture in your eyes
I paid, because I won a smile.

CONSTIPATION CONQUERED.
There lies the vital secret where so many diseases and ailments are
concerned — Constipation must be conquered, or normal organic action,
freedom from liver and kidney troubles, and from stomach and bowel
disorders, is not possible.
Cockle’s Pills conquer Constipation of the most stubbornly aggressive
kind; because they strengthen and stimulate and revivify the organs,
which they cleanse and regulate with such consummate ease and efficiency.
The whole system is freed from the wholesale disturbance due to the con-
stipated tendency, from blood impurities, from effete matter, from lurking
disease. Yet Cockle’s Pills act so gently and pleasingly that the most
delicate persons like them.

LOOK OUT for
SPRINC DANCERS
NOW is the time to be on the “look=out” for the dangers of Spring-
dangers from within as well as from without. A besieged fortress
after a long siege is not only more watchful of danger from attack
by an enemy without, but also of danger from weakness within. The
human system, after the long siege of Autumn and Winter, is weakened
through over=work—overwork of all the digestive organs which have had
to cope with the extra food consumed (a necessity during the cold months),
and over=work caused by resisting the attacks of colds and chills. The
weakened system is less able to withstand the renewed attacks of the
changes of temperature, and must be toned up. There is no tonic like
Bile Beans, because they are purely vegetable, and assist the over=
worked organs to cope with the demands of Nature and gradually
restore them to their normal condition, so that they are again able—
unaided—to perform their natural functions. With the system so
toned=up you can withstand the many dangers that lurk in the Spring=time.
Mrs. E. E. Johns, of Victoria Street,
Lewisham, Sydney, says: —“Bile Beans are
an ideal Spring medicine, and a box of them
should be in every home. I have used Bile
Beans for myself and family for years, and
can highly recommend them. A friend of
mine, residing in Victoria, first sent me a box
of the Beans some years ago, and now I
would not be without them in the house. I
have a large family, and at Spring-time and
other changes of season, give them Bile
Beans, which ensure their good health.”
THE BEST SPRING MEDICINE.
Bile Beans are a proved remedy for biliousness, headache, Indigestion, stomach troubles,
constipation, piles, debility, female ailments, nervousness, bad blood, bad breath, aneemia, dis-
turbed sleep, loss of appetite, Spring ailments, and, in fact, all ailments that owe their origin
to defective liver action. Obtainable everywhere at Is. IJd., or 2s. 9d. large box (containing three
times the Is. I£d. size); or o"st free from thr hur Bean Mfg. Company, 39 Pitt Street, Sydney.

THE
QUESTION of the DAY.
The question of to-day,
of to-morrow and of
every succeeding day is
HAVE YOU USED PEAKS’ SOAP ?
If yon have not, you have not
done your duty by your sßin and
complexion. If* on the other hand
that is, on both hands, and on the
face, and on the sßin generally—you
HAVE used PEARS, you can feel
happy, for you will have done the
best that possibly can be done tor
the skin’s health and beauty. There
can be no question about that.
PEARS has been making beautiful
complexions for nearly 120 years.
PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion.
The Consolations of If and But.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM lying here, with my eyes half shut,
By the side of a large lagoon,
While Memory sings of her if and but
To the lisp of the water’s tune,
And the small night breezes come to cut
The hair of the silver moon.
If things were but as they might have been
In the days of long ago,
If only my eyes the path had seen,
Or I had not been too slow,
Sure 1 had walked in pastures green
With all that a life may grow.
I have held the corkscrew in my hand
The corks of the world to pull,
On the bridge of joy I’ve been known to stand
When the breeze of delight blew cool,
And all things fair were at my command,
If I had not been such a fool.
But youth has a rate of cent, per cent.
That life must make shift to pay,
And we go not again by the way we went
When the morn was young and gay ;
When the lights are out and the wine is spent
We mock at the feast and play.
I want to think of a girl asleep
’Neath the boughs of an apple tree,
When the blossom fell to the winds a-sweep
In a springtime of Arcady—
Oh, that were a prize to hold and keep
If she had but dreamed of me.
I want the kisses I might have known,
And the glasses I might have quaffed;
But I lie in the night and dream alone
While the breezes round me waft
The tale of the joys I used to own,
And the laughs that I might have laughed.
But I know when the whole of the game is
played,
And the reckoning made complete,
There is glad beer waiting in some cool
shade,
And a fish that is good to eat;
And a pleasant smile from a dimpled maid
With a young waist slim and neat.
If I missed in the time of dew and dawn
When the newsboys wake to shout,
A bow at a venture somewhere drawn
Has found some gladness out;
And the oyster sings to the rosy prawn
Its lyric of turn about. : ■ •
If things were but as they might have been
In the days of long ago,
Perhaps I had found life pale and mean,
And her pathway brown and slow ;
If my heart had all that my eyes have see'.!,
What were left me to win or know?
But I lie out here, with my eyes half shut.
By the side of a large lagoon,
And I thank the world for its if and but
To the lisp of the water’s tune,
While the small night breezes snip and cut
The hair of the silver moon.

CURSE O' MOSES.
Carrie.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
L 'j HORTLY after we moved our bachelor
Elysium to Woollahra Point we struck
trouble. Balm’s mother, our house-
keeper, became so ill that an ambulance took
her off to the hospital, and we six distracted
bloques held a frantic meeting of the Board to
decide what on earth we should do with Babe.
Rice rose to the occasion. He wired that
he would not be in that day, and with Babe
on his arm started for the local Registry
Office. Needless to say he found no one there
he could trust Babe with, and he set out on
a round of inquiry among the neighbors, with
gratifying result. When we came racing
home that night to relieve him of Babe
while he got a shave and made himself pre-
sentable for dining at a cafe, we found him
strolling round with Babe on his arm as
usual, and inside, gliding from room to room,
a neat, grey-eyed, demure young woman,
named Carrie, ready to serve dinner.
As President, I considered it my duty to
convene a brief meeting, and place on the
records of the Honorable Order of Bloques
our appreciation of the great services ren-
dered the brotherhood and humanity by our
distinguished colleague, Evan Rice? Bloque
Rice replied feelingly, and gave an interest-
ing summary of his searchings and wander-
ings, after which the President declared the
meeting closed, and Carrie brought in the
soup.
“She’s got a face like a Madonna!” sighed
Joseph the Canaanite. “If I wasn’t en-
gaged to Rebecca- —well, never mind.”
“She is a lovely cook!” said Morley the
draughtsman, opening up a sweetbread pat£.
“Yes,” murmured Rice, slipping a care-
fully-bearded oyster into Babe’s mouth, “we
must certainly give the permanent house-
keeper a good, long holiday. We might
manage to get another couple of fellows to
join and keep ’em both after a while. This
pate is just heavenly.”
“Me too !” said Babe.
“Think some of the juice would hurt her,
President?” inquired Rice.
“Lord, yes! You ought to know that, con-
sidering the crowd of kids vou’ve had.”
But the Babe had dipped one russet-tipped
finger into the dish, and was regarding the
extremity with a look of shocked curiosity.
“She doesn’t like it, thank God,” remarked
Garstin, helping himself to the last of the
spare pates.
“I suppose, President, we’ll have to get
this girl some assistance with Babe?” said
Rice, putting down his empty glass.
“If we don’t, the cooking will surely go off.
I’ve been thinking we want another girl in
the house for some time. Babe and the
house are too much for one woman.”
“There’s plenty for a girl to do,” con-
tinued Rice. “She could look after Babe
while Carrie was doing the cooking, assist
in repelling hawkers, act as housemaid, and
lots of other things. I don’t think Carrie
could have got through if I hadn’t been here
to mind Babe, and she is real good with
Carrie too.”
And then the demure, grey-eyed little
woman floated in with iced asparagus and
artistic dressing. She seemed shy, timid,
and glad to get out of the room.
“Very retiring sort of girl,” Rice went on.
“ ‘Sirs’ you in every sentence. We’ll never
have any trouble in the way of exercising
our authority—she’s humility personified.”
“I have noticed,” said Morley, “that people
who have those.,,humble, retiring natures al-
ways, have a forward stoo]/ probably caused
by art unconscious hanging of the head. Now
you just notice Carrie when R^e r .^ ri °^ t s , 1
the next course, whatever it is. Or, ratne ~
notice her as she goes out.
Two minutes later Carrie appeared with a
couple of roast ducks, and retired m contu-
sion, owing to the fact that every bloque
was watching her under his eyebrows, and
those who had their backs to her were watch-
ing her in the mirror of the dinner waggon.
Morley’s remark was quite correct she had
a distinct forward stoop. _
That night we boozed up Rice considerably
to show our appreciation of the girl he had
got. As a chooser of housekeepers he was a
man to be respected. Her undeniable good
looks, her genius for cooking, her quiet,
almost humble, ways, soft grey eyes and
Madonna-like face impressed us all very
much. Sometimes we wished that she was
not quite so humble and retiring.
Next day, as President, I instructed her to
go to the registry office and choose herself an
understudy, or assistant, or whatever she
liked to call the girl. Wages not to exceed
10s. per week. Carrie _ thought eight would
be enough—she explained that she only
wanted a young, untrained girl to mind Babe
while she was herself engaged, and do purely
mechanical work. The President gave her
a free hand, and when we came home that
night we found a sheepish-looking.young girl,
who answered the name of Mollie, nursing
Babe in a deferential manner in the front
garden.
* * * *
When the President arrived home one
afternoon, about a fortnight later, he noticed
that Rice was not in the garden as usual,
carrying Babe round on his left arm, while
he manipulated a hose sprinkler with his
right hand. He ascribed this neglect of cus-
tom to the heat, which was insufferable,
and paused in the shade of the pepper tree to
breathe a prayer that the bloques had not
absorbed all the whisky and soda. He knew |
he could rely upon Carrie for ice, if there
was anything left to put the ice into. Then
he noticed also that the nose of Joseph, son
of Abraham, was not in its accustomed place
oyer the carnation bed, which he claimed as
his. exclusive property. Through the open
dining-room window he caught a glimpse of
the head of Morley, the draughtsman, and if
seemed to have a droop about it.
The President felt a sudden premonition
of evil. Regardless of his fat, which was
considerable, he broke into the curious, ac-
celerated sort of waddle that he dignified by
the name of a run. On the verandah, under
the wistaria, unbuttoning his waistcoat, he
found a tail man and burly, with cheerful
blue eyes, shaggy straight hair and whiskers
and a very red face. In spite of his uncon-
ventionality, his profession was stamped
large all over him. The President gripped
him by the arm.
“What’s up, Doctor—what brings you
here ?”
“The little kid inside —she’s not too well !”
“Good Heavens! Is it anything serious?
I hone she hasn’t been choked, or”-
“Don’t fly off the handle like that, man.”
said the Doctor kindly. “Something has
disagreed with her; consequence, a touch of
gastritis, and that ridiculous open-work lace
bonnet fitting close over her head, a touch of
the sun.”
“Come inside, man, come inside. T want
to. hear everything that is to be done. Babe
with sunstroke —oh, good Lord ! What care-
less devil”
“Look here,” snorted the doctor, “you’re
worse than a woman. You’re the worst of
the lot. Every time I try to get away from
this blessed house I meet one of you on the
verandah, and the same scene hanoens again.
How many of you are there, in the name of
God ?
“Seven. Come inside ; till I see the Babe!”
“Keep quiet. Babe is asleep. I’ve given
her some powders to stop the sickness; and
if she can sleep she will be right in a
couple of days. But I’m afraid that the I
touch of the sun will keep her awake, and
spoil her rest generally.”
“Well, you’ve given her powders. What
then? What’s she got to eat, and what
mustn’t she eat?”
“Well, you’re a sensible sort of lunatic,
anyhow. No solid food for a week. A
little iced water, milk food only for two days,
and then you might let her have a little
meat juice. But that young lady nursing
her is primed with all the instructions.”
“Well, you’ve eased my mind. Come inside
and have a cooler !”
“No, I’ve had five already, and might catch
cold if I had any more, and I want to get
away before the seventh man comes in, or
I’ll have to explain it all over again, and
I’m getting tired. Besides, I might get
mixed, and then my renutation would be
gone. I’ll come in to-morrow and have an-
other look at her. I see a man coming down
the road, so I’ll get away—he might be the
seventh.”
Inside, the President went straight to
Babe’s bedroom, which was, incidentally, that
of Carrie also. The door was ajar, and he
tapped lightly and looked in. Babe was in
her cot, and Carrie sitting beside her, fan-
ning her with one hand, and wiping her own
eyes with the other. The President stepped
over, and looked steadfastly in the face of
the black-haired infant. It had lost its
beautiful russet tint, and was white as the
pillow on which she lay. Only her little
mouth looked like a crushed flower at the
lower point of it.
“How did it happen?” whispered the
President.
Rut Carrie waved him towards the door,,
and, softly drawing the curtains over the
cot. followed him out.
“She has been very ravenous for solid food
lately. I give her chicken and mutton
broth, also rusks soaked in it. but she didn’t
seem satisfied. So I made her some little
sponge cakes and kept them for a couple of
days to make them nice and dry. Yester-
day and to-day I sent Mollie out to buy some
from the confectioner’s, and the woman down
there makes a great fuss of her, and, it
seems, gave her lollies and caraway-seed
cakes. Mollie apparently knows nothing
about babies, and let her have these things,
and, of course, gastritis set in. However,
that is not the worst. Coming home from
the confectioner’s Mollie neglected- to hoist
her brolly, and Babe got a slight sunstroke.
That’s the last straw. 1 feel inclined to
send Mollie away, but it seems to me that,
now it has happened, and she has had the
fact that she must look after Babe better
brought home to her, I had better keep her.”
“I think so, too!” said the President, won-
dering where Carrie’s alleged humilitv had
gone tot She had suddenly acquired the
importance of the nurse.

DO YOU FEEL LIKE GIVING UP?
Does your back ache constantly ? Do you feel dull, miserable
and tired all the time ? Do you wonder why ordinary daily duties
wear you out ? Do you have “ blue ” days and restless nights ?
Kidney sickness silently plays out the strongest person. A
dull, draggy ache in the small of the back will tell on the healthiest
man or woman. And if the kidneys fail in their task of filtering
uric acid poisons from the blood, it leads to painful attacks of
neuralgia, rheumatism, sciatica, gravel, headaches —to worrying
attacks of dizziness, nervousness, heart palpitation, scanty,
painful and too frequent urination.
Don’t neglect weak kidneys. There is danger of running
gradually into dropsy, Bright’s Disease or diabetes. At the first sign
of backache or disorders of the urine, use Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. A remedy that has cured your neighbors will cure you.
Proved by SYDNEY Testimony.
Mrs. K. Helmka, 27 Ada Street, Pyrmont, Sydney,
says: “About thirteen years ago I caught a severe
cold, which flew to the small of my back, and seemed
to affect my kidneys. My back was lame, and when
cold weather set in the pain would be dreadful. When
I worked at the sewing machine, my back ached
worst, and I could never stay at it for any length of
time. Having a large family to sew for made it very
hard for me. I heard of Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, and sent for some. Relief came almost imme-
diately I started to use them, and now my cure is
perfect. I am pleased to recommend these pills to
all kidney sufferers.”
Thirteen years after the above was given, Mrs.
Helmka says: “I have seen the above statement ap-
pearing in the papers. It is quite true, and my cure
has stood the test of time, for I have been free from
backache and kidney trouble for the last thirteen
years.”
Mrs. L. May, 34 Wilson Street, Redfern, Sydney,
says: “For seven years I suffered torture from back-
ache. I could not get about to do my work, and to
bend my back was dreadful agony, and it was impos-
sible for me to straighten up after stooping without
assistance. My rest was disturbed, for I could not
lie in one position for more than a few minutes on
account of the pain. Remedy after remedy failed me,
and I could not get anything to even relieve me I used
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and four bottles cured
me ; I have no ache or pain now. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are marvellous.”
When asked about her cure five years later, Mrs.
May says: “Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills perfectly
cured my aching back, for it is five years since I used
this remedy, and I have had no sign of the ailment
since.”

An hour later Babe suddenly
with a scream, in fact. The bloques rushed
in, and found Carrie walking up and down
with Babe’s head resting against her shoul-
der. They spoke to her, but Babe ignored
them all, and clung wailingly to Carrie’s
faded blouse.
“I think you are disturbing her—she has
to be kept very quiet,” said Carrie, severely.
“Would one of you kindly tell Mollie to turn
the sirloin and put the ice on the aspara-
gus?” she inquired, without the slightest
trace of nervousness. The bloques took one
reproachful look at Babe’s agate eyes shin-
ing under the long lashes, and then slunk
out.
“That girl’s manner has changed im-
mensely,” said Rice when we got out on to
a ea * u P. < ? er the broadleaf tree.
‘ Seems hke another woman! said Joseph,
<< T i> aa s? nlte L i •, • . T
Its the maternal side coming out, I sup-
cb imed in Money. ... ..
The doctor says that when she is well
she must go away on a farrn somewhere
higher up, and get over the effect ot that
touch of the sun, said Joseph. We 11 have
T?. ba q Ve a meeting of the Board about it,
f resident.
By Sunday morning Babe was sufficiently
recovered to make the question of her going
away current. The Board met in the dining-
room and the President after calling order
several times, summarised the position
“Honorable members of the Order of
Bloques will remember that the physician
has ordered Babe away for a change. The
city is full of measles, scarlatina and other
damned things that tackle babies when
they’re weak. The question is, who is Babe
to go with. Her mother cannot leave the
hospital, nor is she likely to do so for weeks
.vet.”
“The Honorable President is wrong,” said
Rice. “Babe is not going with anyone; the
question is who is to go with Babe?”
“Rats!” retorted the President.
When the President had succeeded in re-
storing order, he resumed his interrupted dis-
course :
“It seems to me that Babe must have an
attendant to whom she is attached, and the
only person who fills the bill is Carrie.
That’s as clear as mud. On the other hand,
if Carrie goes away, who is to look after us?
WE must be taken care of! That requires
no demonstration. Mollie is over-young, and
it seems to me that in the light of past ex-
perience we had better leave the engaging
of the substitute to Brother Rice.”
“Leave it to Carrie; she’s more likely to
strike a good one than I. Babe had better
start immediately this substitute is ob-
tained.”
“I’ll tell you what,” said Joseph the
Hebrew.” we’ll have to fix up Carrie’s ward-
robe a bit. If we send her to a swell farm
with our joint and several baby, it is up
to us to see that she is properly dressed, so
that she can hold her head up with the best
of them. It will not conduce to Babe’s rapid
recovery if her nurse is in a constant state
of nervous irritation about her clothes.”
“Quite right!” said Morley. “And we
must make a real howling swell of Babe, too.
Our babs must be as good as the best; in
fact, she ought to be better. Other kiddies
have only one father, and perhaps brothers
and sisters; our baby has seven fathers, and
it would seriously reflect on the reputation
of the Order if she wasn’t a real howling
little toff.”
“1 agree with the two last speakers,” said
Brother Garstin. “And I further move that
the Honorable President, who is an autlior-
ity on ladies’ clothing and frills, should, with
Brothers Rice and Josephs, form themselves
into a committee to make the purchases. I
understand there is a great sale on now at
Mark Tart’s. The cost, of course, to be
charged to the expenses of the Order.”
“I’ll move as an amendment that the
Order form itself into a committee of the
whole to do that purchasing,” expostulated
the President. “I don’t even know the names
0 f all the things that they wear.”
But on division the amendment was lost,
and the p reside nt, Rice and Josephs found
themselves let in for the purchasing. Later
on they approached Carrie surreptitiously,
and, handing over a number of sovereigns,
t o i d ber to get what was necessary, and have
sen (- cardboard boxes to the President’s
o fii ce .
Two days later the President telephoned
to Rice and Joseph to come and help him
carry the packages home. Carrie had gone
j n b j„ ii c k s
“Let’s do the thing in style!” said the
President “Divide the lot into three
divisions, and let each man take his own
home in a separate cab, and that’ll make the
other fellows think we each did it on our
own.”
When the cabs arrived at Elysium in a
procession an hour later, the rest of the
bloques came down and helped to cart the
packages into the house. As they entered
they heard the voice of Carrie complaining,
She was afraid that after all she wouldn’t
be able to get away. The potatoes weren’t
fit to eat, and the French beans were a dis-
grace, and the sooner decent domestic ser-
vants were imported from Britain the better.
“My eye! Listen to Carrie!” said the
startled Joe.
“I notice she has lost that stoop, and
seems to have swelled out about the bust,”
said Rice with a chuckle, as he started to
undo a huge cardboard box.
“Are you going to open ’em?” said Joe.
“Rather! Lock the door, though, and
hang up the notice, ‘Meeting of the Board,’ ”
whispered Rice.
In five minutes the table and sofa were
covered, and the bloques struggled helplessly
to get the underclothing folded up so that it
would show no signs of having been opened.
Oaths and appeals to the Almighty became
frequent. At last Rice flung down an under-
skirt, wiped his forehead, and made a sug-
gestion.
“Let’s just get out and leave the blamed
lot as they are. Carrie’ll find ’em and put
them all right. I’ve got this thing all stained
with perspiration. What do they want to
wear all this lace for when no one can see
it?”
“Oh, ask me something easy,” snorted the
President, dropping a pair of ribbon corsets
into a box on top of the Babe’s leghorn sun
hat and making for the window. “Unlock
the door some of you.”
Joseph lay down under the window when
he had got out. He wanted to hear Carrie’s
remarks about the curiosity of men when
she discovered the bargain-counter in the
dining-room. They were numerous and very
much to the point.
“That girl’s quite a different person now,”
he remarked wisely, as he filled his pipe.
Babe left by the mid-day train. The whole
Order was there to see her off. The plat-
form was crowded with people making for
the mountains, and they all turned their
heads when a grey-eyed girl, dressed in a
grey corselet costume, and carrying a beauti-
ful baby, walked slowly down the platform
in the centre of a group of young men. One
held back the door of the first-class carriage,
and the young lady entered and placed the
Babe on the seat where she could look out
of the window. Babe wore a large leghorn
sun hat (in accordance with the doctor’s
orders), trimmed with white silk and snow-
drops. A little travelling coat of white
watered silk hung gracefully from her baby
shoulders, and on her right wrist was a thin
bangle of gold, which Rice had beaten with
his own hands and cut to make it flash as
though studded with diamonds. Her frock
was of white silk, her shoes of white doe-
skin, and the stockings that covered her
little russet legs were of real lace.
Never was such a gorgeous babe seen on
the platform before.
As the train moved off the Babe waved
her little hand and called out. “Good-bye,
dadas !” The bloques answered with a cheer,
and the people came running from all quar-
ters to see what was going on. They caught
a last glimpse of the Babe as her carriage
swung round the curve, waving her hand to
all her dadas. And then each dada swore
and rushed off to the bar. They wanted
whisky to keep them up. for the sunshine
had gone out of their Elysium.
C. A. JEFFRIES.
A Consideration of Decentral-
isation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DID I read it in the pages
Of some wizard book of old?
Did it happen in the ages
That the poets say were gold?
I forget; but more’s the pity
That, for all our skill to-day,
Nobody can build a city
In the old delightful way.
Now a lot of cash is needful,
And a lot of toil and care ;
Then they wanted but a reedful
Of the clear surrounding air;
Or if harps were more in fashion,
They could turn to bricks and stone
Atmosphere—when filled with passion
Of a string’s ecstatic tone.
Seated somewhere in the middle
Of a green and sylvan mound,
Someone with a golden fiddle
Made a variegated sound ;
Straightway rose a lot o r buildings,
Wall and dome and minaret,
Statues, ornaments and gildings
Branded with the sign “To Let.”
When the mason music ended.
And the joiners’ work was done,
Came a Sultan, rich and splendid,
At the setting of the sun;
It was just the place he wanted,
All his people came to stay,
Taking everything for granted
In the Asiatic way.
There were gardens full of roses,
Lawns as Allah’s turban green,
Where an emerald reposes
Bulky as a soup-tureen ;
Leaping fountains that could spout a
Stream from secret rivers stored,
While they got along without a
Water or a Sewage Board.
They had ports to bring their ships to,
Shops and markets ready-made,
Pleasant spots to take their trips to
When they wanted rest or shade.
Theatres lay round in plenty,
There were pubs of cool retreat,
And I fancy there were twenty
Picture shows in every street.
Could I find that music-maker,
To his place should I repair
And remark: “O gentle faker
Of tall castles in the air,
Let us wander down together
To some places that I know,
And of true Australian weather
Make a dozen towns or so.
“Draw your bow across your fiddle,
Let the palpitating day
Crystallise about the middle
Of a place called Twofold Bay,
To a strain of odds and evens,
Or a waltz-tune if you choose,
Kindly violin Port Stephens
Into something ships can use.
“Scrape your bass strings like a barber
Working hard at union rates,
Till a city at Coff’s Harbor
For the North Coast traffic waits:
And while yet your arm is going,
And your tender music whines,
There could be no harm in bowing
Out a few short railway lines.”
These remarks, if he should heed them,
Might be useful in their way,
Placing cities where we need them
In a single blessed day ;
We might save the useless waiting
For a century or two,
While our statesmen keep on stating
Things that they intend to do.
But the times are somewhat weary,
Music lacks its ancient power,
Only cities brown and beery
Build themselves in one short hour;
Though the kindly breezfe is wafting
Promises with purpose great,
It requires some earnest grafting
To decentralise a State.
Could I find that music-maker,
Could I Fad him by the hair,
And persuade my city-faker
To construct me halls of air,
Even then I shouldn’t wonder
If they pulled his new walls down,
And from buildings burst asunder
Brought the bricks to Sydney town.

Mechanical experts concede the superiority of the design and mechanical principles covered by
The Rochester Helve Power Hammer.
A Special Feature is the use of a Wood Helve preventing the shock of the blow from being transmitted
to the frame and worthing parts of the Hammer, and an extremely powerful, springing, forging blow is obtained.
A patent device allows also of the length and force of the blow being changed instantly
whilst the Hammer is rtiixxiing. This gives complete control of the Hammer, and is indispensable
to the shop where work of various kinds has to be handled on the same machine. No other Helve
Hammer has this feature. Write for Descriptive Catalogue to Sole Agents.
